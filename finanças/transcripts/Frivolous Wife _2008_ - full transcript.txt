Oh, dear... Let's go. damn it! You're dead! I really cannot drink. Please let me go after I drink this. Please! One more glass, sweetie. We're doing it even without knowing each other's names. Nice to meet you. Guys are all the same. I wonder if there is a room available. So long, grand-daughter-in-law wannabe of Imsil head family. Good bye! I'm going to Jeong-do! Family of nobles used to enjoy teas. They picked and dried chrysanthemum in autumn, soft pine needles in Spring, and dried and boiled artemisia as tea. There is also Chinese quince, ginger, countless. Only five teas! dear... What are you doing? You drink tea like water. People often say practices of drinking tea come from Japan but we Koreans have drunk tea since ancient times. don't we call ancestral rites in lunar new year and Thanksgiving ancestor-memorial services? We used to follow the steps to serve tea during ancestral rites, but now it's replaced with scorched-rice tea. Let's go please. are you going to the hall for the elderly? dear... What are you doing, aunt? What are you doing? What were you thinking? You said don't talk back. don't you know the difference between talking back and answering? - When an elder asked you... - I can't hear you. If you have something in your mouth, you spit it out and answer, when you're working, you stop and answer! am I a puppy? do you know what she does whenever she sees me? Oh, dear, look! What? are we filming Petticoat Government? She is married, why such an educated lady doesn't know that? Yeon-soo. What? I love you. Come here. Jeong-do, what are you doing here? We're caught again. Uh... Boss. Shall I call her? No, never mind. She's not my daughter anymore. Okay, well done. all the documents are ready now. Now, all we need to do is bring that daughter? Yes, Ilsung group and Hanseong group are under you, chairman. Chairman? Chairman Nah? It sounds good. I like that. So Mr. Cheon is a loner from now on? You'd think who would use brass dishes these days, but ancestral rites are about devotion. That's why we polish these tarnishable dishes and use them. Yes, aunt. Big events in the head family are serving guests and performing ancestral rites. They are considered as top priority. do you know how difficult it was to perform ancestral rites? In the past, one daughter-in-law of the head family was cooking rice cake for ancestral rite but it wasn't cooked. Relatives came and the time for ancestral rite was near. She was so worried, she hung herself in front of that rice cake. She must've wanted to die. I can understand her. ancestral rites are about devotion. Polish again and again. Yes. dear... Hurry up! There are wooden ones. Why don't I even get sick? 'I'm dizzy! ' 'Please, do the dishes... ' How good would that be? How come I never get sick? I'm pretty and strong. That's your fate, isn't it? You must be destined to become a daughter-in-law of the head family. did I do something wrong to you? What can you do? You got pregnant, have so much work, but your tummy is getting bigger. There is nothing you can do but accept it as your fate. Fate... Son? Daughter? Oh... Yeon-soo, keep an eye on rice cake. - Please hurry. - Yes. We can always buy it. The work will kill me. Things gotta change. Of course! does this make sense in this age? My skin is like sandpaper? ain't I gonna get housewife's eczema? I must've been crazy! I was crazy! How did I end up meeting a human time machine Jeong-do? Why not take me to the Stone age? Oh my... Is this really my face? It wasn't as bad even when my eyes were swollen after eye jobs. Look at the wrinkles under my eyes! What's going on? Oh, my god! Oh, it's hot! Oh, my god! It became charcoal. Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo! Wake up! Rice cake! What am I gonna do? What happened to the rice cake? Why isn't the rice cake not ready? What are you going to do now? Uh... What's that? Happy Ancestral Rite Stop crying. They won't kill you for that. You might just get kicked out. No way! I said stop crying! The worst that can happen is you become a single mom. I hate that even more. What are you doing? What are you drinking? and you're hiding it. Isn't it alcohol? It's wild ginseng wine, a traditional wine passed down in our family. It's really rare, it's served only on elders' birthdays. It's a secret, okay? I became so weak these days so I drank 2 glasses. Wild ginseng wine? Let me take a sip too. No! and you're pregnant, aren't you? I just want to taste it. Well, I got no choice, I think Jeong-do's aunt was in the... Okay, here. I want it here. One full bowl! It won't come out! Because it's so precious, it doesn't come out so well. It's good. Fantastic, cheers! It's good. The smell is different. - I want some more please. - Let's put it back. a bit more! One more bowl! # Not everyone can be the eldest daughter-in-law You're good! # Who said it's easy! What are you doing? Yeon-soo! Let me go! I can't meet other guys! do you know who I am? I'm the first-daughter-in-law of this great family! The rice cake killed itself! Yeon-soo! Yeong-soo! What happened? It could have been serious. She's weak in the first place and stressed with too much house work. You must put her in hospital. What does that mean? What if you lose your grand child? You go back to your home! You belong to your husband's family and you torture my grand daughter-in-law? I knew it from the beginning. Training, discipline, bla bla... You go back home immediately! Yeon-soo... I'm sorry. It's my fault... I forced you to come here and gave you a hard time. My mother experienced the same thing and... Yeon-soo! darling! Honey! Yeon-soo! - I'm sorry. - It's okay. What happened? Yesterday... Uh... Oh, god! What am I gonna do? Wait, what's that look for? She must be so angry. That's why she has that look. I must be hopeless! Uh... don't worry about anything and take some rest. Father forbid everyone to mention what happened yesterday. It's so embarrassing... You were drained, and you fainted because you drank on an empty stomach. dear... I was too harsh on you. I was too eager to teach you. Let's take one step by one step and improve things. When I was getting scolded from grandfather, I remembered my hard time during my living with husband's parents, so I nearly cried. Is she reborn? I heard from Jeong-do. Your family opposed a lot. So you just trusted our family and... You poor thing. How terrible you must've felt when you got pregnant without your mother? Was I really? I was a very poor thing. And I was badly treated and wasn't allowed to eat together. The toilet is so scary, the rice cake ghost is... No. If grandfather finds out he will be angry. But I need to make dinner. - But... - No! Yeon-soo... I will go now. don't go! I'm nearly finished! anybody there? anybody there? That's terrible. Open the door now! Hello. Gosh! The black noodle is getting soggy. What a big house! - Toasted dumpling is for free? - Of course. Please clean the soy sauce jars. Yeon-soo, you clean the toilet. Can I clean the jars? No! It will be a lot of work. I can just wipe it, isn't it? I can do a good job. I really want to do it! Okay! If you really want that... I don't want to clean the toilet. Soy sauce jars! # Let's go to clean soy sauce jars? Soy... sauce jars. This can't be! aunt! I will just clean the toilet! aunt! Let's not talk long. Let's just follow the law. do you think I don't know how to legally treat this matter? We're family and this can't happen among family members. That's embarrassing. although that land is under my name, is that really my property? It belongs to the head family. Frankly, what did the eldest son do for us? What did your family do for descendants? You inherited all the fortune. You are enjoying your wealth! Father. Lunch is ready. I can't give up anyway. If you have wealth, that must be evenly shared. don't you think it's fair? Welcome, nice to meet you. I'm Jeong-do's father. Who's here? Sir, how have you been? How are you? Please let's go in. are you a maid or a cleaner of this house? Why do you do this? It's my job. What have you done to my daughter? Were you tortured? Or did they threaten you? Please have a pleasant conversation. No, sit down. I'm busy, we don't have to talk long. I'm going to take my daughter back. I, I can't go back. I will get married here, have kids and live happily. What? Living like this is happiness? are you out of your mind? don't regret later. Come on, pack your things. Please calm down... Happiness? do you know what real happiness is? You think it's money, right? What's wrong with living like this? I'm being loved by grandfather, father and Jeong-do. Neighbors help my work as if it's theirs. This is what happiness is all about. I'm very happy every day. Frankly, things were a little bit inconvenient at first, but this is better now. do you understand? Money, you like money, right? Grandfather, how much land does this family own? I'm not sure. about 220,000 square meters? Have I talked about money? Money doesn't make you rich. do you know poor mind and poor soul make people miserable? I realized that I was poor after I came here. If mum was alive, she wouldn't have opposed. She'd be proud of me. I'm not going back. I can't go back. This is my home. I'm going to become the 13th eldest grand daughter - in-law of Chongtangong family. Good bye. Sir. You came a long way, have lunch before you go. It's okay. I don't think I can swallow anything in this situation. Since you set the table, I will stay. Thank you. It's not much, but please help yourself. I'm staying for you. Thank you. Please make yourself at home and enjoy. This is wild ginseng wine. This is for special guests only. In-law, please don't worry. It will be alright. You called me in-law again. do you think I've changed mind over just few glasses of this wine? Please don't call me that! Yeon-soo is everything to me. Without her, I have nothing. We're one family now. don't think you've lost your daughter, but think you got a new family! did you say family? Yes! a new family? Sir! You know, I... I met Yeon-soo's mother when I was 19, and became a father at 20. I was penniless so I couldn't give Yeon-soo's mother a medical treatment not even once. after she passed away, Yeon-soo doesn't even call me father. So I made money like crazy. I thought that's what was best for YeonSoo. So I just made money. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir... So we were too soft on them. We must show how tough we are to people like them, so they don't do it again. The situation got worsen because I didn't handle it wisely. I'm not trying to determine who is right or wrong. It's just the time is tough on us. So what should we do? We may lose not only our dignity but the land as well. If this happens because of one tough person, other family members will get swayed. Well... grandfather. Yeon-soo... I know one land expert and he's close by. an expert? There is nothing to worry about. This is not even a case. If you look at Real Estate act article 48 clause 9, there're details about authority related to group-owned land for the purpose of non-profit making. it's embarrassing to even take it to the court... If you consider it a disgrace, you can request for withdrawal of the suit. There is no need to go to the court. If you look at the documents sent by them, there are many defects so it's 99% likely to be withdrawn. Please look after Yeon-soo. Sweet rice drink was so well made. It's nice, isn't it? Yes, it was very good. Sweet Rice Drink The rest will be taken care of by manager Jeong. Oh, if it's not solved legally, there are many ways, so just tell me. Thank you. did you call me because of this? No, I missed you. In-law. Thank you for many things, for helping us. Thank you very much. Isn't it obvious that families are to help each other? See you... dad! dad? Wow! She called him dad. I really missed you. Thank you, dad. do you like him that much? No, not as much as you. That's okay, then. Ji-sook... Hey, Yeon-soo is getting married. She's going to become the grand daughter-in-law of a very distinguished family. I raised her well, didn't I? What is the noise? You must leave now! What do you mean? Mudang group has just invaded us. What about In-seok? He's not seen since this morning. You take care of the customers in the shop and evacuate them. - You must leave first. - We'll take care of it here. Since when did you talk back to me? Go now! 1st and 2nd floor got broken in already! Please leave now! Mr. Cheon, long time no see. InSeok! I'm sorry. Boss, well, life is funny, isn't it? You should have treated me better when I was here. Today is the last day to call you boss. Mr. Cheon. You must leave for us. Okay, I'll leave. Let's finish the matter. No way! do you think I'm stupid? I heard you transferred all the ownership to your daughter? - did you say she is in Sooncheon? - Yes. Get him! Boss! You bastards! Boss! are you okay? Go to Yeon-soo. To Yeon-soo! Kick. What's going on? - Father! - Sir! - What's going on? - They will be here soon. Help us! dad! Yeon-soo! I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Family is in danger, we must get together. Attention, please. attention. Residents in the castle and everyone of Chongtangong family. As soon as you hear this broadcasting, please come to the central yard in the castle. This is an emergency. We're ready. Let's go. are you all here from the eldest aunt's? You have people who go out when time comes. If she is here, we're all here. What? Why did you bring that little girl? Who will take the blame if she gets hurt? Brother-in-law! Why did you bring that agrochemical can? If I spray this agrochemical, they will all die! You're such a worry. What are you doing here? am I not part of Lee family? You have familyship! Good! Good! You have become wise at last. Chongtan! Everyone's here. We protected the castle by raising civil army during Japanese invasion. We led the March First Proclamation for independence at the market during Japanese ruling period. and we, Chongtangong family won the Mt. Jiri battle during Korean War. Yes! Now, it's time for us to save family-in-law of Lee family. We are not to fight, but to protect our family that is the most important in the world. Let's show them our unified spirit of Chongtangong family in this right fight. Right! I think we've prepared enough with this plan. What do you think? - I think it's enough. - Okay. and since Yeon-soo has a baby, send her somewhere safe. - alright. - Grandfather! Honey, please stay inside. Let's go! Move forward! Line up! Let's show our will! Hey! What are you doing there? Come here, quick! Mr. Cheon! Why don't you come down with your daughter? Smoking is banned in the castle. What are you doing? Bastards! Break in! How about some shit! This is good shit. Where do you think you're coming? Father! Look! Is that a ladder truck, isn't it? Ilsung group has arrived. Sir, It's not working let's go for plan B. Son, get it ready now. - First we... - Plan B! Change to plan B! Change to plan B! We will all die if we move slowly. Run fast! Get inside! Get inside! Hurry! Hurry! Come out now! It's over. Mr. Cheon, I lose. Come here! What? damn it! I'm not finished yet! - Yeon-soo! - Yeon-soo! don't come near, damn it! don't come near! - Get them all! - I got it! God, how dare they attack our family? Sir! are they the last ones? This one is the under boss and that one is the boss. They're all we captured. There are so many of them. For what did you come down all the way here? Sergeant Lee! What? This bastard? It's me. You shit! You're dead! Sir! I want to thank you for your kindness. We're one family. You don't need to say that. By the way, where are the kids? Oh! There they come. I don't wanna deliver a baby! It's a boy! a boy! They say the eldest grandson lives in the past. They're right. The eldest grandson lives in the past. And they live looking at the future. So the eldest grandson and his wife... become one part of the past and the future. It was not a romantic wedding I dreamt of and there was no prince. Although my pride was hurt a bit, I was honest with my feelings and my marriage proposal was more gracious than any other luxury goods. It also brought me family, that is more precious than any happiness in the world. - Sparrow. - Chirp chirp. Please hold on a sec. anyone there? Is anyone there? Welcome. Welcome to the head family house of great teacher Choo-gye. I'm the 13th eldest grand daughter-in-law of Chongtangong family. Park Jeong-ah Park Jin-woo Subtitles by LeapinLar
