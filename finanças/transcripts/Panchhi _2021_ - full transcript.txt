Gulli, What does a snake do? It stings. Does the man die? Hmm... But if he still survives? Man kills the snake. That means the defeated will die. No one is either right or wrong. It would have been unfair, if everyone was correct. Also unfair, if everyone was wrong. If there is a day, there is a night. If sad times come, happy days follow. Black and white both exist. Just like you and I. You appear black outwardly, but you're pure by heart. The white is black by heart. [THEME MUSIC] Panchhi, devastated by the heat of blood relations. No one can catch him or can understand. Social Education was his favourite subject in the school. These people are those ones, for whom nothing is right For him, wrong isn't right and right isn't wrong. Panchhi, nephew of Mr. Rajaram.

Will you spend some? Ahh.? Then I'll do some makeshift. -Now you have come to the main point. -Yes. Now, hang up the phone. Hang up! Hey, you? What are you doing here? -Why are you smiling? -Get disappear from here. Get lost! -Everywhere creating trouble. -They don't let me relax neither in hospital or at home. I cure patients in hospital not at home. [Panchhi] I do at home. -Hmm? Where did you come from? Dear, you do one thing. Come to the hospital tomorrow. I'll examine you first. You stay here, I'll cure you here only. One minute. Only one minute Where is the injection, where is the medicine. Here I found the injection. Scoundral, are you a goon? You were scaring me.

People say that we should remember God before the death. Remember your God. You're a doctor, similar to God. Yes, yes. What's your name? L. K. Lal. Say L. K. Lal. L. K. Lal. [GUN SHOT] [LAUGH] What happened, Sir? Do you watch movies? Yes, I do. Look there. Who is she? Mother India. Mother India? To whom Lala said, 'Radha Rani... come to me. I'll return your bangles.' She didn't go to him. She left the village and came to the city. She didn't know... that there was only one who could exploit her... but here in the city, they are plentiful. Yeah...just moving. Is this a Ranjit Mani's CD? Yes. Put the famous song of him. [LOUD HORN] You, scoundrel! [FOLK SONG] Drive carefully, brother. Are you blind? I'll also beat you. Mind your own business. [ARGUMENTS] Hey you.. -Get him out of the car. -Sorry. Sir, Sir.. Sir, please save me. They'll kill me. Last paragraph is left. [FOLK SONG CONTINUES] [Boys] Now you laugh. You want to screw up with us. Please leave me. Please leave me. [GASP] [Driver] Brother, brother. These three men are beating you and you are taking it. Ahh? You can also give them, one or two punches at least. Undersood or not? You didn't understand. I'll make you understand. See what I would have done if I was at your place. These three would have beaten up me. I would have punched at least one out of three. Ahh? If I beated them, they would have beaten me even more. Seeing me beaten up, the one I beated, would be happier. He would be happy and I would have shot him. [GUN SHOT] [GASP AND RUN] Welfare pays nothing. You already started laughing. Well, good. People would say he died laughing. Panchhi Panchhi Panchhi If I remove uncle's wart, he'll look handsome. [PAINFUL SHOUT] Where were you all these days? Dubai. How much newspaper scrap pays these days? How many quintals do you have? [PANCHHI LAUGHING] You look very happy. Do you know your cousin has got engaged? No, I don't know. Brother, I don't understand your uncle and his mind. You are elder. You should have got married first. When your parents died, your uncle used to talk big. "I'm taking all the responsibilities of Panchhi." "I'll love Panchhi more than my own son." I was furious... Nothing can happen of him. Congratulations Gore! You got engaged. -Have some sweets. -Wait, a customer is here. I'll offer it to the customer too. Brother, have it. My brother has got engaged. Ahh.. You got engaged when I was in Dubai. Now you grow up. Otherwise, I'll have to go to 'your' Dubai. -I'll distribute sweets to all. -Yes, do it. -Hey, listen to me. -Hmm.. Sit here. The middle woman was backbiting about two rings from our side. The girl seems smart and intelligent. Even if the girl was maniac, we would have done the matchmaking, just for the shops in her name. Hmm.. As soon as Roshan told me that they are only two sisters and no brother... I immediately said yes for this match. But why? Look.. -Gora has two shops. -Hmm -Panchhi has three. -Yes. -Those shops are also ours. -Yes. My name is Raja Ram. -I'll take a sigh of relief by making your son a king. -[Aunt Chuckles] I don't want to eat. I don't understand that how you can digest this sweet. [EATING SOUND] If it was in my hands, I would have broken up this new relationship before it was made even. Let's break it now. Eat it at least now. Brother, what will you do to fall out the relationship? -Have you watched the movie 'Kacche Dhaage'? -Yes. -It has a sung by singer 'Hansraj'. -Which one? Whether it's a relationship or a heart... eventually it breaks. eventually it breaks. Isn't this song from the movie 'Asha' which picturised on Reena Roy. I don't know. He has been engaged with the girl from this house. Hey, what are you doing? -Hmm? -Hmm.. [GUN SHOT] Ohh.. Let's see number of members in the family. One Two Three Four Five Hey, these all are neigbours. One Two Is this the girl? No, she is her younger sister. Is she unmarried? Yes. Now this relationship won't be called off. It will remain intact. Shall we leave? Just wait for two minutes. Hours have been passed in the name of your 'two minutes'. Shall we leave now? Gulli, two more minutes please. [BREATHING RAPIDLY] You came fifteen minutes late. I asked you to come at four. I have done three rounds and ten more left. [YAWN SOUND] It's been your third round around this house. We have to finish twenty rounds. Not around this house, go somewhere else. Who are you to stop us? Your brother-in-law. [LAUGHTER] Brother, shall we leave? I'm getting tanned in the sun. [FOLK SONG] -The girl looks pretty. Son, look at the photo. -She is so beautiful. The younger one also looks gorgeous. Hey.. Don't be oversmart. If you've got the elder one, that too is only because you own five shops in the share. Moreover, those are not yours even. Those belong to Panchhi. Do you have an idea even what all have I done to get you those shops? I started giving drugs to Panchhi when he was just seven years old, and he has been sick since then. I have spent my life but I don't want you to suffer. He is my brother. What if he is my cousin. See, his indications. You also need to have some patience. You always nag him. I'll make him understand. She will make him understand!? Hey, what happened? Gulli dear, I'm not feeling like doing anything. Just wait till morning. You'll be cured. [FOLK SONG] [FUNNY SOUND] Wow! Ms Usha has got the best daughter-in-law. [LAUGHING] Gora is no less handsome. Yes, you are right. But Panchhi is more handsome than Gora. Hey Panchhi, sit on the lap of your sister-in-law. He is an elder brother-in-law, that too unmarried. -Go, go.. sit. -Don't shy. Sister-in-law, I'm Panchhi, your elder brother-in-law. Hmm.. Bittoo, these two guys from the groom's side, are still here. Please drop them to their home. Aunt, actually we left our charger here. -Hey, what are you looking for? -Charger. What are you doing? Ahmm.. Charger. Are you charged now? Gore, shall I open the shop in the morning and you come later? Sister-in-law must feel lonely at home. Shalu is also not there with her anymore. Hmm? [SHUTTER SOUND] Hmm? [Boys] Hey Gore, How are you doing? How was your first night? [Laugh] -Gore -[Gora] Yes -Show us your sister-in-law's photo at least. Your wedding photos album must have come. We will get a girl for Panchhi too. [Boys] He'll also get someone to look after him. Gore, please show us at least one photo of your sister-in-law. The wedding album hasn't come yet. Also, the photographer was from the bride's side. [Boys] Anyways, leave that. How's sister-in-law doing? Photographer. Are you alright? Hello sir. Sir, I want to see Seema Bhabhi's wedding pictures. Sir.. [FUNNY SOUND] Brother, here it is. Did you click only one photo of mine? Do one thing. Merge me with them in the same frame. Just photoshop it. It'll take some time. What's the use of the computer, then? Is there any solo photo of her? Whose, Shalu's? [SLAP] [STUNNED] You scoundrel, how could you guess her name? Ahh.. This is it, sir. Where did you click this? -Ahh.. -Ahhh? It was clicked at other ceramonies. Make it as big as that one is. It'll be done sir. [Aunt] Hello..hello -Who is this? Ohh..Shalu is speaking. [Aunt] chuckles -How are you dear? Is everyone fine at home? Yes sure, I'll make you talk to your sister. Hey Panchhi, come here. Come. Tell Seema that Shalu is on phone, talk to her. -What's wrong with you? Take the phone. Look at him, he is shying. [KISS] -Yes, is there a call? -For me? Who is on line? Hmmm? [chuckles] Hello Yes Shalu, You are coming... Coming tomorrow. Yes, yes please come. I'll send your brother-in-law to pick you from the bus stand. Ohhh [WHISTLE] [FUNNY SOUND] [Seema] Shalu, you have come. Did your brother-in-law reach on time? Did you have a safe travel? How's mom and everyone back at home? Mom, Shalu has arrived. [Aunt] Was there any problem on the way? Is everyone fine at home? Oh God! Shall we make a programme for tonight? I have heard that Gora's sister-in-law has come to his place. That's great! From tomorrow onwards, we'll play football in the neighborhood. Brother, we have a Sunday match tomorrow as usual. Leave the match now. Get me some cigarettes. Get one for me too. He keeps talking nonsense. Give me some cigarettes. [FOOTBALL CHATTER] She is so beautiful. O Lord, I wish she comes to me and says, 'Johny, where have you been for these many days?' It'll take me only two or three days to impress her. -O shit! Did she heard us? -Ahhh..? Dude, don't get us insulted. Come, brother. Oh hello.. I also want to play. -Stop now. -I'm done with my excercise. Let's have tea, if you have time. Let's go. Uncle, give four cups of tea. By the way, I play at the national level. But to me, it seems that you have never played at the state level even! No, no.. We have a football match on Sunday. [LAUGH] Ok, I'll take a leave. Ahh..Miss Shalu.. Are you on Fehbook? [Nods] Do accept my friendship request. You got it. [chuckle] [FUNNY SOUND] [PAINFUL SCREAM] Gulli, make a list of all those who want to play the internationals. Oh hello.. Say the name. Did you send the friend request? No.. -Please forgive me. -I said the wrong things. -Panchhi, please forgive me. [SOBBING] Create my account on Fehbook. I'll make it. You need to have a photograph for that. Click then. Click. -Listen dear. [Seema] Yes. You please cousel Shalu that... Here, people are conservative. They were talking about her that she was playing football with boys. Even the people who stand nowhere, were also gossiping. Even the boys are also not very sensible. Ok dad, I'll explain it to her. But you don't worry about Shalu. She knows how to tackle such boys. People criticize you in both the conditions, whether you ask for help or can defend on your own. Dear, precaution is better than cure. Ok. Gulli, what all can be done without being friends on Fehbook? Whatever you expect will not happen. Stand up. Arouse your inner Romeo. Bring it out. Go and tell her. Kiran.. Shalu.. Oh yes.. Shalu.. I love you. Panchhi loves Shalu. Hmm? Go.. Yes.. Tell me. Speak up. Hmm.. [SOBBING] [ANGER] [Panchhi] Gulli, I couln't speak in front of her. You fool, who goes like this? You should have brought a gift for her. Gift? Do you have any useless thing at your home? -Yeah. -Some scrap? -Yes -Anything, that can be useful? What about that big photograph which you got framed by the photographer? Yes. Write I Love You. From, Panchhi. Write it down. Why are your hands shaking? Write it. Just write, PANCHHI. Rajaram, you have started dressing up well since the time the daughter-in-law has come. -My son is good but the daughter-in-law is much better. -Ok. She takes good care of the family. -That's a good thing. -hmm... Hey.. What are you doing? Dad, I need some money. If you need money, just ask me. Moreover, what do you have to do with it? I need to buy Seema something . She should ask her mother-in-law whatever she needs. She will get her everything. Dad, some things are personal between husband and wife. After marriage, you seem to be over smart. Dad, I have an equal right on the earnings. I have put my heart and soul in making everything. If I'll give you all the rights, you'll finish everything in few days. So, what? It's not your hard earned money. This shop belongs to Panchhi. Don't speak rubbish! You never underdstand what I try to teach you. You won't be successful in life. -Here is your money! -Keep it with you. Gore.. Take this packet. Your father ordered it. What is it? Capsules to increase strength. [Gora] Take the keys and open the shop on your own. I'm not going to give you any authorization, but you still have to come on time. -Shall we leave? -Yes. You leave. I'll come on my own. Sister.. This.. -Hello brother. -Hello Panchhi, how are you? Hmm.. How's sister-in-law? Yeah, all are fine. Those are cherry ones? Those boxes need cleaning. The girl who has come home does she have exams? No she doesn't have exams. Will she stay for few days? Yeah, she'll be here. Hmm.. Have your wedding album come? Hmm? Not yet. Ok. Didn't even get enlarged framed? No, we didn't framed any photo. Panchhi, hand me some cumin biscuit. Panchhi come home tomorrow, your sister-in-law will make her first kitchen. Sister, pass me that vegetable. Take it. You take this and I'll get chapatis. Alright. How's the preparation going for National level? I have applied for further studies from Manipal University. I'm not playing football these days. That's good. [Uncle] Hey, what happened? Are you not eating? Girls, there is no curry in his bowl. [To aunt] Why aren't you taking care of all this while sitting here? She is coming. Why are you becoming restless? Dear, get some more chapatis for him. No, thank you. I'll have only one. Only one? Look at these youngsters. They have less appetite. At this age also, I can have a quarter of ghee in one go. Get up. Let's compete in squats. Why are you laughing? Come and do it. Come..count it. See this. See this. I consume the strength-building capsules. This is the source of strength. My son Panchhi... you are into self-grooming these days. Dumbo, you should have written your name. But you wrote Gora. He is her brother-in-law. Hello.. I'm Shalu this side. Panchhi, where are you? Where are we right now? On the terrace. On the terrace. Ok, listen to me. Do meet me in Dharamshala at four o'clock. Hello? Panchhi? Ok dear.. Was it her call? What did she say? She called me to meet her today. WAH Do I look handsome? NO Hey You Listen to me. I hope I'm not late. I was nervous. I want to tell you something. The framed picture of yours was sent by me. Although it had the names of my brother and his wife. I can't call out your name. Making an eye-contact with you is more difficult. Is it yours? This is the same which you tried for youself. And I.. bought it. You.. keep mine. I shall keep yours. You aren't speaking to me.. Are you angry with me? Or you also can't call out my name? Do you also shy? I wish.. I talk to you by looking into your eyes. Shalu, I love you. You say.. Panchhi, I also love you so much. You aren't speaking. Are you also nervous like me? You're not blinking your eyes also. You're not breathing even. Are you dead? Shalu.. [NERVOUS] [PAINFUL SCREACH] Cinema has spoiled people like you. You have learnt hurting and killing people. You, so called lover. You have killed the girl. You need to understand the life in real. Don't take it as a part of a movie. where you can kick in the constable's chest and can run away. He ran away! What happened? Sir, he ran away. -How? -As you explained. Go, catch him. Stop him. He shouldn't escape. Stop! As you can see we are live from the house of the accused, the one who killed a 23 years old woman last night. The police have been investing the case. The dead body has been sent for the post mortem. The report will clear the cause of death. Let's talk to the people from this area. We'll get to know Panchhi's character. What would you like to say about him? He was an innocent man. He never got into any fights or arguments. He was a sincere citizen. He never answered back to anyone. Do you think he killed the girl? No, I don't think so. He couldn't harm an animal even. No brother. He carried a gun also. People taunted him for his behaviour. Once he also hit me in my head... for me calling him 'crazy'. He got annoyed at every small thing. He was good with those who didn't mess with him. [Reporter] As you can see, some people found him innocent. [Reporter] But some people also say that he owned a pistol. They are sure that Panchhi is the killer. But it'll only get resolved after the Police investigation. [SHUTTER SOUND] Dear, why did you kill her? I didn't kill her. But, everyone is saying this. All are lying. Why did you go there? You were there when I received the call from her. I had a dream that she hasn't died. Stop dreaming. She has died. Tomorrow is her cremation. I was waiting for you but you didn't come. It's ok. Come now. My friend, what are you doing? She was here. She is calling me as she is waiting for me. She won't come. Shalu, I have come. Shalu, I have come. Hey! Have you gone mad? What are you doing? Hey, you! What happened? She was here. Dear, she has died. I know... who killed her. Who? You killed her! She didn't accept your friend request on Fehbook. So, you killed her. You killed her! Panchhi, leave him. [Johny] I didn't kill her. Leave him. Leave... I won't spare you. -People are recording you on phones. -I will kill you because you killed her. -I won't leave you. Gulli, leave me. [Reporter] As you can see on your TV screens, we are showing you the video which has gone viral. In the video, you can see a young man has been beaten up brutally. Earlier, the video went viral, and today, the man has been found dead. The Police have reached here. The killer of this man is the same who murdered the girl named Shalu, few days ago. The residents of this area believe that Panchhi is the killer who ended Shalu's life also. Now the case is out of hand. Panchhi, you have to run off. He is half mental. He was in a rehabilitation centre for two years. -Hmm.. -He was all fine till he met the girl. -Hmm.. -He lost his parents at a young age. I did his upbringing. So, I know everything about him. He didn't seem a gentleman. I'm sure he has only killed the girl. Yes, you tell me Although my father knows him better, I don't think he could do such a crime. Yes, you tell me. Now-a-days, your video has gone viral You have become hero, right? [Fearfully] Sir, I was trying to save Johny. Panchhi would have killed him. You must have seen in the video. I held Panchhi off Johny to save him. I'm speaking the truth. You both used to hang out together. What? You both used to hang out together. Sir, it was not like that. I was with him only because he was not much sensible. He is your friend, right? No, we aren't friends. He is crazy. He used to come to my shop to pass his time. It has nothing to do with me. I swear on my mother. Listen to me. Tell me clearly where he is. Else, I know other ways too to bring it out from you. [Crying] sir.. -Stay away! I'm poor. I have this small business. I have nothing to do with him. Look, just tell me if you know where he is. If you try to escape, you know what the result will be. Understood? Whenever you will be called, you'll have to be present in the Police station. I'm honest and truthful. I won't escape anywhere and will come to you whenever required. I'm asking you once again, tell me if you know where Panchhi is. No sir, I don't know. Ok. -Don't try to escape. -Thank you. Let's leave. [SOBBING] Panchhi Panchhi, get up. Sit. Give it back to him. The charges of Shalu's murder are in your name. So for Johny's. I think the killer is one of your known people. Someone is trying to get you into this trap. Only you know me the best. Have you lost your mind? You were there when I received the call. Only you knew about the plan of our meeting. Why would I kill her? to trap me. Why would I outwit you? Lottery. It was only you who knew about it. And I would win it. You want to send me behind the bars and will run away with my money. You are not as innocent as you seem. I think you have killed her. [GUN SHOT] What shall we do now? Gulli, do you really think that I killed Shalu? [POLICE WHISTLE] Hey! Come on, run! [Cops] Stop there. Where are you running? [Cops] Stop.. stop.. Sir, you? Sir, I'll play your favorite song. Here you go. Sir, do you remember that place? Radha Rani's? But she has gone back to the countryside. Shall I tell you one thing? I think Lala must have expired. There's a check post ahead. I think you just have done something good to someone, like you did to me. Sir, I don't know how many more people will benefit from you. Sir, do one thing. Just fly away. [COP] Sir, Panchhi is here. -Catch him. -Sir, he ran away. Panchhi, what happened to you? Why did you do it? I didn't do it. I know you didn't do it. You have been tricked since your childhood. Everything happened in front of my eyes. But I couldn't do anything. My father just zipped my mouth. I can't see you suffering like this. You have been drugged and demented by my father since your childhood. For what? For your three shops. He even got me my spouse from the family where there's no son. For what? For property. That's why Shalu was like an obstacle in his greedy eyes. I don't know whether I'm taking it right or wrong... I think it was all done by Dad. Did you find any evidence at the crime location? No... When I reached there, I found her dead. Something like a pair of spectacles? Yes. But, it was Shalu's. No, it was not Shalu's. It was Dad's. -He is my Dad. -I won't have any grudges for you. Panchhi, kill him. How did you get to know that it was there? I have got the tag of 'half mental'. But you acted the same. You were on cloud nine since Shalu came home. -Your mental health started improving. Gradually, Shalu also started noticing you. You are innocent, but she was very smart. I wanted to get the property of both the sisters. Dad already got your property in my name. I could visualise the whole property go to you when I saw shalu calling you. Panchhi, where are you? Ok, listen to me. Do meet me in Dharamshala at four o'clock. Yes dear, what's going on? No sister, nothing is like what is being cooked in your mind. I know how everything falls into place eventually. I'll make him understand the reality. After the meeting, what would you be to me, younger sister-in-law or the elder? My brother is innocent. You never know if he reaches there before the time. It's better if you go a half an hour early. Ok. I'll go before the time. I wanted to kill two birds with one stone. But you blocked the road by being at Shalu's side. That's why I killed her... kept Dad's specs at the location. You would doubt my father and kill him. I called the cops. You being lost in her love, stood there. Police reached there and you got arrested. We both were fortunate that you ran away from the Police custody. You doubted Johny instead of Dad. It was again my good luck. Johny's video went viral. Unfortunately, Johny was killed for no reason. I was so pissed off with my father. I wanted to get rid off him. You had to get arrested. This time also, my fate was in my favor. I found you in the middle of the road. When I looked at your poor condition, I planned... to get my father killed by you. But this time, it was your good luck... and mine was bad. You should have asked me... Everything belonged to you. I have always been satisfied to see you happy. Why didn't I get the same in return? Brothers are not for all this. Let me be happy again to see you. So do you. [PAINFUL SOUND] [PAINFUL LAUGH] Gulli Get the sack. Gulli, What does a snake do? It stings. Does the man die? Hmm... But if he still survives? Man kills the snake. Black and white both exist. Just like you and I. You appear black outwardly, but you're pure by heart. The white is black by heart. Dear life, I'm a failure child of you. If wish I never have your experience again. Panchhi.. Panchhi.. Panchhi.. Panchhi..
