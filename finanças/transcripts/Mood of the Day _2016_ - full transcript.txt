Been busy? Haven't seen you lately. Have I? I think I can make dinner. I have a boyfriend. Then call me when you're done. MOON CHAE-WON YOO YEON-SEOK Damn. KANG Jin-cheol won't pick up. His management won't either. No one's at the office. Say that no one's available when someone calls. Where the heck is Jin-cheol? I know. Hold on, Jae-hyun's calling. Okay. Hello. MOOD OF THE DAY KANG JIN-CHEOL DISAPPEARED BEFORE GOING TO THE NBA - Damn... - Ma'am. Oh my god. Are you okay? What... Whatever. I was too embarrassed. Did you get a hold of his management? No. The department store probably heard he's missing too. Won't that affect the PT? I'll have to try, I guess. It turned off. This will do it. Just buy one. I'm surprised it works. It's fine. I can fix it. What if it turns off during something important? It's too old. What about the thing I asked? Is this it? I know it's not your style. But nice, right? The color... it's... Everyone should wear pink. Pink! Pink! The size... it's... You'll like these. Sexy. Hot. Yeah, I saw the game. You're movement looks good but work on your speed. Oh and especially the shoulder pass. - The team is in turmoil. - Huh? They want a mercenary. The last tryout didn't work. - Which tryout? - The kid with the good pass work. Okay, got it. Min-ho, let's win those last two games! Then I can guarantee you 2.5 million after this season. Got it? Drop the NBA has-beens and look for college stars with triple-doubles. Have the list on my desk before lunch. Yes, sir! I found him! Jin-cheol. Hurry! Hey, Byung-hee. What's going on with you and Yoon-joo? Slow down. Saw it. Nice catch. - Whatever. - Hey! You dog. What is it? Just wait. I'll tell you when she gets here. - Did you call her? - I did. Hey Soo-jung. Have a seat. What's up? Two tickets for the 10 o'clock Busan. Right. Did you take the girl out after drinks yesterday? Sorry but no seats are available together. That's fine. Did you have sex? They're in different compartments. Is that okay? Yes. Please. Did you do it? You dig her, don't you? No. It's not like that. Here you go. Two tickets. Thank you, Sol-ji! Thank you, Sol-ji! Asshole. How is it so easy for you? Tada. Are you sure? Didn't you just meet the guy? If you think time spent together is important, Soo-jung should've... Congratulations! Who is he? Right! He says that he went to high school with you. Really? Who? Min-seok. OH Min-seok. Oh my god. You know him? I have no idea. Never heard the name. Right? No idea. Right... It doesn't ring a bell... - Doesn't... Right... - OH Min-seok. Aren't you going to Busan? Go. You should leave. Yoon-joo, let's talk again when we get back. Sure. Have a safe trip. Right. I'm off. My horoscope says, "You're in for a tough ride." I'm never going to find Jin-cheol. - Did you send flowers to the funeral? - Yes. Let's see yours. Gee! Yours says "You only get one shot." Maybe we find him after all! Why are you so lucky. Hurry up! Jae-hyun. Don't leave me. - Let's go together. - Yours. See you soon. ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT? MIN-SEOK IS YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SWEET HEART. YOU TOLD HER? - NO, SHOULD I? - I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU DO. YOU NEVER REALLY HAD A CHANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND YOON-JOO... I GUESS IT'S DESTINY. Something out there? Huh? You were staring with intent. Did you have breakfast? - I'm fine. - Please. I don't even know you. What? You're my neighbor. Seat neighbor. Come on now. Okay. It's good right? Yup... Where are you heading? Busan. For work? Me too. That's destiny. Or coincidence. Are you okay? Do you have napkins? No. - Banana milk? - No, ma'am. - Coffee milk? - We're all out of that too. Excuse me. SWEETHEART Your phone... Hello? My apologies, ma'am. Excuse me. I'm sure he didn't mind. Hey you! Your phone? Hello? One second. Hi. I had such a rough day. You won't even believe when... Soo-jung. Huh? Can you send my laptop ASAP? I told you in the morning that I have a business trip. Right... Okay then. Busy? I'm busy. Let's talk later. Okay then... Is this a move? Is that not allowed? I have a boyfriend. Right. I see... You're basically giving me a green light by drinking that... Or is it not. Of course it isn't. Take it. Here. I don't mind. Anyway I like you. Especially this feeling... - Let's keep this straight. - What? I really don't like flaky characters like you. Okay. Then it's my style that's the problem, not your boyfriend. I like your honesty. Then I'll be honest too. I'm thinking of sleeping with you tonight. You're my type. What? You're crazy. This is crazy. Here. You're in my seat. Sorry... - You're in my seat. - Sorry... Why? Sorry. Excuse me. Not a word from you until we get to Busan. Fine. Whoever talks first buys dinner. Okay? I thought you were the one that was going to marry the first among all of us. You were popular. You mean I'm still popular. BAE Soo-jung... Whatever. Why the laugh? - I really mean it. - Cut the crap. Just now a man asked me to sleep with him. What? You're sleeping with a stranger? - Soo-jung! - What's going on? You think Jin-cheol is replaceable? Never mind. If we don't get him in the NBA, we're all finished. Got it? Check up on it and call me. Excuse me... Dinner's on you. When you said Jin-cheol, did you mean basketball star? So dinner is on? Are you on your way to meet him? In Busan? D.I.N.N... - Okay! It's on me. - Okay. You confirmed it. Are you sure? Yeah. The name and the number are all correct! How did you meet him? - Then you can... - I'll call you soon. I'll do whatever it takes to get there. Let's get off. It's Mi-ryang. Here? I thought you needed Jin-cheol's autograph. Wasn't it important? I guess not. See you in another coincidence. What... What should I do. Wait. You're sure that we can see him? Of course we can. Hello? Damn. I'm out of time. I'll bring it right back. Are you doing this to me? I have no time. - Fine.Fine. - Thanks man. We're running late. You only show up when you need something. Oh no... Jin-cheol... He's not leaving for the States? Of course he is. This is a one-shot opportunity. - The time... - We got it. Is she your girlfriend? No... I'm... a friend. You're beauty lights up Busan! Busan... - Amazing. - Yo. What. She's a friend. Did you go to school in Busan? Hell, yes! Why didn't I see you. The name's KIM Jae-hyun. Friends should at least know each other's names. It's BAE Soo-jung. Really? Soo-jung? You turned out nice. TAKE A PICTURE OF HIM. Let's hang after we get you Jin-cheol's autograph. I told you, I have a boyfriend. Nobody's asking you out. Let's just have some fun. I don't "hang" with people as flakey as yourself. Do you know anything about me? - No. - Then? I'm not that kind of girl. Can I help you? I'm Jin-cheol's basketball friend. She's my wife. I see. Jin-cheol's not around. The press has been driving us crazy. - Please come in. - Of course... I don't think he'll show up. I'm leaving. I think I'll be late for my PT. Have a seat. I promise I'll drive you there. Where are your manners? You need to buy me dinner. This will do. Fine. That sounds reasonable. This will do. No, I'm good. Okay. Just fill your glass. I need to drive. That's it. Such a prude. Don't you worry. I'm totally fun with a lot of things. Really? Like what? A lot of things. What? What? Never mind. I'd rather not talk with you. I told you I won't drink... Dad... Dad... Dad... Dad... Are you crying? What is wrong with me today... Why did you cry? It just reminded me of something. Who? Did someone pass? My father. I'm sorry... It's fine. It was long ago. Have you been to Busan a lot? I think it's my first time since college. There's an amazing restaurant called the Rainbow Diner. You want to have lunch after your PT? - The soup is amazing... - I need to go to Seoul right away. Such a busy one. Busy. What's wrong with being busy? I'm guessing you've never cheated? What... Why are you so defensive? We won't see each other once you leave this car. How long have you been dating? 10 years. Ten... Wow. So the legend is true. What's the fun in that? Why aren't you married? I am going to get married. Yeah. Right. Just because I won't sleep with you doesn't mean that I'm boring. I'm actually very progressive. Have you ever had a one-night stand? Since when did sleeping with one person become so boring? Men totally ruined it. It's such a good thing. What's wrong with men? They're setting the wrong definition of "fun." Are you satisfied with that one person? Then what about you? - What's the point of mas... - Mas what? Mas... Mas... Speak up. No-one's around you see? Why is having sex better than masturbating? Watch it! It's a cooperation thing. Can't be done alone. That's called emotion. So what I'm saying is that you should sleep with someone you love. Because that brings out emotion. Fine. Okay. Then can't emotion happen during a one-night stand? Forget it. You're basically sexually harassing me right now. This a felony. A felony! And I guess hidden cams aren't? Hidden cam? What...? Let's see. This. I was trying to get the scenery. Sure... You should've just asked you know. I told you it was a mistake! Fine. Here! Okay. This makes us even. You agree? Good bye. Hey! If you have something to say. Spill. We won't see each other anyways. No. Have a lot of sex and die. Excuse me. My phone? Call me if you change your mind and want to sleep with me. Miguhara, please ready yourself. Yes. Oh my god. Where? The noodle place? Do you see a yellow jeep? Okay. Saw it. By the light. Turn around. - Okay. Wait. - Okay. What's that? Hey! We, Miguhara... would like to emphasize our natural... Sorry. Can you turn on the lights if you're not using the projector. Of course... The results... show that... the addition of the new elements... allows our brand to stand out among the others. Right?! We've already extended our business abroad. It has led to positive results in revenue. It says here that you have KANG Jin-cheol in an Ad. - Is that sealed? - Sorry? The reports say he's missing. Actually, he's in Busan. Busan? His grandfather passed away. I was at the funeral. Ma'am. Will we have a signing with KANG Jin-cheol tomorrow? I just got a call from the department store. We will? Is this true? What? By tomorrow? We're so going in to the department store! By the way how did you meet him? Wait. The guy you met in the train... I'll call you later. Okay. - You have to call me! - Sure. Excuse me? My word... This is all because of you. Why is this because of me? You're the one that fell through. I wouldn't have if you stopped. At least you didn't lose your phone. I had a charm that my mother made for me in my wallet. Augh, I stink. THE RAINBOW DINER Great restaurant my ass. Wow. That's amazing! - Auntie, I'm here. - Me too. Long time no see. - How have you been? - You look so amazing. How about Jin-cheol? Jin-cheol? He just left. And you just let him? Did he say where he's going? Didn't his grandpa die? I guess he went there. Don't bother him. Anyways, why is this place so empty? Are you rubbing it in my face? - Auntie, give us some grub. - Of course. Seafood stew. So you changed your mind? No... I was hungry and I don't know my way around. So you weren't looking for me? No. So you were looking for me. No... Okay. We'll leave it at that. Hey. Don't think... Hello, I'm KANG Dong-won, this kid's colleague. Oh. Hello. So you didn't meet KANG Jin-cheol? Oh. Apparently he left. Apparently... Shoulder... So now what? Don't worry about it. I'll find him in no time. Oh wow. It really is you. Look who it is. Our little Song-e. - You look so pretty! - I've always been pretty. What took you so long? I've been caught up. This is my girlfriend. What? Is that so? No. It's not... No need to deny it. No, really. I'm not his... I guess your new girlfriend likes to play cool. She's pretty though, right? Who wasn't? All of your several girlfriends. Right? That little girl... Your skirt looks a little short, missy. So hot. Don't be ridiculous. You don't have to pay. That's my nephew. - No, I insist. - It's fine, I tell you! Auntie, you can't do this every time I visit you! It's fine. - Let me drop her off first. - Of course. Be back soon. Is she your real aunt? What do you think? Really? Oh, I didn't know... Bro, I'll be right back. - Aren't you crossing the line? - Huh? Introducing a girl you wanted to sleep with to your family. Did I bring you here? No. True... How many girls did you bring here? They were looking at me funny. Okay. So you're offended. I thought I was your type. Is that just a line you use? I just have a lot of types. Do they say yes to this crap? Lady. There are a lot of girls more open than you. And this is for the best of both of us. Did you think about the consequences? Lives could be at stake here. That's not my business. We're all adults here. Fine. Since this isn't my business either, let me tell you that your life disgusts me. Taxi! Busan station right? Right. Right. Well. I guess I have something to thank you for. Have a good life. Let's go together. Where? Busan station. That's it. I promise. You really have the nerve. My mind is set in stone. Don't worry. I gave up sleeping with you. That easily? Jae-hyun! I found Jin-cheol! Come quick! Hey! Jae-hyun! Why are you leaving me here?! Must you send Jin-cheol to the states? Of course. This is a lifetime opportunity. I know... But... he's different from you. How? Did he ever say that he wanted to go to the NBA? Who doesn't? His life depends on it. He's young... Jin-cheol enjoys the sport. He's not like you who craves to be the best. Give him some time. I'm sure he'll find you when he makes up his mind. Why do you carry that ball around? I gave it to Jin-cheol when he started basketball. He recently sent it back to me. I need to send him to the NBA. Do you know where he is? I have my guess. It's dangerous though. Are you in? Hello... - Jae... Jae... - He just... This way... Right. That yellow one. Go. Go! Don't let him cut you. Go around him. What are you doing? You're letting him go. Did he rob you or something? No, he's robbing you. He's the one paying for my ride. - You're broke? - Yup. Where's my phone? My phone! Stop! Stop! Are you sure about this? You can just wait here. I'm worried that he might disappear again. I can make it. Then... Let's. Are you looking at my ass? I'm not that kind of girl! Right. Right. Okay, call me if he calls. I'll call you back. Let's go. I don't think he's here either. I came here often with him. I'm not familiar with basketball... But NBA is a big thing? He's a bit weird. But I envy him. He can give up NBA for something that he's more fond of. Apparently it's some girl. Ridiculous right? Love could be the only possible reason. It's not easy to come by. That's being naive. Love is around every corner. Jae-hyun? Hey. Hi. Bo-Kyoung. Right, Bo-kyoung. You're so beautiful I didn't recognize you. What are you doing here? I'm here on a business trip. How are you these days? Classes are classes. Are you teaching high school senior again? I'm an aerobic instructor. Right, Bo-kyoung. I heard aerobics are the it-thing for high school seniors. Is that so? You haven't changed at all. No... Did I interrupt? No. Not at all. - Okay. I'll see you around. - Yeah... Around... She's not over me. Mom! Oh my darling. Are you awake now? You slept with her, right? Maybe. You even slept with your teacher, you can't remember? What? What now? Did you see how she glared at me. So it's you this time. You didn't catch the hidden message? What? This man is a beast in bed. You see those coins in the middle? Jin-cheol and I made most of them. Sure. I'm serious. I played ball too. I guess I play ball too. There you go. Saw that? Luck. You okay? It's cold. Soo-jung. Have a seat. I'm fine. - Just stay still. - Why? What? These are killing you, huh? - What are you doing? - They're swollen. Your feet. Stay still. Do your knees hurt? They twitch a bit. I guess I walked too much. This can get serious. I know what I'm talking about. I've kind of been through the same thing. Make sure you apply warm pressure on it. Don't wear high heels. Okay. Better? Yes. I'm good. It stopped raining. Shall we leave? - Here. Take this. - Thank you! Bye. I don't think we're going to find him today... To the station? We split everything fifty-fifty. So noone feels more pressured. Is that really necessary? So noone feels more pressured. - Split it in two. - Huh? Please. Just in case you forget. Soo-jung... Are you ner... What's the hurry? Huh? What happened to emotion? Can we talk before we... you know? Stop teasing me. I'm mustering up so much courage. Isn't this how it's supposed to happen? Okay. Okay. I got it. We're pretty high up. It's bothering me. Shall we? Who says that? Shall we? Soo-jung! Yes? Why this sudden change of mind? You don't have to tell me if you don't feel like it. Because you seem like a nice person. Me? How am I a nice person? Do you need to feel better about yourself? Who knows. Maybe this will become special. Alright. You're easy with women but know how to remain loyal. You know how to laugh with a child. Know your manners at a funeral. A nice person. Soo-jung! Yes? What now? You want to go for a walk? What? Why? Was it something I said? No, it's not that. Was it something I said? Soo-jung. I don't think this is right. Wow. This is so not it. Huh? Are you making fun of me? Now that I'm in? No, Soo-jung. I'm... Soo-jung. One-night stand. I must've been crazy. Excuse me, Soo-jung. It's a misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? I know you're mad. It's not what you think. I don't care. This was a one-night thing, wasn't it? I know... It's just... It doesn't feel right. Why? What are you saying? Where is the sleaze that I was with the whole day? What are you wearing? You were just too beautiful. What does that have to do with anything? That. That nonchalant behavior. Acting like you don't care but you really do. Crying at a funeral of a person that you haven't even met. Walking around in those ridiculous shoes. You think that's beautiful? I need to take you somewhere. Hey. It's you! You were really a basketball player. Are you okay? You drank a lot back there. And I thought you didn't drink at all. Me? Really? I can guess why. I'm not myself today. Here. Cheers! You see. How can you marry someone that you've only met or two months? Why can't I do that? Whoa. That's going a little too far. Is that so? Have you ever pictured yourself breaking up with him? I don't want to. I basically spent my entire youth with him. And now my high school sweetheart is marrying my friend. If he marries someone else, where does that put me? You don't erase everything when you break up with someone. That's just depressing. I know. But it's not that easy as it sounds. Ten years. A decade. That's quite some time together. Ten years, twenty years. That's not important. Just focus right now. This instant. That instant could be a lifetime for someone. Not just one day but everyday. What do you say. 1 on 1? What? Fine. I'll go first. What are we betting? One-night stand? Loser. One, two, three! No way. KIM Jae-hyun looks baffled. No way did that just happen. What are you doing with that. I'm going to dunk. Dunk? I've always wanted to try. Okay. Give me the ball. I feel dizzy. I'm going to make it today. Wow, that's awesome. You should try this too! It feels great! Did you let go? Huh? Did you let go of me? Are you okay? Why did you let go? Oh my god. Who is it? I don't know. Let's go. Hurry. Who left the lights on... Well... Do you hear that? What? Did you say something? You told me no one's coming! They should be at training. Wait a minute! Who's this? What are you doing? A trainee? Who's she? Do you know her? We met... A man's jacket! No... This is mine... it's dry now. Like men's wear... Wait... Wait! I guess we missed him altogether. Can I have your number so that I can send you his autograph...? How should we say goodbye? How do you want it to happen? Casual handshake? Or a big hug? Or just leave it like this. Soo-jung! Good bye. Goodbye, Jae-hyun. I was on my way to meet you in Seoul. Do you feel better? He had his years on him. But I'm sure he's at a better place. Bro. I'm not after the money. Money isn't the only reason. Isn't it though? For you? - For your company? - Jin-cheol. You can't throw away a lifetime opportunity for a girl. Are you serious? Bro. It's not just any girl. She's the one. You know that I couldn't have made it this far without her. Jin-cheol... I'll go after a few years. I know you've helped me with my career, but I need to make my own decisions now. We're leaving. Goodbye. We're off. - Sure. Good work today. - Thanks. Are you busy? It was okay. When are you done? Do you need your laptop? Jin-cheol's staying in Korea. That isn't your decision to make! What if he hurts himself? Are you going to take responsibility? What if he turns out like you? Give me his contract. I got rid of it. Why are you suddenly acting like a martyr now? I never sold someone out. Jae-hyun. KIM Jae-hyun. We've been together for ten years. I know. What kind of girlfriend was I to you? What's with you? For ten years... What was I to you? What? Let's end it. I just said that, right? I thought it over so many times. I'm sure you did, right? Yeah. Let's end things. We're over. Let's not pretend that things are okay. We know it's not true. We've had a go but we know that it's over now. Say something. If it's thank you, just shut it. Bro! I heard you left the company. Word travels that fast. I'm here to sign with you. 'Follow your beginnings in times of turmoil.' Bro, I'm still the best out there. And you know I can't survive without you! Please, bro. Please. Here. Here. What's this? Don't ask, kiddo. I'm here to see BAE Soo-jung. She just left. Did you try her cell? No. I didn't. - Can you hand this to her? - Of course. Can I borrow something to write on? You really broke up? Yup... What did you say? What are you saying? I just want to know what people say when they break up after ten years. We didn't say much. Whatever. It took you a while but you made the right decision. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. What about that guy. Do you keep in touch? Nope. Why? It wasn't good? It was. Then? Well... You can't get over him, huh? - No... - No, my ass. You can't get over him even though we all know that he's not even thinking about you. And it's driving you crazy. It's not like that. Call him. You can sleep with anyone you want now. Shut it. It was a one-night thing. That was it. Wow. You're so cool about it. So you're done with him? I don't really remember him. It was nothing. I guess this is who I am. You go, girl. Now that you're single, you should sleep around here and there. Maybe I will. It wasn't such a big deal either. I can finally call you a friend now, Soo-jung. What are you doing here? I had some business to take care of. Am I that business? You are. Just that. What is it? How about tonight? I guess it doesn't have to be just one night. What? You and me. It doesn't have to be serious. We're pretty much alike. What do you mean? Want me to reiterate? I didn't know this was your true motive. I guess I was wrong. I'm leaving. Do you know me? We've only been together for a day. Right. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I thank you for politely explaining this to me in person. Okay. Just neglect everything in your life. Let me help you out. Ma'am! KANG Jin-cheol just asked our ad schedule! We're in the department store! And this was dropped off for you. I'm leaving early today. ADVERTISING AGREEMENT KANG Jin-cheol Bro! I know. I know that... I'm acting weird. You haven't been your usual self these past few days. It's driving me crazy to the point where I can't function but I can't stop thinking about... Who? Jin-cheol? You're a great bro. What... that girl? Jae-hyun is obsessing over a girl? Is this all happening in my dream? What a surprise! You need to sulk at your own place. That day... was probably the strangest day of my life. I got hit with a ball in the morning. Those red shoes I hardly ever wore. Yoon-joo announcing her marriage, the man in the train, what happened that night. It was a strange day. Like it was destiny. Then go grab it. Grab him. I did. But I screwed it up. Because I was afraid I might get hurt. Are you okay? I'm so stupid right? Right? I'm so stupid. So so stupid... - Morning. Coffee? - Sure. You finally bought a new laptop? Yup. You were so attached to it. I backed up those memories to here. Something wrong? No. Not a thing. Good job. Ma'am. Your boyfriend is to die for. Boyfriend? CEO KIM will donate advertising revenue to youth basketball club I'm really sorry but I sneaked a peek at the note. Note? I was so touched by his words that I told him you were at the cafe. May one become many. Wait. Hey, man. Is it over? Yup. It's over. Are you coming here? The game's about to finish. I'm heading to Chicago, remember? Isn't it a night flight? People think you're handing out the scholarship today. You take care of it. I need to stop by another place. You should come. You'll regret it. What's going on? Well... That, Miguhara is here too. Never mind. Have a safe trip. Sorry. I really need this. - What... - Sorry. Ma'am... Jae-hyun. - Yes? - Where's Jae-hyun? Excuse me. My apologies, sir. It's fine. Follow your beginnings in times of turmoil... -KIM Jae-hyun I was lying in the cafe. I wasn't myself. You came here to tell me that? I am... sleeping with you tonight. Excuse me... Excuse... Me... Is she okay? You know her? No... Let's go! Experience the luck of my life, huh? My ass... Excuse me... Sorry... Excuse me? I'm thinking of sleeping with you tonight.
