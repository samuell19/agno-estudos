[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] oh... [gasping] [laughing] I've got that wreath that you liked, the one for the windows. Oh, it's perfect! I'm going to take two. Three. Let me see what I've got. Okay. I found them. Oh... Okay. I'm going to take one more. Thank you. -There you go. -Oh... Okay. Here you go. Merry Christmas. -Bye! -Merry Christmas. Whoa... You might want to slow your roll. I've waited long enough. It's December. If you keep up this pace, there'll be no room for the customers. It's my first Christmas without my mom. Decorating is how I cheer myself up. She was the heart and soul of this place. You're gonna do fine. Just give yourself some time. Ease up on the decorating in the meantime. It's turning into santa's village. What? You look so much like your mom sometimes. Really? Even though I'm adopted? It's in your expression. The smile. Sometimes I look in the mirror, trying so hard to see her in me. Oh, she's right there... Not in the mirror, in who you are. Thank you. Hmm. One penne arrabiata! One mamma's lasagne! How did you like that olive oil? It was great. Order some more. Mr. Moretti likes extra sauce. Okay, coming up. You know, nobody talks to a busboy or leaves them a tip, but he always does. Give the morettis some struffoli for dessert, on the house. Here's the penne. Mr. And mrs. Moretti! I wanted to say good night. You're just like your mother. Sophia was always in her apron. The struffoli... -Oh. -So good. I hope you'll both come to my Christmas eve dinner. Oh... We wouldn't miss it for the world, eh? You have done Sophia proud. I hope so. Ciao, Bella. Ciao. I put an offer on a house. Oh, I hope you get it. It's my Christmas wish. Stockings hung from my own mantle, and a mortgage, and house insurance, and repairs... Oh, careful what you wish for. You have a Christmas wish? Oh... The holidays are going to be pretty lonely without any family this year, so... I guess... That would be my wish. Some people to love. Oh... Lots of people love you, including me. I get the results of my DNA test this week. I mean, I could... I could be related to... Armani, or versace, or I could have this big family with a villa in Tuscany. Do I get a room? [phone buzzing] oh... I always get so excited just thinking it's the results. Oh... We gotta get back to the restaurant. -Oh... -Now. Look. Oh... [water dripping] you're gonna have to replace the pipes and bring them up to code. There is some water damage, but I won't know how much until I get a better look. How long is it going to take to do these repairs? Two or three weeks. We have to close down that long? Unless you want to pass out umbrellas with each meal. Eddie... You gotta promise me that you are gonna be done by Christmas eve. I am making the feast of the seven fishes. It is the first time that I am doing this on my own, and this means more to me than anything else, especially now. Promise? Promise. [record playing] ♪ snow is gently falling ♪ ♪ on the ground ♪ ♪ angel voices sing for miles around... ♪ aw, we got a Christmas card from the morettis. Aw... Yeah. I called the insurance company, and I sent them eddie's invoice. It's very strange being out of the kitchen. I don't know what to do with myself. Try to resist the urge to decorate. I capped off a lonely dinner with two more lawn ornaments. I mean, what are you going to do when you end a four-year engagement with a phone call, and then you lose your mom, who was your north star? I think a couple of reindeer seem appropriate. They certainly do. They're very cute. [computer alert chimes] [gasping] the results for my DNA test are in! Okay, well, go to the website and see what it says. Okay, okay, wait. Just... Just give me a minute. Okay. Okay, here we go. It says that I am 50% Jewish! -Amazing! -Wow. I did not see that coming. No. I guess the tenors and the villas are off the table. Okay. Hmm. Walking is always a good idea. You can process your unexpected heritage, and I can get in my 10,000 steps... Or 100 steps, whatever. I don't know anything about being Jewish, and now I find out it's 50% of who I am. Well, your timing couldn't be better. Hanukkah starts next week. But I'm all about Christmas. And now I have to learn a whole other holiday and all the traditions, and I'm guessing it probably doesn't involve lawn ornaments. But maybe some family. Let's go find out. It says that I have nine DNA matches! [gasping] I am so happy for you, and for them. Whoever they are, wherever they are, they're my blood relatives. And it says that I have someone in the "close family" category... Ah. What does that mean? I don't know. They could be a first cousin... [gasps] I just got an email from one of my DNA matches! Okay. Here we go. Okay. It's from Becky Berman. She wants to meet. She lives in shaker heights! That's, like, ten miles away. What if she doesn't like me? [laughing] you're very hard not to like. [entry bells jingle] hi. Christina? Yes. Hello. I'm Becky. Hi... I am so happy you're here. It's so nice to meet you. Can I get you anything? No, no, I'm fine, thank you. Come! Sit. Okay. Okay. This is just kind of a big deal for me. Me too. Yeah, I'm just a little nervous. Me too. You're the first DNA match I actually got to meet. Oh... Yeah, I wonder how many of us are out there. I don't know. I was, um, I was adopted by a single mother as an infant, so I really don't know any of my biological family. Well, you've got me now. Yup. -And my two kids. -Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, and this guy. -Hi. -Hi. This is my brother, Scott. -Hello. Nice to meet you. -Pleased to meet you. Uh, Becky tells me we're related. -Yeah. -Well, the question is how. I mean, it says we're close family, possibly cousins. It's going to be so much fun to figure out. Well, it's got to be from dad's side. I mean, there's tons of relatives. And I actually think that we have more in common than our genes, 'cause I have a restaurant, too. No way. -That's amazing. -Yeah. -What kind of restaurant? -Italian. -Ah. My favorite. -Ooh. -Yes? -Yeah! -I'll cook for you. -Please. For you and your kids. [laughing] Scott... Hey, guys. -Hey. -I don't have much time. I'm on a deadline. David, this is Christina. Hello. She's a DNA match I found online. Well, that's great. Yea. Are you another relative? [chuckling] no, no, just an old family friend. I'll get those latkes ready for you to try. This was so good. Good. I'm so glad you enjoyed it. We're doing a special Hanukkah menu. Oh. David is a food critic. We like to get his opinion before we serve anything new. Oh, a food critic? Yeah. David singer. He's pretty well-known. I know the name. Well, it's nice to know that people are reading what I write. Yeah, I've read every single word. -Really? -Yeah. Christina has a restaurant, too. Dolce Angelo, in Cleveland. You just... You wrote a review, and you just said the food was predictable. Well, I also said it was very good. I just wanted to be a little bit more surprised. Yeah, yeah, totally. Faint praise. I'm going to go check on those latkes. -Okay. -It was so nice meeting you. Yeah, you too. He's really nice. -Yeah. -Yeah. All right, so for Hanukkah, we're doing eight crazy latkes. Uh, so, we've got the holy guacalatke, and we've also added the whole enchilatke. Uh-huh. I want you to try this one first. -Okay. -So, go ahead. Tell me what you think. It's good. Yeah? Try adding a little pico de Gallo. Pico de Gallo. Not just a shayna punim. Yeah. Yeah. Like, what's the deal, what's the family dynamic? You know what, I love them... I don't got any pico, but I got some hot sauce. Let's do it. Lenny was my dad. He passed away a few years ago. Sports and food were his two favorite things, so he found a way to combine them. Same with me. My mom, she passed away, um, and then now I'm running the restaurant that I grew up in, so... I... I just can't believe how much we have in common. I know, it's... It's crazy. My mom's in st. Louis, but she gets back tomorrow. I hope she can fill in the blanks about how we're related. Mm-hmm. Hey, why don't you come to brunch? Only if I can bring dessert. My mom will be thrilled to meet another member of the family. Hi, mom! Hey. There are only four days till Hanukkah, and I... I have so much to do. That's a really nice one, mom. Yes, I got it from a collector in st. Louis. It looks just like one that my grandmother gave me when I was a child. Well, who knows, maybe it's the same one. That's what I told Leslie, the collector, yes, to explain why I was crying over a dreidel. I invited someone to brunch I met on one of those ancestry sites. Oh, today? Yeah, I hope it's okay. Christina lost her mom recently. She was a chef, and so is Christina. Now she's running their restaurant on her own, just like me and Scott. Well, I look forward to meeting her. Are the kids going to be here? No, no, Phil took molly to ballet class and max to hockey practice. All right, well, come on, help me get the food ready. Okay, of course. Hi. What are you doing here? Staying here over the holidays. -Oh. -Is that going to be a problem? Not a problem. 'cause I could eat in my room. Let's not make it a thing. Fine by me. Good. Great. I brought... Cannolis. Okay. Mm-hmm. They are for dessert. They are not for review. If the cannolis are predictable, I'll keep it to myself. Hmm. You might even like them. This is my mom, Ruth. Oh, so nice to meet you. Hi. I made cannolis. You made these yourself? Yeah, just an old family recipe. Oh, yeah. Becky told me your mom was a chef. Yeah. Yeah. And this place, it's beautiful. Aw, thank you. We're getting ready for Hanukkah. It's my favorite time of the year. I hope you're hungry. -Yes. -I am. He eats enough for an army and never gains weight. It isn't fair. I run five miles a day. Yeah, and I run after two kids. And you'd never guess how close they are. Uh, do you have any brothers or sisters? No, it's just me. Well, if you're going to meet relatives online, you couldn't do better than this family. -Thanks, David. -Shucks. Stop it. Well, let's see how she feels after brunch. -You just did. Yes, you did. -Did I? So, uh... So Becky tells me that you and David have a history. Oh, yes, a short one, about half a page. This guy wrote that, uh, my lasagna was predictable. -No. -David... Did you really say that? I... I... Honestly, I can't remember. -[laughing] -I don't remember. David's on his way to Europe... Yep, to, uh, try great food and write about it. Aw, I want your life. Well, I'm leaving on the first, so I'm kind of camping out here until I take off... Which is lucky for me, because Ruth is one of my favorite cooks. Aw. Yes, David grew up around this table. His folks and our family, we celebrated every holiday together until they moved away. Every Hanukkah that I can remember. Lenny and my dad were best friends. Yeah, david's like family. Well, Christina really is family, according to her DNA results. We just need to figure out the connection. Hmm. Um, I was adopted, so I have no information. Where did you grow up? Uh, here in Cleveland. Where were you born? Uh, Fairview hospital. Yeah. When's your birthday? November 24th. I was born on thanksgiving day, if you can believe it. No way. You were born on that holiday as well? No, I... [voices fade] well, my mom... [♪♪♪] excuse me. Well, thanks for sharing the story with us. It was amazing. This looks so good. Ma, are you okay? Yeah. Is it... Is it about dad? Sometimes, mom really misses him. I always miss him, but that isn't what's wrong. What is it? This isn't the time or place. The time or the place for what? Just give me a second. When I was in college, I, um... I was an exchange student in Italy, and I fell in love, and we got married much too young, and it didn't work out, so we had it annulled, and when I got back to the states, I found out I was pregnant, and... Christina... I'm... I'm your biological mother. Uh, you were married to someone else? Yeah, it was many years before dad, and... And for just a short time. How could we not know about this? Oh, my goodness. This means you're my half-sister. There's so much I want to tell you. I can't. I'm sorry. No, I'm here whenever you're ready. I think this is... Just about all I can handle right now. I'm sorry. [knocking] are you okay to drive? Can I give you a lift? I'm fine. You don't seem fine. I don't know what I am. I'm sorry, I just... I have to go. Okay. Is she all right? She'll be fine. I don't even know her, and... I already love her. We're making really good progress. I'll have to move the lighting fixture in the ceiling, but don't worry. I'll have it done by your Christmas eve dinner, -I promise. -Wonderful. Would you like to come to our Christmas dinner? It's mostly the staff and their families, and the morettis. They were really close to Sophia. We have a really good time. Yeah, sure, that'd be great. Okay. [laughing] so, what happened? How was your brunch yesterday? I just met my biological mother. Ruth. She is becky's mom. Wow. Wow, right? Becky just sent me a text. Ruth sent me an email. I don't know how to respond. I mean, I'm very conflicted. Sophia is my mother. It's not like I'm going to turn around and just replace her with somebody new. Oh, it's doesn't have to be one or the other. I mean, you can have them both. We don't have any history, or shared memories. You'll make new memories. Well, yesterday is definitely a memory that I am never going to forget. There's just so much about this I still don't get. [sighing] I'm sure. I... It is so important to me to help you try to understand. I was really lost... For so many years, just... Constantly wondering if I'd done the right thing. And then I had the great good fortune of meeting your dad, who was just... ...He was just the kindest, most wonderful man. Did dad know? Oh, yes, of course. He... But he wanted me to be the one to tell you. Well, you should have. I know. There were so many times I wanted to tell you, and then... And then the older you got, the harder it got. They say timing is everything, but whatever the right time was, I must have missed it. Hey. You know, maybe this was the right time. Thank you. On the upside, I get a sister who I really like. And I found her first. Okay, you've known her for, like, two minutes longer than me. Oh, come on, Scott. You have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you two squabble. So, I was thinking we could add another one or two tables by the window. Mm... I like it the way it is. Why does it have to change? Okay. It was just a thought. When I look around the restaurant, all I see is my mom... And I just want to hold on to that for as long as I can. [entry bells jingle] okay. Hi. Janet, meet David singer. The David singer that didn't like your lasagna? Yes. Mm-hmm. This is a lot of Christmas. You have a problem with that? No, no, it looks nice. -Meaning "overdone"? -"nice" meaning I like it. Why are you here? Ruth was worried about you. Ah. And also, I had a meeting with my editor, so I told her I'd stop by. I'm just... I'm trying to figure it all out. She also told me to try the lasagna and be nice about it. Uh-huh. Not a review, just unofficially. We're closed for repairs, so... But that doesn't mean you can't cook. Why don't you whip up some lasagna and try and change his mind? I... Could... Do that. Sounds great. Did you know that lasagna originated in ancient Greece? It's Italian to me. This is really good. It's not as forgettable as you remember? [chuckling] your review came out a few weeks after my mom passed away. -I'm so sorry. -You weren't wrong. I wasn't at my best, in the kitchen or anywhere else. Sometimes, I can go a little too far. You know, I get a little too passionate about food. Where did you discover your passion? I worked for my dad in the restaurant supply business. I'd sample the food, and I began to develop some pretty strong opinions. And how do you know so much about lasagna and ancient Greece? Who rattles off these things? I travel a lot. Sort of a... Culinary wanderer, and I fell in love with cross-cultural cooking. I'm actually planning to write a book about it. Good for you. I haven't written it yet. I keep getting distracted. Critics can be very critical of their own work. Yeah. I gave Eddie some of your lasagna. He is in heaven. -Um... -What? I have to go. But Lorenzo is delivering the statue any minute. I know, and I hate to miss the unveiling, but I have my niece's ballet recital. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. See you guys later. It's a statue? Yeah, my mom, she always wanted a statue of an angel in the courtyard, and today I'm fulfilling her wish, just in time for Christmas. Well, you got me beat there. The best gift I ever gave my mom was a golf cart, which had battery problems, then she gave up golf... A statue would've been much better. You're funny. -Oh. -Cheers. Cheers. To passion. Wow. It's everything... And so much more. She'll watch over you. Lorenzo, thank you. Take good care of her. -I will. -[chuckling] I think he means the angel. I would say Lorenzo nailed it. He did. Anyway, I should get going. David... Thank you. I think you should call Ruth. It's not an easy call for me to make. I mean, finding out you have another mother... It's very complicated for me. She has the biggest heart of anyone I know. I'm just saying. And now I will say goodbye. Ciao. Arrivederci. [laughing] did you know I can say goodbye in 40 different languages? Okay, bye. Okay. I'm outta here. [laughing] [♪♪♪] ♪ snow is gently falling ♪ ♪ on the ground ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ angel voices sing for miles around ♪ hello, Ruth? It's Christina. I'm nervous. I am, too. Now that we know who we are to each other. Yeah. There's so much I want to say, and I don't even know where to begin. I was... I was 19 when I met your father. He was Italian... My... My mom, my adoptive mom, Sophia, she was Italian. Oh. I've always felt Italian at heart. Oh, well... I'm not surprised, yeah. Giorgio, your father, was, uh... He was in the Italian army, and his parents were opposed to the marriage. They were very set in their ways, and so... When I found out I was pregnant, I... I tried to reach him, but he had been deployed, and there was... There was no internet then, and no emails, and my letters were returned, and... I never did contact him. But I was very young, and I knew that I was not capable of raising a child on my own... So I gave you up for adoption. But I never, I never stopped thinking about you, and I never... I always wondered where you were, and... -It's okay. -...And how you were... It's okay. ...What your life was like. My... My mom... She wasn't married, she really wanted a child, and so she adopted... And I was very happy... ...And I was so loved. It means so much to hear you say that. I'm glad I'm here. Me too. And I think that I like decorating as much as you. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to come to the first night of Hanukkah? It's... It's Thursday, and you could meet other family members and get to know some of our traditions, and... Yes, I would like to come. Thank you for letting me into your life. Thank you. It's okay. Hey. Hi. [he chuckles] you talked to Ruth. I did. How did it go? -It... -that's okay. You know what? It's between you and her. It went really well. I'm coming to the first night of Hanukkah. That's great! Okay, I should... All right. See you around? Yeah. You will. 'kay, I... I should get going. Yeah, and I have a review to write. I think one of us has to... -yup. -Yeah. Arrivederci. Au revoir! Sayonara! Aloha! Adjö! Oh, my goodness. Adios! Namaste! Ciao! Sampai jumpa! [♪♪♪] -hi. -Hi. [gasping] -christina... -Hi. Oh, you look so lovely. Thank you. Happy hanukkah. Thank you. -This is for you. -Oh, thank you so much. -Happy hanukkah, sis. -Oh, hello. Hi. -Let me take your coat. -Hi. Okay. Thank you. That's very nice of both of you. Thank you. Okay, come in already, and meet everyone. They can't wait to meet you. Come on, come on, come on! This is my sister, christina, you guys. Hello. Hi, I'm phil. Hello, phil. Your brother-in-law. And these are our kids, your nephew, max... Hi... Hi. And your niece, molly. Hi. It's so wonderful to meet you. It's so wonderful to meet you, too. My fiancée, sarah, is spending the holidays with her family in london, but she's really excited to meet you. I'm gonna be a flower girl at the wedding. Are you going to come? Uh... Of course she is. She's part of the family now. Here, come on, come on, let's go sit in the living room. Let's go. I'm so happy we're all here together. Ma, this brisket smells amazing. I know, it's... It's almost done. It's almost ready. Now, this is called the shamash. The menorah has eight branches. Each candle represents one of the eight nights that the miracle that is hanukkah lasted. Tonight is the first night, so we only light the first candle. Thank you very much. ♪ barukh atah adonai ♪ ♪ eloheinu melekh ha'olam ♪ ♪ asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav ♪ ♪ v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner ♪ ♪ shel hanukkah ♪ ♪ barukh atah adonai ♪ ♪ eloheinu melekh ha'olam ♪ ruth, this smells so good. I mean, you have just outdone yourself this year. Wow, and this from a professional critic. Well, tonight, I am just a grateful guest. So how come you're staying here? My sublet sold. I'm heading to europe after the first. Besides, when his parents moved to san diego, I said I would keep an eye on him, and no one should spend the holidays alone. Well, david, I think it's time you settle down, get a place of your own, maybe have some kids. Did either of you happen to see any presents near the menorah? Oh! Oh, wow. Lucky you! They're off. Seriously, david, when you're ready to buy, give me a call. Okay. He's a real estate broker with a one-track mind. But I love him. Oh, this looks like the best brisket ever. You say that every year. Well, it does. It looks so good. So do the latkes. Well, frying latkes in oil is a tradition. In the temple, they only had enough oil to light the lamp for one night, but it lasted eight days. That's how come it's a miracle. The miracle of the oil. Wow. You guys are very smart. Uh, hey, sis, could you grab the kugel? -Which one is the kugel? -I've got it. [laughter] uh, maybe the challah, then? I don't know what the challah is! I have so much to learn! Just take the whole bread board and follow me. Okay, here we go. What is it? Oh... Aw! I told you. What did I tell you? It's my turn. Wow, this is quite the collection. Well, as my mother used to say, "why do when you can overdo?" oh, that one... That one I got on a river cruise when lenny and I went to austria, and this one, this one is actually over a hundred years old. It's beautiful. You know, there are letters on each of the sides of the dreidel, and together they mean "a great miracle happened there." oh... Oh, this is when we took the kids fishing. Oh, springfield lake. Mm. I caught a catfish. I caught a shoe. Oh, and that's my lenny. With max. Aw. I miss him dearly. This is your grandmother, rachel. You have the same eyes. She had green eyes, like we do. So, what do you think of hanukkah? It's pretty great. And it's only the first night. Yeah. Would... Would you guys like to come to my house for the last night of hanukkah? I can't think of anything I'd like more. [entry bells jingle] hi. Hello. So I'm finally outlining my new book, and I thought about you. Really, about a woman who doesn't know from kugel? [laughing] that's my next book. What's this one called? It's called "the cultural heritage of tradition and food in the mediterranean." well, that's catchy. I look forward to reading it. You inspired me to do more research on the jewish influence of italian food. Okay. Take artichoke, for instance. -Artichokes? -Yeah. Well, the way you prepare it... -Yeah? -Uh, fried in oil. It's called "carciofi alla giudia." yeah, I know what that is. No, I just don't... that might... no. My customers aren't expecting this. Exactly. Maybe you could try it. No, thank you. I really, really, really don't need any more of your menu suggestions. Okay? I'm going to get back to work. I'm sorry. I just... You know, everything about this place is just tied to my mother, so, just... It just hits a raw nerve. Forget everything I just said. Honestly, it was just an excuse to see you. Pretense has never been my strong suit. No, it really needs work. Next time I show up, I am going to leave the artichokes out of it. I'm on my way to get a christmas tree, if... Do you mind if I tag along? I mean, if I'm going to write this book, I need to know all about christmas and the traditions. Okay, but I expect a very flattering "thank you" in your book. "my deepest appreciation to the unpredictable, unforgettable christina rossi." that'll do. You sure you have enough lawn ornaments? You're critiquing my christmas decorations? [chuckling] [groaning] [groaning] okay. [straining to lift] ah. Only you would have reindeer lighting the way to your hanukkah dinner. You see a contradiction in that? In the best possible way. Let's get this tree inside. -Okay. -Okay. [turning record player down] some of these ornaments are older than me. This one, this one's italian. "buon natale." that's "merry christmas." who's this? Ooh, that is babbo natale. That's the italian santa. Ah. Wow. My life is on this tree. And my mom's. Mothers pass along their childhoods. And their taste in music. Yeah, who is this? What? This... This... This is lou monte! Oh, right. I think I have his hanukkah album. I grew up listening to my mom's christmas record collection. Connie francis, perry como, but my favorite was always lou monte. I would just listen to his recording of "dominick the donkey" all the time. Strangely, I'm not familiar with that one. Lou and I do a really great duet. Oh, I'm sure it's just great. Yeah. So, this is christmas. Yeah, what do you think? I understand why you don't want it to end. Yeah. I do not know what to get christina. Oh, I don't either. I mean, she's... She's my daughter, she's your sister. There's so much I don't know about her. And what do we put on the card? Is this for hanukkah or for christmas? Both, I guess. [gasping] what about a watch? No, no, no, no. It should be more personal. Well, like what? I don't have a clue. Maybe you should ask david. Scott told me that david told him that he and christina have been hanging out. Oh, I had... I had a hunch about those two. Well, both of them are single. She did mention an ex named roger, but that sounded very over. Hmm... Oh, no. I know that look. Don't you start meddling. Me? Meddle? Never. Mom... This is very exciting. [gasping] here it is. Hello. I used to walk by this stall all the time, and now it's my new favorite shop. What do you think? It would look good on my mantle. I think he's... Adorable. Thank you. I just love coming here. You can find so many treasures. I come here for the food. The best dumplings in the city are right around the corner. Mm. "la petite chinese." a fusion of french and chinese cuisine. Two orders of your dumplings du jour. Absolutely. Because of your review, we bought a brand-new food truck. [gasping] what? You give good reviews? Oh, ho, ho, ho. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Yes. Do you do any cooking, or you just write about people that do? [chuckling] I make a pretty mean noodle kugel. Want to show me how it's done? Of course. Actually, I used to make kugel with my dad. Not the best cook, but he's a really good guy. I don't know anything about my dad. I think about him all the time. Maybe you'll meet him someday. Yeah. Hey, it's time. -Ready? -All right. Perfect. Perfect. -Okay. -One... Two... -[cookies cracking] -three! [laughing] okay. Um, "those who sit in judgment have a fear of being judged." "you don't have to let go of the old to embrace the new." okay, I think fate got us confused. [laughing] I like that our futures overlap. Oh, good, you're here. I want to talk to you about christina. Okay. Yeah. It's important. Okay. I understand you have been spending a lot of time together. That's right. So I want to get her a gift, and I have no idea what she'd like. I thought you were going to ask me my intentions regarding your daughter. [laughing] well, well, now that you've brought it up, what... What are your intentions? Just to spend some time together. There's something I find so endearing about her. Mm, good. As to my other question about a gift, do you have any idea? I want to get her something really special, and I feel like I'm making up for so much lost time. I know she's really curious about her father. Do you have any pictures of him that you could give to her? I do, but... I have no idea where it is... But that's a really good idea. Do you have any way of reaching him? Mm... After all this time, I don't know. I... I wouldn't even know where to begin. What if we could find him? What if christina could talk to her father? And then if they wanted to, they could take it from there. You sure you're okay with that? Oh, I... I want whatever's going to make her happy. I want to give her a hanukkah-christmas gift that she'll always remember. I still have to get something for my dad and my nephew. Well, my shopping list just got a lot longer, 'cause I have to shop for my whole new family. Becky said that they exchange gifts on the last night of hanukkah, so I have to figure out what to get everybody, and I just want it to be perfect. Oh, don't put so much pressure on yourself. Just enjoy it. Yeah. It's funny to care so much about people that you just met. I mean, I don't really know how to feel. I'm sort of torn between really missing my mom and wanting to be close to these people, and now I just... I even feel guilty about just saying it out loud. You're allowed to be happy. Well, becky is easy to shop for and please. I have no idea what to get scott. And what about ruth? Oh, talk about loaded. Shopping for your other mother. Well, I'm sure she's gonna love anything that you get her. And I guess I should get something for david. But talk about hard to shop for. He is so opinionated. He certainly has a good opinion about you. He's coming over this afternoon, and we are making noodle kugel. Oh... How romantic. Okay, what's wrong with this picture? I just made noodle kugel while wearing a santa claus apron, listening to christmas music. The hanukkah aprons that I ordered haven't arrived yet. You know, it's kind of interesting, straddling two holidays. Welcome to my world. [he chuckles] this is so good. You know, kugel's just as popular in Italy as it is in brooklyn. It's a truly international dish. Well, you should put that in your book. I started writing my first chapter. That's so great. Then I rewrote it and rewrote it. Turns out I did more deleting than writing. Well, what do you think is... Holding you back? The fact that I'm only good for a thousand words. Reviews don't require a great deal of talent. It's funny, I've never admitted that to anyone... Not even myself. You should make it more personal, and less factual. You're funny, and you're... You're off the cuff. Show that. "kugels I've known and loved." there you go. Who wouldn't want to read that? -Hey, you know what? -What? We should get going. Where are we going? It's a surprise. Okay. Am I dressed okay? We might want to lose the aprons. Okay. I don't suppose you want to tell me where we're going. Aw, what would be the fun in that? Just a little clue. Okay, it's something I do every year. You are impossible. [he laughs] oh... The festival of lights. It's beautiful. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. [family chatting] [gasping] -hi! -[all exclaiming] chag sameach! Happy hanukkah! Shalom! -Hi! -Oh, hello. Oh, this is the best. Look at you! Hello! We're so happy you're here. It's so nice to see you. ♪ maoz tzur y'shuati... ♪ it's the fourth night of hanukkah, so we light four candles. The menorah is the symbol of hanukkah. It's the miracle of light over darkness, good over evil. We might each be a single light, but together, we are a powerful voice. ♪ ♪ v'sham todah n'zabeach ♪ ♪ l'eit tachin matbeach mitzar hamnabeach ♪ ♪ az egmor b'shir mizmor chanukat hamizbeach ♪ -that's nice. -Yes. -That's great. I'm glad you guys made it out. So, christina, would you like to come for brunch tomorrow? We could build a snowman! Yeah. I will bring bagels and lox. What do you say? You had me at "snowman"! [laughter] okay, so we'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. -Good night! -Good night! Good night, christina. They make a really nice couple. They haven't even been on a date yet. Scott, what do you call tonight? Very promising. One, two... wait! How's he gonna smile without a face? Oh! I left it in the house. Give me a minute. I'm gonna... I'm gonna come with you. Okay. Hang on. I thought we were going with ernie banks this year. Nah, becky wanted gretzky. Ah, there they are. A carrot for the nose, and buttons for his eyes. And, of course, licorice for the smile. You must think we're nuts with all the sports stuff. I think it's wonderful. Yeah? We're still huge cubs fans. That's how we keep my dad alive. Well, at least that's what it is for me. That same with me, for my mom, the mom who adopted me. Every recipe, every tradition, every song... I really like getting to know you. Oh... This is what it must be like to have a sister. Yeah. So phil says I always go overboard, which I probably do, but I'm really happy I found you. I think "overboard" runs in our genes. You have no idea. We took the kids to a basketball game once, and they were watching their mom instead of the court. I don't think I sat down once. I was hoarse from all the cheering. -I do the same thing. -No. With cooking competition shows. I'm just... I'm yelling, and I'm so intense, and aah! Go, go, go! Let's go give this snowman a face. Okay. All right, now, funny faces! Great. Ruth, let me get one of you and your family. Okay. You should see your face right now. What would I see? A mother's smile. Well, you're pretty smiley yourself, mister. She's good for you. Okay, a family. Come on. Okay. Family. Okay. Oh, yes! No, no, no, no, no! You're part of this family now. Get over here. Okay, here we go, guys. One, two, three. One more. One, two, three. Hot chocolate! -Hot chocolate! -Okay, okay. -One more. -Okay. [♪♪♪] it's kinda cool having a christmas tree inside a restaurant. It's a nice touch. My mom always said it made it feel more like a home. Your mom was right. Now all we have are the lights. Would you care to do the honors? Yes, my pleasure. Okay. One... Two... Three! Yay! That is a very pretty tree. Oh... No. I'm guessing that wasn't supposed to happen. No. Okay, eddie, thanks. Thanks a lot. Have a good night. [beeping call off] so, eddie called his friend who works for the city, and he said that the power went out all over the block, but it should be back on tomorrow morning. So your christmas eve dinner will not be in the dark. Apparently not. You know, you didn't need this elaborate ploy. If you wanted to hold my hand, all you had to do was ask. Good to know. You should have blackouts more often. This is really nice. I had to empty out the fridge. I didn't want it to go to waste. Oh. Do you know as much about wine as you do about food? I know what I like. I definitely put more stock in taste than price. Yeah. What's the best bottle of wine you've ever had? My parents gave me a bottle of chateau jean-marc for my 21st birthday. They bought it when I was born, and they let it mature as I did. Are you close with your parents? I am. But, you know what, they're in san diego, and I'm here, and I'm not really even here. I no longer have an address, and I'm about to spend some time abroad. Where are you going to go? Mostly the mediterranean. Oh. Yeah, I got a job to write a series of reviews, then I'm going to do some research for my book. I... Love to travel. Yeah. I can see that. My dad lived a typical 9-to-5 life, and I tried it on for size, and realized it wasn't for me. I wanted something less predictable. That seems to be a theme of yours. I wanted you to know who I am, christina. Thank you for your honesty. You know, you seem to bring that out in me. Um... I wish you the greatest success on your trip, and I hope it's full of surprises. You surprise me. Buon natale. Hanukkah sameach. [clinking glasses] [chopping] I'm so happy you called. I'm a chef. I want to get it right. Well, making latkes is... It's actually pretty simple. It's just potato, onion, matzoh meal, with a bit of egg to hold it all together. And I think I just wanted us to make them together. Well, it's a time-honored tradition, making latkes with your daughter, just... Just like I made them with my mom. Is it okay to use olive oil? Is that too heavy? No, no, no, olive oil's fine. Okay. I'm emotional by nature, but this is the onions. I always blame the onions. [laughing] so, what's the good news? A friend of mine in sicily came through. I have a phone number for giorgio. On behalf of my sister, well done. I just wanted you guys to know. Giorgio... I wonder what he's like. He's christina's father. That's all that really matters. Yeah. Have you told our mom? Not yet. She's with christina, making latkes. Oh, speaking of latkes... I tried to talk him out of it... "eight crazy latkes" is doing really well, so I was thinking of adding another one. What do you think of... [imitating drumroll] the chocolatke! I think you've gone a latke too far. -Wh... -mm-hmm. You haven't even tried it yet. Chocolatke? No goodke? -[laughing] -scott... Giorgio's number. How did you find him? It took a little bit of research, and, uh, a good friend whose dad was in the italian army. Oh... What do I say after all this time? How do I tell him such enormous news? That's what you wanted, isn't it? Yes, I want this for christina. Why don't you give him a call? Thanks. [dialing call] [inhaling deeply] [call ringing] [phone ringing] pronto? Giorgio... Ciao. It's ruth. Ruth? Non ci credo. Che bella sorpresa! [ruth] sì. Yeah, it's... It's been a long time. How are you? I'm good. Tutto bene. And you? I'm great. I'm just... I'm so happy to hear your voice. Giorgio... Sì? I have something important to tell you... But I just don't know how. And what could it be after so many years? Ruth, I'm older and wiser and hard to surprise. What is it? Giorgio... You and I... We have a daughter. You... Che cosa? We have a daughter. [♪♪♪] I'm so glad that we're finished. My mom, she used... She loved this angel, and every christmas, it was just like being reunited with an old friend. She is a beauty. [laughing] thank you. Any time. Okay, I have to order the brisket to serve with my hanukkah dinner, and then we need to get the wine, to serve that with the feast of the seven fishes, and the galliano to serve after the meal, and there's so much to do, and I'm not even halfway through my list. Which list? I'm spending so much time on my hanukkah dinner that there's no way I'm going to be ready for my christmas eve dinner. Mm-hmm. Is this about having two dinners... Or two mothers? Stressing about a brisket is how I avoid my feelings, thank you very much. Aha. Oh, you just love being right. Mm-hmm. And since I have some credibility, let me offer another pearl. Oh, if this is about david, okay, you don't have to say it. Okay, I like david. I like him. But that doesn't mean that I'm ready for a new relationship, not that anybody is asking, including david... What? What? I was just going to suggest that we update the website. [laughing] okay. Okay. Yes. I'm good with that. ♪ children smiling ♪ I'm so glad you were home. I didn't expect to see you tonight. Tomorrow night's the last night of hanukkah. Well, I figured you might need this, so I wanted to give it to you in advance. Aw... ♪ the words repeat ♪ "here's to celebrating the old and the new." david... It's very sweet. Okay, here we go. Oh, david, it's beautiful. It's italian. Bellissimo. I would like to know how to say the prayer. Okay. All right. Let's do this. So the first line of the first prayer goes "barukh atah adonai." baroock... Okay. Barukh. Is that a "k" or a "ch"? Barukh. A little more phlegm. Barroke... [laughing] it's going to be a long night. [laughing] oh, no! Do it again. Okay. Barukh atah adonai. Oh, that is a beautiful menorah. David gave it to me as a gift. [all] oh... Okay. Okay. I've got this. Okay. Ahem. ♪ barukh atah adonai ♪ ♪ eloheinu melekh ha'olam ♪ ♪ asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav ♪ ♪ v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner ♪ ♪ shel hanukkah ♪ no way! -That's great. -That's awesome. Wow. ♪ barukh atah adonai ♪ ♪ eloheinu melekh ha'olam ♪ if it tastes half as good as it smells, you got yourself a home run. It's my first time at bat, so I'll settle for first base. Phil has to take the kids to his parents' for spin the dreidel and dessert. But we wanted to come here, too. -Thank you. -Yeah. One of the many joys of family, juggling the in-laws. You juggle me? You're too big to juggle. -[gasping] -[laughter] wow, look at all this food. It speaks to christina's generous nature. No, no, it speaks to my insecurity... When in doubt, just to keep on frying. Ah. The miracle of oil taken to new heights. Mm. -These are as good as mom's. -No way. 'cause she taught me how to make them. Must be my dna kicking in. What's dna? Oh, it's that special stuff inside of us that makes us a family. These look so good, aunt christina. Thank you. I'm someone's aunt. [laughter] is hanukkah always this much fun? It depends on the family. I think I found the right family. [laughter] that's... That's for you, phil, and the kids. -Okay. -Yeah. Oh... Oh, my goodness! Look at this! Christina! Oh, they are going to love these. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. Oh, wait, there's something else in the box. What? No way! -[gasping] -what? Four floor seats to a cavaliers game? -What? Oh, my gosh! -Wow. Wow. The general manager is a customer at my restaurant. This couldn't be more perfect, christina. Okay, scott's turn! All right. [makes trumpeting sound] [laughter] whoa. A signed baseball from ernie banks? [ruth gasping] he's only, like, my favorite player of all time. My dad used to call him "mr. Cub." I mean, everybody did, but... Thank you... That doesn't even begin to cover it. You're welcome. Okay, somebody say something! All right. Close your eyes. Close my eyes. Let me just put this... Okay. All right. Ready. -Okay, don't look. -I won't look. No peeking. -All right. All right. -It's not a bottle of wine. What could it be? Is it a blender? One, two, three! Chateau jean-marc. It'll be good to drink in about 21 years. Maybe we can open it together. Stop. You're embarrassing me. Ooh... Thank you. -I'm sitting on your dress. -Oh, sorry. Let me see. Oh, my gosh. Look at this. What a beautiful dreidel! I don't know how old it is, but I thought that it was pretty. Oh... It's gorgeous. This... This is priceless. Wow. Thank you. Okay, now it's your turn. This isn't as amazing as the gifts you gave us. It doesn't get any more amazing than this. Okay. I'm excited. -Here. -Thank you. Oh, this was such a great night! Oh, look at that picture. [all talking at once] aw... Look at you two. You make a good couple. I want a copy of that. Okay. Oh, that one's my favorite. [all talking at once] this is a beautiful picture. Yes. And... And that is... That's your father, giorgio. Wow. He has... He has kind eyes. He was so handsome in his uniform. What was he like? Oh... He was charming, and... Very italian. And he had a smile that could light up a room. Like yours. Well... He looks like somebody I would like to get to know. Mm. Well... This is his phone number. Ooh. So... Oh, no. I'm sorry. You just call him when you're ready. Thank you for this. Would you guys... Would you guys like to come to my restaurant for my christmas eve dinner? There's going to be lots of food... -Sold. -[laughter] ...Fun. Nice people... Yes. Yes. We'd be honored. Great. Happy hanukkah. [♪♪♪] oh... Is everything okay? Yeah... No. I wanted to make a special dessert for christmas eve, and I found my mom's sfogliatella recipe. And we always just made it together, because this dinner was so important to her. And now I've invited ruth. I only have one mom, and that's complicated enough. But having two moms, that's... That's twice the love. Yeah. And then... There's david. Oh, what about him? I care for him. Aw... Well, what's the problem with that? I'm just overwhelmed. Why don't you just take your time and see what happens? Because when you... When you lose someone you love so much, it's very scary to love again. How could you not smile with a tree like that? Oh, I just have a lot going on. You deserve a break. Why don't we do something fun tonight? Ice-skating? A moonlit walk? Just to be clear, this is me asking you to go on a date. I have a lot to do. I don't think it's a good idea. Ice-skating... Or us going on a date? You're going away. You don't live here anymore. You don't know when you're coming back or how long you're going to stay, which is fine, it's only one date, but then what happens after that? I'm just... I feel like I'm just saying way too much, and I'm getting embarrassed, so please, just... Please just feel free to stop me. Please. That was a very charming rejection. It's not a rejection. I'm just not ready. My heart, it just can't keep up with all these changes right now. I understand. Let's just leave well enough alone. Christina... Just so you know, when I get on that plane, I won't just be thinking about where I'm heading. I'm going to remember everything I'm leaving behind. Arrivederci. Ciao. Warm you up a bit. Thanks. That was a good day. A snowman with a licorice smile. Mm-hmm. Yeah, he's smiling, but you're not. What's going on? I don't think christina and I will be seeing each other anymore. I think you're telling me this because you know what I'll say. What's that? Don't let her go. She's not ready for a relationship. Oh, no. She's just as guarded as you are. You, traveling everywhere, living life on the road, not committing to anything longer than a meal... This is your review of my life? Mm-hmm. Well, whatever it was that kept me in motion before, it just doesn't seem enough now. Ah, you fell for someone who's just as cautious as you are. [sighing] the only problem is... She might be the one. According to you? According to you and that look on your face. Just give her time. Just be her friend. The rest will follow when she's ready. So your review has a happy ending. [chuckling] I am christina's mother, and I want only the best for her... And I just happen to believe that the best is you. We have 9,000 steps to go. So david asked me on a date. Uh-huh. And I said no. What? Because he's going away after the holidays. Oh, for how long? I don't know. He doesn't know. But that's not the point. Okay, what is the point? I'm really going to miss him. I know you're scared, but that's how you know you have something real. When you take that leap of faith, that could lead to love. I don't know. Maybe. I mean, what I did is for the best, I'm sure of it... Except when I look at my christmas tree, or my menorah, or a picture of him. Oh... If this is for the best, I'd hate to see what dead wrong looks like. [both laughing] [♪♪♪] [knocking] hi. There's something I forgot to say, and I hope it's not too late. Okay. Come in. Now, we can take it as slow as you want, but I need you to know how much you matter to me. It's not that I don't care for you. I do. I'm going on my trip, and I'll be back in six weeks. And then I'm going to settle down and write my book... Here, in cleveland. I called phil and told him to find me a house. I am going all-out to get this date. Okay, but are you sure this is where you want to be? I want to be wherever you are. Come here. As incredibly complicated holidays go, this one is turning out really well. Christina, hi! Hi. Thank you for coming. Oh, yes. What can I do? Do you need help in the kitchen? I... I just...I need help making a phone call. Some moral support. I thought christmas eve would be a nice time to call my father. Yeah. I'm here for you. Whatever you need. Okay. I'll be right here. [call ringing] [phone ringing] hello? Is giorgio there? Christina? Yes. I've been waiting for your call. It's very nice to meet you. You are the most precious surprise. You must come to Italy. Will you? I would like that very much. Merry christmas. Okay, so when the restaurant reopens, I want to add some new items to the menu to reflect both sides of my heritage. She has another heritage? Yeah, christina took a dna test, and it turns out she's half-jewish. Oh. I have a brother, a sister, and a biological mother. Aw, that's wonderful. Is... He your brother? No. That's david singer. The one who wrote the review. And he came back to make the feast of the seven fishes? Aw, it's a long story. Hello. Hi, christina! Hi. I like your restaurant. You do? Well, I hope you come here all the time. Hi. Merry christmas, christina. Happy holidays. Oh, christina, it looks lovely. Thank you. This is what sophia would want for you. Don't forget, your mother always made a little toast, uh? Mm-hmm. She did. [chuckling] hi. Wow. I spoke to my father. And he wants me to come to Italy. Maybe we can go together. I think we can embrace the old and the new, and I can celebrate hanukkah and christmas every year. And I can do it with you. Christina, I cannot wait. [spoons ringing glasses] [cheering] okay. Thank you all for being here. I think you know how much tonight means to me. I made a christmas wish this year. I wanted to have love in my life... And my wish came true. Aw... Brava. Cheers. -Happy christmas. -Merry hanukkah. [cheering] mazel tov! Come here. [cheering] [applause] and one more. Salud! Here's to many, many more. Ah! I'm so happy for you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
