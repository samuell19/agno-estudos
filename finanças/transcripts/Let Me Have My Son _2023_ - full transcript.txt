(Logo chiming musically) (Soft music) [Ben vo] Can I tell you the story of my son? Well, perhaps, more the story of his father. A good bit of what you're about to see is true as it happened. More is true, though, as to how it felt. And more than that, I suppose, is true of how it will be. (Soft music continues) (Wind blowing) [Benny] Dad! [Benny vo] I want to come home, dad. I want to come home. [Ben vo] I know, son. I know. [Benny vo] Please, dad. Please. (Soft music crescendos) Benny! Where are you? (Clock ticking softly) (Wind blowing) (Ben groaning) (Ben exhaling sharply) (Soft jazz music) (Muttering) Is this a copy? I don't know. That's Ginny, but... Wait, I've already been through this box. (Phone dialing) [Ginny] Hi, this is Genevieve. Leave your message after the beep. Yeah, hey, Ginny. I could use some help with these photo albums. I know you're busy. Anyway, um, and I... Well you may not be able to get to it right away, but listen, give me a call when you can, okay? Thank you. (Soft jazz music) Ah, okay. (Clocks ticking) (Ben muttering softly) (Clocks ticking loudly) (Cuckoo clock chiming) Yeah. (Ben groaning) (Clocks ticking erratically) (Ben grunting in pain) (Ben thudding) (Cuckoo clock chiming loudly) (Phone ringing) (Ben grunting) Ginny! (Ben grunting in pain) [Ginny] Hello? Ginny...! Dad, is that... hello? (Ben grunting) Dad! Oh my god, what is wrong? (Chiming stops suddenly) (Gentle piano music) (Sirens wailing) (Machines beeping distantly) (Staff murmuring indistinctly) (Water trickling) [Dr. Das] Mr. Whitmore? The cath lab team will be here soon. They may need to place some more stents in your heart. [Dr. Knight] He'll need to stay here a few more days a massive heart attack causing significant... He shouldn't drive for at least several weeks... He's going to need 'round the clock nursing care at home... You grew up here? Yeah, but without all the clocks. It's a hobby of his. He's always talked about turning it into a business, but usually ends up repairing everything for free. (Clock chiming deeply) He used to be a history teacher, professor Benjamin Whitmore sr. That's how I remember him growing up. Where does he eat? Usually at the counter over here. Mustard packets, styrofoam cups. Why doesn't he just use real glasses? He has them right here. Oh, come on. (Faucet running) (Clocks ticking) My mom. Oh, she's beautiful. She was a dancer, ballet and modern. I've always wanted to do that. Me and my brother, Benny. Sweet. Mom and dad. (Doorbell ringing) Right in here. What's this bed doing down here? You'll be sleeping downstairs for a few weeks. No arguments. It's too noisy down here. I can't sleep down here. - Is that so? - Yeah. I thought you liked the sound of ticking clocks. Who are you? Hello, Mr. Whitmore. I'm Holly Christmas. Huh? Holly Christmas. Christmas Holly? No, sir. Christmas is my last name. Holly is my first name. Holly Christmas. [Ginny] Miss Christmas is here to help you. I don't need any help. You're getting stay-at-home care. It's too expensive. Doctor's orders and insurance paid for it, so zip it. Miss Christmas is staying here overnight. Where's she gonna sleep? Oh, I won't be sleeping, Mr. Whitmore. I'm gonna be up all night long. I'm gonna be on duty and I'll probably just sit in that chair over there and maybe watch some TV. [Ben] So you're gonna stay up all night. All night, making sure that you're okay. That's my job. See? I'm gonna go, but I'll be back to check on you in the morning, okay? Maybe we can work on those photo albums together. [Ben] Yeah. All right. I'm gonna hold you to that, Ginny. Please do. Thank you, miss Christmas. You're very welcome. Well, come on. Help me get out of this chair. Of, course. (Ben grunts) Here, let me get this blanket off. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. What about your coat? - You want me to take your coat? - Yeah, yeah. (Silverware clinking) Mmm. Can I get you some more? Yeah, I wouldn't mind it. (Clears throat) You're a good cook. Well, always thank the chef. You know, your daughter was showing me some of the family photos. Yeah? You're a blessed man. Thank you. There you go. No, it's too much. Just eat what you can. But I don't like to waste food. Okay, well, I'll tell you what. Whatever is left over, we'll just put it in the fridge, okay? How's that? Uh huh. (Clocks ticking softly) (Phone ringing) (Voices on TV murmuring) Christmas, get the phone. (Cuckoo clock chiming) Answer the phone. (Phone ringing) Christmas! (Clocks ticking loudly) (Phone ringing incessantly) The phone! Christmas Holly, get the phone! It's ringing. Hey! Wake up! The phone! (Ben groaning) (Phone ringing loudly) Hello. [Nurse Nakamura] Ben Whitmore, please. Speaking. Hello, this is nurse Nakamura from middle mouth security hospital. Good morning, sir. Good morning. How's your day going, sir? I don't know. What time is it? This comes as a big surprise, right? But I have good news to share with you. Yes? - Your son, Benny. - Yes? Benny is going home. Could... what? Say that again. Your son, Benny. Benny's being discharged today. Benjamin Whitmore Jr. You are excited, right? Decision is now final. You got the letter? - No. - You moved house? - No. - Hmm. Well, anyway, wonderful news, right? How soon can you get here, Mr. Whitmore? (Ben sighs) Three, four hours? Okay. See you later, then. Yeah. Yeah, I... Can I talk to him? No, he's asleep. Okay. I'll see you later. - Okay, goodbye. - Thank you.

And disappointment fades with time. How many years has it been now? Admittedly, (sighs) They have blended together, but I have not given up hope. I have not given up hope, and I never will. (Group murmuring and laughing) Benjamin, Genevieve, David. These are my treasures. - Good morning. - Good morning. - ID? - Yeah. [Gate guard] Who are you seeing today? Benjamin Whitmore Jr. - You know where to go? - Oh, yeah. Thank you. [Gate guard] Have a good visit. Oh, it's, uh, it's not a visit. I'm taking him home. (Bright guitar music continues) [Ben vo] We have a history of mental illness in the family, yes, but I never thought it would touch him. No, not him. It came and took him away. It took him away from all of us. But now... (Ben sighs deeply) I'm taking him home. (Ben coughing and grunting) (Pills rattling) I wonder if he still has that purple shirt I got him. I want him to wear it when we leave here. Purple. The color of royalty. That's my son. That's my son. (Soft piano music) Hello, I'm here to pick up Benjamin Whitmore Jr. ID? (Phone ringing distantly) (Samantha whimpering and whispering softly) (Ben sighing) (Phone continues ringing) [Ben vo] I always wondered what form his healing would take. Would it be sudden before my eyes? Or would I walk into his room one morning and find him sitting there, healed and in his right mind? [Gonzalo] Benjamin Whitmore? (Phone ringing) Wait here. Yeah, I know the drill. [Announcer over pa] Dr. Dhopte, conference room c, main level. Dr. Dhopte, conference room c, main level. Dr. Dhopte, conference room c, main level. (Ben muttering indistinctly) [Ben]... including those with co-occurring morbidities. client-based communities below the 49th parallel. Mental recovery in ancient, and inclusion... Old-fashioned... milky way... (Phone ringing distantly) [Dr. Bitter man] Mr. Whitmore? Mr. Whitmore? Dr. Bitter man. Won't you join us, please? Yeah. - This way. - Thank you. Please take a seat, Mr. Whitmore. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. How's everybody doing? How you doing, Mr. Whitmore? Ah, nurse Nakamura. "Konnichiwa". You gave me quite a start this morning. I called early, right? You did, you did, but I did not mind. It was such a pleasant surprise, such exciting news. I wasn't aware that this news took you by surprise, Mr. Whitmore. Well, I've been out of touch a bit, admittedly, several months or so, at least. Maybe more. Three months, four? I've been having health issues, which have curtailed my visits and... Hand this to Mr. Whitmore. I am somewhat out of touch. And nurse Nakamura mentioned there was a letter that came to me, but I never got a letter, so I'm not sure what that was about. So you need a signature here somewhere. You're Benny's guardian, so yes, you need to sign it. - Okay. - And um, make sure you date it. You know, I always knew this day would come. I always believed it would happen. And it's finally here. (Laughing) I mean, it's hard to take in. Weren't you the ones who told me that he would never get out of here? That he was a lifer? Dr. Bitter man, didn't you say that? Remember how you leveled with me, Dr. Dhopte, that Benny's condition was just too grave, too serious, that he would never leave this hospital. And now, from one day to the next? It's like a miracle. I call it a miracle. What do you call it, Dr. Bitter man? Just sign the paperwork, Mr. Whitmore, please. We have other meetings to get to. So I just sign at the bottom somewhere. - And the date. - Where are the page numbers? - Who writes this stuff? - Put down the date. What is the date, anyway? Does anybody really know what time it is? It's the 13th of the month. If you say so. You know, I was in the visitor's room just a while ago and looking at your mission statement on the wall. I noticed you have it up here, too, right behind me. Same mission statement. And you know, I sat there. This happened more than once, doctor. In fact, it's happened every time I've ever come here, I start to read the mission statement and I get through the first sentence. That makes sense, somewhat. And then I read the second sentence, which does not make as much sense as the first sentence, but I read the third and that's totally out of the ballpark and I have no idea what I'm reading. So I go back to the first and I try to read that as well as the second and the third, kind of get the big picture, but at the end of the day, it just kind of all runs together and puts me to sleep. Yeah... And then you realize that there is no big picture. It's just a lot of broken pieces. Mr. Whitmore, please. We're running out of time. Time. Hmm. So if I sign this, it means that I take Benjamin home with me today. Is that right? The date, please. Put down the date. (Tense music) (Alarm blaring) (Voices shouting) What is that? Huh? What is that? I'll take you to Benny now. Let's go. (Shouting continues) [Andy] Don't you dare... Okay... I got you now! (Shouting continues) I will take you back on the ward now, Mr. Whitmore. But I didn't sign the paperwork. You can do that later. Let's go. (Dancers muttering) [Ben vo] Ah, I remember him. Vincent van Gogh. (Speaking in French) Sir, excuse me, sir. Can I get a hug, sir? [Nurse Nakamura] Sorry, no touching allowed. Do that with family. [Ben vo] Not much has changed since my last visit. Vincent, the painter. - [Nurse Nakamura] What's up, Oscar? - [Jeff] I don't have a family! I've gotta pee so bad. Go ahead and pee, Oscar. [Ben vo] Oscar and his chronic need to use the bathroom. Standing up or sitting down? Standing... [Jeff] I don't have a family, ma'am. Go pee, Oscar. [Oscar] Are you sure it won't hurt you? [Ben vo] Sonny and another puzzle. [Oscar] I won't flush you down the toilet, will I? What about the roller coaster? It won't chop your head off, will it? I gotta pee so bad. [Ben vo] And somewhere in the midst of all this, my son. (Group murmuring) [Patient] Last time, he came right by me... [Patient shouting] Let me out of this hell hole! [Ben vo] How is it some are stricken, others not? (Shouting and banging continues) A broken bone will mend. But a broken spirit? (Patient shouting) [Ben vo] Who can cure it? This is the full measure of man. (Shouting and banging continues) This is the full measure of man. (Somber piano music) Hmm, he's not here. He might be in the infirmary for a checkup. You stay here and you pack up his things, okay? I will come back with some boxes. All right. Happy day, right? Yeah. You'll be with your son again. Nurse Nakamura... (Speaking in Japanese) (Somber piano music continues) "For dad, 1 corinthians 15:19-20. If only for this life. Benny." (Phone ringing distantly) (Straps clattering) [Ben] Ah, Mr. Awale. Good to see you, sir. Good morning, Mr. Whitmore. Nurse Nakamura asked me to give you these. Ah, thank you. Thank you. It must have been sudden. What is that? Benny, getting better like that. I didn't find out about it myself until this morning. I always believed he would get better, Mr. Whitmore. Yeah. I wrote this little book about him. I've seen him with the book many times. Looks like he must have read it. Started out as prayer letters sent to friends. [Announcer over pa] Code blue. Medical response team. People I could trust to pray for him. Seems your prayers have been answered, Mr. Whitmore. Yeah. All I ever, all I ever wanted for him was to have some dignity, you know? Just a little dignity. A job of some sort. A janitor, maybe, I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. No, I understand. Yeah, those were dark days, Mr. Awale. Dark days indeed. When was the last time you saw him? (Sighs) I had a dream about him a few days ago. But dreams don't count, do they? Yeah. Anyway, we should be rejoicing, right? This is a day of celebration. Look at this. No more of this. (Straps clattering) I don't even know if I should put 'em in the box or in the trash can, but maybe you could gimme a hand? - I'd sure appreciate it. - Sure, happy to help. (Wind whistling) (Samantha weeping) I heard you crying. How do you cope? (Samantha continues sobbing) Sometimes, I play the guitar. [Announcer over pa] Attention. Your attention, please. Paging Benny Whitmore. Benny Whitmore, please I'm sorry, I have to go. [Announcer over pa]... at once. Benny Whitmore, come to the infirmary. (Samantha sobbing) [Dr. Bitter man] Miss Nakamura. (Arguing in German) (Arguing in Japanese) Oh, Mr. Whitmore, we were just looking for you. We need you in the infirmary. Let me show you the way. [Announcer over pa] Attention, code blue, third floor. Big hungry, come on. Third floor. Step on it. [Ben vo] Something wasn't adding up. - [Announcer over pa] Attention. - Code blue, third floor. [Ben vo] Why was Mohamed warning me? I became even more intent on finding my son. [Oscar] I don't want hurt him. If I go I'll hurt him, but I don't wanna hurt anybody. But if I don't, no, I don't wanna hurt anybody. [Ben] Shh, shh, one word at a time. I said, is god okay? What do you mean? When I go pee, do I hurt god? No. No, of course not. Are you sure? I'm sure. Just go to the bathroom, it'll be okay. Standing up? Well, yeah, if you have to go pee, stand up. And wash my hands after, right? (Soft piano music) Do you, do you hear that? The music. You'll be all right, though? Go to the bathroom. [Glad is] Okay, everyone. We're going to do something different today and I think you're going to enjoy it. Oh, come in. Please, come in. - [Announcer over pa] - Your attention please... I heard the music. Of course. Of course you did. [Announcer over pa] Garbage receptacles to the loading dock. But... Wanna have a seat? What's your name, friend? - My name? - Yes. Yes, friend. Whitmore. Ben Whitmore sr. Everyone, let's give a warm welcome to Ben Whitmore sr. (Fingers snapping) Welcome. [Ben] Thank you. You know, it sounded like my son, David, was in here playing the piano. Your son, David? Mm. I could hear the music from outside. It was coming from in this room. Whitmore. Do you happen to have another son named Benny? - Yes. - Benny Whitmore. Yes, my oldest. Of course, of course. It's so nice to meet you. I'm glad is peregrino, social worker. Oh, pleasure. Yeah, they called me early in the morning to come and get Benny, but I don't know where he is. Do you guys know Benny? You must know Benny, right? This is my son, Benny. Does this look familiar? Benny, yeah. They called me up at, I don't know what time it was, to come and get him, that he's being discharged. [Glad is] Well, I'm sure he'll turn up. [Ben] Yes. Here, why don't you grab a mask and show us how you feel. - Like, like they're doing? - Yes. [Ben] Kind of reminds me of a venetian party mask. [Glad is] All right, everyone, I'm going to say a word or a short phrase, and I would like you to use your mask to show us how that word or phrase makes you feel. All right? Okay, here we go. (Patient blowing nose) Um... childhood. (Distant alarm sounding) Terri, you have a happy face. Would you tell us what made your childhood happy? I got that one wrong. Oh, well then tell us what made your childhood sad. - Everything. - Everything? So, no rays of sunshine along the way? Hmm. We'll have to work on that, okay Terri? It's all about perspective. Oh, yes, gonzalo? How may we help you? [Announcer over pa] Attention, your attention, please. Rosencrantz and gildenstern. Rosencrantz and gildenstern. Your Chinatown delivery is up front. (Door thuds) (Glad is sighs) Chinatown delivery up front. [Sidney] "N-n-n-non fui. Fui. Non sum. Non... Non curo." What was that, Sidney? I couldn't understand you. "Non f-f-f-fui. Fui. Non s-s-s-sum. Non c... C-C-Curo!" You speak Spanish? Yes, yes. That's Latin. - "Non fui," I was not. - Of course. "Fui," I was, meaning I was born. I came into the world. "Non sum." Right? "Non sum"? "Non sum," I no longer am. I have died, basically. And then, "non curo"... Well, who cares? It's all over. It's all gone. From nothing to nothing. Epicurus, Greek philosopher of the 4th century, bc. - [Glad is] Impressive. - [Ben] Yeah. You f-f-follow my teacher? Well, I wouldn't say I follow him. On a bad day, maybe, you know. Depression gets the best of a lot of us, I suppose. What are we up to now? 20 million nationwide? 30 million? So do I understand you, Sidney, you're saying your life does not have any purpose? (Sidney sighs) My life's got purpose. Damn right. I'm glad to hear that, jock. Very glad to hear. 'Cause we all need purpose in life, right? "Non fui. Non sum... F-f-f-f-f-f... (Jock mocking Sidney) - [Glad is] Jock! - "Curo"! Jock, that's not very nice. What? He annoys me, all right. Talking his f-f-foreign languages and crap. Okay. He should be in speech therapy. This? This is a mental hospital, right? [Glad is] Jock, please. For people with real problems. [Glad is] Come on, jock. - [Jock] Not for freaks. - Not for people like him. [Glad is] All right, sit down. - Right? - Right now. Not for morons, not for losers and phonies. - Jock, please sit down. - Just freaks. Hey, hey, hey. Sit down. - Sit down, okay? - [Sidney] M-m-miss... - M-Miss p-p-p-p... - Thank you. All right. [Sidney] P-p-peregrino? Yes, Sidney? [Announcer on pa] Code red. Code red. May I be allowed to s-s-say the final word? Of course. I would s-s-simply like to s-s-say... [Jock] S-s-s-spit it out. Come on. Go on. Come on, come on, come on. S-S-Simply like to say, - [announcer on pa] Code red... - "There is no s-s-sin like s-s-stupidity." Oscar wilde. Oh, here we go. Are you making fun of me? Are you calling me stupid? He can't even get two sentences out! Boys. You're the reason they put directions on shampoo b-b-bottles! Spit it out! Spit it out! Noise! (Sirens blaring) You ate too much paint chips! [Jock] Stuttering punk! Noise! You're disturbing the other patients. (Terry crying) Keep it down in here. All right? Or I'll put a beating on you! (Alarm blaring) [Announcer over pa] Attention, code blue, third floor. - Medical response team, third floor. - [Glad is] Okay. - I know where you sleep, buddy. - [Glad is] Okay. I know right where you sleep. All right, all right. Let's use our coping skills. Let's take a deep breath, everyone. Come on. (Everyone inhaling and exhaling) Ben. We're having dance therapy later. Would you like to join us? I have to find my son. - [Announcer over pa] - Your attention please. Let's breathe one more time. Come on. [Announcer over pa] Dr. Josef bitter man, please report to lost and found, very nice. [Dr. Alejandro] Before cartoons, after cartoons, before chess, okay? "Vámonos". That's it, let's go. I love to see it. "Muy bien. Gracias, gracias". [Announcer over pa] Please come to lost and found and in between. Excuse me, you're a doctor, I presume. How may I help you? Do you happen to know my son Benjamin? Benjamin Whitmore Jr? Benny? Everyone here knows Benny. Uh, very interesting case. I don't believe we've met. I'm Ben Whitmore sr. Doctor Alejandro. (Speaking in Spanish) They called me really early this morning to come pick him up and take him home, and... but I don't know where he is. - That is curious. - Yeah. Maybe you could point me to the infirmary. You don't want to go there. Why not? Dr. Bitter man said I should go to the infirmary. (Speaking in Spanish) Let's see, Whitmore, Benjamin. Ah yes, yes, yes. Date of birth, April 1983. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Current episode, hypomanic to manic, experiencing hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, aggression towards self and others. Medicinas, clozapine for psychosis, 200 milligrams at 8:00 am, 12 noon, 6:00 pm. Depakote for seizures... How could he possibly get better with all those meds? [Dr. Alejandro] ...One milligram twice daily for anxiety. Propranolol, 40 milligrams twice daily for impulsivity. Zoloft, 100 milligrams each day for depression. Trileptal, 900 milligrams twice daily for agitation. St. John's wort as needed. Zyprexa, 10 milligrams twice daily for psychosis. 30 milligrams Zyprexa every night at bedtime, also for psychosis. Miralax powder and senna plus for constipation. He was a normal boy. There was nothing wrong with him. (Tense music) I failed him. I couldn't steer him in the right direction. (Speaking in Spanish) I thought I was taking him home. (Speaking in Spanish) They told me to come and get him. It's time for your meds, Alejandro. (Speaking in Spanish) Here you go. (Tense music) Come along, Alejandro. It's nap time. How many times have I told you not to disrupt me when I am consulting my patients? (Speaking in Spanish) Do you know who you're talking to? (Speaking in Spanish) [Nurse] Yes, doctor. (Speaking in Spanish) [Nurse] Alejandro. (Speaking in Spanish) [Voice of Franklin d. Roosevelt on radio] Vice president, speaker, members of the senate, and the house of representatives. Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan. (Radio static screeches) (Maria screaming) [Andy] Knock off the screaming, will ya? (Maria screaming) Come on! (Grunts) (Maria screaming) [Gonzalo] Sit down, now. Hey, hey, get back here. Sit down. Shhh. [Andy] How many times do we have to tell you this, Maria? Nobody likes it when you scream, all right? Gonzalo, open her mouth. [Ben] Hey! Hey, what are you jackasses doing? Leave her alone. Pick on somebody your own s- what are you doing in here? - Ow! - You gotta go. Come on. Gonzalo, get the door! [Announcer over pa] Attention, your attention please. Are we going to the infirmary now? Move it. [Jeff] Sir? Can I get a hug now, sir? What's your name? Jeff. My name is Jeff, sir. [Ben] All right, Jeff. Move it. Visiting hours are over. You know what? The more time I hang around here, the more questions I have. Are you letting Benny go because he's better? Or do you need his room for another patient? Ah, come on. Come on.

You should have seen him run. (Soft music) [Ben vo] He was a normal boy. No. No, that's not quite right. He was extraordinary, handsome, athletic. His high school track coach told me he had dollar signs on his feet. That particular day, he had camped out in a neighbor's yard with our dog, and the neighbor called the police. (Sirens wailing) (Tires screeching) (Leaves rustling) But all he did was sit in the guy's yard. And wouldn't leave when asked and then he pushed him, which, technically speaking, that's assault. Yeah. Look, I kind of know how you feel. My brother had to be institutionalized. Then after about 10 years or so, well, he started getting better. I think the medication helped, but he always maintained that it was his faith that got him through. And today he leads a fairly normal life. He takes his meds... (Ben sighs) Look, all I'm trying to say is that there's hope. Here, give that number a call tonight. You can check in on him. Dad? Why do they got me in here? When Benny turned 18, he was involuntarily committed here to middle mouth. "Mentally ill and dangerous," they called him. A traveling judge would come every six months to review his case. The guy always reminded me of an auctioneer, the way he'd talk. It was like, (mimics fast-talking auctioneer) And then bang would the gavel go on the desk. And Benny would be recommitted for another six months. (Somber music) [Ben vo] Five and a half years passed. Dr. Bitter man told me he'd never leave the hospital. I couldn't accept that and began making other plans. I became Benny's legal guardian and that gave me the leverage I needed. I got him out of middle mouth and we moved as a family to Mexico, Mexico City. Why Mexico? Have those guys been bothering you again? If they do, you come to me. I'll fix 'em. And your name, young lady? Maria. [Cal] Mexico is far away, you know. That's the key. But I'll tell you what I think. Nobody cares what you think. Every door has a key, you see. - [Patient] Shut up. - Oh, come on. The key is the key, even here in middle mouth. And once the key has set you free, you'll be free indeed. Every key has a every, every door has a key, you see? Please continue, Mr. Whitmore. We're all very interested. - That's the key... - Come on, guys. Let's listen. Well, Benny went to a psychiatric hospital in Mexico City and then after a few months, the doctors sent him home. They thought he would do better with his family. (Peaceful music) And for a while he did. He did do better at home. (Water splashing gently) [Ben vo] Sometimes the best cure is love, Patience, peace. I hired two local men, Samuel and césar, to help me take care of him. [Samuel] Hey, Benny... (Speaking in Spanish) [Ben vo] Genevieve and David, Benny's sister and brother, handled it well, for the most part. They began learning Spanish, going to school, making friends. Okay, that sounds good. [Ben vo] I was asking a lot of them, I know, doing all this for their brother's sake, but they adapted to their new home and well, I began to finally see a way forward. You know, there's a lot we can learn from Mexico. Like what, professor? Professor? How did you know I was a professor? Just had a feeling, I guess. And your name, young lady? I'm Terri. T-e-r-r-i. - Terri. Okay. - [Patient] Hi, Terri. Maria and Terri. [Ben vo] Well, it's a warm-hearted culture, Terri. They call it "calor humano" in Spanish. Kind of touchy-feely, if you will. You won't easily find yourself left alone in Mexico, and you'll crowd more people into a car than you can possibly fit. Maybe you'll go over to a friend's house unannounced and stay for dinner. Maybe you'll just cry on their shoulder and they'll cry on yours. (Group shouting excitedly) (Car horn honking) Okay, pop quiz. What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Mexico? [Patient] Taco bell? [Ben vo] I wager it won't be an ice skating rink, but that was just one of the things we enjoyed as a family. Well, maybe not David as much. He liked to play the piano and cook. Ah, but méxico... (Speaking in Spanish) The people showed us great kindness. They offered us refuge, a place to gather strength. And Benny? (Ben sighs) Well, Benny began to slowly recover. We went swimming in the pacific ocean. (Water splashing) We rode on horses, hiked through the mountains. Whoo! Okay, "otra". Another one. (Peaceful Latin music) (Benny laughing) [Ben vo] We moved to the valle de bravo area and rented a house next to lake avándaro. It was quite the place. I heard it was owned by a drug lord. I didn't ask too many questions, as you can imagine, but the rent was reasonable, so we moved in and lived there for about a year. [Jeff] Sir, sir, can I get that hug now, sir? - (Group grumbling) - [Patient] I'll hug you. Here we go. You're Jeff, right? [Jock] Why don't you go hug yourself? You can call me Jeff. - Sit down. - But none of the rest of yo use. - Sit down. - I'm Mr. Jeffrey to you. Mr. Jeffrey. Loser. Looney tunes. - Every time, Jeff. - Jeff. You shut up. [Jock] Sit down before I put you down. - I'm getting a hug from him. - It's okay, it's okay. [Jock] Go hug the moon, you freak. Sir, I want that hug, sir. - Hug me, hug me, hug me. - You shut up. [Ben] Okay, Jeff. Sir. I want that hug, sir. - Maybe later, okay? - Okay. Where was I? [Cal] Mexico. - You was in Mexico. - Come on, professor. Finish the story. (Peaceful guitar music) [Ben vo] A few miles away was a monarch butterfly sanctuary. The butterflies migrate there from Canada every winter, a distance of about 3,000 miles. It's amazing how they'll fly all around you, but never seem to quite touch you. Ah, you've never seen anything so beautiful. (Peaceful guitar music continues) In valle de bravo, it seemed I had my son back. I truly thought he was being healed. (Water rushing) (Benny laughing and shouting) [Benny] I'm free! Thank you, lord! [Dr. Bitter man] And they all lived happily ever after. Isn't that how the story ends, Mr. Whitmore? (Patients whispering) A happy ending? Many of you know my son, Benjamin Whitmore Jr. You call him Benny. I call him Benny sometimes, too. I hope he didn't hit any of you. (Group muttering) I got a call early in the morning to come and pick him up today to bring him home. Haven't found Benny yet, but I suppose I will. And when I went to gather his personal effects together, I found this note that he had left for me, "for dad." He had written down a scripture verse, 1 corinthians 15:19-20. I have to believe it must have some special significance for Benny, or he wouldn't have left it for me. Can I read it to you from the Bible? Would that be okay? Dr. Bitter man, is that all right? (Patients murmur in agreement) I'm gonna read it to you. This place is full of bibles. Here's one. 1 corinthians 15:19-20. "If only for this life, we have hope in Christ. "We are of all people most to be pitied. "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead. The first fruits of those who have fallen asleep." Preach it, brother. By golly, I think I will. [Patient] Praise the lord! It is a free country, after all. (Group clapping and whistling) We're in a chapel... So what's the first fruit? The one on top, usually a cherry. Maybe I could use an example from nature. The caterpillar, for instance, the lowly caterpillar. [Patient] Does this mean we go home now? It's born of an egg, gorges itself on leaves and plant life during its brief lifetime, wraps itself into a cocoon and dies, but is that the end of the story? No. (Patients muttering) Well, what happens next? It becomes a butterfly. A butterfly, yes. A beautiful butterfly. Yes, a beautiful butterfly. (Gonzalo clears throat) What, hey? What's going on here? (Group shouting and yelling) - Hey, no. - I'm preaching here. I got rights. I'm talking! (Group yelling indistinctly) [Patient] Equal rights for the mentally ill. (Triangle rings sharply) [Jock] Equal rights for the mentally ill. Bunch of punks! Let him go. Move it. Thank you, Dr. Bitter man. As I was saying, I came here earlier today to pick up my son who was being discharged and I was told to come and get him to pick him up, but I can't find him. No one knows where he is. No one can tell me where he is. Have you seen Benny? Have you seen Benny? Nobody can tell me where he is. Where is my son, Dr. Bitter man? Are you hiding him somewhere? Schizophrenia is an incurable disease, Mr. Whitmore. Incurable? Incurable. Yeah. Benny, of course, he is an exception. He shall rise like the Phoenix from the ashes. Isn't that right Mr. Whitmore? But go on. Finish your story from before. What else happened in Mexico that you haven't told us about? - Mexico? - Yes, Mexico. Did you get your happy ending? (Mumbling) It was around the new year. Excuse me, we can't hear you. The new year. (Speaking in German) Go on. (Somber music) (Fireworks crackling) [Ben vo] Around the new year, Benny had a sudden relapse. Everything just fell apart. No one could control him. The poor boy ran through town at night, "completamente loco". (Speaking in Spanish) He had fallen in love with a local girl he met at the church we were attending. Her name was lluvia, Spanish for "rain". Lluvia thought she could cure Benny with her love, her pure, virginal love. But Benny couldn't be cured. (Speaking in Spanish) [Ginny] These are pretty good. He hit me many times. (Fist thuds) [Ginny] Benny, no. (Group shouting) I'm sorry. [Ben vo] Broke down doors and windows. Let me go, I'm sorry. [Ben vo] Hit other people. Tell him I'm sorry. Dad, I'm sorry. Let me go! [Ben vo] I didn't wanna take him back to the hospital, but how could I keep him at home? Ginny, you okay? (Ginny crying) (Somber piano music) [Ben vo] We left that night for cholula, near the city of puebla, about four hours away. I remember stopping along the way so he could relieve himself. (Samuel and césar yelling) Samuel and césar eventually bound him with ropes and we finished the trip to cholula. [Benny] Dad! [Ben vo] With Benny in the trunk. (Benny screaming) I thought I was gonna die that night. There was just nothing left. (Benny screaming) [Terri] And his mother? Well, she never came with us to Mexico. We were divorced by then. She had her own struggles, which made it hard for her. Yeah. But she loved Benny. I know she loved him, but. I was on my own. [Ben vo] The hospital was called San Juan de dios, founded by a religious order centuries ago. [Benny] No! No. (Benny shouting, laughing) [Ben vo] "El manicomio"... - The insane asylum. - Dad! Dad! No! [Ben vo] The head psychiatrist, Dr. González, was a good man. - A good man. - No! [Ben vo] But nothing he tried, medically speaking, seemed to make a difference. Dad, where are you? [Ben vo] Benny stayed at the hospital in cholula for two and a half years. Don't leave me here. No! When I eventually did take him out of the hospital in cholula, we went to Belize. I thought we could start life over there and... Live on an island maybe. But that didn't work out. We made our way back to the states and Benny lived at home for about six months, but it wasn't possible to keep him. Then... It was back to middle mouth. Back to where... Back to where it started. Thank you for sharing with us, Mr. Whitmore. I know it's been very hard for you and your family. In truth, your story underscores what I have been saying all along. Benny will do best in an atmosphere of therapeutic positivism, a non-judgmental space where he feels no pressure to improve his mental health through his own efforts. But I've told you all this before, Mr. Whitmore. Sidney, could I have that hymnal please? Thank you. Remember when I brought you a hymnal, Dr. Bitter man? It had a red cover just like this. This is not about me, Mr. Whitmore. Yeah well, maybe it is, more than you realize. I remember hoping, praying that one of these old hymns of the faith would touch your heart, like this one. ♪ Come thou fount of every blessing, ♪ ♪ tune my heart to sing thy grace ♪ ♪ streams of mercy ♪ [Andy] C'mon. ♪ Never ceasing, ♪ ♪ call for songs of loudest... ♪ - Hey professor, look out. - Hey, no. [Gonzalo] Hey, back off. (Group shouting and yelling) [Jock] Let go of him! He's one of us. He's one of us! Step aside. Back off. (Group shouting increases) One of us! One of us! [Gonzalo] Where did he go? I said move over. Where's Whitmore? We need backup in here. [Andy] Come on, gonzalo, we gotta find him. [Announcer over pa] Your attention, your attention please. The quiet room is now open. (Whispering) The quiet room is now open. Quiet! - (Patient voices) Give me an e. - E! - Give me a c. - C! - Give me a t. - T! - What have we got? - Ect!

It's the one, it's the one. Got to fit. (Wheelchair clattering) (Speaking in Spanish) Following ect, it's not uncommon to experience headaches or pain in the jaw, accompanied by drooling. You may also experience some short-term memory loss. (Speaking in Spanish) You're in the patient's ward of middle mouth security hospital. (Ping pong ball bouncing) Your son is Benjamin Whitmore Jr., otherwise known as Benny, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. I've offered a second opinion to the hospital staff here on several occasions, but they've rebuffed me each and every time. [Sonny] Get in there. Get in there, dammit. [Dr. Alejandro] You've got the wrong piece, Sonny. That piece doesn't go there, Sonny. Piss off, you quack. That doesn't fit because it was not designed to go there. It'll never fit there, "idiot a". (Speaking in Spanish) [Oscar] I don't wanna hurt him. If I go, then I'll hurt him, but I don't wanna hurt anybody. But this is the piece. This is the one. It fits here. It fits right here. Remind me of the definition of insanity. [Sonny] It's the one. My son. [Sonny] It's the right one. It goes there. It goes right there. (Puzzle piece rips) (Soft piano music) Okay, okay. Just relax, señor. [Ben] I can hear the music. Mohamed, Mohamed, a hand please. - Mohamed. - Yes. Can you hear it? [Dr. Alejandro] Mohamed? (Soft piano music) Hey, hey. Benjamin? Never put your brain in this hospital. (Soft piano music) Hey, come back. Come back. You can be my son. You look like him. I'll take you home today. We'll go home today. (Ben weeping) I can't save him. I can't save any of you. I can't, I can't save you. (Ben sobbing) But... I can love you, love you. I can love you. I can love you. (Speaking in Somali) [Jeff] Sir? Do you want a hug, sir? [Ben vo] A different spirit came over me that day. I had not found my son, yet I could see him. I was with him and he with me. (Sonny laughing) I did it. I did it. Way to go, Sonny. - Great job. - I did it. You did it. Let's bring this to the arts and crafts room. - Now? - Yes, come with me. (Sonny laughing) "Muy bien", Sonny. "Muy bien". [Announcer over pa] Penny Miller, departure, gate 29. [Dr. Bitter man] How are you feeling, Mr. Whitmore? - [Announcer over pa] - Your attention, please. I have a headache. That's perfectly normal. Don't be alarmed. We have some pills for you. [Announcer over pa] Your Lincoln continental has arrived and is waiting for you at gate 29. That's a lot of pills. They're necessary, I'm afraid. I must be really sick. I've seen worse cases. Go ahead. They'll make you feel better. (Pills rattling) "Medice, cura te ipsum." "Physician, heal thyself." I never said I didn't believe, Mr. Whitmore. I only said, how can you know? Perhaps you would like to stay in your son's room tonight? But that's not possible. Well, doesn't it say in the good book that there are many rooms in the father's house? Hmm? This ain't the father's house. Well, let's not be overly judgmental. About my meds, Dr. Bitter man. Yes. I think I should go back on the risperdal, 30 milligrams twice a day. I was thinking the same thing, Dr. Alejandro. Might want to try 40 milligrams, though, and we can tweak the lithium. Hmm. Up or down? Slightly up, I think. It can be difficult finding the right balance of meds. It'll be all right. I don't know. I sometimes have terrible bouts of depression. Dark, troubling thoughts (speaking in Spanish) You care about people. - You care about your patients. - I do, yes. I do. I really try, I do. - I really do. - You see... That's the best kind of doctor there is. (Whispering) Me and you... Hear that? Okay. Hear that? (Whispering continues) Hear that? Knock it off. You sound like a broken record. Hear that? Look. I'm having a conversation here. Go on, beat it. Hear that? What do you hear, Arthur? Birds. I don't hear no birds, Arthur. The birds are singing. - [Announcer over pa] - Your attention, please. Ben Whitmore sr. Paging Ben Whitmore sr. Yes, I do hear them, Arthur. I do. [Announcer over pa] Departure gate 17. - I didn't know birds sing in winter. - [Announcer over pa] Ben Whitmore sr. - Departure gate 17. - Chickadees chickadees sing in the wintertime. [Announcer over pa] Ben Whitmore sr. Paging Ben Whitmore sr. Departure gate 17. I can't see. (Peaceful music) [Mohamed] He's calling you, Mr. Whitmore. (Wings fluttering) Death be not proud. Though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, it is not so. (Bright guitar music) [Mohamed] Look at him run. Dollar signs on his feet. You're a good man, Mr. Awale. Only one is good, Mr. Whitmore. Only one. Here you go, Mr. Whitmore. Glad is, thank you. "De nada". Terri? Terri, what's wrong? I wish someone was looking for me the way you look for your son. Someone is looking for you, Terri. Someone's looking for all of us all the time. [Sonny] Take this. Thank you, Sonny. Give it to your son. For the journey. Thank you, jock. Can I? Consider it a carry-on. How will I find him? He'll find you, Mr. Whitmore. Just keep a steady pace. What do you think Benny might have been, Mohamed? [Mohamed] I don't know, Mr. Whitmore. I can't say. [Ben] (Sighs) Thanks. I'll see you on the other side. (Soft music) [Ben vo] As it happened. As it felt. As it shall be. (Somber orchestral music) Where can I go from your spirit? If I go up to the heavens, you are there. If I make my bed in the depths, you are there. (Several voices speaking in various languages) Goodbye, son. (Speaking in Spanish) (Dramatic music) (Phone ringing) (Clocks ticking) [Holly] He fell asleep soon enough, but then he woke up. I don't know what time it was. I get so confused with all of these clocks. I found him down the hall trying to take a picture out of one of those frames. It took a bit of talking, but I was able to get him to lie back down. [Ben] Hello? [Holly] I didn't hear the phone ring. Who's he talking to? Speaking. Dad. Yes, yes. I'll, I'll be there. I'll be there. Thank, thank you. Who was that? The hospital. Dr. Knight? No... Benjamin. Ben jam... Dad. [Holly] Who's Benjamin? They're discharging him. They want me to come pick him up. I need to change. Dad, just go lie down, please. [Ben] Now the dreams make sense. Who's Benjamin? [Ginny] My brother, Benny, he's, um, he's schizophrenic. We haven't seen him for... Four years. The last time he was discharged, he ended up on the street, and... So now we don't even know if he's... Oh, you've been through an awful lot, sweetie. An awful lot. Come here. (Somber music) [Ben vo] If only for this life, we have hope. [Benny vo] Dad. Over here. Over here, dad. Over here. (Hopeful music) (Wings fluttering) [Ben vo] For those whom you think you overthrow, die not, poor death, nor yet can you kill me. You are slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men. [Benny vo] And with poison, war, and sickness dwell, and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well and better than your stroke; Why then do you swell? (Peaceful piano music) [Ben vo] One short sleep past, we wake eternally, and death shall be no more; Death, you shall die. (Uplifting piano music) [Benny] Come on, dad, let's go. Follow me. Run, dad, run. (Butterfly wings flutter) (Glass shatters) (Ben gasping and shouting) (Ben thudding) (Ben groaning) Benny? (No audible dialogue) [Ginny] Keep your eyes open. [Ben] (Weakly) I can't. - You can. - Mr. Whitmore... - You can. - I'm dying. I'm dying. You're not dying. Just keep your eyes... Look at me. Look at me. That's right, stay with me. (Piano music continues) I found him... Ginny... Yes... (Gasping) Your brother... (Shallow breathing) Yes. [Holly] Mr. Whitmore! (Dramatic orchestral music) (Wind blowing softly) [Gate guard] Good afternoon. - [Cristóbal] Good afternoon. - I'm here to see Daniel krusen. Okay and your ID, please. Yeah. Here you go. Do you know where you're going? Yes, sir, I do. Alright. Have a good visit. Thank you very much. (Bright guitar music) (Door opens) Hey, Daniel. Hey, dad. How you doing, daddy? I miss you so much. Whoo! I miss you, too. Would you like to go for a walk, dad? Will they let us go for a walk? - Of course. - All right, well, let's go. (Door squeaks) You can cut your own grass. That would be awesome. (Both laughing) You can ride a bicycle. Yeah, that would be awesome. You know, run down the beach. Go swimming. Yeah, run down the beach... And play basketball, okay? We'll play basketball, yes. I'm gonna try to beat you this time. (Daniel laughing) Let's go sit down over there. We'll sit down here. Yeah, that's good. - Sorry. - No, that's okay. Well, I used to play this one when you'd go to bed at night. Oh. [Cristóbal] "In the desert, a flower grows."
