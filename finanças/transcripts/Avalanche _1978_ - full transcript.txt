(mysterious music) (swelling music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (indistinct crowd chatter) - Oh, I have a reservation. For Caroline Brace. - I don't see it here. - Would you try Shelby please? - Oh right, so who are you, Shelby or Brace? - Brace until I married Shelby and then Shelby again, Brace again after the divorce. I don't feel like Shelby anymore. - Okay I'll change the reservation to Brace. - Thank you. - That's right, I'll take care of that for you. Please show Miss Brace to fourth floor. - Caroline! Caroline! He's over there. Oh Caroline, darling! Oh. Did David ask you here? - Yes. He didn't tell you? - Oh no that boy never tells his mother anything except goodnight. Are you gonna get back together? - Oh, you had to ask. Let me see, I have to think about that one. - Don't think. What is this, some obscene proposal? (chuckles) - There's a lot of ground to cover, it's all we-- - This person is called McDade. - Hello. - It's nice to meet you. - He works here. I always forget what your job is. - Bookkeeper. Excuse me, you really should-- - He's a bookkeeper. Hardly a VIP escorting the great man's mother around. No offense, McDade. I like you. - Thank you. There's a lot of ground we have to cover. - Let the heart guide the head, McDade. And have you got a fella? - Two or three. - Holy cow, are you gonna turn into a swinger? - (chuckles) Am I, let's see, could be. How is the great man? - Up to his ass in celebrity. - Hey Gary, what brings you to this opening? You said you were gonna quit competition. What decided you to turn pro? - I just want to be part of this whole fantastic thing going on here. - We assume that Mr Shelby-- - Hey Gary. - Very attractive? - Well she certainly help. Besides, I've never done the Golinda before. - Try the suicide jump? - Sure, why not? - What about you, Bruce? Are you gonna break that downhill record of yours tomorrow? - It wasn't part of the deal but I'll do my best for you. - Bruce, from the beginning you seem to thrive on risk. Have you ever known fear? - Well I never thought about it. I ski like I breathe or talk or make love. - Oh, kinda makes me wonder what you do best. - Boy, I'll say. He's established a record of that. (crowd applauding) - How are you? - Bruce! (chuckling) - You look fantastic! - Oh thank you. Kathy, come and get in the picture. Come on! - Hey Kathy come on. - You go ahead. - How you doing? A little nervous? - A little. - Wow, I can dig that, let me tell you. - That skier is too fast for Tina. - How do you girls feel about? - Well I admit, I do have my eye on the Show Me Awards. - I just wanna do the best I can. (soft piano music) - It's terrific to see you. The two of you together. (mumbles) - Hello dear. - How are you today? - Fine, sir. - Mother, you and McDade have a full schedule, there's an awful lot to see around here. - Can't we sit together awhile and have a drink and talk? - I would like to have some time with Caroline. - Come on, McDade. Thanks for the tour. - See ya. Hi. - Looking so good. Hold the elevator! (sighing) - You're looking well, maybe a little tired. - Excuse me, Mr. Shelby? - Yeah. - Any chance of us getting the shot of the Shelby trophy? - Sure, get all the boys together, meet me in my office. - [Man] Excuse me. - Come on, there's something I wanna show you. - Susan. - Yes David? Mr. Shelby? - This is Mrs. Shelby. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Susan Maxwell, my secretary. - Uh-huh. - Oh, did you get ahold of Marty Brenner? - Not yet. - Try again. - I just did. - Well keep on trying. - Okay! - David. It's just incredible what you've done. All of it, incredible. - Yeah (sighs). Took a lot of time, a lot of effort. (chuckles) You know. Through the whole thing I used to think a lot about how we used to lie around on Houston Street and talk a lot. Quiet elegance. Planet, remember? Well. - Well. I guess you got it. - Oh, hell, Caroline. Okay. You registered as Brace. - Yes? It's who I am. - I wanted to change it back to Caroline Shelby. - You can't do that. - You could. I wanna talk. I don't even know what I wanna talk about, I mean, can we just talk? - Sure. - This is the big one. Four years ago I came out here and I saw that mountain out there and I knew, I'm climbing it. I opened up this magnificent country for myself and for anybody who wants to join me. (mumbles) I fought like a son of a bitch. I fought the bank, I fought the government. I fought even my own corporation. Hell, I built an empire for them. And then the environmentalists, they say I'm destroying the environment. Come here, come here, let me show you something. Here. Look out here. Does this look like I'm destroying? I'm creating a beautiful life here. It's a good thing that's happening. - What's wrong, then? - One of the planning commissioners I had to deal with is under investigation. - What, about this? - Oh no. There's some other corporate connections. - Yeah, and? - (sighs) Well, I bought some of this land from one of those corporations. - Isn't that a matter of public record? (phone ringing) - Yes, and so is a sizeable contribution I made toward his senatorial campaign. Hello? Well keep trying. (slams phone) Damn it! - So what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna take you to lunch, I don't wanna talk about this mess, you're here, I... I love that you're here. I love you. - Lunch, huh? - Right. And, how is your life, are you still working for Harper's Bazaar? - Vogue-- - Oh yes I mean Vogue. (phone ringing) Hello. Right, send them in. (chuckles) Press. I'm David Shelby. (mumbling) Mr. Cavelli. (soft orchestral music) - I know, she's a little off center, like she wasn't twirler last year. She's getting it together. Thatta girl, Kathy! (screams) - You all right, Kathy? Need anything? It doesn't mean anything at all. It's all right, it's okay. - No Leo, it's not. I always do that to myself. When I saw her. - Yes, she'll get to you. You forgot how beautiful you are. Love yourself. And when you're doing that spin, you'll find your center and you'll let go. And don't let anything in the world guide you off your center. (frantic orchestral music) - So miners are digging for silver in the 1880s, and the mountain avalanched. Buried everybody. No one's dared touch it since. - Until David. Of course. David is amazing. How did he ever convince all those bankers? - He didn't. - He didn't? - Nobody else would follow him up here. He's all alone this time. - Alone? - Yes, he's risked everything he has. All his personal holdings. (whistles) (chainsaw buzzing) (trees crackling) - In case you haven't noticed, not only are we out of doors-- (breathing raggedly) And knee-deep in snow, but we are also going uphill! (breathing raggedly) - Always uphill. (chuckling) You get to the top. - Oh, if I had the strength, I would write that down. Oh! - Well, this is important. You can see. Mr. Shelby shall ice fish. He'll have an absolutely clear view. - Well, he's just like his father was. He has to be king of the mountain. - [Pauly] Hey Mr. Thorne! - [Nick] How ya doing, Pauly? - You were right about that salt lick, getting low. The mountain carried down from Big Face ever since the high wind. - All right, I'll bring you up one tomorrow. Your boss say your captain's low? - Yes sir. - Mr. Shelby and the architect decided it was desirable. We want an absolutely unimpeded view. - I see. - [Pauly] How's that stick, Mr. Thorne? - What are you doing this for, Pauly? - Man's gotta eat. (chainsaw buzzes) (snowball crashes) - What's the gimmick? - There is no gimmick now. That was the reaction of one stable snow to the sound waves made by that saw. In addition, Mr. McDada, the slope is not stable. With those trees missing, it's dangerous. Good day. - Who's he? - I'm sorry, his name is Nick Thorne. He's a photographer. And well-known. Got all the time in the world for nature. None for its development. (soft music) (orchestral music) (low rumbling) - Are you kidding? (avalanche rumbling) (orchestral music) - Oh! - Very neat. - Ah, piece of cake. - You got lucky. - [Bruce] Yeah. - What are you doing up here, I thought you were skiing Big Face? - Just felt like practicing on my own away from the crowds. - I would check conditions. - I just did. - Artie, don't argue with me, get your ass up here, damn it. Well something is going on! All right. This morning, some snot nose reporter started asking about Maybrook and the clearance of the land and I don't like it. Well it could mean a lot! I want you to get on that plane with a file and be up here by tomorrow night. God it's hard to come down from that guy. And don't give me that I don't approve look. - No, mm. I don't approve or disapprove. David, you're like weather, you just happen. I came to collect that lunch. - My god, lunch. Forgot. (chuckles nervously) - Supremacy tactics. - One day it'll work, watch. - Shelby! I wanna talk to you. - Oh, Nick. Good to see you. Someone I want you to meet, John. - You're crazy to cut down those trees. - Caroline, this is Nick Thorne. You know his work. - Oh yes, of course. - And this is my wife, Caroline-- - Mrs. Shelby. Look, let me put it to you this way. Without that cover, everything below that place you're building is open to a slide. - Oh Nick, we'll talk about it later this afternoon. - Oh, that's what you said last week. I wanna talk now. - (sighs) I'm sorry, honey. I have to talk to Nick. 20 minutes, a half an hour at the most. Then lunch-- - David, I'll see you at dinner, okay? Nice to meet you, Mr. Thorne. - But it's next to the banquet, we won't have any time. - At least I know you'll be there. - There's just not enough hazard up on that salt to carry on about cutting down a few trees. - There is a hazard, David. Look, these mountains have gotten along without you for a long time. - Oh, hello Tina. - Hi. - Go easy, huh? - Okay. - These mountains have gotten along without you for a long time and you come barreling in here with big plans to rearrange the whole thing. - No, Nick. Sharon. - Sharon? - Harry. Scotch on the rocks, you want a drink? - Nothing. You're risking the lives of everyone you are inviting here to Sharon. - That man works in front of the commissions, but now you have to deal with me. I want people to enjoy this land, not bury them in it. - Oh Dave. - Philip. - How you doing, Nick? Listen, David, I'm gonna need the rosters for-- - Will you, as a professional, tell this lunatic about the reports? - What reports-- - All of them, the snow reports, the whole damn thing. - Okay. They just finished skiing the entire area and all our data says it's fine. - I don't wanna hear about the surveys, Phil, I know what they say. What I'm asking you is why are you having cleaned off old (mumbles)? - Oh come on, Nick, I settled that corners day ago. - It's building. You got a storm coming in tonight and people all over that slope, and I don't know how you can ignore that hazard. - Hey now wait a minute. I'm not ignoring anything. Now there isn't a procedure in the book I haven't covered. - [Nick] You're stuck in the book, Phil, you always were. - That's right because it's my job. - [Nick] Look, before the slopes are open at least fire a shell into that ledge before it pulls the mountain down on us. - Now you listen to me. I love this place as much as you do and you damn well know it. And that storm should be over by morning, and right now everything says we're fine. - When was the last time you went up on that mountain and just sat? - Oh bullshit, Nick. I work up there-- - Just go up there and sit, Phil. - Ridiculous. - Just sit, Phil. Things aren't normal, there's a heaviness and it's growing. I can feel it. - Oh for God's sake. You want to panic the whole population because you feel a heaviness? Well let me tell you something, I don't move with your premonition, I move with my judgment. Come on, Philip, I'll get you your God damn papers. (easygoing music) (soft orchestral music) - [Caroline] Hi there! - Hello, Mrs. Shelby. - Huh? - I say, hello, Mrs. Shelby. - Brace. We're divorced. - I knew I'd seen you someplace before. - In the lobby. - No, it was before that. - Ah, on David's desk in a frame. - That's right. He's a tough guy. - Yep. - Do you like him? - Let me see, I have to think about that. I don't know. I love him. (chuckles) You know. - Sure. - Gosh, I hope there'll be a snow storm. While I'm up here I wanna see the whole works. I love snow storms, they make the world look entirely different, don't you think? - Different is better? - What do you think? - No, I think things look pretty good from right here. It's cold out here, aren't you cold? - Yep, I'm freezing. Come on inside. Oh. You coming to the party tonight? Or do you hate that sort of thing? - No, I don't hate that sort of thing. I'm just not sure I can celebrate all this. - What do you celebrate? (chuckles) Well. Maybe I'll see you sometime. I hope you change your mind. (indistinct chattering) - [Radio Announcer] Six inches of fresh snow. 12 degrees at the top. Wind's at 40 miles per hour. Chill factor, minus 16 degrees. (mumbles) 114 inch base, 11 inches. Fresh Powder, 20 degrees at the summit. Cameron, 105 base, eight inches Fresh Powder. Icy conditions prevail Red Mountain. - Sure wish you could come tonight, Bud. - Oh I'd like to, David, but I better go across to White Ice station. My boys called me about some conditions. I weren't sure what they're talking about. The earliest I could get back is tomorrow. - Hey there's Mark Elliot. Excuse me, Philip. Mark, good to see you. - David. Well it's good to be here. - Well come on, let's get you settled. Sammy, would you get Mr. Elliot's luggage please, room 509. It's great, isn't it? Gonna do a little skiing while you're here? - I'll try. (chuckles) When does your TV crew arrive? - Noon tomorrow. - Oh good. Is Scott here? - Everybody's here. - Great. - Including your wife. - Tina's here? - She arrived with Scott this morning. Nobody knew she was coming. - Kinda surprised. Couple of months, that's a long time for Bruce. As a matter of fact, it's a long time for Tina also. - Yeah, well I'm embarrassed. - Well there's no reason. - And. She'll be sitting at our table tonight. With Bruce. - That's showbiz.

You got a terrific accident yet you're still personal with the people you talk to. - You hear that? I'm gonna have to kiss you for that.

(chuckling) - What? - David is staring at Susan the more he stares at me. - Does it bother you? - No. It liberates me. - Do you ever have a really bad fall? - Not since I was 15. A fantastic instructor taught me the art of falling. - Did he ever explain, when you're sure you're not falling and you know you can't stop it. You just have to go with it. - He taught me never to resist. - Aloha! - Mother, this is not Hawaii. - It is if I say so. - You have to decide how to land. - You mean the position of your body? - Right, position of the body is very important. - I rather like it on my back. - Sideways (mumbles). - You fall sideways? - Makes for a change. - Far out.

You must be tired of all this crap. It took us years to grow up. - About whom are you speaking? - What's going on, I only asked you to dance. - You didn't ask me to dance, you told me to dance. You got to run the whole show. You panic if you haven't got complete control. It's always the same thing. I got to the point where I didn't know what I felt about anything. - I just want to be with you. What's wrong with wanting to be with you, or you wanting to be with me? - You stifle me! I need some space, I need some room. I've gotta make my own decisions. Just leave me alone. - I don't wanna leave you alone. - Well that's a problem I can solve. - Caroline!

Ugh. Yeah Marty, what? I don't care about your pilot in those weather conditions, I want you and that file on a plane up here tonight. No, Marty, you. Not the National Guard or the Marine Corps, you, and that file in your hot little hands. Marty! We are talking about a 10 year multi-million dollar project and you are telling me about clouds. Well give another $500, see how his vision improves. (water splashing) (soft piano music) - Nick? (wind blowing) (soft piano music) - [Radio Announcer] News from Colorado and the west. A blizzard that hit southwestern Colorado last night is nearly over. (engine running) (helicopter whirring) - Good morning! How do you feel? - Pretty good. - Sleep well? (sighs) I want you rating that on a scale of 10. Seven? Eight? Nine? Was she that good? - Tina, either put that apple down or throw it at me. - It wouldn't hurt you enough if I threw it. - My ass hurts enough already. Jealousy's the biggest pain in the ass. - God damn you! Stop acting as if you didn't get away with anything, you son of a bitch! - This is what you usually threaten to kill yourself. - I'll cut you to shreds, you bastard! - Why can't you play it the way your husband plays, he's got real style. - Stop it! (Tina screaming) - (mumbles) Kill yourself. (Tina crying) (screaming) - No, no, no, no. (crying) No, no. (crying) No. (wailing) I love you too. - Tina. Please. (wind blowing) - There he is! - Morning, lady. Have you seen Caroline this morning? - No. - Oh. Well, I gotta get the world rolling. Wanna come along? - What? - I'm going to work with the wonders. Do you wanna watch? - What are you going to do, freeze the Red Sea? - (chuckles) For you, anything. - But not outdoors. - Next year, indoors. - Give me a little bit. - Hey. - Don't you drink too many of those things. - Right on! (engine revving) (indistinct chatter) - [Announcer] We're just about to start our first event. The first international snowmobile invitational, featuring the Norwegian nutcracker.

All the way to (mumbles). (cannon blasts) (dramatic orchestral music) (indistinct chattering and cheering) - Woo! Thank you. Thank you, folks. All right. All right. Well now that you've cut the ribbon, Bruce, I feel that it's only appropriate that you be the first man up. (crowd cheering) One. I really don't wanna test it. (crowd laughs) And two, I mean it's quite obvious from your record that you need some kind of a head start. I feel like Bruce Scott is one of the finest athletes in the world. (crowd cheers) His skill and dedication to skiing have brought a new kind of excitement and given a very special meaning to (mumbles). I just like to say for all your friends up here, Bruce, and all your friends all over the skiing world that we owe you a great deal. (crowd cheering) - Mark, thank you. Let's go up the slopes! (crowd cheering) - Hey Bruce! - Ella. - Can we have your autograph? - Sure, ladies. - All right. (indistinct crosstalk) - Right up on a chair-- - Right? - I think you're gonna bring a lot of pleasure to a lot of people. - I now wanna thank everybody for making all of this possible. Have a good day. (crowd cheers) (frantic orchestral music) (crowd applauds) - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. - Good morning. (soft music) (audience clapping) (audience cheers) (suspenseful orchestral music) - You did great. That was really great. - Thanks.

(ominous music) - Stay here and watch Mommy and Daddy speed down. - And finally, we have the 10th (mumbles) who are patrons of the Colorado Cup. (audience cheering) Well ladies and gentlemen, this new lift is now officially open. So let's do some skiing! How 'bout it, pal? Gonna go up? Miss Courtney! Is it all right? - Well if you really want to! - And on, heh. Well, I'm Mark, who are you? - Jason. (suspenseful music) (soft orchestral music) (audience clapping) - Mr. Shelby I've made this trip 100 times. It's never been this bad. - Could we have flown past? - [Ed] No, I'm scared we're a lot closer than we wanna be. (soft orchestral music) (audience applauding) (suspenseful music) - What does this mean? - [Ed] We're losing power. Our fuel's starting to fluctuate. - Ed, find a place to sit this thing down. (suspenseful music) - How old are you? - 16. - Got an ID? - Uh-huh. - [Man] See you at the bottom when I get down. (indistinct crowd chatter) (suspenseful music) (crashing into snow) (explosion blasts) (suspenseful music) (rocks rumbling) - Look there's Bruce Scott!

(ragged breathing) - How's it feel? - I think it's okay. - What are you doing up here? - I was on my way up here, worried about that crazy thing when it broke. - With an air plane that started to slide. Looks bad. - All right look, if you get down there, the rink, I'll get the hotel. As quick as you can, yeah? - You bet. (grunts) (soft music) - Both doors are jammed. (grunts) - Oh terrific. (plays piano notes) Ah. Hey! - Gas.

There may be some people trapped. - Outside. - Some guy's working on that right now. - Right, have you seen my mother, where's Caroline? - No but David, there's a gas leak in the kitchen, it may be going into the dining room. - [David] Well then we get the boilers going full blast. - David, the power is out. - Steve, I want you to take whoever you need, get up the last rig, work on that back up generator.

He can't be! (alarm blaring) - [Man] We'll take the snow caps. - Come on, grab ahold. - It's slipping. I've got it. - Come on boys, we've got no time to lose. (engine turning over) Come on. Come on guys, hurry up. Move it! (suspenseful music) - It's gotta run like clockwork, guys. You and you, start getting the net out. Virgil, get us as close as you can. Get right under and be ready to move. Now let's go. (suspenseful music) - I can't hold it-- - Just hold on. No, no, no, no, Jason. Hold on, hold on, sweetheart. Easy, easy. Now listen to me, listen to me carefully. You see that there's a net down there? - Yeah. - Okay, now, all you have to do, you just have to, you just have to close your eyes and just jump and they're gonna catch us, all right? - I don't want to. - I think that this is gonna be the only way down right now. Because I'm a little more scared than you are, would it be all right if you jump first? - Yeah. - I'm gonna come right down after you, okay? - You promise? - Oh yes. Oh I promise. (line snaps) Okay!

We had to turn around but we sent the plows out last street. - Do you have Mrs. Shelby in there? - No sir, she's in the lead unit. - Do you know if she got through? - [Bearded Man] The radio there headed toward this bridge. - Nick, let's go! - Yeah.

(grunts) (ominous music) (helicopter whirs) (soft music) Good and chilled. - How is he? - He's all right, considering. He's a fighter. - Yeah, my God. Look at this place. - Yep, take years to reclaim it all. I'm glad you were here. It was important. - Yeah, thanks. - I like you. Just the way you are. - Take care of yourself, huh? - Goodbye, Caroline. (soft piano music) - [Caroline] Hi. - Hi. I have nothing to say. - Would you like some champagne? - Sure. What shall we drink to? - We survived. - Yeah. We survived. And I always thought survival meant being king of the mountain. (cork pops) Well. How is this for a quiet elegance? - Nice view. (mumbles) - I do have something to say. I caused all of this. I am responsible. - You've never said that. David, I love you. - [David] I know. - A lot. - Thank you, my friend. - I have to go. - Of course you do. (soft music) (soft orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music)
