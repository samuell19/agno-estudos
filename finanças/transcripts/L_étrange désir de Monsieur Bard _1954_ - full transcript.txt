AVIGNON Dear gentlemen, they do so... Ladies and gentlemen, yes. At the hotel in Avignon everyone dances. At the meeting in Avignon everyone dances in a circle. Not only on the charming song of childhood, but on all the bridges of the world, on all the bridges of the world, gentlemen dangle, dame ladies in half-turns and jumps. From burning sands to eternal ice cream... From antiquity to modern times, everyone dances to spend time between the 1st and 3rd window. These 3 windows can be found on all of the mayors. BIRTHDAYS, WEDDINGS, DEATH One day, for some unknown reason, we appear on the ground... and for some unknown reasons we leave her. From the beginning until the end of this trip, dear gentlemen and ladies dances to spend time between the windows. They do it like this... and yes. They do it... and this... But dangling, they all feel that time is low, that time is running out, That our life is so short. So you have to dance faster. Run faster! Faster! Faster and more intensive! Even more intense! You have to drive on destiny! You have to win, win, win. Win every price! You have to catch up on the fly... this rare bird... blue bird... which we call happiness. You went to the land of dreams. They all are sure that they will find a happy number. But they forgot that each turn of the wheel it approximates them to the final stop, up to the 3rd window. Excuse me... we have a small technical problem. Something wrong? It hurts so much? Who are you? What is your name? Bard... Auguste Bard. It is not yet at the end of the journey. He will sit behind the steering wheel and will lead the bus towards the composition of illusion and hope. And what is his hope... his path, his story? What is his dance? Let's follow him. ChodŸmy. MICHEL SIMON YVES LENIAUD IN THE FILM BEAUTIFUL CHANCES FOR LORD IN OTHER ROLES Breathe. G³êbiej. Slower. Tungsten. You can get dressed. Electrocardiogram. - Do you have children? - No. - Are you married? - With a goblet like mine? - Do you smoke a lot? - A package, half a day. You have to quit. And to quit means to definitely end this. Even 3, 4... 1, 2... No alcohol, tobacco and coffee. And do not give in to emotions. Do you work? I'm a casino driver. Abandon the job immediately. It can meet you on a bus with 30 passengers. - What? - Nothing special. It can happen to everyone. We are all mortal. Even doctors. Death is a disease that we do not know about the medicine yet. We are all deadly sick. Please. It takes a lot, a lot of rest. It depends on you how long you will pull. Goodbye. This way, please. Next. OUTPUT FUNERAL ACCOMMODATION WE WILL FORWARD ALL FORMALITIES You have to quit. It depends on you how long you will pull. Watch out, gamoniu! For a driver, something wrong with you! Part! How are you? Auguste, I've prepared you the "eleventhree". You can drive. What did he say? Canceling! And what did he say? Already for me. - Did he say that? - I can die anytime. You see it yourself. I told you not to go. If you listen, you will get sick immediately. It is true. Sit down. I can not work. If it happens to me at the steering wheel... With a cage like yours, you can make all of us fail. If I listened to them, I would hang myself a long time ago. The doctor stays with the sick when he sees a boy like you decided that something is not here! You're nice. Did you give me medicine? Only this. He writes like a claw with a chicken. What is written here? I have no idea. The worst thing is that I can neither drink nor smoke, or work. - What did I leave? - Mr. Auguste, where is my dad? Danielle, honey. Come here to me. What did you bring me? - What do you have there? - Rabbit. - You set him up? - No mum. Oh, there is an apple! Take them. You are very polite. Hold. Now you can bask in the sun, for us We will work like wears. You will eat yourself every day, morning and evening such a steak at the expense of your family. They are losing you. - You spent so many years giving them your salary. - I'm going home. Leonce comes out at two. Replace me. I'll go to the office. - See you tomorrow then. - How is it until tomorrow? On fish, as usual. Yesterday I caught such a perch. Well, maybe one. Goodbye! Cholera! - And? - A kilo of orange. - I have the best at the market. - Please, help me. - No. Please. - How much behind her? That's all for today? Buy yourself there. They are nicer. A good choice. They are really beautiful and fresh! - What else? - That's all. What's for you? I'm sorry, Mr. Bard, but I do not often have an opportunity to see Beatrice... Were you in the hospital? What did they tell you? - What's with him? - Is tired. PI ¥ TEK, 6 MARCH I can not work anymore. Apply for a pension. - How high? - Social minimum. - What? - Social minimum, Not to die of hunger. I am also ill, but I work, although I do not want to. Who has? But everyone has something to eat. - You want to fill the "tickle". - What? "Twang!" Your cash in the store... I was caught again. Forsa cuts you and destroys your liver. But you will be still 100 years old, and I... What are you going to do with your subsistence minimum? - Nothing. I will give you back. - Sure. Do you think that we will take you for it? It depends on you. Having care, I will spend some more time. But wait... - What does he do in the sideboard? - In the cupboard? Do not pretend to be a fault! Instead of giving away money, ... you keep them for yourself! - Brzdęk! - Thief! - Think about his liveriness! - It's just an excuse! - Beatrice, bring the eggs! So that's it? Are you all against me? Wait, you thief! Have not you finished yet? Hurry! Z³odziej! Everyone is thieves! And you are the greatest! Everyone steals, they are all thieves! Z³odzieje... But it hurts, oh, how it hurts! Stop jęczcze! It will not help you! Believe in my situation. I have never suffered so much! - Drink it! - Help me? And how do you think? Get ready! Do you know how much it will cost us? - Do not talk, just drink! - He is so much... It's because of your family, your uncle and cousin! I'm nice family! These were the messages of "Trybuna Paryska", on the air of national broadcasting. Responsibility for opinions expressed in "Trybuna Paryska", radio-listeners are carried out. It is not fun to be alone. So I thought I thought and I do not understand anything anymore. - What do you want to understand? - Everything. I mean what? He said even doctors have to die. - Is it bothering you? - No. I understand that, ... everyone must die. - What you do not understand? It's hard to say. I wonder why we came to the world. A few glasses and pipes, a robot, 30km to the left, 30km to the right and this is supposed to be life? Yeah. So what is there to worry about? But people are enough. They are satisfied. They must have seen something that raises their spirits. - What? - Hope. I hope for luck. They clung to her like a fish on your hook. They want to be happy. No matter how, but happy. And what they do? Some pretend that it would be enough to be loved. Have you met this? No. Not me either. It's just that I have it somewhere. I used to think like that too... but since I know that soon... I think about it... because I know I do not have much time. What would I want, if I know... maybe this... That someone loves me... Are you laughing? I 25. Total 400. Thank you. Good-bye, Olivier. Julie, I'll be right back. Let's go, Mr. Chanteau. Your idea can solve all problems. But you have to arrange it with him diplomatically. You better talk to him. I am counting on you. Yes? Can we come in? Please, Mr. Chanteau. Sit down. - You know Mr. Chanteau? - No. The best entrepreneur in the area. What a modesty! When I bought milk, I told him about you. It has a great idea. But yes! Please explain to him. I told you, Ernest, That you could ask for your own capital. - My capital? - Yes. - There is a queue at the checkout! - Please explain to him. I'm going now. Instead of a monthly retirement, the casino can pay you one-off capital at once. Twang! Precisely! Please do not say that you are a heartbeat. Not only would you pay interest, but also pensions. Julie, the queue next to vegetables! With such capital, you can buy something and multiply it. Tornier's pastry shop can be bought for 300,000. Small croissants to keep customers, and after a month to go to margarine and slowly give less and less. - We'll make coconuts. - You have lots of ideas! The doctor only told you to rest. In the morning you will count napoleons, tarts, meringues, eclairs, and in the evening, what will stay. That's all. And when it stops pikaæ, the patisserie will continue to sell napoleon... It is obvious. Mr Bard's heart will turn into a tortoiseshell (cake with cream and jelly), and the deal will be curbed, huh? - Pretty good idea. - You see, what are your options... Wait a minute. Do not interrupt yourself. Mr. Bard, interest is business. I have a great relationship with the casino management. I'll take care of everything. I will do more than you. You need to know how to approach the matter. Since it will please you... As for me, I will take only a small commission. 10 %%. Agreement? On behalf of the management of our enterprise and as a representative of the supervisory board, we are glad to see you as a reliable co-worker... who has been a great and loyal servant for 25 years with dedication he transported to our company impatient crowds looking for us fortune and happiness. - Please. - Thank you. - Goodbye, Mr. Bard. - Goodbye sir. Good luck. - 25 years of great service. - I can take care... No. I will take care of this. - Please. - Thank you. - Thank you. - What are you doing? Auguste, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Gentlemen, you can not take it! Gentlemen, call the police! Call the police! Please give it away immediately! - Zero? - Yes. You've heard? No more with a pastry shop, Napoleons... - Zero. Goodbye. - Please take the money. - What? - You won 350000! - How is it? - You won! Wygra³eœ! He won! - Whose "Zero"? - Ours! Wait a minute! Take your hands! I'm not here to win! - Here you are! - Black? - Yes. ¯ałoba for 24 hours. - Please, do not listen to him! He was crazy. You wanted to turn me into a Napoleon, calmly wait until I stretch my legs and take over the business. - 26, pair, "passe", black. - You understand? This is the end. - Goodbye. - You won! - Black 1150000. - 10 %% for me. Leave it! I'm not here to win. Everything. - 13? Everything on 13? - Yes all. I'm sorry, but you've exceeded the limit here. - How is it? - Too much. - Can I somewhere else? - Of course. Everything on 13! Everything on 13... - Everything's okay. - Please, do not listen to him! He has heart disease! He can die at any moment! Gentlemen, we're not in the hospital. - 13, Black, odd. - 13, Black, odd... My God! Auguste! Wygra³eœ! Wygraliœmy! Come on, my little one! Let's collect money! Collect... I do not want to. Why do I need it? I do not need it! I'm not here to win! I want to lose it all, understand? Przegraæ! 25 million and 43 thousand francs! Instead, we can buy a pastry shop, bakery, meat shop, grocery store, the whole street of Victor Hugo! On the whole length of the street the customer will leave money in the ticket office. I also thought about the clothing store and household appliances. You're the smartest in the family! What do you think? And I mean "Shit!" How is "Shit"? It's not your money. - They're yours, and that's the same. - They are not mine. This money belongs to God. - God has no money. - But he has... God keeps money in hand, To pay off debts because it is honest. You understand? - No. - It is very easy. When I was born, good God was somewhere else... and he could not take care of me. You see what the result is. - Not very successful. - Very successful, Auguste. You have so-called "smart ugliness" in you. Do not strain yourself. I have a mirror and I see myself every day. Good God sees me too. But he is just and he wanted to fix everything. Please. What? Please? When the doctor announced that he would soon die, good God said: This poor Auguste can not die in this way. He was never happy no one ever loved him. So he wanted to fix it and give it to me. - Maybe someone will love me. - Love... Good yourself. He will love your millions, not you. Just look at yourself. You will never understand anything. You are like your money. You only understand: "Brzdęk". I'm not talking about a woman, just for someone who will love me, who will be happy when he looks at me, who will smile at me. I want someone to love me. I want to have a child. What? Yes, I want to have a child. Good night. Yes? - Can you come in? - Hello, Mr Bard. I talked to Julie that night. We said to ourselves: "Sure, he's right. He has the right to be happy. It's his money. I want to have a child. It's natural." So we said to ourselves: "We will help him." Mr. Chanteau came for milk in the morning, we talked and he thinks that too, right? It's a family matter, but you're right. There's a way... get into Beatrice. He is penniless, but you have too much. She is innocent. You can give birth to such a child! Strong! In a month, for a wedding, let's give an announcement, then a contract... You'll write her everything. The whole of what you have. In the event of death, the fall will not be taxed. - And Maurice? - What kind of Maurice? - Fiancé. - Maurice does not count. He will become the manager. You will leave on a honeymoon trip. You will have one, two, three children, whatever you want! And we'll take care of the shops. - And Beatrice? - What about Beatrice? - What is Beatrice for? - What? We have arranged everything! She is delighted. Come on, you'll talk. - And what did you say? - Ernest! Think about the liver. - Do not you unfold the rod? - No. Show the photo. I got them at the agency. There were other, but it was old. Well, they are not nice. - How are you? - Yes, that's right. You must know what you are looking for. At agencies ... they want to know the details. - I do not know. I would like, That they would be ³adne. It's not about me. I have it somewhere. - It's about balance. - A woman is like a plague, and a pretty woman is choking. You want it, you'll have it. Let's go to the beach. Mom... Detriment. You will never find it because you know what you want. You do not understand because you were not a father. Oh no! To have a child, you need to take care of the mother. Before, during and after. And then there are endless problems. Oh, no, this system does not suit me! - Look! - For what? On it. - Where? - On the bus. Did you bounce? It's empty. Because he dances. He reminded me of her bus. She is an artist in a casino. Let's go to her. Do you know her? I carried it almost every day. I have a long ticket. He never has money. Anything that he will earn denying, he will lose after five minutes. Gambler, showing the legs... it's hard for a better mother. It is not a sin that dances and plays. He simply earns money. - I want to live my life. - Are you interested in the passengers? Not at all. She told me about myself, waiting for the bus. It was at the bus stop. I want to go to South America. That's why she dances and plays. It's easy. What do you think? Nothing different for me. Let me? I'll give it back soon. This is very important. Third on the right. And what? Has a nice figure. Sport is good for circulation. After all, she is a dancer. I do not know, but I would be looking for a mother for someone else. Now it's undressed. You must see her dressed up. Then you will say. - Thank you. - Do you know where he lives? Paces. Six, black, even, - Same? - Yes please. Wait a minute. - Go, bold! - What should I say? I do not know. You are already grown up. Well, you're a big boy. I'll wait there. - 13, black, odd. - Same? - Enough for today. - I need to talk to you. - But... - No, that's not it... There is someone who knows you... No, please believe me. This is very important. Please do not be afraid... You do not recognize me? And, because I do not have a baseball cap. - It's about debt? You have bad luck. - But no... Contrary! It is about... Would you like to sit down... Please. - Do you fancy anything? - Never. - Very good. Are you smoking? - A lot. Well... it's worse. Can you... limit a bit? Why? - What do you want from me? - Open the package. Here's the proof that what you hear is not a piece. But no... it's not what you think. Well, you know... No, of course... you have to... that's not the point... You better not say anything... Please listen. It is very easy. He wants to have a baby, but he will not do it himself. So she is looking for a woman. That's all. You think that's a crazy idea, but... having children is not prohibited. Of course, I could adopt, but it's not the same. So please forgive me for thinking about you, but I wanted my mother to be beautiful. It's really beautiful. It's not about me, it's about the child. Do you understand? - I do not want to marry me. - I'm not going to die that much! I am not asking for something impossible. I do not want to ruin your life. All you need is to accept my request. It's about a few months to give birth to a child. Then you will be free. As you said at the bus stop in Nice, you will leave, wherever I want and he will never hear about us again. It's a fair offer. It's just about giving birth to a child, For women, there is nothing simpler than giving birth to a child. That's why they exist. He just wants to have a child who would love him. And that's enough for him to be happy. - And he does not think about anything else. - That's what I want. You told me how unhappy she was. Please understand me. I want to be happy. And at the same time make you happy. And a child. And that's what the money is for. I got them to give you. Child and lady. And you will create a new life, thanks to which he will start living. You will all start a new life. Three wins of life, instead of two lost. What do you say? That's true, we did not think about it... Pretty possible. Ask. I asked him if you're not busy. It is not free. Do you have someone? I'm alone. - Buy you something in the city? - Are you going to town? Tomorrow, Monday. I'm going to work. - Will you leave me alone? - You will not be alone. It's not? I found you this corner, I brought you here, Now you can do what you like. - If you leave, I'm going with you. - You need to know what you want. I want you to stay. You will take a vacation and you will be my chauffeur. - Buy a car? - For what? You are a chauffeur without a car. Doctors without the sick, they are still doctors. - No sick doctors. - It's the doctors who make the sick. You see? You must stay. I do not know a more annoying guy. - Father will forgive. - I forgive. Maybe we will play? I'm going now. Do not sit like this. You can not leave a woman alone. - What should I do? - I do not know. Ask her about her, bring her the orange, the flowers... Ask for health, not because it's a woman, but you could still be more gallant. You see? You must stay. I would not think about it. - ¯egnam, father. - Goodbye, Mr. Bard. There are so many marriages that are afraid of having children, and they want to have a child, but they are afraid of marrying. As husband, he would have little time, but he could still become a cuckold. A child is not a toy. To raise them, you have to create a home. - Now you are. - He has little time for that. - That's why she agreed? - But no. He does not know he is sick. He was afraid to tell her. - She's afraid of a woman. "She does not know women, anyway. You talk about them as about rattlesnakes. They are not so bad. Father also does not know them. Is it true what they write about the woman in the Bible? I am unbelieving, but Eve told Adam to eat an apple! Since then, men have had trouble with their stomachs. Because I love you... I love you to the madness... I love you so much... That I can not stop... But when... You will leave me... I will always love you... my love... no matter where, no matter how... I love you without memory... It's me. What are you doing here? Nothing. You want to ask me something again. I thought that if we can not sleep, - maybe we'll play in a belotk. - In the belotkę? This is how you intend to have a child: Mother on the one hand, father on the other playing the belotkę, and a thick wall between them? When will you finally fulfill your duty? What are you waiting for? You have no shame! Give me cards. - Trefl. - I'm coming. - No extra. - So play! Atu... Belotka... Belotka... I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry! It's not my fault. 10 points! - How many days is he gone? - Five. Did he say something before he disappeared? - I want to be happy. - Happy? An ordinary escape. This man is an adult. He is deadly ill. He can die at any moment. He packed 25 million into a newspaper and threaded it with a string. Maybe they killed him and lay in the water, strangled, cut into pieces... - Any casual acquaintances? - He has not had a woman for 30 years. He always said he was leaving the house. He was like a child. Like our child. You have no heart, Commissioner? Leave my heart. If something threatens him, we will deal with it. - Are you talking Bard? - How "bar" with "d" at the end? With "d" at the end. Auguste... 52 years. Special characters? Is... It's hard to say. How are you, baby? - Hello, boss. - Hello, Mr Bard. Big coffee with milk, ... bread, bread roll, butter... - Yes! Hello, priest. How are you? He is in a good mood. - I'm hungry. - He's hungry. - And how? - Done. - What? - You have to wait. - For what? - For a child. Did you hear the priest? After one night, I feel my father. He still believes in miracles. Are you not? No. - Do you hear? - I can not hear anything. They are cute. You think after 25 years of work in the garage, you finally found happiness? - We were so peaceful we were... - Mr. Bard? - At least the fish do not scream. - And what? Mom feels good. There should be no complications. - For sure? - In 7 months you will be a father. You are hearing a? In seven months... In 7 months I will be... What is? Paces. Please, sit down. Carefully. - What's with him? - Heart. Ok. I'm fine. Better? Seven months... that's long. Thank you. It's easy. It's for my son, it's for my mother, ... and that's for costs. - Is it a donation or a will? - I want to do my best. - Better will be a donation for a living person. The child is full-age? It will be 2 months. - Depends on how to count. - It was not yet born. - It complicates the matter. - That's why I need a notary. No changes if a girl is born If it's a girl... - You think it's going to be a girl? - Possible. I do not mind girls, but... they seem to be similar to fathers. - The girls are also nice. - Yes, when they are small. The director is waiting. In matters of payment, I must consult the supervisory board. I would like to pay for everything in advance... until the final exams. Here you are. I must first calculate. - Will my daughter learn Latin? - Latin? - I do not know. What do you think? - What for? After all, he will not be a priest or an altar boy. I will not learn Latin. It can be beautiful art... ... painting, music, piano... - Well, of course... And the harp? It will not be too difficult? Is the Harp so wonderful? We can find a teacher. He will be someone. Kimo! Good yourself. I'm sorry I'm interjecting but you do not teach cooking here, ... washing up the dishes... - I will not wash the dishes. - He will be a governess. - It will go stale. He is jealous because he has no children. All fathers are the same. - So we write it down? - Yes... I mean, I only saw the playground, and I want to see everything where I am going to be. You finish? Agreement. She will be fine here. What do you think? Sure. It is a drag! It will be in the middle! You have to do something about it. Antonio... Let's move there. At the wall. It does not blow here. It's easy. It will not be cold here. I can sit on the swing for a moment. I do not think it will fall. I assure you that she is not a madman. He is a preventive father. Your village is the only one in the world, which you can get only on the mule. - Tyłoek hurts? - Yes. We'll be right on the spot. Rub your backside. She'll do good to you. See the second house on the left, next to the church? It was in him that I was born. You see? And we came here for a cow, as if there were no cows! I want to have a cow that I trust. - A real cow. - Oh, true! - Others are not real, yes? - I do not know others. Rowing. For that I met your muses. Oh, my ass! Rowing! Give me this and that. - You take two? - Yes, what? You will be a competition for Ernest. You do not understand anything. The second one will be in reserve. From the milk of a sick cow, a toddler may get diarrhea. - You want to keep in stock. - You take two? What should I do? It's for my kid. Give them to me in April. To Ernest. Feed them well and, above all, do not overuse them. Here's your address. Goodbye Goodbye, pretty. Say well... is this something... Was it here when you were born? Yes, what? When your mother was pregnant, she came here for water? - It's the only fountain in the village. - Well, no wonder. It bounced in you. You are like her. Are you mocking? You did not hear it? If in the countryside they want the doe to have white youngsters, they put a white rag on the cage. - But it's not a doe. - No, but that's it nature is already here. You can not help it. What you know? You did not travel. Over a million kilometers. A million kilometers, but in a circle! You have not seen anything. Do you know why children are nice in Spain and Italy? Because their mothers see beautiful things around them. When they are pregnant, they see beautiful paintings, Madonna, angels, sculptures... It makes an impression on them. That is why their children are similar to all this. Just like you are like a fountain. Come, have a drink. Well. - You see them well? - Yes. - It's beautiful, right? - Yes. - I do not like it, I'll change it. - I like. Please always say what you like and what you do not like. - Are you hungry? - I just ate. You need to eat well... If you want something, please do not take a break. - Please do not refuse. - I do not refuse myself. You'd better look at him, not me. Also, do not read the newspapers. I asked you not to read them. Please, look. Same wars, murders... Everywhere, death... Poor God. There is no time to deal with the living. And our child. That's why you need to help him from time to time. Look at him, not at me. £ nice. He has nice eyes. He also has a nice mouth, but... nose... do I know? No, I'd like him to be upturned, look at the sky. I need to find my nose. It is in Italy. At the border he had to show a passport. He's ill. He should be with his family. - What he did with money - I do not know, but he is with a woman. - With a woman? - He got married? Not yet. His name is Donatta Francesca. And the police? There is no one to defend good people? - A trip with a girl is not a crime! - What a shame! It's his money. It can even make confetti with them. Confetti with 25 million... This madman is capable of everything. What did you say? - What did I say? - Something very important! Please, repeat this! - that he is capable of everything. - No, something else! - he is a madman! - Crazy? In the light of the law, it changes everything! The law respects the actions of healthy people. The signature of a madman has no legal effect. I do not understand you. If he is a madman, he has no right to dispose of money. Only the family council. - Let's decide he's crazy! - You can see with a naked eye! - It's his "stomach"... - He will be happy! He was giving away money. And fruits! Free! It's crazy! He squeezed me when he was leaving! It's not enough. This is supposition. You have to follow it, note it everything he says and does, collect evidence that indicates that it is not normal. You have to present it to the court ... and appoint a family council. - Immediately! I know an agency that has an office in Italy. Private police. - Record, listen and take pictures. - Well! It will cost you. I do not want to influence. You will do as you like... But it's worth sacrificing something small. You can not allow so much money issued so unreasonably. It's immoral! Immoral. I would like to see angels... Angeli. He knows, priest... - A, pigeon! - No... Angels who fly. He knows, priest... - Yes. - Come... Please... No. It is not it... I'm not looking for that. I want to find a nose... and the lips... - There. - Oh, there! Please, come here. I think I found it. Pretty good. Do you see that nose? Please, come here. At 2, 3 minutes. Please look at him for 3 minutes. How old are you? Coming soon 53. 3 years for sure. As for the rest, I have doubts. Nose... I'm looking. And how? Did you find anything? Yes, my nose, but I did not find a mouth. It's weird. There are not so many angel lips. Tomorrow we will go to the Capuchin monastery. The guy at the hotel said they had a lot of angels. Angels in the morning, noon, in the evening... When I told you about white rabbits, I did not know That we will be visiting all of Italy. I could shut up! - I'm hearing you because you're always right. - Watch out for her! You know what condition it is in. Give her a hand! My little one! They hurt you? It's good. Look, how nice. And what is the smile and nose? I'm looking for that exactly. Ask who it belongs to. Whose "bambino" is it? Is this Mrs. "Bambino"? And these? - What does he say? - They're all hers... "Bambino" to eat with me? Are you sure about him? - There's a bigger choice out there. - Exactly for him. Look. Look at the tip of his nose... as it rises towards the sky. I meant that for my nose. £ nice. And those eyes and lips. If it were possible to take dimensions. But he is like a pig. What are you interjecting? It's not your son. His father degenerates our civilization. Do not listen to him. He is jealous because he has no children. Do you want to play? - How is "playing" in Italian? - Nijak. After eating, the children rest. Well. I will take care of this. Come on, we sleep a little. Children are having fun. And the adults guard them. There was a small ship that never... We will leave it for tomorrow. Who never sailed... Now we'll go lulu... I'll sleep a little... Marynarzyk... Who is sailing the oceans... 8 days ago, the little began to move. Kick the feet. Everyone remembers. - I think I'm enjoying my life. - There is something to enjoy. It is true. I wonder if he will like what we will provide him. - Why not? - The child is not trading! I do not need contracts or notaries, only father and mother! Please talk to him about it. I'm not brave. Why? When I was small, I saw a man walking at night on the roof. Just the edge. I wanted to call him, but I was forbidden. Do not make him. He is sleeping. If you say something, it will fall. Because. Whether... would you be sorry if he fell? He takes children on his hands. Little is. He guides his concubine through museums, koœcio³ach. Looking for... What? He's looking for organs. Yes, bodies. Eyes, noses, lips It gives a lot of tips when someone gives him information. - Something like that! - Well, right. I wonder if he will find a doctor who will undermine this evidence. It's crazy! A real madman! Mr. Chanteau, I do not know how to thank you! It's easy. As usual. 10 %%. 10 %%! Wait, what 10 %%? 10 %% of the total sum. 10 %% of 25 million? Are you sick? - Yes, we agreed with Mr. Bard! - It's crazy! His findings are worth nothing. I am the head of the family. I decide and do not agree on percent! - So... I'm sorry. - What? Whar are you doing sir? Mr. Chanteau? What are you doing? I am asking you to calm down and sit down. Honest people will always come to an agreement. All you need is a bit of goodwill. On both sides. I do not miss her. I will never forget a difficult case one unhappy. Have you noticed something extraordinary? It was not strange, abnormal... - What, you crazy? - Not exactly... Did you start babbling? - What did she say? - you're crazy. - Why? - You do not know? I can already see you borrowing your child. Solve me. I liked this little one. 30. Total 200. Thank you and goodbye. Greetings to Mr. Chapoto! Julie. Shut. Dinner. They returned the day before yesterday. They are at the Bellevue hotel. - Are they married? - No. - He took a room for a mother with a child. - Children... ... pretty. - And you say it so calmly? - What, I have to cry? Yes, because this disaster fell into the trap of debauchery and squandering the family estate, and you let him do it! What have you paid for for half a year? What are the detectives doing, why have not they been closed yet? It's not so simple! You must have a warrant! - I think violence will happen! - Rape? No. You have to prove that he is brutal and dangerous. - Dangerous? - Good morning! Did you think I'm dead? That's true, I could send you a card. Good morning, Andre! What's with him? Did he bounce him? As usual, you have nice faces. Where's Beatrice? Are you scared of me? I have come in your case. In her? Is she married? Œor next week. It's good that I'm off. Hello, Caroline. Good morning, patron... Hello, Julie. - I will take your place for a moment. - It means, ... that you think about it? - Yes. How is your "pound" opened? This is my retirement. I thought: If they want her so much, I will give them to them. This will be dowry Beatrice. Well? She will be able to buy a confectionery. Please. I want you to be happy like me. - And what did you do with the rest? - Do not touch me! - Where are the millions? - I've already explained to you. They are neither yours nor mine, only my child. - My child? - Already? Not yet, but... but it will be soon. Yes. It is furnished up to the wedding, and even a little after. Everything signed, initialed... All the signatures of a madman are not valid! Cancel it! - Go to the attack! - What crazy? You! In Italy you were looking for noses and ears. - You have to help God a little. - Do you hear? Help God! Write it down! He was crazy! You have to be a madman to choose your mother ... baby bitch! - A whore? And it's the biggest! - We know you paid for it. - Not the first and not the last. We already know who she is. Maybe it's not your child. Maybe a friend. Honeymoon in three... You do not have... You do not have... You have no right! Madman! Help! It's crazy! Call the police! I want to demolish the store! - Do not get close. - Catch him! What are you waiting for? Call him off! Get out of here! That's crazy... Is that where Mr. Bard lives? You... Bard... Hide! - We're leaving town soon. - Where are we going? Far from here. It's crazy! For you crazy in fury is normal! If you locked him on the border, we would not come here! No. It was not visible after him that he was obliterated! And now you see? No? And you let him escape! Maybe he's murdering someone now, ... or putting fire to the casino! - Ernieście, ... watch out for the liver. - We'll catch him, but I warn you if it hurts, the family must pay for it! You are like children! If the police come here, ... where will you go? - Next... Dok¹d? Do you want to run away with this woman all your life? You've made a lot of trouble. You made plans for God. I told you how to ask a clever man: Please think about your plans. But a man who feels happy is dumb. What should I do? There is an exit. You must attack. Do you understand? No. Even if you do not catch... We are all mortal. One day God will call you. Then prove that you were a madman, cheated by a woman. They will undermine the documents, will, everything! And the law will grant them the right. The female child and woman... mother of a child, they will be fooled. Do you want this? I do not like to swear, but the priest is right. So when I die after my death... The bastards. Please say. Are you crazy? No. Simply, instead of running away, you have to confirm it, medically and legally. You will enter a cage with lions. - With lions... - You will come to your own wish. You will go to a psychiatric clinic of your own will and tell the doctors: Please tell me if I'm crazy or not. You'll go through the research, ask questions, and you will answer politely. As at school. Until one day they write: "Mr. Bard is not crazy." It's enough, To protect the relatives of our relatives from evil intentions, even if one day, you will not be able to defend them. Do you understand? I would go in your place. - Will you take care of her? - Sure. - In that case... - You have to leave the car until morning. If you want, I can... come for you tomorrow... or the day after tomorrow. I will go with you. I must say goodbye to her. Wait for me downstairs. Goodbye. He wanted to be happy. What... I need to... It's about the court, about the medical certificate, about the law. I need to go to a psychiatric clinic... where they put crazy people. Are you afraid? I do not think you're... I do not know a more reasonable man than you. That's why I'm afraid. I'm afraid of people. Maybe these people will not understand you. They must understand. It's their profession. If you do not go there and give them money, leave you alone? When I get money, I will not be crazy anymore Give them to me. What? This money. A child? I do not need money, only you. And Mrs... everything we discussed... your new life in South America... I need your money there. I know that we've agreed something else... it's hard to explain... on the one hand, you, on the other, nothing simpler... but now, with him... he needs you and me. And we need him. I do not know if we can live separately... but maybe it would be best... try to solve this situation just like that three of us... together. You can not count on me. I think I told you... I do not have a sick head, just a heart. Yes. He can stop beating anytime. And you did not tell me? You do not trust me. I trust... but people do not like death... Neither death nor those who will die. Sorry to think about it. In your condition, I did not want to worry you. In my state... you have to think about you! You have to go to the doctor! Doctors... I do not live for them anymore. I live because I have to live some more. But this money is on later. I can not give them. If God gave me a gift... it's because I have little time. When he asks me... And the money I gave you for this little one, what did you do with them? At that moment, you do not talk nonsense. I have to say that I gave it to Ernest, because I was scared? What will he think about me? I thought that everything was prepared... and I have to do something else. But it will not take long. I'll be back. AND... If you still want, we'll try... manage yourself in a three. Together. But first and foremost, please... do not torment, just smile. Always smile... Goodbye. NEUROPS YCHATIC GUIDE Only nerves. Easy and polite as in school. You answer questions and then sit quietly. Ides. What did you do in Italy, did you walk? No, actually... I will be a father, true... I took my mother there... I have heard that if she will give birth to beautiful things Nice child. To help God a little, as you say? You need to help him a little. You are right. If everyone did that, we would be beautiful!
