A little shooting, little killing, little burning down, little organizing. By the way, about your cigarettes, that was an act of God. Anythmg else'? I mean do you have any other practical advice right now'? It's like in your papers. What does that mean, "your" and "yours '7 "You"? That means You, the elder ones. You should better shut up. And think back. Think. - About what? Look at the two of us. You are older. I don't know how old you are. But you belong to those, who saw the catastrophe commg and still made it happen. We could not know back then, we were simple-minded lads. And now'? Now you sit in your office chair, you are the mayor, you survey the order. And I, we'? Ready to rot. No start, no aims, rejected. Used up from the beginning. You are seeing all this rnuch to primitive. - But clear! Stefan Kolb, one has to pay for mistakes. So'? for mistakes, which I did not commit? What's the use of breeding out revenge now'? To figure out who has the real guilt? We have to make a new start. All of us! Wlthout start, there is no ending, Kolb. Watch out. I know these calendar lines. Do something, without education, use ones hands and legs, shovel and spade and so on. Yes, a fresh start, let's begin. Rététété!

Butt hat is impossible, you cannot leave the child up there. Please. Okay, go. Stefan! Sepp! - Leave him. Such a bridge is rnuch easier blown up than build . How many meters to get over there? 20, 25. That's another typical case of exploitation. Besides we cannot handle this alone. l_et's go, password "railway station"! We'll do it. What? You don't really want to... - Of course I want. Sure, we'll do it. - You shut up! You need to do calculations, golly, drawings...

How many, do you think, you will be needing in addition? Men'? It depends on how quick the bridge, shall be finished. As quick as possible. VVe provide food and lodging, and of course I am always there for you. Yes, and we have to talk about the other thing as well. Here, about the dough. Yes, of course, you need dough to built and construct. Well, I am very glad. I'll arrange the barracks ln the former POW-camp for you. I have time in the evening. I will help too! - That is good! One more thmg. - What is it'? About the other night. I still carry the handcuffs. Oh. Okay. I will help you. Send in Erwin'? Erwin! Mister Lukas wants to see you. Vvas it right to start this without anything written down and sealed? Please, come wlth me nght away Please. Looks lovely. It's dripping, put it down. Sit down here. - Ah, that is what you mean.

Because you greeted me so spontaneously. I know you very well, Herr Kolb. - Very well? Gosh! Come on, from where. Later. We'll flx the bandage now. No, no, no, don't do it. You would be to scared. I think, you are scared. I will be very careful. Fréulein, please give me at least an Aspirin. I told you, to wait outside. This is a sirnple thing. - I think so. These are hardly the right instruments for this. You undereshmate us. - Well? What mstrument do you suggest? Here! Okay, Fraulein, now let the specialists handle this. Okay, young. Sepp, hold it! I organized the saw. You know where? I can imagine. - Great guy, hm? One moment, please? One ls vveanng a handcuff. - I know. And they are just removing it. - l-low is he going to get rid of them now? I send them the saw myself. I hope you Wont get in any trouble with them. I don't think so. I rely on my feeling for faces. I have to glve them a chance , do you understand? That is he least thing, that I can do for you. You have to hold on fight, then it doesn't hurt the flesh. Hau ruck! Hau ruck! Hau ruck! If we go on like this, we will be over in three weeks. For eight days now, my office has been receiving anonymous letters, concerning these four guys. You are ln charge, Herr Lukas. Yes, Mister Unitary director. I take full responsibility. VVhat did the district administrator want'? - Nothing. He is happy, that you are building the bridge. Take you lunch break now, good-bye. - Good-bye, Herr Lukas. Cor-me on, Peter, I go into the water. Food is not here yet. You're commg wlth me'? - Okay, lets go swim. Hello, Fréulein Sierras!

That seems to become a real bridge. What did you think? To be honest, I did not really believe in it. That will be a real bridge just wait and see. Here, look at thls. That's what it looks like, when it is ready. Yes, Fresener format. You know, I always thought, that there ls somethmg special about bridges. When I was a boy and I crossed a bridge on a train, the sound of the bridge under my legs, it's funny, how somehmes you suddenly know what you want to do. - Why'? Is building bridges yourjob'? - Job? Yes, I wanted, intended to . Had no time. But now it starts. Very nice. Come wlth me, I'll show you everything. But I have no hme! - Just a couple of minutes. See, thls ls ,where my new life starts.

I an': not going any further. - It's not going any further. Now take your cigarette, and then I have to go back. Thank you. Do the others have too'? - Yes, everybody. Do you have to go to the mayor agam'? - No, Doktor Warnschaffel. Whom are you workmg for'? Doktor Warnschaffel or Lukas? Why'? From time to time I help I\/lr.Lukas with his private work, during finishing time. Someday he wants to leave from here. You too'? Stefan, food gets cold! - Yes, I'll be right there! Please , don't leave yet. Can you imagine, how happy I feel sitting next to you, after all the crap'? Isn't it funny, Sepp. As soon as you get out of bed and stuffed your stomache, the treadrnill starts again. Get on the bridge, Luise... Shut up! Do you always have to look at all things in a negative attitude? Bye the way I must go now. Help me please. To bad. Careful! About tonight? Wont you come down to see us, we will play some music. Sepp is very happy about his harmonica. Did he say "thank you" already? Of course. - Well, what do you say'? Are you coming'? O rare you working with Lukas again? No. No, but I an': going to bed early tonight. Good bye. Good bye. Enjoy your meal, Fraulem Slems. - Mahlzeit. Do not forget your chaperon. - Thank you. Lukas, is it you'? - No, it's just me. Stefan Kolb. Why dldn't you come'? - Please, don't be so loud. Come on! - This is such a nice evening. Would be a shame to fall asleep. Be nice. Get dressed and come down. Let's take a walk along the river, okay I will behave for sure You are just imagining that. - No, I an": sure. I feel like an angel myself already. An angel with handcuffs. That's what I wanted to talk to you about You have a totally wrong image concerning me. Please, you go home now. Fréulein Sierras, wait Just a minute! For a cigarette length. Qulet! But you must promlse that you leave immediately after that. Yes, okay, I promise. One feels so god damn lonely. Do you have a match? I have a lighter. Thank you. Hello!

Went, I come down, and show you. She is corning down, she is coming down... Here I am. There! - Ah, I see. Thank you. It was very nice of you to come down here. Just the cigarette, then I will be leaving again. Wont you slt down'? Let's arrange it now. - Okay. Very nice. The old monastery garden ls really wonderful. - Oh, yes. Please. - Thank you. What are you gomg to do, when the bridge will be ready built. Devil knows. But you seer-med so optimistic this morning? Yes, but if you think about it over and over, you keep staring at misery. Where hes the future for me and the others, if this is over'? - Not back to the railway station for sure. L-low this is going to end you could Witness before. - VVe are no criminals. If not thls tlme, then next time. It depends on the details very often. You still do not believe me, do you'? We are no villains. Our only misfortune was that we stayed alive. My god, how old are you'? - 27. And you haven't done anything for immortality. Then why dont you do something now'? You can not go on living like this, awaiting whatever comes or doesn't come. Till it's too late. Take Lukas as an example. Think about, What life did to him. But he is really busy, isn't he'? Always busy? He's got someone, he is not alone. Are you a man, or a kid'? A Kid with stubble-beard. Moment, quiet. Okay, ready. In about ten weeks, you will be a tolerable creature for women. At least your face. - Thank God, I need it.

Kurt! Do you Want to stay in hicksville forever? Of course not! I thought about it a lot. A life like this, surrounded only by rnen maybe nice. But What I Went through since school was a bunkers life. Mentally and physically. And then came the blg march home, where the real life was happening. Not a nice one, but life. But you walk around and feel like a stranger. You don't know the language. Because you did not learn it. It ls a shame, to look at the thmgs one hast lost, lost forever. If everyone shares your opinion, then we will always stay without luck. You could help me. - What can I do'? If you are so desperate and without bravery yourself. I need someone by my slde, do you understand? Gives me back my strength. I need you! I know, that everythmg may turn out well, if you stay with me. I knew it from the first day. You are really a grownup little boy, Stefan Kolb. Edith. Edith? I am here. Okay? VVhat is it, Edith'? - Nothing. I thought, you were ln your room and... - No. Ijust... - Good evening. Good evening, Kolb. I Went to take a look at the bridge, this afternoon. Advancing very fast. I tned to come earher, but Warnschaffel treated me so long.

Help, Peter, come here! Mice! Not a word to Stefan! Understood? What's the matter, Usseken'? Why are you screaming? I think there are mlce here. - They wont harm you. Come down, it's okay. You can say, whatever you want, I wont stay here, and neither will you. I turn on alight now and then there is no reason for you to be afraid. Say, what's the thing about the railway station? Which station? Come on. The murderer! They questioned you too. They presented a letter to me, which I had written to you. You know, the one agned: "An Ace in your heart". Shit! They found my belongings in the tunnel. That's nght, my dear. But you don't keep such letters, anyway. And what did the police say about me'? They do not say anything. They just ask questions. I can tell you that it was not very comfortable. I spend two days in there. Then I came out and you were not there. And there was no money. LVlabe has some. At least for travelling. Who ls Mabel? - Well, Mieze Dickmann. Oh. VVe have nothing to do with, What happened at the railway station. All of us. Then why are you here, mon cher'? I know you. - Oh, really!

Come with me, yes'? Say yes! Edith? I have been looking for you everywhere. I was worried about you. You are packing? Yes, Lukas. lthmk, it is better that way. No. We are gomg together. I arranged everything. I just wait till the bridge will be ready. You want me to go wlth you'? Before you know, what became of your wife? Edith, I love you. Everything else belongs to the past. Uniorgotten past. Stefan, What are they going to do with the dead soldiers? They will be buried at the village cemetery, you know. My goodness, it Wont VVOFK this way! VVe need more helping hands! Where ls Peter? - I don't know. Of course, whenever he is needed. Now come on, Fatty! What is it'? It ist he pile driver. They are using the pile driver. So'? Just wanted to mention it. Don't talk, come on! Or we miss the train. Where ls he actually? Tell us! You can not rely on the guy. Hey, wait! I help you! It is better with four, he'? Peter!

Good mght, Fraulem Slems. - Here, have another cigarette. Thank you. Good night, mister mayor. Good night. Herr Lukas, may I talk to Fraulem Edith for a second? Of course. Why not'? I leave you alone. Stefan, I an': asking you, not to come in the evenings any more. You tried again last night But it is no use! Edith! - No, really! I Wont be corning down, people would only talk. As you say. I dont blame you. A black sheep like me. And a distinguished gentleman . Well, you ought to know. No start, no ending. If that is not a perfect line for our new bridge, my name shall be Meier from today. Ladies and gentler-men, honorable attendents, Again another new bridge has been built in Germany, and I have the honour and the pleasure, to hand it over to traffic today. General, please. Well, well, well, alright, alright, alright! This bridge is really great. This bridge is really wonderful. Was it built here? Yes, Herr General. It was built by me and Stefan Kolb. So, so, so. Then everything is okay. Then I can give over the bridge to traffic. Kolb, could I talk to you for a moment'? Here you are. Hello Herr Lukas! What do you think about our bridge? Isn't it fantastic? Such a crap, just now! What I tell you now, has to be kept a secret between the two of us. This is not loyal, but I want to give you a hint. I can imagine. I need no hmt, lam going to leave by myself. The bridge is ready. - Yes, yes. It is a beautiful bridge, I like it. Yes, we share the same taste. Unfortunately. No, no, that is not what I mean. I mean something else. The meaning I guess, is that I should leave. I want to. You have the bndge, you have the girl. What else do you want'? That is right, I Want you to leave. But not because of Fréulein Sierhs, or because I an': afraid of you. - But? You should surrender to the Hannover police. Volontarily. Because of What happened at the railway station. - I should do what? You should surrender to the police. Otherwise I have to let you and your friends get arrested. What did you say'? Kolb, I am sorry... Please. See. I have no idea, how they found out that you are here. But, if you are innocent, you have nothing to worry a... It is a very convenient situation for you, right? You just have to get me arrested, and I am out of the way. And totally legal. - Kolb, dont you understand? I want to save you from being arrested! Does Edith know about this'? - No, just you and me. That goes for me, too... - Yes I know. Despite all nobleness the effect is: Stefan Kolb must leave. If I had wanted that to happen so desperately, I would have a rnuoh simpler solution to make you disappear. Whlch ls'? - You can go to Technical University in Essen from October 1st. Technical University? - Yes. Did you do that? - No. Dr. Vvarnschaffels friend is the new director of the Technical University in Essen. And for your work here you got a scholarship. That's a fine plan. Well, lost again. The girl choose you, right'? I do not think this is the right place. Let rne finish. The girl choose you, but not voluntarily. So'? Nothing and no one forces you. - But something forces you after all. Wlch would be'? - Pity, Herr Lukas. Yes, pity. Nothing but pity. She may be right. You deserve her, maybe much more than I do. Who am I anyway'? However: If I Wanted to, and if I Went to her right now and say: "Edith, don't lie to yourself." VVhat gives you the right to talk like that?
