I don't know where I should begin my story? My name is Liu Yazi, 25. Longing for a free and independent way of life, two years ago, I came to Hong Kong as a master's degree student. But I could never have guessed that I'd be lying here pregnant, with this strange man who claims to be my baby's father next to me. And several other people who are affecting my fate. Thank you. Take a seat, please, Miss Liu. Here, please. This is for my client. Don't worry. It's strictly confidential. Have a seat. Have some tea. Okay, shall we begin? Relax. Miss Liu, this is how it goes. Our client is looking for a young woman for artificial insemination with her ovum and the husband's sperm. During pregnancy, the surrogate mother will be provided with the best accommodation and treatment, plus a reward of 100,000 US dollars. But there are two conditions which you must observe. First, you have no right to access my client's background. You won't know who she is. Second, the child you're giving birth to doesn't belong to you. And you're not it's mother. The contract stipulates you'll forfeit any claim to the child. Understand? I have a question. Please go ahead. Is this legal? Let's put it this way. Hong Kong law doesn't permit surrogate motherhood. But it does allow reasonable compensation for harm caused by endowment. Let me explain the technical details to you, Miss Liu. All right. Before insemination, we'll give you a full body check-up and other lab tests. When the ova matures, we'll use an oval needle instead of physiological stimulations to induce ovulation. After 24 to 36 hours, we'll inject the cleansed sperm into the uterine cavity. That'll complete the entire process of artificial insemination. The contract also requires you to defer your studies. During pregnancy, you're not allowed to contact anybody. I have one condition. I want to be paid in one lump sum. Wait a sec. Dr. Wan, what do you think of this girl? She's a nice one. She fits all our requirements. She has an elder brother in Shaoxing? Affected with aorta degeneracy and chronic renal disease. She urgently needs money for his operation. Are you sure it's safe to pay her in one go? I'll arrange the operation myself to ensure everything's under control. I'll count on you, Kammy. You'll have to pay for it if anything goes wrong. Hello, sister-in-law? Sister-in-law. I've raised the money for brother's operation. I borrowed it from the law firm I'm working for. I'll work for them for the next few years to repay it. Don't worry, okay? LAW CHUN MING Sit down. What? I have two pieces of good news. Tell me. First, my application for exchange in Barcelona next semester has been approved. That's great. Second... Make a guess. How do I know? My sister has agreed to loan us $500,000. What does that have to do with me? That'll solve the problem of your brother's operation fee. It's not enough. We'll find another solution. Let me help you. I'm not turning you down. I just don't know how to pay you back. Don't be silly. You can do that by sleeping with me. What do you mean? What do you take me for? - Sorry, Yazi. I didn't mean it. - I don't want to talk about it. Go away. - I didn't really mean what I said. - Just go away! I apologize. Does that please you? LAW CHUN MING Hello, Tracy? I've just emailed you the report on Liu Yazi. Congratulations. She's made it. And so... I entered into a world completely alien to me, facing some decisions against which I don't know how to measure. I had promised myself at a very early age that I'd be true to myself and lead a life of my own. But now? This house is one of my client's estates. She seldom comes here. - Miss Au. - Hello, Anna. Miss Liu. Let me introduce you. This is Anna. Your personal assistant. She'll take care of your everyday life. Just let her know whatever you need. Hello, sister-in-law? Did you receive the money? That's nice. I've asked my lawyer friend here to arrange everything. She'll fly to Beijing to book the hospital. Okay, fine. Let's talk more later. The operation lasted six hours. The doctors were pleased. That said, great care still has to be taken to avoid infection and complications. How's my sister-in-law? Was she nice to you? She's okay. She cares about you a lot. I had a tense relationship with her. My parents died early and I was raised by my brother. Because of that, he postponed his marriage until after I graduated. Sister-in-law always thought I was in their way. What did your parents do? Dad was an editor in a publication house. Mom was a waitress. Dad died of acute pneumonia when I was five. Soon after, mom got cancer. I'm sorry. Do you have many cases like this? No. My boss just treats them like a business. How about you? Me? Like all Hong Kong people, I just try to survive. I brought a few CDs for you. They say music is good for the baby. I don't know. I learnt about classical music from a friend who played violin. I wanted to study music when I was small, but couldn't afford it. Yeah, it can be expensive. After my parents' death, brother and I were constantly moving. Here and there. Those were my drifting days. How about your boyfriend? I don't have one. Did Anna tell you something? Just asking. You're doing fine. I'm happy. Dr. Wan, can I have a look? There's no need. The baby is in perfect shape. Mario's coming. He was ordered to leave by the police. Is there anywhere you want to go, Miss Liu? Yazi? Excuse me, mister. I think you have the wrong person. Let's go and find Mario. Hey! - Are you home, Yazi? - Yes. Wait for me and Dr. Wan, we'll come right over. - Anything wrong? - We'll talk later. Wait for us. Wake up, Miss Liu. Miss Au, Dr. Wan. - Go back to your room, Anna. - May I make you some tea? - No, thanks. - Okay. Let's sit down. Sit down. We have some unexpected news for you, Yazi. My client wants to terminate your contract. Why? Forgive me for not being able to further explain. The contract reserves my client's right to do that. What does that mean? We'll perform an abortion for you. Don't worry. It's pretty safe for a pregnancy not exceeding 20 weeks. I won't do that. Stay calm, Yazi. This is a totally unforeseen situation. It's my client's final decision. We spent the whole afternoon trying to dissuade her. Dr. Wan? No one wants to see this happen. Fortunately, it's still early. You may still be able to bear your own child later. We did try to see things from your standpoint. We've convinced her to let you retain what you've been paid. Plus an additional 20,000 US Dollars. But she insists that this is a bonus, not compensation. You don't leave me any choice. Right. All of this is stated in the contract. Strictly speaking, your loss is minimal. You can go back to your own life. Is this how you lawyers see things? Dr. Wan, what about the baby? It's a human life! Medically speaking, it's still not human. You mustn't feel responsible for this. Take it easy, Miss Liu. I'll give you some pills. Just a tranquilizer. I want you to sleep well. I'll conduct a counselling session for you. Okay? Hello, Yazi? Speaking. Are you alright? Yes. Have you taken Dr. Wan's prescription? Yes. Forgive me. I never thought it'd come to this. I feel drowsy. It must be the prescription. Go to bed. We'll talk later. Okay. Bye-bye. Please wait. Hello, Miss Liu. Dr. Lok here. Hello, Dr. Lok. Is this your first time for a fetal scan? Yes. You'll find this gel a bit cold. Just relax. You may look at this screen, Miss Liu. - Wow! It's a pair of twins. - What? Should be a boy and a girl. These are their faces and their hearts. Listen to the sound of their heartbeats. They beat rhythmically? This is the first one. This is the second one. YAZI: YOU LIAR! I'M PREGNANT WITH TWO LIVES! This really isn't necessary, Tracy. No? What am I going to do? I'm asking you. What am I going to do? Give me and Kammy some time. We'll think of a solution. What solution? The girl's vanished! How do I explain the story if it gets leaked. What should I tell my husband? That I got ripped-off? She's not that kind of person. Remember what I said, Kammy? You must pay for what happened! Steven, you know very well I'll have my own way. I can check her out easily. - Have some milk first. - Thank you. My goodness! What? How did you come up with these names? - Any problem? - They're gross! Liu Yin? Liu Ying? Liuying? They sound like prostitutes. - Is that what you want your kids to be? - Liuying! Are you out of your mind? You call yourself a university student? Don't make fun of me. - You lied. - It's my first time being a mother! I see. Gipsy, help me name my kids. I didn't even finish junior high. I'm illiterate. - I'm serious. - I'll get you some food! She has cancer. She came here after she had learned about it. The doctor said she could only survive a year. Now three years have passed. Awesome woman! Have you ever feared being alone? Of course, especially when I was sick. It felt helpless. So, health is very important. Eat! Kids are the greatest gift on earth. It's easy to give birth to them, but hard to raise and educate them. We must protect them from all kinds of evils. I'll be their teacher. I'll teach them to swim. - Great. - We'll swim to the opposite mountain. - That's far away. - You can use a speedboat. Feel them! They're being naughty. Wow! They're doing backflips! Please, no! Not inside mummy's tummy. Be a good boy! No more backflips! Who is it? Are you Miss Liu? My name's Yuk Cheung. Yuk as in Yuk Dat-fu the poet. Cheung with three strokes. I don't know you. I'm the father of your babies. They don't have a father. I have good intentions, Miss Liu. Can we talk? Go away, or I'll call the police. Go away! YUK CHEUNG Let me. Thank you. Is someone following you? Sorry for being so early. It's nothing. I didn't expect your call. Where do you want to go? How about my place? The taxi's over there. Who is it? It's me. Sorry to wake you. I went to buy some food. Are you alright? I'll cook something for you. Is there anything you don't eat? - Still not done? - Almost. I googled that guy Yuk earlier. Ever heard of The Roman Empire Group? It's a finance corporation. Quite powerful. Yuk Cheung is the boss's youngest son. Is he famous? Wait a second. Of the three brothers, he has kept a low profile. He graduated from CalArts, and has published several style magazines. - Strange. Where's that webpage? - I don't want to know anything about him. No, he looks really cool at his age. His wife was Tracy T., the Green Lady in the film Killer's Angels. They've just divorced. Done. I'll be the father and take care of you. Don't be silly. You always think I'm kidding. Stop thinking about such things. I'd like to talk to Kammy. Sorry, I didn't see you. Sit down, please. How have you been? This man came to see me. Right. Mr. Yuk is the babies' father. I want to know the whole story. He wants the babies back. First they wanted an abortion, now they want them back. What do they want exactly? Please, let me explain. What do you know about Mr. Yuk? I know he's awfully rich. Among the rich, he's a civilized man. Have you ever heard of Tracy T? She's Mr. Yuk's wife and an actress. She's the one who contracted you. They've been married for five years, but remained childless. It's very important for Tracy to bear an heir for the family. Tracy didn't intend on Mr. Yuk knowing anything about the arrangement. She was pretending to be the mother. How would she manage that? Some women simply have their ways. Mr. Yuk spends most of his time in America. But in the middle of all this, he unexpectedly agreed to a divorce, plus a huge alimony for Tracy. That's why she wanted the contract terminated. She was afraid if Mr. Yuk found out about you, she wouldn't get a single cent. She knew they were twins? Yes. I had to report everything to her. But you lied to me! I told you. You mustn't think of yourself as the mother! They're two human lives! Tracy was afraid you'd blackmail her. She threatened to use force to find you by asking the triads. What? That's why I decided to break the truth to Mr. Yuk. I'd told you. Mr. Yuk is a civilized man. He didn't want to pursue it further. He proceeded with the divorce and alimony. But he insisted on getting the children back. Miss, can I get you anything? - Later. - Okay. He has no right to the babies. He wants to talk. He can pay. Just quote a price. So it's money again? Yes. Absolutely. You'll need money for the delivery. Where will they live? Hong Kong or China? How will they live? How about education? What if you get married one day? That's my business. I'm saying all this, not on Mr. Yuk's behalf, but because I consider you a dear friend. I wish we were. See you. Miss Liu? I'm Yuk Cheung. May I have a word with you? I don't mean you any harm. - Too windy? - I'm fine. I apologize on behalf of Tracy. I had no idea about the deal. I feel very bad about what happened to you. I want the two children back after they are born. No. No? Why? I'm their father. What about me? I'm their mother. What are your conditions? What do you mean? I'll take care of the rest of your life. I don't need that. If you want a title or something, I'll consider it. What is all this crap? Marriage is possible. But we must sign a contract first. A contract which you may terminate at any time? What am I talking about? This is absurd. There's nothing absurd about it. You're the kids' mother and I'm the father. This is crazy. Come on, quote a price. Money doesn't apply here. Money doesn't apply? Wasn't money the reason you signed the contract? You rat! Miss, are you alright? Come and sit over here for a while. Go... Young man, let's sit over there. Are you okay? Let them talk. Sit down. Did the baby kick you? Yes. Had a row with your hubby? See? Women need coaxing at times. You have to be patient with them. Marriage is a long and winding road. It was like that between me and my wife. We quarreled so often! Let me tell you, men are like that. They needed a lesson. You did just right. So right. Is this hotel alright? Okay. The price is reasonable. - Let's grab a bite. - Okay. This way. I'll only have class in the afternoon tomorrow. I'll help you move. Did you meet the lawyer today? I also met Yuk. Did he come, too? No. After Kammy. What do you think if I give them the babies? Why? Did they offer you money? They always do that, don't they? I only care abut the future of the children. You think this will be good for their future? I hope you know what you're doing. You don't have to ask me. I'm not the father. - Forget it! You won't understand. - Of course I don't. I don't understand why you didn't accept my money. Nor why you agreed to this kind of deal. I don't see why you approached them after what they did to you. Worse still, I don't know why I'm doing all this despite you not caring at all. There are things you simply can't understand. It's too complicated a story. You know something? You're very selfish! Sister-in-law? How's brother? Has he slept? Wait a sec. Your brother hasn't been well. Oh! How is he? Everything was fine at first. The operation was successful and he recovered well. But he's been infected with other complications. The doctors said his health has been bad anyway. The result of all these years of struggles. What's worse, he's rapidly losing his eyesight. Please take good care of him. Let him rest more. Do you need money? Mr. Yuk. Have a seat, Kammy. What's the matter? Please accept my apologies, Mr. Yuk, for this messy situation. The blame is mine. It's not your fault. This girl is quite a character. How was your meeting with her? She slapped me. What? I proposed marriage. With everything pre-agreed and signed, of course. She must have thought I was insulting her. Girls like her are difficult to come by these days. Well, you said you'd been thinking a lot. Me, too. You know what? My dad always told me, one must always think contrariwise, whether doing business or engaging in the arts. Meaning, a surprise attack. I've decided to court this girl. What? Are you serious? Do I sound like I'm kidding? I'm single. She's unmarried. Why not? You know her much better. Be my counsellor. Your counsellor? Now you're kidding. I'm dead serious. You really think she'd accept you? It's difficult to tell. My biggest disadvantage is... most probably my age. Right? Sorry. No comment. No problem. Miss Liu, something for you. These were delivered while you were out. Thank you. SORRY FOR MY RUDENESS PLEASE FORGIVE ME YAZI: THANKS FOR THE FLOWERS. LAW: WHAT FLOWERS? - Miss Liu? - Yes. Please sign here. THEY SAID YOUNG MOTHERS LOVE SWEETS. LET'S BE FRIENDS? YUK. Thank you. - Who sent this? - A chauffer. A PERFORMANCE BY A YOUNG DANCE TROUPE. BE MY GUEST? YUK. Spread across 70 countries, most of them lived in Asia. In addition to the vast cultural diversity, a recent study by the World Bank shows that indigenous people are key to protecting our forest. Like the Awara Tribes in Northeastern Brazil... Do you feel cold? I'm okay. They say air-conditioning is bad for pregnant women. Do you like my glasses? Some friends said I look younger without them. Mr. Yuk? Call me Lawrence. Mr. Yuk, thank you for your presents. They're nothing. I'm not sure what your intensions are, but I'd like to reiterate, I've decided to raise my own kids. I didn't sound very polite the other day. The presents were for my apologies. I genuinely want to be friends with you. We shouldn't be enemies. Even if you're going to raise the kids, or you aren't prepared to tell them the truth. There's no denying the fact that I'm their father. If we're friends, at least I can visit them from time to time. Right? Excuse me for being over-sensitive. It's perfectly understandable. People usually judge me by my family. Most of them think I'm just a filthy rich guy. You know? I've always wanted to find a true friend. Someone who will treat me, not as a rich guy, but just a common man. Know what I mean? She's very pregnant. If something has happened to her, will you be responsible? Mister, we're not allowed to let strangers access our guests' rooms. I'm not a stranger. I'm her boyfriend. Hey! There she is. Chun-ming, what's wrong? You were spending the evening with this guy? What happened to you? I thought something had happened to you. Do you realize you're pregnant? I've been calling you for hours. I rushed here and asked this woman to let me into your room and she was giving me crap. You made a deal with him? Don't talk to me in English. Go away! - I'll go up first. - I'll go with you. Stop! You and your filthy wealth. Why don't you shut up? Are you alright? - Gosh, she's bleeding! - Sit down. Call an ambulance! - How do you feel? - Will you call Dr. Lok? Which Dr. Lok? Does Kammy know the number? - Have you called? - Calling. This can't wait? I'll drive you to the hospital. Dr. Lok, are my babies alright? Don't worry. They're fine. Why was it like that? It's the improper position of your placenta. It's not unusual for twin carriage. There's nothing much we can do. - Are you sure? - Of course. Just relax. Just stay here for the night and have a good rest. If nothing happens, you can go home tomorrow. Be a good girl and rest. Mrs. Yuk? Mrs. Yuk? Mister is outside. Do you want to see him? He's not my husband. That was the second time I was looking at this girl up close. I admired her insistence and perseverance. Maybe it was my background? I mean, I'm always hesitant and over-cautious when it comes to an important decision. I wasn't kidding when I said I wanted to court her. But I know that, at the end of the day, it's impossible... to bridge the gap between us. There's a second reason, though. One that I'd find out only much later. I don't know how to start the story of Liu Yazi. She disappeared again after she was discharged from the hospital. There was no way to locate her until two weeks later. She called late one night. Hello, Yazi? Where are you? What? What happened to him? Don't worry. We'll find out at the police station. I agreed with Mr. Yuk. This girl has, indeed, a special quality. Unknowingly, I developed a strange feeling towards her. Kammy, what's the situation with Chun-ming? I've paid his bail. He'll be released very soon. Why was he arrested? He sprayed some red paint on Mr. Yuk's car. Painted what? Some four-letter word. It constitutes a criminal act. Is it serious? Don't worry. I'll defend him. Thank you. Where were you? I went home to see brother and sister-in-law. Mr. Yuk was very concerned. He's only concerned about the babies. That's not exactly true. He's very impressed by you. Everything's fine. Report in two weeks' time. - He may go now. - Thank you. - I'm driving. I'll give you two a ride. - Thank you. Hey! Did you ask her to come? You were arrested. Was it wrong for me to get a lawyer? Where have you been? - I went home. Can't I do that? - Yes, but with whom? You're bullshitting again. Bullshitting? Let me get this straight. Do you know how worried I was when I lost trace of you? I was afraid that Yuk guy had kidnapped you. That your kids would be taken away from you. But do you know what my biggest fear is? I fear you'll go away with him and never return. I'm sorry. What was that? Are you telling the truth? I'm sorry. Why did you lie to me? I didn't. I just don't want to hurt you. What am I doing here? I'll ask Mr. Yuk to drop the charges against Chun-ming. Will you? I think he'll agree. Thank you. I'd like to thank you, too. For what? Want to hear my story? Go ahead. I came to Hong Kong with my parents from China as refugees. They got married here and gave birth to me. Dad was a workman in a primary school. When I was five, he was stabbed to death by a thief he had tried to catch on the street. Mom raised me single-handedly. We were very poor. At New Year, mom always searched the stuff people had abandoned in their backyards. I realized the importance of money when I was very small. In the real world as I see it, everyone, everything has a price. Tracy hired you, then demanded you abort the babies. And after that, Mr. Yuk tried claim them back. All of that is a manifestation of the power of money. I thought I had done you a favor by making them pay you a sizeable amount of money. But I was wrong. I've learned that there are things money can't buy. And you've proved this to me. How's your mom? Is she okay? She died before I graduated. Liver cancer. Couldn't even wait until my graduation ceremony. My brother sent his regards. How is he? Not too well. He's going blind. The doctors said he has a very weak metabolism. It'll be fatal if he gets infected with other complications. I truly thank you. I'm relieved we've cleared up some of our misunderstandings. I can see now that you were trying to help me. I don't know how to put it. It's late. I'll go now. MILLIONAIRE DIVORCED STARLET WIFE FOR YOUNG SURROGATE! LESBO LAWYER FELL FOR SURROGATE MOTHER! Can you refrain from smoking here? Can you stop that from being published? No. Or is it that you won't intervene? You think I want to appear on covers like that? Believe it or not, I've never meant you any harm from the first day I met you. Mr. Yuk, Miss Au is here. Ask her to come up. Mr. Yuk. Have you seen that? I had no idea about that. You dare say that? I never thought that Mainland girl was your lover. - Did you partner with her to set me up? - I didn't. - Admit it. - Stop that. Let's settle this thing first. This magazine will be out on the street in three days' time. The cover was emailed to Tracy by a journalist friend. - I'll try my best to stop it. - At all costs. You think you can stop it with money? You may stop one, but others will follow. Once published, all the paparazzi will be at your door. - Make sure it never sees the light of day. - Okay. Stop. Give me back my money. Tracy, I never cheated you or Mr. Yuk. - How do you explain kissing the girl? - Enough! Are you still defending her? You've really fallen in love with that girl. Go away! Leave at once! We're divorced. You don't have anything to do with me. There's something you don't know. The babies the girl is pregnant with? They're not yours. What do you mean? That you're not even a man! Get lost. I never want to see you again! I presume you'll keep this between us. Noted. Any suggestions? Are you talking about the magazine or Tracy? The magazine first. To deal with this kind of scandal, the key thing is there's nothing to follow up on. Hong Kong is a city of many stories. But Hong Kong people are very forgetful. Once the paparazzi have no further clues, people will easily forget the story. I think we still have time. As for Tracy? I don't know what to say. Just speak up. To what degree, in your opinion, is she lying? You know her as well as I do. I have thought of doing a DNA test. I know... Yazi will never agree to that. Tell me, Kammy? Do you really love her? How about you, Mr. Yuk? Yazi, there's something you should know. I know. Mr. Yuk told me. I see. Don't worry. You better refrain from going out. Close all the curtains. Just a second. Done. I've talked to Mr. Yuk. He'll deal with that. Get out! Open the door! Get out of the car! Stop the car! Get out! - Get out! - Get out, bitch! Quick! - Don't move! - Help! TRACY T. MARRIES YOUNG GYM COACH! Are you alright? I thought you're coming in next week. I was bored at home. Sit down. The most important thing is you're well. It's all my fault. You mustn't blame yourself. By the way, Lawrence emailed me. He sends his regards. He's back in Austin? Here and there, looking for the girl, I was told. Yazi asked me to give you this. Talk later. Kammy, how are you? Apologies for getting back so late. And more apologies for your injuries for my sake. I hope you have recovered. After you were hospitalized, Mr. Yuk called me. He said, for the safety of the babies, I must leave Hong Kong at once. I was totally helpless. Just at that moment, the babies kicked me. It's very strange, but it was always like that. I mean, every time I had to make an important decision, the babies would toss up and down, as if to remind me, "Hey, Mom, we're here!" They are born now, two weeks earlier than expected. I named the elder brother Liu Yue. And the younger sister, Liu Yun. I named them that because when they were in their mom's tummy, she was listening to music most of the time. I'm fine. Mr. Yuk had arranged for me to go to Canada. But I escaped during transit and came here alone. The sky is so wide and big here. The surroundings are peaceful. It has given me lots of time for reflection. I thought of my hometown. The time when I was small. When I was at school. Around the time I was seven or eight... I realized I was different from other girls. In middle school, I met Xiaolei. We were very close. But on graduation day, she told me, she'd like to be a regular girl. So that she'd get married and have kids. So for a long time, I also tried to let boys enter my life. I imagined I'd get married and have kids one day, too. I was lucky enough to have met some fine men. Like Chun-ming. Mr. Yuk. But in the end... I always failed them. Because I just couldn't change myself. Chun-ming once said I was being selfish. He was right. Most of the time I was just thinking of myself. Like consenting to Tracy's offer. Other than my brother's operation fee, there was another agenda. That I could go through a mother's experience. I received news from sister-in-law a few days ago. Brother had passed away. She said it was very peaceful. I had promised myself to never let others take over my life. In spite of all difficulties, I'll make my own decisions. Nothing has changed that. The only difference is, I have found company for that. They are my two kids. I'm very aware that in the days to come, all my love, my desire, will be secondary compared to them. I'm deeply indebted for what you did for me. Yazi.
