Our surprise holiday party doesn't start until after the Jule bell rings. Sorry, the suspense is tearing me apart. Thank you! (CHUCKLES) I'm excited too, Olaf.

(CHEERING) Okay, now! (CHUCKLES) Surprise! (GASPS) OLAF: Uh-oh. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Going so soon? The Jule bell rang. I must get home for my family's holiday tradition... rolling the lefse. Um... Ours is putting out porridge for the Tomte. We're making traditional bordstabelbakkels! And I'm gonna filet the krumsakringlekakke! That's a thing, right? Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Olsen? You're welcome to join us in the castle if you'd like. Thank you, Your Majesty. But Olga and I should be getting home to knit socks for our grandchildren. It's our tradition. (LAUGHS) Yes. And we wouldn't want to intrude on your family traditions. (SIGHS) Oh, so the surprise is everyone left. Hey, I say it's their loss. Who needs a big party anyway? Kristoff? I've got just the thing to cheer you up: my favorite traditional troll tradition. Care to join in? Uh, yeah! Okay, it starts with a gathering song, "The Ballad of Flemmingrad." I love ballads! ♪ Every December we all gather round ♪ To pay our respects To a troll so renowned ♪ In remembrance of the friend we had ♪ A jolly old soul we called Flemmingrad Tempo! ♪ We all dig deep down And we uproot the past ♪ We shove up its nostrils A fistful of grass Nostrils? ♪ We shape his likeness Bless his soul (SHRIEKS) Whoa, gross. ♪ Oh Flemmy The fungus troll ♪ Now, you lick his forehead and make a wish. (LICKS) Who's next? Elsa, you're up. (GAGS) Come on. Tastes like lichen. You're a princess. You don't have to settle. Okay. Not so much a royal activity. I get it. But wait until you taste my traditional Flemmy stew. It may smell like wet fur, but it's a real crowd pleaser. Oh, thanks. We're good. Big breakfast. (CHUCKLES) (OLAF EXCLAIMS) (CHUCKLES) I can't wait! ELSA: For what, Olaf? For your family tradition. What is it? Tell me, tell me, tell me! Do we have any traditions, Elsa? Do you remember? Well, I remember... ♪ It was long ago ♪ They would ring the bell ♪ We could hear it chime through Arendelle ♪ I remember the way that I felt back then ♪ We would ring in the season ♪ We would ring in the season ♪ But the Jule bell was for the kingdom. What about us? After the gates were closed, we were never together. (SIGHS) Elsa? ELSA: I'm sorry, Anna. It's my fault we don't have a family tradition. Wait, Elsa... (SIGHS) (OLAF WHIMPER) (GASPS) Sven! Anna and Elsa don't have a family tradition. (WHIMPERS) I know it's sad... but I have a solution! We'll go and find the best tradition Anna and Elsa have ever seen... and bring it back to the castle! Are you with me? Ow! Let's go find their tradition! House number one. Wow, festive. WOMAN: Coming! Good afternoon. I am Olaf, and... Hey, Olaf! Please let me finish, and I like warm hugs. This is my associate, Sven. We're going door to door looking for family traditions. Tell us yours, and we'll decide if it's special enough. Oh! We make candy canes together. Ooh! (CHUCKLES) Sugar rush! You're supposed to eat it. Eat my new nose? Why would I do that?

And what does your family do at that time of year? (CHUCKLES) Oh! (MUSIC PLAYING) Enjoying the Christmas sweats, inquisitive magic snowman? Oh, yeah! Nothin' like taking your coals off once in a while. You know what I mean? My troubles are just melting away. In retrospect, the holiday sweats are for those not made of snow. (SPLUTTERS) Oh, I feel so refreshed! Am I glowing? (GRUNTS) Here's a sauna for your friends. Thank you, Mr. Wandering Oaken. Oh, one last thing. Would it be possible to get one of those awkwardly revealing... yet tastefully traditional towels your family is so fond of wearing? Take mine, yeah?

(SIGHS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Anna, I owe you an apology for earlier. Anna? (CLATTERS) (GASPS) Hi, Elsa! (SIGHS) Anna! What are you doing up here? Looking for traditions. Ooh! (CHUCKLES) And what are you wearing? My old Viking helmet... and this was my sorceress cloak. Dragon feet! (MIMICS GROWLING) (LAUGHS) I found them in my old trunk. What's in yours? Oh, mostly gloves. Right. Rows and rows of satin gloves. Oh. Yep. Welcome to my world. Wait. Who's this little guy? Oh! Sir Jorgenbjorgen! He was a really good listener. Anna, how are we going to find any traditions up here? (BELL JINGLES SOFTLY) Unless... What's that? Look inside. (GASPS) OLAF: Okay, Sven... I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. This is a bit of a setback. Ooh! Maybe this is salvageable. No, definitely not. Oh, parts of this are still good, I think. Oh, no, this is unsafe now. (GASPS) Hey, the fruitcake! These things are indestructible! I'll just take this seemingly harmless shortcut here... and meet you back at the castle, okay? (WOLVES HOWLING) OLAF: Oh, puppies! (WOLVES GROWLING) Down, boy. Ah! I'm just gonna go now! (OLAF SCREAMING) Hey! MAN: Whoa! WOMAN: No! Oh, Sven! The Flemmy stew is ready! Anna and Elsa are gonna love this. (GRUNTING) "Oh, Kristoff, you're so thoughtful. "Now where's my bowl?" Hey, simmer down, buddy. Here you go. Whoa, what are you... Oh! Of course! "Needs more carrots!" Can't get enough of 'em, can ya? (CHUCKLING) (MIMICS WOLF HOWLING) (GROWLING) Uh... Oh, no! Olaf's lost in the forest? And being chased by hungry wolves? Yeah. Obviously. Ring the bell. Gather everyone! Come on, Sven! Make yourself useful. Olaf needs our help. (BELL RINGING) (WOLVES HOWLING) (PANTING) Okay. Please, I know you're hungry... but I need at least one tradition for my best friends. The fate of the world depends on it! (SCREAMS) (SIGHS AND GASPS) Yes! Yes, I did it! A tradition is saved! (HAWK SHRIEKS) Well, I guess hawks need traditions too. (SIGHS) ♪ Happy, merry, holly, jolly ♪ Tidings of good cheer (SNIFFLES) ♪ I never meant to let them down ♪ At that time of year ♪ (SIGHS) Maybe I should just stay lost. (WHIMPERS) (WIND HOWLING) (INAUDIBLE) TEENAGER: Olaf! MAN: Olaf, where are you? KID: Come out, come out, wherever you are! Any sign of him? No. (SIGHS) Olaf? Olaf? Olaf? Where are you? OLAF: He's not here. (ANNA GASPS) Oh. Hmm. I wonder where he went. OLAF: Well, he probably went on a mission to find traditions for Anna and Elsa. Oh. And did he find any? OLAF: He did... but then they caught fire and fell off a cliff. And then they caught fire again. And then a hawk took them. (SIGHS) I'm sorry. You still don't have a tradition. But we do, Olaf. Look. (GASPS) Wait... is that... ELSA: Anna made these years ago. When we first made you. "Hi, I'm Olaf." You were the one who brought us together... and kept us connected when we were apart. ANNA: Every Christmas... (KNOCK ON DOOR) I made Elsa a gift. ELSA: All those long years alone... (KNOCK ON DOOR) we had you to remind us of our childhood. ANNA: Of how much we still loved each other.
