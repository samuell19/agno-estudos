It's so lonely here. Like the edge of the world. How long is it till the tide covers the causeway? Not long. - Is this all there is? - Depends where you're going. It all begins again out there. - Perhaps there's a road hidden under the water, lined with drowned souls. (BELL RINGS) There you are. It only rings once. We've been warned. Come on. - Do many people get cut off? - A few. Before they built the lighthouse, this place was a graveyard for ships. There are hundreds of wrecks round here. Why did you come to Jersey in the winter? I needed to work something out. It can't be very real in summer. Everything's real. Reality is total. - Do you see that? - Perhaps. All my family are buried here. We are the last of the Dabernons, my brother George and I. We are all that's left of the centuries of the Dabernon line. That's sad somehow. There are Robinsons everywhere. Dabernons are like Jersey cows, they don't transplant well. - What's your first name? - Annabelle. - Always? - No, usually Anna. Hugh. Invariably. Welcome to Jersey, Anna. I'm glad you asked me here. I'd never have come on my own. Itâ€™s one of the most famous burial mounds in Europe. Come on, let's go down. This must have been the grave of some very great chief. Some of these stones weigh thirty tons. Imagine all those hundreds of exhausted men labouring to get them up here on rollers. Life was pretty expendable in 2,000 B.C. A lot of them must have died on the way. I wonder if their ghosts are watching us. Maybe. The past is another country, someone once said. We have a past, Anna. Some part of us is always there. Look at these marks here on the stone. They're called cut marks. - You find them on monuments all over the world, - but no-one knows what they are. When we learn to read them we can go to that country. Oh, I don't know really. Umm, bluish-green, I think. I've always wanted to wake up in a room of that colour. But my husband liked white everywhere. So what colour is your bedroom? - White. - Ah. But my desk in the library where I work is bluish-green and my lamp. That's something. It sounds to me that you don't like being at home very much. Oh, it's not that exactly. It's not what we say, it's what we don't say. After the weekend it's a relief to go to work. I suppose that's part of the problem? Well, David would rather keep me at home. So the library has become a kind of refuge, somewhere where I can think. What do you think about? The state of your marriage? Debit and credit balance? Something like that. Your job's very responsible. Yes. That's one of the reasons why I'm doing it. Lives depend on my decisions. I enjoy the challenge. The way she looked at him when he went off in the morning. - Was David never like that? - No, never! But you can't change people. After four years I still don't think he really knows what I'm like. - How'd you like it? - I'm not sure. - You don't commit yourself easy, do you? - Not to friends. Well, give me the verdict tomorrow morning. Bye bye. - Who was that? - Colin. He works for me at the airport, on the ground staff. Not much in his head. Quite a nice kid though. - What were you saying? - Oh, about David. What he really wanted was a wife, not a person. Just someone to be there. He's so old-fashioned. - They're getting very burned. - Hold them farther away then. - Now what are you doing? - Not managing very well. I build you the perfect fire and now you spoil the dinner. - You're not much good, are you? - I told you I was a town girl. We're elemental people. Everything must be you. We cook on fuel from the beach. We gather fertilizer from the sea, which in turn regenerates the earth from whence the sausage you are about to eat was nourished. - It's ridiculous. - What is? - Well, sausages being nourished. - Pigs eat too, don't they? Everything's so deserted. I wonder what they all do at night? I do wish I didn't have to go back tomorrow. I do hate hurting people. Hugh? Do you want me to stay? That must be your decision. You needn't wait any longer. I hate farewells. Don't look at me like that. (FERRY HORN) I have to go now. Goodbye. Don't worry. It's as much my house as his. Come on in. George? Hello, I'm back. So I see. Anna. This is my brother George. Anna Robinson. She's going to stay the night. - Really? - I hope it's not inconvenient? Stay the night here? That's what I said. The spare room. - Clean sheets. Fresh flowers. An extra place for dinner. Well, you better take her upstairs. Didn't he tell you about his history with the island? Remarkable work. Three years of intensive study and he's still only half-way through. I've been learning Old French and do you know any Old French? - No. - No. Few people do. - Some more wine? - Just a little. - I try to help with the research. - Thank you. We've always worked very closely together. I deal in antiques, so I look for a stamp in silver. Perhaps you'll see my shop in St. Perrier? Yes, Dabernon. Had some very nice branch candlesticks in the window. They're not bad. Keep the tourists happy. They don't know a good piece when they see one. The best stuff is here of course. Been with us for generations. We are a very ancient family, you know. - He'll tell you about Sir John now. - Yes, well, why not? You see that brass shantung behind you... - That's Sir John's habergeon. Direct line back to the Thirteenth Century. It looks rather like Hugh. There is a strong family resemblance between all of us. I brought Hugh up after our parents died. Well, you can tell that, can't you? He's been a real mother to me. Yes...well... Why are you looking at me? I wish you wouldn't. It makes me feel strange. I want to remember everything about you. - Morning. - Oh! I'm sorry. Never seen a naked woman before in his life. Good morning Annabelle Robinson. - I didn't mean to laugh at him. - It was his own fault. Anybody else would have had more tact. Or at least brought us two cups of tea. You can see the lighthouse. - You can... - All I see is you. You'll catch a cold like that. No breakfast this morning? - You've never done that before. - What? - Brought them home. - Brought them home, here to this house. For heaven's sake, George. It's disgusting! In mother's room! - In her bed! - You were probably conceived in that bed. - that's different. Are you going to marry her? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Well, I'm the head of this household. There are certain standards. Don't give me that crap. - Standards! Blue films after bridge are okay, but making love to a - real, live woman... I don't want to find her here when I get back. (CAR STARTS) I was going to bring you breakfast in bed. It was lonely up there without you. We can have it down here now. - It was beautiful, wasn't it? - Yes. - What time do you finish work today? - Not till five. Will you miss me? Every minute. Every second. - Come to the airport for lunch. - yes. I want to be with you always. - Hello? - Oh. Do you remember? We met outside the cinema. - You're Colin. - That's right, and you're? - Anna Robinson. - How do yo do? - Can I get you a drink. - Thank you. Tomato juice. Tomato juice, please. Why don't we go and sit over there. - Are you going on the 13:35? - No, I'm going to have lunch with Hugh. Oh well, he saw you first. - Are you an islander? - Can't you tell? You mean I sound like an Englishman? Oh my Christ! Thank you. No, I've lived here all my life. My father is one of the "Centineres of Saint Brelade". - De La Mare. That's my name. - A Centinere? It's an honorary policeman. It's part time and they don't get paid for it, but they're allowed to arrest people. They deal with all the crime in their own parish. Must mean he's very busy. No, not really. Jersey isn't exactly a hotbed of violence. How much longer are you staying? - Hello. - Hello. - Been waiting long? - A lifetime. - Shall we go? - Bye bye. Hugh, what are we going to do? It's impossible here. George will get used to it. Well it isn't just that. Are you afraid you husband might turn up? He couldn't accept what I said yesterday. Oh, and it was an awful line and we ran about shouting to each other. Does he still think there's a chance? Maybe. I don't really know. He couldn't believe that in one week I could meet someone and everything would change. And has it? Absolutely. Completely! I've never felt like that with anyone before. With you...I just want to be with you all the time. Let's go to Scotland. I want to make love to you in Scotland. What a lovely idea! - This is it? - This is it. That's the cottage. It used to be the old bakery. We'll be completely on our own. It's not just an affair, is it? No. It's a love affair. Come on, let's tell the McKays we're here. (DOG BARKING) - I'm very happy. - Good. It can be so simple. Wants...good food... A great, big bed. Whenever I went away with David it was always to a recommended hotel with television in our room. Nothing like that here. And another thing... - What? - Let's agree not to talk about Davis anymore. The past is another country. Hugh don't. It's dangerous. Fantastic! Don't be an idiot! Come back. I don't like it here. Please, let's go. Where are you going beautiful Annabelle Robinson? Home. I don't like that place. You must have more faith in me. Don't ever leave me like that again. You don't seem to need me. I might not have been there. I need never need with you around. Don't ever forget that. Why can't we always be like this? Just us. Hugh? What is it? What is it, Hugh? What's the matter? What is it? No. What is it? Tell me! Speak to me. Please, Hugh. Speak to me. I've got you. I'm holding you. I'll get someone. (DOG BARKS) Quickly! Quickly, you must come! - Calm yourself girl. What's the matter? - Quickly! He's ill. He's terribly ill. You must help me. Who's ill? My chest. Just get a doctor. Quickly, a doctor. I can't leave him. I've got to go back. Dafydd, get on the telephone at once for Doctor Irving. - Where is he? - He's on the beach... Look, just get a doctor, please! - What was all that about? - Heaven knows, but hurry man, get on the telephone to the doctor. - Aye. - tell him it sounds bad. It can't happen. It can't happen! He can't die. He can't die! You can't die. You can't die! You can't die. You can't leave me! You said you'd never leave me. He said he'd never leave me! Hugh, you said you'd never leave me! Come back to me! Come back to me! - Please come back! - Stop it! Stop it, you hear! Stop it. That's enough. Stand up. Will you kindly give me some assistance? Well now, with the sedatives I have given her... Oh, thank you. She should sleep through the night. I'll return for the necessary formalities tomorrow morning. What about him in the cottage, doctor? Is it decent with just a sheet on him and him fully dressed? Ah, Mrs. McKay, the dead are not able to appreciate consideration about such matters. Sufficient to do your best for her upstairs. And you, like it or not, are responsible for the time being for the both of them. I think you should keep this by till the morning. - What's that? - A certificate of death. - Subor... - Subarachnoid haemorrhage leading to heart failure. He was a fine, big fellow. - Strange him dying like that. - It can happen. No warning. No previous heart malfunction. No, no. It's my belief that when you're called there's no power on earth to interfere. Mmm, yes. Well, doctor, what's to be done with the widow? Mrs. Robinson will no doubt have to see about the funeral. - Mrs. Robinson? - She's from Weymouth I understand. Left her husband and ran off with this man. Well. It's the lord's judgement, that's what it is. Now, Betty! Married or not she evidently loved the man. I'll say goodnight to you. - It was good of you to come so quickly. Oh, not a word. I'll look back again in the morning. - Good night. What a thing to happen. Aye. What is it? What's the matter? What is it? Don't die. Don't leave me! He said he's never leave me! Come inside. Oh, good morning to you. Will you be needing Mrs. McKay to assist you with the laying out? Thank you. That won't be necessary. You can see. There's been a mistake. maybe he was just too strong to die. The doctor should have known what he was about. Him and his philosophising about the right time to go. They'll have a thing or two to tell him when he arrives. Aye. Come in. Well, good morning. good morning. I just came to say that we're leaving. Leaving?! yes. We were due to go anyway. I put the money in there with the keys. But what about your man? He must be very ill. - No. He's perfectly all right. - Should you not wait for the doctor, Missy? No. I don't want to see him again. He made a mistake. you can tell him that. Where will you be going? Home to Jersey. Just a minute. You may as well have this. No use to us. Thank you. Goodbye. Had to get away from that place. They don't understand. You'll be all right when we get home. I wish you wouldn't look at me. Please, Hugh. Hugh, stop it! I'm sorry. Don't worry, I'll get you home. I just want to check the route. Now then...take the A838 to Lairg... The 836 to Bennetbridge and A9. We've got to get to the airport by 5:30. I think we can do it. Please don't look at me. Everything's going to be all right. We're here. The house is freezing. George must be away. Come along. I'll light the fire. I feel better now, don't you? It's good that we slept on the plane. We're home Hugh. We've won. We've won! Now let's take your jacket off. Come on. There we are. Now, come and sit down and we'll have a drink to celebrate. Here we are. There. It's lovely. Don't you want any? What are we going to tell George? Well... He didn't like it when I was here before... Maybe now it'll be different. What do you think? Hugh... Hugh, listen to me. You have help me. I can't do it alone. Look Hugh, I'm going to say words to you, and you must try and repeat them. Will you try? Now... I want you to try really hard. Say...say after me... Say after me, I... I...love...you... I...love...you... I...love you. I love you. Hugh, say you love me. Say you love me, Hugh. Please Hugh! Say you love me Hugh, please. For God's sake Hugh, speak. Just speak to me. Please just speak to me! Hugh? I can't help him. What are we going to do? I love... I love you. - When does a man die? Who knows what happens at the moment of death? The soul doesn't die. It simply leaves the body. But what if it didn't? - If it went on living in a dead body? - A prisoner and a body decaying around it? Is it possible? What is possible? Hugh is not dead. If it weren't for you this would never have happened. He's possessed, isn't he? Possessed by you. You're a witch... - trafficking with the Devil! You have conjured an evil spirit into his dead body. My love for him has given him life. - It's revolting! His flesh is cold. - Dead! There is no pulse. - No heat beat. Hugh's body is rotting. It is disintegrating hour by hour. - And something must be done, now! Please, why don't you just go away and leave us alone? I'll prove it to you. He hears nothing. He feels nothing. I tell you he's dead. - Madam! - Hugh, sit down. Please, just sit down. - Unbelievable...unbelievable! At the trumpet's sound the graves shall be opened and the dead - shall rise again. - I know what we must do. We must take him to a priest. - A priest? - Exorcism. Exorcism. - This spirit must be exorcised. - And then? - Then he can rest. He can be at peace. - He will die. - Yes. And then it would be over. Everything. - It will be all right. - Don't stop him. You see, he wants you to kill him! he wants to be free. We must go, Anna. I can't go with you. Believe me, it's the best thing for all concerned. He died out there, on that beach in Scotland. He died. For now is the axe put unto the root of the trees. So that every tree that beareth not forth - good fruit, is hewn down and carved into the bark. - And the Devil was cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone. And shall be tormented day and night forever and ever. For the Lord is come out of his place to visit the wickedness of such that dwell upon the earth. - He will purge his flour and gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. - The Day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night, - and when men shall say peace, and all things are saved, then shall sudden destruction come upon them and they shall not exist! - looks like a bad one, sir. - Yes. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I'm not going too fast for you, am I? Hmm? Good. How does it go? How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach. I love thee with a passion put to use in my old griefs. I love thee with the breath, smile, tears of all my life. I shall but love thee better. After death. I see something so beautiful. Come with me. - Will you be afraid? - Not with you. We must go there, together. Yes. Hugh, love me. What do you want? Oh, forgive me for the intrusion, but the door, it was not locked, so... I'm the Centineres from Brelade. Gordon De La Mare. - Yes? - Would you be Mrs. Dabernon? Why? I believe a Mr. Hugh Dabernon lives here. No. No, there's no-one here. I regret it is my duty to tell Mr. Dabernon there has been an accident involving his brother, George Dabernon. - Who? - George Dabernon. He was killed in a car crash. It is necessary for the next of kin to identify the body. Where is Mr. Dabernon? - he's in Scotland. - Whereabouts in Scotland? He died there two days ago. - In Scotland. - Hugh Dabernon? Yes. There. It says there that he's dead. Take it. I'm afraid I can't help you anymore. Now please go. You'll have to go. Please. He's gone. They've all gone. No-one will worry now. Let's have breakfast. Hmm? No we can't. It's lunch time! Well, let's have breakfast anyway. In the morning room... Let's go into the morning room... Come and sit down. And I'll wrap you up. There. You are such a darling. There. I'm going to make you the most beautiful breakfast you've ever had. Now that we're really alone. I won't be long. You weren't waiting too long. Come and sit down. Here. You must be so hungry. Now. It's so difficult when people don't understand. It's hard to think of the shop without an owner though. Maybe when you're ready we can take it over. We can run it together. You know I can't stay at home all day. After lunch I've got to go out and do some shopping. You won't mind being left alone for a little while, will you? You can sit in here and listen to some records. Hello Anna. can I give you a lift? Hello, I'm back. Did you miss me? Hugh? Anna. Not much time. Come with me. Before I... Kiss me. Kiss me. You are dead! You are dead! You are dead! What are you doing? I'm sorry. I thought... There's nobody here. Only me. - What do you want? - Nothing. Nothing. I...I heard about Hugh and his brother. I'm very sorry. - Sorry? - My father told me. Mr. De La mare. The Centinere. - You're Colin. - Yes. I though perhaps if you were alone I could help. But of course you're not. I am alone. But... There's n-one there. There's no-one inside. The house is empty. Everything's dead. Can I do anything for you? No. There's nothing that you can do. I have to go now, he's calling me. Excuse me. Will you be all right? Is there nothing I can do for you? - I mean... - No, there's nothing that you can do. Stop! Stop it! Hugh. Hugh. Please Hugh, stop it. Hugh, stop loving me. Please stop loving me. Please stop loving me. Just let me go. I don't want to die. Hugh? Hugh, I'm sorry. Do you forgive me? Please. Please. Forgive me. Stop it! You're dead! I thought I saw a man leaving. Are you all right now? I brought you some flowers. I know what I have to do. - Where are you going? - To him. - We're going together. - Who? Anna, I don't understand. Anna! Anna, I know something's terribly wrong. Please tell me. If you tell me I can help you. Nothing is wrong. Not anymore. Please let me go. You can't follow me there. (BELL CHIMES) Something very wrong there. She said she was alone but she wasn't. There was a man there. I saw him leave afterwards. What? No, at El Tico's. I think you should come. Yes. I don't know what to do. Well yes, I'll be here. Okay. How long is it till the tide covers the causeway? Not long. - Is this all there is? - No. It all begins again out there. Oh! Anna!
