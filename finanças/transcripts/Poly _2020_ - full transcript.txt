My name is Cécile Jacquot. And I don't understand why we left Paris. And especially why Mom left Dad. They said they'd still love me, that it wouldn't change anything. It's all lies. I'm sure that down in that village, I won't make any friends. You're a pain, Cécile. Stop sulking. I'll sulk if I want to. I decide if I want to talk. I don't want to, at all. Look how beautiful it is! See that village? Look. So beautiful. I just want to see Dad. Time for music. Hey, gorgeous! - Have we arrived? - Almost. Mrs. Jacquot! Good to see you. Not "Mrs. Jacquot", Lucien. Oh, yes, sorry. You must be tired. Let's go now and talk tomorrow. Come on, let's get going. For Les Peyrolles, take a right. I do know Beaucastel. Come on in. It needs a bit of sprucing up, but it's comfortable. Upstairs, there's the bathroom and even the toilet. Luxury! Luxury, yeah, right! It's small, ugly, and it stinks. I don't want to stay here. 'Night, honey. 'Night. Mom pretends she's happy to be here, so I'll be happy. She thinks I'm still a baby. Registered nurse A divorcee! Hey, guys, look. It's the Parisian's car. Hi. - Are you the Parisian? - Yes. I'm Vincent. My little sister, Nicole. Want to come to our cabin? Yes, please. Hey, Bruno. Can the Parisian come? You're nuts. She'll never be in my gang. Let's go. There you go. What did I say? You make friends at school. I can't, it's vacation time. A long vacation of being bored stiff. Dad in Italy, Mom working... All my friends in Paris... Bruno! I didn't hurt you? I didn't feel it! - There you are. - You're so gentle. The doctor could never find a vein. It was like playing darts! Press here. - Here? - That's it. Keep still. All done. What a relief. - What do I owe you? - Nothing this time. No, I can't accept. The first patient brings good luck. You'll have other patients. I'm not from here originally. It took me a while to get accepted. And I wasn't a Parisian or... a divorcee. They'll get used to it... I hope. Yes, of course they will. - I'll go. - OK. Your daughter doesn't miss Paris too much? Paris, no. Her father, yes. Does he see her? This book will take you to Alice's Wonderland. Love, Dad Hello. Look at her shoes. Who cares? Look at that. Let's go see. Look. C'mon, let's go. Gus, quiet! Quiet! Come here. That's all I need! Honestly! Dammit! Hell's bells! I don't believe it! What're you looking at? Damn thing! Yeah, run along! Come this afternoon at 5 o'clock. Our star, the famous, the exceptional... Poly! Come laugh at the clowns, admire the acrobats, and applaud the performing animals! The first exceptional show! The tickets are about to go on sale. Mrs. Gina awaits you! For an exceptional show, exceptional rates! Reduced rates! 3 tickets for the price of 2 for under 7s! Half price for orphans and veterans. Step right up! It'll sell out fast! Come see the fire-eater! Ladies and gentlemen, and you little chimps... Little imps! Welcome to Poly Circus! And now... the one you've been waiting for, the envy of the world, the legendary pony of the Scottish isles, the incredible, the unique, the sensational... Poly! So, Mr. Riton... Go on, ride Poly! Boost him up. Hurry it up. Come on, Mr. Riton. Well, really, Mr. Riton! You clowns, find me a solution! Are you going to ride Poly or not? Poly is getting away! Mr. Stringy, get after him! Now, who will free Mr. Riton? - Who? - Poly! I'll go get him. Help! Brancalou, help me! What the hell, Stringy? Everyone's waiting! Get on the ramp, you bastard! You better not ruin my act! Take that! Move, dammit! Call Poly! Call him! We've found Poly. But no tightrope walker in the world can do this feat of acrobatics other than Poly. He will do it. But I ask you for total silence. Extreme concentration. You must help Poly. It's very dangerous. Here we go... Silence! Help! Help me! Thank you. We won't get anywhere with him. We'll get a more obedient pony. The audience won't notice. - What'll we do with him? - Him? We'll sell him to the butcher to make sausages! Like Chestnut. You made this? It's to thank you. It's my specialty. It got a bit damaged on the way. Let's eat it! - I don't want to disturb you. - Stay for tea. Alright then. OK. - Is that little car yours? - Yes. I'd love to drive. My husband won't let me. Really? Why not? He says women shouldn't drive. I see. Women shouldn't drive, huh? Or vote, work or think. Just have kids! Talking of which, where's Cécile? This is all wrong. It's like that nail, it's too big. I know you don't want to go back, but you must help us. Help us out, huh? Don't be a fool. Don't be scared, Poly. I won't hurt you. I know everyone hurts you, but I won't. I understand you're scared. They scare me, too. They're mean. You need a friend. Hey, what're you up to? Nothing, I... I'm with Mom. - A little girl. - There's nothing but. Mom? There you are. Oh, you had me worried sick. Hey, cutie. She's as cute as her mom. Where's the dad? He's gone... far away. Really? He must be totally crazy to go away and leave such charm and beauty. We need to go home. Thank you. I don't like him. Why not? Hello. He seems nice. Yeah! You should have said you were going to the circus. How did you pay for it? I didn't go in. Cécile, really? I did, but I hid. You didn't pay? You should be ashamed! What will people say about us? I'm really angry now. You tell me off all the time. I'm sorry. Dear Daddy, I miss you so much. I hope you're well and I can come see you soon in Italy. We're in our new home. Well... not really new because it's very old. It's hard to make friends here. I wanted to go to the gang's cabin, but the leader won't let me. He calls me the Parisian. A circus is in the village. There's a little pony called Poly. He's very cute... but he's sad. It shows. Well, I can see he is. The circus folk are very mean to him. They want to turn him into sausage meat. I don't want the butcher to do that. Stop eyeing up the Parisian. Go help your mother. Cécile, come here. Pain in the ass! What is it? - Come on. - No! I forgot to post my letter. - Didn't you want a drink? - Not now. I'll see you back at home. Bye, Mom. Sorry. Excuse me. Over to you, Colette. My husband's waiting. So, let's go. I'll never do it. Sure you will. - And then? - I push the pedal. Which one? The left one, the clutch. That's it. Now, you go into first. I go first? There's nobody here. No, not you! First gear! This'll take some time! Now you let go of the clutch. Here goes... It'll be OK. Go on. Accelerate. Drat! That motorbike threw me. That Victor is a strange guy. Do you know him? A bit. - Know what happened to him? - What? The château belonged to an artist. A great pianist. She fell for Victor. And him for her. They got married. One night, there was a fire at the château. The poor woman died in the fire. He was accused of arson. Did he? So they say. Why would he do that? To get the château. So they say. It seems they say a lot. Yep. I'll start again. Go on. Look what I brought you. Hey, kid. Don't feed him. Come on, my little ones. Don't worry, Poly. I'll find a way to get you out of here. It shouldn't be too hard. Dad's an engineer. So, I'm ingenious, too! So, I'll do what Dad does: I'll think it over. Put the rope through there. And put the hook underneath. And pull... What're you doing? Your vacation assignments! How conscientious. I'm getting ahead. I'm proud of you. Is this horse meat? No, it's veal. Baby cow? Yes. Eat while it's hot. I'll be right with you. I promise to never eat animals again. Where are you? Les Aubrais. OK. - Is it Dad? - No. Yes, I'll be right there. Goodnight. Wait. An old lady isn't well. Can I leave you alone? I'll be home late. OK. You go to bed now. Kiss me. See you tomorrow. 'Night, honey. Sweet dreams. OK... We can go now. Come on. Don't worry, I won't hurt you. Careful. Don't tread on me. We're here. It's your new home. You'll be just great here. I'm sorry, Poly. You wait here. I'll go get a few things. It's OK, I'll be right back. Poly, calm down. It's just to make you better. Easy now. Gently... This is to make you better. Don't worry. I know it stings. But it won't hurt afterwards. I've nearly finished. That's very good. Well done. Look. Here's a blanket. See? It's for your bed. Move. I'll spread it out. Some cookies in case you get hungry. I'll put 2 here. Careful. They're my favorites. And then, a nice book. "The Story of a Donkey." Want to see? It's a donkey, but it's like a pony. It has long ears and fur. You can look at the picture. It's pretty. Alright? I'll remove the rope. Easy... Let me do it. There. See you tomorrow. No noise. Don't move. No noise, promise? Boss! Guys! Boss! 'Morning, Mom. Wow! You're up early. 'Morning, honey. Here's your breakfast. Your favorite strawberry jam. I have a busy day today. - Will you be OK on your own? - Sure. Bye. I'm just next door. Hey, Poly. Sleep well? Are you on form today? Time for breakfast. Want a drink? Some bread and jam. You don't want it? What do you usually have for breakfast? Let me see your wound. Looks better. It's crazy! Poly's gone. Disappeared! Vanished! No more! My star, my treasure! Pull yourself together. There must be a reason. Well, he hasn't just disappeared! He's been stolen. But how and by who? Who knows? Stolen! There are no pony thieves in Beaucastel. Oh, no? Are you eavesdropping, pal? Are you up to no good? I'm not surprised your pony escaped. You mistreat animals. A criminal is lecturing us! Now calm down. We'll act rigorously and methodically. Gus... Hi. Don't worry, I want to tell you something. If someone finds Poly, he'll need feeding. He can't do it himself. He's spent his whole life in a pen. Why tell me that? Well, no reason. But you know, what Poly likes is carrots and apples. Hey, Poly! I brought you a surprise! Close your eyes. 1, 2, 3... Surprise! Wait. Be patient. No, look. Gently. Hello. Gus! It's not healing. It's opened up again. It needs stitches, doesn't it? I can't do it. I'm not a doctor. You know how to do it. I doubt I have any anesthetic. What if I promise not to cry? OK. Wait. Come here. Here. It's for you. I wanted to leave it outside, but as you're here... Look inside. It doesn't bite. You can eat them. And you never know... if you came across a pony... he'd love them. Go on, look. Reward for lost pony Not my cake! Will you report me? I'd have done it already. I don't like animals being hurt, either. For once I made a friend... I've already lost him. You know, he was locked up and beaten his whole life. He wouldn't stay at your place. He's enjoying his freedom. I'd do the same if I dared. You're also... locked up and beaten? Wait. It's fresh. He can't be far. Vincent... Look over there. Look. Hey, this is our territory. No entry. - Right, guys? - Yeah. Bruno! Forget it. You shut it. Shut what? Your hole. Stop it. We're looking for the circus pony. - You must help us. - Why? Brancalou will take Poly to the butcher. - For pâté. - And sausage. Sausage is delicious. Well, I don't eat meat now. And I never will again. If everyone did the same, animals would stay alive. Sure! Yeah, sure! Guys, there's poop. Guys! Did you find him? No, I think he's really lost. Let's keep looking. Hey, kids! Have you seen the pony? No, sir. No. Let's go. Guys, Poly's there! He's there! Easy now... You're scaring him. Stop moving. Look, he's just fine. Poly, I'm very angry with you. Why did you take off? I brought you a surprise. I don't know if you deserve it. You listening? OK, here you are. Look, Poly. But don't ever do that again. I found him. Now we give him back. No, they'll kill him. We have to. The police said so. Who's for giving him back? Me, me! Everyone raise your hands. Who's against? You're not from here. You can't vote. But we're all for keeping Poly. We have to hide him. - Anyone have any ideas? - Me. My dad never uses his hut. It's good, but we can't leave him locked up again. We won't. He'll have room to gallop. Yes, we'll build him a pen. OK, but nobody must know he's here. It's our secret. OK. - Do you spit-swear? - Yes. We'll have to take shifts to feed him. Can we ride him? - No, we can't. - Why not? The circus used a saddle with a sharp nail. Riton got thrown off when the nail went into Poly. How horrible! He never wants to be ridden again. Well, I think we've finished. When I was little, I fell off a trapeze. Brancalou wouldn't give me a rope. He said the audience would see it. What did your parents say? My mother had already left. You mean... she was dead? No, she left with a young guy. That's not right. What about your father? He never really looked after me, either. How sad. My father's away on a trip. I hope he'll be back soon. Lots of men are hanging around my mom. Mom, want to know your horoscope? Go on, then. So... "Money: Don't worry. It goes, but it comes back." I see. "Love: You'll be reunited with someone who was very important to you." Well... Who do you think that is? Sorry, Mom. Come on, Mom. Come on! Mom! No... You go up and down. You're good at the twist. Turn. Again! I'll turn you, too! Animal killer Solange! Come see. Look. Watch out! Not hungry? Are you sick? I won't eat meat anymore. What? You're crazy! You're the butcher's son! And while I think of it... Did you scrawl all over my window? Not him. Why not? There wasn't a single spelling mistake. Poly, where are you? Ah, there you are. Why did you hide? Ah, you're jealous? Because I was with Pablo? I'm allowed to have a friend. Don't worry. I'll never leave you. We'll go everywhere together, even to Paris. Well, when Mom and Dad remarry. 'Cause parents are complicated. Don't you agree? We'll never divorce, I promise. We'll be best friends. Well, if you want to... It's healed well. OK? Thank you very much. Why live there alone? I'm not alone. We're a couple. My dog, Gus. You hurt yourself? I cut too much wood. It keeps coming back. Nothing helps. Don't say that. Let me have a look. - Is it there? - Yes. Just let go... Lean back against me. I'll make you crack. I can't do it! What's funny? Nothing. Here goes... - What're you up to with that girl? - Nothing. - "Nothing, boss." - Nothing, boss. And you don't know anything about Poly? - No. - Really? - I swear. - You swear, huh? Look at your monkey. Tell me or I'll keep squeezing. It hurts, huh? - Cécile? - Go away! I don't want to see you! Stop imagining things. I already explained. I hope you'll be in a better mood tomorrow. What? Come down and I'll tell you. Feeling better today? Honey... I'll invite you all to Italy. To Italy? Italy! Will it work? - Operation what? - Diversion! They'll be busy for a while. We'll raise hell at the market. Huh, guys? Yeah! Sure! When you see Pablo, will you explain? OK. - So long. - Bye, Cécile. Bye, Poly. OK, guys, let's do this. What the hell...? Where's that damn goatherd? Baptistin! Listen to me, alright? Dammit! There are eggs on my... Quiet! Hello. Put me through to the château. Yes, it's urgent. I'll call you back. Mom... "Mom, I'm leaving home. I know you'll be very sad, but don't worry. I'm not alone." - Have you seen my daughter? - No. NO ENTRY Admire the scenery. You won't come every day. You're tired. My, you're thirsty. Well, we are a bit lost. It's OK. My dad taught me what to do. We have to go... that way. Come on, Poly. Let's not get worked up, she just ran away. She's never run away. First time for everything! Has she stolen a pony before? - No. - There you are, then. It never lasts long. She'll be back by nightfall. Of course. Once she's had a fright, she'll scurry home and fall into your arms, in tears, don't worry. What if she comes across danger? What are you thinking of? I don't know. A wild boar? A wolf? A wolf?! There aren't any wolves here anymore. Lucien... We'll organize a search party. Wet our whistle again. Well? You have to tell us the direction to guide us. Unbelievable! It's not rocket science. She mentioned Italy. So, south. - Yes, Les Guillettes. - Right. Just what I thought. Because now you think? Let's go. I'll come with you. No way. You must stay home if she comes back. Next to the phone, just in case... In case what? In case. This is an opportunity to test our new equipment. Right. Our walkie-talkies. It's like a phone without a cable. Modern technology. Thanks to that, we'll bring her back. Come on, Baptistin. Get a move on! You're here! - Clowns! - You said it. Those cretins put me in jail after the fire. Let me handle this. I know the area. Let's start the test. Sergeant to Baptistin, do you hear me? I hear you, sir. In the box! I hear you, but not in the box. If you were doing it right, you'd hear me. The button on the left. It's not hard. 1: it's cut. OFF: it works. 1: it's cut. OFF: it works. I can't hear you, sir. You lied, brat! - Look, boss. - Show me. That's fresh dung. Forget it. I've a better idea. Get the dogs. Come on, doggies. Follow his trail, dogs. Find him. I turned left, then right, then... Whatever! I was looking for the pony. Somebody has to work. I'll use the walkie-talkie. When you use the walkie-talkie... who'll answer it? Well? It was my ex-husband. Cécile rang him a few days ago. She said she'd visit him in Italy. He didn't think she meant it. Louise, don't worry. A girl with a pony don't go unnoticed. We'll find her. You should eat or drink. I'm not hungry. I'm going crazy, stuck here, waiting for a call. Yes, I see them, Gus. There she is. We'll cross the river. The ford's this way. Come on, Gus. Poly, please... What is it, Poly? Oh, no! We have to go, Poly. We must go, OK? Brancalou is here. Careful. We need to go, Poly. Quiet, Poly. Don't you understand? Yeah, yeah... Hey, you're not so young, either. Just be quiet. Come on. Look, Poly. A raft! We're saved! I hope you can swim. I don't have time to teach you. Come on, Poly. Poly, come on! Don't worry, just follow me. They're coming! Good. Well done. How do I untie this? This knot is a pain. Bravo, Poly! Amazing. You're tilting the boat. Come to this end, Poly. Guess why we're taking the river. Well, when we take the river, we leave no trace, no scent. I saw that in a cowboy movie, with my Dad. Move it! What's that? The boat! Come on! Don't be scared, it's just a fish. Scaredy! Wow, what a great turn! Let's try not to hit those trees. Smart kid. Good grief! Come on, Gus. There! There they are! - Speed up. - I'm at full speed. - Speed it up. - I can't go any faster, boss. Useless! C'mon! Don't worry, Poly. I'll deal with them. I know what to do. I'll shove 'em! Just you wait! Get closer. Closer. She'll push me in! - You're going in! - No, you are! - Strong, huh? - You bet! He's my Poly! Liar! Butt out, you brat! - You little thief! - Moron! - He's sausage meat! - Never! Riton, Stringy, help me! Bastards! Move that! The oar! Turn around, guys! Turn! Crook! Liar! Torturer! Coward! Let's get out of here! Riton, muzzle it. Not a word. We weren't here, nothing happened. Sorry, miss. - Lucien! - I'll call you back. No news yet. - No news? - No news is good news. - I can't take it. - Stop it. You're not your usual self. We called you "Miss Doctor" when you were little. So much for putting a smile back on your face. Know what? I called the chief of police. He'll do whatever it takes. Maybe even use... a whirly bird. Is it you, Poly? We nearly lost everything. Except our lives. And you know who saved us? You did, Poly. Thank you very much. - Sir... - That's the girl's. Yes, it's not mine. She's probably nearby. "Probably"? Where you hid her! Hey, are you crazy? - Where is she? - Up there! Find her! Don't waste time with this crap! - Shut up, you mutt! - Not the dog. Sorry, sir. I couldn't help it. He's just fainted. Give me the handcuffs. The key... Don't say you've lost it. No, I just can't find it. What a jackass! Get that rope! It's not regulation, sir. Is your birdbrain regulation? I push down with my knee, I give a good pull, I secure it like so, and at the last moment, I pull like so. He won't get out of that. Come on, Poly! Hurry! We have to hide! Come on! Quick, Poly! What're you doing? Come here! Hello. Yes, we were cut off. Where? Why didn't you get her? What? Who? Victor? No way! I knew it! I knew you wouldn't abandon me. But... I can't follow you. I'm too tired. What are you doing? Are you tired, too? Really? You want me to? Go slowly, won't you? Gus... Come here. Yes. Yes, boy. Carry on. Yes! Captain Pantalla will question him. - What about the girl? - We don't know. But reinforcements have taken over. They even sent a chopper. Move your ass! Get the big top down. We're done in Beaucastel! Brancalou, stop everything! Please, don't go. We'll get your pony back. I doubt that. We will. Come see. The master sleuths! No complaint filed... Haven't we seen the pony? Yes, we got a call. The chopper flew back to base, but it's returning to the case. Baptistin, what's so funny? Base, case... Good grief. They went back for the girl, but they couldn't land... See, I told you. - And we have the culprit. - The culprit? He's in the back. You were right, it's Victor. In the back? He's scared stiff. There's nobody. - What have you done now? - I don't understand it. - Why didn't you tie him properly? - You did it. I have to do everything! What do I look like? - Who shut the door? - I did. So, why didn't you lock it? The girl's safe. Good news. - No, she'll accuse us. - What of? Of trying to drown her. We must find her and silence her. Poly's alive, too. Poly is sausage meat! Oh, wow! Bravo, Poly. Where are you going? Wait for me. Where are you going? Hey, where are you going? Where are you? Wait for me. What is this? Move. I'll help you. OK, I'll let you do it. Harder. We shouldn't be here. Stop it, Poly. They belong to someone. If they find us, we'll be in big trouble. So, be good and don't do anything naughty. I'll go take a look. You be good, OK? Wait! Charlie, this is Delta. Child and pony at Château Beaucastel. Do you copy, Charlie? Careful, that's worth a lot. What? It's the police walkie-talkie. Silence! Child and pony at the château. Do you copy, Charlie? Get the car! Let's go to the château. Get down, you! Why are you here? I heard you were arrested. Yes, once again. - So, I left. - Escaped? They say I took Cécile. You don't believe them?! Why didn't you bring her? They didn't give me time. She's fine. - She is? - She's at the château. Let's take my car. Gus, stay. NO ENTRY Go on. Let me do it. What're you scared of? He's on the run. Next left. Nearly there. - Already? - Yes. I turned. Now what? Nobody in sight? Nobody. The coast is clear. The chopper's up there. It's moving away. They're over there! Where? Catch 'em! Go on, you! Come here, Poly. Stop! Wait up! Let go! Well done. I'll get Sausage Meat. It's all your fault. You scared of Brancalou? Filthy creature! C'mon... Stop it. Give me that. Give me that! You nag! - Where is she? - I'll go this way. Stop it, you idiot! Easy does it. Easy... Don't fall. Come here. - Watch out! - You'll fall! Easy now... Get off! Cécile! Careful, Poly! Don't back up. Come here. Stop it. Mom! Come here. I'll go. It's not my fault. Yeah, right, you bastard! He's alive. Go around. I'll help him. Well, let's go. Calm down. I'm coming, Poly. I'm here. Yes, Poly... You'll be OK. Yes, Poly, yes. Yes, you'll be OK. Come on. I'm Victor. We'll get you out of here. Don't worry. We'll make it. We can do this. Let me see. You're fine. Easy! Easy, easy! Don't be scared. Come on. Easy... Calm down. I'll fall. Calm down. Easy now. Come on. Easy does it. Good. Very good. Good boy. Very good. Don't be scared. Good. Come on. Nearly there. Wait... You'll see your Cécile again. Please, Mom, please! My Poly! No broken bones. OK, Poly? You were very brave. Bravo. Alright? I am now! We'll never be apart again, I promise. Isn't that cute? I think I have something for you. He's in trouble now. Not helping someone in danger, abusing animals and children! I love children. Pablo... sweetie! Tell 'em Dad loves you. He's your dad? Don't let him get away this time. Right? - Give me the key. - Well, you have the... - You've lost it! - You can't... You haven't lost it again! - Not again! - My pockets... We don't have a spare. If we don't have the key, we're keyless! We're ready. This is my good friend Victor. You're looking good. The château owner generously lent it to the town. Ma'am. - My little Louise! - Lucien! - Hello, sir. - A photo of you all? Mr. Mayor, what about the circus? We don't want a circus with animals locked up here. The animals will roam free in the sun for their happiness and that of visitors. - Let's carry on. - Sure. Bravo! Hello! He doesn't mind you driving now? He complains and shouts all the time: "Speed up, brake, pull over!" He needs to feel useful. You said it! I had the best summer ever. I want to stay here forever.
