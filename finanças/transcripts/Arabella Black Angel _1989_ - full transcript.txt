No, what are you doing? - Like I said, honey, I'm arresting you. - Oh, no. Please, no! - Didn't anyone ever tell you it's illegal to be a whore in this country? - Oh, I'm not a whore! I'm not a whore, I told you! Let me go, please! - Yeah, a girl in that place dressed the way you are tries to tell me she's no hooker? Get off it, honey. - Oh, please! You've got to believe me! (rings jangling) (Deborah sobbing) - All right, I'll listen. What were you doing in there if you're no hooker, huh? - I was looking for someone. I had an appointment there with a friend, you've got to believe me, please! (Deborah sobbing) (suspenseful music) Oh, oh, no! - Honey, you're getting hysterical, and I've got some medicine here that will calm you down. - Oh, no! (sobbing) No, please! Oh, no!

Mmm. I made eggs and toast. Aren't you a little hungry? Frank, are you? (typewriters keys clacking) (Deborah sighs) - I'm okay, thanks. - Oh, your mother's coming by today. She says that your editor's having his lawyer write you a real eyeful. It's about your new book. She wants me to remind you it's overdue. It was supposed to be published in June. - They grabbed Chapter Two. It'll be a miracle, considering that people keep busting my balls every minute of the day! - I was just giving you your mother's own message. Anyway, she just felt that... - She just felt?! (hand slams) - That you might start... - Tell Mother I'll take her advice! Right? And flush it down the toilet! (Deborah gasping) Now, what other great little ideas have the two of you cooked up for me? Huh? Have you come up with some magic formula, darling? The one that will write my next bestseller and type it out? Go ahead! Cry, stomp! I don't give a shit! Nobody's paying you to put up with me! I'm an invalid! I'm a goddamn cripple! - Oh. - Your husband is a cripple! (Deborah cries) A loser and a stinking son of a bitch! Get your ass out of here! - What's happening to us? Oh, God. Oh, God. (lush synth music) (wedding bells ringing) (traffic whirring) (horn blaring) (tires screeching) (cars crashing) (Deborah sobbing) - Deborah, darling. Don't cry. Please, don't. You'll see. He's not going to be this way forever. You've got to stop all this. The accident wasn't your fault, Deborah. - I love him, Martha. As much as I did that very first day. I swear it. He means everything in the world to me. - Of course, darling. And he loves you, too. Just as much. I know what my son is like. I'm going to try to talk to him a little today, all right? - Oh please, mama. It could be with you, he'll open a little. - Well, not to be syrupy, but when the storm's over, the sun does come shining through. - Mmm. (doorbell buzzing) - I wonder who it is? - I'll get it, mama. (birds chirping) (doorbell buzzing) Okay, coming. Who is it? - Mrs. Veronese? - Yes. Would you turn toward the camera, please? - I'm a friend out of hell. You and I need a little talk together. - Oh. (birds chirping) (keys jangling) (lock clicks open) - You were right, weren't you? You're not a whore. You're a rich, respectable, married lady who likes fun and games at night. Here. There's nothing missing. Okay, Mrs. Veronese? - How much do you want? - Hmm. We can discuss money a bit later. What I need right now is a repeat of last night. Get it? (Deborah moaning) - Oh, God. Please leave. - Huh. First I'll have a little chat with your husband. - Oh. - Hi, I'm Alf La Rosa. Vice cop, nice to meet ya. How about it? (Deborah moaning) - Not here. My husband might see us. Come on. - I hope for your sake you're not trying anything clever, Mrs. Veronese. - I'm not, don't worry. (door opens) (birds chirping) (soft synth music) (both moaning) - I'm not after money. You shouldn't wear these goddamn jeans. A skirt works better. - Wait, let me do it. - Be my guest. (soft synth music cont.) Last night, I found you in hell. Today, you're coming along with me, and we're going to heaven together. (Deborah moaning) - Frank? Frank, darling? Where are you going? (both moaning) (soft synth music) (tense music) (Deborah moaning) (intense music) (hammer whacks) (Deborah gasping) (hammer clinks) - Come out of there. (Deborah gasping) - Deborah, you mustn't worry about it. I'll take care of him later. Move now. (Deborah gasping) - All the hatred emanating from you. There was absolutely nothing, nothing holding us together. When you stopped acting like a loving husband, I was confused. I was transformed into a kind of... a mute, a monster right out of a... Oh, something out of"Dracula or Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. (soft synth music) Like in your first bestseller, Angel of the Night. It was that girl. I would've wound up like her. And no, that's no exaggeration. An angel during the day and a filthy, degraded thing at night. It was bad news all the way. Just bad news. Anyway, what's going to happen? Do I get arrested by the police now? You'll want a divorce, I guess. - I'll never leave you. You're my Deborah. That won't keep us apart. I know you were thinking of me. That I'd be involved in this scandal. I love you. - What if someday, someone finds that body buried out in the back there? - No one will ever harm you. Not my little Deborah. As long as she has Frank around to watch over her, she'll be all right. - Yes, Frank, but the man was a police officer, you know. He'll be missing in action or whatever they call it. - He was more than that, he was a blackmailer. They won't be looking for him around here. Now come on, kiss me. (Deborah moaning) - (man grunts) Mmm. (man chuckles and sighs) (plane flying in distance) - [Woman on Voicemail] Please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. - Not again. This is the third time I've called and all I get is your answering machine, goddammit. (answering machine beeps) Anyway, my message is, the police officer who was screwing Mrs. Veronese is the one who's disappeared, according to the report. Curious, don't you think? I'm convinced it is. I'd be glad to talk to you.

She told him not to ask any questions. He laughed crassly. 'This room set me back 50 bucks. I want my dough's worth out of ya.'" But those are the same words he used. - Huh. - Here it is. (footsteps tapping) Butter cookies so hot you don't dare touch, and a cup of good jasmine tea. Just the thing for a couple of kids that are hard at work. - Snooping, huh? - It's a wonderful idea. Thank you, mama. - Can't I have a glance at a page or two of your latest book? (tea pouring) - The cookies are terrific, Ma, but you better not. It's not stuff you should be looking at. It might shock you. - Hey, come on. Do you know who you're talking to? I've had two husbands and a child with each. I doubt if there's anything left in the world that can shock me. And at my age, boy. (camera clicks and whirrs) - I gave up noticing faces. I'd take a guess that kid got in after hours. Earlier than lock up, though. - Too bad. Keep yourself available. - Will do. - Hot and waiting for ya. - You told them to go heavy on the ketchup? - What else? - Good man. Morning. - Hello, Barlow. - A pretty messy show, hmm? Would you like a bite? - Could you tell me exactly what happened in here? - Glad to. There's a lot of blood around, 'cause they cut off the guy's dong. I mean, his penis. His male organ. His member, you know? Including balls. Testicles, uh, testicles. - What's that? - Uh, inspector? - Hmm? - There's a powder room there. Hmm. (soft synth music) Even if they got balls, like Gina Fowler, the girls don't stop being girls. (water running) - Oh, no! (gasping) - Anything wrong in there? (knock on door) (soft synth music) Inspector? (knock on door) Inspector? - Stop it, now. (knocks on door) - Anything wrong? - Not at all. Just a touch of stomach flu. Got no ideas yet, Barlow, do you? - Let me tell you, it's got me down. - [Frank] "Castrated corpse found in motel." - My God. (ethereal synth music) - Well? - You know I didn't do it. You know that, Frank. - Of course I do. Come here. It must've been a thief who broke in. - If I just stayed on a little longer, who knows? He might've killed me, too. I don't want to go to those places anymore. - Sweetheart, you better carry a handgun. The coincidence of that murder is too damn important now for my book. (engine revving) - Are you sure this is where you wanted to get out? - Yes, I'm sure. Of course. - Mmm. - There you go. - Thanks. Have a nice night. (suspenseful music) - I know you're there! I'm not afraid, but you are! You can't go on killing anymore! (intense music) (scissors stab) (Gina groaning) (Gina gasping) No. No. Please. Why did you... pick me? Oh God, why me? No. No. (gasping) No. (gasping) No, please. (gasping) No! (Gina screaming) - Gina! Darling, it's all right. - Oh! - It was a nightmare. - Oh, it was frightening! - I'll make you a chamomile tea. Okay? - Don't go, stay here. - If you just can't get back to sleep, no way I'm going to sleep either. I'm on duty tomorrow at seven. - I don't wanna go back to sleep. I know I'll have another nightmare. - Then I'll get you a sleeping pill, Inspector. - I don't want one! Come here. I want to... I want to tell you a little secret. - What kind of secret? I'm just mad for people's secrets. (soft synth music) - It's... it's something that I've been keeping inside me for years, but... but now with these scissors crimes, it's all coming out again. - Let's hear it. - Promise me that you won't tell anyone. - Mmm, I promise. - It... it happened a very long time ago. When I was a child. (Deborah sobbing) - Deborah! (Deborah continues sobbing) Darling! (soft synth music) Deborah. - What made you write all those things? You must know that they're totally untrue. So why did you do it? I didn't kill him. - Deborah, you're dumb, but I love you. It's a twist that's important to the plot. I couldn't just start writing about a second killer out of nowhere. - It's the only possible thing. I want you to understand that the murder, the killing, could have been done only by another person, but you think I'm the killer, don't you? I can read it in your eyes. It's more than... it's more than I can take. Why would somebody wanna do this to me? - I don't know, but I do know that Black Angel is going to sell millions. - You wanna get me to believe that I'm a murderer. (both grunting) - Oh! - Oh, oh, Frank! Frank, darling! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you all right? (Frank laughing) - I love you. And I'm as excited as all hell. - You bastard. (giggles) (soft music) (Deborah moaning) - Hey, what's with the shoving? - Come on. - What's with the pushing? What's with you two guys? You two nuts. - Watch out! - What, are you guys trying to make a sandwich out of me? - Shut up. - Look, I don't need you to break it. - Yeah, move it. - And I don't want... - Hurry up, come on! - I told her! Will you lay off? For Christsake. - Come on. - I promise ya, next year you can both be starting tackles on the junior varsity team. - Shut up, hurry up. - Oh, yeah? - Satisfied? Look, I got a nervous stomach. I might barf all over ya. (phone ringing) - Good morning, Inspector. (sirens wailing) - Good morning, Inspector. (phone ringing) - Inspector. - No, no. - Just for a minute, please? - I'm sorry. - It's terribly important. Inspector! - Honest to God, officer. I didn't steal that bike. - (clears throat) Good morning, Inspector. - Good morning, Inspector. - Good morning, Inspector. - Hi, Maury and Joe. (footsteps tapping) (phone ringing) (keyboard keys clattering) - Good morning, Inspector. - Good morning. (phone ringing) (sirens wailing) - Good morning, handsome. - How could you possibly do what you've done? - It's not my fault if your mother finished off your father's sex life with a pair of scissors. Just jealousy. It might justify your repulsion from men, but it's not my fault. - It was a secret and you know it. - Oh, don't make such heavy weather about it. You're a someone, now. Hmm? Would you like me to read it to you? "Gina Fowler, 38, university graduate, by all odds, the most attractive of the city's police inspectors, has a skeleton in her closet. The crime in her family's past resembles the case she's currently working on, the murders at the motel." (soft synth music) (paper crinkling) - All right, why did you do it? - For two good reasons. First, because this little paper paid me really very nicely for the news. - It was a secret. - You already said that. And the second reason is that you're too emotionally involved to handle this case. I hope they take it away from you and give it to me. Twenty days ago, you did appoint me as your assistant, after all. - I always thought that girls had better souls than men. - These are typical lesbian thoughts, my dear. (door opens) (phone ringing) (knocks) - The boss wants to see ya. Uh... Inspector? Inspector? The boss wants ya. - Me? - Yeah, you. The boss is waiting for you in his office. (phone ringing) - Good luck, Inspector. (Gina sighs) (sirens wailing) - Mmm. (suspenseful music) (receiver clacks) (dial pad clattering) - Yeah, precinct? - I'd like to speak with Inspector Fowler, please. - Inspector Fowler? Hold on minute, could you? (phone buzzing) - Yes? A call for Inspector Fowler. Patch it on through. (door closes) Hello? Inspector Fowler talking here. Who is this? - Is this Inspector Fowler in person? - Of course it is. Who is this? - [Man] I want us to meet. I have lots to tell you. - Has it something to do with the scissors crimes? - Those and others. Do you understand me, Gina? - Okay. Let's meet each other. Where and when? (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) - Just sign here. - Mmm-hmm. - All done? - Hold on. Here you go. - Thank you, sir. (knife chopping) - What's the matter? (Martha cries) You've been crying. - It's the big onion on the board. Say, what... what's that package? - It just came. For Miss Deborah. How much time is there left before dinner? - How much do you need, dear? - I imagine it'll probably be a half an hour while I fulfill my husbandly duties. Would that be convenient for you? - All I have to do is turn the fire down low. (papers rustling) - The case has been taken out of my hands. For the moment, it's all yours. You'll have as your assistant Second Grade Detective Borden. - I can hardly wait. Not a clue. Nothing. Well, do you have any advice you can give me? - I would guess the motive is just lust, Barlow, but the killer's a person who's suffering a lot and you have to know what suffering is like in the mind. - I'm not getting you. - When I enrolled in the police force, I did it because I wanted to wash away the stench of a sin that had been a weight on my family. (typewriter keys clacking) It's all yours. Now I'm not so sure I did the right thing. (door opens) Good luck. (soft music) (paper crinkling) - Put it on. - You... you haven't gone out of your mind, have you? - What's that supposed to mean? (both laughing) (romantic music) Oh my God, Deborah. You're so beautiful. Pose for me. Turn around. Show off your body. Be proud of it. Excite me. Oh, God. Now, sit down. Put on the slip. You're driving me crazy, Deborah. You're all the women I ever desired. All the women I ever dreamt about, wrote about. - Mmm, mmm. I'll try out something new. - Yes, anything. - Mmm. (Deborah giggles) - Show me. - Mmm. Do you like this view? - Yes. Now, pull the straps up over your shoulders. Now the other one. (Deborah moans) Walk over this way. Excite me. You're the Black Angel. You're like my new heroine. - I'm not your new heroine! I'm not the Black Angel! (cries) - Deborah! (Deborah sobbing) Deborah, darling. I know you're not. - Then why did you say it? Why do you always keep thinking of me that way? Oh, oh, why, Frank? (Deborah sobbing) - I don't, really. You are what you are. Hot. Tender. Sensual. (Deborah cries) And you live by your passions. Just like the girl in my book. Now you have to do it one more time, to show me who you really are. I've already written where and how it has to happen. You understand? - No, please. - Do it for me. (Deborah cries) Show me, show me that you're not the Black Angel. Do it for me, darling. I want to know who you are and what you are. (both laughing) - I'm just what you know. (laughs) I'm just me. And I love you. (both chuckling) (romantic music) (both moaning) - Supper's on. (both moaning) Supper is now going to be a bit late. (romantic music) (Deborah moaning) (phone ringing) Yes? - (gasps) I just... have to see you. (indistinct chattering) It's very important. Don't say no. - Listen, tomboy. I'm in a hurry. I've gotta rush. (traffic whirring) (Gina whimpering) (children playing) (traffic whirring) (children playing) (car door closes) (engine starting) (engine revving) (soft synth music) - Darling, come back to me. - In life, you can't help making mistakes all the time, but never again such a horrible mistake as you. - Not too bad as a put down. - Hmm. - Lacks class and wit, but what can you expect? My substitute is a fool. - He's about six feet and has all the little goodies you could expect. Everything you don't have. - Both inches of it, huh? How nice for you. You slut! (both grunting) (hand whacks) - And don't come back. - Come back, huh? You bitch! Not if you got down on your knees. - You filthy old bull dyke! - You filthy... I made you love. - Oh, go to hell! (crickets chirping) (birds cooing) - [Man] Liar. (suspenseful music) (Agnese sighing) Liar! - Where are you? Where are you? - [Man] I'm right here. (suspenseful music cont.)

Now for the local news. The so-called scissor murders are about to be solved, according to detectives. Inspector Gina Fowler is high on the list of suspects now. The dead body of the Agnese Borden, the girl the Inspector lived with, was found last night in the forest, horribly mutilated. The police have unearthed a macabre episode, one that goes all the way back to the inspector's childhood in a country town. (traffic whirring) (intense music) - Over there. - I'm going. - There's an APB out on you. - Sure, for the next two days only. If your mouth stays closed, you get credit for solving the scissors murders. It won't hurt your career. - Yeah, 24 hours, though. Go fast. - Thanks. (engine revving) (traffic whirring) (door opens) Oh, I forgot my key! Thanks a lot! - Hey, who's she? - You don't know her? - Never saw her before. - She looks like she could use a long vacation. - On the funny farm. (laughs) (intense music) (engine revving) - Yeah, follow me. Follow me. Tonight I take off your mask, you bastard. I'll get you. - Here comes the coffee. How did my baby ever find her old mother? That handsome boy is your little brother. Only now he's 30. He's a well-known writer. You might even know who he is. Frank J. Veronese. - I've heard about him. The minute I joined the police, I... I did everything I could to get a lead on you, but only when I actually managed to find you did I hear about Frank, too. - When I got out of that horrible place, I tried, darling, but then everyone told me that you should stay with your adoptive family. That's what was right. But I've seen you, darling. You're always on the TV shows. I simply must go now. We have to move. Come on. We're terribly late already. Come on, Gina. We have to leave. - Leave for what? - By chance, I looked at a little of your brother's new book earlier. He's sending Deborah, his wife, out into the night again. Tomorrow, she'll report on it. It can only lead to evil, to things that are bad, to filth and to murder. - Mama, what are you saying? - I must move, I must. It may be too late. We must protect Deborah. Defend her. I know the place that she goes to all the time alone. A terrible place. The Freak Boys Town. - Oh yes Yes, I know it. It's just outside the city. - Now, let's go there. Please, immediately. We mustn't waste any more time. Hurry, darling, hurry! - Yes, Mama. We'll go immediately. (suspenseful music) - Okay, who's it? (laughs) Whoo-hoo! - Hey, eat your heart out. (indistinct chattering) - I'm out of here! (fist whacks) - [Man] Come over here, honey! (indistinct chattering) Hey, what's the boxer doing? (eerie synth music) - It will cost you 40. And I only do it with my glove, okay? - Don't waste time. - You're pretty. - Thanks. Where are we going? - To a nice, quiet place. Turn right up ahead. (engine revving) - I have to... I absolutely have to make a phone call, mama. I need to talk to headquarters, that's all. Tell them I'll be getting in a little late tonight. That way, we can find Deborah and do something about it. - You're a very special girl. - Mmm. - Long as you're there, bring me a coffee. Would you please? Black, no sugar. - Sure, mama. (footsteps tapping) (traffic whirring) - Hello. - Hi, I need to use your phone, it's urgent. Then could you get me a coffee to go? - Right away. (customers chattering) (rotary clattering) (traffic whirring) - Yeah. It's more than bad. No, no, she was not cured. She's in terrible shape. Yes, I guess so. (traffic whirring) All right. We'll be there in half an hour, tops. (engine starting) (engine revving) (Gina gasps) (customers chattering) (rotary clattering) Police? I need to talk to Lieutenant Marlowe. Very urgent. Inspector Gina Fowler. Oh, please. Come on. Give me the number, will you? (engine revving) - Shame on them. Degradation. My son. He cares what happens to others besides him. So he needs protection. He needs to be protected from them. You mean the Freak Boys home? That back alley, whatever it's called? - Yes. I know just where it is, Lieutenant. And I know who the killer is, too. - How about I come get ya? - Fine, I'm in the little bar at Craig and Second. - Be there in two minutes. (Deborah moaning) (suspenseful music) (intense music) (Deborah moaning) (lightning striking) - Hey, who's that? Hey lady, eat your heart out. (thunder rumbling) - Hey, baby, let's go. - Hi, granny. I got 12 inches of heaven here for ya. - Take care, little child. You know what could happen to those 12 or so inches you're so happy about? Do you know what heaven is? Hell is heaven. Hell is heaven! (engine revving) (thunder rumbling) (lightning striking) (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) (door opens) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) (branch snaps) - Who's there? I'm not afraid of you. Come on out of hiding. What do you want from me? (suspenseful music) Frank, oh no. - Don't look at me like that. I'm not exactly the killer, you know. I followed you because I thought you might be in danger. I was worried about you. - And what about your legs? - Huh, they're whole. (lightning striking) A bad joke, if you like, but I had writer's block and I couldn't put two words together down on paper. So I thought it over and came to the conclusion that it might be interesting if I, uh... I pretended to be paralyzed, you know? A man psychologically blocked and physically paralyzed, but planning eight new stories, and the use of my legs would get better and better with each successful book. A miracle. - Oh. - A miracle and a bestseller. (hand whacks) (Frank chuckles) - Your next bestseller! That's all you can think of, isn't it? Oh! - I want you! - No! - I want you here and now! - No! Stop! Oh, let me go! I'm sick to death of your goddamn love. I've catered for you and provided you the psychological stimulus. - You're a sick one. You're a nymphomaniac. Yeah, and that's what I'm loving you for. (Deborah groaning) Yeah, it's the reason I married you. That's why! (grunts) You're the one who needs me! (Deborah groaning) Yeah, we're gonna do it here and now. (Deborah groaning) Right where you did it with that kid. (both groaning) And then I'm gonna round up a bunch of guys, and you're gonna do it with all of them while I watch! You're gonna do it and love it! (both groaning) (thunder rumbling) (Deborah moaning) (both moaning) (intense music) (knife stabs) (Frank groaning) (lightning striking) (Deborah gasping) (Deborah screaming) - Frank, no. (lightning striking) Frank. (soft synth music) (fingers tapping) (tape machine clacks) - [Private Eye] Anyway, my message is the police officer who was screwing Mrs. Veronese is the one who's disappeared, according to your report. Curious, don't you think? I'm convinced it is. I'd be glad to talk to you. (Gina sobbing) (traffic whirring) (bell tolling) - Mmm, hi. - Hi. - Thank you. - Pleasure. (soft synth music) (indistinct chattering) After all the terrible things that have happened, I don't understand why you wanna go on living here. - I was just happy with Frank here. It's home. - It's just that there are memories all around, but they might be useful in their way. They may help to heal you quicker. - There's nothing I have to get healed from. (Gina chuckles) - Now, look. Darling, you had six months away in that sanatorium. Six months when you were anything but lively. You loved Frank very much, didn't you? You were happy, too. - I loved him more than you know. - I must tell you, Frank was my brother. My half-brother. Martha had him with her second husband, Joe. - Your brother? (drawer scrapes) - Oh, that book of his that just hit the stands posthumously, The Black Angel, I read it. I guess it'll hit the top of the public sales charts, but I have to tell you, it was absolutely horrendous. Does it bother you that I say that? - That girl is only a fictional character. - (laughing) And a damn good tooth, that thing, because she's a big schizophrenic. Nobody is that bad, except maybe my mother. That's what happens when someone can concentrate only on sex, you know? - What do you mean? Why? - Because she never understood about it. - Mmm. - Well, now you're the only relative I've got. Just be sure you look after yourself. Hey, I'll come by tomorrow. - Mmm. (birds chirping) Oh. Mmm. (Deborah sighs) (eerie synth music) (woman moaning) (mask unzips) (whip cracking) (dramatic choral music) (upbeat rock music)
