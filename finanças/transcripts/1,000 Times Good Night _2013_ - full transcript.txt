Nothing to infrastructure, hospitals burned down, medical equipment - - Stolen by the military and the lack of access to medical treatment... Five million people have died. It is... Since when? 1998. It is the highest number of deaths in any war since World War II. Can I use these images in the project? In the project? Yes, of course.

In Kenya there are some problems, but Kakuma is perfectly OK. Thanks for the offer. And we'll see when we meet. Consider the offer. - Call me when you decide. - Sure. So great. Did you have fun? One guy wanted Mom would go to Kenya. - And photographing refugee camps. - He asked me and I said no. Imagine going to Keena! It's called Kenya. - That's what I said! - No one should go to Keena. The guy said that it is safe there. We could go together. - As a mother - daughter thing. - It is not necessary. It is perfect for project that's what I'm working on. And it is safe. There is a lot tougher than you think. There is no vacation! Sure, I know it. But - - Think so much attention it will grab - - In school, in class... We need family time now, the four together. Why should you decide everything? - I do not decide anything. - Yes, you do! - You do not want us to go. - Your mother has just been bombed. - But I told you it is safe. - Safe? Yes, it is safe!

And something I study here in the Irish Sea along with my colleagues - - Is that we 're looking for something called technetium 99, and which is radioactively. It is waste that comes from a plant called - - Sellafield and is across the sea in England. We are looking for traces of plutonium. - Have any of you heard of plutonium? - Yes, I am! - I do not know. - Do not you know? It goes well. Plutonium - - Is a man-made radioactive metal that remains infinitely long. You can not get rid of it, and it is a problem. And we do not know - - What creates mutations. Can I eat it? If you can eat it? No, it's not good to eat it. - Is this boring? - Yes! - OK, guys, ready for the crab race? - Yes! Well, come along here. Now all pat. Thank you so, so nice. He's always yelling at Paul because he come late. Discipline is OK, but... Teachers should not harass students. Sixth grade she kicked the lady, she was completely hopeless. Do you remember? Ridiculous! Teachers do not talk about other than responsibility, But can one eight year old be so responsible? But is not that what teachers should be, then? Train your kids? It depends on. Yes, it depends on what level you are talking on. What's the matter? I should shut up - I can not handle it. - What? Life. Being normal. What is it? Morning coffee with girlfriends? All the chatter? I do not know how you manage it. Maybe I'm crazy. It's an established fact. You know it just does not. What? What? Becca, it's not so easy to say this. We do not publish your photos. What? You 're kidding. What do you think? Pentagon is furious over the image recently - - the soldier who died in an IED attack, taken by an enlisted photographer I do not know what it is to do with this, sorry... Not directly, but indirectly it. Very much. Editor told, private - - that even though we are not bound of any enrollment ratio, - - Pentagon considers your photos as a glorification - - Suicide bombers. If we publish, - - they will block all future agreements about enrollment and doors in Washington. Wow, this is - - The pure hypocrisy! Or even worse, that's extortion! This is not my decision, but they have said that this is a final decision - - which is not open to negotiation. You mean to tell me these images not to be seen? Sorry... Jess, you must persuade them. Go to the editor, you have done before. I take pictures of what I see. Do not you get it? Publish your photos! Tell him to it! I'll call you back. Sorry. Anyway, I have stopped. That said, I have stopped. What was it that really occurred in Kabul? I do not understand it, Rebecca. Why did you put yourself in mortal danger? I thought no, it is not how it takes place. It's just... instinct. One just presses on. I was not scared even. The worst thing is that... I took two images, from outside the car. I have no idea why. The police saw me. And while - - Discussed with the driver... I honestly do not remember, I only saw a few people, and the narrow. She set off the bomb, it is what I remember. It was all - - My fault. You think that because of you - - She triggered the bomb? Yes, it happened right there and just then. At the very people died, yes. - I would like to say a few words. - Oh no, not this year, Marcus I will not make a speech. Listen here. It has been quite a year. The advances in terms of plutonium - management is a breakthrough. And I'm really proud of you. - Even you, John. - Thank you, boss. These last few weeks - - Has been - - Challenging, to say the least. You guys have been brilliant. Thank you. I just Googling you. I had no idea... You have quite a glance. When you see such terrible things, you... Look, every time I need to say something about my job, I destroy only the company. And I've stopped. What? You 're not going to quit? - You are a brilliant photographer. - Does Marcus pushed you? Sometimes it's bad to be home. Thus, it is home has the hardest job. That's what I meant. I think you should continue. They are better than your fish photos. You can not use a tripod underwater. It just floats to the surface. What are you going to? Come on! Go ahead. I think you and Steph will be traveling to Kenya I'm not kidding. It is a good opportunity. She seemed so want to go, and you want it, and - - She needs... She needs her mother. I think it Marcus... It is quite true. We take a bath! I did not mean it! Are you crazy? Come on! And you must make sure Lucky - I have nothing else to do. - And Dad - I thought you were going to go again. - I know. There are only a few days. When I come back, we two go on tour. Yes, I want to Australia. There the platypus. Or the zoo. You get care - I'll. You can use this if you want. Oh yeah? Thank you!

Why did you start taking pictures of war? Rage. I was really angry when I was younger. Taking pictures was - - My life. I could express emotions. It calmed me down. Are you still angry? Oh yes. But I've learned to live with it. Working with the. What do you mean? When faced with all this - - Dreadful. The disorder. I want people putting coffee in the neck when they open the newspaper and see - - And feel and - - reacting. That's what I want. You know, Steph? You give me hope. Good night. Good night. If you want to shoot - - Just click where. So try to keep the camera still while watching. There you go Rebecca? We must take - Why? They have seen some people outside, and they are afraid that they will make noise I thought it was safe here. There has been some friction between some clans lately. You get 10-15 minutes, so we must take Steph? Can I take a picture? Rebecca, we must leave now. Steph, come now. Hurry. Come Rebecca! Now! Rebecca! Get in! Bring Steph back, I 'll be here.

Get in the car! I take responsibility for my own safety. I know exactly what I'm doing. You drive my daughter out of here! Get off me! The camp is not protected. Where is the protection for these guys? We do everything we can. How can the UN allow this to happen? - They are not protected, they need it. - I have spoken to the UN in a year I 'll say it again. But we are of little use if we die, Rebecca I'll send pictures soon to New York. You must promise never to do such a thing again. I have to send these photos Steph? Steph? - I'm sorry you were so scared. - I was not afraid I'm sorry I'm just tired. They send more security forces. There is power in your photos. Do not tell daddy. If it yesterday.

She can not do out there alone. Neither do I. Cats have nine lives. Did not you know? Perhaps there? There is something wrong with Steph. What? I do not know. Can we talk about what happened in Africa? No. I think it's time I talk to your dad. No. How are your photos? Can I see? It's nice. Rebecca, we must leave now. Run! Now... Come, now. Now! Now!
