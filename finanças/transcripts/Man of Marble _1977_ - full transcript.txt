The song is on our lips again. SP, hey, SP. Two inseparable sisters, The youth and SP. Crashing waves call us to the seaside, Warsaw calls us with a song. Our spades will ring along the paths of old Piast glory. Crashing waves call us to the seaside, Warsaw calls us with a song. Our spades will ring along the paths of old Piast glory. This is a movie that you want to make. However, we must ask ourselves: do I need it as a TV editor? Does the TV need it, do the viewers need it? Anyway, there are major obstacles, hundreds of traps, unexplained matters, too murky, it's the 1950s after all. It has never been shown on the screen, - it's not been touched... - And why do you take me for a fool? This is just a job for me. I don't want to do just anything, because it's diploma work and needs to be dealt with quickly. I can't start another movie. Just make me retire right away! I have to do it. My dear, you must do it. The choice of director is also crucial, it must be a good one and you're quite young, we'll give you another movie. So you're going to take an old man, he'll direct it for you because he knew it all, he saw, he was there, he knows everything, but... this is my story. Anyway, I've already started the movie. You see, I'd like you to do something else. I am concerned about steel - you should shed some light on this issue. This is a real issue. This is what we find interesting, important. Anyway, there is nothing false there - sheer truth. - It's very important. - But it's my father's youth. - I know everything about it! - Excuse me. - Listen to me. - But it's not what it's about. Dear sir, I have now such contacts, such materials. I've conducted some interviews. This is the kind of material that may bring about unexpected results, don't you see it? I believe it's a topic which may interest us: - the youth, you... - Miss Agnieszka, you disregard the facts. For me one steelworks is fact, another steelworks, people who work there, figures. - 6,5 million tons of steel yearly... - And why didn't you arrange for me the reels that I had asked for? Oh, no, my dear, you're trying to get pointlessly involved in a mess you won't be able to get out of. It will bury you, me, the movie. The materials are top secret. They were not released, aren't now and won't ever be. No one will release them. Don't underestimate this important issue. Just understand it. - How old are you? - 28. - And you have 21 days to complete shooting. - You're welcome! MAN OF MARBLE screenplay design Welcome. We're from the TV, someone was supposed to call you. Yes, the director notified me and asked me to help you. But it's Monday today, we're closed to the public, so there is very little light. Actually, what is this film supposed to be about? The director is very curious. Have you got a screenplay? Oh, I do. This way, please. This way. camera director - Take care of her, will you? - OK, Miss Agnieszka. - And there? What's in there? - There is nothing interesting. Oh, this our oldest collection. - From before the war? - No, from some twenty years ago. We are the only institution to buy works of art. Who else? Art clubs? - Were they ever presented? - Excuse me? Naturally. - You didn't see them? - I didn't go to exhibitions then, I was born in 1952. Where are you going? Excuse me. Let's not go in there, there is nothing there, let's go back upstairs. I'll just take a look around, OK? - But what are you after, actually? - Let me explain. - You see... - What are you looking for? - We're making a movie, you see. - Well, but... you know... - What about the light here? - I'll manage somehow. We have to lift it up, put the camera on a tripod. What tripod?! Camera! Well, my dear daughter... Ready. I like this one too. A very peculiar taste. May I ask why you are so much interested in this one? There are works of greater masters here after all. I don't know. It doesn't matter anyway. May I take a picture? Pictures? Here? Dear madam, the director is very much against even letting anyone in here. Opening of the academic year. Good morning. Please, start the material. Good morning. Can you hear me? Yes, we do. Good morning, we're ready. - Good morning. - Good morning. Maybe I should ask the office to get you a room at the Forum hotel. It will really be much cheaper than sleeping in this place. - Good morning. - Good morning. I have chosen more or less everything about your bricklayer. - Just as you asked. - Well, more or less. More or less, this material is over 25 years old and it's not easy to bring back everything but it should be enough. Here you are. Excuse me, will you be sitting there or here with me? I don't know if you can choose anything from the material. They are not very interesting, actually. This is supposed to be your diploma work? It is. Do you think it's not interesting enough? I am not here to think. I am here to edit things. - What did you do at school? - Etudes. Etudes: naturally, based on Cortazar. Or with your own screenplay? - Agnieszka. - Nice to meet you. - What did you do? - Well, I did something. Ah, I know. It must have been the real life thing - a camera hidden in a caretaker's lodge. I must say that the TV likes it very much, the audience a little less but... As I see it you will certainly get a job here. If you're ready, let's start. And what is this going to be? Ah, yes, a profile, I forgot. Birkut's profile - a fascinating topic. Do you know him, actually? No, I've never seen him. I've only seen the sculpture. You could have chosen someone more handsome. Actually, why did you choose him? I don't know, maybe because he was toppled. If you choose anything, please, tell me. It would be nice to do it right away, it's difficult to get a projection room now. - I'll try. - These are left-overs. They were never used in any movie. Naturally, for technical reasons. Just a moment, it's called "The Beginning of the City" isn't it? It was supposed to be "The Beginning of the City". The director Burski was making the movie. It was supposed to be his diploma work too. Dear madam, I did not edit anything out because, look away now, there will be a part with that Birkut of yours. From the rejects. Oh, please, look. He is the next one. Well, I may be wrong. Ah no, I'm not wrong. It's him. Name? - Birkut. - First name? - Mateusz. - Origin? From the country... from Leńcze, it's a village near Kraków. - Your parents? - Well... they live there. - What does your father do? - Well, he owns land. Much of it? Not much. And what have you done so far? Have you worked anywhere? - On land. - So you don't know anything? But I do... On land. What is going on here? I don't get it. I think it's about the fish. I love fish. If one small fish was to serve as your whole lunch... I see. I hadn't known that Burski did such things. Unfortunately, he stopped very quickly. You'll see a fragment of his movie in a minute... A fragment of his movie "They Are Building our Happiness". Naturally, I chose everything that concerns Birkut. The rest is very similar, anyway. Gentlemen, are you ready? Let's start. You're welcome, we may start. In the lavishly decorated hall of the Warsaw Polytechnics the people to whom our country should be the most grateful gathered to greet the New Year: representatives of the party and the government, heroes of socialist labour, leading farmers, teachers, and scientists. Let us take a look at one of them. Mateusz Birkut. The famous hero of socialist labour from the Nowa Huta steelworks. "Who does not yield to the enemy, who wants to build a new home for the people. He is with us, he is our brother. He is brave, he is a hero". Mateusz Birkut came from a poor village in Kraków region. He joined thousands of other in the war for a better future. "There is one good way - Union of Polish Youth ZMP". The song is on our lips again. SP, hey, SP. New major steelworks is being built near Kraków - it is called Nowa Huta. A city for 100 thousand workers is built nearby. Our spades will ring along... Hundred of workers arrive daily from every corner of Poland. Volunteer brigades of ZMP and SP take part in the gigantic task. "Because it is where they see their future. SP, hey, SP! Join us to lay the foundations of the new Poland". The construction site grows and the people grow with it. They are not left alone, the management gave them a helping hand. They had at their disposal spacious workers' hostels where after their work they could get a decent rest, talk, read books. Mateusz Birkut- it was in this great factory under construction that our hero began his career with other young volunteers. Watched over by experienced bricklayers, the hero of socialist labour Ożański and others, Mateusz Birkut learned the difficult and beautiful art of bricklaying. Who wants to deserve the noble name of a builder of Nowa Huta must work not only with his hands but also with his head. The builders of Nowa Huta were given a chance to continue with their education. Mateusz Birkut took advantage of this opportunity: he worked, learned, expanded his knowledge. In the Workers' Sport Club he met his future wife. Our viewers know her well but let us remind you. Hanka Tomczyk, the pride and glory of Nowa Huta sport. She also began like all others. It was here that she learned to live and work. The landscape changes. Where once there were meadows there grows the most powerful undertaking of the 6 year plan - Nowa Huta. The arrival of president Bierut was a major holiday for the workers of the steelworks. A moving welcome, applause, handshakes. Many have dreamt of this joyful moment. Leader Hanka Tomczyk feels honored. We all gave our best, comrade president. It was then that Mateusz Birkut took the noble challenge of his colleagues, bricklayers from other construction sites. Thirty thousand bricks during one shift - that was his watchword. This is where it happened. It takes extremely good labour management to achieve such results. Just take a look. Everything works perfectly well in this team. Naturally, this kind of work attracted many onlookers. Everybody watches attentively. Will they make it? They did - 30.509 bricks. The heroic five reaches their goal. And now is the time for flowers and applause. This was the beginning of a long road towards more victories. Comrades trusted Mateusz Birkut. He was their representative at the construction workers congress. And at the All Poland Heroes of Socialist Labour Assembly. We must not be surprised that people like Birkut were an inspiration for our artists. The creation of a marble sculpture-symbol. Embodiment of the heroism of our bricklayers. The Zachęta Hall in Warsaw. The 2nd All Poland Art Exhibition. The man whose image was cast in marble opens the exhibition the sculpture is a focal point of the exhibition. Mateusz Birkut may state with satisfaction: we have helped a major revolution in Polish art. It is true, they not only helped it, they became its strength, material and content. Polish people entered the canvasses of Polish artists. Take a look at the degeneration of these works of artists from the capitalist West. It is not by chance that the human figure looses in their hands its human shape and human meaning. "We're building a new house, yet another new house for our future better days, Warsaw! Multiply each of our endeavors, share with us all our work, this is our common goal, Warsaw! May the building grow joyfully from the cellar to the roof for ours and your dreams, Warsaw! May the walls rise up higher when the hands are willing..." Here comes Kraków - and with the ancient city of the Piasts comes her youngest sister Nowa Huta, a contemporary of the 6 year plan. "Through the fighting countries there come boys and girls, strong, radiant, courageous. Stand by our side! Join the march! Our hands are bound by brotherly bonds. We shall win the fight for lasting peace..." The Trumanillo Circus was the source of much joy. Mister Truman and his friends: various rats and reactionary vermin. Eisenhower and Adenauer as newlyweds. Franco careening, dressed up as Carmen from the famous opera. They are followed by MacArthur kicked out of Korea. Hundreds of hands reach for the daily news printed in the van. They symbolically represent millions of hands which in the People's Republic could reach for the first time for a book or a newspaper. "This is a song about Nowa Huta, a melody of Nowa Huta, it is so simple and beautiful, the nicest of all melodies". The long awaited day has come. The door to an apartment of their own finally opens. One of the apartments they built with their own effort. Mateusz and Hanka Birkut - now in their own home. We shouldn't be surprised at their emotions. It's true, they made it all together. There is a drop of their sweat in each of these houses. "The sun of days of liberty shall shine on you, comrades, as well. Our song rings with joy. Our song - the flame of youth. It flies over a free country on a July morning, when factory sirens wake up the new day. A new clear day is born in our vast and clean fatherland". - Is this all? - All. Please, set it up for me. Almost all, with a small addition which I found in newsreels. When you're ready, let's roll. Just a moment, we're setting it up. There is no sound because the material was never used. Naturally, for technical reasons. - We're starting. - Let's go. Don't you know what happened? You see, I am here to cut and edit the materials, I am really not here to deal in saints' lives. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Maybe you know what happened to him? Well, this is what we are going to learn from your diploma work. I saw the movie about Birkut, "They Built our Happiness". You must have seen it, Mr. Leonard. Well, there is my material there. - But it was Burski who directed it. - He did and he edited the film, as far as I know. But it was, my dear... I'm sorry, he even got awarded for this movie. It was a long time ago, 24 years ago, my dear. - I'd like to talk to him. - Quite right, Miss Agnieszka. Director Burski likes to support young talents. Oh, Jesus! Wouldn't you know if he is in Warsaw now? What? Ah, he should be coming back from some international festival. I heard that our colleagues went to welcome him at the airport. Very well, one should listen to what people say. What is it, Mr. Leonard? What are you worried about? What am I to say, Miss Agnieszka. It is all very hard. I'd like to work some more, you see. This is going to be my last movie, I can feel it. I have written to the minister asking for work, so that I could continue in my profession. But so far I haven't heard back. We're ready! Well, Mr. Leonard, let's go. But no shooting with a tripod, OK? - But... - Only hand-shooting, OK? Have you seen any new American movies? Well, this is what I mean. Good afternoon. - I am so glad that finally... - Thank you. Dear sir, my part was... My part was very minor. I was only a member of the jury. I am very glad that I could help with this success. But it's their work first of all, isn't it? Yes, naturally, but so far you were the author of most of the international successes of our cinematography. Thank you very much for such a high opinion of my work but I keep telling you, it's their time, here you are. Thank you so much, thank you. I spoke to this young lady. Everything is OK the only problem is the holiday season. Excuse me, - may I ask for your autograph? - You're welcome. - And one more for a friend. - Here you are. Thank you. Come on, Wiciu, speak up. And this is why she doesn't know if she can leave or act. - The casting is the only... - But she must act. Listen, you have to sign this immediately, without this - I won't get the permit. - OK, OK, now I am signing something else. Listen, this is important. I can't start the shooting. - Sign here. - Give it here, I will. Thank you. There is this lady from the TV, she'd like to speak to you. But I'm leaving today. I'm going to Prague. Yes, I know. The tickets are booked already. What is it? It's you, right? You wanted to talk to me? Just don't ask me how was the trip or about the quality of the festival. Just say something personal, please. - I'm pursuing a diploma. - A diploma? A diploma movie. And what is it to be? Just a story. I called it "Stars of a Season", good title? You mean sportsmen or movie stars? No, it's going to be about the former heroes of socialist labour. A bit of modernity and a bit of history. But in the past there were no heroes of socialist labour. You know for me such a hero is as ancient as an insurgent of 1863. - Which is why I want to make this movie. - It's touching. And I would play a grandpa, I'd sit by some fireplace and tell you everything about such a distant past, when we built Warsaw, Nowa Huta? It's so touching. But it's impossible, I'm leaving today. I know, for Prague. Well? Maybe after I return? No. What are you doing in the afternoon? Me? Many things. Well. Goodbye. It's a pity. You knew Birkut. Birkut? Knew? He was my greatest discovery. Please, get back. What? This was my greatest stroke of luck. - Do you think that this Birkut now... - I don't think anything, I just got interested. The story of a single career and what came next. The story of a single career, right? First some newsreels from the archives. If you let me use them. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Interviews in front of the camera. Cinéma vérité. But it's been done already, come in, please. I saw one of your early movies. Which one? - "They Are Building Our Happiness"? - No, "The Beginning of the City". It's a pity you never finished the movie. Excuse me but do you want to make a movie about Birkut or about me? Marysia! I don't get soppy about my own "what next". Anna Maria! Marysia! Maryśka! - Dear daughter. Come, come, come. - Daddy! She forgot her doggy. And what is the doggy called? Tell me, my dear. And where is my wife? - Your wife left this morning to make a movie. - When is she coming back? Late, I think, she is to record the sound later on. Film, my dear colleague, especially a documentary, is not literature. Nothing can be done for tomorrow. It's either today or never. One must know what is important. Have this awareness. If today... you see, I was young once, I had as many years as you have today and I also had to start somehow. For two years I couldn't finish a single movie - everything was too bleak. And I got wiser, finally. And you had your breakthrough with Birkut. You see, actually, I wanted to make a movie about somebody else, but all the better ones were well taken care of, you see, I had... You see, I had older colleagues. And each real record breaker was closely watched. Marysia! Marysia! What is it? So I had to come up with something. Excuse me, is my wife... Would like to have a drink? Thank you, then. So I had to come up with something. And I invented that Birkut. I only had a very vague idea. It was more about the facts than a specific person. It was only in Nowa Huta that I saw it clearly. I used to go there often. I made short newsreels for the Kronika Filmowa. - Good morning, comrade Jodła. - What is it? What are you going to shoot today? We have new showers. - Showers? - Well, hot water, soap is free. Toilet soap, I guess. Violet scented. - I'll wait until you start giving out shampoo. - What is it about? - You'll sign it later. - OK, OK. The trade union congress is coming. And what will you bring? Are you serious! All this! We're building. You are, it's true. But it's hardly a number. - And what is? - Bulgotny is. Stupał is. 10 thousand bricks during one shift. Not just: we're building. We appreciate it, comrade. But records are good for special occasions. And we here have good specialists, decent technology and organization on an everyday basis - In the longer run... - Oh, the longer run. Anyway, one does not get in the way of the other. Do me a show with 30 thousand. 30 thousand... Comrade, you have two hands. Now imagine that a bricklayer also has two hands. I would have to get him two more for the purpose. Mr. Jodła, I know nothing about bricklaying. You tell me what is the system of three? - Do you want the long story or the short one? - The short one. So it's like this: once a bricklayer worked on his own, now he has two men to assist him. - Assistant and help. - And they can lay 20 thousand bricks together? Maybe they can, maybe they can't. I've never seen it. But in the newspapers they claim that they can. So get him 4, 6, 10 assistants. The whole company should carry the bricks. And I will shoot it. It was only in Nowa Huta that I saw him clearly. Yes... We have to choose a man, a real man! Who can go on for eight hours and never fail. Who will make it? Adamowski? Stępniak? Later on you can get him summer holidays in Krynica. Just a moment, don't get ahead of yourself. The assistants should also be the best. Anyway, we'll have to maintain secrecy... Are you mad? You want to build a house in secret? In secret. Anyway, just an hour. Everything else depends on the organisation. You see, when you get them special conditions! Maybe we can manage somehow. It's midnight. Midnight, Birkut. - What is it? - You're not gonna wake up tomorrow. I will, secretary. I can do a lot when necessary. There must be five of us. Don't you think you can find five lunatics on such a construction site? We can't make any blunders. 30 thousand is a major pile of bricks. We'll lay them. That's OK. I just don't want this to turn into some kind of circus. - What kind of circus? - A circus for those guys from the movies. Vittorio, do you think I'm doing this for the movies? I'm doing it for myself. I'd like to see if we can make it. If we can build a house in two weeks. - Maybe in a week? - Who knows, maybe in a week. Everyone would have a place to live. It wouldn't be so bad. - It wouldn't, I agree. - You're in? Well, go to sleep now. I won't fall asleep anyway. Start counting bricks, it might help. - 10 thousand calories daily! - How long has this been going on? For two weeks. What is it, Birkut? Eat. I've had enough. One more slice, for the director. I can't any more! - Coffee? - No, I don' like it, it's sour. Sour or not, you have to drink it. It'll give you strength. - Half. - Everything. Genuine. From Brazil. You see, I have prepared perfect conditions. - I can start now. - He can start! - With this face? - Wipe yourself. This is not what it is about, he must be shaved. Everyone must be shaved. Don't let anyone come here unshaven. I shave on Sundays, it's Thursday today. - What time is it? - It's late. We'll make it. Hello! Send a car to the city immediately. They must bring all the barbers they can find. Jodła! All barbers. Tell them to bring the razors. We'll have a big shaving! - Ties? - No, no, no! Well, all right! A cigarette? It's a Belvedere. Birkut, it's good that you're here. There are some more technical details we should discuss. You see, the camera works according to its own rules. It's a soulless tool which records what it sees, nothing else. You could have told me to shave yesterday. The barbers will soon be here. The point is to show you as well as we can. - Without your help... - I understand it, but... Well, but you just can't do such things. It's enough to tell me what needs to be done and I'll do it. I am a human being. You can't stuff food into a man as if he was a goose. OK, let's have a deal: I won't get in the way, and when I say "camera", you'll be working as if you were singing a song - light, easy. And when I say "stop", you can work as you like. Do we have a deal? Well, I'll manage. Cool. I have checked everything, we're clear. - Who is this guy? - Oh, don't you know? If anything happens... It's better to watch out. Maybe I can do it myself? Can I do it myself? - Some water? - Some water? - Some is fine. - OK! - Is this all right now? - OK. - And now to the shed. - Where to? - The shed. - But why? I can't shoot them leaving the office. - Let the people in. - Faster, faster. - Seven, six, five, four, three... - Let the people in! One. This is Polish Radio directly from the construction site of the housing estate Nowa Huta. Dear listeners, we are at the largest construction site of the 6 Year Plan. In the fields near Kraków where the huge steelworks Nowa Huta is under construction there grows the city that will soon have 100 thousand inhabitants. Before the hands of Polish workers will operate Russian machines of the steelworks, today Polish bricklayers face an ambitious challenge. - Now? - Now! Now! Yes! No, no, no! More energetically! More boldly! More at ease, like real workers. Mr. Birkut walks the right way, but you are too stiff. Stop! Stop! No, it isn't it. Let's go back. We'll do it again. The five man team of Mateusz Birkut took up the challenge to lay 28 thousand bricks during a single shift. Now we shall witness this extraordinary undertaking. It was Mateusz Birkut who suggested that in a team of five one qualified bricklayer lays only the external layer of bricks, directing the work of other four who are responsible for any other tasks. Attention! A single bricklayer could lay no more than 1750 bricks during an eight hour long shift. Mateusz Birkut with his team aims to lay 28 thousand bricks. All those present participate in the joyful, serene mood. - We look at Mateusz Birkut's team. - You can start. Everyone is ready to get on with their work. - Attention! - They're only waiting for the signal. Start! What are you doing? Stop! - One more take. - Start now. Go to the office. The race against time has begun. What an exemplary team work, what an eagerness with which the young men take up their difficult task. Joyfully! Joyfully! Cool. We are watching their hard work and we all realize that we wouldn't be able to achieve so much if it wasn't for our heroic working class which works ceaselessly for the fatherland. But here are the first results. The time necessary for the first layer was - cut down by three minutes, - Attention! We're rolling, Mr. Birkut. - and in the second layer by four minutes. - Smile! - And a close up. - It's just unbelievable. And it seems that the rhythm of the work increases still. To lay 28 thousand bricks they must lay 12 layers of the walls 2321 bricks each. And 148 bricks in the thirteenths layer. The challenge accepted by Mateusz Birkut is a revelation, which may result in a breakthrough in the current bricklaying technology. What we see here is not just the foundation of a block of flats, it is the foundation of a better life of the working classes. Gentlemen, what is it? Have you fallen asleep? Play! Come on, play! Gentlemen, what is it? Come here! Quickly! Maestro! You have to play! Faster! One, two! Come on! The sixth layer. The fourth hour of work comes to a close. 13,926 bricks have been laid so far. Faster! More joyfully! Birkut, come on. More joyfully, come on! What is it, gentlemen! Faster! Everyone is waiting for you. Faster! Take position on this hillock. And play! Come on, play! OK. Dear listeners, it is the seventh hour of work. The tenth layer is completed. 23,210 bricks have been laid. Come on, Birkut. Just one hour to go. What is it? You're doing great. - I fear for them. - But it's going great! They'll manage. Now they fight not just against the time but against their own weakness and fatigue. Only minutes are left to reach the final goal. Last bricks. Last effort. - We've run out of mint-tea. - But we're doing great. This way, please. The end of the shift! 30,509 bricks! - The end! - We've made it! An unbelievable record. Mateusz Birkut with his team not only laid the predicted amount of 28 thousand bricks but exceeded the number considerably. He looks at the results: 30,509 bricks. Congratulations. Everyone is moved. The end! The end of the shift! The end of the shift! Come on, Birkut! Our congratulations. We and all present are deeply moved. Congratulations! What a man. I've always believed in him. What a man. Yes, comrades. We'll shoot the congratulations once more. - Take the flowers. - Wait, wait, we need to... - We need to do it once again. - Move over there. Birkut! Repeat the two last movements and walk towards the comrades. Come on, let's go. So we have yet another success in our fight for the 6 Year Pan. And for peace. - Congratulations! - Now, now, congratulations! - Bravo. - Yes, yes, good, yes. And now move on, walk there. Go on, I'll show you everything. You'll get far, Birkut. I'll take care of that. I will keep this brick as souvenir. Keep it. You must admit that I kept my word - he did get far. - You both did. - Well, we did. - It's just that he... - Where is he now? You're making a movie about a man and you don't know where he is? I had this idea - to follow in his footsteps. It's interesting but I've already seen such a movie. It doesn't matter, please, go on. Well, I lost touch with him. I had a lot of work. I travelled a lot, you see. Would you like to have lunch with us? Thank you. I saw a fragment of newsreel when they were taking down his portraits - why? Well, sometimes they put them up, sometimes they take them down. So it goes. Just a moment. He hired Gypsies. They followed him everywhere and played. - He broke some window pane. - Where? I don't know. Look for him and you'll know. Many people knew him after all. - Who did know him? - I'll give you an address. - Write me some recommendation. - It's very close. I'll give you my recommendation. Are you leaving? You have such a big bag. No, it's all I have. - Not much. - It's enough, this way it's easier to make movies. Maybe you're right. One, two, three, one, two. Let me hear it. Well. Just watch out, this must be audible. OK. - One, two, three, do you hear me? - I do, I do. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, hold it. - What is it? - Please, open, I have to go home. Here you are. Just a moment, don't push! Not all of you at once. Where are you going? I have a letter to director Michalak. - And who are you? - He's my daddy. Gentlemen, don't push! You know you're not allowed. Where are we going? What are you doing? - Hush! - What are you doing? What for? - She's a lunatic! - Hush! You go there. Excuse me, director Michalak? Unfortunately not. Excuse me, director Michalak? - Yes, it's me. - I have a letter for you. - Strip-tease or topless? - Anything if you help me. OK but undress, please. Please, listen. I'm making a movie. I spoke to director Burski. He said you were the only person who could help me. I'm in deep trouble, this is my diploma film. - Please, understand me, I beg of you. - I do understand. - Please, talk to me. - I see but not now. I was told you were the only one... Let's arrange to meet later - I will tell you everything... - I see but, please, talk to me for a minute. I beg of you, just five minutes. Well, they have their ideals. Just a bit of fat and you're out. She may break into pieces if she falls down. OK. The young people are more healthy, better looking these days. You're interested in a man called - Birkut, is it true? - Yes, yes, exactly. It's good, young people should be interested in the history of their fathers. And learn from their mistakes. - Well, I'm listening. - I'd rather listen to you. You know what period of Birkut's life I am interested in. - I guess after the burn. - The burn? Yes, before the burn everything was all right. I mean, he didn't actually lay bricks. He didn't have the time. Anyway, he was made an inspector in the company. Did you know it? I didn't. Even then I thought he wasn't cut out for the job. - But why? I don't get it. - Well, the job of an inspector. He took everything too literally. But what does it mean... I don't get it. What do you mean: literally? In what sense? Well... May I ask for a cigarette? Naturally. Certainly, some of his initiatives were valuable. Protective shoes. Canteen. But later... Although when you look at it from a contemporary point of view... Even myself... Although... Anyway, I don't know. Anyway, after the accident he lost it completely. The accident took place during Birkut's last trip. He would often go to distant places to make a presentation of team bricklaying. It was very exhausting so we organised such trip quite seldom. If the place was well prepared, he would go on his own, if it wasn't, he would take his assistants. Brotherly bonds join our hands. We shall win the fight for lasting peace. We raise our hands against the enemies of freedom! Let's go together, young Slavs! Let's go, Greeks, Spaniards! A young Chinese joins our march. Other will join us soon, black brothers from Virginia, the heroic Malays will go with us. - Listen! - What is it? Boys from the neighboring village joined the brigade. Two of them got to work and the third one laughed. Hard work doesn't pay, I prefer to lie on the grass! Relaxing under the bushes, this is Michalak's job. This is what Lech said, this is what Lech said. This is a song of Nowa Huta, these are words of Nowa Huta. It is simple and beautiful, and as new as Nowa Huta. - What is it? - We're there. There you are. We're so glad... - It's good that you're here, comrades. - They're waiting for you. Just a moment... Vittorio! Together. Just a moment. This way, please. - Vittorio! - I'm coming. Well. Well. Who will go first? - I. - Second? - Second. - Fifth. Start! Stop! Don't move! Move aside! To the hospital! I'll get him, you'll see! Don't move. Good evening, comrade Birkut. You're not asleep. I can understand you. It's not easy to sleep after such a thing. Did they dress the burn well? Put on some iodine? No. - No? - They just poured some water. - Hydrogen peroxide. - Maybe. We'll check that. Does it hurt? It certainly does. You thought it wouldn't, didn't you? How could a worker do such a thing to another worker? Don't people understand us? They want houses, don't they? We won't built them in a century with the old methods. We increase the norms. People don't like it. And when you were passing the brick to your comrade, didn't you feel it was hot? - I work in gloves. - In gloves? - Thick? - Just so. Just so? Have you had this sciatica for long? Me? Oh, I just said it so that they'd let me be. I have some rash. Eczema or whatever they call it, I don't know. Eczema? Show me your hands. Come on, right now. Show me your hands! - Are you mad? - So? Is it there? What is it, gentlemen? Can't you tell a joke or what? Listen, who are you? You follow us everywhere, you won't let us sleep. Leave us alone, will you? I'm leaving right now. Excuse me. Good night, comrades. And if you need anything, just call me. Birkut couldn't work at the construction site. His health wouldn't let him. He got totally involved in social work. His special passion were apartments for workers. He literally fought for each and every one. He would force the management to yield. He would quarrel with the department for months. He almost always won. And then he was really happy. He supervised each removal personally. People loved him, without any exaggeration adored him. Mateusz! - Hi. - Hi. Can you spare a moment? - No, I'm busy. Just a moment, OK? - Come here for a moment. - So what do you think? - We'll go there together. - Stop fooling around, I'll go on my own. - No, we'll go there together. - I'll go there alone, I'll come back alone. Give it to me. - No, we're going together. You'll go there alone, you'll make some mess. Come on, let's go. Yes? OK. Yes? No, no. No, I do remember. Yes? OK. Yes. Yes. Yes? It's done. Yes, it's done. Can you ask if I may go in there. There? But of course you may. I was just wondering why you were waiting for so long. Comrade colonel will see you right now. Come in, please. What an honor to welcome you here. Come in, comrade Birkut, come in. Coffee? Excuse me, where is the comrade who came in here? What comrade? Ah, that bricklayer? He left a long time ago. - Left? - Naturally. Did you see the comrade who came here with comrade Birkut, and then left? I'm very sorry, I was rather busy, I wasn't looking. But I was surprised that this comrade was walking and walking as if waiting for someone. But I didn't have the courage to ask. Exactly. You see. I am sometimes so tired I don't know where my own head is. Well, anyway. Would you like a cigarette? You still wear a bandage? Something is the matter? The wound got infected... - For so long? - Well, I got it dirty. There things to do at the construction site. I had to get to bricklaying again. - Ah, so. - It hasn't been well since. Strange. They dress it and dress it and it doesn't get better. Where is Witek? Bricklayer Wincenty Witek, he came here with me. What have you done to him? Comrade Birkut, you haven't had holidays for a long time, have you? Maybe it's time for you to visit the mountains? Get some rest? If you are in trouble, I'll be glad to help. Would Krynica be OK? Maybe Zakopane? So? You'll regret it. I will check everywhere. If need be, I'll go to Warsaw. You'll come to regret it. You'll see. The autumn came. The autumn came and it started to rain all the time. Birkut still fought for the release of Witek. He went to all the offices on the local and provincial level. Finally, he took a leave of absence and decided to go to Warsaw. It wasn't a good moment to leave. His wife was pregnant, she had some pains and wasn't feeling well. And the general situation was very bad. Letters arrive or they don't. I must go. Wait. I must. - Mateusz, I beg of you, don't. - But I must. - Go now. - No. I'm not going. - Go now. - I won't. May I ask you here? Could you spare me a minute? I want to say this in private. As a friend. You don't like me but I always have liked you and very much so. When you had the first show for the movies, I couldn't eat all night, I couldn't sleep. You are a role model for my son. Because I have son. He has a triple name. Józef Bolesław Bartłomiej. - Bartłomiej? - Oh, it's after my father in law. You know, if you like me, leave me alone, will you? - I've already asked you this much. - I can't, the enemy never sleeps. You don't understand it and this is why you make such a mess. You're making a horrible mess, comrade Birkut. Let me give you a completely private piece of advice. This is an ugly case, very ugly, leave it alone. Bullshit, I know Witek. Witek is an honest man. An honest man. Do you know they called him Vittorio? So what? He was in Spain, they called him so there. - Precisely, in Spain. - So? Not good? Why not? Very good. But later on, when it was over, where was he? - In France. In a camp. - You see. You are young, comrade, you don't know what went on there. All the intelligence agencies were active there. Very active. They enlisted him and then everything was quiet. Nothing for ten years and then, suddenly, a cable. - Pass the brick. - What brick? This kind of a brick, comrade Birkut. Let me take you home. Come on, let's go. Mateusz! Mateusz! Your train is about to leave. Bye. When I come back, everything will be different. I prepared for you some cake with plums. It turned out quite thin. I'm not sure you'll like it. I certainly will. Be careful. Well, comrade Birkut, you managed to reach me although it's not easy. My day lasts only for 24 hours just as yours. - But you must understand: front, ideological fight. - Yes, I understand, I do. So please forgive me but I'll be brief. I know your case and I will try to deal with it. - Is it enough? - Excuse me, comrade, but you see, I'm not from Warsaw, I came from Nowa Huta. - I know. - You see, I'd like to go back - with something more substantial. - Comrade Birkut, don't be childish. There is a political war in our country. We act in difficult circumstances. Very often we're forced to act quickly. - But Witek... - Don't stop me, comrade Birkut. I don't have the time for idle talk. If we made a mistake, we'll try to set it right. Such things happen and we react immediately. And as far as you are concerned, I'd like to ask you one thing: don't do anything on your own. Leave it all to us. OK? And trust people's justice. - I do, comrade, but Witek... - I repeat, don't do anything on your own. I know the matter, the case is in progress, everything will be settled. I set up a special committee, we won't let anyone get harmed. And you, comrade Birkut, just wait for the results, will you? So... PART II He was back after a week, he looked thin and tired. There was a trade union meeting in the new club. He went there straight from the railway station, he didn't even shave. Socialism can win in the minds of the workers thanks to simple examples. We do not seek to conquer any nation, we have friends in every nation, millions of workers, farmers, intelligentsia - who look enchanted at... - Let me speak. Hey, you, let me speak. I'm talking to you. You're not on the list of speakers. - So what? - Anyway, there will be a movie soon - and they said it was very funny. - Just a few words, it's very important. - Let me speak, please. - Mateusz, are you a baby? If the relations are on equal terms. The text hasn't been approved, nobody read it... How do you want to speak?! Comrade Birkut! I won't allow this! Please, step down right now! People! Listen to me! - It is about our comrade, Wincenty Witek. - Switch off the mike. You all know him. You know what kind of man he is. He was horribly wronged. People, I've been everywhere, I've tried everything. I was here and in Warsaw. If you, comrades, don't do anything, if you don't help... People! Forward, young Poles, hard work shall unite us today. Let's join the labour brigades, unite our hearts and thoughts. Let's raise from ruins the country, a new house is growing. Give us your hand, brother from afar, may our loud song resound. We shall build new cities, new villages. Give us a hand, may friendship unite us. A few days later I took my bike and without saying a word, even to my wife, I went to see the Birkuts. I knew what had happened, so I was not surprised to see what had happened in the square. Did you really need it, dear comrade? And I warned you. Listen, it can still be reversed, taken back. It's not like everything is lost. Such a good comrade, hero of socialist labour. Reiterate, comrade. Hanka, the keys. I beg of you, privately: reiterate. I do all I can, both in my written and oral reports. Someone tried to rat on you but I just destroyed the letter. But how long can one go on like this? They are sniffing around you. Let them sniff, I am clean. It's easy to say. Who threw fish at the management two years ago? Fish, comrade, fish. - Waiter! - At your service. I want to pay. Don't touch this! One, two, three, four, 79,48. - What are you giving me? - Money. What money? 78 złotych. - It's not enough. - Watch. - What is it? What is it? - Take it. Minister. Coat! Let's go. "Bricklayers' waltz". Take it... Let's make it even. Do you really want to make an honest movie about those days? - I do. - Really? - I'm trying as you can see. - Can you give me your word of honor? Yes. I have no secrets. Well, give me the tape, please. - So what? - Shit. Are you giving him the tape? Quiet, please! You know that one can't shoot in here. These are amateurs, they did not agree to be filmed. You'll find the rest in your archives. There was someone from the newsreels, I saw it myself. - "Ski Jumping Hill" case, you should write it down. - No, I'll remember. Here you are. Well, goodbye. And do you personally believe that Witek was guilty? Comrade Witek was cleared of all the charges and he has a very high position now so, please, don't ask any more tricky questions. You know that one can't talk about it in my room. What is going on? Where did you go? - Where are going? What were you doing in Kongresowa? - I'm collecting materials. Where? There? Among strip-teasers? Have mercy, girl. What do you need it for? Why do you get involved? People keep calling me. Complaints, fights. This is not what we agreed upon. What are you doing? There was a man I wanted to talk to. And may he go to hell! What do you need one man for?! Bad addresses! Bad ideas! Bad concepts - no concept at all. Where are you going? Where are you wandering? Anyway, these methods are wrong. - Stop these scouting games. - But if I warned him the meeting would have looked completely different. But you got nothing out of it, no effects, no results. It gave you nothing. Anyway, I repeat: stop pretending you're in America. These are not the right methods, don't be so fascinated with them, - it is some scouting. - I have the tape! Destroyed - this is your tape. No effects. You compromised yourself, the movie, me, everyone. The cause. One can't get anything right with you. I asked you, we had a deal. I beg of you... You mustn't touch certain things. Confidential means confidential and, please, take it seriously. You must take seriously what I'm saying. Not this way. It's not optional. It turns into anarchy. If we can't work this way, we'll find another way. I had an idea and I told you about it. Huta Katowice - there is Wincenty Witek there. Engineer Wincenty Witek, the man we need in this movie. He must be, he is, we can... it can be arranged, it's been arranged. I've done worse things than that. If... And this must be done - unconditionally. - I can't talk to you any more, - I don't have the time. Goodbye. - You're going right to Huta Katowice. If we can't get it in another way, please, take it as an order. Go there. You have an appointment with Wincenty Witek. He'll be waiting for you. You should do it. You should do this interview. No flights of fancy, no freaking out. - No weirdness. - Goodbye! Goodbye. I have prepared for you everything we have about Birkut. However, in the newsreel which we'll just see... - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Birkut does not appear at all. - Naturally. You know that the second material was stopped - outside the factory and it was never... - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. But I am very glad. - Good afternoon. - Really glad that they released it for you. So am I, madam. Come on, kids! Where are you sitting? Move to the back. If you're ready, gentlemen, we may begin the screening. The trial of a group of saboteurs began at the District Court of Justice in Warsaw. The group took the name "Ski Jump Hill". Four people united in a criminal plan: to stop the development of our country. People's Poland gave them, as any of us, opportunities for creative work and unlimited promotion. They rejected the opportunity. They chose treason. Employed in the socialist building industry, trusted by colleagues and comrades, they did all they could to halt the nation's efforts. The list of their crimes is long: starting from forging plans to attempts on the lives of heroes of socialist labour. Today they squirm in the court with tears of false remorse in their eyes. But yesterday they were ready to join forces with Guderian's lackeys, only to harm their fatherland. The prosecutor destroys their lies, showing the connections of the defendants with foreign intelligence agencies. Here they are: Jan Wołodkiewicz - director of the Cooperative North-South, Marcin Pawlusiak - chief inspector, Mieczysław Herc - book-keeper, Wincenty Witek -junior instructor of team brick-laying. The trial is an important lesson for Polish society. We must be vigilant. This was the end of the first day of the trial. Tomorrow and in the following days witnesses will be interrogated. We will show them in the next issue of Polish Newsreels. Naturally, they never saw it. We'll be the first to see it after 24 years. Thank you. The next material, please. The witness testifies without the ceremonial oath as he is under suspicion due to activities connected with those of the defendant Wincenty Witek. Anyway, this does not free the witness from the duty to tell the truth. Yes, your honor. The witness is accused of organizing a terrorist group called "Gypsy Band" and launching an attack against the organs of public safety. Do you know the accusations? - I do. - Do you recognize among those present here, the defendant Wincenty Witek? - I do. - Yes. Defendant Witek pleaded guilty of organising an attempt on your health. Did you know anything about the preparations for the attempt? He confessed? I've just said it and I am asking if you knew anything about the attempt? Of course I did. I knew everything, your honor. Just a moment, I don't think you understand my question. What was there not to understand, it was a very straightforward question. I know everything, I knew it from the very beginning. The witness seems to be mistaken. During the investigation witness testified that he fully trusted the defendant and the defendant abused this trust. Quite the contrary! He was to hit me and I was to hit him - that was the deal. What do you mean: he you and you him - it's stupid. The defendant couldn't have known about your activities. The defendant considered you a devout communist. Quite the contrary. Our organizations were related. They were to hit some heroes of socialist work and so were we, so we decided that instead of looking far and wide, as we were both heroes, we decided to deal with it in the family. I can quote here from the testimonies. The witness testified something completely different. Well, your honor, every enemy is deceitful. And I am horribly so. I have already once attacked the authorities, your honor. And I did with a gudgeon. - What? - Gudgeon. Gudgeon - the fish. - Just a small fish. - However, during the investigation, you gave a completely different testimony, - I can quote it here... - What's the point of quoting, your honor? Don't you know, your honor, why I made these testimonies? Shall I tell your honor what it was like, shan't I? Mateusz, kisses! You can do what you want to me. I take back everything I said. - Take the witness away! - Mateusz, I take it all back! I take it all back! I must tell you, my dear kid, that after what I've just seen, I owe you a small vodka or a big ice-cream, whatever you prefer. You seem to want to say something. Not yet, you know I like to speak last. Here you are, this the material. Delivered personally. Thank you. We'll try to find that Witek. It won't be difficult. People in high places are found before you even start looking for them. Mr. Leonard, as of today only hand-shooting. We have to do something. - Use this. - OK. It is magnificent! But won't we ever touch down? Two more minutes of flight. Here everything goes according to the schedule. Well, almost everything. Please, take a look. This is the most important part of the steelworks. I've seen it already. I need to talk. I know better what you need. - Just take a look. - But you don't have the time. Well, we can talk as well. What are you after in the 1950s? Huta Katowice - this is something for the young. This is a subject for you. In 1980 it will be the most modern steelworks in the world. I beg of you, talk to me! Well, I could begin with the war in Spain. But so without a word about childhood? The formative period is between the 3rd and the 5th year of life, isn't it? I was born in the family of a poor shoemaker... Start from the moment you met Birkut. I meant to get there. I met Birkut at Nowa Huta. Birkut came from a poor village near Kraków. No, later still - after the release from prison. - You were released first. - How do you know? Birkut was released at the end of October. When we learned of his return, we decided to give him an appropriate welcome. We prepared people, flowers, orchestra. And we went to the station. When the door opens, start with gusto. Hurray! Hurray! Lift him up! Long live comrade Birkut! - You will be the leader! - Isn't there anybody else? And where is everyone? Others? - Have all come? - Well, the others... - Let's go to the railway men, OK? Come. - Let's go, let's go. Hurray! Well, old boy, you have to speak now. - No, man. - But everyone has spoken already, - it's your turn now. - No, no, I've spoken enough, - leave me alone. - Mateusz, I beg of you, do it at least for me. This is such a moment that you have to. Come. Are you sure everybody knew about my arrival? I've been announcing it all over the factory since the morning. Everybody knows. Come, tell them like it is. Comrade Birkut, the floor is yours! My dear, thank you so much. It's late. We won't be able to get up tomorrow, I guess, it's time to go home, and tomorrow back to work. What is it? What is it, comrade Birkut? And the errors and perversions? Historical moment? Raison d'état? - Mateusz! - No, it's up to you... Comrades! Comrade Birkut is tired, exhausted. I think we know why. Let him rest, gather his strength. So that he could assist us in our fight. Long live comrade Birkut! Hurray! Hurray! Long live comrade Birkut! How can I help you? Excuse me, what street is this? There are no name-plates anywhere. - You're not from here, are you? - Actually... We, locals, can do without them perfectly well. - We know every nook here. - Yes... is this block C2? Possibly, I don't know, there are numbers like in any other city. And barracks? Are there any barracks left? There are. Go straight forward and then turn left. The third street to the left, behind the flower shop. Then straight again and you'll see them. - Is this all? - Yes, thank you. Mazury, please. - Here you are. - And matches. - Here you are. - Thank you so much. I thought you knew. Here everybody knows. Really? Well, I was certain that... I was sure. You see I haven't had any contact with her for the last three years. It's a shame but... She never wrote to you? Not a word, and it's... Does she have somebody else? It's not like this, she must have felt some remorse and that is why - yesterday... - Why remorse? Listen, forget about her. You know, I understand, the times were different, the national team. She cared for it, naturally, they cared for her, - but to do such things... - What did she do? You see, they made her. And she was stupid enough to listen. She made a public statement that you were an enemy and a lackey. A lackey and an enemy, you see. Let her go. We'll find you a dozen of others. A slut is a slut, there is no point to talk about it. Mateusz, listen, just a moment, there is a lot to do, you see. We waited for you, the committee is in session, we must, you know, elect new board, wait a moment, let me finish. You'll certainly get elected, you're a man - who means something, you see. - OK, OK, I'm leaving. Look, it's closed, take the key, you'll lock it all up, and I'm leaving, I must find her. Mateusz, are you crazy!?! In such a moment? So what? Did he find her? Actually, I don't know. He never came back again so it's hard to tell. But back to our story, the three huge machines you see there, the yellow ones, are stackers. There are only two more like this in Port Północny. Please, tell me... Tell me, isn't what you said about his wife... Wasn't it too harsh? You know, it might have been. What else can you tell me about Birkut's marriage? Why are you so nervous? Nerves are no good for your beauty, my dear. Yes, but what was it like, actually? You know, just between us, I've never told this to anyone, but frankly speaking, she was never his wife. How could she? I saw the newsreel. Well, there was the newsreel, you know. The wedding also seems to have taken place but... - So? - Should I tell you the truth? It happened so: we went, people from you, the movies, were there, as you call it, the crew. We went to the office in the village called Mogiła. We go there and the official, an old stickler, a hard nut to crack. He says to Hanka: your ID, please. And Hanka was just 16. She says: I don't have it. So he says: maybe papers from the court ofjustice. None whatsoever. And he just dug his heels in. He says: no papers, no wedding. You see. Such a legalist. Maybe we could use such people here in our steelworks now but the times were different then. Well, what to do, my dear. We can't force him to marry them, can we? So we try to haggle, it turns into a huge row. A thousand people are waiting, trucks, vodka, everything ready. It's not easy, what to do? And then, you know, Jodła, our secretary, had an idea. He says to the official: you keep your mouth shut, or you'll come to grief. And he says to us: comrades, I call upon you to keep it in secret. Director! Warsaw on the line. The ministry! Warsaw! Birkut had too many things on his mind to ever deal with it and so it was. You don't happen to have Birkut's address? I need his address. How shall I put it? I looked for him, you see, but so many years, so many duties, later on I moved to Katowice. I am afraid I have to dash. Goodbye. Ah, this is my deputy, Mr. Moniak. - And these are our film-makers. - Moniak. We have artists here basically on every second day. - But it's nice to meet you. - Miss Agnieszka, in the evening you're mine. Maybe I can come up with something more. See you! We call this part of the furnace "pants". When the furnace puts on its pants, it means it will be starting soon. We're all here from the old guard, from Nowa Huta. Well, everybody knew him, everybody was his friend and nobody knows where Birkut is? Maybe you know Birkut's address? I don't. But when I was in Zakopane, I saw Hanka Tomczyk. Naturally, later she was Hanka Birkut. Not really, as there was no wedding from what I heard, am I right? How do you know about it? Well, I went to Zakopane some more times, but I never saw her again. I don't think she lives there anymore. We didn't talk. I don't know. Thank you. Stars of a Season. The season ends quite pleasantly for some. Closer, closer. You're from the movies, aren't you? Please, it's here. You called me, didn't you? Nice to meet you, please, come inside, Come in, please... Please, excuse that I made you wipe your shoes but we've just had the floor painted. We have here such a modest home. Come in, please, sit down. - Well, I have to say... - Gladly, we drove all night from Warsaw. It's a pity there are no radishes. I'm just wondering how you found me, actually I am... Do you really want to talk to me? Yes, to you. I've been looking for you for a long time. I'm ready. Actually, I don't quite understand, I have given up sport for such a long time, you see. It's been so many years, ever since I moved to Zakopane, I only ski but it's just a hobby. It's all right, we're making a movie about Mr. Mateusz. Who? Mateusz Birkut, the hero of socialist labour. He was your first husband, I believe. These gentlemen will prepare the camera and we'll have a little chat, shall we? No. We won't, madam. We shall most certainly not talk about it. And what were you thinking? What did you think I'd say? What did you think I would say? You don't understand me. I'm also a woman. I am only interested in facts. I know it's painful for you. I'm only after the facts. The visit of Mr. Mateusz in Zakopane. How was it? How was he dressed? What did he look like? Just this much. I have a huge chunk of his life on tape. Others also found it hard to talk but they did. You all owe him this much. He was horribly stubborn. He was horribly stubborn and he found me. I though he never would. And he just came. - May I? - You're welcome. You're on holidays? No. - Just passing by. - Passing by. Do you plan to stay in Zakopane for long? No, no. Your tea. - Bill, please. - Just a moment. Director, I need bread. - No, two, excuse me, two. - Here you are. - Dear daughter. - What is it? We have a new customer, you haven't taken his order. I'll do it right away. It doesn't make any sense. What do you want? Tea. - With lemon? - No. Have you got cake with plums by any chance? We don't serve desserts. What will it be? Just tea. Coming right up. What is it to be? Nothing? Tea. - Director. - Chwileczkę, maybe some cheese and fish spread? - Cheese and fish? - Yes. - Director, please. - Just a moment! - Sardines maybe? - Director, it's important. - Please. - No, I don't have sardines. - What would say to a sprat? - Sprat? - Director. - Yes. Just a moment. - Sprat is OK. - Yes, please. - Director, I... - I have to leave. - Are you feeling unwell? - No, no, but... - What is it? - I must leave. But, my dear daughter, in an hour, when there are less people here. - In an hour it'll be too late. - Who is it? Nobody. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I can stay. - OK. You're not taking this tea? It's getting cold. - Sit down. - I can't, I have to work. All right, I'll wait. - So what about the cake? - You just have to know everything. There is really nothing to talk about now. - It was supposed to be without lemon. - Shall I take it back? No, I'm not that particular. When you have a spare moment, sit down, please. Well, this is more or less as I imagined it. Well, don't get angry, I only wanted to... You had to talk later on. Yes, you must have talked, he wouldn't... OK. What did he say? No, no. I beg of you, please, tell me. Oh, you should have said it right from the beginning. Please, sit down, please. No problem, have something to eat. If you excuse me, you don't look as if you were overeating recently. Come on, please. It's all for you. What will you drink? Johnny Walker or Courvoisier? I don't know. I don't know either. So you'll get to know them. Oh, my dear sir. Here you are. So... You are just like myself, it seems. More ready to smell than to drink. - Heart, kidneys, liver? - A bit of everything. Well. - Do you smoke? - No, thank you. - I gave it up. - It's better for your health. - What do you intend to do now? - It depends. - On what? - On various things. - Do you want to lay bricks again? - I would. - But I can't - the hands. - Ah, you see. So? I'll find something. There is more to do at a construction site. - It's not like everyone has to lay bricks. - Well, at the construction sites... - You still talk about the same thing. - And what else? Stay here. No, no, not here. We'll leave. If you do, you do. It's easy to leave but she makes here thrice as much as the best bricklayer. - We'll manage somehow. - Somehow. Please, listen to me. Before October I used to be a great director. The head of the Workers' Holiday Fund. I had pants like you now. Naturally, one can live this way. But what for? Dear sir. You see, you have a biography, I have the capital. You have an impressive biography, a membership card, name - everything that is needed. And the four years. Join me in a company. But what would I do? Sandwiches with cheese spread? No sandwiches, no cheese spread. You will be going to the offices, dear sir, and arrange whatever is necessary. - How do you like it? - In two years you'll have a car. You're welcome. And in four year - a house. And she will spend her time in the Kmicic gossiping with actresses. Think about it, please. You were a sculpture. You still are the sculpture. But it doesn't make any sense. Others have given up long ago. Do you want to be the last? Well! I'll leave you two alone. Think about it and good night. Good night. Leave with me. No. Why? You really are a sculpture and I am a slut. If we leave together it'll be like this forever. So what do you want me to do? I don't know. Do what you want. Mrs. Hania, please, lie down. Don't leave, please. What are you doing? Are you mad, get lost right now. Listen to me. Excuse us for everything. Thank you so much. It's a great pity. You're leaving already? I was in such a hurry, really. You know, business. So how did it all go? All right? As I can see, you haven't changed your taste: Johnny Walker, Courvoisier. - Yes, how do you know? - Film-makers are monsters, they know everything. And you as usual, right? Shit, you're drunk again. What is going on with you today? Are you making this movie in America? You can see the situation. Everything is OK. Hania, I'm so terribly sorry, can you give me his address? - Whose address? - Your son's. Leave Maciek alone. He is not afraid of labour, oh not, SP, hey, SP! Because there is where he sees his future SP, hey, SP! - Horrible. - What? - This architecture. - Ah, what architecture? From the 1950s. Do you like it? I grew up in Muranów. Well, that would explain it. The streets are wider, there are more plants, people are simpler somehow. I can remember as we used to go to Kraków. In wellingtons and work jackets. - Just like this one. - Cool, Mr. Jodła. Kraków and Nowa Huta are examples of completely different urban orders. Different architecture, different city. Mr. Jodła, please, tell me what you think about it. If it was up to me, if I had the authority, I would only leave the Old Market Square and the Cloth Market in Kraków, as souvenirs, everywhere else I would order new, nice blocks of flats. Madam, in Nowa Huta one walks differently, One rides trams differently. In Kraków there is a stop every few meters. People jostle each other, the sidewalks are so narrow. Mr. Jodła, please, tell me if you'd like to see a movie - about Mr. Birkut? - About Mateusz? Yes, I'm making a movie about Mateusz Birkut. What does he do now? And do you think I wouldn't also be - in Warsaw now, if... - No, you misunderstood me. - I'm making a movie about those days. - What "those days"? Well, when you were building Nowa Huta together. Are you looking for sensations? Do you think that the idea of heroes of socialist labour was wrong? No, no, Mr. Jodła. I just... Why should I talk any more? Can you see this city? It didn't appear by itself, did it? We're in Nowa Huta. It's June 18th 1976. Let's get going. Thank you. Is this all? As far as film materials are concerned it is. But we have some very good - sound recordings. - Really very interesting. Worth listening to. - Where is the director? - Just as you asked, she's waiting in the corridor. Thank you so much. No, no, there is no material there. - This is just unconvincing. - No, it's largely exaggerated. There is no way to - edit this thing. - We'll do all we can. We'll edit it, it'll all be as it should. You know but from the point of view of ideology it isn't convincing. You can't do it this way. Have a bit of patience. Anyway, we have to take the risk, it's a debut. - That's obvious. - No, it's not enough for a debut. Put your trust in me. It's going to be great, I'm quite certain. I'm sure that we really need it. What was that about some recordings? Is this the radio? Mr. Leonard? - And what was I to do? - I begged, I warned, keep an eye on her, - it's a debut. - Please, don't scream here. I've been working here for several years, I don'tjust edit, I also think. You all think, just not the way you should. What is it about? She really is a very talented girl. And the material is very good. - I know something about it. - Very good! Very good! Very good! - I have seen your materials. - And? - Interesting. - Is that all? Enough. How are you going to make a movie out of it? - Where is Birkut? - I didn't have enough time. - You haven't found him? - Not yet. You know, about Birkut without Birkut - it doesn't make sense, and where is the son? - You haven't found the son either? - Don't worry. I'll find both. I'll make a great movie. Let me be honest, you have already exceeded all the existing limits. We do support the young, but I am not a representative of a charitable institution. There is no movie so far. As of today you will not get either the film or the camera. You must be mad. So how am I to make the movie? You'll edit, I don't know, two short reports for the magazine or TV News. What?! What are you talking about? You have never seen better material in your entire life. I staked everything on one card, this movie. And it's very well so, but I did not. I have two TV programmes daily. Seven days a week. I can't allow my customer, my client, my viewer to start disregarding me. And do they respect you now? Two weeks for editing. Hey, you, listen - I must make this movie, and you have to let me do it, do you understand? And what am I doing all the time? I gave you materials, equipment, money. Who's paying for what you're doing? The society, and I am responsible for the money. But you have to... sir, come to some agreement with me. You're welcome. Please, leave the materials in the office, return the camera, We don't need you anymore. - They took the movie away from me. - Jesus and Mary, why? I won't get the camera and the film anymore. Oh, and I have just prepared for you this material, they're setting it up. Let's see it, shall we? I missed it earlier on, it was erroneously described in the catalogue. Colleagues reminded me of it. And it has never been used. Gentlemen, the small roll, OK? And suddenly there sounds a song which was never sung during rallies. For he's a Jolly Good Fellow! Interview with Mateusz Birkut. Recording - start. Mr. Mateusz, we're from the Polish Newsreels. Would you like to say a few words to our viewers? Are you making a circus again? Nothing of the sort, we're just working, like you and everybody else. - Go on. - As you know, your native village went in the recent past through a number of unpleasant events. Errors and perversions took an especially rough form. I know. Naturally, the errors were corrected but the trauma remains. As you know, the village agreed to take part in the elections on the condition that you would cast the vote first. I know, this is why I am here. Although I think it's a lunacy. Where are the comrades from the election committee? Neighbours, you came up with a foolish idea. But let it be. - I'm here. - Mateusz, so many bad things happened to you. Will you vote? - And what do you think? - We're waiting. People, there were bad times and good times here. But it is our country. Assume your places, comrades. Maciek. We were looking for young Birkut when we should have been looking for Tomczyk. Gentlemen, please, send these materials to my editing room. Excuse us but we received orders not to release this material. It is supposed to stay here. Maybe you just fucked up the movie, didn't you? Didn't you? How can you fuck up something that is not finished? Or maybe you lied a little? Well, you at the movies... - I didn't lie, dad. - Maybe it was boring? And honest? - Honest. - So they have to release it. - They won't. - Why? Well, why? Why? They just don't want this movie. What do you mean: they don't? They let you do it and they don't want it? They did and now they took it away. They did. They threw away the money and now they don't want it? - They didn't know what the money was for. - I don't get it. What do you mean? They give the money and they don't know what it is for? Strange people. They got frightened. - Frightened? Of what? - Of everything. Nobody is afraid of everything. If one is afraid, it is always just one thing. - What is it? - I don't know. - So find out. - How? Well... Find that Birkut. But I've already told you, they took everything: camera, films. And you just can't find him without the camera? What for? If somebody was making a movie about me, I would be greatly surprised if he wouldn't visit me. Anyway, I would be a little surprised. So what now? Are you going to stay like this for the rest of your life? - At some point I'll get up. - OK, OK. Take your bag and shoes. What for? I've already told you. If somebody was making a movie about me... Come on, look for him. Talk to him. And then you'll come back and tell. - You? - Well, maybe me. Why not? Must everything be always done for everyone? I am for that matter greatly curious to know how it all ended up. Move on. You have a bus in half an hour. I prepared some cherry liqueur. When you come, it'll be just ready. - We'll share a glass. - I don't drink. Home-made cherry liqueur? - Unless it's cherry liqueur. - You see. - Tadek is still in the army? - What do you mean: still? - He's just been sworn in. - Did you go? Certainly I did. It was very nice. Tadek has grown to be quite a man. I went to mother's grave. You planted very nice flowers there. - I also like to go there. - Are you getting married? What for? I am the only woman who can talk to you about it. And it is very well so. Look after yourself, bye. Just a moment. Here for you, buy some nice clothes, in these rags you'll never find a decent boyfriend. - Thanks. - Well, bye for now. Bye. Let me kiss you. Take care, bye. - Excuse me, Mr. Tomczyk? - Yes, it's me. What is it? You are Mateusz Birkut's son. I am and what is it about? - I'm looking for your father. - My father? - I made a movie about your father. - You did? Anyway, it's not important. I just would like to see him. I feel I must talk to him. What are you after, actually? I just need your father's address. My father is dead. Excuse me. Goodbye. I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.
