Dezs? Kosztol?nyi: SKYLARK Directed by: L?szl? Ran?dy Good afternoon! Is anybody here? Who's there? Who let you in? Good afternoon! You ordered me to come, sir. Mother, the gate was open. I'll close it. Come! Wait here on the porchway. Mother! - Mother! - What? - Where is she? - Out there in the trellis, saying goodbye. She left her seersucker dress here. She only wears what is on her, anyway. Yes, but the toothbrush and the glass is also here. - I'd put it in her suitcase. - No, no! She knows better where to put them, you know. Leave it. Leave it, of course. Shouldn't we go? Maybe we should go. Skylark! Come, my little daughter! He came to take the luggage. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You can take a new one every day. There is enough. And don't make the bed every day. Lifting makes you the worst. Just arrange the pillows in the morning and leave it that way. And then when I'm home, we'll make the bed properly. Father's medicine is here in the drawer, so as the camomile tea. I've filled the night-lamp with oil, it will last. Don't look for the oilholder, I've sanitized it with lye. Please don't make the tea too strong, it could be bad for Father's heart. I've cancelled the milkman for the week. And please, Mother, do not bother with cooking! My dear mother, you think I don't know how the food at the restaurant is? I know it well. But for these couple of days you shouldn't tire yourself. Make sure to eat a little hot soup and something roasted. When I'm back I'll treat your stomach. I'll cook you soups with caraway seeds and spare fricassee. And noodles with semolina. I'm not traveling. You don't want to go? I can't leave you. You'll be so alone. But Uncle Bela and the others are expecting you. And traveling to a new place would... ...do you good. But you'll be so alone. You will be abandoned. I would be devastated. We have a lot to do. We have to do the laundry next week. I'll prepare everything. Who did the laundry while you were a little girl? We'll be just fine. Right, Father? Sure. My lord, Mother! If she doesn't want to, then she doesn't want to. We can't do this to Bela. They're expecting her. - And the landowner. - Sure, the landowner. You told me, she might be lucky. Of course I told you. But maybe... We should wait. Maybe next week. My little birdie doesn't want its keeper to go away, right? On whose shoulder will you fly on while I'm away? What can we do if she wants to stay? Mother, I'll tell her. We can go. My dear parents will take care of you, my birdie. They will give you wheat and fresh water. They will keep you well, you'll see. No! - The door can not be closed. - It'll fly away, I'm afraid. It won't. It is used to the cage and likes it. Yes. Used to it and likes it. Won't fly away. You should put this separately next to your luggage. Be careful not to squeeze it! Bela loves quince jelly very much. Father, hurry, we'll be late! Aunt Ida! - Don't stop! - We'll be late. We can't offend her. Skylark! Skylark! Skylark, my dear, are you traveling? You look so good! Well, it's really hard to leave my dear parents. Be careful, you don't want the goose to go under your skirt! Have a safe journey, farewell! Geza Cifra has been promoted to a traffic manager. Have you been to the litany? I've been packed my things all afternoon. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Farewell! Have a safe journey! Farewell. Take care, Skylark! Goodbye! Have a safe journey! Be back to the Nativity of Mary! Take my arm! Hey, come on, Mr Cifra! Is this allowed? To be honest, this makes me sad. Really sad. That a train officer who is a gentleman after all, escapes from his bride without taking the luggage at least... Excuse me but I have something... I have to ask you to stay calm, otherwise you might make me angry which is not recommended. Tell me, Mr Cifra, are you even suitable for duelling? I've applied to the casino, but... What do I hear? Casino? Please note that, sir, that you have to be a real gentleman for that. You can't compromise widely known to be moderate, domesticated maidens. - Please... - Going over for months, eating their food and then just never go back? When was this? Come on! For a girl who's been waiting for a husband for 10 years this doesn't matter. What would you say if I'd go there to make peace? Mr Fuzess, this will go unpleasantly. I have official arrangements to do. Listen to me, old fellow, now you're doing me a favour. A lady is getting off the first class cabin. You go there, salute and ask her to get on the third cab. You understand? The third one. Come on! A gentleman stays quiet. Attention! Train leaving from platform three. Kiss die hand! Lieutenant Fuzess sent me. May I? Father! At your service! Skylark! Skylark! May I? Come here, daughter! This will be a good place for you! - Is this good here? - Yes. - Praised be Jesus Christ now... - ...and forever. Amen. Farewell, my little daughter! Take care, please take care! We'll be waving goodbye with you mother. Skylark - Is your place good? - Very good. I hope you won't catch a cold in this infernal heat! There is water in the flask, don't drink cold water! Mother, don't eat canteloupe or cucumber salad, those might be bad for your stomach! - Goodbye, my little daughter! - Farewell! Farewell! I almost forgot. - Farewell, my little daughter! Take care! - Farewell! I'll be home on Wednesday. A week from now. Take care! We had a good cry again, Mother. Come! Did she go away? Yes. Recently we got a new trainline, you know. And now I am at service all day all night. Ahh, these youngsters! You can't appreciate yet... ...but beauty isn't everything, don't forget this. One day you'll... I should've told him that he'll appreciate domesticated girls. I think you told him that. Really? I don't remember. You said you can't appreciate domestic girls. No. I'm sure I didn't add domestic. I should have. You'll appreciate domesticated girls! Bastard! Well, you shouldn't have said that. No Mother, no. I had to say this. You're right. You did. The air is so stuffy here. What was that? I think it came from the bedroom. It's just the pigeon. Oh my god, how... ... empty this house is. Yes. We are alone. I don't even know how we'll make it without her. I'll make some dinner. Just some camomile tea, please. - Do you know her? - No. Order something! Mother! The Panthers. Papa Feher. Oh, the arguments we had! Ripoczay the pharmacist. Oh, and Szunyog, the Latin teacher. Always drunk! He's been doing it for 30 years now. We had some great skulls. Back then they failed to understand that only Deak can readjust the country. Actually this is the reason I stopped meeting them. Yes, this is the reason. Father, you order! Let's see! Well, please bring some soup make it really hot at least. Excuse me... Aren't you archivist Vajkay? Yes I am. Don't you recognize me? I recognized you immediately. I am Guszti. Guszti! 15 years ago I was the headwaiter here. - Guszti. - Ahh, Guszti? Mother, Guszti! Can I please kiss the hands of the lady? Good afternoon, Guszti! Thank you very much. I'm really happy. Oh, really happy! And your daughter? If you'll allow me, I thought you moved to another town. I am not an archivist anymore, Guszti. I am retired now. If you'll excuse me, archivist Vajkay stays archivist Vajkay forever. Please, let's talk about something else. I haven't forgotten anything, I still know everything. So, really hot goulash with a lot of noodles and a lot of fat. - Look, Guszti! - Guszti remembers very well, but my husband can't eat these kind of dishes. And what about roast with onions? What are you try to tempt my patients to? - Doctor! - Good afternoon. Careful, I know this old bastard. Clear soup, roasted chicken, stewed fruit, bread pudding. Ohm... Excuse me for a minute, please! Miklos! How did you like it? How is it? - Hello, Geza. - Hello. Well, to be honest, it is not good. I mean, it might be good, but I don't like it. Yes... Well, I understand your situation, but... after all I haven't written that much editorias. But I believe that I made myself clear regarding the political situation, pointing out the good and bad sides of these concept. You know, this isn't about that. You should have paid more attention to the correct spelling. Still, this is what makes people trust you. Excuse me! - This is an overstatement! - It's not. I marked them with red. Read it! - Listen to me... - I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not an offense at all. So its unnecessary to think about provocation. - Enjoy your meal! - Thank you very much. - How is it? - Passable... Actually quite... Quite passable. Balint! Balint Kornyei is here. - We used to be good friends for along time. - I know Balint, too. Father, he courted me. Really? Oh right. Howdy, old chap! - Hello! - Hello, hello. - Who are these people? - The Vajkays. Retired county archivist. The one with that daughter. You're telling me? I was at the station yesterday, and I saw her saying goodbye to his parents. There was this Cifra. - Yes, the traffic manager. - What a scene it was! Welcome, my dear Akos! Kiss die Hand! This is a turn up for the books. - What brings you here? - We came for lunch. Excuse us for not greeting you, we didn't look around at all. You wicked old Panther, why don't you ever visit us in the casino? I know, I know. If that's what you need, I can solemnly say, you were right. We are all humans. I don't argue. I'm tired. You were right, the world proved it. But hey, the landowner was asking about you, he asked where did our scholar ?kos Vajkay go. He asked, for sure. Forgive me, but I no longer drink, nor smoke, nor play cards. And of course, what is more, I've grown old. What do you mean you've grown old? We are the same age. I don't know, my dear Balint, it just happened. There are some, who do. And you, dear Toni? God, how young you are! Do you remember that night's music? I beg your pardon, dear Akos, when was it exactly? Sixty...No. It was on Pentecost, I know that. No! On the Nativity of Mary. Greetings. Good bye, dear Akos. See you soon. See you soon for real! And don't forget, men's night is always on Tuesday. - Waiter! - Yes, please? - Two bread puddings, please! - Yes, right away. Look Mother! The cross leans the wrong direction on the crown. Usually it's the right. It's misprinted. Look Father, what a fancy bag. Nice hats. They are nice. Too modern. - Father, read me the paper today, will you? - I will. My lady. Hello my dear Akos. - Dear Miklos, Good day! - Greetings dear Miklos! What are you doing here? I am studying the human heart. It's obvious you are a poet. Always the sentimental things... Terrible. It's wrong to put human genitals on display. Why? from a medical view it's undeniable, that humans got a brain, stomach, liver... Skylark never let us stop here. I think, she is right. But what is wrong with this? Of course from a medical view humans got a - brain, stomach, liver, heart... - Believe me, this has to be known. Calm down, Miklos, something bothers you. Did you read my poem in the Sunday paper? We couldn't. I wrote that we should love life stripped naked, but we don't dare to, because it often hurts. I've read a few of your articles. I can say, you pen strongly. I don't know if it's right in our calm world. Calm world? Hypocrite world! Life is not pretty. It's as raw as we saw there. We need to face it realistically. But we don't dare. Then how do we squeeze out that little happiness it can give? I know you are a good boy, Miklos. When you were young, you sat on my lap. - Excuse me, my Uncle Akos! - Just go dear Miklos, go! - Beautiful couple. - Actress. Hey, Father, we never invited this boy. He is very young. I didn't mean that. Just in general. Why then? Mother! You know, we could have eaten homemade puff pastry? Homemade? What do you mean homemade? It's written here. Homemade puff pastry. How could it be homemade? I don't know. Homemade puff pastry. Father, you told me you will read me the paper today. Soon...Hey Mother, have you tried pike in white wine? I did not, and I don't want to. That must be a food of the sots. Skylark's cooking is good enough for us. Of course! It's just more for the fun of it. Such nonsense! Pike in white wine! And roasted oxen! It must be horribly full of fat. It must be. And rabbit saddle. - And pilaf. - We eat pilaf too, though. - Yes, we do, but theirs maybe... - Father! Do you seriously trust this? In this landowner case. Why wouldn't I? Mother, you have to listen to this one. Walnut of cream calf. Father, we should talk. You know what about. Yes, yes... Silver-side of calf with apple gravy. Overcooked fried lamb. Frit... What's this? Fritto misto? Fritto misto, what could that be? I'll bring the dictionary. - Fritto misto... - You have to face the facts, Father. The landowner is a widow, he has two children. Maybe you will be right. But what will happen to us if you won't? Yes. We really need to talk about this. Fritto, Fritto... Mother, I can't see. Maybe you should screw the bulbs in. - How cosy! - Right? Now you can read. Here it is: fritto misto. Fish, marrow, fried cauli. - Cauli? It's cauliflower. - Of course, it's cauliflower. Let's see, what else! - Bread pudding. - We ate that today. Mother, there is also kettle goulash. Kettle goulash. With a lot of fat. You can't even imagine how happy I am for you. We are bored of each other with Rimoczay. What are you drinking? You hear, director? They yet to see the ''Geisha''. We don't go to the theatre much. My daughter can't stand the smell of the theatre. It gives her a headache. But the doctor and the manager of the bank too both tell that it was a great success. Little Margit Lator is like a real subrette in it. Fascinating. Delightful! This Margit Lator is the one who goes on walks with Miklos Ijas, right? Yes, yes. And this Morvai boy. What did he do? In full military decoration, helmet on head, sword on side he walked in the sauna. And he stepped in the hot water pool. Of course we cheered for him. And what did he do then? He draw his sword, saluted, and dead drunk marched out of the pool to the streets. He was steaming like a train. Feri Fuzess even captured it. You can wait for me letting my husband in the casino with you. You can let him, Tonika. And I'll sneak back to court you. Father, I hate him so much. - Who? - Feri Fuzess. - Why? - At one club ball he was nasty with Skylark. I don't remember. - At your service! - Hello! Greetings! My dear uncle! I'm happy for you. Last time I asked Balint why didn't invite you over to this table. Madam, please let me congratulate on your taste! - And this little lace! - Oh, such an old dress. I've had this for... I don't even dare to say, how old it is. No, no. There are some, on whom an old dress looks like it's from the newest Paris collection. - Hello gentlemen! - Hello! How kind! There, you see! I am sorry for being late, but I had an urgent appointment. - On a Sunday? - Well, well! Everything has it's side of light and shadow. You are a ribald! And a nitwit. ''Everything has it's side of light and shadow.' ' What a nitwit! - Excuse me... - Hey, hey! From a teacher this is not a fulmination, nor an abuse! What then? Unsatisfying circulation, low pulse, puffy skin, ice cold hands. You know, what's next. Don't you drink something, old chap? Well, I haven't had a drink of alcohol in 15 years now. It goes well with wine. It makes you drink one. Then a little beer, maybe. That has the least alcohol in it. Son, a beer please! The tiniest glass. - Yes. - You really don't drink? No, 15 years now. I drink. Eat! Some people eat. I drink. Do you think everyone should do the same? You are wrong. Everyone has a reason to do it. And everyone knows their reasons. You think that Judge Doba doesn't know his? His wife cheats on him all the time. He gives keys to his lovers. So, the keys of Mrs Doba. Enough of a reason to drink. Or you, for example. Me? What do you mean? All of my students became her lover, while I am still not. I, who love her for eight years now, am not. ''Amabo mea dulcis ipsitilla...'' - Is that his husband? - Yes. Judge Doba. He knows Latin, too. He is also a dead man. - So? - He never says a word. He had the time to get used to it. Nobody has ever courted her wife in Latin at least. Father! Father, tomorrow we're going to the theatre! Mother, come, help, otherwise we're staying home. Oh, Father, Father, Father! What are you talking about? - Come here! - Here. I always buttoned it for my poor father. Father, do you remember when we went to the theatre in Pest for the first time? We got engaged that day. Oh god, it was a long time ago! Thirty years ago. You were so beautiful! And you are still like that. I'm not beautiful anymore. I used to be, once... You will be again. - Now? - Yes, now, everything will be fine. And we'll have this jezebel life? King of Hungary restaurant and theatre? And you'll be behaving like a sot? - Yes, I will. - Shame on you! Father! Father, look what I got! Oh, how beautiful! Where did you get it? At Weiss and Company. How do you like it? Really nice. Isn't it too modern? No. Oh, my curling iron! Who is this? Father, please get my opera-glasses out of the drawer! '' My dear good parents!'' ''I have arrived. Uncle Bela was waiting for me at the station. " ''Poor Uncle Bela has changed a lot.'' ''His hair is grey, at first it was hard to get used to it.'' ''I just looked at him and smiled.'' ''He did the same.'' ''Did I grow old? He asked.'' ''No, I told him. Of course not.'' ''Then Aunt Etelka started to laugh.'' ''We have great company here.'' ''Guests from Budapest. The Turzo-girls or what.'' ''They are really noisy.'' ''They asked me to let them take their luggage to my room.'' ''I gladly let them do it.'' ''Since I prefer to be alone,'' ''I offered them to stay in my room.'' ''I live in a cosy little room now.'' ''I couldn't like these girls.'' ''Zelma, the older one is so Art Nouveau.'' ''She's smoking and she's not wearing a corset.'' ''She laughs at me because I always bring a fresh bouquet of flowers home.'' ''The landowner showed me where to find the most flowers.'' ''I even have a little admirer.'' ''The youngest child of the landowner.'' ''This widower raises his children all alone.'' ''Unfortunately not very well, those children are kind of madcaps.'' ''The youngest one even made me uncomfortable once.'' 'It looked like in the first days that she really likes me.'' ''And then she called me mother in front of everyone.'' ''Everybody laughed.' ''I blushed, of course.'' ''And then these countrychildren stopped coming over.'' ''Surely they got offended by the laughing.'' ''Now I do nothing all day.'' ''Still I am really tired at the end of the day.'' ''I am so alone.'' ''And then the children stopped to come over.'' ''Offended by the laughing...'' ''Now I do nothing all day...'' ''Once she called me mother..'' Say hello to her! Good afternoon! - Who is this? - Mother. Mother? Come my little butterfly, sit here, in my lap! You said mother? Am I the mother? Darling little star, come, give me a peck! What should I give you? Do you want this necklace? Look at it, how beautiful! It's yours now, okay? Darling little star you called me mother? Hey! What did you get? A necklace from mother. This is not our mother. She was more beautiful. - No. - Yes. Excuse me, miss, please don't fool the children! Come, my girl! ''And then the children stopped to come over. They were offended by the laughing.'' ''Now I do nothing all day.'' ''I'm still dead tired by the night.'' I'm so alone... Father, did you find the opera-glasses? Oh, Father, I'm so excited! How many acts will be? Have you checked the posters? Why don't you answer me? Something wrong, Father? - No, everything's fine. - Let's go then! We'll be late. If the court can't deal with it, we'll go to the hall. Thank you for your kindness. I was asking about you. I asked Balint Kornyei what happened to our kind, scholar Vajkay? Yes, Balint mentioned it. Thank you for asking. We'll meet later at the casino then. We'll exchange our ideas, just like old friends do. Pardon. These Pribuczai girls are so kind. Kamilla dresses them so nicely. What is that, Father? Aren't you happy? Of course, darling? I'm really happy. Why wouldn't I be? Oh, I feel so good here! Hurry, it starts soon! Funny. Mrs Ujlaki got the primadonna's dress from Blue Lady. - A wonderful play, have you seen it? - We rarely go to the theatre. My daughter doesn't like the smell of it. We are here today just by chance, thanks to Mr Aracsy. My husband and I just discussed today, that... Gold stone in red pane, right? That is the Doba family... Yes, that is out coat of arms. I used to research the genealogy of the Doba family. Are you a scholar, Mr Vajkay? I was just looking at some documents in Latin as an archivist, but I am not a scholar. Mother, Mr Doba has an ancestor who was a cup-bearer at court. He was the primus aquirens of the Doba family, cup-bearer of king Bela IV. I'm really very happy. Primus... What did you say? Primus aquirens. The ancestor who made the family fortune. And the Doba family had one? And where is the fortune they made? Old noble titles, well, they came with a donated property. Because they had the attribute of... And why are you interested in these Latin letters? As I have mentioned earlier, I was an archivist. And I also liked it. It's really good for you, dear, you go out a lot. It's a much more pleasant form of entertainment. Entertainment? I'm not sure. Something has to happen. I'm so alone. Yes, I'm so alone. Japan. Japan. This is unbelievable! I've introduced them. My dear Miklos, it's really good to meet you! I just wanted to let you know that after all I'm not angry because of that incident. You know, I don't want to leave in anger. You know that I'm leaving? Sure. My little spies are everywhere. I also got to know that you got a monthly contract at the Pest Gazette, right? Even that you could get a job for Miss Lator somewhere. You did everything so clever! Obviously, you got bored of this onehorse town, right? We're leaving on Saturday. Sarszeg is not for me. You know what, my little editor? Seriously, I almost envy you. I wanted to ask you. This Margit... How will you meet? She'll follow you to Pest? No. We're going together. Really? Ah. Why is this so unbelievable? Just because I heard... Maybe it's not true. So, I heard that Margit is traveling to Opatija with Papa Feher. What? Maybe she'll be back by Saturday. You're lying! Take away your hand. Mr editor. Bela Herenyi! Have you seen Bela Herenyi? - Who's there? - It's me. I'm not ready yet, Miklos. Open it, otherwise I break the door! Is it true? Tell me it's not true! Terez, leave. Tell me it's not true! But it is. I want to live while I'm young. You could come with me. I have a contract. You could've had one, too. I was only promised. Here I am loved. I am the town's favourite. You know what they wrote about me. No. I don't have the strength to start from the beginning. I'm afraid. - Miss, onto the stage! - I'm coming. At least tell me you don't love me. That would make it easier. I can't say that. Did you tell him that you love me? I did. When you come back you still want to love me? Yes. Yes. How mean you are! Maybe. But you should go, okay? Please, I'm asking you to leave! Go away, can't you hear me? Go! - No. - It's me, little girl. Still, no. My god, so beautiful! How beautiful feelings! Mother, did you feed the pigeon? I've told you several times not to disturb me before my big scene! I hope you'll remember next time. - I hope I'll have the luck soon. - Good night. Are we going by the carriage? Yes. I have to come back to the casino and I don't want to stay late. I would've walked. I would've walk you home. Father, you told me that we'll talk after the theatre. Yes. Have you seen it? - Yes. - The little Margit Lator. It's unbelievable. She chuckles around on stage so innocently. Nothing hurts to these people. I'll hurry back. Father... You are so strange. Why? They invited me, I have to go. - But if you don't feel like it! - I don't feel like it? Why wouldn't I feel like not to go? I'm in a very good mood. Calm down! It's okay. Everything's going to be all right. I'll have a walk. Go to bed! I'll be waiting for you. I'm not sleeping until you get home. Goodbye. Akos, my friend! Hello! Excuse me. Can I walk with you? - Well, I... - I'd like to talk to you. Me? About what? About a lot of things. Can't we sit in somewhere? To talk? Actually I also... Look at these people: Kornyei, Szunyog, Doba. Twisted. Distorted. Their souls are curling inwards. Tell me, my son, do you drink? No. Good. Just moderately! I don't drink either, nor do I smoke. But sometimes you need to. - Well... - Guszti, two Kadars, please! I always wanted to go to America. Where the embezzlers and cheaters go. But I didn't. I stayed. I stayed. I started to write. And now I'm further from everybody than I'd be if I went to America. You don't belong there. You drifted away, too. I've been watching you for a long time. Are you watching me? You never leave home. I live sincerely. I do everything for them. For family. Love. This can't be a solution either. You are also unhappy. I... I don't really think about this. You have to work. Unfortunately I am retired now. But work is very noble, son. Uncle Akos, these are commonplaces. You bohemians are strange. I told my wife this. It's like you were living on an island, where you don't care about the laws of humans. You just make a joke of life. We share our suffers, Uncle Akos. This is why I wanted to talk to you. Pain puts everyone down. We can't do anything about it. Why do you deny it? I still have obligations... The landowner invited me to the casino. - Are you offended? I'm sorry. - This is really important, you should accept it. You also wanted to talk about something. You are too young. In honour of a returned old Panther! A light sylvaner. God bless you, my Akos! Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you. Go on then! Look, my dear Balint, we used to be very good friends. - Maybe we should sit down. - Did you have dinner? Haven't you heard? Two bottles of sulphuric water to the pharmacist's table! Excuse me, but I am the host. Everything has to go smoothly here! Come, I'll get you someone who you can talk to. Look, not just like that... Of course, not just like that. Come, I can see Feri Fuzess. Then maybe we should look for Szunyog. Szunyog? Excellent! It's clear that an old Panther never denies himself! Come. Doba is still waiting for the landowner. Why? Is he not coming? My dear Akos... Come! Gentlemen, I brought a guest. Szunyog, take a converted boy under your wings! Servus humilimus! If I just knew what this old cave dweller's doing here. I'd like to drink to the landowner and to a beautiful woman. Go to hell, hey, we don't get offended! Come, my dear Aos, drink with me! Cheers! Here you go. Tell me, don't you have a little time? I do. Until the morning. I'm free in a minute, but first we need to finish this bottle. Drink then, cheers! - Hello! - Hello! Please, come a little closer! - So? - I'd like to tell you something. Last time at lunch you told me something like that for example here I am. Remember? Maybe. I don't know. It's possible, that for example here you are, but for example here I am also. And Feri Fuzess. And here we are. And since here we are, we can finish this bottle. For example who are not here, they don't drink it. You promised to drink to the beautiful Mrs Doba. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Doctor Gal? - He's always drunk. - Where is Pribuczay? - Playing cards, there. - There is. - There is not. - But there is. - Prove it! You prove that there is not. The only goal of life comes from the perspective of nature. From the perspective of humans there is not. To nature humans are neutral, like the smallest worm out there. There was a time when there were no humans, nor worms. And there will be a time when there are no humans, nor worms. This is what Darwinism teaches. Darwin! Do you have any quarrels with this? It's not like I wouldn't consider him a gentleman, but... ... he also has his own bright and dark sides. Dimwit! What a waste! What an extravagance! To fritter away everything we experience. To spill it on the floor alongside the wine. At the sides of the Seine they erect buildings out of these colours and feelings. Books are written. If the gentlemen told everything, that is in their minds, more books could be written than there is in the casino's library. No one reads those. Well, drink then... Excuse me, please! I think I am the older one. Allow me? Hello. Hello. Excuse me. My dear Akos, where are you going? I went to Pribuczay, he's waiting for you. Hurry, come! - Gentlemen. - My dear Akos! The old gamer is here. Are you playing? Sit down! - Here! Take a seat! - Just sit down! - Sit down, here, take my place. - Thank you. I was looking for you. How long you want to play? Until I run out of money. What do you drink? Waiter, a round, please! Don't bother, I don't drink. Not because of... You get in, my dear Akos, you get in. - Eight. - Wow! Pick up!

Akos, you don't want to leave, right? - But Uncle Akos... - Akos! Leave me alone! Who are you? I don't know you. Can you play the cards? Ich verstehen nicht Ungarisch. - Hello. - Hello. Where is Geza Cifra? Do you know what is here? The heart. - Hertz. - Ah. And the heart is aching. Where is Geza Cifra? I know who you want to talk to. At this time he is always at... Madame Panna. Gentlemen, we go to Madame Panna, just as we are! - Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go to Madame Panna! Akos, let's go to Madame Panna! Great! Come on, follow me! Girls! The gentlemen arrived. Perfume yourselves! Jolika! Joli! Music for the men! Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Wine for the men, five bottles at least, hurry! Tell me, Madame Panna, where is this Cifra, the railway man? The traffic manager? Where would be? Please be kind and tell him that we would like to talk to him. Now? No, he really can't be bothered now. If I want to talk to him then he can be bothered. I've arranged it. He'll be here soon. - Who is coming? - You'll see. But I feel sick. I would like to go home to my wife. I want to talk to my wife. - Where is he? - Who? - Geza Cifra. He is in his wedding bed with his bride. - With his bride? - Of course... You can't imagine how many brides he has. Girls, come! Come! Uncle Akos, let me! I'll introduce you to my bride. Dear miss, if you allow me, Akos Vajkay, retired archivist. I'm Lulu. What do we drink? Would you tell me your surname? She has no such thing. Have you heard it, gentlemen? I introduced Lulu to Uncle Akos as my bride. Then he asked her surname. Then I told him she has no such thing. Good, right? Very good, from a dimwit. - What? - Leave it, . You should get a bottle of wine! All right, bring that wine! Excuse me, Feri, I'd like to talk to you privately. Go on then! - My dear Feri, please sit down. - Here you go. I have just a couple of words to tell you. My dear Feri, you shouldn't marry into a family like that. If you allow me, this is just a friendly advice. Nothing more, just a friendly advice. It would be better to... ... marry from a decent house. This is a decent house. A decent brothelhouse. Did you hear what he said? He said that the girls are from a decent house. A decent brothelhouse. - Good? - Dimwit! Here's the wine. Come! I need a girl from a decent house. Listen to me! Cook him well! What is going on with this Cifra? Was he notified? Of course he was. - What's your name? - Akos. Do you feel good, my little Akos? Old fellow! I am so happy to see you happy again! Promise me that this will last forever. I promise! Good! Akos! SiIencium! Here you go, talk to him. I wanted to talk to him? Of course! Mr Cifra we need to talk to you. Unfortunately, to be honest, I should be at service... No service! Step closer, maybe he wants to slap you! Uncle Akos, if you need a duel acquaintance... Are you even suitable for duelling? I... Gentlemen, please let me go! Mr Vajkay, if I happened to offend you, I can assure that... - Offended him?! - Feri! Old fellow, if you don't want to say a thing, then don't. I do. Yes, I want to tell him something. Then say it! So... ... this bride of yours. She isn't my bride. Excuse me, Uncle Akos, I think I don't have to reason you my decisions. Miss, do you want to be the bride of this man? - Well, if I get paid for it. - I pay. Here you go. I don't spare the money. I want you to be happy! Here! Miss, do you want a groom? I buy you... I buy you for Feri Fuzess. Here. Consider yourself engaged! Excuse me! Misses, I buy a groom for all of you! You all get a decent groom! I buy all the grooms! Everybody gets one! A decent, noble groom! Madame Panna, get some more candles! Unsatisfying circulation, low pulse, puffy skin, ice cold hands. Let's sing to him. Akos! Akos! Where did he go? He ran away! - Insubordination - Stop this... Tonika asked me to take care of him! - Over there! - Akos! That is him! Akos! Akos! My dear Akos, so you ran away? Is this the honour of the outlaw? Give me something to drink! - Could you do something to me? - Of course. I'm begging you, please shoot the puppet for me! - The puppet? - The puppet. Don't get bothered. Right into the heart! It's really visible. It's easy to hit. Well, if it has a heart let's shoot that. Leave it! Are you out of your mind? More! More, more more! - Come, old fellow, let's take a look at it! - No. I don't want to. - Why we never thought about this? - Very good! Original. - Wow! - Nice hit! Congratulations! Akos! Akos... Akos! Uncle Akos! For god's sake! Where is he? - Can I take your luggage? - No. Good morning, Miklos! Good morning, Skylark! - Are you going away? - Yes. - For how long? - Forever. Don't go! Home is the best to be. Believe me, home is the best. Mother! Father! For god's sake! What happened to you? I am an ignominious blackguard, a polecat! Oh, you drank a little too much, you had some fun. I'll get a cold pack for your forehead. I'm all right, I don't need it. I'm not even drunk anymore. I'm just... old. I don't care. Don't say this! Father, what are you talking about? Mother, we got a letter from her. I know. You know? I found the envelope. She failed, right? Poor thing! I feel sorry for her. Such an orphan... Such an orphan. I've kn?wn this for ten years now. Mother, we don't love her. - Who? - Us. We wouldn't even care if she died right now. How can you say such things? It's a sin against God! Dear Father! You say we don't love her? Remember that when the accident happened. When she fell from the attic stairs. You were the one to call for the teacher. You ran away at midnight like a lunatic. And how happy you were when the teacher said that he is not necessary anymore. We love her very much. And she loves us very... It is a lie! It's not true. We are lying to each other. To ourselves. We can't love her. She ruined our lives! Why? Because she never got married? You think that nowadays marriage is like paradise? Do you know what happened to Piri Szilkuti? Janka Hernad is beaten by his husband. You want this? We should go out more. To meet people. She stays home because of you, she feels like you are ashamed of her. Out there, among people, Doba, Kornyei, that drunkard Szunyog... Why, is it better with them? Or is it better for them? I'm not different from them. And they are no more happy than me. Their souls are curling inwards. Today someone told me that we are pure people. It's not true! I am an ignominious blackguard, a polecat! And she is ugly. Ugly! Our daughter is ugly. Ugly. Mother, I beg you We can't do this anymore. We must do something. We should live a whole life. Mother, help! Maybe the two of us... Oh, my god, you were so beautiful! We still have some time. Mother! Take my hand! Mother! My girl! - Father? - Father doesn't feel good. He is tired. - I have arrived a day... - Tomorrow you'll tell us everything. - So she is here... - Our little bird arrived.
