-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- - The final container is here? - Yes sir. I examined the contents myself. They're all glocks. - All 45's and nine's? - Yeah. Top quality. That new guy, he heard about what you did to that chump that tried to cheat you. Let's just say he's very accommodating. Even the slightest request. Permission? - Who the hell was that? - He's a driver for my stepdad's friends. - Well he almost ran us off the damn road. - That might be better than what happens if he tells my stepdad. - Is he really that bad? - My dad wasn't the greatest, but it's times like these that make me miss him the most. - Wait, I thought you didn't have to answer to anybody. - I didn't. My dad gave me access to my trust, but my new legal guardian wants to control my life. - Like clockwork. - You think Mikhailov is really involved in criminal activity or just an ambitious Russian building an empire? - Or both. - Did you read the Interpol report? Sure sounds like this is the same man, don't you think? I mean, I've read a lot of reports. - Good morning sir. - The doctor, he has been here, da? - Yes sir. He's upstairs waiting for you. I was just about to take up her morning snack. Would you like to take it? - My sister, she has called? - No sir. - Contact me when she does. - Good morning Mr. Mikhailov. - Tell me anything, doctor. Doesn't seem to be change. - The good news is there's nothing seriously wrong. Her wheezing is just some slight congestion. Repositioning her and adding another pillow will help with that. - And her weight? - That's something that we need to monitor. Unfortunately, brain injury recovery has no rules. - When I play music for her, her eyes move. - Yes. Marie mentioned that. - That's a good sign, no? - Could be recovery, yes, but more than likely is reactors firing off in her brain. Tatiana could stay like this, or she could fall back into a coma. There's a chance she could even recover, but with damage like this, it's impossible to predict right now. - Spaceibo doctor. I appreciate your honesty and privacy. If you should need favor, you come see me. - I appreciate that Mr. Mikhailov, but unnecessary. Just glad to help. - So, I'm having lunch with Olga and Katarina today. Katarina's considering university, politics of all things. Tatiana, please, eat more. Tatiana. Come back to me. - There you go. Here's your water. - Thanks man. Good workout. - You did great. - Thanks. Missed you Jason. Where have you been hiding? - You know me. I was looking for the next big adventure. - Well, when you're looking for something new to explore, you should call me. - You here to hit the weights or on clients? - Showing off again. - Does it work? - On your audience? Yes. - Are you? - I am not in your audience demographic. - What's my demographic? - Apparently, easily impressed. - You know Liz, you can't resist me forever. - You need to add a few extra reps to the left. - No one will hire this guy, Liz. He's a real scumbag. - That's why I'm friends with you. - Well, if Jason is against you, then that's all the more reason that I'd love to hire you. Let's go talk. - I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Can I get you gentlemen anything? - Why don't you come a little closer to let me see you. Come on. - I'm not on the menu. There's some pretty good prime rib tonight. Does that sound good? - I don't like prime rib. - Hey, big boy, you don't wanna get in me trouble with my boss now. - Gentlemen! Can I help you? - No buddy, we're fine. Me and the little lady are just sitting here and getting to know each other. - Can I get you gentlemen any coffee before you hit the road? - Yes ma'am, that would be very kind of you. I'm sorry about the misunderstanding. Me and my buddy here were just trying to have a little fun. - Looks like your pal just stuck you with the check. - Sorry for the misunderstanding. - Andrei, do you have a moment? - You have something to say? - Yes sir. I came to apologize. I meant no harm. I was showing off my friend around the curb too fast. - And this friend, he encourage you to do this? - No. I was trying to scare him. - Perhaps you should choose your friends more careful if they encourage you to be thoughtless. Do not associate with strays outside of Opulent. - We need to make some changes. Apparently, you have too much free time on your hands and you're getting in trouble. You stop embarrassing this family. I think it's time you got a job. - I don't need a job. I have a trust fund. - You don't start showing some responsibility and respect to this family, you won't have a job and you won't have a trust fund, or a car. - Hey, bourbon on the rocks for my friend here. - Can things get any worse? - What? What happened? He didn't look upset. - That's Rami. He's always playing the part. He wants me to get a job right away or he's gonna take my car and cut me off! - So get a job. - I have a huge trust fund. I don't need a job. - I know, but your dad controls it. - Don't call him my dad! - Don't you wanna be your own man? - There is nothing more manly than having power and money. I already have both. - So how'd it go? - Very well. - You still interested for moving up? - Yes sir. - That man with Jason, I'd like you to keep an eye on him. - Yes sir. - I don't trust him. He is not our kind. - Why is there an extra place set? - Your uncle is joining us. - I thought you hated him. - Katarina, we don't hate family. It's complicated, love. - Shall I get that? - Well yes, Khouri. That would be helpful. - Sorry ma'am. Right ma'am. Sorry ma'am. - It's probably already cold. - You made it. - She is certainly not the fastest servant. - Any news from Tatiana? - She's having a marvelous time. Sends her best to you both. Why do you ask? - Can't even check in with one of my closest friends? I find it a bit odd that she hasn't returned my calls. I hope I have not offended her. - She'll be returning soon. I'm sure she can't wait to tell you all about it. - Katarina, why don't you take your breakfast upstairs? You're acting a bit odd this morning. - You are refreshingly accommodating this morning. I don't trust this. What are you hiding? - I'm not like you. I have no need for secrets. - We all have secrets. - And what secrets are you hiding? - My secrets? Pay for you to live like this. - I am very grateful, Andrei. Your secrets are your own and my secrets are my own. - Same blood runs in both our veins. - That it does. - Khouri, coffee please! Is the next step in place? I will call you when I have the time and the date. I will be in the room myself. I want to see his face when it happens. - When what happens? - Nothing darling. Why don't you go clean your room? - We have a maid! - Now! - I'm surprised the bureau partnered you up with me for this assignment. Your first time out. - Seems pretty routine with me. Surveillance only, no contact with the perp. - You're the play by the book type of agent I take it. - He's coming through now. Like clockwork. Home at three, back to the restaurant at six. That's suspicious. - Did you see the occupants? - Damn, I missed the car. - It's probably just coincidence that that car pulled out after Andrei. - Coincidence? Nothing's a coincidence. I know that you're a rookie at this, but I need a partner I count on. Both of our careers are on the line here. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing personal, but I'm gonna ask for a new partner. We'll get you reassigned to... - What? - Nothing personal. I just can't risk you outing me. - I'm a happy man. - Your shipment has arrived? - Yes. And compared to my previous supplier, when I thought you said you were gonna sell me cheap guns, I thought you meant cheap. - How happy do you wish to be? - What do you mean? - I suppose you noticed my new friends. - The two guys in the suits? They stick out like sore thumbs. - I need a new place to conduct business, a new distribution solution for my supplier. - Drugs and guns, it's a felony offense. - Don't get caught. - Well I wouldn't be a businessman if I didn't say I was the least bit intrigued. What'd you have in mind, two of the most lucrative products out on my storefronts? - You can offer a buy back, get gun for special. - Let's work out the details. This calls for a drink. - Get Rami his usual. - What's up with that guy? Why does he keep staring at us? - He's always been odd. I've noticed since his wife mysteriously left town a few weeks back, it's worse. Rumor has it, she's sick. - Well if she's sick, why does he keep saying that she left town? - Katarina says it has something to do with being foreigners. They don't like to show weakness. - I don't know. There's more than just mistrust in that stare. Shoot. Jeez. I gotta get going. You mind giving me a ride to my car? I gotta be up early in the morning for the gym. I got a new client. Thanks buddy. - A shot of bourbon. - I assume our little problem has resolved itself? - What problem? - Put his drinks on my tab. - You got it, boss. - And the van? - On the competition's turf. Got a message and a solution. - Excuse me boss. - Why the fuck everybody interrupt my conversations? - I need your input. It's not good. - You bring me this problem because? Look, that's why I hired you. Now taker Coyote with you and do your damn job! - Come on, come on. - Stop. - No! - Clean up this mess and re-enforce with all the others that no one off the list will no longer be tolerated. - Good morning Mr. And Mrs. Amari. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Shall I set a plate for Master Jason? - Yes, set it right over there. - He'll be down shortly, Rami. He promised me last night he'll be up early for job hunting today. - You're expecting those promises to not be broken? - He wasn't even up when I came down. - Nelly. - You need to stop badgering Jason. It doesn't inspire him to listen. - I don't feed Master Jason with the same silver spoon you do, Sandra. He has no ambition, no thoughts of the future. If he doesn't get a job by the end of the week, I'm cutting him off. - You own dozens of corporations. I don't understand why you don't just give him a job. It makes no sense for him to job hunt. - We're not doing this right now. - Dad, can I get my allowance early since I finished all my chores? - Sure sweetie. Here you go. - Oh my God! - What is it, stocks down? - No. A body found here in Opulent shot in a van. - In Opulent? A body? Who? Where? - Nelly, you shouldn't be hearing this. - Yes mom. I'm gonna go see Katarina anyway. - Okay honey. Be careful. - Nelly will probably graduate college and get a job and have a family long before Jason gets employment. Hello? I gotta go. - This is certainly turning into an uneventful assignment. - You call two missing agents and their vehicle uneventful? - No bodies, no vehicle. They probably got paid off and they're on some tropical island somewhere. - Normally, I'd laugh at that, but not these guys. They were quality agents. Something bad happened here. I'm gonna find out. - At least we got eyes watching us. - Oh yeah 'cause that's gonna save us. - The meeting is set. Make sure every house is in attendance. Every boss needs to be there. We have no choice but to eliminate them. We can't flourish shadowed in fear of retaliation. - Is there a reason we're walking around in the indigenous slums? - Oh my gosh, Nelly, are you okay? - No she's not okay! She thought you were gonna murder us! Can we go somewhere less tetanusy please? - Yes princess Katarina. We'll go somewhere more suitable to your delicacies. - What was that with you and Tom? - What do you mean? - Do you like him? - No. I mean, maybe. - Hey! - Yeah. - Good job, kid. - It's gonna be all right. I'll take care of everything, okay? - No problem. - Give me a scotch. Save the rocks for Ricky's face. Remi's boy told me about your heroics. - I don't know if I'd call them heroics. - Andrei thought it was. That's why he offered you a gig. - I got a good job at the gym. I plan on working up to weekend manager. After that, who knows. - And that's your goal? - My grandpa was a cop, a great one. - That's the reason you're turning this down? It's a legit gig if it makes a difference. - I'll give it some thought. The job at the gym is part-time. I could use the extra income for the house. - The house? - It was paid for a long time ago. My grandpa took out a mortgage after my grandma got sick and he died a few weeks after she did. - What about mom and dad? - My mom passed away when I was a kid, dad took off to the war. He never wrote, never tried to contact her. She used to tell me he didn't even know I existed. That's that. - A lot of us came back from that war, couldn't go back to our old lives. - We have new employee? - Yes sir. Thank you. - Believe me, you will earn every penny. - We have a problem. - This is no way to start a conversation with me. - Andrei, if I could handle this myself, I would do it. - Must I handle everything? What is it? - One of our girls is partially missing. - Partially? What's this mean, partially? - The rest of her is missing. - Get Coyote on this and clean up. Find the rest of her. Who booked this client? - No one was on the books and no one saw him come in. - Is there video? - Coyote is on that now. First thing he asked for. - Close down brothel for tonight and give the girls an extra bonus for the money they lose. Lock the back door, nobody going in and out except for the front restaurant. - Even the girls? - The girls stay put. Have kitchen bring them meals. Tell Angelo he's in charge. - Will do. - Jesus. - I take it you know what this means. - What is it with Russians and body parts? - It's better than the heads Americans send. - Any idea who this may be? - The new one, Gina. - Maybe it was personal, something before she came here. - Does it matter? - No, I guess not. - I want you to find who did this. Then find the rest of her, preferably alive. - Is this something special? - She was my property. I want it back. - I'm out front and my car's getting lots of attention. - You all right? - Thanks man. I owe you one. - Make it a six pack, we're even. - This guy. Meet Donnie. - I finally get to meet Rick's newest project. - He's my friend. - It's like a project, man. Friend Jason, very nice to meet you. I wouldn't be driving a car like that around here if you want no trouble, right? You guys good? - Yeah. - Thanks man. - I'll see you guys. - Bye. Should've asked you to drive that old station wagon in your gardener's, man. - No worries dude, it's cool. - I changed my mind. - About? - About the extra income car connection. - What's going on? - Dude, the bank's foreclosing on my place. I don't know what the heck I'm gonna do. I just got another job offer by Andrei. Between that and the gym, I don't think I'm gonna have enough to cover it in time. - What about a loan? - A loan, really? Nobody's gonna give me a loan, man. - I will. - I'm not gonna ask you to do that for me. - You're family. Besides, I know a way we can make that money back a hell of a lot quicker than a couple part-time jobs. - Really? I'm listening. - Maria, you did right to alert me. Anything seem suspicious? - No sir, just odd. They wanted to wait here to speak with you. - And Tatiana? - Sambor is with her. - Uncle. - So nice to see you. Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm just a little shaken up. - Then I suspect there is some reason, some valid reason for you to be in my home, uninvited? - Our piano was out of tune. - Uncle, don't be upset with mother. She's just here for me and what happened. - I am having this thoroughly investigated and I promise I will find out why and who. - The who, I'm not sure of. The why, it's a takeover plot. - And this is the first you tell me? - I just heard about it. - Hear, what this mean hear, from who? - Andrei, you made a lot of enemies before we left Russia. Our identities are not fool-proof, ours or yours. - Get to the point. - You are delving deeply into international endeavors. Is it possible that you've gotten onto the Yakuza's radar? - Tell me what you think you know. - You've been sloppy with your work, you've been sloppy with your identity, what kind of man in hiding gets his name plastered on every business in town, what kind of criminal runs for a town mayor? - Sloppy, this is not sloppy, this is smart. What criminal in hiding would run for mayor? Besides, I am not criminal, I am businessman like any American businessman who hides his accomplishments behind contracts and lawyers. - When it all comes crashing down, remember, I warned you. - Good afternoon, Jason. Andrei and your dad both told me you might be coming in. - They did? - Yes. Said that you were investigating a few job options and that our bank might be one of them. - Actually, we're here regarding an investment I'm about to enter into. I think real estate is a viable commodity at this point, nothing speculative of course. - Do you have a property in mind? - Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. - Wait here a moment and I'll grab the branch manager. - Really? - How are you gonna get this house from Rami? - I'm not. I'm gonna use my slush fund. - Slush fund? - My personal savings fund, backup money I save for every time my dad put a freeze on my other accounts. - Look, thanks. This means a lot to me. - No problem. It's only $10,000, didn't even put a dent in my balance. Besides, our new business venture will surely give you the cash you need to pay me back. - Wait, wait, what venture? - How are you at distribution and sales? Hey man. - What took you so long? I was starting to get worried. - I've got you all set up. You're gonna be making so much money. - I kept thinking that everyone knew why I was here. - I know the feeling. - You both will be thanking me when your pockets are stuffed with money, easy money. Remember, just the pharmaceuticals to high schoolers you don't know and save the coke for the rich kids you know and we trust. Any questions? - No man, I'm good. - Get out of here. The supplier knows you're coming. - He's just a kid. - A soon to be rich and popular kid thanks to us. - It's not helping. - It was his choice. He does the pickup and sales. No drugs pass through our hands. Everybody wins. You're the one with the sentimental family home to lose. - Move the placard closer to the building. I don't want anybody tripping on it. - Here's the food you requested, Mr. Mikhailov. - Take it over to the men in the van, with my compliments. - No thank you, ma'am! We're fine! - Compliments of Mr. Andrei! - What? - With Mr. Andrei's compliments. - No, no, no thank you. - I can't leave until you take this, so perhaps you just take it so I can get back to work. - Seriously? Can we arrest her? - Mr. Mikhailov, if you would, just take a quick walk through with Maya, make sure that everything's up to your expectations for this evening. - Good. I wanna make sure the entertainment's loud enough so none of the conversations from the meeting can be overheard. - And all security will be dressed as staff to ensure no one gets too close. - Good. You tell the escort, tell him this is chair filler duty only. I don't want any physical connection to personal proposition to be made of any kind. - Understood. Jing! I've alerted all staff to be here at 5PM and guests should arrive at 6PM. - All members have been informed Miss Maya. - Great. Go keep an extra eye on the girls tonight, okay? - Yes Miss Maya. - They're not moving as fast as they used to. I cannot keep purchasing merchandise that doesn't turn quickly. - Guns are one of the fastest selling commodities. What are you doing wrong? - What am I doing wrong? Nothing. People just don't wanna buy them. - Who have you approached? - Everybody Andrei. If the public doesn't have a need for the guns, they're not gonna purchase the guns. - Then change need. - How? - TV newscasters always like to report on increasing crime spreading out from inner city like Indigent. A news segment about home intrusion, stolen property spreading into upscale community of Opulent. Follow that with one of your commercials. Increase crime, increase demand, marketing 101. Now go do this. - Nelly, you have a visitor! - Hi Tom. - Hey. I just wanted to stop by and make sure you're okay. - I'm okay. It was just a little scary. Tom, are you okay? You look damp. - Look, don't say anything, okay? - You aren't into those pills going around school, are you? - I just wanted to try it, and just this once. - I almost lost my best friend today. I can't lose you to something stupid. - I won't do it again, I promise. - Okay. - You're gonna love this. - I love this country. You just get everyone something to be afraid of and they throw money at you. - Crime is spreading from the inner cities to our once safe and elegant neighborhoods. It's time you protected your families and loved ones. Time for you to take control of your loved ones and your property with guns from Andrei's Gun Shop. Come down and make a selection. We're firing away for you. - Now, go make crime in neighborhood for news to report on and show this commercial after six o'clock news. Now go! I love this country. - Hey Frank. I just wrapped up. The ring's all yours. I told the guy to swap out the ropes for your wrestling. - I don't know why they bring in those boxers anyway. Way too long of a fight, and all those rules? - It brings in a different crowd and more money for the boss and for us, right? - Then you got those damn kick boxers. - Really Frank? You really wanna do this? - What? - Let's see what you got. Come on. No gloves. - Here we go. - Gentlemen! - Good fight. Angelo. - I am going to enjoy this, you two boys in the ring together. We're almost sold out. Andrei wants to bring in a team for security. - Why do we need more security? - For your safety and your protection. - Dare I ask? - Word's got out pretty far and wide. There's some guys from LA who may be showing up here. They're big-time offshore betters and they're also very sore losers. - Well you tell Mr. Mikhailov that we're very grateful for the help. - Do you think the rumors are true? - What rumors are those? - Andrei being a Russian mob boss? - No. I heard he was Russian royalty or something like that. - I'm pretty sure, and Angelo's his brigadier. - No, no, someone's pulling your leg, man. - Wanna bet? $500. - $500? Sure. I like taking your money. - Come on. - So is it a deal? Yours will be free if you get enough of your own clients. There's no risk. Your contact to get the stuff looks as innocent as a kid in Santa's lap. Between the pills and your workout training, you'll have one of the hottest bodies in town. - All right, but do you think maybe we could do like a trial run, maybe a little sample? - Nothing in life is free, babe. - Hey buddy, ready to head out? - Gotta go. I'll come see you tomorrow to see if we have a deal. - New girlfriend? - Sort of. - Look, I don't think I can do this. - We talked about this. The sooner we start this, the sooner we make our own legit business. Hey man, you're the one who wanted fast money to pay back the mortgage I paid for you, but if you don't want to. - No, I wanna pay it back as quickly as possible, but after that, we're done dealing, right? - Of course. - Cool. - Send these off at the high school. - Wait, high school? Dude, that's messed up. - They're just pills, harmless study aids, high volume cash, it's not blow. - Who do I give it to? - His name is Thomas. All right? - All right. - Excuse me, Mr. Andrei? Mr. Andrei. - What? - I hear that you are generous to people who have certain information. - Some say. - And on a side note, I enjoy your products and when money allows for it. - This information? - It's about your competition. I hear they have some really, really good prices. - Who might my competition be? - I don't know exactly. I just hear they're around and they just started dealing, but I know some of their pushers and I know where they're dealing. - So if you go for a ride with one of my boys, you can show him who these guys are? - Yeah, I could do that, and you'll be able to show your appreciation? - Take this man for a ride in one of your less conspicuous vehicles. He'll show you the location he's talking about. - Yes sir. - Then take him to clean up building. - Thank you. Thank you Mr. Andrei. Hey, hey easy! - Keep that up man. Your house will look like the rest of ours. - I don't know Donnie. Sometimes I think about just giving up, moving. - Man, I get out of this hell hole if I could. - Yeah? Go where? - Anywhere, man. Anything's gotta be better than this. Yo, who goes around slamming windows in broad daylight? - Look man, just go on your way. We don't want any trouble. - Look man, we don't want any trouble. - Hey, hey, hey! - I need an ambulance, fast! 3174 Duff! - This must be an important study group at the library. - Mom, you constantly get after me to fix up and when I do, you still can't be pleased. - Who all are you meeting with? - Sally's coming and she's got a friend my age she wants me to meet. - And the friend's name? - Mom, I haven't met her so why would I know her name? - It is a school night. Be home by nine. - I know that look. - Don't happen to have an extra PI hanging around, do you? - This must be something really serious or you're being over dramatic. - Probably both. - What brings such a concern look on your face, my love? - I know it's silly, but I think Nelly is lying to me about her study group tonight. - I'm on it. My wife is always suspicious of Nelly. - And you are not? - Not at all. My little baby is the perfect angel. Now it's those teenage boys that are coming over and that's another story. - I never have children, but Katarina, she's like my own. - Doesn't bother you when she goes out on a date? - She doesn't date. - How do you do that? - We keep her close and preoccupied. We keep her days and extracurriculars on a tight schedule so she can get into a top university. She doesn't need to know we were gonna buy her way in. Hard work ethic is good to instill in our youth. It also kills two birds, one stone. Excuse me, I'll be right back. I have a feeling we may have a problem with tonight's entertainment. The fight will be publicized and televised on all the major networks. Who is it? - Angelo. - Come. - I'm sorry, I don't wanna interrupt, but I thought you oughta know. I just got a call from one of the guys down at the arena. Apparently, we have an issue with one of the wrestlers. - And you couldn't just call me because? Speak! - Apparently, the guy wants a bigger cut and a take of the other wrestlers. He says he's a bigger name. - The egos of these people. You think we're dealing with Hollywood actors. Tell them this, whoever wins gets double, but based on the percentage of the house take-in. - That just made this even more interesting. Put a grand down for me on the bald guy. - You'd bet a grand on some fighter. You don't even know his name. - Woman's intuition. - Let us hope it is not inside information. You know, maybe something Andrei should know? - Yes. I only bet when I know I will win. First, ringside advantage. He knows your ropes. Plus, he's had a few years to perfect his moves in your arena. - Go on. - The opponent is afraid of you and you'll be sitting ringside. His manager is putting the pressure on him by threatening him and if he doesn't win, he's gonna drop him. That adds to his distraction. - I pity the man who would underestimate you. They wouldn't stand a chance. You can go. - There you go. Nice. Nice. There you go. Hold on, hold on. Got it. Let's go, let's go. There we go, there we go! Talk later. What's this about? - Fuck you think this is about wise guy? - Look, I didn't help out with anything and I didn't agree to anything. - We want to enlist you... for a sting operation, at least for this one. - I'm sorry, why me? - Your record's clean. You've got no connections as far as we could discover that would compromise an investigation. - What investigation? - Andrei Mikhailov. - You mean to tell me the stories are true? He's really Russian mafia? - Let's just say he's a person of interest. - We need your help. - We need somebody he's seen around enough to be on the inside, but with no allegiance to the drug war. Do you consent to help us? - Look, I don't advocate criminal activity, but I'm no rat. - What about the drug sales? We know all about your transgressions. It's all on tape. - Look, you've got the cleanest record of anybody you hang with. If you wanna keep it that way, you'll help us with this investigation. - There's no danger involved? - Follow all our directions. You'll be just fine. You'll be wearing this. - Jesus. - That's to your phone. We'll use a roving bug, can be activated remotely without any physical access. - We'll contact you, discreetly, if we need anything, so keep your phone close. Be ready for our call. - As much as I'm enjoying the breakaway from the club, I get the sense that this is more than just a girl's afternoon out. - I don't know why the boys don't give you more credit. You're smarter than your station. - I like to keep them on their toes. - You know, you are the only one who isn't afraid to speak freely. Brave choice. Are you happy working here? - Women in my position have learned to not think about happy. - Are you satisfied being here, working for Andrei? - I appreciate the generosities your family has extended me by giving me this position. - And by being where you are, you have a lot of dirty work to cover whenever necessary. If you were able to earn a living without having to answer to Andrei, would you take it? - Like I said before, I appreciate the generosities your family has extended me. I'll well paid and I consider this home, but I know if I try to leave, one phone call to immigration and I'm gone. - And Andrei holds that threat over your head? Maya, let's talk soon. I might have an alternative situation for you. - We can't possibly cater both the wrestling event and the after party. - Hire more people. - That's not possible. There's not enough time. My kitchen staff can't handle both events. - I was not asking. Leave it on the counter. - Hey Maya, have you heard from Lance? He hasn't showed up to work for the past two days. I tried calling his cellphone, he didn't answer. - The other day when he was in Andrei's office, he had to take a personal phone call. Family emergency. If you excuse me, I have to work out some things for the events. Jing! Yes. Rick's asking about Lance. Of course. Will do. - That should do it. Have you confirmed with the temp staff people for the servers and the kitchen help? - Yes ma'am. - Good. Hi honey. You look nice today. - I have a job interview. - Your father would be so proud. - Why is he doing this? - Jason, most young men are already climbing the corporate ladder. You're a bright boy. You need to get your career started. - This is one interview you can't miss. - I didn't know you'd be home so early. - Well I miss my beautiful wife. - See, you should be more like your father. - He's not my father. - What was that? - Actually, I have been interviewing. I just haven't found anything that fits yet. - Whatever you choose, I'm sure they'll love you. - You haven't reached out to any of the contacts I've given you. You don't have an allowance coming in, yet you have money to spend. Something doesn't add up. - You probably won't like it, but I took money from the fund grandpa left me. It's my money! - Hello. - I hear a congratulations were in order. - For what? - The gun shop, my friend. - So many regulations just to have a few semi-automatic firearms in my store. - Now you are legitimate weapons dealer, first one in our town. Will I see you and Sandra tonight at the fight? - Yeah, you will. - Tatiana, Tatiana! Tatiana, I will never leave your side ever again. - Andrei? - Tatiana, I waited so long to hear your beautiful voice. Come on, let's get your downstairs. - Please, go, go mingle. I'm fine here. - The boss' orders, ma'am. - So many things have changed. Andrei has changed. - He's had to deal with a grave of many issues in your absence. - Olga has told me how kind he's been to them and this event, it's so out of character for him to have a business that's so people oriented. - Now that you mentioned it. What happened to you? You've been demoted? - No. Mr. Mikhailov asked me to cover security, observe any unusual guests. It's my cover. - Cover. Some things never change. - Restaurants and sporting events, cutthroat industries. - Especially in a wild town like Opulent. - Is this crowd too much for you? - Nyet. It's just opposite, it's invigorating. - You always did enjoy the social life. - And I'm delighted you made one while I was away. - Now that you're in capable hands, men, if you'll excuse me. I'm gonna go check on the kitchen, make sure they're keeping up with the after party. - Hey man, let the ladies go! - Hey man, I paid extra money for this good service! They both taking me on a ride! - Hey man, I've heard rumor this stuff existed. I didn't think it was true. - I think it's best if you just forget about it. - But those girls, they were pretty young. - If it's any consolation to you, they're both legal age and in three months from now, they're gonna go back to Mexico with a box full of cash. - And that makes it okay? - Let's pretend it never happened. - I'm so glad you came out tonight. I'm really surprised your parents were okay with it. - Actually, they don't know I'm here. Everyone's at the fight. - Look at Nelly, our little rebel. - Hey, got anything? - Hey man, not cool. Come back tomorrow. - Tomorrow won't work. - I'll be right back. - Are you okay with this? - With what? - What JJ's doing. - With him, it's no big deal. His friend's just shy with girls. - I know what he's doing. He's dealing. - Hey guys, sorry about that. You want another one, man? It's the last one I have. - Tom, what are you doing? - Hey man, chill. It's the last one. - Are you okay? - Just a little lightheaded. I'll be good. - Maybe you should lay down on the way home. - You'll be okay, man. - He's not breathing, he's not breathing! - I need to know what happened and now! - He just got sick so we brought him here. - Is there anything else you're not telling us? - Are you the parents? - We're Nelly's parents. I called Tom's parents, but there was no answer. I sent a driver over there. - Is he gonna be okay? - I really need to speak to the parents. Tom took fentanyl. - God, we moved here to get away from that stuff! The doctor said Tom took fentanyl. Do you know where he's getting this? - He said he would stop! - Are you taking it? - No, I promise I'm not! I haven't taken any drugs! - Why haven't you told us about this? - Not now, Rami. - I really need to get back. It doesn't look good. - This place is a goddamn mess! The tables are all set wrong! Get your shit together! Where's Maya? She should be here by now! - I'm right here. - I leave you three messages! - Well I'm here. It's only 9AM. - You know, today's an important meeting. You gotta go beyond the norm and you know it's important! - It's the monthly boss' meeting! What's so different about today? - I'm sorry, when you think it's your job to ask me questions? Save your lip for the johns! - Brother. - Not now Olga! - Tense as always. - I should know better than to rile him up like that. - That's my favorite time to get him riled up. Big boss is coming today. - And since no one knows who the big boss is, he's totally out of his element. - I think I'll sit in on this one. - You know how he feels about women in business. - And that's why I am where I am and you are where you are. - I'll call this meeting to order since our mystery guest of honor seems to be delayed. Yes sir. Yes sir, everyone is here except for the Pakhan. - I was the brigadier on the phone. Andrei heard a rumor that big boss was coming in. Brigadier doesn't want us to embarrass him, be kind to the boss of all bosses. - Thank you for the information. You know, we women don't always know these things. - Come in! So, what does this mean? Why you keep me in the dark? We may not get along, but we are still family, and you, the Pakhan, boss of all bosses! How does this make me look? - You are getting very sloppy. - Sloppy? - Andrei,. You are completely distracted, how you spread the story that Tatiana was on vacation when in reality, she was bed bound and in stupor most of the time. The FBI has been tailing and you provoke them? Now there's the disappearance of some of your working girls. Shall I go on? - No. - You are completely losing your edge. You are being dangerous to be in business with. Word is, you're under surveillance by several government entities. - If you mean the men in the van, I took care of that. - You took care of that. You don't think two FBI men gone missing is not gonna alert them that you're more than a person of interest? There are going to be some changes. I'll send the word out to you. Us bosses, we don't like loose ends. - It's my grandpa. That's the day he moved in. - Now I know where you get that sappy personality of yours. Inherited it. - I wish. He was the best. I got something to show you. Hang on. - What are you doing? You moving furniture? - Hold on a second. Here, check this out. It's his, it's original. - This looks like it belongs in a museum. Why didn't they move away from here when the neighborhood started to change? - I don't know. I think they always thought my dad was gonna come back. Part of me still does. I got something I gotta talk to you about. - That phrase never leads to anywhere good, at least not when my parents say it. - It's about the drug dealing. I just can't do it with you. That goes against everything my grandparents stood for, like that kid. Remember that kid Thomas, made the delivery? That was supposed to be harmless. Look, I just can't live with that on my conscious, man. - I guess I could take lower monthly payments, something that works with your current salaries. - Really, you'd do that? - You're my friend. That's what friends do. - Thanks, man. I appreciate it. - I'm gonna take off. - No, absolutely. - We'll work it out, okay? - Absolutely. Thanks man, I appreciate that. Hit me up later. - Hey Jason. - Hey Angelo. - Ricky, hi. I got your address from the court clerk's office. How long have you lived here? - All my life. - What was your mother's name? - My mom? - Was your mom named Rose? Rose? - How'd you know that? - It was on the title, the clerk's office. Your dad. - I just call him deadbeat dad. My mom wrote him a lot when he was in 'Nam. He never responded. Never came back. - I'm sorry. Andrei wanted you to have this for the nice work. - Thanks, thanks. Come on in. You can come all the way in. It's not haunted. You look like you're ready to see a ghost. - We need to talk. - I know. I really wanna find a way to keep my job, but in all honesty, Angelo, I can't condone what's going on. I don't even understand how you can. - If not me, somebody else. - You're there by choice with that piece of shit Andrei. - Andrei saved my life. I was in a bad place once. He gave me this job. I owe him a lot. - Then who are you really? - I was in the 'Nam. Six months in and I got captured. Spent the next five years in a cage, eating rats, getting my ass kicked every day. - Jesus. - I should've died. I was dead already. When I came home, it was even worse. Everything was broken. My mother and father, they passed away. My sister moved on. She didn't want any part of me. I don't blame her. But there's only one person that I wanted to see, that I needed to see, and I didn't, I couldn't. She's the only thing that kept me going. I tried once, I tried once. Drove out to her house, she was sitting on her porch. She didn't see me so I pulled over to the side of the road. I just watched. She hadn't changed a bit from the moment I left. Then a little kid runs out yelling mommy, mommy, look what I made. I wasn't gonna interfere with that. I would've just screwed it up. - I guess you know what it feels like to lose everyone you love. - I gotta go. Someday you can buy me a beer and tell me all about that beautiful mother of yours. Nice work, Ricky. - Thanks. - Tatiana, I am so happy you recovered from the attack, Tatiana. You have always been a good friend. - Seeing the two of you makes me feel even better. - Uncle has told you the plans? - He said something about fresh start. - You have always been one of my closest friends. After such horrific attempts on your life and your family, I don't feel that it's safe for you to be here. - Did I hear my name mentioned? - Da baby. Olga is talking about relocation plan. - Seems timely, my dear. I just have a couple things to put into place, and then we'll be free to travel. - That does not sound like you. - After the attack, I don't want to take anymore chances. - So enchanting. - Where's Angelo? - I think he's in back with Maya. - Find him. Tell him to come to my office. - I've come into some information that is very upsetting to me. - What information? - There is a mole in our circle. - A mole? Come on. - I want you to find him and I want it finished before the day is over, you understand me? - Absolutely. What information do we have? - Information is your job! Otherwise, what do I need you for? Now you do this job for me or not? - Yes, sir. I won't disappoint. I'll wait. - Here. We've been keeping an eye on him. - It's a pleasure doing business with you. Hi Ricky. I need to see you, quick. I could use another hand. I'll swing by and pick you up. - Americans could never fully appreciate the spontaneous use of violence. I would never have guessed you were my mole. I guess that's what makes you so good. - I'm not the rat. I swear, honest. They approached me, they threatened me with drug charges. I didn't tell them anything! - Come on Andrei, he's just a kid. Let's cut him some slack. He could've said a lot more and he kept his mouth shut. That's worth something. - Seeing as you're my rat and the FBI needs a dealer, why don't we kill two birds with one stone? Find out what Rick's true loyalties lie. - What do you have in mind? - For reasons beyond my control, I need to disappear. You'll help me with that I won't shoot you where you stand for bringing the cops to my door! - How are we gonna pull that off? - I have plan. Give this to the feds. Tell him I'll be here in my office alone until 1PM tomorrow, and I will be alone and unarmed. - Wait, I don't understand. - You don't need to understand. Now go! - Hey Mikhailov, we got a warrant for your arrest. Get your ass up you piece of shit. - Get up! - Been waiting a fucking long time for this. - Let's move! Move it! - Shake this son of a bitch down. We got you, you piece of shit. - I don't know. Why is he being arrested? - I don't know. Oh my god! - Is he okay? - No, he's done. He's done. - So, what now? - With my brother's empire finally impotent, only impediment in our way is Rami.
