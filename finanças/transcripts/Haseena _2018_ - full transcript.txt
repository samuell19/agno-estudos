The Beauty We've been waiting for you! Where the hell were you? Dad had to leave for London. Then I had to help mom with some work. Okay, tell me, why you guys called me here? -As you know. We fail every time. -What? -I see. -And you never fail. So, you want me to fail along with you. -Why do you always get it wrong? -No. You guys are wrong. All right, listen to me, this time we also want to pass. -Okay. -Work hard. Study. -We have a plan. -Okay. The plan is that we'll go on a pilgrimage. -I see. -Visit Mother Goddess. -Okay. -Seek Her blessings. -And pass with great grades. -All hail Mother. -All hail Mother. -You see, you've talked some sense for the first time. It's good, go and seek blessings and expect to pass. -Visit? We can't visit Her without you. -I see. You see, you have a better image in our families. -I see. -For our families, we are useless. -Yes. -And if you agree to come with us then we'll get the permission just like that. Okay, so, you do want to fail me. -No, man, it's not like that. -Then? Tell me? Talking about going to a pilgrimage does not suit you guys. -He got us. -He is our true friend. -Obviously. -Rahul, tell him the truth. -Now, listen. -Yes. We are planning a trip to Goa. Goa? Have you lost your mind? We have our exams and you want to go for a trip? No. I'm not going to Goa with you. -Hear us out. -What? Shraddha and Shikha are also going with us. Great! So, you've planned it all. I don't want to be dragged into this mess. -Listen... -No. -Sorry. -Hear us out. We've thought about you too. -How? -We've invited your girlfriend, Sweety? -Sweety. -Yes. Sweety. -It's not possible. -Is it? Shraddha and Shikha, both are in Sweety's house to convince her strict father. -Now say. -Really? Really. Please, uncle. -Please. -No, it's not possible. Have you guys gone mad? You have your exams and you are talking about a trip. Uncle, at least hear us out. If Sweety goes to pay a visit to Mother Goddess... she'll definitely top the college. Yes, uncle! She'll pass with good grades. Easier said than done! Good, no need to study, just seek blessings and you'll pass. -Do you think I'm a fool? -Yes. -What? -No, no. We are trying to tell you that seeking blessings can help us with our grades. And your consent will make the journey memorable. Please, uncle. Please. Dad, please allow me to go. I'm not alone. They are with me. If I go out, I'll get blessings of God, -and some change in oxygen too. -What? So, you've been breathing carbon-di-oxide here? What's with the change in oxygen? No, uncle, you are misunderstanding. What she meant was going out can be helpful for a change. Fresh air will keep her mind fresh and we can study better. -Right? -Yes, right. Listen. I've never allowed her to go out of the house alone. But, she is not alone. We are her friends. Dad, please allow. Okay, but there's a condition. Promise me you'll take good care of my daughter. Uncle, don't worry at all. Trust us. Okay, go seek Mother's blessings. Rohit will pass anyway. Why to take him along? Shit! Aunt, the thing is, we don't want Rohit to only pass. -We want Rohit to top. -Yes. And mummy was telling that Ms. Agarwal has challenged you... that her son will top. I challenge you, this time my son will be the topper. Or else, I'll pay for the party next time. Okay, if I win, I'll pay for all the parties ahead. -Do you accept? -Yes, I do. -Aunt, just imagine. -Yes. If Rohit tops... you will be respected even more in the society. I hope you understand. Aunt, all you need to do is imagine! Divine blessings is a necessity to be a topper. Say yes. -Fine. -Yes. I'll send Rohit with you guys to seek Mother's blessings. Thank you. -Done. Done. -But, mind you... if my son does not top... if my Rohit does not top... then you both can forget this address. -Aunt, don't worry. -Not at all. -What are you saying? -Rohit will top for sure. Done. Hundred percent. May the Goddess protect you. -All hail Mother Goddess. -All right. -All hail Mother Goddess. -Yes. -Get beer. -Yes. -Go get some. -Get chilled ones. -You talk such rubbish. -Hey, 12 cans of beer. -How much? -540. -Here you go. -Enough now. -Here's the beer. -I'll drink the most. -I'm thrilled. -Goa is for fun. -Go help him. -We'll of course have fun.

Get him. Run. Run. Don't leave him. -Actually... -No, not even a word! You both have caused problems. You lie and bring me to Goa. Then you turn my girlfriend into a Goddess and send it to my mother. I'll be doomed if my mother finds out. -Your mother... -Will not say a word. Of course. Now we couldn't go to a temple and take a picture, right? We acted according to the situation. Just chill.

As if it was 50 gallons of oil for it required two people to deliver it. Stop fooling around. And get her out. I mean the girl is smart. He is right. She is very smart. Didn't you see? How she was gesturing to us using her stuff as an excuse? -Yes. And what was she saying? -What? -You could need condom anytime. -Say. It means the chick is pretending on purpose. -Yes. -Then get her out immediately. Why aren't you trying to understand? We can share this cream. He is absolutely right. What rubbish. This is my house. Not a brothel. Why don't you understand? Listen. Come here. She has herself come to us to be had. We just have to have her. But what if mother comes? -Your mother... -Where is she? -To a kitty party. -So she'll come late. -We'll be done by then. -Yes. Yes. It won't take us too long. All right. If she agrees then I'll go first. Very good. Isn't your mother going to come now? Okay. Do this. You guys stay here. -I'll go convince her. -Go. Go. Go. How are you feeling now? How are you? All right? Did I disturb you? Ouch. Don't get up. Don't get up. Are you fine? Don't mind but can I ask you something? Go ahead. You're so gorgeous. So hot. So why do you this job of an ordinary salesgirl? You can get any job, isn't it? I'll get a job. And in fact, I did. But as you know. In today's world... people expect other things from a young and beautiful girl. I had been for an interview a few weeks ago. Hi, sir. I'm Pooja. I'm the worshipper. Just joking. Sir, here's my profile and certificates. I can see. I have certificates of some other activities too. I can see. -I've done MBA. -I can see. Where are you looking, sir? At what's visible. You're a file from head to toe. Just joking. Okay tell me. What package do you expect? -Sir, no demands. -Oh no. You should get more than expectation. You'll just have to please our clients. That will be duty, sir. That's too good. Too cute. Before that, you'll have to please me. -Sir, I didn't understand. -Let me explain. Come. Sit here. From today you're my lap's top. What? This time not joking. Come. Come on. I won't be getting what I want here. I had imagined I would convince the girl. But the girl is extremely dangerous. -What happened? -Nothing. Nothing. You should quit jobs at such places. You shouldn't work for such people. I would've killed him. In today's world good people are rare. For example... If I had got injured somewhere else.

A girl came to my office and robbed me in broad daylight. Sit. Sit. Relax. Tell me what happened. My name is Varun Sehgal. I put a job ad in the newspapers for the vacancy of a secretary for my office. So, a girl came for the interview. -And... -Relax. My purse. My watch. My diamond ring. My money. My laptop. She made off with everything. How is this possible? Is there no staff in your office? The strength of my staff is 209. But... See this. This pen drive. It has all the footage of the CCTV. Watch what she did. Watch. Watch. Hi, sir. I'm Pooja. -Yes. -This is my profile and certificates. -Sit down. -Thank you. Sir, it's so hot in here. The air conditioner is fine. It's the job of a personal secretary. You have experience, right? Yes. Yes. I have total experience. Sir, as it is, what's the job of a personal secretary? Taking care of every personal thing of her boss. Right, sir? Right, sir? Yes. Sa... What salary do you expect? Whatever you give. -All right. -Thank you so much, sir. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you so much, sir. Mr. Sehgal, what happened to you was really bad. But you're also at fault in this. You gave her the chance to rob you. Officer, what could I do? Little did I know she'll knock me unconscious and rob me. I have suffered a loss of 25 lakhs at least. For your information let me tell you. This girl's name is Haseena. And she is a professional criminal. She goes to posh areas. Targets rich people. Robs them. And the law will get her very soon. The law might have long arms. But they're still very short to catch Haseena. Because it is not possible to catch Haseena. It is impossible. Because Haseena kills with her style and not with weapons. Don't go anywhere. Just wait and watch. Yes. Let's do this. Let's go inside together. -And drive that girl out. -Yes. Cool. -Okay. -Come on. Come on. Mom's here. -Your mother... -Is here. -Come on. -Let's see. Who is he? Rajan, it's not mother. It's a kid. I'll tell you. Hold on. Faddu. Why are you here? It's something serious, darling. It's nothing serious. Go back quietly. -I have exams. I want to study. -Let me see what you're studying. Hey! He won't listen. Faddu. Who the hell are you? I see. So this is the study that's happening. -What do you mean? -I mean a girl came here an hour ago. -He knows. -She's still here. What girl? Hey... There is no girl here. Out. -Go. -Don't lie. Barack Obama has seen. -Barack. -Barack Obama. Obama. -I'm Barack. -I'm Obama. So... So what are you going to do? -Want me to show what I'm going to do? -Yes. Rohit, tell them. Faddu, forgive them. Isn't it? Come on. Why are you afraid of this kid? Hey... Whom did you call a kid? I'll go out and tell everyone that there is a girl inside. Hey... How dare you threaten us? -Hey... -You guys keep quiet. I'm talking to him. Faddu, forgive them. Let's settle it between us right here. Isn't it? I can. It's the matter of a second girl. That's why I'll take a good 1000 rupees. -1000 rupees? -Yes. Give 1000 rupees. You never have money. Here you go. Here you are, Faddu. 1000. Listen. Don't tell anyone there is a girl in this house. Okay? -Go. -See you, darling. Let's go. Who is he? Darling, from today you too are in my database. And 1000 is for an hour only. Drive her out fast. Go. Out. Out. Barack. Obama. Out. Quick. Who was he? Everyone had to come today of all days. -He was one awesome kid. -He is not a kid. He is a cannonball. Now get that girl out quickly. If we don't he'll gather the entire neighborhood here. He is right. -Come on. Come on. -Let's get her out. Excuse me. -Why did you take off your clothes? -Yes. You guys molested me. And you're worried about the clothes. Sorry. But why are you crying? What do I do if not cry? I've been dishonored. What's done is done. -Yes. -Now tell us. What can we do for you? One of you three will have to marry me. -Marry? -Yes. -Look, how is this possible? -Why isn't it possible? It was possible when you came to molest me. And it is not possible now? -Rahul, the girl is right. -Yes. -Rajan, you marry. -Yes. I... How can I marry? I am already engaged. See this. Last week. This is a silver ring. It is not used for an engagement. You're lying. I swear. I'm getting married next month. Do this. Rahul. You marry her. -Yes, you marry. -Are you mad? I have four sisters. Am I supposed to get them married first or get myself married first? -He is right. -You marry her. -Me. -You are not even engaged. You are good looking. -Yes. -Just a minute. -Do you believe in sun signs? -No. -Then we can never get married. -Why? Actually let me explain to you the concept. A boy who has Mars in his horoscope marries a girl who has Mars in hers. And you don't have Mars in your horoscope. So we just can't get married. You marry them. -Yes. -Him. -Mother is back. -Oh God. The wedding party is here. We are done. But you'll have to go and open the door. -Get up. -Mother. -I'm doomed. -Go. Look, please don't come out. We will handle the situation. -Please.
