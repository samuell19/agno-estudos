[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ALL: Hello. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] Boy, it's good to be home. Oh, my darling sons. How was the track today? Sloppy. Sloppy? We ain't had rain in weeks. Oh, some sow slopped beer in my hat. Oh, I'll get Joe to get you a new one. Me too, Ma. Hey, get this junk off this table here. Come on. Watch what you're doin'! My sandwich was in there! Hey, get me a drink, son. Mm-hm. Here. Water?! Don't you never do that to me again! Oh, here's Joe. Good evening, auntie dear. Cousin Moe, Cousin Larry. Did you wipe your feet? Yes, auntie dear. I had a wonderful day today. I-I fixed four rear ends. Two were trucks. What's for supper? TV dinners. Again? We ain't even got a TV. But Ma, only 2,037 more TV-dinner coupons and we get a set. Darling, Larry, you're so considerate of your mother. Why didn't you think of that? I did. That's why I been buying so ma-- Don't change the subject! Not so loud! You're a doll. Go wash the dishes and then clean out the hearth. Wash the dishes and clean out the hearth. I'll clean the hearth. I wish my fairy godmother would come along. I feel like a He-Cinderella. All you need is a glass slipper instead of a bone head. You'll miss me when I'm gone. Where are you going, Cinderella? To the ball? [ALL LAUGHING] No, I-I'm going on a camping trip with two weeks' vacation with full pay. Well, don't forget to leave money for the house. Hey, Joe. Is this cake for me? Wait a minute! That's mine! I bought that for you, auntie dear, for a going away present. Me? Oh, boy, a camera. This for me, Joe? No, that's for me. Hey. Wait a minute! [ALL SHOUTING] Wait a minute! That's mine. I'm going on a camping trip. MA: It's mine. JOE: Come on, let go. [MA GRUNTING] MOE: Give it to me, now. I'm gonna win a prize. All right, let him have his old camera. He can take pictures of brother Larry and I on the camping trip. Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm going alone. Alone? I take you in as my very own, and now you deny my sons, your loving cousins, the pleasure of your vacation. I'm sorry, auntie dear. I-I'm an ingrate, that's what I am. Cousin Moe and Cousin Larry, you can come on that camping trip with me. And I'll even let you use my ca-- Hey. It's your cake, auntie dear, but whose foot is that? You and your big feet. You wrecked my cake. Don't worry, auntie dear. I-I got another one. Hey, give me that. Wait, that's mine. [MA GASPS] [WHIMPERS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] I like this Facts and Figures magazine. Hey, Joe entered that candid camera contest. Give me the facts about it. Wait'll I look over the figures. What are you, an accountant? Come on. "Photo contest facts. First prize: $10,000." Can you imagine Joe winning a prize like that? [LAUGHS] No. [LAUGHS] Ten thousand dollars. [BOTH LAUGHING] He couldn't win 10,000 jellybeans. [BOTH LAUGHING] Hold still. Watch the birdie, the birdie. Hey, Larry, listen to this. "Flying saucers are real. "Scientists are convinced that space travelers "from other planets have visited Earth. But no one has gotten a picture of a flying saucer yet." Boy. That picture sure would win first prize. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] What are you looking for? With all that space up there, there might be a spaceship. And we could get the picture, and w-- Spaceship? Yeah. Come on. You with your spaceship. MOE: Hey, hey. It's blowing up a tornado. Stop shooing, squirrel. [CAMERA CLICKS] Thanks, squirrel. Boy. I'm sorry, squirrel, I have no nuts. Uh. Chewing gum. Boy, this picture. Oh, boy, oh, boy, did I get a picture! Oh, boy! Hey, something spoiled my snapshot. Hey, look. A flying saucer. That picture's worth a lot of dough. Quiet. We don't wanna let Joe know anything about this. Hey. That flying saucer must've landed over there back in the hills. Well, we'll borrow Joe's camera and take some close shots of it. Oh, boy, we're gonna be rich! We'll be worth a fortune. [GRUNTS] What's the matter with you? Come on. Get goin'. Loan me your camera. Sure. Take my picture. All right, close your eyes. Hey, wa-- Hey, wait. All set? Right. Right. Now listen, fellas, we'll all go in together. When we see a school of fish, let them have it. Right. Check. Let's go. All right. I wonder where that thing landed. Mars men. We're being invaded. Run for your life. MOE: Oh! Hurry up, Larry. Come on. Oh, boy. What's the matter with you guys? Hi, fellas. Howdy. They're such cowards. They thought you were Mars men. Mars men! [SCREAMING] [ENGINE STARTS] Hey. Fellas, wait for me. [CROWD CHATTERING] As president of Facts and Figures magazine, it gives me great pleasure to present you with the first prize, $10,000. [BOTH GASP] Thank you! Ladies and gentlemen, Facts and Figures magazine is always happy to-- Hey, come back, you weasel. Any legitimate-- Excuse-- Ahem, sorry, folks. [CROWD CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] This beats slinging hash, doesn't it, baby? And how, you doll. Stick to me, girls, and you'll get a trip to the moon, one way. [GIGGLING] Kiss me, ducky. [SIGHS] [GIGGLES] Let's drink another toast to our heroes. Give me some more champagne. Okay, baby. Hey, it's empty. Oh, don't worry, we're lousy with champagne. Hey, Joe, come here. What is it, Cousin Moe? Get some more champagne. I can't, I'm busy. Well, drop what you're doing and get it. Okay, if you say so. [PLATES CRASH] I'll butcher that goose. [GRUNTS] [JOE GROANING] Why don't you look where you're going? You overstuffed bologna, I'll-- Moe, I-I took those photos. I should get some of that-- Shh! You tell anybody you took those photos, and I'll break every bone in your head. [GROANING] Do that again. Again. You do everything I tell you to. Go on! Fresh giggle water. Well, hurry up. Oh, keep your powder dry. Well, come on. [GRUNTS] What happened? Ha-ha-ha! That's good for you. That's good for you. That's bad for me. Wow. Oof. LARRY: I'm soaked to the skin. MOE: Me too. So you thought you could slip it over on us, eh? What are you talkin' about? Here's an enlargement of your flying saucer. The government checked it. It's nothing but a dirty paper plate with a gob of potato salad and jelly stains on it. You swindlers. That Joe, that double-crossing rat. Oh, we're innocent. We can explain this. Hm? Joey? JOE: Coming. [LOUD CRASH] JOE: What is it, Cousin Moe? Joe, tell these men the honest truth who photographed that flying saucer. You and Larry did, Cousin Moe. No, no, I mean who really did it. You held the camera and Larry snapped the picture. Yeah, we-- Why, you... Oh! Officer, take these swindlers out of here. Ma, get us a lawyer, a cheap one. Oh, my boys! Oh. Oh. [GASPS] [SOBS] Ooh, that double-crosser Joe! You. You ingrate, you worm! You boob! Ooh! You wolf! Ooh! You-- Oh! [GROANS] Oof. Get out of my house and never darken my door again. Get! Gee, I sure miss my cousins and my dear auntie, even if they are mean to me. Golly, if I could take a picture of a real spaceship, I bet they'd take me back. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ENGINE WHIRRING] Oh. I must be seeing things. That can't be a real spaceship. [LAUGHING] Nah. WOMAN: Do not be afraid. This is Elektra from planet Zircon. We want to make friends with you Earth people. We are going to land. Brace for landing. [SHIP RUMBLING] Heh. I must be dreaming. Ow! Not so hard. I didn't see anything, it was imagination. I know-- Hello. Hello. I'm Tyrin, this is Elektra. We heard what you said. Yes, and I just happen to have a very nice picture of a flying saucer. Gee, thanks. Gee, thanks, you're really a fairy godmother. Wow! What mamas. Say, do you mind if I take a picture of your, uh, spaceship? Help yourself. Certainly. Oh, boy. [CAMERA CLICKS] Sure. Thanks. Don't ever leave me. We must. The entire Earth is looking for us. But may we kiss you goodbye? May you? May you? Wow! [KISSING NOISILY] [SPACESHIP WHIRRING] Bye! Bye! Oh, boy, I got it made. I got it made! Oh, boy, will my cousins and my auntie. Boy, will they be-- Be happy when I get home and show them what I did. Oh, boy. You bet your life. Coffee. I don't wanna let that go to waste. Gotta take that in case I get thirsty on the way to see my cousin and my aunt. Can't... Get that. Oh, boy. Lettuce for a sandwich. Boy. You betcha. Oh. Ooh, wait. Hey. There maybe bears or something. I gotta protect myself. [GRUNTS] Oof! Ow! Oh, my-- A duck! What do you know? Oh, my boys. Ah, that worm, Joe. On account of him, we spent all night in jail. And we go to jail for keeps unless we get back the money. And we spent nearly all of it. Cousin Moe, Cousin Larry! There are real space people! Real girls. They kissed me. And I got a picture of a real spaceship. A-And you can say that you took it. Ah, you're not only crazy, you're a liar as well. And we don't want no part of you. Yeah, you got us in enough trouble already. [GROANING] We let him off pretty easy, didn't we? That does it. Hey. See this? BOTH: Yeah? [BOTH GRUNT] [BOTTLE CRASHES] [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Boy, this is the life. Oh. Oh. Oh, no. [BOTH WHINING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [CUCKOO CHIRPING] [♪♪♪]
