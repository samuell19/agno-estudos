--- subtitles by Rubens --- As a baker I've always found something magical about the mornings. You have the world to yourself. And I love being in my little sanctuary when no one else is around. As the aroma of breads and sweets begin to fill the air there's a little time left for me. And this is the time I love the most. It's a time that allows me to take risks. To try something new. Because I know the key to any successful dessert is consistency. Simply follow a time-tested recipe and you know what you're gonna get. Introduce a new ingredient at your own risk. The end result could be something new and wonderful. Or it could be a complete disaster. Howdy stranger. Oh, come on. It hasn't been that long since you saw me. Has it? I'm sorry Hannah, it's just so crazy. The station is still short-staffed. I get it. I do. Ships in the night, long hours... I know what I signed up for. - Is this... Wait. Is this treat... do you like like that, is that too much? - It's good. It looks really good. I'm gonna make it up to you, though. How about dinner tonight at Raven? I have a better idea. Why don't you come over? Eat. I'll make something special. Yeah? Do you need me to bring in anything? - Just you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sounds good. - I gotta go. I gotta go. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'll see you tonight, though. Ok? - Yes. Absolutelly. - Ok. - Ok. A kiss. I see you later See you later Good morning, ladies. - Good morning, Delores. - Oh, Hannah. I think I shall treat myself to a lemon tart today, please. Okay. I can't wait to hear all about your interview. - Interview? - Well, The Lake Eden Journal is doing a feature on my debut novel "A Match For Anna". - When am I getting a copy? - I will autograph you one right away. The launch party is this weekend. It is a Regency themed tequila. - Oh, I will dust off my bonnet. - Oh, that's perfect. Oh, Hannah, have you made any progress on the Menu? - Well, I was thinking... - Thank you. about making miniature cream puffs. Well, the menu must be true to the time period. I want my guests to feel transported back to 1820. Okay. I could make flummery. It's an oatmeal that's been boiled to a jelly-like consistency. - That's disgusting. - That's the 1820s. Just for you know, I have invited Norman to the party. You've invited half the town. As well he accepted. Despite the fact that you broke his heart. I didn't break his heart, mother. - Did he say that to you? - He didn't need to. I'm a writer, Hannah. I am very intuitive. Norman and I are friends. So, are you inviting him to your wedding? Oh, and speaking of which, I brought you a few magazines for research. And I've made just a few notes. Mike and I haven't even set a date yet. Sweetheart, a beautiful wedding doesn't just materialize overnight, it takes months of planning. Guest lists, caterers. Seasonal considerations. Will it be a spring wedding? Will it be a winter wedding? Oh, Hannah. I suggest you avoid a summer affair. Your hair we'll never hold up against that kind of humidity. We just got engaged. Six months ago. What are you waiting for? Hey, Jacqueline. I haven't seen you at the gym lately. How can you treat people like this? Don't you have any shame? I don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Ok, let's all just take the... - Oh, boy. - Oh, mine. - Are you OK? - Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - I'm so sorry. - It's OK. Karma, is coming for you. - Oh, my goodness. - I'm sorry. Oh, no... Oh. - Oh, look, Hannah. Are you all right? - Just peachy. I opened this morning as usual and everything seemed fine. But then I came back here and I found this. How much did they get? Nearly 2000 in cash from the fundraiser last week. Right. Anything else, any merchandise from here? I'm still taking inventories. It's the city manager. She's at a conference in St Paul. I haven't told her yet. - Yeah, go ahead. - Thanks. Hello. And were you on patrol last night? - I'm overnight all this week. - Okay, did you see anything? No. What about that? Still waiting for the city manager to release the security footage but we should have the next couple days. - What about the feed from the parking lot? - No cameras there. We been after the city forever about that. Well, this will help our case. Now the security guard did say something interesting. That the thief seem to know his routine, because he was patrolling the other side of the Rec Center when it happened. - Hannah. I haven't seen you in class. - Hi, Delly. Oh, I was helping Andrea with her move. Oh, how's she liking Seattle? She loves her new job but not so fan of the weather. Well, let her know that we missed her already. Hey, I haven't seen your mom at the bakery lately. - Yeah, she's just feeling a bit down. - I hope everything is okay. She's been having a tough go of retirement. I think she's feeling a bit lonely. You wouldn't have to be hiring? Just a few hours a week. - No, but I can ask around if... - That will be great. Oh, thank you. - Hey, Marco. - Afternoon, Hannah. Thanks for squeezing me into the 5 o'clock session. Life go fast, but anything for my favorite member. Why am I your favorite member? Oh, your candy bar cookies single-handedly keep me in business. - Hey, Delly. - Yeah? Who is that? I saw her at the bakery this morning. That's Ronni Ward. She moved to Lake Eden a few months ago and she has made quite an impression since then. So where is Brett? You didn't hear? He got fired. What happened? All right. Welcome back to spin class. - I tell you later. - Enough chit-chat. Grab your bikes and let's get started. Here we go. Let's have some fun. Whoo. That's right. Whoo. All right everybody. You're doing great. That's right. Now, let's kick it up a level. Push yourself. Get up over the pedals. You got this. Hey. Stop right there. Push yourself. I know you can do it. Three, two, one. Nice work. It's not over yet. We're gonna go again. I guess class is over. - We should call the police - I just want to go home. Ronni, after everything that has happened these past few weeks. I'll follow report in the morning. I'm just worried about you. I know. You stay here. Meow... - Oh, hi, sis. - Michelle. - Surprise. Well, thank you for understand, Mike. Yeah, no problem. Tell Michelle I say hi. Now, I do expect a rain check, though. Ok? Absolutely. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Sorry, I torpedoed your plans. I just didn't know you were coming. I Thought you were in Cairo. No, Cairo was last month. I was supposed to be in Milan shooting out fashion, But it got cancelled. So, I hopped on the red eye and... - And then broke into my house. - Well, the key was under the mat. Hey, was this date supposed to have wine, or... - It's in the fridge. - Excellent. - How long are you staying? - Just a couple of days. You have room for houseguests? - You want to stay here. - I can't stay with Mom again. Last spring I was home for literally two days before she tried to set me up with the mailman. Yeah, but two days it's actually a lot of restraint for mother. I always knew she liked you best. - Please. - Of course you can stay. Thank you. Hey, congratulations by the way. - Did Mike pick this out? - Yeah. Oh, he has good taste. Are you wearing my bunny slippers? Oh. Slow down a little bit. - Everything OK? - Yes I'm fine. I just... I just wasn't paying attention to where I was going. OK. All right. So, just slow down a little bit. - Good night. - Thanks. Good night. If you'd like to leave your business card we have a weekly cupcake raffle. You know, I think you should get married somewhere tropical. That way you can get hitched and I can get a tam. It's a win-win. I always pictured a small ceremony. A few friends and family. Something maybe in the backyard. You wanna have a backyard wedding? Mom would lose her mind. I love it - Good morning. - Hey, do you think if I sit really still, she will notice that I'm here? She's our mother, not a velociraptor. Well... Oh, there she is. - My baby girl. Come here. - Hi, Mom. Oh, my goodness. Let me look at you. Oh, let me do just a little hairspray. Right there. It has been so long. Tell me, what is new? You mean, besides all the tattoos? That's just a joke. I see you still have your father's sense of humor. So, what brings you to town? Michelle wouldn't miss your big debut, Mother. - Not in a million years. - Oh, Michelle. Well, it is going to be the social event of the year. You could take pictures. Did you bring your camera? I did, it's with my luggage at Hanna's. Oh. Well, then we will just go and grab our things. I've already got fresh linen in the guest room and we will get you all settled in. Come on. You know, I would love to, but, Hannah actually insisted that I stay with her. Sisterly bonding. Right? But I have to inventory tonight, late. So... You can have Michelle all to yourself, all day. That's wonderful. There are so many people who are going to want to see you. Come on, grab your coat. Tell me is there anyone special in your life? - Hi. - Really sorry to be bothering you miss. There's a possible break-in at the flower shop. I'm talking to nearby businesses to see if they've seen or heard anything suspicious. Nearby businesses? That flower shop is blocks away from here. Well, just being thorough. Thank you. - Want some coffee? - Always. Mike, another break-in? Yeah, they tripped the alarm. Didn't notice anything stolen. So, it could be nothing. Do you think that I should get better security for the bakery? I think that's a very good idea, yeah. Right. Mike, shall I heat up a cinnamon bun for you, - Or, I don't know, something else? - No, I gotta go. I still have some people I gotta talk to. People who actually live near the flower shop. People who actually live near the flower shop. Yeah, exactly. Bye. Thanks for this. Open and ate them. What? Why? Why you waking me up? - Yeah. It's 4 o'clock. - Four in the morning? Time to get up. Time for some sisterly bonding. - No, no... - Come on. - No, no... - Yeah. No, no, no, thank you... I'm just gonna wait in the car. Oh. How can you work out those early? I'm on baker's hours. - Where's everyone? - In bed. No. There's usually someone at the desk. Hello? - Marco? - He obviously just stepped away. Well... Yeah. So, what do you want to do first, treadmill? Hot tub. Michelle, hot tub is this way. Oh, sorry, we... Michelle, call 9-1-1. You okay? Hey. - Are you ok? Are you hurt? - I'm fine. - You're sure? - Mm-hm. What happened? It was Ronni Ward, the spin instructor. She was just floating there dead. I didn't know anyone was here. I didn't see her car in the parking lot. OK. What did you do next? We just went and found the security guard. he was doing his rounds and he called it in. - Okay. Ted, yeah. - Yeah. - Good. I'm glad you're okay. You're can be alright getting home? Yeah. Um, my sister is here with me. - Michelle. - Hey. - Hey, good to see you. Yeah. I wish it was under better circumstances. - You ready to go home? - Yeah. - Ok, see ya. - OK. See you later. - Detective. - Yeah? Ronni's car was vandalized last night. She wouldn't call the police, but - I kept this. Just in case. - Excellent. All right, take me through everything that you saw. - Take it. - Oh, thank you. Oh, Hannah, your ring. Okay. Whoa, whoa, Hannah. You can't go back in there, It's an active crime scene. But, Sheriff, I left my watch and my engagment ring in the lock room. - I'll grab it for you. - Oh, thank you. We'll just wait right here, then? Drop by the station. I'll have it for you there. Okay Sheriff, do you mind not saying anything to Mike about this? I don't want to worry him and he's got a lot on his plate right now. Great. - Thank you. I owe you. - Blueberry crunch cookies? You bet. I will bring them by the station. Awesome. See you. We're just trying to establish a timeline for the day to see who she might have interacted with. So, I can't believe you knew her. I mean, does she was your neighbor? Do you have any idea who could have sendered the cookies that we found in her locker? Who could have bought them? Well, I know it wasn't Ronni. She didn't buy them herself. A box of chocolate chip? I mean, it's the most popular order. - I figured it was a bit of a long shot. - Yeah. Where's your ring? Um... I take it off when I'm baking. I don't want it to end up in a pie. So, how do you feel about the Fairmount, for the wedding? The country club? Isn't that a little outside our price range? It may work It's so beautiful. I mean, the views are so spectacular it holds - 300 People. - Three hundred? Yeah. I mean, more if we hold it out in the gardens. And I talked to the owner, and I got us a tour next week. Great. Wow. Okay. Yeah. - I'll let you get back to work. - Okay. Don't mind me, just pretend I'm not here. Hmm... Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Don't you have something to frost? Yeah, the coroner's preliminary report estimates the time of death between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning. Were they able to get any physical evidence on the body? Yeah, the ME confirmed that the ligature marks on her neck didn't match the resistance band that they found in the hot tub, but the chlorine in the hot tub removed any touch DNA completely. Maybe the perp put her body in the water on purpose. - What about the spray paint can? - Clean as a whistle. Mike, I call in the Bureau. What? Until those budget increases are approved we're working on skeleton crew. You know, you get to have a partner on this. What are you talking about? The last thing that I need is to have some pencil pusher from the CBA looking over my shoulder every five seconds. Mike, I'd like to introduce you to Stella Parks. Hey, um... - Miss Parks. - Agent Parks. It's a pleasure to meet you, Detective. - I look forward to working together. - See there? Already you have off to a great start. - Can I get you some sugar? - Hm-mm... That'd be nice. - Cream too, or...? - Yeah. The Sheriff still hasn't gotten back to me about my ring. How much longer on the pecan, Sandy? Three minutes. Good. What are you reading? Your mother's book. Have you read it yet? - No. Not yet. - Ah, it's a real page turner. Well, you know my mother. She definitely has a flair for the dramatic. Oh, Hannah. How could you? I'd wish you are better than that. Better than what, Mother? You know exactly what I mean. You found another body. And just days before my book launch. I'm so sorry, Mother. It must be terrible for you. Yes. But I have no choice but to persevere. Oh. Lisa. So, what do you think? And don't hold back, I wanna hear it all. The good and the bad. Oh, it's fun. Carnivals are fun, dear. This is literature. Oh, well, um... I really like the romance. - I'm team Nathaniel. - Aren't we all? Oh. I'm having an epiphany right now on the Dessert Menu. What would you think about miniature cream puffs? - Great idea, Mother. - Thank you. It suddenly occurred to me. Hey, Lisa, what are these? Oh, I pulled the receipt checks you asked for the chocolate chip cookie boxes. Oh, great. Thank you. Perfect. Mr. Fields, get a sec? Got a couple questions about Ronni Ward. How long has she been working at Heavenly Bodies? Almost four months. And was she well liked? Depends on who you ask. Ronni could be divisive. Yeah. I asked that because her car was vandalized recently. And I know she didn't file a police report. Do you have any idea why? No, I don't know. You know, I encorage her to, but... I think maybe she might have been embarrassed. What was your relationship with Miss Ward? She was a frien... uh, an employee. A friend. So, strictly professional. Yeah. And where were you last night? I was visiting my sister in Maple Grove. - For the whole night? - Yeah. I just got back to town this morning. OK. That's all we got for now. If we have more questions we'll be in touch. I have one more question. Was it usual to have a single staff member on an overnight shift? Uh, no. No, usually we have two. One on the desk and one on the floor. And who was scheduled for that night? I was. I couldn't get coverage, but Ronni assured me that she could handle it all by herself. So, the trip to visit your sister was a last-minute decision. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for your time, we'll be in touch. I'll call the sister and see if the story checks out. When it comes to a family member in trouble memories tend to get fuzzy. We'll need footage on the tolls. He would go through at least two before he hit Maple Grove. And we'll need employ files, background checks, customer complaints. - I'm on it. - Great. While you do that, I'm gonna grab some lunch. You don't need me looking over your shoulder. OK. So, this is a list of all the people who bought chocolate chip cookie boxes in the last three days. With a credit card. Through a dozen more with cash. Ok. We can't worry about that right now. Margot Ross bought some for her mother. Trina Copeland was for a birthday party, I think. And then... Well, Mark Shields he buys a dozen every monday. So, that's seven unaccounted for. So, how do you figure out who bought the box for Ronni? We could... I have an idea. Congratulations sir, you have won our weekly cupcake raffle. But to clean your prize, you're going to need to participate in a short survey about your past purchases. Well, there's only one name left. Good thing too, because we are out of cupcakes. May I help you? Hi. I'm not sure I really have the right house. I'm looking for Steven Grant. Steven went out of town. - And you are? - Jacqueline, his wife. Right. - When did he leave? - This morning. What is this in regards to? Your husband won our weekly cupcake drawing. We're not interested. But I just need to speak to him for a minute. If you don't mind sharing where he is or how I could reach him... Oh, hey, little guy. Where are you off to? Hi, sweetie. What? Did you make a jail break? - Oh, yeah. - Scooter. Hey, here, boy. - Oh, my gosh. - Norman. - Thank you, so much. - Hi. Stop to tie my shoe. he saw his opportunity and... Boom! When did you get a dog? A couple weeks ago. Margaret Beeman, her dog had a litter puppies and I got Scooter here. A couple weeks ago? I uh... I hadn't realized it had been that long since we talked. Yeah, well, I mean... You've been busy, right? Planning your wedding and everything else. Right. But I do believe you are due for a cleaning. So, you will have to pencil me in at some point. OK. Absolutely. Put it on the calendar. Okay. - I'm gonna get this little monster home. - Oh, yeah. I'll see you. Norman, you should come by the bakery. My mom's book reading is tonight and We're selling pop cones now and I bet Scooter would love one. In fact, the first one is on me. All right. I'll keep that in mind. See ya. All right. Bye. Bye Scooter. Oh, Sheriff. Blueberry crunch cookies, as promised. Yes. Help yourself. - Oh, get your watch here. - Oh, great. Sorry we haven't found your ring yet. But we'll keep looking. - Is Mike in? - Office. Right. Thank you. You are not going to believe what I found out about the Ronni working. Hi I was looking for Mike, um, detective Kingston. He stepped out for a moment. Well, I'm Hannah, his fiancee. Stella Parks, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Wow, how do you fit all that on a business card? - Hey. - Hi. It seems that your fiancee has made a break in the Ward case. Oh, well I just found out who bought the cookies for Ronni Ward. It's a guy named Steven Grant. He works at Sunset Reality Alpha Beam. - You didn't talk to him did you? - No, of course not. I talked to his wife. The day before Ronni's murder she and Jacqueline Grant got in a big dust up at the bakery. - Oh, yeah? About what? - Well, I Don't know for sure, but I would think it had something to do with the fact that her husband was buying Ronni gifts. Do you do this often? Involve yourself in his criminal investigations? - I wouldn't say often. - No. And just what is your area of expertise? I'm a baker. I can't believe it. The murder bumped my interview right off the front page. What is this world coming through? It's buried under the classifieds, Hannah. Nobody reads past the crossword. Your dresses just came in this morning. Oh, they're absolutely lovely. I can't wait to see them on you. - Dressing rooms are right over there. - Thank you. Yes. So, bring up the shoulders like this and then the fabric is just bunching just a little bit here at the seam. Well, I'm happy to make all those alterations, but - you'll have to purchase the dress. - I'm planning on it. Mother, what are you gonna do with a Regency dress? Fashion is cyclical. Wait long enough and everything comes back in style. - It's been 200 years. - Hannah? Oh, a rental is fine for me. Thanks. - Are you sure, honey? - Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Uh, Carol what do you have that will work for Michelle? Oh, no, no, no, no. I do not need a dress. Sweetheart, everyone will be in costume. You'll stick out like a sore thumb. - I may have something in the rack. - Oh, goody. So, let's see here. Everyone is just so excited about your Mother's novel. Must be specially exciting for you, Hannah. Why is that? Carol, what are your suggestions for accessories? - Oh, excuse me. - I love it. What do you think that was about? Have you read mom's new book? - I'm surprised that you have. - I read it on the plane. It's surprisingly not bad. Been overwritten in parts, but... So what does that have to do with... Hannah... Look at this. Stop. Honey... What do you think? Uh... It's a bit much. Sweetheart, it's your wedding day. There's no such thing as too much. Would you like to try it on? - I don't think the... - Yes. Well, I would love to see that. Maybe some other time. Well, when you're ready to start your search, we're here. - When is your wedding date? - Yes, Hannah. When is your wedding date? Yes, Ronni and I had words at the bakery. I thought she had crossed the line. What did she do exactly? My husband and I both got memberships to Heavenly Bodies. We wanted to make a positive change in the new year. Suddenly Stephen was going multiple times a week. I hardly saw him. And then I found out he'd been giving Ronni Ward rides to work. And money. Clearly she was using him. Were you aware that her car was recently vandalized? I was not. What are these? I restore old jewelry. It's a hobby. They're beautiful. I mostly do it for friends and family. I feel most things can be saved with a little effort. I know I lost my temper detective. But I only said to Ronni what half the women in this town wish they had the guts to say. Delores, I'll do my best to have those alterations done by friday. Thank you. Oh, Michelle. Look. Lolly's Fashion Lounge. I'm sorry, the soonest opening I have is next Sunday. I'm afraid it's the best I can do. Okay. All right. I'll see you then. Okay. Seems like you could use a hand. I've really been stretched thin with the party. Why? Do you know anyone who might be interested? Sue Plodnik, my friend Delly's Mom. She's looking for a reason to get out of the house and be around people. Well, that's certainly in the job description. - Perfect. - I used to have a help wanted sign up, but it wasn't attracting the right candidates. The last one asked if she could be paid under the table. Who was the applicant? Ronni Ward. She was very cagey about her past. Doesn't give me references or agree to a background check. I got the impression she was hiding something. Just came in. Take a look. - Who's Veronica Hoffman? - Our victim. Apparently Ward was her maiden name. She was married? She lived next door to you, she ever mention a husband? No No, our conversations were usually just small talk in the mail room, but Never came up in any interviews either. I think she may have been hiding it for a reason. - Find anything? - Uh, 77 cents and a bunch of hair ties. Let's keep looking. I just don't understand it. I mean, where could my ring be? I hate to be the wet blanket here, but maybe it was stolen. You did say that Mike has been dealing with thefts in town. No. I can't even think like that. Um... Will you just stand guard for a second? - There's nothing here. - Why would you ring be in a filing cabinet? No. I'm looking for Ronni's employment file. But there's nothing. I mean it just doesn't make sense. No background check, no tax forms. So, Ronni was working off the books. Maybe Marco was more accommodating than the dress shop. But why was it so important to her not to leave a paper trail? Maybe she wasn't looking for anything permanent. Maybe someone was looking for her. Let's go. Good evening. I'm just so thrilled to have you all here. Thank you everyone for coming tonight. I am so excited to share with you just a few passages from my debut novel, A Match for Anna. Shall we? As the carriage approached the Reid's Estate, Anna was nervous. Nathaniel Reids was a man of reasonable character and pleasant demeanor. A more than suitable match for young Anna. But Anna has had been turned by the roguish Mr. Kingstone. Must to her mother's great disappointment. Poor Anna's brow furrowed. Who to choose? Her mother? Or the rogue that would ruin her life forever? But we shall find out, shan't we? - Thank you. - Thank you. Isn't dreamy? Your mother gave me an advanced copy. - Wow. - I loved it. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You too? - Yeah. Wow. Ready to get home? Brett. I took your friday night spin class. Right, right, um... Hannah. Yeah. And I'm sorry I don't see you at the gym anymore. Yeah... Rather not get into it. He's offering private sessions if you're interested. Yeah. I would be. Thank you. - Oh. Yeah. - Okay. Great. Thanks. See you at the gym, Caty. Well, I for one... I'm looking forward to reading the rest. Norman, I have no idea. I know, I know, I know... It's your mother, she's uh... - There are no words. - Yes. Well, I got go. I'm double parked and I'm getting towed. - Wait, really? - No. No, but that is the lie I told your Mother and I'm sticking to it. You know, she was asking me to pose for pictures with the book. - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. Hannah... An errand means picking up a gallon of milk. Not skulking around a junkyard. Mike said that Ronni's car was towed the morning of the murder. That means if the car is still in this impound lot, she had to get a ride to the gym that night. - So... - There's a potential witness out there who hasn't come forward. Well, they're closed. Looks like you'll just have to come back tomorrow. We can fit through there. Hold that, hold that. Let me get this straight. You were gonna sneak into a junkyard illegally, in the middle of the night, on a hunch that you might find a dead woman's vehicle? Yes. Oh, I am so in. Well, I most certainly am not in. - Suit yourself mother. - We'll be right back. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I am not going in there. Oh, Hannah. You make my Saturday bridge club so difficult. Christine Khan is lending me her gorgeous home for the gala. But you started asking awkward questions about this dreadful business. So, I had to artfully change the topic. So, what are we looking for here? A silver car with purple graffiti. Oh, really? Oh, honestly Hannah. Was something that I did? Did I give you too much affection as a child? Did I simply care too much? You would tell me wouldn't you? How could you write a book about my love life? That is absurd. Two men fighting for the affections of a flaxen haired beauty? My, my, don't we think highly of ourselves? You name the main character Anna Swanson. Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental. You're just... Hey. - Hey, this is it. - Are you sure? Pretty sure, look. So, do you, like, do this a lot? - Yes. - No. Maybe I should come home more often. You know, that is not even purple, Hannah. It is deep aubergine. I had the patio furniture spruced up with that same color. - Yeah, of course you had... - Oh, down, down, down. - The office is this way. - OK, OK. We can go. - I need help. - We got go. Oh. Stop it. - My shoes. - Okay. I'm sorry about your shoes. - Yes. Let's just get out of here. - Okay. - I wanna go home. - Do you have any idea? - Try to walk with these shoes. - Oh, mother. Okay, we can go on. Hannah. Surprisingly roomy in here. Although those walls could really use a little color. Oh, oh... Sir... Please, uh What time are the police notes getting delivered to the paper? Mother, you are handling this very well. Oh, honey. All publicity is good publicity. Mike. Hi. Trespassing, huh? Thank you. Anytime. Not that there has to be another time. I just don't understand how agent Parks got there so fast. I wasn't responding to a call. Yeah, we were following up on Ronni's Car. You're very luck, Miss Swenson. If were up to me, you'd be spending the night in a jail cell. Mike, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble. I just got this idea in my head and I had to see it for myself. You got good instincts, you should follow them. Well, I did pick you. Did I say good instincts? Because I meant great instincts. - Good night. - Mm-hm. What? No? What, what? What's wrong with it? - They're a little dry. - Dry? Trash them. Trash. Trash. Don't look me like that. You're a genius. Hold down the fort. I'll be right back. Okay. - Norman. Hi. - Hey. You just picking up some flowers for the bakery, or... Do you know Ronni Ward? No. I mean, not personally, no. But I heard what happened. That's so sad. The night that she died there was a bouquet of roses in the trash. Okay. And you're here to figure out where they're from? - It might be nothing - It might be something though, right? - Right. - Special occasion? - Oh, yeah. First date. I'm not sure if... Oh. Her name is Maisy, she's the new librarian. - That's great. That's uh... - Yeah. - That's good. - Can I help you? - Absolutely. - Yes. Who is first? - Well... - No, no, no. Go ahead. - Please, I insist. - Oh, thanks. For sure. I was wondering if I describe a bouquet to you could you tell me who purchased it? I'm sorry, I can't disclose that. Store policy. But if you're interested in flowers we are running a special on a number of arrangements and all purchases Come with a complimentary pen. Did you get a lot of repeat business with those? - Oh, quite a bit. - Huh. Wow. I was thinking about getting magnets for my shop. I own The Cookie Jar, the bakery down the road. Well, pens, always come in handy. You're right. Totally. So, about that purchase... I'm sorry... I wish I could help, but my hands are tied. Right. No. You know, I'm getting married. Soon. And I'm going to be placing a big order, I mean massive order of flowers. Where's you ring? We're having it resized. It was my grandmother's, so... Right. Yeah. Can I be honest with you, Craig? See the thing is Hannah's dear mother has a secret admirer. And we are just desperate to find out his identity so we might make a little love connection between the two of them before our special day, you know? So, I know it's against your policies this small favor would mean so much... It would mean a lot. What was the order? A dozen red roses purchased sometime on Wednesday. - That was a such great - All right? Yeah, anytime. Of course. You know, I meaning, Hanna. I know things have changed between us, but You're very important to me and if you ever need anything, you know, anything at all, just Say the word. I'm here. We did have an order for a dozen roses place that day. They paid in cash. When was the last time you saw your wife, Mr. Hoffman? - The night she left. - And when was that? Um Day after Christmas. I got her a set of high luggage and she decided to use it. She gave you any reason for leaving? Ronni was always impetuous. She humped and did things with little forethought or consideration of others. And you never made any attempt to contact her? She said she wanted space. I was trying to honor her request. I'd hoped for reconciliation. Can I see her? We can make arrangements. I just... I can't believe this is happening. Sorry. Where were you in the night of the 10th? I hope you're not suggesting I had any involvement. It's a very simple question, I'd like an answer. Where were you in the night of the 10th? I was home. In my bed. Can anyone confirm this? I think that's the last question I'll be answering without a lawyer. Sorry, Hannah. No ring. But I just got the OK from the police to reopen so, I'm bringing in a cleaning crew before I do. - I'll let you know if they find anything. - Thanks for keeping an eye out. Heavenly Bodies. No comment. Press has been hounding me non-stop. Looking for some angle on Ward's murder. Do you have any idea, who you think did it? Well, it would be irresponsible to accuse someone without proof. Right, of course. I'm sure you must have someone in mind. Brett Stevenson. The fitness instructor. He was harassing her at work. When Ronni told me, I fired him on the spot. - Harassing her how? - He was constantly asking her around. At one point Ronni thought he might even be following her. Brett has a girlfriend, though. Right? Isn't she a manager here? Yeah, Katie. She works administration downstairs She's a sweet girl, but when Ronni's car got tagged, she was the first person I thought of. - Ronni had her boyfriend fired, so... - Yeah. He was furious. Ted had to escort him out of the building. Look, sorry, Hannah. I promise I will let you know, the minute your ring turns up, OK? - Yeah, thank you - Okay. I thought I told you not to call me on this phone. You'll get your money. Any word on locating Stephen Grant? His travel plans check out. So, we'll interview him when he gets back. What you got there? Oh, it's a burglary from earlier in the week. Somebody stole the money from the Heavenly Bodies Rec Center fundraiser You need another set of eyes on it? No, I got it under control, thanks. Now, why did I know you were going to say that? I know your type. Solo act. You'd rather carry the whole load, than ask for help. It just um... It's just a little bit easier when I handle things myself. Is it? Okay, um... This is from four nights ago, here. I just got the tape. - You're thinking they're connected? - I'm not sure. What's he doing? He's punching in the code. Well, obviously it didn't work, if he had to resort to a crowbar. Yeah, but he thought it would. Which means he had inside information. So, if the thief worked there could've learn or have seen something that he wasn't supposed to? All right, ladies. Give me five more. Five. Four... Three more. Three. Two. - One more, ladies. - OK... Good job. Take some water. I really felt these last 10. Yeah, me too, you know? In the first 20. If you two have any friends with some fitness goals - tell them I'm the guy - Oh, thanks. Great. Have you been getting a lot of business? Not as much as I'd like. I can't believe the gym let you go. That makes two of us. Is it true that Ronni had you fired? - You're heard that? - Small town. So, is it true? That I was fired? Yes. The reason you probably heard why? No. So, you didn't make a pass at her? Look, maybe I was a little friendly, but... I'm a friendly guy. Wait, she wanted my classes. She was constantly begging Marco for more hours, and I had the best time slots. - She wanted me gone. - So, she lied. Work, didn't? What's made you angry. Okay, I see what you're trying to do here. - Trying to bait me into a confession. - Do you have something to confess? No The last day I saw Ronni Ward was my last day at Heavenly Bodies. I was happy to keep it that way. And now, every night she talks non-stop about the dress shop. It's really bright her spirits, Hannah. Thank you - Oh, I'm so glad that I could help. - Delly, half a dozen pistachio wings. - Thank you. - Thanks, Lisa What do you have here? Oh, a few of us from Ronni spin class are collecting money for a donation in her memory. - Would you like to contribute? - Of course. Um... Wow, that's really thoughtful. And look at that, it looks like you've gotten a great response. Yeah, it's really been wonderful. Her class helped a lot of us. She could be tough, but she got results. Yeah. I guess reputations aren't always fair. Ronni was a very private person. When you keep certain things to yourself, others start filling in the blanks on their own. Some look to Ronni and saw what they wanted to see, you know? Yeah. Yeah. - Let me get this out of your way. - Oh, thanks. - Your earring is a little loose. - Thank you. I got it from my aunt. I have them refurbished. Well, it's a really lovely color. Thank you, it's called a deep aubergine. Oh, if you have any old jewelry, you just need to give her a few dollars for the solvent and spray paint. Sorry, who did you say did the refurbishment? Fine, it was me. I spray-painted her car. I wanted to send her a message. Women like Ronni think they can have anything they want. But there's consequences. Like losing her life? I didn't hurt her. I just wanted to scare her. And I would do it again. "Are you a bridezilla? Take the quiz and find out." Let's do it. - Oh, don't you have somewhere else to be? - No. So, Mike told me that he wants to have a big wedding. Really? Doesn't really seem like his style. I know. I was surprised too. It's just that we feel like we're on different wavelengths lately and normally we're so in sync. It's been hard to get even a minute alone together. Well, you know what they say. When things get hectic, you just have to get creative. Hey. You are a sight for sore eyes. I wondered if I might be able to take you up on that rain check. What? That's perfect. I'm sorry it's not like more romantic in here. You were saying? So, you think that the theft and the murder might be connected. Maybe. The murder definitely feels more personal. Well, that takes back to Jacqueline Grant, right? - She tagged Ronni's car. - OK, no more shop talk. Now, we gotta get into something really important. First, have an olive. And secondly, the quest for the perfect cream puff. How's it going? Not great. I've tried four different recipes - and I just can't get it right. - Really? You're gonna have a breakthrough, I can feel it. I hope so. Hey, have you picked out an outfit yet, from my mother's Regency gala? - Yeah. Last week. - You did? You didn't tell me. What did you pick out? A costume? I mean, - I Hope it's a tailcoat. - I'm not going to tell you. You got to wait and see it. And it's awesome. Then you're going to love it. - Yeah. - I can't wait. - Hey, Hanna. - Mm-hm? When are you gonna tell me you lost your ring? - How...? - Detective. I didn't lose it. I really didn't lose it. I know exactly where I left it. It just happens to be in the middle of a crime scene. That crime scene. - Mike? - Yeah? You said that there was a box of chocolate chip cookies in Ronni's locker. Yeah. Those. Those are not chocolate chip cookies. Those are chocolate chip mega cookies. And that's somehow different? Yes. Yes, this is a completely different cookie. Can I borrow your phone? Yeah. Sure. - Because they look pretty similar. - They don't look similar at all. What are you talking about? Those are chunks. Chocolate chunks. Okay. Lisa, I'm gonna need you to pull up a whole bunch more receipts. Great class today everyone. See you next week. Hey, Brett. You got a sec? Really, the cops? Well, you told me that you hadn't talked to Ronni in weeks. What was I supposed to say? I saw her the night she was murdered. - How's that look? - Bad. - Yeah. So, why were you there? It's been tough, all right, since I lost my job. My bills are overdue, my landlord tried to evict me. I thought maybe if I pled my case, I could convince Ronni to get my job back. The cookies seemed like a good way to butter her up. - And did she agree? - No. She took the cookies and told me to get lost. What time was that? I don't know... Maybe nine. Marco said that she thought that you'd been following her. No, I wasn't the one following her. - Who was? - Some guy hanging around the gym. You know, asking all sorts of things. - What did he want? - He wanted to know where she spent her time, who with. - Did you tell him? - No, that guy gave me the creeps. And you're sure this is the guy that was following Ronni? Yeah, I saw him run a red light just to stay on her tail. What he look like? Average height. Not a lot of hair. Whore a hat. Drove a black car. Look, am I free to go? Yeah, thanks for your time. You know, I saw a guy that looked like that driving a black car in the parking lot at Heavenly Bodies the night that Ronni was killed. I think I may know who it belongs to. Two vehicles registered to Wade Hoffman. We've got a red Mercedes and a silver Lexus. No black car. Could have been a rental. He would were trying to be discreet. Brett mentioned that he ran a red light to stick with Ronni. Maybe one of your officers had an earlier encounter with the mystery man. On a traffic violation. I will check the last two months citations. Thanks. Roman Campbell Pulled over for speeding, 10 days ago. Are you sure this is our guy? Private Investigator, Wade Hoffman hired him. He tailed Ronni Ward for three weeks trying to get something incriminating for the divorce proceedings. And he told you all of this without a subpoena? Hoffman stick him on his bill. That'll do it. He find anything? - Is that... - Marco Fields. So much for "strictly professional". - That's not all. - There's more? Take a look at the time stamp. From the night of the murder. I already told you everything I know. Did you? - It's not what you think. - What do I think? We were involved, yes. But We were trying to keep it discreet. I was her boss. And Ronni still had to get through her divorce. You told us you were in Maple Grove. These photos put you in Lake Eden 30 minutes before the murder. I stopped into the gym to say goodbye. - Then what? - Then I left. I drove to my sister's just like I said. I swear. Ronni and Marco. And you think Marco did it? Well, he lied. Never a good barometer for innocence. These... are fantastic. Yeah, thank you. I finally cracked it. Yeah. You know, I knew you would. There's something about Brett's story that still bothers me. He was desperate to get his job back and then he just takes no for an answer? Well, I'm sure down played his reaction a little doesn't mean it ended in murder. Still, he's a super slime ball for hitting on one woman while he's dating another. He's seeing someone? Yeah. The manager of the Rec Center. Katie? That's her. - Where are you going? - I got to check on something. What? Hey, my mother's party is in a couple hours. Yeah. I will be there. I promise. Does Brett Stevenson ever visit you here at work? Brett? What does he have to do with this? I believe that Brett is the one that robbed the administration office. - What? - He lost his job he got into serious money trouble and... Yeah, I know Brett. He would never do anything like that. That's insane. Can I show you something? Okay. All right. - Honestly, I can't see much. - Okay. Let's come in a little closer. And right there, you see the suspect punching in the code to the safe. We changed the safe code every two weeks. So, only my boss and I know it. Okay, but has Brett ever been here in the office while you've opened the safe? Yeah... Oh, my gosh. Welcome. Thank you so much for coming. Welcome. - Oh, lovely to have you. - Thank you so much. Have you notice that we're the only ones dressed like we took a wrong turn at a Jane Austin convention? I'm trying not to think about it, actually. Don't... dishevel. Hello, hello... Oh, Norman. - Oh, you look fantastic. - So, do you. Oh, thank you, thank you. I played Bob Cratchit in last year's production of "A Christmas Carol", which is technically Victorian, I know this is Regency, but... Well, you're a lot closer than the rest of the guests. Right? Yes, funny as a lot of them are asking me to sign their books as well, but Oh, I wonder why that could be. Would you like to dance? I would love to. How was your date? Oh, it was nice. Yeah, she was um... - She was nice. - Did you invite her tonight? Uh... No, I don't think there's gonna be a second date. Why not? My heart just wasn't in it. Norman, we never talked after the engagement and, I... Hannah... Let me ask you something. Are you happy? Yeah. - I am. - It's all that matters. Truly. - May I cut in? - You did it. - Of course. I promisse I would. - Right. - Thank you for the dance. - Oh, thank you. - Norman. - Michael. - Nice ascot. - I believe they call this a cravat. - Ah. Well, it fits you. - Right? You're good. You're look so good. I love your hair like this. And though, even though my book is set in the Regency era, I really think that it says a lot about modern romance too. Oh, Michelle. Have you met Mr Jacobs? He owns a funeral home over on Western Avenue. Nope. Oh... She's just a little shy sometimes. Oh, darling, thank you. Our cream puffs are a hit. Oh, I'm so glad, mother. Great. Here you go. Hello? - Hannah we found your ring. - You have?... - You wanna come get it? - Yes. - Come over here. - Yes. I'm on my way right now. Thank you Will you let Mike know that I'll be right back. - Everything okay? - They found my ring. Oh, you gonna never be able to get your car from the valet. She's right. He's such a crush. You better take my car. Oh, darling, they're keeping it close by for my grand exit. Thank you, Mother. Ta-daa... Where was it? Clean crew found it out the lockers. It must have gotten kicked around. - Thank you so much. - Of course. I'm just glad I could deliver a little piece of mind. Oh, I just need you to sign the release form. It's policy. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Do you have a pen? - Here you go. - Yeah. Here you go. Thanks again. So, is that Catherine with a "C" or a "K"? Catherine... Love... - Hey. - Hi. - Oh, Mike I need... - Just one sec, sorry. Hey. Where'd you sneak off to? Mike, you need to get down to Heavenly Bodies right away. Because, I don't think that... Hannah? Hannah, can you hear me? Hannah? Yeah, I need a back up unit to Heavenly Body Rec Center. Get it there as soon as you can. I will be there ASAP. Yeah, Heavenly Body. Valet, this car out. Now. Hey. Hey hey, hey... OK. You have to understand I didn't mean for any of this to happen. Okay? I didn't even mean to hurt her. I'm a good guy. Okay? I am a good guy. You were in love with her? And you try to tell her, didn't you? You even brought her flowers. She turned you down, didn't she? She said she needed me. I did everything for her. Including giving her a ride to the gym that night. She told me she didn't want a relationship. And that it wasn't a good time to start something new. What happened? You... You saw her with Marco? And then, you threw her flowers in the trash. So, you waited until you knew she was alone. Then you follow her into the spa. Where you knew there are no cameras. It wasn't like that. I love her, okay? I didn't mean to harm her, it just happened. Once you realized what you had done, you you put her in the hot tub, - to try to erase the evidence. - Enough. Stop. Let me go. Let me go Tad, come on. No, no... Let me out right now. Tad. No. What are you doing, Tad? Tad... You can't do this. Tad, please. Tad, don't do this. Don't do this. Tad... Tad. Help! Help! Help! Tad.

I'll go check the north side of the building Hannah? Hannah. Help. Help. Help! If there's anybody out there, please, help me. Yeah. Find the security guard and detain him. Hannah. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can... Hannah. Got you. Got you. I got you. I got you. Hey, you're OK. You're OK,. - Mike. - Yeah. This dress was a rental. Hey, how are you gonna find Tad? We got him. Thanks to Mike's good instincts Tad didn't get out of the parking lot. - Listen, I gotta head to the station. I gotta process him, okay? - Yeah, of course. I can handle it. It looks like you're needed elsewhere. - Thank you. For all your help. - My pleasure. - Thank you. - Take care. Hannah, let's get you home. Come on. Oh, no. I have to go back to my mother's party. Hannah, you were almost killed. If I miss my mother's party she'll finish the job. - Oh, Hannah. - Mother. You know what? I'm not even gonna ask. Come dance with me. We should talk. - OK. Me first, okay? - Okay. - I need to apologize to you. - For what? I thought it wouldn't change anything. I mean, taking on all new responsibilities at work and putting them on the old responsibilities. - I thought that I could make it happen. - I told you that I understand. I'm just so used to do everything. Me, alone. And it's not just me anymore. Not anymore. OK, your turn. Hey. Is it that bad? I don't want a big wedding, like fancy caterers or an overpriced country club. And I don't even know 300 people. I only suggested all of that because I thought it was exactly what you wanted. - Why... - From the magazines, the fancy bridal magazine. With the little tabs on the end, all the pictures, and the people, and the things. That was from my mother. Delores? Would you care a dance? Mike, I just wanna to take our time and enjoy being engaged. - Is that okay? - Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. No rush. We'll do this at your pace.
