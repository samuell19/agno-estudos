I guess you're just old schools, y'know? Hey, listen, Tony, I got some, uh, I some some bro issues to kind of pass by you. Hey, Tony, what's up? Okay, we'll be ready. It's a problem with Shannon. Places everyone, hurry! I think it'd be okay, but I, I think Bill knows. Listen, after the, uh, surprise, you come see me, all right? I just wanna get your input on some things. Open the door, Dude! C'mon, Bill is almost here! Here, take this... C'mon, you'll ruin the surprise! It's not a costume party, Creep! Shannon? Shannon! C'mon, can't a guy just come home and not break his goddamn neck stepping on someone else' shoe in the fucking dark? Surprise! Serious, I mean, this was a shock! This is a, thank you so much, this was, have to catch my breath! Where's she at, where's, Shannon! Hey, c'mon, Babe, where are ya? Everyone's here, Shannon, where are you, what's goin' on? Oh, I know where she is, I'll bet she's gettin' all, uh, gettin' ready. Shannon, I'm comin' to get ya. I'm comin' to get ya! As I live and breathe, how you doin', you old shit? Old shit, are you wasted? Part of my process, Man, I'm workin' here! Working, is that what you call, uh, being out all night, losing your fucking keys again? I call that networking. Networking. Hey, you comin' to the show Saturday? No, I gotta go into work again. Tim! I've love to come to your show. Jesus, Tim! Even an old dog has to cut loose every once in a while! Yeah, yeah, the old dog gotta cut loose, well you know what, some old dogs are working! Some old dogs can't just leave work 'cause they're cuttin' half the staff. You know, if I don't go to work, I'm gonna get fired, do you know what that even means? You don't, 'cause you skate through life and, and, and, and, and, you know, piss around. Not everyone can do that! Tim, what is this? Careful, what are you doing? Stop it, quit, quit, you're ripping it! You're ripping. What is this? Ti-hi-hi-hi-im, Tim, Tim, Tim! I-I made it for Beverly. I wanted her to know how much I love her. She's the love of my life. Oh, well, in that case, I think maybe an engagement ring is a little more appropriate. I mean, this seems kind of childish. A ring, gimme this. A ring, a ring, ha! I live in the real world, huh? You don't just buy a ring, you-you make a scrapbook or something. Maybe if that goes well, you move in together, then you start to think about a ring, you know? You talk about it, (Muttering) you don't just buy a ring outta nowhere. Shut up! (Muttering) Was it something I said? Just leave the keys under the plant, can you do that? I'll leave the key wherever you want. Under the plant! And one more thing, the landlord called. What's up with him, how's he doin'? The lobby smells like weed, so knock it off, okay? Does that sound like something I would do, Tim? Smoke weed? Shit! Bev? Bev? Bev? Bev? Whoa, what are you doing? My God! It's just little old me, Tim! Oh my God, what the hell are you doing here? I could've stabbed you! There's a killer out there, y'know? I thought something happened to you, you don't answer your phone calls! I know, that's why I grabbed the scissors, somebody was following me, and then somebody broke into my house. Break in, look, you don't answer your phone. I worry about you, you, you don't answer your door. I worry about you, I was worried! I worry a lot, I want... Y-you mean the world to me. Oh, God, no, Tim. No, no, no-n-no, I can't. Tim, what the hell even is this? It's for your little trip! My little trip, Tim, that trip is the most important thing happening for me right now. I'm sorry, uh, I didn't mean it like that. I didn't mean it like that, it just that, do you remember that night we were in the rain.. Tim, what the hell are you talking about? You held my hand. What the hell are you talking about? It was raining. No, what are you, You remember! What are you talking about, Tim? I, we could, when you come back, you-you can move in, just like we talked about, uh, I'll kick Stuart out, just like we planned! Tim, I don't wanna lead you on anymore. Lead me on, I fucking love you, Bev! Tim! That night, we were in the rain. You held my hand, and, and you told me you wanted to be with me forever! Tim, it never rained! That was in your version! You've changed so much since then, you know it, and I know it. Tim, the key, I asked for it back a month ago. Just kidding.

I can't say slaughtering, I can't say butchering, I can't kick a bass player out of my band because he stinks! Help me! Uh, come on in, kill who you want! Help me, help me! Okay, so tomorrow, after the show, we, uh, you know, we, we tell Bill take a break, right? Like a, like an intervention. Like an intervention, I had one of those once, smokin' too much weed. Maybe, though, we should see what Ulton thinks about this. Maybe I should ask, I should ask Ulton about this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, see, hmm-hmm. That's where you and I disagree, Buddy. Why's Ulton the decider, we started this band! That's what I kept telling him last night, but he wouldn't listen. Saying when, what? Get the hell outta here, all right, or I'm calling the police, and you'll be put in jail, how's that, ha! The keys, Stuart, the goddang keys, huh, do you remember? Last night, you were supposed to leave the keys under the plant like we said. What are you doin', Man, did you... Come on, buzz me in! Lobby smells like weed again! I told him to knock it off! Can, uh, you do me a little favor, Man? Whoa, whoa! Get up, Man, get up! Okay, Buddy, so listen. Tim let me borrow his keys last night, all right, and I was supposed to leave them under the potted plant by the window, I totally forgot. He's gonna be pissed, he's comin' up here right now, he's super pissed, can you just handle this for me? If he sees you first, he'll calm down. He'll calm down, okay? I'm way to stoned for this right now. Just do this for me, please? Please, please, I'm so sorry, thank you so much. God! Open the door! Goddang head off, oh, Alex! Hey! I'm sorry, I, I had this crazy night and, and then. Hey, Buddy, I poured you a beer. I could use a drink. Yeah, I bet. After the night I've had. Can't you at least give me a fuckin' clean glass? I cleaned it. You're pathetic! Oh, did the scrapbook not go over well? You know what, as a matter of fact, the scrapbook probably went over pretty well! Yep, probably. Hey, Stuart, who the hell is Starfossils? Star, what? Ulton just posted this, like, completely different flyer for a different band name, I never got a text about this. Why didn't I know anything about this? You know Ulton, he and Bill last night, they kinda tried to kick us out of the band, and I, in turn, kicked them out 'cause it's our band. I invited a girl to this, a girl I met online, granted, but still, I mean, you're killin' me, man, shit! Are you texting Ulton, are you texting Bill? No, no, no! What are they saying, what emojis are they using? I've had enough of this shit, all right, I'm outta here, see ya. You're outta here, you're just leaving? That's it? Maybe Best Friends is still an option. Shit! He doesn't know anything about a scrapbook's edge, and I'm the guy that everyone knows does the best scrapbooks she wants. Now, that scrapbook, she loved my new scrapbook, and everybody knows, I make the best scrapbooks for all my girlfriends. I slept in a trash can, huh? I lost my wallet, my phone, huh? Huh? It's all your fault! My fault? Yeah, your fault, your carelessness, your screwin' around, all the time! You know what, I had a rough night, too. Oh, yeah? Yeah! Tell me about it, I'd love to hear it! Well, I woke up on the sidewalk with piss all over my pants. Oh! I couldn't retrace my steps, so I don't know where I left my keyboard, I don't know where I left my camera. I blew my chances with this babe named Roxy, who's probably the coolest girl I've ever met in my life. Ooh, the coolest girl. You know what, if this is about the rents, I call my 'rents and have them mail me the rents. The old dogs can still make a comeback here. It's not too late. This old dog thing, look, I don't think it's workin' for me anymore, okay? No. Yeah... Whatta you suggest? I wantcha out, okay? Out, out? Yeah, you hearing me? You hear what I'm saying? Que? I want you out of the apartment before I fucking snap! Don't! Well, is Beverly moving in? First you get the scrapbook, and then she moves into the apartment, and then you get a ring, right? And then you get mawwied and then you have little kids.. This isn't working for me anymore, okay? It's over, it's done! Little Tims and Beverelys Running around. It's over, I can't do this, okay? I can't. Can't do what? This, this is it. What, Tim, stop. This is, we're done! Calm down, calm down. You're outta here, get out of my apartment now! Get out of my apartment now! Get out of my ff, get out of my apartment, okay? You get out of my apartment now, all right? Get out of my apartment n-now! You little shit! Fine, I'll get out of the apartment.
