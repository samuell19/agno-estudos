After tonight, we say goodbye. Too sad. Not a bit, the public wants something nowadays to make them wipe their eyes and wish they'd done better by their old mothers. By Jove, you're right. That's a good idea. I'll start on it right away. See if you can get it ready in time to play for Mr. Schultz. Ready in the morning, madam. Laurie, I'm so so happy. Got 'em. Oh marvellous! - I'll tell you girls... - I shouldn't tell you a story like that, but you know it's awfully hard to get rid of a nice girl nowadays. Sure. I once had a girl in my company working for me for years. She used to bother the life out of me from morning till night, I'd made up my mind I was gonna get rid of her. So I said to her one day, "I got a nice surprise for you." She said, "Is that so?" And I made her the present of a beautiful jewel case. She opened up the jewel case and she said, "Why it's empty." I said, "Yes, that's the surprise." Darling, is your last dress silver, lilac or gold? Silver, what are you serious darling? Are you having a good time Mr. Kinkaid? Yes, thanks old man. Well you better take advantage of it because you may never get another chance. Ah. Back the winner of the gold cup Mr. Schultz? Well I find there's no such luck. I only one two races in my lifetime and one was from a policeman. I think it's heaven. Thank you man, this is fine too. I don't know about his songs, but water waving is too divine. I'm dying to see manager's friends. Or the manicurist she's a scream. Well lady I must say that there ain't really nothing new nowadays. I just came back from my holidays. I've been to Brighton this time for my holiday. I live by Mrs. Bloomberg. You know Mrs. Bloomberg? No. She calls her hotel The Palms. I looked around. I couldn't find no Palms, I said, "Mrs. Bloomberg", "why do you call your hotel The Palms?" She said, "Well when you go away", "the waiters will show them to you." Okay, what's the matter with that fellow that you're tangled up with? That barber of Seville, what's the idea? I hope he keeps better time with his music than he does with his appointments. Oh be quiet, he's on the way. Mr. Laurie and Grace. Here are you Laurie, I thought you would never come. - Good afternoon. - How do you do? - This is Laurie. - How do you do? I suppose you've almost given us up. Almost, well what should we call it? A close shave. Come on and have a cocktail. Grace, this is Mr. Schultz. How do you do Mr. Schultz? - So you file nails eh? - Yes. Well if your boyfriend don't write me some songs, I'll file my petition. Oh and here's some cocktails coming. Well cheers. Cheers. Haven't wasted much time have you? I'd rather not. Would you like to hear Laurie sing now? Yes, I'm ready. Gracie, won't you sing it? All right play up. Shh, shut up, I want to hear this song.

It was perfectly marvellous. Oh dearie. Have a seat and something to drink. All right I'll have a drink. Waiter, bring two martinis and I'll have a sandwich. Sit down now. Of course you know Oscar Schultz. Anyone who don't know Oscar Schultz don't know that Columbus discovered South Africa. Well go on say what you've got to say and get it off your chest. The song is all right but the way you sing it. How about appearing in my show? You'll be the greatest proposition in years. I'll pay you 15 pounds a week every week, but no commission. No, not even 15 pounds a week would tempt me. I like my meals regular. Oh, here Gracie have a drink. Thank you. What is that? Ham sir. Ham he brings me. My father all of a sudden should see me now. Take it away and bring me something else. What you want to think about Gracie is the money. Think what you could do about it. Silk stockings, silk camisoles, silk well I don't want to go too deep in the matter. Even silk bill slips wouldn't tempt me. Gracie, I'll make it 20 pounds a week. What is it this time? Bread and butter. Bread and butter he brings me take it away and put some hame in it. Now listen sweetheart, the more I think of you as a manicurist, the more I realise you are wasting your time. Yes, so are you. Come on Laurie. Come on Laurie, come on home. We can't go just yet. Besides it would be look bad. Yes so do you. I'm all right. I've been getting ideas. Yes, bad ones. Don't you see, that if I can only get a contract from Schultz to writer all Josie's numbers for his new show I shall make a name for myself. You're making one for yourself now, look at you. Come on Laurie, come on home. They've all heard your song. What's the good of staying here? Oh Laurie, be a dear and play that song over again would you? Oh, he can't he's taking me to the pictures. What? Oh of course. I thought you'd like to be interested in his song. - Oh do I only I... - It's quite all right. There's lots of time. What's the matter with you Gracie? Like you, something's coming to my head. - Are you coming? - When I choose and not before. Laurie, play that song again please. Yes, please. - Shall I? - Please. ♪ Don't say it again I'm only pretending ♪ No it doesn't go like that.

Nothing doing. Hi Oscar. Wait a minute, this is business. Gracie, I'll make it 35 pounds a week. I'll make it 40. ♪ Give me a Kiss I'll always remember ♪ ♪ After tonight, we say goodbye ♪ Oi, oi oi! Oh so you've managed to wake up at last have you? What's wrong? By the look of you I should say everything. What time did you get home this morning? Oh about half past three. You've got to be at work at nine o' clock. - Oh no I haven't. - Well what do you mean? No more hairdressing for me thank you. Why should I when I can make lots of money writing songs? Don't be a fool. You can't chuck up your job just because you've sold one song. One song? Why I'm gonna sell thousands. Who says so? That dyed hair stuck up lizard who calls herself an actress? You don't like Josie do you? I do not. And I like her less still for keeping you out till three in the morning. But I am not a child. I can take care of myself. Oh yes, look at you. Have you seen yourself in the glass? What? Well there's no reason to be saucy. You slept in your clothes all night last night. Well you better change that pin shirt before you catch a death of cold. I shan't ask you to the funeral. No, you won't be able to. Good morning girls. Good morning contessa. Good morning Delmonico. What marvellous manners his attendants have. I've only been here twice and he's remembered my face. Yes, there are some faces he never forgets. Oh dear hurry up Delmonico. I've got a rehearsal today and Schultz is always angry after a party. Have my apologies, they are all busy. I am distracted, but when you take away my most popular dresser from me. Oh Laurie is going to write all my songs for me. Oh I've no time to wait, but I'd love to have my nails done. I will send a lady to you. Where is that wretched Gracie? Two more times later and I'll give her the sack right away. Have you seen Gracie? No not today Delmonico? Have you? Where on Earth have you been? I've been waiting five minutes. Don't shout, I'm not deaf. Don't be impertinent. This is the result of treating you as an equal last night. Oh will you shut up? Don't you dare speak to me like that. A manicure please and a shampoo if there's time. Oh but you don't do that do you? No, but I will in this case. Oh sorry. Oh! This water is too hot. Nothing's too hot for you, sorry madam. Oh sorry madam. You're doing that on purpose. I shall report you to Delmonico. Oh report away, think it's all lucky you if you were let down lightly. I will attend to it myself counsellor. Why I... Quite all right, I'll do your hair wash for nothing. Did you call for Delmonico? Delmonico! This girl's gone raving mad. Please Josie, what has happened? Why she seized me, seized my head and just sprayed me all over. - Why I haven't! - What? I'll never enter this shop again. And you, what have you to say? Well I had to stop her talking somehow. You get out. What? You are dismissed, you understand? Too long I have tolerated your continual unpunctuality. This is the end. Hi? Go. And consider yourself lucky I don't send for a policeman and charge you with assault. Yes madam? Could I see the manageress of the beauty parlour? In through that door madam. Thank you. Of course I don't really want a manicure. I'm looking to see if there's a job going. Ah, this way milady. You're a bit swift aren't you? I must have my table Oscar. Well you've got it lovely. This place is too grand for me. Silly Billy, wait till I make you a real success. Come on let's do everything together. Come on I think we'll have a little bath and we'll put you to bed. Oh no, let's stay up instead. Instead? I'm going out with my boyfriend tonight. I have to be very beautiful. Oh really well how would madam like her hair done? Water wave, Marcel wave or permanent wave? I think I'll have a Marcel and permanent wave please. You'll have a permanent wave, well well I think we'll have a little washing first. Oh no. Oh yes, now what soap would madam prefer? Oh you're usual sir. Oh monkey then. Come on, get those off. There you are there you are madam, you'll find our baths are very good and highly recommended. You'll find them splendid for rheumatism. Oh they're wonderful for rheumatism. Dear oh dear where's the soap? Here it is then, there we are. Oh dear. How dare you put soap in my eyes. I shall tell the manager. Manager, come here please. This woman's put some soap in my eyes. I think you'd better give her the sack. Oh, what again? Did you hear what he said? You're dismissed. Dismissed. Here you are darling, it's all over. And now to bed. Oh no. Sing to me first. No, not tonight darling, I'm terribly tired. Just a little please, the one with Uncle Laurie.

Of course darling. Josie, sing this song as you've never sung before. Then old Schultz will have it in his new show and I shall be a big success and you'll be a big success and we can be together for good. Oh I shouldn't tell Schultz that part of it if I were you. Oh why not? Oh you know how men are. Oh stop worrying about your song and come and talk to me. Sip? Match? Ooh, I can see the flame reflected in your eyes. What fun. You make me feel like a flame. Ooh, what a lovely line for a song. Let's write lyrics together shall we? Being with you is like a lyric. Why, that's really poetry, lovely. You're lovely darling. I love you. Hey is that the title of the new song what you've brought me? No, I was having a private talk with Josie. So will I, you ain't the first one. But I don't understand. Mr. Schultz I think ought to tell you that Josie and I... Oh Laurie has brought you a new song, I like it. That don't mean a thing. What's the name of it? I Hate You.

Don't need to be rude, what do you want to do kiss you? Didn't I give you 100 pounds to write some songs for my new show and what have you done with it? Wasting my good money to take my actresses and others out instead of doing what you paid for. Why, I need inspiration. Well why don't you run around the park, you'll get all the perspiration that you need. Funny aren't you? No I ain't funny. I'm angry. I showed this song to Max Walters, do you know him? Do I know Max Walters? I knew him when he was only a blush on his mother's face. Besides, he ain't no judge of anything. Listen, the first two, three songs that you wrote for me, they wasn't so bad, especially with that girl, that what did you call it that Gracie woman. But since I gave you that money, you gave me nothing but rubbish. My songs aren't rubbish. Rubbish, rubbish I know it when I see it. Say you can't do nothing. You're nothing but a fake. But Oscar! Joy, listen let me tell you something young lady. Why do you hold yourself so cheap? That fellow thinks he can get you for a mere song. It's better than the lousy parts you give me anyway. Say say say I've heard that before. The next time you get tangled up with a fellow, make sure that he's a good songwriter first and a good hairdresser afterwards. How dare you talk to Josie like that. How dare 1? How dare 1? Well don't that take the cake. I'll show you what I'll dare do. I'll show you come around here and talk to me. Here, there is your contract Mr. Hairdresser. Now take it and get out. - But Mr. Schultz... - You ain't stone deaf are you, get out! Josie darling you like the song don't you? Which song my dear? The song you've just sung. You still like it don't you? Well it's very ordinary isn't it? Ordinary, I see. I think I understand. Goodbye. Do sit down, Gracie, you're looking terribly tired. Tired? You can believe me, the chap that wrote I'm happy when I'm hiking never spent a day out looking for a job. Did you get anything? Yeah, fresh air. Why don't you ask Delmonico to take you back? Oh, I can just imagine what he'd say. What me take you back? NO no no no no, you ruin the business, go away, go away, go away make with the scoot, make with the scoot. Look up look up look up look up, there you're all right now, now what were you trying to say love? Why don't you be a police lady like mommy? That child's full of ideas. Yes and bread and jam. Oh do be a police lady, you'll look so funny. Can you see me on my first day out? With all the kids following me? Ha, dogs and all. Can you see me in a baton and arms and a fireman's helmet? Come on lads, over here we go. Come on, over, over, come on, come on, don't look so dull, miss oi, stop, stop or I'll make you. May I have a word with you Gracie? You may quite likely we shall have several. Hello Uncle Laurie, are you really going to marry an actress? Now Betsy you're getting terse, it's time you were in bed, come along. - Oh no! - Yes it is time - you've been in bed. - Aunt Gracie... Come on along, I'm gonna put you to bed. - Oh no I want... - Yes I am. I want some grapes. You can't have the grapes, come along. My dolly. All right darling here it is, come on. And my rock! You want the police station that's what you want. Oh no I don't need to go to bed! Afraid I've made myself unpopular. Who with? I expected to find you alone. Yes, I generally am these days. Well, there's no charge for seats. It's a long time since we've seen each other. I was wondering whether you might like to that is I thought I'd ask you to sort of well you know. Well now you've managed to make yourself so clear what is it you do want? Well it's about this song. What about it? There's something wrong with it. What's it called? I Hate You. That's what's wrong with you. I feel it's good. And yet when I hear it, I... Who's been singing it, your friend Josie? It doesn't sound right when she sings it. Why not isn't she the greatest thing that ever happened? I am sorry. Yes, you've said that before. You've you've always helped me before Gracie and I thought perhaps you might. Yes Gracie's always helped you before and when you want something you come rushing back to Gracie thinking she'll help you again. And she does. Goodness knows why, because she's soft I suppose.

All right well close the lousy show for all I care. I will close the lousy, I will close the show. Did you ever see that damn telephone is ringing the whole day long, hello who is it? What does she want? What's her name? Grace? Grace? Tell her I won't see her. I only want to see my bank manager and even him I don't want to see. Oh! I understand you don't want to see me Mr. Schultz. That's quite right. Well here I am. In that case, I will see you, now what do you want? I want to talk to you about my friend Laurie. See I've got enough of that fellow for the rest of my lifetime. Well give him another chance. Not on your life. His stuff is rotten, he's a fake. His songs want singing. Listen, would you let me sing them for you? See, the more you laugh, the more I think that she is right. That's a great idea. It'll be a novelty and that's what the public want. What you mean you'll let me? Yes, I'll take a chance. Here, come sign your contract. Wait a minute, how much money do I get? 25 pounds a week. Are you being serious dear? Well whatever it is, it won't be for long. Your last offer was 40 pounds a week Mr. Schultz and that's what I want. 40 pounds a week, how do I know you're going to be worth 40? Well how do you know I'm going to be worth 25? That's right, I never thought of that. We'll make it 12. Ah, stop your messing, 40 pounds a week or nothing. All right, put your signature on this contract. That all right? Your word is sufficient. What are you gonna do with all that money Gracie? Shall I keep it for you? No thanks, I'm gonna give a big party to all my friends. Ah Gracie you'll have plenty parties. I'm gonna make you a big star. He once said that to me. Didn't I make you a star? Can I help it if you didn't twinkle? Gracie, tomorrow you come to see me in the theatre. We make you some beautiful gowns. You will look so swell that even your own mother wouldn't know you. I want you to go to the best hairdresser that you can find. Who will you go to huh? Delmonico's. Yes, that's right. Give him a surprise. Yes, can you see me with my head in the air walking into Delmonico's and him saying... You want me to take you back? No no no no, you ruin the business. Go away, go away. Make the scoot the make the scoot. You'll excuse me, but I want my hairdresser and a manicure. I seem to have been in this place before. Shall I go to the same cubicle? What would you like madam? Can I see the menu? Wave my hair please. Oh I beg your pardon I thought you said a manicure. I distinctly said a shampoo. Oh shampoo forgive me, I'm all mixed this morning. I know like cocktail. Madam's hair is coming out, my word. Madam's hair is coming out. Perhaps madam's worried about something. No, madam hasn't a worry in the world. I once had a client who quarrelled with the man she loved and it affected her hair to such an extent that it came out in hand fulls. Oh, well I've never been in love so that can't be the reason for my hair coming out. That's most peculiar, because it's an established fact that love makes people lose their hair. Yeah, it makes some people lose their heads. Yes, look what happened to Queen Elizabeth. Aye and Anne Boleyn. Oh careful about that. I beg your pardon, such a witty remark. When did you make up your mind you'd become a hairdresser again? When I discovered that I was a failure at writing songs. You're not a failure. I'm second rate and you know it. You're just a bit silly at times that's all. Well it may interest you to know that I've come to my senses now. This is a job I do understand. It may interest you to know that I'm going to be an actress and that's a job I don't understand. Are you serious? Quite. Laurie, why don't you snap out of it and be happy? I'm giving a party after the first night to all of our old friends Parker's Peace. Won't you come? No thanks, I don't go to parties anymore. So you're going into Schultz's new show? Yes, I'm singing three songs. Do I know the composer? You do well. Making a success of me in spite of myself I suppose. Don't you want to be a success? I want to be a success, but on my own. Yes, that's very noble, but you'll find every successful man has a woman somewhere around the corner. Laurie, you're cheating yourself out of success. Well if it's only myself I'm cheating it's all right I suppose. It isn't only yourself my dear. Well, go on. I know what you're going to say. Your success is my success or something equally wrong. I'd like someone else to do my hair please.

Gracie, that comic song is another big hit. Did Laurie write that? Who else? Why that crazy hairdresser, he's a genius, where is he? I want to make his fortune. He's going to write all the songs for our new show and you're going to sing them. - I'm going to find him now. - But don't go away. Ladies and gentleman together. From my heart, I ask you what can a fellow say on such an auspicious occasion? Your warmth makes me want to give a speech. I'm too full for words tonight. Of course Gracie's big success tonight has made me historical. I don't want to make a speech no more tonight. I think we ought to have Gracie to say it. - Give her a chance. - Yeah, give us a chance. Boys and girls, before I make a speech, I would like to mention that this party has become such a large one on account of Mr. Schultz bringing all his friends, that I am going to ask him to pay for the lot. Tonight tonight I feel like Cinderella. No more manicuring, no more sneaking around corners in a pair of number nines and a fireman's helmet. - I'm finished with all that. - Yeah, good luck to you girl. A fairy waved her wand and here I am at the party. How many other girls can boast of such good luck? Probably the only happiness is they have is being in love with someone. But look at me, I've got what I wanted, success. I can have beautiful clothes and lots of money. - Of course you can. - Everything I wish for. So what do I care about love? I'm perfectly happy. Can't you see how happy I am? Listen, Laurie's first tune, dance all of you, dance! Go on, dance, I'm happy. I'm perfectly happy, dance everybody dance. Let me see you dance, come on dance all of you come on.
