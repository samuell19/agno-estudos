THE CARBONARY It's time for the Romans to go to bed. - Soldier! - On orders, Captain. Everyone should go to bed when the shot goes off. Sentinel! Why aren't you at your post? - Prepare the cannon. - Yes, Captain! Curfew! Curfew! Curfew! Curfew! Fire! Tell me sir if this is a serious city. They say: "By firing the cannon, everyone in Rome to bed." But tonight, the theaters are open... and there is a ball at the Embassy of Austria, Russia, ... at Villa Torlonia. So who should go to sleep? The people. But they would go anyway. Where could they go at night? But I'm already at fault, how do I get home? - They can arrest me! - No, no! No, they are tight. You are not a shoemaker, my dear Raven. - You're just a shoemaker. - It's just that you have a large plant, ... Excellence, and want sneakers. And he says he has long fingers, ... but they are always toes. What can I do? - Come on, take them off. - Here it is. Too bad, they make you a little foot ... - Walk, take them off. - All right, I'll redo them. - What will you do tonight, Colonel? - I do not know, ... he had thought of skipping over to the Count of Monforte's ball. - It's the lowest dance ever. - What do you know? I made more socks than new shoes. You, instead, with a shoe like that, would look like a gentleman. I can't dance with these, they're like a press. Well, you can sit and talk to the old ladies, ... - No one obliges you... - Colonel, ... Do you really believe in the revolution? Well, there really was an attempt. There were a few young people who protested... against an aristocratic marriage. Four shots under the Piombino palace, ... - and who did they kill? - The bride? Nein. The doorman who was supposed to close the gate. It's always like that. However, the fact speaks clearly. - At cannon fire, everyone to bed. - I'd even go without him. And you, Captain, what do you intend to do tonight? Me? Lots of discipline. I'm going to sleep. But I don't close my eyes all night. - The boy cries. - Oh, by the way, I forgot, ... - congratulations for the happy event. - Thank you very much. But, what's up, you didn't have a child? Well, it was his wife who had it. - And he... no? - All Rome knows, Excellency. Colonel, Prince Dom Filippo Spada asks to speak to you. Oh, fine, I'll be right back. Excuse me, Captain. There's another one that can walk, after the cannon fire. Of course, it's Prince. Sorry, but why are you coming after me? Well, if I go out, they arrest me and I come back here. So since I'm here,... I surrender. By the way, if you give me the keys, ... I find myself a free cell. - I wish there was. - They're full, huh? It was also written in the last "Pasquinato". - "Where are our dear Romans?" - "Where?" "They're all in SÃ£o Pedro, arrested." - Of course this Pasquin... - But if I catch him... All right, wait for me here and I'll follow you later. Thank you, Excellency. God bless you. Excuse the question, but will you be performing at the ball with the entire patrol? But who told you I'm going to the ball? Things change in life, and I changed my mind. - And where are you going? - I'll make a round. And if I feel like walking, do I have to give you an account? - Well, in a sense, yes! - Huh? Are you walking comfortably? - Sure, they're old boots. - And who made them? - You! - Saw? - Do not trust. - Oh, I, not even my mother, ... even without ever having met her. - But why? - Huh? These people are disingenuous. Do you think they went to bed? They burrow like wolves but pretend to sleep. Here in Rome, the only ones who sleep are us, ... that we are always awake. But they don't! They are there, behind the windows, ready, ... with open eyes and alert ears. But there aren't even rats there, Your Excellency. Never trust! What was I saying, Crow? The people pretend to sleep. But your voice has been that stone talker for four centuries. Always him, Pasquin. - And when he talks, it's always a bad sign. - And what does he say? What it says? Take it. I cannot read, Excellency. Thank God I can't read or write. Read it out loud. Ah, very well, so we listen too. Because I, in the dark, ... I see little. I am also without glasses. What does it say, what does it say? So, say: "Vengeful priests. Napoleon has fallen." "Do you know why? Because it didn't kill you!" "Twice have already fallen, with no result". "But lost, a third ray will solve everything." - Pretty, no? - And what does this one do, laugh? See which Pasquin refers to you. With me? And what do I have with it? - Aren't you a priest? - Yes but ... Pasquin is against whoever is in charge. The government. - And whose government is it? - Of the Fathers, whose would it be? But who commands in Rome? Me or the foreman... Colonel Nardoni, present here? He commands, ... but he takes orders from the Monsignor Governor. And Monsignor Governor, what is he? - It's Father, what could it be? - It's Father. But I don't take orders from him. What does it matter to me? I am a priest, ... but if I don't take orders from the Government, I don't command. - So Pasquin... - Protests against him. - Clear! - Hey, Colonel, the protest is with you. Raven, but you didn't make it home? Yes sir, I live over there, right around the corner. So go, what are you waiting for? Now! You come with me. But what are you going to do? Are you going to shoot him? Is playing? Go waiting. In Rome there is Canon Law ... that establishes the holiness of the Father and of all his things. I'll give you an example: If you are a priest and your watch is stolen, ... it is sacrilegious theft. Imagine if they would shoot you! So I, when I grow up, will become a priest. And I hit you while there's time. So, these, against whom do they protest, according to you? Huh? Let's hear it, who are they protesting against? They protest against you. Ah yes? So, gentlemen, I'm going to give you some bad news. The attempted rebellion that is spreading through Rome tonight... it's against us. The Fathers are us. And can you also say Mass? This you can ask him to explain. He explain? I don't think so. Patrol! In front of. - What's up, is he offended? - What do I know, ... what is written here? It says "Death to the Government. Infamous Fathers." So he's right. It says "Death to the Government". - But whose government? - Infamous priests. - But it's not enough, son. It is unclear. - It is unclear? - It is unclear. Let's go. - It is unclear! - Oh, isn't that clear? - It is unclear. Saw? You don't even understand this innocent. - Whose government? - It is unclear. It is unclear! DEATH TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE INFAMOUS FATHERS It is now clear. May the Eternal bless and protect you, ... let the light of his face shine upon you... and grant him grace. May the Eternal turn his face towards you... and grant him peace. And so, here we have two souls saved from racial persecution. This week, five more creatures from the people of Judah... they were kidnapped by Christians and forcibly baptized. Therefore, take refuge in your parents' law. Marry as soon as age permits, but marry each other. Don't mix. Imagine that a woman of the Hebrew race... - live with a Christian. - Ah, here we come to a personal case. - It was an example. - But it's always the same, find another one. Make these speeches in front of the children... Well, but these can hear now. They are husband and wife. But if she and I marry, we are sinning. Hey, we're in the house of the Lord. What is this lack of respect? Put on the hat. I told Giuditta, deny Abraham's faith and it's settled. And why don't you deny Christ? What, are you crazy? You sold it for 30 coins, ... but for me it was worth more. Have you seen Dr Montanari? And you come looking for him here? Is he Jewish like us? Well, a doctor doesn't look at the race. Go where you must go. - Is anyone down here? - No, but there are a lot of little boys,... and even if for you they are for getting married, ... where little boys are, especially at night, ... turns, turns, and always Dr. Montanari appears. Not seen, huh? And him, who gave the smallpox injection? But what do you want? What are you saying? - Didn't you read the Pope's Edict? - And you, since when did you learn to read? I was lying in St. Peter's Square when the Pope... banned vaccination because the doctor who invented it was a Jacobin. And therefore, His Holiness said it's the Devil's thing. - But do you also believe? - I do not. But if you don't tell me right away where Dr. Montanari is, ... I'm calling Colonel Nardoni. - What do you want from Montanari? - It's not women's stuff. Then? I'm going? - They're plotting. - Yes, no one knows that. But where? It's in danger. Someone needs to warn you, no? Trust. It's a pity, but it's good. They are in the cellar, under the Marcello theatre. Sorry for the inconvenience. And you, hurry back home, because the cannon blew long ago. And you, to bed. By now, the little boys should be in bed, no? Come on, let's marry two more. Well, don't you help me? Solve it sir, it's late. We are all? Almost all. Only Filippo Spada is left. Excused absence. The daughter is bedridden with smallpox. Is the newbie here? It's there. It arrived yesterday from the Grand Duchy of Modena. Greetings and brotherhood. - Angelo Targhini. - Leonida Montanari. Did you swear on the skull to respect the laws of Carbonaria? He swore. And passed the test of courage? For this we expected you, since you are a surgeon, ... and have a steady hand. Place your hand on the table and spread your fingers. But be careful, if you withdraw it or get scared... means it's a coward... and will not be admitted. You laugh, huh? It wasn't him who moved, it was me who made a mistake. - It's admitted. - Well, go to hell. But what does he say, curses? - And now, who will it be? - Whoever it is, his bad luck. Go, open it. Who is it? Password! Assholes! Open it! It's one I know. But how, do they ask anyone who taps for the password? Yes I know. They want to conspire, but they are scared. By the way, Leonida, the revolution has gone downhill from there. - You can give up. - It's because? Because Brother Filippo Spada was a snitch, an informer, ... snitch, trumpeter, talker, snitch. Finally, he opened his mouth and sang. - What did he say? - He reported it! Calm down! Proceed. I heard about this at Castel Sant'Angelo. But if I heard correctly, your friend didn't give the names... of the conspirators. Made a general complaint. I always say that the nobles make a revolution like a fox hunt. Because they are upset, not because it pleases them. Don't forget the Army is with us. - A mercenary army? - Let's go, please ... And I say you have to see it clearly... Is it true what this one told us? And who knows him? - The Crow, nice to meet you. - Are you a Carbonario like us? Let's not get confused, you make the revolution... and I'm a shoemaker. Each one takes care of their business. I only warned them as a matter of human charity. - Is there a way out here? - What you think? I don't think, I'm not a doctor like you. You have to understand it, it's not your fault. - He lacks education. - And you lack the people. But what you said, it's serious. He is sure? As Brother Filippo's second daughter contracted smallpox, ... he declared, "This is the punishment that Almighty God sends me..." "for having conspired against the Pope". And ran to the castle... confess to Colonel Nardoni. And I told her: "That my little daughter may be saved" ... And was it saved? They bury her tonight. In the end, there is always justice. So if you hurry, there's still time to flee... and to be safe. Do you go out there too? Calm! If they bury the girl tonight, there's still time. Nardoni will wait until tomorrow to make Filippo say the names. The Roman police are always respectful when there is a dead man in the middle. If we don't want them to bury us tomorrow, ... we must bury this very night... Brother Filippo. So I'm going. - And this Filippo Spada, where does he live? - Okay, we just needed the madman! Here are the rules. Let's see who will be drawn. And instead of one, let's draw two. - A single knife could fail. - Especially if it's yours. Long. Hold it. - Because I? - Your hand is impartial. Let's go. Don't do this, listen to me! I was drawn! Wait, boy. One more to go. Who will take it? Whoever was drawn, is drawn. But what do you think, that we're going to a ball? Please. Don't do that, I'm warning you, you're going to break your face. Why don't you shut up, that ill-omened bird? They call me Crow. Who is this madman? Allow me a word? Just the two of us, if you don't mind, boy. How long have you known me? Well, as long as you work with Crow, right? Yes I work ... The fact that I work is an excuse. You understand... I'm Jewish. And if a Christian lives with a Jew, ... - it's bad business. - All right, but what does it matter? No, nothing. Anyway, we see each other often. Is weird, ... but it's been a while since a day has passed... without you breaking a shoe, or dropping a heel. But I am a doctor, I walk. I do not think like that. Yes, because once it's in the shoe store, there's no one to take it away. Well, you know how Crow is, he talks, talks, talks... - and I have fun listening to it. - Clear. And why, while you listen to him, do you keep looking at me? What is this, an interrogation? Are you in love with me by any chance? And just now did you notice? I have what to do. Goodnight. Leo! Me either. Is it your lover? And you, why don't you take care of your affairs? No, it's not out of curiosity. If you want, I'll go alone. - Nobody loves me. - But, ... - where should you go? - Is nothing. - Where are you taking him? - Judging a traitor. What are you going to do, stay here? I go alone. Do not stop! I don't like you going to risk your neck. Giuditta, let it be. It's not the moment. Look out, hide! Dragons, loud! Tonight, the round is big. What could have happened? Not! There's still time, don't go. Don't leave me, Leo. Let's run away together, ... far away from this weeping city, full of grim people. To Naples. In Naples, there is sun. And King Ferdinand. What's the use of beheading people? If you love me, don't do this. Don't go, don't do this. Uncomfortable? Oh, that one, again! - Let's go? - Let's go! To where? I won't let you go alone with this madman. Go ahead. Giuditta, try to understand... I need to go. No, no, hold me... hold me tight. But don't you understand that I love him too? At night I dream of you. Where are you going with that madman? I am scared. Do not go. But what do you push me away? Leo, you've lost your mind! Run after me if you can! - Who is it? - It's me, Filippo. - I wanted to give you my condolences. - Thanks, Montanari. No, no, not for your girl. It's for you. You are the one who is dead! No, no, for charity! I'm a family man! It's a whistleblower. What do you two laugh about? Not! Not! Calm down! Come people! Help! Christians! I was stabbed! I was really stabbed! Is dead? It seems not. Or maybe yes! Not sure, I don't know. I do not feel anything. They made a hole in his belly that goes down to the basement. So it's dead. It's still alive. But maybe die. What if he doesn't die? - Better for him. - But it's worse for them, ... - if he lives, he will speak, he will say who he was. - And then? So must die. - Well, hopefully so. - No, not expected! - Must die! Now! - Oh no ... I had warned them. So is this the revolution? An informer lying on the ground... and that he's not even dead. And now, what do you want from me? Next time, let them learn to use the knife. There will be no next time for them if he doesn't die! - You should do it! - Me? - But no way! - Then I will! Let it be, Giuditta, this is a man's job. - Take! - Or what? - It's a man's job, isn't it? - Well, it's just that there are men and men, ... I wouldn't know how to do it in the heat, imagine "in the cold". - Still! - Which is? The Dragons. What Dragons? It's the Dragons! Run, Giuditta, it's the Dragons. Run! Where are you going, asshole? Ah, there, we arrived in the Holy City. Don't look, Serafin, or you'll be impressed. Grant them eternal rest, O Lord ... and let perpetual light shine upon them. Rest in peace. Amen. Walk! We need to find them, him and that crazy one! Let's go! Let's go home. If they pick us up on the streets at this hour, ... damn me for telling him where they were. We can not do anything. It can help you escape from Rome, ... Ripetta's boatmen leave tonight. There is one who is your friend, no? Friend, friend ... I put you socks, ... is no more than a customer. Come on, let's go! Yes, let's go the other way. Let's separate. We're going to walk all night, but we have to find him. We need to find him, Crow! I go this way, and you go there. But we need to find him! Why are you looking at me? No, it's just been an hour that says "let's find him". As far as I know, they were in two. Or is it enough for you that we find just one? But what does it say? Hurry up. And now let's toast our Pope, ... the Pope Leo. To Pope Lemon. Hey, why, is it his fault if he suffers from liver? - Be quiet. - That's right! To Pope Leo. Lemon ... Again ... And what does it matter if it's Leo or Lemon? What do we care? Health and male children. Male children? It is said that the wife of the Captain of the Swiss ... gave birth to a yellow boy who looks like a Chinese. Then, in Rome, we will also have the daddy heir. Well... they are young. In addition, it is understood, are resentful, ... because this Pope... ordered to put bars in the taverns. He said: "The wine is served outside,"... "thus do not rally within to conspire against the Government." But who conspires? Here they sang, they laughed... Of course, sometimes there was a death, ... but not by rebellion, ... always for futile reasons, happily. Hey guys! The cannon sounded for you too. And we're barely caring about the cannon! See? They no longer accept impositions. The people are tired. More than anything else, he looks drunk. Give us two more glasses. Go to bed. Whoever wants to send us to bed by force was not born. A hundred men like him and we took power! Judith! What was it? What's? Filippo Spada did not die. And thankfully, to make that work of art, they went in two. If you think about killing someone again, take a cannon. - Was found? - I do not know, ... but if they find him, he will speak. Let's go fast. But what are you going to do, are you going to take her away? A hundred men like him and we're lost. Wait, we can't run away like this, we need to warn the others. Don't think about others, think about you, you two are in danger. Let's go! Where are we going? First at Corvo's shoe store, and then we'll see. Just don't catch us on the street. Stop! To the ground! Leo, we are lost. To the ground! To the ground! But it's you! Be patient, dear doctor, I hadn't recognized you. They put me in charge of the Pasquin doll. Why, are they afraid they'll steal it? They are afraid you will speak. So, understand, I need to always be on the lookout for whoever comes. So if anyone approaches, I shoot. So why didn't you shoot? Curse! Excuse me, doctor! Stop there! Get out of there! Big tolo ...! Got it, motherfucker...! Colonel! - And this, what is it? - And is ... "Sell or Papa no throne, ..." "an outsider asked:" "That's the Holy Father, isn't it?" "But the Captain of the Swiss who heard, ..." "Answered: Holy, no. But Father, yes." Are you laughing? And who laughs? Did you see who it was? I don't know, Excellency. If I had seen it, I would have shot. Know! A voice that has been speaking for four centuries, ... don't shut up with a shot. No, I take a moment to identify Dr. Montanari. Montanari? About Dr. Montanari? - And where is it? - There he is. - No "hey he is"! - It was there, just now, ... with another guy and with that non-Christian who works with Crow. Excellence. Here, take this one to the Captain of the Swiss at Castel Sant'Angelo. You'll find him awake, the baby is crying. Montanari, why not? It hasn't come back yet. Calm down, try not to lose your mind. But did you not understand that you are the one who is about to lose her? Well, if you had any doubts, now it's cleared up. And I don't know if it's clear to you either. I have horns. - No, I... - And damn your revolution. Nardoni is arriving with the patrol. Let's pretend I'm bad... and you came here to consult me. Oh my God, how bad I feel! Oh my God, how I feel, ... what I have? You have a heart the size of a house, Raven. And you have the brain of a chicken. The revolution... makes me laugh! And who wants to do it in Rome? And that other one even comes from outside, from the Grand Duchy of Modena! Because they are educated, who knows who they believe they are. - Excuse me. - Please. If I bother you so much,... I can go back to Modena. Corvo! We want ... only freedom. - And you want her too! - Me? I don't give a damn about freedom. What is it for me? When it's daytime, I get up, ... when it's time to eat, I sit, ... and when it gets dark, I go to bed. I comply with the mandatory Easter Precept. I don't drink, I don't blaspheme, I don't bother anyone... and love a woman who is in love with another. Make the revolution? I would spit in my face myself! Egg-loose. Oh my God, how bad I feel! Oh God, what a pain! What do I have, doctor, tertiary fever? - Yes, Franciscan. - No, no, here, in the belly. Is Dr Montanari by any chance here? Who is it? As far as I'm concerned, you can go barefoot, the shoe store is closed. Oh, Excellency, how bad I feel! Come back at another time, it could be something epidemic, contagious. Doctor, after you've finished seeing Crow, ... Could you please come with me? What for? Because we found Don Filippo Spada lying on the ground. One would say that he was stabbed. Oh, poor thing! But if you hurry, maybe you can make it in time to save your life. Why, not dead? Well, looks like not. And does he speak? And what interests you if he speaks? Should you include it in your will? Worry, instead, breathe. You better hurry. Oh no! How, hurry up? Let's take it easy. I arrived earlier. I have spastic pain. What could I have eaten, the vegetable worms? Doctor, don't leave me, I'm already feeling them. I'm getting all cold... If you leave, here comes the priest. No, the priest does not enter here. And you will die in mortal sin,... since he lives in a marital relationship with a Jew. But how, in a marital manner, Excellency? She is my maid, who keeps the ledgers, ... count the toes of customers, ... because I cannot count, Excellency, I am ignorant. By a damn chance she's Jewish, but who touches her? It disgusts me! Do you want me to spit on her? I spit you... get out! I'll wait for you outside, doctor. Be quick. Oh my God, the belly! Oh, how bad I am! Oh, how bad I am! But you guys are worse. I'm ready. Let's go? Not, ... he doesn't know you. I better go alone. And then Filippo may die without regaining consciousness. Ah, go trust the doctors! Crow... if it had... If something happens to me, take care of Giuditta. But I took care of it very well, even before you arrived. The thinker has arrived. Maybe with a little luck... It's better not to say anything. Who knows? You will see that he will come back. Hey, what do you do, is it changing the guard? Open the door. - And him, don't we help him? - Yes, ... I became the protector saint of the Carbonari. Do not worry, ... I have no intention of leaving Montanari alone. Can you show me the way to reach them? - Poor boy. - "Poor boy, ..." playing with knives. They believe, Crow. It has an ideal. They're not like you or me, who don't believe in anything. We're just good at crying and whining. Come, I'll accompany you, or you'll get lost along the way. What's the name of the river boatman you know? - Oh, I don't know. - Come on, Crow, it's the one with the skin. - What is your name? - I do not know! The one with the midsole! I don't ask for names, they call it Cannavota. Fortunately. Let's go! Greetings, brother. And thank you very much. Yes... get out. Poor girl. On the same night, the sister's funeral and now it's the father who dies. That's why I say, let's take him to the Hospital. At least let's try. After all, if you stay here, you die anyway. So you better stay. Perhaps, in a moment of lucidity, he will say who it was. But does it seem human to you to let this poor man die like that? I must think of the community, not the individual. I know you don't agree, but let's talk, ... so we pass the time, while we wait. But what do we expect? Well, maybe he does. - And I need to wait too? - I would say yes. Would you say maybe he includes me in his will? You never know. Don't you ever get there? - Let's go this way. We arrived earlier. - You're wasting time. I'm not going to Cannavota. - Let's go. - I want to go to Montanari. Wait a minute. Understand. Shall we go there? Do you know who is playing? - Is it Cannavota? - It's Paulina Borghese. Napoleon's sister. Yes, but don't think about the statue of Canova, ... naked on a marble sofa. You must see how reduced the skin and bones are. She is always closed in there, recluse with her mother. The Lady Letizia. Two old owls, wrinkled ... always spying on the neighborhood from behind the blinds... to intrigue. What a decay! Of course life is a disaster. When I think about life, I'm scared to death. So what do we do? Let's stay here? I don't understand her, Montanari is in danger... - and you stay here, like at a concert. - Well, what do you want to do? But aren't you your lover? Me? No. We're just friends. Do you listen to Crow? That's a poor jealous fool, sees lovers where there is none. And maybe you don't see them where they could actually exist. Don't move, the guards are here. Oh my mother. They are surrounding us. And what should I do? Must have courage. Sorry ... And then? Getting some fresh air, huh? But aren't you the Jew, by any chance? And you don't know what day it is? A day like others. No, it's Saturday. Well I didn't remember. - C'mon C'mon. - Just a moment. No, no, let it be, please. This is an outsider passing through Rome. He asked me for information, I don't even know him. So don't meddle. I want to see where it takes her. Do whatever you want. Let's go! No, not him! I am ashamed. Please. I'll. And you, Hebrew people, ... who wonders why he is cursed. By me it should be more cursed. But how, even Pilate, who was a pagan, ... Her conscience shivered and she washed her hands. Because the Roman understood, perhaps he intuited, ... and you, instead, nothing... Every Saturday is this litany. As if we've been there in person. And then they also make us go to Mass. It's because? To convert them, no? Don't listen to him, they do it in mockery. But if they were the designs of Providence... that Christ should suffer and die like a man, ... someone should kill him. And it was us Jews. Did we do it wrong? I say we did well. Thus we fulfill God's will. So instead of chasing us,... should respect us. Ugly dirty, they are pigs, damned, ... And don't they rebel? Come on, sir. The Semites are smart, they don't listen to a word... More, please, ... that it stays between us. Look in the ears! They put cotton tampons, ... poor things. We pretend not to see, because we are tolerant. ... they went to mass every Sunday ... ... give thanks for the mercy of our lord, ... Pope Leo XII, who instead of throwing them together in the river, ... he enlarged the ghetto to make them more comfortable. - Is not true! - How, isn't it true? Is not true! Don't listen to him, he's a liar! Don't be fooled, ... he enlarged it to bring in those outside as well! Because they could contaminate Christians! As if being a Jew was an epidemic! Christ, Jesus, Mary, what must be heard! Then everyone can go home. After all, I preach to the wind. I sit... No, no, brother, go on. I take care of public order. Yes, you do. And where do we get? I'll take her away, and if you think to stop me... In the past, when sermons were delivered, ... you couldn't hear a fly fly, everyone came to hear ... This is longer, sir. What do we want to do, cause a diplomatic incident? Take her home. After the cannon is fired, it cannot be circulated. I don't look at them. ... I say we're going to start the sermon over. Do I prepare them? Do I know them by heart? I speak so, as the heart dictates. Now I don't remember where I left off. In "Ugly Dirty, Damn Pigs" ... Generally, a stab is some cuckold's revenge. But if in Rome there was a cuckold, ... it was really... Ah! In these matters, I always make mistakes, you know. Maybe because I'm single. So what is the reason, according to you? Consult a police officer, I am a surgeon. Oh yes, I know. But ... I say it like that, just to say it, to pass a little time. Let's see... for a hypothesis... A hypothesis, what interests me? Ah! That's it. It could have been politically motivated. Do you think it's political? Well, that Don Filippo had liberal tendencies, ... All of Rome knew it. Moderate trends, understand. But if so, who could stab him? An opponent. And that would be like saying you could have given it to me or a priest. So, the political motive is also excluded. Oh no! It is not right? No, why ... these Jacobin liberals often kill each other. Nothing less! Yes, because everyone thinks how they want. There are those who want the Republic, those who want the constitutional Pope. In short, an anarchy. And then, they kill each other. Anyway ... have you thought, doctor, ... how can you stab a man for politics? Kill him just because he doesn't think the same way you do. No, I'm sorry. But doesn't the government also kill those who don't think like it? Never heard of the guillotine? Well, what does it matter? But the Government is not a man. It's another thing. It's an abstract thing... So, if it's the government that kills, ... it's like no one has killed. Of course it is known that you do not meddle in politics. No not me. What if... you happened to sympathize with Jacobinism... would you stab me? But I would give you one right now, for making me lose all night. Soon. To travel to the countryside, you have to go during the war... or the bandits assault you. Return and find the exterminated family. Newborn cesarine, buried. My husband, a corpse. Damn sentimental Italy! No, I'll be back to Vienna soon, to my mother. - No, for so little... - Yes, yes, yes. - It's serious? - Like? For my own sake, I want to know if he's going to die. Do you also want to know what time? - You ignorant idiot! - No, don't shoot! What insolence, these bourgeois! I need to go home, change clothes. It's because? Because tonight there's a big party... in the Rospigliosi house. Ah, I should have gone to a ball too, ... but unfortunately ... But should my husband really stay on the ground? No, just a moment. Wait. Princess, ... I beg you to desist. I have to object. - And then, it can't be loaded. - Why? I can tell you, Colonel. Because it is expected that, before you die, you will file a complaint. They go! It is agreed that he stays on the ground, only if he is dead. But he's still alive, he can't stay like this, on the ground. - I will send servants from my house. - Thanks. What time will it be? - Well... - Too late... Oh, Mariana, dear girl, ... did you go to your sister's funeral Yes? Now Mommy is back soon, before she has to go to a big dance. Daddy has his big toe sticking out. And now it's also my fault that that bastard... don't you ever cut your toenails? Wait for me to solve everything! Let's go! There it is, if they stab that one over there, I would understand. Let it be, Angelo. Run away. Montanari didn't want you to go too. It wouldn't help at all. I can't, Giuditta. Need to go. But if they arrest you, who are the best, ... what will be left for us? Who will give us hope? Besides, it's not fair. You are young, you are tender, ... why must die? Because I swore. Either free or dead. Ah, you frighten me. Angelo, ... soon it will be day and there are less risks. The river is full of boats that come and go. It's in a basement and tomorrow who knows where it will be. Far away... Maybe in Naples. In Naples, there is sun. But there is also King Fernando, ... that one is worse than the Pope. You must always think of Kings and Popes. Don't you have other ideas going through your head? - I would, I would have another one. - And which one? I love her. Angelo... what did you say? No, nothing. So I don't let you go. But I need to go. You stay here with me. I hadn't promised her I would run away. All right, I know, you warned me. But I love you. I said that too. Don't repeat it. Whats the way? Patch, patch! This is the path that leads to the guillotine. Straight ahead, you can't go wrong. Then I go. Perhaps Filippo died without regaining consciousness. Perhaps. Well, since the Princess brought this, ... she could have had a bed brought for us too. I'm sleepy... Why? Not comfortable? The man, waiting for the serene passing... Look who's there! Wasn't he with you at Crow's house? What strange customs! What are you doing? But what kind of a question, doctor! The dog always follows SÃ£o Roque. No, don't laugh. In my opinion, it would have been better if you had stayed in Modena... Sr. Targhini. Would you like a cup of coffee? - Yes thanks. - You're welcome. Sir, sir, daddy moves his fingers! Carolina ... Imagine if she, tonight, came home. But where did the ceiling go? And you, what are you doing in my room? But what a draft there is in this room! It's Dr Montanari, ... But then, if the doctor is here, ... does it mean i'm sick? And these, who are they? Soldiers? But what do I do in bed, in the middle of the street? My goodness! What is all this blood? I did not remember. I was stabbed! - Who? Who? - Who? With who? Ah, it was those two there. Montanari and this one. Maybe you don't believe it, doctor... but until the last minute, I was hoping it wasn't you. He has a serious profession, useful to his neighbor, to the Nation. And besides, at your age! If it had been just him, an outsider... Well if it satisfies them... - So life goes on. - Like? No, I said... Marco Aurelio... he always goes on horseback to Campidoglio, ... Filippo Spada did not die and, by the grace of God, he is expected to heal... Targhini and Montanari await sentencing, ... and I'm still a shoemaker, ... and I leave serious thoughts to whoever... has more head than me. Am I wrong, Excellency? Do well, dear Raven. It's good. I wanted to be like you, blind in one eye. Oh, that would be fine. I don't see it clear even with both of them. But is different ... because, see, after you've made two soles and a pair of boots... he did much more than his duty. On the contrary, I don't. I distinguished myself in the repression of banditry... and I lined up 45 bandit skulls, ... between Saint German and Rome. Happy trip! Ah, in those days, I was not yet a Prince of the Church, ... but a simple shepherd of souls. But you know, as they say, "this Rivarola is a guy"... - "which makes one respect." - Damn! Not! Do not see? I also speak to you, who are a humble shoemaker. In fact, I owe you the utmost respect. But what do you do, kiss the signet? Ah, it's the signet. Anyway, they say, "Let's get him to sue"... "against Targhini and Montanari." Will you take charge? So I recommend you be very careful. Because? For your health. With all this work, ... that you don't get tired. Yeah, but it doesn't end like that... because, when this process is finished,... I must run to Romagna to eliminate clandestine sects. And you know better than I that the Roma, ... as usual they are the turbulent subjects. In short, it never ends. Have you at least ended up with that shoe? Two more nails, Your Eminence. Crow, I'm coming. And this beautiful brunette, who is she? Giuditta de Castro, Eminence, at your service. Too bad, so beautiful and so Jewish. Anyway! Here in Rome, among Jews, Jacobins and bandits, ... there's no one left. We are left, Your Eminence, ... most faithful Romans. What do we care? Well, very well! I leave all your Rome to you. Hey, but what is it? Did a tarantula bite her? - But where are you going? - Be right back. - And what do I do? - Say two prayers. Where are you going? Stop! You stay here! What for? Look at you while playing the clown with the Cardinals? Besides, our agreement was clear. You said ... "We're two bastards, let's keep each other company while it lasts." And then? I'm still a bastard! Because, ... for you changed anything? Let's drop it, Crow. You understood me. - Do not wait! - Leave me alone! Judith, ... I ask him that way, out of curiosity. Did you really lose your mind over that one? And also for that other poor fellow. It gives me a pity! Did you go... to bed? In floor. Congratulations, Dr Montanari! Not! How not? With Targhini. Lost your mind over Targhini, that simpleton? No. By Montanari. Hey, wait a minute! I did not understand! But how, did he fall in love with Montanari and sleep with Targhini? No, it's just that... Crow, don't bother me! No ... Corvo ... - Ah, the shoe, Eminence! - I know, if I expected you...! - Sorry, it fell on me. - She left him, didn't she? No... I fired her. Well, there is no reason to be ashamed for having fallen in love with a Jew. - It happens. - Is life. And I'll tell you something else. One thing I just say to you, ... and that, in the world, nobody knows. Ah thank you. But I recommend you stay between us. Say, Your Eminence, my fault is precisely ignorance. As I see it, these Hebrews are human beings almost like us. - Not! - Ah yes. "Today, the 31st of October in the year of the Lord 1825, we Augustines of ..." "Santa Agata De Subburra, of the Holy Roman Church, ..." "Cardinal Deacon Rivarola, for special soon..." "Delegate of His Holiness, our Lord Pope Leo XII..." "fortunately reigning, presiding over the Court etc., etc., etc., ..." "calling on the Holy Name of God and having His righteousness alone..." "before the eyes,..." Let's get to the point, Eminence! "The cases in this case were read and weighed..." "examined exceptions and excuses made by them, ..." But which ones? What excuses if they didn't even let us open our mouths? And what do you want? A lawyer? "It is recognized that the existence of the Carbon Society is fully recorded..." "in the pontifical domains and that the aforementioned Society seeks to disturb..." "of the social order to sacrifice everything for revenge, for theft..." - They took us for bandits. - Worse, son, worse! Because bandits have the mitigation of being starving. "And that all things were actually verified in the process..." "by the spontaneous confessions of people belonging to the aforementioned..." "Carbon Society..." - We were betrayed, Angelo! - Silence! What am I doing here, am I a puppet, brats? "And by the spontaneous confessions of numerous whistleblowers that, ..." "according to the law, they enjoy the privilege of impunity..." "and the secret of his revelations." - Listen, Your Eminence! - Shut up! After all, it is not possible to interrupt the reading of a sentence every minute. Do you call it "sentence"? Make me laugh! Laugh, laugh, and then you'll hear the lark sing. "We judge definitively and condemn without appeal..." "to the aforementioned Leonida Montanari and the aforementioned Angelo Targhini, guilty of ..." "high treason, Lesa-Majesty, attempted murder and prohibited weapon possession." "And therefore we condemn them to the ultimate punishment of torture, by ..." "decapitation." And now? Don't laugh anymore? Lost your breath? Good thing they sentenced them to death. If they gave perpetual, it would be torture. What have you got, Angelo? Are you afraid of dying? So what's up? - Can I ask you a question? - Say it. Giuditta. What's between you two? She, poor thing, tried to stop me. Said, "Don't kill him, let's run away together." "We are going to Naples." "In Naples, there is sun." Listen to me! Guys, there's a visit for you! Brief, because I shouldn't allow it. And then, don't allow it. It bothers me that they always seem to be doing favors. It is the paternalism of tyrants. - So what do I do, send her away? - But, who is it? And do I know? - It is me. - Quick, huh? No! You talk to me? - I understood. - No, I understood. And then? Am I a whore? I asked both of them a question and would appreciate an answer! On the other hand, that's right. What could you think? But I tried. And how can you tempt a woman? With conversations? Huh? Talking about politics? What other way does a woman have to compete with men? What have? There's only love, or what the hell you call it. I tried with love. - In shifts. - Clear! And since I was bad with you, I tried with this other one. Yes sir! Said, "At least I saved one." I did not make it. Patience. Well, at least you feasted on him. Yeah, I don't even tell you! But, after all, what do you want? That I feel indebted to you? I'll pay you the bill soon! I don't care! Get out! Gladly, but this is a prison, not an inn. And what do you do now? What's? Can't make Targhini go out for a moment? So that you can get some air. No, but if you want, I can send you to Castelo Gandolfo! Let me out for a bit. She wants to be alone with Montanari. I beg you! All right, and where do I put it? If I had another cell free... Is one last grace denied to a condemned man? Please. Come on, boy. Let's walk a little, let's go. But what are you doing? Not! Be comfortable. Forgive me, Leo. I'm not willing. Not eu. Forgive me for Angelo? I wish I had managed it with him. It's young. - I would have had... my whole life ahead of me. - Is that you? Me? I'm just not calling! But how, don't you care? Don't you think about me? I love him, don't you understand? I fell in love. Giuditta. Do not look at me like that. Let me die in peace. Come on, go. I get older and less understand the world. Let's get going. - Forgive me, Angelo. - From what? Whoever makes a revolution must not carry anything with him. Loves, affections are cannon projectiles tied to the feet. The revolutionary is like a saint. Leave everything, and instead of the cross, take the dagger and go. - And where are you going alone? - We're not alone. If the people... If people suddenly wake up... Allows a word? And then? Make me understand, was it dark? - Which? - No, I mean... couldn't you see? But when? When, anyway... you thought it was Montanari, but it was Targhini. - You could have been wrong, no? - Not! I don't understand her. And what do you want to understand, Crow? Fix shoes and be quiet! Stay back! Do you want to stop this symphony? - Let's go this way, it's faster. - Where are we going? What do you know where I'm going? Okay, but you get here first! No, don't go, Giuditta. Wait! The suffrage of the souls of those condemned to death. Come on, Giuditta. Here you can only get bitter, that's all. - Plenary indulgence. Make an offer. - Kiss my ass! One hundred thousand years of forgiveness and perpetual remission of sins. Make an offer, which suits you. But is it fair? Good, ... Of course. You still don't know anything. Pretend not to see. It hides its head in the ground, like an ostrich. But don't you see that as soon as you lift it, they cut it off? - What can we do? - Make an offer. I already did. - The only thing is to love yourself. - Wanting yourself well? In a world like this? Precisely because the world is like that. The ideal would be to love two. But as this cannot be intended... Let's be content. One loves and the other is company. And who do you love? - Me. - To whom? You make me laugh! Giuditta, I understand that you have fallen in love with Montanari. Or maybe the other, or the two together. What do I know? Patience. I will take into account. Didn't you hear the cannon? Go to sleep. - Let's go home, Giuditta. - Go, go to sleep. Continue to sleep! While the best will always break your face. Sleep, Raven, sleep always! Yes, but let's sleep together. At least, if during the night we feel scared, we hug each other tightly. Embrace your aunt's bones! You don't need a woman! He needs a nanny to hold him under his wing! - I don't think about sleeping with a coward! - No, coward, no. - Whoever loves is never a coward. - But you didn't see the guillotine? Look at what a carnival! And you don't even have the guts to say it's not fair. It's true, Crow. You are not a coward. You are nothing! - It's not even a man! - Oh, no, Giuditta! You, as a lover, can even spit in my face. But as a man, you must respect me. A man does not judge himself only in a bed. Not enough. What are you doing, brother? I write the names of those condemned to death, to place under the Tabernacle. Like? Do you write Targhini without the "h"? It would read "Targini". - He thinks? - Give it to me here, I write. There, done. And take off that hood. It's scary. No, no, it's better this way. Corvo! The illiterate shoemaker knows how to write. Very curious and good to know! Good to know. Good to know! Raven! So you know how to write! But why all this mystery? Is it a shame to know how to write? No, but it is often a risk. The Carbonari make me laugh. Who are? The casters of what? Hey, speak with respect! They risked their heads. Heads can be cut off as many as you like. It's the languages ââthat count. Each one does his battle. I chose mine. Yes, to be a shoemaker. No, that of being the voice of Rome, that of popular dissatisfaction. But what are you saying? I am the real rebellion! Giuditta, don't be surprised, ... I'm Pasquin. Yes, ma'am, I am the mysterious satirist. The one who writes the infamous libels against the Government. Yes, I disguise myself as a fool to deflect suspicion! Meanwhile, I denounce abuses and the people register. Will you wake up? And how can I know? Or do you want me to wake you up by throwing rocks through the windows? Or would you like him to wake up whenever you want? Or when they want Targhini and Montanari? Crow,... but I didn't know! Well, now that you know, what changes? I'm Pasquin, it doesn't matter. I am cuckolded and I am still cuckolded. But then... then you can do something! You can save them! Me? Who do you take me for? Why Santa Rita de Cassia? But fuck you and them! It's over, Giuditta! Dear brothers, is entry allowed? Peace and good! Peace and good! The time has come? As they say: Mors right, now uncertain". But that depends on you. The secular arm, which is Justice, handed them over to the spiritual arm,... that's us. - But "we", who? Who are you? - Who am I? And what does it matter to you who I am? We are specks of dust. Want to know my name? And it's not even mine, it's changed when we enter. And so. But don't you see who I am? And why has the secular arm turned us over to you? But do you want to know everything? Who are you? Because that's the procedure. We will hand them over to the secular arm as soon as they have repented. - Sorry, of what? - Oh! Sorry for what? Of the crimes they committed. We certainly can't kill them right away, because if we kill them like that... you would go straight, straight, to Hell. And we, here, work for the Eternal Father, not the Devil. Therefore, it is necessary to repent, and then die in the grace of God. What if we don't regret it? How, do not regret it! Is that how you respond? What is one of our virtues, brothers? According to you, what virtue do the friars have? None that I know of. - Not? However, we do have one. - Which? It's patience, son. Otherwise, by then I would have punched you in the head. However, with patience, I stay here, and seek to save their souls. And until they have not repented, there will be no execution. This is our Order's right, my children. So, for execution, we must wait. Maybe 100 years for one to regret. Yes, I know, everyone says that, but with patience, everything is achieved. No, just a moment. Patience takes time. Ah, no one is rushing me. By the way, give me a chair because I understand... that this issue will not be resolved in two stages. And with time, anything can happen. So, friar? Do you want some advice, children? Ask God for forgiveness right away. Okay, so it makes us cut our heads off quickly. Hey Hey! What it says? The head, the head! What is she anyway? How small, children! Linked to miseries! What is life? Open your eyes and it's already night. They get so excited, they look for who knows what, they want to revolutionize the world, ... but there is no time! Life is short. Ask God for forgiveness soon! Save souls, ... because the end of man is eternity. Because that's where we'll all go! - But we'll go the other way. - To where? - Bravo, Angelino. - How, brave? He's kind of silly. There is no other side. There is no escape! Either we're all going to Hell, or we're all going to Heaven. We want to go? You will. We, even after death, will remain in the world. - For what? - To set an example for those who stay. And who will stay? But who will stay? What's left of the Egyptians? Nothing! Four dry mummies. And of the Romans? Four walls down! And what of the Etruscans? Nothing! Two drops. Will the Carbonari stay? What Carbonaries? Those who sell charcoal, not you. Save souls, children! They will go to Paradise! I can send them, because unworthily, I have that power. But we still don't want to go. Not happy? The less they are, the better they are, no? Already understood. So I'm going to sit down. My children, would I stay here speaking against my interests? The more we go, the more we will show that we are right! But that's the question. We don't want to repent to prove you wrong. - How are we going to solve it? - I wanted to cry. But I can not. See, if you were right, I would be dressed like this, ... to listen to you, who offends me with these earrings? What a pity you give me, son! Jesus Christ, Mary, help me you! Mercy, how hard these two are to bend! What's? What have? - I felt, all of a sudden... - What did you feel, son? I don't know, like a mess inside the soul. What can it be? Perhaps the awareness that awakens. You are younger and less sin-hardened like he is. What it does? Get out! What look? - Do you want to regret it, my son? Huh? - Perhaps yes. Shall we pray together? Let us pray. Holy Mary ... No, maybe I better think some more. By myself. So are you making fun of me? Ah understood! You want to play. So, enough talking. We'll talk tomorrow. Go, that's better. Perhaps, with a fresh mind, ... could rethink and maybe... But what does it do? Does not go away? And where am I going? - And do you need to pray here? - Still! What do you think, that I have fun? I'm working! I'm praying for you. Hey, if I'm so uncomfortable, pretend I'm not here! No, huh? Like this, when do we sleep? Never! Until you repent, I won't let you close your eyes! Ave Maria ... Jesus, Joseph and Mary! I am sleeping? And the Carbonari, where are they? They were beheaded! My mother, I lost two souls! My lord, forgive me! Open up! Make me leave! It's open! - Prison officer! Prison officer! - Good Morning. Did you sleep well? What are you doing up there? Who made them leave? Me. It's the regulation. But what regulation? These shouldn't even sleep! Get out of the way! I'll show you me! Regulation! But what regulation? - Brother. - Oh, are you here? Tonight, praying, praying, he took me out of bed, and lay down. Me? But what are you saying? And how you snore, brother! It looks like an animal! Yes, I fell asleep, so what? The flesh is weak, children. But the spirit is always vigilant. Look at that sky, look at those clouds! Those scattered clouds! But who put them up there? And those Swiss guards, who put them there? - Where? - There. Attention, you unbelievers! We are all under the same cloak. Here it is. Look at him. This is our cloak. Look at this dome that rises towards the sky. And for what? And that cannon aimed at Rome, what good is it? Ah, the cannon, the cannon! But why do they always look at the ground? Look up! - Ah understood! Keep playing. - But you were the one who told us. But you know, son, in what sense I said it. Friar, it is useless for you to tell us stories. Up there, there is no one. Worse for you guys. I give you eternal life and you kick my ass. But can you know what kind of people you are? With one hand they kill us and with the other they give us eternal life. - These are the contradictions of power, son. - Friar, the tour is over. - Come on, the cell is this way. - And we're going there. - Want to join us? - To where? Put you in the basement? One step forward towards the scaffold. But is that how you say it? This one seems content to climb the scaffold. Look at these! Where will they go? What you want? Nor do I know. I didn't sleep all night. Let's make a deal, Eminence. I give you the Pasquin and you save Montanari's life. And since when do shoemakers go around making these offers? Hurry up, because if I think again I realize that I end up losing. And nothing else is done. Pasquin in exchange for Montanari, you say. Do you want to compare any Carbonarinho with the mysterious epigrammatic satirist? Ah, if I were you, I wouldn't despise Carbonarinho so much. Or do you say that because you wanted to include Targhini as about price? No, Your Eminence, we are not in the market. With him do what you want, that one is naive. Well, and what are these preferences? I spoke like that because I didn't want to take them both away. Even if they are black sheep, remember, ... I am always a shepherd of souls. Good morning, Your Eminence! See, that's a stray sheep, for example. Yes, but now let's conclude, maybe I'll shepherd her later. The soul! And why are you so interested in Montanari's skin? I offered you an agreement, with all due respect, Your Eminence ... what does it matter to you? If it suits you... It depends ... - And who would be Pasquin? - I know, wait. What you mean? Nothing, it's just that I'm not very diplomatic, Your Eminence, ... and maybe end up saying the name. So tell me. Let's do this way. You free Montanari first, they give you a horse, ... and sends him out through the Sensing Door. And then I'll tell you who Pasquin is. You have to trust. I trust. Come. - You first. - Yes, of course. - What are you going to do? - I just write. Oh of course you are illiterate... and do not understand. Now I explain to you. This is the feather, there is the inkwell, ... - I dip the pen in the inkwell... - No, I know that far. - But what do you want to write? - Montanari's release order. That's what you want, isn't it? That way we'll finally know who Pasquin is. Or have you changed your mind? - No. - Then why are you looking at me sideways? Oh, I know. Do not trust. Anyway, I stick to the facts. Here it is. But you can't read. - Right. - It doesn't matter. I read it to you. "Release the so-called Leonida Montanari." "Give him a horse and take him out through Porta SÃ£o JoÃ£o." "Signed: Rivarola". Immediately arrest Raven, bearer of the gift. Rivarola. And now, what should I do? It's a problem. Because you can't let anyone read it to you. - It's a state secret. - Clear. You must run to Castel Sant'Angelo, ... and deliver it in person... - to Colonel Nardoni. - Who can read. He, yes. Say it. Nothing, no signet, Eminence, or worthless. That's what I'm doing. Can't you see I'm doing it? Ah, ignorance. Bad thing, my dear Raven. See? It is always from ignorance that misunderstanding is born... between the subject and the Power. If you could read, ... now his face would not reflect a shadow of suspicion. And I would go quietly to Castel Sant'Angelo, you would say. There is no remedy but to trust. And I trust. The sentence must be carried out, ipso facto, by strangulation! Repent, bastards! There is no more time, ... death is near! Damn, how ugly death is! Kiss the cross, kiss the cross! Hey, what are you doing, squeezing? - And what should I do? - Leave him, do you want to kill him? They should only scare them away. Damn, how hard these two are! Get out, hooded! You can't ask for a favor! I thought they were executioners, not murderers. And you, not even fear moves you! How barbaric! But what did you want to do? - What games are these? - From priests, right? Say, these are priests' games, that's understood. I know what ruined you. Cynicism! Friar, may I make an objection? Do it, go. After all, you are always objecting. Seems to me you can't wait to see us climb the scaffold. Me? But what are you saying? Also, what is the gallows? It's just four wooden stakes together. You who committed the crime should have known you would end up there. What crime? How, which one? There is a fair sentence! Let the sentence be! Do you know what our crime is called? - What is your name? - Freedom. It is what it is? Leonida, you are not thinking of convincing a friar! Stay quiet! What did you want to tell me? Freedom, ... freedom does not exist. Think, you who feel so secure, it may seem to you... a heresy, but I feel free only when I obey. And me too. Whoever believes, obeys. Why, do you believe, son? Well, everyone believes what they want. But you act in good faith, brother. That's why I cherish you. Because only in good faith can you kill us, ... and then, at night, sleep peacefully. But what does it say? What are you saying? I never killed anyone, on the contrary. - I give them life. - Eternal. Only this one I can give you. Throw it away! Do you want to regret it, son? Son, do you want to regret it? Repent, son! Repent! Pray, pray, pray with me... Don't listen to him. He does it on purpose! Don't listen to him! No, but if you keep this up, they'll end up kissing. Don't listen to him! Not ashamed? Don't you really believe in anything? I believe only in Brutus, who kills the tyrant. The rest are conversations. Good faith makes me laugh. You are old. The enemy remains the enemy. And must be killed without mercy! At least I think so. You too, Leonida, are old. "The people are waking up" ... But what people? Who? - Don't you want to regret it? - Stop it, I said! Are you happy now? - Don't you have a mother, son? - Not. See? - Do you want to regret it? - Not. No, of course, I already knew. ... and therefore, if I go to Castel Sant'Angelo, they arrest me, ... and if I don't go, it's like declaring that I read the message... and that Pasquin is me. Slower down, I'm still on "and therefore..." What a beautiful successor I found! And then, Big Nose, this is a pity, not a cow's tit. You could have told me before teaching me how to write. As before? It's been 15 years we've tried, and you're still in the dictation. Ah, so let's drop it. See, in my opinion, knowing how to write is not enough, ... you have to have ideas. And I have them. You write... ideas come by writing. I give you an example. If you tell someone... "Damn you", what are you doing? You are saying blasphemy. But if you write it, it becomes an idea. So it's easy to become Pasquin. It is difficult to continue to be. Write ... Of course, these priests always know more than the Devil. Of course, otherwise the Devil would have already won. Therefore, we must outsmart the Devil and the priests together. So let's just let it go, we've already lost. Crow, we are simple people, at heart ... - What did you say? - What I said? - That we are... - I don't know. No, you said "we are simple people". And then? - Decoration. - Decoration. The heart! Cursed the hearts of those who have it! Nose, I understood everything. This is our ruin, the cataclysm of peoples. The heart ... Here it is necessary to change everything! But you are a thinker! You have thoughts even when you don't write! - Me? - And one can be more foolish than that... That's why it keeps us down. Because we have hearts and they don't. Wow, as the pen runs on the sheet. Looks like a hare. And I was playing my neck to please a woman. And when will we overthrow the bosses, if we continue to prowl... with your heart in your hands? Nose, do you want to become a man? - Why, what am I now? - Now it sucks, ... don't know anything. You are a slave! But if you want to be a man,... tear out the heart and throw it there where the cows wallow. Crow, what are you going to do? Where are you going? - I'll paste the last epigram. - And it doesn't tell me anything? But then what disciple am I? That's right, the disciple must spread the master's ideas. It is addressed to the Pope. "Why have we taken so long, Father Santo?" "Do we want to cut the necks of the Targhini and Montanari Carbonari?" "The executioner waits and is getting old. Hurry him up..." "and goodbye to the bucket." - He understood? - Yes, I got it! - You passed on to enemies. - And now, what I do? Do I spit or kick him in the mouth? - Do you think it's easy to understand? - Imagine being granted a pardon... and set them free. What would these people say with a heart? The boss is good. He pulls his ears when he goes crazy, it's understood... but in the end it's like a forgiving parent. And what do Targhini and Montanari become after they're released? - Are you still alive? - No, they would be pariahs. - Better than being dead. - No. Because the dead weigh... and killed like that, without crime, with a game of process, ... weigh even more. And over time, they become in bad conscience of the boss. Yes, but to those two, who will explain that they had better die? They already know. Because only in blood, ... only in blood does the boat of revolution travel. - Get it now? - Not a lot ... Does not matter. You will understand in time. Crow, there are guards, don't expose yourself. If you want, I'll paste the epigram. Nobody knows me. Take it. I promote you to field attendant. - And you, what will you do? Surrender? - War never ends. - What if they arrest him? - Power has the Achilles' heel, ... and these are entitled to rest. Knock, and you will be opened. I knock, and insinuate myself like a snake. I will be the viper in the bosom. I will do as did Dante Alighieri, who took refuge... and left after writing his Comedy. What are you looking for, brother? - Peace and soup. - Well, actually... Dante just said "peace". You added the soup. Because do not have? Another brother arrived. Add more water to the soup. Outside! Go away! Outside! Everyone home! You start with pranks and end up in prison and the guillotine! You too. And you too, little one. Outside! All sons of cows! And my dad. The Pope's soldiers don't understand anything... Attention! Clear the square! Didn't you hear the cannon fire? Let the cannon shot in the chest. - Oh, it's like that, huh? - Must be a sissy. Now they will show you, ... so they learn to retire at cannon time! The Pope's soldiers don't understand anything... Fire! Up, idiots! Hey what is it? Shots? - Who shoots? - Hey, they're shooting, Angelo! - Shoot? At where? - By the side of the river. - Where? - What is happening? People are waking up! We didn't believe, Angelo... The people are waking up! - The Republic is coming back! - Return? I do not know ... Now do you understand why we were buying time? - We screwed him! - And what do I have to do? What have I done to them? - Do you kill the priests too? - I do! The religious principle will be respected! Rejoice! Rejoice! Freedom comes to you too! Yes? Come to me too! Help! Open up! I don't trust these here! - Open up! What happened? - I do not know. It seems that the people... - is breaking into the prison. - Where? Soldiers! Soldiers! Well done, soldiers! Fortunately! Stop them! Stop them! Form a wall! It's already broken! What soldiers we have! They come to set us free. Cowardly people! Think about your business! - We want justice! - And justice will be done! - And when? - It depends on them. They must repent. What is expected to cut their necks? What does it matter to you if you don't regret it? Are you waiting to make you holy? I've already rented all the windows that overlook the square. And you want your money back! I rescheduled many important meetings... I've been walking since Genzano and my money is gone. The people want us dead! Okay, he woke up. Cut off their heads and end of conversation! People, what got you into your head? What you want? Do you want to order? And who are you? Is it Pope? Are you a Cardinal? Or is it a Baron? Because if you're not even a Baron, who are you? It's like the others! And the others, who are they? Reply ... Respond, instead of invading the Castle! Who is it? You are the remains of the Popes, Cardinals, Barons! And what are leftovers? They are garbage! People, you are garbage! And do you want to open your mouth? But if in the morning you have no one to tell you what to do, ... you don't even know where to start! What do you know? Went to school? Can you distinguish between the "pros" and the "cons"? You don't even know what your luck is, because it's garbage. But he stays clean, because he has no responsibilities... Go home, people! Go home, walk! But what does this friar want? Who he is? Who am I? Who am I? I am here for the condemned to death, but I must save their souls! What do you know of your soul, if I'm not the one explaining it to you? People pass by, but souls remain! Outside the soul, there is no salvation! And I need to send those over to Paradise! And I will send them by force! Even if I have to kill them of old age in here. I will send them because, unworthily, I received this mission. Who am I? Hey, what do you want? What are you doing? - Did you join the rebels? - Enough, brother, come with me. You two, carry him. And you, get out. The sermon is over. Get your hands off me, soldier! But how do they allow themselves to get their hands on a friar? - And who are you? - I'm Colonel Nardoni. And? Are you a colonel and do you want to rule too? I wish they sent the colonels. Don't you think things would be better? And do I know? But where are you taking me? To His Eminence, Cardinal Rivarola. - He wants to talk to you. - Your Eminence? Want to talk to me? Why didn't you just say so? Let's go! Where's the exit? Your Eminence, the people are a fierce beast! - It's thirsty for human blood! - It's not true, brother. Is not true. The people are not bad. You just need to understand the poor people. Rome became a wake. Nothing ever happens. Everyone beats their chest and everyone cries. And so, even an execution of justice, at least it's a new thing. - A show, a fun. - In Nero's time! At all times, son. At all times. But there was always a distraction for the people. And if it is denied, if they are slow to give it, it is understandable that the people will revolt. Therefore, even acknowledging your zeal, ... I think the time has come to satisfy the people. And how to satisfy him, Eminence? Those there are still unrepentant. Patience. But how, patience? If they are killed now, they will end up on land... not consecrated, with suicidal, unrepentant, prostitutes. We cannot always save everyone. Your Eminence, with all due respect... we must save everyone. We are priests! - Otherwise, what are we doing here? - What it says? - Eminence, grant them grace! - To whom? Those two poor people. Brother, you amaze me. It seems to be the first time it has provided assistance... - to two sentenced to death. - It is not the first time ... I give assistance to two like them. The others had always been people who had killed their mother, ... or beheaded a mistress, or stolen, or fabricated counterfeit money. It was easy for them to regret it. But what did they do? Filippo Spada is already cured. And it's better than before. And then? What other crime did they commit? That they plotted against the Government? And who paid attention to them? Not believe in the Eternal Father? They are young, they need time. A man, when he grows old, ... rethink it. I'm sure they will also rethink. They should have thought about it before. We put everything in the Lord's hands. No, Your Eminence. So we put everything in the Devil's hands. I became a priest to serve the Lord! And I? I became a Cardinal to serve whom? - Huh? - Come on, answer. - I do not know. - Here it is! See? Watch. But what if we are serving him poorly? We are men. And man remains a man with all his scruples,... doubts, and sometimes also with disbelief, but it doesn't matter, ... we are always on the right side. - Also when we make mistakes? - Especially when we make mistakes. It's easy to be on the right side when you're right. What is this, a dogma, Your Eminence? No, brother, it's the tragedy of who's in power. So let's let Justice run its course. - And the soul? - You did everything possible. Your Eminence, give me a little more time. - And who guarantees public order? - Me! I guarantee public order! - A few hours, Your Eminence. - Not. - By the way, I'll excuse you from the mission. - Not! - Go back to your Convent. - Not! - Obey. - Not! Your Eminence, no! Your Eminence...don't dismiss me! Outside! Outside! Make way for the Army! Go back to your homes! You mustn't stay here! Off! Off! Get out! Back! Did you see who it was? The Army is with us! Leo! Leonidas! Do not Cry. Whoever dies for freedom, dies for everyone. - I die for you too. - What do I care about freedom? I want to be a slave to a man. If he's a slave too, I don't care. Just be alive. Who wants it well, run after it. Don't feel sorry. Enough like this! Enough! - Sooner or later, we'll meet again. - To where? - Up there. - But do you believe? - No. - And then? Do you say that to comfort me? When can I console myself? Courage! Wait! Get out of the way! Sons! My children! It's over, there's no more salvation! He finished! There is no more hope! Repent ... If they don't do it for you, do it for me. What does it cost them? Don't do that, get up. It's losing its dignity. That friar again! And so? And I absolve them anyway. Stop him! Afterwards, I get along with the Eternal Father. I absolve you, in the name of ... Which is? Your Eminence, for charity! Not? Why? Because? Greetings and brotherhood. Stupid ... What is there to laugh about? - I was thinking of something fun. - Lucky you. On what? Ah, dear Master Titta, after the French Revolution... and of Napoleon's empire, what did the sovereigns gathered in Vienna do? They said: "Boys, today in the Bastille, nothing happened." "It returns to Louis XVI." And they put the wigs back on. Thus, they annulled everything, science, discoveries, inventions, everything... - everything but one thing. - What thing? The guillotine. Oh yes, it is an invention of you, of the revolutionaries. It's the only thing in the world today that doesn't smell of old, of decrepit, ... the guillotine. You are the most modern man in Rome. Master Titta, the future is yours! Good night people! "In memory of the Carbonari, Angelo Targhini and Leonida Montanari, ..." "whose sentence to death, ordered by the Pope without evidence and without defense,..." "in this square, serenely faced on November 23, 1825."
