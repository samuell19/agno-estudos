I had to ask for some reinforcements Yes, my uncle Louis will come. To take a break from his retirement on the island Does he know a lot about construction work? I don’t know, but I think two opinions are better than others, right? Yes Listen, I haven't found good coffee anywhere yet Excuse me? - at Willow Heaven. I've been here for almost three months now and nobody makes New York style coffee. Nobody - New York Style? The coffee here is very polite What do you mean? Okay... She stays in the cup waiting to drink it - What do you want her to do? I do not know I love the cup of coffee that hits me in the head and tells me: "Drink me!" Well, I'll get back to you on that Oh really? Yes, I may have anything to do with that Well, I hope someone has that because we have a problem Hello (robot) - Hello The surveillance cameras stopped working for about two minutes - Guess when that was - when the theft occurred - Yes - is there another angle? - No - How can two minutes ... From the observation video to disappear? - With the help of someone - Yes My uncle! - Here it is The newest police officer, Willow Heaven I wish I could still work there!

How glad I am to be here! Thank you So this is your house? You are making repairs to it Yes, I thought I would have gone further in the renovation process, but as you know ... Well, what is left on the to-do list? In front of us are floors, walls and ceiling restoration - Does the roof leak water? Only when it rains We have upstairs pipe fittings and basement pipe fittings And I have to re-paving both pigeons Have you done anything? - I repaired the sink Well, I have to go to work. I am glad you are here I will bring dinner to us and you act as if you were at home James Raisand Collection Thank you Hello mom . Hello dear Are you fine? - I'm fine - Do you need help with something? - We'll be fine. - Okay - Hello. - Hello Sorry, I was going to call you No, I came to check, I wanted to see how you are Well, James Ryesand holds my mom responsible for stealing last night in person He must have insurance to cover this Money isn't the problem, okay? The art community is very small and threatens to warn other artists From showing their products in the hall My mom worked hard to be the reputation she currently has And all of that might go unheeded with a word from James Raisand. Simply It is still early and the police have some evidence - They will find the contract - I hope so Because if they do not find it, this means that the hall will inevitably be closed Now, how does someone steal a contract from a locked box? Opening a lock with a tool? Our display boxes require a special key Opening the lock with a tool is assumed to be almost impossible - But not entirely impossible - not completely impossible, yes Who knows about this key too? Well, my mom and I are the security guard and ... And from? Someone we should talk to We closed the site and all guests were searched All of them? - In fact, there was time - Before we got there - the event was limited to invitations So there is a guest list But we have all the names on it Well, let's inquire from Raisand Whether he knows someone interested in the contract We will handle it And when you check the guest list Let's start with the guest who had a heart attack in a very timely manner As you want, President Do you want to keep the door open or close it? - I don't care - I will leave it open for air Yes Miss Edison told us that you were given the security key for the hall True, we removed one of the antiques from the display boxes Dagger, at James's request Did you ever leave the key? I brought it back to her right after using it The security guard was at the terminal with me the whole time Oh really? We talked to him But he could not confirm your whereabouts after the lights went out I can confirm that (Patrick) was by my side during the time of the robbery Garden coordinators are waiting to be paid Do you have any other questions? - I think we're done Certainly Investigators, no doubt you realize Every minute that passes makes the Stansbury Red necklace get away from us, which leads me to wonder Why are you in my house now? And you interrogate my brother while the time raid us? Well, since there are no eyewitnesses We have to expand the interrogation department A hall full of people and no one has seen anything. This is incredible! Please do not come too close. This is a Macedonian masterpiece from the fourth century Mr. Raisand, the insurance agent on the phone Help me (Rebecca) will provide you with any information you need You can know anything Detective (Acosta) - Yes? The contract is unique, irreplaceable - I have to get it back - we're working on that - Don't touch it. - Yes - Yes, touching is forbidden. - What do you do? Stop@! It is from the fourth century . Do not touch it (Greg Ricard) worked as a security guard at the showroom for six months He used to come late and sleep at work , so my mother fired him So, he knows the hall planner, its security features, and unattended sites Yes, and with an opportunity to earn some money and destroy my mom's reputation? - He must be the one. - What's your plan then? You go up there and see if he just stole the contract? I can distinguish when someone lies to me This is a great idea Thank you - but I have a better idea He had a motive, let's see if he had a chance Hey, I'm looking for Grave Richards. Ricard. I'm here to take a new badge photo He didn't tell me I wanted anything about the new badges - This is management print. - Sorry, I have no time today Well, please let you know that I will not be able to return here three weeks ago I hope he won't get angry too much. I know he wanted to do this quickly Do you know? I can save a minute of my time Excellent, I can catch it here if you don't mind - Is this a suitable place? - Yes, just move aside a little Then go back a little Excellent (Griff), we need you at the boat dock. - I'm just taking the picture of the new badge - "What new badge?" Remind me of your name? Warning at platform three It took too long - Try to find a boat - It has an alarm - people trust others a lot these days Griff's shift was that day from four until midnight This does not mean that there was only that he was supposed to be there True, but it is a strong case for absence I am not saying that he is not the actor, all I am saying is ... Perhaps we should widen the circle of suspicion Well, with about 100 guests, guests, artists, and service providers? It will be a big circle - Are you sure this is the place? - Yes, 22 Mr. White, we are from Willow Heaven Police. Hello? Mr. White? Do you know? The price of the event ticket was $ 1,000 This does not look like a rich person's home Well, even if he was, he didn't spend much on coordinating his garden I see Hey, madam Hello, excuse me - Are you from the neighborhood? I live in four houses The house has green windows Do you know someone named Arthur White? - I do not remember a name like this are you sure? Because he lives here No one has lived in this house for years Yes big smile Here you are (Margaret), how many years ago have I been taking your picture of the university annual book? Since I became an academic supervisor Do you think it's time for us to try something different? - different? - Yes, you know, something ... - Less strict - I don't know I want to present myself positively Well, nothing gives a more positive first impression than the strong character What do you think about trying to live more seriously? this is what I want "Picture Perfect" Studio What is that? I thought that if I displayed the photos from the event like this, it would give us a timeline The camera stopped shooting, but you did not die - Good. - So where do we start? good morning Aren't you old enough to make photomontages? We are reviewing pictures from the showroom We are trying to narrow the charge circuit - We are trying to arrest a thief - Well, then you two ... - To start from here. - Why? who is she? - She is the woman who stole the contract - and how did she know that? She was staring at the contract all night and said it was a family inheritance Did you know her name? - Gwendlin? - Noah Can your mother give us a copy of the guest list? Yes Mr. White's invitation was sent to an abandoned house You should have been with him to enter the event that night Oh really? - (White) Most likely a pseudonym Most likely - which means the person is required It has a name that we do not know and an address we do not have We have to know who received that message And how he entered the list of invitees in the first place Right No! - Nice to see you! - Hello - No, no, no! - Louis! - How are you, Nick? how are you my friend? - Nice to see you, man - Well - Hello, what ... what are you doing here? - I brought you lunch Okay. - Acosta. Oh really? - Yes, by habit - President , did you ask for support? No, no, he's about to leave. You're about to leave, right? Mr. Acosta, I'm glad to see you - I'm glad to see you, President. - Okay Did the forensic detective bring us any clues about the showroom thief? Not yet, there were some fingerprints on the display box So we will check it through our system and see what we get - Theft - yes In fact, a contract was stolen from the midnight showroom. Even if White is the thief, he needs a partner To enter the security room only two people have entry cards Yes, Miss Edison and the security guard, just Have any of the two cards been left unattended? - They were carrying them all the time. - Did you check with Carmichael? From? - (Gavin Carmichael) We arrested him more than once for pickpocketing The most skilled thefts you can see in your life Until he became a theft practitioner at a higher level, he spent three years in state prison Two years with good behavior, so it is possible that ... Conditionally released - Good view - Do you have anything for me? - Yes, an apple I really miss you, my friend Follow mrs The Joker does not gain anything, watch the Queen and this may be your happy day Against your bet, man are you sure? This is your last chance This is unfortunate. Next time, who will want to try? I will try - Get here. - Sorry Can you help me find the Sinclair Museum? It looks like I'm a little lost - Of course - it's somewhere here Focus on your loot So how much do you bet? A moment of your time over there You can cross the bridge No, no, from here, in fact, Highland Street is crowded At this time in the day, you better go to Hunter Street Hunter? Where is Hunter? Excuse me a little my arm! I told you that he would run away - Move - I grabbed it Okay List of invitees brought But the name (Gwendlin) is not on her I was at home watching the match Yes, the Socks team had a bad luck that I thought they could win They won, they scored the winning goal in the ninth round Yes - so I was home all night Can anyone confirm this? - My wife (Sherry) She finished her shift at six and stayed home until she left in the morning Have you heard of "midnight"? - The time? - No, the art gallery Someone stole there, they stole a contract Listen, I no longer do this, I learned my lesson I had a wife and a job, and I became straight Oh really? Why do you play card games in the park then? I don't keep any money from it No? No I give all the money to the animal shelter - He's like Robin Hood - but with dogs - Yes, something like that - Tell me, then, why did you run? Difficult to get rid of old habits - for sure A solid case of absence, he reviews the officer responsible for his conditional release twice a month But you are not ready to exclude it yet It is consistent with his style, it would be nice to prove his presence in the region I think I might know someone who can help "Picture Perfect" Studio Everything was filmed at night Thank you very much . Is there any evidence? - Little - like? Why are you hunting for information? Natural curiosity You know what they say, curiosity killed the cat Yes, but satisfying curiosity brought it back to life Everyone forgets this part - That's good. - Yes, I'm just trying to help I helped enough Thank you . So, you know the former guard The "midnight" hall, which has a motive for revenge and knows the plan of the place? (Griff Rickard) Yes, we got the excuse for his absence this morning Are you sure of it? Do you know? Are you free on Saturday? - Saturday ... - You promised me coffee - Right, yes - then, on Saturday You can choose the place Okay . Okay. Okay See you then Hello - This was Detective Acosta, right? Yes Are there developments in the case? Any clues or similar? I think I have a romantic date I think I heard you say you think you have an emotional appointment Would you please bring me my phone? Thanks, Margaret, her name is Gwendelin Cox. Why weren't on the guest list? - Maybe she was accompanying one of the guests - and found it She is a contract lawyer working in the city center (Stanford), (Rhodes) is Professor of Greenpeace. Not a CV for a thief Yes, but that may explain it While I was researching the contract, I found that Raisand bought it at last spring's auction The bid was tough and I'll let you guess who defeated him Well, then ... Riesand stole the contract from Gwendlin. - So I stole it from him - Yes, but how did you get it out? - Everyone was searched - No, not everyone Gwendlin and her partner left with Mr. White. Before anyone knew of the loss of the contract Do we know the name of her boyfriend? The name may have it This is it, this is it No comment, tag, or name on the photo I think I have another way - Five in the morning - I decided to let you sleep until late How do you like eggs? Crawford Inn. Hello - What do I do for you? Five minutes of your time, if so please Of course - Is Gavin Carmichael your husband? - Yes - Was (Gavin) with you Friday evening? - About ten o'clock in the evening - Yes, he was with me ... Is my husband in trouble? - Not yet - No, no trouble He said you stayed home and saw some movies Is that correct? Maybe He was still watching the match when he was brought to bed Excellent, thank you Watch the game - Their narratives are identical - he may have reached it before us I think we should monitor it This is me, we have to talk I only have two months left But I can't live without you, Cynthia. Her boyfriend was Thomas Wake. - Hey, did she tell you that? - No, I have a friend checking the license plates - The cute policeman? No... We are not ... This friend cannot do that. He works as a private investigator He photographed his personal picture of his narration about a real crime Well, then Thomas Wake Yes, he sold his startup two years ago to millions So he will not need to steal the contract However, he lost half of that money in bad investments The other half is on the gambling table So do we think it helped her? Or maybe it was just a means of entry for her But he would have gained a lot from stealing the contract, so ... There is one way to find out - Well, maybe nobody is in the house - his car is in the entrance Well, but this is the home of someone who has at least three cars Well, he might evade us Hello Hi, I was hoping you could help us We are from "Better Homes" magazine and report on Mr. Wake's house. He was supposed to meet us here for a photo session, but he didn't answer - The best houses? Yes I'm pictured, see? Mr. Wake didn't tell me anything about that You know, I think it's because of his extreme humility He didn't want to say anything Mr. Wick is modest? Now you're sure you're lying Go here before I call the police - "The magazine of the best houses"? - This usually works Well, we need a better excuse Well, we're a real estate broker who's overly excited - Or two lost tourists - Yes, we can speak with a strange accent - Yes, don't do that. - What? I am good at accents Good day, Mr. Addison. No Listen ... well, now what? Well, we'll go to the door and ... I don't know. I don't know. I'm just improvising, okay? What is that? - Anyone? - Ma'am, are you all right? Yes, I do not hear anything Her voice seemed to be in trouble - We have to go. - Noah. What? Hush Well, you go from here and I will go from there Okay Hello? Is everything alright? - Don't go into the kitchen. - Why? - Mr. Wake? What about Mr. Wake? He is dead Willow Heaven Forensic Office Miss Adams, will you tell me why you are at another crime scene? No, most likely. - Did you two report it? We were here when the maid found him what happened? - Blow with a blunt object on the back of the head Listen, Miss (Phillips) will go to the police station to give her statement I think we are lucky that she did not clean half the crime scene - Before you found the body - No, it seems that someone preceded it We face problems lifting fingerprints of anything Excellent, and now we need advice - Officer , I don't know anything So it won't take long - And you, my friend too - am I? Yes Officer? Ma'am, this is a crime scene. I can't let you be here I know I have something that I think you will want to see My surveillance camera depicts the front of this house Here I don't recognize the person but ... I only stayed five minutes at home But she did not ask the taxi to wait As if she did not expect that she would leave so quickly I watched the rest of the night, no one else entered Not at least the front door. Can you go back a little? Okay Can a criminal detective get a clearer picture of this? No need You are not allowed to be here I know who this is police station" How long have you been in your relationship? Two months, we met at an auction We bid on the same plate, I won and he paid for dinner - Nice - I don't know why anyone would want to harm him Have you attended the "Midnight" lounge? - He got an invitation. - And you? I was his friend, Thomas knows ... I mean Patrick Ryzand knew a lesson at the same school You know, we have a surveillance camera video where you appear as you leave the house that night It looked very urgent It's not what you think . What do I think? - I killed him - And did I? No! - I loved him - So, why did you get the taxi to go? We were planning a late dinner after the event He promised me that he would cook for me But when he returned home he was ... Cool It was confusing, as if it were someone else Did you fight? He told me that he no longer wanted to date me It was a mistake, and he asked me to leave so I left - Do you believe her? - Did he break her heart? Yes, it was convincing as well as a good reason to leave quickly Yes, motivated to kill He defended the murder Stealing big jewelry? Every mysterious puzzle needs a name - No, we wouldn't call it that way - I think it's an attractive name I voted for the name of "stolen contract" Well, you are not helping me Maya, why is your picture on the board? Because I'm part of the puzzle now This photo was taken two years ago when I auditioned for a local stage show - "The Baskerville" - Did you get the role? I am still waiting How did it go with Thomas? Did he speak? - No - he is dead I think we should take his picture off the board Well, he was alive when the contract was stolen Do you think the two crimes are related to each other? I do not know But someone on this board knows (Flour) ... (Flour), (Flour) what do you have? I finally got to the guest list and I'm checking their historical records Most of them only had speed violations, but one of them was prominent Mr. Clint Baxter has no criminal record, but I hear that He has been involved in two cases of theft in the past three years Oh really? Maybe we should visit Mr. Baxter then Okay Nice boat, 30 feet? - 31 - It must have cost you a lot My marriage was profitable and my divorce was more profitable Can I help you with something? We are Willow Heaven Police and we wanted to ask you Some questions about the exhibition in the "midnight" lounge - Do you want a drink? no thanks I'll take one Last December, you were interrogated about ... A stolen masterpiece from the Heisenberg Museum Yes, you were in the wrong place at the wrong time - I went through this a few times. - Yes But you were also interrogated about a private diamond theft case I was acquitted in both cases I am mixing rich people, gentlemen They surround themselves with valuables I hope you don't assume that I have a relationship - The missing contract. - No. But you were in the hall on the night he was stolen I was there after that too, as one of your men searched me Careful inspection Mr. Baxter, is everything all right? I think the two officers were about to leave - Yes, we are about to leave. - We will leave, thanks I don't know how to work in New York, but at Willow Heaven. - Do not drink during working hours - this is not mine I thought that the lab might need new fingerprints Now we will set another date to take the photo Detective Acosta! How do you get so accurate? It is only the wide lens Then you choose a focus in the background I'll get some coffee, do you want something? - No thanks. - Okay - Chipboard! - What about you, man? - No thanks. - Okay I'll be out for five minutes, maybe ten Have you ever shown any of these in the showroom? No, but Camille wants me to present works for her show So I will do when I take the right picture to me) I have seen him Will you now tell me to leave the investigation to you? Are you going to pretend you didn't hear what you said? Sorry, listen ... I just came to check on you You know, getting into a crime scene by accident is emotionally heavy Is it normal for the police to come and check on the safety of people? I am not here as a policeman, I will hide this badge I'm here as a friend only Thank you No, I'm fine, we're fine, thanks Good, I guess I have to give you my number - If you are ... - No, he is with me Well, yes, then ... But it's good to know that I can use it I will leave now - Patrick Ryisand - James's brother I did some research on their family history We found that they were fighting a legal battle For years since their parents died The family's property was worth millions and left it all to James. It must have been painful But Patrick works with James . He works for him As a token of peace, Patrick was given a role in the brokerage firm My mom said that the safety key was with Patrick that night Well, he was standing next to James when the theft happened - I saw him. - Maybe he gave it to someone? Well, a younger brother has a motive for revenge He steals the most precious belongings of his older brother Patrick runs the family property, Taber Farm. - Tapper's farm? - (Tapper) is a name - Their mother's family - no, no, no I know Tapper's farm. We filmed weddings there - It's beautiful - unfortunately, you are not filming one now Mr. Raisand will share with you in a few moments . Thank you Can I give you something to drink? Water or soda? - No, thanks - Okay, I'll take ... No, we do not want anything Yes, we do not want anything These are beautiful pictures, did you shoot any of them? I do not know maybe Rogers and Carter's wedding, Peter and Bishop's wedding. - This was in the hall that night - Who is it? I don't know, but I recognized his face - That was your responsibility. - I understand. "I don't care that you understand." "Tell me why should I trust you after what happened that night" - I apologize for the delay - No, it's okay I know you, right? Allie Adams Of course, I was in the hall that night at James's Gallery. Yes, there you are So now you're filming Fisher and Manning's wedding. Exactly, yes, and thanks for giving us some of your time We have a client who has many exacting requirements that we must meet I am glad to help you Question, I know this person, is he (Ryan Sullivan)? No, it's Clint Baxter. Mistaken, it may be its twin You see, he's a luxury guy He only met a social milieu and was able to enter it in his charming style You do not seem fascinated by it He stole something precious from me, my fiancée Their marriage did not last long and after they got divorced He took half of her fortune so, I guess the last laugh was on me Yes, this is the psychological required So, where do you want to start? - Noah, come on - Specifications required for a wedding? Yes I have to download the file from the internet What is the wireless internet password here? It's amazing how much you can tell from someone's phone when you use the same internet this is scary I thought she was helping him No phone calls, no emails No letters to the police or the insurance company? Or for his brother Got all this by using his internet? Suddenly, I felt like I wanted to put my phone in a drawer and lock it for the rest of my life He didn't make any calls after 15:10 The time to steal a contract His brother's timeless masterpiece was stolen and no contact was made? Maya lost her favorite purple jacket last week and called 50 times It suits everything! Perhaps he was shocked Maybe it wasn't - President - (Sam), Gavin Carmichael's file I checked it in advance, and recorded the case for his absence Take a look at the arrest report - Who led him to prison? No His first misdemeanor two years ago He was arrested for picking up at the port - The victim - (Thomas Wake) I will take over He did not change his sayings about the excuse of his absence saying that he was at home all night The time of theft and the time of the murder do you believe that? I do not know When I told him that Thomas Wake had died, he seemed surprised Terrified I think this is harmful by water You have to hire someone to check for mold How much will it cost me to fix something like this? If there is mold in this wall, you will not clean it, you will destroy it Would this still be considered the process of repairing a house if it didn't fix anything? (Automated): coffee on Saturday at 6:00. Good news? Yes Yes I was following an issue Sam, how is this midnight case going? - It's good - I can take a look at it - If you want a new perspective - no, no, no - I take care of it the same, thank you. - Okay I think it's time to install the new tap Well, I guess she's in a box in the living room Okay did you find it? - I found this (Gabriel Russell) You told me you left this case, Sam. You said you left (New York) because you want to start a new beginning Yes, I want that So, why bring the past with you?

Or in both Perhaps the motive for killing Thomas Wake was that she broke her heart Perhaps he knew about the contract and threatened to report it Or he works with her and we have a classic case of betrayal You don't understand, Philip, I have nothing to lose Nothing but my heart I can try it another way if you like No, thanks, I think we got what we wanted - Okay - it says here that you are good Dual dance This is really written here We'll make you read your turn in front of the person we chose to play the role of grandfather Certainly Where is my signal?

Yes Her name was (Gabriel Russell) she was working on a case Criminals linked to the mafia attacked a store It should have been an easy case, right? But she wanted to reach out to the big bosses She wanted to arrest them, which made everyone nervous Did not reach the trial Her car was found under a water dam The ballasts were cut We never found the body There were no witnesses and no physical evidence was washed away When the evidence did not find anything, the Chamber closed the case and the matter was over - But not for you - she devoted her life to justice I could not do justice to her Three unidentified bodies appeared, used my influence, obtained the files, and ...

Do you know? I have been asking myself this question since we met No, I mean, what will happen at the dock at ten o'clock? I received confidential information When it comes to an important contract like this there are very few people who can transfer it secretly Didn't you think of telling the police about this? I am not used to revealing my sources The police can also read the details in the afternoon's copy of the newspaper - This is if the people waiting for them come - No, not if they come, but when they come She has an outrageous habit of appearing on crime scenes As if she can not leave things alone If I hadn't been acquainted with the matter, I would have said that it was seeking problems Like someone I know No, no, it's different, okay? - That's my job - smart You do not recognize her intelligence as it should I am just trying to protect her By trying to keep it away from you, by keeping everyone away from you You will feel very alone if you continue to do so 11 oclock I thought they hesitated?

I was in the swimming team Well, well, we have to go We have to go I want a lawyer I will tell you anything you want to know When Patrick Ryisand decided to steal his brother's precious masterpiece. "He was the first to call him (Clint Baxter)" Baxter was known for delivering precious holdings. "Because you cannot write on your business card that you are a professional thief." The second person to call is Thomas Wake. "An old schoolmate needs to improve his finances." And in his frantic quest for the contract (Gwendelin Cox) was perfect for them. Thomas hired (Gavin Carmichael) to pick up a Camille card. "Having tried his skills on his own" And they knew the layout and arrangement of the place from (Gregck Ricard) (Clint) brought him to the operation after he learned of his dispute with the "midnight" lounge. "Everything had to be done on time in order for this process to succeed." "The power outages gave them less than a minute of disciplined mess." "But that was enough for someone like (Clint)." (Alexander Brecki), the actor who I think was hired "To perform an artistic performance, provide additional distraction." And a way to smuggle the contract without anyone noticing "By paramedic bag" "All they had to do now was clear their traces." "Patrick and Clint stayed to make sure that they were interrogated and searched." By the police and thus reinforce the argument of their absence. The paramedic removed the contract from the hall without realizing it. "(Griff) and (Gavin) fled the contract without anyone seeing them." - And Thomas Wake? - Make a decisive mistake - He fell in love - Beginners' mistake Thomas couldn't continue the trick to fabricate the charge for Gwendlin. And when he didn't come to the secret meeting, they sent Clint to inspect him He entered through the back door in order not to raise suspicions (Thomas) told him that he wanted to withdraw and he killed him. After years of theft from those in power and influence, He knew exactly how to leave a crime scene without a trace. - Please - thanks How are you doing? Much better Listen, I'm so glad you're fine Well, thanks to you for that Did you find the missing contract? - Yes, we found it - Good The diver found it very quickly And James Raisand's help here, I've got to know the contract and we can go I think we will all be happy with it I think there is only one station left , Detective Investigators, I did not think that you would come to hand me the contract in person No, we are not here to deliver the contract, Mr. Raisand, but to take something I don't think I understand you Well, you will have a long time to think about on the way to the center - James Ryesand, you're under arrest . What charge? Let's start from fraud and start from there You have the right to remain silent and anything you say can be used against you in court You are entitled to a lawyer So, James Riesand stole the contract from himself? He was the mastermind of the whole process He had a ten million dollar insurance he hoped to get This is an insurance scam And buyers from the black market from outside the country And so he would get twice the value We can say that any damage Raisand inflicted on your reputation will not last I do not know how to thank you Both of you, what do you think about dinner? on my bill Can we delay it?
