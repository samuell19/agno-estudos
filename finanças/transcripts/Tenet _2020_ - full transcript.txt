take the Americans away. The Opera We live in a twilight world. We live in a twilight world. - And there are no friends in the twilight. The attack is a covering maneuver to stop you. I have contacted. - Do you join or do you want to die? I have two minutes. Decide. Where's the package? - In the closet. Stay there. Take yours! What are you doing? What are you doing? Who are you? No friends in the twilight? - You go. Take it to the meeting place. Changing clothes. Ukrainians hope there will be a passenger. That type of enclosure is new. - The age is unknown, but it is real. Did you have a resort? - A tunnel to the sewer. Take this. Take it. Take your resource. Can you neutralize it? It is controlled remotely. There is more? - They cover themselves. Should the audience die? That is not our mission. - Now it's mine. It's risky. Or did you put your trust in this one? Death.. It's CIA equipment. Go Go Go ! Is not the! You can train people to hold out for about 18 hours, - - so that your companions are out of danger in. Seven. It didn't last 18 minutes. He had nothing to hide. You are dealing with an insignificant person. It's risky. Or did you put your trust in this one? Death. It's CIA equipment. Protect yourself when out of danger. It's almost seven o'clock. It goes too fast. We have to delay an hour. Away with it! Welcome to the afterlife. you out of Ukraine and recreated your mouth. Suicidal players are fake. Why? It's a test. - A test? My teeth were pulled out. Was my team safe? No. Russian mercenaries, we think. Someone has gossiped. But not you. You chose to die for the sake of your colleagues. We all believe that we will find a building on fire. But until we can feel the heat of the flames, then we won't know. You do that. I leave. - You don't work for us. You are dead. Their duty exceeds national considerations. It's about survival. And? Everything. We are in the middle of a cold war. And frozen war. If you know the true nature of war, you have lost it. All knowledge is divided. All I have for you is a sign ... combined with a word. "Beginning". Be carefull with that. It opens the right doors, but also some of the wrong ones. Have they not told you otherwise? The test you passed? Not everyone passes it. You can enter virtually anywhere with a yellow vest and clipboard. . Virtually. - A dark maxim. No small talk. Nothing that can reveal who we are and what we do. Shouldn't you find out what we do? Not "what", but "how". "What", that's your department. That's none of my business. In order to do what I do, I need to know something about the threat. As I understand it, we are trying to prevent World War III. Nuclear war? No. Something worse. Take aim and pull the trigger. The magazine is empty. - Vision. Look at the magazine. How? One of these bullets is like us. Move forward in time. The other moves back. Can you see which is which? Now what? It is reversed. Its entropy moves backwards. In our eyes, it is moving backwards. We think it is reverse radiation caused by fission. Have you not succeeded? - We still don't know how. So where does it come from? - Someone makes them in the future. And then they flow towards us. Try it yourself. You must have lost it. How can it move? - From his point of view, he took advantage of it. But from a bullet point of view, you lost it. - The cause precedes the effect. The ball moved because you brought your hand there. But what about free will? The ball moved because you brought your hand there. Whichever way the tape rolls, you made it happen. Don't try to understand it. Feel it. Instinct. I'm in. Why does it feel so strange? You don't fire the bullet ... you grab it. I've seen this type of ammunition before. - In the countryside? They almost hit me. - Then she was very lucky. If an inverted bullet passes through one, it is catastrophic. It's not pretty. They seem contemporary. - They can be from now on and reversed later. Where do you get them from? - They were on the wall. I have it assigned, like everything I study here. Do you have a metal analysis? - Yes. Why? The alloy mix could tell me where they have been made. Listen... It doesn't seem like the end of the world. The ball is a simple machine. A lead ball, a brass casing, gunpowder. If they can invest it, then they can invest anything. Even an atomic bomb can only affect our future. An inverted weapon can also affect our past. Now that we know what to look for, we find more and more reversed material. Remnants of complex objects. What do you think we are seeing here? Eroded remnants of an impending war. Yep? - We live in a twilight world. There are no friends in the twilight. You had passed away. Even the dead need allies. - More specifically? I need to locate Sanjay Singh in Mumbai. Singh? He never leaves his house, and his house is ... his house. Yes. I'm looking at it now. - I'm checking who's ready. Bombay Yacht Club in two hours. You have demonstrated the need to be introduced to a prominent Mumbai citizen. My name is Neil. - I need to meet Sanjay Singh. It can not be done. - Ten minutes maximum. It is not the moment the problem. The problem is coming to life from there. Could you take a child hostage? A woman? If I were forced to. I don't want to make noise. Yes? - Vodka tonic. And a light tail. Than? You never drink in the toilet. - You are well informed. It is useful in our industry. - I prefer apollinaris. No you don't. Are you good at skydiving? - I broke my ankle during training. Singh's house is not high enough for a trampoline. You can bungee jump. - You can't say "bungee jump". Maybe not, but it may be our only recourse. And enter. I know you are tired. I also. Gone. I was almost killed by a type of ammunition unusual in Ukraine. I want to know who delivered it. My name is Sanjay. Who are you? We do not talk? - There is no one to help you. Eat before it gets cold. Why should I know who it is? The combination of metals originates from India and you control everything here. Good guess. - Deduction. Okay, a deduction. Listen, friend. Guns do not provide a productive negotiation. - I'm not the dealer. Or the one who makes appointments. But I'm the one people talk to. Or the one who makes appointments. But I'm the one people talk to. You are an arms dealer, my friend. The trigger is easy to press. Revealing something about a client would go against their maxims. If maximizing is important to you, please let me know. All. Not while I'm threatening my husband with a gun. Sanjay, serve a drink for our guest. Salud. Priya. This is your business? A man as a front figure is helpful. The arms dealer is named Andrei Sator. - The Russian oligarch. Do you know him? - Not personal. He's a gas billionaire. Moved to London. He must be furious with Moscow. Penalty fee. But the gas with which the billions are made is in fact plutonium. But why did you sell him reverse ammo? When I sold them to them, they were normal. How did you get them so invested? We believe that it is a kind of mediator between our time and the future. Can you communicate with the future? - We can all do that. Email, credit cards, text messages. Everything that is preserved for posterity speaks to the future. But can the future answer us? - And do I have to find out? To get close to Sator you have to be a fresh new protagonist. And you are as cool as a summer meadow. Get closer to him. Find out what you get and how. Can I get MI6 involved? - I have a contact, Sator can't get there. You must have had a plan to escape. Not one that I love. Can I help with something? - I have a breakfast agreement with mr. Crosby. They are probably referring to Sir Michael Crosby. - Finally, assume that. Follow this path. I start eating. I hope you are good. It will probably reach you. The same please. - I'm sending the waiter here. No. Just transmit the order. You are interested in a Russian. An English Russian. I have to be careful. Yes. She has contacts in MI6. I said he fills them with shit. But they don't care. - Talk to me about him. I guess you know the secret cities of the Soviet era. Secret cities built around sensitive industries. Most are now open and ordinary cities. - Not the one Sator grew up on. Stalsk 12. In the 1970s there were about 200,000. It was thought to be abandoned. - Abandoned? An accident of some kind. It was then used for underground tests. Two weeks ago, the same day of the attack on the opera, ... - We discovered an explosion in northern Siberia, right where Stalsk Sator appeared from this hole in the map ... with ambitions and money to buy his entrance into the British establishment. Through his wife? - Katherine Barton. Niece of Sir Bartons. She works at Shipley's. Happily married? - Practically divorced. How do I approach Sator? - Through her. You have too much confidence in my seductive abilities.. Only. We have a trump card up our sleeve. You have a Goya in a Harrods bag. It is a forgery made by a Spaniard named Arepo. One of two we seized from a scammer in Bern. What about the other? Vino en Shipley's. Katherine Barton confirmada authenticity. Smoked for sale. And who do you think bought it? - Her husband? Does she know it's fake? - It's hard to say. It is rumored that she and Arepo were closely linked. No offense... But when you pretend to be a billionaire ... Brooks Brothers is not good enough. I guess I have to stick to a budget. - Save the world and we'll fix the box later. Can I recommend a tailor? - I'll be fine. The British do not have a monopoly on snobbery. - No, it's not a monopoly. Most actions. Can I order to have it in a box? - Certainly not. Goodbye, Sir Michael. How I can help? I have not been notified of any appointments, sir .... Mr. Goya? No. I heard you're a Goya expert. No , i'm talking about person see it , about Goya How unusual. How much does it cost? There is a lot to do before the evaluation. Provenance, microscopic examination, X-ray photography. But what does your heart tell you? Who do you get the drawing from? - Tomas Arepo. I bought my Goya at a low price from an annoying Swiss banker. I tracked him down to Arepo and realized he had marked the box, - - when he told me who paid well for another of his paintings. Your husband. - How did you write down the box? Your drawing is a fake. - A good fake. You know better than anyone. I rate the box to the best of my knowledge. Did you know that I cheated on my husband? We are in related industries, but it is difficult to talk to him. If we made a deal ... - Deal? You mean blackmail. You should not be afraid of the word. He is not my husband. Sorry, but he got you in advance. You know, but you haven't done anything? Why should I do it? - He gave nine million. Hardly what it provided for our forced vacation. - Were you on Mars? Vietnam on our yacht. Yacht Hans. You have the right suit. And the shoes and the watch. But you are in deep water. People who have fortunes like the one your husband - in general, they don't like to be fooled. Drawing gives him power over me. He threatened me with the police. Prison. All. It controls me. Contact with my son. Everything. It would never have been easy to quit , but now it is impossible. You cannot fight back You can only beg him.t. I tried to love him again. I thought he would want to give me my son again. We sat in the damn boat and watched the sunsets. - and imitated happier moments. He seemed happy so I asked him and he made me an offer. He wanted to let me go, but then I never had to see my son again. I told him how I felt and got Max ashore. He called completely guilt-ridden. But then I saw another woman jump out of the boat and then she disappeared. I was so jealous. - You don't seem like the jealous type. I envied him his freedom. I dream of jumping out of that boat. But you have a child together. This is my life now. Did you know that the drawing was fake? - No. Tomás and I became close relatives. Maybe too close. I failed. In Andrei's world, you can't go wrong. Just betray. But I didn't betray him. Maybe I missed my chance. - And set Arepo free. If you had really met Arepo, you would know that he won't go anymore We talk together on the phone. - He can't do that either. Where is the drawing? - Why do you ask? Let me know and then I remove the drawing from the equation. No image, no judgment, no power over you. Maybe I am your chance. - I don't need to be saved. Betray him. Your husband's friends Did you know this would happen? - Do not worry. They don't kill you. Andrei will not interact with the police at that level. You must have hated my appearance. - There's nothing wrong with that. I have to get on to the ugly part before I start worrying about the outcome. You don't pick up the phone. Maybe I'm surprising you. I ordered my chili sauce an hour ago. Can we drive now?? Can't we do enough? - He wants you to see it. And you get what you want. Obviously not always. Anna says we're going to Pompeii to look at lava. Yes. We will go there together. I'm going too. I said you would be surprised. Cute boy. - He is my everything. Where is the drawing? Oslo. In the airport. - The airport? Do you know what Freeport is? An art store that's been bought ... - But not taxed yet. We founded a network. They were built by the Rotas company and I came with the clients. The facilities are tax havens. Clients can inspect their investments without import them, so they avoid the tax. A kind of transit room for art? Art, antiques, everything of value. - Everything? Everything that is legal. - It is reminiscent of Swiss banks. Not transparent. Most of Freeport's plants are just warehouses, - - but here we make sure you can enjoy ... Rotas has securities at Freeporten in Oslo. It's probably there. This path to the space of values. Enough? - Enough? We go four or five times a year. Visit art? - And whatever I do. Art means nothing to Andrei. But so do the Freeport facilities. The structure of the rooms of value is like that of the Pentagon. Each room is a separate construction. If one building is damaged, the others remain. Fire-fighting equipment Some customers choose biometric access control. You can enter directly ... from the track. From the terminal? From your private plane. - Of course. Our logistics department can deliver between any Free port installation without customs control. What do you hope to find there? - You want to know? I'm not sure about that. - Bring lead-lined gloves. Cross. Nuclear weapons. When they show you around, observe fire fighting measures. Documents are vulnerable to ... - Fire? No, water damage to sprinkler systems. We do not use sprinklers. The system is filled with halogen gas, which displaces all the air in a few seconds. Can you show me that? - Then we'd suffocate. And the personal? - Gas is only in valuables. They just have to go out into the corridors and are notified ten seconds before. At least they have ten seconds. People choose us because we do n't prioritize nothing higher than your possessions. OMG. The doors are fire retardant. They are hydraulic. Simple locks and electronic triggers. Surprisingly easy when closed. Why should it be closed? - The exterior doors close automatically. But the interiors are back to factory settings. Locks can break. It is baby food. Baby food? She's in a safe airport. They must control the indoor climate, not prevent attacks. How to attack with enough force to shut down the system? The back wall. - Do you have an idea? You will not like it. Do you want to smash it with a plane? Not from the air. Now not so dramatic. I want to drive a plane from the runway through the wall and start a fire. How big is an airplane? That part is a bit dramatic. It's Mahir. His team fixes the plane. No passengers. - Norsk charge. They use the hangar west of Freeporten. - A transport plane? And the crew? We threw them down the emergency slides. - On my way? What is the problem? They are doing well. It seems quite daring. "Bold" is fine. I thought you would say "crazy". What if they take you? - We do not. What if it does? Everyone will assume it is terror, but without the dead, - - then an expulsion and we disappear into the system. It hardly appears in the news. It depends on the size of the explosion. - Gold bars can attract attention. Gold bars? - Norwegian Freight transports gold. Blow up the rear. Throw the gold on the catwalk. Nobody wants to look at the building. I promise. The space in the middle of the pentagon is too large. There must be something there. I can not figure it out. It is not included in any drawing. 45 seconds. - Much. Shouldn't you run at the same time? Okay, it's your turn. Start packing. Go through the detector. The Knight. And them. Do you want coffee? Water? - In espresso. And them? - No thanks. Is everyone on the plane vegetarian? There is only vegetarian food here. It looks like meat, but ... They both look vegetarian. I do not know. It's confusing. Okay. In this way, gentlemen. Your valuable space. Follow. Not the radio. Come. Come. Come on! Now! Let's go Okay. You said ten seconds, right? There is someone here with us. Need help? - Currently, yes. Don't touch them! - What the hell happened here? It has not happened yet. Do not kill him! We need to know if we have been exposed. Why are you here? Who are you? How did you know we wanted to be here? We will. What happened to the other one? I took care of it. Now I have seen too much. I'm still alive so you have to trust me. Or I have fallen in love with her. - No, you're still sitting there. A Cold War is taking place. - Nuclear war? A time war. Time travel? - No. Technology that can reverse the entropy of an object. Like Feynman and Wheeler's idea that a positron goes back in time? Yes, exactly. - I have a master's degree in physics. Try to be up to date. - It must mean that this is ... More than secret. - So why are you involving me? I thought we would find a drawing and some bullets. It surprises me even more. - I'll look for answers in Mumbai. You can be a middle man, but remember that for yourself ... it is plutonium. And when we're done, they'll kill you. - Aren't you going to do it anyway? I prefer to decide for myself. - I also want that. I think so. Is this your job? What did you find in the rooms of value? Two antagonists. One was reversed. We fixed the normal one, but the inverted ran away. Did they appear at the same time? - Yes. It was the same person. Sator has built a lock there. - A lock? An inverting machine. You said technology hasn't been invented yet. True. He has it from the future. - Why? You have the best chance of finding out. Did you meet him? - I was close. What if you have something missing? - I like it? Plutonium-241. Sator tried to get something from a CIA team at the Kiev Opera. It hit the team. Not the plutonium. Who did it? - The security police of Ukraine. Smoke Tallinn in a week. Helping an arms dealer steal plutonium is unacceptable, Priya. I'm killing it. - No. Sator must stay alive.. Until we understand your role in this. Take advantage of the situation without losing the plutonium. It is too dangerous. A terrorist bomb doesn't care what happens if we don't stop Sator. What do you want? - We will be attacked from the future. And Sator helps them. You need to know how. I saw the news about Oslo. Do you have the drawing? You don't have to think about it anymore. - Did you destroy it? I didn't think you would want it again. - He knows? Not yet. Wait a minute. - Wait a minute? Every day my son is with the monster, he hates me more. It doesn't last long. Introduce me. Like what? - Previously worked at the Embassy in Riyadh. We get together for a party in June. - It probably wasn't in June. June 29. 7pm or 7.30pm. Salmon was on the menu, but bars were served. Sator left early. Then we met. I walked into Shipley's in London. He found me here and would like to show me the yacht. He will think we are having an affair. - Then he will meet me. Or get you killed. - Let me worry about that. Did I look worried? There is room for 70 with crew. Two helicopters. Missile defense. Are you afraid of pirates? - Andrei makes countries face each other. It is your refuge. Do I have to accompany myself? - Volkov is not carrying passengers now. Then we take mine. ¡Max! Who is the American? A friend. - The man from Shipley's. While trying to get hit. I ask again. Who is he? We met in Riyadh at the US embassy. He is well defeated by a future diplomat. - Paranoia is your department, Andrei. Seems nice. I invited him to dinner. Max? - Look at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Did you send it alone? I promised to take it. I said you were busy. With your friend. Relax friend. Where I come from, you have to give dinner first. Mr. Sator. - Forget this. Tell me if you've already slept with my wife. No. Not yet. How would you like to die? Old age. - Then you are in the wrong industry. There is a garden nearby. There we take you and slaughter you. Not on the other side, but with a hole in the middle. Then we take his balls and squeeze them into the wound so that they block the windpipe. Complicated. It's satisfying to see someone you hate, - - try to get the balls out of his throat before choking. Do you treat all the guests like this? - We are done here. Do you like opera? Reach? - Not here. Are you browsing? - I have enjoyed both. Kajen kl. 8. Be prepared for more than comfort. - Kl. 8. Max has been absent from school too much. I take it to England. They will not accept any more absences. - Yes they will. I can talk? You behave like a king. You are a man in bad shape who plays power games with a wife who no longer loves you. You appear to be ... full of spirit today. Me? - Yes. Were you afraid it would be destroyed? I felt like I needed to get it out of the trunk. I have always been able to intuit the future. This is how I created the life that you no longer cherish. Sailing or diving? Ascension! What do you know about opera? In 2008, a Russian missile station was occupied for a week. When the station was recaptured, three-quarters of a kilogram of plutonium was missing. The missing plutonium ... appeared at the Kiev Opera on the 14th. Round! What do you suggest? A society. - I don't want that with you. You can take care of yourself. There are no papers on you. A trained arms dealer covering his tracks. It is not surprising. Being an intelligence agent. Starboard! Burn to hell, Andrei! This is not how you can steer a ship! - Yes, if necessary! Why didn't you let him drown? - I need it. Sell ​​weapons? - I'm not who you think I am. I know. He showed me the drawing. Sorry. I had to get into his life. What do you think your husband is doing? We both know he's an arms dealer. It's much more than that. - Than? Andrei Sator has everyone's life in his hollow hand. Not just yours. Mr. Sator will talk to you. - Good. Now. Will you see me without pants? Trust me. - I don't fall in love twice. Do you have a better option? You will do anything to achieve your goal. You are not thinking of me or my son. What do you think it will do to me now? Try not to use it. Against anyone. So that's enough. You can see? A resting pulse like that of a young man. Drink with me. I owe you my life now. Was nothing. - My life is nothing. And I don't like being in debt to anyone. So pay me by not getting revenge on your wife. Do you think he loosened the harness? It was my fault. - Then help me steal the plutonium. It is refined plutonium, so it must be handled and stored properly. I know all that well. Are you going to teach me about radiation? Andrei Sator, - who dug plutonium from the ruins of my city when I was a teenager. Where? Stalsk 12. My home. Part of a warhead exploded on the ground, scattering the others. They needed someone to find the plutonium. It was my first contract. No one else bid for him. They thought that one would die. But... the probability of a man dying ... It's another man's chance to create a life for himself. I took my place in the new Russia. To this day, my company is the only one operating in the ruins. Plutonium is transported through Northern Europe - - on the way to the permanent depot in Trieste. I heard you have resources in Tallinn. Stay here tonight. I insist on that. What are you going to? - We'll talk about today. No, we will not. - No? We will see. Don't think you can treat me like you treat other women. AND... How do you imagine ... Do I treat these other women? Do you think I'm forcing them to talk? You want to be quiet, so nice. You can bite it here. Even a soul as empty and fragile as yours needs an answer. Is fear and pain enough, Andrei? I can't offer you anything else. So I have to settle for that. - Why didn't you let me go? Why... if I can't catch you ... there is no one who can catch you. If you touch me, I scream for him to hear it. Do you think I let him in? - Then you had to kill him. Then the deal is over. So let me be, damn it. Not now! 98. Not bad after that effort. He was standing by the window. I was curious. My property shouldn't worry about you. Who are you? How did you get your information about the opera? You would never deal with someone who wasn't good enough to get recruited. The CIA represents 2/3 of the fissile material market. They tend to buy, not sell. But we live in a twilight world. - Is that Whitman? That sounds good. The next warning will be a bullet to the brain. There won't be time for that ... There won't be time for that ... en Tallinn. Go there. I want Volkov on your team. No I provide the material. You pay me. His wife is in charge of the transfer. Throw it on shore. Throw it on shore. How do I get in touch with you? - You do not. How do I get money up front? Take better care of plutonium. What did you find in the gold? - No marks, no plaster marks. Nothing. How? - Pick up locations. Bury a time capsule, send the coordinates ... - and digs it up again to recover the invested materials. It seems to happen instantly. Where do you bury it? A place that will not be discovered for centuries. What did the soil samples show? Northern Europe, Asia. Radioactivity. Everything that was saved from Oslo has been shipped here. What am I doing here? - I do not trust the judgment of others. The convoy through the city. What are we thinking Many people. Unpredictable traffic. It is almost impossible to plan an ambush. Good point. Is the convoy being controlled from the air? Tracking via GPS. One wrong turn and then the cavalry enters. We need weapons that send the message without firing. A fast car that doesn't seem fast. Four heavy vehicles. Everything different. A bus, a bus, a truck. One of them has to be a fire truck. And there should be no trace of our planning. Nothing electronic. Undocumented. Only your ignorance protects us. Can you see, Kat? These are some of my favorites. A little sweaty, but to save, right? I am not an expert on that. - Well, no. You would never have to deal with that kind of thing. But this is where our worlds collide. What is this, Andrei? - You know that very well, Kat. Dirty stores ... who paid for his clothes and his son's education, - - and with whom you thought you could negotiate. The convoy goes through the city in ten minutes. Off. - I'm not going anywhere with you. Look at me! And then understand ... that you never negotiate with a tiger. One admires a tiger until it turns to one, - - and you feel its true nature! Do not do. Stay there. Green, two minutes. You are not killing me. - I already tried it. You pushed me out of a boat, but you don't shoot me in cold blo I'm not cold-blooded, Andrei. No, but you are not angry enough. Because anger turns to despair over time. When I look into your eyes ... then I see despair. Vengeful sow! You're spying on me And think you're better than me! Then it is enough! Tell me everything as it happens. Close this page. Yellow, 60 seconds. - 60. Received. Blue, 45 seconds. - 45. Received. All right, red. We get closer to you. All three vehicles are in place. Watch everything. Give me all the details. They are all ready? Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Now yellow! We have a problem! - We need reinforcement! Shit! The radio does not work. - Are they still on the move? Look at the radio. I have seen encapsulation in all classes of weapons. This is not one of them. That is what you are looking for. I can not understand it. - You said you knew Estonian. He is not Estonian. It is backwards. What the hell is that? ¡Corre runs runs! Don't give it to him. It is not plutonium. - It's worse than that! Sorry. It gets away. He left her in the car! After her! Run Run Run! Up on the page. Come on. Closer to. Keep it stable. Hurry up! Come! Okay wait. I call in the cavalry. - What cavalry? If you don't tell the truth, he will die. I have no idea what you are talking about. - You left it in the car, right? Who told you that? - Tell me if he's in the BMW. I do not know. - Say it or I'll shoot him again. Let it be! - Kill him! I don't have time to negotiate. Listen to me. - Three. I can help you. - two. Not! - One. Next time he gets shot in the head. None. Two. Three. Okay! Okay. In the car. The BMW. - We'll check if it fits. It's in the glove compartment! Where you left it? In the car or the fire truck? Where? I need to know that before I go out. I already told you. - I believe in you. You wanted her here. I hope you're happy... Insured! - Wheeler, look at the other side. You two. Where did it disappear? - Actually. It's in the glove compartment! - We'll check if it fits. Three, two, one. - Good! Okay. Next time he gets shot in the head. Nerd! - One. Listen to me. - two. Three. I can help you. - I don't have time to negotiate. Say it or I'll shoot him again. Let it be! - Tell me if he's in the BMW. I do not know. You left it in the car, right? - Who told you that? If you don't tell the truth, he will die. - I have no idea what you're talking about. Medical attention! - State? Have you been shot? - Come here with her. Did you get shot with an inverted bullet? It's Ives. He is with us. "US"! Who are they? - Priya people. Our people. How did Sator find out about the ambush? - It's posterity. An ambush in the middle of the street leaves footprints. He knew everything we wanted to do! Someone said something. WHO? It was you? - Nerd. You have always known too much. Now I ask you again. Did you say something? No one has said anything. It is a maneuver that squeezes time. A what? - A pincer maneuver. Not in space. On time. Half of the team advances in time. Watch and finally attack while moving backwards. Then you know everything. - Except where I hid the plutonium. What is not plutonium, right? - I said that's what I wanted. And you told him where it is. I lied. Cross. Did you lie about it? He couldn't have checked on the spot. He had shot her anyway. It is standard procedure for lying. It has been spread too long. - Than? She dies. - Standard procedure. We can not do anything? Can we stabilize the radiation by inverting the patient? It takes several days. - Came. We took control of the machine a few minutes ago. How long can you live on this site? - Max. three hours. I am carrying it out. She is not going to die. I'm taking a risk. You can't go back again. We found another machine. - A week ago? Where? Oslo. - She's in a safe airport. It is impenetrable. - It wasn't last week. We are moving. You could also help us. This is a refund window. If you get close to the lock, - and if you don't see yourself in it, don't go in. Why not? - If you don't see yourself, you won't go out. Works? - Yes. See for yourself. There is your answer. Came. I clean and close the wound, but she needs time. How long do you need? Four - five days. Preferably one week. Neil, find us a way to Oslo. I'm going out again. What are you going to? Stop Sator from getting away with whatever I gave him. No. He lied about where he was. Wait. You want to save her. - I wanted to kill her in the past What if it does? - We can't know. If you change something there, you won't see the effect here. What you think? - What happened happened. We must save her here and now. If you go out again, you could give him what he's looking for. They must not carry her through again. Okay? We can't stay here. We don't have that much time. Find us a cozy shipping container, - - just arrived from Oslo. It's a cowboy thing. You have no idea what happens if you go out. I'm going out, do you have any advice? - Wheeler, send him a letter. You need to have air with you. The normal air does not pass through the lungs invested. The most important rule: never get in touch with the progressive version of yourself. That is the goal of protective suits. We don't have time for that. - Do your particles collide ... Than? - Extinction. That would be bad, right? When exiting the airlock, get your bearings. It will feel weird. When you run, you feel the wind on your back. If you find fire, ice will form on your clothing, because the heat exchange is reversed. Gravity will feel normal, but it will seem backwards to the world around you. You may experience disturbances in your vision and hearing. It is normal. Can I drive a car? - Cowboys. The address will feel different. Friction and wind resistance are reversed. You are inverted. It is not the world. Was the transponder in the box? - We have thrown the box. I'm moving backwards. That is the ball I have to follow. Give me the tracker. Okay. - Are you ready? Tracking... The material is not in the box. Bring the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter. He lied. It wasn't in the BMW. - Then where is it? I saw the delivery. You made me shoot him for no reason. But you got my heart rate above 130. No one has ever done it before. Not even my wife. You left a terrible mess for Ives and his team. The heat exchange was reversed. You're probably the first to suffer a cold stroke from a gasoline explosion. Nothing surprises me anymore. Are we on our way back to Oslo? In container Broken. He grabbed the material, Neil. I gave it to him on a silver platter. I warned you. - What is done is done. I'm ok now. But it is difficult to trust people who speak half truths. It's not fair. - You were involved before we met. Did you work for Priya? - No. Who recruited you, Neil? - It doesn't help to know now. When this is over, and if we're alive and you still want, - then you have to get the story of my life. Sorry, I confused you on this. - What's going on? Here, Neil obviously knows more about this than me. Good luck. If we say something to Kat, Priya sees her as a threat. Priya sees her now as a threat. You have the right to know why you might die. Should I die? - Not if it's up to us. And it does. - Who are you? Let's start with the simple things. All the laws of nature ... The material is not in the box. Bring the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter You are injured? What's the algorithm, Neil? Plutonium is a section of it. One in nine. It is a formula in physical form, so it cannot be copied or communicated. It is a black box with a function. Which? Investment. But not objects or people. The world around us. - I do not understand. As they reverse the entropy of more and more objects, - the two directions of time become more and more intertwined. But because our environment flows in our direction, - then we have taken over. They always swim against the current. It saved your life. The inverted blast crashed into the surroundings. He urinated against the wind. - The algorithm can change the wind direction. You can reverse the entropy of the world. What if it happens? Then game over. - Can you be more precise? Everyone and everything that has lived is instantly annihilated. Is that accurate enough? Including my son. The more you sleep, the faster you recover. In a bus. Now it doesn't last long. I've thought about it. We are their ancestors. If they destroy us, don't they destroy themselves? Then we come to the grandfather paradox. - Than? If you traveled back in time and killed your grandfather, ... - How could you have been born to commit murder? Which is the answer? - Nothing. It is a paradox. But in the future, those in power clearly believe that one can ... kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge out his eyes - - and cut her throat without consequences. Can they be right? - It does not mean anything. They believe in it. They are ready to annihilate us. Can I go back to sleep now? - No, listen here. Cold. - That time is invested ... Does that mean that we are here now, not that it never happens? That we stop them? Optimistically, you are right. - And pessimistic? With parallel worlds we cannot understand the relationship between ... consciousness and more realities. Does it hurt in the head? And. Try to get some sleep. Shit. They didn't take us inside Then what do we do? We use the hole in the building. The chaos, right after the plane hit him. Get prepared. Have you recovered enough? I do not know. I've never done this before. The firefighters are here. Before Kat enters, I arrange for Sator's men and secure the safe. Then you come with her. How is your arm? - Not so good. We move as soon as we hear the engines. Wait. Wait. You're bleeding. Let me look at that. Clear? Wait here. I'm moving out. Come! - ¡Corre runs runs! Now! You knew it was me. Why didn't you say something? It is complex when someone is pulling the bud themselves. But after? - I knew you would handle it. What is done is done. Who knows what would have happened if I had told you? The policy is to hide it. Whose policy is it? - Our friend. We are the ones who saved the world from what could have happened. Cat? I'm here. Something like a scar comes up, but you handle it. You did it. - You did what? Andrei has the algorithm. You don't know where it is. Or when. Take Priya here to Oslo. - Why? In two days he 'll tell me about plutonium. It does not support changes. - We will see. Now just bring her here. Hi Priya. - What's going on? Where's Neil? He worries about Katherine Barton, who almost died because of you. What have I done? - It's something you do. In two days you will get him to use plutonium as bait for arms dealers. I want to know why. - Did you let Sator get hold of the plutonium? No, I let him take over the algorithm. Tell me about it, Priya. It's unique. The scientist who created it took his own life, - so you wouldn't be forced to create a new one. One from the future? - About many generations. Why do you have to commit suicide? - Do you know the Manhattan project? Before the first test explosion, Oppenheimer was concerned that: If it would create a chain reaction that would engulf the entire world. They did it anyway and left. - He is the Oppenheimer of his generation. She creates a method to invert the world, - but convince yourself that by annihilating us they will annihilate the world. The grandfather paradox. But unlike Oppenheimer, she objects: - divides the algorithm into nine sections and hides them in the best possible place. In the past. Here. Now. There are nine nuclear powers. Not a bomber. Nine games of the best kept material in world history. The best possible hiding place. - Nuclear storage facilities. Sator's mission has been funded and guided by his future throughout his life. You must find and assemble the algorithm. - Why did they choose him? He was at the right time and place. - The collapse of the Soviet Union. The most uncertain moment in the history of nuclear weapons. How many sections does it have? - After plutonium all nine. Oh God. So you have to do it differently this time. To change things? So Katherine doesn't get hurt? So Sator doesn't take over the algorithm. If that universe can exist ... then it is not what we live in. Let's try. You warn me. - No I do not. Ignorance is our ammunition. - Frankly. If you had known what the algorithm is , would you have let Sator understand it? You want Sator to get the last section. This is the only way to reunite the other eight. He was supposed to steal it ... and lose it? The mission is complete. - You took advantage of me. How you took advantage of Katherine. This is the standard procedure. You have done your part. - My part? I am the protagonist of this operation. You ... are a protagonist. Did you think you were the only one who could save the world? No But Iam. Because I haven't said where and when to assemble the algorithm. You will soon. - No, I do not do that. Let's unite. - "U.S"? Why involve her again? - She can get close to him. Do you still trust her? - He thinks she's dead. But he did. - You see the world in a new way. Now is your turn. If it survives. If you don't think she knows too much. I can not. - Talk to the one who defends loose ends. I need you to promise me that she and her son will survive, Priya. What does a promise mean in our industry? They will be safe. There is a meeting place off the coast of Trondheim. Let's do it. Ives has a team ready to invest. - Do you have a padlock? The technology that we are trying to stop. It is treacherous to fight evil with evil. But there is someone in the future who will leave the algorithm continues its journey into the past. You understand ... Tenet was not founded in the past. Tenet will be founded in the future. He's so crazy about those birds. - How you feel? Say you want to kill him. - I can not. Why not? You must have killed a lot of people. Not with a dead man's button. - Your heart rate monitor. He is obsessed with his health. - It is connected to a system. Another bunch of emails set to reveal the pickup location: - if your heart stops. His death activates the algorithm. If he dies, the world will perish. Nobody dares to kill him. No, that's not the point. He wants to kill himself. Why? He is dying. Inoperable pancreatic cancer. And he takes the world with him to the grave. If he can't get it, no one can get it. He chooses where and when the world will sink. What time do you choose? You told him about a vacation where you made him feel loved. Vietnam. - You said he disappeared. What day? Yes, but I don't know what day it was. It was the 14th ten days ago. I was in Ukraine. The attack on the Kiev Opera. How do you know that? He wasn't on the yacht, so that's his window. To revisit the golden moment and let it be the last. Everyone is last minute. We have to snatch the algorithm without Sator finding out. If you think it's there, you're killing yourself. But not the rest of us. Where is the pickup location? - Shared knowledge, friend. Won't you say that? - Ignorance is our ammunition But you have to be on the yacht, Kat. - Why? You should prevent it from being killed until we know that the algorithm has been removed. If you take me there, my son sees it. It shouldn't be a painful time - if it will be the last. It is not necessary. So. We work our way back to 14, but not knowing where the place is, - - I can't make the big one. Do you know what a hypocenter is? Center for an underground nuclear test. Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation at Stalsk 12 on the 14th. The pickup location is at the bottom of the hypocenter. The explosion buries the algorithm. Then we better get him out of that hole before the bomb goes off. In gelled. Ahead. Next. In gelled. Where's Neil? It must have happened. - I did not say goodbye. This is a goodbye, right? - I wish you didn't do this, Kat. The worst thing Andrei made me was the offer he made me. That I had to go if I promised never to see my son again. I screamed and ... cursed. But he saw it on my face for a brief second. I considered it. I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done - or because he knows about me. An opportunity to save your son. You have no idea what that means to a mother. No. - You killed people you hated. It is not usually personal. - He's dying. It may not count. It always counts, Kat. You are not there to kill him. You are the backup. If we don't remove the algorithm and it kills himself, he will take us all to the grave. Just do your part, okay? Today is the 14. The coast of Siberia. Now we go. Continue one day back, then you can reach Vietnam. Who takes me aboard the yacht? - You get good help. When I'm done and you take care of your boy, do it here. You may feel threatened. Press "talk", say where you are, hang up. Who gets the message? - The beyond. Stalsk 12. Hidden from the rest of the world, here is a city where anything can happen. And today, in ten minutes, it will definitely happen. You are divided into two teams that have to make a maneuver to squeeze the time. We are the Red Team moving forward. Put them on here. Our friends there, Blue Team, led by Wheeler, are invested. Why don't they let us see them? - Maybe we don't like what happened. They got this report in an hour. Then they were put on the edge of the hypocenter - - as close to the detonation as possible. His goal was security and clarification. This report benefits from your experiences. Both teams have clocks that count down. Our countdown from ten from the landing ... to zero in the explosion. The blue team is reversed. If you are not in the zero landing zone, you will not escape from there. It is understood? We are clearing the landing zone for the blue The team can be evacuated. Then we move to the city. The buildings are abandoned, but we know there is a lock. Expect bitemporal resistance. - Do you have guns reversed? Expect bitemporal resistance. - Do you have guns reversed? On the other side of the city is the ridge over the hypocenter. A smaller group takes the tunnel from the city to the bottom of the hypocenter. Blue Team found an entry here. The bomb is here in the rock. High for the cave to collapse and seal itself. How do we disarm the bomb? - The explosion must occur. Our task is not to be able to disarm the bomb, - - while the smaller group achieves its goal without being seen. Which...? - You do not need to know. Other stupid questions? Well. Let us begin. Let's get ready. I wanted to be on the first wave. - There is no first wave. Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously. Don't get on the helicopter if your thinking is just linear. Do you want to be part of the team that steals the contents of the capsule? Absolutely. - We are. We are the smallest group. - Only U.S? No one who knows the contents of the capsule can leave the battlefield. I think we take care of ourselves. There are 12 meters from the private terrace to the water. Can you jump from there? In the head. Don't let him die until you see my sign. 30 seconds! Move! We explode in a shock wave. Wait! Get up! There! We thought you were on land. - I want to surprise Andrei. The boss is gone. Lad mr. Sator meet me here. And don't say anything to others. I'm fixing the mess. Miner! - Miner! They said you went ashore. - They said you were flying. I saw you and Max again. - Max is on the ground with Anna. We need time after what happened. - It was just a stupid joke. You think I'm a terrible mother. I have more thoughts about you than you about me. I want us to improve, Andrei. In coverage! Get me a fucking AT4! Shoot him! Now! Cover source! Off! Off! Come on! Go Go! Wheeler! Get away from there! - Come on! ¡Ives! The smallest group. Here. It will be a beautiful sunset. I can get Max. Let's share that moment with him.. I'm making you a drink. Take my son back to the boat. Time is running out. Come on! - If they see us, it was in vain. We must have derived them. - Do not think about it. At my signal! RPG, shoot the base! - That building on my sign! Three! Two! - One! Fire! Fire Move! Move! Now there is no turning back. Came. What is it? - I borrowed it from the CIA. What is it? - The way the world is sinking. Not with a bang, but with a groan. - I do not understand. When I take it here, it's all over. So don't take it yet. Why? Because we have to see the sunset. And there's some vodka left. And Max will be here soon. They said they thought it was you, not Anna, who went ashore with Max. As long as you can see the difference ... I just need to work a moment, beloved. Mahir, have you been received? I repeat: not out of danger! Received. - Repeat: Don't out of danger! ¡Neil! ¡Neil! Let's go! We don't have anything that can blow this up. Look at him. See if you have a grenade. Has something? - No, nothing. Try to see. Can you break it? I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock. Do you like the place where my journey began and where you end? It's too radioactive for my liking. - Radioactivity is my destiny. We work where no one else would. I negotiated with the devil. Money for time. We sold our future. And now you will make the same mistake on behalf of the whole world. It was not a mistake. That was the offer I received. What was your fault? You're fighting for a cause you barely understand - with people you trust so little that you haven't said anything to them. When I die, the world dies with me. And your knowledge dies with you in a grave, like if you were an anonymous egyptian worker, trapped in a pyramid to keep the secret. You are a fanatic. What is more fanatic than wanting to end the world? No, I want to create a new world. Somewhere once, a man in a glass tower presses a switch: - and Armageddon is activated and prevented. Time itself changes direction. The sun we enjoy will warm the faces of our descendants. How can they want to kill us? Because his garden grew and his rivers dried up. They have no choice but to turn around. We are to blame for that. Now that you know this, do you still want me to stop? Yes. Each generation provides its own survival. That is exactly what they are doing. - No, you're a traitor. You will kill everyone because your own life will soon end. Life goes on when I'm done. - Not her son. My biggest sin was putting a child in a doomed world. Do you think God will forgive me? Wait! Wait! Because then ...! ¡Cúbreme! We will! We will! You don't believe in God, the future, or anything beyond yourself. Everything else is belief. And I have no convictions. Without it, you are not human. Then you are crazy. Or a god. Of a kind. - As I've said before... Do not do. Cross. - Our time is up. I greet my wife with affection from you. You forget that I haven't met her yet. Oh yeah. After meeting her, she dies. Then I greet her warmly myself. Do not do... No... Volkov. Shoot him in the head. No more work now, beloved. You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? But it sounds tremendously important. Where are you going? - Are not you hot? What are you doing now? - I spilled some sunscreen. And that? - You can get into it. Now just come here. Turn around. You will enjoy it. I don't know this. Don't think you have won. Don't ruin the moment, Kat. - Don't think we're going to die with you. You must die alone, Andrei. Go Go! - The tunnel is destroyed. The door is closed. Mahir, can you hear me? - Yes. Wait. Repeat: wait. Look me in the eyes. What can you see? Despair or anger? I'm not her who could love you despite the mental scars you gave her. I'm the vindictive bitch that left scars on your body Ne! Shit. Ives, she killed him. Is it received, Ives? She couldn't wait. She killed him. Come on! Do you think they made it? Up the ass with that. Kat, it was too early! I couldn't let him die believing that he had won. I knew you would find a way out. No, you didn't? We are good, right? Yes, I found a way out. We are out of danger. I thought you were backwards. - I changed gears halfway. You probably needed help here. - We needed help down there. How did you break the lock? Was not me. Didn't your team need you? I'll pick them up next time. Are you okay, Ives? - Yes, when I catch my breath. No one who has seen it comes from here. Okay. We are hiding it. We take our lives. That is the only way we can be sure. When will it happen ... we may have to decide for ourselves each. Don't you want to kill us? - If I find you, I will. But don't you want to lead so thoroughly? Yes, I will do it. Aren't you going to London to see Kat? - No. It's too dangerous. Not even at a distance? Not even at a distance.. Ives! Wait. Do you really want to go back in? I'm the only one who could open the door in time. Nobody is better than you to open doors. You can see? It's me, again. I weave a new past on the mission. Neil, wait! We just saved the world. We cannot leave anything to chance. But can we change something if we do something different? What is done is done. It is an expression of trust in the mechanisms of nature. It is not an excuse for not doing something. Destiny? - Call it whatever you want. What do you call it? - Reality. Let me go. You never told me who recruited you. Haven't you guessed now? You did it. But not when I thought. You have a future in the past. Many years ago for me. In many years for you. Have you known me for years? For me, this is the end of a beautiful friendship. But for me, it's the beginning. - We make amber in it. You will love it. You will see. This whole operation is a maneuver that squeezes time Whose? Yours! You are only halfway there. See you at the beginning, friend. We are the ones who saved the world from what could have happened. The world will never know what could have happened. And if they did, they wouldn't care. Because nobody cares about a bomb that doesn't explode. Just the one that jumped. Do it before the boy comes out. Is that your kind of grace? You gave me your word. And I told you what it would be worth. Here. Today. How did you know? Cannon Place at three o'clock. It's probably nothing, but ... The beyond. Cannon Place at three o'clock. It's probably nothing, but ... I said you had to start seeing the world differently. I have to remove the loose ends. - It was never your job. Whose task was it then? - Mine. I realized that I wasn't working for you. We both work for me. I am the protagonist. Then you better remove the loose ends. The mission is complete. It is the bomb that did not explode. The danger, nobody knew, was present. It is the bomb that can change the world.
