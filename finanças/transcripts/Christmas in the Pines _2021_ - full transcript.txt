It's official... This is the least Christimasy Christmas ever. Mom: Oh Ariel- Oh my goodness, there it is! I need this purse more than anything in the world. Ariel: I've never even seen you with a purse. Because I've been waiting for this one. Well, I hope you're crossing something else off of that very long list of yours. No, I need everything on it. You don't need everything on it. Plus, didn't you just get a huge promotion? Jasmine! Ariel's promotion is not a direct correlation for a Christmas gift. Why not? It's not like she has anyone to spend it on. It's not like she has a boyfriend. Hey, she will find Mr. Right. Sure about that? Someday. Mm-hmm. I don't know if the right guy exists for Ariel. Yes, he does. He exists. He does. So... [SIGH] what are we looking for? Someone smart... Good. And affectionate... Mom: Good. Someone loyal... Mom: Exactly. Someone who makes lists of people that we're gonna visit, not thingsthat he wants. Okay well that guy doesn't exist yet so... my last exam is tomorrow at the ungodly hour of 8 am so I will meet you here at 11. Wait, why? You have 5 days to get your Christmas shopping done! I don't want to spend the holidays shopping. Okay truce, truce... Seriously each year I just wish that we'd make Christmas about spending it with the ones we love. - Hello! You know, sitting by the fire, baking cookies. I wish we could just make ornaments and sing songs. Well, we already have ornaments, and you can't even sing. Seriously, I don't want Christmas to be about shopping lists. Girls, listen to me. Christmas is what we make it. Mm-hmm. [GASPS] I am so sorry I didn't see you. Are you okay? Oh yes, I'm fine. I couldn't help but overhear your wish. My wish? Santa: Uh-huh. Oh right, Santa. Well maybe you should speak to my sister about her Christmas list. Santa: Oh no, I don't do that sort of thing anymore. All the stores and online shopping has really put us out of business. Now I specialize in things that you can't get from a store. [CHUCKLES] I'll do my best to give you the kind of Christmas you wish for. But Ariel, your mother's right. Some of the responsibility lies with you. Christmas iswhat you make it. Well I'm afraid I must go, I'm late. Good day. Bye Santa! Bye! Ho, ho, ho! Santa... how'd you know my name? That's it! I have an idea! I'll do it! You just give me your credit card, and I will shop for everyone... including myself... and I'll even wrap everything. Oh. What? It's a great idea! That is not a great idea. Okay, just listen and hear me out. What if your sister's right? And what if we don't have presents this Christmas? Mom, seriously? Yeah! And maybe... would that be so bad? Easy for you two to say. You both have jobs and money. I am a college student and therefore broke. Christmas and birthdays are when I stock up on things. Okay, well what about the people in need? What about the people who have less than us? Ihave less. Ineed things. [MONEY CLANKS IN BUCKET] [ARIEL'S CELL PHONE RINGS] Oh, here... Hold on... Erica? Who's Erica? I don't know.

This year, like every other year, I had made the perfect itinerary because long ago I realized that I can't leave Christmas to chance. When I was little we used to spend Christmas with my grandparents. We played games, made ornaments and baked cookies. Those were the true old-fashioned Christmases that I tried to recreate ever since. But nowadays nobody knows the true meaning of Christmas. Or so I thought. I prided myself on knowing that Christmas wasn't about presents. What I didn't realize is, I forgot to cherish what was right in front of me. Through the strangest of circumstances, which I must tell you about in another issue, my family and I got a chance to spend this Christmas in beautiful Carolinas with another family. A family who wasn't looking forward to this holiday. Because it was their first Christmas without someone. A mom, who made every holiday special. She left behind a family: a son, who didn't know how to spend Christmas without her. And yet, while I was complaining about not having a perfect Christmas...Hey! Oh! Oh...she's so pretty.
