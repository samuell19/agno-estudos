(dark atmospheric music) (flame hisses) (sizzling) - Oh, my god. (suspenseful music) Dr. Darden. Dr. Darden, the experiment's going through another change. - Alright, we'll be right there. Don't touch anything. This whole god-damn thing is goin' down the tubes. (suspenseful music) (sizzling) - What? What's going on? - Don't worry. I accounted for this. (scientist groans) - But you didn't account for this. (ominous music) (tense orchestral music) - Commander Krieger. We're getting a distress call. - Put 'em through. - It's coming from the research facility on the planet Phaebon. - [Scientist] We've had an accident, it's out of control. We need help. We've had an accident. Anyone, respond! Please respond. - Get 'em back. - The transmission has cut out. Recommend you terminate R and R immediately. (dark atmospheric music) Commander, there are three unidentified vessels approaching our ship. Your presence on the bridge would be appreciated. (lasers fire) (rumbling) - Throw up the deflectors, I'll be up right away. (suspenseful music) (lasers fire) (rumbling) Damage? - Nice of you to join us. They've penetrated our sector three defense shields. - Divert power to the lasers. - That wouldn't be my first choice, Commander. - Well, do me a favor, try it. Go evasive, re-target the lasers, use a random pattern. Now what? - It's not my fault. - Well, whose fault is it? It's gotta be the main connection under the panel. I told you to get it fixed this morning. - Some of us have other responsibilities, Commander. (lasers fire) - I'm gonna have to hold this together manually now. Fire when I give you the command. Unless you've got a better idea? - Nope. (wires spark) - God. (wires spark) Alright. Fire! (wires spark) (lasers fire) - Good shot! (Krieger coughs) - Fire! (wires spark) (lasers fire) - Two down. (lasers fire) - Fire! (wires spark) (lasers fire) - Not bad, for a human. (sparks pop and crackle) Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire-- - Well, I don't wanna extract from some very important business, but we got a problem. - [Pilot] Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire-- - Tinpan? - Fire, fire, fire, fire. Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire-- (extinguisher hisses) Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire. Thanks. - How's the ship? - Defense shields are out, lasers are out. Generators at 30%. - Where'd you say that distress call was coming from? - From a research lab on the planet Phaebon. It's not far from here. - Well, we'll have to risk it, set course for Phaebon. How much trouble could a couple of scientists get into anyway? (suspenseful music) You call that a landing? (suspenseful music) I'm Commander Steve Krieger. Freelance controller responding to your distress signal. This is my second in command, Tinpan. What seems to be the problem? - Welcome to the Phaebon Research Laboratory. I am Dr. Emily Stote, head of research. This is Dr. Salinger. - Marissa Salinger, genetics. - [Emily] The call was a little premature Commander Krieger. If our radio hadn't gone out-- - But we're happy you're here. - Wait a minute, are you telling me this is a false alarm? - There is no immediate danger. If you'll follow us, Commander, we'll show you to your quarters. - Nice goin', false alarm. (playful music) Well, it's very nice. I don't believe it, are you happy, are you satisfied? You brought all this distance and they don't even need us. - There does seem to be some dispute in that area. - [Steve] Oh? - Dr. Salinger thinks it's very important we stay. - Well, I'll tell you what I think's important. We get back to the ship, we make it operable, and we're in the star charts, we're outta here, we're history. Let's see if we can't get this bucket up and running again. I'm getting a bad feeling about this place. - We have a problem, Commander. - Nothing you can't fix, I hope. (explosion booms) Well, that answers that. - Oh, there you are. - Oh, hi, doc. - We're ready in the conference room. - We need to talk. - Let's talk on the way. It was hard enough getting Emily to have this meeting. - Commander Krieger, this is a high-security research facility. We're stationed on Phaebon because we can experiment and take risks here that would be unthinkable on Earth. - What kind of experiments? - Genetic engineering, bacteriology mostly, but not in this case. - What's this case? - Excuse me, should've been lookin' where I was goin'. - It's alright, aren't you headed the wrong way? - Just gotta go to my room and get some stuff. - Tim. Don't leave. Commander Krieger, please, come in. Everyone, I would like to introduce Commander Steve Krieger, and his executive officer, Tinpan. Steve, Tinpan. This is our chief bacteriologist, Frank Darden. Jill Tollman, computer electronics specialist. Sal Dickens, engineer. And Devon Latham. The sole survivor of the astrolab six incident. As we all know, our objective here on Phaebon is to find a cure for the Delta-Five virus. - Oh, shit. - I'm very sorry to hear you feel that way Commander Krieger but you can rest assured it wasn't my idea to bring you here. - Whose was it, then? I get the distinct impression you're in charge. - I sent the call. And I don't think it was premature. - That remains to be seen. - We had an emergency on our hands, and still do. - It was not an emergency, it was a problem, and that problem has been solved. - One of our research assistants has contracted a very rare disease, possibly transmitted through one of the viruses that we have been experimenting with. - What? - Why didn't you tell us this before? - Marissa and I have discovered that the only way to combat an aggressive virus like Delta-Five, is to create an even more aggressive virus. One that will single out and destroy Delta-Five, which renders our immune system so helpless, and yet, coexists with our benign cells in a symbiotic relationship. - Yeah. - But we ended up creating a monster. - It is not a monster! - I can't believe this. - Joe was in the lab, checking the conditions in the incubator. Just before we discovered him taken with the disease, he told us the liquid in the Petri dish was bubbling. - And shortly after, it did begin to change. - It changed? - Yes. It appears to be a metamorphic mutant. - A what? - An ordinary mutant is genetically different from its parent. A metamorphic mutant changes its genetic structure, mutating as it grows. - We needed a virus that could adapt as Delta-Five threw up its defenses. And this new virus is our most promising project yet. - Does it work? - Do you mean can the mutant virus kill the Delta-Five virus? Unfortunately, no. But it can be harmed by it. Jill, why don't you put up the file, please? - It'll be on the room monitor. - This is the Delta-Five virus. That's our virus moving in on Delta-Five. Notice the speed on infection. We've created the only organism that we know of that Delta-Five can't infect, as a matter of fact, the only way Delta-Five can harm our virus, is if it found a way to get inside it and vice-versa. (suspenseful music) - I think it's time I took a look at your monster. - Meet our monster. - Well, this is not a Petri dish of liquid, bubbling or otherwise. - It began cocooning a few days ago. - You could bombard it with lasers or x-rays, or whatever you've got, and kill it. - That's exactly what we don't want! - Frank, you're blind, this virus is dangerous! - And this is not a debate. We don't have sufficient reason to terminate the experiment. For all we know, it could be the very breakthrough we're looking for. - If you don't wanna kill it... What am I doing here? - [Emily] You are here because Marissa acted rashly and sent out a distress call. I have explained all this out of courtesy, Commander Krieger but quite frankly, you and Tinpan are free to go. - Well, we can't go, my ship's been damaged. I used up the last of my power getting here. (glass smashes) (suspenseful music) - Look! - There! - Watch out! (gun fires) - No, no, no! - Stop it, everyone, stop it! Where is it? Frank. Frank, what's happening? (Devon screams) God damnit, Devon, Devon! Oh! God. Devon. - I'll prep for surgery, we've got to contain it. - Contain it, this experiment has gone far enough. - [Frank] Come on. (ominous music) - What's going on with Devon? What is hap, Marissa, what is happening here? Why isn't anybody telling us anything? We had a right to know. I can't believe Dr. Stote kept this from us. - Wasn't just Stote, the old man knew, too. - How's she doin'? - [Frank] Well, she's stable. Heart and oxygen level. Of course, the brain is gone. We knew that before we started. Her cerebrum has been eaten away. There's also partial collateral sulcus. Fourth ventricle collapse. But, there is life in the cerebellum. Heart is still pumping, body tissue seems viable. - [Emily] I don't know why we are wasting our time. I thought we were being so careful. - [Frank] We still might be able to capture this thing and study it, find out where we went wrong. Millions of lives are depending on this research. We have got to keep it alive. - This is not personal, Frank. It killed Devon, it probably killed Joe. We've gotta find this god-damn thing, terminate it, before it kills any more. We've got muscle spasms. - Frank! (creature shrieks) (gun fires) (creature shrieks) (gun fires) (glass smashes) (suspenseful music) - That's what you call a muscle spasm? - [Frank] That's what I call science. - Damn! Hey, your computerized vent control system won't work. Now, I need those vents closed so I can flood this thing with gas and poison it! - Jill, get the damn computers going, and see if that's possible. - Alright, alright. - This thing is tough and adaptable, and it's growing at an incredible rate. - But if it can't find another host, it won't keep evolving. - Is it possible we're thinking about this the wrong way? Maybe it attacks because it feels threatened. Maybe we give it some food or whatever attracts it, help it escape into the atmosphere? - How does this thing operate? (Frank coughs) - It's like any other virus. A simple organism composed of a protein coat. - Cut the shit. - It's capable of growth only in other living cells. - He means us. He wants to kill us. - Want is not quite right, it exists to kill. - I'd say it's high time we adopted the same creed. Can we at least locate this thing in the air vents? - Maybe, we have a system for detecting debris in the vents when they get backed up, but it's not the best. - [Emily] Get it on the computer. - That system's in the control room. Look, I don't mind going, but I'd really rather someone watch my back while I worked. - We've gotta get those vents sealed, so the thing can't get out. - Well, the only way to do that is to get those vents closed manually, one by one. - Great, at least this place is only built on one level. Tinpan and I'll start at the back and work our way forward. - I called you here, I'll start on this end. - No, I'll go. Look, I know exactly where those vent locks are. - I'm going, too, I can handle myself. I was in Rev Corps. - Alright. - Give him the gun. (suspenseful music) - Let's go, here's another point. - 20 closed! - Alright, 19 closed. Get 18. - 18 closed! - 17, get 16. 17 closed. - 16 closed! - Alright, 15, make sure you get the main vent. Alright, let's go! - Main vent closed! - Any progress? - This thing's so slow. (suspenseful music) - [Sal] Closed! Watch it. - Give me the gun. - Rev Corps, huh? - What's on your mind, Commander? - That girl. She was a survivor of the astrolab six incident. - What does the astrolab six accident have to do with this situation? - That was no accident. They nuked that lab. And everybody in it. - What happened? - It was termed "an unavoidable biological incident." All that means is they had an experiment that got loose on 'em. Just like this. - Where are Marissa and Sal right now? - They're in a hallway near Tim's room. - Krieger and Tinpan are in the genetics lab. - Alright, Frank, what's on your mind? - What's on my mind? Emily, if you continue to let this space cowboy take over control of this project, he'll kill it. He hasn't got the sensitivity to understand what we're trying to accomplish. - I have no intentions of giving up control to anyone, but I also have to consider the safety of everyone here. - What about the safety of the people with Delta-Five? What about their lives? - Punch in C3937. - Commander, have you asked yourself why Dr. Darden doesn't terminate this experiment? (ominous music) (Jill sighs) - Can I help? - Yeah, right. Last time you helped, we lost three programs. - Alright, both of you, keep it civil. Back to work, Jill. (muffled clattering) - This is my room. (suspenseful music) (glass smashes) (screams) (Marissa screams) - Come on. (creature shrieks) (Sal screams) (gun fires) (creature shrieks) - Sal! Are you okay? Sal, are you okay? (Sal pants) (ominous music) Oh, god. - Well? - His blood's not circulating properly. The soft tissue is deteriorating. - Gangrene? - Yes. We can't stop it. - He'll be dead soon. Like the others. - So? What now? - This thing... Is sealed up in the vents, for now. So, may I suggest that we all take advantage of that fact, by pairing up and taking turns getting some rest. - I don't think that this is a-- - Marissa. We all need some rest. Krieger, obviously you and Tinpan should stay together. Frank, you and I will go back to the lab, and we will conduct some-- - Doc. Why don't you get some rest, too? We'll convene back here at 0700, okay? (moody music) - These are my quarters. - You gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Krieger? You know, you were very good in there with Stote just now. - Does that surprise you? Tinpan. - Bring him in here. (peaceful music) - Well, why don't you try to get some sleep? I'm not very tired anyway. - Forget it, I couldn't even sleep now if I tried. Look, why don't you just sleep and I'll read or something. - I've got a better idea. - This doesn't sound like-- - Just give it a try. I wanna do this for you. Try to relax. - Never heard that one before. - Jill. - Okay. Okay. - Now we're done. You better take up your position. - Here are the schematics for most of the station. - Thanks. This could give us an edge. Emphasis on could. We could use a strategic advantage. - What do you mean? - It's big and it's bad-tempered. That's all we know about it so far. It's got us cornered. Are you okay? - I'm sorry. (melancholic music) It's just that... Sal was my friend. - I know. It's hard to lose a friend. - It's... It's such a waste. And what for? (peaceful music) (door slides closed) (Frank coughs) - You're getting worse. - You've known? - You have the classic symptoms, doctor. Nervousness, quickened heart rate. - I found out I had it shortly before I volunteered for this assignment. - And why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to keep working. Emily. If you had known, you would have discharged me, and it was my only chance. This may be our only change. - I wouldn't have done that, Frank. Who knows? Maybe we still have a chance. (suspenseful music) (Marissa screams) - Marissa. Marissa. You alright? - Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. - That's okay. It was just a dream. - Yeah. A dream. (screams) (creature shrieks) (gun fires) (creature shrieks) - I'm gonna go find it, Tinpan, alert everybody. You better take this. Go with him. (suspenseful music) - Get up, let's go, the creature's out! Get to the med lab! - Come on! - Let's go, come on! Let's go! - Where are you going? - I'm going after Steve. - Sal. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - What're you doing here? - I thought you might need some help. - Why aren't you with the others? - They got me into this, I don't trust them to get me out. - Stay close. (suspenseful music) (clattering) (rumbling) (squelching) (gun fires) (creatures snarls and shrieks) (gun fires) (gun fires) (creature snarls and shrieks) (gun fires) (gun fires) (creature snarls and shrieks) - [Emily] Marissa? - No, wait, wait, wait. We've got to check their condition. - What happened? Are you alright? - The thing escaped. Through the glass. The room's sealed now. - It's huge, it's growing, it's bigger than I am. - You know, it's out of the lab now. I mean, maybe we're okay. What are the chances it'll survive? (muffled clunks) - Well, there's your answer. This thing you've created, it's gonna destroy your lab, either from the inside out or the inside in. Tinpan? Let's go make an executive decision of our own. - He's a fool if he thinks he can stop it. - Here, let me fix this. I don't know why I bother. You old T2 models are always falling apart. - Tim, can you give me a hand over here? - [Tim] Sure. - I need the code for the external monitors. - Will we be able to follow him? - Every move. - I'll let Krieger know. The external monitors are still working, so we'll be able to watch your back the whole time you're out there. You're in luck. - That's not luck. Luck would be if this thing disappeared off the face of the planet, that'd be luck. How long can I exist out there in this thing? - You've got 20 minutes without any problem, after that, the suit will deteriorate. - Narcosis? - Similar to it. And just as dramatic, at first it's a high, and then it will kill you. - Sounds like fun, let's go. - Good luck. (suspenseful music) Oh, god, Frank. - [Frank] Let's get to work. (suspenseful music) (strong wind blows) - He's gotta be out here someplace. - There's a lot of territory to cover. - Alright. Let's go look for him. (keyboard clacks) - There they are. (Tim chuckles) - Stupid robot. It's just gonna slow him down. (strong wind blows) - This way. - Here it comes. Oh, god damnit. This confirms it. - Confirms what? - It's incredibly simple. (chuckles) (coughs) (strong wind blows) - [Tinpan] There he is. (gun fires) (creature shrieks) - Let's go. - Look at that, we know that guns don't work on it. - Well, what else is he gonna do? (strong wind blows) (distant snarls) (distant shriek) (gun fires) - Why is he goin' up there? - I think he knows what he's doing, Tim. (suspenseful music) - Such an obvious error. Whereas Delta-Five only makes us susceptible to disease... This virus actually is the disease. God help us. (Steve screams) - He fell, he fell off the rocks! - Did you get a shot at him? - No, it moved too fast. - Help me up, alright? (groans) - He's going into a cave. - Well, I don't think he's gonna find it in there. - Tim, I don't understand this. Why are you being such a jerk? - What's your problem? I mean, it's obvious this guy is an idiot. - My problem is I can't believe I just slept with such a worm. I mean, is this all you can do, stand around and criticize the guy who's trying to save our lives? - I gotta get some rest. - I think it's best to stay until the storm passes over. - Oh, yeah, I think I broke something when I fell. - Krieger. Krieger! - Can you get him back? Jill! - I can't, I lost him when he went in the cave. - Try him on another frequency. - It's not working. - Damn. (creature roars) (guns fires) (guns fire) - Get up, go! (gun fires) - There it is, they need help. - No, Jill, you stay here, we need you here. Tim, you go. - There's no time. (suspenseful music) (creature roars) - Commander! Commander! (guns fire) Come on! (guns fire) Let's go! (gun fires) - Tinpan! - Come on! - No, that's my friend! - He's a robot, come on! (creature snarls) - God. (gun fires) (creature snarls) (somber music) (gun fires) - Get back! (Jill screams) (Steve coughs) - Where's Jill? - She's dead. It dragged her down the main air shaft. - God. Oh, god. Tim. Tim, locate the main shaft in the files, and tell us where it comes out. Pull it up on the computer, Tim. Now track it. The main air shaft. - It's... It leads to the control room. (saw buzzes) - [Frank] Okay, let's take a sample of the pancreas. - It's back, it's in the control room! (alarm whines) (gun fires) - Oh, god. - We're gonna have to do better than that, if we're gonna stop this thing. - Careful with that. - Be careful? Why don't you tell that to Sal and the others? - Marissa, as head of research, I have done what I-- - To hell with research! I'm talking about survival. (suspenseful music) - [Tim] (yelps) It's Jill! - [Frank] Tim, don't touch her, get back! Get away, don't touch her! - Let's help! - Don't, don't touch her! Help me get Sal off this table, come on! Get back! - Get her on the table, help her on the table. - God damnit, Tim, get away, she's diseased! - What do you mean she's diseased? She's hurt! - No, we made a mistake. The virus, it carries disease. Every disease we've ever known. (Jill moans) - Kill me. Please. - I can't. (gun fires) - I'm gonna go look for it. - Krieger? Krieger? - Where did he go? - I don't know. - Oh. - Tim! Tim! (muffled snarls) (suspenseful music) Tim! Tim? Don't, don't. Don't, Tim. Come on. Tim. Tim! Tim? Tim. - It's okay. (creature snarls) - (screams) Tim, Tim! Tim! Tim, get the gun! - What? - Get the gun! - Okay. - Tim, shoot it, shoot it! - Oh, god. (gun fires) (creature snarls) - What are you doing, Tim? Shoot it! What are you doing? Tim! (creature snarls) (Tim screams) No! (creature snarls) - Emily. Emily, I've got an idea. You've got to help me. - What is it, Frank? - Delta-Five and this virus are hostile to each other. Yet, neither can penetrate the other's defenses, now, I am afflicted with Delta-Five. If we can get this creature to ingest some of my tissue... Darts. We'll fill up the dart guns with my blood instead of a tranquilizer and then we'll shoot this bastard and just see what happens. - Frank, you're too weak. - No. - And you can't stand to lose any blood. - Emily, I am not weak. I'm dead. (groans lightly) - Are you okay? - [Frank] Please. Give me this much. - Tim. No, no, don't touch him. - Look out! (creature roars) (dramatic music) (creature snarls) - [Marissa] Look out! (yelps) (gun fires) - Get out. Get out, get out! Go! (grunts) (thuds) (creature roars) - Krieger! - Go! - No! - Go! - Krieger! (thuds) (grunts) (creature snarls) (gun fires) (creature roars) (gun fires) (creature roars) - Krieger! Krieger, Frank has the disease that'll kill this thing. His blood, you've got to shoot it with these! (gun fires) (yelp) Frank! (creature shrieks) (screams) (creature roars) (glass smashes) (alarm whines) (suspenseful music) (creature snarls) (somber music) (tense music) (creatures shriek) (Marissa sobs) (suspenseful music) - Krieger? (squelching) (distant squelching) Steve? (squelching) Steve? (squelching) (squelching) (rattling) (squelching) (creature shrieks) (screams) Steve! (creatures shriek) (gun fires) (creature shrieks) (creature shrieks) (wails and grunts) No more, no more, no more! No, no, no! No! (sobs) - Well, I guarantee you, I'm gonna think twice before I ever answer another distress signal. - Consider yourself lucky, Commander. You came out in one piece. (peaceful music) - How are you doin'? - Good. - Another 14 days and I'll have you back to base operations. - I don't wanna go to base operations. Let's go home. - This is my home. (peaceful music) (dramatic music)
