Hello, Doctor. - Good Day. Say, am I crazy? I thought they'll arrive tomorrow? Yes, that's correct. That's the problem. The transport was planned for tomorrow. I haven't prepared anything yet. I hope they are vaccinated. - Not at all. They have been channeled through in Hamburg Everyone got a kipper and away they went No! Barack 6, I said! They are all deaf. Barack 6, I say! One moment, Doctor, i'm coming. Nowak! I'll talk with him about you. We have to order some more lymph. I also need some needles. All done, Doctor. Doctor, what's the problem? They'll start a riot here! They know when the office hours are. - I ordered them here. Not you. Go home. You should come back next week. The pain will be there allright. How's your eye? Let's have a look. A drink? - No thanks, Doctor. But i'll have my cigar. - Yes. I believe you have too much stress. No, not because of that. - I forbid that. You should make this a habbit too. - Yes. Let's examine your eye. - Yes, you'll see it. How can this be done allone? doctor here, hospital there. Also, a cold, and what else one got. No, that's too much. - beautiful. beautiful is the eye. How about an assistant? I have one for you. Keep warm. Tomorrow, Placzek. Yes? Adieu. - Thanks, Doctor. How was it? Look, how often do I have to tell you to leave me alone? I'm happy when i'm alone. And when I need someone, who goes on my nerves, I have you. - what you like. You can tell it to me, if you change your mind. This many came with the others today and he'll stay for a while. He's a chemist from Kattowitz. Nowak is his name. He was an assistant once. Do you mind if we vaccinate him in the cafeteria? It's too cramped in here, or? You can examine him in here. Leaves a good impression. - Yes, yes. I'll be there in an hour. I have a few visits to make. - Ok. All right, Nowak. With such an white coat you almost look like an doctor. If the boss is in a good mood, he'll let you operate as well. We have to finish with the inoculations. The cafeteria has to be ready. The folks haven't eaten yet. Stop smoking in here! You know that it's not allowed. Hard to belive. He can't be without an cigarette not for an moment. You too! That's Dr. Neumeister. Next, please. Hurry up! The faster you can leave again. Doctor? Here's Nowak. You did want to think it over, or? Well, he can join. - There you are. Very well. You know the facts, Nowak, or? Please come in my office later. Ask her, in which month she is. - in the seventh. Then I can't vaccinate her. Lucky you. Next, please. Keep your nerves, Doctor. Nowak, that's me. Yes,it could not be avoided. Can I take your place? Please help yourself. - Excuse me, Doctor. I did knock on the door, but it seems your haven't heard it. You are right. All the things we could speak about, aren't very comfortable. why should we mention them then? Please interpret your silence as substantial arrangement,. Yes, a mutual and substantial arrangement. Who was that? Are your frightened? It's goat milk. A nice girl, just a bit crazy. She brings me goat milk every evening. Strange, you are frightened. Oh, that's a pre cautious habit of mine. The past years did leave their marks. Me too. - Do you have a cigarette? In former times I could have helped you. Well, that's over. - I'll get you one. Do you remember Winkler? He did shoot him in his head when they were after him. No really? Winkler? Yes, he did change his name too. Well, you have a civilized life here. Well yes. - compared to the circumstances. My circumstances are less civilized. But resettlement transports are practical . Do you understand? Who's got papers? Poor Winkler is dead? Strange, now it's only us. You and I. You didn't want to believe that we are in the same boat. Now you won't doubt that again. I mean, I don't think that one of us can leave. We both did change our name, Dr. Neumeister. And you are frightened. You know, i almost like you. Don't make more than there is out of our random encounter . - random? random... - Yes, yes. What's going on? Nothing. Just the bottle is empty. How about going in the cafeteria and continuue our little chat there? One moment, please...you always were a strange saint and now What's strange about that? Or do you prefer an empty bottle? All right, I won't resist. We have to celebrate our encounter. Especially because it's random. It's random, or? It's not as lxurious as our institute. There you are again boss! I have to welcome someone. An old friend of mine. Nice chap, very relaiable. Good evening. - Good evening, Doctor. Placzek, didn't I tell you to keep the eye warm? That's a scandal. That's to keep it warm. Did you had lunch already? - Not really. Thank you. I won't resist. A beer? - Yes, a beer please. And a bottle cognac. That's why we came here, hm? Yes. - You did forgot your cigarettes. Really? Oh, thank you. - I did forget matches. You don't have to be frightened here. You are save here. Absolutely save. Just relax. The doors are closed, windows are closed. Everything's quiet now. Nothing will come in. The fear will stay outside. We are finished. We are there. Or, Liske? - Nobody will come. You are the last ones. Yes. We are the last ones. Now we are here. I do like you much more, since I know that you know the feeling. Since I know that you are frightend. - Ah, ok! Correct. but... I don't understand. Fear... what for? You only know the feeling of uneasiness, that provokes the fear. You don't know what an almighty feeling fear is. I tell you: Fear kills every other feeling. Every other. Yes. It kills. Some kill for the fear of others. What does remain? Let's drink to our random encounter! Liske, do you want to cheer too? by chance? Oh, he's sleeping. Well yes. Prost, Hoesch! Ich meine, Nowak. How was that? A mutual and substantial arrangement. You really are hungry. - Tastes very good. There, there. He's hungry, he's frightened. Almost human. - Don't talk so much, Doctor! You're turning like a roundabout. Condemned man's breakfast. Either you're crazy or drunk. It would be good if you'd say it straight. Do you remember this? Is that mine? - Yes. Is it always with you? - Yes! That's good. You still have the gun. Strange, hm? - Cheers, Doctor! Pst! - what's going on? He's awake. See? Nothing that's alive does sleep so deep that it couldn't awake. If it's alive! Strange, hm? - Yes, strange. Doctor, I'll leave now. I have to get up very early tomorrow. Good night, Doctor. - Good night. Turn out the lights, yes? - yes. I'll leave the key. I'll pick it up tomorrow. Don't forget it, please. - No. I don't forget anything. - what's the matter? What do I want from you? I'm on the run. Without papers. I did help you once too. He did help me, he says. You do blame me for this, hm? Well, I have to pay my depts then. Depts have to be paid. Must be a heavy dept. Very heavy. You did help me in the past and I have to help you today, it's simple. You're on the run, you said. Yes... I have to take care that you now find piece on your escape. I have to start to pay my dept. You can't shoot. - Now i'm to blame as well. Must be heavy. You know, it bears me down. Just think about it: Since December, the 8th 1943. With tax... It's heavy. wait... the strange thin is.. I had it very good in the past, when you imposed your help on me. Yes, the railroad was always overcrowded. The main thin was that I had a job. That was all I needed. You did have a good life, Doctor. Simply your appearance! Very striking for the times. I had a lot property, but else... Well, you did get my cigarettes they were indispensable. An the good Dolien, my secretary. You do remember her? My coffee was always there. But one morning I didn't had the chance to drink it. A certain Mr. Winkler did wait for me. I didn't know him. It was important to him to speak with me alone. In a private matter. "Very private ", he added. I showed him the Institute. First the laboratory. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning, Hoesch. Did you check the probes? Yes! Number 99 shows good results. - very good. The antibiotic effect is 10% over the average. We can use it for the mutation experiments then. Yes. How long do you want to radiate them? - Oh, start with 5 minutes. Here. - Thank you. Well, Hoesch, in another row you can let examine your rabbit blood. Good morning, Schake. - Good morning, Doctor. Only the rabbits do listen here. - Maxe does wait for you already. But Doctor! - Yes. What's up? Ah ok! You know, no smoking here. Sorry, colonel, just one moment. Certainly. That's interesting. Yes it is. Our little Maxi is a very interesting one. Don't let him die. Right, Maxi? at least not before we have finished our experiments. Doctor, I can't see blood. It's more harmless than it looks. Just a little bit from the ventricle. Maxi is used to it, hm? - I really can't see any blood. It's ok with people, but not with such innocent animals. So, everting's allright. It's over, you can go home again. So Mr. Winkler, how was your first operation? Very well, thanks. - Not much worse than human blood? Schake, please do me a favor? Take the blood into the Sereologic Institute. You can clean the desk later! Dear hevaen - so much blood. Is that all from the little rabbits? Not only rabbits, there also some guinea pigs. That's Schakes work desk. Finally we can talk. Hoesch, leave us alone for a moment, yes? I'll join you later. What's up? Something urgent? Pardon me, Colonel? - All right. Now you're there. I'd have asked for Hoesch nonetheless You know each other. - Yes. Well, there you have it doctor. Then we already were close to the core of the issue then. You could have thought that our Institute is for defense. Defense? - but Doctor! You did notice that the times aren't normal? What defense? counterintelligence of course. - Of course. Tell me: who's protecting me? You? That's right. I'm colonel Winkler and responsible for the Institute. Do you know what's going on, Doctor? No, you can't. You're in trouble. And experiment with your new probe. You know what? The results are already known in London. Hard to believe, what? - Yes. Yes, I know. But here are the charts and the instructions. Now listen, Doctor. We don't want to make a big deal out of this. Honestly, we have cold feets. Very cold feets. We all failed. But what you did, that's impossible. Taking home war ducuments and with a young girl, who knows you well, dictating to a machine. Who do you mean? - Mrs Hermann! But you know that her father lives in Stockholm. - Yes I know. And the whole stuff went over Stockholm to London. Do you have proof? Mrs Herman did tell, but exactly in the wrong situation. Of course without a clue. Dr. Rothe is engaged to Mrs.Hermann. - Oh. Pardon. Yes, my dear Doctor, don't believe that let's say, i'm very fond of these direct methods. Anyhow: You're warned. That was the purpose of my visit. Hoesch, bring me to the car. Good bye, Doctor. - Good bye. Mrs. Hermann isn't that the lady with the funny letters, which you showed me. Unbelievable! Dr. Rothe and such a slut? Dr. Rothe? I wanted to tell you: It couldn't be avoided, to tell you the facts... Doctor? - yes. You did promise me that i can leave at 7 today. - Yes. Your coat. Dr. Rothe? - Yes? What did you want to tell me? I owe you an explanation. About Mrs Hermann. Now you know, that it's part of my job, to be informed about everything here in the institute. That strange London-Stockholm-story... did lead me inevitably, from you to Mrs Hermann. Inevitably,? - Yes. Believe me, it wasn't my intension. But Mrs Hermann did fit very well with my plans... It would be better if you wouldn't make any illusions. The girl isn't worth it, Doctor. This spy case is ridiculous, and we have slowed down it quite a bit. She can do what she wants. You'll have to talk to her of course. No problem, I'll tell her like it is. I prefer that. I'll call you tonight, if you need me. Don't worry because of Inge, Doctor. There's only one thing to do: Finish it, simply finish it! How's that possible? Dr. Rothe and such a slut. Don't worry about them. There's only one thing to do: Finish it, simply finish it! You're late today. I'm starving. I did wait for you. Good evening, Karl. Sorry that i'm eating already. I have to go to Poppenb?ttel. Yes, mother wants to see if she gets a few potatoes. What's up with him? Do you think it's because of me... No. I'll miss my bus. I'll go now, lngelein. I'll be back at 10.30. Good night, lngelein. Ah, there you are. where have you been? Ingelein, give the mile to the cat. But let the milk cool down first, if it's too hot. Got it? Got it, lngelein? - Yes. But lngelein. I only told you that you should give the milk to the cat. What's wrong? - Nothing, sorry. But Ingelein, you don't have to excuse yourself. I didn't meant it that way. - Of course not! You don't have to tell me that! You never care! Pshh. - don't "Pshh" me! I know, the neighbours. that's what you care about. I can die here. - the cat has to have something. Of course, as long as the cat has it's milk and Dr. Rothe his lunch. but what about me? That deosn't matter at all! Say something. What can I say? There's nothing to say. Then I realized that she talked. What she talked was a confession. that's how women confess: admit, more admit and more admit Only the one important thing, that is withhold. At least it was a confession, She told me about you, Hoesch. She wanted reconciliation. she got it I think. Suddenly something happened.. The phone rang. It suddenly was as if they were all in the room in person. Don't pick up. We simply aren't at home. Yes? Hoesch. Well yes... but it wasn't my fault. He didn't want to talk to me but to you. Let him be. Well. It coudn't be reversed. Never again. I still don't know why and how it happened. I didn't know a thing, believe me. Sure. You weren't yourself. Simply didn't attend, hm? What's the problem? Do you have any doubts? No. if you say so. - I say so. Well and then... then.. Then I had something in my hands, i belive. Yes... I played with it, without knowing what it was. Yes, and when I was conscious again, A lot of time must have passed. I heard voices. outside in the hall. Children, I have to go to Hollemanns. There are no potatoe in Poppenb?ttel. Yes, the bag. I won't frighten the Hollemans with my back pack. Ah... Karl? Just go in. Hoesch wants to talk to you. Doctor, what going on? I tried to call you. I dont understand. What's going on? There we have it. You on the sofa, the body in front of you. What a situation! Others would have squealed you, but not me. I knew it immediately. Who is it? - Well, the State. It was clear, something must happen. And it did happen. Do you remember? Two phone calls, the rescue action was started, Half an hour later Colonel winkler was there. Do this without a sound. Sooner or later we would have take care of Hermann but this way she comes to an normal funeral. Colonel, the police. By the way, Hoesch, don't think that I like your methods. Good night, Colonel. - We'll handle this: department 4. Please make your report. You take care of the papers. Clearly suicide. why does a human want to hang? Or what else there is You and your justice fanatism, what's that worth in reality? Only feelings. And that for woman who's out of question. Engaged with a man like you and sleeps with the man next door. Hoesch did you a favor, Dr. Rothe! Your antiquated ethical lifestyle doesn't fit in these times. IS that right, Hoesch? - Yes, Colonel. Just do you experiments. Keep on working and get along with the fact that you're still alive. Inge Hermann, born September the 3rd, 1919 in Hamburg, Magdalenenstra?e 1 7, death am December the 8th, 1943. Diagnosis: suicide strangulation with a belt. Number: AZ 1384-43. The body can be burried. From murder to suicide. and nobody asked. Even Mrs.Hermann didn't ask. Good evening, Karl. - Good evening, Mrs Hermann. I forgot to get some beer. Perhaps... you want to go to a restaurant. Yes, I wanted to go away. - The button isn't fixed. Karl? I did pack your stuff already. Thank you. Karl, where do you want me to send the post? I'll tell you. The bill is on the desk. Gas- and power is deducted until today. The rest is there too. - Mrs Hermann... Don't say anything. I know you can't stay here with all your memories. I can understand this. I don't want you to persuade, but... i'm an old woman. Inge is gone, and now you... I can't stand it seeing you leaving. Do you want me to play the role of the dead in your life? Anyhow, somehow she made it. I didn't leave, I lived together with her, but it was the opposite of what I wanted one survives. - Don't you understand? I couldn't. I wasn't allowed to! Do you have an idea what you did? To let me live? It was war. Thousands died every day, we wanted to spare one. Me, of all people. - You were lucky that it was you! I'm always lucky. - Yes, of course. Well, life went on. Also in the institute. You remember. Strange. Sometimes I was quite in a good mood. Hey, Hoesch, come here. Have a look at this. you can among all these germs... remember 3 of them, or? Well, give them a name then. Call the first Colonel Winkler, the second Hoesch and the third Rothe. That's easy, or? but if you inject a single winkler, Hoesch or Rothe, in the blood of a healthy body, he'll go ill. He'll die like a dog. By the way, when I did take your eyepiece out of the desk drawer Is it yours? - Yes. Nice. You don't have to get so close to the patient to give an injection. Is it here to indicate our personal relationship? No, it's always there. These things make the suite baggy. My connections are good for some cigarettes, but a new suite... I also don't get one without a special paper Doctor? Do you take me with you? - I did promise it. Good bye, Doctor. - Come. Good evening. Good evening. Excuse me. Is this your seat? Yes, that's my seat. - Excuse me. No problem. by the way may name is Rothe, Karl. - Ursula. I am Ursula. Ursula. That's a nice name. Ursula how? - weber. Ursula weber. i live here since today. - you live here? It's no my fault. Am I on the right seat now? - No, that's Mrs Hermanns seat. Please stay, she won't come for dinner anyway Maybe you want to pour me some tea. - You're welcome. She always does that. Here's your cup. - Thank you. Your letter. Do you want to read it? - No, better not. Yes, please. Pardon my intrusion. Terrible. The pen must work It's important. I have to write some letters. - That's important. I hate writing letters. I always slide it back. I hope you don't mind. - No, not at all. It's nice here. So many books. I'm sure you like reading. I don't think writing letters is real work. You surely have important things to do? - Yes, very important. I do disturn. I knew it. I always have the wrong seat. My mother alwys told me: "Ursel, you have two left hands"... and two left legs. Really. I can't see them. Are you from Hamburg? - No, i'm from G?rlitz. I was transfered. I'm a teacher at the Einsp?ttler school. You're very young. - There are some nowadays, who are much younger. You're also not from Hamburg? You surely know many people here. Then you don't realize. - what? My talk does disturb you. - No, not at all. Sit down. Do you want some coffee? - real coffee? Not quite, but... almost. Yes. Here you are. - Thank you. It's strong. Special ration? No, I have good connections. But you only get one cup. Otherwise you'll have two pair a left hands and legs. - For sure. Since when do you live here? - About two years. I did see Mrs Hermann for the second time, but that I can tell you: i don't like here much. Yes, I know. But life goes on. At first I didn't want to move in, then I told to myself: The room can't be empty. That's superstition, or? Yes. why did she kill herself? i mean she was 24. I'm 22, i couldn't do that. Well... what do you get out of life when you're young? Here's your pen. - thank you. how can I return this favor? Oh yes! My mother did send me gingerbread. Selfmade and fresh! There's a bar, they have liquor. Money first. - Come, you can count on me. Stop it. Go home, you're full. I'm no bank. Here's the money. Here. - Dog leather is great. My wife made a bag out of it. - Dog leather? no. That's nothing. They make lady slippers out of fishes. It has to be one with a short fell otherwise it looses hair. Don't you see that the fellow isn't interested in woman? Go away! he pesters people when he's drunk I hardly know him. She dosn't know me. - This is not a good bar. I like it. - I'm not often here. Do we leave or have another drink? - I have to leave. Another drink for the lady. Something's the matter with you. - Nothing important. One can't be always in swing You don't have to be afraid of me. I'm not afraid. Don't talk bullshit when i'm with a client. She doesn't know me. - Closing time! She didn't think that someone bites. - time that you get a hold. Well yeah. So, here's my room. The switch is behind you. Turn on the light. You're funny. do you want to stay in front of the door in darkness? Hey, what's wrong with you? Damn! That's who you are. I knew it. Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Help! Help! Police! Help! Murderer! Light! Turn on the light! Police! My keys! Police! - Why the shouting? There is a many on my door! - Aren't you used to this? No, it's a murdere. A murderer! A killer! I tell you, there's a killer. A killer. I just looked him in the eyes, and I noticed how he stares. Alarm? - No but on the fifth floor... Can you see something? Maybe in the attic? werner! werner, please come out. Excuse me. It's a bit embarrasing Well. Poor girl, nothing to eat... Had a few drinks, a few too many. Unfortunately. why didn't you ask who he is? - She always has trouble with the guys. Good evening. - Good evening. Excuse me, what did you do to her? Nothing. I only payed the liquor That is no crime, or? She would deserve to get beaten, though. Don't get beaten! Pretending you were... You 're just drunk and you're always drunk Damn, my keys. no, that's a murderer. Yes... now I know. I didn't had the guts to believe and she did shout at me: "Murderer. " But I was save. I wanted to go home. Wait, I have to go with you! Stop! I thought i'll miss it. That's the last one, or? Yes, the last one. I have to go to terminal. We have been bobed out in Rothenburg. Do you have a light? - we have to get off. So, you can go to your seat now. Give me a light. I know you. I don't know where from but I know you. That's funny, I know this face. Are you from Uelzen? I know him. That's true. Have you been to Sterkerode? No. - Come into the light. leave him alone, he doesn't know you, right? Of course he doesn't know me I'm just a little man, nobody knows the little man. But i, I know you. Do you know me? - No. He doesn't know me, she doesn't know me, nobody knows me. So, do you know me? - No. there you have it. Nobody knows me. there you have it. I didn't know that the train is heated. Pardon, they aren't so luxurious in the fifth year of war. Now I know where you are from. Sure, if you don't want to talk to me. Do what you want. Young lady, do you know me? terrible such an vulgar man. Look. Nice, or? Do you want too? Yes, that's nice. I did queue up one hour for this. There are no toys for the kids. I also have two kids, two boys. It's not easy, in the war without a husband. My husnband Heinz is since '38 in the army. 6 years. - A long time. I feel hot! Yes and he comes for 8 days vacation each year. That isn't much. What do you want now? Don't you see that I talk to this man? It could be a mistake but... Leave me alone! - I have seen these eyes once. Don't make trouble here! - Can't be a mistake I know these eyes... - Leave me alone! Take it easy. How pushy some people are. Doesn't he realize that you don't know him? Of course I don't know him. - How should somebody like you know such a person? There we have it! Alarm! air-raid warning! All to the bunker. We have to leave or we have to stand. I'll stay. Anybody in here? Right. if you get it, you get it. we move. out of the station. we move. you know, I was very frightened in the past but not anymore. because you don't live anymore if you are always frightened. I'm not frightened anymore. Can I have a light? Can I have a light? All aboard! All aboad! Departure! My escape was in vain. I wasn't escaped. I didn't want to, but still did do it. And I walked through the night. Blind, deaf... and lost. I only had one wish. To sleep. But when I came home, somebody already slept there. Mrs Hermann, her cat on her lap. Why didn't she go to bed? Because she awaited me with her dreadful care. Dear heaven, I fell asleep. Some more, Karl? I didn't had any luck in Poppenb?ttel. Half a pound butter and two breads. Half a pound! Did you hear Karl? - Did I hear what? I didn't ask for anything. - I just... I didn't want to disturb you. - You never want to disturb me. I'll make you something. - I didn't ask for anything.! Pssh, we're no alone here. - Yes, you're right. Inge is right. One suffocates here! Yes. Yes, yes. If only the cat has it's milk. Inge? I... You always were very good to me. Excuse me. - Don't. Do you have a cold? I did see Mrs Hermann for the last time. Suicide is cowardly. There was no escape. I didn't want you to get my work. No, it should vanish with me. That's why I went into the Institute. Then... I wanted to end it all. Hey, you! Wake up! Wake up, Wake up, Wake up! Damn you! You can sleep long enough! Did you ever understand, why i'm still alive, hm? because of an cigarette. At that time I wanted one, not now. That's why i'm still alive. Anyway... All my documents and charts everything burned. Finished. All I wanted then was a cigarette. And I didn't had any. But I remembered where I could find some In your desk drawer. Very simple. I broke it. I found some. I also found some other things Like these funny letters from Inge, which you showed to colonel Winkler With one of those letters I did light up my cigarette. Yes... Of course I took also something else. I thought of you. You should not survive, Hoesch. No, no. The whole thing was mysterious. The light of the radiation machine... flickered every few seconds, and I thought how I can get you. A single time in my life in wanted to kill with intention and I needed a gun. Well... These make baggy a suit baggy. Yes, yes. That was clear - you had to go with me. But where were you? I had to think quick. I saw the official car outside. I was looking for you. At home, in the office, Finally at Winkler. I had some business with him anyway No, I was looking for you. I did hear from your visit. You weren't at home. I found that funny. Then I went to the lnstitute. I knew it all along. And there I found your traces. The whole mess in the washbasin, my broken drawer. Notes gone, revolver gone. Then I realized! You asked for Winkler in the office. So I thought you were there. Right. I drove there. It didn't matter in this moment. I wanted tokill you. You with my gun... very embarassing. But I had no time for you. Duty first. We had alert stage 9 this evening. Big deal! A general Hauff was arested. In Berlin. He talked. He also had his allies in Hamburg. All swells. but where? Without you I woudn't have find out. But thanks to you it was my big evening! Only thanks to you. You showed me the way Parole Babylon. The whole story did sound like a detective novel. I laughed. Now in knew the trick and i dared to go into this strange world. Because I thought you were there. Parole Babylon. This way, please. You can leave your coat here. May I smoke? - Oh, no problem. Babylon... It worked. I was in the house, in a strange mood. Like a boy. Like a boy who played hide and seek. Of course I thought that you were in the room next door, Hoesch. That was a mistake, Doctor. Now the best: Do you know where we hide the poison? I don't get it, why should the bosses have the heroic death in their pockets? "To the heroic death in the pockets". Don't laugh. I don't have to remind you that we are all in danger after Hauff's arrest. If he would have had the poison, We'd know if our names are known. who could stand a questioning in the Prinz-Albrecht-street? With the effective methods of our dear Hoesch? No thanks! No, I honestly prefer my 08er for suicide. It worked fine so far. I made a mistake. You couldn't belong to them, Hoesch. See, see. Winkler, i was wrong I about him. He is a very receptive person. I find this panic a bit hysteric - No time for feelings here. In our situation our private affairs are quite silly. We have to act immeditately. Who knows how much time we have left. Marquart, you leave tonight as a messenger. Thank you, Colonel. The car from Bremen waits at 5 o'clock aat the Seegartenbr?cke. What's going? Why does no one answer the phone? Yes, hello? Hoesch? What's going on? Can't this wait until tomorrow? dear heaven, my wife is seriously ill! You know that! what? who? Dr. Rothe? No, Dr. Rothe isn't here. Yes, Colonel, i'm here. Good evening. - Good evening. Are you crazy? What's Dr. Rothe doing here in the middle of the night? What on earth do you want? Why did you get in? Very simple. Babylon. What? He stole the gun? He must be crazy. No, no, here. Yes, i'm listening. Give it to me. You're too nervous. But I need it later. Yes, of course i'm listening. What's going on? You did send two officers? You're worried about my security? Very nece but i'll see you tomorrow! of all people Hoesch. That goes to your account. - Yes, Yes. Why are you here? - Very simple. I came to shot Hoesch. And you. - And? Now I don't want to shoot you anymore - Very nice. Lilly, Hoesch did send two officers. Let them in. Without password! They don't belong to us. There they are. You caused some trouble. - You too caused some trouble once for me. If it's against Hoesch, i'm with you. There we are Colonel. - Good evening. One moment. I have a visitor, Dr. Rothe, please. Yes, thank you. - Next door. Enjoy yourself. Nothing could be done. There was an alarm in the next moment. Damn. It was very dramatic. Here your tracker dogs, and over there the accomplices. But there were even better things.. The head of state was kidnapped by paratroopers. A Minister escaped by plane I don't know what else. What else i'll go through this night, Is almost harmless compared to this. Winkler had a plan. The ambulance was standing by, to bring his wife into the hospital. Instead of her he decided to smuggle oout the messenger and to fool the officers. but my officers weren't fooled. Especially thin M?ller The story get more funny. - Yes. And then you saw something. I'll try to call Hoesch. Winkle and hie friends didn't had a clue. An the hours went by. and then I fell asleep. It was dawn. The city still was hoping for sounding of the all-clear. Winkler didn't want to waint longer His friends left the house one by one. we were faster! When the air-raid was coming to an end, i already took all precautions. Dr. Rothe, it's time. - I'm not a murderer. Pardon. I didn't sleep for a long time. broken crockery brings luck. Yes, i'm ready. Moment. Farewell, Marquart. Everything will be allright. Yes, Elisabeth, it'll be allright In 4 weeks everything will be over. Doktor, let's go. Nurse, thank you. The house was surrounded. We did get them one by one. Only the main allies were missing. But what was that with the ambulance? I did let him go at first. I saw the whole thing from the otherside Then the hunt was on! Something must have happend. Why isn't the car here? Damn. You, to the left! three men to the left! Stop! . That's how it looks when grown-ups play hide and seek. but when I turned around Colonel Winkler was gone. He left his gun, without saying good bye But his final words, i remember exactly. He said: "For Hoesch". They must not find it here with me! I woud have been easier for Winkler. Why? He would have brought this to an end. What do you think what he had to tell us I thought he... - I just said so. Hi didn't! We got him. When he escaped to swiss. We did hang him, The colonel winkler. We didn't look for you anymore. You were dead for us. And here you are. Yes. I tell you, you are always lucky. Doctor, admit it! Well. Unbelievable. The bomb night was over, thousands were dead. Thousands who wanted to live. But i, I was still alive. Unbelievable. Again I only had one wish: back home. but when I came to Magdalenenstreet... There was no Magdalenenstreet anymore.. Anybody home? Can you do me a favor? Can you read that? I can't. fume poisoning. And please write: " at Zillich". We now live in Hollstock. My wife and I did loose everything. everythings lost. Do you know what happened to Mrs Herrmann? All gone! Mrs Herrmann, Mrs weber, Dr. Rothe. It's their own fault. Why didn't they go in the bunker? Yes, it's their own fault. Well, Dr. Rothe was dead without dying. At that time it was easy to get papers. So I became Dr. Neumeister. Doctor in the refugee camp Elbe-D?venstett. Well. I maybe thought, that the past was buried in the ruins of Magdalenenstreet. until you came here this afternoon, to vaccinate. Then I realized that there is no leaving behind. There is no. It doesn't work. I don't have time to get excited! Don't you understand? one has to know one's stuff. And know when the right time to jump is. I did always manage to jump at the right time. What do I care for? For you, winkler, ?for lnge Hermann, ?for me? That's nonsense. It's all nonsense. You don't have the guts, you amateure. You are not able to shoot. Maybe I can. Jump now. That's yours. They are yours too.
