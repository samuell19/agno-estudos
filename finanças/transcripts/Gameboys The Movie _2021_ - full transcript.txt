Come on, guys! Oh yeah, I still got game. Hang on... We already have 800 live viewers! Thank you so much, guys! If we reach a thousand, I'll give you some freebies. Promise! So, don't be shy to give me some stars. Support my gaming channel, please! What the... What a pro move! Looks like I'm going to lose... Baby, put on your shirt! Why, baby? Do I look terrible? Shut up! I'm on live stream! OK. Baby… Baby... - Go away, baby... - But I can't get enough of you! Crazy! My viewers might get turned off! Look, baby! - I already have a thousand live viewers! - See! I told you! Hi, guys! CaiReel Nation, how are you doing? CaiReel Nation? What's that? They're our supporters, baby! - You mean 'my' supporters? - Go ahead. - Ask them if they don't want me here. - They don't care. They're only loyal to me. Am I right, guys? - Seriously? - Yes! - For real? - Yes! OK, CaiReel Nation, if you want me to leave already, click the 'angry' emoji. You know the drill, guys! - Click 'angry' - Click 'angry'! Go! If you want me to kiss my baby, click the 'heart' emoji. - Hey! - What? Go, go! Do you see those emojis, baby? That's a lot of hearts! - The angry emojis are just about to appear! - But it's nothing compared to my love for you. Wait for the angry emojis! Come on! Your viewers might think that you can't keep your word. Think about your 1,200 viewers. What now? Fine! Just a smack on the cheek, OK? Sure, let's have the main event later. You're such a jerk! There you go! Baby! Baby! Yes! Baby! I told you so! (Gameboys The Movie) Do that again and you're dead! Stop it, baby! What are you doing? I'm sorting whites and coloreds before washing them. Is that how it should be? JUST IN: IATF to announce new quarantine regulations as the numbers of COVID-19 positive cases rise. You're being a pest, baby! I could get used to waking up with this view. Really?! Baby! That's disgusting! I'm in the middle of a game! Is this yours? Yes. Hey! You're such a perv! Why? I was just checking! It's my used boxers! So it's yours? Yes! You bugger! Hey, baby! Give it back to me! That's mine! You're so nasty! Will you help me do the laundry? Yuck! You're so gross! Let me wipe it. It smells so bad! Do you even brush your teeth? Nice, you're doing good. What happened? Here, wear this. Go. Silly. Business operations allowed in ECQ, MECQ and GCQ areas but public encouraged to stay at home. Stop smelling it! - I don't want to, baby! - Fine! Ouch! Give me a kiss! Give it to me, baby! Let's stop this! I've had enough. OK. Ouch! You spank so well, baby. - Hanging our clothes but my baby left me hanging. - Baby? - Hanging our clothes but my baby left me hanging. - What the?! You know what, I'm done with this! Hold on, baby! Baby! Are you tired, baby? Yes, but not too tired. Do you do this everyday? Yes, but not in one day. I only do the laundry once a week. Did you like it, baby? Am I now fit to be a husband? It's not even a requirement. I know. Baby, I'll give you my share for groceries, OK? No need, baby. Just save it up for a new computer. I'll take care of our expenses. I'm embarrassed. Let me share the expenses with you. We'll do that once we start living together. But for now, let me take care of you. I want to take care of you. If you insist. I can't change your mind anyway. OK. But the day isn't over yet. What else do we need to do? You're not yet tired, right? You're being annoying again, baby. Why? What's on your mind? Stop it, Gavreel. I'll just do some push-ups. Count with me, OK? One… Two… Baby! Three… Four… Stop it, baby! - Five… - Silly! Sex! I mean, six! Six! Six… Seven… Idiot! You're an idiot! I will miss you. What's with the drama? I'm just glad that we have this time together. Good thing your mom allowed you to stay with me. Fine. Are you ready? Ready for what? I said I'm fine with cuddling… and a bit of kissing. OK. Oops! Take a bath first. Take a bath first! But baby... Am I smelly already? Baby, we're both sweaty. Go and take a bath first! Fine, let's take a bath together. No way! We might end up doing something else. Well, you have a point. OK, I'll go first. I'll be quick, OK? Baby… It's your turn. If I could have a s superpower, I want to have the power to disappear. The worst thing about this pandemic is that it traps us in the very situation we tried so hard to avoid. Is he going through something? Thinking what would be my next step. What is he up to this time? Hi, baby boy! Hi, your highness! How are you? Still pretty, as always! Where is your baby? Wait, I'll call him. Baby, our girl is here! Come over here! Faster! Hello, your highness! Wow, too busy to join our call? Drop the call and come over here! No way! I don't want to stand in the way of your love-making. You're too much, Pearl! Look, I understand if you're doing it every hour! You haven't seen each other for a long time and baby boy will have to go home soon. Just remember this: Safety first before you thirst. You're talking too much, girl! What's wrong?! It's just normal to... Wait, don't tell me… Well, I mean, it's OK if you're not yet ready, right? Love's not all about sex, anyway. Of course. And I am always willing to wait. How about you? How are you? You're going to tell us something, right? Hold on, we're still waiting for another guest. Who's that guest? Are we going to be in trouble again? Of course not! He's in the waiting room now. I'll let him in. Hi! Hi, girl! Hi, Gav! Who is that baby boy? Such a cutie! Yes, he is. He's my baby. He's Cairo. Hello! Hi! In fairness, you look good together. Such cuties. I wish I also have my own guy. By the way, let me introduce myself. My name is Achilles, but you can call me Chill, spelled as C-H-I-L-L, but pronounced as 'kill, ' like 'Kill This Love.' Kidding! Since when did you call yourself Chill? Just now! You've got a problem with that?! That's a gorgeous name. I'm already liking your new baby boy, Gav. He's way better than your ex, that jerk and manipulative guy. Kidding! Girl, why are you so bitter? Tell us the story! Spill the tea! No, I'm just kidding. I just got carried away. So what now, Pearl? Have you informed them already? Not yet. What is this all about? Pearl and I are planning to work on a project, a raunchy one. Kidding! Basically, we plan to donate tablets to students. Wow, that's a good project! I agree. What can we help you with? We already have sponsors, and we just need help distributing the tablets to deserving students. Count me in! How about you, baby? Game! All right! We'll just inform you of the details soon. Game. Hold on, I'll just take this call. OK. Baby boy, what's up with you and Gav? The Collab that nobody asked for. Charot! I'll wait. I always wait, anyway. Kidding! The sun is already up. Did you forget about me? Kidding! I'm sorry. I was in another call. With whom? Your new boyfriend? Achi… I'm sorry. Looks like everyone has already moved on. I need to move on as well. (Confirm Block) And this is how I move on. (You've blocked Terrence Carreon. We're sorry that you've had this experience.) Be careful, baby. Ready? Hang on. - What's this? - Hang on. Make sure that I won't fall or else... You already did, baby, and you fell right in my arms! - You're so corny. - Don't look! Hang on. Walk slowly, baby. OK… Slowly, baby. Are you excited, baby? What's this for? We're here. Surprise! Wow! It looks nice. Why aren't you surprised, baby? Because I already saw you working on that a while ago. We live in the same house, remember? I was looking for you earlier. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to ruin your surprise. My baby doesn't want me to get disappointed. Of course! What is this for, anyway? I promised that I'd date you after the pandemic, right? But I couldn't wait any longer. And besides, I know that you won't be here for long, that's why I wanted our movie date to be special. I wanted this moment to be special, baby. Thank you, baby, for always making me feel special. It makes me feel guilty that I am not as affectionate as you. Baby, you're special to me. OK? In your short stay here, you made me feel special too. Of course, because I love you. My baby is crushing on me. Stop it! You're annoying! How much did you spend for all these? Not much. I bought that popcorn a month ago. All right. What are we going to watch? Choose what you want, baby. Perhaps a horror movie so you could hug me when you get scared? You're being silly again! Let's just watch a rom-com. So you could fall deeply for me, baby? OK, how about a family movie? So you could start a family with me? Fine! Let's just watch a series or animé! It's up to you, baby. What's wrong with you! Hold on. Hold on, baby. Pick a movie first. I'll just take this call. Sure, go ahead. I'm sorry, Aunt Myra. I'm in the middle of something. I'll just call you back. Baby… Baby… Baby! Let's focus on the movie. I can multitask, baby. We're outside, someone might see us. Let's give them a show. Baby… - Someone's at the door. - What? Don't mind it. I'm serious, baby. The doorbell is ringing! I didn't hear anything. Baby, let me check it first. - Maybe that's just Pearl. - Hang on, OK? That girl is so annoying! Baby! Just a second! Pearl, is that you? Baby! Don't open it yet. Wait for me. Baby! Terrence… Hi, love birds. What are you doing here? You're not even wearing a face mask... I'm sorry. Baby, I'll just lay him down. What's wrong with you, Terrence?! Right here! Dad! I'm sorry, dad! Sorry if I like boys. Dad! Mom, please... - Don't send me away, mom, please. - Terrence... - Dad! - You're having nightmares, Terrence. - Dad! - Terrence! Are you OK? I'll get him a glass of water. Look... I know… I know that what you're going through is difficult. Gav and I are just here for you, OK? OK? Thank you Gavreel and Cairo for saving me. Gav, where are you? I already started jogging since you were both still asleep. All right. Cai and I will follow since he's already up. OK. FITNESS FIRST B4 YOU THIRST ESTE SAFETY FIRST B4 YOU THIRST Is this… Hey. Gav? I thought I was already lost! What are you doing here? Hey, where have you been? I wish I didn't run too far. What's wrong, baby? I bumped into this clown. What? I mean, we have a visitor. Hi, boss! Master! What are you doing here? Oh god, it's a long story! Hey, hello! Hi. You know each other, right? - Yes. - No. Which is which? How did you know my address? His brother London gave it to me. But why are you here? How did you get here? And no offense, but I think you should quarantine first. Stay away from him, baby. Hold on, calm down! OK, we were quarantined after I got to the airport. I got my test results and it's negative, so I was allowed to go. OK, I'm sorry, but what brings you here? Let me get some rest. I'm tired. I want to fix my things first. So where's my bedroom? I already gave the vacant room to Terrence. Unless you're OK to be roommates with him? - No! - Sure! Looks like he doesn't want to, Master. So I'll be sleeping on the sidewalk then. Well, it's not like I'm paying rent. Go ahead, use the room. I'll just sleep on the couch. Come on, I just told you that I am Covid-negative. Here's the result. Look! It's up to you, guys. Just figure it out. Hi, baby boys! - Hi, Achilles! - What's up? So Cai, Gav, are you available to join our event? Pearl told me that you do video coverage, Cai. - Is it OK if I assign you that task? - Yes, of course. You, too, Gav! Join us, OK? Pearl and I need more help. Sure, even if my task is to just babysit my baby. Seriously?! Right in front of my salad?! - Sorry. - Why are you laughing? You've seen the video, too? I knew it! It's just a meme, right? But it's fine, there's nothing wrong if you've seen it. Anyway, I should hang up, you guys are making me envious. Bye, guys. Bye, Achilles! See you! Bye! See you! I'll give you one star. Reason? Happy couple! Not that I'm bitter, I'm just after self-care. Kidding! (Terrence Carreon) (User Blocked) Should I unblock this jerk? No! Chill! Don't be a hopeless romantic. Before you go, can I say something? What is it this time, Terrence? Anybody can fall for you. Maybe the timing wasn't right for us. Whatever! Will you stop getting near me? There's so much space around! I just want to be close to you, isn't it obvious? Isn't it obvious? I don't want to do anything with you. Come on, I'm making an effort here. That's what you're good at. Why does it sound like a bad thing? Do you think what you did was good? Let me make it up to you. I can't stand seeing us like this. I don't hear an apology. You want me to apologize for being honest? No! For leading me on! You flirted with me like you really cared. But when I entertained you, you told me you weren't ready yet? And then you just disappeared. Now you'd show up like nothing happened? - OK, I'm sorry, I messed up. - You led me on! Can we just forget about it and be real friends this time? I can't believe you. This is me saying sorry. I really want us to be OK. You're so stupid for a genius. You look so sexy when you're mad. I'm not playing this game with you again. Calm down, Mr. Boredom. What do you want? What are you doing? Is this what you want? What? Let's go upstairs. Silly! (Tita Myra Calling) Good evening, Sir Vic. I'd just like to follow up on your rent. Thanks. I'm coming, hang on! Aunt Susan? Who else would it be? No need! We're in a pandemic, we need to observe social distancing. Baby, is that the item that I ordered? Who is he? Why are you letting strangers inside the house? He's Cairo. Hello. He's my friend. Oh… your friend. You've chosen your friends well. You kinda look alike. By the way, can you help carry my stuff? I really have to pee. Excuse me. Please be careful with the eggs. Don't break them, OK? Baby… Baby? I thought I was just a friend. I'll explain myself later. OK. Friend! Come on, baby. Baby, don't get mad! Why did you lie? Last I checked, you were proud that I'm your baby. But when it comes to your folks, I'm just your friend? I'm proud of you, and you know that. It's just that Aunt Susan can be difficult. I don't think she'd understand. And besides, she won't be here for long. I don't want us to get in trouble. OK? Baby… Baby… OK, fine! I still don't get it, but fine! Thank you, baby. You're welcome… Friend! Come on, baby. Baby! What's wrong? Don't worry. I came from our church's conference and they swabbed us twice. That's why I thought of dropping by. Is that so? What brings you here? Your Aunt Myra asked me to. I also brought your favorite coconut pie. Hand it to me. Here you go. For you. Thank you. Gav, I heard you weren't answering your Aunt Myra's calls. She's worried about you, especially during this pandemic. I kept on missing her calls. I'll just call her later. Yes, you should. Also, I dropped by your apartment units. Why is Vic still there? He always forgets to pay the rent, right? Your Grandma Cora had a hard time dealing with him. He does pay when he is able. It's just hard for him to comply because of the pandemic. That won't cut it, Gav. We are all hit hard by this pandemic. OK. By the way, do we have rice already? I'll cook. Let me do it, baby... Bro… Let me do it, bro. He'll do it. You got a good friend. Wait, do you let girls inside this house? No, that's never going to happen. Why do you say so? Because of the pandemic. We're after our safety. Right. You have a point. Wait up, Terrence! Why do you keep on chasing me? Because I might get lost! - Hey, Mr. Boredom! - Stop calling me that! OK, but you can call me Seven-Incher anytime. You think you're funny? OK, just let me catch my breath first. You know what, I don't get you. Why are you such a flirt? Ouch! I said I just wanted to breathe first. I admit I have a bad reputation. But I've never flirted with anyone here, except with you. And that's because I... Because? Maybe because I... I like you. Déjà vu. What? I heard those words before. You already told me that and yet here we are. I'm sorry for being an asshole. I deserve this kind of treatment because of what I did to you. But don't I deserve a second chance? OK, but you're not ready to commit, right? That's why you have an alter account, so you can flirt with anyone! I have an alter account because I can't be my true self in the real world! You know what I'm talking about. Alter guys don't expect anything from me. You know that I don't want to be a doctor, right? Yes, I do. But you also don't know what you want, right? I know I like you, but I don't get the things that I like just because I like them. Everything that I have, all the things that I do are my parents' choices. And that's because of what? I have an IQ of over 140? I'm sorry. I didn't know what you're going through. Gav, why did you set up for five? Do we have guests for today? Those are for my boarders, Aunt Susan. Who are they? And why are they joining us for lunch? They are staying here, and they're my friends, too. Oh, OK. Go ahead. Thank you. Here they are. Good afternoon, ma'am. Good afternoon, ma'am. Good afternoon. Hello, ma'am. This is my Aunt Susan. - Aunt Susan, meet Terrence and Wesley. - Hello, ma'am. Take a seat and join us. So, you two are…? Come again? How are you related to each other? We are... Brothers? Because you kinda look alike. No, we're not. We are… friends! And classmates! - Am I right, bro? - Yes, bro! But you and Gav, you don't look alike. I know, because he's a distant relative. His mom was my cousin. But I am close with them. Oh, that's why. This tastes good! Had I known that your friends are here, I would have cooked more. Wait a minute, where is your girlfriend? Hey, easy with the food. Don't eat too fast. What's wrong? Is there something wrong with the food? Did I put too much pepper? It's delicious, that's why we were taking large bites. - They're just famished. - Good to know! As I was saying, where is your girlfriend? What's her name again? Oh, Pearl? It's been a long time since we broke up. I'm sorry to hear that. That girl is beautiful. That's just how it is. But we're still friends. Best friends, actually. That's good to hear! Do you know what that means? You still have a chance to get back together! When I heard that Gav already has a girlfriend, I felt so relieved! Why? You see, when he was a kid, he was such a softie. We thought he was going to grow up gay. - Please have more, Aunt Susan. - And what if he grew up as one? What do you mean? If he grew up gay, then it would be a disappointment! I remember telling his grandma, “You know what, that's just a phase.” Because Gav grew up with girls as his playmates. But at least I was proven wrong when he decided to have a girlfriend. Why feel disappointed? There's nothing wrong with being gay. I didn't mean it that way. In fact, I have a lot of gay friends in our church. They are fun to be with! They are good performers in our church activities. When I need to get my makeup done, I run to them for help. By the way, Gav, where will I sleep? Are you going to stay the night? Yes, and for a couple of days. Here's your pillow. Why did you have to rent out your grandma's room? Aren't you earning enough from your other tenants? They begged me to allow them, but it's only temporary. They're already looking for a new apartment. That's good to know. Have you thought about your Aunt Myra's request? She has been convincing you for so long, Gav. Yes, we've talked about it before. I want you to be near your family. I don't know what's keeping you from leaving. If you are worrying about who's going to take care of this house and the other apartments, then I'll take charge. My son Enzo can help me. I think our apartments need better supervision. All right. How's Enzo, by the way? Does he still see his child from his ex-girlfriend? Why did you ask? Nothing. I just thought about it. I'll go ahead. Note to self: Don't apologize for being who you are. Hey, baby boy! What happened? (Terrence Carreon) Where are you, Cai? I saw your post. Just getting some fresh air. Relax, OK? I get you, boss. It's so frustrating. I don't want to go out of our room because I feel like she's watching our every move. That's what I don't understand. Why does Gav have to pretend in front of her? I get where Gav is coming from, but that doesn't mean that I'll allow his aunt to insult us. Calm down, OK? Let's just give this one to Gav. But why? I also know the feeling of being in the closet. I just didn't expect this kind of reaction from Gav. Why is he putting up with her? He was the reason why I came out! And his aunt is going to stay here for days! I support you and Gav, but I'm not leaving this room while she's here. You're being supportive by doing that? Yes! I might not be able control my temper. That would be a bigger problem. You have a point. OK. Gav, we can't sleep together. But why, baby? Your aunt might see us. You're right, baby. Thank you for being so understanding. You can always talk to me about it, baby. I don't know why I reacted that way. I got so scared. What happened, baby? When I was a kid, Aunt Susan paid us a visit. She told grandma that she'd bring me to church. Grandma said yes. When we got to the church, do you know what happened? What? They prayed me over like I was possessed by a bad spirit. - What?! - I was so young then. I heard them say that I'd go to hell just because I'm gay, and that made me hate myself. I'm sorry, baby. I didn't know you went through that. Baby... You know what, I thought I was past it. My grandma showered me with love. She made me feel that there is nothing wrong with me. And there's nothing wrong with being gay. I was happy then. My grandma allowed me to be who I am. But when I saw Aunt Susan again, the bad memories came rushing back. Baby, I'm so sorry. Don't worry, we'll get rid of your bad memories. All of them, and then we'll replace them with happy and gay memories. For real, baby? Baby! Let's start making new memories, baby! Aunt Susan might see us! Just kidding, baby. Babes! Yes, your highness? Excited much? No, it's just that… What? My dad doesn't want to hold the fundraising event in our house. Can we just do it at your place? My dad will just sponsor our swab tests. Sure! Yay! Thanks! That's better. We'll get a lot of help. What do you mean? Terrence and Wesley are also staying with us. What?! Since when? Why? How? I have no idea. Awesome! Didn't know you're running an orphanage now. Are you the Mother Superior, Gav? Do you want to find another venue? I was just kidding! Come over here so we can have fun! Oh, yes! Definitely! I'm excited to hear some juicy stories... I mean, to catch up with you, guys! Stop it! Stop it! Baby! Ouch! Where are your boarders? Won't they be joining us for dinner? No, they won't. They ordered take-out. Such rich kids! You know what, I smell something fishy. What do you mean? I think they are not really friends. I think they are something else... Your food tastes so good, Aunt Susan! - Always a hearty meal! - Really? I'll give you my recipe. Yes, please. But don't change the topic. I'm really suspicious of those two. I think they're doing something horrifying in their room. Horrifying… Like what? Spirit of the Glass? - More horrifying than that. - Horrifying indeed! Charot! What? What kind of word is that? Stop using that word, Gavreel, others might think that you're... What's wrong? It only means 'joke.' It's not a swear word. Just don't use that word. And stop changing the topic! I know those two are doing inappropriate things in their room. Well, it's none of our business. Why not? What if they are doing disgusting things? That's too mean. This is your grandma's house. Shouldn't we respect her memory, Gav? And Gav, please be mindful next time. Choose your friends wisely, because you might end up like them! End up like what? Why do you keep butting in?! I just like asking questions. - I've noticed that, too! - Let's just eat. The food is getting cold. Come on, let's eat. You know what, Gav, I only say what's best for you. What if you become gay again? Listen to me. I'll take you both to church and have you talk to Pastor Eddie. I can't take this anymore. - Why? - Please, Cairo… What's happening? What now, Gav? Are you just going to tolerate her? She is insulting you and you just want us to keep quiet?! I'm not insulting you! I just want to help you! With all due respect, Aunt Susan, we don't need your help. There's nothing wrong with us. Look how rude you are! You don't know how to respect people! I respect those who respect me. I tried to respect you because you're older than me, and you're Gav's aunt. But I've had enough of your insults. I only care about Gavreel's welfare! Is there something wrong with that? Gav… If you don't want to be lectured, then fix yourselves! We're doing just fine. I'm not sure about you. How dare you answer back! You're so rude! What now, Gav? Are you just going to let your friend disrespect me? - He is not my friend! - Good for you! He is my boyfriend. What did you say? I said he is my boyfriend! What?! You don't know what you're talking about, Gav. You're the one who is clueless about me, about us! Grandma Cora raised me well, that's why I always respect you. I put up with your insults even though it hurts. But I won't let you do the same to my baby. Did you just call him baby? Yes, I did! He's my baby! You don't know what you're talking about, Gavreel. Aren't you afraid of God? Please don't use God's name to perpetuate your hate. You will regret this, that you refused to listen to me. Now answer me, what's really the point of your relationship? You're just playing house! You both know that your relationship is going nowhere because you cannot get married! But what about your husband, Uncle Rody? He slept with another woman, right? Your son Enzo knocked up a girl and abandoned her. Did you hear anything from me? Nothing! - I never said a word! - Gavreel! Don't you dare drag them into this. You don't know what my family went through! Why are you fighting for him? What's the point? You're going to leave soon to be with your Aunt Myra, right? You're leaving, baby? Why didn't you tell me? It's not for you to decide! You're so selfish. Your Aunt Myra is sick, Gavreel. Her husband left her alone. Can't you understand how miserable she is? Aunt Myra is sick? She doesn't want you to know. But I had to say it, after what happened tonight. Gavreel, she has stage 3 cancer. Think about what's important to you. Baby… Baby... Baby… Baby… Baby, Baby, here's your coffee. Good morning. What a beautiful day. That's really random. No, it's not. It's a beautiful day because I'm with you, and finally, Aunt Susan is gone! But mostly because I'm with you. Do you think that's a compliment? Well, I just know that this day will be great. So… So… This coffee tastes good. This coffee tastes good. Why are you copying me? Because you don't say what you really want to say. What do I want to say? Fine! I'll say it for both of us. We're mutually attracted to each other. And you want to find out the next step. OK, fine! That's all I have to say. How about you? What do you want to say? You know what, you're such a tease! ♪ Speak your heart out ♪ ♪ and what it truly desires ♪ ♪ Because if you won't, ♪ ♪ you might miss your chance on me ♪ Hi! Good morning! Hi! Oh! What do we have here? Speaking of beautiful… Oh, you're talking about me? Who else would it be? Don't mention it! Thank you, I appreciate your compliment, but I'll appreciate you more if you'll help me carry my stuff. - OK. - Sure. So, where are my babes? They're inside. Let's do this. Ouch! We have muscles, but we still lack creativity. I think we need help. Your balloons are so expensive. The seller should have inflated these already. They are eco-friendly, so that will do. Girl. Girl, SOS!!! What's up? Seems like you want to tell me something. I'm worried about Gav. Look at him, he looks so happy. How much more if he's sad?! You might have a heart attack. Girl, I'm serious. Oh, I'm sorry. OK, tell me what happened. Aunt Susan visited us. I get it! I don't like her too! She's bad news! Yes! But do you know that Gav is leaving for the States? Will he push through with it? Last I heard, he didn't want to. So it's been his plan all along? Yes, ever since his grandma died, his Aunt Myra has always wanted to fly him to New York. I heard about Aunt Myra but he never told me that he's leaving. That's because he doesn't want to. Aunt Myra has been convincing Gav because she feels responsible for him. She never got the chance to return here. But before the pandemic, Gav already prepared everything. He only needed a plane ticket and he was good to go. But the pandemic happened? No. You happened. But that's not the bad news. Aunt Susan told us that Aunt Myra is sick. Oh my god! That's not how he copes. He hides it's when he's stressed. Just like when his grandma died. That's why I'm worried! How about you? How do you feel about the whole situation? Hi! It's your girl, Pearl! Welcome to my VG live! As you can see, this is the mini stage for our fundraising event for the benefit of our online learners. Awesome, right?! So guys, open your purse. You'll be entertained, and you can help as well! Are you ready to hear me sing? No! Really? I already have bashers? You're giving me vertigo! Stop it! - Hello! - Hello! It's not your turn yet! Wait for me to call you! This isn't a talent show! We're just excited. It isn't obvious! Sorry, Pearl. Apology accepted! Wait, let's read the comments. Here, let's read this one: “Wow, CaiReel! Thanks, your highness!” You're welcome! Of course, it's my responsibility since I'm the president of CaiReel Nation... Cavite chapter! Don't worry, we all got negative swab test results, and we're just at home. Wait, someone is wondering why you're here. Because this is my house? Silly! I mean, invite our viewers to our event! Guys, watch out for our surprise for all of you! What surprise are you talking about, baby? It's a surprise! And what's all this commotion about? Oh my god, Chill! Wait, wait, wait, say hi! Hello! Our special guest has arrived! Actually, we still have a lot of surprises for you on Saturday, so watch out! Bye! What took you so long? We've been waiting for you! I waited for my swab test result! Good thing it was negative. Pearl told us that you'll help us improve our set? I think all of you need to take another swab test because you've lost your taste. Kidding! What you did was OK, we just need to redo everything. Just kidding! What do we need to do? I'll do whatever you want. In fairness to you, you're such a trouper. I just need to be busy. Oh, we still have other... Pearl, did you set me up? What set up are you talking about? What is Terrence doing here? You didn't know? I thought you're friends on Screentime? Didn't you see his posts? No, because I blocked him. What? I didn't know, I'm sorry. You never told me about it. I'm sorry, Pearl, but I have to go. What? Wait… OK, I understand. Baby, what's happening? I have no idea. Don't touch me! Stop it, guys! You might hurt each other! Can you just talk calmly... I got this! OK, fine. - Achilles, talk to me, please! - We don't have anything to talk about, Terrence. - Achilles! - Terrence, I get it, OK?! It's just that I am not emotionally prepared for this encounter. I just want to explain. And what? Make me feel pathetic again? Terrence! Gavreel! I'm talking to Terrence. Just let him be. Let me be?! Calm down, guys! What a way to invalidate my feelings, Terrence! Gavreel, she has stage 3 cancer. Think about what's important to you. - Aren't you afraid of God? - What's really the point of your relationship? You're going to leave soon to be with your Aunt Myra, right? - Oh my god, Gav! - Baby! Baby! - Gav! - Baby! Baby! Gav! What's wrong? - Hey, Gav! - Where are you going? Baby! Hold on, baby! Where are you going? Baby! I don't know! I'll join you! Baby, please just let me be. No, I won't! Baby… No! You can ignore me all you want, but I just want to be with you. OK? I won't let you go through your struggles alone. Baby, please? Baby… Girl, are you OK? I just need some space to breathe. OK. I'll just get something. Stay here. OK. OK. Achilles, can we talk? And what? You'll apologize again? That's the right thing to do. Why do I feel like you're only saying sorry just to feel good about yourself? That's unfair. I'm saying sorry because I want us to be OK. What if I don't want to make peace with you, would you still apologize? Yes, I will always apologize to you. Can you tell me why I'm mad at you? What do you think? I'm sorry, I stood you up. I know I was an asshole. "Anybody can fall for you." "Maybe the timing wasn't right for us." What? Those were your words, Terrence! You know, I was ready to move on. I was ready to become your friend again. But why did you have to say those words? I was stupid to believe what you said. But I meant it. You were just bored and had no one to talk to that's why you thought of flirting with me. I meant every word I said that night. Maybe if... If you had not met that other guy, you would have fallen for me? You know what, Terrence, I don't want to be your plan B, OK? Maybe I'd be happier for you in the future, but for now, I'll have to think about it. I'm sorry. OK. Are you OK, sis? - Yes, of course! - Are you sure? You want me to drive you home? No need, girl! We're professionals here. I won't be wasting my swab test nor my time for a guy. - Fierce! - You know me! Baby… Baby, look… Look at the view. Wake up, baby. Baby... - What's wrong, baby? - Take a look.

Come on, stop fooling around. Stop it! Thank you, baby. For what, baby? You insisted on coming here with me. Who taught me to be insistent? I get so sad at home because it's so quiet and I'm all alone. Now it's rowdy back there. That's why I ran away because I want to process what's happening. Don't think about it for now, baby. I'll accept whatever your decision is. OK? But we're partners, baby. I always have to consider what you feel. Your Aunt Myra needs you, baby. We don't even know if Aunt Susan was telling the truth. She just wants to take over our business. Aunt Myra never told me anything about her condition. Maybe you need to talk to Aunt Myra first. What do you think? It's best to hear it straight from her. Why do I feel like you want me to leave? I didn't mean it that way. I just want to let you know that I would understand if you really have to leave. I'm also leaving, right? I'm going back to our province. It's not the same, baby. We already have a plan, right? I'll visit you in your province every month. You'll just finish college and then you'll ask for your mom's permission so you can go back here, and we can be together, finally. How will that happen if I'm in New York... We can still make a new plan. Easy for you to say. What? Of course not, baby. I knew from the start that this is just temporary. In the morning when I wake up and see your face, it just makes me so happy. My favorite time of the day is when we eat together. I don't like sleeping next to someone. But I'll miss your loud snores, for sure. This isn't easy for me, baby, I don't want you to have a hard time... That was so sweet, baby. I am madly in love with you, baby. You sure are. How about you? Let's talk about our plans after I make a call to Aunt Myra. (GAVREEL & CAIRO NO MATTER WHAT) Nice parking, baby. Baby, I'll be outside. Just call me if you need me. This won't take long. I know. Hi, Gavreel! Hi, Aunt Myra. What's with the face? Aunt Myra... That's why I didn't want to let you know. Look at you. So handsome and yet, you can't even smile at me. Why didn't you tell me? Because I don't want you to worry about me. I don't want you to go here just because you feel sorry for me. I don't want to play the pity card. No way. I want you to decide on your own. I'm not aware because I always missed your calls. I know the reason why. But I'm not asking you to come here to take care of me. In fact, I want to take care of you while I still can. I owe your parents a lot, and I haven't been with you for a long time, so I want to make it up to you. You always take care of me. But I can still do more if you'll let me. I hope I'm not asking too much, sweetie pie. But please... Can you come and live with me here in New York? Rain or shine, nothing can stop us! So let's do this! Your donation of any amount can help a lot of students. Again, check the details below. Thank you! As the president of CaiReel Nation...

That's why you snuck out of your room! You guys are just envious! Right, baby? I admit, I've been stuck in dry season for so long. Seriously? That bad? That's crazy! You may leave now so we can continue. Jerk! Thank you, Cai. - Master! - Boss! Thank you. Thank you. Look, baby, he's so dramatic! Don't worry about it. Your highness. I love you, babes! I love you! Come on, guys! Wait! - Let's take a selfie! - Game! One… two… three! Smile! Baby, if you'll stop me from leaving, better do it now. Silly! We've already talked about this, right? You'll go straight to the international airport, while I'll take the domestic flight. Did you tell the driver to pass through the back gate? Yes, so you can take the front gate. OK. Don't look back, OK? Even if I'll just give you a flying kiss? Yes. You might not be able to keep yourself from running after me. I'm sure you'll do the same. Definitely. That's why we have to do this, baby. Can I hug you? Ouch. Baby! Ouch! - Ouch. Enough, baby! - I won't let you go! Wait, baby. Enough. No looking back. No more crying.
