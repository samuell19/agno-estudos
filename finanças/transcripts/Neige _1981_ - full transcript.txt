- There is this blue color, This color that makes everything change. Blue like the veins that Bobby fills with a white liquid. White and empty, ...like a gaze fixed on this kid I raised, and who keeps slipping through my fingers, his eyes turned to the distant islands. Loulou got his musician friends hired by Mr. Le Chat. Goodbye to the has-beens. The fairground people have settled down on the boulevard. It's party time. Here's your mug. Feeling better? That's 2 half-pints, right? - Now you want a Coke? - Yeah. Here's the Blondie, Let's start the parade! Here's the second one. Here's Maggie! Here's the brunette! Take a look! The show is going on. For those interested, Nadège and Murielle are waiting for you inside. Gentlemen, take your tickets! The show is going on. Come on! Nadège and Murielle will offer you the full strip-tease. Keep moving! Keep moving, you're going to have fun! For those who are interested, come on! Let's go in merrily, of course! We're about to start! Arlette, I'm going to the back. Bobby! Why the fuck are you here? The cops are surrounding the area. Cops surrounding the area... - They will find you eventually. - No, God is protecting me. Bobby, watch out. - Go back to your café, I'm working now. - You're silly. So? He didn't listen to me. He says God is on his side. You see where your words are leading? Anita, you don't think God is on the cops' side too, huh? Damn, what the fuck has God got to do with it? - 600 francs. - Shit! Now you're eating frog legs? - I have expenses, pastor. - Ah yeah, good one! That guy has expenses. Bloody Hungarian! Here's 300 francs. But, I want to see you sing tomorrow at the church service, with your deep, sweet voice. - I can't sing. - Well, you all sing out of tune... It will be good for you. You'll see some gals. We'll make miracles. -Miracles? What's that? Listen, in order for the sisters to make evil go away, you need a miracle! - Well, I'm gonna spar. I'll meet you there. Are you coming too, Joko? He's in your heart, huh? There's nothing in my heart but the fear of dying old, pastor. You know, it can be resolved easily. I know. I've got the equipment just in case. Come on. He's not giving up. That's because of love. Shut up! Jesus freaks! Come on, show that you've got some guts! That's it, yes! Stand up straight! Come on! Yeah! (swearing in his language) - It's just not your day, come. - Pic, pic, pic! Tac, tac! - Come on! Come on! - You're wrong to come in here, Joko. We're gonna dance. In La Main Bleue Are you coming? No, I'm busy tonight. Hey! Are you sleeping at home? Where am I supposed to go? Let me kiss you. - So? Did you like it? That was good, huh? You should come more often. You made a mistake 3 years ago, but it's over. You'll come back more often. You're gonna be great again. A little bit, huh? What do you think? Yeah. Yeah? - OK. - You like it? Yeah, you liked it? - You're not too tired? - No it's ok. The phone's ringing. - Drink, it feels good. - No, I don't drink. - You're not alone. - Bye, baby. - So, Pastor, everything's good? - Yeah, everything's gonna be alright. You wouldn't happen to be going to Montreuil, would you? I'm off duty, pastor. I'll make an effort for a man of God. That's nice of you. Do you know La Main Bleue? - The blacks' warehouse? - Yeah. He doesn't realize, he's just a kid. No he's not a kid anymore, Anita. I'm scared for him. There was a cop raid. Bobby had just left me. You only think about him. I did not take care of him for 10 years just so that he could do this! She's nuts... Deal with your own shit. I'm exhausted, Pierrot. By the way, have you bought coffee? Yes. Well... Things don't seem to get any better for you. No. With Bobby, I always feel like it's all my fault. - All your fault, all your fault... Why not mine while we're at it? Come with me. Let's have a smoke. You think he's gonna make the show? I don't know about him but you will, if you go on like that. Very funny. - I'm leaving now, Loulou. - Yeah. - They don't have any money. - Shut the fuck up. I'm tired of standing up. My legs are hurting. I'm getting bored outside. Yeah, so get back outside immediately. Fuck, Robert! Charlotte. What do you want? Shit, I'm on my way. Keep an eye on here instead of looking them. I have some work to do but I'm waiting the little rascal. You don't have to. All right, all right. The blond guy, he's over there. Oh... He seems to be hyper. He's one of Bobby's biggest clients. Well, he's really nervous. - He's on his way. Look! Hi, you OK? - What? - Have you seen Bobby? No. You OK? Have you seen Bobby? Stay calm, don't get me noticed. I'm calm. You OK? I'm crashing. Do you still play music? - You OK today? - Bobby! - What? - Don't forget me. No, get in line. - How much do you want? - Two. - Now, get out. - Bye. We're gonna grab a bite to eat and then we'll go to your place. - OK? - Yes. I'm going out now. (speaking Arabic) OK. Wanda Vallès, the visit is over. Are you coming back Tuesday? I'll try. Yes, I'll come back. I love you. Bruno Vallès? - What do you want? - Narcotics. - Oh, shit... No, we would just want to talk. - We don't blame your wife. She cleared the way. She did this for moral reasons. He had killed her sister. Let's not exaggerate. Bertino didn't kill anyone. - Overdose, it's the same thing. - Yeah, it's a way of looking at it. - Your kid, is she OK? Thanks. The newspaper, please. Wanda will get parole if you say what you know. - What I know about what? - Vallès, don't act like this. - About what? We're talking about the fix. - Never heard of anything like that. - Vallès! The junkies walk on eggshells and sing hymns. It's good shit, huh? - So what am I supposed to do? - Well... The string, Vallès, the string. You know? Like in the myth. Marianne's [sic] thread, you know. Yes. He knows this one, but what we want... ...is to get into the Labyrinth, not out of it. - You understand? - You're two bitches. - Yeah, yeah. So, think about all of it. Take your time. But not too much. We're a bit nervous. Here's our number. Ask for Rousseau. Think about your daughter. She must wonder about a lot of things. I think about her. Here, for her. - A sandwich with chorizo please. - A sandwich with chorizo. - Here it is. - Thanks. I have something for Linda. - Here Linda, an apple if you want. - Anita is searching for you. - I'll be back before midnight. - Bye. Look at this. - Look. - It's nice. Here he is. Ah yeah. - Will you ask him? - No, I don't dare. - OK, I'll see him. Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Pastor? - I have something to ask. - Go on, I'm listening. I want to know if you can heal ill people without seeing them. Without seeing them? Depends on the disease. if it's serious and they are... In an hospital? Well, It's beyond my knowledge. What a shame. I see it doesn't spoil your appetite. Give me a cigarette. As soon as I said hello, he showed up and kicked me in the face. - What did you do? - Nothing, I couldn't do anything. He said: "Sorry, I didn't mean to." OK, OK, I'll let you talk with him. Loulou, get him a beer, he doesn't have any. - And a pastis for me. - OK. It's about time. I feel like I'm falling apart. Sure, we're going to fall apart bit by bit, every day. You want a bite? - You OK? - Yeah. - I'll give the lesson tonight. - That's great. Do you know you love me? You know, every night at the same time, I feel like the world is becoming phosphorescent. You don't answer to my question? - One beer. - And my pastis? Hey, your musicians are good. Yeah. Better than Yvette Horner. - You understand now? - What? You understand now. Thank you, Loulou. Oh, enough. So Anita, you don't have any troubles with the Devil? Don't you need to pray? It's cheap. Listen, Pastor. Hell is inside me. - She's a lost cause. - Nooo... I can handle that, but if you stay with the Hungarian, I can't. I don't stay with anybody, don't forget. OK, it was just a figure of speech. Turn your fucking tongue in your mouth before speaking. Hey, she's nervous. I'm sick and tired of all this shit. I want to go home. Hey, I bet they're on Exodus, 20 francs on Exodus? All right. And as much for you. Come on, look at the black one. Where is the black one? So, how much did you make today? That's not something to ask to an honest man. All right, he talks like a real priest. - Find the black one. - Be careful. You're trying to insult a churchman, aren't you? Don't forget you're not allowed to insult a man of God. That's the game. Listen to her. So can you do this for me until next week? Next week? - Is it OK for a special? - What kind of special, sweetie? You wanna fuck her or you wanna pull her a tooth? Why do you mind? I can pay. - I don't do dentists - You... Yeah, "You whore", I know. Here he is! Where? The colored one. Oh, Bobby! (speaking African language) Yeah, OK, You join me inside? You waiting for me? Cops! Stop! Police, stop! Police! Drop the weapon! Hey! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hey, Blondie! No need to go there! - What? - They shot Bobby. What? Bobby's dead? Are you crazy? Heh, it's not my fault. A narc shot him 2 times in the head. -Bobby... What about the drugs? - Don't bother me! I can't help you with that! Get out! Fuckers! Miss, I want to see Bobby. Right? Come, Bernard. We're gonna see Bobby? - What's going on? - I want to see Bobby. - There's no Bobby here! - But I wanna see Bobby. - He's dead! - Dead? - He's dead, get the fuck out! I said get the fuck out! - Get out! - Come on, get out, get out! Hurry up! Come. No, Twist, today I can't take you. Why not? You didn't see I'm not taking anybody today? Understood. You're gonna see your princess in her palace. Yeah. I hope she hasn't lost too much weight. - Give her a kiss for me. - OK. - Well, I'm gonna walk the dog. - Ciao. Ciao. - He's probably sleeping. - He's here, Loulou. - All right, I'm coming. Where do you come from? Come on, get to work. If there's anyone who can't blame Loulou, it's you. Come on, don't push it. That would be good if we could grab some money, we're running out. Money? How dare you? Nothing before Saturday. - But we need it now... - A promise made is a promise kept. I keep my promises too. Yeah, yeah! You promised me heaven, like Bobino! Your loser music is driving away my clientele. It's your clientele that is a bunch of losers. So I guess yours is better... A lemonade every two hours. Don't get angry. Even Loulou doesn't give a shit anymore. - It has nothing to do with me. - I'm tired of it, get the fuck out! I don't want to hear you. Here for you. - You're here to drink or to hit on me? - I need to talk to you now. Have you heard the news? It depends, what news? Come. Hi Loulou, you OK? - Loulou, a half pint. - OK, let's go. What's the news? Your baby. The dealer. Bobby? - Bobby? - He's dead. Last night. He's been shot by the narcs. It was like a safari. No... They all pass away at some point. Not everybody. If I did the right things... What right things? Nothing. Nothing! I was late again. You knew about the cops? Kind of. I could have warned him. He wouldn't have listened. Goddamnit. Too obvious. Who could have turned him in? Probably a good friend of him Seriously, where have you been? When they bust you, you have to give a name or they put you in jail! I'll kill him. I'll kill him. Anita, you're not his mother. That's easy to say. Get out... Get the fuck out! Cut your crap. Listen, I'll see you tonight. Later? I won't see anyone tonight. I'm mourning. I couldn't come last Tuesday. I was waiting for some moron at the airport. I figured it out. It was the end of the holidays. Heard it on the radio. Vesperini. in the visiting room. How are you, Wanda? I can't stop thinking about that moment. The more I think about it, the more I believe... ...there was nothing else to do. You don't have to go through all this again. I know, Bruno, but... You weren't there to see him... with his dead eyes and his bloody... ...needle. No. Munchen, the lawyer. It's always the same old serenade. The cops don't do anything. They scoop the bodies up. They destroy evil with evil. Well... You know, the kid. Yes? Well, nothing. If... they give me the parole... do you think... Well... I often think of you, you know. We think of you, too. You can talk about anything with me. - Do you know the story of the crocolion? - What's that? - The fiercest animal from Africa. - Why? He has a crocodile head, and a lion one on his back. How does he poop? He can't, that's why he's so fierce. What's going on? Forget it. Are you all right? Betty! Don't you recognize me? It's Anita! - The barmaid. - 1 gram. I want my fix. I don't have any. How can I help you differently? I'm gonna die. I need you to hold me. - I'm sick of everything, I wanna die! - I will find a solution. There's no solution. My fix! Listen, come with me, we're gonna try to walk a bit. We'll see for the fix later. Where are you going? In Hell. In Hell with all the weirdos. Come with me, we're going to the cabaret. Come on! Come on. Do something please, I won't be able to go on stage. I don't know any dealer. Bobby provided me what I needed. But now he's dead, that son of a bitch. Don't say that. Don't talk about Bobby. And speed? Could you give me some? Maybe, I'll try. Go, sweetie. Make it quick. OK. - Denis... - Ciao! Can you... - What's going on? - ...do me a favor? Yeah. I need you to help me out with something. - Need money? - No, it's for a friend. You know, your stuff... Speed, do you have some? I need 2 packs. It's vital. But I... Well... Come, come... - Here... - I'll pay you. (speaking Italian) I'd like to continue to exist one more night Oh sweet mirror on the wall... who is the fairest one of all? Not you, but Snow White. Yeah, snow. It's white. White. Are you playing a squaw? No, I don't like them. They stay in their teepees only to cook. So, who are you? Ah! I am... A great chief. Geronimo. No. Brave Eagle. It's me, Brave Eagle. We're a pair. Tell me... How is it, the first time? The first injection? Yeah. Hard to tell. The impression that we lived only for that moment. And after that? After? You want it to last. to last forever. - You never wanted to stop doing it? - No. Never. If you stop doing it, you die. But not immediately. Slowly, it's a slow torture. Do you think it'll last long? your show and your fix? the whole shit? I like red roses. Here, they come to see me at the intermission. But not to give me flowers. So Betty, what are you doing? We're almost done, you're going to be late. You know, when I was a kid, my parents wanted me to work in a grocery store. your stuff reminds me of... the weighing scale they gave me to play the shopkeeper. You could have ended up as a florist. You would have brought me some flowers. Yeah. Tell me, Anita, You don't know anyone who could sell a fix? Heroin is not my cup of tea. I'm sure you heard about it. Yeah, a little bit. I knew Bobby very well. You have to do something... Or else, I won't be able to go on. OK. I'll see what I can do. I'll do my best. And there I am, Betty Patchwork! A brand new, synthetic thing. 5000 km on the meter. A great bargain. And when I say "thing", I choose my words carefully. I can't imagine she would do that. Vallès thinks she's involved. Yeah, but she probably works as amateur, for extra cash. There are no amateurs. She wouldn't stay behind the counter... if she's a seller. It's a good cover. Yeah, you're right, let's go. Let's try. Hello, little thing. My friend, Pierrot. Hey! The wind is blowing in the good direction for you. ...on the roof tiles. You chickened out, did you? You let him go. Yeah. That pig, his ass was wet. Isn't dog meat tasty? Filthy shit... Disgusting shit that stinks like death Makes me sick. You piss me off. Who do you think you are? An Asian jewel. I'll give you a smile from the East... The sun is shining. How do I look? You look like a fairy. A fairy? Tales for kids. And on my forehead? It's beautiful, Annie - It's shining. - Yes, a lot. It's my lucky star. Ah, I warn you. - Daddy? - Yes? Does she think of me? Of course. You know she sends you letters. Yes, but... Daddy? Will she come back? Of course. It's weird, in these letters she doesn't say anything about the hospital. She doesn't say anything about it because she doesn't want to upset you. Yes, maybe. Bruno, Bruno, listen. In the high school... What? They say mommy is a whore. Hey! Ah I'm lucky, could you lend me 100 francs? Here, for you. - What am I gonna do with that? - Bags. - I hope you came to see your father. - Yeah. Pierrot, a surprise for you! Hello, son Look who's there. What are these guys doing here? He asked me if he came back last night. The lovely lizard ran away once again. By the way, could you lend me 100 francs? Don't laugh. Not surprising from you. Pierrot, whenever you want. You OK? Hey, do you know Betty in the Sexy Pigalle's? - A cross-dresser, right? - Yes, the short-haired one. - She bought from Bobby. - Did she? - Yes, they all take drugs. - So what? I picked her up on the street, she was in really bad shape. I have speed but... I think she won't last long. Yeah it's serious, without the fix, I don't know what could happen to her. - Yeah. - There are therapies. Calm down, Anita. Calm down. Willy, try to understand, She could be in very bad shape. She won't be able to go outside and work I understood, OK, but you shouldn't be concerned about it. Yes, I'm concerned. She asked me to find some, so I will. I'm thinking. Tonight, we will find the supplier. The big one. You're not a social worker. It's too complicated for you. Listen, sweetie, I can do something for you. Yeah, you can pray for her, it could cost her life. Cut the crap! We won't die for that. It's not a business for amateurs. Powder is easy to find, but you have to belong to the network. She'll find another dealer when she feels better. You two are funny, you look like two nice rescue dogs in a movie. You piss me off! Do I? You spoke to me differently some time ago. What do you mean? Do I owe you something? - Come on, tell me! - I didn't say anything. - You're looking down? - No. Come on, Anita. Willy, you know what I'm seeing in your eyes? A great, clean, healthy, ordinary happiness. 3 rooms with kitchen, fully equipped. A sandbox for the children, a TV humming its usual bullshit. A nice and young wife. A tidy marriage, with the Saturday night fun! No hassle, you don't owe anything to anyone. That's what I see in your eyes, it isn't exciting at all. Now it's all about the emergency. It's all about Betty. So Joko, take care of her, and ciao bye-bye! Get the fuck out! And myself! And ourselves! (preaching in creole) Lord! Lord, I don't want to go there anymore! The satiated souls fed with brown sugar, brown like my skin! Black people... have worked too hard. Why learn from books that talk about things we can't see? We don't give a shit about the Capetian dynasty! Michaud stayed up at night in his cottage, ...near the hamlet, while watching over his herd. The sky was shining brightly. He began to sing: "I see the Morning Star" He began to sing: "I see the Morning Star" "I see the Morning Star" "I see the Morning Star" "I see the Morning Star" Joko? We have to pray for my mother, she's not healed. (speaking creole) - 8 for Saturday. - OK, only 8? (speaking creole) By the way, they wrote a poem for Bobby. For Bobby? Please read. (reciting the poem in creole) Joko! Troubles these days? Go to the kiosque across the street. - Hello Sylvie. - Hello. How are you? Did the Apple Queen came? He's in the Anvers Park. Thank you. Hey, Blondie! Come! What do you want? Do you have some? You kidding? There's nothing left. - I'm fucked. - What will you do now? We have to wait. That's shitty, huh? They know what to do... They wait for us to be wound up, then they sell at high price... I know, but the deal? What about it? There's nobody for it. - No one to take over the job? - No. Maybe the blind guy will tell you something about that. The one in the hall of the cinema? Yeah, that's the only one. OK. - Hey, if you have something... - Oooh... - Who are you? - Joko. I have a friend who's in withdrawal. She could die. She really needs it. You'll have to wait. And when it comes back, we'll go to the heavens, Yeah, yeah... My friend really can't wait. You know the big seller. No one knew him but Bobby. I'm sure we can meet him. There's someone who can help you. He's a pimp from Barbès. Ask Menendez. Menendez? I never asked you for anything. How much do you want? You have to give it back to me in 15 days. Thank you. You know Le Chat always grabs my tips. Yeah, always the same story. Ciao. You come back... Not too soon? Hi. Is Menendez here? Ask the girls. Thanks. - You want to go upstairs? - I don't have time. I must see Menendez. He's very busy. - Do you know where he is? - No one knows where he is. Go to the Domino, to the Goutte d'Or. - Domino? - Yeah. - OK, thank you ladies. - I'll pay. Nice! I started to borrow some money. Even Eddy gave me some. I have a small amount, and you? I stole some in the temple. You're a man of God, it's OK to manage His money. Excuse me... Menendez? Joko of the Holy Trinity Temple He's waiting for you. How's that? Words travel fast here in Barbès. And where? Let's go! Ah it's a 2. You're not lucky today Joko! 2, it's 15 francs. (speaking Arabic) - Hey, brother, 10 francs! - No, no. Look at that quality! Touch it! (speaking Arabic) Yes, yes, but I'd like to touch the lord's robe. The lord's robe? Why didn't you said it earlier? A client for you, Father. I leave you. Priest? It's me, Menendez. What do you want? I'm trying to save someone. Like a real rescue dog. It's for a cross-dresser who takes... 1 gram a day. - That's a lot. - Yes. Tell me, do you think you can do something for her? Are you alone? Yes... well no, I'm with a friend. - You ask for coffee? - That's right. OK. Let's go. - Hi Ahmed - Hi, uncle. This guy needs some packets. How much? How much Priest? 3 grams. - Amateur? - Worse, the social worker kind. Come back later, 5:00 PM Thank you. How are you, kid? - Anita, I've got a date. - I'm coming with you.

You could talk about it with the Hungarian, huh? I don't want to hear any more about him. We'll manage. Are you sure? We're stuck, sir. I tell you it's not for me. You don't believe me. Ok, fine. Do you remember Franco? Now he works in ad business. Do you want his address? Thank you, Mr. Borelli. Oh, don't forget about Friday. All right. Hey Franco, your secretary doesn't come from the area, right? I hope you're here as a friend. Of course, I've always kept my word. Yeah, that's true. What can I do for you? A packet, in memory of the good old days. - So you've got into this? - No! It's for helping out someone. All right. Hello. - Is Betty here? - No. What time does she work?
