Hi, I'm Keith Lemon. Welcome to Christmas... Shopping! 'In this festive special, 'I'll be helping celebrities 'fill their trolleys with seasonal treats.' Oh, it's not real. 'Whilst also getting to know them on a more personal, 'Christmassy level.' Have you ever kissed a dog too romantically? 'I'll take Michelle Visage to a day trip to Bath 'to buy stocking fillers.' What are you gonna do? Are you gonna fight me? Cos I can take it, Lemon. I'll kiss your mouth. LAUGHTER 'I help Johnny Vegas do his big yuletide food shop.' LAUGHTER No! No! 'Pick out a right nice Christmas tree 'with pop star Ella Eyre...' Do you ever forget any words when you're performing live? All the time. Do you? The intro will be happening and I'll be like, "All right, I hope you guys know this one." In my head I'm going, "Cos I fucking don't." LAUGHTER '..and me and my old mate Willoughboozy 'shop for a sparkly festive frock.' If I didn't know you in real-life, I'd have blown my beans in my pants. What a lovely thought. 'All in the name of sweet baby Jesus's birthday.' BELCHES: Jesus, happy birthday. MUSIC: 'One More Sleep' by Leona Lewis # Snow was falling all around us # My baby's coming home For Christmas... # GRUNTS Jedi powers. Hi, I'm on a train going to Bath. I'm meeting Michelle visage. She's over there, I can see her. She's over there. Michelle! Hey! How's it going? Oh, wonderful. You smell good. Yeah, well, they've got nice soap in there. Oh, perfect. I've just had a shit. I hope you didn't wash hands. No, I did, I did, yeah. A bit went under my fingernail. LAUGHTER It didn't, it didn't. There we are, look. Oh, in't it Christmassy? So, we're going to Bath. Yes. And we're going to buy...? Christmas stuff. Christmas stuff? Yeah. Stocking stuffers... Stocking stuffers? Yeah, is that what you call it? It's fillers. Stuffers. That's an Americanism, then, I guess. NEW YORK ACCENT: I gotta get my stocking fillers. Stocking stuffers. NEW YORK ACCENT: And a coffee for my dog. There we are again, nearly there. You're a big advocate for the... erm... G... What are the letters? L... L-G-B-T-Q plus. Q-I-A plus. Close! What is it, now? L-G-B-T-Q-I-A plus. What are all those letters? Right, lesbian. Gay. Bisexual. Lesbians are my favourite thing. Of course they are. Especially, Christmas lesbians. What's a Christmas lesbian? There's always a tree in the background. It sparkles beautifully. LAUGHTER And that's what I like. What were we saying? Lesbians. Gays. Gay. Bisexual. Bisexual. Transgender. Transgender. Queer. What's queer? Cos queer is a bad word from the '80s. You're right. So thank you for asking that. There's a reclaiming of the word queer, to mean an umbrella. I have a daughter who's queer, and she identifies as queer and not a lesbian. Because queer can be a bunch of things under that umbrella. Now, there are some people who don't like that word... Yeah. ..but it's part, now, of the moniker, because there are people who identify as queer. So, let's go back to the letters. Intersex. Into sex? Intersex. People are all into sex. No, intersex is somebody who is born with both genitalia. I thought that's, erm... It used to be called hermaphrodite. Yes. We don't say that any more. Oh, is that a bad word now? Correct. That's a bad word, Mum. Yeah. And A, is a few things, but mainly in the community, it's asexual. Yeah. Or ace. Plus, is everybody else. So, plus is everybody else who feels like they belong in the community, but doesn't want any one of those labels to label them. What am I? You're... You would be in the plus. Well, I'm glad that I'm a plus. That I'm not part of anything, but now I'm part of something. I feel like I want to dip into belonging when I feel I want to belong, and sometimes, I don't want to belong. I like not belonging sometimes. You definitely march to the beat of your own drummer. 'Here we are, pulling into Bath. 'When we got off the train, the weather was shit, 'so here's some nice footage of Bath looking lovely. 'Not that kind of Bath. 'That's better. Look, they're all in a rush. 'It must be Black Friday.' Christmas crackers. We don't have those in America. Should I get a sack for my kids? Yeah. I had a pillowcase when I was a kid. Right. With what? Is that the end of your story? Yeah. LAUGHTER I'm glad you had a pillowcase. What did you do with it? What were you like as a kid at Christmas? Greedy. Greedy? Yeah. I didn't have a lot growing up. What was your dreams? What did you want? Big things. Yeah? I wanted cars, I wanted fur coats, I wanted things like that. I went through a phase of stealing Barbie doll clothing. Did you? Putting it down my panties. What, so you had a big bulge? All the time. I'd leave the shop like... A full wardrobe of Barbie clothes? Back then, being... I was an adopted kid... Right. ..I was adopted into a family who didn't have a lot, but we had enough to get by. Michelle is best known for being a judge on the hugely successful RuPaul's Drag Race, but has since got some new fans from being on Strictly Come Dancing. I've got a whole new audience that I didn't really have before, which is women of my age and over. Which is lovely... Yeah. ..because we're kind of all in this together, and women don't support women any more... Yeah. ..so it's a good thing to see it. To see women going, "You can do this, this is awesome." 'Michelle's been married for 23 years, 'after getting engaged in just three weeks. Wow. 'As we were talking, 'Michelle mentioned what she was like in her younger years.' I was a bit of a slaggy kid. You were a slag? I was. Were you? Yeah. You dirty slag. Yeah, I was. Proudly, though. But I was in control of it. Yes. Like, it was something I knew... You were the master slag? 100%. Yeah. Wasn't being taken advantage of, enjoyed it. I was kind of like the dude in the situation. I'd be like, "Thanks." Yeah, were you? Yeah. Did you use, like, dudes, and just drop them like that? Absolutely. Like a mic? Yeah. Holy shitballs. Boom. 'Before she had time to drop me, 'I thought I'd take her for a nice, festive drinky-poo. 'You know, stuff with twigs and berries in.' Nice to enjoy a little mulled wine at Christmas time. Yes. But whilst we do so, why don't we have a little quick-fire question? It's my favourite thing. If you could change one thing about you, what would it be? My tits, but I got them out already. You had massive jugs. Huge. What happened? They were trying to kill me, they were making me sick. Did they own your mind? All the time. All the time. They took over. I bet they owned other people's minds. "Look at me, look at me." "Oh, I'll try not to. Ugh!" So I yanked them out. What is your favourite meat? I don't eat meat. What is your favourite thing to stick in your mouth? SHE LAUGHS I'm going to go with sugar. Can you swim? I was a competitive swimmer, state champ, until I was 13 years old. What's your favourite swearword? BLEEP What is the best thing we can do to save our planet? If we're not that bothered? Recycle. Have you ever fingered your bum? Never. Look at my nails. Oh, you would cut it. Thank you. Do you believe in ghosts? Yeah, I believe in ghosts. My grandmother had died... Don't tell me you saw your grandmother. I saw my grandmother at the end of my bed... Did she have feet? I saw her sitting. Was she see-through, like a hologram? She was see-through. What was her audio like? Was it clear? No, no audio. Oh, just visual? Just sitting there. And were you scared? Shit my bed. And finally, what's your favourite dinosaur? It's a nice one. Triceratops. Wicked. Yours? Dippilydorcus. It's not dippilydorcus. It's dippilydorcus. Diplodocus. That's why I like it, cos of its name. "Hello, it's Mr Dippilydorcus." LAUGHTER 'Right, time to get some stocking fillers. 'I mean, stocking stuffers (!)' What have we got so far? Well, so far... SHE LAUGHS You've got a pocket heat pad. A hand-held sewing machine. A balloon animal. Yeah. LAUGHTER IMITATES A CHILD: Ah, buh, suh, huh, guh. Do you remember tiny baskets? Yeah. LAUGHTER "I've just come in for summat small." Do you remember Blue? No. They were a good band. Tell me why you need... A sharp carrot? Yes. Why would one need...? To do organic drawing with. SHE LAUGHS What are you scared of? Are you scared of anything? Yes, but I'll never say it. I'm scared of snakes. Are you really scared of snakes? Yeah. Would you ever go in the jungle? Absolutely not. I tell you what's scarier. What? Have you seen The Snowman? Where the little kid makes a snowman and it comes alive, and then he flies in the air. # We're walking in the air. # If there's a song, how's it scary? Imagine if it came in your house and just laid on top of you... It would melt. ..looking at you. It would crush you. And then it'd put its mitten-like hand inside your mouth, and its hand went bigger in your mouth. You're changing the story. HE GROANS "Mum, I've built a snowman an' it's come alive." You're changing the story. You know when I've had a few drinks? What happens? That's me. LAUGHTER But when I haven't, that's me. When I was a kid, I was scared of Santa. Cos Santa's scary. This guy that breaks into your house, comes in... Yeah. ..eats your food. What if he licks your face? What if he licks your face and shoves his mitten in your mouth? Oh, my god, yeah. Exactly. Choking on Santa's mitten. Imagine. That sounds like an analogy or a metaphor for something else. LAUGHTER AMERICAN ACCENT: Hi, Michelle. Hi. So, I'm thinking of having breast implants. What's your thoughts on that? Don't do it, they'll kill you. Won't it make me feel more womanly? Are you a woman?! Will it give me more confidence? It might give you something, not confidence. Hold on, I'm trying to figure out your accent. I don't know. LAUGHTER Where are you from? I know you're Latino. SPANISH ACCENT: Yeah, my name is Pedro. Wow. Yeah, I want to have breast implants. What do you think? What about chocolate coins? I like a chocolate coin. You like them. Do you? Hi. Do you need a bag today? Please. Can we take a rainbow one? Yeah, of course. There used to be a shop called C&A. What did they do? Wear clothes and stuff. But their logo used to be a rainbow. And then we took it over. You keep saying, "We." I'm part of the community. How do you become part of the community? I'm an ally. So I could just become part of it, then? Yeah, if you want to be an advocate or an ally. March. Speak up. I'd have to march? Can you do that? It depends if it's raining. You have to be willing to march in any weather. Ooh, I'll have to think about it, then. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Oh, my God, so American. Happy holidays! Has it stopped? I don't know. Right, I'm gonna march like a motherfucker. Oh, you're gonna go march now. # Oh, Christmas lights # Light up the street... # 'Before it were time to go home, 'Michelle wanted to pick up some glasses. 'She's already got 700 pairs. 'Apparently, though, that's not enough.' I am from the future. Your future is rubbish. AS TOM: Hello, my name is Tom Cruise. I've come to fly the plane. Oh, that's interesting. Better. Can't see 'em. I look like Richard Attenborough. LAUGHS Welcome to Jurassic Park. These are the ones, but I'm gonna get a Stanley knife and scratch that bit off there where t'logo is. 'Michelle spent a lot of her career speaking up for people 'and being an inspirational figure. 'I wonder what motivated her.' I got bullied, like, beat up. But what I realised through that was my friends who I thought were my friends were not there for me. So I learned later on in life that I didn't want that to happen to anybody else. What did you do, then? Where did the bravery come from? There was a gay boy in high school, 17 years old, 18 years old. And the cool boys were picking on him. So I just stood up and got in his face. Got in his face like this. And that's what happened. See how you backed off? But what if they didn't? He backed off, too. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna fight me? No. Cos I can take it, Lemon. I'll kiss your mouth. LAUGHTER What if that bully had just fell in love with you? And he went, "I didn't see your eyes so closely." # You're never gonna get it # Never ever gonna get it, nope. # Yeah, it's good. When you have a big mouth and you are able to help people, or you have a platform, whether your mouth is big or not, use it. Michelle, what a pleasure it's been shopping with you today. Yeah, I feel highly enlightened. Good. Thank you for having me. Thanks very much. It's good. And thank you for coming to Bath on this beautiful day. It's a shame about the weather. It's all right. But anyone walking with you is gonna feel a bit wet, aren't they? You're a lovely lady. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Shall we get on the train together, or separate trains? Separate trains, please. Who's gonna go first? Me. Thank you. Bye. She likes me really. I can tell. Yeah. I'll go now. I'll be comparing boobs with Ella Eyre. You've got a black tit and I've got a pink tit. They are fucking naughty, them, aren't they? Talking festive celebrations with Johnny Vegas. This old woman came up and she went, "Spending Christmas on your own?" And having a quiet drink with Holly Willoughboozy. Hang on a minute. This is my 12 days of Christmas. Look how excited she is just by booze. That's nice, coming down to me. Merry Keithmas. I'm outside Marks & Spencer's. The sun is in my eye. I'm doing a big shop today with Johnny Vegas. He's here. He looks like a fisherman. Johnny, you look like a fisherman! I look like Last Christmas. You look lovely. Shall we get inside? Yeah. I'll get a trolley. I've got one of them keyrings. Oi! I've got that. Oh, he's got one of those. He's got one of those, a pretend coin. # It's been a real hard year # There just ain't no way Getting around this # Life is hard... # Johnny, I'm enjoying that you've already purchased a coat. You look like you could be the new Doctor Who. The lovely thing with M&S is they don't have store detectives in the traditional sense. They follow you, but they don't hassle you. You look good. I look like a trawlerman who has recently lost his wife. Aha, the canapes or the can-apes. Could you honestly see me coming in from midnight mass half-cut, and going, "I'd better get my crispy breaded tiger prawns ready?" Are you a religious person? I was raised religiously. I was gonna be a priest. And then I had some dirty thoughts over the dinner lady. Did you? Ooh. These chocolates. Yes, I'm sort of religious, but I have my own dialogue with God. Will you go to a midnight mass thing? Yeah. You know what they do now? They do a teatime mass on Saturday, so you don't have to stay up late. Do they really? Yeah, it's like a... # Have a holly, jolly Christmas # It's the best time Of the year... # I'm interested in Johnny Vegas, does he do guacamole? If I put guacamole out on Christmas Day, I'd get hung. Oh, my God. Do you do hummus? Oh, yeah, chickpeas, everyone. What's more festive? No! No! What about olives? KEITH LAUGHS After scaring some of the weekly shoppers, I thought I'd take Johnny upstairs, to calm down over a Christmassy bite to eat. That looks lovely. Thank you. Wow, wicked. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas indeed. Obviously, it's not Christmas morning. Don't you think it's bad karma having a Christmas meal before Christmas? No, I think afterwards. Cos it's like you take your tree down, don't you, 12 days after. There's a woman who puts up a Christmas tree and puts up 15 different versions of Monkey on it. Do you get people shouting the Monkey thing at you? Still. 'Hello, Monkey.' Whether I like it or not, that was the thing that launched us as a household face. Do you like being famous? I like it less and less... as I get old. I don't like the nature of fame. I don't like the intrusive bit of it. I think, when you have a family, it's hard going out. You have chopped some timber? I have, yeah. What was the reason for that, then? Gout. Did you have gout? Gout is a great motivator. Did you have gout? Oh, gout. Imagine 1,000 years of dead relatives crawling up your leg. Sort of... The other day, I had a pasty and I nearly cried, cos I've not had one in such a long time. You mean you cried with joy? Yeah. It was just that... Did you kiss it? Well, I'm having extensive dental work. Have you got new teeth? Yes. Give us your biggest smile. I'm not going... He asked me what I wanted. I went, "I don't want a John Bishop. I just want... "a gentle reintroduction into society." Is that for acting roles? Is it heck! So you look more handsome? Do you honestly think they're gonna go... Don't. I had to go on self-tape the other week and do an American accent. On my own, in the house, pretending to talk to three people. Show us. No. Do your American accent. No. Honestly. Is it a comedy accent? It's like... Are you one of those? When your brother moved here, I went for the New York cab driver. I've never been coached. The minute you press send, you thought somebody is going, "Come and have a listen." The entire office. You know you haven't got the job, but they are all going in. I can't wait to see... It was to work with someone I've always wanted to work with, and you go, "Oh, God." # The season is upon us, It is that time of year... # 'After proper stuffing ourselves with turkey...' Sorry, everyone, as you were. '..it was time to continue with Johnny's big Christmas shop.' Curly things, do you like them? Yes, I do. But you know what they are good for? Watching a film to and just screwing them through your teeth dead slow. And pretending you're a cabinet. Have you ever used hairspray? When I had my demi wave. You used to have a perm. Let's have a picture of Johnny when he had his demi wave. You look lovely. I learned to scrunch. Yeah. I learned to not towel-dry. I learned to wrap a towel round and just let it naturally... How old were you then? About 19. Were you? Yeah. Shitballs. I nearly forgot the most important thing on the Christmas list. Ooh. Feel that. See, that's a proper... You could kill a person with that. Imagine dropping that off at t'car park. Years ago, I was in a different supermarket, and I'd just announced that my first marriage had ended. And I went up to the guy and went, "Can I have a chicken?" And this old woman came up and went, "Spending Christmas on your own?" LAUGHTER Johnny, you went to boarding school. Tell us about that. I didn't go to boarding school. I went to seminary school. Big difference. Boarding school is where you pay, basically, for an education. I went to t'seminary to train to be a priest. Right. And the church work out what your family can afford and then your parish pays the rest. Oh, right. I was away from home and, do you know what, I missed it. Didn't you say to your parents, "I don't want to be here?" I didn't like to. Your parish, the church where you grew up, the area, you feel like you're representing. It was like Borstal and it was like being punished for wanting to do summat good. Make me a promise this year. What? Make your own stuffing. I don't even know how to make it. Breadcrumbs. Sage. Just flavourings. It's there. That's like asking me to make my own water. Shall I get some water, or shall I make my own water? I bet you rely entirely on porn and never from your imagination. Yes. # Baby, it's cold outside... # Booze. Booze. Where do you stand on Prosecco versus Cava? I'm easy, me. Put it in front of me, I'll drink it. Prosecco has made 30% of this country bad mums. Is that what you think? They even make signs. "Ooh, it's Prosecco o'clock." No, it's drinking in the afternoon. Are you a romantic person? Yes, I am. Incredibly. Yeah? When the mood takes me. Yeah? It takes just one row for me to burn somebody else's stuff. Oh, right. What were you like when you were a kid with the ladies? Always a bridesmaid, never the bride. No? Yeah. What, with your chat and your cheeky face? Were you not a young Casanova, then? Did you not indulge as a young guy? I did. I never had any of that, "Eugh, not girls." But again, going away to train to be a priest... Yeah. ..we learned to really appreciate hanging out with girls. Cos you never saw them? When you saw them, you were just like, "Please tell me anything." "Tell me what you're buying from Accessorise." Don't get me onto these sincere conversations. No, it wasn't. I was 26 before I went out with somebody. No, you wasn't. I was. 26? Johnny, have you got any stories about girls? And it was the wrong time to be with a girl downstairs? Yeah, and I don't want to talk about it. What happened? Oh, really. Seriously. Come on. Erm, I was once with a lady. My first lady. Bit more experienced than me. Yeah. And, OK, let's put it like Game Of Thrones. Yeah. It was like the Red Wedding. Right. OK. And I was told that if there was any kind of self-produced substances, that that was a sign that they were excited. So I went down to feast and hopefully offer pleasure. Yeah. And didn't realise that it was a particular time... of a month. And it's a wonderful celebration cos it's the cycle of life. Yeah. But afterwards, I said I'd walk her home and I went back to get my coat. And I'd just lost my virginity, and when I went in the house, my mum walked up and went, "Oh, my God, what's happened to you?" And I thought she knew that I'd lost my virginity. But there was blood all over my face. And she thought I'd been beaten up. KEITH WHEEZES WITH LAUGHTER And I was thinking, "How does she know?" And I'm like, "Look, just leave it, OK. It's fine." So I wore the crimson mask of a boy who had become a man. Let's get some red wine. 'Well, I guess it is the festive period. Ha-ha-ha. 'Period! It was time to check out.' Good afternoon, lads. Just put it all in one bag. I don't think I'll have it. You'll regret it if you don't buy it. When I get back on the trawler, they are all gonna laugh at me. No, I don't think so. Got to wear it. # Fisherman's Friends, Fisherman's friend # What's he doing In a big long coat? # Fisherman's Friends, Fisherman's Friends! # Sorry. # I wish I was home for Christmas. # Really good, that, Johnny. The crimson mask? You cheeky pig. Bring it in. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'm off, otherwise I'm gonna miss my ride. OK. Coat for sale! Coat for sale! # Still tagged, coat for sale. # I'll be talking Christmas gifts with Ella Eyre. Have you ever bought anyone a sex toy? Yeah, loads. What? And trying out a strange contraption with Holly Willoughby. It helps make your vagina strong again. You get a strong tuppence? I don't like it, I don't like it! # Thank God it's Christmas... # Today I've come to Friesland Christmas Tree Farm. To meet Ella Eyre from the world of music and dreams. I've dreamt about her. I haven't. Hi! Hey, lovely to see you. Are we after a Christmas tree, then? Yes. Let's do it. I said I dreamt about you. It wasn't a sex dream. We were just mates, you know. Aren't turkeys horrible-looking? Look at their necks. That's a lovely scene. That's us walking through that thing like we'd just been married. Christmas trees? I don't know anything about a Christmas tree. How involved are you with Christmas tree shopping? As glorious as they are... They smell nice. And you just love hoovering up after it. Every day. They are right beneedled bastards, though. You're still finding the odd, little sprog in like your hair or your pubes in April. How do you find a little sprog in your pubes? Well, just, like, if it is in your clothes. You mean like if you get up early and enjoy Christmas naked today. And you get... I don't know how your Christmases go. It's quite wholesome, my Christmas. I wear blue stripy pyjamas. Like the little boy in The Snowman. Not the little boy in striped pyjamas? Cos that's a very different type of film. What about your Christmas? This isn't about me. What about your Christmas? My Christmas is never the same. Cos it's just me and my mum in the UK leg of our family. So we end up just crashing everybody else's Christmas. I'm doing the cooking this year. Have you done it before? Never. What's gonna be on the table, then? Sprouts? The sprouts I'm gonna shred. And saute with some bacon. Ooh. I like sprouts. Afterwards, eating my sprouts, laid on a sofa, watching Christmas Top Of The Pops. I'm like that, "Have that, have that!" Man alive, look at all these trees. We got the owner, Toby, to show us how to cut down our very own tree with this machine thing. This one you can cut your Christmas tree down with. That's the cutting end of the deal. Is it true you can use this device to cut off cows' foreskins? Or goats? I was circumcised, and this reminds me of when I was circumcised. But on a more industrial scale. But they had trouble getting it off me, because it were really thick. MOTOR STARTS Oh, yeah! That's a nice one. # Rocking around The Christmas tree... # I like the size of this one. I don't feel like you're being particularly picky. No, I tell you what, if this tree was a person, it would be Peter Andre. MUSIC: 'Mysterious Girl' by Peter Andre It's got a perfect physique. It's got a nice, friendly look. Let's kill Peter Andre and take him home. MOTOR STARTS Timber! CHEERING So, Ella Eyre cut down the tree. It's a nice-sized tree. She's a bit concerned that she fucked it. That's her words, not mine. I wouldn't swear at Christmas. But you think you fucked it? If I was selling the tree to someone who thought they were buying like a six-footer, it's more like a five-footer now. It's taller than me. I'm six foot, so I'd say it's about seven. Well done. # I don't want a lot for Christmas # There is just one thing I need # And I don't care about no presents # Beneath the Christmas tree... # After we'd chosen our tree, it was time to meet the king of Christmas himself, Santa Christmas. As if by magic, it's snowing. Hallelujah. Sang by Alexandra Burke. # Hallelujah, Hallelujah... # So, here we are with the main man himself. Mr Claus. Mr Claus, hello. Hello. I brought Ella Eyre here. What do you want to ask him for this year? Please, Santa, for Christmas, can I have my cat back? Where's your cat gone? So, my mum was looking after my cat when I went on tour. About three years ago. And refuses to give me my cat back. It's been a three-year ongoing argument. I will have a word with your mum and I shall do my best to get your cat back. Please. What would you like for Christmas? Well, I don't want to turn this programme into a political rant, but if you could sort out Brexit, cos it's boring the... boohahs out of me. I don't swear in front of Santa Claus. Santa's special picture. Wow. It doesn't get any better than that at Christmas. Now off to Birmingham to visit their famous Christmas market for a spot of mulled wine. Mm, warm booze. Ella, it's a lovely day, isn't it. And speaking of "lovely day," are you loved up at the moment? I am, yeah. I've been loved up for a while. Have you? About three years. Is this the one? Yeah, I think so. Is he a famous person? No. So he's a regular dude? Regular in everyone else's eyes. And spectacular in mine. Right answer. Thanks very much. When was your break? Was it Bastille? Er, it was, it was sort of Bastille, but it was Rudimental. Rudimental? With Waiting All Night. Yeah. 2014. I'd say that was probably like my big break, cos I performed on The Brits. And I remember leaving the O2. I saw that. Went to BRIT School, didn't you? Yeah. Did musical theatre, jazz hands. Do you ever forget any words when you're performing live? All the time. Do you? It's actually quite embarrassing now. It's quite a strange thing to have to google your own lyrics before shows. The intro will be happening, and I'll be like, "I hope you guys know this one." And in my head, I'm going, "Cos I fucking don't." # Christmas time, Mistletoe and wine... # So, here we are in this Christmas market in Birmingham. I've got some doughnuts here for us. What's that? You've got a black tit and I've got a pink tit. They are fucking naughty, them, aren't they? What is that? Oh, it's a sweet. That was very sexual. Was it? You're creating quite the crowd around here. You've worked with me loads of times. You've been on Celebrity Juice. Do you get nervous when you come on Celebrity Juice? No. The first time ever? The first time ever, I was so drunk that I had the fear the next day. The real fear? Yeah. The fear was like, "Oh, fuck. "What did I do?" Do you get in trouble from management if you say the wrong thing? No, that's my mum. "You should have said this." I've already got notes of things I should say on this show today. I haven't read them cos it winds me up. Right. "Make sure you do this and make sure your personality comes across. "Make sure you're a bit sassy, but not too much." # Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus # Right down Santa Claus Lane... # I'm lactose intolerant. What will that do to your poo chute, though? Things that don't need to be discussed. Some white chocolate, two of those, please. Two of the caramel pistachio, please. Whisky balls. Do you like whisky balls? Yeah. I like whisky balls. I reckon that's good for me. I'll shit for a week. But I'll enjoy it. Will you? # Right down Santa Claus Lane... # OK, we're gonna do some quick-fire questions. Here's some quick-fire questions. Go. What's your favourite part of your body? My boobs. Have you had a Greggs vegan sausage roll? Yes. What's your favourite wood? Walnut. Do you believe in sex on the first date? Yes. Have you ever put your finger in your bumhole? I'll take that as a yes. Have you ever masturbated more than twice in a day? Yeah. Have you ever bought anyone a sex toy? Yeah, loads. What? I just like to make sure all my friends are having a good time. They are all orgasming? Yeah. It's important. That's the end of the quick-fire round. Great. Let's walk around Birmingham a little and then go home. Love it. All the best. Ella, thanks for shopping with us. Thanks for having me. I learned things about you I didn't know. Did you? Yeah, that you buy sex toys for people. And you masturbate more than twice a day sometimes. I don't know if they'll put that in, but that's what I learned. All t'best. Go this way. I'll get you a bratwurst. Bratwurst. After the break... I'll be festive shopping with my pal, Holly Willoughboozy. I can't undo this. Do you want me to undo it for you? No, I've done it. Done it. Panic over. OK. Next, I've come to right fancy Knightsbridge. Ooh, look how posh it is. I bet the Queen shops here. Talking of queens, I'm meeting the Queen of Morning Telly, my old mucker, Holly Willoughboozy, starting with a drink, obviously. Why is it snowing inside? Ah, that's better. Holly, I'm here. There you are. Look at you. You look amazing. Look at you. Cheers. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. It will go up my nose now. So what are we shopping for today? Ooh. That's punchy. I'm looking for something Christmas party season. Are you looking for a party dress? Party dress. Are you very Christmassy? I'm asking you questions I know the answers to. What's your name and what's your secret? I'm not telling you those. You will do. You know most of them. This is weird you asking me questions. I know that's the format of the show, but it is weird. But it's so the audience at home can discover secrets about you, and go, "Isn't she nice in real life? "Cos I thought she'd be a gobshite in real life , but she's nice." Are you in charge of Christmas in your house? I love the shopping. Do you put the decorations up? No, I do, but my sister does help me now a bit more. When someone mentions your sister to me, the first sentence that comes to my mind... Is it something in Welsh? Yes. You can't. I can't remember where we were, but we were talking about accents. And she said, "I can do Welsh." She just says, "I've got a tidy, tight twat." LAUGHTER Happy Christmas, Mum. Merry Christmas. She doesn't know that story about my sister. Anyway, shall we go shopping? Let's go shopping. Hold on. Mm. I'm dribbling. Jesus! Happy birthday. I'm not sure that's very festive. Come on, let's go shopping. Ah, clothes. Let's go down another floor. Oh, chocolates. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Booze. Is it a boozy Christmas at your house? Yeah. We go in early. A bucks fizz in the morning. For breakfast? While I'm opening my stocking. Obviously. Tell me the Christmas morning, what happens? All into the bed. Open Christmas stocking. I always get a chocolate orange at the bottom of my Christmas stocking. You have a stocking? Don't you? No, I have a sack. I don't want to know. I don't mean a ball sack. What do you mean? A big hessian sack... Oh. OK. ..that says "Lapland UK" on it. OK. Right. No, I've got a stocking. So you have a little champagne in the morning? Yeah. That's like the 12 days of Christmas. If I could choose any 12 days of Christmas, it would be like... # On the first day of Christmas, My true love bought for me # Some champagne cru # Cristal! # I could go on. Anyway... Hang on a minute. This is my 12 days of Christmas. Why have 12 days when you can have 24? Look how excited she is just by booze. Do you like chocolate? I like chocolate, yeah. # Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring... # It's good, isn't it? Mm. Do you like gin? Yeah. That is so horrible. Would you have something like this? No. I'd have something more like this. Unicorns is a big thing for you. This is gin and raspberry, but look, it's got glitter. This is Christmas morning. Cheers. That's lovely. Oh, yes. But when I had it when I was a little kid, it were like drinking venom. You're not meant to drink as a kid. Holly has been married to TV executive Dan for 12 years with a bit of lemon on t'side. I'm only kidding. I thought I'd ask her how it all started. We were doing Saturday morning kids' telly. What was the show you were doing? Saturday Showdown. We had a producer that was there at the very beginning, and he left. And then I walked into the studio and Dan was there as our new producer. And I thought, "I'm gonna hate this guy." You didn't fancy him straightaway? No, not at all. He'd come from MTV and he was very cool for school. And I was in the studio doing weird pirouettes and things. Stupid. He looked at me like I was just this sort of wally of a person that was spinning around going, "La-la-la," and I thought, "Oh, my God, he hates me." You thought, "He's a dickhead." A little bit. And then we became really good friends. We were in the bar and we cheers'd over a glass of champagne. And I looked at him, and as we cheers'd, it was like, "Oh, my God, I fancy him. "Oh, my God, I fancy him." What, in that second? In that second, I just knew. It was like this little sparkle. It was like a spell. That is weird. And then I knew. And I thought, "Oh, my God, I do." That's it, and then we were together after that. I cheers'd with him and I didn't fall in love with him. What is that magic he's got? I just let him suck me off and then I continued with my dinner. Right, thanks very much. That was lovely. Thank you. Where to now? Dresses. You want a dress. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, this is very colourful. Yeah, but not very Christmas party. So, we see you every day with your TV husband, Schofield. Schofield, yeah. What would happen if Schofield left This Morning? Whilst we are walking. Would you stay, or... Would I go? ..would it depend on who it is? We've always said right from the beginning that if either of us didn't do it, then we wouldn't want to do it. I can't imagine This Morning without Phil. Do you think you'll do it forever? I've been doing it ten years. It feels like forever. For a long time, I felt like the new girl. I was a big fan of watching the show. Watching Phil and Fern and they were my This Morning presenters. So now when I say it feels like forever, it's because it feels nice. I feel we're getting really deep now and I want to get deeper. But not in front of an escalator, so let's go somewhere else. Can we look at sparkles? I love this. It kind of says Christmas. Yeah, it's like what Santa wears. All sparkly. Silver. Blue just says Margaret Thatcher. A little bit. And that's not Christmas. Or you could dress like Bianca from EastEnders. AS BIANCA: Ricky! Ricky! Do you like feathers? I like Fraggle Rock. Well, then, you'll like this skirt. It's very Christmassy. Ooh, sexy Santa! Do you like? I like it. If I didn't know you in real life, I'd have blown my pants now. That's a lovely thought. I've got one more to try on, then decide. Yeah, good. Stay there. I definitely will be masturbating tonight. Wow. I can't undo this. Do you want me to undo it for you? Oh, no, I've done it. Done it. Panic over. OK. Holly, have you ever worn shoes whilst having sexy times? Yes. Oh, my gosh. We'll talk about that later, then, in more detail. Maybe off-camera. Right, this one is quite... I like that, too. You know what you look like? A turkey? A sexy disco ostrich. I like that. I'm gonna get this fluffy fluff. Both look nice, but go for the fluffy fluff. Go fluffy fluff. Great. Holly has picked out a Christmas party dress. Now it's time to get serious. When you were young, were you a pene magnet? No. I wish I had a picture of me at school. So, picture this, I had really bad teeth. I had braces on my teeth since I was a kid. I had ones that came out and I kept losing them. Then I had a head brace. So I had a head brace with a thing that stuck on the back of my head, with two wires that came out. Like out of my mouth. What, like in a comedy film? Yes. I had this. So, to answer your question, no. So you're the true swan story. Totally and utterly. If you ask my school friends, they cannot believe what I'm doing. Because I had my school jumper over my hand like this. And I'd have it round my mouth. And if anybody spoke to me, I literally would talk like this. Shy? And I didn't want to show my mouth. So what happened? What, to me? Where did it come from, all this, "I'm now gonna do TV?" You were a model, weren't you? I was. So you must have known you were fit then? That was the turning point. Did you wake up and just go, "Check me, boy, I'm fit?" I went on a school trip to The Clothes Show. And I got spotted by Storm, a modelling agency at the time. Obviously my teeth were fixed by then. Were you walking around with a head brace? "What, you want me to be a model?" That had all come off by then. So it was an amazing thing to happen. As we explored the department store, we found it had its very own health spa. Why don't we pop in? Holly is currently sitting on the Kegel Throne. It helps you perform 11,000 Kegel exercises. What are Kegel exercises? It helps make your vagina strong again. You get a strong tuppence? Women of a certain age, or after you've had a baby, those muscles get kind of looser. So you just pee yourself? Well, it can happen. And it does improve orgasms as well for both the sexes. Does it? How does it? He's like, "Budge up." Is Holly gonna have an orgasm on television? If she sits a little bit more forward, then she possibly could. What do you mean? Holly, get in there, and then you're gonna have an orgasm. I'm beginning to think this is a really bad idea. Is she gonna light up a cigarette afterwards? HOLLY LAUGHS It would be weird if you just disappeared. Hang on, I can feel tingling. Like pins and needles in your butt cheeks. Argh! Stop it. Make it stop. It feels really weird. Does it hurt? I don't like it. What happened? It felt like something was pulling down. That's what it does. Pulling down? It felt like something... Do you want to try the second one? SIMPLE TUNE PLAYS I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. You sit down on there. Turn it down. Have you got anything metal? No. It doesn't feel right. That does not feel right. Can you feel it? Yeah, it's in my arse. Ooh! Ooh! Oh... What does it feel like? I don't mind it. What? KEITH LAUGHS I thought I was gonna shit my pants. I like it. Good. Do you want one of those for Christmas? I love pins and needles in my arsehole. That doesn't surprise me. 'Oh, my arsehole. 'As my time with Holly was nearly up, 'me and my freshly squeezed waste pipe 'are going in for some final questions.' # Holy night... # Holly, quick-fire questions. Go on. What bad habits do you have? Possibly having one too many drinks and eating the contents of my entire fridge. If you had to be a lesbian, who would you be a lesbian with? What, someone that I think is a really beautiful woman? Someone you just want to get down on your knees and mot them out until your lips are hurting. Hmm. Who would you like me to say? You and Demi Moore. OK, Demi Moore. Would you ever have cosmetic surgery? Possibly. One day. I don't think you can rule it out. Have you ever kissed a dog too romantically? Er, well, I tell you what did happen, my friend had a dog called Bob. And she went to kind of throw the dog on my lap. And as I went, "Argh," the dog landed across my face. Its cock went in your eye? Argh! In the mouth? Yup. You dirty bitch. I know. Earlier, we talked about your nice experiences in shoes. What were those experiences? Please, pray, do tell. Er... Well, they were nice experiences, Keith. What, like keeping the shoes on and nothing else? Sort of experiences? They were just nice experiences. Experiences that are mine and not... Didn't you feel a bit naughty that you was on the bed with your shoes? No. Were they like a high heel? You're not gonna tell me, are you? No. It's Christmas, baby Jesus' birthday. Having sex with shoes on, that's naughty. Well, you got your Christmas dress. I did. I got it. I'm very pleased. I really enjoyed myself. You're good to go shopping with. And I promise you, if you stop giving me the eye, I'll go for a beer with you, just me and you. Come on. Don't give me the eye, though. Cos it makes it weird for me. There's me and Michelle in our new glasses. Here is Michelle getting ready to do stocking stuffing. Johnny still hasn't taken that coat off. Ella and Peter Andre are very happy together. Holly and me went out on the lash. I'm still recovering. Merry Christmas. HE RETCHES Came out of both ends then. Subtitles by ITV SignPost
