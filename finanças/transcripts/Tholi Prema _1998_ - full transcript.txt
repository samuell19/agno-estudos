- l'm very tense. - Why tension? Disco is meant for Couples only. Are we allowed with out boys? lt's not a problem. Boys are available for hire at reception. - We can select any boys we like to gain entry. - lt looks strange! - How many boys you want? - Call the boys first. We'll see and tell. Ms. Kamala should select. You're called. ''Get in, l say.'' Our boys never danced so crazily so far. Whom will you select? Our Balu? ''Oh! Come on, Balu.'' ''Why are you running away, Balu?'' ''- How come you are here, dad?'' - Fool. Sleeping even after 6 am? Am l sleeping? Why do you talk rubbish? Fool. l'm shouting like siren. You're still sleeping? Time is 6 am. Should l awake you? ''Get up, l say.'' Oh Lord Eshwar! Save us. Saintly brother! l've become a scapegoat for both of you devotees. Drop a letter after reaching safe. My Lord Shiva! Our savior! ''- Salutes, Mother. - Today is'' 'Shivaratri'. Smear holy ash. ''- l don't like all this, you know?'' - Your dad will scold. - l too. Look here. You are scared of your husband. l'm not. Understand? ''- What's up? - Nothing, dad.'' ''Today is 'Shivaratri', isn't it?'' l'm asking mom as to what verses l should recite in praise of God. - Who will smear here? - Fool of an ass. Devotion should spring from heart. lt will not come by force. ''l'm the heir of uncle, you know?'' l'm an atheist. Understand? - Your uncle? - Yes. - Go and watch him. - Lord Simhadri Appanna! - Uncle! You too changed? We are scared of him as we are his sons. Why do you fear? ''You're his elder brother, isn't it?'' ''Moreover, you're Ex-Colonel. '' lt is not so. Your dad respects me as father and as head of the family. ''So, l locked all my desires '' in a locker in Syndicate Bank. Leave it. l had a strange dream. ''Girls were after Boys, uncle. '' - Are you crazy? ''- lf l'm crazy, you're a broker.'' You're the supplier of girls. One beautiful girl among them ''was after me, uncle.'' - What happened? Did she hug you? ''- No. Meanwhile, dad interrupted.'' ''- There also? - Yes, uncle.'' He is chasing me wherever l go. Your dad looks blunt but ''how much he loves you, you know?'' What for this worship you know? - Brand new Yamaha bike is waiting ''for you out side, you see? - Bike!'' Thank you very much for ''buying a bike for me, dad.'' Yes. Eldest son did Engineering. l did not buy even a bike for him. Second son is studying MCA. l didn't buy even TVS 50 for him. You passed lnter with great difficulty and joined BA now. God only knows when you will get through it. Tell me sincerely. Do you really need a bike? Bike is not bought for you. lt is for domestic use. Get lost. - Give me the key. ''- Brother! - Give me, l say.'' - Balu. Please wait. - l don't want. - Wait. - No. - Wait. Wouldn't you listen to me? - l don't want. Look here. Why do you bother about his words? l bought this bike with my provident fund for you. Yes. - Really? - l wanted to give it to you with the hands of your dad. - He hissed as usual. - Thanks ''a lot, uncle. - You're my heir.'' lf you stick crazy stickers and ''make it like a circus bike,...'' .. l'll sell it as old iron. - What will you do if l cheat you? - l know you will do so. That's why l wrote love letter to you sister also. Garlands! Worship! Nonsense! How much is the ''collection, Joseph? '' ''Collection is nil, Balu.'' l should strive at Bus stand. - Subbu! Our boys didn't come? ''- Get in. Hurry up,Balu.'' - What happened? - Come in. ''Come on, l say. - What happened?'' Balu. Come in. He is coming. - Why are you here? - What ''happened, you know? - What?'' ''- Our Shakila, you know?'' - Shakila? - DSP's daughter from L quarters. - Yes. Shakila. So? Our Boggu Suryarao wrote love letter to her. - My God! What next? - She might have informed her parents. They are ready to beat our boys. That's why we are hiding here. - Where is that rascal Boggu? - Wait. - Get up. - Do you have common sense? Why did you do so? She was smiling whenever ''l saw her, Balu. '' - She might have taken you as a joker. - You took it as love. Wait. They will come and make kheema out of you. Your friendship put us at the wedge of death. Look at Arnold. He is doing exercise to get rid of tension. - What for? - To escape. l don't know. lf they come to beat us l'll also join them to beat you. - This is a nice idea. - That's why l gave. ''Look here, Balu. '' Everybody is threatening me. Shut up. ls there any rule that he should not love DSP's daughter? Don't worry. l'll take care of everything. Look there. Shakila is coming. - Come on. - What? - She looks beautiful. Look at her colour and compare with your colour. Do you need her? lt is not as serious as you feared. ''She is coming alone, you see?'' - l see. - She is the daughter of a policeman. - They send her first and follow her to beat us. - Don't go out. Oh! Letter! - Subbu. Give what all our boys want. - Read the letter first. This is the first love letter in my life. These are all natural in life. Read the letter first. Boggu is over acting. - l'll hit you with my sandals. - What is wrong with you? Have you ever seen your face in a mirror? Does it need a love letter? lt is full of spelling mistakes? Who has given this advise to you? - Beat him to death first. - Why do you beat him? lf l want l can inform my dad and put you in jail. But l won't do so. ''You know why? Though you are ugly,'' you lured me with your sincere love. Come to lndira Park tomorrow. l'll be waiting for you. - Start. - What's this? - l'll tell later. Start first. - Alight bike first. - Signal will be given. Start first. What do you mean by suddenly riding bike and asking me to start? - l'll tell. Go fast first. - What's that urgent? - l'm in great tension. Go fast first. - Very urgent work! God! l don't know what happened there. Go fast first. - Don't stop for signal. Keep on moving. - My God! - Okay. Stop.- Priya has come. - Usha. Got tickets? My Goodness! How tense ''l was about tickets, you know?'' Bus also did not come. l got this mad fellow in time to drop me. You know him? He is my brother. Brother. Go back to house carefully. l'll come later. - Come home. l'll tell you. ''- Get Lost, l say. '' ''Hello, uncle. Hai! '' Hai aunt. What is this? Uncle is mum there and you are silent here. - What's wrong with you? - Don't talk. - Then l'll start. - Why didn't you come last week as promised? - ls it so? l feared something else. ''Look here, aunt.'' ''lf l come often, why should l stay'' in hostel? l could as well be here. ''No. lf yourself, your brothers and'' ''uncle join, studies will be ruined.'' - You better stay in hostel. - Could you realise? - Aunt. Come here. - What is the matter? - Two white hairs. Why don't you apply dye? Keep quiet. Take bath. l'll serve breakfast. - Divali is in 2 days. All the works are pending. - Where's Balu? He went to station. Your mom and ''and dad are coming today, you know? '' ''- Salutations, uncle.'' - What happened to Kavita? Appi. Don't over act. ''Salutations, aunt.'' ''- How are you, Damu? - Fine.'' - Why your teeth are dirty? No. l applied Henna. This is the latest fashion. That colour is not the beauty of henna. lt is Manikchand's smell. ''By the way, you've come for Balu.'' What's the matter? l've come for combined study with Balu. How attentive you are to studies! Why don't you ask Balu too to study? He is always scolded by his dad. How many times l told him to study? l told in the voice of Saikumar. But he put a deaf ear. l dwell on studies round the clock. ''Whenever l'm free, '' l use to help my daddy. How lucky your parents are to have a son like you! l'm gifted by God! Why did you come here? How many times l told not to roam like Goorkha near our college gate? Would he roam near your college gate? Why do you talk nonsense? ''Yes, aunt. He teases girls'' there for hours together. ''Though they spit on his face, he '' would repeat it with out any shame. l lose my prestige as he is the friend of my brother. - What's all this Damu? - She is joking. lf it a joke that the girl of Srikakulam beat you with sandals? - lt is already set. - ls it set?! - Yes. ''He confessed you see, aunt? Will'' brother be okay with his friendship? See. lf you come here again... Stop here. Hai Damu? What happened to you? - l've come in inauspicious time. Who are they? - Aunt and uncle. - l see. Welcome to you. - Aunt. He is my friend. - Come in. - Balu. Just a minute. Where's you bike? - Anil took it. Our Sekhar attempted suicide. - My God! - Don't worry. He is safe at home. Let's go. - Come on. ''- Where are you going, Balu?'' ''- l'll be back soon, aunt.'' - He studied well. l don't know what went wrong. - Calm down. Should he attempt suicide if he fails in examinations? - Don't worry. What happened? - What should l say? ''He brought marks list, entered '' his room and closed the doors. God! Would anybody attempt suicide if he fails in examinations? Don't worry. ''He is safe, isn't he?'' You must be proud of begetting a study minded son in these days. Balu. Come to the 1st floor. He is there in the 1st floor. Have you common sense? Should you attempt suicide if you fail? ''lf you fail in March, you have'' September. Why did you do so? - What happened? - Vishala cheated me. Her marriage is next week. Mother told something else. ''lf his mother comes to know, '' he need not commit suicide. She will strangle him to death. - l cannot live with out her. - She is not at fault. She is ready to come with him. But he is scared. Will she come to any place you suggest? This is enough. Your marriage will take place in Venkateswara's temple tomorrow. - lt is my responsibility to bring ''her. Okay? - Thanks a lot, Balu.'' Would anyone attempt suicide if he fails in examinations? He is a good boy. Why did he do so? Where are you going at this late hour? - Am l not asking you? - Sekhar will be married in the morning. - So what? - Would there be no need of a bride for a marriage? ''So, will you kidnap her?'' Will she be ready? ''No, brother. Please. '' ''Very dangerous, brother. '' -lf something happens to you? ''- Get in first. - Please, brother.'' - l'm telling you. ''- No, brother.'' - Uncle has come. Please come. - Coming. Wait. - He is caught. - Where are you going? - Don't shout. Anakonda will get up. - Where are you going? - Come closer. - Where? - Send in that monkey first. - Get in l say. ''- Where he is going you know, '' ''uncle? - Get in, l say.'' - Listen. - Get in. - Get in quietly. Get lost. Open the gate first. You said it is an important matter. What is that? l've stolen Rs.2000 from your box. Why she is wearing vail? l cannot perform this marriage. My God! You are wrong. My name is Usha. My dad's name is Subrahmanyam. We are Hindus. l dressed like this not to be identified. Any more problem? - Only one problem. Sekhar has not come so far. What? Sekhar has not come so far? What's all this Balu? Don't worry. Wait. Have you common sense? l took a lot of pains to bring her here at night. - Didn't l tell you? - He promised to come by 6 pm. - Where is Tavu and Boggu Surya? - We sent for police protection. You fools. Her dad is MLA. l must hit myself with footwear for entrusting you that responsibility. - My God! Our dad! - They came to our house as representatives. Perform this marriage ''by hook or crook, Balu.'' - Don't create any fuss here. - What is this? ''Having kidnapped our daughter, why '' do you say that we create fuss? - Usha. Come on. Let's go home. ''- Balu! - Listen to me, Sir.'' ''lf you do like this, your '' daughter will commit suicide. - l see. Then where is the groom? ''- Thanks, Sir. Just a minute.'' ''So, groom is not here.'' ls it not? Groom is with me. Why do you stare? lf he is ''willing, l'm also willing.'' - What is all this? - l don't ''like this marriage, Balu. Leave me.'' Then why did you threaten to commit suicide? l don't fear to die. But they threatened to kill both of us. - They will do so. - Balu is here. Groom is ready. Who will perform whose marriage? You young child! ''What's all this, Sir?'' You are my friend's father in law. No. We have to face each other from tomorrow. Didn't l say no? ''Who are you, guy?'' Don't you understand? How many times should l tell? - l'll tell in your own language. Wait and see. - My God! ldiot. You could have committed suicide. Why do you take my life? l brought you up as l brought up every one. Look here. She is younger than you. She will complete medicine. You roam on the roads and become a goon. Become a beggar at last. Why should l feel? Useless fellow. Why do scold him on the festive eve of Divali? - Neighourers would listen. - Let them listen. Let us see whether he would become wise at least then. Balu. Go upstairs. Viswanath. Leave it. Why do you scold him? His friends are such. He is with you round the clock. Are you living up to your age? You are moving and playing with children. lf you feel that l am responsible ''for your son's fall, l'll go.'' ''Why are you so harsh, brother?'' ''Get in, l say.'' You dare to perform marriage. Be creating unwanted fuss. Dad Viswam would be scolding you. Eldest uncle would be shielding you. l told you not to go in the night. Did you listen? - Did you change your mood yet? Come on. - You go. l'll come later. - Where will you go now? - Today is Divali. Come on. ''- Get lost, l say.'' Look at your face. Why do you shout? Come quickly. Why do you worry for such a petty thing? May l keep you in good mood? Why do you squat on the road ''awkwardly, Balu? '' When did you come ''from Bombay, brother?'' l've come just now. ''By the way, did dad scold you? '' l searched for you everywhere. Mom was crying and fasting for you. Come on. Sit on the bike. Why do you sit like that? Take bath and seek blessings from uncle. Okay. Come on. - My God! - Go and catch them. - My God! - Go and catch them. - Come on. Hurry up. - Come on all of you. Why do you run away? - Stop. - They are coming. Drive fast. - l'll flay you all. - Drive fast. - lncrease speed. l salute you. ''Keep quiet. Or else, l'll '' kill you. Don't over act. What's wrong with you? You broke his head even before starting match. That batch is at logger heads with us. What will happen now? l made a mistake. l'll go and apologise. Will go and apologise? They will cut limbs and make it as chicken 65. Keep quiet. Siva. Let our boys be Alert. ''- Stop here, Damu. - Why?'' Why don't you talk? - You proceed. - What is wrong with him? - Okay. As you please. - Leave me alone. Please start. They may come and beat us again. Who are you? Why do you harass me like this? Sir. Oil spilled. Bike will slip. Get aside. Sir. Oil spilled bike will ''slip. Get aside, Sir.'' l'm not a VlP. Why do you ask my autograph? You felt that no one ''should slip like you, isn't it?'' Hand is dirty. Why you too came late? - Hi Akash. ''- Where did you go, Anu?'' You came to lndia just 4 days ago. Do you know the Hyderabad traffic? Daddy is worried as you are not seen. ''Function is arranged for you, '' isn't it? Come on. Salutations. - Anu. His name is Chandramohan. - He is my childhood friend. She is his wife. - Salutations. - They came from Ooty to see you. - Dad was often telling about you. l see. lt is destined that .. .. you should come to your grandpa only after the death of your parents. - Who is throwing party today? - l. My darling got medicine seat. - ls it? - Yes. - Then she will not be yours. - Have you seen Balu? - He won't even touch these things. - He is dull now days. Did you observe? - ls it?. Call him. ''- Come on, Balu. He is refusing.'' - He won't come. Let us start. Our Balu is sadly standing there. Do you celebrate with drinks here? - What nonsense? - Our Balu is selected to South zone cricket team. ''Finals are in Bombay. lf he wins,'' he will rise to any level. He did not go. Did you ask him why? Are you friends? Damn it. Balu. What he said is true? Why didn't you go to Bombay? ''- Why don't you talk? - Somehow, '' l'm unable to concentrate. - What is wrong with him? - What happened to him? Subrahmanyam. Mosquito repellent sprayer has come. ''Cover 'Samosas' etc., with cloth.'' We don't know what they eat. - Balu has come! - He has gone just now. - What happened? - l'm going. - Where? - What happened? - What happened to you? - What is wrong with you? Stop it. Why do you shout? l thought you are the only ''silent man in our batch, Balu. '' - One girl has trapped you too ''into love. - Keep quiet, l say.'' lt is not what you imagined. l want to talk to her directly. - What will you ask? - 'Who are you?' '''What's your name?','' 'What's our relationship?' 'Why do you make me sleepless?' l'll pose these 4 direct questions. Good. Balu. Why this appears like love? Aaranaalu. Enlighten him. ''Look here, Balu. There are six'' Ladies Colleges in this city. There are 7 co-education colleges and 20 Junior Women's colleges. ''There are 24,654 girls in to.'' ''Out of it, 2,1 12 are A class girls.'' The look like Angels descended from Heavens. They use to come college and go majestically. ''Next, there are 8,226 girls.'' ''They believe in cosmetics, Fair '' and Lovely and Beauty Parlours. They do not come out with out ''make up. Means, they buy beauty. '' ''Moreover, there are '' ''14,328 C class girls.'' They are girls only by shape but do not have any special affects. ''Squinted eyes, Suppressed noses,'' ''Coconuts etc.,'' - l loved and you got us married isn't it? - What is her class? - C class. - Damn it. - His class. - 7 boys were after her. 3 boys wrote love letters. One boy burnt himself by pouring kerosene. l was damn tired by the time l overtook them and married her. ''Even for C class, there is heavy'' competition. - What is the class of your girl friend? - A class. ''My God! A Class? A class means,'' ''8:3, 3;2, 2x3, 3x 2.. '' Boys of 34 areas are covering her. ''Already,138 guys wrote love letters.'' 20 boys must be in waiting list. 3 or 4 boys must have died. - What is this nonsense? - You might have seen her yesterday. Some one might have seen day before yesterday and somebody still before. Are you the only guy who have eyes? ''Actually, how 2,1 12 angels ..'' .. are sufficient for such a big city? There is heavy competition. Everyone one is roaming around the country like ghosts.. .. in Ceilo cars with cellular phones. ''There is heavy competition, Balu.'' Why all this? Don't be depressed. Find some good figure of our area and love her. One job will be over. What do you say? You get aside. You come here. - What? - There is a good figure in his area. - Who is that figure not known to me? - Your sister. Don't love with an unknown girl. ''Definitely, she will cheat you.'' You are too weak in the case of figures. He wants an A class figure. ls it possible? - Come on. - No. - Why are you so dull? - Okay. Pray Lord to give you ''wisdom. - So, am l not wise?'' This is the problem with you. This deity is very powerful. - All desires will be fulfilled. - ls it? - Yes. Do you want to apply a line of vermilion on my face? No. Go. Please go. You would harass me for the sin of accompanying you. Where is Anu? - Are you Mr. Balu? - Yes. - Someone is calling you. - Balu. - Mummy. - You are here? Where should l find you? How can l arrange worship if you retain worship articles with you? - My son! - Mummy. Your God is really very powerful. Wait a minute. l'll get clean shoved. Where did you go? Grandpa is looking for you. - Where are you going? - Oh God! Leave me. l'll not leave this time. Don't you stop plying mischief even in a temple? - What's all this? - Keep quiet. - l'm leaving as this is a temple. ''- Otherwise, you would have been'' ''no more. - Salute to Lord, my son.'' What is this? Calm down. - Drop me at Abids. - lmportant interview. - Don't bother me. - Please. Very urgent. - Am l your driver? Nothing doing. - Time is over. Drop me. - You ''should be dropped in Abids, is it? '' Look. An innocent fellow is coming. Wait. ''What is the matter, Balu? Every one '' is talking about you in our center. - What? - Are you looking for any girl? Could you find her? - No. - l'll tell you one thing. Don't misunderstand. - Did you go to Swapna Complex? - Where is it? - ln Abids. - Yes. - Today is Saturday. No girls miss going there. ''Go there and see. By luck,'' she may come there. Wait. He is coming to Abids. Please drop him there. lnnocent fellow No.1. Balu. lnterview is in this floor. l'll come with in half an hour. Then let us go to Swapna Complex. Let us search for that girl. ''- Come here. - What, Balu?'' - Won't l drop you for interview? Damn it. Why do you belittle friendship like this? - All of you try to heckle me? ''- No, Balu. - Don't talk. '' l did not come for me. l came only for you. Did she go upstairs by any chance? ''When did you come here, brother?'' l would have come if you called. What happened? Why are you dull? Did Visu uncle scold you? - l'm upset. - Are you upset? - Yes. ''After seeing her, '' your mind has become blank. l'm very much surprised. How come? Love at first sight! - Quite cinematic. - What? - May l tell you one thing? Only attraction is prevailing in your mind now. - How come if you just fantacise? - Attraction! Only attraction! - Mine? Come on. Let us go. - Brother! Where? Sit down. ''Whenever l see her, l don't know '' what's happening and what l'm doing. l feel as if my heart beat is stopping. You are calling it attraction. Friends are calling it love. l feel as if l'm on the wedge of death. ''At times, l feel like '' ''dying, Bujji.'' - Brother! - l felt like pouring out before you. ''- Who else is there for me, Bujji?'' ''- Look here, brother.'' ''You have told me, isn't it?'' Don't worry. What is her name? That beautiful girl is our sister in law. Okay? Brother. One more important thing than that. ''As per you description, she may be '' the girl sitting behind you. Don't turn abruptly. Look at her slowly. Hello. Baby. Hello. l'm calling you. My God! Hello. Baby. l should take his autograph. Hello. Mummy. l'm Priya speaking from Hyderabad. Brother Balu is coming to Ooty. Yes. Tonight. Yes. For studies. Yes. Okay. l'm disconnecting. Bujji. ls it a must that l should go to Ooty now? Yes. You must go. Shouldn't you complete those 2 subjects this time? You will not study if you are here. ''So, you must go to Ooty.'' l know. You are worried about ''that girl, isn't it? '' Finish off you examinations first. We will find out that girl next. Not so. My friends say that she belongs to A class. ''Only 1,1 12 girls of that class'' are there in this city. There is heavy competition. Finding such a girl is very difficult. All of them are threatening that some one may love her meanwhile. Your friends are geniuses or what? ''For instance, am l loving any one?'' No. They are talking about beautiful girls. What's the necessity now to go to ''Ooty, Anu? That too in 2nd class?'' Chandramohan uncle is daddy's close friend. Would it be fair if l do not ''see him when he is serious, Akash?'' ''So, do you go alone?'' Shouldn't l accompany you? You have exams with in 10 days. Don't you know that l don't like you to be careless in studies? - Why? This is S4. Ours is S2. Come on. - Grandpa also sighs like you. - Hello. - Here it is. Come on. - Autograph party? - We should encourage people doing good things. He is so. Still he is in the hospital. You go to estate. l'll come and take you to hospital. Nonsense. Why do you kill me like this? l would have gone by bus. - Do it first. - How can l go if you stop amidst the forest? Realised? Then wait. One car is coming. l'll request them to give lift. You die here. Will you request to give lift? Nobody will stop here. - lt is a notorious place for robbery. - My foot! Brother. Did l cheat you in any way? Ooty! Ooty is killing me. Why car is coming in reverse? Any problem with the car? Ooty! l should go to Ooty. - Please help him. - Okay. - We will go. Come. l know you previously. Do you know? ''- On that day, in temple. - No. '' ''That day, in Abids, a small baby.'' l felt like appreciating you on that day itself and followed you. ''How come you came here, Balu?'' l've come to my aunt's house for studies. Balu. Come on Balu. Don't fall. Hold my hand. How many times did l tell you not to send Anu alone? - How is Anu? - Nothing to worry. She is shocked. Come on. - Why you are so late? - What? Do you feel that bringing sandal wood is like bringing tooth sticks? Crossing each check post is like crossing a death trap. Get in. - Who is he? - When he is ''hanging on to a sandalwood tree, .. '' .. l thought it is a case of suicide. He's alive. So l brought. Let us admit him in some hospital on the way. Get in first. We searched everywhere. Details are not known. You said you do not know anything about him excepting his name Balu. What else we can do? ''When he was on his way,'' l only took him with me. ''Who is he, where are his parents,'' ''when l think of his condition, ..'' ''.. l'm really scared, grandpa.'' - Stretch leg. - You do not know even dressing. You are a doctor. Do you scold me? Rascal. - We found her whereabouts. - Who is she? My Goodness. Your brother would eye ordinary people. Do you know who is she? She is the grand daughter of the great Rajabahaddur. Her name is Anu. She is America returned. - Have you seen her? - No. ''But when we inquired about her, ..'' .. we are suspected. lf talked some nonsense .. .. we will be taken to task. ''So, we have come to tell you.'' But l doubt that she too is admitted in some hospital. - Where are you going? - Bujji. Will you give or not? - Didn't doctor tell not to go anywhere? - Give me. Let me go. Mischievous fellows! - Balu. She is .. - Bujji. - Brother. l won't allow you to go. Fracturing leg will not do? l don't mind even to die. But nothing should go wrong for her. l must see Anu. Please. - What happened? - Anu. - What? - Anu. ''Actually, the great thing is, our '' son did not even mention about you. She is Bujji. Our sister. - We do not until he told us. - Please be seated. ''Now days, children do not'' take anything seriously. Our family is in a great depression. ''Just 4 years ago, Anu's parents'' died in a flight accident. l would not got back my grand daughter if Balu did not save her. We are indebted to you. You must call on us after your recovery. - Come on. See you all. - Okay. - Bye. Balu. The girl whom you are searching has come to your house. - Luck has embraced you. - Balu. Why delay? Go and say 'l love you'. What is your master plan? Brother. Daddy has come. Your Annakonda has come. We will wait in Sudha's house to talk. Get ready in the evening. Let us go to hospital. What for? To tease nurses? l'll take him. Please go. l see. You preserve your brother in your hand bag. Brother. Anu has come up to our house. What next? l'll tell Anu about my love. Balu. You wanted to talk something? ''You wanted to talk something, is it?'' - l don't know how to tell you. - Balu. Say what you want to say. l'll do if l can do it. No problem. Tell me. You saw me only in the accident. But l loved you prior to it. l was always after you. Please. Understand my love. Please don't refuse. ''l don't know how to react, Balu.'' You are the cause of my survival. But how far it is justified to think of loving you? lf l'm the cause of your ''imagination, please forgive me. '' What will you do if she says so? ''lf you say 'l love you'''' to Anu, .. '' - .. the same thing will happen. ''- So, what shall l do, Bujji? '' Brother. You might have loved her at the very first sight. Your heart beat might have increased. ''As far as she is concerned,'' this is all nothing. She is grown up in foreign. She is more matured than both of us. ''- So, Anu will not be mine?'' - Why can't she be yours? What is lacking with my brother? Love is a spring of heart. ''lf she understands your heart,'' she will love you. ''Make friendship with her first,'' if you want her know about you. lt may take a very long course of time for it to happen. Love needs not only adventure but also patience. Love has more forbearance than the Mother Earth. Mother Earth. Forbearance. Patience. Nonsense.1 ''Your sister is a prophet, isn't it?'' Listen to her. Priya is a good girl. An intelligent student. A wonderful girl. - What's this? Beer in restaurant? - Nair. Matter is serious. Go. - Carry on. - Life should be for love. You have already given it. You should become friend first. Then you should become lover. ''Afterwards, if she deceives saying'' ''that be a friend but not a lover, ..'' - .. then what you will do? ''- lt's latest fashion, isn't it? '' Then he is sure to fail every year due to her memories. ''Otherwise, he never fails'' in his life. Keep quiet. What Priya said is correct. Try to be her friend first. - How to become a friend? - lt is not fair if you search for her now. ''lf she treats you as friend,'' she will come to your house. - lf she does not come? - She will not be yours. - Be cautious. May l follow you? - No problem. - Where were you through out night? - ln Sudha's house. Why don't you stay there? ''To come and go at your free will, ..'' .. is it a house or a lodge? You did not realise after breaking leg. Go. ''- By the way, Anu came yesterday'' for you. - When? Actually when? You wanted to have tuition for the next semester. Did you pay fee? - No. l did not pay. - Do it first. Go. - Anaconda! Mummy. - What? - Anu came here? ''- Who? - Anu, mummy.'' - l don't know. l went to temple. You would always go to temple. Don't you have any other work? Lord Shiva! l went to temple only for the sake of your health. Why do you roam around the temple instead of sitting at house? ''No, mummy. Anu came. '' ''That too, when he was at house.'' How can l ask him why she did come and what she said? Why did you become so tense for this petty thing? Your uncle was at house through out the day. Go and ask him. Be slow. Be cautious. - Uncle. - What is the matter? - Anu came here? Daddy told me. You could not understand your daddy so far. He said so to read your face after hearing the name of Anu. - Did you believe it? - Then didn't Anu come? Anu came. She was here for a long time. She asked about you. Where did you go? ''- What do you say now, Bujji?'' - You passed in the first exam. What are you doing ''with out sleeping, Anu?'' l'm sending E-mail ''to my friend, grandpa. '' ''- Friend means, boy friend, '' isn't it? - Margaret. ''At this hour, girls of your age are '' ''sincerely sending E-mail means, .. '' .. it must be only about love. ''l'm too far away from love, grandpa.'' ''As far as l'm concerned, youth'' is not meant only for love. lt the precious time to decide what we are going achieve in future. What do you want to achieve? l must become as great as Einstein one day or other. l must do very big researches. l must win Nobel prize. ''Why because, people must hail that '' scientist Anu is your grand daughter. - Grandpa. What happened? - Nothing. l'm proud of you. How stubborn you are to achieve at this age? - Your dream will come true. ''- Thank you, Grandpa. '' He is our younger brother. My ''hostel friends have come, brother.'' Why you are not coming to cricket ground now days? ''Change this dress, first.'' Our friends may think otherwise. This is enough for them. Don't worry. Priya. You are very lovely in your childhood. ''Always, l'm lovely.'' ''lsn't it, brother?'' There are 2 more albums. Would you like to see? - Give us. - Are you boasting yourself? l'll teach you a lesson. - Look at this photo. - Very ''nice. - She is cute, isn't it? '' - This one is ... - She is ''showing only these photos, isn't it? '' Did she show the photo in which she is clean shoved in Tirupati? Give it. Please. See today. Bujji's clean shoved story! Delay causes depression. This opportunity will not come again. Who asked you to show that photo? ''- See, aunt. - See, aunt.'' He showed my clean shoven photo of Tirupati in to all my friends. - They will tease me. - Hell with your mischief. Can't you have sound sleep with out teasing her? Always you tease her. - Monkey. l'll teach you a lesson. - Priya. Cautious. You may slip. ''- What is all this, Balu?'' - Nothing. Just for fun. What is this noise? Won't you allow us to sleep peacefully? ''- Salutations, uncle.'' - Who? Anu! How are you? How is grandpa? My Goodness! A girl born and brought up in foreign! What a respect?! Did both of you ever do like this? Why the old man is enraged? Let her go. l'll tell you. ''- Come on. - Come on, Anu.'' ''- Salutations, mummy. '' - Who is this boy? Very cute! - l'll tell. - This is the photo of our eldest brother. He is in Mumbai. - l see. - l too was so in my childhood. - Yes. He is like this now. ''- What's up? - Look here, mummy.'' Would she talk like this if my photo was taken in child hood like this? - We will take tomorrow itself. - What? Dirty fellow. Wash your face. Would you tease me? See the fun now. Don't take that soap box ''to wash your face, brother.'' Anu has come. You will be ashamed later. You are caught. - What is like soap box? - Don't you know about soap box? Come on. Sit like this. ''Actually, the matter related to '' soap box is ... Nonsense. What is this manner less talk? uncivil! l don't respect. What about my age? Why you are giving so much of build up? Tell me. ''Few years ago, we were in Tirupati.'' Then. ''- Bring coffee for Anu, Priya.'' ''- Wash your face first, Balu. '' ''- No. - Please go, Balu. '' ''One day, brother went in to the'' bath room to take bath. ''After removing dress, '' he took soap box from the shelf. That soap slipped and went out from bath room. With a fear that daddy ''may scold if he knows, .. '' ''.. forgetting that he removed dress,'' he came out to search for soap box. - Was he not a child then? ''- No, Anu. '' Then brother was studying 10th class. ''What is this, Balu?'' ''No time to enjoy like your family, '' Balu. Mom and Dad are busy doctors. ''After their sudden death, when l '' ''was feeling alone, grandpa came. '' ''By the way, why Priya is staying'' alone in the hostel and studying? ''All are guys in our family. So, mom '' brought Priya from uncle's house. We simply love her. After getting ''seat in Medical college, daddy ..'' .. joined her in hostel as she may spoil studies by staying with us. Daddy dominates the family. Eldest and youngest uncles are dummies. - Both the brothers are well educated excepting me. - Why? l've no interest in studies. ''So, l'm daily scolded by daddy.'' ''What's after all education, Balu?'' Every man has a special talent. ''lf we can identify it, we almost '' achieve the goal of our life. Shut up l say. You are killing us with your song in shrill voice. - Look. How lucky our Balu is! - Turn that side. - Why? ''Otherwise, he will introduce her '' to us and will waste our time. Turn that side. Where is he? - Who are they? - Vagabonds and wastrels. You have any boy friends in States? Yes. l've a friend called Sriram. He is my classmate. He competes with me in studies. ''So, l like him very much.'' He is my lone best friend. - Are they your friends? - Yes. Excuse me. MBA is his surname. He want to be great like Tendulkar. He handed over ball in 150 matches. He played the last 5 matches. All the five are duck out. - He wants to be great like Arnold. - He? - Why are you amazed? See. He has born only to kill us. His dad might have seized from some one who defaulted interest. He kills us with this. - Charcoal? - What is the colour of charcoal? - Black. - ls he white like George Bush? - But one thing. Don't think that l'm an ordinary man. One super figure is loving me. All of you have nick names. But why didn't Balu have? ''He is not yet caught in any matter,'' isn't it? ''Then, don't you know about that '' soap box? l see. Priya often threatens him. ls it the same? ''- Yes. - Tell us, madam. Please.'' - Balu. May l tell them? ''- Anu. Shall we go? - Okay, Balu. '' Let's meet again. Bye. - l'll tell you about soap box later. - Please tell us. Don't forget. You dare to call us vagabonds though we are wastrels? Leave him. How can we help if he feels like that? Don't talk nonsense. lf l know ''that she really loves me, .. '' .. l would have introduced to you. l've become her friend just now. ''lf l introduce now,'' you too will be her friends. Then what is the difference between ''you and me? So, l told her so.'' Balu. My friend. You crushed our hearts. - Will you get up? This is ladies' seat.- Who called us males? - God! - Shall we give? - Yes. - Okay. They offered seat as we are young. Would they offer to old women? ''We treated you as old, you old hag.'' ''Being a woman, '' do you dare to beat males? They are the women police in civil dress. The catch miscreants. - Sister! - Who is your sister?. ldiots. You tease girls in buses? - Sister. - Leave them inspector. There are more complaints in the next stop. Come on. Let us go. Your time is good. You are saved. ''lf l find you in bus again, you '' will be no more. - The broke us. ''- Go ahead, sister. We will buy'' Benz car next week. - Shut up. What is our mistake? Many people make grave mistakes. We played a small mischief. Should they beat us like this for it? l won't leave her. ''Not so, Sister.'' Are you not ashamed of laughing after getting beaten black and blue? We are left with this. They crush those caught in the next stop. Our Arnold and Boggu Sudha will board in the next stop. When l think of their condition ... Since how many days you are playing mischief like this? You express feelings too on your face! What is your name? - Why do you stammer?. ''- l'm dumb, sister. '' - How do you talk if you are dumb? ''- Sorry, Sister. - Why sorry? '' - lt is necessary for you? - Bring it quickly. - What Priya? - Will you drop me at hostel on bike? - Go by auto. ''- Otherwise, would any one of you'' drop me? - l'll come. Come on. - You sit down. - Why are you angry? Can't you go by auto? l'm unable to walk on the road. ''Jeeva gang is teasing me, brother. '' Brother. Listen. Please. - Brother. - Don't talk. ''- Just drop at hostel, brother.'' ''No, brother. l'm scared, brother.'' ''lf Visu uncle comes to know, he '' ''will stop our studies, brother. '' ''No, brother. Please.'' - Why do you stand like a eunuch? - What is this nonsense? Who is eunuch? You dare to call my brother a eunuch? ''lf you want to avenge,'' avenge me. - Brother! - Come on. - Stop here. - l stopped. What is the matter?. - This is Anu's house. - Fate! How many times you force us to roam in front of her house? You are killing us. Did you ever dare to go inside? ''lf you do not know her, it is okay.'' She came to your house twice. God! - l'm afraid a bit. - ls it? - Yes. l'm asking you just like that. Did you kidnap and perform her marriage? l think you did not do it. Why ''because, on seeing your bravery, ..'' ''.. l'm shivering. Get in, l say.'' Get in. Your limbs will be broken. ''- Come in, Balu. - Salutations.'' - Anu has gone out just now. You know him? He is Balu. - No problem. - He is Mr. Sriram. Our grand daughter's groom. l've a friend called Sriram. He is my class mate. He competes with me in studies. ''So, l like him very much. '' - We will meet in marriage. - Okay. - Bye. ''- By God's grace, everything'' went on well.- Yes. - Bye. - Salutations. - Salutations. - Bye. - Please come again. - Where did you go? - Why? Who are all these people? They are the groom's family who had fixed marriage with Priya. - Who is the groom among them? - He. ''lf l at all l marry, what sort '' ''of a guy l marry, you know? '' My groom should be No.1 in every thing. He must have a face like Abbas. He must have speed like Jockey John. He must have a body like Rambo. Eyes must be like Sharukh Khan. Will you keep quiet? Your groom can be created only on computer. Can't you do that much for your ''sister, brother?.'' - You arrange room properly. ''- What is lacking with us, aunt? '' Why do you perform her marriage with that bald headed man? He is not a wastrel like you. He is a Doctor with high earnings. l did not ask you. Don't talk. Did you really look for a groom? You might have mesmerized her. She might have nodded. - We do not nod to what all you say. - What is this nonsense? - What is this nonsense? ''- Listen to me, brother.'' - He found a groom after all. ''- Why are you exited, brother?. '' - l don't accept this marriage. - Have you become mad? ''l invited him, brother.'' He is my senior. ''With out my knowledge, he is in '' love with me since last 3 years. He has told me recently with great hesitation. ''lf he tells, would you just agree? '' Can't you ask him to find some one? lf Anu tells the same thing with you tomorrow? lt is fearful even to think of ''like that, isn't it? '' ''l thought of it, brother. lf Anu '' ''rejects you for some reason, .. '' .. l know how you will crumble with in your self. But l could realise what is love on seeing you. ''l could understand his agony. So, l '' ''accepted for this marriage, brother. '' - Should you leave today itself? ''- Children will trouble her, aunt. '' l must attend Priya's marriage too. Getting leave will be difficult. - Can't we get these things there? ''Why all this, mummy? - Brother.'' - You keep quiet. - l'll come to Mumbai along with you. - What is lacking for you here? - No. l'll go. How late the you got good times? ''Take him along with you, Ramu.'' Are you joking? All of us are well qualified in our family. ''At least, wouldn't you complete'' even degree? What is your plan? ''lf he is left like this, he will'' ''stick to B.A., for 20 years more. '' Take him alongwith you before he changes his mood. lt seems you are leaving for Mumbai today? Priya telephoned and told. - What is this suddenly? - How long l should be scolded by dad? l want to go for some job. ''By the way, any marriage?'' You came to our house it seems? Grandpa told me. Have you seen Sriram? How do you like him? - He is very handsome. - What can l tell about it? When Sriram came to lndia last ''time, l asked him to meet grandpa.'' He met. He fell in love. Grandpa did not agree first. l convinced grandpa later. ''Charu is very lucky, isn't it?'' - Charu?! - Yes. - She is ''marrying Sriram, isn't she?'' Don't you know Charu? lt is time for us to catch train. - l'm not coming to Mumbai. - Why? - What about my studies? You are all well qualified. Should l be ruined? You taught me a good lesson. For ''trusting you and buying ticket, ..'' .. l should hit me with my own shoes. ls she Anu? Your sister in law has told me everything. Our luck is always mediocre. Be cautious. - Brother. - What up? - l've no ''pocket money. Give Rs.2,000 to mom.'' - ls he your elder brother?. - Yes. - Telephone to me after reaching Mumbai. - l'm not going to Mumbai. - Why? - Brother is feeling bad. ''He says, 'Why Mumbai and all now?' '' 'Finish studies first. We will see later'. He is very obstinate. - What did you say? - What ''brother said is justified, isn't it?'' - l said okay. ''- Are you a child, Balu? '' You are changing versions from minute to minute. ''By the way, where are your friends?'' No one is seen. ''Today is Saturday, isn't it?'' Everybody might have gone to disco. - Then why didn't you go? - Don't you know? Girl is necessary to go to Disco. l don't have such habits. But l'm very fond of going to disco. ''When l went once,'' they pushed me out. Would l leave? l've peeped through glass. lt is really a great experience to dance with friends in transcendence. That is all a higher range. Come to our house at 6 pm. - Balu. - He is not here. - Balu is not there? Am l telling a lie saying that he is not at home? Give it to Balu as soon as he comes. Handle carefully. ''- What is this? - Nothing, uncle. '' Just Post Cards. Your daddy wanted 10 cards. May we give him? - No. - Then tell me what it is? Uncle. Tomorrow is Anu's Birthday. Anu should know about my love with this presentation. But l should not express. She herself should understand my love. ''So, l'm sending these 1 ,000 Post '' cards to Anu. - By sending this? ''- Do you find my love in this, '' uncle? - Who has designed this? - Our friend. - He is found. Your presentation must express your heart. She must realise that you are his life. Think on those lines. Why she is laughing? How do l look like? ''By the way, what's all this?'' Why did come in suit and all? ''- Today is your Birthday, '' isn't it? - Yes. What is this? How rich you are? l felt that on the eve of your ''birthday, as shown in movies, ..'' ..guests may do group dance dressed ''in suits. So, l've come like this. '' ''But, on coming here'' l found nobody. l don't like to celebrate my birthday by myself. You put it so easily. How much l ''strived to get this dress, you know? '' Did you buy this dress only for the sake my birthday? What is this? l only should ''give you today, isn't it? '' l must give this to you any day. But l felt like giving today. Go and open it in your house. Look at it carefully. You will understand. - Have you written it with blood? - Yes. ''Why did you do so, Balu?'' l never expected you to do like this. Why did you act like a fool? Have you come only to upset me today? ''- When did you come, Balu?'' - Just now. What presentation grandpa ''has brought for you, you know?'' ''- Why all this, grandpa? - My '' grand daughter's birthday is today. l wanted to invite the entire city. You refused. This is for your grandpa. Come on. Do you have common sense? How many ideas we have given you? Why did you do so? ''Moreover, you wrote with blood.'' We thought we belong to low class. But you proved to be still worse. - That's all old style. ''- Moreover, she cane from America.'' We should have a proper approach for what all we do. Time is good. All this happened just for writing Happy birthday. - lf you wrote 'l love you'? - Keep quiet. Everything happened excepting push you out of the house. Am l correct? Don't keep it in mind. Wash it out. What did he say? Didn't he say that an A class girl is difficult to get? - What an innocent fellow! - What is that? - Anu has given it. - Open it and see. - What is this? - l don't know. ''There is some letter in this, Balu.'' Balu. The name which l can't forget in my life. ''Why because, every moment l live'' is nothing but your boon. l feel sad as you do not have any companion though you care for others. l've come to know that you're a good cricketer. ''Some how, it seems that now days, '' you are unable to concentrate on it. You should concentrate again to become a good cricketer. Every man must have a goal. l'll be very happy if it is your goal. This presentation would always remind you of your motto. This alone is enough. Your love is fruitful. Now l understand why she scolded you. - You behaved like a low class guy. - Yes. ''When she expected so high of you,'' it's clear that you're in her heart. Express your love with out any hesitation. Please go. ''- Go. - Go ahead. - Go, Balu. '' - Go and tell us the result. - Why do you hesitate? - Come on. Proceed. Mining people placed bombs. Please stop and proceed. Why do you stare? Bombs are not exploding there. Here. What did you say the other day? Look at him. Uncle has come to play cricket again. What? ls it a bat presented by Tendulkar?. - Anu has gifted it. - Give that bat. - Will you give it or not? - Anu?! Then l'll give a kiss. Mummy. Here is a fax message. ''What happened, Anu?'' Wait. l'll telephone to grandpa. Charu. Telephone to grandpa. l'll inform grandpa. Balu. lt's a pleasant surprise. You've come when l've a good news! l've got admission ''in Harvard, you know?'' How many dreams ''l had about it, you know?'' l studied hard burning midnight oil. l've no other worry now. l'm very happy today. ''By the way, Why are you so dull?'' What's wrong with you? A small accident. l should not have scolded you like that in the morning. ''But you made a mistake, isn't it?'' Never commit such foolish things. - Grandpa. - What dear?. - l've ''got admission in Harvard, grandpa. '' l'm leaving for America with in three days. Your blessings have ''come true, grandpa.'' - Brother. Sister is calling you. - What? - Where is she? - There. - Brother. Come here. ''- Why you are here, Bujji?'' ''- Why did you call me? - Come on, '' brother. Anu is leaving for America. - You called me for this? Come on. ''- Why do you take it easy, brother?.'' ''- Come on, l say.'' - Did Anu reject your love? - No. - Didn't you tell Anu? - l'll talk to Anu. ''Bujji, Didn't you ask me to make to'' make friends and then express love? ''But after making friendship,'' l realised my foolish thinking. l nourished immense love in my heart for her. ''But in her view, l'm just a friend.'' A very good friend. That's all. When she is leaving ''abroad happily, ..'' .. l don't want to hurt her by expressing my love. Yes. He choicest way of life will make her happier then my love. Were you mad after her so far only to say this? You know the real meaning of love? Wishing the beloved to be happy. My in true love. Never she should know about my love. l do not like others to convey it. ''You will not expose it, l know.'' ls it the time to talk to brother?. Son in law is alone there. Come on. - Okay. - Hurry up. - Okay. - Brother. - What brother?. - Ask bride and groom to come quickly. - Okay. - Time is over. - l'll accompany the truck. ''- Okay. - Go. - Okay, brother.'' - Loaded everything? - Everything is okay - Quick. - Brother. Time is over. Let them be quick. - Quick. Time is over. - Adjust properly. Tie it. - Time is over. Why do you stare? - Let them quick. - Hurry up. ''- Bye, uncle. - Bye, dear.'' ''- Will you come to our house, aunt? '' l'll come after finishing the works. Please start. - Where is brother Balu? - He will be roaming. Don't wait for him. ''All are waiting for you, Priya.'' Brother. Brother. What are you doing here? l'm starting. Bujji. Are you too leaving me? Brother. ''What's all this, brother?. Who will '' have such a good heart like you? ''lf l could know predict it, l would '' have told to express your love. l myself stood in the way of ''your love, brother.'' You are at no fault in this. Calm down. Come on. All are waiting for you. ''l'm sorry, Priya.'' l'm a bit late. - Hubby. My daughter is going away from me. - Janaki. Come in. ''- Come in, Anu.'' ''- l'm jealous of you, Balu. '' - Why? - l've not seen such an interwoven family anywhere. ''- Please come in. - No, Balu.'' Flight is by 10 am tomorrow. l've come to seek the blessings of your parents. - But in their present mood... - Nothing of that sort. They feel bad if you do not inform them. Come in. - l can't live with out seeing her. ''- Janaki. - Come in, Anu.'' - Mummy. Anu has come to seek your blessings. - She will go to America tomorrow. ''- Wish you happy sojourn, dear. '' - Where is your uncle? - Uncle and brother went to drop Priya. They will come only tomorrow. No problem. l'll inform him. - l take leave of you. - l'll see her off. Balu. Don't forget. Flight is at 10 am tomorrow. Daddy. Calm down. - Will you take care of grandpa? - Sure. Anu. Why did you ask me not to come to airport? Here you can see me off boldly. You will burst out at airport. l cannot bear seeing you ''in tears, grandpa.'' Okay. Come on. ''- Bye, grandpa. - You promised '' me one thing. Do you remember?. Your education and wisdom should be for the development of this country. ''That is why, l'm sending'' my beloved alone. Grandpa. Bye Grandpa. Why did you come here at all? Why do you desert us like this? - Where are you? No body is seen? - How is the house of son in law? Very nice. l thought something else. They treated very courteously. Priya is a very lucky girl. ''But, while leaving her, '' she burst out like anything. What can l do? l consoled everybody... ''- By the way, where is Balu?'' - He went to Airport? - Airport? Wouldn't he reveal his love? ls he such a great man of sacrifice? ''Being his mother, '' wouldn't you know his mind? 20 - What can l do? He shut our mouths. - No one can shut my mouth. Look. l remained as bachelor as l did not express my love. ''He seems to be really my heir,'' simply because l called him heir. l won't leave. l won't leave her wherever she goes. ''What's up, Anu? '' Nothing. l asked my family and grandpa too not to come to airport. l asked only you to come. l am just wondering why? May l tell you? Grandpa and all others are closer to your heart. Leaving them is quite painful. l've no such scene. Leaving me is not at all painful. l'm of that type. Correct? You've learnt so many words! ''Yourself, your mummy, daddy, .. '' ''.. uncle, friends, ...'' See. l'm leaving with out seeing uncle. - Wait. Where are you going? - lnside. l forgot money in a hurry. Very important matter. - Get out. - You are talking with out knowing me. l'm ex- colonel. Why should l care? Police. Do you dare to slap me? - l must go inside. - So arrogant! - Leave me. - Balu. - What's up? - Arnold is crying there. Come once. Anu. Just a moment. - Leave me. - What's this? - He wants to reveal your love to Anu. l told you many times not to interfere in this matter. Why did you do so? You don't know him. He will silently gulp his tears after the departure of Anu. ''Whatever you do me, l'll go '' and tell her. That's all. ''lf you go and tell Anu,'' you will find only my corpse. No. Please leave it. Anu is coming. wipe your tears. ''- What happened, Balu? - Arnold '' is just upset as you are leaving. ''- What is this, Arnold? - l'll '' ask you one thing. Will you mind it? - Carry on. - You will not forget ''us after going there, is it?.'' How can l forget? You are ''Balu's friends, isn't it?'' Really l forgot. - What's up? - You should not give autograph. - Why? Balu. Why didn't you give? - Anu. What happened? - l feel l'm missing something. What about you? l'm realising now. l'm feeling it when l'm leaving you. lt is impossible for me to leave you. l cannot leave you and go. You must go. You must have to go. How much you strived for the sake of studies? All that should become a prey for a sacred love. We may become one on some day. Then will you get this opportunity? Didn't you tell that youth must set a goal? You have a motto. l too have a motto due to you. Not only for months or years. l'll await you for lives together. ''Please go, Anu.'' Love will attain our goals.
