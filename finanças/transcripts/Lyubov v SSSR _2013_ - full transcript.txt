Find out from other students what kind of professor I am and whether it's easy to pass my exams. Narbekov... I'm giving you my first and final warning. The history of the Communist Party is no laughing matter. Got it? - Yes. - Sit down and take notes. I'm telling very important and very interesting things. Under Vladimir Lenin's leadership, The Union for the Liberation of the Working Class brought about the unification of socialism with workers' movements. In December 1905, Lenin was arrested by the Tsarist authorities. Even in prison he continued his revolutionary work. In prison, Lenin helped the Union with his pamphlets and leaflets. In prison, he wrote his pamphlet "On Strikes." Hey, Styopa. You see the girl in the white sweater? - Yeah, why? - You know her? Haven't seen her before. All I know's her last name's Beletskaya. Thus the worker Babushkin, who remembered Lenin's lectures to the workers... What's her name? Lida, I think. You think? Gotta know for sure. Find out for yourself. Who's whispering over there? You again, Narbekov? You, next to him, stand up. What's your name? Molodtsov. I'm warning you, this is a bad start. Keep it in mind, Narbekov and Molodtsov. Sit down. And you, Narbekov, repeat my last sentence. Stand up please. Um... So this worker remembered how Lenin read a lecture in his free time from the revolutionary struggle. Narbekov... What was the worker's name? Dedushkin! - Dedushkin! - It was Dedushkin! - What did you say? - It was Dedushkin. Leave immediately, Narbekov... Your jokes won't work here! This is no place for farces! - Hi. - Hi. Stop, miss! You're breaking the law! - Did I scare you, Lida? - It's Lyuda, not Lida. - Sorry... - It's nothing, you got mixed up. We're in the same class, so let's be friends? All right. Let me make up for it and invite you to a movie. I'm not sure... Which? "Ivan Vasilyevich Changes Occupation" at the Art Cinema. All the girls are crazy for it, - but you can't get tickets. - I have. Look. What d'you say? - Let's go. - All right. - When did you transfer? - Not long ago.

Where's our copy of "Peoples of the World"? It used to lie here. Where is it? - How would I know? - I know. You're taking your grandfather's books and selling them in second-hand shops! - What's up with you?! - I've had my suspicions! The book disappears and you get new jeans and a jacket, you come home drunk all the time and leave restaurant receipts in your room. Following in your father's footsteps? Leave him alone! Think I don't know anything? - What do you know? - Everything. Your trips to the south, a certain Felix... Shut up! You don't know a goddamn thing. Empty your pockets. - But I was just... - Do I have to search you? I'm waiting! I'll give this money to your grandfather. It's his, after all. And you can read "Snow White"! You told her? I had a question about literature... I looked for that book and Mom came in. I should let you have it. Hey, man! Why'd you call? I need some cash, - 100, 70. - What for? A new Stones or Pink Floyd record, my mom took my cash. I barely got hold of a new guitar. Hey, we put together a group: "Red Trousers." What d'you think? Let me try one. You know Voloknitsky? A god on the guitar. Schultz has drums. Got an amp and a place. We got it made. - Who's gonna play? - Voloknitsky's lead. Vashurin's rhythm, Schultz the drums, and I'll play bass. Aces high! Can I buy you a beer? Let's go. Hey, can you play? - Anyone can! - You don't know how! I've been playing for 2 days! 2 and a half, counting this morning. Hello? One minute, please. - Grandfather, it's for you. - For me? Who needs me at all? - Tell them I'm dead. - He's dead. They wanna know when... When... Tell them 2 weeks ago. 2 weeks ago. - Good-bye. - Well done. Sergey, make me some tea. - I'm not Sergey. - Who are you? I'm Misha. You look like Sergey. Hello, yes... good day. What? Who told you that? Not at all... I'll get him. Dad! Enough fooling around! Take the phone! Yes? Hello? Yes, it's me. Yes, alive and kicking... No, I can't come, I'm ill. I'm ill! Misha, why are you playing tricks?! He has no idea. Dad, why doing this again and again? Give me some hot tea before I croak. - I'm late! - Please! Before I die! Sergey! Make him tea and stick around today, huh? - Don't go anywhere. - There's nowhere to go! All the better! - I've wanted to ask you something. - Go ahead. Is that old woman one of your relatives? What relative?! It's Agatha Christie. You knew Agatha Christie? Very well. I took the photo myself! Her husband was an archeologist... And we'd often meet in London and India. I'll be! You know, Sergey, Larisa just gave me this money. What do I need it for? Here, take it. I gave Misha some for a football. You do what you like. I know what for. Thanks a bunch, Granddad! Hey guys! I need a record: Pink Floyd, "Dark Side of the Moon." Cool off. We're just hanging out. Don't play with me. Think I'm a punk? If you don't have it, tell me who does. No one's playing with you. See that guy there? He was, like, doing business. Go ask him. What else do you have? They said you had "Dark Side of the Moon." I don't deal in contraband. What do you have? You want Tukhmanov? "My Address is the USSR." I got an extra. One from Mom, one from Dad. No thanks. Give it to your Granny. Hey, dude, you want the Stones? - You have them? - Be quiet. Take it easy. I got "Goat's Head Soup." Wow! The latest. It only came out in August. Easy. I told you I had it. - You want it? - How much? 80. - Pricey. - What'd you think? A month ago it was 120. I'll give it to you for 80. I need the cash bad. I can't go lower. I don't have 80. - How much you got? - I got 70. 70! What were you thinking, dude? It's a new record, English pressing... Wait...

Hi! Happy birthday! Thank you, Sergey! Why don't you come in the evening, with other guests? All your relatives'll come, and what'll we talk about? It's better to be alone with you, - celebrate together. - Let's go to my room. This is for you. The latest Stones record. Came out 3 months ago. It must be very expensive. Don't think about it... I didn't know what to get you, you got all these nice books... So... Are they playing Tchaikovsky? That asshole Edik ripped me off... You know, I really do like Tchaikovsky. Even more than the Stones! Really! It's really a great gift! I'm serious! Thank you! See the bass player? He's my friend, Kostya Denisov. We were in school together. Cool. - They play well, don't they? - Yeah, great. Thank you! We'll take a 15 minute break. - Hey, man! - Hi. This is Lyuda. Kostya, nice to meet you. Excuse me, listen... - Lyuda, we won't be long. - Not long at all. We'll be right back. - Hey, man! Come with us. - Where to? You know Schultz? He's first-rate. He shot down a Phantom in Vietnam. Anti-aircraft gun... blew him away... - What's that? - It's grass... - Here, man. - Don't want to. - Go on, try it. - I'm no junkie. And we are? We'll have a great time. I already am! To hell with you! Sergey, here. I'm off. - He won't tell? - No, he's one of us. Just you see... - How is it? - All right. All right means bad... Take a deeper drag, breathe in. Got it? Hey, dudes... Look... An eagle's flapping its wings... See? I don't see anything. I see it, Schultz. Only it's not an eagle, but some kind of spider... Are you out of your fucking minds? The whole hall reeks! We'll all get busted, goddammit! Put it out now! Let's get on stage... Get lost... Scumbags! As never before, Soviet international policy has increased the nation's authority around the world.

Find a moment of happiness before it flies away for ever. - Hi! - Hey! Where'd she come from? Good looking, right? Thank you! Bet you I can pick her up... Yeah, right, bright eyes. - If I do pick her up... - I'll buy you a beer! Czech! Like the one your father bought at the gourmet place and guards with his life. OK! And what if you lose? I'll take you to a restaurant. - Your choice. - And what about Lyuda? She's sick... - Deal? - Deal! Go ahead! - Hello. - Hello. I heard you're our new Old Church Slavonic instructor. I got a ton of questions... Do I really look like an OCS language instructor? - Yes. - I'm not an instructor. - Then what are you? - A first-year student. - So we're in the same class? - So we are. - So, we'll be friends? - So we will. - What's your name? - Katya. Mine's Sergei. Where'd you come from? I transferred from correspondence classes. A good decision. We have fun here. Wanna sit together? Ok... The topic of today's lecture is epic poetry. The traditional heroic poem is one of the Russian people's most significant contributions... an expression of high moral quality. An acknowledgement of great courage of the insurmountable vital strength of our people permeates the whole epos. It found its brightest representation in the images of great warriors, in their determination, their bravery... in their indomitable strength and heroic feats. The decisive meaning of the recognition of our people's invincibility was the defiance of our people in the age of feudalism against steppe nomads, reaching its greatest conflict in the epoch of the Tatar-Mongolian Yoke. Resistance to the Tatar invasion is the source of these heroic poems. "Tsar Kalin "wanted to destroy Kiev, "to slaughter its inhabitants... "to burn God's churches..." Move your foot away! I came to make up. I didn't argue with you... I just don't want to see you. I'm off! - Everything all right? - It's fine. - Where're you going? - I have a meeting. - At the institute? - Yes. Granddad, I have a favor to ask. What kind of favor? Would you phone Galina? - Who? - Galina Kazanovich. What for? She works at the Academy of Sciences. You want to get into the Academy? There are enough asses there without you. I need two theatre tickets. What's the problem? Go buy them at the box office. - You don't get it. - Well, explain it to me. There's this theatre called Taganka. It's impossible to get tickets. But she can, and she wouldn't refuse you. Bet my life she wouldn't! Why so interested in the theatre? It's not about theatre. - I had an argument with a girl... - It happens... 50 years ago I also had an argument with a girl. It seemed she preferred another. And we had to settle it with a duel, I and my rival. Yes, with swords, out in the country. - Where'd you get the swords? - It wasn't a problem back then. - Who won? - You need to ask? I knocked the sword out of the bastard's hand. We were separated, and I didn't stab him. And if you hadn't been? I'd have killed him. What about the tickets? What tickets? I want to invite this girl to the theatre. Oh yes, that's right. What's her name? - Lyuda. - Lyuda. My first love was also called Lyuda. Hand me the phone. Once I read her the poetry of Gumilev all through the night. It was a wonderful night... There was fighting in the distance, people ran by holding rifles and shouting, and none of it disturbed us. Hello, my dear Galina. Yes, it's me... I'm well, thank you... I have an enormous favor to ask. My grandson Sergey wants to get in to the Taganka Theatre. The worker Babushkin, the worker Dedushkin. We have to know all that too? Up to chapter 85. - Gosh! - I would prefer the movies. Hi! Listen, the Dean's Office is looking for you. - What for? - To send you to Berlin, - to a students' conference. - Why me? Who wrote the paper on the unemployment abroad? - I did. So what? - Go on and find out. They said it's urgent. Berlin, conference... what the hell... Why's he badgering you? He isn't badgering me. We have shared interests. What kind of shared interests? None of your business. Whatever. If you knew what I brought, you'd kiss me 30 times. - Gonna go for it? - What for? - Agreed? - Cut it out, tell me what you came to say. What's this? Two tickets to Vysotsky in "Hamlet". - Kiss me! - We didn't agree on the lips. One... two... three... four... five... When do you leave? What trip? I'll let you have it. - They probably didn't take him. - Probably. Five... five... Six!.. Mom! What happened? - Nothing... - Can you tie a necktie? No. Your father could. He did it for everyone. - Where're you off to? - To the theatre this evening. Put on your white polo sweater. Go get it and I'll iron it. Sergey, listen... Sit next to me. Listen, if anything happens to me, you'll be the most important person in the family. What can happen? Anything... Maybe I'll get married, leave you guys... Very funny. This is what you wanted to tell me? No. Just promise you'll never abandon your grandfather and Misha. - In what sense? - I'm being straight. No matter what happens. - What's up? - Nothing. Just promise me. I promise, if that's what you want. - Forgive me, Mom. - For what? For what I said... About you and Dad. Don't think about it. What a strange bird. Your dad found that while excavating Ancient Khorezm... You know, Ancient Khorezm was the City of the Winds... a vanished empire... Your Grandfather discovered it. - Beautiful. - Yes. Very... Kostya, hi. Ok... yeah, sure... In 20 minutes, in the courtyard... I'll stop by for Styopa. - Hi. - Hi. You're my real friends. You came right away. Here's what's up: we gonna bash Voloknitsky's mug in. Why, I don't get it... That sleazeball got a new bassist. That quietnik, that piece of nothing. So get your guitar and forget it. So who's gonna spit in his vile mug? Everyone's against me there, even Schultz! We're going over to his place, then? No, to the club where they practice. They got a new guitarist, so what? Chicken, are you? If you guys needed me, it'd be no questions asked! - I'm ready! - I'm ready too, only... What "only"? Go home! Run to your mommy! - Next time you come to me... - I'm going! Forward! Still here. Still haven't snuck off, the punks! You hear it? Listen... This is the wailing they call songs! Shut up there! Our ears'll fall off! What're you doing here? Want your guitar? Take it! Viktor, hand him his guitar. I'll have a new one in a month. No, you're not getting off that easy! We gonna bash you one! Don't kid around, dickhead! Beat the shit out of Schultz! Stop fucking around now! Get outta here! Everyone! I've totally lost patience! Well done! You smashed his guitar - it's over! We put an end to their sham show! Am I ok here? - Just fine. - You got a scratch on your face. Let's celebrate the wake of the "Red Trousers"! - I gotta be at the theatre by 7pm. - We got tons of time! Let's have some fun. He ran up and gave me one in the chest, I didn't lose it at all, grabbed him and tossed him 5 meters! You did well, too. You saw how Schultz went yellow on us? They were lucky the director showed up. - Got any cash? - Yeah, got my stipend. You got a car, right? You study for free at a great place? What the hell more do you need? I want freedom, man. I wanna go where I want, see what I want, read what I want. All you do is I want, I want, I want... We only live once! And what've you seen? You had too much of a good thing in England and Austria. For no reason! I live here! It's good here! Even without a car or a dacha. You're wrong, Styopa, it's better over there. We've got it good, though... Enough chatter, let's go hook up... I'm not going anywhere. - I'm going home. - Come on. - What's your name? - Lyuda. - What happened, man? - I forgot about the theatre. Oh, yeah! The theatre! Grab a taxi, you'll make it. Nah, I'm not going anywhere... I'm drunk as a skunk. How come you're not sleeping? They took Mom to the hospital. So, how's Misha? He's good. They got a football tournament at school. And your Grandfather? Grumbles, as usual. And when's your research trip? In June, on the 25th. Where're you going? To Vladimir province. It's nice there. Sergey, give me a cigarette. - Huh? - Give me a cigarette. I know you've got some. Come on, already! - You don't smoke... - I used to, in college. Light a match... Is it allowed? No. No, it's not, but I want one all the same. Light a match. Your father liked it when I smoked. He said I looked like an American actress, only I don't remember which one. I don't remember... Why'd you quit? It's bad for health. You go, Sergey, I'll be out in a week. Leave me your cigarettes and matches. Go on. Go on. Sergey! Later. Go... So you sing, Narbekov? I do. What else can a poor boy do? And did you go on an expedition gathering material? Of course! Should've seen us! Only, you know, 90 per cent of their limericks and rhyming slang is made up of uncensored swearing. - A terribly ill-educated people. - Dense... Why bring up the people... Everyone finds his own interests. Odd woman... Let's dance... - So how are you? - Not bad. You? All right, too. - Listen... - What? Let's go somewhere... - Where to? - I don't know. Somewhere else... No, Sergey... You don't love me anymore? I don't know... As you like... Can I bum a smoke? - Ever been to the Black Sea? - No, never... Wanna go with me? - When? - Tomorrow. All right, let's go... why not. Let's go. Why are you being this way with me? Here's enough for the return ticket and the room... have fun. You miss your little daddy's girlie? Like she can't find another one, too? She won't wait long... - I know she won't. - Shut your mouth! You jerk! Kostya Denisov, I'll be damned... Sergey! Hey, man! Have a seat! Let's have a drink! What brings you here? Taking a break, skipped my research trip. Good for you! Tanya, this is my best friend, Sergey. Glad I ran into you. It's so boring here. - Where're you staying? - I took a room not far from here. - And you? - I'm at the resort, Tanya too. To our meeting! - Sergey, can I have a quick word? - Sure. Excuse us, Tanya. - You got any cash? - Like 15 rubles, why? I got only one. Lend me some? That's all you took to the restaurant? It's the girl. She goes back to Moscow today, I thought, a bottle of Georgian wine, and she keeps ordering... And you arrive like a miracle. How're you? I'm ok. Hey, what's going on? So what's up? - Is she your girl, friend? - Yes! Sorry. We thought she was alone. Get lost! - Take it easy! - Guys! Cut it out! Stop! Kostya! Cut it out! Officer, we're out of cash, take this. - What is it? - A real Panasonic from Japan. Behave yourself... Give at least 10 rubles! It was bought in Japan! Go on, get outta here... Shall we take a dip? - At this hour? - Yeah, why not? All right. You got a return ticket? No. And no money. How're you gonna get back? I'll palm off my wrist-watch. There's a shortage here. What do you think we'll be doing in 30 years? You'll be the ambassador to Great Britain. And I'll be a provincial schoolteacher. Well, that wouldn't be so bad. But I mean... What? Ahh... I don't know... Listen, Kostya. I've decided to get married. I'll be! To who? To Lyuda. Remember her? I do... - You're serious? - As cancer. She expecting? No, it's not that. Well, congrats, then! Maybe I'll get married, too. - What do you think of Tanya? - She's super! Her father's the Minister of Education... ...a five-room apartment in downtown Moscow... ...studied ballet and judo. - How's that for a fiancee? - Great. It's settled. What? Let's get married altogether. - Hi, Lyuda. - Hi. - How're you? - I'm ok. - Did you go anywhere on holiday? - Near Leningrad, with my parents. - And I was in Georgia. - I see. We should get together. We really should. I'm at a payphone downstairs. I'll be right out. - Hi. - Hi. - You've changed. - No, just a new hairdo. - Where do you wanna talk? - Here. Ok, here. Or we could go somewhere, to a cafe maybe? You didn't use to invite me to cafes. You remember how we last parted? I do. I remember it all. And, you know... I'm asking you... Marry me! Sergey, there's something I need to tell you. I'm expecting. What? I'm pregnant. In my second month. Who is he? Do I know him? You know him very well. It's Styopa. Styopa... I see... You hurt me, Sergey. I was in bad shape. Do you love him? I think I do... Yes, I love him. You know he's not like you guys think he is... "You guys"?.. All right, then. See you. Hi, Sergey... - Hi, Sergey. - Hey. - How're things? - Ok... Ok... ok... You're not yourself... has anything happened? You know, Kostya, my mom's really sick. With what? Stomach cancer. She doesn't know. Her doctors told me this morning. Can we get her medicine, a good hospital? - I'll tell my dad... - No need, Kostya. My grandfather's arranged a good hospital and medicine for her. Listen, Sergey... Styopa called me up. They're getting married on the 10th, I don't know why he wants me as best man. Really? The 10th? Yeah. I told him, "what're you doing? "You and Sergey are friends." So he gets all flustered, and goes: "I've loved her since 1st grade, "she loves me, too", blah-blah-blah... Liar - who could love him. Let him take that. Turned out to be a bigger fucker than Voloknitsky. By the way, he was sentenced to 15 days in prison. No, I won't go and sit at the same table with them. Yeah... I'm off. See you. Hi Sergey. What brings you here? Decided to take a break from work? Yeah... Moscow still in one piece? I guess. Here's your tea. - Hi Sergey! - Hi Klava. When's Larisa getting out of the hospital? It's time I went home. I need to clean my room and get ready for winter. Why stick around here? In Moscow I won't come over. You can look after yourselves. Stay well. Get some rest... What rest! I'm going to make jam! Sergey, you go get the sugar, I'm no spring chicken. You know how Thengiz-Khan took Khorezm? His soldiers filled the water canals that went into the city. That simple. Come over here, Sergey. Well, has she died? Make a trip to my City of the Winds for me and Larisa. Really. The sunsets there are very beautiful. Misha! - Are you going to practice today? - Uh-huh, around 6. I've got a favor. Get on bus 144 and go to Tyoply Stan. Here's the address. - Who do you need? - Lyuda. - Lyuda! A visitor for you! - Who? - Some kid. - What kid? - Hello. - Hello. Sergey asked me to bring this. - What is it? - Our Mother's... And Sergey asked to say best wishes. From me too. Thank you. How is your Mom? She died... Excuse me, where's the bus station? There, around the corner and to the right. - Hello. - Hello. - To the City of the Winds. - What? To the City of the Winds. Do you know how far that is? 200 kilometers! 400 kilometers both ways. No, no one'll take you. Don't even think of it! - Thank you. - Take care. I need to go to the City of the Winds. I'll pay. - Where're you from, friend? - Moscow. That's a nice jacket. Brand-name? Yes. "Super Rifle". It's nice... let me have it? - Add 20 rubles and we're off. - That'll work.
