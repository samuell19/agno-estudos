I'm Marie Marney. I'm Sam Kinison's mother. That's a mouthful. But I'm very proud to be Sam's mother. Sam was very different, and he was sort of a little, uh, rebellious concerning life and the church and ministry. He never liked a lot of the confined religious rules that we had. [Sam] Whoo! I've done it, brother! I've done it, I've screamed at God at the top of my lungs 'cause that's how much I believe in Him. Amen! That's how personal I feel like my relationship is. If I can't be myself with the Father, then I'm going to stop preaching this gospel. [applause, cheering] [cheering, applause continues] Whoo! Oh, ohhhh! Oh, how the fuck are you, Hollywood?! [cheering] Oh, man. Well, I see some of you made the show, huh? All right. [cheering, applause] Oh, shit. -[woman screams] -Little bit of a vis-- [high-pitched scream] Look at you! Twins. Nasty, fucking little twins. God! Oh, you're cruel! You're a cruel bastard sometimes! Ohhh! [laughs] Well... I think we have careers in show business for these two ladies right here. That'll be our first prize. I love women, man. I always have loved fucking women. [exhales] Sometimes it gets you in trouble, you know. It's like this Reagan thing with Reagan, the Iran deal. I know how it feels, I feel bad about this, guys. He fucked up, come on! You know, I've been caught in an affair before, it's no fun, you know? But... You figure after you admit it... You know, "All right, I did it. You know? Just let..." You know. Women are never satisfied with that. It's never enough to just go, "I cheated on you, I'm sorry." It's, "Did you fuck her? Did you fuck her?" How many times you heard that one, guys? You know, you go... "Yes. Yes, I did." You think that's the end of it. Then, like, a day later, it's like, "Did she suck your dick? Huh?! Tell me, you cheating son of a bitch! He was... You fucking primate! Did-- did-- did she let you fuck her in the ass?! Huh?! Is that it, she did all of it?!" That's the way America is, you know, it's like, it ain't enough, these guys went, "All right, we fucked up." [grunts] Rub their faces in it. "Come on, who has the money?! Where's the missing Iranian?!" You're like... I screwed up one time, really big in this town, a couple years ago. I had this girlfriend. And, uh, she was a real nice girl. I just came out of my second marriage, I'm seeing this girl, and, uh... I had about eight affairs on her one year. And, uh... And I felt really bad about it 'cause she was paying the rent. And I felt like a real male whore, you know? I felt like a real just... And, uh, I couldn't live with it anymore. It was tough, folks, I'm a comedian, I'm in show business. I'd be working at the club, you know. Women wait for you after the show, come up to you and go, "You know, I know you have a girlfriend, so we'll be real discreet. We'll, uh, go to my house, nobody will know about it, we'll get high, we'll light some incense, I'll light a couple of candles, and I'll give you head will you read aloud out of a book of 100-year-old erotic stories." You know, and you're going, "Yeah? Uh... Well, I'd like to go, but, uh, my girlfriend's on her period and she's home worried about the Cablevision bill. So I'm gonna go and be a sexual disappointment there. But, uh, thanks. Thanks for that exciting offer, but... I'm going to be a good boyfriend and go home." Yeah, sure, folks. Come on. Come on! I just got out of the ministry. I wanted to taste it all! Well, life, you know what I'm saying. Don't get... So I... I sat her down, I said, "Listen, I gotta tell you the truth. I've had, like, eight affairs on you in the last year and I feel real bad about it, and, um... I don't blame you for breaking up with me. If you wanna break up with me, break up with me. I wouldn't blame you." And I felt like such a fucking jerk, you know? She's crying... [high-pitched sobbing] "Don't go! Don't go!" You know? And I'm hearing this and I'm going, I can't believe this! This is love. This woman's gonna forgive me, it's gonna be better than it ever was, I'm gonna be a good man. This woman has convinced me love is real, people can forgive each other, and go on unaffected, man! I really got into it. I came home, I was the nicest guy, I didn't cheat anymore, I felt so good about myself. And in four months, this fucking vicious bitch... I didn't hear the last part when she was crying and said, "Don't go, 'cause I haven't got you back yet." I didn't hear that part. And, uh... So, um, you know, I'm Mr. Nice Guy, I'm buying this fucking bullshit. It's gonna be the same as it ever was. Yeah! She forgave me. I'm in New York, I gotta fly back to LA, I can just now talk about this. [laughs] Oh! I'm flying, this is two years ago. Oh, I remember the fucking day! I'm flying back from New York, it's two years ago, I did drugs then... [high-pitched squeal] Oh! Oh, they see through me! They see through me! [laughs] So I'm flying from New York. I'm trying to relax myself, 'cause I know it's gonna be five and half hours drive... flight, you know, so I'm higher than shit, you know? Smoked a couple of joints. I'm seeing Aztec temples and shit, you know. I'm on the ground at Newark Airport going, "Where's gate 56? Point me to gate 56." And this wonderful woman, she packed my luggage for me. And in my bag she packed a loaded .38. That's what this vicious, little fucking bitch... that forgave me and everything was gonna be the same... So I'm going through customs, you know, or whatever that x-ray thing. I walk through the box, I was going... I wait for my bag. All of a sudden I hear... [imitating alarm beeping] "He's got a gun! He's got a fucking gun!" So I'm turning around, I'm going, "I'm gonna see some real shit, man. Somebody's trying to smuggle a gun through here." I turn around, there's four officers going, "You wanna get your... you wanna step away from the luggage rack, please, sir? Step away from the luggage rack!" So I'm looking around, I'm going... [laughs] "No! That fucking whore!" Oh, yeah, she forgave me, yeah! Oh, I cheated on her a little bit, sure. One-night stands, nobody she knew. But I didn't have to go to federal prison for seven years so I can be some guy's roommate and put on a dress and shoes and dance! Man, women can be vicious, man. Oh, fuck! -[exhales] -[man] Oh, shit! [laughs] Oh, but I still love 'em. What are you gonna do? I still love women. But I learned one thing, guys: don't tell the truth. Don't tell the truth. Fuck the truth. The truth never kept anybody together ever! Lies keep you together. Lies enhance your relationship, they enhance your love. Get out of that bed every morning, go, "Still love you, honey! Oh, am I glad I got married! I wish I didn't have to work so I could stay here and fuck you all day! Gotta go!" I mean, lie, man, lie your ass off. "You're as pretty as when we met! [laughs] -Love ya!" -[cheering] You'll stay together for 50 years. You start doing that truth shit. Oh, man. Oh, it's the toughest, it's the worst. You don't wanna do that, folks. -[woman screams] -It's tough to make it work, relationships are a bitch. I don't know, I've had a share. Well, the first thing you gotta do is you gotta figure out what makes each other come. That's after the restaurants, "What kind of movies do you like?", "Who do you know in this town?", you know, all that shit. Gets down to what does it take to make each other come? You know... I think for, uh... I think for guys, I don't think we make it that tough, ladies. I don't think we make it that hard. It isn't like you need an instructional manual to work with us, we're pretty cooperative. I don't think we put up a lot of trouble. Just stick it in somewhere! Oh, ohhh! Ohhh! Oh, I love women. There's nothing else to do. There's no other alternative. I know, uh... You know, a lot of people say, "Sam, you're in Hollywood. What? A woman's broke your heart. Well, here, suck a dick. Go ahead, goddamn it, you've been hurt. You deserve it. Here... This Bud's for you, go ahead." Yeah, like that's the alternative. What?" Oh... [laughs] A woman's broke your heart? Well, where can I learn how to swallow a sword? [grunting] Yeah, it's a little tough for me, folks. I'm from the Midwest, I'm from that Bib-- I'm from one of the notches in the Bible Belt. [laughs] What a name, the Bible Belt. [laughs] I love those churches out there, man. [laughs] I saw one the other day, it says, "The church where everybody's somebody, but Jesus is Lord!" [laughs] Huh... I know they messed around with this guy's book. I read the Bible. I know they messed around with this guy's book. They did, man, the guy was under too much stress. You know? He could heal, that's a pain in the ass. The sick will find you wherever you go. If you can heal, you've got a new full-time job, folks. They'll find your ass. You can't take a piss. "Jesus! Are you in here? You got a minute to look at this?" Blind guys are coming in going, "Where is he, where is he?! Talk to me, pal. Where's the guy with the gift?" Like, "Yeah, I'll be right there. Can you hold on? Shit, I'm..." You got a minute, 5,000 people show up with no food. And he goes, "What? Huh? 5,000 of you? None of you brought a sandwich? No, let me get it!" Lepers will come up and go, "You know, the whole thing fell off, but they said you're the best. They said all you had to do was speak the word, it'll grow out. I came a long way." So you know this guy had those days, just like, "Oh, man, I see another leper I'm gonna throw up!" Trying to hang out. That's why I think the Last Supper, I know they doctored that up. Come on. You know? He was under the pressure, these guys are fucking confused, going, "Is it I? Am I the one that's gonna betray you? Am I the one..." "You guys gonna pay? Eat me! Here's your Last Supper! Sup on this! All right?!" So they're writing the Bible, going, "Oh! We can't write this. We can't say Jesus lost it at the Last Supper and told his disciples to eat him. He said, 'Eat me,' grabbed his dick and said, 'This is your Last Supper, sup on this.'" We can't write that. All right, wait, I know what we'll do. I know what we'll do, here we go. 'May you eat of my flesh, drink of my blood, or you have no life in you. Is that what we do, guys? Do you like that? Let's go with that. Let's say that he said, 'Eat of my flesh, drink of my blood, or he has no life in you.'" They doctored that book. [laughs] He didn't even know they were writing one. That's how secret this book was. I used to preach, I used to study the Bible. It's a pretty fascinating book. People go, "Sam, do you think you could do it again? Do you think... think you could ever be able to preach again? Do you think there's anything left inside you that has any good to it, that can shine a light into somebody's lost way! Do you think if you had to, if your soul was riding on the line, and you had to testify, and you had to make a commitment, if it was a final answer, what would you do?" -Well... -[cheering] What a rush! Whoo! Well, I don't know, I guess maybe... but, uh... [exhales] See how much energy that takes? Fuck... These guys don't do that anymore. Now they're smooth, you know. Now they have amusement parks and satellites. Lord told them to get a satellite. This guy didn't own a horse, but he wants them to have a satellite. [laughs] This guy... this guy had to walk at night because he didn't have a pair of shoes, and these fuckers are like... [imitates engine] [exhales] I don't know. Pat Robertson. "The Lord told me to run for president." Yeah, I bet he did. Well... [laughs] the Lord must want to make you look like a complete ass in the political arena, huh? [laughs] He's gonna have a fun night. He's gonna be driving home election night going, can't we just see it, "Yeah, great! Thanks for making me look like a fucking ass! Where's the nearest bar? I'm gonna beat somebody's kids! Get over here! I'm ready to live!" [roars] [laughs] Oh, is he gonna be pissed. [laughs] God's up in heaven, like... [laughs] "Yeah, I got bored. I got bored do I told Pat Robertson to run for president. [laughs] Watch this. Watch him do it. Watch him do it." -[chuckles] -[applause] He probably has a lot of fun. "Hey, tonight, tonight... tonight I'm gonna wake him up about three in the morning and have him take his tire pressure. Watch this. [laughs] Pat, it's the Lord. Yeah, I want you to go out and check your tire pressure. [laughs] Get out of bed, yeah... [laughs]" Yep. Guess the Lord likes to have a good laugh once in a while. [laughs] Jesus had a tough life, boy. I read about that guy. Jesus is the only guy that ever came back from the dead that didn't scare the fuck out of everybody, man. He's the only guy that ever crawled out of a grave where people didn't go, "Oh, ohhh! Oh, I just saw some fucker crawl out of his grave! I don't believe I'm seeing this shit! Did you see that? This guy just crawled out of his box, through the earth!" People are losing it, going, "Oh, ohhhh! Oh, the dead live! The dead..." [groaning] "Get a stake, put a stake in his ass! Cut off his head! Kill him again!" [groaning] Jesus comes back, he doesn't get any pressure. No static, nobody's upset. He climbs out, he's walking around, nobody's upset. They can eat with him and everything. You know? "Isn't that guy dead?" "Yeah, but he's real stubborn, man. He won't accept it." "Pass the butter. What are they staring at?" Ah... Yeah... yeah, I read that, folks, I read that book. He's on the cross. There's 30, 40 Christians standing around going... [sobbing] "It's a shame that he has to die." And Jesus is going, "Maybe I wouldn't have to if somebody would get a ladder and a pair of pliers!" [applause, cheering] A ladder, a pair of pliers, could have been a different book, folks. Little concentration, that's all, I tell you. But I read the resurrection story. If you ever have some chance, if you ever have the time, read this. What an amazing story. Guy's dead for three days, he comes back, you know. None of his friends shook up about it. He comes back with a holy message and shit. I'm reading this, and it's an exciting story, but I read it and thought, I know Jesus was never married. Guy never had a wife, no way. Was never married. 'Cause no wife would buy this story in 100 years. The disciples will, the believers will. No wife would buy this fucking story, good luck. Good luck with this story. First of all, he leaves on Friday afternoon with 12 other guys... -[cheering] -[laughs] He's gone for three days, no message, no way to get in touch with her. He comes home Monday afternoon looking like he hasn't slept. Looks like he's partied out, man. And Mrs. Jesus is just waiting on him. "Okay, I guess it's day three of this shit. All right. Oh, great... Well, I'm glad you could find your way home, savior! Where's your 12 friends who won't get a job? Where are they?! Yeah, disciples my ass. They're losers! Every one of them are using you. You're not smart enough to know that. Anybody says 'I believe,' we put them up and feed them. I'm sick of it. Where you been?!" Jesus is going, "I don't need this shit. Not after what I went through this weekend. [groans] No, honey, I'll tell you where I've been. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'll tell you where I been. First of all, not that it ruined your weekend any, but I was dead! Understand that, you fucking bitch?! I was dead! While you were sitting on your ass, I'm in a grave outside of town, out fighting death, hell, decomposure, I'm about to come in spiritual form and go in the kingdom of God and go, 'Wait a second! I better go back because she doesn't know where I've been!' So now I gotta fight the Angel of Death, get my fucking soul back, crawl out of a grave, come home to this shit, because I missed you, honey!" [cheering, applause] I don't know if Jesus has actually spoken in an audible voice to anybody in about 2,000 years. I think his last words may have been... "Oh, ohhh! Oh, not the other one! Oh, you jerks! Oh, oh!" That may have been his last words, I'm not sure. Yeah. People say, "You think Jesus is coming back?" Sure. Sure. What's it been? What's it been, 2,000 years? Boy, I sure don't wanna dampen anybody's optimism here. It's only 2,000 fucking years. Yeah, he's coming back. He's gonna do gameshows. They're gonna go, "Jesus, this is your life. -Remember this noise?" -[banging] "All right, don't tell me. Don't tell me. Give me a second." He's up in heaven right now going, "Why don't you go back down to Earth, be a symbol of peace and love to the world?" He's going, "Yeah. [laughs] Yeah. Sure. Hell, Pa, yeah. Yeah, I'd like to help. Tell them I'll be there as soon as I can play the piano again! Thanks a lot, I'm the only savior that can use his hand -as a fucking whistle!" -[whistles] People are going, "Man, aren't you afraid you, uh, aren't you afraid to tell jokes like that? Don't you have just a small chill that runs through your fucking blood when you tell a story, jokes like that?" No. No, folks, 'cause, uh, I'm not worried about hell. You go, "You think about going to hell?" No. No. 'Cause I was married for two fucking years! Hell would be like Club Med! Hell would be like a fucking resort, man! If you've been married, it ruins the devil's whole job. He's blown out, he's pissed off. You make him look like a Ronald McDonald, big feet, orange hair. You guys know, you're walking down the hall, you're going to hell, he sees you coming, he's like, "Yeah, here's somebody. Here's somebody I'm gonna scare the shit out of and torment, all right. [roaring] What? Oh, you been married? Let me take this shit off. Hold on. No, they didn't tell me. Uh... Come on in, I'll give you the tour anyway. There won't be any surprises here for you, but I'll show you around. Come on in. [exhales] See, over here is where we torment your soul. Whoa! Well, shit, man, if you've been married, you've been married, there's not very much I can scare you with down here. You've seen it... What? You've been married twice? [laughs] Would you like a job down here? Huh? 'Cause if you've been married twice, you qualify for our job employment program here in hell. We figure anyone who's been married twice can be a tour guide in hell. You can be a tour guide. You can take your own groups. 'Folks, stick with me, I've been married twice. I know this place pretty fucking well! And I won't lose you on this one, all right? Hold on.'" Marriage is tough. It's so fucking tough. I went through two of them, and if I get married again, I want a guy there with a drum set to do rim shots during the vows. "Do you promise to take her in sickness and in health?" "I sure do." [imitates rim shot] "Hey! Hey! [laughs] That's not nice. Who's doing that?" "Till death do you part." "Of course." -[rim shot] -"Hey! Hey, this isn't a vaudeville act. This is my marriage vows. Hey." [exhales] It's tough to stick together, I don't know. I respect people that can make it work, man. I've been through it a few times. I set myself up for it, I know that. I do. I get some really-- I go for the fucking women that are just gonna rip my heart out. I'm attracted to heartbreakers. I am. I love those women, you go up to them, they go, "Hi. Hi there, hi. Listen, is that your heart?" [roaring] That's my kind of girl. The ones that are really honest about it. You know? I like those. The girls who just tell you right up front, "I'm not gonna hurt you like the others. No! No, I'm gonna show you a whole new fucking level of emotional pain! They were amateurs, you're gonna beg for those bitches by the time I get through with you. First I'm gonna fuck all your friends. [laughs] Every single one of your friends, I'm gonna fuck 'em! [laughs] Guys you've known for ten years! Then I'm gonna leave you about $7,000, $8,000 in debt. And ruin your credit, get your phone disconnected. Just for kicks, I'm gonna talk you into giving me your car!" -[laughs] -[applause] Yeah, it's tough, man. God, it's tough. I imagine it's tough to be married in this town, especially Hollywood. Jesus. [whistles] 'Cause I tell you, if you wanna meet interesting women, if you wanna meet that neurotic ball of psychosis, psychotic bitch you've been waiting for your whole life, -this is the town. -[cheering] Psycho bitch headquarters of the entire world, right here, Hollywood, California. There's women that are going around, and they're two days away from having a fucking breakdown and they're just waiting for a new guy to come in their life that they can blame it on! [high-pitched laughter] Oh! I've been to parties, "Can I call you sometime?" "Sure, sure." "Here, why don't you call me. Here's my number." "Okay, thank you. Nice meeting you." You go home, "Why haven't you called?! You say you're gonna call somebody, you call them, you son of a bitch! I waited for you!" I said hi to you at a fucking party. They are out to fucking lunch here, man. They're just waiting for a guy that they can blame their whole fucked-up, miserable life on! You run into about ten of those. And there's no place better to do it than next door at the Rainbow Bar and Grill. Whoa! -[cheering] -[laughs] Where the possessed go to mingle. Yeah, where demons go to hang. "Hey, man, how are you? Ah!" I know, I should get... I should get the good kind of woman. I know that. I should get a woman that just gonna be there, be my friend, we'll be love mates, and partners, and... Women like that scare me. They're too good. They're really scary. Really, seriously, 'cause I've seen women that don't cheat, they don't flirt on you. They're... they're lovely, they're wonderful, they're faithful, they're committed. They're right there for you. But they do one sneaky fucking little thing. What they do is they put, like, five to seven pounds on a year. Nothing you notice immediately. Nothing you notice right off, boy. And then about nine or ten years, you realize you're living with their mom! Oh, ohhh! Oh, you fucking bitch! You tricked me! You didn't tell me you were gonna look like this, you fucking bitch! Oh, demon! The old five to seven pounds a year trick, man. [laughs] It's scary, ain't it? [exhales] What are you gonna do, give sheep the vote? What the fuck are you gonna do? There's no... You can't give sheep the vote. I tried. I thought maybe we could do it. We're Americans. We get some crazy shit done. I thought maybe we'd... we'd get on a fucking tangent on this sheep thing and... I thought maybe in 20 years, the sheep could be part of our culture. We could teach it to talk like us, give it the vote, find it places to live, find them jobs. Come on, we did it for the Vietnamese. [laughter, cheering] Ooh! [laughs] That's one of those jokes people go... [laughs loudly] "Goddamn it, we did it." I feel sorry for these Vietnam vets, man. That must be wild. Fifteen years ago, you're on the trail. [imitating gunfire] "Oh, God! Oh, fuck!" It's 15 years later now, these same guys gotta go, "Yeah, give me six dollars worth of unleaded on pump four. Yeah, you look familiar to me too, pal, all right? So... Good to see you over here. Glad you made the trip, motherfucker." This is couples night. A lot of fucking people together here. That's great. I'm not in a relationship right now. As you can tell. You can tell by this outfit. This isn't how you go. This isn't how you dress to go out and meet women. This is how you dress when you're waiting -for that school bell to ring. -[whistles] This is the "I'm waiting to give somebody a walk" look. And, uh... [laughs] But if you guys are in love, God bless you. Hope it's wonderful. Guys, show 'em more sexual attention. Make these women happy. I'm serious. -[women cheering] -Make 'em happy. Show 'em more sexual attention. Matter of fact, take the time that you're spending on them right now, sexually, the time that you're spending on them right now, take it and times it by two. Double the time you're spending with them sexually. Seriously. Be the-- fuck the shit out of them. Use their hair like the bridle of a horse. -[imitates horse whinnying] -[applause] So, uh... I know some guys are going, "Sam, we're a little awkward, a little backward. Is there something you can do to help us? Is there something you can tell us that will further us along in our sexual adventures with women?" Yes. Yeah, there is, guys. 'Cause I understand your plight. I do, because I tell you what. Sex education in this country really sucks for men. Men don't have sex, adequate sex education in America. -We don't. -[applause] Guys are on their own! [laughs] Oh... Mr. Hugh Hefner, ladies and gentlemen. The reason all of us have sexual fantasies. Thank God for him! Thank God for him! [laughs] Oh, this would have did-- this would have been a whole different world with you, pal, I'll tell you that. We'd all be learning how to make ashtrays and taking shop class seriously and shit like that, you know? We'd have been working on engines, "Hey, I got my arm..." [imitates engine revving] Oh... yeah, man. But basically guys in this country are on their own. Nobody helps us. Women have all kinds of information. Women have that little talk from Mom, they're about 12, and she goes, "Hi. You know there's gonna be a lot of biological changes coming up in your body. And, uh..." You know, they get a fucking gynecologist, they get all these pamphlets, the health classes, they're a lot more graphic about what they talk about in their sexual... Guys get dick! This is what guys get. We get dick, man! Nobody helps us! Guys in this country, when it comes to sex, are on their own! -Were we on our own, guys?! -[men] Yeah! Nobody helped us. I guarantee you, the first time every guy in this room, the very first time they had to lick pussy, they were on their own! -Was anybody there, guys?! -[men] No! No! We were on our own! We didn't know what we were doing. We were bluffing! We hoped it felt good! We hoped it was right! We didn't know! Nobody helps you figure this shit out. We didn't get any pamphlets from the fucking government. Mom and Dad are no fucking roadmap. What are you gonna do, ask them for sexual advice? Help yourself. Go, "Mom, Dad, you know, I met this girl and she's really special, and I really want to make an impression on her, so I was wondering, could you help me out, how do you lick pussy? Just give me some hints, give me some, uh... some I could use, and, yeah, sure, help yourself." Nobody helps you, man, you gotta figure this shit out on your own. Women won't help you. Women won't help you! Women won't give you a fucking clue. They enjoy your awkwardness. You can lick a woman's pussy the wrong way for five years, and she won't tell you. She won't tell you. No, she just lays there with that sexually frustrated look on her face, like... She won't tell you. She'll tell everybody else! She'll tell her mom, her girlfriends, her hairdresser, her little sisters, everybody else, man! "Well, he does not sense that. He doesn't know my needs. He doesn't know enough to shave and make his face smooth. He doesn't hold me after I come. [babbling]" But she won't tell you! That's why guys are on their own. That's why I try to help! 'Cause I've been through this, folks, I've learned the hard way. -Gentlemen... -[cheering] Gentlemen, I'm just trying to help, I swear to God. -[men shouting] -Just trying to help. Fucking A, man, trying to help. You go, "Sam, how can we do it? How can we do it?! If no one will help us..." Well, this is why I came back, guys. 'Cause most guys don't know what they're doing. They're awkward. We don't know. We have to be shown, ladies. You have to tell us. You have to show us. Most guys lick pussy like they're painting a fucking fence. They don't know what they're doing! They've got on stroke with it. The girl's going, "Jesus Christ! Am I being licked or weatherproofed?! Dang!" [applause, cheering] Which is why guys, I have a secret for you that will transform you tonight. You walk out of here tonight, not just your average person, you guys-- my dream, I'll just be honest, okay? Everybody has a dream. Mine isn't for world peace. Mine isn't that all people should live as one, that shit. Mine is that every guy walks out of here tonight knowing how to lick pussy better than he ever has -in his entire life. -[cheering] It's not a big dream! It's not a big dream. A small one, but I like to see every guy here walk out of these doors like an Oriental lick master from the Far East. Yeah... Say, "Sam, how can that happen? How is it possible?" Well, the next time you have a woman that you want to impress, you want to show her the most exciting sexual time of her life-- You wanna be the darkest chapter in her sexual diary. You have to make a statement about yourself, as a lover, she deserves 100 percent of your sexual creativity. What you do... is lick the alphabet. Just lick the alphabet. That's all you gotta do. Big capital letters, fucking-- It's an easy diagram to remember. Big capital letters, just go, "A! B! C!" She thinks you're from Europe or something. She's going, "Oh, God! Where did he learn that?! Oh!" You're going, "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K..." It works! It works. I know there's some doubters. I see the faces. I see guys, they go, "Sam, this alphabet thing has some humor to it. But I'm a pretty confident lover. I don't need this stuff. I have my own style." Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, let me make you a bet, okay? How about the next time you lick pussy, whether it's in three years, three months, or in three hours, the next time... you have to lick a woman, guess what little thought's gonna walk through your mind? Let me show you how the subliminal thought process works, guys. You're gonna be licking away and you're gonna hear the haunting theme... ♪ Now I know my ABCs [cheering] That's the haunting alphabet theme. "That's right, Sam Kinison. Goddamn it. The alphabet. I was doing the W and I didn't even know it! While I'm down here, why don't I write a letter to Santa!" [roaring] Yeah, shit. But what else you gonna do? I mean, I'm not gay. I don't wanna put the gay lifestyle down. Boop! They see through me again! I didn't pull it off! Oh, shit! [laughs] What am I supposed to do, folks? Pretend? Am I supposed to pretend I understand it? Then let's pretend. Let's pretend. I'm from Illinois. From the Midwest. [cheering] It's a little much for me to grasp, to take in. How does a guy look at another guy's hairy ass... and fall in love? How does that work? [cheering] Yes, I knew it would come along. They told me I was a fool to dream, that I was a fool to believe, but I knew, someday, I'd find a guy's smelly, hairy ass that was just for me. I've had a lot of guys' sweaty balls on my face, but this is love. This is love. [laughs] No, it's a guy's hairy ass. What am I supposed to do, pretend? And AIDS has really made it a popular sport, huh? If you did have any homosexual fantasies, fucking AIDS thing pretty much-- Put that fucking fire out, huh? "Well, you know, I was thinking about tasting a dick sometime in my life, but... Well, I don't know... [laughs] You bring in that high-risk factor, and, uh..." Yeah, it's always-- It wasn't like the gay community wasn't without social persecution before this disease. It isn't exactly like they were being greeted by veterans like, "Oh, there's one! God bless you, buddy! Keep up the fight!" It wasn't like they were being encouraged in their cause, you know? But... AIDS is really... [laughs] Oh, man. Thanks, guys. Thanks for giving us the black plague of the '80s! Thanks! Always nice to have to go to a public restroom and use your foot for everything. To fucking open the door... [crashing sound] You know. Flush the toilet. [imitates flushing sound] Turn on the sink. [squeaking sound] You know. -[cheering] -No hands, man. No fucking hands! I know I don't do enough-- I don't do my part on the AIDS research. Probably a lot of you guys don't either. It's tough. They're raising money. I should give more money than I do, but I just can't seem to find any at the end of the month. I sit around with that extra $30, $40 in my pocket and what do I want to do? Do I wanna help AIDS research, do I wanna give this... so they're gonna find a cure for AIDS, or keep Cablevision and all the movie channels? I gotta go with the fucking HBO. I've gotta go with fucking movie channels here. -Sorry, guys! -[cheering] You know, maybe if I had a second income, with a little more cash, but... I need my titty channels. All right, so, uh... [laughs] Yeah, it's tough. It's tough. I don't know how much this research money is actually getting to AIDS. I don't know. You know, these guys are researchers. You don't know what they're doing with that cash. We don't know. Come on. They have to cure everything. So they may be going, "You know, it's not like we're losing fucking military men here. Uh... May wanna push these bucks over towards lung cancer, muscular dystrophy research." "We're giving you the money. How come there's no cure? Jesus, will you hurry up! We're getting weak! I'm seeing dead relatives! Will you hurry up? Jesus!" People go, "Sam, where'd all this compassion come from, huh?" Mr. Nice Guy. [sighs] Well, I love women. If I don't, when I talk about that shit long enough, I fall in love with them again. Ah... Ah, there's nothing else to do. There's nothing else to do. Boy, I tell you some scary stuff, though. I read the darkest, sickest thing I've ever read in my life this summer. Check this out. This is dark. This is it. You go, "Sam, when do we hit the bottom of this interesting sense of humor of yours?" This is it. This is ground level, folks. This is the seventh level of granite rock, right here. We fucking touched it. I read the paper, they said that a group of homosexual necrophiliacs... had been going around to mortuaries offering them money to let them come in at night, spend a couple hours undisturbed with the freshest male corpse. [audience groaning] I wasn't trying to sell this as a fucking home game, all right? It's a story I read, folks. Jesus Christ. Give me a chance to do some journalistic reporting here. Will ya? I felt the same way! I read this thing and went, "Oh, ohh! Oh, thanks for the visual!" I felt sorry for these corpses, man. I mean, you think death would be bad enough, wouldn't you? I mean, the one thing that scares the shit out of everybody is death. You don't wanna think about it. You don't joke about it. You put it out of your mind. But you figure if you faced it, that's it. What could be worse than fucking death? You figure, I got past death... I mean, you hated it, but at least you lived through it. You know? You got by it and all that shit. I felt sorry for these corpses because I know these guys were laying out on slabs... They're on there going, "Well... well, life was tough and, uh... it was pretty hard to live up to. I have faced death, and I'm glad I went through it. And, uh, well, I'm ready to spend eternity in heaven, be with Jesus, and, uh, give a... Hey! Hey, what's this shit?! Oh, I don't believe this! There's a guy's dick in my ass! Oh, you mean life keeps fucking you in the ass even after you're dead?! It never ends, it never ends! Oh, ohhh! Oh!" [cheering, applause] [laughs] [exhales] [laughs] [coughs] People go, "Man, do you have to... do you have to do jokes about fucking the dead, man? It's pretty serious stuff." [laughs] Talk about something a little more socially relevant. No! Nope, I like to talk about things I know a little bit about, folks. And, uh... Not proud of everything I've done, but, uh... I know about fucking the dead. I do. I know what it's like to stick your dick in a corpse, I was married for two fucking years! I fucked the dead a lot, pal! I know what it's like! "Oh, move! Breathe! At least wrap your legs around me! Act like I'm inside you! Oh, ohhh!" [roaring] You guys have been great, I appreciate you coming out! [cheering, applause] We're gonna see you on the HBO special! Thank you! I love you! [Sam shouts] All right! [cheering, applause] Well, it's such a special night, and it's our last show, that I thought it was, uh, appropriate to do a love song. [playing soft melody] I wrote this about this girl that I met about five years ago. I was gonna come out with some money, you know, I've been trying to live out there for a while. And, uh... I met this girl and I wanted to impress her, you know, so we went through all my cash in about a year. Then one day she said, "You know, Sam, it's, uh... there's something missing from our relationship." I said, "That wouldn't be the cash, by any chance, would it, honey?" She said, "No, uh... we found so many special things about each other, I just... hate to see it all go to waste because the passion's gone." She says, "Can't we still see each other once a while, and, uh... have lunch or see a movie or... just to be friends?" I said, "Yeah, friends, I think I know what you mean. I become some kind of emotional tampon that you need four or five days a month. When no one else will take your fucking bullshit. But we don't fuck. Ain't that about right, honey? That's what 'friends' is, we don't fuck, right?" She said, "Well, yeah, that's kind of it." I wrote her this song, it goes like this. ♪ You fucking whore! ♪ You used me! ♪ You never loved me! ♪ I hope you slide under a gas truck ♪ ♪ And taste your own fucking blood! ♪ ♪ Die! Die! ♪ Die! I want my records back! ♪ ♪ I want my fucking records back! ♪ I appreciate you coming out, Hollywood! -I love you! Good night! -[cheering, applause] I love you! Ohhhh! [Marie] I'm very proud of Sam. And I know he's happy in what he's doing. -[cheering] -This makes me happy. I'm his mother. And I love him.
