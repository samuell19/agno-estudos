(INTENSE MUSIC) Hey guys, Coolduder here with another video. Ever since I did my video in my DVD room, talking about how it's haunted and that sometimes I see a ghost in here and all that kind of stuff, you guys have been bugging me again and again and again with videos requesting, since I must live in some sort of a haunted house or a haunted establishment or this room is haunted, or I have like a evil, haunted spirit bothering me or something like that, you guys continuously want me to do more haunted type videos. And one of the things I've been getting a request is a new challenge called The Bloody Nun Challenge. I don't really know if it's new, but I've been hearing about it now. It's like, it's one of those things where you go in front of the mirror and you say the name "Bloody Nun" three times and you're supposed to see the nun or something spooky supposed to happen. But it's a new big thing that you guys are continuously bugging me about. You know, I like doing my channel videos about DVDs and Blu-rays and reviewing them and talking about them. That's what I like, that's what I enjoy doing. But because of that damn video about my haunted DVD room, it's continuous now, you want more and more haunted type videos. So I have to do this damn Bloody Nun Challenge, at least to quiet you guys down for a little bit. You know, I'm sure absolutely nothing will happen. So maybe after that, you guys will leave me alone and let me, you know, and do my DVD and Blu-ray reviews. Even though I know this place is probably haunted after what I saw, I'm not really worried about it, it doesn't really matter to me because I like sitting here, sitting in front of the TV and just watching stuff, lounging around, that's what I do. Then I sit down on my couch and I review 'em and tell you guys about 'em. That's what I enjoy doing. I don't like doing haunted videos. I don't wanna go to a graveyard and do etches and etch out the names of the graveyard or do seances. I really do not like doing that. That's not fun to me, that's in no way exciting. So please stop asking, but to shut you all up, hopefully, you know, once and for all, for at least a little while I'm gonna do this stupid ass Bloody Nun Challenge. So I'm gonna head to the bathroom. Don't worry, you're not gonna see anything, I'm not showing anything in the bathroom, I'm just gonna stand in front of the mirror. If any of you were wondering about that stuff, I wouldn't be putting that up online anyway. And if I was gonna put it up online it would not be free. You'd have to pay for something like that. But I'm gonna head to the bathroom now and do this stupid ass challenge which just seems like a copy of other challenges that I've heard. But you guys want it. And you know, someone put this that, you know as a response to do it and you all keep thumbing it up and saying to do it and saying I don't do anything else besides the DVD and Blu-ray reviews. So I'm gonna do the Bloody Nun challenge. So let's head to the bathroom, do the stupid ass challenge and then please leave me alone, or come up with something else, you know, movie related 'cause I do not wanna do anything like this again. So let's just do this and then get it over it, okay. (DOOR THUDDING) All right guys, here we go at this stupid thing like I said, this is not the kind of thing, the thing that I do, these are not the kind of videos I do on this channel, this a movie related channel. And you all are really, really, really bugging me about this stupid shit to do, these stupid kind of videos. But like I said, maybe if I do this you'll leave me alone and quit talking to me and asking me to do stupid bullshit ghost stuff. So, okay, we're gonna do it, all right? So we're gonna do it and see what happens. And I'm sure absolutely nothing is gonna happen whatsoever. So let's just do it. All right. So I have to say this or I have to say the thing, I'm not gonna to say it till it's time to say it. All right. Bloody Nun. Bloody Nun. Bloody Nun. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (MAN GASPING) (LOUD SCREAMING) (CREEPY MUSIC) (INTENSE MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (ALCOHOL POURING) (PAPER RUSTLING) My name is Father Gordon Herschell. This is my written confession. I am recording this confession to prove that I have not been possessed by a demon. I had been a priest for 40 years. I am one of the top exorcists in the world. I have helped many people and cast out many demons. During my stay in Rome at the Vatican, I experienced something so evil, a nun, Sister Maria, she was overtaken and possessed by a demon. This demon feeds on the weak. It feeds on nuns who are weak and have doubts in their faith. This demon is called Valak. It is evil and powerful. It is attacking and taking hold of our sisters and using them to do evil and kill. One night as I left my quarters, I saw her walking and felt an evil presence in the air. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I approached her and she attacked me. (NUN GROWLING) I tried to pray with her and cast the demon out, it was too strong. She was going to kill me. I defended myself and I killed her. (NUN SCREAMING LOUDLY) (FLESH SQUELCHING) I hid the body and came back to America. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GORDON SIGHS) I heard of a story that happened in New York, a nun in a cabin murdering a group of kids. I feel it is too late. And this demon, Valak, is too powerful. I can feel her near. She is haunting me. I could not get that face out of my head. And I feel such guilt for killing Sister Maria. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I can't go on. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Father, forgive me. (GUN FIRES) (BLOOD SPURTING) (FLESH PLOPPING) (GENTLE MUSIC) Hello, Mateo. Hello to you as well, Father. You seem to have a lot on your mind tonight. Yes, do you? Sometimes thoughts can plague us, even torture us. Well, that's where we have to have faith to help our thoughts. And I taught you about faith, all's we need is a mustard seed that heals the sick. It's all we need. But you wanna know something, Mateo? I don't know where you're going with this, Father, but my guess is the devil? Well, I'm talking about big voluptuous tits, hot girls in thongs, sexy small boobs, long legs, tight clean pussies, I'd just love to lick one. Excuse me, Father, (SNIFFS) have you been drinking? Of course I've been drinking. - Why would you- - What is wrong? Well, what do you expect? I also have thoughts as well. You serve the Lord. I look to you for guidance. I've been serving the Lord for a long time and I've been listening to a lot of confessions. And I really need to tell you something, Mateo. Why, what is wrong? What is going on? I've also been jerking off after the confessions. We can't succumb to this. We promised to serve the Lord. Well, things have changed and we've lost parishioners. I don't know how many times to tell you this, I just feel like I'm losing my verve for this and I can't get these thoughts out of my head, whether they're dark or light. I understand these thoughts can trouble you. To be honest, they've been troubling me as well. But we have to do what we came here to do what you taught me to do, serve the Lord. Do you or do you not serve the Lord? Yes, I serve the Lord, but what makes me different, or you different than anyone else who serves the Lord? We still get those same thoughts. I get those same thoughts. Mine might be worse than yours. I don't know, Father. I can't answer these questions, but I look to you to show me the way and tonight your influence is doing more harm than good. Well, maybe you should start looking somewhere else. Like maybe we should go to the house. The house? I'm gonna tell you one thing I've heard in this confession recently, and it's about this house. There's this house that's filled with hot chicks, real sexy bodies, all kinds of things are going on there. Nobody will know if we go, we can just go and keep it quiet. At some point it has to stop. How are we gonna stop this? We're only human. And we have to get this cognitive dissonance out of our head, going against the thoughts that we're supposed to believe and be our true nature, and be like other humans. I carry a burden every single day but every day from morning to sunrise I just try to live in his image better. I try harder every day. And now I don't know, I'm starting to break, Father. Well, I'm starting to break too. So why don't we do this, let's just go to the house and have some fun. Nobody's gonna know about it. That's what we should do. I don't know. Mateo, we can go to this house and if you don't wanna go, I'm gonna go by myself. I wanna get laid. You may have lost your faith, Father, but I still have a chance to save souls. I've made my choice and that was a long time ago when I decided to come here. I wanna go hook up with some hot chicks. I'm going back to my quarters. You have a good night. I'll pray for you. (GENTLE MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello, Gabriel. I've been waiting for you. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Remove the cross. (GABRIEL GROANING) Come to me. I know you want this. I know what you do at night. I know about the cross stressing and I like it. Come to me. Accept this amulet. Come to the dark side. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GABRIEL GROANING) (DISTORTED VOICES) (GABRIEL SCREAMING) (DISTORTED VOICES) (GABRIEL ROARING) (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (GENTLE MUSIC) Miss, have you seen Father Gabriel? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Excuse me, miss. Are you lost? Is there something wrong? (OMINOUS MUSIC) I don't recognize you. You're not one of the sisters here. Have you seen Father Gabriel? Father Gabriel? Don't worry about Father Gabriel. Father Gabriel, have you seen him? He's not here. But you're restless. Do you like it? Father Gabriel was a weaker man. You're a strong man. - Would you like to see- - Strong man that serves the Lord. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (NUN CHUCKLING) - I can't. - I think you like this. - I can't, I can't. - I think you like me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do this. Is this a joke? You're making me really uncomfortable. Can I help with something? Are you lost? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Here. Come taste. That's it. You know you want to. All for you. (OMINOUS MUSIC) No, I can't! (NUN ROARING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello, kind sir. And who are you? Would you care for some forbidden fruit? You won't tempt me. I know you're a demon. And I know all about you, demon hunter. But there are many of us and we will not all be killed. Oh yes you will. It'll just be one at a time. (INTENSE MUSIC) (NUN GROWLING) (NUN SHRIEKING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello, Father. How are you doing today, sir? Is there something I can help you with? Actually, there's something I can help you with. The Lord is my shepherd and my guiding light. But what is it you can help me with? I can keep you from not only losing your faith, but losing your soul. My faith has been challenged lately but what do you know of it? I know. I saw the woman. Who's that woman? Nevermind who that woman is. She's been taken care of. I see that she challenged your faith though. MATEO: Most certainly did. You're only half a priest right now, Father. MATEO: I try my best. After you still had your faith, the other half just doesn't know. MATEO: How do you know all this about me? I've been around a long time. I know a lot about everything. So what do you plan on doing about it? I'll admit my faith has been challenged but I'll do everything in my power to save as many as I can. SANDOVAL: Going to that house is not gonna save your faith. You just wouldn't understand. You just wanna go there and watch people get jackrabbit fucked booty clapped, right? Slapping that flesh. That's what you're going there for, all right. But guess what? You may not leave there alive with or without your soul, and I've been doing this a long, long time, priest, and I've been real good at it. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I'll do what I have to do. I appreciate your concern, but I will also do what must be done. You've been warned, Father. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (INTENSE MUSIC) (WHIRRING) (SANDOVAL GROANS) May the Lord be with you. (INTENSE MUSIC) (WHIRRING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Sandoval! Sandoval! Faith, what are you doing here? Ah, I'm going with you. Not on this one, I'm sorry. Oh my God, you trained me. You told me how to kill. You need me. And that's all well and good. But this demon is not like any other. He's an old demon, many tricks. You're not up to this and I don't want anything to happen to you. And I can't do battle with him if I have to worry about you. I had a vision, Sandoval. I had a vision that you fucking died! So please take me with you! Listen to me, I'm not gonna die. I'll be fine. I'll be back. Your body is weak. Please, take me with you. My body wasn't too weak last night, was it? Was it? Oh, I know it was actually the best I've ever had, - and oh my God. - Listen to me, all this time, working with you I just never realized how beautiful you are. And I don't want anything to happen to you. I couldn't stand it. So you're staying here. You promise me you'll be safe? Hey, Faith, have a little faith. Trust me. You go back to my place, make yourself comfortable. And when I get back, I'll tell you all the war stories. Here, take this with you. It's blessed. You're gonna need it. Even if I don't need it, at least I'll have a piece of you with me. Stay safe, my love. (OMINOUS MUSIC) What the fuck? (OMINOUS MUSIC) (INTENSE MUSIC) This is nice.

(DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC) (PUMP CLACKS) (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) Not supposed to be sitting around. I don't know who sent you, come into my house to enjoy my women, but you don't spend any money. Do you? Mr. Draven, you have a very receptive mind. Hmm. The fact that I'm kind of ordained to be here. Kind of like the priest in the corner. I'm here on a mission. A long, long time mission. - A mission, you say? - Mm-hmm. You see, you can appreciate this. I'm a hunter. Mm-hmm. And my prey is in your midst. Ah. In my midst, aye? And what is it, Mr. Sandoval, that you hunt? I hunt demons. In fact, I was set to hunt one particular demon, a nun, but much to my chagrin, I come to find that there are two demons here. Oh, is that correct? So I can basically kill two with one stone, so to speak. Well, that would explain why you came here. Yes. And as for my future, I don't care how it ends up for me. My job will be accomplished. 120 years, I've been doing this, Mr. Draven. I've gotten quite good at. I see. 120 years, Mr. Sandoval, and apparently you're not very good at, are you? And how so? Well, it's taking you all this time to locate your demons. But yet they still walk the earth. - That is true. - Hmm. Imagine my surprise when the person hosting the demon, is a demon himself. (DRAVEN LAUGHING) Mr, Sandoval, you accuse me of being one of your demons? I am not accusing you, Mr. Draven. I am telling you fact. And I'm looking at you straight in the eye as I say it. And I gotta say, here's the thing. Whether I make it out of here alive or not, I have this safe bet before I entered these premises. Mm. The difference is when the end comes, I go up there, you go nowhere. No, Mr. Sandoval. (LAUGHING) You have quite an outlook on what's going on here and yet I find you so full of shit. Well, say what you want but in the end, shit rolls downhill, pal. (INTENSE MUSIC) 10 favorite horror movies. I mean, I just hate horror movies - "Scream" - because the black guy always dies I the end. - That's true, man. - That is true. They're always the first one to go. That's true, I never even thought about that, but you're right. MALDITO: What are you still doing here, holmes? (ALL LAUGHING) You know what I mean? It's either the black guy or the guy in the wheelchair that always dies. - Oh, God. - Oh, man. I like the chupacabra movie. - Chupacabra? - Chupacabra? Where are you, man? Mexico. No, we're in the United, oh my God! Mr. Cool has left the room. That sounds like a good scary movie. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm glad to see my guests all enjoying themselves. It's a wonderful night for scary stories, isn't it? But if you want to know what scares me, I would have to go back to my childhood, when out for a drive with my family. The car skidded off the road, turned over, and I was ejected into weeds. I had to lay there and listen to my father, who was trapped behind the steering wheel, screaming my name. I was the only one there who could help. And yet, I was frozen with fear. (OMINOUS MUSIC) And while I lay there frozen in fear, I had to watch my... They burst into flames. My poor mother's face melting in the window. As my father screamed for help, I was the only one who could open the door, but I could not move. My friends, if you want to know fear, experience immobilization. (OMINOUS MUSIC) That, my friends, is fear, when you cannot do anything about what is causing your fear. But here I stand today, I've gotten through it. Unlike my family. The only good I can see that's come from that, though, is that I never took up smoking. Well that, Mr. Draven, is a riveting story. (ALL APPLAUDING) Better than a chupacabra. - Mm. - Yes. Enjoy yourselves. - Have a good time. - Mm, we will. (TIFFANY LAUGHING) (INTENSE MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) Oh, check out this cool new pimpin' shirt on me. It looks swazy, yo. The hell with them. Here's us. I'll drink to that one. All right.

(INTENSE MUSIC) (DRAVEN ROARING) (FAITH SCREAMING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of "Ella's Paranormal Investigations." Now today, we will be interviewing a gentleman by the name of Hunk. He survived the demon nun massacre, and he wrote a book about it too. Some say he's making this entire thing up. So naturally, I want you to give him the opportunity to tell his side of the story so we can find out the truth once and for all. Let's go to the interview now. Hello Hunk, welcome to the show. My name is Hugh Edwards. I'm a journalist and author. My friends call me Hunk. You're not my friend, Ella. Okay. So let's get straight into this. I really, really wanted to get you on the show so that you could basically tell your side of the story. So many people have just completely debunked your side of things. And basically Cluster was insane. Insane? Insane? How can I be insane when I saw that demon and battled it with my own eyes and body. That thing, put a hook, a meat hook through my shoulder. I had a battle with that thing and you're calling me crazy? Okay. Don't get aggressive with me, mate. I will end this interview if I have to. I'm sorry, but in order for you to listen to me and really understand me, I have to tell you and show you what I went through in that cabin. Yes, but there is no evidence supporting your claims. Not one body found. No nun, no dead vloggers, no millionaire. Yeah, it's strange that Paranormal Tim and the Ghost Boys went missing after your claims, but still nothing to support your story. People leave social media and their video vlogs all the time. No supporting evidence. Is that in your question, Ella? Well Let me tell you something. Paranormal Tim got a hook right through his crotch. I saw it. I was there. The Ghost Boys, they turned into fucking demons and unfortunately I had to kill them with a hammer. I'd crack their skulls open, and well, Shiva, that guy's responsible for the whole thing. He had some kind of amulet that controlled the nun and summoned this thing from hell. That thing tried to kill me and my friends. Hmm, okay. So you were also tied to Becky E. right? Another paranormal investigator like myself. She has also been off the grid. Hunk, do you know if her whereabouts? No, I don't know the whereabouts of my girlfriend, Becky E. Yes, YouTube blogger, Becky E. She had the amulet and something happened to her. It changed her, her and Rico. Do you mean Rico Vega? The drug addict who was making up fake hauntings to take people's money? Yeah, it's Rico Vega. He's my friend, Rico. He's a good guy. I used to think the same thing about him, but the man saved my life that night. So I would do anything to save his. Listen. Becky. Please baby, if you're out there, listen to me. You know I love you and I miss you. And I will find you. If anybody in your audience or anybody has any information about Becky, you know how to contact me. Well, I think we all know about Becky's troubled history and making up some videos with her buddy, Rico. But I really want to focus on you, Hunk. I want to believe your story. And I think our viewers will agree that it is such a good story. You said you were Becky's cameraman that night. So why don't you have any video footage of what happened? Well you know, that's actually where you're wrong. I do have footage to show you and your audience. You wanna know about the nun? I'll show you. (STATIC BUZZING) Oh. Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) (SIGHS) (INTENSE MUSIC) Hunk, can you please stop the video? (INTENSE MUSIC) Hunk, can you please stop the video? I can't watch anymore. And we're also live. (INTENSE MUSIC) The bloody nun is real. I told you. I told you all the nun is still out there. Becky, I love you, baby. I'm coming to get you. But you all have to listen me now. The nun is still out there! I thought I destroyed it, but she is still out there! (SIGHS) The nun is back. I'm coming for you. (STATIC BUZZING) (INTENSE MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (NUN SNARLING) (INTENSE MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (MANIACAL LAUGHING)
