Make a line, ho. - Welcome Se?or, may we remove the gun? - Certainly sergeant, you may. Ok. Captain Francisco Ramirez at your order sir. My general's compliments sir. - And mine to him sir. Lee Arnold. - Hurry up, we haven't got all day. My pleasure Mr. Arnold. - Your health. - And yours. Ten guns, my captain. - Prepare to move out. - 20,000 pesos, in gold. We need every gun we can get against this Villa. - Really fights that well? - He's a terrible fighter. That's the trouble with him. Pancho Villa, crawls out from under his rock... shoots you in the back, robs you and then runs and hides again. He's a menace to Mexico, believe me. Captain, group is all ready sir. You suppose I could borrow a couple of your men to get... the wheel back on my plane? I'd like to be able to take off. My regrets Mr. Arnold... but my general has ordered me to return with these guns as soon as possible. First village south of us is Chupadero, they have an excellent blacksmith. He forged Caisson underpinnings for Villa, so I'm sure he can help you. My regrets Mr. Arnold but it's the best I can offer. - I'll take it. - One other thing. The villagers, they're what we call Pacificos. They don't fight for him but they're sympathetic to Villa. It would be wise not to tell them why you were here. Group, forward, march. They won't hurt you Mr. Arnold. Just don't stay too long, that's all. So, fix your airplane, come back and fly for us, much more money. This is Mr. Arnold, he's a gringo from El Paso. He flies in the air and I taking him to the blacksmith. He's a gringo from El Paso. Fina, I am taking him to see your father. And I am taking him to the blacksmith. This is Mr. Arnold, he's a gringo from El Paso and I am taking him to the blacksmith. I am the blacksmith. - Mr. Arnold, this is Luis Gonzales. - How do you do? Move, hey, hey. Hey, get away from there, you want it to bite you? You've never seen an airplane before? What do you think? Oh, I am sorry Se?or Arnold, but nothing more can be done till tomorrow. But this isn't exactly my airplane. You see, I just borrowed it, kind of, and if I don't get it back... Se?or Arnold, do not worry. You may not be at home but tonight you will be in your own house, come. - But he'll come looking... - Come, come, come, come. - Something displeases you Mr. Arnold? - Oh no, everything is fine. Thank you very much, just great. - Coffee Mr. Arnold? - Please. Fina, coffee. Cigarette. - Allow me. - Oh no. - Thank you very much. - Juanito? It's alright. You know Mr. Arnold, it's too bad you didn't have engine trouble a little earlier. You missed a great moment in the life of our village. - Oh? - Pancho Villa came here today. Well, I don't know much about him, you know, from the states he's just known as a bandit. No, no, Pancho Villa is no longer a bandit. - He's not? - No. No, no, no, no. He, he is fighting for the revolution. The Colorados, they are trying to destroy the revolution. They are trying to take away our President Madero. - That's typical of the Colorados. - You are a wise man Mr. Arnold. Believe me, if you ever see soldiers under a red flag, ride the other way. The Colorados are the cruelest men in Mexico. - It's good? - Very good. Juanito, wake up. Look. Isn't that my shirt, floating down the river? - Must be, those are my pants. - But don't just sit here, go and get them. What do you expect to wear tomorrow, weeds? Pull, burro, pull. Pull. It worked. Yes, it worked, good, eh? - Good? It's better than good, it's the best. - Ay, compadre. - How can I pay you? - Nothing. You are my friend, you are my guest. Now, where I come from... When you're a guest, you have to bring a house gift. That's the way, so... for the house. Mr. Arnold, this is your house always. I believe I like that. - Troop forward. - Forward. Colorados. Stay upstairs, lock the door behind you. Colorados. Juan, no, no. Listen... I know what I have done for Villa. One of us must die but not both, not yet. You understand me? You promise your father. Now hurry, run. Hurry. They say that you embraced the bandit Villa. For Captain Ramirez, is there no embrace for him? Not so nice, I warned you not to stay too long, didn't I? Almost very lucky but you still have to do it my way, take him too. Wait. Alright, women out. No, no. I don't have time to fool with you. Maybe I, maybe I do have time. No, no, no. No. Bring them over here, the prisoners. Bring them over here. Wait a minute, just a damn minute soldier. Come on, all of you, into the square. Move, move. Too many guns. Tell it to Villa. Alright, you stupid people. Now we going to teach you a lesson. You don't listen, the trouble with you. You're all asleep, your mind is somewhere else, you don't listen. So you got to learn the hard way. With your permission, my chief. The Colorado captain is hanging everybody, we don't move soon, there will be no one left. Not yet. You think your President Madero is such a great man. All for the peons, he's not for you. - We're for you. - No. I tell you, President Madero is a coward. A coward who accepts the support of a thief and a murdering bandit Pancho Villa. He's afraid not to. Why isn't your hero here to help you now? I'll tell you why. Because he's off robbing other peons, that's why. They're both robbing you, you stupid people. Why do you like people who rob you? These men up here, you know what they are, don't you? They're traitors, they do favors for Pancho Villa. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Now. Hold it. Put Luis Gonzales on my horse. - Urbina. - My chief? Post sentries. Excuse me my chief, what should we do with the officers? The officers? Hang them. The Colorado Captain Ramirez. The chief sends me to say your husband is in the church. The chief sends me to say he grieves with you for your husband. And that your husband was a great heart. I say this for myself too Se?ora Gonzales. - You, gringo. - Who? Me? You see any other gringos around here? - Urbina. - My chief. Read me what the guns say. Property of Munitions Company of... El Paso. You know... I think somebody is been running guns to our enemies. - Gringo guns. - I think so. Hey gringo. You haven't seen a... Gun running son of a bitch gringo around here, have you? Say something gringo. - What can I say? - Whatever is in your heart. Raise your hands. This is your heart. Urbina. - My chief? - Put him with the Colorados. Please. Quiet. - I am going to shoot you. - No. Let me explain things, you see this wall? If you run real fast and climb over this wall, you can go free. Don't worry too much because I am a very bad shot. Why are you nervous? You think I'm going to shoot you? - But you wouldn't want that Chief. - If one Colorado gets over that wall... because I don't have a loaded gun in my hand, I will shoot you. Yes Chief. Three. No, no. - Five this time. - No, no, no, no. No. No, not me, no. - Five more. - No, no, no, no. Chief, Chief. Run. Walk then. Wait Fierro. You know that airplane? Could tell us where the Colorados are before the Colorados know where we are. That's right and I'm the only one who can fly that airplane. It can be very useful to you, very useful. Fierro? - You think the gringo wants to fly for us? - I'll fly for you. I hope he can fly better than he can walk. - I'll fly for you but I want something. - What? - I want to blow his brains out. - I don't think he'll let you do that. - Well, let these men go. - Alright. - How many? - How? All of them. Their officers are dead, they can't hurt you, they don't want to fight anymore. No, just one. - One? - One. Pick him. Go on gringo, it's your chance to save one life. Go ahead. - You pick him. - Let one go. Urbina, a horse for the gringo. Five more. You know, you amaze me, gringo. You're around guns and you don't care who gets killed... so long as you get paid and you don't have to watch. Must be a terrible thing to kill a man without hating them. Clear, clear. Put it on the table. - Urbina. - - Yes, my chief? - Get me some wire out of that piano. - Yes, immediately, my chief. Hey. Where you going? I've been told the villagers, they will fight with you now. - The women? - - The women, they will follow the men. You see? Bring this outside, I'll get the mount ready. Yes Chief. - What did he mean you see? - Well, it is like this. The chief let the Colorados have their way with... the villagers for a while before we attacked. You mean to say he was here in time to prevent it? Well, it is like this. The villagers, they love my chief and they love Mexico. But they didn't hate our enemies enough to fight. And now they do. Pablo, Miguel, Antonio, out. I swear. Ever since we've been fighting, my horse gets more than I do. Your horse has more to offer than you do. Just a damn minute. Let her go. Ah, what the hell? You go outside and die, where are your manners? What happened? That one with a foul mouth wanted her for his woman. So? She didn't want him, I took care. I'll tell you what happened. While you were teaching the villagers to hate this afternoon... she was being raped by Captain Ramirez. So she doesn't want any man tonight. It may just be possible that she feels that no decent man wants her. It wasn't just that soldier, you know. It was you too, you're responsible. You might just as well have raped her yourself. Urbina? - Get a priest. - What priest? - Any priest, just get one. - And so, my children... I pronounce you man and wife. Urbina and Fierro, let's fix the cannon. - Good morning. - Not good. What? I said not good. What's the matter with you? Don't you understand the language of men? Not good. Having a little trouble with the wife? This is my wife and my mistress. And don't you forget it gringo. - Plane ready? - Plane is ready. Is he always like that in the morning? My chief received a telegram, he is not to attack Parral. General Huerta is to attack Parral. But aren't they both fighting for Madero? Villa fights for Madero and Mexico. Huerta, I think, fights for Huerta. Wait. - Fierro is going with you. - What? Now wait a minute Chief, not with... Chief, it's tough enough up there as it is. Now you go up there alone, you could fly away. You try that with Fierro, Fierro will shoot you. And without a pilot, what's Fierro going to do? Fierro will shoot you. Fierro. Fierro, you go with him. No. Fierro... - What do you mean no? - I mean no. No. - Well why not? - Because... because I don't think he is a good pilot. - You're probably right, it doesn't matter. - No? If he's no good, you shoot him and fly it yourself. Me? Why, any child could learn how to fly one of these things. - Ah, you think so. - Yes. - You could fly this? - Of course. Then fly it. Have you lost your mind? You can't fly this thing. - You teach me, now. - Chief... it takes years to learn how to fly an airplane, you probably... You'll crack up before you get it off the ground. You better hope I don't. This machine is all that keeps you alive. Teach good. That's fine. Now we're not worried about the magneto anymore Chief... now we're looking at the altimeter. - The what? - Altimeter. - Altimeter. - That's right. Altimeter, right. Hurry. I'll tell you what Chief, let's try the whole thing one more time... - Now, gringo. - Right. Alright, magneto set? Yeah. Viva Villa. Viva Villa. Don't do this, I don't like it. I will shoot you. This is Parral and... This is Parral. This is where we are. And right here... There's a troop train full of troops coming toward us. - Who cooked this? - Me Chief. - No, you didn't. - No, I didn't. - Cook it. - Yeah Chief. This is Parral, this is us, the train... Headed north? Yet the Colorados know that Huerta... is south. Now they have to hold Parral to control all the supply lines. Yet they send a train full of troops on a ride... not south toward Huerta but north toward us. Worries me. - They are not afraid of Huerta. - Worries me. My orders say don't attack Parral, leave it to Huerta. Huerta has an army in front of Parral, yet he won't make a move to take it. The orders don't say you can't take the train. 400 Colorados. You're right Chief, that's too many. Too many? Not with your help. My help? No, no Chief. I've done my job, it's all up to you from now on. Rawhide, pieces of iron, dynamite. We light them, throw them at the enemy, baroom. You're going to drop them on the Colorados, from the air. No, no, no Chief, now, let me explain something to you. An airplane is not used for fighting. It's just to determine the size and the strength of the enemy. - Who said? - Well, it just isn't done Chief. Why not? Well, in the first place, you got to light those things in the air in an open cockpit. Smoke cigars. Well, even if you could do that, they'd explode long before they hit the ground. There's nothing you can do about that Chief. Yes there is, fly low. Chief, I said I'd fly, not fight. - What's the difference? - About 20,000 dollars. In order to do that, I got to fly her real low, they could knock me down with a rock. That's a pretty expensive airplane. Why you argue with him? It's always a question of money with you, isn't it, gringo? I'm just like you Chief, first the bandit and then later, when I... become a big enough bandit, they might call me a hero. An idealist, just like you. - You'll get paid. - How much? 25 pesos for every Colorado you kill. - Pretty cheap. - Look gringo, this is a cheap war. Next year I'll have more money, we'll have a bigger war, alright? Ok. All clear, come on. Open fire, r?pido. R?pido. Viva Mexico. Juanito. You, you and you, over here. Line up. Go like this. Good, good, very good. It works, three more. - Now, we can take Parral. - But Chief, with your permission... didn't General Huerta say not to attack Parral? Not to attack Parral, he didn't say I couldn't go there. Send a message to the headquarters in Parral. We are under heavy attack by Pancho Villa. Request permission to return at once. Signed, Jose Ochoa, Major commanding. You saw what his plane can do. I want you to make friends with him. His mother should've sat on him when he was born. I don't like him. - Do I like Huerta? - No. But he's helping me win the war, I think. Hey Fierro, I'm not asking you to marry him. Just make him happy. - We don't need him. - No? No, you could fly the plane. Me? Sure, any child could fly it. I will do what you say. Jorge. - Yeah Chief? - Who cooked this? - Me Chief. - No, you didn't. - No, I didn't. - Cook it. Hello gringo. For you, Villa says you did very well. Is something wrong? Isn't this what you fight for? Well, I don't fight for fun. Maybe you think it's not real. Look. It's real, very real my friend. I may be a lot of things but I don't really believe I'm your friend. I'm trying to like you gringo. - Stop for inspection. - Inspect your mother. Switch us to the station immediately Lieutenant. I'll switch you nowhere, my orders are to inspect. Do that first Pancho Villa will be shooting furrows up and down your spine. - Pancho Villa? - Pancho Villa. - Viva Villa. - Viva Villa. - Viva Villa. - Viva Villa. Villa has taken Parral. He didn't attack, he didn't fire a single shot. The city fell into his arms, like a woman. Why you look so unhappy major? This is a great victory for our country. For President Madero., for the revolution. - Is it not? - Yes, my general. Then look happy. Colonel, detach your troop transport cars. I want to be in Parral as soon as possible. - But, General Huertas... - Yes? With your permission, isn't it dangerous to face Villa without your army? You think it's less dangerous to face Villa with my army? The one predictable thing about Pancho Villa is that he will obey President Madero. And I hold orders from Madero. Yes, my general. - Gringo, get the money? - I got it, yeah. Don't go gringo, don't go. Stay with me. You fought well today. What is your name se?orita? - My name is Emilita my general. - Emilita? Emilita and Pancho, sounds beautiful. - Think about it. - Chief? - You know I think I'm in love with you? - Chief. - But I have a man my general. - You're married? - No. - Hey Chief. Then it must be that he doesn't love you very much. But I love you and I will marry you. Urbina, get a priest. See gringo, all women want to get married, no matter what they say, right? Now, you know and I know, that these marriages don't mean a thing. - I didn't know. - But it makes them happy. It's the eleventh time for me, I think. The only thing I want to do is make them happy, there's no harm in that. And so now, my children, I pronounce you man and wife. Viva Villa. Viva Villa. You really got to hand it to that fellow though. Yes sir, you've really got to hand it to him. Hand him what? Pancho Villa is a bandit, a bigamist and a barbarian. It takes more than dumb luck to turn that into a national hero. A chili picker is got brains. I may have stepped in a manure pile, but I just might come up with the golden horseshoe. One of these days, that man is going to own this country. - He doesn't want to own the country. - He doesn't? No, he wants the people to own it. After all you've been through, you still believe that he's for the people? - He's a good man. - About me? Am I a good man too? Yes. Well, I'll tell you one thing honey. I'm as good a man as Villa and that's not saying a hell of a lot for either one of us. I don't care what you are. - This is an outrage. - This is an outrage. - Why? - Tell him to stand up. Stand up when you address the general, damn you. I am General Huerta, of Madero's Republican army. - Get Colonel Villa. - Who? Colonel Francisco Villa, he is to turn Parral over to me. By order of President Madero, you understand? Now where is Villa? Get him. He's not here, I will find him for you though. But I warn you he's very hard to find. I will try. Come on, you taking me to Madero. - What? - Hurry up, get your pants on. - How? - Well first one leg, then the other. - Where is Madero? - Mexico City. - Mexico? What about the gasoline? - Don't worry about the gasoline. - Where is he? - In the anteroom, my president. Excuse me. Pancho my friend, congratulations. Wonderful, wonderful. - Have you eaten, are you hungry? - No, thank you my president, I'll eat later. Come with me. Well, what is it? - Don't make me do it. - Do what? Don't make me give Parral to General Huerta. Pancho, this is dangerous. - What is dangerous? - Your conflict with Huerta. How can I have a conflict with him? I haven't even see the man. Nor did anyone else in Parral, until after I took the city. Then he came. Came? Pancho please don't misunderstand me. I'm happy you're here, very happy but... You have just created a terrible problem. - Oh, you don't want Parral? - Of course I do. But when Huerta finds out that you've come directly to me... He will think that you and I are plotting behind his back. - And that's dangerous. - Who the hell is Huerta anyway? Did he win Parral? No. He's no good, drinks. He's not for you, just for himself. Don't put me under his command. General Huerta is head of the Republican army, what else can I do? I gave him my word. What about your word to me? Don't you owe me something? - I took Parral for you, not Huerta. - No nation can have two armies. Under Huerta, one army is one too many. What is it that you have against Huerta? I don't think he's loyal to you. You personally know that General Huerta plans to overthrow the revolution? No, my president. Has anyone indicated to you even by rumor that he has such plans? - No, my president. - Then what? Come on, come on, come on, speak up. Get out of here, get back to your people. - Facts, I want facts. - Get out of this fancy palace. - Give me proof. - I cannot give you proof but I know. I can smell it, I know. Pancho, do you think that... That I'm betraying the revolution? No, but... How can you trust Huerta and not me? You are my president. I ask you only one thing, don't trust him. Everyone is not like you. My friend, it's very much better that I die a fool trusting too much... then live a tyrant, trusting no one at all. Mexico is had enough of those. Oh Pancho, this is just like the old days. Once again, I'm asking for your help. It's essential to me to have your promise... that you'll obey General Huerta as you obey me. You're too good. That's neither here nor there, have I your promise? Yes, my president, I promise. And so gentlemen, tomorrow at first light, we will initiate our attack on Conejos. You Colonel Villa, will have the honor of leading your forces on the primary assault. Major Ebanias will hold the right wing, Major Escobar, the left. This is the last Colorado stronghold in the north... and I want you to understand I will not tolerate one step backward. Is anyone ever known me to take a step backward? Colonel Villa, there are other officers in this room besides yourself. Or don't you think so? Now, since you're leading the attack... don't you think it advisable to get underway immediately Colonel Villa? No. No? No, if I ride in daylight, the dust will give me away. The enemy will know I'm coming, I should ride at night. My dear colonel, you... you are laying siege to the town, not robbing it. You will leave immediately. Gentlemen, I fully expect Colonel Villa's forces to do their duty... to the last man. Do I make myself clear? Fire. Barbed wire. Barbed wire. - Let's go. - Go? Where? Can't you see? Villa is going to be overrun. Of course he is, there's nothing we can do about it. Look at that city, it's suicide flying over those guns. You can shoot me if you want to. I'm not going any place. Not till we get some support from our own guns. You wait here gringo, for me. Retreat, retreat. - Colorados are lining up the charge. - Why aren't you flying with the gringo? He tells me it's suicide unless we get artillery support, I think so too. What are they waiting for? Why don't they give me artillery support? That stupid artillery officer says that he's got orders to wait for you to counterattack. Huerta. Huerta is waiting for me to be overrun. Urbina. Spread your men, prepare for a Calvary charge. Well, he couldn't have helped anyway. Charge. Continue the attack. Urbina, we counter-attack. Come on back here, reform ranks. Viva Villa. Viva Villa. Retreat. Still alive, hey gringo? My general, Villa's forces have secured the outer perimeter. Our men are regrouping along secondary lines of defense. Villa in the trenches? Well? For once, it looks like we forced the bandit into our kind of war. Viva Villa. Through the wall. - What is that coming from? - I don't know, my general. - Viva Villa. - Viva Villa. - Viva Villa. - Viva Villa. I'm sorry my general, we did everything but shoot him ourselves. Come in. Something wrong Colonel Fuentes? Speak up. General Huerta wants to see you at his quarters, immediately Colonel Villa. Alright, as soon as I've finish my sweat bath. - That's not soon enough. - You must be crazy. What do you mean? That's not soon enough? You're under arrest Colonel Villa. - I want to send a message. - No, no, general... To President Francisco Madero. Dear Mr. President... The worst son of a bitch in your army has just arrested Pancho Villa. He says he is going to shoot him in the morning. If you don't do something about changing Huerta's mind, I will. Respectfully Major Rodolfo Fierro. - What are you doing? - Writing down the message sir. You don't waste time writing. Just send it the way I told you. Yes sir. You make sure he keeps sending. You tell Villa I sent a message to Madero. But not to count on Madero, only on us. You tell him if he gives the word, we will get him out. The girl and your money will be in Chupadero, we will all meet there. - I want to see the general. - General look, pardon me. Look general... I lost my airplane in your war and one of your officers promised to pay for it. Close the door. Which officer? You know very well which officer, Colonel Villa. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to see him and get this matter taken care of. Ah yes, oh yes, yes. Well very well Mr. Arnold. But, you neglect to mention one thing. It seems the airplane wasn't yours to begin with. - Cognac Mr. Arnold? - I believe I would, yes. Orderly, a cognac for Mr. Arnold. Now... Tomorrow morning, you'll be provided with a military escort... to the American Consulate in Laredo. From there, they will conduct you back to El Paso... where you will answer to charges of grand theft, among others. To your health Mr. Arnold. I... I don't suppose there's anything I can say that might... I'm afraid not. I'm doubly sorry Mr. Arnold, I assure you, we appreciate all you have done... for the revolution but you must also appreciate how important it is that I... My government, that is, maintain good relations with the United States. - You can see that, can't you? - Oh yes, I can see that. Good, you're under arrest. Hey gringo, that's me. - Learning pretty fast, pretty fast. - Yeah, you're alright. You'll be able to write your will before they shoot your tail all over that parade ground. You've got to know something I don't. Answer me, you made a deal with Huerta, eh? - He won't let it happen. - Oh, he won't? - How? - He won't. Chief, Madero is a long way from here. As a matter of fact, he's in Mexico City. Now, I know that you and Mr. Madero are the best of friends. Nobody has any more respect for the man than I do. But wouldn't be the first time in this revolution that... somebody forgot to protect a friend, now would it? - Gringo, you're dumb. - Alright. I may be, but you think about what I just said, eh? Madero won't protect me just because he's a friend. - No? - Of course not. To be shot, I have to be sentenced. To be sentenced, I have to be tried. To be tried, I have to be accused of having done something wrong. Now all this takes a long time. Besides, I haven't done anything wrong. But even if I had, Madero would protect me... because he wouldn't want a man to be deprived of his rights. He won't stand for injustice, so... Huerta cannot shoot me tomorrow. Now you understand? Yeah, I understand. I understand you're out of your mind. Chief, look... All you have to do is to get the word... to your men and they'll have you out of here, it's that simple. Not that simple. Well, you can't fight for the revolution if you're dead. I'm fighting for it right now, here. This is unjust, to deprive me of my liberty. Your liberty? What's that? Liberty, is the respect for the rights of others. That is what Benito Juarez said. That is what Madero believes in. That's what we've been fighting for. Now, if I walk out of here without a trial, I deny that, behave like a bandit. Well, just when have you stopped being a bandit? What about that little caper up in Conejos the other day? Those men were traitors. And Huerta knows it very well. No point in talking about it. Well, what about me Chief? How About me? I'm one of your men too, right? Something happens to you, they may as well shoot me. I'm deprived of 20 years of my liberty. I've got nothing, I've got no plane, no money... I wind up with nothing. Gringo? You never did have anything. You have lived just for yourself. Not for a cause, not even for a woman. Why you hypocritical... fat-headed grease-ball, don't you tell me who I am. - Hey. - What is it Colonel? The gringo. The gringo is mad. Attention. Stand here Colonel Villa. Let's go, hup. Forward, march. Forward, march. Left, right, left, right. Detail, halt. Left turn. Stand at ease. Important. Detail, attention. Ready, hut. - Now wait a minute. - Take aim, hut. I said hold it. Order, arms. At ease. What is it Colonel Villa? If I am going to be shot, I want it done by my own men. My Colonel, your men, they've been sent to other units. And some of your officers, they are under temporary arrest. Major Fierro is wanted for murder. Believe me, it wasn't my idea my chief. Colonel Fuentes? - Yes, my general. - Colonel Villa commands nothing now. Certainly not your firing squad, carry out my orders. But why? - You have to tell me why. - Detail, attention. I am Francisco Villa. I cannot be killed for nothing. Ready, attention. If you are going to shoot me, you're going to sentence me first. - Even if I have to choke it out of you. - Stop him or you'll all be shot. This is wrong. You know this is wrong. - Madero sent word. - Who said? I do. Colonel Villa... Are you going to stand and take your execution like a Mexican? Or shall I have you shot on the ground? Hey boy, come here. Keep this. - Forgive me my general. - For what? Be a good boy, shoot straight. Go on. Detail, attention. Ready, hut. Stop. The prisoner is to proceed on the heavy escort directly to Mexico City... where he will face a full inquiry regarding to Conejos hanging... and whatever subsequent court-martial proceedings deemed necessary. Francisco Madero, Presidente. The prisoner is to talk to no one. He's to be denied bed and food and barber. And if he escapes, responsible officers and men will be shot. The prisoner, left turn, march. Hey boy. Say, how would you fellas like to make some money? No, really. I'm rich, you know, very rich. If you are so rich, how come you've been to jail? Rich gringos don't go to jail, sometimes, they die. - But they don't go to jail. - I'm not rich. I just flat lied to you. Just want to see my girl, that's all. She lives right up here in Chupadero. I'll probably never see her again. Go to Chupadero. Fina? Fina. - Where are Fierro and Urbina? - The hills, Huerta's men are everywhere. - Where's the money? - Here. I don't suppose you gentlemen could give us a moment alone, could you? For just a minute gringo. - We'll be right outside. - Just in case you need us. Ok, where is it? Honey look, Villa is in jail in Mexico City. I'm trying to stay out of jail in El Paso. All I want is what they owe me, come on, let's hurry. They told me that some of that was to be used for the revolution and Madero. I'm taking it all. Well, I can't just stand here and count it, can I? Say I leave it, you know what they use it for? Shoot up a lot of peons who couldn't care less which dog is on top anyway. You don't want that, do you? - Say goodbye now gringo. - Look, I... I'll try to come back as soon as I get this straightened out. What for? You have what you want. Go, find someone else, I will. Come on gringo, let's go. - Howdy Lee. - Hey Dave, what's doing? Nothing much. Get this fuzz off me, will you partner? Oh hey, you hear what just happened down in Mexico? - What's that? - President Madero. They shot him up. - Kill him? - They sure did. One of his own generals too, General Huerta. And you know who's the new president of Mexico? The same General Huerta. Pretty funny games they play down there, eh? What about Villa? You hear anything about him, Pancho Villa? Yeah, yeah, he escaped from jail in Mexico City. Huerta has practically his entire army looking for him. - Must want him pretty bad, eh? - Yeah, I guess he does. Hey, Lee? Lee, is this Villa a friend of yours? Yeah, I know him. Well and then I had to find something to wear with the new jeweled collar daddy bought me. And I was so worried about finding exactly the right thing. Well in El Paso, especially. But then I saw this gown. It was in a little shop right catty corner from the hotel, of all places. Oh, it's marvelous. It's pitch black velvet, yards and yards of it. The bodice is all studded with garnets and oh, I just love it. It feels so, so sensuous. - Don't you just love velvet? - Very much. Of course, it was outrageously expensive but I just had to buy it. Anyway daddy says there's going to be a war in Europe... soon and the price of beef will go up and so we'll be very rich. Lee darling? Those men, they're annoying me. Over there. Lee darling, turn around. You don't mean to say you know those people? Do you know Mr. Arnold? Oh, very well. One moment please. I'm terribly sorry to bother you Mr. Arnold but those men... - It's alright Eugene. - Yes sir. You're not going to invite them to this table. - Hello Chief. - Hello gringo. - How are you? - Good. - We missed you. - You in town for long? I don't think so, we're getting ready to go home now. We'd like you to come with us. - And do what? - What do you mean do what? Take it, get rid of Huerta. You see, we thought... With our money that you've been keeping for us, we would buy guns. Now wait a minute Chief. Wait a minute. That's all over, can't you see that? The revolution is finished. You gave it your best shot Chief, but after all, Huerta is sitting in that palace... and Madero is dead and there's no way in the world you three are going to change that. No way. - We would like our money gringo. - I wouldn't give you a... I wouldn't give you a dime. What for? You go down there and shoot up a lot of your own people just... so some other dictator can call himself president? Madero was no dictator. Pancho? Don't argue with him. Shoot him and let's go. No. No, we don't do that anymore. Well... - Goodbye gringo. - Wait a minute, wait a minute Chief. What are you going to do? First, take Mexico City. Then find another Madero. I want you to know that I have never been so humiliated in all my life. To leave me here, sitting alone. - And in front of all El Paso... - Marsha, do me a favor, will you? Just shut up. May I have the check please. I'd like to write you a receipt Mr.Elmore. How much for the horses? Go ahead and be my guests. Get on those horses and go. No, we pay. When I get to Mexico City, I'll send you the money. How much? Well... If that's the way you feel about it... How about 35 dollars for all of them? Everything, the whole kit and caboodle. Not enough, 35 each. - You'll be hearing from me. - Pancho Villa.
