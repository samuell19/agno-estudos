Not to interrupt this sweet sister moment, but-- Oh, okay, Keith, I missed you too. Merry Christmas. I hope you're hungry. [Harper] I'm starving. Oh, I got your bag. - Oh, thank you. - Sure. [Harper] Oh my god! How are the girls? [Maggie] They are so excited to see you.

A house full of chefs. Not me, I'm all dishwasher. Which we will definitely need when your parents get here. This house is gonna get real cozy, real fast. Yeah. All right, I think we're ready. Cheers! - Cheers! - So much. - We missed you. - I missed you guys! Budapest at Christmas is amazing. Mm. Someday, I wanna travel all over Europe, just like you, Aunt Harper. Sounds like so much fun. How many countries did you visit? I visited seventeen, but I worked in eight, no, nine. All in museums? Yes, I started out as a tour guide, and I worked my way up to assistant curator. And took every possible museum job in between. Yeah, I mean, I met some interesting people that had great projects, so I was lucky to help out. My mom always says you're too nice to say no. Please, freshman year, A Christmas Carol. Set designs, costumes, props. Oh, and she sang in chorus. She never slept. So, I'm a multitasker, but now I actually am trying to just focus all of my energy on one job. Your aunt's got a big interview tomorrow at the Brooks Museum. [Petra] So you'd live here in Memphis? Well, I would be their international curator, so I will be based in Europe. But I would be home more often if I get the job. But what if you don't? Petra. No, it's true. That's a good question. It's a long shot. Um, I don't know. I'd just see where the job takes me. But enough about all that. I wanna talk about all the fun stuff we're doing for Christmas. Starting with this little thing. - Is that for us? - What is it? (gasps) It's a snow globe, it's London! And it's shooting stars! Thanks so much, Aunt Harper! [Petra] I love it. And speaking of Christmas, the top of my to-do list, of course, is seeing Christmas lights at Graceland. When can we go, tomorrow after school? [Petra] Please. Fine by me. [Keith] It's okay with me. Yes! (cheerful holiday music) [Taylor] Dad, is there any more yogurt? Okay, our big fundraiser's coming up, and let's say you have a perspective donor on the phone, what's your pitch? We've written some clever algorithms for a database to better connect patients with doctors that we're giving away to hospitals for a low, low price. For free, Davis, for free. Fine, for free. Hospitals can then digitize their patient records, in order to create a searchable, multi-user diagnostic data bank. I created this with you, and even I'm falling asleep. Okay, let's hear your pitch, Mr. Almighty Salesman. Something like this. There's an ocean of information out there, and we're giving hospitals a map to navigate between the islands. Okay, needs work, but I get the point. I still don't like the giving it away for free part, though. It's a lot better than selling it to help predict shopping trends, right? Yeah, if we can pull it off. Correction, if you can pull it off. You're the charming face of our company. I'm just your tech genius. Oh, and a humble one at that. Dad, you put turkey in my peanut butter and jelly sandwich again. Sorry. Okay, I'm ready. Ready? Where are your shoes? You were supposed to have them on three minutes ago. I've got socks. Nice try, go now. Tick tock! You can't go to school without a jacket today. Why not? It's not even snowing. But it's still gonna be cold. Yeah, and you still need to figure out your Christmas project for art class. You said you'd help me. Oh buddy, I didn't put it in the schedule. I'm so sorry. It's in there now, okay? And your sister's right, you need a jacket. You don't wanna be late for school. Uh, are you still there? Oh, Davis! I'm so sorry. Are you okay? You seem a little distracted. Where's your nanny? Vicki went home for the holidays, and our backup fell through. We're on our own. You plus three kids, no help? Owen, the fundraiser is less than two weeks away. Don't worry, I got it under control. Listen, I gotta get these kids out the door. We'll see you soon. Good luck. Thanks. All right gang, coats on. We're leaving in 60 seconds! (Owen sighs) - No, it's mine, stop! - Put it down! [Adelaide] Dad said it was mine! (gentle holiday music) So University of Memphis with a masters, and then advertising? I know, not the most traditional start. But the truth is there really weren't any jobs out there for art history grads. But I quickly realized that art truly is my passion, so I went to Europe, and I took every museum job I could find. Yeah, London, Munich, Barcelona. You have worked at a lot of galleries. But curator? That's a big step up. You know, most of our candidates have their doctorate. I can't compete with that level of academia. But for me, it's always been about giving the visitors a memorable experience. And whether that was at Graceland, where I gave tours all throughout high school, or at the Mission Gallery in Wales, where I co-curated an exhibit last year, I think that art should touch us emotionally, you know. You know the job is based in London, so you wouldn't be here very much. Well, I am used to living out of a suitcase. Well, great. Well, thanks for coming in. You're definitely one of our more interesting candidates. Well, I hope that's a good thing. Well if it is, you'll be hearing from our director for a second interview soon. Okay. We're hoping to fill the position before the end of the year. Good luck. Thank you, and thank you for meeting with me. It's been awesome. Have a great day. I will, you too. Thank you. (curious music) [Girls] Bye, love you! Bye, love you guys. Have fun at Graceland. Don't slip on the ice! Hey, girls! Thank you so much for doing this. Bye. Love you guys. (twinkling instrumental music) Okay girls, I want you to tell me the first thing that catches your eye. Wait, but don't look yet, don't look yet. You know we come here every year, right? I know, but like art, every time you come to Graceland at Christmas, you see something new, something magical, even if it's been there all along. Okay, so I want you to tell me what you see on the count of three. One, two, three! Okay, what do you see? I see one of the best tour guides we ever had. Regina, I was hoping I'd run into you! When did you get home? [Harper] Just a couple days ago. So lovely to see you, Miss Presley. Aw, you too. Girls, this is Regina. She was actually my boss when I was a tour guide here in high school. And this, of course, is Miss Priscilla Presley. Hi girls, welcome to Graceland. Hi. Hello. Are these your children? No, no, no, they're my nieces, actually. Oh, adorable. And how have you been? I just got back from Europe where I was traveling around and working at different museums. All right, you know, she might wanna go see the exhibit that you're working on. That's exactly what I was thinking. It's an Elvis at Christmas exhibit over at the museum, just something special for our employees and fans. I'd love to show it to you. Oh yeah, of course, I'd love to. Well, I'm gonna have to run. It was lovely to meet you. And Harper, welcome home. Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Bye, Miss Priscilla. - Merry Christmas. [Both] Merry Christmas. [Priscilla] Bye, thank you. Isn't she the sweetest? Hey Anna, you wanna go see the lions? Yes, they're so cute and fuzzy. [Petra] Come on. [Regina] It's good to see you. I'm so glad to see you. So Europe? It was amazing. So how long are you in town? Well, it may not be for very long. I just interviewed with the Brooks Museum to be their international curator. That sounds exciting. I know, I'm so excited. Well, I, I'm not excited. It's killing me, I have to wait about a week. I don't want to jinx it, but I'm horrible at waiting. Well, if you want to start giving tours again while you're here? Sure, yeah, I'll start today. Speaking of tours, I'm meeting a client who wanted to give his kids a private tour, and we are completely booked, so I've gotta go figure out a way to squeeze him in. Just have him join us. Oh no, you don't have to do that. Honestly, Regina, I don't mind at all. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You're a saint, always. Oh, that's them right there. Okay kids, I will be back before the tour is over. And unless, of course, you wanna come with me? And stay in a conference room all day, no thanks Well, I was just thinking that maybe-- - We'll be okay dad. - Okay. Owen Read, this is Harper Ellis. Longtime friend and tour guide extraordinaire. Hi, um, it's nice to meet you, Owen. You too, uh, this is my family. Adelaide, Millie, and Taylor. Hi, and this is Petra and Anna. [Both Girls] Hi. Harper will be giving your kids a tour of Graceland today. Well, thanks in advance. Yeah, kids are kinda my specialty, so I'll meet you back here by the lions in about an hour or so. Yeah, in an hour, got it. Okay, this is where you have fun. Hi. Okay, let's get started. Who can tell me Elvis's first Christmas song? No one, really? Come on, do not make me break out my choir skills, 'cause I will. Why do you look so scared? Come on, let's go inside. (cheerful holiday music) And then how many work parties have I planned for you at Graceland? Four, all amazing, but never a fundraiser. Okay, true. So what's the tone? What are you working for? I wanna inspire people. I want people to feel good about what we're doing at the company. Nice, I like that. So what are you thinking? I'm thinking silver and gold in a ballroom setting. Posh, but not pretentious. Stylish, not stuffy, okay good. - Yeah. - Decor? Huge decorative presents for the spirit of giving. How about nutcrackers as the centerpieces? Sleigh with reindeer. 'Tis the season. How about music? I like classical. Okay, classy. I gotta lot of giving, perfect. (gentle instrumental music) So you're going from here to a Christmas play to a work dinner? Busy time of year. And you're doing that all without help? Well, I thought I had a backup, but then she called-- ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ That was amazing. Do you guys have a manger? I need to make money. (kids laughing) Well I guess that, that wraps it up. [Kids] Aw! Well, it sounds like you had a great time. How was it? - It was awesome! - Amazing. Fabulous, it was so much fun! Well, it seems like you really are the tour guide extraordinaire. Oh, I'm not an actual tour guide. You're not? Well, she used to be, but-- I was, yeah. (Regina laughs) Oh, you're the nanny? Overture, no, not the nanny. Okay, now I'm really confused. Art is more my field, I work in museums. But right now, I'm just chilling with my nieces. Literally. (laughing) Well, you know, you guys could help each other out. With what? Well, you're here for a few weeks, waiting to hear about the job in London. London? And your au pair is out for the holiday. And you've got these three little kids, you need help. Oh, I see where you're going with this. Uh-huh. We have a guest house you could stay in. You'd make an awesome nanny, Aunt Harper. Okay, Petra, slow down. Are you trying to get rid of me? (girls laughing) I'll tell you what. Look, here's my card. Uh, no pressure, but we could use the help. [Harper] Oh, okay. Give me a call if you want. I will do that. Okay, say thank you for the tour. - Bye guys, Merry Christmas. - Thank you. Merry Christmas, bye. Merry Christmas. - Regina, we'll talk more. - Sounds good. [Both Girls] First to the car, jinx! I don't know how he does it all. Is he a single parent? Yeah, lost his wife three years ago. Oh, that's so sad. Christmases must be especially tough. Okay, I wanna hear all about London. Did you get to see Regent Street with all the Christmas lights? [Harper] Of course. (dogs barking) (girls laughing) I don't think Francis was a reindeer. He might've been. Yeah, I mean after Rudolph retired, right? All right girls, time for bed. [Millie] Five more minutes? Not tonight, Winter Express is leaving the station. Say goodnight to your Aunt Harper. [Both Girls] Goodnight, Aunt Harper. Love you, good game. (imitating train whistle) [Maggie] See you all upstairs. They're so smart, Yuletide. Hope that was worth some points. [Harper] Oh, it was. So I have a little favor to ask. What? Keith's parents are coming into town a week early. Like tomorrow early. Oh wow, great. Yeah. So usually Keith's parents sleep in Petra's room, and then the girls bunk in Anna's room. I hate to even ask you this, but do you mind sleeping on the couch? No, I don't mind at all, really. I'm the one overcrowding the place. Don't be silly, you're the best. I know. I'm gonna go say goodnight to the girls. Okay, I'll see you in a minute. Hm. (curious music) Why not? (curious music) Hi, Mr. Read, this is Harper. We met outside of Graceland. (gentle instrumental music) I know, I know, it's gonna be an incredibly busy day, and we still need to prep for our 10:00 a.m. run through, so I'll see you at 9:15 a.m. sharp. Dad! Give me a second, honey. Yeah, and let's review the slides for the presentation. Kay, gotta run, bye. Honey, where are your shoes? That's what I was gonna ask you. Okay, well we only have 18 minutes to find them, so come on, let's go. Where's your brother? (doorbell dings) [Millie] I don't know. Kay, keep looking. Only 17 minutes now. [Millie] Taylor! Hi. Hi, welcome. Sorry I'm late. Come on in. The kids are upstairs getting ready. Oh, look, you know, I must admit, I wasn't expecting you to call. Well, everybody needs a little extra help during the holidays, right? Plus, my sister works from home, so she doesn't really need me with the girls after school. And then, her in-laws were coming into town early, and it was just-- Oh, so you're just home for the holidays? Uh, well, yeah, that's the plan. But I was supposed to go to Europe for a month and ended up staying three years, so who knows? It all just depends on if I get that job or not. Oh, that's very spontaneous. Yeah, I'm pretty good at winging it. Yeah, no, that's great for certain situations. But just so you know, we like a little more structure. We've been on our own for a few years, so we have a system. Yeah, Regina mentioned your wife to me. I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you. Oh no, we're managing. Well, your children are adorable. And this house is amazing. Yeah, Adelaide mentioned we have the guest house that we just renovated, and if you wanna stay in there. If you take the job, you won't have to commute back and forth on all the icy roads. Everything you'd need for lunch is in the refrigerator, of course. And everything you'd need for the schedule is in here. Everything? Yeah, the day's schedule, it's broken down into hourly blocks. I know it's gonna be short-term, but their nanny finds it useful. Really? Yeah. I mean, I'm sure she does. Oh yeah, and it gives you alerts too, to keep you on track. Well, that is very planned out, yeah. And this is just for the weekdays? Oh yeah, believe it or not, weekdays are our quiet times. Well, you know, it seems like you've got a real firm handle on things. Um, I'm not really sure that this is the right-- Oh, terrific. Everything okay? [Adelaide] Hi, Miss Harper. Are you really gonna be our nanny? (bouncy music) I'm sorry, you were saying? Looks like my holiday just got a lot busier. Hey, my shoe! They only have a week left of school, but a lot to accomplish, including your art project, young man. Hey, maybe you can help him with it after school? I have to work late on the fundraiser. Again? Oh, not too late. Don't worry, art, I can definitely do. Great, so bring your things by, settle in. Just be here by 3:15 when the bus drops 'em off, and you have their schedule. Right, their schedule. [Owen] Okay, kids, time's a wasting. (engine humming) (curious music) (bright upbeat music) (curious music) (gentle instrumental music) (cell phone ringing) Hey Regina, I was just about to call you. Yeah, yeah sure, I can be there in 20. Okay, see you soon. (curious music) If I keep asking for favors, you're gonna stop taking my calls. Talking about an Elvis at Christmas exhibit is hardly a favor, Reg. Hey, I'm glad that worked out with Owen. Slow down, I just started. But it will keep me busy, until I hear back from the Brooks Museum, so that's good. I really do hope that happens. Art and travel, that's so you. I know, we'll see. Hey, I think this is really nice! Come on now, you had three years in some of the best museums in the world. Give me your insight. Okay, um, some insight. Um, what makes Graceland so amazing? Well, everything. But what brings people from all over the world coming back every year? What brings me back again and again? Well, I'm thinking Elvis Presley. Exactly, but it's not that Graceland is an exhibit. It's that it's an experience. I think the Elvis at Christmas exhibit shouldn't be just a bunch of memorabilia and photos, and all of that. I think it should be an experience that lets people in on how he really felt about the holiday, you know? What, what are you thinking? (sighs) That I wish I could take credit for that, that's what I'm thinking. (Harper laughs) Aw, you're so right! I knew you'd be honest, and if you weren't so busy, I'd ask you to work your magic. I'm not that busy. I'm not! And it wouldn't be a bad thing if the Brooks Museum found out I was working on it, right? Well, that's true, but girl, do you ever stop? Well, where's the fun in that? And plus, if I fall one second behind, this tablet will definitely let me know. So if you're asking, the answer's yes. Well then, welcome back to Team Graceland. Yes, this is gonna be so fun! (gentle instrumental music) [Owen] Good, good, good. These are solid. Just combine the two slides of the hospital statistics with the one in the case study, and I think we're good to go. On it, but you should practice your speech. How's it coming? Still noodling. I know, I need to get it right. (sighs) Hey, we may be partners, but all this came from you. So you need to dig deep, open up, make it personal. Don't worry, I'll get there. We just need enough donations on Christmas Eve, we can't fund it alone. That I cannot help you with. Why not? People like you, you're so charming. Well, yes I am, thanks for noticing. But do you remember when I did that interview for Lifewire? Oh, yeah. Uh-huh, and I spent 40 minutes pontificating on the benefits of big data. Trust me, I remember. I'll handle the fundraising [Davis] Good call. Well, at least you found a little help for the holidays, right? Yeah, it's fine, good. She's very nice, frustratingly likable. I just hope she's as organized as I'd like her to be. You like things organized? Uh ha, very funny. (Davis laughs) The kids don't need any more variables. They just need a good Christmas, that's all. And they will, I promise. Okay, you're doing great. You're raising those kids, this fundraiser. Sandra would be very proud. Thanks, pal. All right, go make some variant code or something. I got phone calls to make. Got it. (soothing music) Okay, so homework's done. Next up, we have to make presents for your grandparents? They can't make it out this year. So we have to mail them. Soon. Okay, and then, make your Christmas lists, but first-- [Kids] Chores. Right. Where do you guys keep your aprons? Aprons? Why do you need aprons? Well, you don't need them necessarily, but I'm not the tidiest baker, so-- We're baking? I feel like you've got a lot to do. You might need some Christmas sugar to get that energy up. We're baking! I have a good idea, come on. (guitar holiday music) (kids laughing) And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a Yule log. Oh! I see, it's a treat and a tree. I got hooked on these in Brussels, so good. Looks delicious. It's not done though. It has to look like that, so you guys got to get to garnishing. Who wants to start? Me! And you, my friend, will be responsible for frosting the next one. - Okay. - Come on, over here. So what's the theme again? For what? For your art project. Oh, Santa's home in the North Pole. Oh, cool. They left it pretty open. I have a week to build it. My dad was gonna help, but you know-- He's got a lot going on. Yeah. Do you have any ideas? Well, everybody is making the Santa's castle or Santa's home, but I was thinking, "Where do the elves live?" That's genius! You know, my sister and I would make igloos out of sugar cubes. Could that work? That'd be a lot of sugar cubes. (laughs) It would. Harper, is this enough berries? Wow, ladies, that's gorgeous. But I think we could add a few more. Dad, you're home early! Hey kids, what do we have here? I guess this means you're done with your homework and chores? (bouncy music) Yule log? Harper, can we talk for a minute? Yeah, sure. Mm, I know the kitchen's kind of a disaster, but we were just having a little fun, getting to know each other, so-- No, that's important. Yeah, I thought so. But they've also got a schedule. We were working on that. They just needed a little break. I appreciate that, I do. But first they do their homework, then chores. No, I understand that. It's just, it's the holidays, and everything gets thrown off, right? My mom used to say that's what makes them so special. Their mother used to embrace the chaos too. I'm sorry, that was insensitive of me. No, it's fine. I just wanna make sure my kids enjoy Christmas. And that doesn't happen unless they follow the plan. So if we could just do that? Okay. Thank you. I'll start cleaning this up. - Okay. - Okay. You should really try a piece though, it's delicious. I just might. (suspenseful music) (soothing music) Are you kidding me? Of course I wanna be there. [Maggie] Are you sure? I feel like you have way too much going on. Help out at the girls' school? I'm never too busy for that. Oh, I do remember you being pretty good at making wreaths. It'll be fun, and it's for a good cause. And then I'll just go over the exhibit with Regina afterwards. And other than that, I just have to have the kids ready by 4:00 p.m. sharp, no exceptions. None, really? Apparently not, but they are going to get their Christmas tree, so that'll be fun for them. And this exhibit will be fun for everyone, if I can tackle it. You will, I just, I don't know how you do it all. Being single helps. You know, you could tackle that too. And start dating, who has time for that? Everyone, but you have to make time for it. Well, I did it before, and we all know how that ended, so no thank you. And besides, if I were in a relationship, I would have way less time for wreath making, and exhibits, and hanging out with you guys, so-- All right, good point. All right, I'm gonna go. I'll see you in the morning with bells on. See you then. ♪ I hear the bells ♪ ♪ Saying Christmas is near ♪ ♪ They ring out ♪ ♪ to tell the world ♪ It's just a little break. I mean, what kid doesn't like to take a break from homework and chores? I know. Well, Owen doesn't like breaks, unless they're scheduled breaks, of course, on the tablet. I'm sure he appreciated it. You know, some people are just harder to read. Well, yeah, he's definitely got that confident, tough exterior thing down. But I can see that he's just, you know, trying to keep it all together. And his kids, his adorable kids, they're just, they just want more of him, you know? Mm. Ugh, maybe I'm just overthinking it. I'm just gonna roll with it. You always do. Um, Aunt Harper, can you put a bow on this? Mine too, I like yours better. No, yours is amazing! But yeah, I'll put a bow on it. Go grab me some ribbon. [Petra] Okay. They were super excited that you were coming today. Aw, I miss this. Yeah, I do too. Don't make me cry, come on. We're not allowed to cry when there's Christmas music playing. You know what, let's just look at the bright side. 'Cause if I don't get this job, I'll be back on your couch in a couple weeks. You know what, I would love that. But it's not gonna happen. You're going to get this job. Nobody's more deserving of it than you. Aw, you know what, you're right. They would be lucky to have this amazing wreath maker. (Maggie laughs) How many more do we have to make? Like five? A hundred? 500? Yeah. - Oh my god. - I think so. Oh, here. [Petra] Thank you, Aunt Harper. Okay, so the idea is to make it feel vibrant, and magical, and fun, but still feel like an intimate insider's experience. Okay, so it's still Elvis at Christmas, but during different points of his life? Yeah, and we would show his humble beginnings in Mississippi, and his service in Germany in Graceland. But not in a linear chronology. So I envisioned guests being able to walk in and out of, I know, isn't that cool? Yeah. These life-sized scenes, made with mixed media, so they just feel closer to Elvis at Christmas. I love it, and the scope seems doable. By Christmas Eve though? Well, the King really made the holiday party much later. Good point. Okay, you keep working your magic. I'm gonna work on the live entertainment, because we certainly can't have Christmas at Graceland without that. Definitely not. (bouncy instrumental music) How's your homework coming along, guys? [Adelaide] Not done yet. And you, Taylor? I don't think I have enough sugar cubes. Okay, well, we'll get some more later, but not now. Where's Millie? Right here, have you seen her other shoe? So I guess you could say they're almost ready. Okay guys, we have one hour to get tree. Can Miss Harper come with us? To get the tree? No honey, I think that's more of a family thing. But you need a tree too. Yeah, for your room. Okay, well, I'll find time to get one later. Oh yeah, we know how much you love schedules and hate being spontaneous. Okay, so you guys really want me to come? Yeah. Except now we only have 58 minutes to get the tree. Your call. Well, I guess we better hurry up and get some trees. [Millie] I get to pick the tree! [Taylor] No, it's my turn. [Millie] I get to pick! [Adelaide] You got to do that last year. (bright holiday music) Let me find the tree. Not if I find it first. Remember, it's Millie's year to pick the tree. See? [Harper] You can all help me find mine. Yeah, and stay focused if you wanna have time for gingerbread cookies. Oh wait, so you don't have a problem with all baked goods, just Yule logs? Funny. And you, how are things with you? I'm good, yeah. Regina asked me to help with the Elvis at Christmas exhibit. Well, that's got to be a good thing? Yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I can work on it at night, so it won't interfere with this at all. I was actually wondering if the kids could come see it. It's just gonna be a work in progress. Um, they're pretty booked. Right, sure. It's just, their days are just so planned out, it doesn't really leave much wiggle room. For what? Anything else. Yeah, I know, it's just you let one thing slide, and I just don't want anything else to unravel. [Millie] Hey Dad, look! Okay, is that your pick? It's perfect on all sides. Is everyone else happy? Okay, good. We got this one for you, Harper! That's mine? It's perfect, I love it! Okay, it's gingerbread time. Oh, you're right, it is perfect. Everyone picks their favorite Christmas carol, and then they hold hands and sing it around the tree. Where is this from again? It's a Danish tradition. I learned it in Copenhagen. That sounds fun. Well, do you think you'd bump in the tree, knocking the ornaments off? Fine, we'll just pick one and sing around the piano. How's that? Ugh, as fun as that sounds, I still have some work to do. You said you'd help us decorate the tree. I thought you were gonna help me with my project. We'll have to do it another time, okay? I'm sorry, just a few more evenings, okay? And I'm sure Harper's amazing at decorating. Yeah, I can decorate with them. Is it just this one box? Oh yeah, our basement flooded a few years ago, ruined most of them, been meaning to get more, but-- Oh, I can take 'em out ornament shopping, if you want. Well, why don't you get started with this one, and then you need more, we'll get 'em. Be creative. I'll just be in my office. I'll be right back, as soon as I can. Who's ready to get creative? [Kids] Me! Wow, you guys have a lot of art supplies. I thought I wanted to become a fashion designer, but now I'm thinking an illustrator. Well, I think you'd be good at either, maybe both.

Did you see it? I did, it's the best snowman ornament ever. Sleep tight, okay. Goodnight, Daddy. (twinkling music) You had a busy night. Oh, hey. Yeah, um, about that, we probably went a little overboard, but-- Thank you. Oh, sure. I don't know how you did it all in one night, but this place looks great. Well, I had some pretty awesome elves assisting me. They even helped me decorate my own tree. Oh, I'm glad. Are you? Mhm. Hey, I'm meeting Regina tomorrow. Why don't you meet me with the kids? At Graceland? Yeah, we'll go Christmas shopping after, you can join us. Yeah, sure I'd love to. Good, goodnight. Goodnight. (hopeful music) So when did you have time to go out and get all this stuff? Oh, the shopping in Europe is amazing. You shouldn't have. Oh, stop. So how's Owen and the whole tree decorating? Was he really okay with all that sparkle? Yeah, I think he actually kinda liked it. Maybe he's a bigger softie than you thought. Yeah, he's getting there. Ugh, the kids though. They are total marshmallows, so sweet. Well, I can't wait to meet him. Them. I can't wait to meet them. The whole family. - Them. - What? Not him. (Maggie laughs) Couldn't help myself. You guys finally get to check out what we've been working on. So eventually, all of these photos and videos, and all kinds of stuff is gonna be inside of the exhibit to show how important family and Christmas were to Elvis. Is that where he grew up? Yes, modest, but it really was full of love. Oh, and that is Christmas 1958, when he was stationed in Germany. And the story goes that he sang "Silent Night" for all of his fellow soldiers. - Aw. - Isn't that cool? Yeah. I'll try and get you final numbers soon. Okay, I'll be ready. Can you imagine how great it's gonna be when it's done? Okay, let's get those presents. ("Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas") Millie, I did not know how you were gonna wrap that family tree, but it looks amazing. You think they'll like it? Oh, I'm sure your grandparents will love anything from you. And I hope you guys like something that I found for you. I know there's only nine more days until Christmas, but I saw this, I thought you had to have it. An advent calendar! Beautiful, and it lights up. And when you pull out the drawers. (twinkling music) Aw. (Owen laughs) I know this one! [Millie] I know this one too! Do you know it? What are the words? ♪ Ho, ho ho, who wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Ho, ho ho, who wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Up on the rooftop, click, click, click ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney with old Saint Nick ♪ (all laughing) And also, one last surprise. In each drawer is. Ooh! Did this come with it, or did someone put them in there? I don't know, I didn't put them in there. Maybe the elves did? Probably, yeah. Okay, what do you say to Harper? Thank you. You're welcome. (cellphone ringing) Oh, you know what? Oh, I think this is the Brooks Museum. Go get 'em. Yeah, this is Harper. Okay, who wants hot chocolate? - I do! - Me! (bouncy holiday music) Special delivery, compliments of my three little elves. Thank you, that looks amazing. Enjoy. Mm, wow that's good hot chocolate. What's your secret? Millie put extra marshmallows. Go after my own heart. So what did the museum say? They want to see me for a second interview tomorrow. That's great. Yeah, I scheduled it while the kids are in school, so don't worry about it. I'm not worried, but you seem to be. Do I? No, um, yeah I'm a little nervous, I guess. You'll be fine. Just be your unique self. After seeing all that you're doing with the Graceland exhibit, they'd be lucky to have you. Thank you for saying that. Maybe I should just bring her one of these? Oh, well then you'd definitely get the job. (Harper laughs) Oh hey, I know I was supposed to take the kids skating tomorrow, but my sister and nieces are going sledding, do you think that's close enough? Uh, don't let Wayne Gretzky hear you say that. (Harper laughs) Yeah, you're fine, no problem. I'll let you get some rest. Okay, and Owen, I know you're doing everything you can to make this a great Christmas, and you are, but I feel like what the kids want more than anything, is just to spend time with you. That's the best gift, right? You're right. Thank you for saying that. Of course, goodnight. Goodnight. (gentle piano music) (gentle instrumental music) [Allison] Harper. [Harper] Hi. [Allison] Hi, I'm Allison, director of the museum. [Harper] It's so nice to meet you. [Allison] Thanks for coming in. [Harper] Of course. There seems to be a lot of good buzz, surrounding the Graceland exhibit. I know I'm excited to see it. Well, thank you. I'm excited to be doing it. I think it'll be the perfect Christmas gift to all the Elvis fans. [Allison] I like your confidence. [Harper] Thank you. [Allison] You definitely have a lot of varied experience. Well, I've been on the go for quite some time, so, which is how I've been able to see so much incredible art firsthand, and figure out what really speaks to me. And recognizing that is essential for a curator of international exhibits. I'm assuming more travel made this position a bit more enticing? It did. I mean, it does, yeah. Um, I'm just curious though, do you think you'd ever need anybody based here? Right now, our need is in London, overseeing art exhibits in Europe. But I do appreciate your enthusiasm. Well, it's an amazing opportunity, one that I'm truly honored to be in the running for. I have a lot to consider, but I'm excited to see your work in action. See you soon. Merry Christmas. (sighs) Okay. Our program connects those islands, like a billion bridges. [Man On Phone] It was okay. Hold on there, son. That's a nice speech, but I'd rather hear from the heart. Frankly, I'd rather hear a bunch of computer mumbo jumbo. Of course, yes, I understand. [Man On Phone] Owen, if you're looking for a few bucks, I'm not your man. But I like what you're doing, and if you hit your goal, I'll double it. Okay, that would be a game changer. [Man On Phone] If you hit your goal. Of course, yes, thank you. We won't disappoint. We could double our distribution! Take on the whole south east! Nicely done! We are both on our game today! That's why I'm here ten minutes early to review the upgrades of our interface program, and yeah, bee impressed with that. Yeah about that, uh, change of plans. Come again? Harper's taking the kids sledding. So? Oh, so you wanna go, like right now. 'Cause I don't know the last time you canceled. Rescheduled. Yeah, anything. Are you sure you don't want to come tonight? To a stuffy dinner, filled with industry competitors? Yeah no, gonna hold that for our party, but thank you. Thank you for understanding. We'll go sledding next time. - Thank you. - Thanks. [Maggie] You guys have fun. Don't go too fast. The faster you go, the safer it is. Not true. (kids screaming excitedly) Says the girl who never slows down. When was the last time you took a night off? The night I got here, I didn't do anything that night. Jet lag doesn't count. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Hey, I didn't know you were coming. This is my sister, Maggie. This is Owen. Oh, nice to meet you finally. Likewise. So how was the interview? We'll see. [Adelaide] Dad! Ugh (laughs), hey you having fun? Yeah. I guess now is a good time to ask, would you and the kids like to come over tonight? Cookies and a Christmas movie? Yes, we love cookies. I would love to. Unfortunately, I have a fancy holiday party to go to. Bunch of big vendors are gonna be there, so I can't miss it. Well, it sounds fun. Uh, not so much, business. Well, it's a Christmas party. Who doesn't love Christmas parties? You could go. Keith and I will watch the kids. Harper could go, right? She could go with you. Maggie, you can't just invite me to his business parties. That's not how it works. You said you don't get out much. Okay, I said that, but it's true. It's true. I really think you should go. Yeah, you know what, why don't you come? It'll be fun. Really? Yeah. Well, how fancy is it? (curious bouncy music) [Millie] Can you pass me the sugar cutter? I wanna cut one. Millie flips out when she's tired, Taylor gets more energy, and Adelaide should just tell you. When the kids get done with this cookie making session, they're probably just gonna pass out, like even before the movie. Are you sure you wanna do this? I feel like five kids is a lot to handle. Don't worry, Keith is helping, and his parents are here too. And when the kids get tired, I'll just take them back to Owen's and wait for you to get home. Maggie, you don't need to do that, really. It's no big deal. Just go have fun, you deserve it. (inhales sharply) What if we have nothing to talk about? Please, you can talk to anyone, even if he's handsome. Maggie, stop! Or I'm gonna put some sweats on and come over to your house right now. [Maggie] Okay, okay, just please enjoy your one night off. Uh, Mom, we need some help. Oops, gotta go. All right, love you, sis. (soft piano music) Hey. Wow, you look. Is it too fancy? I know you said fancy, I wasn't sure. No, just really beautiful. Well, thank you. So are you ready for a dazzling evening with high-tech computer job? Well, now that you put it that way. (gentle music) (Harper laughs) (gentle piano music) When we heard you were applying your systems to the medical field, and doing it for free, we thought you'd lost your mind. I know, it sounds nuts, but it's really invigorating our engineers, and I think hospitals will really benefit. We just need to raise enough money, or we can't pull it off. Hint, hint. Oh, you expect me to just give money away? Well-- (laughs) Just kidding, of course you can count on me. Okay, now I'm really happy I came, 'cause these croquettes are amazing. You have to try one. Oh, hi. Hi. Is this your date? Oh, no. Friends. Family, she takes care of my kids. Normally, well not tonight obviously. Okay. And also, I don't date, so there's that. Whoa, I clearly got that wrong. Harper, this is Radford, our host. We spent a lot of money on his computers over the years. So nice to meet you. You've thrown an amazing party. Thank you. Well, as much as I'd love to stay and chat, I have to give a speech, so see you on Christmas Eve. See ya. - Harper. - Hm. Wow, well that couldn't have been more awkward. I'm so sorry, and probably shared too much information. No, it was illuminating. You don't date? No, I date. I have dated. I had a serious relationship, where I pictured it all, the house kids, the whole nine yards. And then? Then he changed his mind, said he didn't see it anymore, at least not with me, so-- And so you moved to Europe? Well, first I stayed here and wallowed for a good while. And then eventually, I just decided I needed to pick myself up and go do what I love. And you've been on the move ever since? Yeah, I guess so. Familiar tale. Get your heart broken, get busy to distract yourself, and then three years have flown by. Okay, enough about that. What about you? You have to share something. - Me? - Yeah. About dating? Sure, or anything. Okay, it took a while. But yeah, I've dated a little. Just after everything that happened, I wanna get it right. Yeah. They're serving dinner. I hope you're still hungry. Oh, I'm always hungry. This is so pretty. Yeah, isn't it? Is this sort of similar to the party that you've thrown? Uh. [Harper] Thank you. Oh, no, no, no, no. What? What's wrong? Oh, this is not good. Oh, it's bad. This is exactly like the party we're throwing. Oh. The classical music, the oversized presents, the sleigh, the reindeer. He even has nutcrackers on the table. Owen, who cares? It's not like the same people are gonna be at your party. It's virtually the same guest list. Oh. Well, you know what? Why don't we just take these nutcrackers right off the table and hide 'em? Kidding, kidding, kidding, I'll put the nutcracker back. Hey, hey! Listen, it's gonna work out, I promise. You worry too much. You good? I'm good. Okay. Cheer up, Owen Read, it's Christmas. Good evening, everybody. Thank you all so much for coming out. Try and keep this short and sweet. So good to see so many faces I know and love out there. [Harper] Ooh, I'm so glad the kids had fun. Aw, I think they want to spend the rest of the holidays together. Aw, that's so sweet. So cute. Thank you again for tonight. I really appreciate it. Love you. Love you. Oh, the kids left something for you on the counter, for both of you. Oh, what is it? I don't know. Goodnight. Get home safe. Everybody's fast asleep. Oh, they had a busy day. And they left us this. What is it? I don't know. Sprinkles. Frosting. Oh, happy decorating. How can we say no to that? Decorating cookies is on our list, but I'm not sure I can cross it off if we're not all here together. I think as long as they get decorated, you can just cross it off the list. Good plan. And also, things can fall of the list. That makes me uncomfortable. Sure it does. You know what my favorite childhood memories are? What? Staying in our pajamas, lounging, and laughing, and eating. No agenda, just hanging out. Mm. That's what your kids are gonna remember. Just hanging out? Yes, with you. Tour guide, nanny, philosopher, artist. You might have a calling there. Yeah, I just might if I don't hear back for this curating job. Yeah, when are you supposed to hear back? I have a feeling they're gonna wait and see how this exhibit goes. No pressure, right? But it has given me a chance to really stop and think. About what? What I really want. It's been really nice being home with family and back in Memphis. (sentimental music) It's really great having you here with us. I mean, the kids love having you around. If I can just figure out a solution for this fundraiser. I'm sure you'll think of something. How do we inspire people to donate if it's more of the same? If we don't inspire, then we can't reach our target. And if we don't reach our target, then all of the matching funds go away. What if we combined our events? I mean, they're already on the same night. Move the fundraiser to where, the museum? I think it could actually really work. I mean, Elvis was an incredibly charitable guy, right? Especially at Christmas, he gave to all the local charities, including hospitals, which is who you want to help. Is that even possible on such short notice? It's a week away. I mean, yeah, we would have to talk to Regina, but I feel like it could be a win-win. That would be a lot of work. Since when has a lot of work stopped you before, Owen Read? (bouncy holiday music) I just love that we could add a charitable component to this event. I'll have a call out to our music promoter that we worked with before to see if he can bring somebody in to perform. Regina, I know it's a lot to change in a week, but it fits together so perfectly. Elvis, charity, and Christmas. Yeah. Let's get started. ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ ♪ I don't need a lot of presents ♪ ♪ To make my Christmas bright ♪ ♪ I just need my baby's arms ♪ ♪ Wound around me tight ♪ ♪ Oh oh Santa, hear my plea ♪ ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ ♪ The Christmas tree is ready ♪ ♪ The candles all aglow ♪ ♪ But with my baby far away ♪ ♪ What good is mistletoe ♪ ♪ Oh oh Santa, hear my plea ♪ ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ ♪ Please make these reindeer hurry ♪ ♪ Well, their time is drawing near ♪ ♪ It sure won't seem like Christmas ♪ ♪ Until my baby's here ♪ ♪ Fill my sock with candy ♪ ♪ And a bright and shiny toy ♪ ♪ You want to make me happy ♪ ♪ And fill my heart with joy ♪ ♪ Then Santa, hear my plea ♪ ♪ Santa, bring my baby back to me ♪ Can you believe in 24 hours all of this hard work is finally gonna pay off? What do you say, we grab a bite at Gladys's and celebrate? Yeah! Yeah, we could do that. Do you mind if we stop by the mansion afterwards? I just have a little something I need to take care of. Yeah, I don't see why not. Great. So what exactly are we doing here? Well, Graceland has a family tradition that I wanted to share with you. Well hello, welcome everyone. Okay, so now I'm even more confused than the first day we met. Hi, Owen. Hi Owen. Well, a little birdie told me that you missed out on decorating your Christmas tree this year. So we thought we could give you another chance. Do we really get to help you decorate your tree? Yes, you do. I did hear that you were experts. (all laughing) You know, the first time that I came to Graceland, it was Christmas time too. It was really magical. These ornaments are amazing. These just aren't any old ornaments. They were given to us by guests, and even some fans. They were Elvis and my favorites. Amazing. You know, when you decorate the tree, I always like to put the tinsel on perfectly, just as if there were icicles all over. And then when Elvis would come in, well, he would just take all the tinsel and he'd toss it up to the top of the tree, and then let it just go everywhere. And then, come back and take all the credit for it. (all laughing) Miss Presley, this is so incredible. I'm sure everyone is just excited. Thank you. Well, I'm just sorry that I can't be there for your big event tomorrow night. And just wanted to share with you my appreciation for both of you. Thank you. So should we go and decorate the tree? [Kids] Yes! What? I can't believe you did this. 'Tis the season. When I was little, we used to come here every single Christmas, so you know, it just kinda feels like home. I just think it's so magical. Well, isn't that what home's supposed to feel like? Okay, we ready for the tinsel? [Owen] I am. ♪ Listen to those wondrous bells ♪ ♪ And you'll hear them say ♪ ♪ Open up your hearts to all ♪ ♪ On this holiday ♪ Okay, so you had the most spectacular day? We did, it was great. And getting to decorate with Priscilla Presley at Graceland? Come on. I know, it was so cool. Hey listen, Owen's gonna take the kids, and I was thinking, I could come over to your place and we could get ready and go to the party together. Glam it up. The girls are gonna love that. I'm excited. Me too. All right, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Oh no, I was just talking to my sister. Hey, thanks for tonight. It was totally unexpected. Yeah, I had a really great time. Yeah, me too. I better go work on my speech. Okay. I know you don't, or you know, haven't done much of it lately, I was wondering if you'd be my date? To our party? Officially. I'd love to. You would? Yeah, I just told my sister that I would get ready with her and the girls at her place though. Oh yeah, totally understandable. Maybe you could just pick me up from there? Okay. It's a date. Okay. (awkward bouncy music) Speech. (gentle instrumental music) Finally, I thought you were standing us up. What? No, never. Sorry, it's just everything today is taking way longer than expected. Then you better start getting ready. Okay, I know that tonight is supposed to be just fun for everyone, but what if it doesn't go well? What, the exhibit? And Owen's party. I mean, he's never thrown a fundraiser before, and I certainly haven't. And then what if the director from the Brooks Museum actually does show up? Okay, stop. You've got two really great events going on, the chance to help a lot of people, and we're all gonna be there to support you. Is that really what's bothering you, or are you a little nervous about it being a date? Okay, fine, I'm not not nervous about it being a date. He is pretty incredible. Oh! But I don't even know how much longer I'm gonna be here, so it's pointless. He knows that too, but you're here now, so why don't you just go with the flow? It's what you always tell me to do. That's not that easy. It actually is. You've been doing it your whole life, just not with your heart. Okay. (cheerful holiday music) Wow, you look absolutely incredible. Thank you. Just keeping with the color theme. You look very handsome. Thank you. Well, shall we go? Yeah, we wouldn't wanna be late. Harper, wait, don't forget your coat. - Oh, of course. - Hi, Owen. Hi you two, we'll see you in a bit. See you guys later. (sentimental music) (upbeat music) (crowd chattering) ("Frosty the Snowman") For someone who doesn't like fancy parties, you sure clean up pretty good. I had to bring my A game, didn't I? And so do you, if we're gonna get Graham to match our goal. Saw him on the way in. (people chattering) And I would say in on Frosty. Great, give me a moment? Yeah. You are amazing, you know that? I think people are really loving this. The night's young, let's see how it goes. Ooh, it's gonna be like that, huh? I just don't wanna be overly optimistic. (Harper laughs) Okay, hate to be that girl and have to interrupt, but our guest singer is running late. What? Apparently the roads from Nashville are really icy, but your presentations already been done, so I'm gonna switch it up and you go first? Oh, you mean, like, okay, yeah I could do that. You'll be great. Just be yourself. Okay. And remember that people always give from their heart, so it'll be great if you speak from yours. Thanks for the tip. Good luck. [Allison] Harper. Allison, you made it. I wasn't sure I was gonna find you before I had to leave. I'm actually on my way out. Oh, already? I have another engagement, but I'm really impressed. You are? The emotion behind the exhibit is really powerful. The charitable event on top, terrific. I know this is a big night for you, so I'll keep it brief. The job is yours if you want it. Really? Well, as long as you leave for London by the 28th. The 28th? That's so soon. We want someone fully settled in by the new year, so yes. Listen, why don't you take tomorrow to think about it, and let me know. [Harper] Okay. Here's my card again. Just call my cell. Okay, thanks Allison. Have a great night. - Sure, you too. [Owen] Good evening. (audience applauding) Merry Christmas. (soft piano music) Thank you for being here tonight. I gather you're having fun? (audience applauding) I just wanna take a brief moment, and thank everybody at Graceland. Regina, you and your team knocked it out of the park again. And Davis, my business partner, I love you buddy. We're here in honor of Elvis's legacy of giving, and his many charitable contributions at Christmas. So let's give it up for Elvis, come on. (audience applauding) I said many times before, there is an ocean of medical information out there, and our company's mission is, (clears throat) our company's mission. (sighs) You know, I had this whole speech. You know, we all go through difficult times in life. Me and my family know this as well as anyone. But it wasn't until recently that someone so special came into our lives, and showed me just how important the heart of the family is, and how we need to cherish the time we spend together. When you walk out of here tonight, you will feel certain that your generosity will allow us to help those in need do just that. Quicker diagnoses, faster treatment time, higher cure rates. All of that equals one thing, more time to do the things in life that really matter. And with your help, we're giving away this technology for free. (audience applauding) Merry Christmas. Wooh! (audience applauding) (bright holiday music) Any word? They're still trying to get here, but this just doesn't looked promising. I'm sorry, everyone's so excited. No, no, it's not your fault. Hey kids, we hit a little problem. We heard. You did? Don't worry, we have a backup plan. What is it? Okay girls, what's so important? You have to sing. What? Sing? You just have to. Right now, in front of everyone? We'll sing with you, if that helps. Dad promised everyone a performance, and I think we should give it to them. It's actually not a bad idea. Okay, well if you all sing with me, I guess we could sing a carol. - We could do that. - You will? Okay, well, let's give these people a Christmas at Graceland they're never gonna forget. I can't believe you're making me do this. (crowd chattering) Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately due to weather, our musical act couldn't make it tonight. [Audience] Aw! However, instead, we have a very special performance. (audience applauding) Feel free to sing along if you want. Please do, please.

Good, because I, I never expected to feel like this. Especially after the first day. But I've never met someone as incredible as you. I got the job at the Brooks Museum. [Owen] Oh. I just ran into the director. Are you gonna take it? I don't see how I could say no, right? Wow, I have bad timing. I'm sorry I said all that. No, don't be sorry. Everything that you said, honestly I-- No, it's okay. When do you have to leave? Right after Christmas. So soon? Congratulations. It's what you've always wanted. I'm really happy for you.

Mm, hmm, I don't know, I just, I guess I just really love being around you guys, and I forgot how much I really do love it here, so it'll be hard to leave. And all the rest. What rest? They're a pretty special family. Oh, no, Maggie, this is not about them. And I couldn't stay here for good. Why not? You can do anything you want. I've known that about you forever. But you're the only one who knows what's in your heart. It's all in the feeling, right? Thank you everybody, Merry Christmas, thank you. (audience applauding) (soft jazz music) Allison, hi, this is Harper Ellis. Do you have a minute? ("Jingle Bell Rock") Well, you put everything you got into this, and it worked. We're gonna be able to get this program off the ground in no time. I know it was a risk, but it was worth it. (soft piano music) Just don't stop there, okay? I know you like to be able to control things whenever you can, but love, love doesn't work that way. Doesn't mean it's not worth it, and it doesn't mean you can't make it work. (sentimental music) Hey, what are you doing here? I'm trying to roll with things more, so-- Wow, that's big. Yeah. Where are all the kids? Yeah, they're giving us a minute. So I know we won't have it all figured out yet. No master plan? Nope. We don't wanna lose you. I don't wanna lose you. Really? Really. Well, that's good to know. But I don't think I'm going anywhere. What? You're not taking the job? I thought it was what you wanted? Two weeks ago it was. So what changed? I did. I realized that I wanna be here with the kids, and you, and my family, so I told her that I wanted to be based here and gave her my best pitch. What'd she say? She said she'd think about it. Okay, look, you don't have to decide anything right now. Whatever you want, wherever it takes you, we'll make it work. That's all I ever wanted. I think you just made our Christmas. Mine too. (bright instrumental music) (all laughing) Didn't you guys set the timer like I said? Sometimes they go really fast. (gentle holiday music) (bright holiday music)
