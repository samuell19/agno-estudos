Fenno-Film presents Ilmari Kianto's THE RED LINE Screenplay and direction: Matti Kassila No point going on now, it's getting dark. How are we going to manage this winter? We've got to! How are we going to keep our children alive? You put them in this world, so you have to feed them. There are two stones in a poor man's mill! God's power keeps them grinding! They may grind, but nothing comes out! Look what it's done again! Sake, clean the cradle and throw that out. Not with your bare hands! Get a piece of wood! Hurry up! Vesteri, open that door! All this smell in here! Bring the bucket closer! And another one is wetting the floor... Why don't you go to the outhouse? Iita Linta Maria! She wet the floor! The pot is of no use! There you are sitting by the lake shore! Topi, you clean that! I haven't time to be everywhere! Close that door, my feet are freezing. And the brats are just another obstacle and chore! A mill you say! Nothing runs in this place but bare asses! Aren't you going to cook any porridge? - Cook it yourself! - All right... Where are the grits? You go find some! Look in your big keg. - Right you are! - You'll find some all right. - Boys, bring a light! - Topi, go on! It's empty. Good God! Daddy, look at that! See how it whirls around... Have to go to the village. We're even running low on bread. Let father have some! There you go. The children can have some milk when I go to the cow. The cow! Here you are. Come and get it! Move over now! There, there! Mother will give you some milk. Come to mother. Here's your milk. - And how are things, Tobias? - Just the usual worries. Indeed, indeed! What brings you here? I just came to ask the priest if anything has come from Helsinki. Any charity for the poor? Tobias, I have told you before! When people are in trouble, they must come to church to pray. God will grant your wish. - Will He help for sure? - Yes, if your faith is real! I see. Come all ye whose sacks are empty... I will grind you grain. Free, no payment... Me! Me, me! Blessed are they who have faith. Though they know not what they shall receive. Tobias, put your sack under the chute! Let it come down! Enough, good Lord... Enough! God! What's in the sack? It's God's mill that grinds out the women too. Dear friends in Christ! Matrimony was instituted by God! Now the two of you hold your sack! Bread... Give us bread... Give us bread...bread...bread... Damn it all! My Lord, my Lord, I didn't get any flour! Damn it! Topi, why don't you go to the big bin? - Where is that? - It's over there. This is empty! Totally empty! I told you: this is what the poor man's mill is like. Give me light! In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Topi, what's the matter? Don't shout like that! Don't kick around like that... Are you asleep or what? I wonder if he is well, moaning and tossing about like that. If he went and died, we'd be in real trouble. He'll have to go and get grain. And there aren't many potatoes left! We ought to get something for the children to wear. And I'm in rags myself. Not a blouse or a skirt in nine years. What was Topi thinking when we set up home? He hasn't gotten me one decent dress. My wedding dress is in rags, fit only for milking cows. I wonder if I'll ever get a new Sunday dress again. Why should I have such thoughts? It's a sin! Take away the bad word Take away the sin of vanity Stupid preening, take away Silks and velvets, take away Like wind, blowing in vain - Are you going or what? - Must be on my way. - Won't get there by nightfall. - I'll stay the night at Selkoskylä. Are you buying on credit? The grain? Don't know about credit. Depends on what I get for those birds. You got something saved up? Ought to be enough to get something for gruel without credit. Where did you hide them? In the old pothole. No wonder the dog was nosing around. How will you take them? I'll take a dozen with me and leave the rest for next time. We went skiing! Close the door! - Going to the parsonage? - Why would I? They might have some spinning for me. - I'll stop by, then. - Wait a moment! Step aside. Buy some red cretonne for Iita Linta Maria. - The one you saw at midsummer. - I'll do that. Where did you get all this money? That Russian peddler paid for board and lodging. That's a good cow we've got. - Come on, boys. - Come and see Daddy off! Will we have some coffee at our place this Christmas? Now, Riika! Take care. Keep the children from the fire! Go inside and look through the window to see Daddy leave. - Keep well! - Keep well! This devilish system must come to an end! The poor must rise to defend the interests and their rights! The poor people in the country must be ready at the elections. They must elect representatives who will help them. The rich have finally been forced to give poor people the vote. The government of our masters must become a government by the people. Every poor man and woman must learn about the new electoral law! They must learn the importance of the red line drawn by the poor. Dear friends and comrades! That red line flows from the lifeblood of the Finnish people. As true as there is a God and the masters have a master, the red line will tear out the vitals of the people's oppressors! That's the way it will be! The red line will be drawn in this village too this winter. That's right! We'll make our weight felt! - Hello to you. - Hello. - Well, any news? - Just about the same... It's winter again. I've brought greetings. Thanks! The greetings of poor folk come from the heart! Have you come to get grain? Well... I had to! It's easy to see! - Have some coffee. - Thank you! What book were you reading from? It was the newspaper "Power of the People". I'll give you some old issues. No, our walls can make do without any wallpaper. Well, don't you live in a cave! She is giving them to you for you to read, not for the roaches to eat... They seem to be prophesying the Last Judgment. My blood stood still when she read the words! So even the squirrel-dog is on the fox's trail. - Don't forget to come to the meeting! - What meeting? So the message hasn't reached you? It's the meeting of the Social Mocrats! It's at merchant Visuliini's place this evening at 7. Is it the pastor or the sheriff who is holding it? - Not even the sexton dare come! - Who is holding it then? The tailor and me! From the next March 15th, things in this world will take another turn. You can draw a red line. And so can Riika. So that's the new law! But maybe it is so that Topi and Riika can't vote. - Unless you paid last year's taxes? - Not yet. Then you won't draw any red line! But there's still time to pay your taxes. What with? It's a rich man's law when the poor have to pay before voting! This winter we have to pay our taxes, wherever the money is from. Next winter we'll make the laws and the poor won't pay any taxes! That's the way! I have money for the taxes, but how will I get food? The poor must eat acorns now, so they can get bread later! The dog is coming! And Daddy! Take it, and put the pan on the fire. Do you have coffee? Enough for today and Christmas. Kunilla sent it. - Sent her regards. - Thank you! And sugar? - I bought a little. - Thank you! I was at a meeting. The rich are going to be dancing with rage. In this country. You see... Well now... It was... - Well, what? - How can I put it? - Come on. Out with it! - Socioli...crazy...! What kind of meeting were you really at? - It was at Visuliini's. - Who held it? - Kalle the tailor and Kunilla. - The tailor, the cobbler! Are you out of your wits? I always got my wits about me! Wouldn't know about you! - Who else was there? - Just ordinary people. - Not even the sexton? - No sexton! No singing? Kalle and Kunilla sang out of a red psalm book! - Is that so! - Why should I lie about it? Was it our psalms they sang? No, they weren't Lutheran ones. They were different! Dear Lord! The Interenal was what Kalle called those psalms! It was a crazy idea to hold a meeting like that. Why did you get mixed up in goings-on like that? A new law is coming now, so that even little people can give a Red vote! Where do such new ways of doing things come from, then? - It's from the Czar. - Who told you? - The cobbler and the tailor! - A cobbler and a tailor! - And what about that red line? - The women can draw one too! - You are lying! - Go and find out for yourself! I'm not going to any heathens' meetings! They'll be needing you in March! - Who will? - Well, the Socialorat! Tell me why women must go! What's it good for? Tailor Kalle said so at the meeting! Take the word to every cabin! Especially to the lowliest ones. Because everybody in need must come to vote for their spokesmen and get rid of their misery. Misery... Is that what the tailor said? Sounds very pretty, if you remember it the way he said it! Yes, I do! - And other women are going? - I hear they are! Everybody will have a vote! That is, if they are twenty-four years old. But in December, I will be thirty-three! You can still draw the red line! The tailor said so when I pulled his sleeve and asked him! The cobbler is a learned man... But the tailor is even more learned when it comes to the law! The cobbler said we couldn't vote because we hadn't paid our taxes. But the tailor told me to get a paper showing want-of-means. I got it and our names are on the voting rolls! It's about time that justice was shared out in this parish too. They have been lording it and gnawing the ribs of the poor. I wonder if these forests are really crown property. I could clear some land and sell the logs and tar! Then a little man like me could eat bread and not tree-bark. And are all those churchmen really put in authority by God? Now, now! Did you stop by the parsonage? - I didn't dare. - Good thing you didn't. - I had a dream about it. - What do women's dreams mean! And I got something else on credit than the cloth. It stopped the pack from cutting into my shoulders. - Here! - Who did you bring this for? This checked stuff won't even do for pants for the boys! You can wear it when we go to draw our red line in March. And you can wear it at other times too. Now I am a... Don't try to say the word when you don't know how. Socialo...rate... Now if the hub of this world was only greased anew. Then it would spin at a different speed. If only the law would protect the poor man's back and not just the rich man's stomach. I hear there are such fine houses out there in the world that the poor can't even dream of them! There they dine on pork and syrup. And eat out of shiny gilded bowls with silver spoons. And they drink fine wines! The price of a glassful would keep a poor man's family a whole week! The womenfolk there have fingers covered in gold rings. And their breasts glitter with sparkling gems. Their price would support all the people of this town! The young ladies there bathe in pure cream and full milk, like gnats in a jug of clabber! I wonder if that sort of living might be coming to an end? The rich buy women's flesh like a logger buys American bacon! With their riches they can engage in all manner of debauchery. The priests and the bishops cannot raise a finger against it. For the jingle of money they will bless the sinner's body. And send his spirit to Heaven although it belongs in Hell! At every bend in the path the poor have been elbowed aside! Just go to the landlord and ask to loan a pound of flour. He'll sneer and say he won't for a bunch of peasant riff-raff. You go and see the sheriff's man and he'll say he hasn't the time. The gentry have come and the toddy is being drunk. Or he's going out fishing together with wife and sons. But for farmers with ten cows the sheriff's man is all smiles! And invites them to his house for some hot toddy. But that about God not being the true guardian of the poor... That's something my mind shies away from. That a Lord as great as He should be dragged from His throne. I think a swindler is one thing, he deserves to be thrown away, but the Lord of Heaven is another case! A Lord like Him won't fall at the hand of a cobbler's wife! The Maker of Man has the powers to stay in office. But He should be told kindly to start looking after the poor! The lands and the goods of the world should be redivided. And the taxes and fees no longer laid on the poor. The parish should subsidize the poor for their children. A pharmacy should be built in the center of every village! And medicine should be given free to the sick. And the Crown should build the bridges and highways. And I'll also vote for adequate railroads! For a railroad to run past my place and over the border. Hey, busy-boots! Are you coming or not? When I get the sled mended! What a great Christmas we'll have! Not a stitch of new clothing! And where can the soap be? Damn this life! Living the life of a wet rag! The food is running out for man and beast alike. The pig and sheep had better be slaughtered by Twelfth Night. Can't keep them alive on twigs! They're trying to eat my fingers to the bone. Topi, aren't you coming? I'm hurrying! Break a hole in the ice! You've got the ice-pick! - Pull steadily! - I am pulling! Hey, listen... Come out of that smoke! Couldn't we drink the rest of the coffee tonight? And what do we do tomorrow? Eat snow? But it's Christmas Eve. And I have such a craving! Right now, elsewhere in the world they're stuffing themselves. What is it now? Why must we be so miserable and want for everything? There's not a single clean shirt for the children after the sauna. - Or for you, either. - A dirty shirt is fine for me. Riika, don't worry, this may be the last time things are like this! - The last time? - I can see it! You really believe that the world will be turned on its head? - Yes, I do! - By that red line? By that and by socio... ah... socioracy! Go and make the coffee! What are you doing, Daddy? Milling the coffee beans! - Where did you get them? - From the village cobbler. - Where did the cobbler get it? - From the storekeeper! - Where did the storekeeper get it? - A town far away! - Is it sweet? - It tastes bad. - Let me taste some. - Well then... - Is it good? - Bad! - Only sugar is sweet! - Yes it is. Taste some! - Christmas is coming. - Where is it coming from? - Is it coming on skis? - Has it been here before? Is it coming only after Ma and Pa have drunk their coffee? Er, well... - Mom, look, sugar! - Sugar? I see. Did you father give you that? I should make some porridge! They've got to fill their bellies. But there isn't much to put in the pot. Now the Christmas candle is burning in the parsonage. And at the forester's and at the sheriff's office. Mother, why don't we have a Christmas candle? We haven't got any! We could hang a spill on one of the branches. Oh Lord, those children! One day we will have a Christmas tree with candles! Jysky is barking! Bow wow, bow wow! Quiet now! Quiet down! Who's there? Just a Christian! Oh, it's Simana! Come inside where it's warm! Greetings to you all! Hello to everyone in the house! - And hello to you, too! - Hello! Can you put up a traveler? Of course! And you're just in time for the sauna. Spasibo, my friend! What a reception! To a traveler, a bath is like gold! The cobbler and his wife send their regards! They asked me which way I was traveling. I told I was coming this way. They sent you something. I've got it in my pack. There you go... They're nice people. They sent you a book. And there's a meeting they say you must go to! - A meeting I must go to? - You must! What a reception for me! A hot and steaming sauna. A chance to stretch my aching bones, my tortured torso... Red-haired maiden, blond-haired maiden, tell me, will you, tell me, will you, when are the suitors coming our way, coming our way? Red-haired maiden, blond-haired maiden, tell me, will you, tell me, will you when are the suitors coming our way, coming our way? And now to the sauna! C...I...T... "Cit"? Are they telling me to sit or what? Listen... My eyes can't read in this light! "Citizen's Election Guide". I should have guessed that it would be about the Socialorat... F...I...N... I can't make any word out of this! The steam must have gotten in my eyes! The steam, is it? Aren't married folk supposed to help each other! What does it say? Oh well... "Finland, Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire..." "The country's parliament represents all the people of Finland..." So that's what it says! Read on a bit more, will you? "The Parliament has a single chamber." "It has two hundred representatives." Just one chamber! Like the pastor's chicken house! "The representatives can be voted for by every Finnish citizen, both men and women." There, now you've seen for yourself! You can read more when it's daylight. Now do you believe me? I guess I have to believe the printed word! Spasibo to the one who heated the bath, the one who brought the water, the one who sealed the sauna, the one who chopped the logs, the one who lit the fire, the one who threw in the wood! Spasibo, thank you to everyone! The steam is sweet and good. Is there still some hot water? We can make some tea! Now let's see what I have in my pack. Everything that's nice. There are things and other things, buttons. And cockroach poison. And asafetida, known as the devil's dung. One man said I was selling bad devil's dung. I told him that the devil ran short of food last year. He only had bread made of bark. So how could his dung be any good? Well, indeed! Drink your tea now! It's good tea, drink it. Drink! There you go. Now that the women have the right to vote, you can look after the house while I go to the meetings. Might be a good idea if she went along. She might help to make things clear to me! Riika's got as good a head on her shoulders as I have. Even the best brain gets rusty if you lose touch with people. We'll have to get Kaisa to come and mind the house. - Hello. - Hello there. So you're going to the meeting of those raging people? Give my regards to the tailor. Tell him I believe in healing. They all need to be bled! It would take the pressure off their brains! That's what Forsström's widow says. She says arrogance can flow over, even among Christians. Then there's no cure except bleeding and the Word of God. Well, go on then. And don't forget my tobacco! - For making me mind your brats! - I'll get you some. That's the state the world's in! I don't mind if the Sociocrates come to Finland. They can divide the forest and the land by a count of heads! What are you saying? So the word hasn't reached your place yet? Sure, Topi has been talking about it. But the name. What is it really? It's Socialistmocracy. Some kind of foreign dialect. Oh, foreign? So that's why Topi has trouble learning it. Are you going to the people's meeting? There'll be enough people there without me. Though they tell me the wives are going there too. The Prince of Darkness is on the prowl to seize souls for Satan's kingdom. The Fiend is on the prowl. The Devil always finds new wiles to trap the weak. Beware of these new wiles! Beware, I say, of the evil spirit of these days! That evil spirit which is arriving in our parish. Satan is the father of that spirit! Lord's Apostle Paul commanded once the evil spirit to leave him. His words should be yours when they tempt you with this evil! POOR PEOPLE'S MEETING HERE. SPEAKER FROM THE PARTY. Once we get the boat out, we can pay a little visit there... - Where did the speaker come from? - From Helsinki. Let us first sing the International. Not sure if all know it. You know it, comrades! Arise, you prisoners of starvation Arise, you wretched of the earth For justice thunders condemnation A better world's in birth No more tradition's chains will bind us Arise, you slaves, no more in thrall! The earth shall rise on new foundations We have been naught, we shall be all! 'Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The International union shall be the human race 'Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The International union shall be the human race! We want no condescending saviors To rule us from their judgment hall We workers ask not for their favors Let us consult for all To make the thief discharge his booty To free the spirit from its cell We must ourselves decide our duty We must decide and do it well! 'Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The International union shall be the human race 'Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The International union shall be the human race! Brothers and sisters in ideology! Among you has arrived an enemy of the power of church and clergy, of officialdom, of riches and the power of the sword. An enemy of all the devilish powers you can imagine! I am that enemy! Look at me! Listen to what I have to say! I was sent here by the organized proletariat party of Finland. Not by any secret gang of the rich! Just laugh, you members of the ruling class. I don't know you and have no wish to do so! Listen to a true social democrat condemn and reveal your evil intents! I know your party has tried to find sins to reveal in our party. You have failed to do so! These poor people have been bowing and scraping before you! Now it's our turn to enter the battleground. We have the power! We will beat down the oppressors! We fear not their armed might! Tremble, you masters of deceit! The people will condemn your pillage and your butchery. The day of vengeance is dawning and justice is coming! We demand humanity and will get it peacefully or by force! Who ploughs the fields and digs the ditches in this parish? Who digs the wells and toils in the dirt? Who sleeps in the rain under the open sky? Who draws in the fishing nets with frozen hands at the icy shore? Who skis in the blizzard and the dark? Who roots out the tree stumps? Who hauls the tar barrels and rows for hundreds of miles on a starvation wage? Who keeps the officials, the middle class and the idlers alive? Who keeps the gluttons and the drunkards in food and drink and suffers from want? Is it not the proletariat? All those who toil! Who in this parish keeps the money going? Who toils unwittingly for the capitalists, so that others may enjoy themselves, flaunt in finery and live in lust? Who in this parish launders the lace that clothes the haughty? Who shovels the dung? Who harnesses the horses for the rich? Who rinses out the laundry in a freezing hole in the ice? Who scrubs the backsides of the gentry in a hellish-hot sauna? Is it not the poor? The proletariat! Or do you believe God has ordained it so? I have come to this parish to bring you enlightenment. The pastor in the church is lying that slaves should be humble and allows the masters to revel at their will. The pastor is lying! We Social Democrats know that Man was created free. Everyone has the right to bread, to land, to comfort and even to enjoyment! Nobody was created to kiss the rod! Nobody was created to clear the land with calloused hands so that the bourgeoisie could be idle, dressed in broadcloth and velvet and drinking sweet wines! The God he preaches about and commands you to bow is a Golden Calf invented by the capitalists! The kind that's told of in the Old Testament! It will not serve as a God of the poor, my brothers and sisters! Religion is a holy matter. But the poor must give up the faith of the rich. They must find the Kingdom of God with their own strength! We have been reared like sheep in a pen! We must learn to beware of injustice and deceit! No longer shall the lash of hunger and slavery crack here! The poor must snatch it, like a dog snatches the stick it's beaten with. Those fat-salaried folk who look down on the working man and woman, who flay the worker's hide, should know the vengeance of the Living God... Just a minute! Just a minute, Mr. Chairman. I apologize... But I must interrupt the worthy chairman of this meeting. I feel that every phrase of his serves but to spoil a good cause. His speech serves but to banish what should never be banished. I mean common sense. True, I am a teacher at the State Church here. I understand why our profession is under attack. I admit there is a great deal of reason in the attacks... I speak as a human being, not as a salaried minister. I don't belong to any party, nor do I want to. Good friends... Think what will come of people being incited to hatred! For that is what this agitator is doing. He seems to think this is the best way to make his point. It could all be explained quite calmly. Discuss the election law and social democracy peacefully. Out, dammit! I apologize once again for disturbing your meeting. But I want you all to ponder in your hearts which is more blissful: hatred or love? Vengeance or forgiveness? Dispute or harmony? The teacher of mankind says: He who takes up the sword, shall perish by the sword. I hope that social democracy will take a different course, not the course described by your speaker. From the bottom of my heart I wish good fortune to the cause of the poor! But I cannot approve hatred being whipped up. Neither can any true socialist. For it is heathenish! It will bring yet more suffering to this suffering country, whether you believe it or not! Did you see? Did you hear? Do you believe now? That's what they're like! They creep into every place. They sniff every corner. They have no shame, no sense of honor! They wish to seal up the people's mouths and nostrils. But if one of us tugs at their hems when they are in the pulpit, off to jail with him on the spot! That priest's apprentice sat here like a gendarme, prying and spying, the provocateur, the informant! But he did not dare speak long nor argue about God! He dared not to stay till the end of the meeting. He left when it got so hot that it burned his backside! I let him speak on purpose to dry his gall! Dear comrades, brothers and sisters! Fear nothing! If you'd have more newspapers to read, you'd know the tide of democracy is rising. The crown officials and the saber-bearing police do not break up meetings here the way they do in Russia! The proletariat has freedom of speech now! And the poor people can speak their mind! And I speak with the permission of the people. I speak about the true cause! Whoever cannot listen to the truth, let him be gone like that priest! That's how things are, comrades! Miserable is the life of the downtrodden. I have seen misery everywhere I have traveled. But never before have I seen such misery as in these parts... Many of the cabins have worse food than in prison cells! Hundreds of cottages are dirtier than pig-sties. I spent Monday night in a neighboring parish. In a cabin where the only food was bark-bread and stale sourmilk! I am not lying! The children were stark naked! Grandfather sat in the corner, diseased and uncared for. The man had cut off his foot with an axe... And the wife was in a blessed state! The chilly stove was broken, windows were stuffed with straw. I shivered and wept and could not sleep all night! Yet that parish was said to have a rich pastor who had no mercy but collected his dues to the last penny! And took the family's only cow if they had no money! Good God in Heaven, I thought. When will this end? As everyone knows, the elections will be held on March 15th. If you wish to support the cause of the poor, put a stoke opposite the Social Democrat list! The pastor left the room, because he had no answers. That speaker put the record straight! - The pastor left and didn't return. - Didn't he say a thing? The agitator really showed that pastor what's what. The International union shall be the human race! When is it beginning? - When will what begin? - The election! March 15th! Will an old man like me get to vote? I'm already 96 years of age! There's no age limit! How do you make that red line? With your thumb! It won't leave a mark! Press so hard that the blood will run! What if it won't? It's got to! Nothing else will beat them. Just nick your thumb with a knife. That ain't forbidden, is it? No, there's no paragraph about thumbs! Drawing that red line, it's like drinking the blood of Christ at the communion. It might bring ruin and everlasting death, or maybe blessing and happiness all life long. - Do we dare to draw it at all? - Yes, we have to! Power to the people! The laws were made to oppress! The rich get all the money! The poor get all the poverty! Isn't this all true? The poor must be given security in sickness, injury and old age! Drinking must be prohibited! Oppressor laws must be repealed. And all the rulers... Down with the rule of the few! Justice for the down-trodden! Free election days throughout the land! Today is the day! Take your glasses with you! Stay behind! Got to keep my wits about me! Just like in bear hunting. I hope my poor head can stand it. Well, if the womenfolk can stand it, so can I! Move along now! I'll draw that red line real thick and heavy. The Czar will see how mad Finnish women get when they're hungry! And I'm going to put my initials on it, no matter what the Constitution says. They'll see that we mean business in these parts! Remember not to push ahead of me when we go to the election! I'll make my mark first, and you do it afterwards. I'll explain to you the way to behave. - You mustn't talk there! - Then I'll wink to you! Wink to me, will you? THE POOR WILL HAVE THE POWER! It's not our strength of will alone That drives to make our ideals known But also care for our dear land, The happiness of our dear land! Ah, new comrades! Welcome! - Have you cast your vote? - Not yet! Not yet? I'll take you to the polling station... Go on into the room. There's plenty of space! Have some coffee, comrades, before you go in the name of the almighty people! Hey, look at that! Wonder if he'll be showing off so much next year? The squire will get skinny when they take his bottle away! - Who's that man with glasses? - That's the new forester! He gets six thousand to stop the poor from gathering wood. But will he be doing it next year? - Ready to go? - If you could sing a little first? What's it to be? That...that Internal, maybe. Here we go! Arise, you prisoners of starvation, Arise, you wretched of the earth For justice thunders condemnation, A better world's in birth No more tradition's chains will bind us... ...the International union shall be the human race! - Shall we go now? - Yes. POLLING STATION Tobias Tobiaanpoika Romppanen? Don't you know me? - Wife, Fredrika Euphrosyne. - Maiden name Juntunen! The womenfolk's own names don't matter here. Go into the next room! Come this way. Can you manage on your own or should I give you a hand? I can find the number without help from the masters! You can go in there. Number 30... Social Crazy... The last tricks of the enemy! I won't let them get away with it! Don't you be handling Crown property so roughly! That line ought to be seen! Can a poor woman go now? There's one door for poor and rich alike! - Apostles of that world reformer! - That's so for sure! The way they insisted on marking the ballot themselves! Those women have a lot of strength in their arms. Sharpen the pencil, please! Did you see the sweat running down his face? He was trembling in his pants! Shh! More cattle coming in. How long will you be staying at the logging camp? A couple of weeks or so. Boys, give your mother a hand! - You'll send us help soon? - Yes, I will! Coffee and sugar, too. And candy for the children. - Goodbye now! - Goodbye and take care! Soon there'll be other help, when they count all those votes! Yes... Let's see Daddy off! Today... Today he will come! The one who brings help and banishes misery. He didn't come today. Today. He must be coming today. Didn't they see it was drawn with the heart's blood of the poor? Won't they come true, the predictions? The white bread and porridge and pork fat were to come, in a flash! Untorn shirts and picture books for the children! All those wonderful changes, after drawing the red line. Why don't they come? They will when the time is right. Just wait patiently, keep believing. The road from Petersburg is long! Many a mile to Helsinki and here. What is it? Aren't you well? My dear child... Are you sick? What is it with my little one? Mother will put you to sleep. Lie down now! Mother will make you some gruel. Boys, don't cry! Summer is coming. Your heads will get better, your throats and bellies too! Nothing to worry about! Lie down on the bench. Mother will make you some gruel. Was it God or a bad spirit who sent the disease? Illness and sickness come from the rich, the oppressors! They do not care of the sickness or death of the poor! For to them the poor are not people! I don't know what to believe, living out here in the forest. It must be our masters' fault. Children can't be cured in misery. Perhaps drawing that red line was counted as a sin? Now the punishment is coming! Topi and I were so proud on that election day. Didn't even say hello to the sheriff. If I could only go to Kettuvaara to get some help. Lord Jesus bless us! Why put them into the world when I can't care for them? I couldn't handle the sorrow if... What are these sicknesses, Kaisa? I would think they are contaminations of heresy! - You mean Social Democracy? - That's right! God will not let Himself be mocked! Doomsday's might is terrifying It will make your heartstrings bend Everyone will end up dying The whole world will come to end Everyone will shake with fear When the Judge is getting near Heaven's trumpet blasts its sound Through the world it sends its waves Even deep under the ground Raising the dead from their graves Ready for the Judgment Day... God can sometimes be harsh. He brings his straying sheep back to the fold so they won't kick against the powers that be. Three children... How much will it cost? By law 50 pennies a head. But we will make it one mark since they are in one coffin. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Jesus Christ, our Savior, will raise thee on the Last Day. Our party will win a crushing victory! The ruling classes will come crashing to the ground. It's the masters that are to blame for the death of your children. If there had been money and doctors, they wouldn't have died like puppies. Topi! Topi, hey! Topi! Retail subtitles revised by Veikko for KG
