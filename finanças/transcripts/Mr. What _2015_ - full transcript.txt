- Mr. What, time to go. Go ahead and step to the gate. - I'll see you inside, Jim. Hey! Hey! - How do you do, Mr. Officer? - Make that detective Smith. What's your name? - Mr. What. - Yeah mister, what's your name? - That's what I go by. - What do you mean? - Well, you go by Mr. officer sometimes, right? - Yeah, I get called that sometimes. So? - So I go by Mr. What. - I want your real name right now. - You won't understand it if I say it. - Try me. - Okay. Madiasco kaappoo wuopio. - What? - That's right. What is much easier. - What nationality is that? - Finn. - Sounds Chinese to me. - What may be Chinese, but wuopio is Finnish. In fact, my middle name kaappoo translates god's messenger. - God's messenger? I don't see any wings on you. I think I'll just take you in. - Why? - Get to the bottom of why you're being so evasive. I'll tell you what, I want you to write down your name and address. - Well, I don't live here. - Where do you live? - Jackson. - What are you doing in tecumseh? - I hitch-hike here once a month from Jackson. This time around I'm looking for a place to stay a little longer. - You running from something? - Not lately. - Mattisku-kapu-wupu... - nice try. Feel free to call me Mr. What. - You're a pretty weird guy. Well, that doesn't make you a criminal but... I know I shouldn't do this but I got a niece that acts just as weird as you do. She's got a place over on standish pond for rent. She could use a renter. Her name is derlyze Fisher. It's a good place for peace and quiet. Here's her card. - Good to know. Thanks. - Just so you know, I'll be keeping a close eye on you. - Adios! - Can I bring you anything else? - No, I'm good. That really hit the spot. One thing you might tell me is is water street somewhere this direction? - Yes, it is. If you go down Evans, take a left, and you'll find water street. - Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. - Come back again. - I will. - Mommy, Herman won't leave me alone. - She's reacting in an overly emotional manner as usual! - I'm not motional. - Both of you cool your jets. - But he's scary with those teeth. - Chill out Herman! - Can I help you? - Are you derlyze Fisher? - I am. - Well your uncle gave me your card and said you've got a house for rent. - You know uncle Jimmy then? - Sort of. - Cool. Well the house is right next door and I live here. This is my mom and dad's place. They're out of town in new Mexico for a while helping out my grandparents. They're going through some tough old age stuff. - I know all about that stuff. - Yeah? Well, the house is 600 a month. - Could I rent it one week at a time? - Man, I don't know about that. - Well, I've got enough cash for one week right here. And I could mow the lawn, clean the place, paint. I'm a good carpenter. So I can work every week to cover that week's rent. - All right, well under those terms, I'll promise you two weeks. You can pay for this week, I'll have some work for you to do next week, and then we'll just see after that. - It's a deal. - All right, cool. I'll show you the place. Heather, stay here with Herman. I'll be right back. No more spazzing, you two. You play the guitar? - Just picked it back up after many years. - That's cool. Hey, by the way, if you see a big brown dog around here with a red collar, keep your distance. Let me know. It's homeless. It's mean. The cops want it caught. - Okay. - All right. - Mommy! - I hear them over there. I've gotta go see what's going on, so here's the key. Let yourself in. Everything else is self explanatory, and I'll see you soon. - Okay. Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - Home sweet home. Nice. Oh, yeah! Huh. It works. - Hello? Hello? - Hi. - Hi. I'm Herman. I know, it sucks. - Have a seat. Sit down there. - Unfortunately for me, my mom's favorite band from the 60's was Herman's hermits, and they sang I'm Henry the eighth I am. - I remember that. - Yeah, I wish she would have liked Rick Springfield or Bo diddley maybe. - Yeah. Rick Fisher would sound pretty good all right. - Yeah. - I like Bo Fisher. How about if I call you Bo. - That would be awesome! - Okay. Bo it is. My name's Mr. What. - Mr. What's your real name? - No. My real name is madiasco. I know. It sucks. - Um, there's food in the bag from our fridge. My mom just wanted to get you started. - That's nice of her. - Not so much. She was just making sure that you weren't stealing anything. - Nothing yet. But you know, who's to stop me from taking off at 3f00 in the morning with everything I can carry. - Beats me. I think she thought if I left, Heather would stop bawling. She's afraid of my new look. - What's the story behind your new look? - Well I was playing baseball with the neighborhood kids. They made me be catcher. It was going good until Ronnie cubberly was, he was up to bat and he missed the pitch and threw the bat into my face. - Huh. How bad was it? - Um, fractured my cheek bone. I lost two teeth. And I hurt my jaw. - Wow. That's bad. - We're at 40,000 and still counting. - Any insurance? - No. I don't know what my mom's gonna do. We put our house up for sale last week. - I saw that. - Yeah. - Huh. Where's your father? - He left and I'm glad. - Why? - Because he was mean. Well, I better get going. Mom said not to stay. - Thanks a lot, Bo, for the groceries. - Yep. Jerry's market's close by. Go out to the light, turn left across the bridge. - Got you, Bo. - Don't steal anything, okay Mr. What. - Don't do what? - Don't steal anything. - Tell your mother I'm already gone and the TV's missing. - I'll do. - All right. - See you. - Bye. - Oh, so this is what you're running from, madiasco. No wonder you was so evasive. I thought so. - Hi, Naomi. Is it okay if I visit with my father? - Madiasco, perfect timing! Come on in. He's in the living room in his chair. Basilius! Madiasco is here to see you. - Oh, it's Wilhelm! I've been waiting for you. - Father. Good to see you. - Wilhelm, my brother. - No, it's madiasco. - Please have a seat. Sit down. - Okay. Thanks Naomi. - How is things on the farm? - Things are good. - Good crops this year? - Yes, father. Good crops. - I love the birds. They told me you were coming. - I love you, father. - I love the birds. Don't you? - They're beautiful. - Remember the battle of the bulge, Wilhelm? We were there. Um, 1942, was it? - It was 1944 and 45. You and your brother. - I had a son in 1950. Named him tahvo. - Madiasco. You named him madiasco. - Tahvo was a bad boy. He brought great grief to his mother. She cries every day. - Mom has passed away two years ago. - She's in there crying now. Fernanda, come out and see Wilhelm. - Listen to me, father. Listen. I'm madiasco, and I'm innocent. They found me innocent. Understand? They caught the real guy, the bad guy, and it wasn't me. They let me go a few months ago, so dad, you can be proud of me again. You can be proud of me. I'm madiasco and I'm innocent. Dad. - Fernanda cries all the time. She's crying now. Fernanda's crying. I should go and look in on her. - Dad. - She's been alone too long. Fernanda's crying. She needs me. Fernanda needs me now! - It's okay. - Now! - Everything's okay. Naomi, please come. You're okay. You're all right. Everything's fine. - Did you have a nice talk? - Yes, we did. Thanks for taking care of him. - Well, it's the least I could do. Your mother was such a good friend of mine for 40 years, and I do worry though that the dementia might be getting worse. It's really tough, and I think we're gonna have to think about a nursing home very, very soon. - I love you. Everything's okay. Everything's all right. It's okay. - You know, madiasco, it was so nice to see you again, and I am just so glad that you're free. - Thanks for everything. I'll see you again soon okay? - Already looking forward to it. - Thank you. God bless. Adios! - Help me, Jesus. - Hello detective Smith. - Can I come in? - I guess. - Madiasco wuopio. - You worked it out. - Yeah. Prisoner 5676713. Released from cotton correctional facility in Jackson three months ago after serving 22 years. For aggravated robbery with a dangerous weapon. - Yeah, well, if you did all the research you saw that the key witness who perjured himself against me finally told the investigator the truth, and that led the defense attorney and the prosecutors to a career criminal who, by the way, confessed. - That's right. New DNA corroborated everything, and the attorneys petitioned a court on your behalf, but it still took them months to let you out. - Tell me about it. It was a complete miscarriage of justice. I'm innocent. But they did all this to me, and they ruined my life. - Well, now you're living in my step brother's house next to my niece and her kids. I'm not sure I like that. - I'm an innocent man. - Yeah, of one particular crime. But you've been in prison for 22 years with dangerous felons. You're bitter, you've been wronged. I think probably prison may have changed you, maybe given you a hard heart. If you don't have a job, you don't have a home, you have no money. Derlyze told me you don't have enough money to make first month's rent. And now you're tied in with my relatives. - You're the one who connected us. - Yeah. That was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. - I haven't done anything wrong at all but I'm guilty, right? - Tell me one thing. What are you gonna do for money? - The only guy who believed in my innocence from day one lives in south bend, Indiana. I just talked to him on the kitchen phone a little bit ago. He's sending me a check to this address for $200 dollars. That will buy me some food, buy me some time, so guess what? I won't even have to Rob a bank for the next week. - Oh, real funny. We'll see what derlyze says after the first week. Have a good night, Mr. What. - Mom, he's out there again. - What's he doing? - I'll go check. - Don't let him see you. I don't want him to think we're spying on him. - Okay. - Come on out, Bo. I know you're there. Are you spying on me? - My mother made me. - Uh-huh. What else you got planned for today? - Nothing much, playing with Heather, cleaning my room, lunch. And more spying, I'm sure. - You got some buddies in the neighborhood? - No, you're the closest thing. - Me? - Everyone else around here either calls me names or ignores me. - Herman, I need you home. - Doing what? - Just, I need you home, that's all. - Okay, you heard her. Gotta go plan for the next covert operation. - I'll get a little sneakier for a bigger challenge and make it more interesting. - I'd appreciate it. ♪ He don't remember all the little things... ♪ The best times of his life... ♪ He can't say how it all just slipped away... ♪ He don't recall just where he put his uncle Henry ♪ pocket knife... ♪ He don't know if it's January, march, or may... ♪ I'm talking about my father... ♪ I'm talking about my daddy... ♪ I'm talking about the one I love the most... ♪ Now I've turned into a ghost... ♪ He don't know who I am... ♪ He don't know I'm the lucky man... ♪ Holding his memories and his hand in my hand... ♪ Holding his memories and his hand in my hand... ♪ Holding his memories... - Step back.

I've been in prison for 22 years for a crime I didn't commit. I'd say that makes me one of the unluckiest people on the planet. - True, but you are getting out of this pothole. What's you got waiting for you out there? - My guess is nothing but trouble. It's going to be impossible to get a job. I've got 22 years with no work experience. - Yeah, but you made license plates, and a lot of 'em. - Well, maybe I qualify to work in an auto manufacturing plant. - Well, if you get a job with Chevy or Ford, let 'em know about me in about four years. - You got it. - Good dog.

He'll beat you down! - Are you all right? - Ahh. They hit like little girls. - Well, hold still. - Just what do you think you're doing to my son? - I just tripped and fell, mom. He's brushing me off. - That's weird. - No, it's not. I wanted him to. - All right, well, thanks, I guess. Herman, go inside the house. I know you're doing a lots around here to impress me, but let me assure you I don't impress easily. And if you do anything at all to negatively influence my son, you'll be gone in a minute. Hold on. Hello? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, I'll ask him. He's standing right here in my yard. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'll ask him. I will tell him. Yep, bye. That was sondra Burnett, my neighbor. Her boy told her that you were threatening him with a broom. Is that true? It sure looks like it. - You mean this? - You look guilty. - A lot of people have said that to me. - She also said that her boy and Herman got into a fight. Is that true? - Not exactly. Ask Herman. - I'm asking you. - Not exactly. - Okay, if you do anything to cause me to fight with my neighbors, it's not going to be all right, you understand? - I'll try my best, Mrs. Fisher. - Or your minute will be up. - So this is what freedom feels like. - Awesome!

Bye, Naomi. - Hey, Mr. What, what are you doing? - I bought some groceries. - Can I carry that? - Sure, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. - Yup. - So what's new with you? - I know a lot about horses. - You do? - Yeah, all about Mr. What. - Mr. What? - 1968 ... no, 1958. Mr. What was a horse running in the grand national steeple chase run in england. There were 30 jumps in more than four miles. - I didn't know that. - They call it the ultimate test for a horse and jockey, and Mr. What won by 30 lengths. - Wow, mighty interesting. - Yeah, I wish I was a winner. - You are! I think you're a winner for sure. - You do? - Absolutely positively. I know a winner when I see one. - You do? - Sure. - Well, how can you tell? - Well, first I look straight into the person's eyes. - What do you look for? - Sparkle. - Do I have a sparkle? - A big one. Secondly, I look deep into the heart. - The heart? - Yes, there's the ultimate test. - But you can't see someone's heart, can you? - Yes, I can. The condition of your heart reveals itself through three things, three attributes. - What are they? - Faith, hope, and love. The great of these is love. - So those things make you a winner? - They sure do, absolutely no doubt about it. - Oh. I'm glad I'm a winner. - Yes, you are a winner. You sure live in a noisy neighborhood, man. Cars, and lawn mowers, crazy. - Heather. - Heather. - Did you see that airplane? - Yeah, I sure did. You know what? When I was walking into town the other day, I got right underneath those planes, and I flew, flew right in over my head. - Well, that's mighty interesting. - You're a good guy, man. You're a winner. - Thanks, don't you ever forget it, all right? - I won't. - Anybody that comes and helps carry my groceries like you do, believe me, they're really a nice guy. - Herman, come home. - Okay, mom. Here you go, Mr. What. - Hit me a high five first. Yeah, thanks for the help, Bo. - Yep, no problem. - Nice talking with you. - Nice talking with you, too. - Stop! I said stop! Next time, you better listen to me, you hear me? - Stop it, Terry! Get off of him! Get off of him! - I'll show you who's boss, you little jerk! - I said get off of him and leave him alone! - You're nothing, you hear me, nothing! Aghhhh! - You all right? - Do I look all right? - I'm not talking to you! - We're okay. - Give me a ride to the hospital. - Your car's out front, Terry. Drive yourself. - I'm going to kill you! Who are you? - One thing I'm not, I'm not your chauffeur. - I'm derlyze' husband, and you're trespassing! - Get out of here, leave! - I'm going to kill you! - You all right? - Yeah, I told you he was mean. - I gave him Herman's doctor's bills, he went berserk. - I'll say, you gonna call the cops? - No, he won't be back. - You could have fooled me. That's not quite the impression I got. - He knows he's not welcome here. It's been over a year since we've seen him. I'm not worried about it, he won't be back. As for you... Last time I saw you, you were fighting off bullies with a broom, and time a paddle. What's next? - I don't know, I'd rather be fighting your weeds with a hoe. - I told her about the bullies. - Yeah, it's okay. I guess you earned yourself another week next door. - Super, I guess that helps. Just so you know, I am trying to mind my own business around here. - That's kind of tough to do around here. - I'll say. ♪ Where a world of lost sinners was slain... ♪ So I'll Cherish the old rugged cross... ♪ Until my trophies at last I lay down... ♪ I will bring to the old rugged cross... ♪ And exchange it someday for a crown... - Thank you all for coming to church today.

Thanks for coming in. - Sorry I was so late. - Better late than never. Hi, I'm pastor Ian lamb. - Mr. What. - What? - It's a long story. - I hope to hear more about it. Good morning, good to see you. Sir, wait up. - You always chase down visitors when they exit the building. - Mostly. We don't get many visitors anymore, so each one's a pretty valuable commodity. - Trying to beef up the church membership? - Well, trying to save the church, period. As you saw in there, we're down to just about 50 or 60 folks. - Not able to pay the bills? - Not really, it's tough. - Well, I'm sorry to say that I didn't drop a dime in the church offering plate. - I guess I might as well let you go, then, right? - I would if I were you. - Forget about the money. It's your soul I care about. - You and who else? - Well, me and the lord. How's that for starters? - I'll take it. Two in my corner is better than none. - Well, good. I've got to run back in there, but feel free to come by any time and let me know how I may be of service to you. - Well, thanks, I just might do that. - We'll see you. - Thank you. ♪ A man sat on a sidewalk strumming his guitar... ♪ His face was old and empty just like his Mason jar... ♪ No one stopped to listen, his head was hanging low... ♪ His right hand thumb was missing, so he picked a ♪ little slow... ♪ Cardboard sign proclaimed his name was ♪ Willie Albert cass... ♪ I took a dollar from myself pocket, dropped it ♪ in the glass... ♪ His face lit up like sunrise, like he'd ♪ risen from the dead... ♪ He formed a toothless grin, and shocked me ♪ when he said... ♪ When I look at you, I look at love... ♪ When I look at you, I look at god above... ♪ Because he blessed you with compassion, ♪ mercy and grace... ♪ You're an angel sent from heaven to the ♪ whole human race... ♪ I see the touch of god's finger on ♪ your beautiful face... ♪ When I look at you, I look at love... ♪ When I look at you, I look at love... ♪ When I look at you, I look at good... ♪ When I look at you, I look at lovely... ♪ When I look at you, I see what we're ♪ supposed to be... ♪ When I look at you... ♪ When I look at you, I look at love...

I bet you can do anything you want. You're a winner, you're smart. You got talent. So what exactly do you want to be? - I want to be like you, helping people. - Like me helping people? - Well, you helped me with the bullies. You saved me from my dad. Heck, you even helped me clean my grandparents' yard. I want to be a big helper, too. - Well, you already helped someone, Bo. - I did? - Yes, sir. You made me realize that I could be a meet a total stranger, and he'd be the nicest kid I ever met in my life. - I did that? - I didn't believe it was possible anymore, but you helped restore my faith in mankind. You did it, and I want to thank you. - You're welcome. Can I take your picture? - What for? - I decided to put pictures of all of my friends on my wall, my bedroom wall. - Okay. How many pictures you got on your wall? - This is the first one. It looks great. - That's a pretty big honor to be number one. - I gotta go download this on my computer. - Well, take care, Bo, adios. - See ya. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Number one. - Here you go, basilius, how's that? - Fine, Amy. - Amy? - Hi, no, I'm Miranda. He doesn't remember my name. - Don't feel bad, I'm his son, and he doesn't remember my name. Hi, father. - I'm tired. - I'll be right back. I gotta get another resident out here. Don't go anywhere. - It's good to see you. Great to see you. - I'm hurting. I'm really hurting. - You'll be okay. You look pretty good. It looks like they're treating you really good around here. - I don't know. - You always treated me really good. I remember when I was a kid and we'd pick up a stone and skip stones and play catch with the baseball in the backyard. Took good care of me when I was a kid. We did all kinds of things together. Remember when I was a kid? - You're madiasco. Madiasco is a good boy, isn't he? - Madiasco is a good boy. Madiasco is a good boy. And you're a good dad. You're a good father. - Madiasco, you hear the breeze coming down the draw? - Yeah. - It's beautiful. Do you feel that, madiasco? - Yeah. - It's beautiful. - You're beautiful. - Madiasco, it's just beautiful. - You're beautiful. - Madiasco, you're beautiful, too. - Dad. Dad, I love you. - I love you. - I love you, dad. I love you. You're beautiful. Dad, you're beautiful. - You're beautiful. Thank you for everything, dad. - We remember basilius wuopio, a man who loved nature and the for rest in particular. He cherished the sunshine and the wind. Bird watching and fishing were his passions. He enjoyed gardening with Fernanda, his wife of 62 years, and the love of his life. He deeply loved his brother Wilhelm and his son madiasco. - Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. - Allow me to share a section of scripture that I believe is appropriate for such a man as basilius wuopio. The Bible in psalms tell us this, oh lord, our lord, how majestic is our name in all the earth. You have set your glory above the heavens. From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise. Because of your enemies to silence a foe and the avenger. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him? The son of man that you care for him? You made him a little lower than heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You made him ruler or the works of your hands. You put everything under his feet. All flocks and herds and the beasts of the field, the birds of air and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the sea. Lord, our lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. - It's true that my father loved much. And I know he loved me. In the end, Alzheimer's stole his memory but not his heart. He had a good heart. And he enjoyed a wonderful marriage to my mother. His family members treasured kindness, his gentleness and his generosity. We have returned his soul to heaven, and I can't wait to see him one day again where there will be complete understanding and restoration and the truth. Rest in peace, my father. - Hi, Mr. What. - Hey, Beau. Good timing. - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm just about to indulge myself in a young man's fancy. - So you're going to throw rocks at fish? - No. No. I'm out here to work on the art of stone skipping, skipping stones across the water. - Hmm. I've never been stone skipping. - Well, my father taught me to do this. He gave me the fundamentals when I was just a little younger than you. So you've never done it before? - Nope. - Nobody ever taught you? - No. - All right. How about if I have the privilege to teach you? I'll take you to the school of hard rocks, hard knocks right now. Wanna learn? - Yeah. - All right. Well, first of all, see, I went through the yard when I was cleaning up things and I found 22 stones. This one is a little rough, but you look for smooth, flat stones that will sail across the water. And what my father taught me is you see a beautiful placid pond like this, kind of turn sideways. Put your shoulder toward the water. You want to get low so you can throw a side arm shot parallel to the water. What the scientists have discovered is that 20 degrees is the perfect angle. I also read the world record holder, he goes all this motion and he's got a baseball wind up and a side arm sling, but that makes it tougher. Let's go simple. Here's my stone. Nice and smooth. Get down low, squat parallel to the water. Side arm. We're going to snap the wrist and give it a toss. Ready? I'm doing this in honor of my father. - For your father. - That's right. Here we go. For him. Ready? - Ready! - Good job! - Thank you. That was cool. - Can I try? - Sure. Pick out a stone. Make sure it's a good one. Is that the one you want? - Yeah. - Sure? - Sure. Positive? - Positive. - It's a good one? - Yeah. Yeah. - All right. What I want you to do is I also know that you should kind a little Nick and a little bump. The world record holder likes it like that. That not perfectly smooth because life isn't perfect. There's bumps and nicks along the way. If you grab hold of those bumps and nicks, sometimes it helps you learn. It helps you grow. It makes you wiser and stuff. That's what life does. So take a stone by that little Nick. Curl your index finger right in that little Nick and then do it, okay? Step over there. - Okay. - Get low. Squat down. Parallel to the water and you're going to throw that side arm throw. Snap your wrist really hard. Okay. Get a horizontal spin. Ready? - Ready. For your father. - For my father. Beautiful. Great try. - Yeah. - Let's do one together. - Okay. - Take that one. I'll grab this one. Get right here. I'll get right here. What we're going to do is throw simultaneously the best we can. For my father. - For your father. - For basilius wuopio! - For basilius wuopio! - Fire! - I thought only kids did this. - You're never too old to live, Beau. There's no age limit to having fun. Take advantage of every single moment you can. - What do you want? - Pay back! - Ahh! Oh! Ah! - Enough! - Aah! Ah! My arm! Don't kill me! - Aah! Do what you were told. Leave and don't come back! Next time I won't call off the dog. - Looks like nobody's home. - Well, my niece gave me a key and permission to go in so let's do it. Police. Anybody home? - Hello? - Hmm. Time to get out of dodge. Too much drama for an ex con to deal with. Been summoned to court anyway so gotta go. Wish you all the best, especially Heather and Beau. Will be in touch. I promise. - Mr. What. - There's no one back there. Shouldn't we go after him? There was definitely a scuffle in the backyard with the axe that you found in the tree. And the neighbors heard yelling. - No. Gary Fisher showed up last night at the hospital. Lacerations from a dog bite. He's accusing Mr. What of it being his dog that attacked him and him chasing him with an axe. - That's all the more reason to track him down, isn't it? Especially the dog. Sounds like he needs to be put down. - Trouble is Mr. What didn't even have a dog. Terry Fisher is a liar and a wife beater so whatever he got last night, as far as I'm concerned he deserves it. If Mr. What had anything to do with it, I owe him one. I think we're done here. No dog. Nobody here. No axe. - Wait. What do you mean no axe? - Somebody I think probably threw it in the lake. - Yeah right, Jim. I still think we ought to find that don't, don't you? It's a menace. - Well, maybe. We'll keep an eye out, but as far as I'm concerned with Mr. What he deserves one break in his life, and I'm giving him one right now. Let's go. - All right then. ♪♪ - How do you tell a man who spent almost a third of his life in prison that you're sorry that a mistake was made? I'm ready to render judgment in this case. Therefore in the case of madiasco wuopio versus the state of Michigan I find that Mr. Wuopio was unjustly and improperly incarcerated for 22 years and 6 weeks at the g. Robert cotton correctional facility in Jackson, Michigan. And doing the math that equates to 1150 weeks of imprisonment. It's my determination that restitution in the amount of $2,000 dollars per week is a fair settlement which totals 2.3 million dollars to be directly remitted to Mr. Wuopio. That's all. - You did it, madiasco. - I can't believe it. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - It's all over now. - Thank god. Thank god. - Fritzy, got a package for you. - Oh. Thanks. - Here's today's mail, pastor. - Oh, thanks, Tammy. Wish there was a million bucks in one of these envelops. - Me, too. You know, there's not enough money this month to pay the church's gas and electric bill. - Oh, man. - I know. ♪♪ - Tammy! Tammy! Guess what? - Oh, what's this? Oh my! Oh my goodness! - Wanna snow ball fight? - Ah! - Okay. I give up. My hands are freezing. Stop! You guys win. You two win. I give up. - I'm a winner. - Yes, you are, Herman. You both are winners. - What? Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! I can't believe it! - What is it, mom? - This is unbelievable. - Hey, Jim. - Hey. - Hey, I got a package addressed to you from Mr. What. - What's the return address? - Looks like nowhereville, usa. - Sweater. This sweater will keep you warm when it's cold during the Michigan winter nights. Study up on those cars because I'll have a job for you in three and a half years when you get out. Count on it. M.W.. - What is it, pastor? - It's not a million dollars but it's 200,000! - 200,000? - Cashier's check. And it came from an offering plate. - Well, whose it from?! - It says on the memo line "here's my dime for your offering plate. Better late than never. Mr. What." - Mr. What? - He's a fella I helped with his father's funeral last summer. Thank god! The church is saved! - I just can't believe it! I just can't believe it! - It's just unexpected. God is good. - You're hands are shaking! Oh, my god. - Father god, thank you. Thank you for Mr. What. Amen. - A quarter of a million dollars! Thanks for taking care of my dad, madiasco. Madiasco. I can't believe it. Oh. - This is unbelievable. It's a check and it's from madiasco wuopio. You know, Mr. What? - Yeah. How much is it? - It's for $150,000 dollars. He says it's for your operation, and the rest of it is for college for you and for Heather. - I love Mr. What! - Me, too! - Oh, I love him, too! This is so great! Yes! Everything is going to be okay. Woo! I'm gonna get you. Oh. Oh wait, Herman. There's one other thing in here. For you. - Mr. What, grand national winner 1958. The original Mr. What. - Wow. - Look at him. - That's cool. Here. Help me up. Come on. - You hear that, frosty. It's a miracle. - What a gift. What a gift. - This horse was a winner, and so are you. Thanks for being my friend, Mr. What. I'll never forget you. - I'll never forget you. - Not guilty. Guess that says it all. - Where you headed? - I'm not sure. South or west, I guess. - I'm going a good ways that way. - This truck got a name? - I call her old faithful. - Got a deal for you. There's $200 bucks. Can you drive old faithful 50 miles farther than you intended? - Huh, does a blue bird sing? Go ahead and put your stuff in the back. - Okay. - I take it that's your dog? - He seems to think so. He saved my life, and now I'm saving him. - I'm Walter honeycutt. - Madiasco wuopio. - What? - That's right. Mr. What.
