I've an idea, Artur. Let's spend the night at the first hotel we find. Goodnight, sleep well. - Please call us at 7. - Yes, sir. Thank you. - What's the matter, Artur? - Nothing... The windows blown by the wind. Can you get the bath ready? Yes, dear. Artur? Are you all right? I'm in no mood for jokes, Artur. Good morning, commissioner. - Is the pathologist in? - He's just done the autopsy. What do you think doctor? The same symptoms as the other two victims. We can rule out revenge and robbery as the motive. It's clearly a maniac at work. Not in the usual sense of the word. This type of behavior lies outside ordinary rules. What exactly do you mean by that? What I mean is that I believe him not to be a man like you or me. So you mean... an animal, a beast. Not quite. - I don't understand, doctor. - Of course not. Come over to my house for a coffee There's a few things I'd like to talk over with you. Certainly. 3 o'clock? 3 o'clock. All right. See you later. Open it at the bookmark, please. "A vampire's greatest power" "comes from the fact that no one believes in its existence." Surely you didn't bring me here to tell me the killer is a vampire. Commissioner... What do you know about vampires? Not much. Just what the legends say. They sleep in a coffin during the day and come back to life at night. They feed on human blood. And you kill them by driving a stake through their hearts. I believe they flee before a crucifix. And they cannot bear sunlight, because it destroys them. That's right. Those are a few of their characteristics. Obviously you don't believe in such creatures. Have you ever thought that we know so little about the beyond? It's my view that truth is always subjective. I find it arrogance to believe one possesses the truth. What are you getting at, doctor? I honestly don't know. But something has worried me for years. Commissioner... do you see me as a sane person? So far... yes. And yet you find it strange that I should believe in the undead, as they are known in legend. Indeed. Yes. Such things are hard to believe for us today. What if I could prove to you that the killer isn't human? If so, I'd yield to the evidence. But I very much doubt you could do it. Here are some diaries and notes kept by my father, Dr. Fischer. My ancestors were born here. We've lived here for over 200 years. We always had a doctor in the family. Not long ago, while going through these notes, I found something that caught my attention. At regular intervals, from 1886 onwards, there have been murder sprees in this town, all similar to the present one. And most strikingly, the murderer was never caught. I wanted to verify certain data with police files. But as you might know, they were destroyed during the war. Don't you think this could be a simple coincidence? There's always murders that remained unsolved. Certainly. But something in these murders goes beyond mere coincidence. Their characteristics are identical. And moreover, they have taken place exactly every 28 years, over the course of 28 days with a 7-day interval between each murder. 7 is a divisor of 28. This makes the number 7 the recurring factor of the killings. I'll concede that this mathematical coincidence, if it is indeed as you say, may lead to some conclusion. But not, I think, of a... supernatural kind. Please take paper and a pencil and work out the figures. Start with this year. Subtract 28 until you come to 1886. Have you got to 1886? Yes. That was the year Baron von Frauler died. Those who knew him thought he wasn't a normal person. He spent the last years of his life secluded in his castle. Nobody ever saw him again. A few months after his death, in that very same year, there was a series of strange murders identical to the ones we've had this year. 28 years later, in 1914, the same thing happened. Those murders were barely noticed in the chaos of war. Except, that is, by my father. And in 1942, once again during a war, World War II, there was more of the same. This time the murders were blamed on Frantz Brauner, a Polish Jew. But my father never believed he was guilty. And now, 28 years later, and with a 7-day interval, as in the previous cases, it's happened again. You should go through these notes. I'll do it for your sake. But do forget all that nonsense. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but unfortunately, when there's a murder, there's also a murderer and a flesh-and-blood one at that. Maybe so. But I believe the timing and characteristics of these murders should be taken into account. You should pay a visit to the Frauler mansion. We might find a clue or some evidence there. You do sound convinced of your theory. Not fully. But I'm certainly most curious to find an answer to my doubts. All right. I'll try to get a search warrant from the judge. If I do, we'll visit that old mansion. Does anyone live there? I don't think so. But the caretaker lives in a small house near there. He's a descendant of Baron von Frauler's butler, who died in 1886. A strange character. Yes, I know who you mean. We questioned him last night. We found no evidence that he was guilty so we released him. And yes, he's certainly a strange man. Well, doctor, I must be going. If I get a permit from the judge, I'll tell you. Goodnight. Thank you so much, commissioner. Goodnight. What do you want? We've a warrant to search the castle, you must let us in. Why don't you go tomorrow during daytime? There's no electric light in the castle. No problem. Can you come with us? One moment. Here you are. Go by yourself I can't go. I'm not well. - He didn't seem pleased to see us. - He sure didn't. Let's go. Check the oil in that lamp. Come on, hurry up. Yes, sir. We're in luck, commissioner. It's full. Baron von Frauler. Well, doctor. There goes your ghost. From what I know, Baron von Frauler and his wife were buried in the castle cellar. I think we should have a look at their tombs. All right, but... What do you expect to find apart from old bones? - Find the door to the cellar. - All right. Let's start there. That must be it. What did you expect, doctor? Let's open the other coffin. What do you think now? This proves nothing. Someone may have removed the corpse. Obviously. But who? And why? There'll be an explanation. We should let the dead rest in peace. Let's go. Go and see who it is. He's dead. Strangled. I don't understand this. But someone who insists on killing right in front of us is sure to get caught sooner or later. I am now convinced that he's a sadistic madman. No-one must disturb the peace of the dead. You knew that. You'll pay for this with your life. "I am the resurrection, and the life" "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." "We commend to Almighty God our brother" "and we commit his body to the ground." "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust." Believe me, mayor. I'm sorry for not being at my predecessor's funeral. Today I'll see his widow and give my condolences. You've lots of hard work ahead of you, commissioner. Everybody in town is deeply concerned. I hope to solve the case very soon. I don't want to hazard a guess, but I think we're dealing with a maniac pure and simple, at least on the evidence of his behaviour. I understand you're one of our wisest policemen. Not really. I just do my job and I've often been lucky. I hope you're lucky this time too. Do please keep me informed. Welcome to Brenitz. Good day, commissioner. Good day to you, mayor. I remain at your service. Let's drive around town, Sieghart. I want to become familiar with this place. How long have you worked here? 8 years, commissioner. - You must know a lot of people here. - Practically everyone. - Tell me about them. - Regarding what? Whatever you can think of. I'll come up with the right questions. We announce the arrival of flight 707 from London. - Is your luggage marked? - Yes. Perfect. Over here please. Come with me. Good morning. - I want to rent a car. - What make? - A Mercedes convertible. - Very well. Good morning. The commissioner, please. He's on the second floor, last door on the right. I arrived from London today. Then I found the castle was sealed, which is why I'm bothering you. No bother at all, Mr. Vishnevsky. I'm at your disposal. You're very kind. I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by your visit. From the reports I had read, which now appear to be incomplete, I thought Baron von Frauler, your predecessor, had died without issue. You mean my father? No. I mean the Baron von Frauler who died in 1886. That was my great-grandfather. He met my future great-grandmother in London. She bore him his only child, my grandfather. He had no children by the baroness. Your father was then a natural child. That's right. But that made no difference to him. On his death in 1886, my grandfather inherited the baron's estate in Germany, this castle. I inherited it from my father. I understand that neither your grandfather nor your father came to live in this estate. Any reason for this? Yes. My great-grandfather imposed certain conditions in his will and these had to be honoured by all successive heirs. Not that I want to pry into your business, but could you tell me about these conditions? No problem. My grandfather, along with his successive heirs, could only live alone in the castle and was not to allow any strangers into the estate, except for his fiancee or wife and the caretaker. Most especially, no visits are allowed to the cellar, where he and the baroness are buried. All this is notarised in the will. My grandfather chose to ignore the inheritance as did my grandfather. May I ask why you've come to Brenitz? I intend to take up residence in the castle for a while. I've always been curious about why my grandfather wanted to impose such absurd conditions on his heirs. I read about the three murders in the press. This gave me the impulse to finally come here. Do you know the local legend about this castle? Yes. I heard my father and grandfather talk about it. But I don't think any sensible person could take such old stories too seriously. Of course. I recently learned that, during World War I, a man died in strange circumstances in that castle. Unfortunately, as the polices files got destroyed during World War ll, I haven't been able to ascertain these circumstances, which are still much talked about by some of the older people in this town. The victim was a second cousin to my father. He lived in the castle with my father's permission. He even furnished it. A few days later, he was found dead in his garden. My father told me about it. This was what made my father definitively forget all about the estate. Now I've come here to prove that these stories are nothing but nonsense. I'll finally put an end to that legend and rescue my great-grandfather's good name. You're entitled to do so. I'll have to keep the will to go to court and request the removal of the seal. Just give me 24 hours. Meanwhile, you can stay at the hotel. It's old but comfortable. Incidentally, do you know where I could find the caretaker? - The castle caretaker? - Yes. He's dead. He died? When? The day after the murders. Some officers went to his house and he was found dead on his bed. The autopsy said it was natural causes. I'm sorry to hear that. - Did he have any children? - No. As per the will, only he or his firstborn could enter the castle. I'll have to get by on my own then. - Good day, commissioner. - Goodbye. Excuse me, baron. If you don't mind me asking, what did you do in London? I don't have a job to speak of. I live off private income. My main hobby is taxidermy. I spend most of my time stuffing animals. Thank you. I was just curious. Good day. Franz? Franz. - Good morning, commissioner. - Good morning. I went to the hotel and got your message, saying you had moved to the castle. I've come to give you back the will you lent me. Thanks, but I intended to call on you today. I wanted to talk to you about last night's murder and also thank you for your help. We must solve this case one way or another, Mr. Vishnevsky. That's for sure. Seven murders in so little time are a cause for alarm. Where were you between midnight and half past 12? Let me think, I believe I was having a stroll. I'd a slight headache so decided to go for a walk. - Do you suspect me perhaps? - No. I was just asking. We policemen have that unfortunate habit. Now, commissioner, what do you really think about all this? To be honest, I haven't even got a rough idea. All seven murders have the same motive. But the murderer never leaves any clues. It's rather strange, out of the ordinary. I've only been in this town for ten days. I initially thought that the murderer, being a sadistic madman, would be easy to identify. But it seems not We've examined and monitored all possible suspects, but to no result. Something in this case lies beyond our reach. - Was I under surveillance last night? - You too. And we saw you re-entered the hotel at 6 minutes past twelve and didn't go out again. Unless, of course, you have the power of invisibility. If so, I could have committed the murders. - What time did it happen? - Between 12 and 12.30. I apologise for not being your invisible man. I asked the judge for a warrant to search the castle. And what did he say? It's still under study. Is it a problem for you? If the judge allows it, I'll have to give in. The will won't let me bring anyone there, except for the woman I plan to marry. However, if compelled by law... Do you think the key to it all might be in the cellars? Why not? It will be interesting if you get the warrant. I'd have an excuse to go into the cellars too. You're saying you haven't been there yet? You know the will won't let me. But who'd know if you'd been there or not? I don't know. There might be a seal or something that would be broken. I'm liking this estate and don't want to lose it. I prefer to play by the rules of the game. Those are provisions for a few days. The house is still uninhabitable. I presume you'll stretch the terms and bring in your fiancee. It must be tedious living here alone. Yes, but I'm afraid she won't come although I've asked her to. Just leave it all there. - See you soon, Mr. Vishnevsky. - I'm at your disposal any time. Good morning, Baron. We have your order here. Come on. 6th Diary of Franz Vishnevsky, Baron von Frauler. Frauler Mansion 16 December 1870. Today I return from Berlin after traveling for 30 days. Dr. Grant has failed to find a remedy for the illness that is afflicting me since my last visit to Vienna. That's such a fantastic tale, I can't possibly believe it. So who opened the door? Who lit the candles in the cellar? You said you'd drunk half a bottle of whisky. Yes, but I was sober. Everyone who's had one too many says the same. It was hallucinations, due to the atmosphere and circumstances. Try to control your nerves or I'm very much afraid you'll go mad! I was completely sober! The evidence says otherwise. Any news on the search warrant? I'll see the judge today. Once we get the warrant we'll do a full search. There may be some truth in what you say. But even so, you should forget about ghosts and stuff. I've no doubt that someone's trying to drive us all mad. But whoever it is, it's someone of flesh-and-blood who sooner or later will be arrested. I'm convinced that those 7 murders are related to what happened to me last night. Maybe, you never know. But my experience has taught me not to jump to conclusions. As a policeman I suspect everything, look into everything and then draw a conclusion. The truth eventually emerges. It's best not to act too rashly, Mr. Vishnevsky. Come on, Mr. Vishnevsky! I understand what you're going through. But you must be strong or leave there. If not, your mental health... might be at risk. Try not to drink too much, it's dangerous. I've known lots of people who went round the bend after becoming obsessed with just one crazy idea. Yes, commissioner? Any word from customs? All in order. Vishnevsky entered Germany the day he said. We checked the rest of it and it matches his statements. Vishnevsky told me some strange things today. They sound absolutely preposterous to me. He's either going crazy or clumsily trying to put us on the wrong track. Either way, keep him under close and constant surveillance. What do you think of him? Well, if he is the murderer, we'll catch him. However... I'm inclined to think he's out of his mind. Or exceptionally brave. A beer What's the time? Half twelve. You can go. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. - Don't let anyone see you leave. - Sure. - Good morning, Mr. Vishnevsky. - Good morning. - The search warrant. - Come in. Please. Are you ill? No, just had too much to drink last night. Yes, so I see. Did you know there were two more murders last night? No, I haven't left the house since yesterday. I know. Want a coffee? No, thanks. I want to start as soon as possible. I've given orders to comb the whole region inch by inch. 200 officers will be coming today to help us. What's happening here is unprecedented. We've got to solve it. Where do you want to begin? In the cellar. Right, come with me. The warrant allows us to open the coffins. Just what I thought. Those venerable old bones can't possibly be the murderer. I'm still unsure. When I was here the other day, the coffin was open and the candles were lit. If so, they would have disappeared. The wax would have melted away. Forget about the other night. It was obviously just an hallucination caused by too much imagination and too much drinking. There's something strange going on here. Trying to find a natural explanation is not only wrong but unhelpful. Don't you find it strange that, despite all your surveillance, the murderer is still on the loose? We'll catch him, you can be sure of that. How can you be so sure? I don't know. But murderers get caught sooner or later. Come on, admit it, you're as baffled as the rest of us. Something here is beyond our understanding. I don't deny it. But we must continue with our inquest. Or do we ignore the case, since its origins are supernatural, so nothing can be done about it'? Now we'll have that cup of coffee you offered us. - Anything to declare? - No. - That's my luggage. - OK, go ahead. So you decided to come after all. There's a lot of talk in the press about what's happening here. I came here out of female curiosity. Besides, I wanted to see you. Like it? I find it horrible. I'm sure it's haunted. Marianne, I think you should go back to London. Why? I don't understand. You asked me to come. I know, but strange things have been happening. You'll protect me. The castle looks secure. This is no laughing matter, Marianne. You act strange. What are you worried about? Show me round the castle. I'm dying to see it. Check. What's on your mind? Do you believe in the supernatural? Hey, your king is in check. No, I don't. Why not? It's just old legends. Why do you ask? No reason, forget it. Checkmate. You know what? This is the first time I've ever beaten you. Tired? A bit. Corning to bed? You go. I'm finishing work on a fox. I'll come later. Don't be too long. You've not seen me for a long time. Good evening, Adolf. No, this is no hallucination. I am the 4th Baron von Frauler, your ancestor. You need not fear me. You carry my blood. There is no harm I can do to you. I've come to welcome you to your home. Our home. A terrible curse lies upon me. You must help me. You must drive a wooden stake through my heart so I may find everlasting peace. If my soul continues to wander, every seven years, an insatiable thirst for blood will push me to the most unspeakable desires. You must do it, Adolf. You must do it. My instinct will be to stop you. But you must fight against me until you succeed. Once you've succeeded, bury me in the cellar, leave this house and bar the door so nobody disturbs my peace. Are you all right, Marianne? What's wrong, Adolf? What is it? Adolf. You're upset, darling. You must calm down. Sorry but I'm not leaving. Now you need me more than ever. You're unwell. You should see a psychiatrist. Everything I've said is true. Believe me, you're in danger. Let's both leave. No, I must stay. I told you before. I must put an end to these horrible murders. - He asked me to do so himself. - I can't believe this. You're imagining it. We'll go to the doctor today. I'm not going to any doctor! I'm perfectly sane! It's for your own good, Adolf. Can't you see? Think about it, please! I know it's hard to believe but unfortunately it's true. - Adolf... - I'm the only one who can solve this. Please do as I say. You're not the only person to suffer from hallucinations. Once you've been treated, you'll be fine. Then we can travel around Europe and have fun. You must take your mind off all this. The legend of this castle has obsessed you. And that's all it is: A legend. You're becoming worked up. The age of ghosts and witches is long over. Think about it. Try to see things as they are. Don't know. Maybe you're right. And the murders? Who committed those murders? Something strange is happening. Murders sometimes go unpunished. But not when there are so many in a row. There's police all over the place and they've not found a clue. For the last time, Marianne. Leave this house. - I'll rejoin you in London. - I can't leave you here like this. I'm sorry, I must stay. I must see the commissioner. He's not in. But his deputy can make an appointment this afternoon. - Thank you. - Not at all. I'm really worried, commissioner. Today he asked me to leave again. He says I'm in danger. He's acting strange, obsessed with this idea. He thinks his ancestor is a vampire and that the vampire is the murderer. I think you should take him to a psychiatrist. I know that nobody entered or left the castle while the murders were committed. He's clearly imagining all this. As for you, if you need any help, just open the window and shout. The castle is surrounded by police. Ever since I realised Mr. Vishnevsky was showing signs of mental disturbance, and that some emergency might turn up, I put him under close surveillance. You know what can happen in such cases. The atmosphere and circumstances might make him think he's the reincarnation of his ancestor and he may commit such deeds as he believes the ancestor would have done. There have been a few such cases. Anyway, you must be very careful and convince him as soon as possible to see a doctor. Goodbye, commissioner. Good day. "Treatise on Vampires" What's that for? I've decided to do as he asked. I'll do it tonight. Please get some sleep. Your nerves need a rest. Please, Marianne, I thought I'd made it clear I am not insane. Let's not talk about it again. Fine, I'll go to bed then. I'll have a bath first. Make sure to lock your door. It was nothing. The hook must have come off and it fell. - You're alright? - Yes. Marianne! Run, Marianne! Go lock yourself in! Run, Marianne, run! Good, Adolf, good. You're a brave man. You're worthy of my lineage. You are trying to fulfill my wishes. You must continue fighting against me. You must bring my bloodlust to a definitive end. Open the door, Marianne. It's me, Adolf. I had a momentary hallucination but it's over now. Adolf, are you alright? Yes, Marianne. I feel well. Please open the door. No Marianne, don't open it! Marianne will be mine tonight, Adolf. It will be your fault. You should have kept her away from the castle. Rest in peace, Baron von Frauler. The nightmare's ended, Marianne. It's all over. - Are you all right? - Yes. We can go back to London. Going away? Yes. - For how many days? - For good. I think you're doing the right thing. A holiday will do you good. I'm afraid there'll be no more murders once I leave. If so, I hope you don't suspect I was the killer You know we policemen suspect everyone. But don't worry. The killer's been caught. That's what I came to tell you. - Caught? - Yes. It was a young lunatic who escaped from an asylum two months ago. He confessed to all the killings. Then, when the policemen holding him lost their guard, he jumped out of a sixth-floor window. - Dead? - Yes. I told you the police always get their man. Congratulations, commissioner. You must feel quite relieved now. Thank you, Mr. Vishnevsky. I wish you a fast recovery. Now, commissioner, Yesterday I went to the public library in Stuttgart. I read a lot about vampires. Did you know that those bitten by a vampire also become vampires? Hell! If so then the whole town must be infested with them. Good luck, Mr. Vishnevsky. Bye, Miss Marianne. Goodbye, commissioner. Goodbye. Have a good journey. You know what, Sieghart? At times I thought Vishnevsky might be right. But as you know well, regulations won't let us believe nonsensical talk. And as the evidence has shown, the regulations are always right. Let's drive around a bit. We deserve a rest. Certainly, commissioner. - Shall I fill it up? - Yes, please. Say, Adolf. I think we should go back to the castle next year. Don't you think? Yes, why not? Thank you, goodbye. Can I tell you something? I believe in vampires. So do I.
