I'll run away from myself, But I can't stop loving you. What am I looking at so severely? Do they see in such a way, while loving, Dear, important person. Prohibiting him to come in! I'll run away from myself, But I can't stop loving you. Aren't you tired of that light music? What? You have to study. I'll not, it's enough. Galya! What? Listen...... I want to tell you one thing. Then tell that thing. It seems I fell a little in love. Don't you feel a little stupid? Are you ready for today's test? I'm ready. Maybe. "Maybe", "it seems." You have to know it exactly. Talk about what? Nothing. One more unexpected confession. Galina! What confession? Shura! Are you sick? Perfectly healthy! What's happened? Very unstable subject. Mom, you spoiled her in everything. Dad'll not allow it if he's alive. Am I to be blamed? I blame nobody. But I have a responsibility as her sister. Isn't it too early? Where are you going? To study with my girlfriend. Take this with you. I'll go with you. Directions are different. I see. - I'm sorry. - Please don't mind. So early you go. - I have a thing to do. - Really? Galina! - Good morning. - Good morning. - May I join you? - Please. It is a wonderful morning! Yeah....Didn't you see my sister? - She passed by. - Where? There... I'm sorry. Galina I need to talk with you on an important thing. Important? Yes, for me. Go on. You know.... I want to tell you one thing. Then tell that thing. It seems to me.... - a little.... - in love? Yeah. With whom? With you. Don't you feel a little stupid? It's stupid, Gleb. We are scientists, with serious challenges. We have no time to do silly things. You are like Shura. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Telescope? Or binoculars? Binoculars, please. - Pyotr Nikitich. - What? Aren't your angry to me for calling? No, not at all. I'm off today. I was in such a hurry. Really? For what are you look around? Someone may follow us. Who? My sister. - I said I'll study with girlfriend. - Why? - Are you scared? - No. She thinks I'm a child, - and follows me everywhere. - Because she loves you. She doesn't love anyone, except herself. By the way did you bring her work? Yes. Here it is. Thank you. And here's my work. P.K.(Pyotr Kolchin) Thank you. They say handkerchief is a gift of farewell. - I don't believe in omens. - So? Give me a telescope. - The telescope's more terrible. - Telescope? Here is the bus stop. - Pyotr Nikitich. - What? Can we say our relationship to be a romance? - The name doesn't matter. - Yes, I understand. The unity of form and content. You're still a child, Shura. - You are like Galya. - What? I'll be late for the test. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Please visit us. I'll introduce you to my sister. Oh, oh.... Ambulance! Everyone! Please don't worry. She'll come to now. She's to be blamed. Let's call the ambulance. Comrade soldier. The collar! Loosen the collar. Miss, you must follow the rule. Don't look around to other gentlemen. Are you hurt? I'm not hurt at all. Look, as I said, she came to. - Can I help you? - I'll do it myself. What are you looking at? You must be more careful. It's pre-scientific. It's a contingency. You know, nothing happens by chance. Everything has its cause. You suffer from myopia, aren't you? And you, from garrulity. Give me 10 kopeika. By the way, It's your glasses. Hello? Whom you need? Now we'll extract the heart. Comrade Zavartsev! A call for you. Wait a minute. Don't touch anything when I'm out. Hello? - Gleb? - Yes. Can you come to Lenin Hill? It seems you're happy to torment me. Why? Don't touch the heart! The useless! Galina. Galina! Shall I accompany you? I can go alone. Apparently you love bicycle sports? Not too much. You're strange. Who are you? Do you always get acquaintance on street that way? I have no system. But you have a rich experience. Are you a ballerina? Or an actress? A manicurist. Comrade Murashova. You don't know anything. I know, professor. Then you are very good at hiding your knowledge. Please ask me more questions. All right. Then, please tell me.... about the bourgeois novels of early 19th century. - About novels? - Yes. I......I forgot the beginning. I forgot the beginning. Then, please start from the end. Please give me another chance for the autumn. What's happened to my severe heart? To my disturbed mind? On the lane, - and on the road - It's nice to go with you. I'll run away- from myself. What'a happened? I don't know. Maybe you got tired of studying? Maybe you want to marry? Maybe you want to become a housewife? I can't understand! How you've never met such things! It's just an accident. Nothing happens by chance. Everything has its cause. Listen. Let's go to camp with me! Where will Shura stay there? She can stay in some villa. She must leve as far as possible away from "accidents". Who will provide us the villa? I'll ask them. I'll go now to the university. I don't want to force my will on you. Shura? I agree. I can't hear you. I agree! Now I can hear. - You need a bouquet? - Yes, please. With importance or not? What do yo mean? For a lady or for a girl? For a girl. Wait a minute. - Please. - Thank you. Give me flowers, uncle. What are you doing? Go! You? I'm sorry, but.... Did you follow me? How did you dare? - Sorry...... - I gave you no motive. I assure you...... that I have no...... How shameless! Thank you, uncle. Do you need me? "On Georgian hills Descended the night fog." "Before me Agrava is rippling" - 120. "I feel sad and easy" - 333. "My sadness is bright." I'm busy! "My sadness is......" Professor Erushov May I come in? Miss Galina! You're always welcome. Why you don't wear glasses? Because my sight got better. I have to talk about the committee. Oh, please sit down. I'll hear you. I want to participate in the camp. How do you manage with the dissertation? You can do both. Of course, with your capacity.... All right. - Arkagy Vasilievich, I.... - What? May I invite there my sister and mother? - My sister needs fresh air. - Something wrong with the heart? - Yes, in general.... - In general? It's nothing! I recommend the wild rose, vitamin C. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Galina? - Please come in. We have a misfortune here. Galina? - She's fallen. - Where? Shura is in trouble. Go to her. She may talk with you. You're a student. Surely it's unpleasant, but not a tragedy. You'll pass it in autumn. - Don't mind. I'll help you. - The problem is.... that literature is my favorite subject. - I know everything. - So? Nobody knows anything. What? Know nothing? You feel ashamed before your sister. She's to be blamed in everything. She's hot-tempered, cold and spite. Wears glasses without lenses. - Really? - Yeah. I see. - Antonina Vasilievna. - What? I'd like to ask you to put the bicycle aside. - My customers are complaining. - I'll do it right now. - What's happened to her? - Shura? - She got sick? - Healthly. She is fine. Where is the bicycle? - Who is she? - Tamara Sporidonovna. A manicurist. Enough! You should feel ashamed, and regain the reason. You must not lose yourself. You must be active. Now, I'm a biologist. But I'll fix this in front of you. Try it. Excuse me. Shura, a call for you. A pleasant male voice. Shura? Hello. Hello. Did you come today? Yes, but I didn't enter your house.... - It happened that.... - What's happened? More loudly! There happend an event. I see. But it's good.... that you didn't come. Will you talk for long? Miss Tamara, a little more. - I need the phone very much. - I see. Thank you. Pyotr Nikitich, there's one waiting. Quickly. With whom you're talking? - With a neighbor. - Talk loudly! It's a trouble. Hello? - A neighbor. - Who is she? What's her profession? She's a manicurist. Ma-ni-cu-ri-st. I can't talk more loudly, do you see? Yes, I see. I see everythingl. Pyotr Nikitich. I said you, I need the phone. Only a half second. You shouldn't, here is co-housing. Pyotr nikitich, one needs phone by all means. Who? The manicurist? Why don't you leave her alone. Pyotr Nikitich. You know, we're leaving. What's that? Where? We're leaving together to the villa. Sister will give lectures at the camp. We'll syay in the village during the summer. Pyoe Nikitich? It means a long goodbye for us. You should try to stay near our camp. - Which camp? - Yuriev military camp. Then we'll meet. It's impossible. Dear Shura! What? Comrade, it's time! Wait a little. - Shura! - Hello! Place the handset. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Antonina Vasilievna! - What? - Are you leaving? - Yes. - Wher? - To the villa, where they live. - Galina leaves? - Yes. - A group of the university? - I don't know details. Oh! I don't believe that you dno't know. No, I don't know. Wait! - Bike? - I will fix it later. - ...with her own guidance. - Excuse me, professor. - Doesn't it bother you? - That's nothing. Please tell me, is lecturer Murashova in your group? In general she in in the list. In fact, it's better for us to have a math lecture. Do you know her? - Not acquainted with her. - ....then with whom? ....with her thesis. I know all her works. I'm a astrophysicist, but personally know her. I'm not against that. Especially as I do this for you there's no reason to refuse. Arkady Vasilievich, I'll go. How is the condition of your heart, comrade? It's good. Vitamin C! I've always said that it makes a miracle. How did we decide about Murashova? Oh, yes. She needs a villa for her family. We have no villa in our camp. - But we'll find it nearby. - I think it easy. Then write down Murashova. - May I call her? - Please. - Phone number is.... - I know it. - Oh, yes, You know her work. - Yes. Comrade Murashova? Hello. You don't know me. He's pretending. I'm a representative of the sponsored troops. They know very well each other. Do you think so? I have a long life experience. Your camp participation is approved. I'll take care of your family. In the camp of your troops? Yes, in our Yuriev camp. I'm very grateful to you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hey, all went well. I talked with a soldier now. Very kind comrade, who promised to give us aid. You'd better go now. You had nothing to do here. I'll go after with prof.Ershov. To which camp are we going? - It's named Yuriev camp. - Galina! What's happened? I has started. A soldier, comrade.... - That's Yuriev camp! - Oh, I'm sorry. I've forgetten to get your consent. No, I'm fine.... I'm sorry. Shura, an another call for you. The same pleasant male voice. Mom, say that I'm absent. Sit down, mom. I'll say so. - Who are you? - It's her acquaintance. Oh, acquaintance! Comrade acquaintance, she can't come to phone. She'll be absent in Moscow on a long trip. - So please don't call anymore. - I am glad. Are you glad? Then it's better. Beryoski (birch) How is it with our benefactors? All right? Are you ready not to be ashamed? - I think it's okay. - So? How is it with Murashova's family? It's all right. Then it's good. - They said there're women. - Yes. So what? - Meet them with a bouquet. - Then, do it. I feel somehow uncomfortable. Why uncomfortable? It's better you give it to them. Do it yourself. We can't throw it away.... - Give it to them. - Okay, like a friend. - Hello, comrade Zavartsev. - Hello. Hello. Hello, professor. Where's comrade Murashova? On the next coach. Again! Yes, again. What a man! Thank you. - Hello. - Let me introduce you a young lecturer Murashova. Hello. Comrade Colonel, thank you for the care for my family. I have a favor to ask. Can't you give some math lessons in addition to a lecture to our future academicians. Gladly. I came here for that. - I leave up to you their organization. - Yes, comrade colonel. Let's go. Where? - What's happened? - The starter is.... I'll help. Here, professor. This car is interesting. Yes, it' a new model. It's for test-runs. For test-runs? Then I'd like to sit on the tested car. - Can I? - Yes, please. It's interesting.... Now it's all right. I'll go on the other car. We'll go on this car. Let me drive the car. Without the orders I don't have such right. What's happened? Comrade colonel, please allow me to drive the car. Can you drive a car? Yes. - Look. - I'm not against it. Thank you. Please move to the first car. I can't leave the car. Everything around became blue and green. The creek began to flow rushing, the water began to sing. The whole life flows by law of the spring. There is no escape from love, nowhere.... Love releases nobody from itself. Above every window nightingales sing. Love is never - without grief.... Hold the handle more firmly! Sit on the car more firmly. It's not a bad song. How do you like it? We come to the ford soon. Turn to the left. I said you to turn to the left. Are you fear to have your feet wet? Excuse me. Come here. What? Are you fear to have your feet wet? Together. Push. - I'll fix it myself. - Okay. What's happened? A littlel accident. Why don't you help her? Comrade Murashova will do all herself. Break and fix it herself. That's charming. What does it mean? - It's really a delicate technique. - Do you think so? I have a fairly long life experience. A serious damage. It takes 30 minutes. Do you think so? I always think, and recommend you to do so. I see. Please sit down. Please. Love is never without grief. And it's more pleasant - than grief without love. It's strange. What's strange? That you happen to be a mathematician. Why "happen to"? Do you think that a woman can only be a manicurist? The matter is not the profession, but the character. You know, character is my personal matter. The first lesson is assigned at 10:00 tomorrow morning. Okay. But I decisively ask you not to seek personal meeting. I've not sought it in the past and will not in future. Thank you. - Galina! - Hello. What's happened? Did you get wet? Did it rain? Rain clouds came above us. Can't you dispense with stupid questions? Did you quarrel? - No, we knew each other. - So what? - Your sister is a difficult character. - Yeah. - In addition, - Goodbye. Oh! Gleb? Did you come with Galina? No. I came with prof. Erushov. Myself. Come in. Shura. Tell me, has Galina known Kolchin for long? Why? Go. They may hear us. - That lieutenant come often? - Yeah. No, only once. - Did he ask? - Ask what? About me? Yes, surely. About you... he asked only about you. Disgrace! Don't get angry to Shura. She's displeased because.... Kolchin has gone. It doesn't concern her at all. You see? I see. - You see? - No, not at all. Kolchin and Galina? I don't believe it. I assure you that she came to the camp for him, dragging you. Impossible. I'll show the evidence. Comrade Eremeev, come here. You somehow began to be left behind in all classes. It's before the competition of the regiment. What's happened to you? Are you sick? No, comrade senior lieutenant. - Come to me after the class. - Yes, sir. - May I go? - Stand with the column. Hello, comrade gentlemen! Attention! Eyes right! Comrade Colonel, we are at the morning roll call. - Continue. - Yes. To the right! Forward march! Comrade Kolchin. Agreed with Murashova on lessons? Our lesson is assigned today. - It may not work. - Why? Your team has a special mission. Maybe we can't gather participants. - Do you allow me. - Yes, I do. Comrade! As you know, gentlemen. Moon is Earth's satellite. This is a dead celestial body. It is shining by reflected light, so to speak, "shining but not warming". The time of Moon's rotation is.... equal to the time of its turning around Earth. So only one side of Moon is visible. So we understand it very "one-sidedly". This is a mediocre lizard. It's the closest relative of famous chameleons. Chameleons! Look for it. There it is! - Shura. - What? Do you have a minute? - Haven't you seen your sister? - No. Why? There will be our lesson. - No! - Shura. I have to talk with you. We also have a lesson. - Look! - Yeah. Where do giant salamanders live? I already said. Only in the North America. Do toads live everywhere? Yeah, they live everywhere. Where is the Group? You know, it happened that the group is me. That's not clever. And you promised not to meet personally. - I came to the lesson. - Did you? I can explain it if wish. Less words and more action. Shall we start, if you came to the lesson? Please solve the problem. Oh, I'm sorry, please. Please don't mind. There is no atmosphere, no water on Moon. Thus there's no life, either. But it plays a role directly in our life. By its attraction it effects on the ebb of the sea. There are two values. Geometric mean of 2 numbers and the arithmetic average. Which of them is larger? You must choose only one of them. May I start? Please. Mayve you need help? No. I'll try it myself. I have to find the difference between the values. - Right? - Right. If the difference is a positive - A is larger than B. If negative, then smaller, right? Right. I've never thought you're really interested in math. Why it doesn't suit for the the commander? I mean not the profession, but the character. Then we'll not talk about the character. Right? No, it's wrong. Is the lesson going well? A little accident. What? Comrade Kolchin's choosing the larger value from the two. Why don't you help him? He'll do alone. He makes a mistake and corrects it himself. That's charming. If it is positive, then "d" is negative, right? Right. Therefore - M+N÷2 is larger than the square root of MN. Choice was done. Now you see your mistake? Yes I see. Well, well... Now do you see the hypocrisy of Galina? I see. But I'll not forgive it. - I'll exposed her. - It's correct. I have a plan. "The curve of mistakes and the notion of contingency" by G. Murashova. ♪ Curve of mistakes, I'm sorry. Never mind. I have to talk with you on a delicate problem. Please. I know everything. You got acquaintanted with Murashova before the camp. With which Murashova? Who know well who matters. You have close relationship with only one Murashova. Why does it interest you? - But serious and. - Why? - You're a soldier, right? - So? - I'm a scientist. - So what? What? We cherish the truth above all. Are you serious toward her? What do you mean? Well, to say.... Are you going to marry her, for example? You're too hasty, comrade Zavartsev. Marry! It's not pouring the water into a glass. It's a very responsible act. I've been dealing with her as a child. - As a child? - Of course, a very honest child. You don't know people. She is an egoist. You are exaggerating too much. Please don't get angry to me. No. Comrade Zavartsev. You kow, wife and - - love and family.... - Family.... They are all serious things. - But... - What? It seems to me that you deal with those - serious things not seriously, with her. No way! It's unpleasant. - Then you need to end it. - What do you mean? Immediately explain it to her. I want to, but she is avoiding me. That's a game. Don't believe it. Go there? Wait a minute. Dear Shura. I can't go to your home Your sister is the obstacle. I'll explain all when we meet I will wait you at 20:00 - on the cape. P. Kolchin. Please hand this letter to her. Okay. Goodbye. Where? It's easiler over there. That's right. I'm sorry. Everything around became blue and green. The creek began to flow rushing, the water began to sing. The whole life flows by law of the spring. There is no escape from love, nowhere. Nowhere...... Love releases nobody from itself. Above every window nightingales sing. Love is never without grief. But it's more pleasant - than grief without love. Listen. Aren't you tired of that light music? No, why? You're disturbing me. Forgive me, please. Shura? I want to tell you one thing. So? Tell that thing. It seems I've a little misunderstood Kolchin. Don't you feel yourself a little fallen in love with him? What a stupid thing! I'was talking on his personality. - I see. - Yeah. He has will, education and intelligence. No. It can be said only on Zavartsev. Zavartsev? He is surprisingly frivolous and empty. - You can't judge of him. - Neither you of Kolchin. Oh... P.K. (Pyotr Kolchin) How did you get this? It seems, maybe he gave it to me for bandage. "Maybe", "it seems." You have to know it exactly. Hello. Hello. - Are you studying? - Yes. How is your health? Your heart? Heart? It's okay. How is the effect of wild rose? Wild rose? - She drinks it. - Very well. I always say that vitamin C makes a miracle. It's especially so when combined with fresh air. Professor, how about goat milk? It is very good! Although I prefer soured milk. - Kolchin confessed all. - Really? Here is the evidence. This is conclusive evidence. What's written there? His letter to Galina. What did he wrote? I don't read letter of others. - It's not good. - Of course, not good. What can we do? Read? Read. He doesn't come here because of me. - What a man! - No, she's to be blamed. But I made his eyes open. Galina Sergeevna. Your sister is a wonderful girl. Yes, but she is still frivolous, always interested in such balony like secret dating or love letters. Slove letter? Yes. Galina, a letter to you. From Kolchin. Is it a bad joke? In any joke there is a piece of truth. I'll go now to tell it to the regiment commander. It's charming. Is the regiment commaner here? It seems he's here. Please wait I'll report it to him. Thank you. Comrade Eremeev. You are like an other man. Though you were among best soldiers. What' happened to you? Did you fall in love? Yes, comrade senior lieutenant. I fell in love. With whom? She is a teacher, in a elementary school. Here she is. She looks like Ropshina. So, are you all right? - No. - What? Her character is such that she teaches me everything. - Teach what? - "This isn't so, that's not so...." But she say nothing about that thing. About what? About our joint route, that is, love. Did you answer the letter? I'm writing. - For a long time? - No, now it's only 9-th day. May I read it, comrade lieutenant? Please, read it. Hello, dear Nyusha. You asked me about my success? I always think of you and can't sleep at night. I began to lag in class. I'm ashamed before the commander of the compaby, comrade Kolchin. Everything is somehow different. - I know that. - You see. Here's a piece of paper, and a pen. Write. Write as follows. Dear Nyusha. How are you. Thank you for the letter. You've written just little about our love. In my opinion love can help us in any case. Period. So I've been one of the best soldiers until now. The company commander comrade Koruchin is satisfied. It's not true, comrade senior lieutenant. It depends on you, isn't it? Make it true. - Yes, I'll make it true. - Write on by yourself, but briefly. - Comrade senior lieutenant. - What? The photo, please. Hello, did you ask me? Hello. Comrade Kolchin. For a minute. It concern you, too. In fact... Thank you. Ih fact the last math class was almost cancelled. Who's responsible? I am. The group was too small for me. Grouup can be larger. The point isn't the number, but the same members of people. It's better for learning more deeply. You see it better. I'd like to assign a lesson tonight. Today there's a rehearsal of orchestra. Oh, I see. Then, maybe we have a classes at my villa. I don't oppose making that exception. It's very good. - May I go? - Yes, please. Go. - Everything is all right? - Thank you. Goodbye. Stendhal "About Love". "Women prefer emotion than reason" reason.... reason. Then? "Reason is never useful to them." It's obnoxious. Don't be offended, Shura. Remember, when studying Standahl, we have to consider the bourgeois moral of the 1-st half of the 19th century. It's pulling! It was too early. Oops! Sorry, Gleb. Don't mind. Now it's okay. Norms of Love in the 19 century... "Those who can't keep a secret, can't love." The second paragraph. "No one can be in love with 2 people at once." Gleb, I've wanted to say for long.... Oops! The hats! Let's go there! Quickly! What did you put theret? No one comes in such a weather. Kolchin is the commander of Red Army, so has eyes to see. Come in, comrade Kolchin. Major Pyryaev, came to the mathe lesson. Please... sit down. Take off the coat, comrad major. Subaltern Naidyonov. May I join you. Please... Please sit down. Comrad tutor. May we take part in the lesson? Please... Mom! Bring here chairs, please. Please come here, comrade lieutenant. I'll stand. It's all right. Did Comrades Kolchin get afraid of thunder? Comrade Kolchin can't attend the lesson today. I think we can open the windows. It's sultry here. The wind seems to have ceased. Thank you. Please sit down. It look like the letter to you, almost discarded. I can't go to your house. The obstacle is your sister.... I'll wait at 21:00 on the cape. Considering special circumstances I must end the lesson at 8 pm. Comrades, let's concentrate. Yes. Let's begin. "I will do my best to become callous." So? "I want to make my heart keep silence." "Maybe she has a lot to say to it." Be careful to health. Thank you, Gleb. Don't you feel cold? No. Gleb, you know.... I've wanted to say you for long that... I and Kolchin are in Moscow - Pyotr Nikitich. Hello. Hello. Have you been waiting me long? I've not been waiting you at all. I've hurried. I was busy. - Be careful. - Thank you. Pyotr Nikitich. I'm listening to you. Be careful to your health. Let's go along the river. Pyotr Nikitich. Now no one will disturb us. We are alone. I'm listening to you. Why they are turingh at the same place? They fell into a whirlpool. Tell me, did you arrange my coming here? Yes. I knew it. Galina Sergeevna. I have to say.... everything. I owe my encounter with you to Shura. Did you invite me only to say that? You kow, I.... didn't invite you. Oh,... what...! I wonder what he's saying. I love you. Then the letter was addressed to Shura? Yes. And the sister who is obstacle, it's me. Yes. But...... It must be seen in other way. In what way I must see the bouquet? Remember? Or was it also for Shura? Unfortunately. Take my hat. Please row toward the shore. More quickly! Fast! Galina Sergeevna! Shura! Kolchin confessed me all. You had a romance with him. Congratulations! Shura. Is that true? Yeah. Then you knew him from before? Yes. Your coming was arranged by him? Yes, but... - It's pulling. - Too late! I've wanted to tell you. I'm winding up the rod. - Gleb! - Never! Gleb! How is she? Who? Your dear Nyusha. She writes letters? She sent me a telegram. - Then it's all right. - Well. Comrade Kolchin. - Do you have a minute? - Yes, please. Of course you go to Murashova's house? - So what? - Please hand this book to Shura, to Alexandra Sergeevna. And you? I'll leave. Where? To Moscow. - Thank you for eveything. - Thank you, too. Goodbye. What' happened to severe heart? To my disturbed mind. On the lane - and on the road - It is nice to go with you. Meetings are rare, and waiting is long. And the gaze is anxious, the talk is inconsistent. I'd like to quit the farewell. But there is no encounter if there were no farewell. Never... Gleb! Where are you going? - To the station. - Why? I've done all my lecture, have nothing to do here. Me, too. Sit down. I will send you. Thank you. Hello, Galina Sergeevna. I'm going to visit your house. They will welcome you. Where do you go? To the station. Then, see you. Be careful. Hello, Shura. Hello. - It's your book. - Thank you. It's from Zavartsev. - Through you? - He's leaving. When? At 21:20. - Why? - I don't know. Did you let him go? How rude! It's inhuman! Take me to the station! I can't. Ah, I see! What's happened, Pyotr Nikitich? - Where is she going? - I don't know. To whom? To Galina Sergeevna. She's not here. She has left to Moscow. Why? I don't know. What's happened? What's the matter? All of them ran in a hurry, I'll become crazy. Sit down. All my young people became mad. - That's nothing. - Why? Antonina vaslievna, A.Pushkin said about it; "Nothing will tormet and warry My sadness." "And the heart will blaze and love again." "Because it can't help but loving." Nothingness. It's not nothingness. I have a fairly long life experience. Nothingness! Returnn, please. Your mother is angry. Where are you going? - To the station. - Then let's go together. - The bicycle. - Have it with you. Hurry up! More firmly. Start! Where's Gleb? To buy tickets. Two tickets to Moscow. One, 1 ticket!
