It's beautiful, Sam! It's poetic. It's about prawn cocktail and cashew brie. Still, no one writes food pairing trends like you. I can romance canapés in my sleep. But what I really need is something big. Like a twelve course, Italian-style dinner, with that little dessert in the middle? What's that called again? Like a story that will capture the hearts of Winslow House Publishing. They are the name in romance novels. A palate cleanser, that's what its called! Delicious. If I can get a Wedding Belle Magazine cover story, I might actually have a shot at getting my first romance novel published. How's that novel coming, anyway? I worked on it all last night. - Again? - Yeah, I can't seem to finish. It's like something's missing, but I can't put my finger on it. I'm just hitting a creative block. Maybe you need to focus on you for a change. You work so hard and spend so much time writing about other characters falling in love. You don't leave any time for your own love story. Dating is too much of a distraction and I am perfectly happy on my own. Well, don't lose faith. You will be the next Isabella Laurence someday. The next installment of the Hopeful Romantic series? Where did you get this? I never reveal my sources. My life is made! That's good. Sam? In my office, please. Yeah. Go get 'em! Come on in, have a seat. Two words: Heather Brookes. As in the wildly famous social media influencer and daughter of New York real estate mogul, Henry Brookes? I want you to cover Ms. Brookes' destination wedding. Amazing. Where am I going? Italy? Paris? Monaco? A private Caribbean island? Everlasting Vineyards. Please tell me there's an Everlasting Vineyards in the South of France? Everlasting! It's in Everlasting, Oregon. Oh, there must be some kind of mistake because I'm actually from Everlasting, Oregon and I can assure you. There is nothing romantic there, but the name. Oh, well that's perfect. Which part? It's perfect that you're from Everlasting. You'll have the first hand intel on the hottest bachelorette brunch spots with vegan options. There's nothing like that there. See, I moved from there a few years ago and while I visit from time to time, what I actually prefer, is if my best friend and my family come to visit me here. In Seattle. Are you avoiding something? Is that how it sounds? Or someone? I just think Everlasting will be a disappointment. There's nothing Wedding Belle Magazine worthy there. You said you wanted a cover story, this is your chance. If you can make a Wedding Belle cover story out of this, you can do anything. Right... Flight leaves tomorrow. Article's due in two weeks. Are you still here? Nope... Thank you. ♪ The day is breaking softly ♪ ♪ And the night is coming true ♪ ♪ I feel a million eyes ♪ But I can just see you ♪ No rain, no thunder ♪ There's just your light, your voice ♪ Excuse me? Are you Liam Hawthorne? That I am, little man. Wow... You're my favorite baseball player of all time! Wow! Can you sign this? Oh yeah, of course buddy. What's your name? Cooper. Cooper? You gonna come to baseball tryouts this weekend, Cooper? Yes, I'm really excited. Awesome. Thank you, Liam. Of course! Have a good day, guys. Thank you. I can't believe it! My daughter is home for two whole weeks. Never thought I'd see the day, not that I'm complaining. I thought you loved coming to visit me in the city. I love any excuse to be with you. And to shop. How else would I outdress the ladies at our weekly brunch? You know your mother, she's a city girl like you. But she fell in love with the... Mayor of a small town. And I wouldn't change it for the world. You two are just as adorable as ever. It's great to have you home, sweetheart. - Thank you. - Come in, make yourself at home. You know what? I'm going to come in for a quick tea and then I have to get going. I want to surprise Julie and I just want to get a head start on this Everlasting Vineyard article. About that... If you're going to bring up what's-his-name... Liam Hawthorne? I prefer to call him what's-his-name. Of all the vineyards in all the world... I end up at this one, I know. What a coincidence. But you should probably know... It's fine, Mom. Thank you for caring, but that's in the past. It's been so many years since I've seen him. I have no intention of stirring it up now that I'm back for a bit. I'm just going to write my article and wow my boss, and become the romance novelist I was always meant to be. It is strictly business. Sounds like you've got everything all mapped out. We're so proud of you. Are you going to be home for dinner? I can't wait. Is my bike still in the garage? Dad fixed the flat this morning. Of course he did! Oh, I missed you guys! It's so good to see you. Okay, how's that? It's slightly crooked, isn't it? Not if you tilt your head like that. But tell you what. If you've got a level, I can make this work. A level? I have one in the back. - Let me show you. - Lead the way. Oh, I'm so... Sam? Liam, great. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, let me... I got this. Those are... Thank you. Those are yours, and... Yup... thanks! Still walking and reading, I see? Old habits die hard. It's a pretty irresponsible habit. Not to mention, dangerous. You could walk into traffic and not even know it. Traffic? In Everlasting? It just takes one car. Well, it's a good thing I take the sidewalk. Right. What are you doing back in Everlasting? I was going to ask you the same thing. I live here. You do? Yeah. Oh, one more page. "Lady Jane longed for his touch, it felt like an eternity since he was drafted..." Has no one ever told you that it's rude to snoop? I wasn't snooping, I was just reading. What happens now? Now, I'm late for a meeting. No, I meant with Lady Jane there. I haven't written that part yet. What's so funny? You just... You got... Just a petal. Oh... But you haven't changed a bit. Is that so? Yeah, might wanna try looking up every once and a while. Thank you for that advice. If you'll excuse me... Oh, if you'll excuse me. - You're excused. - Have a great day. You too. Julie... Sammy! Welcome to Birds and Bees. How can we make your floral dreams come true today? Wow, that is quite the mouth full. It's a bit much, isn't it? I'm working on a new greeting. Look at how you've turned this place around. Honestly, I couldn't have done it without Aleks' help. Oh, hi. Hey Sam, how are you? I'm great. Okay, found the level. It's a little small, but it'll work. I gotta go. What are you doing here? You'll never guess. You have come to toast your very best friend on her grand re-opening, and you brought a handsome city boy as your date? Exactly! Minus the date. And also, I've been assigned a potential cover story. What? That's amazing! On Everlasting Vineyards. Oh, that's not amazing. Because of Liam? Yeah, you know? Yeah, I literally just ran right into him. And? It's fine. It is? Yeah, I don't even want to talk about it. Of course you don't. What happened between us is ancient history. Here's the thing... Julie, I have moved on. I just want to write my article and toast my amazing best friend on her grand re-opening. I'm so excited to see you. Me too! Okay, I have to head to the vineyard, but I'll come by later? Sounds great. - Bye, Sam. - Bye, Aleks! Wow, she's handling the news about Liam pretty well, I'd say. Yeah, I don't think she knows. Oh... Of course I want to make that happen, but I'm going to need Heidi's hairstylist if I'm going to achieve that kind of volume. Are these all the samples you could find? I'll have more shipped. Yeah. Okay... Okay honey, I'll talk to you later. Alright, bye! Wow, there's really good lighting in here. Chase? Snap for social. Excuse me? Hi, would you mind helping us with the photo? For sure. Oh no. Hold the samples? He knows my best angles. He does this literally all day. Chase, okay. 1-2-3! Ready? Okay. Okay great, one of those will work. Thank you so much. Where would you like these? Anywhere is fine. Wait! I'm Sam Hart from Wedding Belle Magazine. Oh my goodness! Why didn't you say anything before? I'm Heather Brookes, bride-to-be. We are so excited to have you here! We are such big fans of Wedding Belle Magazine. I'm Chase. This is my assistant, Chase. I just said that! Let's get a photo! Me? Yeah, here. Smile, but just close your mouth. Ready? Chase, no. Okay, 1-2-3. Okay great. Wonderful. Amazing. It's the photographer again. Try to talk him down from five assistants to three. Sorry, my fiancé is going to lose it if I can't get these numbers down. Wow, Sam Hart! I'm actually a really big fan of yours. Really? Oh, yeah! Reading artisanal food and wine pairings is my secret obsession. Wedding Belle Magazine is so excited to be doing this article. We are huge fans of your Instagram account. Your content is so fresh, it's like anything you do goes viral. I cannot tell you how many of my followers are already using the hashtag Boutique Vineyard Wedding Chic. That's great. I am thrilled to be here. I can't wait for you to meet the groom. Me too! Tell me about the lucky guy. Well, he is all the things. Smart, handsome, total dream. And he's very photogenic. You are going to love him. Oh, honey! Sam, this is my handsome groom, Liam Hawthorne. Liam? Hey again. You're the... The groom, yeah. I'm sorry, do you two know each other? - Not really. - Yes. I grew up in Everlasting, so... Yeah, we kinda go way back. It was a long time ago. Yeah, it was high school. So far back I can hardly remember. College. - It's ancient history. - Yeah. You're here doing the article? Honey, I told you Wedding Belle Magazine was sending a writer to do the article. Yeah. Pardon me, it's New York. New York... So you're getting married? Yeah, I am. Getting married. And you're doing the article? I am, I am doing the article. Great... Well, you look good. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, you just look grown up. Well, it has been a really long time. Years. Yeah... Don't do that. Do what? That thing where you smile, but you mean something else. I have no idea what you're talking about. Right... Excuse me. It's so rude, but you know how it is. When New York calls, you have to answer, am I right? Come, let me show you the vineyard. Well, she's actually seen the vineyard before. It's been ages, I'm sure a lot has changed. I wish it would change more. I can show you the places where we're doing the individual events. The vineyard is the perfect backdrop for photos. Yeah. I'm so sorry, I'm going to go make a really quick phone call. Oh, by all means. Go for it. I love her, she's perfect. Hello? Hi, I can't do the article. And why on earth not? Because I have personal history with the groom. It's a conflict of interest. And? And he's someone I used to date. - And? - And I think I need to back out. How about an article about a flower shop? No. No? Did you think that writing a Wedding Belle cover story was going to be easy? No, of course not... Then you need to put your personal differences aside and deliver the story. Okay. Write the story, or lose the best opportunity Wedding Belle Magazine has ever offered to you. If you're nodding, I can't see you. Right. Are you nodding? Yeah. I just... No. - I can't... - Who's that? Okay... Honey! Umm, it's looking like we're going to need to invite a few more people. Okay. A few more, like five? A few more, like 50? 50? Come on, I thought we said 50 guests max. I know, but I've already sent out invitations, I can't un-invite people. I guess not, but I just don't know if the vineyard can handle that many people. There are some very important influencers and industry people attending. Not to mention Jake Jacobs essentially postponed fashion week for us. Yeah, Jake Jacobs... right. Look, I know these people don't mean much to you, but they mean the world to me. I just want this wedding to be perfect. So do I. Sorry about that. When Seattle calls, you gotta take it, am I right? Heather? I don't... You know what? We will see each other tomorrow. I would love it if we could get an early start. Sounds great. Perfect. Are you sure you're okay to take your bike home? Liam could give you a ride. Oh no, I'm fine thank you. Okay, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. I've got practice. Okay, have fun. Chase! Sam? You've got company. I was completely caught off guard. How did no one tell me that Liam was the groom? I think we tried. - You did? - A few times. - Really? A few times? - Yeah. I thought this was my shot at a cover story, but now I don't think I can pull this off. Because Heather's not right for him? No, she seems lovely. Sure, just not who I thought Liam would end up with. You know he's only known her for less than a year? None of my business. I know, I'm just saying. How am I supposed to write an article about someone I have this kind of past with? Did you talk about what happened? No. Why not? You guys were always friends first. Did it change that much when you stared dating? I guess it changed when I got my scholarship in San Francisco. Right, and that's also when Liam got recruited to play ball in New York. Yeah, we decided to take a temporary break to pursue our dreams and if we still felt the same way about each other at the end of the year, we would meet back up at the vineyard on our anniversary. How romantic! Sure, except I showed up and he didn't. - No way! - Yeah. How did you not tell me this? I didn't tell anyone. I was embarrassed and heartbroken. You poor thing. And then by the time I got the courage to reach out, I saw this picture of him in the paper. What picture? A picture of him with his arm around another girl. I'm sorry, Sam. He had obviously moved on, so I figured I should too. That's when I got my apartment in Seattle. Last year, when the fire happened and I had to close the flower shop, I was devastated. I didn't know how I was going to repair the damage and reopen again. But courage comes from unexpected places. You're strong, Sam, but you need to face your past. I mean he's getting married now, it doesn't really matter. It does matter! You've been holding onto this with Liam for way too long. Maybe it's time you need to forgive him. Forgive him? Let it go. So you can continue on your chosen path and be the amazing writer you were born to be and write the best cover story Wedding Belle Magazine has ever seen. You're right. Of course I'm right! Wait, which part am I right about? I need to start fresh. Forgive him. Really? Yeah - forgive Liam. Easy peasy. Well, it's not that easy. It is! Tomorrow I'm going to close the chapter, I'll leave it behind and write the best article Wedding Belle Magazine has ever seen. - Okay? - Okay. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. I noticed the back patio could use a couple more planters, so I'll go to the flower shop today, pick some stuff up. You want me to grab you anything? From the flower shop? Yeah, I don't mind going. I think I'm okay, but Mom definitely loves all the plants you added this year, so I say go for it, bro. Okay. - Good morning Aleks! - Morning Sam. - Comin' in hot. - No. No? I'm gonna go. I have something to say. Okay, what is it? We're grown ups now, right? Yeah, last I checked. And as grown ups, I think we should act as such. Okay. I would like to put the past in the past, where it belongs, and put the present where it belongs... In the present? Yes, that's why they call it... never mind. I would like to move forward by saying the thing that needs to be said. The thing? Yes, and the thing is... I want to move past our history and write you a wonderful article. And... I forgive you. You forgive me? Yes. You're welcome. Wow, okay. You know what? Here's my thing. You have a thing now? I do, yeah. I didn't do anything wrong. You essentially ghosted our relationship before ghosting was even a thing. Are you kidding me? You're the one who became a ghost when you didn't come back to Everlasting. I had a career I was trying to pursue. Okay well, congratulations! Same to you. Great, have a good day. - You too, bye. - Bye. And that's just me letting you in on a little secret that I've never told anyone before. And as a Manhattan girl, I never thought I would end up in Everlasting, but here I am. And here she is. Sam is writing our Wedding Belle Magazine article. Say hi, Sam. Hi. Alright, I will see everybody for another live session at 5pm. Kisses! The life of a vlogger! I am so excited to get started, I have the perfect spot for our interview. Sounds great, lead the way. Hang on. Hi Chase. Uh-huh... yep... Yes, he can bring his private jet, there's a landing strip around here somewhere. Well then you better find one, mister! So, this is where we'll all be tasting the "Heather and Liam Forever" Wedding Blend. It's perfect. And these are my selects for the wine label photos. Oh wow, you look incredible in every single one of them. And there's this one, too. I need the wedding to be perfect. I really need it to wow my followers. Well you couldn't have picked a better venue. I could never get tired of looking at this view. Yeah, it's beautiful, but quiet. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss the sound of traffic. - Really? - Yeah! Oh, that is one thing I do not miss! How did you two meet? Well, Liam was in the majors and he was such a rising star. But when he got injured, he came back to Everlasting to recuperate and I visited him for a summer and that is when I proposed. Oh, you proposed to Liam? Why not, it's the 21st century, right? And plus if I hadn't done it then, who knows when he would've ever gotten around to it. You know men, they don't know what they want until it's right in front of them. I can't wait for our honeymoon in St. Barts. Did you know the only three restaurants here close at 8pm? That's Happy Hour in New York. I knew you and I were gonna be fast friends! Should we get started? - Oh yeah! - Great. So what was the inspiration behind a boutique vineyard wedding? Wedding Belle Magazine issue 36. That French Vineyard Farmhouse Wedding has been on my dream board since high-school. I know the one. Oh, it's the dress designer. Do you mind? Not at all, go ahead. Hello? Hi. What? No, no! Oh my gosh, you have got to be kidding me. Okay, yeah. Okay, I will get on the next flight out. Everything okay? There's been a dress emergency. The vintage lace has literally disintegrated in the alteration. I am so sorry, but we're going to have to re-schedule. I need to get on a plane immediately. Liam! There you are! Ah, well if it isn't my favorite writer. To what do I owe the pleasure? Need a hand? I think I'm good, but thanks. Are you sure? Four's better than two. Why do I get the feeling there's something else you want to ask me? Okay, look. I know we got off to a bit of a rocky start, but I really am happy for you and I want this article to be the best it can be and since I lost the bride for the moment, what would be amazing is if I could get an interview with the groom. Ooh, not a chance. It's an article about a wedding. Half of the wedding is in New York. You're the other half. The article is really Heather's thing. People love to hear about the groom. Well, people love mystery. Not that much mystery. Look, it's a painless 25 questions. 20? 15? Look, even if I had the time, which I don't, I wouldn't give you the interview, because I can't, okay? Sure you can. I can't, because Aleks and I are getting the vineyard ready for the wedding. If there's no vineyard, there's no wedding and if there's no wedding, there's no article. Plus I'm really bad with interviews. That's because you haven't interviewed with me yet. Five questions? I'll think about it. I'll take it. You want a break, man? No I'm good, just gonna keep working. You know me, I could never get enough of this view. Oh man, I see it every day and I don't think I'll ever get sick of it. Yeah, they don't have all this in New York. You good? I'm good, why? Oh, no reason. Wait, there is a reason. Sam? Remember her, that girl you're in love with? Don't. Now she's back and you're being weird. - It's in the past. - Oh, it's in the past? Okay, I'm just asking. That's the second grape you've thrown at me, by the way. I'm keeping track. Welcome to Birds and Bees. How can we make your future pollination supplier needs come true today? Too abstract? Still a mouth full. It's not bad, but maybe try something simpler. - Welcome! - Perfect! Thought you could use a midday coffee break. Two sugar, two cream. Just how I like it, thank you. I cannot believe how much you've accomplished. You must spend all of your time here. You literally spend all your time here. Maybe it's time to find some more balance. Get back to dating? I don't know if I'm ready, man. I know, but... You know, it's been years since Christie passed. Yeah. And I know she'd want me to start dating again. She would. I mean, you'd want the same for her, right? I don't like it when you're right. I don't hear that very often. You know what doesn't happen very often? Daisies and tulips in the same arrangement? Yes, and also a wedding article with no bride and no groom. What happened? Bride got called to New York and the groom refuses to give me an interview. Sounds like you need to figure out how to make the best use of your time. Is panicking an option? Because I have a week and a half to get this thing done. If only there was a way you could trick Liam into doing the article. Oh, I tried. He knows me too well. What about an interview with the best man. A brother's perspective? Speaking of the best man, I noticed Aleks has been hanging around here a lot. Yeah, he likes flowers. She sells flowers, we need to buy flowers. We do need to buy flowers. And planters and soil and apparently everything else in between. Because the landscaping around here has never looked better. Yeah, you're welcome for that, by the way. Listen, Julie says I have a green thumb. Does she now? Yeah she does, okay? I see the way he looks at you. Do you now? I think he likes you. Likes-you, likes you. Sam! It's like he's Mr. Darcy and you're his Elizabeth. Classic romance writer! There's nothing between Aleks and I. Are you absolutely sure? Pretty sure. That's not absolutely. Plus, I don't think he's ready to move on. He still wears his wedding ring. I mean, it's been six years since his wife passed. Still, I don't think he's interested. I think we're in the friend zone. Are you interested in being outside the friend zone? No. Truly? Yes, I want to be outside the friend zone. I have such a crush on him, I can't stand it. I knew it! I don't think she's interested. Hey, we've become decent friends. She sure is easy to talk to. I don't if that's a good thing. It kind of sounds like you're in the friend zone. It does sound like I'm in the friend zone. You like her, right? Yes, I like her. - So ask her out! - But what if she says no? What if she says yes? - But what if she says no? - What if she says yes? She's going to say no. She might say yes! Let's just say if he were to ask me out, I'd probably say yes. I know, he just makes my day. Maybe the time is right. Let's hope, he's a really great guy. Yes, he is. Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne! Welcome to Birds and Bees! Nice to see you, Julie. And Sam, we heard you were in town. It is so good to see you two. It's been a long time! Look at you, you haven't changed a bit. I could say the same about you. Oh, stop. We came to pick up flower samples for Heather. I'm afraid they're not quite ready. She just called and changed them again. I'll deliver them myself tomorrow. She does like to change her mind. Good thing she's settled on just the one groom. George! Would you like to come to dinner at the vineyard tonight? I believe Liam will also be joining us. I can't tonight, but thanks for the offer. You know what? I would love to join you for dinner. - Excellent. - Fantastic, we'll see you then. - Sounds great. - Bye. We'll see you tonight. You know, it's so nice to see vineyard so busy. I bet you the reeds are down there. Remember the talent night you two put together? That's right. Was it Memorial Day? It was the 4th of July. I'll never forget it. Yes, and you two sang a version of... Chicago's "Saturday in the Park," but Sam changed the words to... "Vineyard in the Park." Yeah. That's right. And you were wonderful! I sang off key. Come on, you were perfect. I sang off key. That is not how I remember it. You did get a standing ovation. Remember that? He's right. It seems like yesterday the boys were little. We had just taken over the vineyard from George's parents and now we're close to retirement. Time goes by so fast. What is going to happen to the vineyard now that you two are thinking about retiring? We are hoping that Aleks, Liam and Heather will carry on the family tradition. Okay, how does Heather feel about that? We're working on it. Sam, we are so thrilled for you and your writing career. It seems like it's really taking off. Thank you. I am actually working on finishing a novel, that's the real goal. I'm hoping that this article will be a bit of a stepping stone. You always had a gift for words. In fact, we're still using the brochures that you wrote for the vineyard back in college. Oh, wow! I think my writing skill has improved since then, at least I hope it has. You know what? Our New Special Reserve could use a little "romancing". Whoa, I think I romanced it just fine, thank you. Liam, you said so yourself! I mean, I would love to. Unless of course, you want to keep what you've got. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Fine. Great. But I'm not doing that interview. Fine. Okay. Meet me here tomorrow morning, bright and early. - Can't wait. - Can't you? ♪ I've been sailing for many years ♪ ♪ Trying to find you and face my fears ♪ ♪ Yes I've been deraming ♪ Far away ♪ For that sunrise ♪ By the bay ♪ But by the sea ♪ I'm all right ♪ By the sea ♪ I'm all right ♪ By the sea I'm alive ♪ I've been wondering ♪ Where'd you go? ♪ Tried to find you ♪ On the road ♪ I crossed the waters ♪ And left my home Morning! Someone's chipper today. I'm just on board and enthusiastic about writing this article. I think that's the definition of chipper. Would you like to show me the wine? Easy tiger, okay? In order to understand and appreciate our Special Reserve, you need to see where it all starts first. We're not going inside? Not yet, come on. My family has cultivated this land for over 40 years and now it produces some of the finest grapes in the world. What kind of grapes? Literally hundreds of varieties of grapes used to make wine, but here, we specialize in... Pinot Noir, my favorite. Exactly. So this moody little grape is very particular. He likes to grow in climates that are not too tropical and not too arid. So the sweet spot is basically between 30 and 50 degrees latitude both north and south. I'm beginning to understand why you need a little romance in your descriptions. I can romance my descriptions, thank you. Can you, now? Yes, if I wanted to, yes. Oh, please do. Okay... This fine vineyard... distinguishes itself with two main characteristics. The creative use of innovation, and the orientation towards tradition and quality. Not bad. Thank you. What about this? The simple, rustic elegance of Everlasting wine create a canvas to discover the perfect Pinot." Wow. Thank you. Wine grapes are very bitter, don't eat that. Come on. - I knew that. - Yeah. George Hawthorne Sr., my grandfather, who you may or may not remember, was always very passionate about winemaking. But he was an engineer by trade, so in 1965 he gave it all up to start this winery. My grandma used to joke that he was just so stubborn, just like the Pinot grape itself. Stubbornness runs in your family, huh? Well... You don't say. Thanks. I have to say, you are the last person I ever thought I would bump into here. I had no idea you were back. Yeah, I tore my rotator cuff a year ago and couldn't play ball anymore. Right. I was really sorry to hear about that. I know playing ball meant a lot to you. Yeah, but you know, I had a good run. Coming back here to recover from my surgery, it made me see that this is the place for me. It's home. It's where my family is and it's where I want to give back to my community. I actually started a little league team. I don't know, maybe I can coach the next baseball star out of Everlasting. If anyone can do it, it's Liam Hawthorne. Coming back here... it made me fall in love with this place all over again. Yeah, I know what you mean. So, umm... The iron rich soil, and the breeze and the marine climate, it all contributes to... The making of the perfect Pinot? Exactly. What? You really light up when you talk about the vineyard. It's in my blood. Come on. You coming? Try to keep up, Hemmingway. Very funny. So these barrels were shipped here from oak forests in France by my grandparents. They add subtle little notes to the wine. And bring out the best profile and character of the fruit. How did you know that? I did my homework. Oh, well done. Where do you think you're going? The tasting room? The wine cellar. This way. Can I take over? You wanna tell me about the wine cellar? Yes, I do. Take it away. So here, we have the wine cellar. It is cold, not unlike a fridge. It's not a fridge, but... I know it's not a fridge. Really? Wine needs to be stored between 55 and 65 degrees, with no natural light. - Well done. - Thank you. Where's my prize? It's in the tasting room. Finally. You ready? I was born ready. So, the first thing you want to do is just look at the wine. What do you see? A bright, ruby color. Exactly. But that is only the beginning of the quintessential Pinot experience. You are one of the first people to taste our new Special Reserve. So you should feel very lucky. Oh, I do. Good. Now swirl the wine. I know this part. Oh, the student becomes the teacher. Shall we? Julie, hey! Hi. Aleks, hey. Is Sam still here? Oh yeah, I think they're in the tasting room. Great, thanks. Okay, no problem. Oh hey, Julie? I was going to ask you if you... have any more perennials? Yes, I have shelves of them. Just waiting to get scooped up. Oh great, I'll scoop them then. That's terrific. Good, great. - Bye. - Bye. Yeah... what? I will have absolutely no trouble romancing this description. Thanks for helping me with this. You're welcome. I feel just like you understand the history and the tradition of this place, you know? Yeah, we had a lot of really great times here, didn't we? Yeah, we did. Listen, about what happened between us, I just want to say... Sam? Hey! Sorry to interrupt, I have the flower samples for Heather and I thought I'd say hello. Not at all, we were just tasting the Special Reserve. Yeah, do you want a glass? Oh, twist my arm. Liam, it's so nice to see you relaxing. You've been working so hard here. Thanks. Well... If you ladies will excuse me. So, how's the article coming? It's going great, actually. I'm learning so much about the vineyard and I think it'll add a nice touch. That's great! No one gets Liam like you do. How's it spending time with him? It's been really nice. Anyways, you ready for your big grand re-opening? About as ready as I'll ever be. I still have a few things I need to finish up, but it's strange... What's that? I feel nervous about it for some reason. I mean, you've worked really hard at it. Being nervous doesn't have to be a bad thing, it just means that you care. I have the most amazing news. I just got you a job offer in New York! New York? With my dad's company! It's only the most elite real estate agency in the world. Heather, we agreed to live in Everlasting. I just started a little league team... Yeah, well that was before this amazing opportunity, Liam. This is like the best thing that has ever happened to us. But... But it's not what we agreed on. Just... okay, can we talk about this later? You would not believe it, I almost had to postpone the wedding because Jake Jacobs couldn't come, but it's all right, his assistants figured it out. When are you going to be back? Just a couple more days. That's all. For sure before the Welcome Dinner. You would not believe this dress. It has been a disaster. Honey, half an inch. Half! Liam, I have to go. Heather, wait... So, are you going to ask Aleks? On a date? I couldn't do that. I was referring to the grand opening party, but wow, someone has a serious crush brewing. Stop. I do not. Are you going to take Liam? I think it would be good for him, but he's preoccupied with work and the wedding, so... Bring him - the guy needs a break. I just hope he's not rushing into anything. Julie... I know, he just seems more stressed than normal. The wedding, it all seemed to happen so fast. Still, it's not our place. Hey! Liam! Everything okay? Yeah... I just, I got a job offer in New York. Is that a good thing? I don't know, I think I need to think about it. Yeah, that's a really big decision. And you just started getting settled here. Yeah, sometimes I kind of feel like this wedding is taking on a life of its own. Funny how that can happen. Well cheers, to old friends and new beginnings. Cheers! Bursting with brilliant fruit, with subtle tones of earth, vanilla, and toasted oak, this Pinot Noir offers the perfect balance of richness and elegance. In a word, Everlasting Vineyard's Special Reserve Pinot Noir possesses all the notes of a place called home. Wow. It's nothing really. Why do you do that? Do what? You can't take a compliment. It's not like I'm Shakespeare or anything. Oh really? I thought you were Shakespeare. You're hilarious. Stop doubting yourself, okay? You clearly have a gift, you always have. Thank you. You're welcome. Anyway, the wine speaks for itself. Yeah... yeah, it's pretty grape. I see what you did there. And you know what? If this magazine career doesn't work out for you, then you might have a fruitful career... Oh, wow! Okay, are you done? Sorry, I was just... I've been bottling all this wine talk for so long. Glad I could help. Puns, please keep them coming. I'm empty. You know, you didn't even try to squeeze in the interview. I know how much this vineyard means to you and your family and I might have picked up a thing or two for my article. This article is really important to you, isn't it? Yeah, it's only the biggest opportunity of my career so far. Okay, meet me in the dining room in an hour. Does this mean what I think it does? Maybe... Maybe. Okay, have a seat. Not quite so fast. I have one more favor to ask. Off the record. I have a confession to make. It's something I've never told anyone. Okay... I have two left feet. And I promised Heather that - don't laugh! I promised Heather that I would take dance lessons. Heather actually thinks I've been taking dancing lessons for three months, but I've been too busy to squeeze them in, so here we are. Okay. I hate to break it to you, that's not a secret. Everyone knows you're not exactly a ballroom dancer. Thanks for sugarcoating that. I can't dance and everyone knows it - that's great. Not everyone, just everyone in Everlasting. Really? Really. I don't know, I was just hoping that maybe you could teach me a few basics. Basics? Just enough so that I don't make a fool out of myself at my own wedding? Oh, you're just wanting me to deliver the impossible. Wow, okay. Look if you can do this for me, then I will give you a full interview for your article, okay? No holds barred, you can ask me anything. Deal. Deal. Sorry. Okay, so this is a basic step touch. Try to keep up. Just this. Step-touch. Step-touch. But to the rhythm. To the rhythm. Don't look at the floor. Right. Not at the ceiling, at your partner. - Ow! - Sorry. It's okay, you're doing great. Why don't we try adding a little dip? Dip? I can do that. I don't know if you remember, but the dip is actually my specialty. Oh, I remember. Remember this? Couldn't forget it. Burnt in my memory. Was it as painfully awkward as I remember? I think we're good, got it. Pretend I'm your partner. - Heather? - Or any partner. I'm gonna put my hands on your shoulders, okay? Yeah. Good? Yeah, that's good. May I? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Don't look down. Look at me. Yeah, uh... Not as hard as I thought it was going to be. - Yeah, you got this. - It was easy. You're a natural. - You hungry? - Starving. Remember when we snuck in here and ate all those red velvet cake samples? You know they were for the Reid's anniversary party, right? Yeah, I thought they were leftovers. Yeah I know, because I'm the one who took them out of the fridge for you. I didn't know they were for the actual party. Yeah, the Reids were not impressed. But that is still the best cake I've ever had in my entire life. It better be, because I got in so much trouble for that. But I mean, despite the Cake Fiasco, as I remember the Reids had a pretty legendary anniversary party. That was a seriously fun summer. Sometimes I wish I could go back and relive those memories. Yeah, I know what you mean. You haven't changed a bit. How do you mean? You always used to save your strawberries for last. Oh no... What? We are late for Julie's Grand Re-Opening! Here we go! Hey Julie. Hi Aleks, your parents just left! Oh yeah, I saw them. You clean up really nice. Oh, thanks. You do too. Thank you. The place looks amazing. You've really done a great job with it. I couldn't have done it without you. I mean, your help. You know. Yeah. Hey... I was wondering... Yes? Do you... do all the floral arrangements yourself, or... how does that work? Oh. Well, Sam helps me with some of the arrangements. Right, yeah, of course she would, yeah. You were busy and I needed some help. Yeah, that makes sense. I would've, but I was... Of course you would have. You were busy and you're so helpful, all the time. Yeah, anytime. Hey, speak of the devil. - Hey guys. - Hey. Look at this! I knew it would be a success. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm just so glad you guys made it. Wouldn't miss it for the world. Look at you four. The gang is all together again. Mrs. Hart, good to see you again. Julie, you must have worked very hard really hard on this. This is amazing. Yeah, it takes a village. But I definitely didn't do on my own. Well, some of the ladies are here for my weekly brunch, so I'm going to go mingle. And I brought wine. We brought wine! Thanks, do you mind popping it on the table right over there? All right. So Aleks cleans up nice. Doesn't he? He looks so handsome, I can't stand it. Do you see the way he's looking at you? How? I am definitely getting some more-than-friends vibes here. I noticed today he isn't wearing his wedding ring. Could be a sign. I don't want to get my hopes up. Of course not. Maybe he forgot it at home. Julie, everyone deserves a second chance at love. They do, don't they? Yes, and when he looks at you, he looks at you like you're... The only woman in the room? Is it obvious? No, it's not obvious at all. - Okay good. - No, it's super obvious. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Man... You know what, I think I'm gonna ask her out. - Yeah? - Yeah, that's a good idea right? Yeah, I mean why are you even asking me? Yes. I haven't been on a date in six years, you're about to get married. Don't you know everything about this? I definitely don't know everything about this. Well, you could've fooled me. Thanks. Oh, idea! I should invite her to your wedding! - That's a good idea, right? - Yes. Yeah, okay. Speaking of your wedding, how's all the planning going? It's kind of turning into this whole social media thing and you know me, I'm more of a private person. That you are. Plus, Heather's dad kind of offered me a job in New York. Wait what, really? Yeah. Hold on, I thought she was supposed to move here after the wedding. So did I - that was our agreement, but now I'm starting to wonder if moving here is really what Heather wants at all. Well, what do you want? I'm starting to question that myself. I mean, you did meet Heather at a different part of your life, right? You were in New York, you were playing baseball and you were chasing your dream. Yeah, but she stuck with me after the injury. I know that the vineyard isn't exactly Heather's speed. Have you spoken to her about it? She's been so preoccupied with wedding stuff. So what about Sam? What about Sam? I'm just saying, what's it like having her around again? It's been... Seeing Sam again has been... Sam is the past. Okay. I still don't understand what happened with you guys. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could please get your attention. Thank you. I would like to make a toast to the woman who made tonight possible, my oldest and dearest friend, Julie. As all of you know, Birds & Bees suffered a tragic fire a year ago and it was devastating. But Julie, the forever optimist, wasted no time in rebuilding. And just look at all that she accomplished. Julie and I don't get to spend nearly as much time together as we would like, but when we do, it's like no time has passed. That's how I feel about Everlasting. Being back here has reminded me just how really, truly special this place is. The people are the heart and soul of this place and this flower shop wouldn't be here without you. Birds and Bees would not be here without your support and I don't know where I would be without my best friend. So if you could all please join me in a toast, to Julie. Cheers. Honey, that was such a great speech. I'm so proud of you. Mom, thank you! - I love you. - I love you. Hey, Julie... Yes? I need to ask you something. I was... I was wondering if you wanted to go out on a date. With me. Yes! Oh, great! I've been wanting to ask you for a long time. And I've been wanting you to ask me for so long, so... My answer is yes. I would love to go on a date with you. Great. Nice speech, you must be a writer. I just spoke from the heart. It was great. Thank you. I think I'm going to make my exit. Can I walk you home? Like old times? Yeah, like old times. Okay. That was really nice. Yeah, it was. Julie was absolutely glowing, I'm so proud of her. She's always been an optimist. And you're not? I think it's my fatal flaw. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best, I guess. I think I used to be an optimist. I mean my whole life, all I ever wanted was to play in the major leagues and I put everything I had into it. Yeah. And then I finally made it and that's when I tore my rotator cuff. It was heartbreaking. But it forced me to step back and really think about what else I was passionate about. And what's that? Giving back to my community. Coaching Little League. Working with my family. What about New York? What you said in your speech, about community. It really hit home with me. I think I'm going to tell Heather that I can't take that job in New York. This is where I belong. Yeah I have to admit, coming back here was everything I never knew I needed. I avoided it for so long because of... because of the past. Yeah, me too. What? I thought about you for so long. I still don't really know what happened between us. We agreed when I got my scholarship in San Francisco and you got your chance to play ball in New York, that we would give each other space. We'd been pretty much inseparable through college. And high school. Yeah, but our first kiss wasn't until college. I count our high school graduation dance. I remember driving you to the airport and us deciding that we would give each other the year to pursue our dreams and if we still felt the same way at the end of it, that we'd meet back up. And if we did, we would meet at the vineyard lookout on our anniversary. I showed up and you didn't. No, I showed up and you didn't. What? I showed up on our anniversary... Our anniversary was August 2nd, the day of our first kiss. No, our anniversary was August 4th, the date of our first date. You trying to tell me we both showed up on different days? Why didn't you call? Because I was hurt and by the time I got the courage, I saw a picture of you in the paper with another girl. That was just a friend. I didn't move on for so long. And I tried to call, but you changed your number. Wow, it's crazy to think how different our lives would've been if one of us had just... Yeah. I guess I'm glad we finally figured it out. After all these years. Yeah, after all these... I have to go. Why, because of something I said? Yeah. When inspiration strikes, I've gotta take it. It all makes sense now. Just... hang on! ♪ Waiting out your past ♪ So face truth at last ♪ Wind through your mind ♪ Over space and time ♪ As we look through seasons that have come and gone ♪ ♪ And you wonder how we even made it this far ♪ ♪ Do you remember this time ♪ Will you remember this time ♪ This is amazing! - You really think so? - I know so. When Lady Jane tells Arthur that she's been in love with him all these years, I cried. I'm crying. Okay stop, you're going to make me cry. Promise me you'll send this. To Winslow House? Yeah? Sam, you've got to get over your fear of the past already. Okay wait, what does this have to do with my past? Do I need to spell it out for you? I guess so. Lady Jane tells Arthur she's been in love with him for 15 years. And? Arthur is supposed to marry Katherine, even though secretly he's in love with Lady Jane. I did write it, remember? You know he's in love with you, right? Liam? Liam is not in love with me. And you're in love with him. Okay, will you stop? It's written all over these pages. You're Lady Jane and you've been in love with him all these years. No, no... Okay, even if Lady Jane is me, which she isn't, it wouldn't matter. None of it matters because it's in the past. You have to tell him! Tell him what? I'm not in love with him. And even if I was, which I'm not, I wouldn't tell him because I can't. Why not? Because he's getting married, remember? Someone needs to stop Liam from making the biggest mistake of his life. That is not my place. Come on, Sam! You've poured your heart and soul into this novel. You've gotta do it in real life. This is your chance. Heather and Liam aren't meant to be together and you know it. You know what? We will agree to disagree. I have to get going. Sam! - Hey! - Hi. How'd the inspiration go? I finished my novel. Yeah? - Wow, congratulations. - Thank you. Should we get started? Yeah, sounds good. So for our wine lovers, can you tell me a little bit about this special reserve you two will be serving? I'm guessing it's a Pinot Noir? I have to admit, I always thought the wine that we would serve at my wedding would be a Pinot Noir, but we're going with a... With a? Gewurztraminer. You hate Gewurztraminer. There are plenty of redeeming qualities about Gewurztraminer. Can you give me an example? It's light and sweet and refreshing. But you prefer Pinot? I do. But I've just known Pinot longer. You know, it was the first wine we ever produced. So if you prefer Pinot, why are you going with the Gewurztraminer? Because we had empty cases of Gewurztraminer and they didn't have labels, so it was just easy to switch it over. Oh, okay. We're just gonna leave that part out because that doesn't sound very romantic at all, does it? You okay? Yeah, I'm just realizing that... Hello! Hi, honey. I wanted to surprise you earlier, but we got caught up in town trying to find a place that sells a decent oat milk latte. Wait a second, what is going on here? Oh, what? Are you interviewing him? I am. Sam, you are a genius! I don't know how you got him to crack. I need to talk to you about something. I don't want to interrupt you, but just hang tight because I want to run some things by you about the wedding. Yeah of course, we're pretty much done anyway. Okay, coffee? Thank you. Sweetheart... Guess who wants to sing at our wedding. Kip Moore? Barely Yoncé! Wow yeah, I don't know who that is. The Beyoncé cover band. They're huge for anyone who's important in weddings right now. And they book two years in advance! We need to get a stage. A stage? I thought we agreed to use the back of the dining room. Honey, Barely Yoncé can't perform in the back of a dining room. Right, yeah. So now we need a stage? You get me! You're so good. Love the blue. Maybe not the shorts next time, though. I just, okay. Sam, let's go. Chase, the bags? Sorry. Okay. No, don't help him... No, I'm sorry Chase, those are all wrong. Can you send them back, please? Lilies are my favorite. Oh, well you should have them. They're just too sweet and plain for me. I need heightened sophistication. Chase? Can you see if there are any birds of paradise in Oregon? And see if they can send us some samples. Remember: tropical extravagance. Sorry, just to confirm: Jungle Breeze? Tropical Extravagance. Got it. Sorry. So, I picked up a few cake samples. Turns out the bakeries here aren't half bad. I know I've changed my mind on this a million times, but I just... I need everything to be perfect. Yeah. Please... That is delicious. We were going to go with my favorite, a vanilla buttercream lavender, but Liam's favorite is... Red velvet. Red velvet, yes! Anyway, that's the one that polled better with my followers, so I thought I would surprise him. Therefore, out of these three red velvet cakes, which one would you choose? Me? Yeah, I value your opinion. Oh, this one. It's simple, yet classic. Great! That's another box ticked! One more thing. I know this is totally over the top, but my father has a business associate who's a Sarcofsky. Of Sarcofsky Diamonds. I just had these made for Liam. Oh, wow. Too extravagant? They'd be perfect for any event in the city. He's going to love them. I hope so. I would just really like to get him excited about the possibility of living in New York. Don't get me wrong I love Everlasting. And I could totally see myself living here, if it had all the things New York had. You might be surprised, it might grow on you. There's just something about this place. Every time I come home it sweeps me off my feet again. That's sweet. I don't know if I'm going to ever feel that way, but it's still sweet. Thanks. You've just been so helpful Sam, thank you. It's my pleasure. I think I have everything I need for today. Great! So, the photographer will be by tomorrow and the editor will send you the proofs. Amazing! And I'll see you at the Welcome Dinner tonight, right? Oh, you know what? I have so much work to do... No, you have to come! We're shipping in the lobster from New York. I can make an appearance. Great! Okay, well I will see you tonight. Looking forward to it. - Shall we? - We shall. ♪ Sam, don't you look wonderful! Thank you. So nice to see you, Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne. How stunning is this? It's like a fairy tale. At a theme park. George, stop. Well, it's true. This place couldn't fit another decoration if it tried - and this isn't even the wedding! - George! - What? Oh, look! Here they are now. Always nice to see you, Sam. Enjoy yourself! Back up, Chase! Back up! Lower... Hi! You look gorgeous. Thank you. How's the date? I'm just trying not to fall in love. Can you tell? I'm playing it cool, right? Look at this face. - I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. Hey Sam! Hi Aleks, looking good. Yeah, you do look really good. So do you. And you. You both look good - everyone looks good. Thank you. Do you know where you're sitting? Yeah, I'm... over yonder. Oh, I think we're over there with the bride and groom. - Yeah, we are. - I'll come visit you. - Please do. - Okay, shall we? - Yeah. - Okay, see you. Bye. I'll just be right back. - Hey. - Hi. Thanks for coming. Yeah, of course. I'm enjoying the people watching. You have quite the exclusive guest list. Even the lobster came from New York. - How's the Pinot? - Good. I better... Yeah. Hello everybody! Can I have everyone's attention? I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everybody for coming all the way out to this tiny little remote Vineyard in the middle of nowhere to commence a fun week of wedding celebrations! Thank you, I also have a surprise announcement to make. Dramatic pause. I got Liam a job in New York! My dad agreed to take him on at Real Estate East! So, as soon as the wedding is over, Liam and I are both moving to Manhattan! So congratulations to my very handsome, almost-husband, Liam! Honey, we have our lives to talk about this. Right now, we have guests to entertain. Speaking of, I think this might be the perfect opportunity for a photo op with Jake Jacobs. - Okay. - Okay, let's go. If you'll excuse me. Okay, let's talk. I can't take that job in New York with your dad. Honey... Look, you went behind my back and you got it without even asking me! I know, I just... I can't stay in Everlasting, Liam. I don't feel like myself when I'm here. I thought all the excitement around the wedding and engagement would change things, but... I don't know, these last few days in New York have made me see that that is where we're supposed to be. Maybe you, but not me. That's not what I want. Well, what do you want? I mean you never really tell me, so I just assume you're okay with me always taking the lead. I guess I've just been trying to figure it out. You know what I think this is? I think it's just really hard to move away from home. Believe me, I know. I felt the exact same way when I left New York, it was awful. Maybe you shouldn't have to feel that way. What do you mean? After baseball, I didn't even know who I was anymore. Not until I got back here, not until I got home. But you, you have always known exactly who you are and you always knew exactly where you needed to be. And that's not Everlasting. I don't think so. I really tried to love it here, you know? I know. You were great. It's just so small. And quiet. Plus, I've already exhausted all the good photo ops. So what do we do now? Now we break it to Chase that he might have to re-pack all your suitcases. Trust me, he won't mind. Well, if you're ever in New York, don't be a stranger. We'll get dinner with Jake Jacobs. Speaking of which, I guess we should inform our guests of the news. Yeah, they'll be fine. They're eating lobster, so... - From New York. - From New York! Come in. I thought I'd bring some tea for my hard-working daughter. Thanks, Mom. How's it all going? I can't go to the wedding. No? I can't watch Liam marry someone else and write an authentic article. Oh honey, I'm so sorry. Yeah, this is supposed to be the biggest opportunity of my career. I didn't think I'd be going home without a story. When your father and I met, I was certain I was a city girl, through and through. But he was charming and I fell in love with him and moved here to Everlasting. Turns out it was the best decision I ever made. Life doesn't always go according to plan. I think I'm going to be fired. Why don't you write the article that you want to write? What do you have to lose? You're right. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome, sweetheart. I can't believe I'm flying home tomorrow. Feels like I just got here. Does this mean you're going to come home more often now? I kind of don't want to leave. - Love you. - I love you. Thank you. ♪ There's a familiar feeling in Everlasting that no amount of money can buy. It's the feeling of coming home. You are so talented. I am so about to be fired. So it's not a cookie-cutter Wedding Belle Magazine article. It's good writing - that's what matters. Is it though? Yeah, you're going to be fine. I promise. Sam? My office, please? No seriously, it's good. - Okay, wish me luck. - You got this. Good morning! Right. Okay look, I know this wasn't exactly what you were looking for... No, it isn't. It's better. This piece is very good. It is? Yes. Don't get me wrong, it's not the cover. It's not. No, but I want you at this Friday's board meeting with pitches for next month's cover. Okay, I see. In the meantime, if you could romance a quick few hundred words on gluten-free bagels and carrot lox, the whole thing. It is a fad. You still here? No. That's what I thought. No! I'm really grateful for the opportunity, but after four enlightening years at Wedding Belle Magazine, I think it's time for me to move on. Did Hans at Veiled Intentions give you a better offer? No. No, I'm going to write romance novels. Oh, that's disappointing. Okay. Sam! You're very talented. Make us proud. Good luck. Thank you. You'll be missed. Not that much, but a lot. You'll be missed. Yes, I know the wedding is postponed. Uh, may I speak with Samantha Hart? Speaking? This is Charles Harrington, from Winslow House Publishing. We read your manuscript, "Everlasting Love" and quite frankly, we loved it. We have a new imprint that highlights fresh voices and Samantha Hart is a new voice that we'd love to highlight. I feel like a sequel is in the midst. Welcome to Birds and... - Sam? - Honey, I'm home! Wait, you are? Are you here to stay? You are looking at Everlasting's newest soon-to-be published author. Winslow House is interested in the novel. They gave me notes and they want more. Does that mean there's a sequel in our midst? I guess we'll have to find out. I can't say I'm the least bit surprised. I can't wait to read your sequel. You'll be the first to read it. I decided to come home. Everlasting seems to be where I'm most inspired. Right. About that. Is this about Liam? It is. - You know? - Yeah, it's fine. It is? Because I was gonna say... He's right behind you. - Liam? - Sam. What are you... Just, before you say anything... Come with me. There's something I want to show you. I called off the wedding and then I went to your parents' house looking for you, but you had already left town. So I flew to Seattle. You did? Yeah, and then I went to your magazine office and I met... Anne, is it? She tried to sell me on a tell-all. Interesting woman. Yeah, she is. After your office, I went to your apartment. I love you. I have always loved you. It's always been you. You've always been the one, too.
