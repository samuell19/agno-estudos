I caught Olga rummaging through my papers. I was upset! Look at that shot. Amazing! Borg had a serve that was very good. Watch the slow motion. Of course it is good We've gotta hurry if you don't want to miss the beginning. Damien, let's go! Pierre? - Yes? Are you coming? - Yes. Olga! Securely close it behind you when you leave... OK? Good evening! Look at your sister! You saw that, too? There has been some progress! - Yes! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I'm sure I left the car open. I'll go check. Are you crazy! Hurry up! The match between Borg and McEnroe just ended. Borg won the match... It is still finite, Borg! - Damn! What are you doing in my car? - Your back door was not locked. I was told that I would find you in your car Speak in French. Look ahead. It will appear more normal. You never know. How is Jacques? Good. Very good. He told me to tell you, that the French Embassies in the countries of Eastern Europe... ...are open, to you and your family But I don't want to leave! This is my country. Now, I have some important things for you. 15 top leaders of the West have... been working for us. For a longtime... You see, your classmates in the DST will love you. I don't work for the DST! You don't work for the secret service? Of course not! I work here in Moscow, for Thomsons. Jacques is my boss. He just asked me to tell you, about the embassies. That's unbelievable! They sent me an amateur. It's very French. Is that what you are saying... - You really want to stay in Moscow? I will not flee like the others. It's pathetic! I'm not afraid to die. My country needs me. I can change the world. Tell Jacques I don't want to talk to anyone. What I have done, should be worth something to guys like you. I'm going to leave you, because my daughter's show is going on. Lock the door before going out. Good evening. What a jerk! They are nothings, those French! Igor is back? In his room. It has taken... a warning. - Why?. He callled Brezhnev an old fart. What's the story with Brezhnev? All right! It doesn't bother you. But not in public, you idiot! There could be some trouble. Excuse me! I do not want hurt your brilliant career. Don't speak to me in that tone of voice. Go... I have things to do... What are you listening to? Western music! Don't worry, go! Your friends have shut down the shop. Bye bye, Queen! PARIS FRANCE, MAY 1981 I heard about the job in New York was about to open up. It will not be easy. There's lots of people on the list. But it's not... ...for now. Ah, here it is. Pierre Froment.. Our engineering student stationed in Moscow. Maurice Vallier, DST. How did it happen... ...Moscow? I told him the truth, I did it just to help you. He wants to talk to a professional. Your guy is a pathological liar, who thinks he can change the world. This man.. ...is a colonel. Colonel Grigoriev. He was born in Moldova, he studied... .. in Moscow, KGB used its influence at the university. He occupies a key position. Everything goes through him. He has become indispensable in processing information. Anyway... we didn't expect it. And the list of names he gave you... is unprecedented since the beginning of the Cold War. OK. Anyway, thank you... for your help. How are you... ...doing things, now? You will contact him yourself? - Certainly not! KGB had a file on me. It even has Grigoriev, who was posted in Paris. Given the turn of events, we will regain control, the... Excuse me, I am tired. Goodbye, gentlemen. Bye. WASHINGTON USA, MAISON BLANCHE As we expected... the elections in France didn't go well. Fransoa Mitterrand won with 51% of the vote. What we need to know is he does plan to have Communist ministers in his government. - God dame, France is supposed... ...to be our ally! What does Margaret Thatcher think? Never! I'll never let them do such a thing. We cannot lie on French! We just can't! Our relationship with Moscow is extremely tensened... ...and we must not be losing an ally! You were where? It has begun! In each store, at the bottom of every court... .. Behind a window, there is a granny... ...One of our brave babushkas, Simple and discreet... ...But note... ...that no one had seen. Let's drink to our babushkas... .. Our true sentinel... ...Against the attacks.. ...of the imperialists! Applause Let me introduce you to... .. Our new rookie... .. which is far from being a babushka... Alina Samarova! Thank you! Girls, a little less chattering... ...and a little more work. Who are happily marching together? Our column pioneers! Gaily, gaily, Always the right place. Leninist Pioneers. The Leninists come. Be ready! - Always ready! Be brave! - Always brave! Hay! I thought. ...it should work... ...together. Paris sent someone to see me. From the airport, we knew who came. It will never work! Are you sick or what? There is no danger. Nobody in KGB is interested in you. You are already in Moscow, Your assignment folder is empty. Or almost. You could avoid marrying... ...a former East German. But hey! She went to the West in '57. She was 8 years old. Have to go. Make some copies of these documents and bring them to me... ...to the Novoslobodskaya station. on Thursday! No, but... wait! Wait! No, but it's incredible! - Shh! The plans for the shuttle Columbia. It's crazy! Look, the notes by the Russian researchers. They believe that the fuselage will not avoid overheating... ...when it starts its re-entry in the atmosphere. Look! The route of French nuclear submarines for the next 6 months! Damn! But why? Why you? I know, me? Maybe they mistook me for someone else. We must get rid of all that, fast! It is not possible. Wait, this is very serious. - Be quiet! We will not throw... documents we can only dream of... agents of the West! It's not your problem. I married an engineer, not James Bond. Perhaps I can ask Jacques if... What will Jacques get on the inside? He provided occasional services to the DST What? I know that over the past three months... your boss passed along messages for the Secret Service, and by chance... there was Russian tote in your car with secret documents. You're not telling me everything, Peter. You think we're all spies here at Thomson? Jacques does what he wants with the DST? I see nothing in all this. I sure hope so, because we're in the lion's mouth in Moscow. If you don't want to endanger your family, burn it all and forget everything. Forget it! OK, you're right. Tomorrow, I will get rid of it all. What is the level of the source? Uh... Level One. We believe that the source will continue to be engaged. We have planted a cell within the DST. Why is the DST dealing with this matter? The source was stationed here in Paris... ...from 1965 to 1970. and it was during this time that we made the approach... we sent a signal... ...there was three months. If this case is assigned to our colleagues operating abroad... ...we will lose contact. The external espionage service is totally infiltrated by the KGB. The Russians have not infiltrated the DST, because it seemed unnecessary to them. We do not have to intervene outside the national territory. Glad to hear you say that, Mr. Director. Continue to follow this case... and report to me personally, because I agree with you on one point the fewer people involved ...the better. I can provide a cover for you, while I can count on your loyalty .. and my respect. Mr. President, I have devoted my life to the defense of the interests of France. You can go. Mr. President. What did he put at the... ...top of the document? One moment. The code name of the source... "Farewell", which means "farewell". And why not "Farewell? - The Russians... ...think like the CIA, it will allow us gain a little time. Come in. MONTEBELLO, CANADA G7 MEETING, JULY 1981 United States cannot accept Communist ministers... ...in Western Europe. Or in any free country. So I ask you, in the interests of freedom... We meet... .. to review the makeup of your government. I was elected by a free people... .. On the basis of a platform I will implement... ...and I will fight... ...all forms of foreign interference to guarantee to the people of France... ...the freedom to choose their own destiny. Without interference... ...in American affairs, I think... ...I'm a sincere ally of the United States... .. and I bring this to your attention. A top-level source sent us this list. There are fifteen U.S. citizens working with NASA, the CIA.. Pentagon... and the White House. Everything indicates that they have a direct link with Moscow. - Now, between the two of us you know... I was going to do a film with Ford.. it never happened, due to a mix-up with the studio. I can't remember any more Mr. President, it's getting late... I do not trust Mitterrand. He is just making waves to buy some time with his Communist ministers. This Farewell business.. This is bogus. - I sincerely hope, sir. If this proves to be true... - The last two names on this list. I want to know them before I get back to Washington. The last two names? Not a word to Feeney about this! If he found out I was snooping behind his back... He may be the CIA boss, but I'm the boss of the United States. Ah The Pentagon! It's good, eh? I've put the... .. plans... ...of Air Force One It's funny. For your consideration. How you doing? For the documents, all that they asked me was how much you want. You will become a little spy. Suspicion. No, I can assure you the contact will find another solution in a while. So, how much you want? - Money, money! What I can give you is priceless! I will tell them. Keep your money... ...And bring me some cognac and champagne from Paris They will all ask about the bottles in my office. That will be the day there will no longer be... birds chirping It is not easy to speak in Russian? I like to speak French and who can I talk to, if not you? It would be more practical, anyway. The next time I'll bring the champagne. You French are chauvinists. So are we. I got my engineering degree here... in 1955. And my son Igor will be... an engineer here also. You are always in love... ...Your wife? Yes, of course We all love our women, but in our own way. You can return to Igor... ...Johnny Walkman? - "Johnny Walkman"? I don't know that. Sony! A Sony walkman, no? Yes... Walkman. - Yeah. Maybe Sony. And the group... Cassettes of the American group "The Kin". - "Kin"? No, Queen! They are English. Queen. "We will, we will rock you" Perhaps, yes. - You don't know? You like that? Yeah, that?s fine. Me, I love Ferri. Ferri, that?s good! What poetry! And can you also bring me some French poems? And cassettes by Ferri? And a hundred balls and a salad Nicoise, too? Look, I'm not Fnac! Your departure and arrival times... ...are written in a notebook by the guys in the booth. And then there were two men in a Lada... who followed you... while you were driving. And the cleaning woman who searches the apartment when no one is around But people who watch... ...are not amused. If you're nice to them... they will like you a lot and they will never suspect anything. Next week same line in the subway. One last thing! What? - The French residence... ...Is bugged. You know that, I guess. Yes, I know. Especially in the ceilings So if a guy does not intend to be with his wife in bed... ...he has a girl in his sights, and there are possibilities, then... ...kiss his wife, it is the only way to keep the peace. Funny, eh? - No, it?s not funny. I'm sorry... I can't... because of Igor and also because of Serge. I... You can't spend your life sacrificing yourself for others You're unhappy, Natasha. - Enough, let's go! Dimarre, We can't be seen here! I'm tired of lies. Think of yourself first. No, we have no new name... But the source has provided us with some very important documents. What kind of documents? *They include air defense plans of the United States. *I am looking all the radar installations... *... installed on your territory since 1976... *... your coded procedures to trigger a response... *... in case of an enemy air attack. * In the margin, written in Russian... *... he has the keys to reach you at the same time. * I also have the codes to get into the White House... *... the schedules of companies delivering food and clothing. * as well as the communication codes used since 1959... *... by your embassies. I see. - I thought .. that you wouldn't come. I think it is a mistake. Me too. Smile! Remember your own wedding! Shoot me with them! OK! Of course, comrade I am a professional photographer.. Get closer. A smile! Thanks It's a good dream, communism. Yes, happiness flows on your streets. People are uplifted with joy. It's difficult to realize, that dream. You know what state Russia was in 1917? The Middle Ages. And after 40 years, it was first... ...to send a man into space. The first! Today the system is totally plugged up We must blow up the system. That's why I am giving you all this information. When the Soviet bloc will no longer exist You loot, everything will fly... ...and there will be a new revolution. I don't see that, But Igor, my son... ...it will be alive in him. That is it, my reward. Speaking of Igor, I have taken back the things you asked me for. A walkman. with some cassettes... ...by Queen. And a Lio Ferri for you. That's nice. For the book of poetry... ...I've taken Lagarde and Michard one. A school book... ...being used for the shelf. It's the 19th. You Baudelaire, Mallarme... You'll be amused with that. I can't accept it. It is a personal book, right? You're not serious. It was thrown in a closet. My wife would not use it more. But she doesn't know... ...you gave it to me. - If, of course. We quickly learn... ...a lie, eh? I too am a lie. And lonely. You, you should talk Jacques has it all, has other... But me... Je n'ai que vous, Pierre. You were on vacation? - Yes, for 2 weeks. With my parents in the Vercors. Oh. - What is there? Holidays were introduced in France... ...by a communist government. You are trying to piss me off? - A little. *The little cat... The little cat... *Fled... Fled... *In the park! In the park! *In the park! In the park! What? *Will attack him! Will attack him! *Who left... Who left... *The door open? The door open? Well done! Let, let! Oh It?s our fault! No, but let me do it! - Peter! There's someone looking for you. - Continue. I'll have... ...a glass. - I'm coming! You asked Jacques to come here? There is something to clear up on a file. A file on what? You're doing it again? I apologize. I imagined a bunch of stuff. It's not serious. Go! Where is it? I would... To thank... again the CIA... ...in the person of Mr. Feeney, its director... ...for this valuable collaboration. If I may, Mr. President... ...I'll continue in French. Thanks to the last information from Farewell... ...We can see the global Soviet espionage system. KGB is not the only ones spying on us. Every business in the East... ...Science Academies, and even smaller... participants in... a trade show... ...are involved. And all these networks send routine information... ...that is centrally... ...reviewed by a body we didn't know... ...even existed: The VPK. - How many agents... ...Work in this agency? Who's in charge of it and since when? I don't have that reliable information at my disposal... ...that would allow me to answer you. A long time ago, wee too heard about the... VPK... for some time. It's like the Loch Ness monster! This is why you decided we should never talk. Good, continue... Mr. Director... We have calculated... ...that the Russians spend more... for industrial espionage than they do for their own research. They take the risk of looking... ...but they want to buy insurance... they will find something and it costs them dearly. The looting is over 40%... ...of their overall budget in the arms race. - Well... That's incredible. Are you sure? Sure. - 40%? Can you imagine... ...the sums at stake? It doesn't make any sense. To feed the enemy good information to hook them ...then dish out a lot of baloney... ...Is an old tactic. But you know... - Absolutely. But Farewell is the finest source of all time... ...Mr. President. I was given this to give to you. There's a second... ...If the other fails. - The Minox? Is it from the CIA? They're involved? - No, not really. but they know that the DST has a source in Moscow. They know your identity, as well as mine. - Why are they asking that? So far it has been going very well without them. Here are the detailed photos taken under any conditions. While photographing documents on the spot... ...and no more lugging them away! Someone from the CIA gave you these devices... ...So now they know who you are, who I am! But no! It was Jacques who discreetly passed them along in France. And I've stashed them in a little train for my son. Voila! Okay? I'll stop everything. It became too much for me. It's a big operation. It already had a code name: "Farewell". It was back on track until Mitterrand and Reagan I can't stand lying to my wife. I am doing it more, it disgusts me. Then we'll stop seeing each other. Now, I know what will happen. They will tell you You are arrogant, pretentious and pathetic... ...You, the people of West! It's me who decides how and to whom, I give... ...what I want! Tell those idiots at the DST they will change... ...Nothing! Nothing! Nobody buys me, never! Enough! You are busting my balls! Me too, I will decide! It's over for me! I will not throw away my life and my marriage... ...For reasons of state! Good luck and so long! Not so fast! Where are you off? What were you doing in this car? Your papers? - Kind of stupid! What a moron! That's not possible! Go! In the car! This is my cousin from Leningrad! It is dumb. You're angry, I know. But we will finish this story, Peter. Both of us. Soon, a large file will come into the hands of the service. The X list! Bingo! What's the story? This is the X list. This is the "Cream of Creams". The best agents at the Embassies and the Consulates. You provide the X list... It's killing the system. You know the favorite poem of your wife? I don't have the heart for poetry. "The Death of the Wolf. " By Alfred de Vigny. What's the poem about? A couple of wolves with 2 little ones,had been raised by the poet and his friends... The pups were slowing them... ...And the hunters approached quickly. So the male stopped... ...to wait for the hunter. and the mother fled with the pups. obviously, the hunters killed the male wolf... ...who died in silence. In silence. You scared? - Yeah, I'm afraid. I am afraid for my children, for my wife and for me. Even with diplomatic protection. Diplomatic Protection? To me, this will be the special treatment. And for you... ...It's a truck. An unfortunate accident. Watch the road. Drop me off at Smolenskaya station. It will be easier for you. You will follow me? Not worth it. I asked Jacques for your address... ...Your phone number, a photo of your wife and your son. Me too, I know a lot about you. When you finish this last case, agree to stay in the West. In time the dust will settle. Then you will come back a hero. In their eyes, I'll always be a traitor. I do the dirty work nobody wants to do. Until Thursday. Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Drop by. The two women can talk. Hello Igor! It's a Good day? Are you interested in what I am doing, now? A super day! We studied... the benefits of the FYP under Khrushchev... Solved... differential equations... ...discussed poverty in New York and there were some potatoes at lunch. Everything is great! Who's the lady with your mother? She came to see the puppies, after seeing the advertisement. Serge. Have you seen the book on dog breeds? Sergei! The book on dog breeds? I put it away the other night. Where? Look under the sofa. "Who's the woman with mother?" For Shame! Listen Igor... with couples there are times... Stop the bullshit... ...Agree? You are lying to me... ...You lie to mom you lie to everyone! It is your nature! A professional distortion! Leave us outside all your lies, okay? It is the cowards... ...who lie! And the traitors! Let me see! Have you gone completely mad? Sit down. Don't touch me Don't touch anything Don't worry, I will say nothing But you can give me some more lessons. Get out of my room. Get out of my room. Someone is coming. You're mad! You don't know.. I couldn't help it. I had to find out where you live... ...It is how it is, it?s how she talks to you ...it?s how you live... together! I couldn't resist it. Everything is going too fast. Let?s take just a little time... ...to let things clear up. Serge. please forgive me. I don't understand. Forgive me for the awful thing I've done. Serge. I want to be with you always... ...whatever happens. Hello. What is the problem? Hello, Comrade Captain! Yesterday, my wife and I got home at 4 in the morning. There was nobody here... ...to record our return in your notebook! Excuse me but I think it's serious. Bring the book. What about the documents while I'm away... ...While I'm here, talking to you! Yesterday, we were short staffed at the embassy level. Exactly. It won't happen again, I assure you. I trust you, Captain. Let?s forget it! Wait! Look! I bought the cognac for an office party. Drink to your health. Thank You. What are you doing? It said it was in your car. I've brought you what you wanted for Christmas. I did something stupid, Peter. I have a mistress. My son knows and Natasha does too. It's not very serious. It happens. There's ups and downs. My son hates me now. It is very important to him I'm taking risks here. Why didn't you tell him the truth? He never listen to me. More so now than ever! You have nothing for me? The X list? - Patience. That will be very soon. In the library... ...there is nothing interesting. In the room my wife left at the side of her bed... ...the plans for the French Alliance next month. Show it to your leaders. It will make a good impression. Agree? Be careful, it's fragile. We have to be careful our whole life... Careful The street is blocked we can't say why Ten years of memories destroyed It is what we want Without having to choose So sad It's is a lost cat believed to be found It's a dog more than world we know It's a street name Where will ever I'm on So very sad Oh! When the cop yells * And he doesn't know that you are sick and on the way home you casually Turn on the TV And look distracted A Zitrone hurry To speak of tierc? That you have not played Melancholy Melancholy It is seeing a beggar At the council room It is to see two lovers reading the newspaper It is to see her mom sick each time we meet *Melancholy This Garbo review In "Queen Christina" This Charlot review back in Chaplin times What's up? I saw you in the park today with a man. You are pathetic. Totally nuts. You have been lying to me... ...right from the beginning. And I can't take it. I'm leaving. I lost confidence. And I must protect our children from everything No, leave me. Four times I have delivered documents to the West. I photographed them. And I took the film to Paris, like any tourist. I never had a problem. The photos are being studied at the Elys?e. Then the White House. For the first time, it is possible things can really change. But I told Jacques it was over, that I was finished. It makes me sick that I have had to hide everything and lie to you. I have an ulcer since summer. I know, I should have explained it but I couldn't do it without risk. But I was a coward I preferred to lie to you. I completely screwed up. I will love you always. Let me be with you. I will ask Jacques for a post New York, that will be open in two months. And I will get it, believe me! I'll never have worry about keeping anything hidden from you. I promise you, never again! You don't even ask me what I think of New York. You're the one who wanted to go New York, from the start! Look at me. Look at me. Viens. What are you doing? Nothing Anatoly was... ...who I made my report to... ...on French Arms. You know... ...what he did with it? He released it to the meeting. Weren't you there? Go to the meeting... ...it?s getting late in the morning. We haven't seen one another, nor talked for a very long time, Serge. I... I have had a lot of work now. But let us do it Wednesday night. We need to talk. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? His father, during the war... ...commanded a division against the SS Mine was a simple cook, at the back. But I'm better than him. Right? The other day ...they were all excited in my office... ...And he asked me, "Alina, What is the meaning of "farewell"? " I explained it and he said: ..."I learned French so I could have a cushy job... ..."And they got mixed up with the English! " I will tell him the joke, Anatoly was brave. What are you gonna do? On Wednesday? - On Wednesday. Oph?lie! Oph?lie! It's over, Peter. The X list is... ...In your pocket. We won. When you return from Paris we'll drink champagne. I never listen to music much. watch out for the paranoid They listen to everyone, especially in Paris. Jacques, my wife is a nervous wreck in Moscow. She is cracking up because of all this. We gotta go. The position of New York will be open. It will be New York. I am not deciding alone. We will listen. The X list. Complete? Yes, complete. I'll convince Grigoriev he has to spend with his family in the West. I just need to know how it will happen. You are crazy! New York, you see, but to have it happen... ...it's a source in the West that Moscow happens to like. Yes, exactly! From the beginning, we only to play by our skin. So that's enough! You must assure me of my safety and that of Grigoriev. Yes? Paname Me me it is your eyes and your lips That I want to kiss right Where you find French songs? Leave me some secrets... Paname! I'm going... ...to Leningrad in two weeks. They are looking for an French interpreter. You will never leave your wife or your family. I understood I was going home. You're a little loose... ...Like all married men... ...Sergei... Hold me in your arms... ...And then take me back to my house. Alright dude... this time right between the eyes. Not bad, huh? It makes you want to see the whole picture. I didn't have time to organise a screening for you but I wanted to at least show you how in the film the point of view changes. It's a masterpiece. You know, Feeney came by to see me this morning. One of their moles in the KGB identified Farewell.. What? Don't worry. Only two people in the CIA who know about this. Are the French aware? Well... Feeney doesn't think we should tell them, and I agree. We know enough to act without them. What will you and Feeney do? Wipe out their X List then play poker! It's more fun to bluff... ...When we know that the adversary has a pathetic hand! You are absolutely right, Mr. President. It's a new game. We'll have to strike hard. GLASGOW, UK WASHINGTON, USA MUNICH, WEST GERMANY Ten, nine, eight... ...seven, six, five... ...four... My fellow Americans, thank you for sharing this moment with me tonight. The subject matter I want to discuss with you, security... and peace, is both fundamental and crusial today. We and our allies... have managed to contain nuclear warfare for more than 30 years This stable aproach, by means of an offensive threat worked well. After consultation my advisors... I think it is up to us to come up with a programm to counter the impressive Soviet nuclear missile threat by defensive measures placed in Earth orbit There are risks and the results will take time. But I think we can do it When this step... I ask for your prayers and to support me. Thank you, good night, and God bless you! Amen! What do you know?, the KGB?, these "defensive measures?... "placed in Earth orbit? There have been leaks in the American press. They nicknamed this project... ..."Star Wars". - Tell me. Unfortunately we know nothing more. We have lost almost all our sources of information. But it is only temporary! I ordered an extensive investigation... ...Which is moving very quickly. To establish our own "Star Wars"... How long will it take? 10 years. Minimum! Thank you, ...Comrades. Andropov asked to go to Geneva. He is not ready. I will see Reagan. I will try to convince to renounce... ...this project, but... he will go after... ...especially today. Because it has been well known... ...we have no way we can monitor them. The country is in a critical situation... ...particularly dangerous, Comrade General The country must take a deep breath... ...find new energy, otherwise it will sink... ...Into chaos. For the country, more than ever... ...needs reforms. Urgent reforms! The door is closing. What are you doing? How? - Get out of here! You want a coffee? Not after noon. It has been dark for a while. You told Natasha I am in Moscow? How is she? In the last letter... ... she wrote it's very hard for her. I am so stupid! You know all that! You've been reading? I think... ...we will find... ...she and I... they are clever, these Americans! Take on an identity as lovers... ...of French culture. Tell me... ...who was your contact in the American Embassy... ...and what did you give him Specifically... ...you can save yourself. Tell me. "But the children of the wolf... ..."played in silence... "... Not knowing that on two... ..."only half asleep... The door opens. "Behind the walls... "their enemy. " "But the children of the wolf played in silence... " Coming back to the point. You're here because your friends betrayed you, Grigoriev. You're all alone! Think abou my suggestion... "He looks at us again Then he lies down again... ..."While licking the blood spread on his lips. " Goodbye! What did you do? Nothing. They think I am someone who is... ... working for the Americans... They will find out they are wrong. Do not worry. Igor didn't come? He is in school. He'll spend the morning Don't cry... ...my dear. And straighten up! If you tell them everything, they will let you go home. Is that what he said? Forgive me, please. Please, forgive me. You too You really want I come home? Yes! Madame... - Hey! I beg you. I am a friend of your husband. I'm French. Where is he? He is suffering? My husband has nothing to do with you. The dismal KGB traps! Shame This is not a trap. I can help you. Let us be! I am a French residence. - Leave us be! Madame! Have you searched the parents room? - Not yet, I'm going. You looked everywhere? Go check the sons room. Okay. Come here, please. Putain! Is it an obsession with you? What? Never I must find out. Tell me why my father... ...Finds himself in prison because of the KGB, why these guys... ...dig into our affairs. What the hell is going on? When was he arrested? Why? How is he? Answer me. Putain! Answer my question! Igor... You know nothing about your father. I want to show you something. The owner of the book knows... ...That you can not give it back soon. Mlle Jessica Zimmermann. An uneventful file. Today Ms. Wheat was married... ...to Pierre Froment... ...two children, move into the French Residence What... ...This story in poetry... ...in your handwriting... In Russian and French? What's this? - I took this book these people had... ...during a literary evening put on by the French Institute. I liked this poem: "The death of the wolf". I had an idea that, with these verses, I could create... ...a code. A brilliant new code. Are you kidding us! Want to save time, right? I have lots of time. You'll tell me everything! "The Covenant Cities... ...is the name I gave to my syntax. "Never enter into a pact in the cities... ..."as man did... ..."in bonding with domestic animals. " At 8:15 this morning he left on foot, alone. His wife needed the car, so he took the subway... ...and promised to return by 19h. You followed? All reports are formal, there is nothing in the French. And his wife? Around 9 am, she left with children in the car. She was buying clothes for the children. Did you notice anyone following you? - No. We got rid of the Lada because of no staff. Then OK! The airport is your last chance. You will see if the French are leaving! They had called. The device is in place. They won't fly it. He has promised back at 19h. I am the skin... ...If they spin. "I'm skin... " Everything will be alright. Don't worry. Where you going? Come back! Stay the in same lines. don't move! Never anything at the airport. They are stashed somewhere. They are playing hide and seek. By the road! - What? They are heading to the Finnish border! 800 km to the north? Would you leave in mid-winter with two children in the back? I don't have any children. Your papers. Good evening. What is your destination and the purpose of your trip? Alexei! Don't move! Alexei! Your license is not signed. It's true! I will do it. What happened? Someone has been trying to cross the border. Go ahead. - Thank you, goodbye. Stop! Stop! Thank you Go ahead. The cubs have fled. Saved. Igor and Natasha knew nothing. Absolutely nothing! Anyway... ...Natasha had never accepted it. She hates lying. You know very well. Let's stick to facts. I do not want to die like the others... ...shot in the neck. It is not for you to decide. Of course it does. Nothing... ...As never before, for a long night comes. Without sacrifice change is not possible. The country needs change to survive. The country will change thanks to you, Serge. Apart from your statue at the Kremlin do you want anything else? Thank you for coming, Igor. I think... ...All these times when I wanted to chat with you... ...But you, you locked yourself in your room. And now... - Stop Daddy What will happen, now? Everything will change. The world will change. It will not be easy... ...but you are young, intelligent. You'll find your place. Dad... for you. What will happen to you? We will make arrangements with Gorbachev... ...and others. We found... ...a common ground. Are you sure? Yes. Separate them! Get him out of here soon! Papa! My son! NATO BASE, WEST GERMANY Please. The men and women of the free world owe you a lot, Mr. Froment. They don't know it and they... mustn't find out. Because if they did, they'd know that all or almost all of the western strategic points had no secrets from the Russians and hadn't for a long time. They will lose trust in their institutions. And no democracy can function without the trust of its people, Mr. Froment. No one. Exchange Grigoriev and his family. That's all I came to ask you for. He won't say a word about all of these. I know him well. And we owe him a lot, don't we? Such an operation has no chance of seeing the light of day. In fact you don't give a damm about people. You spent a lot of crop about Western democracies... but you're letting a man go to his death, because it suits you. I understand. If Grigoriev talk on this side of the wall you will be thrown out. But you see, Grigoriev didn't try to save his head like you do. No. He has a little bit more class than you. Come over here. Come here. That man is called Shukhov. A senior officer in the KGB. We then transferred the entries taken from this NATO database. He has been working for us since '78. We approached him when he was stationed in Ottawa. He was disappointed with the Soviet system, Brezhnev and his cronies. The perfect profile. Like Grigoriev... ...But with a Swiss bank account. He taught us nothing that was very interesting... ...But last Christmas, everything changed. On December 24, He tried to resume his affair... ...With Grigoriev's wife at his place of work. It failed. He was dejected... ...he left the military museum and saw Grigoriev in the park. with you, M. Froment. From that moment on, we knew... ...What Farewell was. how he operated, disregarding... ...elementary rules of espionage. It was so reckless... ...it was above suspicion. We asked Shukhov to arrange for the Russians to find out who, Farewell was. The KGB had started... ...an internal investigation that seriously threatened all our sources... ...of information. So, yes... we gave them Grigoriev. It was like throwing a dog a bone. Bye, bye Farewell. In that way, we saved our whole network. And we didn't forget about you either, Mr. Froment. The DST had no one the spot, asked us to get you out. And on March 4, your cleaning lady gave you a signal, at the request of Lt. Colonel Shukhov. And you managed to escape. Without having serious problems. You should bringing try to forget this business. It's better for you, your marriage and your ulcer. And New York... is waiting for you with open arms. East 72nd Street... ...A few steps from Central Park and a French school. You'll see... over there life is sweet... for well affluent young couples, without problems. subtitles: DML. Edit: motherJim
