Are you OK, Chelsea? That was really scary. Shut up, shut up, shut up. I'm already on edge, man. I'm already on edge. OK. Trail To Terror. Let's do it. Let's do the trail. Trail To Terror, it is a documentary, but it also is a challenge, it's a total experiment. It's five nights in a row, spending the night at five of the scariest places in America. The nights end with us going to bed. We draw out of a hat what room you go sleep in and you go to bed. So, we're gonna be at huge scary places sleeping in separate rooms super far apart. I've always liked fear. I love the idea of fear. Fear is cool. So I've always been intrigued by that and I think if you're gonna capture real fear on camera, this is the way to do it. It's five nights in a row of this. We're gonna be battling sleep deprivation. We're gonna be battling the cold. We're gonna be battling scary abandoned places in the dark. It's... We're screwed. I don't know how many times I have to say that we're screwed, but we're screwed. We're screwed! This is so awesome! You need some little exercises here. This is our last fun day. I'm a professional hockey player. I think that I will, obviously, have more stamina. Um... No, I don't, though. I... Redo! Hold on. OK, ready? # Ooh ooh-ooh ooh # Ahh! Ha ha ha # Rough! Check. Take. Cut. My name is Tanner Wiseman. I'm 6'4". I'm 225lb and I am gonna cry like a girl. Hello. Hello, going shopping! Let me get this. Sausage and pepperoni in a golden crust. Uh, yeah. Oh. That's gonna be Chelsea in two days! Dakota is my brother. I definitely trust my brother, but I also think that he picked some pretty scary places, because he doesn't go half-assed on stuff. He's knows where our limits are and he knows how far he can push us. And he knows he can go past it, because, like, what am I gonna do? Disown him as his sister? I can't do that. Exactly. That's why he wanted me. This sucks! This makes sense now. Oh... Coalin! Come on, man! That's a good horn. Welcome! Oh! So, Dakota hasn't told me really anything about what we're doing. I kind of like it that way, because it doesn't give me time to think about, like, oh, "I'm about to go to this really terrible place." I know nothing about these locations. I just know that we're driving east. I'm pretty happy about the idea that we don't know what's going on. Yeah, I'm not complaining. I think that we are underestimating how bad it's gonna be. I like to think I'm tough, but this might change... my perspective. I'm not tough. I'm not tough. Our last meal at home. This is gonna be the last time we're actually happy in our lives. And not clinically depressed. Oh, my gosh. What? You think I'm joking? I don't know how to even get pumped for something like this. That scared me a little bit. Well... Well? This is happening. This is real. I am not prepared mentally for this at all. I've started reading the Bible a lot more! I'm not even kidding you. # Curiosity takes us to haunted places # Where things go bump in the night # Inquiring minds seek to find # A connection to an afterlife # There's a fascination in the exploration # And we have our stories to tell # You won't believe the things we've seen # Out on the paranormal trail # You won't believe the things we've seen # Out on the paranormal trail # Boo! Ohh! You got a nice bed. Oh, this is not bad. No, it's not that bad. Nope, we're on a schedule, shit right here. Ahhh! You scared us, Chels. So predictable. So, scary I definitely believe in spirits. I definitely believe in demons and angels. I don't know, I just hope there's no, like, satanic rituals that have been at this place, that's gonna be the goofed-up part. There's negative energies in the world, so I think that demons exist. I think a lot of times, what a lot of people think are ghosts are demons just playing with people. Good morning. Good morning, beautiful. Today's your last day. That was the last night I'm gonna sleep comfortable. Your last night. So this is how we're taking showers, I guess. Hey, Coalin? Yeah. No jerking off in there! Ah. OK, I thought I'd catch you. Maybe next time. I'm too tired. Maybe next time. OK. Next time. I know you'll do it. So, we are at a hotel, about eight miles from the first location. I'm gonna get excited once I'm at location. Yeah. So, for me, it's like, I don't know what it is. Yeah. You don't know? No, he hasn't told me. You don't know either? No, I have no idea. What? Yeah. We're gonna leave you guys alone in your hotel and we're gonna go to the location. Let me just leave you with a little note. There you go. Thanks for the encouragement. See you guys. Seriously, we'll be back at night. All right, you guys have fun. So, Dakota, we're almost there. Yes, we are about to... about to get to the first location. All right, we're turning in. This is the turn. Are you ready, Dakota? Oh, man, this is nuts. They are in for a treat. We're gonna go step in the RV and tell them where they're going for the night. I'm not ready for this. So, Tanner, you're gonna open. So, here goes night number one. Boom, boom, boom! Ashmore Estates. What is that? I don't know what that is. That's what it looks like. From 1870 to 1959, the building operated as the Coles County Poor Farm. The residents of the poor farm were referred to as "inmates". Over 100 of them died on the property. The poor farm actually was started by the state and what it would have would be indigent people or people that were divorced or had a disability or a learning disability. Basically, the poor farms were built outside of town for the simple reason that they didn't want the residents of the poor farm to actually intermingle with the townspeople. The conditions of the poor farm, basically, it was a working environment, almost like they were in jail, the people that here were actually called inmates. The conditions of the poor farm were noted by the Board of Commissioners of public charities to have vermin-infected walls. The Board of Commissioners also noted that flies swarmed everywhere. That's really sad. In 1959, the building was renovated and turned into a psychiatric hospital. You have to remember this was the '50s and '60s in mental health and they were trying a lot of strange stuff. Lobotomies and electric shocks. And, uh, being out here in the boonies, who knows what went on? The building has sat abandoned since then, and is now known to be extremely haunted, due to its death-filled history. We had worked out here, on a Saturday, Sunday and my son was out here helping me. His girlfriend was sitting in her car out front and her daughter wanted to know why she couldn't go in the building. She said, "They won't let little kids go in the building." She pointed up to the window and said, "How come she can?" She saw a little girl standing in the window. Be consciously aware that you, if something should happen and you can't explain it, that you need to leave. 00:19:53.160 -- 00:19:55.440 Well, here goes nothing. Well, here goes nothing. Yeah. No turning back now. Right. I was feeling pretty confident. Um... Now it's gonna be, I feel like this is gonna be really interesting. All right, we're here. There it is. Yeah. All right. See how heavy those doors are? Oh, man. It's so quiet. Do you want to go down to the second floor? Yeah. Yeah. Whoo-oo! Now, this is gonna be freaky! Infrared. Dude, this is so weird, I can't see anything. Go to infrared. Oh, my gosh, you can see that well. Off. On. Infrared on. Infrared light we can't see with our eyes. I want a camera. Off...on. Off...on. How are you feeling, everybody? Give me that camera. You gonna go by yourself? Did you just hear that? I did, I totally heard that. 00:21:58.120 -- 00:22:02.880 That was like a high-pitched thing. It was like a woman. Like... Did you just hear that? Coalin, are you going? I'm going. All right. How did everybody sleep? I slept good. I didn't sleep. I didn't fall asleep. You didn't sleep at all? No. Dakota cried like a little baby. "Chelsea!" I was just freaking out. I heard a lady screaming. "Chelsea, was that you?" So do you think Dakota is kind of a little girl? I don't know. Let's let the viewers decide! Honestly... if tonight is the last night of like... Oh, man. Yeah? I literally just heard buzzing. Buzzing? maybe we can get through it. Night three is when it really gets real. Like... Like legit buzzing above my head. That's not tonight, so we got one more night. I didn't see anything around your head. I don't know what you'd call last night, but that was pretty real. And it didn't go away. Like a bug? Like, that's what I'm saying, I didn't see a bug or anything around your head. I know. I'm just basing my ranking off of what it looks like. Stay there. I've got drugs! I've got drugs! He's got allergy drugs. We're not doing real drugs. We're recording. All right. Well, have a fun time. See you! Bye, bitches. Hi! We are gonna be a mess by night four. Seriously, I think we're gonna be screwed by night four. What? What? So, this is the haunted pool. This is the haunted pool! Guys, I'm hearing people talking. Dude, I am, too. I thought I saw something. Oh, I'm gonna be relaxing my ass off! I am really hearing people talking right now. I thought I saw... Something's moving! Where? Something's fucking moving. Oh, my God. What, what, what was it? Definitely, a fucking... Oh, what the frick, man? What? What? Let me see. I want to play that back and show you a full fucking person walking. Are you serious? I kid you not, man, I heard, like, whispers. Ready to do the thing? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna change quick. Hold on, no-one move. No-one move. No-one move. It's too late, the door's locked! All right, Coalin, I want you to walk back. How is it? Dude, this one is so big. Dakota, I want you to walk forward. Walk forward? Just, just move around. It's like eight times as big. Good. So, OK. This is awesome. Oh, wow, it's nice and really quiet out here. Can I play this back and just show you what the fuck I saw? There's no noise. This is actually super-cool looking. I'm telling you, dude - Genuine? Let's see what you have to say at the end of the night. What do you think you saw in the camera? Straight up, a straight up person. Wow, this is awesome! A straight up person just walking in the bottom corner of the window. Oh, my gosh! I feel like I'm in an old scary movie. Are you sure? Straight up. Are you sure it wasn't a car? Seriously. So, you guys want to sit down and read about this place? That's insane. All right. Night two. Oh, God. Night two. We already know what it looks like since we're here. Night number two. The Randolph County Infirmary. This 1850s, poor-farm infirmary was built on the site where the original county asylum burned down many years prior. Like, this whole time I've been in there, I've been trying to be like, "OK, maybe it's the wind." They built a facility just for the mentally insane. Look how old this, like, reconstruction of some of these windows are, It had terrible conditions. There were people being put in cages. maybe there's a draught, but like for that, like, shadow... They were sleeping outside. The weirdest part is no-one is moving and the shadow is moving. The county asylum burned down in 1897. More people perished. We're at the back end of the hall. Tanner was ahead of us. And you two were sitting down. They buried them out in the very back, where that pasture is, with the cows. As soon as you said something, I didn't move. I was just trying to listen. That's where at least 30 plus bodies are buried, back there. OK. So, look at this. So, watch this. Some light... Three years would go by, they would start building the Randolph County Infirmary. Oh. So, watch, this light turns on. From 1899, all the way up until about 2008, it was operational. Then, once the thing passes it, it's gone. Look at that! Oh, my gosh. Look at that. We know in its first 40 years, it was the most corrupt. Holy crap. It zooms away. And then, and then, and then the light's gone. Patients fighting each other. Patients killing each other. You fucking maniac. How did you see that? Because I...am...the...man! Just one month ago, the abandoned facility was opened to the public. I don't want to go back in there. Damn, that was nuts. Play it again, The weirdest part is actually the end when it zooms away. There have already been claims of seeing "black shadow people", humanoid apparitions, - It doesn't just like walk away. - Zoom! hearing unexplainable voices and clothes being tugged. I'm always sceptical going into a place. Maybe it's not as haunted as everyone's saying. But between the footsteps and the noises and the doors slamming, OK, so we're about to go to bed. We all picked the four scariest locations. So we're gonna draw. there's no way it was anyone else, so I know this place is haunted. Wherever you pull is where you have to go sleep for the night. Who wants to go first? How about the camera guy? Camera guy! I was talking on the phone and I was down here in the basement. Oh no, oh no, oh no. As I was talking, I heard somebody walk up. I heard three steps. Got the third... The camera guy got... Then the last step... Why? ..a kind of shuffle and they stopped. What did you get? What did you get? The third floor hallway. I looked back around and I see somebody. I got the scariest one! Oh, he couldn't have been 100lb. I'm gonna get the boiler room. He had what looked like two towels wrapped around his head. I really don't want the boiler room. And he just stood... Second... Boiler room! No! like I was first in line and he was second. I got the second worst room, the boiler room. That was... That caught my attention. Now I'm kind of a little bit more on my tiptoes when I walk around. At the same time? Ready? Don't look at it! No! At the same time. When I was downstairs, in the second-floor men's ward, I'm gonna have to do the other one. We got to pick one. I heard a door handle shake and a door slam. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Now, it sounds to a normal person, oh, that's really not scary, Ready? Go. Second floor. Wheelchair. First floor. Chelsea got the good one. but when you can't explain what caused that and it's right close... You know what I mean? She got the best one. I got the wheelchair room. That's, to me, fear and, in five years, I never had something come that close. Dakota says, "It'll be fun", he says. "We'll have a lot of good times", he says. I couldn't explain it, there was nothing there. It was real. It was in my face. I don't think I believe anything that he has to say. All right. I feel that you are going to find a mix of good and evil here. So, I'm about to go to bed. Um... Yeah, I drew this card, it's great. I'm not really... looking forward to the... separated night sleeping. Ohh... Yeah, it's gonna suck. This place is so much bigger. I want to do a walk through. I'm currently getting ready to go to bed. Let's go walk through. All right. I kind of lucked out with my first sleeping location, but it's still pretty scary. Hopefully I don't have to turn this back on, because that means something scary happened. Good night. Would you like to go to the bathroom? No, I'd rather poo my pants. Well, I picked the... Oh, look at that! ..third scariest room. I don't know what that is, but I don't like it. I got my friend... in a wheelchair. Whoa, look at this. Dude, I don't like whatever that... There's no way in shit I'm falling asleep. I saw this in the last location. There's so much, like, stuff. Yeah, I got... I drew this floor, so... It's so weird... I, kind of, am not a big fan of Dakota right now. Ohh! Whoa! You know? I just turned off my lights. What? What? Whoa. Now I'm in, like, the pitch black. One of these big old things just... I really, really, really, really, really am not a big fan of Dakota right now. It's so weird... Ohh! Whoa! Oh, it scared the crap... That was freaky. All right, go to bed. Huuh. Wow. Oh, what? I don't like whoever was here before us. Yeah, dude, I don't like that, at all. What the hell is that about? Oh, that's creepy! Whoa! What? Yeah. Oh, yeah, this is the cell. Why is there a cell? There's only one cell in the whole building. It's here. How can you not go insane like this? There's one cell in the whole building, in the whole facility. That's so weird. Really creepy. Scary as hell. All right. Let's break into teams of two. Teams of two. Let's go upstairs. Dak, I'm with you. Right, come on, let's do it. What was that? What was that? Oh, this is terrible. Into the basement we go. What was that? What was that? It's so cold in here. Whoa! What? Chelsea! I just heard more footsteps again. Chelsea, that was not cool. Like someone is right outside. That was not me. It's so cold in here. Whoa! What was that? Dude, stop. What the fuck? OK. What the fuck? Chelsea? Hello? I wonder if they found anything upstairs. Chelsea? Yeah? Did you just hear that? No. Whoa! Oh, my God. Holy shit, that wasn't you? No. Oh, my God. What? I always leave my camera... Where are you guys? What's wrong? Did you guys hear that door slam? No. Oh, my gosh. I went in Chelsea's room, because I heard a girl. Something slammed. She's like, no, I didn't hear anything, I wasn't talking. Well, something slammed... Whoa, this door is closed. What door? And my camera wasn't even freaking recording. Dude, are you sure? I am so sure. I don't know. Oh, fuck that, guys, it's the jail cell. I'm so mad my camera wasn't on. I swear I hit record though to start. Oh, no. Fuck. Well, maybe Chelsea's camera caught it, if it was that close. That wasn't closed, guys. That wasn't closed at all. How did you not hear it with your ears? I can't even believe that. No way! This was closed, this door. It was closed when you came over here? Yeah. Are you sure? Dude, I'd just opened it. What the fuck? Whoa! I was thinking about a little girl the whole time. I don't know why a little girl. Me, too. I just heard footsteps on the floor above us. The attic? A little girl. That is so freaky. You guys didn't even see the interviews we got earlier. There it is again. That's a person or... I heard someone. Guys... She pointed up to the window and said, "How come she can?" She saw a little girl standing in the window. I just... Like, let's just pack up, let's go. The sun is literally about to come up, so... Let's just go. Let's go. Whoa! Whoa! What was that? What the fuck was that? You fucker. That was you. It's, uh, 7am. I was playing with this. Quite exhausted. Running on fumes. Now we're off on the road to Indiana. I didn't think I'd make you scared, I was like... Chelsea, you up and moving? Kind of. We should probably start thinking about going to bed soon. Or should we go in the basement? There we go. I'm really not sure. I think we should start going to bed soon. Dak Attack? Hi. I am a zombie and it's only day one. I think so, too. It's only day one. We're gonna be like freaking like dead. 00:31:54.520 -- 00:31:56.920 Right, here I am in this... Right, here I am in this... ..jail cell, here on the third floor, by myself. This is definitely, um, a step up from last night. I am in a cage here, people. All right, guys, so... I got the first floor hallway. Kind of freaked out a little bit. Well... I'm in the basement. It's time to go to bed. Somehow. I'm about to go to bed. I'm on the basement floor. Second hallway. This sucks so bad. Good night. Good night, dude. This sucks ass. Whoa. Dakota, are you moving? What the hell is that? Are you moving? No. Dakota, are you moving? What the hell is that? Are you moving? No. I'm going back to bed. What? I'm gonna go back to bed. Fucking how? I'm gonna try. Are you legitimately trying to fall asleep? Yeah. No. I can't. I don't get how, dude. I am sitting up. Eyes wide open right now. Did you move? No. Shut up. Are you serious? No. Something is moving behind my camera. All right, what the fuck was that? What was that? What the fuck was that? What the... OK. What was that? What was that? Something just crashed. Oh, I have such a headache. I have such a headache. I definitely had the hardest room this time around and I hope that it's like a one-time deal. That was scary. I'm ready to get out of here. See you later. This is some great coffee. Yeah. Coffee. OK, ow! Actually, hot. Sorry. Redo. Cut? The location is right up there in those trees. We're deep up there on the hill in those trees. That's so freaky. This is way bigger than yesterday. It's, it's more of a solid object. I have watched it once crawl out of one of the rooms on the left. It crawled towards us on the ceiling. It came down the wall. It kind of turned into that and came right up in front of us. Then faded out and gone. Guys, already... I just know it's gonna be really bad. Oh, man, Tanner and Chelsea are gonna freaking die. Night number three. Night number three. I don't know where I'm going. RIP Chelsea Laden. RIP my pants. I have a really weird feeling about this one. I am freaking out. I don't know why, I didn't even have caffeine today. Yeah, me, neither. Big strides in my life, I can face anything now, I'm not even kidding. My fear standards are much higher. We're here. Man, this is huge. Where are we? What is this place? We're up on a hill actually right now in the woods. Hill View Manor. A house? A mansion? On a hill? Guys, here we are. A strip club? Night number three. Hill View Manor. Oh, nice. I still don't know where we are, so let's continue. Oh, fuck. This is not a good place. This is a really bad place. Everyone keeps saying that, but I still don't know what the heck - This is bad. Opened on October 19, 1926, and originally known as the Lawrence County Home For The Aged, it's purpose was to serve as a poor house for the county's orphans, mentally ill and elderly residents with no traceable family. That's sad. It was a place where you didn't want to be sent. A lot of mysterious kind of... cover-upy kind of stuff. We found quite a few deaths of people that would come in and then, three or four days later, they would have committed suicide by a fractured skull. I don't know how they were committing suicide by fracturing their own skull. In the late 1960s, a new wing was added to the building and the facility was renamed Hill View Manor. It was an extended care facility. It basically became an old age home. These walls have witnessed thousands of deaths. The entire time this place was in operation, we've estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 people died in the building. A large handful of inmates are known to have committed suicide. We've had people that hung themselves from trees outside. We've had people jump out of windows, off the roof. Although it seems to sit quietly at the top of this grassy hill above Route 65, evidence of its history remains active. Witnesses report seeing shadow figures approaching them and hearing many unknown voices. Whatever this is, it's dark. I don't mean to scare you guys, but it's been something creepy. I was with a group, it was almost time to lock up for the night. We were all staring at the end of the hallway watching what looked like a skeletal type creature poke its hand out from under the handrail at the end of the hallway and eerily just... kind of do a little movement with its fingers, like it was waving, and it did this little grimacing, kind of twisting motion with its head to look at us. The best way that I can describe it is it looked like the shadow of a skeleton. I had witnessed something very, very frightening. We call it The Creeper. People have described it as having two legs, four legs and six legs. It crawls on the ceiling, crawls on the walls, crawls on the floor. We watched this thing crawl out of one of the rooms on the left. It crawled towards us on the ceiling. It came down the wall. It hit the floor. It started to crawl towards us and then turned into a black mist. I do think this place is haunted. I didn't when I first came here, but you come here, you have something run at you, you get a few doors slammed in your face, it kind of changes your mind. I'm really kind of anxious to see how you guys do tonight. Just good luck. I mean... And God bless, because I wouldn't do it. You guys go off on your own through the night? No. No, you would not catch me in a room by myself. That's scary, just knowing how many people died here is like frightening. Like, I knew I've heard of Hill View Manor. Once I saw these, the inside of these rooms and some of these pictures, now I know exactly what's going on. What's gonna happen tonight is not gonna be good. All right, let's go. 00:41:37.600 -- 00:41:39.600 Oh, what? No, thank you. Oh, what? No, thank you. Freaky. I didn't see this today, did you? No. I did not see this room today. I, like, literally feel sick to my stomach. Really? Yeah. Anyone else? Not any more. It comes and goes. I felt it right away, like I was going to puke. How are you feeling, Tanner? Something about this place is just so much different from the other nights. I heard that. What was that? Sssh! Right there. Dude, are we... I've never been in here. Oh, no. I was gonna help you. Yeah, we definitely... What the heck? Where are we? Whoa. Wait. This goes back to the cafeteria. So, we came up through here and... So we just didn't cover this little mini hall. OK. What was that? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? OK, relax, relax, relax. That was not a camera? No! What was beeping? What was beeping? Are we allowed in this hallway, you guys? Yes, we are. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, I'm actually really scared. Wait, I'm still confused. Guys, where did that even come from? It sounds like a legitimate, like, ER thing. That sounded like an ER...? Oh, my gosh, Chelsea. Guys. Holy crap, that sounded like a heartbeat! What the shyster? That was definitely a freaking heart monitor. I don't know what that was. Oh, my gosh. OK. What was that? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I call not ever sleeping up here. That was a freaking heart monitor. It sounds like that. Like, exactly like that. 100% like that. At least it wasn't... Let's just be quiet. You guys, turn off the lights. OK, go dark. Go dark, go dark. Oh, fuck going dark. What? Someone's talking upstairs. The third floor. The third freaking floor. I don't know about this wing. Shut up! Shut up, shut up. Sssh! But... Sssh! Oh, my God. Are you OK? That was a little girl, that was a little freaking girl. Sssh! Quiet. That was the scariest thing I've ever seen. Quiet. You're OK. What the heck was that? I don't know about this wing. I don't know about this wing. Are you OK? I've like never heard a voice before like that in my life. Are you OK, Chelsea? That was really scary. We need to take a break. Let's just go... Yeah, let's go. Let's go downstairs. You need to take a break. This is really scary. Chelsea gets to be in the middle. Let her in the middle. All right. We need to protect her. That was literally the scariest thing. Hey, hey, a deep breath real quick. OK? We need to just go downstairs. A deep breath. Let's go. That was a legitimate voice. That was a voice, that was a - Let's go back... Hey, guys, guys. Let's just go. I need everyone just to relax. OK? Down the stairs. Just follow me, I know where I'm going. I'm freaking... We're done. I'm so freaking scared. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I just got really scared. I know 100% that was a voice. That's like all I know guaranteed. That was a legitimate, like, voice. It was a girl. And it was in the hallway, we always hear things upstairs or downstairs. This was... That makes no sense, we're the only ones here. All four of us heard the same exact thing at the same time. I mean, we checked every... We... covered this...that floor pretty well, so if there was like... The people out there watching this are gonna go, "There could have been someone in the building." There wasn't. We... We covered that whole floor. I think that there could be something very dark here, possibly demonic. It takes the form of many different things. We all four are people of faith, so it can't possess us. I'm seriously like so... I'm not... I'm not sleeping alone. I'm gonna either quit today or I'm not sleeping alone. You guys can decide. I'm doing doubles. I'll do doubles. Do you guys want me here? I'm not sleeping alone tonight. Everything that we're doing right now is kind of testing everything in our faith. We just ask, ask you for a prayer of protection, of calmness and peace of mind. Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Let's go. All right. Those are the two spots. The teams are, right now, it's gonna be Dakota and Chelsea in one spot and Coalin and I in another. Fuck. Really? Let me see yours. No, dang it. Third floor hallway. This is not my night. Second floor hallway. I have the worst touch for drawing. All right, so, uh, this is us up in the third floor. Going to bed. It's been a long night. Yeah. All right, dude, good night. Good night. So...me and Chelsea, we're on the second floor hallway, where all hell broke loose earlier. This is the room right there, that we were in when everything happened. If we can get through this, it's gonna be amazing that we did it. OK, good night. Sleep good. What? What? Oh, my God. That was loud. That was really loud. Oh, my gosh. OK, this is getting freaky again. Oh, my God. I know, this building sucks. Hill View Manor is a bitch. I shouldn't have said that. No. I take that back. Chelsea? It's time to get up. What? I'm just like, I can't believe we did that. So... we faced our fears. I don't know why this is still on. That was the scariest night of my life, by far. Yeah. All right, let's go get Tanner and Coalin. All right, so we're about to watch over the footage from yesterday, when we heard the little girl's voice. We just need to kind of rewatch this and see what the hell happened. Someone's talking upstairs. The third floor. The third freaking floor. "I don't know about this wing." "Holy shit! "Shut up! Shut up, shut up. Stop, stop. Shut up." "I don't know about this wing." Whoa! That's so freaky. Whoa! What? What? What, what? Oh, my goodness! That's so freaky. Holy shit. Have fun at the hotel. He says it's worse than last night. I don't know what can be really worse than last night. Exactly. See you guys. Bye. Bye. Hey, Dakota, what are you doing? We have to go the location right now and it's raining out. We need to get outside shots. Can't use the drone. It's gonna be great! Dude, you've got to be really screwed. I know. Like, I don't have enough energy to give to this any more. Hoorah. Night number four. Trail To Terror. Tonight is gonna be the night that the sleep deprivation and all that stuff is really hitting hard. If there was a World's Best Sister award, I would get it. If there was a World's Worst Brother, I think I'd get it! What the fuck is this? I don't get it. Oh, wait, isn't it over here? It's this whole thing. OK. Night number four. Oh. St Albans Sanatorium. Described by many professional paranormal investigators as "the most active location on the east coast", this sanatorium is not for the weak. Great In the 1700s, members of the Shawnee and the Cherokee Indian tribes inhabited this land. There was much massacre and bloodshed between these tribes and the early pioneers. It was during the Civil War in 1865, that the Union forces defeated the Confederate forces in the violent Battle of New Bern and Cloyd's Mountain. The battle was very bloody. The North had this side of the river. There are Civil War soldiers seen here on the property. In 1892, the facility was built as the St Albans Boys' School. In 1916, Dr JC King converted the school into a hospital for the mentally ill calling it "St Albans Sanatorium". St Albans Sanatorium became one of the leading sanatoriums in the nation. Many patients passed away, as a result of the experimental treatments performed at the institution. The insulin coma caused a great many fatalities, as well as the electroshock therapy. There are also several documented suicides, four to have taken place in the same bathroom. That's really creepy. For decades, paranormal investigators have investigated and have reported full-bodied apparitions, shadow figures and demonic beings in harmful attacks. I think there's evil things here, yes. I've seen people get scratched. I've seen people get pushed. I've seen people knocked down the stairs. So I lifted his shirt up and it just looked like somebody took a whip and whipped his back. The stripes, some were as high as a half inch. The scariest thing that happened to me in St Albans was down in the bowling alley. Clear as day, I heard something brush on the floor and a hiss. I think that's the most active place at St Albans. PS, watch out for red eyes and the Goat Man. I looked up to the second floor of the stairs. There was two little red eyes sitting there. Next thing you know, I seen it step down on the stairs. It started stepping down, coming towards me. As you guys and gals come in here tonight, I hope you don't run up on the Goat Man. He has the legs of a man, but when you get to his head, it's definitely the head of a goat. And, if you give him reason, he'll hurt you. Dude, that's the devil. It's really bad. It's crazy. This is so narrow. It's like the Scooby Doo doors! Yeah. I got the worst flashlight, this is not bright. This is creepy, guys. Oh, my God, that's the bathroom. Seriously? That's the suicide bathroom, yeah. That's the bathroom four people committed suicide in. That's so sad. It is sad. This is the electroshock therapy room. This is like where all the experimentation went on. This is like the freaky-ass room. A bowling alley. Oh, my gosh, can we bowl? OK. So, the bowling alley. Let's go dark. Yeah. All right, let's switch on the IR. Oh, boy. That was right above us. That was a big one. That's so scary. It's another basement above us, too. Oh, man! What? What? Holy shit. Holy shit, did you hear that? Yeah. Something's walking, something... Sssh! Sssh! Just quiet, guys, let's hear what is it. Oh, fuck me. That really hurt. Yeah, dude, you're like a fish out of water. Sssh! That sounded like something, like, shuffling. Something was... It did not... ..moving for a long time, too. That sounded like something was like scurrying like towards us with chains. I don't know why that's in my head. It just kept going, that's when it really scared me, because it was coming towards us. Oh, man! Oh, man! Are you all right, Dakota? It felt like something that would actually attack, coming towards us. It started off slow. I was giving it a second and it just didn't stop, so I felt like I had to run. What? No way. It's caged off. Yeah. It's so people couldn't jump. That's so weird. This is a legit cage. It's so sad. What, what, what, what? Like an Indian chant. Where? Out here. What? Go, go, go. Give me the camera. It sounded like horses, at first. Then, all of a sudden, you could hear them go... So, me and Chelsea heard Indians way down there. We ran and got Coalin and Dakota. And they heard it, too. There's some weird things going on, on this ground. Dude, even the outside is creepy. Oh, my gosh. Sssh. What the hell is going on? If I'm looking at it from a realistic point of view, I'd say it's a recreation. The Indians are known to have been here. But also, at the same time, it's three in the morning on a Tuesday. It's 3am. What the hell? They did sound like Civil War people. Like Civil War shit. That's insane, it's so late right now. Just listen, one sec, I just want to hear it. I don't know what that was. I can't say that's a ghost just because, like, we're on this property. There's so much land out there. War grounds and we just heard Indians fighting. Both the Indians and the Civil War. It's really scary. But the only explanation I have is that it's some weirdos doing that late at night. Spooked me out. So we picked the four scariest rooms for the night. Tanner is drawing them out right now. This place is terrible. There's not one good place to sleep. Oh, fuck. What? The fucking suicide bathroom. Let me see. Oh! Tanner got the suicide bathroom. Coalin, do you want to go? Just put your hand in. East-wing hallway. That's not good. It's better than freaking everything else! That's the one I would want. You're gonna be like 400 feet away - Don't remind me. OK? I was really banking on the hallway. There's two left. Electroshock or... Bowling alley. Oh, if it's the bowling alley, I'm gonna cry, because I heard that stuff earlier. Bowling alley! Electroshock room. I'm actually happy. Of the two, that's really good, but that's still really messed up. Can we redraw? No, we're not gonna redraw. Should be if you get the scariest room one night, you shouldn't have to get it the next night. Well, if we do a sequel, that's what we'll do. I just feel like I... I look like the baby right now. I look like the girl who cannot do this, but I've drawn the scariest room every night almost. It's just bad luck. That's part of the documentary. Someone could get really screwed and you did. This really sucks. Sorry, geez. She's gonna be unhappy regardless. There's not like a good switch. I have... ..the crappiest location possible. The worst sleeping arrangement again. I have nothing else to say. So, I'm in the electroshock therapy room. This sucks. This is where they did all the electroshock therapy. It was a very painful death. Oh, God, holy crap. Behind me...is the room where four people took their lives. Just this long... hallway just down this way and then this... How are you supposed to sleep? This is the worst part of, like, this entire documentary. Sleeping alone by yourself in a haunted place is... ..just terrible. I have not been able to fall asleep yet. It sucks. Hello? Dakota! Dakota! Dakota! Dakota! Oh, my God. Dakota! Oh, shit. Chelsea? Dakota! Oh, shit. Chelsea! I'm coming! I'm coming! Dakota! Chelsea? Dakota. Dude, that was the scariest thing ever. There was that same sound that we heard before, the same exact sound. You scared me so bad. Like, seriously, I think there's actually something out there. I'm not even kidding. OK. I didn't see anything. I heard it. I heard two things. I heard one... I literally heard it twice. OK, let's, let's get out of here. Let's go. You're OK, come on. I hate all of this. Just come on. I'm sorry, just come on. Here, let's grab your camera. Turn it off, I'm done with this. I'm keeping it on, just in case something happens again. Let's just go. No, I'm literally done. I'm freaking done with this, I cannot do this any more. Tanner, no, it's me, it's me, Dakota. Oh, my God, dude! I'm sorry, I didn't try to scare you. Chelsea is, like, freaking out. She had something happen, she wants to like quit. Quit? Yeah, she wants to be done. What happened? She heard something. I don't know. She heard like the shuffling that we heard earlier. Yeah? Tanner will talk to her and, like, you know, he'll probably calm her down. You saw her last night, she was crying. Yeah, she was bawling. She... She was crying like this, dude, literally like crying again. This is just stupid, it's just... You can't, you can't, you can't think like that. You got to stop. I know you feel bad and stuff, but we didn't anticipate any of this happening. Dude, she's like... She's like...? Done. I don't know, like... I just was talking to her the whole entire time, trying to say, we have one last night. Any way you can toughen it up? Let's say you get the worst room, we'll give you the best room. If she would have got, like, a different room, one of the other nights, she would have stayed, but still... I'm gonna go talk to her. OK, man. I have a mic on me. I'm sorry. Sorry I made you go through all this. This is like... I'm just done. I'm just, like, so exhausted right now. I'm like bummed out that like I couldn't do it. I honestly don't know, like how... I did everything I could. You made it through four freaking scary nights, having to sleep in some scary-ass rooms. Tomorrow, when we wake up, I'm gonna call some airports. I'm gonna try to get you a flight home. If we can't get you a flight, you might have to stay in the RV or even at a hotel. Let's just go. Let's get out of this place. It's freaky. Seriously, though, like, you're a badass. That's... You went through some crazy stuff. All right. We're gonna go. Let's just get out of here. Chels, I hope you're OK. I'm gonna try to just find her a flight tomorrow. She's had enough. It's just, it's just... We got to go. All right. She's done. She's done. I mean, looking over the footage, all the movement and scuffling would scare the crap out of me, so I understand where she's coming from. The game plan is kind of changed up to three people, so we're just gonna have to adapt. All right, well... Are you sure you want to do this? I am ready to go. It was like, it was fun, like, as far as it tested me and stuff, but I think I've had enough. Yeah. Well, thanks for having me. I think the taxi is almost here. This is just weird, you're leaving. I know. This is so weird. It's gonna be such a different mojo, a different like... Yeah, that was... terrifying. Five nights in a row, that's a lot. Yeah. Yeah. That was the most scared I've ever been in my life. Hiya. All right. All right, I'm gonna give you a hug. Love you, Chels. Good luck. Yeah. Appreciate it. Good luck. Thanks. Damn. Yeah. Man. Let's go. This sucks. This does suck. All right, let's go. 01:12:40.840 -- 01:12:43.240 I think Dakota is pretty bummed out, dude. I think Dakota is pretty bummed out, dude. I know, ever since Chelsea's gone, he's been kind of just... a little bit more quiet. I don't know. As goofy as it is, saying this now, it's good for the film. You know she's gonna be all right. She's safe. She's back home now. Yeah. I mean... It's just like I'm looking at this footage and I did that to her. I put her through that. Put it on the backburner for the night. We can call her up tomorrow. Let's, uh, let's do this. Let's do it! I knew that'd help out! Why does a spanking make me smile? Here we go. Night number five. It's the last night. Well, now, it's just me in this hotel. This is gonna be... just a little bit different. Just a little bit different. Dakota, I think you're freaked out a little bit. I'm very freaked out. I know where we're going and I know the history. Man, it's a mess in here. It's such a mess. Like this replicates our brains right now. All right, Tanner. Excited to kind of find out where we're going? I guess that's a word I could use. We're here. We'll just walk a little bit into the woods. Dude, where the heck are you taking me? Into these woods, Tanner. Deep into these woods is where this place is. And it's not just one place. What? It's kind of weird not having Chelsea here to read it with him. I know. Yeah. We gotta finish strong. Like we said earlier, gotta finish strong. Shit. Night five. Pennhurst State School And Hospital. Opened in 1908, 20 miles into the woods away from society, Pennhurst was created for the purpose of separating the mentally deficient, mentally handicapped, physically handicapped and epileptic from society. Pennhurst was a place where we put away people who are different. We tried to isolate people with an intellectual disability, segregate them, sterilise them and remove them from the human race entirely. Pennhurst was part of that. Most people were sent here by families because they weren't allowed in a public school. They were stuck. So people like me, with PhDs, MDs, we told parents, "Pennhurst is the thing to do, the only thing to do." "It's the right thing to do." At the time, it was the best thing we had. For close to a century, 10,000 patients came through Pennhurst. Many have suffered unthinkable atrocities, including mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and even murder. I'd like to talk about the conditions here with a personal note. I came here first as a kid. 21 years old, just out of college. I walked into a room. A day room, with about 50 men, mostly naked. Rocking, self-stimulating, screaming, hitting each other and themselves and faeces everywhere. This was America. It's the wealthiest country in the history of the human race and I saw...this. I saw open wounds in cribs. I saw broken bones that hadn't been treated. People tied to their cribs and cages, tied up. I remember driving home crying a lot. My parents knew something was wrong. They said, "What's troubling you?" I said, "I just saw a place with more than 3,000 American citizens where we wouldn't put our dog for the weekend." Pennhurst soon became known as the shame of Pennsylvania and later became known as the shame of the nation. Wow. Damn, this is the real deal. Yeah, this is the real deal, dude. This one's bad. After two decades of complex litigation, Pennhurst was finally forced to close in 1987. A visitor at Pennhurst today can expect a wide array of unsettling experiences. From child voices, ghostly apparitions, slamming doors, poltergeist activity and evil presences. Dude, I fucking hate poltergeist shit. The spirits that are believed to be here are children. You've got to remember a lot of the children, they couldn't talk. They would make moaning sounds or they would bang a wall. You will hear thumping. You will hear screams. Some people have seen apparitions, shadows. We went on the third floor of the Mayflower Building, this building. When we turned around, it felt like something just pushed me right in the back. The first thing on my mind was "I got to get out of here." I find that, since there is a small number of you guys here tonight and it's kind of interesting what you're doing, I think the spirits are gonna be drawn to that, I think they're gonna be curious. Dude, these people were supposed to not be in society? Tanner, this place we're going to today literally...shut down other places like this. The places that we've been going this whole trip, most likely, were shut down BECAUSE of this place. Road closed. All right, see you guys! Dude, I don't want to fucking do this. What?! This is Pennhurst. Look at that, it's just decrepit and gross. Am I even going the right way? Oh, sorry, sorry. That was me. Tanner jumped and it scared me. Sorry. What, it's even bigger? Oh, I'm telling you, Tanner, like... this, like, when... There's a freaking light in there. There is a light in there. Coalin, are you on infrared? Yeah. You can't even see it on the infrared? I can see it. Weird. This is a totally abandoned building. Dude, that's not cool. This is a totally abandoned building. There's no electricity in there. Dude! This place is a sad place. It's a really sad place. It's a really sad place. Well, that's what I'm saying, like, these people didn't have a chance. Like, I have a cousin and... I couldn't imagine just dropping her off. And I have a cousin who is special. If he would have been born that much longer ago, he would have been... That's what I'm saying. ..treated like hell. They're still people. They're still human beings. 01:19:57.560 -- 01:19:59.560 Oh, damn. Oh, damn. You will leave. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? You will leave. You will leave. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? So, we just heard a voice. This is gonna be a good night. Whoa. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That is by far the most creepiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It's just sad. Those chairs are freaky. Dude, I hate those chairs. This one's got a full-blown belt buckle. This place has just... a bad vibe. I'm genuinely creeped out right now and sad. It's a weird mixture. My hand is killing me right now. Your hand? It's like a pressure. People get grabbed. Did it feel like something grabbed it? It feels like someone is just... gripping it. Ow. You OK? That's like really scaring me. I don't like this. I don't like the basement. It's dark. This feels like a gym area. This totally was the gym area. Look at this. A chalkboard. Yeah, this used to be a gym. The second floor looks just like the first. It's the way up to the third floor. That'll bring us to the third floor. Whoa. What was that? What? We started walking, there was footsteps. Like someone was just like following right behind us. Yo. This is the third floor. Yeah, this is creepy. I need to rest. Guys, I think we should just like chill here. You OK? Yeah. My neck just kills. Really? Yeah. You OK? No. You were fine, like, ten seconds ago. I'm just really creeped out. Let's, let's sit down. Oh, I'm so tired. Oh, man. Did you hear that outside? Right in the hallway. What is that? I can't hear it. That's the real deal, dude. Guys, there's something like crying or something really bad. Get right here, over here where I'm at. OK. Sssh! It's in the hallway. OK, this is bad, this is really bad. No, just stop. Stop. Stop. We gotta hear what it is. Do you hear it? Where's that coming from? Oh, my God. Yo. OK, OK. Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Just be quiet. That was louder. It was almost like a, a kid crying. Yo, dude, that is the creepiest thing ever in the whole world. Yo, dude, no joke, that is messed up. You OK? Dude, that was really scary. That was like a little kid fucking screaming. It sounded like a kid. A little kid fucking screaming. It's back. Sssh, sssh, sssh. Oh, my God, dude, this is like really, like hitting me really hard right now. I hear that as clear as day. We're in the middle of the woods and we're hearing a kid crying. If there's not a human in here, I don't know what the fuck that is. We need to go, we need to go out of here. Get in the hallway. Let's just get out of this freaking bathroom. 01:26:18.920 -- 01:26:20.520 It's back. It's back. I hear it, I hear it. It's still happening, but we're way too far away now. Quiet. Listen. Let's just sit. Just listen quietly. We need to find it. It's coming from the other side of the building now. Dude, it's everywhere. It's... We came over here. When we were right down that hall, right there, we were right in that hall, we heard it over here. Exactly. We ran over there and now we've heard it over here. It's toying with us, we're running back and forth and it's toying with us. Let's go down a floor. We've been on the third floor, we need to go to the second floor. Let's go this way. OK, OK, OK. Let's just see if it's outside. Dude, there's nothing out here. I don't hear anything either. That was inside. I don't, I don't know if I want to go back in. I really don't. I'm just like... It's... OK, so we've just picked the three scariest rooms. We've done this a million times. Tanner? First floor gurney rom. The first floor gurney room. I think that was the best one out of the three. Did you want the third floor? I don't want the basement. Basement gym room. Fuck! No! Come on! Oh, so I get the third floor. Rumoured to be the worst. Everything lives up in the... All the noises we heard? The third floor. Yeah. Active. The basement? We didn't hear that much. We were there ten minutes. OK, so... right now, I'm in the basement, in the gym room. It has all, like, the toys... right there. I literally can't see anything right now. Pitch black. Not pitch black. Pitch black. Not pitch black. Oh, my God. I don't know if you guys just turned on a camera, but I just heard knocking. So, I just picked the gurney room. I'm shaken up a little bit, to be honest with you. So, I got the third floor. Just where I did not want to go. So, it's gonna be great. I've got to do it. It's terrifying. The bed just creaked. What?! Oh, gosh! Oh, my God, that was really loud. Hey, Tanner? Hey, Tanner? Tanner? Coalin? Someone, please come down here! Tanner! Coalin! Someone, please! I can't move, I'm so scared. What? I'm fine, I'm fine. I just am really scared. Dude, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm just really scared. Like, I don't want to move, I am so scared right now. What happened? Dude, I am so freaking scared of this basement. Dude...this was a bad idea. All right, well, let's just... get out of here. We made it through five days. We freaking did it. Let's just be done. Tanner, freaking give me a hug, dude. Give me a hug. Holy shit, man. We fucking did it. Come here, brother. That's awesome. That was, literally, the worst week of my life. Yeah, me, too. I'm just so glad this is over. I get to go home. I get to shave. I get to take a nice shower. I get to sleep in a real bed. It was definitely awesome to be a part of. But, man, was it creepy. And, man, was it freaky. The mental exhaustion. The... You know, the physical exhaustion. Even the spiritual exhaustion was, it's a lot. It'll be interesting to see how, you know, being at home plays out. # We freaking did it, we freaking did it # We freaking did it # We did it, man. We did it. We did it. # The trail to terror! # # The trail to terror! # We did it and I didn't look like too much of a pussy! Just a little bit. It's been six months since Trail To Terror. I can't even describe what Trail To Terror was like for me. It was like living a nightmare every single night. There was not one night where I even felt close to comfortable. Now, six months later, I would say that there's definitely some... remnants of Trail To Terror. I'm definitely not fully recovered from it. I just felt, like, a darker presence around me...for a while. The initial, like, hit of everything, once you go through things like that, you just sit and think. It kind of reshapes, like, your whole reality. You just come back a different person. I think we all came back different people. Would I do Trail To Terror again? I know that, if we did it again, it might be even more locations, more everything and... I can't imagine more, I can't imagine harder. There's a part of me that would do it again. I really miss the adrenaline rush of being, you know, on edge and being scared all the time. I... I do miss it. There is this adrenaline factor. The kind of, like, rush you get when you watch a scary movie. You wish you didn't watch it, but a week passes and you kind of want to watch a scary movie again. That's kind of the feelings I have six months later. After doing Trail To Terror, I kind of have my own little theory on this paranormal stuff, just based off of our experiences. I feel that whatever it is that's in these places... it feeds off of fear. The paranormal, it feeds off of fear. I say that, because... it felt like almost every time we'd get more scared or more on edge, it would just get worse. I don't know why that is, but if that's true, then that means you can't get scared. And I want to continue to explore that. This... This whole experience just leaves me wanting more. subtitles by Deluxe
