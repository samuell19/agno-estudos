No One Heard the Scream - In two hours my plane takes off. - Elisa, always in a hurry. It's the appointed time. This morning, I made the wire transfer to your bank in Madrid. I love your gentleness and reliability, when you talk about these things. Maybe one day, I'll end up falling in love with you. Come on... It's not necessary we get to that point. I'm satisfied if you keep coming once a month to stay the weekends. Take your ticket... ...for next month. - Good afternoon, Madam. At your service. - Good afternoon. I want to cancel my ticket for the London flight, please give me back my luggage. The delay may take a short time. It's possible than in 1 hour your flight takes off. - Anyway, I decided not to travel. - Like you wish, Madam. Can you give me the ticket? Thank you. - Oh, I thought you was travelling Miss Elisa! - I've decided not to go away this weekend. - What!? - I've decided not to go away this weekend! You're going to fly this weekend! I've seen your luggage in the car. Do you need some help?! No. Who knows? Maybe I decide to go away. You're going to leave!? Ok... I thought you'll go away next week. When does his wife returns from the village? Monday. The new tenants arrive this Monday! The 3C apartment was sold! You'll not be so isolated. Glad to hear it. This under construction and solitary houses are depressing. Yes, they seem like very nice people. They are very refined. Ok, see you tomorrow. And you know it! If you need something you call me, a call'll do it! Hi. Good night. - I thought that you were away for the weekend. - Not this time. Something's broken? - A door bar lock, someone may get locked one day... - Be careful. Well, as an advantage... If I damage this one, there's always the one you used. Bye. Come on, Miguel. Stop playing with the elevator, it's getting late to go out. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - International? - Hi Miss. Tell me. Please, contact me with London. - Number? - 714-1121 Tell me yours, please. 279-7333 - We'll let you know. - Ok, I'll wait. Hello? I'm... I'm Elisa. Elisa! Are you in London? I've just called and they told me your flight was delayed. Look, I won't be going... - You won’t? But we have already agreed... - I know but I won't be going. That isn't serious. Even if you have plans that interest you more. - I've already made plans for us. - I'm sorry. I warn you, it'll be a while before I get to Madrid. I'll have to spend some more time in London. I wanted to talk about that. Don't call me when you get back. Is there any reason? There isn't any reason I can explain, it was a sudden decision... But... Isn't important, Oscar. Believe me, any importance. Listen to me, Elisa... You must remember... Hey, are you listening? I know you're there. Listen... we have to talk. It's necessary. You're not being rational, it's useless to lock the door. Completely useless... Do you hear me? I'll find out the way we can have a chat. Do you understand? I'm sure... I'll find the way. Hey, please... You must listen to me. What I've done isn't as horrible as you think. Is it possible to understand me, when I explain the facts to you. Open the door. And I have nothing against you. Besides, I think the dialogue is the only viable solution. It'd be absurd, you don't let me in to your apartment. I'll let in, anyway. We're alone in the entire building. At the moment, your apartment and mine are the only homes occupied. The rest are job offices and today's Saturday. You realize that? Under construction buildings have their advantages, but as you may see they have such inconveniences. Of course, I suppose you'll be reasonable, right? Are you there?! Do you hear me?! Please, answer to me. Hello? Hello!? I'm glad you opened. It would have been a pity breaking the glass. In this neighborhood, when something's broken they take some time to come and repair it. What are you going to do with me? That's something I'm wondering since I saw you in the lobby. You have a great whisky, really good... Real life prevails the same solutions that in novels. - Supress the witness. - You're going to kill me, right? At first, that was my thought... ...but 2 dead bodies is a little bit excessive, don't you think? Well... - There's a solution. - Which one? You must get involved in all my actions from now on. You're going to help me to get rid of my wife's corpse. I came to the conclusion... ...that simulating an accident in the elevator, it would be pretty naive. By contrast, if there isn't a corpse there isn't a murder. And if by some mistake, the Police find out about the crime... ...you'll be my accomplice. Do you understand? Not me... Oh yes, naturally. You're intelligent enough to know that it's better be alive... ...being accomplice of a murder... ...than an innocent victim... ...but dead. Ok? Ok. Please, don't lose more time. Get dress, we have a lot to do. You're an elegant woman. Beautiful dress. - An admirer's present? - Think what you want. Well, let's work... You already have tone in your phone, I put down mine. Someone may call and we have to act normally. But you won't do anything stupid, right? - Why did you take the bathroom's curtain off? - We don't know in which condition the corpse is. I'll try to do all the unpleasant parts myself. By the way, we'll need a scrub brush, water and detergent. If possible, biological detergent. I don't have any of those things in my apartment. The caretaker usually brings those things. Well, I'm sure I can get those things at home. Nuria was a wife always concerned about the cleaning. A wife always concerned about cleaning... ...absolutely everything. That was one of the many reasons that forced me to... Shut up! Shut up, please. I'll go to my apartment and get those things. As we spoke, you won't try anything silly, ok? Police, at your service. Don't interrupt me, please... My address is... - Hello? - Marmol building, Colonia del Este. - I witnessed a murder... and the killer is with me. - Police, hello? - Hurry up, please... - Hello? Police here...! Hello?! What? Checking if the line isn't dead, right? Why did you force me to use violence? I'm a peaceful man. You're a killer and your plan is ruined. I talked with the Police, they are on their way. Kill me if you dare to and... ...you'll have to pay for two murders. This is the mic of your phone. Nobody listened to you on the phone. Do you understand? Absolutely no one. As I supposed, poor Nuria's corpse must have hit the elevator shaft in her fall. Poor thing... she was a cleanliness freak. You can turn around if you need to. I understand if you think it's unpleasant. We have to continue on foot. It's not convenient we keep going down with the elevator. I'm afraid we're not going to see something very pleasant. You can stay here. It's enough for me if you stay close where I can see you. We have to put this in the trunk. - Let's go get the car. - There's someone downstairs? Go up. - Make him go away. - Who's there? - Oh! Hello Miss Elisa, something's wrong!? - No, a fuse blew but I've already changed. - Oh, I was worried. I've seen light in the cellar... - No, no! I've already switched on. You can go now. Oh sure, naturally! I can help you if you need. - Let's go down there. - No, I've already finished. No, no, I'm not tired. - I can help you in whatever you need. - No, I don't need you! You can go now! Ok, ok... Madam. I understand. I'm at your service for what you need. - See you tomorrow... - See you tomorrow. You had a very good behavior. Thanks. - Now, move on to the car. - I suppose we'll drive your car. No. Don't forget you're my accomplice. We'll drive your car. - Do you always use such a big suitcase? - No, I planned to travel with it. You're not thinking about using my suitcase for... No, naturally. I was just asking out of curiosity. Don't be so sensitive. If you tell me where are we going, I won't have to ask you at every turn. To a place you perfectly know. You showed off having a motorboard and a bungalow in San Juan's swamp. I hope it wasn't just a boasting. It's true. But I don't understand why you tell me this. That motorboard'll be very useful to us. My wife and I never managed to have a good relationship. Since one year, I had a lover. My wife is stupid, distrustful, a nasty mind person. Incapable of feeling something beautiful. You may ask, why did I marry her? Most common of histories... She was rich and I was in a job where just few people gain lot of money. I'm a writer. As you can see, I wasn't one the chosen who sell editions and more editions. My lover wasn't great but, in any case, much better than her. At last, it has happened tonight's deal. Be careful on your actions. Go on 100m and stop the car next to the turn. Keep it calm, act normally. One moment please, the Corporal is coming. Go on. Good night. There's been an accident and the village's ambulance isn't enough. You must carry some injured in your car to the first village you find. Please, we need your collaboration. Would you be so kind as to put that suitcase in the truck? That place needs to be empty. I'm afraid the suitcase doesn't fit. The truck is packed with things. With the best of intentions, we'll find some place. Listen, please Get the suitcase out of the car... - Hurry up with the suitcase, we can't lose more time. - But I'm sure it won't fit. Much better if I leave the suitcase here and pick it up later after I left the injured. - Is there any problem if we open the truck? - No, no. Is just a simple capacity problem. If we take out what's inside the truck, we'll be able to make some room. - See? You're going to break what's inside - No, no... Do you need some help? The lady seems seriously injured. That's it. - My nerves almost betrayed me. - It's ok. Thanks... for haven't tried anything stupid. Put it here. Be careful. - Slowly. - Take her legs. Slowly, more slowly. Good morning. Sorry for the inconvenience. Agent, all effort is short when it's about saving a human life. What I regret is that we need some more of your time. You must go through this difficult moment. - What's all about? - Just formalities. Come in, please. The guard said it would last a couple minutes, but this is taking forever. - I understand but you have to wait the judge. - Judge? The corpse inside the truck has complicated everything. But... Sorry, I'm very busy. The judge will arrive soon. - How did they find out? - Be calm. Don't forget two things: First, you're my accomplice... ...and second, I have a gun in my pocket. Come in. Good afternoon. I'm the examining magistrate. I suppose, you're the ones who carried the dead body. Well... ehm, I don't understand... Of course, you couldn't know that. The injured lady you carried in your car was already dead when you arrived here. What a tragedy... We already noticed she wasn't healthy when we picked her up. It's been an awful night. Anyway, we won't keep you long. You'll just give us your address to be stated in the report. Yes, there's no problem. AIways a pleasure contributing with the Law. I've been watching something weird for some time now. - Oh, you did? - Something dripping in the car's truck. It must be... ...the brakes fluid! No, it's something coming from inside the truck. He's right, honey... It's the canned oil we put in the truck. It has a non-drip cap that it may need an adjustment. If it's so, be careful. You'll damage what's inside. It doesn't matter. What we have there, it's unlikely to be more ruined. Shall we go, honey? Can you open the truck? Can we smoke a cigar, first? Isn't convenient we lose more time. It's too late. Well... take it. I'm sure you're surprised about my behavior and my help. You're behaving very well. Why? You were right when you thought that a woman like me would be the ideal accomplice... ...and that you could get rid of your wife. You're a decent, honest and worthy man. With a not very beautiful wife but also worthy, honest and decent. Then, I show up. The woman who lives in luxury without knowing why. Although, everybody assume it. And that decent and worthy man, isn't longer like that. Finding his wife, less and less beautiful. Less and less... ...let's say: bearable. I'm sure they would believe you if you told them that you killed her because of me. They would even apologize to you. I must say that I've been quite smart. I'm glad you are aware of that. You don't have to trust so much in your talent. Well, let's work. We've lost a lot of time. Hold my jacket. Here's the gun. But as always in this cases... With no bullets. It happens all the time in movies and crime novels. Don't play with the gun, you can blow a finger. What are you doing? Think about it. We need something to tie up the legs. Towards there. - There, to the river's bend. - To the left? Yes, to the left... Get me out of here! Come back! Come back! Get me out of here! Please! Get me out! We still can help each other! Don't blame yourself, I scraped myself with the motorboard. It would have been very easy to kill me. I can hardly swim. You didn't need to attack me with the motorboard. I've realized. But I'm not a killer. Why don't we enter the house? It's better if we have some rest before we come back. You have a very beautiful house. With everything you need. - That motorcycle wasn't there. - It's Toni's motorcycle. Who's Toni? Elisa... - I thought you were in London. - Toni, this is Miguel. Miguel, this is Toni. - Hi Toni. - Hi. Sorry Elisa. If I had known that you were coming I... It doesn't matter, Toni. - Is there some coffee? We would like some. - Yes, I think so. Cognac too. A drink would do you good. What happened to you? - An accident? - No, is just the mud from the bank... too slippery. I think I know you from somewhere. - Ehm... I'm not sure. - Miguel is my only neighbor. - Oh... of course, at the elevator. - What do you say? - Yes, at the elevator. We might of met each other once. - It's possible. You may be uncomfortable with those wet trousers. Elisa and I can go out for an instance while you dry yourself. They are some towels in the bathroom. Isn't bothering me. Besides, is a very hot day. Like you wish. It was an excuse for Elisa and I can talk in private. - Shall we go, Elisa? - I suppose, it's not an inconvenient for you. You can relax now, completely relax... I leave you the car keys. I assure you, I wouldn't ride Toni's motorcycle even with Jack's the ripper chasing me. Why did you leave him the car keys? - What game is this? - It was a joke. Why is he so wet? What happened to him? He already told you. He slipped in the mud. - There's something strange here. - Why do you think so? I don't know, this guy isn't like your usual companions. Oh, something else... Why didn't you go to London? You've already ruined, Toni. For an instance, I was excited that you were jealous. Elisa, you know very well those trips to London are very important for both of us. Why fooling ourselves? Yes, you're right. - Why fooling ourselves? - Do you want to be alone with him, right? - Yes. - Ok, I'll pick up my clothes and go to the swamp. I fancy going for a swim. Let's go. My... my aunt, told me that you need to talk about business. - I go for a swim in the swamp. - Doing right, boy. - I guarantee you, the water is cold here. - Well, both have a good time... You have a very grown up nephew. You care a lot for a nephew like that, right? You care enough to have the precaution... ...to not involved him in an issue like this. It's true? Yes, it's true. - Nobody answer the phone. - Hold on, they must be sleeping. They answered. Hi, is this the house of Miguel Cener? I'm talking from the Police court. No, nothing happened. Don't worry. I wanted him to know that he should come to the court on the 11th to give evidence. Yes, Mr. Cener and his wife have carried some injured people... ...one of the injured, died on the road. What? It wasn't his wife, the companion? Well... I mean, the lady who was with him. Anyway, pass this message to him. Ok, thank you... Bye. It seems like he's going to have a surprise when he gets home. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?! Hello?! Wrong number. Don't touch it, it can be infected. When you get home, I'll give you rubbing alcohol. I'll go to my apartment. - Someone may call. - I suppose the game's over, right? Yes, for the time being. Why don't you have some sleep? You look tired. - I'll come back later. - What for? We have to keep in touch, complications may come up. Well, if there's no other choice... They're some pending issues between us. Let's skip the formality... The usual thing to do between good neighbors, right? Do you think there's enough confidence between us? - What should I do? Open? - Of course. Behave naturally. Good afternoon Miss, this morning they called asking for your chalet's phone number... ...and like you gave it to me once, in case something happens... You don't remember?! That cousin of yours that came to visit you so often... - Ok, ok... - Well, they phoned this morning and I gave them your number. - You don't mind, do you? - Male or woman? - What do you say?! - If it was a male or a woman!? - A woman, I perfectly heard! - Please, if they call again don't give any numbers. Well... Sorry if I interrupt. I've just came here to let you know this. Thank you, see you tomorrow. No problem. At your service. It was the caretaker. - Yes, I heard. - He saw your jacket in the sofa. My mistake... He saw me with that jacket several times. Now, he can only think about two things: That I'm not away for the weekend... ...and that we are lovers. - None of those things worries me. - To you. It may not worry you. As for instance, I'm going to destroy the jacket. I'll go to my house. Both of us, need to rest. - Who is it? - Open. It's me. - How did you sleep? - You woke me up. - What time is it? - 8 o'clock. I could say I came here to keep an eye on you. Just for precaution. The truth is... I wanted to be with you. I would have preferred having some sleep until tomorrow. - Didn’t you have such a strong desire to see me? -No. You would wish to never see me again, right? Do you think there's a reason for you to have my sympathy? I experienced the worst hours of my life next to you. You know... You lie with such talent. - Why do you say that? - Yes, with great naturality. You lied to the caretaker, you lied to the Police, you showed yourself impassive with the Judge... You deceived me when you really wanted to kill me. And you fooled me again, when you rescued me with airs of compassionate heroine. Now, you show yourself cold and full of resentment. And that one... ...is your bigger lie. Leave me. Why? Don't try it again. But why? I don't understand why you are so upset. For you, this is like every other day. Elisa, sorry... Please... I didn't want to offend you. Look... we can go to dinner at some quiet place, where nobody see us. Then, we can have a drink at some Club. I promise I'll be kind. Do you want? I promise, really. - To the cynicism. - A strange toast. It's a sincere toast. - Do you know why we're cynical? - Why? Because we hadn't the opportunity to use the truth. It wouldn't be worthwhile. We are just what we are allowed to be. I never ask forgiveness for myself. Once, I read... I don't remember who said it... However much someone tries to divide humanity... ...at the end, they are two different kind of human beings. Those who buy and those who sell. We belong to the latest group. And sincerity was never a salesman's virtue. It would have been much better if we come to a more noisy and deafening club. With dancing couples and dizzy flashy lights. - Why? - We would become giddy. - I'm enough confused. - I don't think so. Why do you think we're here? Because we're both afraid. We don't want to go back to that house and find ourselves alone with the night. And with the shadow of death in every corner. - I don't believe in ghosts. - I do. But what we really fear is to find alone with ourselves... ...and realize that we are like two monsters... ...so cold, so insensitive. Capable of playing with death without the slightest qualm. Capable of playing with fear, even without being afraid. What are you going to drink? She's there. You weren't expecting her, right? Why not? I already knew she wasn't in London. I'll drink the same as always. She's with a new guy. He doesn't look worthwhile, keep an eye on her. There's your nephew. That's why you brought me here? You wanted to see him. I'm not sure, maybe. He's too young. Right? Yes, intensely young. It's been long time since you've known him? One year only. Do you like him or you just need him? I simply like him. I like him. Why don't you tell me about your lover? You told me in the car, that there's not much of her. Yes, exactly. My lover was... ugly... ...with bulging eyes, big nose... ...but I found in her, what Nuria lacked. And that's why you love her, despite her bulging eyes, big nose? Love her, as one use that word... Well... no. If suddenly, someone says to me that this girl has vanished forever... ...or she's dead, I would regret it while I smoke a cigar or drink some whisky. Then, I'll forget her. - Forever, as it happened without importance. - You give the impression of being incapable of love. Maybe you're right. When I was young and dreamed to be a famous writer... ...and imagined the bookstores full with my books... ...I wanted, I really wanted that illusion... ...as I also fought for many ideas I believed... ...and risked myself but... ...bookstores never sold any of my books... ...and those fellows and those ideas remain silent. Hi. - Hi, Toni. - Do I bother? - No, not all. We were leaving. - Yes, we were leaving. You're going to say that I'm annoying but I need to talk with Elisa again, in private. As you wish, you're her nephew and I don't want to be in a family discussion. - I leave? - No, wait here. I'll go to the bar with Toni. You're still sleeping with this guy, Elisa? What's wrong? You never dedicated yourself to "entertain" neighbors. Don't be such a pain. Nothing happens. - Is that what you wanted to tell me? - No, tomorrow is 26th. - So what? - The payment. It's deadline for the motorcycle. - How much is it? - 20.000 Shit, Toni! - It's more expensive each time! - If you don't want to help just tell me! Yes, Toni... I'll give it to you. - I'll leave you the check in the caretaker's office. - It's not necessary. - Can I go up to your apartment? - No, you can't. - Why not? - I don't want you to come ever again! And do you say it just like that? Just like that. - Like it all begun. - But Elisa... Look, Toni... ...you are young and attractive. I really know how it is to be young and attractive. You can have whatever you want. But not me. This guy seemed suspicious since the first time I saw him. Don't fool yourself Elisa, you'll come back with the London guy and myself. Put it on my check, Raúl. Along with what they have drank too. Something else to drink, Miss Elisa? No, you tell the manager not to worry with Toni's check. - He'll probably pay tomorrow. - Don't worry. Toni is a good customer. A very good customer. Let's go home. I like candle's lights. All in half-light. Like in a ghost's party. And with nostalgia. Even nostalgia for those things we never lived. Anyone would say that what unite us it's just a minor affair. But you have committed a crime. I'm not a murderer. Well, I mean... You don't know what it's like to feel like a bought object... ...continually stalked by some eyes... always too wrapped up on her property. Hate grows day by day, second after second, until the explosion... ...it's inevitable. Men always shared with me their moments of recreation, joy and rest. It was different with you. I had to help you... and even protect you. - What is that? - Two sleeping pills. Those things aren't convenient. I always wanted to stop taking these. Maybe, from now on, I succeed. You're going to take two pills? Yes, I want to have a deep sleep, get drowsy and sleep for hours. Nuria... Finally, you have woke up. I was thinking you would never do it. I saw your sleeping pills in the vanity table. I allowed myself to tear off the label to remember your name. Because, of course... One can't doubt of your efficacy. There's no reason to be afraid. I'm not a ghost. Really... I understand your surprise. Like me, I can see you're not used to surprises... I have to admit that I love surprises, yes... ...I'm fascinated by them... That's why this Saturday without let him know, I came in from my holidays. I had a feeling that I had something very important to do. You're not married, my friend. When a wife returns from holidays, she must do the cleaning. I can't understand how were you capable of doing it. I should have killed both of you. And now? What are we going to do? What are you going to do? Because this is all your fault. But you had to show up and see him. Don't blame yourself, dear. He always had complications with the simplest things. He was so impulsive. I can't understand why you killed him. You loved him. Maybe, what I did was just finishing an incomplete job. Did you know about us? About you and him, him and her, and the other and others... Poor deluded boy...! He tried to convince me that I had to stay away on Sunday. That way, you wouldn't hear me in the apartment. Of course, I had to keep an eye on you. It was a security precaution. He wasn't only a cynic but also a stupid. If you only knew how convincing he was when he talked about getting rid of you. Shut up! Didn't you have enough proves of his cynicism? One thing for sure, he was sincere... ...when he told me that you were the one he had killed... ...he wasn't lying. With every single word, every desire... ...he was really killing you. Let's not discuss between us, my dear. On the contrary, I offer myself to make you the breakfast. Let's see... What do you want? Tea, coffee? Come on... tell me, what do you fancy? What do you want? Better you eat something because now, my friend... ...you'll have to help me to make disappear that corpse. After all, you have an enviable training. But... No one heard the scream.
