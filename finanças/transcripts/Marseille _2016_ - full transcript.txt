FOR VALERIE Hello, Jean-Marc! Everything OK at the office? Fine. Don't worry. I'll be back in Montreal in two weeks. Relax, Paolo, I've got it under control! And if they're not biting, I've got weenies in the freezer. Have fun! I was born by the sea. Fishing's second nature to me. So your weenies will be there when you come back. Don't worry about that! Sam, you know fish... They're freaking out. We'll have a feast! Watch out for the bones. Call Mom after lunch. Today at 11:08 a.m. -It's the machine. -Leave a message! Eat! Fish is lousy cold. Hello, Paolo. It's Joseph. There's a problem. It's Dad. He got hit by a scooter. It's serious. He's in the hospital, between life and death. But closer to death. Paolo, you have to come. Call me back. Love you! Ladies and gentlemen, the bar car will remain open right up until our arrival in Marseille. If you'd like to take advantage of one last aperitif, we invite you to relax in car 4, at the center of the train. We offer a wide assortment of treats: Kit Kat bars, MnMs, Twix, hot and cold beverages. Maurice will greet you with a smile and good humor! For your comfort, this train is equipped with a... a defib... a debrifi... a defipri... defribi... Wait, I'll get it! A debridi... Shit! Just don't get sick! There he is! How are you, Paolo? I'm so glad to see you! Me, too! -You work out? -No way! Say hello to your uncle. No, I want a hug, little Amato! -How old are you? -Almost 13. Let's go. I'll take that. We're not too late? No, I just got here. The tunnel was jammed! I'm in the drop-off lane. I meant for Dad. No, Dad's OK. He's hanging on. What's he doing? Dumb-ass, get out of the way! Easy, guys! I was gone five minutes. I'm fucking working! Move that bumper car! -My brother came from America. -I came from Joliette. What do I care? No suitcases? We're not staying long. Think you're in Paris? Move, asshole! Wash your mitts before you touch my car. Hey, skinhead! Move your testa rossa. Hey, Mao Zedong! Don't look at me like that! They say Buddhists are calm. Bullshit! Back up, Obelix! Can't you see I'm wedged in? Joseph, you parked backwards. Backwards? I'm not backwards. It's the right direction. I'm in the right direction. The direction of my car. Do you have AC? Sure. There you go. Thanks. So how did it happen? Dad was at the market. He crossed the road and a scooter ran a red light. Dad was thrown eight yards, as far as the newsstand. He landed on a pile of newspapers. Then he lost consciousness. If those papers hadn't broken his fall, he'd be dead. Then the firemen came and took him to the hospital. Fuck! Life is so fragile! Are you hungry? Should we stop by the house? Go straight to the hospital, so Sam can see him before it's too late. You OK, Sam? Not too tired? Got any sleep on the plane? I watched six movies. I couldn't sleep. But on the train, I got some shut-eye. Is he going to talk like that the whole time? Fuck! Did you get taller? Is it here? Yeah, it's here. Hello. We're here to see Mr. Amato, in neurosurgery. I'll call the doctor. Dr. d'Acremont, Mr. Amato's family is here. How long does he have? Two or three days. Tell me the truth, is he in pain? No, not anymore. Can we go in? Of course. No, my son and I will go in alone. Is that possible? Thank you. There he is, Sam. That's your grandfather. My father. He's very emotional. Are you alright? Don't get so worked up. I do what I can. He doesn't have long left. We'll transfer him in a couple days. How does it work? Do we take the body? The hospital? You go to the discharge desk. The discharge desk...? The morgue! No, the discharge desk. Once he's stabilized, he'll go to the Cranial Trauma Center. Why send him there? For his rehab program. He has slight amnesia, but that's common in this kind of accident. It's not serious. He's fine. You mustn't worry. Are you saying he's just asleep? Yes, he's asleep. He's resting. Visits are good for him. I'll stop by to see him later. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Doctor. Joseph! Do you realize? We just traveled 3,000 miles for a bump on the head! I was scared, Paolo. I imagined him in his grave. The doctors didn't say it wasn't serious, at first. Then you were already on the plane. Wouldn't you have called me? I didn't put a gun to your head. "Between life and death!" That's what you said! Yeah, but the head's serious. Look at Aunt Odette. She bumped her head in the tub and two days later, she died. She died because she drank toilet bowl cleaner! What do we do? Stop at the house to drop off your stuff? You're staying with us! No. I reserved an Airbnb, so we wouldn't intrude. BNB? Who's BNB? It's no one. They're people who rent out their apartments. People in Marseille? Strangers? You don't you want to stay with your family? At home? Finally! You're as pretty as ever! And you're still a flatterer. Is this Sam, your son? You're adorable! Not too tired? Did you get a little sleep? I watched six movies. I couldn't sleep. But on the train, I got some shut-eye. We're happy you're here. Know where they wanted to stay? At H and M! Airbnb, Joseph! We didn't want to bother you. No, I made up your room. I made meatballs! Joseph said you like meatballs. -She's Corsican. -I love meatballs. Didn't you see Diego? He's playing outside. -Diego! -Be right up! -How's Giovanni? -Good. -That's good, isn't it? -Yes. I thought he had both feet in the grave. "Between life and death. Closer to death." That's Joseph! Always exaggerating! That's Marseille. You're from Marseille, too! Plaid shirts don't make you American. Canadian! Same thing! No, it's not. Canada isn't America! Different countries, different laws. And a bump on the head isn't "dying"! Being Asian doesn't mean you're Buddhist. Stop with that! Stop talking bullshit. Hi, Uncle! -Who's this kid? -Diego. You've changed! The last time I saw you, you were two, on a picture. -How old are you now? -12. Like your cousin, Sam. Sam, this is Diego, your cousin. Hi, Diego. What's that? The Caribou, the Canadian high-five. -Want a Pastis? -No, I'll have whiskey. Like a cowboy! Whiskey! Classy! Dad once said, "Whiskey's so strong, it burns the hair on your balls." Diego! Show your cousin your room. I see! It's Momo's and Barnaby's room, the neighbors' kids I babysit. I can move the toys into Diego's room. No, it's fine. Perfect, thanks. I'll let you get settled. You play football, Sam? -What's that? -You don't know football? "Soccer," Sam. He's asking if you play soccer. I've played with my friends. Ever heard of Mandanda? The goalie for OM? Sam plays ice hockey. Not football. Steve Mandanda's the best goalie in the world. You talk so weird! With time With time, everything disappears And you feel old and gray like a weary horse And you feel frozen on a bed of chance And maybe you feel alone, but at peace And you feel hazy from the lost years It's really true With time You love no more And the guy on the scooter? They never found him? It may be a stolen scooter. Sure it was. They're probably burning it in the projects now. Even if they're not, just try to find it. It's easier to go to the moon, than get into the projects. They're kids. The younger generation's got no respect. Nobody wears helmets. They'd rather die than mess their hair! Only in Marseille! Is it like that in Canada? No! The cops see to that. Can I use your internet to check on flights home? Why? You wanna go already? Yeah. Where? Home! We were on vacation. Take a Marseille vacation! It's a paradise, you nutjob! We've got everything, the sun, the sea. You can take the kid fishing. Over 20 miles of coastline. 400,000 people take cruises here every year. -It's the European Culture Capital. -That's true. Plus, it's central. You can swim in the morning, ski in the afternoon, then zip over to the Calanques! Without a helmet! Bedtime, kids! Diego, where are your pajamas? Those are his pajamas. -Good night. -Good night, everyone! Good night, kids! Five minutes and lights out! Does St√©phane know I'm here? I don't know. No reason he would. We don't talk much. I'll stop by the hospital before I go. Perfect. Alright! I'm gonna lie down a bit. You're going to sleep! Like the chickens? Chickens? You have sophisticated expressions in Canada! You got wifi? I don't know. I think so. Look! We must have apples, pears, bananas. Make yourself at home. Good night! Yeah, good night. What's up, Joseph? Hi! Tampico! Where's Daouda? Hey, you deaf? Who are you? Hello! Now, the scandal that's shaken Marseille. This weekend, Miramas was host to the pistou soup world championships. The Aubagne team was suspected of using garlic powder in its recipe. If you recall, that same team was also accused of trickery last year, but at the time... Hello! He has a little cough, so I put paracetamol in his bag. Call if you need me. No problem! Goodbye! Thank you. -Have a nice day. -You too. -That's Diego's uncle. -Hello. -Slept well? -I slept. Joseph's really tough! 5 a.m. every morning! He's got no choice. Times are hard! Sometimes he works double shifts. But he's in good health! Most have lung problems and take early retirement. What about Joseph? Clean as a whistle! His words. Good morning, Uncle! -Still in your PJs? -No, I'm dressed! How's it going? Slept well? Yeah, but the jetlag's far from over! Sure! Shall we take Sam with us, so you can go to the hospital? Sam, wanna watch Diego play football? He only wears plaid shirts. As if they don't have stripes yet in Canada. He came with his son, Sam. When he talks, it sounds like he swallowed a duck. Canada's not right next door. And he lives in the middle of a pine forest! Why couldn't he move to Italy? That's just behind the Calanques! But the jerk goes to Canada! If Italy's just behind the Calanques, Greece is just behind the Goudes. And Canada's just behind Carry-le-Rouet. And behind Marignane, there's America. And behind the rollers and brushes... There's us! -Hey, Gabi! -Are you going home? Yeah. I'm waiting on the bus. Hold on! Mind if I drop my cousin off? -It's on the way. -As long as there's no detour. That's not my style! And I won't turn on the meter. Fine. Hello, sir. -How are you? -Fine. -Thanks. -You're welcome. How's the wife and kids? Everybody's fine. Better than the OM, anyway. -Did you watch the game last night? -I don't have cable. But I'll tell ya, paying to watch those jerks... You're right. No, I watched a movie. It was a blast! What was it called again? What's the story? Sometimes that can trigger the title. It has that guy who sells the coffee pods. You know, that handsome guy... Sure you do! There's him and this actress. You know her, too. She's famous. Sandra... Sandra... Bollock, Ballock... I don't know. And they're in space. They're mechanics. They fix satellites, for TV and stuff. Everything's fine. Then Houston calls. "Watch out, guys! "A satellite's about to explode. The debris are coming right at you! "Get the hell out of there!" Where can they go? They try, but no way! Then the guy with the capsules has a machine. He takes off. He runs out of gas and disappears. There's nobody in space! The other guys, we don't know. They croak. Who cares? Then Sandra Ballock's all alone. She's attached to the shuttle with a rope. The rope breaks, she goes flying. She finds a fire extinguisher! That saves her! Two whacks... She finds a Chinese satellite. The keys are inside. She goes home. What suspense! Ring any bells? -Gravity. -What? The movie's called Gravity. That's it! Great or what? Yeah, it's good. What a blast! I never would've guessed. So you saw it, at least? No. Cholesterol, cholesterol! What a pain in the ass! Doctors think sausage is a weapon of mass destruction. Gimme a break! It depends. Look at my father! For 50 years, he's eaten cold cuts. But Corsican! It's has no cholesterol! Sure, if you eat any old cold cuts, it's fatty. Understand? But the fat in Corsican cold cuts is delicate. It's superior fat. It's not the same! In fact, Corsican cold cuts have good fat. Awesome fat. No connection at all! It's simple. Eating Corsican sausage eliminates cholesterol. There's no cholesterol in Corsica! Mr. Amato! -Be strong! -What is it? He slept well, he's stable. He can leave tomorrow. Would you like to sit? A glass of water? Was I that ridiculous? No, I'm teasing you. He's still a bit confused, but he's better. He'll be happy to see you. Are you alright? Fuck... Fine, thanks. Hi, Dad. It's me. It's Paolo. It's me, Dad. It's Paolo. Hi, the tunnel was jammed. -What's going on? -He doesn't recognize me. That's normal. It's been 25 years. Dad... Dad, do you recognize me? They're your sons, Mr. Amato. They came to visit. We'll let you rest. I'll stop by again later. He can't see. Otherwise, he'd know us. Come with me. He's got a draft in his head. You can't release him. He's being transferred, not released. It's standard procedure. I know it's not easy, but he's fine. Don't worry. Well, I'm worried. Good luck. Thank you. Goodbye. Loulou, run! Go, go, go! Go, guys! Great! Well done! -Good job, Diego! -Great! So what happens next? He's fine, but he needs time to get his memory back. And I don't have time. You bought your tickets? Provisionally. Dad never used to talk much, but now... Don't worry. The doctor said he'd be fine. The firemen said the first person he asked for was you. Shoot! See that, Mom? He's offside! Can't sleep? No, jetlag. Will you ever stop thinking about it? I don't want to talk about it. He asked for me? What else? I don't know, that's what the firemen said. Whatever your plans, I can't leave work for Dad's transfer today. -I can ask a coworker. -I'll do the transfer. Go to work, I'll keep you posted. Take the car. I'll call you later. Have a good day. You too. Up already? What are you doing? Studying before the kids wake up. While I still can. Studying what? For my boating license. What for? To get a job in Marseille, a boating license is a plus. You going back to work? We can't make ends meet. Even with Joseph working like a horse. Second generation salt scrapers, same tools, same pay. We barely scrape by. It's fine. Now you take tests in Marseille? No more payoffs? Tradition's going down the drain! -It's not my car. -I didn't say a word. Everything OK? How are you, Dad? It's Paolo. We're taking you to another hospital. Thank you, sir. Come on. It's OK, Dad. It's me. You can get in. Relax. Goodbye, Mr. Amato. He looks better. I'm glad! It's just a matter of days, I'm sure. That's for Dr. B√©guin at the Center. I called him. He'll be his doctor. -Keep me posted, OK? -OK. -Bye. -Bye. Thank you. I don't have your number! Are you comfortable? Joseph said you asked for me at the accident. I'm here now. Are you playing with me? You'll share a room with Mr. Santiago, who just arrived. He's a young man. I'll let you get settled. You have a lamp here. This is an alarm. Sit down, Dad. If you have any problems, ring it. OK. You have a few closets and drawers. Get settled and I'll alert Dr. B√©guin. OK, thanks. Do you want me to stay? Tell me. Don't you want to talk? I'll go see the doctor. That's why the name's different. Hello. -Yeah, hello. -Mr. Amato. Yes, hello! Dr. Gilbert B√©guin. To start, I encourage you to bring him personal objects, like pictures for his room. With amnesia, anything could trigger his memory. A taste, a smell, fond memories. Your wedding pictures. My brother's wedding. He's your father. You share memories. Yes, distant memories. Anyway, he needs his family. That's extremely important. Try everything. It could come back quickly. Any questions? Why won't he speak? May I help you? We're here to see Louis Santiago. -You're family? -Only family. Fine. Hello. Sir. So... -Hello, sir. -Sir. Goodbye. "Crocolou loves Santa Claus. Tomorrow's Christmas. "He wants to visit Santa in Lapland. "So he hops on a sled, crosses the snow-blanketed forest, "and finally reaches Santa's house! "Hello, I'm Crocolou! "Come in and warm up, my boy!" "What blasted wind did you ride in on? "I came to help you, you jerk! says Crocolou, all timid like." Diego! Sam! That's not funny! -We'll have another round. -Coming up! Show me Brigitte Bardot's ass and my memory'd come back! It'll never come back. That's how it is, at that age. It's the illness of old age. Poor Giovanni. My mother's sick, too. When I visit her, she says, "Why didn't you come to my wedding?" No, it's not an illness. It was the impact. The illness is Alzheimer's. Your memory never comes back. He's still got his memory. It's just lost. Show him the '93 finals against Milan! Basile Boli's goal! His memory will snap right back! It's OK! They're family! Go! I'll be right up. It's Sam's mother. Hi, Florence. Got your bullet-proof vest? No! It's safe here. And how's Sam? Sam? He's having a ball with his cousin. Is your dad any better? Yeah, much better. If all goes well, we'll be home by the weekend. Get a load of that shirt! I have to go, Florence. -I'll explain... -Is there a problem? Sam and I will call you back. Bye. Kisses! Look, he's ignoring us! This guy's a cop, for sure! Is that a Playmobil? No idea. It's not my car. Got it at Toys R Us? Maybe. You have to ask my brother. I, uh... I'll check upstairs. I won't be long. Hi. What are you looking for? Fuck, you scared me! His slippers. They're over here. I don't know what to take. Get his clothes. I'll get the pictures. -What are you waiting for? -Nothing. Family photo! Smile! On vacation! -Make a video! -The whole family! Slippers. -Pajamas, too. -They're here. I'll take this. Maradona's actual jersey! He wore it in Torino. Let's go, I'm illegally parked. Some kids were hanging around the car. There's nothing to fear here. -Fuck! -What is it? Fuck! -Those motherfuckers! -Shit! Those jerks! They've got nothing better to do. Fuck! -Bye. -Goodbye, sir. -Bye. -Bye. MAYOR OF THE 5TH ARRONDISSEMENT. STEPHANE AMATO WHISHES YOU A NICE VACATION How are you? FERNANDEL WAS BORN ON MAY 8, 1903 DIED FEBRUARY 26, 1971 FAMILY Meet Diego, Grandma! "Diego", Dad, like Maradona! Easy, Dad! He's only 6 months. You shoudda picked an older one. Giovanni, not in front of the baby! FOR MY GRANDPA! SAM Count, Paolo! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13! OK, Uncle, you can go take a nap. St√©phane, you're better with a ball than a pen. What'll become of you? Center forward for the Olympique de Marseille! The family idiot! Good evening, Mr. Amato. You can't sleep? My name is Pierre. I'm your nurse. I'll take care of you at night. You don't feel well? No. May I? Is she your wife? Obviously, she is. She's gorgeous. Were you thinking about her? Do you miss her? You don't know? That's normal, you know. You had a blow to the head. So it's normal that you've lost your memory. But little by little, it'll come back. And one day, you'll remember everything. You'll remember your wife's smile, the best years you spent together. It'll come back. Don't worry, OK? Would you like something to help you sleep? Yes. Here. What's my name again? Giovanni. Yeah. Giovanni! A beautiful name. Thank you. Be right back. Giovanni. -Hello. -Hello, sir. Hi, Dad. I brought you meatballs. Val√©rie made them. You'll have a feast! Come on. Eat a little something. It'll do you good. -How is he? -Who knows? He won't talk. He doesn't even recognize meatballs! Hold on. Excuse me. -Excuse me. -Yes? Do you know "Volare"? "Volare"? I can try. Thank you. Remember him? Look. Go OM! Go OM! Boli's in line, Dessailly at the second goal post. And Boli scores! An extraordinary head-butt! Dad, look who's here! Sorry. Fuck... Hang in there, guys! Thanks. -Wasn't that Basile Boli? -Exactly! You recognized him? Dad didn't. He was his idol! Don't lose hope, Mr. Amato. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes slow. Fast or slow? Who knows? He's in good hands. Mr. Boli! Come on, Joseph. Mr. Boli. She's not here today. She's in the E.R. Is there anyone in this fucking hospital? What are you looking at, asshole? -What happened? -It hurts! -You don't know? -No, fix it! You've been shot. Figure that out on your own, asshole? What's going on? Calm down, or I'll throw you out. Take him in. I'll examine him. What are you doing here? It's not the time. You're still here? Are you OK? Yeah. It won't start. Sorry about earlier. It wasn't like this before? It's not my car. -What's the problem? -I don't know. It's the driving belt. It's shot. Really? No idea! I don't even know what that is. Here's my brother. Good night. You need a garage, not the E.R.! What's wrong? It won't start. It's kaput! I'll take you home and come back. Got a helmet? Yeah, here. And you? Got one for you? -No. -Here. -Now you don't have one. -No. -Here. -What about you? -I don't have one. -Here. Can I drop you off? May I ask you a question? Yes. Why did you hide when your father opened his eyes? I hadn't seen him in 25 years. When I was a kid, I did something really stupid. My father threw me out. I left Marseille, moved to Canada and never came back. Why are you telling me all this? Maybe so I can finally stop obsessing about it. You never saw your brother again either? -No. -Didn't you miss him? And you? What? Didn't you miss me? What? Do you have family here? What do you think? In the back, is that a child's seat or a barbecue? Thanks for the lift, uh... Elena. Paolo. My pleasure. -Keep me posted. -Will do. -Have a nice evening. -You too. I can't find the key for the lock! I can't find the key for the lock! Help me bring it inside. Otherwise, there'll be nothing left. Let's go! Push! Son of a bitch! Trump! Here. And master diamond! -There, sonny! -Again? -That's how it's done! -Another hand! Loser buys the Pastis! In yesterday's paper, I read about a guy who stole a tractor. Just try to find a guy with a tractor in Marseille! And the cops couldn't catch him? A tractor goes two miles an hour! I've ridden on a tractor. They go so slow, the view doesn't even go by! How can they catch thieves? I once saw three cops in a station wagon. They're not for chasing crooks, they're for going on vacation! Going to the beach! 80 spades. You open. 80 spades. 90 diamonds. 100 spades. And what do you think? I can't estimate. It could be days or months. He doesn't react. He doesn't recognize us or speak. What more can we do? -Wait. -He may as well go home. He won't have a hospital bed or a nurse. Who'll take care of him? I'm a doctor, I know. He's safe here. So be nice, let me do my job. That doctor's full of shit! Stop! He knows what he's doing. Isn't Dad fine here? See how he is in his room? As limp as a slice of cold pizza. I have an errand to run. Paolo! Hi, Zia. Don't be mad at your uncle. After your foolishness, he and your father had a falling out. The family split apart. We don't see anyone. Nothing could change his mind. I just wanted to apologize. Don't worry, I'll tell him. I didn't think it would destroy the family. As they say in the old country, "It's better to be far from friends "than close to enemies." How's your father? And Joseph? Fine, don't worry. Take care, Zia. Paolo, don't act like your fathers! I'm going to the V√©lodrome! I'm going to the V√©lodrome! I'm going to the V√©lodrome, Mr. Florist! I'm going to the V√©lodrome, Mr. Fishmonger! I'm going to the V√©lodrome, Mr. Grocer! I'm going to the V√©lodrome, Mr. Butcher! He's going to the V√©lodrome! I'm going to the V√©lodrome! Mom! I'm going to the V√©lodrome! That's great, Diego! Bring me a jersey! -What did he say? -He's going to the V√©lodrome! Mom! Congratulations, sweetheart! He'll be on TV! He'll be on TV! We haven't seen you for a while, Jean. How are you? I'm OK. It's my grandson. He has no work, so all he does is screw up. He's 19. My son and daughter-in-law are worried sick. So I thought, since I watched you grow up and I've known your father forever, maybe you could do something for him. Does he have qualifications? No diploma, but he's a good kid. He just needs a hand. I'll see what I can do. No promises, but I'll do my best. Thanks, St√©phane. You're a good man. Hello, Mr. Mayor. You don't know me, but I know you. I voted for you. Thank you, ma'am. Eleonor, not ma'am! My upstairs neighbor is completely bonkers. She wears heels like this at home, 16" heels to walk from room to room. It's so loud! It sounds like a pony! And get this! She wears slippers to go buy bread. It's just to piss me off! Do something or there'll be a murder in the neighborhood! Fine, ma'am, I'll see what I can do. -Do we have your contact info? -Yes, Mr. Mayor. Goodbye, ma'am. Please, sit down. I'll be right with you. Go on, St√©phane, jump! Don't be a pussy! It's really dangerous! It's so rocky! Jump, St√©phane! Let go, Paolo! Come on, St√©phane! I'll hold you! Fuck! St√©phane! If you knew how much I hate myself, St√©phane. I wish it had been me. Everyday I think I should have been in your place. I imagine the hell you've gone through. The operations, the months on convalescence. I shouldn't have left. I'm OK. The worst is flying. I have to take it off to go through the metal detector. Otherwise, do you like Canada? Yeah. Yeah, it's... It's good. It's American-style. It's organized, it's impeccable. Beautiful house, nice car, a good business, nice coworkers... An ultra cool ex! A terrific kid. On Sundays, I play ice hockey. You're bored to death. Exactly, I'm bored to death. Hi! Diego's going to the V√©lodrome! -To see a game? -My club's making an entrance! He's going to be on TV! -With Mandanda! -That's great! Go OM! -I poured you a whiskey. -I'll have a Pastis. Isn't it Pastis time? That's disgusting! I need a rinse! He pulls out Gignac when they're winning 2-0. I understand. He wants to maintain the score. He brings in a defensive midfielder. But then they score 2 goals! We need 3 points! We only get 1! Next week, we play St-Etienne, then Monaco, then Toulouse. The championship's not in the bag. Oh, right. I'll go. Lila! Let go, you're hurting me. Calm down. Let him go. I can't take it anymore! Please! I wanna go home! It'll be OK. Calm down. No, please! -Calm down. -Everything's fine. We came to see Joseph. -Why are you here? -We came to see where you work. Daouda, my brother and nephew. The American! Show the kid our boat. How nice! Come with me. Are you OK? Yeah. -Are you done? -For today, yeah. But the boat's leaving in four days. My smokes! Jo, tell him I painted the draft! OK, I will. I was at your wedding, Joseph. What? I came. I didn't want to miss it. I was across the street. You were on the church steps. There was a crowd. You were handsome. Mom was smiling, with Diego in her arms. I think Dad saw me. Our eyes crossed. I didn't dare go in and ruin the party. So I left. See how clean the boat is now! Then you can paint it. They'll go right up to the anchor! Can you eat the mussels? No! They're rotten when they fall off. The quartermaster and his mate are up top. They're our bosses. They oversee our work. Hello! What are you doing here? I hear it's the best celery in town! Wait until you try the carrots! Why are you here? To tell you how I'm doing. How you're doing? You got some balls! I don't have your number. I don't know what you do after work! That depends.

We can project anything, we can add windows, flames. Whatever you want. We've done tons of buildings, monuments. I'd like to have an old Brooklyn building, like in Once Upon a Time in America. Dad, can we go back? I don't wanna be late! Diego, it's 11 a.m. and the game is at 9 tonight. -Is it biting, kids? -The fish are freaking out. Didn't you miss all this? And the guys?

Hello, 2nd arrondissement police station calling. -Is this the home of Joseph Amato? -I'm his wife. We've found an individual who may correspond to the description you submitted. Is he alright? Yes, but he can't identify himself. Could you please come by to identify him? Of course, we're on our way. Thank you. Hello. Mr. Amato? Across the hall. He's in here. -Hello. -Hello. We're Mr. Amato's sons. Is he OK? Where did you find him? In a stairwell. A bit tired, but he's OK. Are you OK, Dad? -Can you identify him? -Giovanni Amato. Born May 19, 1931 in Manarola, Italy. You gave us a scare. Don't ever do that again! -Can we take him? -Sure. Just sign here, please. Thanks. Are you OK, Dad? Excuse me, that's my jacket. Thanks. Goodbye, Mr. Amato. Sorry, I was stuck in the tunnel. Mr. Amato, we were so worried! Don't ever do that again! -They found him in a stairwell. -At least he was warm. We'll take you back to the Center. No way! He's going home! -Who'll take care of him? -We are! Enough is enough! Come on, Dad. Enough is enough! Understand? Gentlemen! He had this with him. Thank you. Dad, this is your apartment! You even said you hid your savings here! I'll turn on the TV. Remember? You like watching dumb TV shows. Did you even forget your dumb TV shows? Fuck. What's that about savings? His savings. He doesn't trust banks. Everything he has is here. That's what you were looking for under the bed! Yeah. If anything happened to Dad, he'd never come back here. They'd send the movers... And there goes the nest egg! Don't talk nonsense. Nothing'll happen to Dad. His savings will come back with his memory. In the meantime... there's a bundle of cash around here. Bills of every color! Blue... yellow... purple... A rainbow of moolah! And that's the best kind! Sorry, Dad. Otherwise, we'll go crazy!

Seven-hour lamb with Asian spices, in a sandwich! -And for you. -Thanks so much! -It's our specialty. -Really? I was wondering if... my father's amnesia is hereditary. Why? I never want to forget this moment. Compliments of the chef. Thank you. To Marseille! Joseph!
