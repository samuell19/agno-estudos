THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. ALL MY LOVE TO YOU AND CHRISSY NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER SPECIAL MOMENT ON THE BILLBOARD MUSIC AWARDS LET'S HEAD TO ATLANTA AND WELCOME MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS. THANK YOU, KELLY. I'M THRILLED THAT THIS IMPORTANT MOMENT OF BILLBOARD MUSIC AWARDS IS BEING HELD AT ATLANTA'S APEX MUSEUM OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY. NOW WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THESE ARE HARD TIMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AMERICANS ARE LIVING WITH THE IMPACT OF COVID-19, ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, AND THE CRUSHING PAIN OF SYSTEMIC RACISM IT IS IN THESE MOMENTS THAT WE LOOK FOR LEADERS WHO WILL NOT JUST TALK THE TALK, BUT WALK THE WALK WHO WILL ANSWER THE CALL WHO WILL RISE UP AND FIGHT FOR THE CHANGE WE NEED AND IT IS IN LIGHT OF THIS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING YEAR THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE ARE HONORING JUST SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL ONE WHO WILL FOREVER BE KNOWN AS THE INAUGURAL BILLBOARD CHANGE MAKER. IT IS THE FIRST WHAT WAS WILL BE AN ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THIS SHOW, WHERE WE SHINE THE SPOTLIGHT ON A PERSON OF COURAGE, A CHANGE MAKER WHO NOT ONLY IS A FORCE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, BUT WHO HAS SHIFTED THE CULTURE BEYOND THE STAGE. OUR INAUGURAL RECIPIENT IS A HIP-HOP ICON, AN ENTREPRENEUR, AND ACTIVIST WHO IS A POWERFUL VOICE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW KILLER MIKE'S DEDICATION AND ADVOCACY IN HIS ART HAVE CREATED MEANINGFUL CHANGE. SOME ARTISTS FIND A FREQUENCY THAT REACHES FAR AND WIDE, WHERE PURPOSE AND SERVICE TO THE GREATER GOOD COME TOGETHER. THERE'S A SENEGALESE PROVERB THAT SAYS, THERE CAN BE NO PEACE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING. KILLER MIKE IS ONE OF THOSE ARTISTS. I'VE HAD TO LEARN SEGREGATIONAL HISTORY. I'VE HAD TO LET MY OWN CURIOSITY TAKE ME OUT OF THAT HISTORY AND FIND MYSELF A FRIEND INSTEAD OF CONFRONT. WITH A CAREER SPANNING TWO DECADES, HE'S ONE HALF OF HIP-HOP DUO RUN THE JEWEL. KILLER MIKE CONTINUES TO EMERGE AS A POWERFUL VOICE THAT RESONATES FAR BEYOND HIS ATLANTA, GEORGIA, ROOTS. WHAT'S THE ONE THING I WANT YOU TO KNOW? HE IS A CHAMPION FOR ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE, AS AN INVESTOR FOR BLACK FINANCE NEO BANK GREENWOOD, ENTREPRENEUR, AND ADVOCATE FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY. HIS PERSPECTIVE IS FIERCELY PROTECTIVE OF HIS COMMUNITY.
