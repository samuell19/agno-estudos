(MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING) Thus all fairy stories end Only an actress would pretend Affairs of state are her latest play Eight shows a week, two matinees My how the worm begins to turn When will the chorus girl ever learn? My how the worm begins to turn When will the chorus girl ever learn? EVITA: (SINGING) The chorus girl hasn't learned the lines You'd like to hear She won't go scrambling over the backs of the poor to be accepted By making donations just large enough To the correct charity She won't be president Of your wonderful societies of philanthropy Even if you asked her to be As you should have asked her to be The actress hasn't learned the lines You'd like to hear She won't join your clubs She won't dance in your halls She won't help the hungry Once a month at your tombolas She'll simply take control As you disappear Forgive my intrusion But fine as those sentiments sound Little has changed for us peasants Down here on the ground l hate to sound childish, ungrateful l don't like to moan But do you now represent anyone's cause but your own? Everything done will be justified By my foundation CHE: And the money kept rolling in from every side Eva's pretty hands reached out And they reached wide Now you may feel it should have been A voluntary cause But that's not the point, my friends When the money keeps rolling in You don't ask how Think of all the people Guaranteed a good time now Eva's called the hungry to her Open up the doors Never been a fund like the Foundation Eva Perón Rolling, rolling, rolling Rolling on in On in Would you like to try a college education? Own your landlord's house? Take the family on vacation? Eva and her blessed fund Can make your dreams come true Here's all you have to do, my friends Write your name and your dream On a card or a pad or a ticket Throw it high in the air And should our lady pick it She will change your way of life For a week or even two Name me anyone Who cares as much as Eva Perón Rolling, rolling, rolling Rolling on out On out CHE: And the money kept rolling out In all directions To the poor, to the weak To the destitute of all complexions Now cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray But that's not the point, my friends When the money keeps rolling out You don't keep books You can tell you've done well By the happy grateful looks Accountants only slow things down Figures get in the way Never been a lady Loved as much as Eva Perón Rolling, rolling, rolling Rolling on out On out Eva! When the money keeps rolling out You don't keep books You can tell you've done well By the happy grateful looks Accountants only slow things down Figures get in the way Never been a lady Loved as much as Eva Perón Rolling, rolling, rolling Rolling on out On out (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (CHEERING) (WOMEN SING IN SPANISH) EVITA: Perón is everything. He is the soul, the nerve, the hope and the reality of the Argentine people. We all know that there is only one man in our movement with his own source of light. We all feed from his light. And that is Perón! (WOMEN CONTINUE SINGING IN SPANISH) (SINGING) And now she wants to be Vice President That was the over-the-top, unacceptable suggestion We didn't approve but we couldn't prevent The games of the wife of the President But to give her pretentions encouragement She's out of her depth And out of the question But on the other hand She's all they have She's a diamond in their dull, gray lives And that's the hardest kind of stone It usually survives And when you think about it Can you recall The last time they loved anyone at all? She's not a bauble you can brush aside She's been out doing What we just talked about Example Gave us back our businesses Got the English out And when you think about it Well, why not do One or two of the things we promised to? But on the other hand She's slowing down She's lost a little of that magic drive But l would not advise Those critics present to derive Any satisfaction from her fading star She's the one who's kept us where we are (DOOR CLOSES) She's the one who's kept you where you are (CHOIR SINGING IN SPANISH) This is not a fashionable nightclub. This is a parliament of free people. We do not come here to dance to the tune of Madame Pompadour! (CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING IN SPANISH) (TIRES SQUEALING) (SHOUTING) (WOMEN SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SHOUTING) (SINGING) Turn a blind eye, Evita Turn a blind eye (CHEERING) CHILDREN: (SINGING) Please, gentle Eva Will you bless a little child? For l love you Tell heaven I’m doing my best I’m praying for you Even though you're already blessed Please, Mother Eva Will you look upon me as your own? Make me special? Be my angel Be my everything, wonderful, perfect and true And I’ll try to be exactly like you Please, Mother Eva (SHOUTING) Will you look upon me as your own? Make me special?

(GROANS) (MURMURING) (SINGING) Why try to govern a country When you can become a saint? (CHATTERING) (CLANGING) (CLANGING CONTINUES) (SINGING) Tell me before l waltz out of your life Before turning my back on the past Forgive my impertinent behavior But how long do you think this pantomime can last? Tell me before l ride off in the sunset There's one thing l never got clear How can you claim you're our savior When those who oppose you are stepped on or cut up Or simply disappear? Tell me before you get onto your bus Before joining the forgotten brigade How can one person like me, say Alter the time-honored Way the game is played? Tell me before you get onto your high horse Just what you expect me to do l don't care what the bourgeoisie say I’m not in business for them But to give all my descamisados A magical moment or two There is evil ever around Fundamental system of government quite incidental So what are my chances of honest advances? l'd say low Better to win by admitting my sin Than to lose with a halo Tell me before l seek worthier pastures And thereby restore self-esteem How can you be so short-sighted To look never further than this week or next week To have no impossible dream? Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines And mark your adieu with three cheers But first tell me who'd be delighted lf l said l'd take on the world's greatest problems From war to pollution, no hope of solution Even if l live for 100 years There is evil ever around Fundamental system of government quite incidental So go if you're able to Somewhere unstable and stay there Whip up your hate in some tottering state But not here, dear Is that clear, dear? Oh, what l'd give for 100 years But the physical interferes Every day more Oh, my creator What is the good Of the strongest heart In a body that's falling apart? A serious flaw l hope you know that (SINGING) Your little body's slowly breaking down You're losing speed You're losing strength, not style That goes on flourishing forever But your eyes, your smile Do not have the sparkle of your fantastic past lf you climb one more mountain It could be your last I’m not that ill Bad moments come, but they go Some days are fine Some a little bit harder But that doesn't mean We should give up our dream Have you ever seen me defeated? Don't you forget what I’ve been through And yet I’m still standing Eva, you are dying. (SINGING) So what happens now? Where am l going to? Don't ask anymore EVITA: (SINGING) Where do we go from here? This isn't where we intended to be We had it all You believed in me l believed in you Certainties disappear What do we do for our dream to survive? How do we keep all our passions alive As we used to do? Deep in my heart I’m concealing Things that I’m longing to say Scared to confess what I’m feeling Frightened you'll slip away You must love me Why are you at my side? How can l be any use to you now? Give me a chance and I’ll let you see how Nothing has changed Deep in my heart I’m concealing Things that I’m longing to say Scared to confess what I’m feeling Frightened you'll slip away You must love me (SINGING) The actress hasn't learned the lines You'd like to hear She's sad for her country Sad to be defeated By her own weak body (CROWD CHANTING) Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita! (CHEERING) Evita! Evita! Evita! (SINGING) I want to tell the people Of Argentina I’ve decided l should decline All the honors and titles You've pressed me to take For I’m contented Let me simply go on As the woman who brings her people To the heart of Perón Don't cry for me, Argentina The truth is l shall not leave you Though it may get harder For you to see me I’m Argentina And always will be Have l said too much? There's nothing more l can think of To say to you But all you have to do Is look at me to know That every word is true (DRUMS PLAYING) (CHOIR SINGING IN LATIN) (MAN SPEAKING IN LATIN) (LATIN CONTINUES) (SINGING) She had her moment She had some style The best show in town was the crowd Outside the Casa Rosada crying, "Eva Perón" But that's all gone now The choice was mine and mine completely l could have any prize that l desired l could burn with the splendor Of the brightest fire Or else... Or else l could choose time Remember, l was very young then And a year was forever and a day So what use Could 50, 60, 70 be? l saw the lights And l was on my way And how l lived How they shone But how soon the lights were gone (SINGING) The choice was yours and no one else's You can cry for a body in despair Hang your head Because she is no longer there To shine, to dazzle or betray How she lived How she shone But how soon the lights were gone CHOIR: (SINGING) Eyes, hair, face, image All must be preserved Still life displayed forever No less than she deserved
