Hey, watch the jacket, Bub. You can kiss that cough goodbye in Uptown, Mrs. Hardison. I'll be so happy. I've suffered such a long, long time. Makes your heart feel good, doesn't it? Hey, this Uptown sounds okay. Maybe I ought to check this out. This Midtown traffic's getting impossible. Got to get the big chief to put a cycle lane in here. Lane? You need a highway, fella. Who taught you how to ride this thing? You almost killed me. You must be Bobby. I'm Rafferty. Hop on, we got some serious talking to do. Dead, what do you mean dead? Mister, you shouldn't be riding a bike. You could really hurt somebody. I haven't lost anybody yet. Come on. Now I suppose everyone else in here is dead, too? As doornails. We're all spirits. Spirits gotta eat, too. Look, kid, hey, what's the last thing you remember? Race. Yeah, I was in a race. It was no contest. The guy chickened out halfway. I kept going. You know, for the crowd. Anyway, I was about to bail out when- Here, try the linguine. Pretty good. What's wrong? You don't like Italian? Emily. Oh, yeah. She was a cute one, all right. Tough break, kid. I got to see her. Sorry, that's impossible. You don't understand, I need to see her! There's something I gotta tell her! Son, you've already told her all you ever will. So this is it? Well, to tell you the truth, I was expecting something different. You know, like angels and harps and that kind of stuff. Oh no, that's in Uptown. Oh, you don't mean I'm- No no no, this is Midtown. Sort of a way-station, just temporary. Oh. So I'll be moving on? It's not that easy, Bob. The big chief doesn't think you're quite ready yet. Which is why he sent me down here. What's the matter, he doesn't like my clothes? Let's just say you have a few strikes against you and until you square yourself to his satisfaction, you're sort of stuck here. So what does he want me to do? Carry out an assignment. Something especially suited to your abilities. Okay, I'm game. When do we start? I was coming to that. You're gonna have to ride the train until we find an assignment for you. What? It's the only way we can keep Midtown from getting overcrowded. Where does it go? Around. Well, how long I gotta stay on this thing? It could be a while. Get me out of here! Open the door! There's a fucking viking in here! Ah Lenny, what are you doing? How many times do I have to tell you? First the lettuce, and then the tomato, and then the onion, huh. What do I gotta do, write it down for you? I'm sorry, I forgot- Look, no sorries, huh? Just get it right! I need six cheeseburgers and seven Cokes, pronto. Two with no tomato, one without onion, two with no mustard, and one with no mayo. And the no-onion wants no ketchup. Oh, and a large fry with extra salt, got it? I hope so. Do you want some help? Melissa, I need you out front. All right. Let me just get this takeout order. Thanks for the offer. Nevermind, get out of here. Please, get out of here. Get out of here. Go out there and help her. I'll handle this. And try not to screw it up. I'm not doing so good, am I? You're doing fine.

Yeah, I remember. Bobby, what do you think of Lenny? He's okay. No, he's better than okay. As a matter of fact, we were getting to be pretty good friends, till he got so damn cocky. Does that surprise you? Yeah, I mean, he even wised off to me. I mean, to me! You know, over the years, he's reminded me a lot of you. But now, more than ever. Emily, what? Lenny is your son. You know, I wished for so long that you could see him. And now you have. Lenny, my son? Mm. I never told him about you, Bobby. What about Joe? He knew. But he still wanted to marry me. I guess I was wrong about Joe. I guess I was wrong about a lot of things. Emily, there's something I never told you. Something I've been wanting to tell you for a long time. I love you. I always have. And I always will. I have to go now, Emily. Don't worry about Lenny. I'll take care of everything. Will I see you again, Bobby? I'll always be with you. He's a good kid. Thanks, Joe. Come on, come on, let's go. Hey, everybody, I got a son! - That's great. - Congratulations! - Way to go. - Thank you. All right! Way to go. Hey, all right! Ah, come on, Rafferty, aren't you gonna congratulate me? I got a kid! Of course, you probably knew that all along. Come on, Rafferty, all I did was step over the bounds a little. Don't you understand, kid? You may appear to no one but your assignment. You broke the rules. They don't like that around here. Well, whatever happens, it was worth it. I mean, to see Emily again, to touch her face, to find out about Lenny. Hey, that'll get me through an eternity. Mm, I need another drink. Need a lift? No. Melissa, wait! Wait! What do you want? Well, I thought maybe we could talk. Why don't you talk to Sharon? Well, she's not much for talking. Can I walk you home? Suit yourself. What's the matter? You don't like me anymore? You used to be somebody I cared about. Now you're acting like someone I never knew. Someone I don't really want to know. Melissa! - Hey! - Whoo! Pull in over there. Come on out. Come on, shorty, come over here. Just leave the car there. Come on. You know what a gut race is, Barnes? Separates guys like me from chicken shits like you. We got the cars and everything set up at the quarry. All you have to do is show up. Now, just between you and me, I don't think you will. But, then again, I happen to think there's nothing but a candyass underneath all those fancy clothes of yours. Come on, let's go. Yeah, that's right, Barnes, go home. That's where you belong. - That's it. - Right. Okay, let's do it. He's gonna do it! - Gallo, okay! - All right! - Hey, all right, nice. - All right, Gallo, huh? - Come on, Gallo. - What do you want? You're on. Hey, let's go! - All right! - All right. Lenny, just let it go. Hey, hop in. I was going to tell you. What does it mean? Gallo challenged him to a race. He accepted. If it's any consolation, he's on the Uptown passenger list. Oh no! Rafferty, you gotta let me go back. There's nothing you can do. You don't understand. My son needs me, Rafferty! Bobby, I know how you feel, but it was meant to be. You can't alter destiny. Destiny, nothing! If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't be in this jam. I got him into this fix! You gotta let me get him out of it! The kid hasn't had a life yet, Rafferty. I didn't know what that meant. But last night I found out what I lost. I don't want that to happen to Lenny. I want him to have a chance to grow old, to have a family. A wife, kids, whatever he wants. All the things I missed out on. Bobby, the consequences. I don't care about the consequences! I'll do anything! Talk to the higher-ups. Talk to whoever you have to. Tell them I'll do anything, anything. Rafferty! Tell them I'd give up my soul. You can back out anytime, Barnes. Lenny, don't do this, please. I've been challenged. My honor's at stake. Your honor's going to get you killed. Don't worry about it. I've got it covered. Charlie! Good luck, Fred. Start them. Yeah! All right! Lenny! No! Shit, shit! You didn't think I'd let you down now, did you? Oh, shit! Lenny! Oh, no! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, it's cursed. No way. I'm sorry. I don't wanna. Somebody try to help him! Hey, look! Will you get your foot out of my face? Oh, my God! Oh, God, Lenny! That was some race. It was the best. It was also the last. You saved my life, again. I'm your guardian angel. That's my job. I see you're with another girl. Yeah, she's really special. I'd like you to meet her. Maybe some other time. Why not now? See that guy down there? I gotta take a ride with him. You're gonna be on your own again. We were just getting to be friends. You're my best friend. Yeah. No matter where I go, we'll always be best friends. You really gotta go? Goodbye, kid. Goodbye. You take care of yourself. You, too. Heck of a kid, ain't he, Rafferty? Yeah, yeah, he's going to be all right. This is hard to say, Rafferty. But I'm gonna miss you. Mmm. Tell me, is it as bad as I think it is, down there? Worse. Thanks. Don't look so glum, Bobby. You're not going down there. You're on your way Uptown. Just earned your ticket. What, could you run that by me again? When you sacrificed yourself for Lenny, you showed us you learned how to love, how to value someone more than yourself. That's how you get a ticket Uptown. What, me, going Uptown? Yep. I'll be damned! Couldn't you put that another way?
