That's what Los Angeles is all about. CARROLL: Daydreams and traffic. Exactly. Can't stand Christmas here, though. It's so feeble. LA's fine in the long run, though.

She's a professional photographer. Shoots corners. Makes sense out of them, too. I love her. She calls me Carl Barber. Never "Carl" or "Mr. Barber" or just, "Hey, there, Carl Barber." [LAUGHS] Like I was some goddamn tombstone or something. What do you think of the cave? Mmm? It's a far cry from that red barn that we started out in, isn't it? Yeah. I liked the barn. You would. You lost your virginity in that barn. [CHUCKLES] I'm leaving. Later. Every woman that I've been with was a virgin. Every woman that's been with me was a whore. I don't think I ever met a man that knew the difference. [CARL LAUGHS] She's something else, isn't she? Hey, you need any money? No, my old man's a millionaire. You're damn right he is. Hell, look around you. Look at these offices. Look at these clothes. I get my hair cut in this goddamn chair by a woman called Grace. Get my nails done. Do you believe that? Jesus.

And before I die, I'd like to have a real lamb chop instead of venison, if that's all right with you. Oh, but those were lamb chops, Kenny.

You ride around in taxi cabs all day long just for me? I got you a housekeeper so that you could spend more time with our son. Now, you're out riding around town all day and he's at home with the housekeeper, and he speaks more Spanish than he does English. And what is that nonsense about the photo album? What is that? Is that supposed to make you something that I'm not? Am I supposed to be ashamed of myself because I made something out of my life? "The sleep of reason produces monsters." Goya said that.

I was left a message to call this number. So? Well, the message was left by my wife. Her name is Karen. She said for me to call her at this number. Do you want to talk to your husband? Hello. Where are you? It doesn't really matter. Damn it, Karen, where are you? Who answered the phone? How long has this been going on, damn it? It doesn't matter who answered the phone. Karen, I want an answer. You and I, it's not working. Are you kidding? And I'm sorry. It's... Karen, you just stop this nonsense and get yourself home. [PHONE HANGS UP] Karen... KAREN: I'm naked now. [PHONE RINGING] Don't answer it. It's probably a wrong number. We know who it is. And you know I've got to answer it. [RINGING CONTINUES] Damn phone. CARROLL: Yeah? Phony. You just did that. Goddamn phony. Well, yes, I know, but I really would like to speak to her again, please. It's for you. Kenny. Karen, now, listen. Don't hang up. Tell me, why have you phoned back? Just don't hang up. I promise I'm not going to get mad again. I'd just like to speak to you. I don't know what there is you can possibly say. Well, I've been looking through that photo album you gave me and... You didn't like that. Well, that's true, I didn't like it when you first... You asked me what did I mean by giving you that. I mean, I thought you'd love it. Well, that's just it. You see, when you first gave it to me, I was really upset by it. Yeah, I know. [STUTTERING] It was kind of like bringing me back to something that I once was and I just didn't want to remember it. But I want you to remember it. And I want us to remember it. Anyway, that's what I wanted. I know it's... Kenny, don't. Stop it. Karen, I really loved that. [SOBBING] Oh, Kenny. Oh, Kenny, you're not without me. I haven't left. I'm coming back. You know I am. Listen. Let's just talk on the phone for awhile. Kenny, answer me one thing. What about the other woman? What other woman? Listen, there's never... There's never going to be any other woman but you. No matter what. Kenny, I don't know. You're not going to change. I mean, I'm always talking about changes, but you're not going to change because people don't change. People do change. No, they don't. Nothing ever changes here, not even the weather. No, people do change. Love you, Kenny. Kenny. Don't cry when I say I love you. I don't know. [CHUCKLING] You silly old thing. Hey, you should be smiling. Are you smiling? Yeah. [STUTTERING] I love you, too. Is that it? What time are you going to come back? Oh, I can't tell you that. Well, I know I'm going to try and make things different. I mean, I know I haven't been paying the kind of attention to you than I should've been. But if I was more involved in the things that you liked being involved in... I'll go and see Camille again. It's not playing anymore. Kenny, about your promotion. Carroll, you were right. I was with him all day, and all he did was look at himself in the mirror and fluff his hair and talk about himself. It was awful. Oh, that's a pretty sweater. Thanks. Where you going? Out. You like hats? Yeah. Do you like keys? Yeah. See you. Bye. Hey, Kenny, listen. Oh, excuse me. I'm Linda. This is my house. Listen, Kenny. I'm going to make you one big promise, one enormous promise. I'm just going to get my Christmas packages. I'll be out of your way. The next time we see each other... If you need anything, just holler, I'll be in my room. I may never cook those horrible wild animals like venison and wild boar. I mean, I'll just give you... Mmm... Lamb chops. Plain old lamb chops. Okay? And listen. I promise never to... No, maybe you could promise to listen to me cough? KEN: Listen. I want you to understand something. I believe that you and I can go beyond your normal male and female relationship. KAREN: Oh, Kenny. And we could go and live in the country. Well, I... Just the family. Oh, it'd be so lovely. It will be so lovely. Hello? Hello, Karen? Karen? Kenny? It'd be so lovely in the country. It'd be beautiful in the country. [GASPING] Scrub pads. [GASPING] I just had the most lovely conversation with my husband. He's giving up his job. We're going to go live in the country for my health. What's the matter? I don't think I have very long to live. You don't? I'm dying. My cousin died once. My husband is looking for a chateau. I've always wanted to see the inside of a real chateau. Now I will. What's a chateau? A castle. Oh. What's your name? Linda. What's yours? Marguerite. Mine's really Virginia. Your real name's Virginia? A lovely name. Virginia, the sleep of reason produces monsters. [TAPE FAST-FORWARDING] Couldn't stay away, huh, writer? Where's the artist? The writer wishes to speak to the artist. He's gone.Huh? Where'd he go? This is a strange town. Eric did not like it. He's not going to finish the album. It's okay. You'll get your money. I like LA. Yeah.
