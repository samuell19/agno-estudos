(ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) See, this is the ultimate difference between us. This, it's how much we can walk outside. Looks like you're not totally brain-damaged. But they are different. Why? Before getting here I never thought a tree could be so precious. Now I look at this tree every day, and it makes me so sad. It's so close. Yet I can't reach it. I can't even sit under it. It's fucking pathetic. - Just tell me. - Tell you what? We all have to die. Why would I kill you? Enjoy every breath you take, it could be your last. Later. - (ELECTRONIC HUMMING) - Hey. (WHOOSHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SIGHING) (RUSTLING) (CLANGING) (SIGHING) I was the same before getting here. You get use to it. It's gone bad. Look, if you don't eat you starve. Is there wine? I'll get you some. Christine. Do we really have to kill each other? Didn't you lose your memory? But it is on TV, every time one of... Just eat your food.

Christine? Christine. (DOOR SQUEAKING) (SIGHING) TV: Hello, Chi, welcome to the game 108 Lives. TV: The rules will only be explained once, so please listen carefully. In 108 Lives the only escape is to destroy others. If you can kill the remaining two players in the current world within an hour, you will successfully enter the next world, achieving reincarnation. The two who failed will be forever trapped and surrounded by eternal darkness. If only one player is killed in this hour, then the winner who escapes from the previous world - replaces the dead player... - Hey! TV: Achieving reincarnation. TV: The game cycles between different levels of worlds, with infinite roles, infinite slaughter, leading to infinite procession of the game. TV: The only way to escape to reality is kill 108 people. Hey, hey. TV: No point of changing the channel, Chi. This is your fate, accept it. TV: Another thing, you can only use your cell phone to receive information from the Upper World, or call the Lower World. TV: Any attempt to contact the external reality is worthless. CHI: Hey. TV: Also, if you ever feel bored, you can always sit in front of the TV, and watch your own killing show in the previous world. (PANTING) The game shall start in 10 seconds. Good luck, Chi. TV: 10, nine, eight, seven, - Hey, hey! - Eight, seven. Six, five, four. (GASPING) Three, two, one. (SCREAMING) (GROANING) This means... (THUDDING ON WINDOW) Christine! Christine.

(GUN FIRING) (SPEAKING IN REVERSE AND SPED UP) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) Okay, from now we stop killing each other. Am I clear? (SCOFFING) Do you really want to keep going like this? There is no other option, Chi. Why not? We don't know, we never tried. There's only one meal worth of food in the fridge you idiot. You don't wanna kill nobody? That's your problem, but I'm not gonna starve to death here. So we'll kill for a bit of food? We are not fucking animals. - Chi! - Oh yeah, I wish. Let's bet. I'll bet you even if we starve Christine and I wouldn't kill each other. (CHUCKLING) Don't make me lose. Thank you. Sorry, I forgot. Open. Open. (DISHES RATTLING) Okay, whatever. See? Not poisoned. I'll eat it if you don't. (COUGHING) - You... - I didn't. Who else? Stop! (COUGHING) (GASPING) You thought about killing me just now, didn't you? (LAUGHING) It was a mistake. (CRACKING) (THUDDING) Christine. You don't have to explain anything. Christine, I would never hurt you. But I will, sorry.

(SOBBING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 52, 53, 54, 55. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) This is the farthest I can go. Don't worry. CHRISTINE: I'll never reached that stupid tree. CHI: It's just a tree, why do you care so much? I used to have one just like that in my backyard when I was growing up. It means a lot to me. Those are good memories, pure and happy. Let's go. Wait. What's wrong? What is it? (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) We're going to your childhood. You're a genius. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Be careful, one foot down, you'll disappear. (GROANING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) So pretty. Who gave it to you? Don't remember. It feels so close to me. That kind of jewelry would look better on a woman. - Put your neck out. - No, that's not what I meant. Quickly. So? It's very nice. You know, I didn't mean what I said earlier. (WIND HOWLING) Christine. Yeah? Time to go back. (GROANING) (PANTING) (KNOCKING ON GLASS) - Chi. - What? We lost Reino. Shit. Here.

What are you doing, what is this, what's this? Shit. Tell me man, what are you doing? No, no. (GROANING) No. Thank you. What is this? This? I know, try. You're not hungry? Not hungry. So what's happening here anyway? And why does this bitch want to kill us? Did you try watching TV after you got here? What TV? You like her, huh? I knew it. (GUN COCKING) Oh, she's here. So what did you mean the other day when you spoke to me? Did you fall in love with me in another dimension? (BANGING ON TABLE) Oh my god. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Your turn.

(RUMBLING) TV: You now have five minutes to kill each other. Otherwise, you will die and be sent to another dimension. What? I believed you. Believe me, Christine. Come on, fucker. (YELLING) - (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) - Chi! (SCREAMING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) MASK: You have finally gathered the courage to confront me. You cowards. Let us out. MASK: The three of you are such a disappointment. What's happening, Chi? MASK: Chi, I order you to immediately complete your level and finish the game. MASK: Okay, then, I will finish it for you.
