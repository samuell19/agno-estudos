Divine carcass "No, no, a work of art is not for the child generations." "It is offered to the countless numbers of the dead." "Who approve it. Or refuse it." - Jean Genet. - Yes? - I want to know to price of the truck. I can get ten million for it. Look at the motor. Look at the state of the motor. Look at the state of the motor. It needs a lot of work! No, there's no... Don't do that to me! If you're ready to pay, we can work something out, no problem! - We are going to Niger with it. - It's more than our budget. I can give you a good price. I'm sure we can find an agreement. I will drop the price for you. I'll let it go for eight million. It's still too expensive. I'll see if my client can pay more. No, eight million, eight million. It's my last price. Take it or leave it. - And the car? - The car isn't for sale. It's for the European. No, that car is not for sale. It's not. But it's a car I really like. No, it's not for sale. It's for the European. - Can't you talk to him? Talk to him. - No, no I can't. Try pumping the gas two or three times to see. I put in a new battery. Have a nice trip! What a car! No problem on the road? Look at the upholstery. Luckily, we saw it running, or we wouldn't believe it. - And the horn works! - Two-tone, like the English cars. The 403 had a habit of splitting in two. Maybe there's no motor in there. We don't know. Yes, that's it! So wait, there must be a... - He's good with his hands. - I crossed the desert! - What a fright! - Oh! It works! The battery... - Simon will really score with that. - He's going to show off! - Peugeot, a car for Africa. - I used to get sick in this car. - How about you? - For me it was the 504. I'm motion sick, so my parents used to pull over so I could puke. The radiator is a bit tired. Actually, I like it when it breaks down once in a while. Well, with this one you won't be disappointed. - No problem. - No, I like it. Otherwise... Is that why you bought it? - For the human contact? - Right. The little garage mechanics you'll meet on the road. No, otherwise, it's just a machine... Yes, It's... it's better than a new car. Give me the key. I'd like to drive it. Is that the key? No. It's not that one. I don't want to criticize, but the front wheel... Riding alone in my Automobile the air conditioning works for real The seat belts were thrown into the deal From now on wherever I go My life's on credit and in stereo... Thierry, are you sure you can drive the car? The engine stalled! - What's happening? - Breaking down already? - I must have used to fourth speed. - Yes. What year did you learn to drive? There was a weird sound when it stopped. They have adopted the car. - Here we are. - Here we are. - Here we are. - Well, then... Nice trip! It was a conclusive test. Nice car! Simon, at least it's pretty! It won't work, it's a power supply issue. - Let's try! - Let's try. - Go ahead. - Let's try. - Why don't you go out? - I thought the door was locked. I can't open the door. Stay here. Stay here. - Good, I'll guide you. - Right. I must say pushing is not my favorite thing. - Very good! - Faster! Faster! Put some effort into it! Put some effort into it! Come on! Your turn now. Nice shot! - Well done. - I couldn't do it again. It's your turn again. - Me? Again? Where is the white ball? - The white ball is here. - Play for me, please. - I can't play! Come, here. Play for me. Take the white one and put it here. - Stay by my side. - You have to guide her. Guide her. Yes, like this. I had drawn on the sand Her sweet face smiling to me Then it rained on that beach And in the storm, she vanished And I cried, I cried "Aline!" so she might return And I wept, I wept Oh, how I ached I sat beside her soul but the lovely figure had fled I searched for her in vain And without a single hope to guide me And I cried, I cried "Aline!" so she might return And I wept, I wept Oh, how I ached Lesson for February 5. Plato divided the world into two. The world of the senses, where all is ephemeral. And the world of eternal ideas. Knowledge of the world of ideas: One must imagine men, prisoners deep in a cave, sitting with their backs to the light, and condemned to seeing nothing but the wall before them. The prisoners can only see... The prisoners can only see... Imprecise shadows of real things thrown onto the wall. The world is nothing but frivolity and brief apparitions. One has to imagine that one of these men is forced to move his head to look up at the sunlight. His eyes will be so dazzled that he won't see anything. - Joseph! - Yes, sir. - Is everything fine? - Yes, fine. What are you cooking? Some salad, rice, and a bit of beefsteak. Sounds good. My car broke down again. - Again, today? - Yes. You'll just have to change garage mechanics. It never used to break down before. That proves the garage mechanic isn't up to scratch. - You think so? - Yes. I can suggest... I know a mechanic not far from my house. - Joseph! - Yes. Look. What is it? Where did you find that? Inside the car. - Really? - Yes. But what does that mean? I wonder, what it means... It's a bad sign. It means someone wishes you ill. Who? Could it be someone at work? Joseph... It wouldn't be you who put it in the car? - Me? - Yes. Tell the truth. I couldn't do such a thing! - And why would I do it, sir? - I don't know. Do you want my car? - Your car? - Yes. I'm not rich. How would I keep it up? Anyway, I'm sick of that car. If you want it, it's yours. - The car? - There. It's yours. Okay? The screwdriver! The pliers! - Can we turn it on? - We can try. Get started! Start the engine. Start the engine! Start the engine! - Hello. - Welcome home. - Hello. - Hello. - How did it go? - Everything went fine. Is that the car? It still works well, doesn't it? Do you know what they call a car like this in France? - An ancestor! - An ancestor! Can you call a car an ancestor? - That's what the French call it. - We can't call it that. Here, we have our own ancestors who protect and guide us. It can't be our protecting god. It's nothing but an old car! Yes. Still, it's in good shape. See how it bore me from afar. You can't call a living object an ancestor. - Still, it's nice. - It's pretty. It's a good car. It made it all the way here without any problem. - There is a rear view mirror. - Is there climate control? We will have to go by little groups. That's enough, that's enough! Joseph. You will be blessed. This car won't cause any troubles, or sickness or death. Your ancestors will open the doors to a better life. So be it! Look at this car. This is a good thing. I am delighted about it! God will help him to keep it well. And his work will evolve well. You will never let me walk the road. This car will bring you happiness. Soon, you'll be back by plane! When a mother says a prayer for her son, it always works. The car will drive us and bring us back. It's certain. With the volunteers, I understood. We must remain under their orders and enjoy them, gently, until death. You know, I have something in mind. Don't think the car is only for our amusement. We'll use it to make money. Lots of money. Don't worry. Wait till you see the results. I don't see why you had to show the car off to the entire village. People will only grow jealous, and take it out on us. Don't worry. They would have known no matter what. Better they know from me. If somebody else had told them they could have taken it very badly. Then we would have something to fear from them. You saw how pleased they were. That proves they won't harm us. They were pleased, but not sincere. You never know what they'll do once our backs are turned. Ancestors, I invoke you. I summon your power! I invoke you all, and forget no one. Those from all the regions from which we migrated: Ouaga, Sosome, Keita... You, ancestor of Joseph! I ask you to welcome Joseph and the asset he brings the family, and that you take care of this asset. His boss entrusted the car not to him, but to you. Help him preserve it. This is not a car that will deteriorate or cause accidents. We will use it to bring profit to our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, friends, relatives and allies. Everyone will say: "Ho!" He who received a car from his boss did well to come and show it. Some hope there is trouble with the car. You must bar the way to these troubles! We don't know who wishes Joseph ill. Only you can know who they are. See that justice is done! May Joseph's boss be well! May he not forget Joseph. May Joseph not forget his boss. So that later, Joseph may bring the family something even better. Ancestor! You know we are only intermediaries. I throw these colas. Tell us how things are. God be praised! - Where are you going? - To Ouidah. - You know it's 600 francs? - No, it's 400 francs. It's 600 francs. Gas is expensive now. They always take us for 400. It never occurs to you that I must buy replacement parts? No, no, it wasn't on the radio. - Oh, they said 400 on the radio. - Yes, to go to Ouidah, it's 400 francs. And the radio buys new parts? - Give me 500, and I'll take you. - No, I only have 400 francs. That's your problem. If you don't like it, I'll get out. - Oh, you want to get out? - Yes. - Alright, stay put. I'll take you. - Good. Okay. Hurry up, hurry up. Okay, driver... - How much? - 15,000 francs. Be nice. I'll give you 5,000. Do you think I bought a car to be paid so badly? Come back Wednesday. There will be another load. Wednesday? Thief! Give me my money! Trains, planes, boats, are means... of communication. Let me see now. Trains. Why do you come here? To learn how to read and speak French. - Learn how to read. - Learn how to read and write. That's why you are here, and that's what we'll do today. Be attentive, I'll start reading. We want to do some business. That is why we learn to read and to write. We have the project to assemble ourselves so as to make soaps and sell them at the market. Reading. We want to do some business. The is a period. Reading. We want to do some business. - Did she read well? - Yes! We're going to open a notebook to write the word onion. We are going to open a notebook to write the word salad. Our learning is progressing. We can read and write P.A.D.E.B. forward! It's not that hard, you have to learn to read and write. You're already here? Your thing, it takes time. I can't leave until it's over. There you are, we warned you! Instead of spending your money on useful things, you're wasting it. What's the matter? Before, you walked. Now I'm taking you in the car and you get mad! Come home by foot! - Whose is that old car? - Fidèle's husband's. Is it out of order? Where are we going to push? From behind or in front? Don't take ghosts lightly You have to take them seriously... Joseph! Yes, father. And you, my mouthpiece! Tell those here... not to be surprised at my presence today. I will tell them why I have come. You see that child there? If he touches a tree, it falls. If he takes a rope in hand, it breaks. If he tries to go forward, it's no good. If he tries to go backward, it's no good. He has had so much bad luck, he finally even remembered me, chief of ghosts. This situation troubles him. There is no way out. If his troubles are so many, it's because I was angry when I saw he no longer paid me any attention. Remember when our ancestors brought us into the world You, my followers, cry hurray! Joseph, your mother brought you into the world And we will give you the force to live in it... Hello, sir. So, have you come back to work? Yes sir. What happened? I had problems, Sir, with the car. The last time I caused an accident. When I went to see the diviner, he said I was having problems with an ancestor. This ancestor was my maternal uncle. Is that so? After his death, I saw him everywhere. At night, in the street... it's as if he didn't want to go. Really? You know my mother died two years ago. And... I never visited her grave because... I have the feeling that if I go she will be truly dead. As long as I think about her, she is not dead... Not entirely. But my daughter won't think about it any more... and that will be that. It's like that with us. Generation after generation. We disappear into oblivion. You see, it's easier for you. Our ancestors don't come back. In my case, the diviner advised a ghost ceremony. And that's what I did for the three days I was absent. And does the car work now? It's still in the garage, with the mechanic. Even if it isn't fixed yet... I am at peace. That's what I wanted. Push, push, push! Okay! Enough. Hammer. - God will give you happiness. - So be it! - Joy will enter the house. - So be it! When we break the cola nut, we will find a sweet almond inside. Ancestor! We are children. We don't know anything. Don't create problems for us! Here are our colas, speak! - They fell on the right side. - Ogun! Sing a song! Ogun, come and make happiness! Welcome! - Hello. How are things? - Good. We have come to see if the thing we ordered has been completed. No problem. Come sit down and have a drink. If it's not finished, you'd better watch out! Come sit down. Where is the divinity? Before I take it out, we must do something important. "If we don't strike the ground, we can kill no serpent." Does that mean we must bring out the ritual drinks? Bring out the alcohol glass. Serve me some, quickly. Close it. Here are your gifts. And the divinity? We will bring it out. You'll see. Moussa, bring the divinity! - Can we get closer? - Of course. Hey! My great master! It's beautiful, well done. Not a fault. - How do you like it? - It is good. Beautiful work. He who wants a good night Must make offerings unto the divinity... Come, listen, the divinity will speak... Come, listen, the divinity will speak! Come, the divinity will speak! Come, the divinity will speak We have arrived We are invincible... Welcome Agbo, king of the masters of the night... Accept this iron ram A new Agbo is there We accept it We accept his eyes We accept his nose We accept his mouth We accept his ears! We accept his head We were brought a new Agbo and we accept it He is beautiful He is strong His horns, his horns Agbo is here Better not run into him... The divinities protect us We must remain faithful to them... Subtitles by hywel, hobsbaum and tadanobu
