-What are you doing in here? -Nothing. -I'm ready. -Ok. Siss, listen now. He tends to start at 15:35. He switches between three routes. One long and two short. One short one, around the transformer, takes him about 25 minutes. On the other short one he misses the transformer and does 2 laps of the park. The longest of the routes go up past the church. -It takes approx. an hour. -Do I have to swallow this now? Yes, any time. I'll go up to the place where Lars lives. We'll fix this mess, Siss, We'll fix it. -Communication check. -And that means? The phone works. Where are you now? On the playground. What do I do now, then? -We wait. -But I'm cold. Try jogging a bit. The subject is on his way out. Wait for route selection. Subject is on the long route. Requesting confirmation. -Between the blocks? -Yes. -Hello. -Yes, hello. Oh... It's... flowers for you. -Ok, there you go. -Thank you. -Now, what? -Go to the bench. Pretend to stretch out. But do it quickly. -Hi. -I didn't know you jogged. -Oh, well... -So, smile then. -One has to keep in shape. -Have you been far? -No, not far really... What about you? Where've you been...? -I have a fixed course I'm running. -Where? Svartvann and back. I can't take going to a gym. -Me neither. Do you run every day? -As often as I can, really. Hello! The solution was 4.3. Do you think it was hard? -Not for you, then. -It took me half an hour. -What about tomorrow? -How about the camera? I'll borrow my brother's. I haven't seen you at school lately. -I'll call you back. -Okay! Vibeke said something about you having been in hospital. Yes, it was Vibeke who said it. The shoes! Ask if they're new. Eh... Nice shoes! Are they new? These? No! But... are yours? No, I... I mean, they're... -Ask what he's doing this weekend. -What are you doing? Eh... That is... -Try! -What are you doing... this weekend? Are you...? Are you going to...? Are you... in...? What he'sâ€¦ Are you up to... this weekend? -Dad? -No! It's you, isn't it? It's me! Siss! Is it you, then? Yes, but... I hear you! -Who are you talking to, then? -It's been 12 years. What's going on... Thomas! Dad's alive! I didn't do anything. I was just standing here, and then... -I heard Dad's voice! -It's not. He's alive! Do you hear me? Let go! What are you doing? I can't be admitted now! Don't do it! Let me go! I won't go back there! -Here's your bag. Be a good girl now. -No, please! I love you, Siss. Be good, then. Nothing. -She was jogging? -Yes! Why? I thought it might be a good way to get to know Lars. -She said she heard his voice. -Yes. -What happened? -You already know, Thomas. Can't you tell me again? Please. You'd just been born. -And Siss was five. -Yes, and we were on vacation. We never got very far. No! For not long after, Moss swerved the car off the road. You were found on the same day by an elderly couple on a walk. All they heard was a little baby crying. -It was just Siss and you... -Who survived. Yes! Mummy was dead when they found her. And daddy died in the hospital. Yes! Be careful! I thought you guys were proffesionals. What are you staring at? -Haven't you seen a girl before? -Of course! -Do you live here? -Yes! It's really ugly here. I wouldn't move here. And the hallway stinks! -Where are you going? -To school. Shall we go together? Wait, then! Just don't start thinking we're friends because of this. -What are you listening to? -Some Australian stuff. Ugh! I hate Australia. Ok! It's only a short while. Damn, I wouldn't want to stay here the rest of my life. If I were you, I would've run away long ago. Give me an rundown of the most popular boys. I don't know. You don't have to be gay for that. Just say who all the girls dream about. -There's Gary and... -No, not like that. I don't want anyone to think we know each other. -What about the girls? -Well, Anette and gang. The girl gang over there. -Tell! -What? Do they smoke? Are they good at school? What do their parents do? Are they spoiled? -Anette plays handball. -Okay! What else? -Her parents are divorced. -Forget it! See you... maybe. But don't count on it. Hi! I can be your friend. But I can't stand any of that girl talk about periods. Hello! I'm talking to you! Okay, then. Can I hang out with you? Please! -Why? -I'm ten times as cool as you. -What? -Nothing. Just need to adjust my strategy a bit. My name's Monica. And you? -Thomas. -Just that? -Thomas Pedersen. -Is that what the P is on your backpack? Cool jacket, by the way. Promising. So she sat by the window. And then she said: "There's a draft here." So when she moved. The others just stared. She moved next to Arne. -Oh! In love? -What? With who, then? -The new girl! - Oh, please! -Sure? -Yes! Neither am I. I'm done with girls. -You're done with girls? -Yes! -You've never started. -You neither. That was great fun. Do you know why girls don't care about us? We're so incredibly childish. -Was it good? -Yeah, I think so. Come on, let's check! How long is your sister in hospital for, then? Until she's better. -What's happened? -You've been asleep. -They say you need to relax. -Who's "they"? The doctors. He was here last night. Who was? Dad. -I heard his voice, Thomas. -Siss. You've always heard voices. Not his voice before. I heard it quite clearly. Siss. Thomas. It's not me he wants to talk to. It's you. You're not listening. I'm trying to talk to him, but he says your name over and over again. -He says Thomas! -Siss! I hear him clearly. It's like he's here in the room. I check if he's here, but it's only his voice. -Siss, he's dead! -No! -Just ask Lisbeth and Erling. -They don't know anything about this. We came to them long afterwards. They have no idea. It's just because you're sick. Don't you see? Look here! A phone number. I heard the numbers. -It's not. -Thomas, I heard the numbers. -Ask how we should meet him. -He's dead. Tell him I miss him. Thomas! You mustn't tell anyone, ok? He said it many times. We mustn't tell anyone. You got that? -Yeah -Ok. Go now! Lisbeth! Erling! Hello! It's Frank. I am not available right now. -Dad? -Leave a message and I'll call back. Subtitles by Oliver Sanderson
