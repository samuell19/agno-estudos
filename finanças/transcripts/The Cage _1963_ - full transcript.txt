- Dr. Ombous? - Yes. Pleasant trip? Yes, thank you. - Are you looking for something? - Someone. Returning from abroad, you expect a crowd to greet you ... ... but the President? That's a bit much! He's not here for you! He's going to France to see ... you know who! - Is that all you've brought from Paris? - The rest is up here. And the best. I'll take you to the hospital. Dr. Carruel expects you. Come in. There you are! Long trip? - Not bad. 20 minutes by car, 6 hours by plane, 12 years of study. - Tell me about Paris. - Which one? There are so many! Mine was the Boul' Mich' and the Latin Quarter. Who were your professors? Bourrel at La Pitié Hospital, Albeaux-Fernest at Laennec. Excellent. Here, you'll see, we have our work cut out for us. First, you should take a tour of the place. And I thought you could have no better guide than ... Come in, my dear. Oyane! Recognize me? You didn't forget? Forget? I expected you at the airport! I was furious not to see you there. - Really? But I was on duty. You must have lots to say to each other. Show him around. - All ready. - Very well. - Well, here we are. - Yes, here we are. - How are you? - Well, and you? - Well. I have something to tell you, Philippe. Yes? So do I. - You go first. - No, you. Getting engaged as children -- that's an old custom. But that's done with. Fine for the old days, but not now. Of course, Oyane. It doesn't bind us. You're free to choose whom you like. You too, Philippe. That's what I wanted to say. Thank you. That doesn't mean we can't get married later. We need to get to know each other. My idea exactly. And if we don't get along ... - That's that! - We'll forget it. - And just be good friends. - No one's going to marry you by force. - The idea -- in the 20th century! In any event, I didn't forget you. I brought you a gift. - Really? What is it? - Guess. Philippe, it's a ring. Like a marriage ring. Of course it is, silly. I have no time to lose. This afternoon, let's see your parents and make the arrangements. But my parents are old-fashioned -- the bride-price! - Is it high? - Of course. I'm valuable! They've already been offered a buffalo and three pigs. And they turned all that down? Amazing! Come along -- I don't know if we'll have enough money. - Shall we buy him a bicycle? - Yes, he's always wanted one. How about this one? Hey, boss! Coming. - How much is this bike? - 10,400. - Here. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! Coming with us? We've got to find Charles, he'll be right back. Hello, Christiane. Where's Charles? - Ready? - Sure. - Where's my goat? - Christiane's got it. - Is this the goat? - Like it? You two are very kind. Mama will be very happy. Let's go! Where's Benoît? - Ready? - Yes! Marcel! Frédéric! Let's go! - Well, my friend, feeling better? - Yes, doctor. Continue the sulfa treatment every three hours. - And how are you? - Much fever, doctor. 38.5. I had 50, once, and you see I'm none the worse. So, not too disoriented? Oh, no. It's the same routine as in Paris. Here in Libreville, yes. In the bush, it's another story. You'd be dealing with sorcery, superstition, witch doctors. Which reminds me, Lefranc leaves at 4:00 for a vaccination tour. Make sure he has all his material -- last time half was left behind. Chief, why don't I do that tour? Might as well dive in. You know the Monts de Cristal region is the roughest in Gabon. I know. Would you object to my insisting? A monthlong tour for a newlywed -- - Never mind that. - Thank you, Oyane. You're a wonderful wife. All right then! If you hadn't insisted, I would have thought less of you. The Monts de Cristal area is all this. Green hell. Now we're in Rispal's territory. Rispal? - The logger -- a strange guy. - How so? He's almost a god to his workers. Great -- he can help me. - Don't count on it. - Why not? Ever known a white witch doctor to help a medical doctor? A white witch doctor? Are you kidding? - Hi, Cauchet! - Hi, Colette! - No mail? - Not today. - Where's the doc? - That's me. Hello! Welcome! I'm Colette. Thanks! I'm Philippe. - Vaccinating? - Yes, smallpox. Go find my husband. I'll show you your quarters. You know where yours are. See you. You must know you're wasting your time. Here Pasteur is like snow -- absolutely unknown! You can always vaccinate me -- so your trip won't be for nothing. I do it every visit to make the doctors happy. - Thanks, you'll be a good example. - Don't get your hopes up! Here you go. I hope it suits. I'm sorry, it's all I can offer you. In the bush, we take what we can get. Necessities are luxuries to us! - Don't worry, this will be fine. I put your nurse up there -- ah, here's my husband. - Hello, Mr. Rispal. - No, I'm just his foreman. Mr. Rispal is already on site. - Where's that? - 25 km from here. Over bumpy roads. - We'll go by helicopter. The boss hates interruptions at work. But since you're set on it, let's go. - Dieudonné, quick, help me. - Yes, boss! Over here. My bag, quick. That's serious. - What do you want? - I'm a doctor. No way. Yes, he's come from Libreville to do vaccinations. What's that to me? That wound needs to be drained and sutured! Unfortunately, we don't often get doctors here. So we make do. And we get along just fine. Come on. Get up. Tomorrow you'll be healed. Help him. And the best part is, he will be. Are you from here? Where did you study medicine? Paris. You didn't need to go so far. The herbs of your country -- just stoop and pick them. But you have to know how to choose them. A bad beginning! But he's a good guy. He just doesn't like foreigners. - Who's the foreigner here, he or I? With that attitude, you won't get much from him. I don't want anything from him. You can keep your Rispal! And I don't want anything to do with him! You won't feel a thing, just a tiny pinch. See? Right over here. Don't be afraid, old boy -- you're not a weakling, are you? Hey kids! Here we go! You'll see -- nothing to it! Romuald, his name is. Right, with a "d," lives in the next village. Well? What's the point of my wasting my time? We're not here to vaccinate by force, Alain. Then you won't vaccinate many people. Too bad. It'll be everyone or no one. Doc, give me two strong men and I'll have them all lined up for you. - You did tell them? - They've been told, all right. But, in their language, "vaccination" and "sting" are the same. Mtumbo. - So, do I go to it? - No. Where's your Rispal's house? - 20 km through the brush. Hey! Institut Pasteur! Don't break your neck. Sit down. Justine! Another glass. - What's that? - House blend. Mr. Rispal ... I'm here because I need you. No one came to be vaccinated. You're the only one who can help me. - Why should I help you? - Because you love this country. Because you know as well as I the terrible conditions here. And the right of every citizen -- - Oh, I've heard this before. I've known guys like you. With your mania for peddling second-hand ideals ... ... to people who'd be happier without them. And I knew a guy like you in the Latin Quarter. A bigmouth who acted cynical to hide that he was more intelligent ... ... or more sensitive than others. Maybe he was ashamed of it. But that didn't keep us from becoming great friends. How did you tame him? If I hide out here, it's to avoid hearing such trash. Now, if you need a small favor ... Yes, I'd appreciate it. Tomorrow I'll take you to a bouiti. - But that's witchcraft! - Don't talk about what you don't know. Do you want to vaccinate, yes or no? I don't see what -- Yes or no? Well ... all right. It's funny ... I feel as though you're the black man and I'm the white. Tomorrow at 7:00, all right? Without fail! Well, we're stuck. What a wretched road. It's the only way to the village where the bouiti is held. - Have you heard of Mamy Watta? - A little. The legendary white woman with long hair whose spell drives men mad? Mad with love. To think people still believe such nonsense! Help me -- get out. - What a laugh. - We must hurry. Fine. Take this. Wait here for me. If your foreign friend can vaccinate the villagers ... ... against Mamy Watta's spells ... ... we agree. If they keep tonight's word, you'll be turning vaccinees away. That's wonderful. Then do as I say. Follow me. Here. This will help you last the night. Tell me ... do you really think it's necessary to attend this thing? It's little enough to ask. What did you tell them? That your vaccine would protect them from Mamy Watta. Clearly, I've got a lot to learn! More than you think. Look at me. All right? There you go! How are you? I'm fine, but my husband's sick. Always thinking of Mamy Watta. You must vaccinate him. - What's your name? - Ronmald, Kombilé. - And yours? - Accré, Georgette. Next! - Name? - Miana, Pauline. Very good. - And your name? - Sosa, Sivamego. You had a different name yesterday! - Pango, Daniel. - Why did you change it? My wife didn't like it. More fun for the census people. Go on. - And your name? - It's still Koumba. Colette? This home trip, Let's visit the Lecointres. - At Pontarlier? - For trout fishing. What lure should I use? 1 or 5? You don't think small, do you? Pardon me. You're having fun. - Where's the doc? - Haven't seen him. I'll get him. What can he want from him? Well, I'm going to use a 16 ... He's dying! Something must be done! This is just the sort of place where Mamy Watta appears. Really, at your age ... ... you still believe these fairytales? - Say ... ... the man at the bouiti -- you thought he was dead, right? Well, then! Let's change the subject. You know how few people have been inside this house? I do. Perhaps that means we'll be friends. Perhaps. Would you like a drink? Who is this? My wife. You're married? Yes. Does she live in the city? No, here. Shall I introduce you? I'm sure she'll like you. Right, Isabelle? Isabelle, meet Philippe, M.D. Bad luck -- Madame isn't receiving today. She's more hospitable when I let her take the shape of a woman. Rather a tasteless joke. You're an unbeliever. Either you're making fun of me ... ... or you're really crazy. Which is worse. There's a third possibility -- the right one. - What's that? - That it's true. All right. The mouse is your wife and the monkey your reflection -- yes? And why not? There are things not learned in books. They changed you, in Europe. They taught me to think and see clearly. They dispelled the mists still clouding Africa -- -- which you seem to enjoy. They suit me. That's not true. And you have no right. No one has the right. - We're free -- it's a republic. It's not a question of freedom ... ... but of humanity! Yes, big words, big theories ... You call those big words? Hospital, university, airport, television? For me they're realities -- necessities! It's criminal to stagnate when the world's on the move! Every day progress is made in every field! Interesting. Go on. It's a duty to build a modern country -- to live in today's world! If you don't go forward, you go back! - Nonsense. Maddening nonsense. Can't anyone live in peace any more? Live in indifference and torpor? You mean like me? Just look around you! At least I'm not bothering anyone ... Pardon me. I have work to do. Won't you say goodbye to Isabelle? Goodbye, Isabelle! You know, in Europe you'd be a hit on the halls! Was that you singing last night? - Where? - By the mangroves. No ... I was here, I had work to do. And if I'd sung, it would be raining today! Sit down now ... good! Ooh, chilly! Right? - Hey, doc! Are you coming or not? - Let's go! No! Get down here! Look, I'll show you. Look. Got that? They just need to be shown ... - When shall I pick you up? - 6:00. I should be done by then. - Hello, chief, how are you? - Fine, thanks. Coming by our place tonight? We'll give you an African meal. Manioc, smoked shark, snakemeat en brochette! Sorry, Alain, I can't. Steak and fries? No, Alain, I'm busy this evening. Busy? Is that what you call it? You're only young once! - Bye. Well, we'll start with this little one ... Let's see those teeth ... There ... open wide ... Michel! He will come back. Not long now. If you are thirsty, drink. Oh! I burned myself. Is it serious, doctor? Phantoms don't burn, do they? But I'm not a phantom. I'm quite alive. Delighted to hear it. But ... why is no one in the village aware of you? Does he keep you shut away? Oh, yes ... the cage! Come back, Michel -- you've had your joke! Where is he hiding? - Do we really want him back? I don't often get the chance to talk to people ... ... and I'm awfully chatty! Michel and I ran out of conversation long ago. Well, now you'll have an ideal conversation starter. "Remember how we pranked that Libreville sawbones?" I don't want to make fun of you. Not at all. Ask me why. Why? In France, you must have heard of Sleeping Beauty. I'm rather like her. When you arrived, I seemed to awake from a long sleep. Ah, sorcery wasn't enough -- you're throwing fairytales into the mix! The mouse turns into a woman, the pumpkin into a coach ... Michel is Carabosse, and I'm Prince Charming! - How clever! - Why are you angry? You know I'm speaking figuratively. No one comes wooing me. How can a woman keep young without that? So ... tell me ... ... that since that first night by the falls ... you've been dying to see me again. Even if it's not true! It's true. If not, why would I be here? At last a gallant word! And so ... ... where does that leave us? Do you have to be somewhere? Well, there you are. It's incredible ... ... out of twelve traps, eight have had their bait stolen. The animals in this country are sly. What are you looking for? A drink? No. Will you stay with me this evening? No. Tell me ... When was that picture painted? You're certainly interested in painting ... why? No reason. - Where are the doctor's quarters? - Up there, Madame. Philippe, I'm so proud of you! Twenty bottles of vaccine in a week! It's never been done before! Even Carruel said it. He's so pleased he let me bring fresh supplies myself. - Aren't you glad I'm here? - Of course I am. - Then what's wrong? - Nothing, I'm just tired. Carruel was right -- the climate here's unbearable. Especially when you're not used to it. And we've been working full out. I'm exhausted. Wonderful! I'm so happy! I tell you I'm sick, and that's your response? Listen: Carruel said if you were tired, he advised you to come back now. Lefranc can take your place. If you really fall sick, we'll be in a fine mess. Come back with me. You may be right. I'm completely disoriented here. I can't even think straight. That's it, Oyane! Let's go home! Back to civilization! Macadam! Isn't macadam great? Where are you going today, Philippe? To Libreville! - Already? - Another doctor's replacing him. Rispal will kick him right out. After what he did for you, I don't think it's right. - I may never see him again. - Fine, but what about your replacement? You're right. I'll go see him, but only for my replacement's sake. Oyane, wait here. I'll be right back. Widen that notch! Go on. - Where did you come from? - I'm leaving! - What did you want to tell me? - I'm going back to Libreville. - For good? - I'm ordered back. So, as I'm not suited to the bush ... My replacement is on the way. Please make him welcome. Of course. It's a pity. Someone else will be sorry: Isabelle. She was so happy. - What do you mean? You know? She told you? She told you we met? Why go like a thief in the night? Are you fleeing the bush, or her? It's best I go. She'll be so sorry -- she planned a dinner tonight for the three of us. I was about to invite you. Oh, well. If your mind's made up ... I'm not going. My bag. Where is it? - I'll get it. - You changed your mind? - Yes. Colette's right. We got things done here because Rispal took a shine to me. If he sees a new face, he might make difficulties. I'm sorry, Oyane. - When are you coming back? - As soon as I can. Don't worry. Men are crazy by nature, but out here it's ten times worse. Nothing else? Aren't you hungry? No, thanks. Why are you so jumpy? Looking for something? Or someone? Take this away. I promised she'd be here. She's here. But she felt like being a mouse. Nothing I can do. It's up to her. I'm a fool, a fool! I let Oyane leave and put myself in your hands -- again! What's more, I asked for it! Whether she's your wife, a mouse, or the devil's daughter, I don't care! To hell with all this! You were right to stand up to him. I was so glad. I never can speak to him -- I don't dare. Sometimes he frightens me -- truly he does. Do you like my dress? A bit out of style, no? And yet I've only worn it half a dozen times! No, I won't lie -- not to you. I'll tell you the whole truth. - Do. I've never worn it before. This is the first time. I was waiting for a special occasion. This is it. This isn't about your dress. It's about much more important things. I beg of you, tell me the truth. Which truth? In the forest, truth changes according to the day, the hour, the night ... ... according to the eyes looking at it. That light over there ... It might be the moon's reflection ... ... or the trail left by the river spirits. This tree is a magic tree. Michel cut it down ... ... but its roots lived on. I'm like that. In one way, I exist ... ... in another, I don't. I'll take you far away ... ... where reflections are reflections ... ... and dead trees stay dead. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Say you would! If you really want to ... I'll give you infinitely more. Just say you love me. I could do anything then. Anything? Anything. You've been with Rispal from the start. You're his right-hand man. You know her. You must know her! Where is she hidden? Why does he hide her? Talk! Say something! Fabien! Go see my husband. What are you doing? Is something wrong? Can I help? A pair of shoes. Colette, if there were another white woman around here ... ... wouldn't people know? - Sure! I could have some girl talk ... ... but, on the other hand, I wouldn't be the queen of Monts de Cristal! - And what am I, fair queen? - My jester! I'm not crazy! I saw her, I spoke to her, I touched her! - A tall blonde, right? - Yes! - With blue eyes and a sweet voice? - Yes, yes! - Shall we tell him? - Since everyone knows! It's Mamy Watta! - What'll it be? - A blanket. One blanket, coming up! - Do we still have jam? - Sure thing, here you go ... He took my wife for a night ... ... he must give me the goat ... If I give him the goat ... ... he must give me his wife ... I bought them from a little jeweler on the rue du Sentier. Inexpensive ... ... but it's the thought that counts, no? Opportunity makes the thief. What are you implying? You're doing things backward. One takes the jewelery afterwards, in general. The wife first. Didn't you learn that at university? - I forbid you -- - What? You know what your attempt could cost you? A broken head, a week's pay, or the door, with my foot in your ass. Your choice! I hope you're joking. Of course. - Let me explain -- - Nonsense, we're just having fun. Isabelle, too. Look at her, laughing at us. That's enough! Your act is superb. I was wrong not to take it seriously -- if that makes you happy. But this is too much. And it's a pity ... Because you don't believe in it. Wait. Just to determine whether ... ... a woman can turn into a mouse. Who wants a lovely little white mouse for dinner? - Stop! - Clinical experiment, just your thing! Stop it. I didn't realize you were so sensitive. Have you no shame? And you? Kill him, Philippe. Kill him. You know it's the only way out. Why take pity on him? Did he take pity on me, when he offered me to the cat? No! Kill him. You'll be free of him. We'll be free of him. There'll be nothing separating us -- nothing at all. It must be done, Philippe. No! No! My poor darling ... Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Why -- Something wrong, doc? I heard you shouting. I've got to get out of here. And quick! Before it's too late. Let me pass. I don't want you to go. Let me pass. As you wish. How did you get here? What does it matter, since I found you? He sent you, didn't he? He doesn't like losing his toy. I amused the two of you. I came because you needed me. Really! Then come with me. Where? I need clarity -- light. My complexion can't take sunlight. Too bad. I'll go alone. Alone? You'll never be alone again. Wrong. However long it takes, I'll get free. And one fine day ... ... all will be forgotten ... washed away. You'll never forget me, Philippe. You'll think you're cured ... ... and when you least expect it, I'll be with you. Touching you. And it will all begin again. It's not true. Goodbye, Philippe. See you soon. Oyane ... You, my darling? You look exhausted. Did you drive all night? Don't let me go. Never let me go again. At last! I don't feel comfortable waiting by myself in this crowd. I could understand if it were a crowd of men -- but it's almost all women. Know why I'm late? We've got it! Carruel helped, it's all settled. In two weeks we can move in. - Philippe, it's too wonderful! Two big rooms, a kitchen, and a real bathroom! Philippe, let's celebrate! Dinner at a Chinese restaurant, and then a movie ... ... and then dancing! And in two weeks we'll have a real home of our very own! Where are you going? You, Isabelle? Yes, me. It can't be. But it is. Isabelle, you were right. I'm always thinking of you. It's torture. Now that I'm here, you must feel better! I don't know. You seem so cold. As though you didn't know me. Are you angry? - Not at all! I'm just trying to adjust. Where did we meet? How could you forget? At Monts de Cristal. Oh, of course! What a night! Here we are! The first time I've seen you laugh. Now you know how! Whiskey? So, what do you have to tell me? Whatever you like. Now that I've found you ... ... I'll never leave again. So intense! How different you are. Different from whom? Different ... ... from yourself. It is you? Yes, it's me! Do you live here? Yes! Nicer than living in the forest. The forest? Oh, yes, the bush. He let you leave? - Who? - Michel. Michel? Answer me. You said ... ... when you least expect it, I'll be with you. Touching you. But then you had too much mystery. Now you have too little. Isabelle ... My name is less romantic, but at least it's my own. It's Catherine. It can't be. You're a funny guy. But I've lost interest. Bye! Oyane, would you clean these instruments? What's wrong? Something's up with you lately. I know you, I've been watching. No, nothing's wrong. Doctor, may I ask you something? In France ... In France what? Does a married man often think about other women? What are you talking about! Do your work, don't look for trouble. What's wrong with you? Excuse me. Do you want to buy this, sir? Isn't it pretty? Shit! What's wrong, daughter? This time I'm sure -- there's another woman on his mind. The white man can't fight Mamy Watta. Only ONE can cure your husband ... ... do exactly what he says. All the supplies packed? All there. Mosquito net? Whiskey? Here. Take this. You can pick up the rest later. What are you waiting for? Boss, the mountain people heard the elephants call. - Well? - It's not good. It means death. It means the herd is near and the hunt will be good. Don't forget the machete. You're in luck. You almost missed me. Where is she? I must see her, speak to her. Of course. Sit down. She just went out for a stroll. She'll be back soon. Have a drink while you're waiting. - Will you be gone long? - "Vous"? So formal. Has the city made a snob of you? I meant the two of you -- you are taking her along? In theory, yes. A little over a month. There are elephant herds to the north. You won't take her with you, Michel. I've come to take her from you. - Really. You'll need her consent, won't you? I'll ask her. You'll ask her. When she gets back. There she is. Isabelle ... ... I've come for you. You're leaving with me. Aren't you? It's not up to me, Philippe. What does she say? You heard her. She's hesitating. It's to be expected, put yourself in her place. She loves me too. That's not true. She told me she hates you. No kidding. Say it again, Isabelle. No need to be afraid. I'm here to protect you. It's true. I hate him. I'm sorry, Michel. I'm sorry; I'm the victor. I can't give her up, she can't give me up. Tell him you love me. Tell him you'll always love me. Say it, Isabelle. I love you. Louder. So he knows it. So he understands. I love you. Did you hear that? She told me that, too. But what you don't know ... ... is that Isabelle died twenty years ago. With my own hands I buried her. You can go see for yourself. - What are you talking about? Right by this house. I don't believe you. I can't believe you. You thought you'd steal her from me. You knew only an image. Do you know what you drank, each time you came here? Iboga. The liquor of illusions, hallucinations, mirages ... Isabelle was at the bottom of your glass. - I spoke to her, she answered me. - You questioned and answered yourself. It's not true. You're lying. I've drunk myself dead with that same liquor. Anything was better than loneliness and despair. To hell with your grief. Tell me the truth. Why did you do it? What were you after? Spit it out! You were so sure of yourself when you came here ... ... with your science, logic, reason. I wanted to teach you a lesson. I wanted you to realize that things aren't that simple. You saw the portrait. You took the bait. And then ... ... it was a way for me to bring her to life again ... ... even if it was through you. Do you want to drink again? I should kill you. All is well. Don't cry. Your husband is saved.
