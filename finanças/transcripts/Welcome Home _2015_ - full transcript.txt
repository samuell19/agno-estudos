Thank you, Stewart. That was just heavenly. I could live in Hawaii. It's beautiful, but I like coming home to the energy of the city. I love how well we travel together. It's a true test of our relationship, I think. Oh, it's just a preview of coming attractions. Back to the real world! Uh, don't forget Lincoln's party tomorrow night at atrium. 'Cause that's what I do best. You know I hate those things. There's going to be a lot of people there that can be help you promote your new book, which, I have to say, I didn't see you write a single word of the entire time that we were away. Well, you see, this is not writing... this is typing. The writing takes place up here. Now that I'm home, you know, no distractions, I'm going to let it flow. Okay, well, as your literary agent, i... I expect to see you at that party tomorrow night. I have about a million emails to answer. And you are going to go inside and let it flow... Right. Yes. And, um, I will see you again tomorrow, at the party. Will they have free wine? Champagne! Yes. Okay. Go. Go write. Oh! And wear a suit. A nice one. Weird. Really? Who's there? Hey! What the... Son of a... hey! -Whoa! -Jake, enough. Mom, I got this. What are you doing in my house? You're scaring my sister! You shouldn't be here! What are you... what's going on here, lady? Look, Mr. Paylor, I'm sorry. How do you know my name? It was on your mail. You read my mail? No, not exactly. We were just... look, it was cold outside, and... and... Jake, I've got this under control. We needed a place to stay. So, what, you're camping at my house? How'd you get in? You broke in. You broke into my house. Okay. What are you doing? -I'm calling the police. -No, okay, wait. Just don't call the police, okay? We're leaving. Okay? Kids. Go get your bags. We're leaving. Put that down. Put it down, Jake. Okay? What now? We'll figure something out. We always do. Okay? That's your dad, right? Yeah. He doesn't look like the kind of guy who'd kick US out into the cold. What happened to you? Mr. Paylor, this is Dan cauley from American express gold card. Please return my call at 800-327-2177 at... Message deleted. Next message. Yo, stew! Angelo. How was Hawaii? I got the past five games all taped, buddy. Let's connect this week if you ain't too busy with your hipster friends. What do you say? Later. Message saved. Next message. Mr. Paylor, this is Evita salvo from chase bank. You need to call me as soon as possible regarding your October and November mortgage pay... message deleted. End of messages. Here's some more coffee. Thanks. So, what, are you following me? No, we were just walking by. What, do you own this street? I must've missed the sign. Did you take a pocket knife off my desk? 'Cause it's missing. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you take the knife, Jake? He probably lost it. No, I did not lose it. Oh, for cryin' out... do US both a favor, will you? Just take this and go. Yeah, we don't want your guilt money. Yes, we do! No, we don't. Look, you really want to help US? Drive US to a shelter. I don't have a car. Liar! We slept in your garage last night. -You what? -I'm sorry. It was freezing. We had nowhere else to go. Come on, just take US to a shelter. We'll be out of your hair. That's my dad's old Van. I hardly ever drive it. I'm very busy today. Yeah, we can see that. Have a heart, Mr. Paylor. Do me a favor and watch the kids while I check it out. Well, I've got stuff... I'll just be a couple of minutes, okay? So how are you guys doing? We have names, you know. Yeah. You're Jake. I got that. Little girl, what's your name? Really? I'm just trying to be friendly here. She doesn't talk? Fine. Have it your way. Look, kid, you can't stay at my house. It's just the way it is. That's the way you are. That's the way the world is! You've got no right to be in my house. You're intruders. You're lucky... I could've called the police and had you arrested. Yeah, we're real lucky. Thanks for pointing that out. Oh. Yeah. Hello, Cynthia. Are you sleeping? Oh, no, I'm writing away. It's going pretty good. You must be working hard. Absolutely. I miss you. Yeah, i... I miss you too. And you're coming tonight? Yep, i... I'll be there. Okay, good. Okay, bye. Right. How long is this going to take? There's no room. I'll talk to them. Excuse me. You telling me you can't find a bed for a lady and her kids? I'm sorry, man, but we only house men. No exceptions. I can probably find a cot for you, but I just don't have a permit for your wife and children. They're not my family. Well, where'd you all stay last night? At my house, but that's... that's not going to work again. You knew I was coming back sooner or later. What was your plan? Why me? Why my house? I know another place. This is the fourth shelter we have been to today. Yeah, it's like that every day. Do you know what that's like? Look, it's not a shelter, but it'll do for a night, till a shelter opens up, okay? Where is this place? Passengers boarding the Tacoma bus... This is the closest depot. Will it do? It's dry, and it beats jail. Are you offering an alternative? I didn't think so. All right, kids, come on, let's go. Jake, no arguing, please. Vera, wake up. We're at the holiday inn. It's all I got. Thanks. I owe you. Mom, come on. Vera's cold. My mom's name is Cassandra. Now you know everyone's name. Can't we just stop at a bus depot for a few hours or something? It's patrolled. You know we can't take that chance. Yeah? What, you can't call a brother back? Aw, hey, man. I'm buried here. Well, I'm coming to your rescue. Yeah? How so? Well, the guys are coming to my place to bowl tonight. I bet 'em 20 bucks that I could get you to show up. Ange, I'm working on a tight deadline. Ange... Working hard in a suit, huh? Cynthia's got me going to some work function. It's a long story. Ahh, no need to make time for old friends. Angelo. Come on... My god. How long were they there? I think a few days. Well, did they damage anything? No. But they did water my plants. Whoa. "Nightmare on maple street." But seriously, you must've been terrified. I was at first, yeah. I'm just glad that you're all right. Do you think that maybe she was on drugs? No. No, I think something happened to them. They seemed more desperate than dangerous. Mm. Sarah grimes. Uh, stolamagazine. It's the next... ... vanity fair. I've been playing phone tag with her for weeks. Um, if you'll excuse me. I just find it fascinating, you know, which panhandlers are more successful than others. Uh, what? Yeah. I read this story about this guy at the airport. He makes 50 grand a year. He takes vacations. Okay, we'll sit right there. Okay, watch your sister. Stewart. You remember Sarah? Yeah. Hi, Sarah. How have you been? Cynthia said some wonderful things about your new book... vague things. She says you won't even divulge the title. With anyone else, I'd say it was hype, but I absolutely adored plumber's wrench. Well, this one I think I should probably keep under wraps until it's finished. You know, sometimes mystery's good for business. Sarah would like an advance peek at the masterpiece. We just had a space open up in our spring issue, and your biggest fan has convinced me give it to you. We'd love to an excerpt from Stewart paylor. And it would be great buzz for the new book. We'd have to have it ready in a week. Can your client deliver? -Well... -of course he can. And the photo shoot and interview, that would have to happen a.S.A.P. We'd send someone to your place, keep it super-easy. That's fantastic 'cause he's got a great tan and he looks so cute. You have a big fan, Stewart, and a very persuasive one. Looking forward to seeing what you've got. Good night, darlings. I had her eating out of my hands. Well, that's because you are a fantastic agent/girlfriend. And you are a fantastic writer/boyfriend. Listen, uh, I've got to go. I've got to get some writing done. Okay? Oh. And, um, I don't have my credit card... Oh. That's... fine. Um... well, you sure you can't stay a little bit longer? Yeah, I, uh.. I've got a lot of ideas that are coming right now. I've got to get 'em out, so... I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Have a good night. Vera! Do not touch that. That's a needle. Hey, Angelo, i... all right, I'm willing to forgive you. Oh, man, I tell you, I'm underwater here. I am so over my head. Yeah? You sound like I just woke you up. Just woke up? I'm just getting the writing started. It's freaking 1:00 in the morning. What is this, hipster writer hours? Ha ha. What do you want from me, brother? I want to hang out, man. Yeah, so do I. I swear on my mother, I'm sorry. Yeah. I know. But I'm gonna keep on your case till you cave. Yeah, of course you are. You wouldn't be you if you didn't. Wake up. We got to go. Come on. Come on, we got to go. Everybody out! Everybody in here, let's go! Don't... it's going to be okay. Just let me handle it, all right? We're on a waiting list at the shelter, and I'm looking for work. We just need to get out of the rain. We won't get in your way, I promise. We have nowhere else to go. One night? One night. Thank you. Okay. Go. Come on... Is it okay if the kids take baths? Try and keep to the living room. Thank you. Okay! Come on, kids! Nice warm baths for everybody. Hi, sweetie. You're probably writing up a storm... no pun intended. I mean, this is the perfect day for it. This is a reminder call thatthe stola interview is today at 11:00. Dress nice, be charming, and give them a tease about the new book. Now back to your writing. Mwah! At some point, you're going to have to tell him. Just stop talking, Jake. Enough. No, I'm not going to stop. Where are we sleeping tonight? Where are we sleeping tomorrow night? I don't know. Maybe a spot will open up at the shelter. I'll figure something out, okay? I'm doing the best I can here. You promised to take care of US. And I will! Now, let it go. Morning, Mr. Paylor. "Stewart." I hope you don't mind. There wasn't much in your cupboards, but there's cereal. Would you like some coffee? Or tea? I'm pretty sure I saw some. So, what's the plan? Well, I wanted to talk to you about that. Would you like to sit? No. I'm fine. Thank you. Kids, go play outside. What for? Just because I said so. Now go. You'd better tell him. Tell me what? This is my home, Stewart. Uh, well, the bank says it's mine. I've made breakfast, lunch, and dinner in this kitchen thousands of times. Jake and Vera grew up here. You saw the murals on the bedroom walls before you painted over them? Yeah... We made those. You're sleeping in my old room. Look, these notches are the kids' heights, since they were little. Two years ago, my husband, David, died of leukemia. I'm sorry. We went through all our savings on medical and household bills, 'cause I had to quit my job to take care of him. And a year ago, the bank evicted US. I knew it was a foreclosure. I... Of course. You got a good deal. Why would you think about the other side of the equation? There's a whole lot of US, though... On the other side, and it's not pretty. What happened? Ah, we stayed with friends for a while, but that got old... Mostly for them. One couple lost their house, too. I felt inside-out. For a while, we stayed in my car, but then it got towed... And I didn't have the money to get it back. And my computer and our clothes were in there. And then I got a job, and for four months, we had a place, and it really seemed like we were climbing out of the hole... But it didn't work out. And we ended up in the park, and it got rainy and cold and... And I ran out of options. This is the last place we used to call home. We used to walk by here sometimes. And we saw you leave with your suitcases and your girlfriend, I guess, and I figured you were going on vacation, and that night, well... I knew a way in. I figured... We'd stay for a few days, and what would be the harm? Look, I know this has turned your life upside down, but I was hoping that we could come to an arrangement. No, no, no. I... Even if what you're telling me is true, i... I feel bad for you, but it just... you... you can't just... come back. That's not... I have my own problems right now, you know. I... No, I just... I'll cook and clean for you. The kids will be quiet. I really don't think it's a good idea. Okay, I got my work, and that is important, and I got people coming. My girlf... agent, we have a meeting. I'll stay out of the way, we'll... you're not getting it, okay? My life is complicated. I'm under a lot of pressure right now. You asked for one night, and I gave you one night, okay? Now, it's not raining now, so enjoy your breakfast, but after that, you guys have to get going. I have work to do. But I don't know when the shelter space will open up. I know you've had some tough breaks. "Tough breaks?" You call these tough breaks? Look, if this really was your home, I feel bad for you. That's weird... But it's not your home anymore. Okay? And you've got to find a solution for you and your children. That is not my responsibility. I can't save you. You don't think I'm trying? I'm trying, Stewart! A lot of US are trying, and it's just not enough. I'm not responsible for them! I'm only responsible for me, not you or anybody else. So I'm going to go into my study and I'm going to write for about an hour, and when I come out, if you're still here, I'm going to call the police. End of the story. It's going to be okay, baby. Why do you tell her that? Every time you do, things get worse. Vera, don't believe her. Jake? What are you doing? Getting out of here! I'll be better off on my own. Jake. Jake! Come back. Jake! Jake! Jake! Vera, stay right there! Cassandra? Kids? All right... Hey. You must be Stewart? -Yeah. -I'm Wesley Cole. Come in. I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy day to do this. Yeah. No problem. My photographer's just getting her stuff from the car. He's going to take some shots of US while we chat, okay? Where are we setting up? -Uh, the patio. -Okay. Will this work? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's perfect. Thanks. I'm going to edit this over the weekend so that I can get your excerpt into the spring issue. If not, then we're both in a lot of doo-doo. Just kidding. -Actually, not kidding at all. -This weekend? Yeah. Is that going to be a problem? No, not a... problem. Oh, hi! Who's this beautiful little girl? Are you Stewart's daughter? My niece. Uh, Vera. How old are you? She doesn't talk much. Her and her mother are visiting. Her mother's out right now. I'll set up. Listen, Vera. I need you to do me a favor, okay, and, um, be my niece. We're just pretending. Okay? You don't have to do anything. Just don't say anything. You don't speak anyway, do you? I mean, I've never heard you speak. I... it... listen, the trick is just be quiet, okay? Quiet is what is called for. Stewart! Hi, mom. I didn't know that you were coming over. Oh, well, I didn't know you had company either. I'm sorry, I just brought you some groceries. Oh, yeah. This is, uh, Wesley. Yeah, he's from stolamagazine . They're like vanity fair. They're going to do an interview on me. Oh! Hello, Wesley. Hi. And you know Vera. Um, I'm not sure that I do. Ahem! I'll explain later. Oh... Sweetheart, would you like to come and help me unpack these groceries? She's not talking much today, mom. Okay. Um, I need someone to help me bake some cookies. Do you think you could do that? Okay. You come with me. Thattagirl. Hey. I'm sorry about that. Jake! Jake! Jake! Plumber's wrench was a collection of deeply authentic vignettes about the human condition... from mansions to low-income apartments... all revolving around a character named Lou. My dad. Yeah, he was a salt-of-the-earth kind of guy. You know, very wise. Funny. Great storyteller. He was a pretty good plumber, too... Not a very good businessman. We never had much. Always lived in a walk-up apartment. It's the first time in my life I've ever lived in a house. The only thing pop cared about was mom... Family, people. That was his thing... people. He'd go out to fix a broken pipe, come home with a story. I'd sit and listen to the stories almost every night, and one night, I just decided to start writing them down. What was his reaction to you writing the book? Actually, he... He never knew. I was going to surprise him with it when I got finished, but, uh, he had a heart attack and died on the job one day. Never saw it. I'm sorry. Funny thing is, dad worked in all kinds of neighborhoods, all kinds of houses, and everybody... they loved him. Judges, cabbies, artists... whatever. So at the funeral, man, that place was packed. Must've been 400, 500 people there. For the eulogy, I read from the book, and there was a publisher in the crowd. Dad had cleaned his drains a few times over the years. Next thing I know, I got a book. It's a best-seller. It's pretty wild. Although he never got to read the book, pop was my writing partner. Hey! Hey! Let's talk about the new book. You're on your own now. No "writing partner." What's the genre? Is it going to be anything like your first book? Similar, it will be similar, yet... Different. Can you give me a slant? That's what these interview pieces are for... you want to whet people's appetites. The excerpt you're going to give US, is it from the beginning of the book, or the middle...? Definitely the beginning. Um... I feel like I would just like to let the work speak for itself. Uh, Wesley, thanks for the interview. Yeah, um, I really need you just to tell me something about the book... -hey, everyone. -Cynthia, hi. Hi. I made it. Yeah, so how did the interview go? Yeah, Sarah was looking for some hints on the new book, but Stewart's kind of keeping it under wraps, and now we've got to hit the road. Right now? Yeah, sorry, I'm squeezing this between some other stuff. Okay, well, can we finish up tomorrow? Yeah, maybe. On the phone, if you think there's more to get. Stewart will be ready, I promise. Won't you? Cynthia! Muriel. Oh, I thought I heard your voice. I didn't know that you'd be here. And who is this little one? Uh, have I never introduced my niece? Vera? Never mentioned her? No, you haven't. Hi, Vera. It's very nice to meet you! I'm Cynthia. Jake! -Is he here? -Jake? Uh, no... Please, I couldn't find him on foot. I need your Van. No, that's not... that's not... then help me. I've got to find him. Stewart? What's going on, and who's this? This is Cassandra. It's complicated, but it's okay, okay? Okay. Okay, let's go. All right, you know what? This is my mother. Will Vera stay with her? I've got to go find your brother. Are you okay to stay here like a big girl? Okay. Mom? Look after Vera, and then we'll call you as soon as we can. Cynthia, I'm sorry, I'll explain when I get back. Sure. This is where I last saw him. Well, let's call the police. No. No police. Jake! There he is. What is it? Oh, okay. Now we've got to get him to the hospital. No, it's okay, I just need to get him cleaned up and disinfected. Can we go back to your place? I'll just get him cleaned up, and then we'll leave? I got a better idea. Angelo! Hey! Have you got a first aid kit? -Yeah, just a sec. -Need some help. What's going on, stew? What happened? Bike accident. Thank you. I got this. I'm going to the washroom. -Now? -Yes. Wash your cut in there! I'll go with him. Thank you. Hi. Hi. What really happened today, Jake? My mom can't do anything right. Is that so? Looks kind of rough. I tripped. Who was chasing you? Some guy. Why was "some guy" chasing you? I was trying to get some food, okay? I was going to bring it home for verie. It's no big deal. No, it is a big deal, Jake. You look like you got run over. You could be in trouble with the police, then what... get off my back. You're not my dad. Jake! What was that all about? It's nothing. He's, um, he's fine. He just needs some time to chill out. So... I was thinking maybe you guys should come stay for a few days, until you found a place at the shelter. Rule one... There's no more drama. And two... you and the kids keep in the living room. I'm writing. Yeah, I need peace and quiet. Okay. Thank you, Stewart. "Bike accident," huh? You will have to fill me in someday. Well... This is "someday." You got that right. This is some day. Vera, you are such a good drawer. Oh! Ow! Careful. Vera insisted on waiting up for you. She's been bathed and fed, and there's freshly baked cookies, if anyone's hungry. Cassandra, we didn't get to be formally introduced earlier. I'm Muriel, Stewart's mom, and you must be Jake. Hi, Jake. You can call me "Mrs. P." All Stewart's friends do. You said something about cookies? I'm starving. Yeah. I'll walk mom out. Thank you for taking care of Vera. Oh, you're welcome. She is a lovely kid. I hope we meet again. Good night. Me too. Good night, Mrs. P. I don't know why I called her my niece. It just came out, you know? It's like it's a nightmare. I just can't wait for it to be over. Do you remember how your dad used to frustrate you when you were a young teen? What do you mean? Well, you'd ask him a question, I mean, a big question... not like "why is the sky blue?" But... important. Something that happened at school maybe, and he... he would answer with a story. Usually something that happened on the job. Remember? Oh, I remember. Yeah. It was annoying. You used to get so frustrated when he wouldn't answer you. You'd come and ask me. Yeah. Why give a three-word answer when 3,000 will do? I asked him why he did that, and he said... He said, "because "I won't always be here for him to ask me what I would do." And then he said what he always said... "the answers are right there. We just need to pay attention." Quite the day. Yeah. Thanks for all the help, mom. Of course. Oh! And before she left, Cynthia said something about finishing your phone interview tomorrow. Someone's going to call you. Yeah, i... I know. Thanks. And you might think about giving Cynthia a call. I know that too, mom. I... messed things up pretty good. Then fix it. 10 pages... 10 pages. 10 pages. Mr. Paylor, this is elrich mantis from chase bank. Evita salvo turned your mortgage file over to me for review. Mr. Paylor, we need to talk... Uh, morning, Stewart. It's Wesley Cole at, um... -00 A.M., calling to finish our interview. I spoke with Sarah and we're definitely going to need something more. You missed breakfast. There's cookies. How's the arm? Feels weird, but okay. Leg's sore. Where's your mom? Out. What do you mean, out? She went looking for work. When's she going to be back? I don't know. She left you here alone? You're here. Verie's somewhere. Hmm. Do you know what a deadline is? -Duh. -Yeah, well... If you don't make 'em, you're usually in big trouble, and I am way behind. And? And I was going to spend my day working, not baby-sitting for a couple of... do what you got to do. We can take of ourselves. Did your mother tell you the rules? Stay in the living room. Yeah. So do that. Now. Think of it as, like, um, its own country... it's got a border around it, and you need a passport to cross it. I'm the only one that can stamp that passport. When your mother gets home, you share that with her. Aye-aye, captain. Halt! Turn the music down. Passport, please. -Out of the way. -I'm sorry, sir, but you don't have permission to enter our country. Really? I own your country. This is exactly the kind of stuff I was talking about. What is that? It's a fort! Pizza delivery! Oh, so you ordered pizza, Jake? No! Hey, stew. Took the day off. Thought I'd come by and kick your butt. Yeah, well, you are, because I'm trying to write and it's like king street station in here, brother. Hey, you're doing a good thing here, bro, and about the other night? Hey, I forgive you. Kids. -You like pizza? -Sure! Well, come and get it, I made it myself. We can't. We're stuck in our own country. What? Stuck where? I relegated them to the living room because I have to work. Can't get out without a passport, and guess who's the king in charge? You have gotten so weird, man. Hey, kids, I'm liberating you for pizza. Why don't you join US, your majesty? Extra mozzarella, like you like it. Just saying. You kids like bowling? Yeah. Let's go! So how's that arm, Jake? Ahh, it's all right. And you must be Vera. I hear you're a big talker. This is great. You take these guys bowling, ange, I get some work done. No, no, no, no, no. That is not at all what I had in mind. -Huh? -You owe me a match. Hey, you guys want to see me and stew in a serious blood match? -Yeah. -No. Loser pays for dinner? Are we driving in this? We are, but the pizza's not, huh? Remember what you told me two days ago? You swear on your mother, next time you'll go? Those were your exact words. -I know, but... -hey, no, no, no. You do not take a sacred oath on your mother in vain, my friend. I got an excerpt to write, okay? I got an interview coming up. I'm working. Stewart, you're a freaking train wreck! What you need is to relax a little. Come on, we'll roll a few frames, you come on back here and finish your "exert." I'll even help you. -It's an "excerpt." -Whatever! Come on, get your ball and your bowling shoes. Let's go! You see what I got to deal with? He's always been like that! That's right, and I always will be. Stop whining. Hey! Pizza! Out of the car. -Yeah! -That's pretty good. Nice shot. -It's a nine. -Oh, man, you're pitiful. Come on, Vera, let's go, let's show 'em how it's done. Orange? Orange ball? All right, let's go put that up there. Put that down there. Both hands on there. Give it a nice roll down there... Verie, you got to throw it harder. It's never going to get there. Hey. Hey... Yeah, hey! That's what I'm talking about! Yeah! Hey, Vera, you get to go again. Come on. Hey. Well, what about Angelo? He's a pretty good coach. You can't do better than a strike. Here, you're going to need a ball if we're going to do this. Okay. Now, you just... You see that? That's why we used to call him "details." What do you mean? He's a detail man. If he's going to help you with something, he's going to do it right. I never would've made it through high school if he hadn't coached me in math and English and social studies and home ec and... What's this? It's his girlfriend. Nah. He's having a good time. You guys have been friends a long time. More like brothers. His dad knew mine, brought him in here to bowl. Best buds ever since. He runs kind of hot and cold with US. Yeah... You caught him at a weird time. He's going through some kind of phase. All right, ange, you're up. All right. I'm up. Let's go. Come on, Vera, I need your help here. Let's see... This is really... Pretty great. You know, it's kind of crazy that I'm here, but, uh, you're right, it's pretty great. Better than Hawaii. Come on. Well, maybe not better than Hawaii, but... still pretty great. I want to ask you a question, Jake. What? Why were you and your mother so afraid of going to the hospital? Who said we were afraid? Easy. I'm not... I'm just asking because I want to know. You going to tell my mom? I'm not going to tell your mom. I promise. After my dad died, we started from scratch. We came home one day... The locks were changed, they threw all our clothes on the lawn, and they kept all of our stuff. They kept everything... my bat, my glove, all my games... They even kept Vera's Teddy bear. Yeah. I think your mom told me something about that. She didn't tell you everything. She had a job working nights, dispatching cabs. We had an apartment. It was crowded, but... At least we weren't sleeping on the streets. Some days, she had a double shift and I had to come home straight from school to look after verie. One day... I got detention, and... By the time I got home, the neighbors called the cops 'cause verie was left alone and she was scared. What happened then? The judge said that mom couldn't take care of US anymore. We got sent to a foster place. That sucked so much. Verie hasn't said a word since that day. She's scared we're going to get taken away or something. Mom spent all her pay on lawyers to try to get US back, then she lost her job for missing too many days. Everything fell apart. We ended up back on the street. It's all my fault for being late that day. How did you get back to your mom? She snuck US out one night. Said, without a permanent address, it'd be the only way that we'd be together. She gets caught, then she'll go to jail, and we'll be in foster care for good. So she's just trying to get enough pay to get US out of Seattle. Where would you go? You do not take my children anywhere without my permission! Mom, it's okay. We went bowling. Jake, you know better than that! And Stewart, what the hell were you thinking? Well, we woke up, and you weren't here, which breaks our agreement, and you didn't exactly leave a list of instructions. I was working! Mom, we had fun. Remember "fun"? You practically scared me to death. Okay, you kids go take your showers. -It's not even 4:00! -Just do it. Stewart and I have things to discuss. Ah, don't even think about it. -Stewart. -Mom. Mom! Don't do anything dumb, okay? Don't talk to me like that! Didn't I just tell you to go take a shower? Yeah, you did. I just don't want to come back out here and find out we're sleeping on the streets again, but hey, at least I'm clean because I took a shower. Since when are you and Stewart such good buddies? He's okay! At least he listens to me. You know what? That's enough. You and your sister march to that bathroom right now. Don't get your bandage wet. Stewart. This is the third time that I've called. What's going on, and who was that woman and that girl? Wesley told me that you haven't picked up all day. I don't know whether to be worr... Leave me alone. We need to talk. Feel free to leave at any time. Not until we get one thing straight. Those kids are my life. I took them bowling. They're children. They need more of that. So... I don't know how to parent now? That's not what I said. Would you at least have the decency to look at me when we're talking? I don't want to be talking, I want to be working, and here you are, yet again, stopping me from doing that, so please get out now and let me get on with my life. You are so selfish. What's that? None of your business. You're in here playing computer games? -It helps me think. -Oh, really? Is that what you're doing, "thinking"? So where's the writing? Let's see it. Let's see the excerpt your girlfriend was talking about. -Agent. -"Agent." Girlfriend/agent. Or maybe you don't have it to show, do you? It's a simple question. Do you have a chapter? Do you have anything at all? -Please get out. -You don't, do you? You don't have a single word written, and you're lecturing me about taking responsibility? I've heard your messages, and I've seen your mail. What a phony. I might be broke, but at least I'm not pretending to be something I'm not. Could be somebody else is going to get a good deal on this house pretty soon. Mom, stop it. Stewart, don't listen to her! Why aren't you in the shower? Why are you doing this? He let US stay here. Stewart. He's been lying to US all along about the writing. -He doesn't care about US. -No, you're wrong. He's the only one who's taken care of US. Mommy. Vera? Sweetheart? Stewart's in trouble. Jake, no! Just... Just stay here with Vera. I'll go. I won't screw up. I promise. I'm sorry. You're going through a really hard time, and we're not making it any easier. And I had no right to say those cruel things to you. Vera told me to come get you. She spoke. She was worried about you. Can I just buy you a cup of coffee? When you're right, you're right. I'm not a writer. I'm a phony. What are you talking about? Plumber's wrench is really good. -You've read it? -I'm halfway through. Hmm. Well, those were my father's stories. Those aren't even mine. But you wrote them from your perspective, with your words. I mean, isn't that what writers do? I don't know what writers do. My dad, he always knew the right thing to do. I wish he was here now. Being a grown-up sucks sometimes. Yeah. When I was a kid, I used to pretend to fall asleep on the couch, you know, and he'd carry me to bed. And it felt... Safe. Something like that. You do have your own stories to tell, Stewart. We all do. You just got to dig a little deeper. I don't know that I have anything deeper. You don't believe that, do you? I don't believe that. Give it your best effort. When was the last time you saw your parents? 14 years ago. So they've never met Jake and Vera? When I was 18, I got pregnant by a boy who didn't want anything to do with it. My father couldn't forgive me, and he had a temper. My mother tried to run interference, and she paid a big price for that. But I had a piece of creation inside me and it made me strong, which just... Pissed my dad off even more. And then a week before my due date, he was in a rage and he slapped me. My mother stepped in between. She told me to get as far away from Chicago as I could. And they were still fighting when I ran out the back door with a few dollars and just whatever I could carry. The greyhound took me to Seattle, and Jake was born at county hospital a few days later. More coffee? Warm-up? Yeah, it was tough for a while. But I went to community college, and I made my way. And then I met David... And he fell for both of US, and we got married, and he adopted Jake, and then came Vera and... Things were good. Better than good. When David died, I... I broke into a thousand little pieces, and I'm still trying to glue myself back together. But you got to fight for what you need in this world, Stewart. You can't give up. Stewart! What? Hey! Did you just say my name? Uh-huh. Wow! I like that. That's cool. I got some groceries. That's right, I had a little work today. Thank you very much. So Stewart's going to write, and we're going to make dinner. Sound like a plan? Okay. Okay? All right! Get to work, Mr. Paylor. What is it? Treasure? I found this in the garage. We had to leave it when we were... had to leave. What's the point? It's a time machine. Petrified wood... believe it or not, this used to be alive once. Look. This was mine when I was little, Vera. Would you like it, Vera? Do you remember me telling you how your grandpa sailed the Great Lakes solo when he was 16, and it took the whole summer? Well, this was his compass. Here, you take it, Jake, so you'll never get lost. Whoa. Is that you? Yeah, sure is! And those are your grandparents. Who's that fuzzy boy? Oh, that "fuzzy boy" is my brother Adam, your uncle Adam. He set the timer on the camera and he was running to get into the shot. He was always moving fast. Where's he now? I wish I knew. Lookit! This is your dad on his graduation day. Mommy. Mm-hmm. Tell about when I was born. Oh, not this again. We've heard this story a million times. Please? Just once more. Okay. Okay, it was in this very room. We'd only been living here about three months, but when we bought the place, we were already thinking about a home birth and we thought that this room would be perfect. It was a Tuesday night. I wasn't due for another nine days, but when the contractions started, I knew this was it, so I called your dad and he called the midwife. And where was Jake? He was asleep on a pad right next to US. He didn't want to miss your arrival. And where was I? You were still inside me, but you were definitely, definitely wanting to come out! Finish the story. So it went on for several more hours, way past midnight. It was pretty intense. And then, when the midwife was helping me, your dad went over to the piano and he started singing. I think I remember that. -Uh-huh? -That's not possible. Well, I don't know, stranger things have happened. I remember the song! That's 'cause you've heard this story, like, a bajillion times. Or maybe it's because he made it up especially for you. See, 'cause I'd yell, "it's getting stronger," and he'd sing, ♪ the feeling's getting stronger ♪ ♪ and it won't be much longer ♪ He was silly and beautiful. Then, finally, you decided to make your entrance. Jake, you were awake by then and you were holding my hand, and your dad's face was glowing. Then he looked me in the eyes and he started laughing, and Jake, you started laughing, and even though I was in pain, I started laughing, too, and I think the midwife thought we were all nuts. But the best moment of all, Vera, was when you were born, and your dad held you up and I saw your beautiful face for the first time, and I swear, baby, you were laughing too. And then we realized it was the morning of Valentine's day, which was perfect. And I am so happy to hear your voice again. We have missed it so much. Okay, sleepy-byes. Lots of dreams. I'm going to go soak in a hot tub until I turn into a duck. About time. Everything okay? I lied. I took it when you were on vacation. My dad gave me this when I was about your age. Are you going to call the police? Aw, it's just a thing, Jake. Things, they come and they go, but... It means a lot to me, so I'm glad you returned it. Thank you. And... Send. Jake. What? Breakfast. I just finished and hit "send," and if you need to blame anybody for anything, it's me. Call me back. Good morning, Stewart! Hey, Vera. Good morning. You guys hungry? Yeah. Did you sleep in your clothes? No, I didn't sleep in 'em, I worked in 'em. You can cook? Mm-hmm. Who likes waffles? -Me! -I do. Today is Saturday, so we're celebrating. Smells like somebody's been busy. -Good morning. -Morning. I finished the first chapter. It's going to be the excerpt for the magazine, and I was going to outline a few of the others. I hope that you like it. I'm sure I will. I had an idea. I was thinking that, maybe after breakfast, we could take a walk. Can we, mom? Please? Actually... I would love a little time to myself. Why don't you kids go for a walk with Stewart and I'll see you when you get back? Just me and them? Okay! You guys heard your mother. Eat up. Then we hit the road. Check it out. 20 bucks. Whoa! Good eye. You got to pick it up. Nah. You saw it. That's yours. Family rule. Found money... you pick it up, goes into the family pot. Can't buy anything. But, if you pick it up... Oh, okay. I get it. Nice one, Jake. Let's go bowling. Well, I can't today, Vera. How about... How 'bout a pretzel? Sure. Oh, Stewart... "She sits across the formica table in my favorite greasy spoon..." When David died, I gave up his ghost, and found I was left with a broken spirit. So many pieces, and not near enough glue... ...she spoke slowly, haltingly. A tunnel opened up and swallowed me the day social services took my kids... Sipped my coffee and, slowly opening up to me about her life... I've lived there ever since, in a different place from the real world, a world where people laugh and love and argue and tuck their babies into bed... I could see the pain in her eyes as she relived a life of living on the streets from one day to the next. ...only a scalding bath can wash away the stink and make me feel human again for a while. Can we play 20 questions? Well, I don't know. It sounds pretty good. Who goes first? What's your favorite kind of food? That's easy. Pizza. Your turn. Stewart... Yeah? Do you ever think about your dad? Yes, I do. I think about my dad all the time. I miss him very much. What about you? You ever think of your dad? All the time. You know what bugs me? I can't remember his face anymore. That comes back. I have dreams about my dad. It's just like we're having a visit. That's cool. I miss him a lot. Me too. You guys are lucky that you have each other. See, I never had a brother or a sister. Always thought it'd be nice to have somebody to play with. -Stewart? -Hmm? Are you going to kick US out again? Stew, look at this. Fuzzy dice. Oh, yeah. Those are cool. Can I get 'em? Come on. They're pretty cool. I don't know, Jake. I was kind of thinking something where we could spend a little time together. Flowers for mom? There you go. That's a great idea. Super idea. Okay, hide those behind your back. Keep your coats on. We're leaving. Why? Mom, what's going on? Time to move on. Why? I can't believe I was actually starting to trust you. I still don't understand. What...? You stole every word I said to you, and worse, you ripped off the kids. Mom, what do you mean? We don't have stuff to rip off. I brought you these. Why did you tell him about foster care, Jake? You just put US in more jeopardy. I'm not going to turn you in. You would if it meant a best-seller! Cassandra, let's just talk this over, okay? You're a thief and you stole our lives! You said it was an important story. You said people needed to know what's going on on the other side of the equation. It didn't happen to you! It's not your story to tell. Yeah, but i... I'm not going back out there. Jake, this isn't our home anymore. That was just a dream. I belong here. Look, Jake and Vera, they deserve better than this. What is this? Your come-to-Jesus moment? You took your sweet time getting there, didn't you? No, I get it, you just need to copy down our story, because before we came along you had nothing, and then we stumbled into your life, and all of a sudden, you had a best-seller and you could save your precious house. Our house! Which you stole from US, because you had money, and we didn't. That is not the way it happened. Look. Jake and Vera deserve better. How dare you? Jake, you think Stewart cares about you? You're just a character in his book. He's using you, using Vera, using me, and every moment we ever lived! I'm not going. Jake, we're a family. We stay together no matter what. Mom, I don't want to go! You're just running away, Cassandra. Oh, you're one to talk. Go. Go! You know what? You're right, Stewart. All you'll ever be able to tell are other people's stories. Hello. Good god, Stewart. Where have you been? It's like you fell off the face of the planet. Yeah. It kind of feels like that. Okay, what did you write? I'm sorry. I was rushed, I wasn't in a great place to... Stewart, are you kidding me? Sarah loves it. She says that it's wonderful. She wants to publish more excerpts as a series. She does? Yes! And she wants to pay you a lot of money. Oh? I owe you an apology. I was beginning to doubt you, Stewart, and I'm sorry. Whatever you're doing, keep on doing it, finish the book, and the stolaseries is going to make it a guaranteed best-seller. Stewart? Yeah? That woman and those kids, uh... Is this something that I should know about? No. They're gone. Um... are you all right? Yeah. Get some rest. Just let me know if you're interested in having a bit of company. Okay? I will. Okay. Bye. Stewart? There you are! The front door was wide... What happened here? Apparently Cassandra didn't like my story. So... so why would she... Well, anyway, I found some of your old books and games, and I thought the kids might enjoy them. They're gone. What? I don't know... There's nothing I could do about it. Don't look at me like that, mom. I'm sorry, mom, but I got something I have to do. Yeah. Here, Vera, have one of these cough drops. Jake, where did you get that? Why, would you have bought it? Look. I have a little money, okay? I'm giving you half for emergencies only. Okay. Go! Just like old times, huh? We're not in a position to be proud. I miss Stewart. I'll get a job, I'll make a little money, and we'll move to another town. ♪ Surprise! Hey. A check! For... The excerpt. Oh! Yeah. Great. Well, I don't want to disturb the genius at work, and I got to get to work. Did you know that your voicemail is full on both your phones? Yeah, it's just, I've been, you know, hibernating with the writing... Well, if you decide that you want to take a break, there's this, uh, important cocktail party at 6:00 P.M., purple club. Sarah grimes is going to be there. I was hoping that you'd be my date. I don't know. Um... Stewart? Are we okay? Of course. I just... you know, had a lot happening lately. I'm kind of a mess. I'm not exactly date material. If you change your mind... I would love to see you and... Yeah, maybe we could talk? Yeah. Great. If I finish the outline of the book, i... I will come. Are you that close? That's... that's great. Um, maybe I will see you later. Yeah. Whether I finish it or not, okay, I will be there. Yeah? Thank you. Get back to work. No, I totally understand. So, in four days? Okay. All right. Well, thanks very much, then. -So? -Nothing right now. They told me to come back in four days, though. Did you believe them? "Come back never" is what they meant. How is it possible for you to be so grumpy 24 hours a day? Come on, sweetie. Let's get you some cough medicine. Thanks. Jake, stay with US. Yeah. He's here now. Come quickly. The police are on their way. Gotcha, kid! Don't touch him. Run, Jake! Run! The cops are coming! No, you don't. Mom! Run! Don't split up! Stewart! He's gone. Stay here. -Ange. - Find 'em yet, stew? Not yet, but I'm going by the bus depot. Okay. Okay, let me know. Last call for the bus to Toronto. Last call for the bus to Toronto... Bus to spokane leaves from bay 3. Bus to spokane leaves from bay 3. The bus to Portland leaves in 20 minutes. The bus to Portland leaves in 20 minutes. This is the last call for the bus to Portland. "Purple club, 6:00 P.M." Bingo! Stewart. You made it. Mwah. You rewrote the excerpt? I felt it needed some work. It was fine! No, not "fine." Simply divine. I just read it. The "Cassandra" character, the voice was so authentic. And bravo! I usually can't stand it when a man writes a woman's story, because it's so full of cliche and projection. You have made me do something I have never done. What's that? I'm holding the presses. It's being edited for printing as we speak. Stewart! Stewart! What? -You need to go right now! -Why? - ...Needs you. - What is it? Mom's in jail. -What? Okay. I got to go. -Right now! Okay. My white knight. He's always ready to save somebody. As long as it gets US another chapter. Where are they? Um, they're with Angelo and my mom. They're fine. Did you bail me out? Look, if I go to court, I will go to jail, I will lose the kids, and they will be in foster homes forever, so I need to get out of Seattle as fast as I can... you cannot keep running. Tell me, what I am going to do, then? What are my options? Stay. At my place. That way, you have a permanent address. And then what? You get your own place. I don't have money. I don't have a job. What you do have are the rights to the book. I had Cynthia sign them over to you last night. Why? Because. It's your story. I'm just a guy who got lucky enough to tell it. Well, every story needs a writer. Can we do it together? You and me? Together? We can give it a shot. And about the court and stuff, I, uh... My dad was friends with a judge. I'll call him. I think it'll be okay. Okay. How did you bail me out? You don't have any money. I took an advance against the excerpt. You bailed yourself out. Then I guess it's going in the book. Let me get that. Mom! Hi. Hi. Thank you. For what? For being such an amazing young man. I love you. ...tell me something I don't know. You got your car, Mrs. P, or you need a lift? -Well, i... -mom? I was kind of hoping you'd stick around today. I need your help. And you too, Angelo, because, uh, we're going to make pancakes. Oh, ho! You mean Mrs. P's super-secret pancake recipe? Oh, you kids are in for a treat. What can I do to help? Actually, you could help me out down at the bowling alley. I need someone. What do you say? A job? For real? A real job, work to do and everything. Benefits are so-so, but kids will bowl for free. Yes! Absolutely yes. When can I start? Tomorrow. I'm off today. Makin' pancakes. Did you say pancakes? I'm starving. Well, come on. Let's get started. There's a bowl. I want to help too! You bet.
