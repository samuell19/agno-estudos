'This isn't a learning disability or an eye sight problem' Her father heads the department in the college where my daughter studies What's the use of being popular among his students? A daughter like her is enough to ruin all that Every family will have a blotch like this If this continues, promotion to 8th grade is difficult You should get this signed by your father Mili, wait Don't let your hair get so dry Why don't you apply oil? It's full of dandruff Ask Sudha to bring some medicated oil from home Too late, she should be here by now We can buy tomorrow from a shop nearby Must be your aunt Go and see Open the door Mili, when did you come from school? Little while ago Shall I make tea for you? Just a little will do I met her school Principal today He feels the syllabus is difficult for her to cope with Next year we must shift her to another school I don't want, serve her Why don't we admit her in a school back home till she finishes her 10th? If it wasn't for her monthly check ups I'd have taken my sister-in-law with me With Nirmala and other family members around She'll automatically become cheerful If you put in a request to Sujatha teacher we can easily get admission next year at De Paul school I can bring her here every week Doubtful if we can get her into De Paul with her record We'll check Mary Matha or Sharada's school Just don't make things worse by pampering her too much My dear, I wasn't serious Don't be upset and sulk in there Sweetheart! Open the door Don't pamper her like this, Sudha Let her cry for sometime She'll eat later on It's tough when you make such a demand suddenly How can I shift you to another room? No one is prepared to adjust with each other these days We three always felt negative vibes in that room Marriage proposals don't come our way, let alone take off I must shift from here Only then good time will begin This is quite ridiculous! How can a room be blamed for lack of marriage proposals? Maximum demand is for your room in this hostel No other room is so spacious or with an attached bathroom If it is so much in demand why don't you give it? How can I trust newcomers? You are old occupants New girls may not be like you If you insist, I can shift one of you to D block Decide and tell me which one of you'll shift If that's the case, you know the 4th girl in our room? Just shift her from our room 4th girl...? You mean Mili? What's wrong with her? Don't think I'm cribbing about my job It's a job that's highly insecure Only if I start at 8:00 a.m, catch the bus, I can reach by 9:00 a.m But ever since Mili joined us my entire routine has gone haywire I can't even shower in peace She's inside the bathroom at 5:00 a.m She takes 3 hours to come out Open the door Mili But in case I get in first- Daily I go through a similar hassle too We go to bed after a tiring day at work You switch off the lights at 10:00 p.m for us to sleep But she never sleeps at night Wretched girl! Mili has a mental problem, teacher lfl get a call, she's all ears I first thought, it was all in fun I get messages from my fiance How canl ask him not to text me just because... ...someone else was reading them? She is a psycho "Mili is like the mimosa plant If touched, closes the next instant" "Little pearl, head to toe naughty Like a firefly is our Mili" "Blooming bouquet of leucas little white flowers on her lips" "Hesitantly" "Coral bead-like eyes blinking innocently Saunters softly slinking our girl, Mili" "Walks but not alongside typically Wafts like a breeze, our Mili" "Like a rainbow hued flower gaily she's a simple soul, our Mili" "Mili, in a crowd is always lonely Within each one of us is also a Mili" Nancy always advises me to wear contact lens But I always feel as if ants are crawling inside my eyes I can see through this quite clearly That must be a message from Renuka You are Renuka's roommate Can you give me her phone number please? To call her for a screen test When will you be back, Nancy? I'll be late Too many patients Are you at the apartment? I've given the key to the security Go in and be with mother I'll join you soon There's milk in the fridge Make some tea for mom, if possible Light tea, use sugar-free, okay? I'll try to be there in half an hour Okay, sis Hey! You look great Is it your birthday? If you dare say I got this for you our deal will be called off, okay? If I am caught, I'll betray you to Nancy - Enough? - Muah Are you making tea? Yes...why? Make it a bit strong I'm unable to relish the taste of milk Forget it! I know all these are excuses to make me add sugar Nancy has specifically told me to use sugar-free Oh this Nancy! You have added only 1 tab of sugar-free, isn't it? Don't harass me like this 1 tab sugar-free? Just you wait! I will get my son married His wife will then deal with this Problem isn't with taste It's your tongue Even if your son's wife comes from the US... ...this will taste just the same Thinks no end of herself! Did you have your tea? Why are you behaving like a pair of thieves? What is it, my girl? What the hell do you think you are doing? If you are planning to be hospitalized take her along to nurse you She isn't serious Give me that fried fritter Give it to me Hide it I'll be back soon So why this sudden visit today? Is it about your roommates? Or is it to do with love tangles? Arun looked at me today, once And? I don't know After that he didn't bother He just moved away Couldn't you look back at him? How can I with all those people around? I feel he's deliberately avoiding me Shall I talk to him? Hey! No Don't ever come here with such silly issues again Me? Tell me I was the one who sent a friend request to Arun It was me he accepted first In this group I'm his 1st friend Morons! Trying to snatch him away! I didn't say it was your call No No, yaar Not bad Goodness! If she had seen that message...?! It would've put me to shame She has started it again Inability to communicate doesn't mean less intelligence Are you here because you believe you are a loser? I don't think we are so unlucky as to deserve these insults If it is a kind of discrimination here... ...I am willing to leave At least one person believes in luck Maybe you'll join a new company Are you sure you won't face similar problems? After hopping in and out of several firms You'll buckle under pressure from family get married, have kids and continue with life Isn't that the only option you have? Understand that unless we agree, you won't be sacked This group, including Anupama was asked to attend this session... ...not for the lack of trust the management had on you The Spanish painter Picasso was once challenged by a very beautiful lady... ...if he could paint her picture in 1 minute Picasso did it in 30 seconds and the lady was stunned She was about to leave with the picture when Picasso mentioned its rate The lady, shocked asked why he wanted 1 million for a work of just 30 seconds? He replied 'it may be 30 seconds for you, madam' 'But it took me 30 years to do it in 30 seconds' Reason behind his reply was this Understand a person's skills before passing judgment We may meet many people who have gone through lot of negativity But convening the negativity into positive energy ls passion for one's work and belief in one's effort 'The harder I work the luckier I get' Don't forget this success mantra You must believe in that kind of luck Not like Anupama's negative pessimism But go about positively without fear Hello, sis? Just look at this! Madam, please don't raise this as a complaint in front of others Isn't it natural for kids to quarrel among themselves? That too inside the classroom When such things happen in the presence of teachers... ...do you want us to be quiet? Action has been taken against that student In unusual instances, a teacher may have noticed it a bit late Every movement is recorded in the classroom and still! I have lost my trust not only in the teacher But the school's efficiency also Giri sir has recommended many children to this school Can't you compromise without turning it into an ugly episode? If Giri is also involved it will turn more complicated Please don't do that I promise we won't have careless teachers in this school hereafter If you shift Nikhil now, the future of our school will be affected I hope you understand what I'm trying to say What if other parents also demand that their children are monitored? Didn't you see howl supported you to the maxim um extent? At this age when children need maxim um attention 'lfl dismiss you right away I'll also get into trouble' 'I can give you a month's notice' 'You can try elsewhere by then' 'I have no other option left' No complications But only the nurse is here Let me see I'll try to get back early Who has come with Joseph? Mathew sir had called Says ECG shows mild variations He doesn't expect any problems But wants an angiogram done She may have to stay overnight Did mom tell you anything specific? What is the use of asking someone who fusses over every little discomfort? Let the test take its course I must visit the clinic urgently and pick up my daughter too Will you be able to stay here for another 2 hours at least? Of course! I'll stay Take your time Here, keep this with you Nothing to worry, bro Mom has recovered from worse situations, right? She'll come out of this also She'll cajole you into buying food from outside Don't buy anything until the tests are over - Okay? - Fine I am leaving Go sit inside She's already jittery about tomorrow's tests Mili is there to add to it What more do we need? - Okay - See you I saw you going in Did you leave school early? - Yes -I thought as much She would have given you a distress S.O.S call, right? Sit, you can leave after a cup of tea I'll get some tea from the canteen So this was your intention, eh? While sharing problems a little sweet will help! What did you think? That if you didn't keep her happy like this, she will love you less? Mom knows you very well That's the reason for her phone calls and complaints Don't scold her I was feeling a bit low Sol helped myself from her bag She didn't get it for me Then she must have the guts to stop you from eating it Mom's illness can be cured with proper medicine But what you suffer from, can be cured only if you learn to say 'no' to people If relationships break due to that, just let it go An existence without any identity of your own and always petrified Take it easy, my child Don't take him seriously MBRHDRG "Somewhere, someplace" "Forgetting ourselves we move at our own pace" "There, here or anywhere" "We race along not knowing each other" "With desires various and thirst endless" "In search of a shore for safety we run through roads plenty" "Oh Time!

Come, doctor is calling Please sit That girl, your relative is waiting to see you If you are busy, we could have come for the late night show It is convenient for me also How can we leave mom alone at night? Neither can we take her along Her legs are not strong enough Won't the maid Vanaja come? Catch her staying! She stays only till 8:00 p.m Today I put in a special request We'll know once we get back Most probably she'd have given the key to the watchman This trip is just for you It's a great film, mom Did you plan something else for this evening, Mili? Mili, I was talking to you Sis?! Did you have anything else lined up for this evening? No Mili, can you take her to the restroom? Go ls Mili worried about something? What makes you think so? I don't know I just felt it As if she wants to confide in you Just wait and watch She won't go back to her hostel today She'll come straight back to your apartment Only there she can tell you Don't bother asking her We'll see how she handles it Let us go via the hostel we must drop off Mili No, drop me at the clinic My scooter is parked there Do you want us to let you ride back so late at night? Then I'll sleep at the apartment and leave early in the morning I'm not meeting the warden for this How are you involved in this? Didn't I tell you, sis? I tried my best to explain But she refused to listen I won't have anything more to say lfl keep running to solve your issues... ...you'll always fail in every walk of life Just once more, sis One last time, please It will be more complicated if I come Go straight to her and explain everything After all this isn't an orphanage And you are paying your fees regularly Only if you are aggressive they will cool down No need to go back to that room Those girls are not your kind We'll give you another room Upstairs are all studious girls They are all very quiet Moreover it's easier to adjust with the younger lot Teacher, stop being sentimental Single occupancy So there is space only for one cot Don't open that window One of the first regulations when this hostel took over This room is closest to the men's hostel next door If you feel uncomfortable just get someone to open the ventilators Or if you insist on sharing we'll go back downstairs This is fine She can stay here Let me go and draw up the papers You can sign them This is good enough When alone you will learn to be responsible "Apple of my eye, sweetie Won't you hum a song for me?" "My sugar cube, sweet honey Won't you sing a song for me?" "You behold a pan of God, don't you? You caress away my pain with love true" "You're my eye's vision Always in my horizon" "Apple of my eye, sweetie Won't you hum a song for me?" MBRHDRG Good morning...! These kids don't suit your temperament It's the age factor, you may find it easier to handle older kids, teacher Don't think I'm agreeing to this break-up Those people will surely insult me in front of our family members I can't forsake herjust because a proposal didn't work out, can I? Like any other father I also wanted to see my daughter happily married Away from my protection, I thought, she will become... ...more responsible in a new home and circumstances I don't deny that But instead of over protecting her let her work in a decent office A new job, new friends and responsibilities Even if she objects... ...you must make her understand She must learn to live alone in some city hostel My dear child Your work should be your first priority I have given your number to Nancy, an old student of mine She will be your local guardian It's been so long since we travelled together like this, isn't it? When you were little we used to go for walks You used to ask me to get you anything you saw and fancied But as you grew older you stopped asking me May be I was the reason A selfish father who wanted to see his child learn and master tough syllabus I don't know if you ever realized that When your mother was alive... ...she always asked me to find out About how you were coping The way you bonded with your friends There are some things only a father can ask his child But I was too cowardly I'm not at all happy leaving you alone like this I get more apprehensive, of what will happen when I leave this earth "You behold a pan of God, don't you? You caress away my pain with love true" "You're my eye's vision Always in my horizon" "You're my eye's pupil Always in my heart and soul" Yes Sure, ma'am Sweetheart? What happened, my dear? I don't want to be here anymore, father There was a problem I lost my job at the school I can't live alone, father Let me come home And what will you do here? I'll just be with you Don't come back just to be with me I refuse to stand by you on this If you've lost this job find a new one I have told you what I feel I don't want to see you if you don't have a job I have nothing more to say (Prayer) Did I ask her to do this? She behaved wilfully She just did it in a weak mental state But don't ever say I was the cause for this 'Renuka and I aren't in any relationship' 'This video message is just to clear that confusion' Sir, why didn't you tell me you were coming? After her call last night I couldn't wait any longer Why don't you go meet her? May be I can come along now No, my dear This isn't a casual visit lfl meet her now... ...howwill I go back leaving her alone? But what's the issue, sir? Is it because she was sacked from herjob? I don't believe she is an incompetent teacher The school authorities were also to blame This filtration is to give priority to their own people May be, but what if in some otherjob also... ...her performance is judged in the same way? Even though we speak on the phone daily... ...you hide many things from me and manage I know it isn't right to ask this of you But... ...if all fails, can you employ her here? Nothing big, just odd jobs Or maybe train her as a receptionist I'll myself pay you her salary every month With you around I need not worry about other issues I am unable to see her as a non-achiever She was running around playing all this while, Aby Suddenly she just dropped off to sleep Naveen has taken over the kitchen So dinner is bound to be late It's a typically local chicken curry With pepper and coconut milk Great! Why are you making my mouth water? What a lovely flavor! There sits the judge! With a little more spice and salt, it'll be perfect What if it takes time? No compromise on chicken curry Aby, what have you decided? Any changes in strategy? It's all uncertain I'm confident everything will be fine The research team will be decided in 2 days lfl am not in... I'll call you back later Chicken curry is ready! I found out something from her school discreetly Now herjob is terminated Don't let her know you are aware of it She hasn't told me anything Let us see if she can solve this problem by herself Sit straight, my girl Take your hands off your head Take some more Drop her off at the hostel, okay? Good that your spectacles broke You look good without it Why don't you manage like this? My sister told me you lost your job But how did she know? I know you haven't told her But your father knows, right? Probably he told her What are your future plans? Are you looking for anotherjob? Or planning to go back to your father? In Bharat matrimonial... ...I seem to have seen a familiar profile This is the best time Plenty of time No worries about applying for leave Your father must have started planning I must get a job at least for my father's sake Otherwise, I can't go back home Job It shouldn't be just for the sake of working However small, it must be something you enjoy doing Any father will accept a daughter with that attitude it was your father who identified my sister's efforts He saw that she yearned for something more than graduating Won't he expect the same from you? Inna ...I didn't have such ...an aim in life Have you ever wondered why? Have you ever taken a decision without your father or Nancy being involved? If I leave you alone here tonight... ...who will you call? Your father? Or Nancy? When they are around you you think you are safe But it is only an illusion If one day, they stopped responding... ...you will be completely shattered, won't you? Aren't you going to answer? Father...I'll call him later Is it because you can't talk with me sitting beside you? Of course not He'll ask if I've reached my hostel safe and sound Don't worry We won't be late Just like you cut that call... ...will you be able to cut your comfort zone for some days? I know it isn't that easy There will be frustrations and disappointments in the beginning But once you cross that stage it'll be difficult to hold you back Why are we back here? Did you feel any relief from the talk we had? Afear caused by a cut I saw on your hand I'm not asking if it was an accident or deliberate But I hesitate to leave you alone tonight and go away You share the smallest of life's incidents with Nancy... You can easily share this also You will be even more relieved than what you feel now How can I explain all this to her? Don't worry, by the time you take the lift to the 11th floor... ...I'd have briefed Nancy Be brave Okay, I'll call you back I understand Have you told the hostel you won't be back tonight? Tell everyone concerned without getting them stressed out Why didn't you answer your father's call? He called me saying he was unable to reach you Go on, tell him yourself Here, it's ringing Do you see the lights are still on in some flats so late at night? If you watch carefully, you'll see there are kids crying from them They don't sleep at nights My Irene too was like this as a baby When I was busy with my career I didn't get anyone to look after my baby Afew of us facing similar situations came up with a bright idea Look at that recreation area An independent day care area for the children of this place alone But the question was who will be there for that job Mili, to get over this phase just be convinced and commit yourself That will be- Kids have only increased in number All we have to do is put our idea into practice Tell me you are willing I'll talk to the concerned people But day care responsibilities"? I'll support 11°" And it isn't for free You'll get paid enough to sustain yourself I'll need a project report to present to them You want me to prepare that too? No, I'll do it myself I'm getting married on the 17th of next month In my home town Everyone here will attend You must come too Tara? She agreed to all this based on my promise Whatever the decision don't delay in saying it, please I know you won't recommend a person without credibility But they want a person who is a mother also Let me talk to the members of the association I'll give you my feedback As far as I know, she hasn't got a single friend she can confide in The only way to make her come out of this depression... ...is some positive space That's what she needs Don't you have friends in your circle who can provide that? So that she is somehow or the other she is amidst us I can try But first of all... Leave that to me In such a situation, I won't let her be alone If you can accommodate her, Anupama It'll be a great support to me and her family I thought of many options to eliminate this isolation But I don't think I have a better choice than you, Anupama It's good to hear such words But... ...will it end up as a headache?

I don't fit in here What about the new day care? You'll lock it up? Will you say this to Nancy who went out of her way to convince families there?

An it ha, it's o kay What if she falls sick being fed by maids? Anju dear? Just look who it is? Yes lam sure Even otherwise complaints have started trickling in I'll call later What is it? Anitha's son is only 2 years older than Anju She gave her a spoonful of rice from what she brought for her son I don't know the number of bacteria in what she fed But I know one thing for sure Every spoonful rice she fed was filled with mother's love We must teach him a lesson And you must be the one to do it I can't do such things, okay?! I'll drop down in fear Remember how many nights he kept you awake? - Come, come - No, please - Come on -I am afraid So finally you learnt to say 'no' I did n't think I could But he is a total flirt I was such a fool So it was for a stupid flirt you kicked up such a fuss Thanks for giving me new friends They care for me so much Really?

Wait here I'll bring the car It's the association's decision We must open only after informing them We never expected a problem this early But neither can we treat some of the incidents as silly issues This play school was approved because it was exclusively for us But kids from other blocks have also been accepted Not only that You don't follow the play area's restrictions We are concerned about the safety of kids who run out in the open We need at least 3 people to help take our parked vehicles out We never know from where kids will appear If we take care of these issues can't we continue, Sharath? I didn't mention the noise pollution factor Panicker sir is a senior citizen here Since he has also complained we are planning to shut it down What will happen to the kids? We have 10 days We have to look out for some other place Both the kids and me Why don't you talk to your husband? It's of no use I didn't come to speak for Sharath I came for Mili's sake Why don't we take a collective opinion? They form the majority Even if we go in for votes, what is the % of families with kids? About 20% Much lesser Let's keep it at 20 If we have a meeting, how many do you think won't respond? 35 -40 % won't attend They don't have time for such issues Why not consider the remaining people? What do we gain from that? Even if we get support, the issues that were raised can't be solved They are kids I find it difficult to shut them up in closed rooms Mr Panicker must come back to sit in his balcony Kids and I shouldn't be a hindrance to that When you come for the 1st time you might feel it's a bit too far Tell me at least now what's happening? That's where our board 'wonder kids' will be, bro You must tell them that They won't mind it They'll even compromise on rent But they won't budge on the advance Let's set aside loans and mortgages as a last option What else can we do? Why don't we conduct a fund-raising event? Event? With who? Talented kids from Mili's day care center How can we conduct an event at such short notice? What about the sponsors...?
