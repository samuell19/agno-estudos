Bambino, Bambino... do not cry, Bambino With eyes cast to the ground, a sad expression and pale cheeks... You don't sleep anymore, Just a shadow of your former self. Alone you're roaming the streets like a soul in distress. And every night beneath her window You come to serenade her. I know how much you love her, She has the most beautiful eyes. But you're still a bit too young To be playing a pair of lovers. So play, play, play on your mandolin My little Bambino... Your music is more beautiful Than all the skies of Italy. And sing, sing, sing with your lovely voice My little Bambino... You can sing as much as you want, She'll never take you seriously. With your hair so blond, You're like a little cherub... Now boys, listen to me carefully. There's a lion outside and he bites. You mean there's a lion on the loose? How is that possible? ALGERIA TO THE FRENCH For peace in Algeria, vote for the Communist Party. So Daddy, where's the lion? Right there...across the road. Can't you see it? He's big, he's strong, he's majestic. That lion's not even real. It's just a heap of iron. DEATH TO THE ARABS Don't even look, straight ahead. Come on, keep going... Documents please...Algerian? - Yes. Name, date of birth.... -Barbier. September 2, 1924. -And your address... DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ST. VINCENT DE PAUL HOSPITAL Mr. El Matten, if you would follow me. Boys, your dad will come with us, so say goodbye to him. There. Abdel, Messaoud. We have no other choice. Your mother's in the hospital, she's very sick. I work day and night at the factory. So, until she recovers, You must be strong. You're not going to leave us, Dad. We want to stay with you. Abdel, you are the oldest. You must be an example to your younger brother. It's not complicated... From now on, you must do as the French boys do. Messaoud, your name means good luck. It was my father's name. Rest his soul. Take this. He will protect you from evil. You, you have one already. Someday, our country will be free, and we will return home. Long live Algeria. Daddy! Daddy!...Daddy, don't go! Don't leave us. What's this crying? We're from the mountains. We're Kabylians. And Kabylians don't cry. We keep everything inside. Hey, you...back in your bed, and not a peep! You must understand... you can't always sleep with your brother. So better get used to it. Please, sir...let him stay. I don't want to be parted with him. Dad promised he'd come back and take us home to our country. Your country...right...in the meantime, devote yourself to not waking the others. Goodnight! You better sleep! You'll see, you'll love it in the country. And the people are really friendly. Hop on! Good morning, Mrs. Duvalier. - Good day, Mrs. Marshall. - Would you come with me. Please, have a seat. First off, I must tell you...the mother of the boy we will assign to you was committed to a psychiatric hospital due to a nervous breakdown. But, after numerous exams, we discovered she had leukemia. Oh, the poor woman, that's terrible. You know, treating this type of illness can be a lenghty process. ...or even any hope of a cure. As for the father, he can't take care of him anymore, so... chances are, that boy might be in your care for quite a long time. - Shall I bring him in? - By all means. Come with me. You will live on a farm, You'll see, you'll love it. Sit down. - That's him? - You can review his file: his French passport, vaccination certificate, school records... He's a French Muslim? Something wrong? He's a little Arab. This just won't work. His parents are indeed from Algeria, but he's just as much French as you and me. He was born in Aubervilliers. Isn't that right, sweetie? Yes, I'm from Auber. It's just like Paris. There's even a subway at the city gates. Return to your brother now, young man. You know very well my husband was in the military. If we take in this child, with all the colonial wars... What is she like, your new nanny? She seems really nice, but I don't think she likes Arabs very much. I don't care, I'm a Frenchman. I was born here! Pighead, you're not French! Me...looks like they're sending me on a farm. I don't like farms. You can always refuse him, but it's the third one you turn down, Mrs. Duvalier. There will not be a fourth... You will not find another little Pierre. Refusal after refusal, we'll stop calling you, plain and simple. Want to see him again? Sure... Alright, I'll take him. Besides, we don't have much choice. We need the money to make ends meet. Look, Mrs. Duvalier...for your sake... Better a child like him than no child at all. Cheer up, Giselle. You shouldn't worry. Everything will be all right. Thank you. And, don't forget... ...show him only a bit of affection, not too much love. It's the golden rule. - He's your brother? - Yes, ma'am. Then say good-bye to him. We have to go. Why do you look at me all the time, madam? Because you have beautiful eyes. Look, I brought you some dried fruit. They're really good. Especially the quince, my favorite....come on. Wait for me here, young man. Giselle! Well, this is a surprise! Haven't seen you in years. Monique, please get me some dye. You know, Brillance, the brand I used to buy. You're right. Men really go for it. And it's back in fashion. I need as much as possible to bring back to the house. You know, I saw Maurizio on the Grands Boulevards in Paris. How much? Come on, baby, the bus is about to leave. We don't want to be late. Come on! Giselle! Is this boy yours? He's his son? Don't start any rumours. I got him through social services. You don't want to catch cold. We're going to the countryside... ...back home, doctors don't come cheap. But ma'am, I look like a girl. No, no...look, that's a pretty horseshoe. It's a cowboy scarf. Just keep it on until we get home. Then, we'll see. Smells nice, really nice. Well, here we are. We're home. You'll be living here, now. Which window is ours, ma'am? What do you mean, which window? The whole house is ours! Look, your room is up there, right under the roof. Come on, baby. How fortunate! You wear the same size as Pierre, he's the boy I had just before you. Come on, turn around. Careful of the foam, it can burn your eyes. Ok, turn around... and make sure you keep this towel on. What time is it? Just enough time to dress you before Georges comes home from work. Madame, and who is Georges? Georges is my husband. You'll see, he's special. He can get angry at times. Now, let's think of a new name for you. He's not very fond of Arabic names. Actually, in these parts, nobody does. My name is Messaoud. My mom gave me that name. It means happy go lucky. Lucky, hey... Well, if you want to be happy, you must forget your dad, your mom and your brother. As for your name... What? You tickled me, madam. We'll call you Michel. - Agreed? - No. Why not? You don't want us to love you? You want people to hurt you? Decide... Okay, then. You can call me Giselle or even... Gisou. So there... ...you now have entered the realm of the Saints. Are you pleased? This will be our secret. - Do you believe in God? - Yes. But it's the god of the Arabs... - Well, it's Allah! Well from now on, you'll believe in the god of the Christians. In any case, I'll teach you the Sign of the Cross. In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Now, your turn... Just the Sign of the Cross, not the finger gesture. Do you eat pork? I heard Muslims do not eat it. - Pork is pig meat? - Yes. - Oh no, I don't eat pigs. - Not even a bite? Absolutely not! That's a shame, because the price... ah, never mind, I'll find a way... Now, Messaoud, fetch me those shoes. We'll see if they fit you. I'm confused, now. What's my name? Michel or Messaoud? Well done! I can see you're a fast learner. If anyone asks, you tell them you're from the north. Your dad worked at the mine and one day... one day... he never came back. He's dead? No! But he was seriously wounded, and can't take care of you anymore. Understood? And now, my Michou, let's try those shoes. Oh, they're a little too big... ...but with these thick socks, you will be able to wear them. Quick! hide under the table! And remove the towel! I have a surprise for you, my dear! - What the hell? - Close your eyes. Well, what! It's not my birthday; it's not St. Georges day. What's to celebrate? Close your eyes... I went to the shelter and met with the director of social services. Alright, you can open your eyes, now. Well, what do you say? You were swindled. He's a bit strange. Look at that head. He's as skinny as a stick! We'll fatten him up. Sure we will... He looks like a bird with a yellow tuft. -What's your name? -Michel. Well, let him answer! Did he swallow his tongue or something? What's your name? My name is Michel, sir. You're scaring him. He came from the north. His father was seriously injured, working in the mines. Madame Giselle calls me Michou, my Colonel. Colonel? Hell... Promoting me Chief Warrant Officer to Colonel... that will never happen! Give him a tour of the premises. And be nice to him, okay? Does he have a coat? Yes, that one! Alright, let's go. You see this patch, you cannot walk in that area. Understand? Over here, we have tomatoes... over here we have some cabbage... Over there is a plum tree. But you can't climb it. The branches might break and you'll hurt yourself. And over there is the pigsty. We call him Totoche. And who is this gentleman? Him? That's Paul. He's a bit of a moron, a numbskull. Like you, he stays with us, but he sleeps over there, under the porch. He's as dumb as a log but as strong as a bull. Listen up! This is Michel. You must be really nice to him or else you'll have me to deal with. Yes, boss! See that? Come, I'll show you the rabbits. The rabbits are strictly for me. Is that understood? Yes....hmm... boss! Good! You want to pet a rabbit, you ask me. Got that? you ask me. Here... Come on, pet it, don't be afraid. He's cute, no?. He wants to play. In any case,... You'll have to work hard. I have to work? You know, in this day and age, only deadbeats die of hunger. On top of that, you'll go to school. And since you're pretty bright, so much for the best. Little Pierre wasn't much bigger than you, but he was a workhorse. As for his schooling, well, just wasn't for him... But you... you'll go to college later on. That's for sure. You'll go to college and who will give thanks to who? Who? Who will you thank? Well Georges, of course! Thank you. No, no, not now...later. Alright, come on. Watch this... and...Abracadabra! My father never had a car. Be a good boy. When your dad is not around, you forget about him. Rule number one. Agreed? Otherwise, we'll not get along you and me. That was then, this is now. That's how it works, here. And rule number two? What number two? Rule number one: I don't have a dad anymore. So what's rule number two? It's try not to be a smart ass. Let's go. Let's make some noise. Great set of wheels, don't you think! Come on my beauties. Let's get a move on. Come on, Leela! Take your time, Viguier Take your time... That scumbag... He's deliberately blocking the road with his stupid cows. He was an informant during the war. The shame of all shames. You hear me? Watch yourself... Careful...come, this is the most beautiful boutique you'll ever see. Well, what did I tell you? She's beautiful, no? The boutique. Ah, no,no, Michou. Never put the cart before the horse. When you get to know all the secrets of the Sergeant Major's pen, then we'll see. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, Mademoiselle. Tell me, how much for that satchel? 240 francs. I'll take it. 240 francs... It has shoulder straps, too. Oh my! your stepladder is rather shaky. You should tell your boss to get a new one. Sorry about that... There you go, Little Michou. Isn't that a great satchel? What do you say? Thank you, Georges. I love it. Let's get a drink. We deserve it. I'm as thirsty as a camel. Drinks are on me! I'd like you to meet my new boarder. You see this bar? This countertop? If it could talk it would tell you a story or two. Right, Albert? He's heard some juicy ones. And then some...but don't get me started on that... We won't go there... This is Max. A real buddy of mine. We served in Indochina together. Right, Corporal? That was long ago, Sgt. How you doing, kid? So....Duval... Cat got your tongue? He's not dumb, but almost. He's part of the furniture. One day he went on a hunting trip. Since then, not a peep. You'd think someone had cut his balls off... Okay, listen up! I want you to meet Michel...we call him Michou. He's a kid from the north. He's a little Schti. Yes, I am little. He's got quite a headset your lad... Can't make out if he's a boy or a bird. Don't mind him. Canaries brighten my day. What shall we serve your lad, a lemonade? Yes, perhaps. Best of all, it's on the house. Here, Michel, I've got some bottle caps for you. When you get a bike, you can decorate the wheels. Thank you. Well, we gotta baptize the squirt. Serve him a glass of red at least! Mind your fucking business, Viguier. We know your son was brought up in that shit! Oh...you want to see how it works... You'll see, Good Old Georges was the king. When I was younger, they called me Bobby... Bob Le Chataigne. - Go ahead, Georges.... ...imagine you're bashing the snout on that Italian... a certain Maurizio! Viguier! See this? Next time, I'll blow your brains out like a watermelon!. Since you broke it, so must pay for it. You should get to know your own strength. We should maybe fix the jukebox. That way we'll have music to calm things down a bit. Make yourself at home while you're at it. That one's going on your tab. Come on, Michou, we're leaving. What's his name? What's your name? Look around, man, you're crashing here. You sleep up there, top of the ladder. Tomorrow, we get up at five. Go! What? You've been had. So what... So what? You've been had. It was just after the war, When this little ballroom had suffered, On a road to misery, Two lovers could be seen Dancing in the rubble. And they called this little ballroom... Oh, I forget, I forget, I forget... No, I can't remember the name of the lost ballroom. All I remember are the lovebirds, Without a worry in the world. Amid their carefree ways, and their emotional embrance, Why worry about the name of a small lost ballroom? No, I can't remember the name of the lost ballroom All I remember are the lovebirds, With only love in their eyes. And that was nice... And that was nice... Is this a time to come home, Georges? A child must eat at regular intervals! You've been drinking again. You went to the Cafe. But I told you not too... ...especially with the kid! You should be ashamed. It's my fault, Madame Giselle. I wanted a tour in the car. And then we went shopping for some school supplies. Come on, let's get you some supper. You have to get up early tomorrow. You're not in bed? Don't allow Georges to lead you astray. He's not taking you back to the Cafe. Here you go. Each week, you'll get a small allowance. You'll be able to buy candy or comics. Can I get Mandrake, the Magician? Sure you can... Pierre would always get Blek le Roc. He must have had quite a collection in the closet. But now, you must get some sleep. You have a long day ahead. Good night, my sweetie. He can't sleep... Georges.... Georges? Good night to you too. Messaoud El Matten... My husband, you see... with a name like that, it wouldn't work. I must change it. I have no choice. The people around here, you know what they're like. They will hate him and life will unbearable for him...and for us. Giselle, you know we wouldn't let you down. You're also aware of my opinions, how could I say no? But in this case... what you are asking is rather serious... complicity in the establishment of a false identity... I found a name for him. Michel...Michou. It's almost like Messaoud. You think so? And that's only his first name. For the full name, it would have to really sound French. DuPont? Durand? Where are you from, young man? Me? ... Auber. - From Auber? - From Aubervilliers. There you go! Michel Daubert... Just remove the apostrophe and add a ''t''. That way, you won't forget it. I told him that he came from the north. Very well, then. Now, fill in this form, I'll make a copy... ...and in case of any problem, you won't risk very much... ...and I can always play innocent. Agreed. Take my chair. I know there are Algerians with red hair, but blond like that... His blond hair is my fault. I dyed it myself. Well, I'll be... Tell me, you did well in school? Your grades were good? He's a smart boy. Let's try a little test. All of it? Then multiply the result by three. This is a list of supplies he will need.. Thank you... Hurry up, Mr. Lenay is waiting. Yes, well... Hopefully, his spelling... Spelling? That's what I'm really good at. Well...we'll see about that later. I must call the end of the recess. You stay right here, my boy. Be good. Today we have a new pupil. His name is Michel Daubert, and he comes from the north. Please give him a warm welcome. Repeat after me, altogether: Welcome, Michel Daubert. Welcome, Michel Daubert. Very good. Michel, you will sit in the front row, facing me. Eric Viguier, find a new seat close to the radiator; that should keep you happy. Keep in mind I will still have you in my sight. Now, take out your manuals on civic responsibilities. The theme for today is... One person's freedom... ...ends where another person's freedom begins. Michou, you're not going to do like Georges and watch that bloody TV all day. You're lucky, not everybody can receive the signal in our township. In the meantime unfold your napkin. Here Georges, a nice sausage, just the way you like it. Two... Hand over your plate. And what's that in his plate? Duck. I had one jar left. He must try your preserves. He can try that later. First, the sausage. It's okay, I prefer... hmmm...duck jam. Let him alone with your cochonaille. Cochonoye! Here, try this. This is Arthur. Next time you see his friend outside You say hello. His name's Totoche. At this table, we don't renounce pork. Come on, eat! Taste it. That's it... You must learn to savor. Because we can't have Arthurs all the time. There's not much left. Hey! In this house, when you leave the table, you ask to be excused! You got him all upset with your sausage. It's the mustard. Kids hate it. He's throwing up! What did he vomit, what did he vomit? You'll need to build up an appetite, my boy. Father Georges has in mind to cook you some boar. Then we can talk. Don't worry, Michou. First of all, hunting season is not open yet. And Georges is overweight. I had to alter all of his trousers. Quiet! Stand at attention! Attention! Attention! And while the rebels who dream of becoming tyrants... invoke as an excuse for their actions the decision I have made about Algeria... let it be clear and known everywhere... Stand at attention... straighten your hand. ...that I will not recant on that decision. To yield on this issue and under these conditions, would mean burning the assets we still have in Algeria, with the result of reducing France to a dislocated toy on the high seas of adventure. Once again, I call on all French people whatever they are, wherever they are, to rally to the nation of France. Vive la R?publique! Vive la France! At ease.... The General is right. The time is now. The communists created this mess... Heck, the Liberation Front... They're all communists. Enough already...you stand there politicizing in front of a TV set when you can't even make it onto the Mayor's roster. Give it a rest... You would rather rant about foreign policy, than sweep the dust from your own front door.! Enough. You're over your head. We'd still be in Indochina if it weren't for the Reds. Eat! I 'll be right down,wait. What are you doing here? Did you run away or something? Just had to see you. How did you find me? I found your profile on the principal's desk. I read it when she went to the bathroom. What's with the hair? You look like a girl! What a stinker! Don't tell anyone. She didn't want her husband to find out I was Arab. And you... what will you do when people find out who you really are? There will be a price to pay... I don't care! They treat me a a slave, like an animal. They make me sleep in a chicken coop. I don't smell like rosewater, you know. Remember Daddy's words. We must do everything as he said. You're lucky he doesn't see you like this. He would disown you. Have you no shame? I'll come back for you. And we will run away together. Next time you must be ready...on a moment's notice! For now, let's pretend we don't know each other. It's better that way. I have to go back... Here, take this. It's for you. Berthot, well done: 8 out of 10. It's the highest mark. Boucher... not as good as the last time...4 You need to pay more attention to accents. Viguier... Above average this time. You're making progress. Keep it up. Daubert... Daubert, I don't know what school you've attended, but this is a disaster. I gave you 2 out of 10 but you deserved a flat zero. You mixed up the word secousse (tremor) with the word couscous. For you, a big secousse is the same as a big couscous! In the north, we all know, they're all morons! - Moron, moron! - Quiet! Quiet! Shall I take out your report cards? Blondel... Instead of polar icecap, you wrote pull her knee cap. Silence! Garcin, you've got nothing to brag about... The capital of France : the Eiffel Tower. Now...I don't want to hear a sound in the classroom. And the next one who makes fun of Michel Daubert will have me to deal with. How'd it go? He is extremely attentive. But, as far as his grades go, it is catastrophic. He'll have to work even harder at home because... even with all of these classes, he won't pull through. By the way...I have a book for you ...as promised. Albert Camus. THE STRANGER Novel It's high literature... Yes, but the writing is so simple and moving. It should peak your interest. And then, we could talk about it. Thank you. Men don't cry. Now, now...come on. Wipe your tears. There... Don't cry. I'll never make it. Don't say that. You can do it. You know, in school, I wasn't any better at first. Father Georges will drill you. He'll teach you how to write, to write well. In the end, they won't call you Michou. They'll call you Victor Hugo. Alright, dip your pen. There, in the inkwell. Let me see the question... What is the question? May I have a look? A train departing from Chateauroux and arriving at Argenton... Your husband brought me the good news this morning. So this is our rare bird? Nice to meet you, my boy. Good day. My name is Michel Daubert. No apostrophe. I'm 9 and from the north. At least he's straightforward! You've landed a good nest. Since you just arrived, you'll need to register for catechism. What grade are you in? We'll see about that later. Everything in order? First Communion, confession, all of that? Father, we need to talk. Jeanne... - Could you go tidy up my room? - Very well, Father. - The kid is Arab. - From the mountains... - Well.... - I am! But blond like that, it's unusual. Actually... not blond either. I dyed his hair. Oh my... But at least he's not Muslim...? No, I don't think so. - And your husband, where does he stand? - He knows nothing. Oh la la! I panicked, wanting to do the right thing... I spoke with Monsieur Lenay. He said that... Monsieur Lenay, Monsieur Lenay! He believes in neither God nor Devil, Mr. Lenay! This problem does not fall under his jurisdiction. You... you believe in that? In God and the Devil? Do you believe? Well, that's a start... I figured, during the war, you did take in Jewish children. Well, wartime was wartime. This is not the same thing. On the other hand, I have written my share of baptism certificates... All right. Does this bird sing? You have a good voice?...fit for a choir? That will do...thank you... And Easter, Easter... You're familiar with Easter, right? Lent, fasting... Of course, it's Ramadan. Listen, just send him to me for catechism, and I'll see what I can do... But, hmmm.. honestly.... I have a mass in one hour. You look spellbound... Another who-dunnit, no doubt. Hopefully you'll turn the light out, before you find out the killer's name. No, it's a real book. It's literature. Albert Camus. The Stranger. Such nonsense... As if they'd come knocking on our door these strangers... At times, I feel like there's one in my bed, actually... with the amount of affection I get from you... Well, now... Be nice and turn out the light, Mrs. Egghead, I have to work tomorrow. Praise be to Allah. Small Delights Bazar. What do you want? We'd like 130 francs' worth of firecrackers. Michel, get out some money, we'll have a blast. I don't have any. What? Your lady doesn't give you any money? - I lost it. - Don't lie to me... I swear! Blondin...spit it out. Always the younger ones that pay... Listen up. Monet over there. Michou and Victor will play the Arabs, okay? All right. I never liked them anyway. I'd rather play cowboys and indians. Come on, Victor, we're going on a stakeout. Then we'll scalp them. Good evening, Giselle. He's not here. I didn't have him this evening. I know. I had a few errands and thought I might meet him on the way home. He's probably at home already. He's really bright, you know. He's dedicated... He's fortunate to be here... ...because Paris is really restless. Any idea where his father is? What he's up to? No, not at all... why? There has been yet another illegal demonstration.... rallying thousands of people in favor of self-determination. With casualties. - We saw nothing of that on TV. - Of course. Censorship. What a tragedy. I think we should leave them their country. I haven't found the time to read your book. No worries... I started reading, but... But? I'm afraid. Afraid? Afraid of what...? Of grasping any of it. You said it was a nice book, but I find it sad. I can't identify with the main character, who he is, what he wants... You'll think I'm stupid, now. You want my opinion? I find you sincere, which is rare nowadays... I also find you clever, because that is precisely what the author wanted to convey. We shouldn't identify too quickly with this character. He's intriguing, but he never quite gets under your skin. Intriguing, yes...that he is... I've also wondered what a woman like you is doing here, in this village. Oh my God, I'm babbling, here. I must be on my way. See you on Friday! The schooling...Friday... In every village there is a postman That everybody loves you understand... For he might carry a letter or two That says: This one is for you! That is what creates the spark And why dogs just love to bark! Everyone chants so merrily... Here comes Mr. Postman In uniform he does look smart He carries letters for your heart. Here comes Mr. Postman... Good natured like his morning smile... So how did you score, my Michou? - Four. - Four? Sauteed...you wrote it with two ''t''s...? No, there's only one ''t''. Are you sure? How quaint. Guess I was wrong. And the word paddle has 2 ''d''s Two ''d''s in paddle? That's funny. We'll see about that! Alright, hop in. Can you sometimes tell a lie, Georges? No. Well... depends on the circumstances. Sometimes, in extreme situations... Only, never try to fool Old Georges, you hear? Absolutely. I asked, because we need to write an essay on lying. Really? Generally speaking, lying is a serious matter. But lying to Georges is worse. The only thing you can lie about is where babies comes from. Understood? And when it comes to that, sometimes you must lie about it! But don't mention any of this in your essay. Just keep that to yourself. Come, come my friend. That's a good rabbit. You're such a cutie. Hey! You can't touch the rabbits! Only Georges can handle them. If you want to make Pau-Paul happy and show him your TV... I'll show you a treasure. A pirate's treasure. And where is that treasure? Pau-Paul knows, but you must first swear to turn on the TV. I promise. This is the treasure. You know what it's for? - It's for the assthetician. - What kind of beast is that? For the girls, dumb-dumb! The sluts you have to pay, get it? And now, can we watch TV? Okay, but we must be quiet... Careful, Georges is sleeping. This evening he drank a whole bottle. At this hour, he's on a dream trip. I hope so, for everyone's sake. He if wakes up, he'll explode. That's your TV? But there's nothing on...you promised me! Of course there is! It's snow! And General De Gaulle is caught in a storm. I won't say anything, but I did see you this evening with another boy... a certain Abdel... Hush up. Don't say a word about this, I'll find you some American cigarettes. This weekend? Sure, this weekend. And next time, we can watch together Thierry La Fronde. I promise. Because my TV is in here. I see a nude woman, completely naked... with hair right here, and right there. Quiet, now. I hear noises. Go, go to bed. Every since you got your car, Georges, we don't see you walking anymore. You're so right, Robert. The world is changing. And it's not over yet. Here, this letter's for your mother. And this one's for you. It's from your son. Seems he's still stationed in Oran. Yep, looks like he's on Shore Leave. Jean-Baptiste...it's been a while since you last saw him. The hard part will be when he has to go back...anyway... Say... if ever he comes home, I'd be happy to see him. And what would make me happy, would be for you to stop reading our mail! Some day, your higher-ups will find out and you'll be in hot water. No one in the village wants to cause you any trouble... but sooner or later some idiot will come along and he won't be as lenient! A girl had lost both her parents And was left to herself as an orphan She had neither nickle nor dime, The girl was so poor all the time. Long ago, she did have parents But they never payed her any mind So much that this poor child Was nicknamed The Stranger She found a job selling postcards... Not a word. If you see any snitches, We're done for. Hand over the dough. - Hands-up! - You crazy? - I want to see it. - No. I paid for it! I know how to shoot, you know. Georges taught me. Come see this... they're Arab ears. It's a war necklace. Duval puts it around his neck when he goes on a Rab hunt. What's a Rab hunt? Hunting down a mortal enemy, like Sand Rats, Rac-Coons and Arabs. That goes on, here? Of course it does. My dad's even their leader. Not a peep out of you. Otherwise, they'll cut your balls off. You're really sick, you know. I'm getting out of here. You've got nerve! I'm in here... How was school? It was great! Let me see... Oh darn, some roots are sprouting. We'll have to dye them again. Giselle! Giselle! Giselle! Is Georges doing to die? Don't be silly. He's just very sick. He's come down with malaria. He was bitten by a big mosquito... when he was over there fighting in Asia, in Saigon. Ah yes, in the land of elephants. Like the pictures in the living room... That's right. Now, be a good boy and stay with him while I fetch Mrs. Lurcat. Well I hope Georges doesn't start acting strange. Well, that wouldn't surprise me. No, my Captain! Yes, my Captain! No sir! There are women and children and some elderly. - I can't! I won't! - Georges! I don't want any of the money. It's cursed! Oh my God! Oh my God! Giselle. He's gone mad! Take my life, my Lord! Just take it! I can't go on like this! No, Georges, don't say these things. I need you, Georges! Hang in there, Georges. I brought Madame Lurcat. Just let her do her thing. Come on... Take me! Take me! Take me! I address the Devil within this body: I command you in the name of Jesus, the one true commander and ruler in both heaven and earth ; whoever you may be, I command you to leave Georges's body at once. In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. I address the Devil within this body. I command you in the name of Jesus, the one true commander in both heaven and earth ; whoever you may be, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ, Leave this body of Georges. I hereby command you... (Spoken in Arabic) Listen, Giselle... When he gets up, let him get some sun. For now, let him sleep. Thank you. How much do I owe you? Nothing... I didn't do much. It's the kid that will heal him. Get him a nice toy, he'll be very happy. What happened? You're were delirious all night. You really had us scared. I thought we'd lose you for good. What's this? It belongs to the kid. He performed a healing with it. He saved your life, if that makes you uneasy. Madame Lurcat was there. She saw it. Madame Lurcat? God... - Where is the kid? - At school... You cheated. Give me back my soldiers, you moron. Sore loser! I won them fair and square. Besides, they're useless. They have no weapons and they're all broken. You are a miserable mutt. You and your brother Abdel. We know all about him, even if you have different names. I have no brother. I'm an only child. My father's name is Georges Duvalier. He's in the military and is very powerful. He could have you arrested. So leave me alone. Go and get Monsieur Lenay. He's a B?ni-oui-oui! The first one who touches my son again... I'll blow his brains out! You got that, shit-heads! Come on, Michou, We're going home. Back inside, everyone! Secrets and Spells of the War in Indochina. New line. The brigadier concluded... Brigadier concluded... His topo.... Topo is t-o-p-o... It's a technical term, used in military jargon. Topo. T-o-p-o... In the darkness... comma... Niakway --Niakway is interesting because Niakway is actually spelled N.h.a.q.u.?.s N.h.a.q.u.e.s.....Nha-Qu?s. Very interesting... The rebels... --rebels in plural form-- Were estimated in the millions...plural. An army of ants, terrified of tigers and genies, --Genies as in 1001 Nights, you see. Genies with an ''s''. End of quotation. The attacks! --with two ''t''s. were relentless... and unceasing. You torturing him. It's late. Can't you see he's tired! He's not tired. He's passionate about this. Aren't you, Michou? I'm not tired. All right. The Viets... --capital V... swarmed... --there were millions of Viets, so-- swarmed... the slopes... Colon : open the quotation. Doc-lap! Doc-lap! Doc-lap! Doc-lap! Exclamation mark! Doc-lap! That's Vietnamese, you see. It means independence They cried out, they cried out : Doc-lap! Doc-lap! It was a real hellhole, you can't possibly imagine... rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat! - Doc-lap..what does it mean?- - Doc-lap...it means independence. They went on the attack and shouted : Doc-lap!... Independence! Independence! Difficult, I know. Look... Hold on...on this page here... we'll sample a speech by General De Gaulle. Citizens of France! The events of recent days... Viguier, 4. Sit up straight, my boy. Lecoeur, 6. There was a hint of greatness. Keep it up. Hermes, 0 It's not Abu-Nidal that you need, but rather a dunce cap. Daubert... He doesn't look very interested as we can see. Sad, because this time, you earned good marks. 8 out of 10, the highest mark we've had all week. Well done, my boy. Want do you want? You scared me. What are you doing home so early? I learned from the teacher that he received good marks in class. So I left work early, thinking I could take him for a ride. He's certainly earned it. I'm busy with his Marie-Rose treatment. Wait for him downstairs. Marie-Rose? What's that? It's for lice! Lice? He has lice? Hell, I hope I didn't catch any. You sure do have quite a dose! I'm really proud of you, my Michou. There's nothing like being in the great outdoors. Take a deep breath. Clean air will do you good. You see over there? This is where we'll come fishing when season opens. This spot is just teaming with all sorts of table delights: roach, perch... ...should be a great catch. I'd be really happy if I could catch a big one! Well, don't dream about catching a shark, this is not the sea. But, if you're good and do well in school, I promise one day we'll go. Would you like that? Yes! I have never seen the sea. We'll go to the sea. One nice day. We'll take the V6, by then it should be in mint condition... We'll drive 6 or 7 hours, with the best seat to view the landscapes. We'll stop for gas once or twice, and then, hop... You open your eyes and behold : The Sea!... the waves, the gulls... Careful! It's not my car. You load four beasts in here, the rest in the boss' car. But they're not beasts, Mr. Postman, they're animals. Really... what is your name, my boy? - Pierrot. - Pierrot... Well, you're name is quite fitting for someone who's strolling on the moon. I'll let you in on a little secret, my Pierrot... We're experimenting. The Postal Service may start delivering livestock. But first, we want to make sure it will be a profitable venture. It's a secret... Robert! What are you doing? Bring it back, Michou! And hurry, we can't waste time. Over here! Hurry up! Holy shit! This mutton reaks! Unbelievable. Oh la la la la... What a stink! Happy Eid, my boy. Whoa, whoa, whoa!... Get your hands off my Michou. He's my son. And stop talking to him in Arabic. He can't understand. Got that? Come on, Michou, let's go. You know what they do to the sheep? They slit their throat... either in a sink or a tub. You have all sorts of... We have a problem client over there, he wants to negotiate. Remember that... Say, would you like a piece of cake? My wife has baked one. - Who's this? - He's one of ours. My son, our home is also your home. He's one of ours! My mom is in the hospital. My dad sent me and my brother to a shelter. We were taken in by strangers. My dad is French, a military officer. He can't find out we are Kabyla. It must remain a secret. Shhhh. Don't worry. Do not be afraid. Good Lord, this isn't happening! They took Michou! Michou! Michou! Bunch of barbarians! Michou! Open this door or I'll break it down! Michou! Georges, don't be an idiot. We're not in Saigon. Sheep are my bread and butter. I want to go home to my parents. I don't see a problem, here, alright? If he's in there, it's because he wants to be. Nobody forced him. Robert, tell your friend that we are not barbarians; we're Berbers. All I want is my boy. Where is my boy? Michou... Please don't worry, sir. The kid went to the bathroom. Come in... Come in, you are welcome here. Come in for some tea and some fine pastries...please Please don't be upset. Tomorrow is a holiday. We celebrate Eid. There's enough couscous to last us for three weeks... Here, you can have this back. Say, I was thinking... Have you ever mentioned a grandfather, perhaps Moroccan or something? No...no... Really... not even one or two generations back? Because seeing you over there amongst all those Arabs... It sure looked like you belonged to the tribe. We could have taken you for an aboriginal. No, Georges. I swear! Ha, well... doesn't matter. I actually feel good about it all... And I'll tell you something else... I've seen boys come and go from the orphanage... But you, you have that little something, you're different. At first, I wasn't exactly thrilled... but now, even if you were to confess you're an Arab, it wouldn't bother me. What's the difference? Just a little bit of this, a little bit of that... - We are all the same! - Yes, all the same! Or we're all different if you prefer. Boils down to the same thing. One day, we all end up six feet under. Where will I end up? Gee, I don't know... There you go... See, that doesn't stop you from loving Big Georges, now does it? Always remember this, Michou... Whether we come from here or from anywhere else... we're all equal under the eyes of the man above. The couscous smells nice. Wouldn't mind a sausage right now... At one time I was in love with a hairdresser.... long time ago... He was handsome, brave... He went around posing as an Italian. His name was Maurizio. He promised he would open up a hair studio for me. And then I met Georges. And why did you marry Georges? Our parents knew each other, the military uniform's prestige. Security. Back home, we couldn't marry hairdressers. People would talk. - I see... that was unfortunate. - Yep... Mind you, I wasn't at all unhappy with my Georges. He was away from home quite often, I learned to live without him. We couldn't have children. I didn't know before. It was my biggest disappointment. I don't know why I'm boring you with all of this... Not at all, quite the contrary. Please don't stare at me like that. I'm a country girl. My life's already laid out. Giselle... You know, Giselle... My life is also complicated. Stationed here, stationed there. Never getting attached to anything. And then one day, you meet a woman like you. Natural and stirring. Genuine at every level. Do not mock me. Oh no...not at all. On the contrary... I must go home. There's some venison on the stove. Venison? At this time of year? Whoa... Stop it. Enough, enough... Michou, come forward, please... Best would be for you to open your mouth and pretend you are singing. But just pretend... Yes, Father. I open my mouth, but I don't sing. Exactly. And in the words of St. Augustine... ''Love and do what you like." What does it mean? It's not really important. But what you do need to know... is that St. Augustine was a Berber. A Kabylian, if you like... and that he converted to the Christian faith... understand? Let's take it from the top. Here we go... Messaoud! You're not ashamed? You do like the Christians do? Allah sees you. When the time comes, you'll answer for it. But I'm here only to sing in the choir. I'm biding my time. For Allah, I too would stay put. But I'm dying, here. We have to go! There are people back home in Chateauroux. Go there, they live by the city gates. Agreed. But we must go together. And we're going to need some money. You're staying with the rich folk. So listen to me. You gotta find some dough. If you do it, I won't tell dad about your about hair, your name change or the church. Okay, I 'll do it. But what happens if Georges catches me stealing dough? Don't worry, he won't slit your throat. Come, my son. We have to steady Totoche. He'll move around a bit, but that's okay. We just need to draw his blood, you know, to make blood pudding. Knife, please Okay, hold this.... I bury an Arab in the gut of this pig.... Go for it, Duval. Do it right! What in the world...? Come my baby... It's Duval, Gisou. He said he would bury the the Arabs in the pig's gut. There was blood everywhere. It was awful. After that, I threw up. But it's normal around here. We bleed animals every day by the thousands. Rabbits, sheep, chickens, veal. Are you planning on being a vegetarian? No, but...I could never eat pigmeat, Giselle, I swear to you. There now, don't worry. Come on, let's go talk to them. Why are you terrorizing this child? Next time, you do it elsewhere, Duval. We're not running a butcher shop! Don't be such a mother hen. Peasants! Stop it! An insurrectionary power has established itself in Algeria by a military pronunciamento. This power is a facade : a handful of retired generals. It has a reality... a group of officiers, partisan, ambitious and fanatical This junta can only lead us on the brink of a national disaster. Our State is now violated, the nation ignored, our power compromised. - Turning against his own family, the army. - He should be ashamed. De Gaulle is a traitor. I remind you you've just turned off our Head of State. So what! You heard him. He's accusing the army, leaving the soldiers out in the cold... soldiers like me who gave everything to ensure Algeria would stay French! So I say: Hail Salan! Hail Jouhaud! Hail Challe! Hail Zeller! Long live Salan! Long live French Algeria! Long live French Algeria! Don't forget he's talking about the honor of his country! Some are taking action in Alger. Let's blow up the Eiffel Tower! You will do no such thing! You accuse the forces of order who are protecting you... All you want to do is blow up the Eiffel Tower and play war like children! That's all I have to say. For those who have ears, goodbye! Do you have a fiance? Yes I do. But that's between you and me. She lives in Aubervilliers, near Paris. It's really far away. I'll never see her again. And you? What about me? You have a fiance? Oh, you know...Those things don't really interest me. Besides, I'm from a small town. Have you been to Paris? What is it like? It is superb! There's the Eiffel Tower... and in Aubervilliers, there are castles just like those from the Middle Ages. Only these castles have towers with smoke coming out of them. We call them factories. I was told I would go there some day, when I grow up. But I could never work in there. What will you do when you grow up? Because I want to be a nurse. Later on, I also would also like to heal people. I see... I'd like to be a doctor. Here, I want to show you something... What is it? A totem. A talisman. If you wear it, it will protect you. Like a rabbit's foot? No, way more powerful. It's from the Orient... just like Aladdin's lamp. Well, then... can we ask it anything? Like make a wish? You can always try... Here, place it in your hand. Close your eyes and concentrate on your wish, it will be granted. - Ready? - Yes. Keep your eyes closed and concentrate even harder. There, you can open your eyes. That's amazing, it really works! Yes, yes I know... I hope your boy and that girl aren't doing naughty things up there. You know, at his age, he probably wouldn't do very much. And if they want to play doctor, they'll learn more about anatomy. Hey, Duvalliers... why don't you come help us set the table. Really nice that one, huh? Not much fat, more meat. A little treasure... stashed in a rabbit cage... Sound familiar? No, nope. No... - What about you, Michou? - No. One thing's for sure, all Arabs are thieves. It's in their blood. That's why we chop off their hand! So that they learn their lesson. But why are you telling me this? Well, Michou... STAND AT ATTENTION WHEN I'M SPEAKING TO YOU!! You too! Look, Michou... you're not an Arab and you're not a thief. Am I right? Yes, Georges, I swear... I'm a northerner. A real one. Exactly. Be proud of where you're from. You see, Georges is not exactly a saint. He does things. Things that are a little naughty... But no one ever gets hurt. Bad things, you mean? No, on the contrary. Things that make me feel good. Once in a while, I need to see the street girls , but for that I need money. But what about Giselle? Shut up! Shut up when I'm the one talking. As for Giselle, that door's been shut for quite some time. Stand at attention! Ever heard of the Chinese Bamboo torture? They take chopsticks and drive them really hard under their fingernails, they reach the skin, and after that, they set the sticks on fire! Scream all you want, no one will hear you. Stop it Georges! Stop it! Here, here it is! Look! It was you... Alright... Not a word about this to Giselle. It will stay between us. If you keep quiet about this you'll get your reward. You must learn that when you take from someone, it's for your own good. But when you get caught, the consequences will also be for your own good. That's the reason why you should never steal! We weren't really stealing the money from you. Honest we weren't... I need to tell you something, boss. It's about the kid brother. He lives with the Terrutins. With the Berrutins? He's an Arab. Arab? I knew it. Listen to me carefully... no one must find out. Especially Giselle, okay? Not a word, or you're dead. Got that? Pau-Paul, he... Well, what about Pau-Paul? What does he want? A profilcunatrotic... Phrophylactic? You mean you want to screw around with the women.... again!? No way! I'm not kidding! Go to bed! Prophylactic...geez... get out of here. - Good morning, mademoiselle. - Good morning, sir. I'd like to buy a 4-color ballpoint. Your son stopped using the inkwell? He's not my son. I'm taking care of him because he lost his parents in a car accident. You know, when you're alone, it's not easy raising of a child. That's very courageous of you. Well, I do my best... at times, it can be difficult. Well... here. - What's this? - Oh, just a little something. - It's a small pendant. - I can not take it. Oh, please do. You are so beautiful. I was all over town trying to find the right person to give it to. I was even going to throw it away. But finally, it became clear to me... ...that you were the only one who could wear this gift. more than yesterday, less than tomorrow It's gold, so I'm told. It's magnificent...I'm.... Please forgive me, I lost my mind.... Perhaps I should go. Might be the best... This is for you. It must have cost a fortune a pen like that. It's for the kid. Everybody has one. Besides, he's been pestering me to get him one. Right, Michou? Yes, thank you very much. Could you get the door, Michou... I had a discount. I made a good investment. Why would they give you a discount? And why would you need a pen like that? Well, it can come handy. Look, you have 4 colors in one. Which means, if you lose the pen you lose all 4 at the same time. That's just like you. You can never see the good side of things. Ah, Mr. Mayor... I came to see you because I have a problem and don't know what to do. Perhaps you can help? Oh my God! It's your son. What? You reading my letters again? May I remind you that a postman must uphold the secrecy of all mail. What is it, Georges? Georges... My son... The Army awards posthumously to private Jean-Baptiste Colin... the Cross of Military Valour. He died in battle at Philippeville, with bravery and courage. The nation of France and brothers in arms will never forget him. We offer to his family our deepest sympathies. On my command... Present arms! The best way to pay tribute would be revenge on the Arabs. Hey Georges? Silence... Show some respect for the dead. I need to tell you...I've been transferred to Paris, to my regret. Really? How sad... for once, we had a good teacher. You will be missed. I hope you will miss me. I'm glad you're here. Without you... I wouldn't be able to find a mushroom I need for botony class tomorrow. I'll help you... It would have been great staying with this school, in this region... You haven't even had much time to discover this area. Is it a secret? True, some secrets are hard to unravel. I will miss you. It looks like a mushroom, right there. - Tyrincepe, am I right? Yes...Cepe de Bordeaux Bravo... OAS WILL TRIUMPH! Hurry up, men! Today we will walk in Chateauroux. Things are looking bad. We must hurry if we don't want to get caught. What's the matter? Is there a problem? Where's your bag? - I'm not going. What? Are you chickening out? Give me the money. I don't have it. What?! I had it, but was forced to give it back. He found out... You know, I was lucky that Georges didn't turn me in. Too bad. I'll have to find a way. I'll hitchhike and sleep under the stars if I have to. For the last time, come with me. I swear to you, Abdel, I swear... But I can't. Giselle is good to me. and Georges too...even when he's pissed off. And then there is school. I want to go to school. I want to learn. I can't forget what they did to me, here. I will come back to get you. Always remember... we are your family. Abdel... Give me a hug, at least... Forgive me, Abdel, I'm your little brother. But I'm still little. So long, little brother. Hey! Don't mark this house! It's Duvalier's... God damn it! Who's that kid? Quick, we have to grab him. Otherwise, he might spill the beans! You three split up. We have no time to lose! Hold him! What are you doing here at this hour? Wait, I've got an idea... He's one of them. Look, he's cut! He's the brother of my boarder. I knew it! I'll mark his ass, that'll teach him! Who did this to you? You hear me, Michou! For God's sake, tell me! I told you never to go out at night! Was it Viguier's gang? Hey? Was it his gang? Only they could pull a stunt like this. Fuck! On behalf of the city council and myself, I would like to express our gratitude to a remarkable teacher, Mr. Jacques Lenay... who, unfortunately, will not be with us next year. He's leaving us. We will surely miss you, dear Jacques. You've done so much for our community, for the children... or should I say, forgive me, parents...your children. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And thanks also to all my students who've given me so much joy... ...and at times, so many challenges... I'll always remember my stay in this community. The prize of camaraderie! Well done, Michou. First prize in French composition. That's worth more than all of my medals. You can be proud of that. If you are the first of your class, don't forget, it's because Georges drilled it into you. Giselle. Will you take him home? I'm going with my drinking buddies. I'll catch you later... How's it going, guys? My boy came in first of his class. Let's drink to that! What a shame! Drinks are on me! My boy lost out to a French illiterate. Want to know why...? The teacher was banging Giselle. If you plan on making trouble spreading your nonsense, go find another bar. I saw them. They were making out near the Oak Tree of the Resistance. Formerly the Great Oak of Field Marshall Petain. It must rattle your cage to learn you're a cuckold, no? You already have the car. And it's just the right color. Yellow...it's the color of cuckoldery. Isn't that right, Albert?. Besides, you're used to it. We mustn't forget Maurizio... That's enough! If you two want to fight, take it outside!. Let go! I closed down the boxing ring 10 years ago. Get that?! Marie! Get my gun! You heard my dad. Now everybody out. Move! Put'em up, Viguier, I'll bleed you like a pig! Oh yeah? Like a pig? Well at least my son eats pork. Who's laughing now, hey? You're a retired officer... and you don't even know that Michou spends time over at the Berrutins. Everybody knows about it but you. You blind? Enough, Georges. Headbutting now, hey. At least I don't fight dirty. Dirty! You deserve a good head butt after what you did to Michou's butt! Come on, Viguier! Go ahead. Make sure you don't miss! Stop it or I'll shoot! Anyone else? Scumbags! I need help from nobody. You hear me? Nobody! Not even Him, up there!! This isn't happening. God, this can't be happening... I can't believe He's done this to me, Giselle... What the hell? What's the matter with you? You drunk or something? You slut. You made a fool out of me. Whore... You lied to me all my life. You lied to me before our mariage... when you were bent on Maurizio, that guy who promised you a hair salon. I should have let you go with that phony greaser of yours. Go back to him. Go! You bet I'm gonna go. To my mother's. And I don't ever want to see you again. And don't come back crying to me like you always do. Think again. It's not gonna happen. Not when you're about to run off again with that teacher. - What? - Did you get off on him fucking you? Like he fucks all the whores in the neighbourhood? Because he's got quite the reputation your little teacher. Yes, it's true. He's a better lover than you are. Because between your garden, your fevers and your rabbits, you're pathetic! You could never give me a child. Your seed is fruitless! No, George! You'll never lay a hand on me again, you hear? Never. So be it. Now get out. You bet I'm leaving. It's all my fault. She did nothing wrong with the teacher.. I swear on the life of my mother, whose sick in a psychatric... Psy-cha-tric... I beg you, stop fighting. I'm going to throw myself in the river and you'll never see me again! - Are you leaving? Yes, and you're coming with me. - We're leaving him behind? - Yes. Gather your things, and wait for me downstairs. Dear God... Please make it right between Giselle and Georges. You can't let her go. You too... I saw you at the bookstore in St-Amant. You really liked that girl with the 4-color pens. And then there are the proze... the pross... oh, the whores! Leave me alone, both of you. I don't want to see you again. Let's go, Michou... Hey, Arab boy... Don't forget your wheels. Come on, hurry up! What's this? My daughter...I wasn't expecting you. Charlotte... add two more plates! This boy...who is he? He's from social assistance. He has no parents...well, me. He's like my son. So greet him with open arms. That's all I needed. Arabs. Those camel jockeys are always thirsty. And yet, they were on our side at the Battle of Monte Cassino.... against the Germans. They were with us in the trenches in 1914.... Their blood mixed in with our blood and nourished this land. Come on, let's drink some wine. A reminder of the blood that was spilled... by the poor bastards who died so that the elite could live the high life. So raise your glass to the health of that great whore...France! Please, don't say that. Georges says he wants. You probably don't even give a shit. You think your pants don't stink? Will Gisele come back some day? No... No...I have no idea. All I can say is... Georges is nothing without Giselle. Nothing.... Good morning, losers. Are you happy, now? Anyway, you're all foreigners. You, you're Serbian. And you, you're Latvian. You make me laugh. The whole lot of you. Now I can speak my mind, without shame.... I'm an Arab. And I'm Jewish too, you bunch of riffraffs. Put that in you're pipe. All you're good for is taking it out on children. Must take a lot of courage. Isn't that right, Duval? How many children have you killed in Algeria? How many kids have you snatched from a mother's embrace? only to rape them afterwards, you scumbag? Fuck you! That's it. You'd like to send me to a logging camp, wouldn't you? And maybe start by shoving 15 liters of water down my gut. How many did you grill on the Ashraf....hmmm? You're pathetic. Bunch of cowards! Don't count on me anymore. As of today, we're no longer friends. What are you doing, here? I came to see the kid. I came to see you, especially. I know I haven't told you too many times, but... I love you. I swear to the man above who's looking at us right now. I do love you. Mr. President, my brothers, I am proud to say, on behalf of the provisional government of Algeria, in the birthing hours of our new national independence... I prepared a good pie. I hope you'll like it. Go on, dig in... I wish it was always like this, just the three of us. You know what? I was thinking... we haven't heard from your parents in more than 2 years, and your dad has stopped paying his dues to the hospital... what would would you say if we adopted you? It would be the happiest day of my life. I've already made the official request. I wanted it to be a surprise. They will start looking for them, and if your family can't be found... well... you'll be our son. You'll even bear our name! A fish! We caught a fish! Get the net, it's a biggy! The net, Michou, the net! Hurry, he's getting away! Don't worry, I've got him. He's a gift from the heavens. Michou, you're all wet. Well at least I didn't lose him. Keep holding the net! What are you up to, now? I am Julius Caesar, the Emperor of Gaul... and you are my Cleopatra! Reveal yourself under the Egyptian sun! Oh, you're such a bad boy! Who can that be? Darn, can't they leave us alone! Under the Egyptian sun! Cleopatra...spread your legs! Hold on, I'm coming... Yes...what can I do for you? I'm sorry to bother you, sir. Are you Georges Duvallier? Yes, yes...and you, who are you? I am the father of the young Messaoud who was placed in your care. I came to see him. I have important things to tell him. I see... Well, don't just stand there, come in... No.. actually, please wait a minute. I need to put some clothes on. Well, come in anyway. You can wait in the living room. Do come in. Giselle, get dressed! Quick! Thank you ma'am. Thank you, sir... you are very kind. My poor wife had cancer. They did everything they could to save her. But... You know, when the head stops working, everything else follows. She gave birth before dying and I was left alone with the baby. So I had to go back home. Thanks to God, I found a new wife. And now, we have a country. I see you have pictures of General De Gaulle... He's a darn good man. That, yes. He's a great man. Men like him come only once every century. Lucky for us, it was in this century. Otherwise, we'd have to wait longer for Algeria's independence. I have a gift for you. I would be honored. Thank you, very much. Oh, dates! I love dates. Have had them in a long time. When I was stationed in Casablanca, I would sometimes go to the market... and buy some dates so that I could ship them to my wife. Remember, Gisele? That takes us back a few years...1951. Your boy... I guess you came to take him back... Yes. I must hand you a document from social services. Mrs. Duvallier, this document hereby releases you from custody of the boy Messaoud El Maten, who was entrusted to you since the 4th of October, 1960. His father, Akli El Matten, will resume parental custody of the child and will visit your residence in order to retrieve him. This document will take effect, the moment the child leaves your residence with his father. Don't cry, my love. Please don't cry. Forgive us. At times, life in unfair, you know. Losing this child will disrupt our lives in so many ways. Don't cry, honey, don't cry. That's life... Nothing we can do... Sir, if my wife is so sad... since we had not heard from you... we decided to adopt your child. I completely understand, Mr. Duvallier. We won! We played soccer and I scored a goal! Well done, my boy... You have visitors... Messaoud, my son... It's daddy... I don't know this man. What is he doing here? Why is he calling me Messaoud? My name is Michel. They brainwashed him. He's gone mad. Shut up. Messaoud,come here. I am your father. I'm French and I'm Catholic. My name is Michel! I love that name. It's like Mont-St.Michel! This is witchcraft. They put a curse on him. There are sorcerers here, just like back home. Michou, it's your real father. He came back for you. This is my home. My love.... I must tell you something... Your mother is gone... She was very sick... But now, you have a little sister. She died. I knew it. She's dead. Yes. And now, you will have to go with your father. I don't want to go. I don't. I'm afraid you must, my love. Anyway, he's all you've got. Everything will be fine. Let me do this. Michou, can you hear me? You're a big boy, now. You're old enough to understand. When you came to us, you were very young, a very young boy. Michou... See, it's like the harvest of our garden. And all the vegetables. We watered them so that they could grow. And for you to grow... we watered you with love... You hear that? You have so much love. Nobody will ever take that away from you. All of this love, you hear me? This love will follow you all of your life. Don't worry. There it is... Your father, it's really him. Do you remember...? I asked you to call me Georges. And not to call me daddy. He's your daddy. You must go with him. You'll be able to respect him. You'll be able to love him, Michou. You know the story about the beanstalk , that grew right up to the heavens? Well, there is a star up there. Yesterday, it was called Michou... ... but long ago, it was called Messaoud. And today, it is still called Messaoud. But the name doesn't really matter. What matters is that is shines forever... I'll go with him. I'll leave. I'll call him daddy. And I will love him. Dear Georges... I would like to ask you something... Yes, you'll see the ocean. I'll take you to the ocean. I'm sorry... We do have some bad seeds around here. I'm watching out for them. Look, they can't even spell right. VAINCRA should be spelled with a Q. Perhaps we'll meet again, someday? - Insha'Allah, as we say, back home. - Insha'Allah... Here are his clothes, all washed and ironed. Thank you very much.... Goodbye... Goodbye, Michou... Paul! Paul! So long, Paul! Well, that's my story. It's how it really happened. Ah yes...one last thing. How could I forget... It was on a winter day after I had left... in November, I believe... Michou... Well, come on! Look Georges, it's the sea! It's the sea, Georges! Run...run, my Michou! Wow... it's the sea! The sea! Look at those seagulls! There are tons of them behind the boat. There'll be lots of fish! Georges had kept his promise. What a guy... English subtitles by VitaminSea (2014) Georges died in 1998 at Charenton-Du-Cher. Giselle still lives in her native Berry. Akli was buried in 1995 in Algeria. Messaoud lives in Paris.
