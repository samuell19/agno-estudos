Looks like you only have three more minutes. How disappointing that must be? Forget about the others, keep trying the door. Oh snap. There has to be a way out. Guys, it's open. Oh God. I don't mean to baby you but you only have two more minutes to try and escape. It's locked. No shit. My mama says that they're not real but they haunt me. Every since I can remember, I've been followed by ghosts. The only place they don't bug me is under my bed. What do we do? How do we get out? Keep looking for a clue, a key, something to get us out of here. This is so weird. Hey, I found another weird thing. - Only 30 seconds. - You guys, hurry. There's magnets on top of these. Give me the bottles. There's got to be one more. - Come on, come on. - I got it, here. It's a distraction. Congratulations, you guys just became the first test group to make it out alive. That was insane. Oh good. I really thought we were gonna die in there. Yes. That was the best escape room I've ever done. Key. Can't wait to see what mystery you guys pick up next. Get out. Morning. Hey. Yeah. Bye babe. Name was Annie and it had very purply rainbowish scales and I absolutely loved it and I woke up one morning and it was just gone. I have no idea what happened. You know, it was very sad. It's here, the monster's back. Please help, the monster's in my room. It's in my room, the monster's in my room. Please help, help! There's a monster in here, it's over there. No, I'm not okay, I'm not okay. No, I'm not okay. She's okay. Like I said, she still needs to eat her food. She had another psychotic break. She's not listening and she needs four more shots and I suggest we add another one on. I think that that would really help a lot if we do something like that. All right. It wasn't me. Why doesn't anyone believe me? Stop, stop, stop it wasn't me. Why doesn't anyone believe me? Stop, stop! Why doesn't anyone believe me? Stop! He's late. He's always fucking late. Patience. Smooth run tonight. The trap doors, the puzzles, clues are easy enough. It only took 17 years. Patience is a virtue. Hey, hey. Where were you? I got caught up at the pharmacy. Do we have a problem? Uh no, no problem, man, I got the stuff right here. Well, man, did you get everything we need? Yeah, it's all there. I even threw in a couple extra needles, just in case. Look, I wrote down my clear instructions on how to use it. This is some serious shit, though. Are you sure you guys don't need me to help administer the dose? Look at the fine mess you've made, Tabitha. Please, I was just starting to clean up. The boss isn't gonna like this. Next please. Hi, can I get a black coffee, two bear claws and... We're actually out of bear claws right now. Is there anything else you'd like? Oh okay, what do you want sweetheart? Donut holes. You want donut holes? Okay, that's fine. All right, so it'll be $15.75 please. Awesome. Oh crap, oh no, I think I forgot my wallet. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry, hold on one moment. I got this. No, you don't have to, it's okay. I want to. Well... Thank you, that's really kind of you. No, it's no problem. Can you say thank you to this nice gentleman? Thank you. It's my pleasure. How's the clean up coming? Just another drug deal gone bad. Such a shame really, everyone so hoped that legalizing would quell criminality. Your efforts are greatly appreciated. I live a life of service. Are you fucking kidding me? What? It's a rental. Look, my boy Mattie has found the one, I'm celebrating. The one? Please. Do I detect a little jealousy? Yeah, that's it. It's all right, that's your ex, I feel it, I feel it. Feeling like you married the wrong guy? If I had married Mattie, I wouldn't have to keep asking him for money. Alrighty, let's get you all buckled. Ah crap. Hey, hey, hey, I got you, I got you. What are you, like my guardian angel or something? Maybe. Hold on. Oh hi honey. Yeah, I realize that. Well, you know, actually the person behind us offered to pay. It was really nice of him. Well yeah, we're on our way back right now. I love you too. Okay bye. I'm sorry about that but thank you again, I really appreciate it. Here, in case you ever need to call on your guardian angel. I just might do that, thank you. Are you ready to go see daddy? Yeah. Hi, I'm so glad you made it. Hi, nice to finally meet you. Tyler, I've heard a lot of stories. I bet. It's so nice to see you. Can I help you with your bag? No, I'm good. There he is. It's good to see you, man. Good to see you. I like your new toy. She's pretty great. Hey babe, why don't you show 'em the guest room? I'm gonna take a quick swim. Okay, let's go. Matthew wanted to make sure you were comfortable. I'm wet. Do you need anything? We'll just get settled in. Great, you settle in and I'll be around. Need a hand? It's very clever. Halloween 1995. Really, you're gonna go there? What happened Halloween 1995? Come on, Ang, like you need another reason? We were drunk, just skating around looking for a little party. Matt. Ease up, all right? So we come across this old house that's for sale. It's completely empty, teenage boy's dream. Well Tyler decides to pull the old B&E. Tyler decides? Okay, all right, I don't think I like your tone brother. He just starts tearing the place up. I start tearing? Okay, what were you doing, hmm, just knitting in the corner like a good upstanding citizen? Would you expect any less? You guys are so dumb. And you didn't get caught? No, just wait. Hey. So we're wasted. Boys will be boys. And there's a knock at the door. Just stop. Tyler puts his mask back on to do some weird shit. Why are you doing this? And it was the cops. Tyler literally pisses himself. He's sitting there bawling in tears. We did a 12 hour stint in juvey waiting for our parents to show up. Mattie's mom was pissed. No shit. To Mattie, the best worst sidekick ever. Cheers. More wine? Yes, please. In fact, I'll help you. Yes, please. Wrong number? Ain't nothing wrong about that. Still the same old dog, huh? I got a few new tricks. I've known Mattie a very long time. They're very close. They share everything. What about her? I thought you said she was the one? No, she's great. Not smart enough to ask questions, hungry enough to appreciate what I provide for her. They share everything, everything but secrets. And that ass. And that ass. But man, you are always the man. We'll have a night cap in the pool. Babe, wear that suit we got in Italy. Do you hear yourself? You are too much. I'm drunk, sorry. You ever get nervous? How wasted are you? Very. You got all this shit, house, job, this life. Do you ever get nervous that one day it could all just go away? No. Shit man, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night clenching my chest. You ever think do you really deserve this life? Easy. I don't know how you do it. I know I can so I do. I guess. Dude, you live dangerously close to the line. I'm done with this conversation. Does this bother you? It's nothing Mattie hasn't seen before. Angela hates me. Yeah well, Ang is a fucking monster cunt. You bet she is. What was that? A crow, hit the window. Is it dead? No. Is it suffering? It won't die for awhile. I was nine and Mandy was six. Oh I made it. Go Mandy, hurry! We were just little girls. Hey. Hi. What are you guys doing? Playing with my sister. Looks fun. Yeah. Come on, girls, lunch is ready, let's go. Please mama, please let us go trick-or-treating alone. I'm big enough to watch out for sissy. Aw, big brave Emily. You swear you'll look out for her? Swear. Okay then. Yeah! But come back before dark, don't go too far. Really look after your sister and don't take any open candy. We won't, mom. I love you, girls. Love you too, mama. Trick or treat. Trick or treat. Trick or treat. Huh! Mandy, where are you going? I don't think anyone's home. What's wrong? You don't have to be scared. I couldn't move. I was so scared by what I was seeing. And I saw you for what you really are. A monster. Mandy, no! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! What did you do to Mandy? Come on man, we got to, we got to call the cops, man. We got to get some help. What, what do you want to do? She's already dead. Do you want to call the cops? I wonder what they would say if I told them I stumbled upon you with two dead girls? Two? No man, this was an accident. We don't have to do this one. No, no, no Tyler, this isn't an accident. This is kidnapping and it's murder. Ah man, we can't do this. I don't know why he did it, officer, he's deranged. He lured these two small girls into here. I thought we were just gonna go trick or treating. Nah, they wouldn't believe you. What, you think they would believe you over me? Tell me why you want to do this. Because I fucking can. Come here. Come here. Now you have been a bad little girl, Emily. You're jealous of your little sister. You missed being the only child, didn't you? You brought your sister out here to kill her so you could be the only child again. If you ever tell anyone about this, and we'll kill the rest of your family too. My baby sister's body. Are you seeing the monsters right now? They're hiding. I see. No, no, no! Please, you have to help me. It's gonna kill me like it killed my sister. It's gonna be okay, sweetie, it's gonna be okay. Keep your mouth shut as you have been given lines and do not speak to the participants at all. This is a handsome crowd. Everyone was so happy to help. Well that really warms my heart. And how are you this morning? I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I can't wait to open my fucking Christmas present. And I've been such a good little girl, daddy. Just a few hours more. The boss is really pleased with us. You will all surely be rewarded for your efforts. You cannot stray from the plan. You must remain in control. And whatever you do, you have to stay on schedule. You all look fabulous. You get dressed because it's showtime, folks. File out. You. Wow buddy, this looks delicious. Just try it. Oh, saved by the buzz. Joe, I'm gonna take this. Hey. I was raw vegan for awhile but my doctor advised me against it. Oh really? Matthew has me on a jogging regimen, three miles a day. Matthew, are you still doing Pilates? You know, I've been doing Pilates, yoga, cross training, and I've been running like eight miles. It's insane. It's like... Hey, so my buddy Joe has tickets to the new escape room. Escape room, like the Jodie Foster movie? No, that's Panic Room. Look, I got the trailer here. Can you play this on your TV? Stop in for a visit to the Escape Hotel, a real life puzzle. Oh my God, I've never been in an escape room before. I had no clue what was gonna happen. I was freaked out of my mind. Where did I find the clues? I found the clues in the weirdest places, where nobody should go. It was absolutely insane. We were running down this hallway, we had no idea which room it was. Sometimes I questioned if the puzzles were actually part of an escape room or if I was in some Saw-like psycho's labyrinth. I was gonna die. I was like oh my God. Three, two, one, time's up. I don't get it, is it a haunted house? No, like the video just said, an escape room is a real life game where you're locked in a room and you have to use the elements of the room to solve a series of puzzles and escape within a set time limit. Exactly. And my buddy has four tickets. He was gonna go on a double date but the other couple canceled so he doesn't want to go alone. That's odd. Oh my gosh, that sounds so fun, we should do it. Maybe it'll be like Saw and I get to choose whether I survive or kill my husband. Don't laugh, she's serious. What do you think babe? Sure, why not? My man. Welcome to the Escape Hotel. What is your business here? We have reservations for the Crime and Justice room. Ah, so you're surrendering yourselves to the court? Oh come on, we're here for the escape room bullshit. Follow me. This is extremely impressive. Lieutenant, these must be the last of the suspects to surrender. Come on. Summons and identification. Really? Summons and identification or we can do this the hard way. Nope, sorry, I got it. Here you go, Tyler Jones, party of four. Brittany Lamb, Angela Lopez, Tyler Jones, Matthew Blake, you are under arrest in connection to the disappearance of two little girls. Really? It's part of it. We've combed every nook and cranny looking for those little girls. Not one trace of their body. Their bodies? One can only assume that they're already dead. Can we just get back to this or? We're sorry, go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead, please. Okay, okay. Any personal or valued belongings shall be relinquished at this time. Wallets, cell phones, watches and other possessions or I will remove them from your person and hold them against your will. Okay, okay, we'll play by your rules. This is already too stupid. You have the right to remain silent and I suggest you use it. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. And God help the sick son of a bitch who's found guilty. There is a special place in hell for child abusers. Officer, lead them to the line up. Let's move it out, people. Good job, Becky. That one felt good. Getting better every day. Line it up. Bit pushy. You are so sleek. Thank you. Do not speak to other guests. That's right, sorry, yes, sir. Sit tight, the lead detective is en route. No phones. Suck a dick. Watch it. Roger that, captain. Tough guy. Hey, you look very beautiful. You hey, you remind me of my mother. Oh you got jungle fever, huh? Are you kidding me? Quiet. Seriously? Hey, no worries, brother. Hey, not worth it. Seriously? The detective. How you all doing? Great, we're pumped. Right guys? Given the unique circumstances surrounding the disappearance of these young ladies, we're gonna be conducting this investigation in a slightly unorthodox way. Sign and pass it down. Apparently this guy had a job at like a real insane asylum. Now he runs this place, ain't that so cool? My name is Sam. This is my partner Tabitha. We have a piece of evidence that leads us to believe that one of you knows the whereabouts of these young girls. And we have the authority to hold you here until either they're home safely or their bodies are uncovered. Please fill out the personal information accordingly. It's a standard release form, just sign. But first thing's first, welcome. Mmm God. Seriously? Now we know that only one of you is guilty of this crime. But none of you are innocent really. The best justice is revenge. We're gonna be watching you all very closely. If any of you exhibit any kind of guilt, you will be dealt with accordingly. This one's nice. I think I'd like to strip search him. Hey I got an idea, why don't we all head down to the interrogation room? Shall we? Off you go. File out! Just take the compliment. This is awesome. The little girls were last seen trick or treating just before sundown. We think that someone coaxed them off that path and we think that someone's in this room. Huh? You could save us all a lot of time and trouble if you'd just confess. Confess, it was you. You think this is a joke? Believe me, by the end of this night, one of you is gonna be begging to confess. All right, all right, we'll do it the hard way. Good luck, chickies. The only way out is to escape the room. You've got one hour. I got something. It's dated 10/31/95. It says, "Witness reports seeing two young girls "roughly eight years of age "walking west of Shasta Drive at 5:45 p.m." It says, "Saw the girls get into a white truck "and drive off with someone that they "seemed to know"." 8545, 8545, 8545, 8545. You okay, Rainman? The numbers, everything's got to be a clue, right? So I'm just keeping track. Look who showed up today. I like that. Okay, this is the end of it, "The truck was registered to an Aaron Thacker." Says, "He came in for questioning, "we recorded his statement and released him "as his story checked out." Tape recording. All right, let's divide and conquer. I got the safe. Oh, try 8545. Guys, this desk, it's locked. It was totally normal. I know Megan and Ellen. Sometimes my mom makes me watch them when she and Mrs. Mayer drink wine. Ellen was crying because she lost her necklace, this little silver E. She was really upset. I just gave them a ride back to the neighborhood. They got into my car and headed back to their house and haven't seen them since. It was weird, I don't remember seeing them go into their house. My mom came out of the house to tell me to bring the cans in. She distracted me only for a second, not that long. Like not long enough for the girls to have crossed the street even. When I turned back, they were gone. I did find Ellen's necklace though, maybe it fell off her costume in my car, I don't know, but you can have it if you want. Yo, found-o le-necklace-o. Bring it over here. There's a carving under this drawer, it's an E. There's nothing in this book, just normal kids stuff, colored pages, mostly in the lines. What are you, some art critic? Oh, got it. Making moves. Shouldn't we be looking for fluids? Knock that off. Whoopsy daisy. Woo. There we go. There we go. Check it out. Anybody hear me? Hello? - Help me. - Shut up, dad, dad! Francis, come on, just, daddy's having a little fun. This is cute and all but yeah... What would you do without me? Look. Yep, there it is, X1 fire extinguisher. It's too ash tray. This does look oddly out of place. There's grooves in the top. Ty, hand me that chair. Hand me the ash tray. Dum dadumdum. Just open the damn door. Okay, whatever makes you happy chief. Looks like we got a new situation on our hand out here. No fucking way. Let me see that. Thank you, sir. Holy shit. - Dad? - Babe? It's not over yet. - Dad? - What? Whoa? Bitch, this door is locked. Keith, just use the key. I took it. I'm so sorry, I took it as a souvenir. Open it up! Guys, we are wasting time. Maintenance will take care of these guys, we need to just get moving. Help us, help us! Are you guys okay? It doesn't fit. The key won't work on this side. This is fucking impossible. Guys, do you not get it? It's part of it. It's part of it. What? Yes, obviously if there's something really wrong, they'd shut the room down. That's a valid point. You seem to know an awful lot about what's going on. It's because I've seen this before. They use a couple moles to throw you off the trail and waste time and that's what we're doing, we're wasting time. And this place just does not quit, let's go. Nancy Drew's in her element. This is my nightmare, Tyler. It's campy. Hey, what's your play, huh? What are you talking about? Found it. Oh my God. Are y'all seeing this shit? Oh my God, this is amazing. Um, uh, mhmm. Okay man, you're the escape room expert, get me out of here. Right. Well I found something. Okay. "Means, motive and opportunity. "My client, though presented with the opportunity "had neither the means nor the motive "to have perpetrated the murder of this little girl." They found the little girl. Wait, I thought it was two little girls. Good point. Is that a clue? It's got to be a clue, right? Well there's more. "Based on the injuries sustained, "our client was in fact a victim of the same crime. "I present Exhibit A." Aha, Exhibit A. "Defensive wounds, bruises five inch diameter." That's a big bruise. "The prosecution suggests "the bruising on the client's arms "were defensive wounds inflicted by her victim. "My client's baby sister clinging to her "pleading for her life. "What child has palms that big?" Jesus Christ, the little girl did it? No, weren't you listening? They were saying the defendant was wrongfully accused. Oh. But what's the clue? What do we do with this information? Guilty! I fucking hate this place. Ang, you all right? Something just touched me. Exhibit B. Oh hey, I think Exhibit B is the VHS player. There's a tape player here. Is there a tape? Fuck, Chris. This is part of it. It's gotta be part of it. This guy's got no pulse. What? Ang, Angela? Brittany, Brittany! I feel like I'm losing my mind, Tyler. Brittany! This shit is crazy. There are no monsters here. Monsters are not real, remember? Your screaming won't help you find Angela and Brittany. The doors have been opened. That's enough of a clue. Don't be so stupid. You know what to do. Where you going? I'm getting out of here. I see what's going on. What are you talking about? It's a little too familiar, Tyler. Matt, you're scaring me. Oh I'm scaring you? What are you doing? Surviving. We love your fighting spirit, Matthew Blake, but I'm sure soon, you'll find that you're powerless in this game. Relax, your lives are in very capable hands. Angela? Sorry about that. But don't worry, your time's almost up, Matthew. I think you know how this story ends, do you not? Perhaps the way out is also the way in. Are you ready to pay for your sins? This is real? Surprise. You did this? Don't be stupid, I just accused you of doing this. Where's Ang... You got me. You got me. I give up. Matthew Blake gives up. Fuck! Who are you, huh? Who are you? How do I know you, huh? Are you a sad dad? Hi Alice. Did you miss me, sweetie? Ooh, stinks in here. Did you do a wee wee? Help, help, help, help! Help, somebody! Hey, you want me to put this back on? 'Cause I really didn't want to do that today. I was hoping to get some nice kisses, no? Please, my family has money. They'll pay you. They can pay you. No one will ever know. Hey, well I don't want money or need it. But I tell you what if you give me one last little soft kiss, then I'll kill you quickly. What? Why are you doing this? Fuck you. Suit yourself. Do you miss your precious little whore daughter? 'Cause that's what she was. I can assure you that. Or maybe you're a jealous husband. Please no. Please stop it. Please, please no. No, what do you want from me? I'll do anything, please. Ah, ah, ah, , she just wants to go home. Please, what do you want? Please? Well maybe you shouldn't cheat on your husband with random guys. I won't and I'm sorry. I won't again, I swear I won't. You won't? You won't? No, I won't. You promise? And let me guess, you won't say anything about me, right? No, I swear, I swear to God I won't. I swear, please, please, I swear. Hey, hey, you know I'm just kidding right? No, no, no, no, no, no, I won't say, I won't say anything. Please, I won't, I won't, I swear. Please, I swear. I won't tell anybody, I swear, please. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Okay please. Please I swear. I'm just kidding. This was gonna happen either way. No, no, no, no, no, please! In which case you should be thanking me for saving you from a lifetime of bitching and nagging and pissing and moaning. Fucking answer me! You thought you could fuck with me. You thought you could fuck with me. Oh my God. I took care of it. Still don't believe me? Brittany, I never should've doubted you. Fuck. You've done it again. Too bad the only survivor is also your only friend in sickness and health, till death do you part. What oath has lasted longer, the tongue or the heart? There can be no secrets if somebody knows. It's your choice now who lives and who goes. Till death due us part. Angela, she may still be alive. No. What? She's dead. You heard the man, it's my choice now who lives and who dies. Matt, think about what you're saying. Oh I'm thinking. I'm thinking that there's no need for you to keep my secrets if you're dead. We're brothers, you and me. We can fight our way out of here. It's a team, we make a good team. Please, we're brothers. I paid for your silence for years. What, that wasn't enough? I never said a word. And I never will. Then how'd it get to this point? I know I never talked. So go ahead, Ty, lie to my face. Tell me one more time that you never told a soul. Never. Right. So you got greedy, huh? What'd you do look up some grieving father, some pissed off husband? They give you more money to bring me down or did you finally grow a pair of balls? I'm not like that. I'm not a monster. Oh come on, Tyler. I just have to know. You seemed content for the last 17 years me taking care of you. What changed that? I never said a word. I'm your brother, thicker than blood. Oh Tyler, it suited you. You made that choice. You're right, I did make that choice to not say shit. Maybe if I had, we wouldn't be here. Maybe it's not your choice. There can be no secrets if someone knows. Matthew. How? Tyler. They came in and injected him. I was just waiting for them to come back for him and get me. How terrible. Yeah, we're gonna get out of here. Aren't you tired, Mattie? What are you talking about? Brittany, you're scaring me. Matthew, I'm scaring you? What are you talking about? I can't believe you don't remember me. I could never forget you. What's happening? Aren't you tired, Matthew? Stop! What are you talking about? Well I'm tired. I'm tired of pretending. Stop! Stop talking in riddles! I'm worried about you, babe. Honestly, I can't believe you don't recognize me. At the beginning, I thought for sure you'd be able to place my face. That was naive. I watched you from afar for a long time. I studied you, analyzed you. At first, I thought maybe you'd changed, maybe you were just a troubled child, maybe you had problems at home. I didn't know then. I was just a kid then I told everyone what I saw and I waited for you to come kill my family. But you didn't need to make good on that threat. Mommy. No. No. We have to take her away ma'am, I'm sorry. What? What? She did do this. Mommy, daddy, the monster did it, the monster did it. Mommy, daddy, the monster did it. Please, the monster did it. Please, the monster did it. Why aren't you listening to me? No one ever believed me. Bet you feel crazy huh, 'cause no one believes you? And I still lost them. Why won't they believe me? Do you remember me now? Emily. I have to admit I was a bit peeved at first at how oblivious you were. As I stayed near, I kept replaying our last encounter over and over in my head. Ah, it's here. Please help, the monster's back. Please help, it's here, the monster is back. I'm not just some guy who stops by once. I was elated to hear your conviction. I had to come pay my respects. You understand? Entirely. So how did you pull all this off? Well... No one believed me when I told them a monster had murdered my sister. They thought I heard voices, that the voices made me do it. You know, silver lining, I made a lot of friends in there. It's funny how excited a bunch of lunatics get when you pitch them a revenge plot. My God. Mom, why won't anyone believe me? Stop it wasn't me, stop! Stop! Stop, it wasn't me, stop! Why won't anyone believe me? Stop! Please, stop, let me go! Stop, let me go, please. Please, let me go! Please stop! Please, help me, let me out! There are no monsters here. Monsters are not real. And if they were, we can beat them. Emily, Emily, Emily no. Emily no, I'll see you soon, I love you. Tell me when you're ready. Emily, I'll see you soon, I love you. Hey crazy, here's all the info on your blind date, DMV records, pictures, fingerprints, everything you asked for. Merry fucking Christmas. When I got out, the first thing I did was look you up. I had you followed. You looked different after all the surgeries you had. You were just as cute as you were that day. The day on the skateboard, you remember. Oh I saw the fun you had over the years, all those missing girls. Yep, all there. If you want my opinion, one psycho to another, you're letting your pride make you sloppy. I was only watching you for a week before I noticed your tendencies had progressed. So why not just call the cops? Matthew, you and I both know police are ineffective at best. So what's your end game, Emily? Emily's dead. You're not even mad, are you? Mad? I'm inspired. When I first met you, I thought you'd be the perfect victim, no family, no records, hell I thought you were a runaway with no one to come looking for you. Then why not kill me? Simply, it's nice to have a built-in alibi. I couldn't have dreamed up a more perfect woman than you. I created you. I love you. Thanks but I already met someone. Hey buddy. You? I want you to meet my new girlfriend, Brittany. She got in touch with me about four years ago. After I realized how close you two had remained I found it fitting to get in touch. Now that's the cute version of the story. We had a little chat and we quickly bonded over you. Thanks for that, buddy. Brittany really is a great girl. This punk bitch? What's the matter, bro? I thought you liked sharing my women. On the ground! On the ground! I will drop you! He killed our friend. I'm sorry. He's crazy, he killed our friend. They were our first non-test group into the rooms. Everything seemed to be going very well. In character, I greeted our guests, presented them with the first clue, then locked them in the first room. Matthew seemed very cool, almost too cool. After about 20 minutes into the tour, he snapped. Yeah, it was super weird, like at first he seemed cool, and then he went totally agro. Yeah, he was screaming and yelling at his girlfriend, hands all over his buddy's woman, so then I stepped in and I told him, you know knock it off. He lost it, pulled a knife out, grabbed me by the hair and then he started saying he wasn't gonna let anyone out unless his girlfriend and his best friend admit they were screwing. Then I tackled him from behind and I told him no one touches my daughter unless it's me, you know? What? I kicked the knife away and then I snuck out the fire emergency exit. I fought Matthew off, I followed my daughter and then after that it was all a blur. I just don't remember. Just adrenaline flowing, you know, being a single dad and all, I'm just not meant to be the hero. So you seeing anybody? Did he say anything else to you? He just kept giving a play by play of all the women I guess he's killed over the years, dating back to the '90s. Yeah, like Ted Bundy. He was very handsome, hot, hot with the ladies. Daddy. Yeah, what, what'd I say? Ted Bundy was real life. Okay. I've never been so scared in my entire life. I love escape rooms, I mean this is the best but... Did Matthew try to harm you or did he provide any motive for his break with reality? I mean that dude obviously has a problem with women. He was calling all of them whores and saying that women have wronged him his whole life. Then he grabbed that poor girl by the throat and stuck a knife. I mean I froze 'cause in escape rooms, you don't know what's reality or what's part of it, if it's part of the thing. When did you know it was real? When Keith and Joe left, he strangled her. I mean he hit his girlfriend over the head with a pipe and he strangled her in front of her husband saying something about an affair. So I went and hid in the room and I guess he forgot about me or something. That's when responders came in. I'm lucky that I'm not dead. I'm lucky that I was not hurt. Fuck off! Hey, fucking bitch! I'll fucking kill you! I loved him. I'll fucking kill you! Fuck off me, you know who the fuck I am? God damn it. Fuck! I bet you feel crazy huh, 'cause no one believes you? Never forget Emily that you can do anything you want. I'll fucking kill you. If you put your mind to it. If you believe in monsters, you have to believe that you can beat them. Some people say that an eye for an eye leaves the world blind. I say it's a hell of a lot better to get even. Leaving people in the dust, the monsters that try to take you down, is no way to live. Getting even is the best revenge.
