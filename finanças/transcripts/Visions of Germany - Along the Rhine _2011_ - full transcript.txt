Sea more than 800 miles away most of the river sources are in the high alts many of them in Switzerland where in the spring melting snow and ice rushed down the mountainside and fill the Upper Rhine tributaries to overflowing but by summer the river usually becomes one of the most Placid and navigable waterways in the world on this particularly rural section of the Upper Rhine there is not usually a great deal of commercial activity here in the region of baden-württemberg where the Rhine makes a sweeping turn northward through one of the most beautiful and beguiling parts of Germany it might be interesting to leave the river briefly and visit the Schwarz vault or Black Forest the vast and densely wooded forest covers most of the region and if the name conjures up images of Hansel and Gretel and a frightful which it should the Brothers Grimm had it in mind when they compose their fairy tales passage through the mountainous forest is certainly neither fast nor easy it isn't

the horn salon family dynasty which ultimately ruled Prussia and later the German Empire had its beginnings here a good deal of the castle was remodeled in the 19th century but much of the 15th century Saint Michael's Chapel still survives from the original they say that rather than having a university Tuebingen 'is a university so important have students been to the life of this attractive

lodge for the entire state the renounce city of Heidelberg a man neckar river has attracted university students since the 14th century but it is the heidelberg castle and it's remarkable view of the entire valley that draws the tourists these days University buildings around this church built for the Jesuits in the 18th century a very highly respected University Heidelberg is still remembered a bit too much for its portrayal in the operetta the student Prince for its rowdy drinking bouts and dueling scars the NECA River eventually joins the Rhine well below where we had departed it to visit the Black Forest and it is the quiet flowing Rhine River we will rediscover and follow once again on its lyrical passage northward to the sea on peaceful days the Upper Rhine is as much a watery Playland as it is a commercial passageway but commerce there is on this placid section of the river is usually relatively modest watersports have a very different look at this popular rhyme Playland only a few kilometers from the river itself north of Catherine the Rhine becomes a much busier waterway tug boats and barges sometimes convoys of them container ships and tourist boats freighters fishing boats and ferries plied a narrow river continuously making the Rhine one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world this is one of the youngest towns in Germany built in the 18th century when prince Colville hem decided to retire here hence the name cows whore or calls rest this palace was calls not so modest retreat from the cares of life in nearby Milan is one of the best-preserved medieval monasteries in Europe but restoration unfortunately means that we're also bound to see lots of scaffolding the 12th century abbey and its surrounding buildings have been a highly recommended site on UNESCO's World Heritage List since 1993 if there is room for just one more eighteenth-century palace in our itinerary it should be this one not only for its neoclassical design but for its unusual name Chevette singin Manheim and its sister city Ludwigshafen are primarily bustling hard-working industrial cities and ports today in Mannheim is an exception because the populace has come to the fairgrounds for a well-earned day of food and fun [Music] the Friedreich's plots garden and it's ancient Vasa tome or water tower are located in one of Manheim's finest and usually busiest of neighborhoods but almost no one is here today naturally not everyone's back at the fair this bridge takes us to one of the oldest towns in Germany bombs a surprising name to English speakers and it becomes even more humorous if you recall from history class the strangely named diet of worms which forced Martin Luther to stand trial for his so-called heresies here in whomps he refused to recant his beliefs and was banished to the outer reaches of the Empire Vons Cathedral completed in the 12th century remains one of the finest Romanesque creations in all of Germany ironically just on the other side of the central marketplace a smaller and much newer church commemorates the changes brought about by the religious Reformation begun by Martin Luther vineyards abound along the shores of the Rhine but these just north of bombs are distinctive they produce leap flower me a very popular sweet white wine intended mostly for export one of the main stops in the Deutsche Bahn Strasse the German wine route is bad dürkheim also known for its annual host market don't let the name of the event fool you it really celebrates the wine harvest divorced is secondary and the sheer size of this wine barrel proves it castle ruin starts the forested landscape of the palace a vault almost all the way back to the shores of the Rhine River Mainz is situated where the mine River joins the Rhine and that fact alone would make it a prominent City it is Germany's most important wine market and it's magnificent Cathedral has also been beautifully restored but all of these things pale before the fact that a man who changed the world was born here Johannes Gutenberg who invented modern printing touré Ruttenberg bibles are on display at the gutenberg museum surprisingly a bit further east along the quiet river mine is one of Germany's and the world's greatest cities prosperous cosmopolitan Frankfurt headquarters of many international corporations site of the world's largest book fair and the ancestral home of Germany's greatest writer johann wolfgang von goethe the city centre is really the restored old town known as the looma back a charming square round the other hothouse for old town hall graced by 15th century timbered houses and the churches of saint nicholas and st. paul the old warmer back is a startling contrast to the new Frankfurt only a few blocks away has a great modern banking and financial center Frankfurt has the contemporary skyscraper look to go along with it which is why the city on the mine is nicknamed mine Houghton the old opera house was completely burned down during World War two it was rebuilt in its original neoclassical style but these days it is used primarily as a conference centre Finance has been the lifeblood of Frankfurt ever since the city was granted the right to print money in the 16th century the first stock exchange was established on this spot in 1558 so international is the attraction and flavor of this great city that one Frankfurt resident in every four is foreign-born returning to the Rhine gives us a chance to linger a while in Wiesbaden a thriving and still very chic spa resort Wiesbaden has been a bathing spa as far back as Roman times but it was during the town's heyday in the 19th century that it became a rendezvous for royalty in the wealthy from around the world the graceful homes still reflect the style of the town's golden days the same castles along the Rhine are really actually in the river but this small fortress not only repelled potential enemies it was also used as a toll booth in the old days ship captains had to pay up if they intended to go any further on the Rhine our journey on the river however is far from over though the locals call this monument the goddess of wine it is actually gem Manya commemorating the reestablishment of the empire in 1871 and certainly we can all drink a toast to that in one sense the Rhine Valley describes the entire River setting but in fact it is really only the short stretch of the river known as the Rhine tyle famous with the Rhine wine the breathtaking succession of romantic castles and it's world-famous legends and mystical tales the most romantic and legendary stretch of the river starts at the town of Bingham easily recognized by the towering book club an ancient castle stronghold one after another the castles of the Rhine tiles slide by each always a reminder of the mysterious history of this place the tales of chivalry and sorcerers the magical story of the Nibelungen upon which Richard Wagner based his Ring cycle forerunner to the contemporary Lord of the Rings these are just some of the thoughts and feelings this particular stretch of river can evoke the legend of the Lorelei the rock of lore is of a beautiful enchantress who lures sailors to their deaths here with her sirens songs a more practical understanding is that the currents that this narrow Bend can be very treacherous and many boulders tumbled down from the high cliff and lie dangerously just beneath the water's surface tour boats often stop here to allow for lunch and a river sidewalk the town's most famous tourist site is the remains of a Roman military camp no town on the winding river is more strategically placed than this one a castle that cannot quite be seen from the rivers book s a fairytale fortress situated in the untamed as Valley it is not at all rare for the castle to be suddenly enveloped in mist the vineyards are terraced even more steeply further downriver and as we approach Koblenz weather Mosel joins the Rhine the wine takes its name from the river it's a Mosin the entrance of this major tributary which joins the Rhine from France is marked by Deutsche SEC the German corner here stands an enormous equestrian statue of Emperor Bill hem the first the river promenade on the Mosel is the perfect place to sample the local bratwurst and although this is wine country why not a bottle of dark and tasty Schwarz beer the activity is far more sedate at the electoral palace the core firstly his schloss the fun years mostly in just trying to pronounce the name this fortress on the heights above the confluence of the Rhine and the Mosul commanded and protected the city for almost a thousand years a very short ride from Koblenz is the small volcanic crater lake of maria la which is significant for the superb Benedictine abbey built along its Shore its construction is considered a masterpiece of German Romanesque architecture several times each day to a quarry enchants echoes through the church galleries only the towers of the Ville maggin bridge remain it was over that bridge in March 1945 that American troops crossed the Rhine deeper into Germany only days later under the weight of armored vehicles the bridge collapsed this bridge in bun is named after President John F Kennedy widely admired in Germany for his strong support of the German Federal Republic during the Cold War bun became its provisional capital in 1949 the city is also well known as the birthplace of ludwig van beethoven who grew up in this prosperous residential neighborhood his former home is now a museum displaying precious musical manuscripts and much early memorabilia this geometrically perfect palace and Botanical Garden is in the bun suburb of Papa stove they belong to the University but visitors are more than welcome this late 17th century Palace now has a spun University which may make it one of the most beautiful educational settings anywhere in the world since it is getting a bit crowded up here and since the storm clouds further north over the river look rather threatening this might be a good time to turn back up the river and seek clearer skies a good time to avoid the dangerous Lorelei's sirens some and though wicked spirits conjured up by the Brothers Grimm in the Schwarzwald to allow the Setting Sun to begin to settle slowly behind us above the ever meandering Rhine River over the river of memory and the river of time which urban flow but never end.
