Most of the battalions of 27th Mohammad Rasulullah (PBUH) Division have recently returned from several weeks of defence in the south war zones and are heading for Tehran on furlough. Nobody knows yet that July 12, 1988 is going to be a fateful day in the history of the war between the two countries; one of the most important days of this war... Turnery... Carpentry... It's plumbery; it's plumbery this time. Bravo, yeah. I saw some pipes and stuff in the car. Yes bro, plumbery. Well done, bro. Building maintenance or something, right? Something of that sort. It's something like that. New occupation again... right? You know what he's saying to Aziz now... right? "I'm positive this career will take off....." and "This is the last time I change jobs..." and "I won't change jobs anymore..." and "You should quit teaching and work with me" and..... But I'd say it's not Khalil; Aziz is speaking. No way... it's not Aziz. If it's Aziz, it's all just a walk down the memory lane. His child might've babbled a new word again or asked too big a question for his age and he's been filled with joy. He's on cloud nine! If it's the case, he'll run off at the mouth at the train all the way to Tehran. Yeah, that's it. They're not telling memories. Check out their standing style. They don't look that way while telling memories. No bro, its memories. He's telling memories, now. The way Khalil is laughing his head off, either it's not a memory, or if it is, it's a memory back from their childhood. What are you doing? It's fine. Were it OK, I'd remove it myself. It's hot; it's itchy. Bothers me. OK, don't touch it. - What's the bet if they're not telling memories? - What's the bet? I'd say he's telling memories. - What's the bet? - A noogie. No, noogies get the brain racked with pain; awful. No, bro. We'll give each other noogies and our heads swell up. It's cool touching it, then. No man; a slap in the face? No, bro. If it's slaps, it should be ten slaps. Either one noogie or ten slaps. He's telling memories; a hundred percent sure. I already told him we should get a gift or something for Majid's engagement. He says it should be a low-priced gift in case they don't reach a deal. - What do you mean 'they don't reach a deal'? - It's engagement, by the way. A low-priced gift so that if Majid and his fianc√© didn't end up getting married, we wouldn't lose anything. That's how Hassan is! He won't speak properly. Aziz, whatever you do, it shouldn't take more than five minutes. I've closed the water gate valve. You saw the pipes and stuff in the back of the car. Let's go fix it. So, I'll first bring up the issue of Sahar and the hospital and being short of money, then you'll cut me off saying it's no problem and that you'd borrow money from the guys to sort out the problem and then we'd pay back the money little by little. Then, I'll give him the money. He shouldn't find out about his brother at all. If he does, he'll reveal it to his mum and it'll turn into a fuss. Hassan will then go mad and won't calm down. - OK, sure. Is Majid in the loop? - Yes, I told him first. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Sir, your carrot juice is ready. Hassan! - Yes, sir, I know! yours is just carrot juice. - Mine is just carrot juice. Hassan, shake a leg dear. It's getting late. - Thanks - You're welcome, enjoy. Be quick Hassan. I've closed the water gate valve... Collect these. ...I've bought a pipe in the car and should be back in five minutes. Oh, you got these things because your home's pipes are broken? Yep. You know, Hassan thought you've started a new business with Aziz. You're kidding me, Doctor? - Call yourself 'doctor'. But, clarify this. - Doctor or medical student Clarify this. Listen... you were just standing here with Aziz; he was telling your childhood stories... We're too old for that stuff. Aziz made us linger in the yard for one full hour. He was praying for his family! - It's just started. He's taken us to the old bazaar; guess for what? - Just a moment, what's this? What's this? Hassan... Man, I'm saying while you were standing here, Aziz... Aziz was reminding you of your school memories and you laughed your head off... wait a moment! you laughed your head off. - You've bet on it? - Yes. A noogie. Don't do that. Don't give each other so many noogies. You'll go crazy. Aha... here, a hair clips for Aziz' daughter. She'd ordered one with flowers on it; - and the flowers should be made of fabric, not painted. - Dear! Khalil! Your kids have come of age and you've forgotten them being kids. They have thousands of different demands. So you think when they come of age, they'll have no more demands? God bless their childhood! Guys, I've closed the water gate valve and have got to go. Safe travel back to Tehran... but drop by again. If you excuse me, I've got to go. Don't you give us a ride? Do you have your suitcases with you? No... but no problem. You'll drive us to Dokouheh and we pick our suitcases there. If you're in a rush, we'll go ourselves. I was talking, Khalil. What rush, man? He's been saying he's in a rush since morning. Were he in a rush, he would be gone by now. Man, he's too kind to leave his buddies and go. He said either I'll give you a ride or I won't let you go! Are you serious? This is a real buddy; well done! Hassan, Majid, cut it out. I'll take you to Dokouheh; you'll pick your suitcases and I'll give you a ride to the train station, okay? Hey, photographer! Guys, let's take a group photo now that we're sitting here. Bro, would you take our photo? - What for? Let go of me... Who takes a photo while dripping with sweat? - What's the photo for? We were talking No need, sir; thanks. We'd better take a shower or a bath before taking photos. Whatever kids ask for is OK as long as they're safe and sound. Once, Sahar had gotten ill. We took her to the hospital. Our life was a mess. Man, put money into everything you like but don't throw it at the doctors; it's extortion money! Doctor... he means you. Yes. It's not pocket money. I was finally strapped for cash and borrowed from the guys. - Khalil remembers. - Really? Why didn't you let us know? Khalil, the guys all chipped in to pay for Sahar's hospital expenses, and then I paid them back bit by bit. Why did you borrow from the guys while I was around? Yeah, after all, when you run into a problem, you first fill in your buddies; then pay them back bit by bit. It's not my cup of tea. You know, there is no way we borrow from anyone even if worse comes to worst, cause the guys themselves are in plight up to their neck and you can't borrow money from them. Up to their neck, Hassan? These days everybody is in plight up to their eyeballs. - It doesn't feel right to ask people for money. - It's not fair, you know. He says up to their neck, you say up to their eyeballs? Where are you Khalil? Where am I? Hassan! Listen up. Why should I listen up? I want to talk to you, listen up. About what? You're cut out for role-playing, Khalil. What role? Stop laughing, Majid; stop. Please, Majid; what is it? He's completely out of here. What are you laughing at? I'm laughing at myself. Fall silent! Hassan, this is the whole story. No need to be shy. When you're in need and short of money, you should borrow from your friends and pay them back bit by bit. And you're brother called, by the way. Don't give out his bro's story. You don't laugh. Come one, I'll fill you in. - Why did my bro call? - He'll let you know. - You said my bro called you. - He'll tell you. Okay, he'll tell you Yes, he called. Come on, I'll tell you. - Where are you? - Right here! The thing is I hate cooking up schemes. What's wrong with telling him frankly? Come on; it's getting late. Shake a leg! It was delish Hassan. Move it, Majid. The hair clips... the hair clips... The Lost Strait In the name of God... Salehi, the division's deputy commander asked me to talk to you. The moment they said our battalion has got to go to the frontline, God knows_I told him too_I said we're back from several weeks of defence. The guys are going home. Their families are awaiting them in Tehran. I said lots of our guys are injured. We haven't had time to even hold memorial service for our newly-martyred friends. The voice of our brothers who've been left behind, in the past few weeks, and we haven't been able to take them back is being echoed in Dokouheh rooms. These halls, these walls, these rooms of Dokouheh; is it possible for them to forget the sufferings of the boys? Salehi said himself that it's your call, by the way. But the thing is, a few hours ago, Iraq has crossed the border. They've crossed through many of our border posts. They've used chemical weapons and taken captives. Folks have become homeless. Masses of soldiers are returning from the frontline. Salehi is going to Dehloran right now. We'll go there to be coordinated too. Despite all this, I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, whoever has a problem or difficulty to deal with and can't come along, may leave. The buses are at the military base yard for those who want to return to Tehran. You can go back with your mission papers or leave sheets. And those who want to come to the frontline must pick arms in a flash. Come on guys. Recite a Salavat. "Peace be upon Muhammad and his progeny" We were once flustered in the barricades. You couldn't even poke your head. Salehi was standing by a tank upright, as if we weren't under an all-out attack. He'd tell the tank crew to target this and that... Such a man leading the others off to the frontline means a grave situation. The guys were about to leave. It's hard for them. Talk to them. No one should come to the frontline to stand on ceremony. You'll have your own position, the company commander? No man, I can't be the commander. It makes me sleepless. - I'd better be in charge of myself. - Khalil! What is it? You're still in plain clothes? - I'll suit up in no time, sir. - You'll suit up? Can you come over for a minute? Ahmad has a word with you. - Where? - Upstairs. Lend me your ears Ali. You'll go room by room and tell everyone to write their names on their bags so that we know whose bag is which if they're martyred. - Get a move on. - OK, sure. Where is Khalil himself, by the way? What do you have to do with Khalil? You keep saying Khalil, Khalil... I'm Khalil's franchiser myself. Move it and do your job. Bro, it doesn't fit your left foot cause it's for the right foot. Bros, write your names on your bags so we know whose they are when you're martyred. - What do you mean? - It's the new trend? - I've got no idea. He said so. - Mohammad, why do you have this guy on? - Forget it, where's Mojtaba? - He said he took his bag with him to the town in the morning. He had some work to do there and was supposed to go to the station afterwards. I came to take my bag, too. Tehran's train will run in half an hour. Yep. I want to know if you're leaving, or staying. - What's your plan? - I don't know. Sharifi, they provide us with only half of our need list and say they don't have the rest, It's not even clear where we're heading; How can they send them? When they say they'll send it, they'll send it. You'd better calm down. I can't do anything. - How are you? - Hello. Habib, you're down again? Your team won the game! You're worried you won't keep it up in August? - Look at you. Not a care in the world. - Look, we've got Farshad Piyous, no worries. I'm busy, dear. Don't forget cherry compotes. This is the rainy day they talk about. Where are you Ali? Looking for Khalil. Hurry up; he's upstairs. Mohsen, Mohsen Bahari He's the son of a friend of mine in the war zone. His dad severed his spinal cord there and has been bed stricken for 3 years now. His mum trusted me with him. I promised his mum that he'll be safe. Now that we're going to the frontline, I thought he'd better stick to you and carry the injured. You promised his mum he'll be safe? Well, I thought he'd only do photography at the garrison. - This is Ali. He'll accompany you. - Hello I'll go to the telecommunication office to see if it's possible to make a call. - You want to call home and say what? - Nothing; they might have something to say. Hello I'm supposed to be in your unit, but I haven't found Khalil yet. Why do you want to come along to the frontline? I'd like to see the war up close, do photography, help you carry the injured... What's carrying the injured? Any ideas? Don't know exactly, but I'll learn. Some think that God helps soldiers to advance, so when they're shot and injured, they just stand and watch. Carrying the injured means you shouldn't let them think that way. You should pick up the injured and take them back. What do you mean? I don't get it. It's too early for you to leave the Propaganda Unit. Those willing to save the others should save themselves first. Imagine there's a chemical attack here. Can you wear a chemical mask? - Yes. - You can't. I swear I can. Come here. Bahari! Bahari! Yes Hand in a mask to this gentleman. Go downstairs and fetch one yourself and wear it right in front of me. Here, you'll see him down there. Majid, have some pistachios. Your pistachios are always closed. But its nut is great! Put it between your teeth; this way... You'll ruin your teeth, then. Nothing will happen! Doctor, seems like they're looking for you at the telephone exchange building. A lady has called from Tehran. Mostafa, pick up the relief backpack, the bandages and bring them downstairs. Get whatever you can from other battalions too. We shouldn't be short of anything in the frontline. Sure, doctor. Where is your bag? I swear to the Quran if it weren't for my mum, I wouldn't go back to Tehran. OK, where's your bag? Don't you want to make a phone call? - Call who? - Who? Me! Call her and say what? Didn't you say that you'd go today? She's awaiting you. - Come on; don't change the subject. - It's just a phone call, man. Move it, man, aww... Go give the the money Aziz has collected for you to your mum, - straighten up the situation and come back. Get it. - The train set off. The train set off? You'll go by bus. Get it. Lo OK, I don't know who Aziz has borrowed from to collect this money. Never you mind who he's borrowed from. I might not like him to borrow from some guys... Those who've lent the money don't know who it is for. We'll round up some money and pay them back bit by bit. Get it and put it in your bag. OK, I will. Hold on a second. Man, take it from me, aw... I said I'd take it... hold on a second! You're making such a scene. I want to send you on your way and say a proper goodbye; then I'll go. - You've been waiting since then to say goodbye? - Yes. What was this? The bet was a noogie, right? What bet? Near Dez river; the bet was a noogie and you lost. I had to give you the noogie. Didn't you say noogies get on my nerves and the bet would be slaps? Me? OK... so... if you'd like it, I can slap you in the face. OK, let me give you the noogie you gave me, then we'll come to slaps... You're so cheeky! Lo OK bro, when one is leaving, you should go kiss them goodbye. OK, I'll kiss you next time. I've got a question, by the way. - Aren't you sharper than me? - So? - Can't you speak better than me, and so on? - So? see, your wife is waiting in Tehran... too. You'll go instead of me and straighten up my situation too. Go. Go man; I'm changing clothes. OK, I'll go there and hit everyone. Go hit everyone. Go. You never listen to my suggestions. I've told you a dozen times but you don't care, no matter what I say. Majid! Majid! Khalil, wait a second so I take a photo of you with this building. No need. Here, give it to them. Let's take a group photo with the battalion, then. What's it good for? It's a memento, Khalil. Here, take this as well. What are you doing here? I'm saying goodbye; goodbye man; goodbye. One hour to say goodbye? Go; go. All right, forget about the building. Let me take a photo of you with the truck. Hold on a second; hold on. Guys, those up there, stand upright, and those down here, stand in a row so he takes a photo. He's killing me! Thank you, sir. Don't do that, Hassan... Hassan... - Habib! come here... - What's up? We're taking a photo. Not the right time to take photos. - Ready? - One, two... Smile guys; those up there, smile! You come too. Be quick! One, two, three... Come on guys! Where to? Aziz, don't go Move it guys; go. Get going, man; hit the road. Go. Go. This way; quick; go... Move on; move... Don't stop. Hurry up... Come on... Move... Why have you all bunched up over there? Are you watching a movie? Mohsen, would you like sunflower seeds? Sa'eed, Ali, either turn this way or sit up straight. Mr. Mostafa Torkaman... ain't I talking to you? Sit up, guys. Don't you think these guys who are going back would fill embarrassed the way you're staring at them? Why are they going back? They're injured... women and kids, where can they stay? They've ravaged the area with chemical bombs. - Why don't we use chemical bombs? - It's haram. For them, it's halal; but for us, haram? Using chemical weapons is unmanly. Ali, take care of the beans. Chemical bomb or whatever, they're mostly walking and lots of them have guns; why are they on the run? - Ali! - Yes, sir. Come here; show me your shots. let's see what you've got. It's ruined. Enough with the nagging; come here. Watch out the eating cloth. What are you doing? You're straightening out how we should get on with you. - For the photos? - The photo isn't my concern. Are you our soldier or a court judge who issues verdicts for all? Sir, when the enemy is advancing, everyone should stand up against them to their last breath. Why are they running away? We don't issue verdicts here; you should not either. I swear, they're scared. It's clear they're scared. Mind your own business. What's it to you? Let me see your photos. When you don't know the ins and outs of something, why do you judge it? You have no idea what's going on up the road. Whatever; they've come here to fight. Why are they backing down? Ali, why do you make judgements like this? Guys, forget it! Never take photos while moving. Guys, no one will move from his place before we arrive. OK? Aziz, sing a song to change the guy's mood. Quiet! Rock the truck! Run... Run... Quick... Move back... Good God! We're stuck. Sir, shouldn't we go forward? Why don't they open the road? They'll open it. Aziz, they're jammed. We're stuck. Check it out! Have some compote. Majid, look here, Majid... Here Mohammad, have closed pistachios. Agha-Seyyed, the dump truck suits you. It's made you handsome! You're on your way to Tehran... right? Hi bro; I came to say goodbye. I'll go back. Have some compote! Hassan... - I swear on your life. I'll return at the intersection. - Hassan... Their armoured forces are advancing from several roads. From this side, they've approached Abu-Quraib but haven't occupied the strait yet. - Why are you mooching around? Where's Nader? - I'll go get him. What's going on here Mohammad? Why are they all at sixes and sevens? Have some guys fix the situation. It's not just here. The roads are all blocked. What do you mean they're all blocked? As you open up a road; it gets jam-packed like this and blocked again. - Take the dirt road, then. - The land is all sandy. They can't. Those who've gone are stuck too. This is the only road. So, what's this? What's it doing here? - Pull over a couple of cars with it. - It's out of kilter itself. What's wrong with this? Push it away, so it doesn't block the rest of the road. - Who's up the road? - Division 77 of the army. Their commander said he wouldn't let anybody pass as long as he's alive. Their pressure is on the strait. If they pass the strait, they'll occupy the moor thoroughly and advance to cities. I go to the frontline along with Salehi. Keep your eyes open. - Sir, the loader is here. - All right, then. Keep an eye on them yourself. - Go help them. Run! - Run, guys! ...The enemy's strike is very heavy. We can't move. There are a lot of injured people... I'm saying right now just Ammar Battalion is with me. It's not complete, of course. they're stuck here at the three-way intersection. It's not clear when they'll be freed and make it to the frontline. Lo OK, if the strait is left unattended, the Ba'ath army will cross it. You can't control the strait with one battalion. - What are Habib's guys doing? - They've moved to their left side. The ring road was under fire. I said not to move till the ring road's issue resolves. Did I tell you or not? Who let them relocate? Let's go, Sir. Where's your mum? Who's kid is she? Hi What are you doing here? Why did you get off? Go get on. - I'm taking photos of the guys. - Don't take photos. Go get on. Aziz! Aziz! Habib, start the car, move. This car has broken down and blocked the road. Let's help move this car. Sir, give us a hand. One, two, three... Go... Make somewhere for these kids who lost their parents, spread a blanket for them. Next to the free-food booth. Quick! Who are this kid's parents? Who are this kid's parents? Who are this kid's parents? Who are this kid's parents? Whose kids are they? Madam, keep an eye on your children. Come on boy, Where are your parents? Come here! Take care of these kids. Hassan, I found somewhere for them. Take them away. Where are your parents? ...And in order to have good faith we should sacrifice everything we have. And to sacrifice everything, we need to keep God in mind and heart, day and night. This is the last one. Take it. Would you like to take the sacks too? They need water. They're all looking for water. - Guys should wait; ladies first; and kids... - Make way ma'am..... - What's in the other car? - Only ammo. Oh, gosh! They're used up. Put them aside. Gather things up. - Bro, put them in order, please. - Sure - Where are you, Ali? - I'm giving some stuff to these kids, sir. - Keep an eye on us. As soon as the road is opened, we'll depart. - OK, sure. ...It's for you. Wait... - Even 50 tankers of water wouldn't suffice them. - OK, let's go back ourselves and bring more. The road is blocked. Here, dear. Grab some. Grab some, dear. - Please give me one. - Grab more, dear. Take it. - Please one more... - Gimme one more, please. The tankers here have run out of water. - Where are our tankers? - In the road. Didn't you see Khalil? Guy... nobody should pass by the front or behind the loader. Ali! What are you doing, bro? Move back. - Ali - Yes, Sir. - Go to our own guys so I know where you are. - OK, Khalil. Come on... Come backwards, come on... Oh, my God! Is he still alive? He's been martyred. Are you okay? I'm fine. - Where's your injury? - It's not a big deal. - Hold it. - He was conscious already. OK, stand by the road so that they take you back when the road is opened. - All right; what about my buddy? - Go bro, I'll take care of him. Ali, Ali, pick up a relief backpack and follow me. I've run out of supplies. Get a move on! Move along. Why are you staring at me? Go... Bro, give me a relief backpack. Give me a relief backpack. Ali, Ali! - Ali! Ali! - Yes, sir. Yes Give me a hand to take this guy. Gently, gently... he's unconscious. - Where's your camera? - In the dump truck, sir. - So, you didn't take photos of the chemical attack victims? - No Now you understand why we don't use chemical weapons? Little by little, you should learn to take photos of what you detest too. - Bro, can you come forward yourself? - My eyes are closed. I can't see anywhere. Ali, help him out. Drop it on my shoulder gently. - Bro, give us a hand yourself too. He's a child. - Put your hand on my shoulder. Start the engine... Did you see what you wanted to see up close? Madam, bring that kid by the chopper. Get a move on; hurry up. Stretcher, stretcher... He's unconscious. Gently, take him. Ali, his pulse isn't normal. - Ali! - Yes, sir. Yes. Come here. What are you gazing at? Go get an IV. Run! Can you? Come on... Run... - Can you? - Yes, sir. Go ahead. - Make way... - Make way, sir... Quick sir; hurry up! He's unconscious. Give him an IV. An IV... Come over here, come here. Get a move on, run... Be quick. Move towards the moor. Go... Ali, Ali, Ali... Why are you shocked? Move along... No one should be on the road. Everybody move towards the moor; move towards the moor. Move towards the moor. Jump down. Come on. Move along... Jump down. Jump down. Go... Habib is a big fan of Persapolis. He'd stored all blue underpants and vests in the Procurement warehouse, and didn't give them to the guys to wear them. He went there again and again, and struggled with him so much that Habib brought those blue clothes and gave them to the guys. Only he himself could deal with Habib. The division was infected with scabis Hold it tight, here ...they'd take the guys to Karkheh Military Camp, and mix gunpowder and medicine in these pots-like soup- and rub it all on their bodies. Then, they'd make them lie down in the sun. He'd been infected by scabis and they'd taken him there. He'd call it the Scabious Land. Whoever came from there, he'd say, "he's come from Scabious Land. Why are you like this? So indifferent! Do you hear what we say? Can't you hear? - Can't you hear? - He can't hear. His ears are whistling. It's whistling non-stop. It doesn't let me hear. It'll be fine. It's for the explosion. What? It's because of the bomb, the explosion. It'll be fine. It's not even half an hour from the explosion. When people live well, they die well too. They won't be dependent on anything, even their life. Their death is like passing through the door. No need to mourn for them. In the battelion's building, I was about to go tell Aziz "thank you for the money", but I felt shy. Then, while he was standing next to the truck, I told myself, "go and kiss his face now and thank him." but I said I'd tell him in a better place. While we were putting him in the ambulance, I kissed him and said, "Thank you Aziz". I'm such a fool. I should've gone over there and told him already. I told you to just tell memories. Now, Aziz must be weeping for our miseries. Hamed Azizi, Mohammad Imani, Ali Yousefi... Hey! Stop! Hi. Pull over and get off. Take out whatever you have. Don't leave anything behind. Hey! Stop! Come on guys! - Don't stop. Get going... - Hamed, take this... (Islamic call to worship) I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God. (Islamic call to worship) Khalil, what should I do? - Did you take ablution? - I'll do now. Davoud! Go tell the guys to leave all their unnecessary stuff here. We'll just take ammos to the frontline. Sure, Sir. Let's see what they've brought already. - Khalil, what should I do? - Like I said. Take ablution, dear. Davoud! Come here... May God accept your prayers. Help yourselves. Why the long face? Man, no matter how much I tell Khalil, he won't listen. His hearing is po or. You should yell for him to hear. For God's sake talk to him so he lets me come to the frontline. Don't tease me. Have some watermelon. Don't sing the blues. - Hello. - Hello... sir. Sit down, please. Hello. Help yourself to watermelon. Enjoy! May God accept your prayers. - Hello. - How are you? Let me see you. What's happened? No big deal. I was with Masoud and the others... Gargle salt water till morning. Your infection shouldn't spread. I'll check my backpack now. If I have pills, I'll bring them for you. Majid, Khalil says I mustn't go forward any further. He says I have to stay here. I ask why and he says you've said so. Your mum had asked Aziz to take care of you. If you go to the frontline and something happens to you, Aziz won't evoke good memories for her. I'm not a kid. Nothing will happen. - What's going on at the frontline? - Salehi is just back from reconnaissance. He's here now. The guys told me about Aziz. Esmaeel, here boy. Distribute the food among the guys if anything's left. Sir, we ran out of food at the three-way intersection. There's just a little dried bread and watermelon. - The army soldiers took it for their guys... - Dish out whatever has remained. Go. OK, sure. Come here Khalil, come. O God! I don't know how to tell his family. - Esmaeel, we aren't here for more than 20 minutes. Hurry up! - Sure, sir. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello sir. - Hello. Hello Come on in. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello everyone. - Hello. Welcome. - Sir, sorry to put you out at this time. - No problem, make yourselves at home. Come on in. Hello. Hello. Come on in, please. - Hello madam. Sorry to put you out. - Hello. Welcome. What happened? It's over in two minutes. Help yourselves to the food. Good appetite. We've eaten already. - Saleh! - Yes. Tie this up to that tree. If I were fearful, I would've been feared at the three-way intersection. And I'm still safe and sound. You're telling me to go to the procurement warehouse. If I wanted to carry around bread and water, I would've stayed in town. - You were supposed to come to the frontline to take photos. - OK, you let me come forward, I'll just take photos. - Rahim, here; take this pill. It'll calm you down a bit. - Thank you. - Majid, lend me your ears for a minute. - To wear a chemical mask in Dokouheh, you kept everyone waiting for half an hour. Please don't quarrel with me any more. I knew that. I just got in a fluster that day. Hey kid, you'll come to the frontline and get in a fluster again ...having yourself killed, as well as the others who are trying to save you from the trouble. - You mean it's worse than today? - Yes, it is. It's war. Everything is possible. Excuse me, Habib. This gentleman will help you from here on. Pick up the water and take it to the guys quickly. - Say, "Yes, sir!" - That one? - Yes, shake a leg! - Habib, just a moment. I'll tell something to Majid and be back soon. - Be back quickly. - I'll be back right now. Majid, hold on a moment. That's all right. Does anybody have the know-how in pick-up trucks? Where's Rahim? Ignite the engine again. It might start. Come on! Akbar... Did you check the water and oil? Cut it out. Akbar; shake a leg. It's getting late. Ehsan, take these barricade sacks. Rahim, don't bother yourself. This car won't start. Bro... we've got some equipments but our car is broken. We're going to the frontline. We need your car. Just leave the key... please. Somebody help me take these guys out. Quick. Sir! Sir, I'm talking to you. Hold his leg tight, hold it tight. Sir, Hey, I'm talking to you! I heard you. The car has been officially handed over to me and I won't give it to anyone. - What do you say? Who are you? - I said we need to take the equipment to the frontline. Hey! Bring a gallon! Sir, listen to what I'm saying... - I said we should go to the frontline. The guys are in need of the stuff. - I've run out of gas. I've got to go back. Don't fear, okay? Majid, these are all excuses. You fear to lose the war, tomorrow. Wars have no winner, Ali. Only those who are selling weapons are the winners. Mind you, we aren't fighting; we're defending our home and family. Don't mix up the two. If you mean the Ba'ath army crossing the strait, yes, they might cross it but first off they need to cross our corpse. That's impossible. I'm just back from reconnaissance. Their armoured division is behind the strait. They aren't moving because of the dark. They're arming their tanks. They won't remain there in the morning. I understand but there's nothing else we can do at the moment. - Help yourself sir. - Give it to the guys. You don't get my point. I've talked to a dozen people since morning. They say Abu-Ghoraib site is more important than anywhere else. They haven't put their pressure on the strait for no reason. They want to cross the strait and make it to Dasht-e-Abbas. If they reach there, they'll advance non-stop afterwards. It will be over. Hold on to the strait for a few hours. Co ordinate with the artillery guys to give you a hand. We're putting ourselves out. We're in a dire situation here. - You've put all your attention on other points. - I can't copy you... - I said you're not caring about the strait any more. - That's not the case, bro. Listen! Inform Abbas that I'm here, near the strait, with Ammar's boys I know the situation you're stuck in. Sir, help yourself. Where's Abbas himself? Haven't seen him since noon. If I see him, I'll tell him to join you. The Ba'ath army has launched an all-out attack. We're under heavy fire. - Nothing can be done empty-handed, you know. - Yes, copied. - Leave the key in the car and go. - Keep your voice down! I won't give the car to anyone. Look, the guys are on edge. They'll get off and make a scene. The guys should face a whole tank division with empty hands. They can't bicker with you over a DShK. From where did you pop up? You're the commander? It's not your business who I am. if you want to leave, you can leave! but the car will stay here. If I wanted to go back, why would I be here? Moreover, how do you know I'm going back? Well... your car is heading this way. My car's direction isn't your business. Look! tomorrow, I'll be at the strait before you. Fine if you're not going back. No need to hit the roof. As soon as you said your prayers and had a bite, pack and get ready; time to go. - Let me do that. - No need. We're fed up with this doctor and pick on you. Who's the doctor? The doctor of Saddam's mum. You know her story, right? She goes to the doctor for abortion. I don't know why exactly. Then, the doctor talks her into keeping the baby and she gives birth to Saddam. We're going through all this misery because of that doctor! He ruined everything! I told Akbar to hold back his unit here to build barricades so he can confront them here if they pass the strait. Esmaeel, you take your boys to the strait's right flank. You settle on the left flank in a way that their foot soldiers can't cross the rolling terrain. God willing, reinforcements will be here by morning. Stand up guys. Dispatch your men now. Move it. Hurry up! Khalil! Where's the artillery, Reza? In the morning, they'll wipe us out. What can we do? Watching them pass the strait? No, let's take a group photo with all of us in it... It'll come handy. Hassan! Hassan, come on, let's go. I want to plant the watermelon seeds here to check if they sprout by the time we're back. What? They planted the seeds and we ate the fruit, now we plant for the others! Move it, move it. Pick up as much ammo as you can. Move at a distance of 6 feet from each other. Quick! fill your canteens with water. - Ali! - Yes, sir. Get a move on! Don't forget the water. the canteens should be filled with water... We're leaving. - Oblige yourself to be of help to Habib. - Sure. Colemans, canteens... Don't hold these back, OK? They have to be distributed all. Ali, you didn't see the war, after all... Take care. Get going. Why are you standing there? - Ali! - Yes, sir. Give them as much ammo as you can. Goodbye sir. Move! Shake a leg, unload the car. What are you doing? Where do you think they're going that you've given all your attention to them? We were all one team. If we want to go anywhere... we should go all together. When I was your age... I'd run after my dad's horse out in the plains. It's now the time for you to play around, boy. What are you doing here? My dad has been bed stricken for three years now I couldn't go horse riding with him. My apologies! Stand up! Move! Hurry up. Faster. Hurry up Mind your distances. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on guys Hurry up. Move! If something happens to you, the guys would be out of spirits. If you come back, we might be able to put together some reinforcements at the headquarters and dispatch them to the strait. Sir, you're the division's deputy commander. You shouldn't go to the frontline. You could come in handy here more. Take these ammo boxes forward. Stand up! Let's send some of the guys to the moor near the enemy tanks. - OK, send some volunteers. - I'll send my guys. Talked to them already. Why are you sitting here? Come on. Move it. Don't you see their shooting? - Reza, what should I do? - Stay here. I'll be back and tell you. You'll go back from here, right? Your toothache went away and you started snide remarks? At your service, sir! They keep pounding us non-stop and don't let us do our job. Davoud, come on! Come on! Give me the shovel and help me out. Pour some soil over that plate so it's heavy. You're building a hospital for them, Majid? Do your own job. Majid, Ali won't back down at all, by the way. - Ali? Where's Ali? - He'd come to the frontline with procurement guys. I suppose he's changed Habib's mind. Habib, wait a second! Habib let me come forward and go back with him. Why the hell did you come here without your superior's permission? You made a big mistake... Ali! Ali! Ouch! Ouch! My hand... My hand... Hassan! Get into the canal. Get into the canal. Get into the canal. Hassan! Saleh! Come down. Get into the canal. Majid, get into the canal. Get into the canal. Get into the canal. Ali! Ali! Ali, get out. Where are you going? Where are you going? Calm down! Don't be scared. Everything's fine. It's not your blood. Calm down. Where was he shot? He's been shot. Where were you shot? Can you stand up on your feet? Run. Move it! Move forward. Go forward everyone! Where's Hassan? And Ali? - Has Ali come forward? - Yes, on the procurement car. - They say Hassan has been shot near the tanker. - Hassan's been shot? Come on! Where are you going? Move along! Go forward. Duck your heads! Run! Majid! Come here! come here. Come on, Majid. Move along! Run... Come on, Khalil! Run faster. Run. Run faster. Run. Run faster. Run. Run faster. Run. Run. Pick him up. Come on. Run faster. Run. - Esmaeel, Khalil, Sharifi, come here. - Coming. Come here. Look Esmaeel, take your men to the end of this canal and turn up on their right flank. Khalil, you go to the left side of their tanks. I'll go near the road to make it to the moor. Their pressure on the strait might be reduced this way. Quick, guys... Stand up, man. Why are you sitting? Run... Come on... Come on Move it - What's wrong? - He's just been married. He's scared to move on. Go, I'll take him. Stand up, dear. While in Tehran you longed for martyrdom; now that you're here... you're afraid? Move. Here's under fire! Run... Majid! Pick him up. Pick him up. Yell out. Don't hold it in. Yell out. The Coleman's got no water. It's got no water... - We should die of grief for you to show up? - Doctor, he won't yell out. You should go on with the monkey business here to o? Where has he been shot? Nothing, he's just a bit dirty. Talk so he knows you're fine. Enough Hassan! - What's wrong with your leg? - Nothing. - Don't give me such a hard time. - Why are you wearing black? - Hassan, now that you're here don't skip out at least. - Sure. Bring him in. Hassan and Ali are here, Khalil. Yes, I saw them. I told them to sit here myself. Ask them to bring some water The guys will give in without water. From where should they bring water? The road is under fire Saber, find Rasool and go into the canal. I'll join you too. Hassan! Hassan! Come on! we should move towards their machine gun barricade. Majid... Ali is coming. Go. Yell out and go... Come over here beside me. Where are you going? Sit down there. He's heading out again without permission. Sit down! Here, everyone who gets scared will die sooner. Have this. Be cautious. Sit down there. Rasool! Rasool! Majid! Ali! Ali! Sit down there. Put him here. Oh, my God! Breathe... Breathe... Cough... Cough... Hands off the wound! - M2 Machine Guns are shooting from three of their barricades. - What? Come here. One of their barricades is right behind us. They're pounding the road from this side, and have approached our left side's earthwork. Say one by one. I can't catch on. Saber, come here. Take care of the rear barricade. What's wrong? If you want to cry, go to Tehran and mourn for a whole year. Tough it out here. - Hassan, don't act silly. Don't engage rashly. - OK, I'll go around them. - Where are you coming? - Majid says to disperse in the moor. They've gained the hospital's coordinates and pounded it. Go behind the barricades. Hassan! Come here; come here. - You've got any water? - No No, I only have Coke! We should storm their tanks straight. - Guys, have you got water? - No. - Go. What did I tell you? - We should storm their tanks. Sharifi! It's blocked here. - Are you OK? - No, I'm fine. Go help Khalil. Khalil, I'm here. Let's take the injured back. Be quick, pick him up. Be quick. Where are you coming? Pound the hilltop! Their snipers are on the hilltop. Hassan says we can't advance from that side. - We have to storm their tanks straight. - Sharifi! Sharifi! Sharifi... get some water. The boys are out on their feet. They're shooting individuals with their tanks. The strait opening is blocked. It's under fire. God willing, water will arrive. Let it go. Stand up. Sharifi... the injured have remained back here. - Where's Hassan? Is he fine? - Yes, he's in the barricade over... Khalil, can you send the injured back form over the flanks? Shoot, Davoud. Bravo! Go help Esmaeel. Qasem... Morteza, come over here, here. Hit the left one. Catch up to Khalil's unit and tell him Yazdi says someone should come here to engage. - Stand up. Go up there. - My throat... Stand up. Water's on the way. Come on... Damn it! Hassan, where are you? Here. Come to the earthwork. They won't let go, man. We made it to the moor so they give up the strait. The more we pound them, the more they become. Majid, where are the bandages? There was some stuff behind the artillery. Is Ali speaking? - I don't know. The jerks hit the same point again. - Let me take a look. You talk so much rubbish that it hit your jaw straight. They're all signs. Really? So, it was a sign when it'd hit that part of your body and left a mark too? Now you're talking rubbish. Well done! Stand up. They'll be running us over. Stay away from the earthwork. Don't stay there! Ali! Ali! Ali! What are you up to here? Run! Run! Go. Majid is beside you. Watch out. No one should be left behind here. If you come across any injured, tell me where they are. - Two guys were left behind the earthwork. - OK, we'll go get them. Take one of his hands and bring him here quickly. Come on. Majid! Assad is on your left side. Get there. Don't come here again. Rahim, stand up. Majid's hand is injured! He can take care of himself. You cover me so I can go see if there's any ammo. What do you mean? Get hold of this See in which direction the others are shooting, you shoot in the same direction too. What happened? Wait. I'm coming to take you over there What are you doing? Give it to me. Hold this straight. Watch its kick. Hold it tight. Be careful not to shoot me from behind and blast my head. - You should shoot this way. - OK, I'm careful. Can I go? - Yes. - OK, shoot before I go. Shoot! Shoot. Hurry up. Hurry up. Be careful not to leave ammos in the canal. I sent Nader over to you to tell you where to come. Nobody helped us. Their tanks have stopped. They aren't advancing. They didn't think they'd have so many casualties. If they start again, don't engage. The guys are planting mines on the road and the canal's edge. If they hit the mines, the road will be blocked. You should settle somewhere to open fire on them from behind if their tanks crash into each other. I gathered some guys in our left side. Where's Salehi? The artillery? Salehi was shot on the way to the headquarters. Their voice is in my head; all of them. Many didn't even have a slight injury. They were all thirsty Those innocent boys. I wish I won't remember anything, Reza. If their tanks start moving, no one should engage. Let them reach the canal and the anti-tank mines. When they're stuck there, we'll open fire on them from behind. If they're stuck, the guys will hit them from the strait as well. They've been of great use so far. What if they cross without being stuck? We'll let them go to the strait just like that? I don't think they'll move again. Lots of their tanks were hit. Were it day one of the war, yes. We'd target two of them and they'd run away. Now... it's different. They'll move again. What do you make of it, Ali? Will they move again? I've got no clue. What do you mean you've got no clue? Say something. Aren't you in our unit? Ali, if you know, please tell the truth to Khalil, bro. It's nothing like we've known this boy for one day. You've become one of the elders of this group. So where is your camera? You were supposed to take a couple of photos of us. The moment I entered the strait, the camera was smashed. Thank God it smashed. What's the point in having photos? Who takes a photo with such a face and look? Well... you'll take a bath or shower before taking photos... right? Ali, did you ever think you'd make so many cool friends one day? Where were we yesterday this time? Aziz, God bless his soul, was taking us around the bazaar to find a pink hair clips with flowers on it. And he said the flowers mustn't be painted, they must be made of fabric. His child had ordered so. Yesterday this time, we weren't at the bazaar. We were at the carrot-juice and ice-cream shop by the river. He's right. and you got in a fluster and my drink was left on the table. I couldn't drink half of it. Oh, I closed the water gate valve and left to buy a knee pipe and return in an hour. Someone would fix the pipe, after all and open the water gate valve. They won't leave it like that. Yes, someone would open the valve and fix the pipe. You'd better let me drink the carrot-juice to the end. That's a pity. I should've taken that. Run behind the earthworks. Move along... Come here! Hit it! The injured are behind the earthwork. Don't let it reach there. Hit it, Morteza. Bravo! Run over there. Move behind their tanks... Don't give in! They're running away! ...behind the canal... Clear the mines... ...should accompany the guys. You know the situation we're in... ...the important point is that the guys are worn out. Somebody should be with them... Leave me Alone! Hey Majid, come here! What is it... Morteza? The blast wave has hit Hassan. Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me. Hassan, what do you want? My gun. What do you want? My gun. All right, stay here; I'll give you a gun. Give me my gun. - I'll give you a gun. - Give it to me. OK, what do you want to do? Davoud is shot in the leg. He's bleeding. I'm such a dumb ox, I put him on a mule to send him back. He was shot and went down the valley with the mule. All right. All right. - Morteza is stuck in the snow. - All right, I'll go get Morteza. Get him. I beg you to get him. - My buddy is freezing. - Hassan! Hassan! Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me.... I'm standing next to the strait. I can see the moor. The Ba'ath troops are on the run. Their foot soldiers are running away.... Their tanks are retreating.... Do you copy? They're retreating.... Copy that.... Tell Ahmad that there's no pressure on the strait anymore. Iraq could have transferred its troops to Andimeshk and Dezful in case they had managed to cross the Abu-Ghoraib Strait and occupy Khuzestan, consolidating itself as the real winner of the war. Ammar Battalion, from the 27th Division, prevented it with empty hands and thirsty lips... changing the fate of the war in its last days. The story of these men was lost amid the official records of the last days of the war. Five days later, the UN'S 598 Resolution was signed between Iran and Iraq for a lasting peace.
