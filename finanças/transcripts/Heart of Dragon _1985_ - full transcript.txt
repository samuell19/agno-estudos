Producer: Leonard ho koon-cheung production manager: Chan pui-wah line producers: Wu ma, cai Ian, Barry wong ping-yiu run! Those bastards! Do they really want to blow us up? They don't even care about the hostages, let alone us! Let's take them out! Executive planner: Dick Cho kin-nam retreat. Director: Sammo hung kam-Bo spread out. Split up and find them. Hold on. Divide and conquer. Get them one by one. Yes. This can't be right. Based on my experience, one of them should be here. I knew you guys were nearby! Headquarters calling the SWAT unit, return to base! Old man is embarrassed. This practice course of the SWAT unit has been extremely successful. Because it has proven to me one thing. Our SWAT team is made up of a bunch of incompetent idiots! With the exception of members of the strawberry team who played terrorists, all other team members will cancel their two-week vacation for additional training! My aunt and my third cousin always tell me... To find a good boyfriend. But be sure not to find one in law enforcement. Tell me... all this time you've known me, have I ever asked you to change career? No. See? You always do as you please. You said “one,” I never said “two.” You said “turn right,” I never went left. You said you didn't like me to work in the bar, so I switched to the restaurant. A girl that's so obedient to you, have you ever considered spending the rest of your life with her? No... I mean yes! Yes. Since you said yes, when do you plan to propose to me? Don't know. What is it that you want? Are you planning on giving up on our relationship? Mind your words, I haven't yet taken you to the peak of our relationship, so how would I think of giving up on us? That's because you don't want to reach that peak. Hey! You're driving! Stop that. Welcome to our department. But you must remember, starting today, you're officially with c.1.D. Have a seat. Now... I don't care what a big shot you were when you were with the SWAT unit. With this transfer, you're starting from ground zero. Inspector wong. What's the matter with you? Haven't you ever heard of knocking? Go back out and knock this time! Seriously? Insp. Wong, the junkie we just hauled in is suffering withdrawal symptoms. He's just going through withdrawal. Get him on methadone. Wait a second. This is your new associate. Let him handle this one. Go with him. Methadone doesn't do a thing for me. A gallon of it wouldn't even cure my cough. Consider yourself lucky to get anything at all! Get up. He's here to take you to lunch. Car's waiting outside. Sir, if methadone worked at all, heroin wouldn't be so expensive. Keep moving. Big dummy, between women and cake, which one would you pick? Cake. - How about you, ming? - Cake, of course. I like my mom. We're talking about food. Can you eat your mom? My mom knows how to bake nice cakes. Everybody seems to like cake. I wonder why my brother prefers women. He's probably full. I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat in there. Good idea! Of course I know it's a good idea. But what about money? The food here is expensive! I have three dollars. Three dollars. I have two dollars. Two dollars. I have ten, but mom says it's for a pencil case. - Just tell your mom you've lost it. - I've lost it twice already! Big dummy, how about you? Me? I don't have any money. There's a hole in your pocket and you're not wearing underwear! Oh, I have a dollar! One dollar. 16 dollars, not enough for food. Thank you. They ate a whole table of food for just ten dollars! Are you sure? Yeah, I saw him paying. - How much did you tip? - Ten dollars. Are you joking? That much? Five would have been plenty. Five would've looked cheap. Five is enough! Let's go in... Yeah. Wait. We need a grown-up to take us in. What, then? Big dummy, you're so tall, you can be our dad for a little while. Hey, do you know what to do? I don't. You just keep scolding us as we walk in. You just say... “All you brats care about is food... “You're not so excited when it comes to homework!” Got it? Let's go. Hey, start scolding. All you brats care about is food... You're not so excited when it comes to homework. How many? This way. Have a seat. Sir, what would you like to order? He called me “sir”! I want ice cream. I want ice cream. Me too. Me too, and a spaghetti with meat sauce. I want pork chops. All you brats care about is food... You're not so excited when it comes to homework. Anything else? No more, no more. Big du... Father, the man asks if there is anything else you'd like to order. All you brats... Father says, there's nothing more. No more, no more. Ok. I still want to eat more. We better see how much we have left. Big dummy, get the bill. Waiter! Check, please! Coming. Thanks. That'll be $115.20. My father wants a cup of coffee. I don't want coffee. Coffee tastes bitter. I said you want coffee! One cup. One cup. We're in big trouble. Where do we get that much money? Big dummy, call your brother to come and pay them. But I don't remember my brother's phone number. Are you kidding? How can you forget your brother's number? Listen. You stay here, I'll go get your brother. - I need to go home. - I'll go with you. Sir, where are you going? I want to go home. Fine. Just pay the bill first. You're pretty generous. That's fine for tips. Now, please pay the bill. What's wrong? Boss, he doesn't want to pay. Are you trying to eat for free? I don't know. I just want to go home. Fine. Call the cops. No, don't... Don't let him get away. After him! - He's eating for free, catch him! - Don't run! Still want to get away? Tie him up! No! Die! Don't hit me. Stop hitting me! You're still trying to get away? Damn fat boy. Ate for free and think you can just walk away? Run away? You even brought a whole bunch of kids with you. And you've trashed my place! Stop running! Fat boy, come out of there. Open the door, fat boy. - Can't get it open. - Call the police. Fat boy! Come on. Hurry! - What are you doing? - Excuse me, I'm a cop. Hey kid, you can't come in. - I'm a cop. Where's my brother? - Inside. Thanks a lot. The fat boy ate and wouldn't pay. He's locked himself in the freezer. What do you want me to do? What do you want? I'm his little brother. Brother, open the door. It's tat. Open the door! You might as well save your breath. I'm sure he's frozen by now. Where's the power switch? Hurry up and turn off the power. No can do. The power switch is inside also. How about the main fuse? No use either. The freezer has its own generator... In case of power failure, it keeps going... To keep the meat from being ruined. What other entrances to the freezer are there?! No other entrances, but you can use the air ducts. Where is it, then?! Over there. Brother! Brother! Brother! Here they come. Please call an ambulance for me. Brother. Brother. Queers. I'm his little brother. My big brother. My big brother. My big brother. My big brother. Brother. Don't wipe your hand on the wall. See how dirty? Wait, that's even worse. Come on. Brother. Brother. Don't mess with other people's things. The goldfish can swim underwater... I've told you before to call me if you're in any trouble. But I've forgotten your telephone number. I'd better play it safe. I'll put my number on a plate and hang it around your neck. I'll have a day off soon. I'll take you to Chuck 'n' cheese. They have ice cream there too. But don't buy ice creams in the street, they're dirty. If you want ming to come, we can take him too. I'll give you two a ride. Don't go to the restaurant by yourself anymore, understand? Brother! You could drown! I'm just trying to teach rubber duckie to swim underwater. Don't bother. It already knows how. Why won't it sink? - Mr. fung. - How are you? Brother, your tutor is here. Come on out! Don't. There's no rush. Have a seat. Hurry. It's 50 dollars an hour. Make him earn his pay. Here, I'll give you a hand. Teacher. What's up? Finished your bath? Do you still remember the few english words I taught you yesterday? Yes. School. School bus. Write it down and show me. I have to go out now. You put effort into it. I want a soda pop. I'll buy you some when you finish your lesson. - Teacher. Thank you very much. - Don't mention it. It's my job. - Going out, uncle bing? - Yes. I made it! Sorry, uncle bing. Crazy. Teacher, I've finished. Write it ten more times. Teacher, can I write it tomorrow? My brother said I've only learned three words in a whole week's time. Three words? You think it was easy to teach you three words? Who do you think you are? A genius? You're more like an overaged preschooler! Let me give your brother $50 an hour to teach the cows in new territories to read! I have my own way of teaching! It's called “bilk and gyp.” Do you know what that means? I knew you wouldn't know! Just listen to teacher! You're wasting your time with learning. Just eat and sleep as much as you can. Don't waste your youth with studying. What is your age? Age? What's that? How old are you? 20-30 years old... But some people have told me I'm an idiot for a 30-year-old. They're right. You are an idiot. You haven't learned a thing after all these years. If you keep this up, you won't even be in the 5th grade when you're 50. Wouldn't you say you're wasting your youth? Then again, you don't have much youth left to waste. Crying? Using your tears to splash on me? Trying to make me feel guilty? Well, that's the way I am! Teaching you a few days a week makes only enough to bet on horses. As soon as the season is over, I won't tutor you even if you beg me. Forget it. Never mind. Take this lollipop. I don't want it. I want to learn! Now you're upset with me? Mr. fung. Now I'll teach you a new letter, h... This $100 will pay for the rest of this week. Now go. What's wrong, Mr. fung? Go! Little brother, I've really tried my best. I know. I'll find you another teacher. Let's go downstairs for a soda. - Time off? - No. Following a lead? I'm working, you want to get me fired? The manager is watching. Sir, what would you like? I would like to propose to you. It's not that I want to say no. But it's the wrong time and the wrong place for this. How can you propose to me with cemetery flowers? You want me to kill you with this knife? Then why do you guys put cemetery flowers on the tables? I don't want to talk to you anymore. You're not serious. Sir, take a look at the menu. Let's talk later, after work. I've received an offer from a shipping company to be a sailor. You want to quit your job to be a sailor? This has been my dream for the past 20 years. But you said you want to marry me! That's my dream for the next 50 years. Getting married and being a sailor are two things I've wanted all my life. Now it's all like a wind blowing in my direction. Life is indeed a beautiful feast. You wish... To get an indigestion! Appetizer is sailing on a ship, salad is marrying a beautiful girl. What about the main course? Main course is taking care of the big brother. Fung, you've certainly got it all figured out. One wife, one brother, one marriage. All taken care of in one shot. Killing two birds with one stone. Hey, what do... In addition... you're only getting married because you want to go sailing. What are you all doing here? You've ruined everything. What are we doing? I should ask you what you are doing. Jenny is so good to you. How can you treat her this way? Marry her and then leave her home to take care of your brother. You want to taste all the world's 'chickens'? What do you mean by 'chickens'?! Alright. Forget the 'chickens'. You tell me, what's wrong with being a cop? Being a cop... If you dare to say anything bad about being a cop, we will all be beating you up. He told me to. He also told you not to go work for the shipping company. I've always wanted to be a sailor, since I was a child. You're not a child anymore! Yet you still think like a child! Yeah. You only have a brother in this lifetime. How can you even think of walking out on him now? And, you only marry once too. How can you marry her and not stay to consummate the marriage, but go sailing instead? Consummate the marriage? When did you become so literate? What's so funny? Can't you be serious? I'm trying to teach him to be a good man. I'll punch you! We all only want what's best for you... You wouldn't want to let Jenny down, would you? Look, with you sitting right here she still gets treated like this. If you're not in Hong Kong, wouldn't she be in danger? With your temper now, you may kill someone. Let me handle this one. Don't be shy... Gentlemen, do you not know how to read? What are your qualifications? Oh, you even know english! So what if we do? And what if we don't? Well, if you didn't know how to read, you might think this western restaurant is a fishball stall. You're quite a smart ass, aren't you? So what if I am? Waitress, check, please. So now I beat you, what will you do about that? You did the right thing. I was wrong. I was wrong. I got beaten up! We saw it all. Then why didn't you step in? There were many reasons. If we were to fight it out here, it would have caused trouble for Jenny. Then I was beaten up in vain? Right. Big dummy... big dummy, I'm in big trouble. Don't call me big dummy. Call me Superman. Whatever, Superman. What is it? My school principal wants to see my parents. You have to pretend to be my parent. Be who? My father. You don't even have a father. You only have a brother. It doesn't matter. If my brother finds out the principal wants to see him, he would beat me to death. He would beat you up. Not me. Please help me out. I'll treat you to ice cream. I'm already eating ice cream, see? How about I give you my Superman toy? Superman plus ice cream, then. - Ok, ok. - Let's go. You can't see my principal dressed like this. What, then? I'll take you home to change. Do you remember what I told you to say? You said... Remember, if the principal asks you, just say... 'Don't you worry, I will teach the little brat. “If he doesn't listen, I'll kill him!” Now you repeat it. Don't you worry, I will teach the little brat... Who's the little brat? Me, of course! Now, make sure you don't forget. I'm counting on you. Principal, good morning. This is my father. Mr. pang, come on in. He didn't call me father. He called me Mr. pang. Mr. pang is my father. Go in! Have a seat. The purpose of our inviting you here today is to improve communications between the school and home. We all know that education in school and home, must complement each other. Pang kwok-wah is not making much progress in school. The homework he turns in is always wrong. I wondered... Does he have a home tutor? Don't you worry. I taught the little brat. If he doesn't listen, I'll kill him! That's a bit too severe. With kids, we just need to be a little firm. One more thing. He swears a lot. I wonder if, it could be bad influences from his friends or neighbors. Don't you worry. I taught the little brat. If he doesn't listen, I'll kill him! Another thing is, he likes to lie. There was one time when his classmate was missing a pencil sharpener. And we later found it in his school bag. His excuse was the pencil sharpener got into his school bag all by itself. On another occasion, he was over half an hour late. When I asked him why... He said he ran into a monster on the way. The excuses he used were rather strange. I wonder if it was influences from TV. Or if somebody taught him? Mr. pang? Oh, don't you worry. I taught the little brat. If he doesn't listen, I'll kill him! There's one last matter. A very serious one, I think I should let you know. A couple of days ago, when school let out. He molested a female classmate. What do you think of this matter? Don't you worry. I taught the little brat. If he doesn't listen, I'll kill him! Yesterday, he killed a classmate. Were you aware of it? I taught the brat. If he doesn't listen, I'll kill him! Mr. pang... Mr. pang... You may go now. Gong Kai-ming middle school hey, how'd it go? The principal asked me to leave. Then go ahead and leave. Pang kwok-wah. Come here. Big trouble. What do you think? Isn't it beautiful? The ship is so tall. “Tall” is not the right word to describe a ship. It should be “big.” But it is tall. Alright, the ship is both big and tall. You can't even take it all in with one look. How do you know if it's big or small? Whenever you can't see it all with one look, it must be big. Does that mean the sun is small then, since I can see it all? What does that mean? Smile means happy. No wonder people always smile when they see me. Guess they're all very happy. Your little brother is going to set sail pretty soon. What does that mean? That means I'll be working on board a ship. Can I go on board too? Not just yet. I'm starting at the very bottom now. Wait till I get promoted to be a captain, then I'll bring you on board. I want to be the navigator. Anything you want. But before I become a captain, there will be a period of time when I won't be seeing you. You'll have to take care of yourself. I'll take care of myself and you'll go shipping. Not go shipping. Go sailing. Yes, when you become the captain, then I'll be the navigator. Exactly. If you run into any problems, make sure you call me. This is my phone number on here. Grandma, I want one too. Lay off. The stuff isn't free, you know. $1.60 each. Here's $1.60. Oh, that's all right. We have to differentiate between personal relationship and business. Aunt seven, I'll count on you to take care of my brother's meals, then. Here's $1,800 to take care of meals for the first three months. You could've paid me afterwards. Why grandma, do you want to charge him interest too? Keep your nose out of my business, brat! My brother doesn't eat much. Just four bowls of rice a meal. He'll eat whatever you guys eat. Don't worry. You think I would treat him badly? What do you like to eat? I like to eat fatty pork. Fatty pork? That's extra work for me. You know, our whole family doesn't eat pork. I'll have to buy just for him. Grandma, didn't we have pork just last night? Brat, keep your little mouth shut! Don't listen to the kid. I'll give a $100 a month extra for pork, then. Here's $300. Oh, no need for such detailed calculations. Aunt seven, a chance to make a fast buck, eh? Keung, I'll slap your face! Hey, you still owe me for the last three beers. Open your eyes! Did you pawn your ancestors' shrine? I would have, if I could. Brother, I'll put some $5 coins in a jar. When you need money, you can take from there. But only one at a time. Aunt seven, thank you so much for your help. It's ok, don't worry. Sir, nice day to bring your brother out for a tan. He has such a bad mouth! Arrest him, Mr. fung! I don't have the right to arrest him now. Of course not. Is it illegal to have a bad mouth? - Brother, go and play with ming. - Let's go. It's so nice to be a kid. Not a worry in the world. I should have been brain dead as well. I could be happy go lucky as well. Mr. fung, how can you tolerate him? What comes around goes around. My little brother said, out at sea, the sky and the sea are the same color. Big dummy... Going sailing means he's dumping you. He won't. He's dumping you for sure. Why does he want to go sailing if he doesn't want to get rid of you? That's how my dad left my mom. Big dummy, go home and make a scene to prevent him from dumping you. Bad dummy! Peeping? Pervert! You're filthy! Big dummy, even girls bully you! How can your brother be so heartless and leave you? You didn't go to play with wah? Look at you. This place is a mess again. Next time make sure you put back the toys after playing with them. These are all five-dollar coins. Just open the lid and you can get them. You try it. What's the matter? I don't want you to dump me. Me, dump you? Silly. I wouldn't do that. You're going sailing. Means you're dumping me. Bobby's father did the same thing. Everyone says so. Don't listen to other people. I wouldn't leave you. You're lying to me! I'll let you watch me die! You want to dump me? I'll let you watch me die! - Don't! - Go away! - Don't! - Leave me alone! Are you crazy?! Crazy! Crazy, crazy, crazy! Dump you? If I could dump you, I would have dumped you 20 years ago! Would I need to wait till now? You think I'm happy? Always having to worry about you getting hungry, not wearing enough clothes, getting unhappy! Worry that you get picked on, looked down on, or that you may get lost! If not for you, I'd have seen the world, and not been stuck here in this place! Even now, you don't know how to take care of yourself! I'm human as well. I have dreams and ambitions, too. I can't sacrifice everything for you. I'm not so noble. I have thought about strangling you first and then committing suicide. Then both of us would have been better off. Can you do me a favor? Can you be a man? You're over thirty years old, do you know that? You're not a kid anymore. You're a grown-up! I'm not a little kid. I want to be a grown-up. I want to be a grown-up. In the words of a child I've said till the end of time I will hold your hand in mine never did I regret through laughter or tears never thought we'd go our separate paths This love, nurtured since we were small had led me to forget freedom yet it's fate, that we cannot battle side by side how do you mend a heart that's blind? How long can this last? Our love is like the ocean that never rests my heart aches when we're apart who can really stay together forever? Even if willing to give up the future I beg that you understand as years passed you have left your footprints on my mind humans rolling along and carried by the tides not able to stay around this love of ours stubbornly hangs on Excuse me, are you hiring? Looking for a job? Ask the boss. Yes? Are you hiring people here? What kind of experience do you have? Then what can you do? I can be Superman. Superman. So can you fly? Sure. Let's see, then. Here comes Superman... I'm flying! I've finished flying. Mui! What's up? How much change do you need? No, no, not that. I want you to see this. See what? Fat boy, let's see you fly one more time. Here comes Superman... I'm flying! Is he crazy? Not all the way, still got some manners and brain. I've finished flying. Great stuff. You did a good job. But we don't need Superman to work here. - What else can you do? - I will do anything! Do you know how to wait on tables? Wait on table? Sure. I'm waiting on the table. Fat boy, come back down. Where did you find this guy? I didn't, he came in here himself. Don't tease him anymore. How pitiful. You think he has a pride that can be hurt? Did I do a good job? Fat boy, this is not a good job for you. Working like a dog, it's very tiresome. See, it's not me. The lady boss worries that the work is too hard. You'd have to work like a bull. A bull? I can be a bull. Let me show you a bull. A bull... bull in the fields. Bulls work in the fields. I can do that. Fat boy! Let him try! Fat boy. Don't do it... don't do it! Did I do a bad job? Of course. Do you know how to be a hungry dog fighting for shit? When dogs are hungry, they'll fight to eat whatever they see. Now show me. Go ahead. - Fat boy, don't! - Let him. Fat boy, that was a pretty good dog. Now, how about an eel? An eel? Right! A white slippery eel. Crawling and sliding on the ground. So you'll hire me if I do a good job? Sure! Who else could I hire? He's really crazy. Not too bad at it either. Brother yan, it's you! What are you doing here? I'm interviewing for a job. I've almost got one. It's ok, you've done enough. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? If I was ashamed, I wouldn't have done it. I can do anything. What would you do if he were your son? If he were my son, I would've strangled him to death. Are you alright? - Why did you hit him...? - Shut up, otherwise you're next! Let's go. He said he's going to hire me. He will not hire you. How can you send your brother to look for work? Enough... enough! Enough? You think you can just cover your ears to this? Do you know how they made a fool of your brother? They made him act like a bull, a horse, a dog! And even as an eel, on the floor crawling! I know... I know... I know... Because you've told me a hundred times! How can you feel nothing? I feel nothing? You think I wanted any of this to happen? What would you do if he were your big brother? If he were my brother, I would protect him and love him. If he were my big brother... I would never have let anyone bully and pick on him. You two, please don't fight. I would never be heartless like you. How can you pretend not to see, not to hear when your brother gets abused like this? Are you even human? I don't want to argue with you anymore! So I can't see, I can't hear. So what?! I'm ashamed to call myself your friend! I'm leaving! Little brother, please don't cry. Brother, don't be mad at me. I won't. It was all my fault. Kick it over here. Thanks. Little brother. What's wrong? You're not having fun? You said to go on a trip. Been here an hour, just watching you and your brother play soccer. How can I be having fun? - Let's kiss and make up. - He's coming. Go play soccer. Here. What's that... a consolation prize? Your brother is back again. How far can you kick the ball? Watch me. Here. Now there's enough time for us to do anything. Have you lost your mind? In broad daylight... I hope the ball went over the hill. I do too. Brother! Mr. Kim, how about a 20% discount from the price you quoted me? 20% discount? What do you take me for? Mr. Kim. Take it easy. We're both businessmen. A little bargaining is commonplace. If 20% is too much, how about a 15% discount, then? You're a businessman. I'm a thief. My men risked their lives to get the goods. They did not get a bargain then, yet you want me to bargain when selling? That would make me lose face. Cops. The goods! Boss, don't worry. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't move. What's going on? Why are you here? I have reasons to believe that the goods stolen in the queen's jewelry robbery last week, are here. - Inspector wong. - Yes? Someone escaped through the back of the hill. Take some men to the back to search. Who was that at the back of the hill? You're funny. How should I know? Who it was picnicking at the peak, too? Inspector wong, out back is a steep slope. He escaped. Excuse us, Mr. Kim. Would you check if anything is stolen? No need. If anything, consider it my gifts to your men. Stand down. Stand down. - Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. - What's the matter? There are many sinners in this world. What more do you want? I've already died on the cross for you! Can you die one more time? I can't. Are there no more cops left in the world? They're all on vacation. All right. I'll send you the assassin, to earth, to destroy all sinners. Heading to earth. Charge! Oh, no. Jesus has sent the assassin to come after us. - Run! - Run! Don't move! You can't get away this time. Are you all right? It really hurts! Oh, you robbed someone! No, I didn't, it wasn't me. It wasn't me either. But you scared him with your gun. I wasn't even playing with him. But he didn't know that. Now you're a robber. Him too. He was playing too. Wonder what's in the bag? If my brother finds out I robbed someone, I'll get a scolding. He won't know if you don't tell him. Then let's go. Let's go. Go? What about the bag? How about if we hide the bag and promise not to tell? Hide it where? You just pick it up and follow us. Now don't anyone tell about this. What if one of us does? I don't know. Let's swear to it. Should I, leung chi-man, tell anyone about this, my dad will drop dead. Your turn now. If I tell anyone, my dad will drop dead. Your dad died a long time ago. Then who should drop dead? Swear on the life of your little brother. I don't want my little brother to die. I don't want my dad to die either. If you don't tell, he won't die. Now, swear! If 1 tell anyone about this, my little brother will drop dead. If I tell anyone, my big brother will drop dead. Let's go. I'm afraid you'll be recognized. Yeah, you'd better stay home for a while. Hello? Hold on. Boss, it's fat. - Yes? - Boss. It's me. Are you all right? I'm fine, but the cops have got the goods. What? The cops got the stuff? Yeah. What should I do now? That's all right. They're not worth that much anyway. Don't come back here yet. Wait for me at the oasis restaurant. Ok. I'll wait for you there. Fat is playing games. He wants to swallow the goods. - Take care of him. - Yes. - Sorry. - Don't worry. What are you doing? Hey, give me back my car! Who is it? - You're tsou chi-fa? - Yes. I was the one who called. Can you tell us your motive and request? I volunteer to be a police witness in prosecuting Kim. In exchange, I would like to have police protection. The police don't protect just anyone. What do you have on him? I've been with him for over ten years. I have proof of his many crimes. Plus the goods the police confiscated this morning. Regarding the goods you mentioned on the phone, I've already checked. The police do not have it. Officer, are you kidding me? It was your man who took my bag at gunpoint! Mr. tsou, how can you be sure that he was a cop? Or you decided to keep the goods yourself? Keep them myself? Officer, you think I've lost my head? You know Kim well. If I've taken the goods, he'll make sure I will not live to enjoy them. So you lost the goods. And you're scared that he'll kill you. You're quite a bastard. An eye for an eye! Even without the goods, I can still get him! Let's go and arrest him now! I'm the one calling the shots here. Fung, you continue to keep an eye on Kim. I'll assign someone else to this case. Two of you stay here to watch him. Without my order, he is not to leave with anyone. Stop there. We're c.1.D. What's up, officer? Against the wall! Sir, what did I do? Nothing. I just don't like the way you look. I have a few questions for you. Do I have to answer them? You don't have to. Have you seen this person? Look carefully. Well? - Have you seen him? - No. Let's go. Brother. What's big dummy up to these days? I don't know. Don't know? Then why are the cops looking for him? Hey! He's acting peculiar. Open the door! Big dummy! Open the door! What's happening, wah? What are you looking for? Where is your brother? Why? There are cops looking for you? What for? Because you've robbed someone. I didn't Rob anyone! What do I do now? Let's take that bag to the police. Ok. Let's go, then. Hurry up. What do you think's inside the bag? Don't know. Let's take a look. Look at all this jewelry. Put it back, let's go. Big dummy! Big dummy! Fat boy is now being brought up. Looks like he'll be fine. That's the fat guy! You sure? I haven't heard of any jewelry store robbery lately. Don't blame me if you're slow. All right. I'll take $10,000 for each one. But you have to take them all off my hands. For that, I have to inspect the goods first. When I see the money. You think I'd walk around with all that jewelry? Not bad! Just like that, you've turned into a millionaire. That's fate and some luck. You certainly are lucky. The money is here. What's the matter? What's the matter, big brother? How did you get the goods? What goods? I'll talk! I found them. You found them? Where's the rest of them? At my house. It hurts. Now you know. How did you fall off the hill? I was pushed. Pushed? Who pushed you? A man in a mask. Man in a mask? Yes. He was incredible. He just gave me a kick and I fell off the hill. Don't go there to play anymore. I didn't go there to play. I went to pick up something. Pick up something? What? Pick... pick... I can't tell you. If I tell, you will die. I've sworn to it. I won't die. Just tell me. Come on in. Come in. Have a seat everyone. Why is everyone standing? You are under arrest in connection with the robbery at queen's jewelry. What? You have the right to remain silent. Cuff him. Wait, sir. My brother just got out from quite a scare. I'll bring him to the station tomorrow. Nonsense. This is an official arrest. You should know better than to interfere with this. My brother is mentally retarded. Mentally retarded? So he could Rob people at gunpoint? Sir, can you tell me what this is all about? Men, take him in. Sir, can you let me take him into the station? Don't take me away. Don't move! Don't do that. It'll scare my brother! Don't, please! No! Brother! - Sir, we don't see him. - Sir, we lost him. - Nothing, sir. - No. Do you know by your actions today, I can bring on four charges against you? Now, don't ever say I didn't give you a chance. I think you can find your brother. I hope you bring him to see me tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Let's go. Could he be at wah's house? - Go on! What are you looking at? - Move it! Why would keung be with those guys? The cops are after you? Did you say anything about me? No. I didn't say anything. You can... hide here for a little while. But when my brother comes back... My brother's back! Just hide in there. Remember, don't make a sound. Big brother... he has nothing to do with it. Leave him alone. Cut the bullshit. Where are the goods? In the closet. Just go and get it! - Go on. - Hurry up! Who's this? He's my brother's friend, but he's retarded. Take the stuff out. Brother! Don't move! Little brother. Don't touch him! Don't come any closer! - Boss. - Boss. Boss. We've found the goods. It really wasn't fat after all. But informants tell me he's planning to be a police witness. He wants to sell me out. Boss, let me take care of him. Take care? How? They've got him under police protection. Get up. Are you taking me to dinner? Yes, to dinner. Who the hell is this? He is the brother of a cop, but he's retarded. Where can we find your brother? I don't know. He's usually the one who finds me. What's that? Neck. Hello? ...Speaking. How's my brother? I'm warning you not to mess with my brother! Your brother is safe for now. Come, it's your little brother. Speak to him. Little brother, come and pick me up soon. That's enough, eat your apple. Listen up. I want to see fat tomorrow or your brother is a dead man. What should I do now? This is over our heads. We better go by the book. No. If we go by the book, there's no way inspector wong will let fat go in exchange for my brother. He's more concerned about arresting Kim than saving my brother's life. But... But for us... But... You don't need to say anything. Are we friends? Why didn't I tell anyone but the four of you? Yes, why? Why? You're still asking why? My brother is in such great danger, and you're asking me why? All right, all right. Sorry, we're friends. What do you want us to do? I want you to help me get fat out to exchange for my brother. What happens after that? We'll get Kim and all those bastards. - That's no piece of cake! - That's why I'm asking for your help. When, then? Right now. Hey, it's fung. Take a seat. I have to take him in. Are you kidding? What for? I can't tell you, but I must take him. No one can leave with him without inspector wong's orders. Lok and yan, let them see the order. We have reports that someone is trying to abduct the police witness. Immediately block off the hotel and bring the witness to police hq. What happened? - The commander is here. - For drinks? No. He's brought a whole squad. How'd he find out so fast? That's big trouble for us. Let's give up! Give up! What about my brother? With the commander personally taking charge, it won't be easy! Wouldn't care even if he was a general with a dragon head. You guys stay here. I'll create a diversion. Meet me at shatin. Stop him! You guys go on ahead. Be careful. We'll take care of ourselves. I'm talking about my brother. Yan and lok, let's split up and help fung out. Let's do it. Where's my brother?! Your brother is right here. He'll be fine. You let my brother go now! Where's my big brother? Speak! In the basement office. Don't move! Hurry! Over there... over there! Don't try to stop me! This is my occupation! Good thing I got back here in time. You all have to die either way. Go to die! Move in. - Follow us. - Yes, sir. When you get out, maybe you can work for me again. How come you didn't even let me in? And it's a good thing you didn't. - You're in trouble this time. - I really didn't know anything. Quickly. In the words of a child I've said till the end of time I will hold your hand in mine never did I regret through laughter or tears never thought we'd go our separate paths This love, nurtured since we were small had led me to forget freedom yet it's fate, that we cannot battle side by side how do you mend a heart that's blind? How long can this last? Our love is like the ocean that never rests my heart aches when we're apart who can really stay together forever? Even if willing to give up the future I beg that you understand as years passed you have left your footprints on my mind humans rolling along and carried by the tides not able to stay around this love of ours stubbornly hangs on This love, nurtured since we were small had led me to forget freedom yet it's fate, that we cannot battle side by side how do you mend a heart that's blind? How long can this last? Our love is like the ocean that never rests my heart aches when we're apart who can really stay together forever? Even if willing to give up the future Our love is like the ocean that never rests my heart aches when we're apart who can really stay together forever? Even if willing to give up the future look ahead and let go of the sadness come to see there is no need to seek whether we'll always be together for when we are apart I can always feel your heart close to mine
