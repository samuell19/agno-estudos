BASED ON REAL EVENTS 8:20. You have no idea how we got here, right? There's a large lake with a small island on it. In the middle of nowhere. Even most of the locals don't know it exists. There's a small hut. I built it with my father a long time ago. We dreamed about hiding there from the world. How we'd make a garden where we would plant tomatoes, fish and swim. We'd live in nature for weeks. We would even build a pier, and we'd jump into the Tisza. This was our dream. But we couldn't finish it. My father passed away. And I never went back to the island. But one day the world seemed to have changed. And I felt some sort of an urge to go back to the island. So I packed up and set off. Last time I saw the hut was seven years ago. Its exterior was fatigued, worn by time, but there was still something special about it… As I entered, I felt that this place had been waiting for me for a long time. The old memories of how much we planned and dreamed… We even brought the little angel to look after the hut. It seems like it was yesterday… Everything remained as we left it, and everything you would ever need was here, far from civilization. My dad insisted we build a secret storage room to hide the supplies. I couldn't remember what he had left in it… It was a real pantry. Canned food, oil, rice, buckwheat, enough for months, as if he was prepared for war… And there were boots, coats, lamps, seeds, champagne, pálinka, and all sorts of bits and bobs, including my favorite mug. I brought a few mundane devices. If I was bored, I would learn to take photos or record my thoughts. My father had a small box where he stored his carefully guarded things. I was curious what was in there, but I wasn't ready for it yet. I brought plenty of food with me. There was also a fishing rod and plenty of fish in the water. I was sure I wouldn't starve. Not that I would stay for that long. As the sun rose, it looked as if it wanted to bathe in the river Tisza. Every morning I rowed a few kilometers. It was quiet. There was no one, not a soul in the area. It's like I own the whole lake. While I was feeling okay, the world was filled with fear. And I didn't want to be afraid. I wanted to forget everything for a while, to break away from the treadmill. So I moved away from that world with every stroke of the paddle. Good morning, Lake Tisza! I said at work that I went into voluntary quarantine and then I would check in online. They even praised me for being a responsible person. But of course I didn't tell where I was. I felt like it was a good decision to come here. The number of coronavirus cases has risen above 100. Eighteen more people, sixteen Hungarians and two foreigners have tested positive, so authorities have already confirmed 103 official cases. So far, four people have died from complications… Those were carefree days. I did whatever I wanted to. I didn't have to report to anyone. I had a great time. Then one day it became freezing cold. Cloudiness will increase at night, and mostly overcast can be expected during the day. At dawn, snow and flurries are likely mainly in the Great Plains and South Transdanubia and in few places in the north. In some areas, there may be sleet or rain. The north wind will get stronger, becoming stormy in many directions. At dawn, the temperature is expected to be between -2 and -7 degrees Celsius. However, it can be colder in clear, windless areas. Good morning, Lake Tisza! I was trapped in the hut that protected me with the warmth of the small stove. I felt safe. As the storm passed, I took my father's coat and ventured out. It's like I'm walking in another world. Everything was frozen in ice. The endless silence captivated me. I was just walking for days. Far in the middle of the lake, the birds gathered in a huge iceless spot. They were all there to survive and feed. The cold broke me, taught me humility. Winter disappeared just as quickly as it came. I felt like I was given a new chance by the island. Until then I was just hanging mid-air. But the sudden winter made me realize that I was unprepared. I decided to create a daily schedule that would help me to bring order to my life so that my days didn't fall apart. I found an abandoned dam keeper's house in the area that had electricity so I could charge the batteries. That was my only luxury on the island. The greatest human achievement in the world. There's electricity! All my days started and ended the same. Preparing for the next day. The first infections were confirmed a month ago. Since then 678 people have been infected, 32 have died and 58 have recovered. The epidemic in Italy is currently the most serious in the world. The coronavirus claimed a total of 5,476 victims. I started to get used to having to live with the ever-changing weather. After the cold winter, the stormy wind that lasted for two weeks was perhaps more unpleasant. It trapped me in the drafty hut again. The sound of howling wind and waves brought me gloomy days. On the radio there was only bad news. The world was getting more and more terrified. Pope Francis has initiated that people join together in saying the Lord's Prayer on Wednesday at noon. JOINT PRAYER WITH THE POPE I asked God to watch over my family and friends and show me why he brought me here. Before I went to the island, I had gone to the Father. There were no more masses, they were banned because of the virus. It was just the two of us. He was wearing purple, the color of repentance. I saw that he was afraid. He was clinging to God. He always gave wise words and supported the community, despite the dwindling number of churchgoers. In our comfortable lives we forget God, but when there is a problem, we hastily turn to Him… I told him that I was going to the island, I was hiding away. I didn't want to meet and talk to anyone. I wanted to face my fears and myself. I asked him to come for me when this madness is over. But he shouldn't look for me and I wouldn't seek him either. As the island had accepted me, I decided to do something for it in return. I would cleanse it of the human filth that had ruined it. I found you on the first of April. Maybe once someone loved you very much but lost you. So I adopted you, a plush frog on April Fools' Day. My father left a bunch of seeds in the storage. I realized that I could get some delicate soil from molehills. And the collected garbage will function as a pot. So I planted all the seeds: tomatoes, peppers, kohlrabi and lots and lots of flowers. Most of us are too conscious of what others think of our deeds. We live according to others' expectations. We are afraid to be ourselves. But on the island I learned that I only have to live up to myself. Nature was my gym, I trained every day with whatever I found. I decided to practice handstands until I could stand still for a minute. So I climbed and lifted everything. And I swam every day, not minding the weather. I strengthened not only my body, but also my will. I had been living on the island for six weeks. During this time, the environment around me and my life changed completely. When I arrived here, everything seemed so gray. Then the island turned green before my eyes. I could watch each and every sprout. Beautiful flowers appeared out of nowhere and the first inhabitants appeared. The island was full of life, and I also made new friends. I had no idea where they came from. They were quite small. I never had time to observe them like this before. They were all around me, I was not alone. Every morning the sun moved a little to the left on the horizon. On April 12th, it rose right in front of my hut. As if it just wanted to come see me… Though it was my hut that faced the sun. We would like to believe that the world revolves around us, but we are just tiny specks of dust in it. Easter was coming. The angel statue with the broken wing was already over 100 years old. A family heritage. One feels that the objects held by one's ancestors have some special, inexplicable power. We instinctively respect them. Who knows how many people prayed to her. Now she was watching over me. Happy Easter to you! Easter eggs, yellow and blue Easter eggs for me and you Easter eggs, candy, sweet Easter eggs are good to eat I chose loneliness myself, but I didn't want to back down. Something changed in me. Whenever I went out to the Tisza, I felt that she soothed and healed my soul. It's like she can sense what I need. I've always been afraid of loneliness, but I've never admitted it to myself. I always needed someone by my side. Someone I can talk to, someone I can touch. My psychologist said I am co-dependent. In the hut, my mind kept wandering about the past. My father said not to dwell on it, to look forward, to wake up. Life's too short to ruminate. At Easter I set out to visit an island where there is an enchanted small lake with black water. My father told me when I was a child that a big bear guards the entrance, and you can get in through its fur. You have to go when he is asleep, quietly, not to wake him up. The lake was full of life. But only those saw it who'd arrive with an open soul. I was surrounded by bustling birds, croaking frogs and fish spawning in the reeds. The water was almost boiling, but still so calm. Happy Easter! It was a modest dinner, but I think it was one of the most beautiful dinners of my life. My father always offered wise counsel. He always gave his opinion on everything. It seemed like he just wanted to interfere in my life and he didn't really care about my feelings. He just spoke his mind. I never listened to him. But in most cases he knew exactly what I needed better than I did. He just wanted me to be happy. I received a package the next day. My mother sent it. It had a lot of useful things, supplies and tools and she also packed home-made delicacies, made by her. I had craved them so much. Getting so much from her inspired me. I wanted to make changes. Now that nature had renewed itself around me, I thought I would also beautify my little home. There were a lot of slats under the hut. I also collected what I found in the area. I gave new life to all the old boards and started to implement my plans. I made shelves, tables and all kinds of useful storage devices. Thus, everything had its worthy place. Even my father's guitar. My mother once said that if one wants to free themselves, they should sing, even if they cannot. I took her advice. I saved you. Wanna be friends? Yesterday another 99 Hungarian citizens were diagnosed with the coronavirus infection bringing the total number of confirmed cases to almost 2,400. Eleven elderly chronic patients have died, adding up to a total of 240 deaths… How much longer is this going to take? Perhaps the virus did not come to destroy, but to teach… CLEAN YARD, NEAT HOUSE The inside of the hut improved greatly, now I want to beautify the outside. Also to fix the roof and paint it nicely, since my mother sent a lot of paint. Planting flowers, putting lanterns on top, to make it homely. God created man so that we, too, could create. Anyone. Just as animals build nests, we instinctively want to create our homes. What do you think? Dark! It's too dark. Because it's dark. It's almost nighttime. It might be a little dark, but it will fade. I might not make a handrail. I will definitely put a barrier there to the left. But otherwise, we have to make the anchor, we have to paint the name of the hut. "We"? Actually, I do everything by myself. You were just watching from the inside, giving me orders. At night I was already working on my next plan. A much bigger bite than the previous ones. Father… I didn't want to go home yet. Absolutely not. After I renovated the hut, I was full of new plans. That's it! It can't be done like this… My father's old boat was 20 kilometers from the island. Maybe my plan will succeed with that. I secured the boat about ten meters from the shore, and I finally managed to start work. All day I was hammering the three-meter piles into the one-eighty-meter water. One after another. This is terribly tiring, hard physical work. Then I started screwing with the drill my mother sent to make my life easier. By the evening I was ready with the bases. However, the next day was stormy. I couldn't do anything but watch and hope that my structure could withstand the big waves. Until I could work on the water, I kept myself busy on the island. For days I just cut the grass, then I started building the fence. Then I continued the pier by preparing the lead-in bridge. I had to knock down more piles and build a pillar out of stones. I temporarily threw some pallets on it, so in the morning I could already have coffee on my pier, satisfied. I received another package from my mother, she sent a lot of flowers and soil. With this, I got closer and closer to implementing the plans. My seedlings also grew in the meantime, so I planted them as well. I had to move about two tons of stone to build a more stable foundation for the first pillar. The weather didn't bother me anymore, I worked in rain and storm. I wanted a solid and durable structure, which turned out to be exactly ten meters long. With that, my pier was finally finished. All that's left to do is painting it. It was so stable that it could have supported ten people. But I was the only one on it. I'd been on the island for three months when the smell of summer flowers hit me in the distance. It was time to move out. Miracles surround us, we just walk past them. But now I had time to experience and admire everything. I had never seen the beginning of summer so beautiful. My pier brought me a lot of joy and made washing easier. I had never enjoyed pure existence like this. So I decided that I will stay for the whole summer and ignore the world. I continued to build my pier the best I could. I sanded and painted the old boards nicely. I painted almost every part in a different color, as I didn't have two identical boxes, but I think it made it prettier. After a month, I created a cool construction. I was very proud of myself. Done. While I was building the pier, the same bird appeared again and again. A greater white-fronted goose. She came closer and closer to find food on the island. I gave her some corn, which she shyly accepted. She was weakened and her wing appeared to be injured. She was so exhausted that she fell asleep after she was full. Then she swam away. WELCOME The next day she appeared again, remembering that she could get food here. She seemed to trust me, she didn't mind my proximity. And I continued to paint the pier and the boards as if nothing had happened. She stayed until dusk every day. Then she always swam away, far away towards another island. I was occupied with painting the boards. I thought she's not coming back anyway. But I was wrong. She returned every day. So I was thinking about naming her. But the island didn't have a name either. This place gave me hope and happiness, so I named it the Island of Good Hope. And my precious little bird had brown eyes as beautiful as a woman's, so I named her Márti and called her that every day when she appeared. I will have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Eight peppers. What a fierce fighter you are! Márti always watched what I was doing and came closer and closer. She felt safe with me. I looked after her, I took care of her. But I left her free, I accepted her as she was. I didn't want to tame her, since she was free like a bird, I can't own her. A gift in my life. I think she made me understand how the female soul works. That's how the place where I lived became Good Hope Island. Now I could watch the sunrise from the pier I built with my own hands. And also how Márti came back to me every morning. I think she fell for me. She cheered for me as I was building the pier, and she was happy with me when I inaugurated my work. She was a true companion. PIER OF GOOD HOPE Finally! In a month and a half, I completed the pier, which I named the Pier of Good Hope. With this, I made come true the dream my father and I had. I spared all the spiders in the hut and let the frogs in too. They were my protectors against mosquitoes, so life went on at night in the hut and in the water. Márti decided to leave me one morning. She spotted a family of swans. She followed the little ones, wanted to join. But the parents were not happy about it. They chased her away. She returned disappointed. But she didn't give up. She tried for days. In vain. She soon learned that she shouldn't go where she's not wanted. So after a week she didn't even care about them. She stayed with me. But of course she disappeared every night. At night the island was full of foxes. They were Márti's enemies, and she knew that I couldn't protect her while I was asleep. Hence she left every night. I had enemies, too. They always came at night. They were very ugly and were craving my tomatoes, as well as carving them. Every night I collected the snails and took them to the other end of the island. Just try and come back from there! Of course they solved it somehow. By the end of June, I ran out of canned food, so I started fishing. Most of the time, of course, Márti ate the bait corn. Or if it wasn't Márti, then it was another sharp-eyed thief on the island. Then I finally caught the first bream, which I immediately fried. Whenever I needed food, the Tisza provided. As if she knew I needed to eat. She was generous with me. She gave me fish, I drank her water, cooked and watered the vegetables with it. I got everything I needed from nature. The river showed her rare face beyond the dams. She was out of the river bed. Yellow water flooded the fields and the surrounding forests. The Tisza was flooding, but she was not angry. The water took me gently as I avoided the eddies. The river carried me straight into the forest, it wanted to show me something. I paddled among the leaves of the trees like I was in a fairy tale. Everything was under water. When I was a child, there was a small cinema on the edge of the village. It was my little window to the world. I spent most of my time at the cinema or on the river. These were the two places that fueled my dreams. There were times when I sat completely alone in the room and everything around me disappeared. I was 11 years old when an Italian film changed something in me. I believed that movies can make people and their thinking better. They help us find the beautiful things in life, understand love, the meaning of life, and get to know ourselves. Time flies and dreams are forgotten or we say it's too late. By now, nothing has remained of the small cinema, only dust and ruins… What would I say to the child if I met him today? What happened to his dreams? It was an abundant month, the fruits ripened in the area. I didn't need money because I got everything for free from nature. And I didn't need new things either because when something broke I would fix it. This way it meant more to me and I was prouder of myself. Well, that's how my humble days passed. Actually it was a life of luxury. I lived on the waterfront on my own little property with a huge pool in front. I could eat fresh fish and organic vegetables every day, and in the evenings I could have dinner in a restaurant with a view in the company of a charming woman at the best table. Good evening, Lake Tisza! Bon appétit! I once asked my father what real freedom is like. He said: "Freedom? Do you know what can give someone freedom?" "The will. A man's own will." "That gives power that is stronger than freedom." "Know how to want and you will be free." "And the world opens up to you." By mid-summer, the bear's fur had turned into a green carpet. And I became a modern man living in the wilderness. I had breakfast in a new place almost every day. I wasn't in a hurry, I never had to worry about anything. Well, actually, I was a little worried about Márti, especially since I ran out of canned corn. But I found a solution. And she was always grateful and put a smile on my face. When her belly was full, she really slept like a human. Like a woman. For weeks I just roamed the lake with my canoe. I visited the places my father took me when I was a child. I always spent the nights elsewhere. Sometimes I slept in a tent, sometimes in the open air in the canoe. Some inexplicable calmness and harmony came over me. I used to think that happiness is a momentary feeling that never lasts long. We can always feel it by the influence of others. My father once said that we cannot be happy with someone else until we experience happiness in ourselves. I asked: "But man is a social being. Why should we be happy alone?" "If we are able to experience this alone, then we will be able to share it." "With the one we love. It's a question of maturity, son." "Otherwise, we will always expect happiness from someone else." "We have to learn to enjoy our own company and what surrounds us." "And we can learn this mostly in nature." And if we're lucky, our Mother sends us a cake for our birthday wherever we are. Happy birthday! Out on the water, time stopped. I was in another space and another world. I never saw her face… I always woke up. Maybe the dream reflected my desires or the future. To trust someone even with your eyes closed. I had to paddle 20 kilometers to visit the place my father called the Sanctuary. He was told by a wise man that souls sometimes return to earth to help those they loved on their journey. They see us through the eyes of animals. When an animal looks at us, maybe a soul is guarding us. We may also call them angels. This Sanctuary is where we can meet them. The cormorants always arrived at six o'clock, and there were a lot of them. They flew close to the water and chose a spot where they fished in unison. They are smart and clever creatures, and they only prey on what they really need. They are not greedy like humans. The fewer things someone owns, the more they appreciate them. I only had two spoons, so I watched them like a hawk. Once one of them disappeared, I searched for it for days. But in the city I wouldn't have cared, because there are ten more. The problem with the world today is that we believe worthless things to be valuable and valuable things to be worthless. It doesn't matter if we lose them, because we can replace everything and everyone. There is always better, more beautiful… I made a good deal with the only fisherman in the area. So I always had bacon, eggs and bread in my hut. Sometimes even simple things can make you happy. They say the river has a soul and can mediate between the earthly and the afterlife. To connect souls, wherever they may be. The smell and tranquility of the Tisza always brings back my childhood memories… I was ten when we were on the way home from one of our fishing trips, which always made Dad happy. He was able to fish all night long and catch fish. But that day we didn't even have a bite, so he was pretty upset. He was always smoking by half-rolled-down car windows, listening to blaring music. Most of the time it was Boney M or Neoton. I loved being with him, I was never afraid in his company, and I would have followed him anywhere just to be together. He always drove fast so that my mom wouldn't scold us for being late. But that evening we could hardly see the road in the thick fog. He hit something. But we didn't see what. He told me to stay in the car, he'd be right back. He was holding a deer. He said it had died and now we would take it with us to the hunter as we couldn't leave it on the road. I had never seen such a beautiful animal. I didn't understand what it meant to be dead. My father felt guilty. He said if we hadn't hurried like this, it wouldn't have happened. But we can't turn back time. My father said death doesn't hurt and everyone dies someday. This was the fate of the deer. We couldn't have saved it. His body was still warm. I put my hand on his heart and wished it would beat again. I was sure I could save him. It was like he was just sleeping. But his eyes became glassy, his body became cold. Death took the deer, I couldn't save him. I put my hand on his heart and wished it would beat again. I was sure I could save him. It was like he was just sleeping. But his eyes became glassy, his body became cold. Death took my father. I couldn't save him. Sunflower was his favorite flower. When I arrived on the island I had only one measurable goal. One minute. And for those 60 seconds I had to practice for half a year, every day. Persistence was the key to reaching the goal. A resilient mind strengthens the body and a resilient body strengthens the mind. Yes! A lot of tomatoes grew, so I pickled them according to my mother's recipe. Both the green ones and the ripe ones. I'd never done this before. But since I decided to stay until autumn, I had to prepare. I still had a lot of plans. I will build a light tower next to the hut. Maybe I'm out of my mind. It will have a reading room, a pantry, a bathroom and a shed for Márti. So we can even stay for the winter. I was on my way home from paddling when I noticed someone was on my island. I quickly took out my binoculars and to my surprise I saw a familiar face. The Father was standing on my pier. Father! Come on! Hurry up! I was so happy to see him, I couldn't believe my eyes. I last saw him more than six months ago and now he was here, he came to me. Welcome to the Island of Good Hope! Praise be Jesus Christ! Now and forever. Amen. -How did you get here? -Your mom showed me the place on a map. -But it's a secret. -There are no secrets from priests… Of course! Come on, I'll show you my empire. -Aren't you too hot in this reverend? -Hot as hell! Wanna swim later? That's a great idea! -Have you brought swim trunks? -I have. I wanted to show him everything on my little property. I knew he loved tomatoes, so first I boasted about them. He ate about half a kilo, but there were plenty, I was happy to share. Tasty? Then we exchanged ideas about flower care and finally splashed in the cooling Tisza. We jumped like children. He had never canoed before, so I taught him to paddle, with more or less success. And he showed me his fishing skills… and he caught a carp for me within ten minutes. Márti also appeared, who would convert any time for a little corn. Where's that from? I found it. You found it… -You found it. -I stole it. That's more believable. I showed him my hut, where no one had ever stepped before except for my dad. He could see my carefully kept secrets and how simply I had been living here for months. It turned out that we read similar books and that the Father can play the guitar very well. The hundred-year-old angel. -Did she watch over you? -Yeah. I told him about my plans, how I made them and what difficulties I encountered. And I also introduced him to Breki. He smiles like you! Later on, the Father got a little weird, so before he left, I offered him a cup of tea and thought I'd ask a few questions. And what's up in the city? Haven't you heard the news? No, I don't really care about it here. But my mother said that the lockdown is over. Right? Not only the restrictions are over, but the whole virus threat. We are finally free! You can go home. But I can come back here anytime. Father, could you bless my hut? My dad would love it too. You can do it any time… It's too late. They sold the island. A hotel will be built here. Everything you've built must be torn down. That can't be. This is my island and my hut. Not yours. You and your father built it illegally. Everything has to be torn down? Everything? You don't have to watch it. They'll pack up and deliver everything to you. Why does God take away from me what I built with my own hands? Why does God take away from me what makes me happy? God has not taken anything from you, God always gives. He gave you half a year to experience real freedom. You could be out here in nature, you got to know yourself, you became stronger. He showed you that you can be happy without having anything. No money, no nothing. You were afraid of loneliness, you were afraid to come here. But you overcame it, because the Lord gave you strength. Praise the Lord for you were able to experience this. I am grateful, of course, grateful. Let go of the hut. Let go of your father. How much time do you need to pack your things? Did you come to take me? Yes, I did. Back to the treadmill? Back to your real life. Give me one more day, so I can say goodbye to the island. I'll be back tomorrow. Thank you. As soon as the Father left, I became aware that it was all over. The dream that I had built up as a result of my memories, the imaginary world in which my father was with me all the time. Everything he taught me, everything we dreamed about, everything that I believed, the hut itself was my father. I didn't want to face reality, so life forced me to. It felt like a piece of my heart had been ripped out. I only trusted in the Tisza, and that she would heal me. Hi, good evening, sweetie. Weren't you sleeping? Not yet. How are you, darling? I'm going home tomorrow. Oh well, finally! Did the Father visit you? Yes, he did. Yes. And what did he say? I'll tell you later. All right, then we'll meet tomorrow and discuss everything. I'll call you when I arrive. -Good night! -Good night! Bye. My dear Son, when you find this letter, I will certainly no longer be with you. I'm sorry that we couldn't complete our dream together, but sometimes God has other plans. As soon as you entered the hut again, our shared dreams came back to life and I know you will make them come true. You may be here for a long time, weeks, maybe even months. It will not be easy. But this is where you will find yourself, this is where your soul will blossom. Maybe you will even build the pier and it will be the bridge between you and me, and the hut is the place where you can find love. If you ever have children, make sure to bring them here and tell them the things I taught you, that my father told me and your great-grandfather told him. Please forgive me for the words and actions I hurt you with. One day, maybe even now, you'll know that it was all because I wanted you to be happy and to live a fuller life than I did. Don't make the same mistakes, but do experience all the beauty and goodness that I did. No father is happier than the one seeing his son happy! Live long, happily, in love and laugh a lot! Take care of your mother, without whom I would not have been the man I was, and be a good sibling to your brother, who is also part me. I love you! Your father. This lovely little bird has become very dear to me. She has given me a lot. I wanted to take her with me, but that would have been selfish of me, and I'd have deprived her of her freedom. Márti was happy here, even with a broken wing. This is her home. I don't need to save her and I can't do it anyway. Our journey together ends here. I have to let her go. Goodbye, Dad. See you on the Tisza! You've been drinking? Can you tell? -Father, this car's going to fall apart! -No! I'll go to the heaven in this. -Do you think they will let you in? -For sure! They see how poor I am! God bless you! -Have a safe trip. -Thank you for everything! That's how we got here. The train is leaving platform 13. Please stand back from the platform edge. The train number S80 to Hatvan is scheduled to depart from platform five in three minutes. Please board the train. Attention, the doors are closing automatically. BUDAPEST KELETI STATION The next stop is Rákóczi Square. READER PASS If I told her name and library pass number, could you give me her phone number so that I can meet her personally?

We're going to move on to the second segment. Welcome to the treadmill where we have everything! Man created machines that serve us, do everything for us, and for money we can get anything instantly. Yet we don't have time for anything. Technology takes it away from us and we don't even notice it. We experience the world through gadgets and screens. We don't talk, we close ourselves off and communicate via chat, respond with emojis, so we slowly forget to speak and write correctly. We rely on the opinions of others, we think less and less because we get everything ready-made. We are motivated to buy newer and newer things and own expensive objects that make us think that we are happy and successful. This is dictated by every advertisement. We believe it and deceive ourselves. This is how time flies by, till one day we wake up to a great void that something is missing from our lives. Life itself. I was in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, home to 1.5 million people. Yet I felt much lonelier than I'd ever felt on the island. But the island taught me that loneliness is just a state that creates an opportunity to evolve my soul and interpret the world around me. Good night. Talk to you tomorrow. People come and go in our lives. Only few of them stay with us. We cross each other's paths, sometimes we travel together for a long time, sometimes we only get a short episode. But each encounter adds something to our lives. Guess what! I met a girl. What? Really? -A beautiful girl. -Wow, where? On the subway. When I came back to Budapest, right then. She was sitting opposite me on the subway and… And she left her book there, guess what, a Chekhov piece. The same I'm reading. Oh, great! And I found it, put it away and inside it was her reader pass and from that I found out her name and checked her on Facebook. I DM-ed her, but she hasn't replied yet. Father, I want to ask you something. Go ahead! Since I came back to the city, I keep thinking about why you said that the virus threat was over, when you probably knew it wasn't over yet. I was glad you were there. But I was worried about you. I felt that you had gone overboard, I was afraid you wouldn't find your way back to the community and you wouldn't find what you're looking for, what you want. Okay, but… The island indeed was sold, but I needed another reason to move you out of there. That's why I lied. Please forgive me. So you teamed up with my mother… It's been 70 days since I returned to the city, 70 days since I looked into her hazel eyes. And 68 days have passed waiting for her reply. I almost gave up on meeting her again. I haven't slept in two days. I only could think of finally seeing her smile behind the mask, finally hearing her voice and looking into her eyes again. She was a bit nervous, just like me. Actually, I'd never been so excited before. I read her book and hid a small letter in it. It turned out that we read the same books, her favorite movie is also Cinema Paradiso, she loves Morricone, she likes to get wet in the rain, listen to the crickets in the field, swim in the sunset and look at the stars by the campfire. She is an interior decorator and has delicate taste. She just took up photography and she had wanted to get to the lake I lived by. I got lost in her eyes, I drank her words. She just kept telling stories and laughed and looked at me in a way that made me want to touch her. She has been single for two years, wandering around the world, looking for the one, just like me. Ever since we met on the subway, she'd been wondering who I was and whether I'd found her book. She noticed my message only two days ago in the spam folder. That night, everything ceased to exist around me. I only saw her sparkling eyes, heard her sweet voice, as if a pink haze had descended on me. I think this is called love at first sight. Only one thing was wrong. Cabbage pasta is her favorite food, the only dish I can't eat. This was the last chance to meet before the restaurants were closed. There was a total lockdown due to the virus. It seemed that the city had died. Hi, I've brought some packages. Please sign here. Just by hand. Brilliant. Thank you! I hope the guitar made it, too. I was on my way to the island, I wanted to see the place that changed my life once again. I wanted to listen to the silence, the birdsong, and admire the sunrise from my small land. But there was nothing left of it, everything disappeared as if it had never existed. Only my pier remained, which in the fog looked like it was floating in the clouds. Like it was on the edge of the afterlife. There are things in life you have to be able to say goodbye to. You have to let go to make room for new things. Man's destiny is like a winding river. Sometimes it moves straight and fast, sometimes it wanders off the bed. But it always arrives where God has appointed it. And never alone. The Father said that God takes away with one hand and always gives with the other. And everything has a reason that we humans don't need to understand. If I hadn't come to the island, I would have never met Gabriella. My father wrote in his letter that I would find love on the island. But how did he know that? Sometimes you're being guided from above. I think Dad had his share in it. He's got his hands in it for sure. Thank you… IN LOVING MEMORY OF MY FATHER
