No. I am responsible I will not be responsible for this theatre to crumble Vicky. Understand what I'm trying to say Even if you save this theatre from them You can't run this all by yourself Look at how you've become Who will watch a movie here? We'll sell this theatre and start a new life Durai uncle would be wishing for the same What do you know about him? This theatre was brother's life! He will be with me as long as this theatre is! Instead of starting a life selling it... I'll live by running it. This is my life. Be with me if you like - Or else...? - Or else get lost from here! You don't want me, right? Marry someone who speaks English and earns good money That's what you want! Go! Sir. The girl herself has stated that she came to kill him... Why are we having this useless discussion? Sir. What they are doing is illegal Just give me one chance. We'll get the facts of this case only if we raid the factory Then we can close the case easily How can you say that Ranjith? To know about Lucia... we have to arrest Vajravelu Sir. He's the only one talking about Lucia and Vajravelu Is the statement given by that girl a lie? She has confessed! Sir. I want to talk to that girl Is this the statement you gave? I don't believe it. Tell me Why did you give a false statement? Tell me! That's not a lie. OK.

I don't know what happened in our lives. I can't see him in a vegetative state! I can't bear the pain that he suffers everyday, so I did it! Why? Because I love him I love him Do you believe now?

Four foreigners are the reason for this Come... let's hear what they have to say You've done a fabulous work Thank you so much What made you to do this? Actually we did this for our friend Vicky Is he here? He's not here right now He went to a special place There is customer for your table Hi, Divya. Hi.

Cheese One more Will you marry me? What? I said it right Will you marry me? I don't know English. You know how much I've struggled to memorize that in English? You don't have to talk in English Tamil is more than enough I like that Tamil? Will you marry me and become my wife? I can't believe it. I don't know whether this is real or a dream. If it's a dream, then it has been a bad one! If it were a good dream, would we be talking like this? Let today be the last day of that bad dream That's why I called you I don't understand, Vicky! How happy we were in reality! This dream is all my fault I don't know, Vicky. I am not able to bear it! I love you, Divya! Let's not part anymore, Vicky! Forgive me, Divya! I've hurt you a lot in this game of dream and reality I've also hurt you! Close your eyes. I'll tell you. Close your eyes. What are you thinking now? A lonely beach... Evening time... With only me and you... Then... I lie down on your shoulder No, no... Customers' dreams are our dreams. How do you know him? I don't know anything about him. Murugan and Sudaram brought him. Lucia. It not only gives you a good sleep but also a beautiful dream A dream that you always wanted It's for you. Why did he come to meet you? He lacks sleep! He is an insomniac! He met us to get sleeping pills. Take it out. Sir, new ones! How will he get the dream? He writes a story in his diary That is his dream. Is this your dream? This is the story which both of us wrote together, that's all Sir, just a minute Look at the TV. We had kept this interview under wraps for so long This is the right time to telecast that You will know why when you watch this He should get what he desired That is our desire My desire too. Thanks! Welcome Vignesh We thank you on behalf of our television for this interview... ... despite your hectic schedule My pleasure Of course. We have a lot to ask you! First question. Why do you wear glasses? I had an accident when I was a kid If I'm not wrong... You lost your parents in that same accident, didn't you? It's not only my parents that I've lost, but also the colors of my life! I mean I'm color blind Basically , I can't see any color. Everything is black and white. Too much light is also harmful. I always wear these glasses OK. I'm sorry. Does anyone know this fact? No I've never felt like telling anyone. I said it because you asked. Brother Durai knows it No one else You are a great movie star How do you feel about it? It's nice My father was a big star My stardom is a result of that Your dad may be a big star, but... However... Isn't your hard work a reason for this? Sure... I've worked hard But all those who work hard don't become stars I'm very lucky. I think you are being very modest OK. There are many facts like these which no one knows... I'm sure you would've shared all this with someone For example, a close friend or a best friend or people like that I don't have any best or close friend... Since my childhood... I've only seen this world of cinema I don't even know how the outside world is! So... everyone sees me as a star I don't know who really cares about me Or who uses me So I'm always alone. I don't let anyone near me. That's interesting. Everyone has a dream from their childhood I have always dreamt of being a cinema star What dream does Vignesh have? I dream of living the life of an ordinary person Really? 'Ordinary' means? A simple ordinary life without all this stardom I want to eat at the roadside outlets I want to roam on a bicycle I want to live like an ordinary person like everyone. That's my dream. That's my wish. Whatever you get in cinema you won't get it in an ordinary life, is that fine? That's fine! Who is Vignesh in that dream? In my dream... I... I see myself as a torchbearer in a theatre What? Have you ever seen a torchbearer in a theatre? Do you remember their faces? They see everyone... But nobody sees them! Invisible in a crowd! That's... That's really true Anything else from that dream? A love... Thanks Struggle for that love... I've never been through that struggle in reality I like that struggle very much... Do you have a love in reality that is similar to your dream? Isn't heart enough to fall in love? Yes, I love that girl! She too loves me! Is that enough? If we have to live by explaining the reasons... Then I don't need such a life... He has ended his real life He's living the life he wanted in his dreams It's a common mentality... ... to live life like someone else, instead of living their own life The poor wants to live the life of the rich! The rich wants to live the life of an ordinary simple man It's a human tendency to desire what is not available He must have thought the same He was psychologically prepared for it! - Yes, sir. -So if we want to bring him back from his dreams... I mean... to bring what is going on in his subconscious mind to the conscious mind We have to try a holistic approach Why, Vicky? Have I not been close enough to understand you without explanations? Had you told me that you wanted to leave cinema and live a normal life... I wouldn't have become an actress, Vicky! Wake up, Vicky! Get up, Vicky! It's getting late. Aren't you going to the theatre? We have a new movie releasing today and you sleep like this! Get up Vicky! Get ready fast It's been 4 years since marriage and he hasn't changed a bit Come for breakfast soon! Vicky! Got up! What were you dreaming about today? Hmmm I was lying on a bed in a hospital Hospital? Was I with you? How can it be without you! I don't know why you were crying holding my hands! Is it? OK... Go feed her. It's getting late for school Chinnu... Chinnu darling... Chinnu darling... Dad came here. Chinnu Chinnu darling... Look at me See what dad has brought for you... Chinnu You can live the life that you desire Wake up, Vicky! Vicky, please. Vicky. Doctor. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky. Keep talking something... Divya Divya Divya Vicky. Divya - Divya - Vicky. - Chinnu - Vicky. Vicky. - Divya - Vicky. Divya...
