Female reporter: In New York City Peter Gatien sits at the pinnacle of a near monopoly on nightlife. And generally speaking, if it's a hot club, it's most likely owned by Peter Gatien. You see, around here he is king of the night. Well, Friday night is a big club night as you know here in the city. But the problems with the drugs and the fighting have tarnished the club scene. The Limelight and the tunnel, cops say they're a drug buyers paradise where the owner acted like he could do anything and get away with it. He was wrong. He's in jail. Male reporter: Cops raided the place and found rampant drug dealing. Male reporter #2: Peter Gatien allowed over 50 drug dealers to distribute cocaine and hallucinogenics such as ecstasy, roofies and special k to young partygoers. Male reporter #3: Gatien could receive a maximum of life behind bars if convicted on all five counts of racketeering and drug conspiracy charges. Male reporter #4: ...And the possible end of two of New York's most popular nightclubs. Man: And he was basically banished from the United States and cannot come back. Peter Gatien: I grew up in a town called Cornwall, Ontario, a small industrial town of 40,000 people. Brought up catholic, one of five boys. My father was a postman, mother a housewife. Very sort of '50s, middle-class upbringing. Male reporter: When he was 15 Peter Gatien lost an eye playing hockey. Female reporter: He used his $17,000 settlement from his accident to open two blue jeans stores in Ontario. Male reporter: Three years later he sold the store for a 300% profit. Female reporter: With the profits he bought a dilapidated bar in cornwall, Ontario, converting it into a rock club. Did a three-day renovation and opened up with a group called rush, which are really huge now, a Canadian group. And that was my start in the nightclub business. The first month, like anybody else owning a place, I'm the happy owner having drinks with everybody. The place is packed. Things are looking great. Five, six weeks later my checks are starting to bounce. I learned a very early lesson with my first club: That you can't be part of the party, I guess. Female reporter: After just a year in the bar business, he sold his rock club just as disco hit. The sales pitch for disco was just as flashy as the product. And it's created a new generation of disco entrepreneurs. Gatien: I went to the first disco conference here in New York City in '76, '77. I loved America, man. Canada's a great country and I really love it, but opportunity-wise there's no question if you are focused and willing to make the sacrifices and are a little bit lucky, opportunities in America are second to none. Picked up an issue of "the New York times," which I had never read in my life. I looked at the business opportunities and they described this place in Florida. It held 2000 people, $600,000 light system, half-a-million-dollar sound system. The ad went on and on and on. Selling price $400,000. Guess who's on the next flight to Miami? Male reporter: It will be the Limelight. - The Limelight. - The Limelight. - Limelight. - Limelight. The newest nightspot for nightlife. Gatien: Everything had been, prior to that, live entertainment. So the sort of concept was now you were going to a disco and you were the star, you were the entertainment or whatever. So between the-- sort of a little bit of play on words, you know, being in the Limelight and the Limelight lights and all that kind of stuff. So it was just-- it was a good name I thought. From '76 to like almost '80, you could do no wrong in that business. You just couldn't. Everybody was going out. It was a real joie de vivre. I think I was 22 or 23. I probably had one of the largest clubs in America. Female reporter: Gatien's next stop-- Atlanta. Gatien: I took over a bankrupt dinner theater there. Female reporter: The one in Atlanta has a glass-top dance floor that in winter covers a polar bear den and in summer a shark tank. Gatien: It developed a reputation as being and quoted often as being the hottest club in the south. Woman: Why didn't you stay? Gatien: It's been probably said about every industry: Unless you make it in New York you really never made it at all. So that's why I got out of Atlanta. I felt at the time-- you know, I'd been to New York-- that my clubs at least physically were every bit as well- thought-out, put together as any New York club including studio 54. I felt I'd paid enough dues that I could compete in New York. Steve Lewis: Unbelievably exciting time. There were very few rules in terms of buildings, smoking. At that point clubland really did seem like a dream land because it wasn't part of the real world. It was really an insular society. It was a secret still. Nobody knew it except the right people, except the really cool, smart, creative people. I worked at the club called danceteria, the original danceteria on 21st street between 5th and 6th avenues. I mean, I didn't hang out at studio 54 which I always considered to be like 2000 guys with their shirts opened down to their dicks asking what sign you were and 200 unbelievable Elizabeth Taylors or Truman capotes. Mercado: We were the alternative, danceteria, to studio 54. We did rock and roll. Madonna was there, Run D.M.C., Russell Simmons. Even the Beastie Boys got their start there. Lewis: I would go to Max's Kansas City which was Lou Reed, Debbie Harry and Johnny Thunders and the ramones. Mercado: At this point it was the art stars. It was francesco clemente and Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gatien: People were totally uninhibited. And I'll tell you, really uninhibited. Lewis: My first rule was never go home with a girl whose hair could hurt you. This was the way you lived. It was that kind of mentality. I think the drug of choice then was cocaine. That was pretty fashionable. But it was so clandestine. You went in a bathroom stall to do a bump of cocaine and you didn't tell anybody. This was pre-aids, pre-herpes, pre really anybody having buddies that were junkies or coke addicts or freebasing or any of that kind of stuff. So I think nobody really saw the downside of living on the edge. Everyone was having a good time. You need to be original. You need to be innovative. You need to be the best in your industry. You know, you just can't be as good as the next guy. I sort of felt like for the '80s, because the chrome and neon thing had been brought to as far as it could go, that art and architecture was the way to go. So my instructions to a real estate person were I want a historical building if possible. I want a church if possible. I want a strong architectural building with high ceilings. But if you can get me a church that would be perfect. It's not like you can walk up to a pastor and say, "father, how much would you like for your church? I think it would be a terrific nightspot." Male reporter: This is the episcopal church of the holy communion in New York, built in 1846. Male reporter #2: It served briefly as a drug rehabilitation center for down-and-out heroin addicts. After that it stood empty until Peter Gatien came along. Gatien: The fact that it was in the heart of New York was terrific. It was on an Avenue. Anything that's on an Avenue has to have 100,000 people drive by or walk by on any given day. I fell in love with it and started negotiating. Male reporter: Peter bought the old church building for 1.7 million American dollars. It's been declared a historic site and the exterior of the building cannot be altered. Gatien: It had high ceilings, 50-foot ceilings, great arches, incredible woodwork. Male reporter: The church's dedication plaques remain in place, a reminder that the Limelight disco was once a house of prayer. Gatien: There was a main room which also I put two tiers of balconies in it. V.i.p. Rooms upstairs had their own little sound systems. Male reporter: Centuries-old pews make way for the latest sound systems, lights and video screens. Gatien: The square footage, the dimension, the scale of those rooms were just great. Male reporter: Gatien spent close to $5 million on the renovation. Gatien: And we opened up in November of '83. Some people actually opening night came with a huge crucifix with a guy laying on it and, you know, partying all in drag and that kind of stuff. Female reporter: Critics were outraged by what they saw as a desecration. It drew fire from religious groups and media attention because it became the in place for celebrities. Male reporter: Where Yoko Ono and Andy warhol hosted parties during its first week. ♪ This disco used to be a cute cathedral ♪ ♪ where we only play the stuff you want to hear... ♪ Male reporter: There's a trick to making a disco a success: Keep the beautiful people coming back so that ordinary folk can rub shoulders with them. Male reporter #2: It costs $15 to get into this disco. Drinks cost another $5 each, even a coke. Male reporter: As for dress, the flashier the better. Male reporter #2: The theme night is just one of a number of marketing strategies Peter adopted on his way up the disco ladder. Male reporter: On this particular night, a tribute to federico fellini. But modern addictions sometimes destroy the atmosphere of ancient Rome. We need cigarettes. We must have cigarettes. I don't want a total punk crowd. I don't want a total yuppie crowd. I don't want a total gay crowd. I want 20% of everybody. Male reporter: For this crowd, being wild and having fun in a church is part of what keeps them coming back. When I did it in cornwall I felt I was the best at what I do. When I did it in Florida and when I did it in Atlanta and now that I'm here, they're the same ideals. I want to make sure I'm the best at what I do. Male reporter: Right now the small-town boy from cornwall, Ontario, is the hottest thing in New York City. New York and Limelight from '83 to '85 were great. What happened in '85 is aids came on. Lewis: Aids actually squashed club life as we know it. People were not sure-- and I'm talking everybody-- weren't sure whether you contracted aids from as simple as drinking a dirty glass in a bar or kissing somebody. Nobody really knew. Female reporter: Limelight slumped in the mid-'80s and soon Gatien was opening branches in Chicago and London. Later he sold his other Limelights for millions in profit, but the beat still goes on at the original. Gatien: Come the '90s, New York was starting to be back on the rebound. People were finally starting to understand they're not gonna contract aids from drinking a dirty glass or being kissed on the cheek. It was almost like they were freed in the '90s. Where, you know, "god, now we can go out and go nuts again." Mercado: Limelight was very important to Peter because it was his-- let's call it his cash cow. It was a club that had already been there. And it wasn't going anywhere. Lewis: It was a tourist attraction. The idea of seeing a club built in a church was its whole shtick. I don't believe it had a moment of cool until I came on board working-- or until Michael Alig came on board working there. Alig: My scene was traveling from club to club. As a new club would open my scene would travel to that club. For some reason each club went bankrupt after a little while. I was thinking, where am I gonna go now? The only club left that we hadn't bankrupted was Limelight. Gatien: Michael Alig would have come to me to pitch a night. Alig: And he made it very clear. He said, "I've basically seen you bankrupt every club owner in Manhattan and I'm not gonna let you do that to me." Figured, you know, maybe it was something that would fill a hole for three or six months until you develop something better. Mercado: And these little parties just kept on getting bigger and bigger and bigger. ♪ Disco 2000. ♪ Alig: The theory is that you fill a club with great-looking people, beautiful women, gay people, fashion people, a little bit of drag queens and color, and that in and of itself will make the club hot and get a lot of publicity, the right kind of publicity. And then the paying people will start to come. Gatien: And that's how it grew from 700-800 to a consistent 2200-2500 people on a Wednesday night. Apparently there is a crowd of people who are attracted to topless, green transsexuals and six-foot chickens. This is a new kind of entertainment. Let me show it to you. Watch this. It's 4:00 A.M. do you know where your kids are? Well, they could be right here at the Limelight, one of New York's premier nightspots. Lewis: Michael's vision was that he was not alone, that there were thousands of disenfranchised kids all over the country. And with media, mtv and Geraldo and all these kinds of shows, he could reach these kids and say, "come to New York." Male reporter: They're called club kids and they party all night and sleep all day. Lewis: And it was a movement. It was very much Andy warhol's factory. It was very much a society being built. Alig: We were really obnoxious. I mean we were really obnoxious. We threw drinks, we danced on tables and toppled things. Gatien: Basically lived to get dressed at night. Would literally spend hours on their costume, on their makeup, assembling it all day long type thing. And loved to look fabulous. Every aspect of the Limelight was d.I.Y. The kids made their own clothes, they made their own records, they had their own celebrities, they had their own photographers, they had their own videographers. Gatien: I remember Jean Paul gaultier coming in to get inspiration from these kids clothingwise. And a year and a half later every person in long island is wearing platform shoes. Owen: Lord Michael was this kind of wannabe gangster from staten island. I started going to nightclubs at probably 16 years old. Went over to London for a stretch. Male reporter: Every weekend millions of young britons are drawn by the lure of dance music into a magic haven-- clubland. Caruso: The music scene was there. It was completely different than New York City. I mean, New York City had that decadent nightlife. Male reporter: The late '80s rave scene was certainly enterprising. But it was also idealistic, anti-establishment and not profit motivated. Parties were held in warehouses and fields. Caruso: It was irrelevant whether you were good looking or dressed a certain fashion. It was more or less just enjoy the music. Peter Jennings: Rave was driven by a new kind of electronic dance music moving at 140 beats per minute. This wasn't just a couple of kids that got together. This was a global youth culture movement. Man: There was like 25,000 at this party. I've never seen-- it was just a sea of people. Peter Jennings: It was a sea of people on ecstasy. Well, guess what? We've got another drug. It is synthetic and it makes you love everybody. Chemists call it M.D.M.A. For short. Users have a word for it-- ecstasy. Male reporter: At a psychotherapy session in suburban Boston Bob and Marie littlehale were given a dose of m.D.M.A., a drug unregulated, untested and unapproved, to help them explore feelings. M.d.m.a. is fast spreading beyond psychiatric offices where federal agents say the potential for abuse is enormous. We have enough cocaine and heroin and marijuana out there and L.S.D. And P.C.P. And abuse of legitimate drugs. We don't need this to mushroom and become another problem. You're a nice man. I like you. I love you. Male reporter: Accepted or not, Bob and Marie feel the drug was useful to them. You know I love you too. Male reporter: At the very least deserves further research. - Bob: You're beautiful. - Thanks. This morning the drug enforcement administration is announcing its intention to place the drug known as m.D.M.A., or by the street name ecstasy, under emergency controls in schedule 1. Becoming a schedule 1 controlled substance basically means that there was no legitimate use for ecstasy. Male reporter: Possession of ecstasy now carries the same penalties as heroin: Maximum of 15 years imprisonment for illicit traffic or clandestine manufacture or possession with intent to distribute. Peter Jennings: In 1989 ecstasy had become wildly popular in britain. It had all but disappeared in the United States. I did my first hit of ecstasy in a club in London. Female reporter: Ecstasy is a feel-good drug that stimulates the nervous system. Caruso: When you're in the music scene, you just forgot about everything else and the music just sounded incredible and you had this endless energy. Male reporter: In low doses it's a stimulant. High doses can produce hallucinogenic effects similar to l.S.D. Alig: All of a sudden I felt like all of my friends are so fucking beautiful. You heard sound better. People talking to me, their voice sounded like it was coming through a tube. Like it was hitting my eardrum directly. Like I could hear the tinkle of the glasses and like all of these little sounds, I could hear them so precisely. The lighting just was 10 times that more exciting. Jennings: You can dance all night and your sensory perceptions are tuned way up. It is marketed as a way to enhance the techno music experience at raves and clubs. Techno hadn't even been a whisper in New York in the early '90s. It hasn't happened in New York yet. So somebody buy cases of records, bring the music in. The dude who gave me the first pill said, "listen, take these pills along with you. And I guarantee you this drug right here, pure m.D.M.A., is better than any drug they've ever did in their life." I come back to New York with the pills, with the records, brought them to a dj by the name of repete. I said, "Pete, you've got to play this music. Forget about that mushy house stuff. This is that aggressive party music. This is the stuff that's gonna take you there." So now it clicks. All right, I got the drug, I got the music, I don't have the venue. American rave started in the outer boroughs of the city, Brooklyn and staten island mostly. And two of the people who were throwing these raves were lord Michael and dj repete. At one point they had a party in a sleazy little after-hours club in the west village called Japan. I said if these people can pack this much punch into this tiny little sleazy after-hours club, imagine what they could do to Limelight. And the very next afternoon I brought lord Michael to Peter and Steven Lewis sat in on the meeting. Caruso: And Steve was like, "we have a room called the chapel. You do your party there." So when you start getting experimental music, and techno was experimental at that point, you start it on an off night in a small room and see how people react to it. I started seeing the same energy on the dance floor in the '90s I had seen in the '70s and early '80s. Owen: These kids were on the dance floor going crazy. All their inhibitions were gone. Gatien: And then literally within five weeks it was, "we've got to do this on the main floor one night a week." Caruso: And from there we moved it to Friday nights on the main floor. Basically this is how future shock came into play. Yeah yeah. Tonight we welcome you to lord Michael's future shock. Lord Michael in the house. And our very own house dj repete. Lewis: And we were selling out. Caruso: Friday nights Marc berkley took the back end of the club with muscle boys. In future shock there were 3000-4000 people. And this was the only place in New York where you could hear techno at the time. Gatien: When Michael worked for US that year and a half he was definitely working hard and actually bringing good acts in. In fact he even brought Moby. Moby: I DJ'd for Lord Michael a bunch of times. He really was instrumental in developing sort of like the electronic techno rave scene in New York in the late '80s, early '90s. Man: Lord Michael the promoter, he gets the job done! Yo, bass, take it away, boy. ( Techno music playing ) Caruso: It's "Caligula" with music. Gatien: It was virtually sodom and gomorrah. Lewis: It was pagan Rome on acid is what we used to say. Caruso: Orgies going on in the upper chapel. And you had people streaking naked and you had girls on swings. We had this game show called "what's my line?" Where there were several lines of white powdery substance on a podium. And the contestants had to come up on the stage and snort one of the lines and they had five seconds to guess what that was. It was either cocaine or it was special k or it was crushed up rohypnol or it was ecstasy. Then in round two they would go again and we would whittle it down until there was one person barely standing left. With the ecstasy craze being so powerful, what could I do to drive more people to want to get in the club earlier in the evening? He would have ecstasy punch. Take 200 pills, mash them up into a powder, put them in a 55-gallon garbage pail and serve it from the dj booth on the main floor. It was almost like a priest at church or Jesus coming down and the gathering happened. You know, people came with their mouth open. Throw the pills in their mouth. Punch is being served. It was frantic. You just felt like it was degeneracy without negative consequences. Caruso: The initial demo was bridge and tunnel. Alig: Lord Michael's crowd were so unfabulous that they were not used to getting into a Manhattan nightclub. So they turned out in massive numbers. Thousands of people. It was like a cross between a soccer riot and a rave. A bunch of Italian kids from staten island and Brooklyn. In britain we used to call these kids love thugs, which were basically soccer hooligans who had taken ecstasy. This wondrous therapy. And instead of beating each other up, were hugging each other on the dance floor. Moby: And so in one night in the chapel you'd have all the goth kids. In the room adjacent to the chapel you'd have like glamorous transvestites. And then in the main room you'd have all these kids from staten island, long island with their shirts off going crazy to techno. Alig: At one point we had to have four doors because many people were saying, "I won't go in the same door as those people." Moby: But then they'd start drinking and they'd start intermingling where I'm sure people found themselves making out with people they would never have imagined. Like at the beginning of the night they'd go there with their friends and they probably left a changed person. They were taking a lot of ecstasy and ecstasy is the love drug. And it's very difficult to argue or to have that kind of attitude with somebody when you're all on ecstasy. And it kind of brings everybody together and you're all on the same level. So those things combined made everybody get along really well. Female reporter: Ecstasy, all the rage at so called rave parties, is flooding into the country. Caruso: I had a source in London, a woman about 65 years old that wore sundresses. And she'd just tape the ecstasy to their body. Male reporter: Couriers can smuggle between 2-5kg of tablets into the united states on their person. Female reporter: It costs pennies to produce and can be sold for as much as $45 a dose. I was receiving them at about $5-$8 per, depending on the quantity I purchased. In the early stages it was, "give me 10,000." Within months it was, "I need 30,000." Ecstasy went from being this kind of marginal drug, that not that many did it, to becoming what kind of marijuana was to kids in the '60s. Everybody wanted to do ecstasy. There's always a policy: You get caught you're tossed. I was throwing out coke dealers, heroin dealers, pot smokers. If a cop came in and busted you for ecstasy, they didn't arrest you. They took the ecstasy and they threw it in the garbage because ecstasy was not illegal. Gatien: In New York state it was not illegal until '96. It would have been considered more risky or Maverick to have a cigarette in a non-smoking section of a restaurant. Because ecstasy wasn't really regarded as a hard drug. The N.Y.P.D. Were much more interested in cocaine and heroin. So the marching orders back then were: "Don't have any violence in your club, don't be having an ambulance coming around or any of that stuff, keep the streets and sidewalk and whatever clear." Nobody would ever have accepted people openly doing lines of coke and that sort of stuff. "And other than that, we don't bother you." Voters in many of America's big cities go to the polls this Tuesday to pick new mayors. Now opinion polls tell US many voters still have a single issue in mind. In election year '93, crime is king. Let me tell you that I know about the crime that you have to deal with. I understand the fear that you have. Male reporter: There is a crime of violence committed in New York City every four minutes. Male reporter #2: Rapes, armed hold-ups, murder. Male reporter #3: Prostitution and pornography are just as much a part of the times square scene today as the old electric news headlines. Gatien: When I started visiting New York from Atlanta, I'd always remember going down f.D.R. Drive and it'd be like 17 burned-out cars and, you know, graffiti all over the place. And as coming from a pristine town like Atlanta, which was basically a pre-boom city, it was a little frightening. This city in the late '70s and through the '80s and even into the early '90s became the most violent crime-ridden city in the country. The murder rate in New York had hit an astronomical high. They had over 2000 homicides one year. I heard five shots there. Bang bang bang bang. When I looked there I just couldn't believe my eyes seeing the blood on the street. The violence that was taking place on the streets of New York City was directly related to the drug trafficking. Male reporter: For a long time part of the city's lower east side had been described as an open air supermarket for drugs. Silbering: It seemed that New York, we were traditionalists. It would be heroin, it would be cocaine. And that really was the way it went until we had this offshoot in the mid '80s of crack. A cheap form of cocaine with a short intense high. The drug is highly addictive and has spread so rapidly it's regarded as a deadly menace in many communities. Male reporter: Amidst the glamour of Broadway, crack dealers and users have set up shop. It is a drug that is tearing the city apart. It was a rough time. It was a rough time. Male reporter: Rudolph Giuliani gained his fame as a prosecutor. As the former U.S. attorney for New York, he led the investigation into insider trading on wall street. His tough law and order temperament has been criticized. I said, "Rudy, this is a problem for me that you arrested two stockbrokers in their offices and you took 'em out in handcuffs. There was no reason for it. You did it basically to embarrass them." Female reporter: And in the New York mayor's race, the first republican elected since 1965, republican Rudy Giuliani talking tough on law and order. When Giuliani became mayor he decided to make a change. There's no question that Giuliani did a very good job with respect to reducing crime. Crime was really out of control. He brought in bill Bratton to be the police commissioner. Bratton adhered to what you'd call the broken windows theory. Even the smallest crime would be handled very seriously. Little things become big things. Female reporter: Police are cracking down on what they call quality-of-life crimes like traffic violations, subway fare beating and public drunkenness. Male reporter: Things like street drug deals... Female reporter: ...And prostitutes openly at work. Owen: We're not just gonna go after murderers and robbers. We're gonna go after graffiti artists. We're gonna go after squeegee men. We are a very assertive police force. We want to show people improvement in the quality of their life. Giuliani did something that nobody had done before. Male reporter: Where crime figures were once updated only every three months... Female reporter: ...Computers now track every crime committed in the city every day, allowing cops to react instantly to changing crime patterns. Safir: We did it through a program called compstat-- for computerized statistics. What we did was we mapped crime in every borough, every precinct, every block, every building in the city. Which would really hold the precinct commanders accountable for crimes that were committed in their precinct. Male reporter: They look for problems and they'd better find the answers because once a week the big brass downtown chops off the heads of those who don't. Different precincts compete with one another in reducing crime. Female reporter: Many residents who once felt trapped behind closed doors now feel a new sense of Liberty. But others say police initiatives sometimes leads to a use of excessive force. Silbering: What we're having here is the beginnings of a police state. Male reporter: This, say New York civil rights leaders, is the experience of most black men here-- being stopped and frisked. Koch: Crime actually fell radically. Male reporter: Overall crime is down 50%. The murder rate is down to what it was in the early '70s. Female reporter: There were fewer than 1000 murders for the first time in almost 30 years. Giuliani: The first six months of last year crime went down by 1% in the rest of the country. It went down by 16% in New York City. Male reporter: Making New York City a surprising model for fighting crime in other big cities. I contributed to Giuliani's campaign on the second go around. At that point I was at four clubs, a staff of 1000 people. We were a small industry in New York. Female reporter: In New York City, Peter Gatien sits at the pinnacle of a near monopoly on nightlife. It's midnight and the palladium, one of the busiest nightclubs in New York, is hopping. Two years ago when the palladium was near bankruptcy, Gatien assumed the lease and turned it around. ♪ U.S.A. ♪ ♪ U.S.A. ♪ Hello, and welcome to U.S.A., your pleasure destination. Female reporter: The $8 million four-story funhouse is Peter Gatien's crown Jewel. Male reporter: ...Where an adult-sized slide connects the top and bottom floors. Female reporter: Upstairs, a room created by fashion designer Thierry mugler doubles as the v.I.P. Lounge. Its centerpiece-- a stairway that leads nowhere. Man: It was the premier club in all of New York City nightlife. Female reporter: Soon Gatien will have to divide his attention among four clubs. The tunnel is another defunct club he plans to revive with a subway theme. I'd never been in the tunnel in my life. It's this huge warehouse. And it is dark. Since it's a tunnel, literally a tunnel, it has this mystique. It's like being in a subway. It always feels like an underground party. ( Techno music playing ) The tunnel is 50,000 square feet. Silbering: I couldn't see two feet in front of me. Lewis: It has so many rooms and so many nooks and crannies. Silbering: They have blowjobs going on. There's sex here. And I walk in there with Peter. And Peter says, "I'll be back in a minute." He had to run off. He leaves me in the middle of the tunnel. If he didn't come back-- and it was about five minutes, I was getting worried that he wasn't going to come back-- I think to this day I'd still be looking to find my way out. What's up, y'all? This is cherub and I am at the tunnel sunday night like we do every sunday. Only today is the nas record release party. I got 50 cent here, my personal friend, my favorite rapper in the world. Hey, what up? Gatien: We're doing the sunday night that "source" magazine quoted as being probably one of the most influential nights for hip hop that there ever was. Funkmaster flex, he was the one that organized it. We used to get everybody from Jay-Z to puffy. You name it, they'd perform there for free. Drop that shit for me straight up. - Help me out. - Jig, jig, jig, jig-- - jigga... - Crowd: What? - What? - Jigga... - Crowd: Who? - ( Beatboxing ) - Crowd: Jigga what? - ( Beatboxing ) Crowd: Jigga who? Gatien: Hip hop is the dominant music in society. It's like rock and roll now is like a way way way distant second. Yeah. What's up? Gettin' real sticky icky, icky, icky, icky. Ooh-whee! Owen: You can go and you can bump into some important hip-hop producer. So it was a place where deals were done, where new music was heard. It was an important part of the culture in New York. Put your motherfucking hands up one time. Put your motherfucking hands up. ( Rapping ) Lewis: It was a gold mine, sunday nights. Gatien: It was a night-- and I've done a lot of nights in my life where I can actually say not 70% of the crowd was dancing and not 80% of the crowd was dancing-- 100% of the crowd was dancing. Even big security girls would be doing pirouettes and whatever. It was a great night. ♪ Me and my operation, running New York night scene ♪ ♪ with one eye closed like Peter Gatien ♪ ♪ none of our foes have an idea ♪ ♪ back in the days to fool the feds... ♪ Lewis: 4000 people into the tunnel, 5000-6000 people into the palladium, 4000 people into Limelight, and let's say 2500 into U.S.A. 3000. Male reporter: 15,000 people a night dance to the tune Peter Gatien plays in Manhattan clubs. Owen: He was pulling in 50,000 customers on a weekend. Female reporter: Gatien predicts with all four clubs open for business revenues will reach the $30-million-a-year Mark. Gatien: Figure an average of about 150,000 a week times four. Male reporter: As midnight approaches in the city's hottest hot spots, as the bass from the speakers rattles your bones and pounds your ears, a single cool watchful eye looks over it all. It is the eye of Peter Gatien, the lord of late night. Moby: Peter Gatien was an impresario. There was a magical quality associated to everything he did. Because everything he did was huge. Everything he did seemed completely unsustainable. He had balls, you know? It ain't easy opening a nightclub. Going for four, that's a cowboy. He went for the four biggest places on the block, hired everybody that was cool, and he tried to run an empire. Female reporter: The music is going to be loud and the dancing hot. In a special report meet the mystery man who rules New York's nightclub scene. Alig: Club owners of the good clubs-- Steve Rubell at studio 54, Eric goode at area-- these were genuine party people who loved being there. They loved the attention, they loved the fabulousness. They hosted their own clubs. They gave away drinks. They were part of the festivities. That wasn't Peter. Owen: His profile was lower than a limbo dancer's. Mercado: He was just this shadowy figure who would occasionally show up. And the moment he showed up everyone would get anxious 'cause he was the boss. Alig: I told him. I said, "people think you are in your office counting shekels and laughing at people and profiting from everybody else's fabulousity and they resent you for it. You have to go out and make it look like you're having a good time." And I would have to literally drag him onto the dance floor and prop him up somewhere. Male reporter: To Gatien, the party life is his business, a business which involves 16-hour days, six days a week. There has to be at least so many departments and then subdepartments within those departments. You would have general managers of each of the clubs, bartenders, busboys, security. Then you would have the accounting staff, the art staff, the people that designed the invites. Then you would have promoters. You're talking four clubs here, you're talking about a total of 20 nights. So you're talking a total of 55 groups of promoters 'cause it takes more than one promoter to do any given night. A place like palladium or Limelight you got different rooms. Sometimes you would have different parties in different rooms. So you could have three invites per club per night. That all has to be designed, put together, disseminated. When we had Limelight we had rock and roll church sundays, which was a legendary night. Lewis: You'd hang out with axl Rose and Jon bon jovi and all that kind of people there constantly. Tuesday night at that time was run by a guy named Neville Wells. He did a night called communion, which was an alternative music type night. Gatien: We had smashing pumpkins. And then Wednesday was Michael Alig's disco 2000. Thursday was more of like a model's night. Friday was techno. Saturday night junior vasquez, palladium, he plays long sets. That night could end as early as 7:00 and sometimes 11:00 the next day. When I had four places, I'd do my rounds. Palladium was usually the last place that I left. You really have to be a legitimate, hard-working person to survive the nightclub business. It's not a picnic. It's not a party. It's a very serious business. Male reporter: In Manhattan where million-dollar clubs are hot for a month or two and then often fold, Gatien has known more than a decade of huge success. Did we own the city's nightlife? We owned it. We were the leaders in nightlife. Not just in New York City, but in the world. - ( Cheering, shouting ) - ( Techno music playing ) Are you ready, baby? Gilbride: There were a number of overdoses in the city. We tracked hospital overdose reports. Where some of these clubs were we saw increases in overdoses. Gilbride: Ecstasy was considered by an age group of say 18-to 25-year-olds as a safer type of drug to use. It wasn't as bad as say cocaine or heroin, which was a fallacy. Woman: Patients who have used ecstasy can come in presenting with many different complaints. They can range from patients who are unconscious, who are in a coma, whose temperatures are very high and are severely dehydrated. Gilbride: You have kidney failure. You have cardiovascular failure, which had resulted in death. Man: 'Cause over time drugs like speed and ecstasy can change their brain. Male reporter: U.S. officials are concerned that ecstasy is often mixed with other more dangerous drugs. Linda lacewell: Pills that are made out of speed, pills laced with heroin, with p.C.P., with really anything imaginable. Gatien: A guy named Nicholas marinelli supposedly bought drugs at Limelight, went back home and died the next night. His parents were connected to New Jersey governor Tom kean. Kean, I believe, called Giuliani directly. John dabrowski: And lodged a complaint against Peter claiming that their son died from an overdose of ecstasy. Giuliani called the dogs in. When you let a 17-year-old with Times Square I.D. Into a club they're bound to get drink. They're bound to possibly get drugs if drugs are present in the club. And I think that's what happened. As it turns out, if you look at the autopsy, it says the kid committed suicide. His cause of death was hanging by asphyxiation, that's what the death certificate said. But I think the parents believed that somehow Peter Gatien was to blame for their kid's death. And because they knew a lot of people, they decided to do something about it. It was a radical change in philosophy when Giuliani came in. I mean the idea before was that nightclubs weren't even worth bothering with. We're got real criminals to go after. 10 years before, city hall couldn't have cared less about kids taking drugs in nightclubs. The crack epidemic pretty much ended. Crime went way down, but you still had all these policemen. And then suddenly they had some time on their hands, so I think that's when the crackdown started. The hammer was-- yeah, it really came down. There were various nightclubs that were very well known for selling ecstasy and other drugs of abuse. Silbering: Limelight was a club that kept coming up. - Moby: Everybody was high. - An open-air drug market, the nightclubs-- people were just going in there like they were at a fair. What happened at the Limelight was nothing new. You can see that with any drug-based subculture. It's the same thing that happened in haight-ashbury with the hippies in 1967. It all starts out with good vibes and everybody loving each other. So you have the summer of love. But then that's followed by the winter of hate. People started smoking marijuana and doing acid. And then they started doing meth and heroin, and that really changed the whole tone of the culture. And a very similar thing happened at the Limelight. If they'd stuck to ecstasy that would have been one thing. But what happened was the quality of ecstasy it declined rapidly, so people started looking for new highs. And they came across this thing called special k, ketamine, which is an animal tranquilizer. Now special k has exactly the opposite effect to ecstasy. When there was just ecstasy, it's a very social drug. Special k, on the other hand, is a very antisocial drug. So on special k and rohypnol you started noticing what we called k-heads. They were zombies, basically. 1989, 1990, a night at the Limelight would be people throwing their hands in the air having a great time. Fast-forward a couple of years and it's kids from the suburbs on special k just sitting on the dance floor staring at their feet. Owen: We're not just talking about ecstasy and k. I mean there was everything in that club. It was a pills- and-powder circus. You can't hide cocaine easy. 'Cause you're seeing people. And you're seeing it's a much different deal. But a pill is real easy. Is someone taking a pill? Is it an aspirin? Is it a tic tac? A life saver? What are they putting in their mouth? Bob: And ecstasy back then wasn't even on the D.E.A. Radar. This is something totally new and something totally different. We actually had to educate ourselves and educate our managers and supervisors. D.e.a. Started to get involved in ecstasy investigations around 1996. Benjamin brafman: Ecstasy was new. Ecstasy was not understood. Ecstasy was not even a crime under New York state law. So you had this confluence of new drug, new investigative techniques, and you had new sources that were coming in. And the D.E.A., to its credit and in fairness, was trying to learn as they went along. This is your boy Sean Bradley. Owen: This kid Sean Bradley, very minor drug dealer at the tunnel. I threw him out of the club. We searched him. He didn't have any weapons on him, but he did have drugs. And we 86'd him. And I guess that started the whole thing. Because I guess two months later... Sean Bradley got arrested in New Jersey for counterfeit money by the secret service. Gatien: Sean Bradley, who apparently went to clubs including mine, said, "I understand the New York nightclub scene. I'll introduce you to it." Told them he knew how drugs were being distributed in New York City. Secret service contacted D.E.A. Owen: And then the two D.E.A. Agents gagne and germanowski come over and meet Bradley. They tell Sean Bradley there's these seizure laws. When all the clubs are seized by the government and they're all sold off, Bradley's gonna be making $250,000. And meanwhile they were paying him, I think it was $1000 a week cash. Now this is a kid who couldn't hold down a day job. He's a penny ante drug dealer. This was a big payday for him. Dabrowski: And now he became an informant for the D.E.A. Bradley's role is to get gagne and germanowski into the inner sanctum. Bradley takes them to pat field's in the west village, you know, this very trendy club kid fashion store, and dresses these thick-necked, muscular D.E.A. Agents up as club kids. Germanowski was the one in the long black dress with a slit up the side. Gagne, who is less fashion forward, he went for this kind of suburban punk look with a dog collar. The worst drag queens I'd ever seen. And he gets them into the v.I.P. Rooms. They get to see all the drug action going on. Okay, this is Sean Bradley. Stay tuned. Female reporter: The Limelight is a former church turned into a nightspot. The tunnel is a former warehouse for subway cars. But the feds say both nightclubs are really drug supermarkets where the owner acted like he could do anything and get away with it. He was wrong. He's in jail. A very important cell of a very significant distribution organization has been immobilized. Male reporter: People come to the Limelight to be seen, to have a good time and prosecutors allege they also come here to buy the drug ecstasy. Male reporter #2: Known variously as toucans, fruit loops and playboys, these are some of the ecstasy tablets now serving as evidence in the case against 24 people including the owner of the tunnel and Limelight nightclubs. All have been charged with conspiracy to sell ecstasy, which could mean a maximum of 20 years in prison, a $1 million fine and the possible end of two of New York's most popular nightclubs. Investigators say the club's drug selling was an incredible commercial enterprise with international connections and a monopoly well organized enough to keep outside dealers from getting in on the action. These clubs existed to distribute these substances. Male reporter #2: Gatien's attorney said, "in 20 years of operating clubs Gatien had never condoned drug use of any kind, nor had he ever been cited for drug use violations." I think this was an ill-advised indictment. I think Mr. Gatien was deemed to be a trophy, if you will, by the drug enforcement people who had access to those clubs. And I think when we get into a courtroom we're gonna find that they made a terrible mistake here. Male reporter #2: Tonight, Gatien is in jail. Gatien: I ended up that day finally at a federal lockup in Brooklyn. The next morning the lights go on at 6:00 and within 10 minutes I'm being approached for any drug that I wanted-- heroin, coke. I'm supposed to be able to prevent it, but meanwhile in a place where you're strip-searched nine times before you even get up to your bed, it's okay for them to have it. Male reporter: He is currently out on bail of $1 million and is expected to go on trial next year. It's important to note here that despite the accusations, the clubs continue to operate and will right up until the trial for Mr. Gatien, which isn't expected to begin until the middle of 1997. I assume that combination of the district attorney, the federal prosecutor, the corporation counsel and the police department-- they are exhausting all of the penalties that they can legally exact from that operation. You want my view, that operation has proven that they can operate legally and they can operate within reasonable bounds. Safir: One of the unique things in this city is there's basically a civil nuisance abatement law which says that if there were three occurrences within a year in a particular business that are crimes, you can apply to the court to shut them for a year. And we did that in a number of venues. Under the nuisance abatement laws I had to perform three undercover purchases in an open and notorious environment. After receiving coaching from Bob gagne and Matt germanowski, I was under the understanding that I needed to make a certain amount of buys and busts at the Limelight. Then we were to move on to the tunnel. Male reporter: The party's over. Police clear the dance floor at two top hot spots. Male reporter #2: Big blow to nightlife here in Manhattan tonight as police close down two major dance clubs on the Eve of the weekend. Female reporter: The Limelight and the tunnel, cops say they're a drug buyer's paradise. Male reporter #3: Many wonder however if this is about drugs or more about getting controversial club owner Peter Gatien. Male reporter #4: New York City police moved in at midnight on the trendy Limelight and tunnel clubs executing a court order to eject the patrons and close the nightspots down. Male reporter #5: Clubs were closed under new York's nuisance abatement law which permits the shuttering of establishments where narcotics are sold. Man: They blew it all out of proportion. I mean it's nothing you couldn't find on any corner in New York City. I mean they've blown this whole thing out of proportion. I really think it's unfair. Male reporter: Last night's closures were not part of the federal indictments, but related to cocaine busts made earlier in the day by New York City police. Safir: It was like a scene from a movie set, this dark place full of dirty couches and a lot of stoned people. There were three arrests made this afternoon of an employee of the Limelight and two associates based on evidence gathered at the Limelight. Yes, there were four undercover buys made at the tunnel over a year period. And we get anywheres from 5000 to 10,000 people over a weekend. That's like over 100,000 people, and yet there were only four undercover drug buys. I think that's a pretty good standard. And this is a signal that we're not gonna tolerate the use of businesses as drug- selling locations in the city. Give me a break. Like this was gonna change the whole city. Male reporter: Under the city's nuisance abatement law, both the Limelight and the tunnel here can be closed for up to a year. But according to Peter Gatien's attorney, he will move in court next week to have both clubs reopened. That closure is a result of Sean kirkham totally orchestrating, manipulating it to a point where we couldn't have prevented those sales. Other than not opening our doors that night-- would have been the only way we could have prevented that. Kirkham: I'd been an informant for almost six years at that point in my life. I've worked with countless agencies. I've worked with hundreds of agents. Without question it's physically impossible to prevent people like me from closing down your place of business. All it takes is a simple phone call to a drug dealer to come to your place of occupation. I'd have to make a drug purchase. And under the nuisance abatement laws your business will be closed. Gatien: I never recovered from that summer of-- I'll call it the summer of Sean kirkham. You know, if you go look back to the times of the 1940s when the Nazis were on trial at nuremberg and they said they were doing a job, it's much how I felt. I was just doing a job. I was getting paid for it. I didn't think of the consequences in terms of being labeled a confidential informant or a rat. So it was, for me, there was no pride in doing a job. It was just a job and I tried to do the best that I could. This club has been shut down before and it quickly reopened. And according to police quickly became a drug supermarket again. We'll see what happens this time. Gatien: I had to make a deal with the city where I agreed to close Limelight for a year. Tunnel I think, if I remember right, was closed three and a half months. A little later I had to sell palladium. I got a half million dollars. I needed the cash for the defense. Kirkham: The prosecutors had hoped that the money generated from the nightclubs would dry up and Mr. Gatien would no longer be able to afford to pay his legal defense. I believe wholeheartedly that their main objective was that if we financially break him he's gonna plead. And I went down to the U.S. attorney's office and said, "this is like crazy. If we wanted to resolve the case, what would be the sentencing guidelines that you would think was appropriate?" And they looked at me and they said, "11 years." They assessed Peter Gatien criminal responsibility for every pill that was sold in his club by anyone that they seized in the course of the investigation. They multiplied out the math and it came to 11 years. I looked at them like they were nuts. To suggest that Peter Gatien, who was running four venues at the same time, could be criminally responsible for what went on at any given moment in any one of the venues whether he was there or not was something I thought I could win in a courtroom. If you go to any rock concert, for example, at either the meadowlands or at Madison square garden, you're gonna have hundreds if not thousands of people there using drugs and you don't see the management or the ownership of the meadowlands or Madison square garden indicted. Regardless how prominent the individual is, I never saw that type of scorched-earth mentality. The motto was: Get Gatien at all costs. This was a resume case, quite frankly. A resume case to a prosecutor is it's gonna be covered by all of the tabloids, all of the media. If you win you're a star. A lot of those prosecutors want to become Giuliani someday. How do you do it? By taking down big scalps. How do you do it? By getting your name in print. Mercado: The headline of getting Peter Gatien was really a primary reason why he got indicted. Who is the biggest owner of nightclubs in New York City? Who's the big fish? What better way a person to choose to make an example of than the one who's on the top? Brafman: There was no face to ecstasy when they indicted Peter. And when you got an eyepatch and a face, it makes you an even more attractive person to target. Alig: Every single club was saturated with special k and rohypnol, crystal meth, ecstasy and cocaine. But they didn't have an evil sinister eyepatched figurehead like Peter Gatien at the helm. Owen: Regular folk had no idea who owned nightclubs like sound factory or twilo. A lot of people knew who Peter Gatien was. And so he became this easy target, all the ills of nightlife projected onto him. And by bringing him down it could serve as a lesson to other club owners to behave. Female reporter: Now the indictment against him has expanded to include throwing marathon parties, binging on drugs for days. In a five-year period I had four parties which I did drugs in a hotel. Alig: Peter was the best kind of drug user that there can be. He would go three months, four months without using any drugs. And when I say any drugs he wouldn't have a glass of champagne. He would go on a binge for three or four days. Get girls there, do a lot of cocaine, drink, party. The government argued without any basis in fact whatsoever to do so that the parties at the hotel were rewards for people who worked for Peter and therefore was related to the racketeering enterprise. This was simply fundamentally false. Gatien: It dirtied me. You get a middle-class or, you know, suburban jury or whatever. The guy's at a hotel with girls and they're partying and doing drugs. God, what an awful person he is. Let's put him away. Brafman: There was a young prosecutor, very little experience. Her name was Michele Adelman. I mean she was obsessed with Peter. She had a big picture of Peter behind her desk in her office. I remember going in there one day and I said, "this is not healthy. Get a life. This is just a case." So at that point it's just the two women, Michele Adelman and Lisa fleishman. Ben speculated that maybe they wanted a more experienced guy. They brought out the senior person in the eastern district. Owen: So they brought in Eric friedberg. Brafman: He was chief of the narcotics bureau at the time. Owen: He had a reputation as a straight shooter, tough but fair. Brafman: Very competent, very experienced, very seasoned person. And he was spearheading the case. Owen: You got to understand, this was a very high profile case. A lot of people's reputations are on the line here, all right? They spent millions of dollars, tens of thousands of man-hours and they were determined to bring down Peter Gatien no matter what. I was of the illusion that federal enforcement, whether it's prosecutors or D.E.A., were honorable and didn't bend rules. The people going after him had no morals. They're as bad as anybody else. Brafman: The three superstar witnesses that were gonna be the centerpiece of the government's case were Sean Bradley who started this investigation, Michael Alig and Sean kirkham. And before the trial started all three had imploded. Their key informant, Sean Bradley, got arrested for selling drugs at a Jersey mall. The same place where he got busted a year previously with the counterfeit money. He now is upset with the government because he had to spend five days in jail. He makes all these serious allegations about the conduct of gagne and germanowski, the two D.E.A. Agents. Dabrowski: Sean Bradley writes a letter to a judge implicating that the D.E.A. Agents were not following proper procedures. They bought him gifts, they skimmed money off him, they let him use and sell drugs, and they also participated in the use and sale of drugs at the clubs. Owen: He claimed that they were surveying Peter Gatien's office in a warehouse across the street, the office at the tunnel. They saw Peter Gatien scratching his nose in his office, gagne joked, "oh it looks like Peter's doing coke." And that incident ended up in the D.E.A. Report as Peter Gatien using a one-hitter. Dabrowski: He said that Peter did coke and he had it in his drawer. And we actually went, looked at the desk, found out there's no drawers. That was another one of the allegations that Sean Bradley said that didn't happen. They made it up. I never-- and I use the word never-- did any illegal drugs-- even pot or ecstasy, anything like that-- in my life at any of my venues. Dabrowski: Government lost Sean Bradley so now they reach out to Michael Alig. Michael agreed because they told him they had enough information to arrest him. Lewis: He was completely fucked up at this point in his life. Drug-crazed insane. Owen: Who knew more about the drug dealing at the Limelight than Michael Alig? Little problem though. Little problem. Michael had dismembered his roommate and dumped him in the Hudson river. A fellow by the name of angel melendez disappeared. Angel melendez lived with Michael Alig. Gatien: The whole of New York City, at least the whole of people that went out and sort of knew what was going on in New York City, had heard the rumor of Michael Alig murdering this person. Owen: I had maybe six, seven people close to Michael all saying that Michael had confessed to doing this thing. Lewis: He approached me at the Limelight. He danced up to me wearing, you know, a full clown costume, you know, makeup, colored hair, the whole nine yards. And he asked me to borrow my car. And I said, "what do you need it for?" And he said, "I just killed angel and I want to get rid of the body." And I said, "excuse me?" And he said, "I just killed angel. He's in my bathtub. I'm gonna chop him up and get rid of the body." I said, "Michael, get the fuck away from me." Matt and Bob knew about the murder the way that Peter knew about the drugs in the club. I mean-- and when I say that I mean they didn't-- they sort of figured maybe it happened, maybe it didn't. And if it did, we don't want to know. Owen: As far as they were concerned, if Michael Alig could give them Peter Gatien's scalp, why should they care? And at that point, as far as they were concerned, there was no absolute proof because there was no body. But once it starts hitting "details" and "the New York post" and stuff like that, they started floating ideas about the state case and wrapping it up with a federal thing and charging me with one thing and making me go to jail for something like three years. Owen: The body had no hands or legs so they couldn't do fingerprints, but they did dental records. Dabrowski: They positively identified that was angel melendez. Now they had a body. They go out and they arrest Michael Alig for the murder of angel melendez. Owen: After he's arrested and he's in rikers island, the D.E.A. Pay him two more visits-- gagne and germanowski. I was deathly sick. I was withdrawing from heroin, throwing up. They asked the superintendent if they could take me out for a drive. I told them, you know, I'm very sick. I cannot focus on any of these questions that you want to ask me about Peter Gatien right now. And so they let me call Brian my drug dealer from their car phone. And I called him and I said, "can you please meet me?" He said yes. And they got out of the car and let Brian come in the car and they walked up the block. Me and Brian were doing dope in their back seat. And every time I was sick they came and picked me up and took me to Brian. Dabrowski: So now Michael Alig flips on the D.E.A. Alig: I fucked over somebody who was very close to me, like who was really more of a father figure than my own father. And I just-- I didn't think I would be able to live with myself. His usefulness as an informant was done. Out of the blue we get a call and this guy on the end of the phone says, "I'm Sean kirkham." I had heard that name. I knew he was one of the sort of witness-informant types who were floating around in this cesspool of a case. And it was like, "oh my god. What do I do with this guy?" In early 1996 I relocated back to New York City where I was living with these two male escorts. They had placed ads in the back of a gay magazine called "hx." When these roommates were unable to fill slots I would step in to make a few extra bucks. And now he wants to tell US a story about how he got involved with the Peter Gatien case. The big thing, Sean said, was that he had this affair with Eric friedberg, the lead prosecutor in the case. He saw a picture in the paper. Oh, I recognize this guy. Kirkham: Imagine to my surprise I had seen in the press Eric friedberg a U.S. attorney. It sounds nuts that a federal prosecutor would be with the likes of Sean kirkham. I had decided to contact him because now I had a contact within the U.S. attorney's office. Kirkham actually volunteered his services. At first he was a little shocked that I had called him during the daytime. And I told him that I had worked once at club U.S.A. For Peter Gatien. He called me two days later and said that he had set up an appointment with Bob gagne and Matt germanowski, the D.E.A. Agents involved in the Peter Gatien case. Sean kirkham made, you know, a crazy allegation about a personal relationship with the prosecutor. I personally never believed it to be true. I had an obligation to vet it to see what happened. We were a little skeptical about him. So he gave US information down in Miami that we can go and check out. I went to Miami, Florida. I spoke to an F.B.I. Who said he was his handler at the time. He told me Sean was a very reliable informant, except that sometimes he exaggerated a little bit. Pretty much 90% of what he says is right on the money. It's the other 10% you have to worry about. As far as the credibility of him doing anything with the prosecutor, we could not substantiate any such thing. So maybe the allegation fell under the 10% you got to worry about, right? Maybe that was the case. I could never confirm it one way or the other. A lot of the times I could confirm what Sean said, not this time. But what he did was he put the fear of god into friedberg because it would have been the end of his career if it was true. And even if it wasn't true, the sheer allegation would have been very problematic on the Eve of the trial. And we took that evidence, went to the U.S. attorney's office and said, "look, I don't know what's going on with your witnesses, but one of them is out there peddling information. We may be aggressive criminal lawyers, but we're honest people." Kirkham: I was arrested, detained, charged and I pled guilty to one count of obstruction of justice-- lying to a federal agent. Probably the most aggravating is a guy like Sean kirkham is a terrific person when his services are required to put somebody in jail. He's believable. They'll put him under oath. They'll put somebody in jail for 20 years. Dah dah dah. The minute he crosses their line, okay, they become an ultimate scumbag. Owen: The case was in serious trouble. You had three cooperating witnesses who all turned on the government and were all separately and without collusion making serious accusations of government misconduct. We're basically people who have never been in trouble before. This was our first brush with the law. And it was very frightening to have our first brush with the law be these big D.E.A. Agents that are making this big federal case against Peter. So as the case progressed and they saw what they were gonna have to do, that they were gonna have to lie and do all this stuff, people just started dropping off. We don't want to have anything to do with that, you know? And also Peter's a decent person. People didn't want to do that to Peter Gatien. You know? They liked him. I liked him. Now they have a gentleman by the name of Michael Caruso. Gatien: Caruso at that point had been long gone from Limelight. That whole crew bolted to Florida in '92, '93. All the little guys had gotten arrested already. That only leaves US. Then a "village voice" story comes. And it discloses our drug operation, our complete enterprise. Owen: And so, you know, like any article, I had to give him a right to reply. I invited Caruso up to the office, to "the village voice." There's this story coming out on Wednesday and it basically says you were the Limelight's drug kingpin. I need your reaction. And he's like, "oh yeah, it's bullshit." This and this and that. I said, "well, Michael, I have this person saying this and that person..." We went through the whole thing. Then he starts, "I've known you for years, frank. Why are you doing this to me? You know I've just had a baby." I said, "that's got nothing to do with it." I said, "this is what I got." And he starts shaking like this. I think, "uh-oh. He's gonna come across the room and try and strangle me." Then all of a sudden he just bursts into tears and starts blubbering like a spanked toddler. ( Sobbing ) He gets up and he goes, "what do you think I should do? Do you have any advice?" And I just said, "yeah, Michael, I think you should get a really good lawyer." And sure enough we get picked up. Dabrowski: They go and arrest Michael Caruso now, the fourth informant in the case. What do you want to do? I want to take the deal against Peter. Male reporter: Caruso pleaded guilty to felony drug charges in a cooperation agreement with the feds. Caruso: Tell the background story of the nightlife. Tell US about your drug dealing. Tell US about the crimes you've committed. Admit to everything you've ever done. Owen: Michael Caruso wanted to be the al Capone of raves. And for a while he was. Caruso: At that time we had the best music, we had the best venues, we had the best drugs, we had the biggest crowds, we hired all the best door people. It was a world within a world. Male reporter: He is just one of a number of witnesses the feds claim will show how the Canadian-born Gatien employed a network of people to make millions of dollars in profits. Owen: It really was this rogues' gallery of staten island scumbags that they thought they could use to put away Peter Gatien. And now they became the informants against Peter. They became the government's case. Male reporter: Gatien could receive a maximum of life behind bars if convicted on all five counts of racketeering and drug conspiracy charges. Peter Gatien is used to being the center of attention at his clubs the Limelight and the tunnel. Today the venue is a courtroom at his trial. Brafman: You get accused of a crime that you really didn't commit and you face the prospect of maybe 10-20 years in prison. I cannot think of anything more frightening. It's like being in a bad dream and you're walking through sort of like a zombie. But you know you can't be a zombie. You have to be engaged. You have to be focused. And you have to deal with your reality at that point. Brafman: And then when you're being put out of business so you really can't defend yourself and your adversary is the United States government with unlimited resources and badges and guns and handcuffs, it's very intimidating. The feds rarely rarely ever lose a drug case like this. While you have the presumption of innocence, most people on a jury look at you and they say, "I don't think the government picked you out of the yellow pages to get indicted." So you stand with a great deal of prejudice in a courtroom. Were we confident? We were hopeful, okay? I mean you didn't want to even entertain the possibility that you would not win. You don't even let your mind go there. It's not like, "let me start planning prison life. Let me start planning how I'm gonna take care of my family." You don't even entertain those kind of thoughts. To start to deal with that reality would be too depressing. Male reporter: Today Peter Gatien's in federal court here. He's charged with racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs. A prosecutor told the jury that Peter Gatien allowed over 50 drugs dealers to distribute cocaine and hallucinogenics such as ecstasy, roofies and special k to young partygoers invited to Gatien's clubs. Male reporter #2: Nightclubs that the feds describe as nothing more than massive drug supermarkets to their young patrons. Male reporter: The prosecution also detailed how security guards tipped off so-called house dealers about undercover cops and threw out the competitive drug dealers who didn't have Gatien's nod of approval. Gatien: I had a staff of 1000 people. Over a five-year period probably turned it over three times. They couldn't produce five security people-- with the might of the united states that could put pressure on somebody saying, "did you get instructions from anybody in Gatien's camp to allow this one or that one to operate in there?" They couldn't 'cause they didn't exist. Owen: And I remember the opening day of the trial Michele Adelman, she got up and she said upfront right at the beginning of her opening statements that they had no evidence that Peter Gatien personally profited from the drug sales at the Limelight. So what the hell were we doing there? Some of the government witnesses will include several of Gatien's former pals and employees. The trial's expected to last about a month. Male reporter: Their star witness Michael Caruso, a.k.a. Lord Michael, took the stand. Caruso, a Limelight club employee who prosecutors say was Gatien's right-hand man testified against his former boss. Owen: They are so desperate to build this case that they base the whole case on the testimony of the most unreliable scumbag in a case filled with unreliable scumbags. I mean that really is a measure of their desperation that they would even think of putting somebody like lord Michael on the witness stand. Brafman: We really used Michael Caruso on cross to establish what I thought was the fundamental legitimacy of Peter Gatien's operation, to establish the vastness of Peter's operation. And the numbers were extraordinary. We were trying to show even if you had some drug dealing going on at the club, with the millions of people who came through that club, with the millions of dollars that Peter was making, this was an insignificant part of the operation. And nobody, from Caruso on down, ever claimed they gave Peter Gatien a nickel as a result of any money that they made selling drugs. Peter never ever ever asked for any financial kickback from drugs. Never once suggested he would give me money to finance my enterprise. Peter wasn't getting any kickbacks from drug dealers. Peter was making money hand over fist. I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars a week. For, you know, what, a few extra thousand dollars, to risk all of that? No. Peter was a businessman, but he wasn't abnormally greedy like that. Would I be that dumb enough to expose a fairly high net worth, which I thought I had back then, and everything that I'd worked for since I'm 16 years old to get a cut on this $20 pill that's being put out? I mean it's beyond absurd. I'm sitting there saying I did 200 years worth of crimes and so are my codefendants. Here's a civilian who's never got arrested. It's his word against ours. How could we ever be credible on the stand for the jurors to believe what we're saying? Michael Caruso came with, you know, a substantial amount of baggage. Owen: Brafman went through all the crimes that Caruso was forced to admit as part of his cooperation agreement. There were home invasions, kidnappings. When I say kidnap, no children involved of course. We're just talking about common day kidnapping, extortion attempts. I mean I ripped off my resource. I just took the drugs, said, "get back on your flight and leave." Then I ripped off the person who was gonna buy them. And Damon burett was a young boy living with lord Michael. He came to Limelight for a job but he was too young. They wouldn't hire him so he made him like his houseboy. He was my... Housekeeper at one point slash promoter. Dabrowski: One time lord Michael comes home and Damon has suffered a bullet wound to the head. He committed suicide in my apartment. The cops come around, right? Caruso is holding this gun in his hand. Manages to bullshit the cops that it was a suicide attempt. I didn't buy that story and neither did anybody else. Everybody thought he got murdered. Everybody believed that lord Michael had Damon whacked because Damon was coming up short in drug deals. Plus Damon was being investigated by the police. I took the tox report and I went to a medical examiner and a pathologist. He had so much drugs in him, so much valium, that he couldn't pull a trigger. Plus the bullet went into the head and it went in at a downward trajectory. Most people who shoot themselves, the gun is up and the bullet comes up through the head. Wasn't the case. Owen: The suicide note described a way of killing himself which wasn't the way he killed himself. He said he didn't want to shoot himself so instead he was gonna take lemons, which is quaaludes. Well, there was no quaaludes in his body and he did shoot himself. The kid had problems. He tried to commit suicide a week prior to that with pills. Other people say that, you know, Caruso being such a conniving scumbag basically used that as cover to set up this fake suicide attempt. Brafman: And all I did was begin going through that evidence and confronting Caruso with one piece of evidence after the other. Brafman suggested that there was foul play, but absolutely not. And at one point in the middle of the cross, Caruso just broke down hysterically crying, "I didn't kill him. You have to believe me, I didn't kill him." Owen: Caruso, big old tough guy, suddenly burst into tears. Right? Blub blub blub blub blub. He imploded at that point where I think everybody in the jury sort of decided to move a little bit further back from the witness stand because he went from being maybe maybe maybe maybe, you know, a drug dealer liar, to maybe maybe maybe being a cold-blooded murderer. And that has a way of turning off jurors. The most significant thing about that trial is not who took the witness stand, it's who didn't take the witness stand. I remember at one point late in the trial saying to friedberg, "when are you gonna put germanowski and gagne on? What do they offer? They were in a club for two years, they saw six drug sales." The amount of dirt we had on those guys at that point, they probably would have needed an attorney of their own by the time Ben was finished with them. Owen: Gagne and germanowski, they were there every day in that trial. Did they take the witness stand? No. Ben brafman said it to me more than once, in his 35 years as a defense lawyer has never seen the case agents not testify. Brafman: And we had about 26 witnesses who we were gonna use in our defense case. But I kept watching that jury react to key government witnesses and I was seeing people like rolling their eyeballs when these people were testifying. And I was getting the impression that a couple of those people just didn't believe them. It was like the ecstasy bandits. It could have been a movie. But it had nothing to do with Peter Gatien. I said, "if we put on a defense case, we will lose this jury." Owen: Brafman was so confident that he had basically destroyed the prosecution, he didn't call a single defense witness. And I remember going home and laying in bed wide awake knowing that I was about to make a decision that would impact forever on the quality of life that Peter Gatien and his family might get to enjoy. And that if I was right I was gonna be a hero and it would be great. And if I was wrong I was gonna be second-guessed by every lawyer who Peter went to for the rest of his life who would look to say the guy blew it. You had 26 witnesses, what would be the downside? So we rested. This case, either we win or we lose on the issue of the credibility of the principal government witnesses. I remember looking at this jury who are all middle-aged people, normal people. I said, "let me ask you an honest question. If you were going on vacation would you give one of these guys the key to your apartment and let them water your plants? You wouldn't. Not only did they have a career of criminal conduct, but they came into this courtroom and they lied to you. So why should you trust them in deciding someone else's life?" And I said to the jury that my biggest concern in this case was what a lifeguard on a beach faces on a particularly rough day. You could be the best trained lifeguard and someone could be in the water a couple of hundred feet off of the shore and you should be able to run out and save them with little effort 'cause you know how to swim. And then the current hits. And I don't care how good you are, you can't save them. They drown. That's my fear in this case. But drugs has been the current that's been running through this courtroom. Peter is the guy who you should hold responsible for drugs in New York. That's the current. And if you allow Peter to be swept out and drown in that current, then you haven't done your job. 'Cause you swore that you would decide this case on the facts or the lack of facts, not on whether there were drugs in New York. The question is did he knowingly commit the crimes charged in this indictment? And if you find that there's a reasonable doubt as to that, then you have to find him not guilty. It's just an awful feeling. You totally have no control over the situation either. It's like your whole life is in the hands of these 12 people and you've got lying, cheating, get-Gatien-at-all-cost, no-integrity-whatsoever people wanting to destroy you and your family's life. And now you've got two years of work compressed into 90 seconds. When we stood up to accept the verdict he grabbed my hand and he was shaking more than I was. Any guilty here was bad for the home team. So until the whole verdict sheet was finished, you know, and we had a clean sweep of all not guilties, it wasn't over. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. And Peter's side would sigh, "yay." And the other side just went, "ah." But when the last not guilty was read, I mean, Peter let out a whoop. I'm elated. I feel like the weight of the world is off my shoulders. It's been a really difficult time for my family and myself. You don't know what winning the big one is when you're looking at 17 years in jail. I thought I was gonna have a stroke to be honest with you. Happiness, the gratification, all these emotions, the fear-- it all sort of hits you at one time. Brafman: What was really amazing is all of the club kids started to dance and scream and yell. And they were jumping on the benches. And the judge tried to gain control of the courtroom. You know, "I want the courtroom cleared." And then I think he finally, you know, gave up and walked off the bench recognizing that there's no way to contain this moment. Male reporter: The government lost big today. After two years it all came apart. After a month-long trial, jurors deliberated for five hours over two days. Much of the testimony they considered came from drug dealers that struck a deal with the prosecution. In the end it could have been the credibility of those witnesses that cost the government this very important case. I think it really speaks sadly of our justice system. Really, if you don't have funding, you don't have a prayer. I mean the government doesn't run out of money and it doesn't run out of time. And if they want you, and this prosecution wanted me, they do whatever they have to do to get you. Zachary Carter: This particular trial, not the entire prosecution or investigation, but this particular trial was about whether or not Peter Gatien was responsible and the jury has spoken on that issue. They could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he was personally responsible. The jury definitely saw that this was an abuse of power. Unfortunately it turned my life upside down and my family's life upside down and it's never been the same since. Manhattan club owner Peter Gatien was acquitted of charges that he turned his New York nightclubs into drug supermarkets to increase business. Gatien claimed that if there was any drug dealing in his club it must have happened on his left side. Male reporter: Gatien, just glad he's not the guilty one, walked out of court tonight ready to explode yet again into New York nightlife after a long and troubling ordeal. We got outside the courtroom. I said, "okay, Peter. What are we gonna do?" He said, "I'm going to church." I said, "what do you mean go to church?" He said, "let's go to the Limelight. Male reporter: New York is in for one grand party. That's the word of Peter Gatien's attorney tonight. And the Limelight will reopen he says in four weeks as one of New York's biggest nightclub owners celebrates his newfound freedom. Male reporter: And one of the biggest names in the nightclub business was charged with tax evasion-- Peter Gatien. Well, it was the end of the United States vs. Peter Gatien in the federal court. We then had the people of the state of New York in the tax case. Female reporter: It's the latest chapter in an ongoing battle between Gatien and the city. This evasion charge is a classic case of skimming from those cash receipts in a concerted effort executed over a five-year period to enrich these defendants at the expense of not only the taxing authorities, but the taxpayers of the city and state. Male reporter: Federal prosecutors claim he and his wife Alessandra owe nearly $1.5 million in back taxes. If they're convicted they'll go to jail for up to 25 years. Gatien: It went back five and a half years. I did $100 million plus in business over that five-year period. So we paid less than 1% of our staff in cash, and I was guilty. Peter had screwed up in terms of taxes. And we intended to work it out, and we did. Gatien: Here's the deal that he negotiated: Got to return the million one, got to pay a half million dollar fine; we will give you what's called a certificate of relief that will allow you to retain your liquor license; you'll go to jail for 60 days and probation for five years. So I did my 60 days. And I was delusional enough to think, "okay, they got their pound of flesh. Let me, you know, get back in and start life over and, you know, make a go of it." Female reporter: Club king Peter Gatien is calling on former city drug czar Robert silbering. Gatien says the former city drug prosecutor can help him keep his clubs drug-free. And I hired him probably about '99 to monitor the clubs at that point. I sit down with Peter and I said, "look, Peter, there's gonna be a lot of changes. Otherwise I'm out the door." Dabrowski: First of all, we fired all security. Got rid of all the managers. Got rid of everybody. Silbering: We're gonna scan their ids to make sure that they're appropriate age. Dabrowski: We started to put wristbands on people who aren't 21. Silbering: We're gonna have to put signs up which says no one will be admitted using drugs. Dabrowski: And we started to search people. Security: You all will be getting into tunnel. Just back up, please. You got to take your shoes off as you come in through the metal detectors. Any drugs found on you and you will be asked to exit the building immediately. Guys on the left, girls on the right. Before tunnel even opened the task force was down there. They had the roads blocked off. 100-200 policemen outside. You couldn't even get on the block without having your I.D. Scanned. It really did feel like you were trying to have a night out in a police state. We did everything we possibly could to have people take their shoes off, their socks off, open their mouths. The body searches at the front door were practically indecent now. When you start searching people and make them feel like they're entering a federal prison, it's not the atmosphere they want to pay to come into. I would not compromise on the searches. I said, "Peter, we're searching people." Dabrowski: Tunnel on sunday night was quite open wild. Patrons were 90% black. They weren't a drug-using crowd but they were a drinking crowd. Silbering: The precincts hated hip-hop nights. Hated them. Oh, they got nervous. What are we doing with all these African-Americans in a white area? Mercado: But of course it was black people coming through a Chelsea neighborhood that saw itself being hoity-toity. And a lot of these people took the subways so they were walking from 23rd and 8th or 26th and 8th through the neighborhood. Silbering: And the party would end and arguments would ensue. So now you have a fight. So there you'd have assaults. You'd have broke-in cars. You'd have-- once in a while you'd have a mugging. Female reporter: Just last week a 16-year-old boy was killed after a fight at the tunnel ended on the street. A couple months ago I called 9-1-1 because there was a girl drunk carrying a gun. People didn't want hip hop in Manhattan clubs because of its reputation for violence. Anyway, I was getting a lot of heat for that. And it was strictly a race issue. The precinct didn't want black folks coming down to that area of town. Peter was in a difficult spot. He needed money. He was desperate. He owed so many people money. He owed me money. He owed brafman money. Gatien: And then I was paying down the 1.6 million back taxes, both federal and state. Peter, I think, looked at it, "this is my moneymaker. This is what's gonna keep me going. I can't close on sunday." Had you been inhibited or prevented from playing hip hop in 1999, there was not much music left if you were going to be current. Dabrowski: I met with the commanding officer of the 10th precinct, which the tunnel was in. And he says to me, "I'm gonna have to explain this now when I go to compstat. My statistics are gonna be higher, there's gonna be more crimes, this and that. If he doesn't open sunday or he does a different type of event, he's not gonna have any problems with me." So I went to Peter and I said, "look, Peter. I'm gonna be very straight with you. If you run hip-hop nights and incidents continue to happen on the street, they're gonna close you down." And they did. Male reporter: The only people in line at the tunnel nightclub tonight will be cops. Hours before the big Friday night kicked in, dozens of officers moved in to close it down and lock it up. A move which some say could finally lock the owner, Peter Gatien, out of his nightclub career. Female reporter: A New York hotspot cooled down a little over the weekend. Last night cops took away the tunnel's liquor license under orders from the state liquor authority. The West Side nightclub has had a history of trouble with the law. Male reporter: A state judge ordered the lock back on the doors of the tunnel nightclub for the second weekend in a row. The club is going to stay closed until the judge decides that there's no more drug trafficking going on there. Club owner Peter Gatien says that he is losing a quarter of a million dollars in admissions and his attorneys argue that the club security is as tight as possible. Owen: So it got to a point where it's essentially a war of attrition. Gatien was being hit on all fronts. He was being hit every day by "the New York post." He was hit by the mayor's office. He was being hit by the community boards. I think eventually this took its toll and it essentially bankrupted him. Dabrowski: I don't know the exact date, but at 2:52 A.M. This man comes walking down the stairs and he says, "I just filed for bankruptcy for Limelight." And I says, "who the hell are you?" He said, "it's very simple. I'm an attorney." Blah blah blah, the premises is closed. He said, "take everything out of here that you can." And that's-- we walked away. It was done. Finished. Female reporter: And a piece of nightclub history has been sold. The Limelight went for more than $3 million yesterday. The new owners, flatiron entertainment, plan to use the space for an upscale disco. And basically all the proceeds went, you know, for back taxes, both federal and state. Financially, you know, I was digging a deeper hole. And emotionally I think the whole family had just-- it was time to get realistic and let's just lick our wounds and figure something else out. Brafman: It got so personal that at the end of the day I think the objective got lost. And if the objective was to convict Peter in federal court, they lost. If the objective was to put Peter out of business, they succeeded. But what have they accomplished other than putting 600 or 700 people out of jobs? It's like death by 1000 cuts, which it sort of was. They never let me peacefully run my businesses or run my life. But what the federal government did to him afterwards was even more offensive to me as a citizen. What happened really very simply was I received a call June of 2000 from Ben who told me they needed help. He was a bit panicked at the time. Peter went to his probation officer and he disappeared. Peter was never actually a citizen. He was a Canadian citizen. Under the law, if you are convicted of a felony, even a state felony, even a tax felony that has an element of fraud to it, you're technically deportable. Gatien: I'm freed at rikers and told unequivocally by an agent there that you do not qualify for deportation. And two years later or thereabouts somehow, you know, I'm now a candidate. This was the United States government not liking to lose. This was, "we didn't get Peter Gatien in court so let's get rid of him. We'll just deport him." I was legally in the united states for almost 30 years. I have three American citizen children. I have an American citizen wife. Didn't commit a violent crime. Haven't repeated a crime. Got a certificate of relief from the judge. For me to be deported for basically a sales tax violation, that's pretty incredible. He was basically banished from the United States, deprived of the right to live in the United States with his wife and children. That's a pretty strong penalty to pay for the crime they alleged that he committed. I mean if he wanted to come for his son's graduation, if he wanted to enter for his daughter's wedding, if he wanted to enter for any of these reasons, he cannot do that without specific permission to do so. He did apply for that not that long ago and they denied him that right. I had a better net worth when I left Canada at probably ages 23, 24 than I did when I returned, that's for sure. Ben had given me $500 when I left. And that's what I had on me. Koch: In "les miserables" there is inspector javert who pursues a mayor who was wrongly arrested and who escaped from a prison. I said, "Rudy, you are pursuing people like inspector javert with an intensity that's not acceptable." And he said, "who is inspector javert?" Brafman: Giuliani on balance was a good mayor in my opinion. I think he did a lot of good. I think he cleaned up a lot that had to be cleaned up in New York and made it in some respects safer. But Peter Gatien did not impact on the safety of New York. It's clear that the Giuliani administration did not see the benefits of clubs. Owen: Clubs used to be incubators of culture. Alig: Disco, punk, hip hop, house music, techno, electro, acid house-- all of these are genres of music that began in nightclubs. Without nightclubs would they exist? I don't know. Moby: Without the Limelight I'm sure I'd be making music, because I've been making music my whole life. And some of the bombastic music I make is definitely the product of spending way too much time in the Limelight in the late '80s, early '90s. And yeah, the Limelight birthed a lot of interesting culture. What culture do nightclubs birth these days? You know what I mean? There's no nightlife now. It's stand around and pose and act like you're fabulous. Yeah, you're drinking and you're getting drunk but you're not partying. Owen: I mean, the Limelight was a kind of a high-water Mark in terms of that kind of era of decadence. And once that crashed, I mean that whole idea crashed with it. And that really to me was the end of that period of New York nightlife. It wasn't about creativity anymore. It was about something else altogether. It was about consumerism. It was about conformity. Caruso: Now it's a bunch of small lounges, small clubs. No big club scene. No big party scene. If some tosser turned up in their lamborghini, you know, in a Brooks brother's suit flashing his black amex, they wouldn't even get in the front door. But they became the kind of new stars of clubland. It wasn't the freaks anymore. It was the wall street yuppies, the realtors. Gatien: New York's not the city it was 10 years ago as far as being an entertainment center that the world respects. It's not there anymore. Weinberg: New York has nightlife now. Is it better or worse? Who knows? But I think we're all a little bit less that people like Peter are thrown out of the United States for reasons such as that occurred here. Owen: Other than being a tax cheat, Peter Gatien didn't actually commit any crimes. It wasn't Peter Gatien who murdered angel melendez. It wasn't Peter Gatien who killed Damon burett. But he did end up paying a very high price for it. And I think that's important to remember, you know? Dabrowski: Peter's not a terrorist. Peter's a club person. Maybe he didn't pay all his taxes, but he gave the city what they were looking for. Peter really knew the difference between a good party and a bad one. By the time Peter's running those four joints, owning those four joints, he was one of the best guys that ever did it. Gatien: If you asked me when I was 20 years old I would have said, "are you kidding? I know everything." If you asked me at 25 I would have said, "jeez, I was naive when I was 20 but certainly not now." And if you asked me, you know, five years ago when I was 35, was I naive? I'd say, "yeah, I was probably somewhat naive, but I think I've-- I'm a little more realistic now." I would think if you ask me when I'm 50, were you naive and stupid at 40?
