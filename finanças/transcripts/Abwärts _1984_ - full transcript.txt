With the next signal it is 19 hours, 48 minutes and 30 seconds. OUT OF ORDER - Evening. - Good evening. Can I come along? Sure. - So it's finally fixed now? - Yes, more or less. Though with these things, you're never really done. At least you won't be out of a job. All done, Mister Gössmann. - I'll be off. Bye. - Goodbye. Thank you. What? I didn't say anything. Are you mad at me? It's really not my fault that the stuff was late. So what. You should have taken care of it. You should've stayed tough. Those guys do nothing unless you pressure them. - You ought to know that. - What's important is that it gets printed by Monday. And that it's good! Above all that it's good, right? And good it is. I even rearranged the last images. Now it's exactly on point. Top notch. It's the best thing I've done in a long time. - We. - What? Of course, we. You and I together. Obviously. Well... Did Meyers say anything? I was alone there. He should keep his nose out. He won't get stuff like this from the others, especially not Witt. That guy is a total loser, don't you think? - Do you have the keys? - I've got them. - That smells nice, is it new? - Yeah. Any plans tonight? - Hello. - Everything okay? No, why? Why not? You should have the control mechanism checked more often. Just a speck of dust and the whole thing goes out of control. Here, please sign. Tell it to the guys upstairs. You know how it is. Yeah, but anyway. Something could happen. It's not my headache. What time is it now? - Three minutes to eight. -19:57... Okay, thanks. I'll come back on Monday. - Alright. - Have a good weekend. I'll be here for most of it. - Take care. - You too. Come, don't chicken out. - Let's celebrate! - Not tonight. I'm really in a hurry. Come on... just one drink. It never stops there. Come. Down? What's this now? Nothing happens. Well then... - You have to keep it pressed. - Take it easy. We're stuck. No shit? Take those shades off. And don't start smoking here! You have to keep the button pressed! - Do you understand? - Hello? Do you hear me? - Hello? - Looks like you've got the wrong number. Comedian, eh? Let me try. Hello, can you hear me? Hello? Hello, do you hear me? We're stuck in number seven! Can you hear me? Hello? Unbelievable. This can't be true. Is he sleeping down there? Hey man, get a move on! Forget it. I think I told you not to smoke. Think you could restrain yourself while we're in here? Then get us out of here! What can I do about it? Forget it. Forget it, forget it... Do you have a better idea? It doesn't work, it's fucked. Sure. Everything's fucked. The state, society... Everything. Exactly. You mean the alarm isn't working? Gee, don't get overly excited because of him, of course it works! Why wouldn't it work? Yes, they're answering in time. They're not answering, something must be wrong! We're stuck, so what? It happens every day! It doesn't mean the whole system is broken! If that was the case, we wouldn't even have... - lights here, would we? - That's true. Everything's absolutely fucked here. Sure. I almost fell in. What do you mean by that? Well, fell in. The door opened, but no lift. Nothing. Fine, keep it to yourself. And then what? Ask him, he knows everything. They will notice that we're stuck. - Don't panic. - Yes, but when? Surely earlier than tomorrow morning, there are still people in the house. I can't take this much longer. Hello? Please come in! Listen! Hello? If you think it doesn't help, suggest something else. - I have time. - But I don't! I'm tired, I want to get home, I've had enough of this. You've made that quite clear. - Also that you want to go home alone.. - Really? I don't think this concerns you. Then leave it out of this! Stop talking about it all the time then. Hey... Don't worry. Actually, nothing can happen. I'm just so tired. And I hate being confined in small spaces with other people. Yes, I understand. Don't be afraid. Really. Afterwards you'll laugh about this. I was pretty lucky. I was able to hang on... at the last moment. There wouldn't have been much left of you. Stop it. Do you remember the story about this bookkeeper in the States? They found him in a lift shaft after 30 years. As skeleton. It was a big story back then. They managed to figure it all out. Isn't it fascinating? That after such a long time, they manage to establish whether it's murder or accident or suicide. - So? Was it murder? - I hardly doubt it. - He had a 100 grand in his pocket. - You're making up another one of your stories. This is an authentic case! The briefcase with the money was lying next to him. He was working for the mob. Maybe he was trying to trick them, who knows. So they iced him. And threw the money down the shaft? No. It wasn't murder, wasn't suicide... The guy had an accident. Just like you. Crazy, don't you think? Think about it, the poor bastard plans his big coup, minutely, really, in minute detail. He considers, cancels, hesitates... Then decides to do it... - and falls down the shaft! - Please cut it out, I don't want to hear this now. This sucks, man. I'm starting to don't find it funny anymore. This idiot must wake up eventually. That won't help. Shall I wait until we suffocate in here? Suffocate? - Is that possible? - Why not? Sure! It's all metal. Here. Not a gap. Right? What do you say? It's a coffin. One fifty and... two by two meters. Six cubic meters of air for four people. What does it make? Eh? He won't need that much. And if you stop blabbering, maybe we have a chance. Something's coming. It stopped right above us. They didn't notice. Nobody's getting in. It's coming down again. - Hello! Hello! - Hello! - Help! - Hello! Help! We are here! Hello! Help! Be quiet, be quiet! It must be down by now. Maybe they're answering. Why is nothing happen? My God, they passed right by us and... Why isn't anyone coming? Ask me something easier. Do you think everyone's gone home? How should I know? Why are you grin so stupidly? Think you're clever, eh? Listen, I'll tell you something. If nobody's here anymore, we're in deep shit. Better give a signal. Just bang on the walls, that's it. Here. Here. Are you not well? I'm fine. He's not bad. I can do this for hours. I don't want to be here for hours. Here. - How many points can you get? - Depends on how good you are. - I'm not that bad at pinball. - That's what my grandpa said too. - The first points come for free. - Ah, damn. I'm dead. You won't get it open. - Jesus, it's no use! - So, why not? - Maybe there's a door there. - That's a door right there. I mean a floor door! So what? You still can't open it. Have you tried? I can see it. -You see it. - Yes! Maybe there's a latch or something. Goddammit! There has to be an emergency exit. There's one in every lift. See? There it is. It's not, as you can see. Wait. - Just break it. - That's not necessary. - You didn't want to suffocate. - Come on, this is ridiculous. There's no reason for that. Yeah, just smash it. It only belong to others. Shortness of breath means fun of death. Doesn't look too good, does it? Take this. Get out of the away! Move! Come on, move! What are you looking for? - What do you think? - I'd like to know too. You'll see any minute. Nothing, huh? No. - We'll have to look for it up there. - It doesn't look good, though. We might as well destroy that one too. Watch out! Great. Stay up there and try if you can see how it's fastened. It's just simple screws. The file, please. - How does it look? - Dark. Can you give me your lighter? Be careful! You know how much they cost. That looks nasty. If nobody is going to notice, we'll have a long dark night. No need to tell her that, understand? She'll find out, she's not stupid. But she can make trouble. For you maybe. I find her interesting. Of course she's interesting. She's good-looking and she knows it. - And that's the problem. - And what else? What else? You want to know how she's in bed? Well? How is she? I heard about this guy, he worked for a freezing company. In Chicago. One day he got locked into a freezing wagon and was send to New York. And when they... When they opened it in New York, they found him. Sheets of paper from his notepad all around. He had described quite exactly... His handwriting was barely readable, he wrote everything in the dark, but he described in detail how the coldness slowly encroached on him. And it was clear to him that he would freeze to death. He believed in it and couldn't think of anything else. And there was also a letter to his wife. A sort of will. Then again another exact description of how he slowly lost feeling of his feet and hands... Well, and so on. Then it was just illegible scrawl, but the craziest thing about the whole thing was... What? Go on. Listen. It's coming back. Marion! A lift is coming back, bang the walls! - We try it from here. - Forget it. There's probably no one in it. You might be right. - If it's coming up here anyway. - Hello! - Help! - Hello! Help! - Hello! - Help! - Watch out! - Somebody? Hello! Hello! Hello! How do you know there's no one in it? Why would anyone go up at this hour? Why not? Marion, you have to yell louder, we hardly hear you! Look out, it's coming back! Hello! - Hello! - Help! - Hello! Hello! - Help! Hello! They didn't hear us. What are you doing? Leave that! You can't throw that there, you don't know what you'll break! They still didn't hear us! - We'll see about that soon. - Wanna bet? - It should be down now. - You can forget about it. What's going on? Did they hear us? Is anything happening on the screen? On the intercom? No. - Come here. - What? If I stand on your shoulders I should reach that. - Jesus, that's way too high. - It's worth a try. Well, and now? Just wait. Ouch, damn! - I can't do this without gloves! - Hard, isn't it? Told you so. - Fuck you. - It's over any minute. I've slid down ropes many times while mountain climbing. Sure. You're a hot shot. - You work here too, right? - Yes. It's pretty stuffy in here, you should take your coat off. Oh thanks... I'll be fine. And your briefcase? I know what's in there. Five kilograms of laundry. You wouldn't believe the telling-off I got in the laundromat, when I attempted to use the machine reserved for you. No, that's not possible. It's for the older gentleman from the tower building, he'll be here soon. Precisely at half eight. Every Friday evening. But today you won't make it. No, not anymore. You are very meticulous, aren't you? With everything. It shows. How you walked in there and went straight to your machine, not one sideways look. I don't think you noticed me there. What is it? Well, what's up? Doesn't look good. - What happened to your hands? - It's not bad. I'm fine. - Let me do it. - I don't think we'll get out that way. Do you mean that we have no option except to wait? Happy days are here again... The skies above are clear again... Strong boy. But he couldn't make it. We'll have to think something else up. - Is that good? - Thank you. Question is: what? Let's see what we have here. - Oh! The finest! - Are you crazy? - What's the matter? - That's my stuff! - So what? - What do you think you're doing? You can't just take it! Don't make a fuss. We're working our asses off for you, and you... Come on... - You want some? - No. - I'll buy it from you, okay? - It's not about that. I'm paying for it. Here. - Can you open this? - Sure. - I thought you didn't drink. - But I do! Not that simple, eh? Pull, boy, pull! What? Please. Oh, thank you. Well... Here's to us. - Sure you don't want any? - No. A Coke? - You got one? - Sure, we have everything. Robby only drinks Coke. You can spare us your remarks. Okay, okay. Maybe I'll just shut up. You're right to keep yourself out of this. Here. Thank you, I don't drink. Who is Robby? A friend. I have to go to bed earlier. You behave like shit. And what do you do? Anything that comes my way. Right now I work as a courier for Quick. - They are cutthroats. - Do you like it? I get a little money for it. - You don't need much, do you? - I never have enough. - Who does? - Same with me. I'm always broke at the end of the month. No wonder. I hate having to stretch every penny. I did that long enough. Oh please, you've never had a shitty job. When I started out, I made drawings for an ad agency. Totally stupid stuff, and for an incredibly low pay. That was pretty dire. Didn't we all start like that? But it's twice as hard for a woman. Especially with Meyers. That kind of support is always available. Now I can occasionally afford things. Now I can say NO. I just want to get away. Just leave all behind. Forget the whole shit - and lie in the sun. - Sure. And not care about anything and leave all the problems to others. Eyes shut and Walkman on, right? So what? Got a better offer? - Like a respectable job? - I understand you completely. Jesus, that's all on our expenses. But first you need a bunch of money. A little starting capital for a getaway. First a big thing, then up, up and away. Cut and run. Catch a plane and goodbye. You can't even get out of here. At least he tried. I don't bust my ass for others anymore. Is there really no chance up there? Leave it to the king here. Please stop that. Want one? Thanks. That beep really gets on my nerves. And the smoke gets on mine. Why? It goes in the shaft now. I wish you would too. Want to play? - What? - For who goes back up. You can't, with your hands in that shape. - Here. Three matches. - Jörg's right, you can't do it. As you wish. Ready? That's idiotic. - How many? - Four. Five. Show. How many? - Two. - Three. - Let's hear. ...Three. - Two. - Two. - One. How many? One. None. You wouldn't have made it anyway. Well then, let's go. I have to pee anyway. - You'll fail. - Aren't you going? That's not what we bet on. Thanks. Shit. He won't succeed. Would you? You can't get a grip up there. What's he supposed to do there then? He was getting on my nerves. Want to play? I don't know how. I'll show you. Remember what you have in your hand. This is too boring for me. Do you know this one? How do you get the middle one out of the middle without touching it? No. Don't touch it. Tell me. No. Whisper it. What's your name? Pit. You just wanted him out of here, Pit. Is something happened? Are you okay? He just wants to put you down, I can see it. He has his problems too. It's not your business, is it? We work together for almost the whole day and we sit in the same room. I pick stuff up. He gets worked up about every stupid little thing. - Everything. - I see. He also has difficulties with his work. It's all connected. They want him out. In some way I feel sorry for him. So you comfort him. He used to be very nice. But not anymore. That's how it's done. Not everything is that easy. You have someone? Used to have one. Others too. Him as well? Him as well. You're shivering. I'm scared. He's got his hands full. It's not that. And Robby? Does it bother you? No. Not here. My God, look at you. Can I help you? Did it at least work? Not as well... - Not as well as for you. - Is the door open? Yes... Two might manage it. Not alone. There's nothing to hold on to to get to the door. But you made it to the door? Yeah, I was close to it. It didn't sound like it though. I don't think you were listening. You don't think? No. You were just toddling up there. I was at the door... I had my hand... I don't give a fuck if you get out of here! Who am I to... Why should I risk my life for all of you? I don't need to get out of here! I don't need a bed to get laid! You're probably not getting laid much. Did she tell you that? Nonsense, I didn't say anything. I wouldn't put it past you. You're always playing little games. Unfortunately I didn't realize that earlier. Leave her alone. Even a blind man can see what's eating you. That's a door right there. For God's sake, there's a door here and he's just standing in front of it! A rope. We can get down with this. Come on, give me your hand. Prick. You goddamn asshole! - Why didn't you hold me? - Leave him alone! It's your fault! You got us in this mess! Hey. Hey you! Is something happened? Get up here. I guess, we need to hurry. Just don't let me fall this time. Alright. Help me, damn it! Okay. - How does it look? - Not good. - Pretty long way down. - With the rope I can get to the door. And how will you open the lock? That's my problem. Here. At least take a hammer and a screwdriver. I know what I'm doing, wise guy. That knot is going to tighten. You have no clue. It won't tighten. You'll see. Here. I'll let you down now. Better watch it. Wait a minute. Take the lighter, you might need it. Here. Slowly, slowly. You okay? Slowly, take it easy... Are you okay? My God, what happened? Jörg! Pit! What's going on? Jörg! What happened? Jörg! Say something! Come on, boy, let's... - Is he hurt? - No. No, everything's fine. Nothing happened. Marion, do you have a tissue or something? What is it? You bastard tried to kill me! Shit! Jörg! What's going on? Jérg! Pit! Jörg! Jörg! Please, stop it! Jörg! Jörg! You know you're through with her. You're insane. You're absolutely insane. You'll never make it with her. Never. Jörg! Stop it! Put that away or I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! It's my turn now! Look out! Pit! Jörg! Pit! Jörg! What happened? Where's Pit? He... lost... He lost his balance and... I don't know... He suddenly fell over. Fell over? You killed the boy. What? I heard how you said: I'll kill you. Yes, I heard it too. Marion, you... - You don't really believe that I... - What happened up there? He... He stumbled. - Stumbled? -Yes, he... He suddenly stumbled. He almost took me with him! But you hit him! Me him? He hit me. He went totally crazy! He probably had good reason. What exactly did he do to you? Oh my God... He kicked me... He kicked me in the balls, if you must know! You've been provoking him ever since he got in here. He tried to get us out of here! And you go and kill him! I didn't kill him. It was an accident! He lost his balance when the damn cable tore! But we heard you threatening him! You're mad! You're completely insane! Jealous, that's what he is! Jealous? Jealous because she kissed him? Oh no. No. I've nothing to do with you any longer. He might have succeeded. He couldn't manage anything! Nothing! Who took the initiative here? Did you? No! - He found the way out of here! - Not him. I'm talking about this guy. Why is he talking to me like this? I saw you throw him down the shaft. Oh, from here? From your little safe place in the corner? From here, yeah? You didn't see a thing. Not a thing! But I heard it quite clearly. And did you hear what happened before? How he threatened me with the screwdriver? No, of course you didn't hear that! You stand around here all the time, you say nothing, you do nothing! And now all of a sudden you're making the big speech here! You hit him and now he's lying down there! They're going to ask us how it happened! Yes? And what then? Go on, tell? What happened? Now I'm curious! I'll tell what I saw. I don't want any trouble. But you will get trouble! I'll show you trouble! Who does this guy think he is? What gives him the right to accuse me? We can't act like nothing happened. Nothing did happen, for Christ's sake! - It was an accident! - Jörg! You damn coward! No trouble! I think... I'm going crazy. He cashed in already. Looks like over half a million. 621 thousand. What are you doing with that much money? First a big thing. Jump on a plane and... up, up and away. What's going on now? What does it look like? Power's off. Now it's all over. Don't be silly. We're safe here. It's all my fault. This is the punishment. Over half a million. Oh boy, and you don't want any trouble. - That's really funny. - He will fire me. Maybe... Maybe he has already. Maybe all the others in the office already know... that Gössmann has finally... That Gössmann is finally done for. After nearly... 15 years. God, as if it were that easy. Take the money and run. I was 45 when I started to work for him. He was the only one who hired me. No other company was interested in a guy my age, who went bankrupt with his own little business. I was completely and utterly at his mercy. I had to be there all the time. Night after night, I used to work the books. But don't think that he ever paid me a single extra for overtime. On the contrary. "You are a little slow, Gössmann", he said. "I'm afraid hiring you was a mistake, Gössmann." And he was always threatening to throw me out. And what would I do... then? At my age? I'd been thinking about it for years. Planned it over and over. Every Friday, doing my laundry, walking back home in my empty apartment. Bam. Brilliant timing for the lift to break down. When you suddenly lose everything, people show their true face. My wife left me after my bankruptcy. You're nothing if you have no money. Just a petty accountant who has to beg and grovel. Every time I arrived with my briefcase, I had to listen to it: Well, Gössmann, did you bring your laundry? Sure you have enough change? And every Friday, just like the previous one, I'd stand there in front of the safe... but I couldn't do it. Why today? Today? Today a young man came to my office with a big box. Direct connection to success, he said. That'll bring you to the top. The accounting system of the future. It takes a load off your shoulders. You know what that means. I could never learn to use a computer. Not at my age. You're right. Quite right. When you're no use any longer, they trade you with a cold smile, for a machine, or... for one of these cool young types who can do everything better, who are faster, who have great ideas. And what happens to you, the big shots don't... give a shit. That's something you'll also have to come to terms with. What? That no one expects much of you anymore. You're run down, burnt out. You can't do anything on your own. I don't understand you. You do everything wrong. When people try to help you, you put them down. Marion, you... You don't honestly believe I threw that kid down the elevator shaft? You pushed him off. And now... Now he lies down there, and you two are sitting here complaining about your miserable situation. You had that coming. It's your own fault when they put you aside, when they want nothing to do with you. Because you... trample on everything, you destroy everything. You also spurned me back then. Tried to keep me small at work, just to play the big shot in bed. -You... - But you enjoyed it then, didn't you? I didn't know you well, Jörg. Now I do. A lot of times, I witnessed how you tried to eliminate others. You brag with work others have developed and were designed and conducted by me. That's all over now. Meyers already knows. He said it to my face. Easy, easy. Your time is up, Jörg. You're a nobody now. It doesn't happen that quickly. Yes, it does. That's how quickly it happens. He offered me your job. And I accepted. What's that? Can you give me a hand? No, don't! You'll only make it worse. Let's just stay still and maybe nothing will happen. Okay? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Hello? - Hello? - Hello! Can you hear me? Please hurry, we... I'll call maintenance! They will come immediately! My God! Pit! Come, take it easy. Be careful. I thought you fell... Leave him alone! I'll take care of this. Here, take my handkerchief. - I'm in the machine room. - Yes. Hurry up, there's an injured man here! I understand. I'll try to pull you up. Out. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hey, what's going on? You can't finish it! Clothes off, clothes on! They always call just when it's getting nice! You'll bang your brain out one day. There's nothing to fear. - Good evening. - Wait a second. I'll call back. Good evening. - Very polite. - So what's cooking, buddy? - Unfortunately not mine. - Excuse me? - You called us, right? - Yes, a lift cabin is stuck. I tried to pull it up with the motor, but it got stuck again. I think a short circuit... Thinking is bad! Real bad! - Where? - I don't know, I'm no electrician. No, I mean the lift. Where is the lift stuck? Come, Heinz, we better look for ourselves. Maybe in the express zone. - Who told him that? - Beneath the 20th floor. Yeah, this isn't working. That one neither. Good job, buddy! Wait! I acted exactly according to the regulations. And your regulations say: hands off. - How many people are in there? - Three or four. Very precise. - One of them is injured. - That's what we need. - Why injured? - I don't know. How long have they been in there? I just don't know. The alarm mechanism was off. Your colleague forgot it. Colleague, colleague... Colleague is coming any minute, huh? We need more light! Do the lamps work? Or did you forget those as well? Jesus, I hate those bloody Poles. - Too dumb to push a button. - Come on, forget it. We're almost ready. Tell them we'll get them out of there. Tell them to keep calm. Will do. But in good German! Hello. Do you hear? Yes, I hear you! It's about time! The repairmen are here. They'll pull you up now. Just stay calm. This will be over soon. Out. What's that? What has 164 teeth and guards a monster? - Don't know. - My zipper! Wait a minute. What's up? Give me a screwdriver. A big one. - Good enough? - Perfect. I don't like this at all. Come on, let's continue. Damn, who's braking there? Don't stop it. Forget it, Heinz! It's not working! Otto, the brakes! The brakes! Hel... - I'd like to know who caused this. - Probably the master Pole! Can I do something? Yeah, get lost! Stay here and calm them down! Tell them we'll get them out through the roof. Got it? And don't say anything else! Don't let them panic! Can... Can you help me a bit? If I tell my girl about this she'll never ride a lift again. Give me the keys. I bet that old guy did something. This never happens normally. They're coming out already. Careful man, this is no trampoline! Watch out! The injured first! Can you use this thing? - What's going on? - Come on, hurry up! No time for discussions! Go, go! - Can you manage? - Hurry up, man! Something's wrong up there. Come, slowly. Pull. Slowly. Ease it, ease! Okay. Slowly up. What about the guy in Chicago? What? The guy in the freezing wagon. Oh yeah. He died. But it turned out the refrigeration wasn't even on. You go first. The coat. - Let the seat down! - The briefcase. The briefcase is still inside. The briefcase. What are you doing? Leave that briefcase! It's not important now! Give me that. Step into this. You have to sit down. Pull up slowly. Slowly. Good. Very good. Okay, slowly up. Here. Your purse. What about this now? Well, it's all over now. Why? It's over half a million. Enough for two. Together we can make it. And what about her? By the time she comes to her senses, we'll be long gone. Hurry up, guys, you can talk later! Otto, come on! Next. Him first. - Pull him up. - Go, go. I'll see to that. Otto, hurry up! Heinz, it tears! What the fuck are you doing? Leave that fucking bag now! Move! Hold on, man! Hold on! Now! With both hands! Both! Pull! Pull him up, I hold it! Otto! Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Heinz! - I can't hold on any longer! - Otto! Hey, are you familiar with this building? Around the corner, then the lift on the right side. - The right side? - Yes, right. Ulrich, where to? Back there! Hey, you! Wait a minute! Hey, you! I've called you a cab. Excuse me.
