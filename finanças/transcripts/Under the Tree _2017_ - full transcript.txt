SupRip-Fixes-Sync VaVooM What are you doing? Nothing. - Are you watching porn? - No! What's going on? Is that you... and Rakel? No. Will you please explain what's going on Atli. - There's nothing going on. - Are you cheating on me? No, I'm not cheating. Is that Rakel? No. Well, yes. Yes. Oh, darling. Did we wake you? - Get out. - Out? Get out! Under the Tree Oh, it's you. What are you doing here? Oh, just some trouble back home. If you're staying here - you need to tell me. You startled me. - I was convinced it was your brother. - Right. Hey. Hi. So you're mowing the lawn? Oh, yeah. It's grown so tall... About that, uhm... Regarding the tree. It's not that it isn't beautiful, it's just... It's casting a big shadow onto our porch. Yes, right. Me and Inga have been discussing if we should trim it a bit. It's already been talked about for a while. Isn't it just a matter of... doing it? Right... We'll look into it. Alright then. - Hey, Atli. - Hi. So how's my little Asa doing? She's just, very busy. At the kindergarten. How about you? I just started my summer holiday. I'm off then. Are you leaving? - I don't want you to take the car. - Why not? It's your brother's car. Mom, Uggi always lent me his car. Could you go back inside? House Meeting Damn it. Agnes? Agnes, open up. What's going on? Open up, I know you're in there. Agnes, open the bloody door. Hi there. Hi. I think I'm locked out. Right... There, there. Are you hungry? I called the gardener. No one's touching that tree. We could trim it a little. It's a pretty big shadow on their porch. It was never a problem before he got divorced and Eybjorg moved in. Never. That cycling bitch can easily move out of the shade. Since she's so obsessed with her tan. At least she takes care of herself. Hello, it's Agnes. You know what to do. Thanks, bye. Agnes! Relax! Agnes! Agnes! Open up, please. Agnes! Can you stop? Can you pull over? Agnes, can you stop the car? Can we talk? Can we - Agnes. Please, I'm asking you... Can you stop and talk to me? What's wrong with you? Seriously. What's wrong with you? You don't answer the phone, messages... nothing. Atli, this is my work. Please leave. You've changed the lock. I can't even get my clothes. What's going on? We have a child together. You should have thought of that before you cheated on me. I didn't cheat on you. I've told you many times. Will you leave? This isn't the place to discuss this. Give me the key. Everyone's looking at us. Give me the key. No. Give me the key. Give me the key! Give me the key! Calm down! You relax! - I'm trying to talk to my wife! - Calm down, what's your problem? This is a workplace. I can't even see my daughter. Is that difficult? What? Looks like you're running away from something... Don't be scared of turning 40. Us girls all get older. I hope you have a permit for that dog. Yes, Inga. We have a permit. Have you had him wormed? He gets his shots. And we always keep him on a leash. Except when he's in our yard. And in my yard. I'm a bit tired of cleaning up after your dog. While you keep complaining about the tree in my yard. You can easily move out of the shade. And stop sending that loser Konrad to complain for you. I'm telling you, she's totally insane. I know. She's been unstable since their older boy disappeared. Disappeared? - Didn't he just kill himself? - No one knows. Very likely, but they never found the body. Do you think that justifies her behaviour? Of course not, my love. This is intolerable. And that tree... is coming down. - It's the fifteenth. - Oh yes. Of course. Goddamn it. What did she say? She just said, if we couldn't handle it, they would take care of it. She's making threats. Are you serious? They've really got some nerve, these people. We can't knock on their door and accuse them of slashing our tires. You could go and ask if they saw anything. See how they react. Goddamn it. Eybjorg. - Yes. - I'm sorry. I'm not sure if you saw that all of my tires are flat. - What? - Yes. It's as if someone slashed them last night. - Really? - Yes. You didn't notice anything? Maybe it was your wife? What do you mean by that? Just admit what you've done, you cow. Cow? And how about you, then? What's going on? They're accusing me of slashing their tires. We're just asking and she started insulting Inga. Who's insulting who? Do you really think I'd stoop so low as to slash your tires? This is ridiculous. It's because our tree is casting a shadow on your porch. Listen. Not everyone is crazy like you, slinging dog shit around. You can call me names if you like but don't touch my tree or my car tires. Are you really accusing her of slashing your tires? Have you lost your mind? The only thing we've asked is that you trim that tree because of the shadow on our porch. And don't call me a loser, Inga. Just because I've been understanding about that damn tree. Why was this never an issue before you got divorced and got a younger model? You're not worth saving. Neither you or your cycling bitch. What did you call her? You're not worth saving. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. Baldvin? That's me. I'm here to look at a tree. - That won't happen. - Why? No, you can leave. Hi. Aren't you Asa's dad? What? Yes. Hi! How are you? I've missed you so much. - What are you doing? - Building blocks. Building blocks? Wow, can you show me? - Hi there. - Hello. - Are you building this house? - Yes. It's really nice. - Who lives in this house? - Me, you and mom. Listen, we're going to go for a while. Oh? Do you want to go for a drive? We'll be back before four. Alright... Wait a minute. These things can be really sensitive. You know, people separating. Asa, can I see you on the swing? - Why? - Because I need to talk with Joel. It's Esra. Oh, alright then. Show me how high you can swing. I'll watch. Am I separating? That's what Agnes tells us. And since things are changing, she'll pick up Asa. And handle all communication, as primary custodian. So, I don't have custody? I'm her father, right? I don't know, it's really hard for us, getting caught in between. These are sensitive situations, you can understand that? No, I don't understand. Asa, come on, we're leaving. It's not appropriate to take her during school hours. We have a certain framework and it's important that it isn't disturbed. You know I'm her father. Yes, but we have to listen to the primary custodian. It's the rules. It's not up to us. You two should talk. - This is not ok! - Say goodbye to Joel. Bye. This is our spot. Thanks darling. Damn it. Honey, I need to talk on the phone. Just wait here. Hello. Where are you? - Us? - Yes. We're camping. Don't give me that attitude. I'm not giving you any attitude. Ok, I don't care. Just get back right now. I told that dude Joel we'd be back by four. You don't pull a child out of school, just like that. It doesn't work like that. Agnes, she's my child too. And what's this primary custodian crap? That's me. I don't have time for this bullshit. Daddy, do you remember when we went camping? It rained the whole time. When are you coming back home? Soon. Soon. 76... 77... 78... Daddy, you have 78 hairs in your nose. Really? - How many do you have? - None, only old men have nose hair. Only old men? Asa, show me how fast you can wrap everything up. Why? Because mom is waiting at school. - I don't want to go. - We're running really late. Please, sweetheart. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. - Are you ok? - We went camping. We went to IKEA. Am I not allowed to take my daughter for a drive? No, he's back. But I want to report this. What are you doing? - Come on, let mom and dad talk. - Asa, Asa darling. Nothing you can do? I have witnesses. He took her, without permission. Are you seriously calling the police? Here's Esra, he works at the kindergarten. He can explain. You called the police? We went to IKEA. I was going to be here by four, but we fell asleep. Can we talk? What's going on? The staff are telling me we're separating? In that case we should talk, about things like custody. Yeah, that's not yours to decide. Oh, not my decision. I see... It's not fair... I don't feel safe around you. Why should I trust you with Asa? - Trust me with... - You show up at work and abuse me. - Abuse you? - Yes. - What? - Yes, he's threatening. I'm threatening? That's it. Not even a teenager would go to all this trouble. Being so precise. What a load of bullshit. I'm going to talk to them. No, Konrad, don't do it. Don't give them the satisfaction. Should we just accept this? They'll just deny everything. It will only make us look like fools. It'll be alright. Don't you find this a little dramatic? Security cameras? Not given what's happened. A lot of people have them. Couldn't it just be some kid, fooling around with his new knife? They did it. I'm off to choir practice. - Did you feed the cat? - I haven't seen the cat for a while. - See you. - Bye. What's happening with you and Agnes? I don't know, to be honest. Only scumbags cheat. - I didn't cheat. - Just like the asshole next door. She's not taking the child away from you. Well, thanks for dinner. I want to see my Asa. I'll just call Agnes. Mom, don't do that. So, uhmm... I think we should start the meeting we have a lot on the agenda so let's get straight to it. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. Are you kidding me? What? He doesn't live here. Yes, well... - Yes? - Close the door honey. Yes. - There's coffee. - Yes, thanks. Yes, I think it's best we start. It's absolutely disgusting. It's been said time and time again. And nothing changes. Your noises echo around the building. We can hear every word. From one apartment to another, you know? And people are trying to sleep, she needs to rest. And and the language we hear. Echoing around the building, into our ears. No living being should ever hear such language. Never! Is someone being loud? Being loud? Absolutely. Finger up the ass. We've called the police. - You've called the police? - Yes. Oh, yes we have. Yeah, you can laugh. Ha, ha. Yes. You're rude! Yes! The situation has become serious. I agree with Engilbert, with what he's saying. It can't go on like this. We've had enough and we have to trust that this is the end of it! After this meeting this has to end! So now let's move on this issue is settled! And our next issue is the drainage. We have to put in new drainage and we have an offer for the job. RS contractors that will... Do you want one? The offer is under 2 million, which is a very good offer. Yes, it's very good. All inclusive. Isn't this your uncle's company that did the sewage? I can't see that the owner of the company is relevant. Can I ask you a question? Most of you know Atli? Or you've at least seen him in the corridor. If you look at him, really look at him what do you see? Did you know that he films himself having sex with other women? Then masturbates to the videos. Agnes. What are you saying? He films himself having sex and then masturbates watching it. Oh? Do you think that's normal? Sure. You think so? I just can't... I hadn't started masturbating. I think you and Atli... need to find a different... we're here to discuss the drainage. Hello? Where's Asa? Get out. Where's Asa? She stayed with my mom last night. And? - Did you have fun? - I went out with the girls. Did someone stay here? - Huh? - That's none of your business. I don't care what you do, but can you forgive me? I don't know. - You can't keep her away from me like this. - Right now, the answer's no. How about later? I don't know. I don't even know how I'll feel next week. Should we talk next week? You cheated on me, deal with it. How many times are we going to do this? I've never cheated and that video is from way before we met. I don't care whether you had your dick inside her now or then. You went behind my back, emotionally. - It had nothing to do with emotion. - Didn't it? No. I remember how you were at Palli and Elin's wedding rubbing against her like some horny chimp. I can't believe we're talking about this once again. Who knows if you were masturbating to that video the whole time. I wasn't. Was it the first time? Does she know about it? What did you do last night? Do you recognize these gnomes? No, I can't say that I do. Have you seen my cat? - Have I seen your cat? - Yes. No, is it missing? It has vanished. Oh, dear. Where's Eybjorg? Eybjorg went cycling. Are you also going to blame her because your cat is missing? There's nothing from when you go out and find the gnomes. - How can that be? - I don't know. Or maybe the cat just went for a long walk. - Like cats do. - It has never been away for this long. Then he pulls a chainsaw from his trunk. - A chainsaw? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes, I know what a chainsaw looks like. - Hello? - Atli Baldvinsson? Yes. My name is Vilhjalmur and I'm with the police in Reykjavik. Ok. I need you to come to the station. It's related to property damage at a kindergarten. You know what I mean? Yes. I guess so. Are you seriously staying here tonight? - Is that really necessary? - When they've started breaking in? Why did he have a chainsaw? I don't know. It doesn't mean he was going to cut down your tree. Maybe. Your back shouldn't have to suffer this. - I'll stay here tonight. - You? Yes, me. I'll stay in the tent if you help me find a good lawyer. - The police just called. - The police? Why, what for? - Agnes is pressing charges. - What for? I don't know. Maybe I went too far. What's happening, has everyone lost their mind? I thought you were going to reach an agreement. Like grown-ups. Hi, it's Rakel. I just got a really weird phone call. From Agnes. What were you thinking? I don't know. Has anyone seen it? Other than her. No. Really? Yes. Let me see it. - Is that in Barcelona? - Uh-huh. Oh, god. That's right. Why do you still have it? It was just on my computer. Atli, don't even try this, you obviously kept it. I love you. Give me a kiss. The ass. One kiss? What are you doing? Atli... Jesus Christ! Delete it. What if some idiot stole your computer? Then what? I'm the next Kim Kardashian. Have you been watching this regularly? No. Atli, you know there's nothing between us. I know that. What is it then? It's just, you know... something else. What? I was horny, alright? - Do I need to explain it any further? - No. - Am I guilty of something? - No. People delete things like this when they break up. I know. Want some coffee? You need to have a magistrate declare official custody. Alright. He'll try for a reconciliation and suggest a joint custody arrangement. If that leads to nothing, the magistrate will rule. And how long will it take? Weeks. Months. And in the meantime, you have no right to see Asa. - You take milk? - No thanks. How's your mom? She's always the same. And you? Just... You haven't dealt with it? And this recording, was made with her consent? I suppose so. - He kept it the whole time? - I guess so. I understand you're angry. When someone goes behind your back like that. Asa's interests are most important in this separation. What's best for her. Children have the right to love both of their parents. Even if the parents don't love each other any more. Wow! How nice. - Can I keep it? - Yes. - I'll make another for grandma. - She'd like that. This isn't just about that fucking video. - You shouldn't curse. - You're right. Sorry angel. We haven't been happy for awhile. I've felt like he's just... numb. As if he wasn't there. I tried to get him to do something about it. But nothing happened. Yes. I understand. Maybe it's an excuse, I don't know... the whole thing with Uggi has really affected us all. Especially Atli. Though he'd never show it. Are you going to go forward with those charges? Hi? Mom? Mom! Mom! She's missing. She will be back. I just wanted one more time to tell him how much I love him. That bitch knew exactly what she was doing. By making my cat disappear like that. Clever of her. It's Uggi's birthday. Let's cook a leg of lamb. His favourite. You have to stop it. You were always such a wimp. Constantly whining. Uggi was much tougher than you. Cheers Uggi dear and Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Uggi. Happy Birthday to you. He killed himself. Can you just please stop it. Can you? Dad? Step inside. Even though your mom has gone nuts we can always hide at the bottom of a bottle. It's difficult to admit my dear Atli but sometimes I wish Uggi had died in front of her. Then there wouldn't be this constant doubt. It's over. That's what I've been trying to tell her. She just doesn't want to face it. I've been trying to have him declared deceased. She won't hear of it. I met Agnes and Asa. Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you now. And? She's got a temper. Just like you. And I'm the wanker that cheated on her. She didn't say that. But you hurt her. I took pictures like that of me and your mother back in the days. Dad, really! Just never got them developed. They probably exist somewhere. Maybe I should dig them up? Stop it! One more. Askur... Askur. Come here boy. Come here... Come on. Askur! Askur! - This is Askur, right? - Yes. So you're Eybjorg Kristjansdottir? Yes. I'd like to take the corpse home with me. Yes. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. Have you seen our dog? We don't know where he is. - No, I haven't seen him. - Are you sure? - Am I sure? - Yes. - Inga? - Yes. Have you seen their dog? No. It's not here. But if it's found somewhere dead by a roadside you're most welcome to bury it under my tree. It's a good place to rest. - What did they say? - She just mouthed off. Fucking hell. I just wanted to wipe that smirk off her face. - Let's call the police. - And say what? Fucking hell! Relax, darling. Sorry. You're right. - Hi. - Hi. I have an application for custodial rights. - Request for joint custody. - Yeah, that. - When can I expect to hear something? - It's the summer holidays. Ok. And? Nothing happens in the meantime? No, it's summer holidays. - Askur. - Yes! Who does a thing like this? How crazy can you be? How evil? Is that Askur? Eybjorg had a nervous breakdown, when we found him on our doorstep. We just came from the doctor, we're trying to have a child. Do you think this is the end of it? This is not the end of it! What's going on around here? What is this? Don't listen to their bullshit. Having a baby at their age. I've never heard such bullshit. Did you have their dog stuffed? Where's our cat? Did you kill their dog and have it stuffed? At least they know where it is. What do you mean? Have you lost your mind? What do you think I mean? Do you always have to be so slow? I'm off to choir practice. Atli... this summer has been awful. And it hasn't been easy for Asa, either. We're not happy together. And maybe we've never been? Our relationship started one night in a bar. And it probably should have ended that same night. But it produced a little miracle, that kept us together. We're always arguing, in a constant tug-of-war; we've begun to hurt each other. Why are we acting this way? Instead of focusing on the most precious thing we have? What her grandfather says is absolutely right. A child has a right to love - and to be loved - by both parents. Even if the parents don't love each other anymore. You asked whether I could forgive you. Yes, Atli, I can forgive you. And I hope that you can forgive me, too. We've made many mistakes in our relationship. And we've both behaved like idiots these past few weeks. But we still have the chance to do one thing right. Let's separate right. For us, but first and foremost for Asa. What the hell are you doing? Have you gone crazy? You killed our dog! Atli! What? It's your fault. It was an accident. Admit it. It was you, who pushed me. You know better. You pushed me. Are you crazy? Get out. Have you gone insane?! Admit it! Get out! SupRip-Fixes-Sync VaVooM
