I see the land! YOU AM I A cap, here. - How much? - Ten litas. - It happened to you once already. - Someone punched you, son. Don't you die now. Nay, he is too young to die. - We're old, so we have to die. - No... No? We have to live yet? Now is the right time. - Not yet. - Not yet? Not while we're talkin'. Stop, you fool! Soon the last will be gone... Lots of empty homesteads around. Not bad, ay? But we wouldn't manage it. - Why not? - Not used to. C'mon, as if we couldn't. Look, he's gonna ride it. - What's he takin' out? - A bottle. - Aye, he is puttin' in a bottle. - For the mornin'-after. He's gonna drink it on his way. Won't you let us ride it to the girlies? Would you? See how angry he is, won't let us ride it. Mister architect! I thought you'd never come. Hi! So much younger! You're saying you came by this? So? Couldn't you get a normal transport? It's not about transport. It's about communication. Sort of "Hey, booby, where're you heading?" What's this? A generator. Underwater one. - What for? - To generate electricity. Pass this to Tomas. You look worried. Couldn't get your favourite. Drinking here or inside? I'll get the corkscrew! I wanted the paintings to mean nothing, to have nothing in them: No thought, no emotion, no subtext, and no any special form. I call them 'Still-lives for nobody'. - Sounds sad. - Such is life. But they are beautiful. I thought the power was off. Achance to dip in your propeller? The propeller? It needs running water. Too bad, water's standing here. Too bad. How are you getting on with designing? - Like shit. - Why's that? You know, the designer is confined to consulting on toilets today. It's the only thing the clients care about. Unfortunately, they worry little what happens after they flush. My dear architect, you are overstressed. You need some rest. I mean it! The house is big... He still lives here, you know. - Who? - Ex-you. How can you tell him from other exes? What about me? Come on, step inside. You wanna watch me do it? It's the days when I can get pregnant. But I'd never know if it's yours, my gardener's or this magic tub's. Death cures. DO NOT TOUCH MY PLANTS! - Any leeches around? - You deserve a couple. Pretty satisfied with the one I've got. Kristi, come here! - It's magic. - And you jibbed at coming. Cool, Dominyka! I'm numb! - Total chill-out... - Bring the bags in! Enough! Ana, give me a drink. - This one is fine. - Do you need salt? - Salt? - Yes, thank you. Are we moving? Finally. To joy - motto of life! That it would never end. Gabija, show us what you've got! No! Over here! Go and have a wash! No, no, no! Watch out, be careful! This will help you. Why do you keep calling me 'Do'? Do' is the character in my story. Yeah, Gabija told me you're a writer. - It's just for my friends. - And who is she? A pretty and melancholic girl. She and six men are on a lifeboat floating in an open sea... untill they reach a cliff. Are you saying I look like her? I am. But we've just met! What if I've just started with the story. I noticed you look alike. Could be a brother and a sister. Would you like to be our mummy? Oh, it's too tough without daddy. We'll find you someone. Dumbass. Are we leaving? Phew, I feel somewhat thirsty. Strange... Where are those beavers? How come I never see them? Strange... Materials 16, transportation, equipment, domestic supplies 6, the boat and the bicycle 5000, then 200 hours on the net, plus sketching and designing... Humility' A noble man refuses big to strengthen the little.' To strengthen the little. Help me. Jezus... are you preparing for the war? My brother did this - in the case of Universal catastrophe. You know, huges waves, vulcanos, Falling stones, earthquakes... - Are you serious? - Yes. - What are you doing? - I'm closing it. No, no, sweetheart, No way. Do you want us to stay Here forever or what? This door is so heavy. You have to feel that. Only for a few minutes. You better help me. You have to promise me, that we will be able to open it. Hello! Don't be afraid, girls, won't harm ya. We are blacksmiths, brought the grate. The masters asked to mend it. Listen, Dominyka... Exactly, I'm telling you! Please don't be mad at me. I didn't invite them either. Do you know what I mean? Where's Kristupas, now? I need a corkscrew! Kristupas is at the sauna. - Fuck, what's keeping them there? - I'll go check. It sucks! - Is this Dominyka's place? - I think so. I'm Neringa. - Egle. - Natalija. I remember seeing you somewhere. Where is Gabija? Rimulis, bring my bag! - And who are you? - Baron. - Baron? For real? - For real. - Living in a castle on the hill? - In a tree. Seems like you guys got pretty stoned. Hi! Awhole bunch of you here! It's great you showed up! I am leva. - How fortunate you're not a queen. - Excuse me? Never mind, Rimulis is trying to tune in. Rimulis the King, am I right, Baron? Quite right, Your Majesty. OK, let's party! How pretty! Let's party... You smokers. Remember that night in the club? What a gas! The bullies that crashed in... Look who's here... man! - How did you get here? - Rowed with canoe. I thought you've parachuted. Row, row to me, dear; say, say to me yes. They sent me to help. OK, bring more water, then. We are... - Baron. Is that your nick? - It's my name. Munchausen is his surname! He is my colleague... Good evening! - You must be Dominyka? - Yeah. I am Baron. Decided to come by, though not invited. Everybody did so. Sorry for intrusion, but we're all intruders here. It's the marsh folk's territory. Marsh folk's? They should be kind to you, though. I don't walk this forest alone. - Scared? - A bit. I prefer the forest. Trees, unlike people, would never say to you, What are you staring at? ' Did you know the trees radiate warmth? Feel anything? I'm not sure... I'll bring the water inside. You here! They want to congratulate you! They should ask me first, OK? - Really? - Really! Let's go aside. Who is that? Hello. Be careful! Dominyka! Common, throw her in! Move on, move on! Catch the cake! Happy birthday, Happy birthday, Dominyka, happy birthday to you! Sharp! Well, it should be. Try that now. - How's this one? - Not bad, ay. - Yes, good. - I told ya. Should have had it earlier. Pass me the vodka! What? Let the road raise no dust! - No fear, you've spilt enough already. - To the brim. Jesus, it's too much for one go. We can do everythin', you know: Sharpen, weld or hammer, anythin'. Don't pour him that much... Drink to the mistress, ya fool. We... leavin' then. Good bath to you! Good luck! - Let's draw more water... - It's sick! You pour again, again and again. Happy birthday. Thank you. It was fun. - Have you finished your story? - Nearly. Will you tell me? Sure, if you are interested. Deal. I've got you! Do you hear me or not? They all blow! Old ladies blow, children blow - each and all! You've been disappearing somewhere. Had a talk with trees? - It's for you. - For me? This picture means much to me. Sort of a blown-up balloon. Piglet's present for the Donkey, remember? Coal, more coal! - Coal! - Coal! Let's have a walk. I've never walked arm in arm in the forest. And elsewhere? Are you tired? My best birthday ever. I have to go now. So you didn't come with Neringa? All alone? I'll walk you back. I would see the New Year here, with you. New Year? I'll be waiting even if you won't come. Here? Here. Bye. Where did we stop? Oh, the rock. Well, they manage to climb it. On the top they find an oasis. Beautiful nature... juicy fruits, lucid springs... A real paradise, you know. Go on. After a while, the flood begins. They run through the valley, and face a steep rock again. On the top of it they find a new oasis. This time they aren't excited, but scared to be flooded over once again. And so it goes. The ocean comes up again. So they run, they climb, and reach a new oasis. Damn! It keeps on going. The ocean is constantly coming up. They rest in paradise and climb. Only three of them survive. Two men and a girl. The girl gets in with the younger, and the elder, who secretly loves her, forges ahead and keeps climbing alone. He should have reached the clouds and freeze by then, but the clouds are still high. Later they find the elder man's body lying on the rocks. No, first his diary, where he's put down his discovery: It's not the ocean that's coming up, but the very rock is sinking. In fact, it makes no difference, only postpones their death. ...you know, it's quite good. It's quite good to brush your teeth in the lake. Let's get going? It was great. Like in the good old days. Funny that people say, 'You can't come back to your past'. Ana, touch the flower. What for? Touch it! Gabija, Kristup, come here, And touch the flower! What's gonna happen? I am telling you to touch it. This one? That one. You am I, And I am you.
