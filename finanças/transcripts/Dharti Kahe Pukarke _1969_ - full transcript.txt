"The soil calls out." "The soil calls out." "You who love me, why are you sitting dejected?" "Everything I have belongs to the one who touches me lovingly." "The soil calls out." "The soil calls out." "This is something strange. It makes me laugh." "This is something strange. It makes me laugh." "The one for whom I mean everything is ashamed of my soil." "Come close to me, son." "Why do you have these useless misconceptions?" "Everything I have belongs to the one who touches me lovingly." "The soil calls out." "The soil calls out." "The soil calls out." Let's go for it! Shivu! My champ! Master. Shivu! Yes! Shivu! Uncle Ramlal! Uncle Ramlal, come home quickly. You have a mail from Kolkata. Aunt is crying badly. Letter. There's a letter, Shivu. In Kolkata. I wonder what happened in Kolkata? I'm going home. Come on. Brother. Sukhiya. Look at the loser. I'm doomed. We're ruined. Oh, my God! What happened, Parbatiya? What happened? We're doomed. We've got this letter from Kolkata. Shivu, how did it come to this? We have been ruined. What will be our fate, God? Brother. Brother. Sister, at least read what's written in the letter. There would nothing else but disastrous news in the letter. This indeed seems to be bad news, Brother. I had realised it beforehand. We're ruined. Brother Ganga. Shivram. Brother Ganga, what's the matter? How do I tell you, teacher? How do I tell you? We've got a letter. Letter. Let me see. What happened, teacher? Why are you laughing? Teacher! There is good news in the letter, Brother Ganga. Good news? What good news? Your brother Moti has become a lawyer. Brother. - He has stood first in the L.L.B exams. Really? Are you speaking the truth, teacher? Parbatiya, you heard that? Our Moti has become a lawyer. Teacher, just read it out. What has Moti written? What's the point in reading it now? I had told you to see what's written in the letter. Shut up! What's written in it? You couldn't even pass the second grade. Teacher, please read it out. No. No. Come here. Here. Sit here. Why are you guys crowding the place? You heard what the news is. Go home. Come on. Yes, teacher. Read it out. It's written that your brother Moti.. No, teacher. In English. In English. Let me hear what has my Moti written in English? Shivu, why are you standing there? Come here and hear this. Read it. Stood first in L.L.B. reaching day after. Moti. Great! You heard that. Our Moti has become a gentleman. He has become a gentleman. Here, Master. Give me the letter. Give me the letter. Shivu. Parbatiya, say something. I'm going nuts. Okay. Hang on. I'll just come. Let me go tell the entire village.. ..that my Moti has become a civilised man. He has become a lawyer. He has become a lawyer. Shivu, ask the teacher to wait for some more time. I won't let him go away without feeding him sweets. Give me the sweets, Sister-in-law. I'll sit. Shiv. - Yes, teacher? Why are you sneaking away? Nowhere. I'm not sneaking away. I'm right here. Now, you realise the importance of education. That's why I say that you guys come to school at night. But you guys don't listen to me. Teacher, that's right. But how do I tell you? I feel embarrassed to go to school. Embarrassed. Why do you feel embarrassed in studying? You silly boy. For instance. You got a letter which had good news. And you guys started crying. In this day and age, you can't even read a telegram. Here. Give it to me quickly, Sister-in-law. Here, teacher. Have some sweets. You are really naughty. Look, if you don't attend the school tonight.. Give it to me, Sister. I'll get water for teacher. No. I want to hear anymore rubbish. Not at all. Lord, we'll be ruined. If I lose this land as well.. So, what do I do? You think I have a well of money. He has a well of money. Repay the money within 15 days. - Yes. But Lord.. - Accountant. - Yes, Master. If he doesn't repay the entire amount within 15 days.. Give all his documents to Sunderlal. He'll get it dispatched to the lawyer. No. No, Lord. - Mr. Hari. My Moti has become.. I heard everything. I heard everything. Okay. When will I get the sweets? Mr. Hari, this has happened only because of your kindness. If you hadn't given me money on my land.. ..today Moti wouldn't have been a lawyer. Gangaram, Moti has always been a talented boy. Gangaram, he has made the entire village proud. He has made the entire village proud. Come. Sit. Sit. Not here, Brother. Sit beside me, Gangaram. Sit beside me. Gangaram, you're no less. No one does so much for one's step-brother. Isn't it, Sunderlal? -Everyone does it, Master. No. no. No one does it. Yes. No one does, Gangaram. No one does. Mr. Hari, this is all your blessing. I just have one more request. Just as you have been patient for all these days. Give me some more time. As soon Moti starts earning. I'll repay your entire loan little by little. You'll have to repay it. You keep quiet. We're discussing something important. I'm quiet, Master. So, Gangaram. - Yes, sir. You were talking about repaying the loan. As you know, I'm not greedy about money or wealth. I lend money to so many people when they need it. Some repay it. And some don't. Well, now you don't need to free the land. I've thought of giving that land to Moti just like that. What? - There has been something on my mind for quite a while. If you say, I'll tell you. Sure, Master. Gangaram, after all I'm father of a daughter. I'll have to take the initiative. If you are okay with it. I want to get my daughter Radha married to Moti. What? "Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud." "Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "Go there and pour down." "Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "I wonder how come I looked into his eyes." "I wonder how come I looked into his eyes." "I got smitten by an absolute idiot." "I got smitten and lost." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "Go there and pour down." "Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "His energy has got into my body." "His energy has got into my body." "He never asks me why I look bored." "I'm tired of trying to woo him." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "My drape explains to him to hold my hand." "My drape explains to him to hold my hand." "My drape explains him to embrace me." "I've given up trying to explain to him." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "Go there and pour down." "Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." "He is so stupid. He doesn't understand my love for him." Radha, I know you're angry. But I couldn't help it. You don't know.. ..the things that happened in my house. When you hear it.. - Shivu. - What? Have you ever thought why I meet you secretly? Why do I wait for you hours on end? I sure have. We're childhood friends. We've played together. I get sugarcane and guava for you. Hey! You're still angry. Look, Shiv. We've grown up. We shouldn't be meeting like this. I'll never come here. And you also don't call me. What's wrong with you, Radha? Why are you talking rubbish today? Radha. What is this? Shiva, have you ever thought that I'm a girl. What's there to think about? You're a girl. I'll get married. - But every girl gets married. I'll go to my in-laws' house. I'll go away from you. So what? I'll come to your in-laws' house to meet you. And then at times, you'll also come to you maternal house. You'll also get married. How can I get married? I'm still small. First, brother Moti will get married. Only then. You are indeed stupid. You'll never understand. Radha, listen. Radha, listen. She's such a silly and strange girl. She is getting sad fearing that we'll get separated. She says that you'll get married as well. Great, Moti. Well done, Moti. You're a champ.. What is this? What is this? You are drunk. Listen, Parbatiya. Everyone said it's great news.. ..when they heard about Moti. Get us some drinks. So, I drank as well. But why did you drink? What do you mean why? They said it's a happy occasion. You also drink some. And you drank it. - Yes. If you ever get drunk again, it will be either you or me. Is it? - Yes. Then I won't have drink. My queen. The queen of my heart. Brother. What happened, Sister-in-law? He has got drunk in trying to celebrate. My Moti has become a man of refinement. Brother. Brother, get up. Come on, have some food. What have some food? Have some food. Listen, Shivu.. - Yes. Shiv, here. Take this. Where the hell is it? Here. Take this. Go get a little drunk. Oh, my! What the hell are you saying? Just get back to your senses. Stop talking about my senses. It's such great news that you'll also get drunk upon hearing it. What the hell are you laughing for? Pour a pot of water on him. Brother. Brother, come. What the heck? You know what the news is? - Brother. Shall I tell what the news is? First, lie down. Then you can tell me. Yes. - lie down. - Yes, I'll lie down. Here you are. I've lied down. Now, shall I tell you what the news is? - Yes. My Moti is great. Well done, Great. My Moti has become so able. Parbatiya. Parbatiya. - What? Why are you getting annoyed? At least hear me out. You know what Mr. Hari upon hearing about Moti? He held my hand and said Gangaram.. ..you don't have repay the mortgage amount. I'll give the land to Moti just like that. What? - Yes. And you know what he said. He said, "Gangaram, get Moti married to.." "..my daughter Radha." Really. Is this true, Brother? This is not true for sure. He's blabbering away under the influence of the alcohol. No, Parbatiya. If you don't believe me, then sent Shivu to.. ..Mr. Hari and get it confirmed. Shiva, what is he saying. Is this true? Will Mr. Hari get his daughter married to Moti? Of course. Or do you think he'll get her married to Shivu. He hasn't passed even the second grade. Where are you off to? At least have your meal before you go. Gosh! What took you so long? I've calling you since so long? And you're walking as if you're out on a stroll. Of course. I haven't come to meet you. What? - I had told not to call me. Then why do you call me like this. What an attitude! Little do you know the good news I have for you. Go away. I don't want any good news. Listen. Listen. Leave me. -This is about your happiness. Now, we'll never get separated. Got it? You're getting married into my family. What? - Yes. My brother and your father have finalised everything. Now we'll always be together. You're getting married to brother Moti. Shivu. - What happened? You're so stupid. You're a numbskull. You'll never understand. You'll never understand. Radha. What's the matter, Radha? Why are you crying? You broke the news so happily. Hence I'm crying. It would be better if you had got.. ..some poison along with this good news. You're a man. And you can't understand something so simple. Then what do I do? How do I explain to you? You want me to rip my heart out. Or jump into the sea and drown. Tell me. What do I do? Radha. - I'm so fortunate that I met you. You're an idiot. Go away. Go away. Radha. - go away. I don't want to see you. Radha. - go away. I don't want to see you. Go away. Radha, I understood. I understood everything. Get up. It would've been so much better if you had explained to me earlier. Sister. Sister. So, Sukhi, you found Shivu. No, I didn't. I looked for him everywhere. I guess he has gone to Chandanpur. Chandanpur. - Yes. There's a play that going to be held there tonight. Will you also come, Sister? It will be a great play. To hell with your play. Listen. Oh, my God! Oh, God! Get up. What happened? - What happened! You're sleeping upon getting drunk. And he has gone away angry without having food. He's nowhere to be found. Sukhiya looked for him everywhere. But who went away? Who else. Shivu. Shiv. He hasn't returned yet. Hold on. Hold on. Oh! I'll go get him. Sukhiya, come with me. Parbatiya, don't worry. I'll go get him. Don't worry. He is dozing off drunk. He has thrown is brother out of the house. And he is asking me not to worry. What am I supposed to do? No, Radha. I've thought about it long and hard. It's too late. This marriage.. - Will not happen, Shiv. Never. I'll kill myself before this happens. No, Radha. No. Don't say that. Whatever happened is good for you. And then why don't you understand? I'm not worthy of you. Have you made this decision after thinking about it for so long? I can't help it, Radha. Everyone's happiness lies in this. The happiness of your father, and my brother and sister-in-law. And what about the fact I'll be ruined. You never gave it any thought. Don't say that, Radha. You know brother Moti has become a lawyer. You'll get married to brother Moti. And the villagers will address you as the lawyer's wife. And me. I haven't even passed the second grade. As if I've passed the tenth grade. I'm also not worthy of brother Moti. Your father's wealth will make you worthy of brother Moti. Enough. Let it be. Look, Shiv, I swear on God. Only you're my husband. Yes, and if I don't get you, I swear I'll kill myself. No, Radha. Radha. Radha, listen. Shiv. Look, there's Shivu. Shivu. Sukhi, who is she? I guess she is uncle Sunder's daughter. Bindiya. - Seems like her. What's the matter, Brother? What's the matter! I've been looking for you since so long. Shivu, that was Sunderlal's daughter, right? Yes. Yes, Brother. Yes, Brother. Okay. Not a problem. Now, I'll have two daughter-in-laws. Sunderlal is a rogue. But I have no choice. I can't see my Shiv sad either. Isn't it, Sukhiya?- Yes, Brother. Come on, let's go talk to Sunderlal today itself. No. No, Brother. Don't ever talk to uncle Sunder about this. Why? Why should I? Okay. I won't talk to him. Come on, let's go home. You left the house without having anything. And your sister-in-law hasn't had anything either. And I got drunk and when off to sleep. Let's go, Brother. Let's go home quickly. Come on. Sunderlal. Sunderlal, why are you turning away from me? Listen. I was looking for you. You were looking for me. How is that possible? Gangaram, you are you going to be Mr. Hari's relative. And.. - Will you keep blabbering away? Or are you going to hear me out as well? Go on. If you want, I also could be Mr. Hari's relative. How's that? Shall I tell you? I've another boy. So what? Come on. You're the father of a daughter, right? - Yes. Sunderlal, your daughter is now mature. Do you realise what's happening around you? They secretly meet at Lord Shiva's temple. What? - I have seen them. I never knew this. How would you know, Brother? They are the kids of today. Forget it. Tell me. Do you accept this proposal? Sure. Gangarao, I'm so fortunate.. ..that I'll be getting my daughter married into your family. And then the boy is also nice. And then, why wouldn't he? After all, he is your brother. So, doesn't that make you Mr. Hari's relative? Brother, I forget to tell you the important thing. Moti is coming from Kolkata tomorrow. Hence you'll have to come with us to the station. Sure. Why not, Brother? Oh, Brother.. Oh, my! Who are you? And why are you barging into my house? There is no one in the house. Go. Go. Help! Help! Someone help me. Oh, my! Why are you shouting for help? Just remove your veil and look. Oh, my God! Moti. You. - Yes, Sister-in-law. I got scared. I thought some officer had come into the house. My Moti. You look like just like a gentleman. And how do I look, Sister-in-law? Great. No more talking please. Sister-in-law, I'm really hungry. It's been so long since I've had food cooked by you. I'll cook something right away. Great. Go for it. Come. Come, Gangaram. What took you so long? Come, Moti. How is it going, you prankster? Mr. Hari, you've organised a party. You needn't have done so much. Why not? Moti is not like you or me. - That's true. We'll have food. Some song and dance. Master, there is a problem. The singer from Chandanpur has gone to some other village. Sunderlal, have you ever completed any task? Now what? Master, don't worry. Shivram also sings very well. Very well. Is it, your prankster? You sing as well. No. No, I won't sing. Why won't you? You roam around singing in the jungles every day. And today, you're refusing to sing. I'll make sure of that, Mr. Hari, He'll sing for sure. Shiv, tonight is a celebration. It's a happy occasion. Yes, Brother. I forgot that. Great. - Come. Come. Come, Gangaram. Radha, there is celebration in your house today. And you're sad. What happened? - Nothing, Aunt. Keep dancing! Bravo! Stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop! People, sit down. Now, Mr. Shivram will sing a song for you. Wow! Great! Listen. Listen to me. Quiet. Quiet. I forgot to tell you the important thing. The question is why is there a celebration at my master's house? Firstly, Mr. Moti, the brother of Gangarao. He's sitting right in front of you. He has returned from Kolkata after passing the L.L.B exams. Wow. Great! Great! And secondly, my master has decided.. ..that he'll get his only daughter Radha married to Mr. Moti. "That night of happiness is here." "Let there be a song." "Sing your heart out." "Sing your heart out." "That night of happiness is here." "Let there be a song." "Sing joyfully." "Let a thorn prick your feet." "Dance joyfully" "Today, I laugh so much that I start shedding tears." "Today, I laugh so much that I start shedding tears." "Today, I sing so much I get emotional." "Let this song play till morning joyfully and with gaiety." "Dance joyfully." "That night of happiness is here." "Let there be a song." "Sing joyfully." "I'm the dirt. And she's the pleasant breeze." "Why does she want my company?" "I'm the dirt. And she's the pleasant breeze." "Why does she want my company?" "She shouldn't hold someone else's hands. And not my hands." "Let the bride get decked up with tears in her eyes." "Dance joyfully." "That night of happiness is here." "Let there be a song." "Sing joyfully." "Let a thorn prick your feet." "Dance joyfully." "Sing joyfully." "Dance joyfully." Shiv. - Yes. Are you asleep? No. I got such nice clothes for you. Why didn't you wear them today? I'll wear them, Brother. I'll wear them for sure when there is some happy occasion. Shiv, you sing so well. It was a happy occasion. That's why I sang a bit well today. No, Shiv. This is not happy occasion. This is not possible. What's not possible? Shiv, look you'll have to do me a favour. What is it, Brother Moti? Ah.. Nothing. Go back to sleep. Nothing. What does that mean? I'll have to do something. Shiv. Shiv, I .. ..can't marry Radha. Why? Has anyone said anything to you? What do you mean? I mean why can't you.. ..marry Radha, Brother Moti? Shiv, it's not about Radha. I can't marry anyone. Why? - How do I tell you? I.. I mean.. .. I'm already married. Brother Moti. Really. Really, Brother Moti. You won't be marrying Radha? How can I? You idiot. Brother Moti. Oh, no. Oh, my God! What have you done this? What if sister-in-law will know then? That's the problem. I thought I'll convince brother and sister-in-law. But brother did everything wrong. What? Brother did? Don't you shame. What's going on? - Brother. Shameless.. Of course. Parbatiya, I'll go around naked. But I will not wear clothes given by this shameless guy. Nor will I. Shut up. You are already prancing around in them. And look at that moron. He has worn trousers and thinks that he is some officer. Brother. - What? Brother Moti has made a mistake. Forgive brother Moti. Shut up. He is out to defend the lawyer. I've come across many lawyers like him. He has become a lawyer. But does that mean he will go against me? What say, Parbatiya? Yes. - What? No. - Yes. Go fall at brother's feet. Trust me everything will be fine. But.. - No ifs and buts. Come on, go. I say go. Brother, I made a mistake. Forgive me. When you know the entire thing.. How is daughter-in-law? Sorry. - How is daughter-in-law? Sister-in-law is very nice. You shut up. Did I ask you? Parbatiya, this rat knew everything. No. No, Sister-in-law. I knew nothing of this. Believe me. Brother Moti told me everything last night. What? What did he tell you? That sister-in-law is very nice. She's Mr. Mahendra's daughter. What? - Whose daughter is she? She's Mr. Mahendra's daughter. Yes. and she is a graduate in B.A. What? - Graduate in B.A. Why are you saying it softly? Say it loudly. Parbatiya, didn't I tell you that Moti won't marry any girl. Of course. What's daughter-in-law's name? Rekha. - That's a very nice name. Parbatiya, hold the hookah. Let me go tell my fellow villagers.. ..that my Moti has become not just a lawyer.. ..but he has also got married to a girl who is a graduate in B.A. But Parbatiya, when Mr. Hari gets to hear this.. Is he going to kill us? We'll get the daughter-in-law we want. No, Sister-in-law. Radha will also be the daughter-in-law of this family. What? - Yes, Brother. Radha will come into this family as Shiv's wife. No ways. Shiv's marriage has been finalised. With Sunderlal's daughter Bindiya. I've promised Sunderlal. But Brother, I told you. - Shut up. You think I'll do things as per your wish. All this won't do in my house. You have an affair with someone else. And you marry someone else. Brother, you're mistaken. What? I'm mistaken. You mean I make mistake. Bother, you believed Sukhiya and fixed his wedding with Bindiya. And actually, it wasn't Bindiya. What? - Yes, Brother. The one you saw at the Shiv's temple wasn't Bindiya, but Radha. Radha. - Yes. Parbatiya, what the hell is going on? Now, I understood why were so sad while singing yesterday. Okay. Not a problem. I'll go explain to Mr. Hari. And I'll fix Shiv's wedding with Radha. But what is Mr. Hari refuses.. ..from getting Radha married to Shiv? Why would be refuse? Our Shiv is no ordinary boy. Got it? I understood everything. But only if Mr, Hari would understand. Then go explain to him. But why are you screaming? Listen, let me tell you. I can't see my Shiv sad. As if I can. Moti, you heard your sister-in-law? Have some patience. Then I'll go and explain to Mr. Hari. I agreed for the sake of this rat. Don't look at me like that. I agreed for the sake of this rat's happiness. Otherwise, you think I would've agreed.. ..to get that lousy bandicoot's daughter married into my family. Never. Master. Master, look, after all what I said turned out to be true. What are you talking about, Sunderlal? Marriages should happen only among equals. You were out to get your daughter.. ..married into a low caste family. And you've fallen flat on your face. Master, Motilal is already married. Sunderlal, are you out of your mind? What nonsense is this early in the morning? Master, this is no nonsense. This is true, I heard it. This is the discussion going on in Gangaram's house. What discussion? That Moti got married in Kolkata. She is a graduate in B.A. not with any ordinary girl. The entire village knows I'm getting Radha married to Moti. Now, what will be Radha's fate? Don't worry, Master. Shivram's there. Sunderlal. - Master, this is not my decision. This is their decision. So, they've made the decision as well. - Yes. Sunderlal, no one in the village should come to know of this. Otherwise, I'll lose face. Moti has married a girl who is a graduate in B.A. Gangaram. Disgusting. Hey! Hey! - What is it, sir? Could you take me to Nandanpur? - Nandanpur. Whose house do you want to go to? Mr. Gangaram. - Gangaram. Yes. To his house. Are you by any chance Moti's father-in-law? Yes. So, you know Mr. Moti? Sir, sure I do. He is my cousin brother. What? - Yes. Give me your bags. And sit here comfortable. I'll harness the bulls to the cart. Come on. Come on. Come on. Brother. Brother, rest up for a while. Give this to me. What? - The plough. What are you saying? What will anyone who sees you say? What will he say? After all, I'm son of a farmer. You mustn't forget your roots. Give it to me. Go from here. What if someone comes? No one's going to come. Give it me. You won't relent. You're an educated man. You'll get me embarrassed. You're an educated man. You'll get me embarrassed. What's happening, Mr. Moti? I'm done for. Look, what I feared has happened. That lousy teacher is coming this way. Go rush to him. Go. Leave it. Leave. Hello, Mr. Mahesh. Hello. What was going on? Nothing. I told brother to rest for a while. And that I would plough the field. But he is not listening. - Why? He is scared. What if someone sees me? What will he say? Now, you tell me, Mr. Mahesh. I'm a farmer's son. What's wrong if I plough the field? What are you looking at? Mr. Moti, if you indeed plough the fields for a while.. ..I would get all the farmers of this village.. ..and show them that a well-educated person.. ..is not shy of ploughing the fields. I understand your pain, Mr. Mahesh. That's no big deal. Go call everyone. As it is, I'm ploughing the field. Gangaram! Gangaram! Coming, Accountant. Hello, teacher. - Hello. Hello, Mr. Moti. - Hello. What's the matter, Accountant? Sir has sent for you. Now. - Yes. I'm dead. Accountant, you go ahead. I'm coming. Okay. What's the matter, Brother Ganga? Don't ask me. Ask him. I had fixed his marriage with Mr. Hari's daughter. And this idiot had already got married in Kolkata. This is a grave problem. That's no cause for concern. There's another boy in your family. That's what I've thought of, teacher. I wonder what's going to happen. Hello, Mr. Hari. Gangaram, the times have really changed so much. Yes. You're right, Mr. Hari. For instance, you people wouldn't.. ..dare to sit in front of me in my house before. Yes? - No, No, I was just saying it. Sit. Sit down. Mr, Hari, I've something important to tell you. I'll listen to what you have to say for sure, Gangaram. You people might even have to leave the village. I'm not going. But the task I've called you here.. ..for is more important, Gangaram. Tell me, master. What is it? Okay. Gangaram, we are not landlords anymore.. ..that we keep giving you people charity. That's why it would be better if you repay the money.. ..I lent to make your brother a lawyer as soon as possible. Because right now, I need money very badly. Mr. Hari, I did not get you. Why? Your brother has become a lawyer. He has got married to a girl who is a graduate in B.A. So, have you forgotten the ways of the village? But Mr. Hari, you had said.. Forget it, Gangaram. The times have changed. Now, a man can't have two wives. No. No, master. That's not the case. There's another boy in my family. If you don't mind, Shivram.. Gangaram, come down to earth. What do you think you are? I just talked to you courteously. And you think you can get on top of me. No, Mr. Hari. That's not the case. That's precisely the case. Otherwise, how dare you want to make Hari Shankar's daughter.. ..the wife of your brother who is a vagabond, a loafer, a tramp? Mr. Hari, agreed that Shiv is illiterate. But he is not a vagabond or a loafer or a tramp. You wanted this marriage to happen. And you had taken the initiative. You have given us the money for sure. But I have mortgaged my land for that. As if you have done a favour on me. Repay the mortgage amount within three months. Otherwise, I'll be compelled to move court. Three months. - Yes, three months. You feel now that your brother has become a lawyer.. ..he owns the world. Can't he repay Rs.50000? But Mr. Hari, three months.. Yes, three months. Not even a day more. You two-bit farmer. And you dare to come and discuss things with me. Get out. What are you looking at? Get out. Get out of here. Okay, Mr. Hari. Very well. Oh... Yes! Sir, look over there. Moti is right there. He is ploughing the fields. He is ploughing the fields. Wait. I'll call him. Moti, look, your father-in-law is here. Father-in-law. Daddy, you. What brings you here? Yes, I had to come. We hadn't heard from you for seven days. But I see that you're quite busy here. Yes, Daddy. That's my own land. That's my own land. - I see. Come, Mr. Mahesh. Daddy, this is Mr. Mahesh. He is a social worker. And he is trying really hard to get the adults of our village educated. Mr. Mahesh, my father-in-law. Hello. - By the way, Moti.. Mr. Moti, I'll go now. Whatever, sir. It's our good fortune that we have a relative like you. Isn't it, Brother Ganga? It's all because of Moti, Brother. Only because of Moti. Uncle Ganga, I couldn't find Shiv anywhere. I've looked everywhere. He's a shameless fellow. Sir, my younger brother is very naughty. Very naughty. He has grown up, but he acts childish. He acts childish, sir. Now, look, he's just five or six years younger to me.. ..but he still calls me by my name. Come, son. He's my son. I think I should leave now. The train will arrive soon. Sir, have something.. - Listen. Sir, your elder daughter says.. - What? Moti's sister-in-law. She says, "We couldn't be hospitable enough to you." If you could stay for a day.. - Oh, no. It's just impossible. What is that, sir? I mean there's a big case coming up in court the day after. Otherwise, would I come running to take Moti along? After all, he has come to meet his brother, sister-in-law.. ..and relatives after so many days. I think Moti must be ready. Moti! Sir, your elder daughter says.. ..that it would be great if you could send.. ..our sister-in-law here when you get to Kolkata. Because nobody here has seen her. Yes, sir. Why not? After all, this is her in-laws' house. She'll come here and look at everything herself. Oh, you're ready? Yes, Daddy. Sister-in-law, I'm leaving. As soon as you get there, send sister-in-law here. Sister-in-law, I couldn't meet Shiv. Poor guy would be very sad. Come on, don't delay any further. Parbatiya, where are my shoes? No. No. Why do you take the trouble? Sir, it's no trouble. Sukhiya. - Yes. - Is the cart ready? The bulls have been harnessed long ago. My bullock-cart would be honoured today. Give me. Give me that. Come on. Did you bring my shoes? Well, forget it. Moti, go on. Go on. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Moti's father-in-law had came? - Yes he had came and gone. Yes, fool where were you? Guest was here and you are not here. You know, Moti was very upset while going. What? Moti brother also gone? Really? - Mahendar was came to take him. Moti brother. He gone without meet me. When he gone? Before too much time. Your brother also gone station. Station? - Yes. Hey Shive, listen. Listen where are you going? I am going! Brother, are they gone? - Yes. Where were you? Do you know how much I had search you. Brother that.. - Yes. Something went wrong. - What? Hari babu had called today. He has got all information about Moti. How is that? That becuase of cunning Sundarlal. And when I talked your marriage with Radha.. ..then you know what did he said. Finally he said. Give your all money in three month.. Otherwise hand over you land. All these things I couldn't talk to Moti. But what is in that for worry? We will see whatever will happen. What? We will see? Shiva all this happening because of you. Moti has married. And you are enjoying with Radha. And all trouble is my head. Radha! Radha! Listen! No, no, no! I won't say yes ever. You said such good news at midnight. "Radha, I am going to Calcutta." Radha. - Yes! Why are you shouting? Tell me one thing. Why is your objection that I am going to Calcutta? Look, Radha. It was tough to persuade brother and sister-in-law. And you're acting like a thorn in the feet. What? Yes. I'm like a thorn. I'm right before you. Strangle me first and then you can go wherever you want to. Oh, no! You make a mountain out of a molehill. Why don't you understand? Look, Radha. We have to pay your father to get back our land. I swear, Radha. I'll go to Kolkata, take the money from brother Moti.. ..and come back immediately. If you go to Kolkata, you'll never come back. Why not? That's great. I'm not going to do farming in Kolkata. I'll just go there and come back. But they will not allow you to come back. - Who? Brother Moti? Then who? Sister-in-law? Then who in Kolkata will stop me? They stay over there. - They who? Witches! They cast a spell on people. And they get trapped. Vishwanath's son Shankar went there. Did he return? He got trapped over there. That's it? Such a trivial matter? All right then. I won't look at any girl. You won't, but they will. One look into their eyes and you'll be under their spell. Don't worry. I'll not look into their eyes. Do you swear by me? - I swear by you. Don't touch me. Rekha! Rekha? What foolishness is this? Listen to me. I see. So, you were laughing? And I thought you were.. - Crying. Right? But why should I cry? Because you went to meet your brother and sister-in-law? And once you got there, you forgot me? I shouldn't cry over it, I should get annoyed. I won't talk to you. Rekha, you're not aware that I was in big trouble. When I got there, I found out that brother had fixed my marriage. Really? - Yes. On my way there, all I could think of was how to convince brother. But when I got there, I had a bigger problem at hand. You don't know my brother and sister-in-law. They scolded me about it. - And then? Then? Then what? He got red with anger and said.. "Leave that girl and get married again." Oh, really? - Yes. Well, the girl was also beautiful. And I thought since brother is insisting, I should marry her. So, I got married. You ungrateful man. - Why? Couldn't you even send me an invite? Do you think this is a joke? I'm telling the truth, Rekha. If you don't believe me.. - Wait. Wait. The one who was scared to get married the first time.. ..will marry a second time? Had I not persuaded daddy.. ..you'd have run away before the wedding. Listen, Rekha. Listen to me. I won't talk to you. I'm not asking you to talk to me. I'm just asking you to come closer. Mister Mister, where does Mr. Moti live? Idiot. - What? Do I look like a man? Oh, God! Hey! Salute, sir. - Where are you going? Brother Moti lives here, right? - Who is this Moti? Mr. Moti. The lawyer. He's a renowned lawyer. Yes, he lives here. But you can't meet him right now. Why can't I meet him? I'm his younger brother Shiv. Younger brother? Get lost. Why are you pushing me? Don't touch me! I warn you! Why are you holding me? What is it? - He says he's Mr. Moti's younger brother. Are you Mr. Moti's younger brother? - Yes. Hello, Uncle. Uncle, my name is Shiv. You don't recognise me because you didn't meet me. I see. Please come. Come on. - Okay. What is it? Your younger brother has come from the village. My younger brother? What are you saying? - Yes. I've seated him in the staff quarters. Okay. Shiv. Brother Moti! - Shiv. Brother Moti. - How did you come here? Who did you come with? I came alone. Can't I come on my own? No, that's not the issue. But why did you come so suddenly without informing me? What do I say, Brother Moti? You came away in a hurry and brother couldn't tell you. Radha's father Mr. Hari turned out to be chameleon. He changed his colour. He told us that if we don't repay his loan he'd seize our land. That's why brother sent me to you. Yes. To bring the money. I see. Well, don't worry. You'll get the money. But why do you look so pale? Have you eaten anything? No, Brother Moti. I'm famished. I had to make a lot of enquires to get here. Your father-in-law has a luxurious house. Your father-in-law is also a nice person. Father-in-law? - Yes. When did you meet my father-in-law? You weren't there when he returned from the village. So what? I just met him. He seated me here. He is wearing such wonderful clothes. And his turban is great. Turban? - Yes. What? What happened? Nothing. Idiot, he's not my father-in-law. He's Shambhu, my father-in-law's servant. Servant? - Yes. If your father-in-law's servant wears such wonderful clothes.. ..then what kind of clothes your father-in-law must be having? Okay, fine. Sit here. I'll get food for you. No, Brother. I'll eat later. Let me meet sister-in-law first. I want to meet sister-in-law. I want to take here back. Elder sister-in-law said so. Come on. - Listen. - Yes. Listen. - Yes. Look, do one thing. Sit here. I'll bring Rekha here. - Okay. This is great. You're in a ceremonial dress. Rekha? She's here. Rekha, meet Mr. Johnson. - Hello. Happy birthday to you. And please accept this from me. And he's Mr. Sarkar. My daughter Rekha. Hello. - Where's your son-in-law? Oh, Moti? - Yes. Moti. He's here. - Hello, Moti. How are you? Are you keeping well? - Yes. I'm sure he'll take your place one of these days. That's my ambition. - Very good. - Come on. Please come. Hello. Listen, Rekha. Excuse me. What is it? - Come with me. I want to show you something. What? - Just come. Come on. Shiv. This is your sister-in-law. My younger brother. Oh, my God! Sister-in-law, you're really beautiful. I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you. What are you looking at? Come on. Pack your things. I've come to take you. Shiv, be seated. Rekha, did you see him? - Did you call me to show this? Don't feel bad, Rekha. Shiv has come from the village. He doesn't know the ways of our society. But he is pure at heart. He's very hungry. Please bring some food for him. Why don't you do that? There comes Rekha. What's this Rekha? Will you play hide-n-seek on this day as well? Yes, Rekha. This is too much. We must celebrate. - No, please. Yes. Come on. Come on. - Stop being stubborn. Come to the piano. Ladies and gentlemen, please be quiet. Ms. Rekha will oblige us with a song. Give her a hand, folks. Brother, did sister-in-law get angry? No, Shiv. Why would she get angry? Shiv, the problem is that your sister-in-law is from the city. She doesn't know the ways of our village. As it is, Shiv, you shouldn't have sat in that chair. Well, forget it. Sit here. I'll be right back. And listen. - Yes? Don't wonder around. Okay? "Love has been kindled." "Let's be happy about it." "After many years of waiting.." "..this evening has arrived in our lives." "Love has been kindled." "Let's be happy about it." "After many years of waiting.." "..this evening has arrived in our lives." "Our bodies and souls have become one." "As if fragrance in spring." "Our bodies and souls have become one." "As if fragrance in spring." "The past, like the moonlight.." "..is shining bright on our faces." "Let's wander into some beautiful memory." "After many years of waiting.." "..this evening has arrived in our lives." "Love has been kindled." "Let's be happy about it." "After many years of waiting.." "..this evening has arrived in our lives." "The eyes twinkled." "Trapped under the eyelids.." "..are many beautiful dreams." "The eyes twinkled." "Trapped under the eyelids.." "..are many beautiful dreams." "Only for a few moments.." "..the times gone by took shape before us." "Call out to those moments of the past in excitement." "After many years of waiting.." "..this evening has arrived in our lives." "Love has been kindled." "Let's be happy about it." "After many years of waiting.." "..this evening has arrived in our lives." What is going on? Stop! Stop! - Who is he? Who is he? Moti! Moti! Move! Rekha, how does Moti know him? Daddy, he's a servant at his house. - What? But how come he is here? Let's go, Shiv. Didn't I tell you not to come out of this room? Why did you come out? You.. Shambhu, bring some food for Shiv. Are you hurt? No, Brother. Not at all. Okay, sit here. Now, we are suspicious. I wonder what kind of samples there are at your in-laws. Look, Mr. Moti is here. Mr. Moti, your servant is very interesting. I was really scared. Stop it! He's not a servant. He's my younger brother. Brother? - Yes, my real brother. Give me that. Shiv? Shiv? Moti, did you find your brother? No. - Really. It was disgraceful. Not in my wildest dreams did I think.. ..that Rekha would say such things. No matter what, we are relatives. She's really a stupid girl. But Moti, you're quite sensible. Why did you make such a mistake? Before calling your brother here you should have told him.. ..about the society you are now part of. And what kind of a society it is. I didn't call him, Daddy. He came all by himself. - Oh. I need to talk to you in this regard. Yes, tell me. Daddy, I need some money. Money? By all means. How much do you need? Around Rs.8000 to Rs.10000. - That's it? I thought.. But why do you want it? You may have seen that the land I was tilling is ours. But brother mortgaged that land to provide for my education. He notice had received that If we won't return his money in three months.. ..then we will lose that land. Don't be silly Moti. Let go that land. Why are you getting neverse for that? If all you want is land, then buy a plot in.. ..New Alipore or on VIP road and build a house. You're getting me wrong, Daddy. I'm not talking about such land.. ..but about the land which represents the honour of a farmer. If a brother staked his honour for his younger brother.. ..then it's the duty of the younger brother to get it back. Moti, you have a duty towards us as well. I've never said anything to you till now. But I'll say it today. Now, you should forget that you're a farmer. Because you're not just my junior today.. ..you're my son-in-law too. Daddy, I understand what you're trying to say. But my brother, sister-in-law.. ..and the whole family survives because of that land. So what? I've seen their standard of living. Send them Rs.30 or Rs.40 a month. They would survive. Daddy.. - Am I wrong? My brother and sister-in-law are poor.. ..but they're not beggars. They will never accept the alms I give them. But Moti, the money you're asking from me.. ..would also be considered as alms. Because you have not earned that money. I'm sorry, Daddy. I've made a mistake. Shiv. You've come so soon? Yes, Sister-in-law. And didn't Moti's wife come along? What do I say, sister-in-law? Moti's wife packed her things and was ready to come along. But I thought if I bring sister-in-law along.. ..who would cook for Brother Moti? You did the right thing. Otherwise, Moti would have been inconvenienced. How is your sister-in-law? - What? She's nice. She's very nice. I hope she showered her affection on you. Affection? What can I say, Sister-in-law? She showered me with so much affection.. More than you do. I see. - Yes. She made me sit. She served food affectionately. And in front of all those rich people.. ..she said that I was Brother Moti's.. Sister-in-law, I'm famished. Give me some food. Freshen up. I'll get it right away. Shiv, come here. Shiv? Shiv.. - Shiv, you've returned from Kolkata? Sukhiya, go sit there. Go there. Shiv, you talked a lot with your sister-in-law. Now, tell me what really happened. Why are you silent? Speak. I'll endure everything. I got it. I understood everything. But what's there to be sad about? Moti has become a rich man's son-in-law. Brother, forget Brother Moti. - I'll forget him. That's not difficult. Shiv, I'm glad I didn't educate you. To hell with education. Teacher! Stop! What is it? - Teacher, don't you have a home? Yes, of course. - Then don't you have a father, mother and siblings? Yes, I have everyone. - Then go home. Why are you running our families by telling us to get educated? He's out to educate us! Teacher? Teacher. - What is it, Shiv? Don't take brother's words seriously. You know that brother speaks in that manner. But what happened? Well.. Nothing, Teacher. Nothing, Teacher. The Kolkata returned gentleman is so angry. Shiv, why are you angry? I didn't know you'd return from Kolkata so soon. I never thought you love me so much. Go away. I didn't come back early for you. What? - Yes. I was forced to return. But now I have to go forever. Why? - Why? Go ask your miserly father.. ..who has ordered us to repay within three months. Understood? Didn't you meet Brother Moti? I did. Didn't he give you the money? You were right, Radha. Witches live in Kolkata. They cast a spell of young guys and convert them into cowards. But listen. I warn you. After marrying me, if you call my brother a servant.. ..then I'll break your jaw. Understood? What has happened to you today? Why are you saying such things? I thought we'd be meeting after many days. We'll have a nice chat. You'll tell me about Kolkata. But you want to break my jaw and what not. Why? That's because you're also a woman. And all women are the same. Except for eldest sister-in-law. Look, Shiv, if you behave like this with me.. ..then I warn you, I'll never come to meet you. Radha. Radha, why don't you understand? Brother Moti.. I couldn't get money from Brother Moti. And we never will. That's why I want to go back to Kolkata again. I will earn money over there. I will get back our land. This is the only land we have, Radha. I'll have to go to Kolkata. No. No. I won't let you go to Kolkata. You just said that that place is full of witches. They will take you away from me. I'll never let that happen. - Radha. I'll never let that happen. If you leave me, I swear I'll commit suicide. Radha. Radha! Radha! Radha! Mother-in-law, had I known earlier.. ..I'd have come to receive you at the station. Don't bother about such formalities, Hari. Now I'm taking refuge in Lord Almighty forever. I thought I should meet you before leaving. And meet Radha as well. - I see. Very well. Mother-in-law, this.. Grandma! Radha! Grandma! - Radha. Grandma, when did you come? Just a while ago. But where had you been? Do you still like the trees in the jungle? No, Mother-in-law. She's a grown up now, but she's still so naīve. Be quiet. What's her fault? This is what happens to kids.. ..who lose their mothers in their childhood. Had Shanti been alive today.. Well, forget it. Since I'm renouncing wealth and worldly attachments.. ..I won't shed any tears. Come on, Grandma. I won't let you go so easily. Now, you'll live with me. No, silly girl. Don't drag me back into this material world. Since I've made my decision to leave.. But mother-in-law, your land.. - I've ended that problem. I've given some land to charity and sold the rest of the land. So much land and property.. What have you done? I've done the right thing, Hari. You should be happy that I gave everything in charity.. ..and added to my virtues. Did you think I'd write it all to you and you'd reap the benefits? Look, son. You shouldn't desire wealth of your in-laws. Understood? - What are you saying, Mother-in-law? Son, I'm saying the right thing. Mother-in-law, you always get me wrong. Yes, Hari. I understand you very well and I know you. Your whole life has been spent accumulating money. Mother-in-law, you're really amazing. Well, forget it. These things don't matter much. Let me finish the work I came here for. Dear, give me my box. Give it to me. Here you are, Grandma. I've brought this with utmost care. - Yes, Mother-in-law. This is for my journey expenses. - I see. Listen. - Yes. I've written off 15 acres of land in Radha's name. - I see. I see. Here's the paperwork. Read it. - Okay. And here's Rs.10000. Give it to me. - Don't touch it. It's not for you. - Okay. It's for Radha. Don't spend a penny from this on Radha's wedding. No, Mother-in-law. I won't spend a penny from it. - Yes. Radha can spend this money as per her wishes. - Okay. Understood? - Yes. Radha, here are the keys. Take this money and keep it in the safe yourself. Yes. - Is that okay, Mother-in-law? - Yes, absolutely. Take it. - Take this, dear. Keep it safe. But grandma, will go today itself? - Yes, dear. I have to catch the 10pm train from Patna. And I'll be visiting the landlord as well. Mother-in-law is right. Never delay a good deed. Keep this money in the safe quickly, dear. Go quickly. Quickly. But mother-in-law, what's the hurry? You could have rested for a day or two. Well, since you've decided to leave, I'll see you off to Patna. But why should you take the trouble? How would Radha live alone in such a big house? Mother-in-law, she is always alone. Because I visit Patna quite often because of my business. Well, there's nothing to worry. I'll ask Sunderlal to sleep in the house at night. Okay? Then it's fine. You're taking it too easy. Hurry up. It's 7:30pm. May I say something, Rekha? If you don't mind, you should go to the party alone? I'm not feeling well today. I know you're making an excuse. What has happened to you these few days? You're always so gloomy. Come on, get up. Please. Don't insist, Rekha. - What? Do you want .. .. the society to make fun of me? Rekha, the other day you said you can give up everything for me. The society which makes fun of you because of me.. ..can't you give it up? - Why not? I'll definitely give it up when needed. But come with me today. I'm telling the truth, Rekha, I don't feel quite well today. Besides, I've got some important work to do. Listen to me and go there alone. If anyone asks about me, tell him I'm not keeping well. I know very well what I have to say when asked about you. You don't have to tutor me. Rekha, listen to me. Hello. Yes, this is Moti speaking. Is this Ramesh? I've been waiting for your phone call. Were you able to arrange for it? Oh. What? No, I badly needed that money, so.. Well, forget it. Okay. Yes. Shiv. Radha? What is it, Radha? - Come out for a moment. What happened? - Just come outside. Yes, I'm coming. Who is it? - It's nobody, Brother. It is I. What is it? - Nothing, Brother. It's nothing. Radha. What is it, Radha? Come here. - What is it? Just come with me. Tell me. What is it? Shiv, you don't have to go to Kolkata. - Why not? Look at this. - Oh, my God! Where did you get so much money from? This is my money not my father's. My grandma gave it to me. But I won't take this money. - Why not? I can't take this money, Radha. But why? Isn't my money yours as well? That's not the problem, Radha. Why don't you understand? If I take so much money, what would I tell my brother? I don't know that. But don't tell him I gave it to you. That's all right, but what do I say to him? Brother would think that I stole this money. No, Radha. I won't take this money. Okay. I won't take the money back home and I won't go either. What are you saying, Radha? Look, my father is not a good man. I don't know what he asked your brother to write off. If your brother doesn't pay the money, he'll lose the land. What will you do if you lose your land? Look, take this money. Otherwise.. otherwise, I'll commit suicide. Oh, no! You always threaten to do that. Always. It's not a threat, Shiv. I swear, if you don't take the money, I'll commit.. Enough, Radha. That's enough. Be quiet. Don't cry. Will you take the money? - Money? But what do I tell brother? Say anything that comes to your mind. Keep the money. Will you take it? Okay, should I leave? It's too late. Radha. - Shiv! Shiv! Shiv! I thought I saw someone over there. - What? Oh, no. There's no one. What's there to be afraid of? Come. I'll see you home. Parbatiya. - What? Come here. What is it? I think I should mortgage the land to Laxmichand, the moneylender. That would get Mr. Hari off my back. Can I say something? - What? Write a letter to Moti. I think we have been mistaken.. Look, don't mention Moti in front of me. Understood? He's a rich man's son-in-law and we are poor farmers. Moti. Bring my coat. Brother. - What is it? You don't have to go anywhere asking for money. - Why? Look at this. Shiv, where did you get so much money from? Answer me. Where did you get so much money from? No, Brother. It's not what you think. - Then what is it? Where did you get so much money from? Answer me. Where did you get so much money from? Speak up, Shiv. This money? Brother Moti sent it. Brother Moti. Moti sent it? Where did you meet him? I went out last night. When you asked, "Who is it?" It was Brother Moti's friend. He gave this to me. Shiv, was it Moti's friend or Moti himself? No, Sister-in-law. It was Brother Moti's friend. Would that shameless guy show us his face? Forget it, brother. Take this money, go to Mr. Hari.. ..and get our land papers back. I'll go to the fields today. Sister-in-law, can I get something to eat? No, let it be. Send it to the fields. Where are you lost? You're smiling a lot. Hold this. Go bring my coat. Go on. "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, madam?" "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, madam?" "This is a bond of love." "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, sir?" "The one with kohl in your eyes.." "..why do you get decked up again?" "The one with kohl in your eyes.." "..why do you get decked up again?" "Darling, tell me the meaning of that look before you leave." "There's only one meaning." "There's only one meaning.." "..my eyes are calling for you." "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, sir?" "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, madam?" "Look, the clouds have gathered.." "..at the call of the breeze." "Look, the clouds have gathered.." "..at the call of the breeze." "My love has won. My ignorant lover has lost." "It would be great fun.. great fun.." "..this game of victory and defeat." "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, madam?" "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, sir?" "Behind the veil, the face is not fully visible." "Behind the veil, the face is not fully visible." "Come in my arms." "Let our meeting be complete." "This meeting is not.." "..just a onetime affair." "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, sir? - Where are you going, madam?" "This is a bond of love." "Secretly, you and I are bonded to each other." "Where are you going, sir? - Where are you going, madam?" As if my Moti has begged for it. Money. Brother Ganga! - I'm in a hurry! I don't have time! Wait! This is important! Fool, I was going for some work and he stopped me. Brother Ganga. - What is it? There's bad news. - What bad news? The police inspector is coming. - What? - Yes. Why? - I've heard that he'll search your house. What are you saying? - The truth. That's why I came running to give you the news. To search my house? - Yes. Come with me. - Okay. There it is, Inspector. What is it, sir? Gangaram, I have to search your house. Search my house? Sir, why my house? Listen to that, Inspector. He acts so ignorant. Gangaram. - Yes? Last night, Rs.10000 was stolen from Mr. Hari's house. Your brother Shivram has stolen that money. Sir, it's not true. Shiv can't do such a thing. Yes. He can't do that. I've seen it myself, Gangaram. Shiv jumped over the compound wall.. ..of Mr. Hari's house last night. Yes, sir. Last night? - Yes. Let's go, Gangaram. I have to search your house. Wait a minute, sir. So, last night he lied to me. Sir, there's no need to search the house. There's no need, sir. Here's the Rs.10000. - Look at this. - Here's Rs.10000. As far as the thief is concerned, then come with me. Let's go. - Just come with me. Shiv. Shiv. Shiv. - Yes. Did Moti send that money? Right? Right? No brother! - You fool! Brother.. - We'll not spare him. Brother, I'm telling the truth. I didn't steal it. Brother, I'm telling the truth. I didn't steal it. Here he is, Inspector. Take him away. Take him away. Hang him! - Get up, Shivram. I didn't steal it, brother. Brother.. - I'm not your brother. Don't ever show us your face. - Brother. We'll think that our Shiv is dead. - Brother.. Take him away, Inspector. Get him out of my sight. Take him away. Take him away. Brother Ganga, have patience. What is it, Inspector? What could it be, Teacher? Shivram stole Rs.10000 from Mr. Hari's house. Shiv stole the money? - Yes, Teacher. Teacher, I'm telling the truth. I didn't steal. Come on. - I didn't steal it, Teacher. Who is drunk? Parbatiya! Parbatiya.. Look at this. She's standing here. Parbatiya. Parbatiya. Did you hear it? Your Shiv is a thief. He stole Rs.10000. - That's a lie. I don't believe it. Shiv can never steal. If he can't, then how did Sunderlal see him? Your mother-in-law has given you such wonderful brothers-in-law. One became the live-in son-in-law of a rich man. The other became a thief. Parbatiya, I beat him up. I beat him up badly. I beat up Shiv like an animal in public. And I warned him, "Don't ever show us your face." "I'll think that my brother is dead." Oh, God! - Quiet! Quiet! Don't you dare cry! Look here. Look at me. Am I crying? Why should I cry? Should I cry over my step-brothers? That's why I have beaten him. And then consumed drink. Didn't I said you? That I won't drink. But I have drink again. Much more. Great my son. Oh my Moti. Inspector, I assure you there's something fishy. You are the protector of the law. I hope an innocent doesn't get punished by mistake. Teacher, why do you forget.. ..that Sunderlal saw Shivram leave Mr. Hari's house? Well, that is fine. But I will request you again. Meet Mr. Hari's daughter Radha once. Radha? - Yes. But how is Radha connected to this theft? There is a connection. How do I explain to you? I see. So, is that the case? - Yes. I'm sure, a meeting with Radha will lead you to the truth. Let me explain to you. Actually, the inspector is coming here to talk to you. If you tell him that you gave Shiv that money.. ..then things will go terribly wrong. And then Shiv will be booked for a greater offence. And he'll get a harsher punishment. If I gave him the money, then what's Shiv's crime? You'll not understand that. You're still a kid. You're immature. The inspector will write in his report.. ..that Shiv misled you and got the money through you. This is not about a few rupees, Radha. This is about Rs.10000. What do I have to say to the inspector? Yes. I'll see to it that you don't have to say anything. But if the inspector doesn't listen to me.. ..then just tell him that you know nothing about the money. Then I'll talk to the inspector and get Shiv released. What are you looking at? I'm not asking you to say something wrong. This is legal stuff. You won't understand. I understood, Father. Please come, Inspector. Dear, the inspector has come. Wait right here. I'll call you when needed. Welcome, Inspector. - Hello. Take a seat. It's an honour to have such a respectable person in my house. You are respectable, Mr. Hari. We're in constant touch with thieves and criminals. Yes, that's fine. Sunderlal, arrange for some snacks for the inspector. That's not needed. Please call your daughter. I'd like to ask her some questions. Inspector, times have changed. In the past, women of our family.. ..would never go in front of outsiders. - Yes. You are right. But your daughter is like my daughter. Yes, absolutely.. As you wish. Dear Radha. Dear Radha. Radha, come here, dear. Come here. Look, your inspector uncle has come. Greet him, dear. - Hello. He wants to ask you something. Radha, I want to ask you about that Rs.10,000. If you know, then tell me the truth. Yes, dear. Say that you don't know anything about that money. Mr. Hari, I'm asking this question to your daughter.. ..and not to you. Yes, of course. Dear.. Inspector, I had given.. ..that money to Shiv. - Radha! Mr. Hari, I'm going. I've found out whatever I wanted to know. Wretched man. Idiot. He took Rs.500 from me too.. He didn't take it, sir. He returned it. It's amazing, sir. That inspector is very generous. But our Radha.. - She has become over-smart. Radha! Radha! Brother Ganga. - Here comes master. Welcome. Come, Master. Did you hear? My Shiv.. my step-brother Shivram.. ..committed a theft, he is a thief. No, Brother Ganga. - Yes? Shiv has not committed the robbery. The inspector is going to release him. I have come here to take you. What? Master? Yes. Radha had given that money to Shiv. Radha had given it to Shiv? - Yes. So, Shiv didn't commit the robbery? Shiv is not a thief? Parbatiya. Parbatiya. Our Shiv is not a thief. Our Shiv is not a thief. Master, I've hit him. I thrashed him real hard, master. I hit him like an animal before the entire village. I hit him because I'm his step-brother. Don't cry, brother Ganga. Don't cry. Come on. Come to the police station with me. Come on. Shivram, come on. Yes. You may go. Come in, Master, I want to talk with you. Shiv! No. I won't show my face to you. You had forbidden me to show you my face. You said that you will think that your Shiv has died. Shiv. Shiv, take it. Hit me to your heart's content, Shiv. Hit me before everyone. Take it. Shiv! I'm telling the truth, Sheela. I don't attend any parties of late. No, don't misunderstand me. It is not so. Rekha. - Excuse me. Rekha. Rekha, do you know what consequences.. ..I had to face because of your childishness today? My status, prestige, position, everything is ruined. What happened, Daddy? - What else? The man who was not worth to become the servant of this house.. ..I made him my son-in-law because of your stubbornness. Daddy? - I ask, how long will he keep defaming me? It was already difficult for me to face the society because of him.. ..and he put me to shame at the bar too today. Those people who used to seek help from me.. He had gone to beg before them. It's disgusting. I'll speak to him, Daddy. What will you talk to him now? He has crossed the limits. If he wanted to improve, he would have improved long ago. The appearance of a man can be changed.. ..by knowledge and get up, not his character. The values of his family can't be changed. The biggest thing is, Rekha, the genes can't be changed. Listen. Won't you let me live peacefully at home? Daddy was saying.. - I've heard everything. So, is it true that you had gone to beg from that man? Yes. I had gone. Because your daddy himself had.. Moti, you think only your brother and sister-in-law.. ..are respectable, my dad doesn't have any respect? Rekha, your daddy is not only my father-in-law.. ..but my guru too. Perhaps no one will respect him as me. My brother and sister-in-law are illiterates.. ..but if you make some mistake they will abuse you, not your family. Not your blood. But your daddy is not an illiterate. He is educated. He is cultured, in spite of it.. Listen, Moti, you always criticise daddy.. ..but you forget that today too you depend.. ..on him to feed you twice a day. Rekha! Where have they both gone? Baby is not feeling well, she won't eat food. And son-in-law has left the house forever. What? He has left the house? Yes, I'm sorry, sir. After all, son-in-law is a farmer's son. A farmer's blood runs in his veins. The farmer who toils round-the-clock to feed the people.. ..how can he bear if he is taunted.. ..about being fed twice a day? - Shut up! You are talking too much. Shiv! I was searching you. Why? What's the matter? Radha has called you. She is sitting at Lord Shiva temple. Okay, you go. I'm coming. Radha! Radha! Radha! You. Yes, Shivram. Radha was feeling shy to say this to you.. ..that's why I had to come. Actually, Shivram, I can't marry Radha with you. It is a question of my respect. And I can't see Radha unhappy too. She has agreed to marry a boy of my choice with great difficulty. Yes, but she has laid a condition.. ..that I will have to return your land without taking a penny. Of course. Look, I have brought the documents too. Has Radha said this? Then am I lying? It is the matter of my daughter's happiness. Otherwise it is not a joke to let go Rs.7000-Rs.8,000.. ..in today's world, Shivram. But I have one condition too. Tell me. I will return your land but you will have to go away.. ..from the village till Radha gets married. If you need more money for it, I'm ready to give that too. All right. I will leave the village. I promise you. I knew, Son. Take the documents. No. We are poor farmers but not beggars. Instead of two-three months, give me one year's time. I will earn money and get my land released. Son, forget about one year, I'll give you three years time. Repay my loan whenever you get money. Anyway, I was ready to give you the land right now. "The land calls out." "The land calls out." "I feel like mocking over this strange matter." "I feel like mocking over this strange matter." "My dear ones are ashamed of my soil." "Why do I have these worthless illusions?" "My everything belongs to one who touches me lovingly." "The land calls out." "The land calls out." - Hey? What are you doing, Brother? Sir, shall I clean it? All right, do it. But don't steal anything. - No, sir. "I'm looking forward with hopeful eyes.." Hey? What is this? I don't have another cloth to clean it, sir. I think you have newly arrived to this city. No, sir, I didn't come flying but by the train. I want to earn money. - I see. Yes, sir. I want to earn money and get my land released. My land is mortgaged with the landlord. You will get your land released by cleaning the cars? Brother, I had come to this city one day with this dream. I thought I'll earn money and get my land released.. ..but that dream was shattered and I lost my land too. Why are you so shocked? I am telling the truth. Not only you or me, lakhs of farmers like us.. ..had come to this city with this dream. Someone became a coolie, a worker or a rickshaw driver. But no one returned back. Everyone is struggling hard in this city and breathing their last. Sir.. - Did you panic? Did you get scared on hearing the truth? No, sir. I will have to earn money. I will have to get my land released. I've been given one year's time. I see. How much will you be able to earn.. ..by cleaning the cars in one year? Okay, do you know to drive? Yes, sir. I can drive the bullock-cart very well. I'm not talking about the bullock-cart but taxi, motorcar. But I've never seen this in my village, sir. But it is the only way for you to earn some more money. But who will teach me? I don't even have a place to stay here. I see. So, you depend on the care of footpath. Never mind, buddy. My dream has not fulfilled.. ..but let's try to fulfil your dream. Come with me. - Where, sir? To my mansion. Three-four wrestlers like you are already present there. Really? - Yes. Sit. Wait. First, promise me. - What, sir? If you are able to earn money in your life.. ..you will return to your village. If you are unable to get that land released.. ..you will buy another plot of land. You will not die on the footpath of this city.. ..but in your village, on your land. I promise. I promise. - Sit. Let it be, Uncle. In today's world and in our society.. ..why do you have to think of this and worry? I see. I know, Ashok. But actually, this girl is stubborn like her mother. Sometimes I feel that her thinking is very old-fashioned. You know, Ashok, your aunt never.. ..compromised with me in her life. And this girl has got the same nature. Not only aunt, she must be affected.. ..by that man's company too. Let some time pass. Everything will be normal automatically. By thinking this, I told your daddy to call you here from abroad. Perhaps you don't know, Ashok.. ..your daddy and I had seen this dream long before.. ..that you and Rekha.. Rekha? - Come, Rekha. Hello, Ashok. - Hello, Rekha. You both sit and talk. Till then I'll go and change. Please be seated. Your daddy seems very disturbed. Don't worry about it. Why did you return from abroad all of a sudden? I had heard that you will settle there. I had this intention. But I received daddy's letter.. ..all of a sudden, in which it was written.. ..that I am appointed as your daddy's junior here. And uncle was also saying that.. Have tea. - Thank you. I think it's not good for you to remain indoors round-the-clock. You should go for outings. You should enjoy. I've also heard that you have stopped.. ..attending any parties nowadays. You have returned just a few days back.. ..but it seems you have come to know a lot about me. Why not? Your daddy has told me a little about you.. ..and you know such rumours do spread in our society. It is reason for which I've stopped attending the parties, Ashok. It is fine but still.. Baby, there is madam Sheela's call for you. Excuse me. Please sit, I think daddy must be coming. That will be sorted out, Sunder. That is fine, sir. But Mr. Choudhary of Chandanpur is very old. Sunderlal, not the age but the family matters.. ..while fixing a marriage. One has to care for the status. I have fixed the date too. Tenth of the next month. Really? - Yes. Sir, do you know something? Forget about giving any dowry at our Radha's wedding.. ..he will shoulder for the wedding expenses of both the parties. I see. So, this is the real thing. - Yes. What say? I couldn't find out anything. I couldn't find out anything. Kolkata is a strange city. I drive the bullock-cart. If you ask this to anyone in the village.. ..he will tell you who is Sukhiya. He drives a motor here but no one knows him. I don't understand what will happen now. Brother Sukhiya, how much trouble will you take for me? Let me board the train for Kashi. I will go to grandmother's place. Then you return to the village. Yes, I should return to the village. Well said. If your father would have come to know by now.. ..that I've escorted you, he will peel off my skin. Then he will beat me black and blue. Then why did you stop me? You should have let me die. Everything would have been fine. I am unfortunate after all. Look, you have started crying. Silly, I didn't tell you anything. Don't cry. I won't leave you alone here. But what should we do? Radha, I had completely forgotten it.. ..that Moti is an advocate here and he must be visiting the court. He must know Shiv's address too. Come on, let's reach the court asking the way from the people. Come on, hurry up. Come on. Sir, at least I should get this case, it will be best for me. Please try your best. I shall be very grateful to you. I will try my best, Mr. Moti. Don't worry. - Thank you. What are you looking at? - Nothing. Moti. - You and here? Sukhiya is exhausted while wandering. I am not alone. She is with me too. Radha? How did she come here? What else? In search of Shiv. Shiv is here at Kolkata? - Listen to him. - Hey? Don't you know? He has left the village one year ago. He drives the taxi here nowadays. One year has passed and I haven't come to know. Moti, you will have to find out now. Radha has come here. Radha, you have done a wrong thing. Why did you come here without informing? What else? Her father fixed her wedding elsewhere. What should I tell you, Moti? She was about to commit suicide. Thank God that I spotted her. She said that whom she has accepted as her husband.. ..before God once, only he is her husband. If she doesn't get him, why will she survive? I didn't know the address too. But I thought I will definitely find you in this court. Forget whatever that has happened. Come on. But Moti, if you take Radha to your in-law's place.. No, Sukhiya. That question doesn't arise now. I've left my in-law's place. Come on. Rekha! Rekha! What's wrong, Daddy? You are asking this to me? Go and ask that idiot who has cheated me. He has played with my daughter's life. What are you saying? Rekha, do you know that idiot has a second wife? Daddy? - Yes, he was already married. And today his wife has come here from the village. No. It is impossible. I knew that you won't believe me. But I've heard and seen everything. That girl's name is Radha. If you still don't believe me then call up Mr. Surendra and ask him. He was also with me. What are you looking at? Do you think I'm deceiving you? No, Daddy. You can never do such a cheap thing. You would always say that for a woman her husband.. ..is her God and his house is her heaven. I didn't see the heaven, but is this the form of God? Is this the result of true love and trust? Madam, Mr. Ashok has come. -Shall I tell him to go? No. Tell him to sit. I'll change my clothes and come. Hello, Mr. Ashok. - Hello, Rekha. Have a seat. Be seated. Really, Ms. Rekha, I am extremely shocked.. ..to hear these things. I couldn't even dream that the man whom you loved so much.. Forget about him. You talk about yourself. Why don't you come here nowadays? What should I tell you, Ms. Rekha? I felt as if you don't like my visits here. Don't be silly. So what will you have? Tea? No need for it. If you don't mind, let's go for a drive. You will feel better and.. Do you think I'm upset? Let's go wherever you wish. Please come. Please come. This is my dream house which I've brought. It's very late. I think we will come to see it some other day. Let's go now. What's the harm in seeing it when you've come till here? For the sake of my happiness. Ms. Rekha, I think you are still unable to forget.. ..that rustic and uncultured man. Let's go. - Please come. That day has arrived today luckily for which I waited for long. Please come. Please be seated. Now, tell me, what would you like to have? Something cold or something hot? Pardon? No, thank you. I think we should leave now. It's very late. Daddy will think.. - No. Your daddy will be happy on hearing that you've come with me. Perhaps because he doesn't know you well. - Pardon? Let's go. No. - Ashok? I won't let you go in this way. Your daddy has told me to win your heart anyhow. How did you even think that you can win.. ..a girl's heart in this manner? Get aside. No. If I can't win your heart, I'll make you helpless, weak. You have often insulted me in many ways. I will shatter your pride today. - Ashok! Rekha! I love you, Rekha. I love you. I can't live without you, Rekha. - Shut up! Open the door or I will scream. Shout. Shout to your heart's content. But it's of no use to shout. No one will hear your voice within these four walls. No one will hear your voice in this isolation. So, you have proved to be a beast after all. - Yes. Please let me go. Where will you go? No! Come on. No! So, you won't remove your clothes? No! No! No! No! Why have you come here? - Idiot! Shiv! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law, go down and sit in the taxi. - No! No, Shiv. I'll take revenge with this decent man and be right back. - No. What are you doing? Come on. Go, Sister-in-law. Go. - No, Shiv. Shiv. Sister-in-law, go. So, sir, we are rustic, uncultured, but you are decent. Is this the example of your decency.. ..to rape someone else's daughter-in-law? You dare to do this. Take this. Take this. Get up. Shiv, this.. Let it be. Sister-in-law, is this the custom of your society.. ..to leave your husband at home and go out with an outsider? Why not? After all what has your brother done with me. He kept it a secret from me that he was already married. Sister-in-law, what are you saying? I am telling the truth. His wife has come from the village. Her name is Radha. Radha? Radha has come here? Do you know her? Sister-in-law, of course, I know her. Radha is.. - Shiv! Come on, let's go home. I'll tell you everything. Come on. Shiv, won't you come in? No, Sister-in-law. One day I had come to this house.. ..considering it my brother and sister-in-law's house. But I had to leave in tears from here. Now I will never come to this house. I'll never come, Sister-in-law. Rekha, where are you going? Where I am supposed to go. - Don't be silly. Go upstairs. What has happened all of a sudden.. ..for which you are leaving this house? Daddy, I've come to my senses today. I've seen your society, culture and everything. And my in-laws too. Don't talk nonsense. Do you want to go to that hell? Do you want to go to that hell? Yes, Daddy. No. You can't go. I have already decided. - What? All right. Then hear my decision too. If you will leave, these doors will be shut for you forever. You won't get a single paisa from my wealth. I am a daughter-in-law of a farmer's family. Why do I need your wealth? Shut up! Get out! Get out! I say get out! No! I'll think my daughter is dead. Radha, look whom have I brought. See who has come. What has happened? Nothing. But why have you come like this, Radha? I had promised your father. That's why he extended the time limit to repay his loan. I wonder what will happen now. How your father will take revenge with my brother? I was unable to control myself, Shiv. I had gone to commit suicide. Brother Sukhiya saved me. Radha? - Yes. You always thought that I just threaten you. I've accepted you as my husband before God.. ..that's why I have come to you. If you don't want to give me support then tell me.. ..I'll go anywhere but never become a burden on you. Don't say this, Radha. You don't know I was so hurt while leaving you and coming here. But what should I do? I had to do it for the sake of brother's land. I'm brother's step-brother. But brother and sister-in-law have brought me up.. ..like their own child. Today brother Moti is taking all the pain for elder brother. That's why I had to repent for it. Shiv, is the land everything to you? Am I of no importance? What are you saying? Don't you know what you are for me? I am here at Kolkata since one year. I swear, I didn't even glance towards any girl. Shiv! - Radha! Oh, Shiv! Don't cry, Radha. Don't cry. What's the matter, Sukhiya? What else? Radha and Kishan have reconciled. Radha? Has Shiv come? - Yes. Where are you going? I'm standing here. Shiv! Shiv! Shiv! - Brother Moti! Shiv! Shiv! - Brother Moti! Brother Moti! Shiv, what has happened to you? It's nothing. It's just a minor injury. Yes. Shiv. Shiv. Shiv, what wrong have I done that you are here in Kolkata.. ..since one year and you didn't come to meet me once? Is your brother Moti so bad that you don't want to see his face? No, Brother Moti, forgive me. I had misunderstood you. No one has understood me right. I have become the victim of all the misunderstandings. No, Brother. Shiv, I want to tell you something today. The land which brother has mortgaged to educate me.. ..I won't show him my face till I get it released. Though I may die. It is not a great thing, Brother Moti. I also earn now. We both will save money and get our land released. But, brother Moti, Radha has created a big problem. She has come here all of a sudden.. ..now I wonder how her father will treat brother. What will he do? He can't do anything. Radha has taken a good decision to come here. Shiv, you are so fortunate. I wonder when she accepted you before Lord. And she left everything considering that relationship true. This illiterate, rustic, innocent village girl.. ..is incomparable to Rekha.. - No, Brother Moti.. ..we have misunderstood sister-in-law too. Actually, sister-in-law is very nice. Did you meet Rekha? Yes. I forgot to tell you. She returned home in my taxi. I'm telling you, Brother. Please meet sister-in-law once. No, Shiv. I've left that house after being insulted a lot. Now, I will never go there again. Oh, Sister-in-law! Rekha, you and here? - Yes. Why have you come? I've left everything and come to you forever. But what about your wealth and your society? Won't you find it difficult to make such a big sacrifice? Why? If you can abandon your wife whom.. ..you had accepted as your wife with fire as the witness.. ..can't I leave the wealth and society? Forget it. Daddy has shut the doors of his house for me forever. Now tell me. Are the doors of this house are shut for me too? What are you saying? Who can close the doors of this house for you, Sister-in-law? Who can dare to do this? If brother Moti taunts you, I'll write.. ..a letter to elder brother right now. Look at this. Why are you crying? Radha, what are you doing there? Come here. Come quickly. Look here. She is my sister-in-law. Look how beautiful she is. Isn't she? Oh, Radha! It is a day to rejoice. Brother Moti, why are you sitting with a downtrodden face? You do something too. - What should I do? Keep quiet. Why are you like this? I wish I could fly and get brother and sister-in-law back. Right, Sukhiya? No. Never. I will never go there. - Why? Why? Shiv, you sing that song. Which song was it? Oh, yes. "It's the night to rejoice. Dance gracefully." Master! Master! Master! What's wrong? Sister-in-law? Master, come quickly. The police have arrested brother Ganga. Why? What's the matter? I don't know, Master. Brother Ganga is cutting the harvest in his farm. The police came and said this farm belongs to Mr. Hari. And they have taken brother Ganga.. ..under the allegation of stealing the harvest. How is it possible? Sister-in-law, that is your land. Only we know it, Master. But I've heard that Mr. Hari has shown the court documents.. ..to the police, so the land belongs to him. - What? Yes, Master. This plot of land has become a curse for our family. Both of my brother-in-laws have gone away because of it.. ..and today my husband is going to the jail. You take me to him. I will fall at his feet and say he should take this plot and spare us. We will leave the village. We will eat one time meal but we don't want this plot. No, Sister-in-law. Your plot of land is not the entire country. And there is not one but many Mr. Hari. The landlords have gone but many money lenders.. ..have taken their place like Mr. Hari. And the same atrocity is done today too. This news can't reach the law .. ..but the sufferers.. ..are still weak and illiterates. And not one but many people like brother Ganga.. ..lose everything and leave the village. This won't happen now. This has to be revolted. Shiv, who is Mr. Mahesh? He is the master of our village. But Sister-in-law, what's wrong? Is any bad news written in the letter? Yes, Shiv. Listen. Dear Shiv, as soon you get this letter.. ..come to Manupur immediately with Mr. Moti. Your family is facing a grave problem. On the basis of a false appeal, Mr. Hari has taken.. ..the rights of the land from the court. Brother Ganga is in police custody today. I tried my best but I couldn't get his bail granted. Mr. Hari has done all this cautiously. Shiv, the biggest thing to grieve is.. I already knew that it will happen. All this is happening because of her. I'm having many problems since my name is linked with my family. She left her house and came here. Unlucky girl! Your work is ruined if you see her face. I feel like strangling her throat. Shiv, come to your senses. What are you doing? Go. Go bring your brother immediately. Go. "The drape explains to you to hold my hand." "The drape explains to you to hold my hand." "The kohl explains to you to embrace me." "I'm fed up of explaining all this." "He is so foolish, he doesn't understand love." "Go and cry there." "Dark clouds go to my beloved's door." "He is so foolish, he doesn't understand love." "He is so foolish, he doesn't understand love." Rekha! Radha! Rekha? Where have everyone gone leaving the doors open? Rekha? Where had you all gone? - I had gone to bring this letter. And where is Radha? Radha? She is at home. She is not at home. Where has she gone if she is not present at home? What if out of sorrow.. Out of sorrow? Yes. Shiv had abused her in a fit of anger. What did he say? What did you tell her? Nothing, Brother. I got angry on hearing the letter. And I.. But I didn't.. - Shut up! Stupid! Fool! Rustic boy! You have grown up but you are still childish. I feel like giving you a tight slap. I wonder where she must have gone. I don't see Sukhiya around too. What are you waiting for? Go bring your taxi. Find both of them. Is it the same letter? - Yes. Have you read it? - Yes. I never dreamt that daddy will do this with us. Why are you panicking? We will have to face it. Repeat with me. I will tell only the truth. I will tell only the truth. Nothing except the truth. - Nothing except the truth. Is it true, Mr. Hari, that you wanted to marry off.. ..your daughter to Gangaram's younger brother? Yes. What did you want to give as dowry? I had said that I'll let go the debt and give the land for free. Gangaram, is it true? He had promised something like this. Then why didn't this wedding take place? Because Gangaram's younger brother was already married, sir. Oh, I see. Point to be noted, Your Honour. Gangaram, is it true that you went to fix the proposal.. ..your already married brother with Mr. Hari's daughter? Sir, I didn't know that Moti is already married. Mr. Hari, when did you come to know about it? When I arranged a feast for the village out of happiness.. ..there I announced that my Radha's wedding is fixed with Moti. After that. Was Moti also present in that feast along with Gangaram? Yes. Gangaram, let's believe that you didn't know.. ..that Mr. Moti is already married. But had Mr. Moti also forgotten that he is already married? Order. Order. Tell me, Gangaram. Why are you silent? Tell me. What should I say, Advocate? You think. Why don't you go and ask him? Well, Mr. Hari, who told you that Moti is already married? Advocate, then Gangaram visited our house after two-three days. He said that Moti is already married, so you marry off your.. ..daughter to my younger brother Shivram. Then what did you say? - I refused. Why did you have an objection? Advocate, it is not a matter to object.. ..it was a question of my respect. I would have agreed but Shivram's marriage.. ..was already fixed with my friend Sunderlal's daughter. Gangaram, is it true? Sir, it is true. But actually.. I don't want to know anything. Just answer in yes or no to my question. Yes. Your Honour, you know our villages and society very well. Today also if some girl's proposal breaks.. ..after being fixed once, it has a great effect on her parents. They are defamed. Your Honour, in spite of knowing everything.. ..this miscreant has dishonoured two decent men.. ..in the greed of wealth and property. That's all, Your Honour. Mr. Hari, which is the plot that you were going to.. ..give to Gangaram in your daughter's dowry? And which is that debt that you were going to let go? Why? My ancestral land which I had lent to Gangaram to plough. And that compensation amount which.. ..Gangaram had not paid me for last 30 years. You are lying! - Am I lying? That land didn't belong to your ancestors but Gangaram. And that loan is not the tax for tilling.. ..but the money borrowed by mortgaging that land. Objection, Your Honour. It is not a question.. ..but an allegation on the witness. I don't want to say anything else, Your Honour. I know, Your Honour, he doesn't have any question.. ..which reply may prove that Gangaram is guiltless. Just by shouting that it's a lie, the lie can't be proved as truth. The young advocate should know that.. ..it is not a farm but a court. It is not the same to plough and defence. Your Honour, I've already proved the allegations.. ..of robbery and defamation against Gangaram. Now, I want to prove that Gangaram's cousin brother.. ..had placated Mr. Hari's daughter to elope with him. I have a proof that the girl was reached.. ..to Gangaram's brothers in Kolkata. Your Honour, it is possible that Radha was abducted.. ..to take a revenge with Mr. Hari. It is possible that her life is in danger. To know where she is and in which condition.. ..I'd like to call Gangaram's younger brother Shivram to the court. Your Honour, before Shivram is called here.. ..I want to say something to the court. I think, Your Honour, this case is purposely made.. ..to devastate Gangaram's family. So, I request the court to give me some time.. ..so that I can save this unfortunate farmer from the trouble. But Your Honour, how is it possible.. By accepting Mr. Moti's appeal.. ..this case is postponed to the 27th of this month. Sister-in-law, why are you worried? Why are you worrying when brother Moti is here? Sit. Mr. Mahendranath, keeping Mr.Moti's absence in mind the court gives you permission to proceed. Thank you, Your Honour. I knew, Your Honour, that young advocate.. ..won't arrive at the court on time out of shame. Because he is a member of Gangaram's family too. And, Your Honour, Gangaram's reality.. ..has already been revealed to the court. Now I'd like to call Gangaram's younger brother.. ..Shivram at that witness box. Permission granted. Repeat with me. I will speak only the truth. I will speak only the truth. Nothing except the truth. - Nothing except the truth. Isn't it true, Shivram, that Mr.Hari's daughter Radha was with you in Kolkata? Yes, she was. How did Radha reach Kolkata? She had come there with my cousin brother Sukhiya. Shut up! She had not come but she was.. ..brought there forcefully on your encouragement. No, sir. Why will I do this? So that you can exact revenge of your enmity with Mr. Hari. I also have a proof, Shivram, that you thrashed.. ..and committed atrocities against Radha in Kolkata. No, sir. One day in a fit of anger.. Your Honour, both of my brothers will ruin me. Order! Order! Where is Radha now? She got upset and went somewhere. You are lying again. You know where Radha is. You all have hid her so that you can pressurise.. ..Mr. Hari and derive money from him. Now, tell me where is Radha. Shivram, you will have to tell in the court where Radha is. Where is Radha? Radha is here, Your Honour. Move aside. - Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! - Wretched Hari, what have you done? Your Honour, this old lady is disturbing the court. What? Who is this idiot? He is Moti's father-in-law, Grandma. I see. So, both the father-in-laws want to.. ..ruin the lives of both the son-in-laws. Old lady, don't interfere the investigation of the court. Sit quietly. Your Honour, I'll sit if you say. But don't spare him. Get aside, idiot. Order! Order! Yes, Mr. Moti. Your Honour, she is Mr. Hari's daughter Radha. The reply of all the questions of this case. I'd like to appeal the court to give me permission to bring.. ..Radha to the witness box to reveal the truth. Permission granted. Please come. Repeat with me. I will speak only the truth. - I will speak only the truth. Nothing except the truth. - Nothing except the truth. Why? Are you jealous? Radha, did you go to Kolkata willingly.. ..or did anyone take you there forcefully? I had gone there willingly. - Why? My father wanted to marry me off to an old man.. ..in the greed of money. I had gone to commit suicide but brother Sukhiya saved me. And I went to Kolkata with him. Okay, Radha, do you know anything about this land? Yes, Milord. This land belongs to brother Ganga. He mortgaged it to my father and borrowed a loan. Once I had given Rs.10,000 to Shiv to free this land. That was my money, Milord. My grandmother had given me. Yes, Milord. I had given it to her. It is a lie, Your Honour. This girl is lying. She is forced to tell lies. Mr. Mahendranath, the court will decide whether.. ..the witness is telling lies or truth and not you. Proceed, Mr. Moti. Thank you, Your Honour. Radha, do you have any other evidence.. ..which may prove that this land belongs to Gangaram? Yes. - What is it? Take it. What is this? The real documents of Gangaram's land. No! It's a lie. The real document is.. Why did you stop, Mr. Hari? Answer me. Where is the real document? Your Honour, he can't tell. Because he has burned and destroyed the real document. Then what is this? Plain papers, sir. Plain papers? Yes, Your Honour. Like the truth can't be proved a lie.. ..by shouting it is a lie, the truth can't be changed by shouting. The truth is revealed in this way, Your Honour. Any objection, Mr. Mahendranath? No objection, Your Honour. Proceed, Mr. Moti. Your Honour, this is the reality of respectable and cultured Mr. Hari. Respectable advocate has dishonoured.. ..Gangaram and his family. I don't want to repeat all that. But he had said in this very court.. ..that it is not the same to plough and defence. Perhaps he had forgotten that he gets two times meal.. ..only when the land is ploughed. The farmer family he has dishonoured.. ..today.. one boy of that family has become an advocate. I request my respectable advocate.. ..to plough the field once. That's all, Your Honour. Gangaram, the court considers you innocent.. ..and releases you with respect. Sister-in-law! We have won. We have won, Sister-in-law. - Really? We have won the case. Brother Moti is here. Daddy, you are my guru too. Forgive me for my mistake. Mahendra has never lost any case. Today too.. It was my ambition. It was the biggest dream of life. Congratulations. Radha. Radha, please forgive me. - Shiv! Good grief! Your brother-in-law and sister-in-law are standing here.. ..and you are romancing before them? Come on, cover this drape. Hari, you have committed many sins.. ..that's why you are unable to participate in this happy occasion. Now give up your greed and selfishness.. ..and come to Kashi with me. Got it? We will spend the rest of our lives.. ..at Lord Vishwanath's temple there. I seek your permission to go, Brother. Moti, give whatever punishment you like.. ..to your illiterate and rustic brother. But please don't leave me. No, Brother. I will never leave you. I will never leave you, Brother. Gangaram. I had gone blind in the greed of wealth and money. I have made you suffer a lot. Now, forgive me before I go otherwise.. ..my soul will never get peace, Gangaram. I will never get peace. Don't say this, Mr. Hari. This village belongs to you. It is your village. No, Gangaram. The times have changed. The village belongs to the farmers. The village doesn't need Mr. Hari but master. Take, Gangaram. Take it. The documents of the other farmers are kept in the locker. Please return them. Let's go, Mother. "It is the bond of love." "We are bound in a relationship stealthily." "Where will you go? Where will you go, beloved?"
