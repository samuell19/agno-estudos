Notify the FBI. The FBI? Yes, Flanagan, Branagan and Iskovitch. Detectives. Woe is me. Shempeth. Larryeth. Spring is around the corner. We must get the princess back, or we cannot be wed. Quite so. Quite quite. Your Majesty, publicity of the abduction would keep the tourists away from Coleslaw-vania. Let us, your fiddlers three, rescue the fair princess. You're brave men, my fiddlers. Rescue the fair princess, and I shall reward you. Thank you, sire. Ooh! To horse, to horse, we will scour the countryside. Wait, our steed is not shod. Sue has not a shoe. Then we will shoe Sue. For if Sue has no shoe, shoeing Sue we must do. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. Shoe. [IMITATING TRAIN WHISTLE] Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Blacksmith, where art thou? Wait a minute. "Gone to rest under the spreading chestnut tree. Will idge, Blacksmith." Shempeth, get yon fellas and keep the forge red-hot. We'll shoe Sue ourselves. Larryeth, stoke yon fire. I'll help thee. BELLOWS: B.O.! B.O.! B.O.! Whew! Your best friend should tell thee. Shaketh a leg with yon bellows. Faneth me with the breeze from yon bellows lest I suffocate from the heat. Nay, but I cannot. Pump yon bellows, varlet. Pump! See-eth? Giveth it to me. Thou art a lamebrain. Stopeth this nonsense. Hath thou forgotten the princess? Oh, buttoneth up thy lip. Strange. There was water just a second ago. [CHUCKLING] [CHIMING] Maketh haste and get some hot horseshoes from yon forge. Time marcheth on. Take this hammer and beat the shoe. Nay, I have not the heart to beat an innocent shoe. Thou art a dumb cluck. Ooh. [SIZZLING] [YELLING] [HISSING] Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Oh. Ah, ah. You bringeth Sue forward. Larryeth, you helpeth him. LARRY: That's a way, girl. That's a way, girl. That's it. Shempeth, lift the mule's foot and pass it to me. Okayeth. Susie, lift your leg now. Come on, Susie, lift your leg. Don't be stubborn. Come on, Susie. Lift your leg, Susie. [YELLING] Idiot. Thou hast made me shoe the wrong mule. Hold still. Hold still now. Oh! Ow! Oh, oh, oh, oh. I think you didst that on purpose. Quiet. See that? Yes. Oh! Oh. Oh, oh. [SUE MOANING] Letteth a man show you how to shoe Sue. I will fix thee, wise guy. This hammer will hold thy tail down. Yes, sir, smarty cat. Now, giveth me thy foot. Giveth me. Moe! Oh! Whoa. [CRASHING] [ALL GROANING] Where are we? Let's get out of here. Let's find out. [MEN LAUGHING] Quiet, lads. Quiet. We must listen for the signal bell. Then we will push the princess up the ladder into the magician's box. [ALL LAUGHING] So they've got the princess. We gotta do something. But they're heavily armed, and they outnumber us. Let me at 'em. I'll tear 'em limb for limb. Let me at 'em. Well, what's keepin' ya? Me. Go on. Think. Then it is agreed, Your Majesty, that if I recover the Princess Alicia through my magic, I may have her hand in marriage? Yes, yes. Just bring back my daughter unharmed. Your majesty will observe that the box is quite empty. Now then, Your Majesty, I will take my magic robe and with the three magic words: Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Now then, Your Majesty. Now, your majesty, watch yon box closely, and I will perform my magic. I will take yon maiden and saw her in half, and in her stead will appear the princess, completely unharmed. Observe. [SQUEAKING] I got it. I got it. What? What? A terrific headache. Get out, you. Listen, we gotta use straged-- We gotta use-- Strategy. Who's asking you? Ooh! Ooh! Get out of here. Listen, this is what we gotta do. [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] [MEN LAUGHING] Nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah! [YELLING] Fear not, princess. I, Shempeth, shall release thee. Scrameth, princess. Scrameth. [CHUCKLING] Aw, now to quencheth my thirst. Greetings. [YELLING] The princess! The princess is gone! Where's the princess? Take these miserable wretches to the dungeon, and we'll do away with them. Forward! [ALL WHISTLING] Hey, come on. Oh, get out of there. Quick, upeth the ladder. Water, water. Upeth the ladder. MOE: Quiet. SHEMP: I needeth some water. 'Twas a narrow escape.
