ARCADE - BETEL NUT STAND What on earth happened? You are all bloody. What happened? How did you cut yourself? What did you do to your hand? Give me your hand. Ouch. That hurts. Don't touch it. I'm cleaning up your hand. Stop whining. - How did you break the glass? - What glass? The window pane. Do you have nothing better to do with yourself? Rebels of The Neon God JEWELRY STORE HAIR SALON You want a refund? The exams are two months away. Are you switching to another tutorial school? Have you informed your instructor? Have you talked to him? Why don't you go off to class first and I'll have a chat with him. Let's look at this math problem; we have to approach it... from Line T and Line K... Before we solve this problem... let's simplify the question. Now, it should be easier. From the two lines... Line L and Line K... we can determine the coordinates of point A and point B. C'mon, get up. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Lock the door when you leave. Remember to lock the door. Are you interested in buying a car? Here's my business card. Call me if you're interested. Midnight Phone Dating That's my scooter! Hsiao-kang. Hsiao-kang. Where are you going? Why aren't you at the tutorial class? My bike got towed. All right. Hop in the car. Damn. PHONE COMPANY - This is too much for me. - No, it's not. Just eat. We are not there yet. - I hear the fourth floor is haunted. - It is. Where am I? What street is this? Kenang Street. Where are you going? Can I hitch a ride with you? - Where are you going? - West Gate. Hsiao-kang, let's go and catch a movie this afternoon. Then we'll pick up your motorbike after the movie. You might as well skip class this afternoon. I haven't watched a movie for ages. When you were little, your mum and I always took you to the movies. Do you still remember? What's wrong with that guy? He's honking at you. What's wrong with you? You just cut in from the side. You are the one who swerved right, then left. - That's none of your business. - Yes it is. You hit my car. Your car moved over. Well, you turned first and even signaled your light. I was signaling, but I was moving forward. - Show me your license. - My license? Who do you think you are? - You hit my car, you cut me off. - You know darn well yours hit mine. I want the police. Go on, get the police. Get the police. I'm not going to the movies. You better go to class. TUTORIAL SCHOOL PROTECTION FROM THE TEMPLE PRIESTESS Why are you home so late? I was at the Phoenix Temple this afternoon. You know what the priestess once said about Hsiao-kang? She said he is the reincarnated legendary God Norcha. Have you ever heard of God Norcha? Are you listening? You are not feeling well again. Did you hear what I just said? The priestess said your son is the reincarnation of Norcha. No wonder you guys get along so badly. Do you know who Norcha hated the most? His old man, Lee-chin. And see, our family name is Lee as well. You know who Lee-chin is, don't you? He was the celestial king who built a bejewelled tower. The tower was for locking up his son. Can you please stop it? In my opinion... maybe you should build him a temple to worship him. All this stupid talk about this god and that god. Hsiao-kang, why aren't you in bed yet? What are you doing, Hsiao-kang? What are you doing? Stop it. Hsiao-kang, what's wrong with you? Stop scaring us like this. Hsiao-kang, don't scare us like this. Hsiao-kang. Bastard. What brought you here? We were in the neighborhood. - My friend Ah-ping. - I'm Ah-kuei. I'm Ah-ping. - Where are you guys going later? - Ah-ping, what do you think? - The movies. - A movie? Sure, but you have to wait till I get off work at 9. Fine, we'll wait. I'll buy you a drink later. Did you smell her scent? What scent? You mean her armpits? I wouldn't invite her if it was her armpits. Seat her between us, so I can enjoy the movie and her. You've got a lot of nerve. What the hell are you doing? What do you think you are doing? You shouldn't take her. What's the harm anyway? If brothers can share girls, so can friends. She'll come in handy. Dream on. It's an unexpected bonus. - Does it fit? - Sure does. How much is it? I'll offer you 20 percent off. Hey, how do I look? What about 40 percent off? No way, I always gave you 20 percent off. But I'm a regular customer. I don't even offer 20 percent off for our newest selection. - Do you think it's too tight here? - Of course not. It fits you so nicely. Let go of me! Where do you work? At the telephone company, fixing phones. - He's the chairman. - Vice-chairman. Then I could be the First Lady. He works at another job on the side. You mean as a gigolo? Do I look like a gigolo? I'm not the type. Seriously, he fixes vending machines for tissue paper. Do telephone companies sell tissue paper? - Are there people there? - Guess so. Do they go to restrooms and use toilet paper to wipe their bums? All right, knock it off. Let's drink. A drinking game first. What about the towel game? I knew you would pick that one. Hard, hard, hard! Don't fool around. Let's start again. - Hard, hard, hard! - Soft, soft, soft! You drink first. Bottoms up. Again, another round. Hard, hard, hard! Hurry up. - Soft, soft, soft! - Soft, soft, soft! - Hard, hard, hard! - Soft, soft, soft! Wait. - Hard, hard, hard! - You don't even get hard. You don't play, why are you laughing? - You can't get hard. - You can't even "play." Forget it, let's play another game. - Put in $100 each. - What for? Let me show you a real mind boggler. Don't worry, I won't cheat you guys. - I don't need to put any money in. - Bull, why not? "Bull, why not?" Why would I? $300. You can't use your hands, or your feet, or anything else to get it. But if you get it, it's yours. Really? You're not allowed to shake the glass with your hands. - What if I break it? - But that's still using your hands. I know what. Psychic power. That's scary. Once my buddy's girlfriend got it out. - Using what? - She had big boobs. She bumped it, and it came out. Take your time. If you can't figure it out when I come back, the money is mine. You still can't figure it out? I learned this at an odd job once. You've never had an odd job. - You wouldn't know. - I've known you for a long time. How long? "Part-time job." Well, have you figured it out? Here, let me show you. I have just earned... Get lost. That's too easy. Let me demonstrate then. But no hard feelings after that. Watch closely, I'm only going to do it once. - That's too easy! - There goes $100. But I didn't even touch the glass. Hey, are you OK? Hey, you. Hey, get up. Get up. - So what now, Ah-ping? - Just take her home. Sorry, no vacancy. No rooms available. - No rooms at all. - No rooms? But it's not even the weekend. Why don't you try across the street? There's no rooms here. You can't sit there. Don't sit there. You are in the way. Thank you. Please come again. - And their room? - We haven't cleaned it yet. No need to clean it. - I don't need to clean it? - No. How much for the room? - $350. - $350? Wow, she's heavier than a pig. How come this room whirls? It's so wet. Do you smell that? What smell? This room stinks. What are you watching? "Come on, baby!" - "Oh, yes!" - Shut up. Turn the volume down. What are you thinking about? The same as you. Don't you want to do it? Don't tell me you're going to do it. Why, you want me to schedule an appointment? Let's go. - Where? Let's watch. - Let's go. Come on, let's go. The shoe lace. Let me tie this. - I'm telling you to get out. - Okay, okay. You don't need to be so fierce. Hello. Where am I? So this is where you and Ah-ping dumped me! You guys have the gall to take off and dump me here alone. Do you know you got yourself drunk? You were so drunk. How was I supposed to know where you live? Did you guys do anything to me? Did you rape me? Take a look for yourself. Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay? I'm fine. Will you call me again? What for? I guess I might. I have to go home. I'm changing this for you... REFUND - Do you have $50? - No. Do you have $50? The refund is $15,600. Here's $15,700. Count it. Chang, Shiniui is asking what you want for lunch. Anything. 3 caps, 18 pellets. Try it. You have to shoot three at a time. You have a box lunch. I didn't know you were coming. We'll help you eat it. Sure, I'll treat you guys to lunch. - Are you going shopping again? - Want to escort me? He likes the salesgirl. Very funny. Our sizes don't match. Let me order for you. Two black pepper steaks please. Let's have iced dessert. Why should I be the one to go? - What flavor? - I'll have corn. - What about you? - Anything. I'll go ahead and eat. Where are you guys going tonight? Ah-ping and I got a few things to do. Pick me up when I get off work. Don't bring Ah-ping along. Why not? Are you stupid or what? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Your taro iced dessert. We're closing. OPEN MONDAY FROM 2-10 P.M. Excuse me, miss, I'm looking for my son. We don't page students here. But I'm his father. We have an emergency at home. - In that case, what's his name? - Hsiao-kang Lee. I'm sorry, Mr. Lee, but he disenrolled yesterday. - He did? - Yesterday afternoon. That's not possible. He didn't inform you? - Well, thank you. - You are welcome. - Mrs. Lee, there is a call for you. - I'm coming. Well? You know what your precious son did? He quit the tutorial school... and kept the entire $10,000-something refund. How am I supposed to know where he went? You are at home all day. Can't you even keep track of him? I give up on him. There's no point arguing with you. Mr. Yang, there's a call for you. Hello there. My family name is Lin. I'm Ah-kuei Lin. And sir, you are? What's your name, sir? Huang. Are you really? And how old are you? You are? I'm only 20. No, don't worry. That's fine with me I prefer older men anyway. I'm sorry. Can you please wait? What number? Hi there, I'm at work. I work at a roller skating rink. Okay. Okay. - Hi. - Hop on. - Where to? - It's up to you. Sorry, but I already have a date. What's wrong? You are upset about something. Hey, where are you going? Ah-kuei! - Stop following me around. - I want to see who your date is. - You don't believe me? - That's right. You see that guy behind us. Don't just pick up any guy off the street. Ah-kuei, stop it. Don't be silly. Hi, are you waiting for someone? I'm Mei-kuei Lin. You said you wouldn't come. - Then why are you here? - I feel like it. Hey, who is he? That's none of your business. - Leave me alone. - Come on, stop this. - I hate being stood up. - I'm sorry. - That's useless. - What do you want then? - Don't follow me. - I want to. Don't be like this. Leave me alone. Get lost. - What's wrong with you? - Shut up. Ah-kuei! HOTEL Hi, Dad. You actually remembered to come home. So where were you the last few days? You are too much. - You are getting out of hand. - He's not coming in. Don't be so mad. The poor kid is drenched standing out in the rain. - He'll be sick. - Don't you dare open the door for him. HOTEL KENT CORNER STORE Ah-tse. HERE IS NORCHA MOTORCYCLE REPAIR Do you need help? Stop staring. Haven't you seen a bike before? How much to fix the seat? If you just want to replace the seat, it's $900. But to make it like new... the total cost would be more than $3000. It would add up to $4000 or $5000. Where's your key? - The vandal really wrecked your bike. - I wonder what he applied here. Looks like instant glue. You are lighting the wrong end. My stupid luck. When you're unlucky, things never turn out the way you plan. - Let's ask Norcha. - Can you please shut up? Come on, let's go. There are two guys asking for the boss. There are two guys outside. Who? Ask them to have a seat first. So what about last time... Is it these two? I can't remember anything. You can't remember? Fuck, I hired you to watch the store, not to sleep. Stop just daydreaming about men. - How many do you have? - Ten altogether. - They're new? - They are new. - How much did you offer that Lee guy? - $8000. $8000? That's impossible. That's much higher than the market price. Most places offer $5,000 apiece. That's impossible. We're selling you the new model. But these are local products, not imports. You guys should have come earlier. No one will buy at this price. Besides, you have ten. I will, at best, offer you $5,000 a piece for all ten of them. - That's far too low. - Think about it. It's a good deal. Hey, what's up? Someone stole ten pieces from me last night. But, you hired a girl to look after the store. Was it you guys? Come on, how can it be us? Are you absolutely sure it's these two guys? Our salesgirl said it's them. But that's your salesgirl. Let me be the judge here. Were you at Star King on Chungsan Road last night? No, we weren't. Then where did you get these IC boards? At West Gate. We're selling the boards for a friend. What do you think? Why don't you do this? You leave the boards here, and I'll check into the matter with Mr. Lee. If they're really yours, I'll still buy them from you. - No way. - What do you mean "no way"? Leave the boards alone. Leave them here. Just leave the boards. - I'll look into the matter. - You can't do that. Listen. Leave the boards here and I'll inquire. We will clear up the situation. It's not complicated at all. We can talk things out. So you come back tomorrow. Fine. We'll leave the boards but you pay us a $20,000 deposit. You think I'll rip you off? You are lucky I'm not asking you to pay. We really weren't at your store last night. Shut up. Just leave the boards here. I've had this business for many years. I won't rip a few dollars off you kids. Look, listen to me. Just leave the boards here. I promise I'll look into the matter. - Let's get it done in the right way. - Please, it's only $20,000. Shut up. I'm sorry, but these are my friends. - Okay, okay. - Do what the boss says. Who do you think you are? You need a good beating. - Bastard. - What did you say? Sit down! Don't. These kids don't know any better. - Stop there! - Go to hell! Damn! Ah-tse, run. Faster. Stop there! - Don't beat us up! - Stop! What happened to you, Ah-ping? - How did they beat you up like this? - Those jerks! Let me help you up. My foot... I'll carry you. - Where to? - Konan Residential Area. Miss, can you please adjust my shoes? Thank you. Give me your hand. - I need a smoke. - Smoke? Do you feel better? You want a drink? I want a beer. - What? - A beer. But your mouth is all swollen. Give me a girl then. A girl? Get me a girl to hug. Where am I to find a girl for you to hug? Why don't you borrow that one on the wall. Don't rip it. You ever jerk off with that? Is that all your dirty mind can think of? Ah-tse. What happened to your face? Did you get into a fight? Why are you here? Do I have to have a reason for coming? If you are looking for my brother, he's not in. No, I came to see you. Come in. - What happened to Ah-ping? - Keep your voice down. Can you please close the door? What is really going on here? I had the worst luck today. Do you remember the taxi driver? I broke his side mirror. Well, Ah-ping and I happened to get into his taxi. Did he do anything to you guys? No. He probably didn't remember me. But I still feel shitty. I've never had worse luck in my life. I should be the one who feels unlucky. Jerk. I think I'm the unlucky one. Why? Because I met you. I woke up last night all alone in the hotel room. Do you know what that feels like? I've never felt like that in my life. Ah-tse, is it through between us just like that? Is it? Then I'd better go. Ah-kuei. What? Give Ah-ping a hug, okay? Why should I? Ah-ping said he wants a hug from a woman. He's beaten up badly. Can't you give him a hug? It's Ah-kuei. Do you want me to hold you? Here, let me give you a hug. Ah-tse, let's leave this place. Where do you want to go? I don't know. Good afternoon. Is it raining outside? You are all soaked. You didn't bring an umbrella. You'll catch a cold. Have you heard of phone dating before? You have. Let me explain then. Our rate is $250 for three hours plus a free drink. The man will receive a call. A girl will call you to chat over the phone. If you want to get to know each other better... you can then arrange a time and place to meet. Let me briefly introduce you to... Excuse me. Wait a minute. Hello. Yes, yes. I know. I really haven't seen your bag. If I see it, I promise I'll keep it for you. Believe me. I really haven't seen it. English subtitles by: SOFTITLER
