WHAT IS IT, CAPTAIN? THE MEN WHO BROUGHT IN THOSE HORSES WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU. ARE THEY WAITING? YES, SIR. COME ON IN, MEN. MAJOR HAMMOND, THIS IS EDDIE DEAN AND SOAPY JONES. SAVE THE INTRODUCTIONS, THEY'RE OLD FRIENDS OF MINE. HOW ARE YOU?FINE, MAJOR. GOOD OLD SOAPY. ARE YOU STILL KEEPING THINGS CLEAN? YOU LIKE THE JOKES, DON'T YOU, MAJOR? MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME. SOAPY AND I JUST RAN OUT OF HORSES, WE DELIVERED THE LAST OF THE HERD TODAY. AND JUST IN TIME. I'VE LOCATED 300 HEAD OVER NEAR DOW CITY, THE ONLY HERD WITHIN 200 MILES. ARE THEY FOR SALE? HERE'S A LETTER FROM J.C. MORGAN HIMSELF WITH THE QUOTATION-- $30 A HEAD. WE'LL PURCHASE THEM IMMEDIATELY. $9000 ISN'T TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY IF WE CAN ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE RAILROAD WORKERS. YOU'VE GOT SOME TROUBLE? THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY. THE OUTLAWS IN THIS VICINITY ARE WORSE THAN EVER, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE RAILROAD IS THE FOCAL POINT OF THEIR OUTRAGES. EVERY OTHER DAY OR SO THERE ARE RAIDS ON THE EQUIPMENT, THE SUPPLIES, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE LINE IS NO CLOSER TO ITS COMPLETION THAN IT WAS A MONTH AGO. MAYBE SOMEBODY HAS A PERSONAL GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE LINE. MAYBE SOMEBODY REALIZES THAT WITH THE COMING OF THE RAILROAD COMES PEOPLE, AND WITH SOME PEOPLE, COMES LAW. WHATEVER THE REASON, THEY'VE JUST ABOUT BROUGHT THE PROGRESS OF THE RAILROAD TO A STANDSTILL. AND WITHOUT SUFFICIENT MOUNTS, WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GIVE THEM ADEQUATE PROTECTION. THESE MORGAN HORSES ARE THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE SURE LUCKY OLD J.C. SAW FIT TO WRITE YOU. THE SOONER WE CAN GET THOSE HORSES, THE QUICKER THE RAILROAD COMPANY CAN COMPLETE ITS JOB. IT SAYS HERE IF YOU BUY THE HORSES, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE DELIVERY AT THE RANCH AND PAY CASH IN ADVANCE. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN. I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU INSPECT THOSE HORSES, IF YOU FIND THEM ACCEPTABLE, TELL MORGAN HE HAS A SALE. WHEN WE HEAR FROM YOU, THE CAPTAIN WILL DRAW THE NECESSARY MONEY, SEND IT TO YOU, AND YOU CAN CLOSE THE DEAL. YOU'D MAKE A PRETTY FAIR HORSE TRADER YOURSELF, MAJOR. HA HA! I HOPE SO. YAHOO! YAHOO! TWO BITS TO A HEN'S TOOTH HE'LL DO IT AGAIN. CUT HIM LOOSE. I TOLD YA-- IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME WHICH ONE OF YA'S GONNA GET BROKE. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY. YOU MEAN THAT BRONCO, OR ARE YOU SPEAKING OF YOURSELF? I MEAN HIM, OF COURSE. AND NONE OF YOUR WISECRACKS. YOU AIN'T DONE HIM A BIT OF GOOD. HE'S AS WILD AS EVER. JUST GIVE ME TIME, I'LL CORRAL HIM. YOU AIN'T THE HAND WITH HORSES YOUR FATHER WAS. I ADMIT I MAY NOT BE AS GOOD AT BREAKIN' 'EM, BUT I'VE GOT SOME NEW IDEAS ABOUT SELLIN' THEM THAT MIGHT WORK OUT. JENNY, IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET ANYWHERE SIGNING YOUR NAME "J.C." AND MAKING PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE DEALING WITH A MAN, YOU'RE JUST PLAIN LOCO. WELL, LISTEN, TENNESSEE, THERE ISN'T A MAN ALIVE WHO WOULD TRADE HORSES WITH ME WITHOUT TRYIN' TO OUTSMART ME IF HE KNEW HE WAS DEALING WITH A WOMAN. OH, WHOEVER HEARD OF A WOMAN HORSE TRADER? I TELL YA, IT'S SACRILEGE! AW, THAT'S WHAT ALL YOU MEN SAY. POP LEFT ME A GOOD RANCH AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT. THIS IS A MAN'S WORLD, AND I'M GOING TO TREAT IT ACCORDINGLY. I TELL YA, JENNY, YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE. AND STOP CALLING ME JENNY! MY NAME HAPPENS TO BE JENNIFER COLLETTA, AND IF I CHOOSE TO BE CALLED J.C., THAT'S MY BUSINESS. YOU'RE MY RANCH FOREMAN, NOT MY BOSS. ALL RIGHT, J.C. BUT I WAS YOUR FATHER'S FOREMAN, TOO, AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF FIRE HE HAD, I WOULDN'T BE STICKIN' AROUND. THANKS, TENNESSEE. SAY, HOW ABOUT AMBLIN' ON DOWN TO THE MAILBOX-- THOSE REPLIES OUGHTA BE COMIN' IN. SURE THING...J.C. GO ON. Tennessee: HEY, TUCSON. YOU MIND AMBLIN' DOWN TO THE MAILBOX? THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING. NO, NOT AT ALL. SENORA? SI, SENOR. MIND AMBLIN' DOWN TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY MAIL? UNE MOMENTO, SENOR. OKAY. SENORITA. YES? WOULD YOU DO ME A BIG FAVOR? WHAT'S THAT? I HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO-- PLEASE BRING IN THE MAIL. ALL RIGHT. Eddie: BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS. WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR J.C. MORGAN. WELL, I'M J.C. MORGAN. IF IT'S A JOB YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR, I'M SORRY, I HAVE ALL THE COWBOYS I NEED RIGHT NOW. WE'RE LOOKING FOR J.C. MORGAN THE HORSE TRADER. I'M THE HORSE TRADER, AND I'M ALSO J.C. MORGAN. AH, NOW I SEE JUST AS CLEAR AS WATER-- WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MUD ADDED. IF YOU'RE REALLY WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE, WE'VE COME TO INSPECT YOUR HORSES FOR THE ARMY. YOU WHAT? OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS! I'VE BEEN WAITING EVERY DAY FOR A LETTER FROM MAJOR HAMMOND. JUST A MINUTE. TENNESSEE! HEY, TENNESSEE! COME HERE! NOW WHAT IN TARNATION HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR BONNET? WE'VE SOLD THE HORSES AND AT THE PRICE I QUOTED. WELL, I DECLARE, YOU SURE GOT A HEAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS. JUST LIKE YOUR OLD MAN. BUT WE STILL GOT PLENTY OF WORK TO DO. AS SOON AS I GET THAT MONEY, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU AND ALL THE BOYS TO DOW CITY FOR A BIG CELEBRATION! AH AH--THERE'S JUST ONE HITCH. WHAT'S THAT? THE MAJOR'S PRETTY FUSSY, AND WE'LL HAVE TO PASS ON EVERY HEAD OF THE HERD, I'M NOT WORRIED, I'VE GOT THE GREATEST HORSES IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN STAY IN THE MAIN BUNKHOUSE WITH THE REST OF THE HANDS. HEY, SENORA! PUT ON A COUPLE MORE HELPINGS-- WE'VE GOT COMPANY FOR SUPPER. SI, SI, J.C. ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL? HA HA! HELLO, TUCSON. HOWDY, MARINO. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO TOWN? I GOT SOME BAD NEWS. I JUST LEARNED THAT THE ARMY'S GONNA BUY THE MORGAN HORSES. THAT IS BAD. IF THEY DO THAT, JOE, YOUR FREIGHT LINE WILL BE FORCED RIGHT OUT OF BUSINESS. WON'T BE SO GOOD FOR YOU EITHER, CLEM. YOU KNOW, TRAINS CARRY PEOPLE AS WELL AS FREIGHT. IT'LL BE REAL COMPETITION FOR YOUR STAGECOACH LINE. AT LEAST YOU TWO OWN THE DOW SALOON, PRETTY FANCY PLACE TO FALL BACK ON. AND WITH THE NEW PEOPLE, MAKE IT KINDA PROSPEROUS. THE COMING OF TOO MANY PEOPLE ALWAYS BRINGS LAW AND ORDER, CHURCHES, SCHOOLS, AND A LOT OF CRACKPOTS AGAINST GAMBLING AND DRINKING! NO, TUCSON, YOU'RE ALL WRONG-- THE COMING OF THE RAILROAD WILL BE DISASTROUS FOR US. THEN WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN. I ALMOST FORGOT YOU TWO COULDN'T MAKE AN HONEST LIVING. YOU'RE NOT BEING PAID TO BE SMART-- JUST DO AS YOU'RE TOLD. WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THOSE HORSES OUT OF THEIR HANDS, AND WE DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT. THAT REMINDS ME... AS THE POSTMASTER, I'M STILL GETTING THESE NOTICES FROM THE STATE. PUT IT AWAY--THE PICTURE DOESN'T DO ME JUSTICE. YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF HELP. I'LL CALL ON 'EM WHEN I NEED 'EM. HANK, GIMME A DRINK. MISS MORGAN, WE'VE INSPECTED ALL THE HORSES, AND I'VE WRITTEN TO THE MAJOR ASKING HIM TO SEND YOUR MONEY RIGHT AWAY. THAT'S MIGHTY NICE OF YA. I GUESS YOU'LL BE HITTIN' THE TRAIL PRETTY SOON. YEP. WE'LL BE LEAVIN' IN THE MORNING. YOUR BOYS ARE GIVING A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER FOR SOAPY AND I TONIGHT. I, UH, HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO JOIN US. WELL, THANKS, I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT. HERE, LET ME DO IT. HERE WE WAS, ME AND COLONEL CUSTER, COOPED UP IN A BOX CANYON WITH 25,000 INDIANS A-BEARIN' DOWN ON US. WE WAS DOWN TO OUR LAST ROUND OF AMMUNITION. THE COLONEL GOT SO DARN MAD, HE STOMPED HIS FOOT, HE CAUSED AN EARTHQUAKE. THE GROUND OPENED UP AND SWALLOWED EVERY ONE OF THEM INDIANS QUICKER THAN A WHISTLE, AND WE WALKED OUT OF THERE WITH JUST ENOUGH BULLETS TO SHOOT OURSELVES A COUPLE OF RABBITS FOR SUPPER. YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING? YEAH? EDDIE? LET'S TELL HIM WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ME IN OKLAHOMA.

SWIM 'EM DOWN THE RIVER TO THE FORK AND THEN HEAD 'EM OFF INTO LOST CANYON. BEAUTIFH OF HORSES, TUCSON. SURE LUCKY THERE AIN'T NO BRANDS ON 'EM. WE COUL A#S 'EM OFFACROSS THE BORDER ANM$SELVES& &ELTHE BOYS AND IX [. FOLLOWED THE TRACKS AS FAR AS WE COULD AND LOST 'EM AT THE RIVER. THOSE HORSES WERE JUST LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK. THEY REPRESENTED A GENERATION OF CARE AND BREEDING, AND NOW, FOR WHAT? ONLY TO HAVE THEM STOLEN BY A BAND OF OUTLAWS FROM THAT LAWLESS HOLE OF DOW CITY! WE AIN'T GOT ANY PROOF THAT IT WAS THEM HOMBRES THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. WE KNOW THIS MUCH-- IT'S A LAWLESS HOLE, AND NO GOOD MEN HANG OUT WHERE THERE'S NO LAW. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE, BUT THERE'S NOTHIN' WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. UNLESS THE CITIZENS BAND TOGETHER AND ELECT A PEACE OFFICER. WELL, THERE'S ONE THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. WHEN THOSE ARMY MEN GET HERE TOMORROW, I'M GOING TO APPEAL TO THEM FOR HELP. I'M GOING TO START AN INVESTIGATION OF THAT TOWN AND KNOW THE REASON WHY! SOAPY AND I HAVE DECIDED TO STICK AROUND A WHILE LONGER. SO MUCH IS HAPPENING, YOU MIGHT NEED US. THANKS A LOT. I TOLD YOU WE'D NEVER GET BY WITH STEALING THOSE HORSES. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? AN ARMY ATTACHMENT IS ON ITS WAY HERE TO BUY THEM, AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE, MISS MORGAN'S GONNA DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION. WHY, THAT'S THE SAME AS MARTIAL LAW-- THAT'S AWFUL-- IT'S TERRIBLE! DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD. NO LAW'S EVER DARED COME INTO THIS PART OF THE TERRITORY. WE'VE HANDLED IT BEFORE, WE CAN STILL HANDLE IT. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE CARRYING? I GUESS ABOUT $9,000. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE JOB OF GETTING THAT MONEY AND KEEPING THEM OUT OF HERE. WE CAN'T AFFORD AN INVESTIGATION TILL WE GET RID OF THOSE HORSES. THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH JOB, AND IF WE MISS, WE'RE ASKIN' TROUBLE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU'RE IN THIS JUST AS MUCH AS WE ARE. DO AS I SAY AND I'LL GET US ALL OUT OF IT. COME ON, TRIGGER. WE'VE GOT SOME MEN TO ROUND UP FOR A REAL FIGHT. Tucson: THERE'S THEIR CAMP-- WE'RE IN A PERFECT SPOT FOR IT. WHEN YOUR MEN DIDN'T SHOW UP AS PLANNED, I WENT OUT ON THE TRAIL HOPING TO MEET UP WITH THEM, AND I FOUND THEIR LAST CAMPFIRE AND NOTIFIED CAPTAIN ROGERS. THERE WASN'T A MAN IN THE WHOLE DETACHMENT THAT ESCAPED, SIR. NO EVIDENCE AT ALL-- FIRE COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE CAMP. DO YOU SUPPOSE THE APACHE INDIANS IN THAT AREA STAGED A WAR OF THEIR OWN? DEFINITELY NOT. THESE RAIDERS WERE WHITE MEN. INDIANS WOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED TO TAKE THE GOLD THAT YOU WERE SENDING FOR THE MORGAN HORSES. THERE WASN'T A SIGN OF IT IN THE ASHES. I'M CONVINCED THE MOTIVE WAS OUT-AND-OUT ROBBERY. PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE FUGITIVES THAT HIDE OUT IN AND AROUND DOW CITY. SHALL I PLACE THE TOWN UNDER MARTIAL LAW AND PLACE SOME OF OUR TROOPS THERE? NO--IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE CAN'T SPARE THE MEN. SECONDLY, AN OPEN INVESTIGATION WOULD PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD AND THEY'D SCATTER LIKE QUAIL. WE WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE WE EVEN GOT STARTED. BUT I HAVE A LITTLE IDEA OF MY OWN THAT MIGHT WORK OUT. I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT THE MAJOR SENT WORD THAT THE ARMY CAN'T SEE ITS WAY CLEAR TO HAVING AN INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME. SEEMS LIKE WE'RE JUST ABOUT LICKED. NO HORSES, NO MONEY, NO PROTECTION-- I'M BEGINNIN' TO FEAR FOR OUR VERY LIVES. SENORITAMORGAN, I THINK IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR ME BACK IN SPAIN, WHERE ALL I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS THE BULL IN THE BULL RING. YOUR OTHER RANCH HANDS ARE ABOUT READY TO WALK OFF, BUT TENNESSEE AND I ARE WILLING TO STICK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT ALL OF YOU. AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT THIS OUT IF YOU'LL HELP ME. WHADDYA MEAN, FIGHT IT OUT? WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO MAKE THE INITIAL MOVE TO ELECT A PEACE OFFICER IN DOW CITY. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! IT'D BE A CINCH TO GET THE VOTES OF THE CITIZENS, BUT WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU GET TO TAKE THE JOB? YOU. UH--ME?! OOOH, NO. NOT FOR THE WILDEST STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. BUT I CAN'T BE THE CONSTABLE, SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE IT FOR ME. BUT I DON'T KNOW A DURNED THING ABOUT LAW. YOU WILL AFTER YOU FINISH READING THIS LAW BOOK. THAT MORGAN GIRL IS GOING THROUGH WITH HER PLANS. SHE'S ALREADY GOT THE VOTE OF EVERY CITIZEN IN TOWN TO MAKE TENNESSEE THE CONSTABLE. SO WHAT? SHE HASN'T GOT CLEM OR ME TO BACK HER UP, EVERYBODY KNOWS WE RUN THIS TOWN. BUT SHE'S DETERMINED THERE'S GONNA BE AN INVESTIGATION, TELLING EVERYBODY IT'S STARTING RIGHT HERE AT THE DOW SALOON. HEY, BOB. WE JUST LEARNED SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW. DON'T TELL ME THAT GALS' GOT YOU SCARED, TOO. NAH, IT AIN'T THAT. WE JUST HEARD THAT WHISTLIN' SAM GOT WIND OF THE JOB YOU PULLED AND IS HEADIN' THIS WAY. WHO'S WHISTLIN' SAM? EVERYBODY'S HEARD OF HIM. HE'S KNOWN AS THE TOUGHEST GUNSLINGER IN THE TERRITORY. THEY SAY HE'S GOT A BAD TEMPER. SENSE OF HUMOR, TOO. HE LIKES TO SHOOT A MAN IN HIS ADAM'S APPLE, JUST TO SEE HIS HEAD WOBBLE BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND. WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE? I HEARD HE WASN'T TOO BAD LOOKIN'. BUT ALWAYS WITH BLOOD IN HIS EYE, AND HE HAS A MANIA FOR WHISTLING, ALWAYS WHISTLING, ESPECIALLY JUST BEFORE HE GETS READY TO MURDER SOMEBODY. [ whistling ] IT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT-- ALWAYS RIDES A BLACK HORSE. WHY THAT'S THE HOMBRE WHO'S BEEN POSING AS THE INSPECTOR OUT AT THE MORGAN RANCH. PRETTY SMART OPERATOR. PROBABLY FIGURED ON GETTING HIMSELF THE HORSES, ONLY WE BEAT HIM TO IT. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT? TAKE HIM INTO THE GANG, MAKE HIM A DEAL TO STRING ALONG WITH US. GOOD IDEA--BETTER TO HAVE HIM FOR US THAN AGAINST US. WELL, COUNT ME OUT OF THIS. [ whistling ] WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, MEN? GIMME A GREAT, BIG, LONG, TALL SNORT. WHAT BRAND? MAKE IT ICE WATER. THAT GOES FOR ME, TOO. WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY, THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD LIKE IT. AAH. WELL? TO YOU. TO ME. AAH! YOU'RE STRANGERS IN THESE PARTS, AREN'T YOU? SORT OF. FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS, WE'RE GONNA LIKE IT AROUND HERE. EEE-YOW! WHERE YOU FROM? DOWN AROUND THE BORDER. ANY OBJECTIONS? NO, ON THE CONTRARY-- WE HEARD YOU WERE HEADING THIS WAY, WE'VE BEEN KIND OF EXPECTING YOU, SAM. SAM? THE NAME'S EDDIE, EDDIE DEAN. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT MAY BE NOW. BUT LET'S YOU AND I QUIT FOOLING EACH OTHER. WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE WHISTLING SAM, AND I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO CUT YOU IN WITH THE BOYS. WE TRY TO GET ALONG TOGETHER HERE, THERE'S PLENTY OF PICKIN'S FOR EVERYBODY. BUT WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. COME ON OVER AND MEET THE BOYS. He thinks you're that no-good polecat Whistlin' Sam. Is that bad? It is if he shows up. He won't, he's in the pen. I heard he just got out. At any rate, he's not around here. Might as well play ball, we might learn something. Not me, I ain't hankerin' for no learnin' that bad. Come on, we ain't got nothin' to lose. Maybe you haven't but I have. TENNESSEE, YOU MAKE A WONDERFUL-LOOKING LAWMAN. YEAH, I DO AT THAT. AND YOU'RE MAKING ME THE HAPPIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD. THERE WASN'T ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOUR FATHER, THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO. HERE'S YOUR BOOK... YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. YEAH... I KNOW WHAT TO DO. Tennessee: I WOULD LIKE IT QUIET, PLEASE. TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEW CONSTABLE, MEN. I HEARD THERE WAS AN ILL WIND BLOWING, BUT I HARDLY EXPECTED IT TO BLOW IN HERE. [ laughter ] I SAID QUIET! SOME OF YOU MEN'LL BE LAUGHIN' ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR FACE WHEN I GET THROUGH WITH YOU. AS YOU ALL KNOW, A DETAILED CAVALRY WAS ROBBED AND THEN MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD. I'M HERE TO INVESTIGATE IT. THE JUDICIAL CODE SAYS IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE, THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME EVIDENCE. IN ORDER TO GET EVIDENCE, I'VE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU MEN. LISTEN TO HIM, SOUND LIKE HE'S TAKING THIS JOB SERIOUSLY. HE SOUNDS LIKE HE SWALLOWED THE DICTIONARY. LIKE OR NOT, I'M GONNA QUESTION EVERY MAN OF YOU ONE AT A TIME. AND THE MAN OR MEN WHO AIN'T GOT AN ALIBI AS TO HIS WHEREABOUTS ON THE NIGHT OF THE 5TH, IS COMIN' WITH ME TO THE JAIL, AND THE ALIBI'S GOTTA BE ONE THAT I BELIEVE. I'LL START WITH YOU. YOU AIN'T STARTIN' WITH ME, I'M JUST LEAVIN'. OH, NO YOU AIN'T. IN ORDER TO KEEP WITHIN THE LAW, YOU GOTTA ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. WAIT A MINUTE, MEN. WE WERE JUST GONNA TEACH THE OLD BOY A LESSON. HELP HIM UP, SOAPY. WHY, YOU-- YOU WOULD HIT ME WHEN I WASN'T LOOKIN'. YOU UNGRATEFUL OLD GOAT, AND ME TRYIN' TO HELP YA-- I OUGHTA PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE-- HOLD IT, SOAPY. DON'T YOU THINK HE'S A LITTLE OUTNUMBERED? I DON'T LIKE TO SEE A MAN TAKIN' UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. THAT'S KIND OF A FUNNY WAY FOR YOU TO TALK. BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME-- YOU'RE ONE OF THE GANG NOW. I'M NOT TAKIN' SIDES WITH ANYONE, YET. NOT TILL I'VE HAD A LOOK AROUND TOWN. MEANTIME, I'LL SHOW YA HOW TO GET RID OF THE CONSTABLE. COME ON, YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE TALK. THERE'S ONE OF THE SMOOTHEST OPERATORS I'VE EVER SEEN WORK. YOU DON'T THINK HE'D LINE UP WITH THE LAW AGAINST US, DO YOU? WITH HIS REPUTATION? HE COULDN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT. THAT'S BETTER. ACCORDIN' TO THIS BOOK, I CAN ARREST ALL THOSE MEN FOR INTERFERIN' WITH PROCEDIN' OF THE LAW. YOU'D BE WASTIN' YOUR TIME, THIS JAIL WOULDN'T HOLD 'EM. RIGHT...PRETTY DISCOURAGIN'. WHAT I NEED ARE SOME GOOD MEN TO HELP ME ENFORCE THE LAW. SAY, DON'T SUPPOSE YOU TWO WOULD LEND ME A HAND? OH, NO, WE'RE HORSE TRADERS. SORT OF TRAVELING HORSE TRADERS. YEAH, AND WHAT WE LIKE MOST IS THE TRAVELIN' PART. GO, EDDIE. DON'T MOVE. TENNESSEE, YOU DID THE WRONG THING BY ASKIN' 'EM TO JOIN YA... BUT YOU DID THE RIGHT THING BY BRINGIN' 'EM HERE. HOW'S THAT? YOU AND I WERE TAKEN ON A LONG BUGGY RIDE. BUT THE TRIP'S OVER NOW-- THESE MEN DON'T WORK FOR THE MAJOR, THEY'RE OUTLAWS, AND THEY'RE WANTED IN EVERY STATE OF THE UNION. FOUND OUT ABOUT 'EM BY TUCSON. IS THAT SO? YOU CAN HOLSTER YOUR GUN, MISS MORGAN. MY PARTNER AND I DON'T PICK ON LAWMEN... AND LADIES. I'LL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT. TENNESSEE, LOCK THESE MEN UP. MAYBE IF THEY STAY IN JAIL LONG ENOUGH, THEY'LL OPEN UP ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HORSES. AND THEY MIGHT EVEN REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE MEN. IF YOU'LL LISTEN FOR A SECOND, I'D BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE WITH YOU. KEEP TALKING. WELL, I'VE GOT AN IDEA THAT MIGHT WORK OUT. YOU SEE, I'M NOT REALLY WANTED, IT'S SORT OF A MISTAKEN IDENTITY. I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT. I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, HE WOULDN'T HARM A FLY. NOBODY ASKED YOU. NOW, WHAT WAS THIS IDEA YOU HAD TO SPRING? I SORT OF FIGURED THAT AS LONG AS THOSE MEN THINK I'M AN OUTLAW AND WANTED ME TO JOIN UP WITH 'EM, IT'D BE EASIER TO LEARN SOMETHING IF WE LET 'EM KEEP THINKING THAT WAY. YOU MEAN YOU'RE WILLING TO PITCH IN AND HELP US OUT? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PROVE WHAT YOU'VE SAID, ON ONE CONDITION. AND WHAT IS THAT? THAT YOU STAY OUT AT MY RANCH, AND YOU ONLY GO AND COME WITH MY PERMISSION. OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT... AW, GO ON, EDDIE. YOU STRIKE A HARD BARGAIN, MISS MORGAN... BUT I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT ACCEPT. Tucson: LOSE SOMETHIN'? NOPE. THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOUR HEADQUARTERS ARE IN THE MAIN BUNKHOUSE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, TUCSON, SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT UP, YOUR FACE IS STRANGELY FAMILIAR-- SEEMS I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE, JUST UNDER THE WORD "WANTED". I'VE HEARD OF YOUR REPUTATION TOO, SAM, THAT KIND OF MAKES US LIKE BIRDS OF A FEATHER. WELL, IN ORDER FOR US TO STICK TOGETHER, YOU'LL HAVE TO CUT ME IN ON THAT LAST JOB YOU PULLED-- THE ONE THAT NETTED THE $9000. WELL, YOU'RE WRONG, I'M GOIN' STRAIGHT NOW. THERE NEVER WAS A BLACKBIRD THAT TURNED INTO A CANARY. BUT IF WHAT YOU SAY IS REALLY TRUE, YOU WON'T MIND IF I LOOK AROUND A LITTLE. WHERE'S THE MONEY? WHY DON'T YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS? YOU DON'T DARE PULL THAT TRIGGER-- BE A LITTLE HARD TO EXPLAIN TO MISS MORGAN. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG-- SHE'S WISE TO YOUR REPUTATION, AND SHE'D BELIEVE ANYTHING I'D TELL HER. [ gunshot ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, AND I CARE LESS, BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. I'LL NEVER INTERFERE IN A FIGHT IF IT'S FAIR, AND I'LL TAKE MY HAT OFF TO THE WINNER, BUT WHEN A FELLA RESORTS TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHY, I'D JUST AS SOON SEE HIM STRUNG UP. COME ON, TUCSON. BUT IT WAS HIS GUN, I WAS JUST UNLOADIN' IT. TOO BAD YOU WASN'T RELOADIN' IT. I KNEW YOU WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FENCE. HMM...BAD BRUISE. I'LL FIX IT FOR YA. TENNESSEE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE TROUBLE BETWEEN YOU AND TUCSON YESTERDAY. SOMETIMES TENNESSEE TALKS TOO MUCH. IT'S TOO BAD A SWEET DISH LIKE JENNY FOOLS ALONG WITH THAT NO-GOOD TUCSON. WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER YOU FOUND THE SADDLEBAGS IN HIS ROOM? BECAUSE I'M NOT A SQUEALER. BESIDES, HE'S ONLY THE SMALLFRY. CRACKIN' DOWN ON HIM WOULD ONLY TIP THE BIG BOYS WE'RE AFTER 'EM. NO, WE BETTER LET THINGS JUST DRIFT ALONG. SOMETIMES THINGS CAN DRIFT TOO FAR, EDDIE. HELLO, TUCSON, LONG TIME, NO SEE. FIRST CHANCE I'VE HAD TO GET IN. I'VE GOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU. YEAH, WE'VE GOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU. LET'S GO UPSTAIRS WHERE WE CAN TALK. THE FELLA WE THOUGHT WAS WHISTLIN' SAM AIN'T HIM AT ALL. NO? HOW'D YOU FIND THAT OUT? WELL, SAM JUST ARRIVED. TUCSON, MEET SAM WADE, GENERALLY KNOWN AS WHISTLING SAM. THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS JUST TELLIN' THE BOSS HERE WHAT A MISTAKE HE MADE. THAT DEAN'S NOTHIN' BUT A BRONC BUSTER. FUNNY THING ABOUT HIM, THE WAY HE'S ALWAYS SNOOPING AROUND AND MAKING TROUBLE. SEEMS HE KIND OF WORKS ON THE SIDE OF THE LAW, INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ALREADY SENT ME TO THE PEN TWICE. THEN WE SHOULD CLEAR OUT OF HERE. IF WE RUN, THAT'S THE SAME AS SIGNING A CONFESSION. HE'S GOT NOTHING ON US. YEAH, HE FOUND THAT ARMY SADDLEBAG IN MY BUNK. I TOLD YOU TO BURN THAT UP! HE FOUND IT BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE. LET'S CLEAR OUT OF HERE BEFORE HE THROWS US ALL IN THE PEN. I OWN THE FREIGHTLINE AND THE SALOON-- I CAN'T AFFORD TO RUN. THEN GIVE ME THAT SHARE OF THE ARMY MONEY, BECAUSE I'M READY TO MAKE MYSELF SCARCE. I'LL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND. YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO THIS JAM, YOU GET YOURSELF OUT OF IT. AND YOU DON'T GET YOUR CUT TILL THE JOB'S FINISHED, AND YOUR JOB AIN'T FINISHED TILL YOU RUN THAT LAW DOG OUT OF THIS TOWN. MARINO'S UPSTAIRS. YOU MEN JUST HAD THE CONSTABLE AS YOUR GUEST. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I SAW HIM OUT THERE ON THE LANDING. IT'S TOO LATE, HE'S GONE. THINK HE HEARD WHAT WE SAID? THERE'S NO DOUBT-- HE'S IN ON IT. AND NO DOUBT HE'S ON HIS WAY TO ENLITRJGHTEN DEAN. JUST THE JOB FOR YOU, SAM. [ whistling ] [ gunshot ] HELLO, BOY-- WHERE'S TENNESSEE? IS HE IN TROUBLE? I... TAKE IT EASY, TENNESSEE, I'LL GET YOU TO A DOCTOR. IT'S NO USE... I'M HIT PRETTY HARD.

HE LEFT US THE ROLLING HILLS OF THE WEST, WHICH HE LOVED SO DEARLY, THE GLORIOUS SUNRISE, AND THE MAGNIFICENT SUNSET OF EACH NEW DAY. HE LEFT US THE MEMORY OF A COURAGEOUS SPIRIT, UNDAUNTED BY TRIALS AND HARDSHIPS. HE LEFT US HIS LOVE TO ENJOY AND SHARE WITH OUR FELLOW MAN.

SEE YA OUTSIDE. EDDIE, YOU HAVEN'T A CHANCE. IF IT'S TRUE ABOUT WHISTLING SAM AND HIS GANG JOINING UP WITH MARINO, YOU'D BE OUTNUMBERED 20 TO 1. WHAT DO YOU CARE? OH, I FEEL SO COMPLETELY HELPLESS. FIRST IT WAS DAD, AND NOW TENNESSEE. IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO YOU, I'D BE COMPLETELY LOST. YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? YOU'RE BEING LIKE THIS IS AWFULLY UNBECOMING TO YOU.

YOU ARE GOING OUTSIDE, BUT YOU'RE GOING WITHOUT SAM, AND YOU'RE GOING FEET FIRST. YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. THERE'S NO ONE TO STOP US. AND AS FAR AS THE LAW IS CONCERNED, IT'S ON OUR SIDE NOW. KENNSIGNTON HERE HAS JUST BEEN MADE OUR NEW CONSTABLE. AND ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN TESTIMONY, YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON WITH TENNESSEE BEFORE HE WAS KILLED, AND ACCORDING TO THE CORONER'S INQUEST, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MURDERED HIM. YOU'RE PRETTY SMART, MARINO, YOU'VE TO ALL THE ANSWERS. NOW, DO YOU MIND TELLING ME HOW YOU FIGURE TO WORK IT? NO, NOT AT ALL. YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO MAKE A GETAWAY, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT A BULLET THROUGH YOU TO STOP YOU. THAT GOES FOR YOUR PAL, TOO. NOW START WALKING FOR THAT DOOR. THIS IS ONE TIME YOUR TIMING WAS ALL WRONG. Marino: THE LIGHTS! THE LIGHTS! QUICK, YOU MEN, GET AFTER 'EM! AND REMEMBER-- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KILL 'EM ON SIGHT! HEY! WAIT FOR ME! WHOA! THAT'S THE LAST PLACE THEY'D LOOK FOR US. HOW COME? LOOK. THOSE ARE THE LONG MISSIN' MORGAN HORSES. HOW'D THEY GET THERE? I PUT 'EM THERE. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR HEAD, OR ARE YOU ASKING FOR A BUNK IN THE HOOSEGOW? DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A REFORMED DRUNKARD? ALL THE WAY OR NOTHING. I CAN GET YOU LENIENCY FOR THIS CONFESSION, BUT I CAN'T PROMISE TO GET YOU COMPLETELY OUT OF IT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME. ANOTHER THING-- WOULD YOU MIND TELLIN' US WHY THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART? OH, I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I GOT TIRED OF MARINO HOLDING THAT WANTED SIGN OVER MY HEAD. OR MAYBE IT'S WHAT THEY DID TO POOR OLD TENNESSEE. OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT PRAYER YOU SAID AT HIS GRAVE. MAYBE IT WAS JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE'VE GOT TO GET THOSE HORSES OUT OF HERE. WE'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THE PASS-- THAT'S WHERE MARINO'S MEN WILL BE WAITING FOR US. THEN WE'LL DRIVE 'EM THROUGH TOWN. WE'LL NEED SOME HELP WHEN WE HIT THE FLATS. I'LL GO BACK TO THE RANCH AND GET THE BOYS TO HELP US OUT. YOU TWO STAY HERE AND WATCH THAT PASS, SEE THAT NOBODY GETS THROUGH. THE REST OF YOU, COME WITH ME. WE LOST 'EM-- THEY SHOW UP HERE YET? WE AIN'T SEEN HIDE NOR HAIR OF 'EM. THEY'VE GOT THE HERD! THEY'VE OUT SMARTED US. WE'LL NEVER STOP THOSE HORSES NOW, BUT WE CAN STOP THEM. MIX IT UP, MEN! [ gun empty ] WELL, LOOKS LIKE I TOOK CARE OF THE WHOLE CABOODLE. SOON AS WE GET THESE HOMBRES LOCKED UP, WE GOT ONE MORE JOB TO DO BEFORE WE'RE THROUGH. WELL, LET'S D-D-D-DO IT IN A HURRY. COME ON, EDDIE. THEY WON'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
