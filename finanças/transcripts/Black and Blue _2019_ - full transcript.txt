Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from the flight deck. We're cruising at 37,000 feet, and we just passed over the coast. We'll be beginning our descent in about 30 minutes. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America. Copy, 45. Hey! What's up? Huh? - Up against the wall. - What's the problem? Up... against... the wall! Hey, take it easy, all right? Against the wall! Spread your legs. Spread 'em! What are you doing in my neighborhood? - I live here, all right? - Yo. Yo. Yo. She's blue. Sorry about that. We're looking for someone that matches your description. You know how it is. Yeah, I know how it is. You must be new. Have a nice day. Rough morning there, slugger? Yeah, you don't know the half. This hasn't been the friendliest of homecomings. Oh, yeah? Come on, cheer up. Every day on God's green earth is a great day. Especially when you carry a gun and you got a bulletproof vest. Hey. You done primping? Can we go? Hang on a second. See? Now I'm ready. Still so hard to see it like this. These all used to be homes. Yeah, nature can be a real bitch. Mm. Kingston Manor. Just wondering who still lives there. Bad people. No, not all of them. I remember a lot of good families just, you know, stuck in an unfortunate situation. Five-0. Five-0! If they were unfortunate before, they're straight-up screwed now. You don't ever want to get caught in there. Girl, you've been gone a long time. We don't even respond to calls from in there anymore. Not unless there's a blue in trouble. All right, I need a coffee. You're black and sweet, right? - That's gonna get old, Kev. - No. No, you're gonna learn to love it. You'll see. Finally. You here about the break-in? Uh, actually, no. Don't even worry about it. Called you guys over 24 hours ago. Officers have been charged with stealing evidence, filing false police reports and extortion. The New Orleans DA worked with Internal Affairs to build their case. Details are still under wraps while the investigation is ongoing. The DA assures us that there are more arrests to come. Hey. Can you do any tricks on that thing? Hmm? I didn't steal it or nothing. I never said you did. How long you had it? A couple years. - Couple years? - Jamal, get your ass here. Shit, man. Talking to the goddamn police. Jamal! Did you not hear me say get your ass over there? - He didn't do anything... - I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to my son. Jamal, get your ass in the car. Can you get your ass over there? Go! Now! He wasn't doing anything. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to my son. Now, is there a problem? When are you gonna start listening? No, we don't have a problem, ma'am. You want to make a problem? You tell me. You're talking to my son. Everything all right? Everything's good, besides these dudes not doing they jobs. If you need anything, just holler. - I know. Appreciate you. - All right? Punk-ass cop. - I'm asking you. - I'll tell you the problem. Why your little man ain't in school? Eat me, Mouse, okay? And take your ass back to work. Ghetto ass. Go lift them boxes. What's good, bro? - Yo, what's up? - This cop here is harassing Jamal. I wasn't harassing anybody. You got a problem, Officer? Everything's just fine. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm totally sure. Missy? It's me. Licia. - You know her? - No, no. You got me confused. Alicia West. I said you're mistaken. Now, we good? Can we go? Officer? Yeah, you good. Uncle Tom-ass bitch. What you say? Yeah, all right. Keep an eye on that bitch. A'ight. Everything all right? Yeah. Listen. They were Kingston Crew. Watch it with those guys. Come on. Mouse? To some. It's Alicia. I was a friend of your cousin Missy. I know who you is. It's been a long time. What's up with Missy? That was cold. I don't know. You gotta talk to her about that. She-she got her own shit going on. She got a son now? For 10 years. Yeah. Jamal. He's a good kid. - He didn't mean no disrespect. - I was just talking to him. - That's all. - Let's roll, partner. Thank you. How much do we owe? Don't worry about it. Oh, no, that's all right. Cops don't pay. You're good. What, did he say something to you? Can we just go? You know him? Guess not. Not anymore. Copy that. Oh, Jesus. You're still here? Give her the chair, man. Let a real cop do work for a change. - It's your mom's site, Jennings. - Oh! You want to kill her traffic? I'm happy the broad's back in business. Twenty-three 45. Where's the fire? Oh. It is date night. Tina's mom's gonna watch the kids. Got us a room at the Brixton. I don't want to miss one second. Yo, Jennings. - Yeah? - Need someone to pull a double. Your name came up. Come on, Sarge. It's date night. Do me a solid. Can you find somebody else? I got four guys out. You're not the only badge with a family, Jennings. Come on. I'll take his spot. You're riding with Deacon Brown. Meet him in the lobby. Okay. Hey. Thank you. I owe you one. It's fine. I ain't got no plans. - Well, I do. - Know how long - I've been on the force? - They know nothing. You ask me questions, I answer them, and you still don't know. It doesn't make sense. I'm the oldest. Deacon Brown? - Oh, Deacon! - Deacon. Who are you? I'm riding with you. Where's Jennings? He got family commitments. I'm Alicia West. Nice to meet you. Look at this rook, man. Whew! Those guys narcs? Yeah. You're new. Bye, Deacon. Ha, ha. Actually, this is my third week. Oh, a whole three weeks. You pull a night shift yet? - No, sir, not here. - Not here? - Where were you before? - Kandahar. Oh, a vet. How long you been out? - Little over a year. - Hmm. My brother was killed in the first Iraq. What a waste. You really got to wear that thing? Why? You got something to hide? You better get used to 'em. We're all gonna be wearing 'em soon. Just don't point it at me. Any available unit, there's a 10-40 at Bar 1631. Suspect possibly armed. Dispatch, this is car 421. We're on it. One twenty-nine. Go ahead. - Put your hands down! - What you say? Why you put your hands in my face? - Boy... - Don't put your hands in my face! Don't touch me. Hey, yo! Yo! Back up! Back up! I told you to move. I need you to back up! Back up! Hey! Hey, back up! Hey! Sir! Sir! I need you to calm down, all right? Tell me what's going on here. - I'm calm. - What's going on? Take it easy, okay? Calm down. - I'm calm. - All right? I'm calm, Miss Officer. Tell me what's going on, sir. Wait, look. Why are you throwing punches, sir? I ain't throwing no punches. I swear, no punches. I'm trying to have a good time with my girl. You're out with your girl, you don't need to be throwing punches. I ain't throwing punches. I swear. I ain't throwing punches. I swear. Look, Miss Officer... Ow! What you doing? Huh? You out trying to get some tonight? What you doing? You want to be like that? Want to be like that? Get it down! Get that head down! What you doing, man? Stay on the hood! You ain't shit! - Hands on the car! - You know who I am? Put your head down! - What you got? - Brown. - Huh? What you got? - That is not necessary. Where your homeys at? - What'd I tell you? - Pussy cop! I said stay down! Hey, man, I'm gonna pop you right here. That's enough! Brown! That is enough! Stop it, man! Stop it! Let me tell you to stay still again. Stop it! Stop! That is not necessary! That is enough! Stop it! That had your name on it. Get your hands down. Huh? You're out here trying to catch a bullet tonight, huh? - You're trying to get some. - What you doing? Let me go! Kingston Crew! Look, about what happened out there... I'm sorry I... Sorry? Sorry will get your ass killed out here. Let me ask you a question. You think you're black? You think they're your people? Well, they're not. We are. You're blue now. Don't you ever forget that. You understand me? Yeah. You better. This is Brown. Uh-huh. Now? Yeah. We got to roll. Everything all right? We got a call. Let's go. What, on your phone? I still don't understand what we're doing here. I got to meet a C.I. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going? Stay in the car and close the door. - Why? - Because I said so. Just stay in the car. I'll be right back. Are you kidding? With me right here? Hey! You ain't got to worry about nothing. Just let me do this. Look, let me handle this. Let me run point on this. We can't make any sudden moves right now. It's hot out there. The DA's not gonna find out anything. We managed to make all the deliveries. and keep the payment schedule. Right. According to you. I've been loyal to you. It's been coming down for months. I have not said one thing. M-Malone, listen to me. - I'm listening. - This train's moving too fast for you to put the brakes on it. Nobody needs to know what you've done here. You have nothing to worry about. There's no way I would tell Darius. You got rid of everybody that can talk. That's right, Zero. I got rid of everybody that can talk. What the hell are you doing? I told you to stay in the car. What are you doing here? This isn't what it looks like. Just relax. Where you going? Put the gun down. These are bad guys. This is not what it seems. Just relax. What the hell did you do? She had a body cam on! So you shoot her? - You shoot her? - She was gonna run! - What did you want? - What'd I want... - I didn't use my service weapon! - Go, go! Go get it. Go get the body cam. Idiot! - Who is she? - West. - Who's West? - She's a rookie. You bring a rookie here? Are you out of your mind? - What are we gonna do now? - Nothing changes. - Nothing. You understand? - We shot a cop! Shut your mouth! Nothing changes. We plant the guns. You and the rookie rolled up on the Triple-Nines. They capped her. You got away. Simple. - What about her body cam? - What about the body cam? Triple-Nines took the body cam for evidence. It's simple. Stay with me. You understand? I don't know about this. You don't know? Look at me, son. You keep it simple. It tracks. We're good. Go help him find your partner. Go. Go. Go! We got a problem, Malone! You see her? Hey! Smitty! Yo, we've got a ghost! - What? - She's gone! She's unarmed! Her gun is here! Find her! Come on. Damn it. West! Just come on out! Just make it easy for us, all right? We just want the body cam, all right? That's it. I mean, what are you? You some kind of stuntwoman or something? Why don't you come out now? They weren't supposed to shoot you. All we want is the body cam. Now come on out, rookie. Why don't you come on out and let us get you taken care of. Okay? I'm sure that hurt. Dispatch. Dispatch. Shots fired. Officer needs backup. This is a code 108. - Your location? - Uh... Dispatch, this is Detective Terry Malone. - Is that you, Charlene? - Sure is. Oh, we got a rookie who just witnessed a gang-related 187, and she freaked out a little bit. I'm gonna take care of this. Let me take this one. Sounds good, Terry. I got plenty other calls to take. Okay, darling. Thank you. Dispatch? Dispatch. Damn it, Charlene. This is... This is a 108. Hey, West. She's gone, you hear me? Huh? West? Seems to me you got a hard choice to make right now. Are you one of us, or are you one of them? Bring me that body cam. Malone! Malone, alley! Stop! Help! Help! Hello! I know you're in there. - I need help. - Bitch, get off my porch. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am. Please. - Oh, hell no. What...? - Ma'am, please. Ma'am, can I use your phone? Please. - Can I use your phone? - What's the problem? - I've been shot. - Got a warrant? - Sir, can I use...? - What's the problem? Please. There are people chasing me! Please! Gonna bring that to my door? You don't understand! - I'm being chased! Please! - I don't care! You take that somewhere else. - Go. Can't help you. - Please! There are... Please! I need... West! Get your ass over here! She went there! Come on, she's down there! - You see her? - No, I mean, she was... - She was here. - I know she... - Where is she now? - I don't know! - You see her? - I lost her. - What do you mean? - I lost her! You kidding me? Are you guys kidding me? I chased her for blocks. I don't know where she went! I don't believe... You guys are amazing. - He had eyes on her! - Shut up! You brought her. You shot her. I got to clean this shit up! This is great. Go to a private channel. Go to 19. Dispatch has heard enough of this shit already. Spread the word. She cannot get to the precinct with that camera. Do you hear me? - I understand. Yes. - Shake your head! Okay. Tell everybody. Widen the search. Go. Go. - Go. Shut up. - Do your goddamn job, man. You brought the rook. What are you doing? Get in the car. You're like a kid. I know she's here. I know it. Just circle the block one more time. Any sign of her? No, nothing here. She couldn't have gotten far. Let's circle back. Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Easy. Easy. What's your name? Identify yourself, please. I'm Officer West. I need a ride. Let me get you some help. This is Sergeant... No, don't! Stay off the radio, please. Relax. It's fine. It's fine, all right? Are you okay? You look like hell. Where's your ride at? It's... It's a long story. All right, come on. Let's go. Let's get you out of here. Are you injured? Come on, we got you. Everything's gonna be fine. Come on. This is Brody. We found West. We got her. She's at Second and Danneel. It's all right. We got you. Everything's gonna be fine, all right? West. Hey. Don't be stupid, West. All he wants is the body cam. Damn it! We're closed. We open at 8. Hello? Hello. I'm telling you right now, if I got to come back there... I'm gonna beat your ass. I keep telling them about this door, man. Mouse, it's me. It's me. It's me. What the hell is going on? - Is that blood? - I need sugar. Look, I don't know what's going on, but you can't be in here. You need to get out of my store. - I've been shot. - What? What do you mean? Can I use your phone? Who shot you? Can I use your phone? You got to go. I don't want no part to this. You need to go back outside with all this bullshit, okay? Police is riding around here all the time. They'll help you. It was the cops that shot me. The cops? Please. I just need to call my partner and stop the bleeding, and I will go. I swear. Please. - What happened? - She got away. We hit the block a couple of times. - She's gone. - Available units, we have a possible 211 in progress at a market. Corner of St. Claude and Andry. That's not far. And we can't have anyone else sniffing around down here. Now, you guys go now. You understand? 1692 en route to possible 211. Copy, 1692. Hello. Kev, it's me. Jesus, West. - I need you, man. - Date night, remember? Tina's in the shower now. She's soaping up. I'm being serious, Kev. Yeah, no shit. So am I. Told you she's been doing yoga, right? I saw narc officers murder some kids this morning. I got the whole thing on body cam. Hold on a second. You're saying you... You filmed a police shooting? No, Kev, I filmed an execution. Jesus. - Where's Brown? - He's with them. Man, a load of others too. They... They're trying to kill me, man. Please. I need you. I got to get out of here. Yeah, okay. All right, um... Where's here? West? Where are you right now? I'll meet you at 12th and Felicity Street. Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right. Just hang tight. All right? I'm there in 30. Shit. Thanks. I'm sorry. How'd they find me? They didn't. It was me. Please. Please. You got to hide me. - You got to hide me. Please. - Look, I don't... I can't do this. Please. Open the door. One second. It's me. I-I called y'all. It's me. One second. - Open the door. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm the one who called y'all. - Appreciate y'all coming. - Back up. - What? - What took you so long? - You alone? - I'm the one who called y'all. Police! If there's anybody in the store, identify yourself. Sir, it was me that called y'all, all right? Turn around. Turn around. Hands on the counter. Come on. Spread your legs. Spread your legs. I'm the one who called y'all, sir. Mm-hm. Any sharp objects, needles, - knives I need to know about? - No, sir. What's up with all the aggression, man? What did you just say to me? Keep your mouth shut. Nothing. That's what I thought. Running your mouth. I could blow your head off right now. No one would even care. Anything going on back there? Nah. We're clear. Check his ID. I am so tired of coming into this neighborhood. You need to learn to keep your mouth shut and listen when an officer's talking. You understand me, boy? What do you got? Anything? - Nothing. Nothing. - Really? - He's clean. - All right. I guess that makes you free. Now... What was it you wanted to tell me so badly? That no one's here. I thought I heard a noise in the back. I got spooked. Just wanted a little backup. You know, wasting police time is a criminal offense, but I'm gonna let you slide. This time. I'll be watching you. You think she was here? Call Malone. Let's clear the store. Sorry. I didn't do it for you. I won't stay long, all right? I just need to close this wound, okay? You need to go to the hospital. You got a needle and thread? I... I don't know. How about glue? You got some glue? You're gonna glue it? You got a better idea? She gonna glue it. It's all I have. Thanks. Where'd you learn how to do that? Afghanistan. - The Army? - Mm-hm. Ah... So that's where you went. Did you really get footage on your body cam of them cops killing them boys? Yeah. So, what you gonna do? I'm gonna get it into evidence and expose them. Wow. God. Damn. That worked. How are you gonna get to your partner? I'm gonna walk. Unless you got a ride I can use. I don't have a ride. I walk here, a couple blocks. Dauphine Arms. Then I'm stuck with plan A. I got something for you. You need to stay on the low. Put this on. Less conspicuous. Thank you. Why are you doing this? Why don't you just give it to them? Come on. You're police. They're police. Murder's murder. Don't matter who you are. Jesus. You all right? Just drive. Just drive. Jesus, we got to get you to a hospital. No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I need to upload this footage first. The Fifth? No. Somewhere else. Talk to me. What the hell happened? I was rolling with Brown. He got a call on his cell, and next thing I know, we're at some abandoned power plant, and there are narcs killing what I can only assume were drug dealers. They tried to kill me, Kevin. Holy shit. All right. So, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna upload the footage, and once it's in the system, I'll call I.A. I.A.? No, no, no. Or the Feds. Whoever deals with this. Slow down. Think about that. That's gonna make you a rat. So? Just think about it for a second. You want to can Malone's ass? Fine. I mean, get him and Smitty off the street. Yes, but have the captain do it. All right? Nice and quiet. You bring in I.A., and, I mean, your career's over. There's not a blue in the city that's gonna have your back. How do you know it was Malone and Smitty? What? You just named them. How do you know? I don't know. I mean, you must have said. No. No, Kev. - I said "narcs." - Jesus. Come on. Partner, look at me, all right? It's me. All right, take it easy. All right? Look at me. Take a breath. It's me. All right? - Pull over. - W-we're almost there. - Pull over! - Jesus Christ. Are you armed? I was. Put it in park. - Empty your pockets. - Come on... Empty your pockets. Come on. You are making a monumental mistake. No, I don't think so. Where were you taking me, huh? To Malone? - I'm taking you to the Fourth. - Oh, bullshit! Why did Malone murder those kids? I'm not saying shit. - Yes, you are. - No. I'm asking you why. I'm telling you I am not saying shit. Goddamn it! I am not playing with you. - All right? I will shoot you! - All right! He didn't murder them. Okay? He silenced them. - What are you talking about? - They're his sellers. Look, every drug bust, Malone splits the take. Half goes into evidence, half back on the street. That's how it works. - Why kill them? - Have you seen the news? The chief, the mayor, they're cracking down right now. Six cops just got busted last month. Malone's cleaning up the shit before the spyglass turns on him. Jesus. Hey, come on. Those guys... they're no great loss. You don't get to make that call. Why is he stopped? What's he doing? Holy... You lying piece of shit. No. No. No, West. West, run, and I can't help you! Mouse. What the hell are you doing here? How the hell do you know where I live? Dauphine Arms. You told me. I have got nowhere else to go. They gonna kill me if I stay out there. Uncle Milo. - You all right? - Jamal. Go back inside. I'm good. Why would you bring this here? Why don't you take this shit to your door? Hey. I know you. You're that cop from the store. Jamal, - where is your mom? - She's working. She's working. Go back in, man. What happened to your partner? He's not gonna help. Didn't want to cross his boys in blue? - He's a coward. - You just gullible and blind. You know what? I am sick of this "them versus us" bullshit! I don't have to choose. All right? I'm a person. You're a person. Those kids I saw murdered this morning were people. Nice speech. I'll make sure I put it on your headstone. So, what exactly are you saying? Because Zero and his guys weren't cops, I shouldn't care? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just say Zero? - Yeah. - Y'all shot Zero? You know him? This shit just went up a level. Mouse, I just need to stay here till dark, and then I'll go, I promise you. All right? Please. - Cap. - Malone. - What the hell happened here? - We got a big problem. Turf war, Triple-Nines and the Kingston Crew. Brown rolled up with the rookie. She got trigger-happy. She shot a kid. Now she is in the wind. You're telling me West killed a kid and now she's a ghost? Yeah. Problem is, it wasn't just a kid. It's Darius Tureau's nephew. That's a problem. Why didn't you call it in? - It wasn't that... - I told him not to. My guys got to find her, captain. I don't know if you've seen the news, but our department is under the microscope. I.A. is looking for any excuse. Cap, I'm all over it, okay? We're looking for her on the QT. They find out she's out there alone, she's dead. She won't live the night. You got to let me handle this. You bring the jacket? - How'd you let this happen? - She panicked, captain. I want you at the station as soon as possible. I want details on everything that happened here. Real details from you. Not from him. Let me handle this. Sir. Sir. Let him through. Go ahead. Darius. Malone. Where he at? Let me see him. He wanted to go ahead and get it done as quickly as we can. I hear you. Now what are you doing? We need her dead. We're running out of time. Don't touch the body. I raised this boy like he was my own. He's like a son to me. A hell of a job you did. Put a muzzle on your dog, Malone. - All right. - Before I put him down. All right. Can I at least close his eyes? No, you can't touch him. The guys at the lab got to do their job. Tell them not to waste their time. We all know who did this. Don't we, Malone? Who? Triple-Nines. Officially. Unofficially, it was a cop. A cop? Why are you telling me this? Because this rookie is a liability... and we don't need to go to war over her. It's a bitch? Yeah. I want all of her info, Malone. You hear me? Hey, yo, D. You gonna believe what Malone said? White boy never lied to us yet. I want that bitch dead. Now. - It's done. - Put everybody on it. Yo, let me ask you a question. Now, how could you not get the camera? - I tried. - Shut up. Who is she? Let me see. Alicia West from the Ninth Ward. In and out of juvie. Joined the Army when she was 17. Two tours in Afghanistan. Jesus Christ. You know that? - You know that? - She said she was in the Army. Graduated the academy with honors. No family, no kin, no emergency contact. Woman is a ghost. She gets that camera back to the station, and each and every one of us is going to prison. Understand? This is your fault. Why'd you bring her here? I should drop you now, you stupid son of a bitch. You kidding me? You. Did you let her go? - Did you let her go? - No. - You didn't let her go? - No. What else you know not in those papers? - I-I don't know. - What else? Friends. She got a guy she's banging? She got somebody? - Say something! - All right. I don't know, man! Look, I would tell you, all right? You know I would tell you. The only person that I've ever seen that she even maybe knows is this-this guy at this market. That market, is it... St. Claude and Andry? Yeah. How'd you know that? There's nothing out there. When's the last time you slept? I don't remember. You should probably get some rest. It's gonna be dark soon. You got to leave out. Can I ask you something? Why did I become a cop? Yeah. I was gone a long time. Lived in a lot of different places, and... after a while, I stopped seeing enemies or allies. I just saw people. Not good, not bad. Just... folks trying to figure life out like I was. And then, after my mom passed, and I was here, home... I just wanted to help. Food banks and inner-city programs help. These cops out here... not so much. We're just animals to them. Shit's got to change. Get some sleep. Got the video footage set up right here. Everything's queued up. All right, play it. - Who is that? - It's Milo Jackson. Mouse. He works here in the mornings. Go ahead, fast-forward. Stop. Mouse? I want his address. Yeah. We good? Triple-Nines say the streets are ours till dawn. A cop. Yeah, well, it was still Zero. You dig? Let's go. D. I want to help. Zero was family to me too. The way you can help me is by staying alive. Look here. I can't lose you both. You hear me? Drop it! - Drop it! - Jamal! - What the hell are you doing? - She killed Zero. - What?! - I didn't kill anyone. She's lying. Everybody knows. Give me that, man. What are you doing, brah? She killed Zero. Look. Where'd you get that from? Darius. Darius Tureau. You got a price on your head. This photo's probably all over the city. - Malone. - Who did you call? I'm asking, did you tell anybody she was here? What address? What's the address? It's Dauphine Arms. Should be two streets up. Let's find this bitch. Hey, remember what I told you? Uh-huh. Strap up. Let's go. Let's go. Let's do this. Come on. Let's go. This gun ain't even loaded. We got to move. He's here. Go to the apartment now and lock the door. Now! What do you mean, we got to go? Malone is here, all right? He hasn't traced me. He's connected you. So you're either with me, or you can stay and get a bullet in your head. You choose. It's empty. You know, maybe she didn't come here. We need to get out the hood. Is there anyone you trust with a car? That's that bitch there. Come on! Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it! Alicia! Mouse? Mouse? Mouse! Mouse? - You all right? - Yeah. There's a church back there. There's a pastor in there that I know. He's good people. He's got a ride. Just go, and I'mma meet you there. - You're hurt. I ain't leaving. - Alicia, listen. We got to get out of the Ninth. That car won't run, and my leg is messed up, okay? I'm not gonna make it over this gate. I don't want to slow you down. I need you to trust me. It's my hood. Just go over the gate, and I'mma meet you there. I know what's moving out here. Trust me. Go! Go now! Get in! Get in the truck. Get in the truck! I'm telling you, she didn't do nothing. Where is she? I told you. Where's the cop? I don't know. Nigga, if you don't start talking soon, Ox here is gonna start taking pieces off your ass. You like your ear, Picasso? Van Gogh. What'd you say? Van Gogh chopped off his ear. You dumb-ass. I like this nigga. He's smart. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second, D. Let me have a word with this fool. Come on, Mouse. Why are you protecting her? She don't care about your black ass. Looks like you got her all wrong. Oh, so she got your head all turned around? She ain't one of us. She picked her side. Mouse, you don't owe her nothing. You're wrong about her. - But she killed Zero. - No, she didn't. Missy, enough. That's all you got, pussy? Round two, bitch. This is Alicia West. I'm a police officer, and... this body cam contains footage of narc officers murdering civilians. If you find it, please turn it in to the FBI. Thank you. Girl, you've been gone a long time. We don't even respond to calls from in there anymore. Not unless there's a blue in trouble. Not unless there's a blue in trouble. Not unless there's a blue in trouble. Not unless there's a blue in trouble. Yo, who that? We're gonna be there anyway. I don't know. So, you know... Yo, that's that bitch that killed Zero, man. - Yo, it's her. - Yeah, that's her! Somebody get that bitch! Somebody make the call. Oh, hell no. Somebody bury that bitch! Get your ass out of here! Somebody's gonna die today! Yo. Somebody take down that bitch right there! I got your ass. Kingston Crew all day, bitch! Hey, yo, D. You're not gonna believe this. This dumb bitch is here. - Dead girl walking. - Bitch, what you doing? Huh? Huh? I didn't do it. I didn't... I didn't kill your nephew! It was Malone! It was Malone! - It was Malone! - Shut your lying mouth. My body cam. I filmed the whole thing on my body cam. Okay, that's why Malone wants me dead. He's using you, all right? - Body cam? - Oh, this is bullshit. She don't have a camera. Malone killed my nephew? - Yes, yes, he did! - Yo, this... This bitch is lying, homey. Why am I here if I'm lying? Where's the body cam? - I stashed it. - Where? Show me Mouse, and I promise you I'll give you the body cam. I promise you. I showed you mine. Now show me yours. What's going on? Something big's going down at Kingston Manor. - Yeah. - Hey, Malone, it's Brown. Listen, man, King's got West. That's good news, isn't it? I don't think you understand. The captain's sending in the cavalry to get her. Shit. Dead or alive, if they get their hands on that body cam, Malone, we gonna have problems. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you. I hear you. She's got to get back to the precinct to download the information from that camera. We just got to get the camera. And you know what this means, Malone? We cannot let Darius get this information. - Do you understand me? - I understand. We'll be fucking dead. Son of a bitch. We got to go. Now! What you waiting for? Let's go. I wondered if I'd see your face. Look what they did to me, Missy. You saw what they did to Mouse. And you're still here? That's your fault, not mine. Right. 'Cause this is where I wanted to be right now. What, you think you better than me? No, I don't think I'm better than you, but you have a son, Missy. What you even doing here? Mm-mm. Don't act like you know me. You haven't lived my life. You don't know the shit I've been through since you left. - Then tell me. - Why? Why, Alicia? Because you care? - Of course I do. - You bailed! I begged you to come with me. We were 17, and I was terrified out there without you. Yeah? Well, you should've stayed gone. Why? 'Cause seeing me reminds you you had a choice? Bitch, I'll whup your... Seeing you reminds me that you killed Zero. I didn't kill Zero, and you know it. We gonna find out, bitch. Hey, D. Right where she said it was. How this shit even work? I don't know. Yo, Tez. Quit the game and figure this shit out. I don't know. I-I may have to hack into it. Did I ask for a damn TED Talk? Just figure the shit out. Make it play. Darius's lair is here. We got to bring West out alive. It's on the east side! Watch it! Watch it! So, what we doing, Malone? Get the body camera. She does not get out of here alive. Do you understand me? Let's move out! Listen, man. I will help you get the camera, but I am not gonna kill her. Well, then look the other way, Jennings. That's what you do, isn't it? You got something? You know these are police files, right? This is easy. You play video games all day. You can crack that. This way. Move, move, move. You know whatever's on that camera, it's not going to get us out of here, right? - Anything? - Not yet. Stairs. Take Brown with you. All these files are encrypted. There's nothin' on there? Okay, wait, I think I see something. Got anything? No. It's nothing. - I can't open this. - Time's up. I told you this bitch was lying. No, wait, it's there. - It's there. - Wait. D. Wait, this is it. - D, I-I got it. - ...the payment schedule. Right. According to you. Look, I've been loyal to you. It's been coming down for months. I have not said one thing. - M-Malone, listen to me. - I'm listening. This train's moving too fast for you to put the brakes on. Nobody needs to know what you've done here. Look, you have nothing to worry about. There's no way I would ever tell Darius. You got rid of everybody that can talk... That's right, Zero. I got rid of everybody that could talk. Hey, D, just because she filmed it don't mean - she wasn't part of it. - Yeah. What the hell are you doing? I told you to stay in the car. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just relax. This isn't what it looks like. We got to post this shit. Take him down. We're good. - Hey, yo, it's a hit! - Yo, what the fuck? Shoot 'em, man! That's him! Shoot that motherfucker! What the fuck? Missy, take Tez with you. - Tez, jump! - I'm shot! Go, Missy. - Where you at? Shit! - Move. D, D, move! - Shit, I'm shot! - That bitch in the back room! Cover me! Suppress! Suppress and shoot! - Move it forward! - Get them! Move it forward! Go, go, go! Open! - These cops. - Watch that door. This is fucked up! Open it! Go! Eyes on that hallway! Where'd Missy go? She went that way! Come on, you motherfuckers! Come on! Come on! Pussy-ass cops. I'll cover you. Go! Come on, Malone! Ox! Go! Go! Ox! No! I saw the body cam, asshole. I saw what you did to my nephew. You killed my nephew. You killed Zero. You played me. Where is it? Where's the body cam? Where's the body cam? Kiss... my ass. Where's West? Somebody must have taken her. Yo, Brown, w-wait a second. Okay, go. Go. There. I did my job. Everybody, calm down! West! Freeze! Put your hands on your head. Listen, I don't know what they told you, all right? - Get your hands up. - But, uh, - it's not true. - Stay where you are! Um, my body cam... I filmed the whole thing on my body cam. That's the guy! You're a fool, West. You should've just given... Unh! You okay? Shots came from next level! I'm never gonna get this cam out of here dressed like this. You ain't getting out of here. The entire police force is out there. We're not gonna make it out of here alive. They're looking for a female cop, right? If you give me your vest and your body cam, I can't promise, but I'll get this shit into the station. That ain't gonna work. Look at us. Alicia, you got to expose these bastards. We ain't go through all this shit for nothing. This morning, you wouldn't even talk to me. - Now you'll do this? - You got any better ideas? No, I don't. Give it to me. I got this. Thank you. One thing... I don't know nothing about no computers. You got to tell me what to do. You need to calm down! Let us go! Let us go! Let us go! Can you hear me? Just listen to me! You're okay. Jennings, over here! Yeah, I'm coming. I need you to get out of my way. Check every apartment on this floor. Let's go. Come on. - Too tight. - Come on. Relax. West! Okay. Okay. Give it up, West! If you want to get out of here alive, I'm your only hope. This district died after Katrina. FEMA screwed us. Politicians screwed us. It was on life support. Over half the businesses, the people, the families, they all left! West... they all left, just like you. Rats... on a sinking ship. Not me. Uh-uh, not mine. We stayed. We fought for this city. Even when there was no money for schools or... streetlights... people still want the law. Well, that costs. It costs. Everyone's over at Kingston Manor. I just saw Malone's ride outside. You seen him or Smitty anywhere? No, man, I haven't. Have a good shift, all right? Hey, you, too, buddy. Do you expect all these men, good men, to put their lives on the line day in and day out for nothing? While those scumbag drug dealers make all that money... Is that what you expect? West! Come here. You son of a... Oh! Get him! - Go ahead, girl! - She's fucking him up! She's kicking his ass! Shit. Get your bitch ass back! Son of a... Go ahead. Put a hot one in him. All right there, shorty. Your bitch ass. Y'all get back. Back up, back up. Get out the way! You're under arrest, Malone. You have the right to remain silent. - I know my rights! - Oh, it's just other people's you have a problem with? Shoot that motherfucker. Take out your cuffs. Come on, y'all, back up. - Look! - Drop your gun! Do it now! We will shoot you! I'm a cop! You're a cop killer. Put the gun down and back away! You better put the gun down. He's tripping. Licia, put it down. - Do it. - Put your weapon down! I got this! Nobody move! Nobody move! Stay back, everyone. I got this. Stop. Stop. Don't move. What are you doing in here? I do know you. You're the guy from the market. Don't move. I swear to God. Up against the wall. Turn around. Go. Spread 'em. I'm gonna give you one more chance. Where's the camera? Where is it? I could blow your freaking brains out, and they'd give me a medal, you know? Breaking into a police station. What? What did you do? Uh-huh. How does it feel? Huh? Huh? Where is it? Where's the body cam? Where'd you put it? Last chance. I'll make this all go away. Huh? Look at 'em. Look at 'em. You picked the wrong side. Nobody cares about you. Look at 'em... You think they'd give a shit about if you live? Think they're gonna give up their lives for you? - Where's the camera? - That's not the point. - What is the point? - The point is: "Be the change," you asshole. You have nothing to worry about. There's no way I would tell Darius. You got rid of everybody that can talk. Patch me through to SRT. You ain't changed shit. This is Captain Hackett. Stand down. That's a direct order. Do you hear me? Alicia West is innocent. - Stand down now. - Gun! Damn! Oh, my God! Son of a... Crazy! Stay down, Malone. Don't move. Hell, man... Drop your gun! Get your hands on your head! - It's over, man. - Yo, yo, yo. You have any idea... ...how many nightmares y'all gave me? Huh? But you know what? I'm gonna let you slide. This time. Nah. - I'm hit. I'm hit. Easy. - Okay. I need everybody to back up! Get your goddamn hands off me. - What are you doing? - You're under arrest, - you piece of shit. - Under arrest for what? What are the charges? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? Think you made a difference here tonight, West? You changed nothing. Maybe not, but it's a start. Take his ass to jail. Come on. Good job, West. Way to go, West. Step back! Sir, I said move! Ma'am, to your left. I'm sorry. Thank you. Good morning, New Orleans. In the news, after a police investigation, Detective Terry Malone was charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the execution of three unarmed black men. Today's guests will discuss the tragedy and the surprise injustices. I'm happy you're here. You know... you saved my life. No, no. You saved my life. I appreciate you.
