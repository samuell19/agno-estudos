It's my favorite. Are you scared? Chicken Nam, do you want to see a ghost? You mean, face-to-face? Like, a real ghost? Of course I do! Have you seen one before? I don't mean a phony Ouija Board I want to see a real ghost I've seen them all the time When I was very young, they almost killed me My mother took me to the temple and the monk gave me this amulet So you've seen ghosts?

I've been here for a while So why aren't you in class? Well... I want to go in with you - Really? - Yes Let's go Traditional ceremonies are different in each region depending on their history and environment In the North we see, for instance, the Lantern Festival In this picture you can see the offering rite to the spirits of the ancestors During the holidays I'd like you to find more cases for your reports and presentations That's it for now, thank you See you next time We've fooled Thongsook! Sure, I bet he has no idea where we are now Why do we have to hide this from him? Please, Nam let's keep him out of this just for once Wherever we go, that dumbass sticks to us like a leech He doesn't want to stick to us, just her I feel sorry for him, nobody wants to hang out with him And don't you feel sorry for us, huh? All right? Let's meet at the pier From there it's 2 hours to the island Right See you at 10 at the pier - Okay. Sure - Hey, let me see the map Easy! Jack! Can't you see the table is wet? It's all right, I have another map - Let's go - I'm not treating you! Easy man! - I'm hungry - Let's go to Jae Ju - What? - Jae Ju? Are you really going to spend the night on the island? Yes, just one night Nobody wants to spend the night there anymore Why's that? It looks like such a nice place My uncle told me that once there were a lot of people on the island But they all moved out after that night of Devouring Spirit ceremony Something went wrong and a lot of people were killed It was an offering rite to the guardian spirit at the shrine on the night of the 13th My uncle was there, it scared the shit out of him My soul is melancholy... my spirit roams freely Bring me chicken and cattle bring me the whole flock of ducks Bring me goats, deer and donkeys, bring me the blood of the beasts! - Yes! - Hooray!

You're here, so let's go take a dip I'll go and explore the island Anybody want to come with me? Boy, every island is the same! There're just rocks and trees everywhere! You're wrong - this island is different - How so? The guy who mortgaged the land told my dad... that this place is crawling with ghosts! The ghost did it! You're so chicken! - Well, the ghosts here are particularly vicious - Really? The boatman hasn't finished his story, so here it is That night, the ritual went horribly wrong because an altar boy freaked out and dropped a candle The spirit there is fierce I don't believe that - I'll take you to see them - No! I'm scared! Pui! Pui! What? Do you have painkillers? In the bag near the door Thanks Take only one tablet It's strong, or you'll sleep for two days I already took two Well, good night then! We'll take you into the horror mode right now We'll take a trip to... the shrine at the other end of the island That's where villagers used to make offerings It's like paying a protection fee to the ghosts! A protection fee for the ghosts! Are you scared? I... I... I'd better go back to be with Nam Come here! - Don't be a spoilsport! - Come here!
