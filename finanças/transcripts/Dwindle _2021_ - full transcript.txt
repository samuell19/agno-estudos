Keep the cigar, what are you doing? What is your problem… drive. Look at her over there. -What kind of question are you asking? -God save me -Kidnappers -Didn't you see the plate number? I told you this thing wouldn't work, you have chased the customer away. Look, Chinedu this Taxifly thing won't work. It won't work… I don't like these kind of things.

This lunatic was mimicking big brother's voice. This is the first money we will make. Didn't I tell you? Do you think if it was taxifly we would have had customers like this? We have to bill him more. Don't worry about that don't you trust me? If I take you to Makoko, you'll find lot more customers. God works in mysterious ways. -I want to smoke. -For what reason? Do you know if the customer will be comfortable? Did the customer complain? Please, please, please… -Guy, use your head… -What kind of person is this? What does that mean? Did the customer complain?
