- Is anyone there? Help! - Veronica, what are you doing? Everyone's at the table waiting for us. - One second. - What took you guys so long? - Can't go anywhere without her telling the whole world on Friend's List. - Whatever. - Seriously, Veronica, your Friend's List looks like an advertisement for every business in town. Where are you going? You just got here! - This hot guy from Friend's List is here. I'm gonna go meet up with him and get him to buy us all drinks. - Such a skank. - Probably some bald 40-year-old. - Whatever, jealous? - What do you want from me? - I want to be your friend. - Good morning, honey. I asked for a 10 o'clock wake up, though. - Oh, really? Ow. Eh, she wasn't my type anyway. That's good enough. - Yeah. Yeah, this Veronica-- Yeah, but the problem is I can't read Veronica's last name, here. Who filed this report? First of all, it's got to get to me a couple of hours earlier. Yeah, I'll get someone over there as soon as possible. This has gotta improve, okay? Okay, bye. Glad you still remember how to knock. - Captain, did you know the coffee pot's empty out there? - Yeah, we might, we've got an assault here, okay? And possible rape. Young woman early 20's, over in Summerside. And you're gonna need to get over there. - Did you know your coffee pot's empty out there, captain? You're also out of ice. FYI. - You know, you're gonna have to wake up on this one. I mean, your past accomplishments are only gonna carry you so far. I mean, wearing a gun is good, getting up in the morning is good, returning phone calls, that's even better, putting on a badge, hey. Eventually, you're gonna need to get some new accomplishments, some fresh ones, like this case. - Yep. - You gotta do some police work somewhere. - You don't have to worry about me. Very rude when people don't knock when they come in your office. - I'm running out of excuses to keep you on active duty. - Yeah. - Yeah, no, I'm serious. I'm running out of excuses to keep you on active duty. - You don't gotta worry about me. You don't have to worry about me, Captain. - Oh, I know. - I'm on the job. - That's why I'm reassigning you with a new partner. - You gotta be kidding me. - No one else wants to work with you. - Why not? I'm fun. - If you had a stention you'd look like Ted Bundy. - Besides that. - Detective Burkeee, meet Detective Chance. - Hi. - Nice ass. - That's the weirdo that was half naked sleeping in his truck over about half a block over. - Could've carpooled you know! Save on gas. - Morning Detective. - Morning Mike. - Wait a minute, he's a cop? - This lady claims she saw somebody that looked like you this morning, said she found him naked in his car. - Oh yeah? She wake him up early for his 10 A.M. wake up call? - Oh for-- - What? - Nothing, come here. So, who was first on the scene? - That'd be me. - Where's the body? - Sent her to the hospital, she's pretty banged up. - She's still alive? - Barely, she suffered. - Don't you want to question your responding officer a little more? - He's right there, you know Mike. Knock yourself out. - Besides the older lady, did anybody else see anything? - Well, we've been knocking on doors, but it's basically the same story. Car was gone when they went to sleep, woke up with cops in the front yard. - Thanks. - Okay. - That's it? - Yeah. Good job, well done. - Hi, how are you? - Fine thanks. Looking for a chemical burn victim that was admitted today. - One moment. - How do you know it's a chemical burn? - Room 113. - Thank you. - Excuse me, sir, you can't be in here. - Doc, how bad are her burns? - Pretty serious, but she'll live. - Are they chemical burns? - Yes, most likely hydrofluoric acid. - Where does somebody get something like that? It's not like you can find it at Walmart. - If I had to guess-- - Stupid internet, right? Whole world's on the internet these days. - That would be my guess. - Is there sexual assault here, doc? - No, test came back negative for anything like that. - When can I talk to her? - At this point, I can't say for sure. - Okay, well here's my card. When she wakes up I want to be the first one to hear about it. - You got eye contact and dialogue, what's your secret? Hey, so, you gonna fill me in on what you're thinking? - I'm thinking you kind of annoy me a little bit. - You know, it'd be nice if we could work together on this. I might actually be able to contribute something and you could tell me what you want me to do. - Oh yeah, you want to help me? - Yeah. - Can you close the door. Thank you. - Nobody move. Now you made your friend, the record player, the CD player. Hello? Oh, we got empties. We got empties. How much of an asshole are you? About this much. I ain't going down for fucking nobody. Nobody. - Is anyone there? Help! - Good morning, honey. - You know you have like three plates in this house and they're all clean? We have 30 shot glasses and every single one of them are dirty, hmm. - Princess. When'd your momma drop you off? - About an hour ago. Her and Mark are going on a trip so I'm with you all week. - Oh, that's great, princess. So what'd you do in my house? - It's called cleaning. - I don't know what that means. What time is it? Oh shit, I'm gonna be late. - Well, you better not wait to get tested. You know, pregnancy scares can be the worst. - You got jokes, huh? I'm not even gonna touch that one. Okay, I'm gonna get going here. - Hey! - Cam? - Burke, my man, what is good? - Listen, I got something for ya. - We. - What you got? - Do me a favor, go to Friend's List and pull up a profile on a Veronica Connelly for us, please. - Oh, shit! Dude! That's hot. - So I'm thinking somebody high-jacked her profile after they did that to her face. Son of a bitch. - Yeah, and wrote a nice little love poem, too. - What do you mean? - Beauty is a vein and doubtful good. A shining gloss that fadeth suddenly. A flower that dies when it becomes a bud. A doubtful good, a gloss, a flower, lost, faded, broken. Dead within an hour. - What's that supposed to mean? - What's this mean? - It's a love sonnet from Shakespeare, do you guys ever read books? - This girl posted everything. Where she is, where she was going-- - Who she was going to meet. - Okay, um, yeah, I mean it's all right here. I mean, look at all these dots, that's from this week alone. I mean, this girl might as well have had a tracking chip up her ass. - I don't get this shit. Why would someone post everything for the whole world to see, you know? - It's been a while since you been under 30, Humper. - Yeah, but how could somebody know where anybody's gonna be before they check in? - Guys, do you know how easy it is to stalk people on Friend's List these days? - Oh yeah? We should just ask the last girl you dated, right Fuckball? - Whatever! Okay, look, I'll break it down for you guys. Alright, so let's just say that this dude has a routine, goes to the same sushi restaurant every Tuesday night at eight P.M., okay? He checks in on his Friend's List just to make sure that everybody knows how cool he is that he knows what a Playboy roll is. Not only that, but depending upon your privacy settings, even a perfect stranger can see what you're doing. So, if he's an idiot, which he most likely is, he'll post some sort of status update on what the rest of his plans are for the night. I mean, dude, it's so easy. Any sicko with basic computer knowledge can stalk whoever they want to on this thing. - Fuck me? I don't think there's gonna be much fucking at all in your future. - So I'm just gonna say, chances are pretty good that you're gonna find this guy on her Friend List. - So can you-- - Find him? - Who are you talking to? Come on, who are you talking to? - No, let me know! - Hey, whoa! I think I got a suspect right here. Alright, so look. Right after she checked into the club this guy posted a comment immediately. They start flirting a little bit, he asks her out back to smoke and then it all stops dead. - Well, what's his real name? - This guy got a name other than Jeremy T. Dog, or what? - Probably, man. I mean, I'll find out, but it might take a while. - That's alright, you got no life anyway, right? - Oh! No, I do not! - Captain, do me a favor. Reassign this dumb broad, will ya? - Excuse me? - You know, that's really getting old. - It's not working out. We can't come to an agreement on the floral pattern for the breakfast nook, will you reassign her, please? - I decide who works on what cases, not the other way around. - Reassign me? - Shh. The adults are talking, alright? - Look, it's not like it's my first time! - It's quiet time now. - Look, I came in here wanting to give you the benefit of the doubt, now I know you've developed a bit of a reputation as this burned out asshole, but I decided to overlook that because I read up on some of those cases you worked on before you decided to crawl into a bottle and die! But if you're just gonna treat me like some 12-year-old that doesn't know which side of the bed to piss on, then you can go crawl back under that dysfunctional rock that you don't shower in! And I can handle this case on my own. - You done? - You're on this, so are you, get over it. You too. Sleep it off, start fresh in the morning! -Hit the bar! - I need you both on your best game for this! - Dad? Dad? Dad? - What, what, what is it? - I asked how your day was. - It was long, sweetheart, it was good. How about you, how was yours? Jamie? - Well-- - Who'd you hit? - How'd you know? I forget sometimes you're that great detective. It's just these kids wouldn't stop teasing me at lunch for not dressing like a slut. I mean, all the other girls wear so much make-up and skimpy clothes. - That's a good thing, good to be yourself. So who'd you hit first? - This kid named Connor, such an ass. - So am I gonna have to go to the principal's office for you? - No. He was too embarrassed about being hit by a girl that he didn't tell on me. - Come here, kid. You're my whole world, I love you. - I love you too, dad. - Hey kid. - Hmm? - No cell phones at the dinner table. - Who's Laura? - What? - She just sent me a friend request saying that she's your new partner. - Let me see that. What the hell is this? - Apparently you're not the only detective at the station. Here. Well I'm adding her. She looks really nice. - She's a pain in the ass. - Well, so are you, but I keep you around. - Watch it. - Okay, that was, I deserved that. - You like that one? - No. - Hey! - Hey, I've been trying to call you. - Yeah, I've been trying to sleep. - Well you may want to get up. I've got the address of that kid who commented on Veronica's check-in. On my way there now. - Okay, give it to me. - 178 Rockford Street. - How long you been here? - 30 minutes, just watching the place. - Is there any movement? - Nothing. - By the way, did you friend request my daughter on Friend's List? - Yeah. - Why? - Honestly? I felt sorry for her. - Did you call for backup? - Well, we don't really have any hard evidence, so no search warrant. But I figured we could give 'em a friendly chat. - I like the way you think. - Jeremy? - Jeremy, open up, police! - Hey, what if he's on the other side with a gun? - I'm gonna shoot him. - Let's walk around and see if we can't look in some windows, okay? - Alright, you go check that side I'll go this way, alright? - Little jumpy? - How'd you get in there? - Back door was open, go around front, I'll let you in. - What are you thinking entering the house on your own? - Relax, I don't think he's home. - You want that on your tombstone? - What was that? Jeremy? - Jeremy, can you hear me? Call it in, get an ambulance over here right now. - Well, he suffered a lot of blood loss, but whoever did this to him made sure he didn't die. - Hmm. - What do you mean? - After removing his penis, they cauterized the wound to keep blood loss down and they kept the right medicine pumped into him to make sure there was no infection. They knew what they were doing. - When do you think we can talk to him? - Possibly tomorrow. - Well, how's the girl doing now, doc? - I checked on her this morning, she's conscious in a stable condition. - Can I talk to her? - Absolutely. - Ms. Connelly? Veronica? Can you hear me? It's okay. I know, you're in the hospital now, hun. You're safe, okay? In the hospital, okay? Veronica, this is my partner. My name's Detective Burke. I'm gonna ask you a couple questions, okay? Would that be okay? Do you recognize this guy? You do? Ms. Connelly, did he do this to you? It's okay. Did you get a good look at him? Whoever did this to you? Yeah, could you describe it for me? - I'll get a doctor. - Wait. - She needs a doctor, we need a doctor in here! - Hold on a second, I said wait, just hold on. I know how tough this is, honey, but, can you just describe him for me? - He-he wore a mask. He said I was beautiful. He wanted to be my friend. And then he, - Doctor! We need a doctor in here! Why do you think she was struggling with talking? - Inhalation from the vapor of the acid, apparently. - Yeah, how did you know it was an acid burn that day at the scene? - Well, you got to look for what's not there, kid. - Smart ass. - Can I get you something to drink? - I'm waiting for someone. Yeah, give me some coffee. - Alright. - If she ain't here in five minutes. At least there's an option. 8:30. Bitch. Bet her boyfriend left her. Dumb bitch. Your loss. Stupid whore, she deserves to be single. - Am I in the right house? What the hell are you doing here? - I invited her. - You didn't ask me about this. - You would've said no. - Damn right I would've said no. - Whatever, tough guy act doesn't work with me. - What? She invited me. I didn't want to be rude. But I guess I've overstayed my welcome. I don't want to intrude on dinner. - Are you kidding me? No, Laura, you're staying. Yeah, save your stink eye for somebody else, bud. Dad! - Yeah? - Sit. - Okay. You are so grounded, dude. - Yeah, yeah, I'm already serving like, what? Two life sentences? So what's one more? - Since you're already here, blondie, you can stay for dinner. Hey, you want to bring that chicken over? I'm kind of hungry though, so, can you hurry that up? - Well thank you. This good enough for you, partner? - Yeah, what'd you guys make, is that chicken? Just let me know if you find anything, alright? - What was that? - Nothing. Maybe something, but maybe nothing. - Are you ever gonna shed some light on how you're connecting the dots? - I'm headed to bed but, thanks for coming over, Laura. - Thanks for having me, girl. We'll do it again some time. - Awesome. I also make a killer lasagna. - Good night, baby. I love you to the moon and back. - I love you too, daddy. - Can I ask you something? - You still having trouble playing detective? - You know what, I'm not playing anything. I just want to know how you haven't managed to screw her up. - When you love someone so much, you just don't, you know? - Maybe you're not such an asshole after all. - Wouldn't count on it. Thanks for dinner. - Yeah, you're welcome. Don't get used to it, kid. - Don't worry, I won't. - Son of a bitch! What the hell? Hey, who tied me up here? God damn it! Somebody better get in here quickly. There you are you son of a bitch! Hey, what is this all about, huh? Hey, I'd pay good money to get tied up and have some broads come in and take care of me! I'll be coming back there and I'll tie you up! See how you like it! We're gonna watch a little porn, huh? Oh, that sounds great. You know, I got better stuff at my place. What you putting on there, huh? I'm not gonna watch that crap! What is your problem, huh? What is this bullshit? Goddamn! Oh, jesus, get that away! God, get out of here with that! I'm not gonna watch, are you sick or something? - I think you're gonna like this. - Yeah, the hell I will! - Shit. - I guess you didn't like that as much as I thought you would. - Fuck you. - I'm sorry? I didn't understand you. - Fuck you, you understand that? - Such a sweet talker, Frank. You must be a hit with the ladies! - What is your problem? - You! And everyone like you. - You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. - On the contrary, Frank, I know everything about you. - What is that supposed to mean? - Shh. It's my turn to ask the questions. Did you go out tonight planning on having sex with that girl? - No! - You're lying! Did you go out tonight and plan on having sex with that girl? - Alright, yes! Yes, you happy now you sick son of a bitch? - Yes! If you were who you want to be Would you stop praying on young girls? - Yes! - You see, I just don't believe you, Frank. - What do you want from me? - I want you to be a decent fucking human being! Are you up for it? - Yeah, I fucking can. - Guess you're not a coffee drinker. - Sorry, guess I should've told you he sleeps with a gun. - What the hell are you doing here? - Something nice, I thought. - Oh geeze. - Got a report from the hospital. Apparently someone with a gun shot wound to the crotch was left outside the ER this morning. - Was he dead? - How do you know it was a he? - Who would shoot a woman in the crotch? - Fair enough. And, no, he wasn't dead. - I'll drive. Forget about it, we gotta go fight crime, come on. - Yeah, clean really isn't in his vocabulary. Don't worry, you'll get used to it. - Alright, you're gonna take the lead on this one. - What? - You get to ask the questions this time. You know what questions are, right? - No, I don't know what questions are. - Well you can handle it, right? - Of course I can handle it! You think you can handle not opening your mouth? Mr. Miller-- - How you holding up, sir? - How do you think? That bastard shot my dick off! - Sir, we're sorry for the loss. I'm sure it's gonna put a huge dent in your dating life. - Fuck you! - No thanks, not my type, Mr. Miller. - Mr. Miller, I'm Detective Chance. I just need to ask you a couple questions about what happened. - What's to ask? Some guy drugs me, ties me up, forces me to watch gay porn, then shoots my dick off! What is so damn funny? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You should be. - Mr. Miller, is there anything you can tell me about your attacker? Did you recognize him? - No, the son of a bitch was wearing some kind of mask! - What about body type? I mean, was he short, tall, thin, stalky? - Hung? - You ever had somebody point a gun at your dick? - Um, no. Can't say that I have. - Well when you do come back and talk to me and tell me how much detail you remember about the guy! - So, you know it was a guy? - Of course it was a guy! He was waiting for me in the back of my van! He put a rag over my face! The fucker was strong! - That's all I have for now. If you can think of anything else, please, let me know. - So, uh, the mask, was it a turn on or? - It wasn't that kind of mask, asshole. - Alright, smiley, great seeing you. - Yeah, piss off, pecker wood! Oh God. - Well I took the lead, but you sure didn't keep your mouth shut! - That guy wasn't gonna give you anything, anyways. - Not with you antagonizing him! you laid up the Burkeeeee charm, he might've softened up a little. - Are you kidding me? The guy's a registered sex offender. He had several priors of assault, all toward females. - Yeah, well, he's still a human being! - Just because he has a pulse doesn't make him a human being. - Oh damn, that's horrible! - Cam? - Yeah? - What do you got for me, bro? - I have, um, I figured out where he's accessing the Friend List accounts from. - Well? - You're not gonna like it. - Try me! - He's accessing them from their homes. - What? - Yep, I told you you weren't gonna like it. - Perfect, so while these are tied up living all over the place-- - This guy's in the other room uploading photos and inspirational quotes? What a sick bastard. - It's, yeah, it's actually a pretty good way not to get caught. - Cam. - What? I'm just saying! - Alright, um, I'll check with forensics and see about the other victim's keyboards. - Oh wait! Burke, I'm a step ahead of you, man. Forensics checked it, the only prints on there are the victims. - Thanks Cam. - Absolutely guys. - Thank you, Cameron. - Come on. We've got to figure this out. There are clues all over the place. Um, um. He hates women's faces. - Not crazy about men's genitals, either. - He hates sex. - That was my ex wife. At least with me, anyway. - So we have a Shakespearean bully who likes to take out his vengeance on the people of Friend's List. Great. You know, this Shakespeare crap is bringing back nightmares from college. - See if Cameron's up. - Hello? - Cam? Wake up, I need something. - Dude, I'm sleeping, man. - Shut up you fifth grader, I already heard that video game on in the background. - Oh. Uh, what can I do for you? - Okay, I need you find the login and the password on the three victims that are on Friend's List. - Man, come on, why can't you ask them? - Oh, I didn't think about that. Well, one had half of her face melted off and she's in and out of a drug induced coma and the other two are looking for their dicks and they're not really in a chatty mood, you wanna help me out? - Touche. - Okay. - Alright. Okay, you ready for these? - Yeah, hold on. Okay, yeah, go. Uh huh. Uh huh, okay got it. Yeah, now go back to sleep you pathological bastard. - What ya thinking? - Well, I don't know. Why were all the victims left alive? Doesn't really fit the MO of someone who would plan to do something like this. - True. - But take a look at that. Do you notice anything? - She has a bunch of admirers? - Besides that. - She is allergic to clothes? - Very good. - What? - Besides the obvious. - I'm just not seeing anything malicious here, educate me. - Alright, let's start with the obvious then. Obviously she's a good looking girl, she probably gets asked out more times than she can even count. Why would she post all these things to attract more attention to herself from all these random strangers? Think. - Constant need for attention. - Exactly. Yeah, now. - What if she's actually looking for somebody and she's just going about it the wrong way? - Look closer. Look at how she responds when a guy sends her a message. See? - "Hey girl we should hook up." To which she responds, "Oh, yeah, maybe haha." - Hmm. - Okay, so she's not looking for her knight in shining armor. - Oh, you think? The question, Detective, is what do you see? - A decent boob job. - Agreed. Besides that. - Holy shit. You could case her whole house just by looking at these pictures. - Bingo. - Okay. Now I'm officially creeped out. - Usually in cases like this, what's the first thought? - Someone they know. - Exactly. Especially since the person took her back to her own place. Right? Now. Take a look at the pattern for Jeremy, okay? - It's like he copy's and pastes the same flirts to every girl on his Friend's List. - Let's check out this next animal. Alright, how old do you think Frank is? - 49. - 50. This charming and eligible bachelor has a cut off age of 20, sometimes even goes down to 15 year olds. - Gross. - Yeah. - I'm still not getting it, though. I'm failing to see the connection between the different victims, their ages, sexes, and patterns. - Exactly. - No, what exactly? - Exactly. - No, what does that mean? - It's time to go home. We got a big day tomorrow. - You're really not gonna tell me? - We'll talk about it tomorrow. Go home, Laura. - Can't! Got a hot date! - Don't forget your cuffs. - It's with Jamie. - Not to burst your bubble, but it is a school night for my daughter, you know that? - Don't worry. We're just gonna go catch the 8:00 showing of the new Channing Tatum movie. - Wait a minute, what's that rated? - I don't know. Whatever rating his butt is getting these days, a 10? - Good God. - Don't worry dad, I'll bring her straight home, scouts honor. - Oh my gosh, Channing Tatum is so hot. - How old are you again? - Old enough to know that Channing Tatum is so hot. - Yeah, he's pretty cute. - Pretty cute? That scene where he runs out of the locker room in his towel? Hot. - That's probably something you should leave out when your dad asks you about the movie. - Please, ever since him and my mom divorced, I've been taking care of him. So go ahead and ask, I know you're dying. - What? - My mom and dad. - Oh, that is really none of my business. - Oh, it's not a sore subject. My mom, she cheated on my dad with some loser from Friend's List and decided to blame it on my dad saying that he was married to his job and not her. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Like 90% of the kids at my school have divorced parents, so it's yeah. - Well, it's getting pretty late, we should probably get you home. - My dad, he's a really good guy. - I know he is. - Hey Laura? Thanks. - No problem, I love ice cream. - Not just that, just the whole night. You know, my mom, she isn't really big into girls night out so it's really nice to have someone to talk to. - Anytime, I love girls night. - No. Can I have a mirror, please? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Please? - I'll go get the doctor. - Please. I need to see. Please. - You need to understand, our doctors are doing amazing work with plastic surgery and skin graphs. When this is all over, you're gonna be as beautiful as ever. - Thank you. Can I have a glass of water, please? - Of course. - Code blue! Get a crash cart in here now! Where the hell's my crash cart? - This is Burkeee. Oh, good evening, doc. Oh, she did? I'm very sorry to hear that. - Thanks again. - Of course, I had fun. - Can we do it again some time? - We better. - Sweet. - See ya! - Did you have fun? - Yeah, it was great. - A little weird, you going out with your dad's partner. - Not really. - Hey. - Oh. - You coming to bed soon? - Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. - I thought tonight we could maybe... - Maybe. But you know what, we can't do anything out here. - Okay, well don't be long. - Okay. - Hey babe. - Where you going? - I'm sorry, my sister called. She's having a big drama with Tim, she's hysterical, I've gotta go over there and help her. I won't be long-- - At this hour, come on! - I'm sorry, darling, I just, I got to help her for just a little bit and then I'll be back. - I came home early, this is really frustrating. When is your sister gonna grow up and take care of stuff on her own? - Why don't you tell her that? - I would, you won't let me talk to her. - Look, she needs me tonight, she's always there for me, I got to go. - When, when is she always there for you? Honey, I came home early! - You know what, I'm gonna run over there, I'll be back in no time. You relax. I don't know what you want me to do, she's my sister. - I want you to come over here and go to bed with me. - I know. You know what, I promise I'll make it up to you. - Freeze! This is officer Downs, I got a 240 at the Four Corners Motel at the corner of 31st and second. Put your hands on the hood! - Officer Downs, we copy, three units your way. - You okay ma'am? - Yeah Alright, just stay put. Help is on its way. Put your hands on the hood! Freeze! Get down! - Listen, I'll be right back. - Okay, thanks. - Oh. - Hey, how's she doing? - Um, she's fine. She's a little shaken up. - Alright, thanks. - Don't even start with me. - Hmm. - So a parking lot, huh? - I said don't start. - I guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks after all. - Yeah, fuck you David. - Yeah that's usually your MO, right there. - Burke! Hey. Can I ask you a few questions? - Yeah. - Why don't you get out of here, grab a cup of coffee. - Yeah, I will. - Alicia, is there anything you can tell me about your attacker? - I don't remember much. I walked up to the car, next thing I know someone in a mask shoves a rag in my face and I'm on the ground. - Someone you were supposed to meet? - Um, yeah his name's Paul. - Have you met him before? - No, no we've only chatted on Friend's List. - Sir, you can't be in here. - I'm looking for my wife! - Oh God. - Hey, it's okay. They don't know anything. - And what am I supposed to tell them? - Well, you can tell them whatever you want, but sometimes the good of these situations is realizing the important things in life. - Mom, are you okay? - Yeah. I am. - Hi. - What? Did you get anything? - Just a name. - Cam, I got another name for you. - Hey Detective, sorry about tonight. - Yeah, I'd be sorry too if I got my ass kicked and my gun taken away from me! - Seriously, I'm sorry. - No, seriously you had the son of a bitch and you let him get away! All you got is sorry? - Burke, lay off! - What is this shit! Don't you have some paperwork you need to fill out? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah, you two, my office, now. Fucking rookie. That's it, four victims now and no leads. - We're getting close. - Close. We've got two guys in the hospital with missing dicks! We have one girl killed herself over what happened, and now your ex wife. You'll have to pardon me for not agreeing with you on your definition of close. - Just need a little more time, Captain, that's all. - Yeah, well you can have all the time in the world. Because as of right now, you're relived of duty. - Wait, seriously? - Consider yourself lucky that you are not going down with his sinking ship because you are being reassigned. - But sir, we are so close! - So close, that word "close" again, keep reverberating in my head, it's haunting me. I don't care! I've already got a new team reassigned. - Fuck. Oh man. - I know how you feel, man. I get the same way when fuckers cheat on Call Of Duty. - Shut up! - Fair enough, you can catch more bees with honey. - Shut up, dude, shut up! - Dad, come on. Dad! Come on, dad. Dad, seriously. Dad, wake up. Your phone's been blowing up all morning. - So what? I don't care. The only one I want to talk to is you. - Well usually when someone's calling from the same number, it means that it's important. Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad! - What, baby, what? - Wake up. - Okay. - Here. - Alright, you're an excellent wake up call. And a pain in my ass. Yeah, it is. Cameron, what is it? - Dude, your bedside manners need some serious help. - Dude, come on. What is it Cameron, just tell-- Get to the point. - Okay! Okay, what I was trying to tell you last night is that I found your connection between your victims and the name that you gave me. - Alright so tell me, what is it? - Well all the activity from the victim's computers after they were attacked are coming from the same IP address as this Paul guy. - Alright, I'm on my way over. Cameron, what is it? I'm on my way! - Cameron? - You got something to say to me, you son of a bitch? Go ahead, I'm listening. - Isn't social media wonderful? It brings us all so close together, lets people share their lives with complete strangers, making them friends. - Social media's great, for people like you. Spineless little fucking pricks who can hide behind their computers. - I don't expect you to see the bigger picture, here. You'd rather just sit there with your narrow view. That's okay, though. You will see soon enough. - Did you come after my wife, you son of a bitch? - Your ex wife, and you're wrong, she came to me. They all do. For the friendship they so sorely need. - I'm fucking coming after you. - Hey man. - Burkeeee! You're not even supposed to be here, man, the least can you do is knock. - What'd you find? - First of all, stop doing that! And B, I traced the phone call made to your cell from Captain Creepy Crunch. Belongs to the one and only Veronica Connelly. - Hey guys, what's going on? - You are just in time. - For what? - For this. That right there, the proud owner of the IP address that's causing all of this chaos. - Wait, Burkee! Look, I know you want to get this guy, I do too, but you can't just go busting in there! Especially since you're on leave! - Well, so what do you recommend? We just sit and wait for him to do it again? - No, we stake out his place and catch him with his pants down, so to speak. - Okay. Let's go. Pickles and pizza. Mhmm. - You really think this is the guy? I mean, it doesn't seem like he would do this. - That's what the partner of Ted Bundy's arresting officer said, too. - Shut up. So this is what you smell like when you shower with water and not with scotch, huh? - Nice, now you shut up. - I don't understand why he still leaves them alive. - Well, gives him power, you know? Serves his need to be in control and be feared, or whatever. Or he could just be trying to teach them a lesson. - This is Detective Laura Chance calling for back up at 147 Parkmans Street. We have a 261 in progress. - Help! - Hey! Are you okay, sweetheart? Come on asshole, come on, come on. Okay, you were a free man until now. Get up, get up. - I didn't do anything! - Really, why the hell were you running? - What would you do if some crazy asshole kicked in your front door waving a gun around? - Really asshole? Okay, you know what? You have the right to remain silent, you know how this goes right? Everything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. Now get up! Let's go. Come on, come on. - Hey, are you okay? - Just a little shaken up. - Get inside right now. - What the hell you asshole! - Okay, take her outside, get outside with her right now. Sit down! - I don't know what the fuck your problem is, but I'm gonna sue your ass. - Whatever you say, Paul, sit still. - Who the fuck is Paul? My name's James. - Oh that's right, Paul's just the name you use to lure unsuspecting victims? Or Jeremy? God only knows how many other profiles you've got. - What are you talking about? - I'll call Veronica right now, a friend of mine, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. Is she okay out there? - Yeah, she's okay. Just a little shaken up. - Don't move. Just what I thought, let's go wise guy. Get up, get up, this way. - What is that shit? - Looks like a conviction to me. - What are you talking about? I've never seen any of that. - Why don't you save your act for somebody who gives a shit, come on. - Captain, there you go, happy? - So you finally caught the son of a bitch, huh? - Sure did. - About time. - That's it, huh? - What do you want, a parade for doing your job? - Hey guys. Hey! So, why don't you come over for some dinner tonight with me and Jamie? I'm cooking. - You? cook? We talking solids? - I'll have you know I'm a pretty damn good cook. Plus my daughter's taken a liking to you for some reason. - Well, never underestimate the power of a girls night. - So what do you say? - Got nothing better to do. - Alright, I'll see you there. - Alright, I'll be there. - Oh and uh, good job out there. For a girl. - Asshole! - Cam, thanks for all the help. - Well you can thank me by not smacking the back of my head anymore. - Oh, sure. So you still checking on Connor for me or what? - Yeah, I am. Tying up some loose ends on that guys background check. - Easy, fucker. Any luck? - No, dude. The guy friggin sells Prius'! - What a bastard, huh? - Exactly, that's what I'm saying man. The dude's clean. Except for a few parking tickets, but other than that-- Actually, you know what, there is one exception. Some girl accused him of rape like seven years ago and ended up dropping all the charges and nothing ever came of it. - Got a name? - I do. - Karen Bligh, 18 years old at the time, freshman at blah blah blah university. - I should talk to her about it. - Yeah, somebody should. Except for the fact, good luck finding her. She's probably the only person on the planet without a Friend's List account. She didn't end up showing up after the case and she's probably married somewhere with like two point five kids. - Hey, more power to her, right? Listen, do me a favor, keep looking for a picture to put with the name and if you find any, just let me know, okay? - Will do. - Thanks, brother. - Hello? - I'm in the kitchen, come on in. - Wow! You weren't kidding were you? - No, never doubt my abilities. I'm the chef. - Never would. Where's Jamie? - She'll be here any minute. - Hey, I just came straight from work so I'm gonna go clean up a little bit. - Okay, you know where it's at. - So what you making? - What? - I just asked what you're making. - Oh, it's a surprise. - Oh, a surprise. Aren't you full of surprises? - Here. Have a glass of wine. It'll be done soon. It must feel good, you finally put your old friend behind bars, huh? - Old friend? - Yeah, what's his name? Some guy named James? - I'm not sure I follow. - Went to college with him. - Had to keep digging, didn't you? Couldn't just be happy finally closing a case. Guess I should'nt have underestimated you. - Tell that story, what happened, huh? What happened? James smooth talk you a little bit, huh? Did he invite you to dinner? What happened, did he get a little rough with you? First date, huh? So you decided to take it out on everybody on Friend's List. - A little rough? A little rough? Here I thought I met this nice guy. On the internet of all places and even though my family warned me about it, I defended him. I defended him before we even met! Told them all about the sweet things he wrote me and all that bullshit. After a nice dinner he takes me back to his place where he blindsides me, ties me to a bed post and he-- All the while taking humiliating-- All the while taking humiliating photos just so he could share 'em with his buddies later. - Should've enjoyed it, at least he bought you dinner. Sound better than what my ex wife did to me. - That's not very rough! Always the comedian. - So one guy does that that gives you the right to start punishing innocent people? - Innocent people? You think I'm the only one who's ever fallen victim to their lies and manipulative bullshit on there? I see it every day. Guys arrogantly praying on girls. Single, married, underage, doesn't matter. Girls egging them on by posting their slutty little attention getting photos! Wives cheating on their husbands all because of their innocent posts, comments, status updates. - I guess you're not a fan of the first amendment, huh? - I'm a supporter of being a decent fucking human being! - Clearly. How you gonna explain this one? - Shouldn't be too hard. An alcoholic cop whose cheating wife was found almost cheating again. Opens an old wound. And you just get sick about it all. Does that sound right? - My baby, hold my hand. Come on, baby. What baby, my baby's gonna be okay. - I'm not really an expert at getting shot. - I know. - But one thing's for sure. - What's that baby? - I'm definitely unfriending her. - I don't know if I can even blame her. After what that asshole put her through. I know she grew on you. But we'll take good care of her. - Don't worry, Ms. Chance. We're gonna take really good care of you here. We even have the newest movies. Supposedly there's a new one coming out soon called, "Friend's List Killer". It's kind of creepy, if you ask me. Somebody using Friend's List to stalk their victims. It makes you think twice about what you put up on the internet these days. I really think you're gonna like it here. - What is this? "Mercy is for the--" I'm getting too old for this shit. "Weak." What the fuck does that mean? Beth!
