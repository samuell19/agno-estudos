LIFE AND NOTHING MORE I'm not doing this again. I'm fucking done. I'm done. I'm here. Do you see me? I'm here. I'm fucking done. You get the fuck away from me. Move! Move. You don't want to move? Get the fuck and stand up, for all I care. Your Honor, that's a very poor excuse. He had no problem break into cars, so he need to make sure you keep in track of his counsel appointments and I then hear the excuse, "Well, I have a transportation issue now." While he had no problem getting to the area to break into these cars but now, he's having a problem getting to his counseling sessions. And his mom is on probation. He's on probation. - Is he telling you he's going to counselling? - Yes, sir. This is my first time hearing that he hasn't made not one appointment. Any questions at Ms Williams from either the state or the defense? - No, Your Honor. - Not from the state, Your Honor. The officer look, then said, "What you mean, it's a problem but you give me the dope." You must want these charges to stick to me. But I got to search you, I'm going to get this dope and I'm going to put this on you. Even though it's based on love, I still won't do it. Then I said, "No, that's the problem because every time I pull this dope out, it ended back in my pocket." Said the officer, "Look, no way. What do you mean it ends up back in your pocket?" You know... But the officer is blowing at this time, right? So, once they get it, especially when I flush it down in the toilet, I flush it down the toilet, it's definitely going to be back in my pocket. So the other officer, "Man, do you believe this shit?" Do you believe this shit? Like man, I don't know man. He said, "Man, let me see that dope, man." So Marc go down his crotch, in his pants. He come up with dope. He gives it to the officer and the officer say, "You're tellin' me, if I flush this dope right now, it's going to appear back in your pants?" He looked at them and say, "That's exactly what I'm telling you." So the officer throw in, and totally flush... He goes out in a journey, right? Wait a few seconds... The officer looked down and said, "So, where the dope at?" And Marc was like and say, "What dope?" Man, so we got away. Man, he had ammunition or cocaine or drugs on them, right man? We got away man, but I was young then. Marc was 15. I was 17, man. What I was saying is I was 17 at the time. But at the time of 18, man, I'm going to prison, man because of the stupid decision to go make a little fast money, you know what I mean? That was based on decision that you make. You at that age, man, well you got to start making better decisions for yourself. I know your pops ain't in your life, you know, you got your little sisters and your Momma, you know, man and got them middle thing in your life and I went the same way. I went the same way, so when I say I feel your pain, I feel your pain. I talk to you like this because I got love for you but toy with the love, I'm going to destroy the love, so I want to build with you. And the thing is, when I learned... that somebody not being in my life was going to make me stronger and motivate me more to be a better father for my kids in the future, I took it upon myself to make that decision... to be better and strive... for excellence, for perfection, you know? And I ain't perfection in other eyes of man but as long as you're there for your mother and your little, younger sibling, you're perfect, man. You're excellent. That's a lot of decisions and a lot of people that ain't do. Your father ain't do and my father ain't do. You know, I tell my little sister, you know? I say, my father ain't shit because when time got hard, he split like chapped lips, you know what I mean? He disappeared on us. I realize suddenly, as love of pictures flowed through my head, I saw myself as a grown man and I have become rich and famous. I had a fancy house and an expensive car, and a lovely family. Then I saw my Momma right in front of me, she was beaming with pride over my achievements. She begged into me, want me to come and give her a hug. I hurry for her, splashing through water that came to my knees, my waist and my chest. "I'm coming Momma..." I thought you be all here. I don't understand why you've... me to get you. I don't understand. You thought you're suspended, I've been to court with you all day, have to go and right to come home to this bullshit. Clean it up now! Like you do a fucking part in here. And we find out you got your little buddies over here. - I never need to know... - There going not be over here. All right. What your fucking mouth. And you better not wake up my baby.? You need two rakes. If you guys like to receive the gift that God has for you today, say this with me with your heart and lips out loud. - Dear Lord Jesus. - Dear Lord Jesus. - Come into my heart. - Come into my heart. - Forgive me on my sin. - Forgive me on my sin. - Wash me and cleanse me. - Wash me and cleanse me. Set me free, Jesus. Set me free, Jesus. - Thank you that you died for me. - Thank you... - I believe that you are risen from the dead. - I believe that... - And that you're coming back again for me. - And that you're coming back again... - Fill me with the Holy Spirit. - Fill me with the... - Give me a passion for the loss. - Give me a passion... - A hunger for the things of God. - A hunger for... - And holy boldness to preach the gospel. - And holy boldness to preach the gospel. - Of Jesus Christ. - Of Jesus Christ - I'm saved. I'm born again. I'm forgiven. - I'm saved. I'm born again. I'm forgiven. - And I'm on my way to heaven. - And I'm on my way to heaven. - Because I have Jesus in my heart. - Because I have Jesus in... I can tell you as a minister of the Gospel, if you did die right now, you go to heaven because you ask Jesus in your heart. Remember, if you make a mistake, don't run from God, run to him because he loves you and he's got an awesome plan for you. All right, nice to meet you, man. All right. God bless. Thank you. And listen, we're giving away some... Got some free bags of food at church if you want. But just come on out. They want to see you, man. Yeah, I think about it a lot. What I think about... where she could have been and how she could have been and she could have been in college right now, you know? And I also think about is too that the opportunity that she could have that she don't have now, you know I'm saying? So I'm just saying that... you take heat to... that because you can lose your life just like this, you know what I'm saying? And when you lose your life, you don't coming back. Once you're gone, you don't coming back. Stupidity is one thing that you will lose your life. So... In general, you just need to take one at a time, stay out of trouble. Please, stay out of trouble. That's why... this man let me brought you with us this morning, so we can get you out the streets. Your Mama said that you need to get out of the streets. She's afraid that one night she go and get a phone call and they will tell that you're dead. So if there's one thing that you can take from me today, whether you come back and you work with us again, I'm sure we could use you. But whatever it is that you do, work hard for what you want. Just go on. Andrew, what the fuck? She just grabbed the knife. And you just hit her. She grabbed the knife. She could have cut herself. I understand that but don't hit her like that no more. Bad. The knife was bad. Stop from holding. Stop. Stop. Okay? Andrew was right. He was right. You can't, you know that. Okay? So you know, when you were asking me about getting in trouble and who the person that I am? That's why I fit for the job because I've been exactly where you're at right now. In denial and in the situation where I was following the bad and the footsteps of folks that were supposed to be guiding and lead me, which were my parents. You talk like you know my family is something. I know your family is locked up. I know that. I know that people who are incarcerated have got me in trouble. Yeah, but you don't know what happened. I don't have to know what happened. I know the end result. And that was most important. Because we can get through what actually happened but at the end of the day, are you free, dead or in jail? Those are three consequences. So when you say, "I talk like that," I know you and I know your folks, I do. - I know that they're convicts. - You don't. And I know I'm trying to keep you from being a convict. - You ready to go? - Yes. Open the door. Mommy... Go to bed. Mommy. The whole reason that those leaders have power at all is because of this idea of popular sovereignty. Now, the three words in the constitutions that tell me that have the power are, "We the people," as the first three words of the constitution and they are the biggest words on the page because they are by far the most important aspect to different words of the constitution that 'we the people' are going to have the power within this new government that we are creating. So what do you think of the Pledge of Allegiance? You can say the Pledge of Allegiance for me. - Go ahead, Robert. - I pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible... Tell me the people live in your house with you right now. - Just three. - Three? Who are those three people? Me, my mom and my sister. Okay. You, mom and sister. And how old is your little sister, again? - Three. - Three years old. Okay. I notice that you didn't mention dad's name. How is your relationship with dad? - I don't really have one. - You don't have one, what was that? - He's locked up. - Okay. You know, what he is incarcerated for? I believe it was uhm... Aggravated assault, something like that. Okay. Okey-dokey. How often do you talk to dad? Not very often. He writes but... Okay, so he does write you. Uhm, would you like to talk to him more often? Uhm... Sure. Are you sure? You didn't sound too confident about that? Uhm... Yeah, yeah. Yeah? You will like to talk to him more often? Okay. All right. All right. Tell me this, Andrew. Who are some of your role models? - Well, I got a surprise for you. - What? Close your eyes. Don't open it yet. Close your eyes. Now open. Calm down. You should calm down. It's okay. It's okay... Man, we trip. Hey, hey, you're a little lady. I am no fucking with that shit. It's like a little bitch. Man, you trippin', bro. You meant to leave me… … - I don't need... - You need some money. Yeah, I want some money but I want to stay out of fucking courthouse. Man, we move into courthouse, man. Unless you're planning in getting a job. Oh, I bet I tell you, one gunman. You feelin'? I am. But yeah, man, I give mostly what I get man. Tomato slices and coleslaw? Yes, sir? Yes, ma'am. Sorry, we'll be right up. You're welcome. And what am I supposed to tell? I wish he ask for her to end. But please, you can't beat yourself up about it. He may be get to you. She needs you. She needs your support, you know? So, we're gonna need you, also, to get to get it together mentally, honey. I understand you're hurting but that baby go need you more now than ever, you know? Maybe we can do a little girl's night out or something. - Get your mind off things. - I know, one night... - And I got to wake up and just saying, bullshit. - Yeah, that's true. - That's the life. We're moms. - That's it, girl. That's life. You know, unfortunately, we can't just not there if something end up in the clinic, at some baby's hospitals, therefore you going to have to take care of it, you know? I wish I can knock him up in a different kind of way. - Why would you? - You know... I don't know baby like... you had a... and you're doing a great job, though. You know, you work. You got your house and holding that down, regardless of child support. That's why, Miss Independent. So he could try to run but he kept right on running, you go get paid in the end. - That's all right, baby. What goes around, comes around. - Right. It looks hard in a tunnel looks far away. The light at the end of the tunnel but you keep walking. I'm talking about to take one foot at a time, day-by-day, baby. They has no choice but it come your way. ...29th consecutive victory against the conference opponent and not bad for a team that their coach says, "It isn't even playing their best football." Yeah, they're young team and they're on the collision course with friends in the NCC right now, if you think about it and maybe I doubt it, maybe... ...They're a dangerous team and it's gets dangerous because of the option. You see a lot of that they got to a ball game for 18 straight years... - I appreciate it. - That's no problem. It's all about them babies. We're going to make it happen. All goodness, my car might be in the shot in this. I know. All we can do is pray by the end, you know. That's the best we can do. I'm trying to work. That's all I can do right now. - I bet she's going to it... - She is? That's good. That's real good. - I just want to say that we're gonna leave one day. - Oh, really? Right. I don't dread them days, but Lord I had still what I had then still, so when the time does come… So when the time does come, I made a few mistakes, so when I was around his age, you know but... if we get in trouble in this age, they keep you in the system. So you're standing asking some question, how long have you work here? Now, why I ask is because you... I'm not from Missouri and we're tying to... after we get on, we try to go somewhere to hang out. - So... - Oh! I'm trying to find somewhere where I can go and chill, you know? You're talking to the wrong one of them. - Why don't you go out? - No, I don't know. - So what you do, what? Work and...? - And work. - You know, Rihanna, work, work, work, like that. - Okay. So you must got a proud man? A woman that comes home... have to work and... don't party? Don't go out? I know you're not from around here. I'm not going to blame you but... my thing personally, fuck the man. Why fuck the man? Why-Why do you feel like that? - Do you have any kids? - Why do you question me? I was asking because you said, "Fuck the man," doesn't like... Hold on on that bacon quarter. - Yes, thank you. - Is it...? You have mission or something? I'm just trying to know you, you know? I ain't trying to get in advantage but you know, I'm just curious. - Oh, is that me? - That's you. - Yes, ma'am. - If you like anything else, I have ketchup, - This is so good. - I'm talking about, if you need steak sauce. - No, I don't need no steak sauce. - I'm going to make sure that you have everything you need. - I'm just trying to be... - Anything else? I'm just trying to get to... - get to, get to know you. - Have fun tonight. You never told me where I can go hang out then. Thank you, ma'am. No problem. Can you hold on to my phone? Oh, yeah. I got you. Be careful. I mean if the machine shop repair are as much as I had figure on the bill there, we can take some off. Maybe $100 or $200 off of it. - Is it subject to go up, though? - No, ma'am. Best eyes are going to be there. - Okay. You guys towed my car in... - Yes, ma'am. - Is it possible to tow us somewhere else? - We can, yes ma'am. You can call them and give them an address. We can do that. Okay. This looks great and there's no charge, right? Actually, it'd be $55 to have it tight. If you don't have a repair, it would be $55. Do you mind if I sit down? It's a free country. Have a seat, have a seat. Let me move my coffee. Here you go. What was really going on there? - Living. - Just living? So when are you going to let me, you know what I'm saying, you know? When we go - When are you going to let me going like take you out like actually? You got to see the last time, you know, we talk... No, you talk. Well, what I was talking, you told me, basically, you made a statement about fuck the man, so I was just trying to wonder what do you mean about it? What do you think it means? You know, I guess I hasn't thought, I mean, of that particular person. No, no ain't person on that. Men. Well, what would you say that? - The man really... - Because that's my opinion. - Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. - Yeah, you're right, you're right. To experiences. But as like me saying, "Okay, I meet a person, a nice person, they're trying to..." Get to know me or whatever and I say, fuck all women, I understand it's kind of inappropriate. Yes, because you say you met a nice person that's trying to get to know you, then you say, "Fuck all women." But as, you know, in a way, that's kind of rude by... But that's your opinion, at the same time. - Yeah, yeah. - You know? At this point, you're pushing on me. I say, fuck all men, so what that mean? - So... - Get the fuck lost. Ten minutes. Just one thing I want to know. Yeah? I'll wait. So... I bet you like cold dancers. You like cold dancers? - What? - What's your name? - What's my name? Oh, so... - Like you like cold dancers. - Really, you and I... - You want me to do you a nasty dance. - Oh, you don't have to do that all... - You damn right, I don't have to do that. - Oh, I'm not the type of person. - So what do you want, Robert? I'm just, I mean, I'm just trying to take you all night. That's all. Hopefully, you know, somewhere special, if that's okay. I told you, I like what I see, so... what's wrong with a man coming on a woman that they like them? I mean, there's nothing wrong with it but what if the woman don't like you? You know, like you said, that's your own decision. - You having kids? - Yeah, I have kids. - How many? - I have two. - That's beautiful. - How about you? - I do. - You too. Yeah, that's one of those questions you asked, I would have thought that would have been one out to be a man trying to get to know a woman. No, I'm not that type of man. But it seem like to me, you're a man trying to get what a man can get. No. One thing about me, I work hard, I do what I suppose to do for my kids, I make sure they were taken care of. Basically, what I work for. I'm just trying to, you know, spend some time with you, if you, you know, allow me to do that when I have my free time or if you have... I don't have free time. Oh, so basically you are 24/7? Yeah. Seven days a week? When I'm off from working. Well, yeah, I was there when you said you were a single parent, so... I understand that but... all I'm asking is for, what? Couple of hours. What do you want to do in this couple of hours? Maybe we could go out, catch a movie. Get some dinner or something. What do you like to do? Nothing. Go home. So you're the boring type, then. If that's what you want to call me. Nah, I ain't call you that because you know, I'm trying to ask you, you know? No. I call irresponsible. Irresponsible people, you know that, like what I am saying. Maybe they do, so I'll have a life. My life is working my kids. - No. - Yes, you are. Come on. Hush and let's go. Hold it up. Hold it up. Come on, have your bag and let's go. Come on. - ...TV on when I get home. - Fuck that. I wake up in the morning and see what on there... I'm tired of hearing it like and I have so many customers, they just come in here, Trump, Hillary, Trump, Hillary. - I'm like, you know what? - Yeah, fuck at that. I just want to wake up in the morning and say that who won in a country and hope we still have a fun country. The country is so far in the hole right now. That's my opinion on it. - Right, it don't matter who you... - Yeah, a lot of work to do. After taking my break, I'm ready to go. Seafood or Shona's? And after that, you know, pool is up, you know, if you like. - Okay, sounds good. - Sound good. So, how was your day? - Okay. - Let's get it up. You had the ball in? Two ball, straight down. - Damn! - It would be really nice. How are you doin', Robert? - How are you doing? - Actually, good. - Talk to your lady? - Yup. I try to talk to them every day, like cool, you know? When their mama, allowed me to, so you know you all how women are. Sometimes, you all got to, you know, have a little abative side, be a little abative. But other than that, everything is good. Don't put it on the women. Why not? Have you had a blame on somebody, right? Yeah. I guess. How was your son? - My son is just fine. - Yeah? - He's just fine. - Oh, yeah? Uhm. Rob, how old are you? Really? So you'll come at me like that? I just want to know. I'm 39. How old are you? Since we all know something. You know it's rude to ask a woman about her age. That's the rules. Now, I'm upset. So, it's okay for a woman to ask a man his age but we can't ask up? Come on, now. I'm just curious. I just told you. So you won't tell me? - Okay... - Well, let me guess then. I'm some kind of guesser. Go ahead. I have all night. I'm going to say, 32. Am I close? If you make your next ball, I just might hit you. All right, that's some bad there. Uhm. Watch it now. They'll start. Watch it. Don't be trying to cheat, Robert. Setup. You just helped me out, baby. You got any plans for next week? I got to say, my last relationship, you know, it went, you know kind of sideways but that's the past, so... What do you... What do you want from me? I want to get to know you. Basically, you know, be a friend to you. Hopefully, more. So can I ask you this? What do you really think about me? Be honest. Because you know, our last talk, you say, "-lala-you are stopping this, da-ra-ra-ra." I don't know, you know, it was like kind of hilarious but, you know... I was thinking about that a whole while, when I was going home. So, really, what do you think about me? I think that you just may be a genuine man but... There's a part of me that also think that you're full of shit and that you're here, - for two months, trying to get what you can. - Nah... Good night. Good night. See, we got some alligators... And we don't want to watch it. They were long story but the alligators just pop right up... - Where's the gator? - I don't know, honey. - Mama? - Uhm? - I just need it. - - state protective list... - Did you get it? - - The reason they're on the state protective list is because they taste really good... - Good job. - - So humans have been eating that. Here is called the brown water snake. I have a... Water snake. - That's what he said. - But I'm wondering... - Can I play with it? - Come on. Say good night. - Can I have my drink? - Okay, well, have your drink. - Can I play with your robot while you have your drink? - Yeah. What does it do? Do he talk? No. He don't talk. Quiet? What does he do? Because you don't have any batteries. Oh, well, I'll get you some, okay? Don't know other men, though? Well, I know. How would you know? Maybe, if you give me time to show you what type of man I could be, then you will know what it's like you're questioning me when I'm not the guy you should be questioning. Do you understand what I'm saying? Why shouldn't I question you? I mean, you come in the house and try to, build a sort of relationship with my mom. I just... She's a beautiful woman, so why wouldn't I do that? As basic... Nobody really want my mom. Gina? Was always this going to be the talk when I work at night? I guess so because... I just want to know who my mom is dating with. Break! Andrew, how you doing? I hope you're doing good and carry yourself like the young man. I'm doing fine. That crosses my mind to write you but I just can't figure what level to approach one because you're so young. I know you are intelligent enough to comprehend but I figure I should keep things simple until you're old enough to fully understand these things that I need you to know. I read a lot of different books and try to educate myself more and more every day. Education is one of the few things no one can ever took away from us. That's why it is so important that you pay attention to do good in school. I look at your pages all the time. Why do you look so serious? Photos last a lifetime. You should smile more. I spend a lot of time being serious in this place but I still find moments and reasons to smile. My situation in my environment keep me in a serious state of mind most of the time. You know, being away from you is not the way I want things to be but as a man, I have to play the cards I was dealt. As far as you and I see or hears for me is then maybe one day, you will be able to answer that question for you self. I'll be doing everything in my power to be a positive influence in your life over the course of the next seven and half years and beyond. This place, there isn't much I can do to reach you but write letters. So, if these letters I write, and the books I send reach you, I need you to sit down, take your time in reading them. I'm not doing this to pass time. I'm doing this because it is my responsibility as your father and a black man to feed you knowledge and put your mind on a positive track moving forward. What is your least favorite subject to school and why? Mine was science only because everything started out complex. Everything was based on observations and experiments. We have to form hypothesis and search for solutions. That's just made my head spin because I never really sat down instead, to try to figure it out. You might feel the same way once we started to build, so we would take our time. I've been trying to establish a system of communication with you for the past few years but Regina just don't get it. Tell your mother, you want to write me and sit down and write me. Just let me know how you are doing. I have a lot of stuff I want to say to you. Love you, son. Take care, Dad. See you later. - All right. You have a good evening. - You too. - We see you tomorrow, Ry'nesia. - All right. You got to feed her right up. - You want to feed her right up? - Yeah. Feed her right now. Oh, like a baby. - You too drawing your heart for your momma? - Yeah. - But you're all right, bro? - I'm good. You know, straight. Because some other dolls, you know, that's what they say they want from me. Yo, I am really sorry about last night. First of all, it wasn't harder. We just had a little discussion, that was that. Why, to me, it sound like a full-fledged work. No, it's not like that, man. You know, I've putting out on your mom, we're just talking, basically. She said, she said. I said, what I said and... we live with what we live, you know? That's what grown folks do sometimes. Don't let it happen again. What do you mean by that? Do you remember, I'm talking to you? You want to just walk off? See that's your problem right now. But do you know what? I'm just letting your mama talk to you. I'm not even going to say that. You think I love waking my kids up because I had to argue with you? Or any man? Hell, no. He's not used to it, neither am I, so right now, we need to get this clear because you still have a chance I opt out. You signed up for this, something you obviously can't deal with. - I'm not saying that. Did I say that? - That's what you want to say. Now Andrew this and Andrew that. I don't need to hear about the problems. My thing is, what I need to hear about is what the hell you're bringing to this house, right here? The hell you lay your head at. The bed you're lying beside me, the same air that I breathe, you breathe. That's what I need to hear about. All the other shit, ain't got nothing to do with me. It's all I'm trying is you get to see. Because I love you. - What we've been discussing last night. - - Uhm? - - Was last night. - It was. - So we just need to... - But it's something that I don't have to deal with again. Then we won't then. Don't you just say anymore? Trust that I do this for the kids. Could you do that? Please? And you say to him? I know... - I know you want me. - Yeah, so... So why can't they just say, "Hey, yeah, we're together." They can't. There's a suicidal, kind of primitive game that they're playing, right? Thank you. I think you're going to be right here. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray; Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again. You kiss by the book. How do you feel about this plot? I want to watch it. No, but seriously, how do you- Does it move it you at all or not really? - It feels like you get just them. - I feel like they got connection. Really? All right, some of the threes... You want to share some with me? Yeah. You got to sit down. - You want to try one now? - Yeah. - I wrote that one. - You wrote that small one? - Yeah. - Why do you want the small one? You got to blow it. You have to blow it. Give it a blow. You got to see if it's hot first. All right. And you had blow all it too now. Make sure you blow them. Good? This is called Cold World. - Here? - Yeah. - Cold World. - Uhm. Because it is the cold world for a young man. This cold world will chew you up and spit you out. If you believe anything, believe that without a doubt. View from bottom to the top looks so far away. Take one foot out to the other, day after day and he has no choice except to come your way. The higher you climb, you'll began to feel afraid of heights. You're afraid to look back, sort of man on track. Obstacles are expect to arrive in due time. Just keep your head up and remember no crying. I was ever told your soul but you're never too old to accomplish your goal and don't you lurks around every corner but if you're serious, your face will line up. Eyes fight, caught, bloated and centered on the beholder. He hopes to deliver. Unless we can come up with something. I'll try. This is how it started all. Deeply rooted in the darkness of my skin, just a pinch of cinnamon and a hint of... Gina. - Oh, you got them. - You know, I was thinking the same thing but if Gina is cinnamon, what am I? - Oh, damn... - You know what, I'm done. - You glad... - No, I was thinking the same thing and then you said it like... No. So that piece is kind of wrong? No, no, no, I'm not wrong. But I'm going to think about it. But I think you should, you know, at least try, go back to school then. I work full time. You need some milk? No, thanks. I forgot I already have enough help. - You found it? - Yeah. Good thing you ain't tried to call her? What was this, was he late for hours? Come on. Go. Where's Andrew? I don't know. Go ahead. You sure you don't need any help? I have help, thank you. Stand up. What do you mean you have help? I have help right here. You got stuff all over the floor. Everything. Why Andrew just didn't come here to clean up. What if the laws themselves are unfair? What if the laws favor one powerful group over another? That's a good question and no, that would then mean, no, you're not free. That would mean that that's an illegitimate law that needs to be changed and you can take it to the extreme that they did and say all the laws are unfair. The whole system is unfair. - You straight? - Yeah, I'm straight. I'm not hungry at all. So what's wrong. Nothing. No, he's not mad as any ways. It's time to go. Well... I know that you're like that and you just crashed over here but... if you need anybody to just talk to, I'm here. Is it okay to just leave without signing here today? Thank you. - How many you have... Two I think, I saw. - Uhm. I get it. How old are they? 14 and 3. I know... - I'm just, you know, trying to get thinking... - Right. You know, all women, when they first find out they're pregnant... think this is not the right time. This is not the right place, all right, anything because it's a huge change in your life and... different people make different decisions. The decision is entirely up to you, okay? It is. You're thinking about, what? Keeping it or...? Or what? I'm just, you know-I'm just-I'm just trying to find out what we're going to do right now. It's like no shit like that again. I'm not trying to upset you, baby. Well, please don't because if you ask something like if I'm going to keep it or not and I know what I'm going to do. But I said that you made that an option. No, I'm not trying to make it an option. I'm just asking you. So I can know what I have to do. That's all what I'm trying to say. Well, what if I decided to not keep it. What are you going to do? What do you mean? I'm still going to be here. Well, if you going to keep it or not, I'm still going to be here. Was he listening on us while we're talking some shit? So you're going to keep it? - Hold up, man. Hold on. Hold on. - No, no, no, no. - We're not going to do... - First of all... - We're not going to do this. - - some bullshit like that. Why are you so aggressive? Calm down. - Why would you be questioning... - Calm down. Why are you so aggressive? - I told you man, I'm tired of your fucking bullshit. - Let go of my child. - Watch out of your shit, dude? - Stop it! - Oh, you got a fucking knife at me? - Hell, yeah. - You got a fucking knife at me? - Don't do this, son. Don't-don't do it. - You will cut me yourself? - Hell, yeah. - Dude? - I need you to leave. - Leave for what? - I need you to fucking leave. I want him to cut me. I want to see what he's going to do... - No! - - with the fucking knife. Get out. - Get out. - You have motherfuckin'... The fuck you get a knife from? Get out. You know what, I ain't going to deal with this bullshit, man. I really don't. I don't-I don't got to do this. The fuck you get a knife from? Let me hold this shit. Let me fucking hold it. Give me the fucking knife. Well, after you had that motherfuckin' knife in your hand, I beat the fuck out your ass. Now, get the fuck out. You ain't got to worry about me if I'm fucking coming back here. So how do you go and take care of this baby, you damn sure better decide that right deal to do. Right now? - It's been decided. - - You kick me the fuck out? It's been decided, we had this conversation. If you can take that, which is obviously you can't, well, you got to do the fuck you got to do. You're going to defend him easy, for one that's why I say, he's no never change, - he's going to do... - You make me like denying on you or something. Because the simple fact you continue to baby his ass. - I'm not babying... - It always be a fucking... I'm not babying him at all. I'm nearly trying to raise a motherfucking man is what I'm doing. - Hey, no man... - Learn how to handle that situation at all. - Hey, no man... - Learn how to handle that situation at all because if you were, you would calm your ass down, so that we could have a casual conversation. Okay, I can calm my ass down but your child come in and go off for me. No, that was not-No, I talked to him about. That's right, at least. You... You fucking stupid! You could have killed somebody with this shit. I've been walking all motherfucking night and I have to be at work. What do you want? What the fuck do you want from me? Robert is gone. You run off with a knife. What do you want, Andrew? You don't want nothing. This is your fucking life, you fucking nut. Not mine. I'm here. I'm here for you. You need to get your shit together. Been all fucking night like you run- You don't pay no bills around here. Take your ass to your room. - You say... - Shut the fuck up. Say one more got them word. Get your ass in there. God, this temperature just dropped down here. Hey, I saw you interested, you got to try it. - I need it and I want a new job. - Yeah? Hey, bro, let us talk to you, bro. Stop him. Stop him. Stop him. Next time, bro, don't do it no more. Bet it would be worse than that. - Fuck you. - Oh. I work hard, had to pay the bill, dependable, flexible and I'm ready to work. You got to do what you got to do. What you have in here? - A resume. - Oh, okay. Okay. Thank you. - I already submitted this online, so... - I had it just want to make sure. I appreciate, good looking. I appreciate it. Uhm, let's see here. You say you have children, single mom and everything like that, so what schedule do you work mostly when you'd be at Red Onion. - Mornings and evenings. - Mornings and evenings. Okay. Here, we offer a custodial position and the hours rotate. They rotate from nights to weekends to some mornings. I couldn't necessarily promise you anything but we're definitely try to work around your schedule, your availability. - Okay. That's okay. - Is that okay? Okay. All right. Aside from your personal background, tell me a little bit about your educational background. I graduated high school and I have some college experience but I didn't finish and yeah, been working ever since, though. Where you go to school, then, if you allow me asking. - Lively. - Lively? Not bad. Not bad. It's right next to the DCC, if I'm not mistaken. Okay. All right. Okay, thank you. She's not in there. There she is. You better get out of that closet. Now, you have to find me. You count. Close your eyes. Count to five. - One... - Stop cheating. Two... Two... Three... Four... Five. Here I come. Mommy? You got me. You got me. Okay, we do you one more time. One more. I'm going to give you one more time. One, no. You're cheating. That was too big in there, to find you. Come on. One... Two... No, you can't go on the same place. Are you going to that, to the same hiding place? One... Two... Three... Five. So that's why I asked to let go. I understand that. I asked you to let it go until, you know, we can get it... dealt with. So otherwise, what? That's what I'm trying to figure out, Gina. What...? What's wrong to you? To see you. - What I thought you say, we needed our space. - I did say that. How long has it been? It doesn't even matter. Because right now, it'll look like I shouldn't be here. All I'm saying, I took my-I took your advice. All I'm saying is if you have something to tell me, please do. I don't have a shit to tell you. All I'm saying I'm just, you know, I'm enjoying myself right now. - Okay. - You know? I don't slow down on drinking so basically, I'm just trying to be happy, so... If that's a damn problem, you know, I... I mean, this your house. I don't have a problem with it. I guess I came to see you. If you don't want to talk to me, I'll leave. You ain't talking me at all. You know what I'm saying. You ain't... telling me what you're really here for. - That's what I'm trying to... - I just say to reconcile this relationship, stop beating around the bush. Please? If that's not something you want, just let me know. I don't think it's going right, Gina. You know, you-Come on, man. Look at-look at all the shit even more. Really. We go to fussin' because of your son. You kick my ass out because of your son. - Your temper. I couldn't calm you down. - No. You can say what you want. I say, how you feel at this point but you know exactly why I put you out. I didn't have nowhere to fucking go but you did-did you think of that? Don't fuss at me, please because it's like you got a tone, so do I and I can take it that but you took me down already. If you don't think it's going to work, fine. Now what? So what you going to do about the baby? Why are you worried? - Just asking. - Why are you worried? Well, fuck it, you know... - You don't want to tell me. It is what it is. - It is. That's exactly what it is. Now, let me hold it. Hello? I don't care what you eat tonight, baby. Just go and have a seat. You see that your recovery is about 30 to 45 minutes or so. We'll send you to the restroom before you get out here just to check your bleeding. Now, if your pads is completely soaked or your cramps get worse instead of better, make sure you let us know, okay, before you get out here so we can let the doctor know. Now for the next two weeks, make sure you do follow and take some instructions. No sit down baths, no sex, pads only, monitor temperature about a week or so. If it goes over 100.4 for the four hours, that could be a sign of infection, so make sure you give us a call and then just really watch your bleeding. If you have questions, let me know, okay? I'll go get the doctor, he'll begin with your ultrasound and then, if you want to do the procedure, we'll schedule that second appointment for you, okay? Okay. My son had a miscommunication. It would not happen again. I can sure you that. - I ain't... - No, what you need to do is get your motherfucking mind right in handling your business as a young man. - That's my mind is. - Your fucking mind fucked up. Like I said, you are your father, so like don't talk to me, like I'm some of the good ass parent. Shit. How many times... Watch your motherfucking mouth. Who you're cussing at? I'm cussing at nobody. I'm saying... How many times you lost a job? It doesn't matter. I'm still standing. - That's right. - Right. But how many times we had to move house to house and even then, it would even no fucking life. Can I tell you to watch your motherfucking tongue with me, boy. Didn't I fucking tell you, you don't... Get the fuck out of my house. So fucking disrespectful. Like I said, you are your father's son. - Guess, it happen to... - Get the fuck out. Hey, buddy. How are you going today? Okay. Are you from around here? No? All right. Well... This is a private park. So are you supposed to be here? Is that a no or a yes? Listen, man. I'm trying to talk to you, okay? Are you okay? All right, man, you're really starting to make me nervous because of not talking thing, okay? This is the park that my kids play in. All right. Well... Do I need to call the police? He can just go down the street. - There's a park right down the road. - Yeah, I just told him that. Come on, bud. Buddy, are you not listening to me right now? I said you need to leave. Get your ass up and get out of here. - Are you... - Say what? Just stop, right now. Okay? Just think about what you're doing right now. - Can you put that away, please? - I don't want any trouble, okay? All right. Well, just let you that you're not supposed to be here. Just... Hey, I need you to please stop, man. Stop right there. Take your hands out of your pocket. Son, you don't need to get hurt right here. Will you take your hands out of your pocket. Son, listen to me. I need you... Stop. Stop. - You don't need to get hurt right here. - Stop. Stop and drop to your knees. Take your hands out of your pocket and get down to your knees slowly. Cuff him. Keep your hands where I could see them. Put them on the top of your head. Interlock your hands. - I need to see my child. - I understand your frustration but... No, you can't because you're just sitting here telling me I can't see my child. I don't want to hear it. - I understand that. - Only if you're picking up the phone. Can I talk to him? Uhm, the direction is on the map. But like I said, you have to go to court. Only thing I can tell you, you go to court tomorrow at 9AM, - Court Room 3A, Judge Long will be the judge... - I can't go. I can't wait that long like-It's been about- They can't speak to him without the guardian. I'm just been calling-You already book him. - Is he hurt? Is he hurt? - - go on tomorrow to court. If you will go to court tomorrow, then you'll understand what's going on. - Is he hurt? Is he okay? - He's okay but he's not- You have to wait until tomorrow. I hear you, Mr Trombley. Your honor, the state would ask this court to hold this young man secure. He is currently on probation for breaking into cars and now we have a new felony offense, which the allegation is that he pulled a knife out on a young lady and her husband and Your Honor, that young lady is actually pregnant. Mr Johnson has been in front of this court before and now, he's back again. So the state would ask this court to hold him secure. He is a danger to our community. - Okay. Miss Fenlon? - Yes, Your Honor. We're-We're not disputing that this court of 12 gives you the authority to hold the young man but that, he is just at the cusp of that authority and he has a very limited history and has a very strong support system. I know his mother would very much like him to come home and that she would make sure he abided by any rules the court set. If you were to send him home on home detention with a monitor, she would make sure he followed those rules and she would alert the authorities if he were to violate it anyway. Your Honor, Christmas is coming up and this is just- the family would really like him to be home and I know she would like to be heard on this. Miss Williams? Yes, ma'am. Good morning, Judge. My son, I love my son, Your Honor and I ask that you please just send him home. I will obey whatever rules, you know, regulations you need me to. It has been a rocky year for him and... some things have been set on my behalf and I apologize to that, to you for that but Your Honor, if you can send him home, I will be there for him. - Mr Trombley? - Yes, Your Honor. You know, I understand, you know, the mother loves her son and the young man may have some issues but his behavior is now escalating and yes, I know Christmas is coming up but you know what? Christmas is also coming up for the victim's case as well. Mr Johnson, he chose this path and now, he should be held secured for it. - Anything from defense, Miss Fenlon? - No, Your Honor. Okay. Mr Johnson, Miss Williams, I agree with the state. Mr Johnson's criminal conduct is escalating. Originally, it was crimes against property. Now, we got crimes against people, so I don't think it's appropriate for the court to allow him to not be detained. I'm sorry about Christmas. What can I tell you? But it is what it is so I'm going to hold him secure for the 21 days. Man of clerk, what is that date? Arraignment should be on December 19th and trial would be December 28th. Okay. All right, then. What's the name of the attorney, please? Yes, what's the name of the juvenile? I am afraid that there is some possibility that they might consider what they call direct filing, your son and what that means is sending his case over to adult court. It doesn't necessarily mean, because the potential is up to five years, that anything like that would happen but that being said, we still don't want him to go to adult court so that's the biggest concern I have right now. Now, we have court again on the 29th. We can talk more about possible defenses whether Andrew wants to go to trial and I will be formally meeting with the state attorney's office to talk to them more about the case to see if they have an offer for him to consider and I know at this point, that's something you're not sure he should be doing... - Right. - But... It's something we want to, at least to have that option. If they decide to direct file, then that happens without- There's nothing we can do to stop that, so hopefully that won't be the case. So do you have now, a copy of the discharge, maybe? Yes, I can get you a copy of the police report. We can get that for you. Ry'nesia, we got to go. Come on. Let's go. We've never seen him around and we just asked him some questions and he just, you know, pulled the knife on us, so... I don't... It's kind of uncomfortable to talk about. Well, if I'm bothering you, you know, then I'll leave. Is it that my son is probably going to be direct filed in court system and tried as an adult but if you want to go leave, I leave. I don't want to, you know, bother you in any kind of way, shape, or form. I just wanted some kind of, I guess relief where I could sleep at night to find out what actually happened with my son. Your son was non-responsive and I don't think he should have had a knife at a park anyway but... I was just trying to keep my family safe and… But you didn't know he had a knife, like something had to happen for him to pull that knife and that's what I'm trying to figure out... what happened? I mean, I'm really sorry about what happened. I just-I don't really feel comfortable talking about it. Okay. Well, I just wanted to let you know that he would never hurt you, nor your kid or your husband. Get down. Didn't I just tell you to get down? They told me that my son went to a park to be approached by people to pull a knife on them. Now, your son went to a park where he was approached by people who mean him no harm. It was time he decided to pull the knife from people. So how did you decide they mean him no harm? Based on the testimony that he gave and based on the testimony - that they gave is the same. - Okay. When did you get his testimony what adult was there? What lawyer was there? By the time, he don't have to have an adult there... Yes, you're a child, you need a lawyer or an adult. By court-By state law, you don't have to have a parent... Or you should have a lawyer, that's my child. Now, it got to be up with the parent but I'm going to tell you right now. This is not the time and the place for us to sit here and have this discussion about this. It's never a right time to approach someone about the child, especially law enforcement. - This is not the time and place... - I want my child home... - Hello, Andrew? - Yes. Okay, I just wanted to go over what we spoke about earlier. We have been able to get an agreement that they will not direct file you if you go ahead and enter a plea to the high risk program. The program they're talking about is nine to 12 months long, generally speaking and when you get out of the program, you'd still be on supervision for some period of time. It's usually four to six months but that can go on all the way to your 21, if you don't do well in that original time period. Do you understand that part? - Yeah, I understand. - Okay. Is this still what you want to do? - Yes. - Okay. Mom, are-You see that- this is what Andrew wants to do? Do you want an agreement? Do you believe that it's in your best interest to enter a non-contest, please, Mr Johnson? - Yes. - Okay, I therefore, accept this plea and sentences follows. You'll be adjudicated delinquent. You'll be committed to a high risk facility. This shall be followed by conditional release. I will order a DNA to be taken and the predisposition report would be waived in this case. All cases, all counts shall run concurrent with one another. Now, you're committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice. - Anything further from the state? - No, Your Honor. - Anything from the defense. - Yes, Your Honor. Can we have a review date? Yes. Madam clerk? Yes, Your Honor. It's going to be January 11th... You'd be committed to DJJ. Good luck to you sir. All right... You all right? You sure you're all right because I need you to be okay. You now have a beautiful baby brother. There's going to one day look up to you. I hope you come home, son, so that you can love him, look out for him, and show him as much about as you show Ry'nesia. Your new brother reminds me so much of you and now the high hopes I have for you as a baby. But somehow over the years, all of those visions disappeared and were a place where anger... I'm sorry, son. Will you come home? I'm going to help you pick up the pieces and move forward. I have faith in you. Until you come home, you will always be missed. Love, Mom. I was going to send it to you but I... You know, some of that strength, I lose it. It means... You know, son, I just wanted... you just stay home. I mean whatever it takes, I'm here. If you need help with something, let me know. No need to get off of bed and build up and just explode. It's not good. It's not good. I love you, Mom. I love you too, baby. I want you to stay home, though, stay same. You need anything? Take your watch, shoes, place them... Your visit will come here shortly.
