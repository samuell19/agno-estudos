Mr. Bagheri called and said to go over now. -What does he want now? -He said to go over. No way It's not that - Hi My money is your money It's not much It's just 340 or 50 gold coins Tell me Yes Don't worry Your name won't be mentioned, yes Cash this Yes Don't worry No leave it to me My name is Navid it's the name my dead father chose It means good news something that brings joy I've been taught to stand on my own two feet and fight That's all I do, the circumstances, life, traitors I've principals I won't let people walk over I'm not afraid of anything I have to take what's mine and I will I'm 26 but I feel 260 There's no balance - He's a businessman Should I bounce it? No wait let me call There's no balance Should I bounce it or not? Cash it? It's empty, how? I know Mr Samavati but it's better if you call sir Yes Ok sure, bye Hamed what's Bagheri saying? He gave me a cheque to cash There's no balance He says to go over and make him pay What's he like I don't know what the money's for. It's not my problem He can do whatever he wants What's this? - Your cheque I'm not blind. I can see that You were supposed to cash it I said to- - Shut your hole Who are you to say? I tell you and you say yes You'll go over cash this and get back How else would I pay your wage? Hey! Take the cheque How dare you come to work when you're this clumsy Watch it - I'll talk to you the way you deserve, fool Why are you dragging this out? - What will you do? I'm not angry This isn't my job Who are you then? Look at me Who are you then? Pill popper, you think I don't know you're high on pills? Take this I'm not angry - What have your stupid parents taught you? Addict I'm not angry I'm not an angry person I don't want to be The doctor said to repeat this so I stay out of trouble But I can't. Sometimes it's necessary Especially when you have to stand up for yourself But the doctor says I can control myself I don't know why I couldn't just now It's like the first day I saw my doctor I'm confused, unsettled I feel like I'm behind I feel I feel miserable I want my life to go faster I'm ageing but nothing is changing What made you think to come here? I noticed the sign I had a feeling to come I don't know it just happened I think you could help When did it start to feel this way? How long has it been? A long time but I got worse the past 3-4 years I... Don't hold back tell me everything It might sound bad but sometimes I want to hit someone over the head I can't help it There are images in my mind And I see myself hitting someone Have you actually done it? Have you ever battered someone? No it's more no I don't mean it. It's a reaction in the moment Like I... I hate car horns The lights are red, why do you beep your horn? It's red It has to go green for you to drive Beeping your horn doesn't change anything, fool His wife is sitting there. He beeps his horn so it goes green quicker You have to batter him Someone who doesn't understand The horn isn't to annoy others I've realised some people need to be battered Enough beeping! Wouldn't you do it? Of course I had to hit the scumbag I'm in a group with my friends discussing politics One of my friends Defends a useless politician The politician isn't a relative of mine or his I get annoyed I get angry, when he chats shit about someone he doesn't know I want to strangle him, shut up Shut up Don't talk when you don't get it Pull his tongue out so he goes mute Press his head Why do you look at me like that? You think I'm crazy? I shouldn't have said. You think I'm crazy? I feel sorry for myself for these people You're not to determine who deserves to be hit You've citizenship rights If they're being ignored, hitting isn't the way to go Whenever you feel yourself getting angry Tell yourself you're not angry I'm not angry I'll give you pills to take 3 times a day to calm you down I took the pills as of that day They worked miracles and I felt better It relaxes me and I forget my problems I become someone else Nice, kind I see the world the way I want But I lied to the doctor about something It wasn't the sign Vahid told me to go see him, he'll help Vahid Tarantino is my housemate We've been friends for 3 years We live in our studio that's closed and become our house It's the pills It reserves energy Do you agree everyone is on something these days? Whoever says no is lying Stop Reza There's no perfect person I don't understand why you've let yourself go Use something like us Let yourself to be controlled It's fun. Stop Reza It relaxes you Not totally gone though what is this life Stop Reza Stop Reza I said to stop Vahid and I have another housemate too. Reza Bandar He moved from Bandar to Tehran to start a band with Vahid Stop Reza I said to stop Everyone has a band these days Like Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull No one could listen to their other tracks People who think they're so good at picking Don't realise this undermines humanity The legends have been and gone Beatles, Moody Blues and Rolling Stones in the 60s The progressive guys blew up the 70s Who can replace Yelpie, Genesis and Kim Crimson? They want to modernise music they don't know Planting a tree without roots on the moon isn't so cool Peter Gabriel might not be good at changing tyres But he makes good music We were born at a time that our good ideas sent us wandering They're mostly minstrels people are happy Nothing good will happen here We're polluted You have to keep playing cheesy to stay Then feel like heroes Then people say it's life they have to make money Shut your hole Art has discipline You have to know the roots then bend them Otherwise we wouldn't be the dossers They all have to respect me one day They think just because they're celebrities Their piss smells of Dior and our's stinks I'd never want to become that But I didn't sell myself out I'm still the best Still pure Who'd believe I'm 27? Who's responsible for the 8 years I lost? I couldn't work for 8 years 8 years God help us Song: A woman can't be your homeland Love songs are filthy The Kurdish poets among the mountains Mostly reach the same conclusion Loneliness is here the way it is Even darker and more bold I'm here as usual This is Ahmad he's a coward He wasn't always this way he became one After his brother's story He changed and became a different Ahmad He's still loyal It's your fault Who'd hit his boss? How could I ask for your money? Aren't you friends with his accountant? I asked for a favour - You could've hit him at the end of the month They've people everywhere You know what happens if he turns you in? - What have I done? Do you understand what you're doing? Your studies and now this I don't get why you feel sorry for people Which one of the ones you were expelled for Asked if you're dead or alive? Where are you? Where are you going? - I came here to feel better I hate your attitude I wasn't the top student at uni but my grades were always good It didn't go as planned My heart is still at uni That's Setareh The Setareh uni gave me As Dr. Shariati said Ali was the man who was a leader in Africa But he had no political prisons Even one political prisoner Excuse me sir! You've been quoting other people so far Why don't you say what you think? This is the trend now. Quoting big people to look big Why are we losing the confidence to express our own opinions? You're reading off the books We could've done that at home You just took the class time Have I? Who other than Shariati? Can anyone ignore Shariati? Is that what I said? Why do you put words in my mouth? - Do you have a problem with Shariati? I don't and I'm not disagreeing with you don't change my word You get what I'm saying We were supposed to discuss the idea To tell us what you think Not to quote others Tell us your opinion too so we can discuss it Isn't that using others' points to get to where you want? That's all Sorry The university's top student vandalising the lecturer's car Look he claims to be educated He binned the bottle too How would he clean it? How many books have you read by Shariati? Which one is the real you? How much? - What? The price for selling people out This? It's not for sale it's a memento What? - A memento What's your problem with me? I don't, I deleted it Let's see But don't make statements in class then vandalise cars Ok let's see if you've deleted it Let's see Vandalisation is better than filming people in secret Bye Hey That's my number, save it. Text me before 12 Look Cute. Let it eat Put him down, Navid Do you want to study at uni? So what's the end? Nothing We'll die and end there Some people never end Does Mosadegh ever end? Why do I get tears in my eyes when I think of Dr. Mosadegh and Dr. Fatemi? As long as there's history there's Mosadegh Or Ghandi This man doesn't end What about us? What about us? - Will we end too? For each other Will our love end too? Where were you? - Here with you Where's your mind wandering? With you Are you feeling down? - No Are you feeling low? - No Are you ok?
