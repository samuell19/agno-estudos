[film reel whirring] [dramatic music] [light music] [mysterious music] [rock music] [crowd cheering] [man and woman shouting muffled] - [Samantha] You're amazing. - That's sweet. - You know, I can't wait to get out of this town Eat deep dish pizzas in Chicago, and take selfies at the Grand Canyon. And since my 18th birthday sucked, I was thinking maybe we'd go to Vegas and completely blow it! What do you think? - About that... I don't think there's gonna be space on the tour bus. - What? I hate you! - You hate me? You barely know me. - You told me you loved me. - [Abe] Oh, come on! - You don't say it unless you mean it. - Well, I need some alone time. Can I get my shirt back? - I'm always alone, you son of a bitch! - Uh, keep the shirt. - You want this? - Wait, wait, wait. No, drop the guitar. - Beg me. - Please give me my guitar. Oh, I'm begging! - Shut up! [guitar cracking] - Oh! - Break a leg. [birds chirping] [knocking] Come on! - Not again. - Hurry up, lazy ass, before Hanson sees me. - I'm coming, relax. - Oh, come on! - You know it gets stuck. I'm trying. - Hey, did she ask about me? - I told her you went to bed after school 'cause you were sick. You're welcome. - Nice work, knick-knack. - Please don't call me that. - Fine, Danica. That's not even a real name. - You're literally the worst roommate ever, you know that? - You know you love me. [dramatic music] - The front door's open, you know? Come on. [sighing] [clears throat] I never should have agreed to let you stay until the end of the school year. You have broken rule after rule. I have given you more second chances than I can count, but your behavior has only gotten more erratic. Have you been taking your medications? - Just ground me or whatever so we can get on with this. - Pack up your things. You're 18 now, you've aged out of the system. By law, you should've moved out months ago. - Move where? - Look, I know how hard life has been for you, Samantha-- - Hard? I've been in 14 foster homes in 12 years. - I am well aware. You, you're not a victim, Samantha. It's not always someone else's fault, okay? At some point, you need to grow up, take responsibility for your part-- - And being homeless is somehow gonna miraculously turn me into a responsible human being? - You have choices, Samantha. However, living at Safe Harbor is no longer one of them. - I have nothing. Nobody. - You have your stipend to start out. - What is this? - That is enough! - You couldn't care less if I die out there! In fact, you'd probably even forget who I was tomorrow. You heartless bitch! - I said enough. Okay, this is precisely why you are no longer welcome here. [dramatic music] - You're scared of me. - Get out, now. Out, now! [pens clattering] Jesus... [water spraying] [people chattering] - That's the one. The-the Premium Transport LX. It's complete with a BPA-free snack tray, UV protective sun hood, and the world's most advanced stroller suspension for one smooth ride. - You sound like an infomercial. - I can't help that I'm excited. [gentle music] - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. - The treatments are gonna work this time, I know it. And once we have the world's greatest baby, we are gonna have the world's greatest stroller to go with it. - Okay. - Did I mention the state-of-the-art ventilation system? - All right, all right, enough about the stroller, silly. - We got this. Third time's the charm. - I believe you. All right, let's go get our great news. [Joseph sighing] - [Joseph] I'm gonna take my son fishing here. - Daughter. - Nah! Maybe it's gonna be one of each, you know? - [laughs] Okay, maybe. - Paternal instinct. - Unfortunately... The embryo has detached from the cervical wall, depriving it of the necessary nutrients it needs to develop-- - Just stop. - Joe... - So now what? - We can talk about another round. - The sooner, the better. - No. I'm sorry, honey. I can't go through it again. - No, I'm-I'm sorry. I um, I just really wanted this for us. - There are other options. Adoption. Fostering-- - I've got nothing against adoption, I'm all for it, it's just not how we pictured starting our family. - Of course. However, if you do change your minds, I can put you in touch with a private agency-- - That-that won't be necessary. Can we go? - [Joseph] Thank you for everything you've done. - Of course. [somber music] - She actually did it! - Did what? - Ms. Hanson, she kicked me out. - Sam, I'm so sorry. - I'm better than this place, no offense. - It could be worse. You could have just appreciated what we have. - Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say. You have a mom out there somewhere, you just choose not to look for her. - She abandoned me when I was a baby. Good parents don't do that. What if I wanted to find her and she didn't want me? You know what, screw that, you can't just make a family. - You know, God took six days to make the world and took a day to chill. [pills rattling] Maybe you're not trying hard enough. - Okay, Little Orphan Annie, where's your Daddy Warbucks? - You know, I forgot to tell you that Ms. Hanson wanted to see you too. - Me? - Yeah. You were my accomplice, after all. - But, but... You made me! - I wouldn't worry. You're her favorite. [ominous music] - Okay. [birds chirping] - Hey. - I uh, I was thinking we could turn this room into an office. Then I wouldn't have to stay late at the restaurant and you can get the study all to yourself. Or we could turn it into a gym? I could finally get those six-pack abs I've always wanted. [sighing] This isn't what I thought my belly would look like over the next nine months. - I wanna show you something. - Danica? - I had Ivan do something. You know, he's kind of a computer nerd. - Yeah, Melissa says the same thing. But how-how do you know that's her? And there's no pictures of her. Why? - Maybe she's not a selfie addict like the rest of America. But, look, she's the same age, she's from your hometown, she has your maiden name. - Tyrell... That is so weird. Why didn't the Martins change her name after they adopted her? - Well, that's the thing. As far as Ivan can tell, they didn't. - What? - Yeah, she never got adopted. She's been living in a foster home her whole life. Look, we don't know what her life's been like. And we can't assume the worst. - Now you want me to reach out to her after she grew up like that? - I do, but it's your decision to make and I will support whatever you choose. - This could be a disaster. - It could, but it could also be an incredible gift. [gentle music] [birds chirping] - Still making up your mind? - Oh uh... Yeah, let's go with white linens for the tablecloths. Classic, clean. - I meant about sending the message. - I think I'm on draft eight. Would you want your mother, who gave you up when you were a baby to reach out after all these years? - Uh, I don't know. I might be a little mad, but, I'd wanna know where I came from. Who my real mom was, especially if my real mom was as cool as you. - What do I even say to her? - Just be yourself. And do not open with a joke, 'cause you are not that funny. - Not helpful. [Melissa chuckling] - She's gonna wanna meet you. I know it. Who wouldn't want you for their real mom? - Thanks. - You're amazing. Love you. - Love you. Here goes... [sighing] [dramatic music] [electronic beeping] - What do we have here? "Hello, Danica. "I'm your mother." [chuckling] Could this get any more perfect? Thanks Kate, I needed a new place to stay. Sorry, knick-knack. Finders keepers! "Can't believe you actually found me. "I've waited my whole life for this moment. "Where have you been?" - I can't believe you found me. "I've waited my whole life for this moment. "I had actually given up, "but maybe fate has intervened "because I'll be headed your way tomorrow. "So if you're around tomorrow, "I'm gonna be in town and I'd like to see you." From Danica. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow! - This is really happening. [sighing] - Yeah, this is really happening! Wait, oh wait, no, tomorrow I have meetings at the restaurant all day. I'm gonna have to reschedule! - You-you open in less than a week. Just have her meet you at the restaurant. Hey, it'll be fine. It'll be better than fine. - You're right. I can do this. "I'll be at my restaurant all day tomorrow. "Stop by when you're in town. "I can't wait to meet you." [electronic beeping] - I'm in! Kettle... Black... Bistro. Delete. And delete. Okay. - Sam? Sam! Sam! I know you have my laptop, I just want it back. Sam? Sam? - Knick-knack... [dramatic music] You see, I really need that laptop now. I've kind of become attached to it. I think you can understand. Just think about it as a parting gift. Things are finally looking up for me. Sleep tight, knick-knack! [foreboding music] [birds chirping] Showtime. Hello? Hi, I'm looking for Kate Whitman, my name's-- - Danica! Yeah, hi! O-M-G, hi! Okay, just follow me. You look amazing! She's gonna be so excited to see you. You kind of look like her, sort of, I don't know. You have a visitor. - Danica... - Is this a bad time? - No! No, come in, please. [mysterious music] - Okay. - Wow... Look at you! I've imagined this moment a million times... - Me too. [choking sob] [ominous music] [birds chirping] - [Kate] So that's what I called it. [Kate chuckling] - Kettle Black Bistro. - Yep, Black Bistro. - I like it. - Yeah I've wanted to own my own restaurant since I was a kid, and it's all happening. Well, that's if it passes the inspection tomorrow. [upbeat music] - I'm sorry, this is so surreal. You're everything I imagined. You're beautiful, you're so successful. [chuckling] And you're kind of awesome. - You're kind of awesome yourself. - Must be genetic. [both chuckling] - Danica, I am so sorry. Giving you up for adoption was the hardest decision of my life. I thought you were going to a loving home. I... I saw you leave the hospital with them. - I was, until they found out I had a heart condition. They had a little bit of buyer's remorse. - A heart condition? Is that still an issue? - No, no, I'm fine. Couple of surgeries, a few band-aids. Um, I don't even have a scar though. - You were never adopted then? What, who? - Foster homes, group homes. Safe Harbor now. I don't, I don't really like to talk about it. - Of course, I... I would really love it if you would join my husband and I for dinner tonight. - Really? - I insist. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, I mean yes! I would love that! - Okay! Joseph is cooking, so, I'm hoping it will be edible. I hope. [both laughing] Hey! - Hey, Kate, I'm so sorry. But there's a whole leak underneath the refrigerator. It's really bad. - Of course there is. I-I'll be right there, I'm coming. Uh... Danica, I'm so sorry, but I have to go take care of that. - That's fine. - But uh, if you could give your email address to Melissa, and she'll send you my address? - Mmhmm. - Okay? I'll see you tonight. - You will. - Looking forward to it. [soft blues music] He was my first kiss, and my first dance, and my first, well... Here you are. [chuckling] - Hooray, me! - His uh, family was very religious, so they moved him, your father away, and that was that. I was 16 and I was the oldest of five kids, so my parents were not in any position to take on another child, but I don't blame his family, not at all. But, we were very much in love. - You know, I'm gonna let you ladies uh, finish catching up. I'm gonna turn on the game. - Mm-nmm, I said were in love, past tense. You know you're my one and only. - Well, if you put it that way, I'll stay. But I'm gonna change the subject. - Okay. - Kate tells me that you're in a group home now. Is-is that better? - Um, not so much. It's one of the bad ones, so I ran away. - You ran away? - Yeah a few months ago, the head lady, a Mrs. Hanson, she likes to punish us for no reasons. And the punishments are pretty bad, so, I'm shelter-hopping now. - Shelter-hopping? - It's fine, like, I get by one way or another. - Do you like chocolate chip ice cream? All right honey, let's get some! We'll be right back. - Chocolate chip. - All right. Love chocolate chip. I think we're gonna need the room after all. - You want her to-to move in? We've only known her for 24 hours. - She's my daughter, Joseph. - Yeah I know, and I feel for her, I do, but technically, she's still a stranger. - Yeah, she's a stranger, and it's my fault. - Okay, um... Look, I'm on your side. - You of all people should be supportive. You started this. Brought her to me. What are we supposed to do, send her back to that awful place where she, quote, "Escaped from"? - No, no, uh... Look... You're right, okay? Kate, you-you're right. I just, um... - Just what? - I... Am an idiot, and I am a big stupid-head, and I'm sorry, and, can we please just kiss and make up and go back to being the world's most perfect couple? - Once we get the adoption going, perfect family. - Perfect family. [ominous music] [knocking] - Well, you're a rarely welcome sight. - I have a delivery for you. - Can I go now? - Sure. - Thank you. - What did she do? - That one, nothing. Poor thing was found locked in the closet at the library. - I'm sorry, what? - Says she was forced in by one of your other girls, I think her name was-- - Samantha. Samantha Brown. - Yeah, that's right. That's the one. Says she stole her laptop too. Maybe you should have a talk with her? - Um, Samantha is no longer with us. I had to let her go due to, well, many factors. - Oh. Was there anything else I should be made aware of? - No. No. - Okay. Thank you for your time, ma'am. You have a good night. - Thanks. - Uh, your bathroom is just across the hall from your room. Um, I'll show you how to use the shower. It can get a little bit tricky. - Where was this at? - I don't suppose you did much camping when you were a kid? - No, I was never with one family long enough. Is this yours? - It's been in Joseph's family forever. Uh, with the restaurant, it's just been really hard to get away. - You guys look really happy. - It's kinda hard not to be. The whole world melts away when we're there. [dramatic music] It helps us to just reconnect when life pulls us apart, which it can do from time to time. - I'd really like to go there. - Sure. Maybe once the restaurant opens, we can take you there and you can see what I mean. - I'd like that. - You wanna see your room? - Mm-hmm. - This way, right down there. Here we are. - It's lovely. - Liar! [chuckling] Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Tomorrow, we are gonna go for some retail therapy. I can get away for a few hours and we can get some things of your own. I just really want this place to feel like home for you. Oh, and I'll need the information for the foster home. I wanna let them know that you're here. - Of course, I'm sure I have the number somewhere. - No rush. Get it to me in the morning. I just wanna make sure I have your paperwork. Uh, I have some phone calls and meetings tomorrow, but I'll probably have a window at about four. - You don't have to. - I want to! I'll call you at four when the inspector leaves and I'll let you know when you can come by. - Awesome. - Okay, well, I'll uh, let you get settled in. - Uh, Kate? - Yeah? - I just wanted to say thank you. For everything. - It's my pleasure. Welcome home, Danica. [ominous music] [knocking] - Come in. - Hi, how are you, dear? - All right. - I have something for you. Consider it compensation for your willingness to tolerate what must've been a very difficult living arrangement. - You got me a present? - You're a good girl, and you deserve so much better. I regret not having stepped in earlier. - Ms. Hanson? Thank you. - Yeah. [gasping] [foreboding music] [pills rattling] Samantha, what are you doing? [cell phone buzzing] - This is her, just like we practiced, okay? - You got the money? - Yes, just make it super simple and really quick. Okay, answer it! - I want 20 more, on accounting for inflation and all. - Are you serious? She's gonna hang up. - You want me to do this or not? - Okay, yes, I'll give you the extra 20 afterwards, just answer the phone! [Samantha sighing] - Safe Harbor, this is Ms. Hanson. - Hi, this is Kate Whitman. I'm calling in regards to Danica Tyrell? - Yeah, what about her? - [Kate] Well, I'm her biological mother. - Congratulations. - Excuse me? - Look, I'm uh, swamped with paperwork, so uh, can we make this quick? - Oh uh, yes, of course. I gave her up for adoption at birth, but just found out she's been in foster care all this time. - And now you want custody? - Yes, actually, of Danica Tyrell. How would I go about doing that? - Uh... Forms, yeah, yeah, you'll have to, you'll need to fill out a few forms. You want me to uh, mail 'em to you? - That's all I need to do? - Yes. Oh, well, not entirely. Uh, there'll be instructions in the envelope I send you on how to proceed. - Oh, uh yes, of course, thank you. - Will that be all, ma'am? - Yeah, well, if that's all I need to do, yes. You can send that over to uh, Kate Whitman, at Kettle Black Bistro, 419 West Commonwealth Ave. - Hold on, let me grab a pen. Would you repeat that, please? - 419 West Commonwealth Ave. - Yeah, got it. Okay, uh, you have a nice day now, ma'am. - Thank you. [sighing] - Could you have maybe sound a little more official, like you had an idea what you were doing? - Excuse me? Do I look like a professional actor to you? [phone cracking] Hey, where's my money? - Do I look like a welfare agent to you? - Come back here! Hey, you! - She hates me. - I think she hates everyone. - I think so too, look at her walking really slow. - She's like a spider. - Investigating. Ready to pounce. - Well, everything looks good so far. I'll be expecting an invitation to the grand opening, of course. - Done, thank you. Thank you, thank you! - Joseph! [birds chirping] Joseph, you home? Joseph? [foreboding music] [phone beeping] [dial tone ringing] - [Kate] Hi, this is Kate Whitman, please leave a message! [phone beeping] [dial tone ringing] Hi, this is Kate Whitman, please leave a message! - I just need to take a quick gander at the floor sink. - Absolutely, it's just uh, right back that way. [foreboding music] [phone beeping] - Did she just say gander? - That's like, the most offensive thing you could ever say to me. - I didn't know people still said that. - It's like we traveled back to the 1940s. [phone ringing] - Back in time. Oh Melissa, can you uh-- - Okay, got it, got it. Kettle Black, this is Melissa. - Melissa, uh, it's Danica, is Kate there? - Oh, she's been crazy all day with contractors and vendors, it's, sorry. - Well, she said that she'd call me at four. We have plans. - [Melissa] Can I have her call you back a little bit later? - Will you actually tell her that I called? - Of course Danica, but like I said, she's been really, really busy, and she can't call you back 'til later. - But-but she said that she would! - I don't know what to tell you. - [Kate] Melissa? Can you bring me the contact info for the liquor distributor? - Yeah, I'll be right there. Okay, so I'll have her call you back later today, okay? I promise. - No, I need to talk to Kate right now! [phone beeping] [ominous music] - Hey, when did you get back? - I just got here. - Oh good, I could use an extra set of hands. Do you mind holding this down there? - What happened? - Those damn raccoons again. They are determined to ruin Melissa and Kate's handiwork. - Melissa's handiwork? - Yeah, this is kind of their pet project. See that creepy scarecrow? That's all Melissa. - Definitely creepy. - Aren't you supposed to be shopping with uh, Kate? - I was. - Still at the Kettle huh? Don't take it personally, she's, she's just really busy right now. - It's fine, whatever. - I'm gonna go watch TV. [upbeat music] - [Narrator] Of a US spy plane after receiving a letter saying the US was very sorry-- [doorknob rattling] [dramatic music] - Honey, I'm sorry about today. The inspector was late, and that threw off the whole day and-- - You promised that we'd go for some retail therapy. Don't say things if you don't mean them. - I know, and I was-- - No, it's fine. You and Melissa had more important things to do, I get it. God forbid you spend a few hours with your daughter that you haven't seen since, I don't know, since birth? [news reporter speaking quietly] I'm tired, I'll go to bed early. [sighing] - [Kate] Joe? - Mm-hmm? - Did we make a mistake? I mean, with Danica, letting her move in so soon? - Why, what do you mean? - I'm not sure, but, I don't know. She kind of exploded when I came home from work. - What do you mean, exploded? - Admittedly, I messed up. But... I don't know. Honestly... It scared me. - You know, she was acting a little weird with me earlier today too, but I-I think we should just chalk it up to a bad day. I mean, she's been through hell. We gotta admit that this whole process is not gonna be rainbows and unicorns. We gotta give her time. - You're right. She's dealing with a lot. What would I do without you? Okay, all right, all right, all right, oh! [gasping] [ominous music] You scared me. I didn't see you there. What? Is, is everything okay? - I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean the things that I said. I just really wanted to spend time with you. And I'm really scared of losing you again. - Oh honey no, that is not something you need to be worrying about. I am here. Look, tell me, what can I do to help you feel more secure? - Well... You know how you said the cabin is the place where you, you and Joseph can bond? - Yeah. - I was thinking maybe we could go there? Just for even a night? For some mother-daughter bonding so we can be like a real family? I think it would help, a lot. And I really need it. I feel like your daughter. I want you to feel like you're my mom. I want to stay here forever. Am I asking you too much? - No, not at all. In fact, I am gonna make this work. I will talk to Melissa at the restaurant. What's one night? Thank you for being honest. Now, I gotta go, or Mellie is gonna have my head on a platter, no pun intended. I'll see you later, bye. What about the uh, puce? That's, that's gone right? - The puce? It's dead, so dead. As is that weird mustard-green color. - Ew. - Okay, we need to talk about the fact that our designer, what is her deal? - Yeah. I mean she's really sweet, but I think she might be blind. - I know, or colorblind at least. - [Kate] At least. I really liked her though. You know what? - She's nice. - I don't know what I would do without you. You are like an angel sent down from heaven. - Seriously? - Yes, you're the best. I love you so much. - Hey! - Hey... - Hey, Danica. What is this? - [Samantha] Open it. [Melissa chuckling] - This is awesome. [Kate gasping] - It's not much, but I just wanted to thank you and Joseph for everything you're doing. - I love it! Thank you! - Danica, it is seriously so beautiful. - Look at that! - It's gorgeous, really. Put it on. Try it on right now. - Well, okay. [foreboding music] I think it's a little bit tight. You know what? I can just adjust the length. I love it. - Sorry, I should have checked first. I'm so stupid. - No. Honey, you are not stupid. It's perfect. Here, since you're here, you can help us finalize the menu. Okay, what do you think? - Okay. - These are our options. Danica? - I don't know actually. Uh, I... I was thinking we could go to the cabin this weekend? - You're going to the cabin, seriously? Danica, you're gonna love it. It's my favorite place in the world. - Wait, you've been there? - [Melissa] Yeah. - Oh, yeah, well after the hassle with the budget and everything, we just needed a break. So we took a girl's trip up there. - And thank God we did, we needed it so bad. We watched like, Dirty Dancing like what, 100 times? - At least 100 times, and I think I cried every time! [Kate laughing] Oh but, I was hoping to have a barbecue on Saturday to introduce you to the neighborhood. - We could go after? Stay until Sunday? - Uh... Um, cell reception up there is really, really spotty, and something's gonna come up with Kettle Black, I'm sure. - You know what, you're right. It might not be the best idea. - I'm sure Melissa can take care of the restaurant. I mean, it's only for one night. Come on, please? You need some peace and quiet. - I don't know... One night won't hurt. I will talk to Joseph tonight. But first, back to the menus. [phone ringing] - Oh uh, I'll get it. - Okay. What do you think? Which one do you like best, hmm? - Um... I don't know. - Kettle Black. - Okay. - It's too hard. - [Kate] Okay, but what do you think about what's... [foreboding music] - No, I definitely agree with you, that is so important. Um, I'm gonna write that down. Just um, just gonna need a pen. Okay, one minute. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I'm-I'm with you still. I'm just gonna grab a pen, yeah. - Mellie, where's that necklace on my desk, the one Danica gave me? Did you happen to see it? - [Melissa] I haven't, but I will help you look for it. - It's okay sweetie, it'll be here. - Wait a minute... Is this it? [foreboding music] - Melissa? - Oh my God. I have no idea how it got there, Kate, I swear. - Well, it's just strange, that's all. - Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean? - Why are you attacking me? - Attacking you? I'm not attacking-- - Well, what's my gift doing in your purse? - Okay, okay, both of you, just stop it! - Kate, you know I would never do anything like that. Not ever. - Well, I'm sure it just got mixed up with your things and accidentally scooped into your purse. Let it go, really. It was an accident, okay? - Yeah. - Okay? Danica, let's go home. Mellie, let it go. Okay, I trust you. - Sure. - Oh. Okay. - Hey, Kate. - Oh hey! - Hey. - I know what you're gonna say. She told you. - Yeah, she did. - It's done and over. It was an honest mistake. - Cool, just, just checkin'. - Okay. Hey uh, Danica, this is Ivan, Melissa's boyfriend. He lives in the house right behind us. - Hi. - Hi. - Uh, thank you, by the way. - Yeah, no problem. You were uh, you were a tough one to track down. - What do you mean? - Ivan is the one who found you. - Oh. Really? - Yeah, yeah. - Hey uh, we're having a barbecue tomorrow, if you wanna come? Are your parents gonna be back in town? - Oh no, they won't be back 'til later, but-- - Oh, that's too bad. Next time. - But I'll, I'll be there. - Okay, cool. - Yeah. - Kate's gonna teach me to make her famous roasted duck. - Yeah, well, I gotta pass it down to the next generation. It's gonna be a Kettle Black signature dish. Put it on the map. - That sounds like a blast of a night. - You've had my duck before-- - It's amazing. - Yeah. - You're gonna love it. - I know. - On the map, all right. - Yeah! - Well, I'll let you guys get to it. But uh, have a good night, and welcome to the neighborhood, Danica. - Bye Ivan, good night! - All right. Have a good night. - See ya! Watch your head. Boo, what are you doing? [crowd applauding] - Why? - You're horrible. Why are they clapping? Let's boo! - You should beat any of these guys. - Honestly, hey! - No, you stop, you're stealing all of it! - I am not! Okay, okay, seriously, it's all over with. - You're so addicted to this. - Do not judge me. You're gonna become addicted to dating reality shows, like me. What? No, boo! I can't believe you chose her! - What? Oh my God, they're never gonna last. - I can't believe they picked her! That makes no sense! Ugh! [doorbell ringing] - I'll get it. - All right, you're gonna miss all the good stuff. - Do not eat all the popcorn. - I might. This guy! Oh, you know what? You're too good for him, girl. - What do you want? - Uh, is Kate home? - Uh, we're busy. - I brought her these. - What is it? - Danica, did I upset you or-- - [Kate] Mellie? - I brought you these. - Oh, you didn't have to do that. - I wanted you to have them for our garden. - I'm gonna go watch our show. - Okay, honey. Oh. - I just felt so bad about the whole necklace situation-- - Are you kidding? Forget it, it was a misunderstanding, end of story. [chuckling] - Um, should I apologize to her? I feel like I should, should I-- - Just sleep on it. - Okay. - All right, I'm just gonna go back to watching TV. - Okay. - Thank you, I love you. - I love you too. - Drive safe. - [Melissa] I will, Kate. - Bye! Danica, I'm coming! [bottles rattling] [foreboding music] [knife scraping] [plants rustling] - What the hell? What? Oh my God. [breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [electronic beeping] - Melissa Reed? "Hi Danica, I'm sorry about what happened." Uh... Sorry, Melissa whoever you are. Wrong Danica. A message from someone I actually know would be nice. - Morning. - [Kate] Good morning! - [Joseph] Hey, morning. - [Samantha] What's for breakfast? - Well, I hope you like pancakes and eggs. - Of course I do. I'm a human being on the planet Earth. - Good, because um, I was thinking that after breakfast, we could plant Melissa's flowers, and maybe expand the garden by a few feet? - Uh, and you want to do all that before the barbecue? - Well, I already packed up the car, while you lazybones were having your beauty sleep. [chuckling] Well, hurry up and eat. We don't have a lot of time. [doorbell ringing] - Oh, I'll get it. - Okay. - This looks great. - Oh, it does. Okay... - I don't have any messages. [sighing] Okay, I am officially a loser. Looks like you're my only friend today, Melissa Reed. I guess I'll learn a little bit more about you. Oh, we're practically neighbors. [dramatic music] - [Ivan] Hey, can we, can we talk for a sec? - What do you want? - I saw you last night. - What are you talking about? - In the garden. - Look, I can explain. - I'm listening. - Just don't tell anybody, please. I'm begging you. - [Kate] Oh my God! Joseph, come here! - What was that? - I gotta go. - Is everything okay? - [Samantha] Yes, everything's fine. Please-- - Was that Kate? - [Samantha] No, it's fine, go! - It's ruined, I can't believe this! - What happened? - It's destroyed. - I'm so sorry. - Can't believe the raccoons could cause this much damage. - Well, Mellie's gonna be devastated. - Poor Mellie. - Well... It's ruined, we're gonna have to cancel the barbecue. - No. No, the barbecue must go on, with or without the garden. It's gonna be perfect. I promise. [foreboding music] [upbeat music] [people chattering] - Oh! - You know, we're feeding our friends, not the entire state of California? - I know, I know, I overdid it. - [Joseph] As usual. - I wanted Danica's introduction to the neighborhood to be memorable. - It's perfect. - Almost. - Hey, do not look at the garden. Let's just stay focused right here. - You're right. I think she's having fun. - Absolutely. And we are out of table space. I haven't even started setting up for the burgers yet. - I was hoping you wouldn't notice. - I'm gonna run and get another table out of the garage. - [Kate] Yeah, you do that, you slacker! - Hey! [Kate laughing] - [Melissa] Hey, Kate. - Hey! - Everything looks amazing. - Yeah, almost amazing. - It's fine. I'm okay, I mean, it sucks, but it'll be fine. It's-- - You need a cocktail. - Yes. Yes, I do. - Yes you do. - Can you get me a cocktail? - You got it. - Okay, thank you. - Coming right up. - You know me, girl. [Melissa sighing] - [Ivan] Hey, babe. - Hey, honey. - Do you have a second? - [Melissa] Sure, why? - It's probably better if we just talk over at my place. - Is everything okay? - [Ivan] Yeah. - Okay. [foreboding music] See, I told you there was something wrong with her. - Yeah, you think? - We need to tell Kate. - Oh come on, you don't want to at least talk to Danica first? - Are you kidding me? - Look, look, I don't know. I mean, she's clearly jealous. I know her life probably hasn't been that easy. - Yeah, but she doesn't have to be all psycho about it. God, I can't believe I actually apologized to her. - Wait, what? When? - Well, I... I messaged her. I was so nice to her. God, I'm such an idiot. God, and that brat never responded, of course. I need you to send me that video. - Melissa-- - Ivan... - Look, look, okay, just don't send it to anyone 'til we can at least talk to her. - I can't promise you that. Kate's my best friend. - So let's just hear what she has to say. Okay? - Fine. - Let's get back to the party. - Okay. Danica? Do you have a problem with me? - Why do you care? - I just want to know what I did. Are you jealous? - Of you? - Our relationship, Kate and me. - Don't flatter yourself. I'm her daughter, her blood. - And why would you do it? Why would you destroy our garden, Danica? I mean, do you need to be on medication or something? - Okay, what did you just say? - Danica, seriously, we're just trying to talk. - See, this is what happens. Every single time I mention her name, you get so weird. - Do not call me weird! - Stop, just stop, okay? [foreboding music] You owe me an explanation, remember? It's all right here. All of it. - Congratulations on a job well done, guys. I have to say, I think that was a huge success, even though it happened in a war zone. [Samantha chuckling] - I don't think anybody noticed. - [Joseph] Yeah, what war zone? - [Kate] Aw, you guys are sweet. And so full of it, by the way. - Well, I'm, wait, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm-I'm full of it? - No, no, no, no, no! This is the new dress I got for the party! - The party's over now so-- - Uh, hey guys? I think I'm gonna take a walk and clear my head. - Oh, that sounds nice. Uh l-let me get my sweats on-- - Oh no, it's, it's okay. I grew up in a house with kids 24/7, and I kind of like my alone time. It's therapeutic. - Oh, yeah, of course, do whatever you need to, sweetie. - Thanks. I'll be back soon then. - Okay. Well uh, you know what that means? - What does that mean? - I get to go to yoga. - Ah, ooh! I got your yoga moves right here. - Uh, no, no, no, no. You do not want to be in the car with me for an hour if I don't get to go to my yoga class. I'll be back soon. [Joseph sighing] - Namaste. [knocking] - [Ivan] What's up? - You wanted to talk? Let's talk. - Yeah, come in. - [Samantha] Where are your parents? - [Ivan] They'll be home in an hour or two, depending on traffic, why? - [Samantha] Just wondering. - The room's right over there. [door creaking] You gonna explain what happened in the garden? - I'm sorry. - Okay. Anything else? - I'm truly sorry. I just... Um... [sighing] [foreboding music] You know, I thought after all these years if I found my mom that it would fix me. But life doesn't work that way. - No, sometimes it doesn't. - And I can't even remember doing all that stuff to the garden. And Melissa is wonderful. It had nothing to do with her, I swear. It's just... Sometimes I feel like I'm disappearing. Like... My body and my soul is just gonna fade away, and the only way to stop it is to destroy things. It's the only way that I feel like I'm still here. [sniffs] I know, it's crazy. - No. It's not. It's unbelievably honest. I'm sorry, I wasn't really expecting that. - I know, it's a lot. - Look, I don't want to be a snitch, okay? And honestly, I've never seen Kate happier. It wouldn't be fair to her. Look, I will erase that video, okay? - Thank you. - But you have to tell Kate exactly what you told me just now, okay? [sniffs] - Okay. - You do that, you let me know, assuming you're gonna be as honest with me as you are right now. - I will. - And it's like that video never existed. It's gone. She's your mother, Danica, without condition. She wants to help you. She wants to make you happy, more than anything. Let her. - Okay. - Let's get you home. - Okay. [door creaking] [ominous music] [Ivan groaning] Thanks for the therapy session, Ivan. Good night. Next time, watch your step. [birds cawing] Hey. - Hey, you're back, how was the walk? - Amazing, actually. I feel like a completely different person. Where's Kate? - Yoga. Yeah, I think it's probably the one thing she loves more than me. - [Samantha] Oh, stop it. - I'm kinda serious. [chuckling] - What are you doing? - Uh, right now, I'm just working on emails. - Is that from Melissa? - Uh yeah, it is. It's, I don't know, it's probably like some strange video, like a crazy monkey riding backwards on a pig or something like that, I don't know. You wanna watch it? - Wait! Why don't we watch it on the big screen? - Uh, well that's a little bit above my pay grade, I don't-- - No here, I can handle this, and you take care of the TV. - All right, big screen it is. [Joseph groaning] - Ugh. That was probably overkill. [phone beeping] [chuckling] Thank God for autosave. [foreboding music] Of course. Not this time. - Okay. Well, that's just weird. I definitely need a vacation. - Joseph? [Joseph groaning] Hey, it's Danica. - What happened? - You tripped on the rug and you hit your head. You're bleeding really bad. - I'm, I'm fine. - No you're not, we need to go to the hospital. - I'm okay, I just need to-- - You just stay, no, just stay here. - I just need some water. - You need to go to the hospital. - Come on Ivan, pick up. Where are you, sweetie? You always answer for me... [electronic beeping] [sighing] God, what do you want? Now you want to accept my apology. - [Danica Voiceover] Melissa, this is Danica Tyrell. I got your message about some necklace, and I have no idea what you're talking about. I saw a picture of you with a woman named Kate Whitman. Next to her is a girl identified as me, Danica Tyrell. But she's definitely not me. - Oh my God. - Her name is Samantha Brown. She's been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and is wanted by the police for aggravated assault. She's trying to replace me. - Excuse me. Danica? Where is he? - He's in there. - Hey, what are you doing? Get back in bed. - The doctor said I'm fine. There's no concussion, just-just a few stitches. [pills rattling] These babies, and I'm good to go. A little R and R, and I will be as good as new. - Oh no, I'm sorry, but the cabin is off for tonight. - But what do you mean? - Hey, come on. She, she said I needed to rest, but she didn't specify where. - Yeah, you can't argue with that. Please, Kate? Pretty please? - Yeah, come on, I can rest just as easily at the cabin as I can here. It'd be better, actually. There's no cell reception out there, so I will have no choice but to rest. - Okay, fine. But for real, you are gonna rest the entire time. - Deal. [Kate chuckling] - Hey, you... [Kate sighing] Hey, hey, get away! - Go get cozy in bed. - All right, don't have to twist my arm. I am gonna take the world's longest nap. [Samantha laughing] - He's okay. - Accidents like today make me think about all the what ifs? - Like what if he didn't find me? [foreboding music] - True. And what I wouldn't do without my Joseph. [people chattering] [sirens wailing] - No, wait, no please, no! No! Oh God! No, Ivan, please! - Ma'am, you can't get back here. You can't get back here, just-- - No, no, let me go! She murdered him! She murdered him! She murdered him! - I need you to relax-- - The little bitch killed him! - Relax ma'am, I need you to relax now! Ma'am, you're under arrest! - No, no, listen to me! Listen to me! She murdered him! [Melissa sobbing] You don't understand-- - [Officer] You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you-- - This place is really pretty. - I'm glad you like it. Danica, I am so sorry. I've been so focused on opening up my business that we haven't even had any quality time. - It's okay-- - No, it's not okay. I want you to know how much you mean to me. - I do. You have given me... This family and this home. Nobody's ever done that for me before. I was nothing. I was nobody. And now, I'm your daughter. And... This is the most amazing feeling in the entire world. - Thank you for saying that. - I-I love you. And I will never let you go. [foreboding music] [Samantha sighing] [birds calling] - Look at this, she stole my identity. What's up with that? - I wish I was more shocked, to be honest with you, but that girl is capable of anything. - Who are these people? What is she doing to me? I was nothing but a good friend to her. [dramatic music] - Uh... The woman on the right, her name is Kate? - Um, apparently. Why? - Hold on a second. - Okay, we got hot dogs, hamburgers, buns, sodas, eggs, milk, potato chips, orange juice, bacon. I think that's it. - What about s'mores? - [Kate] S'mores, huh? - I've never had 'em before. - You have never had s'mores? [scoffs] Well, that is unacceptable. S'mores it is. - [Joseph] Ice cream sandwiches! - [Kate] Okay, honey. [Kate laughing] - I was thinking maybe we could go fishing before we leave? I've never done it before and I have this really long list of things I've never done. - You have never gone fishing either? Well, it's been years since I've looked at the fishing equipment, but I don't see why not. Okay, well the town isn't too far, I should be back in less than an hour. - Awesome. - Bye! - [Samantha] Bye. [door slamming] - [Detective] Morning. Feeling better? - All night, really? It was an accident. - [Detective] It's for your own good, trust me. - Fine. Just let me try to explain this, okay? Um, my best friend, Kate Whitman and her husband are with a lunatic right now, Ms. Danica, uh, what's um... It's S-Samantha. Samantha Brown. - Is it Danica or Samantha? - It's complicated. Anyway, uh, she somehow convinced my best friend that she's her daughter. It's uh, her name is Danica Tyrell. That's her real daughter's name. Look, they're on their way to the cabin, so you need to go do-- - Well, there's no actual evidence of foul play. And what we have is a body at the bottom of a staircase with a broken neck. - Can I have my cell phone back, please? - Technically, you assaulted a police officer, ma'am. I'm not gonna press any charges, but you need to cool down a bit. But you'll get it back. - Clearly you think I'm insane. - I'm a detective, not a psychiatrist, but I'd imagine you're in shock. - Yes, I'm in shock, obviously I'm in shock! But I'm not insane... I'm not, I'm not insane. Look at me. You need to send someone up there, right now. Or there's a very good chance that someone else is gonna turn up dead. And when that happens, I'm gonna say, "I tried to warn him, your honor. "But he just wouldn't listen." [dramatic piano music] - [Ms. Hanson] Does she look familiar to you? - Is that my mother? - It is. - Oh God, I have to warn her! Kate Whitman, where are you? [foreboding music] - Hello, miss. I'm looking for a Kate or Joseph Whitman? - Uh, Kate went to the store, and Joseph's napping right now. Is there anything I can help you with? - I just got a request from County to drop by and make sure there's no funny business going on. It's just uh, routine, really. Hey um, your name wouldn't happen to be Samantha Brown, would it? - No. Uh, I've always liked the name Samantha. I'm Danica. - A pleasure. - Danica Whitman. - Oh, I see. Uh, you wouldn't happen to have ID on ya? - I do, but it's inside. I can grab it? - Sure. - Would you like to come inside and get a drink or something? - I'd appreciate that. [receiver beeping] Oh. - [Dispatcher] Officer Raymond, have you reached the cabin yet? Please respond. - [Officer Raymond] Yes dispatch, I'm here now. - [Detective] Dispatch, relay the correspondence from Officer Richards. - [Officer Raymond] Uh huh. - [Dispatcher] Just got word from County, there's an APB out on Samantha Brown. Code 240, aggravated assault, so proceed with caution. - Okay, will do. [ominous music] [knife stabbing] [Officer Raymond gasping] - Shh! Don't wake dad. Shh. [Officer Raymond coughing and gasping] Oh, why is this happening to me? [Officer Raymond gurgling] This is not working out at all! [dial tone ringing] [cell phone buzzing] - Hello? - Katherine Whitman? Is this Katherine Whitman? - [Kate] Yes? - This is Danica. [somber music] - What are you talking about? Who is this? - [Danica] Are you alone? - Well, that's none of your business, actually. Is this some kind of joke? - It-it's not a joke! My name is Danica Tyrell. You gave me up for adoption when you were 16 years old. And the girl who's pretending to be me is not your daughter. - Okay, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay... - I know this sounds crazy. Just listen to what I have to say. - Look, if this is just some kind of weird-- - You are in danger! You have to believe me! Her name is Samantha Brown, and she is mentally unstable. And now she stopped taking her meds. Please, just trust what I have to say is true. - No, you don't get everything, Danica. You don't get everything. It's gonna be okay. Sam, it's gonna be okay... - Where are you calling from? - Safe Harbor Group Home. But that-that's not important right now. What's important is that you get as far away from her as possible, right now! Please, promise me! - Look, I'm-I'm sorry, but I have to go. - [Danica] No, wait! - Hey... It's okay. Let's find her. - What's happening? Samantha? I... Danica? Who is Samantha? It doesn't make sense... What's happening? [ominous music] [Kate gasping] Joseph? Joseph? Oh, oh! [breathing heavily] You're okay? She, she didn't hurt you? - I-I'm, I'm fine. - Thank God! - What's going on? - Where's Samantha? - [Joseph] Samantha? - I mean, I mean Danica, where is she? - What are you talking about? - I talked to her, she called me! Not the-the Danica, she called me, my daughter, my real daughter! And, oh, and I should have seen it I-- - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - I put you, I put us in danger! - Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate! Everything, everything's fine, okay? Everything's fine. - No, no, Joseph! Everything, everything isn't fine! There's a dead police officer on our porch! [Kate crying] - I don't know what happened, but we are going to be okay. Look, whoever she was, whatever she's doing, she's gone. [foreboding music] - Joseph? I need to go see my real daughter. - Now? - Yes, now. I need to make this right. I-I don't know how... But I know I need to try. Can you please trust me? [sighing] - I trust you. Go get her. - [Kate] You gonna be okay? - Yeah. [sighing] [somber music] [knocking] - [Ms. Hanson] Hi. - Um... I'm Kate Whitman. I'm here to see my daughter. - Danica. - Yeah. - Please, come in. I've known Danica for, well, longer than I would have liked to, if you know what I mean. But she is very special, Mrs. Whitman. - I know. Well, I don't really know. But when I heard her voice-- - Oh, I know, I was sitting right there. And she just lit up. I mean, between you and me, it took all I had not to break down and cry like a baby. And people will tell you, I do not cry. - I've heard. - She's in there. It's okay, she won't bite. Go ahead. - Danica? [foreboding music] She's here... Samantha? But how did she-- - The window. It-- - What? - It leads to the roof. - Oh! - You're jealous, just stop it! Those messages to Melissa! "She's not who she says she is, don't trust her", why would you do that? - I'm sorry! - [Samantha] Shut up! - Samantha? - [Danica] Mom? - Mom? Mom? - Samantha, I need you to listen to me very carefully. Okay? This isn't gonna change anything-- - Yes it will! Yes it will, mom, you know it will! She's the reason that you can't love me, you know that! - Please Samantha, please don't kill me! Please don't do it! - Shut up! - It's okay! It's okay honey, we're gonna work through this, okay? - See, mom, do not call her honey! You know I don't like that! It really hurts my feelings, mom! - You're my honey too. Baby, I mean, you can both be. Just please, don't make me choose, I don't want to do that. Look, listen honey-- - No you don't! - No, I do, you're my honey too! What we have, no one can ever take that away from us, ever. [sirens wailing] Okay, do-do you remember our barbecue? And how we worked on that garden together? And our trip to the-the cabin? Those are our memories, and no one can ever take that away from us, ever! - Momma, I did really bad things, mom! - I know. - [Samantha] I did really, really bad things! [knife clattering] [Samantha crying] - Get on the ground! You're under arrest! Put your hands on your head and interlock them in the air where we can see them! - Momma, mom, mom, help! - Now! Put your hands on your head! Put your hands on your head! [Samantha crying and whining] - Momma! Mom! Momma! Mom! - Hands behind your back! Stop resisting the officer! - Mommy, please! [Samantha crying] I'm sorry! Mom, please, no! Mommy please, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, mom! [both crying] [somber music] - I'm Kate. And I'm your mom. - I'm Danica, and I'm your daughter. - I'm so sorry. I love you! [both crying] [light music] [Ms. Hanson chuckling] - Oh, and that's it! - For real this time? - She's the real deal. You have my word. - And we got the DNA test to prove it. - Whoo! You are all mine now! - I wish I could say the same. - Oh, stop it. You know you'll always be my first. - My girls. - Can this day get any better? I don't think so. - Thank you so much for everything. I couldn't have done any of this without you. - You really mean that? Oh, like that? No, that wasn't me. This was you, and a little bit of Joseph. - I mean it. I love you. - Stop it, you're gonna make me cry. - Ladies and gentlemen, introducing The Whitmans. - Oh, the perfect family. [loud scraping] [knocking] [foreboding music] - You had a good group session today. You must be cold. - Thank you, Dr. Hopewell. Dr. Hopewell? - Yes, dear? - Is mother coming to visit me? - [Dr. Hopewell] Honey, your mother is-- - 'Cause I miss her a lot. And I'm sure she feels the same. - Well, I'm sure she does too. - A mother and a daughter should never be apart. It's just unnatural. Did you know I was a love child? - [Dr. Hopewell] Well, Samantha, that certainly is something. - Danica. My name is Danica...
