[roaring] [orchestral music] [music continues] [whistling] [whistling] - Well! - Hi, Maisie, what's new? Come on, let's go. Didn't you hear the whistle? Okay, you don't have to jump down my throat. [drill whirring] There's still a war going on, you know? - I've heard some rumors. - Next, next. - Next! - Listen, Ravier. That's all, I'm going to take from you. Oh, dry up. Lead man, lead man! Oh, pipe down, honey. I'm sorry, I'll behave. - Come on, let's go. - What's the matter now? Well, I won't work with her, anymore. Oh, you won't? You can just get me a new girl, too. - And, don't you wink at me! - You winked at me. But I can't help it, I'm nervous. Gee, doc. I don't know, what ails me and that's the gospel truth. Between you and I, I think I'm going bats. Can't sleep? - Right eyelid twitches? - Mm-hmm. - Easily upset. - Yeah, you can say that, again. I might be an absentee, heaven forbid, if this is the way I am. How long have you been working here, Miss Ravier? Uh, 16 months. - Hmm, no time off? - Time off? What do you think I am, a dilettanti? - Now, now, now.. - You'll have to excuse me, doc. I'm just not myself. What do you do with your leisure time? Plenty of rest? Any sports? Well, uh, we have this nursery in our block, for the day shift's kids and.. ...I work there, mornings. I see. Sleep here at midnight. Go to work at the nursery at.. 5.30 AM. Mm-hm. How long have you been suffering with this nictitating spasm? Well, it's-- - The what? - This tic. This involuntary glad eye you've been giving everyone. Oh! For the last six weeks. And talk about embarrassing, say. I can well imagine. Here's a little prescription that'll fix you up. Well, thanks, doc. I don't like being a crab. Oh, gee! I don't know. Do you think I should with so much to do? Even soldiers have to have furloughs. [swing music] [music continues] [clapping] Well, Maisie, what I'm really trying to say is we all want you to know, you have our best wishes for a happy vacation and a good rest. [clapping] Thanks, kids. And to you especially, Elaine. I call it more than swell of you after what you've been taking from me the last couple months. Skip it. I didn't know you're nerves were all shot to pieces. Yeah. Gee, two weeks with pay. It's like a dream. - Maisie! - Oh, Tommy! How are you, Tommy? - Where did he come from? - Hey, quiet, girls. Mr. Cutter happens to have a wife and four kids. Five, as of last reports. Jeepers! Come here, I want to talk to you privately. Maisie, it's good to see you. What have you been up to? - Riveting. - You're kidding! That I am not! Essential, that's me. I'm just starting a two weeks' vacation on account I'm a frazzle of nerves. Gee, Tommy, hearing your aggregation makes me wish I was back working for you. Make believe, I don't. You could do more than any singer I ever had. -What you doing? - Me and the gals open in Reno. At the El Presidente Hotel, for two weeks. No kidding! A class joint at last, huh? Say, you've got a vacation. Why don't you spend it with us? Oh, no. Mm-hm. I'm strictly supposed to rest. That's what I mean. You sing a couple of numbers at night. In the day, sit around in the sun pickin' up vitamins. Believe me, that's all I want to pick up, the way I feel. What say? It'll make a new woman of you, if you can get there. Well, uh, what's the hitch? Well, you know, how travel is today. We had to book our train tickets weeks in advance. But if you could grab a bus or something. All I do is sing few numbers at night and the rest is free? Sure! All you've got to do is get there. Well, don't worry. I'll get there. I'll grab me a bus or if worse comes to worse, roller skates. Attagirl! I'll see you later. - Roger. - Roger. [man on P.A.] 'Stage 12, loading at gate 3 for immediate departure.' Hey, take it easy. Too bad about you. There's a war on. Yeah, we have to rehearse for it here? [footsteps] They ought to warn you when the tide's coming in. Look, buddy, I've got to get to Diego. I'm two days late, already. We're all sold out, soldier. Look, my husband's expecting me at Camp Roberts. - Yes? - Ticket to Reno, please? - Reno? - Yes. What you doing in six weeks, cutie? What do you care? You'll be in the brig. - When do you wanna go to Reno? - Today. We're all sold out for three weeks. Look, I got to get there tomorrow. - Nothing for three weeks. - Oh, but I-- - I want to turn in this ticket. - 'Cashier's window.' I'll stand all the way to Reno. Dearie, come here. Don't go, make it up with him. Even a bad hubby is better than no hubby at all. Thanks for your interest in my case, madam, but-- I was all set to go this afternoon, but we made it up. Lady, tell it to Mr. Anthony, will ya? I've-- You're cashing in a ticket to Reno? Indeed I am, dearie. I put my pride in my pocket. I apologized. Now, why don't you go along home and say, "Daddy, I'm sorry."? Well, look, lady. I'm not married. Got a job waiting in Reno. Sell me that ticket, huh? Alright. Maybe, while you're there, you'll catch a hubby. - There's lots of men in Reno. - A regular hubby lovie, huh? - How much do I owe you? - 8.70 plus tax, 9.57. Okay, here, keep the change and thanks a million. Thank you. Hey, prince charming, when does the Reno bus pull out? - '4:30.' - Roger. Hi, soldier. Think you knew me or think you'd like to? Oh, I'm not trying to flirt with you. Oh, well, a girl can't bat a thousand all the time. I want to ask your advice. You can help me. Look, sergeant, my bus pulls out in a couple of minutes. This'll all be decided by the time the bus leaves. Hey, you AWOL? What? Oh, no, no. Oh, then go ahead and tell me. Uh, not here. Come on. [man on P.A.] 'Attention, all military police report to Lt. Brown's office.' 'All military police report to Lt. Brown's office.' - What'll you have, a coke? - Uh, two cokes. Look, here it is. A friend of mine, not much tall, but smart and ambitious. He went to college, worked his way through. - Hash slinger, sock salesman. - Mm-mm. He met a girl, up in Stanford. Freshman, when he was a senior. Stanford, 1941. I knew your face was familiar! You mean, we've met? Only on goal lines, mister. I'm a football fan. You were always tops at running interference so the other guy could score. You got the broken ribs and he got the press notices. Well, let's skip the football and get back to cases. Okay. And let's skip that "friend of mine" routine, huh? The guy you're talking about is you? Yeah, that's right. [laughing] Well...I met a girl. - Very beautiful. - Mm-hm. - Very sweet. - Mm-hm. - And very, very rich. - Oh, oh. But she-she dressed like all the others. Never put on any lugs. Didn't want anybody to know-- She had a million, in the bank. She thought she was getting away with it, too. We fell in love. I finished school. - And you got married. - Yeah, very quietly out here. - No kids? - No. The day after Pearl Harbor, I enlisted. Sure, I was married but-but she had plenty. Uh, more than plenty, if you'd ask me. My enlisting and leaving her was the first shock. And then finding out I knew about the trust fund all along. Well, you didn't marry her for that. Then, out of the blue, one day she said something about a divorce. Ah, gee! If you really loved each other, couldn't you have ironed it out? Well, usually I'm pretty smart. But not then. I said if that's the way you feel about it...go ahead. - And she went ahead? - 'Yeah.' The next day I woke up, I began to realize what I'd lost. But by then, she'd packed up and left. Well, you must have wrote her? 'Of course, I wrote her and phoned and wired.' When she didn't answer at first, that didn't bother me. She's stubborn. She'd miss me. - As much as you missed her. - 'Yeah.' But that's been almost six weeks now. Yesterday, I found out why she's so dead set against me. Somebody's been telling her lotta things that aren't true. I've got to tell her they're not. - Can you get a furlough? - 'I've got it. Fifteen days.' Well, then what are you waitin' for? Wherever she is, get yourself there, quick. That's what I hoped you'd say. That's why I brought you in here. To tell you to do what you're all set to do, anyhow? Uh-huh, to tell me that. And to do one thing more. What's that? When I was playing football.. ...we had a word we used when a guy got in a tight spot. - It's skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo. - Skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo? 'Really?' It means, there's a man in the way.. ...block him out. Help the fella with the ball. I'm not wearing shoulder pads. What's that gotta do with me? Well, everything. I'm saying it to you now. Skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo. What am I supposed to do? - Give me your ticket to Reno. - Oh. Congratulations, sergeant. - That was pretty smooth. - Not smooth. Desperate. They're sold out for three weeks. By then she'll have a decree, and I'll be outta the country. I've-I've got to have a ticket. I've gotta job at the El Presidente Hotel in Reno. I'll pay you whatever it's worth. I don't know how or when, but I will. Well, okay. Kinda wish you hadn't tricked me into it, but.. ...here you are. Gee, thanks. You're swell! Well, thanks again. - And you're really swell. - Hey, wait up. - That will be 9.57, soldier. - Oh, I forgot. Uh, there's nine-nine fifty. - That's all the change I got. - That's alright, skip it. - I'll go to the bus with you. - Oh, swell. You give me your name and address and I'll send you the rest of it. - That's on the level above-- - That's okay. You might send me a card, let me know how you're getting along. Alright. That's swell. [man on P.A.] 'Stage 8 for Bakersfield.' 'Fresno, Merced, Modesto, Carson City and Reno.' 'Loading gate for immediate departure.' What's your name and address now? It's Maisie Ravier. 82 Heliotrope Terrace, Burbank. - May I see your pass, sergeant? - Uh-oh. Report back to camp immediately, sergeant. Oh, but that's a 15-day pass. My-my C.O. signed it. I've got 15 days. No, your outfit's been alerted to transfer to a new post. - All leaves cancelled. - But this is an emergency. Sorry, sergeant. On your way. Ah, gee. That's a shame. [bus driver] 'All aboard.' Oh, well, here's your ticket. - And give her this, will you? - Wait a minute-- I wrote it just in case I couldn't get there. But don't mail it, understand? Please, don't mail it. Give it to her and make her read it. And tell her how I feel. Yeah, but I can't do that. I-I don't know her! - Skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo. - But, uh-- [engine revving] - Here's your money. - Oh, thanks. Be sure and give it to her in person. Don't mail it, please. Please, sit down, lady.

Honey, these days you don't even throw the little one's back. Where are you going? I got to locate this party I was telling you about. - I want to get this off. - But we're going to eat now. - Roger. - Yeah. With mayonnaise. Be seein' you. [crowd mumbling] [waltz music] Take a card. - Take a walk. - Thanks. I will. [music continues] Is Mrs. William Fullerton stopping here? Mrs. Fullerton was a guest here. She's checked out. Well, could you tell me where she is? I'm not at liberty to give out that information. If you write a note, we'll forward it to her. - This is something personal. - I'm sorry. - But if you could-- - I'm sorry. Take a card. Look, sleight of hand. I'm busy. Take a card. Put it back. You a friend of Gloria Fullerton's? You a talent scout for the quiz kids? - Five of spades. - Hey, that's good. Why do you wanna see Gloria Fullerton? - Why do you wanna know? - Because I like your voice. And you gave me a steam-heated wink. It so happens that is no wink. It's a nictitating spasm. On you, it looks a wink. I figured I could use knowing where to locate Mrs. Fullerton as a way to get acquainted with you. Oh, well, I have to deliver this letter from her ex-husband to be, maybe. Give it to me. Ah-huh! I said I'd deliver it personally. You're the wrong type for a mailman. Why monkey in people's business? It'll get you in trouble. - Well, you ought to know. - Give it to me. I'll address it and I'll buy you a drink. I don't drink. Where is she? At the ranch about 10 miles out, Joan's ranch. Well, could you tell me the phone number? - No phone. - No phone. - Joan's ranch, huh? - Mm. I'll be back for the midnight show. If you make that drink a root beer, you're on. - You were planning to walk? - Planning to grab me a cab. No cabs. We go in my car. Using what for gas? I've been saving my cue points for important trips. Oh! And this shapes up as being important. Important. Is that the Reno word for impertinent? I guess it's important. A couple lives may be affected. That's what I figured. Suppose you change and then I'll meet you outside. - Hello, Flip. - Hello, Donna. Flip. Flip. They call you that on account you flip the cards? Name's Philip Francis Hennahan. - Oh! Why, Flip? - Say Philip fast. - Philip. - Faster. - Philip. - Faster. - Flip. - You got it. See you. [upbeat music] Some ranch. I bet even the cows have red polish in their toenails. Look, I'll only be long enough to convince this character she shouldn't divorce this soldier. Why don't you just use that to hold up your powder? Meaning what precisely? Meaning, keeping out of other people's business. I'll only be a minute. [bell ringing] Yes. I'd like to see Mrs. Fullerton, please? Mrs. Fullerton's not in. Like to leave a message? - I've got this letter here-- - I'll see that she gets it. Oh, thanks. But I said I'd give it to her myself. Is the letter from Sergeant Fullerton? Well, I can't give it to any intermediate. If she's out-- Please, wait. Mrs. Fullerton will see you. Say, she got back awful quick. Ordinarily, I wouldn't disturb her so late. But, uh...this way. Uh, look...I don't know who you are but I'd sooner see her alone. - Certainly. Right in here. - Thanks. Good evening. I understand you have a letter for me. - Well, are you Mrs. Fullerton? - Yes. Oh. Oh, I had kind of a different type picked out for you. Not knowing you, of course, just hearing your hus-- I mean sergeant speak about you. - Do sit down. - Oh, thanks. Have you known Bill long? The truth is I don't know him at all. I started talking to him in this bus station. Oh, let me give you some coffee. Thanks. I can't stay long. - How about a cordial. - Sure, if you've got some made. - Green mint? - Sure. Any color. So, uh, you met Bill in a bus station and he gave you a letter for me? Well, yes. He meant to come personally, but at the last minute, uh.. ...this M.P. told him he was being transferred and well.. He asked me to put this into your hands, which I guess I'd better do without further ado. Thank you, Miss, uh.. Oh, get me, I didn't introduce myself. My name is Maisie Ravier. Thank you very much, Miss Ravier. Do me a favor and read it now, will you? I'd like to tell him I knew for sure you read it. Very well. Alright, Miss Ravier, you can tell Bill I read his letter. It doesn't change your mind in any shape or form? I'm afraid not. I'm sorry to hear that. I know this is none of my business, Mrs. Fullerton. Just tonight, an acquaintance was balling me out for meddlin' in things, so to speak but, gee, he sure struck me as a fellow who's carrying a torch, if I ever seen one. Bill is very appealing. I believed he loved me once. I believed it enough to marry him. Finding out I was wrong was just the worst thing that ever happened to me. Well, you mean him knowing you had all this money? Oh, gee, Mrs. Fullerton, people can fall in love with a rich girl irrespective of their money. Not Bill, I'm afraid. Even in his letter he asked me for money. Money? In that letter there? Well, how'd you like that? I'm sorry, Mrs. Fullerton. Please, pardon me for buttin' in. I know you brought me this letter from the kindest motive. Thank you very much, Miss Ravier. Ah, skip it. I was way out of line. Well, goodnight, Mrs. Fullerton. - Best of luck. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Roger. [buzzing] Katie's out. I better see what she wants. [female #1] 'Come in, Katie.' It's not Katie, Mrs. Fullerton. I let her and Sam drive into town after dinner. - Something I can get you? - No, thanks, Miss Ashbourne. I was gonna ask her to warm some milk for me. These darn sleeping pills seem to work a little better if I take them in milk, but I'll get it myself. You just stay in bed and I'll bring it to you right away. - Still not sleepy? - No. I keep wishing things were.. ...were the way I used to think they were. There's no sense in it I know, but.. ...I can't seem to help it. How do you like that soldier turning out to be a four star general heel. What did dear papa tell you about your nose? Well, you kinda inferred you liked it. Out of other people's business. Oh, okay. Does that wind up your career as a repairer of broken homes? Hopefully not. Good. Maybe, we both can get some lamps while we're here. Dealing blackjack doesn't take up all my time. - Say, what about that any way? - What? You doing that kind of work? For me, it's strictly a vacation and doctor's orders at that, but a big husky guy like you-- - Ah-huh! - Oh! Sorry. Oh, gee, will you look. Mrs. Fullerton's matchbox. Turn around, Flip. I'll give it back to her. You can leave it at the hotel desk, she comes in every day. With that swell layout, she don't cook home? Has to see the manager once a day to prove she hasn't left the state. Don't tell me Mrs. Tinplates would run out on a hotel bill. No, not exactly. The hotel manager is a residential witness for her divorce. Oh. Why didn't you tell me she came into the hotel every day? I, uh, wanted to drive you out and back. Any objections? No. [engine stuttering] Uh-oh! - What's the matter? - I think I'm out of gas. You can just start it up, Bub. The answer is no. Maisie, on the level, I'm out of gas. And I'm out of the car. But look at the gauge. Never mind the gauge, I'm walkin'. 'It's a good three miles.' Well, I'm glad something's good around here. Well, you can't walk. With the practice I've had. Huh. [car honking] Take a car. [phone ringing] Miss Ravier speaking. - Who? - Fullerton. Sergeant Fullerton. I've been transferred to Camp Roberts. - I gave you a letter, remember? - Oh! Sergeant Fullerton. Well, how's your personal war chest doing? I-I don't get you. Never mind about that. Did you give Gloria the letter? Yes, she got the letter okay. She didn't say much. Well, how did she look? Well, she looks pretty sad. Who can blame her? She married cash on the line, Fullerton. Uh, what kind of double-talk is that? Double-cross talk. It sure ain't smart of you, sergeant, let alone disgusting. Maybe you'd get some money if you didn't let your itchy palm show so plain. I'm hanging up, sergeant. I do not like you. Hello. Hello. Philip. Philip. Flip. [Roger] 'C'mon, Clave. Pull yourself together.' Listen, Pelham. Never worry about me. We want this letter to give to Gloria in the morning. - Tomorrow morning. - Never fear. Head may be a little bit woozy but I can always write. Backhand, forehand and vertigo. Don't review you career. Just write this now. - In Bill Fullerton's hand. - Cinch. Know it by heart. Never forget a handwriting. - You start. - Dearest Gloria. Once again, darling, I beg you not to go through with the divorce. Divorce. Well, a little cleverly huh? Cute. Never mind the comments. - What's next, Roger? - Paragraph. Gloria. whatever you may think of me now.. Now. ...after all, I am your husband. Husband. And you owe me something. Something. It's impossible to live on my army pay. [instrumental music] - You ride very well, Maisie. - Well, thanks. - You mean for a riveter. - Ha-ha. - Is this it? - Yup. - Can you get off? - Well, I got on. Maybe, I'd better help you. What's in, in here? Practically nothing. Till we get in there. And then? You're the nosiest dame I ever met. Come on in. Make yourself at home. You like it? Has all the comforts of a covered wagon. A little hideout I found. Sort of a rustic wolf den, huh? I haven't brought girls here, if that's what you're asking. - You're the only one. - You come here to be alone? You try to sleep in the daytime at that hotel you'll think you're in the riveting factory. I come here practically every day and sleep myself back into making sense. Ah, wanna try? - That? - Great for the nervous system. [laughing] - Nice, huh? - Ah! When I'm back home working swing shift I'll see this place in my mind's eye. Only the place? Oh, I'll remember the company, too. Now, you're talking. Relax. - Not bad, huh? - Well. Hey. That wink of yours must've given me the wrong idea. - Look, Flip, I explain-- - Sure, sure, relax. After all, the two of us are strangers or next door to it. We needn't be. Now, Flip, we just met last night. And what we know about each other is that I'm singing with the band a couple weeks and you deal blackjack. Last night, you thought I was dealing the bottom of the deck. Now, it turns out that I had a pure heart and an empty tank. We're still a long ways from being well-acquainted. What do you wanna do? Correspond for a couple years? No. But it's just that I don't know anything about you. - I'm a gambler, honey. - I like a safe bet, honey. I don't even know whether you're married or not. - How about you? - No. Any strings? Well, there was a guy, a pilot. But he got interested in studying the native dances. In Dallas, Texas. Well, then? You won't get mad if I ask you something? No. What? - Where is she? - She? Your loving wife. What is this? Well, you must be married and have four kids or something. Otherwise. You don't look exactly like a four F. You are the nosiest dame I ever met. Well, gee, Flip, you gotta expect people to wonder about things like that these days. Okay, okay, so you gotta know everything. A sniper let a little air through me in Sicily and the war department thought I'm better here where I didn't whistle on windy nights. Oh, Flip, I'm sorry. I volunteered to get into the army and had nothing to say about getting out. It's one thing I don't like to talk about, but you asked. Gee, wounded in action. Does it hurt much? I know when it's gonna rain. Makes you feel better? Oh, I just knew it had to be something like that. Okay, so I'm not married and I'm not a draft dodger. 'Anything else you wanna know?' Not right now. What are we wasting time for? - Wait a minute. - What now? I mean I feel. Uh, I mean, how do you feel? More questions. Well, I'll tell you. I'm riding on a cloud baby and I'm not giving anybody my seat. Oh! What's wrong now? But, gee, I only met you yesterday. Too quick, huh? And now, Flip, if you think every time I wink it means put your arms around me, honey, we're gonna get awfully tired. Well, quit winking then. Well, I can't help it. It's involuntary. And this is voluntary. Oh, honey. Let's get back on the horses. I think I'm on a merry-go-round. - Don't you wanna be? - Well, yeah, well. I just think let's both take it easy. After all, I'm gonna be here couple of weeks and there's still a lot we ought to know. More questions? Alright, ask me. Well, I mean about me. You don't know anything about me. Well, give out. Give out. Okay, honey. But it takes time to give out. C'mon. And thanks for saying, "give out." [swing music] Mm. This is good. How can you drink that stuff? Lemonade is for kids at circuses. You sure are touchy about something. Oh, I oughta have my head examined. - Why? - I don't know. I never ran after a girl like this in my life. - Mm-hmm. - I mean it. Take it easy, take it easy. What for? Do I have to bring flowers and take you to the movies a whole year before I can convince you? A girl does like to have flowers and a little romance before she's married. Heaven knows, few of them get it after. Don't know why I'm sitting here. There's plenty of other women in the world. - Plenty. - Good sports, good pals. - No questions asked. - Hmm. - As for instance. - Huh. - Her. - Who? The girl with the endowments that just passed. - When? - You didn't see her? - No. - Well. I guess I'm doing alright. Oh, there's Mrs. Fullerton. What now? I'm merely going to return her matchbox. Be right back. - Oh, Mrs. Fullerton. - Yes. I just wanted to give Mrs. Fullerton back her matchbox. - I'm Mrs. Fullerton. - No, she's Mrs.. Huh? I'm Mrs. Fullerton. I think that is a matchbox from the ranch. You're Mrs. Fullerton? Well, then, may I ask just whom that was that left? Oh, that's my secretary, Miss Winifred Ashbourne. Mrs. Fullerton, there's something you ought to know. You just stay where you are. I was at your house last night. - With a letter by your husband. - Yes. This character whoever he thinks he is met me at the door. - Yes, but-- - Just go ahead and deny it. He passed that woman off as you. Well, and how is the pseudo Mrs. Fullerton, today? Ask them what they did with that letter? Just ask them. Oh, yes, The letter that my husband gave you. I think I have it with me now. Yes, here it is. Mr. Pelham and Miss Ashbourne told me about your bringing it. Up to and including her passing herself off as you? I'm sorry, but you see there's been some people from the newspapers and I don't like to see anybody I don't know and they didn't know anything about you. But it was very kind of you to bring the letter, thank you. Well, now, just a minute. I'm by no means satisfied. - Call for Mrs. Fullerton? - No, for Mr. Pelham. Give me the phone. - Well, plug it in. - Yes, sir. [Maisie] 'They had no right to read that letter.' I think that's a matter that concerns me Mr. Pelham and Miss Ashbourne. Mr. Parsons, I ask you to see that Miss Ravier doesn't annoy Mrs. Fullerton. Mrs. Fullerton has to contend with-- Contend? Who's contending? I'm trying to wise her up is all. Mrs. Fullerton simply won't come to the hotel anymore. You are an employee of this hotel. 'I'll see you in my office.' Yes, sir. Shall I bring the whip along or do you keep one handy? Go away. I wish you'd call your husband, go on. Go to my office at once. Yes, sir. - Mr. Pelham, it was your call. - Oh, thanks. And really, Mrs. Fullerton, I assure you I regret this happening. But I promise you it will not happen again. [Clave] 'Hello, Pelham.' 'I hate to interrupt you, I'm in a bad run in' 'my luck at blackjack.' Yeah, I see. Well, uh, that generally happens if you stay with it. So I find myself kind of short, see. I don't wanna come in the dining room while you're with you understand. I don't wanna make a trip out to the ranch. 'So how can we get together?' This afternoon. Uh, just a minute. Okay, understand I wouldn't want to inconvenience you in the smallest degree. I'll be in my room in an hour. And I know I'll be hearing from you. So long. What're you doing here? Come into my office. Well, now, listen, Mr. Parsons, I had no intention of annoying Mrs. Fullerton, it was a highly personal matter. Mr. Parsons, Miss Ravier's been working hard in a war plant. Maybe, she's a little nervous and quick tempered. That's okay, Flip. Please don't apologize for me. - When I see monkey business. - It won't occur again. How can I be sure? The girl's been here one day and already there's been a scene. - My guarantee mean anything? - Oh, now, look Flip-- If you overlook this, you have my word she won't cause trouble. If she does, you can fire the pair of us. Alright, then I'll hold you responsible. Who's mixing in other people's business, now? Isn't a question of that at all? He makes me sore. Well, anyway, thanks for speaking up for me. If there's ever anything I can do to repay you.. Oh, pardon me. I thought you were alone. - Say, what about him, anyhow. - What about him? - Who is he? - Name's Clave. - What's he do? - I don't know. I watched him a little while ago. He struck me as a very suspicious.. What did I tell you about that nose? Sorry. Maisie, if I'm not rushing you fast, how about having supper with me tonight? - Okay. - Seven? - Right. - Listen, angel face. Drop this Fullerton routine, will you? Parsons wasn't kidding. And we might as well have this couple of weeks here. We might as well. - See ya. - Ah-huh. Bye. Bye. - Hi, Jerry. - Good evening, Miss Ravier. - You know something? - What, Miss Ravier? I'm a mind reader. - You are? - Uh-huh. If you wanna slap my face, you got a right. I can't help it, Miss Ravier. I got an intense nature. Oh, honey. If I were ten years older, I'd adopt you. And if you were ten years older, who knows.. But no kidding, I am psychic. I bet you I could tell you who that note is for. - The one you got there. - Oh, you could? Sure. Come on inside, I'll show you. Here, now, give it to me. Now, I'll close my eyes, so I won't see the name on it. Okay...take my hand. In connection with this object, I vibrate to earth. - C. - Yeah. C and L. C-L-A-V-E. Say, that's-that's right. Mr. Clave in 309. Mr. Clave. Well, what do you know. We're old friends. Jerry...let me pull a gag, huh? Let me take this to him. Well, we're not strictly supposed to. Oh, Mr. Pelham wouldn't mind. Honest. We're old friends, too. It's a regular reunion around here. Well, did Mr. Pelham send this here? Can you read that off it, too? Oh, sure. He did send it, didn't he? I don't know. The bell captain gave it to me. I'm sure it was him. They're old friends, right? Mr. Clave and Mr. Pelham? I'm sure you've brought messages from one to the other many times, huh? In my line of work, you don't know who's friends with whom. Least of all in Reno. Oh, well, let me take it to him for a laugh. Well, okay. Let me walk to the door, to feel I've done the correct thing. Okay. But stay outta sight, so you don't spoil the gag. Okay. Well! This is an unexpected pleasure. Come on in. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Say, I think I'm gonna like Reno after all. Clave...Tom told me to give you this. Thanks. Wasn't you down in the lobby when I was on the phone? - Yeah. - Where you've been all my life? Oh, I've been here, there, and everywhere. What's with you and Pelham? Well, what's with any of us and Pelham? - You in? - Huh? - He cut you in? - Oh, sure. How much? Well, same as any of us in my line, I mean, I mean.. - Yeah? What's your line? - Who me? Oh, I'm versatile. Anything that pays off. - What's yours? - On that we gotta have a drink. Well, I don't drink. But on second thought, why not? You're cute. You kill me. This one, you'll have to take with water. We'll get the next round on it's way. Okay. You know, I get the feeling that I've seen you some place. Could be. I've been some place. I had an uncle who got into trouble back east. You know something, beautiful? I don't care about your uncle. I'm only interested in you. Wait a minute. I won't be able to think of anything else till I get this straight. Uncle Joe was in the big house. I used to visit him regularly. Maybe, that's where I saw you. - Sweetheart, what's your name? - Ravier. Maisie Ravier. - Maisie, huh? - Uh-huh. Cute name for a cute little package. But my uncle.. You sure you've never been in Stir? Sure I ain't never seen you before, doll baby. You, I couldn't forget. Here's to the two of us, Maisie. May we go places. Well, if we're gonna go places, pal we better start getting acquainted. Baby, you can say that again. What about that next round? But you haven't touched that one yet. Don't worry. I'll polish this off. Okay. [Clave] 'Room service.' 'Two scotches and sodas in 309.' 'Doubles. And hurry up.' Now, supposing I tell you all about me then you tell me all about you, huh? Maisie, that wink you gave me downstairs told me the whole story. Uh, but not all of it. - No? - No. Now, me, I've had quite a history. - Yeah? - Yes, sir. Juvenile delinquent at ten-- How we gonna get acquainted if you sit in a chair like that? Might as well be comfy, eh, beautiful? Then, I took up shoplifting for a while. But it wasn't till my first con game, I really hit my stride. Now, tell me about you. Over here. Gee, you sure got an unusual hand. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let me guess what line of work you're in from your hand. Look, sweetheart, if we're gonna play games. - Let's play 'em sittin' down. - But wait a minute. Could it be, uh, locks and safes, maybe? Oh, I'm safe, sugar. But not too safe. Uncle Joe used to brag he could open any safe that was made. You got plenty to brag with pair of games like that. - Yeah, but my uncle-- - Where you going? Come back-- Let me show you what my Uncle Joe used to do! He'd rub his fingertips in the carpet, like this. Then, he'd take a little sandpaper and he-- My Uncle Moe used to have a cute trick, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. He'd take one arm, see, and he'd put it around a babe like you. - Wait a minute. - Then, he'd take the other arm. [knock on door] Now, just a minute. You better answer the door. Yes, yes. Oh, okay. [knock on door] - Yeah? - 'Room service.' Okay, sonny. Don't you think you better order another round while you got him here? Something tells me I'll be glad to see Jerry again very soon. You think of everything, honeybunch. Another round, half-pint. Very good, Mr. Clave. [Clave] 'Lovely, you know something?' [Maisie] 'Honeybun, I know everything except about you.' Oh. - Sorry, Mr. Hennahan. - That's okay, Jerry. [Clave] 'Maisie, you not only got a pretty leg' 'you got a hollow one.' Oh, Mr. Clave, you ought to be on the stage. You're so comical. Come on. Let's go back to our little cozy-- [Maisie] 'Oh, yeah, but we can't let these drinks get warm, can we?' [Clave] 'Come on, Maisie. Somebody left the door open.' 'Fine thing. I'm gonna shut it.' [Maisie] 'Yeah, we gotta have a long, private talk.' [door shuts] Yes, sir, we have to talk over our plans and Pelham's. Especially my plans, Maisie. I got lots of plans. [knocking on door] Oh, Jerry, honey, we won't need any more drinks. Oh, I prefer dealing with Mr. Clave directly. Well, not to put too fine a point on it Mr. Clave has passed out cold. Pardon me. - Mr. Clave. Mr. Clave. - Hmm? Sir, the bar is closing. You've gotta settle up for these drinks. You can sign, if you wish. Run along, sonny boy. You bother me. Aw, Clavey, come on. Don't be like that. - Sign the checks for the kid. - Kid. Anything for Maisie. Anything Maisie wants. Yeah, that's right. Now, come on over. Get on the chair. That's right. And we'll take the little pen. And we'll take the little checks. And we'll put your little name on them. As drunk as I am, and I am drunk I can always write. [Clave] 'Here you are, tootsie-wootsie.' Nothing to it. Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Clave. I've only this to say to you, Miss Ravier. It's a shock to me personally that one so sharp-looking should be a mere coquette. Oh, that's okay, Jerry. Don't mention it. ♪ Penelope, Penelope ♪ ♪ Penelope, Penelope ♪ [Clave singing] [Clave] 'What's you up to, Maisie? Come here.' I'll be right there. 'Maisie.' Better go sleepy-bye, Mr. Clave. Sandman's coming. ♪ Penelope ♪ ♪ Penelope ♪ [Clave humming] Hello, operator. I want to put in a person-to-person call to Sergeant William Fullerton, located at Camp Roberts. Yeah. What? Don't concern yourself unduly, my friend. I'll settle for this call prior to checking out. Hurry up. [knock on door] Oh, Tommy. Maisie...where you been? You missed the supper show. Oh, Tommy, I bet, you're provoking. You got a right. Hello. But something came up that was-- More than me being provoked, the manager raised the roof. Knowing you, I told him you must have a good excuse but...gee, Maisie, I'm sorry. - Fired, huh? - That's about the size of it. Oh, gee, Tommy, I'm sorry for letting you down but it couldn't be helped. Thanks for everything. You can stay here tonight, but he wants the room in the a.m. Okay. Hello. Excuse me, Tommy. I've got to get this call. - I'll be seeing you. - Okay. Bill? Bill? This is me. Yeah, Maisie Ravier. Yeah. First, I want to apologize for whatever I said on the phone the other night. I'm on your side now, and how! Listen, Bill, you gotta get yourself out here quickly. Get myself there? Honey, what's the matter with you? I can't get there. It's absolutely impossible. Well, then you've got to do the impossible. Have a man-to-man talk with the general or something but get here. I can prove in black and white that all this trouble between you and her, I mean, your wife, is a put-up job. But the divorce comes up in the morning. What did you find out? Never mind what I found out. I've got evidence. You just get here by hook or crook. What? Well, you've got to do the impossible! It's skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo and I ain't foolin'. You get here! - I'll stand. - Hit me. Hit me again, not too hard. - Bust. - Tough luck, Mr. Pelham. This is sure your night, Miss Ashbourne. - Uh, Flip.. - I'm working. - Pardon me. - Pardoned. - Flip, something's come up. - I'm busy. - Yeah, but I want to tell-- - Beat it. [swing music] Maisie.. Where's my Maisie? How do you like that? [scotch dripping] - Flip. - Look, go play somewhere else. Flip, take a card. Any card. Excuse me. - Look at it. - So you know the tricks. You know lots of tricks. Now, beat it. No, Flip, you gotta try it again and look at it this time. I want to see if I can do it. [waiter] Call for Mr. Pelham. - Here, boy. - Telephone, sir. I'll be right back. This is one night I gonna quit a winner. Please, Flip. Take a good look. Okay. Your card was the two of diamonds? Right. Okay. - Playing, Miss Ashbourne? - I certainly am. [Winifred] 'I'll have you begging for mercy, pretty soon.' Hit me. - Winifred. - Just a minute, Roger. - Hit me again. - Come on, something's come up. Alright. 21, Mr. Hennahan. Pay 21. This has been your lucky night, alright. And my last. We're leaving tomorrow. Goodbye, Mr. Hennahan. It's been fun. Goodbye, Miss Ashbourne, Mr. Pelham. - We've enjoyed having you here. - Thanks. - Hurry up, will you, my dear? - Goodbye. George. George, take over. Oh, look, now, I'm eating my supper. Five minutes! Alright, but don't forget when I want a favor. Gee, honey, I couldn't feel worse about standing you up. If you're gonna apologize or explain about the date, skip it. Oh, no, there's a lot more to it. Oh, alright. - Hi, Jerry. - Hi. Well, what's this life and death matter? I heard Parsons canned you. Do you need some money? Oh, that, no. But it's sure sweet of you to offer. Flip, I know you told me to keep my nose out of the Fullerton business. Forget it. Do whatever you want. That's kind of different from what you said before dinner. You said some things before dinner, too. Yeah. I know, I passed my words and let the whole matter drop. But, Flip, it's no longer a hunch on my part or a suspicion. I've absolute proof that there's something crooked going on. Where did you find that proof? In Clave's room? - Yes. Uh.. - Mm-hm. But how did you know? Oh...that's what made the icicles grow. Oh, honey, I can clear that up. Let me tell you. - Don't bother. - Yeah, but, Flip.. Wait, till you hear. Uh, um.. They're out for Mrs. Fullerton's money. They wanna break up the marriage to gain a free hand. Pelham's in it, and Ashbourne, and Clave. - Do you suspect anyone else? - There may be more. The three, I know for sure. Clave's been forging letters. Hey...how do you happen to know all this? Don't worry how I know. I've got the goods. Evidence that will stand up in any court in the land. That why you were hanging around Clave? For evidence? Well, sure. Honey, I know up to now you've taken the attitude that I'm nuts but with the evidence I've got right here I'll blast this nefarious ring wide open. [knocking on door] Oh! Whoa. Calm down. [knocking on door] Yeah, who is it? [Jerry] 'I wish to speak to Miss Ravier, please.' - Jerry? - 'Yes.' Well, I can't come, right now. I'm busy. Miss Ravier, your whole future life is at stake. I ask you, please, to speak with me. What is it, Jerry? I cannot speak in the presence of others. - Miss Ravier-- - Is it about Clave? Oh, no, no, it's about you, Miss Ravier. - Is your mother alive? - Mama? No, she's dead and buried these ten years. Rest her soul. Why? If she was alive, she'd say to you what I'm about to say. Well, Jerry, for heaven's sake, spill it. Miss Ravier.. ...Maisie...I beg you to stop and ask yourself to where you are drifting to. To what? Well, you've got something good and fine about you, Miss Ravier. I'm a great judge of character. Oh, honey, you're sweet. Jerry, things aren't always as they seem. Dig me? Well, all I know is what I saw with my own eyes. First, 309, and now 102. Oh...uh, Jerry. Did you ever hear of J. Edgar Hoover? - Sure. - Okay. A word to the wise is sufficient. Do you need any help? I'm plenty rugged. Well, we'll have a password. Skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo. Is that FBI? It means "Block off the interference." I get you. You mean he's in the way. Flip? Oh, no, he's on our side. Oh, you've made me very happy, Miss Ravier. - Skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo. - Skiddle yourself, honey. - And remember, shh. - Yeah, okay. Excuse me, honey. Gee, is your attitude towards this whole matter gonna change when you see the proof right before your eyes. - I'd like to see it. - I've got it right here. Look, Maisie, I'm supposed to be working. What do you wanna show me? You've got to help me 'cause these people are tough. Yeah, yeah. I read Dick Tracy too. Where is that thing? I had it right here. Oh! I guess, you lost your alibi, huh? Well, that blotter was in my bag when I entered this room. - It's not there now. - Evidently not. - Quite evidently not. - What happened to it? I don't know. Do you? Yeah. I might've taken it. You were the only person in the room. - That's right. - Why would you wanna do that? I might be one of those crooks. Ever think of that? Not until now. I'm beginning to think you're nuts. What I'm beginning to think you are I wouldn't demean myself by saying. What kinda idiot do you take me for? You invent a story and when I call you a bluff to produce this evidence, you accuse me of stealing. Now, when I've got you dead to rights when I know you took that blotter outta my bag.. ...you've the cast iron gall to pretend you're all broken up about some romance between I and Clave. [phone ringing] [Flip] 'Hello?' Goodbye! Okay, George, I'm coming. [Jerry] 'Miss Ravier.' Oh, yeah.. You're wanted on the phone. Long distance. The army. - Oh, him. - You can take it in the booth. Okay. Miss Ravier speaking. I worked it, Maisie. I'm in the bus terminal in Salinas right now. Oh, Bill, that's a big load off my mind. Contact me the minute you get in and I'll tell you everything that's transpired. But you've got to go to Gloria, right now, tonight. I can't, Bill. They watch her like the U.S. Mint. Especially after all that's happened. No, that's impossible. The divorce will be granted and she'll leave before I can get there unless you show her the evidence. Well, Bill, there's no use horsing around. - I haven't got it. - But you told me you had it. I did have it, but it was stolen off me by the biggest rat of all. I'm bushed, Bill, I don't know what to do. Gloria would never believe me without any evidence and I can't get near her. You must, Maisie. I'm counting on you. Stop that divorce somehow, anyhow, but stop it. Look, my bus is pulling out right now. Don't fail me. Keep her out of that courtroom even if you've to kidnap her. And remember.. ...skiddle-de-ruff-ka-doo. Now, listen, Bill, it's all very fine to skiddle-de-ruff, but.. Hello? H.. Kidnap her? - Jerry. - Yes? - What time you're off? - Stroke of midnight. Stroke of midnight. Come to my room when you're through. Maybe, we can work something out. - A big job? - Yeah, a kidnap.. - Uh, colossal. - Oh, I'll be there. - Don't forget. - No. If I'd known you folks were coming, I'd have baked a snake. Miss Ravier, you mix too much in other people's business. Yeah, so I've been told...by your associate. - He didn't lose any time? - Not much. - Where's that blotter? - Huh? Don't stall around. You took it off the desk. I take back what I said. News travels slow in your set. You guys ought to get together. Come on. Give. Well, it so happens that that blotter is now in the United States mail. Registered. Special delivery. On its way to the proper authorities, too. Together with a sworn out deposition signed by me in front of a notary public. - She hasn't had time to do it. - Yeah. Start with this. Search away. You won't find anything. I'll be darned. It was stuck in the lining all the time. Look, I've got to see somebody right now and square myself. - Sit down, sister. - Hey, quit shovin'! She knows too much and she talks too much. She doesn't walk out in any shape to talk. - I'll take care of her? - Shut up. Stick to your penmanship. What harm can she do? Are you kiddin'? - 'Now, she has no evidence.' - 'She can still talk.' 'She's the talkinest dame I ever met.' Let her talk. Who'd believe her? Gloria might. That sentimental dope. She won't get within shouting distance of Gloria. We'll take care of that. That dame ain't beyond talking to the cops. [Pelham] 'Now, wait a minute. Imagine you're a police captain' That much imagination I ain't got. Shut up, Clave. Into the police station walks this dame. This common looking little bleach blonde-- Bleach? I'll show you my baby pictures. Ow! In walks this crazy little nobody fired from a plane plant. - Fired? I-- - Because she was off her head. She comes in with a story about some word she thought she saw. On a blotter she hasn't got. That's supposed to prove Gloria's business manager and her confidential secretary are crooks. How much stock would the police take in a story like that? From a silly little crumb like her. They'd laugh at her. You're right. She's harmless. Come along, Clave. [door shuts] Phew. [instrumental music] - Flip, listen, honey-- - Take some aspirin, will you? Let me have a chance-- Give me a chance to deal these cards. Okay. - Your room? - Yes, yes, okay. Scram. George. Oh, come now. Too much is plenty. Oh, Flip, honey, I want to apologize. I've been wrong in my life before but never this wrong. Save it till we get inside. I thought you stole the blotter, but I had it all the time. There's a hole in the lining of my bag. Yes, yes. Alright, Maisie. Well, you can't blame me. Well, yes, you can too. But here's what happened. First off, the soldier's on his way. - What soldier? - Fullerton. Her husband. - He's on his way now. - Oh. I told him that the evidence had been stolen. He kept saying I had to stop that divorce. Evidence or no evidence. Well, I was in a terrible predicament, as you can see. - Yes, Maisie. - Well, I go up to my room. Not knowing which way to turn. And there they are. - The three of them waiting. - What three was that? Clave, Pelham, and Ashbourne, of course. Oh, Clave, Pelham, and Ashbourne. Yeah. Part of the time they had a gun on me, threatening me. Then, Pelham, the ringleader, demanded the blotter. Not knowing of the hole in my lining I was sure I didn't have it, thinking you'd stolen it, see? When she pulled that blotter out, I nearly dropped dead. Maisie, darling. Forgive me, honey. I didn't understand how things were with you. - Here, sit down. - Gee, me forgive you? I thought you were one of them. But you don't suspect me now, do you, Maisie? - I'm on your side. - I know you're on my side now. Well, honey, they won't bother you anymore. Flip won't let the bad people hurt you. He'll take care of you. He'll get you another blotter too. Flip, don't you believe me? Sure, I know how very real it was to you, darling. You saw them and you heard them. But Flip's gonna help you now. There's a wonderful guy here in this hotel who'll understand the whole thing. Well, would he believe me without any proof? Sure, he will. He's got an office right downstairs. You'll be crazy about.. I mean, you'll like him, Maisie. - Dr. Cummings. Joe Cummings. - A doctor? What good would he do? I need somebody that'll help me hold Gloria Fullerton in some secret place till she comes around to our way of thinking. But now, honey, Clave and Pelham and Ashbourne are the bad ones. But you like Mrs. Fullerton. - Why would you wanna hurt her? - I don't wanna hurt her! I wanna hold her back till her husband gets here. I know. You just tell Dr. Cummings everything. He'll straighten you all out. Flip, are you intimating again that I'm a little nutsy? No, honey, of course not. You've just been working too hard. After you've had a good rest and plenty of sun and lots of nourishing food, you'll be fine. Yeah, while I'm getting sun and nourishment Gloria's getting gypped and divorced. You just leave all those things to Flip. Maybe, I can get the doctor tonight. - Not tonight. - But you'll like Dr. Cummings. I'll like it better in the morning. [phone ringing] Uh, just a minute. [Flip] 'Alright, in the morning. Promise?' Yeah, I promise, and thanks for everything, Flip. I don't know what I'd do without you. But I will. [door shuts] Okay, George. Now, Mrs. Fullerton comes up the courthouse steps. - Yeah. Front steps marked A. - Right. [Maisie] Then, she goes through the front door. Front door B. And there'll be crowds milling around and flashbulbs exploding. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. Now, right about here, make that C.. ...you step up to her and you say-- I say it like a court attendant. "Mrs. Fullerton, kindly follow me. Case will be heard in the annex to avoid crowds." That's right. And from then on, it's boom! boom! boom! Bang! Zist, boom, bang! You're out! And then boom, you cut her up. And it's zing, zing, zing, zowie, and we're in. Then you gun her up again. And it's.. ...slam! Bang! 40, 50, 60, skiddley-ruff-ka-doo. And it's over. - Oh, Joseph. - 'Yes, sir.' While we're in court, deliver these to real estate office. Return at once. The hearing won't be long. We'll go right to the airport. Yes, sir. - I can't go through with it. - It won't be too difficult. Just a few questions. Mr. Hues has gone over it with you. You only have to say yes and it will be over in a few minutes. But all those people. I have to walk those courthouse steps through that mob. I just can't do it. If I never get my divorce, I can't. But Gloria.. None of that will be necessary. I can fix it. There'll be no courthouse steps, no crowds. - Joseph. - 'Yes, sir.' Get the station wagon. [indistinct chatter] [chattering continues] Let us pass, please. Mrs. Fullerton, give us a picture without the veil. - Will you please? - No photos. Absolutely not. - But Mr. Pelham we are-- - Stand back and let 'em pass. Mrs. kindly... oh, I mean, Mrs. Fullerton. Kindly follow me, your case will be heard in the annex in order to avoid the crowds. Oh, Mr. Pelham will be escorted there also. I must get to the side door. Oh, that's right, to the side door. That's just where we're going, Mrs. Fullerton. Right this way. [indistinct chatter] Keep quiet. Here you are, Jerry. Into the car, Mrs. Fullerton. Any resistance is useless. Go on. [screaming] Keep quiet. Jerry, it's not her, it's Wini. Gee, what do we do now? I don't know. Get in while I think. [muffled talking] [rattling] [muffled talking] - 'Oh, keep quiet.' - Oh, I beg your pardon. That's her. Get her. I can't get this door open. Could you help me? - Right in here. - Yes, but I.. [Gloria] 'Help!' Start her up. I'm taking this off so you can chirp and save us trouble. You little meddler. - Where are you taking us? - To a nice quiet spot. Step on it, Jerry. Mr. Pelham will follow us with the police. - I advise you to turn back. - I don't think so. Your pal, Mr. Pelham's kind of anxious to stay away from the cops, isn't he, Wini? You'll get what's coming to you. Oh, now, now, Winnie-the-Pew.. [door rattling] It's a frame-up all the way. Can't you see it? She's crazy, Gloria. Her actions prove it. [tire hissing] Jerry! We're alright now, Miss Ravier. Here come the cops. Oh, yeah. Just dandy. Help, police! - Help! - Help! - Please. - Please stop. - Over here. - Help! - Help. - Help. What's the matter? Don't tell me one of you is having a baby. It's kidnapping, officer. - She forced us with a gun. - Not true. I haven't got a gun. - She's doing her duty, officer. - She's a dangerous criminal. Trying to keep Mrs. Fullerton from her divorce. I'm due in the courthouse at Reno. - Wait a minute. Let-- - The girl's out of her mind. It's the only explanation for kidnapping us. Listen, I'm the one that's being kidnapped. I'm in the middle. She pulled a gun on me. Just look under her purse. She planted that on me. A likely story, a very likely story. I demand to be taken back to the courthouse now. Quiet. [indistinct chatter] Quiet! You're all pinched. You can explain it at the headquarters. I'm afraid, I'll have to agree with Miss Ashbourne, captain. The poor girl must be mentally unbalanced. - Anyone can see she's cracked. - She is not! What do you know about this, son? Uh, nothing. He had absolutely nothing to do with it. [Captain] 'I'm asking him.' You can beat me with stool pigeons. My lips are sealed. You better tell the truth, son. What should I do? Tell the truth. We have nothing to hide. Alright, Miss Ravier is a secret operator for the FBI. What's this? Oh, well, not exactly, Your Highness. I mean, Your Honor. You see-- You're not. Oh, Miss Ravier.. - Well, Jerry-- - But she told me. There you are! I'll tell you she's insane. Well, I'm no more nuts than you are, captain. Alright, son. You can go. We'll call if we want you. Thanks. Miss Ravier, I have only this to say. I'll never trust another woman as long as I live. Oh, uh, captain, do we need to wait? Our main consideration is Mrs. Fullerton's divorce. Under the circumstances, Judge Carter has consented to hear her case in his private chambers immediately. I'm sorry, but I can't let you go until this is settled. Now, you accused this girl of kidnapping. - She accuses you-- - But she's crazy. Can't you see that? If that's proved, I'll hold her and discharge the rest of you. - Fair enough, major. - Captain. Well, I promoted you. That'll do you no good. I'm a married man. - 'Maisie!' - Flip! Oh, honey, I'm glad you are here. They're trying to tell the captain I'm crazy. Alright, darling, take it easy. I've brought Dr. Cummings along. Dr. Cummings? Captain, I'm Flip Hennahan. This is Dr. Cummings. I'd like to know the charge against Miss Ravier. We have several. Kidnapping, mental deficiency. And assault with a deadly weapon. It is not a deadly weapon. It won't even shoot beans. That man's the blackjack dealer at the hotel. There're evidently accomplices. We are not. We're hardly speaking. Keep out. Let me handle it. I'll take care of you. But I don't need taking care of. Just tell them I'm as sane as.. What's he looking at? Well, he's a psychiatrist, dear. I don't care if he's Arabian, he can't stare like I was a steak. 'We're wasting time, doc.' What about this girl? Is she alright upstairs or isn't she? It's difficult to say without a complete examination. I see traces of an afronike displacement. - What's that crack?-- - The doctor's here to help you. But I don't need a doctor. There's nothing wrong with me. He's just gummin' up things. Captain, Miss Ravier's been overactive in war work. She came here to rest. She's nervous and tired. Poor kid. Hey, doc, does this kind ever get violent? That's possible. Possible? Oh, I, I didn't mean it. She's in a highly nervous state. I tell you, she's not responsible for what she says. - That's possible. - Thanks, doc. - Flip. - 'Captain.' - Surely, you're satisfied now. - Yeah, I've heard enough. You folks can go. But don't leave the courthouse, in case I want you. Thank you, captain. Come along, Gloria. Don't be too hard on her, captain. I'm sure she didn't mean to harm us. I'm sorry, my dear. Oh, Mrs. Fullerton, you're making a terrible mistake. - They're pulling a fast one. - Come along, Gloria. - Mrs. Fullerton.. - Hold it. Take it easy. You take your hands off me. I would've been alright if you hadn't come here. They'll beat my knees and tell me I'm in love with a spoon. The excitement's too much for her. I'll take her back to rest. Nothing doing. I'll have to hold her till tomorrow morning so the state alienist can check her. No, you can't do that. You'll spoil everything. - I gotta be at the courthouse. - 'Put her in the cage.' A night at the police station is not gonna help her condition. - No! No! - 'Put her in 26, Joe.' No! Oh, oh! Here get a chair, hurry. [groaning] [groaning continues] What happened to her, doc? Oh.. - Where am I? - You're with Flip, honey. Oh...was it a spell? I'm afraid so, honey. But don't worry. - The doctor's right here. - Oh. Am I alright now, doctor? No, dear. That's the doctor. Doctor. Oh, doctor, afronike? Gee, I haven't had one of these since I was nine years old. Tell me were any members of your family dementia praecox? Oh, well, Grandma was sort of dementia. But Grandpa was more the praecox type. [giggling] Perhaps, if this lady could be put in a hospital, captain-- A hospital. That's it. Maybe, if I rest for a couple of days I'd be alright again.. ...for years. Put her in my care. I'll be responsible for her. Well, alright. Remember she still has charges against her. She won't run away. I'll be with her. - Go ahead. - Come on, darling. - Oh. - Lean on Flip, honey. Bad luck to step on a crack. As soon as you feel better, we'll take a trip. So that you can get good and strong. - That will be wonderful, Flip. - Sure it will. Wait here with him while I get a taxi. Okay. [Maisie] Bill! Bill! [dramatic music] Bill. Get me back to the courthouse. Come on. [dramatic music] Come on, doctor. Why'd you let her get away? 'She's crazy!' [indistinct chatter] 'Stop her!' [music continues] - Now.. - What's the meaning of this? - That pest again. - Bill. You haven't got time for that. Lock the other door. [dramatic music] Maisie, open the door. Now, we girls can talk this over nice and quiet. - 'Maisie!' - Maybe, not quiet, but quick. I'll settle this. Skiddle-de-ruff, Bill. What are you trying to prove? It's my word and Bill's against them. But you gotta listen. They proved she was crazy. Don't listen to her, Gloria. Shut up. They forged those letters so they can split you and get the money. Maisie! Maisie open the door. - What's going on? - There's a maniac in there. - So you feel positive-- - 'Maisie, open the door.' Reconciliation is out of the question. - Yes, Your Honor. - 'Maisie, open the door!' [Flip] 'Maisie, open the door!' There'll be a five minute recess. Open this door. That's the truth, the whole truth. Take it or leave it. You believe one word, you're crazy as she is. Even if I am crazy, Bill ain't. - Did you know about this? - Not until Maisie dug it up. Oh, Bill. [Judge] 'Open this door.' Oh, yeah. I think the Judge wants in. [people chattering] [officer #1] 'Quiet!' - Quiet, please. - Quiet! Silence! May I ask what in the.. What's going on in here? Your honor, your honor Miss Ravier was placed in my charge. She got away, but she's not responsible. Tell him, Gloria. Gloria? I'm Gloria Fullerton, Judge Carter. And this is my husband. This young lady saved us from divorce and embezzlement. - Is that right, soldier? - That's right, Your Honor. I demand the arrest of those two for conspiracy and grand larceny. - Why, she's crazy. - Your Honor, this is absurd. The ravings of a mad women. You can pick up a forger called Clave at the El Presidente Hotel. He's in with 'em too. [indistinct chatter] Hold that man! [indistinct chatter] Phew, I never felt more like a sardine. You come here. We've got more than sardines to talk about. - Look, Maisie, tell me-- - Now, listen, you big lug. This is all your fault. You and your old psychic analysis. Alright, honey, I give in. I guess, maybe, I'm the one who should've had the doctor. Honey, you don't need a doctor. Pardon me. [orchestral music]
