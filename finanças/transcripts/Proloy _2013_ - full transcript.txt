Was there anything in the newspapers today? Don't know about Kolkata but... there was a small story in today's local newspaper. I don't think I can do it.- - Same here. But the money? Don't be scared. They're coming. Get ready. Get the evening newspaper from Robi da's shop. Okay. Should I come along.- - Sure. I'll be back.- - Go. I'll go get the bike out from the stand. Listen...- - Yes. I owe Robi da some money. Clear the due. Heard me?- - Yes. Master da.- - Yes. Yes, tell me. What the...- - Run! Kingshuk! Not my area. My area is till this side of the dam. That side is under Dulanpur.- - I know sir. But those boys came from this side, near Bhogibaba's abode... and said such nasty things to my daughter...- Bhogibaba's abode isn't under my police station. Go to some other police station. Okay? Bhogibaba's abode isn't under our area! How many times do I tell you we can't take the case. Go. What do I do then sir? Mine is a Government job. Can't do illegal things. Right? Go to some other police station. Go now. This side of the dam is our area. There's a black goat tied there, its left leg is in our area. Got it? It happened on the same side of the goat. Please do something sir. It was Mr. Ray's birthday yesterday. We cut up that goat for the feast. Now tell me... the goat itself isn't there, how to tell which side it was? They have all teamed up to stop us. Why? Because we're thinking about your development. The fact that you're happy, healthy and in peace... they don't like it. But for your development... we must win. Hence, in the upcoming election make us victorious by voting on the Lantern logo. Got it? Proshanto. We shall love, we shall light, light the lantern, light the lantern! We shall love, we shall light, light the lantern, light the lantern! We shall love, we shall light, light the lantern, light the lantern! Don't you dare touch my beer! Don't touch my beer! Nice! Take her aside. I need to feel a little light. Leave me! Let me go! Hey! I'll butcher you if you begin before me! Make it fast! Get up you rascal! Get up! Why did you begin before me? Now hold her legs! No! No please! See, I wasn't there on spot. But I'm a leader. I understand everything. Bhai must've said something naughty, he's just a kid. Got it? A kid saying naughty things doesn't get a girl to a hospital. He pulled aside my daughter from the road... Hey Proshanto, What did you do with his daughter? I? I didn't do anything. I don't know anything. Correct! He doesn't know anything. My brother respects women a lot. He can't do anything.- - So what Haren says is wrong? And what his daughter says is wrong too. Not wrong. A mistake. She must have taken things in a wrong way. Forget it. Honey, please come here. His wife.- - Bless me God! Go make me a hot cup of tea. Go. If he has such a sweet wife at home why would he grab at a road side girl and get stained? Right?- - See Mr. Ashim... we've come to you for justice or else the villagers would've hammered and buried them into the ground! You rascal! Control brother. What did you say? Bury my brother? Bury him then. Bury him here he'll come up inside your home. He is an undying monster! Got it? Now come on get lost! Sixty three new religions.- - Moyna, eat now. Enough studying. Let me finish this. Master da will be here anytime now. You? What are you doing here? Told you I'll come. Came up your home. Get out at once! Too brave aren't you? A prescription for the over smart doctor! Why study? It is better you sleep around! And whenever you dare, remember this rape; and if you open your mouth, I'll rape you once again! You must practice to remember it! Now come on hold him!- - Leave my father! Try touching her once! I'll cut you into two pieces! Cut me into pieces, will you? No! Let her go please!- - Hey! Haven't I told you not to begin before me? There's hot food inside, go eat. Surekha is not out of danger. They're not letting the news out. At Jaidighi near Dulanpur another mother and daughter... How is Moyna now? None of them are well Barun da. What will happen? That is the question.- - Hey! How can you keep your cool? Feel like thrashing their heads! How will that help?- - As in? An eye for an eye will make the entire nation blind. We've to walk a different path. We can take up arms anytime. But there's no stopping once we do it. Oh please! Do whatever you want! Master, how much more can we endure? Till now they were doing smuggling and politics. Now they are getting into our houses. We need a proper revolt now! Revolution has many languages Nikhil. One, violence. That animals believe in. And two, non-violence. Beholding the truth through non-violence. That humans believe in. And they're believing you so much! Listen... This is not Kolkata, where you teach, this is a village. You can't give in to the goons here. Only violence speaks here. Do we change our belief system because of what others believe? Anyone can revolt through violence! But why should we? We shall stand against their violence and look right in their eye! And for that kind of a revolution we need a platform. A platform we will ourselves built! We will call it, 'Platform of Awakening!' Get up! Wake up! Realise what you deserve! And make others realise too. A calm... but stubborn revolution! But none of them are well Barun da. Surekha, Moyna... None of us are doing well, Durga. Right? But this is not the time to shed tears. This is the time to make fire out of those tears! We need to revolt, need to fight. But that, in our own way. Come on! How sad! But what do I do brother? My hands are tied up. Strange! Earlier all reports from that area were filed here. Mr. Ashim, the minister. He has passed a new law. According to that, those areas aren't under my police station. But who can inquire, right? Go to another police station. How sad. Thank you. Let's go. Told you the area isn't under our police station. Now go! Tell us where to go. We're suffering because we're stuck the middle. You can clearly see she is in much pain. But what do I do? But if you want, could take that area under my police station. Aren't you ashamed? You can't help us anyway, now you're insulting women? When did I insult you? Fine, if you don't like it then... leave. Let's go. I understand everything but nothing can happen today. Today is the Foundation Day of the police station. We're always dealing with criminals. So a get together today... a little fun, frolic and merry making you see. Yes do that. That is what the Government is paying you for. Hey! Don't think you've bought us because we're keeping mum. Lock you up and you'll know why we get paid. Let me say something sir. You've got women at home too. They use the same village roads. They're animals sir. When they attack they don't think if it a rickshaw puller's daughter or a police officer's. Look, you seem intelligent. But even if it has happened we can't arrest anyone. Because the crime spot- - Isn't under you? Yes, right Ray?- - Intelligent boy sir. And who have you accused? Proshanto Mondol? Oh him! He is not under any police station. Who has complained against me? Barun Biswas. I'll finish you, you swine! You think you alone can do that? Threatening me? There is a different prescription for threats. Different prescription for women, love them a lot! It is different for men too. I'll finish you... Hey! When we left home to file the complaint, we were prepared for your reaction. Now we need to see which one is stronger. Your wrath or our endurability. I'll thrash away your endurability in no time! Mind your language! Holy Cow! Little Miss Muffet! Why in public, come to my room to teach me the language! Speak another word and I'll tear off your tongue! You speak a word and I'll tear off your clothes you bitch! Dada! Please leave it. I'll have to hear for this. Police station after all. I realise you all are believers in physical strength and all that. We don't. We believe in the will power. Let's see who wins. Hey! I'll kill him! No one comes forward! No one! Gave you a sample of the physical strength. Accepted. Will give you the sample of will power some other time. Come on. Continue with the rehearsal. Bye. Let's go. Respected District Magistrate, Nikhil, drop the letter on the way to College Street tomorrow. Send it through GPO, it'll go faster. What do you think Master? This letter will work? Earlier too you've sent letters. Any response? The change will happen. Tomorrow, if not today. If we lose hope like this, nothing can happen ever. Nothing will ever happen. Mark my words, they'll get the letter and tear it down. It is better we go tear those monsters down! Which problem will it solve? Anger can solve no problems. Like Dada, I too don't support your ways Master. You endured his slap, then you'll endure his punches. They will smash you to the ground, endure that too? He will!- - How long like this? Won't we ever be able to solve any problem? No Durga, Master is right. It is light that tears the darkness apart. And one day this darkness shall disappear for sure! Wait! What did you say? Light tears the darkness apart? Doesn't it?- - Of course it does! Sure! And this light shall be our weapon to cut through the dark. Bye. See you at the temple tomorrow. Nikhil, drop the letter. Hey!- - Err.. what now? Do it then. You? Everyone's left, why haven't you? I will. Another letter? Like Kingshuk said, the light tears the dark away. That's what'll will happen here. But we should worry about punishing them first Barun da. Is there a need to bring light right now for that? Of course! Always keep one thing in mind. A pen is always mightier than the sword. Where nothing else works, a pen does. Think about it. Wherever we went with our problems they did nothing, sat still like statues. If light comes to our village, people will rethink. They are bound to take us more seriously. Do you get it? Listen, understand. Only us thinking about it won't do. We need the villagers to start thinking too. If light comes here, people will get some courage. Light will be our first step to a revolution! Once electricity comes, people will know, a little effort can work wonders. It does not need a minister. All it needs is a human being's genuine effort. But I worry for you, Barun da.- - Why worry? They're not good people, they can harm you. You can't afford to worry if you're doing something big. I don't worry about myself at all. But I do. Don't worry. Just be with me. That's enough. Come along everybody Come, let's learn to fly A silver clad day has arrived So many hues shower into the lap of the night All of them splurging around! Smiles spread across faces Like hopes awaken in hearts Go run! And sing aloud! Today, everyone's clad in light at every corner In the dream land enlightenment has come Spreading happiness to nooks and corners of all hearts Such joy has never bloomed till today The heart lives again, all disease is washed away Those that reside on the tree of wishes They too are slowly, coming close. It is you, love breathes around The night and day merge like these two lives That piece of crap! Dada... I will shove it up his...- - Shut up! Who are you?- - Let me introduce. Mr. Shukumar. The Party's district head. Take his blessings.- - Oh! Proshanto. Very active chap. He's so busy in the area, doesn't have time to visit you. Anyway, Panchayat Election is coming up. Improve public relations. Reach out to people. I am superb at reaching out to people. He has even reached the bedrooms of the villagers. Got it? Great! He is a useful lad! Weren't you speaking about some piece of crap? Here it is, come. Give him some snacks. Snacks from Kanai's shop. Gods come down to have it too. Please take. Make it with potatoes or tomatoes. I love snacks. Go inside honey.- - Go in! Beautiful! Electricity has come into the village! Yes, all because of him. He went to Kolkata and nailed it under DBC party! When did I do it?- - Crow never eats crow meat. Never hide anything from your own clan. I've not popped out of nowhere today. Okay? I have all the news. Correct news. Switch off all the lights before Panchayat Election. Our bikes will arrive and take care of the problem. And what were you saying?- - Tell him. There's a bast... err rascal in our village. Barun Biswas? Works at the Mitra Institution in Kolkata. Teaches there. Good, we've always wanted to educate people. That's our motto, right? I know that. So?- - What you don't know is... Barun comes back home in the 8:30pm train everyday. So? Crowded train. If someone pushes him from behind... and he falls, what will people call it? Murder? Or accident? Good morning Sir. Very good morning, sit. I asked you to read about Tagore's life... before I started teaching 'Mrityunjoy'. How many of you did that? Knew it. I trust you guys. Why sir? Because you guys are honest. Sit. Look... anyone can answer the regular questions after reading the story. It is there in the book itself. But where did the story take birth? Under which situations and experiences...- Oh, good morning sir. Morning! Sit down my son! Derozio! How are you?- - Good sir. There is a meeting in the evening. Syllabus is changing. We need to see how important this change is for the kids. Please be there.- - Sure. Oh yes, what news there? Have the scoundrels been arrested? Not yet. But I am not giving up. I can see that in the fire in your eyes. You know Barun... my roots too are in the village. When you brought light there... I felt so happy! Felt like my roots got stronger. Sometimes I wonder, what if even I could do it. Sure sir, why wouldn't you be able to? Can everyone be Barun Biswas? Get back to the battle with your Bengal Regiment. I'll go to my class.- - Yes sir. See you in the meeting.- - Sure. Yes, where was I? Rabindranath Tagore. Rabindranath and his life's philosophy. Please move a bit.- - How much more? - Hey, Barun... - Yes... Come sit on my seat. Come sit on my seat. I'm fine here. Please sit. Told you Barun da will be late, go home. Come on.- - Yes, I'll tell you when he comes. My daughter is very ill. Master said he'll give money today. Please let me meet him once. I've to buy quite a few books. Master da asked me to come today. Please let me see him.- - My house fell day before. Dada said he'll give money. Please let me meet him. Who Dada? I am his big brother. I'll tell Barun when he comes. Make it fast. He'll come with the salary, it'll be over in no time. Please go.- - Yes, when Barun... You guys are here? Sorry, got a bit late. Ajit uncle, go to Kolkata and get her check up done. Okay? Okay.- - Ashish... Here, for your books. And you buy bats and balls with this... I'll make you do ten rounds of the field at dawn. Remember. What is all this! Please! Gouri. Go rebuild your house. Alright? What is wrong with you guys! Your school fee was pending right? Here. Oh God! This is incorrigible! You must reopen your shop. Okay? Keep this. Uncle. Your theatre group should not close. Okay? You, buy the medicines and give it your wife on time. And please don't fall at my feet! Okay? Everyone happy? May god bless you!- - May God bless everyone. Go home. For the monthly grocery? Dada, I think you've to go beg at station from the next month. Or else forget monthly, there won't be money for the weekly. Don't try to be over smart now. No. No one else can. Only you will. Telling you again, these people will forget you one day. I'm telling you again too, no worries when my brother is here! Please take my bag.- - Why will you be worried? Everyone else will worry, about you. I'm worried for you. Why here till so late? Go home! Won't. I'll stay here tonight. At your place. No food for dinner. You know our situation. Won't eat. But I'll stay here. Think you've grown up now huh? Go home! Hey wait. Don't go alone. Come I'll drop you. Come on! Be safe.- - You stay safe too. Hold her tight!- - Let me go! Hey! What's happening huh? Please come out. What happened?- - I was going home. These boys pulled me here. Where do you stay? In this village, Subodh Mullick's daughter. Come with me, I'll drop you. Baba! What's wrong dear?- - They're coming again! Who?- - They! Where? Can you hear it? Your Master da's bike's sound. Now feel safe? Sleep. Come on, sleep. Sleep. Hey! What's happening here? Get lost! Fine! We'll find you later! Don't be scared. Don't worry. I'm there! I'll roam the village roads every night now onwards. Be with your family. I'll get the doctor. Okay? Go in. Where's Barun da?- - In his room. In his room?- - Sleeping. Still sleeping? Worked as a security guard last night. Guarding the village. I can't take all this anymore! See what you can do. Didn't sleep?- - Tried to but... then thought of writing this letter, so writing it. What letter? I'm writing a letter to the newspapers, against these crimes. We have to find a solution. But you'll fall ill if you stay up all night like this. Doesn't matter. We'll stay up with you too. I'll bring you food. I'm I going for a picnic? You said we all must stick together. Cut this crap. Go in and see if there is anything to eat. I'm hungry, didn't eat last night. I'll finish the letter by then. Here. If you want anything else, I'll make it. Not needed. Have you eaten? Eaten?- - Yes. Haven't I asked you not to lie for no reason? Open your mouth. Make it bigger. I have something for you. Take this. Read it. Listen, finish the rest, I'll leave. Very hard. The book. It is not the book that's hard. It is hard to understand you. The nature is with me, it's time to make my wishes come true My eyes are cloud cast, a subtle sweet pain lingers away Oh, the keeper of my heart, My heart has given me the hint Tell me why the sky is so colourful today? Wherever I set foot, I leave no shadows behind I shy away from stepping ahead, my lips are sealed. Oh river what if he comes and stands before me... I bosom my heart, but for how long? The bird of my heart, flies away for no reason Oh, the bird of my heart what do I name him? Turned into Matangini Hajra being with Barun. Processions and parades in the local roads. Nice. I'll shove all your revolution up! Today we start the ribbon cutting ceremony. We begin with you. With that lovely waist line, should you be threatening me? A threats prescription: A riverside injection! Come on. Oh no! Durga! Doctor! Who's there? What's the fuss?- - Need to admit a patient. Which room?- - Admit? What happened? Oh God! Don't worry, tell us the room, we'll take her. Many rooms are there. But we need the Panchayat's letter. What letter?- - Admission letter. Need a letter and money.- - The girl's lying in front of you. You're talking about money? Are you human? No, an animal!- - Is that so? Then we must treat you like one. Bhai, leave him! Don't lose your cool! What's all this! This is a hospital! We know it, he doesn't! The girl's dying. He's waiting for a letter! Let me see. No letters needed. Bring her. I'll see you later. Nikhil come! You son of a gun!- - I'm not here to fight! Could've got the entire village to destroy everything here! But I've come alone. And only to tell you that... that's enough. No more!! Time and again given you chances to correct yourself. Asked you to surrender. Nothing happened. Told the village, the police and now telling you standing here, I'll put all of you into the jail within the next forty-eight hours! Stop me if you can. Platform of Awakening. Platform of Awakening. Give it to me. How much? Not now please. Please take this. Just have a look. My name is Barun Biswas. A member of the Platform of Awakening. Please read this. Please! Don't need to look, just keep your ears open. And listen carefully. All of you know that in the past few days... thirty women have been raped in our village. Those monsters have exhausted our efforts to report or complain. Their oppression has only increased. But how long? How long shall we endure? We know the police won't do anything. Those ministers are sitting on their head. It is those ministers who are petting these dogs. But if those dogs come out and bite humans... then their owner must pay, and the dogs must be punished. Whether the dogs be insane or not! They can hit us once, twice. Thrice. May be we'll fall. But the fourth time... we'll learn. We'll stand up and revolt! We shall stand up! On behalf of the Platform of Awakening committee I demand.. The arrest of Ronojit Koley, Haran Sardar, Shekhar Mallik Makhan Gayen right now, including their leader, Proshanto Mondol! Hey! Will you shut up! I'll cut you into millions of pieces! Even your family won't...- - Only us or I won't do! You all will have to raise you voices with us. Or else there is no end to this darkness! Open your ears and listen, maybe you all will buy your daily groceries and go home then eat and sleep. But when you open your eyes... you may see these same monsters attacking your homes, your women, like beasts! Don't know about you all, but in my village, in my home I won't tolerate dirty dogs. I Barun Biswas, demand their arrest again from this platform. These dogs, these beasts should be arrested right away! Now is the time So I sing you this wake-up call The horizon calls out to you for the search of a new direction Your tears dried up at the corner of your eye, mother But no more! It's time to wipe away those tears A rebellious wind unsettles the numb waters and caresses her with affection A new wave has risen at a sleepy harbor on this wintry, morning of slumber a footstep is heard, Someone has arrived Here, keep this book. Golden words of Ramkrishna. Read it in the jail. Will help. Hold it. Take him sir. Come on, get them. Sir, so late at night?- - Get out! Out! Okay sir.- - Bhai! Bhai? Now you've found time to come? I was busy running around for you, got it? And what have you got now? Orders from above. Or they couldn't have picked you up. And the main fellow behind all this is that new in charge. Jayanta Chakraborty.- - That son of a... Don't worry. I've taken care of Jayanta Chakraborty. They'll pick him up. Give me my thing.- - Thing? Oh. He got me into the lock-up! He is too brave isn't he? I'll shove up all that bravery, my name is Proshanto Mondol! Only seen me hiss, not seen the poison! Comes back home in the local train at 8:30pm. Won't anymore. Son, are you there? Son, you there? Here. Tuni got back from the hospital today. I can never pay you back for what you did. Your aunt says, I can never give you money for your help. She sent some sweets. Great! Put it in the bag please.- - Sure. The entire village is talking about what you did! It was only my duty. Now go on. Yes. Master da. Sit here.- - No, you sit. Pradip, you did not give me the list of books. Why do you help them? You bring them books. And they loiter cinema halls. But Ashu uncle, your men too haven't reached yet. I've made all preparations. They'll come. We're indebted to you for all that you do. Chuck that. Do one thing... no, actually don't bother. I'll send Nikhil with everything. Okay?- - Fine. What? What happened?- - You won't change. There is no need to change. Go on then. Was there anything in the newspapers today? Don't know about Kolkata but... there was a small story in today's local newspaper. I don't think I can do it.- - Same here. But the money? Don't be scared. They're coming. Get ready. Get the evening newspaper from Robi da's shop. Okay. Should I come along.- - Sure. I'll be back.- - Go. I'll go get the bike out from the stand. Listen...- - Yes. I owe Robi da some money. Clear the due. Heard me?- - Yes. Master da.- - Yes. Yes, tell me. What the...- - Run! Master! Kingshuk! Master! What happened! Please help someone! Please! I'm your Barun. Please get me to a... hospital... No more worries! Now is the time So I sing you this wake-up call The horizon calls out to you for the search of a new direction Master! FEW DAYS LATER... Looking for someone? Need a van? Where to?- - Dukhiya. Barun Biswas's place. You? Barun and I used to teach in the same school. Namaskar!- - Namaskar! Come. Why did Barun have to die? Honey. Surekha. Come out dear. Come. My daughter, Surekha. Weren't you asking why Master had to die? This too is a reason. Can you see? What they did with my little girl! They don't leave mothers too. Meeting for Barun da's death. Then to the police station. Kingshuk will take you. You will come too. And... Master's friend from the school, he's come from Kolkata. Durga? Yes. Come if you can. Who did we lose? Barun da? The same man who's an idol to our village's young generation? Never supported violence, nor took up a gun or became a leader. He loved the pen over the gun. He'd say, "Durga... there is nothing mightier than the pen." And those who killed this man aren't punished even today! When he died I thought, we could no more do anything about those beasts. And what could we do? Then I remembered something he had told me. He would often tell me, "Not the time to shed tears, Durga." "This is the time to make fire out of the tears. There is much more you women, can do, that we men can't." Barun da taught us Swami Vivekananda's teachings. Get up. Wake up. Realise what you deserve. Only if we stand up shall the criminals be punished. We won't back out from getting beaten up or from revolting. Are you with us?- - Yes! We are all there! We will all be there! Punish the killers of Barun Biswas right away! Right now! Right now! Ray! Hey Ray! See what's happening! The police will have to punish! Stop them! The police will have to punish! Yes, okay, fine! Handle this. I'll be back. Please calm down! Barun Biswas, we won't forget you! This is the press where we stayed up to print the leaflets. The memories are still fresh, I still feel weird! Barun would sit here. He wouldn't let anyone speak. He would go on speaking. Ajit uncle's daughter isn't improving, we've to take her to Kolkata. That would need two thousand, have to buy Pradip's books too. Another thousand for that. Durga, do one thing... tell everyone I'll get my salary in 4 days. Then I'll take care of it. This village had become a pit of anarchy! Barun started prowling the village roads at night. Took up the responsibility for all the houses. People would feel safe with the sound of his bike and sleep. They knew, whatever happened Barun Biswas, was there. But Barun's murderers are sleeping in peace right now. The public has a very bad memory sir. Today they're talking about Barun Biswas. A film-star comes tomorrow, Barun Biswas will find no place. Whatever is the flavor of the season. Barun! How are you? Good sir. And you? Not good. Do you think the people you worked so hard for, they'll pay back? A nation is known by its citizens. A civilization by it's humanity. And a society by it's?- - People. Not by the hypocrites. Exactly. Barun... I want to be like you! Like you! Bye sir. They're free again. Right sir? Sir, won't they ever be punished? What they did to me and other village women, to Barun da... all those criminals will never be punished? Tears are for the coward. Not for brave women like you, Durga. Your Barun did not teach you to cry. He has taught you to fight. So, don't be scared. Do not shed tears. Always remember... Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high Where knowledge is free, where the world has not been broken up into fragments Please listen! Barun... Barun Biswas. He, who stood here one day asking you to revolt. To unite! Do you remember that Barun Biswas is no more today? But those, who's oppressions he revolted against, those, who killed him, they have not been punished! They're celebrating their freedom with colours and music! Barun, who remained worried for you all his life... Who's that? Don't you want his killers to be punished? Hey move aside! He wanted our well- being, won't you revolt? Come, let's go to the police. Let's build another revolt! Oppression in every village loss of dignity of the women won't all this get justice? Those criminals are now... You bloody moron... Barun's dad is dead. Who on earth are you? His illegitimate father are you? Take my hand. Get up! Here. Take a breather. Only the first round. No point looking. You don't know this infamous face. The poet said, 'He will FIT it all'. I use an 'H' instead. He will Hit it all. Let's go.- - Where? To hit... it at the right place? I believe in two things, a hard punch and a hard kick. Come. What nonsense! He peed on your face, that's the complaint? You're kidding here?- - No, I'm just surprised! This is such a silly thing! And the market area isn't ours. Explain to him. I? Okay. Told you that market area isn't under our police station. Want me to hang a board? Under who is it then? Err... Dulanpur. Dulanpur said it is not under them. Laudiha station then.- - Laudiha? Laudiha? Okay. Let's go. He pushed me to the ground and peed on me! And why did you have to give that lecture? Besides, market is not our area. Everyone is saying the same thing. Who is it under then? The market? It is under Proshanto and Ashim Mondol. Proshanto Mondol did this. And it is under him? Now that you're shouting his name, do you know who he is? Who is he? Who is this Proshanto Mondol? Manmohan Singh or Vivekananda? Hey you! Acting smart? Will thrash you to dirt! You son of a gun! Listen! Animesh Dutta. Special Branch. Sir! They keep tossing the ball! Blood!- - Wrap up the furnitures. Set it under the tree between all three police stations. That'll be the police station and this, a beauty parlour. Facials and all that! I'm in charge of the village and the 3 officers under me. And print this in your mind, if you act over smart... will grind you to dirt! Don't give me that look Grandpa! Treat them any better and they'll sit on your head. Come along Grandpa, they won't feed you snacks. Yes, tell me the problems. Come. They want to make a Party office in my land. Threatening me if I refuse! Even insulting my family!- - Is this a problem? If it happens again, give one tight slap and then tell me. Hello Mr.Bachhan! Where you off to so early? To Kolkata. She is going to the lawyer and I'm going to the media. Wait and watch, I'll shaken the media again! They'll be arrested and punished again! I'll introduce.- - Yes! She's Durga. And he is... Animesh Dutta. Special Branch.- - Special Branch? Yes.- - Answer one question of mine. Sure! Proshanto, Haran, Ronojit, Makhon, will they ever be punished? Please come with me. You too, please. Come. Please stand here and I'll sit. Concentrate. This is West Bengal, this is me. This is Proshanto going to Delhi as Member of Assembly. This is my wife cooking at home, this is me getting a transfer. And this is my wife, not at my home, at Andaman now. So I have been transferred to Andaman. A jumbled up situation! Let's go. The demon slayer, Durga! Why didn't I come here earlier? What were you saying?- - About Barun Biswas...- The Minister's daughter is getting married today. Loads of guests! We're media partners. I promise this will happen later. Check it and send it. You're still here? Barun Biswas...- - Told you... Barun Biswas won't sell well right now. Sell?- - I did it when it sold. Another emotional...- - This isn't emotional? Yes, but very old. Give me new news. I promise to do it. Samar, I'm doing the minister's story. No Sir, not possible right now. And who knows him? Those who did, have forgotten him. Not possible. But if you arrange something, I could arrange too. Arrange?- - Nothing comes free, you see. Give me something, I'll see what I can give you. It is all give and take today. I get it but how will the common man relate to him? But Barun was one of them, he spoke for them. Doesn't matter what he spoke off. Did any political leader or a celebrity speak about his death? Then... a social activist?- - No. In that case, what can we do sir? You could go to the village and ask around... Yes, we can do that, do one thing, get hold of a leader.. Or a celebrity to support your issue, then we can do it. Otherwise the news will not be salable you know? Sorry. Excuse me. Salable? What are you looking for oldie? Want a Sunny Leone? Barun Biswas?- - Barun Biswas? Who's that? Hello! Hello!- - Yes? Who is this man?- - Sorry? Who is he? That's Che.- - I understand, Che. But who is Che?- - Actually, a style icon. He'd write and ride on a bike. Biker-writer you know? Barun Biswas? Sorry?- - Barun Biswas! Actually Barun Gandhi, yes. Seema Biswas, yes. Barun Biswas? No. Sorry old man. Who is Barun Biswas? Please sit. Err.. How about some whisky? Anything apart from cow-dung and tiger's fat. Could've told us you wanted to meet, we'd go see you. Got it?- - Nice! Obviously, it is your duty to welcome someone like me. Take the bottle! You're a massive drunkard it seems! You swine... why did you kill Barun Biswas? Sorry. His face is so similar to that of a pig you see. Why did you kill Barun Biswas? I?- - How will he know? How will he know? He's my sweet little bro! Nothing could be proved. So he got a bail. We're throwing a party to celebrate the bail, got it? Why did the boys change the statement? Why did the boys change the statement? Why?- - I don't know. They might've. You're the bloody sweet brother. My father should know! I'm abusing again. I'm sorry. Eat.- - Oh no! There!- - Not the muffler! I'll clean it. Let me see. Where else did it...- - My foot. Foot? Where? Where? Sorry! Need to pee! Show him.- - I know how to pee. But where? Come straight and do it on the wall. Okay? Oh no!- - Wait I'll pick it up. Where did it go? One rupee. Yes. It's raining. Make it fast! What are you doing! Brick for a brick. Stone for a stone. Got it you swine? Holy cow! Did I pee on your face? Oh no! Actually your face is so idiotic... abusing again, sorry. The coins.- - Keep them. Buy a soap with that, never know when you stain your face. Barun! No one remembers you. Who did you fight for? A Barun Biswas doesn't do anything for anyone. When a shining sword peeps out from a dump of rusted iron.. It needs to be held high with respect. And that self-respect is called Barun Biswas. Explain this to everyone sir. People deserve government. The law and order of a nation depends on how its people are. So, people themselves need to change. Exactly! People will have to change. That's a very hard job sir. All are crumpled in fear. They'll gab Shakespeare sitting at home, 'Cowards die many times before their death.' They'll teach their kids, 'to do or take injustice, both are both hateful.' Promote honesty but go grab someones promotion at work. This is the nature. It is in the veins. You can't do it sir. Doesn't Barun Biswas's fate explain it? And what if one finds a shining age old piece of steel in that rusted dump of irons? Best of luck sir. Goodnight. Goodnight Mr.Bachhan. What? Just a sauce stain. Was having some snacks with alcohol. It fell. All the respect you just gave me vanished when you smelt alcohol? Anyway. Pretty late. Go sleep Mr.Bachhan. But remember what I said, people deserve government. And what were you saying? An old piece of steel in the rusted dump? See you. Dada, it was Haran's head.- - Good it is gone. There was only cow-dung in it. Madhu, Anup, Shamal...- - Yes Dada! How did it happen?- - Just one hit. What's the case?- - Is the case in our hands anymore? It is in his hands now. Then go call him!- - Are we crazy? That day's thrashing! This is an open area, God knows...- Listen to Dada! Arguing huh? Go call him. Go!- - Listen to Proshanto! We've a lot of work to do Dada. Let's go. Then let's go ourselves. Last night's alcohol is coming out even now. Five son's of Haradhon, four remain, know that? As in? Found it in the body's pocket. And... a far more interesting thing! See. The wires have been cut off as impeccably as the head. Could've killed Barun in the same way. Sorry. Didn't mean it. - - What nonsense! We didn't kill Barun. The Platform of Awakening people have done it. They're putting the blame on us. We didn't do anything. Trying to put us down.- - Is yours down? You always speak below the belt. Not only speak, I work below the belt too. Anyway. Be safe, those who's names came up in Barun's murder he's one of them. Others are Ronojit, Shekhar, Makhan, Haran. Haran's gone. Don't know who took him. Hence, Haradhan's five sons, remain only four. Terrible tension! Loads of tension! Give way please. Oh no! Even biscuits are difficult these days! Mr. Arun, where were you the day Haran was killed? Why will I say? The enquiry began four days after Barun died. Right after a goon dies you're at it? Quiet! Don't call him a goon! Know how many phone calls came for a social worker like Haran? He dies!- - Social worker? Sure, it was the society he served. Perspectives. People say Lord Krishna is God. Some say he is characterless. You don't give importance to the investigation of this murder. But it's my duty. So I ask again, where were you last night? At home. I teach, so was home after that. And that gets you by in this village? I've a small electricity business. What business? Are you saying the truth? Are you suspecting Arun? That's the problem. I'm suspecting you too Mr.Bachhan. Mr. Nikhil, Mr. Kingshuk, the demon slayer Goddess, suspecting all of you. Weird similarity between special branch officers and girlfriends. Both are extremely suspicious! Would've suspected my dead dad too... a teacher in Kolkata, why come to this forgotten village? No one owns this village, I don't need permission. True. You have them in front of you, can't get hold of them? I have a lot of people in front of me. But can one catch hold of everyone? I'm getting late for school. Let me tell you one thing Arun can't do this. His philosophy for people, for life, One minute! Another lecture? No time now. See you in Puja holidays. Be safe, you guys. Can't size this man up. Keep your thoughts to yourself. There's no need to depend on others. Okay? Bye. Grandpa, one question, if you don't mind. Does it matter if I do?- - Not really. Let me ask then. What is your father's name?- - Why? Not 'Y'. An 'H'. 'H' for Haradhon. Haradhon's five sons, remain only four. Here. Found it at the crime spot. Who could it be? Arun? Barun? Or all of them? Namaskar.- - Please come. Namaskar. Please sit. Tea or coffee?- - Don't bother. Tea? Is this a tea shop? So many almirahs, take out a bottle. Will finish it in no time!- - Proshanto! Let's talk work. We have a Party Meet day after. Yes.- - So, I decided to set it up here in the school. But there are some tests to be conducted in school day after. So what? Postpone it to the next day. Any problem? Yes, there's a problem. School closed for a political party's meet? Not acceptable. Mr. Binod, why get into this?- - Have to if needed! Some political hooligans will come and close the school, we'll accept it? You know who he is? The chairman of the school committee. Educational qualification? First standard? You! I will... Will kill you! Peeing on the face wasn't enough? Brother! New teacher? My foot! The Meet happens here. And in this school! Got it? Bye. Come Proshanto. You'll do good. You'll make it big in life! I'm leaving. Please sit. Tell me what you were saying. What's the point? Your eyes are red, will you remember? Don't worry. Just say, now that you've thought of it. Once you say it you'll feel like you've peed after a long wait. I mean you'll feel lighter. They're doing a Meet in our school. So school's closed tomorrow. Snatching away the birth right to education! We're becoming slaves!- - Sir Ashutosh! Bengali Tiger! Go home! I swear... I swear on my drink... the moment you start with your lecture ballads, all my senses stop working!- - Protector of law... I'm none of that. Get into a brawl trying to stop the Meet! Stupid enough to get into it intentionally... Fine! Sit and drink! I'll go stop them! How? Do you have a cap? Respected Chairman, oops! That's me! I have with me our dear Minister and our... representative who has come all the way from... Hello! Come on children, get in. Come, go to your classes. Come boys! Push them out! Get lost you guys! Too smart are you now? Get out! Get lost! Dada! Hello! Yes. The main topic in today's Meet is the Committee election. Our golden future! Those little kids... they... There they come! Light to you, light to us! Light the Lantern! Light the Lantern! Light to you, light to us! Come on. Run. Move! Dada. Go! Come on get out. Get going now! Circus going on! Throwing our boys out? What? Why don't you teach your Dada anything? Police will do that too? Beat you publicly, that's a gimmick. Idiot. Fix it. You hit my brother? - No, saved him. Don't do the Meet here Dada.- - Why? I'm the chairman here, I can do Meets or whatever I wish! Yes you can. But Panchayat Elections ahead. What about it? Why?- - You've closed down the school! That's become a huge issue in the village. Do you keep any news? Your stupid brother is useless. Yes but...- - Rather, get me alcohol I'll get you the news.- - Sure. But what about today? Stop the Meet at once.- - Fine. But... Listen, Meets keep happening. Vote only comes once. Definitely! Remove it. No, give me! Meet is over for today. Please go home all of you. Dada, why's it stopping?- - Fixed the hair? Alright now?- - You look like such an idiot! I thought I was mistaken. But now I am sure. Explained to your Dada. Ask him.. You're alone enough to destroy him! Come Proshanto. Thank you.- - Always at your service. Hello everyone! Hooliganism is over for today. Here you are! Grandpa... Go take your class now.- - Thank you. Wait. Why physics-chemistry? Teach them to stand up for themselves. Rabindranath wrote 'Where the mind is without tear' Fear.- - I'm talking about the girl, Tiya. See you.- - Where to? To iron my clothes. Party at night. They've invited. Bad cop in the morning. Good cop at night. The dancer's from Kolkata. I'll get some nice dinner! Fantastic! Laying out all that she has Rai sits here Where is Vrindavan? Where is Kanha? Where are you, the dark one? Come reveal yourself. Rai is sinking in the river of your love. My body has become a river of your love. See, I await you with my tresses spread out. I was born blind, bound in shackles Kanha shall bring me my sweet devastation Have been nurturing my body all the year Like the flower's pollen grains, like the wheat golden yield. I'll lose myself in you, come with me tonight Only I can fathom the waves your tide Damn! Where are you? Reveal yourself. Rai is sinking in the river of your love What an engine! What a body! Chumki!- - She's a rocket! Who was that? Chumki is in the car. Want to come?- - Where to? The graveyard? To heaven! We'll go galloping in our farm house! Capable?- - What did he mean? I'll go home!- - Brother. Government's car's going to the farm house! With Chumki! Dada, sit in front. I'll ride. Walking was better.- - You guys get this car. Oh my God! So powerful! TWO MORE LEFT You go.- - You go. You go! No, you go. Let's count? Let's go together.- - Yes. Sir, it blew up as soon as the ignition was switched on. Sent to the Forensic?- - Yes, report will come in 5 days. Found this circuit too sir.- - Where was it? Under the clutch-screw sir. The circuit was attached to the hydraulic. The ignition was... No. Circuit gets switched on if ignition is switched on with the clutch. Other end was in the gear box?- - Yes sir. Are these circuits sold here?- - No sir. No such electric shop in this area that could sell it. First ever car blown up in our area, sir. Though, a reason could be... What reason?- - What reason? Mr. Binod has restarted the Platform of Awakening. Arun, Durga.. They are there too. The way outsiders are coming in, if only one of them's a Maoist... then it is done sir! Hey you! What the hell... Who is it? Dada! Oh, it's you! Great! The half ticket is there too! Why are you on the road?- - Getting a tan. Come home, have lunch and sit in the sun. Road is okay with me. Never know what happens in your home. You speak a lot of nonsense! Let's do some nonsense too? What's in the car? Why do you care?- - Want to see. Got veggies from the market to feed the poor today. Wait, feed me first then. Where are you going? Told you we've got veggies. What nonsense! Running like fools! What's your problem? Loads of veggies eh? Now you're crossing the limit. Always done that. Radish! Oh! A luffa? An elephant foot? Here it is! Lady's finger? And what's this? An entire banana tree! For how much?- - Here, speak to Mr. Saswata. Who Saswata? Actor?- - No, Saswata Mitra. From the Writer's building.- - Oh my God! Yes, tell me Sir. Let them go? But why? Oh! So you'll smuggle in arms into the village before the vote, and I have to let them go? But I don't get it, why? Yes I know all of that. I know you very well. A few years of ministry and then to the jail. Listen, do not give me that bull crap! People have permanently ended up in the eye hospital because of me. Swine.- - Who? Take your phone. Listen. I'm taking in your car and the stuff. But I'm letting you and your brother go. Know why? Someone's already taken up the work of finishing you both for free. Then why waste government's money... and put you in the jail.- - I won't tolerate this... I give a damn! Don't you bathe him? Paid him to buy soap, he boozed up with it. Make it fast! Hurry! Night jasmine at midnight! Brilliant! Hello sweetheart! Hello! What's up? Hello! Hello?- - Still dumping? Ronojit died.- - Ronojit died? Yes, a while ago.- - Who are you? Barun. Barun?- - Yes, Barun. Believe it or not, Haradhan's five sons, remains only one. Proshanto. Sit, knot in the pajamas? No!- - Then? Barun.- - Barun? Yes, he called.- - What! Yes. You had a stomach upset, now I think you've gone mad! No its true, I'm scared!- - Dada... Madhu? Come sit. That's alright. These two constables for your security. They'll stick with you all the time. Very good. Keep this. Here; for sweets.- No need sir. It's for free. Why free?- - What if Barun sees me? Told you so.- - Why's everyone harping on this? Gone mad?- - Not me, the villagers are saying. Barun is back. He's prowling the village all night. Many have heard his bike. How can I take money now? See you Dada. Oh. Let me tell you something. After seeing Mr. Animesh... I feel like doing something in life without a personal motive. Good luck. Let's go. You guys stay here. What's up? Who took your ladder away? No one. Birds are very intuitive to nature you know? For example; that crow found out something. What?- - A wire, just like this one. It was tied tightly between these two trees. Mr. Haran drove into it in high speed and splash! Tied together like the strings of a Veena... I got the clue from the song. Oh. So you're looking for the murderer of the criminals. But you've no plans to look for Barun's killers. No sir. Ruler's don't get punished. Punishment is for subjects.- - That's what you think. Someone doesn't think so. So he's punishing. He'll punish Proshanto too.- - No. Won't let him.- - Why? People like Barun, don't save for themselves, nor let others. But Proshanto... is a rascal of the first order. In better words, a bastard! Sorry. He will get me the transfer and promotion. I need him. He can't die! Oh. But Barun can die, right? A scarcity of good things is better. Or else a crowd of good things make it mediocre. Those lines don't suit you.- - Oh. But they suit you, is it? Trust us with the lines too. What scares you? Tagore after all. Will keep him with care. Will that take care of everything? No sir. These wires aren't sold here. Not sold here?- - No, this is a copper wire. What is it used for?- - Electrical work sir. How many gauzes is this? I guess... point five. You can find this at the Chandni market sir. Chandni market, in Kolkata?- - Yes sir. This is a a copper wire. If this copper wire is electrified then... any magnetic object will become a magnet. For example; see how this magnetic object... turns into a magnet. Going home? Come sit. Come on sit. Let's see what you've done. Oh, not here. How is it going? Everything is arranged like you wanted. Full on rehearsals going on! They're slaying Hiranyakashipo too this time! You too must come. Oh. Can't refuse women...- - God! Let's go! Sure. Slaying Hiranyakashipo? Will it happen? God shall himself come to slash the enemy's chest! Angioplasty?- - Please! Thank you. I had another question. Barun Biswas, why did he influence you so much? Because I have a concept called a heart within me. Why did you thrash those goons in the school that day? I too have a concept called, the head. It loses it's cool sometimes, hence. But about these monsters getting killed... whoever is doing it, he is not doing the right thing. Just like Kshudiram. Some called him a terrorist, some called him a revolutionary. If he gets caught, the entire concept of revolt will distort in his head Could you figure out who's doing it? Not completely. A faint idea. A black face in the dark. Whoever it is, can't kill Proshanto. Why so? Government's given him security. Future leader of the youth. How strict is the security?- - Don't know. But... like you said, God will himself come to slay him. God must be knowing. He knows everything. Hence, Hiranyakashipo demons' angioplasty is shelved. He's taken a pacemaker you see. Bye. Another thing... You yourself get your requirements for the physics class from Kolkata? Yes, more or less.- - Okay. Get me some copper wires this time. Must be aware where to find it?- - Yes. See you. Namaskar. Welcome to the cultural event put up by the joint effort of Platform of Awakening and the people of Dukhiya. In today's program we present a unique piece of Bengal's tradition, Chhou dance. The Chhou show is about the slaying of Hiranyakashipo. Everything is ready sir.- - Just the way you wanted it. All those who were supposed to come, have reached. Everyone? Yes. Barun Biswas lit the fire of revolution! And he started walking with the torch lit from that fire. If someone cuts his hand of, many more hands must come up to hold that torch. Your hands! So you can proudly say... Long live revolution! Come what may... You've to be prepared. Can you?- - Yes sir! Right! Certificate of achievement, Binod Bihari Dutta. Holy cow! Brilliant! For you. Get up! Come with me! Enough! Open the mask! Open it! Look who's here! Subhash Chandra Bose! The name does not suit your lips! Bloody swine! I'll slash your throat! Is it? Let's do it then! Come! Let's talk no more. Come with me. Get off. What will my country do to you now?- - What? Frame you in many things. Put you through a lot of crap. Your revolt was for your values. You'll not be able to take it, so... I'll shoot you right here, won't have to suffer. I've done what I had to. No regrets if you kill me now. You see, a revolt is like a relay race. Barun gave me the torch of revolution. I gave it to... Durga, Arun, Kingshuk, Nikhil. They'll give it to someone else one day. Rule of society; kill the revolutionary can't kill the fire of the revolt! There was only one Barun. Now ten Baruns are born. Then there'll be hundreds and thousands. Kill me. Won't you kill me? Won't you kill me? Asking me? Can't place you, who are you? Binod Bihari Dutta.- - Namaskar. Animesh Dutta. Just got the news, my wife's given birth to a boy. Going there.- - Give him my blessings. Thought of a name? Barun. And the rest shall follow. Bye. Let's grab the sun in our hands!
