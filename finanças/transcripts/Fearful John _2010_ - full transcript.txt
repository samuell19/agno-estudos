The new boy is "it"! FEARFUL JOHN Got you. No, you didn't. I wasn't playing with you. But... You went out running. You said so. What's this? "Mutant creatures from outer space" ...wow! It's the holiday special issue. You're a bit of an oddball, aren't you? I know a hiding place, run! Why was that fool chasing us? He was just chasing me. Look. Juan, in the tale you're always fearless. How do you know my name? I'm Mary. You all come from Madrid to your grandparents' house each holiday. - Right? - Yes. Maybe our parents were childhood friends. Where my dad used to live there are loads of old comics. We may find some here. I don't think so, it's not that kind of house. None of the villagers wanted to buy it. My grandma says it's because it's haunted and there are ghosts. Ghosts don't exist. Everybody thinks she's completely nuts, but I believe her. Before she was taken to the hospital, she wrote this. THE MAN OF THE BIRDS Once upon a time, there was a peasant who took care of the orange trees and lived with his son. The child died of pneumonia and people blamed his father. A few days later, a flock of birds arrived and ate all the crops. Then, the man planted a scarecrow and all fled the village... because it was so scary... that the oranges started to rot... and the peasant had to hide it indoors. One night, he was woken up by a child crying. The man got up, lit a candle, and just when he was about to turn the doorknob... bam! The grown-ups never tell what happened because they're afraid to remember, but it's just a legend. You won't play "Tag" forever, will you? C'mon, the soil smells wet already. They're birds. They take refuge at the drop ceiling when it's about to rain. I gotta go. We can't leave until the storm goes away. One... two... three... four... Why are you doing that? Each second from the moment you see the lightning until it's heard tells us how far the storm is. Four seconds are like four kilometres. And it's me the weirdo... One... two... three... The storm is getting closer. Count with me. One... two... Here was the peasant sleeping when he heard the child crying. When he opened the door, a hundred birds got into the room to attack him. And then the peasant saw his son's spirit looking at him reincarnated as the scarecrow which had come to life. One. The man of the birds...? Dad, I was just going home. We weren't doing anything... - Help me! - I can't! I don't know what's wrong! Subtitles by Innominabilis
