(dramatic music) (waves crashing) (seagulls chirping) (dramatic choral music) (birds chirping) - [Woman] It's got to be up here somewhere. - You sure we didn't miss the turn? - Yeah, I'm sure. (birds chirping) - Well, it's not Buckingham Palace. - It's the last time I travel so far for a job. We won't get back 'til night fall. - Well, at least the pay is worth it. You know, it's not a bad place to live. I wonder what it costs. - If you have to ask, you probably can't afford it. (ominous music) Along came a spider and sat down beside her. - I tell you what, I think, I'll do upstairs. - Have fun. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music swelling) (rat screeching) - Go on. Get away, go on! Go on. Go on, get out. (dramatic music) (woman humming) (dramatic choral music) - Gee, you almost put a heart cross ways in me. (rats screeching) (woman gasping) (suspenseful music) - Go on. Get outta here. Get. (rats screeching loudly) (woman screaming) (woman screaming) (suspenseful choral music) (rats screeching erratically) (suspenseful music) - Kathleen! (Kathleen whimpering) For god sakes what happened? It's okay. It's okay. - The rats. The rats. - Rats? - The rats! - There are no rats. Are you alright? Shh, it's okay. Everything's all right. - There were rats everywhere. - It's okay, you're alright now. Kathleen, it's okay now. - Oh, my god. (heavy breathing) - I need some air. - Kathleen! (suspenseful music) (engine sputtering) (Kathleen gasping) - Come on! (dramatic choral music) (overlapping voices whispering) (overlapping voices whispering) (car engine sputtering) (overlapping voices whispering) (suspenseful chords striking) (overlapping voices whispering) (suspenseful music) (Kathleen screaming) - Kathleen. - I can't believe we made it, but here we are, Ireland. Glen Abby Manor will be getting some new tenants. Let me take you on a little tour. And who is that gruesome fellow? Oh, boy we're gonna have to get rid of him. (game beeping) But we know who this beautiful girl is, don't we? Hey, Brey, can you turn that thing off a second, huh? Say hi, to your daddy. - Hi, daddy. - Now kiss me a kiss, huh? Hmm, you happy to be here? - Yes. - Good. Oh, the lovely Maura, unpacking. - Will you put that camera down, and help me with this stuff. We've got to get this van back soon. - Okay, okay, just gonna get a couple of shots in the house. Look at those cute little buns. - Will, stop it! - Yes, I think they'll find her. (gentle music) (tense music) Whoa, hey! How'd you beat me up here? Hey, Brey. Brey. (camera beeping) You alright? (ominous music) - Can I have this room, daddy? - Yeah, sure, but did you check out all the other rooms? - I want this one. - Okay, you like this room. You got this room. (tense music) Hey. Yeah. We are officially in. - Yay. - Hmm, can we try that bed out yet? - Will, I think, maybe we should sleep in separate bedrooms for a while. - Oh, come on. - Oh, it's just I don't know. - What's Aubrey gonna think. - Aubrey knows more about us than you think. - Well, maybe we don't need to remind her. I mean, she's got enough to adjust to as it is. She's got new friends, a new school. Be nice if she had a stable family environment to come home to. - You didn't think much about that before, did you? - I thought we were okay on this. It's over. I made a mistake, big mistake. - Yeah. It's just gonna take me a while. - Yeah. Okay. Oh, geez, come here. I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go make dinner. - All right. (door creaking) (wine cork popping) I think, we should make a little toast to Eliza Laundrigan for keeping the house in the family, and to our family. - Yeah, to our family. - There you go, yeah. - I wish I knew more about her. I mean, she was just this name we heard when we were growing up. (furniture scraping) - What was that? (furniture scraping) (loud banging) - Will. - Stay. (soft knocking on door) Can I help you? - Hi, you must be the new tenant. - Yeah, you know, we just started our dinner-- - I'm Father Seamus from Holy Cross Church. - What can I do for ya? - I came by to see if everything was all right. - Oh, yeah everything's fine. We're just doing fine, thank you. - Ah, you must be a Laundrigan. - Oh, yes, I am. Actually, I'm a South now. My name is Maura. This is my husband, Will, and our daughter, Aubrey. - I'm Father Seamus. I'm sorry to call at this hour. But I was a very good friend of Eliza's. And out of deference to her I came by to, well, to welcome you and to bless the house at her request. She was a very religious woman. - Well, thank you. - May I come in? - Sure, come on in. - Please do. (throat clearing) - Hear us, Holy Lord, and dane to send your angel from Heaven to guard, protect, cherish, visit, and defend all who dwell in this home. - What's he doing, daddy? - He's blessing the house. - Why? - It's good luck. (priest speaking in foreign language) - Amen. Well, thank you. I believe, she would've wanted it. - Did you know her well, Father? - She attended the church for years. Ah, dear lady. It was sad to see her decline so rapidly. - Yes, it must have been. - Anyway, this house is too big for one person to live alone in. It needs to be filled with the laughter of children, right? - Did you grow up in Ireland, Mister? - Uh, that's Father. - Why, yes, I did. I've lived here all my life. - Have you ever seen a leprechaun? - A leprechaun, well, now let me tell ya. They have been known to roam the land. But they like it very much if ya leave out a bowl of milk for them during the night. - Can I leave out a bowl of milk, mommy? - Sure. - Well, have you had dinner, Father? We've got plenty. - Yeah, we would love you to stay. - Thank you for the offer, but I really have to go. - Well, okay. - I'll walk you out. - Well, I hope everything works out for you, and that you find happiness in your new home. - Thanks. - Well, goodnight. - Bye. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Was a little weird, isn't it? - Huh. - Huh. - [Mom] Awe. - Look, mommy, for the leprechauns. - Hey, that's right for the leprechauns, okay. - Go put it outside, sweetheart. (dramatic music) (owl hooting) (faint voice whispering) (rat screeching) (tense chord striking) (loud banging) (dramatic music) Are you playing tricks on me? - What? - Well, it's not gonna work, you know. 'Cause I'm smarter than that. And I'm not cleaning up that rat, Will. - What is with this thing? - What are you watching? - This is the tape that I made when we first moved in. - Hi, daddy. - What the hell is that? - That's what I'd like to know. I mean, it's insane. I never took the tape out. It's the same tape that was in the camera. I transferred it to the video. And it's the craziest thing. What is all this? - Were you just upstairs? - No, why? - You weren't in the bedroom when you threw some books around? - No, maybe it was Aubrey. - No, Aubrey's asleep. That's what I need, some sleep. I think, I'm seeing things. - Yeah, I'm gonna join you in a minute. I'll just see if I can figure out what's going on with this thing. - [Maura] Okay. (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) - Hello there, little girl. - Hello. - Are your parents in? - Daddy, there's a man out here! - All right. Hey, what can I do for ya? - Hi, there I'm here with the new water heater. - Oh, good, come on in. Yeah, my wife will be happy to see you. - [Aubrey] Look, daddy, he drank it. - Yeah, come on. - Ah! (metal clanking) - You need a hand with that? - Yeah, sure it seems to be stuck. - Here, give it a shot with that. (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Colleen] Hi, what's your name? - Aubrey. - [Colleen] Hi, Aubrey, I'm Colleen. Do you want to play? - Sure. - [Plumber] Yeah, that got it. (metal clanking) (dramatic music) - [Colleen] Do you like hide and seek? (light switch flickering) (dramatic music) (soft sighing) - Your water heater's here. - Oh, good. Honey, were you just fooling with the power? - Nope. - You didn't see the power go on and off. I just had a bulb break. - No, I didn't see anything. Hey, look at this? - What is it? - I don't know. I found it in the cellar. Kind of weird, huh? Look at that. - Yeah. - Look it. - Look we have a problem with the power. - I'll check the breaker. (gentle music) (ominous music) - Aubrey, did you do this? Now don't play games with me, honey. - I didn't do anything, mommy. - Well, if you didn't do it, then who did? - Maybe it was Colleen. - And who is Colleen? (tense music) (computer beeping) (computer beeping erratically) - Geez, please, don't do this to me. Don't do this to me! What is this? (ghostly voice whispering softly) (tense ominous music) Huh, come on. (ghostly voice whispering softly) (tense ominous music) (computer beeping) Come on. - Did you hear something? - No, I didn't hear anything. (computer beeping) I don't believe this. You know, this is crazy. It's like everything got broken in the move. Now the computer's all screwed up. - Well, a lot of strange things have been going on around here, weird sounds, things moving, your videotape. - What are you saying, Maura? - I don't know what I'm saying. Do you agree with me? - Yeah, I'd say that some weird things have happened. - Well, what do you think it is? - I don't know. I mean, it's an old house. - Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy, after all. - There's gotta be an explanation. - Maybe we should call someone. (shaver buzzing) - Oh, yeah. Who we gonna call? - I don't know. Someone who knows about this kind of stuff. - Oh, come on. - Hey, what about being open minded? - Hey, just 'cause I have an open mind, doesn't mean I'm gonna pay some snake oil peddler to come in here and shake a voodoo stick around the house. - Voodoo stick it's nothing like that. (Aubrey screaming) (suspenseful music) - Okay, sweetie, mom and daddy's here. (monster growling) (suspenseful music) (Aubrey screaming) - Aubrey! - What the hell was that? - Sweetie. - It was a monster! (suspenseful choral music) (computer beeping erratically) (dramatic music) - Okay, baby, stay here! Stay right here! - It's gonna hurt us, mommy. - No, it's not, baby. No, it's not. (dramatic music) (wind whistling softly) (cows braying) - [Will] Nice place. - Yeah, he must do pretty well. Hey, you sure you're okay with this? - Yeah, we'll give it a shout. See what he says. - And did it harm either one of you or your daughter? - [Maura] No. - Did it leave any tracks or footprints of any kind? - No, no, it just disappeared, literally. - I know this must sound crazy to you. - Not at all. You may have an elemental inhabiting your house. - I'm sorry. - It's a kind of primitive spirit or demon that takes on a physical form. We're just trying to put together all the evidence. - Yeah, that's what we're here for. - I may be able to detect the presence of something. - And what do you do? What do you got some kind of meter or something? - I prefer to work as a clairvoyant. - Oh, that's good. (birds squawking) (machine crackling) (tense music) - I'm feeling something here? - Ooh, he feels something. - Seems to be moving. (birds chirping) (dramatic choral music) (machine crackling) - I'm getting a reading. - Uh, this was Aubrey's room. She stays with us now. (dramatic music) (machine crackling) - Yes, there is definitely something in this room. (camera bulb flashing) (dramatic choral music) (machine crackling) (ominous chords striking) (suspenseful music) (clairvoyant breathing heavily) - [Will] Is guy alright? (suspenseful music) - [Amy] Take a look at this. (machine beeping) (clairvoyant gasping) (woman screaming) - Oh, no. - Geez. - You okay? What happened? - I don't know. My god. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (Aubrey screaming) Aubrey! (Aubrey screaming) Oh, Aubrey! Baby, are you okay? - Baby, what happened? - Baby, what happened? Baby! - My god! Go on get her in the house. Get her inside come on. - It looks like we have some animal hairs in here. Perhaps some kind of rodent. - So is that what this is all about? Somebody's got a problem with us living here. - Oh, not someone, some thing. I've never felt presence as strong before. - Okay, so we have a presence. What do we do about it? - If we have a troubled spirit, we have to find out why it's troubled. - Town records are coming up now. It seems as though some ancestors of yours, James and Mary Ann Laundrigan, built the house in 1863. I'll see if I can dig up anymore information on them. - Do you have any other physical evidence I could look at? - Not really, no. - Honey, the thing. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this. - Where did you find this? - [Will] In the cellar. It was nailed to the wall. - Seems to be some faint lettering on it. Runic alphabet, I think. - Jackpot. - What did you find? - I did a cross search of death certificates with this address. James and Mary Ann Laundrigan they had a daughter. Right here it says James died 1882 pneumonia. Mary Ann dies September the following year, suicide. - Suicide. How? - It doesn't say. But that's not what interests me. There's no death certificate for the daughter anywhere. - Do you have the name? (computer clicking) - Colleen. - Colleen. (dramatic music) Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen? - Yes. - What friend? - Can you talk to her? - She talks to me. - What is this, a friend of yours from school, honey? - It's an I imaginary friend. - Ah. (dramatic music) - What does Colleen say to you? - She says she's lonely. - [Shea] And where is she? - She's here. - Where is she now? - She's hiding. - Can you take me to her? - She's down. - Down. Honey, what do you mean down? - Do you mean she's sad? - She's down. Help her! - Why don't you take me to her? (dramatic music) Hmm, okay. Okay. Well, we seem to be getting somewhere. - Wait a minute. She's down. Where'd you find that metal again? - Down in the cellar. - Colleen. (dramatic choral music) Colleen. Colleen. We're here to help you. Can you talk to us? If you're lonely, we can help you? Colleen, can you tell me where you are? We're here to help you. Can you show yourself to us, Colleen? - Where's she going? - [Shea] Colleen. - Aubrey. Aubrey. Aubrey. (suspenseful music) - There's something in here. - What? - There's something behind this wall. - Well, what is it? - I'm not sure. But trust me this wall has to come down. - Hey. Let's stay here. (suspenseful music) (Will breathing heavily) (dramatic choral music) - Oh, my god. Colleen. Oh, Colleen. (somber music) (priest speaking in foreign language) (sea gulls chirping) - May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long. - Poor little girl. - While hopefully the old set up and order is at an end. And everyone, including your family, will find peace at last. - Thank you. And really we thank all of you for everything you've done for us. - And we'd like to have you over for dinner sort of give closure to this whole thing. You too, Father. - Please, it would mean a lot to us. - Thank you. (thunder crashing) Well. Slainte. - Slainte. - Slainte. - [Amy] Do you need any help with anything? - Oh, no thanks. Actually, I think, I've got everything pretty much under control. - [Amy] You have a really beautiful home. - Thank you. If you'd have told me a year ago we'd be living here, I would've never believed it. How about you, you live around here? - Oh, no, I live in Wexford. It's about a five-hour drive from here. - How we doing? - I think, everything's ready. - Great, I'll start bringing things in. - Alright, hon. (thunder roaring) (rain splashing harshly) (dramatic music) (thunder crashing) Okay, here it comes. - You know, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. - Well, I'm afraid you'll have to settle for turkey. - Oh, that looks delicious. - Doesn't that look good. - Honey, will you call Aubrey down for dinner again? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Aubrey. Come on, honey, it's dinner time. - In a minute! Colleen. - Oh, I'm sorry, Father. - Thank you, oh, Lord for the food before us, amen. - Amen. - Amen. (ominous music) (spirit groaning) - Let me get that for ya? - No, I got it, thanks. - Okay. (spirit grumbling) (suspenseful music) (Maura screaming) (thunder crashing) (suspenseful music) (Maura screaming) (glass breaking) - Shea! Shea! Oh! (suspenseful music) (ghost voice whispering softly) (soft gasping) (glass shattering) (loud screaming) - Oh, my god! We gotta get Aubrey. - [Spirit] Get out! (loud screaming) - Aubrey. It's stuck, Will. - Honey, let me get it. - [Maura] Aubrey! - Step back, step back. - Aubrey. - Aubrey. - Aubrey. - Aubrey. - Oh, my god! Will, the window. (thunder crashing) - Aubrey! - Aubrey! Aubrey! - Aubrey! Aubrey! Aubrey! - Aubrey! - Aubrey! (loud screaming) Will! Will! Will! (suspenseful music) - Come on. (Maura gasping) We gotta find her. - You didn't find her. - No. Shea's dead. - What? - The cellar. Te cellar, Will. (suspenseful music) (eerie music) (overlapping ghostly voices moaning) - No! Aubrey! Aubrey! - Will, what is that? - This isn't happening! - The amulet where is it? - What? - Where have you put the amulet? Where is it? - What are you talking about what amulet? - Did you remove anything from that cellar? - How'd you know about that? - Because I put it there. (ghostly voice whispering) Your daughter's been taken. - What! - I said nothing because I was afraid you wouldn't believe me. I've been here before to remove evil from this house. The amulet is a guard against evil blessed in countless rituals. It's an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic Church. - What does have to do with Aubrey? Where is she? - You must return the amulet if you want your daughter back. Your ancestors James and Mary Ann Laundrigan were practitioners of black magic in this house. - What does that have to do with us? - The villages cut off both his hands as a punishment. (man screaming loudly) He died of gangrene. Mary Ann took her own life before they could burn her at the stake. James vowed that there would be a curse on this house forever. - Where is my daughter? - We laid Colleen to rest. The evil has taken Aubrey in her place. - Please, where is she? - Your daughter is in grave danger. Where is that amulet? - I gave it to Shea. - Is this what you're looking for, Father. - That's it. - Yes. (suspenseful music) (ghostly voices groaning) I'm going to need a hammer, some nails, and a candle. Oh, and some pearls and onyx. - I'll get the hammer. - I have some pearls. I don't have any onyx. - Don't worry, I have. - Here's your hammer and nails. - Where does this amulet come from? - It's origin is unknown. But the symbol matches that of my dagger. I found them both years ago in the ruins of Clonmacoise's Abby. But the dagger saves the soul of the possessed if it's plunged directly into the heart, so the ancients believed. - [Amy] By killing them. - By freeing them. - I don't understand. - The dagger destroys the evil, and frees the soul it possessed. - [Amy] What do these ingredients mean? - The pearl is the twilight, the divinity. The onyx is the signal of death. As I said only fragments of these rituals exist. And as far as I know, this is the procedure. Now it suppresses the forces of evil. It doesn't destroy them all together. Now I'm going to need some blood from a woman. (suspenseful music) (ghostly voices groaning) Rise, unless it remain. This force is like a parasite or a virus. It feeds on suspicion and doubt and fear. Now you must clear your mind for it to reach out. - How do we do that, Father. - You must lead her out. Talk to her, calm her fears. Only she can cross over. Well, go ahead. I believe, right now she may hear you. - Aubrey. Aubrey, can you hear us? It's mommy. (thunder crashing) - [Aubrey] Help me, please. - My god, I heard something. - Aubrey. Honey, we're here. Don't be afraid. - [Aubrey] It's dark. - Honey, we want you to come back to us. - [Aubrey] I can't breathe. - Aubrey, baby don't be scared. Okay, it's just like a bad dream. Listen to us. - Keep talking. - Aubrey, it can't hurt you if you're not afraid. - [Aubrey] Daddy! - Just think about mommy and daddy. We're here for you. - [Aubrey] I can't move. (maniacal laughter) - Aubrey! Aubrey. Aubrey, Aubrey are you still there? - Concentrate she can hear you. - Aubrey, Aubrey baby come back to us, okay. - [Aubrey] Mommy, help me. - Don't be afraid. - [Aubrey] They're hurting me. - [Spirit] Tell her she's ours. (loud bang) - [Aubrey] Help! (suspenseful music) (suspenseful choral music swelling) - Baby! - Mommy, I'm scared. - [Maura] Baby! - My god she's in there. - [Aubrey] I'm scared, daddy. - No! No! No, Will. - Get out! (hysterical crying) (suspenseful music) - I'm scared! Daddy, please! Daddy, I'm scared! - Close your eyes, Brey. (suspenseful music) (chains clanking) It's okay. - [Maura] Aubrey. Aubrey. Aubrey. - It's okay, honey. She's all right. She's all right. Are you okay, baby, huh. - Alright, huh. (Maura sobbing) Come on let's get her out of here, come on. (thunder crashing) - As long as the amulet remains in place, the house will be protected. - That's reassuring. But the only time we'll be spending in that house, is the time it takes us to pack our things. - Look after the girl. Look after your family they're important. - Yeah, they are. (door creaking) How you doing? - Okay. - Yeah. How you doing? You okay? - A few years older perhaps. - Here I'll get that for you. Here you go. Easy. - I suppose I should go. - I'll take that too. - Goodbye. - I'm gonna walk her out. - Are we leaving now, mommy? - Yes, baby, we're leaving really soon. - Take care. (crickets chirping) I'm sure we'll all sleep better in this hotel tonight. Don't you think, honey? Hey, you okay? - Are we going back to California, daddy? - Well. What do you think we should do? - Maybe you have a reason to stay here. I mean, you seem to appreciate the local scenery. - What do you mean by that? Hey, Maura. Hey. - Will. - Hey, come here. You don't look too good. You feel alright? - What's wrong with the way I look? - I don't know maybe you're coming down with something. - No, I'm fine. - Okay. You know I was thinking about what Father Seamus was saying about distrust and discord. You don't have anymore doubts about me, do you? - Should I? - No. You two are the most important thing in my life. I don't ever wanna lose you. - I'm tired. - I don't see why you should be. Goodnight. - See you in the morning. - Yeah, see you in the mornin'. (heavy sighing) (crickets chirping) - [Priest Voiceover] It is real, and I've seen it in many forms and many disguises. The human evil is self-evident in this world, but there are other purer forms belonging to the vapor and the darkness. Save for the power of holy, unconditional love, for that is the one force it can never defeat. This I have to discovered. (dramatic choral music) (gentle music) (dramatic choral music) - Wait a minute. Do you hear something? Do you care? (soft moaning) Oh, that feel so good. (people moaning) (suspenseful music) (people moaning) - Ooh, somebody likes to watch. (maniacal laughter) - No! (birds chirping) - I'm finished. Where are we gonna go, mommy. - Uh, we're going someplace new, honey. - What about all my other stuff? - We'll get it later. - How long will it take? Mommy. (gentle choral music) Mommy. Mommy, how long is it gonna take? - Go to your room now! (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (pulsating drums beating) - We ready? - You don't think I know! - Know what! - You think I'm an idiot? - What? (heavy breathing) - Nothing has changed, has it? I still can't trust you. - Maura, what are you talking about? Son of a... Hey, Maura, what is this? - We're not going. - What. What are you out of your mind? Tell me what's going on what did I do? Maura. - You leave and don't you ever come back. - Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Till you tell me what's going on. - Now! - Aubrey. (suspense music) Open the goddamn door! - What's happening, mommy? - Your father doesn't love us anymore. - What do you mean your scaring me? - Like I said he doesn't love you anymore. - Ow! - You're not going down there. - You're hurting me. (gentle music) - And he'll never come back. - Mommy, what's happening to you? - Your father's evil. I sent him away. - What did he do? I wanna see daddy. Ow! - You don't believe your mother, do you? Do you? - Ow. - I should've known you couldn't. You love him more. You love him more, and you believe all his lies. - Mommy! - I'll teach you to turn on me. You can just stay here and think about it. (lock engaging) - [Aubrey] Mommy, mommy! (suspenseful music) (suspenseful chords flashing) (soft sobbing) - Somebody likes to watch, likes to watch, likes to watch. (loud screaming) - He dares to disrespect me. - [Will] I mean you don't have anymore doubts me, do ya? You don't have anymore doubts me, do ya? - He dares to disrespect me! (voices whispering softly) It's time to teach them a lesson. (birds chirping) - Father Seamus. Father. Father. Father. (heavy breathing) (ominous music) - Mommy, mommy! (gentle choral music) (heavy breathing) - [Priest] Should the force return, I fear more drastic measures may be necessary. I don't know if they or I will have the strength. The dagger destroys the evil and frees the soul of the possessed. (suspenseful music) - Mommy, mommy, mommy! - Mother's just awful when she's like this. (gentle choral music) - Colleen. (tense music) - You're coming with me. We'll suffer together. Ah! Aubrey! (Aubrey screaming) (suspenseful choral music) (thunder crashing) (dramatic music) (scissors whirling) (Aubrey gasping) - [Will] Aubrey. (loud screaming) (dramatic choral music) - Mommy, no. Please, mommy. (dramatic choral music) - Maura. Get away from her! Aubrey, run! I'm sorry. - Mommy! (Maura hissing) (scissors whirling) Daddy. (will groaning) (suspenseful choral music) (Maura screaming) Mommy, daddy! - Brey, get back! - Mommy, stop! (Maura screaming) - Come back to us, Maura. - No. We'll destroy you! - No, you won't! - No! (loud screaming) No! (piercing demonic screaming) (gentle music) (overlapping voices groaning) - Mommy. - Baby. What's happening? (suspenseful music) Baby, what happened? What's happening? - [Will] Whoa, we gotta get out of here. - [Maura] Will! Will. - Come on let's go. (Aubrey screaming) - Baby. - It's okay, honey. - We here. - Hey, hey. We're safe, you're safe. - We're here. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Yeah, baby. (glass shattering) - [Will] You're okay? - You're bleeding. - I'm fine, so glad you came back to me. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (heavy breathing) Did I tell you I love you guys so much? (dramatic choral music) Come on. Let's get out of here. (fire crackling) (animal spirit growling) (spirit laughing evilly) (dark dramatic music) (dramatic choral music) (suspenseful choral music) (overlapping voices groaning)
