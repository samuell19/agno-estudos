What? He's gone? Well, Dr. Ekon, find him, now! That was Ben Jammin' and Melodynamic All-Stars with "Burnin' Alive." In trending news, the police are still looking for a suspect in the kidnapping of Elizabeth Hess, a young college woman. Police have asked citizens to call with any information that may help in finding this young woman. Now back to the tracks. This one is fresh from Barcenillia, "Bittersweet." Wake up, Sarah, you're late. - Can you drop me off? - No. It's too late to catch the bus. Wake up earlier next time. Hello? Hello, Richard, good morning. Today you will be working for Mr. Smith. Hey, Richard. Hey. I see you, uh, got the job. Oh. - Yeah. - Congrats. Oh, hey, did you give it some thought, getting food from a food bank, or maybe even food stamps? It would really help you and Sarah out. We're fine. Richard, I hope you don't mind, I took Sarah to school. - You did? - Yeah. I couldn't say no to her. Yeah. I know what you mean. See ya. - Morning, Mr. Smith. - Good morning. Where to, sir? Sky Harbor Airport, and hurry up. - Dude. - What's good? What's good? Come on in. Make yourself comfortable. You want somethin' to drink? Nah. I just came to chill for a minute before I go back to work. Hm. What you workin' for, my dude? Bills. You know... you could make way more money movin' that stuff for me. Nah. I ain't tryin' to go back to jail. Who are the learned... for those that practice what they know? Hey, Angie, what's up? Victor called in sick today, so can you cover for him? - Sure, what was his assignment? - He was supposed to pick up Mr. Swift's daughter from her violin practice. - Where at? - I can text you the address. - OK. - Thank you. - Hey. - Can you pick me up? Are you freakin' kidding me? - Take the bus. - I can't. A dance audition came up, I can't miss it. I'm at work. I gotta pick someone up, and I can't be late. Please? It won't take long, I promise. - Be ready when I get there. - Thank you. Thank you. You owe me. Bye. Where's the driver? See ya later. Hey, Angie. Sorry, I'm stuck in traffic. Richard, you should've been there already. I'll be there soon, I promise. You wanna hang out for a little while? I can get some girls over. Nah, I gotta make more runs. You are workin' entirely too hard, my friend. An empire wasn't built in a day. True. You should consider getting into the pimpin' business. Plenty of money to be made, less battles to be fought. You can build your empire faster than you can imagine. I hear you. I just don't like dealing with the girls. Becomes a hassle. It's way less of a hassle than being shot at by your competition. Look, all you gotta do is get the girls. Pick up, drop off. Nothin' to it. You'll make a little less than me, but, you know. I pulled your file. Seems this ain't your first rodeo. Am I being charged with something? Theft, possession of narcotics, assault. You got quite the history here. You tell me. If I'm not being charged, I'd like you to let me go. Or at least give me my phone call, so I can call my lawyer. OK. You're free to go. We're not done here. How is it my fault? Really, Sarah? If, and by if, I mean when, the cops decide to put this on me, I will go to jail. Who will take care of you then? - I can take care of myself. - Yeah. Sure you can. How can she not see where I'm coming from? Oh, and get this, she can take care of herself. She's a kid. Yeah, I know. That's why I've got to clear my name. Work with the police, they'll help you. Hell no. I've got to find the girl myself, then she can clear my name. Crazy talk. Hey, I'm here, open the door. I've got the drinks. And I've got the pizza. So what's it gonna be tonight? I was thinking we can watch season five, Supernatural. Sounds good. You're not really considering this nonsense. Yeah, I am. It's no worry, though. I'll talk to some people, they'll get me where I need to go, - and I'll find the girl. - Yeah, see I don't buy that. I'm still in contact with some people from my past. Yeah, past, as in just leave it be. Are we watching Supernatural or not? Get off of him! You're under arrest - for the kidnapping... - Richard! and lying to Swift. - You're hurting him! - Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. Come on. - Wake up, Sarah. - Come on! - Hey... - Tell her to call my lawyer! Come on! Why won't you believe me? Because you have a bad history, Richard. If you're so sure, - then why am I not behind bars? - Oh you will be, you will. As soon as you tell us where the little girl's at. What about the piano teacher? Violin teacher. And he's cleared. - You're the only suspect. - Bullshit. I would never do something like that. Yeah? Well, your military background suggests otherwise. Are you sure this is the extraction point? Yeah, double checked! Well, where the hell are they? - Stay awake. - Stop, stop, stop! Down. Isn't suicide against your faith? I'll do it. Good man. Detective Moro? Yeah? My name is David Peele, and as of this moment, I'll be representing Mr. Evans. You all right? Now Detective, I'm sure you'll find everything in accordance with my firm's representation of Mr. Evans. And he's to be released immediately. Now please, remove his cuffs. I'm going to Caden's house. She made us some food. Do you want me to bring you some? I'm fine. I'll bring you some anyway. Shower's to the left, got some clothes for you afterwards. - You go first. - OK. I really appreciate what you're doing. But why? When you see a brother in need you just gotta help out. Good morning. You goin' out again tonight? Money don't sleep. I got somethin' for you. - Take it. - What's up? I can't. You need to start pullin' your weight around here. - Then we'll be leaving. - You'd rather be homeless than accept my help? This... isn't help. Let me ask you somethin'. What'd this country do for you, huh? Four years of service and all you get is a shiny medal and a cold dumpster to sleep under. We gotta start lookin' out for ourselves. You gotta look after your sister. Not workin' today? Nah. I lost the job. Damn, word? You got fired? - What the hell is this? - Opportunity. I been lookin' on ways to supplement income, expand our organization. I think I found it. Come here man, let me show you somethin'. Look, I came here today 'cause I need your help finding someone. Word? All right, let me show you this, and we'll talk about it afterwards. What the hell are we lookin' at? Homie of mine, uh, got me into this deep web stuff. Sellin' girls all around the world. They're lookin' for suppliers. - What's your problem, man? - Have you lost your mind? - Have you lost your mind? - Kidnapping kids? Thank you, ladies and gents. That last auction was an exciting one, so let's make this one even better. Now, a closer look at our new merchandise. Lovely. She is beautiful, isn't she? Don't be shy... look. Look! You've seen what you're buying, so let's get started. The auction starts in three days. Happy bidding. Girls should be here soon. Good. Good, good, good. So what'd your boy say? He, um... sucker punched me. That's some funny shit. So, so, so, so, you try and do right by him... and he spits in your face, OK. You gonna let him get away with that? He did that to me? I would make sure that he regrets it. You hear me? Happy bidding. This is what they're trying to say I'm involved in. OK. Couldn't you just show that to the detective? I mean, that proves that you didn't do it. No, because according to them, I snatched the girl. So it doesn't matter if I'm not in the video. Damn. Keep an eye on Sarah for me. I'll be back in an hour. - What's up, man? - What's up? - You got the money? - Yeah. - Cool. - Thanks, man. Hey, who do you get your drugs from? What, you a cop or somethin', man? No, man. Let me see your wallet. All right. - Put it on the ground. - All right. Richard Evans. You're gonna get yourself killed, man. Richard! What's-what's wrong? - Oh, God. - Don't. Screw that, I'm calling. I'll be in trouble if you call the cops. But you're hurt, I have to so something! Take it easy. You have two fractured ribs. Did you... Called my friend. - He's a nurse. - Thanks. Mm-hm. Take it easy. - Hey, Doc. - Richard. Long time. It's good to hear from you. How's your family? We're good. It's just Sarah and I now. Our parents passed a while back. Oh, sorry to hear. How can I help you, son? Would it be... possible for me to get some project F? Ah, you know I can't do that. Unless, of course, you're planning on returning to service. Someone I care about is in trouble, and I have to do something to help them. All right, I'll see what I can do. Man, I could go for like three cheeseburgers right now. Yeah? You don't want no fufu? That, too. No, no, no, no, man. Fufu is an African dish, man. What's in it? Uh, it's grated cassava inside a goat meat soup, Mm. - I tell you what. - What's that? When we get outta here, I'll have my first fufu with you. No doubt. You OK? Yo, what's up here, what's up here? Breathe big, open your mouth, uh-huh. Look at me, look at me, come on, come on. Come on, you're OK, you're OK, you're OK. Red'll get you going, green'll bring you down, and blue will stabilize. Thank you, Doc. Good luck, son. Brotha, how can I help you? Hey, you know what's up, act funny, you're dead. Everything in the bag now. Let's go, everything in the bag now! - All right, man. - Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Call the cops! I'mma kill you! Javier Diaz, you're gonna get yourself killed, man. You never answered my question. Who do you get your drugs from? - Screw you! - Tell me! His name's Carlos! Carlos Ricardo, I was supposed to meet him at this spot tonight. 35th and McDowell. Thanks for the info. You know, you broke my ribs. Consider us even. Let's try this again. If you disobey me, you will go without food. Get up. Get on your knees. Good. Now come closer. Get up! Now beg. Beg for your food. Please. Get off me! Stop it, stop! Stop, stop, let go! Richard? Detective. We headin' somewhere dangerous? What do you want, Detective? Where you headed with the vest, Richard? To a pawn shop to sell it. You know you're not off the hook, right? Why are you so hellbent on making me the bad guy? Because you are. Six months ago, I let a man off the hook, he slaughtered his whole family. I'm not a killer. You know, we found a video of the girl. Now, I know it's not you in that video, but I know you're involved. You found a video of a girl being abused and molested by a man who's clearly not me, and you still believe that I'm involved. I never said anything about her being abused. - What? - I did not say a thing about the girl's condition. Now, either you were there, or you saw the same video I did. Now, you know where she is, and you're planning on taking them on yourself? I don't know anything. Look, I will arrest you for withholding crucial information. One moment I'm a criminal, the next I'm withholding information? Make up your mind, Detective. If you wanna find the girl, I suggest you do your damn job. Yeah, yeah, help yourself. I think that's an excellent idea. She's smart... - You don't have to turn it off. - Nah, it's cool. We don't want you interrupting - our girlie show. - I'm headed out. So you guys do whatever it is you planned on doing. And be safe. You should take your own advice. I'll be fine. Well, you better be, or I'll kill ya. Ew. Be good. ...my house! That's right, pull your gun out. Shoot. Yeah, that's what I thought. And when JD gets here, you tell 'em. No guns at my house. All this shit 'cause you bought some kids on the Internet! Easy. I don't want any trouble. I just came to talk. You bring a gun into my house, in front of my kids, and you wanna talk? I have nothin' to say to you. Get up, get up! This is the last time you come into my house and disrespect me. Kill him. So now you ready to talk? Eat shit. A little girl's been kidnapped. What do you know about kids being sold on the deep web? You know, I just started walking... without a cane. All right, all right, I'll talk. So talk, damn it. It's a guy named Chris in North Phoenix. 2341 North Helena Drive. That's it, man, that's it. That's all I know. I swear. I think you're too lenient with our son, sometimes. You shouldn't be hanging out. Ah, don't move, don't. - Put the pizza down. - OK. Where's your wallet? Come on. Solomon Bates. I know who you are, keep it moving. Pizza! Finally. I was just puttin' it out there. I think you're still living in the past where boys and girls are separate. Go, go, go, go! Drop it. Stand up. - Where's your phone? - Uh, in my bag. Give it to me. Yo, what about her? Leave her, let's go, we ain't pickin' her up. Caden? Where's... Sarah? Uh, easy, easy. Easy. Tell your friend... thank you for me. He's not gonna do it again. Did you... did you see who took Sarah? There were two of 'em. Uh, one had a... had an arm sling. Where's my vest? Be careful. Richard? Where is she?! Tell me where she is! Tell me where my sister is! He'll rape her. He'll rape her till she passes out. Then he'll wake her up and do it again. Shit. - Richard. - Doc. How you feelin'? Feel like I'm dyin'. We're all dyin' son. It's just a matter of when and how. So, you have any soreness or pain that's not physically inflicted? Just some stomach and chest pain. Your stomach's hurting? Yeah, yeah, little bit. And I suppose you've been checking your blood pressure like I asked you to, right? All the time, sir. Uh-huh. All right, let's take a closer look, shall we? All right, you're gonna hold completely still, and don't move. You're having tightness in your heart, aren't you? Yes, sir. And the headaches, they're a lot worse than what you're tellin' me, aren't they? Yes, sir. Richard, I know you're abusing the pills. I told you what would happen if you did this. Basically, the pills are destroying your body because of frequency of use. You have to lay off and let your body rest. You keep this up... and they will kill you - Do you understand me? - Yes, sir. Lay off. I'm sorry I had to come back here. I just... didn't wanna be alone right now. It's OK. Did you find out anything? About Sarah? No. I had a lead, and when I confronted him... he killed himself. That doesn't even make any sense, I mean. Oh, God. Things are getting out of control, Richard. I mean, I tried to be understanding, and I tried to let things go your way, but clearly that was a bad idea. - Don't start. - You know what, you're too arrogant for your own good. I don't need a lecture right now. So if that's what you came here for, then you can just leave. No, you're... you're full of shit, Richard! All of this could've been avoided if you'd just allowed the detective to help you. Get out. Get out! Now! What's up, man? The hell happened to you? I've been askin' myself the same question. You want somethin' to drink? I'm good. You look like shit, homie. Got into a fight with some people. Now that's some gangster shit. That's why I came here. I need your help. I'm always down to whoop some ass. My sister's been kidnapped. Shit. I think it's the same people that took the other girl. I know you've been trying to expand into that. I need your help to get 'em out. You're family. I got your back. Are you ready? Good morning, ladies and gents. The day is finally upon us. I hope you're ready with your checkbooks because we have a delightful surprise for you, our loyal clients. What you've just seen is the new addition to our collections. Normally, we would hold an auction for it alone, but I've decided to throw her in half off to the lucky winner today. - Take her and get her ready. - Yes, sir. And clean her up. You sure this is the right spot? Yeah. You strapped? I don't need a gun. Goin' in without a gun. Let's go. Going through the front gets you shot. - It doesn't matter. - I'm out then. You got a better idea? Yeah, go through the back, catch 'em by surprise. All right. I'll go 'round back and make some noise to bring 'em out there. Then, you bust through the front. All right. Good, you're up. What's going on? I knocked you out. Why? For the money. You sold me out. I sold you and your sister out. I'ma kill you, and sell your sister to the highest bidder. It's my way into the business. Hey. Be careful not to reopen your wounds. What happened? He... saved your life. How did you know where to find me? Well, you told me to do my job. So I did. I found you laying next to a corpse. That's why you got the cuffs on you. You got some explaining to do. What time is it? It's 10 o'clock. No, no. Hey, relax, you're fine. Once the auction's complete, they ship the girls over to a remote location where the buyers pick 'em up. That process takes place tomorrow. - So when are we heading out? - We? Look, you're not going anywhere. My team and I, we've got it figured out. - You have to let me go. - Look... I know that you don't have anything to do with the kidnapping. I also know they have Sarah. Now you still have a dead man... that needs to be answered for. So unfortunately, until that gets sorted out, you're on house arrest. I wanna make myself perfectly clear. You violate that, you're going straight to jail. Now you two have a good night. Can you push me in the cart like you used to? No. It'll be fun. Come on, Sarah. Please? Please? - Fine. - Yes! I expected more of a fight. It's pointless. Sarah's in trouble, and you think it's pointless to try and save her? Everything I've done up to this point... it's only made things worse. It's only made things worse because you've tried to do it all by yourself. You heard him. Go to jail if I leave the house. Since when do you listen to anyone? What do you want me to do? I want you to get off your ass and save Sarah! No? Fine. - Cade? - What? Thank you. Detective. What the hell are you doing outside of your house? Look, I know you're mad, but please hear me out. - No. - No please, Detective. You have to let me help save my sister. Afterwards, I'll be more than happy to go to jail. - You ruined that chance. - Please! I could've went alone, but I came to you instead. Yeah, that's because you didn't know where to go. I found the kidnapper's house by myself, didn't I? Please, Detective. All right, look. If you come with us, you stay the hell out of our way. I promise. Thank you. Thank me later, come on. Put 'em in their cell. Set up the live feed, and make sure we don't lose signal like last time. Come. Good girl. Fetch. What are you standin' around for, get to work! - What do you want me to do? - Just hang back, you let us do our job. - I came here to help. - Get your ass back in the car. All right, the plan is to stop them before the transaction is complete, OK? Our priority is to save the captives. What about the scumbags buyin' the girls? Well, we have a team in place hacking their service. - Any questions? - Let's do it. All right, let's go. Let's congratulate Mr. Smith, our most recent winner. This concludes our auction. Be sure to check back next month for fresh merchandise. Until then, I bid you farewell. Mr. Smith is the only one who likes to pick up his girls personally, and he's punctual, so get 'em out, and move 'em downstairs. You got it. What are you doing? - Cops! - Shit. Put 'em in their cells and get out there. Lead the cops away from this room. What are you gonna do if we can't? You will, or I'll kill you myself! Shit. Didn't I tell you to keep your ass in the car? You're welcome. You just love to disobey orders, don't you? It saved your life. Shit. Come on, let's go, the others need help. Shit! - Are you hit? - I'm good! - Drop it! - Screw you! Mr. Smith, hi. I suggest you not come. We're experiencing some difficulties. No, rest assured, your merchandise will be delivered to you. Sarah? Hey. Are you OK? Damn it! Come, it's time to go. Ow! That's how you repay me? Go! Go! You OK? You need some help holding that gun? Shut up! - On your knees! - Or what? If you wanted to kill me, you'd already've done it. Hey, freak! Show me. Dr. Ekon, you gotta get better control of your experiments, especially the ones wearing my face. Yes, sir. Believe me... this won't happen again. Be sure it doesn't. Now clean this mess up. Have a seat. It's been settled. Richard has agreed to the terms in favor of a full pardon, so we've wiped away Richard's criminal records, and he's now been reinstated into active service. Another fine job, Mr. Peele. I'll be in touch. How about we get some pizza? This late? As the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods.
