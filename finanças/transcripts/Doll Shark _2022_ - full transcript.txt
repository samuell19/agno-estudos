(rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - [News Anchor] A storm warning is in effect for Wellsboro County from 5:00 p.m. until midnight tonight. Wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour are expected. Please find shelter indoors until the storm has passed. (waves crashing) (tense music) (thunder rumbling) - Come on you hell beast, just a little closer. (dramatic music) I've been hunting the devil shark for days, slowly, methodically. Stalking it much like a shark does its prey. This is no ordinary shark though, I'm convinced it's possessed by something dark, sinister and evil. It's killed several locals including two children, plucked from life while swimming on the beach. I take that personally. I have a child of my own, and I'm being paid to kill this monster (shark roaring) once and for all. (thunder rumbling) (shark groaning menacingly) (spear piercing) (shark hissing) Die you devil fish. (shark howling) A souvenir for my kid. (shark gasping) (office workers chattering) See Shark Swim, this is from my son's favorite TV show, he's going to love it. And this will bring him luck. (tense music) - Kirby. It looks like your deadbeat dad remembered he still has a kid. I wish he was that timely with his alimony payments. Kirby? - Yes mom? Oh boy, from dad. Mom, I got a See Shark Swim doll. Cool.

Today we'll be talking about two of our favorite things, evil dolls and weird shark movies. Yep, we're talking about the new film Doll Shark, which got me thinking, gave you guys noticed that toys have gotten pretty violent and dangerous lately? - Oh yeah, yeah, well I think it's a backlash, because after the 70s and 80s when we had things like sharks, and kids were getting impaled. All of a sudden everything had to be Nerf and soft, so I think it's just going back to the way it should be. You've got now, I think they're bringing out (indistinct) with curare tips on them to poison the kids. I don't know, that's what I think. - Hmm, personally I like it, I think that kids are getting soft. I think that they need things to toughen them up a little bit. I'm really for this whole dangerous toy thing, frankly. - You know what? I agree. Natural selection, harsh but fair. And we need a little bit more of it out there, people have gotten too soft. As long as it doesn't go too far. Let's not bring back ventriloquist dummies, 'cause those things are ridiculous. They're scary and terrifying, and they encourage insanity. These kids have already been pushed pretty far the last couple years, We don't need to tip them over into carrying around a little wooden human and pretending that it's real. and having people buy into this nuttiness, this craziness, encouraging them. And they'll do things like the dummy will insult someone, and the person goes up face-to-face with the dummy, pointing jabbing their finger into his little wooden face. And the ventriloquist holding him back, I'm trying to keep the dummy from anything. And it's like, no, no, punch the ventriloquist in the face, he's the one insulting you. What are you stupid? What were we talking about? (crickets chirping) (tense music) - (screams) Mom. (tense music) (creepy laughing) (tense music) (man growling) (mellow music) Oh mom. (mellow music) (suspenseful music) That's not possible. - Yeah, I am so looking forward to it. A few days alone with you at the shore. No. Of course. He doesn't know yet, I'll tell him after lunch. I hired a sitter to watch him for a few days. Yeah, we'll do that. (Kirby humming) - See shark swim. Shark see shark, swim, swim, swim. Shark, see shark swim. (dog panting) (Kirby humming) (dog growling) (mellow music) (dog growling) Be a good boy and go home. (dog growling) (shark snarling) (dog crying) (tense music) I guess you scared him away.

Besides, I have other things to do tonight that don't involve watching TV. - What could you possibly have to do? - Grownup things. If you don't go to sleep I'm gonna take your sissy toy and throw it away. - Give it back. - Only if you lay down like I asked you to, if not then this is going straight in the trash. - You wouldn't. - Wanna bet? - All right you win. - All right, pipe down and go to sleep. (crickets chirping) Yeah, I know he's kind of cute, but I heard that he has a... - Has what? - A reputation. He gets down your pants, gets you all going, and then the next thing you know he leaves you with blue lady balls. - But he's got you hot while he's there, right? - No, I'm serious, I'm not giving it up for him... That easily. (tense music) - Well there is more fish in the sea than him, do you have any other options?

Have you seen anyone in the neighborhood you haven't seen before? - No, I've been here for a day now babysitting him, and I haven't seen or heard anything strange. - What can you tell me about the folks next door? - Kind of keep themselves, they're loud, sometimes they argue. I think they're swingers actually. - Why would you say that? - They have company at weird hours of the night, and it's always couples. That swimming pool of theirs is a hotbed of activity. - Such as? - Mm, don't really wanna say here in front of the kid and all. - Oh yes, I get it. Well here's my card if you see or think of anything else. - Hey, how did they? - Not sure, it could be an animal attack, they were butchered. Have a nice day. (mellow music) - What's a swinger? - Your mom, forget about it. (indistinct radio chatter) (suspenseful music) (indistinct radio chatter) (radio beeping) (indistinct radio chatter) - (sighs) We've got a damn psycho killer on the loose. - In nearby Amity the residents are still reeling from the recent shark attack and death of a young swimmer. The town has received several proposals from local fishermen, including one proposal that was a staggering $10,000. Submitted by the town's part-time shark hunter, slash full-time drunk. Local officials were outraged over the price gouging, and have vowed to seek additional outside quotes to help curtail their shark problem. Amity, as they say, means friendship, and they will need all their friends to reel in this problem. ♪ See shark swim ♪ ♪ Watch out for his big gray fin ♪ ♪ He's your friend ♪ ♪ He's my friend if you want him to ♪ ♪ See shark swim, he's happy and likes to sing ♪ ♪ Join him in the water for a real fun time ♪ ♪ See shark swim ♪ - Shut that off, we gotta go. - I'm watching TV. - This show is on 24/7, you are not missing anything.

When questioned the mayor did decline to provide additional details on those injured bathers. But did add that they were looking at some beautiful weather, that the beaches were indeed still open despite rumors otherwise. And the tourists were having a wonderful time. - Did I leave this place a mess? (phone beeping) Hey girl. - Hey, how's it going?

An animal? - That's what I said. - I thought they were hacked up by a psychopath. - What I found were teeth marks, not lacerations from a knife or implement. - Well, the suspense is killing me, what kind of animal? - I'm no expert, but I think it was... - Yeah? - I think it was a shark. - A shark, (chuckles) don't be ridiculous. How am I going to explain that? Are you sure? - 98% certain. - Well use the remaining 2% to come up with a logical explanation. A shark, who's he trying to fool?

A murder occurred here two days ago and they haven't caught the perpetrator yet. - Well, I guess you got your work cut out for you then, we'll see you around. - Hold it, you haven't answered my question, what are you doing out this late? We have dates a couple of houses down, we're going to meet them there and hang out a while. - Well, see that you get there safely and stay inside. - Yeah, sure thing. - Punks. (tense music) - What the hell? You said the girls are gonna be here, it looks like no one's home. - She said they'd be here, but maybe there was an emergency or something. - Probably that brat kid screwed everything up, what do we do now? - Well, we could leave, or we could wait till they return. - It's getting cold out here. - Well, we'll find our way inside then and surprise them. - That sounds like a plan. - Yeah, so you go around that way and look for an entrance, I'll go around this way.
