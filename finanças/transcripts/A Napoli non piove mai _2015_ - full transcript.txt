See Naples and then die. The sea, pizza, mandolins, taralli, coffee, baba cake, the Vesuvius, "pastiera", "sfogliatella”, the trash, traffic, mugging, forgers, songs. WHO LOVES NAPLES, KEEPS IT CLEAN This is the land of sun. It may be the reason why, if the sky is dark, YOu never see anyone outside with an umbrella. Because everyone in Naples wants to believe that it never rains. And this is Jacopo Degli Orti. When he was born, he was abandoned in a trash bin. He could have done many things. He dreamed of love, or maybe he just dreamed. As for women, better not talk about it. That is the reason he is inside this coffin. Life is brief, too brief to be lived without dreams and without emotions! CHEERS TO THE PUSSY But as they say, destiny has more imagination than we have. In fact, in a parallel universe of the north, destiny was at work planning huge upsetting celestial and planetary changes. But what actually was upsetting, was Sonia's last name. Miss Fruckton, despite your syndrome that over these years caused you many problems, this commission has decided, that considering your passion for art and your particular way of interpreting it, to grant you a doctorate. - My compliments. - Thank you. What matters, is having someone who believes in us. Here, miss. Remember, that in life, hardships are just a means of making things a bit less boring. - My compliments again. - Thank you. - Love, I am so proud of you. - Love, love. You were wonderful. Sonia. Dad... Follow her, jerk! Mr. Buonocore, this bank has decided. We'll grant you the loan with a convenient interest rate. Zero, zero, zero. Barnaba... Barnaba! - Barnaba, love. - And this is me, Barnaba Buonocore. Typical Neapolitan man in his forties. Thirty-eight to be exact. Dreams are free, and in fact, I'm black belt in my dreams. I still live with Mom, and take life as a game. It can't be. Every time I have a nice dream, you wake me. Every time I have a nightmare, you let me get to the end. Do you do it on purpose? - Go wash your face. We're eating soon. - So early in the morning? Early in the morning? It's twenty to one! It's not twenty to one. Itis 12:35. Everyone is so anguished! - Margherita called. - In fact! I said you were in the bathroom. She didn't believe it. She's expecting you at one o'clock downstairs. - Mom! - Huh? - Where are my slippers? - In the usual place. Usual place! I'd like to know where the usual place is. Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Sit down! Binder R/87 was found next to binder G/88. After 87, there's 88 unfortunately. You've worked here for five years and haven't learned a thing about this job. After the R that stands for red, there is an A in the chromatic scale which stands for amber, and only after that, there's G for green. So, in recapitulating, the first available place after R/87 is A/71, and only after that is there G/88. Is that clear? - Red, amber, It's clear. - I told you many times. I don't want to see personal objects in the work area. I don't want to be a daddy's girl. Stop putting him in front of me. Will you tell me what is wrong with Crucifix? Aside from the name? Come on, dear. He's handsome, young and intelligent. - He's a hustler! Come on! - Dad, we're not in the Middle Ages. You can't decide what is best for me. I know what is best for me because if I thought you should decide what is best for me, I wouldn't know anymore... maybe! - Dear! - But Dad... But Dad... Dad, my ass! I see my wish did not help you very much. Oh, no, professor. You know better than me how much time and hard work it takes to create. And how much it costs to set up an artistic installation. And I have no intention of asking money to them. No, no, ne, no, no. Hold back your tears. You will need them for other occasions. A couple of days ago, an old friend of mine who's a priest, told me about renovation works for his church. You will not be able to collect the entire amount you need, but it could be a good beginning, right? -T wish. - Of course, but... - What? - His name is Father Gennaro. - And so? - The church is in Naples! No! Let's go! "Pucchiacchella!" - Is the depressed guy still asleep? - He went to his girlfriend's. - Leave that poor Christ alone! - Poor Christ! At 33 Jesus Christ had already performed many miracles. There is only one miracle here. That he's forty and I haven't kicked him in the ass yet! Here. - What good dish did you make? - Lamb "mugnatiello” style. Oh, good girl! I hadn't vomited in a long time. Don't tell me the number of the bar code is 569. Because that is codfish that comes from Iceland. It's stringy! Don't give me a piece with bones. My mom almost choked yesterday. Margo! "ATM donates 250 Euros a day". ATM... I don't think you'll find another idiot who wastes time with you. I go to work at Uncle Roberto's office. You know that? You told me a thousand times. You know that I get up early in the morning? I get up really early and am even eating with my mouth closed. Because you said I ate with my mouth open. I'm even cleaning the toilet seat when I pee. Why don't we get a big home, - with a room for your mom too? - A room for my mom too! You realize you act like a kid and are forty years old? - Thirty-eight! - Thirty-eight. You are crazy! I don't understand. How does it work? A couple stays together only when things are going well? As soon as there's a problem, a person says: I'm leaving? - It's easy to be happy when you're happy. - What are you saying? - It's easy to be happy when... - Barnaba, I want a child! What's that got to do with it? Me too! One day... - You know that women have an earlier deadline? - Deadline? Yes. We have a deadline that is earlier. - Is a child like a yogurt now? - Barnaba! I need someone to create a family with. Alright? Deadline! How is it possible there are no towels in this house? I don't know if the nail is crooked, or the wall is. Your uncle is still waiting for the call. Dad, I won't go to uncle's office. I want to be free, Free. Sure. Free to do nothing. Sure, because you have to be free net to do anything, right? Now listen to me, look at me. If tomorrow you don't go get your job at my brother's, you're leaving this home. Because your time is up! What is it? The world day for deadlines? Aside from the fact... Remember how you made me look like an idiot with you know who, when there was that recommendation at the registry office? Remember that? But there is something I don't understand. Why give up only for someone else's fortune? You are a jerk! That's what you are! Dad, we talked ten thousand times about it. I went to Law School just to please you. And now, if I may, I want to do what I want. Practically that of taking photos that nobody sees? What trust. What depression. Depression? In my days depression didn't exist. We had no time to be depressed. Understand? Depression. Do as you wish. You want to leave? The door is over there. Leave. Alright. You asked for it! Yes, but with your money. Because as of this moment, you'll fill your bank account. - You leave without eating? - No. Eat this! Look at what I caught. I should have been a goalkeeper. Look who's here! Do you ever mind your own business? I mind my own business. I am the building psychologist. If there's a problem here, I must know it and find a solution. - Well, find it! - In fact, I have a solution for you. What is it? What are you saying? You don't understand. I can't shout. There is the cousin of the friend of Filomena's brother who married a councilor... Wait. I didn't tell you what was most important. She married a councilor who belongs to a family of... - What do you want? - 1 found you a job! - Yes, yes. - You must tell me right away because otherwise, we'll give it to someone else. - What job is it? - Watchman. - Watchman? Watchman of what? - The morgue. Peppi', please. I'll send you to the morgue. Send him, because once you go there, you never leave. You never leave! I have a job of great responsibility here. When you'll understand it, it will be too late. Miss, why do you have this? Don't you know it never rains in Naples? Excuse me. It's not that... Good thing I'm never wrong. Saint Gennaro, I understood the sign you sent me. The article in the paper. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! NO CREDIT AVAILABLE Saint Gennaro, thank you. My husband is an idiot! He wasn't upset with you. He does that with everyone. Yes, but easy. You are ripping off my head. - Excuse me, excuse me. - What kind of city is this? - Why? What did they do to you? - They felt me up from a scooter, Then they insulted me saying something I didn't understand. "Prugnacchella”... no. "Prugnatella”. - Maybe "Pucchiacchella"! - What does it mean? What does it mean? It means that, it means... - You killed her! - No! Miss, miss. Miss! - Miss! - Yes. Don't worry. I'm fine. - It's just the Stendhal Syndrome. - Did you hear that, idiot? She has the Holy Stendhal Shroud. Go on. Bring some coffee. - Do you often faint? - No, sometimes. Only when I stare at a work of art like that one. A work of art? That one is fake. Here in Naples, we have a special talent for original copies. - What are you doing here? - It's a long story. - Here's the coffee! - Thanks. Tell us about it! - Better not. I am too loquacious. - Then coffee is bad for you. Actually, I would have loved some coffee. But you are loquacious. It may be bad for you. Anyway, I just got a specialization with a doctorate on preparatory aesthetics of the unconscious and the oneiric influence on modern art. - Is it serious? - No. I am a restorer, a painter. Oh, an artist! Yes, yes, an artist. Excuse me, but why don't you stop and eat something with us? Something very light. Filomena made pasta with beans and clams... No, thanks. I have to go. Take this. Apples are astringents. - Young man! - Yes, madam? - Can you hear me? - Actually, I hear you far off, Of course. I'm up here. Can you see me over here? - No, more to the right. Good-day. - Hello, madam. Who do you want? Excuse me. I didn't see you. Do you know where Simone Poggi is? The son of Mrs. Immacolata? He's home. He recently returned because his wife cheated on him. - It's useless for you to go up because he's very nervous. - But... - Are you the plumber? - The plumber? - Are you the antenna man? - The antenna man? He's on the second floor, I'll open up for you. Second floor. Thanks. Tonino! Open the door, The washing machine man is here. Thank you! Simone! Barnaba Buonocore, do you remember me? Can I stay at your place tonight? You haven't changed. Thanks! In fact. Young man, have you already gone out? Would you please mind your own business once? The antenna man, electrician, washing machine technician. My gosh, I wanted some information. Just some information! Thank you! - Is he alive? - He made it! Unfortunately. That idiot. The next time I'll have him pay for damages. If he wants to commit suicide, why doesn't he do so in his home? He did it, he did it. Seven times. We always got there in time. Then do me a favor. Next time, arrive late. - try, but I don't drive the truck. - Come on! It's not good. Degli Orti is destroying the office. Do you understand? A punishment. He must have something. Even more, I think. Fire him. -Ican't, I can't. - Recommended? Excuse me. Do you know what bus I should take for the Church of Immaculate Conception and Purification of Mary, of the Nobles in Mount Calvary? - Have a seat. You seem so tired. - Thank you. BUS-WAITING SEAT Fifty cents! Fifty cents? Alright! There. So, miss, bus 77 comes by here. 77: Devils. That arrives close to the Church of Immaculate Conception and Purification of Mary, of the Nobles in Mount Calvary. You must get off after the third stop and take number 48: dead man speaking, that arrives close to the church of Saint Mary of Consolation and Good Death. Go another three stops, get off, and catch number 22: The lunatic. Three stops and you've arrived. But if you walk it'll take you five minutes. I ended up in a cuckoo's nest! A cuckoo's nest! Thank you. Goodbye! May I give you a hand, miss? Yes. I'm looking for the Cappella della Masseria Sant'Antonio ai Monti e Sacro Cuore Eucaristico di Gesl e Maria della Santissima Assunta. My twin brother works there, and so does my sister. - Really? Can you accompany me? - No. We're not on speaking terms. Asip? They found you in a trash bin and that's why I won't kill you. Because I am good inside. How many times did I tell you... Look at the finger. You shouldn't turn on this shitty washing machine. Look at the finger... Because when you turn it on, it makes noise and if I am inside with the lady... Look at the hand. The fellow below doesn't do a good performance and I'll send you to the cemetery. Understand? I'd slap you! Grab the apple! Saint Anthony, I am ashamed of coming to you, because I am devoted to Saint Gennaro. But it's just a matter of territory. Because if I had been born in Padua, I wouldn't have had any doubt. Saint Gennaro has a million souls to take care of, while in Padua you have more or less 200,000, 250,000 souls. A miracle for you is easier, I read in the paper that a guy went every morning to an ATM that gave him 250 Euros. And he didn't have a cent in the bank! It's no big miracle for you. Let's go! Saint Anthony, if you heard me, will you give me a sign? - Are you always here? - Mrs. Conce', you hurt me! Saint Anthony, you couldn't give me a better sign? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? - Oh, Lord! - May He be praised! Sonia! - Father Gennaro! - I was waiting for you. Finally. Barnaba. - Father, what did you do? - Me? Nothing. - You killed her! - No, it wasn't me. Come on, come on! Professor Fasoli advised me about her particular illness, but I didn't think it was so particular. He must also have told you that difficulties are just a means of making things less boring, huh? Yes, but an artist who suffers from Stendhal Syndrome, is like a florist who suffers from allergies. Like a pastry man who has diabetes. Yes, I know, like a musician who is deaf. Like Beethoven. - Who? - Beethoven. Miss, you shouldn't do this. If there is a problem, you can't rush away. Right, Father Gennaro? Talent is a divine gift. Father, you just said there is no possibility. You mean, any idiot that tells you to do something, you do it? Don't worry. Father Gennaro will help you. Right, Father? Of course, sister. Move. This way. - That is the Saint Sebastian to be restored. - No, no, no! Please don't look at it. Here there's Saint Gennaro, and there, the altar with the crucifix. I'm sure that, as far as your fainting goes, - you'll find an intelligent and pleasant solution, like you. - Sure! Go on. Leave. We are busy. Kick it! I saw you, I saw you. Don't ever do it again. Come. I'll show you your apartment, okay? - What's in here? - I'll show you. - The manger scene. - A manger scene? It's not Christmas! Miss, Neapolitans keep the manger scene lit all year, because every so often something is added... a shepherd, a sheep, a ladder. Let's go, let's go. - You like manger scenes? - Yes. Thank heavens. Tam glad you like it. It's nice, huh? It's beautiful. Miss, look at me or you'll faint again. Let's go. Et voila! This is your suite. You like it? Yes. Five minutes and we'll straighten it up. Maybe ten are needed. Esposito... Come on! Yes, yes! Come on. Please, please... Go on! Who is left? Jacopo Degli Orti, Barnaba Buonocore! Jacopo. Jacopo, it's Barnaba. Jacopo, it's Barnaba Buonocore. Don't start telling me I should have told you, because if I'd have known, I'd have come. So I came now. And don't start saying that you can't do anything for me. Jacopo, this Buonocore... Do you remember me? - What is this smell of gas? - Excuse me. Jacopone, remember how much we laughed in school? Remember when we forced you to eat lizards in a sandwich? Remember when we locked you inside the bathroom? Remember class 5 B? When you spent the whole day locked in the bathroom next to the toilet? Remember when we peed inside your thermos and you drank it? - I remember. - Jacopo, remember how we laughed? Jacopo, can I sleep here? Just tonight. No... What is it? What kind of house is this? No. I'm going. Remember that you must die. What if he's a serial killer? Miss, are you still not dressed? It's one thirty! Good morning to you too. The life of an artist is great, huh? How will you find a man like this? Who's looking for one? These are the ideas I had last night, but... You made a miniature of the Vesuvius map. - I'll remove it. Don't worry. - No, I'll take care of it. Alright, as you wish. - Miss? - Yes. Forgive my being so blunt. But what about a normal job? - Can you sew? - No. - You know how to iron? - No. - You know how to wash? - No! - These modern women! - Actually, I have a degree. I am a painter, sculptor and also performer. - Then do this performance. - Huh? Get dressed. It is one thirty and she's still undressed. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A JOB? DO YOY HAVE A DEGREE? ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A JOB? DO YOY HAVE A DEGREE? - Do you have a degree? - Yeah, sure. 30 years ago, to be a doctor, you went to... - Medical School. - Yes, Medical School. If you wanted to be a lawyer, you went to... - Law School. - Right. Yes, but today, after your degree, you must get a specialization. Then habilitation, the State exam, and enrollment in the register. Then you can do a contest, and wait for the classification. But after the classification, you get a job, right? Sure, but not with a long term contract. You begin with a short term contract, a Co-co-co... Then there is "mobility", then you are too qualified, then not enough. Finally you are perfect, and there isn't a budget for the project! Come and sit down. I'll show you what I prepared today. Nice spaghetti with "gallinella”, okay? Mrs. Concetta, you spoil me. Thank you, but I don't like chicken. "Gallinella" is a fish. It is so fresh that if you don't eat it right away, know what happens? It runs away from your plate and goes back into the sea. Miss, I'll cook for you or you'll starve to death. But what are you like at the burners? You must assist fortune, otherwise you'll be a spinster. This city will surprise you. For that matter, I have already been surprised. A hand on my ass, an insult, a ball thrown at me, and even a bucket of dirty water in my face! Well, take them as a sign of destiny. "Ass" stands for good fortune, and "water" stands for passion! And the insult? "Prugnacchella”, "purchiatella”... - Oh, "pucchiacchella"? - What does that mean? What do you call that thing up north? - What thing? - The one that's down south! - Oh, I see! - That's how we call it in Naples. It comes from a Greek word, from "purkiakos", - which means fiery cavity. - I see you know Greek. It's the only thing I know in a foreign language. They say it to pretty girls on the street. They used to say it to me when I was a girl. So your insult has become a compliment. Okay. Can we taste this spaghetti with "gallinella"? No, because it has become cold and you can't eat it anymore. Sonia! Sonia! Saint Joseph, I know that you saints speak among yourselves. I don't know what Saint Anthony told you about me. Don't listen to him. He's from the north. Things are always ok for him. I realized you can't do anything for money, the ATM... But at least for love, can you do something for me? The curly haired girl. Just to know if someone up there loves me. Not up here! Maybe higher. How embarrassing! Saint Joseph, uh... Alright. I didn't see you, not even Saint Joseph saw you. - Who is the curly haired girl? - I don't understand. You just said, "Help me with the curly haired girl". Help me with the curly haired girl? Me? Oh, no, I meant Saint Catherine. - Saint Catherine. - That is Saint Rita. That's why she didn't grant me any grace. I used the wrong name. - What strange people you Neapolitans are! - Yes. - Alittle wise. - Wise. - Alittle martyrs. - Martyrs. - A little scoundrels. - Scoundrels, yes. - Alittle. .. - A real mess. Before you faint again, I'll introduce myself. Barnaba Buonocore. Hi. I am Sonia. - Sonia? - Sonial - Yes. Sonia what? - Fruckton! - What? - Fruckton! I'll leave you to your work. That way you can continue. - Bye. - Bye. I wanted to ask you if you are staying a few days. Yes, why? Nothing. It's just something... Bye. - And... - What is it? Forget it. Bye, Saint Joseph... Otherwise, he'll be offended. - Sure. - Bye. Bye. May I kick it? Gol Yes, Mom. Yes, Mom. Don't worry. I am fine. Yes. I met a young man today who asked for the intervention of a saint to have his ATM work. Yes! No, Mom, he's not crazy. In fact, he's very pleasant. Alright, forget it. No. I'll explain later. It's just something. Alright. Bye. "Pucchiacche!" Thank you! - Peppi', is he back already? - Who? Your father? No, I didn't see him come back. - So much the better! - Wait. Where are you going? - What is it? - I have another work opportunity for you. What is it this time? Sweeper at the cemetery? Peppi', time is up. The "prologue" son is back! - What does "prologue" mean? - It means he comes back! That is why I married her, for culture. My son, you have lost weight. Do you eat? Always worried about eating. Ever since I was little. My knee hurt and you said, "Did you eat?" Why say that? Margherita called. She is furious! She said you are an imbecile and she doesn't want to see you anymore. Barnaba, do as your father says. And then return home. Don't worry, Mom. I met a lot of people. I already have many projects. It's something... Don't worry. - Did you see my sneakers? - They're in the usual place. - I knew it. - I'll get them. I have to turn off the stew on the burner. Don't worry. I came only to get my things and am leaving. Thank heavens. I will finally be able to rent your room to a young, serious university student, and earn some money. Because you... are useless. Money, security. That's all you talk about, Dad. But what about dreams, passion, joy? He who has a dream, must be an example to who no longer has any. I know your life was tough, but there's more, Dad. Believe me. Is there more stew, Mom? I'll take it with me. - What's it like to have a mom? - What's it like? It's wonderful, Jacopo. It's wonderful to have a mom. It is the reason why a guy still lives at home at forty. Who can ever makes such a stew? - Who irons your underpants? - Speaking of cleaning... Wait a minute. What is it? You do laundry at this hour? One consumes less at this hour, Yes, but with this noise you sleep less. - The noise is outrageous. - It's not noisy. - No? Does it bother anyone? - No! - May I ask you a delicate question? - Yes. - That girl... What was her name? - Marta. - Marta. How did she die? - She didn't die. - Is she alive? - Very much alive. You made a little altar. Fifty photographs. - She didn't show up at the altar. - Alright... - And after two months she had another boyfriend. - Surely ugly. - A photo model. - Okay. Penniless. Very rich, very rich. Listen, I would never be a model. Well, she went to bed with him. - What is it? - Calm down. - Whois it? - No, relax. Who is he? Excuse me. A friend of yours? You turned on the washing machine. - It was outside! - It was inside. - It was outside! - It was inside. Stop! It was inside! Sonia, what are you doing? Nothing. I am training myself not to faint. Excuse me. Sonia, Sonia! If you must do this training, I'll come help you. Thanks, but you can't always stay here. Who says? I can come every day and can stay the whole day. Stop it. If you really must faint, put this on. That way when you fall you'll remember me. - Listen. - Yes. Since you have nothing to do, why don't you come to my place tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah. - Your place? - No? Yes. Take your lipstick off. And give that ball back to the kids. It was inside! Lipstick... - Sir, will you give us the ball? - Only if you give me a little kiss. - Alright. Keep the ball. - Keep the ball? Incredible. - Have you finished? - Yes. - Listen, you have a helmet, I've a scooter. What if... - No. Electricity, gas... This seems strange. A fine for speeding. Marta! You look good. Happiness in Manual Love? Well, well! No, The Manual for Happiness in Love. - I see you kept all our pictures. - Yes, all of them. No. Even the guest gifts. You kept all of them? Yes! I even kept the boxes, the green ribbons, the confetti candy. Good for you! T have an idea. Put them aside so I can use them as gadgets for the party. - Oh, the party. Yes. - The party. - So, this is your invitation. - For me? - Of course it's for you. - Yes, then. I am marrying in a week. Bring who you want. Whoever you want. Hold still. These are artistic installations. I need strong emotions to create situations on the borderline with reality. Understand? Oh, nice, nice. This work represents the constriction of human nature. The bandages are the pain that is wrapped around it. This city is the last frontier of pain. -T know. - Bravo, very good. So, listen. You are suffering now. You are suffering very much. No, you must express this pain, this suffering. More! More! More! That's it. That's it. You are dying of pain. Bravo, bravo, very good! You are about to die! Sonia! What a shitty evening! Go! Go! Mr. Degli Orti, we can't always do the same thing, with this suicide obsession. Relax. We will come get you. You calm down. Relax. Everything will be okay. Okay, my ass! This work is... Come on, help me. - It's just something! - Right. It is an experiment. I like investigating on human suffering. - Are you happy? - What? - Are you happy? - 1am trying. Okay, but who says that looking for happiness - leads to happiness? - In fact. I am looking for the work that represent all I have inside, anger, disappointment, fear, hope... Yes? - I'm jumping! - What happened? Sit down. Don't worry, don't worry. There is time. - Jacopo, what happened? - Marta's getting married. The slut! We'll discuss it at home. Come down. No, stay up. We'll come get you. No, don't worry. That guy won't move. - I'll introduce you to a friend. - Hi, Jacopo, I'm Sonia. - Sonia who? - Tell him, tell him. - Fruckton. - What? - What? - Tell him. Fruckton! - Why do you want to jump? - Because life is shit. I know life is shit, and if you jumped, you'd be right... You must leave! You must leave! Listen. Wait for us there. We're coming up. No, don't, or I'll jump. Don't come up or I'll jump! You must leave. Do you understand that you must leave? I'll break it... I'll break it... - Let's go up. - Where are you going? You stay here. Don't worry. He'll stay there. No problem. -T'll go. - Where are you going? - Stay here. I'll go. - If she wants to go, let her. How she runs. She went. She went. The girl went. Yes, she went. He's going to jump. No, she went to him, she ran to him. - Sure. What do you mean? - I didn't understand. Your face is familiar, Have we seen each other before? I wouldn't know. How lovely. What is it? - Hunter with dog. - Is it Capodimonte porcelain? - Yes, Capodimonte. - Sonia, forget it. No. I am interested. She is interested, very interested. The girl is very interested. Out of curiosity, why does this man always attempt suicide? Because his ex girlfriend left him. You get dumped and jump? Everyone should be jumping! That's not it. Then she got another boyfriend. - Igor! - What a bitch! It's normal. You break up and date someone else. Should she be alone? - But she abandoned him at the altar. - Jump. - What're you saying? - He won't jump. Jacopo, it is not worth it. Saint Augustine said the measure of love, is loving without measure. - Love. - What? - To who? - "Love". - I didn't understand. - You said "love". I said it? She said it! She said "love" 50 he wouldn't jump, right? - You two were dating, right? - No. Who? Saint Augustine wasn't abandoned in a trash bin when he was born. - We are dating. - Who? You two? We are dating. She is my girlfriend. - Oh, girlfriend? - Yes. Do you mind? No, I'm glad. I'm glad. But if the measure of love doesn't include loving oneself, it means you don't know how to love. Sonia, we came here to save him, not to have him jump! Not necessarily. - We all have our ghosts. - Yes. - And our problems, understand? - Yes. Look how she's embracing him. They are both embracing. She is embracing tightly. But it's to encourage him. Excuse me. Just because you always faint, and you were abandoned in a trash bin, that only you have problems. - 1 do too, if you don't mind! - Have you finished? - Have you finished? - Yes. Have you finished? - When did you say she's marrying? - In a week. Why? No, it's just something. Let's kill the model! - Go slowly. - Slowly! - Go slowly. - Slowly! - Go faster, - Park here! Wait. I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have been here. I shouldn't have come. - Goon. - I shouldn't have come. - Goon! - Yes, go on. I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have come. It was mistake. Socrates said, "The only things one never regrets are one's mistakes". Actually Oscar Wilde said that! Hold it! Shall we go? Are you sure? They'll arrest us for a ruined marriage. As SunTzu said, "When the enemy is united, divide it". Yes. Women are genetically perfect for going to war. Darn it! I'll be right there! Fuck off! - I don't want to go. - Gol - Let's go! - Gol Jacopo! I didn't think you'd come. I wanted to personally congratulate you. It wasn't nice that you didn't return the guest gifts to me! I just wanted to remind you that you didn't show up in church for our marriage. Excuse me. But you didn't even call to find out what happened. While I made contact as soon as [ was able to! In fact, I, too, told him, "Dear, if your former almost wife invited you to her wedding, there's nothing wrong with it." - So here we are. - Is she your niece? No. I am Sonia, his girlfriend. Pleased to meet you. - He is my brother Barnaba. - Federica. - How old are you? - Fifteen. Excuse us if we came in such a hurry. But we have a flight for the Caribbean in a few hours. Jacopo gave me a fantastic villa on the beach. Yes, a small one. It's the present for the child I'll give him in six months. - A child? - Yes, a little one! - Good thing he won at the lottery. - Yes, but a small winning! - Speech! Speech! Speech! - Speech... Love, they're waiting for us to toast. They want you to speech. - Speak. - What? She meant, you speak well and are handsome, Well, modestly speaking, I was a model in Milan. "Ammani". - What? - "Ammani”, "Ammani". You were a "motel" too? - Have a nice evening! - All the best. And compliments for the groom! Will you stop making eyes at that slut? - What're you saying? I only have eyes for you. - Bastard! No. I'm not paying for another marriage! Come on, come on. Go! Go! Go! Are you an idiot? - Thank you. - What a great evening. Are you doing it on purpose? Darn it! Look at this city. What a marvel. - What do they say? See Naples... - And then die. My gosh! Guys, excuse me. I'll be right back. Why does he always go to the ATM to withdraw money? That is the problem! The ATM never gives him money! Also because he doesn't have a cent. If he doesn't, why does he go? He has a theory. He believes that a saint will intervene, and the ATM will give him money, even if his bank account is worse off than he is. Worse off than he is! Anyway... I wanted to thank you. You did something really nice for me, and don't even know me. At times it takes little to recognize a big heart. That, for me, is happiness. Little things. Guys, I am dying of sleep. Let's go, please. Your friend is really tender. - He's not tender. - 1 don't know why, but the fact that he's totally idiotic, irresponsible, and childish, puts me in a cheerful mood. - Barbara is a professional time waster. - Barbara? He lives in a world of his own. He makes strange photos, like him. With an aspiring suicide person like you, you make a perfect couple. But you are right. He puts me in a cheerful mood too. - Shall we leave him here? - No, no. Yes. These photos are lovely. Who took them? They are the photos that Barnaba takes. He says he wants to do a book of photos, but they are ugly. I BUY USED COFFINS Sonia, Sonia, Sonia, wake up! Barnabal - Yeah, Barnaba. - Come here in a hurry. - She fainted. - I know. Go get the salts! - Sonia, Sonia. - I only have big grain salt! - Then get vinegar! - You need to season a salad? I need a strong odor, or she won't come around. Go! - An odor... Here, - What is it? - Your dirty sock. - Idiot! She's coming around. There. Sonia, Sonia! - She always does it. Understand? -I'm fine. I'm fine. - I must be pregnant! - Let's not start, huh? I didn't touch you! - Neither did I. - Idiots. It was just a joke. You wouldn't have a child with me? No, not just one... I mean... Why did you faint this time? Are my photos so disgusting? No. It's the first time I happen to faint with a photo. - But it gave me a great idea. - What idea? Can't you see that she doesn't... I'll explain later. There's just something! Okay, I'm going. - No. Where are you going? - I have to go. - Wait. - I have to go. - Stay with us. - Guys, it was great to be with you, but it's late and I must go. Tomorrow I must get up early - and finish a work. - What? You just fainted. - Five minutes. - Wait. Tell us a bit about yourself. What're you doing? Working on the restoration of a Saint Sebastian and in my free time, I work on an installation project with Barnaba for selections in the Biennale of Contemporary Art. Even if creating this installation and signing up - costs a lot of money. - How much money? - Too much. - How much "too much"? - Ten thousand. - Too much! I always say it. The only solution is winning a lottery. I read that the chances of winning are one in 622,614,630. You think you'll be so lucky? Even if good luck "audax iuvant". But if good luck is helped, who will help us? They say, "God helps those who help themselves. Heaven helps them. So if someone is depressed, the hell that good luck sees you. - Also because good fortune is blind. What a bummer! - Be quiet! Have you finished? That is enough. What're you doing? What're you touching? It's that... Degli Orti, you make mistakes in arranging the files, you do vain attempts at suicide, causing great damages. In recapitulating, if you still want to kill yourself, something I strongly recommend, do it outside this office. - In your home! - It's what I say too. - What? - Something always happens that stops me from doing it. - Come on, do me a favor! - What? - "What"? - You said to do you a favor. - Twill, if you want. - Get out. What're you saying? They made a San Paolo stadium out here. Next time I must find a church in the desert. - What happened? - What church did they bring me to? Good morning, Father. Did you see how well the kids got organized to play? I wonder who gave them the idea and the painting. I have a suspicion. Didn't Jesus say, "Let your children come to me™? But not all of them in front of my church. Let's be serious. When do you plan on finishing this restoration? - Right now! - Finally! - In fact, can you give me a hand? - Certainly. This way. You pull here and you push there. A little more. - Et voila! - Holy Mary! - Oh Lord, the Father! - Sonia, you gave him the syndrome! - Father! - Whois it? You have the Stendhal Syndrome too? No, I have the syndrome that I'll get into trouble. - What did you do? - Get up. Come on. - Easy, easy, easy! - Come on. - It hurts. - Oh, God, Father. Are you hurt? Don't worry. He has a hard head. He won't get hurt. Father, it's an experiment to avoid getting used to classic beauty! One never gets used to real beauty! But one gets used to trash right away. What did you do? Tike it. When I saw it I felt something in my stomach. Me too. Here, in my stomach. See that it arouses something? That's the objective of art. Besides, you know as well as I do, that it is fake. Yes, but it was still a holy work! Saint Gennaro, help me! Speaking of the statue of Saint Gennaro, I wanted to tell you... No, Gennaro, don't worry. I'll protect you! Enough! This is too much. Your work ends here, I gave in many times because I have a good heart, and a lot because of my sister's killer looks. Before the parishioners turn me into a relic in a showcase, please cover that painting and leave this sacred temple. There. I told her, Don't tell me you don't want to pay now? Gennari'l Did you hear that? She even wants money! - Okay, I understand. - Sonial Our mother was right when she said that thing. - What thing? - That you're as... Sonia! - Sonia! Where are you going? - My work here is finished. - What happened? - I can't stay where I'm not appreciated! You mean about the painting? Forget it. Art's something personal. You mean that someone could not like a Caravaggio? No, not that. Listen, Sonia, I'm the least suited to perk people up. I'm going to pack and leaving on the first train. Leaving? And the installation? The Biennale? All that talk about art that is a gift and a curse? Yesterday was the gift, today, the curse. - And us? - Barnaba, it's not true that in Naples it never rains! -It's a lie. The truth is, my father was right. - No. He who has a dream, must be an example to who no longer has any. - Are you happy? - What? Tell me if you are happy. Bye, Barnaba. Take care of yourself, Sonia, wait. Sonia! Okay, don't worry. Everything works out. Wait, Sonial She always makes me run. Sonia! Fuck off. - Yes, registry office. - Jacopo, I'm going back home. Forget the bullshit I told you about loving oneself. And stop trying to kill yourself, You can't do it. Take care. So, let's recapitulate. We said that the letter A stands for "asinine", which you are. While the letter G stands for "great" cuckold. Always him. Oh, I almost forgot! - Sonia, for you. - What is it? They are my savings. 7,500 Euros. I don't know if it's enough. Are you out of your mind? I can't accept. - I'm going back home. - No! What're you doing? You won't move until you participate in the selection, and win. - I made a mistake in coming here. - Sonia, listen to me. Thanks to you and that madman, for the first time in my life I did something I really wanted to do. You have a dream. I never had one. Let me help you. And I am sure everything will be okay. Okay? I shouldn't have filled your head with my madness. - And I'm not so sure of myself. -Tam. Soam1. That's 2,000 Euros. I withdrew money from the box, the offerings box. It is a special occasion. It's just a lot of change! Five hundred Euros are still missing. Five hundred Euros are missing for what? - Why are you here again? - Here. The exact amount. - The ATM? - No. Mother's miracle. You see? In Naples someone always covers you with an umbrella. Thank you. Thank you. Come here. Excuse me. Here. I have to go. I've another thing to do. Goodbye! Hunter with dog. Goodbye, Marta. - Can I get up now? - Not yet. What did you do? Did you move? - What? I'm pretending to be dead. - You ruined everything. Hold still! You never hold still. Who are you? -I'm Pina. - Pina? Why are you here? Now our office will have two vacant places! For direct participation in the Biennale of Contemporary Art the winner is Leon Ardo! Come on. Did you see that work of art there? Leon Ardo. It's cute. It makes me laugh. They have been recommended. Come on, dear, don't worry. What do you care? - 1am really sorry. - Will you stop it or not? - No, a kiss. - We lost. - Enough. - Let's leave him here! IN NAPLES IT NEVER RAINS I knew I shouldn't have participated. Excuse me a minute! Yes! I knew I shouldn't have participated. - I shouldn't have participated. - Yes, Sonia. You shouldn't have. Ten thousand Euros thrown away... Well thrown away. No. You're right. I was stupid, I was wrong. I shouldn't have participated! - Welcome. Insert your card. - Yes. Card identified. Good-day, Mr. Barbara Buonocore. Barbara? It's Barnaba! Make sure you aren't seen by anyone before digiting your pin. - Are you sure you were not seen by anyone? - Yes. Take one last look, and digit the pin number after the beep. Beep! Select the service desired. You selected withdrawal. - Select the amount desired. - One million Euros! - Select a credible amount. - He's an idiot. You selected 250 Euros. Confirm or cancel? Confirm or cancel? - I confirmed! - Thank you. Withdraw the bills. - The bills? Where? - In three, two, one. Withdraw your card. - Goodbye, Mr. Barbara Buonocore. - A miracle! - It's not a miracle. - Then what is it? Kiss me, stupid. I'll explain later. - How did you do it? - I sold your photos. - Didn't you want to do a book? - Yes. Then get your first dedication ready. Onion! Love, I just said "onion". What is it? TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY OF THE NEAPOLITAN CITIZENS IN NAPLES IT NEVER RAINS HE WHO HAS A DREAM, MUST BE AN EXAMPLE TO WHO NO LONGER HAS ANY! YOUR SON SUPER SILENT WASHING MACHINE Let's go. You always think of money. Calm down a bit. - Hi. - Well? You like it? - Dad! - He's dead! The syndrome. Exactly. - Well, did you like it? - Yes. You didn't seem very convinced. Okay, let's toast. What is this apple? No, nothing. It's just something!
