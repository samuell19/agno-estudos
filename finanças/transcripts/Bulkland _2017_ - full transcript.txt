DISTORTED AND TINNY MUSIC This is a dollar store, also known as a discount store, a Pound store, a Euro Store. Everyday shoppers spend billions in Dollar stores. Since 2008 and the GFC our shopping budgets have been slashed and dollar stores have prospered. In the USA the amount of dollar stores has doubled and there are now more dollar stores than pharmacies. It's much the same story around the world. They don't stock any recognisable brands or anything of much value at all. And whether you're in Omaha or Oman... this is where it comes from. China is the world's leading manufacturer of cheap goods and this market in Yiwu is its showroom. In May of 2014 Yiwu exported $77 million US dollars worth of small plastic decorations. $44 million worth of unnamed plastic manufactured products. $36 million worth of imitation jewellery. In one month. It might seem like nothing to buy a cheap plastic toy as a joke or accessories you expect to wear only once. To the people here it's a very serious matter. This is the city the dollar store built. MUSIC RAINDROPS MUSIC Summer, don't forget we have to go to the market to stock plush toys. Try and find a supplier. Gotta be cheap and we need to find generic animals. Like ocean animals is okay. Also gecko. Umm lizard. Any, any animal really. But we can't have anything licensed, okay? And it's gotta be cheap. TRAFFIC AMBIENCE Maybe next month I'll go back to England. Maybe... Whoa! LAUGHTER That happens! As long as it's none of my goods - that's the main thing. MUSIC My name's Nigel. Nigel Cropp. My main job is trading. I have a trading company. We service discount chain, importers, retailers, from all around the world. South America, Australia, Europe. We accompany customers around the market. Sourcing products. In the market there's many booths selling the same thing. Usually I go to 4 or 5. You know what the price is then. We go to the market and the supplier will give us a price. And then we do the ordering. The goods are delivered to my warehouse. And we 'QC' the goods. Which is the most important thing for my job. Quality control. Lot's of people have this bad perception of Chinese goods. CHATTERING The niche I have is that I'm a Westerner. I speak English obviously. And I have the Western eye I know what products are not going to sell, I know the quality expected. It's quite an important thing, I think. Originally I come from a place called Hertford, which is the county town of Hertfordshire. A nice little market town. Lots of nice old buildings and nice pubs. I was living in Melbourne at the time and I started talking to this guy in the pub, an English guy - and he said he was going to go and teach English in Japan. And a few days later I was sitting down and I happened to open a newspaper and on the back page was an advert for a seminar teaching English overseas. I went to the seminar and I thought 'Oh this is great!' Saved up. Did the course, passed the course. And within one week this job in Yiwu came up. I looked on the map and I couldn't find it. And eventually I found where Yiwu was located and it wasn't far from Hangzhou, Shanghai. And it was just a small city. I had no idea of what Yiwu was about. My perception of Yiwu was pagodas, canals, bridges. Y'know? TRAFFIC AMBIENCE Well obviously I got here and it was very different. So I started teaching at this English training centre. And I was teaching adults and they were factory bosses and trading company bosses. So little did they know I was teaching them English but at the same time they were teaching me how to do the business here, how it all worked. I used to do day trips to the Futian markets and they used to show me around. Still today some of those students are my suppliers and we still get on very well. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT SHOPPING MALL AMBIENCE DISTORTED AND TINNY MUSIC SNORING DISTORTED AND TINNY MUSIC PHONE RINGING AND CHATTERING CHATTERING HORN TRAFFIC AMBIENCE SHOPPING MALL AMBIENCE TRAFFIC AMBIENCE MUSIC For Halloween we export witch brooms, and there's one village that will make these brooms. There's a town that just makes wheelbarrows. You go to a town for toys or wooden puzzles or Christmas decorations. Each town has its niche. A lot of the factories they will sub work out to these towns. And they'll be working out of their homes. So when they finish farming on the land they'll come back and they will continue to work. A bit like the cottage industry back in the industrial revolution in England. Where it took Great Britain 200 years it's taken China 20-30 years. But you have to be careful with the quality when they start subbing work out we have to be on our guard. Make sure we check properly and carefully because obviously there might be an issue with the quality. We export jewellery into Europe and even if you're, because we're ordering products from the same villages, workers might change, and the quality of the product may go down. So you can't get complacent. CHILD CRYING CHILD SHOUTING MUSIC TRAFFIC AMBIENCE MUSIC People call me 'The Grey Wolf 'in Germany. "Der Graue Wolf". My name is Marco Tonelli. I had a vision four years ago to produce my own notebooks. Not by some Chinese supplier or German supplier. I came to Yiwu because we were producing notebooks in Germany and the labour costs and all the other costs in Germany were quite high. So we decided to give it a try in China. Come here don't be frightened guys. Read. To find workers we tried several things actually. But in the end we decided to go to the "Labour Market." It's called 'Talent Market' but there's not that much talent so I call it 'Labour Market.' So anybody of you can do this? Yes or no? The most important for them is money and how long they work. So we have to focus on this one too. What has he done before? At least we get a lot of people here. Half the street. Don't worry about that! CHATTERING Yeah, yeah, yeah! And tell him to talk with other people. So when you arrive there the first view of the labour market in Yiwu is horrible. There are homeless people, there are dirty people, there are uneducated people. And after I would say 15-20 minutes we were quite cool with it, and we started really to have interviews on the spot with the people, and actually we found this one guy and he showed us his books what he'd done. And I was really surprised in the end. Photo albums, they're photo albums. In the end they're nice people. So it's good that not every time the first thought is fulfilled. Maybe the cameraman can translate? So I'm happy that I was wrong. TRAFFIC AMBIENCE TRAFFIC AMBIENCE China is a moving country so in every city you have not real Shanghainese or Yiwunese. But you see it from the faces that they are coming from different parts of China. We have different types of foreigners here of course. There are quite rich successful foreigners here. Mostly I think from Arab countries because we have a big Arab community in Yiwu. It's very big. We have a big Russian community here. And we have the rest of the world. So this is Yiwu. Yeah. ISLAMIC MUSIC ISLAMIC MUSIC TRAFFIC AMBIENCE CHILDREN CHATTERING TRAFFIC AMBIENCE TRAFFIC AMBIENCE FAINT MUSIC MUSIC FAINT MUSIC CHATTERING MUSIC MUSIC DJ ANNOUNCEMENT Yiwu was actually a farming village not so long ago. And suddenly this market has just rapidly grown up. Maybe 30, 20 years ago. Very different to what it used to be. The market was just a street market. People started making like Christmas decorations and arts and crafts. More and more people started to come to this market. And that's how it's grown up. Yiwu people have been lucky, they've been at the right place at the right time. Made lots of money. Ah, this is ah... Ling Ling's great great grandmother! Great great grandmother. Uh? 90 years old! She wants me to go and eat something. Upstairs. Okay we'll go upstairs to eat something. You got any cold beer? No cold beer? We only like cold beer. Yes we do. Huh? Uh? London, London, London. In December 2014 Yiwu reached a new milestone with the inauguration of the world's longest railway. The train carried 1400 tonnes of toys for Christmas and crossed Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany and France. Before finishing in Spain. But since then the cracks in the Chinese economy have been exposed to the world. And exports have fallen. Thousands of workers have been laid off, China is moving away from manufacturing cheap goods, and the party in Yiwu is drawing to an end. It's one of the most competitive cities that can be. Because you have this big market you have really big business in Yiwu, everybody's fighting for every RMB here. It's not talking about thousands of dollars, it's for one RMB you have to make fights here. I bought two machines. You have to fight for every goods for every taxi, for every meal. Sounds a little bit strange but it's a jungle here and everybody just wants to make money here and nobody wants to live here and that is why this city is so competitive. Because everybody is aggressive, everybody's out for money. What's the last price? There are there no rules in this city. You see it when they're driving, you see it when they are doing things. I think that's the big difference between established cities like Guangzhou for example and Yiwu. So 'xie xie'. Make the contract, we buy some money and then... If this is not working we give it back to you my friend. You can't make the jobs and the deals what is done here in Yiwu in a city like Shanghai or Guangzhou. You would face really big problems with the government. Here you just have to pay money. So it's really like the wild west in the 18th century in America. Money counts and toughness counts. TRAFFIC AMBIENCE We went to the labour market to get our first workers here, and surprisingly enough we found somebody, which suits our company. CHATTERING Let's talk about money wise. We have the range from $400 a month to $400,000 a month. Somebody could say "I am doing this for $3000 a month." and he's happy. For myself I wouldn't do this for less than $20,000 a month. CHATTERING Having success in Yiwu means not only money. I think having success is being responsible, having your own business, with your own people, taking care of your workers. Making it a little bit different than the Chinese factories, because in Chinese factories Chinese living like animals. My workers will have their own apartments, we are paying more salary and we will take more care of our workers than probably anybody else in the city. And then another week, and then we had, another week's holidays. So it's been a big pain. I know! You know my staff? They all have the Chinese holidays, and because I'm a Westerner, they want to Western holidays. They even ask me for a day off for Halloween! My god! We don't even have that in England! And the Queen's birthday! In England we don't have a holiday for the Queen's birthday. Y'know? They want everything. Take, take, take. Yiwu has a reputation for cheap goods. Obviously the prices in China are increasing and more and more people are looking at other countries for their products. Such as Vietnam, Laos, Bangladesh, India. Because it's cheaper. My wage bill has increased 40-50% in the last three years. The standard of living has gone up and people want to have a better lifestyle, and obviously at the end of the day that will push the price of the products up. LAUGHTER TRAFFIC AMBIENCE FIRECRACKERS TRAFFIC AMBIENCE Here we say every morning is a Monday and every evening is a Saturday, because we are working 24/7 in Yiwu. In an average year I spend six to eight months here in Yiwu. I'm spending the rest of my time in my lovely house with my lovely family in Germany. CHATTERING Two days. Ah, I was asking for the warranty. Three months. No, no! One year! CHATTERING I've never felt home in China. This is because I don't speak the language. You only can feel at home if you can talk with the people and if you can get what you need. You know? Not only food but also respect. I feel more home in Europe, I speak five languages. I'm home in Italy, I'm home in Spain. I've never felt home in China. CHATTERING There are a lot of things I don't like about Yiwu. It's like a jungle here, everybody's fighting for himself. There's no real friendship and it's not a nice city like say Beijing or Shanghai where you have nice places. The whole city is Grey. The quality of life is very bad in Yiwu. In the end it's my dreams keeping me here in Yiwu. I always wanted to have my own factory in China. That's what's keeping me here, I want to have success. Oh shit. Oh shit. Don't swear! Don't copy your dad! I've always felt part of the family. They've always accepted me. I've never felt like that "She's brought a foreigner home!" They've always made me feel very welcome. I've never felt any different. He got it as well! He got it! How'd I meet Jessie? When I started the trading company she had a booth in the market selling bags. And also she was one of my students. Jessie's family, they live in the countryside so sometimes we go and see them. There are many nice places to see in Yiwu. It's not all just factories and buildings. There is actually some nice scenic countryside. I do... I miss back home. Obviously I miss my family and friends. What are they making over there? Nah, I'm alright. Ah okay. LAUGHTER But now the world's a lot smaller. You have Skype, you have all this social media. It's not like you have to write a letter or send photos. And also it's a very happening place. I'm never bored. I never have time to think about my life back home, you know? I'm always doing something, I'm always busy. So these guys... - And hide it? And tomorrow the actor will come and try and find, We'll find out in a minute. Looks like they're gonna do another charge over there with the Japanese army. Two movies going on at the same time. If I don't go back to England or if I don't move to Australia. I could see myself moving to Hangzhou, which is quite near here. I think Hangzhou is a very nice city. It's cleaner. Obviously my wife's from Yiwu, I have a daughter here. I wouldn't have got married to a local person if I thought I couldn't live here. I can't see myself living here for the rest of my life, but Yiwu will always be a part of me. MUSIC
