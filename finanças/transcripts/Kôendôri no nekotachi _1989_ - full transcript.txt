TOEI Company, LTD. Presents Dancer Carmen Junsa Guridon Mama Cats in Park Avenue Starring: OGINOME Yoko IGARASHI Izumi ITO Chieri MARI Yoko MATSUMOTO Iyo SHIOZAWA Toki TOKITA Fujio ISHIBASHI Renji EDOYA Nekotachi Directed by: NAKATA Shinichi Thank you for waiting. Here is a cafe au lait for you. This is your hot coffee. Hi, Carmen. She is so cute. This one is a stray cat. But it has a collar. It must be someone's cat. The owner has poor taste. How are you, Dancer? Carmen. Good morning! I'm envious because Carmen has a nice boyfriend. The cat musical is based on what cats really like to do. We must start by observing them first. Our instructor is so into it, so it'll be tough for me. I don't know if I can be a good assistant. I really want a role as Dancer. You'll get it, Karu. You're very strong-willed. That's my only trait? Pretty much. It's time to go. Wait a minute. Mayumi. Good morning! What did you buy? Some sandwiches. Can I have some? No way! Should I lose some weight to show more flexibility? I guess. About five pounds, you think? That's not bad. I have to lose 12 pounds. What if out me? You have to eat more, Mayumi. Yumi set a new record the other day. But I want to go again. You just have to show me the pictures. Hey, Dancer. Sorry for being so late. Please help us, OK? We're starting. Spread out. Sit down. Please start stretching. One, two, three, four... It's a stretching exercise. Don't slack off. You can't be seen on stage like that. Well... Just imagine a city without any cats. Not just cats. Without any dogs or birds. If there are just us humans, what do you think? Karu? I wouldn't like that. It's sad. It's rather scary. Without them, we won't be able to live, either. Please remember that image and work for this show. Don't slack off. Please continue. I can act like a cat. Meow! Wow, it's big. We'll be performing on this stage. Let's try to dance using the whole stage. Where did you come from? I'm with the modeling agency that is nearby. You're a nice looking girl. We're making a new drama. We've been looking for a girl like you. Would you like to tryout? I'm fine. Really? That was a quick decision. No. No, thank you. Our office is very close. What? Go away! Please stop it. What are you doing to me? You're a strange girl. I just tried to kick the stray cat. Good morning. I finished the draft. Junsa. Sorry for entering without permission. I had nowhere else to go. This cat led me to this building. I'm so sorry. Good morning, Guridon. What's wrong? You seem to lack energy today. I know I won't get a role. I'm good at singing, but... You're young. You can still tryout. Everybody says that. Guridon, I'm so envious of you. Guridon is having a hard time surviving, too. I'll announce the casting. All the true cat lovers will be performing. Please don't hold a grudge against each other just because you didn't get the part that you wanted. Karu will be playing the boss cat, Dancer. Hang in there. Yumi will play his girlfriend, Carmen. Dancer's rival, Black, will be played by Miyako. The musician, Guridon, will be Mayumi. Me? You don't like it? Yes, I love Guridon. The next one is Junsa. Her name is Hanamura Chiyo. She just came from Hokkaido. She gets the role as Junsa. Please be nice to her. What kind of cat is Junsa? Junsa appeared out of nowhere six months ago. He's been watching this town from everywhere. That's why we named him "Junsa" (a police officer). He is a cat police officer. Shibuya is a dangerous town. Don't worry about a thing. The instructor says funny things sometimes. He is just like you, it means. Look. I found him. It's Junsa. Thanks for your hard work. Please be there for us. He looks kind of like you. Mr. Seki made a good decision. That's right. Observe him, and study hard. "He has a sweet face during the day "But he becomes too dangerous at night. "In the dark city, "someone blows a whistle. "The more dangerous you are, "the more attractive you look. "Hold me tonight. "In a telephone booth in a dark alley, "I feel like someone is staring at me. "I feel so attracted but don't know what to do. "He is too cute to resist. "It's so dangerous. "I know I shouldn't be here, but I can't leave. "I'm not lying. "Let me go now. "When you look at me, I can't resist. "He has a kind face, but he'll growl at you soon. "Before anything happens, "please let me go now. "Hurry, hurry!" "My heart beats so fast, but it's not love. "It's not a true love. "Let me go now. "It's just a dangerous trap. "It's a dangerous night. "I'm not lying. "It's a dangerous night. "When you look at me, I can't resist. "It's a dangerous night. "Hurry, hurry!" There you go. Thanks. Your clarinet is the best. It makes me feel better. I'm getting older, though. My fingers are not moving so well. Why don't you join us? What? Our musical. I'll have Rie talk to our director. That's impossible. Why? All the cat lovers got together for this musical. If I can act as Guridon, you'll be really good in the show. I just love cats. But I don't know much about them. Oops. I have to go now. Bye, Guridon. I'll give you back to him. It's lesson time. Hang in there. Bye. Bye. There you go, Guridon. Guridon, it's yours. Stop, Guridon. It's just a cat. I panicked. Is he okay? Should we take him to the hospital? That's right. Guridon. Don't worry about it. Let's go. Sorry. Hey, get in the car. There are many cars are piling up behind us. Let's go. It's just a stray cat. Hey. Get in the car. Get in the car. Go home. It's done. His bone are okay. He has some minor bruises. He'll be better. I'm glad. Thank you. The cashier is that way. Guridon. You can go now. Your boyfriend must be waiting for you. I don't care about him. He was surprised and panicked. Don't say that. Please go back to him. I can't keep this cat in our apartment. I wish I could keep him. Cats want to live free. They don't want to be kept inside. It's the best way to live in this town. Mr. Yukimura. It's 9,800 yen. I'll pay for it. Don't worry about it. I want to pay for it. Why don't we split it in half? Would you like stuffed animals? Aren't they very cute? They'll make perfect gifts. This one is the cutest. "When you search for a new lover, "you have to be really sharp. "Our good ears work perfectly for that. "We need wellness, happiness, and loneliness. "We need vacations, romance, and gourmet tours. "It's not a joke. "I really want to be loved. "Wait, wait a minute. "Our world is filled with freedom. "We love cats. We love cats. "Even if we are reincarnated. "We love cats. We love cats. "I want to be a stray cat again. "We love cats. "We love cats. "We don't go to school. "We love cats. "We love cats. "This town teach us everything." Hello. You're late again. I'm paying you to be here on time. I have to go shopping now. Kaoru, get back and study. Marilyn's dinner is late by 10 minutes. I'm so sorry. You think you should just apologize. Sorry, Marilyn. I already prepared dinner for Marilyn. Marilyn. You must be so hungry. I want to do everything on time. I'm so organized, and I am always on time. There you go, Sweetheart. Let's eat. Excuse me. Why aren't you eating? Why? You must be sick. Did you take her outside? Those stray cats have germs. Please call the doctor. You didn't even wash your hands. You're so dirty. I have to go now. The stray cat, again. He tries to play with my Marilyn all the time. You're so dirty. Go away. Dancer. You have some cats in this parking lot. Do something! You don't like cats? You're just using your arms. Move your whole body! Dance to the rhythm. Use your bottom. You suck! You should quit. Let's take a break. There you go. You can't learn the whole thing all at once. Miyako was like you, too. Dancer is always cool whatever he does. He is the boss. That's right. I can't do it. I can't catch up with Karu. Get up! Leave me alone. I don't like this. What are you saying? This is our performance. We have to do it. Don't give up. It's a fight. Dancer. "I was born in an alley. "It was a sweet tune like my mom's lullaby. "My lullaby was the town's rock music." "A midnight traveler bites his lips. "Don't talk, just look at me. "My arms are up because I'm a loser. "I can dance on guardrails. "I don't know what I should say to you. "I'm puzzled because of you tonight. "For you, I'll turn my body around. "Shake your little body. "Shake your little body. "Shake your little body. "Shake your little body. "Shake your little body." Junsa, come on. What's wrong? I don't want to dance anymore. You've got the role. You have to dance for us. Karu, can you start over again? Rie, why do you force us to practice? I'll never become a good dancer. I'm not cool like Yumi or Miyako. I'm not strong-willed like Karu. You're acting selfish. You don't get it because you don't have to dance. I can't direct a show if I don't know anything about dancing. Your cat, Junsa, is not like you. He always keeps an eye on everyone. Wait a minute, Rie. It's Chiyo's toughest time. I can't believe you're quitting just because you can't dance. We're trying to express something by dancing. We can't say things directly. I don't know anything about dancing or cats. I have to find something I really love. Stop it. I really don't like to leave things unfinished. Both of you. You don't have to say it like that. I really hate it. You just went too far. Chiyo, where are you going? I'm leaving. OK. We don't need Junsa. But... Karu, do it right! Hey, do it right! But this show won't be the same without Junsa. Don't worry about it. I'll make it work. Yumi. You can't act as Carmen if you're jumping like that! I can't do this! Today is my last day. Why did you start this all of a sudden? Why do we have to listen to our director? I want to dance as I like. But we've been practicing for this show. Hey, Yumi. Do you remember when we went to the theater? Our dream was to dance in that theater. It's funny you give up on your dream so easily. What happened to you, Yumi? I can't dance as Mr. Seki wants. You're doing it right. I like it. As I always say, we just have to dance like stray cats. We're cats, too. "Tears of a lonely girl. "Nobody understands me. "Even my dress looks sad. "Someone comes to me "and takes my hand for a dance. "You had a dirty pair of shoes. "I remember the initials on them. "Dance with me. 'I'm glad that I met you. "Please watch me grow. "Dance with me. "With my innocent heart, "I'll keep chasing my dreams. "You're my love, forever." "Memories... I've lost some. "There is a rainbow on this map. "Melody... "We used to make songs. "One more time... "I want to see you smile. "I miss you so much. "I don't want this to become a memory yet. "One more time... "One more time... "I really want to dance with you right here. "My heart doesn't stop racing. "I don't want this to become a memory yet." Dancer! They're starving. We have a lot more. They're so cute. They really are. Dancer and Junsa. We'll take care of the kittens, so don't worry about a thing. Which one should I get? Can you pick one out for me? Well... I recommend this product very much. It's easy to operate and is very reasonable, too. What's that? He is so cute. Kick him out. Where did your mother go? You guys are so cute. Why don't we name them? Well, you look like Guridon. So, your name will be Guridon Jr. Chiyo. Is that you, Chiyo? Hey, where are you going? Chiyo! Chiyo! Wait! I thought something wonderful would happen in Tokyo. Because everybody looked so happy. Did you find something you want to do? Not yet. I like to dance, but I think I can find something else. But you don't know what it is yet? Right. In that case, why don't you dance with us until you find it. Without Chiyo, Junsa looked so sad. Junsa has to be in our musical. Mr. Seki. Our kitten police officer just came back. Change your clothes. We've already started. Karu, you, too. Yes, sir. Welcome back. Is that you, Guridon? Good morning, Guridon. How are you today? What's wrong? Wait for me, Guridon. Wait. Mr. Yukimura. How are you feeling? Mr. Yukimura. Yes. He is awake now. Mr. Yukimura. You're okay. Guridon showed me where you were. Thank you, Guridon. I was saved because of you. Rie, can you take me somewhere new next time? Sure. I wish we had more time. What's wrong? Rie, what's going on? Explain it to me. I'm not paying for you to do this. You're like a thief. Do you understand? Kaoru, let's go home. It's not your fault. I know that for a fact. Come on. Marilyn. Marilyn. What? Marilyn is with the dirty stray cat. Stop it, Kaoru. Stop it. Marilyn is dirty now. Let's throw her away. I can buy you a better cat, okay? It's the best thing we can do for cats. What? Even if you give her gourmet food and dress her nicely, she is miserable inside if she isn't free. You're like a street punk. This town doesn't need stray cats or punks. You and Marilyn have to go now. What are you looking at? Come here. Throw the cheap toy away. I'll get a cute kitty for you. What's this on my head? What's this? You're responsible for this. I've been trying to make Shibuya the cleanest town for 30 years now. You've agreed with me once. Did you forget about it? I have enough money. Please do it right. Okay? I see. Sorry for my mistake. We turn everything into profit. This is how Cat Busters do their work. Why are you all here? Rie. Rie. The kittens are here. They are. What happened? I don't know. What happened to you? You're so wet. You must be freezing. It's raining outside. You'll catch a cold. Let's have some warm milk. I'll check on them. OK. Our customers are everything. Our cats are everything. With this money, you can buy another golf course. Your company will get a lot of money from this, too. Your company policy is to make this town clean again. You collect a lot of money from the innocent citizens. Then, you even sell the captured cats. We're in Shibuya. Some stray cats are good ones. I captured some of the housecats, too. I like that. There are so many of them. They're cute. This one looks so elegant. We can sell this one for a high price. Boss, I'll give you 50,000 yen for it. You're a good businessman. Karu. Karu. What's wrong? What's on your mind? Tomorrow is opening day. You have to focus. Yes, sir. Let's start over from the beginning. Have you seen Guridon? He must be on a gourmet tour. He must be enjoying some salmon from Hokkaido. I think he's having some crabs there. Hey, I'm serious. I don't see Dancer, either. Good morning. Wow, that's hard. Hang in there. Size Age Color Breed Luster Health Pedigree Medical History No. Burn it. No. Burn it. No. Burn it. Turn it on! It's on. It'll be your turn soon. You're so cruel. We're doing really well. Don't climb on the fence. There is a cat. He is so cute. Come on. Come to me. It's dangerous there. He'll fall. Where is he going? Wow, good job! I'll announce this week's sales profit. We sold many many cats! You have to know how to spend your money. This is how we get more profit. There you go. She is a Persian cat and is about four years old. Yes! Treat her nicely, okay? This one is a housecat. Is it bad? I think so. What's going on? Oh, it's a cat. Why is it up there? Are you okay? It's an emergency! All the cats are escaping from the facility. Hey, what's going on? I'm afraid of cats! Don't let them go. Stop it! No! We won't let you escape, but we won't kill you. Busters, go! Stay still. I got one. Be quiet. Stupid cats. Stay still. I'll kill you! How is this? Are you going to listen to me now? Don't come near me. You can't. Sakagane Kaoru has a lot of money. Do you understand? I can't do this. My legs are shaking. All my relatives came from my hometown. Take it easy. Perform as we practiced. Everything will be okay. Please get ready now. Yes. Karu, do your best. It's strange. What? Dancer isn't here. It's for them. You're right. I wanted them to see it. "Just like many fish live in the river, "many cats live on the street. "When the cats are gone from the town, "that's when the town dies. "You can't wipe off your tears with a windshield wiper. "Tears fall onto your heart. "Tears gently wet a pavement of my heart. "Cats cry, too. "Cats cry because they're cats. "That's why they can smile the next day. "People live in a nice town with some adorable cats. "The refreshing breeze and the gentle sunlight... "In this town, "many cats sing, dance, love, and live."
