On the double! Stop! Stand at ease! Attention! Regiment, on the double! One! One! - Are you hungry? - Yes! Eat! BREAD PRODUCTS Keep your head down! One! On the double! - One! - One! Stop! Stand at ease! Come here! Attention! Regiment, on the double! Go! - One! - One! At ease! In your bedrooms! Bread! Bread! Bread! Where is the money? Tell me where the money is! Tell me where it is, don't act stupid! I saw you meeting the man delivering bread. You talked to him and he taught you bad things. And now he's sending you money. Tell me where it is! Listen, if you don't share it with me, I'll kill you. Understood? I know how to kill people. The priest says to share with poor people. And I'm poor. Understood? If you don't decide by tonight to share it with me, I'll kill you! Because I know how to kill people. Because I've killed people before. Damn you little brats. How are you? Do you have a gum? - One! - One! In your bedrooms! I can't see! Come back, you can't run away! Get off the fence! Go! Down! Come to me! What are you doing here? How did you get... Hello! I'm talking to you. How did you get here? God, I messed up the traffic. What am I gonna do with you? I don't have time for this. Make time! - What? - Can I come with you? Come with me? Where? So I'll come with you. You're coming with me? How old are you? Hey! I asked how old you are. We're the same age. All right. So how old? I told you. What do you mean? What do you mean, "what do you mean"? Let's say… You have memories and I imagine them. Yeah? Who is Tanta? It's Tanţa. I didn't have money for the comma under the T. I was young and stupid. And you stayed young and stupid. Hey! Be careful! I'll beat you up! - Ioşi! - Ioşi! What, you don't have money? Ioşi! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Look over there! Look, he came. - Anything in the piggy bank? - Nothing. Come on, get in. The motor's running. Damn you lazy people. Get in! Get in already! I can't take it anymore. Medicine costs me money, and you're not making any. - Who's that? - New girl. - Virgin. - What? She came before us. I told her... Shut up! Do you accept food stamps? How are you, doll? Whose girl are you? Who brought you here? With mom… with dad… at a picnic. What are you doing here? - Where am I supposed to go? - The highway is big. This is my area. - I didn't know. I'm leaving. - Hey! You're leaving… What are you doing? Do you love me? Good. You paid for your bed. You still have to pay for food. I know this face. I know you. - I don't think so. - Yes, I do. - You go to football matches? - No. No! You go to the theatre! You're in magazines! - I don't know. - Yes, you do. What do you know? I pay taxes, VAT! Move, you damn bitch. I'm not stealing from the state, why are you stealing from me? Move, time is passing Years are passing, mother and tramps… Go! Go in. Everyone out! You damn whores. Get off! Amateurs! The intention to legalize prostitution disgusted church representatives. They requested Parliament remove the agenda of the legislative initiative drafted urgently after the arrest of a large network of pimps. The arrests took place after an investigative journalist from our channel infiltrated the prostitutes in North Bucharest. THE PIMP "BAROSO" ARRESTED THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY Get the hell out of here! After Baroso was arrested, the girls went back on the streets looking for new clients, but they're afraid that without protection they can fall victims to the sexually dangerous. Police! Let's tell this to the girls on the highway who live the way Miss Ema showed us in tonight's report. People are free to choose. God showed us two paths, and they chose the path of sin. CHURCH SAYS NO TO PROSTITUTION! Oh Mighty God. Our church defends human dignity. And the family institution. Thank you for coming. I thank our viewers as well. Good evening. THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY Jerks and idiots… Jerks and idiots everywhere! - Bravo, you're an angel. You can... - Get out! I said, get out! Jerks and idiots… - Miss Ema? - I'll be damned if I ever risk my ass for a story. All the idiots on the show and the morons watching it. Miss Ema... If you came here to tell me how great the show was, how proud you are and so on, get out of here. No, Mr. Ricu Făinaru told me to tell you he's waiting for you. Very well. I'm not married to him. That's why he is a director. He can wait. But he said he wants you now. - Seriously? - Yes. - Now? - Yes. - Do you want to go instead of me? - Yes, if I need to. How romantic. Anything else? Leave the phone with the secretary. I'm not sure you know Mr. Deputy Ispas. - Well… - Good evening, Ma'am Ema. Who doesn't know Mr. Deputy Ispas? Look. That guy's done your face good. I did it good myself, that guy just hit me. What happened to you, Ma'am Ema? Tell me why you asked for me. Look, Mr. Deputy Ispas, in the capacity of his position as Chairman of the Environment Committee, wants to launch a campaign in favor of green energy. Cheap, clean, renewable. Aha. He wants to launch this campaign on your show. - Go on. - He'll pay commission, everything. Is it advantageous for us? Yes, 10% of 200,000. On contract. - What does this 200,000 cost us? - What does it cost? Nothing, I pay. Nothing. Ispas does nothing for free. Do you do anything for free, Ma'am Ema? - Tell me, Ricu, what am I missing? - What are we missing? Nothing. This is about humanity, progress, civilization. Like you give a damn about the good of humanity. I understood we have to do it. That's it. Shake on it. Ispas will help me with the documentation. Two shows. The money? I'll take care of that. I'm impressed. He might make it to External Affairs. I won't keep you anymore. No need to see each other again. Please hurry the decor guys so we can be ready in time. Thank you. Good evening, Ma'am Ema. Maybe we launch the new design for the Deputy's show. - Thank you, Ema. - That's your business, Ricu. This broad doesn't listen to anyone? It's the hormones! And you? Do you know what she meant by External Affairs? No. Pay on time. Of course. Does she understand what this is all about? Do you know who she is? She invented the alphabet with numbers. Do you get it? I don't understand. What's important is that we're both good. All of us. Did you really believe that? Beads. You didn't behave. Something bad will happen to you one day. Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? - Should I call someone? - No. You need a doctor. I need to move. And leave the cat alone, you're gonna break it. You're not taking care of yourself at all. Good evening, Miss Ema. This way. Thanks. - Hello, Ema! - Don't you dare! Who's that? She's a trainee. I'm trying her on, as they say. Really? And does she fit you? Not too small? - Or is she prêt-à-porter? - No, she is an investigative reporter. - Obviously. Does she have a name? - Yes. - Velvet…? Velvet Popa. - Popa. And what does Velvet investigate? She brought us a hidden camera report. Shocking interviews with great images. A wheat ship, Panama flag, no invoice. Chop-chop! Enters the Port of Constanţa no one sees it on paper, no one registers it. After… chop-chop! It migrates. Emigrates to warm countries, like the birds. Do we have birds in the show as well? Should I show you the rundown? Don't be rude. Say who's coming. A Secretary of State for Agriculture and an industry billionaire. Băniţă accepted immediately. Obviously, Băniţă never refuses if it's in his interest. - Pârvan? - Pârvan… …he said he's going to another show. - Pârvan? - Yes. Phone. Pârvan! Hello, Pârvan? No time for pleasantries. Are you dancing with us or changing partners? I know you don't want people seeing you in the same jacket for the third time. They'll think you're at the end of the line, living hand-to-mouth. Go get yourself a Hugo Boss from the Chinese and we'll pay for it. You can ask, we'll see what you get. What freaking invoice? Do you want to get cut into pieces? I won't take your time. You're busy. See you tomorrow night. Listen… - I went to the big boss. - So is he sending you to the field? No, I'm serious. First he beat around the bush but then he told me that the audience fluctuates. We're third place. He was very angry. Tell Gruber to change the clappers. Bring more flowers, we need more color in here. Or not. Or yes. Let me think about it. The new decor is here in a week, we'll deal with the audience then. - Tell me if Ricu got here. - He's upstairs in the production room. Ricu! - Yes! - I'm coming upstairs. Well, come! Why are you standing here? Don't you have work to do? - I do. - Get out of my face. - Good afternoon, Miss Cerchez. - Hi, Adi. - Does she always treat you like this? - Who? This one… This is how frigid girls are. No humor, but... Turn that shit off. Sorry Miss Ema. Dragoş! - God, Ema, I love you like my own mother. - Go fuck your mother. Snap! - Hi, Ricu. - Hi, love. Who's this extra? Who brought her? What's up with you, Ema? Who? That one! Vâlcu. If I told you Vâlcu brought her, would you be happy? If I tell you that her dad is big in Services, would you be happier? Are we gonna treat her nice? Ricu is begging you. Is she any good? Straighten up. - I don't know. Dragoş says she's good. - Dragoş says a broom is good… If it has big boobs and a bit of ass. - You're something else. - That's why our ratings don't go up. Because your forcing all these connections on me. - Connections after connections. - Yes. So what? - I went to see the decor. - You're changing the subject. - It's not ready. - No, it's not. It will be. We started late. - Are we moving in a week? - I don't know. Others put in the money, we put in flowers. Please, Ricu. - And you also need to tell them we need... - Please, Ema. That's not your business. - There's no time. - Make time! What do you want me to do? Hello? Can you speak? Please talk to me. Hello? Who are you? I read somewhere… Is it true you don't have children? I need a good massage. I'd appreciate you focusing on what you're doing. But still, a child… Or two… A child is a gift for a woman. I don't have any, and I don't want to. No children and no small talk. Yeah? Please. Thank you. - Are you crazy? - Are you ready? - Dănuţa, leave us alone for a bit please. - Sure. - God! - What do you say? Dreamy! Isn't it a little bit sober? Sober? What are you talking about? I have a guy who has a shop at his house, everything you want. On order. Some tanned people get his supplies. Only France and Italy. And food. Only a quarter of the price. What do you say? Are you in? - Have you lost your mind? - Why? I don't know. I'm thinking what Ema will say when she sees you. What will she say? Delightful. How much was this? It's not gold, just a thick coat. Thick. Thick. It's a Philip Patrick. A thousand euros with the watch included. God, life's hard. Ioana, are you eavesdropping? Hi! - Good day. - Take a seat. Do you know what a blonde says when she finds out she's pregnant? God, I hope it's not mine. I sold a big one, you know? I sold a fodder wheat boat as big as the fucking Titanic. At the price of baking wheat. - Bravo, you're covered. - Well, not really… I have so much wheat leftover that I can shove it up my ass. Will you help me? You want me to buy a few wagons? Will you help me out? Put your phones away. Everyone put it on silent or turn it off. What is he doing? Come to the Ministry tomorrow, we'll talk then. What time? In the morning. COMMERCIAL BREAK Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to welcome the Queen of Live TV, Ema Cerchez. THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY Good afternoon. Thank you for coming today. Did you know Ispas is the President of the Environment Committee? Of course. Why am I always the last to find out? I don't know. Look, he came by… He wants two shows to promote green energy. I mean, if you agree. Yes, of course. It's an idea for the future. And a strong one. Yes. He says it's clean, renewable. Anyway, I take his word for it. It's approved. …discovered by the DADA TV reporters in the Port of Constanţa. They caught on tape the unloading of 60,000 tons of fodder wheat on the Histria Diamant ship that was under the Panama flag. The wheat reached the silos of billionaire Dancu Băniţă. The same trucks were filmed while bringing for loading bakery wheat for export. At the request of DADA TV, port administration officials stated that in the records there is no information about the Histria Diamant carrier in Constanţa berth. More than that, billionaire Dancu Băniţă did not request the necessary approvals for the export of wheat. According to specialists, fodder wheat is twice as cheap than bakery wheat, and the damage caused amounts to several million euros. I've been framed! I have papers and witnesses. I'll send you the papers tomorrow! Never in my life have I sold fodder wheat for bakery! That would be a crime! The video we've just watched with our viewers contradicts you blatantly. What do you think, Mr. Pârvan? I can't imagine there are people like this in Romania. WHEAT WORTH MILLIONS Tomorrow I will ask for the forming of a control committee to analyze and verify what was stated. After a commercial break, you'll have half a minute each to draw conclusions. - Commercials, please. - Shame! After this terrible framing ma'am, no one will ever come here. Take these wires off me! Take these away! Fast! - Mr. Băniţă… - Fuck off! Soon, the biggest wind farm in Europe. For the future of our children, we invest in aeolian energy. In Romania, the wind of well-being is blowing. Green energy, no pollution, cheap for you. Three, two, one, we're on! UP TO HIS NECK IN WHEAT We're back live with Mr. Pârvan. We apologies, Mr. Băniţă had to leave. On the line we have Mrs… Elena Ghiţiu from Mangalia. Good evening. - Good evening. Miss Ema? - Yes, I'm listening. Miss Ema, this green energy you you talk about so nicely in your show is it related to the Buzalac plateau? I'm listening. EMERGENCY COMMITTEE Why don't you tell people about the Scythian tombs which have been destroyed for those wind turbines? I wanted to say that you are all depraved for supporting them. You're stepping on our history. Hello? Yeah, we either lost the connection, or the lady got lost. I advise her next time to practice beforehand. I advise those who hired her to hire younger eyes with good diction. Unfortunately, we're out of time. Thank you for coming Mr. Pârvan. Goodbye, see you next week with a surprise format of the show, The Scandal of the Day. Thank you. And enjoy your jacket. On behalf of the Law University, I warmly congratulate the graduates of the French-Romanian Legal College. I declare you graduates of the Faculty of Law of the University of Bucharest. I imagine it's nice to have an ambassador dad. Takes you from one country to another. I mean, wherever he is sent. You have no time to settle, to meet people. They don't know you either. True, pros and cons. But there are plenty of beautiful things, you know. Here… Duty calls… sorry. - When is he leaving Romania? - In a month. Perfect, we should celebrate. Dad, don't start again. His only good trait is his father. American ambassador, otherwise… Didn't you see he's wearing a bracelet? Give me a break. I'm leaving with him. Of course, we're leaving together. - Leaving together? - No? Ema… Look into my eyes. Ioşi… Why are you doing this to me? For your own good. I've always wanted what's best for you, haven't I? The best… That's what you wanted… Yes. I offered you a life. What do you think America will offer you? What will America offer to us? Illusions, my love. Illusions. Watch out. - Would you like to order? - Of course. Do you want anything? Give me a light. What are you doing, my love? How do you feel? - I can hear music. - It's not the world I know. I feel like a servant. Ema, I'm sorry I can't help you. - Look, the driver is here. - Ok, have a good trip. - Are these the only ones left? - Yes. Wait. Come on. With joy. I know it's difficult. But it's the best decision. I'm just sorry it had to be like this. - Just let it ring. - Please, just a moment. Hello. Yes, it's me. Doctor, can I please see him? Is he going to be fine? Please! Mr. Cerchez, your father I suppose, suffered a very bad accident. - Just one chance... - Did he die? - Did he die? - Please wait for me in the room. The young lady in the passenger seat died. - What young lady? - He is stable. But we need patience. He had a driver. I need to tell you something. We had to amputate his leg. What? That was the only option. I took this decision together with Prof. Modrican. He performed the surgery. Can I see him? That's the room. ROOM 1 You can go in. - I'm sure he'll need you. - Thank you. - Hello? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. I've done some transcripts for you. Listen to them. Choose what you need and I'll bring the rest. Thank you for coming. How are your children? Good. Emigrating. I watched your show. And I have some information. What's at stake? Millions. Hundreds of millions. And where is it going? In the wind. - Clean wind. - And where else? An extension of the wind farm. Green energy with German investment. Powerful men with big interests. Men from our family? I have a few names. Senators, deputies. Sounds promising. They want to build… This whole project on some Scythian tombs in Dobrogea. At Buzalac. I've heard about Buzalac, wind turbines.. Did you hear? Congrats. I'm not surprised. I pulled a lot of strings so no one knows what's there. The press has to shut up. And money. A lot of money. I need more information. Names, traces. I already know what you've told me. It's not enough. - Are you in a hurry? - Big time. Our show will start a campaign to support the project. I don't want to get my hands dirty again before washing them. - Give me a bit more time. - All right. Thanks. He will be out of the office. Forget the connection to the press, Mr. Minister. I'll meet you tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. and we'll discuss all the details. Yes. Yes, sure. Good day. Good day. Fuck yourself. Ioşi! I told you not to sneak into this house like a thief. This dog has no God. Are you by yourself? I let the poor woman leave, she was in terrible back pain. I saw your show. You were amazing. You knocked him out like in a boxing match. Steady, steady until the final hit. Tell me, did you work him from above or… Did it fall in the middle? I'm so sick of these good-for-nothings… If it weren't for them, we'd starve to death. - And what, are we doing badly? - Like hell! I want a drink. Do you? Sure, my love. Let's have a drink. And now… What's next? Are you preparing something? There's a vile guy… Ispas… Who courts us to cover his investment in a wind farm. Extraordinary! Ispas… I know this guy. - You? You know him? - Well, yeah. I met him in Parliament. He tried to talk to me a few times, but… I avoided him. He had big funds in his hands. Of course, not directly, you know… He is well established and supported in politics. Listen. For money… He would do anything. I'd like to know what the connection is between him and the wind turbines. I'll take care of it. Give me a bit of time. It would be useful. It's late. I'm not going home. I'm staying here. Let's go inside. I got tired. The weather is changing, and the prosthesis is bothering me. Have you been for a physical lately? You look a bit weak. I'm not happy about it. I gave up having children. But I wait for heirs. Keep waiting. Good morning. Morning. What, you didn't sleep well? So-so. I think I drank too much whiskey last night. Thanks. I have something for you that will make you happy. I made a few phone calls and… You need to talk, or send someone… There is a professor in archeology called… Dumitraş. Do you know him? Apparently there are Scythian tombs at Buzalac. This Dumitraş knows more about it. You need to talk directly to him. But you know better. I knew I could come to you. Thank you so much. Don't worry about it. Mother… Miss Ema… I discovered the graves. And with some complex digging, I guarantee you that an important page in history can be opened there. And how come no one has known about this until now? I flagged it, but no action was taken. More than that, I officially requested stopping the excavations. Unfortunately, they haven't stopped. Professor… Please, I insist. You have to. You have to come to the show and explain to the people what is really happening at Buzalac. Come on, Grivei wants to see it again. Got it. Okay. It's me. I can feel that. - I need you tonight. - All right. I want you to close your eyes. - You want me to die? I don't get it. - No. It's about the wind farm project. It's a big pile of bullshit. They want to build it on a Scythian settlement from the 5th century. Ema, where do you come up with these? You'll find out tonight. I convinced the guy who discovered the vestiges, an academic, Dumitraş. He'll be live. It's exactly what we need. And the wind farm ad needs to be removed. If you took the money, give it back. I gave it to Vâlcu. Ricu, if we don't start it, others will. This show is exactly what we need. It's gonna be huge. Trust me! Is there anyone, please? Wait a bit. I'll let you know. Do you trust me? I do. If you gave it to Vâlcu, I'll fill the hole. You'll fill the hole… I'll do it on my own risk, I just need you support me. It's gonna be crazy. Trust me, Ricu. Good, woman. Do it. Thanks. You could have kissed me. Ready. Go on. Two, ten. Can you hear me? Soundcheck. - In the hole? - That's where the company is. Giani, turn it on a bit, so she can see. One, two. Can you hear me? This table is scratched. We don't need it. Giani, take it away from here. Guests? We confirmed all the guests except… - Is the cage holding? - Yes, of course. Call them and tell them they're not in tonight. Can it hold three girls? Yes, it has elevator cable. What do you mean they're not in? Call, apologize and tell them that. What are you doing here? Get out of here! Wait, what are you talking about? Who is the guest? How... Prof. Dumitraş, who is a doctor of archaeology, and two academics. We're talking about Buzalac tonight. About Buzalac? Give me the phone. Why are standing there? Do something. Give us a hand. Hello! Good evening, Mr. Deputy. This is Dragoş Staicu from DADA TV. I wouldn't bother you, but I think you need to know. There's been a change of schedule for tonight at The Scandal of the Day Ema Cerchez wants to bring Prof. Dumitraş live. She wants a scandal about the wind turbines at Buzalac. Tonight, yes. She's already changed the rundown. Yes. Yes, with respect. Goodbye. Hello. - Direttore… - Mr. Deputy Ispas, what a surprise. Someone called me. They called to tell me that tonight they'll have live someone called Dumitraş, who will say that there are all sorts of things happening at Buzalac. Anyway… big blow! But it hits everyone. - That's not possible. - But it is. So get ready to clean up your own mess. I really don't care what bribe you give or to whom… I deeply regret this, you know. Do you know how much I care about your regrets? That won't solve the problem. So before you crash, if you're not capable of doing it by yourself, put it on autopilot. Hello? Are you still there? Now that we solved this problem, I'm asking you, dear, have you submitted the file for the extension of the broadcasting license? It would be a shame. But see, it might be too late now. Do you understand? THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY Nina… Schedule a videocall with everyone tonight. ARCHEOLOGIC DISCOVERY IN DOBROGEA THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY SPECIAL GUESTS: DR. DUMITRAŞ, PROF. CUZESCU, DR. CONRATH Good evening. Thank you so much for coming. Good evening. DR. DUMITRAŞ'S PERSONAL ARCHIVE Remains dating from the 5th century were brought to light eight years ago by the academic Aleodor Dumitraş. By Government decision funding and conservation were obtained for these invaluable vestiges. The next government decided to stop investing, and the Eoinvest concern showed interest for the land concession. That's how the construction of the biggest wind farm in Europe started at Buzalac. There are many senators and deputies involved in this business. WIND FARM ON ANTIQUE TOMBS THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AVOIDS AN OFFICIAL RESPONSE MORE THAN 300 TURBINES ARE UP Why are they not taking the turbines somewhere else? Because the wind blows there constantly. Without stopping. NATIONAL TREASURE ABANDONED The people who got their hands on Buzalac and on the money coming from there know nothing about history, Miss Ema. All they want is to ruin it. To make their own. I mean, their business. Look here, on the front page. Professor Dumitraş's statements from Ema's show, The Scandal of the Day, were hotly contested. Dr. Moroianu even accuses the academic Dumitraş of being senile. "So at Buzalac, there's not even a bar, let alone…" - Good morning. - Morning. Wow, you slept for so long. Do you wanna eat? You haven't eaten in two days. - Did you get the newspapers? - Yes, they're here on the… - I made a coffee for you. - I'll take it. You'll take it? Leave that cat alone. It will go bald from all the petting. She doesn't want to eat. Because you're stuffing her, that's why. - You know there's been another earthquake? - Yeah, I know. I know everything. Do you know how long you slept for? EMA DREAMS OF RELICS IN DOBROGEA Many hours? Two days. Are you serious? EMA EMBARRASSED ON TV DR. DUMITRAŞ IS SENILE But it's good you got some rest. Fuck them and all the work. They say you're the "Queen of Lies". Are you planning to leave the show? Ema, what do you have to say? Why are you laughing like an idiot? Open it. It doesn't work. That's the order. I've been told that from today we're not colleagues anymore. - And you'll quit. - Really? And I'll be your mom's colleague? I told you to open it! You're not gonna open it? What? What is happening? I found out I quit. Have you lost your mind? Don't you think I should know what happened two nights ago? - What were those aberrations? - Aberrations? Ricu, are you crazy? That information is real. Everyone has seen it. The whole country! The press was ready and worked all night to tear me to pieces. The press, Ricu! Who owns the press? Isn't it yours? Watch your tone, Ema! I tried. Didn't I let your show run until the end? It was above me. Where did Vâlcu get the idea that the information is false? There were no sources, they were real. I brought evidence, Ricu! Go and talk to him. I told you, it was above me. And how do I deal with the press? Who is gonna clear my name? - You made a fool of myself. - Thank you. I went to Ricu. Did you do this to me? Tell me, who told you to fire me? Did they pay you? Do you want to be called "the big one"? Just so you know, you're not big at all. Ema, you're the show's face. - Who can fire you? - Exactly! You did it yourself. - Look at the ratings. - Give me a break. - This is not about the ratings. - You changed, Ema. I think some time away from the TV screen would do you good. Maybe a change. Look, swap to Stars or Matinal. You're making fun of me, right? Say you're making fun on me. Tell me you're making fun of me! I built the image of this shitty show. I'm a brand. Any other channel would give me double just to sign their registry. You can't fire me. If I leave by myself, maybe. That's something else. - Savu would hire me tomorrow. - That's an idea. And if you have a few hundred euros to throw out the window… - Meaning? - But maybe he'll help you. Mr. Lawyer, you wanted to say something. Excuse me, there is a clause in the contract… Saying you're not allowed to get another job in TV for six months. - Otherwise you'll have to pay... - Excuse me! …200,000 euros. I can't believe you'd use this contract that I signed ten years ago. I've been slaving away for you for ten years. Ten years! Ema, take my advice. Take a holiday. One, two, three months, you decide. Go and travel. Rest. Meanwhile, we'll see what ratings Scandal makes with the new decor. By the way, very beautiful! Dragoş will replace you. We'll see what ratings he'll do. Have you lost your mind? How the fuck can Dragoş host my show? That midget with shitty diction? My show? Your show is mine. I gave it to you. I gave it, I take it back. If you feel you beat me with this thing, you're wrong. You're a worthless man. Don't look for the car, they took it to the service. Order from the director. For your mom! CAN-CAN WITH DRAGOŞ Thank you very much! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's not what it looks like. Ema Cerchez didn't change her sex for the ratings. I advise you to help me welcome with applause the one named Simona Love. SIMONA LOVE FALLS IN LOVE Wow! - Good evening. - Good evening. Welcome, Simona! Have a seat here. Simone, this is for you. Flower for a flower. Thank you! Good evening. And greetings to all my fans. And because our show thinks about the ladies in front of the TV we have another special guest, the famous adult-movie actor, Frank Oţel. FRANK OŢEL: "I WANT A DIVORCE URGENTLY" - Damn! - Good evening, ladies. Good evening, Simona. - Hi, welcome. - It's good to be here. BREAKUP AND MARRIAGE LIVE ON TV You hurried, and went into a storm in a toy boat. Why didn't you have patience? I read the news and I wasn't happy. Thank you, but pity doesn't help me. Tell me you have something for me. Unfortunately, the Services will turn a blind eye to Buzalac. There's a lot of money at stake. It needs to be shared. They're hand-in-hand. But I have something else. There's gonna be another huge earthquake in Finances. There are going to be some very serious arrests in the following days. Insist on this lead. I had plenty of information. Some on its way. Thank you, Radu, my dear. But I want to close with Buzalac. I have information, but not enough proof. Why aren't you patient? Leave Buzalac! Leave it for a bit. I gave you some other information here. Some disclosures about Vâlcu's past. Read them… have some fun… Then remind him of them. And I'm sure he'll understand he needs to bring you back on the show. If he's not an idiot, and he's not… He'll do it. This is truly something. How much do I owe you for this? Take care of yourself. Bring me a coffee, dear. No sugar. In a second. - One! - One! Stop! At ease! Ema? What are you doing? What are you doing here? Are you okay? Who upset you? No one upset you? Ema… Will we talk someday? Are you lying to me? Yes. Yes… That's what you said one year ago, and two years ago, and three years ago… After that we forget again… And mommy reminds you again. On the double! Yeah? - One! - One! - Ema, it's been so long. - Good afternoon. My sweetheart. Where is he? Around. He slept at noon. Wait, let me look at you. Yes, mom, look. You're not okay. I know, I can see you. - Why haven't I seen you on the show? - Silly things. - Where is Ioşi? - Silly things? - Am I bothering you? - Bothering… Of course not. - Can I bring you anything? - I was talking to a business partner. We've just finished a transaction. - I'll build a hospital. - Congratulations. I'm glad. I took down the Tonitza and I put a Ressu instead. Do you like it? I need a car for a day or two. - Sure. - Mine was taken to service. Take whichever you want from the garage. Do you want a driver too? No, I don't need a driver. I want to leave Bucharest for a bit. To be alone. Where are you going in this weather? To Buzalac. Buzalac? What are you going to do in Buzalac? I received some reliable information that there is some initial data certifying the existence of archaeological remains. Well, what are you gonna do with those remains? The Ministry of Culture made a decision, and behind it, there should be documentation written by specialists. I can drive Ispas into a corner. And any other smart boys involved in this. Ispas… - Is your source reliable? - Yes. As reliable as a source can be. It's someone from the Services, can't tell you more than that. - Do I know him? - No, I don't think you do. Girl, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but that decision was retracted after a week. That decision from Culture fell with the change of Government. I'm impressed! How do you know about this? There was nothing in the press. I was in Parliament, no? I was in the committee that was watching funds for Culture and Cults. There was some commentary about it, but nothing much. There wasn't a big commentary. Do you want some? No, thanks. Decision of the Ministry or not, I want to see the town hall in Buzalac with my own eyes. - Will you give me the car? - Of course. Watch out. If you dig around and you find something, you might disturb someone. It might be dangerous. I offered everything to her… I gave her a new life. She's someone because of me, and now… I thought many times, maybe it would have been better if I had taken her back to the orphanage. Maybe she would have found a better father. What do you think? Hello, yes. I have some information about Buzalac that might interest you. Seriously? - And Dragoş? - I called you, didn't I? If you want to see what I'm talking about, I'm in front of your house on Silişteanu, no. 89. - This is where you live, right? - All right. I'll come down. From what I understand, you're Vâlcu's contact. See, you're wrong again. - No, I'm not Vâlcu's contact. - No? - No. - Anyway, it doesn't matter. And him? That's Greg, my boyfriend. Best hacker around. He helped me with the Buzalac report. And? Ema… Buzalac. I'm listening. Tell her everything. Well, the land in Buzalac is divided into several dozen sections. Which were returned to the people by The Land Fund Committee on the same day. What's amazing is that all the people who got their land back made sale and purchase agreements on the same day with the same buyer. - Does this buyer have a name? - Yes. Eufrosina Tache, 78 years old. Obviously. Look here. Two years ago, the Ministry of Culture issued a decision by which the land is declared of national importance. The generous state compensates the old lady with a value equal to its weight in gold. Or, anyway, something close. A few weeks afterwards the Government, and the Minister fall, and the decision is canceled. Eventually, when the things settle, the land is leased for 80 years to Eoinvest. And Eoinvest starts investing. Yeah… Obviously, in their interest. - Nothing new. - You have to find the whole truth here. - Not the crumbs you had on your show. - God! Tell me more! I'm wondering what would make me trust you. Nothing. Maybe… me. Yeah, maybe you. This is how we'll do this. I'll give you a memory stick and you take it to Ricu in person. You tell him not to open it until I call him. That's it. I got the rest. What's this? It has lots of spots. Look! An awful lot. It's a giraffe. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Ema Cerchez and I invite you to watch the first edition of the show The Scandal of the Day. We have here with us, Mr. Mircea Geoană, Minister of External Affairs of Romania, who will discuss the events of today. This unfortunate day, the 11th of September, in New York. Mr. Mircea Geoană, please. Black September. I'd have never ever thought I'd live to see anything like this. It's revolting. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - You're not from around here. - I think I'm lost. - Do you live in the area? - Used to, now we're in the city. We went to our relatives to get a chicken, some eggs… Whatever they could give us. It's hard in Bucharest. That's true… I'm thinking of building a little house around here. It's really beautiful. Do you think I can find some land to buy? - Yeah… - Small chances, everything's been sold. Everything. Everything but Răfăilă's, that old man. - Is the land here that good? - Shut up, man. - It's good. - Yes, it's good. I mean, it's not good ma'am, nothing grows around here. It's like rock. Whatever you plant wouldn't stick in the ground. But it sold well, didn't it? So it's good, ma'am. Let's go, or we'll miss the bus. - Good luck around here. - Let's go! You're all incompetents. The man from Bucharest called me. He's not pleased that there's no progress with the project. Have you seen that they talked about the ruins on TV? He said he'll skin us alive if we don't clean the place. Because the press is meant to come here soon. To film. And if they show it on TV… And anyone sees the ruins, we're done for good. And! Tell me, Toni. Are you sleeping? Well, the workers didn't come. I talked to them to send bulldozers, excavators And? They brought them in front of the town hall and left them there. What's it saying? All good. - All good? - Yes, that's what it says. And if, God forbid, we're not done and they can't build the turbines? And we're standing here like idiots, instead of making space on the field, and our plans turn to dust? - Good afternoon! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Can I please drink some water? Come in, help yourself. Everyone wants water. Aren't you afraid to live by yourself in the middle of nowhere? I haven't been afraid all my life to be alone here, especially now, look how well guarded I am. What are they guarding? Did they find a treasure? Sulfina, my wife. That's the treasure. Bones of the dead, what else? Don't you see how they look? Why did you come here? I came to see if I could buy some land around here. Mr. Răfăilă, would you sell me your land? Miss, I want quiet here. I don't want them here bothering me. And if I make them leave you alone, would you sell it to me? Young lady, you're tricking me. I'm watching you on TV every evening. You're the Queen on TV. Then tell me, are there ruins around here or not? There are, but I don't know how many. But I saw when they were digging, they got out jugs full of coins. With little coins. Yes! Come in. Come in if you want. There used to be a lake down there. That's why the name of this place is Buzalac. Then, the people moved there beyond the hill. They moved because of the wind. God doesn't give a day without strong wind here. So that space at the lake became the graveyard of the poor. Good afternoon. To the town hall? - To the secretary? - Yes. Park it, and come through here. It's closer. Where are we gonna get 200,000 per piece? Let me see where you put your money, because Switzerland doesn't want tourists anymore. They're dirty with money too. We'll open a small bank. For children. In our playground. I'll explain it for the last time. The man called me from Bucharest last night. And he said we have to clean the place immediately. To take the bones out of there, for fuck's sake, to demolish the graves, to mix everything, and that's it! And then we'll never work again. Neither we, nor our children. Nor our children's children. Nor our children's children's children. You'll see. Like in Stephen the Great. - Did you read that? - No. - I haven't read it. - Me neither. I've read it. Or… I haven't read it. He hasn't. Enough. We'll go tonight and start… Then go and get the word out in the village, for fuck's sake. Gather people and put your back into it. And promise stuff. Like in elections. - Sugar, flour, oil! - Plastic bags… - Buckets! - No! No sugar, no oil, promise something else! Lifetime pension. Viagra by the bag. Something else! Prigoană, the three of you go from door to door. Don't talk to yourself, wait for the people to come out, then talk. - We'll talk until people come out. - No. First the they come out, then we talk. But how are they coming out if we don't talk? We call for them! So we do talk! Yes! We talk a little bit. Good afternoon. - I'm looking for the secretary. - Well done, you found him. What do you want? I'd like to buy some land in the area, and I need some information. What land? What information? - Does your computer system work? - Yes, of course it works. Why wouldn't it? What would you like to know? I want to make sure it's not occupied by any task or sale and purchase agreement. Wise! Very good. Do you have a cadastral number? I don't know it, but I know the name. There can't be more than one Răfăilă in Buzalac, right? That's true, there's just one Răfăilă in the village and he's not selling. May the maggots eat him. Excuse me. 'Cause he's not dead yet. He's actually selling to me. We agreed on a price. - Really? - Yes. Could you please check? I'll check. Just a moment. How did she get in here? She came through the back, by the toilets. She said she's coming to see you. - Do you think she's stolen anything? - To see me? Where is the mayor? In the festivities hall. This way please. Come in. - Good afternoon. - Take a seat there in the back. There's a lady here who says she agreed with Răfăilă to buy his land. Are you serious? So we didn't succeed with all the money from the state, and you did? Yes, I really want to buy it. Have a better look at her. Do you know what caught my eye? Her boobs! God, can you imagine what's in there? What are you doing here? Get out! Do you recognize her now? Look in here. - Bitch! - The wig. The bitch from TV. See how she's wearing it? What are you doing in our village? I told you, I want to buy. What beautiful eyes you've got. And what do we have here, ma'am? What do we have here? Mr. Mayor! You know what this is, right? A hidden camera. So we would have appeared on Candid Camera, yeah? But we're not the idiots we once were! What a dramatic entrance! Drop it! Wait. - My car! - It's gone. Come, let's take mine. Let's go. - Do you have the laptop with you? - Of course. Download this. - I didn't go there like an idiot. - What's this? You'll figure out yourself. Call Ricu on your phone. - God, you're good as new. - Watch it. What's that? Do you think I did nothing? I snatched it from the city hall. - Ricu! - Yes, Ema. I'll bring you some content on Buzalac, you'll kiss my feet for it. I also have a title. "Tonight, prosecution will be working." - Can you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. I'm listening. For this, I need a favor. I need to be on the show tonight. Wait. I called the big boss. Wait. Wait, you're rushing. Listen, in the envelope from Velvet there is a memory stick. - Please give that to Vâlcu. - I will if I find him. No, Ricu. Listen to me. You'll find him. Insist that he sees what's on there. I promise there are enough arguments there to make him shut up. Come on, Ricu. Please trust me. Ricu, we've been through so much together. - All right. - Perfect. I need you to bring Ispas on the show. - That's necessary. - What do I do with Dragoş? Let Dragoş believe he's going to host the show. -Thanks a lot. You won't regret it -Did you think about me? Of course. You're the first one I thought about. Done, everything is copied. - Should I send it to the newsroom? - Yes. - To whom? - Send it to… Let me think. Grig, my friend. You met him. The guy with the circles. He made quite a lot of montages on the internet, so he could… Perfect. Tell him to make a five-seven minute montage without music. Then add a copy of the file. And send the file to Ricu's email. Do you have it? Yes, I do. Thank you. I didn't say "thank you" even when they hired me, you know. And I like men. Only men. No worries, there's no danger here. I wanted to know how you got to Buzalac. Yeah, I would have been curious too. My grandpa used to live around, somewhere close to Buzalac. I've been with him to the town hall many times. Money, land… Fields, postponements… Autumn wine… Weddings, Christenings… Graveyard… All with my grandpa. So I know the town hall like my grandpa's house. Give me your badge. Everyone, phones off… - Has Ispas got here? - Still in traffic. He'll be here in five. - Good evening. - Peace. - Ema! - How is it going? I hope I'm not making a mistake. - Good luck! - Thanks. - What are you doing here? - Whoever the announcer calls goes on. Announce Ema Cerchez, like we agreed. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to welcome the Queen of Live TV, Ema Cerchez. - Good evening. - Go, Ema! I'm glad to be here again. I hope you missed me, even though I haven't been gone for too long. So, look, I rushed back here. I rushed… that's what they say. I'm limping, I think I have a dislocated shoulder and my face is not exactly how it used to be. Who helped me with this transformation… we'll see. Our guest this evening is Mr. Deputy Haralambie Ispas. Unfortunately, or not, the deputy is a bit late. So we'll cut to the chase. You will see a movie on the screen which we'll talk about together. The title of the show tonight is: "Tonight, prosecution will be working." At the end, you get to decide for yourselves whether to applaud or boo. The movie, please. - We've started already. - Move! - We have a very big problem. - Okay, afterwards, over a beer. There's no problem. - Good evening, Mr. Deputy. - Good evening. Thank you for coming. Mr. Deputy, the largest landowner in Buzalac. Where did you come up with this, "the largest landowner in Buzalac"? More modesty, Ma'am Ema. "Ma'am" … Thank you for this. I'm curious how you'll make us believe that your distinguished mother-in-law, at the venerable age of 84, paralyzed, touched by Alzheimer's, bought all the land under the wind farm. We're talking hundreds of hectares. That's a gratuitous statement, Miss Ema. You're lying to the public again with all these aberrations. Aberrations? We have something special for you. What, other lies? You did this with the president of this country. And you embarrassed yourself in public. In front of the country. Yeah? Here is a sale-purchase deed taken from the Buzalac town hall. …the owner of the land in Buzalac leased it to the Eoinvest concern for 80 years. You can easily read the signature. Eufrosina Tache, your mother-in-law residing at your address We will request a specialized expertise, madam. We're going to sue you, madam. We're going to sue the whole channel, madam. If you're going to sue us anyway, Mr. Deputy, I'll show you a movie that the public has already seen. Ema Cerchez was beaten and sequestered by the men of Buzalac's mayor after she discovered that he helped Deputy Haralambie Ispas to ruin archeological remains, in order to build a wind farm. - Sir, please stop. You're killing her. - If the boss finds out, he'll kill us. And you whore come here to ruin our deal. If the boss finds out… - He'll kill all of us. - Sir, stop, you're killing her. You, morons that aren't drinking. Take the keys. Take her to the cellar. And give her lots of wine, so there'll be enough for everyone. You know what caught my eye? - The wig! - The bitch from TV! There is a lot to say about the wind turbines in Buzalac. Let's see what the prosecution says about this. Political framing! No! We didn't do anything! We'll prove it! We didn't do anything! PROSECUTORS DESCEND IN FORCE A SHORT TIME AGO GROUP OF CRIMINALS AT BUZALAC TOWN HALL THE ARREST OF THE MAYOR TASE IORGA I'm innocent… SERIOUS CHARGES! ISPAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED The mayor of Buzalac and his men were detained for 24 hours by DIICOT prosecutors. The charges are sequestration and attempted murder. Investigators are also now checking the land transactions. I'm… innocent… I am innocent… If I said you were extraordinary, would it go to your head? Yes. That's okay, you were extraordinary! I think we had a huge audience! I was a bit afraid that Ispas would have a heart attack. People like this would never have heart attacks. - Retaliation? Are we afraid? - No one called. The proof is obvious, fuck them. What the fuck is happening here? No one is listening to me anymore? No one? Easy with the swearing. We're working on television, okay? I'm listening, boss, but your secretary thought you were missing, you didn't pick up your phone… By the way, where were you? - I banged someone. - Congrats, be happy! It's serious. Ugly… This is how people who disturb the dead act. If only they read what was written on the crosses before bothering them… Poor dead, they'd already paid once for their sins, no? To come now and make them pay again, in a new life, it's a bit excessive… Dear Ema. I hope you understand what I'm saying. I'm trying. - Did you like the ending? - Of course. I was waiting for it. I've known you since you were young. I know your dad. Now I know everyone. Dad, I want to celebrate. My love. Could you recognize Ispas? Ask someone to bring us some champagne. When I saw you tonight… I said to myself, we need to make a TV show. Hi, Ema. Velvet? Tell me you're a lookalike. Ema, you know Velvet. Her dad recommended her, my good friend in Internal Affairs. - Gică Popa. - Dad. Wait. Let me understand. What has her dad to do with anything? Her dad is a very good friend. He sent Velvet to help me get my hands on these things. And watch you for a bit. I told her my family is from Buzalac, that my grandpa had land there - …but I don't know the details. - You explained it very well, sweetie. Ema… I tried to tell you about my rivalry with Ispas. That man started to bother me. For Buzalac. I had no choice. There was just me and him left. But you know Ispas. That memory stick doesn't lie, does it? That memory stick I gave you? Did you make it public? Did you give it to the press? Are you gonna release a book as well? I'm done with you. Are you telling me you're involved in this wind farm business? That you're involved in Buzalac? For God's sake, are you involved in everything? Not really with the wind turbines. But with the land there. And more recently, Scythian tombs. - Then we got some problems. - And you lied to me. No, Ema… Money makes us lie sometimes… Actually, you used me again. And I was stupid. I'm not a dog, Ioşi. I'm not your dog. Stay away from me. You're a monster! I can't believe how much harm you've done to me in this life! I'd ask for your forgiveness… But it wouldn't help with anything. No? I'll take this file. You can take whatever you want. I did nothing but try to protect you. Ema… You're my love. You're my love, Ema. We all make choices in our life, don't we? You can show this file and bury the man who offered you everything forever. Or destroy it… Delete everything… And don't forget. Yes, I can. I can. That would have been my choice too. Ema… My love? Ema! What am I gonna do with you? I don't have time for this. Make time! What? Can I come with you? Come with me? Where? So I'll come with you… Make time! THE END
