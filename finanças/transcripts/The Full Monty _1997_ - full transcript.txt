[Fanfare] Welcome to Sheffield... the beating heart of Britain's industrial north. The jewel in Yorkshire's crown is home to over half a million people... and thousands more flock here daily to shop and to work. All this is built on Sheffield's primary industry- steel. The city's rolling mills, forges and workshops... employ some 90,000 men and state-of-the-art machinery... to make the world's finest steel... from high-tensile girders to the stainless cutlery... that ends up on your dining table. But it's not all hard work for the people of Steel City. They can spend the day lounging by the pool... watching one of our top soccer teams... or browsing in the shops. But when the sun goes down the fun really starts... in the city's numerous nightclubs and discotheques. Yes, Yorkshire folk know how to have a good time. And it's good times for the city's housing too. Sheffield leads the way in town planning. Victorian slums have been cleared to make way for the homes of the future. Thanks to steel... Sheffield really is a city on the move. - [Steel Bar Dragging On Ground] - [Door Opens] Gaz, who's gonna buy a rusty girder? - Come on. - Dad, it's stealing. No, it's liberating, love. Liberating. Gaz, hang on! Ten years we worked in here. Now look. - What if we get caught? - You don't get criminal record till you're 16. Just don't tell your mum. - Hey, listen. Music. Yeah. Bloody hell! - What are they doin'? - [Boy] It's the factory band. They're still going, you know. About the only thing round here that is. - Eh up! Security guard's back. [Door Rolling Shut] Won't take a minute, he says. Won't take a minute. - Now what? - Shut up. I'm thinkin'. - Can't we do normal things sometimes? - This is normal. In't it, Dave? Oh, aye. Everyday stuff, this. I think this bugger's sinkin'. Right. Now pick it up and slide it across other side. That's it. Aw, fuckin' hell, Nathe! They're 20 quid each, them. That were your bloody maintenance, were that! - Oh, shit. - Ah, nice one. Nathe. Nathan- Fuckin' hell! - Come here! Come here! - Jesus. Stay still. Stay still, stay still. All right. What's your initiative got to say about this, then, bog-eyes? - Eh up. Someone coming. - All right? - Aye. Not so bad. Not so bad?

Just shut it. - Aww! - Eh up, Dave. All right, babe? - Dad. What you reckon, Dave? Eight? Maybe even a nine. - You can never tell till you see their tits. - Dad! - What's all this, then? - It's them Chippendale efforts. - You what? - Them dancers. - Mum were going on about it. - You're joking. - She must be getting desperate. - Away, Gaz. - You all waiting for me, then? - Yeah, to go home! You know where to find me when you're tired of looking at them poofs. - Come on, Gaz. I'm freezing. Women only? Cheeky buggers. It's a bloody workingmen's club. Look at the state of that. I don't know what you got to smile about. He's got no willy for starters, has he? There's nowt in a gym that'll help you there, mate. - No decent woman would be seen dead in there. - Jean would. - Dave, what's going on? - It's her money, isn't it? Fuckin' hell! Are you gonna just stand there... while some poof s waving his tackle at your missus? Where's your pride, man? She's already got you hoovering. I saw it, and I let it go. But this- No, no, no. You wanna get her out of there and tell her what for. He can't. It's women only. - [Disco] - [People Cheering] - Hurry up, will you? Me feet have gone numb. - That's gratitude for ya. We're riding into "Alley of Death" for you, you fat git. It's not my fault I can't fit through, is it? - Right then. I'll be waiting here, keeping guard. - [Crowd Cheering] You find AuntieJean and tell her Uncle Dave wants a word outside. - Do I have to? - Good kid. On you go. [Cheering Continues] [Rock] Go to it. [Continues] Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! [Cheering Continues] [Emcee] Come on, ladies.! Shut up, sit down, cross your legs.! Ooh, I'm not waitin' in that bloody queue! - I always wanted a nosy in the men's toilet! - Ohh! Them bloody muscles! It's not their bodies, Bee. It's what they do with 'em that counts. I don't know what you're worryin' about with you-know-who on your tail. [Singing] Hey, hey, hey! Frank don't fancy me, and I don't fancy Frank. So bloody well give over! - Hey, do you think he might, though? - [All Laughing] No. Couldn't do that to Dave. Not even if I wanted to. But, you know, it's like he's given up- work, me, everything. - Ah, love. - Here, love. This'll cheer you up. - [Urinating] - [All Laughing] I weren't in Girl Scouts for nothing! [Laughing Continues] Gaz. Gaz! - That were ourJean, weren't it? - No, no. Just a couple of old tarts. Going back in for Nathe. [Disco] - [Continues] - [Cheering Continues] - You're in big trouble. - What about AuntieJean? - [Continues] - AuntieJean's busy. [Nathan] I don't feel well. [Gaz] Of course you don't. You got an hangover. Take a day off, hang about at home. Your house is messy. It's cold and all. - Then come down Jobclub. That'd be a right laugh. - Mum's house is always warm. I can't always have the red carpet out for ya, can I? Anyway, it's not your mum's house. It's-What's his name- Barry's. Tell you what. Next weekend I'll have a big tidy around. I promise. - Even go and see a footie game. - Yeah? Sunday league in the park. There's gonna be some right good players. United play Man U, aren't they? Oh, Nathe, you know I can't stretch to that. You're always making me do stupid stuff like last night. Other dads don't do that. Don't they? Aye. Bye. Hey, Nathe! We could try and sneak into Man U. - Terry were telling us about this gap in fence- - No! All right. I'll get tickets. I will. Ooh, ahh, Cantona, has to wear a girlie bra! We'll stuff'em, Nathe. Fuck. I want the application letters fiinished by the time I get back. Right? Any problems, I'm outside. I tell you, when women start pissing like us, that's it. We're fiinished, Dave. 'Extincto. ' Yeah, but, I mean, how- You know, how- Genetic mutations, in't it? They're turning into us. A few years and men won't exist, except in a zoo or summat. I mean, we're not needed no more, are we? Obsolete. Dinosaurs. Yesterday's news. Like skateboards. Button it, you lot. Some of us are trying to get a job. - It says "No smoking" in here. - Aye, and it says "Jobclub" up there. - Remember the last time you saw one of them walk in? - [All Laughing] You forget, Gerald, you're not our foreman anymore. You're just like the rest of us- scrap. Shut it. Right? Hang on. Why were them women in workingmen's club in first place, eh? Now, then. 'Cause of us- men. You call them Chippendales men? Degrading, that's what it were. - How many lasses were there though? - Thousands, bayin' for blood. Ten quid and all to watch some fuckin' poof get his kit off. Ten quid. Right, times 10 quid by a thousand... and you've got- Yeah, well, a lot. A very lot. - Yeah. - 10,000 quid. - How much? - 10,000 quid. Hey, now, Dave, I mean, it's worth a thought, though, innit? Oh, aye. I can just see Little and Large prancing round Sheffield with their widgers hanging out. - Now, that would be worth 10 quid. - Don't be so bloody daft. - We were just saying- - Widgers on parade. Bring your own microscope. I don't see why the chuff not, Gerald. Because you're fat and he's thin and you're both fuckin' ugly. - Bastard! - [All Yelling] What's all this about sole custody? You know what it is, Gary. If you want joint custody, then you have to pay your share. - 700 quid. - I'm on dole, in case you hadn't noticed! Then get a job. I'll give you a job. At ï¿¡2.50 an hour in black hole of fuckin' Calcutta? - No, thank you. - Fine. Whatever. If you want to go play games do that, but from now on Nathan's gonna have two parents. And your live-in lover is gonna do that, is he? Oh, abracadabra! - Here he is. Evenin', Barry. - That'll be for a court to decide. No, it won't. Nathan's yours and he's mine, and he's fuck-all to do with him! - As if you've ever given a toss. - Face it, Gary. - He don't even like stayin' at yours. - Of course he bloody does! Ask him. Ask him! Oi, Nathe.! We have a laugh. Don't we, kid? - Gary, don't! - Is he in? Is he in? Nathe.! He can't hear you through your triple bloody glazing. He can hear, all right. This is all wrong, this is. It's all to fucking cock. I'm his dad, and you- you're nobody. Good night, Gary. Good night, Nathe. See ya, kid. No. Not doin' it. I'm not strippin'. Dave, they're taking him away. All I need is 700 quid and they've got nowt on me. - Gaz, no. - Dave, he's me kid. - Suppose there's nicking cars. - No! Well, then? Look, I'll help, all right? I'm running, aren't I? But I'm taking nowt off. Final. Come on, Dave. Don't stop now. Keep up, you fat bastard. - Gazza, you tosser. - [Car Engine Cranking] [Panting] [Engine Continues Cranking] [Dave] You need a hand? Yeah, it's your H.T. Leads, I reckon. - Give it a go at that. - [Engine Starts, Revs] [Chuckles] Didn't you used to work up at Harrison's before it shut down? Yeah. Thought I clocked ya. I were on floor with Gaz- him up road. How's it going, then? You got any work? No, there's not a lot about, is there? Yeah, well, like I say, get some new ones when you get the chance. No, no. My chuffin' pleasure. Dave? [Coughs] - [Panting] - [Coughing] - You all right, kid? - You bastard. [Groaning, Coughing] - Hey! Hey! - [Pounding On Window] You could shoot yourself. [Gaz] Where's he gonna fiind a gun from round here? - You wanna find yourself a big bridge, you do. - Yeah. Like one of them bungee jumps, only without the bungee bit. I can't stand heights, me. Drownin'. Now, there's a way to go. I can't swim. You don't have to fuckin' swim, you divvy. That's the whole point. God. You're not very keen, are ya? Sorry. I know. You could stand in middle of road and get a mate to drive smack into you, fast. I haven't got any mates. We just saved your fuckin' life, so don't tell us we're not your mates. All right? - Yeah? - [Dave] Yeah, me and all. I'd run you down soon as look at ya. Oh. Cheers. Ta. Thanks a lot. [Door Lock Opening] [Panting] [Door Opens, Closes] - What are you doin', Mum? - Where have you been? Driving. Driving where? Just driving. I thought you'd gone. Security guard in here? No wonder he wants to kill himself. Well, at least one bloke got a job out of this place being shut down. What'd you tell him for, any road? Kid's a nutter. He's a bugle player. Could come in right handy. Might need a bit of music. He's got a car, somewhere to practice. Besides, good what's-his-name for the lad- therapy. Oh, aye. Jigglin' about in the buff, therapy. He won't be the only one tryin' to kill himself if you carry on with this caper. - Dad, I'm hungry. - [Horn Honks] Eh up. Hey! Lomper! - Where's me rice? - Try the cylinder head, tubby. I don't like Chinese. Of course you do. Don't ya? - Let's see his records. - What we got then, Dave? "The Floral Dance." - "Marching With Hepworth." - Jesus Christ. Ah, Hot Chocolate.

Oh, Nathe.! Nathan.! Nathan.! Hellfire! What are you doin' out here, kid? Nowt. Walkin' home. It's miles home. You know that. Why did you run off like that? You're embarrassed, aren't ya? You think your own dad's a dickhead. [Sighs] We're not doing this for a laugh, you know. I'm trying to get some brass together... so as you and me can keep seeing each other. They're trying to stop us, you see. Oh, well, I may as well not bother, except I'm your dad. That counts for summat, don't it? I like you. I love you, you bugger. All right, kid? - All right? - Yeah.

[Nathan Laughs] [Lomper] Hey, you said you wanted a dance teacher. [Dave] Gerald? Go get chuffed. He'd tell every bugger. We'd be laughed out of Sheffield. - [Woman] Well done, everybody. - Bandits at 6:00. Ah, come in, Torvill. Park your sequins over here. You've had your little laugh. Now you can piss off. - It's a free country. - I thought you were rather good. Very nifty footwork. Gerald- Oh. Hello. - We're missing the rumba. - I was just having a chat with some pals from work. Oh. Not thinking ofjoining our class? - Funny you should mention. - I think we'd better be getting back now, eh? - Well, good night. - [Gaz] You get back to your rumba. We'll see you later, Gerald. At work. He's got gnomes. Aye. He bloody would have. [Humming] - Things looking up? - You know, love, I think they just might be. Good. You've been working too hard. About time you let one of your colleagues do the lion's share for a change. I wish you'd be firmer, Gerald. - Oh, well, mustn't be late. - So it's all right if I, uh- - Oh, Linda, love, you know l- - Oh, don't be so mean. Things are looking up. You said so yourself. You'll love skiing. Linda- Don't matter. Good-bye. Hey, Gaz. - Off to the office, Torvill? - Yes, I bloody am. Put that back. Put it back! See that? Interview. In the bloody bag. Mate. I know him from Harrison's. I can do the job standin' on me head... and I won't have to look at your ugly mugs ever again. - We just need a bit of help. - There's nothing I can do to help the likes of you. Just wanna know about dancing, that's all. Dancers have coordination, skill, timing, fitness and grace. Take a long, hard look in the mirror. Now, I'm busy. Don't be late forJobclub, lads. Bastard! Starting at 1 6,000, plus the pension scheme. It'll be a relief to get back to work. It's not been an easy six months, granted.

She's out there now, let loose on high street with a fuckin' MasterCard... spending! Why can't you just tell her? How can I tell her after six months? A woman who wants to go skiing for us holidays. [Sobbing] Skiing, for fuck's sake.! Why did you do it? It was my job! It had to be my... job. [Door Opens] [Door Closes] Can't you just leave me alone? Stuck it with superglue. You can't hardly see it join. Look. - Go on. - Oh, yeah. Got this in jumble, like, to say sorry. Wheels go round and everything. [Spins Wheel] It's for your gnomes, really, not you, but- I, uh- [Inhales] I don't know, uh- [Exhales] It's marvelous, this.

[Chattering] [Gaz] Think any of them can dance? You're not still on about this Chippendale's malarkey, are ya? The Yorkshire version. Them buggers can, we bloody can. - You can't dance. - We know, Gerald. - Niner on its way. - Why do you think we're trailing you all over town? It's not my kind of dancing. It's all arse wigglin' and that. I've got a degree in arse wigglin', mate. You learn us dancin', I'll learn you rest. For once, I'm dead serious. I need your help. What if someone spots me? What if Linda finds out? I've got standin', me. Aye. You've an overdraft and all, mate. [Pop] [Continues] [Continues] [Stops] [Stops] I'm sorry. Sorry. Thought I'd give it a go. I got a bit desperate. You know how it is. I can't even take me kit off properly, can I? You're all right, Reg. There's a cup of tea, if you like. - No, thanks. I've got the kids outside. - Well, bring 'em in. Nah. This is no place for kids. [Door Closes] This is crazy. So... it's, uh, Mr. Horse. Horse. Yeah, well, uh, just a minute, Mr. Horse. - My colleagues on the panel. - Ask him why he's called the Horse. You bloody ask him. It's not 'cause he does Grand National, is it? That's all very well, but what's the point of having a big wanger... if you need a Zimmer frame to tout it in? - I mean, he must be 50 ifhe's a day. - So, Horse, what can you do? Don't know, really. Um, let's see. There's the, uh- There's the Bump, the Stomp, the Bus Stop. Me break dancin'days are probably over. - But there's always the Funky Chicken. - Now you're talkin'. - All of them? - Well, yeah, I think so. Well, it's been a while, mind. And I've got this dodgy hip. Yeah. Well, stick it on, Nathe. And do your worst, pal. [Rock] [Continues] [Ends] Me favorite film's Singin'in Rain. Me favorite film's Singin'in Rain.

But... if you were on lookout for a new fella, right- If you were- Just sayin'- would you think about it? What's got into ya? No, but would you, though? I might do, yeah. - Is that all right? - So it's true, then. I've bloody had enough of this. What's true? What they say about black blokes. They've got great bodies and that. Some of them, yeah. And? Nothin'. David, I don't care if they're black, white or bloody rainbow-colored. I'm married to you. Remember? Yeah. Good night. Why would I want anyone else, eh... big man? Jeanie. I'm all in.

You're on a diet. - Don't you start now. Right. How much you got, then? Twenty-two-Twenty-seven pence. 4.99, special offer. We're still a fucking fiver short. Well, you know what this means, Dave. Oh, no. Come on, Gaz. Why me? You've got an innocent face. I've got "serial killer" written on me forehead. If you're not gonna dance, you can do summat bloody well useful instead.

[Alarm Blaring] [Alarm Stops] [Alarm Blaring] [Woman Singing Disco] Hey, what's this? I didn't go on the nick in Asda for some women's how-to video. - It's Flashdance, Dave. She's a welder, isn't she? - A welder? I hope she dances better than she welds. Her mix is all to cock. Shut up, Dave. What the fuck do you know about welding, any road? More than some chuffin' woman. It's like bonfire night. That's too much acetylene, that. Them joints won't hold fuck all. For Christ's sake, Dave, we're looking for dancing. - He's got the hump about Asda. - [Laughing] - [Click] - Hey. Cop a load of that. [Disco] - [Continues] - What did I tell ya?

It's Linda's. And no, you bloody can't, and don't think of askin'. - What am I gonna do about this? - [Gaz] It's not too bad. From the front, like. Fat, David, is a feminist issue. - What's that supposed to mean when it's at home? - I don't bloody know, but it is. I tried dietin'. I do try. Seems I spent most of me fuckin' life on a diet. The less I eat, the fatter I get. So stuff yourself and get thin. - Oh, shut up, saggy tits. - I'm not. This mate of Linda's had this plastic stuff put on her at this posh health club. She lost pounds.! It were like magic.! Oh, what's it called, now? Anyway, it's like cling film. - I've heard of that. - Cling film? I'm not a chicken drumstick, Gerald. No, you wrap it round. Reduce the fat. - [All Chattering] - [Doorbell Rings] - You can't just take stuff! - Sorry, mate. - I only owe him 120 quid. - That's all these'll fetch secondhand. - They're not secondhand. - They are now, mate. - Put down and piss off. - Fuckin'hell.!

I bet even Madonna has difficulty getting her shoes and socks off. - [Guy] You could've had me eye out. - [Gerald] I'm sorry. What are you doing with them, you great bugger? They're bloody borrowed. Gonna use them for the show. It's what them Chippendales do. They put Velcro down the side and then- [Makes Tearing Sound] All is revealed. I'll sew 'em back up after. - Oh, aye. And where did you learn to be an ace sewer then? - Prison. Cheers, Nathe. Come on, Al. It's me. Which is precisely why it's a hundred quid up front. Half price.
