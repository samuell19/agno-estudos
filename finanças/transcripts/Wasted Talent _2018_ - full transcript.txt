- When I was first approached to do the documentary, I was a little apprehensive, obviously being a former police officer and they said why don't just take a meeting and see if you guys, you know, get on the same page. And I spoke to him. I told him if we were to move forward with this, it could not under any circumstances be a puff piece and you know, there might be people calling you a scumbag, piece of shit as well as people saying you deserve a second change and he was okay with that. So, once I found out he was okay with it and it wasn't going to be a puff piece, I decided, you know, I think it would be a good idea doing my due diligence on what actually happened. Once we decided to move forward, I really dug in and did my due diligence on the case and realized that a lot of stuff that I perceived was through tabloids and the newspaper and a lot of other people had the same perception. So basically, it's my job and hopefully when you leave here, you have an opinion of other either way. That he either deserves a second chance or he got out because he is who he is. - How you doin'. My name's Lillo. I'm an addict. - Hi, Lillo. - You know, I went from the kid in the Bronx Tale. You know, rising star from the neighborhood. Starring in the classic movie to a junkie. - [Narrator] Five a.m. December 10th, 2005. Off duty New York police officer, Daniel Enchautegui responded to what sounded like a break in at a neighbor's home. The burglary erupted into a gun fight with Broncato and his accomplice. - They said the police officer is dead. He was villainized in the press immediately. - [Narrator] We all remember Lillo Brancato. He was such a rising star. Acted with De Niro, James Gandolfini. But his career came to a screeching halt one night when he was involved in a crime that ended with a police officer dead. [echoing crash] - So Lillo, tell me about how it was growing up in Yonkers. How about your childhood? Family and all that stuff. - We were very middle class. Blue collar family. It was a very tight knit community. It was all, it was all Italian. It was all Italians with the exception of my next door neighbor which was Puerto Rican. But pretty much, it was all Italian. There was a lot goin' on in the streets. You know, we were playin' stick ball, football. Lot of that goin' on. Parents yellin' from the window to get inside. You know, yeah, it was a really, really good childhood. Lot of great memories from my childhood. - Was there ever type of drug use back then? Not with you. Did you ever witness any of that stuff or was that even a thought or-- - Absolutely not, absolutely. I mean, you would hear about things, you know, in cautionary things, cautionary stuff in school. - Right. - You know about drugs, but that's something that wasn't really prevalent in my life or something that I ever witnessed. Or I really never paid attention to it, only until later on in my life when it, you know, the opportunity to do drugs started presenting itself. - You're on Jones Beach one day with your brother-- - Yeah, brother, like I was like maybe 10, 15 of us. - [Steve] Uh huh, then what happened? - It was the day after Fourth of July. July fifth, 1992, and you know, we just decided let's go to the beach tomorrow. We used to go out to Jones Beach, field four and that's a drive. Yonkers with traffic, it could take you an hour to get out there, sometimes even more. So we went out there. We just went out, school just ended, so this is the beginning of summer vacation and little did I know that that day on the beach was gonna totally change my life. Now, I had heard about The Bronx Tale and I heard that there was open call auditions and that they were looking for someone with no previous acting experience to play Robert De Niro's son and a film called A Bronx Tale which Robert De Niro would make his directorial debut. And you know, to go back to what I was just sayin', I thought in my mind, that would be pretty interesting, being that people tell me that I look like him, but I said, naw, there's now way I'll ever be in a movie. I mean, it's a movie on the big screen. Where the long shot, middle class, blue collar family, it just doesn't happen every day. And my brother, I hear my brother screaming. I didn't know what happened. I ran out of the water and my brother said, "hey, you know, remember that movie we heard "about, that Robert De Niro movie? "Well, this guy, he's out here right, he's out here "on the beach today looking for kids "to play the part and I told him "that you look like him." And the guy's name is Marco Greco and my brother, and the guy said, he told my brother, "you're right, he "does look like him." And I just kind rose to the occasion. I knew, I knew this was my shot. So, he didn't have to ask me to do anything. I just started doin' the face and the whole thing and are you talkin' to me and the guy's like oh wow, this guys' great. I love this guy. So, it was a Sunday, July fifth. He said usually we're closed at the Belmont Playhouse. "Usually we're closed today, but I like you." he goes, can you meet me in the Bronx tonight at this time and for some reason, I just knew. I knew on the ride home from the beach, I just knew that something was gonna happen from this situation. I went home, I told my mom. It was my next door neighbor's birthday. My aunts were there and then, ah, you know. Her son read for the part and she was like, oh, you know, so and so read for the part. You're not gonna get it. They've got so many kids reading and you know, it's big. So I said, well, I can only try, right. So, I went in that night. My two friends drove me down there and the guy, Marco, was there, and I'd never seen anything in the screen play, in screen play form. The guy just gave me the scene and he said, "have you ever done this before," and I said, "no, I've never done this before." he said, "well, here's the scene. "Just read it, see what it is "and I'll come back in a little bit. "Let me know when you're ready "and you'll read it." And I remember just lookin' at it and just looked like something that was familiar to me and something that I possibly would be capable of doing. It was the bathroom scene when I'm shaving. In the original script, De Niro's shaving and I ask him, dad, let me ask you a question about the interracial dating, you know. What his thoughts were on that and the whole thing and that was the audition scene. And I read it and I just knew what to do. It just seemed like it came naturally to me and I told the guy, Marco, I'm ready and I read it and the guy was blown away. He was like, wow, that was great. That was the best anyone's ever read it. And then he started asking me to do other scenes. He said, "why don't you try this scene," and, "do this scene." And the character in the movie, his name was Calogero. My father's Sicilian and so is the character. My father is from the province of Agrigento in Sicily in a little town called Naro and in Italy, you have a lot of these little towns that have saints that come from that town. - Right. - The saint from my father's town was San Calogero and my father even went to the reform school, San Calo, when they used to shorten it. But you know, just for like that part, that role in that movie was just meant for me. - [Steve] It was all lined up. - Yeah, all the stars aligned and I was like, wow, man. He was like, that was great. Then we exchanged numbers and he said right before I left, he said, "call me in "about a week," you know. "Call me in about a week or so and I'll tell you "how you did." And he said a week, that seemed kinda distant. Maybe I thought maybe he didn't like me as much as I thought he liked me. I was working for a lawyer at the time. It was my summer vacation, summer job. I was filing. My father's a builder. The lawyer was did the closings for my father, so he was a family friend and took on a summer job at his office and I used to file stuff, answer phones and I came home from work that day and some woman had called on the phone. She seemed very professional and when I heard her voice, she asked for Lillo and that's also my father's name and she said, "can I please speak "to Lillo Brancato," and I said, "yeah, hold on, I'll "get my dad for you." And she said, "are you Lillo," and I said yeah. She goes, "no, no, I think I want to speak with you." She said, I'm so and so. I work in down in Tribeca Casting and we saw your tape and we loved it. We wanna meet and we would like for you to come down and I was like, wow, you know. Now, it's started becoming real. The next day I went down there with my father and my uncle and was very overwhelmed 'cuz you know, like when I go down there, I've never done, remember, like I said, I've never done this before. I've never been to an audition. I don't know the whole process. I'm not familiar with any of this. So, when I went down there, my father and uncle walked in the room with me and there was like 40 kids there reading for the part and you got kids in the corner reading their lines, talking to the wall like real actors. Guys that really wanna do this. I was so intimidated and so overwhelmed by the whole thing, but I just figured what, they liked what I did, so I'm not gonna change what I did. I'm gonna just keep going in that direction. Obviously they liked me. I made it to this point. So, I went in and I read. They liked me again. They said, "listen, can you come back tomorrow." And I kept getting a call back, call back and as that happened, I noticed that there was a lot less kids in the room and at that point, everyone was introduced to me, you know, on a first name basis and then one day they said we're gonna go upstairs and meet Bob and I had already met Chazz Palminteri. Seen him in the building and he would always congratulate me. Saying thank you for coming down. We really love what you're doin'. Just keep it up. Very inspiring, very inspiring stuff. And then they said we're gonna go upstairs and meet Bob. I said okay. I just thought Bob is maybe a script supervisor or someone, I didn't know who it was. So, the way it was set up, I come in through the door back there. I'm De Niro. He's got his back to me and Chazz is right there. So, I can see Chazz. I can see his profile and then he looked over and they said, they said, the door's a little open. It's open and, "Bob, Lillo's here to meet you." And Bob's you know, turnin' around and then he walked over, like you know. I mean, you can't explain that moment in words and just like when he came up to me and you know, I remember he'd just finished doing a movie, Mad Dog and Glory, so he had that reddish hair that he had, so it wasn't like De Niro, the De Niro that I knew - Right. - from seeing on TV but it was still De Niro. That's still the face. - Right. - We hope they're not fooled by his fame. He's an actor, he's acting on that stand. - What was the first initial reaction with other cops, the guys who worked it when the story broke the next morning? - It was anger, frustration. Sorrow. - Today, if you mentioned Lillo Brancato's name to other cops, what would be the reaction? - I think most cops would be hate. You know, yeah, most cops would be just flat out hate. You know, it's just really one of those unfortunate things that can happen. Life can be very simple, but somehow us grownups, we can complicate things. - Mmh hmm. - And that was the product of something that just should never have happened. - [Steve] What do you think Pat would, what do you think his reaction would be to this? - Pat would love his head on a platter. - Right. - You know, especially, Pat mentioned he can be very animated and he's pro-cop to the max and that what's you want in somebody that's gonna represent you. But even cops screw up. - Right. - And there's cops that have hit bottom, whether it be alcohol or drugs. And he's human, this is one of the flaws of being human. - [Steve] So police officer to police officer. Why did you think it was important to come on and do this documentary? - Because the young police officer that lost his life did something that I think any other police officer would have done and it's unfortunate. Lillo Brancato is out and living his life and still can do things and the young officer is not. - The night the, actually it was in the morning when it happened. It was about 5:20 a.m. I was in my crime scene office. We received a phone call that an officer had been shot and he was likely to die. When I got there, the scene was, there was a lot of cops around the peripheral because there was, he was, the incident happened in the middle of the block - Mmh hmm. - And it went up to towards Westchester Avenue. - Mmh. - So there were a lot of cops around the peripheral of the scene. They had it marked off and the cops actually did a great job in preserving the scene because there was a lot of snow on the ground. - Mmh hmm. - If you were in actually, in Daniel's apartment, you could look right out his, he lived in a basement. You could look right out his window and you could see the window where Bancato and Armento tried to get in and they broke the window. It was directly across. He had a clear view and he actually went outside and went to approach them in the driveway. So, initially you don't know exactly how it went down because Armento was removed. He ran, him and Brancato ran towards Westchester Avenue and they both left a blood trail 'cuz Daniel actually hit them with every shot the he fired. He hit the both of them with every shot. He didn't miss them. So, a couple of the bullets and fragments actually came out. Now, they both left separate blood trails going down towards Westchester. Lillo actually made it to the vehicle that I believe was a Durango. It was on the corner, right, parked right around the corner on Westchester and there was blood all over it and that's where the officers had grabbed him. - Mmh hmm. - Armento was short of that. He dumped his gun right away. He was where the cops grabbed him and they were wearing really thin rubber gloves. - Mmh hmm. - I mean, you don't even see cheap gloves like that anymore in the emergency room. These were really, really cheap rubber gloves. And there was a couple of them over there where Armento was caught and there was one back at the window sill where they tried to get in and that's where we got Lillo's DNA from. From that particular glove. It'd be hard to get into the jury's mind. - Right. - I don't know, it might have come down to how the judge explained the law to them - Mmh hmm. - that they didn't find him guilty. - Right. - But they found him guilty. I was satisfied that at least they found him guilty of the burglary and he did do some time. - Right. - So hopefully he had time to reflect upon the people you hang out with. - Right. - So, I wrote on December 10th, 2005, the assigned, being me, along with Police Officer Demato, I was training him at the time, responded to 3117 Arnot Place to assist Detective Schwartz with a the sheer number of the Bronx Homicide Squad and the department, excuse me, the department investigation of a police involved shooting in which the North duty MOS and two perpetrators exchanged gunfire. The off duty MOS was removed to Jacobi Hospital prior to CSU arrival where he expired from his wound. He was shot once in the chest. The perpetrators were also removed to Jacobi prior to my arrival and are reportedly in critical condition and then I described the way, the services that I provide in terms of collecting the evidence. I think the fact that he was who he was, it might have had an affect on the jury. Might have had an affect on the way the whole case went. The same thing if you're in a car, somebody has a gun, if the police come and stop you, they pull you out and you have the gun on you, the only person gets charged is the person with the gun on them, but if that person throws the gun down on the floor, now everybody goes. - Right. - It's the same with narcotics, guns. So, being that he was involved in the burglary and a police officer was killed, he should have been charged and that's the law. - Took me awhile to decide to go forward in a case like this. I mean, so emotionally charged. Obviously, a police officer is dead. He was villainized in the press immediately. Made to be a monster. I have an astounding respect for police officers. I've represented, as you know, - Sure. - a lot of police officers in some very difficult times and I pride myself in helping out members of the force when they need me. This was obviously a difficult decision for me to make, but it was a decision that I was able to make pretty comfortably once I got to know Lillo and once I got to know the facts of this case. - [Steve] Sure and what was your first impression of Lillo at that time? - A sweet heart. Really a sweet heart of a guy. Not the guy I read about. Not the arrogant, you know, sort of abusive individual who was callous or anything like that. He was a sweet heart who clearly had lost control of his life, lost control of his life in the sense that drugs began to overwhelm him, take away the person that he was that made him so successful as a young boy, make him so loved by so many people. - Mmh hmm. - A lot of people really love Lillo Brancato. A lot of people care about Lillo Brancato and that's why, I think, this was so shocking to so many people. But as individual as a person, you know, look, I was a prosecutor. I've been a defense lawyer a long time. I like to not judge people based on Google searches. I don't judge people based on third party analysis, but on my own impressions and I had some tough questions for him when I first met him, but it was clear to me that there was a good soul inside that sort of hardened shell that had been eroded by years of drug abuse. After that case was resolved, I still represent the many cops - Right. - in their times of need, including the so-called infamous rape cops in New York who were acquitted of rape after being vilified for two years in the press as rapists. And the funny part about that is, the same people who were giving me a hard time during the Brancato case were the first ones to call me after the rape cop acquittal telling me how much I've done for the boys in blue and how much they appreciated my help. So, but that's all part of being a lawyer. I don't take it personally. Once I got to them about the facts of the case and the person, Lillo, it was clear to me that this was an individual who had no legal responsibility or moral responsibility for the death of that police officer, as tragic as it was. Another individual did and he's rightfully serving the rest of his life in jail. That's Armento. - A lot of people don't realize that house was his buddy's house. So, that's important to know. He wasn't randomly going around the neighbor trying to break into a home. I mean, this was Kenny's house. His buddy who had died just recently but Lillo didn't know it, but he had been there hundreds of times before - Right. - where Kenny supplied him with narcotics to get his fix. He went there with Armento that night and when he went there, they made a sufficient amount of noise where it's startled, awaken the neighbor who happened to be a New York City Police Officer. Of course, Lillo didn't know that. Lillo didn't know Steve Armento was carrying a gun. That was proven in the trial. And the police officer fired first and Armento returned fire and all this was obviously of great surprise to Brancato who was there to do what he'd done a hundred times before. So, there was no legal liability. I mean, it's easy to lump it together with another individual when a police officer's shot. That's our instinct as a civilized society and it's right in that sense to have a visceral reaction like that, because when a police officer dies, it's tragic, if anyone dies, it's tragedy. - Right. - But someone who gave their life to serve the community as police officers often do, it really creates a righteous sense of indignation and outrage. - Sure. - That's a good visceral reaction, but we also as a civilized society have to step back and look at the true facts and when I did in this case and when the jury did in this case, they came to the only right conclusion, which was Lillo Brancato was not responsible for this police officer's death. - 2005 when the whole incident happened, you had uniqueness of interviewing Lillo's family. And you got to speak to his mom and what was that whole thing like? - Well, I think that the climate at the time as a journalist, I remember first of all, when he got arrested, - Mmh hmm. - and it was a few months before, it was in June 2005 when he was arrested for an uncontrolled substance - Mmh hmm. - And I remember that made a lot of headlines because any time, - What were you doing it for at the time, if you don't mind me asking. - At the time, I remember thinking I knew who he was. He was certainly someone who had a great background. He was a New Yorker, you know. He was from Yonkers. - Right. - And I just remember hearing, oh, here's this guy, he got into drug problems. He's probably another celebrity with drug problems. We've done many interview like that and then when I found out what happened in December 2005, it was shocking, but to be suddenly charged with murder, - Right. - and also charged with robbery was also something very, very serious and then it became not just another celebrity caught up in drugs. It became something very, very serious and it was making headlines everywhere. - [Steve] Now, how did it come to pass that you got to, months later, interview Lillo's mom and how did that whole thing transpire? - I knew Mel Sacks and Mel Sacks was the attorney at the time. I knew Mel very well. I had interviewed him many times. I'd interview many of his clients through they years. He was probably, you know, if not the best or one of the best for sure criminal defense attorneys - Right. - in the country, not just in New York and Mel and I had a number of discussions and he reached out to me and said, "I would "like to give an exclusive to you "with Lillo Brancato's mother," and I thought, wow. I'll take it. It was interesting as a journalist because here I was interviewing her and I was looking right across from her and you could tell that this was a woman who was clearly heartbroken, who was so devastated. I thought she'd put a really human face on Lillo Brancato for the public. Our interview was shown all over the world. So many people saw that interview and the mother, I thought, was very heartfelt. Very compassionate and you couldn't help but feel heartbroken for the mother. - Right. - I remember her saying to me, "my son got a call, was going off "to a Christmas party and then I didn't see him again." And you could just tell that this was this mother who just loved her son. She adopted him - Right. - when he was a young boy. Really cared for him and knew he got mixed up in drugs, but was just shocked, shellshocked by everything that was happening. Clearly, he has paid his dues. I hope he uses this time also to inspire other children not to take the wrong path. Not to get mixed up in drugs. And I also hope that he uses the time to also honor law enforcement, too. Because I think he can have a powerful message and inspire other kids and he's also a great actor. I admired his acting back then and I think he's, you always want the best for someone. You want someone to have another chance and maybe there's an Academy award in his future, you never know. - It was one day, Robert De Niro said to me, he said, "Lillo, tomorrow I want you "to dress like you're doing to church. "Wear a collared shirt and I want you "to dress nice." He said, "we're gonna do what's called "a screen test." Now, I didn't know what that was but you know, we're gonna do a screen test and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually put you on film because film may make you look different. It may make you look, you know what I mean. - Right. - And I said, yeah. No problem. I remember I wore black slacks. Button down, white button down shirt, black shoes and I didn't know what I was gettin' myself into. At this point in time, I thought, you know, I'm C. I'm C, so I'm just sittin' there, I'm so nervous. I'm just sittin' there. My father's sittin' next to me. And then, I feel someone tap my shoulder and I look and said, "hey, how you doin', man." And he said to me, he said, "hey, how are ya." He goes, "I'm Phil Barbarino." He says, "I'm reading for C also." He goes, "it's me and you." Whoo, when he told me that I was like, oh wow. I guess I'm not the only, I guess I'm not the only guy and I know he got to this point because he was good also. - Right. - There was something that got him to this point. - Right. - Phil Barbarino was the kid who shot Sonny at the end of the movie. - Right. - Initially they were gonna make him C and he was 21, so the movie would have been a little different. It would have been him at 21 and his friends would have been around that age also, - Right. - so they would have been a little older. Who, by the way, still a very good friend of mine to this day, Phil. I remember, we did the scene when Sonny let me borrow his car and when I gave it back to him, he found something under the engine, under the hood that he thought I planted in his car and nearly got physical with me and wanted to know where'd you go in my car and I begged and pleaded, Sonny, I'm sorry. I didn't do anything, I'm tellin' ya'. I just went to pick up the girl. That was the scene. So, Phil read the scene first. Had the doors closed. All I can do is hear him. Me and my father were right outside and all you hear is Chazz, "where the fuck "did you go in my car!" And you hear slap, slap. You can hear him slapping this poor guy. He's slapping the crap out of him. What did I sign up for here, you know, 'cuz I'm thinking after he's done, I gotta go in there and he's gonna beat me up the same way. So, Phil came out and he's all disheveled. His hair was messed up. His shirt was ripped. He had hand prints on his face. So, I'm like, wow, boy, they really worked you over. They worked him over. So, I'm like, nervous. Now I'm nervous and you're gonna beat me on top of being nervous. So, I go in there and I, camera's roll and we did the scene and they didn't put their hands on me once. So, all weekend I didn't hear anything. I remember it was a Sunday night. This lady, Robin, called me and said, "Lillo, Bob "would like to see you tomorrow." I said okay and I knew this was gonna be the day. My life was gonna change in one way or another. So, I went down there with my father. Robert De Niro, his office was on the eighth floor. We used to go to the seventh floor. The eighth floor, you needed the key, but he had like a balcony where he could look down. So now, he would come out, he knew my father at this point and he's such a polite guy, Robert De Niro. He used to call my father, Mr. Brancato and he said, "hey, how you doin', Mr. Brancato." They used to speak in Italian. - Yeah. - They were right around the same age, also, you know. So, he said hello to my father and he said, "Lillo, come up." So, I go upstairs and you got Chazz and you got De Niro and De Niro's, he's just lookin' at me and he says, he was making his face and he says, "well, we liked "very much what you did." Now, that was ambiguous. - Right. - It could have been we liked very much what you did, but you know. - Right. - Or we like very much what you did and you got the part. [exhales heavily] Thank you, Bobby, you know, thank you. And to Chazz, thank you so much. I said, "is it okay if I go tell my father?" And when I went to tell my father, he came outside with me to the balcony. Had his arm around me and I told my father. I said, "Pop," I said, "I got the part." And my father just looked up, went like that. And I said, "you mind if I use your phone? "I'd like to call my mother." And Robert De Niro said, "yeah, go ahead." He said, "go use the one in the bathroom. "You'll have a little privacy." So, I went and I called my mother and I heard my mother screaming. My aunts were there, everybody, they were all going crazy, he got the part. Everybody's going crazy, you know, 'cuz my mom, she told everybody. My whole street, everybody was outside. Balloons and people whistling, "Lillo, congratulations!" I'm thinking to myself, life can't get any better than this. It was like perfect, man. Like living a dream. - Biggie said it best, more money, more problems. - Right. - You know what I'm saying. - Right. - You know, once you start to get in that money and the fame and things are coming at you real fast, you gotta keep up. - Right. - And sometimes, trying to keep up, you might fall. We had access to everything. We was on defjam, we was rollin' with rush. You know what I'm sayin'. They gave us everything we wanted. You know what I'm sayin'. To the models, the club life. Even before I met Jay, you know what I'm sayin', I was always goin' to the clubs and goin' to joints like Mars and underground clubs where hip hop kids weren't even allowed in, so I was always dibbling and dabbing in certain crowds, but it's always there in New York City. It's not hard to find. - I met Lillo in Italy, in Milan Italy, I think, at a, I used to do a little bit of print work and he did some print work as well and so I met him back stage at a fashion show and then I met him again in New York City and we used to hang around in the clubs a little bit and you know, he's a good dude. I've never actually get crazy. I mean, he was just of the most amiable, just very relaxed, authentic people you wanna meet. He was just of those kinda guys that you have an instant liking to him. You can understand why they canst him in the film because he was very, you know, he was likable, he is likable. I was completely taken back because it was unlike him, you know. And when I hear more details about the story, then I started to understand how someone like Lillo could have found himself in that situation and sort of guilty by osmosis or whatever it is, but so yeah, I was surprised. Celebrities, it hijacks the human ego and it gives people a sense of hubris where they just feel that they're untouchable and you know, this can't happen to me. - How you doin', my name's Lillo, I'm an addict. - [Group] Hey Lillo. - Paulie, thank you for sharing. You know, I know today's topic is hope and back before I ever came into these rooms, I didn't think was any hope, just because of the negative stigma attached to drug addiction and you don't want to tell anyone. You can't really go anywhere for help because everyone's gonna look at you like you're a piece of shit, a piece of garbage. And I didn't want to really let anyone know and as a result of that, I just kept getting deeper and deeper my addiction to the point where I was totally powerless. There was nothing I could do in my power to stop. I mean, it felt like there was a magnet in my mouth pulling the drugs and you know, as Mike said, I went away for some time also and it's because of my lack of self control when it came to drugs. And then when I got out of prison, I started coming to meetings, something that I never really did unless I was forced to do because of some case I going, whatever, and when I first started coming to meetings, I, the word hope was like the word that first came to mind, because everyone was so welcoming and you know, giving me their phone numbers and now it's like you have something behind you. You have a support system to fall back on if you're ever in a situation where you feel like you wanna use and I thank the people in these rooms so much, because if it wasn't and weren't for these rooms, I don't know where I'd be. So, yeah, thank you. I mean, this really saved my life. There's nothing worse than wasted fucking talent. You had this opportunity of a lifetime to become who you are right now. To be, I would have done anything to work with Abel Ferrara. I don't ever have to work again after this. That's the way I felt. The way I saw it was, I was still young, you know, so I was like, God, I've lost my right to party. I lost my right to have a good time, to be young, because I fucked with that drug. Like, that drug was just, then you, all bets are off after that. You can't do anything anymore. Now, you have to get sober and you gotta stay sober for the rest of your life. You don't even have to be an addict to become an heroin addict. You just have to take heroin five times and then you realize you don't know how to tie your shoes after your fifth time without out it. At least for me, that's how it was. I don't know if I was an addict or if I, if it made me an addict. I don't even know, but he, I knew that it was the beginning for him. All I know is Abel Ferrara, - Right. - had a massive drug problem. He was, he used to direct on his hands and knees, Abel. Hey, so I want you to do this. He'd be petting his hair and stuff and I remember even Lillo was like, what the fuck is this. - Right. - How are we gonna get anything done here. By the sixth day of shooting, I noticed that Lillo was not the same kid that started the movie with us. I remember we had one scene in a horse and carriage in central park and we were stealing shots because, A, we were shooting, winter time, we shooting snow storms and blizzards in winter time for, we were in a heat wave in New York. It was that really big heat wave and this fucking guy was puking off the side of the horse and carriage the whole time and I'm like, what's going on, are you sick? What's happening? And it took me a couple minutes to realize, it's like, this kid's doing heroin. He's doing drugs. He's fucking high as hell right now. He's not withdrawing 'cuz he's not a junkie yet. - Right. - He just got high. He's new at taking heroin 'cuz I was already, I had been already at a rehab and stuff and sober for a few years and I was like, wow, he was just starting, so I thought for sure he was getting high with Abel. I was annoyed, I was really mad at him. I was, I think I was more mad at the situation because I knew how hard it was for me and I'm like, don't go down this road. You have all this opportunity in front of you. Why would you ever do this? I was still pretty fresh, so, and they're watching Abel and it's like this is what you wanna be? This isn't like, I'm a party animal. I'm a Hollywood actor. I've just become famous, I wanna go out and part and enjoy the high life. This is, you must really hate yourself. Brad Renfro died right out of Deuces Wild. That was around the same time period, I think, that Lillo got in trouble, so now, you have these two really talented, and Brad Renfro was this gentle soul. A mess, you know, so sad. And Lillo and I reconnected this year. The reason why I'm even here talking to this camera, because I asked him if he would fill in for me along with a couple of other friends of mine who went through, who had jail time and came out on the other end and are trying to keep their lives in the straight and narrow and trying to help people. But that's when I reached out to Lillo and I said, will you go talk at this conference. So, my whole take on all of this stuff as much as it was awful and there's all this waste of talent is that he's turning it around, so is it wasted at this point? He's taking this experience and he's turning it into something that could help other people and something that's gonna work in his favor, I hope. Put him on a different path. I always tell, I asked him to speak at this thing, which was a, it's a reentry program. Kids coming out, people coming out of jail, not kids. People coming out of jail and not having a chance. They're scarred for life by that, so what other options? I mean, just go get fucking high again, like I can't even be a part of society now because I fucked up? I see it a different way. I see a lot of people who had drug problems as being highly sensitive people. People who forget about even their problems, it's how you carry your problems and how you handle them and people like us handle them in this very self destructive kind of way, but you can turn that into something magical. I believe that, I really believe that. - You finished? [guzzling] [thuds] - Thank you, T. - Was that sugarless, motherfucker? The last fuckin' drink you're ever gonna have. [sobbing] - For the sake of God, Marty. [shouting] - [Steve] There was speculation and rumors that James Gandolfini actually took you to the side on the site of Sopranos and gave you some words of wisdom, some advice. Can you elaborate on what that was? - Basically just told me that, "you have "something really good going for yourself, "being given the opportunity to be "in such TV shows and films, it's a blessing." And you know, "you should be really careful "in the decisions that you make "and the life that you live, to not squander this." And you know, I guess since back then I hadn't reached that moment of clarity, I kind of brushed off what he said and I shouldn't have. But now that I can look back in hindsight, wow, that was some pretty great advice from a legend. - I met Lillo when he was shooting Renaissance Man with, through Mark Wahlberg who was a friend of mine. I met with him and Randy, who introduced me to him. - [Steve] And how did you guys become tight? - Me and Lillo were tight from the beginning. We just were naturally very, became friends. A lot of similar interests and we just always find him an interesting guy to talk to. It's a very interesting commentary, especially about acting and stuff. It's interesting, the first year he was in prison, he was just as messed up as he was before and I was really angry at him and we had a lot of conversations where I really, really, we had some tough conversations where I, 'cuz as much as I'm his friend, as much as I want to be there for him as a friend, it was, I was very angry because of the loss of life. I knew he didn't shoot the guy. I knew he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he's still responsible for being there. You know, I always knew, I was always afraid Lillo was gonna hurt himself. I really, I thought he was gonna die. I knew he was gonna die if he didn't stop and I kept telling him and that I kept, I did everything in my power to convince him that he's on a road where he's going to die, so I always expected that. I never expected him to hurt somebody else. That was the shocking thing and of course, when the truth came out, he certainly didn't hurt anyone else. He was there, but even being there was upsetting for me and it made me, I was very disappointed in him. I love the guy, he's an old friend, but you know, someone loses their life. A police officer. Just, it's heart breaking and I was really angry with him from the first time. - [Steve] What was the reaction from friends and family that knew you were close with him, that's after the incident happened. - Most of my friends called me and said you gotta get away from this guy. He's gonna be nothing but trouble for you. Some people put a lot of pressure on me to get away from, some of my family and a lot of other people. He really was a pariah. But you know, the way I look at it, he's my friend and he was my friend when he was a movie star. He's still gonna be my friend when he's in his worst point in his life. That's what friends are for. I wouldn't have left him. As a friend, I would never leave him. - [Steve] Did you lose friends because of him? - I did lose some friends because of him. - [Steve] Did you lose family members because of him? - Yes. - How did I meet Lillo? Just with the Rat Pack we used to run with in the city. Lillo was the hottest young actor on the scene right then and running with our little A-listers, here comes Lillo out of nowhere in the Bronx Tale and just took New York by storm and met him down at Scores. [laughing] Gentlemen's club also and one day he was like, hey, you wanna give me a ride home? I said, naw, man, I've been drinking, but here goes, "my car keys" and he took the car keys and he went in a brand new 600 Mercedes. Young 18 year old kid and we bonded right after that. Lillo was two different people. See, we have a disease that tells us we don't have a disease. So when Lillo was sober, Lillo was the best person in the world. When Lillo was getting high, then Lillo was a whole different person and I could tell you stories with, when we'd be at a hotel room and have a bunch of women and you're partying and Lillo will start doing drugs and you could just see the demon just taking Lillo on. Not where he's violent, but when paranoia would set in. Between you and I, bro, I see how sick you are and sick I was, we gotta keep each other accountable. You know? [Lillo mumbles] You know I love you, man. - I love you, too. I think also, if I didn't go out that night, my life wouldn't have been saved, you know. - Right, but you know, we wouldn't have cost two lives, you know. And we gotta look at it where, and you know we talk about this all the time, on the phone and doing devotionals and stuff. We know it's not all about us. We ain't self centered about it no more. If we could take this all back and bring back our victims, we definitely will. All we can do right now, we apologize. We're sorry and God is not a God of second chance. He's a God of another chance 'cuz we've been through our second chances. - Right. - Just hope our family and their family be patient with us and know that we're sick. Lillo, when Lillo did cocaine, he would take a picture off the wall, look for a microphone, look for a camera, go under the bed, go everywhere, just like you never seen before. Just almost like he was allergic to cocaine and nobody on the party scene had it worse than Lillo. I could tell you this, we had a photoshoot at my house for charity and Lillo, during the day, sober, great human being. A lot of energy, a lot of compassion. A lot of empathy toward the foundation and toward the people. People loved him and then as the night went on, he started drinking and the cocaine would come in, Lillo would right away, go into something else. It was so bad that I had a large house right out in this area and I came home, maybe three days after the function, went into a bedroom downstairs. We had a big place, 16 bedrooms. I don't know why I went down there. I opened up the closet to get something. I don't know why I was down there. 'Cuz I opened it up and Lillo was still here. - How many years sober are you? - I can probably say that on this past November 18th, 2017, celebrated 11 years. - [Steve] How's that feel? - It feels tremendous. I mean, it's not something I can say that gets easier every day, but it gets more rewarding every day. While I was away, one of the best things that I learned is how to manage my emotions and what I learned from experience was that no matter how bad a situation gets, either your ability to deal with it will get better or the situation itself will get better. And then I came to a realization that I don't need drugs. That God has equipped me with what's necessary to overcome pretty much anything and that is one of the biggest tools that I use to keep sober until this day. - Before I bet Lillo, an actor by the name of Phil Barbarino had the part of C and I was going in for Mario and then Jill Greenburg told us unofficially that it was, Phil was gonna play C and I was gonna play Crazy Mario and I think she said, I think Joey had the part maybe even before us. Joey from Goodfellas, so Joey was gonna play Slick. And she told us this unofficially that we were those characters. - [Steve] Now, how did you guys feel knowing that this guy just came out of nowhere. - Well at first, we, I was on Phil's side. At first, so I was like, this kid. Don't worry, Phil, I said, he doesn't have a shot, but I knew he had a shot. - Right. - And then when I saw him act, I thought he was fantastic. I thought he was fantastic and I believed that he was from the Bronx and he had that Bronx accent. I don't know if Lillo put it on or if he just, maybe it's a Yonkers accent that was close to the Bronx, but he also spoke, he also speaks Italian and Spanish and stuff like that, so he was able to do the Bronx accent perfect. I'm from the Bronx - Right. - So, I know a Bronx accent when I hear it. He had it. After Bronx Tale we actually did, we worked again together. We knew each other's families, also, from being on set, so I knew his mom and dad and he knew my mom and dad, my brothers. And Lillo has amazing memory, too, 'cuz he saw me years later and asked my family by name, which was impressive. But after Bronx Tale, we had done, we had done a show called Falcone about, it was a spin off of Danny Brasco and it was James Russo. Titus Welliver was in it. It was a, Bobby Moresco, I think, directed it. Anyway, it was gonna be a big series and I was playing Nicky, the kid. He was playing one of the wise guys. And he was a regular in it. I was gonna be, I think, a recurring. Something like that, but he was a regular. And then they killed him off and I was surprised that they killed him off. I don't know the real story, you can ask Lillo about it. But I remember him coming, if we had a six or seven o'clock a.m. call time, he'd come in wired from the night before, not sleeping, he had the black under his eyes and I knew he was out from the night before. He looked terrible and that's when I knew and then we met out a couple of times. We didn't go out together, but I'd go to a club or an opening for something or an event and he'd be there and he was with these kids. I forgot their names, they're just weirdos. I mean, this kid Rob used to wear these contact lenses that were just so weird. Terrible piece on his head. They were just all around him. They were obviously enabling him. His family were builders in Yonkers. They had a lot of money and they did very, very well. His father worked like, I've never seen anybody work like his father, like a bull, until he had the heart problem, but his father was a great guy. Worked really, really hard. I remember Lillo always looked great. He always drove cool cars and stuff like that and then I saw him in the club once, he had a hole in his sweater. He had mangled shoes on and he asked me for $20 or something like that and I said, you're asking me. I should be asking you. [high pitched shouting] - Hugs and smiles during the homecoming this afternoon. Three and a half hours after his release from an upstate prison this morning, former actor Lillo Brancato arrived in Yonkers a free man. - It's a very big day. Thank you all for coming. I just wanna spend some time with my family. - When you turn this corner, what goes on in your mind. - A lot of memories, you know. I grew up here. A lot of good memories that all become the bad memories. A lot of guys that I knew from this neighborhood died, drugs. Guys I was really, really close to. I remembering taking care of my friend, Jimmy. They used to call him Aruba. He passed away in 2009 and he used to smoke crack and I did also, but I wasn't, you know, doing it every day. He told me, he said, "Li, you know what. "You keep messing with that crack pipe, "one day it's gonna get you." I remember the day that it got me. It was in this very, very, this very parking space right here, this parkin' spot. I was walking into the store to get cigarettes and this guys parked in this car and was speaking loud, that they wanted me to hear it. They guy said, the guys said, he goes, "oh, Lillo's a good guy. "He never forgot where he came from." So automatically, I'm curious. I didn't, I've seen him around. I knew who they were, so I walked over to the car and I remember I looked in the car. I said, hey guys, how you doin'. The guy's lookin' at me, said, "yeah, I'm alright." And sitting down, pulls out a crack pipe and he looks at me. He didn't raise it up so high so we could see it from outside. It was down here and he said, he said, "you interested?" and I knew what that was gonna be. Once I take that first hit of crack, I could be out for two days, a week. And I said, yeah, yeah, I'm interested. I got in the back seat of the car. I remember we took a ride up this street and we came around and the crack pipe was full of resin, - Right. - So I said to the guys, I said, no, no, no. He was ready to put a rock in there. And I said, no, no, no, it's fine. I'll just, he goes no, no, no. He said, "if you're gonna do it, you do "it the right way." I remember he put a $20 rock inside the pipe and I remember when I took that hit, that was it. That was it. From that day in July of 2005 until the day I got arrested, December 10th, 2005, I did not miss one day. I smoked crack every single day and that crack pipe got a real hold on me to the point where I used to be in my room, look at the mirror and I was a shadow of myself. I was about 135 pounds. I looked like a skeleton and I would literally like, so powerless, and I used to look in the mirror crying. Please God, please help me, help me please. - [Steve] So when you see this neighborhood, does it bring back more bad or more good memories? - I would say more bad memories, but now that I have reached the moment of clarity, I kinda deal with it a little bit better and just am so thankful that that I did make it out and that I am safe and sound and I am a, that I am in a better place in life. And thank God for that. - Right. - Because without Him, none of that would have been possible. - [Steve] The iconic, the working man is a sucker. What are your thoughts on that? - Well, my old thoughts, I would probably have to say that I believe the exact opposite. That the working man is not a sucker. My father's a Mason, a builder and worked really, really hard and I can tell you this. He's far from a sucker. - Well, my relationship with Lillo was like my relationship with a lot of young studs coming up in New York. Gettin' in the movie game and the early '90s to mid '90s when I was running an big gossip column in the New York Daily News, I was in contact with all those guys, all the young bucks, and you know, I remember the movie premier specifically for Bronx Tale, because it was a big to-do. It was in Tribeca. Bob De Niro directing. I remember there was a big thing with, a lot of people couldn't get in and you know, Lillo was about to be crowned as this new actor that was gonna make some noise for a long time. And frankly, you left that screening or the premier saying this kid fucking held his own with Bob De Niro and Chazz Palminteri, heavyweights, he's gonna be around forever. Lillo didn't make me an enemy. I never sought, I never went after him. 'Cuz you gotta understand, as an Italian guy, there's a certain amount of movies, a certain amount of movie us Italians see that come on TV and you put the remote and you can throw the remote away. When you turn on Rocky or Godfather or Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Bronx Tale, Casino even, you're done for the next two hours. And when you're one of the stars in those movies, you're like royalty to us. So, I would never go out of my way to write something bad about Lillo, but it was getting increasingly harder not to because there were altercations and fights and arguments that warranted attention in the columns. There was a club uptown called Rouge that a lot of the monsters stayed at and big time guys. Genovese guys, Gambino guys. They all converged there. These are fuckin' killers. They don't take shit. Polito would have worked in there with the same attitude like he was running his own show and those guys wouldn't have it. And again, he's treated a certain way because he's from a certain movie with a certain actor and they put kid gloves on, but there came a time when he wasn't allowed back in that club and that's a big blow to a kid like that. I think he has a shot to break in again because he had some talent and I'm sure he still has some talent. Up until recently, everybody in this town got a second chance. I don't care if your were Mel Gibson and started a race war on the PCH or Woody Allen who married his adopted daughter. I mean, you get second chances in this town, in this business. Right now, the climate in Hollywood is, anything you did bad as a man, you're done. What Lillo did didn't have anything of a sexual nature to it, so if it's simply a matter of breaking the law, it's a tough spot, but I think he certainly has the ability to come back if he wants to. That's why that movie resounded in all of us, because I've lived a life where sometimes you're not using the talent that God bestowed you and when you're not using it, things go bad in life and you can really expect to find yourself on your ass. When you accept that you have this talent that God gave you, you make your living with it, it's truly the gift that God gave you, good things are gonna happen. I think Lillo has a gift and got a gift from God. He fucked his life up, but I don't think that gift left him and I think there's somebody out there that's gonna put their hands out and allow him back into the scene. - When you start working in film and TV business and make a little bit if of money, you know for me, I lived at home with my parents. Went to boarding school. I was very, lived in a sort of insulated bubble and never really had to worry too much about money, never had to worry about buying stuff, so I never had a lot of cash on me. Never had a bank account or anything like that. When I started working a lot in New York City, it's not just having, being recognizable or being the new hot guy or whatever they call it, but it's all the sudden having, being 18 or 19 and having $150,000 cash in your bank account. [laughs] - [Steve] Right, could have been at that point, that's like 10 million at that age. - Right and you're working on jobs and you're making 50 here, 75, 100 and it's just growing in your bank account and really, you know, when you have that kind of cash and never had that kind of cash before, I just didn't see there was no limit to what I could do. So, that and sort of the access, really it's the money that creates the access and so, the drugs, you know, all that stuff becomes very available because you're supplying the drugs and the alcohol for a lot of the friends. So, they'll be finding stuff for you 'cuz you're footing the bill, - Right. - And it's, it's constant and never ending. - So, I would be remiss if I didn't ask the question that's probably the most important question in this whole documentary. Do you feel like you got away with murder? - Well, I've always taken full responsibility for how my addiction and my, you know, decision making made a contribution in the death of the heroic police officer. But with that being said, I don't feel that I was directly responsible for the death, so therefore, no, I don't think I was, or got away with murder. - What were your initial thoughts when you first heard about the whole incident? - Before we even knew who it was, it was another cop murder. - Were you working the night of or no? - I was off that night actually. - Okay. - But a few weeks or months prior, another officer was killed. I think it was Officer Dylan Stewart. So, yeah, immediately, just the initial reports that another officer killed. I mean, any officer killed struck us, but two almost back to back, and then when we heard who it was, someone kind of privileged who probably had a lot goin' for him, that struck an even deeper nerve in pretty much all of us. - What was the, if you can remember, what was the initial reaction around the precinct when, you know, around the funeral time or right after it happened? - Everyone in general was mad, livid. Not just because of what happened, but again, because of who it was and that he was, what we view, as a privileged person. How could this have happened? How could he been involved and then kind of also a feeling of like, almost being backstabbed because, I think, in general, a lot of us liked Lillo from Bronx Tale. - Right. - So, we liked the movie. We liked him. I talked to a few today, actually, about this and -- - [Steve] What were their thoughts? - Like it was yesterday. He was a scumbag. He's a perp. He's a piece of shit. You know, he should still be in jail. He should have gotten the death penalty. So on and so forth. - Right. - I've yet to find anyone in NYPD who has anything positive to say about it. - Do you think he deserves a second chance, if not why? [siren blaring] - I don't and I don't because, I do believe in second chances, but for me, this was too egregious to deserve a second chance and from interviews I saw with people who used to work with him, Chazz Palminteri, I think. I think I've seen a few interviews with him back then, he said that he had heard he'd been involved in drug activity and so on and he tried to steer him clear and he told him this is gonna lead to trouble. So, it sounded like there were probably people around him who tried to steer him clear from that bad element he was getting into and he didn't listen. This, things like this happen when you're involved in that activity and to me, this is something that's not worthy of a second chance. - Why did you think it was important to do this documentary from a cop's side of things? - I figured the public just needs to know how the cops feel. In particular NYPD cops. That the feeling hasn't changed. I hate to use the word hate, but I'm gonna use the word hate. Everyone that I know at NYPD that had mentioned Bracato's name, they hate him. Still consider him a scumbag. Piece of shit, worthless. And wouldn't see any movie or a project with him in it and I felt it was just important to make that known. - Well, you know, this is Saint Ann's Church. This is where I did my first communion back in 1984. It's where I did my confirmation in 1990. I don't live too far from here. Maybe like two minutes down the street. And you know, this church has a lot of meaning to me. I mean, it's like part of my childhood. It's part of who I am. And you know, and really, only after I was incarcerated did I really realize the importance of having God in your life, you know, because of the bad mistakes and the choices that I made in my life and what they resulted in. A lot of people left my side. A lot of people that were near and dear to me. People that I loved. They just weren't there for me. Not everyone. But one person who never left my side was God, He was always there and I now know because of what I went through and the changes in my life of who I was and then who I became the day that I was released. Funny how life works itself out because, you know, 25 years later at least, right next door to this church, which is part of this church, is where they have parties and stuff, is where I attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings. God does exist. This is why I try to go to church as much as possible and I thank God every day. Every day of my life before I do anything, I pray for at least 10 minutes to thank Him for giving me the strength to become the person that I am today. You know, it's, I owe it all to Him. So, here I am. [somber organ music] - I feel as though he got the right amount of time just because he did do a robbery. There was a weapon involved and knowing the laws and actually having an ex-boyfriend who went to jail for the same thing, that's what he got. He got 10 years and did 85% of his time and I feel as though that was fair. - It's so easy to get bored and so then, the next thing is, what's next. I've got everything. Like, what else is there? And so, drugs and alcohol and whatever comes into the picture inevitably, and it almost always, it's so hard to navigate yourself through that world. - I think that Lillo is a great artist and wanted to keep working and you know, at the end of the day, I think it does, it does put a bit of a shadow over all the amazing work that he has done. - [Steve] Somebody's watching this documentary who didn't know Lillo or don't know him obviously personally or don't know much about him, what would you like them to know about him that maybe somebody wouldn't know? - That's he's a different person. He's dedicated to his, you know, to his job and his career and he's a good kid. He's a really good kid. He got great heart, you know. What he's did, whatever happened to him, it was just, it was from the drugs, nothing else. [applauding] - Thank you. - Thank you, thank you.
