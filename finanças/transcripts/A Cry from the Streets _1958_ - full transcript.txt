(uplifting theme music) (mysterious music) My mom! My mommy! Mommy! My mom! My mom! (melancholy music) Oh hello Mrs. Jenks. Oh come in Miss. Sorry I couldn't get here sooner. How's poor Mrs. Taylor? She died an hour ago. Wherever did Taylor get the gun from? He'll be up for murder of course. What's to become of their kids? That's what I'm here for Mrs. Jenks, can I see them? "To the woods and there they lived happily ever after. "And as for the old woman she was never heard of again." Hello Barbie. I'll tell you another story. "Once upon time there lived two children who lived"... You couldn't keep them just for a few days could you Mrs. Jenks? You must take them, I can't have 'em sleeping here. I'm done up already. Yes I know you've been wonderful Mrs. Jenks. It's just finding room for all three. I could put them in different homes I suppose. Now none of that now, you don't split us up. They can't do without me. Well I suppose I'll just have to try and squeeze them into Rattler House for tonight anyway. I'll get their case. Thank you Mrs. Jenks. Well we're going to try and find a nice new home. That'll be fun won't it? As long as we with Barbie. They ain't had no tea. Oh well then we must try and find some musn't we? Where's my mom? Go on blow. Come on let's all go and have tea together. There, that's the boy. Come on Taylor, you'd better get washed. (soft music) Alright, thank you, come on children. Would you mind if we sat here? Now Barbie you look after Tony. And don't drop it on the floor. Let's bet you're hungry Tony hey? He's always hungry. Want the sugar Miss? No thank you Barbie I don't take it. Oh no sugar. Come on now have some milk. Come on Alec, come on. Go on, drink your milk, give you big muscles. Oh I'll tell my mom. Oh he doesn't need it does he? Alec you shouldn't do that, I'm sorry. It's alright. No, alright you have it later dear. We came here with mom Barbie didn't we? You shut up and eat your tea. Look out for the cup! Oh I'm so sorry. Pity you don't take sugar with it, I prefer it with sugar. You shouldn't do that. I'm afraid it'll stain. That's alright, it's only an old one. These are not your kids are they? No I'm looking after them. Oh some people like sleeping on nails don't they, ta da. Hey miss, what's this place we're going to? What Rattler House? Oh you'll like it, there's lots of other children there. Any grown ups? Yes of course, they're going to look after you. Barbie looks after Alec and me, don't you Barbie? [Ann] Yes well someone's gotta look after Barbie. I can look after meself. Well we'll see. Come on, eat up. - Try some milk. - No. - Oh come on. - No. (melancholy music) Now children, in you go. Hello Tim, whatcha doing out here? I'm watching for me dad. Come on children. (melancholy music) Oh Mr. Daniels, Tim's at the gate. Say's he's waiting for his daddy. That's just a craze, he'll get over that. By the way, what about these children? Oh we've got a new family for you. We weren't informed you know. Yes I know, there wasn't time. Now if you'll take this. Really Miss Fairlie, I don't know what my wife's gonna say about this. I do, but this is an emergency. Ah, off those beds! Oh go fry your face. I won't go in, I don't want to go in. You come back, come back you naughty boy! Oh Mrs. Daniels, I'm afraid you're going to be a little overcrowded tonight. But Miss Fairlie, you know we're quite full. Yes I know but it's only for one night. Quite impossible, I could manage one or two perhaps but certainly not three. I want to go home. Shut up, you get on my nerves. Who are they? This is Barbie Taylor and her brothers Alec and Tony. Did you say Taylor? Yes. Well they'd better come into the playroom while we decide what's to be done. There's some camp beds somewhere, have a look in the box room Godfrey. Come on kids. (kids yelling) Miss Percival, now this Aunty Sally, she'll look after you for a little while. Keep them amused but don't question them. Now be good children, it'll be supper time soon. We just had tea. Look Miss, look what I drawed. - You did? - Yes. Well that's wonderful, what is it? Mrs. Daniels. (kids laughing) Miss Fairlie. Aw Miss tell us a story. Miss you gonna stay for dinner? Hello Georgie, how are you? Alright thanks, I got a letter from my Nan. Did you Georgie? Yeah. Miss when is my mommy coming home? She'll come back soon, you'll see. Hi Miss Fairlie. Hello Derek. Hey boys, you heard this one? Oh shut up, we've got our own work to do. Saw my brother today. He gave me some pegs. I'll swap you mine if you like. I don't use 'em. Go on, you're a sissy. Why don't you turn it up? [Derek] Yeah my brother says he took a girl out. [Don] Why don't you quit talking about your brother? Don, can I have a word with you? [Don] Hello, miss. Don, the Taylors may not be staying but I want you to keep an eye on them. What do you think I am, a wet nurse? They've had a rough time, Don. They ain't the only ones. I know but you're the oldest here. Help them if you can. Any news for me yet? No, not yet, Don. I reckon you're trying. Oh, Don. I'm sorry but you've got to find my mom. You promised. Yes I know but eight years is a long time. Now be patient. (kids playing) Hello children. This is a nice garden, isn't it? Lots of nice new friends to play with. We don't want no new friends. We got our friends. I want to play in the road, Barbie. Mrs. Daniels doesn't allow the children to play in the road. Well, we won't play at all. No, we won't play at all. Well upon my soap. Now I don't want to hear any more arguments. You'll sleep one in each dorm like good children. I told you, Alec can't sleep by himself. He's too small. Of course he can. I can't sleep without you, Barbie. Tony has nightmares if he's alone all about being chased by Johns with red hot pokers. Well you can't all sleep in the same room here. [Barbie] Why can't we? Because for one thing, there isn't room for three extra beds. Now don't argue. Who wants three beds? We only have one in our home. And you're not at home here. Miss Percival. [Sally] Yes, Mrs. Daniels? See these children wash themselves properly. I imagine they need it. They ain't dirty. I washed 'em. Come along. [Boy] Barbie! Okay, I'm coming. Susan. Go along now. Sleep in one bed indeed! There'll be trouble if we don't. (sobbing) Never mind, it's alright, Barbie's here. Why don't you stop it? You come and get in Barbie's bed. Never mind, I'll take you into my bed. Now where do you think you're going? I'm taking Alec into my bedroom. You can't do that, you know? You'll cop it, from Mrs. Daniels. I'm not afraid of her. [Tony] Barbie! - Barbie! - Now look what you've done. You've woken Tony up. [Tony] Get off of me! It's alright. [Tony] I'm frightened. [Barbie] Never mind. Why don't you two shut up? [Barbie] Never mind, darling. It's alright, Barbie's here. [Don] Now what do you think you're doing, eh? He's coming into my room. Look, I told you, boys ain't allowed in the girls dorm. Well they've gotta sleep somewhere. Look, if these two stay together, will that do? [Barbie] Alright. Come on, sit down, that's a good boy. Oh no, it's no good, they'll fall out. Now where are you going? Into this bed. This is my bed. I know but it's bigger. So where am I supposed to sleep, eh? In there, it's very comfortable. You'll like it. Don't worry about it. It's alright. # The more we are together, together, together # The more we are together, the merrier we'll be # Your friends are my friends # And my friends are your friends # And the more we are together, the merrier we'll be (harmonica music) Oh no, don't you start. What are you here for? Are your mom and dad dead? Oh, I've got a mum. She's a real famous actress and she goes all around the world acting on the stage. That's why I live here. She's gonna come and take me away soon and I'm gonna be a real famous musician. I'm gonna have lessons. I can play real tunes now. I bet you can. I bet I can. I'll show you, look. (harmonica music) Blimey, this is worse than Friday night at home. I must say I don't know what else you could've done with them. I pray there wasn't anything else. You were asking for trouble, of course. That's nothing new. Oh Rachel, if you'd only seen those three sad little things. My dear, Ann, I've been dealing with sad little things just like the Taylors for the last 25 years. Do try to remember, it's part of your job as a children's officer not to get emotionally involved. I'm sorry, Rachel, but I can't think of children just as cards in a file. Believe me, I know how you feel. After all I made the same mistakes when I was doing your job. I bet you weren't as much trouble as I am. Well I'll get the Taylor children officially registered for Rattler House. Thank you, Rachel. Oh by the way, while we're on the subject of Rattler House, when are you going to replace the Daniels? Now I know they're not perfect but they are experienced and it's not easy to find people who are willing to devote their lives to that kind of work so just you get on with them. You try telling that to the children. Oh, I think I've got something that'll cheer you up. [Ann] Oh? There's news of Don Farrer's mother. What? [Rachel] At least it sounds like his mother but we only know where she works. Well where? You'll never believe it, practically across the street. They've got the details in the outer office. Oh, that's wonderful. Ann. [Ann] Yes? Make sure it is her and then tell Don. Yes of course, Rachel and thanks. (happy music) Hello Tim. Hello miss. Come along, children. Tea's ready. Come along, Georgie. - Tea's ready. - Mrs. Daniels, I've brought some clothes and shoes for the Taylor children. Oh by the way, did Mrs. Seymour ring you about them? She did. It's disgraceful. I shall protest to the committee. Now, Mrs. Daniels, it's your job and mine to look after deprived children. You said one night. Had I know this would happen... You'd still have taken them, now wouldn't you? Mrs. Daniels, I've brought you and Miss Fairlie some tea. Hello, Don. Alright, take it into the office. I'll be in in a minute. Fine time that Taylor girl gave me last night. Yes, why? You know where she had me finish up? No. In the little one's camp bed. Oh, it's all very funny for you to laugh, isn't it? Well when I woke up this morning I was so stiff I went flat on me chest. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh no, not again. I told you I prefer it with sugar. You are an electrician, are you? A magician, more like it. Who did this wiring? I did. Any objections? No, not if you don't mind burning down the house. Yeah, well, you chaps have got to make jobs for yourselves, I suppose. Oh, you know all about electricity, do ya? Yeah. Pass me the Phillips screwdriver will ya? That's just where you're wrong, Mr. Cocky. It's the little one. How was I to know? I never seen one like this before. Well, you can't do a proper job without the right tools, can you mate? No. You've got some smashing tools. Yeah, and they've all been counted. Don, why aren't you in the dining room? Go along at once now. Haven't you finished yet? I'm sorry, misses, this job'll take another three days. I've got to rewire the lot. Did Miss Seymour tell you the news about Don's mother? She did. Isn't it wonderful? That remains to be seen, Miss Fairlie. Here's the report on Gloria Jane that you asked for. Happy soul, isn't she? Just like her mother, Dracula's mother. I don't think she wants Don to know yet just in case it's a mistake. I thought all the kids here were orphans. Oh no, some of them are. Others, well, Don Farrer's a typical case. His father knocker his mother out until she ran away and he knocked on about too until he ran away. He lived a fortnight on his own in the streets till the police picked him up. He was just eights years old at the time. Didn't they pick the old man up? Oh yes. Yes, he went to gaol. We've been looking for Mrs. Farrer ever since. Now we think we've found her. And you mean to say the kid still wants her back? It's his one ambition. I don't get it. Well, he just wants to belong to someone. Suppose she doesn't want him back? Well that's why I've got to see her first, tonight I hope. She's a night worker at Kings Cross. Yeah, miss, that's a funny old district for a girl to be walking about by herself. Oh, I'm used to taking care of myself. Miss, about this Kings Cross tonight, I've been thinking, I've got a car. It's a four seater but it could take two. And? Well, do you want a lift? You don't waste time, do you Mr...? Lowther, Bill Lowther. Do you want a lift? [Ann] No. Good, what time shall I pick you up? You've certainly got plenty of initiative, - haven't you Mr. Lowther? - Look miss, all I've done is offer you a lift. Does that mean I have to become one of your cases? I'll pick you up. Well, alright. Where do you live? Eight Stanley Circus but I... 11:30 alright? [Ann] Well thank you. It's my pleasure. Half past 11. (playful music) Kings Cross, all change please. How long will you be miss? Oh goodness only knows. I've got to find her first. Alright, I'll wait here then. Oh no, you mustn't wait. What, let you walk through this part of London all by yourself? Now look, Mr. Lowther, as I said before, I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. Alright, then. I'm sorry but you mustn't wait. Alright. Good night. Good night. No trains out at this time, dear. Yes I know. I'm looking for Mrs. Farrer. Oh, she's at the platform. I'll get her for you, shall I? Yes please. You wait in there. Thank you. Hey May, someone wants to see you. See me, what ever for? Search me. It's a young lady. She's in the waiting room. Well, I better see her. You can't go yet. We got to get these carriages done by midnight. Oh, stop going on in there. She won't take long. It's all very well for you but I've got to go down and do her bits. Oh really, don't go on. We don't clean them anyway, do we? Oh you may not but I do, I'll have you know. Mrs. Farrer? What is it? My name's Fairlie. I'm from the children's department in the town hall. You know, it's about Don. You are his mother, aren't you? Yes, I can see you are. No, I'm not. I never heard of no Don. No, I won't look. I don't know nothing about him. Oh please, Mrs. Farrer, it's a good photograph of him. I took it myself. This ain't my Don. He's grown a bit since you saw him last, hasn't he? He wants to see you. Why should he want to see my anyway? I never did him no good. Well, it's natural enough isn't it? He's growing up now. He wants someone to belong to. So long ago, nearly eight years. He'll have forgotten what I look like. Well, it's time you reminded him. I wouldn't know what to say. Perhaps we could talk about it another time at home. At home? Yes, I could pop in for a cup of tea. What's your address? Five Telfort Street up Yards Road but I don't... Good, that's settled. I'll tell Don I've seen you. He really does want to see me, after all I've done to him? He's living for the day. Oh alright then. Oh no, no, no, that's for you. Oh thank you, miss. Give him my love, miss. Yes, I will. Taxi miss. I thought I told you not to wait. Oh well, I changed my mind. Cold standing out here. Would you like a cup of coffee? Coffee, where? At the Ritz. [Ann] Can we have a table near the orchestra? Two coffees please. Would you like something to eat? [Ann] No thanks. Cheese sandwich, hot pie, saveloy? - No thank you. - No? I'll bring you out again. Do you come from London? No, no, I come from Yorkshire right out on the Moors. People think I'm crazy to do a job like this. Yeah, I do too. Did you see the kid's mom over there? Yes, yes, I found her. Now at last Don's got a future. Now all he needs is a job. You couldn't help him, could you? He's mad about electricity. Oh no, a kid like that'd only be in the way. You're not interested in children, are you? I'm not interested in them like you are. I leave that to the people whose job it is like Rattler House. Even that isn't perfect. They're just one of a crowd there. Well then they find these, what'd you call 'em these foster parents? Yes. They're very difficult to find and when you do find 'em, they usually only want one and a girl at that. Boys are too much trouble. Not always. You'd go for a boy, would you? I'm not thinking of fostering anybody. Hello son. [Tim] I thought you was me dad. Come along, Tim, you'll be late for dinner. (bell ringing) (kids yelling) Go on son, grub up. [Male] Come on, Barbie. (kids yelling) Barbie Taylor, you know perfectly well that is not allowed. No I don't, he said I could. That's enough. He done it first. I didn't. He did do it, I saw him. There you are. Derek dear, did you slide down the bannisters? Of course I didn't, auntie. I know it's not allowed. You're a liar. Barbie. Now come along into the dining room. Miss Percival, Barbie Taylor is to have no rice pudding today. She's been very rude and disobedient. Yes, Miss Daniel. You can half of mine, Barbie. I don't care. I don't like rice pudding. That's enough. Now get along with you into the dining room. Go along, Derek dear. Yes auntie. Excuse me, Mrs. Daniels, I didn't want to say anything while the kids were here but I saw what happened and it wasn't Barbie... I don't want to hear anymore about it. I won't have them sliding down the bannisters. This is my home, you know, as well as there's. Hey mister, I'm late. Catch me. Hey! That was super. Yeah, who taught you to do that? My mum. What'd your mom do, get fired out of a cannon? Oh, my mom's an actress. She's real funny. She can do cartwheels. You're mom's real clever, ain't she? Yeah, because she can do the splits too. Can you do the splits? I wouldn't like to try. Oh, she'll show you when she comes. Yeah, when's she coming? Oh, sometime. What's your name? My friends call me Bill. Oh, my name's Georgie. Do you come here often? Every now and again. I've got a mouth organ. You've got a mouth organ? No, I haven't. Oh, this is a beauty. I can play tunes on it. Real tunes? [Georgie] Yeah. Get away. Yes, I was gonna play one last Sunday for mummy but she didn't come. Well never mind, Georgie. Play something for me. Rightio. (harmonica music) Come along quickly, Georgie. You're late. Oh, I've got to go. Bye Bill. Bye Georgie. Will you two please stop fighting? Quiet now. Stand up straight, Tony. [Mrs. Daniels] We're ready now, Lynn. # Thank you for the world so sweet # Thank you for the food we eat # Thank you for the birds that sing # Thank you God for everything [Kids] Amen. Hey, guess what? They found my mum. I'm gonna see her next week. [Bill] Smashing, Annie, good, good. Hello Gloria. Oh, it's you. Last time you called. You're wasting your time, anyway. I'm an incurable optimist. You know that. Why can't you leave me alone? You promised to come and see Georgie last Sunday. No I didn't. How many more times do I have to tell you I want him to forget me? Yes but he doesn't want to forget you, Gloria. Tell him I'm still away on tour. [Ann] You can't keep that fiction up forever. Oh, for heavens sake, why can't you get him adopted? Because you're perfectly capable of taking care of him yourself. My dear girl, haven't you noticed? I'm a drunk, a confirmed drunk, an habitual slut. Court said I wasn't fit to keep the child and they were right. There's nothing wrong with you that couldn't be put right in one day. Stop drinking, Gloria and get yourself a job. A job, oh that's a rich one. Who'd employ me? Well you're a trained dancer, aren't you? Yeah, trained to fall flat on my face at every performance, matinees included. You know, Gloria, the theatre isn't the whole world. What's wrong with a job in a shop? Gloria, you haven't seen Georgie lately. He's so lively, so eager. There's so little for him to be eager about. Such a waste, Gloria. Well you do something about it, I can't. I think you can. I wouldn't last a week. It's worth a try. He's so proud of you, Gloria. You've got to give him something to be proud of. Try, Gloria. Oh leave me alone. Damn you, leave me alone. (sobbing) I'll make some coffee. You talk as thought it's easy. Well, it's not, I've tried. You know I've tried. I wish I'd left him in Australia, he'd have forgotten me then. He'll never forget you, Gloria. Do you know what he said to me the other day? He said, "I've got the prettiest mum in the world, "especially when she's got that stuff on her face." Alright, you win. I'll stop drinking. I'll make a home for Georgie. He'll be proud of me, you'll see. That's a girl. I'll make some coffee. (melancholy music) Later this evening, governor. Hello. Oh, hello. What are you doing here? I was just passing. How, well, can we sell you a television set? I got no time to look at television. Oh, you should buy this one then. It doesn't work. Quite a place you've got here, Bill. Yeah, we're being shut down soon. They're gonna build a block of offices here. Oh, I'm sorry. What you gonna do, Bill? I have to find somewhere else, won't I, otherwise I'll have to turn it up. Anyway, it's nice to see you. Sit down. How's business? Found many good children lately? Oh, as a matter of fact, business is rather good. I've just seen Georgie's mother. She's promised to pull herself together and try and get a job in a show. I knew I could do it and I have. Isn't that good? Well, I don't know. I don't know enough about it. Well you know Georgie. It's a crime he should be in a place like that. That applies to all of them, doesn't it? Well, yes, of course but in Georgie's case it's so unnecessary. He could have a good home and he's going to have it. That's the next move. What is it? Don't you ever get scared? [Ann] Scared, what of? No you don't do you? You're sure of yourself. You know exactly how to run your life and everybody else's. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. It's alright. I suppose I am a bit of a know all, aren't I? And now you're being modest. What about me buying you some lunch? Nope, I've already had it out of a bag. Blimey, you work like a horse and you eat like one. Don't you ever think of anything else except those kids? I don't have any time to. Well I do. You know I've been thinking, why don't we take them out one weekend in my car for a picnic? Bill, are you doing this just for the children? Well they'd get a picnic out of it, wouldn't they? Alright, it's a deal. I could squeeze seven of them in provided none of them get hiccups. (happy music) (kids screaming) Uncle Bill, Alec has to go. Oh, well ask him to hang on. We're nearly there now. Never mind, it's too late. (kids yelling) Well done, Barbie. Grab Bill. Everybody up, no more. The old gentleman's gonna have a rest. Can I muck about with the car now, Bill? Yeah, clean the plugs, Don. It sounded like plywood magma when we were coming down. May we go and pick some flowers? Yes darling, of course you can. Who we gonna give 'em too? We could give 'em to mum. Yeah, go on kids. You go and pick a whopping great bunch of flowers for the top of me grand piano. Bill, seen the papers today? What do you mean about Barbie's father being convicted? Yeah. Just make sure there aren't any papers in the home for Barbie to see. Think they'll hang him? Yes. I think they will. (harmonica music) That's a pretty tune, Georgie. I know, I made it up for Bill. You like Bill, don't you? Yeah, he's my friend. He's not going away, is he? No, of course not. Oh, that's good. I don't like it when people go away. I'm gonna ask mum if she's gonna take me on a picnic on Sunday. Oh, that's a good idea. You think she'll come? I'm sure she will, Georgie. Oh, that's good. I'll make a tune up for her too. (harmonica music) Oh dear, oh dear, I'm worn out. Can you feel your wings starting yet? Do you think they're enjoying themselves? Well of course they are. Are you? Yeah, I'd like to do it again sometime on our own. No go? It's not that Bill. It's just I can't seem to figure you out. I mean the kids all adore you and yet, you're always pretending to me that you're just not interested in them. Oh blimey, here comes the case book again. Well, why not? Probably do you a lot of good. Now, Bill Lowther. William David Lowther. Electrician. Electrical engineer. Pleasant disposition. Oh very pleasant, very well mannered, very handsome. Confirmed bachelor. Widower. Widower Bill? Would it help you to tell me about it? I don't suppose so. You're interested in live kids aren't you, not dead ones. Oh Bill, I'm sorry. When did it happen? You remember the big rail crash outside West Brom about seven years ago? Well him and his mother were going on holiday and she got it too. Oh, that's terrible. Was a lovely kid. Always laughing but he was sensible with it. Four years old and he could hand me any tool I asked for. I used to call him my mate. Must've been a very happy little boy. Yeah, he was. I can only remember him crying once. It was at the station. The train started to move and he rushed to the window and then his face sort of crumpled and he started crying, just as if he knew he'd never see me again. I know what you're thinking. Well I can't. I know I'll never see him again and I can't forget him. Now I think we better close the case book, don't you? It's raining. (thunder claps) Georgie, come on, kids, hurry, you'll get soaked. Hurry up, Barbie, get in the house, that's it. Never mind, Uncle Bill, we got smashing flowers. Oh they're lovely, aren't they? Are they as good as you get florists? Yeah, they're wonderful. There you are, madam, for you. Thank you, Bill. What are we gonna do if it doesn't stop raining? [Bill] I don't know, Georgie. Do you know any good stories, Uncle Bill? I know the one about the old lady from Glaston. Bill. Oh, you know that one, do you? Come here, I'll tell you a smashing fairy story, shall I? Once upon a time, many years ago, there lived a beautiful princess and she lived in a great big castle with her partner and all day long she loved to sing. But her father, he was a very, very mean man. He didn't like her singing so he locked her right in the top of the castle all by herself. And even though she was locked right in the top of this castle, she still went on singing and then one day, a gallant knight rode past on his horse and he heard this beautiful voice and he said, "Whoever possesses that lovely voice "is the girl I'm going to marry." And he thought to himself, "How can I let her know "that I've heard her singing?" So being a very gallant knight, he pulled out his sword and he cut one of his ears off. And then he put it into a silver box and he sent it to the princess. And when the princess opened the box, she said, "Blimey, what's this ear?" (kids laughing) Go on, go on Uncle Bill, go on. No, tell me about them getting married. They don't get married. Would you marry a fellow with one ear? Did you like that? Not much. Any more from you and you'll have to go out in the rain. Uncle Bill, why did it have to rain? Why'd it have to rain? Well, I know a song about that. It goes # If you didn't have rain # Then you couldn't have flowers # You couldn't have flowers # If you didn't have showers # Nowhere to swim # There'd be no babbling brook # There'd be no fish to catch # On the end of the hook # You couldn't wash your hands and face # You'd be as black as mortar # All day you'd face the barren waste # Looking for cool water # So you gotta have rain every now and then # To make the whole world shine # Then every day will turn out fine # Oh if you didn't have rain # Then you couldn't have Fish and chips. # If you didn't have rain # Then you couldn't have A drink of water. # If you didn't have rain # Then you couldn't have A swim. # No, you couldn't have I don't know. # If you didn't have rain # You'd be so awful dirty # You'd be as black as coal # If Mrs. Daniels saw you she'd say Upon my soul. # So you got to have rain every now and then # To make the whole world shine # Then every day will turn out fine Come on, sing it with me. # Oh, if you didn't have rain # Then you couldn't have flowers # You couldn't have flowers # If you didn't have showers. # Nowhere to swim # There'd be no babbling brook # There'd be no fish to catch # On the end of a hook # If you couldn't wash your hands and face # You'd be as black as molten # All day you'd face the barren waste # Looking for cool water # So you got to have rain every now and then # To make the whole world shine # Then every day will turn out fine (laughing) Shh, listen, quiet, it stopped raining. (laughing) Thanks, Bill. Alright, everybody out. Be careful, Georgie. [Ann] Good night, Don. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Marilyn. See you soon. Bye bye, Georgie. - Goodnight, Barbie. - Bye. Good night. Well if they don't sleep tonight, they never will. No. Do you know, I've really enjoyed today. I enjoyed being with the kids. Did you, Bill? I enjoyed being with you, too. Thank you. Do you know, I was thinking, if I phoned you tomorrow night and asked you to come out to dinner by yourself. Yes? What would you say? No. No, why not? Well, I haven't got a telephone. (laughs) You're learning, you are. Well, if I ask you know, what would you say? Yes, Bill, I'd love to. Alright, well I won't bother to phone then. Hello Don. You got her. Blimey, where is she? Downstairs. I can't. Are me trousers alright? I had 'em under the mattress last night. How do I look? You look a real top, Don. It's a great day, isn't it? Yeah. I know you talked to her miss. I'll never forget that. You go on down, Don. Ain't you coming? Yes, in a minute. (melancholy music) Hello, mum. [Mrs. Farrer] It ain't Don, is it? Yeah, course it is. Oh Don, I never thought you'd be so big. Well, I never thought you'd be so small. Must've shrunk mom. Oh, but you ain't changed a bit. Would've known you anywhere. Would you, Don? To think that you've been living here all this time, such a lovely place. Yeah, well let's get out of it, shall we? So big, lovely carpets and everything. Well Mrs. Farrer, how do you think he looks? [Mrs. Farrer] Oh Miss. Ah, so you've met. Well, isn't this a wonderful moment? I suppose we'll all have a nice cup of tea in my sanctum. No, well I've got it all planned. I'm taking mom out. Yes, of course, you must. A much nicer idea. Don't you agree, Mrs. Daniels? Well, yes, if they prefer to. Well perhaps... Yeah, well come on mom. And to think I was afraid to come. I merely didn't, you know? Yeah, you hadn't a chance. Not once Mrs. Failie had her hooks into you. She's master. (melancholy music) There you are, fish and chips. Jelly for after. Fish and chips and jelly. Don, you can't afford all that. Here. No, no, no, now, I've been saving up for this. Don't be daft, mom, people'll look. I'm so ashamed, Don. I've been such a bad mother to you. Mum, it weren't your fault. I will never to have gone off and left you like that. I can't think what come over me. I've never had any peace of mind since, never. Can you forgive me, dear? Don't talk silly, mom. Come on, eat your fish, it'll be cold. Miss Fairlie said you was working nights. That's right dear. And what, you sleep all day then? Oh no. I've got to get Mr. Hodges his tea. Who's Mr. Hodges, mom? He's my lodger, Don. I'm sorry, Donnie. Just sort of happened, see. I don't know. I don't seem to be able to manage on me own. Well, you won't need him much longer. I'll be starting work right after Easter. Then I can come and live with you. This bloke'll have to go. Well, I don't know so much about that. Mr. Hodges helps me with the rent, see. I'll help you with the rent. What's he do, this Hodges? He works for the council in the sanitary. What do you mean, shovels? No, he's a street cleaner. Well there's nothing to that, is there? What sort of a bloke is he? Oh, he's alright, I suppose. You ain't scared of him, are you? He don't knock you about? Oh no. Well, not often. Blimey, you do pick 'em, don't you? I'm sorry, Donnie. I never been no good to you. (crying) No, no, don't start that again. We're together, that's all that matters. Come on, eat your fish, it'll be cold. Yes dear. Don't worry, I'll sort things out, right after Easter, you'll see. Alright dear. Now let's go, you're under arrest. You coppers want me? Well come up and get me then. Ah, you're all scared now, ain't ya, eh? Get down off of there. What if Daniels see? It's a real 'un, isn't it? So what? You tell Daniels and I'll murder you. Where'd you get it? Off my brother. You're only jealous, that's what's wrong with ya. Well a gun won't fight, don't be daft. Well it would fight if it had bullets in it. Let's have a look at that. Go away. (tense music) (bell ringing) Mrs. Daniels, please be gentle with the child. Think of what she's been through. I have thought, Miss Fairlie and I am quite convinced she'd be better off somewhere else. Here she is. What's up? Barbie. Please, Miss Fairlie. Barbie, you were a dining room waiter yesterday, weren't you? And before supper, you came in here to collect my tray? Course I did, that's me job. You saw my handbag lying on the desk and you took my wallet from it. That's a lie, I never did. Now come along, own up. We know you took the money. I never, I never did. Miss? It's alright, Barbie. Who said I did? We do. Well, I didn't and you ain't got no proof. What about this then? I found that in your raincoat pocket half an hour ago. Now come along, own up. No one else had any reason to come in here. I tell you, I never took your money. That's a lie, child, a wicked lie. If my mum was here, she wouldn't let you say that, not if she was here, she wouldn't. (sobbing) It's alright, Barbie darling. [Mrs. Daniels] Miss Fairlie. Look Barbie, come along and wait for me outside. I never took their money. I know you didn't, Barbie, darling. Mrs. Daniels, I can't believe that Barbie stole that money. Miss Fairlie, you're very young. We've had years of experience of this sort of thing. You distrusted Barbie ever since she came here. That's not true. She's a dangerous influence. I've always said that. And here's the proof of it. Proof? Could have been planted in her raincoat. [Mrs. Daniels] Planted by who, Miss Fairlie? I don't know, Mrs. Daniels and I'm not going to make wild guesses. (melancholy music) Barbie darling, can I have a little talk with you? [Barbie] Wait for me outside, love. [Alec] Alright, Barbie. Barbie, would you like to go away for a little while? I ain't going nowhere, miss, not without Tony and Alec. Now Barbie. [Barbie] We've got to be together. They can't do without me. It's alright, darling. I know they'd have gone places. I won't go, I won't. Now listen, Barbie, you're not going anywhere, not because of this anyway. But you would like a holiday, wouldn't you? What are you getting at? Barbie, you trust me, don't you? I don't trust no one. You're trying to get rid of me just like those two. No Barbie, honestly. It's just for a fortnight with a kind lady who'll take care of you. It'll be fun. Maybe. I'll believe it when it happens. Good girl. Hello, how's the baby? [Female] Fine, thank you. Harry, come and light a cigarette for Miss Fairlie. That's it. Mmm... Miss, I'll blow. Thank you, Harry. Sorry to be in the way, ma. Oh, that's alright. You know me, always be around. Well, what's it all about dear, them blooming accounts? Oh, don't you worry about them. No brain for figures, that's my trouble. Still if I pay me way and the kids are happy, I don't see what they've got to worry about. You leave the committee to me ma. You're still one of the best foster mothers we have. How are they getting on round at Rattler? Oh, same as usual, you know, overcrowded. I've had to put the Taylor children in there. Oh Lord, Rattler's not right for them, is it? Oh poor little knights. If every anyone wanted a bit of kissing and cuddling, they do. Yes but ma, how am I gonna give it to them? [Female] Well, I'd take them like a shot, you know that dear. Yes, I know, mom but the committee would never agree to it. Oh them. You could put it across them. You know, ma, the trouble with you is that your heart is bigger than your house. Oh go on, will ya? I'll tell you what, why not let them come here for the holidays and then see how it works out. Oh ma, would you really? They'd love it. Well, we can't see kids unhappy, can you? Keep your chin up, chin up, that's it. Try to see what I'm gonna do next. That's it, good boy. Use your left, your left. Oh sorry. Don't apologise. Come on, keep going. Now block this one. That's it, good. Keep punching, Don. Keep that chin up all the time. Watch me, that's right. What are you doing? Hello miss. Hello. What on earth's going on here? Well, he's learning me to fight. I'm teaching him to box, just a spot of self defence, that's all. Do you know he was a commander during the war, miss? Were you Bill? Yeah, didn't you know? That's why it went on so long. (laughing) Yeah, guess what, miss? Bill's taking me on as an apprentice. No, that's wonderful. Go on, I'll bet you fixed it. Well, four hours tomorrow then Bill? Alright, Don. [Don] Ta da for now. Why this sudden interest in boxing Bill? He just wants to stand up for himself. I guess Hodge's want lodges, I should think. But Bill, he's only a boy. I must have a talk with this Hodges. If you do, Don'll never forgive you. Now, let him sort this out for himself. Don't you interfere. He won't spoil your run of luck. Luck? You do take some pretty long chances, don't you? I mean, Georgie for instance. Georgie? Oh, he's going to be alright. Is he? Supposing she does have him back. How do you know she won't get fed up with him? She won't get fed up with him. Gloria's learned her lesson. Look, Bill, I know you're very fond of Georgie but... I just don't want to see him get hurt, that's all. Well he won't get hurt. Oh Bill, you've got to trust people. That depends on the people. You see you take it for granted everybody's like you. Well, they're not. Most people are weak. You can push 'em so far and then they crack. And that's when other people get hurt. Nobody's going to get hurt. I must go. Isn't that typical? You've had all your say about the kids. As soon as I want to tell you my good news, you've got an urgent date somewhere. I'm sorry, Bill. What's your good news? Well, you know those new shops around in King Street? [Ann] Yes. I move in on the first of the month. Bill, that's wonderful. Yeah, there's a flat above it, you know. It's got two bedrooms and a kitchenette and a bathroom. It's very nice. It's wonderful for a married couple. It's too big for a single fella but well for a married couple, it's wonderful. Bill, you must let it. Don't you know any married couples who want a flat? No, I don't. Well there must be thousands of them. I mean, hmmm, I can't think of any either. It's a pity to let it go, isn't it? Mmhmm, especially with this shortage and everything. I wonder... Should we take the flat? Bill, look, I don't want to complicate my life just at this moment. Give me a little more time, will you? There's no rush. Any time this evening will do. You want to go now, Don dear? Hodges might be back early. I'm just finished, mum. He won't like it, you know? Look mom, him and me both can't live here. There ain't room. But you ain't even left the place yet. I shall have in a week or two. I ain't going into no high school. Not now I've got you to look after. But Donnie, you can't look after me. You're only a kid. Well, I'll be old. Three quid a week Bill's gonna pay me. So you won't need Hodges, will you? But what if he won't go? Well, he'll have to go. He hasn't got any rights. Are you sure this place is in your name? Oh yes, 'cause I had it see before I took up with him. Right, that settles it then, doesn't it? [Mrs. Farrer] But he won't take no notice, Don, he won't really. Well, he'll have to when he gets my letter. What'd you say to him dear? You have been polite, haven't you? Listen now, "To Mr. Hodges: "Dear sir, "This is to give you notice "on behalf of my mother, Mrs. M. Farrer and self," that's me, see. "As I wish to live with her "as is only right and natural. "Kindly vacate your room," that means get out of it, "by next Friday and oblige. "Yours truly, D. Farrer." That's that. It's lovely dear. I don't know how you thought of it. I suppose I better be off now. Come see me out? Oh, thank you dear. I'll see you next Sunday then and look after you. Alright, Don. Don't worry, it'll be alright. Goodbye, dear. Bye bye. Don. (happy music) [Don] Good day mam. How do you like the transformation act? It's wonderful, well done. Oh Gloria, Georgie was awfully upset that you didn't come to see him last week. I know, darling, so was I but honestly, I was actually dead. That first week of rehearsal just slayed me. Well you will come on Saturday, won't you? This Saturday? Gloria, you promised. Darling, of course I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Gloria, I want you to tell him yourself that he's going to come home here with you for good. You know, it'll be the most wonderful moment of his life. Gloria, what will you do? Will you put a divan bed in here for him? Yes, I expect so. Gloria, you won't let me down, will you? Darling, haven't you noticed, look at me. I haven't had a drink or a smoke for a week. Good. Well, I must go now. Give him my love, won't you? I always do. Hello, Jillian, it's Gloria May here. Would you give Roger a message for me, please? Yes, tell him I'm awfully sorry but I can't get into rehearsal tomorrow. No, I'm not awfully well. Yes, that's right. Thanks very much. Bye. (sobbing) Hello Georgie. What are you up to? My mum's gonna come today. She's gonna take me out. Oh, it's fine. Yeah, we're going on a picnic. You're a bit early, aren't you, Georgie, it's not nine o'clock yet. Oh, I don't care. As long as she comes. Yeah well, yeah well, be a good boy, won't you? You seen Don around? No. Well have a good time, won't you? [Georgie] You bet. Oh, it's a good thing I came. I didn't know you were bringing your own furniture. Well, I made it in woodwork. I'll take the case Mr. Chip and Dale. Oh, are you off already? Just a minute, Sally, are the Taylor children in there? Well, Alec and Tony are. Barbie's in the garden. Oh... Do you want her? No, I don't. Any minute now, isn't it? What? Nine o'clock the big drop. Don. Does Barbie know her father's being... No, of course not. She does, you know? How did she find out? Well, how do you think? Derek got it from his brother. Derek would never, that would be a wicked thing to do. You don't know nothing about kids, do you? You are in a hurry to leave us. Oh yes, well I told mom I'd be home early. He's taking me. Oh, how nice. Well, don't forget us all together, will you Don? We've done our best for you here. You know that, don't you? Oh yes, yes. Aren't you going to say goodbye to the others? No, I don't want no fuss. Oh well, never mind. You'll come back and see us sometimes? Oh yeah, sure. You must always think of this as your second home, you know? Well bye bye for now. Goodbye, Don. Be a good boy. Bye Don. Bye bye. Well come on Bill. Yes, well, very good sir. (melancholy music) Won't be a minute, Don. Are you going away for good? Yeah. I'm going away soon. I'm gonna go and live with my mum. Good for you, kid. (sobbing) (bell tolling) Shhh. (melancholy music) (car zooming past) (melancholy music) Now come along now, Georgie. You can't go without your dinner. Perhaps mommy will come this afternoon. But she said she was gonna come this morning. Yes, well, I've phoned Miss Fairlie and she's going round to find out what's happened. I bet it's just a mistake. It isn't a mistake. She said she was coming just after breakfast. Yes well, come along now, there's a good boy. Come and have some dinner. I think she's out. What with her curtains drawn? I'll go and see. I'll come with you. Now Bill. Now come on, I want to meet her. (upbeat music) (doorbell ringing) Do you think she's been out all night? What with the radio still playing? (doorbell ringing) (upbeat music) That's funny. You wait here. # She's hard and she's not refined # But she's still soft and brown and she's mine, all mine # Oh I love my sugar # Love her de da do # If you knew my sugar # You would love her too. Bill? Bill? What's that? It was a bottle of sleeping tablets. Don't go in there, it's too late. I better phone the police. Georgie. Take the car. Come along now, Georgie. You can't stand about here all day. Come into the playroom. We're going to have a nice new game. She isn't coming, is she? You promised she'd come today. [Ann] Yes, I know I did dear but mommy can't come. Why not? She hasn't gone away again, has she? Yes, Georgie, I'm afraid she has. But you said she wouldn't go away anymore. You promised. Yes, I know I did dear but I'm afraid it isn't her fault. She had to go. She isn't coming now, is she? She'll never come anymore, she'll never come. Georgie. Oh you shouldn't have promised. Leave me alone. Well what did you tell him? Just that his mother had gone away. What happened with the police? Nothing much, they weren't very interested. They knew her record. Was Georgie very upset? He looked at me as if I'd hit him. Oh, Bill, I didn't mean to hurt him. I wanted to help him, her too. You think I should've know, don't you? That I pushed Gloria too far? Forget it, let's not talk about it. [Ann] Well, maybe you were right? If only I'd listened to you. Why should you listen to me? I'm just a working electrician. You're a highly trained social worker. But to me, kids are human beings. To you, they're just puppets, puppets to be used in a game, a game you enjoy as long as you win. I'll go and see Rachel first thing in the morning. I'm obviously not suited to this kind of job. I'll hand in my resignation. You can't do that. What about the other kids? What about Georgie himself? What's gonna happen to him? [Ann] I can't go on. I can't, not now. Well, it's all over now, the woman's dead. It's forgotten, it's finished. [Ann] Not for me, it isn't. Oh you, you, you, you, can't you think of anybody else but yourself? If you were so sure I was wrong, why didn't you stop me? You could've stopped me. Why didn't you? Dear God, you've been forgetting us since we came to this rotten dump and we need your help. How 'bout this for an idea? Me, Tony and Alec are going to run away and it's up to you to keep Mrs. Daniels asleep. Goodbye, God. I'll speak to you tomorrow. Oh, and another thing, Tony and Alec send their love too. Wake up, wake up, Tony. Come on love, wake up. Wake up, love. That's a good boy. Hey, wake up. That's a good boy. What in the heck do you think you're doing? [Barbie] Shhh. What are you all dressed for? Are you running away? Where are you going? Just away from here. Why? They're trying to get rid of me. They're trying to put me in a reform place. You taking Tony? Yeah, I'm taking both of them. Wake up, Alec. I'm so tired. Wake up. I'm too tired. I'm coming, too. Well, I don't want to stay here anymore, not now. Besides, you got to have someone to look after you. Where you going? Somewhere without people. We can camp out in the wood. There's wild animals out there in the wood, ain't there? I got an idea. That's Derek's gun. I know but we'll need it. Money. I wonder where he got it. (coughing) That's Derek's gun, ain't it? What you gonna do with it? You shut up. Why are you dressed? Never you mind. You get dressed and get them dressed. I'll fix the floorboard up, Barbie. Come outside. What for? I want to tell you something. Alright. Get moving. Come on, we've got to get you dressed. [Alec] I'm too tired. You got it right, ain't you? And don't you do nothing till just before you go to school, see? And you'd better go to bed now. And if you open your mouth to that Derek kid, I'll come back and I'll flog you. I won't say nothing, Barbie. You better not. I wish I was coming with you. Well you've got a job to do here. See, we're depending on you. You can go up to bed now. Where we going, Barbie? Shhh. [Alec] I'm too tired for this. Are we going to see mum? I want to go back to bed. At anytime during the night, I suppose. What? No, of course not, inspector. This isn't a prison. Very well. Do we lock them in? The Taylor girl should have been. I might've known she'd abscond. Oh how can you be so stupid? Stupid! The girl proves her guilt by running away. She ran away because she was afraid of you and what you might do to her. [Mr. Daniels] You and your favourites! (knocking on door) Come in. Go away Tim, we're busy. I've got something to show you. Not now, Tim. But Barbie said I've got to show you. Barbie did? Leave this to us please. Now Tim, what did Barbie tell you to show us? She said to say she kept one for a lend. I knew it. She found them. Huh, she expects us to believe that? I believe it. She did find them, miss, I saw her. Where Tim? Upstairs. I'll show you, shall I? Yes please, Tim. This is ridiculous. Alright, come on now. That's it, steady, that's it and you. Go get lost now, will ya? Okay, grandad. This'll be a mighty place for the hideout. I know, I came here last year with the Sunday school picnic. We'll have to get lots and lots of wood for the camp. We won't do that today. We'll do that tomorrow. Alright, we'll play today. Have we got all the food? Two cakes each. Alright, well let's go and explore, heh, come on. (kids playing) (happy music) Georgie, I fell over. Come on, let's go. Isn't this smashing? Gee, where are we gonna build our camp, Barbie? Further on, much further. How far, five miles? No, 10 miles. You don't want any grown-ups to find us, do you? Oh, we should've brought a chopper. What for? I saw in the pictures where all the trees there were so thick they had to chop 'em all down to make space for the camp. Oh, we'll just have to find some space. I'll go and find some now. Come on. Okay, don't get yourself lost. [Georgie] Will. Come on, Alec, hurry up. [Tony] I'm hungry, Barbie. Well, you'll just have to stay hungry. We ain't got much food. What time we going home? We're not going back. We're staying here. What, all the time? Yeah, that's unless they find us. And they ain't gonna find us. Blimey, what's this? It's his Sunday pull over. It's a fair item. It's a fair stinker. Oh Don, I wish you wouldn't. I just won't like it, you know? Well, that's too bad. I gave him fair warning. He should've packed himself. But he won't go, Don, so what's the good? He'll go. You just leave him to me. Don, I wish you wouldn't. He'll go for you, I know he will. He just better try. Come on, out of the way mom. Look mom, don't worry. We got a smashing place here. We're gonna be alright. Don, please dear, won't you leave it? I know you mean well but... (door closing) It's him, it's Hodges. Oh Donnie. Tell him you're just going. It's Don, Joe. You know, my boy. So you're Don, are you? Well, you be a good boy and get off home, see? I'm sorry, Mr. Hodges but it's for you to go, not me. You got my letter. There ain't room here for both of us. I packed your case seeing as how you hadn't packed it yourself. Well you... No Joe, don't hit him. You'll get some more of that if you don't get out and stay out. Run Don, quick. [Don] Come on mom, you go inside. No, I don't want to. Don, please don't. You go inside now, please don't worry. [Mrs. Farrer] Don, Don... You'll pay for that. Don't hit him. (crying) (struggling) Don, Don, Donnie! (struggling) (sobbing) Don, he'll murder you, he will. Mom, mom! Mom, mom! Mom, you can come out. Oh! Oh Donnie, what you done? I knocked him out. You had enough, Hodges? Why you oughtta... You come up here, you hit me again and I'll get you gaoled. I've got the state behind me. My dad got three years out for hitting me. Ain't that right, mom? Yeah. And you'll get more 'cause he was my dad and you ain't. If I tell the police, more than likely, you'll get 10 years. Oh no, Don. (sobbing) I don't want no trouble with the police. Are you going then? Where's me case? Bye, Joey. (sobbing) You won't get no more trouble from him. You got me to look after you now. So that's the end of that, eh? Yes, Donnie, that's the end of that. Come on, mum, I'll make you a nice cup of tea, alright? You'll have to get more twigs than that. Can't you stop nagging just for a minute? Come on, Alec, it's time for you to go to bed. Good night. [Alec] Night, Barbie. Come on, it's way past your bedtime. Goodnight, Tony. Goodnight, Barbie. I'm hungry Barbie. Well you'll just have to stay hungry. What time we going home? Shut up and go to bed. Goodnight, love. I saw on the pictures once there were all these people, they were stranded on a desert island and there was bananas growing on the trees. You and your pictures. I want a banana, Barbie. Oh now look what you've done. I wish there was some shops around here. I'm sick of trees. Well you chose it. You said somewhere without people. But this is too much without people. (birds chirping) What was that? I don't know but if it comes any closer, I'll frighten it with me gun. Can we go home? Can we go home Barbie? We can't go home. We ain't got no home. Now shut up and go to bed. (birds chirping) Oh, it's only a bird. I wish we had some food to cook on the fire. We'll have to get some more grub tomorrow. But if we go shopping, the grown-ups'll see us. Well one can go. They won't notice one. Yeah, we'll have to get some more money somehow. Yeah, I've got it all planned. See we can do paper rounds and chopping wood, you know, things like that. Yeah and then we can live here always, no grown-ups, on our own here, Barbie. Yeah, that's if it don't rain. Oh, we'll build a house tomorrow, you know, out of old trees and stuff. I saw it on the pictures. Yeah, I know. I'm going to bed. I'll keep watch. Okay. I'm starving hungry. Steak pudding, that's what I like. With bread and drippy. Oh, give over. Alright Edwards, you've admitted you took the money. So I took the money. What are you gonna do about it? We'll deal with that later. Now what about the gun? You might as well tell us. We're bringing your brother in anyway. Don't you bring him here. If he finds out what I done last night, he'll kill me. What did you do last night? Come on, Edwards, it's no good holding anything back from us. It'll only be worse for you in the end if you do. [Derek] I didn't mean to do it. Ann, I got the news from Don. I came round right away. Thank you, Bill. Sorry about last night. That's alright. You were right, anyway. Everything went wrong last night, didn't it? Oh Bill, I'm so worried about those kids. Any news yet, Sergeant? Yes, good news. We know they went by Green Line to Finchem Woods. But don't you worry about it, Miss Fairlie, we've organised a full scale search for dawn tomorrow. We'll find 'em. Miss Fairlie, there's something you should know, Edwards has just confessed that last night before he went to bed, he put a live bullet in that gun. Do the kids know it's loaded? [Sergeant] He says not. Let's hope they don't start target practise before we find 'em. Right, now you all know what to do. (mumbles) Off you go. (yawning) Georgie! Barbie! Bang, bang, bang. Shut up, you'll frighten 'em all. I'll take that gun away from you in a minute. No you won't. Give me that gun. [Georgie] Come and get it. (kids fighting) Come on, Barbie, you'll win. You're not having it. It's my gun. You're not having it. Stop fiddling around, you baby. Give me the gun. Now you've gone and busted it. Give it here. There you are. - Georgie! - Barbie! What was that? Be quiet, Tony. They're coming after us. Come on, let's go! Barbie, Georgie! Georgie! We'll have to hide. They can't go any further. [Georgie] Let's hide over there, quick. [Barbie] Come on. What are we hiding for? Shhh. Look, cakes from Baker Street. That's where they got the bus. [Policeman] Alright, everyone, spread out. They're around here somewhere. Shout if you find anything. I'll go with the others. Georgie! Barbie! They're coming nearer. Georgie! Barbie! It's Bill. Yes it's Bill. Georgie! Georgie! (sneezes) He's seen us. You wait here and I'll go and scare him off with my gun. Okay. Hello Georgie. Don't you come no closer, mister or else I'll let you have it. Georgie, I'll show you a smashing trick with that gun. I'm warning you, mister. I'll fill you full of lead. Ah, Georgie, you wouldn't shoot your old partner down in cold blood, would ya? This is a pretty powerful gun and it hasn't missed nobody yet. Georgie, I'll show you a smashing trick with that gun. Hey you better hit the trail mister or you'll be biting the dust. Georgie, be careful now, that gun's loaded. Don't be silly. I'll show you. Georgie, no, no. (gun fires) Bill, Bill, I've killed you. Bill, you're dead, I didn't mean to do it. I didn't know the gun was loaded. You're my friend. You scared me. What do you think you did to me? Did I hit you? No, it was a bloody good try though, Georgie. Let me take that gun before there's any more accidents. I never want to see you playing with any guns anymore. Barbie, Barbie, darling, we've been so worried. We ran away. I know, darling, but it's alright now. No, it's not. Tony's got a cold. He needs his chest rubbed. Alright, sweetheart. Well, I'll see to it. (kids playing) Look at those two, put me down. If you two don't stop, I'll give you the biggest hiney you ever had. Come on, break it up. I said, break it up. I'll give you a hiney. Come on! You stay there, children. Aw, Mrs. Daniels, these are the Katlers. I believe you're expecting them. Oh yes. Now children, this nice kind lady is going to take care of you so now you be good. I'll be back tomorrow to see you. Where's Georgie? He's just coming. Come along now, children. I'm ready. Here's my case. Gee, isn't this exciting? Very exciting. You said goodbye to the others? No, come on. Oh, but you must, Georgie. No, I'll come back and say goodbye. Please, I want to go home. [Ann] You wait till you see the room. Bill's painted for you in our new flat. Madam. Thanks for the lift, Uncle Bill. Ooh, I nearly forgot. Oh, thank you. What's this? That's some smashing soap. It's a wedding present from me, Tony and Alec. Oh, thank you, Barbie, that's just what I wanted. You know something, Uncle Bill, I'm never gonna get married. Aren't you, Barbie? No, and what's more, I'm gonna see that my children don't get married either. (laughs) Taxi mam? Hello Barbie. There's nothing wrong with Mrs. Robbins, is there? No, Tony's torn through his pants, I come through his others. Oh, so you're enjoying your holiday? Smashing. We're staying there for good. [Ann] Did Mrs. Robbins tell you that? Not exactly, I told her. Come along, Ann, we're ready. [Ann] Oh, I get it, I'm supposed to drive. Well, I have had a busy day. Where to? Home please. Home, Mrs. Lowther. That's the way, Georgie, get the wife working. (melancholy music)
