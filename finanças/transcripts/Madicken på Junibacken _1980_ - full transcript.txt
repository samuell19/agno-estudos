Here comes Madicken. She's coming home from school. She lives at Unibakken Manor with her mother, Daddy, Sister Lisbeth and Alva. Unibakken is located on the outskirts of the city. On the way home, there's so much of all things interesting! - Uncle Nilsson, you scared me! - Well, a man's gotta have a little fun! I thought the brave young lady from Unibakken not so easy to scare, huh? - Look, what a beautiful angel. - I like this one better. No, this one's better. Although there's no arguing about taste. said the man who wore his shirt backwards. - Okay, kid, I got to go. - Where to? Business, business... Uncle Nilsson is almost always happy with life - except when he's out of sorts. But at the Nalivaika, he said, "feels the life in me." Uncle Nilsson is Abbe's father, Abbe is Madicken's best friend. - Madicken! Hi! - Hey! Tomorrow I'm coming to see you at Unibakken, clear the pipe! Great! - By the way, say hello to Alva. - I won't! By the way, say hi to your wife and kids! Madicken likes the chimney sweep, but she doesn't want to, for Alva to get in her head for nothing. Yeah, it's better with a wet bag not to show your face at home... She's going to see Abbe first. - Hey, Madicken! How's it going? - It's okay. How's school going? Did you learn all your lessons? - Can I hang it up to dry? - Go ahead! - Where did you get it wet? - In the river. - What for? - Well... And it wasn't even me who put her there. one boy tossed. - What kind of idiot is that? - His name is Rickard. He's in my class. - What a bastard! Why would he do that? - And he's a fool. He also spilled an inkwell. And wiped his hands on my dress. Look! Strange things... So you say his name is Rickard? Madicken, you know what? I think you're lying. And you're lying, too! All that ghost talk. - one lie! - No, it's not! - I haven't seen one! Well, you're not psychic. But I am. Psychic how? Only clairvoyants see ghosts, and regular people can't. - Really? - I'm telling you! Or maybe I'm a psychic, too. just haven't met any ghosts yet? - You want to come with me to the cemetery? - Do they live there? They're wandering around in droves! Isn't there someplace else where there's less of them? - Are you afraid? - No, but... Well, we could also look in the laundry room - There are Swedish ghosts there, too! - Really? - Absolutely! Not during the day, maybe, but at night... Does it have to be at night? What did you think! Midnight is the best time for them. At midnight, the Old Man comes... Oh, I forgot about the pretzels! - Who's the Old Man? - Quiet! It's a secret! If you promise not to blab, I'll tell you. - I promise. - Let's go. Get in! Well, the old man isn't someone other than my great-great-grandfather! A rich earl who lived a hundred years ago. So I'm a count myself, but it's a secret! Why is he wandering around the laundry room? When he filled all the banks with money, there's no more room, and then he buried it in the laundry room a huge chest of money! And then he died! Now it's wandering around! - So the money's still there? - Of course! What's his name? And his name was Count Abbe Nilsson the Black! Come with me! Maybe we can to see where he hid the money. I tried a couple of times myself, but it disappeared right away. I'm afraid my mother won't let me... You're a scarecrow! Are you gonna tell your mom?! Then you'd better forget about it altogether! Now you'll never know, if you really are a psychic. Yeah, that's... But I'm not gonna be able to hold out before midnight, I'll be asleep! It's not good... Although, maybe I'll be able to cheat my great-great-grandfather! - You know how? - Nope. I'll set my watch back three hours. and put them in the laundry room. He'll think it's twelve, and nine, in fact. - Great, huh? - That's great. - Are you coming or not? - All right, I'm coming. That's great! I can count on you! Nine o'clock, then! - Hey. - Hey. A guy asked me to tell you Hi, but I won't. - Who? - The chimney sweep. - Did he say hi to me? - I didn't say that. - Where's Mom? - In the living room. Adolphine, Adolphine, Dance the waltz with me... What the hell is that? Hi! Madicken, where did you get of this vulgarity? - Nilsson's, of course? - Nope. I don't like the fact that you you've been there so often. - Well, they're not. - Who taught you? - Rickard! - Who's that? He's in my class. He knows all kinds of songs and bad words. You shouldn't be with him... . What's that? Guess what! Hey, people, look out - I'm coming! Hello, Linus Ida and little Pims! - Nilsson, are you drunk again? - Yeah, why? It's none of my business, but you're gonna end up bad! There's a guy I know. - is laying it on the line, just like you. The doctor told him that if he if he doesn't stop drinking, he dies! Very interesting. I have a friend, too. Drinking too? No, he has one eye. blue, the other brown. One blue, one brown? How so? And he got a light in his eye when he's minding his own business. What's that supposed to mean? Think about it... Unas... I don't like the fact that Madicken has been in contact with the Nilsson's a lot. - Is that it? Why is that? - You know him... Yeah, well, there's that... But my kids need to know, that there are different people in the world... - Isn't it? - Yeah, well... Let's change the subject. - Play me something. - All right. Lisabeth, are you asleep? Madicken, you're a fool... - What, that's it? - No, I'm just gonna put my sweatshirt on. Well, now we'll find out, if you're really psychic. Did you change your watch? Yeah, and I set the alarm great-great-grandpa didn't oversleep. Let's go. Can I hold your hand? I can't see very well. Yes? This is weird. - So, do you want to see a ghost? - I don't know... Otherwise, you'll never know, whether you're psychic or not. - I want to see, but just for a second. - Then let's go. I'm not to blame if anything! - Turn on the flashlight! - You don't know ghosts. If you shine a light on them. are terribly angry and snarling. Count Abbe Nilsson Black, are you here? There he is! Over there by the wall! See? See that white shadow glowing over there? - No. - That's weird. Noble Count, where did you hide the money? Please, answer me! Always the big shot. I, too, am an earl, and they are mine by right. Be fair! Ugh! He's so ugly! You really don't see him? No. I guess I'm not psychic. I'll go. Wait, he's waving at me. Wants me to come over. - Yes, Grandpa, I'm coming. - Don't go! I have to. He wants to show me the money. Stay right there. Abbe! I want to go home! Abbe! Abbe! Quiet! Don't yell like that, you'll wake up the old Earl! - Alva! - Madicken... ?! - What are you doing here? - I saw a ghost! Come on, tell me everything. That's it. I'm gonna rip that Abbe's hair out! - A black count, too! - It's not his fault he's psychic! Wait till I get my hands on him. I'll be out of your hair in no time... Now go to sleep! - Good night! - Good night. Black Count! - Hey! - Hey. If I had known you were like this. psychic, we wouldn't go to the laundromat. - I'll never go there again! - Oh, come on! - Don't worry, he won't come again. - How do you know? I found his money. - Really?! - Yeah. But it's a secret - look, don't tell your Alva. All right! - Abbe, are you rich now? - If only... Turns out that Grandpa had hidden It's only two and a half. So little?! He lived a hundred years ago, didn't he? and back then it was a lot of money! - Here you go, for luck. - Thank you! It's "ghost money," but it can be used to buy everything, just like the regular ones. The galosha looks like a little boat-- which means she can swim... We should check it out... Only the boat has the speed turned out to be more than she thought. What are we gonna tell Mom now? It wasn't me, it was Rickard who threw it there! - He wanted to see if she would swim. - Ricard needs a spanking. - Who's Rickard? - Bully classmate. Show Daddy what he did with your textbook. - It's the queen! - Yes, it was a beautiful portrait. And yesterday he ate Madicken's eraser. - This can't be happening! - Yeah, I did. I ate it. That's what Madicken says. - Let's not talk about Ricard anymore. - Come on, I'm in a bad mood. Your move, Madicken. - Are you still the best student in the class? - Yeah, but Victor's catching up with me. - He can move his ears. - And he gets grades for that? Imagine you got a grade "Can't move his ears." - Can't Rickard move his ears either? - Leave me alone with your Ricard! Ricard needs a spanking! - You got rabbits? - I bought them! - 50 eres each. - They're so cute! I bought them for a divorce. Soon I'll have 30-40 pieces! - Have you named them yet? - Yeah, their names are Daddy and Mommy. This one's round - Mama. And that troublesome one over there is Pops. You should have given them real names, prettier ones. - Do they like it when you play? - They really love music. Their favorite is "Adolphine." Look, here comes the teacher! - Hello! - Good afternoon, Madicken. We're clearing the snow so that spring will come sooner. Yes? Well, then we won't have to wait long. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Spring work is in full swing. - Yes, it's so much fun to rake old leaves! - And how good the fire smells! Yeah, when the smoke is over the city, It's a sure sign that spring has sprung! - Why aren't you wearing galoshes? - Yeah, because Rick... - Rickard threw her into the river. - What a nasty boy! You must be having nothing but trouble with him! - Me? - That Rickard seems awfully naughty. But we don't have one in our class a boy - and never was. Well, well, young lady... Madicken! My heart, don't just sit there. - You'll catch cold and get sick. - That's good. - What good is that? - Then I'll die. - You can't live with that kind of shame. - You poor thing... - Where's Mom and Dad? - Let's go for a walk with Lisabeth. I guess they don't want to see me anymore... Here's some more nonsense! Nobody likes a liar. I'll tell you what, baby... . All people lie sometimes... Not Mom and Dad. Well, definitely not Dad. - And you lied, too? - Many times. But I'm done with it. You know, sometimes a person forgets that I told you before, that's how you get caught... - I will never lie again. - That's good. Let's go home. to drink chocolate and play cards! How kind you are! Alva, I liked Ricard. But he's gone and he's not coming back. I miss him. It's summer, and pleasure boats are sailing down the river. And among the passengers. old acquaintances are coming through. Madicken! Don't they have anything better to do going back and forth... - They're on a walk! - On a walk! In the middle of the working day! And we're gonna have a picnic, too, because that it's my mom's birthday. We congratulated her this morning. - Madicken, what do we do? - Take off your pants and run! - And dragging the cat by the tail! - Ha! I already did that. - You did what? - Dragging the cat by the tail If you've been yanking the kitten again. by the tail, I'll slap you! I didn't pull anything! I was just holding his tail, And he was pulling so hard that his tail almost came off. You know that God's angels weep, when the kids hurt the animals? Yes, and then it rains. And now he's gone! Look, Dad! - What's that? - Thanks for the ride, Mr. Editor! Good afternoon. - What is it, Junas? - A gift for my beloved wife! Yeah, you are! I didn't bring any firewood! Calm down, lily of my heart! Consider the stall full! Look! Help me, Younas. - What the hell is that thing? - Vacuum cleaner! - Expensive, I guess? - Yeah, but he's worth it! Now the Unibakken will be the most the cleanest house in the whole town! And before that, was it dirty?! - We're not cleaning up well, are we?! - No, but it'll be a lot easier now. I'll never touch it in my life. to that diabolical thing! - He must be growling and stinking! - It's nothing like that! Then I'm leaving, since you don't need me anymore. Dear Linus Ida, how could we be without you! I'm going to see the Burgomaster tomorrow. They don't have any hell machines! Every year on my mom's birthday. the whole family goes on a picnic to Petrus Karlsson's meadow near the Apelküllen estate. Dad thinks it's it's going to be an unforgettable day. That's for sure... . Ugh! Away! Shoo! Dad, run! - Climb the tree! - Run! - Younas, be careful! - Get off! Younas, look out! Up a tree! To the tree, I said! Hurry up! - Scared? - You bet! You promised me I'd never forget this day... I certainly won't forget now, how they ran after you! - I'm hungry! Get out! - And don't dream... We'll be here until the fall, until the owner comes for them. I don't want to be here all summer! I don't mind... If only we had food... - Oh, come on! - It's a piece of cake. Well, Lisabeth and I are gonna eat. - How did you do that? - That's not fair! - I have to starve myself on my birthday? - And you, come here. Madicken! Throw us a couple of sandwiches? All right! Here you go. - Just be more accurate! - Catch! - Please. - Thank you. Veal and cucumber. Alva knows her stuff! And I've got ham! - Throw a beer too? - No, it's dangerous. - But my throat is dry. - Out of the question! - Why do you need a rope? - You'll see. Here you go! Dad, get your beer! - Wow! - That's clever! Thank you, Madicken! Cheers! Cheers, Kaisa! Live happily ever after! Our Kaisa, congratulations, A gentle, gentle hug, We wish her a long life, And a big kiss! Thank you, my lovelies! - The weather seems to be deteriorating. - Yeah, it does. - I want to go home! - And I love thunderstorms - they're fun! I don't! Daddy, chase the bulls away! Go away! Ew! Shoo! - I'm gonna go downstairs and try... . - No, don't do that. I've had enough bullfighting. We'll just sit here till we get some moss on us. I want to go home! Go away, you bastards! - Oh, look, Lisabeth chased them away. - It's not her, it's the gadflies. They were chased by a pack of gadflies. Lisabeth, what a clever girl you are! Oh, it's raining! Yes, it's a day they won't soon forget... Days like this are often happened in Unibakken. Sometimes Lisabeth would provide the entertainment. Madicken, I have a pea in my nose, and there's no way she's coming out! Why did you put it in there? - Well, I was wondering if it would fit or not. - You're always sticking things where they don't belong! - So how do I get it out? - Hold on, I'll give it a shot. - Where is she? - There! - Ow, it hurts! - No, I can't get it out. It will probably stay there and sprout! - No! - Yes! And you'll have sprouts sticking out of your nose! And then the peas will grow! - Where's Mom? - Lying down and resting. She's got to get her out! Mom! Sit tight! - No, I can't get it out. - Am I just gonna stay with her? Oh, my God... (sighs) Madicken, take Lisabeth to Dr. Berglund-- he'll get it out. - Are you sure it'll pull out? - Yes, yes, that's right! - I'll call him. - Let's hurry up! - What if it does sprout? - Then we'll pin it to the dress. - Nothing in sight yet. - Yeah, I don't think so. This is where Linus Ida lives. - Can we come in for a minute? - Come on. "I'll be back soon. " - She's not home. - Is the door locked? No. Let's go in and wait. - Terribly beautiful pictures! - Right! What does it say? "Do you want to drown in a sea of vodka too?" - You know what? - What? If I fall into a sea of vodka, I'll swim fast! You know I can swim, right? And if you get caught Vulcan, what are you gonna do? - I'll run! - And if you don't?! Don't, come on! - It's Ruth. - No, it's Esther. - This is Ruth, and this is Esther. - No! Poor Linus Ida - her daughters live in Chicago. - No, they're in America. - And Chicago is right in America. Okay. But it's still Esther! Oh, I wish I could play. like Linus Ida. Snotlout. You're a snot! Lousy! I'm gonna punch you in the face! Madicken! - Serves you right! - Mia! - What? - She pushed me and I fell. You're gonna get it! - Hold on, Mia! - Hold on, Madicken! - You give up? - No way, you goddamn brat! Oh, my God... Did you get in a fight? - Does it show? - Yeah. I thought that today Lisabeth is my patient. That's what Mom said, anyway. - Did mom call? - Yeah, only three times. She wondered if you were even alive. Well, let's go see. Sit down. So... - Who did you fight with? - With Mia. - Who's that? - Classmate. - Strong? - So-so. - And who won? - Я. Madicken, you fool! - You look like a snail with white horns. - Yeah? - See for yourself. - It does look like it. Well, now it's your turn, Lisabeth. Sit down. Let's see... - Won't it hurt? - No, don't be afraid. Which nostril did you put the pea in? - This one. - Yeah. I don't see any pea. And she jumped out when I fought Mattis. What a lovely evening... . - Are the kids asleep? - Yes, of course. All right, time for bed. Good night. - Madicken, can I lie on your arm? - Come on. Just don't get on my nose. - Mattis needs to be blown. - And Mia. Exactly. - Is Mia that stupid at school, too? - Yes, although Rickard... - Although I do slap her sometimes. - She's just a fool! But I still don't want to, so she can go to hell... Why is she going to hell? She's been saying hell! Linus Ida says that they're going to hell for it. We have to ask God, for him to forgive Mia. - Otherwise she won't ask for it. - Yeah, I don't think... Dear God, forgive me. Mia at least this time. She didn't mean to... And anyway, she said not to "devil's spawn," but "black." Yeah, I guess. And then she won't go to hell! Quiet! It's Abbe playing! Madicken's coming home from school - how quickly! Where is she going in such a hurry? Something special must have happened... Maybe there's more waiting for her one unforgettable day? - Hey, Lisabeth! - Hey. - Is mom home? - Yeah. What's your hurry? - Mom, guess where I'm going tomorrow? - Isn't that the school? - No, you're not! I'm going on a field trip! - That's great! Where to? First we'll take the train, then we'll go on foot, and then we'll have a picnic on the hill! - I want to wear my sailor suit! - Then we have to pet him! And I'll have sandwiches! Cheers! - I want a tour, too. - Baby, you're not in school yet. And here I am, sneaking around! I want to sit on the hill and eat sandwiches! You already went to my birthday picnic. But it's a school picnic. - another thing! - You know... - I want to sit on the hill, too! You know what? We can arrange a picnic with you two. Yeah, and we'll sit on the hill! Madicken, what a clever girl you are! Yes, you can have a picnic at the homestead, in some cozy corner somewhere. Yes, on a beautiful hill! Madicken, come quickly! I have to go. Alva, make them sandwiches, will you? - Lots and lots! - A whole bunch! - Keep an eye on them, okay? - With one eye. And with the other, I'll do the ironing! - Where are you going? I need to know. - We'll be here by the house. - We just... - Quiet! - We'll be here. - Then I can iron in peace. - In both eyes! - Yeah. Take it from the other end. You ready? Get in! Madicken, I don't want to go on the roof. Don't whine! There won't be any picnic. Come on, it's no big deal! Easy for you to say! - Madicken, you fool! - See, you did it. Yeah, I'm good at climbing! - Look, you can see Nilsson's kitchen from here! - I told you we'd have a good view. - There's Abbe baking his pretzels - He bakes them all the time. - There's Uncle Nilsson. - Yes, and already drunk. - He's always like that. - No, just sometimes. Abbe! It's time to eat. - Look! With sausage and butter. - And eggs and meatballs. - I'll take a meatball. - Me, too. Now we have to admire the views. That's what they always do at a school field trip. There's a fisherman over there... - Oh, what a lovely view she must have from up there. - Who? - That bird over there! - Yeah. - I wish I could fly... - People can't fly. - They can, by plane. Abbe told me. - And the Sandman flies on an umbrella. You can wear an umbrella to jump out of an airplane, too! We have to try it! - What to try? - Umbrella. - Have you finished your picnic yet? - Not really. - Where's Lisbeth? - She's over there at the... a picnic. - Why do you need an umbrella? - What if it rains! Rain? Today? Don't make this up. - Put it back. - But you're supposed to take an umbrella on a picnic! - We'll get wet! - And you guys hide out on the porch! - Well, Alva... - Take it, take it... Just put it back before Dad gets here! - You're taking a long time. - Alva apprehended. Well, let's go... Madicken, you're out of your mind! Oh, there's nothing wrong with that. People are jumping out of planes, which is much higher! - Is that what airplanes sound like? - Yeah, Abbe told me. Well, I flew. It's awful how fast! You what? Are you dead? Madicken, say something! Mom! Help! Mom! Hey, you there! Why are you shouting like that? Help! Help! Madicken is dead! What the hell happened out there?! No... My girl... It's over. It's over for sweetheart. Madicken of Unibakken... Oh, my God! Calle! This is the final proofreading. Hurry up! "The Worker's Herald. Wait a minute... Tell him I'll come back later. Editor Engström. Hello? What? Yeah, but what happened? No... What did the doctor say? Yeah, I'm coming... Baby, what have you done... - Concussion. - Ay-yi-yi, this is bad. I'm sorry I broke your umbrella. You almost broke my favorite girl. It's much worse... Stay still! You have a concussion. It doesn't kill you, it just makes you sick. And I let her borrow an umbrella. If I had known that she's gonna jump him! That stupid girl is making it up - just hold on! And those who jump out of planes, don't get a concussion... If God wanted people to fly, he would have given them wings! Then he would have made you you're a crow - you're always cawing! - What did the doctor say - how long does she need to lie down? - Three days minimum. - How nice of you to come! - It's all right. It could have been worse. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too. - She's more fun today. - Yes, thank God. Write only about the smart stuff! And come back early. - I always write about the smart stuff! - Of course. Hey, Dad, wait for me! - Go to bed! - I'm already healthy! I said get down! The doctor told you to lie down for three days. I have a picnic at school today! No way! You've already had one picnic. - You're going to lie down and throw up! - Aah! I want to go too! The train will be leaving soon... All my classmates are already sitting out there, talking and having fun. And they'll be sitting on the hill and eat sandwiches... That's it, the train's gone... Madicken, you fool! Three postcards and a package came for you. - Really? - Yeah. But it's not my birthday! Well, have a little fun. and it's not bad for us. - Pretzels from Abbe. - Oh, he's so cute! A package from Grandma. She was very upset. - Who are the cards from? - It says, "From a friend." - It's also from Abbe. - Why would he send three at once? - How beautiful! - Let me see! Lie still. Concussion is not to be played with! Who's playing? Certainly not me. You're not interested in what's in the package? - Do you think I should see it? - Yeah. Look, pookie! I want a concussion, too! Rings! Take one for yourself. Which one do you want, the blue one? with a rock or a red one? - With green. - There is no such thing, silly! - Then I'll take the blue one. - Here you go. My pebble looks like a drop of blood. What's yours? Mine looks like... blue. - You can have more beads. - Thank you! It's good that you're going back to school. It's no good. Everyone's gonna be talking about the picnic. Well, you tell them about yours! ABVHD, The cat was swimming in the water, The cat was swimming in the water And catching fish! You're in the water yourself! ABWGD, the cat was swimming in the water... What happened? Why did you come back? We're going on a picnic today! He wasn't there that time! Why? The teacher fell down and so did got a concussion! - Imagine my luck! - Yeah, well... - Where's my sailor suit? - In the closet. And I also need meatballs! Sit down! Hurry up! - Freken! - Yeah? Oh, I'm so glad you have one, too. there was a concussion!
