Stop it! Stop, stop it! Stop! You shouldn't depend upon only one technique. Maybe this particular technique works for her. Might've been for him or him. Truth is different for everyone. Remember the technique that works best for you, from your training. Find it, apply it, go with it. Officer Derrick! Yes, sir! You got it? The whole idea is to keep on flowing until the situation is under control. Get off of me! Stop it! Stop it! Listen carefully, in this situation you girls only have two options. Do or die. Come on! Give it all you have got! Stop, stop it! Well done. Well done. Great job, class. Keep on training. Embody the technique that you have trained. If there is no division between you and technique, every action and reaction becomes spontaneous. Remember, the way you train determines the way you fight. Hey, come on, get her. - Hey, don't let her go. - There she is. Hey man, catch up! Don't let that girl get away! - Come on men, lets go! - Hey, you! Come on! - Move it! - Let's go! Help, help, is anybody in there? Help, open the door please! Please open the door! What's going on over here? Hey, mind your fucking business. She belongs to us. Leave the girl alone. No one belongs to anyone, got it? Yeah, right. Go, get in the office! Ow, oh... We got you. Got you now you stupid bitch. - The cops! - Let's get out of here. - Let's go! - Let's get out of here! Let's get out of here! Thank you. You're welcome. Have a seat. Thank you. Anyway, who were those guys? That's kind of a long story. Those men, they kidnapped me and they made me do really terrible things. Sorry to hear about that. How'd that happen? It happened over six months ago. I just graduated from college. I had my whole life ahead of me. And just like that, it turned into a living nightmare. Ladies night! Yeah, let's get it started! Does anyone notice that guy staring at us over there? - What? - What guy? Who cares? Don't look at me, I don't know him at all. You gotta break up with him. No, you have to move on. Drink, drink and move on. Yeah, that's great. - Ooh. - Hi! - Ooh, look who's here. - I'm Nikki. - Nikki. - Mind if I join in? I think we're fine by ourselves. Oh, come on! I've heard that. Oh, don't be mean, Karen! Nikki, oh! All right girls, check this out. You know what I got over here. This is what I call partying. You take a little chug of this then you're in heaven! You wanna have some! - Pour it. - All right, let's go! Yeah. Nobody will be having an ecstasy moment in here. Yeah. - Cheers! - Oh, you got that right! - Cheers! - Cheers! Oh! Yeah, come on girls. I'm sure you like it. My tongue is getting numb. Hey, you doing all right? You doing all right? Wash it down. Oh, I'm tired. I'm feeling kind of funny. Oh, I'm sorry I'm sorry. Yeah, go ahead and wash it down. Wash it down. What's in this drink? Come on boys! - Pick 'em up! Let's go! - I know exactly the one I want. Make sure you get everyone. Let's go baby! One night Nikki came to my room. He started to put his hands all over my body. He tried to rape me. He was so evil, he was out of control and I grabbed a bottle, hit his head, and he fell on the floor unconscious. I ran for what felt like hundreds of miles. But I couldn't outrun them. Thank God I lead them to you. I'm sorry for rambling off like that. I don't even know you. It's okay. Sometimes it helps to let it all out. I know the pain human trafficking causes. This is a worldwide epidemic that needs to be stopped. By the way, I'm Karen. I'm Brandon. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So what do you do? - I teach Jeet Kune Do. - Impressive. Do you think I can do Jeet Kune Do? Why not? Okay then, please teach me. - Whenever you're ready. - 'Kay. Thank you. Do you think I can borrow your phone? I really need to call my dad. I just wanna go home. Of course, but if you don't mind, I'll give you a ride. Okay, thank you. - Hello. - Hi, it's Karen. Karen? Dad. Karen, is this you? I've been waiting so long, I thought you were dead. I didn't wanna lose you too. I'm on my way home. Great, I'm home, come on. I love you, I'll see you soon. I love you too. Thank you for saving my life tonight. It's okay, you don't have to. You must be tired. Go and get some sleep. Good night. Dad! Oh, I'm so glad you're alive. I thought I lost you. Thank God! Dad, you're late. Where have you been? I'm sorry, Dots. I had to take care of some business. I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about Mom. It's too bad I can't see her any more. I miss her so much. I wanna see her smile at me. I wanna see her mad at me. I wanna see her do everything moms do with their kids every day. Maya, my daughter. I can feel the emotion you are going through. But you have to deal with it. That's life. Let me tell you something, it might help you out. If you really wanna see someone with your heart and soul when they're not around you, just close your eyes and take a moment of silence. Sometimes your open eyes cannot see what your closed eyes can see. Trust me. Just close your eyes and try it. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, Dots. I love you, sweetheart. Every moment I'm with you, I wish time wouldn't fly. I just want to capture the time for a little bit longer and get lost in your beautiful eyes and your sweetest smiles. Every breath I take, I smell your sweet fragrance coming out of your body. Everywhere I go, I feel your strong presence and heartbeat. Whenever soft rusting sound comes by the leaves blowing around me, I feel you whispering something to me. I don't like what I'm hearing. Fix the problem! I don't wanna hear it again! Brutal, relax, relax. Don't worry. I am worried! You better make this happen. - I told you I'll handle it. - You better! I'll talk with you later. And you... - Fucking, shit! - You got your ass kicked by a girl. And, you let her escape. What happened to you? You know what your problem is? You're always messed up on drugs. Not to worry. Our guys are already out there looking for her, all right? Nikki, I don't give a shit what she did to you. - Fuck! - I want the hard drive back that she took. That drive holds all the going-ons of our business. If that falls into the hands of the police, all of us are gonna spend the rest of our lives - behind bars. - I know, I'm sorry! I promise you, I'm gonna find her, I'm going to track her down, right? I'll get her. Let me give you a little FYI, son. Look, it's not just me in this, Brutal is equal partner in this business. And you heard what happened. To say he's unhappy is a fucking understatement. Let me make this clear to you, without Brutal, our dreams of taking this business to an international level is never gonna fucking happen. You take things a little too seriously, right? Chillax! I got this, all right? You're handling it so fucking well, aren't you? Hey, shit happens! Well more shit's gonna happen, Nikki. Get out, I need some time here. - Are you fucking serious? - Nikki! Get your ass out! Damn, all right! Damn, old fucking geezer. Jesus Christ! Yeah, I'm there soon. Grecco, you be there on time! Talk with you later. You girls look great tonight. Good luck, girls. Bye, see you. That's what I'm saying. Here we go! All right guys, follow me. What the fuck happened to you guys, huh? We got a problem. She got away. What are you saying? This guy out of nowhere, shows up, and starts defending her. Protecting her. One guy? That's not what I paid you ass wipes for! The fuck! He was like not a regular guy. He was like some ninja, or some mountain fighter. Some army guy from Nepal. Gorkha protector. Fuck! He's badass, boss. Badass! I want word out, every thug, every gang member, every cop. Where do I go? 'Kay, you take care of downtown L.A. What about me? - You take care of Hollywood. - Yes, sir! All right. Who can solve the rest of this problem for me? Anybody? Bobby, would you like to try? I can't do that. All right, anybody else? Hey, Ms. Crosswhite, I'm pretty sure Maya can do it. I know Maya can do it, she solved the last one. Anybody else? All right, Maya, would you like to give this one a go? I'll try my best, Ms. Crosswhite. - Very good, Maya. - Here you go, Ms. Crosswhite. Thank you very much. That was too easy. Hey! All right, kids. The rest of you need to work on your homework a little harder. Boo! Dad, you scared me. I'm sorry, Dots. So how was your day? It was good; I had a great time in math class. I know, you are the best in math in the whole family. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. How about some ice cream? Oh, you got it. What kind of ice cream do you want? I want Oreos cookies and cream. How about mango? You don't like mango? Come on, Maya, we'll have some good time. Can't wait, Dad. Hey, Nikki, we found Brandon here in downtown. Where's that bitch, Karen? Not here. Well, keep tracking her down! - Okay, Nikki. - You got it, Nikki. Fucking morons. Hi, everyone, how is it going? - Hi, guys. - Hi, Maya. Welcome back to the store, sir. Thank you very much, how you doing? What can I get for you? May I have the Oreos cookies and cream, please? All right, here you go. All right, Maya, get your ice cream now. And now for you. Enjoy. - Hey, Avery, hey, Mia. - Hi, Jasmine. Hi. I gotta go to teach. Would you mind giving Maya a ride? Of course, I'd be delighted to. Thank you very much. - You're welcome, Brandon. - I really appreciate it. All right, Maya, you're gonna have a ride with Jasmine. All right, girls, you have a nice one. - Thank you for coming! - Bye! You know, life is unpredictable on the street. Today I'm going to teach you how to defend yourself. Let's go! This time I'm gonna get you in the car. You are kidnapped! Now you got it! Now you are doing all right. I can see that. Good! Now I'm going to get you in the car, come on. Come on, you're too slow, you gotta be faster. Every extra second you take can be the difference between life and death. I can't, you're holding me too tight! What do you want me to do, be gentle? Come on, be spontaneous and react fast! All right, you got me. Come on, finish strong! You want me to break your hand? Or they'll break yours. Stop! Stop! Come on, Karen, you can do it! Come on, you're better than that! I can't, I'm too tired. - Mm mm mm. - I can't. If I stopped every time I was tired, I wouldn't be here today. Control your mind or it will control you! Come on, you can do it! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Relax, relax. I'm proud of you. You did a great job, I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. You all right? You did great job, I'm proud of you. That was good. At least you can get me some water. Of course! You all right? Just a minute. Hello, Bee Martial Art Academy, how can I help you? Master Brandon, this is Randy. I'd like to train with you. Where exactly are you located? Yeah, we are located in Pasadena on Fair Oaks. Right in the corner of Glenarm and Pasadena. I'm an MMA fighter. I have an upcoming fight. I heard about you and your fighting system. I need you to train me. I really want to win this fight. Great! So, we'll see you on Saturday, all right? Great, thank you so much! Yes! You know what, you did pretty good. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Guess I just have the best sensei in the world or something. Are you free tonight? My father and I are going out to dinner and we want you to come. You know what? I got something going on tonight. - Maybe next time. - Please? He's dying to meet you. You sure? - Hey, you! - Hey! I'm sorry I'm late. You know, L.A. traffic. That's okay, come on in. - Thank you for having me. - Okay. Dad, Brandon's here! Okay, I'll be right there! - Show him in. - Come on. Thanks. Brandon, I'd like to welcome to our home. Thank you for having me. Well, we are happy to have you. I think we should have a toast. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Brandon, I just wanna thank you for saving my daughter's life. Seriously, you don't have to say thank you to me. As a human being, the prime purpose of our life is to serve and to show compassion. - Right. - Most importantly, - the will to help others. - Yes. You don't need any reason to help others. You just do it with your open heart. I believe that when we're helping each other without any expectation in return, the world will be a much better place to live. - That's right. - With peace, love, - and harmony. - Well said, Brandon. I admire you. I really appreciate you teaching her self-defense. I know how to defend myself, and Brandon is here with us. I'm sorry to interrupt, you know, I gotta get going. Someone is waiting for me, and it's very important. Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Mr. Van Deck. - Likewise. - I'll walk you out. All right, good night, have a nice one. Good night, have a safe drive. Good night. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much, Karen. - Goodnight. - I'm glad. Hi, Dad! Hey, Dots, how's it going? You all right? I'm good, I just wanted to show you a surprise. Tell me, what is it? Promise you won't get mad. Come on, tell me what's going on. Please, Dad, just close your eyes. Okay. Make sure you don't open them until I say so. All right, all right, okay. - Pinky promise? - Okay, pinky promise. You can open your eyes now. Wow! What a pleasant surprise. Where did you find him? Well, I heard someone scratching on the door and I opened it and it was him, so I let him in. Isn't he cool, Dad? Yes, he is, I like him. And he's so friendly, ooh. So, can we keep him? I know you love dogs. But his owner must be looking for him. You can keep him for tonight. Okay, good night, have a good one. Good night, Dad. Right here. Good boy, good job. Right here. Give me a kiss. Let's go girls. Girls, line up. So, what's up with the new recruits? Well, the girls are ready for business tonight. - Great job, Vi. - Thanks. Get 'em ready for Hollywood Boulevard. You got it, Brutal. Get over here. You're still my girl. What's you're name. Okay, girls, listen up. Your first priority is to make the clients happy. You do whatever they ask you to do, got it? - We get it. - Mm-hmm. So, are you ready for tonight? I'm a bit nervous. I've never done this before. Yeah, I was nervous my first time too. That was like last week, so I guess I'm okay now. Hey girl, like to take a ride with me? - Get the fuck out of here. - Hey, no one fucking - talks to me that way. - Get your hands off me. Fucking bitch get in the car! Hey, let her go. Who the fuck are you? Now you're a dead man, you don't know who you're messing with. Hey you motherfucker, do you wanna die? Who the fuck are you? Who do you think we are? Definitely not the good guys. Nope. - Shut the fuck up! - No problem man. Get out. Fucking, mother fucker! Ooh, they're here. Let's go, Maria. Come on, let's go have some fun! Welcome to the party, ladies, we about to have a good time, all right? Party time! It's good to see, Prince, again. Hi, girls. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome to the party. Tonight, you are my guests. Remember, you make me happy, I make you happy. Amazing. Beautiful. Lovely. Party time! Okay, Boss. I'm here for the girls. We're on our way to Hollywood. I'll call you when we get there. Okay, Boss. - Hi, girls. - Hi. May I present, Sheik Halid? Hello, Sheik Halid. Hey, girls, wow, wow, wow! I love that! Are you guys ready for the party? Always ready for a party. Ready, mm-hmm. We're ready too! Let's go, ladies! Let's go. We're going to have some fun tonight. Wait here, I'll go get the car. Nice suit. I love that. Do you wanna dance? Yeah, I can't wait to dance. We're going to dance a lot! Let's go. Let's go. Dad, last night, I had a dream about that dog. He came scratching on our door. I guess he misses me. I do. Can we get a dog? I'll think about it. All right, Dot, have a nice one. I will, Dad. Can I ask you something? Of course, what's that? Do you still miss Mom? You know what? For many years we lived together. Every battle we fought together. Now suddenly she's gone. She even took my son with her. In fact, sometimes I'm really mad at her. Do you think she still misses you? It's okay, Dad, forget it. - Bye. - Bye, Dots. Have a great day. - You too. - See you soon, Dots. Here she comes! Let's go, boys! We're gonna get her! Hi, Maya! Hi, guys! - What! - Whoa! - What's happening here. - Hey, Maya. Give me your homework. Why didn't you do it yourself? You talk too much. Charlie, Giant, Mouse, get her! Hey, what's going on? - Oh, no, it's Ms. Crosswhite, let's get out of here. - Are you okay? - I'm good. What's going on? Those boys were trying to get my homework. Those boys were asking for it, but you need to be careful. You're the black belt. You might end up hurting one of them and get in trouble yourself. - Hi, Mr. Levi, hi, Ms. Crosswhite, and Dad? What are you doing here? I called your dad in here to talk about you and your actions with those boys in the playground this morning. Yes, Maya, Ms. Crosswhite told everything. I understand you did this for your self-defense. But remember, you, yourself are the lethal weapons. Yes, one of the boys' mothers called from the urgent care, he has a fractured wrist. You are an honor student, Maya, we don't want anything to jeopardize your school record. It's important to stand up for yourself, but try to avoid these problems so you can focus on your studies. - Mm-hmm. - Yes, Mr. Levi, but they're the ones who started this problem, not me. Let me tell you something, Maya, life is full of struggles and problems. Don't allow yours or anybody's problem to overshadow your strength. You got long way to go, Maya, you gotta be strong enough to face different challenges of life. Sorry Dad, it won't happen again. Okay, Maya, you can return to your classes. Okay, Dots, take care. - Bye, Dots. - Bye, Dad. - Thank you, Maya. - No problem. She's such a nice student. Mr. Brandon, that was a powerful statement. You're making a strong impression at home. It must be very difficult for Maya to be an honor student and being picked on in this matter. I'm proud of Maya. At least she can support herself. I know what you mean. Anyway, thank you for your concern. - You're welcome. - Mm-hmm. And Ms. Crosswhite, I really appreciate you being such a good mentor in Maya's life. It's my pleasure, she's a good student. I know, thank you. All right, Mr. Levi, it's good to see you. - Good to see you too. - Thank you very much. You're welcome. Everest Dragon, scene one, take one. Action! Taekwondo! - Cut! - Ya! ♪ Hey ya don't you know ♪ ♪ Someday you're gonna hear this on the radio ♪ ♪ Hey ya don't you know ♪ ♪ I gotta take it slow ♪ - Hi. - You're late. Oh, you took forever. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. It's okay. Why so serious? Give me a smile. I guess I'm not really the smiling type of guy. Well, you look nice when you smile. Am I irresistible now? What's so funny? So, what took you so long? They were filming in Hollywood Boulevard. A boy was doing nunchuk, nunchaku. Oh. He reminded me of my childhood. Well, it's Hollywood, there are all walks of life here. So, if you don't mind me asking. Who's that woman in the picture on your office wall? - That was my wife. - Was? The journey of my life was heading in the right direction. Everything was happening the way I wanted. I was so happy, and exuberant. I was in love. Hey, I'm Brandon. I'm Rita. - Can I walk with you? - Sure. Oh, there's Dad. Dad, you're late. Mom's mad at you. Sorry, I'm late. I was stuck in the office. Mom has a surprise for you. What is it? Tell him, Mom. You tell him. Just tell me. What is it? I'm gonna be a big sister soon. It is true? Yes, it's a boy. I'm the happiest man in the world. Everything turned into a nightmare. She was raped and murdered by human traffickers - in my home country, Nepal. - Oh, no! She was nine months pregnant with my unborn son. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. I was enlisted in the Gorkha Army and fighting against the terrorists in Afghanistan when it happened. I thought the police would protect her, but they were all in on it. I should have been there. I should have protected her. I should have protected her. It's not your fault, and you can't go through life living on with this guilt. I'm really sorry, Brandon, for your loss. There you go! Got him. Let's go. Girls, you ready for tonight? I'm kinda nervous. Why are you nervous, relax. Have fun, enjoy yourselves. Brutal! Hah, what's up? Where is Greco? He didn't make it. You just go ahead and worry about getting that girl to the boat tomorrow. Let me worry about that supposed to be kung fu master. Make sure you organize the gym for my upcoming fight with that motherfucker Gorkha. You got it, Boss! Girls, drop those gloves. Time to party. You two get the fuck out of my way. Move it, guacamole! All right, it's your fault that we're in this altogether. - Fuck you! - Shut the fuck up, all right? This ain't just a business. It's a dirty business. - Whoa! - Look, look! Okay! - Ready! - Left. - Right. - Did you see that? Oh, adventurous. Oh. - Oh my. - Oh my God. - Okay. - Tired! So what time do you think your dad will be here? I think he's here right now, bye. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. You too. Bye. Hey, Dad. Nice to see you. Bye! So, the spelling bee went well. Yeah, how bout your soccer game? It was awesome, I made five goals. - Hey look, there's my dad. - Oh. Bye. - Hey, Dad. - Hi, honey, how was your day? Good. Hi, Maya. - Do I know you? - I'm Tony. Your daddy asked me to pick you up. But why? He has a very important meeting he has to attend. Are you one of my dad's students? Yes, I'm one of the senior students. Okay. Here we are. Come on, Maya, Daddy's waiting for you. I think I should wait for my dad. This doesn't feel right. Don't do this to me, let's go! - Let go of me! - Come on, Tony, get her! Don't let her get away! Get after her, let's go! Let go of me! Ya! - Now we got you, Sweety. - Let go of me. - Someone help! - Here we go now! Help, someone! - Yeah, we gotcha. - Let go, let go! - Get in there! - Someone! - Help! - We gotcha! - Let go. - We got you now! Help! Go! Good, good. Watch the legs. Come here! Leg flip! Push, good. Watch the lock. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. That's it. That's good. Left, left. Nice, nice. Let's go. So, girls, how's the training going? - Yeah, great. - We're good. Well, MMA is the fastest growing sport in business. I have an idea to take this business to next level. What's that? I'm thinking MMA female fighting championships. Sounds awesome. People will throw money like crazy to see two girls cuddling up in a cage. Exactly, that's right. Especially when girls go wild in the cage. - Oh yeah. - It's gonna be a great money making machine. I'm so excited, like this is my dream to fight in a cage. Okay, okay, girls. I want you ladies to spend more time training. None of this hanky panky stuff, you understand? - Yeah! - That's right! Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Brutal, this is Maya, we got her. Relax Turbo, just a little girl. Nothing to boast about. She's not just a little girl, she's Daddy's little girl. I mean she beat up the both of us. Look at my jaw, it's just... Shut the fuck up! Sweetheart, do you have a cellphone? - Yeah. - Can I use it? Sure, it's in my backpack. I wanna call your dad. Let him know you're okay. Hey, Brandon, good to see you, looking good. - How are you? - I'm good. - How you doing? - I'm good. You know what, you look good. Thank you. I came to see you to talk. That's great, but I have to pick up my daughter right now. I see, may I come with you? Sure, you wanna come, why not? - Yeah. - Hop in. - Can I drive? - Sure. Thank you. I don't know where she is. Must be somewhere here. I don't see her. Brandon, maybe she went to a friend's house. That's not like Maya, she would have called me first. Okay, take it easy, she'll be alright. - You're right. - If you want, we can call the police. Here you go, Brutal. Maya, where are you? Well, hello, Brandon. I hope you're having a wonderful day. Who is this? No need to worry about who I am, but I know everything about you. What do you want from me? Ah, relax, she's sitting right down. Daddy's little girl, sit right next to me. Let her talk to her daddy. Hi, say hello to your daddy. - Dad. - Maya! I'm sorry, I should've waited for you. - Maya, where are you? - Here. Like Dad like daughter. Very adorable, isn't she? Very adorable. If you harm one hair on her head, so help me I will... What, whatchu gonna do? You come beat me up? Let me make this real simple and clear for you. Give me back the girl and I'll give you back Maya. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't play fucking dumb with me, you dip shit. Fucking Gorkha soldier. I know everything about you. I know what you're doing, I know where've you been. Then you already know what I will do when I find you. I'll tell you what, this sounds like a challenge to me. If you win, I'll give you back your daughter. And if you lose, you will both die. Just tell me where and when, I'll be there. You just stay next to your phone, champ, and I'll contact you. And by the way, if you call the fucking police, you'll never see her again. - Damn it! - What is it? My daughter's kidnapped. John! Boss want to talk to you. Make sure you organize the gym well. You got it, Boss. I wanna see her smile at me. I wanna see her mad at me. I wanna see her do everything moms do with their kids, every day. Maya! I would like to tell you something. I think you should know it. What's that, Dad? The more distant a person is that much closer that person is. So what if a dream of life turn into an incident, and scatters everywhere? Time can't change the emotions. The feeling doesn't die when one become distant. Love is a relationship between two hearts, a relationship that can't be divided, like any properties or any material things in the world. So what? I know she is not here. I'm pretty sure she's looking down on us in every moment. She is present in every color of my world. My hopes, my dreams are enlightened because of her. Whichever path I may go through, she is my ultimate destination. I'm sorry, Dad. I can feel how much you miss Mom. - I love you. - I love you too. Bye, Dad, I'm late. Bye, take care, Dots. I will. What is your opinion of these new sightings of unidentified objects? With all due respect to the Air Force, I believe that some of them will prove to be of interplanetary origin. During a three year... Good afternoon, Mr. Van Deck? - Oh, hi, Brandon. - Hi! - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. Where's Karen? I don't know, I thought she would've been here by now. Watch out, Brandon! Joseph, Joseph, you all right, okay? Someone please call 911, please! Go and get some rest. Don't worry about it. I'll be watching. It's all my fault. No, no. Why did they have to kill him? Mm-mm, you cannot blame yourself. Brutal and his men are responsible for this. It's all right. Just relax, take it easy. It's okay. It's okay. Are you hurt? Just a little cut, nothing I can't handle. Let me see, okay, I don't want this to get infected. Come, we're gonna clean it. It seems like you've done this before. That's why I went to nursing school. You are good at it. You could help a lot of people. I couldn't help my dad though. They're never going to stop coming for me, are they? I'll just have to run for the rest of my life. Always looking over my shoulder. Wondering if today's going to be the day. I understand how you feel, but you have to quit playing the victim. Don't let those punks dictate how to live your life. I don't think it's ever gonna stop. It's never going to stop! They're going to keep chasing me, and they could kill me. Karen, stop crying. It's okay. We all know life is short. But it's also a fact that life has a long way to go. Nobody knows the exact date and time when the journey will end. All I wanna say is be strong and stay positive. Nobody can harm you. Got that? I'm with you in this fight. I won't let you down, I promise. Where are you going? Hello, Dante. Did you kill that motherfucker? This is Brandon, who is this? Oh, motherfucker is still alive. How did you get this number, eh? Don't worry about your phone now, worry about your life. I'm coming after you. Oh. It's too much. I just can't just wait and watch. Now I'm gonna bring fight to them. Hasta la vista, baby. Get out of here! Hurry up, hurry up! Come on, come on, let's go, let's go! Hurry up! - Get up! - Yeah! Where do you think you're going? - Let's go. - Come on! Please stop, stop, stop. - Settle down! - My dad's gonna kill you - when he finds out! - We're ready. Scream all you want! No one's gonna help you. We're done with you! - Time for a little nap. - Please stop! - No, no, please! - Sweet dreams. No, no, no. - Stop! - Night, night! You give us enough problems, little girl. Good night! I'm so happy to see you ladies, really. And we're here together again. Thanks to Brandon. Hey, you. - Hi, how are you? - I'm doing good. - How you doing? - Good, thank you. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. Grab a chair, join us. Thanks. So ladies, how's recovery going on? Much better now, thanks to you. Mm-hmm. You're truly our savior. How can we pay for it? In this world, if man becomes human, then it would be a pretty big thing. Truly, I mean, all of us owe our lives to you. But I'll have to admit, I'm still terrified they're gonna come back for us. I mean, they were really powerful. Relax, relax. No, we're not gonna let that happen. Brandon is the reason we were able to come back here in the first place. And we're all safe now, there's no reason to worry. Let me tell you something. There's an old saying where I come from. If you give a man fish, he will eat for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he will never go hungry. You know what I'm trying to say. I don't mind teaching you guys how to fight if you want to. Yes, what do you guys think? Yes, perfect. I don't wanna ever be a victim again. I just wanna kick their asses. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. One step at a time. Be there at the academy tomorrow. I will teach you how to fight. Yeah. - Let's do it! - I'm ready. - There you go! - Yeah. See you guys tomorrow. Jeet Kun Doe is scientific martial art. Because all of the JKD strikes are based on the laws of physics. Remember, according to Newton's first law: An object in motion stays in motion until it hits something. In combat you must train to move constantly. It is difficult to hit a moving target. The sum of the force is equal to the mass times acceleration. When you are fighting, your striking force is equal to the mass times acceleration. Third one is every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In Jeet Kun Doe, your strike can cause destabilization, even massive destruction. So the way you train determines the way you fight. How's that for you? Mmm, I love it. Life is good. Yes it is. Sergio. Brutal's on his way. I need everyone to relax, shut up, and just listen. Boss, Brutal's people are here now. - Show 'em in. - Yes, boss. - Hello. - Brutal, I'm here now. Good. - Put Greco on the line. - Okay. Where's Greco? Come on inside. Hey, Amani. Hi, Greco.

I don't want this messing up anything we've got going on. This guy, he's not just a great fighter. Did you know he's a Gorkha soldier? You don't have to say that. I already Googled him. But you know what, I have a master plan. I'm gonna bring him in a cage, I'm gonna finish him off myself. Whatever. Look, I want him dead just as much as you. But you need to be careful with this one. You just sit and watch. Enjoy the show. Well whatever you got planned, you need to do it quick. Time is exactly on our side. No worries, everything is arranged. Bye. Is everything okay, Brutal?
