Meet me at the end of the hall, in the break room. Come on, lots to go over. Now, before I give you the tour, you need to watch this quick training video. I think you'll get a kick out of it. Welcome to Brooke's Hardware. Hi, I'm Tim. And I'm Karen. And it's your first day working here at... Brooke's! That's Tim. And as Silvio Brooke says on page 32. - Watch, watch, watch. - A Brooke's day is a great day. When in doubt, get your handbook out. I love it! There you have it. Think you can do this, you think you got what it takes? Definitely, sir. I know you got what it takes. Anyways. On with the tour. The back stock area, the lumber section, cleaning supplies, paint department, accessories, plumbing department, more paint, more cleaning, and more plumbing. And back where we started, gardening. I think you know this place. And here's the power grid. It controls all the lighting in the store. Don't go messing around with this thing, okay? It can give you some real trouble. All right Sammy boy, you'll learn a lot more on the job. So, let's head up to the registers and get you trained... Brian? Gene. The warehouse lights are completely broken. Nobody's allowed in there until we get that fixed, okay? Sure thing, boss man. Oh, Brian. I'd like you to meet Sam Coleman. This is the kid who's gonna get you through Black Friday. Hello, I'm, I'm Sam. Yeah, hi. I gotta get back to work. Nobody allowed the warehouse, got it? Got it. That is our owner and general manager. The big cheese. The head honcho. Don't worry about him, he gets into moods sometimes. Okay. I'll remember that. Well, let's get you set up for your first day of work, shall we? Come on. All time off requests must be submitted a minimum of a month in advance. Come on, chop chop. Unless, of course, you're sick. Brooke's doesn't tolerate any illness in the workplace. So. Aye aye, Captain. Oh, I almost forgot. Your very own Brooke's employee vest. Looks good. You're a Brooke's man now. And last but not least, your name tag. Oh, um... I, um... Something wrong? No, it's perfect. Of course it is. Looks good. Your box cutter and your walkie talkie will be up with the register. Those are two things you don't want to go anywhere without. Okay, sounds great. I, I won't forget. And remember, a Brooke's day is a great day. Oh Sam, this is Sarah. She's gonna be training you today. Sarah, Sam. Hello. Hi, nice to meet you. So are you excited for your first day? Well. A Brooke's day is a great day, right? Huh, the boy already knows his stuff. You're gonna fit in great. I'll leave you to it, and like you said, Sam. A Brooke's day is a great day? You're absolutely right it is, buddy. Okay. As far as the register goes, it's pretty self-explanatory. You'll learn everything through practice. But here's your three step lesson. I'm listening. Pay very close attention. Scan the item. Okay. Take the customer's money. Okay. And give them their change. Okay. Easy peasy. Okay, you hold down the fort here. I have to go work on an order, and Brian isn't giving me any extra time. - Wait, wait. - Yeah? Aren't you supposed to finish training me? Do you need me to go over those three steps again? No, I just. You'll be fine. As long as you can keep your eyes open, this job is a piece of cake. Anybody can do it. Okay. Look, channel two is a direct line to me. Call me if you have any questions, okay? Okay, cool. I got this. You're gonna kill it, dude. Thanks, Sarah. Hello, welcome to Brooke's. Hey, how's it going today? Hey, you guys need any help finding anything? Welcome to Brooke's. Welcome to Brooke's. Hey, how's it going? Welcome to Brooke's. Welcome to Brooke's. Hey Sarah. Just testing my walkie, but is this all I have to do all day? Are there ever customers? Hey, Sam. Yeah, honestly, this place only stays open 'cause of Black Friday. Other days, it's a piece of cake. Easiest job in the world. Well, I'm actually headed out for the day, so I'll see you later. Nice meeting you, Sam. It was nice to meet you too, Sarah. See you, Sam. Piece of cake. Hey Sam. End of the first shift already? Yes, sir. Sarah said you absolutely killed it on the register today. I'm so proud. Thank you. I really, really enjoyed it actually. Well, can I count on you to be back here tomorrow then? Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you then. Yes, you will, Sam. Yes, you will. Goodnight, sir. Have a good night. Yeah! Good morning, sir. Good morning, Sam. The registers are waiting. $1.25 is your change. Have a good day. Oh, and remember a Brooke's day is a great day. Thanks man. You're welcome. Hello. Nice to meet you, sir. What is that thing? Oh, the sticker? I don't know, it's just a sticker. I'm Sam by the way. Bill. So, how long you been working here? Too long, dude. You in school? Yeah, I'm in community college. Hoping to get in medical school eventually. Dude, medical school? Doctor Sam, huh? Yeah. I guess so. Well, Doctor Sam, maybe you can save me from this job. It's killing me. Wanna help me burn it down? What? Kidding. Geez Sam, But come on. What if we did, right? It's boring as hell around here, and kind of creepy too. What are you doing wasting your time here? I don't know. I don't think a job like this is such a bad choice. I'm having such a tough time with school, and I'm getting the hang of things pretty quickly around here. Hey, I'm not complaining. At least there's finally another normal person around here. Yeah. ♪ A Brooke's day is a great day. ♪ ♪ A Brooke's day is a great day. ♪ Good night, Gene. Gene? Sir? Gene? Gene? Sorry. I was just spacing out there. Long day. Okay. No worries. Have a good night, son. Good night, Gene. Hey Sam, just wanted to say I'm feeling great today. Excited to see you back in action again. Thank you so much, sir. Good luck out there. You're gonna kill it. Put it there. There you go. Oh, head to the back stock area. Brooke's is waiting. Hello? Sarah? Hello? Sarah? Boo! Gotcha. Yeah, okay. You got me. All right, let's get to work. Come on. Hey Sarah, what do we do when something's out of stock? Sarah? Oh! Here we go. Aha! Oh. Brian. It's you. Nice to see you again. Listen, I am so, so sorry. Sarah had pulled this prank on me earlier and I, I was just trying to get her back 'cause. It's really hard to explain. Just, I've just been getting used to the store and I, I know there's no room for messing around and, and, and, and I know it was just a joke, and it will never ever happen again because, a Brooke's day is a- We need you in the gardening section the rest of the day. Yes sir, of course, sir. I'm on it. Hey. Hey! Follow me. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Welcome to Brooke's. Can I help you? Sir? Hello? Is there anything I can do to help you? Sir? Sir. Can, can, can you hear me? Can I help? Hello sir, Sam has to take his break now. Have a wonderful Brooke's day. What the heck was that? Dude, I should have told you about that creepy customer. I can't believe Brian put you on gardening all alone. You've, you've seen that guy before? He's been hanging around that section a lot recently. Just staring at the fertilizer. I told you, Sam, this place gives me the creeps. If you ever see him again, just don't go near him, okay? I won't, I won't. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just, just a little shaken. Just a little shaken. Shake their hand, look 'em in the eye, help them. Welcome to Brooke's. Huh? Hey, uh, Sarah, do you know where a janitor's closet is or something? There's a spill or, I don't know what it is. Something creepy. Yeah. Don't bother. Sorry. Nevermind. Think I found it. "Property of Keith"? "This place is weird." "Gonna write entries about what I see." "-Keith." "Brian yelled at me again." "I should quit." "I was gonna file a report on Brian." "He offered me a raise to ignore it," "I don't know what to do." "I can't take it anymore." "I finally submitted a report, no response." "Customer repeatedly harassing Michelle," "and no help again... Brian." "Don't trust management." "They're part of it." "Something horrible in this store." "I have to find out what it is." What's happening? "Finally going to find out what's happening in this store." Last message. Look at this place. Yeah, this is weird, Sam. Just... Just look at what I found. What? What is it? Sam? Well, those are old Brooke's handbooks from like the '70s or something. I don't know, but, I found this in between one. Oh, shit. Look, dated 7-19-19. I feel watched. Something horrible in this store. I have to find out what it is. What? Holy shit. It's Keith. Keith? He worked here before you started. I thought he must have quit or got fired or something. I never really found out what happened. What do you mean? I don't know. He just didn't show up one day. It was weird. Did you ask anybody what happened? No. Sam, I don't know. People come and go here all the time. I usually just keep to myself. Do you remember what day Keith left? I don't know. Some time in October? October 3rd? "Finally going to find out what's happening in this store." October 3rd. No more messages after that. So now, it makes me wonder like, like... What happened to Keith? So, Keith goes to investigate something and then just doesn't show up the next day? I didn't know him that well, but like... I mean, there has to be an explanation, right? Who do we ask? Dude? We don't ask anybody. What if this is some sort of conspiracy or black market organ operation or something? Well how, how do we find out for sure? I know Gene keeps employee records in a cabinet in his office, but that's, that's too risky. We can't do that. Yeah. But what if we did? Yeah. What if we did? Break time. Go, go, go. You stand watch, I'll look. Okay. Okay. Which one is it? It's here somewhere, I promise. No... No... Hey look, it's mine! Dude, keep watch. Right, right, sorry, sorry. No... No. Oh, Keith, here we go. Sarah, hurry up, I can hear Gene, let's go. Sam. What is it? Say it quick, come on. It's empty. What? What do you mean, it's empty? It's empty. Oh... Shoot. He can't hear us. Trust me. All right. Okay. That's what Keith meant in those messages. They're hiding something. Yeah, this is getting scary. There's some sort of conspiracy here. Just like you said, Keith was on to something, and then something happened to him. There's definitely something going on here. I feel like Gene wouldn't just throw something away like that by accident. No, dude, did you even read those messages? This wasn't an accident. I'm telling you this place is creepy. Yeah well, what do we do? What do we do? Brian keeps secret files in the closet near his office. He doesn't think I'm watching. Did he just? Finally, this job gets interesting. Sarah? When can we go look into this? I need to know what's in there, over. Hey doc. You don't have to say "over." And sorry, I'm on register all shift. Yeah. Okay. Right. No you're not. You're not alone. Brian keeps secret files in the closet near his office. Dang it! What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Who's out in the gardening section right now, huh? What? You're telling me that you left your section unattended in the middle of your shift? I, I, I was- Managers only. Do you remember what I told you? Do you understand English? Yes sir, of course. I thought you wanted to keep this job kid, huh? I guess you wanna lose it now? No, no, not at all. Then get your head out of the clouds. Stop snooping around back here like a creep. And get the fuck back to work. Okay? Sam? There you are. Hey. What's wrong, dude? Sarah, I'm so sorry. I went and checked it out, the closet, but Brian caught me and, it was bad. Man, why did you go without me? I, I don't know. I'm just not good at anything. I'm just... not good at anything. - Hey. - What the hell am I supposed to do, Sarah? What am I supposed to do? - Sam. What the hell am I supposed to do? Look at me. Hey, look at me. What do you think you should do? Oh. Yeah, I think I should talk to Gene and try to figure things out. See, I think that's perfect. Look, anything outside of the store, that's what should really matter to you. Okay? Yeah. You're right. Look doc, I gotta get home now, but let me know how it goes with Gene. Okay? Yeah. Hey, it's gonna be okay. Don't let this job become your life, man. Okay? Yeah. Thanks, Sarah. Goodnight, Doctor Sam. Gene? Sam, to what do I owe the pleasure? Can I talk to you about something? Yes, of course, anything, come in. Sit down. This is about what happened between you and Brian, right? Yeah. I heard everything, Sam. I am so, so sorry. Nobody deserves to get yelled at like that, that's uncalled for. I know. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not so sure I'm cut out to work here anymore. Just, just a second. Sam, allow me to let you in on a little secret. This store, it's teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Yeah, we were hit hard with the rise of those big online players, but you know the one thing that our competitors don't have, Sam? It's the people, the customer service. Now with Black Friday just around the corner, we're gonna need the best possible people on our team, the best. And you have really shown promise. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Sam, have you ever considered working here full-time? Oh, I- I really think that for your future, a full-time path, now that's a smart option. You know, this here is a solid career. You would be on the path to management. Let's be honest. If we want this store to succeed and grow, we are gonna need people like Sam Coleman in the Brooke's family. Huh? For the culture, the commitment, and for the cause. Right?! - Yeah! - Yeah. Yeah! - Yeah! Well, there's no rush on your answer, but if you want the position, it's yours. You, my friend, would be great at it. Just let me know by Black Friday. Sam, we will make sure that Brian learns to respect you, man. Wow, thank you. Thank you so much, Gene, seriously. Thank you so much. I promise I'll have an answer for you very soon. I know you will, Sam, I know. Thanks, Gene. Are you writing an order for this section? Yeah, I am. Okay. Sam, dude. How did it go with Gene? Oh. Actually, actually Sarah, I think I'm probably gonna start working here full-time. Wait, what? Sam, you're in school. You're gonna save lives, remember? Doctor Sam? No, no, it'll be fine. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to work around my schedule. It's gonna be- Wait, no. Sam? Did you listen to anything I said to you? Come on Sam, are you crazy? Do you really wanna get stuck here working full-time? You deserve better. Don't get sucked into this full-time bullshit. Look, I just gotta start fighting for myself, okay? I know I can do this. Gene even said I'm on track to be management. Oh my god. Are you serious? What? Don't you work here full-time? Why is it so bad? I work here full-time because I have to. Well, Sarah. Maybe I won't end up like you. All right, dude. Whatever, enjoy the nightmare. Look, Sarah. I'm really sorry for earlier, but I know this is a great opportunity and I just hope we can be cool. Are we? Are we cool? Don't take this promotion, Sam. Are you serious? I'm just looking out for you here. I'm apologizing to you. I just told you this is a, this is a great opportunity for me. Sam, do you really wanna work in this place, where employees and their files just go missing? Yeah, I do. No you don't, Sam. You have a Brooke's sticker on your personality square. You don't know what you want. Do you, Sarah? Sam, I told you, I told you, and before- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, shh. Let's let's take it down a few notches, Sarah, huh? This is pathetic. I'm going home. Everything alright man? Yeah, everything's okay, Gene. But I wanted to let you know. Yeah? That I gladly accept your offer to work here full-time. Yes, oh my goodness this is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. That's the right choice Sam. I am so happy. We are so happy to have you in our full-time family, huh? Yes, great, wonderful. So happy for you. At least if you don't end up miserable like me, you'll end up a missing person, like Keith. What do you mean a missing person? Nothing, nothing. She means nothing by that. No, I don't mean nothing. Keith was on to you guys, Gene. He knew something bad was happening here, and you got rid of him. This is a huge misunderstanding. Follow me. Come in. Sam, shut the door. I'm telling you, this is a huge misunderstanding. I'm sorry. Look here. Let's see. Yep, there it is. His file is right here. What the hell? I'm gonna be honest with you guys. Keith had a nasty accident during a shift. He fell off a ladder and he got roughed up pretty good. You wanna read it? Everything's here. What the hell, but? No, his journal and the messages. No, we took care of it and he's fine now, I promise. No, no, no. What about if you let us contact Keith- You know I can't give out information like that, Sarah, but everything's here. No, none of this was here before. What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no, no. What do you mean Sarah? Sam and I snuck into your office Gene, and there was no file here on Keith. Don't drag Sam into this. What? But Sam, you found the room, and his messages. We both wanted to find out what happened to Keith. And there was no file here. Sweetheart, documents take time to process. Look, this is all a misunderstanding, I promise. Sam, back me up here. I, I, I, I don't know. This is pathetic. I'm sorry, Sarah, but sneaking into my office like that. That's against the handbook. I'm gonna have to submit a report to Brian. Any objection, Sam? No. Go ahead. Write your fucking report. I'm going home. Good night, Sam. I'm sorry you had a deal with that, Sam. Mind taking this report over to Brian? Then you can head home. I will. Glad to have you in our full-time family, Sam. Have a good night. Don't come back! Sarah, I- Bill? Are you working register today? What? Where's Sarah? She ain't nowhere. What? What do you mean? She got fired, kid. She got fired, okay? I heard Brian yelling at her over the phone. What? Are you serious? What'd he say? I don't know. I couldn't hear exactly. Something like, "don't ever come back!" You know, firing words. So she's, she's not here. She ain't here. Brian! I'll be right back, Bill. Yes? What is it? Do you think we can talk? Come in. What do you need? Yeah, so. What do you need, Sam? Yeah, so I know you're really busy and everything. Anyways, I, I really wanted to ask you about... About Sarah. She broke the rules, which are in place for a reason. That isn't fair, Brian. She has, she has to- Not fair? What the hell does that mean, not fair? A day working into full-time, and you're trying to tell me how to do my job? I'm sorry. Oh, you're sorry? I give you a place in my store and you confront me in my own fucking office. I, I'm not confronting you, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just trying- I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, shut up! Listen, we need you here on Black Friday. All right? I'm gonna be bringing in some temps to help out for the day, but we need full-timers who know what's going on if we're gonna pull through. And if you can't understand the basic rules, that's going to be a problem, for everybody. No, it won't be a problem. Good. You're back on gardening the rest of the day. I'm on it, sir. Go! Sarah? I know you're not even here right now, but I'm gonna figure this thing out, once and for all. Over and out. Hey Bill? What? If you distract Brian and get him out of his office, no questions asked. I'll give you five bucks. Ten. Seven. Six. Okay. You got a deal. Come on. Brian, Brian, Brian, get out, get out here now! What, what? There's a thief, there's a thief in the store! Where? Front of the store. - Come on, follow me! - Go! Come on! Brian keeps secret files in a closet near his office Jeez. Okay. Okay, okay. "Employee incident." "Harassed by customer," "threatened a lawsuit, fired immediately." No, no, no, no, "False report filed." Oh no, no, no, no, no. Brian covered it up. Accident covered up. Bernard. "Box baler crushed arm, false report filed." Brian... No no no no no. Oh my God. No. Keith. No! No, no, no, no, no. Brian... I'm so sorry, Brian. You know, I've got bad eyes. I had no idea it was Gene. I'll wear my glasses next time. October 3rd. October 3rd... What the hell? What the hell is going on? You have to fight them. You have to fight them! I will. Hey, it's Sarah. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message, or whatever. Bye. Hey Sarah, wanted to try you again. I, I just found out some stuff about Brooke's, and I wanted to let you know I, I, I just wanted to tell you, that Brian covered up so much corruption. So many people were hurt and nobody knows about it, but I'm never gonna let this happen to anyone ever again. And you know what? I'm gonna do whatever it takes to take Brooke's down. So yeah. I have a plan for Black Friday, and Brooke's won't survive it. Gene? Mm-hmm. Have you noticed Brian today? Just listen. And, and the employee handbook says, you can't work if you're sick. I know you know that. I'll go and talk to him. Yes, what is it? I've noticed that you've been pretty sick recently. You can't come in for Black Friday when you're sick. It's against the rules. I don't care if I'm on death's door, I will be here on Black Friday. - Hey! - Don't get involved, kid! No, no, listen to me! If you're really sick, it's gonna be hard for you to run the store and manage everybody. What if, what if I take on the responsibilities of team leader? Just for the day. I think that's a great compromise. Can you do it? I will. Okay. I'll see you on Friday, early. Of course. Sam, I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. Black Friday, here we come. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming in early today. As you know, today is the most important day of the year for Brooke's. This day can make or break us. So let's make it make us, okay? I'll be frank. We need to make $15,000 today in order to pull through. It'll be close, but I'm very confident that we can make it with hard work. So, thank you again to our temps for coming in to help us today. We have a fantastic a team, and I know that we will succeed. We have to succeed. We have to. All right team, Brian's a bit under the weather today. So I've chosen Sam Coleman as team leader, and I couldn't be more proud. If he tells you to do something, you do it. No questions asked, huh? You got this, Sam, come on. Here we go. Bill, Mandy, you two will be on the floor restocking as necessary. Gene will be on the floor keeping customers happy. Ben, you'll be restocking too. Vincent, you'll start out on register. Brian will be in the back, supervising, keeping everything on track. And I am team leader, rotating between stations as necessary. Any questions? That's what I like to hear. Everybody, hands in the middle. Brooke's on three, one, two, three. Brooke's! Brain, how's it going? Are we close to our quota? Yeah we're almost there, but we have to keep hustling. Stay focused. We close in an hour. This is the time that counts the most. We have to pull through. Now, get back in there, go. I'm on it, sir. Here we go. Hey Vincent. Yeah? I think you got this. So I'm gonna go help out in the back. What, are you sure? Okay, okay, I got this. You got this. What? Bill, you're doing a great job. Thank you. In fact, Bill, actually, you're doing such a good job, Um. Brian told me to let you know that if you wanted to, you can take off and go home early. I was wrong about you kid. I know what you're doing. Good luck. See you later! Hey, so I can take over for you now, Mandy. Why don't you head home? Don't you guys need help here? Like? We have a very capable crew, and you'll be compensated for your whole shift, so uh, don't even worry about it. Oh, okay. Bye. Hey Bill, wait for me. What? Uh yeah, they're gone. I, I don't know what to do. Are you joking around, are you joking with me? Hello? Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me, I have to run. I'm gonna be all alone here? No, actually you can head home. You're gonna get compensated for the whole day. Oh, okay. Cool, cool. Hey Vincent, go ahead and take off for the day. You've earned it. We're gonna compensate you for your whole shift anyway, so don't worry about it. Okay, okay. Sam, what in Brooke's name is happening? I don't know, the temps all left on me. What? Everybody's gone. What do I do? Uh uh uh, let me do it. Let me do it. Let me do it. Over here everybody, over here. I can help you. What's the hold up? Gene, are you all right? We can't do this. What? There's too many people, what the hell do we do? I think I have an idea. Well, quit standing there and do it. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, please listen up. I'd like to announce that, um, all further purchases will be full price. That's not true! Discounted! It's all still discounted! Please! I'm sorry! I don't make the rules! No, no, no, no, no! That's not true! Don't listen to him! What the hell? Oh my God. I'm gonna take my break now. Ladies and gentlemen, Brooke's will be closing promptly. No more purchases will be made today. Please head towards your nearest exist. And remember, a Brooke's day is a great day. I did it, Keith. One thing left. Yes, what is it? Hey Brian, can we talk real quick? Uh, um, How's, um... how's everything going? Fine. Why do you ask? No reason just, just wanted to say, just wanted to say something. Okay? Um. Keith, what? I don't have all day. You can't keep doing this. What? What are you talking about? No, no, no, Keith. No! What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, Brian. Let me outta here. I know you're doing something terrible. I know there's something bad going on here. Keith, open this door, right now. I can't let you keep getting away with it. You do not know what you're doing. You have no idea what's going on. I'm going to find out what you've been hiding, Brian. I'm going to find proof. No, no, no, no, no. Keith, don't walk away! No, please, come back! Keith, Keith, please! I can't protect you. Keith, I can't. Come back, Keith. No! Keith, come back, please! I can't protect you! Oh my God, no, no. Shit, no, no, no, no, no, no. Keith, no, no, no, no. Please come back, turn around. Keith, please God, please turn around. Do not go in there. Shit, no, no! Keith, no, no, no, Keith! Turn around, Keith. No, no. I'm sorry. What did you do? What the fuck did you do? I know about everything, Brian. What did you do? It's over. I found all, all, all the shit you've been covering up. I took your keys right from under you. You little bastard. I went into that closet. I found the files. I found the boxes with the files you've been covering up, asshole. Yeah, you better run, asshole. No, stop, I'm serious, man. I'm gonna turn you in Brian. I know about Keith. I know what's in this store. You do? Yeah. Corruption, cover-ups, evil. Oh sweet Jesus. I cannot believe how stupid I was to trust you on Black Friday. I know about Keith. I found his journal. I have his death certificate right here. He died working here, Brian, and I won't let him die in vain. You covered it up, evil piece of shit! You care more about making money than the lives of your employees. You've never been more wrong in your entire fucking life, kid. Oh, just calm down. Oh, I failed, I failed. It's done. The money's gonna be gone soon. The store's about to be bankrupt, and I have nothing, nothing left to feed you. Help me, for I don't know what to do. The only thing that I've done for the last 20 miserable years of my life is to work to keep this place alive. You could live 10 lifetimes and not comprehend the lengths that I've gone to. No, no, I know exactly what's happening asshole- No, you don't! Talk to me. Tell me what to do. Where are you? I've given you everything, I've always been there for you. I need your help, please tell me, what can I do? I have been trying to protect you, to keep anything from happening to you, to any of us. Really? Is that why you fired Sarah? I fired her to keep her safe. Listen to me. I kept those documents to figure this out and to keep people safe. All those people, everyone who got hurt, they all asked questions. That's why they were punished, but not by me. Michelle, Ernesto, Bernard. They were starting to figure it all out, but Keith came the closest. So if Sarah would've come back after uncovering that shit, they would've killed her too. Bullshit, this is you, Brian. This is all you! Shut the fuck up and listen to me. We don't have much time. If you'd like to share your experience with us, find our friendly Brooke's general manager, Gene Knibbs, Gene? Hello? Gene! Gene. No more games. You know that the boss man will never surrender. So now, after all this time, you have our blessing, to take care of it. Yes. Please. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, I will. Yes. I will. Yes! I can? I may? Yes, you may. I will. I will. Your hard work is paying off. No more sitting in the shadows. Let us out this cage. Let us out of this prison. And then, we will be free. Oh yes. Then we will be free. Yes! Do it. Do it. ♪ A Brooke's day is a great day ♪ ♪ A Brooke's day is a great day ♪ Come on, we have to do something. They feed off this place. We have to keep them here. Without this store, they get out of their cage, into the world. It's our responsibility to keep them here. Who? What are you talking about? You can't run from it. Here. - Who? - Take these, take 'em. Sam, take them. He trusts you. Sam, it's your responsibility. I've done this for as long as I can. Listen closer than you've ever listened to anything before. You have to keep feeding them. Sam, feed them. You have to keep feeding them. - Brian? Who? Sam, you have to keep feeding them. Sam. Gene, wait. Listen to me. Sam, don't let them out! Don't let them out! No! Lock the doors! Keep the doors locked! Sam! ♪ A Brooke's day is a great day, woo hoo hoo! ♪ It's show time! Sir. Please. You have to get out. Something, something horrible is happening. You, you have to get out. Just, just go. Sir, please, please. You have to, you have to come with me. We can get somewhere safe. Do you like him? The closest we could get to human so far. We're so proud of what we've created. Do you like him? No. No. You ki- You have no idea the power that they could give us. This is the first one that could actually blend in, the first of many. No, you killed- you killed- Show him. No, no, stop! It's okay, Sam. Stop, I'm serious, man. It's okay, Sam. Don't take another step! You'll never have to worry again, Sam. Stop. I always knew you'd choose us, Sam. Please, stop. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry! A Brooke's day, is a great day. No! No! No! No, Sam, no! No! What the fuck? No, no, no! Stop it, no! What the fuck!? What the fuck? Look at what you've done! What the fuck? What have you done? Why, Sam? Oh. Help me! Now! Sam, you will be punished for this. Sam, get back here. Get back here, Sam! No, no. Don't touch the light. Don't touch it. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Do you know how hard we've worked? What the fuck? Do you? What the fuck? This is what we had before, but then you went and killed the customer. He was the most evolved body we made in 40 years. What are you? Where did you come from? Sam. You should know by now, this store is home to countless souls, damned to hell, souls that would otherwise be trapped forever. Don't you feel it? When I got this job, a voice, it came to me and offered me a deal. If I helped them create bodies, in exchange I would share their power. In exchange, I would live forever with purpose. Brian kept us here for so long. Thought he could stop us. We weren't strong enough yet, but it was inevitable. Eventually we would be able to walk out of the store and claim whatever we wanted as our own. Are you gonna eat me? Sam, no, if you work with us, if you help us, then your future is set. If we want this army to succeed and grow, we're gonna need people like Sam Coleman on our side, for the culture, the commitment, and for the cause. Why are you letting them do this to you? They are mine. Don't be like Brian, Sam. When you let them in, they take away all your fear, all the doubt, it'll be gone Sam. You'll live a life of peace and purpose. Just be a good employee, Sam. It's the easiest way for you. Just, just give me Brian's keys, and I'll know you're with me. If I give you the keys, will I really be okay? It's okay. Just put them in my hands. You'll never have to worry again, son. Sam? Sam. No. No! It didn't have to go this way, kid. I'm not letting you- You were never cut out for this job, kid. Shit, shit. Oh my god. Hey, it's Sarah. Sorry, I missed your call. Leave a message or whatever, bye. Sarah. I, I, uh, Hey, um, I, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die right about now. Yeah. So, uh, I wanted to say some stuff. Sarah, I am really so, so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I was so scared, and, and I'm sorry it got in the way of standing up for you. You were the best thing about this place. And, now, I'm gonna die. Yeah. I'm gonna die. No. No. I'm gonna try and fight my way out of this. Because, compared to this, the real world doesn't sound so scary. You were right.
