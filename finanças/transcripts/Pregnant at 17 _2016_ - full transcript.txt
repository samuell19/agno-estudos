(shoveling sound) Dig! Move the shovel. Dig! Let's go! Dig! You said we weren't gonna kill anybody. Yeah. I lied. (gunshot) ♪ Try this. - What is it? - Try it. It's smooth. Cheers. (coughing) It's so smooth... So whatcha drinkin', sweetheart? Not interested. - Let her speak for herself. - Maybe you misunderstood me. Not interested. I can handle that stuff myself. You know your dad wants me to look out for you. I guess he's pretty busy right now. He really cares about you. Don't ever forget that. Hey. What's up? I... I think I'm gonna go home. Can I have some money for a cab? Sure. - Thanks. - Could you stop by Mikey's, get me a carton of cigarettes? I'm running low. - Yeah. - OK. I shouldn't be too long. Maybe. All right. It's your shot. - Here you are, my dear. - Thanks. Well, look at the beauty that just walked into my store. Lucky me. Hi, Mikey. - Your dad out of smokes? - Yes. I got a couple unopened cartons in the back. Oh... By the way... Did you hear about Greg Foster? No. What? He, uh... He made parole He's gonna be out next week. That's three years early. That's not right. Well, he wouldn't have been put away at all if it wasn't for you. I'm grateful to ya. Chelsea. - Adam. - I'll, uh... I'll just go get those cigarettes. Nah, I can do it, Gramps. No, no, you stay and keep this beautiful young lady company. (laughing) - Long time no see. - And whose fault is that? I've been coming in here at least once a week. I was just on break from school so I thought I'd come help out Gramps. I can't believe you're even standing here. Why is that? Well, I thought you'd be in Berlin by now. Wasn't that what you planned to do, go see where your mom was born and all that? Dusseldorf. Yeah. I am gonna go soon. I have my whole... trip planned out, actually. I just... - Yeah? - Yeah. Here ya are, my dear. (panting) You tell your dad to drop in when he gets the chance, huh? I will. Thank you. I'll, um... I'll see you later. Bye. She's a good girl, that one. (laughing) - Hurry up. Open that drawer! Get the cash in there. - Take whatever you want. You're either gonna be very broke or very dead. It's up to you. - Take it all. - Hurry up! - Yes, yes. Greg? Go, go, go, go, go! (moaning in pain) Oh my God! Mikey! OK... OK... - [911. What's your emergency?] - Hi. I'm at Mikey's Food Mart on 16th Avenue. The store's been robbed; The owner's been hurt. [I'm sending an ambulance. Did you see who robbed the store?] Yeah. Yeah. I know him. His name is Greg Foster. He... he got into a blue car with some other guy. They turned left onto Purnell Avenue. OK. You're gonna be OK. The ambulance is on its way, OK? (honking) I think a trip is the best way to celebrate your tenth anniversary. Oh! Ryan and I love, love, love Buenos Aires. It's called the Paris of South America. Oh, my gosh! Although I think he actually preferred Rio better. Where do you think you'll go? Mmm. We actually haven't discussed that. Have we, honey? Well, no, I... It's impossible for either of us to get any time off right now. - Yeah. - She's six days week at the clinic and, you know, I'm off at a... conference almost every weekend so... I am gonna go find my husband. Mm. Night. Who's texting you? Probably work. At nine-thirty on a Saturday night? Well, it's six-thirty in California. And some people do work on the weekend. Like you do. Be right back. (texting signal) (ding) (beeping) - What's going on? - Ah, I don't know, Ang. Maybe I'm crazy. K, we both know you're not. What's going on? I think Jeff's having an affair. What? I haven't caught him... or anything like that but... I don't know. I just... I know he is. - How? - He's been acting weird and sneaky, and... He always has some excuse to be out of town. - Did you ask him about it? - I did. He just denies it and then he... acts like I'm being overly sus... Hey, honey, do we have any more of that South African... Private conversation. I'll ask the caterer. K, we'll continue the conversation later. For now just play the happy wife, OK? Ang, I'm a vet, not a politician. And I'm a divorce attorney. Trust me. Would you excuse us for a moment? I've, uh... I've got something for you. Happy tenth anniversary. Jeff, I don't wanna do this here. Well, what's going on? Let's just do it at home. (sizzling sound) Jeff, I'm gonna ask you this one more time. And I need an honest answer. Just don't ask me again if I'm having an affair, please. - Are you? - No! I am so sick of you lying. (sighing) (cell phone ringing) - Hey. - Sorry I took so long to call. How are you? [Um... I'm OK.] Hey, when can I see you again? I miss you. [I miss you too.] How 'bout I get us a room tomorrow night? The Randal Garden Inn downtown? We can... order room service, [snuggle up with a movie.] OK. What time? I won't get there till after five, but you can check in as early as three. You know, after you get off work if you want to. [OK. Sounds good.] - Love you. - I love you too. Bye. (exhaling) (loud music) Cheers. You know, I see that bitch sometimes. The one that turned him in. Doesn't she go to school with you? That ho-bag dropped out a few months after his sentencing. You can thank me for that. I did what I could to make her life hell. What? She deserved it for lying her ass off about my brother. Greg just told me to keep tabs on her. Find out what she's doing, where she's going. That kind of stuff. He told me not to touch her. Speaking of touching... Let's go to your room. (coughing) (flushing) - Too much to drink? - I don't know. It must have been the tequila. Do not let Rascal talk you into drinking that stuff, all right? It's gonna rot your guts. I feel like my guts are rotting. - You want some breakfast? - I can make it. I got it, sweetie. I might not be able to cook much, but eggs I think I can handle. Got some good news. Joey swung by the bar last night after you left. He's heading to Alaska for work; Said I could go with him. - On the crab boat? - It's a lot of money. How long? Couple of weeks. Till the season's over. I leave in a few hours. It's so dangerous. Nah. Not if you know what you're doing. Sure. I guess. Is everything OK? Greg Foster's getting out of prison. Mikey told me last night. Two years, it's all he's gonna serve. How's Mikey taking it? You know how he is. Rob a guy, beat him half to death, you get a slap on the wrist. I got friends doing a hell of a lot more time. For what, sticking a needle in their arms? Be safe out there, OK? I've seen those shows where... people get their hands caught in fishing cables and stuff so... I will keep my hands away from any such cables. I promise. So you've been... throwing up off and on for a month, but... last night was the first time you fainted? Yeah, pretty much. I have to stop drinking tequila. It's weird though; I didn't even feel drunk. OK, I hate to ask the obvious, but... have you taken a pregnancy test? I can't stop thinking about her. You know. Who is she? Who is this woman... my husband's in love with? OK. What are you gonna do? Well, he said he was going out of town tonight but, um... They're actually meeting at a hotel. I'm gonna go. Oh... Sonia, don't. I just... I need to see what she looks like. That's it. This is... This is gonna be OK. I'm gonna see Jeff tonight and I'm gonna tell him. Is this someone you've been seeing for a while? Three and a half months. But he's got... a really steady job and he's really solid. And... I know he wants kids. I mean, he and his wife tried to have one a while ago, but... she miscarried and he was really upset about it. His wife? Ex-wife. I meant... ex-wife. Chelsea. Be honest. Is... this guy married? It's really just a matter of paperwork. I mean, they both... want a divorce. How old is he? I love him. That's all that matters. Everybody always gets so caught up about things like age and money, but... none of that stuff matters. Love is the most important thing. - What does that mean? - Liebe uberwindet alles. "Love conquers all." It was my mother's favorite saying. Hey, Liz? I'll be right there. You take your time. I'll take care of these people. Thanks. My boyfriend made a reservation for tonight. - What's the name? - Chelsea Sheridans, but he said it might be under his name. - Jeff Clefton? - ♪ Swimming ♪ - Yeah. ♪ Through the sadness ♪ Here you go.

I didn't think you were coming in today. It's Dr. Westerly's weekend. Oh, yeah, no. I... I'm not officially here. I just came to take care of some stuff, paperwork. Oh, hey, how was the anniversary party? Uh... It was good, thanks. God, Jeff... - Hey. - Hey. I'm happy to see you. Me too. Been counting the minutes all day. Yeah, she does look young. I don't give this girl more than twenty-two max. Why would he wanna be with someone who scoops ice cream all day? I mean, how could he bring someone like that to a work event, or... to meet his parents? No, he can't. It's obvious, or people would think he was insane. All right, Jeff has issues. And they're HIS issues. This has nothing to do with you. Hm. You make my life so damn complicated. It doesn't have to be. We could make things official. I know that's what you want, and that time is coming. I just have some stuff I still gotta work through before I can divorce my wife. How long do you think that's gonna take? You keep asking me that and I just don't have an answer for you. Longer than nine months? Uh... Are you telling me you're pregnant? I... I know it isn't... expected, but... you... you said you always wanted babies and... that you were devastated when your wife miscarried. Um... You said that you were on birth control pills. W... Were you? What... I mean, what happened there? Of course I did. - You take 'em every day? - Usually. I... I may have missed a day or two... Chelsea! Look, if I had known that, I would have worn protection myself. Right? I... I trusted you! Are you saying you can't trust me? (nervous laugh) Look, I, uh... This is... This is just... really unexpected. I don't get why you're mad. (scoffing) I thought you'd be happy. You keep saying that you wanna marry me and have a family with me. And, yeah, I get it. This... this is super unexpected, but it's still what we both want. No. No, this is... This is nothing like what I want. I'm still married, for crying out loud. You're getting a divorce. Your wife has a boyfriend in New York. She's not gonna care. She doesn't... She... She won't understand. (sighing) Hey. Hey. Uh... How far... How far along are you? - I don't know. - OK. Liz said I should probably go see a doctor. Liz, your boss? Jesus, Chelsea. How many people did you tell? N... No one else. I... I should probably tell my dad. Your dad, no. That's... I mean... Why involve him? You know, this is... This is about us. Well, the... doctor probably won't let me sign any papers until I'm eighteen. Did you say you're... you're not eighteen? I'm seventeen. No, no, no. That's... not possible. I met you in a bar. You were drinking. Right? So I don't... I've been doing that since I was fifteen. Oh! Chelsea, geez, what... Why didn't you tell me? - You never asked. - Oh! It's not like I was hiding it from you! - Ha! - The other day I told you that my mom's older than my dad and you said that age doesn't matter. It matters if you're underage. Are... I... I need some time to think. I just have to... go somewhere and think. - Are you leaving? - I'm... gonna call you tomorrow. I just, uh... Till then, can you just... not mention me or the pregnancy to anyone? Can you promise that? OK? Don't go. OK? I love you. I just... need a little time alone. OK? Please? It's gonna be OK. J... Jeff, please... Listen, listen, listen. Hey, hey... We'll figure it all out. OK? All right? We're... We're gonna figure it out. Just give me... Give me a day or two. Right? OK. OK. You know, this is... This is a lot. It's a lot to, uh... process. So just... you can stay here... tonight. That's fine. And, uh, I'll... I'll call you tomorrow. Um, I'll call you tomorrow. It's gonna be OK. OK, good night. (texting signal) (beeping) [Hey, Chelsea. It's Adam. Just calling to see] [if maybe you wanted to grab dinner later or something.] [Um... I'm helping out Gramps at the store but I should be done] [in an hour. And I can pick you up at the gelato place] [if you're working. Anyways, call me back. Let me know.] (sighing) Chelsea, a real man would have been supportive. He should have just... sat there and held you and talked you through it. Thank you. What are you doing with a married guy anyways? I don't know. He told me his marriage wasn't going well and that... his wife was cheating on him. And so I just... I thought he needed me. Are you... Are you in love with him? Yeah. I think so. He's got everything that I want. And what do you want? Someone with a good job, like... The kind you wear a suit to and... go to every day. Something that's not too dangerous. I don't know. I guess I just... want someone who I can... sit in the grass with and watch sunsets with. I'm so sick and tired of going to smoky bars. You know? Yeah, but... What about someone that would be stoked if you told them you were having a baby. Someone that wouldn't just leave you hanging to go home to his wife? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Chelsea... I hope it works for you both. I really do. But just know that you deserve to be with someone who will give you everything you want. (sighing) Chelsea! You lying little bitch. My brother spent the night in jail 'cause of you. Lauren, the cops told me not to talk to you. I guess you better listen then. You need to go back and tell them he didn't do it. I'm not gonna do that, because I saw him do it. There's no way you saw him 'cause he said he wasn't there. Either you made a mistake, or you're lying. And why would you try to screw us? I've always been cool to you. That man is in the hospital because of your brother. Look, I don't have anything against you, but I'm not gonna lie to protect him when I know he did it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I'll catch you later. (engine starting) Thank you. Here's your change. Enjoy. Thank you. Bye, sweetie. Hi. Welcome to Stella Luna. I like your shirt. That's a really great color on you. Oh. Thank you. - Can I offer you a sample? - Actually, no. Uh, I... I already know what I want. I'll just have a small, uh, cookies and cream. OK. Coming right up. But first you have to try this. My favorite flavor. ♪ What do you think? It's basil. I know it sounds weird, but it is so good. Hm. I like your necklace. I'm guessing that you probably got that from your boyfriend. Uh, no, actually. It was my mother's. My dad gave it to me. It's my favorite thing I own. Mm. Yeah, mothers are pretty special. Yeah. She didn't give it to me; My dad did after she died. But she wore it all the time, so it helps me feel close to her. He said that I could have her wedding ring on my birthday so I'm gonna add that to the chain too. - When's your birthday? - November. Let me guess. Um, twenty-two? That's funny. Everybody always thinks I'm older than I am, but I'll be eighteen. That'll be four-fifty, please. I'm sorry about your mom. Thanks. How recent? Um, she died when I was ten. That's not really enough time to get to know somebody, but the memories I do have are pretty great. ♪ Thank you. Have a great day. (indistinct conversation) See that right there? That's the baby's feet. So cool. Is it a boy or a girl? Still too early to know that. At around twenty weeks we'll be able to determine the gender. OK. Would you like to hear the heartbeat? Yes. (baby's heartbeat) Does the father know you're pregnant? Yeah. He, um, he doesn't wanna be involved. Mm. Are you close to your parents? My mom isn't really around anymore, but my dad and I are pretty close. Good. Well, we have resources, financial and educational, for young women like yourself. I'll let you get dressed and we'll go over them together. All right? Thank you. (dogs barking in distance) ♪ Hey, guys. The bartender asked me to bring this over. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. (car honking) ♪ Hey. You OK? Yeah. I just needed some quiet. (motorcycle roaring) I'm not sure you're gonna get that out here. (laughing) Mm. Uh, forgive me for saying, but you don't really blend in with the crowd around here. It's funny. I was just thinking the same thing about you and your friend. Orin. Yeah, we just got some gas down the road and saw this place, thought we'd check it out. Orin's a cool name. I guess so. How 'bout you? You got a cool name? Chelsea. - Nice. - And you are? Jeff. Just plain ole Jeff. Except not that plain and not that old. That's very kind of you to say. Still trying to figure out what you're doing out here all alone, though. - What's wrong with being alone? - Nothin'. It just doesn't seem... Just figured there'd be guys all over you if you were back down there. Yeah, well, they're not my type. ♪ Love conquers all? Love conquers all. - Yeah. - Yah. - Do you speak German? - Ein bisschen. Took it for a couple of years in high school. My mom was from Dusseldorf. I've never been, but I've seen pictures and it looks beautiful. (Orin): Hey, man. Did you find your wallet or what? Yes. Left in the car. Go rack 'em. I'll be right down. Sure. It was nice talking with you, Chelsea. Well, you can always talk to me again sometime. Tell you what. You let me give you my number. (beeping) And that way, I can leave it up to you. Decision's in your hands. OK. OK. Gute nacht. Gute nacht. Chelsea! Hey. You're seventeen, Chelsea. Why would you possibly think it's a good idea to keep this baby? I have nothing... except my dad who's never around. I don't have a career or an education, but I have a baby growing inside me, a real baby with... with a heartbeat and little feet. Do you know what that makes me? That makes me a mom. That makes me important to someone. You're a high school dropout. How can you possibly expect to support a baby on a minimum wage job? You don't have any real income. But you do. Ah, good God. And I can give the baby love. That's more than what most people have. It's more than what I had. I cannot financially support a child if I am in jail. And that's exactly where I'm gonna wind up if anyone finds out that I got a seventeen-year-old pregnant! It won't be like that. Listen to me. I need you to understand the situation that I am in. I spoke to a lawyer. They'll char... they'll charge me as a sex offender! I'll lose my job. There's no way I'll ever be allowed near that baby. - But we love each other. - Could you... stop with the ethereal, whimsical, happy-go-lucky BS! This is real life, Chelsea! Love does not conquer all! (sighing) Hey, just... just... listen to me. Hey. I want what's right for both of us. You know that. There's $10,000 in here. Now you just let me take you to get an abortion and it's all yours. You can go to Germany or move out of here. Anything you want. I am not trying to buy you off. It's only fair. You give me what I want. It's only right that you get something in return. I want this baby. I need this baby. I won't force you to be a part of it. I won't tell anyone you're the father. Take the money. Take the money. (banging) Take it! I don't want your money. I'm keeping this baby, and if you don't wanna be a part of it, you can get out of our lives! Ch-! Ah. I miss you so much, Mom. (sighing) I miss you so much. (cell phone ringing) Hello? - I'm a prick. - What do you mean? - Well, I gave you a hard time about being with that guy and I had no right to do that. It actually meant a lot to me that you opened up to me about everything. Well, it turns out that he wants nothing to do with me or the baby. God, I'm such an idiot for even getting involved with him. Well, can I come over and cheer you up? (sighing) (footsteps approaching) Hey. There you are. Did you work late tonight? No, no, I met Angela for drinks. How was the conference? Good. It was good. (sighing) Did you meet anyone interesting? Not really. Just the same old crowd, you know. (deep sigh) Aren't you tired of lying? What's that supposed to mean? I know about Chelsea. Who's Chelsea? Stop. Just stop lying. I know you met her at a hotel. OK. Yeah, I, uh... slept with her, but just a couple of times and I certainly don't love her. That's just... supposed to make me feel better? No. Listen. I... I knew it was wrong and I ended it. That's why I was at the hotel. To break up. I, I was miserable the whole time. I, I... How old is she? She told me she was twenty-one... but she may be younger. (sighing) I'm sorry. But... it's not like I set out to hurt you or... Jeff, I asked you so many times if you were having an affair. I knew in my gut that you were. And how could you deny it over and over? God. What happened to you? I mean, were you always like this and... I just didn't see it? What happened to me? It's what happened to "us"... Don't try to put it on us! We used to be happy. We used to relate to each other, laugh, have fun. But ever since we lost the baby... No, no, no. Don't go there. That's exactly what I mean. You'll never talk about it. You'll never admit that since the miscarriage, we're miserable. You're miserable. The only thing I ever see in your eyes any more is disappointment. Yeah. Losing the baby was disappointing... But you dealt with it by... running around with a teenager? Yeah, it's, it's... I'm sure it's easier to hook up in hotel rooms and plan secret meetings instead of being a man and dealing with your problems! I never said I was perfect. And yes, I slipped up; I did something I shouldn't have done. But I'm not the first guy on the planet to do it, and you're not perfect either. I didn't cheat on you. No, no, you did something just as bad though: You gave up on us. I don't give a crap about that girl. I want you, the one I fell in love with, who I still love, but... I don't know where she is anymore. She's been gone since we lost the baby. Let's go to counselling. Let's put us back together. We'll get through all this and come out the other side stronger. No. I don't... I don't want that. I'm asking Angela to draw up divorce papers. - What? - Yeah. I think it's best if you find somewhere else to stay. No. Please don't say that. Please. You gonna try? Yeah, I'm pretty sure my doctor specifically told me never to eat this. Yeah, right, she did not. All right. Don't be a chicken; Be brave. (laughing) Nope. - That was amazing. - I did it though, so don't ever call me a chicken again. You're one of the bravest people I know. No, I mean that. Look, what you did for my grandpa, when you testified back then, I know you were scared and you went through and you did it anyway. And I'll never forget that. Thanks. And you're gonna get through this too. I know it. You don't need some successful businessman like Jeff to help you either. You're a tough little thing. - Sonia... - Don't. OK, just... Just don't. (honking) (tires screeching) - What did you find out? - A bunch of stuff. Here's the kicker: She was just at a pregnancy clinic. I think she's knocked up. Really? I'm not a hundred percent sure, but... I think he doesn't want the baby and she does. They were arguing about it in front of her house. And he's rich too. Throwing money around, literally. I'm thinking possibilities right now. I just want revenge for them putting you away for something you didn't do. Look how much you've suffered. And gelato bitch can't make it right... But sugar daddy can. (whimsical music) (ringtone) - Hello? - [Is this Sonia?] - Yes, it is. - [You were listed] [as an emergency contact for Jeff Clefton.] [He's being transported to the hospital.] What? - Woman: [How is he?] - They're keeping him sedated. Yeah, I don't know for how long. [If he has brain swelling...] (cellphone alert) [...you know, they probably want to make sure he doesn't have] [a seizure or something... ] Hang on. She's pregnant. (sighing) ♪ Hey. I remember you. You work down the street, right? Basil gelato? Aw... All these baby clothes are so cute. I wish I could afford to buy them all. Do you have a baby? No, no. I just love kids. How 'bout you? I'm actually expecting. Oh. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Do you have a name picked out? Uh, no. Not yet, but I am open to suggestions. Oh. You know, for, for a boy, Alexander. And for a girl, Annette. Both A's. They'll both be first when the teacher asks them to line up. I never thought of that. Alexander was my grandfather's name, and Annette was my grandmother's. People don't do that as much anymore, name kids after family members. No. No, they don't. What about your boyfriend or... or husband? We are not really together anymore, so it's just up to me. I'm... I'm sorry to hear that. It happens. I still think I'm gonna be a good mom. I actually start a parenting class next week. Oh, that's great. Bye. Oh. Bye. (sighing) This place is really expensive. Chelsea, no budget tonight, OK? Gramps picked the place and he gave me his credit card. - Really? - Yeah. He was thrilled when I told him I was taking you out on a date. So this is a date? I mean, isn't it? I mean, no pressure if you don't want it to be. But this is my best tie, so if we could make it... Why would you wanna date a pregnant girl? I don't see you as a pregnant girl; I just... I see you as Chelsea, a girl I've liked for a long time. Yeah, but eventually I'm gonna have a kid and that kid isn't yours. I'm not sure I get where you're going with that. Why would you wanna bother with someone else's child? You don't think you can love a baby that you didn't create? - No, of course I do. - I would know firsthand, 'cause I was adopted. - You were? - Yeah. I was, by two fantastic parents that love me as much as anyone could. Look, Chelsea, it doesn't matter who contributes a sperm or contributes an egg. What matters is in your heart. After that, it's just biology. And I think you should have some of this. It's my favorite. OK. (Sonia): I don't know. But I just feel like somebody needs to stand up for Chelsea. She's about to become a mother. Yes. That, my love, is not your problem. (sighing) I know, but maybe I can help make a difference in this child's life if I can convince him to take responsibility. What is going on with you and this girl? It's just... the more I find out about her, the more I wanna know. How many times have you seen her? Just a few. Last time we talked about baby names. OK, Sonia! Mm. I'm sorry. I can't explain it. I just feel some sort of connection to her. And I don't know, maybe it's because we both lost our moms at a young age or because we were both duped by the same guy. But Ang, she is not this evil little homewrecker. She's... she's really sweet and... nalve. Thanks for dinner. It was really nice going on a real date. Yeah. Maybe we can do it again when I get back. You going somewhere? Yeah, just for a few days. I gotta go to Ohio. My cousin's getting married. Kinda have to go. I'm in the wedding so... Sounds fun. Yeah. So is that a yes? I can take you out again? That... that is a yes. Cool. Well, good night, Chelsea. Good night. (Jeff): Thanks for coming. I can only imagine what you're feeling, me having a baby with her and not with you. You have no idea what I'm feeling. I wasn't trying to get her pregnant, Sonia. I offered her money to get rid of it, but... You tried to pay her off? You know as well as I do that it makes no sense for her to keep it. She's too young and I have no desire to be involved. Do you hear yourself? Do you understand the ramifications here? If she keeps the baby, eventually everyone will realize that I knocked up a seventeen-year-old. I don't deserve to be on some sex offender list like a creepy pedophile. She's about to become a teenage mother. You owe it to her to help her. I owe it to myself to do what my lawyer tells me to do. I don't know who you are anymore. Here ya go. - Hi. - Hey. I'll have a basil gelato, please. Got you hooked on that one, didn't I? Yeah, I crave it. Um, I brought you a little something. Thank you. Yeah. I just thought you could use them. One basil gelato coming right up. Thanks. And I never even finished high school so... You dropped out? Why? My grades were fine and all. I just... My dad wasn't really around much so it was hard to get a ride. And then when he actually was home, he often stayed out late. So it was... Wait a minute! No way. Oh, my God! I know him. - Who? What? - I gotta go. - Are you OK? Yeah. I'm just gonna try to catch a bus before it gets dark. - Hang on. Let me drive you. - You sure? It's pretty far. - It's fine. - OK. Um, we have to go now. So, who was that guy? Mikey warned me he was getting out but... I didn't think he'd come looking for me. Honey, I think that instead of taking you home, I should take you to the police. You need to tell them what happened. But... what are they gonna do? It's not just me anymore. I have to think about my baby's safety too. He's right here. Greg Foster. As a condition of his parole, he can't make contact. He didn't, did he? We didn't give him a chance. OK. I'll let his parole officer know. In the meantime, Chelsea, do you have someplace else you can stay? Relatives or a friend's? Um... She can stay with me. Uh... I live in Huntington Heights and we have a security system. We? Oh! My, my... my husband and I. But we're separated, so it's just me. Good. Now if you see Foster lurking again, call me. If he does anything that allows me to arrest him on a violation, I will. Here's my card. - Thank you. - Absolutely. Hi. Ready? Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, you're being really nice, but you don't even know me. Chelsea, uh, I need to tell you something. When I came into the gelato shop, it wasn't an accident. I wanted to meet you. Why? Because Jeff, um... your Jeff, is... he's my husband, soon to be ex-husband. What? Did he put you up to this? No! No, not at all. He doesn't even know we talked. Why is everyone always lying to me? Chelsea, please, let me explain. I want you out. I told you everything about me. Stop. You need to hear what I have to say. Jeff doesn't know I'm here. I suspected he was having an affair, so... I went to the hotel where you and he met. I just needed to see what you looked like. Anyway, I was shocked at how young you are and... I just wanted to know more about you. That's it. Well, now you know everything there is to know. No, that doesn't... That's not it. When I first met you that day, you were just so sweet. You know, I genuinely liked you. I wanted to hate you, but it was the opposite. And then I realized that we'd both been played by the same person. How can you say that you were played when you did the exact same thing? - What? - Your boyfriend in New York, the one you hid from him for months. Is that what he said? What a jerk. I... I didn't have a boyfriend in New York, or anywhere else. I was completely faithful our entire marriage. Chelsea, he lied to us both. And he's trying to get out of supporting your baby and that's wrong. OK? You can't let him do that. He wants nothing to do with it. Hey. Everything's gonna be OK. OK? I promise. So where's Jeff staying? Is he with a friend or something? Uh, he is in the hospital, probably for another week. Why? (texting signal) - Text from Cassandra. Would you like me to read it? - Yes. "-" Emergency here. Dog hit by a car. Westerly is requesting your assistance." - I'll be right there. - Sending "I'll be right there." We are gonna have to swing by the clinic. OK? Yeah. Yeah, of course. OK, sweetie. Hang on. Just need to get you stabilized so we can check for internal bleeding. Good girl. OK. Have you ever had a pet? Nah. My dad never really wanted any. (purring) Well, maybe... we could take her home with us tonight. Can we? I'll get a crate. OK. Did you hear that? Is everything OK? I'm really sorry for breaking up your marriage. Chelsea, you didn't break up our marriage. Jeff did that. I still feel bad. You're a good person. You deserve a good guy. So do you. Do you need your bag? Oh, my vet bag? No, we can just leave it in the car. Can I ask you something? Of course. Jeff told me that... you lost a baby. Is that true? Yes. That part is true. I got pregnant a year and a half ago. I miscarried. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. At least that part wasn't a lie. You know... the one thing I know I've always wanted was kids. You would have been a good mom. You actually remind me a little bit of mine. I do? Yeah. - [I've got your freedom paperwork finished!] - Chelsea's here. - [What?] - It's a long story. Don't ask any questions. But, um, I'll look at the paperwork when I get some time alone, OK? [OK...] (doorbell) Listen, I've gotta run. Someone's at the door. [Call me tonight.] OK, I will. Bye. Special delivery. Hello, Chelsea. Now that we're all here... let's get down to business. Here's what's going to happen next. You, Sonia Clefton, are gonna write a check to Chelsea for 50 grand. And Chelsea and I are going to go to the bank and cash that check. My companion is gonna stay here and keep you company. (muffled speaking) What? What, what, what? Ah! Speak. The bank won't cash a check that large. She's gonna have to deposit it and wait for the funds to transfer. Well, I need that money. So you need to figure it out. OK. OK. We... We have cash in a... - Spit it out. - We have cash in a safety deposit box. How much? 25,000. And... with the jewelry inside, and the money it's... it's way over fifty. I want to explain my little insurance policy so that we're all very, very clear. While I'm at the bank with you, she's gonna take Chelsea to an undisclosed location. If my companion doesn't get a text from me by 5PM saying that I have the money, Chelsea dies. And so does her baby. As long as you do what I say, everyone's going to be just fine. Lauren and I will be long gone and you'll never have to deal with us again. - Please, just let me... - Shut your mouth! Make this easy. All right? Let's go. Chelsea really won the lottery when she found you, huh? Whatever you think Chelsea owes you, I'll pay it. Whatever it takes to get everything back to even. Yeah, that's something a rich person would say. No amount of money can make things right. It's 3 years of my life, gone... forever. You're right, but... the next 3 can be very different. Chelsea's just a child and so is your sister. Don't drag them into something that you and I can work out. I like how you think. Let's start with the bank and we'll see where this goes, huh? Lauren, he's not gonna let us go. - He said he would! - You're out of your mind. I already called the cops on him once. Lauren, he's gonna kill us unless you stop him. And you're gonna spend the rest of your life in jail. - Shut up! - Lauren, I... I said shut up! Get in line. Where are we going? You'll find out very soon. May I help you? Hi. Um, the name is Sonia Clefton, and I'd like to access my safety deposit box, please. OK. If you need anything else, I'll be right outside. Let's go. Open it. Very simple. Close it up. Call him. We're done in here. - Is everything OK, ma'am? - Sonia, we've gotta hurry. We've gotta go or we're gonna be late, huh. OK, well, if there's nothing else I can do for you, you folks have a fine day. We will. Thanks again. Drive. You got what you wanted. Text your sister. Change of plans. We're going to tell her in person. Now turn on the car and drive. Drive! Walk that way. Sit down and don't move. - Pull over. Right here. - OK. Shut it off. Get out. Come on. Get out! Against the car. Turn around. Turn around! OK! OK. It's my turn to drive. You crazy bitch! Sit down! Are you stupid? Do you want to die right here? Put that down. Don't move. They're here. Let's go. Get out. Chelsea. I am so sorry. Did you get the money? 25. Just like she said. Plus a few other surprises too. Good. Let's get the hell out of here. Sis, go get those shovels. What shovels? Right there. Go get them. Do it! Go! Greg, what's going on? First thing these two are gonna do is go to the cops. - No, I swear we won't. - Shut your mouth. Stop here. Just cut them loose. Give them the shovels. Come here. Right here! Let's go! Start digging. Dig! OK! You said we weren't gonna kill anybody. Yeah, well, I lied. We don't have a choice. - Greg, think about... - Shut up. Dig! What are we gonna do when we get to South America? Sis, I told you, I've got it all planned out. (screaming) What? What? Get your ass up, dig... What the... Greg? (panting and choking) Get off him! Get off of him! You stay there. Chelsea! Stop. Don't move. Greg? Greg? (gunshots) Get behind the tree, quick! OK. I don't see her. - Is Greg dead? - No, it was just a sedative, but only enough for a 90-pound dog. He's not gonna be knocked out for long. - So what do we do? Keep going? - No, just stay here. - OK. Lauren! You killed him, you stupid bitches! (gunshot) Stay still. All right? I'm gonna put pressure on it to stop the bleeding. I don't want to die. Do you have a phone? In my pocket. Call 911. (gunshot) Are you OK? [911, may I help you?] Yes. I need the police and paramedics. Two people have been shot and I think one might be dead. [Any available units in the Woodcrest area, please respond.] [Unit 38, copy that.] Chelsea, she's beautiful. Hey. Are you sure you want to do this? You can change your mind if you want to. I want my baby to have the best mom in the world. And right now I think that's you. You can see her any time you want. I think she needs a name. I want you to name her. Annette. After your grandmother. Thank you. - Hi! - Miss Annette. Oh. Hey, guys. Look who's here! - Sweetie. - Hi. - How you feeling? - A little tired, but I'm OK. - Hey. - Hey. So good to see you. Yeah, you too. I love you. I love you too. OK. That's enough, you two. Have you heard anything from Jeff? Nope! But Orin said that he was fired from showing up to work late. I guess he's spending every other weekend in Atlantic City. I don't know. I don't care. - What a loser. - Yeah. But it looks like you've traded up. - Yeah, I have. - Yeah. - Hey! - Hi! So you ready to go? Traffic looks pretty bad around the airport. We should probably get going. Yeah. Chelsea, I want you to have the best time in Germany. Thank you. I... I still can't believe I'm doing this. I can! Bye, Annie. Be good for your mama, OK? - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - I'll miss you. - Miss you too. See you guys in a few weeks. OK? - Bye. - Bye. (baby cooing) Can you say "bye-bye"? Say "bye-bye"!
