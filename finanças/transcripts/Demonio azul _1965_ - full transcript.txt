All characters depicted in this film are entirely fictitious. Any similarity to actual people, living or dead, is purely coincidental. What's your opinion, doctor? They must've been attacked by a wolf What about you, Dr. Gruber? What is your opinion as a scientific investigator? A wolf wouldn't have mauled them in such a way... ...apart from the wounds that are present in the bodies... ...all of their bones are broken Almost as if they were crushed by a hug Are you trying to say they were attacked by a bear? I wouldn't say that... I am truly baffled After 50 years, history repeats itself What are you trying to say? When I was a child, I remember a humanoid beast that lived in the forest That slaughtered many villagers That's only a superstition, a legend No, doctor There was a mad scientist that lived in the abandoned mansion And every full moon he turned into a wolf! Will you come inside to greet my dad, Lauro? I wouldn't want to distract him And remember, its the end of the course and I have to prepare my lesson You need to study as well, my love- What are you implying? That I'm the dumbest one of your students? If you're not the dumbest one, I can assure you, you're definitely the prettiest one You know that when I became a widower I moved into this town with my daughter, Marina... ...in search of peace and obscurity But I never neglected my love for studies and investigations Keeping myself in contact with scientific academies worldwide Yes, well... Intrigued by the tales of the villagers... ...or as you call them, legend and superstition... I requested the reports on Fernando Salgarol years ago The wise man who 50 years ago... ...lived in the abandoned mansion This is the information that several European universities sent me referencing the investigations that Salgarol was developing at the time With this full moon, and with you by my side... I predict that my biology class will be a mess Apart from talking about science...what else can you do? This is absurd, it's unbelievable... This means that at this time, there is a man on the loose That by scientific means, managed to awaken the beast that every one of us carry inside? ...Exactly! In plain 20th century, and barely 50 kilometers from the city? I've never heard such absurdity In times such as these, where scientific advancement is astounding... Nothing is absurd or impossible I am not a scientist, but, as a doctor I know for certain, that it is impossible for a human being to turn itself into a beast The fact that Matias confirmed your claims only justifies his ignorance But from you... ...that's where I draw the line Don't tell me that Fernando Salgarolo, came from the beyond to turn himself into a wolf Fernando Salgarolo did not die He mysteriously disappeared without leaving any trace And according to these reports, he was originally from Transylvania A mountainous region very similar to this one What's so bizarre about that? That in this same region there are plenty of wolves and mandrake roots Both of which are included in his own experiments (Sarcastically, refering to the howl) It must be your human beast starting another killing spree Why don't you inform the police in order to stop it? This is not a case that can be resolved by the police... ...but by Blue Demon Blue Demon!? Demonio Azul? What are you talking about? I'm talking about a man whose life is surrounded by mystery A man of extraordinary strength and courage That in more than one occasion, has solved impenetrable enigmas First you talk about human beasts, and now to fight them... ...a demon. And not even a red demon, a blue one... You have really gone mad this time Good evening, godfather You look more beautiful every day, and more in love How is Lauro? He's fine, and very much in love as well At least, that's what I think Are you staying for dinner? -I'd love to You'll have to excuse me, I have an appointment in the city What happened, dad? No, I just need to meet someone Don't wait for me, I'll return later. Goodbye Rafael. I have a feeling that everything you've told me so far... ...is connected to the mysterious disappearance of several wrestlers We will inspect that abandoned mansion This is the place where the couple was attacked Let's go Do not shoot, professor! It's Salvaje, professor One of the fighters that had mysteriously disappeared This man has been the victim, or the instrument... ...of a maniacal genius on the loose Let's head on to the abandoned mansion There it is, professor Professor... This lock has been tampered with recently This door is shut down I foresee danger, someone is preying on us It must have weakened with time Professor, this one leads to another hallway Yes, Demon. Let's be careful This lock has the same markings as the one underground It's been tampered with recently (cut off) And in the person that robbed it... ...is the answer to this entire mystery Watch out! Professor, we forgot about Salvaje We need to examine his corpse Chapter II: The Morbid Howl Nobody knows that I'm the grandchild of Fernando Salgarol And that I came from Transylvania to continue his experiments But now all of my plans are in danger And I must go on I need to reach the end First... The awakening of the beast that each one of us carry inside And then... The main stage The awakening of the angel Of the superior man A lineage of super men... ...all thanks to my talent But where could I have failed? And how? Fernando Salgarolo's Journal - 1910 April... ...1909... "Keeping alive the brain of a savage beast..." "Using electromagnetic currents" "And feeding it with extracted juice from the mandrake root" "...One obtains a colorful substance" "That must reach the highest boiling point" "Later, from the vaporization" "One obtains the concentrate that temporarily turns the inoculate man..." "...back into its animal origin" I have followed all of the instructions to the letter but without results May, 1909 "The inoculation is no longer momentary..." "...but periodical" "What is the mysterious relation" "between my findings and the nights of the full moon?" "At times, my recklessness frightens me" "my loyal Marco wants to abandon me" "the substance obtained from the brain of a genius" "will awaken the spark of the human ability" December, 1909 "I have finally proved it" "Everything is possible for science" "But I neglected the most important part of all..." Somewhere inside this mansion... He must've hidden the second part of his journal... Did you bury Salvaje's body without danger of being discovered? Yes, we hid him in the tall grass, at the end of the cliff While you two were outside Blue Demon and professor Gruber payed me a visit But for now I can't take care of them I need to carry on my experiments I need more men like you Now that Blue Demon is involved in this affair It will be much harder to kidnap more partners Are you trying to tell me you're afraid of the masked man? I'm not Well, I am Blue Demon is invincible I was this close to win the championship In a few days, I will fight him and I will rip him apart If you kill Blue Demon while fighting in the ring, no one will blame you I will inject you with my formula that will give you the strength of a colossus Let myself get injected? After what happened to Salvaje? I'm not crazy! The substance I'll use on your body will be completely different It will only give you strength Not the appearance of a monster Besides... I will pay you ten times the amount you would win in that fight If you win against Blue Demon, you'll become famous And World Champion! Alright professor I accept With time, I will have the formula ready Even though everything is feasible for science these days I am sure that evolutionary regression is impossible for mankind Every visionary has been mocked before Jules Verne, for example And now that we are ready to conquer other planets You think the apparition of a monster in our forests is inadmissible A monster created by an evil genius But a scientific genius, nonetheless! Just to find an agreement Let's pretend your theory can become reality with time But for now, it only belongs to the realm of fantasy That is the right word! Fantasy What ever happened to the man that, according to you Transformed from a monster, into a wrestler? Whose body disappeared as if it was magic I dont know... But I repeat to you, someone else witnessed it as well But you deny telling us who it is Why?~ Because I cannot reveal his identity! Father... Isn't it possible that this man was also killed by a wolf? And that his family gave him a proper burial without calling the authorities? No daughter, I say it again, that man... Was a professional wrestler Talking about fighters There is one that is causing much sensation And tomorrow night, if you don't have inconveniences I'd like to take Marina to see his fight for the Championship His name is Blue Demon, el Demonio Azul On my part, there is no problem What do you say, daughter? Of course, I'll say yes! But with the only condition that when we get back You will show me the wrestler's camping spot in the forest They say there's going to be a party at midnight And... Aren't you afraid to encounter the monster? Excuse me, gentlemen. I must go How come you didn't want to mention Blue Demon? Because I have my reasons I beg you to keep it between us What are you thinking about? Father I'm very worried about him Too much work has exhausted him He needs to rest If you're are worried about his mental health You are mistaken I've never met anyone as healthy and sane as him It's the same with every wise man Sometimes they indulge Many times they mix fantasy with reality But it will pass, don't beat yourself down Shall we go? It's getting kind of late I see father has made an impression on you Are you afraid about the monster? No... That's not it I have many things to do Tomorrow I'll take you out and we will have all the fun you want Let's go? Every time we come here to hunt wolves My hair spikes up But master pays us well, no? I think the professor is completely insane Hey... Are you gonna get yourself injected in order to fight Blue Demon? I want to pass on that, I'll probably end up like Salvaje But what if you manage to beat Demon? You'd become famous... And then you wouldn't even talk to your friends... If you're so convinced, why don't you get injected yourself? Me? No, buddy I'm not as brave as you are I'll take chance, let's see what happens Hello Inspector, you never miss a fight, do you? When Blue Demon fights, never. I am a fan, and a friend! Who is that? Nobody knows... In a few moments, it won't matter anymore I mean, the important part is to watch him fight He's the best one there is! He's looking at me as if we knew each other Its like every wrestler knows about us Did you realize how he stared at us? It's just a trick They do that to impress the audience Let's get out of here Lauro Let's leave for God's sake! Take me home I can't have fun after what just happened This jar, contains my grandfather's formula... And this one, my own formula WIth the first jar, I will inject a rabbit And with mine, the other one The first rabbit will only be under the influence of one formula And will only transform with the full moon If everything goes as planned... ...I will experiment with the brain of a genius Like professor Gruber? Don't bullshit me! You said it yourself, he's a genius ...Why not? With my formula The second rabbit will also transform But in one hour it will go back to its natural state, without any lunar influence Everything has followed my predictions Now, I will experiment on you, Ursus No, professor. Not with me! I will pay you a fortune I wouldn't do it for all the gold in the world You coward... I will inject myself... You will lock me in the cell... And when I turn back into my natural state, you will let me out Ursus... You can let me go now, Ursus The risk has passed My experiment has been a success Open! I don't know, professor... What if I let you out... ...and you turn back into the beast? Open up, moron! Can't you see that the moon is not affecting me? Can't you see that I have finally triumphed!? Open up or you will regret it Don't threaten me, professor... You are a danger to mankind I think I better go, and leave you here locked up I don't want to end up like Salvaje and Sanguinario Ursus... There is something you need to know During the transformation, I had a burning desire to escape, to feel free! But when I saw you, I recognized you... And I never even thought about attacking you I swear to you, my words speak the truth Let me out! I will make you rich I will give you everything you want, everything you ask! Don't forget you promised to make me rich If I gave you everything now, you'd leave, and I still need you When the experiments are over I will keep my promise, I am a man of my word What do you want me to do? To kidnap Dr. Gruber? I'll tell you. With time... Chapter III: The Fury of the Beast What? Is the service closed? Not for you, professor. What can I get you? Give me a loaded coffee You don't expect to sleep tonight... That's exactly what I hope for After what happened to that couple in the forest... No one wants to go out at night People are afraid to leave their homes Do you think the story of the beast is true, professor? Nonsense... I am afraid... Why? My shift is about to end, and there is no one to keep me company Besides, I live alone... If you want, I can give you a ride home Thank you, professor! Leave! Leave me! What is happening? Leave, before its too late Poor girl... And yet you still believe the beast of the forest is just a fantasy Lauro and I saw it with our own eyes, when he was fighting in the arena Yes, I know. So did thousands of other spectators as well But the press, which is much more bright, at least confirmed it was all bullshit And the police has had the good judgement of staying quiet... Are you seriously trying to tell me that, in plain 20th century there is a human beast moving around town, killing people? And how does he travel? Automobile? On foot? Does he fly around? What do you think Lauro? I don't know what to think, doctor What's wrong Lauro? Do you feel sick? No, Marina I'm just over-worked, that's all... If you forgive me, I'd like to leave now Will you come later this evening to the parish? Is it really necessary for me to be present? They will have a prayer for that poor girl, Lauro If you don't go, everyone will feel neglected I won't miss It's been long enough, he needs to explain himself What has happened, father? I don't understand... It's nothing, daughter Remember, he didn't want to attend the ceremony because he felt sick But he has changed! He is not the same person he was before The tragedy that has swept the town must have affected him too much To these things that seem absurd, he must feel confused, disturbed even Just as I am... He is a man of science, after all... ...a man of science... You need to rest, daughter. And I have to finish a couple of chores I am sure that Lauro will speak to you tomorrow And you will realize of all this has been a storm in a cup of water Good evening, doctor... Things are even more serious than we thought I just came here to tell you, stay very close to your daughter She is in grave danger. Do not let her go out with anyone I will speak to you later tonight Fernando Salgarolo's Journal... ...second chapter... "January, 1910..." "Yes..". "I forgot about the most important thing " "God exists" "I have murdered my loyal Marcos in the laboratory" "He wasn't able to lock me in time" "Now that I'm back to my human form, and have a moment of clarity..." "...I realize I only have one more thing to do..." "Since I am a danger to humankind" "I will kill myself!" "May God have mercy on my soul" Who are you? Where have you taken me? You are currently inside your son-in-law's secret laboratory Professor Lauro Carral He... He ordered you to kidnap me? Yes, professor That man is insane! I know that... As long as he keeps paying me a small fortune I don't give a damn He promised to make me rich What are you trying to do with me? We will pull your brains out He got tired of having to experiment on wolves But, that is not possible! He says that instead of making a race of human beasts He will make a race of... Super men! You insensate! Don't you see you will end up killed as well? He won't do anything to me He needs me, and he knows that But when he transforms into a beast, he will rip you to shreds! In that case, I will defend myself I'm not afraid of him... I will end up becoming a sage as well, professor This mix...is as good as the best moonshine! We will search through the forest In groups of three or four, whoever finds the beast Scream! Alert everyone else You should wait in the church No, I will come with you! Fine, but don't separate from the group It's useless Demon, don't waste your energy That must be professor Carral Matias! Matias! Head onto the abandoned mansion, and make sure to rescue professor Gruber He is in the laboratory Let's split up, we need to find Demon. My daughter is in danger! No! Don't shoot, no! No! Don't shoot, no! Please, stop! Stop it, no!
