The boy leads with the body, the girl follows the boy's movements. No, I always lead. Rock, Paper, Scissors? Fine. Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot. Got you. Come on. Okay. No matter who leads, the method's still the same. Whenever you don't feel stabilized, just hold on to each other and make sure you don't let go. Grams, what you doing here? Yeah, your mother had two more classes, so CC and I figured we'd pick you up. Can I ride home with y'all? When have I not taken you home, Ian? You live right next door, baby. All right. Now listen, I'm gonna be right over here. Come on, CC. Gonna be over here. Don't take forever. All right. Celeste, I'm outta here, baby. Bye, mama. All right. You want some pizza? I spoke to my dad recently. He say, he's gonna give me a new snow globe from his latest destination. Where's he stationed this time? Germany. Army says, "Be all you can be." I wish he could be here. So, I wanted to ask you something. What? I was wondering if me and you, you and me if, if we could go together. Go together where? Hey, go together. Let me think. Will I or won't I be your girlfriend? Rock, paper, scissors? Deja. Just jokes. Yes. Yes. I remember when your Grams made that Christmas stocking for me. She figured you were over here so much, you might as well have one. I thought I was so lucky. Santa was filling my stocking in two places. So, did you leave me a message in my stock, yet? We always do, don't we? And I was thinking. You know how my parents holiday brunch, everyone makes wish and they burn it, you know. Why, wait? Let's make one now. Yeah. Let's see. So, what are we gonna wish for? It's kind of corny, so don't laugh. But let's wish that no matter what happens, we always hold on to each other, like in our routine. And remember, don't look in your stocking. All right. Deja, come and sit with me for a minute, baby. What's wrong, grandma? I got something I need to tell you. It's not too good, okay. It's your mom. There's been an accident. Can I stay for a while with Deja? Listen, there's no worries. Listen, I'm not going anywhere. But I am. What? Gotta go live with my dad. In Germany? For how long? I don't know. Forever, I guess. She's gonna beat you. Go to her now. Hey. Hey, baby girl. Hey. Now, you getting ready to see the world and you're gonna have a beautiful life. Your mama would want that. So, all right? Grams, you need anything, don't hesitate to call, okay. Okay, okay. All right? All right. Love you, baby. CC, you're gonna take care of grandma? All right. Hey, Deja bird. You all right? Hey. I know this is a big step, but Germany's awesome. There's so much to do there. I got your room already. I can see you every day. You gonna like it? Guess what? I checked skate rinks all over the place, real nearby. Great. - Yeah. - Great. Great. We're gonna have fun. Don't you worry. All right. Ian, you take care, please. Let's go. Goodbye. It's gonna be okay. This isn't goodbye. We have a pact, remember? Our Christmas wish? Now, no matter where you go, I'll be there too. It's gonna be okay, CC. You're my favorite cousin, okay? I'm always gonna look after you. I promise. Hey you. Yes, you. You deserve an upgrade. Gen Connector Worldwide helps Gen Zs and Millennials leave their backyards.

Yeah, let's go live on both sides to announce our co-venture. Yeah. No, that's perfect. I'll talk to you soon. Bonjour CC. What's happening? How are you ever gonna learn a new language if you don't practice? Why learn a new language when I have Rosetta Stone for a cousin. Spoken like a true Gen Z. Okay, but at least we didn't invent the high waist leggings, the skinny jeans, water wave lace runs and thumb up emojis. Thanks Millennials. I did not call to fuss with you today, CC. I come in peace. Get with a healthy helping of the side-eye. So, where are you in the world this week, Dora the explorer? Actually, it's Carmen, San Diego, 'cause your girl can rock a fedora and a trench coat. Thank you very much. But I'm calling to catch up on you. I'm not one of your clients. I'm not looking to see the world. Yeah, maybe not. But that doesn't mean that I can't hold you accountable for the things that you are looking to do. So how are we on your dreams of, you know, taking over the music industry. Your advice on going to college to handle the corporate music sharks is going up in smoke. I'm failing. I'm sorry. What? You're failing. Are you using the study apps I bought you? Unlike you, I can't use an app for everything in my life. CC, you gotta take action, sweetheart. Next subject. Quick vibe check though, cuz. How's the nomad life treating you? Must be nice, never staying on a place for too long, not being tied down to anything, living rent free in everyone's head but your own. You can say what you'd like CC, but I'm unfazed. Okay. So, are you coming here to the A for Christmas seeing as though you just missed Thanksgiving again? I can't. My schedule, it's just, it's crazy. You haven't been home in a long time. Our old cousin relationship is based off of calls, social media and family gatherings, all of which are always outside of Christmas. Yeah. And you know why? I moved overseas with my dad and then I went to university and then grad school and then work. I mean, CC, holiday travel, it's just a big part of my business model. So, I don't know what to tell you. That might be true, but let's just get real. And I'm grown now, so I'm just gonna say it, what everyone is thinking, including Grams. Okay. You haven't been home since your mom died. Oh my gosh. I didn't realize what time it is. CC, I gotta run, but I love you. I love you too. Ciao. I cannot believe you're here. I was in your neck of the woods. So, I just thought I'll surprise you. Okay. So you're telling me the Denmark in Seattle are now in the same neck of woods. Oh, close enough. I just wanted to catch you before you trotted the globe again. Oh, well catch me with a kiss. You know, this reminds me of that moon at night in Nairobi. We were like castaways in that hammock. And I'll never forget skinny dipping, between those cool boards. You know, that's my favorite trip to date. I told you that I to experience every lyric in Janet Jackson's runaway. And you took me to every destination. This is an aside. But my cousin CC and I quote, today, asked me if I enjoy my nomadic lifestyle? And what did you say? What's not to enjoy? I just feel like, I don't know, around every corner there's some new adventure, some beautiful city for us to experience together. You know, the definition of nomad is to live with no boundaries and no limits. It's sort of like this thing we have. You know, you keep talking like that and who knows what happens next. Well, let me show you. And that is sweeter. You know, we need to sync up our schedules again. Leave Christmas open. What are we doing for Christmas? That's a surprise. But we both know I don't like surprises. But you liked our last trip on Thanksgiving to Istanbul. Yeah. But who can say no to turkey in Turkey? True. Hey CC, what's going on? - Hey. - Wait, what's wrong? I didn't know what else to do or who else to call. Slow down. It's Grams. She had a heart attack. What? Send me the address to the hospital. Text it to me. I'm on my way. Okay. Look at them. My baby girl. Hi. Baby girl. You can hug me tighter than that. I'm not a shrinking violin, okay. That's good. Yes. Well wait a minute. Why you coming here so far? You're super busy. That is nonsense, Grams. Thank you. Hi, Doc. Deja Ford. I'm Mrs. Thomas' granddaughter. It's nice to meet you. Well, as I told you grandmother, she suffered a coronary artery spasm, sometimes called a silent heart attack. She's very lucky. Oh, I'm blessed. Yes Lord, I'm blessed. There's no permanent damage. But she doesn't make some lifestyle changes, her health is gonna worsen. Now, in the next few days, we're gonna transfer her to a rehab facility. Oh no. The hell you preach now. No facility for me. Grams. I'm going home. Grams. Christmas is only a month away. Our priority is to get you more Christmases than just this one. Is at home rehab an option? Yes, but it takes discipline. Well that's what she wants to do, and that's what's gonna happen. Thank you, baby girl. All right. I can see that you're in good hands here. I'll be back. Thank you. I missed you. No, I missed you more. Deja, can I talk to you for a second? Yep. Okay. I'll be right back. Okay. Ooh, I love you baby. That's good. - I love you. - I love you more. Yes, I'm going home. That's right. I feel better already. Home, is that really the best idea? I mean, rehabs have pros trained for this stuff. I don't want her to get any worse. CC, she won't. Yeah, I'm gonna get Grams back on her feet. Ever since my parents ghosted me, straight dumped me on Grams, she's been my everything. I know. Do you, 'cause your mom was always there. Even after she died, your dad wanted you to be with him. Both of my parents are alive and neither of them came back for me. You and Grams are all I've got. I just, I can't. Do this, work, the school, Christmas and care taking? Hey, hey, hey. I got it. I'm gonna stay a few weeks to get everything set up. I'm gonna hire a caretaker, the whole nine. I want you to focus on school. All right. She's gonna be fine. Watch your step. Okay. All right, Oh, home sweet home. Ooh. Oh, what about my bag? It's all right, Grams. I'll grab it. Okay, hold on. Let me do this, here. All right. I wanna show you something. Yeah. Yeah. Grams never changed your room. She always hoped that you'd visit. So, she kept it as you'd remember it. Hey babe. Wait. Hold on. You gotta see this. Wow. That really is your childhood room. Yeah, it's exactly how I left it. Nice. I'm glad you're home. Yeah, me too. I did have to postpone a bunch of my events in all my travel until the new year. Of course. Family first. Yeah. I just wish my clients felt the same way. You should see these emails I'm getting. People are up in arms about me just having to postpone things, which is insane. Your reputation is everything, Deja. Smooth things over with those clients fast. Remember your motto. Yeah, I know. Action speaks louder than the words. Hey Grams. Here are your meds. I made you some calming tea. It should help you sleep. Stop making a fuss over me, okay. I'm DJing tonight at the spin. You should come. It'll be like old times. Really. Old times for you. So funny. Yeah. Oh, you're really inviting me. Girl. I hung up my skate so long ago. You? Not skating? You were born to be on wheels. Shoot, you can skate before you could even walk. Yeah, Well Grams, some things are better left as memories so they can fade. And then, I can't leave you here by yourself. Oh, Ms. Charlene up the street can come and sit with me for a spell. So, go on out. It's Saturday. Have some fun. You heard the lady. Let's get into these streets. She had a long day. I don't know. Take your meds. Okay, I will, Go on. It's about to go down. Uh, uh. Not gonna happen. Damn, touchy. You look so cute. You gonna turn me out or something? What? It's meat marking on wheels in here. Girl, you better recognize. Word of warning by the way, you're rolling with the youngin tonight. So don't be coming up in here cramping on my style. Please and thank you. And the lockers are back there, so you can go grab your skates. Oh, no. I'm just chilling tonight. Okay. Well my set's about to start. So you can stay here and keep the wall company. Hey, shout out up to my cousin Deja, back in the Spin. See you girl. No way. Ms. Deja Ford, as I live and breathe. Are you real or is this though figment of my imagination? Depends on who's asking. It's been a minute since I've seen you. 15 Years, it's a long minute. Social media. Yeah, social media and in person are too variables. You're still funny. Oh, I'm sorry. I heard about your Grams. Yeah, that is why I'm here. Roll call. Oh, oh. Yes sir. Does she always do that? She's always lit. But that's actually my cue. Please, don't go anywhere. Will you? You still got that black point shoe. What? You thought? I'm gonna lose it? Look, I wanna show you something. Okay. It's over there. There it is. Whoa. How cute were we? So, Oh my gosh. I need to get a picture of this. Get a picture of everything. Get in. So, does RIC still have the dopest holiday party? Not like it used to be back when your mom, yeah. It's all right. No one could carry her mantle. The way she would volunteer, teaching us neighborhood kids how to skate for free while holding down a full-time job as a social worker? Forget about it. They broke the mold when they made her. Yeah, they did. You know what? You actually look like her. Really? You don't think so? No. Well, I think the resemblance is uncanny and beautiful. I should probably go check on CC. Okay. Well, I just hope it's not another 15 years before I see you again. It's really good to see you, Ian. You as well. How are things with you? I went to the Spin tonight. What's the Spin? It's the Spin not a Spin. I told you about this place. No, you didn't. I would remember that. Really? I guess I didn't. Yeah, you don't talk much about Atlanta. Well the Spin, it's a roller skating rink. No, no, no. It's actually more than that. The Spin's an institution. An institution. Well, color me intrigued. Okay. So I grew up going to the Spin. It was like a neighborhood hangout. I used to skate there all the time. Hold up. You skate? I can't imagine you trading in your red bottoms for wheels. Yeah. No, that was another lifetime. Well, when you come back to the future, remember to smooth things over with those clients of yours about those postponed events. That is on deck for tomorrow. And hey, thank you for just, you know, always making sure I'm on point and caring about my dreams. Well, that's what power couples do, baby. We look out for each other. I always got your back. Good night, Deja. Okay, here we go. What's that? Cue cards, since you won't let me get you a smartphone. Oh no, I don't want a smartphone. I like my dumb phone. I don't want a phone smarter than me. I'm smart enough. Okay, moving on. So, I came up with this three step plan. First, therapy, nutrition, recovery. You're missing the fourth plan. What about Christmas? Grams, we will dive into Christmas once we finish the three step plan. So first things first, rehab techs, PT and OT, they're gonna train you every day. Oh, I don't know about all that. It's that or a rehab clinic. I'll take door number one. That's what I thought. So, medical alert. And I'm gonna put some cameras around the house. That way I can see you on my iPhone anytime I'm anywhere. Uh-uh. I don't need cameras all around this house watching me 24/7. I ain't on "Big Brother". The only eyes I want watching me are God. Are you gonna help here? We're getting you a caretaker. Oh, wait. You acting like I'm an invalid. Come on Grams, it'll be fun. Having someone wait on your hand and foot. Like, that's dope. I ain't no real housewives, B-ball, loving hip-hop hussy. I don't need nobody at my beck and call. Well, I'm not a Miss Cleo. And I see all of this in your future. Who's Miss Cleo? Oh, Lord. Wait, seriously? I don't know them. Grams, I know that it seems like I'm being bossy, but this is the only way I know how to take care of you. Uh-uh. That's too many people in this house. What? This is necessary. Ian's in the house you. - Yo, yo, yo. - Hi. That set last night was great. Ooh, thank you. I've been working on the sounds. Well guess what? I'm so glad you're doing okay. Give me one of them hugs? I'm so glad you're okay. I'm glad to see you. Yes ma'am. And just in the nick a time. Yeah, well you just like the good Lord, may not come when you want him but he always be right there on time. And now that the drill Sergeant Deja is done, it's Christmas checklist time. Oh. So you know me, my yearly assist. I usually come help and take the decorations out of the attic. How did I not know this? What's that look? Oh, and I brought java 'cause today is sponsored by yeah, coffee. Thank you. And we got one for you. I need that. Yeah, thank you. And I got your favorite, I think it was holiday cocoa with peppermint. You remembered. Of course. It's only been 15 years. But I haven't had this since I left. I'm a tea drinker now so, But I guess went in Rome, - Drink the coffee. - Yes, when in the hood. Same difference. Wow. That is so good. That's actually exactly how I remembered it. Thank you. Don't mention it. So, you always come bearing gifts. Of course. Oh Deja, you know that Ian is like a fixture in this home. Yeah. Like Bud on the "Cosby Show". I'll take that. Or Hakeem on "Moesha". Better yet, Urkel on "Family Matters". You can't give me Stefan? You wanna give me Urkel. That's crazy. Well y'all enjoy your drinks. I gotta get to work. All right. I can help you if like that wouldn't be imposition? I don't mind. But you gotta work. My middle name is work. You know what's crazy? What if this room used to be off limits when we were kids. And you act like that stopped us from sneaking up there a few times. Yeah, and getting in punishment that seemed like a lasted for an eternity. Well, I'd rather punishment than spankings from Grams. She was like a WWE wrestler with that. Hey Ian, just quickly. I feel like I owe you an apology. It's my fault that we didn't stay in touch like we should have, like we promised. That's okay. We travel, we get busy, I get it. It's just like me and dad, we were just always going from place to place and time just kind of slipped away and then, I don't know. We're here now. Here we are. How is your dad? Oh, same. He's laser focused on the mission at hand. It's just like growing up, I appreciated how hard he worked, you know. He sacrificed a lot for me going from base to base just to make ends meet. But as I've gotten older, our schedules are so busy that I just, I haven't actually spent a Christmas with him in years. Sorry to hear that. No, me too. Anyway. Hey Christmas storage 101. You post a lot don't you? I mean it's kind of the nature of my job. You don't post it, it didn't happen. Speaking of your company, your Global Gen, I see it's taking off. Yeah. No, it was actually supposed to just be a blog. Me telling people about my experience as an army expat daughter. But after university it just like really took off. How about you, like Mr. Accountant? Well, it looks like our fathers are influence in both of us. After I graduated family, like my dad, I joined his accountant firm. I just never saw that for you, you know. Crunching numbers for a living. I guess you're what Clark Kent by day and Superman in the skates by night. Good one. My social media page. Yeah. And I actually made that a while back. It has a steady following. I don't really post much. Steady following? It has 200,000 followers. It's more than a steady following. It's a future career. It's more of a pass time for me. I look at it like my poster for the culture, not the creator. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I forgot. He's supposed to be doing this. I have a soundtrack. It's gonna work too. I actually haven't heard this song forever. ♪ We got chemistry, you and me ♪ We survived ♪ We survived Wow, it must have been amazing to be able to travel, to sew different skating rinks. Actually, I haven't done that. I don't skate anymore. I don't believe that for a second. You're serious. Why don't you skate anymore? You love skating. I grew up Ian. Grew up. I get it. Growing up means giving up something that makes you happy. Hey you. Yep, before you mention anything, I just finished reaching out to some clients. So, we are almost all good on that front. Brilliant. And also freeze the comment section on your website. A troll can't troll if there's nowhere to troll. That's actually a really good idea. Thank you. What did I need to deserve for you? Well, I'll show you next time we see each other. By the way, who is that chap you've been spending time with? What guy? Oh, Ian. We were friends growing up. Well you seem pretty friendly now too. I mean, yeah. You know what I mean though. Like we were kids, we were buddies. Did you read the caption? It was in there. He was my partner growing up when we skated. My mom taught us how to skate. At this Spin place, I presume. Yeah, the Spin. Well, you have lots of fun, my dear. Au revoir. Au revoir. Okay. Son, you have a visitor. How'd you find me? You know I have my ways. I don't wanna hear about all that. A real question is, where have you been? We were supposed to post more skate videos today. You know, I hate when you do that. Ask me how I'm doing or something not interrogating me soon as you, Okay. Okay. Oh, baby. And I'm still waiting on an answer. No, we couldn't tik or tok today. I had to help Miss Mattie. Your old lady charity case? I'm just, That's not funny. A geeky. That's not funny. No, seriously. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But if you really wanna help her, we gotta get our weight up. You know, we can be the Bay of Jay of skate thing. Yeah, that's true. And that's big talk for someone who's always in and out of my life. Why you tripping? Really? - I'm not tripping. - You gonna call me out? I'm here. All I'm saying is we could really corner the market on this skate thing 'cause nobody's on what we do in the social media space. You know we can do this together. See, I do love that about you. You always got your eyes on the prize. You just drive me nuts. What's the plan? We gotta feed the beast. We gotta post more videos, more skate content. You gotta help get my page blue check verified like yours and together we're unstoppable. That's true. It's just only one problem with that. Yeah. One moment you say we're together the next minute or not. Because I'm not into labels, but I'm into you and I'm here right now. My mom's. Yeah. Well, let's go to your house. All right. But right now, we have mom's house. Come on. How you think she got your daddy? You look at all these tangled up lights. Did you tangle up these lights? I think Ian might, all the work you guys have doing around here, for a reason to come back? Yeah. Well, I think they sit down in the box and tangle themselves up on you. This sure bring back memories. All the Christmas traditions me and Gramps started before he died. I can imagine. Including skating at the Spin. When me and Grams got together, Black folks couldn't go to the ice skating rinks around here. But we had the Spin. I never knew that. It didn't have ice, but on that floor we were skating on clouds. Okay. So, what's next on the checklist? Well, picking out a Christmas tree. Usually in helps me 'cause he has a pickup truck. You can go with. Are you insinuating something here. What you feel like? No comments. I plead the fifth. Well I guess that's enough for me tonight. You're leaving me in the middle of this. I am. I'm gonna go to my room 'cause my story's about to come on and you think about that for me. Good night, Grams. Good night, aby girl. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Christmas tree in the house. Woo. Go Christmas. Go Christmas. - Go tree. - Go tree. Go, go. Oh, Deja them flowers came from you, from your UK babe. Did you match the tree? Yes ma'am. 'Cause last time you let CC do it, the tree was scraping all over the ceiling. Oh, yeah. Your UK babe sent the sweetest note with them flowers. I'm sorry. You read the note? It said, "Like these flowers, my heart is blooming for you." He got that "Bridgerton" game. Now, you gave it a good shake, before you brought it in the house, right? Yes ma'am. Okay. 'Cause these things is messy. And I done had this carpet since 70s. Your husband laid it with his bare hands. Well that's right. God rest his soul. Hey Ian, that's loose. It's fine. I do this every year. I keep imagining your man reciting these words like Idris Elba. I love me brother with an accent. If you would just let me help. - I go it. - It's gonna fall. - I tell you, I got it. - Oh. Oh, my goodness. Come on, Ian. Come on, baby girl. Come on now. I know you meant to fall on him. That's all right. All right. Come on. Y'all okay? I mean, other than the fact that I got pine needles all over. And so, do you. You got the whole tree in your sweatshirt. Man, you got it all hair. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. They should put something under the tree. Yes ma'am. I'll get it right now. Aha. Thanks for the help, CC. Oh. That was eventful. Yeah. - Thank you. - Oh, thanks Ian. Thanks Ian. No problem. I leave you ladies to it so I can get some of these pines off my behind. So, Deja. Yeah. The flowers are beautiful sweetheart. And the two of you all have been an item for some years. Grams, I know where you're headed with this. Oh. Pierce and I, our relationship is fine just as it is. Really? I thought y'all was dating out of convenience. You know what CC? This whole nomad dating thing that you say I'm doing, it's actually amazing. It's something like a storybook romance novel. Oh, that's great. That's great, Deja. Just make sure the two of you are more than just two ships passing in the night. We are Grams. What we have his actually easy. Easy is not always good. Keep this in mind. If you really love someone or something, it's worth the work. Okay? Yeah, okay. I forgot to tell you, those flowers, was really nice. Your boy is a real class. Thank you. First off, he's not my boy. He's my man. And what are you? Trying to keep tabs on me? No, no, no, no, no. It doesn't take a deep faith to know that you have a jet setting executive boyfriend. You post him a lot. Okay. Well how's your love life? No comment. Grams said to me, that if you love something it takes hard work. And I used to love skating. So, figured I give it a try again. Well that's nice. Just make sure you don't try to keep up with me. No, seriously. - Okay. - No, seriously. I want you to find your rhythm. I have rhythm. But can you ride the beat? I feel like this is a trick question. Not at all. Because in the A, we don't skate, we ride. So, that being said, I just need for you to relax. Riding is about letting go. So, let's go. I forgot how much fun that was. Reminds me of my mom in the best way. Well, I'm happy you had fun. Oh, so the million dollar question. Yeah. Are you ready to take your rebooted skating skills for a spin at the Spin for grown folks now? Sure, why not? Hey you. How are you? Another day, another country. On my way to another five star hotel. I'm in Paris. Please don't tell me it's our favorite by the Champs-Elysees. Nope. Guess again. The auberge, the one in walking distance from the Louvre. Oui, oui. Hey, sorry I missed your call earlier. You didn't leave a voicemail and once I saw it you were on a flight already. Yeah, it's been hard to tie you down the last few days. Yeah, I know. It's been pretty busy here actually. Too busy for me. Never. Hey. It's time to, hey, it's time to leave for the Spin. I'm the first set so I can't be late. Okay, gimme one second. Okay. Hey babe. Sorry. I actually have to go. Let me guess. You're going to the Spin. Yeah. You know it's crazy how much, I forgot how much I loved skating, you know. It just kind of gives me that same freedom as nomad living. I really cannot wait to share this with you. Maybe we can, you know, take a skate around the Trocadero Gardens. With the Eiffel Tower as our backdrop. Okay babe. Bonswa. Bonswa. I'm coming. Okay, so I know that I said I was ready but I don't think that I am. Reminds me when we were kids. It feels like forever and yet, like yesterday. Like yesterday. Deja, this is Leilani. You haven't had a chance to meet her yet. I'm his woman. Wait, what? That's not what you said though. Mind if I cut in. Be my guest. Deja. Who is she to you? Don't lie to me 'cause I seen her tagging you in her posts. It's just a post. She's an old friend. You gotta stop that jealous stuff. Come on. - Who's jealous. - Yeah. Of what. I'm shipping you two so hard right now. I'm not letting up. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter because he's with her and I'm with Pierce. Oh. And all is right in the world. Wait, rewind. Why do you care? I thought you had a storybook romance. I stand by my statement, okay. I have traveled the world. I've seen the seven wonders. And although this skating thing has been cute, I still don't get the same joy I did as a kid. Look, all I know about life may come from memes and GIFs, it may, but that kind of joy that you're searching for, that's the inside job. No man can give you that. Really, Deja? Really? Action speaks louder than words. Okay. Do you have that information I wanted on the Spin. Yeah, would you send it over for me right now, please? Thank you. Oh, you're right. That is interesting. The Spin is behind on their mortgage payments. I think I can use that. Can you connect me to the Spins bank please? And hold my calls for the next few hours. Hello. Mr. Lee. I'm LP. Right now, the bank has updated you, right? Yeah, but but I'm still a bit confused. Well, let me paint the picture for you. Your business has been underwater for quite some time now and your assets are worth less than the outstanding mortgage. Yeah, but the bank knows I'm good for it. The bank hasn't taken action for fear of a short sell. They will not accept anything less than what's owed on the mortgage, which is why you are still in business. Yeah, I know. However, That is where I come in. My firm has agreed to pay the balance of the mortgage with a 10% uptick. So, you'll all make a profit. But what would happen to the Spin? We're gonna tear it down. It's great land development opportunity. Condos, online warehouses, sky's the limit rink. And what if I don't a agree to the sale? Well the bank already has you in free foreclosure. So, if you don't pay the mortgage first business day after Christmas, we're gonna shut you down. How's rehab going? The physical therapist tried to put me in a downward face. And, oh, hell no. Well I'm glad you're least swinging medical away. Might as well have on an ankle monitor. Feel like I'm on house arrest. Okay, well I haven't heard you say anything about the nanny cams 'cause I put those up. They're small, aren't they? Oh, if these cameras catch me in any uncompromising position and I land on OnlyFans, I'm blaming you. You gotta stop listening to CC. It's that for your health. That's my girl. Oh, look at the kitty cat go again. Hey, hey. There he is. My official taste tester. Ian still finger licks the bowl, Deja, just like he did when you all were kids. Ah, ah, you ain't licking nothing over here this year Ian. We don't know where your tongue been. CC. I'm just playing with him. So Ian, how's things with you and Leilani? Oh, we still making skate videos. Okay. Skrrt skrrt, to the good part. There is no good part. We skate together to make each other better. What? I mean, we've had good times and bad times at the rinks, but we're just in a point in our relationship where taking off labels is a new norm. Hear that Deja? Sounds cas' to me. Hello. Wait, what? Y'all not gonna believe this is. Is everything okay? So, that's the gist of it. If I can't pay the mortgage by the first, and the Spin will shut down for good. - What? - What? There's always something, always something. That's all I have. I'll keep you all posted. Thank you. We need to talk too. Come on. Deja, Deja. What up? I've just been sitting here working on this virtual presentation for my sponsors. It's basically revenue projections for the next year. That is actually not why I texted you. Oh, of course. I can't stop thinking about the Spin. Me either. My mom's gone, right, but I don't wanna lose her traditions too. We gotta do something about it. What you thinking? Well, what if we turn, the Rolling into Christmas ball into a fundraiser? I know. I'm a genius. Let me hear it. I was gonna say it but now I'm not. Ian. Ian, this is beautiful. Thank you. I try. So look, you really want to help save the Spin? - Aha. - I know where to start. Tell me what you're thinking. You're gonna love the office. Wow. Here we are. Ian, what? This is incredible. Yep. This is my man cave. One day I'm gonna turn it into a skate cave. I'm actually mind blown. Oh, check you out. Are these your favorites pants or something. They're actually my lucky pants. It's not funny. Look. Look first place, I won these lucky pants. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I think you need a new pair of pants. Enough about the pants. Let's talk business. So, at one point I was toying with the idea of taking Skate-N-Flex from a social media page and making into an app for all things roller skating, like celebrity branded merch, dating, you know, pretty much the essentials. That's actually a really dope idea. But that idea only gave me a bunch of sleepless nights and dead end. So, I have to pump the brakes for that. You need to pick it back up. You've created the whole brand for it. Just connect the dots. Yeah. That's easier said than done. But let me show you how this ties into the fundraiser. So, we take Skate-N-Flex and make it the voice for the RIC. 200,000 followers is a great place to build from. And, already made a mock up. Contacted the Spin skates and neighbors, everyone's willing to help. We just gotta pull the trigger. I think the only thing we're missing is a face to the cause. That's true. We need to go to the skaters at the rink and figure out how to get testimonials from them. That way people have actually a vested interest in what we're doing. Huh. Like a human interest story. Yeah, basically. That's a really good idea. How about we doing tonight? The skaters will be there. Oh, that's perfect. I never go anywhere without my camera set up, so. This is starting to feel like one of our old capers. Hopefully we don't end up in punishment. You know, all things don't have to come to an end. I hope not. Hey Grams, the person I was looking for. You told me to call you when Deja wasn't here. Yes ma'am. I'm working on a surprise for Deja and I need your help. I'm all in. Write it down for me. Salute. Check it out. It's pretty good. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I think we're actually gonna make some headway on those donations. Yeah. Yeah. Why do we have to come to this uppity holiday party? Most of the folks, you have a stick stuck up, Little girl, act like you had some home training. I love these traditions though. Writing a wish on the paper and throwing it in the fire. That's so nice. My wish this year is at the food doesn't suck. My wish wasn't great. That's nasty. They're invited to the cookouts. Oh, my God. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah. Hurricane Leilani coming through. Prepare for impact. Don't worry, I got this. Lani. So, I guess my invitation got lost in the mail. I already told you, the guest list was limited. Why is Ian standing there like they're a throuple or something. What's a throuple? Nothing. Childhood buddies can make the list. Or are you cuddy buddies? - Excuse me. - What? I'm just trying to get a lay of the land. Check out the sleeping arrangements. There's no sleeping going on here. She better not touch Deja, 'cause I got time today. I'll take out these lashes and these earrings and I will beat her, Ah, ah. Really? Really? At the brunch, really? You're done drinking. I need talked to you outside. Come on. Her name anyway? Lasagna? Grams. Lani, my parents brunch? What are you trying to prove? I want what's mine. I put time into us. I've been fighting for this for our dream. Even when you put your little accounting job in front of our skating careers, I kept pushing. Kept pushing? You're the one that set the parameters in our relationship. Real talk, you wasn't even checking for me before Deja showed up. Oh. Well, if that's the case, that damn sure didn't stop your little late night phone calls. Yo Lani, scoot over. Let me come through. I can slide up in there like I do on my skates. I know how you like it. Yo, you tripping. We're supposed to be going our social media careers, but your is too busy skating down memory lane with little Miss Travelocity in there. Lani, you know what you do to me? You get in my head like nobody else. And you do that all the time. Takes one to no one. You're the only guy I've let my guard down for. I don't believe that. You got me open out here. So tell me, where do we go from here, huh? Hold that thought. I gotta go make things right. You gotta go get my jacket. I'll call you. I would like to apologize about earlier, like Lani was outta hand. Don't sweat it. I kind of swooped in out of nowhere. I recognize we probably sent some mixed signals. They weren't mixed to me. Ian, like we're friends, right? We're here to save the Spin and make this the best Christmas ever. Right? Save the Spin. For the record, me and Leilani aren't together. Come on guys. You already know what time it is. Skating is like oxygen to me. So, #SaveTheSpin. Skating at Christmas at the Spin is life. We gotta save the Spin. We can't let it go away. Save the Spin. I love the Spin. Y'all cannot let it close. Come on. We need all y'all's donations. #SaveTheSpin. What is this called? It's a non-tree Christmas tree. We used to do it at the base all the time. Card. What was Christmas like over there? Very different from here. It was typically just me and dad. Nice. It was kind of cool though, being in other countries and seeing how they do Christmas. Like in Venezuela, they shut down the streets and everybody just roller skates to Christmas mass. Now that had to be amazing to see. Yeah, it kind of was. Looking back, I actually wish I would've participated, but guess that's just another one of my many regrets. Hey, hey, hey. I'm about to stir up some memories. - Yo. - Oh my gosh. No way. How do you still have our old stockings? Nah, still there. What? The messages we used to give each other. That's precious. I think y'all know what to do with those. I'm going to get some eggnog. Yes ma'am. These are from that last holiday. For your eyes only. That means me. Ian, I want to laugh, sing, skated, dream, and most of all I want to find my way home back to all of you. Oh. Sweet. I wrote that the night that I left with dad. Nice. Okay. Yours. Deja, I just wanna be where you are. I was never a man of many words. It also looks like you tried to draw a picture of us skating, holding hands. I was never Picasso either, but I would always try my hardest for you. Let's go get the eggnog. Grandma. Thank you so much. Yo. Why the frown. The virtual presentation that I pulled together for my sponsors just didn't go over well. I should have listened to Pierce and been there face to face. And then I saw this. We are a week away from our RIC and nowhere near our goal. Why the frown. EzzRahh's manager won't give him my tape. What? He said he wasn't felling it. I know. If I can get to EzzRahh myself, he would know that my music is dope. That's messed up. I feel like we're doing all this work and we're back at the starting block. It's frustrating. Wait. We are tripping, that's it. We just need to get back to the basics. My mom ran this place on a shoestring budget. - Yeah, - Right? - She did. - Sure. So we're sitting here trying to reinvent the wheel when all we need to do is throw a, - Skatathon. - Correct. I can reach out to the local businesses to see if they can sponsor the skaters that perform. And the skaters can wear the swag like rolling billboards. That's genius. What about me? You know what? I think honestly, what you need to do is you need to DJ a live stream until the Skatathon. Feature all the skaters that are gonna perform that night. That's a good idea. And then, we can tie the live streams in with Skate-N-Flex social media page. And connect it to Jen Connector's holiday masses. Oh, Yay. You know what? We'll even tag EzzRahh. And if this doesn't get his attention, I don't know. Well, speaking of back to the basics, Deja, you should do the same for your blog. What do you mean? You should do a testimonial on coming home for the holidays. Open up to your audience. Talk about why you're back and why it took you so long to come back. Keep it real. That's good. You might be on to something, sir. I might be on to something. We got this though, don't we all y'all? All right. We gotta get to work then. You are obsessed with saving that rink. You know there's other rinks in the town, newer, larger, better rinks. But they're not to Spin. You act like your heart belongs to that rink or is it to that girl? Why are we doing this? So many times I thought we could be something if we stop with the games. Don't you want something real? Baby, this is real. I read your new blog entry you posted last night. It's fantastic. Reminded me of your earlier one. Thank you. And also thank you for your sizable donation to the fundraiser. Anything for you. You know your trip rubbed off on me. For Christmas, I'll be going to Switzerland. My parents are going. It's gonna be a perfect family holiday. That's awesome. I can't wait to see you in the New Year. I'll be counting the days. Hey, what's up? What's up? What's up guys? It's your girl CC. You already know the RIC is going down on Christmas Eve. Now today's feature skater is our girl Zel. Ooh, she got the move. She got the moves. Now she's sponsored by Omega Tires. But don't worry, it's a lot more where that came from, okay. Just make sure you click the link in our bio and support the local businesses. We gonna #SaveTheSpin together. How are you so good at this? - Thank you. - Thank so very much. You were awesome. Yo. Yo. Come on, CC. We need to talk. I think we talked enough at the brunch, Leilani. Here's the deal. I checked out your blog and saw that you have a dude, Pierce? Cute. Leave Ian alone or I will contact him by any means necessary and tell him about your little holiday whore affair. There's nothing going on with me and Ian. So, I don't know what you'd be telling him. I said what I said. You got me? On sight. Move. Hey darling. Spiked hot chocolate. So glad you came by. Yes, I made some hot chocolate and I put a little kick to it. A little kick? Yeah, it's got that Kung-fu. Oh, you like it? Oh, I love it. What's good though? That brunch is the talk of the season. Can't say I'm sorry enough. I feel sorry. You let everything get in the way of your passion, your fears, the safety of your job, that Leilani. But you know what? This season, I saw a glim of hope. Ever since Deja came back, it's like you have been reenergized in a way that I haven't seen since your childhood. It's like you came outta hibernation. Mom, that sentiment is best for sonnets and love songs. It's not that serious. You joke, but second chances don't come around often. So you're saying I'm just supposed to unpack all of these feelings onto Deja. What do you do? Keep them bottled up inside? She just wants to keep things on a friendship tip. So, I don't wanna force anything. Son, do you love her? Because if you do, then you need to tell her you do. Listen, Christmas comes around each and every single year but real love that only comes once in a lifetime. What you gonna do? I really enjoyed your help this year. Of course. But I actually need to talk to you about something. Okay, wait. Can I go first? Sure. So I just wanted to say thank you for encouraging me to do my blog testimonial. I mean, people absolutely loved it. It's kind of served as a connection between me and my followers and my clients. My sales are insane right now. I always felt like I had to show this persona of like a person that had it all figured out, but who knew that letting go would actually be the real gift, you know? Could we say sit? Yeah. Okay. So I got you something. What? Consider it an early Christmas gift. Get your phone. I'll Air Drop it. I know how much you love apps. So, I got you an app that'll help you laugh, the one that'll help you dance, the one that'll to help you skate, one that'll help you dream. So all the things I said I wanted in that note, that last holiday. I wanna be your home, Deja. I don't ever wanna lose you again. Sorry. It's just a lot to process. Ask yourself this. Have you felt whole or have you felt like something has been missing? That's not the point. Only point that matters. When I was a kid, I always thought you would come back. But when you didn't, I moved on and I thought I grew out of my feelings for you until you showed up and it all came flooding back. Skating wasn't my first love. You were my first love, Deja. I got into skating because of you. I really wasn't expecting this. Neither was I. But I know you'll be gone after Christmas. So, if I didn't tell you now, I would regret it forever. Deja Ford, I loved you then and I love you now. Say something. Ian, I care about you too, but I can't do this. Like, we can't just blow up our lives based off nostalgia. It's not that simple. I just need time. Okay. What CC? What happened here? Ian found out his chick was using him. What? Yeah. My girl, Tia gave me all the Lipton brewed, fresh piping, hot. CC, English please. Ian is getting played. Tia can't stand Leilani. She's a bad influence on her sister. Girl, they be scheming on men, hitting licks up on Cash App. Just thirst trapping, honestly. What are you talking about, CC? Leilani is a bopper. She's using Ian for the views and for the likes. It's simple hustle now. Just hold on a second. Leilani's social media has 85K followers due to Ian promoting her page on Skate-N-Flex. Now as soon as she hits 100K, she'll be at the threshold for ad sales, brand ambassadorships, et. cetera. So, you're telling me that as soon as she reaches that she's, She'll. tell Ian to kick rocks. That's low. Do you really have proof of this? When you come to my register, I always have receipts. Tia's sister left the room for a sec. So, her phone was open and unlocked and we screen shotted the text thread. And girl, Leilani spilled tea, called Ian a simp and other words. I'm not gonna say this close to Jesus' birthday. See? Leilani says she'll dump Ian as soon as she hits 100K followers. You gotta tell him. We can't let our boy go out like that. So, let me get this straight. I lay my heart on the line for you yesterday and you tell me no. Ian, I didn't say no. But you didn't say yes. And then, you come here telling me that Leilani's using me. Okay. I recognize how this might sound. Like you got me twisted. Yeah. How about you take more time nourishing your fake relationship with Pierce and less time trashing Leilani. That's what you can do. I'm sorry, my fake relationship? It's all on your social media page. Yeah. The only time you're with him is for his business trips and vacations. Am I lying? Everybody knows you're scared to be in one place with one person. Stop playing yourself. You know what? What? - Check your phone. - For what? You're not the only person that can send Air Drops. What is this? Those are the messages between Leilani and her homegirl. So, you can actually see what she's saying about you. What? What? Ian, I didn't come over here. No, I'm good. Thank you. Wow. I screwed everything up. Yeah, cuz. You dragged in for filth. Read the room, CC. What? When I was little, you and Ian were inseparable. Like tight, tight. Yes. And seeing y'all this holiday, it just clicked for me. You two are real relationship goals, then and now. You have to decide who you're gonna share your soul with. See, the heart may lie, but the soul never does. You hear me? That was beautiful Grams. What you two done to me this holiday? Got me drinking up all my feelings. What are you doing? I'm deleting all my dating naps and cleaning out my DMs. I'm gonna give it a try and settle down with one person once I find them. You will. I could. The right guy is out there for both of you. I promise. Just don't pick the same guy. Thanks Grams. All right. Woo. I'm feeling good. That's my pretty little princess. Oh, well. All grown up. Tonight's the night, the RIC. How you feel? Nervous. Well, no matter how things go, I want you to know that your mom is proud of you and so am I. And I want to thank you for everything you've done for me. The doctor says I'm on the road to recovery. Yeah. And I want you to know, I hate to admit it, but hiring a caretaker full time after the holiday is a good idea. I have good news. The music producer, EzzRahh, caught our live and he loves my music. Woo. He wants to offer me a paid internship. Congratulations, baby. Oh, CC, it's so awesome. Thank you. Well ladies, it's to go. Whereas CC says, let's get in them streets. How you doing? Very good. Like ooh, ooh. You guys are going crazy. Oh, you better show her girl. Hey, what's up? What's up? It's your girl CC, coming live from the RIC. And you already know what time it guys. Tonight, is the big night, Skatathon. Businesses pledged to donate money to help #SaveTheSpin. So, I'm gonna need two things from everybody, I'm gonna need you to keep skating and keep donating. Let's the party going. Hey, Mr. Lee. How are we doing? It was a valiant effort, but we're 60% of our goal. That's a long way to go. We're just gonna keep on pushing then. - Thank you. - Yeah. Deja Ford, your presence is needed at the DJ booth. Hi. Hi. This is for you. Thank you. Well, I had a really long layover before I go to Switzerland, so thought I'd surprise you. I remember you saying CC was the DJ and I know Grams is around us somewhere, so. But first, another surprise. We're both going to Switzerland, AM tomorrow. It's all booked. Babe, this is just my first Christmas back. You know you've already been here for four weeks. Isn't that long enough? LP, what are you doing here? The deadline isn't here yet and I've still got time to raise more money. Oh no, no. Mr. Lee, I'm sorry. This is not LP. This is my boyfriend. Yeah. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Pierce. Nah. I just heard your voice on the sound system and we've talked a few times. I think that's the British accent. Deja, this is the man who's trying to tear down the Spin. Actually, I think you might be confused. I still got his voicemail message on my phone. Here. This is LP. Just touching base. The team's ready to break ground on the Spin for those condos we talked about. Now let me explain now, I am not a bad guy. You already know that. But you've made me a desperate man over the last few weeks. Please explain. I thought I was losing you to Ian. I've seen to both you online. Nothing is happening. Maybe not physically, but you can't tell me it's not emotionally. So, let me get this right here. You are going to destroy a part of my community, my past, over an assumption. This is your past Deja. I am your future. Now, you've already been here four weeks. Isn't that long enough? I'll do anything for you, Deja. Anything. Remember your motto, "Action speaks louder than words." Yeah, you know what? In your actions, Pierce, they're sick. You're sick. The offer still stats, okay. Swiss Alps. It's too late for this Spin anyway. Train's already left the station. How's this for actions, Pierce? Get out. Pierce, get out. Mr. Lee. I am so sorry. Yeah, can I get a size 14. Oh, look at you. Good to see you. Mama, Oh, my goodness. - How are you. - Oh, I'm great. - How are you? - Good to see you. Yeah. - You look good. - You do too, baby. I'm not sure if you should be here skating this early. Oh, look, look. All I need is a couple of rounds, with you holding me up. Young general. Hey, man. Thank you. You know what time it is. Good looking out. Look at you. Where's my baby girl? Oh, look at that. Right there Hum, hum. Daddy. Did you see that? What are you doing here? I'm here to see you. But how did you know, I'd be the rink, Grams? Well, your young general let me know. You did a good job. It's good to see you. You too. Listen, I know I ain't been around for a lot of holidays, but I see some great news for you. I got eight months of service left. After that, I'll be right here with you and family for good, for good, good. - Really? - Really. All right. Yes. That's it. They hit the goal. ♪ Merry Christmas baby ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Baby Thought I taught you better than that, son. It's never over. What do you mean? It's over. Sorry, we're late, son. But your father has been on the phone the entire night with his partners trying to get them on board for this fundraiser. You have. It's been my mission since the brunch. And we wanted to keep it on the hush hush because we didn't want you to get your hopes up. Well, the partners finally caved in tonight, so we pushed right over here. Mr. Lee, how much is needed to hit the goal? It's pretty, Consider it done? Our firm will take care of it. It's tax write off anyway, right? There is absolutely nothing that we wouldn't do to help you to realize your dream. Now it's time for you to live that dream, son. We love you. Everybody, we saved the Spin. So, you skating couples? Nope. Solo. Where is Leilani? Anywhere but here. You were right. She used me. CC posted Leilani's intent all on social media. So, I'd like to apologize. I accept the apology. But what I really came to say was, thank you for inviting my dad here. It was pretty awesome. It's all good. So, the guy you were talking to earlier that was, Pierce, my fake boyfriend? Yeah. Where is he? Right now, I'm pretty sure he's in an Uber headed to the airport or hell.. He turned out to be like a pretty crappy guy. He actually asked me to go to Switzerland with him and I told him I had better plans. Care to skate? Isn't that what we always promise ourselves. To always hold onto each other. And never let go. You want try our old routine? I don't really remember it. What? Yeah, but see, here's the thing. My question is, who leads? Who follows? Rock, Paper, Scissors? All right. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Shoot. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Shoot. Ooh. Let's go.
