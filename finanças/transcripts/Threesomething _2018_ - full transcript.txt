[computer beeping] - Charlie? - Zoe? - Hey! - Hi! - How's it going? - Good. How are you? Good. I haven't seen you in a while. I know. It's be a while now, hasn't it? This is my friend, Isaac. - Hello... [indistinct] - Hello. Hi. - Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. What's up, guys? - Nothing, just hangin'. - Yeah? I want-- I want to see you. I want to catch up with you and stuff. I know. I would love that. It's been a really-- My place? You wanna have dinner here? - Yeah! Yeah! - Maybe, like... I don't know. Have a dance party or something? Yeah, let's do that. Let's have a dance party. Fuck, yeah. Awesome. Cool, that'll be fun. Um, tomorrow, or what are you thinking, this weekend? - Yeah, tomorrow night? - Can I bring some people? What? Can I bring some friends, or is this-- Is it a party? To be totally clear, just 'cause I don't wanna... do this. Uh... we're interested in having a threesome, and we're wondering if you're also interested in this. I mean this with complete respect. I just feel like we should be upfront about what kind of we're interested in and, uh, and not kind of, you know, feel like we're luring you into any weird situation where your expectations are different. I just-- I wanted to be upfront about that, if that's okay. - Uh, are you-- - I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Wait, are you guys serious? Wait. Are you-- Are you serious? - We were, like-- - Is this a joke? - Okay. Well-- - It's not a joke. I'm sorry if I upset you or anything. We were, like, talking about threesomes-- I feel like you guys are punking me or something. We're not punking you, I... We-- No, we... were talking about threesomes and stuff, and, like, and your name... came up. And my name came up? Yeah. I mean we weren't-- I wasn't-- - Look... - I didn't know that we were gonna-- Just let me handle it. Look, I-I... you seem like a great person. I think it could be a lot of fun. Uh, we're having a dinner tomorrow night. Maybe you wanna come to dinner just to, like... It's not-- We're not, like, having a dinner. We're having dinner, and maybe you could be there, and we could get to know each other better. - Um... - I do want you to come to dinner. I wanna hang out-- I do wanna hang out with you and catch up with you and have dinner. Okay, wait. This is not a joke? This isn't a joke. Okay, I'm just gonna make this really clear. It's not-- It's not a joke, but if you come to dinner, - and you're not interested-- - Wait. I'm just gonna end the call. It's been really nice talking to you. I'm glad that we got to meet over here, uh, and I will talk-- we'll talk to you soon. - Um, okay, yeah. - I think it's... Just hopefully you come to dinner, and it'd be great to see you at dinner. Just to clarify, just to clarify. - Farewell. - Uh... - [beeping] - Uh... It's all on the table. I guarantee you, she texts you tomorrow and says, "I'm coming to dinner." I don't think you can make that guarantee. I guarantee it. I absolutely, 100% promise you that that's probably what's gonna happen. I think I probably am just not gonna have a relationship with her anymore. - That's fine. - That's okay. - And yet, you know... - Thank you for... ...the most honest thing prevails. [sighs] What are you gonna do? - There's nothing I can do. - Right. ♪ ♪ I think the text message "Down for dinner" also means that she's down for a threesome. - Yeah, maybe. - I know! Yes! - Yes, that's what it means. - Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. I don't know, man! This is so exciting! This is, like-- This is honestly-- I've been wanting to do this for so long. I know, I know. It means it's probably gonna happen. That's the best part about it. Are you not nervous at all about it? I just feel like... I'm about to have this incredible experience with this, I think, pretty cool chick and my best friend. [mutters] Yeah. I'm your best friend, too, right? I feel so put on the spot when you ask me that sometimes. I just wanna know. Because you never call me your best friend, but I feel like I am your best friend. I don't wanna throw that around. It's not throwing it around if it's a real thing. I just wanna know that I have a best friend! It so weird. I'm always calling you it, and you never say... Well, you call me your best friend too much. All right, man. Do you wanna just get your fucking place ready for this threesome? I really wanna show each other our penises before she comes over. I think we should probably save that for the actual thing. If she turns out to be down, and we've never seen each other's penises before, and we're in and we see it for that situation, and we see it for the first time, there's gonna be a weird moment. And I feel so insecure about this whole thing. I don't want there to be a weird moment in it. I don't... ♪ She's almost here, right? And... I want us to do this before she gets here. All right. If this-- If it'll make you feel better, I'm fine to do it. I just... - It will. - All right. Should we just turn and look on three? - That's sounds fine. - Okay. All right. Okay. [both] One, two, three. [Charlie chuckles] All right. I feel a lot better. Yeah. Did you just laugh? No, I got, like, a little nervous. I don't think I laughed. I feel better. I'm happy we saw. We're gonna see 'em anyway. Okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah, this is great. Okay. Let's... All right, I'm gonna pull my pants up. Um, and then my dad told my little brother he could, uh, get a, uh, a car-- 'cause he just got his license-- for, uh, if he finished his community service hours. So that was, I don't know, it's not that exciting, but-- [Isaac] I'm gonna be really honest. I'm a little bit distracted by the fact that you're here right now. I personally didn't think that you were gonna come over, uh, after I mentioned the whole threesome idea. - Oh, um... - Just gonna put that out there. Oh, wait, okay. I'm-I'm kinda wondering the same thing. Are you... you're-- You wanna do this? Is that what you're saying? Wait, hold on. You... Okay, so you are asking me to have a threesome, basically. Uh, I wouldn't say that we're asking you to. - I don't think-- - Oh, okay. Like, I guess I'm curious, are you interested in a threesome? And if not, that's okay, too. We just want you to be comfortable. That feels pretty much good to say, the way I said it. Um... [chuckles nervously] I mean... You guys... wanna have a threesome. - I think we do. - Yeah. Yeah, we just, we just... we just kinda wanna, like, make sure that we're all understood. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah, okay, we are. - Understood. - We're-we're understood. I don't think we need to even have any more dinner. Yeah, I don't even think I could eat any more. I've been eating a lot to try to get us... Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Um, but thank you. The sweet rice was really good. Oh, yeah, I was happy with how it came out. Do you guys wanna discuss boundaries? - I think so. Yeah. - Okay. Maybe no, like... hardcore stuff. I think it's best we define hardcore at the outset. - Oh, okay, yeah. - 'Cause I don't know. I mean, I think we all might have different-- Let's just all be on the same page as to what hardcore actually means. Actually, I have a good idea. How about we just see if it occurs, and then I'll just... say something? I kinda prefer-- That could be dangerous. - Yeah. - Oh, really? Just kinda like... start touching each other. Let's touch each other's hands. - Um... Oh! - What are you doing? I thought we could... I thought we could... I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry. I was trying to start some-- I don't know. I-I personally feel just stiff and odd and unnatural, and I think that maybe... I don't know, like... get in our body or something. Yeah, I think we should get in our bodies. - Get in our bodies, you know? - Yeah. ♪ [man singing in French] [Zoe giggles] [Zoe pants] [cloth rips] [mutters] Oh, shit. - [whispers] What? - [whispers] I ripped my dress.

I didn't ever care about the sex. It wasn't about that. She and I had a crush on each other when we were younger. That's all. Honey, I really need to focus. I cooked beautifully. I cleaned my apartment beautifully. I was so nice to her when she was crying. Was I acting weird? I could have been acting kinda weird. Honey, I really need to do this work. I might have been acting really weird. I honestly think you're looking at it from a different... from the wrong perspective. I think you need to shift your perspective on it. The key in these situations, if you're gonna have a threesome, is to know that, first of all, they're always gonna choose one or the other. Even if it's not a physical choice, energetically, there's gonna be a choice. Do you remember the time, about a year and a half ago, when I went to the Wu-Tang Clan concert back in Seattle? And I went with that guy Robert? And at the last minute, he pulled an extra ticket, and he's like, "Do you want to invite a friend?" I was like, "Yeah. My friend Lucy's in town." And so, uh, the three of us end up going to Seattle. We're at the concert, we're drinking, we're, you know, we smoked a little weed, and we end up back at the hotel, and pretty soon I realized, you know, I knew what was up. It was gonna be a threesome. So... [chuckles] I started feeling the vibes that he was choosing her. And, mind you, we'd been drinking these cucumber mint mojitos. And I looked down. I don't know what came over me, but I had this burst of inspiration, and I grabbed that cucumber, and I started using it on him. Yeah. I got weird. He loved it. All of a sudden, it was all about me. He chose me. And I gotta tell you, ever since I've been doing that, I've been getting so much D. Like, an astonishing amount. Mom! "Schedule your civil ceremony." - Tomorrow you'll have my last name. - Twenty-five dollars? Tomorrow, you'll be, like, a different person. I... I kinda like my last name. Well, we're gonna get married. You gotta take my last name. But I like my last name. But... Can we do a hyphen or something? I don't know. - That's kinda weird. - Yeah. But my last name's better. What if you took my last name? What if you took my last name? I-I... People made fun of me for my last name my whole life. I'll do it, yeah. You'll take my last name? Kind of a way out for me.

I remember, uh, I was doing laundry, and you came in, and, uh, you didn't have enough quarters to finish your dry cycle. And I had some extra quarters, 'cause I'm always well-prepared for things, and, um, I gave them to you, and you were really appreciative of it, and that made me feel very good. Because a lot of times you do stuff for people, they don't really appreciate it.

We wanted to take the feeling that we had and just dive in. You went to the courthouse and you got married? We had a ceremony at her place. Uh, we had a bunch of candles lit. It was very romantic. And just, you know, we just wanted to do it right. Mazel tov. - Wow. - Exciting news. - I'm so happy for you. - Thank you, Charlie. I really appreciate it. I'm thinking about taking the day-- I might go camping. I might-- I might just go out into the wilderness and just kinda go... "This is me! This is the world!" You find yourself in that environment, and you probably appreciate it more being away from her. - Yeah. - Yeah. Because you know, you guys know that you have a connection when you're with each other, but you also need to know that you can be your own separate people. That's where most relationships go wrong, and you guys are heading that off from the start, and that's fucking smart. That means a lot, man. And, you know, I... I can see, you know, I can see us hanging out more, you know? Instead of just seeing each other around the apartments, the apartment complex, it can be like, "Hey, wanna come over for a cup of coffee in the morning?" - A brewski, you know? - I like that. - You know? - I love that. I mean, we're best friends, and so having some new blood and having some new energy around here will be so great. I mean, this could be the new group. I think we should all show each other our penises. I think we should all take our penises out and-and-and show them to each other and see who we all really are. All right, man. - I love you. - I love you, too, man. Can you say it without saying "man"? I just feel like it means more. You know what I mean? I love you.
