SCREENPLAY YOSHINAGA FUJIOKA 37th ART AWARD HIDEO KIMATA GRAND PRIZE HIDEO KIMATA I love you, Tomie, TOMIE: REBIRTH Hideo, what's that? MIKI SAKAI SATOSHI TSUMABUKI KUMIKO ENDO DIRECTOR TAKASHI SHIMIZU Don't you have something to say? I'm home. Welcome home. I was out drinking with Shunichi until now. A cute girl called you today. Rie said she is coming tomorrow. Relieved, aren't you? - What? - Did you think it was that girl? Are you still worrying? I told you it was over. Where were you drinking? - It's none of your business. - Takumi! Damn. Takumi, I love you, Hello? Oh, it's you. What? What are you talking about? No. I'm not doing anything. I don't handle alcohol well. Don't make me drink, please. - So I will eat a lot! - Me too, me too! This place isn't a buffet, is it? Excuse me. Bring us Chanko Nabe. What were you thinking? Idiots! You guys are depressed. That's why I planned this party. Get a new girl and forget your ex. But look at those girls. Yumiko! - Save my seat. - Where are you going? - Come back. - Yeah, I will. What's up, you three? You guys seem sad. Came back from a funeral? Of course we are upset. Look at the quality of the girls. Just a second. Don't be picky. You didn't give me much time to get them. I did my best. - I guess that's okay, then. - What's that? There are no good boys here either. Hey. Get out of my way. Hey. I heard. You got a great award or something, didn't you? You know I like the arts and stuff... - What's going on? - Is the power out? Could somebody ask someone who works here? - Can I help you? - The lights went out in that room. - Lights? - Lights. Did you come to the party late? Tomie. Tomie? Do you know this girl, Hideo? - Really? - Hey, who is she? - Who is she? - When did she come? - Hello. I'm Hiroaki. - You are cute. - Are you a singer or something? - My name is Masaru. - What do you do for fun? - Tell me your telephone number. You, go away! Tomie is mine. - What is he saying? - What? - Let's go. - How do they know each other? Hey, I haven't finished my story yet. Well, she is very cute. What are you going to do? It's not like that, She came here late, so... - We were just greeting her, - You liars, When did I become yours? Murderer... It's a boring party. You asked us out. You don't understand my kindness, do you? This is called friendship. This party? We can't leave him alone, right? Right. Hey, Hideo. Hey, Hideo. Number two? Don't puke at the party. Yumiko must have made him drink. No. He got sick because of all the ugly girls. - That's you! - What? - What's wrong? - You embarrassed me. - Yumiko, what's this? - You owe me one, okay? What are you talking about? I'm talking to her! Saori, are you coming? - I know a good place... - Shut up, fat ass. - Tomie, are you... - I know a good restaurant. - Let's go out together sometime. - What? Do you want to fight? - Tomie, I'm sorry about that. - Shut up, you! - Look, that girl... - What? She wasn't here earlier. Wow, she is cute. No. I mean... yesterday... Yesterday? Hideo? Hideo? Are you okay? What? Yeah. It must be Rie. I'm coming. Really? Then are you going tonight? I'm sorry it took so long to make. I'm sorry we came at such a bad time. - No. Here you go. - Thank you. He didn't tell me anything about you, Hitomi. Well, Mom. You don't have anything to do... in this apartment anymore. You'd better shut up. Thanks for letting Rie stay here for a couple of days. I came here to go to a concert. That's all. Call me tonight, okay? By the way, where should I sleep? There are only two rooms, right? You and Hitomi will sleep here... What do you mean? I'm curious. Don't worry. I won't make much noise. What kind of place is Yunozawa? - Well... - It's just country side. Right. There aren't really any famous sites to see. But please come to visit us sometime. There is a beautiful waterfall on the mountain behind our house. Is that the place you told me about before? Oh, hey, bro. Some TV station came the other day. Is it a famous waterfall? For a special horror show. The ghosts of people who killed themselves appear there. Don't say such things. Not many people came. Hideo's mother is very strong. If it were my mother, she'd go crazy. She must be heartless. She is a mother who would leave her only son alone in that big house. She must spend all her time at some guy's place. He must have been lonely then. I'm jealous that you are stupid. What does that mean? Nothing. By the way, are you trying to not bring that up? What? I know we've been thinking about the same thing. That girl... Let's not talk about that. I can't ignore it. The body... Let's go check it. - I don't want to. - Are you scared? I don't know. But I don't think it's a good idea to get involved again. I see. I understand! Hey... You are looking for me, aren't you? You... What? Can't you even talk? You are so arrogant in front of everyone. - That's strange. - Don't come closer! You are terrible. You were looking for me. You are sweating so much. You are ruining your good looks. You didn't even hesitate to pour mud on my face, did you? It was very disgusting. Little rocks, bugs... They came into my mouth, you know. You too? Shun... Look, I think... Hideo must have had some troubles that he couldn't tell anyone. Hello. I know you were looking at me tonight. Why didn't you save me? Our eyes met each other. After Hideo did it to me... I hit my head because you dropped me. Hey. Takumi. Who is she? Oh, I think I've seen you before. - Who are you? - Uh! I just remembered your face. I see. I understand. You two are... This is unpleasant. Takumi, what does it mean? Who is she? Takumi and l... Where did we meet for the first time? I won't tell her. The last time we met was at the party, wasn't it? The party? Who are you? What's your relationship with T akumi? Are you mad? Who are you, anyway? I'm... T akumi's girlfriend! I know. You are Hitomi, aren't you? When I was attacked tonight... he was watching me from far away. But he hid and didn't help me. Then he ran away. Don't you think he is terrible? Let's go home. Takumi, you have a lot of funny friends. Can I be your friend, too? What are you saying? Are you crazy or something?! Takumi. See you. Don't come close anymore! You are scary. But I don't think that will happen. See you again. Takumi, I want to talk to you. Wait. I'm tired. Don't run away! Shun? Shun? Your friend came. It's a girl. I'm back! What do you want? The girl came to the party... Is it about the girl who came late? Why? You are the fourth person. Why does everyone like her? - I'm not like that. - Really? Look. Who brought the girl? I asked all the girls, but no one knows about her. What? I think Hideo called her. He seemed to know her. Her name is Tomie. I only know that. Tomie. Hello? You are Takumi, aren't you? Thanks for coming to the funeral last night. No problem. What's up today? Well, I just wanted to visit here. Then... why don't you look at his artwork? Do you know... if he had a girlfriend? Well, I don't really know... There are a few pictures of her. Don't you know her? Do you know her? Well, no. I see. His love must not have been returned. Hideo? Hideo? He is in here. - Is he drawing again? - What are you doing? What is it? Hideo... This is for you, Takumi. He came into my dream last night... and he told me he wanted me to give this painting to you. Will you accept it? Don't scream my name. Sorry... Don't leave me. Okay. I'll be more careful. Listen. I lost my lipstick. Could you buy me this? I like it. Shun. Mom. Hi. Could you go get cigarettes for me? I'll be back. 'Bye. 'Bye. I'm home, Mrs. Hosoda. I don't know what you are thinking. You'd better go home soon. You are good at putting on makeup. Cosmetic surgery has improved. It must be easy to stretch your wrinkles. What do you want to say? I think you should stop that. You made a Buddhist altar for the guy who left you. What are you trying to protect? You are even lying to your son. Who... are you?! Who are you? You don't even know who you are. Ouch! Tomie! Why did you do that to her?! Are you okay? Let's cool your hand. I'm sorry. I made coffee. I'm sorry about earlier. Are you all right? This is expensive coffee. I don't like coffee. You can have it, Mom. What's wrong? Won't you drink? Is there any poison in it? I just had some not long ago. It's not that bad, soybean coffee. - Where is Rie? - She is in the bathroom. Look... What did you think of Hideo? What? Hideo? What does it mean? They were in his room. So? So... I think he liked you... Stop it! I don't want to hear that. The death of Hideo is none of my business... What I want is... I want to know about you, Takumi! Who is that girl? - There is nothing between us. - Don't lie to me. I'm not lying. Then explain it to me! Well... What? What's this? This is the same color as her lipstick! Well, this must be... And the painting. Did you see it? She is the model, isn't she? It's not like that. That was Hideo's... Hideo knew that, too? You guys laughed at me? - Stop it! - Tell me the truth! The night you didn't come home, you were seeing her! Hitomi. I'M GOING TO SCHOOL. TAKUMI Oh, that's a new color, right? Yeah. Let me see. This color is not good for you, Hitomi. It's okay. It was a gift. It's not from my brother, is it? I don't know. I heard my brother cheated on you. Did Takumi say that? I was right. This is what you guys are fighting about. You outwitted me. You, witch! Wait! You are not so sweet. Aren't you a little too sweet? Look, I'm going home tomorrow. Take me to Shibuya or something. - I know you aren't busy. - I am not treating you. I'm sorry he couldn't see you. It's okay. He is cooped up in his room and doesn't come out lately. I'll come again. Takumi, wait. Do you know a girl named Tomie? What? What about her? It's okay if you don't know. Forget it. Mrs. Hosoda, wait. Mrs. Hosoda, wait. Mrs. Hosoda? Mrs. Hosoda? I know, You are Hitomi, aren't you? Hey. Here. Do you really want me to bring it home? Don't complain. Because where do you want to keep it? Some closet or a barn, wherever. - Brother. - What? You'd better take good care of Hitomi. I know. I know. 'Bye. I'm home. Listen. The last time, I was... Oh, you are home. What are you doing? Nothing. We can still use it. It's okay! I don't want it! I'm home. Why are you cleaning? Tomie said the things you touch smell bad. What are all these? Tomie doesn't like things that someone else has used. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! - Shun... - Uh! Don't touch me! If your smell gets on me, I can't go close to Tomie. Hitomi. Where am I? This is... Are you feeling bad? It was a nightmare. Shunichi was... Shunichi? Shunichi was... Well, never mind. It was nothing. Good night. Good night. Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?! Shun. I'm sorry. Did I wake you? Is this... Tomie? Yes. Mom. Hold it. You are a man. Very strong. Remember? When you were a kid, we used... to make crafts for summer homework. Yeah. It was fun at that time. Mom, I really appreciate you. What are you saying all of the sudden? After my father died... life was not easy... but you bought me anything I wanted. Don't worry about it. I will care about you more from now on, Mom. Don't worry. Be just as you are. Hitomi? Hey, Hitomi. Hey! Hitomi? Hitomi? Hitomi! Hey! Hey! Hitomi! Hitomi! It's been a long time since we walked together. Yeah. I was the top salesperson in the company for this period. That's great. I will get an award tomorrow morning. - Let me rest for a second. - Are you okay? - I can carry it. - I'm fine. I will get a little extra money. Why don't we go to a hot spring? Yeah. Let's celebrate tonight! - Really? - Yeah. I'm so happy! - Are you okay? - Yeah. - I'll do that. - Thanks. Shunichi? - What? - What's wrong? - Let's go. - Okay. Shunichi, Shun. Did you hear something? What? What's wrong? What? Shun? Shun. You are hurting me. Let go of my hand. Shun... This... Murderer. Monster... Shunichi... I like you. Why did you throw me away? What are you doing?! Hey, what are you doing?! Stop! Let go of her, old bitch! Shun. What did you just say?! It hurts. Damn it! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Don't touch me with those dirty hands, wrinkled old bitch! I'm joking. But you have so many wrinkles. Shut up, laughing sack. I'll show you what will happen to you. What are you doing? - Are you mad? Let me go! - Tomie... Where are you taking me? Let me go! - Stop it, Mom. - Let me go! Let her go. Mom! What is this place? Shunichi... It's a joke, right? Let me out of here, Mom! I won't do anything bad anymore. Don't pretend to be cute, you wicked monster! You are the monster, Mom! Murderer! Someone, help me! Just die quietly. See you again. Good-bye, Tomie. It's been a long time, Is no one home? My mother is sleeping. She has some weird disease. What did you want to talk about? Shunichi, did you... tell Hitomi about that? "That"? About the girl we buried in the mountain. Did you tell Hitomi? Why would I tell Hitomi about that? Then why does she know about it? Hitomi... what did she say about it? She saw it in her dream. Dream? She sees the same dream over and over. You know what is going on, don't you? She is not Hitomi. What are you talking about? The girl? What do you know?! Tomie never dies. She comes back to life and multiplies. But why did Hitomi become... It doesn't matter. I can see... Tomie again. I know you wished for that too. What? I knew it. You wanted to see Tomie. What are you talking about? You asked Yumiko about Tomie. You came to see me, only because you wanted to know about Tomie. Who do you love? Hitomi... - Or... - No! It's not... Not her. No way. Never mind. I'll come again. I can't leave my mother alone. What's wrong? You are Hitomi, right? Do you know me? What? What's wrong? Do you remember where we went on our first date? Yeah... Well? Where did we go on our first date? Where was that? T akumi? Did you use it? Did you use this lipstick?! Once. Why? What's wrong? Odaiba... It was the first time we went to Odaiba. We were pretty frisky there. And then... Don't look at me like that. What will I become now? Don't worry. Soon... Soon I won't remember anything. Are you okay with that, Takumi? Don't you leave me! Will you stay with me? Of course! Hello? Is it Shunichi? My mother died, Thanks for coming. I feel sorry for her son. He is handsome, but... - Thank you. - She didn't say... Did she divorce her husband? She had a weird disease, You'd better rest, Mom. Don't worry. Her heart stopped already. But just now... Don't worry about it. Shunichi... You motherfucker! She tastes like Tomie. She is not Hitomi. She is Tomie. You love Hitomi, right? - Shut up! - I see. You're trying to keep Tomie for yourself, aren't you? Shut up! Are you jealous? Takumi. Hitomi? Hitomi? No. No! I was looking through the album. Then I got dizzy... I felt I was not myself or something. Did you have any dreams? It was a white dream. Over there, there is a room kind of thing... A room? A dog... A dog was barking. Someone came in... It was a girl. Something round... Tire? A motorbike? The barn! The painting! Hey! Takumi! I won't give Tomie to you! She told me she loved me! Gon is so noisy! He is barking so much tonight. Shut him up, will you? But he is a dog. Dogs bark, you know. Did you walk him today? I got a day off. Can't help. He is horny. - Same as you. - Stupid old man! It's your fault. You didn't walk him today. You are the one who wanted to have a dog. Okay, okay, Gon. Here. Go ahead, eat. Good boy. There is nothing wrong here. So... what happened to the girl in your dream? I don't know... I woke up before I found out. Something is wrong. What's wrong? Hitomi? Takumi? You! I missed you. You came to see me. I was looking for you too. You were kind to me. You... No! You even fought with your friend to protect me. No! You... I am trying to protect... Hitomi! No. You just don't want to admit that. Shut up! L... Hitomi... Only Hitomi is... Don't try to be a tough guy. Why don't you give up those foolish feelings? I'm sure you already know your feelings. L... That's right. You always wanted to have me. Since even before you were born. You... What the hell are you? The same question again? You guys are... always, always, always, always... always, always, always... always! You guys always ask the same thing. It's not interesting. Then who the hell are you? You don't even know who you are. You can't live without believing something. You get scared if you don't know something for sure. Am I right? It's been like that. Everyone is the same. They all come on to me... but when the time comes... Are you the same? You... Why were you born? Why are you living in this world? Why are you here now? Takumi... I... like you too. Takumi! You. No, Hitomi. Don't get near her. She is a monster. A monster? Then she is a monster too. Are you my older sister? Or are you my younger sister? What do you mean? What is it? You are me. You are a failure, though. Takumi buried me in the woods and poured mud on me. Yes. That's right. I was... wrapped in a white cloth... and... Takumi and Shunichi carried me... Hitomi... She does not exist. Before you met me... you just picked whomever you could. Am I right? A failure? You said that earlier, didn't you? Yes. Look at yourself. Takumi. I'll forgive you for what you have done to me. So... kill this woman. Takumi... kill this woman, please. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her, kill her... - Kill her, kill her... Burn her now. It won't change anything. Even if you kill me. I'm sure you know that, too. I never die. You want me because of that. - It's worthless. - Kill her now. End this now. You are silly. See you again. Shunichi! Hey! What?! Let me go! Let me go! Where are you taking me?! Hey, wait! You are hurting me! Stop it! Stop it now! - Where are we going? - Hitomi... Let me go! What is this place? Isn't it beautiful? Let's go together. What are you thinking? I don't understand. To be together, we don't have any other choice. L... l... It's you, isn't it? You... It's my fault you became... I'm sorry... I'm a very difficult girl. I'm noisy, jealous, selfish... I remember! When we went to Odaiba, we lost the wallet and couldn't buy anything. That's right. We didn't have any money... But for the first time we... I'm glad that I met you. L... Takumi, you can run away! If you are with me... No! I won't let you go alone. Let's live. We can survive together. - I like you. - Tomie...
