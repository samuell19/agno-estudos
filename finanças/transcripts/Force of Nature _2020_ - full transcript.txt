Follow me. Come on, you... Can't get a shot. Come on... Come on. There's a storm right now. A hundred and sixty miles per hour. And we still have gusts around 190. So this area, this territory, is certainly very much in danger. Fifteen inches of rainfall possible across parts of Puerto Rico. And life-threatening mudslides and really more flash flooding. This is where we will see the storm surge, storm winds... There will certainly be damage. The entire territory will be absolutely under the control of this category four, maybe category five storm. Shh. You got something we want. Walk normal. You walk normal. If you say anything I'll shoot you and the person next to you. How can I help you? Thank you. He... he wouldn't even tell me his name. It was... it was arranged through a third-party. - I don't know anything... - Calm down, calm down. It's okay. What's the address? Here's Puerto Rico: 3.5 million Americans live there. And here it comes, right along the shore. But San Juan is still going to have winds of 130 to 140 miles an hour. There will be weeks without power. There may be weeks without water. I need to sit. I need... Please, I need to... John. John. Let's go. Where's Babie? The old prune panicked. Babie was aborted. Come on. Let's go. Whoo. - Hey, Pete. - Hey. Cardillo, I need the keys to the prisoner holding cell. Yes, sir. There you go. Mom make bail? Cardillo! - Wow. Yeah? - This is Officer Pena. She'll be assisting with the evacs. - Hey. - Congratulations. The two of you will take the van. You'll be scouring every last motherfucking inch - for anybody that's left. - But... You find 'em, you take 'em to the safety shelters. - I'm really looking forward to... - That's not my job. It is today. Get your ass out there. Good luck. Okay. I'll wait for you outside. Fuck. Hey. We're going to get you those burgers, huh? Hey, man. Do you mind leaving some for the rest of us? Excuse me? You took all the meat. Oh, God. Come on, man. Need just some meat for my kid. What do you wanna do, man, huh? You wanna fight me in front of your kid? Excuse me. Excuse me! That man just grabbed a pack of ground beef right out of my son's hand. What? What are you talking about? What? Sir, I'm gonna have to take your cart and ask you to leave. Whoa, whoa! Any advice? About? This precinct. The residents. Oh. Don't trust 'em. But... that applies everywhere. Not just the places, um, don't speak the fucking language. Oh, yeah? Well, uh, I'm actually trying to transfer into this house. Or Rio Píedras, I don't know. Something with more action. - Yeah. - It's slow as hell up in Zone Two. That's why I volunteered today. - Okay. - Okay. So how are we gonna play this? Play what? What if people refuse to leave? Well, then they die horrible fucking deaths. But this good news is, is it ain't our fault. We're not picking anyone up. - Yeah, but, uh, Lt. Cunningham said that we have to... - Okay, okay, okay. Let's just say that we go out and we grab a guy, right? He doesn't wanna leave. He wants your name, he wants your badge number to file a complaint. Yeah, let him. I'm doing my job. Oh, like, that matters? You want a transfer or a promotion, and the bosses, they're gonna look at your record, right? Oh, see you got a complaint. Could be bullshit. Doesn't matter. You wash your hands at the sink and you get splash back, it still looks like you pissed yourself. Okay. So we're doing nothing? That's the idea. Maybe we'll get some donuts later. 10-52, Plaza del mercado de Rio Píedras. Don't. Show sector Adam, Boy, Charlie responding. All right. You insist. All righty then. What happened? Um, he was trying to clear out the meat section, and he got into a fight with a customer. Mm... clear out the meat section. What, the entire section? Is there a law against how much meat I can buy? Sure isn't, but how much meat were you trying to buy? Just for the record. - A hundred pounds. - Oh, wow. - Quite the party. - Yeah, that's a lot of meat. - Yeah. - Yeah. Uh, where's the victim? Guy left. Didn't wanna press charges. All he wanted was to make hamburgers for his little kid. - Well, that's adorable. - See, the guy didn't wanna press charges. Y'all gonna let me go, right? Yeah, well, you tell me what you need all that meat for, I'll consider it. Huh... That... is a little suspicious. Let's go. Let's go. - Y'all arresting me? - No. We're putting you on a bus to a shelters. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. - Y'all can't do that. - No? - I'm pretty sure we can. - I have to stop past my place. - Yeah? - Yo, officer, I'm being serious. - This is very important. - No. Are you just gonna give me one-word answers? - Maybe. - All right. Let's go. - You know what, fuck you. - Oh, no. - Fuck you, too. - Oh, yeah? - Fuck you. - You walk... Whoa! That escalated quickly. Yo, officer, I got some people at my place - that are refusing to leave. - Yeah, who? Well, there's this old guy who never leaves. And a cop. One of you guys. How do you know they don't wanna leave? Well, the old guy, he never leaves. And the cop was just bragging about how he wasn't going nowhere. Look, I have a pet. That's why I'm here at the supermarket. - You have a pet? - Yeah. - What kind of pet? - A hungry one. Uh-huh. What's its name? Her name is Janet. Yeah, I don't... I don't like that. Well, Janet doesn't like cops. Look, guys... Y'all can arrest me, do whatever the hell you wanna do. But I need to see her and get her some water before the storm. Please. You said there's a cop that won't leave? Yeah. All right. Let's go feed your fuckin' cat. That the super? Yeah. Yeah, that's him. - What's your name? - Luillo. Alright, Louie Joe. This guy says you got residents that are refusing to evacuate. - That's right. - He said you got a retired cop and an old guy. - Old guy in 15E. - And the cop? Barrett, 53B. All right, let's grab Barrett, and then we'll swing back down and grab the old guy, okay? - Okay. - You gonna let me feed Janet? - What apartment you in? - Thirty-three-B. - Is that true? - Yes. All right, do it quick. We'll grab you in five minutes, alright? Fine. Gracias... Does that say "out of order"? - What is that? - Si. - Si. - Si. Si. Perfect. Alright. You know, you should learn some Spanish. - Yeah. - Yeah, you're in Puerto Rico. - Yeah. - That's how we say it. Puerto Rico. Can you get them to fuck off? We're evacuating the building. We're evacuating the building. Thank God. I need your help. Look, even the PD's taking this seriously. Yeah, current PD's full of pussies. Care more about liability and politics. I'm staying here. I'm not leaving. I'm not going anywhere. You gonna take that risk? Well, Hurricane Irene started like this, came to nothing. She wants to take me to Centro Medico. That third-rate shithole. I mean, that's death depot. We used to take OD cases there. I don't recall seeing any of them ever again. Well, unfortunately, sir, it's either that or the evac bus. Excuse me, senorita. You all right there? You worked in Rio Píedras? Yeah, I used to run that house. Do I know you? I know you. 'Cause I just put in a transfer there. Is that right? Where do I know you from? I know you. - I know you from someplace. - Uh... from this evac. - Sir, can we get your stuff? - Yeah, let's get going. You're Cardillo. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Cardillo. You had that thing about a year ago, right? Yeah? How'd it go down? It got me down here. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried about it.. They catch the guy that made the call? Eventually, yeah. Yeah? Did you beat his ass? - Dad... - Did I what? Did you beat his ass? Hey, back in my day we had this moron called Willie Bosket. He used to call the stationhouse to report a rape or a robbery. We'd all rush down there, the guy'd be on the roof with a BB gun, sniping us. About the third around we caught him and broke a few fingers. - Nice, Dad. That's real nice. - Hey, it stopped him. Okay? - Yep. - Hey, the other cop, the partner. That was your girl, right? Troy, honey, uh, I think I like my odds better here. I'm a stubborn asshole, she takes after me. I'm standing right here, you know what I mean? Hey, what do you think I got fuckin' Alzheimer's...? It's a Category 5 fuckin' hurricane goin' on outside, and you forgot about that. You think it's a five already? Hey, lay it out for me. How did it go down? Tell me. Alright, I'm gonna go grab the other old guy. - Sir, I highly advise... - Other old guy? - ...that you go with your daughter. - Yes, thank you. Or in this case, your guardian. - Oh, a fuckin' comedian, yeah. And it's only out of respect for the badge that you're not on a 51-50 hold, face down on the ground, - hog-tied and fuckin' cuffed... - Whoa, whoa, hey! What, you gonna shoot me, too? Okay, you hear me, you crazy old fuck?! - Shut the fuck up! - You cop-killing cocksucker! - Hey! - Where you goin? - Where you goin'? - You stay! Yeah, and don't go with that guy. Not without a bulletproof vest. Honestly, you are so fuckin' stubborn. This guy's your fuckin' partner? Yep. You're a very brave girl. Hey, hey! What are you... What are you doing? You're just gonna leave? Your dad doesn't wanna leave, ma'am. I can't force him. Isn't that what you're here for? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to carry him down? Hey, you know what, I don't care what you do. He needs his dialysis machine, but once the storm knocks the power out in this building, nothing's going to work. No machine is gonna work. I have a bed for him reserved at the hospital, but if we don't get there soon, we lose it. You really a doctor? No, I just like wearing pajamas all day. Look, all I'm asking you to do, is to go back in there with me, and help me get him the fuck out of this building. Well, Officer Pena's with him, okay. She'll take him down. He doesn't exactly respond to female authority. Alright. You know this old guy, right? Yeah, I've seen him around. Do me a favor, and help me with him. And once we get him out we'll come back up, and we'll grab your father. Okay? Alright. Come on. Around the corner to the left. Down there. Straight ahead. This guy always have this much security? Not that I recall. Sir? Hello, sir, it's Troy Barrett. You know my father, Ray. Hello, sir. What can I help you with? You need to come with us, sir. No, I cannot leave. You're gonna be flooded out here if you stay, you're on the first floor. It's too dangerous. Has your father left? We're gonna evacuate him right after you. Cardillo to Pena. The sooner you come with me... We're gonna get him, we're gonna get everyone safe out of the building. Pena, are you there? Cardillo, you copy? Crickets, huh? All your comms are down in this shit. Hey, listen, sweetheart. You don't need to babysit me, okay. So you ran Rio Píedras, huh? Yeah, you're not leaving. Okay. Okay, you don't take a hint, do ya? I'll be clearer. You can go now. Thank you. It's... - So... - I'm good, thank you. I'm trying to transfer into that house, but it's being held up. So... you think you can put in... a word for me? Pena, do you copy? I know it feels safer to stay here, but we gotta get to higher ground. You cannot park there! I'm safer here, I'm safer here. I'm not leaving. I cannot leave my home. Hey! Hey! You can park back there. Keep it moving! Get out! You cannot park there! I'll take care of this. What is it with the stubborn bastards in this building? - You have to come with us. - I'm sorry, I'm not going. Officer! - Hold on just a second. I'll be right back. - Okay. - So you can go. - No, this is an evacuation. Please, just go. They are closing the roads. Please, keep going. Come on, man. Take it easy. Take it easy... Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go now! - You alright? - Why? We've gotta go right now. Come on! Come on! Right now! Okay. Come here. Come on! Quick, quick! Ernesto... It's a fucking cop! No, no, no. Don't shoot. You might hit the old man. Migs, you need to catch up with them. Top floor. - Who the hell were those guys? - I have no idea. We have to get back to my dad. No, it's too far. We won't make it. They'll see us. Well, then where are we going? Up. Come... Come on. Come on. What are we gonna do about the fucking cop? Don't get excited. They're trapped. Those stairs only lead up and the only exit is on this floor. Dillon, start your way on top and work your way down. Pride, Ernesto, you two guard the front door. Nobody gets in. Nobody gets out. Okay? Go. Let's go. Janet! I'm sorry, baby. I'm coming. I got caught up in the supermarket. Alright. Here we go. I know, I know, I know, I know. Open the door, right now! Open the door. I'll meet you downstairs. Open the door, Griffin. Griffin, open the door! You gotta let us in, right now. Fuck that! How I know you're not setting me up? Back, back, back... Griffin, you think this is a trap? I let you go earlier. Listen, I've got Troy and your downstairs neighbor here. You don't understand right now. We are gonna get our motherfuckin' heads blown off! Open the door. Shit. We on the same side? Hey, do me a favor, alright? Put your ear to the door. I'm gonna tell you something. - Put your ear to the door! - My ear's to the goddamn door! Okay. Open the fucking door! Central, 10-13. Shots fired. Okay... Who's killing who? - Just quiet down. Be quiet. - No you quiet down! You in my house. Shots fired at... What's the address here? - Six... sixty-five... - Six-five-eight. Six-five-eight... Fuck! Land line. I need a land line. - Do you have a land line? - Sorry, man, I didn't get the fuckin' bundle. - Who the fuck's got a land line, man? - Oh, fuck. You know, you guys bust into my place without any consideration. I don't give a fuck who shot who. Super Louie Joe... Well, he's super fucking dead, okay! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Give me that bowl of food! - What? - Give me that bowl of food! - What food? - Give me the bowl of food! - What? - Give me that bowl of food! Help! - Don't shoot. Don't shoot. - What? Don't shoot. Don't shoot? Just bring me that bowl of food. - What? - Bring me the bowl of food! It's right behind you. Bring me the bowl of food. Okay... Oh, my God. What the fuck? Stop, stop... - What? - Take off your uniform. Take off my fucking uniform? Yeah. She hates cops. I trained her. If you don't want her to bite your fuckin' ass take your uniform off. Okay. Tell me your story. What do you mean? What kind of story? A Disney story. What do you think? I want your story. Like your best collar. If you want a rec, you gotta gimme something to work with. There was a warrant out on a murder suspect about five months back. I'm on patrol driving by the Burger King off Avenida Ashford. And see a guy in the parking lot. Six-two, 160, long hair. We park and approach. But as I'm getting closer, I realize it's not the guy. Slow. Nothing too quick. Oh, my God. Alright, now you gonna grab my hand. Alright. And when I say, pull me out as fast as you can. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Alright. - Okay, here we go. Okay. Go! Close the door! Close the door! Close the door! What the fuck is that?! Oh, shit. I lost them. You lost them? They gotta be somewhere around in the building. - There's no other way out. - No. Shut the fuck up. Alright? No excuses! Okay? Go find them. Now, go! And that's your fucking pet? Fucking got a killing machine for a fucking service animal. Okay, we got a problem. What kinda bedside manner talk is this? "We got a problem." You don't wanna ease me in? Uh.. could really use a saw. Yeah, this would be a great point for an amputate. No, you're not cutting my leg off! We didn't have time to ease you in. What do you need? Uh, a splint to secure the femur. Anti-septic, penicillin, gauze, stitches. I know a doctor. Congratulations. He's here in the building. - Dr. Berman. - Yeah, what apartment? Where? It's uh... 63B. Shit... Alright, I'll go get that stuff. - Well, I'll come with you. - No, no, you gotta stay here with him... No, I'll come with you. The sooner we take care of this, the sooner I can get back to my father. Alright. Hey, come over here. Come here. Come, I need your help. I need you to take both your hands and apply pressure to this wound, okay. Hard. Talk to him, keep him awake. It's just as important as applying pressure to the wound. You got it? Okay. - Griffin... - Hm? There any back stairs? Alternate routes up? There's only one set of stairs. And the elevator, but the elevator's out. Yeah, of course it is. But there's another way. Scaffolding. Scaffolding. So... Oh, yeah... the guy we're looking for has tats and this guy's clean. But something was off. He looks nervous. My radar starts going off and that's when I see it. What? A giant bulge sticking out of his... - you know... - What, his crotch? What? No, his ass. I see the top of a plastic baggie sticking out the top of his pants. I ask him what it is, he goes nuts. We cuff him, took him back to the stationhouse, and when we strip search him we find 93 baggies of crack cocaine. Biggest narcotics collar that month. - Biggest. - Wow. So what you're telling me is you stumble onto a narcotics collar, oh, because some moron had a family-sized baggie sticking out of his ass? That's your best collar? You didn't even have probable cause. - Never mind. - No, you know, I'm just saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They should be done by now. I'm... I'm gonna go check on them. - Yeah... - Yeah, you can do... You can do, you know, whatever. I'm such an asshole. - You got it? - Yeah. So, two flights up and three units over. Yeah. Are you a good shot? Yeah, why? Do me a favor. If I fall, shoot me. I don't wanna wait four-and-a-half hours to die of a brain hemorrhage. Yeah, what if I fall? You're a hard-headed. You'll survive. - Ready? - Blow it. Watch it, sweetheart. Take your hand off your gun, slowly. Hands in the air. Where are they? Where are who? Your partner and the old man. Follow me. - I'll show you. - Go. Better not be fucking with me. Come on. Hey! You mind pointing that gun somewhere else? Hey, shut the fuck up. Is this it? This is it. You go first. If this is a fucking ambush, I swear to God, I will fucking kill you. Hey, asshole! Oh, yeah. Come on, now, help me drag him inside. He's a heavy motherfucker. Yeah, come on. Come on, buddy. Boss! Get down there. I'll go check on Chaz, bro. Don't worry. She won't break through. What's your name? Paul. Paul... What's the accent? German? - German, yes. - Mm-hm. I'm Jason. I'd offer to shake your hand, but I really need you to keep pushing down. Of course. Give me the gun. Oh, shit. Hey, it'll be okay. Yeah... They're on the fourth floor, heading up. - Where's Ernesto? - He's dead. Bigger splits for the rest of us. Ah... You recognize the name? Alexander Dillon. No. No, should I? You want to work the good cases, you gotta know the players. - Who is he? - He's part of a crew. He does high end heist jobs: jewelry, museums, armored trucks. The shot caller's a real psycho piece of shit. Calls himself John the Baptist. I got a buddy downtown, a lieutenant I trained, he works the major crime zone three. He's been chasing these clowns for a... for a month. You okay? Are you alright? Yeah. Hey... Can you do me a favor? Get my pills. Oxy, oxy... whatever the fuck you call it. I can't pronounce it. Uh, not that room. The next door down. That's my wife's art studio. The next door down is the bathroom. So did you read the paper? Today? No. No, why? So this crew targets this blue-haired old bag. But the bop the old girl before they could finish the job, the greedy fuckers. That was this guy Dillon? It's empty, by the way. Ah, yeah, thanks. This guy? Yeah. My buddy thinks he's one of them, yeah. I haven't worn this in 15 years. What if it still fits? What... what do you think these guys want? Yeah... I might have a pretty good idea. But if you're trying to make an impression, now's the time. Let's go. - What apartment is this? - 44B. All right... up and two over. She's this woman, came into the hospital bunch of times. Claimed cops used to hold her down and inject rat blood in her eyes. What? Roberta Gradischer? - You know her? - Oh, yeah. Wait a second. It was you. Right? It was you. That's what my father was referring to downstairs. Uh.. partially, yeah. Oh, my God. She used to say it was two cops. - Smith... - No, Smythe. Smith and Smythe. Exactly. Did you treat her? After four times, I had to give her an eye dropper. Told her there was holy water in it. That's funny. She actually brought that down to the lab. She wanted us to test it for rat poison. See? She didn't trust me either. She wanted me to file a police report. On me? Wait... let me see that. - Come here. - Oh, it's not... It's not. - Come here. - Oh, it's fine. Come here. - It's a surface wound... - Yeah, it's fine. No, it was a police report... It was for the commissioner. Yeah, she, uh... She thought that the police commissioner was stealing her coupons. No... shit. She's fuckin' nuts. You mind if I ask you something? I mind if you ask permission. You wanna ask something, just ask. What the hell did you stay for? I mean, you had to know the storm was gonna be bad. Right? Do you know what a fecal transplant is? - A what? - A fecal transplant. It's exactly what it sounds like. Doctor takes someone else's shit, puts it in your body. - What the hell for? - Yeah, right. It's good for colitis, or something. Troy wants me to do that. I also got some other bullshit going on. Kidneys, lungs... They're fucked. It's gonna kill me, eventually. I'm on a million pills. She takes me to the hospital, it's over, and I'm not going out that way. Jackpot! So you are or aren't full of shit? Shut the fuck up. I ran out of my prescription. - What's that? - Oxy-moron. It's good for the pain. - Want one? - I'm good. Okay. Now I'm ready. Let's go, smartass. Okay. - Wait, wait, wait... - What? - Where we going? - Oh... apartment 44A. Ex-DEA agent lives there. He's armed to the teeth. He's like a survivalist. If we're gonna stand any kinda chance at all, we need all the firepower we can get. Remember, shoot to kill, kid. I got your back. You got mine, alright? Here we go. Get the fuck in. Fuck. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Slowly. Now toss it. Come on. Don't you move or I'll blow your head off. Where's the old man? He's up my ass, you wanna tickle his feet? Come on. Can't get a shot. Wow! Oh, good. Come on. - You shot me! - Come on! Come on! I couldn't help it. You were in the way. Where the hell did they go? Did you see? You're kidding me. I couldn't see anything. You're supposed to be my eyes, kid. Okay, watch out. Hey, hey! Don't. I got a key. Are you fucking kidding me? This guy's a friendly. I think it's this one. Yeah, there you go. Everything I told you, right? Huh? One-stop shopping, ladies and gentlemen. Holy shit. Choose your weapon. Take your pick. You a Nazi? You don't like people like me. Oh, no, I... I don't... feel that way anymore. I didn't think there was no Nazis left. I guess there gotta be some. But they must be old as shit like your ass. Can you hold this? Bullet passed straight to the calf. Tibia, fibula clear. Lucky me, huh? No... I'm a good shot. Yeah... Yeah, one Thanksgiving, my dad... he went out and bought a bunch of frozen turkeys. Not for eating them. But he brought them home to just shoot the fuck out of them all. Just filled those birds up with lead. Just... Target practice. And I was really excited, 'cause... I always wanted to be a doctor. And I loved it 'cause... I got to pick all the bullets out of the birds and... stitch up all the holes. Wow. So what were you and my dad really talking about downstairs? Well... I used to be on the detective squad out in New York. Real busy. Never a down moment. I loved it. And, uh, I hear a call for a gun run one night. And, uh, I'm close, like four blocks away. I don't even hesitate. Take it. But I'm with Jasmine. Uh, she's my, um... I get it. That's actually just down the way from here. Come on, baby, please... She asked me not to take the call. Jasmine was a cop, too, But I told her, you know, stay in the car at home. And to call for backup. I'll take care of it. So I go in there. I see a barrel. I amped up, I squeeze the trigger... And I'm just... Jasmine. Where was the guy with the gun? There was no gun. Hey! - You call this in? - Yeah. You have any weapons? I'm gonna search... This asshole just called in a fake gun run 'cause he figured that we were taking too long to respond to his noise complaint. That's not on you, you know that. I know. But it happened to me, you know. I put her in that position. I always said I'd never hook up with a cop. What, why? Because of your father? Yeah, I'm not really that into kissing my dad, you know. Well, daddy issues, huh? He always wanted a boy. Troy. You really believe that? You met him. I did. Yeah. He's a fucking asshole, but... I also met you... and I'm pretty sure he doesn't think that. Well done. We'll have you back like you've never been shot before. God, you got the touch, Doc. Alright. - You're good. - Thank you. When we, uh, get out of here... do you, um... be open to... you know, helping me take these stitches out. I'm gonna need 'em out for sure. No, no, I'm... I'm serious. Like, uh... I'm... I'm very particular when it comes to making sure I get my stitches out and all that. - Oh, yeah. - You know, needles and such. Well, I am particularly good at that. I appreciate that. Anytime. Boss, you gotta see this. Ah, that looks nice. Nice Uzi, that's a good one. Have one of these. This could be handy. I like this little baby, here. Don't you want an M4, maybe a shotgun? Don't fucking move! Whoa, okay. So this is the spot? Why, you asking us or telling us? I'm asking, fuck-face. I'm just trying to clarify is all. Yes... This is the spot. Put your weapons on the floor. All right, nice and slow now. Make the man happy, sweetheart. Arms... arms up. Weapons on the floor, that's it. Nice and calm now. Okay. Okay? Ah, fuck. Fuck! - Hey. - Hey! Nice fucking work, kid. I think I got a spare hole here. Yeah, fuck. They opened me apart. Yeah, help me up. You lie down you die. Help me up. Okay. Okay. It's empty! It's fucking empty! I know it's fucking empty! Shut the fuck up! Okay. The old man knows where the art is. We find the old man, we find the art. - Let's go. - Let's go. You trained Janet to attack the police? Yeah. Why? I was walking home from work... and two cops, they stop me. Said I match a description to this robbery. I know what the description was. Black male... 18 to 40s, 5'6'' to 6'8''. I've been stopped like 20 times, and I didn't commit any robbery. I was sick of it. So I kept walking. Said a few choice words... pushed off of them. Next thing I knew I was waking up in the hospital. But I filed a notice of claim... sued the city... and got a big ass settlement and I moved down here. And I rescued Janet. Feels like dirty money. Like I took something that ain't belong to me. You know what I mean? I do. I do. Okay, Ray... Oh... Oh, that's a hole. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it was my fucking fault. I'm sorry. I was trying to do something to give us a shot. Shut the fuck up! Jesus. You did what you had to do, and you did good. - So hold it, alright? - I'm sorry. If we get outta this, I'll recommend you for any damn unit you want. Except Warrants. Fuck Warrants. Wow. That hurts. - Are you okay? - Okay, let's go. Okay... We'll go floor by floor until we find him. What happened to them? Well, he's not taking a nap. Alright, you ready? Not really, but, hey, what else are we gonna do? Where's my vest?

I'm okay, Cardillo. I'm sure you can see, we've hit a lull in the storm. Which gives us about 15 minutes to finish our business and safely exit. I would suggest for Officer Pena's sake, that you refrain from calling for back-up. Officer Cardillo... I haven't called. Then I'll keep this simple for expediency.
