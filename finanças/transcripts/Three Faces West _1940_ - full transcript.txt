Oh, that we the people now present. Dr. William Thorpe, head of the International Medical Association. Dr. Thorpe, Thank you. I speak for the Association's Committee for Refugee Doctors. Our purpose is to find professional openings in this country. For those physicians and surgeons who have been driven from their own countries. However, these gentlemen have no wish to compete with our own doctors in the medically well serviced metropolitan areas. But there are hundreds of towns and communities throughout rural America entirely without medical service. It is through such towns and hamlets that I am expressing this message. These men grateful for the sanctuary that America has afforded them in their hour of need, are prepared to accept posts in just these places and ask nothing beyond their actual living needs and the chance to be of service. The next voice you hear will be Dr. Rudolf Prysner, formerly of Prague. Dr. Prysner, You people out there Want two things to know. First, what kind of a doctor is this? Whose voice we hear. And second, is he a good doctor? The first question I answer quickly. I am a specialist in obstetrics. Eight years I do nothing but this. And very good success with a stroke. And the second question. Is he a good doctor? Can I answer that? Yes. Since I have great pride in my profession, I can't. Yes, I am a good doctor. I hope you will somewhere. Let me prove That I do not boast. Thank you, Dr. Prysner Now I present to you our most eminent specialist, Dr. Carl Braun of Vienna Doctor. There's so much that I would like to tell you about, Dr. Braun, that I honestly don't know where to begin. Perhaps I'd better just sum it all up by saying that 20 years ago, like many other American doctors, I journeyed to Vienna for the express purpose of taking post-graduate work under him and his famous clinic there. Dr. Braun, Ladies and gentlemen, I am more used to the stethoscope and ether cone than I am to the microphone. But it is not ethical that I expect you to buy me like a cat in a bag. Yes. No. So I tell you about myself. I am over 60. That is not very young. But it is not too old. Only last week I had to complete examination, which everyone should have at least twice a year. And they tell me I am sound. Yet in the more important parts. If one can believe doctors. For many years in Vienna, Diseases of the Bone and I worked most successfully, with children it has been my privilege to help many little cripples to walk again. Oh, yes, I forget. I am will fine Father. I must warn you, there are two of us. That means to expenses if you send for me. Naturally, we cannot separate. My daughter Linda and I, after all we have gone through together in Vienna. She was very gay. When Vienna was gay. But now she settles down to work by my side. She is studying to be a nurse and learning very fast and such a musician. You should hear her once play a Brahms concerto. Every note is like a kiss. WE THE PEOPLE= COLUMBIA BROADCASTING SYSTEM= NEW YORK CITY= HAVE WIRED RAILROAD FARES FOR DR. BRAUN AND DAUGHTER. SEND IMMEDIATELY. What a beautiful country. So lovely. We are lucky to. Thousand miles. We travel. No soldiers, do we see? No frontiers, do we cross? No custom house, no guards? America? Yes. And we are lucky, too, that we go to such small village. Large dirty cities, i don't like. The long land, turns at last. Leni. Here at last we find peace. Yes. How are you doing, folks? Fine. Fine. Beautiful scenery. What hour do we arrive at Ashville Fox. Still 9.40. and I have time to take a little nap. Yes, sure. Loads of it. We may not be on time anyway. I thought in America, everything is on time. This is not the super cheap buddy. This is just a branch line. Take one. Thanks. No, not without a little gin on the side. Oh, you put your feet up here. I'll just put this over you. Thank little Braun hand you personal, will you all, Papa, until it gets dark. I study it with my books. That is good. That chapter about to post operating technique. Mm. But it's hard to study when such a wonderful country runs past your window. What is not good, Lenchen. I know! He is gone. The world you knew together is gone. It is better not to look back. Look instead ahead Whit the eyes yes, but always the heart looks back. If only he could know how. All through my life I loved him. Never do I forget who sacrificed for us. Except for that, we would not be here. And he wouldn't be dead. We have each other, Lenchen. Our life begins again In a happy land, with happy people. Try to remember that. Also. Nice cozy night to work with strangers. There's. You're going to like it here. I'll bet you $10 it don't stay a week. Not that I got $10 or anybody else. This darn gas, just shut up. Remember the last one? I'll just get a good night's sleep, gentlemen, and start my rounds in the morning. How was the morning? Where is he? Over the hills and far away. I got to stay. It's a lot of sick people. And you keep your traps shut when they get here. Understand? None of your bellyaching. 30 years I've been telling this community. All of a sudden I'm not good enough. No. And d got to send for some burn pill dispenser with an empty PDQ with no back of his name. You're a vet knock, and you're okay with cows and horses and ordinary human ills. Things have been piling up around here that need real doctoring. Does pneumonia, fracture cases? My little girl and a pianist sit down and play drums like a kiss at. You call that doctoring? I don't mind. Here comes the train. Now, remember, keep your mouth shut and let me handle this. Go right ahead. But it's your picnic. Well, aren't you going to help me? Sure, sure. Well, I'm going out there and crank up the jalopy. I'm John Phillips. I sent the telegram Well, not a very pleasant night. Bit of a storm. I think it is a whole big storm. Is it like this all the time? No. This is very unusual. Well, I hope so. Well, this is my daughter, Lee. How do you do? She's a bloody son. Okay, Now, I'm Dr. Atterbury. He's a local vet. So may I call you my colleague? His colleague? Oh, yeah. I've been called worse than that. My time. Well, come on, folks. You better get your handkerchief. The whole town planed to turn out to give you a weapon. The wind kept them home. Insulation. But in many cases, only an epidemic. Well, we fixed up the house. Hope you like it. On the way of the cabins place He and his missus and two kids are laying up. I thought that was. Should be taken out of the bed. She's got you in the kitchen. Doctor, Are we... Pneumonia and hot picks on the stove. Doctor, But don't. Don't bother with me, my little girl. Best thing I can do for her, is get her mama well. Yeah. Spine, a very serious dislocation. But we fixed it. We put you on the table. No, no, no, no, no. You must not move. We fixed Another table, Please. What do you want another table for? He ain't that long. No, you take yourself. Please. He can't stand any. Just one more. Stop. So you have settled every house. Well, I haven't heard him complain. You know, these are all emergency cases. He is Grand old man, not a whole hospital staff. He'll never complain. He's a doctor. He can't say no, But his daughter can. And I'm ordering you to take this home. But Lee. No, no, This is too much. Each hous he take us to, is dirtier and badder than the last. Don't get excited, Leni. Who lives here? You, your brother. This is your house. Dirtier and badder than the last. Who do you think has the Empress of Russia? Not much of a house, I'll admit. We tried to fix it up for you. Werden wir hier leben? Er der her vi skal bo? das is ein hund for schimheit. det er en hund til at skamme sig over What she's squawking about. Excuseble, she's very tired. I know you're both fall in, but this show, your what's what, and then we'll leave you. Now, get the stuff out of the car. Put it away. She's put right now, son. I'm not going to break my arm. Crank it up again. You live near here, too? This is my house. But don't worry. We've moved upstairs. Got our own private entrance and everything from by your bed. This is all yours. Here, I'll show you the layout. Find the beds are made up all nice and fresh. And there's plenty of clean towels in the bathroom, Lady. And the women both fixed up some food and stuff. It Little dusty? Yeah, but milk, that's one thing. We have nothing else out here is good milk. How would you like a nice glass of sour? Well, anyway, we got good running water First. Have to strain it through a towel or something. That's what we do. Be all right in a couple of days. I'll show you how this stove works. Oh, no, no, please. Not tonight. I've seen too much already. Don Gaston. He's my age. A bellhop for farmers. All right. Now, hit the hay. You're dying to. So long, folks. Before I turn in. There's something I'd like to say. It's been a tough night for you and your both swell. I'll mighty thankful. Can you see what we're up against, Doc? Yes. Yes. Things are very bad. Oh, this is hard. How can people live in such filth? Oh, you're going to be all right when we get this dust cleared away. It isn't going to be as hard as you think. I guess we don't notice it so much. We're kind of used to it. You'll feel better after a night's rest. Sleep works wonders, doesn't it, doc? What dit she say? Forgive her, please. She's very tired. I know you understand. We speak about it tomorrow. Yes, I know. She's had a tough night, but. No, no, no. You've been very, very kind and thoughtful. Good night Good night, doc. Oh, what are you listening for, not Santa Claus. Well, what did they tell you? They're going to pull out tomorrow. I tell you, I heard them say so. They are down there now. Oh, come away from there. It's mostly that that foreign double talk anyway. But now and then a slip in a word of English. They'll be gone tomorrow. My name ain't Albury. The old geezer is willing to give it a go, but the Empress of Russia said don't take what I'm up the jalopy knock. I'll see if they're ready for church. They ain't listening for no church bells, son. They're getting ready for the choo choo. Good morning! Good morning. Ready for church? I am sorry, Mr. Phillips, But we think it more better that we do not even go to church with you. Oh, but everybody's waiting to meet you. The whole town's turned out to see the new doctor. I know. Don't think too bad of us. We are not going to stay, we can't ah but Leni. Today we go. But doctor. It's hardly fair to judge us by last night. You know it won't always be like that. Please, Mr. Phillips, Do not plead with him. He would gladly kill himself or others. But I will not let him. We would like to do what is right. But. Well, we can't chain you here. It's a free country. He is right Leni. It is where we should remember. Goodmorning, folks. As she blows pop. I do. Now, come on, son. Let's you and I listen to the sermon after that storm. The minister always preaches a rip slaughter. It is settled. After all, it is just a courtesy. Yeah. We go to church and we try to explain to the good people here why we cannot remain. It is inscrutable wisdom that Lord has seen fit to strike us, terrible storm. It is not from us to complain. He moves in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform. The Lord may have said this tribulation applies to test your faith. And there are some among us who feel that we have a superabundance of these testing. But after what we went through last year. And be that as it may, faith alone will not take root of it. We will need courage in our hearts and shovels in your heart. Today on this Black Sabbath, our sun is shining. Well, the storm blown itself out. Let us pray that we likewise may have the vision that and sorrow from our hearts. Blown away last night came into our midst. A stranger. And if we need an example of true courage and helpfulness, it has already been said by him. I, brethren, the Lord, do prayers. We ask for a doctor. And He sent us not only a doctor, but a man. Last night, when the storm was holding, he came into our midst, tired and worn out by a trip across the continent. And we are waiting even for a good desired. He probably gave succor to those who were shall our bishop. I speak of Dr. Carl Braun, who sits among you and old Omen subversives of all over you are all an impartial. We give thanks to the law that he sent us such a man and these fine young doctors to help us. May they remain with us always honored by all and blessed by God. Amen, amen.. When the minister is alone, you tell him yet. Please listen to me. Papa, do you want me to tell him. What, I am glad to see you. Reverend, you sure are hitting on all cylinders today. Dr. Brown. Good morning, Dr. Brown. I heard you was a great surgeon. If you could just take a look at my boy. Don't want no more doctors. Look at me no more. Hey, Nunk, wait for me. Hey, Nunk. What is it, old timer? He don't have to limp like that. all he's life? is he doctor? He could be made to walk good again. I would have to examine him first. It is possible that an operation. It is possible, Doctor. I know. I had him to a clinic once and the fellow said that he could be cured by an operation. And why didn't you take? We didn't have the money for the hospital's doctor. We ain't got none now. But you could look at him and you could do it. You said over the radio that she was put near always successful with children. I found you was coming here. I felt it was an answer to my prayers. I already told Billy that you could fix him up, But I haven't even examined him yet. But you will, Doctor. Oh, poor little fella. He's scared of doctors. There's been a couple of them that fooled around and hurt him. And didn't do no good. But I had told him you was a great surgeon. Come all the way from Vienna just to make him well. But you could operate on him, Doctor. You can make him good again. You can do it easy. Oh. Oh. All right, all right. I will look him over. Thank you, Doctor. Thank. And nothing be done about this terrible dust. No, Just wait till the wind lets up and dig ourselves out like they're all doing. Are we ready to go now? I'll have a look at the boy. It'll only take a hour. But you said, What can I do, the mother begged me? I'll only be an hour. - All right. Shall I wait here? No. Perhaps you drive Leni home? Sure. Glad to. Thank you very much. I don't mind. Your father, like to have me drive you around a bit so I get your bearings. I'm afraid there wouldn't be time. I still have some packing to do. Havent change your mind, huh? No. You're heard what the minister said about your father. Yeah. I didn't cut any ice either. Ice? I didn't know what you mean. I mean, that didn't make any difference. I'm sorry. It's no use, really. We are going. What was the name of that radio program? You were? Oh, you mean "We the people"? Yeah. "We the people". left holding the bag. Bag? Skip it. You are angry with us? Disappointed? Oh, I don't blame you. But look, let's not talk about it, so. But I want you to understand. You need here a younger man than my father. There was a younger man on the air just ahead of you. A lot of folks around here figured we ought to send for him. But I said send for the older man with his daughter. I guess you might be some help. Oh! Forget it. I'm not going to try and sales talk you. I'm staying. I'll even help you pack up. What kind of a car is this? Jalopy? Jalopy an Italian car. Yeah. First cousin John, this other friend, she was. That is the kind of automobile we have in Vienna. Can you drive? Oh, no. We have a chauffeur. Oh, fritzy, hva'.. No, his name was Fritz. Oh. Oh, I say something funny. Yeah, Yeah. I used to like. Oh, I almost passed. I wish that my father would not be late. Just can't wait to beat it. Can you. Beat it? You're going to stick around. I teach you the American language. What's the use? You're going to scram anyway. You can only take it like the old gent. Take? Yeah. See that? But she's sweet. Who is she? My grandmother. She came out here in 61. By covered wagon. Our indians divide then and dangers and famine, to me. Little dust couldn't run her out. She could take it. She was a pioneer. Yes, but when you are a refugee, it is different. The pioneers have everything to gain. We have lost everything. Well, I figured you stopped being a refugee when you came through Ellis Island. There's no reason why you can't start being a pioneer now, even in a dust bowl and used to be topsoil, good, rich, earth, fine stuff to have your roots in. If you had any roots. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how you must feel. I don't altogether blame you for wanting to pull out, but I wish you'd give it a try. For maybe a week or ten days. You've no idea. Not a week. Not ten days. Not even one day. We go. If you only... It is no use to argue That you're asking me. I'm not asking you. You see, my friend, the surgery is very cute, But underlying the paralysis, there's a definite psychosis. You don't say psychosis. Now where would a kid pick up a foreign disease like that? Papa, you are ready to go now, yes? Please Lenchen at one moment. Now, Dr. Atterbury. I will need all the things on this list by 8:00 tomorrow morning. Today, it's Sunday, brother. Drug store is a shut like a clam. I am certain all doors will be opened to you, Dr. Atterbury. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, Colleague, leave it to me. It is a very interesting case. A little crippled boy. I have a case exactly like him in 23. The prognosis is identical. It is a partial paralysis. All right, Papa, you tell me all about it on the train. Yes, yes. You see... What train? Papa, We are leaving today. No, we are not leaving today. I promised the mother I operate tomorrow. But that means we have to stay. For how long? Oh, perhaps a week. Ten days. It is no use to argue. I said something funny, Perhaps. No, doctor. Must be an echo in this room. Echo!? Easy Now, doctor, Easy. Oh, don't worry. He came through. Fine. Keep him well covered. You may be a foreigner, but he sure knows he's onions. You help me like a nurse of ten years experience. He will walk again, Yes? Of course I do this many times. He will walk again soon. And without a brace. I would like to see that. Well, perhaps, as Mr. Phillips says, we stick around. And maybe we see him walk, yes? And there are ways to look at this thing, man. Irrigation ditches, windbreaks contour plowing. Others have done it and saved their land. And so can we. And there's no guesswork about it. It's all right here in black and white from the Department of Agriculture. Listen, John, I ain't got nothing again. All them pamphlets. But what I want to know is this. Can the Department of Agriculture bring us maybe six inches of rain? I wish they could, But if we did what they told us, We might learn how to use what little rain we do get. These plans have been drawn up by experts. They know our problems. There no college professors are going to teach me how to farm my land. How much land you got left that hasn't blown away Look man. Let's quit arguing and kidding ourselves. We're all in the same boat. We're all going to sink unless we stick together. Every one of us has been served with a dispossess notice. Not by Uncle Sam or a bank or some mortgage company, but by a little old gal. We've been kicking in the teeth. Mother Nature. Oh, we've had enough talk. How about getting some work done? Are you going to pitch in and help? Well, we can try it. Oh, count me in to. Me first, Mary. We're all digging ditches, like you said, but I'd feel better if it cloud up some. We'll have rain. We've got to have rain. Oh, take a year to plow this under. Unless we can borrow some tractors. Well, what do you think? I'm going to Harrisburg for? To see the movies. Don't let the heat get down collerbuttom. Attaboy. Nunk. Every little drop helps Tell a Department of Agriculture not to send us any more bullet. No, no more bull. Get at them. Panthers are raining on us. Ain't got no moisture. Good morning. Morning, Leni. Gees, You're up kind of early, aren't you? - Oh look out, sir? - What is that? You have long. Drive ahead of you. So I fixed you something to eat on the way. Oh, that's very nice of you. Thanks. Today will be another, how do you say.. a scorcher. Yeah, Fright, So. There is a God of rain. So I try and pray to him. Send it special delivery, will you Leni? Here's what we tryed on the side of that hill. Yes, I know. I got a report on it from one of our field men. Yeah, but according to your pamphlet, Now look Phillip. Perhaps the trouble with you farmers is that you're always too late. I'd say in your case, about 20 years too late. Well, now, I don't doubt that you've all been sweating blood, But all this isn't going to help. Now look Mr.. Our land means a lot to us. Your land is located in this sector, which the government considers doomd. I didn't hear. Not even what Safe Doomd! What do you mean? Well, doomd, man doomd. That's plain, english isn't it? I mean, it's worn out, worked out, buried. The next dust storm will blow whatever topsoil is left, even on the best of these farms. Clear out of the country. That's what you think? Is the considered opinion of our experts. There's just one thing that you fellows can do if you're smart. What, for instance, breaking your backs and your heart's trying to hold back a desert. Move off the land. Look here. There is an enormous dam being built right here. There are great tracts of fertile soil just waiting for settlers. There'll be cheap power. Yeah, I know all about the dam, but that's in Oregon. We're 1500 miles from there. We'll help you. We'll see. Now. Are you crazy, Mr.. You think you're talking to a sharecropper? We're farmers. We own our own land like our fathers and grandfathers. You can't shove us around a match. Pretty pins on your maps. We're not Swivel chair farmers, and we're not like Chet Same thing? You're of Nashville folks, aint you? Aren't you fellas pretty bad down there? Yeah. Hey, fellas! Winds blown up again ain't. You, Ain't able to drive back to your apartment, mister. Are you? Sure, in about 2 hours. Why not? Same time as they staying put, Let the wind blow your power back to you. Oh, HA, HA, HA. Anybody else think it's funny? Did you hurt yourself? No, I'm all right. But the barn It that much easier for the wind, to blow down. If you want to see my father. He's out with Atterbury. See. I make curtains for the kitchen. I'll be a sucker. Don't waste your time. Why don't you pack your things and clear out? You and your old man had the right hunch When you first got here, you want to pull out the same day? Well, I'm sorry. I ever talked you in to staying? I will make you some very hot, very strong and very black. Coffee. I'm not so drunk. I don't know what I'm saying. They showed me maps and charts of our land today. It isn't worth saving, See. I do not believe that. Well, I do. I know when I'm late. Move off the land, the fellas said, it's dead. And, it is dead. We're all dieing on our feet and haven't got sense enough to know it. Well, Why don't you clear out while the clearance good? We will be following you, pretty soon anyway. It is you talk like a refugee now. That's right. That's what they want us to be. I want to move us to Oregon. You are ordered to go. It is a law. No, We can stay here and.. Starve, I guess. Can you not stay and go on fighting for your land like you've been doing? I haven't seen you like this before. You didn't talk like this when you told me about the Pioneers. I was giving you a pep talk. You know what that means? Yes, I have learned that. And I give you one now. And it is better for you even than black coffee. You are the leader here. All these farmers, they look to you to do what you say. They feel what you feel. Now, if there is no law which makes you move. Our law is written by the wind. The dust. It's rain. It's rain. It's rain. Lightning. Honest to God. You feel it? I don't like the colors of the Stupid charts. It feels like rain. It's sweating. Cool. I cried. Listen, Leni, I can almost hear the earth drinking it up. I don't hear anything with my heart beating. Oh, you're getting drenched, you better go in. It fells good, I like it. So do I. Who is that Rain god, Leni? Stupid, obvious. Yeah, that's a fella. Keep her goin to pour boy. Keep her going. It will be all right Now this will save our land. Our land. As you say, I have begone to take root. Darling. I've done some stacking in my time, but gosh darn it, I always had sense enough to coming out of the rain. This is wonderful. What the rain or, the foolishness, the both. And it isn't foolishness, is it? I guess I'm going to find out what happens to a fellow. When he's kissed a girl right under her father's nose. Better find out what happens when you kiss the girl under her own nose. You were surprised to see us kissing in the rain. Kissing no.. In the rain? Yes. You want to start out with pneumonia? You don't think he'll catch cold? If I know anything about my colleague Dr. Atterbury - He has by now prescribed for him a large... What is it? Oh, yes, a large lug of rye. Oh, Papa he's so... He's so... Yes, yes, I know. He is so wonderful. You are so wonderful. It is also wonderful. And now I tell you my wonderful news. It is from one of the greatest clinics in America. They want me to join their staff. But this came a week ago. I remember it. Why didn't you tell me? Because then I was not certain. If you want to live here. Now, I am certain you want to remain. You are not going to refuse such a splendid chance. No, no. But there is no hurry. They give me 90 days to consider. So I wait until you are married. Yes. It is nice listen to that rain? I think it sounds so beautiful. I say come again The rain, you hear it. A Symphony Orchestra, - - Couldn't make sweeter music than that. What? What say? I said the rain on the roof is lovely to hear. Can't hear a word you say in the kind of the thing it rain. Oh, oh I'm glad, I'm not in love.. Good day. Good day, Dr. how are you? Good morning. Billy. Don't worry. I ran 15 ball 40 years ago. Oh, yeah? Yes, sir. I. Hello, doc? Glad to see you. - Have a glass of beer. - Yeah, sounds good. Hey, Nunk, your shot. Hold your horses will yeah. Doc, come on over here. Go up a chair and learn something. Yes, sir. They are laying prety for you. Nunk. Oh, nothing to it. Huh? Huh? Oh. Oh. Huh? Why not make both balls. Both balls? Well, maybe Doc thinks he can make it. I said all right. They are all your brother. Then I'll try. Hey, you don't hold a cue. You'll never make it that way. You know what?... I'll be darn. Please. Well, my father, he all right about that boy around? I didn't well hit him. Put it in that corner. Sorry, boy. I haven't played in several years. Doc, when did you ever find time to study medicine? Well, doc, when's the wedding going to be? Two weeks from Sunday. Your daughter's got a fine young fella. - They don't come any better than John. - We're very happy about. Oh, hi doc. that saves me a trip. Got a letter for you. Thank you. A lot of foreign stamps on it, too. If I could have them, maybe. My kid he collect it. Not much of a hobby on my way of thinking. But if it's good enough for Roosevelt. Well, it's good enough, my kid. Hey, doc, it's you're shot. Will you finish for me, please? I have to go home. But how can we be sure that is true? They told us Eric was killed. But it is true, Lenchen. You read in the letter. Dr. Tubb. saw him in Russia. He escaped. Thank God. We owe him our lives, Lenchen. I know, I too say thank God. But I feel wicked and horrible for in my heart I cannot be happy. What should I do, Papa? How shall I tell John? He knows, I told him. He understands. - But you don't understand... - But Lenchen. You loved Eric. You were to have been married. I know, but that was two years ago. In another life in another world. I know how you feel, Lenchen. It is not easy to know where loyalty ends and love begins. It's like someone returns from the grave. They cannot help you. Perhaps when Eric comes to America. he will understand. He risked everything for us. We owe him our lives. I will always remember that. And try not to get Lenchen: I had to go out on a late call. Do not wait up for me. Papa. Don't do that, Leni. Don't cry. Was sitting at my room for hours trying to figure this thing out. It still seems all wrong. I know, but try to understand. We'd be a lot better off, you and I, Leni, without so much understanding. We got all tangled up in other people's feelings. But duties and obligations. We know where our happiness lies. Why don't we take it? Perhaps because we know it's not altogether ours. yeah, well, just something like a fight. But I can't. It's like that storm outside. How long before he gets here? His boat gets to San Francisco next month. Send him a cable. Tell him you've changed your mind. Tell him it's too late. Tell him we're already married. Tell him anything. How can I? Go ahead, Leni. You want to? He'll never know. No, John, we would. Please, go on up. Please don't stay anymore. Oh, Leni? You are not kind, you are not fair. - I beg you to go. - I only want to. Oh, you want to comfort me? I know, but you cannot. We only make each other more unhappy. Darling, please, Please go. I make no secret that I love you. And I cannot fight against you any more than you can fight against him or the wind and go both crazy to let a ghost come between us. He's not a ghost. Look, this is Eric. He's alive. What a comfort you to hear that I hate him. It would be a lie, it's my fiancé. I loved him. He's fine and brave. And without him, my father would have been dead. You will. You're a lucky guy. And ladies and gentlemen, this is coming to you directly from the very heart of the stricken area. I'm looking down the main street of Asheville Parks where the storm hit the hardest. And believe me, it looks like an earthquake hit this place rather than just a dust storm. In a few moments, I'll let you hear some of the actual voices of the people who lived through these past few days of devastation. You will hear history in the making. Asheville porters packing up lock, stock and barrel and moving on up into Oregon. How about you, sir? Would you say a few words for listening audience about this great trek that you're contemplating? I ain't no Charlie McCarthy. I ain't got time. It'll only take a moment. Just tell us, in your own words about your experiences during this calamity, In my own words, yes. All right. You ask for it, brother. Well, the wind was howling like a...... Thank you very much. That's very graphic indeed. I call him as I see him, Brother, Quiet, What if we don't feel like hitting the trail for Oregon? What if we figure our land here is still good? Happy to look at it, James, but I aim to grow on it. Seaweed. Well, we can. We can always stay here and go on relief. Why not? Other people are doing it. That's right. You can do that. There's no compulsion in this. But as long as we have to move off the land, let's move like an army and not like gravel. Let's make it an advance, not a retreat. I don't want to go any more than the rest of you. Only a few months ago was I that argued that we stay here and fight. Well, we fought and lost. That patch on the map is Oregon. That's 1500 miles from here. And that's a long haul in any man's country, but it's new land. And if we got together, stick together and work together and pull our moneys and supplies, we can make it. That's fine, John. But what about our livestock? What are we going to put trackers? We it up to Oregon. And how much land do they give us and what are we going to use for money? So we've got to take your word for it, John, that this year Oregon is a land flown with milk and honey, huh? There's no land anywhere worth a hoot. Let's float with good, honest sweat. That's telling them Bob. I would like to say a few words, if you will permit me. Go ahead Doc. I'm speaking as one who knows what it means to be a refugee. Ain't no fair and are going to tell me where to go. I'm Higgins. You've got a short memory. You didn't talk that way the night you come out of the house. How's your kid's appendix bursted? No, sir, it was. Please, then, won't you come Doc? And he did come in the middle of the night. Please, please. I do not know your farm problems. So well as John, but I do know that he is right. I think it is wiser for you to argue less and start packing. It's no skin off his nose. He ain't going.. Out of my way, colleague. Let me spit these high on a spit. Who's not I blabbermouth know everything, don't you? Ain't no secret, Nunk. Now we all know he's joining up with a big clinic back east. he is in a pigs eye for that storm hit us. He was going to take that job, but now he says no. So he's willing to go with us to Oregon. That don't sound like any foreigner to me. All those in favor are going to Oregon. Say I I!! You got to have note when you call me. Hey, Joe, All, mighty God. All the relevant mercy. We beseeks speed of bless and guide this caravan of life, people. checking out on a long journey to a promised land. Now lord knows that many of the cars that are - in a deplorable condition. Afflict not they people further with - Blow out, Burnt bearings, a broken aksel, Prosper them all lord on their new lands. Then they along they may send for us who are remaining here. Sending thy goodwill. Amen! Amen. And here comes our brave leader. I hope he knows what he's doing. All this refugees when we were leaving Vienna, our future was greater. We were coming to America. For these people, there must be a more tragic word, wretched. Take a look at that line of cars and trucks with you. These are the day number one. Next oldest brother that moses himself, could not don any better. Did he have to worry about two cars? Spare tire, gasoline? No, sir. He had a sense compared to John. He's doing a fine job. He's carrying a great load on his shoulders. Yep. Needs all the help he can get to. Eat his heart out about. Well, something none of my business. Please, Nunk. Oh, I was thinking of another young fella. He had a big job, threw it up. Said he could make the grade without the help of the woman he loved. Sure. Hope John don't abdicate. Leave this outfit in a heck of a shape. Are you going to ride with us most of the way, Nunk? I can take hint sister drop me off the next stop. I ride one of the other cars. Well, sir, I started in a subtitle like way. I gave her the wink and I said, Let me drive the bus, Leni. Why don't you go forward and ride with John for a while? She never batted a nightlife. And I started to warm up and I gave her a great sale to talk about you. A lollapalooza, but still no dice. Why don't you mind your own business? Leave her alone cant ya? I can take it or leave it, but can you? No female worth grieving over? Well, who's grieving over? Shut up! To think of anything else to talk about. Yes, plenty. I was writing with Higgins in the outfit today, That fellow's doing a lot of talking. Whats eating him now. Same old thing. California. The land of the golden sunshine. He's telling them all he ought to head west instead of north. Well, he's welcome to go, and good riddance. Yep. But the trouble is he and Amy did go by himself. He's trying to split up this outfit. But if you and I said to him, I said, You'll have to record my nephew John, purse his kit, the prune juice and a bigger weasel than you That held him. Heard you wanted to talk to me. Yeah. When I ask you to quit making trouble. Listen, Mr.. Just because you're in the lead car, don't prove you're running the whole shebang as a lot of fellows think. The way do. Now, what do you know about that? I know the one rotten apple can spoil a barrel. I'll just stay in line and quit shooting off your mouth. And when camp tonight, if you've got anything to say, I'll listen to you. I don't have to take orders from you. You're a fool, Higgins. And this isn't my show. It's ours. I didn't ask to run it, but as long as I am runing it, you're going to take orders from me and like it Anyways, in California, they don't freeze to death. There's sunshine out there, - and miles of orchards and orange groves and plenty of work picking fruit. His wife's cousin sat in a big orange once. And ever since that had been yapping. California, California. What do you know about it? And you ain't never been there? No, but I have. Sure, there's miles of groves and orchards, but there's also about two or 300,000 migratory workers there. There isn't enough fruit for them to pick to make a living wage. Sure, we can go to California, but what good let do us? We'll just become migrants to. Drift up and down the state following the crops. We're not fruit pickers, man. We're farmers. And up in Oregon, where we're heading for there's land for us. Land we can own and farm There is a road due west from here, Higgins. To your oranges and sunshine. Take it any time you want to, but quit stirring these people up. You ain't going to bulldoze me without high and mighty talk. We're getting out of here. But not before you hand over that dough, we chipped in. One dime, Higgins. You know what that money's for? I suppose it wouldn't be for that little foreign dish that strutting around your back. A bull's eye. That was built right on his kisser. It stubborn, stupid fools. Come my impetuous young Moses.. If you know your Bible, you will remember. The children of his few had trouble in the wilderness 40 centuries ago. Then they worship the golden calf. Now they worship a golden orange or a golden mirage. Well, if I remember correctly, Doc. Moses got good and sore at them too. Yes. And he was punished. He was allowed to see the promised land, but he never set foot in it. Well, that'll be okay with me too, Doc. My heart won't be hurt. One minute a guy freezes and another minute he frie, which is very generous to California. He won, I think. I think they just cockeyed. They got all that snow up there, the hills where they don't need it. Why don't they send them down here to desert, where to be as welcome as gravy and potatoes. This is the worst stretch yet. They better be. We've run out of money and we go out further. Now. I got a right to stay here. We're going to settle this right now, Mr. Phillips. No stalling. We want our dough and our supplies. And we don't want no part of Oregon. We sure don't. How about it, man? Right now, listen, man, We've driven all day through a furnace. We've only just made camp. You're hot and tired and hungry. Go on back to your tents and let the women feed you. Take a swim, cool off. We can get there. All right, Higgins, you win. You lead them. Lead them wher're not wantd, lead them where they all starve. Lead them into the middle of Death Valley and let them rot for all I care. Where's our dough? Your'll get it. Keep their hands off of that and ain't all yours. You're not going to give this to them, son. You're not going to quit us now. I've taken all I can stomach. That's the money. Do what you like with it, John! What's the matter? What is happening? That Promised Land is on that Fred Doc.. And I don't want to see it. This money belongs to all of us and everybody to get the share. If you give me a chance, Hang on this Joe. Bill, get them trucks. Say, buddy, it's going to take us a couple of hours sort this stuff. We ain't going sort it. We'll take it the way it is. Hold on a minute. This ain't all ours. We can't do that. Oh, time's up. I'm running this outfit, brother. But anybody here doesn't like it. Just let me know. Is anything wrong? No, everything's just dandy. - I was just taking a walk, - And I was just taking a powder. Small world, isn't it? I don't know what you mean. I mean, I'm clearing out. - I'm quitting. - I'm through - Is that clear? - Yes. Where are you going? What difference does that make? We don't take the same road. San Francisco is less than 200 miles from here. It's a clear day, Leni. Maybe you can see the Golden Gate. It's not a clear day for me, John. I'm seeing things through a mist. What are we kidding ourselves for? Why don't you quit, too? There's a lot of things stronger than duty, and we're both crazy if we don't realize it. I want to run away, John, but I can't any more than you. It's easy to run away. I just found that out. I It'll be easy for you, too. It's time we started thinking about ourselves for a change and not others. Grab this chance to be free Leni. It'll never come again. Turn that car back, you yellow livered coot. Higgins has turnd the camp wide open. That's okay with me and the lady, Let them stew in your own juice, we're calling it a day. You let him talk like this Leni. Answer me. Perhaps it is you who make him act and talk so. You're all wrong, Doc It's the other way around. I'm trying to sell her a bill of goods. How about your people, John. They don't mean a thing to me. You have no right to say that John. Back there are 200 men, women and children, whose lives are just as much your sacred responsibility, as a patient on the operating table. Maybe that patient isn't worth saving that. Is not true, John. But even if it were, doctors don't tell their patients there is no hope. No, a doctor does not always skib out. I am tired.. I will call it a day. He does not quit. He fights. That is telling him, colleague. Yes.. you could run away, but you could not escape. You could shout I am free. But even the echo would know you were lying Leni knows that? Look at her, John. She knows that duty is sometimes bitter and hard and cruel. She knows that better than you, John. You look into her eyes, You have a job to finish, John. So, has Leni. All right, I'll catch him. John. Catch him. You just sing that song. He gave me the kiss. Did it? Stop your talking. That looks like George car. Don't look back, son. She's just... There's plenty to look ahead for the all them hills Lies Oregon. Auf Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen. Here we are Saint George Hotel. Do you think this is the right place Papa? That's what the council said. But I didn't expect to find Eric such affluence. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Hr. Doctor. Good afternoon, My fraulein. Is this Dr. Eric Von Scherer apartment? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Bitte schön. Where is Dr. Von Scherer? I will tell him that you are here. Lenchen! Eric! And Doctor! Hello. It's so good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Nor, you. It's good to see you, Eric. Setzen, Lenchen. Oh, but maybe to present my assistant, Hr. Schmidt. Oh, uh, do sit down, Eric, and, uh, tell us about your escape. But I didn't escape, Lenchen. But we heard that you had escaped to Russia. I was in Russia, yes. On a mission for the state. Dr. Tauber said in his letter that you.. I regret to say that Dr. Tauber is a traitor. He will write no more letters. But Eric. Dr. Tauber was one of our oldest friends. How is he a traitor? To the Reich doctor, of which I am now an official servant. But you risk your life, But we could escape. Two years ago, I too had soft and sentimental ideas. As you will remember hr. doctor. Now I have learned a different ideology. I hardly know you, Eric. I have important business here for two weeks. Then I return to Berlin. The Reich is acquiring new territory hr. doctor. There's work for us to do. I've made arrangements for you and Leni. Us? Have no fear. I have influence in the party. I have arranged this, little difficulty of yours is forgotten. And then we will return to the Reich. No, Eric! You are mistaken. Our home is now in America. Ridiculous. Does the fatherland not mean nothing to you? The fatherland? Yes. But you are Reich, No! It is incredible, Eric. You look so perfectly healthy, and yet you have become infected with the disease. More horrible and malignant than cancer. The disease that would be fatal to you, and millions of your countrymen, and to the whole Reich. Don't waste your sympathy on the Reich, hr. Doctor. For doomd patient. We are not doing so badly. How many times have you sat by a sickbed, Eric. and seen such an outburst of energy, just before the death rattle. Come Leni? We will go on to Oregon. Leni! You cannot leave like this. We have traveled half across the world to meet here. Yes, Eric. And now that we meet, we do not even speak the same language. Almighty God. In the shelter of this, thy tree or temporary tempel We ask thy bleshing, and thy mercy. We ain't had time to build a church, Lord. Now understand is was more important. to build barns, silos and homes. But in our hearts, our grateful heart is thy Eternal temple. We thank you for this rich soil, which you has led us, and for the strong and willing arms. And she news we which it shall be made fruitful and productive. And now our Lord. The stand before the, two of thy servants. this man and this woman, who in thy sight and in the presence of this congregation, As I perform this sacred matrimony.
