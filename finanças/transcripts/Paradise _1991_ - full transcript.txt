(DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES) (KEYS JINGLING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (BELL RINGS) (CHILDREN'S VOICES) (THUDDING OF FOOTSTEPS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) CLAY: Gee, sorry, Willard. (HORN HONKS) No problem. Hey, where are you going this summer, Clay? I'm going to my summer house in Colorado. Where are you going? Africa. Africa? Yeah, Africa. Well, see you in September unless you get eaten by lions. CLAY: Hey, Nevan! Wait up! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CHILDREN'S VOICES) BOY: Hey batter... BOY: Hey, look who's here. It's the faggot. (WILLARD PANTING) ROSEMARY: No, I didn't say that in the first place. You said that. No. Okay, I'll call you. Why not? Yeah, but why? Hold on. (MUFFLED VOICE) Louis Marcazano's mother had a baby, and she didn't send him away. You're not being sent away, you're being sent on a vacation. I don't want to have to go through all this again, please. Thank you. MAN: (OVER PA) Bus 502 to Akron... (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS) Now boarding, gate number 10. (ANNOUNCEMENT CONTINUES) (BIRDS CALLING) ROSEMARY: Wake up, Willard. Wake up, Willard. We're here. Where? Paradise. This is it? (SIGHS) This is it, and that's that. I'm tellin' you, Ben. When it comes to men, I have been getting it all wrong. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I mean, look at me. Here I am. I'm over 28... And I'm raising two fatherless daughters on a waitress's salary. I mean, not that I regret having Billie or Darlene. I don't. They may be the direct result of nothing more than physical attraction, but they are my family. I know I can't change the powerful effect I have on men. That'd be like asking the sun to rise in the west. (LAUGHING) But I can change what I get from them, so... I have decided on getting married. You're kidding. To who? Well... I don't know. I just thought of it this morning. Excuse me? Do you know how to get to Crofter's Road from here? (EXHALES DEEPLY) Go out that door and make a left, then down to the church and make another left. That's Crofter's Road. Okay, thanks. BEN: What's on Crofter's Road? I'm visiting some people named Reed. Oh, the Reeds, huh? You know 'em well? No. Do you know 'em? Yeah, I know 'em. (HESITATES) Well... Don't you like 'em? BEN: No, I don't. Not anymore. I used to. (SIGHS) They've changed a lot. For the better? BEN: No, for the worse. If you're lucky, your visit will be a short one. ROSEMARY: Lily! Rosemary! Oh, Lily! Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Oh, I can't believe it's you after all these years. You look exactly the same. Well... Well... Here, let me take that. Willard. This is my oldest friend, Lily Reed. Hi. Hi. LILY: Do you want sugar in your tea? ROSEMARY: No. Thanks. Just some lemon. Here, let me do something. I'm sitting here while you're doing all that work. LILY: Exactly. You're my guest. So just relax and tell me all about your life while I fix us a nice lunch. LILY: He didn't touch his food. Doesn't he like chicken? ROSEMARY: Oh, he likes chicken. I'm not sure he likes the country yet. (LILY CHUCKLES) (WATER RUNNING) I'm so happy to see you, Rosie. I really wish that you lived closer. Remember all those afternoons that we spent at the Belle Queen Diner? Smoking your uncle Tony's cigarettes? Having fantasies about Danny Spellman? (LAUGHING) Oh, my God! Danny Spellman... I can't believe how in love with him we were. Yeah, I know. But we couldn't help it. He was the only criminal that we knew. (LAUGHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Have you ever seen a dead body? If you were trying to scare me, you didn't. I knew you were there. So, have you? Seen dead bodies? Yeah. Lots of times. I don't believe you. Where? Where I live. It's a tough neighborhood. People kill each other all the time. You mean, in the street? Yeah, all over the place. I've only seen dead bodies through the basement window of the funeral parlor. Nothing exciting ever happens around here. Unless you count when Esther Piggot choked to death on a fishbone in the surf 'n turf. (CHUCKLES) Nobody tried to save her 'cause everybody thought she was laughing. (MAKES GAGGING NOISES) (WILLARD LAUGHS) Do you live around here? Next door to the Reeds. Hey, that's where I'm staying. I know. I've been waiting for you. How old are you? Ten. How old are you? Nine. I thought you'd be bigger. Hey! Look who's talking, you midget. And it just so happens I'm exactly the right size for my age. So why don't you just get lost? You don't have to go crazy. It was just an observation. Where are you going? No place with you, so stop following me. I can go where I want. It's a free country. You want to go down to the river and catch crabs? I don't hang out with babies. My mother works in the coffee shop. I can get us free sodas. Do you want to see my sister Darlene with her clothes off? Why not? Nothing else to do around here. ROSEMARY: I don't know what he wants. He says we got married too young. He wants time on his own but I don't know for what. Men! Do you think that he might've met somebody else? Yeah, I think he has. He won't say, but I think he has. I haven't told Willard why his father's gone. He thinks he's away on sea duty. Okay. Thanks for taking him, Lily. I needed some time on my own to work things out, and his grandparents would've asked questions. Yeah. (SIGHS) You have such a wonderful life here. I envy you. (CHUCKLES) Have you known the Reeds a long time? BILLIE: Ever since I was a baby. Why? WILLARD: I met some man in the coffee shop who doesn't like them. He's crazy, they're nice. Even though my mom says Lily is long-suffering. WILLARD: What's that mean? I don't know. But it doesn't sound good to me, and people never say it about men. It really makes me sick that I have to grow up to be a woman. Did you build this? No. Ben did. I come here when I'm mad. Well, which is most of the time. I can't stand most people. They're always giving you a hard time about something. Yeah, I like animals better. Me, too. Ready? Yeah. Darlene. WILLARD: That's weird. What's weird? Ironing with your clothes off. Her boyfriend drives a truck. Last time he was here, he had the clap. WILLARD: "Clap," what's the clap? You don't know what the clap is? Yeah, I know. I just forgot for a minute. It's that disease truck drivers get, right? Right. But I bet you don't know how you get it. Yeah, I do. How? You tell me, if you're so smart. You get it from cheating. Cheating? Like on tests? Yeah. I heard Darlene tell... ROSEMARY: Willard! I have to leave. Mom. So... Here we are. Yeah. (ENGINE STARTS) (SCRUBBING DISHES) Why aren't you playing your game? I can beat it. Do you want something to eat? A cookie and a glass of milk, maybe? No, thanks. Do you want to help? Okay. See, you snip the ends off like this and put it in the colander. Your mother told me that you have a scholarship to Taunton. Yeah. It's a really good school. You must be very smart. Yeah. LILY: Do you like your teacher? Yeah. I know something you can do. This is great! Where did you get this? Ben made it. I, I don't think he'd want you to play with it. Here. But... Would you pick some blueberries for me? There's a trellis right by the garage. (CAR APPROACHING) (HUMMING) (GASPS) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Still here, huh? What are you doing here? Nothing exciting. I told my mother what you said, and she said I should stay away from you. Smart woman. But I think you're gonna have a problem with that. What do you mean? I live here. Ben Reed. Don't look so depressed. I'm hardly ever here. How long is he staying? Not long. A couple of weeks. Don't expect me to entertain him. I don't, Ben. I'll take care of him myself. Hey! I'm here. I exist. I'm not just some voice you hear in your head. You think you could look at me when we talk? Okay, Ben. I'm looking at you. (DOOR SLAMS) (URINATING) (DOORKNOB SQUEAKS) It's stuck. I know. That's why I opened it. You have everything you need? I don't know. I guess. You're gonna have to do better than that. Do you or don't you? Good night, Willard. Good night. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (BIRDS CAWING) I haven't seen your father around. What does he do? He's a professional roller-skater. Darlene's is a butcher from Detroit. Your mother's been married twice? (SCOFFS) She never got married once. I guess you spend a lot of time with your father, huh? Yeah. When he's home. He's a radioman on a destroyer. He's been on sea duty, so I haven't seen him for a couple of months. What makes you think he's coming back? What? Well, if he's been gone so long, what makes you think he's coming back? How do you know he hasn't just taken off? Because every time he goes away, he comes back, that's how. Then he'll probably come back this time. I just think people aren't coming back when they go away. Did your father go away? He was never around long enough to go away. (SCOFFS) Never laid eyes on the guy. Is that your boat? No. Hey, we could get in trouble. Scaredy cat. I have this daydream all the time about my father, where I go to this roller skating rink and he's there doing some sort of show. Anyway, I'm wearing this silver dress, and I skate over to him, but he doesn't know who I am. So, I do all these amazing tricks, and then he knows it's me and we skate away together. Get out of sight, quick. What is it? What's wrong? It's her boat! WILLARD: Who is she? She's a witch! BILLIE: I know it's a long climb, but when you get up to the top, it's like flying. Hey! We could fall off this thing! BILLIE: Don't be afraid. Just don't look down. I'm not afraid, and you didn't have to tell me that. I knew it. (PANTING) So what do you think? It's all right. Jump up here, and it's more than all right. What are you doing? Are you crazy? What are you doing? Get down from there! BILLIE: Why? I've done this lots of times. It's not hard. You just can't be scared. Now you do it! I don't want to do it. Why not? I just think it's dumb. I mean, what's such a big deal about walking a couple of planks? Any retard could do that. Do you have a lot of friends? Yeah. I'm the most popular kid on my block. I figured. I don't have a lot of friends. People think I'm a show-off. (GASPS) Look at the dolphin! See its tail? If you're bored, we could still go to a shopping mall. I'm not bored. (BIRDS CALLING) So, before I read the Psalm, I want you all to take a moment and concentrate on what His message is for us. For it is a message of love. Reach out to the person next to you and take his hand in love. And remember these words. "Forgive our trespasses "as we forgive those who trespass against us." And reach out in forgiveness. Reach out in the image of divine love. Give your hand in forgiveness and love. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) I don't know why I let you drag me to these services. I can't stand listening to that guy's bullshit. Watch your language, Ben. My language? How about the Reverend Close's language? Since when do words like love and forgiveness qualify as bad language? When they're spoken by a hypocrite, to a room full of hypocrites. (SIGHS) Just because people aren't perfect doesn't make them hypocrites. BEN: Artie Parker's been sleeping with Bert Udall's wife for two years. Ernie Wait's foreclosing that poor old man Belson, and forced him into a rest home. Teddy McKeon cheated his sister out of her share of the grocery. And the Reverend Close doesn't believe in God. He believes in the sound of his own voice. We used to laugh at these phonies. Now you want me to hold hands with them on Sunday. Where'd your spirit go, Lily? Why are you buying this sanctimonious crap? Because it comforts me. Well, there's more to life than being comforted. Like what? Living. Oh, God! I hate Sundays. So dead. Dead and quiet. What about you? You hate Sundays? I don't know. I guess. Why do you always say that? Say what? Every time I ask you a question, you say, "I don't know, I guess." What do you think's gonna happen if you have an opinion about something? Gonna get struck by lightning? How come you always do that? What? Make everything so hard. That's a good question. That's a very good question. MAN: (ON TV) We move to the bottom half of inning two. Ron Gant, Lonnie Smith and Brian Hunter. (CROWD CHEERING ON TV) (TV CONTINUES PLAYING) Lonnie Smith moves into the batter's... (SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING) (TURNS TV VOLUME UP) (VOLUME TURNED DOWN) (WHIRRING) (TURNS TV VOLUME UP) (VOLUME TURNED DOWN) (SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING) (VOLUME TURNING UP) (VOLUME LOWERS) What are you listening to? What are you listening to? Rap. (MUSIC STOPS) Rap? Yeah. My English teacher thinks it's a highly important form of modern poetry. It details the common man's struggle for survival in a hostile environment. Do you play baseball? No. But I am very interested in aviation. What? I saw that World War II fighter you made. What fighter? The spitfire. It's really cool. Did you make it when you were a kid? No, I didn't make it for me. Where'd you find it? In the cabinet in the workroom. Does it fly? Well, I don't know if it flies. (SIGHS) I haven't flown it for a long time. Maybe it's time I did. Where did you say you saw it? WILLARD: On the bottom shelf. BEN: Grab that remote out of that plastic. (PLANE ENGINE RUNNING) Here, it's yours. I can have a turn flying it? No, you can have it. I'm giving it to you. Go on. Take it! Just remember, if you break it, I'm not going to rebuild it. What do you mean? I mean in about one minute, it's gonna crash into the creek. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. REVEREND CLOSE: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of shadow of death, "I shall fear no evil, "for thou art with me. "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of thine enemies. "And thou anointest my head "with oil. "Yes, my cup runneth over. "Surely, I shall dwell in the house of the lord forever." (WOMAN SCREAMS) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) You know, Mr. Fiske was mean. He shot Hardy Kramer's dog. If he knew what we just did, he'd kill us. Well, he's dead, so we don't have to worry. How do you know? How do you know dead people can't see us? 'Cause I can't see them. You can't see germs either. You can see them with a microscope. Maybe nobody's ever invented a way to see ghosts yet. Even though you can't see him, maybe Mr. Fiske is climbing out of the coffin. He's floating up through the leaves, and now he's almost next to you. Worms are crawling all over him. His eyes are like mushroom soup. He's lifting his hands, he's reaching out for your neck... He's (LOUDLY) right behind you! (GASPS) (LAUGHING) Don't ever do that! I hate it! WOMAN: Billie! Is that you screaming? Oh, no, my mother! I'm not supposed to be up here. I'm coming! We're going to Brimley to meet her new boyfriend. Darlene says he has bad breath, but he runs a movie house, so we get in for free. You better be coming! Come on! Hurry up, we're late! If I didn't have the stretch marks to prove it, I'd swear to God you're not my daughter. You don't have a feminine bone in your body. Hey, you wipe the smile off your face, young lady. If you think I'm taking you to the picture show covered in leaves and dirt, you've got another... (SALLY SCREAMS) (BILLIE LAUGHS) You little beast! Come on! (MOANING) Poor Mr. Parkett will think he befriended the kind of people who live in bus terminals! Darlene! Hi. Hi. This came for you this morning from your mom. Every time I get a letter from my father, the envelope's gone. What? Well, how do I know where he is if the envelope's always gone? Your mother and father told you where he is. Yeah. But how do I know it's true? Do you want to call your mother and ask her? No. It's not important. Wouldn't you rather be off playing? No. I like to help you. (EXHALES AND CLEARS THROAT) LILY: What are you doing up so early, Willard? I thought maybe he could come with me today, instead of hanging out here. LILY: I wish you'd told me sooner. (KETTLE CLATTERING) BEN: Why? Were you planning on doing something? (SIGHS) No, just surprised. I thought you said you didn't want to... BEN: It doesn't matter what I said before. I'm saying this now. Are you ready? Yeah. Goodbye. Bye. (ENGINE STARTS, CAR HUMS) (FOG HORN IN DISTANCE) Good Morning, John. Morning, Captain. (GRUNTS) Careful! (VOICE ON RADIO) What kind of fish do you catch? What kind of boat is this? A shrimp... Boat. Right. John! Get the line. (MOTOR HUMMING) Thanks for taking me. It was fun. You did a good job. Listen, uh... (CLEARS THROAT) I know I'm rough sometimes, but, uh... I don't mean anything by it. I know that. Oh, you do, huh? Yeah. I know you like me. Ben? Yeah? Can I ask you something? Sure. Anything. What's the clap? (FISHERMEN SHOUTING) Finally back. I was beginning to wonder what happened to you. I come back the same time every day, Lily. What are you doing here? Nothing. Just some shopping. Did you have fun? Oh, yeah! It was great! Well, you must be hungry. Wanna go to the coffee shop? Sure. Okay. In that case, I'll see you later. Well, aren't you coming with us? I don't think so. I got other things to do. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) SALLY: That Joan Collins knows a thing or two about life, you know. I got this picture from her through the mail. And I knew that I wasn't alone. "Dear, Sally. Be strong, be pretty." "Dear, Joan. What else can I be?" (LAUGHS) Do you think she's pretty? LILY: Who? Her. Absolutely. Thank you. I think she's fat. No, she's not fat, she's voluptuous. What does that mean? That means that she's fat in all the right places. (CHUCKLES) You mean her fried eggs? Her what? Well, that's what they look like to me. (CHUCKLING) Yeah. I mean her fried eggs. Willard... Here sit on the bed. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved. And he that keepeth thee shall not sleep. Behold. He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord himself is thy keeper. You know, it's funny. I haven't been to this spot since Lily and I used to come here years ago. To fish? No, not to fish. It was before we were married. Seemed like no matter where we started out, (LAUGHS) we always ended up here. To do it? Come on, wise guy. Watch me cast this a couple of times, and then I'll let you try. (BIRDS SQUAWKING) (SIGHS) You know, Lily used to be... Different. Not the person you know now. She wasn't afraid of anything. First time I saw her, she walked right up to me on the street in Brimley, and she said, "You look like trouble. Wanna take me out?" (CHUCKLES) She was so full of life. She gave off a kind of heat. My God, I thought she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen in my life. Don't you think she's beautiful now? Yeah, she's beautiful. (SIGHS) But it doesn't matter anymore. Come on. Fishing and talking don't really go together. BEN: Okay, let's get you rigged up. Who was James? How do you know about James? I saw Lily put flowers on his grave. James was our son. He died two and a half years ago, when he was three. How did he die? An accident. Damn. I'm all thumbs today. Is that why you and Lily are always mad at each other? Maybe. But since it's not worth thinking about, what do you say we just drop it? Do me a favor. Don't bring this up to Lily, okay? Yeah. All right, come on. (GRUNTS) Every hour you spend fishing adds an hour to your life. All right. Come over here. Right around here. Now... When I say so, I want you to let loose with your finger. Now. (CHUCKLES) Good. All right, start to reel in. (TICKING OF FISHING REEL) (BIRDS SQUAWKING) God. How can I explain it? It's not his looks. You know, I could live with that. I don't even mind his breath that much. His breath? He has advanced gingivitis. I just... I can't put my finger on what bugs me about him. You know? It's, it's not on the surface. It's, it's like deep down inside of him. Sometimes, when I see him walk across the room, just the sight of him makes my flesh crawl. And haven't you been telling me for years that I've been throwing myself away on the wrong guys? Yeah. Well, isn't it obvious? I mean... If I've spent my whole life falling in love with dreams that made my life miserable, then it just goes to follow that a guy I can't stand will make me happy. Look at all the fish we caught! I caught two of them. You did? Well, I sort of caught two of them. Ben was holding the rod, too. That's how I catch fish, too. With Ben holding the rod. Hello, Sally. Hi. Don't you go to the movies on Sundays? What're you doing here? Yeah. Well, I've seen that feature nine times. Got to get going. I got to pick up Billie and Darlene at the theater. I am sick of romance, Lily. What I want now is security. If that means giving up the sexual fireworks, that's what I have to do. I mean God knows in that department, I have experienced enough to make 10 women happy for life. (SALLY LAUGHS) So... How was the good reverend's message this morning? Inspirational? Uplifting? Yes, it was. He talked about... (SIGHING) Getting a sunburn. (CHUCKLING) What? Something about the sun burning thee not by day. I slept through most of it. Here, I'll do that. You hate to clean fish. I thought the deal was you catch 'em and I clean 'em. BEN: Come on, we're changing the deal. Ben thinks you're beautiful. (MUFFLED VOICES, LAUGHTER) (LOW MOANING) (COW MOOS) (HEAVY BREATHING) DARLENE: Frank... I love you. (COW MOOS) (HEAVY BREATHING, LAUGHTER) I love you, Frank. I love you too, Darla. (LOW MOANING) (GIGGLING) (GASPS) Oh, God! You spying little bitch! (LAUGHTER) FRANK: Get out you two. Get out of here! If I get my hands on you, I'll wring your neck! (KIDS LAUGHING) (MOCK PANTING) Oh, God. Oh, God. So, will she tell on us? No. She doesn't want my mother to know. She'll know when she has a baby. She won't have a baby. She'll get cursed instead. What do you mean, cursed? Every month, women get this curse put on them. I don't know who does it, but once they get the curse, they don't have a baby. (MOCKING) Oh, Frank! I love you. (LAUGHING) BILLIE: I love you. (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGH) You're my best friend. Hey, wait! WILLARD: Wait up. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) (GIGGLING) (THUNDER) Don't go in the water. It's gonna rain. So what? So if lightning strikes we'll be fried like two bugs on a hot plate. (SCOFFS) That's what. Cool. When are you going home? I don't know. I'm gonna have a paper route this fall. If you stay, we can have one together. No. I have to go back for school. Yeah, I guess. Are all the kids in your school smart like you? No. Most of them are just rich. (CHUCKLES) Do you have a best friend? No. Look. All that stuff I said about being popular, I just made it up. I don't have a lot of friends either. I know I'm younger than you, but am I your best friend? Yeah. Yeah, you are. I thought so. WILLARD: Who cares if it rains? BILLIE: We'll get struck by lightning. (GIGGLES) (LAUGHTER) Who did this? I did. (CHUCKLES) It's Ben's grandmother. She used to pinch me on my arm to get my attention. (WILLARD CHUCKLES) WILLARD: Who's the guy with the beard and long hair? That's Ben! Our Ben? Yeah, our Ben. That was when he was going through his rebellious phase. He was gonna give up fishing and move to the big city. How did you meet him? I was visiting my cousin in Brimley and... It was love at first sight. Right on the sidewalk in front of Woolworth's. (LAUGHING) Everybody said I was absolutely crazy. Ben had a real reputation for being wild, and being a lady's man. Two qualities that I just love in a man. Don't you love Ben anymore? What a question to ask, Willard. See, I think Mary Queen of Scots was a moron to think Queen Elizabeth was going be nice to her if she moved to England, the place was full of people who wanted to kill Elizabeth so Mary could be queen. Where did you learn all that stuff? History's my favorite subject. I got the school history medal last year. WILLARD: Do you want to hear more? BEN: Sure, it's interesting. WILLARD: Well, Queen Elizabeth stuck Mary in the tower. And after a long time, she had her head cut off. And this is really gross. They picked her head up by the hair, and the hair came off because she was wearing a wig. And the head was still talking! The worst part is, her dog was hiding under her dress. And when she died, he started howling. A few days later, he died of a broken heart. Billie! Oh, Billie, you're all wet! WILLARD: Ben, come on! Oh, go away! Come on, please. All right. Come on. BEN: Come here. Put your foot right in here. Come here. Your foot! (GIGGLING) (LAUGHS) The water's great, isn't it? Mmm-hmm. It was fun today, wasn't it, Ben? BEN: Yeah. Willard asleep? Mmm-hmm. LILY: Oh, I love nights like this. The air is so soft, you can feel it on your skin. Well, it's been a long day. I think I'll go to bed, too. LILY: No, I can't. I can't. (TEARFULLY) I said I can't, Ben! I was willing to leave you alone. Why in the hell didn't you just stay away from me? (SOBBING) Hey, Ben, how are you doing? Just great, Pete. Let me have a whiskey, please. To the ice queen. (CRUMPLING METAL) Shit! LILY: Ben. Are you all right? How I am doesn't really matter, Lily. The real question is, how are you? I can't make up my mind. Are you sick of me or are you just dead inside? Don't walk away, Lily! BEN: It's bad manners to walk away when someone asks you a question. LILY: Why don't we talk about this in the morning? BEN: I don't want to leave it till morning. I want to settle it right now. I've left this for over two years. And I am not going to leave it a single minute longer. You're hurting my arm. BEN: I don't give a damn. I don't give a damn. I have had it. LILY: Aw! (EXCLAIMS) (SCREAMS) LILY: Help! Stop it, Ben. Stop it! (SOBBING) Stop it. Ben! LILY: Stop it. You're not the only one who lost a child, Lily! So did I! So did I! And that pain is going to stay with me the rest of my life! Jimmy's dead, Lily. Jimmy's dead, god damn it! And you can't bring him back by turning this house into a graveyard! (SOBBING) He's dead, damn it! But I'm alive! I'm alive. And I'm not going to pretend to be dead anymore, just to keep you company! Get your hands off me, Ben. Why should I? Help! (SOBBING) Why should I? I'm your husband, aren't I? I'm your husband. I'm just playing by your rules, Lily. I'm just playing by your rules. (SOBBING) Stop it! My heart's not in this any more than yours is! (BEN BREATHING HARD) (LILY CRYING) My God! My God... I don't know what's happening to me. How did I get... To be this person? LILY: I heard him cry. What? (TEARY) I heard him cry and I didn't go. I never could tell you that. I could never tell anybody. I was, I was sewing and... I heard him cry, just once. And I waited and he didn't make another sound. And so I kept on sewing and... (SOBBING) When I went in to get him from his nap, he was dead. If I'd gone, he wouldn't have choked on that candy. If I'd gone, he... He wouldn't be dead. I can't... (SNIFFLES) Stand to be touched. I can't stand to feel anything. All I can stand is to just be numb inside. And to be sorry every single minute. Because when I'm not, I hear his crying in my head, over and over and over. (LILY CRYING) It's not your fault, Lily. Nobody can answer every little cry. LILY: It doesn't matter. Not a minute goes by that I don't hear his cry in my head. I can't help you, can I, Lily? No. I can't go on living like this. I'm leaving. (SOFTLY) I guess it's time. Yeah... I guess it is. What are you staring at? Nothing. Then let's go. You sure you want to do this? So what do you think? Do I look like him? Yeah. You do. Come on! Let's go! All right. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) (GIRL SHOUTING) (BLUESY MUSIC PLAYING) MAN: (OVER PA) Clear the floor, please. Clear the floor. The afternoon session is over. Clear the floor, please! (PEOPLE CHEERING INDISTINCTLY) Everyone off the floor. Advanced classes only! This would be him! Off the floor, please. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (COUGHS) MAN: You booked in for a class? No. Well, if you're not booked in for a class, you gotta get out of the practice ring. It's off limits. But I'm Billie Pike. Are you deaf? I said, you're not allowed in here. Hey, Eddie. Come on, man. You're not doing your job. You're supposed to keep these kids off the practice ring. But there's something I have to tell you! Well, tell it to Eddie. EDDIE: Come on, kid, it's advanced classes only. But you're my father! Don't forget my Jim Beam, Eddie. SALLY: Oh, my God! Look at that lifeline. (CHUCKLING) It's as long as the Ohio Turnpike! Oh, do I see love? You know, I have never seen so much love in one hand. You are a sneaky guy, Lou. (LAUGHS) I had no idea you were such a passionate man. Well, look at you! Boy, I must have asked you to wear that dress over 100 times, but no, you wouldn't. (CHUCKLES) You went to Brimley, didn't you? (SIGHS) Honey, come here. Come on. Come here. (SOBBING) Don't. It's okay. Oh, don't cry. It'll be okay. Oh, you look so pretty. SALLY: It's okay. It's okay. Hi. Oh, hey, hey. Look who's here! What you doing? (EXHALES) Huh? What you doing? Oh, uh, unpacking. How come? How come what? How come you're still unpacking? Most people unpack when they first get to a place. How come you're still doing it? I don't know. You didn't fix the garage. What? You said you'd fix the garage, but you didn't do it. Willard, did you come here to drive me insane? No. I missed you. That's all. I'm sick of doing this. Play poker? Yeah. My father taught me. So, is he a good player? Oh, yeah. He's really smart About things like that. (COINS CLATTERING) I wonder when he's coming home. Been gone a long time. Do you think he might not be coming back? Well, I can't answer that question, Willard. Maybe you should ask someone who can. WILLARD: No. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. Don't run away from things just because they scare you, Willard. If you do, you'll always be afraid. It's a bad way to live. What did your father teach you to play? Everything. But I prefer draw poker. I think it's the purest version of the game. Ante up. I bet a dime. I'll see you and raise you a dime. Okay. I'll see you and raise you another dime. Call. How many cards do you want? One. One? Yeah, one. Are you sure you don't want two or three? I'm sure. I miss you, too, Willard. I miss you, too. (PIANO MUSIC) WILLARD: What are you doing? (GASPS SOFTLY) You scared me. What's that? (CLEARS THROAT) A letter from your mom? Yeah. The mailman just came. What did she have to say? I don't know. She painted my room. I heard you crying last night. Sorry. I guess you miss Ben, huh? Yeah, I guess I miss Ben. (SIGHS) How would you like to go to the movies this afternoon, and maybe get some Chinese food? Okay. If you miss him, why don't you ask him to come back? Willard, please... People are supposed to stay together. You could ask him to come back. He'd do it if you did. (SIGHS AND SNIFFLES) Sometimes things happen to people. Hard things. And... They get broken inside. I want Ben to come back, but I don't know if I can fix what's broken inside of me. I'm afraid to ask him to come back. (SIGHS) I'm gonna get the paper and see what's playing. Okay? Okay. Okay. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) What do you want? Can I have a glass of water? "May I." Not "Can I have a glass of water, please?" Yes, if next time you ask before you steal my boat. Please don't touch anything. This plant is poisonous. Is this poisonous? I doubt it. These extravagant gestures of yours are not impressive. They're just silly. It's nice here. I know. Can I stay for a while? Not now, I'm working. Well, thanks, and so long. You're welcome, and so long. Can I come back and visit sometime? "May I come back and visit sometime, please?" And, yes, you may. What's your name? Billie Pike. I'm Catherine Reston Lee. Till we meet again, Billie Pike. (SCOFFS) Yeah, Catherine Reston Lee. Billie? The next time I see you, I want your clothes to be clean and your hair combed. Why? Because people like us must maintain our standards. No matter what happens to us, we must always maintain. (ALL SINGING) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you (LAUGHS) ♪ Happy birthday dear Sally ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Oh, I could cry. I mean, I really could. Yay! I just feel so loved. (CHUCKLES) I can't believe you all went to so much trouble for my birthday. What are you talking about? This whole thing was your idea. Oh, my goodness! Look at all those candles. (CHUCKLES) Whoever dreamed that one day I would be 29? (BOTH LAUGH) Twenty-nine? You're kidding. I thought you were... Okay, everybody. It's time to blow out the candles and make a wish. I think we know what that's gonna be, don't we, darling? SALLY: Yes, Ernest. I think we do. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) I did it! (LAUGHS) Do you want to tell them, or should I? I guess I have to start acting like the head of the household sometime, don't I? What? I am happy to announce that Sally and I have decided to get married in September. I hate you! You don't even love him! Billie! Don't pay any attention to her. She's just a kid. She's not a kid, she's a wild animal. ERNEST: I won't have any wild animals living under my roof, I can tell you that. She'll learn some manners when I start running things even if I have to teach her the hard way. Who wants cake? What is that stuff on you? Lightning bug tails. That's disgusting. I don't care. He's not so bad. She doesn't even like him. That face she makes when he tries to kiss her. She's always being so nice to him. I know her. She's always the nicest to people she can't stand. You'll get to go to the movies for free. And maybe you'll like it. Like what? Having a father around. I like it. What are you talking about? You don't have a father around either. I do, too. For somebody so smart, you sure are dumb. Why do you think he's been gone so long? It's none of your business. Will you just shut up? Why should I shut up? What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything. You're afraid of anything that moves. And if you don't want me to tell you about your father, then ask Lily. I'm not gonna listen to you anymore. Don't. Go listen to liars. I don't know any liars except you! I am not a liar! Everybody else is, including your mother! I told you to shut up! BILLIE: I heard my mother tell Darlene your father isn't on sea duty. He left your mother for some other woman. That's a dirty rotten lie! I never, ever want to see you again, so get away from me! (CRYING) Willard! Willard! Where are you? Billie, are you up there? Yeah. Have you seen Willard? Yeah. Well, where is he? BILLIE: He's gone. Gone where? I said his father's gone, and he ran away. LILY: Willard! BILLIE: Willard! (GLASS BREAKING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Ben. Lily. Willard's missing. Are you sure? No, I'm sure of it. I didn't pick up any kid of that description since my shift started and that was at 5:00. But don't worry, ma'am. If I do, I'll call you. Thank you. BEN: Yeah, that's right. It would've been after 8:00 tonight. Okay. Thanks. Well, if anything changes, you'll be sure to call, right? Okay, great. Yeah, goodnight. (SIGHS) At least he's not in the hospital. How are you doing, Lily? Are you okay? Fine. Did you find Willard? BEN: No. SALLY: Billie's gone too. I'm gonna keep looking. Where's Ernest? Oh, he's at home. He likes to be asleep by 10:00. (SIGHS) I can't believe I'm marrying somebody who'd go to sleep at a time like this. I can't believe you are, either. Yeah. Well, maybe I won't. (CHUCKLES) You know what the worst thing is about Billie? She's always right. She has the best instincts of anybody I ever met. God only knows where she got 'em. Willard! (BIRDS SCATTER) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (OWL HOOTING) Billie! Willard! (AIRPLANE ENGINE WHIRRING) I found him! I found him! Oh. (SALLY CRIES) Hi, Willard. Are you okay? Stay away from me! BEN: Okay. But, uh... What are you doing up there? Never mind! Do you need help getting down? No! And I told you to stay away from me! I did it! (WILLARD GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WILLARD WHIMPERS) Hi, Mom. It's me, Willard, your son. I know you know I'm your son. Mom? I'm calling because I want you to tell me the truth about Daddy. LILY: Come in. You comfortable? Do you think my father's coming back? I hope so. I think he is. Hey, Willard. What? Why did you walk that railing this morning? I don't know. I'm just sick of being afraid. What do you mean? I'm always afraid of things. I don't know why, but I am. And I just thought if I did something that really scared me, maybe I wouldn't be afraid anymore. Did it work? Yeah. It did. You know what I mean? About being afraid all the time? Yeah. I know what you mean. I know exactly what you mean. What are you doing here? I thought you didn't like me anymore. I changed my mind. What are you doing? A watercolor of digitalis. Catherine Reston Lee gave me the paints. She thinks I have talent. How come you changed your mind? I'm going home this afternoon. I can't take this on the bus. So... Will you keep it for me till I come back? Who are you kidding? You're not coming back. I wouldn't leave the plane if I wasn't coming back, would I? No, I guess not. Well... I guess I'd better go back. I have to pack my stuff. Okay. Bye. Bye. Are we still best friends? Yeah. Willard? Yeah? (BABY CRYING) You hold him. Support his head. (BABY CONTINUES CRYING) Will you remember to write? I promise. Okay. (SIGHS) So long, Ben. So long, Willard. Come on, you better get going. You don't want the bus to leave without you, do you?
