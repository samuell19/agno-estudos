Ha Lan hasn't been to school for a few days, Ngan. Are you going home? There's the year end campfire tonight. How about... We go together? Maybe Ha Lan will be there tonight. Anyway, I will head out first. When I was younger, much younger, I didn't have any girlfriends. I spent most of my days playing with my mom and grandma. I was a troublemaker, and would get disciplined often by my father. But during those times, I got to meet Dreamy Eyes... My first girlfriend ever. Back then, I didn't call her Dreamy Eyes. I called her Ha Lan, just like everyone else. There was a market named "Do Do" in my village. Long ago, the market's name became the name of my village. Growing up, everywhere I went, I would tell people I'm from Do Do. When I think of Do Do, I only think of my childhood... and Ha Lan. Can I sit over there? Hey, Hong! Teacher's here! Help the neighbor in need. Help the neighbor in need... Take care of the crippled. Take care of the crippled... When faced with the old and weak. When faced with the old and weak... Offer medicine, offer porridge. Offer medicine, offer porridge... Heavens favor the Kind. What is that smell? Order! Dear teacher! Ngoc just pooped in his pants! Go to bed! What are you smiling about? Can you switch seats with Ngoc? What happened? Hoa… What did he do? He took my rubberband rope. I tried to get it back... and he stomped on my foot. Hey, you! Hey, you! Beat him! Beat him up! Teacher Phu is coming! Teacher Phu is coming! Run… run… run! Ngan! Are you ok? Get up! What did you stuff in my nose? Mugwort. To stop the bleeding. Are you sure? What if you're wrong and I just drop dead? I didn't know you're a scaredy cat. Who says I'm a scaredy cat? No scaredy cat would take your rubberband back! Will you get in trouble with your dad? Nah! My daddy loves me! Why can't you just stay out of trouble? Sit down! Let me teach him a lesson! My mom loved me, but she was scared of my dad, so she couldn't protect me. In my house, there was also Nhuong and Quyen, my cousins. Hey, you two! The only person that could protect me was grandma. Stop! She gave birth to dad, so he had to listen to her. She was my savior. I wasn't trying to make trouble. They were bullying Ha Lan, I was trying to protect her! Do you mean Ha Lan, Mr. Dieu's niece... who lives near the market? Yes, grandma, that's her. She's a good girl. Her eyes are beautiful, like dreamy eyes. Dreamy eyes... Tuna Vermicelli. Hey, Ngan! What's Dreamy Eyes? Only now do I understand, Ha Lan had awakened in me a man's need to protect his woman. Ha Lan! Why didn't you call me? I didn't know I had to. Of course you do, dummy! Next time, call me ok? I'll protect you from Hoa and his goons! Oh yeah! OK, let's go! Hey Ngan, this one's cute. This one is cute too. Later when I'm rich, I will buy them all for you! Really? Really! Grandma! When I grow up, I want to marry Ha Lan. I hope so too. Dreamy Eyes. When we reached middle school, we moved to the district to study. Every weekend, we would go back to visit home. Let's go to the Forest! The way home is always the most beautiful. But now, there's something even more beautiful than that. Dreamy eyes... in her Ao Dai dress. As if over night, my childhood friend had blossomed into a beautiful young lady. I could hardly recognize her. Ngan! There's a lot of ripe fruits here! Let me get that for you. Huh? What are you laughting at? I'm laughing at you! Why? You called me by my name. Well, we are all grown up. Yes. You sure grew up fast. Last year it was you, it's my turn this year. Boys grow up slower than girls, right? Ngan! You came to hang out? Who has time to hangout? I'm here to study. Wow, you came to study with me? Yeah, my mom made me. Oh… who cares! As long as you're here. Ngan! Why don't you play something for me. Right now? Yes! What song? Any song. I just started practicing this song. I'm not that good yet. Just play! Wow! Who's song is this? It's by Cung Tien. These songs… You wrote them didn't you? Don't lie! I wrote all the songs in that year book. I knew all along. I'll be leaving for the city in 2 days. Why? We won't start 10th grade for another 2 months. My family wants me to attend summer school. Ok… You go first, and I'll come later. In the city, it will be so sad without you. I don't know if I could make new friends there. Hang in there! Wait for me. A gift for you, don't make fun of it! That whole month, when Ha Lan went to the city for summer school, she only came back home one time. When she came home, there was something different about her. Even her simple way of dressing was slowly disappearing. The market in the city is huge, just walking through it will make you tired. Hey you, buy yourself a figurine. Let's check it out! This chicken looks nice, Ha Lan. Nah, boring. No, thank you. Ha Lan! What about this one? They have tons in the city! Even ones that look like butterflies, really pretty! Which ever one you want, I will buy for you. What I really like, you won't find here. It's so small! They're so much bigger in the city. Well, our village was hit by floods this year, so this is all that we've got. Let's go home, Ngan. When you come to the City, you'll see how much better it is! Finally, the day came when I went to the city for high school. Ha Lan stayed with her aunt. While I stayed with uncle Huan. Ngan! - Yes. - Come in! Come in. What's that stunned look for? Sit down! This is Dung, my only son. He's really good in school. Every grade… he had to do twice. He'll be in your class this year. So you know how to play too? Don’t mind him. I heard you are excellent in school. Please help my son. I would like to see him graduate at some point. Yes sir! Go up stairs and clean up for lunch. Hey, when we're free, I'll teach you the electric. Who plays acoustic in this day and age? Ha Lan! Ha Lan! These are from America, you can't find these in the countryside. Here, help yourself! Thank you! - Make yourself comfortable, - Yes! Ha Lan should be down any minute. I'm hitting the Disco tonight! Ngan! What do you think about my new hair? Do you like this hair clip? How are you? Are you ok over there? Yes, it's okay. Oh! Remember the Apricot tree by the market? It fell last month, broke in half! Well, yes. It was dead long before that. Oh, Ha Lan! Yes? I'm going home now. But you just got here! I'll pick you up after school tomorrow, we'll go home together. Okay! What's… "okay"? Okay means "yes". Ngan! Ha Lan, you're here to hang out? To borrow a book, acutally. Can I borrow your copy of L'art de conjuger? I'll get it for you, wait here. Ngan! Why don't you invite our guest inside? Ha Lan! Come inside. It's okay. I'm fine out here. Why are you still standing there? Go get the book for Ha Lan. Please, come in. Okay! Wow, you're good! So, you often go to the disco? I need to get going. Ha Lan! Your book. Ha Lan loves it when I sing. You're trying to impress her with this? She only likes western music, especially American. Okay? Ha Lan! Oh, Dung. What are you doing here? Just finished school for the day. Thought I'd pass by and check out your school. Why don't we all go together? Have you got the chance to visit the famous sights here? No. Okay, let me take you! Maybe another day. - Maybe on our day off, I can take you. - Ha Lan, look! I'm going sightseeing, why don't you go home first. Hey, kid! Why do you look so constipated? Ah, must be heart broken. I'll see you later, Ngan. Hey! Where you going? Where are my pills? Second drawer on the left! Oh, I really wanted to see this movie, thanks for taking me. - Why don't we buy some snacks? - No time, we're late! Hey Ngan, all of a sudden... I feel a bit chilly. What's wrong? Huh? Mosquitoes. There's this place on Phan Dinh Phung that's really fun. Let me take you there. - Yes. - Okay! Hey, slow down, what's the hurry? Ngan! I'm so thirsty, why don't we grab a drink. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. Ngan! Let me take you home! But… I don't wanna go home. Where are you taking me Ngan? Hey, we're going dancing? When did you start liking discos? Come on! You wanna go hardcore? Hey look, it's Ha Lan. Where are you going? Back from the Disco? What an amazing night! Ha Lan! Thank you! Ha Lan… Let me come inside for a minute. Just for a minute. Some other time. I have to go somewhere soon. Dung. Is despicable. Lately. He hasn't come to see me. He's been hanging out with Bich Hoang. My affairs have nothing to do with you, Okay? You're hurting Ha Lan. I won't let you get away with this. You wanna be a hero or what? What did I do to her? Tell me! You're dating Ha Lan, but you're also going out with Bich Hoang. Men like you... are trash! Assholes! Who I love is my business! If you pity Ha Lan. Then go and love her! You can have my sloppy seconds! You had enough? You peasant. How did you fall off the bike? I didn't take you for a scaredy cat. Who says I'm a scaredy cat? If I was, how would I be able to take back your rubber rope? The worst thing about loving someone is not knowing if they know. I don’t know how to escape this sadness. I've had so many chances to tell her how I feel. But I can't be straight forward and I can't beat around the bush either. I hate myself for that. I've decided. I will tell Ha Lan. I love you... I love you more than anything. I only need to say it once. Once... is forever! Ha Lan hasn't been to school for several days now. Are you going home? There's the year end bonfire tonight. How about... We go together? Maybe Ha Lan will be there tonight. Ok, I'll head home first then. Hey! Why didn't Ha Lan show up tonight? Ha Lan! Ha Lan! Ha Lan! Ha Lan went to Quang Binh to visit her relatives. Do you have a message for her? Quang Binh? Can I have her address? Address? Well… Let me get back to you later? I have to go somewhere now. See you later! Where is Ha Lan? Why are you asking me? Who else am I going to ask? I haven't seen her. Don’t lie to me! Where is she? You go and find her! Am I right? I don’t know! Stop asking me. Damn you! Everyone is talking about it! You want to drag our family name through the dirt? I will never accept a girl like that as your bride! But dad… I… No but... We don’t do this kind of thing in our household. Understood? Dung! Dung! What are you doing here? I came to see you. Go home. I don't want to see anyone. Ha Lan. I know everything. You don't have to hide from me. What did Dung tell you? He told me. After graduation... he'll marry me. Hey it's Ngan, let's leave. Ngan! Ngan! Have you heard? Hong told me just now. Ha Lan got pregnant with Dung. Don't listen to those rumors. Ain't no rumors, man. Why do you think Ha Lan suddenly stopped going to class? Wait for me! Thank you! Lately. Does Dung still come to visit? He has someone else now. Who? Bich Hoang. I will not let him get away with this! Ngan! I don't want you to touch Dung. Here's your baby. Why aren't you feeding him? I'm all dried up. Ms. Huong! Are you awake? Mister! Mister! Ms. Trang! Ms. Trang! Ms.Trang! Ha Lan! Ngan! Time sure flies. I can’t believe you graduated. Where you planning to work? I'll go back to Do Do to teach. Why Do Do? You have so many choices. Do Do... is everything to me. You eat first. I'm not hungry yet. Wait. Where's Tra Long? I don't see her around. I sent her to live with her grandma. Ms. Dieu. What's wrong? Look at these sleeves! I can't even fit through it. Let me fix that for you. Hurry up! Yes. Auntie. Auntie! Tra Long! Why are you here by yourself? Look what I got you. Let's me carry you. Come here. I have a special love for Tra Long. When she was born, she was already without a father. And she was far from her mother just after turning one. Tra long is a spitting image of Ha Lan. Beautiful like her mother. Simply adorable. Those pretty eyes transcend three generations. She filled the void in my soul. Why did you go home so early yesterday? I was waiting for you to go home together. I had to leave early to pick up Tra Long's supplies. - Is this Ha Lan's daughter? - Yes. Wow, what a pretty girl. Just like her mother. If you're always around her, how will you forget her mother? Let me take you to your seat. Be a good girl. Come over here. Why don't we grab lunch later? Maybe some other time. I have to take Tra Long home before her Grandma gets too worried. Come with me. You sit here ok? Uncle Ngan! Uncle! You have to wait for me to go home. I'll be right over there. - Be a good girl in class? - Yes. In the city, Ha Lan's aunt gave her a loan to start her own tailor shop. Juggling between rent and staff money, Ha Lan had no time to take care of Tra Long. Nothing changed in Do Do Village. I caught an image of my youth. Come uncle come! Those youthful days, only I have yearned for. Which one do you like? This one! Hold on tight. I don't want you falling off. Don't worry, uncle. It won't fall! I'm being very careful. I'm not talking about the berries. Quick, Uncle! Mom is waiting! Miss... Can you tighten this up? Loosen these up. Mom's busy. Just wait a bit longer. Who's my little Princess? When will you come back to the village to visit me? When I find the time, I will come visit you, okay? Yes mom! I brought this for you. I picked it myself. Wow. I didn't know my daughter was so thoughtful! It's really yummy! I saved it for you. Tra Long. Hey, what do you want for supper? I don't wanna go home! I want... I want to go to the Rose Myrtle Forest! Ngan! There's ripe Myrtle here. You play very well. In the city... It will be sad without you. I don’t know if I will make any new friends. Uncle Ngan! Uncle Ngan! Let's go! Why don't I take you egg picking? Or would you like to pick berries? Your mom and I have explored this whole place. - Your mom used to... - Why do you keep talking about my mom? Do you think I'm pretty? You look beautiful, like your mom. I want to meet my daddy. Tell me who my daddy is... Did you try asking your grandma? I asked her, she said he died. That's a lie! How come he doesn't have an altar? No, Tra Long! It's sunny out, why don't we stay inside and play? But I wanna go out! C'mon mom, don't be lazy! What are you two playing? Uncle Ngan! Here's your food. Great! Saves me from going outside. There's only you two at home? Yeah, and Tra Long is giving me a headache. All day she's been wanting to go. I want to go to the Rose Myrtle Forest! There's nothing fun there. There are berries and eggs! Uncle Ngan said you used to love going there. I suppose we can go to the Rose Myrtle Forest. Really? But let Uncle Ngan take you. No! I want to go with both of you! I'm in the middle, you're on one side, Uncle Ngan on the other side. Go with Uncle Ngan, I've been working all day, look at my feet, they're all swollen, see? Come Tra Long, I'll take you. Let's go! I think you should separate them. It's about time Ngan starts a family of his own. I kept telling him that. But he wouldn't listen. He loves Tra Long. He loves Tra Long only because he loves you. Look at how long he's waited. He's done so much for you. Ngan is my best friend. Of course he's there to help. Don't be stupid. No man would do what he did and have no intentions with you. Ngan knows too much about me. It's best that we stay only friends. Here mom, take this. Don't worry, I could manage. This is for Tra Long. Go find a decent man. Don't hang around with those jerks. It's you who told me, no woman with a child out of wedlock could ever find a decent man. I was speaking about myself. Tra Long! Let's go! Then what did you say? I said, with all due respect. I have an incredibly beautiful woman... waiting for me. And of course I can't keep such a woman waiting for too long. So, we should resume this meeting tomorrow. Then what did he say? He said. In this life, there's nothing more important... than love. Who are they? Your relatives? This is Linh. And this is Ngan and Tra Long... from the countryside. We need to go to the store. We'll be back later. Mommy, come with me. Let me explain. It's okay. You and your daughter can catch up. I have somewhere to go. Linh! Ha Lan. I'm a horrible person, aren't I? Not at all. I keep thinking, if it weren't for Tra Long, I could've started over again. Come back to Do Do village. I'll take care of you. If only... we never left Do Do village. But we did leave. Everything is different, nothing will ever be the same. Things may change, but not my feelings for you. I will always be by your side. Anytime you need me. I can't. Me, Ha Lan, Tra Long. We could be a family. You may be able to forgive me. But I'll never be able to forgive myself. Everytime I look at Tra Long, I can only think of my mistake. And everytime I look at you. I can only think of what I've lost. She's a good girl. Her eyes are beautiful, like dreamy eyes. Grandma, when I get older, I want to marry Ha Lan. I hope so too. But I fear, that girl... won't live a happy life. Tra Long! Where is your cough medicine? It's alright, grandma. I won't need it. Where did you leave my balm? Check the shelves. Yes. Are you done packing? Why are you sitting there? I'm almost there. You got your coat and flu medicine? You make it sound like everyone who goes to the city catches colds and die. You won't die, but... What about your toothbrush? Toothpaste? Gosh, you're worse than grandma. It's your first time away from home, and living alone at that. I'm a little worried too. A dorm is not like at home, it won't be comfortable, so tough it out. And just because the professors aren't as strict, doesn't mean you can slack off. I know you're a smart girl, but... Education is a journey. That must be taken everyday. You keep worrying, I'm all grown up now. Quick! Before you miss the bus. Uncle Ngan! You must be here when I get back! Yes, missy! Uncle Ngan, how are you? Do you miss me? I miss you like I miss Do Do village. I'm doing fine at school, you won't have to worry about me. Finals are coming up, are you up late preparing classes again? You must stay healthy. You never practice what you preach. I have to pick my major this year. What should I choose? I did real well on the exams. You promised to reward me, remember? Mom's been sending me telegrams, but I never got the time to come visit her. I'm still a little mad at her, but I love her a lot too, I wonder if she's doing okay in the city. I wish that one day... mom, you... and I... could all live together. I hope you're watching your health, and don’t skip meals. Only one more week till I'm back. I wonder if the Royal Poinciana trees have bloomed yet. Hello auntie! Why are you eating so late? I got carried away grading papers so... Ha Lan sent some new shirts for you. She rarely gives out presents, and here she is, tailoring these shirts for you. She came back to give me this and took off. I don't know why she can't just give them to you herself. Are you upset at her? I wish I could bring myself to do that... Staying up late and catching the flu again. Have some porridge. Let me. This is... Oh. I got these shirts. I... I won these from the market. Don't be shy, take it. Your other shirts are... so old. Thank you. But… I already have shirts. I got new shirts... It's just that these are still good. You should find yourself someone to be with. Someone to cook, clean the house. Especially in times like these. I'm too old. Who would take me? God, you're only 35. What about me? What? Oh, I mean. I'm also 35. Maybe... Starting tomorrow... I could come over and take care of you? I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you. Is it Ha Lan? What then? What then Ngan? But... Can you even take care of her? And will she let you take care of her? Do you know how many men I have turned down? I'm sorry. Soon. I'll move to Saigon. I'm not going to be stuck in Do Do village anymore. You being stuck here is enough. Uncle Ngan! I'm back! I'm back for good this time! Gosh, you wouldn’t even know. I yelled and yelled at her. She didn’t dare to invite her boyfriend back after that. What about when you want to invite your boyfriend? Oh, I don't like young boys. I like mature men. You talk like an old lady. Uncle! Here goes that pouting again! I'm not pouting, I'm all grown up. Do Do village welcomed home another daugther. The village seemed to come alive. Above the tree in the market. the sky shined blue and clear like crystals. It was strangely beautiful like Spring has come in the middle of Summer. Here, try this. My little girl is such a great cook. Who are you calling little girl? I can't believe my little girl cooks so well! If you come home more often, I'll cook for you. Mom. Why is uncle Ngan still alone? Because... he hasn't found anyone worthy. You always talk about worthiness. What I mean is, he's a good man. He deserves a good woman. What about you mom? Are you not worthy of him? Finish your meal. Don't talk nonsense. I always have this feeling that uncle Ngan only has eyes for you. He's only happy when he visits you. Not compatible. We're very different. Should only be friends. Friends... would be more long lasting. You're right, mom. You and uncle aren't compatible at all! You little rascal! Isn't that what you just said? Why are you stopping? It's late. Go home, or your grandma will be worried. It's not late. It's not even dark out. She knows I'm here. Let me stay here tonight with you. No. You're going home, young lady! Let's go... C'mon! Get up! I... Let's go to the hills. I'm not afraid of the sun. Careful, you don't want to catch a cold. Yes! Uncle Ngan! Why don't you sing something for me? What song? The song that goes... "and from then my soul is a song of purity." I... I don't remember that song. Then, let me remind you. Let's go home. My dearest Tra Long. Tomorrow, I will be leaving. I know everyone will be sad and you will be the saddest. Your love for me is so pure, warm... so true. You are the only one who stayed behind. Like me, you love the village. You love the village, because it's your childhood, your memories, your family... and because I was there. Mom. He's gone. Because of me, he left. Don't be sad! Uncle Ngan loves you so much. He only loves you. Do you remember? Last Tet, you couldn't come home. Grandma wasn't angry... but she was very sad. She said... in this life, there are two things you should never miss. One, the last bus home. Two, the person that truly loves you. Am I right, mom? In this life, only you can bring him happiness. You know. You're the only one that can make him stay. He's the one that truly loves you. I know you love him too. You two deserve to be with each other. Please don't let him go like this! Tra Long. I know that you won't cry. Am I right? I love you. Love you so much. Since the day I saw you crawling under the Jasmine vines. But in a person's life with their tiny heart, there is only enough room for one true love. That love, I've given it all to your mother. No one forced me to reminisce. No one forced me... to remember this small village, everytime the sun goes down. No one forced me... to love only one person. I understand that. And accept it like a scar of fate. In this life, there are two things you should never miss. The last bus home. And the person that truly loves you.
