Me Tarzan, you Jane. Do you think I don't know? Take care since I did the same one day and got stressed. Do you think I don't know? You have to realize that our lazy life can end at any moment. Do you have any idea? No. I always have to think about everything. But I have a plan. Since the oil price has risen, our stock has increased. It's the Orient. We need to hire an odalisque. That one is violent! Violent! Shut up, asshole! I came because I was called. If it's to listen to a tantrum, mommy here is going away. Someone told me that you could help us. That's totally false. I'm not a helper. Let's get straight to the point. We are looking for an odalisque. Can you get one? My dear, you're asking the wrong person. I wanna be far way from odalisques. If one appears in my carnival block, I will beat them up Awesome! That one's violent, aren't they! Shut up, asshole! And you, annoying guy, If you happen to see me, be careful! If I happen to see you? God forbid! Excuse me. I wanna get some money. Do you wanna help me? Let's rob the cashier, then we'll catch a plane and go away Are you in? Please, In terms of folklore, I've stopped in Ipanema's band. Please, could you disintegrate? Go fuck yourself in Tiradentes Square! Go, idiot, go! Asshole! Everybody to the bathroom! Someone told me these people are different but go be this different in Bariloche. Be careful, man, we bite! I bite as well and I'm not vaccinated. Here is still here. My name is Divine Lady. One day you will know my story! But I loved Greta Garbo! I'll take you to my harem. Only if it's in Baghdad and there is pot. It's not in Baghdad, but you'll be fine. I will be fine only in Baghdad. That one is violent! That one is violent! Well, so let's have some Fanta, even it's not in Baghdad. You're hired. What the fuck is this? A coup d'?tat? We've just changed our strategy. Conciliation. I'll stop to give you such a good life! Sure! Now it's the odalisque who'll give us the good life. The oil is ours! It's a miracle! The oil is ours! The oil is ours! It's a miracle! The oil is ours! It's a miracle! The oil is ours! My ideal is dancing for Ali Khan in Baghdad, but for now I'm going to dance around here. In order to arrive in Baghdad, my career is going to skyrocket. I've already got the most important thing. My agents. What the odalisque didn't say is that I'm Ali Khan. So she is already dancing for me. Oh, my ministry in decomposition! So it's how you do it, when it's time to do it with me, you complain. Today I always rule! Are you listening? Get down on all fours! Idiots! Assholes! Get down! Take it! Now you can have all the food you want. What is it? I want to share this stuff. No way! This is a democracy. Demagogue! Go fuck yourself, share it, idiot! She's a swindler. How bad! Isn't it? Look at me, little monster, if you continue to conspire behind my back I'll hang you upside down, let you rot and then give you to the garbageman. Did you get it, asshole? That one is violent. You should know that this odalisque thing is going to end. And I'll bake you both and throw a party. Licking my boots won't help then, because I shan't listen to anything. You should help me or you'll eat garbage later. I wanna get some money. Do you wanna help me? Let's rob the cashier, then we'll catch a plane and go away. Please, in terms of folklore I've stopped by Ipanema's band. Please, could you disintegrate? Go fuck yourself in Tiradentes Square, go on, idiot! Always the same shit. Again, to the bathroom! We chose the right way. We will rise. Behave yourself. How could I help you, please? We came here to do business. It may interest you. In my situation, anything helps. What do you want to say? We have to talk somewhere else. Do you know Baghdad? Shut up, asshole! Baghdad! Let's go. I don't know what kind of intense magic your body irradiates that make me crazy like that, woman... Let's end this mess, bitch. Do something. I can't understand this situation. I'm not a civil servant and I want to have a good life. Odalisque, the deal could be easier. I'll give you some money first and then you go away But my price is very high and may not interest you. Who doesn't play little games? Tableware is expensive and people buy it. A trip to Baghdad costs a lot of money. Even so, does it interest you? Of course! It's better to have money in your hand than a pension account. My dream is to dance for Ali Khan in Baghdad, but for now I'm going to dance around here. I did everything wrong! I came because I was called. If it's to listen to a tantrum, mommy here is going away. Someone told me that you could help us. That's totally false. I'm not a helper. Let's get straight to the point. We are looking for an odalisque. Can you get one? If you could imagine... My dear, you're asking the wrong person. I'm the national preference! I'm the national preference! I'm the national preference! I'm the national preference! I'm the national preference! Look at him. You're enjoying it, aren't you? What a shame. You are the biggest blood sucker I know. Don't bother me, woman! I wanna know about the pot! Do you think I'm a cookie fabric? I'm very busy. One day, I'll go away. Bullshit. I'll take the money beating you up. Violent, do you bite, do you? Come here to rip a piece of me. Insane. Stallion. I don't like this nickname. The odalisque disappeared two days ago and we're doing nothing here. Do something. Do you wanna see me doing something, do you? I'll show you what. That one is violent! Violent! Shut up, asshole. Do you wanna know what you gained with the departure of the odalisque? You gained mommy here. It's me who commands again. I will rule this bacchanal. There will even be a time to wake up. I will kill you one day. That one is violent! Violent!
