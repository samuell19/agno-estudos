The Woman That Dreamed About A Man Madame, monsieur? Have you made up your minds? And monsieur? What does it start with? - K. And then R. Hi! Hello! Mummy! I didn't hear you come in. Have you had a nice time? - Yes. Cool! - Look! It's a snow dome. Isn't it lovely? Was it all right? Yes. Are you hungry? - No, I ate on the plane. I think I'll... I think I'll go and lie down. I've got such a headache. Marie's coming round tonight. - Fuck! I'd forgotten! Tonight? Shall I phone to cancel? - No, I just need a lie down. Hi, Rikke. - Hi, K. Is Marie here? - In a moment. OK. Do you think you could plug everything in to recharge? I'd like to take it with me. I'll be off again tomorrow. It was a really great location. - I can see why he likes it. He's got these. Now I'll send him the right ones. I am very pleased with this one. I'll give you your itinerary before I forget. Where the hell did I put it? Jacques will meet you at the hotel. "... Olby..." "Olby Bank..." "There was Olby Bank..." Johan, have you seen my cardigan? It's in the bathroom. "... ran away. The man..." "'And if you do not win the prince's love causing him to forget his mother and father and to think of you all the time, and making the priest join your hands in marriage you will not receive an immortal soul." "The first morning after he marries another your heart will break and you will become foam upon the water". "It is what I want", said the little mermaid, as pale as a corpse.' Now, sleep time. Please read a bit more! It is so good. Daddy will read some more of it tomorrow. Goodnight, mummy. - Goodnight, darling. Hi, K. - Hi. Hi, K! Are you feeling better? - Yes, I'm fine. We had such a nice time the other day. We must do it again soon. Josefine's so sweet! Here you go. - What is it? Proposed locations for the day after tomorrow. Warsaw instead of Milan. I think your flight leaves from terminal 3. I don't want to go. I want to stay here with Josefine and you. Though I know it'll cause problems. No, darling. She can get someone else to do that job. Take it easy. I really can't go. I spend all my time travelling. I have run out of ideas. I am afraid I can't do the job. When do you leave? In 2 days' time? Yes. - You'll only be gone a week. I'll tell Josefine's school we're going away. I'll come along. No! - Yes! We'll have fun. Darling! - No! You know Tomek and you'll have us there. We can support and help you. Of course we'll go. We'll take our best clothes and dine at the best restaurants. Josefine can take her new trainers. She'll love it. We'll do it. The Sofitel Victoria Warsaw. Is this my bed? - There. How nice! You can see the Palace of Culture from here. Comrade Stalin's gift to the Poles. Who's Stalin? He was a wicked dictator. He killed over a hundred thousand million people. But now he's dead too. They rebuilt all this after the war. If it wasn't potato, what was it? - Cold red Polish pasta. It has a 4-star rating. It is a Polish luxury restaurant. Goodnight, darling. I don't want to go to bed yet. - Clean your teeth. No, I don't want to go to bed. - Go on, clean your teeth. OK, pappa. I'm just popping down to reception. Tomek said he'd leave some photos. Ask him to have them sent up. - I'll just pop down for them. What's happened? - I can't understand a word. Daddy fainted. - What? Yes. We waited so long at the restaurant. I had a drop to drink. Where were you? Are you OK? ... What a good doctor! "Drink plenty of water!" How much did you have to drink? Thanks. Why didn't you phone? Where were you? I texted you. Things dragged out. How much did you have to drink? It's very strong stuff. But I am on holiday... - Perhaps you two should go home? No! No, mummy! - Why? But... - Why? Because! No! - Yes, when you are like this. We can have 2 whole days together. We'll take the train to Krakow. How about it? We'll take the train. Yes. - It's a fantastic place. You really make me anxious. Hello? Hi. - Why don't you answer your phone? Because it was switched off. What's up? I am on my way back to the hotel. - The hotel? We're at the station. Our train has just left. What? - For Krakow. We waited at the station. Where have you been? Hi. - Hi, mummy! Why are you late? - A client didn't like my photos. I'm sorry. - Josefine, buy an ice cream. You can keep the change. I've got to go again. What is going on? What? Do you think I'm stupid? What do you mean? - What are you playing at? Damn it! You're lying. We went to where you were working. They said you'd left hours ago. Why are you lying to me? Look at me! Why the lies? Have you met someone else? Have you known him long? Is he down here? Are you going to him now? Are you leaving me? Is that what you're doing? No. No. I... What the hell are you doing, then? - Johan, can we... Do we have to talk about it? Now? Who is it? Tell me! Have I met him? - No. Why are you doing this? I am cracking up. Start talking. Go on. Go on. Can we go home? No, I can't. I think you should go home. Take Josefine home. Go home. Just beat it. Beat it. Can you move her hair away from her face? Sofie, can you hold the railing? Just with one hand. Let's try it like that. Beautiful. Prepare the next shot. The light look great. - And with her hand up like that. That looks really good.
