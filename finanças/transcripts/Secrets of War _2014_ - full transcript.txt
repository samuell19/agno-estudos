One-nil. - One-one. Lambert! Tuur, you're overtaking me! - I'm a lot faster. Come on, get me. I'll catch you. Stand still, if you dare. I'll kill you. Lambert! Wanna bet I can swing up in one go. - Show me. Hey, look. Hold it. What are you doing here? - Just crossing. With that clubfoot? Stop it. - Shut up, worm. You piss off and go back to your own village. It's just a fake. - Run, Lambert! Where do you think you're going? What shall we do with him? - Let's tie him to the tracks. I'll get you, you brats. He's surprisingly fast. Where are they? - Come on, hurry. Where did they go? - They went in here. It's dark in here. Here. Let's go. - Just you wait. I'll get you. Tuur, they're leaving. Tuur? Tuur? Tuur, can you hear me? I'm over here. Tuur. Hey, are you OK? - Yes. Whoa. Look at this. What? - Someone slept here. What's that? - Nothing. Rats. Tuur, come. What's that? - A comic book. It's in English. Andrew. Hey, Tuur... Those guys are gone. Let's go. The coast is clear. That place is our secret, OK? But we're going to find out who was down there. I'll race you to the village. - Yeah, right. Next time I run into them, I'll just shoot them. SECRETS OF WAR Looks a bit like Belgium. - And Greenland. I'm going over to my dad. - See you. Dad! Know what we... - Head on home. I'll be right there. Go away. Me first. - No. Mom! Katrientje, out of the way! Yoohoo, I'm done! - Leo, could you go? It's Tuur's turn. - It's not! But last time... - No arguing, Tuur. Go on. I am done! Are you coming to get me, son? With your beautiful white hair. Ooh, we're going to the fair. Shooting for prizes. Come on. Again? Were you in the cave? All of Farmer Witteman's pigs have been taken away. You will stay away from the caves. You might get lost. I won't get lost. I know every tunnel. Dad, could someone have been...? You'll stay away! We agreed on that. Yes. Don't go there anymore. Do you hear me? That's final. Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy name Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Blackie is already outside. Come on, hurry. Hold my hand. - The British are here to liberate us! No, the British are on their way to bomb Germany. We'll ﬂatten you. We'll ﬂatten all you Krauts! Be quiet! Come on! Come, people. Come on. Come. Careful. Hurry inside. Stay on your feet. Such foul weather. Go inside. Come on. Inside. Hurry. Go on. Inside. - Hurry in, people. Everybody here? Where's Roeland? Found out anything about the cave? - Shh, shut up. Fireworks. It's the fair, of course. Are you going too? Fireworks... - The fair... Hey... - When are you coming over for a drink? We still have that bottle of schnapps. Next week. That'll be nice. - OK. Sleep well. - Good night. Tuur. - Come on. That Roeland in his stupid outfit. - That's his business. It's a Hitler Youth Storm uniform! Nijskens wants to be the Germans' pet. Dad works for the Germans too. - He's a cattle inspector. It's his job and someone has to do it. Off to bed. You too. Loser. - Hey! Dad? - Yes? Bed, now. You need your sleep. I don't want to visit anymore! - It's just for a drink. It would look suspicious if we suddenly stopped going there. You may be right, but I can't stand to look at Nijskens anymore. His sanctimonious face. - I understand. But we can't take the risk. Straight to school. Work hard, son. Of course. I will. Tuur! - Have a nice day, guys. See you this afternoon. - Bye. My dad wants me to join the Hitler Youth Storm, like Roeland. Will you? What do they do anyway? - Sing songs, march. Look. ♪The Youth Storm, stepping like a goose That is what they've been taught to do♪ ♪Roeland already volunteered♪ ♪And that lady's hat looks weird♪ You're a bad loser, Sjeng. Yes! Tuur... - Death to all the Krauts! Tuur Ramakers! Stop that immediately. I don't want to hear the word 'Krauts'. Understood? After-school detention for you. Inside. Go. All of you. Inside. Go. Tuur, how much is 360 minus 42? Not paying attention again? - 300... There. Boys and girls, teacher... This is Maartje Driessen, a niece of the Holtermans family. She's staying with them for a while. And she'll be attending our school. Well Maartje, I hope you'll like it here. Teacher, children... Go and sit next to Lenneke. 318. - Too late. But I... - What? 'I'm must not say Krauts'. 'I'm must not say sprouts'. What? Where did you get this? Did you go into...? - Never mind. Where did you get it? The cave. How many times do we have to tell you? It's dangerous on your own. - But I there was with Lambert. There's more stuff there. Dad, someone stayed there. That's none of our business. - But... You've heard your dad. Go to your room. Coming with me to the cave? - You're not allowed, right? Who cares? - Hey, Lambert. What are you doing this afternoon? - I... Uhm, I... He's coming with me. - We're going to the cave. A cave? You have those around here? We never seen a cave. Can I come? - It's very far away. That's OK. - It's a six-hour walk. I can walk ten hours easily. Why are you acting so stupid? She's never seen a cave. Why should I care? She's really nice. - She can't see our secret spot. Of course not. I'm not crazy. Look. The rock train! Against the window. Man! - See? I hit it three times! Come on, let's go. Hey. Coming? - Yeah. Come on, guys. This way. Up here. It's got miles and miles of tunnels. It's like a labyrinth. if you get lost, you'll never find your way out. Wow. - Yes, marlstone. Made of countless skeletons of sea animals. Millions of years ago. Coming? I thought you wanted to see a cave. Stay close. This way, I think. Stay right behind Tuur. Otherwise you're dead. Your body will decay slowly. And the maggots will eat... ...your skeleton... ...clean! Oh, no. Tuur? Tuur, what's happening? Light that candle again. I'm out of matches. - What? We can't do without light. Do you have matches? - No. Take my hands. We'll make a chain, don't let go. Is this your hand? - Here. Tuur, where are you? Tuur? Tuur? - I'm here, guys. Are you OK? - Yeah. Come on. You saved us. Otherwise the maggots would have eaten our skeleton clean. If I want to go to the Olympic Games, I have to practice much harder. Olympic Games? - Yes. Will you come and watch? Only if you win gold. Don't tell my dad. He doesn't like it. They're looking for fugitives. That's why they're searching the area. There's some kind of a resistance group that helps people. Resistance group? I knew it. What? Do you speak German? No, not really. But you understood what he said. - My grandma is German. A German grandma? - Yes. So what? Then she's a Kraut. - Was! She's dead. And she wasn't a Kraut. She was very sweet. Not all Germans are bad, you know. That's what my dad always says. Wanna bet I can hit the chimney. - Which one? The Germans took the pastor. I'll go and talk to the mayor, OK? I'll lake care of it. Who are you? Maartje, ma'am. I'm staying with my aunt and uncle Holtermans. She lives in lJmuiden. Oh? I didn't know Holtermans had relatives in the north of Holland. Blackie? Blackie? Puss, puss, puss. Where are you? Where are you? Blackie? Blackie? You're hiding, aren't you? From the Germans. He's probably at your house. We'll get him. Oh, no. - Oh, yes! Absolutely not. You're not going to Aunt Anna's house. Let go of me! What's happening to Fons and his parents? - Sweetheart... Back upstairs. - It's fine. It isn't. We have to help them. - Don't be stupid. And who's that man? - Don't worry about it. Go to bed! Are they in the resistance? Come on, upstairs. Did you hear that Fons was arrested? - Yes, someone betrayed them. They were hiding a Jewish man. Their own fault, right? They shouldn't have been so stupid. Coming? Don't look so sanctimonious. You and your Nazi father. Sjeng, don't be ridiculous. - Never mind. Don't listen to them. Hey, Lambert. - Hi. She has a crush on you. - Don't be ridiculous. I'll ask Tuur. Is this one all right? - Put it over there. OK? Come on, guys. Know why it's on the other one's back? - No. They're making love. They do it for hours. That's my aunt's house. Wait here for me. Tuur? What are you going to do? Hey, Blackie. Blackie, come. It's my aunt's cat. She really misses him. Look, my aunt lives in this house. Look, my Uncle Bart. It's my grandpa's brother. He's dead. I made that drawing. I'm Tuur. It's very nice. I made this too. - You are an artist. You can keep it. Did you steal that? - They took my aunt's house, didn't they? Daredevil! Thanks. No, thanks. Let's go. Bye. See you tomorrow. Bye. The apples? - Yes, here. Where's the Colt? Colt? Honey, get that tea towel. Here, the apples. Be careful. - Of course. Book... We'll be back in an hour. Tuur, what are you doing this afternoon? Nothing. And you? - Let's do nothing together. At my place? - OK. Practice a couple of times and you'll be fine. Give my regards to your dad. Whoa. It's huge. Which one is your room? - The one with the open windows. I really have to show you something. Come. Give me a hand. Weren't we going to do nothing? - This is much better. What's that? - My little secret. Her name is Bella. I thought all the pigs had to go to Germany. My uncle hid her for me. She's so sweet. She's in hiding. That's why she's still alive. You can't tell anyone. What is it? I have a secret as well. What's your secret? I won't tell anyone. My mom and dad... ...and Leo too, I think... I think they're in that resistance group. Do they know you know? - No. They just act secretive. I don't understand why they don't tell me what they're doing. Stupid parents. At least you see them every day. Do you miss them a lot? Your mom will get better, I'm sure. Then you can go home again. Come on. What's wrong? My mom... She isn't ill. And my dad isn't too busy either. So why are you staying with Holtermans? This is my real secret. Don't tell anyone. Promise? Not a single soul. I won second prize here. Next time I'll be the champion. We have to sew this onto our clothes, so everyone can tell we're Jewish. JEW Mom and dad. My name isn't Maartje. It's Tamar. Tam Kat. Tamar? I don't live in lJmuiden, but in Amsterdam. This is our house. Maartje? Are you up there? - Yes. I'm coming. He doesn't know I still have these things. Don't tell anyone. - Of course not. Not even Lambert. Can I have a turn? - Yeah. Careful, or the bridge will be over here. You can lower the gates, can't you? - Yes. Switch tracks. - This one. Wait. Stop for a second. Can it pull this? - You bet. Switch it on again, Lambert. It's an S350. German-made, so it's super strong. Dad? The Hitler Youth Storm promoted me. - That's wonderful, son. Congratulations. - Thank you. Now it's your turn, Lambert. Let's go and tell your mom. Drums resound throughout the land marching with the Hitler Youth Storm the ﬂags me waving in our hand the ﬂags of our Fatherland Hitler Youth Stormers Hitler Youth Come on, dad. Hither Youth Storm, on the march! Yes, it's fine. Drums resound throughout the land marching with the Hitler Youth Storm the Youth me waking hand in hand for leader, people and Fatherland Hitler Stormers' Youth Hitler Youth Hither Youth Storm, on the march! Quarter of a turn right. A drink for everyone in our yard. Let's go. Dad, why is Nijskens mayor all of a sudden? Your best friend's dad is chummy with the Krauts. Leo... - It's true, isn't it? Tuur, are you coming too? We have cookies. Just for a little while. - It's almost dinner time. OK. For a little while. I can't forbid it. - You can! You're his father. It's his best friend. And wouldn't it look suspicious? Everyone will understand we don't want our son visiting a collaborating mayor. There's too much at stake. - That's exactly why. Everyone got cookies. I brought you... What? You've been very naughty. You're not allowed to play with your best friend ever again. What's she talking about? - Tuur... Now that Lambert's dad is mayor... - Is that it? Nijskens may be chummy with the Germans, Lambert remains my best friend. Forever! Whatever happens. For the rest of my life! Someone's upset. Stupid war! Stupid bloody war! I saw a child, a little child! What? Where? - The rock train. A little hand was sticking out and threw this on the tracks. They transport rocks, not children. - I saw it with my own eyes. Dad? Why was there a child on that train? I don't know. - You're imagining things. Really? Then what about this? A child in the village must have lost it. I saw it with my own eyes. A hand was sticking out of that train! Dad! Why do you never tell me anything? I really don't know. Sometimes it's best to know as little as possible. Why aren't you playing marbles with the others? Don't feel like it. Stupid bloody war. This is a bird's gastrointestinal tract. Boys and girls, teacher, I finally have news about Fons and his parents. They're fine. They're in a labor camp. Children, teacher... Pay attention. My dad says that a labor camp is like a summer camp... ...with a fence around it. What do people do there? - All sorts of things. Mostly hard work. That Jew they hid is in a different kind of camp. They're transported there by train, and you never see them again. Tuur? Tuur, your turn. My dad will give me my own trainset if I join the Hitler Youth. He has already bought me a uniform. I haven't put it on yet. Listen... Know what I saw last night? - No. Hey Lambert, Nazi buddy. Why don't you go to a German school? If you love Krauts so much. Cut it out, Sjeng. - Stay out of it. Let me through. - Call your daddy. Or your big brother in his uniform. - Watch what you're saying. My dad happens to be the boss of our village. Bring it on. Come on, Sjeng. Get him. Filthy traitor. - Let go of me. Let go of me. - What do you want? Stop that. Both of you. Stop. - I'll get you. Traitor. I'll get you some day. Are you OK? - Yeah. What were you going to say about last night? Nothing. - No, what? I just couldn't sleep. Every angle is 60 degrees. So the sum total of the angles is 3 times 60 degrees... ...is 180 degrees. The three of us were playing cards. I could tell by my dad's face that something was wrong. He was really afraid. We had to come with them immediately. My dad quickly grabbed some photographs. I hid them in a sock in my panties. They took us to a huge building. With a lot of Jewish people. After a while, they came to collect the children. I didn't want to go. But my dad promised we'd see each other soon. And then? They brought me to a doctor. He said my name was Maartje Driessen. Tamar didn't exist anymore for the time being. They took us to the railway station. It was a long journey. I was so scared when the Germans came to check. But I showed them my papers. And I told them my new name. And they believed me. Maartje. I hate that name. It's quite nice. - I'm Tamar! What is it going to be? - Something for you. You'll get it when it's finished. Leo, close the curtains. - We have to go to the shelter, right? We're not going to Nijskens anymore. Come on. Tuur. Why didn't you come to the shelter last night? My dad didn't think it was necessary. How are you? - Fine. Move on. Just sit down. Where were we? Want to play with the trains? No, I can't make it today. Too bad. Sunday after church? - Yes, Sunday after church. See you Sunday. Our thoughts are with the Jansen family who have been transported to Germany. We pray to Our Lord that He will keep them from harm. Whatever happens and whatever the opinion of other people is... ...they remain our fellow villagers. Forever. What Our Lord asks of us in these turbulent times... ...is solidarity. Leo, stop fooling around. What are we doing this afternoon? Your choice. I can't make it. - But you said: Sunday after church. I have to help Katrientje. With her homework. Don't you feel like it? - That's not it. Or are you and Maartje...? - No! I said I have to help Katrientje. Hi. Hey, I said 'hi'. - Oh. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just bored. So why don't you do something with Tuur? Or is he busy chasing girls? Hey, oinkie. I brought Tuur. She's happy we're here. You can tell by her tail. Is she always in this small pen? - Yes. It's too dangerous to let her out. Not even for a little while? BE BRAVE JOIN THE HITLER YOUTH STORM Napoleon introduced a lot of changes in our country. For instance, we all have a last name now and are listed in the birth register. Tuur Ramakers... What was Napoleon responsible for? For the poor little children. You didn't pay attention again. Detention. This is very healthy for a pussycat. Eat something yourself first, aunt. Aunt? Farmer Severijn's cows are gone. We won't have any animals left in the village. All Hitler Youth Storm units of South-Limburg are coming to Maastricht. Feel like going, Lambert? No sausage again? - Hasn't been available for a long time. It's for the German soldiers. They need their strength for fighting. Well, Holtermans still has a fat pig. That's interesting. Soup, Roeland? Hello? Ah, Nijskens. How are you? I see. Maartje! What's wrong? - Only you knew about Bella! What? - They discovered her. The Germans took her away! Do you think I...? - Who else? It was Lambert. Lambert? - Lambert saw Bella. He must have told. The room. Your box. - We looked. It's still there. It's not safe there. It has to go and so do you. Go to the cave. If they discover who you really are, you'll have to go to that camp for Jews. You have to hide, as soon as possible. In the cave. You'll be safe there. I'll come with you. I'm staying with you. All right. But first I want to go and get my box. I'll get some things, some food and come to you as soon as possible. What happened? - They took away the Holtermans family. And Maartje. - They'd hidden a pig. That they take you away for that these days... Lambert! Lambert! Tuur? They took her away. It's your fault! A pig. - They took away Maartje. Maartje? - Maartje, Maartje, you filthy traitor! Tuur, let me go. - No. Bastard! - Let go of me. Filthy collaborator! Hey! What's going on? Stop that immediately. Hey! What's the meaning of this? - Is it true about Maartje? Maartje? - That girl at Holtermans. Oh, her. She's in a prison in Maastricht. What did they do? - Something illegal. They knew full well. Don't let me ever catch you fighting again. It solves nothing. Where are you going? - To Maastricht. Don't. It's too dangerous. - For cowards like you it is. Tuur! Tuur! Dad, you have to help Maartje. I can't, son. - Please. She's a friend. A girl like that is not a friend. She'll be transported to Germany. To a concentration camp. - What? What did she do? She's a Jewess, son, from Amsterdam. Maartje? - Here. Look... Tam Kat. That's her real name. Can I have a look, dad? - Of course, son. Good job, by the way. If you hadn't mentioned that pig, we wouldn't have found this evidence. Get in! Maartje! Tamar! Let me go. Get your paws off me! Let go! Hey, look. The Kraut buddy. Traitor. Filthy collaborator. Lambert... I have to talk to my dad. - Yes, but... It's urgent! Lambert. - Dad. Tuur went to Maastricht. Why? - To the prison. He wants to rescue Maartje. - Has he gone insane? Please, he doesn't know what he's doing. You have to help him before things go wrong. I can't, son. - You're the mayor. The Germans listen to you. I can't. Dad... I'm going to the Hitler Youth Storm Day with Roeland. Tuur Ramakers. I took care of it. Tuur is lucky to have such a good friend. Go home. I'll be right there. And Lambert? You're getting your own train, son. Gentlemen, how may I help you? Tuur! Maartje... They took Maartje. Why? You have to leave. Quickly. They made Holtermans talk. They're picking up everyone. Coats on. - Blackie? Run. This way. Quickly! - Come on. Go back. Hurry. Into the field! Dad, what's going on? A resistance movement right here in the village. Even Ramakers. Go home, son. Hurry. Roeland, we have to stay together! I want to take my afternoon nap. - No, we have to walk a bit further. Come on. Here. Get down. Quickly. Come on. Now. - Yes, hurry. Come on. Stop. Tuur! - Honey... Tuur, give it to me. - No. Have you betrayed us as well? Just like Maartje? Of course not. - You're lying. I never lied. You did. On Sunday you said you had to help Katrientje. If you hadn't lied, I wouldn't have seen that pig. Tuur, you guys have to hurry. The Germans are searching the village and the entire area. Go to Belgium via the cave. Tuur, you know the way. - We'll never make it. We have no food, lights, nothing. Go to the cave. I'll take care of everything and bring it to you. I will. Tuur, I will. I promise. I didn't know. Honestly. About Maartje. I really didn't know. I swear. We'll wait for you in the cave. You know where. I'm sure it's a trap. Let's go that way. I know how to get to Belgium. - They might be waiting for us there. Dad, please. Leo, come on. Where is the hiding place? - In the cave. Come on. Quickly. Come on. Good. Come on, this way. This way. It's here. Go down. Leo, you first. Come on, dad. Light out. Can someone turn on the light? They're gone. Forget it. That friend of yours isn't coming. Told you so. Are you there? - Lambert, we're here! Tuur! These are the supplies. Wonderful. Thank you, Lambert. There you go. - Thanks again. Be careful, OK? - You too. Thank you. Thank you. Tuur, coming? - I'll be right there. This is for you. Yes, this is right. This way. - Come on. Guys, over there.
