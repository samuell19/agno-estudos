Bacon said: "There is nothing apart from the moment." "Without God, humans experience the same natural urges as any other animal." "Violence, lust, fear." I believe in nothing. Bacon said we are meat... Potential carcasses. "I am not interested in fantasy. I am interested in reality." "Reality is what exists." Joshua! Fucker! Ah, you're up. Good timing. I made bacon and egg sandwiches. Do you know which shoes are mine? - Are you okay? - Sure. Awesome. Just heading home. There's lots of shoes on the lower rack. And I don't remember... which are mine. They're all yours. - But I actually... - You're not going anywhere. Come. Okay. Sit. Follow my finger. - I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. - What's my name? It's Andrew. What's your name? Demir. My name is Demir. How did I end up here? You live here with me. Really? Really. Why the fuck am I in the living room? I'm not vomboting my way to 0% body fat just so I can dig my bones into... non-Egyptian cotton couches. That aren't wide enough. What? Am I also talking to my fucking self here? He doesn't remember shit. Like nada. There's no ketchup. Forget about the fucking sandwich. "D" has done a full on factory reboot. Your name is Dougie McDougall and you get pretty girls ketchup for fun. What's wrong with you, moody shoes? Fine, I'll get it myself. Can you throw away the chicken in the fridge? It's gone bad. - Shit, I have to go. - You're leaving? Yeah. Auction at eleven. Eat, D. Food for the mind. Hi. Is he for real? Yeah. Can you just keep an eye on him until I get back? It's great on toast. Not funny. Don't ever eat peanuts. You're allergic. They'll kill you. I'll be back at three. It's food, not art. Can't believe you're pulling this shit. What shit? Pretending you've lost your memory just to get Andrew eyes. Andrew eyes? And don't you think for a moment that this cutie-tootie "Hug the amnesiac" routine is gonna work with him. That guy loves pussy, okay? Brownie points are no points. You'd have to toss your testicles, decap your dick - hello, nerve endings - and make yourself a nice shiny new clitoris, then use your shaft and scrotum as a labia and vaginal canal so he can pork you till he dumps his protein. Until you do that... Stay the fuck out of my way. Capisce? Do I know you? I see the way you look at him! Like he's an egg and bacon fucking butty. You psycho bitch! You little dick pimple! And Demir tried to grab me to stop me from falling and... that's when he fell down too. That's what exactly happened. You kids should take better care. This is going to... be a little minty. Zip me! This is insane. - She'll have a scar. - She might want a scar. - I wish I'd seen it. - What? You two falling down the stairs at the same time. Two. And three. We're done. A true warrior. Wasn't she a warrior, D? A rebel, even. - Yes, a rebel. Without a cause. - I have a cause. I'm going home. You can get back okay? I'll figure it out. Ridiculous. Who keeps a piglet as a pet? The stitches hurt. Yeah. You okay? You seem... I don't know... just different. Yeah. Demir is full of shit, you know. There's no way he's forgotten everything. I don't see why he would lie. He wants attention. Obvi. What's your problem with him? I can't share. Good evening. Well it certainly just got a lot more interesting. What can I do for you, honey? Two Northern Lights, four Green Callies, and a coke. - Diet! - A diet coke. It's gonna be a fun night. Violence motherfucker! Peace, love and unity in a brown paper bag! Bring the motherfucking ruckus! Joshua! And what makes Andrew so special? You can't go in there. I'm a part of him. I'm Drew. Then Andrew says, "Open your legs." Andrew says, "Wider." Now take a pill. The others were to share. Oh, but you can't share. So take the rest. All of them. Andrew says. Demir! D! Is he here? Doesn't seem to be. Joshua is not here either. He must be walking him. Then we have some time. Someone's coming up. Let's fuck... before he comes back. Wait for me in my room. Don't be too long. This bird is flying high. What are you doing? I'm looking for something to kill you with. What? I said, "I'm looking for something to kill you with." Oh. I want you to murder my pussy. Your scent... What's that for? It's for you. Only for you. Quiet Joshua! - I'm invisible. - Demir! Don't mind me. I'm leaving. I'm really rushing! I'll get you some water. Joshua was hiding under your bed. So I went under there to... - Hide! - No! You just came home when I was already under... - Where are you going? - I thought it was obvious... Anywhere. Have a joint with me. But you're busy. She's there for keeps. You were really going to, weren't you? With the golf club. Uh-huh. Does that bother you? I mean she tried to kill me this morning. And so you hid the knives. Why didn't you just fight back? I tried. But then you hid the knives, and then you hid yourself. - Drew thought you were faking. - What? About your memory. She thought you were seeking attention. And what did you say? That I didn't believe you were faking. Good. 'Cause I'm not. When did I move here? You moved in a week ago. And... ...is Drew... your girlfriend? Girlfriend? Like, do we hold hands across restaurant tables... and kiss in the back in movie theaters? - No, I meant... - No. But... you have sex and stuff? Sure. Sex, and murder and stuff. What? Did you wanna... before I kill her? No, thanks. Why does everyone in this house want to kill someone? Mi casa es su casa. Everybody's fucking "casa." Can't you just leave her? I mean tell her to go. Why kill her? Why not! Rock! 2-0. I win! No killing Drew. Best of 5! - Stop cheating. I won! - Okay fine. Fucking pacifists! Drew! I'm not gonna kill you anymore. Kiddo here is a pro at rock paper scissors. In a world where nothing happens by chance. Miss... You've been in an accident. Everyone hides a secret. You ready? Zip me! - One man. - I'm an auctioneer. I live mostly most in the past. One girl. We all do. - I was running away. - And you ran right into me. Two poisons. I already feel like I'm a part of you. Andrew says, "Wider." One desire. I had to do things to feel alive. Terrible things. And now? Now I want you to feel alive too. His dark passion. Kill them, and then we can go to the same place when we die. With the same sins! Her dark stain. I will be whatever you want me to be. But nothing... - I hear you're an expert. - I'm a lot of things. ...stays secret forever. I miss my sister! When bonds... Who is he? ...they need to be severed. Sorry to cut in like this! You don't know the meaning of "together." Love hurts. Obsession kills. Join me... to you. Rebel Instinct. Available on August 20th. Fine. Got it. And what are you planning to open on? I'll start the bidding at five. That low? Yes that low. When they see who it belonged to, it will be popcorn out there, you do realize? Nobody has any idea who it belonged to. - Join in early, all right? - Was planning to. - And what's my ceiling? - Thirty is what you said. - Good. - So we're all set, then. - Actually make it forty. - Wise. All right, yeah I'll see you on the floor. That's the most retard thing I've ever seen. Who'd put a rat trap on their belt? That's not a rat trap. It's a Nazi belt buckle pistol. And tonight that baby is gonna be mine. You're getting a gun? Relax. I'm just going to resell it. Can't you just get this instead? It looks like a throne. English Georgian gilt armchair? Kid's got taste. But it'll go for value. I won't be able to make anything off of it. Can't you just get it to sit on? I still don't see why you can't sit there. It doesn't feel right. Joshua! Away from there! Can't we just bury her? I don't do spades. We can pay someone who does do spades. And tell them what? No look... I'll handle it. Just not right now. Wait wait... Isn't it strange that she hasn't started... I don't know... rotting or something? What moisturizing cream did she use? Cherry Cola. Not now. I'll walk you when I am back. Well if it isn't Mr. Erotic melodrama! Once. I asked for erotic melodrama once. How's the Francis Bacon presentation going? It's tomorrow. - Yeah? You ready? - I'm here, aren't I? So... did it come in? - You gotta get a new hobby kid. - This really isn't a hobby. - Of course it came in. - Can I have it? I have to see it. Or I am gonna die. Fuck! They're supposed to be rewritable. It said so on the fucking label. - Hey! Like clockwork you are! - Hey! Sure you didn't touch these? Jesus, I swear to god, his fucking finger grease is corrosive. How am I supposed to put them in and take them out if I can't touch them? I don't know. Maybe buy some medical gloves. You have a copy for me, though, right? I have a grand total of zero copies and no rewritable fuck-ass disks! But you said I could have it! - Give him the master copy. - Thank you. Thank you so much. But it's got to be back by 12:00, okay? Cause we've got to get the copy run done tonight as soon as we get some new blanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. Okay back by 12:00 or it turns into a pumpkin. Yeah, sure! Or a gremlin. Can't you just get another one? That belt buckle pistol belonged to Goebbels. - Who the fuck is that? - The founding father of modern advertising. He had a belt buckle pistol? Advertising is pretty screwed up. So what do you remember? I was inside a video store. They gave me a film. Anything else? Uh-uh. You know what's weird? I don't even know if I'm a virgin or not? That is weird. There's really only one way to find out. Sex is like a golf swing. You don't forget the motions. Emotions? You have emotions playing golf? Motions. Your body remembers stuff even if your mind doesn't. That's why I try not to think too much. Being in my body is much more satisfying than being in my head. You sure you're not hungry? No. I had a baguette. So what's the deal with you and Bacon? The painter, not the sandwich. I dunno. I mean in life there are all these... dimensions. But in his art, he left them out. So you can put in your own. If you don't, you're just afraid of what you see there. So you don't think he paints with rage? No. If you see rage, then it's in you, not in the painting. And what about you? What about me, what? What do you feel? Fear. Like "run away" fear? Or "look closer" fear? I want to know more. ...the fuck? I was hungry. I thought you said you had a baguette. What? It was more of a Petit Pain. You done? Okay, Mr. Petit Pain. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have seen this. You need a shower. I don't wanna get wet. Pretty hard not to in the shower. Aren't you forgetting something? Good. Careful. Relax. I'm not the kind of guy who gets cold hands. There we go. We'll have you squeaky-clean again in no time. I just hope you got it all out. Or you're going to be sick for a while. What? I can't. Let me know if you need anything. Demir. D. I don't get it. What the fuck is going on? He's inside the Videodrome. When did that happen? I think that's the point. You can't be sure when the real world becomes the Videodrome world. I thought Videodrome is the only world. Was that a line of dialogue? I guess. "I guess." There's enough in there for another draw. Baby dragon. Here. Munchies. No, thanks. I hope you are not bulimic. It's not that, it's just... Whatever. Spit it out. For Christ's sakes I just can't eat near you. Why? You're just so perfect. I feel like a manufacturing defect every time I look at you. Open it. Andrew says. Come out with me. Rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10. With 1 being no pain... and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine. Because of the girls? I just don't know what you want from me. Look, I can't tell you why I do some stuff, okay? Stuff happens and I just let it. I don't want you to not do what you want. No, you just want me not to want it. Doesn't matter anymore. That night you lost your memory. It wasn't just about you. Something changed for everyone. I began to feel like I was two people, and I still feel like I'm two people. Like, I'm looking at you, but then I turn around and I see myself. Or someone like me. Maybe it's best if you just live somewhere else. Is this what you actually want? Or are you just letting stuff happen? How can you tell? Well, if you can't, it's not important I hear you're an expert. You want Andrew. He's not here. Please. I came directly from the airport. It's very important. - Will he be back soon? - I don't know. I guess. Would you mind if I waited here? Jeremy Van Der Wilt. I'm a collector. My card. I have something which I think will be of interest to Andrew. I'm kind of in the middle of something. - Please. - You are not a doctor? What? No. Why? Do you need a doctor? I definitely don't need a doctor. Come in. Don't take your shoes off. There might still be some glass on the floor. You have a problem with your back? No, it's with the couch. Who might you be, exactly? Nobody. I'm moving out. How long does an allergy take to happen? After exposure to the allergen? I always thought it was instantaneous. Why? I ate this. I see. I would say that you are not allergic to peanuts in that case. My sister had a peanut allergy, and the symptoms came on pretty quickly. Great. I can't even kill myself properly. And that's like two thousand Calories. Is there something you'd like to talk about? What do you do when you find out that... the only person you exist to be with doesn't want to be with you? Apart from kill yourself you mean? Daa. Hmm, well. Maybe ask yourself why you existed only to be with... that person in the first place. That's like asking Romeo why he... doesn't just hook up with Jolene. Who's Jolene? Exactly. I'm moving out tomorrow. I gotta go... D! I want Mr. Van Der Wilt to stay here for a few days... while I check the provenance on his painting. Would you mind if I gave him your room? You can stay on the couch tonight. Sure. I missed my sister. What did you expect me to do? Just forget about you? It's a passing thing. You'll get bored of him, or he will you. I don't care if he wakes up. Let him see what real love looks like. I won't let anyone tear us apart again. Let me in. Or I'll destroy everything. I'll kill and I'll kill again until it's just you and me. I want you back. I want my sister back. It's fifty-eight! I made it. And you can check it. There's like no scratches at all. - How was it? - So, so good. But he was mean. I've never seen him play someone mean. Normally, he's so heavenly. But in this one he was mean. Which I like. Sign of a good actor. Shows he's got range, right? Yeah. Let's get this thing duplicated. You got time? D'you wanna see the copy factory? Sure. I almost wish no one else could see it. You're fucking nuts. Come on. Nyet. Nyet. Okay. Spasibo. The Tretyakov say the same. There's no record of a fifth Or of Malevic ever mentioning one. But it makes sense, no? If you consider the story about his mother. Yeah. But we need proof. If you can get your hands on a diary or letters. - Anything that mentions a fifth. - I need to talk to you. There's one other source I can check. Wait. What time are you planning to leave? - I need to talk to you first. - Pretty busy now. Can you stop by tomorrow after you've moved your stuff? I'm sure you'll forget something. No offense. Quite beautiful, isn't it? It's all concept, no craft. I'd say free from the chains of craft. Because you're trying to sell it. Malevic could paint... make no mistake. But... he was obsessed with nothing. - The beginning and the end. - Looks more like the end to me. Well, who am I to argue? But fun fact: Did you know that beneath the paint of one of the sister pieces, they found written: "Battle of the negroes in a dark cave"? Necros? As in necrophiliacs? I suggest you take Andrew's advice and forget something. You may leave now if you leave now. So, what do you think, D? Real or fake? Demir has an interest in art too. A bit of a Francis Bacon addict. "We are meat. Potential carcasses." Fake! Definitely fake! Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bath this morning. Let's see if we can't prove him wrong I'm sure you've got lots to do yourself. I can't leave you alone with him. He wants to hurt you. Wrong side of the bath, indeed. I told you I had another piece that I wanted to show you. - Nazi belt buckle pistol! - You know your antiques. It is loaded, I might add. 22 LR gauge. Designed by Louis Marquis and owned by? Joseph Goebbels. My man picked it up for a mere forty-one thousand. - But you already know this. - What do you want? He's Drew's brother. He found her body. - I saw them together. - You don't know the meaning of together. Open the sofa. I want her to see this. Hi, honey bee. How are you? I thought as much. Are you ready for some fun time? There are a lot of opinions about what makes great sex. But for Drew, it was always simple: Multiple orgasms. How many times do you think I could come, D? D! How about a hint? How many Black Squares did Malevic paint? - Four... - Five! He painted five. That is not a fake, you little dick pimple. And there are four shots in this thing. And one sweet load of mine. Don't you dare so much as make a squeak again. Now you... Syphon me! - No! - Let it go, D. Fucking gerbils! It's "Goebbels." Yeah. Fuck him too. Woah. Check this out. Him and Drew were Siamese twins? Looks that way. I never wanna see a double baby again. Whoo. If I ever needed a line. You still not gonna sit on the couch? - You want one? - Yes, please. Can I ask you something? What changed? Why now? With us, I mean. - We have the same sins now. - What do you mean? I'm a killer. You're a killer. - Only that? - It's important to me. But the girls at the nightclub? I wanted you to kill them with me but you left before I could ask. You okay with that? I don't care what you do. Just what you do to me. Are you sure you won't join me on the couch? - I win. - You did. But how can you be so sure? Virgins don't fuck over dead bodies. Not even really horny virgins? Okay, maybe really really horny virgins. That was me. I was popcorn. There is something that keeps bugging my head. Why did Drew try to kill me that time? Why did you want to kill her brother? But I did that to protect you. That is exactly what Drew would have said standing over your dead body. And what happened the night before? The night before I lost my memory? What the hell was that? - What? - You, I don't know... buzzed. - What you mean "buzzed"? - You flickered, like a bad TV! - Are you high? - No. I mean yeah. But I'm not tripping. - So? - So, what? What happened the night before I lost my memory? Are you high? What happened the night before I lost my memory? You're fucking nuts. Come on. Right on time. Fifty copies. Set it up. Are you gonna watch it while you copy? I'll stay. I can see it five times in a row, I don't care. Fives times, huh? It's running. You're gonna record me watching the film? Mic test! Okay, good. All set. Actually, I just remembered, I need to go through my Bacon presentation. - I should go. - Camera's rolling. It's locked. Fucking pussy. Okay. Get his fucking legs. The fucker's like an eel. No! No! No! Now, get his fucking pants off! You taste like honey. Give me the handle bar. Quick! Calm down. Calm down. Come on. Relax. You go. Go first. Take the handlebars. Take them. Not so hard. He's gonna pass out. - Come on. - I can't, he's too tight. Relax, Mr. Erotic melodrama. Yeah! Fuck yeah! I don't want to find any fucking broken glass on this floor. Man, that is just beautiful. It's fucking perfect, man. Look at that. Squealing like a pig. Definitely next time, you could put the camera a little bit to the other side. The wide would look so cool... Yeah. Great. I thought you were gonna pop his Adam's apple at some point. I remember everything. I knew it was too good to be true. What? You. Us. I knew you wouldn't like me in real life anyway. What are you talking about? I collected all your films. I heard you saying you'd never leave me more times than you said anything else. Things are easier outside when I come back home to you. When I talk to you... like you were real. But I am. For me, you are. You're the only real thing. Join me... to you. Stay happy now.
