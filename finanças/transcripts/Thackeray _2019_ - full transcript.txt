The situation is pretty tense all over Lucknow. What's the crowd gathered for? The city of Lucknow has transformed into a campsite. -What did he do? -Remember the Babri Masjid incident? -Yeah. -That was him. Just by looking at the crowd gathered here, one can understand how high-profile this case is. Someone's coming all the way from Mumbai. Is it Amitabh Bachchan? He's been accused of demolishing the Babri Masjid. He wasn't involved in the Babri Masjid demolition, right? But he was supporting the ones who were. The country is eagerly waiting for the verdict. His supporters have gathered here in large numbers just to catch a glimpse of him. If it wasn't for him, this country would still be witnessing turmoil. Sir. The CBI claims that Babri... Was he involved? -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! Sir, you've been accused of demolishing the Babri Masjid... Move. Can't you see? Move! Move back, come on. And you're being charged for the same. Move back! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT, LUCKNOW. -Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. -Hello. -Hello, sir. Please state your full name to the Honorable Court. Bal... Keshav... Thackeray. Make sure you deposit the cheque today. THE SPARK. FREE PRESS - 1969. Rosy, did they get the front-page layout? -Find out if they did. -Okay, sir. The classified is confirmed. Just fax me the designs. Okay, sir. Govind, get me a filter coffee. Here, Deshpande. There's a condolence meeting at the Town Hall at 7:00 p.m. One of us dies and all we do is observe two minutes of silence to pay homage. We should be ashamed of ourselves. In fact, we shouldn't be silent at all. Calm down, Thackeray. We are lucky that we're the only Maharashtrians in this office. It's rather unfortunate. Sir. What is it? The boss is asking for you. Jairam. How does it look? I can never make sense of your drawings. But they do make me laugh. You can't make sense of my caricatures, can you? Then do this. First, laugh your heart out... and now imagine this. Visualize a watermelon... with spectacles. Who do you think that is? Sit, Mr. Thackeray. Please sit. Your cartoons are becoming sharper. I am pleased to know that you understand my cartoons. Do me a favor and leave SK Patil alone! Nijalingappa has made my life miserable. And Morarji is completely off-limits. You start a fire and I pay the price. Thackeray, this press is not for you alone. It helps feed countless other families. So please stop trying to shut it down. If you restrict me from using any of these models... then who am I going to use for my caricatures? Thackeray, I do not doubt your skills. But this press is dependent on advertisements and good relations. Why are you trying to ruin my business? I know you think you're your own boss. But I have superiors to answer to. I have to listen to them. I love my job. That's the problem, sir. People love their jobs, not their work. You can love your work all you want! But let me do my job. I am tired of explaining it to you, but you just don't get it-- I... am an artist. Not a laborer. Yes. Yes, sir. It will be done. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thackeray. What... This is what my cartoons have to tell you for not liking them. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Looks like he won't buy one. We are lucky that we're the only Maharashtrians in this office. It's rather unfortunate. We are lucky that we're the only Maharashtrians... -It's rather unfortunate. -...the only Maharashtrians. -It's rather unfortunate. -...we're the only Maharashtrians. ...the only Maharashtrians in this office. We have Idli, Dosa, Medu Wada. What do you want? A cup of tea, please. Here you go. And hurry up. What are you doing? You're spilling food all over me. Get lost! Get up, you hillbilly. That's my seat. Hey, get up! That's my seat. Move! Today's opening rate is four rupees and fifty paise. Today's opening rate is four rupees and fifty paise. Hurry up. Place your bids. -Hey, have you seen Marathi? -Excuse me, sir. -Marathi, where's my tea? -Coming, sir. -My money? -What money? -Money for the tea? -Get lost! -Please pay for the tea. -Get out of my face. -My money... -What money? Get out! I finally got my salary! The world is bright With the sparkling stars... -Hey, sonny boy. -Mr. Khan? You borrowed money from me to celebrate Diwali. Now you got to pay the interest! My money! Milk belongs to the Bhaiyas, Idli to the Annas, cinema to the Punjabis... tea to the Iranians, bakery to the Parsis, mutton to the Muslims. And yet this is a diverse India. They own the newspapers but they need Maharashtrians to deliver them. This is not fair. They think Maharashtrians are mere hillbillies... but it's time we show them otherwise. They are the immigrants. Mumbai and Maharashtra belong to the Maharashtrians. Watch where you're going! Are you blind? Such a fool! You're not ready yet? I forgot to tell you. I... I quit my job yesterday. At least he told you. Father. So, what are you planning to do next? I am thinking of starting a weekly caricature magazine. Here. Shrikant will assist me. Go ahead. It runs in the family, doesn't it? Take me for instance. I did more for others than for my own. That's why I earned everything but money. I can only give you my blessings. What about the finance? What is the language of the magazine? You won't get a loan for Marathi magazine. I want to stay in the business. I can't go against the market. And what about the mortgage? Who will read a Marathi magazine? ...two. Gopal, you're heading to Gaiwadi, aren't you? -Yes, brother. -Three... -Keep these in the storeroom. -Take this as well. -And don't forget to collect the money. -Yes, brother. Please come in. Greetings. -How are you, Bajirao? -Fine. What brings you here, Bal? We're thinking about starting a weekly magazine. I see. We've been to numerous banks... -I am sure Father told you everything. -Yes, he did. We... need some money. How much? 5,000 rupees. -5,000? -I'll return it soon. 5,000... How is Prabodhankar? He's fine. Here you go. Here. Count it. And two more... Here you go. -Uncle. -Yes? It's 5,200 rupees. Here's the extra 200. Bless us, Uncle. The magazine should be a hit! By the way, what is the name of your magazine? THE STROKES. MARMIK PUBLISHING - 13 AUGUST 1970. On this auspicious day, I'd like to request the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Mr. Yeshwant Rao Chauhan, to inaugurate... the first edition of Marmik. A respected speaker... writer, teacher, editor... and a man of many more such titles... my dear friend, Mr. Prabodhankar Thackeray's son has started Marmik. And I am extremely delighted about it. And after seeing the cover page of Marmik, I am sure that it will give a new identity to Prabodhankar. In fact, it is so good that pretty soon the citizens of Maharashtra will only recognize him as Bal Thackeray's father. The word "Marmik" means poignant... yet, the magazine's humor is sharp and serious. And one can be sure of that by simply looking at the cover page. My best wishes to Marmik. I hope it will be read by every Marathi. WAKE UP, MAHARASHTRIANS. LISTEN TO THE REVOLUTIONARY THOUGHTS OF MARMIK'S EDITOR, MR. BAL THACKERAY, AT AMAR HIND COMMITTEE. One can't even sleep peacefully around here. Why did he have to move the board? Stupid. Yes, I am Thackeray! After reading my articles and seeing my cartoons you all must be thinking, "Who is this phony man... THE BEGINNING. AMAR HIND COMMITTEE - 1963. ...trying to preach revolution? Is he a gangster?" If being honest is a crime, then I am a gangster. I would rather snatch my rights than beg for them. A man's strength and courage is not measured by the size of his chest. Strength lies in the mind and till now, we have let others use it. Be it the Mughals, the British, or the other invaders. We stood there with our hands folded in front of them. And we still do the same. Salaam, Anna. Salaam, Panna. Salaam, Iyer. Right, Uncle? You are our guests. We welcome you with open arms. But if you try to steal our jobs... we won't spare you! It's time we do something about it! We're done respecting them! Did you hear that? Violence is not the answer. Those bloody South Indians! They are always together. They drink together. They also help each other run their businesses. And we spend most of our lives doing more harm than good to each other. You can stay here if you want. I am leaving. If one of us does better, we envy them. They hire their own people to do the dishes at their food stalls. And when one of us starts the same business, we criticize. "Isn't it less salty? Isn't it less oily?" When are you going to rekindle that fire in your heart? We're done honoring them! It's time to strike where it hurts! This is how he started, by giving provocative speeches. Provoking the youth, sparking riots, that's what he-- Can you do something about the loud noise? What? Can you do something about the loud noise of the fan? Switch off the fan. When things go bad, they make a lot of noise. How old are you? -What kind of a question is that? -Tell me. What is your age? -I am 35. -35. At the age of 35, you're a lawyer. You're representing the CBI in court. That's good. However, you're here only because you received good education. But when you'll see someone more educated than you unable to afford one square meal for his family... you'll know the true meaning of hunger. When there are no means to overcome this hunger... it takes down the entire society. You've always been -a supporter of violence. -No. It's just that, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The nameboard should only have Marathi text! Hey, stop it! -Idli Wada! -Hey, you! -Leave! -Get out of here! -We won't tolerate this anymore! -Leave! They deserve this. Exactly. These immigrants take our jobs. Every single one of them needs to be thrashed. You're wrong. You think violence will get us jobs? Hey... you've been looking for a job, right? Did you get one? No, right? And you won't get one. If we still do nothing, these immigrants will screw us. Violence is the only way we'll get jobs. No vacancy. First take a look at your educational qualifications. -Who will give you a job? -I have no vacancy. Your educational qualifications are not good enough. We're looking for someone to work as a domestic. No, we don't employ Maharashtrians. The ball hit the window! -Oh, no! -Run! -Why did you hit the ball so hard, Uncle? -Oh, Lord! What's going on? Stop playing cricket. Who broke the glass? It wasn't me. It was Saheb. No! Such a tattletale! Seriously? Now who's going to clean up this mess? Come on! Just let us play. Give me the ball. You're so stubborn! -Out. You're out. -No, I am not. -That was a six. -No! -That was a six. -You're out. I am not giving up the bat. Forget it, kids. -He won't budge. -I am not out. -That was a six. -Come on. Play all you want. I am here to clean the mess, aren't I? Wait. I'll check. Wait a minute. What do you want? I want to meet Mr. Thackeray. -What for? -Dutta... I am Bal Thackeray. Want me to come to the police station, or can we talk inside? Let's talk inside. Okay. Let's go inside. Let the kids play outside. Come in. The South Indian community have incurred huge losses due to your speeches. We have received a lot of complaints. Those complaints must be against me. You should have arrested me. -Why come all the way-- -So... you're here to arrest me? No. Not yet. Their restaurants are incurring losses so, we'll have to file a report against a few people. You know we have to deal with tremendous pressure. And our seniors are immigrants as well. But I admire the way you work. That's why I really wanted to meet you. We're the police. We can't take sides. These immigrants come into our state and rule over us-- I know all about it. I've been through it. But I'll have to report it. However, you won't face any problems. See you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Let's go. But, sir, the DCP had sent us here to investigate. Shinde, he is thinking about the benefit of our people. We cannot be investigating him. Marmik's latest edition! -Read and keep quiet! -Hey, give me one. Marmik's latest edition! READ AND KEEP QUIET. THE STATE TRADING CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED. What? -Is Mr. Thackeray home? -Yes. -Grandpa! -Yes? -Someone is at the door. -Who is it? -Yes? What do you want? -Are you Bala Saheb Thackeray? Bala "Saheb"? Yes, Bala Saheb is home. I'll get him for you. Bala Saheb! Someone is here to see you. Father... -Yes? -You're doing a great job. We always knew that Maharashtrians are being exploited. But now we know who the exploiters are. Sir, this is a list of all the immigrants in our office. Sir, I want to work with you. Sir, it's been ten days. My daughter has not come back home. I heard that she got married to a Muslim... and now she has moved to Bhindi Bazaar. I beg you, please bring her back home. I've been asking for a water connection for the past seven years. After using the loo, he keeps his bucket in front of my house! I had enough of it... so I stabbed him. My wife hasn't been keeping well. Why are you against democracy? This is my area, he should stay in his. Alright, I will take him back. Can you please call up the DCP? We're organizing a community prayer meeting. Don't you believe in democracy? -I will punch him. -There will be free food as well. You should publish this in Marmik. You have to do something about him. And I am telling you... I'll be transferred immediately. If he comes home drunk again, I won't spare him. Don't you think what you're doing is hooliganism? Will you keep dealing with their problems at home... or have you thought about starting an organization to help them? Yes, Father. But not at home. To work for the people, I'll have to become a part of them. I'll have to bring them together. And for that, I must come up with an organization. For the Marathis, Mumbai, and Maharashtra. Then what are you waiting for? Sooner the better. -Ramesh, go get a coconut. -Yes. Perfect timing! What? What do you mean? We're setting up an organization. Really? That's great. -Please get some sweets. -Sure. So, we have decided to form a new organization. But what will be the name of the organization? Name? Well, the name... I haven't thought about it. Father, why don't you suggest a name for the organization? An organization? It will be an army. Go ahead. You have the blessings of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! THE RISE. FOUNDATION DAY - 19 JUNE 1966. -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! THE IMMIGRANTS HAVE SNATCHED AWAY OUR JOBS. IT'S TIME TO RETALIATE. JOIN SHIV SENA.

And the state of Maharashtra doesn't belong to weaklings. We're born tigers! Anyone who has ever challenged a tiger... has had to face dangerous consequences! Bal. Till now, my son only belonged to the Thackeray family. But now, Bal belongs to Maharashtra... and I pledge him to you towards a unified India. -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Hail Goddess Bhawani! -Hail Shivaji! To control the intrusion of the immigrants... we'll soon begin the enrollment for Shiv Sena. For more information, read the next edition of Marmik. Editor: Mr. Bal Thackeray. -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! -Glory to... -Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Saheb! -Glory to... Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! Uncle! Here, have a sweet. Sir, please help me. What happened? My family has always been in the milk business. I spent my hard-earned money to buy a house. Two years ago, I rented it out but now they refuse to vacate the place. Who are you talking about? They're goons. They run a gambling den there. I tried to reason with them, but they say they are "his" men. What do you mean? Who are you talking about? Bala Saheb. -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! Wait here, Uncle. I'll talk to him. Move. Saheb, some people have forcefully taken possession of his house. And they claim that they are our men. -Take the address. -Yes, sir. -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! Come, Uncle. Please give me the address. Give me a pen. Sutarwadi, house number 19. Saheb, this is a list of our nominees. Saheb. -Is this okay? -Yes. Saheb, are we contesting for the municipal corporation elections? Yes. So? It's time we do something other than protesting. We have to stop begging the corporators to get the work done. Now, my soldiers will become the corporators and work for the people. But, sir, you never told us anything. I just did. Now get to work. Sir... I am indebted to you. Someone who troubles the weak can never be one of us. -Long live Maharashtra. -Long live Maharashtra. Long live Maharashtra. May I speak with Mr. Thackeray? -Who is this? -Manohar Joshi. Just a minute. Joshi. What happened? Saheb, Balwant Mane from our party... Tell me. Saheb, he... What is it? Tell me. He has called for a meeting at the Vanmali Hall at 5:30 p.m... against you. He's also distributing circulars against you. We must do something about him. Okay. Okay. The party's further plan of action should consider everyone's approval. And for that, it's crucial to have democracy within the party. We won't let Shiv Sena be controlled by one man. -We won't tolerate dictatorship. -Grab him! -Hit him! -No! No! Let go of me! How dare you speak against Saheb! Saheb... -Saheb... -I won't accept... democracy in the party. Are you against democracy? Where is democracy? Which democracy are you talking about? According to me, only two types of democracies exist. One, where you stay quiet and endure everything. Two, where you don't endure injustice and raise your voice. Where you fight for your rights and for justice. If the same law applies to everyone in this country... and everyone is indeed treated equally... and that this democracy views everyone as one... then why wouldn't I believe in it? I agree that different religions have different laws here. If democracy treats everyone the same, why wouldn't I believe in it? In fact, I did believe in democracy. Where was democracy when Kashmiri Pandits were driven out of Kashmir? Isn't Kashmir a part of this country? Aren't Kashmiri Pandits a part of us? The water of Sutlej is causing mutiny between Punjab and Haryana. Even today, the people of Belgaon and Karwar... are demonstrating to be a part of Maharashtra. 106 people sacrificed themselves so that Mumbai could be a part of Maharashtra. Where was your democracy then? And how many more sacrifices will it need for it to stay alive? We celebrate Republic Day on 26th January. Where was your democracy on one such 26th January... when countless innocent lives were lost? Belgaon and Karwar will have to be a part of Maharashtra! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! THE STRUGGLE. BELGAON DEMONSTRATION - 1969. -We want... -A unified Maharashtra! 26th January is their last day. If the Belgaon issue isn't resolved by then... I warn the Chief Minister, the Home Minister, and the Vice President, Mr. Morarji Desai... that they will not be allowed in Mumbai... as well as the rest of Maharashtra. Who is Thackeray to stop me? Mr. Yashwant Rao, my Mumbai tour will continue as scheduled. Make proper arrangements. Sir, his goons had stopped his car in Mumbai. There's a lot of anger amongst the people of Maharashtra. And the people of Belgaon and Karwar have come out on the streets. The decisions taken in the interest of the country must be followed. If someone takes a decision against the government... that person shall be dealt with accordingly. If he fails to behave, the government will not hold itself back. Take strict actions if you have to. Sir, he is the one who inaugurated Bal Thackeray's weekly magazine. What does Thackeray think of himself? Gentlemen, I don't care about any of this. Do whatever is necessary. Who is in charge of the police? Modak. Is he a Maharashtrian? No, he has a Maharashtrian last name. His full name is... Emanuel Modak. Dutta Salvi... Tell Mr. Thackeray that I don't want to see any of his people near Mr. Morarji Desai. His people? Bala Saheb is personally going to hand over his appeal to Mr. Desai. So he better collect it. We have only one demand. Belgaon, Karwar are a part of Maharashtra... and they always will be. Lower your voice. Don't forget you're talking to a Deputy Commissioner. This is the lowest my voice can be. Dutta... -Do you see how he's misbehaving? -What do you mean? -Dutta. -Joshi-- It will be fine, just calm down. Sir, we want to hand over this appeal very peacefully. "Peacefully"? You just have to deliver our message to him, that's all. But keeping things in order will be your responsibility. Yes... we'll see. What do you mean? Well, if he accepts our request, everything will be in order. Yes. Fine. I will convey your message to him. See you. -Why did you have to join your hands? -Sometimes, you have to. Saheb shall personally handover the appeal tomorrow. And Morarji must accept it. Got it? -Don't you forget that. -Let's go, Uncle. -Glory to... -Bala Saheb! THE OUTRAGE. MAHIM CAUSEWAY - 7 FEBRUARY 1969. Move! Stay back! -Glory to... -Bala Saheb! -We want... -A unified Maharashtra! -We want... -A unified Maharashtra! -We want... -A unified Maharashtra! -Go back... -Morarji, go back! -Go back... -Morarji, go back! -Go back... -Morarji, go back! -Go back... -Morarji, go back! If the cavalcade doesn't stop, we won't stay quiet. Saheb, what now? Attention! The cavalcade won't stop. Stop them! Hey, stop! Saheb! He said that Morarji's car won't stop here! Saheb, he said he won't accept the application! Move back! Move! -Move! -Saheb, get in the car. -No way! -Saheb, please get in the car. -Forget about me, stop them! -Saheb, please get in. -Take care of our men. -Yes, Saheb. Get in the car. -Don't indulge in violence! -Yes, Saheb. Please just get in the car. -Move! -Take care of our soldiers. Yes, Saheb. Dutta's here, he will handle everything. Let me have a word with the police. Let me get down! Stop the car! Go, Saheb. Hey, let's go. Come on. Come on, Modak. Let's move. I said move now. Move aside! Make way! Move! Hurry up! Move! Let's go! Go! Hurry up! Move it! Move! Hurry up! Break it down! Come on, break it down! Light it up! This is the consequence of your democracy. Bala Saheb has been jailed! Shut down everything! I said shut it down! Come on! Bala Saheb's been jailed! Shut down everything! WE WON'T LET PEACE PREVAIL IN MUMBAI UNTIL BALA SAHEB IS SET FREE. VASANT RAO NAIK. CHIEF MINISTER, MAHARASHTRA. Mr. Vasant Rao, who is running Mumbai? What the hell is your police force doing? Sir... we deployed the entire police force. Everything is under control. But the report says otherwise. Mr. Vasant Rao, do what it takes, but bring the situation under control. I want Mumbai to be peaceful again. Call Modak. Now who's going to tell him that it's not in our hands? There's only one man who can bring the situation under control. THE OPPRESSION. YERAWADA PRISON. George... I had faith in Mr. Vasant Rao. But unfortunately, he gave in as well. This country needs a dictator. There already is one. I see a dictator in you. Look who's talking! You have never believed in democracy! There was a time when you uprooted rail tracks to protest against the government. But not a word against them after our arrest? What... What are you saying? I came to see you. The government says that Shiv Sena should try peaceful protests. Peaceful protests? And how on earth do we do that? In jail? Those who burnt the Bangalore Mail, Madras Mail, are considered national heroes. And we're fascists? Bloody sons of General Dire. Bloody sons of General Dire. George, some water? Yes, I am sure he's thirsty. I'll help myself. Here. Thanks to your democracy, 69 of my boys are dead. Saheb, some people are here to see you from the Chief Minister's office. -Should I send them in? -Yes. Bal, you must take care. Now everyone knows that George isn't the only one who can shut down Mumbai. When Bal Thackeray sets Mumbai ablaze... even Delhi... feels the heat! Sometimes one needs a spark to diminish the darkness. Some of Marmik's editions need to be delivered. I have asked Babban to do the same. -And-- -Thackeray, your letter. I'll be right back. -How are you, Kamble? -I am fine. For Mina. Long live Maharashtra. We have been receiving a lot of letters. Some are so emotional... that they touch our heart. And we feel overwhelmed. Such dedication and love! I received your letter as well. We have to be brave. The only thing I regret is that... no one is willing to defend Maharashtra in front of Delhi. A person like me, who has never walked a single mile... keeps pacing in the cell... all day. Thinking over and over again. How is our aquarium? And how is Marshall? Good to hear that Tibba and Binda are behaving properly. But be careful when you send them off far away for meetings. The police are heartless... and they won't hesitate to take actions... because they have no soul. Tell the children to read something nice in the afternoon. Bring them autobiographies of the great and successful. Shri visited me. I heard he's handling Marmik pretty well. He's been explained all the important factors. The family's responsibility is now on your shoulders... and I feel proud because I know you're fulfilling that responsibility... with utmost dedication. Take care of yourself. You didn't have the tea yet? Neelu... serve them some tea. Was that Saheb's letter? Yes. He's fine. The people love me. Is that my fault as well? Saheb, the people's love for you is making them resort to violence. Mumbai is under a curfew. Your men have closed down schools, colleges and factories. They are my boys. But, Saheb, this should stop. Mumbai has to return to normalcy. Saheb, it's a request. Only you can do this. Talk to the Chief Minister. The Prime Minister. They are the ones who have the power. Saheb, everyone knows who has the power. Now the law and order in Maharashtra, is in your hands. -And-- -And, sir... The CM has sent you a message... that other organizations are taking advantage of your agitation. The government has called in the Indian Army... to maintain the law and order in Mumbai. But I am very sad to hear this. The army is for the safety of our borders, not to deal with our internal conflicts. This is not good. The country is our first priority. Then, the state. Under section 146, assembling is prohibited. Citizens are requested not to loiter around or else they will be arrested immediately. I call upon my soldiers... to come together and work towards bringing peace and harmony back in the city. And... they must also make sure... that no other organization... takes undue advantage of our agitation and struggle. Bal Thackeray. There's a crowd gathered at Parel Naka. All of them are armed. Get there as soon as possible. The police have merely become an audience. Has the government turned meek? THE OPPOSITION. STATE ASSEMBLY, MLA KRISHNA DESAI. How much lower is the government going to stoop due to the fear of one man, Mr. Speaker? This is not democracy, this is dictatorship! Mr. Speaker, the government is forcing the police to bow down before the same man who sparked these riots. -Shame on this government! -Shame on this government! Mr. Speaker, they were wreaking havoc on the city while the ignorant government was snoring away. And we suspect that our Chief Minister was involved in it. So, I request you... In fact, I implore you to accept our no-confidence motion immediately. Krishna Desai, your time is up. Please sit down. Kalyan Rao is about to respond. -Accept our-- -Krishna Desai, sit down! Your time is up! It's been so long since we last came here. You hardly get the time. But I did today. Are you upset with me? I have no reason to be. Children eagerly wait for you to come back. And you? You already know the answer. Now, this is our life. Nothing is better than helping those in need. But the fact that all eyes are on us... is a bit weird. Get used to it. You know... earlier I used to see... the humor in people. But now when I look at them... I see their pain, their problems. It's almost as if the artist inside me is fading away. And along with that artist... my husband is fading away as well. -Mother! -Hey! -Mother! -Where are you going? Stop! Don't go that way! What happened, my dear? Don't cry. -My child. -You're with her, aren't you? -You should be looking after her. -Yes, sir. -Can she swim? -No. -Pintya, start the car. -Sir! -Hey, back off. -What are you doing? What do you want, son? Autograph, please. Whose? Hers? No, sir. Yours. -What is your name? -Keshav. That's my father's name as well! -Which school do you go to? -Gyaneshwar Vidya Mandir. -Which grade are you in? -Fourth. -Do you know my name? -Yes. What is it? -He looks more like a rat. -Exactly. THE ATTACK. NAGPUR AIRPORT - 1969. Why did Mr. Naidu need all of us to kill this rat? -What's his name? -Bal Thackeray. I have heard that he practically controls Mumbai. Really? Are you kidding me? -Mr. Naidu is here. -Let's go. Sir, some gangsters from Nagpur are here to kill you. They are outside. -Hand me my bag. -Saheb. -That's him, in there. -Come on. I am Naidu. Are you Bal Thackeray? Yes. So? We need to talk. We are talking, aren't we? Not here, outside. What's so bloody special outside? You scoundrel! Grab him. Move! Let's go! -Saheb, you're bleeding. -What? You threw trash at them, right? Some of the ketchup in it spilled on me. Let's clean it up. Bloody jerk! I feel ashamed of such youngsters. I don't want such soldiers in my party. I want fighters. But what about this attack? I don't understand such people. They live and breed here. But praise China and Russia. We'll have to get rid of these baboons. -Purna. -I'll be back in five minutes. Sit here. THE AMBUSH. 5 JUNE 1970. Where's that sack? Come on, let's go. Where is he? -Are there people around? -No. Purna, call him outside. Okay. -Mr. Desai? -He's inside. I've called for a meeting at gate number four. I want everyone to be there by 8:00. -And-- -Mr. Desai? We need to talk in private. It's urgent. Prakash, go see what he wants. No, sir, I need to talk to you. Go take a look. I want everyone there. Okay? All of you... It's raining pretty heavily today. See you, Comrade. Mr. Desai refused to meet us. But we need to see him. Please call him here. He wants me to talk to you. I will let him know. Close the gates. What the... -Tambe, bring me a torch. -Yes, sir. -What is it? -That's him. -Who are those men, Prakash? -Some people from Jai Bharat. Some people from Jai Bharat are here to see you. -Jai Bharat? -Yes. -Which party is this? -I don't know. Yes? -Sir, we're from Lalbaug. -Lalbaug? The Jai Bharat at Lalbaug. There is no Jai Bharat in Lalbaug-- Let go of him! Let go! Let's go! LONG LIVE KRISHNA DESAI. -Hey, stop! -Hey! Where do you think you're going? Trying to be smart? Come on, hurry up! Move! Move! -I won't spare-- -Shut up! -On whose orders did you kill him? -I don't know! -On whose orders did you kill him? -I don't know! -Tell me! Who sent you there? -I don't know! THE VICTORY. STATE ASSEMBLY BY-ELECTION. 30 SEPTEMBER 1970. Digu here. Hello, Mr. Journalist. What's up? It's been a while since you last called. Well, you know that my journalism is incomplete without you. -Is he in? -Let me check. Sarojini Krishna Desai is at 29,913 votes and Vaman Mahadik is at 31,592 votes. Congratulations, sir. Your candidate won. My candidate? Well, I'll have to call him your candidate. "Vasant Sena's" candidate! You're playing fine politics. Instead of expanding the Congress party... you're encouraging others. I hope this plan doesn't backfire. We'll deal with it if it does. Vaman Mahadik from Shiv Sena has won by 1679 votes. Saheb, the first candidate won. Congratulations. -May I come in? -Come in, Dada Kondke. So... I heard that Songadiya is a huge success. You can talk. They're family. -Sir, Songadiya was a huge success. -What do you mean? I requested the theater authorities to let it run for a couple of more weeks. -And? -They said they won't do it. They don't want to run Marathi films anymore. Why? They want to run a Hindi film. Tere Mere Sapne. I went to all the ministers. But no one could help me. Everyone is crazy about Hindi films. But they don't care about Marathi films. They refused to run a Marathi film! Do they expect Maharashtrians to watch South Indian films? Please do something, Saheb. -Long live... -Vaman Rao Mahadik! -Long live... -Vaman Rao Mahadik! Welcome! -Long live... -Vaman Rao Mahadik! I need your blessings, Saheb. -Saheb, this is all because of you. -Congratulations. Now, enough with the felicitations. Let's go to the Kohinoor theater. Kohinoor? What for? To put on a show. It was a Maharashtrian who started the film industry in this country. And now Marathi films don't get a slot in the theaters. -Long live... -Shiv Sena! -Long live... -Shiv Sena! In this city, you can't crush our dreams to live yours. It cannot continue. Here, the dreams of a Maharashtrian take priority. It's our dreams... before yours. THE LOYALIST. AIR INDIA - OCTOBER 1972. -Marathi workers deserve jobs first! -They do! They do! -Marathis have the first right! -Then the immigrants! -Marathis have the first right! -Then the immigrants! -Marathi workers deserve jobs first! -They do! They do! -Marathi workers deserve jobs first! -They do! They do! -Mr. Nanda... -Shut down your business! -Babban. -Long live... Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Marathi workers deserve jobs first! -They do! They do! -Long live... -Shiv Sena! -Long live... -Shiv Sena! MARATHIS DESERVE FIRST PREFERENCE! FIRST PREFERENCE TO THE LOCALS, NOT THE IMMIGRANTS. -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! Mr. Nanda... Maharashtrians have a primary right to these jobs. But I must follow the rules. Mr. Nanda, maybe the skies your airplanes soar through belong to you but the streets belong to me. Are you threatening me? What you're asking for, is impossible. -How are you Babban? -Long live Maharashtra. Got bailed out, didn't you? -Happy Diwali. -Same to you. Saheb, the moment you called up the authorities, I was set free. Happy Diwali. -Do eat before you leave. -Yeah. -Is your mother keeping well? -Yes. -Let it be. -What are you doing? -Let's go. -Take this. Why did you have to keep it in your pocket? Hello, Babban. How are you? -Happy Diwali. -Happy Diwali. -Come on. -Father, I want firecrackers. -Yes, I'll buy you some. -No, I want them now. -Let's first get out of here. -No, I want them now. Father! Shiv Sena, my foot! When you were rotting behind bars... there was nobody to bail you out. We have nothing to eat. Are we supposed to survive on his speeches? Go on, say it. "Long live Maharashtra!" Long live Maharashtra! Shut up! Like father, like son. If I ever hear "Long live Maharashtra," again... I won't spare you! -Long live Maharashtra. -Who is that? Hello, Aunt. Mr. Navalkar! Pardon me. -Please come in. -Is Babban home? Of course! He doesn't exactly go to work. He's home. -Mr. Navalkar! -Hey, don't do that. -Would you like some tea? -No, thanks. -Here you go. -What's this? Mr. Thackeray has sent this for you. -But, sir... -Keep it. -Money! Sir, I... -It's okay. -I'll get you some water. -Okay. How are you, Aunt? Sir, why are you giving him your money? Mr. Thackeray sent the money. It's not mine. Can you do me a favor? Tell him to stay away from Bala Saheb. In fact, you should stop working for him as well. Find another job. It's not good to be behind bars over and over again. -Aunt, was Babban arrested for theft? -No. Our agitation was to ensure that our people get jobs. One day your grandson will become a successful man. Just wait and watch. -Really? -Of course! Just have a little faith in Bala Saheb. -Sir, water. -Let it be. I'll take your leave. -Meet me at the branch office tomorrow. -Yes, sir. -Go on. -Yes. I don't want a godly status. I just want to work for my people. It's been 25 years since our independence. But the battle for survival is still on. And there is only one reason for that. Our youth doesn't have jobs. If the government can't, then we must do something for them. Instead of protesting, we must create jobs for them. We should start Vada Pav joints. It will become a source of income for the youngsters as well as provide an affordable meal to the poor population. Vada Pav will become Mumbai's identity. JAI MAHARASHTRA VADA PAV CENTER. Politics is a dirty business. Our organization... will dedicate 20% of the administration towards politics. Rest 80% will be dedicated towards social causes. There are huge hospitals for the rich... but the poor man dies on his way to the hospital. Start a free ambulance service. We'll set an example for all the political parties in the country. Don't just rant about not having jobs. If we want those jobs, we need talented candidates. We need to hone their skills. That's when we'll bear the fruits of our struggle. Prepare our boys for competitive exams. And... give them technical education. The owners survive only when a company runs smoothly. And if the owners survive, so will the workers. The country will thrive if the working class thrives. A strike will do more harm to the workers and their families. Start a union in all the big companies in Mumbai. GLOBE ENGINEERING WORKS UNIT. CHAIRMAN: DUTTA SALVI. The other parties have forced our kids on to the street... and ruined their lives. But our party will support them. If our boys don't get jobs right now... anarchy will spread throughout the country. Ladies and gentlemen, for the security of our country... THE EMERGENCY. 25 JUNE - 1975. ...the President has declared a state of emergency in the country. There is no need to panic. Hello, Gurwinder. Tell your men to burn all our posters. Inform all the party workers to reach Nagpur. Good luck. We have to go underground. Also, burn all the pamphlets. Listen, the police raided the Malda office. Hide all the important documents you have. Bala Saheb! Here you are trying to get your teeth cleaned whereas Rajni is trying to wipe out your organization. One can't clean with dirty hands. What kind of an emergency is this? Mr. Desai, it is a conspiracy to suppress our voice. Mr. Dutta... only Dr. Shroff can shut my mouth. Even though I have my hand in the tiger's mouth I can't suppress his voice. Otherwise, my clinic will shut down. Bala Saheb, don't take it so casually. This is their final warning. Shiv Sena must join hands with Congress. All the formalities have been taken care of. Someone from Rajni's office will bring you all the documents. If you don't sign... they will ban Shiv Sena. By now, all the documents related to it... have already reached Indira in the South Block. Tell Rajni I won't sign the merger papers. The day he puts a ban on my organization, will be his last. Hello. This is All India Radio, Mumbai. And now for the news. Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi will arrive at Mumbai Airport at 10:30 a.m. At 11:00 a.m., Tilak Bhawan, Dadar, Congress-- Why did you turn it off? What's wrong? Does Indira Gandhi read Marmik? Why? I mean... he's made a lot of caricatures about her. By the way, why do you think she wants to meet him? Maybe she wants to see a real tiger. Oh, God. You both are the same. Are they really going to ban our organization? Hello. I couldn't recognize Mr. Thackeray. -Hello, sir. -Long live Maharashtra. -Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. -Sir. -Welcome, Bala Saheb. -How are you? -I am good. -Are you sure? -Yes. Just a minute. Hello, Bala Saheb. I had a word with Vasant Rao. And he had a word with Madam. You arrived at the right time. Otherwise, the committee meeting would've begun. Madam has set aside five minutes for you. Bala Saheb, Rajni Patel. It will take a couple of more hours. Mr. Thackeray, Madam has called you inside. Don't be upset. I've heard you preach that Maharashtra is only for Maharashtrians. I believe in the unity and diversity of this country. Then why do people fear you? It's because of the media. I talk only about the rights and honor of my people. Rights? What rights are you talking about? I didn't create different states and languages. The constitution did. And if that is the foundation of this state... then our people have the right to live respectfully. However, that never happened. Then I-- Don't send anyone in until this meeting is over. Please continue. I never made any speeches against the nation. If you find any of my speeches, writings or cartoons promoting that Maharashtra is only for Maharashtrians then I will personally shut down my organization. Those who have been living for many years in Maharashtra are Maharashtrians to me. Like those living in Punjab are Punjabis... and those living in Bengal are Bengalis. If that is one's place of birth... then he should get the first preference to a job or education in his state. That's all. Whenever I say, "Long live India, Long live Maharashtra." I always say, "Long live India" first. And then "Long live Maharashtra." Because my country is my first priority. Then, the state. -Wait here. -Okay. Let's go sit there. What do you think about the emergency? If the emergency brings discipline in the country then I am not against it. My people were completely misinformed about you. That's why we also had some misunderstandings. Well, never mind. But do think about my proposal. But, thank you. Long live India. Long live India. Long live Maharashtra. Bring that file from Mr. Rajni. Yes, here you go. Out of all the organizations we have banned, I am removing Shiv Sena from the list. Prepare a new list. THE INITIATIVE. SHIV SENA HEADQUARTERS - 13 JUNE 1977. -Long Live... -Shiv Sena! SHIV SENA HEADQUARTERS. -Long Live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! -Long Live... -Bala Saheb Thackeray! Today is a new beginning for our people. People from every caste and community will be welcomed here. I will always be there for you. THE DEFEAT. LOK SABHA ELECTIONS - 1977. I would like to recite a few lines written by the great poet Mr. Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. Storms rage And so do cyclones... When the people raise their voice Listen to the clock ticking The times are changing Let go of your throne, Because the people are coming Let go of your throne, Because the people are coming This is a revolution, my friends. A revolution! Bala Saheb, Janata Party won only because of the emergency. Congress will never cease to exist. It's easy to stay in the opposition and give speeches. But running the government... That's enough, please. -The mutton is from Mumbai... -Have some more. ...not Baramati. Some more? But winning and running the government are two completely different things. In five years, people will say that Congress was better. Bala Saheb, we should do something together. Sharad, we failed in everything we did together. We started a weekly magazine, which failed as well. I never got to publish the second edition. I think we're better off as friends, not as partners. That's how you befriended Vasant Rao. No! Vasant Rao and I... We only share a cigar, not pull each other's legs. That's why we are friends. Here, have some rice. That's enough. I am full. Give him some more. He will need some to cook up a political story. I've always dreamed of a Maharashtrian leader... becoming the Prime Minister of this country. But the problem with Maharashtrians... is that Maharashtra is their only priority. -Bala Saheb, Maharashtrian leaders-- -Join us. -No. -Come on, sit. You know, Maharashtrian leaders... always sit beside each other when they go to Delhi. Why? To acquire each other's seat. Sharad, do you always think about politics? -Do you watch plays or films? -Sometimes. Did you watch the cricket match two days ago? Cricket doesn't interest me, Bala Saheb. But he loves cricket. If there's a match going on, he will not put down the transistor all day. I am sure he likes cricket. When Sharad says... he's not interested in something it means that he's very interested. Are you interested in me? It's five o'clock. Let's hear the radio. Let's hear what Morarji has to say in today's meeting. For the first time the population of this country... has chosen to stop being slaves to the Congress... and build their own government. -Long live... -Morarji! When the country was against the emergency a few... local parties supported it. It's time... that we get rid of all the other local parties in the country. Isn't this the Shiv Sena headquarters? Yes, they are the ones who supported the emergency. -Bloody traitors! -How dare you call us traitors! I am not scared of such baseless attacks. My father gave me a mantra. "Get up, oh Maratha, wake up." Normally a Maratha doesn't get instigated easily. But once he does, there is no stopping him. Even if they break a few pillars, the house won't come crashing down. My intentions and my thoughts, won't diminish so easily. The war is far from over, this is just the beginning. And it won't end until every Maharashtrian gets the respect he deserves. I am not scared of the darkness. Because I know that tomorrow, the dawn will paint the horizon saffron again. Saheb, Mr. Gupte is here to see you. Shall I send him in? Send him in. Long live Maharashtra, Saheb. Speak up, Mayor. Sir... Please don't hesitate. Speak up. The populace of the country... and the state have decided. They have chosen the Janata Party. -So? -Saheb, Shiv Sena's time is almost over. I mean, we did fight the battle. But this time, people have distanced themselves from you... I mean, from us. So, a majority of us believe that... from a political point of view... we should join hands with the Janata Party. Hey! Wait. And anyway, your party members are getting more violent. How can anyone expect political civility from them? My organization was always meant for such fearless people. It's because of them... that you became the mayor of this city. -Saheb-- -Don't you forget that. You're a doctor. Even you have knives. But you use them to earn a living and they use it to ensure that others get a square meal. That's the difference! And one more thing. Those who want to quit Shiv Sena can happily do so. I don't care if I'll be the only one left. Goddess Jagdamba has blessed me with enough strength to bring thousands of people together on my own. Saheb... You think the members of my party are violent, right? I will take this organization to new heights with their help. THE ALLIANCE? DEONAR. What is the problem in saying "Long live Maharashtra"? Let's forget about casteism and help each other. I am not against any religion or community. I believe in a man's deeds, not his religion. But I have observed... that whenever India loses a match, some people celebrate that defeat. They feel happy about it. We should put an end to that. If we stay together then those who make us fight in the name of religion, will soon have to quit this country. Whenever you celebrate Eid, we'll celebrate with you. But you must also celebrate Shiv Jayanti with equal enthusiasm and joy. THE BETRAYAL. BHIWANDI - 1984. -Jadhav, go that way. -Yes, sir. You... Sir, let's go upstairs. Get in! If they are going to stab us every time we embrace them... they are beyond help. No more Muslim leagues. If the Muslims of this country want to vote on the basis of religion, then... We shall stay loyal to our Hindu ideology. THE HINDUS. VILE PARLE ASSEMBLY - 1987. One should die rather than living like a coward. Are they so desperate for votes? They think about Muslims when they need votes. From now on, only those who care about Hindus will get to rule India. I... I had told Pramod Mahajan... if a Maharashtrian can cast his vote as a Maharashtrian then even Hindus can do the same in this country. And today... by electing Ramesh Prabhu, you've shown the power of the Hindus to the entire country. Even the court cannot stop us from promoting Hindu ideology. No matter what the decision of the court is... Shiv Sena will contest the elections on the basis of Hindu ideology. -Say it with pride... -We're Hindus! -Say it with pride... -We're Hindus! -Say it with pride... -We're Hindus! Your speech provoked the people. And your people demolished the Babri Masjid on your orders. Masjid? Which Masjid are you talking about? There used to be a Ram Mandir over there. Lord Rama's birthplace. How do you know that Lord Rama was born there? Was he born in Pakistan? Perhaps in Karachi or Lahore? There were no birth certificates back then. Otherwise I'd have shown it you and said... The people of India told me. Their faith told me. They believe that Lord Rama was born there. Mr. Lawyer, can you answer a question? What? Do you know where Babur was born? -I don't know. -You don't? I knew you didn't. Let me tell you. Babur was born in what is known as Uzbekistan now. So is Uzbekistan in Ayodhya? Look, I don't want to get into this. But people's emotions were attached to the structure your people demolished. No, we didn't demolish it. We simply cleared it. Hail Lord Rama! HAIL LORD RAMA. AYODHYA - 1992. Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! So, you think you didn't do anything wrong by demolishing the structure? I wasn't even there. And your accusations are leveled against my people. How can you expect me to stay quiet? It's just not possible. I live for my people. I can't leave them. I don't believe we did anything wrong. In fact, we broke what was an onslaught by a cruel regime. We simply corrected their mistake. THE INHUMAN. RADHABAI CHAWL - 1992. -Throw that away. -Yes, sir. Check over there. Go to the right. Bhalerao, check that side. Yes, sir. -Anybody there? -I am checking, sir. Shinde, anybody there? No, sir. Okay, let's go. Mother! -Stay back! -Saheb... -Saheb! -Move back! We've been waiting since morning, Saheb. -I just need two minutes. -Step back. -Saheb! -Mother! -Saheb... -Please stay back! -I said move! -Wait! Saheb... Yes, sir. I've been waiting here for three hours, sir. Just give me a few minutes. Send them in. Where do you stay? Behrampada, sir. My name is Amina. He's my husband, Taahir. And these are my children. They burnt down our house. And we have nowhere to go. Please save us, Saheb. Only you can save us. Why are you constantly looking at your watch? Sir, namaz... Well, sir... It's time for namaz. So... -You can pray here. -No, sir-- No, I have no enmity against your religion. My enmity is against those cowards who resort to violence in the name of religion. Do you have a mat for praying? No, sir. We have nothing. The fire destroyed everything. -Ravi. -Yes, sir. -Give them a mat. -Yes. -What's your name, dear? -My name is Asiya. And not just the demolition of the mosque, but even in Bombay-- It's Mumbai. -Yes, Bombay-- -Mumbai! You also had a hand in the riots that broke out in Mumbai. No, I had a foot. What? I personally went to meet the victims of the riots. Even after committing numerous murders, the culprits were walking free. They had to be brought under control. -But that's the police's job. -Exactly! But they are government servants. They won't act until they get orders. And the ones responsible to give those orders do nothing. Because their politics thrives on such riots. If the police are given the liberty to do their job it won't take them more than half an hour to stop such riots. But your politics also thrives on such riots. No, it doesn't. But when it is about my country, I don't play political games. However, you involve politics in games. Sir, please tell us about your BCCI meeting. Please, sir. Tell us. -Move! -Just a minute. Sir... Yes? Please tell him that Dilip Vengsarkar and Javed Miandad are here. We have an appointment. Dilip Vengsarkar and Javed Miandad are here. Who? Dilip Vengsarkar and Javed Miandad are here. What do we do? Wait. Let me ask. Send them in. Okay. Sir, Javed was in the city for a TV program. -And he wished to meet you. -Okay. -Go ahead. -So I brought him along. Try the fritters. You will never taste anything like this back home. Sir, I have heard a lot about your passion for cricket. I had a wish... I mean, I had a request... if we could resume playing cricket with India again. What's this, Colonel? What is he saying? Sir, without your permission, they... Sir... I think that if both countries start playing cricket matches again -the circumstances might get better. -Would you like a beer? No. I still remember your shot. You played really well. What was on your mind during that shot? Nothing in particular, sir. It was a do or die situation, so I just took that shot. To be honest, sir... that was the only bad ball delivered by Chetan Sharma in the entire match. Otherwise, according to his bowling analysis, he had played really well. But after they lost, everyone blamed him, -unfortunately... -That's how it is. We want to win every battle against Pakistan. Cricket is the only medium that can bring harmony between both the countries. What do you think? Sir... I think that you shouldn't put a stop to cricket. Please let both the countries play. It will be better for us. You are concerned about the game while... I am concerned about my country. One more thing. Your batting wasn't good enough to make me forget... the pain of those who lost a family member in war. Please have your tea. By the way, sir, even the government wants to talk to you about this. In order to play, one needs a ground, not the government. THE DOOMSDAY. 12 MARCH - 1993. Sir, a few days ago, we took four men in custody. We questioned them. And according to the information they gave us... Speak up. It was a conspiracy to murder you, Saheb. We were lucky to know in advance but we acted as soon as we got to know. Who were they? Miyan, the chicken is simply delicious. Get me some kebabs. Shinde. No, sir. No, sir! No, sir... No, please! Miyan... No, sir. -Sir... -Remember anything? Yes. Last year... we planned to kill Thackeray in a blast-- You! Thackeray Saheb. Thackeray... Thackeray... -Saheb. -Saheb. -Thackeray... -Thackeray... -Saheb. -Saheb. Continue. THE TERROR. PAKISTAN. We had planned to kill Bal Thackeray Saheb... but we failed. So, this time we planned to kill him during the rally on Dussehra. I live in Bartara. -Here. -I met Uncle Naeem over there. He introduced us to the mastermind. And then we started with the training. They explained the entire area to us. And the mastermind said that... if we do this, we shall attain salvation. -Is this case on record yet? -No. Make sure no one ever finds out about this. Otherwise, it will lead to riots. And it's our people who die in these riots. But, Saheb, you have to be careful. I mean, it will be better if you avoid going out for a few days. -Especially, out of Mumbai-- -Because of those terrorists? Elections are approaching. I have to conduct promotions and meetings all over Maharashtra. And my soldiers are capable of protecting me. Anyone who tries to wipe out my existence shall meet the same fate in this country, Officer. To all my Hindu brothers, sisters, and mothers! THE MAHARASHTRA TOUR. Long live... Bala Saheb Thackeray. I don't believe in democracy. MUMBAI. Democracy never existed in this country. PUNE. They question me whether I am Mumbai's Hitler. In fact, I am Maharashtra's Hitler. And someday I'll become this country's Hitler as well. If you can't maintain the law and order then I'll have to give guns to all my soldiers. SOLAPUR. KOLHAPUR. I don't mind if my soldiers are called goons but I don't want cowards. SANGLI. The Shiv Sena headquarters was attacked. I was attacked... and you want my soldiers to do nothing? I don't need to give them orders. The Hindus were enraged and the riots broke out. VOTE SHIV SENA. SAMBHAJI NAGAR. Which Aurangabad are you talking about? Why remember that tyrant Aurangzeb? If you want to remember somebody, remember Sambhaji Maharaj. No more Aurangabad. Henceforth, we'll call this land "Sambhaji Nagar." Why wait for my orders? VIDARBHA. It's my soldiers' responsibility that no one dares to misbehave with a woman. How dare they attack the police! THANE. If the police themselves feel unsafe how can they protect the common man? My message to those police officers is that you all are brave soldiers of Maharashtra. What are you scared of? If someone tries to harm you, gun them down. You have my support. SATARA. Don't mistake this for a stream, as it is an ocean. And this ocean is here to stay. The saffron flag of Shivaji Maharaj shall flutter in the skies of Maharashtra forever. And this is my promise to you. The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance has opened the doors for Shiv Sena to contest for the Prime Minister's post. For the first time in history, on 14th March 1995, at Shivaji Park, Dadar, Mr. Manohar Joshi from Shiv Sena will take an oath for the post of Chief Minister. THE UPRISE. SWEARING-IN CEREMONY. SHIVAJI PARK, 1995. I... I, Manohar Gajanan Joshi... swear in the name of God that I will... bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India. That I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. That I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties as a Chief Minister for the state of Maharashtra. That I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favor, affection or ill-will. I, Manohar Gajanan Joshi, swear in the name of God... that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person or persons... any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as a Minister for the state of Maharashtra except as may be required for the due discharge of my duties as such Minister. If loving this country is a crime, then I am a criminal. If caring for my people is a crime, then I am a criminal. The law is meant to protect the people and not the other way round. I was always made to stand in this witness box. And the people will decide if I am right or wrong, not you. Because only their verdict matters to me. I... gave structure to those spines that were shattered by capitalism. Is that my crime? The system punished freedom of speech and gagged this society. But I became the voice that challenged this system. If that is a crime, I am willing to do it again a thousand times over. Thanks to this system, it becomes necessary to resort to violence to put your point across. I was an artist. First, I used my brush as a weapon. But when it was incapable of giving justice to the people, just like our judicial system, I believed it was necessary to resort to all sorts of violence. For me, it was justified. And our history is full of such examples. And I don't care if they hang me to death for my crimes. Every crime I committed shall flow like an ideology through the blood of my people and Bal Keshav Thackeray shall thrive in every drop of that blood! LONG LIVE INDIA. LONG LIVE MAHARASHTRA.
