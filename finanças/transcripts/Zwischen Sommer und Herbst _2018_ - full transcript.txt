Let me tell you something. - Those two spanish girls over there liked it. - Uh-huh Lena, can you translate,please? No. - You speak Spanish? - Yeah. She also speaks English,French and Norwegian. Well, enough now. - Skipping one class in school wasn't enough. - It's enough. - I will go get us some drinks. okay? - Apple Juice. - Four languages, huh? - Yeah. But I don't speak all of them fluently. And why did you learn them? I just like languages. And I want to go to Argentina. - To study? - No, for internship. But I want to study aboard, if that work.

Come,give it to me. I like to lose control sometimes. I like it when you lose control. You are disgusting. Watch. Here,please. Ok. Okay and who pays for the rehab? She really can't drink much. Like she said. Does she have a boyfriend? No. I don't think so. There are not many guys who can handle her. - Smart as she is, with her special kind of humor. - Yeah,I already noticed that special humor. I'll do it. - Okay, I'll see you in a second. - See you. Okay, pants too? Hair clip. Sleep well. I suggest if the pedagogue doesn't work out, cooking! Thank you. - Headache? - Yes. I really don't know anybody who suffers for two days after drinking. Our little girl is growing up. How funny. Can we change the subject. Okay. Has the agency called about Argentina? They will call. Can we change the subject again, please? What do you want to talk about? Driver's license for example? Okay, let me rephrase it. Instead changing the subject can we change the person to be bullied? But it won't be as fun. - we can clear the table. -I thought you'd never ask. Kids, I can't see you work. I'll be outside if you're looking for me. Come on,let me do this. You have already cooked. - Okay - Alright, you do it. See you - No. Stay here. You're not going anywhere. - It was worth a try. Kids. I can't see you work. What? No. - Seriously? - Go on. Good, Good, Good. - Hey -Hi Thanks again for the dinner. - Very delicious. - You're welcome. I hang around here so much and then I can cook too. Don't worry, We are happy to have you here. That's nice. Can I? - You can have your own. - No, I quit smoking. I just want to hold. I think Jonas wouldn't like to see me smoking. They both are tough as nails. Who would have thought that these two would listen to me when I told them not to start smoking. But otherwise they are really nice. You can have much more worse roommates. - Where do you want to go? - Just come with me. Did dad give you his keys? No, I stole them. The fridge is already in the trunk. Come on, get in. - Good. - Good? Coupling? -Brake - Brake,in the middle, right? - Off we go. - Off... Okay. Yeah ? Shit. - Everything is great. - I'm trying it again. Oh! man, what is it. Shit, I can't do it. Right. You can't do it. Damn. Why couldn't you do it? Even much more dumbass than we are had made it. Who taught you to drive? A friend. My ex-boyfriend. - And he didn't even drive that good like you do now. - Pfff, for sure. Yeah. but he wasn't patient like me and just commanded. -Sound like a really nice guy. - As you can tell. - And why was he your boyfriend? - Good question. It's a long and boring story with me. I'm not good at being alone. Yeah, I think I know what you mean. But you always have Jonas and your father around. Sorry,that was stupid. Friends? Friends. -Key. -Hey. I will do it now. Okay. Concentrate. What now? - It doesn't work. - I assume that's not your fault. Why isn't working? Is the car broken? - Is the car broken? - You do everything right. - Are you kidding me? - A bit more accelerate. Gas pedal is on the right. No problem. Interesting. I like it here. - I need to clean up a bit. - Oh, okay. Do you need help? Yeah. Okay,what should I do? Here.Put these books in there. Alright. Thank you. You're welcome. And this one? Do you think itworks with Argentina? I hope so. Yeah, think positive. What do you have there? - Fancy - Yeah, right? Birthday present. For who? Myself. From me. It's your birthday? Today's your birthday? Yes. Jonas didn't tell me. Jonas doesn't know. Why? He would have bought me gifts, would have gone out. - These here too? - Yes. I don't get what wrong with that? I don't even like to be congratulated. That makes everything so serious. I don'teven like to be congratulated. Then "No happy birthday wishes" from me. Thank you. You are really odd. Odd? Come on. Odd is good. There is much worse than being odd. Nobody says odd. Yeah, me. - Something against it? - No. It is a great word. I like odd. Lena? Over Here. Wow. Cool tent. Jonas built it for me when I was 8 years old. My dad wasn't so happy that he punched the nails into the wood floor. It was our play area. Cool. - Can I? - Sure, Come. Wow. Your father gave me a key. And? I mean a front door key. I've never had a key from a stranger. Dad really likes you. And you are not a stranger. Where did you grow up? Nowhere. - Ah, so you didn't grow up at all. - Yeah, right. No, my mother and I just move a lot. And your father is... ...is somewhere in South Germany I think. No idea. I don't know him. - Oh, I'm sorry for that. - No,it's fine. If you know my mother, you would probably be on his side. She left behind quite a few broken relationships. Not much places left she can do. And do you still see each other? No, not really. The last time was at the funeral of my grandmother. Things between us are difficult. I don't even know these things, a cool tent. You have a good family. Jonas said that you can drive me to university with your scooter tomorrow? - Yeah, no problem' - Cool. Thank you. Eva will come around later. Hey... Hmmm? How are things between you and Eva? Do you want to hear about the birds and the bees. Or are we over this and you want to see dirty pictures? Forget it. - Morning. - Morning. What are you doing here? I have a date with Jonas. - He's not here. - What? He is at the University. Come on. Hey, where are you? I'm standing in your kitchen. Yeah, I know Lena just told me. No, you said I should come. I don't care about your study trip right now. We have a date. It's okay. I will do something else. It's fine. Bye. Your brother can really be a jerk. Could have told you that before. Lena, do you want to do something? Yeah, sure. Do what? Do you know what I always wanted to do? -You have to hold me. -Yeah, yeah,I will. Dad number 3 always wanted to teach me skateboarding. Before this happened he was no longer dad number 3. How many were them? I stopped counting or calling them dad. You have an eyelash there. Blow away and make a wish. Sorry,I shouldn't have. I'm sorry. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry again for today. I... - It's all right. How was your day? Good. What did you do? Was out with Lena. Hey, wait. Here. Thanks. Sweet of you. Hey, what are you thinking about? Some songs I just listened to. Apple? When do you know you love someone? Not just likes or adores, but loves? If you ever find an answer for that, let me know. I'm serious. Me too. It's not just an easy question. When did Jonas know he loves Eva? May be he doesn't know it yet. You didn't say like or adore, but love. At his age, I also had girlfriends that I like and adore. And then I met your mother. - I didn't want to... - It's fine. Your mother was the woman of my life and will be it forever. Besides you, of course. We didn't know in the beginning what we would mean to each other. We'd been just friend for so long and... ..then suddenly everything changed. I believe it's the little thing...like tying the shoes foe example. - Tying the shoes? - Yeah. You know that was never my strength. And one day your mother and I went out and she stopped to tie her shoes. And I saw that she took her time and was as bad as me with it. And I just thought. "Wow,the greatest and most beautiful woman I ever met." "But too stupid to tie her shoes" Yeah. Stuff like that. Shall I look for someone who has problems with shoelaces. Well, something like that. But searching is useless. When you find someone, you 'll know. In the small things in everyday moments. You coming? Yes. Eva, Jonas. Excellent. What are you celebrating? Lena's confirmation for Argentina. - So the agency finally called? - Wow! She got her language scholarship. - And it starts in two weeks. - Great. Two weeks, huh? Are you happy for me? Of course, this will be great. We already think about with your empty room. Miniature golf or a bowling alley? I'll go upstairs. I'll go get some glasses for you two. Do you any creative idea about what to do with the empty room. A big water bed maybe? - Hey, I'm just kidding. - - I don't think it's funny. You don't stay? No, I have something else to do. May I? Sure. That bad? Human relations can be very stressful sometimes. That's a way to say it. I don't know if these human relations are too complicated for me. Sometimes it's worth it then. Jonas is at his study trip until Friday. I know. I came to see you. Wait! What do you want from me? Are you really serious about this? I've been serious since the first time. Hey, are you okay? Yeah. I'm usually not like this. Like what? So nervous. Nervous? I'm making you nervous? Yeah. I don't think I've made someone nervous. Why am I making you nervous? You don't give up, do you? I think.... I have never been so close to anyone as I am with you right now. Is it bad? It feels good. Very good ever. But also very new. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I don't know what just happened here. It feels very beautiful. And completely wrong. What do you mean with wrong. I have to go. What? What suddenly make this feel wrong? What do I have to do here alone? What should I tell Jonas? What will you tell Jonas? Well,we have to talk to him somehow. No, we don't. Oh, I see. you're leaving and we're gonna pretend it never happened? I don't want to act like this never happened. But you will leave in tow weeks. And with Jonas ,I don't know. But what if this may have felt right for me? No idea. Hello, I'm back. Did you miss me? I've to go. Hey. Hey. Voila! That's your solution for everything since I was 3 years old. What else to do? It works. Where is Jonas? On the way. With Eva? I don't think so. She told him she has to study s lot for Universty and they can't see each other often. I screwed up, dad. That happens. But ask yourself how to handle that. Hey, you don't screw up alone. But now I'm alone with it. You have to talk to Jonas. I know. Combined tastes good. Hey. Hey. I can't imagine you being away for a long time. Listen. I have to talk to you. About Eva. There is someone else. What do you mean? I.. I met someone new. I betrayed Eva. You can come in without your reconciliation ice cream anyway. Are you okay? The conversation we had was different than I expected. I wanted to tell you earlier, really. - I would never hurt you on purpose. - I know. I don't think it is very funny. Come on. it's a bit funny at lease. Do you love her? Do you love her? I don't know. I know almost nothing about her actually. We argued. And then you came back and now she has to study for University. Oh. Oh. I was so afraid of what you would say. What should I say? What do you want? I don't know what I am for Eva. It scares me. And at the same time, it feels really nice to be near her. You know. Fear... Fear is absolutely okay. Can you stop being so nauseatingly understanding. What ice cream is it? Warm raspberry ice.. Sounds delicious. So. Here we go. I love you. Me too. Good. Hey, that come Jonas. Was he gone? He had somethings to do. Hey. Hey. What? I have so many things on my mind that I wanted to tell you, but.. I can't think of anything right now. That I'm an idiot? That I was completely out of line. I know. But maybe I can learn from it. It will be hard work. I didn't say it would be easy. You talked to Jonas. - Mmmm. - And? The conversation we had turned out to be unexpected. He said the same thing about our conversation. And now? I need to go to the airport. Can I drive you? I don't know. Please. Okay. - I just need to say goodbye. - Yeah. I 'll be waiting here. Here we are. I have to go through that. I don't want to let you go right now. And I don't know why I wanted to go in the first place. - Well,talking four different languages, study in foreign countries, remember? - Yeah, I remember. Come here. We will see each other in eight months? Okay. Okay. Okay. Two years Later Hey. It's me... Well... I just wanted to... Shit, it doesn't wok like this. Hey... It's me... Well... I just wanted to ... Shit, it doesn't work like this. Hey.. It's me... Well.. Hello. Hello. What are you doing here? I want to... You are not alone. No. I'm sorry. It's stupid of me to surprise you like this. I tried to call you. I better go. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Eva, wait. I was alone. - There was no one else in the apartment. I was just.. - I know. I know. You didn't expect at all. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. How did you find me? How did you get my number? From your father. I called him. And then you came here and... Why? Well, actually I want to ask you if you want to go to the beach together. What? I know it sounds absurd. You. You're standing in front of me after two years and want to go to the beach with me? Why? Uhmm...To talk. To talk? I don't hear from you for two years and now you want to talk? Why now? I was at the train station recently and there was this girl and... She looked like you. She was so excited. And... Then I dared to approach her and she turned around and it wasn't you. I mean... If my heart still beats so fast after two years when I think I 'm seeing you. What is that then? What does that mean? That's why I 'm here. To find out what it means? Do you think this is a good idea to take a trip together? No idea. No idea. I just know that it would make me very happy. Wow. I haven't been her for a long time. Who owns this? You uncle? Uh h. I didn't know you have an uncle. Well,he's an ex of my mother. We got along pretty well and he the only one I keep in touch with. It's really beautiful here. I wanted to show it to you. Do you want to grab a drink in the city? It's cold. But it's fresh air. But cold. But fresh air. Fine. What? Nothing.I just thought... What is it? This is our first date somehow. Do you have a cigarette. I didn't know you smoke. There are some things you don't know about me. I don't have a cigarette. But I can get one for you if you want. Can you go there? I couldn't understand what he wanted. And what did he want? That's Eric. He invited us to a beach party tomorrow. With campfire and music. I told him that you definitely come. No, you didn't. No, I didn't. I told him that we'd think about it . This one here works without words. I don't smoke. What? I just asked if you have a cigarette. You have a strange sense of humor. It is only for connoisseurs. I know. Why don't you leave. Do you want me to? No. I don't understand why you are here? And not somewhere else. I've been somewhere else already. Why are you staying when I behaved like I did. I want to stay here. When I returned from Argentina and you weren't at the airport. I was... ...relieved. I know you wouldn't show up. You hardly ever contacted me. But I hope for it. I was standing at the airport. And you weren't there. I was so angry. Not because you disappeared. Because you just did it. The way you always do. You kiss me. You....dump me. I let you kiss me. And I let you dump me. But I also relieved that you the decision away from me. Because I could be the hurt one. And now you are back. Should I not come? I was happy to see you. I don't know why I'm like this. Why this continues. I've hurt and abandoned so many people. There are many people I can't look in the eyes anymore. I don't want to be like this. But nevertheless, I do it again and again. With Jonas... It would have been the same with Jonas. I know that. Without you and your father. I saw what you have. Your father gave me a fucking front door key. And then you somehow have to be a part of it. And you... I don't know if... If it was you I liked... If it's really you or it's just because this was an easy way to destroy everything again. Like always And when I figured it out. I was so afraid that this would destroy everything again. But you didn't destroy anything. Why did you leave then? Because that's what I always good at. Leaving. But when I realized that I couldn't live with it, to never look you in the eyes again. It was too late already. But not that true. It just took me so long until I run out of excuses. And I'm sorry. An early warning would have been nice. Did I ruin the mood? - What mood? - Exactly. Shall we go outside? - Yeah? - Yeah.
