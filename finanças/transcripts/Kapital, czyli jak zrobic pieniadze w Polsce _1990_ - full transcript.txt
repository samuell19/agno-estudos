CAPITAL, OR HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN POLAND This is me, Piotr Nowosad. And this is my wife, Barbara and my son, Mateusz. I’ve just returned from the States after three years of lecturing at the Sociology Faculty at Madison University. After such a long absence I listen to all the news with interest. ...I even got involved. But I’ll tell about it at home. There’s no smoking in the taxi. I’m sorry. - Have you been abroad for long? - Nearly three years. - Then you’ll be astonished. - Why? -Do you know how much a dollar is? -No. I won’t tell you, so you won’t have a heart attack. Tomek’s father has started a business! - What business? - Tailoring services. But he knows nothing about it. He opened it with somebody, who knows all about it. See? People are creative. Apparently, nothing has changed, but is this still the same country I left behind? Only Safrotin... will protect you against... insects. Safrotin? I don’t know, maybe there’s something wrong with these cables. Decide today! I don’t know what it is. I really don’t. We have to call a technician. I can’t do it. Where do people like Grabowski get money from to start a business? - What Grabowski? - Tomek’s father. You heard what the taxi driver said. People are creative. That’s why we’ve set up APRR. - Come here... - What’s APRR? The Association for Protection against the Results of Reforms. Whom do you want to protect? Ordinary people; against smart arses like Grabowski. - Is it wrong to make money? - No, but not at our cost! Piotr, I don’t look well in this dress, do I? I wonder why I bought it. Let’s do it like that... Or you know what? Just take it off. Did you miss me? Did you? You don’t have to call anybody. I connected it myself! If I were you, I’d jump in at the deep end. Listen, Piotr, how much did you bring from America, if I may ask? Forty. You should get involved in something Immediately, and have an instant return. All right, but why don’t you start a business? Are you mad? On my wages at the theatre? Man, if I had some cash I would get into something straight away. Look! Vicor - computers. Alpha - zippers. Impako – coats for the Germans. - And you know that guy, don’t you? - No. You don’t? Professor Kasinski, a historian. A marriage agency for the past two years. A marriage agency? Why are you surprised? It’s money, too! He got rich from other people’s happiness. A historian! Sure, a historian. He got his degree in Luxembourgism or something like that, but decided that he can’t live on that, so he resigned, took a risk, and look now! Come, I’ll introduce you to him. Come on. This is unimaginable... Excuse me. Good day, Professor, I would like to introduce to you my friend, Piotr Nowosad. - Hello, Kasinski. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello. I mentioned you were a man of success. Success! Well, I’ve succeeded in this and that. Are you in business as well? Piotr just returned from the States. So, what are you waiting for? You see, I was away for three years. First, I have to, let’s say... get a smell of where things are at. The best smell is that of money. Of course, if you are not a masochist. I understood that only after I received my professorship. Don’t make the same mistake. Excuse me, I have an appointment. Hello darling, I’m sorry... Goodbye. Five years ago, there were only two houses here. Now it’s a whole district. We call it Beverly Hills. - Who do you think lives here? - I don’t know, doctors? Are you mad? Well, there is one, a gynaecologist. Film people? God, you’ve lost touch with life! - Who then? - Young wolves! Well, maybe not so young. In their forties. What do they do? What do they do? They make money! This one here has a boutique, that one a video company. The one over there makes towels, Rugs... things like that. Over there – computer games. - This one is into chicken. - Chicken? Why not? Thousands of chickens! He made money during martial law time. This looks like a bunker. It is a bunker. Stop here for a while. The guy lives in constant fear. He’s got the best alarm system in town. - Will you come with me? - All right. You’ll see how people live. - Wait a little, please. - OK. Well, not a bad place, huh? Stefan, when was it supposed to be? I’m sorry, I couldn’t yesterday, but I’ve arranged those labels for you, just as you wanted. - You can have as many as you like. - I can, but they must on time. Understood. Allow me to introduce to you my friend. Hello. - Piotr? - Czarek! - Hi! - Well, hello! Good to see you! A lovely place. Just a little shack. He’s a friend from student times. Only, I finished earlier. I was the smarter one, right? Well? A dash of whiskey? Stefan, please take this parcel to Helena because she’s waiting. Of course. And you, Piotr, must be a professor by now, huh? No, I’ve got my doctorate. Listen, do you have a factory here? Some small production. A little manufacture. It’s just a beginning. Sit down. What about you? Are you into something? No, I know nothing about business. I could write a book, but... This is not for me. You’d be surprised how easy it is. Well then, to our meeting! Czarek, Mr Sowinski is waiting. All right, darling, I’m coming. Excuse me, a client is waiting. Look, we have to meet again; you could tell me what’s going on at the University. And I’ll see you on Tuesday at Janek’s, right Stefan? Yes. - We’ll settle then. - That’s right. He was the worst student of the group. And look at him now. A manufacture! Does it matter? Let’s go or I’ll miss a fairy tale. Listen... "A flower shop for sale in the centre". What do you think? You like flowers, don’t you? And here’s something more interesting... "Partner with a large capital wanted. Anti-rust protection". - Where did you put my typescript? - What typescript? The typescript of the book I’m editing. I don’t know, it must be somewhere there, have a look. It was lying there. Here’s another one: "A photocopy shop". That’s interesting, clean work. Not too hard. I’d be dealing with literature. Computers are the best. How do you know that? Jacek’s dad regularly goes to Singapore and brings back computers. Jacek says that it’s the best business. Look, son, I didn’t come back after so many years, to go away again. Here is something very interesting. "Wellness studio". Many people get sick, one could make good money with that. Would you like to get rich with people’s stupidity? What do you want? I’m only reading. I’m telling you, Dad, Computers... That’s the best business. Listen, that’s great! A video rental shop. We could watch some interesting films, some porn... We could learn something. And make money by appealing to the lowest basic instincts? That’s disgusting! Oh God, I’m just considering various things. You smoke too much. What are you doing? There’s something to the fact that women achieve success so rarely. If Columbus had been a woman, he wouldn’t have discovered America. You couldn’t live in America. You don’t have a positive attitude to life. People in America believe in success. Even when their house is burning down. But they live in America! And for a burned down house they get more than they paid for it. Anyhow, don’t bother me, I’m doing my editing. I can’t look at it. You work like a slave. "I’ll go into partnership... I have the knowledge and own a car". That would be good for a beginning, wouldn’t it? What do I think of entrepreneurship? I’ll tell you a story I heard from a Japanese economist. Let’s imagine an island without mosquitoes, but with one hundred unemployed people. One day, the unemployed have an idea. They import mosquito larvae, which reproduce rapidly, and start producing mosquito nets, anti-mosquito creams and sprays, everything to do with combating mosquitoes. Of course, unemployment ceases to exist, the island’s trade turnover increases, but is the island really becoming a happier place? I think that this Eastern wisdom fits our economic situation quite well. All right, and now let’s talk about money. What are you interested in? That’s not important. You know the market, right? Look, you can manufacture anything. Whatever you’ll produce, there will never be enough. That doesn't need any explanations. Every child knows about it, right? The problem is to produce cheaply, sell quickly and make a good profit. Am I right? There is one more piece of advice - Don’t work too hard! And I'll tell you what not to produce: nails, pipes, grates, furniture and frames. Because wood, cement, and rubber are all scarce commodities. And even if the system changed tomorrow, there would always be difficulties anyway. Do I make myself clear? You want to make good business? That’s what I’m here for. Well, then listen. 20 km outside Warsaw there is a motel. This motel was built by a guy who inherited money from America. He built it, then he got sick and died. Now, the family wants to sell this motel. Would you go for it? In your advert you mentioned that you have a car. Yes, but what has that got to do with anything? Actually, why did you mention that? Well, Sir, I have various errands to run. I need a car for that. After all, you won’t be driving me around, right? Excuse me, I have to go. Thank you very much. Call me and we’ll see. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Why do you get involved with people you don’t know? They’re tricksters, they rip you off before you know it! Don't exaggerate. Nothing has happened yet. Take it and clean it once again nicely; make it shine. Hello! Hello, we are here. - Nowosad. - Ludwiczak. I’ll be back shortly. I’m glad that you’ve decided. - It will be chips, right? - Why, have you got a better idea? Janek does not only have good ideas, but good contacts to boot. And you don’t have to invest a fortune. My two acquaintances who started with chips and toasted sandwiches, now have big restaurants. I’m telling you, it works by itself. I can arrange for a chip fryer and potato deliveries. So? All right. I’ll take the risk. What risk? You’ll see, you’ll be very happy! - Bye! - See you. Let’s go. Success! Success! Success! Man, the chips are not fried enough! Go to your mummy, she’ll make you better ones. Mr Chip, what is that? - Do it at home... - What’s all that? - 570 zloty. - It’s starting already. The salt is there. 570 zloty. No, these chips are lousy. Look, son, just pay! Who’s got money? 570 zloty! Piotr, what have you done? What have you done?! Well, everything will have to be paid for. Maybe an appeal... or a hunger strike? Look, this is a very serious matter. We have to react sharply. We cannot just leave it be, this is the most important thing. They don't want to register our association. It looks like some kind of militant group not an association. Isn’t she going too far? One more step, and she'll call them to carry out a massacre. And she’ll probably start with me. Well, enough! I’ll go and calm them down. ...sprung some obscure stand, where they sell awful toasted sandwiches or chips. And why doesn’t somebody... Good evening. May I use the phone? Please, do. Good evening, is it Mr Bekiet? My name is Nowosad, I’m with Mr Ludwiczak. Yes. Yes, it’s about... about these cups. All right. A thousand to start with. Ok, thank you. Goodbye. Thanks a lot. Bye. Just a moment, where are they? These are videocassettes, here are frames for glasses. That’s Scotch. Cigarettes. Oh, here they are. A thousand? To start with. Maybe you need something else? Videocassettes? No, thanks. That’ll do for now. Excuse me. Yes? Well, what... what the hell do I pay you for? Please, switch the photocopier off. Not from the top, from the bottom! The button at the bottom! "Stop print". I’ll be there in two hours. Bye. Fuck, a fox killed all my minks. If you don’t look after your business, everything goes to shit. I’m surprised how you manage all of this. I don’t know. I think I’ll sell this photocopying business. Do you want to buy it? I have enough work with my own outlet. Pity. I’d sell it cheap. If you hear of somebody interested, let me know, all right? All right. Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye. - Five thousand. - Thank you. - I’m paying for the chips. - 220. Here we are. Thank you. - Here we are. Thank you. - Where shall I put it? - Is it trays? - Cups. Put them next to the potatoes. Here we are. 220. There we are. What are they doing there? The students. The potato peeler broke down. What are we going to do? Take a knife and help them peel. Me? Yes. Now, that’s too much. I am the co-owner here. And what about me? - There you are. - Thank you. Please. Looks like we have competition. With me here, they don’t stand a chance. We have cheap food here. And the bus stop. There you are. They have a bus stop as well. But further away. The time you waste standing here, that’s a kilo of chip already! Take a knife and help those kids. Can I help you? - Double chips for me. - Here you are. - Hi, Mateusz. - Hi. I got an A for my chips in cooking class! Congratulations. On Friday, we’re going to do toasted sandwiches. Try these! Fantastic. Well, try. Praise him, he made them himself. Hi. My God! - I’m thirsty. Can you make me some tea? - In a minute. - Did you do your homework? - No. Go on then. Try my chips! I’m fed up with chips. I’ve got some allergy. Look here, it’s gone all red. It’s a pimple. A pimple? Perhaps it’s an allergy? It’s a pimple. Put some cortisone cream on it. She definitely takes no notice of me. I’m nothing to her. You don't even care about my allergy. Lately, you don’t care about me at all. Excuse me for a moment. You don't even care how I'm doing! Well, you tell me every day! I know this is hard work. I’m really sorry. Yes? Hard work! Look at my hands! Listen, I’ll call you later. Bye, for now. Look at Mateusz, he can fry chips already! What are you talking about? He’ll end up in a food stall, following your excellent example! Barbara. Look at me. What do you want? I bring money home. For the time being you are spending it. Well, of course, I do! I’m talking to you, dear lady. Money has to be in circulation. Such are the rules of economy. See? Thank you very much, Sir. You are welcome. So, I don’t know if you understood my argument. It’s simply that all the economics of the film industry... I brought the forks and trays. What? Look at what those hot dog people are doing. They’ve priced their sausages only ten zloty more than our chips. So, what are we going to do? Dumping! We’ll lower our price by thirty zloty. - By thirty? - Sure. Our price is too high as it is. The law of the market. Take a piece of paper and write the new price. Where are the students? They’ve threatened me with a strike. So, I kicked them out. Now, we have to tighten our belt. Gosh! That’s the dean! I can’t let myself be disgraced! - Yes? - One portion, please. - How much? - Today 190. But, whatever you say... The dean is buying chips in my shop. See, people! I was right. Get on with peeling those potatoes! - Here we are. - Thanks. Since you are here, one day you’ll be able to get to know the “white whales”. They are the biggest. I don’t have access to them as yet. Go on, help yourself. There’s the food... And here is the alcohol. Mr Grzesiu, I arranged for this wallpaper, the one you wanted! - Thanks a lot - I’ll bring it tomorrow. He’s a lawyer, he’s got an interior decoration company. I help him a little. I’m independent! I have everything I need. This is Szymanski, our host. I gave to Solidarity... Why are you pulling me? Carry me, you yob! Hello, there. What cars have you got in stock? Why are you asking? They are too expensive for you! Well, for me – yes, but maybe my friend will buy something. Piotr has just started a catering business. Fast food. That’s a very good idea. Fast food wins in the market fast! I wish you every success. Well, I couldn’t say that you make chips. So, chips haven’t achieved a noble status yet? It’s money that ennobles you, not the goods. Do you hear, Piotr? Come on Piotr, I’ll introduce you to some people. Go on, I’ll stay here. Go. Excuse me. Allow me to introduce - Mr Piotr Nowosad, Mr Zbigniew Brun. Nowosad. Nowosad? Haven’t you written a book? Yes, that’s right, but it was more of a scientific paper. You see, I have a good memory for names. I saw it few years ago in a bookshop window. There was something to do with ‘life’ in the title, right? "This is a beautiful life". I was advising people on how to live. - Hi. - Hi. - Could you give me any advice? - Well, it’s no longer relevant. The book wasn’t successful. Only several copies were sold. Pity. Yes, but he is rather more successful in business. Piotr just started a small catering business. Oh, really? That’s great. Excuse me. They’re calling me. Look, you shouldn’t be so modest. Business does not like failures. Your book was a great hit. - But it’s not true. - And who knows that? You mustn’t be so passive, you have to be energetic! Be forceful, do you understand? Tell me, who is that man sitting there in an armchair? That’s Serafin. The oldest private business owner in Poland. Even the communist government couldn’t cope with him. Now, everybody comes to him for advice. He’s a guru. Me? Excuse me, I’ll go and see him. What am I doing here? I don’t fit in here at all. I think it’s time to leave. Excuse me, can you spare me a moment? Listen to me. I’m starting a very good new business. Bottle warmers for babies. I have everything ready, the equipment is waiting in Sweden. I need 15 million. - That’s a lot. - A lot? It’s only 15 million for two years with a return at inflation rate. Fully guaranteed. You want to borrow from me? I don’t have it! It’s too much for me. What’s 15 million to you? Forgive me, but it’s still a lot of money. Yes, but you gave Mietek 20 million for those disposable syringes. I’m sorry, that’s some misunderstanding. Misunderstanding?! And when you were screwing my wife, was it a misunderstanding as well?! Leave us alone, all right? Let’s go. What a madman! Don’t bother, there are many of them here. - Was she nice? - Who? - The wife. - Which one? - The one you screwed. No, it’s late. Let’s go. Well, I don’t know. You are making a mistake! You don’t leave a party like that too early! What’s happening there? I’ll break those chairs, take them! To hell with you! Take the Meissen china! Look, that’s the host! He’s drunk. Do you know why? The bailiffs are coming tomorrow. He’s gone bust. He’s owes the bank 40 million. Shit, and he was doing so well. Well, shall we go? No point in staying around here. But you said that one shouldn’t leave such a party so early! But I had no idea it was a funeral reception. Can I come with you? My dear guests, don’t go! Stay! Just a moment! No, I swear to God it’s not my fault. All right, we’ll see to it. Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. - What happened? - Don’t ask! Shit! I thought they’d kill me this morning. - Who? - The hot dog people! They complained to the police that we slashed their tyres. Who? Us? They did it themselves, so they can put the blame on us. That’s their method. They want to own the whole street. Fascists! - What are you doing?! - What, what?! They’ll come and beat us up! Let them! I’ll grab them and chuck them in the oil! I’ll make chips of them! Good morning. I’m from the Sanitary Inspection. We had a complaint yesterday that two people got poisoned here and had to have their stomachs pumped in the hospital. In our place? Mr Piotr, it’s impossible! We only sell chips. No. It’s quite correct. If I may, I’ll carry out an inspection. Go ahead! You’ll just waste your time. Waste my time? - And what is that? - Dust, isn’t it? Well, it’s a busy street. There is bound to be some dust. Not necessarily. Let’s see what else we’ll find. Looks like I won’t make any money here. Anyhow, it’s never been an El Dorado. Shall I say something about the chips? Pretend that this is your first business. Otherwise he’ll be offended that you didn’t come to him earlier. - Mr Nowosad? - No. It’s him. Mr Serafin is waiting. You only have two minutes, so please be specific. Please, follow me. Good day. I came to get your advice. I’ve returned from abroad; I have some money, and would like to invest it, but I don’t know how. What is the safest way nowadays? Dollars. Only dollars. It could also be gold. And you bury it. Bury it so they don’t see it. But I would like to start a business and I don’t know... Don’t trust the Reds! They’ll take it. They’ll search! They’ll lock you up! But I... Bury it, I said! Pretend, that nothing happened! Bury it! Take it far away! Far away! Bury it, I’m telling you! Thank you. You shouldn’t have upset the old man. Now, he won’t tell you anything. But I didn’t say anything to upset him! - Goodbye. - Goodbye! You must have worded the question oddly. No, the question was normal! I don’t know. I’ve never heard that he reacted like that. Strange. Thank you very much. I’ll see you on Thursday at five. All right. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you on Thursday. Thank you. Goodbye. What, Mateusz hasn't come back? No. Who is that handsome man? An operetta librettist? He’s a very talented writer. His first book is going to be published soon. Must be a romantic novel for love-hungry teenagers. Don’t worry. It won’t be in bookshops longer than ambitious books of not so ambitious authors. Oh, thank you very much. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you. But admit that instead of doing what you like and what you are good at, you are wasting your time and energy on some stupid chips. Maybe that will make you feel better - I’m giving up that business. No... That’s fantastic! But what are you going to do? Maybe I’ll go back to the university. So, you see? Frankly, you surprise me. I’m not saying it officially, but off the record, people have started leaving the university. I thought that you’ve also started some business. Don’t spread it around, but to my mind, talented people have nothing to do here. I’d gladly leave myself, if I could do something else. Actually, I was determined to come back, but if you say so... Don’t make any hasty decisions. By the way... It seems that you have some small capital, is that so? Kind of. I’m not asking out of curiosity, but if you were interested, there is a photocopying place for sale. Engineer Bekiet. - Do you mean the one in Zlota Street? - Yes. Do you know him? Yes, I do. That’s even better. If you push hard, he may go down on the price by 20 or 30%. So, are you interested? You know, I’d have to think it over. Well, I could get you some good orders. From the university. I understand. See you then. - Hi, son. - Hi. - Who’s with your mother? - The writer. What are you doing, programming? No. I’m balancing bank accounts. Is it an exercise? No, they are real ones. Guys give me money, I record it on the computer and pay them monthly dividends. - What are you paying them? - Profit on the turnover. How do you do that? For example, I buy books in bookshops and sell them on the black market. How much have you earned so far? At the moment, about 50,000. When the business expands, it will be more. How do I look in this situation? Am I to be inferior? Success! Success! Success! Hi. Hi. Can you spare me a moment? - How many copies? - One. - Do you want to earn big money? - And what am I doing now? - That’s just peanuts. I mean big money. - I’m sorry, I don’t have time. But I have an order for you, 15,000. 15,000 of what? Forms, for your friend, Czarek Putek. 15,000 for Czarek? Why so many? He moved into a new field, he now has a kind of information bank. - Will you take it? - Of course, I will. 50 zloty. - For when? - For Wednesday. I can’t manage it by then. At treble rate? - Treble? - I mean double. No, man, I can’t do it. I only have two photocopiers. All right, then half for Wednesday and the second half for Friday. - Okay? - Okay. - See you then. - See you. I’m sorry, we’re closed. We finished work for today. I told you, Gentlemen, not to put me in a no-win situation. I can't afford to find out at the last minute that there are 5,000 buttons missing! These coats are going to Vienna, and the buttons must be found! - What can I do for you? - I want to see Mr Putek. My husband is in the video studio at the end of the corridor. Thank you. Mr Zieba, you have to go to Lodz, today... Only “Idylla” will give you happiness! Somewhat provincial, don’t you think? Not at all! I like it, but if you want we can do a new version. OK, then. Hi, Piotr. Hello. I brought you those forms. Thank you. Meet my acquaintance. Hello. We’ve met already. - Indeed. At the “Green”? - No, at Intraco. Oh yes, I remember. How is it going? Piotr has a photocopying shop now. He’s doing very well. You should order some advertisement leaflets from Czarek. Great idea, I haven’t thought of that. Well, I’m off. I’ll call you about the new version. Give my regards to Ruda. I’ll be off as well. The day after tomorrow I’ll bring you the rest and we can settle then. Ok. And soon I’ll have a new order for you. Take care. Nice commercial, isn’t it? Smart guy that friend of yours. Luckily, he doesn’t compete with me. But I heard that you are doing quite well too. Thank you, I’m very satisfied. Just don’t operate only one company. Money attracts money. Invest into something straight away. - But I don’t know what to invest in. - Anything that brings in money. This is my company. Would you like to come in? - Gladly. - Please. I found the premises for Putek. Now he provides services to me. It starts getting busy in the afternoon. Here’s the toilet. Here boys meet girls for the first time. There is the catalogue. That’s my kingdom! Please, come in. You can choose a girl. Go on, have a look. Good, huh? Interesting. On this side I have boys. Over there is my office. All electronic equipment. Computers, videos... In contrast to others, I work in a modern, scientific way. That’s why I’m so successful. And do you know, why else? Because I respect people’s feelings and I’m not greedy. You know, I’m thinking of expanding, setting up a chain of such offices. But... where, in Warsaw? In Warsaw, in Poland. I could take you as a partner. - Me? - And why not? I already told you that you have to invest your income. - Good day, Sir. - Good day. Please, come in. Good day, please. Only don’t think about it for too long. If I were you, I’d go for it straight away. You won’t risk anything. You’ll be making money anyhow, only under his brand. Do you know how much money I would have to invest? You didn’t spend all the money on the photocopying place. Not all of it. How much do you intend to invest to start with? What do you think? How much should I put in? One point to you; you don’t reveal how much money you have. I can see that they taught you something in America. Well, a bit. That’s great. I’ll be honest with you. If, to start with, you put in, let’s say, 40 million - I’ll go into business with you. But be quick in deciding, because in a month it will be 70. That guy has been successful. He made money. If I’ll go with him, I may do quite well. All right. Excuse me, are you the owner of this outlet? Yes. Could I talk to you in private? By all means. Please. May I see your orders for the last months? - Are you aware of the regulations? - Yes. Do you check the identity of your customers? And what do you think? Am I a policeman? That’s a profession as well. Was that copied at your place? I don’t know. I don’t read all the material that I’m given to photocopy. I’m sorry, but you’ll have to close your outlet for a while, until we’ll clarify this matter. But I’ve only opened it two weeks ago! And I should close it already? That’s not my problem. I carry out orders from my superiors. You’ll get a letter to this effect. If you won’t conform, your licence will be withdrawn. Thank you for your cooperation. Goodbye. Excuse me... Didn’t you work for the Sanitary Inspection before? Me? No, never. I’m sorry, I must have made a mistake. The chip shop closed down because of one authority. Now, another one is closing the photocopying business. Fortunately, this time I protected myself. I have another company. Don’t worry about it too much. Sell that other business and concentrate on “Idylla”. Yes, I think I’ll do that. It turned out really nice. - I copied a lot from your office. - That’s very good. A company should have its own character, like the McDonald’s bars. Then it becomes recognisable. - Did you check the cassettes? - Yes. - The computer? - I’ve practised every day. - The light? - Here we are. Very good. This is our advantage. Professional attitude. - The music? - Got it. Well! Excellent. Tomorrow morning I’ll send you a secretary. She’s very good. Checked. Magazines? Yes. Over there. What? Playboy? Take it away immediately. We are interested in the soul. Let’s leave the body to amateurs. And if there are any inspections, official letters or complaints, please let me know. I’ll take care of it. - Right. - Good luck. Goodbye. Dad, do you have a business like Maciek's father? I don’t know what business Maciek’s father has. - A greenhouse. - No. Have you chosen something? Chicken. What kind of business do you have? Dad has a club for people in love. Does he earn more money than Maciek’s dad? Not yet. That’s not a good business. See, Dad? Piotr, old boy! That’s right, that’s a proper place for businesspeople. I’m very sorry, let me introduce myself. Putek Cezary. Nice to meet you. Maybe the lady first. Putek Cezary. Putek, pleased to meet you. Good, Piotr, good! That’s right! It’s nice to have a bit of money. Hi, Son. You have funny hair. See Piotr, it’s nice to have cash in your pocket. Only you have to be careful. - Czarek! - I’m coming, Baby, I’m coming. The wife has gone away for two days and done me in for 30 million. Such is life! But we aren’t finished yet. Will I also become such a bore? I wonder, what my father-in-law thinks of it? Should I comment on this in some way? But I won’t say anything. After all, it’s Piotr who is the main character in this film. Just keep it up, Piotr. I’m sorry, I won’t bother you. A beautiful woman. Well, what? A friend from my student days. Nice gadget. Listen, the chip shop wasn’t a good idea. By the way, do you know what Ludwiczak is doing now? He opened an art gallery. I wouldn’t have thought he knows anything about art. Well, does it matter? Do you know anything about matrimonial matters? - Forgive me, but there’s a difference. - None whatsoever! Luckily, you are in good hands now. Yes, actually I have a very good feeling about it. If everything goes right, I’ll pay Kasinski off and the firm will be mine. Well, see, that’s better than lecturing at the university, huh? Stop by the theatre, will you? Bloody rehearsals, they only waste my time. Call me next week. - Bye. - Bye. These are the applications that came today. Oh, nice! Sweden, England, Holland. Let me remind you that Mr Rosochaty is coming at three. Who is he? He’s a Pole from Munich, aged 57, owns a few motels. Right, where do I have his application? Here we are. Here. I wonder, where Kasinski found her. An ideal secretary! But too cold, too American. No, this one is too old. Maybe this one? No. You see, this one has some qualities. She’s an art historian. I need a wife not a scientist. Can you show me something else? All right, I have other cassettes. Gin, whisky, tonic? A drink? I didn’t expect that. Gin and tonic. Well, you see, Sir, Poland is also in Europe. Oh, this one! This one is good. Pause it on her. Thank you. What does she do? Let me check. She’s a nurse. So, you see? I can read faces. That’s the woman I’m looking for. I'll tell you something, but it's just between us. I'm not strong. I’m looking for a wife who can take care of me. And this one has the right profession. I understand, but... In Germany, nursing services cost a lot of money. Why should I throw away money if it can stay in the family? Yes, but the computer says that she’s been matched already. I don’t mind that. Yes, but they may be engaged by now. - I’ll pay you. - No, it’s not about the money. Don’t say that. It’s always about money. I’ll pay you well and she’ll live like in paradise. Do you run a private company? - Yes. - That means we’ll come to an agreement. Tomorrow at 4.00 at your place. Is this all right? Yes. All right. You know, it would be good to see on those cassettes how those women walk, talk... And it wouldn’t do any harm to see a bit more of the body. Yes, well you see, but... We are a marriage agency. Indeed, that’s why I came here. Tomorrow, at 4.00. Goodbye. Any problems? That German wants a client who’s been matched already. - So, what? - What do you mean “so what”? Just tell her who he is. I bet you she’ll change her mind. No, that’s unethical. Mister Piotr! I don’t think I got used to it as yet. For a businessman, I have too many scruples. Miss Ewa, please call the client and arrange with her to come tomorrow at 3.00. Okay. You look great today. Really? Do I look ok? Of course. Mr Piotr... - Hello. - Hello. Excuse me, can I have a word with you? Please, please sit down. I need to talk to you about a delicate matter. I have a new partner for you. But you already found me a partner. Yes, I know, but this is no longer viable. What do you mean? It’s my fault, or actually the computer’s. It happens sometimes. But... we got to like each other. Yes, I understand, but he has been assigned to somebody else. And I have a German for you. Actually, he is a Pole, but lives in Munich and owns several motels. When he saw you, he fell in love with you straight away. I’ll show him to you. - That one? - Yes. Do you like him? I don’t know... He’s not young. Yes, but in your application you wrote, that the man could be up to 60 years old. - Is he really from Germany? - Yes. And he owns those hotels? Motels. He’s a very rich man. I’m sure you’ll be happy with him. But you must decide quickly. He’ll be here any moment. Oh, my God! I came here unprepared. Don’t worry about that. We have a special room where you can get ready. Please, this way. Pity. I really got to like that other man. Please, don’t worry about it. I take it all upon myself. Miss Ewa, please help our client to freshen herself up. I didn’t think I would do so well. I’m learning! I told you it could be arranged. Well, yes, but I didn’t know it would be so easy. For a businessman, you have too many scruples. You are shy, aren’t you? Probably. But you’ll be surprised how quickly I learn. I invite you for dinner. We must celebrate this success. You know what? Let’s go to my place. I’ll prepare something nice. It will be nicer than in a restaurant. I have an idea. Photographing people at home. When they are clearing the dishes, in the kitchen, frying eggs... That’s a good idea. Don’t tell Kasinski about it because he’ll steal it from you. But we work together. For now. Probably one day you’ll become independent. Surely, you don’t intend to work for somebody else all your life? And I wouldn’t trust Kasinski too much. So far, he’s been loyal towards me. Must we always talk about work? No, of course not. Well, then come here. Come here. I have one more idea. To install a camera in the office. Have you ever cheated on your wife? No. Is your marriage happy? Yes, it is. Although lately... Something is going wrong lately. I don’t know why. I don’t understand. Pardon? How can you make business if you can’t even start with something simple? Be careful, put your hand here, zoom in on me and now go on... Hi. - Dad bought a video camera! - Oh, my God, what’s that? I see that you have more and more money. No, it’s for work. We are innovating. For what? First of all, you should bring innovations into your own life. What are you up to? What are you talking about? Give it to me! Here is a man who got his PhD and wrote a book. But what do you mean? I earn money honestly! Honestly! Do you want to do it all your life? Is this the peak of your possibilities? I can see that we no longer understand each other. I think we don’t suit each other. Stop it! Stop playing with this camera! Do I interfere with her work? Do I dissolve her association? What does she look like? She has neglected herself recently, became unattractive... She’s right. We don’t suit one another. Now, in my position, I should have a more representative wife. Who knows? Maybe we should... Hi. We have a guest. - Who? - From the Tax Office. After five months? It’s a routine inspection. No worries. - Are the papers in order? - Of course. Good day, you came to see me? Yes. Marian Dusza, from the Tax Office. Could you show me your books? Pardon? The books... of course. Please show the gentleman the books. Of course. Yes, it’s the same guy. I recognised him straight away. But this time I don’t give a damn. Kasinski will deal with him. Oh my God! - Do you do any sport? - No. You should play tennis. Tennis? Yeah. Everybody plays it, even Kasinski. - I could arrange courts for you. - All right. Providing you’ll play with me. I’m too good for you. You can hire a coach. - No, there’s no point in it. - Why? You meet people on a court, exchange information. It’s useful. All right. You should also take up surfing. Surfing? Can Kasinski do that already? Since we’re talking about Kasinski, I forgot to tell you that the inspector found something. Why didn’t you tell me earlier? There was no time. - But what did he find? - I don’t know. He said that they’d send a letter and everything will be clear. - But what do they want? - Relax. Let’s finish. Thank you. Very good. You are making progress. But remember, more to the side, legs bent and don’t change the grip. Very good. I’ll see you on Friday. Good day! Maybe it is good, but not for you. What happened? Ewa call me a half an hour ago. A letter from the Tax Office arrived. I don’t know anything about it. Because you play tennis instead of looking after the business. You play it as well. Yes, but I don’t make mistakes like you do. - What do you mean? - I don’t hide my income. I thought I can rely on you in these matters. Are you saying that I’m a thief? What is this about? It’s about that German. You sold the same woman’s offer twice, and you recorded it once in the books. Then you did the same with her first fiancé. And you took the same money from him twice! Have you gone mad? You can do that, but you must include an annotation in the books about a double contract. Well, all right. Even if I made a mistake, it only happened because I lack experience. Can’t you use your head? After all, you’re a doctor. Yes, but in sociology and not accountancy! You know, I'll try to cover this whole thing up, - but I’m closing your business. - How come? I cannot let this scandal affect my company. I need a new man and a new name. We’ll agree on the details later on. What happened? What happened? It’s me who should be asking that! Why do I have to find out about the letter from the Tax Office from Kasinski? Because you were not here. But that’s no reason to tell Kasinski first! Kasinski is the co-owner of the company. Besides, he knows what to do in such situations. Why were both payments not recorded in the books? - It was your responsibility! - Just as much as yours! Surely, there is a division of duties! And you were responsible for that! Please, come in. I’ll be ready in a minute. I can’t talk to you now, I’m going out. Does that mean that from today I have to address you as “Miss"? As you wish. It doesn’t matter any longer. I recommend her to you. As a professional she’s...! You look great today. I think you’re too emotional about it. - I’m losing my company! - I’m talking about the secretary. As for the company, you can’t do anything about it. You’ve signed a bad contract with Kasinski. - Have you seen Mr Jozek? - The boss is in the office. I’ve put a lot of money into it, he can’t just simply take it away from me! I’m afraid, he can, and if not, you’ll have to deal with the Tax Office and the prosecutor. Unfortunately, this flower has thorns. Wait for me, I just get some money. Is that all yours? No, not really. I’m just a shareholder. I get a few pennies out of it. They pay me dividends. The guys are selling it for dollars. Well! Niki Lauda. Wait for me here. No, that’s the end! I’m going to finish with it. I’ve had enough! I’m fed up with it! I can’t stand it any longer! What happened? What are you doing? Nothing happened. There is no newspaper, no association. But nothing has happened! We’ve simply parted. Everybody decided to make money. Just like you. No! I’ve stopped making money! I’ve finished with it. I’m fed up with making money. I’ll go away somewhere. I have an idea for a new book. - I don’t believe you. - No, really. I’m going back to my profession. That’s what you wanted, right? Yes, but we've grown too far apart. Don’t you think so? - But that’s my fault. - No, the fault is mine. I became an activist for no reason whatsoever. Nobody is interested in it. I stopped caring for myself, I look... You look great, really! Don’t be a hypocrite, Piotr, I can see it. But it’s a good idea. You go away and rest and I’ll get myself in order. So, what will the book be about? A new version of "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". About the duality of human nature. I even know who the main character will be. At last. Complete freedom, I don’t have to do anything. Fresh air, plenty of space, mountains. I was lucky. I didn’t meet any acquaintances. Here I am! Thank you. I’m lucky that I met you. That will be a nice keepsake. Are you staying here long? It depends on how my work goes. I still have something to write. And we are leaving tomorrow. - Have you eaten yet? - No. Get dressed quickly. We're going to the “Kasprowy”. - No, thank you... - Well, come on. I’m inviting you to a farewell dinner. We’ll have a good time! I remember now. I’ve been to your party. I think it was a farewell party. Well, not really. Get dressed quickly. I’m waiting in the car. - One more Coke for the lady. - Very well. I didn’t even know that you were there. I hope I didn’t harm you. Thank you. Luckily, I was standing quite far away. I hit somebody with a chair, I don’t remember whom. I got out of it somehow. I found somebody who lent me money and that solved my problem. And what, they didn't auction you off? They did, but it was my second bankruptcy. This time I was prepared. See, once you start making big money you don’t drown so easily. To your health! What am I to do? I fell in love. I’m wrapping up the business for her and we are going to see the world. Have you set up any new businesses since then? Well, I can tell you the truth now. I had this business before, but under my cousin’s name. When it started bringing in real money, I signed it over to myself. What business is that? Frogs. Pardon? Frogs. A frog farm. Great business. I sell them to the French, Germans, Austrians... They breed incredibly fast, and you only work six months because they sleep in the winter. I’m telling you, great business! But I’m quitting it. Ania and I are going to Paris to start with, and then further on. I've worked very hard and I deserve a bit of life, right? Of course. And what do you intend to do, I mean... with the frogs? Sell them. She’ll look great in Bermuda, won’t she? - Oh, yeah. - Great. You said you weren't going to get into any business anymore! And now you just went away and you've got a new idea! You’ll lose the money that you earned in the States! Firstly, I won't lose it, because it's a secure business, and secondly, I’ve earned this money and I will spend it! What are you talking about? You earned that money, but remember that I was alone with the baby at that time! You're going to throw it all down the drain! I told you, it's a good business this time. This business looks as good as you in this suit! If you haven't made a fortune so far, you never will! This game is for young people. We’ll see if it’s just for youngsters! - Well, gentlemen, good catch? - Yeah, great! Well, you see... I employ 50 people, mainly from local villages. They work in two shifts. But if you don’t like frogs, you don’t need to have anything to do with them. You just have to look after the money. Now, I’ll show you the production. It’s like that of a car factory. The frogs are taken from the pond, and the women pack them into special foil bags. Over there is a machine that blows a bit of oxygen into the bags, so the frogs won’t suffocate. Then they are packed into boxes, sealed, and loaded onto a lorry. Well, let’s go to the office. Come on. Mr Mietek, here’s your new boss, Mr Nowosad. Please, sit down. Hello. Mr Mietek will arrange everything for you. He knows the place well and has good contacts. Please, take care of Mr Piotr. Gladly. I’m always available. Well, let’s talk about the money now. Have you noticed? Nowadays everybody talks about money. There’s only one difference - we know how to make it. Hi. Aren’t you sleeping yet? No. I’m doing the homework. What do they teach at this school? I can't cope with it. I’d have thought that shouldn't be a problem for you. Right, here’s a mistake! Listen! Where were you until now? It’s after midnight! Napieraj invited me for dinner to celebrate the publication of his book. That handsome guy from the operetta? Don’t be mean! I don’t want to see him again in our place! All right? Listen to me! I also live in this house and I can invite whoever I want! Besides, I stopped interfering in your affairs, so you don't get involved in mine! Anyway, you can move out. Good idea. Who the hell is it at this time?! - Good evening. - Good evening. - Mr Nowosad? - Yes. Are you the owner of the frog breeding farm in Marki? Yes, since very recent. We are from the League for Environmental Protection. This is our protest letter and demand to close the farm as soon as possible. I’m very sorry, but I don’t know what the League for Environmental Protection has to do with it! You are devastating a natural environment. Our previous protests were unsuccessful. But I’m warning you that, this time, we will go to court. That’s all. Excuse me, is your name Marian Dusza? Yes. Why? Then we’ve met before! I don’t remember. I’m seeing you for the first time. Now, it’s not nice to lie like that. You’re mistaking me with someone else. I am a social worker, a veteran, not a government official. Good night. Good night. Well, that’s the end. Every time that guy shows up, it’s the end for me. There is nothing to worry about. They have been protesting like this for a year now, and to no avail. Szymanski won't allow to be intimidated. - But they can sue us. - Then we’ll win. We have a good lawyer. - This is absurd. - Of course. Szymanski proposed to them, that each year he would release 500 males and females into the forest. And just imagine, they didn't agree to that either. They wouldn’t listen to any arguments. And this being the situation, Szymanski decided to ignore them. So, don’t worry about it. A representative of a German company is coming here next week. They want to sign a new contract. Great. Also, the French announced their arrival, but they haven't given a date yet. I see that you have everything under control. In that case, I can relax. - What are you doing here? - We’re picketing. Whom, me? By what right? We have permission. This is our form of ecological fight. Jesus Christ! I knew right away that you will bring me misfortune. Murderer! What am I to do with them? Pretend that it doesn’t concern you. But it does! Isn’t there a way to get rid of them? If they do it legally, then no. But don't worry. They’ll get fed up and go. But the neighbours will lynch me; this is a serious matter! It doesn’t matter. The French sent a telex. They are coming next month. Good. Thank you very much. And what else? Nothing, a telex came from the French. They are coming next month. - But what has that got to do with... - Exactly. There was also a telex from the Austrians. They want to order twice as much as last year. Tell me, why didn't Szymanski tell me anything about this League? Because it’s not important. - Did I tell you about the Swiss? - No, you didn’t. A Swiss company got in touch. To start with, they want 5,000 frogs. Why are you saying that it doesn’t matter? - Did they picket Szymanski? - It’s their new form of protest. But why must I always be the victim? It’s been going for two weeks now, the neighbours stopped talking to me! Just endure it a bit longer. They’ll get fed up with it. It can’t last forever. However long it lasts, it’s lasting too long! Goodbye, see you tomorrow. Basia, they’re not here! Not here! They’re gone! What’s going on? They’ve left! Look! They gave up! You were right. Very right. They are demagogues. Frogs first, then the government. Morons! Hello? - Good day Mr Mietek. - Good day. They’ve given up. They’re not here. - Excellent! - Yes. They gave up! Right. Have we got any orders? Don’t be so pleased. We received a court summons. There will be a trial. Thank you, all right. Hello? Hello? What are Szymanski and Ania doing now? Where are they? In Monte Carlo? In Bermuda? Or maybe in Pernambuco? Mr Karol, I have a favour to ask of you. Please go to Chelmska 12 and pick up some parcel for Lodz. All right? Okay. You know what the judge said? That her sense of aesthetics doesn’t permit the thought of eating frogs. That’s why I lost. Why did you get involved? You should’ve checked what kind of guy he was and why he was selling. - Hello. - Hello. Why so much? I had to take a different route. The bridge is being repaired. - All right, but I’ll check it. - Very well. Please come tomorrow. There is a consignment for Lodz. All right? What is it actually? - Didn’t Putek tell you? - No. We’ve set up a transport company. For now, it’s to two cities, but we’ll add Gdansk and Poznan soon. And the theatre? It hadn’t made sense for a long time. But... something was pulling me there. I don’t know. Maybe one day I’ll open my own theatre. What about you? Won’t you get involved in something? What with? My debts? You know, I thought you were more ambitious. My God, is that you? Don’t you recognise me? You married me to that Pole from West Germany! Oh, yes. Hello. - Hello. - And how is your husband? Poor man, he is dead. I’m sorry. Let me introduce myself. I’m Stefan Sapieja. He died about two months ago. Oh, I’m so sorry, really. He was very ill from the beginning. But he was a great man, he left almost everything to me. Now I have to take care of that business. I came to Warsaw just to see Jurek. Do you remember him? My first fiancée, the one you arranged for me to meet. I’m taking him with me. We are getting married soon, and that thanks to you. That’s fantastic! I am very glad that things worked out so well for you. Please, maybe you’ll have a drink with us? No, no. I’m in a hurry. We still have a lot of things to do before we leave. But maybe you’d come to Germany and manage one of the motels? - Me? - Do you speak German? I would give you very good terms. You have a good eye for business. Besides, I would feel safe with you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Ah... here we are... Please, write to me. Oh, thank you very much. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well? So, what do you intend to do? I think I’ll have a drink. I don’t understand it, I really don’t. What is it you don’t understand? It’s a stroke of luck. I have to pay off my debts. What will we live on? But you don't know anything about it! Running a motel is not a big deal. So far, every business you had was a failure. It wasn’t all my fault! I wouldn’t say so. Look, this is a chance. We can all go together. Mateusz will learn German. I don’t want to go. Don’t interfere! Why not? His opinion counts, too! Anyhow, I don’t want to go either. Why the heck not?! There is a chance to go abroad, earn some money, learn German... and you behave like you are doing me a favour! Do you want to live in poverty? Right! Tomorrow I go back to the university! Just don’t moan about it in the future! Dad, they’re talking about you on the radio! The Royal Scientific Society prize was awarded to the book "This is a Beautiful Life" for promoting universal values in a world threatened by commercialism and the ruthless struggle for success. The prize awarded to Piotr Nowosad is considered the highest distinction in the field of sociology in Europe. On the night of the 27th to the 28th of this month... Hello? Yes, that’s me. Good morning. The British Embassy. In a week? All right, I’ll come tomorrow to pick up the forms. Yes, I’ll come for sure. Thank you. Excuse me, could you comment briefly on your success? I'm so surprised that I really don't know what to say. Yes, hello? Yes, I’m going to London in a week. Of course, I'm glad. I am very happy. Thank you very much, goodbye. Well, four years ago I gave permission to translate my book... No, he can’t come up now. This book has been published in Poland several years ago, right? Yes, that’s right, but it didn’t arouse much interest. Polish Radio, Programme 3. Is it true that you received 50,000 pounds prize money? I don't know anything about it. I just found out. What is your attitude towards the re-privatization of the economy? Do you believe in the sustainability of reforms in Poland? So, you have achieved success and what next? What will you use this award for? What is your attitude to the Church? Dad, look! What do they want to do with it? Who the hell knows? They’re looking for a place, but can’t decide. And who would have expected that it would turn out this way? The book, the prize... Now I can easily pay off my debts and then do my postdoctoral, write a book, pursue scientific work. Although... on the other hand... Well... That would be a surprise for everyone I could invest it in something. 50,000! That really is capital!
