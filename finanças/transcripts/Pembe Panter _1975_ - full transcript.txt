Calm down, you animal. Come... Come closer... He is lost again? What are you saying?! This is our final game. And you still couldn't find Zeki. Mr. Boss, we looked everywhere. We were searching non-stop for the last 48 hours. If I don't see Zeki in goalie, all of you can quit your jobs. What happened? Do you think Crazy Mary lost him too? Don't worry, boss. Zeki loves woman. He won't leave. We have three woman. They won't let him go. If Zeki doesn't play tomorrow, we will be the champion! - Here comes the other girls. - Let's move on. - They are coming! - They are coming! - What do you want? - You don't involve in this. Here he is, boss. I don't understand. This is a balloon, a balloon... ...I can tell what is a balloon. This is a balloon. Let me see. Your boobs... This is enough! Move on, we are going! No, I will catch you! Look at there! Come here, I caught you. What is this? You look like a careless fancy dog. Are you proud of this? Move, we are moving to camp. Move! Go away!

What is that? Please Mr. Hunter. Don't shot me. Because I'm no animal. I thought you were an animal. Hunter, what is this? And this guy? Whats happening? Mr. Guard, I'm no animal. I'm searching for you since yesterday. Animal! No, you are confusing me with something else. I'm Muttalip! Boss is looking for you. Move! How could you explain this animal... This animal is escaped from the cage. Don't move! Take this. Just bought it. Eat. What an animal. They should put you in this cage, instead of me. Do I look like an animal? Shut up. This is what the boss said. You are an animal. Thats it. - Why are you still talking? - Look at me, bro. Have you ever seen an talking animal? We have seen a lot of things here... - Bro, just listen to me. - Shut up! You are an animal. Take this. Here is the paper. Boss signed it. He is not an animal. Okay now thats it. There is a boss sign, so you are no animal. Come on, get him out. Sorry bro, you are no animal. Sorry bro, but you are an animal for sure. You are the legend goalie Panther Zeki, look at yourself. Shut up. Or I will tell them to take you into bear cage. Just move. Right into the match. - I'm not going. - Come here. Take him! Show us, Zeki! You know, this match is critical for us. I know that, but you don't. - Why? - You are making me play for this game. Come on. Stop joking around. Give me one second. No, you can't go anywhere. Should I piss my pants? Okay, go. Be quick. God damn it. Wow, brother. I hope you play in our team. You are footballer, right? Wrestler? What do you do? I'm a sportsman, darling. Wow, I have never seen a sportsman like this. Come on! Where are you? - My friend, I'm really surprised. - Why? In the shower, a man like this... turned out to be like this... Stop the nonsense talk. Come on kids, we are going out! Let's go! - You too, come on. - Where? To the pitch, for the match. Come on! I'm excited again. Stop with piss. Focus on the match. Take this ball. Come on, go. Come here, come. Hello, hello. Why there are so many people? Is it a special day or something? - You take this. - Come here. I'm so shy! Let's go! Good luck! You too* Take off your shirt. - You forget your auspicious? - Okay... Come on, quick. Take off your underwear, too. Come on, with all these people! Just take it off! Be quick, you have another one under that. Be careful please. Keep your morale high. It's alright, don't worry. Everyone is screaming to me. - Come to center. - Why? You will stand there. When the ball comes, you will need to stay there to save it. Okay, okay. No worries. I got it. See... See... You said center, and they scored from the left side. Don't be sad. Don't be sad. Come here, look at me. When the ball comes, you need to jump and save it. Not now, when the ball comes! I injured my foot. Come on, get up. It comes! It comes! Jump! Jump! I jumped! - God damn it. - How could you not save it? Didn't I tell you to reach and save the ball? Like this? Are you in hotel? How many goals they scored? How many?! - How the hell I know?! You count - God damn it. My dear, open the radio. I think the game has started. Okay, dear. I'm curious how are they doing without me. They will concede 3-4 goals at least. Of course, darling. They can't do anything without you. And the yellow-blue team, is 1-0 behind now. Didn't I tell you? Zeki... He is performing incredibly bad today. Goalie Zeki, screwed his entire team with his poor performance. Now they are coming from the left wing... ...and Engin took the shot! And goal. Goal. ...Zeki didn't even touch the ball when it was in front of him. Zeki ?! I'm Zeki, and I'm here! So who is he? If he is Zeki, who am I? What does this mean, Zeki? Whats happening? I don't know, too. - I saved it this time! - Don't come! Not like this... God damn it. I save the ball, it doesn't work. I miss the ball, it doesn't work. I'm not playing. Stand up! Stand up! Focus! Just don't get involved. Finally, like this! See, you saved it! It wasn't me. It was my ass. Doesn't matter. You saved it. It's coming! Save it! Come to center! Kick the ball! Kick it! Goal! Come here. Let me kiss you. This is how you score a goal. God damn you. You shut up. You don't know shit. Take one from the back. Shot it. Let it be a memory. Give me that-- Oh, number 2, come here. Why did you scored while they are photographing me? Disrespectful kid. Wow! Ball is so far away. It's not far away... It's in your back. It's goal... I will eat you. Why didn't you grab the ball in the pitch, like now? I tried. It doesn't work. It just goes away. Please Zeki. In the second half just focus on the game. I beg you. Just try hard please. Sure thing. I'm not going to let you down. I will try hard, I promise. Come on, it's time, kids. Let's go. This time play better or I will beat you! Yeah, play better! Shut up. Move. - You screwed us all. - Shut up, stupid. Please guys, really do your best this time. - Muttalip! - Muttalip! Come here! - I'm coming. - Come. We played Toto, remember? We guessed 12 correct. And if you win this one too, it will be 13! What?! 13? Yes, if it's 13 we will be rich. Then we can get married. Really? Married? Let me give you a lucky kiss. One more, one more... Yes! If it's 13, we are getting married! No more conceding goals! Well done, Zeki! Let's go! - Nice, very nice. - Shut up. Go away, stupid. Shut up, go away. Go away, I'm coming! Goal! I scored! FIN
