THE BASILISKS Where we live, after lunch we take a nap. Everyone falls into the arms of Morfea who could be our patron saint and carried in procession instead of St Anthony. I can't sleep. There are too many questions unanswered. It's a sacred hour. Francesco reads intellectual books... but at the end he falls asleep. And will dream of being Gordon, Superman, Nembo Kid. And Sergio... had to correct his pupils' homework! Enrichetta's five daughters get ready to go to sleep. Brush your hair out... Brush your hair out. How much time it takes to find a husband! The old sleep in front of 'The Communist Youth Center'. Here's the late Salvatore! Look the house is strangely quiet. It's rare... To gain command, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law... are always fighting. The barber is taking a nap in his shop. The pharmacist sleeps peacefully at home... he has a calm wife... 2 ugly daughters... but they'll marry anyway: Having a pharmacy they are very well off. It's siesta time. Mrs. Ada... who arrived from Pisa 60 years ago and married to a rich landowner, doesn't sleep she does the accounts. In the next room, her son... sleeps. He was a good boy... but he married an ex ballerina... with dyed hair. She's nervous. She lives here since one month, no one ever saw her... but they call her 'long legs. Who knows how long she walked on those legs. It was a good idea to relax marrying Pinuccio. And now she has to have fun. It's siesta time. Even Rosina sleeps: The official who consoles solitary hearts. Damned by half of the town, invoked by the other half. In 7 years she gave birth to 5 children. She can sleep peacefully now, she's a relative. The doctor isn't sleeping, she can't: She's an autodidact and a woman. She must study more than others or else it'll be the end for her. It's siesta time of a summer day. Let's pick a day, any day... even of next year, it doesn't matter... This is the day of the inauguration of the cultural club. Silence! "Finally, after so long..." "We can meet again at the new Cultural Club..." "Which had been closed in 1944." "Today it has been reopened." "Let me exclaim, being your President..." "Nominated by all of you..." "Let me exclaim..." "Eureka, eureka!" "This period from 1944 up to today..." "Has been a sad one..." "Because we professionals and respectful people..." You're always bothering me! Don't bother me anymore! "We have undergone the humiliation..." "Of being joined together wit people of little or no respect." "Today, this is all over." "Our club has come back to life." "Let's hear three cheers for the club!" Did they go by? - Of course. - They come past just to show off. As soon as they go by I'm going to stop them. It's three months you want to stop them but you didn't even say "good evening". It's not easy. But today I'll stop them. But why go through with it? Are you in love? Neither am I. Let's forget about it! Antonio, is it you? Sleep... It isn't decent... for a woman to go on TV. - Would you go? - God forbid! It's a matter of prejudice. Would you marry someone like that? I don't know... I didn't shave... See you tomorrow. You're wooing her, huh? No, I'm not interested... A teacher... They're nowhere to be seen. Here's Mrs. Enrichetta with her brats, where are they going? To church, to mass. Only pious humbugs to to church. It's an excuse to show off her daughters. She has five females to marry. We're going to church. Say hello! Good morning! You have founded a club, organize some nice dance party. Now that it's open again, get something going! It's possible that nothing ever happens here? You youngsters either emigrate or you day dream! Those who stay... have non initiative. Thank you. How rude, you deserve a smack. Excuse me. In any case, organize this party. We'll see... Good bye. Good bye. Good evening guys. Here we go. We could organize one. No one would come. I'd try it... They don't let the girls out around here they're old fashioned. No party then. Many people move to the city... why? Sooner or later all leave... because they find a job. What job?! For many it's the pits. Look, the doctor! She's well off... she's going to buy a car. I admire her. A poor illiterate, orphan... she studied hard and got a degree in medicine. To earn a living... she must have been a trollop in the city. If she can afford a car... she must swindle someone. No, she cures the farmers. Still those girls are nowhere. He was happy to have emigrated to Austria, but he died there... Poor thing, he had a brain tumor! Shall I stop them? They're even alone. What are you doing? My God, today he's going to stop them. - Coming to the club? - I'm coming. By the way, I was looking for you. Me? You must have noticed that I noticed you. Miss... I hope you won't disappoint my dream. You're a decent boy and I like you but you'll have my answer in 3 days. Very well. Who is the other girl? - Who is she? - A girl. My cousin. She has... two wooers: Antonio and Sergio. The answer in 3 days. Rosina knows how to please men! How are the sewing machine sales going? No one buys them. You were so happy to get the agency. When I suggest them, they seem interested but... It's the mentality. It's a good thing my brother is a blue collar worker... only my father doesn't approve. Of course, he wanted his son to have a degree. A town full of graduates. Every 4 inhabitants at least 3 have a degree! And with what result? You're all here barely making a living. This is a slow death. If it weren't for my father... I would have left. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? I'm studying to get a degree. Then you'll teach math for 50.000 lira a month? I'll become a notary like my grandfather. He desired it so much he wrote it in his will. It's an excuse to justify you laziness. You're like me... I'm embroidering my trousseau. What for... I'm not getting married! But I still hope to leave this place. What is it? Piquant salami: Makes the dead come alive. It's always harder to find... due to progress! Before everyone raised their own pig in the bedroom with the chickens and the donkey and salami could be found. Due to progress no one raises pigs anymore and no one makes their own salami. I wish real progress... would get here. Even my uncle up in Turin was looking for salami... there aren't any there. We landowners could join together and form a cooperative and instead of sowing wheat, we'd produce salami. Ask Francesco, I'm not into that stuff. Coming! - Have a good day. - See you soon. "Article 1160..." "Usucaption of the universality of personal property." "See 816..." "The real right to possession..." Be quiet! I'll kick you in the rear! Go home! They were only playing. "Usucaption..." Antonio, you're not studying? I have a headache. - Anybody home? - Nobody's home. All right. 'Long legs'... used to be a ballerina. Imagine... then she found a dunce and settled down. What a beautiful woman! Speaking of legs. Did you ever see Pinuccio's wife? The day she arrived but I hardly got a look at her. Pinuccio has every right to keep her at home. Ever since she came she's been the talk of the town. Aren't you curious about that blonde dame? Are you kidding! The barons built nice prisons! And what did they get? Let's go. The barons have all disappeared due to taxes and expropriation. Here you see the house of the Grazianis. The De Andrea family still holds out here. What does the countess say about the bride? Your mind is fixed on that lady! Anyway, the countess completely ignores her daughter-in-law. Of course, a ballerina... But Countess Ada should be more open-minded and then her son is happy... But a ballerina in the family... - He's going to the doctor. - So? - He'll get undressed. - He's old. But he's a man! My answer is "yes". My cousin chose Antonio. She chose Antonio. And now? We must wait for the right moment for an appointment. I hope those two won't start gossiping. Why? I don't like it... if I get word of it I'll start hitting. You're exaggerating! - And who is that? - It's the barber, he had moved to Rome. - And Rome? - I'm back, I wasn't in good condition. - Physically or financially? - What? Physically or financially? They cast an evil eye on me. I got sick and the doctors couldn't understand what it was. Then my mother wrote to me... saying someone here cast an evil eye on me. And I can only get rid of it here. Got a cigarette? You believe in the evil eye? These are things for little people. My mother keeps garlic and amulets behind the door. Mine too. - Who's with your father? - A mischief-maker. You have to pay the surveyor. He made you get the grant-in-aid... now you don't want to pay him? I already gave him what I owed him. You gave him 10.000 lira instead of 200.000. I'll denounce him. What he did was illegal, but you're his accomplice. I'm not giving him a cent! Too bad for you! - I'll take a legal action. - You'll lose. What do you want from me? I'm a notary, you need a lawyer. Let's form a cooperative and make salami... We could also open a cheese factory. It won't be easy to convince the others! Let's try. I brought the gold for the maidens. Go home right away! You're acting like the bad brother, she came for me. She's grown: She's very pretty. Let's go to Bari to see the revue! Such beautiful ballerinas! I don't have a cent! Ask you father or you mother for the money. - But they don't give them to me. - Try to convince them! Come on, let's go to Bari. Where's dad? Oh Christ! - Dad? - What do you want? I had to buy some texts to study on, - I need 1.000 lira. - And what do you have to do with it? I'm going to Bari to consult a colleague. To see the revue! I know everything. You want to all go see the ballerinas. Francesco, the farmer's son, the friend of your heart, has been saying it all day. Waste 1.000 lira to see a pair of legs. But aren't you ashamed to ask me for money? I studied and I even worked. You don't feel like studying and you're even an idiot! You have the courage to ask me for money! With all the money I spend to make you study! 1.000 lira! You should be bringing money home. You're 25, you neither graduated nor did you marry. 1.000 lira! Shame on you! Do you need to raise your voice? Now don't start! Always with these four... Always in the street or at the club. Like you. How dare you say that?! After all I've done for you! You turn against me and you're even a liar. You think I'm stupid? Shame on you! You have no dignity! 1.000 lira! I knew you wouldn't give it to me. I'm not giving you a cent. You have the guts to come and ask for 1.000 lira! You're an exploiter, a liar and a thief! I can't believe it! I'd better leave, God knows what might happen! Your father is right, what are you going to do in Bari? You can watch the ballerinas on TV. They wear a size 8 bra. - Have a nice stroll. - I just passed by chance. We also passed here by chance. - Have you seen the bride? - Yes, yes... 'Long legs'... She says that this town stinks. What a delicate nose! - But her husband didn't slap her? - He tried... but she treats her husband badly. She may be rude but she's beautiful! It's not a classical beauty... She's sexy! - And provocative. - She says she's bored. - I know what I'd do to her! - Me too. What a breast! It comes out of the balustrade! It's a disgrace! And this Mr. Zampa doesn't have to do anything more. He speak badly about the south of Italy! These films denigrate our region! Instead it is all a fervor of artistic works and industries work hard. It would take more state aid. The state should be examining its conscience. Not only does it not help us, but it cripples us with taxes... But you're cheating! So what do we want to do? Just like the government in Rome! Yeah and we're the stupid ones! You won again! It's impossible to play with you! He's a lucky person! The revue's nothing compared to last night! Not the ballerinas' legs but 'long legs'! Pinuccio's wife! - You saw her? - Yes, it was out of this world... She got undressed on the balcony. - You didn't go up? - How could I? Go on. I was passing by, she was on the balcony. Half naked... in a dressing gown. See-through? Of course, you could see her big breasts. They must have been at least 7 kilos. She looks at me... What a pain... Giovannino gave it to you? If your father knew... you're friends with a farmer you, the son of a notary... Say something, don't sit there like a mummy. What are you thinking? 'Don't think about it'. It's the record my cousin sent me from the States. He's a new singer. Says he's a very good modern singer. I got these books, do you want them? - You won't read them? - I'll read them later. I don't like it. I don't like vocal records. You stopped to speak with Luigi?! That's right. What did he say? We spoke about books... Which? Mystery stories... I lent them to him. What, now you're reading mystery stories? In this family no one has ever read anything! So, that means all of us have to be ignorant? Be quiet or I'll smack you! An agricultural cooperative is ridiculous! They won't give them a cent! Your son shouldn't get involved! Get our name mixed up in such things! A cooperative is not a good deal! But dad, I... You're an idiot! That's what you always say. You're an idiot: You're our disgrace! Mother, won't you defend me? Stop it! Be quiet, come on. They tell him: Give us your field, it yields only 100 lira! 100 lira a year are always 100 lira! Forget about business deals, concentrate on studying! Or you'll teach cads for the rest of your life! You're the one who found me the job to earn some money! I would have gone to Rome to study! You're accusing me? I work like a mule to support the family! You're only an exploiter! You'll see where you'll end up, in jail! I hope soon, so I won't hear you anymore! You failed in educating your son! He has absolutely no respect for me! Be quiet, come on. That's enough! Don't get involved, keep your stand you're not any better! What did I do? I'll speak to the pharmacist. I don't want to marry his daughter. You have to! That's why I made you study pharmaceutics. Elenuccia is a good match, she has a pharmacy. Clear? But I'm young. It's your fault if I want to rush things. What did he do? I don't know and don't want to know. But the whole town saw him with a girl... - Maria Rosa. - But that's a girl. She comes from a family of farmers, she's got nothing to lose. It would be great if she were to marry a graduate. But Elenuccia is fat. - Put her on a diet. - She's ugly. Pretty women are unfaithful. Where are we going? To see the 'cousins'. What have I got to do with them? I wasn't chosen! - They'll come with their aunt. - No, come on... We have deliberately the appointment here. What's the matter? Don't run away! Calm down! Don't worry, I won't hurt you! What happened! Come on, tell me. What happened? That dirty old gravedigger bothered her. But she was crying because a friend of hers stole the 100 lira the gravedigger had given her. How beastly! They're poor, peasants and wretched. - You have a cigarette? - No. She's Annunziata's sister... the one of the mishap. What mishap, she got pregnant because... Nicola raped her, everyone knows but they make believe they don't. The father didn't avenge her honour. The father couldn't go against the landlord. Excuses. The girl enjoyed it and it was convenient for the father. They're that kind of people. Poverty is tough. What about honor? Sometimes honor is a luxury. Here they are with their aunt. I told you... you're an idiot. They promised they were going to come alone. It's better that we leave. Miss, excuse me... - And the appointment? - We must be cautious. We can but wait and hope. No appointment for now, we must be cautious. What did you decide about the cooperative? You'll join? Yes, but I don't believe in it. I'm joining in spite of my father. Too many farm labourers here. AN ILL FARM LABOURER GETS ENOUGH TO DIE ON - £60 Lets go to the club. We can't go on like this... the pay is low. Who are they? Tourists. There's nothing to see here! - Someone wants you. - Me? Antonio? I'm your aunt Maria! I'd never have recognized you! What a nice surprise. I'm on vacation... I thought I'd come visit you. Where's Uncle? At the Balearic Islands. This is Luciano Bonfanti... my nephew. What a nice young man! He's a friend of mine. I haven't been here for 15 years, how are your parents? Mom is at home... dad at the club. Of course, the card game, cos they play like loonies here from morning to night. They have wonderful faces! Calm down: I won't start up a fight. I don't know you. They're not kidding here after what happened in 1947. What happened in 1947? I don't know, do you know? Some riot... Set on fire the party headquarters, the agricultural offices and large landowners' buildings. Didn't you know? I don't get involved with the farmers. But it happened in this area. What communist culture! I'm reading a book on the Apulian farm labourers. A very interesting survey... you didn't read it? Unfortunately no. Accompany them to see my father. I'm out of gas. The gas station is over there. Beautiful lady! Luigi settled down with the pharmacy... and Antonio? He studies and teaches in the morning. - And Enrico? - I rarely see him. - We've already met. - No. - We've already met. - No. Of course, in Bologna. What are you saying?! It didn't work. The farm labourers are fighting hard. The landowners went bankrupt because of them now what do they want? An agricultural reform. They're never happy. Sooner or later they'll manage... to nationalize agriculture. And we'll have a good laugh. It'll be a victory for them... they'll be better off that way. Don't speak of politics with Luciana who can go on talking for 2 days. Who do you vote for? We're tied to the past. You mean you're fascist?! Incredible, why are you fascist? Because we are. With an iron hand such things wouldn't happen. You'd have the nerve to beat up these poor men! He's fascist! I'd prefer to leave. There's only one cinema... and it's for kids. - How much does it cost? - 30 lira. What about television? Women watch it at home. What do you do in the evenings? We meet at the club. A club for nobles? There aren't anymore nobles, professionals. What about girls? They keep them locked up at home... they're old fashioned here. That means no girls! What are you doing here? I was born in this area but at the age of 13 I ran away. I thought you came from Rome. If it were for my father, I'd still be here. How can you stand it here, leave, run away! It's not easy. Did a relative of yours help you find a job? No, Rome offers a vast variety of jobs and you live well there. Is it true you're leaving? Yes, they're taking me to Rome. When? Right away. They want to leave immediately. They're not staying? No, there aren't any nice hotels here... with hot water. I'm leaving. Lucky. When will you be back? I don't know. - You will be back? - Of course. He's going to Rome... I'll be doggone! What a strange smell... How can they live with such a stench? Let's leave it open! - Don't travel like that. - We like the breeze. Behave. He's in good hands. Have a nice trip and don't go too fast. Don't go too fast! Don't go too fast! Don't go too fast! And Antonio leaves. His fate has finally come... disguised as an aunt... and takes him away. He leaves us all behind all the people and situations that up to today were part of his daily life. Away, towards Rome... far away... so beautiful! Why didn't you tell him? He wasn't interested in going to Rome, I was! Why didn't you tell him? They only had room for one in the car... they invited Antonio because he's older than you. It's only a trip. Surely there'll be another occasion. It seems as though you hate living here! I hate it: I want to leave! This is an uncivilized place. - Our town? - No, Italy in general. The only news in the papers is about crimes and robberies. Every civil country has capital punishment. A cigarette. Those two are always fighting. I've been waiting for 5 years, that's enough. The head of the family is your son! And I'm his wife, that means I command! I command! Did you understand? He's the son of a notary... you can't marry him, he's not the right man for you. He was just kidding you. Don't worry about it, you're a good girl there are so many better than him. He didn't love you. It's better this way. Very well, the two lovebirds will marry in May. Shall we read the contract? It isn't a real contract, I just jotted it down we agree on the most part. Of course, now we're relatives. Anyway we can read it just the same. What you want is done well. Pair of linen embroidered sheets complete with embroidered pillow cases total 6. Pair of cotton sheets with pillow cases, 12. 18 pairs of sheets? They're only two not an army! If she doesn't have them it's okay. She has them, my sister is a princess. All of them at once is exaggerated. When she'll need them we'll talk about it. Okay, you decide the number. Let's say 6 pairs in cotton and 4 in linen. You'll never see me again! I'm leaving! I don't care a damn about your money! I never want to see you again! And not even that old dotard of your mother! I was supposed to settle down for the rest of my life! Is this life? I'd rather starve to death! What are you people looking at? What's so funny? You should be crying not laughing! Please, don't leave me! Having fun? Now let me pass! What ugly faces! Go to hell you... and your mother! You're the first one we'll take from the cooperative. You studies, reads, evolved, you can understand. It's a good idea... for small landowners. I like salami, I accept. But don't mention my name you know the mentality in this town. If they hear my name, you'll risk losing a good number of participants. It's a closed community... they defend their rights like in the Middle Ages. Ask Countess Ada for her patronage. She's important here. They fear her and admire her. She's lived here for 60 years but is always on her own. She's good landlord. Her farm labourers never gave her any problems. During the harvest period she was in the fields from daybreak till dark supporting her farmers. This is why she's always been respected. For her labourers she's still a countess. If she'd support you you'd only need her approval. Excuse me, I have patients to see. Ask her and let me know! You have been good, eh... really good! Did you wash yourself? I haven't been unfaithful. I already have a lot to worry about with the land the year before last the linen field went on fire taxes are increasing. We wanted some advice about the cooperative. With the reform they've taken away my best lands to give to the peasants. And taxes increase. If you sell they don't give you a cent. Then with my son's mishap did he have to fall in love with that lady. Now the women peasants wear lipstick and don't want to work. We could use some prisoners here like in 1918. They worked hard and you didn't need armed pickets. I want to earn less but I want to be the one controlling my property. I won't join any cooperative. I'll see you at the club. What is it? A funeral... an abortion. The new road will not pass on my property. I was very clear with the building firm. I don't believe that the land will increase in value. I have to keep my farm labourer locked inside the property or they don't work. With the road nearby they'll stop to talk with the passers by and won't work. They're not going to cheat me! I went to the city. I know very influential people. I did what I had to now the road will be built 3 km from my property. He's going to marry the pharmacist's daughter and run for the party on the Right. Before he wasn't interested in politics. But your grandparents were fascists. It's better to be on the top, than on the bottom that's why he's running. He has no ideas and no ideals... doesn't care a damn about anybody he hasn't pity for anyone. He wants to be on the top, the others on the bottom. That's my brother. The other one's in Rome, we have no news. I want to get out of here! We mustn't run away, we must stay here in order to change things. If we leave, who will be left here? You're no longer interested in the cooperative? We must work hard. Tomorrow we'll ask other people... tomorrow... I told you tomorrow. You must resign yourself, your daughter-in-law is rebellious. She wants to command. Don't worry about it and mind your own business. It's late. I'm going to mass. Don't worry. Don't worry. My God, what are you doing? Damn, it's pouring! What are you doing here by yourself? I just got here! What a horrible smell. The cigarettes. I've come back from Rome! How are you? They saw you get off the bus, I ran to see you. Thought you'd never come back. I'm back but I'm going back to Rome. What? It's a whole different world. But when I got here I felt my heart beat. You look good, so elegant... who helped you out? My uncle. He wants me there. - You're leaving? - Tomorrow. I'm going to finish college in Rome. I take a shower twice a day. - Isn't it bad for you. - I'm fine. I met people who joke around and laugh. Without problems? They have them but they're happy. I learned incredible, fabulous things. A hairdresser earns 500.000 lira a month. They live well. They're really nice and lot's of fun. They work and have fun. I'm wearing knee socks... ankle socks are for cads. They transformed me. - They treated me like a dirty boy. - How dare they? No, they joke... they're really lot's of fun. Every night to a restaurant, a nightclub, a cinema... lot's of girls... They spend up to 20.000 lira a day! It's the truth. The 'Roman' is back! What the devil are you wearing? What a great life in Rome! But you're back. But I'm leaving tomorrow. You found a job? You're a guest at your uncle's? You won't be a guest forever! What are you up to? The big city impressed you? Money, huh? There's got to be something fishy! Even there there's poverty... frauds, bills... Why go through with it? You're better off here. You have your job. - You'll get your degree then... - Then, calmly... "If you listen to us, you'll never leave", says Antonio. But he wants to go back to Rome. When the alarm went off to catch the bus going to Rome he turned his back to it. He always postpones... to tomorrow... Meanwhile he still goes on about Rome, about the women, with wigs, diamonds about the drunken blonde, the brunette who fell in love. On and on... Everyone knows he's never going to leave. Why? Who knows? Maybe he lacks something... like all of us. That's why our life passes by... and we hardly do anything. Oh, we are those that continue living for our climate, our landscapes and our history. Antonio still goes on about Rome, Francesco about the cooperative. They've only become things to talk about. We do a lot of talking here. We talk... And we talk... Title-House: Issaverdens - Rome
