Hey, all you Shark Week fans out there. Welcome back, it's our third summer here at Little Happy an abandoned fishing village in the Mozambique Channel. The residents were some of the first victims of rising sea levels. 800 people used to live on this tiny manmade island. Now there are only two left. And in case you were thinking this is someone else's life this... is what the Florida Keys will look like. And Houston, and New Orleans. But... there's another side to Little Happy. The nursery... out there. Alright. You wanna see? Let's go. The fish drew the fishermen who built this village on a coral reef right next to this nursery. It's home to one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. Here in Little Happy, my team and I are creating a database called the Triton which uses sonar and AI to identify and study organisms in a targeted area, like this canyon.. ...from great white sharks to fishes small as a centimeter long. Sharks return here each year to feed mate and give birth. Their home, like ours, is under attack from climate change. Carbon emissions are absorbed by the ocean more and more every year resulting in warmer water temperatures rising sea levels, food source loss ocean acidification and species extinction. - You okay, Shaw? - A lot of sharks. Let's go. My father, Nick Collins, believed that studying sharks like us, apex predators at the top of the food chain helps us understand and improve the health of entire ecosystems. If sharks are in trouble, we are, too. Emma. No. Back off, Shaw. Stop. I want you to meet Sally. She's the great white who led us to this nursery after we tagged her. We've been studying how she and her neighbors are adapting to climate change in real time. 'Are you out of your mind?' If you stay calm and redirect.. ...Sally's just reminding me who I am. And who she is. Don't try this at home. 'Emma!' Damn it! - 'Ah.' - 'Emma!' Emma. Fuck! Let me look. - It's okay. I'm okay, Shaw. - Give me your arm. - Give me your arm. - I'm okay. You're bleeding, you're not alright. - 'There's blood in the water.' - 'Fuck.' Oh, God. Come on, let's get back. That was amazing. Ah, you can learn more about our research on our website. All charitable contributions go to the Nick Collins Fin Foundation. I'm Dr. Emma Collins, and that's Shaw and we are... Waterblog. - That shark wasn't playing. - Sally? We're old friends. Healthy respect, remember? Sounds like something my dad would've said. You're right. Emma, I just want you to be a little safer it's all I'm saying. Listen, Shaw, I know my dad was your CO and you feel like you owe him but I'm way too old for parenting advice, alright? But I love you. I need a beer. You coming? - Yeah, you're good. - I make it look good. Aw. It's her. It's Bella. Looks like the nets did our jobs for us. We gotta catch the other three, Lucas. - There's no time left. - How are we gonna do that? You're the shark expert, and if we can't track their mum anymore, it's over. Bella was a good mother. She was taking her kids to the best all-you-can-eat buffet in town. ♪ Wey yo wey yo ♪ Yo. ♪ Wey yo wey yo ♪ - Spin. - That was awesome. And the underwater live feed? That was great too, check it. She's the great white who led us to this nursery after we.. It's gonna get like 5000 likes easy. I'm gonna get it up on Facebook and Insta by tonight. - What's up with the drone? - Right. So, uh, one of the servos is burnt out, but I-I'm on it. Miya. - Are you-are you okay? - Anything new on the Triton? Um, yeah. Um.. I still can't find him. - Who? - Nemo. You want a rec for a decent PhD program you better try harder than that. - What? - No problem, Dr. Collins. - So what do you got? - So.. I finished the population survey... and you're right. The great whites has declined from last year, 6%. - Adults or pups? - Both. Surprised, Dr. Collins? Nah, it can't be right. Must be a glitch. Hey, Spin, how's our coverage on the Triton? Uh, right now we're at 65% of the nursery which should give us pretty decent numbers. That's not good enough, Spin. Let's take care of some of our blind spots, alright? We'll outfit another... half dozen sensors. - On it. - We'll set 'em up tomorrow. ♪ Mmm ♪ That's a nice catch. We could've made good money with these at the restaurant, Nandi. I know, seems like a while ago. Uh-huh. Bahari, this is no way to live. We should leave. This is the only home we've ever known, Nandi. It's gone. Look around. There's nothing here for us. - Where would we go, huh? - Anywhere. We'll figure it out. Oh, boy. I know that look. Mama had the same one. Ah, Look, Nandi, could we talk about this later? t's always later with you, Bahari. But it's okay. So, go clean up. This was delicious, Nandi. Thank you. Our pleasure. - Spin? - Hmm? Spin, why don't you eat fish, huh? Spin's a paleo vegan, a pegan. Bahari, responsible and sustainable food choices are not only good for the environment they're good for your health, too, so.. They are fish. Save your speech, ah? The world is full of speeches and look where that's got us. On that, we agree. Shots? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - May I, Dr. Collins? Listen, Miya, we're drinking together, you can call me Emma. Go ahead. Hmm. - Oh. - You are so sexy. Did I, did I just say that out loud? Oh, okay. You know, we all know about you two. Okay, so, we have customs for drinking in Japan, and it is considered polite to pour for others. And the young... pour for the old. - 'Oh, damn.' - Me! What about him? I'm your superior, that's not cool. - Here. - Thank you. - Kampai! - Kampai! That's not enough, you know. 'Supplies aren't due for a week.' Yeah, and it's not the trash barge. 'Have you seen that boat before?' Hmm... no. Who knows? They might have some clothes on there. Get a shirt that fits you. 'Let's go check it out.' Emma. I can't believe it. - Who's the hot guy? - Richie Lowell. They went to grad school together. Wait, together or... like together? - Richard? - Hey. How you doing? Oh. Together. Wow. I haven't seen you in forever. Yeah. What are you doing here? We need your help. Guys? This is Richard and Lucas. This is Spin, he's our MIT tech wizard. - Uh, Shaw. You remember Shaw. - Good to see you, Shaw. Good to see you too, Richie. Uh, it's Richard, or Dr. Lowell now. - Your call, Eugene. - And this is Miya. She's, um, one of our summer students 'on loan from the Toba Institute' 'of Maritime Technology. Did I get that right?' Yeah. Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you, Miya. - Nice to meet you. 'These boys need a little help from our Triton.' - What are you looking to find? - Three bulls. It's a bad neighborhood for bulls they'd be like sushi to the whites. - 'Lucas?' - Usually that'd be the case. We got a tracker in one. We're sure that they were headed this way. A half dozen people went missing about 100 miles up the Orange River. At first, the locals thought it was crocs. - Turns out it was bull sharks. - 'What?' But Sharks don't exhibit that kind of behavior unless they're stressed or hungry, you know that. Exactly, we were hired to stop them and to find out what's wrong. Wait, so they kill people on a river. Bull sharks can survive in freshwater. Yeah, I picked right up on that. They work together... or they hunted in a pack. That's not possible. - Together like dolphins? - That's right. I've seen it myself. I find this really hard to believe. Okay. Miya.. You got anything on the Triton? Yeah. So.. ...it's been at least a week since I've seen any carcharhinus leucas. - 'A few dozen great whites.' - No bulls? 'Nope. Mm-mm.' There you have it. I guess that's goodbye and... good luck? It just looks like Waterblog. - You follow us? - What do you think? Yeah, it's a weird place to call home, Em. It's grim. Up here, yeah. Down there, it's, um, it's heaven. Just you and the fish? The way you like it? No sign of humanity around? I mean, who can blame you? Look what we've done. Hey, why is a double PhD in shark neurology out hunting sharks? Why don't you come aboard for a drink and I'll tell you? Welcome aboard. You've come down in the world, Richard. This thing can float? My employer likes to keep a low profile. We're gonna look around, see if we can locate our bulls. - 'Hey, Brown.' - 'What's up, boss?' - 'Uh, whiskey?' - 'I'm diving.' - 'I bet you are, too.' - 'Water it is.' 'That's cool.' Yeah. Hey, you ever think about us? Sure, sometimes. What do you think about? That it sucked that my dad died and you took that job in Sydney. But we're probably exactly where we should be. Probably. - Bella. - Yeah. - Is that the shark you tracked? - Yeah. I found her yesterday. Deceased. Just trying to figure out if I can learn anything from her brain. - Did you? - Unfortunately not. - Light's still on. - Oh. Here. So, who's paying? - Genotics Labs. - Oh. I know, I know, the corporate overlords. I do a few projects for them, they fund my research. So you're working for Big Pharma. Let's face it, climate change is here to stay, Emma. World's gonna get a whole lot smaller. And make some people a lot of money. - Sistine Chapel didn't... - Didn't pay for itself. Hey, um, listen.. Just stay out of the water until we've done our work. Okay? Just as a precaution. Well, thank you, but we're working here, too. - Same old Emma. - Same old Richard. - Can I check it out? - Sure, knock yourself out. Just, uh, don't touch anything that looks expensive, okay? Okay. Let's get it. - Hey, bro. You ready? - Hey, boss man. Oh, yeah. Take care of yourself down there. Here you go. 'Alright, Brown's leading the way and he's going the deepest.' 'Make sure you got his back, so he can go down further.' - Move in about 30 yards. - Copy that, sir. Miya, com check. 'I hear you loud and clear, Dr. Collins.' - Going deeper. - 'Careful.' 'There are sharks around you.' Okay, you are closing in on one of our blind spots now. Copy that, Miya. Headed for the nursery wall. 'Okay, team, how's it looking?' There's a lot of black tips out here, no bulls. 'I think we're gonna have to go deeper.' Activating the sensor now, Miya. Good for frequency and data. Next. 'Okay, Brown, you go deep, stay parallel with us.' - Copy. - You boys be safe. 'Okay, let's split up.' Roger that, boss. - Copy. - 'Happy hunting.' I'm headed for the next blind spot. 'Got you, Dr. Collins.' We got a problem. - Emma, what's wrong? - Fuck. I've got two large great whites down here. Fresh kills. I thought I told you to stay out of the water. - Richard... - Emma... Richard, there's two down there! Calm down. There's two dead sharks down there! I know, I know. Yeah, yeah. But you have to calm down. Emma, there is a bull in the field, it's big. Moving fast. - Richard, bull shark. - What? Get out the nursery now! It's in a vector towards one of their divers. Lucas, they've got a bull shark in the nursery coming our way, copy. 'Our lucky day, boys. Watch your six.' Got you, boss, our eyes are peeled. Come on, you sneaky fucks. 'Brown, where are you?' Rising southwest, depth, 90 feet. 'Brown, do you read me?' - Brown. - There he is. I see him. It's okay. Yeah, we see him. Okay. Shit! Come on, come on! I should get back to my team. Those great whites down there your bulls did that too? Yeah. Those sharks aren't acting like sharks, Richard. They prey on great white nurseries as a reliable food supply. Why didn't you tell us that to begin with, man? Great whites are faster and stronger they eat bull sharks for lunch. Not these. My theory is that they're adapting to climate change faster than the whites which is making them highly aggressive towards everything. I was hired to perform a neurological evaluation. So Genotics can make money off them? Oh, you know, Emma, I just lost a man down there. So what do we do? We don't get those sharks out of the water now, they'll destroy everything we're working to save. Most spooky thing I've ever seen in my life. The way Brown was driving that ACV like he didn't even know he was dead. It could be ten miles before his batteries died think about it. It could be any one of us. You, me. Not me. I knew Brown for 15 years had my back more times than I can count. And so if you have to talk about him.. ...show some respect. Gear up, we're wet in 30. - Copy that. - Okay. Emma, are you seriously gonna help them out? We are. We just lost a human being. And at least two mature great whites 'we can't afford to lose any more.' I know you and Richard were close... And I know you and Dad never liked him. Who gives a shit if I like him? I don't trust him. Do you? - Spin. - Yeah? Can you do a search history on a GPS tracking signal? Uh, well, it depends which kind of tracker. Well, the bull in Richard's lab, Bella it was tagged with an acoustic-to-radio conversion beacon. Wow, th-that's a really tricky piece of tech. But you can run a search history on... any GPS beacon. - Uh... - Can't you, Spin? Yeah. 'Course I can... I mean, I can try. - You can more than try. - Right, I... I'll do that. You ever heard of knocking, boys? We got a plan. Lucas? Folks, we think it's best to deploy a sub drone that mimics the movements and the electrical field of a seal. It will also chum out seal blood. - Sharks like seals. - Thank you for that. Look, we'll station ourselves in your nursery, and we'll use your Triton system as our spotter. And hopefully you'll warn us, yeah? Great. We'll get a man in here and you can show me how this system works. Thank you. Thank you for bringing a big strong man in here because this little girl with a degree in environmental acoustic propulsion engineering couldn't possibly handle it. No offense, Emma, but sometimes a big strong man just wants to help. And she is just a kid. - What you got there, fellas? - Haloperidol cocktails. Yeah, we'd prefer to take our bulls alive. Yeah, we've-we've got those too. But what are those? Explosive tipped. For when we don't want them alive. But this whole place is falling apart. One of those things hits a piling what's left of this village goes under. There's nothing to worry about, my men don't miss. I wanna know when your shark problem became our shark problem. Because we're all in this together. Well, kumba-fucking-ya, Richie. Em. I mean, you can't expect me to put my men in the water without defending themselves. Spin, give him access to our com system. Got it. And Miya, you see a bull, you let everyone know, okay? On it. Emma. Thank you. A great white. Look at this. 'Keep watching your back, these things move fast.' Sally's keeping to the sea floor. That's really weird because they've been chumming out seal blood like crazy. Maybe they are scared. I'll get the blood going when you're ready. Roger that. - Just give me the word, Lucas. - 'Copy that.' Can I ask you a question, Emma? 'Yeah, what?' Oh, no. We're doing the girl talk thing, aren't we? I like Spin. I mean... I really like him. Yeah, he's a sweet guy. Okay. Let's see where you've been, Thasos. If you're happy, go for it. Okay, wait, that's all you got for me? - "Don't worry, be happy"? - Yeah. Hey, I'm... good with fish, bad with people. Yeah, oh, yeah, you think that's funny? - Maybe. - Okay, great. Ready to send the drone back to your way. 'Roger that.' Oh, shit. - Bull shark! - Okay. Miya's got word, incoming bull. 175 degrees southwest, depth 18 and dropping. It's heading toward your team, Dr. Lowell. Got a sighting on one of the sharks. Got you, sir, copy. It turned away, it's in the cove. I'm close to that position. 'Richard, it's too risky, wait for us.' No, Lucas, stay there, I'll bring this one back to the nursery, you can take it. 'I'll say again, wait for us.' - Keep talking to him. - Okay. Watch out, it's still in the cove. 'Richard, that bull is off our grid, you won't see it coming.' Richard, don't go in the cove, it's not safe there we can't see you on the Triton. I'm okay. Just keep your eyes peeled for the other two. 'Richard! Shark! Bull shark!' - Richard? Richard! - Shit! Whoa! - Richard! - Emma! - Quick! Out of the water! - Grab his legs, grab his legs. - You okay? - Lucas. Get the shark out of the water get him on the boat and get it sedated. - Alright. - I'm gonna take this off. - Okay, yeah. Opening your buckles. Yeah, yeah, go. Go. Okay. Well, mesh weaving was worth every penny. Well, good thing the shark was sleeping when it bit you. Very funny. I mean, look on the bright side, right? You'll never have to pay for another drink for the rest of your life. What, you'd buy me a drink? Maybe. Oh, would you listen to me tell you the story about the time a young bull almost bit me in half? But I fought him off all by myself. - Uh-uh. - And then I pried myself free. Tooth by tooth by tooth, I was very brave. Yeah, I'd buy you that drink. But I wouldn't believe a word you said. And one of your men did just get bit in half. Thanks for saving my life out there. You would've done the same. I should get back to my boat. I wanna see that shark. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Snagged. No, no, no, not my lucky hook. Wow, it's beautiful. It's a juvenile. How old do we think it is? Ah, three to four years at most, I'm guessing. Looks older. Nearly mature. What happened to you? How much Haloperidol did you pump into her? I gotta put an IV line in. 30 ccs. But I think she's a he. Nah. Nope, no way. Wow, yeah, no mistaking those claspers for a cloaca. How unprofessional of me. Okay, get him oxygenated, get a sedative line in. And watch his vitals, okay? - Yes, sir. - 'Good job.' I'll go with you tomorrow. I'll help you catch the other two. No, you don't have to do that, Emma. I'm not asking, I'm telling. If you got man-eaters out there, we both need to find out why. 'Bahari!' Wait, Nandi! Bahari! Nandi! Don't go in the water, don't go in the water! Don't go in the water, don't go in the water. Shaw! 'It's okay, Shaw, I got it.' 'Nandi?' 'Oh, my God.' There's still two more out there and we need to find them.. whether your girlfriend helps us or not. You do your job, I'll do mine. Well, you're the one who knows Collins. What do you think she'll do? That's none of your concern. Yet. Spin? Before, did you find anything? Remember that, um, that GPS beacon for Bella the shark they tracked? Here. So... I searched the last GPS tracking beacon frequency sent to the Thasos.. ...then I tapped into their sat network, which just a heads up is not... entirely legal, but... Tell me what I'm looking at. So, I was able to plot the signal's course. Whatever Richard and his team were looking for it was never up any river. - Shit, are you sure? - Uh-huh. That shark's GPS tracking beacon was first activated right... there. Research facility Akheilos, owned by some.. billionaire pharmaceutical guy named Carl Durant. No, wait, I remember this. This was on the news, right? The whole place sank or something? Right, took Durant down with it. I mean, that's weird, right? I wanna know what these assholes are doing with the sharks. Or to them. - Em, I'm so sorry about Bahari. - You lied to me! You didn't track those sharks from the Orange River. They-they escaped from some kind of research facility. How do you know that? Those sharks have been altered engineered, they're not sharks, Richard! - They're something else! - Emma. Emma... What were they doing with them in Akheilos? Lucas! Did you hear that? Wh-what the hell is happening? There's too much force in those hits they're gonna bust the hull straight through the observation window. The lab. The lab! That window's not gonna last much longer. Our sharks are right there, what are you waiting for? Sedate them! Are we gonna let them take this ship down, Richard? No. Charged tips. That's not your decision to make. You have a kill shot, you take it. - 'I'm out of this dump.' - Richard. Come on. They're too deep. I can't get a shot. What the.. Get inside, we're in the line of fire. - Come on, Miya. - Hey! Asshole. If one of those shots hits over here you're gonna take this entire village down. Fuck! Richard? They're here for him. Then give them what they want. I got this. What are you waiting for? Let the shark go. And lose the one live specimen we have forever? Not a chance. Now, give it to me. Back... the fuck... off. What just happened? Your sharks.. ...they understood. Okay, you deserve an explanation... No! No, not another one of your explanations, Richard. The truth! Those two sharks were trying to save their brother. It didn't start with Akheilos, that was second gen work. It started with research on makos trying to acquire proteins to treat Alzheimer's. Right, but they couldn't harvest enough for a trial the makos' brains were too small, so? Were. They genetically engineered them to have larger brains? Along came Carl Durant. Now, he acquired that research with a different goal. If he could increase the intelligence of bulls he could engineer the same treatment for humans. An evolutionary leap. You sound like you believe that. 'They blew up Akheilos to stop' those sharks from escaping. Bella and her pups got out alive. They've been trying to capture and kill them ever since. Explosive lures, poison, never the same way twice. Yeah. Right. Because they're learning. Those are the last of Bella's offspring. The only three left. Genotics Labs bought the patents for treating Alzheimer's and increasing intelligence. Okay, so you're gonna carve up Scarface up there... 'Oh, my God! Just spare me the judgment, Emma.' Now, we can help people, not just talk about it. - Oh. Watch. When I activate Bella's tracker that shark's extremely sensitive neuro-electro reception system, its sixth sense, kicks in. He misses her. When these sharks were born, their-their brains were imprinted with their mother's tracker frequency I mean, it's one of this shit show's happy accidents. Don't. It makes for a powerful, emotional connection. I-I-I used it to draw the bulls to me yesterday and even though that they knew that their mother was dead they couldn't help themselves. Right, so that's why you had Bella's beacon. I-I just.. I can't get close enough to catching them. They're too smart. But they're drawn to this frequency just the same. Emma.. If-if we can study that shark's brain if we can develop the same kind of bond in people imagine how we can change the world to make humanity feel, Emma, and from that... to act. Stop it, just turn it off. Stop. - This is torture. - No, Emma, this is progress. Turn it off, I swear to fucking God you better turn that off, fucking turn it off, Richard! It's off. I'm sorry. But I lied because I knew you would never approve. Well, you're right about one thing then. That is the most valuable animal on the planet and the clock is ticking. These juveniles are maturing faster than we've ever seen before if we fail to capture the other two right here right now, if they mate, I mean, you see what they can do how they can kill. It's the end of the ocean. Everything that we care about. Can't you see that? Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see you knew exactly what we were dealing with and someone I care about is dead. - I don't know what that was. - But I kinda loved it. Shouldn't have told your girl anything. Your damn sharks are smarter than you are. Window's been fixed, you can go. Yeah? You're-you're out here trying to save the world but you don't mind putting everyone else's lives in danger. I said get out, Lucas. Why keep this magic shark lure of yours a secret from us, Richard? Huh? Hey, give it back. Oh, you didn't want Genotics Labs to know? Worried about the ethics here? Or your own future payday when you quit working for Genotics and start your own company? - That's absurd. - Is it? If you hadn't kept this from us, we might've finished our work here a whole lot quicker. What are you gonna do? You're so smart, what do you think? Oh, come on, don't look so surprised. We're not the ones who upgraded a shark, but we are the sorry assholes they sent in to clean up the mess. Two bull sharks attack a 100-foot ship and then back off because they recognized a weapon? That's not real, that... doesn't happen. - You saw it too. - We sure did. - Okay, so what do we do now? - Report it. - Spin? - Yeah, it's gonna be a problem. - Why? - The Internet's down again. Basically everything that I live for... almost everything. - Could it be the satellite? - Uh, yeah. Could be. Okay, hold the fort. Alright, boys. - Time to finish this. - Copy. They're going back in. They have something in that pretty funky-looking metal case. Like, funky in a James Brown way, or.. What do you think? - Is that drone fixed and ready? - Yeah. Let's see what they're up to. - Oh. - Be careful. Thanks. Close, but not too close. Love the range on this baby. What the hell are they doing? Hey, guys, come in here! I've got the drone feed on the Triton. Let's see what they've got in that case. Zoom in. Oh, shit. What do you mean, "Oh, shit"? What does he mean, "Oh, shit"? I gotta find Emma... now. Shit. Dumb idea, Dr. Collins. Emma, where are you? Fuck. Okay, so here's the deal. - They cut the satellite line. - Emma. They got one shark they're gonna carve up and they wanna kill the other two... fast. If those two juvie bulls start making babies... We're talking... seamageddon. - Seamageddon? - Bigger fish to fry, Emma. What? No, this is as big as it gets... Listen to me, that was a mine that they drilled into the nursery wall. For sinking ships. Her dad and I used to employ the same ones in the Gulf. 'They magnetically attach to the hull.' They pack a hell of a punch, believe me. How do they use the mine? Hope that they get lucky that those two bull sharks happen to swim by? Geography. The nursery is in a trench, a canyon enclosed by two walls. The shockwave from that mine will bounce between the walls back and forth creating a fucking blender from hell. 'The kinetic energy in that canyon will destroy everything.' 'The shockwave will then funnel up' creating a massive wave, a mini tsunami. It'll hit Little Happy with full force, point-blank and take the entire village down. And us with it. The only safe place for miles will be their goddamn boat. - I need to talk to Richard. - It won't make a difference. - Emma! - Shaw. Stay put. I mean it. Were you gonna warn us? Or were you just gonna let us drown? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about the mine. Emma.. What mine? The one you put in the nursery. Do you seriously think I'm supposed to believe you didn't know anything about it, Richard? 'Or about cutting the satellite com line?' I swear I don't know what you're talking about. Lucas. Hey. - What did you do? - I followed orders. Find Bella, capture or kill her offspring before they can breed which could be pretty much any time now. They'll probably have fucking hands by then. So I'm choosing "kill." Lucas, our orders didn't include blowing anything up or murdering anybody. Well, you really think that they sent us here to develop drugs for slow kids? Or what? So-so they can get As and learn to play the oboe on their way to Harvard? Genotics Labs didn't send us here to benefit mankind you dumb shit! They're just covering their asses protecting their patents, their stock price. Because the people-the people who control everything now man, they will pay anything so their kids can control everything when all this starts to turn to shit. "Here you go, kid, here's a billion dollars and 40 IQ points." See, it's all about survival, folks. Get inside. And survival's all about the money. Get inside! Go now! - Take cover! - 'Shaw!' Not everyone gets to be a shark. - Wait, no! - Go! Go! Go! Faster, Spin! - No! Shaw, watch out! - Shaw! - Shaw! - No, no! Get down! - Lucas! - Stop! What the hell are you doing? What I'm paid to do. Clean up the mess. Fuck! We need to get higher. No! Stop! Stop! Let go! Emma! Stop! No! - Emma, run! Take care of that, Schill! 'Where are our fucking Einsteins when you fucking need them?' - No, no. We gotta get out! - No! No! Spin! Spin! Spin! There are sharks out there! Miya! Spin! - Shaw! - Shaw! Shark! Stay inside! I'll get you out! - Shaw. - Emma. Shaw. Are you alright? You good? - Yeah. - Okay. - Miya. Spin? - Inside. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, I can... - Emma, don't press your luck. The shark's right under there. If we don't defuse that mine, none of us will make it. The moment they get that ship to a safe distance they'll detonate it. Look, you get Miya and Spin, I'll get the mine. No, you swim like a walrus, I dive. - Fine, whatever. - When I find it, what do I do? Get your ass back here, fast. I'll figure out a way to defuse it. - Go. - Okay. Careful, Shaw! Be careful! - Miya. - Shaw! - Spin! - Shaw! - Shaw! - Shaw! Shaw! You know what to do. Done. Lucas, whatever you're thinking about doing, just stop, please! You have a choice to make, boss. Stay on the ship and collect your check or you can join your grad school crush. Should be a no-brainer, Richard. You know, these sharks are more human than you are now. 'At least they care enough to try and get their brother back.' What do you care about, Lucas? Getting out and getting paid. You're right. It is a no-brainer. No. I would rather die with her than live like you. Shark lover, eh? Look at me. Dive. Just dive. Take it. Breathe. You got this. Yeah. Little tour before we go. We'll go around the back. Just you stay here, and, uh... Wait, stay here? You stay here. No, we need to see if one of those things is out there. - Okay. - Spin. I'll be right back, okay? - Spin. Promise me. - I promise. - Promise promise? - Promise promise. Shit. Hey, neighbor. Fuck. Come on, man. You ain't gotta do this. Come on, old man. Let's see what you got. What'd you say? I left my hearing aide inside. Why don't you come a little closer, sonny? - Sonny? - 'Yeah, that's right.' Yeah. - Come on, bitch. - Yeah. You promised. - Ah! - Shh, shh, shh. One of them's right out there. - Okay? We gotta hide. - Hide? - Now. - Hide where? Oh, shit! Holy shit! Go upstairs! Go, go, go! Here, come on! Shit, shit, shit. I was expecting more from you, old man! That was way too easy. Now, come on. Get up. Get up! Fuck. The beacon. Miya, I gotta tell you something, 'cause if I don't.. All my life, I've been, like, afraid, of everything. And-and, and then I met you. And you make me less afraid. And I love that. And I love that-that you laugh at my jokes even though they're not funny. And I love that you make fun of me when I say stupid stuff, which is, like, all the time. And... I just love how you make me feel. And, uh, when we get out of this and we will get out of this, I promise when we do.. I'd really like to hang out with you some more. It's okay. - Oh. Spin. - Holy shit! There is blood. It's everywhere. That was close. Earl! Finish this piece of shit. Then get back to the ship. Come on! - No! - Fuck! No, no, no! Not a coffin, not a coffin. Not a coffin, not a coffin. Not a coffin. Not a coffin. Not a coffin, not a coffin. - Ah! - Miya! Argh! No! No! No! No! Oh, Sally. Schill, you finish her yet? Schill. 'Shaw, can you hear me? Shaw?' - Emma? - 'Where are you? Come in.' - Emma! - 'Shaw? Oh, God, Shaw.' 'Listen to me. I need your help.' Emma, those bulls are right on top of you. Yeah, no shit. I have the mine. And these two bulls know what it is. What do you mean? 'Richard said they used explosives' on those sharks before. I think I can get back. Shaw! The Thasos, it's about to leave! Emma, Lucas is about to go, he can blow the mine at any moment, you need to disarm it. 'I'm in the cove, these bulls on my ass, ' 'can you get 'em off me?' Stand by. Grab his legs. - Sorry, chum. Thanks, Shaw. And so sorry. - Sorry? Sorry about what, Emma? - 'Something I gotta do.' - What? - 'You won't like it. Bye.' Bye? No, not bye. What do you mean, "Bye"? Emma! Emma, Lucas is leaving. Emma! God. Miss me? Sharks got them. Lucas. In his hand, he's got the detonator. Where's the mine? Little Happy.. ...meet Big Unhappy. Let's get out of here. We can all agree on that, right? - We'll take my boat. - Alright. I'll get some freshwater, some supplies. Emma? I can't leave. What are you talking about? I'm not asking either one of you to stay, but I can't go, not until it's over. It is goddamn over. We're alive, guys. So are those bulls. Richard and that asshole Lucas were right. If those things mate.. ...we don't know what they could become. They're right? What are you talking about? You spent your entire life trying to save sharks. I know, but.. - But what? - This is bigger than us. Not our responsibility, ladies. Well, if it's not our responsibility, Shaw, whose? We're the only ones on Earth who can stop them... right now. We're not gonna get another chance. My dad never backed away from a fight. He just fought harder. What about you? You gotta be fucking kidding me, Emma. So how will you find these monsters? Exactly. They're gone, they could be miles away by now. They're not monsters, we did this to them. - Shark's GPS beacon. - Not just any shark. Bella. Their mother. They sense this every day of their lives. Richard told me that their brains even imprinted on this specific frequency, they followed it like instinct I saw it myself. Alright? To these bulls... this beacon is their mother. I don't get it. I'm not going after them. I'm gonna get them to come back. - This is all we got. - Not all. I'm gonna attach this to the drone bring them into the cove, right past your house and past here, and around and around until we kill them. - For Bahari. - For Miya and Spin. For all of us. Okay, I'm coming around. 'Okay, I'm going right.' 'Going around.' I see them! - I got 'em. - Reel 'em in. - 'Bring 'em in close.' - Alright. There you go. Ride 'em in, that's it. 'Emma!' Shit, they're losing interest. - What's going on? - Fuck. I don't.. It's stuck on something. What do you mean, "it's stuck"? - I gotta cut it loose. - Let me see. Look. We'll never catch them if we don't. - Not a chance, I got this. - Shaw, wait! Shaw! Shaw. You're almost there! You see 'em? Shaw. Yes. Yes! Come on in. Shaw, come on! - Shaw! Get out! Get out! Shaw! - Shaw! - Shaw! Shaw! - Shaw! Get out of the water! - Fuck, Shaw! - Shaw! Shaw, get out of the water! Get out of the water! - Shaw! Get out! - 'Shaw!' - Shaw! Shaw! Shaw! Shaw! Shaw! Where are you going, bitch? Huh? Where are you going? You're not going anywhere. Where are you going? - Argh! - You got nowhere to run. You little shit! Too easy! Come on! Come on! Drown, bitch! Hey, asshole! Argh! That the best you got? You stupid bitch. Emma, no. Hey! Come here! - Come here! - Shit! - Fuck, Emma. Come on! Come on! Fuck! Oh. I'm so sorry. - No! Emma. You're crazy, you know that? It was a beautiful place. 'Sally.' Emma. It's ours. You're not a shark. Oh, my God, come here. Miya. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Come, sit here, you'll be alright. What happened? Where to, Ems? How do you guys feel about civilization? - I'd love to give it a try. - Me too. - Let's do it. - You're stuck with us now. I hope so. Planet's not gonna save itself.
