Uncle is calling you How's everyone at home? -What is this? Hey, what is this? You have really grown up Aravind... New dress? It's great (Laughs) Stubborn kid! Standing naked infront of everyone shamelessly... Why don't you wear something? You are as lazy as your dad Shut up! Shut up! I said shut up Aravind's father, right? Yes Your son answers theory questions really well Well... But in the objective paper... He is submitting it empty What? That's what. Look at the science paper 90 above... Science objective... Zero... Maths paper... He returned it empty We don't understand anything What is this? When you could answer essays well what's the problem with objectives? Don't know, dad When I look at options, I get confused I don't know what to decide on With that one word, I could see my future clearly (MENTAL MADHILO) Post that, I immediately got him into a yoga class Greetings, sir -Greetings My son... Double minded... He cannot decide on anything Whomever we asked suggested yoga to get better Well said! Me? Not you Then? Whoever told you was right Oh... True... Will he come in the mornings or evenings? Morning or evening? What do you say? That's his condition Will you be joining him too? Sir, the kid is double minded Not me Just teach him some postures Not postures... Meditation... Teach him something. What do I know? (Laughter) What happened next? What could it be? He practiced yoga for 2 years One fine morning, he came to me and said "Dad, I am not going to yoga from today" First time he made a decision in his life... I was relieved about it But, he brought along another problem with it What's that? Girls... Hi... Sushma... You are...? Which school? Which school? Hey Aravind... Sushma, you should also top in college like her Okay, uncle. Hi, Aravind... Off to college? Actually, I got 90 due to lack of preparation Hi, Aravind Heard you got a job. -Yeah Congrats!

Jadeja and I are getting married Congrats, Jadeja -Thank you For the struggles I faced to get him educated and employed I should be awarded with Khel Ratna Marriage might get him settled Tried that too What's your son's name? -Aravind Krishna Aravind Krishna... Age? -27 Are you okay? I am sorry. Do you have any problem? I dont like you at all Why are you staring at me like that? Sorry. I already have a boyfriend Aravind Krishna, right? Yes What's his age now? No more, mom. I am done -One last dosa! Come on! I am talking about the wedding matches not dosas We just looked at 12 for you You know how many your dad had been to? 32... Want me to surpass him on that or what? One would apply 10 days leave for wedding I applied just to look for wedding matches. Crap! I am tired of it Don't worry. This match will be fixed Hello... It's alright Alright. I won't mind Used to it What happened, dear? Aravind Krishna, 29... Am I right? Why do you have to renew every year? Instead, you could go for the 5 year membership card That's best for you Nowadays it's tough for boys to be liked by girls But because of him, we have to let go of those matches too One minute he likes her and the next he doesn't Because of this, even our friends are not talking to me We all used to go to the movies as a gang I now watch TV alone at home Hey... Come... Come... Come... How come you are so early? My daughter... Have you recognized him? Prasad uncle... How are you, uncle? -I am good How are you? -I am doing good I will just come Okay What is she doing? Done with M.S. Working right now Can she be a match for my... No... No... Don't get me wrong but she is in love with someone Love marriage? Very good. Very good You didn't mind, right? -Not at all Hey, do you remember? We earlier thought that after our kids grow up we would let them marry their love When my son was born, I thought He should fall in love with a girl She should give him a tight slap But he should still get her to marry him I imagined a lot Does it all happen? Now it's hard to get him married Relax... By the way... I have a friend named Murthy He is looking for matches for his daughter Very nice family... Her name... I think it's Swetcha You just say yes I will arrange for you to meet them (Old song playing) This is stuck Hey, don't have that gloomy face while going out You should've gotten me into an acting school I would show the expressions you like Do you know how old you are? 29... which is a 2 and a 9 If you wait for another four months that 2 digit will disappear Dear, I look good, right? Other than your hurry there is nothing else here Is this their flat? -You expect them to lay a red carpet for you? They should I am very particular about such things. You too know -No. Your phone... What? -Phone... Phone... Mr. Murthy... We have reached. We are at the basement Is it? Come up, Sir. 403... Okay, Sir What, dear? -He wants us to come up No proper reception Have we come for lunch?

I can't cover up anymore. Talk... Uncle... -Yeah? Where's the restroom? Go straight and take right Okay. 2 minutes... You guys talk. I will be back What else? I love cricket just like you -Superb! We used to play a lot -Oh She is waiting outside -It's alright He is suggesting you to go out, you fool! Go... That way... Hey... Hi... Swetcha, right? -Yeah Nice name Someone forgot his bike helmet Yeah. Right Own house or on rent? Own... Why? Just for the sake of asking I mean... Yeah? Nothing. Nothing Oh... I mean... I can't manage to talk to girls much I get that Oh... You could understand! But I can't understand anything But, I somehow want to talk to you Okay. What are your comfortable topics? Cinema... Sports... Politics... Don't give me too many options Why? That's just it Oh... Don't you really talk to girls at all? In the third grade, I asked a girl for pencil... -But, why so? Because...That's just it I've been to many wedding matches but never spoke to the girl I mean... Like this... Too many people and their silk sarees... Looking at their arrangements, I would panic Your family is really simple Arrangements are fine for the wedding It's unnecessary for this That is what I mean Can I ask you something? Because... I didn't even talk to anyone else You don't have to explain Go ahead I mean... How do I talk to girls without any fear? How do I manage to not show them I am uncomfortable? Even if this match doesn't work out, it will be helpful for the next Please advise me as a friend Okay You shouldn't tap foot like that Or smile unnecessarily like this If you really have to smile, you shouldn't control So, are you comfortable now? As you are thinking about another match does it mean you aren't okay with this one? Can I take it like that? No... No... No... Not at all... I asked as I might not get the chance again Okay As you called me a friend my suggestion is stop thinking negatively Sorry. I find it difficult to address you respectfully I will address you singularly Okay? Not okay I think it won't work out We have five resourcers in Mumbai Yes, sir -Three in Chennai You better go to Chennai Okay, sir Because, there are more complaints in Chennai In Mumbai... work load is more Will you go to Mumbai? -Yes No... No... No... No... Okay. You tell me. Mumbai or Chennai? Tell me. You will give the training there Sir... Look, he is back Hey, what was it? I thought I was different but everyone is like me Is he the manager or am I? He asks if I would go to Mumbai or Chennai like I am on a bus He might like you What happened yesterday? Aravind... I forgot to add the job in yesterday's report Can you please have a look? -Yeah... Yeah... She left What happeend yesterday? (Telephone ringing) Hello...

Call after 2 months Sambasivarao it seems Call back later By the way... What do you think, dad? I think it's better if you go to the office Not about that I feel I will pass the exam this time What's the hurry? Let the results be out Dear... Mom, don't bother with the horoscopes this time Let things happen Leave that He might ask for dowry on the phone itself. Tell him first What? We decided last night on not taking dowry There are some procedures They might send her with something Would we say no? No. I will not accept dowry at all -Who asked you to? I will take it Mom gave you, didn't she? My dad took that Your dad takes what you are given Do you even know the wedding expenses? Who will pay for it all? We can discuss when the time comes Whatever it is, I don't approve of dowry Get lost then Dad... Dad... I finally liked a girl Why the dowry? If I go to U.S twice I will earn as much Don't look at me like that I really like her I swear... (Telephone ringing) Hello... Yeah... Alright... Okay What did you two talk about? She said yes Why are you so shocked? I didn't believe it too But that is what they said They want to arrange the engagement soon Heart might have gotten wings It might fly away It might hold you Just like the breeze An answer might then come Reaching out to me It's a wonder Beyond my imagination I don't belong to myself anymore I am a bird looking for a companion Breaking free from the cage With a shimmer of hope Shall I send you my letters of love?

When I like you why do I have to look for another match? Correct... But, why so? Don't I know what I want? Hello... Aravind Krishna... What are you thinking about? My dad is really cool He doesn't bother much To balance that, my mom is a little strict... My grandma is of the next level Need not tell. I can see that Is this okay? If she knows we are roaming before the engagement my grandma would have a heart attack Both mom and dad are really cool You are really lucky in their case My dad... Hello, dad... Where are you?

Take them Choose one Which one's nice? Usually... If I am given options... I get confused I don't know what to decide on I go blank Okay What okay? Have you even heard? What now? Do I say 'Oh shit! Is it?' Don't worry. Why do you think it's a huge problem? Everyone has it They just manage with a spoon of confidence Why are you smirking? I am not saying it to console you It's true -True... Okay. I agree. Why are you pinching me? Hey, are you crazy? It really hurts Now tell me. -What do I say? I first scratched and then pinched Which hurts more? Do you want me to scratch or pinch again? You just have two options Scratch... -See...You are deciding Do you never get confused? Am I not human? I get confused too but I think slowly and decide Just like I selected this dress If they are life-changing decisions I go to my grandma's place I feel so peaceful there But... Once decided... It's done That's all Pinch me now Scratch... Look... My problem starts here Sometimes, I get confused even after deciding Shall we try again? Okay. Bye... Was there any doubt? Don't worry. Yeah...

With that, I joined in a boys school Due to fear, you made the first decision in your life Good But you spoke well with me the first time That is what I still don't get You know something... Girls actually enjoy when someone looks at them That doesn't mean you stare Like you did... You should casually take a glance Do this from today Look straight in the eye and talk confidently with any girl Only in the eye in case you deviate, look around Take some time Look into her eyes again.

You struck gold Where does this journey lead? ------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- Looks like the wedding will be in this flat Seems they are greedy like your maternal side When I expected a red carpet welcome They laid gunny mats No respect... -Dad...

It's alright There is 2-3 months time We can have the engagement and wedding consecutively We too will have a word with the priest As there is time We wanted to show their horoscopes to someone we know I mean... We could recheck their compatability Pre-engagement photo shoots Last day of bachelor lives... We planned it crazily But your grandma... Planned it right on our engagement day Don't say that What did I say? Would be nice if she was there I just expressed it differently By the way What does your family think of me? Shall I say the truth? They feel my grandma is dead because of you Weird! Not considering her age they are blaming me Great family... As you would say this we are also prepared What? Soon after your match was fixed my uncle had heart surgery Our distant relatives got chikun guinea Everything is because of you If you attack us We will do too In case our horoscopes don't match if we only have 18 points out of 36 Aren't half the points enough for us to be happy? Enough for us Our families want distinction What to do then? What do I know? There are some alternatives 18 points hike to 30 with that If they don't match even then? Watch the movie I am scared, Aru It happened right on the day of engagement Everyone is raising weird doubts What's going to happen? I feel like running far away from all this What? I said it casually Seriously? Come on. Let's go -Why are you late? Did they doubt you? -Why would they? I am going to my friend's wedding 3 days. You?

I can't see anything One... We have to reach the pole in 30 seconds Two... Three... Why didn't I meet you earlier? I should have been married by now My problem is, since childhood, I easily get used to everything I am easily attached to anything But nothing happens as I want it to Anything close to me doesn't stay with me But I moved along with a tiny hope But Rahul... I convinced everyone at home Th wedding was in 3 months and Accident... I didn't understand anything I felt everything shattered at once Didn't speak with anyone for 2 months My parents were worried about me I will weaken emotionally if I stay home So, I just said The moment I feel I am strong I will return home But my mom fears I might hurt myself That is why she calls daily I cut the call assuring I am alive I want to talk but if I do I will break down She will cry because of me I feel like returning immediately But without me knowing Hope rose in my life again Because of you I know you have Swetcha and you will be engaged. But still I don't know I feel I am too attached to you I feel I want you forever I know this is wrong But it just happened I don't want to regret not telling you this I said it You don't have to reply I don't want it too I will assume you rejecetd me It's over Forget this I am hungry Let's move? Aravind, these fluctuations are common Don't think crazily What's crazy in this? Bro likes Renu. What's wrong in that? What's wrong? Is she a fool to wait there? Will he spoil his life for her? Hello... Hello, Mano... Hi, Swetcha. Tell me Don't tell him I am coming It should be a surprise to Aru Okay Okay. Bye... -Bye... I don't understand why you are so confused Think like this If your engagement wasn't fixed If Swetcha wasn't in your life Won't you accept Renu? She's a very practical girl, bro Maybe this is why your engagement was cancelled the first time I think something better is waiting for you It's not too late, bro Think about it Hello... Yes, Mr. Purushotham Where are you? Home. Tell me. Done with fooding? Yes What's that train sound? Hello... -Hello... Hello, Aru... Can you hear me? Yeah Tell me Swetcha... I... -What happened? Shall we cancel our engagement? What? Sorry. Bye... Hello, Swetcha I was just playing a prank Reception went off right then I meant we will get married straight away Are you out of your mind? Do you joke about such stuff? Sorry... What's that sound? Nothing. I will call you back. Bye -Swetcha... You aren't angry, right? -No. Bye Did he make you wait? -No. Just 5 minutes Coffee? -No. Thanks. Tea? - (sarcastically) Looks like you want it. Shall I make? (hesitatingly) No. Nothing like that You want coffee? -You always talk about coffee How come you are here? Didn't even tell Why should I tell you? Surprise... How did you come here? You don't know that we became friends. Mano came Nice room... Where is she? Renu... -She went out Out of town... -Yeah. Out of town Nice... Renu? Very cute She should've been here Why did she leave suddenly? Had some work... I wanted to ask you something Did you miss me? A lot The truth... No, right? -A bit Why are you thinking so much? Good friends... Superb ambience... How would you miss? There's nothing wrong in it What did you say at home? Actually, something is weird Yellow and violet should've been interchanged, right? You must be thinking... He came first Then a girl with him And now, me... He must be getting kids next Our neighbor aunt must be upset We just started feeling it as a home It was a lodge with us two Only to sleep in and freshen up What else do you want to do? Hey... Look at her. Looks like Renu That is Renu You said she is out of town We are wondering the same -Wait. One minute Hi... -Hello... Excuse me. Sorry. Do I know you? Swetcha... -Yes Oh my God! Hi... Nice... Very nice... Sir, just one minute. I will be back -Carry on When did you come? Morning. They said you are out of town Yeah Okay. Actually, I came this morning I was at my friend's Didn't know you were coming Looks like she will bring her home Yeah... This... Show... We should have a scotch bottle now Been so long We can't get it now Been so long? We drank like pigs at the wedding Renu, will you help me with shopping tomorrow? You don't have to ask. Just call me I seriosuly did not expect this from you, Aru How can you do that? I am sorry Sorry? Do you know how it hurts? Yelling doesn't suit me, right? You met your friends after a long time Enjoy... It's okay Just tell me. Simple... I don't understand anything It's all confusing To be true, I feel very guilty It's clear. Do one thing Go and tell Swetcha about Renu As she is cool, see how she reacts I too feel that's correct Correct If she reacts positively or negatively, remaining option is Renu. No confusion If she meets another girl after Renu Look... As you feel guilty, better let it out It's quite common Hope Swetcha understands Tell her Whatever it is, tell her Attend the engagement I will invite personally Bye... Bye... Your dress... That's okay. Send it with Aru. Bye Swetcha... I have to tell you something Tell me Bro, been trying your phone Did Renu call you? If you love Renu, loving Swetcha is a lie If you love Swetcha, loving Renu is a lie One of the two There's a chance of both being a lie but both can't be true Any misunderstanding between you two? That is why you shouldn't meet often before marriage If you meet often you will get to know more If you get to know more you will have more problems The commitment to overcome those problems Very few have it If you get to know after marriage Good or bad... We will adjust Later, you will get used to it Because... Marriage is a huge commitment I don't know what happened between you two But it's upto you If you don't want it don't think about anyone You are important to us Everyone else comes next Okay? Mom, can you get me coffee? My head hurts Why did you come all of a sudden? Is the work over? Or did they chase you off? Hey... What happened? What do you want to do? Your mom had two miscarriages before you She became too weak When you were in the womb she had labor pains in the 7th month B.P hiked and she got fits Situation was out of control Doctors couldn't even operate on her They said only one of you can be saved I didn't understand anything in that moment Do I loose this kid? Or your mom? Both were difficult choices If I kept thinking like you I would loose both of you I said I want your mom And got you as a gift More than what we might get from making a decision Think about what we might loose Decision then has a value Swetcha... 2 minutes... I have to talk to you Swetcha, please... 2 minutes... Swetcha, please... Yeah. Tell me, Aravind I made a mistake I shouldn't have done it It happened in a weak moment -So? What do you want me to do now? What do you mean? I am asking you to understand Okay. I understand. Can I leave now? -Swetcha, please... Please give me one chance How do I look, huh? Just an option? That or this... No one wishes to be an option in other's life, Aravind You inclined towards someone in just a month in Mumbai After we get married, you will go on-set. What then? Do you want a relation only if the person's near? If the person's far away you will immediately have other options Later, wherever you go fearing you will leave with someone do I have to be insecure throughout my life? I am sorry, Swetcha It's my fault But give me one chance -Oh Chance, right? Okay. Done I will look at 10 to 20 other people If I don't like anyone and have no other option, we will see Wait until then if you can Or look for another option like always Hi... Why are you here? Why am I here? Don't know. Just came Tea or Coffee? Have tea. The tea here is yum Brother, one more tea. Actually, two please I... I forgot to tell you I met our neighbor aunty at the market -Renu, please... Okay. Tell me Come on. Tell me It's a good decision, Aravind I said, it's a good decision I am sorry Our relationship is like I have to apologize if you do If you thank me I should thank you too You know what Everything happens for a reason Sorry... Thanks... Above all this is Destiny I forgot Give this to Swetcha Okay. it's time. I have got to go Where are you going? I shouldn't tell. Secret... Aravind... Bye... Any meeting starts with a Hi and ends with a Bye Ours wasn't like that It started with a Hi and was cut midway So, if I meet her and say Bye, I can be peaceful Bye... Hey, what happened? She left the city. Her dad called Is it? What else did he say? Nothing else but he sounded very dull Didn't she tell you she was leaving? Did he say about cancelling engagement and wedding? Cancellation? What did you do to her? -Dad, come with me Wait. I will take a shower -Come on I will look real bad with this lungi There are things much more important than your lungi , come... By the way did they mention the place where she is going? I don't know..while I was on call , Yusuf Pathan had just hit a six seeing that , i forgot this Yesterday you were telling serious dialogues and all Today how come you are so irresponsible dad? Get on... Do you really want me to come this way? Get on dad, it's okay... What will I do all alone? If you are there it will be good You say this is good? Let's go Brother-in-law, what is this? I came for a haircut in the next lane He said he would dye my hair I came to visit you meanwhile Please come in Aunty, where's Swetcha? Shw went to Vizag To her grandma's place Vizag? Didn't she tell you? -She did Look, I know you two had a small disturbance If I ask her, she is giving me silly reasons What actually happened between you two? Because of you, aunty Because of me? -Yeah She came to Mumbai I asked her not to tell you that We fought over that What? When did Swetcha go to Mumbai? Doesn't she know? I feel really mad, aunty Don't know what I am talking I will come back. When is the bus? 9:15 at this bus stop... Aravind... Remember one thing Life gives you many problems Aunty, I don't have time I will come back and listen. Dad... Stop. Where to? Seats are filled You can't even get down Sit... Please... Listen to me once I made a mistake I got confused about something I shouldn't be You asked me to count to ten before deciding But I counted to 100 I still can't go the other way Maybe, this is commitment I am beginning to understand I am thinking stable, Swetcha This won't repeat again Sir, cool or normal? Normal water -Here... Ma'am? -Normal for her too Look, I am deciding for you too Swetcha, please... I realised my mistake before the wedding and corrected it We will have no issues post wedding I forgot to tell you I told your mom you came to Mumbai Have you lost your mind? Why did you tell her? What will she think of me? I don't know. It just came out You are such a waste fellow Yell... Go on... But you said we learn from our mistakes I understand now Choose one -What's this? To accept you or not? I will not choose Why? -Because... No one wants to be an option in other's life, Swetcha Did I say it right? I know this is what you expected When did your parents last hit you? My mom did since childhood Why do you ask? Remember this -What? Hey... My dad... Sir, is he really your son? Then why are you laughing when she slapped him? You must attend my son's wedding without fail I will come...but Your night dress is very good
