(epic music) (electric buzz) - Revenge is best served cold. How long has it been since I felt the warmth of the sun? Trapped here on this dying planet, no conquest, no terrified screams, no fun. It has been too long. Chamberlain! - You called, my lord? - Tell me of your progress for getting us off this rock. - Everything is ready, my lord. Your agent, the warrior beast Kraa, is ready for transport. - What target have you chosen? - A small planet in the Omega Sector called Earth. - Earth, yes, the warm planet. - Yes, my lord, its conquest should be a simple matter. The most powerful weapons are merely atomic, no match for us, I mean, you. You need only give the word and it'll be done. - The word is given, take this planet for us. - There is one faction that might pose a problem to us. The Planet Patrol. - Ready the interspace barrage. Even if they are not destroyed outright, they will be unable to interfere with our conquest of Earth. - As you command, my lord. - Let nothing stop us in our quest for warmth. - Welcome aboard, Curtis. So, this is your first assignment. - Yes, sir. - I want to take this opportunity to introduce you to the other members of our team. Lieutenant Able, our engineer. - Hey, kid. - Patrolman Garth. - What's up? - This is a remote outpost, Curtis, and things are usually pretty quiet around here. But that doesn't mean we take our responsibilities for granted. - No, sir. - According to your file, you're designated as a double-P specialist? - Yes, sir. - Curtis, what is a double-P specialist? - Psychic powers, sir. - Psychic powers. - Yes, sir, telepathy, telekinesis, quantum manipulation, mind control. - And you can do all that? - Sometimes, I'm afraid it's not all that reliable. - Tell me what I'm thinking right now. - That you don't believe I have any psychic powers. - Ah, too easy. - Well, Curtis, around here, we're gonna be based pretty much on traditional police work, the reliable kind. - Yes sir. - This is just one of over 2000 stations in the galaxy. Planet Patrol was created to monitor and protect the cosmos from tyrannical threats. We are the first and last line of defense. Fortunately for us, nothing bad has happened in a long time. - (alarm blaring) Official alert, unauthorized transport, unauthorized transport. Official alert, unauthorized transport. - Where? - Approaching Planet 3, Sun 97. - Is that inhabited? - Yeah, planet Earth, class five industrial civilization. I don't like the look of this. See, it just dropped into view, that means it was teleported. - What's the size? - BASE? - 87 thousand metric tons, Lieutenant Able. - I'd call that big. - And it's entering Earth's atmosphere. (dramatic music) (water splashes) (Kraa roars) There he is. - He's huge. - Can we identify him? - Kraa, a planet wrecker for hire. Not too smart, but he's as tough as they come. - Who sent him, where'd he come from? - You're supposed to be the psychic, you tell us. - Run a teleport trace. - It'll take time. - It's a cold planet. - What's that? - It's a cold planet in orbit around a burned-out sun. There are people there, but they're buried deep, close to the core. But their planet's losing its warmth, it's-- - The Dark Planet. - The Dark Planet. - They're cold, they're nasty, and they've got no sense of humor. - Looks like Lord Doom is trying to heat things up again. But I guess we shouldn't be surprised. Curtis, looks like you're going out on your first patrol. You and Garth get your gear, get ready to go to Earth. You've got a monster to fight. - All right, bout time we got some action around here. Let's go, Curtis. - [BASE] Alert, alert, we are under attack. Danger, danger. (pulse cannon explodes) - My lord, the pulse cannons have been fired. The Planet Patrol has been neutralized. - Good, that should keep those little brats occupied while Kraa secures Earth for us. (dramatic music) (alarm blaring) - You okay? - Able, status report. - Hold on. BASE, status. BASE, reset and respond. C'mon, BASE, wake up. BASE is down. - Do it the old fashioned way. - Manual systems check. Main power's down, we're runnin' on auxiliary. That means teleportation is shot, and no way to contact main headquarters. - Then we're on our own. - That's not the worst news. Whatever hit us destabilized the core. With auxiliary power at maximum, I might just be able to keep us from going critical, but if we can't make repairs-- - We'll blow up like a supernova. - Right. First things first, there's still a situation on Earth that needs dealing with. - But we can't get off base until main power's restored. - Earth can't wait that long. We'll have to send somebody else. Who do we have in the reserves? - [Able] Checking. Not good, the only agent we have in range is Mogyar, but he's on a scouting mission. He's got no supplies, no backup, and no weapons capable of stopping Kraa. - He's an officer of the Planet Patrol. He'll have to do, contact him. - Right. - We'll just have to help that he can find assistance from the locals. (light airy music) (dog barking) - Oh, sorry, grill's closed. - Yeah? - I'm gettin' ready to lock up, okay? - Yeah, so are you open are you closed? Look, can I get a cup of tea? I mean, unless you're closed. - Not for tea. - Decaf. - Regular ol' tea in a bag is what I got. - Fine. - You one o' them tea-drinkin' bikers or somethin'? (gentle music) - You hear somethin'? - Like what? - Sort of a high-pitched harmonic? - Uh uh. - Oh no. I have very good ears, there's somethin' there. Wasn't there a few seconds ago. - Look, man, I don't hear no-- (whistling) - Now you hear it. - What is that? - I think it's an aircraft. Don't see any running lights. - I ain't never heard no airplane make a sound like that. - Nah, neither have I, I think we better get out of here. (crash) - Don't move. - Get your hands off of me. - I'm checkin' you for injuries. - Are you a doctor? - I took a couple years of med school. - Yeah? Well, go back and graduate before you start lookin' for some spinal stuff comin' out of my nose. - Pretty smashed up, huh? - What the hell happened? Somebody drop it out of a plane or somethin'? - No, just don't touch it. - Why not? - Cause I don't think it's a satellite. This thing was designed for re-entry, it has some sort of a attachment for a parachute or somethin'. Either way, there's no way this thing should be in one piece after the way it crashed into the ground. We don't build our satellites that tough. - And how would you know that? - I did some work as an intern on the Voyager team back when I was a grad student. - What are you? Are you some kind of big brain or somethin'? - Yeah, big brain, big hair, big gut, big everything. Well, it's cool now. - So you think it's some kind of outer space thing? Like a UFO? - Boy that'd be somethin', wouldn't it? And for once, it's not out in the middle of a desert somewhere. Government's not gonna get its hands on this baby, no sir. (speaking in Italian) - There's definitely signs of damage. One of the windows is cracked. No movement detected. There's a Closed sign posted on the door. Negative. No objects visible from here. There's signs of, uh, explosion or impact. - Roger that, move out. (dramatic music) - Ames, Henderson, secure the roof. Bell, check the freezer. Command, we have an object, non-biological. (doorbell buzzes) - Who is it? - [Biker] Bobby. - Get up here. (speaking Italian) - Box, get in the box, uh! (knocks on door) - Get in here. I swear, it's like having some type of giant Italian creepy-crawler livin' in your apartment. - Did you try to communicate with him? - Huh, oh yeah, we were having a little chat. (speaking Italian) - Okay, okay, calm down, calm down, we're not gonna hurt you. Look, I brought some language books, we're gonna learn how to speak to one another. And I got a world atlas. (speaking Italian) - Well, I guess he can read, fast too. - Oh maybe he's just lookin' at the pictures. - It's empty, sir, we were too late. - Wheeler, give me the time of impact. - 11:51 PM, local time. Maybe they were closed, maybe not. - All right, who owns this place? - Alma James, 3025 North Avenue. - I am constantly impressed by your efficiency, gentlemen. - [Alien] Where is here, anyway? - [Bobby] New Jersey. - That's, uh, that's nowhere near Napoli, right? - Huh, no. Lemme show you, uh, okay, New Jersey is all the way here, in the United States, and Naples is way over here somewhere in Italy. - This could be a bad problem. - Why you wanna get to Naples? - Well, it's a pretty long story. I guess you want to hear it, huh? - So, uh, do you have a name? - Of course I have a name. How else would people know what to call me? Mogyar. - Well I'm Bobby Macek, and this is, uh. - Alma James, pleasure. - Pleased to meet you, so, listen up. I'm what you might call an interstellar policeman. I'm here to apprehend an alien lifeform. A very dangerous being known as Kraa. And he's big, too, around 200 feet tall. You see, there's an interstellar pirate named Lord Doom, and he sent Kraa to destroy the earth. Not the whole planet, just your civilizations. That's what Kraa does, like for a living. He goes around destroying planets. If we don't stop him, then Doom will take over your planet for himself. That's why I'm here, that's why I need your help. - A 200 foot tall alien has landed on Earth? - Not, uh, on the land, I mean on the planet Earth. But he'd come down in the ocean because he's like me, he's a semi-aquatic. - So with all the oceans in the world to hide in, how you gonna find him? - Oh, I don't think that's-a gonna be a big problem. Only trouble is, I don't got no weapons. So, I monitor your data transmissions, and I find out that this place, the Atomic Fission Institute in Napoli, they have a new research project. They gonna have the components I need to build a new weapon that can destroy Kraa, that's why I was going to Napoli. (crash) (yelling) - Wait, I mean you no harm. - Hey, ain't you guys ever heard of the Constitution? (overlapping yelling) - Uh uh, hey I come in peace, okay? - Bio-containment on the double. - [Mogyar] Hey I'm here to help you, okay? - He's speakin' with an Italian accent. - Shut up, don't listen to him. (breathing) - Uh oh. (speaking Italian) - Sir. - Excellent work, men, well done Rick. - Thank you, sir. - Good job on the door, too. All right, clean this place up, nail it down. Gentlemen, we have made history here tonight. We have finally got ourselves a live one. (epic music) (Kraa roars) (truck horn blares, tires squeal) (Kraa roars) (electronic buzzing) - It's unstable, no change. - All right I'm gonna have to bridge across the whole section. How much time do we have left? - 35 hours by your estimate. - Okay, I can do it. (sighs) I hope. - Sir, something's happened to Mogyar. - Please, make it something good if you can. - Well sir, Mogyar's been taken prisoner by some local Earth government. (dramatic music) - What news? - Kraa destruction is proceeding as planned. Planet Patrol base is still disabled. Unfortunately, my lord. - Unfortunately? - They've been able to send another agent to Earth, and with his assistance, the Earth beings may be able to destroy Kraa. - Well, then, deny them his assistance by all means possible. - It is being done, my lord. We have sent a message to Kraa. (dramatic music) (Kraa roars) (car horns blaring) (people screaming) (Kraa roars) (alarms shrieking) (Kraa roars) - Okay, people, for whatever reason, two beings from another planet have arrived here. One of them is clearly hostile. The other one you have information about. It won't talk to us, though I am told it did speak in an Italian accent last night when it was apprehended in your home. - You say apprehended. - He's no criminal. - Look I am not here to debate this with you. Your cooperation is necessary. Now, if you feel that your rights have been trampled on, you're just going to have to accept my apologies. But if you know anything that can help us, anything that can prevent needless deaths, I just suggest you park your hurt feelings and your bruised egos by the curb and you talk to me, because if you don't, and your silence costs lives, your whole future is gonna consist of small rooms with no windows, I promise you that. Now you talk to me, where are we? - What do you wanna know? - Interrogation One, right. - Mr. Bridger, you're needed in command, extremely urgent. - Right, Mr. Monroe, continue the interrogation. - Yes, sir. - All right, Mr. Collins, talk to me, where are we, what do we got? - Sir, com-sat three is picking up a broadcast. - From? - From an alien ship, sir. - And do we have a transcript? - It's coming through the crypto now. - Sir. - Sir. (epic music) (horns blaring, people screaming) (Kraa roaring) - What you are hearing now from behind me is the sound of that animal as it moves through the center of town, literally knocking buildings down as it advances. It appears to be heading in this direction, I, I don't know how much longer we'll be able to (yells) - What's the word from Washington? - Still no decision, cabinet's still in emergency session. - What's our ETA on the Jolly Green Giant out there? - If it stays on course, half an hour, unless the National Guard can slow it down. What's the matter with those Washington people? They read the transmissions, don't they know what's going on here? - Mr. Collins, that's the way it works. They make the policy, we carry it out. - Yes sir. - I'm going to order an evacuation alert. I want all personnel ready to depart the premises on a three-minute notice. - Yes sir. - Coffee, milk, no sugar. And, uh, a decaf tea for you. There you go. You did the right thing. - Yeah, then how come I feel like crap? - I wouldn't worry about that. (emergency siren wailing) (train horn blares) - Hello, Containment One, we have a no-go on surveillance. Hello, Containment One. - Okay, that's it, ladies and gentlemen, listen up. Mr. Collins, call up the evac team, priority one, red alert, let's hustle. - Hello, this is Alpha Yuma Indigo 33 Bravo, we need priority evac, full vehicle complement and security site twelve, this is a priority one. - [Captain] All right, what's going on, get me a picture up there. - Sir, camera's down in Containment One, and I've got no answer on comm. - Security, get me five men down to Containment One on the double, let's move it, and find me that alien. (crashing, roaring, alarms blaring) - What's that? - I think it's quittin' time. (roars) (Kraa roaring) - Look at me, I'm totally filthy, I've been crawling through vents for I don't know how long, it's so disgusting in there. - Hey, what's going on, do you know what that siren's all about? - Sure I know, that the big interstellar fugitive I was telling you about, Kraa? Well, he's right outside and coming here pronto. We gotta get the heck outta here. Those crazy guys in the suits, they blame me. I keep telling them it's not my fault. They had me locked in the cage. I think they wanted to dissect me. - Can you get us out of here? - Of course I can, I'm a superior form of life. Bobby, yank out the camera wire. - Okay now what? - Now, come on up here and follow me. I know a way out through the vents. Come on, hurry up, subito, subito. (sirens wailing) (Kraa roaring) - Hey hey, just because I have an exoskeleton that don't mean I'm invulnerable. - Okay. Okay Bobby, come on, it's clear, come on up. It's clear. - Oh my God, get down, get down Bobby, get down. - Kraa's too close, they won't be able to get away. - There's got to be something we can do. Able, Mogyar's in trouble, we need to work some kind of delaying action. - That'll be a neat trick from 14 light years away. - Can we use the auxiliary power to knock him back? - We don't have enough power for that by a couple of orders of magnitude. - Mogyar's mother should be still in orbit, how about the power supply on that? - I have a better idea, we'll use the ship itself. Able, send a transmission to Mogyar's mothership, crashing it into Kraa. I know it won't kill him, but it may give Mogyar some more time. - Cap, we'd go critical before I can finish the repairs. - Able, I'm sending a transmission. You're just gonna have to work faster. - Cap, wait a minute. (epic music) - The mothership is moving out of orbit. It's celebrating. - Okay Bobby, come on. Come on, come on, hurry. Come on. - Let's get outta here. - Okay. (Kraa growling) (epic music) - C'mon, let's go. - Is he dead? - [Mogyar] In your dreams. He'll be all right in a couple of minutes. Come on, hurry, let's get outta here. - Cap, you've just used up 40% of our remaining reserve. In ten hours, all that's going to be left of us is a rapidly expanding ball of plasma. - Understood. Continue with repairs, Lieutenant. - (sighs) Yes, sir, continuing with repairs. - We have our way of doing things around here in the Planet Patrol, Curtis. First, the mission, then ourselves. - Yes, sir. - Scared? - Yes, sir. - Me too. But there's a whole planet full of people who are depending on us. - He's up, sir. - What's his heading? - Uh, he's just standing there, sir. - Well, Mr. Monroe, just let me know when he starts to head this way. - Yes sir. - Look if that biker has any brains, and I'm sure he has, he's gonna shave off that beard and cut his hair, so draw up a computer configuration of him sans the bird's nest. - Yes sir. - Now I've gotta call the Secretary of State and tell him I've misplaced an alien. - Sorry, sir. (epic music) (Kraa roaring) - Listen, Mogyar, if you need to get to Naples, we oughta be able to find a flight for ya. - Sorry, kids, we're not goin' to Italy. - Why not? - Take a look. - That's pretty strange. - It's very inconvenient, let me tell you. - I mean this couldn't just be coincidence. That would be absurd. - Okay, kids, get a paper and a pencil. I need to make a little list. We're gonna have to build this thing from scratch. We're gonna need 500 pounds of 31-Argon later and it needs to fit male to female, with the female not on the single end but on the double end. - Mogyar, how in the hell are we supposed to get this stuff? It took you an hour and a half just to list it. - There must be 20 million dollars worth of stuff there. I, I mean, I'm sure I could figure out where to order it from, but it would take weeks to get it, and it's not like we can build this thing in the back of a van, either. Nah, we're gonna have to be on site to put this thing together. - Then there's that little problem of, uh, 20 million dollars? - Well, suppose we were the guy in charge of that secret base, Bridger? Now, if he wanted to get all this stuff, he could, couldn't he? And if he needed, say, the entire electrical output from the Harvest Point Nuclear Facility, he could get that too, couldn't he? He's gotta be able to just pick up a phone and call who he needs to get what he needs, just like that. - Would it be something like Alpha Yuma Indigo 33-Bravo priority one? Well I just bring it up, because that's what that Wheeler guy said on the phone when he called in that big emergency evac. - I don't suppose you got the phone number. - No, they didn't say no number. - But can't you find it, Bobby? I mean, like, with a computer or somethin'? - No, but I know some people who might be able to do it. (phone dialing) - Tell me, when you make a phone call, what's that little tune you play in the beginning? - Play a tune, what? - Yeah, like you just did. - Oh, those beeps, it's a touchtone phone. - Phone beeps, like I heard before, I see. - Then you heard the sound of the beeps when Wheeler made that call? - I sure did, you mean those beeps, that's the phone number? - Listen, Mogyar, I'm gonna run you the tones from zero to nine. - I'm listening. (phone beeping) - The phone number is 1-800-555-0005. Bada boom, bada bing. - Well, it's worth a try. Oh, and Mogyar, we're gonna need to come up with some instructions on how to put all this stuff together. Uh, what's our timeline? - I think maybe eight hours, but that's stretching it. - Jeez, okay. Hello, this is Alpha Yuma Indigo, 33-Bravo, we have a priority one request. We need to take over the Harvest Point Nuclear Facility. We need to have their entire engineering and operations staff on hand, ready to follow our instructions. (dramatic music) - The search team's finished inside the compound. No sign of the alien, no sign of the two prisoners. - Doesn't surprise me, really. It's a good bet that the three of them are traveling together, dontcha think? - Yes sir. - Um, Kraa, right? Kraa is homing in on our little friend. - Yes sir. - All right, so punch up the map of Kraa's route of travel. - Right. - Kraa comes ashore here, heading in this direction, right here toward Alma James' apartment. We acquire the alien, and we move him down to this point. Kraa turns and heads in this direction toward our base. Okay, they escape, then we see that Kraa begins to travel in an irregular pattern, because our fugitives are on the road, and so Kraa's constantly correcting his trajectory in order to follow a moving target If we extend this line out in this direction, we're gonna find our sittin' ducks. - Sir? - What? - Uh, I have a message from the Secretary of State. He wants an update on our takeover of the Harvest Point Nuclear Facility. - Have either of you authorized a takeover of the Harvest Point Nuclear Facility? - No sir. - No, sir. - Harvest Point. Harvest Point. Gentlemen, we gotta get up there before Kraa does. Let's move it, on the double, let's hustle. (dramatic music) - Well you didn't tell me how you wanted the controls laid out, so I hope this makes sense, okay? Right here, you've got your surveillance camera controls. External, internal, you can punch the picture up right here on this monitor, okay? Here, you've got your initial power. Electromagnetic, laser controls, secondary generators, phase controls, and right here, you've got your master power shunt. That'll put the full 250 megawatts right through your system. - That's fine. - You do realize, of course, that 250 megawatts of power will vaporize the whole rig you've got set up here in a third of a second. - Well, so long as it's the right third of a second, that'll be okay. You've all done a great job. Now I suggest you get your people and get out of here. We're gonna have a visitor any time now. (Kraa roars) - What's the status in there? - Everything's ready. Dr. Macek's in the conference room. - Sir, we have backup due to arrive in seven minutes. - I don't think we have seven minutes. Break out the sidearms, c'mon, let's go. (dramatic music) (electricity buzzing) (Kraa roars) - I'm powering up to ready. (beeping) - Kraa's 200 meters and approaching. - It'll be close. - Repairs are finished, the stabilizers are on recharge. Figure 11 hours until we're able to bring them online. - How much time do we have? - The core will be hypercritical within five minutes. Make that four minutes, 40 seconds. - We'll never know what hit us. - Sir, they've brought the weapon online. - Well, that's something. (beeps) (whirrs) (Kraa roars) - Hey. - Dammit! - [Mogyar] What's wrong? - I don't know, loose connection I hope. You two stay here, I'll go try to track down the fault. - Speed would be good. - They should have fired by now, Curtis. - Um, I'm checking, sir. The power's been interrupted. - He's getting mighty close. - If Kraa reaches the projector before they get that thing back online, it'll all be over. (Kraa roaring) - Oh brother, one of the guys in the chimp suits. - Back away from that panel, please. You too. - I just don't wanna fall off of the table. - Gotcha. - Nope, it's me who's got you. Drop it. Stand up, put your hands up. Hands up, move down the stairs, let's go. - Mr. Bridger. - Yeah. - [Monroe] Conference room is secure. I have the object. - Excellent work, Mr. Monroe, hold them there. Mr. Macek, do you have any idea what you've done? - Hey, are you that thing isn't loaded? - Harboring a fugitive? - You don't understand. - No, I understand perfectly well. It's you that doesn't understand. - Hey you, give me the phone. - What did you say? - Give me the phone, I wanna talk to your boss. - Dammit if we don't kill this thing now we're never gonna get another chance. - I think I'll make those calls, I'll make those decisions, so you shut up, Mr. Clean. Yeah? - The object would like to speak with you. - Put him on. - [Mogyar] Hey there, you charge, I'll make you a deal. If you let Bobby and Alma go, I'll surrender to Kraa. - Mogyar, no. - I'm sorry, Mogie, you're not offering me anything I don't already have. No deal. Move it, let's go. (speaking in Italian) - One government boy down. - How'd you do that? - Ah, I have my ways. - Mogyar, you have to operate the controls. - I think I can handle it, Alma, be careful. - Able, isn't there anything we can do from here? - Uh, nothin' but blow up, and I don't think that's gonna help them. - Yeah, us either. - Curtis, any change down there? - Um, no sir, the power's still offline. - Curtis, can you do anything? Look, you know what you're capable of, we don't. Is there anything you can do? Can you help them? - If you can, kid, do it now. - I've never tried sending my powers that far. I don't know if I can. - Curtis, try, patrolman, do what you can. (Kraa roaring) - Kraa stopped moving. - Way to go. - Let's hope that'll be enough. - Get up. Not as smart as me. (Alma grunting) - Bobby, go, go! (gunshot) - Keep goin', kid, you're holdin' it. - I can't hold on, I need your help. - Curtis, what can we do? - I need your psychic energy. - Psychic energy? - Everyone has it, but for most it's dormant. But I can use yours to increase mine. Everyone join hands. - Whoa, total mindmeld action. - Garth, concentrate. - I can't hold on. - Yes, you can, Curtis, you've got to. I can save us but I need another 40 seconds. - Save us, how? - No time, don't ask. - Kid can you do it, can you hold on? - I'm trying. (Kraa roaring) - All right, Miss James, be a good girl and things are gonna be all right now, okay? - How much longer, Able? - Sir, stop asking me. - Hold on, kid. - I can't hold on. - Done. - Done what. - It's up to them now, they have to fire that weapon. - To defeat Kraa? - To save us. - No, don't! (laser whirring) - They're firing. - And I'm rerouting. (Bobby yelling) - I used the last of our auxiliary power to redirect the beam. - And the beam will recharge the stabilizers. - In around four more seconds. - C'mon, move it. - Seventy percent. Eighty. Ninety. Full power, now. - Launch full countermeasures at Kraa. - Stabilizers are back online. - How is she? - I don't know. - Reporting for duty. - Hey, Curtis, you did it, you saved the day. - Totally sweet, Curtis. - Thanks to you guys. - You go to the infirmary, get some rest. - Yes, sir. - BASE, are you back online? - Affirmative, Captain Ruric, all functions operational. - Good, prepare the transport. Set course for Proyas. Now to deal with Lord Doom. - So, another failure. - Yes, my Lord Doom. - There must be punishment for your incompetence of course. - Yes, my lord. - Your warmth allowance is reduced by half. (whirring) - Ah, the Planet Patrol. - Lord Doom, you have violated the Omega Planetary Peace Treaty, and sending Kraa to Earth constitutes as an act of intergalactic war. You're under arrest. - Well if it isn't Ruric and his whiny space police preschool. I remember when you were still at the academy, barely able to wipe your nose. Now you're a captain. (laughs) I don't like prisons, Ruric. I don't like them at all. - You two, get Chamberlain. Doom is mine. - Ah, good, a fight! (grunting) - C'mere, you little monster. - Man, this guy's slippery as a weevil. - You're finished, Doom. - Master! - Make yourselves at home, fellas. - Enjoy your victory while you can. No prison can hold me for long. - Yeah, what he said. - Ah, shut up you little space flea, this is all your fault. - Let's go, Mogyar'll be back soon. We'll figure out what to do with these deadbeats later. - This isn't over, Ruric, I will get out of here. And then I will have my revenge. - My lord. - What? - Revenge might be easier if we use this. (evil laughter) - Curtis, good to have you back. How you feelin'? - Fine, sir, ready for duty. - And Mogyar, how about you? - Everything's just peachy, Captain. Kraa is a bunch of atoms, and I squared everything with those government guys for Bobby and Alma. So they're going to be okay. I only got the one problem. - Mogyar, when you gonna lose the accent? - Well, uh, that's my problem, you see. Because my original speech programs are onboard my mothership, which you destroyed. Not that I hold it against anybody. - You mean you're stuck talking that way? (laughter) - I don't think that this is remotely amusing. I happen to be a descendent of the Prince of Yar. I'm royalty, you know. (laughter) - Aw, c'mon you guys, it's not fun, there's got to be something you can do. Hey guys, this ain't no joke, guys, guys. (speaking in Italian) (epic music)
