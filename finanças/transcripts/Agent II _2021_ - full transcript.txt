I'm warning you, stay back. Stay back, I'll kill you, stay back! Shoot him, Frank, shoot him! Is he dead? You got him, you got him. Good lord. - That's not possible. - He's getting up! No. Run, Martha, run! Remember, deliver for any extraneous ducks, but don't kill the goose. 10-four. Copy that. Help! Help! Initial numbers are extremely promising. Reflexes, strength, you name it, all enhanced. Blood tests. First scan shows a rare, if not unique anemia. I ordered more testing. We should get the full results in a few days. Good. Perhaps we could review the results together. Together. Well, it would certainly expedite things, getting your involvement. That's not protocol. I know. My apologies. But up for consideration. Yes, sir. Don't get too comfy. What do I call you? Do you have a name? You can call me John. Dr. Jansen. I know. What's your origin. Where do you come from? Let's say I tell you. Would you even know where it is? Of course, I have the internet. Then you've heard of Planet X. Right next to Planet Y, correct? I like you. You're funny. Like your sister. How do you know my sister? We know all about you. We know everything. Where is she? Where is she? You are absolutely out of your league, Dr. Jansen. We are coming for you. All of you. Alastair. Dr. Jansen. So nice to finally meet you in person. I thought I'd never see the day. Great work finding Jim. Can I see the test results? Yes, of course. Right this way. Hi Jim. Hi Dr. Wang. How are you feeling today? Fine. And your migraines? Getting worse. Well, I think it was smart of your doctor in Chicago to refer you here. Can you stay any longer? In Los Angeles? Jim, we need to run a few more tests. Your anemia is very unusual. Your red blood cells containing hemoglobin, which they use to transport oxygen throughout your body. Unfortunately, because of the irregular shape, not enough of them are getting to your brain. Is that what's causing my sudden headaches? As I was saying, we're gonna have to conduct a few more tests, but in the meantime, I can prescribe some medication for your pain. Thanks for getting somewhere. All right, just don't take too many pills at one time. Does it look like I would? And there's one other thing that we discovered. My health can't get anyworse, can it? We wanted to be absolutely certain that we understood what was causing your symptoms, So we tested, well- - Just say it, doc. We discovered during our analyses that you're sterile. Now, look, this isn't gonna affect your health at all, but it's something I thought you'd want to be aware of. Is there something you can do about that? Well, I am one of the top hematologists in the country, so maybe with further tests, we could find the root cause of your condition. Hold on a second, I have to take this. Hey Doc? Doc? Dr. Wang? Hello? Is anyone there? Doc? Hello? Wait, did you have an episode again? You want us to come visit you? John. You're gonna shoot it. Dark Ridge sand. Jim? Dr. Jansen. Jim. How are you feeling? Physically, pretty good. Good. Sit down. You've been out for three days. That long. I tried to wake you up. What is that blue- - Energy. For lack of a better word. There are a lot of things here at the base that will defy the logic the rest of the world knows. For now you can think of it as an organic energy we use to power this facility. Doors, among other things. Angela? - Can I see her? - Sure. She's been assisting me in the lab. She okay? Yeah. Yeah, I think she can use some slowing down with the loss of your friends. She's uhm... She's obsessed. What can I do to help? Well, you're the only human up until now who's been able to resist- - The red dust? We call it Ash. Can I ask you, what were your parents like? - Biological ones? - Mm-hmm. I was adopted at an orphanage in Hong Kong. Brought me to Chicago when I was eight. Recently I went back. Wouldn't give me the records. Okay, well, if you don't mind, we'll do some research on your background. In the meantime, we took some blood samples while you were asleep. You did? Sorry, no time to waste. Angela will come and see you after your introductory combat training course. Combat training? Well, you asked how you could help, right? Yeah, but I'm no in the field type. I applied to be an analyst. Perhaps before exposure. You took out several highly trained soldiers who were under the effects of Ash. I'd say you're qualified. Couldn't save my friends, so who cares? Look. I lost my sister to this too. Many in this facility have have lost friends and family. But you're the first breakthrough we've had in years. So you'll learn how to become one of us while we test and examine your capabilities. Now suit up. Hi, you must be Jim. - Aaron. - Nice to meet you. I can't wait for you to run the gauntlet with your abilities. It's designed to test and train the best soldiers in the world. Let's get you set up with some of our new tactical gear. These are training phasers. Phasers are just like regular firearms except they fire a spherical, energized round. You're human, you get a nice little electrical jolt to signify your hit. If you're a RUNT, you get shut down. RUNTs? Robotic Unit Enforcement Trainers? Dr. Jansen didn't tell you? No. Nice to know. I'm not the only one here on a need to know basis. What's this? And I hope you don't mind if I took the liberty of upgrading your armor a little bit. I was a double-E at Cornell. Electrical engineer. So how did you get here? Well, I graduated when I was 16, and some weapons I designed ended up in the wrong hands. So to keep myself out of trouble. And the robots. You'll find out soon enough. Let's go. Right. So I got you this. I've outfitted it with a camera and a communicator. So, yeah. Thanks. Good luck. Okay, Jim, we'll start you off slow. What's my objective? Eliminate as many RUNTs as possible. Seems simple enough. Starting off on level three. Ma'am, you said slow. It's a relative term. Five. Four. Dispensing R.U.N.T.s. Two. - Now. - One. Active. How's he doing? He is turning level three into Swiss cheese. He's already on level three? Go to level four. Billy! Oh, yep, okay. Yeah. Level four. Three, two, one. Right now. Level four. Gettin' fancy, Jim. He's so fast. Level five. Ma'am. I can't watch this. Level five? Level five verified. All right, I gotta watch this. What the hell? Not bad. Run him through it again. No... Ma'am? Seriously? We are not his parents, Lucy. He's never gonna accept it. What did you expect? He was eight years old when we adopted him. I wanted a baby! Hi Jim. I'm Charles. We're your new parents. And we're gonna take you to a new place. I know. I never thought he would get into this much trouble. I didn't think so either. You tried, Charles. That's it. When he turns 18, we're done. Jim, how do you resist? Look how pathetic humans are without us. Everything feels better when I listen. There's a cure, okay? Listen to me! - Kill me, please! - I can't... No, please. Hey. Hey. Are you all right? Mm-hmm. Wait, you can't be here. Your residency. I took a leave of absence That's your dream, Angela. I can't face them right now. What do we tell them? Dr. Jansen said that they're gonna help us devise an explanation when we're ready. Can't imagine what that would be. I'm hoping that a little time here, and we'll figure it out. Together. Hey Jim. Hey, don't worry about level five. You know, it was your first time, you'll figure it out. How many levels are there? One through five is single player. Six, seven, eight, are multiplayer. Is it true that you have some of the Ash's powers? This is Higgins. He lost his parents to the Ash. I'm afraid so. Is it contagious? He would've been quarantined. I heard that they scanned your body and the Ash is somehow inert inside of you? Just in case, I'll try not to cough on you. Mr. Yung, you've been requested in conference room nine. Thanks. You're gonna meet him. - Who? - Alastair. At least that's what they call him. I heard he's here, on base. So? Who do you think's paying for this whole operation? The government? No, this is a big deal, okay? He's never been here. To conceal his identity, of course. Go! Alastair is the founder of our agency, the ESU. Extraterrestrial Special Forces Unit. Firstly, I'm sorry for what happened to your friends. Thanks. I read your application to the CIA. You did? It was a good essay. Didn't help me get accepted. Well, perhaps you weren't meant to work at that agency. Why did you start this one? About 25 years ago, I created an internet company that does blockchain financial trades using artificial intelligence. It went I.P.O.. Before I knew it, my wealth was in the league of a small number of people on this planet. I started getting invited to private elite parties. Eventually, these individuals asked me to join a secret group. But as I delved further, joining them meant serving the Kinians, a powerful alien race. I thought it was a legend, until I was asked to do something. Something I will never forgive myself for. After I left, I disappeared. It wasn't easy. They started going after all the people that were close to me, so I started this agency to protect people I care about, and the human race, for what is to eventually come if we don't stop them. What's coming? The Ash has great power, and is used as a weapon by the aliens to control human beings. For a while, they stopped using the Ash. They found they didn't need it. Greed was enough to keep us under control. Until now. What's changed? We don't know, Jim. We do know long ago, we were used as slaves and servants. There seems to be something greater they're after. You mentioned in your encounter you were able to communicate with them telepathically. Potentially. I'm not really sure. Then we need you to make contact with one of them. Try to find out what their purpose is now. There are risks you should be aware of. I prefer a more scientific approach. What are the risks? I believe you'd be entering some sort of dimension or mind realm where they store their information. Given that your mind is traveling, you may get lost and never find your way back. Or worse. I won't force you. So think about it. I believe you'd be entering in some sort of dimension or mind realm. Mr. Yung. I need you to count yourself lucky that I'm not about to haul your ass down to the precinct right now. So I need you to promise me something. I need you to promise me that I'm never gonna see you around here again. Next time, I'm not gonna be so lenient. Do you understand that? I said, do you understand that? Yes. Yes what? Yes... Sir. Good. Now get outta here. I'm Captain Linden. We have readings of a strong electromagnetic disturbance in the area. Any idea where it's coming from? Just over that ridge. I'll show you What's the deal, boys? Get down. Get down, now! Go, go, go, go! We're part of a covert task force. Group of grays who have developed biological control mechanisms. They're starting to move. I'll buy 'em off. Dr. Victoria Jansen, trust no one else! Hey Jim Jim. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. The team's back. Sorry, what? - Who? - Our main faction. Yeah, we're number 53. Every base has a number. Ours is 53. There's 52, 51. You may have heard of, the government likes to act like it's one of theirs. That's Smith, Rogers, Bell, and Captain Linden. Captain Linden. He looks a lot like the marine I met in the desert. We don't talk about his brother. Hey. Hey, this is Jim. Yeah, we know. We heard you wrecked the gauntlet. Practically demolished it. That's good. But RUNTs aren't marines. Well... I don't know, Cap. He did pretty well. You should check his scorecard. I was lucky. Let's try your luck in a scrimmage. Sorry? You, Aaron, Billy versus us three. I'll give you Smith, he's one of my best soldiers. So it'll be four V three. I don't think that's a good idea. No way. It'll be fun. You can keep Smith. I'll take Higgins. May the best team win. Are you crazy? Why did you just do that? We'll see. No, you... "We'll see." Okay. This is amazing. - Turns red blood cells- - Yeah. The irregularly shaped ones. The robot added some Ash to his blood in the isolation chamber. Here are some normal red blood cells with the Ash, and Jim's red blood cells. - Won't let the Ash latch on. - Yeah. Because of their shape and form. And without a proper connection, the Ash can't circulate in the blood like it wants to. Where does he get all of his strength from, the healing, the stamina, like the others? It looks like some sort of advanced human gene therapy. But what really stands out is that Jim has a set of genes that I can't seem to match or identify with anything we've seen before. Do you think that's the key to the cure? To identify those specific genes? I hope so. You did genetic screening in your residency, right? Yeah. How'd you know? We have access to all the information here. Why don't you track down an old blood sample of Jim's and start comparing it with a new blood sample? Okay. Jim, we meet again. Really, how are you? Where's John? You want to come inside and see? Try and talk to the other John? He's doing just fine. Maybe even better than before. Where are we? I don't know. Another dimension, realm. Hey Jim, I may have found something, but there's something blocking me from taking you further. What do I do? Find a way to get better access. See? We are the ones in control. You are making amazing progress. But I still can't interface with them. It's still on his terms. That'll come. So what do you think? Does it make lattes? Where does it go? All over the world. How did you discover these tunnels? I didn't. A villager in China discovered the Long Yo Caves back in the '90s. Computer, tell Jim about the Long Yo Grotto Caves. Experts estimate it would have taken 1000 workers working day and night for six years to remove 900,000 cubic meters of solid rock. And we just reverse engineered this ship to travel through. We've only been operating for the past few years. Who created these tunnels? Computer, how good are you at making lattes? Unparalleled. The Kinians are an alien race that settled on Earth 500,000 years ago. They are back, Jim. The meteor you stumbled upon, its frequency is increasing. Forget about movies where gigantic ships land in our cities. This is a real war, and they're using the same tactics we use to take over a country and install a government that serves our own economy from the inside. When I learned about the aliens from Captain Linden, I wanted to run. You should have. You know, I never felt so much ability, power. But... Most people still would've run. When I saw what the Ash was capable of, I knew they would find us, and they would find Angela. In protecting the ones we love, the world can be stronger. All right, I'll set it to team competition mode, 100 point score card. Each RUNT kill is worth a point. A player kill is worth 10, juggernaut's worth 25. Juggernaut? Yeah, it's a... Nevermind. Okay. - Put 'em in their place. - Copy that. You guys stay center. Check. You got it. Can't wait. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Clear, advance. Go! Let's pick it up. Copy that. - How we doing? - We're behind in kills. We need to take out their team to catch up. Dammit! Sorry, team. Yes! You're out. Jim, we're down 15. Don't focus on the juggernaut, he's worth 25, but he'll be really hard to take out by yourself. You're better off taking down Linden and Bell. Jim, take Bell out! Ah, man. Hey, big man. Over here! Nice job. Good game. Thanks. What have you got? Okay, there's there's already some obvious findings. It's like the Ash turned on genes related to human function. Activated them somehow. Huh, what functions? Okay, so for example, his DNA over here handles his adrenal glands, and this one muscle fiber recruitment. - Strength. - Yeah. His white blood cell production, platelets, immune system over here. Healing. What about the liver? Is it his weakness, like the others? I'm not sure. The liver's the one organ that's extremely complicated in terms of its DNA because of its regenerative properties. My guess is yes. I'm hoping that I'm wrong. Too bad we can't test your theory, huh? Good job, Angela. I mean, Doctor. You're one also, right? Second year of residency. Good. For you and for what you have... Oh my god, can you imagine the possibilities? What we could learn? We could heal people. We could maybe cure cancer. Why couldn't this happen to somebody stronger? Smarter? What if this did happen to someone else? Hey, I think there's a reason it was you. I'm not even average. Do you remember when I was studying for my NCATs? Of course I do. It's because you spent all that time quizzing me that I scored so well. That's not average. Who you are... It's not average. You're crazy. I know. Oh. You're capable of anything. Except maybe cooking. Was something that we already did - where I specified which team- - You want to sit with us? Really? I'm fine here. Okay. You can join us if that's okay. - I can. - Have a seat. Really like the new M4s. Handle really nice. Light, powerful. Thanks, I've made some upgrades here and there. So you did really well in training. Thanks, but you guys won. Really? I mean, I'd say it was more of a tie. Look, I read your case file. You reported when John was first infected, you shot him in the chest. Ash leaked out, touched your hand, and somehow his memory and special forces skills are ingrained in you? Something like that. It still doesn't explain your courage. What are you talking about? Look, I've fought with a lot of men, and under pressure, they fold when outnumbered or outgunned and you weren't even playing the same game as everybody else. I just did what came to me. Maybe you're just not aware of what you're capable of yet. Excuse me. Where's she going? We found some records on your biological mother. You'll be glad to know she's doing well in Hong Kong. Thanks, it means a lot. You wouldn't happen to know who and where my father is. We're working on that. Don't worry. I'm sure he's out there. Can I ask you something? Sure. I lost my close friends, Dr. Jansen lost her sister. But you, what did they do to you? What could possibly be so wrong that you can't share? That doesn't matter now. It does to me. Why? Isn't avenging your friends motivation enough? No, it's not. I love them, but I have to think that they're in a better place. If they were taken by the Ash, they're not free. How do you know that? You're not ready yet. I believe in what you're doing here. I just need to understand. I said you're not ready yet. But as I know you more, I am confident you will be soon. Jim, Jim, Jim. Oh, Jim. Jim. People observing us. Can you hear what they're saying? No. Talking about you. Seems to be happening a lot lately. How can you trust them? They've given me no reason not to. Is that all you got? Your opinion? What are you talking about? Look around you, Jim. The answer's right in front of you. This is getting us nowhere. seeing Angela and I together must be hard. I'm gonna ask Angela to marry me. - Seth. - Try to get him back. He was about to marry the love of your life. She's better off without me. Nothing can stop us. Did you even tell Angela why you left? That you can't have kids? You're a coward, Jim. We plug into a socket and the energy that flows out is blue. Why is the energy that comes from the RUNTs orange? The orange energy is like a filtered, lower energy than blue energy, so you don't get hurt. If they were firing blue energy, you would hurt a lot more. Trust me. You're an engineer, right? Is all energy the same? No, no, no, no, no. There's light energy, heat, gravitational, mechanical, electrical, sound, chemical, atomic, and so on. But that's not the question. Do you know what the billion dollar question is? I don't know, I failed physics. Aren't all Asians good at physics? Is that the question? No, I was kidding. Okay, the real question is, is not all energy the same, it's are these new energies that we've never discovered before- - Can you stop asking me questions? Okay, this energy doesn't seem to flow from any traditional power plant. It's not in any of the textbooks. Now, Einstein said energy is neither created nor destroyed. Then it had to have come from somewhere. Where does the energy to this building come from? I've never checked, but... It's gotta be somewhere close, right? Hey, I'e checked all the cameras for a generator room, - nothing's popping up. - That's impossible. Well, a generator for this size facility would be massive. This entire facility is covered in security cameras. If it were here, we would see it. Check the security drawings, or maybe the power lines go somewhere. Okay, pulling it up. Nothing. That we can see. I mean, it wouldn't be listed, right? Hold up. - What? - Wait a second. There's a room where all the power lines seem to feed into. Where? It's in the gauntlet. - You can't be serious. - Yeah. She's right. How do we get there? Well, it's technically near the exit, but- It's blocked. Sectioned off. According to the gauntlet design schematics, these barriers will move if we beat level eight. No one's ever beat level eight. Captain Linden and his team have come close. Yeah, the keyword's close. There's no way. - Just hear him out. - Why? Let's say you can infiltrate the tower. Get the map, relay the codes, and diffuse the bomb. Do you even know what the pain threshold is on level eight? I understand the risks. No you don't. On level eight, hardcore mode is enabled. Which means anything that can cause damage, like explosives or ammo, could kill. That's why we never train on level eight. Cap, listen, he's right. We never truly questioned the way things work around here- - It's not our job to question orders. It's not a job, Cap. Well, count me out. And consider yourself off my team if you help these guys. Cap! Maybe you should sit this one out. What are you talking about? I'm in. Excuse me. Cap. Cap! He's gonna get us all killed, Bell. You don't know that. Do you remember what happened last time we tried this? Yeah. He's not the first, he's not gonna be the last. We have to give him a chance! I'm not losing another person I care about- - You care? No one is gonna die! How do you know that? Because, he's.... Don't let your feelings for him- - Whoa. Feelings? Yeah. Who said anything about feelings? Are you jealous? No. That's... Let's be clear. This is why we are all here. Okay? We tried before and now we finally have a shot at answers. It's not happening, Bell. Okay guys. Level eight is booting. Hardcore mode enabled. Alert, game impacts can be fatal. - So the tower? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you were jealous. You're still off the team after this. Okay, we go stealth on stage one and take the hill that has the map. Jim, you're with me. Five. You three on the right. Four. Three. - Two. - Copy that. - One. - Game starting. Active. On you. Okay. Code room is in the upper left quadrant. Bomb is located center right. Bell and Aaron, head to the code room, Jim and I go to the bomb for diffusing. - Got it. - Go. You've been practicing. A little. You're doing great, guys. We're in. Okay guys, get on decoding the module in order to diffuse the bomb. You got five minutes. You ready with the codes, Aaron? Yep. Sigma. Four. Beta. Eight. That it? Almost there. What happened? You gave to the main symbol? Are you sure that was beta? I told you it wasn't good at math. You said physics. Same thing! Get going, guys. Come on. Okay, let's move on to wire cutting. That's our only way. A1. - Yes. - One minute left. Hurry! Another wave coming. Let's get this. D2 to B3. D2 to B3. None of them are listed. That's exactly what happened last time. Bell's hit. It's unbeatable. Abort mission. Billy, Aaron, get out of there. Let's go, Jim. Right behind you. They're not gonna make it. There's a 50-50 chance. Where's Jim? What are you doing? It's a 50-50 chance. Jim, get out of there! What's wrong, Slim Jim? Didn't see my foot? Couldn't tell if your eyes were open or not. Oh my god, you know, for three seconds you were worth something. I'm sorry, I just can't accept these grades, buddy. I think he shouldn't eat it. That's a brilliant idea. Should make him eat all of them. Every F. Why you still down, boy? Thought you were born with self-defense mechanisms. Do you think anyone actually cares about you? The only reason you're here is to fill the void for you're infertile mommy and daddy. Very good, Jim. I thought I was dead. The bomb was merely to stun you, as I had designed it. I'm sorry, the stakes had to be high. - The team? - Oh, they're fine. I've talked to them already. I never thought anybody could beat level eight. Did they get to the generator? I assumed like the others, you were only interested in avenging your friends Because after my son died... He was a Navy SEAL. He hated everything I stood for. I never told him about my dealings, but he knew. The Kinians asked me to invite him to one of my vacation homes. He didn't want to visit me, but I begged him. I thought they were just gonna scare him. But they used the red Ash on him, and it made him give up all his intel. Names of undercover agents, missions for the government, everything. Then they killed him. They said he was too dangerous to keep alive. I myself was consumed with revenge. But after a long spiritual journey, I let go. And when I did, that's when I realized the Ash with a human soul. That's where it gets its energy. The human soul is a life force, regenerative. Can expand or contract. And one of the most powerful energies we know. It can power this facility. Just 10 seconds of my life energy, or mana, is enough to power this facility for an entire day. You can power this facility by yourself? Have you ever heard the term ashes to ashes, dust to dust? How do you think the Earth's population is able to continue to grow? When someone dies they're supposed to return to a pool of mana. This facility is built on top of a small pool. You are not consumed with revenge. Rather, you are fueled with purpose to help others. I'm no one. Ah, you are more than that. And I will help you achieve your true potential. Place your hand there. It's there, Jim. Through training with me, you will learn. Breathe. To be selfless... One must trust others. So it's not a big machine powering this place? Far from it. Again. But first... Nice. Good. Bell, you're up next. Choose a partner. I choose Jim. What? I don't want to hit a... Girl? You must trust yourself. What if it wasn't just any girl? All right. What if it was your girlfriend? Now let's do one, two. Slip, uppercut, bam, blow underneath. Left hook. To be selfless... Is to give of oneself. Wanna think of turning the hip over, keeping that knee parallel to the ground as you swing and kick. Let me see it. Wholeheartedly. You're getting it. Yeah. What do you think? He's the best we could have hoped for. Dedicated. Driven. I worry it's not enough. If he's anything like you... We should keep testing him, pushing his limits. See what... I understand. But knowing more can have a huge impact on Project Alpha. That meditation stuff. It's never going to work. I need more lab resources to do the genetic analysis. It can't just pay me in some new doctor doing it. Look at this place, it's falling apart. Do you think it's easy funding an operation like this? There are forces that are freezing my bank accounts. I need to offshore my finances, and cannot be detected. When's the last time that you had to think about funding? You think it just happens? People take this for granted, but it's a process, and there are limits so we can remain undetected. Yes, sir. I cannot believe that you got them to deliver this all the way out here. - What? - Yeah. You're amazing. The guy definitely got a big tip. Good. He loved you. I just wish she hadn't wanted to visit me. It was my fault. I kept talking about you so much. He practically planned the whole trip for me. Why'd you leave, Jim? Was it 'cause of my job? I know that I can get consumed with work sometimes. No. No, no, it was... I love every part of that about you. You'd come home from the hospital, talking about delivering babies. Made me want to be a good person. You are a good person. No I'm not. Not if I hurt you. You'd never hurt me. I can't have children, Ange. So? So, you love children. We could adopt. And what? Do you know what it was like for me growing up? How can I? You never talked to me about it. You don't want to hear it. Why are you always trying to protect me? 'Cause no one protected me when I was growing up, okay? My adoptive parents? When they had to bail me out jail, they gave up on me. Do you know what it's like to be abandoned twice? Come here. There's nothing you could ever tell me that would make me abandon you, okay? Jim. How's Angela? She's fine. She's your weakness, Jim. How so? Because you care. What about you? You still care about anybody? Not even your wife? Your son? No. You sure? What was his name? No. - What about your son, John? - No. Shut up! What about him? Shut up! Shut up. What about your son? No. What abt your son! Jim. You have to find a way to reach me, okay? John. John. This is crazy and dangerous. Can we at least wait a day or two for this? Let's run more tests. See what our options are. I'm not sure if John can hold out. We should keep going. Alastair, we don't know what's on the other side. He could die. Jim, it's not worth it. Alastair. What do you need? To be selfless is to trust oneself. He's ready. Good luck. I'm sorry, I didn't order any. It's on the house. You look like you need it. Thank you. We're in the same school. Yeah. We're in the same math class. Mr. Jenkins's class. I'm always in the back, you're always in the front. Otherwise you'd probably recognize me. Oh, I recognize you. Do you work here? What am I saying? Of course you do. I'm saving up to go to college and then go to medical school. Why? I mean, these days it's better to work on Wall Street and make a lot of money. Doctors don't make a lot of money for the years they put in, but you can't put a price tag on helping a mother and father bring a new life into this world. I wouldn't know what it's like to have a mother and father. I'm sorry. How do you know that you want to become a doctor? I just told you. But how did you start? Babysitting. Not kids, but babies. Really? Really. Like what? Like everything, you know, that they're so helpless and all they want is your love. They know nothing else. They've yet to know about all the things in life, like fancy cars, big house, you know, none of which will make you truly happy. It's a gift to care for a baby because you have to be selfless. You can't at any point just stop caring for one. So you wanna be a doctor now? No, but thank you. Maybe I'll find something to do someday. Just like you. You will. You have to be selfless. Maybe I'll find something to do someday. Like you. I've been waiting for you. Where are we? I don't know. My soul. My mind. A little bit of both. I'm not quite sure. We used to take my son here. It's beautiful. Ah. You're in my house now. I wouldn't show you the garage first. What do we do now? I don't know. But what I do know is that selflessness is to trust others. So trust Alastair. Hey Jim. Tell my son I love him. You're fine. I'm sorry about this, Jim. Let's see if this kills you. Seth? Send me back. Where? What else did you see? The mana. They want all of Earth's mana. Here. Take this. It belonged to him. He was a great warrior. And a great man. Just like you. We're getting you outta here. No, it's too late. There's so much... Thank you. The RUNTs. They've gone berserk. She's reprogrammed them to kill humans. I was just at the main exit, it's blocked. We should move for Alastair's ship, then. Where's Angela? She's trapped in the lab. I gotta get to her. No, there's no time. Leave without me if I don't make it. You'll make it. We'll wait for you. Let's go. Here. So you can find us. Alastair is dead. Well done. My sister. She's here. Where is she? Come, I'll show you. No no, no! Now we are one. - Yeah? - Yeah. I got your six. Angela? Jim? - Angela! - Jim! Are you okay? I'm fine. Now who's in control, Jim. You're pathetic. I did love you, too much. That's what made me weak. Now I'm stronger. I'm better. Angela. Isolation chamber activated. Danger, decontamination process commencing. Angela. What are you doing? No, Jim. Go. No. Go! I love you. Oh, please. Don't do this. We are in control, Jim. Not working! Moving! On the right! In lockdown. Jim, what's your location? We're pinned down. Jim, what's your con? Come on, come on. I can't hold them off forever. We're gonna get pinned! On your five, on your five. - Higgins. - Huh? Can you cut through this? No problem. I'm on it. They keep coming! That can't be good. There are too many! Yes. Door open. Guys, come on, come on, let's go. Move it. Let's go, let's go, let's go! A simple thank you... Where are the controls? I don't know, you think they'd have a manual. Figure it out. We're going back for Jim. I've been waiting for you. - I'm impressed. - I'm just getting started. Before we left Earth, we killed all the half-Kinians. At least I thought we did. What? Yes. You didn't sense it? No. That's how you can resist the Ash. Humans are much more easily manipulated. Look at Angela. Her mind defied the Ash's control. But love has no stamina. It's so very... Delicate. Go for the hand. When we built the Ash, we focused on harnessing human greed. Enhancing it. Utilizing hate. Fear and anger. Emotions more accessible. I've had enough hate and anger in my life. Never solved any of my problems. Sacrifice. Love. Selflessness. That's when I turned my life around. That's when I had hope. And I'm never going back. - Jim! - Jim, over here! There's gotta be a computer. Hello. That's your name? Computer? Yes. Okay, we're gonna have to change that. Okay. Now we're talking. I can do this. Oh, don't touch that. Let's go. Took you long enough. Computer, start the engines. Starting engines. - Okay. - Where to? Take us to where Alastair wants us to go. Affirmative. How'd you know to hit the hand? Oh, you can thank Bell for that. Take off in three. - Lucky guess. - Two. One. Engage.
