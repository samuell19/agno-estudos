(catchy music) ♫ Nurse can you help this man ♫ He's got a bad case of the blues ♫ Nurse he's fading fast so I hope you won't refuse ♫ He gets so excited ♫ When you walk through his door ♫ Even gone up five degrees ♫ You can pulse rate soar ♫ Don't give him no pill ♫ And he don't need no shot ♫ All he needs is a little of what you got ♫ - [Matt] Hey! Hey girls, how about some company? (rescue sirens) (dramatic music) (rescue sirens) (dramatic music) - Nurse! Where is your uniform? - I'm off-duty now. - And on display. - You gotta get the meat to market. - [Joanne] This is a stickup. - Joanne, this is an operation. - Where have been, nurse? We don't wait around here, you know. When we operate, we operate. Scalpel. - Which one, doctor? - What would you use? Damn it, learn something here, take a look. What would you use? Come on. Give me 20. Damn it. Wasn't for the doctor, poor kid would be pushing daisies. - [Joanne] It would be the first fatal shoulder blade in the history of medicine. - [Doctor] Is someone talking? Is someone carrying on a conversation in my operating room? Give me a clamp. You call that a clamp? Use your head, this is a person we're cutting not a Christmas turkey. Out, get over here. Jesus. - I'm getting a really weird reading on him. - [Doctor] Weird? Is that now a medical term? What are you getting, flying saucers? - His respiratory flow volume's dropped from seven liters to three. - [Doctor] Nothing to worry about. Kid's had congenital spots on one lung since he was, well since the first time I saw him when I was holding him in one hand. Give me a forceps, here. No, I. Oh, you're right, you're right. Don't give me what I ask for, give me what I need. - Congratulations. It's a shoulder blade. - Really? Is he really okay? - The mother and the shoulder blade are doing fine. - Oh, good. - They're putting him in 314. - Thanks a lot, okay? - In seven minutes, I'll be exploring the gastrointestinal tract of one Ms. Imbrolio. Meanwhile, we have this room that old Ed left who departed us last night. - Leaving us? - His invitingly and vacant room and bed. - In seven minutes? Sorry, doc. (peaceful music) - Hi. - Where's the ocean? - Oh, the ocean's still out there. We had a little accident. - Hey boy, how's tricks? - Looks like they pulled one on me, dad. - They say some babe had to pull you out of the drink, huh? - Excuse me. - Who sent you the flowers, nobody even knows you've been sick. - I did. - What is that? - Just the babe who pulled him out of the drink. - Dumb. Dumb thing to do. If you don't control your boom, it's gonna control you. Now, if you screw up like that in that regatta, you're gonna a crew mutiny on your hands. I'm his crew. Well, up and at 'em, man. I gotta go, business calls, you know. Wait a minute, I almost forgot. Just in case you wanna buy yourself a cigar, huh? - Thanks, dad. - Okay baby, take it easy. - He's not much on formalities, neither am I. Hey, who are you? - Just the babe who pulled you. I'm Kitty. - I'm Matt. Why do hospitals always have to smell like hospital. - Here, how about a breath of ocean breeze number five. - Hi! How is he? (amorous music) (funky music) (door knocking) - Teddy? Teddy? (rescue sirens) - Every time a junkie dies the crime rate goes down. - That kid is not a junkie. I've been treating him for two months. - For what? - Conjunctivitis. - My ass. - His eye. My job is to take care of people who can't give back to the hospital. - Yeah well, you got one less patient to worry about. - Hey, lighten up on him. - Hey lady, the kid's dead. - So just go on and let him die, right? - Part of the job. Nothing in the rule book says I gotta go to the funeral. - Give it up, man. (pleasant music) - Dr. Krebs was right about one thing, you are a fast-rising young surgeon. - What are you doing? No exercise, doctor's orders. - You know how many doctors have made that same statement to me? - Turn over and be quiet. - [Matt] That's enough, thanks. - No, it's not enough. Look, I didn't ask for this job. Hey, I'm lying. I requested this duty. I got jealous when I thought of anybody else doing it. - You mean someone was killed by this stuff? - Yeah. - It's amazing. I'd love a chance at the body. I'd like to run some tests on a guy who died from an injection of vitamin B, B-12, E, and niacin. - I mean, that's all there was. - Not in the binding agent, whatever that was. It wasn't enough to kill him. - Then what did? - Check back with me tomorrow. I'll see if the body of your late friend can tell me anything. - Okay. - He's in there throwing needles at that poor old lady like she was a dartboard. - This woman has no veins, it's fantastic. Is that possible? - [PA System] Nurse Henderson, staff 317. Nurse Henderson, please. - The call of the wild. If this woman has a vein, you find it. - [PA System] Dr. Krebs to surgery, Dr. Krebs. Anyone knowing disassembling procedures for a revolving door, report to maintenance. - I'll stay with her a while. Can you run into 328, and give Mr. Farrell his penicillin for me? Remember, just pinch the skin and plunge cleanly. - Pinch the skin and plunge cleanly. Sure. - Why can't they just let me die? Or go to Philadelphia? - They didn't have one single magazine about boats, do you believe that? - That's okay, maybe This Old Life's got a sports section. - Hey kid, you're looking good. Looks like you can sail this afternoon. Here are some pictures for you. Wow, look at that view. Can almost see the boat from here. - I think it would be better if we could keep his mind off of boats for a while. - Look it, so the kid's got a little problem. You treat him like an invalid, he's gonna become an invalid. - Well, if I'd known how hard you were trying to kill him, I wouldn't have bothered saving him. - He's not trying to kill me. - Kindness kills too, you know. - Which way do you prefer, Matt? - [Mr. Fairbanks] What's with her? - I understand you've been giving medical lessons again? - I needed some help. - When she first came here, my ambition, which I have achieved, was to be head nurse not head doctor. You would be wise to have a similar ambition in your hostile mind. - I am not hostile. You know there aren't enough doctors here. I can take care of some of the smaller jobs, takes the pressure off them for the more important things. - You wanna do a doctor's job. You want the candy stripers to do your job, then who's gonna do you the candy striper's job? The cleaning ladies? You get your way, you'll have the patients emptying their own bedpans. - No, I wouldn't, emptying bedpans is a nurse's job. - The binding agent wasn't a binding agent at all. It was drug called quagrin. - Never even heard of it. - The government refused to approve it. It had a couple of problems. First of all, it was an aphrodisiac. - Seems there'd be a market for that. - I'd buy it, unfortunately, it was a couple of other things too. Just a tad more than the proper dosage, you started hallucinating. And then by the time you're getting tired of whatever vision you were having, you went into a coma. - Nothing like happy endings for a hallucination. - Oh, it got happier. Up the dosage another zip, it's time to pick your pallbearers. Once they found out what the stuff was, they locked it up. - Well, you can tell them some of it's leaking out. - [Haskell] In, come on Jeff. Out. Keep right on going, just the way you do it all the time. Up and down, up and down, up and down. Come on, run, run, run, run, run. Hey, for crying out loud. Take it easy, take it easy, Jeff. - Oh, I'm sorry. Leave him alone, I'm a nurse. Come on. How do you feel? - I'm okay, Doc. - Oh, that's fine, Jeff. That's fine, that's fine. Now let's come up. That was very reckless of you, you know that. - I'm sorry. - Are you really all right? - Doctor? - Yes, that's right. I think that's wonderful. - Hey, don't you remember me? - No. - Michelle. Michelle-- - [Haskell] Rhodes. - Right, right. - [Haskell] Sandy's daughter. How are you doing? - [Michelle] I'm fine. - A nurse, now? - Right. - All right, you come right down here. - I'm really sorry. - Well, well, well, so and what are you in now, surgery? - Medicine. - Medicine? Oh. Are you all right? You all right, Jeff? That's good. (groaning) Sit down, that's fine. You all right now? Sandy Rhodes's daughter. - Yeah. - I just didn't know you were all grown up. - Dr. Haskell, have you ever heard of a drug called quagrin? - [Haskell] Hmm? - [Michelle] I'm trying to find out where it comes from. A friend of mine was killed by it. - [Haskell] I'm sorry to hear that. Quagrin? Nope, never heard of it. You see, I try to use natural herbs instead of drugs. There's so many new names of drugs in the medical monthly. If I run across quagrin, I'll let you know. - [Michelle] Thank you, I'd appreciate that, doctor. - Hold the speculum closed. Now just relax, take your time, that's right. Now hold the mirror like that. Now you can see if there's any sign of infection. You're fine. And it didn't cost you 40 bucks to find out. If you should see any sign of infection, the best thing to do is just pick up some plain yogurt. - No flavor. - [Joanne] Oh, I don't think you're going to notice. - I was thinking of my boyfriend. - Come on, get dressed. - Do you really think you're going to get that grant? - I do. You really think you're going to come work for me? - I don't see how I could survive on $50 a week. - You would be surprised how long it takes to starve to death. I've lasted over a year. - I've lasted longer than that, and I don't make any money at all. You should get your boyfriend to pay for everything. - You're not looking at the whole thing. - The thing that you don't like is that it's run by a woman. - The thing I don't like is it's unlicensed. It's unusual. - It's a lot more effective than anything you could do, and a hell of a lot cheaper. I don't see her driving one of those fancy Aston-Martins. - Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to quit cashing my paychecks? - I just want you to start caring about something besides them. (upbeat music) - [Michelle] Hey, fella! Lester! - Well, I'll be. All good things come to those who wait. (laughing) What's happening? How are you doing, baby? - Okay. Been working a lot. - There used to be a time when you didn't have to work so much. - It used to be nice until you said, "Hey baby, let's go down to the Baja." And you forgot to tell me that pinata you picked up was full of Peruvian cocaine. - Hey baby, I ain't dealing in nothing now except with this boat yard here. - Oh yeah? I was kind of hoping you were still on the streets. - Well, I still hear something every now and then. - Lester, you ever heard of a drug called quagrin? - [Lester] No. - I didn't neither until today. - Hey baby, remember that poncho I brought back from La Paz? Won't you go inside and put it on, and I'll take you out somewhere. - Okay. Is it still in the same place? - [Lester] You know it. - Hey Lester! No, nah-uh! Come on, get your hands off the bike. Last time you missed with it, you blew out my gear box. And had me walking for two days. - You gonna meet me later or what? - Let's make it tomorrow, I have to make some runs. - [Lester] 4:30 at the Studio? - [Michelle] Okay. Bye-bye. - Ciao. - This is an exercise. Sitting is an exercise, lying in a bed is an exercise. - What exactly are you in training for? - Oh, for life, I guess. - What? - No, for the regatta, really. - Matt, you can't sail with that shoulder. - Don't tell me I can't. - All right, I won't tell you you can't. - I like people who tell me I can. - [Kitty] Okay, you can. (charming music) - Oh, a little private duty, too, huh nurse? - Just physical therapy. - A treat instead of a treatment, and I'll bet she's pretty good at it, huh Matt? - [Matt] Dad? - Aw come on, you know me, I'm only kidding you. Life's a ball, you gotta take it and run with it, right? I gotta run too, you take care of yourself. - Oh god, I bet the night nurses forgot to mark his injection again. The second time in a month. Nancy, get me Dr. Krebs, quick. What's he doing operating? - He's not gonna die or anything. - Laboratory emergency. Yeah, this is Joanne. I got a patient with a double dose of insulin. I need glucogen, 1 cc, stat. Well, I'm ordering it. Dr. Krebs authorization. The man's in a coma so get it quick. If you go into medicine, do it as a doctor. (blues music) (rescue sirens) - What a time to be a manager of a rock star. In the middle of a song, his voice breaks. I'm paying $85 an hour for this studio, you guys go back in there and play. - What I wanna know is why didn't you just drive him to the hospital? - Because it looks a little more real to take him to the hospital in an ambulance. - Oh, looks terrific in the papers, too. - Right, but this guy can't sing, he can't even hum. (screaming) - Do you know her blood type? Get her admitted, I'll meet her in surgery with a cross-match. - But you know you can't do that. - You worry about her, I'll take care of it. I need one unit, universal donor type blood, now. - Unauthorized? Forget it. - That woman does not need three copies of a doctor's signature, she needs blood, now. - And it's cross-matched. Okay. I'll tell them I had nothing to do with it. - Tell him whatever you want. Tell him I bit you on the neck for it, just give it to me. Thank you. - Nurses. - That patient will not be admitted to the hospital until we have his full name. - You got his full name. Chicken is his full name. Ask five million record buyers, Chicken is his full name. - [Dockett] His age? - We don't give that out. - [Dockett] Who do you think you are? - I'm his manager. I get 15 percent of everything he gets, including his pain. - Does he have hospitalization? - How are you gonna get insurance on a guy that started four riots in six weeks? Or six riots in four weeks, we can't even count. - Then we can't admit him. - What? - [Dockett] We've had too many experiences with people who don't pay their bills. There's no way to repossess an operation, you know. - Look lady, this guy gets $60,000 a riot. Four more riots, he could buy the hospital. Now, he doesn't need an operation, he just has a little laryngitis. What's he doing in a wheelchair anyway? - I can have you put into a wheelchair too, buster. - Thanks, I'll walk. I'll take him to his room. - Hold it, buddy, I'm taking him to his room. - I have to have a last name on that creature. - Well, if it'll make you happy, his full name is Chicken Delight. (phone ringing) - [Kitty] Aren't you glad I got you out of the hospital? - [Matt] You better believe it. - Now, isn't this more fun than sailing a boat? - Well, some people like sailing boats and some people like flying kites. Besides, sailing isn't the only thing that give me pleasure. - Oh yeah? - [Matt] Yeah. - What gives you pleasure? - You. - What are you doing? - I'm flying a kite. (pleasant music) Hey! (barking) - Hi! Come on, come on. (barking) - What are we gonna do with the kite? (exciting music) (panting) (screaming) - [Michelle] No! - Hey! (groaning) - No business calls? - This is business. - Then get down to it. And let's stick to business, shall we? - You're a nurse, right? Then you stick to being a nurse. You take care of my boy's body, but you don't fuck with his mind. - I'm not. My job is to help him get well. - Listen, girl. - [Kitty] You listen. It's more important for Matt to get better than to sail in some race just so that you can get your picture in the paper. - Do you know who you're talking to? - Mm-hmm, a man who's getting older. And who's mad because his son is getting more attention. - That kid's gonna live to be 80, but he won't be half as good as I am in any way. - Mr. Fairbanks, I hate to be the one to tell you this, seeing how much you love competition. But this is one race you've already lost. - Why you little bitch, I'll show you who's lost-- (yelps) Goddamn it. (grunting) (tense music) (screaming) (groaning) - And she said to him, "Well you guys all have your brains "between your legs." And then he tells her, he said, "Well, that gives me a mind-blowing idea." - Look like you got hit by a typhoon, girl. - Can we go sit down? - Take my hat. Detective business getting rough, huh? - Just ran into a couple of guys didn't like me looking around. Shit, it took me a damn hour to get my bike running. Lester baby, you have got to help me. - Hey baby, the best way I can help you is to tell you to cool it. Or he can take you with me. - With what? He hasn't got a dime to take me on. - Then I'll find one. - Hey. (laughing) I wanna-- - You wanna what? - What's wrong? (funky music) - Quagrin? - Yeah. - Did you know? - [Lester] No. - Oh, how much? Enough to kill me? - No. - Well then, enough for what? - Whatever you want. Michelle. Come here, baby. Come here. Come on. (psychedelic music) (tense music) - [Kid] Mommy look, he's dead. (mellow music) (suspenseful music) - Yes, Marina Del Ray. I need the listing for the CU Club. - [Haskell] Quagrin, nope, never heard of it. - Operator, forget it. Thanks. - Hi, Michelle. - Hi, Kitty. - See what I made for Matt? - [Michelle] Hey, beautiful. - I thought as long as he was gonna not be on his boat this would be the next best thing, you know. - Yeah, listen, I gotta be on duty in half an hour, but I gotta make a run, can you cover for me? - Sure. - Thanks. - Anything wrong? - No, I just gotta get a prescription filled. (toilet flushing) - What are you doing dressed? - I'm leaving. - You're what? - I'm not gonna miss that race. My father's checking me out. - But that's dangerous. - [Matt] I'll survive. - [Kitty] Hey, I brought you. (giggling) - It's a candy striper's job to make the patient's stay in the hospital more pleasant. - This is not what we mean by pleasant. - It was pleasant, wasn't it? - You do have a tendency to overstep your authority occasionally. - When there are enough doctors, I'll stick to emptying bedpans. - You did order that emergency cross-match yesterday. You should've waited. - The patient couldn't wait. - Well, I'm glad you admit it anyway. Shows you're willing to accept the responsibility for your actions. But it's unfortunate that because of what you did that woman now has septicemia. We'll be lucky, frankly, if she lives. Because if she lives, she'll sue. - Is there anything I can do. - You can stay home for a day or two until I can get the board together for a hearing. - I am sorry. - I'm sorry too, Joanne. For a nurse, you're a hell of a doctor. And you should've waited. We'll be lucky, frankly, if she lives. - [Nurse Dockett] Head Nurse, not Head Doctor. - [Dr. Krebs] For a nurse, you're a hell of a doctor. - [Candy striper] He's not gonna die or anything? - [Nurse Dockett] You want to do a doctor's job. - [Dr. Krebs] We'll be lucky, frankly, if she lives. - Now, you see how easy that was? - And that is what I had been paying $25 for. You know, they ought to be arrested, doctors. Bandits, all of them. You're okay kid, I gotta tell my sister about this place. Of course, she lives in Omaha. Maybe I'll send her a telegram. - Won't you tell all your friends about this place. - Yeah, I think I'm going to, it's fantastic. Wish I had known about it earlier, I'd be saving money all these years. Okay, thanks a lot. See you later. Okay. - How are things? - Looking up. How about you? - You wouldn't believe it. - Oh, Ms. Whiting? - [Chris] Yes. - I'm Lucille Anders, from the Times, we talked on the phone. - Oh yes, this is Joanne Scott, my assistant. Joanne, Ms. Anders. - How do you do? - No, Mrs. Anders. I prefer Missus. I'm not ashamed of the fact that I'm married. However, I'll be referring to you as Ms., if that's what you'd like. - Your choice, should we go in the other room? - Oh. Okay. - To tell you the truth, I got this assignment because I'm female. I'd much rather be writing about fires. - We can burn the place down if that would help. - What I'm after is a little story for the Woman's section. Something about your background, a little about your home life. - My favorite recipes? - Oh, this may turn out to be okay after all. - How about all the famous people that visit us here. The Fire Commissioner, the Board of Health, the Vice Squad. - You really are busy. - Oh, we're a regular tourist attraction. We've even been inspected by the restaurant license people for using yogurt in our treatment. - Yogurt? About the treatment-- - Hey, why don't we have a picture of you learning to examine yourself. - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, I have someone to do that. An actual gynecologist. Why don't you examine your assistant? I'm sure she wouldn't object. - Oh, no not at all. - We do have other functions here besides training women to find infection. - I'll bet you do. - We do VD tests, we have classes in birth control techniques. We have a class in natural childbirth starting next week. - That's never appealed to me. Natural childbirth is so, somehow it's unnatural. - We also have a referral service for abortions. - Where's Mchumba? Mchumba? (upbeat music) Thank you. - [Chris] You gotta be more careful what you say to people like that. - She deserved it. - Well, I didn't. She writes one good article, and maybe I'll be able to go a day or two without every inspector in LA County trying to close the place down. - You just have to keep fighting them. - That is not the way I work. - That's the only way you can work. - Look, Joanne, medicine is big business in this country and we're trying to buck it. We've gotta stay cool or they are gonna kick our heads in. - I thought you were willing to take risks. - Don't tell me what I'm willing to do. Not until you're willing to come down here and put your head in the noose with mine. Are you coming back? - I don't know. - Hi, Kitty. - [Kitty] Hi. - [Mr. Fairbanks] How are you doing, babe? It's good to see you. - Hi. I brought you something for good luck. What's the matter? - I think you know. - [Kitty] No, I don't. - Why don't you go and ask my father? - Your father? What did he-- - [Matt] He told me all about it. - Did he tell you that I stabbed him with a needle? - I thought he stabbed you. - You're kidding, he really told you that? - You did go out with him. - I wouldn't go out with your father if he were my father. Hey, take me with you. - My father has to crew for me. - Your father, huh? Is that a rule? - That's a tradition, that's more important than a rule. - Sure it is. Until you find yourself a new tradition. Come on. - You're gonna race to win? - I was racing to win when I pulled you out of the water. Please? - Come on. (victorious music) - You're gonna lose! After all I did for you! You're gonna lose! - After all he did for you, you're gonna lose. - After all he did for me, I almost did. - [Race Announcer] Sailing class ready to start. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (gunshot) All clear! (tranquil music) (sneaky music) - [Haskell] Quagrin, nope never heard of it. (exciting music) - Well, Michelle, how are you? It's a pleasure to see you. How do you feel? Lester, would you please close the door? - Told you were messing with the wrong kind of people. - You know, I'm not really angry with you. I'm only angry with those beach boys. You know, I had to get rid of them the same way, you see, that I had to get rid of you. (screaming) (groaning) - Lester, I can't let him die! - Old man had money coming in from all sides. All them medicare payments them old folks was giving to him. And he was overcharging them like crazy. It's over with now. Got Floyd on the street. Dealing this shit, shooting it in people's arms. That's going too. - That man was a goddamn tycoon. - Sure he was. - What are you? - Hey baby, I wasn't anything. I didn't even know what the stuff was until you started coming around asking questions about it. All I knew was he had an island somewhere in Baja that made a stash before they outlawed it. Found out what the stuff did, decided it was about time for him to retire. - So you planned on killing him all the time, right? - Not from the beginning, baby. Not til you came back. I figured that we might as well get that money and do it together, make a life for ourselves. Hey baby, we had some good times together. - Yeah, we did. - Will you come with me? You always did like boats. - I always did like money, you know. And I always did like you. Goodbye, Lester. - Michelle? I wasn't really asking you. I'm telling you, you're coming with me. (tranquil music) - Ready to come about. - What are you doing? - [Matt] I'm pulling out of the race. - Why? - Because I've already won. - You have, huh? - Why, don't you think I'm a winner? - Sure, I think you're a winner. - Michelle, hey I got a quarter million dollars of that old's money down there. Hey Michelle, all we gotta do is dump him out at sea. He would do it to you. Hey look, baby, there's no point in me going any place if I can't go with you. Michelle. Hey baby, I did it all for you. Michelle! Look, we've been together a long time now. Come down on me, because I was a joke. - You got a problem? - Are you crazy? We got a boat full of stolen money and a dead body onboard. - And me. - [Matt] Hey, ahoy there! - [Kitty] Are you okay? - [Michelle] You guys mind giving me a ride back? - What you going to do, leave me here by myself? - Oh now, baby, would I do that? As soon as I get back, I'm gonna call the Coast Guard to come out and rescue you, okay? Of course now, it might take a couple of hours to get to a phone, but, I think you can deal with it. Bye, baby. - [Lester] Michelle? (cheerful music) - We have the pathologist report that the patient, Mrs. Johnson. Yes, Mrs. Johnson contracted and died of septicemia as a result of a transfusion which was given her on, I don't know what the date is. May we have the first witness? - In my whole nine years here, I have not seen as many infractions of the established procedures as this young lady committed single-handed. - Just what she needs. - [Dr. Krebs] Is someone talking? This is a hearing. Continue, Nurse Dockett. - When nurses don't follow the rules, the hospital suffers. - Then when nurses do follow the rules, the patients suffer. - [Nurse Dockett] Everyone has their duties to perform, and if everyone performs their own duties, the hospital will be better off. - The important thing then is for the hospital to run smoothly? - [Nurse Dockett] An efficient hospital is a healthy hospital. My concern is with the hospital not with the individual patient. - One of the charges brought against me is that I treated a man for insulin shock without a doctor's approval. Dr. Krebs, did I try to reach you for permission? - [Dr. Krebs] Yes, you did. - That man would've been dead if I had waited for you. Now, I'd rather lose a job than lose a patient. About the cross-match-- - I think there's some testimony that needs to be heard here. - What are you doing? - I'm saving your ass. - Our friend, the nurse here, was dragged into this tribunal for one thing, ordering an unauthorized blood cross-match, yes? - [Dr. Krebs] Among others. - Well, let's just that was the one of the final straws, okay? How many cases of septicemia in this hospital since this nurse has been relieved of her duties? - Four. - Well then, it couldn't have been the procedure at all, it had to be the blood. - We ran tests on it, the whole shipment was infected. We get blood from all over. There's no way of knowing if some wino on skid row walks into a blood bank with any number of imperfections in his blood. - Why didn't you, why didn't anyone say anything about this beforehand? - I was asked not to. I was told there could be a lot of lawsuits. - Who asked you not to? - I'd rather not say. - [Joanne] You tried to cover up what you did by pinning all this on me. - Well, the board has deliberated, and we've reached a decision. Under the circumstances, we feel that you cannot be held responsible for the death of the woman. We are not pleased with your methods, but we've decided to be lenient, and we are putting you on probation for six months. - It doesn't matter. - [Dr. Krebs] I beg your pardon? - Thank you for the vote of confidence, but I have another job. When you get around to treating your nurses like human beings, and your patients like people, then you give me a call. (upbeat music) I still don't understand why didn't tell me before. Anyway, I'm a free woman. - How free? - You still make housecalls? I might need a doctor tonight. - That's one call I'll make free. - Free? Free. ♫ Nurse ♫ Can you help this man he's blue as he can be ♫ Fever's up and his health is down ♫ He needs your sympathy ♫ The doctor says it's hopeless ♫ He doubts that he'll pull through ♫ Here's your chance ♫ Just to prove what you can do ♫
