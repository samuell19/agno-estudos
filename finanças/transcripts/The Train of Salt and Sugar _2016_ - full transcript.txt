The Train of Salt and Sugar Northern Mozambique, 1988 The country has been at war for almost ten years. The government battles against armed guerrillas. Sugar is now a scarce and precious commodity. The railways are constantly sabotaged and the trains attacked. Few dare to travel to neighbouring Malawi, in the interior of the continent, to exchange salt for sugar. The wait for the train is long and silent. Old beliefs are merged with new ones aboard a train that has no scheduled time of departure. Careful. Close it. Lieutenant Taiar's in charge of the land mines. He'll take the front. Ensign Salomon will take the middle. I'll be at the back, in the head conductor's carriage. Shoot down any runaways. That's an order! Shoot the cowards in the back and leave the bodies where they fall. No burials. We'll make an example out of them. Go, go, go! Move along, move along. Careful with that baby. Departure in 30 minutes. Inform the Lieutenant and the Ensign. Danger. Inform Ensign Salomon we depart in 30 minutes. 27 minutes, you mean. It took you three just to get here. My name is Taiar, Lieutenant Taiar. I'm in charge of escorting the train. No one has been forced to be here. None of you paid for a ticket, did you? I'll protect your lives, but you'll have to obey my orders. When we stop, if the train is not under attack you only get off if you're ordered to do so. If it's under attack, jump down on the opposite side from the gunshots. Lie down on the tracks or look for shelter under the carriages. Those unable to jump off, it's OK. Just lie on your bellies until the fighting's over. Never run off into the bush. There are mines there. The enemy may be shooting from one side, but they'll be waiting for you on the other. Waiting... To capture you. The most important thing is not to be scared of the gunshot noise. It won't kill you, but fear will. Have a safe trip, everyone. Come on, son, there's no time for tears. You are a grown man. Look after your brothers. Pull away! Hello, Namina. Hello, Namina, Nampula calling. Over. Hello, Ribau�. Hello, Ribau�? No one to see you off? My family's far away, in Maputo. I've just graduated as a nurse. I've been placed at the hospital in Cuamba. Pleasure to meet you, my dear. Nampula calling... Over. This is Calisto Confian�a, Iapala station master, over. ^IThe train departed^I ^Ifrom Nampula this morning.^I ^II will send information^I ^Iregarding the train's cargo^I ^Iand military escort^I ^Ias soon as they arrive.^I Again. I shouldn't play. A Muslim that drinks can play. One more time. Praying's not enough for this trip, Commander. The drink helps. This helps more. That's not fair, Commander. The bird's not in the game. Relax. Commander, we have to work on the tracks. Rain damage. Two or three hours till we can move again. Lieutenant, the commander gave orders not to advance. But why don't they turn off the engines? So that the batteries don't go dead. The engine keeps us company. The nights seem less dangerous this way. What time do they strike? During the day or during the night? At night, so that it's a surprise. They never strike at night. They always strike early morning. But why? Maybe they want to have breakfast with us. Mrs. Mariamu... With that belly you shouldn't be going on this trip. That's true. It would be more dangerous to stay at home. I'm going to my parents. And the father? It's him I'm running away from. He says this belly isn't his doing. Once he holds the baby in his arms, you'll see he'll get over it. He will. You don't know him... When his mind is set on something, he becomes bewitched. Nothing's going to happen, the nights are quiet. - I was attacked at night once. - What's all that? Are you trying to scare Asc�nsio? They used to attack, but that was a long time ago when trains still ran in the night. Yes, there was no escort back then. You know who Asc�nsio reminds me of? Soap. Who's Soap? Soap was a veteran driver. Na�ve, pure. I was with him, next to the engine when the first attack in this area happened. It was at night. It was all very fast. No one was ready for it. And they said there was no war, just some thugs running around. We were going at about 50, on a rotten track. They started shooting, Soap picked up speed... We went off rail. And Soap? Became a martyr. One of God's creatures. He was lucky. He didn't have to see what we've seen since. What have you seen? Once, we were ambushed. They attacked the train and chopped off the heads of every single passenger they could catch and lined the tracks with them. Just left them there, staring at each other without being able to see anything. Their eyes gouged out by bayonets. Was it him? The one that can turn into a monkey? Commander Xipoco (Ghost)? Immediate departure. No radio. Why? Are they listening in? Not the enemy... But the spirits protecting them. Wake up. Let's get to work. Wait, I'll help you. - Lieutenant, will there be an attack? - No, there will be no attack. If there's an attack, what'll happen to us? Don't worry, we're here to protect the train, alright? Everything will be fine. Come here, I'll help you. Why don't they turn on the lights? What for? So we become an even easier target? We're moving so slowly. The order's not to go over five kilometres per hour. The rules also state not to travel during the night. Faster! Right here. Stop and turn on the light, now! Commander's orders. Get off, get off! Get to work, come on. Quickly. We have to be fast. Faster! What are you waiting for? Faster! You? Where are you going with that belly? Back to your wagon. Lazy asses get whipped! Do you want me to pray out loud, to keep you awake? Do something. I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. The only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages, God of God, Light of Light true God from true God... The train arrived this morning at Namina where it will stay for the night. I don't have the other information yet. You know, I don't know. I'm not even sure my husband's dead. He went missing during an attack on his village. He went there to visit his mother. Two years without any news from him. I chose to start calling him deceased. I put my affairs in order. Now I travel with the military to Mozambique Island. There I buy the salt and wait for the train back to Nampula. Do you realise that with 15 bags of salt, I get 20-something bags of sugar in Malawi? And I return to sell the sugar in Nampula, where you can't find it even for tea. But have you never considered the risk? Don't you think it's worse like this? The children being left without a mother? Not knowing where she was buried? My dear, thinking too much gives you a headache and won't fill your belly. I did the math. You know how much a kilo of sugar's going for in Nampula? And salt? It's almost free. Pity you can't use it for tea. You can't do that. You're here to guard the train. You're not supposed to touch the cargo inside! Careful old man. The next time there's an attack, the first bullet is for you. I am the head conductor of this train. If there's any cargo missing, I'll state in the report that you two stole it. Your name, soldier? Bayonet. I asked for your name. - I told you, Bayonet. - Easy. Let the old man go. He's with the commander. This coach is ours. The whole train is ours. You, come here. You'll cook for me. Me? Not me. Women can't say no, you hear me? I won't cook for you. I'm not your wife. Get on, damn it! Do you need help, Ensign? I'll help you if you need it. Lieutenant, when it comes to women, no one orders me around. I earned my stripes in the war. Ten years! I have a right to any woman I want. Women are not the enemy, Ensign. They can't be taken captive. Let go of her. I didn't know you wanted her for yourself. By all means. A lieutenant has priority. You can have her. There are others lying around. Fuck her till she breaks! That's what I was going to do! Stay in your corner and don't start any more trouble, OK? Herculano, get me some tea, a strong one. No one had the guts to intervene. Only the lieutenant. Look at this. Now it won't close. Well, what can you do when you're facing a gun? The soldiers are in charge. Calm down, child. There's no point. You'll only attract more problems. - You were lucky, in fact. - Lucky? Not even a child is safe here. Salomon is a thug. He raped a 12-year-old girl, right here in this station. The mother heard her screaming and she said, No! My daughter doesn't know how to do this! She doesn't know how to do that! If you weigh 30 kilos you're a woman, they say. Soldiers... They're like children. Violent children. But that Salomon is the boss. Stay away from them and don't look at them. I'm not a child to have to keep my head down. They are the children, girl. You're a plaything, don't you understand? Hello, Mrs. Mariamu. How are you? I noticed you were here with us. I haven't had the opportunity to say hello. It's OK. There's so much to do... So many problems to solve. What are the troops having for dinner tonight? Dried fish and porridge, same as always. Rosa, I want to introduce you to Lieutenant Taiar. Lieutenant, have you met nurse Rosa? Yes... We have porridge with black-eyed peas. It's almost ready. Will the lieutenant have supper with us? I shouldn't, but I'll take it. I'm sick of eating around men all the time. This fucking lieutenant doesn't even seem like military. He's always against us. A soldier like that can compromise a mission. That Lenin may just as well be in cahoots with the enemy. Infiltrated. He just wants to lower our morale. Imagine that. Stopping us from mobilising women. Our women! Lieutenant, Lieutenant. Just because he went to a Russian academy in the Ukraine... You learn war in the bush! And in those Lenin's country, above all. Marxists with titles. Ridiculous. Down with academics. Down with that Lenin. Pass me the bottle. It's prime stuff. Pass it over? Money. Shut up, Danger. What money? How much did you pay for it? I paid in kicking his ass. Can you imagine that in the middle of all this shit, the guy wanted money? Damn. Next week I'll be 40 years old. I want a party. A big party. I have five more years to live. My ancestors told me so. Five more years. Damn. And we could be dead tomorrow. I'll devour those five years. War or no war. Fucking hell. He was born this way. Always sick. In Cuamba, there's a hospital where I'll be working. We can treat him there. We're going back home. We'll only be able to take care of him there. Why only there? That's where we were born. That's where he should have been born to have the protection of his ancestors. That's why he's always sick. But the healer from our land will take care of him. The hospital can take care of him as well. The healer will take care of him. I understand. My family has good healers as well. I was shot in the leg. Ten kilometres, bleeding, lost in the bush, do you know what that's like? Nothing's going to happen. I only got to the hospital on day three. And on the fourth day you resurrected. Caravel, I know that story by heart, man. Pray, I'd rather hear you pray. Pray. This is the commander. Stop the train. Stop immediately. They screwed up the tracks. Careful! Careful! Careful! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Motherfuckers! Communists! Don't waste ammo. They're running away. So, Adriano, how does it look? It still works, Lieutenant. 700 metres of destroyed tracks. The tracks are out there, spread out in the bush. And the ties, Commander? They set them on fire, but many didn't burn. We'll need three or four days' work. Two! I want it done in two. Put everyone to work. We can work in peace today. They won't attack soon. Herculano! Bring nurse Rosa to my carriage. She can take better care of the wounded there. With Mrs. Mariamu's help, of course. Hello, Ribau�. Hello, Ribau�. D67 calling, over. D67 calling, over. You. Drop that. You stay here. You, carry on. Is it because of the baby, boss? I don't explain myself to civilians. And take the child. He'll get in the way. Go get a pan to cook for me. You, go. Get lost. Get lost or you'll get a beating! 200 metres of tracks in one day. We need to go faster. If I find out that anyone is in cahoots with the enemy, holding up work on purpose, I won't waste a bullet on him. I'll have him gutted. Tomorrow we start at five. You hear me? I'll say to God, do not condemn me; Let me know why you contend against me. - Comrade Commander. - Yes, speak. Since today is Sunday, may I ask you to pray with the other believers? - When the work is done. - God bless you, Comrade Commander. Commander. The monkeys are very close. I can smell them. Alert! Turn the piece around! They're coming from the other side! Take shelter! Take aim! Hurry! Hurry, Amelia! Lie down. You're OK. I need more water. I'll bring some of mine. God is wise of heart, And mighty in strength He who removes mountains, in surprise, when he overturns them in His anger. He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble. He commands the sun, and it doesn't rise, and seals up the stars. He alone stretches out the heavens... They abandoned the camp they had erected to wait for us. They pulled back? I saw a lot of blood and found a large ditch. They pulled back, that's it. They had a lot of casualties. He changed tactics, he'll be waiting further ahead. We all know the commander will get him. Old monkeys don't step on dry twigs. It won't be easy getting my hands on him. Even for those who had powerful ancestors who knew how to prepare the spears so that they always hit the lion in the heart? And who inherited... Even for this one. The lion cannot divert spears, the man who transforms into a monkey can. But he's still just a man. He'll be waiting further ahead. You can be sure of that. It won't be as easy as it was here. Today we can rest. Tomorrow, Ribau�. This is D67 head conductor Omar, over. Hello, Ribau�. Hello, Ribau�. This is D67 head conductor Omar, over. I can't get through to them. We're so close, they should be able to hear us. But I'll keep trying. Good afternoon. Seems like the comrade lieutenant likes our food. I'm not here for food. I need your help. Mariamu, where are you going? There. You spilled it, you don't get any more. It's your fault. Next. There. Nurse Rosa needs water to tend to the wounded. Look, there's no exceptions here. There. Next! Quickly. Don't let it get dirty. Why didn't you visit the combat medic sooner? There wasn't time. You're like a child. It could have gotten infected. But it didn't. Everything must seem beautiful from up there. Those are the Namuli Hills. They reach about 2000 metres high. They say the first Makua came down from these hills. Where I'm going, in Cuamba, there's the Metucu� Hills. Hundreds of people moved there at the beginning of World War Two. My grandfather told me. He lived there. At that time, people thought World War II was the end of the world. So they took shelter on high ground. There's always water up there. Anything that's sowed grows well. I wanted to be an agriculturist. When I finished high school, they drafted me to the military. It seems like the country needed to be defended more than it needed to be fed. I always wanted to be a nurse. I used to tell my father that I wanted a beautiful white coat. Metucu� Hills. I'd like to live in a place like that. One that has water and no war. I thought soldiers liked war. That's the same as saying that all nurses like diseases. Down with Communists Commander Xipoco was here Go, go, go! It's getting cold. I'm going to get a shawl. Let's go. Spy? Spy! Boss. I need my wife. It's nothing, boss. Just, our son needs to eat. I'm asking, boss. Danger, Bayonet. Whip his ass. No! No! Maybe he was just a farmer returning to his old farms to search for food. I'm sorry, but I have to tend to this. OK. Go on, I'll handle it. They take your wife and children, and then what do you do? Nothing. You turn informer. You pick apart tracks and do whatever they tell you to do. It's the same thing that happens on our side. Sometimes those defending us are worse than the ones attacking. Then it's the same as it was in the time of my grandparents, with the colonialists. It's not quite like that, child. You're too young to know how it was. Maybe you wouldn't even have been able to study to be a nurse. Before, we didn't have a future. Now we can think about having one. If the war ever ends, of course. The important thing is to stay alive. I'm right. It doesn't have to be this way. If you want to survive this trip, you need to have your eyes wide open. My eyes are wide open. Then maybe you need to close them. I saw the commander kill someone in cold blood. He's worse than the ones attacking us. What does a nurse from the city know? You don't know anything. You don't take prisoners. If we let them loose, they will go back and warn the enemy. And is he the enemy to be treated this way? I don't know what he did or did not do. He didn't do anything. They took his wife from him. Then it's up to her to press charges. Against Ensign Salomon? Why don't you do something? It's not up to me to denounce the ensign. You protect each other. You're all the same. What do you know about war? About those that lived through it? Commander. This stretch is tricky. I'll go on ahead alone on the second locomotive. When I confirm that everything is OK, I'll give the order over the radio to advance. I didn't inform you before because I just thought about it now. I heard a bird singing. It wasn't his time. They only ever sing at dawn. Better to take more men with you. Commander? What is this shit? I don't want that on the train. It has an owner, even if he ran away. Put it down, now. Put it down, now! Our commander's up ahead, but he doesn't run the train. My men are authorised to take anything they find. Is that so? So that they don't leave it behind for the enemy. I want to see this in writing, in the military rules. In writing? Out here you write with bullets. Excuse me, Lieutenant. Careful, Salomon. Careful. This is the commander. Answer. Over. This is the commander. Order to advance. Greetings, comrade colleagues. - So, how was the trip? - The usual. With God's help. And maybe the devil's too? Don't talk like that about the commander. Welcome, Commander. We're so happy with the train's arrival that we'd like you to accept these three chickens as a gift. Go. Quickly, quickly. Go get the brandy for the commander. I'm forbidden to take a stranger's gifts. The chickens, one's for Taiar, one's for Salomon, and the other's for you. I still have a little bit of sugar left from the last train from Malawi. Yes. But tell me, how are the tracks between Iapala and Malema? Well, one of the wire guards saw some movement. But that was days ago. Nothing important. Sorry, boss. That wasn't days ago. It was actually just two days ago. And there were a lot of people, well-armed. The day before yesterday? The days last longer here. But when was this, really? Just before yesterday. Before yesterday? Think nothing of it. Listen, Omar, you need to understand that here, in Iapala, we have a good garrison, day and night. These bandits can't come in. Anyway, I'd still be afraid of sleeping here. - Why? - In the same place? Always? After what we saw in Ribau�? Your commander? Seven Ways. That's his name? No one knows his name. Curious individual, isn't he? He's so full of himself, speaks of strange things, doesn't he seem to you to have a loose screw? Nothing like that. Nothing like that, please. Careful. He may be listening. If he wants to he'll appear out of thin air, just like that. He might even already be here as we speak. How many spoons? One and a half. Good afternoon, old man. How much for the chicken? 30 is too much! And the corncob? How much is it? Chicken drafted. Now we'll find some babes to pluck their feathers. To raise the troops' morale. Thank you. At this rate, by the time you reach Malawi you'll have nothing left to sell. With water running out, two kilos of salt for 40 litres of water is nothing, honey. Don't make a fuss, that's worse. Let me check the list. Boss, mine was the last cargo to be loaded. Those were my bags of salt in there. But they're not there! They didn't take anything else. Just his bags, just that. Now, don't gather around here. Go away, there's nothing else to see. Commander, there's been a serious lack of discipline on this escort. Now there's even thieving. The soldiers are threatening and beating up civilians. Civilians need to respect the military. Respect is good, my commander, fear is not. If he's against us, he's an enemy. - Even if he is against the enemy? - Even so. Whenever the enemy attacks, he screams, The military ruin your wives. Isn't it true that we're raping married women here? A man is a man. A woman is a woman. It's normal that on a trip such as this, these things happen. It's normal that they happen, my commander. But always the same people making it happen? Salomon is a decorated soldier. Is it normal for a soldier to threaten a civilian with death, just to take his wife? Then the civilian loses all respect. Only fear remains, Commander. Back then, they used to say that the people were water, and the military were the fish. Now the water's dried up. The people are against the enemy, but also against us, the ones that should defend them. Threatening isn't good. For every female, two men fight. But when one has teeth, claws and horns and the other doesn't, that's not a fight, Commander. It's a massacre. Excuse me. So? You can speak, I'm listening. What's the complaint? Nothing. My wife's here. She just went out for a walk with him. But she's here now. You have nothing else to say? No. Then leave. Excuse me. Fuck. I know it was you. You fuck up and I'm to blame? There was no point in saying anything. I played the fool. That man, he had very little left in him. He was no longer a man. You showed you were different. You did your bit. I also kill. And I order beatings, just like everyone else. This country is incredible. It has good people. But the war turns the bad worse. The weak get weaker. The cowards more cowardly. Brothers against brothers, not knowing why they fight. We got our independence, but now we're trapped in an endless war. It started by being something, now it's something else entirely. And the big leaders, them! They're fighting for power. The ones taking orders, like us, all they do is gnaw the bush. No time to do anything of worth with their lives. Comrade, don't discuss politics. Our politics is to survive until we reach our destination. So, comrade? Aren�t you going to eat your chicken? I made it myself. I guarantee this chicken's innocent. It's got no woman's spell to capture a man. The train departed at 6am. 50-man escort. One anti-aircraft, two locomotives. One water tank, one cargo container. Commander Seven Ways. Satan. A head! A monkey's head? A man's head. God be praised. It's Florindo! Xipoco did it... Welcome to hell! Let's inaugurate a new train station Hell Station. It's him. It's Commander Xipoco. He turned into a monkey to spy on us. You're going crazy and you're driving me nuts instead of helping me! It's not one of God's creatures, it's the devil. Caravel, shut up! In the name of every saint, in the name of Christ who was sacrificed for us, be gone! Return to the bottom of hell, Satan! Fuck the monkey. Fuck it, you hear me? Do you see? Do you see that smoke up ahead? That's the devil. The fucking devil. Commander, this is Taiar, over. Commander? This is Taiar, over. Work carefully. This one will come soon. He's changing his position. You should have him at home. This is no place for a child to be born. It wouldn't be any good there either. The important thing is that he's born. That's right, Amelia. The important thing is that he's born. No place is perfect. No moment. No person. Those that wait for everything to be perfect, wind up letting opportunities go by. The weapons I captured from the dead enemy. There are kilometres of ruined tracks. Their commander, Xipoco, the one who's been writing those signs, he's a fat man with a black uniform. He has two pistols and grenades on his belt. He has good boots. The one who kills him can keep them. I need some new boots. Spread the word. I want that monkey truly dead. We'll attack! Before we're attacked. If we go, we leave the train unprotected. Stuck here, we're in danger. They're about 100, well-armed. I counted five bazookas, two 60 mortars, one 80. Three pieces. This is serious business. So, gentlemen? How's it going? We lost a lot of water from the radiator. We'll have to add about 300 litres. Lieutenant. They didn't fill it up in Iapala. The cistern's empty. They filled it. I saw it! The fact is we're out of water. That's the truth. Sons of bitches. Let's go. None of this would have happened if we had done what I said. Commander, let's go back and kill the traitors. Is this always your solution? To go back and kill everyone? My commander, our problem now is water. We need to send the message: Traitors die. Starting with the station master. I'm sorry, Commander... Speak. Malema is still very far away. I think it's best to go back and get water. They're putting in a lot of work trying to keep us here. Tomorrow, at dawn, when the enemy isn't expecting it, you'll go back to Iapala and bring water. Without water, we're stuck here. At your orders, Commander. Request all the water you can find on this train. The enemy mustn't know about our problem so the locomotive needs to keep moving. At your orders, Commander. Everything's ready. You can go. If you're late, you'll be stuck. We're running out of ties so we'll start removing them from the back to place them in front of the train. At your orders, Commander. Iapala calling, over. 67, over. This is driver Asc�ncio. Inform the commander that we've restocked and we're coming back. What, are you under attack? No. The ensign did not identify the saboteur. He's shooting everyone down! This is the cistern car. Urgent! This is D67, over. Identify yourself. Who's operating the radio? Over. This is Salomon. Ensign Salomon. We request immediate backup. We request immediate backup. That's not Salomon. He wouldn't ask for help. I didn't order you to stop! The shooting is none of your concern. Slackers and saboteurs get beaten. Get to work! You and your soldiers take position at the front under Lieutenant Taiar's orders. Afterwards, make a report. You there, move! Quickly. Come on, come on. Commander, I saw it on the map. There's a lake near here. Later when it's dark I can send out a group of people to fetch water. It might have dried out by now though. I don't think they'll attack again today. Tomorrow they'll attack harder. Get the water. At your orders, Commander. There! You need to get it done faster. The work ends there. We'll rest in Malema! It's almost done! Land mine! This water's good enough for the locomotive. Come on, fill up your buckets. Fill up the buckets! Come on. Hurry, hurry. Let's finish it. Faster, faster. My ancestors forbade me from entering either sea or river water. I want to wear my other uniform. Miracle! Mira... Push. Push! Just a little bit more. Push! A chicken eats on the ground! Shoot the ground! Beautiful Amelia! Come with me? The other day I was nervous. I shouldn't have said what I said. That was a lifetime ago. Let's go to the river. Taiar, let's stay here. I'm scared. You don't need to be scared, Rosa. Let's go over there, where the river runs deeper. Are you ever afraid? Of course, just like everyone else. But never in combat. We were trained for that. When are you scared? When I have a nightmare I cannot recall. Or when I think of a future I cannot picture. But you can't picture it because you don't have a family. You don't have children. Children only with you. Maybe you're already getting the first. Come here. I want to believe in the future. Hail, hail, hail Mary, Hail, hail, hail Mary. The little lieutenant's feeding you chicken? Let go of me. You whore, I'll feed you lamb if you want it. You're not worth it, but I'll give it to you! Let go. I'll take care of the lieutenant and keep you all to myself. For free! You'll be Salomon's woman. Before this journey's over, you'll be my woman. You will. Don't go near Rosa again. Have a drink with us. This is our brother, the commander here. That's Lieutenant Taiar. A strategy and tactics type lieutenant. He went to the military academy. Next time you go near Rosa, I will kill you. Threats? You're threatening me? I'm not a man who takes threats. Later I'll have someone bring you the gun. Get me another drink! Careful! They killed our Commander Xipoco. - Victory! - We killed the Commander Xipoco! The lieutenant killed Xipoco! Victory! Amelia? Rosa. So the spirits lied to him after all. It wasn't five years. It was five days. The gunshot didn't kill him. Some fucker came by, found him wounded and finished the job with a knife. Go get a shovel. Leave him there. He doesn't deserve a grave. I tried. I tried. Try not to move. I'm here. These belonged to the commander the lieutenant killed. He deserves them for his bravery. They are worth more than some tin medal. I dreamed of raising ox, taking care of the farm. But all I did was hunt men down. I see mount Metucu�. When the war's over we'll go up there. You will go alone. I can't see anything. I want to see mount Metucu�. Help me. I'm seeing it. Go, my dear. Courage. - Thank you. - Good luck. Let's go. The fight goes on.
