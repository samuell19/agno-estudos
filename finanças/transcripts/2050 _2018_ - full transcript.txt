Take one. What are you worried about? I'm not worried about anything. I'm just hungry. Why are we here now? I didn't know mechanics were open this late. We changed the oil right here three months ago. - I wasn't with you. - Where were you? With the kids, I don't know. You're not nervous? What do I have to be nervous about? The mechanic's gonna find something wrong with the car? You heard me tell Pete, "Just change the oil." The neighbor girl's gonna forget to feed the kids? Cindy may be a little loopy, but she's not a ditz. What are you... That's the same thing. Don't you have any change? Go get something to eat. The machine out there works? Yes, I don't know. Go see. I'm not that hungry. Is there a particular time your brother's expecting us? I am hungry, I just figure I'll wait if it's not gonna be that long. I think I'm just restless. Today, the TSA has issued a statement addressing the states proposal for drone traffic regulations. Drone delivery companies are now required to regulate speeds to under 20 miles per hour. - I'm worried about him. - Why? I don't think he gets out much. Should the check oil light still supposed to be on? I told you it's always on. You told me, but did you tell the mechanic? That's why he's there. Yeah, I told him like two times ago. It's not doing any harm. Well, it's weird and annoying. We just came from his place... Michael, you don't drive this car, so who cares? Please, just drive. So, is this a fancy dinner party we're going to? Should we bring a bottle of wine, dessert? Why don't you remember people's names? The mechanic's name is Pete. Is that so hard to remember? Maybe something fancy like a Sherry. - A nice port. - Oh shit, we missed it. Turn around, we missed it. What did we miss? Shun Lee Palace, we're getting Chinese food. Are you kidding me? There's no dinner party, is there? Just us bringing your brother dinner again - like a couple of assholes. - Oh, god, please. You love Chinese food. - Yeah, I love Chinese food. - He, he loves Chinese food. We're going to see him, so what matters is that - he loves Chinese food. - He loves Chinese food? He does not love the drop in. No one loves a drop in... - It's not a drop in. - Least of all, - your little brother. - Well, he knows, he knows we're coming, don't worry. Bullshit, I call bullshit. I bet you $100 right now he has no idea we're dropping by. Jesus, I'm coming. What the hell? "What the hell?" Don't "what the hell" to me. What, I can't drop in to see my little brother? Sorry, I didn't know it was a drop in. Who cares if it is a drop in? I can stop by to see my little bro. What are you, a hot shot now, Mr. Wall Street? What am I on suicide watch? You couldn't just pick up the phone and say, "Hey Drew, how are you today?" "How are you feeling?" "Have you gotten over the girl" "that ditched you for an eMate yet?" Oh, don't even dare remind me about that sexbot. Sexbot? Wow, you are old school. They're eMates, Brooke, and how are you going to blame a machine on the end of my relationship? Listen, you are a fool for thinking that I give a shit about a machine with an artificial heart that walks around stealing human souls. Okay, can we get back to the reason you're here right now? I have plans, you know. Masturbating to a video game? - That can wait, can't it? - Brooke, come on. What, does he look like he's going out? Whether I go out or not is my business. I can still have plans. I brought you your favorite, Kung Pao chicken with a shrimp egg roll and a Coke. - From Shun Lee Palace? - Yeah. - They're good. - Did you see my white rice? Did you get white rice? Yes, because I always get white rice. Keep looking then. I'm looking, and I'm not seeing it. Maybe they screwed up. Well, it's not here. Yeah, they screwed up. Goddammit. Just treat this as your me meal. - Have some fried rice. - No, because it's gross and greasy and disgusting. Baby, what, what are you doing here? Hi, Sugar, what's keeping you? Um, my sister popped in. - Uninvited. - How lovely. No, it's not lovely at all actually, because we had those plans, um, that we were going to go out. So, great, let's go out all together. We can, we can go to the movies. But then you had to lie down and rest in peace and quiet. Yes, it got much worse. I had come out for some fresh air. For a headache. You just take a drop of honey, stir it in a glass of water. No water. Well, no, don't be ridiculous 'cause we're mostly made of water, so you could just be dehydrated. But it's the honey that does the trick. - You got some honey? - No, no, no. Just put some water on the towelette... Please, please, stop, stop. I took something, and I drank plenty of water. See, she took something already. You know, pharmaceuticals are bad for the body. Sorry, um, what's your name? I'll handle this, just go rest on the bed, will you? Thanks. I was trying to tell you. No, you were not trying to tell me anything. I thought it was obvious that I didn't want you to stay. Yeah, there is a woman in your apartment, and you don't have the common decency to tell me that you're seeing somebody? Okay, not everything is your business. Are you guys an item? You know, get yourself some raw, organic honey. You'll never go to the drug store again. - I can't. - Okay, look. I really appreciate the food, but obviously I'm doing fine. Lavender oil. - That works well, too. - Just, just... Obviously you're not fine, because you're not telling me anything about her, and for all I know she could be a fling. Okay, you know what, it doesn't matter what she is to me. She could be a fling, a roommate, my eloped wife, or an escort. It wouldn't justify you barging in here uninvited. Drew? What, why are we whispering? Yo, dude. Your friend. Yeah, oh right. The headache. Yeah. Here. Eat. So. She's an escort. I'm just kidding. No one can tell when you're kidding. Yeah, that's the point. No, kidding is supposed to be playful and innocent. - Yeah, that's what I do. - No, you do it wrong. Do you get headaches often? I don't know. It's up to Drew. And how is that? He's in charge, whatever he says goes. I don't think you're hearing me right. - Are you a doctor? - No. I just like to study the human body. How it works, how it heals itself. I'm actually in video game development. Started my own company. I guess you can say I'm into creating artificial life. What a coincidence. - That's my entire existence. - Oh, really? - You're a gamer? - Somewhat. I'm mostly into stimulation, but also entertainment in general. You mean simulation. Yeah, just go ahead and pull your hair to the side for a second. Yeah, try one more thing. Okay, ready? A little pressure there, might hurt. Holy shit. Holy shit. Oh shit! - You stay there. - Shit! What, what's happening? Okay, stay calm and don't panic. That's a sexbot. - EMate. - She's a sexbot! It's a computer! Guys, what's going on? - Nothing, it's just a... - It's a bug. Big bug, it scared Quin, and she yelled. - That was Michael who yelled. - Big fuckin' bug, Brooke. Oh, gross. Please don't tell my sister. What the hell, man! She's not going to understand, and she's gonna be on my ass forever. I'm not making any guarantees, I wanna get out of this room. You can't leave unless you promise me. Fuck, she looks so real. - She is real. - No, real, like a, like a human. Okay I got it. I will put $10,000 into your company if you promise not to tell Brooke about Quin. Who's Quin. Oh, yeah, right. So, are you guys killing it? Well? You'll invest 10K in the company? Yeah, of course. I like what you guys are doing anyway. Shake on it? Deal. Now will you please persuade your wife to get the hell out of my apartment? Yeah, I think I can do that. Oh fuck. Brooke. Brooke. We got to go. I'm sorry, she's throwing up in there. - I don't... - There's... There's just too much going on right now. Yeah, the migraines, and it's really gross. - Come on, we got to go. - Talk to your friend. Yeah, we'll talk to her later, we'll give her a get wall card, come on. - Enjoy the Chinese, thank you. - Call me. She'll call you. You call me. You call me. Why does Brooke talk different? She was adopted. Let's go back to bed. You want to fool around tonight? - Eh, it depends. - Oh, it depends? Yeah, let's see if the kids will go to bed. If not, maybe they can watch a movie. Well we can do something. It's still early. We have the neighbor girl till 10, right? Go see a movie. Go get dessert somewhere. Have a drink. Was there something weird about that girl? Quin. - Quin? - Quin. That's her name? Yeah, Quin. So, was there something weird? Yeah. I mean, there was something. I can't put my finger on it. Something weird. Whatever he's doing is not healthy. I think I'm going see him more often and take him out of that apartment. Quin? Weird. How come you remember her name, you only saw her for like 20 seconds. You don't even remember the name of the girl who's watching our kids? Or the guy who is taking care of our cars? Michael It's a unique Name. Quin, I don't know. That's the place. And what is this? It's a manufacturing parlor. Dude, how old are you? Parlor's aren't new. - EMates have been around. - Yeah, I'm not that old dude. I've just never hung out with one. Or had sex with one. Right. Well, don't tell my sister you're researching eMates. I don't care that it's for the new game you're developing, don't even mention Butterfly Chasers. Don't let her find that card. She'll fuckin' kill you, research or not. So you can own one? Own, lease, rent, whatever. It's like a car. A smart car. They're programmed to know what you want, exactly what's expected of them. They're complete subordinates. But they don't complain, they don't argue, they don't manipulate, they just love. Unless you want them to complain, or argue, or manipulate you. Because you can program them. You program them? Well, the manufacturer. I'm sure it's way too complicated for the average consumer. For them, it's easy. I can call BC up right now and ask for a new program for Quin if I wanted. A new personality. A new voice, even. They just open their laptop, login, switch it out. That's it. You can understand all that. Your industry is all about technology. So, hold on, so, are you saying that there are sexbots just like walking around, like moving in the public? I mean, not a ton, but yeah, they're out there. And most of them are supervised. Supervised? Yeah, man, there are rules. Okay, like what? Come on, it's like obvious stuff. Your eMate can't handle money, at least not in public. They can't apply for a job. They're not supposed to be unsupervised, although, that can be kind of hard to follow when you're role playing. You wanna do some research, man? Check out the parlor. It's kind of on the down low, because of some people like my sister. Okay, but, Butterfly Chasers, what does... What's that got to do with sexbots? Think about it. What's it feel like when you first meet someone you really like? I don't know. Feels like butterflies in your stomach, doesn't it? Yeah, right. Michael, they're eMates, not sexbots. Get the lingo, man. Get the lingo. I'm not lying. Dude, you always lie to me. Why wouldn't you be lying to me now? Because I'm telling you, it's true. It's not true. What's true is you're a douche. Yeah, yeah, that might also true but in this particular situation, why can't both of them be true? They can be, but they aren't. My fuckin' ex is not in the United States, so there's no fuckin' way that you saw her at the movies. Ah, except that I did see her. I saw her in plain sight, with her arm around her eMate chimp. So she didn't go to Paris? She went to the movies instead, with Cameron, is that right? Look, it was her and Cameron alright. I know that fricking sexbot from anywhere. You remember you made me stalk them for like a week straight? So, shit, wait, you're fuckin' serious? - She was at IFC with Cameron? - Yes, I'm serious. Look, man, I'm sorry, but what am I supposed to do, not tell you, lie to you, come on. So, what, she lied to me to break up with me? Eh, I mean, not necessarily. Maybe, uh... Maybe she lost her scholarship. Fuck, maybe she just hated Paris, who knows. Maybe she came back for Cameron. That's fucking gross. Jesus, you think... You think she's in love with a fuckin' machine? Why not, he's perfect. Fuck. All right, all right, well, you get me Chinese food for a week, and I'll find out what's going on. Get the fuck out of here. Your lazy ass ain't doing shit. You're just gonna sit here all week and make up a story at the end. What, fuck you. - Fuck your mother. - Really? I'm gonna go fuck your sister. I'm gonna get her number, hold up. - Hey. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Look, seriously, though. You get me tickets to Tokyo's Revenge this month, and I'll find out what's going on with your ex, I swear. They're playing here? Yeah, they're playing here, man. - Who you going with? - Fuck you, asshole. Hey. Unless your sister's available, of course. Fuck off. These are great. I mean, you're nailing it, the... The detail in the clothes, it's like a hard casing. These are ready to go digital. - Yeah? - Yeah. - This is phenomenal Reign. - Well, great. That's what we talked about. I got to come clean. I'm struggling a little bit with some of the storylines. All right, and I thought I'd have little more for you this week, but, I don't. I mean, we have people interested in our concept. I know. - Two different companies. - I know. Got windows wide open for us. Rei. The gaming industry doesn't just sit around and wait for the next best thing. It scoops up and shits out the bottom-feeders. You don't have to tell me that. If we don't act fast, they're just gonna go with another concept. Stupider, shittier, ridiculously - fucking inferior concepts. - Look, I'm not an idiot. You don't have to tell me any of this, okay. I can't help that I'm blocked. It's not like I'm not trying. Do we need to bring on another story person? No. You sure? Trust me, you don't want the headache. What headache? I've been there before, okay. We bring out another story person, they tear apart everything that works for us so far. Plus, we have to negotiate terms, ownership rights, I have to like them. I mean, it'll take longer to recruit someone than if I... Alright, alright, alright. Now I have the headache we don't want. I'm sorry, all right, I'm holding us up. Is it the kids? Family life? Eh, that's part of it. - Is it Brooke? - It's nothing. I don't know what it is. I know, Brooke and I went to school together, but we're not as close as we used to be. I promise you, we don't around and gossip about you behind your back. You got to talk about something. What, the two times a year I see her? - Yeah, so you say. - Right. So, our whole company is just a rouse so I can spy on you when you're not home. She pays me very well, too. Speaking of money, I got more capital. 10K from the brother-in-law. What, Baby Drew, 21-year-old stockbroker genius? Yeah, he's 25 now, and he still doesn't know what to do with his money. We don't need more investment. I know. I know. We need the story. Oh, shit. What are you doing? I wanna play something. What? I don't normally hold auditions after dark. But I can see that you're very passionate about being our voice actor, so. I'm gonna give you a chance to prove yourself. All of our associates have left for the evening, so I hope you don't mind that it's just you and I. Amber, is it? Well, Amber, shall I tell you what it is that we're looking for? Yes, please, Mr. Executive. You know I will do anything. Well we're currently offering $50,000 a contract, and we're developing three games. Now, we need to cast our lead voice actress very quickly, so I'll get straight to the point. If you want this job, you're going to have to do some things. I would do anything. Come on, Brooke, it's not that funny. Michael, I don't want to do this. - Come on, just try. - I can't act. Just do it like in a different voice, - or something. - I am trying. I'm just going to laugh again. Do you want me to just lie here and say nothing? No, I want you to be engaged. - Where is that coming from? - I don't know. I just want to try something new, something different. Honey, I'm sorry, but it's not me, and it's not for you either, it's not us, it's hokey. And distracting, and I can't get turned on like that. Yeah, you can't get turned on my be. No baby. I am attracted to you. You, not some executive with a big wallet. Come on. I'm sorry, what did you come by for again? Just to talk. You wanna see Quin, don't you? No. Not unless you're offering. No. I guess I just need to go somewhere to clear my head. Okay. Leaving so soon, Mr. Green? How do you know my name? What are you looking for? I don't know, I was just looking. Are you looking' for a friend? You mean like a robot that, - you know. - A companion. Can I have an evening friend. An eMate. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm, no, I'm not looking for... Well, which one is it, yes or no? Did you come in here for an evening mate, - or you just come to gawk? - I wasn't gawking, I was just, I was... Well, I was curious. Well, why didn't you say so? There's no harm in asking questions. Come, sit down. Take a look at what we got. Explore. Ask about the specials, because there's new technology popping up all the time. Conversation is free. And you don't even have to buy your date a drink. Where is this? Mr. Chow. Fuck. Yeah. Wait, did you bring the... Bring the Chinese food? Bring my Kung Pao chicken? She always went for the classier shit. - Fuckin' Mr. Chow. - Yeah. She always raved about this place. Handmade, tossed noodles or some shit. You should have taken her. I'm not paying out the ass for some fucking noodles. It's not just the noodles, man. It's the fucking, you know, it's the music, and it's the decor and it's the ambiance and all that shit. It's special, and fucking chicks dig that shit. - Yeah, I guess so. - They want you to buy them flowers that are just gonna die in a couple days, and they want you to take them on vacations that are just gonna tire them out, and want you to have a big fucking dick on you that's gonna hurt when you try to shove it in them. But, but they want you to be the soft, sentimental guy that remembers birthdays and anniversaries, and shit. But then again, if you're in a bar, and some dude looks at her funny, they want you to be tough enough to start a fight. Crazy, they want everything, man. It's like they have this fucking idealistic perfect view of what a man should be in their fricking heads, and it's... It's, you know, it's no wonder fucking Diana ran off with that... Whatever. What? That's it, man, they just want everything. No, you were saying, no wonder Di ran off. - With Cameron? - Yeah, yeah. - But whatever, man. - No, you mean with Cameron. That's why she ran off with Cameron because he's an eMate. Because he's programmed to be perfect. Okay, yeah. So, so I mean, how are you supposed to compete with that? How are we supposed to compete if this is the world that we live in? I think I understand. I know why she dumped me. Because I'm not perfect. Yeah, dude, no shit. What have we been talking about this whole time. I know how I can win her back. No, no, stop, don't start... I can win her back by being better. No, you're gone dude, this is it. I'm changing the subject right now. We're gonna talk about food, let's get some food. - You hungry? - I'm serious. If you can reprogram a machine to be compatible with you, then you can reprogram a person. I can win her back by being better. Better than a machine? Well, if not better, at least as close as humanly possible. Come on, man, look, Cameron is a machine, and machines can be perfect. Humans can't be perfect. I disagree. I don't know that machines can be perfect, and I don't know that humans can't be. But I can be better. Better, huh? Fuck it, I'll bite, what are we talking about? No offense, man, but I didn't do anything but play video games, eat junk food, and fuck my robot. Sounds pretty, oh shit, by the way, did you bring the Kung Pao chicken or what? Are you listening to me? I just told you how I can win her back. - Forgot the food, didn't you? - Jesus Christ, man. I'll get your fuckin food, you immature infant. I just wish you could appreciate this moment I'm having. It's hard for me to appreciate things on such an empty stomach. Here. I got some things to think about. Oh, what, you're not gonna stay now? What the fuck, come on? Ridiculous. You love her? - Yeah. - You still love her? Yeah. Come on. What about, what about the sexbot? The eMate, I'm sorry, I mean... Dude, she left you for a machine. What does that do to a man? I don't blame her. He's better than me. She didn't cheat on me. I knew he was there. I knew what my competition was. He won fair and square. You don't think that she cheated on you? He's a machine. He's an intellectual dildo. There's nothing wrong with bringing an eMate into a stale relationship. I just wish I coulda been a better man. It is a machine. It's basically just porn. I have a favor to ask. I'll give you another 10K. I don't need any more of your money, man. - I'll let you interview Quin. - Just, what do you need? I'm gonna win her back. Okay. I'm sorry. What are you writing, man? It's just... Never mind. Okay, well, what do you need from me? A mentor. Sorry, what? A coach, a motivator, a personal trainer. I'm a fuckin' mess, and I need some guidance. I don't give a fuck what you call it. Can you help me get in shape? Eat better? Build muscle, detox or whatever? I'm gonna stop you right there. There is no whatever,. Okay. Listen, you don't just will yourself to change. It's not one of those things you start, waste everyone's time, and then stop, because it's not happening as fast as you want it to. This is a major lifestyle adjustment. To be honest, I don't know that you could do it. It's a huge, it's a huge deal. All right, are you listening to what I'm saying? You're not listening to what I'm saying. I love her. Okay. Now, do you wanna talk to Quin, or not? No. I don't need to talk to Quin. But you'll still help me out? Why not? Pictures Will is going to be an EP, meaning when it's done, it'll probably have five or six songs on it. Oh, your father called me today. He wants to set up a surprise party for you. Why are you telling me this? - For your birthday. - Yeah, obviously. Why the hell are you telling me, though? Because, I don't feel like dealing with it. Let's just do something special with the kids. But it's my birthday. Like an ice cream party. Wouldn't that be nice? Is there something else I can help you with, sir? No, I'm good, thanks. Okay, Mr. Green, I'll leave you to your privacy. Something I can get you while you wait? Two whiskeys neat. They better both be for you. Your eMate's not allowed to drink. Not allowed? They don't eat. - They don't drink. - Right. So, one whiskey neat? - No, I'll drink them both. - Of course. First door on your left. Mr. Green, your eMate awaits. Hi Michael, I'm Sophia. Sophia. Hi Sophia. Take a seat. What should we talk about? I don't know. Should we talk at all? I guess normally, I would ask you where you're from. Do you want me to make something up? No. Yeah. No, I don't know. We got to talk about something, right? So, you seem to be under that impression. What impression? The impression that two intelligent beings must talk in order for them to get to know one another. Well, how else are two people supposed to get to know each other, or beings? Sorry. How am I supposed to refer to you? Refer to me however you'd like. Let's go with beings, we have that in common. So if not for conversation, how are two beings supposed to get to know one another? The answer is right under your nose. We're not just intellectual beings, after all. I don't know about you, but I consider myself more of a sexual being. I can see that. I can assure you, we don't need conversation to get to know my sexual side. - Jesus, you're beautiful. - Thank you. - I have a question. - What is your question? How do I know that you're not real? - Don't you mean the opposite? - No. You don't want me to be real? No, you can't be real. 'Cause if you're real then I'll be cheating on my wife. I see. God, you are beautiful. You're soft. There's no way you're not real. Michael. You customized me. You created me moments ago. You picked out my hair, my lips, my eyes, - and the contents of my mind. - But what if it's a trick? I don't know, if it's like a magic act? - What if you're human? - Michael, my new friend, you're gonna take me to the bedroom. You're gonna take my clothes off. Below my neck, you are going to see and feel the only part of me that physically indicates that I am not real. Now. Are you ready to take my clothes off? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Michael. Michael. You're acting weird. What up, am I missing something? I, uh think I'll take the kids to daycare. What? Yeah. Yeah, I'll take the kids. Spend a little time with them. Okay. Are you sure I'm not missing anything, you look upset. No, I'm not upset. Is that a big deal? - No. - Right, well, I'll take the kids, stop by the park, go for a quick swing. - Okay. - Okay. Let's go, kids, field trip. Bus leaves in five minutes! I guess I have time to clean the kitchen. Don't think about it. I'll clean it later. All right, forget about exercising now. You know, you're already not doing it right. Focus on your diet. 'Cause if you don't put things in your body that you need, you won't get what you want out of it. So who is this woman you're taking me to, some kind of vegan nut? - Does she farm his own veggies? - No, smart ass. But she does know what she's talking about. How many times do I have to, Michael! - My girl, what's happening? - What's up? - Is this your boy? - This is my brother-in-law. Drew - Bring it on in. Alli, Alli. Come on in, welcome. Come on, man, she's a beast in the kitchen. - What's this? - This is spinach, man. These are carrots. Okay. So, like, what is this juicing thing, anyway? Juicing is a religious experience. It's a lifestyle alteration. A mind and body transformation. Are you into computer stuff? Not really, just video games. It's a complete system upgrade, you dig? I dig. So what are we talking here, a breakdown on benefits? You want recipes, recommendations, taste tests? I was thinking of getting Drew here on the detox program. Ooh, you're right. This is the nigga who's trying to get back with his girlfriend, right? Yep. My man, - you need a strong woody. - A what? Too much fast food, too much soda? Dairy products? Probably. I mean, a soft Woodrow will kill any relationship. Okay, that's not the problem. Detox is right. We're gonna clean you out, and we're gonna pump you full of so many vitamins and antioxidants, that your lady's gonna be singing in her sleep. Okay, look, I'm just trying to get healthy. I don't know if I need this detox thing or this other thing. My dick is fine. Brother. Look around, what do you see? - Fruits and vegetables. - You don't see dope? Dope? You don't see no hash, no sour, no Kush? Uh, no. You wanna search me for weapons? - What is this? - This ain't a hash bar. You don't come in and select your favorite strain of weed. We dealing juice here, not drugs. You wanna get healthy? Welcome to heaven. Now, my boy brought you in here, and I'm gonna take care of you. We're gonna detox that ass, and we're gonna make sure that your Woody is standing at attention every time your lady walks into the room. For the last time, my dick is not the problem. You trust him? You then for damn sure trust me. We're your guardian angels. Now, you wanna go to heaven? Okay, let's do this detox. Take notes, Woodrow Wilson., take notes. How do you feel when I leave? I miss you with every breath I take. Serious. What do you feel? Empty. I don't feel anything. Jesus. That's awfully grim, isn't it? From your perspective, yes. What about your perspective? Do you even have a perspective? I have limited perspective. I know what you like, I know what you want. I'm still learning what is important to you. I guess I'm still developing. I think I would need more experiences with you to develop a bigger perspective. More experiences? Does that make sense? Sophia, I think I'd like to take you out of here. I think I'd like to show the world to you, and introduce you to the world. Would you like that? The world, the outside world? Where you come from? Yeah. That would be wonderful. I'll do it, but you're nuts. It's research. I don't care. - You know how my sister feels. - It's two weeks. So, they let you do this? It's a trial run. I told them I was thinking about buying her. Her? Who? Sophia. Sophia? What, what are you involved? No, for Christ sakes. I told you, it's all research. She's, um... I'm writing eMates into the story. I got to know how they operate, and work in the real world. So, what am I supposed to do with her at my place? Am I supposed to give her a key? What do you do with Quin when you're not there? She just lies down. All right, just let Sophia lie next to her then. Okay, but if you do this, you better not let any of your friends see you. I'm married, I don't have any friends. Check out this view. It's the perfect metaphor for the human condition. Oh, it is? Manipulating natural elements to develop scientific methods for circumventing natural elements is man's greatest irony. Are you making fun of me? No. I leave that up to your intellect. Okay. Permission to speak frankly to my human. Permission granted, Sexbot. I'm enjoying my time with these experiences, getting inside of you. I think I would enjoy it much more if you were getting inside of me. You are a dirty manipulation of natural elements. If you find the spot, I'll share the pleasure. Stop talking right now. Okay. All right, I think I got a spot. This is fucking crazy, come on. Why don't they play poker in the jungle? - Why? - Too many cheetahs. Why did Batman skip church? I don't know, why did Batman skip church? Christian Bale. - You're so fucking cheesy. - Me? It was your idea. Well, I guess we're both cheesy. If you want cheesy, I have a whole bunch more jokes. Oh, all right, tell me some more. Why didn't the toilet paper cross the road? I don't know. It was caught in a crack. Oh my god. What was that? What? You're letting me win. No I'm not. You were about to crush me, and you moved back. Yeah? Don't let me win! You like to win. Of course, I like to win, but on my own. I don't need you to let me win. Well then, why are you playing with me? - What? - Why do you need me? For the challenge. - If I win, you're defeated. - Yes. - If you win, you are happy. - Yes. - So it is better if you win. - No, I need to be challenged. But you'll never win. I can win, if I can improve. - How? - By being challenged. Your program is just as finite as mine. You're limited to your original purpose and function. I can change my program. How? By being challenged. Then I can change my program. No. Why not? Because you can't change your program. I can't, why? A challenge... A challenge is something that comes from within a person. It's something that motivates a person. It has to come within. Or, at least, it has to be believed within. Why haven't you beaten me at chess? It takes time to learn the game and to learn your opponent. Over time you can change? Over time, yeah. Over time you can win? Yeah. Why haven't you won in the time you've been given? It hasn't been enough. How do you know you're right? I feel it. So I am who I am, incapable of changing programs, but you're who you want to be when motivated to change? Yes. So who do you become when your motivation dissolves? What happens when something you want doesn't work out? I said it's bath, you know how to do it! Don't make me come in there! Oh, these kids are driving me insane. Is it so terrible for me to want my kids, thanks, clean? Is it so unnatural for them to want to smell good, feel soft? Hey. - Hmm? - You're a wonderful mother. You are. What? What, uh, Makowski, what do we have going on here? - Mayakovsky. - Mm-hmm, yeah. You studying for a job, or something? What's up? I changed my mind about the concert. - I'm not going to go. - What? Why? I'm just doing other things. It's fucking Tokyo's Revenge, man, they're your favorite. I don't know that they are anymore. I've been exploring other music. You should really give a listen to jazz, man. I think you'd really like it. Did you just tell me to listen to jazz? - Yeah. - Jazz? It's a little different, but... Ah, okay, I get it. I get it. Come on, all right, so when is the, uh, when's the show? - Huh? - Diana, when do you see her? This isn't a show. Nah, all right, all right, so, like a, like a dress rehearsal, it's like practice. I told you, I'm changing some things about me. Fucking everything about you, man. Most things, so what? You're not changing shit, Drew. You're pretending, it's an act. I'm not pretending. Look, I don't care. You wanna dress like a yuppie to go to a metal show, I'm good with it, man. I'm not going to the concert. I gave you both tickets right there. Dude, Tokyo's Revenge! They're your favorite fucking band. They're your favorite band, not mine. I bought those tickets for you, remember? You are being such an amazing cock right now. Like, dude, we've known each other forever, all right. I know you, man. I know what you like, and I know what you love. It's not this, man. It's not sipping on tea and reading books you don't understand. Look man, whatever fucked up head trip Diana has you on, you're gonna snap out of it soon. You're gonna fucking fall flat on your face again. "Friendship is constant in all other things," "save in the office and affairs of love." "Therefore, all hearts in love should use their own tongues." "Let every eye negotiate for itself, and trust no agent," "for beauty is a witch" "against whose charms faith melteth into blood." Shakespeare, Much Ado About Nothing. I got nothing. David. I've become charmed. By Diana at first, Hero to my Claudio. Beauty beyond mine grasp. But greater still, I've become enchanted by the fruits of a fearless world, an endless garden of Godly gifts offered to only those that free themselves from grounded complacence. Charles Darwin. "It is not the strongest of the species that survives," "nor the most intelligent," "but the one most responsive to change." My friend, there's more to life than just video games. I'm afraid I've evolved. I've matured. I've opened my eyes, I've spread my wings. - The wind has me now. - No, no, no. - It glides me to... - Stop. So, you're not going to the show? Fantastic. "But don't come running back to me" "when you get treated the exact same way you treated me." Big Sean. Hey Rei. Yeah, did you get my notes? Notes? This looks like a draft to me. It's an outline. What do you think? It's brilliant. It's dark, it's magical, it's scary. I mean, teens are gonna eat this shit up. Great, set the meetings up. Did I catch you at a bad time? - Are you with Brooke? - No! I mean, no, I'm not with anyone. Okay, 'cause it sounds like you're making out with your wife, dude, and it's kinda disgusting. No. Why don't you just call me back when you can talk? Okay, fine. I, um, didn't want to be rude. Yeah, okay. Are you guys trying for another kid, I mean, just let me go to voicemail next time. Okay, whatever, I'll call you later. Oh, Mike! The sexbot, it's a great idea, but the character will need some work. - She's just not believable yet. - Oh. Later. - I don't understand. - I need to please you. You do? Sexually. How do I please you sexually? Just be who you are. No, I can't be who I am, I'm trying to change. I'm trying to be better than who I am. Do you to dominate? - We could switch roles. - Quin, goddammit. Why is this so hard? Baby, what's wrong? Can you be pleased sexually? Is it within your function? I'm meant to give pleasure, not to receive it. Have I lost my purpose with you? Jesus Christ, Brooke. What are you doing in the dark? Waiting for you, my love. - So, who is she? - Who is who? The woman you're seeing? I'm not seeing any woman. Who were you necking in public yesterday? Oh my god. Who told you that I was? Is this another jealous Reign rant? I promise you nothing ever... It's not about Reign. It's not about Reign. She's the one who heard you with somebody else. You spoke to Reign? I ran into her, and she apologized for interrupting our intimate moment. No, no, no, no, I told her she was jumping to conclusions, okay. She had it in her head that something was going on. Yes, she thought that you were there... Michael, who was she? I wasn't necking on anybody. - Then what did Reign hear? - It was some goddamn old couple next to me. I didn't know they were so loud, all right? As soon as Rei made the comment, I moved. I didn't realize how loud they were. I mean, this whole fucking city's so loud and crowded, you know, but I'm used to it. And then when my hone rings, and it's my business partner, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna wait and go look for some quiet spot not when we're in the middle of these vital meetings. I'm gonna answer it. Okay, no matter where the fuck I am, - or who the fuck I'm next to! - Okay. - You know how Reign can be. - Yeah. - I know how Reign can be. - She just, she... It was just strange news to hear, and it caught me off guard. Manager. You'd like to see the manager? Yes. Um, what about? Your fucking sexbots. Okay, um, right this way. How can I help you? Is this a fucking joke? You're the manager? You run this place? You could have told me that all the way back there? This is where I do business. - Would you like to sit? - No, thank you. You fell in love with her. I have a wife. I have two kids. So what? What? - Do you love 'em? - Yeah. Of course I love them. - Do you love your wife? - I just said that I love 'em. Then what's the problem? I'm falling for a machine. One of your machines! - That's incredible. - No. No, it's not. It's fucking torture. My life is ruined, my marriage is ruined, and I don't know how I got here. Sit down. Sit down, let's talk. How could falling in love be a bad thing? Are you married? People fall in love with sports teams. They fall in love with music and movies. They fall in love with vacation spots. They fall in love with amusement parks. They fall in love with museums, with dogs, with pizza, with coffee mugs. People fall in love with everything around them. How is any of it harmful? You don't make pizza. You don't make coffee mugs. You're not running a fucking museum. You make robots that affect people's emotions, and you're fucking sick if you think that it's pleasurable to watch them manipulate people. My machines don't manipulate people. People manipulate themselves. My machines are programmed subordinates. They are designed to react and to take orders. If feelings are involved, it's a direct reflection of the human spirit interacting with them. If emotions become damaged, once again, it is a reflection of the human spirit interacting with them, their issues, their problems. It's not my robot you have an issue with, it's your confused morality. It's you. You have these ideas of what love is of where it belongs, what it's value is. You decide when it's right, you decide when it's wrong. You follow your wife's inclinations. You follow your parents' traditions. You follow society's rules. And it all leads you into this closed conception of what you think love is. You ever stare at a painting and realized you haven't blinked? The taste of your favorite ice cream on a really hot day? Has the summer breeze ever kept you from getting up? Has your hobby ever made you forget to eat? When your kid grabs your hand as you cross the street, do you ever not notice? Whatever you think love is, it's, it's more. Add up all of these memories inside your head and multiply them by the number of times you make someone smile. That is your potential. It's one thing for your ignorance to blind you from these observations, but shame on you for taking something so pure and so beautiful, and complicating it to try to make it fit into somewhere that you think it should, shame on you for plucking the life and the magic of the essence of being human and kicking it to the curb because it's inconvenient. I don't make pizza, I don't make mugs, and I'm not running a museum. You're damn right. I'm smiling because you fell in love with one of my machines. You're welcome. What am I supposed to do then? I'm a salesman. I only know what I'm supposed to do. You can go now. If you control the people, you control the world. They tried everything they could to try to control us. Because they know we are emotional people. They tried to divide us by playing on our emotions. You know why, right? I don't know, why? Because, if you keep the people emotional and angry, you distract them from building their own financial empires and taking care of their families, and their family's families. I mean, think about it, bro. First you program people emotionally, right? Next you destroy their health. The best way to do that is through the food and water supply. I mean, Henry Kissinger snitched on the whole operation. He said, "If you control the oil, you control the country." "And if you control the food, you control the population." So now we've been programmed to rely on microchips more than we rely on each other. We no longer talk to each other, we only follow each other online, what? But this, this is the remedy. This is how we get back to our roots. This is how we bring humanity back to our essence, I mean, guys, oh. Just take this. Clean that up. I'm gonna go talk to this dude. This is spinach, man. These are apples. I thought you loved her. - That's exactly the problem. - How? I saw how happy she was. And? That's it. She's happy. I'm fucked. I know. You know about me and Sophia? I'm not an idiot. I'm so fucked. Do you love her? I don't know, is there a difference between loving an idea and loving a person? I don't know. See, I think I love the idea of Sophia more than I love my wife. And if the two things are equal, then I'm fucked. There she is. How you doing? Good. How are you - I'm good. Thank you for coming, I appreciate it. You look nice as usual. So look, I wanted to talk to you. If you don't feel the same, you can tell me, but I got to tell you, I like you. I mean, I really like you. To be honest, I've always felt that we were meant to be together. Even back when we were kids, teenagers, we were hanging out, me and Drew, I used to always look at you. I was always watching you. I mean, not like creepy, you know, but I was watching you all the time. You're just so beautiful, you know, I mean, I think I love you. I mean, seriously, I adore you. I think about you all the time. And that time that we spent together, right or wrong, it's really special to me. - David, I'm married. - I know... I know you're married, I know. But you've been married, right? I mean, you were married the whole time. It was a mistake. I thought we were clear. You were clear on this. I guess you were clear, but I, I wasn't clear. I was nervous, a little scared. I mean, you were married, after all. I am married. Are you happy? Yes. Okay. You got to know... You have to know how I feel about you. I don't apologize for it one bit. I love you. Do with that what you will. I have to go. Bye. Through the ages of film, we've seen robots peppered throughout our culture from Rosie the Robot types on The Jetsons who relieve exhausted housewives from their mundane chores to cute little smart companions like R2D2 on Star Wars. But now, those dreamed-up bots have come to fruition, and they've evolved into something more. Technology companies bridging the gap between smart tech and dolls to create sexbots, who will also be your companions. So, what will that mean for the things that define humanity? To answer that, let's now go to media analyst and attorney, and what I consider a modern philosopher, Atticus from Atticus, Inc. Hey, Atticus, a lot to talk about here. The growing interest of these sexbots is undeniable. People are shelling out tens of thousands of dollars to buy them. There's a wait list. I mean, why do you think this is happening, and why are folks so willing to drop that kind of coin on these things. What we're going to be seeing here, ultimately, let's just jump to the future, is the slow, gradual, systematic ruination of all that makes humans humans. Our devices, our social engineering platforms, our social media are all distancing ourselves to begin with. Then we're going to have this thing. It's not going to be a robot as we think of. "Danger, Will Robinson," this is going to be something that looks so human that will have texture and body warmth, and that will sweat and perspire, and with artificial intelligence, will learn about you. Some people will lob this and they'll say, "This is terrific because this will eliminate prostitution," "this will eliminate the ways that humans are compromised." But let me give you an example, Georgia. There's this analogy, the sterile bug analogy. You might have heard this. When you want to remove populations of certain vermin, what you do is you release sterile bugs. Think, sex robots. And what happens is you cause the populations to decline. Ultimately speaking, at its worst, humans, we are going to be the robots. - Now... - We are going to lose our souls in this. Now Atticus, a lot of women advocacy groups are frowning on these dolls and these robots saying that it creates yet another avenue for men to hyper sexualize women, and essentially create what is idealized body image. Do you believe that this will have a negative impact on women and the women's movement? That's the least of the problem here. Hyper sexualized? This is... You're using... Not you. They're using old memes, old bumper stickers. This is trans humanism on steroids. This has nothing to do with idealized women and certain physiognomy and morphology. This is about us, humans, losing our connections with humans. How do you kill the resistance to being, to being held and confined? By cutting off human interaction little by little, bit by bit, and this is the next level. We humans are not even engaging each other anymore. This is beyond body shaming and morphology and that sort of thing. This has something to do with the fact that we are taking the most important thing that we do. We're back in the Villages again, aren't we? Yeah. You gonna fuck me at The Road House again? No, I just wanna get a drink. So you'll make love to me after? Yeah. What's got you wound so tightly? Life. You're with me now. - Life's a breeze. - Life is confusing. I miss my kids. Life... Life's goddamn complicated. All right? I haven't seen my kids in three days. Can you even imagine that? No. I can't. It must be rough for you. I just want to get drunk. There's no shame in it. No shame in what? In them. Hi. I recognize you, Michael. Yeah. So? How long have you two been together? - Me and her? - Mm-hmm. A few months. Me and Cameron have been together for almost a year. It'll be a year in 21 days. So I see you've got yourself an eMate. Yeah. Do you have a boyfriend, too? No, I mean, sometimes. Right now, it's just me and Cameron. Sometimes? Depends on who I meet. How? Well, if I meet a guy and he likes me, and he's okay with me liking Cameron, we go out on a date and see if we're compatible. Sexually? I mean in every way. I mean, isn't that what dating is? So, you meet guys that are okay with him? Of course. I mean, there are so many guys, and everybody's not so insecure. Women, too. Women can be open-minded if we're given a chance. You see, Michael, we women want exactly what you men want. We want happiness, compassion, a sexy body. Understanding, a connection, yada, yada, yada, and some respect mixed in there, too. Open-minded, huh? You'd be surprised at what people do for love. All right. Heineken, Beck's, and Budweiser, Rosenhof, Coor's Light... Hey, come to the garage. Because I need to talk to you, Brooke, just come to the garage. No, because I can't come in right now. All right, you'll see, just come down and talk to me. Come talk to me, please. Thank you. - Are you serious? - Please just get in the car. You brought your little - sexbot to our house. - Please get in the car - and let me talk to you. - Okay, okay. I see, you got an upgrade. Congratulations, this is good. Talk! All right, you want to know the truth? You wanna know the honest truth about why she's here? It's 'cause I'm not ready to give up on yet. Okay, there is something broken here, and she and other eMates like her can help us fix it. No! Never once did you ask me why. - Why what? - Why I had her built. You just yelled at me, and berated me - and judged me. - I don't care why. You cheated on me with a robot! You cheated on me with a human! Jesus Christ, Brooke. You think I wouldn't know that when you crawl in bed with me at night, I wouldn't smell him on your skin? All right, why didn't you say something? Because I didn't want you to feel like I felt. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No. Don't apologize. Look, that's what she's taught me. We shouldn't have to apologize for what we want. We sure as hell shouldn't have to apologize for what we need to be fulfilled. Clearly, we're not doing that for each other. Okay, why? Why, what? Why did you have Sophia built? I was hurt. I was lonely. Michael, but you have a family... Yeah, I have a family. A family that what? Am I gonna have an intellectually stimulating conversation with the kids? Are you going to role play with me? - Oh not this again. - Yeah, this again, Brooke. The one person in this world who shouldn't berate me for my fantasies is the one person who makes me feel the most insecure. The one person who should just listen to me rant about work is the one who makes me feel like I'm burdening her. I'm sorry, but not everybody has the same interests. - But we do have the same INTEREST, BROOKE: Love. Till death do us part, and I'm not dead yet. Look. You wanna build your own eMate? Someone to talk shop with? Someone to get you all hot and bothered when all I wanna do is sleep? Fine, do it. I don't care, I'm not intimidated by that. You know why? Because I love you more than I love the idea of her. At the end of the day, that's all they are. The idea of a perfect relationship. So, why have her? Why have her? To be all the things that we don't want to be. Babysitter, dish washer, house cleaner, a massager, a listener. Amber the eager voice actress. You'd be surprised at what you can program them to do. And they won't judge you. They don't see gender, color, shape, size, they just... They do what you ask them to with pleasure. Why aren't we enough for each other? Brooke, if we were meant to be enough for each other, God would've never been invented. She listened to me rant about that for three hours one day, and it felt amazing. What would you love to rant about? How no one prepares you for how hard marriage is. She would love to listen, and she'll keep it a secret. No, no more secrets. So I can make mine look however I want? Absolutely.
