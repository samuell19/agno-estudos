Stopped functioning because of the sanctions It depends on the power of the ministry letter they receive If it doesn't work out I have to send these workers away -It's become a nightmare I swear -Bahram I think production is over I think you'd rather go into import dealing and stuff If you know someone in customs -You'll make a fortune -Being a dealer! Buy cheap, sell for more The fate of a production manager like me is nothing but bankruptcy -I'm afraid of having a stroke -Forget it Relax a little Go on a trip Trip?

Good thing I didn't, it'd be too small Did he send you photos? He didn't tell me No I saw it on Instagram, the ones he'd taken at the gym Do you take your pills Shirin? The antidepressants, make me drowsy the diet pills are energetic. I'm going crazy Forget that -A few days ago was Mahshid's daughter's wedding -Aunt Rana has lost so much weight with the pills Are you even taking the pills? How come you've not lost any weight? Aren't you taking them? Shima don't you ever go to sleep? It's not good for your skin. Let me live my life - We'll talk later, okay? - Everytime How are you tiger? Have some celery juice I'm here to see you... To pay a visit Thanks You left without a word the other night now you're upset too? - Was it so important if I had stayed? - It'd be someone else instead When one person gets freaked out sending negative vibes, it ruins the night Why did you bring the girl there if she didn't want to be there? Look Amir, watch it She's not just some girl We're engaged, kind of 'Kind of' Good one The whole package - What can I say? - Does it concern you? It's not any of my business. There's no photo of you both on your Instagram -Then you're engaged -Yes, because she doesn't want to Her parents have allowed us to stay in a certain phase So your father-in-law tells you what phase to be in I had to choose between selling the land and taking Kiana back When you were out of your mind and chose the second one If I were to go back, I'd still make the same decision -My life is miserable because of that night -It was your fault You left when Sepehr got there I'd have made the deal if you'd stayed longer You'd have sold the storage by now I'd have sold it See? Friendships are between men only That's enough, our pizza is ready - Should I go wash my hands? - Yes How's your headache? Thank you! Your hands work magic I forgot I had a headache It's a new kind of massage, I learned it from the Thai lady It's great for muscles spasms in the neck Introduce me to her, to see if she's having fun here Great!

Yeah I've only just got it -Right our pizzas will be ready in 20 minutes -Great - Did you see my last post on Instagram? - That was you? -I didn't recognise you -Seriously? Did I look that bad? I was wearing the sunglasses you got me in Paris - How did you not recognise me? - I was joking -How could I not? That trip was great -Yeah I wish we could go again. I need a trip Sure we'll go sometime Who was the kid next to you? -Are you jealous? I wish I could have our photo on Instagram -Don't! You can't do -I know Shame I can't That's Ms Fattahi's kid Our accountant, Bahram you've no idea how sweet she is She sticks to me and asks when I'll take her home Enough, here -I'll show you -You will? -Sure, we'll see -I've written two books on backgammon I know which you gifted to your teacher We'll see Go on -One, throw -You held it No, throw again, you held it, impossible Give it to me, you're making excuses from the start - How did you find out?- I saw it on his Instagram Shirin he posted something full of sad things -I think they've broken up again Shirin -I'll call you back Shima -Hi -Hi Good day I saw you throw it inside Keep ordering pills from the TV Weren't you supposed to stop talking those pills? Are they going to help you lose weight? If it wasn't for those pills... Do you want food? I don't want dinner -It's a surprise -I heard your voice message Why are you so mad? Is there something wrong? - Can I help you? - You want to go inside the microwave? - You're mocking me? - No - Can you do anything other than cooking? - I'm worried about you About what? Yours son goes to sleep hungry? No actually For my son to not talk to me about his problems Your aunt said you'd posted something. She was worried -She asked if you have a problem -It's a miracle My aunt in America knows what my problem is But my mother next in the next room doesn't What difference does it make? I'm worried about you What should I do for you to stop worrying? I'm human too -I have the right to be worried -No you don't I'd been worried about your fights with dad since childhood To take your messages back and forth did you see the worry in my eyes? Did you listen to me for me to do the same? Weren't you supposed to stop the pills? To lose weight? To get a makeover? Now don't play the role of a kind mother Watch it What's the nonsense? I'm worried about you but I don't offend you You want me to call you dumb like your dad for studying a degree for six years? You mock my weight now? I will for you to come to your senses To realise what's happening to you I'm the most hated in this house More like a mental house and someone to cook I'll toss them in the bin -Hi -Hi - What's happened now? - Nothing Nothing, thank God! -Alright for you -What should I do? Should I throw him out of the house? -No! Don't -See? When he was a kid you tried to protect him from everything and everyone I said nothing, then I tried to be friends with him when he was ten. You didn't let me "He has to sleep, he has homework, he's got to go to sleep" Where are you taking him? I still didn't complain He got into university, I said "let me take him to work to become independent" You stopped me. "Where are you taking him?" "It's a long way, he'll get tired, he can't study" Here, I couldn't have a word with this kid... Without you complaining You want food? I can warm it up It's chicken tahchin and cherries It's 1 a.m. in the morning Who'd have rice at this age? Dinner is a small meal at 8 p.m. -You're not home then -You suggest I leave work... To come home to you Who goes home at 8? Home Yes -Come here a second -Yes Here, your ID Take whatever else you need from the document wallet Don't wake me up For you with love - What's this? - It's a small gift, guess what it is - Did I ask you for a perfume? - It's not a perfume It's a simple gold ring Thought you might like it Suppose a diamond, did I ask for this? Did I ask for gold? I want an apology that's all You were upset with me and I tried to make it up to you Was I wrong? I'll forgive you when it's not about the gift Say I did something wrong and I apologise And I'll respectfully agree to forgive you Because then I'll know you're sorry and you won't do it again I got angry the other night and did something wrong Some guy who was high said some nonsense -Forget it -Some guy who's high Why should he say I've heard you're working on a paper -With his filthy work -I told him you're working on a paper Stupid idiot He didn't get paper means dissertation He thinks paper is a drug Which means flying More like crashing I'm saying from his perspective no need to pick on me Look Arman If you decide to meet come here Where did you leave the dye? Why don't you toss these out? They're all expired I'm so busy today Tomorrow Ms Ghassemi has a gathering. I want to dye my hair I can't reach the back come do it for me -Okay, mum -Thanks I'll mix your dye I need to get back home later What's the rush? We'll have lunch then you can go Shirin, I need a word -Yes dad -Today is women's day The TV said this morning I want you to buy your mum a very good gift Sure Mum? Do I come in? - Why did you cut your hair? - I trimmed it a little - Is it the volleyball game? - Yes love Iran and Brazil I wish we had some time to talk Talk and see what's new I would love to dad, but...

As if I'm an ATM He's young. Wouldn't it be better if you'd waited on the back street? I'm wearing heels, I got tired I thought you'd say they'll report you or whatever -That was before, they're okay now -I could've waited outside the bank then I did say they're okay but not like that They're sensitive about single ladies -The focus on them -It's your fault, wear the ring. So I can pick you up They know I'm single It's not fixed with a ring just marriage Bahram a marriage certificate will shut them up Our relationship is legal I talked to you about this on the first day I can't you know Look, I got my results. I can get pregnant -My baby will be fine -You're starting again Who said you couldn't? -Why do you get upset -Suppose you love someone for themselves Then you find out, he only wanted a kid - How would you feel then? - Looks like there's been a misunderstanding I give you the right If I thought the man of my life wants me just for a baby, I'd feel bad too But our case is different I love you for you I love you Bahram Do you love me? -Yes -Let's get going then No way I'll fix it for you Don't pay attention to it -But the eyebrow shape I did for you -Dark at the top, blonde near the ends Don't get extensions, your hair will become weak I want it to be different Yeah come here for your party on Thursday I'll dye your hair ombre Make it thinner if you can -Hi -Hi -I had an appointment to dye my hair -Yes -Bahar she's here for he hair -Wait there, I'll be with you I'll call you, bye for now -Thanks -These are our colours - I pick from here? - Yes I've never been to a salon or dyed my hair since my wedding I got some highlights close to my wedding Look this blue one and the coffee coloured one are the best I got highlights close to my wedding Then my husband said either your natural colour or black So I never went for it Now I have too many white hairs I used to cut the before but now I can't be bothered Which one have you chosen? I don't know. What colour is in fashion right now? -People mostly have light colours -It should suit you obviously Can we go for a colour that makes me seem younger? - You're young! - I have a 24 year-old son Well then you got married young Yes I was 20 when I had him Women your age are either single or have 20 year-old boyfriends Then you think you're too old? There's also this... I think according to your skin colour This colour is really good - What's new? What happened? - Nothing -He wouldn't let go -What about your car? It's just the bumper. Thanks for sending the money or I'd still be there No problem, what decision did you make? What do you want to do? Can you buy some time for me? Or a little discount, on the bond at least This place is great, I don't want us to lose it I have to go otherwise I'd never let anyone else have it I have one way... To find a good customer for the storage place to sell it My dad said if I do, I can have half the share I've collected all the cups I've brought these out instead We've stored everything away for no reason Good idea I remember you used to like these thin ones - Was that sarcasm? - Sarcasm? Why sarcasm? I meant the cups I got it - What is it? - I want to leave you - Congrats! - I'm joking Look Bahram the stone has fallen off I thought you give it to Mr Shaabani to fix Okay Hot tea Dad used to say better than hot is when it's perfect. No one can complain - Are you okay? - Why do you ask? Shut up, why are you being sarcastic? - Why do you say that? - "You like them thin" "Perfect so you don't complain". You think I don't get it? - Are you in doubt of yourself? - No I'm not I doubt your words. You always mean something else Suppose it does, why do you take it personal -You're probably thinking of the wrong thing -Fine, you're the perfect woman I'm a mobile ATM I asked for a place to sleep a towel and a toothbrush If you think it's too much I can always move out What are you saying Bahram? If you don't want to come home at all then don't. Why look for excuses? Great! - Are you leaving or coming back? - Leaving You're an early bird. Why do you look like that? - Why are you a mess? - I didn't sleep well I should tend the factory, insurance company and so many other things - What about you? - I had something important to do And what would that be? See? You're telling me What happened to your degree? Or your military service? Could you once, for once... - Ask me how I am, after saying hi? - You seem fine, thank god Otherwise you'd be on the hospital bed Don't think just because you run away I don't know what you're doing You chase up that degree this is the last time I'm telling you I don't want to work in that factory even if I get my degree No one's waiting for you there Sell the storage, take half the share. Let's see what you can do What's happened to the car? -It doesn't matter -What's that mean? Listen to your voicemail whenever you get the time to. I had an accident that's what the money was for. You were busy as always Cheeky Get up, what's this? I got your some celery smoothie -Get up -That was my phone you trampled on Now you ask what it was? - Am I guilty again? - Am I? For your husband who hates coming home? What's my fault? So you've let him go to be on my case Fine I won't "be on your case" How come when I cook, do the laundry or tidy up your room it's my responsibility Bringing you up is my responsibility When I call, you're the poor guy I'm the bully? I'm not a kid, I'm an adult Here, see. You called eight times Not once, that's what I mean When you should spend time with your husband, you call me Watch your language! If you turn 100 Arman, if you have ten children of your own You're the kid and I'm your mother What are you saying? What husband? Your dad doesn't even see me I dyed my hair after 20 years He didn't notice. I wish he'd told me I looked ugly Not so indifferent Look at me You didn't notice me like your dad Hi, how are you? Yes I'll set off now What's the problem? When she showed me a picture of you... Said "mum you know there's never been a man in my life" This one is because he means well and wants to become serious You trust me and don't ask questions I never did to be honest and trusted her Yes I understand Would it be possible for you to introduce me to her father? So I can explain my situation So we can be engaged at least Her father won't accept, I know him -He only sees marriage as being official -So many of mine and Kiana's friends Are living together without being married Everyone would love to live without rules -But that's not possible -Yes, you're right But I'm not in the position I need more time... To sell the damn place and get some money Please Look I'm doing it there's no way back Take a look at these you might decide to get one Your first decision is always the best. Life means excitement The more you think, the more miserable you are Life is excitement Right bro? -Definitely -Don't move -Don't move -Seen you posted for free drugs - You give out free drugs? - No Some want drugs, want drugs to feel better and sell drugs I'm at everyone's service, first one is paid the other one free When should we get together Sepehr? -Do it with others -I mean the land The owner is here, Arman I wish I could look at the paperwork It's not on me To be honest no one carries it around He's a good landlord he knows the papers should stay in the safe Once we agree on the price, I'll bring the paperwork -Calm down -Don't move Cut all of it so I don't have to cut it ever again Don't get cheeky. I can't do that you need to go to the barber's Don't move -Raana -Yes love You've not forgotten about the loan letters? Yes, today we were after the files They said they'd help if they can It's probably done, don't worry -Bahram -Yes love You'll stay tonight, right? No, I can't. But I'll leave late. Is that good? I wanted to say I was angry the other day -I'm sorry -Leave me alone Go away I'm not well Arman I said I wasn't okay Arman why can't we talk? You're upset about something right now It's got nothing to do with me tell me what it is I'm your mother Arman, who else would you talk about it? Don't break your mother's heart Arman I'll be waiting to hear about it What's this girl's story? She has a suitor Every girl has suitors Her parents can't wait for me to finish my degree or military service Right, that's normal too. What else? They might say "yes" to him Right I don't want to lose her mum What does she think? Does she love you too? Yes mum she does, I love her too That's it, you don't know us women We're willing to wait forever for the one we love You want me to talk to her? They have a condition Then I'll make some tea and for you to tell me about it Get up The first few months weren't too serious for me I had a good feeling of having a friend I didn't think of how long we'd be together... Or if it'll become serious Then it wasn't too serious to begin with -Then it became serious -Not as serious as you'd think -Yes, you haven't introduced Kiana to the family -I don't mean that I mean our relationship has some limitations That's more like a joke for couple in the 21st century The only serious thing is how we feeling about one another -It can be a positive point -Yes But the limitations are annoying When did this aggression and anger management issue start? -It's always been like that, now a little more -It's always been like that My problem isn't him shouting right now It's the apology I told you about last session -Arman doesn't know what apology means -What is it? Does it have a strange meaning? It means saying sorry I bought you a present with little money, I had to say sorry - Is that bad? - Apology has a principle People kill, they pay blood money and it's sorted -I have to say sorry somehow -It's in your words In your looks, in your heart Not buying expensive gifts with your dad's money I was wrong I was wrong to have gotten you a gift That's what I meant Looks like I owe you something too now Kiana wait outside, I'll call you if necessary Have a glass of water What other factors do you think there are? Other than the things you already said - What else makes you so angry? - I don't know I'm always like this Have your parents dealt with your anger issues? -We don't talk much -You don't talk to them much -No one does -Why not? We might get together once or twice a year, an eid Wedding or funeral in the family Hi mum, how are you? I'm fine, no Arman is inside I don't know as much as we need -It's an emotional breakup -It's become epidemic It's a good name, never heard of it before That's exactly what they're like Yes love - Do you know what I thinking of in the shower? - Of what?

Say it louder It's broken? Can it be... The fuse? Why should we shut down? Call Mr Amani to come Yes call him, I'll be there Why do you say you'll go? We're about to have dinner -One of our machines are broken, Chinese parts -I made food Okay but I got to go otherwise it'll be shut down Then I'll wait till you get back I won't eat We'll see how much it costs Great food It's so good Don't fall out with me, leave it in the fridge I'll come eat it You never said why you want the storage Grow beetroots I think you're better off growing cactus because of the water issue It's a type of flower -Great place -That's it Right, where do we start?

I could have but once Arman was born, I left university - Why? - I wanted to point to Rostam and Sohrab but we'll leave it till later Why did you leave uni when Sohrab I mean Arman was born? That's a long story I got pregnant on my last term Then when you become a mother you should forget your own preferences It all becomes the bringing up, cleaning cooking Then you become the expert in Qorma or Gheimeh Bademjan -My entire life became my son -And your son's father, of course When you become a mother, everything changes Especially the pregnancy I had... The scent of my husband's presence made me sick Everytime I saw him, I'd be sick After my delivery, my life was Arman Your Arman, got help before things got too serious Good to know the parent's cooperation during therapy is really important Mrs Samee You know Arman is living with a brother and sister Instead of his parents I'm talking about the affection in the relationship You think this lack of feelings is normal for your son? Doesn't your husband object? I thought he's a bit agitated at first He was angry -But he never said anything himself -What about you? You never talked about it? -No -Why not? I'm too embarrassed, we've been brought up like this That's not right, as you can see In our country couples accept all sorts of right for one another Other than the legal right to love Do you know the result of these excuses? In our country, most women experience early menopause at the age of 40 They're mostly depressed or feel old They experience pains and aches - You think it's their own fault? - They're not innocent What kind of a role model as a woman Who can't talk of the most important and feminine can she be? The first love of any boy's life is his mother It might have been in the past but not anymore When he was a kid he loved me a lot We were always together Sometimes his dad would be jealous, I'd sense it When I'd hug Arman If Bahram was close he'd react in a way that I'd know he's jealous Then as he got older... We become strangers as if... The older he'd get the more distance would come between us Up to when he did really become an adult It's been a few years he doesn't confine in me He lies, he hides things... Doctor... You won't believe Sometimes he stands in front of me 2 metres tall... Shouts... Offends me and patronises me He doesn't love me anymore -Here you go -Thanks Hi, sorry I'm late Is it done? The streets were jam-packed Thanks Congrats! Thank you - You liked the products? - It was great -They were all brands -Glad you liked them Thanks Ask your friends to come, the new products will arrive next week. I went to see the Doctor today. She was really good What are you trying to say? You suggest I take advice from a woman at this age? So she takes your side at the end? Bahram I say it for Arman -Help us end this situation -What situation? Look around you, people don't have food on their table. What are you saying? People are poor but they love each other at least I know you've stopped loving me, I know it Why am I here? For my son? A son who'll have his own life soon? What happens when he leaves? I'll become your maid? - Or I should wait to become a grandmother? - Have I not done enough for you? - Disrespected you? - You're not a woman It's disrespectful when a husband separates his room from his wife Well done! - What else has this lady taught you? - Bahram were you this disappointed in me? That I wouldn't know these things? I'm sorry If I leave it'll be bad for you Shirin I'm telling you Let's not forget uni now that we've opened this place -No but I had to have this place -Why? When I decide to get married soon... Her dad asks what I do I won't have to say I'm unemployed, might be doing a masters... Stand in front of him... Hold my head up, stand up straight Say didn't you realise from how good I smell? -I have a perfume shop -No way! Who's the lucky girl? I'll have to see who's feet will fit the shoe -Yes -Let's see whose head gets this one Stop don't move Mr Moradi Arrange the meeting with Mr Abtahi at 3 p.m. No I can't come now I'm busy The first reason for HIV is the dangerous physical relationships These are the stats the health service has published. They're on all websites. - You want me to carry on? - You've understood how urgent the situation is In the middle of all the miseries the society is dealing with How you mess with a married woman to argue with her husband Which will only lead to divorce Don't you think you're responsible for the tsunami of divorces? A tsunami comes from the moving plates underneath the sea I passed these lessons 20 years ago People like you put things in married women's heads like -How their family is taking away their rights -Mr Samee -You never let me finish -You let me talk I've put my business aside to come here for one thing I'm here to say leave me and my family alone, done Your son needs help He's my client And I asked for you to come in relation to him - Is my son ill? - He wasn't But if you don't help him now it'll become too late Have a seat for a minute please To talk - What's wrong with Arman? - It's nothing serious yet -I don't want to worry you -Well... Arman has no problem, I mean I'll sort it out. Whatever it is Mr Samee I feel like we need to be a a bit more frank -Sure go ahead -You have a relationship outside marriage And your son, your only child knows about it -So what? Everyone does -They do So many do, unfortunately Who are the victims of these parallel relationships? In most marriages, challenges arise after a while Only one side with good management is enough Talk about the problem But for some men this is an opportunity to escape - Am I right? - You've decided to defend my wife. There's no point Mr Samee, am I right? I don't know I know I'm not a puppet... For my wife to reject me one day and take me back a few years later, bye Mr Samee -Your phone -Thanks I think you better give this advice to newly weds It's too late for us Call Sepehr to see what happened to the contract and the documents -Good thing you reminded me -Yeah give him a call -Good work -Thanks Hi Vahid, how are you? What happened to the contract and documents? Why didn't you send it? How many times do you ask for the address? Okay will do, bye Have this with your tea It's good for you heart I don't want tea at this time. I'll have to go to the toilet a hundred times Will you let me watch the news? Yes Once you've watched, let me know what the Doctor said - Was she supposed to say anything? - Why did you go then? -I was going to talk -Right If you want to know what I said pay loads of money to see her and ask Stop being stubborn, let her help us end this bad situation -Trust her -This situation will end once everything ends Otherwise my life is fine What about my life? I think he's fine too But if you think you have a problem, file for a divorce and find someone better The same thing you've done without a divorce? Well done! Thanks for the honesty You know I can find someone better but don't tell me to my face Because I respect you, you're my son's mother You're the woman of this house, I've always slept in this house What's the point? Like you say, it's a hotel A towel, and toothbrush. Clothes and a bed that you can sleep comfortably in -Otherwise it's not called a home -Okay If you think I shouldn't come to whatever this is, fine I won't No I said let's turn it into a home How? With surgery? With therapy? -With whatever we tend -Like what? We've nothing in common to work on. I don't know Our son is what we have in common but we can't work on it The one person we have in common, I paid him so he'd piss off So we've nothing in common after 26 years of being married? -We do -That's great! What's good? Why do you answer so fast? Did you even get what I meant? I say we do have common things in this life But it's the fact that we're both unhappy We're forced to live under this roof Why forced? We can stop living together Fine, I'll leave this life. That way you'll lose out on less I'll take my rubbish from this house and go Thank God I don't have much anyway You've packed a long time Bahram But I didn't want to leave before this If it was 15 years ago, I'd ask you not to leave I'd beg you I'd fall at your feet, I'd make Arman an excuse But I've no energy A strong person should stop you from leaving and that's not me Because you never wanted me to be strong for a day like this What is it mum? Where did dad go? What was wrong with him? - Where are you going? - You could've asked him He never asks me where I go do I don't ask him either For this day. I did ask you so now I'm off to your nan's. Move over -Tell me -Move over -Mum tell me -Move Everything ended, this is something you got us into Don't worry you're exempt from military service -That's so unfair, let me take you at least -No need You scared me! Why like this? - What are you doing here? - Why should you be scared? We have keys, no one else is supposed to be here Of course only we have keys But I got scared You'd left late but you never came here this late You scared me You think I shouldn't have come? What time is this? - Why is your phone off? Who's this kid? - My phone died I promised Niknaz to take her to amusement park Mrs Fattahi's daughter You're jealous? Jealousy! As if What's wrong Bahram? You don't trust me? -You're controlling me -I'm not in the mood to argue -You want me to ask Mrs Fattahi to get her -No need What is it then Bahram? What brought you here at this time of the night? I ended it with Shirin What did you do? What are you saying? You finally got what you wanted -Dad mum left the house -I'll get some tea -No need, I'll go -Where to? - Where to Bahram? - I'm not well -I want to be alone -You're here to be with me after so long -Now you want to go -I did but now I want to leave, I'm not well Fine but come back quick, I'll be waiting to talk Mum don't you think I get worried when you just leave? I called several times but you didn't answer your phone Listen to this voice message at least and answer this Seems like a therapist can't help the two of you either I thought I could help you but it seems like I was wrong again I came home early to give you good news I wanted to know Mehri, if you're home for me to come see you No, it's my niece's birthday has something happened? -No -Really? -I wanted to come see you, some other time -Don't be shy -No thanks -Take care -Okay sorry, -Keep in touch Hello ma'am, is there something wrong? No, I'll be off Hi, sorry am I mistaken? Mrs Shirin Judi The energetic girl in the literature department? -I don't recognise you -You've every right But I always admired you I'm Mehrdad Fotouhi, your classmate Sorry I don't remember - You said Mr? - Fotouhi I work with flowers now, I'm always on trips I've an exhibition next week I'd be happy to see you Bye for now I gave you keys so you wouldn't knock -Hi -Hi Sorry I left the key at home - Is dad asleep? - You woke him up -Sorry -Hi love Hi dad What's wrong? Nothing I think it's Arman When boys get to this age, they argue all the time He needs to get married to change I don't think it's about Arman It's Bahram Why won't you answer? I'm worried about you Talk to me Are you upset with me? Is there something wrong? -Yes -Ms Samee's house? -Yes -Courier, I'm delivering a package -Come in -Hi -Good day -This package is for you - How much is it? - It's already paid for -Thank you -Bye Unfortunately due to wear and tare damages it's not possible to provide a better copy How many times should I call for you to answer? Why should I be ignored for so long? Bahram I'm human too You come say something, change everything and leave? You're trying to say I'm guilty? Is that it Bahram? Is this what you do Bahram? Is this it Bahram? I know you're home I'm waiting outside your house now Come down, I need to see you We need to talk You've been wandering on the streets and now here -Tell me what you have to say -Should I talk or you? What do you think of me? Am I the cause of your problem? Your relationship with your wife, son, your company's bankruptcy Why won't you answer? I was always the second part of your life You came around whenever you liked Where was I in your life? Nowhere If I stayed with you, it was because I loved you I'd love to have a baby with you, I stood by you through everything But you're not brave enough to talk or make decisions Fine, if you can't make a decision, I will I'll go You stay with your miserable life -Hi -Hi - Can I help you? - Does a Mr Arman Samee work here? Yes, why? If it's about military service he's still in full-time education No it's not about that -He needs to go to the station -Station? - Do you work for him? - No... Yes Give him this summon letter Sign here Pick up Arman Can you believe it Kiana? I went to his office, there was no such thing No one was there, it was empty I asked around, he'd rented the place for a month Then ran away I'm outside this idiot's house see if he's in, if he hasn't ran away -Oh look who's here -You alright Amir? -Come up -Will you come down a second Amir? I've a broken leg, I can't. You come up Hi - Are they here? - Who? Who? The police of course What police? -I said let's sit in the car and talk -Of course I believe you I believed your broken leg too -Otherwise you'd think I'm the fool -Amir where is Sepehr? An address or something You never looked back once you opened the store. I don't know where he is -Dubai, Turkey, I don't know -What do you mean you don't? If I don't find him till tomorrow morning, my life is over -The police is after me -Have some -Tell me, you party with them every night -You know friendships have expiration dates -Just like products -Is that my answer? -No it's my life -Amir I trusted you -I gave them my documents to write the contract then disappeared -Why did you give it to them? I'd promised my friend, I'd lose the store You got the money, you got the store. It's not my problem Stop the nonsense say where Sepehr is Damn my life! Here Come kill me, this is my life This is my life kill me Don't hit yourself dad - You think it makes a difference if I'm dead or not? - Don't dad It's nothing love This is Arash, you'd asked about He's my son Don't pull me in the middle of it. I'm miserable as it is Come love, come here I don't know what the hell to do They have the documents and the contracts. No one knows where they are How many times did I tell you not to hang out with them? You didn't listen Now it's their own problem. You've done nothing wrong to be afraid of I think you need to go in Arman It'll get worse if you don't I'll call you back What? Why the police? -Stop crying, tell me what's wrong -Dad You go to room 21, take a form from there Quiet ma'am I've got the documents -Sorry -His name -His ID number -I don't know it -His father's name -Bahram -He's been bailed out -Bailed out?
