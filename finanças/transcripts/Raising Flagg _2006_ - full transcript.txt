- Me and Gus been playing checkers every Tuesday, must be 20 years now. Of course we been playing one kind of game or another since we were kids. But now it's checkers. Most folks think I'm crazy to keep playing him. It's not that he's smarter than me or a better player, he's just got this way of wearing you down. - That's quite a move flag, you've been cooking that one up for quite a while haven't you? - Take your medicine Gus all the stalling in the world isn't gonna help you now. - Shoot. Oh well. - Maybe it was cocky way he took those checkers off the board, maybe it was the way he wrote down my losing, I don't know. All I know is my whole trouble with Gus started right after that game. - Okay that's 1,278.65. I suppose you wanna let it ride. - Where'd that piece come from? - I put it there three moves ago, I guess you weren't looking very close. - No I was looking very closely, I'm sure it wasn't there. - Just like you're sure I took your shovel last week. - Found the shit didn't you Flagg? - I ain't playing no game of checkers where the pieces move by themselves. ♫ I think I hear the train here coming ♫ Coming down to Caribeo way ♫ Go my ticket in my hand, I've always been a traveling man ♫ That trains coming, today's the day ♫ Don't remind me but I'm leaving ♫ Doesn't really matter in the end ♫ All the money that I wasted ♫ The whiskey that I've tasted ♫ it still comes down to who you call a friend ♫ Well come with the boy down to the station ♫ Did need farewell as I go ♫ Don't you shed a tear as the train rolls down the line ♫ I'm on my way to glory don't you know ♫ Come with the boys down to the station ♫ Did need farewell as I go ♫ - Hey pull it around. Pull it around. ♫ I'm on my way to glory don't you know ♫ - Ada. Ada! Ada. - Good morning Ed. - Ada. - Well I think she's just after his money. Hm. What makes you think that? - Hey Gus. - Hi Ada. - I don't think this is about this woman or how she treats your daddy, I think you're mad at him for the way he treated you and your mama. This is Anne Marie no PhD just common sense Purdy. And I'm talking with Paula. - 12 dollars. - Having a little sex with daddy maybe? My daddy's riding around in his wheelchair having sex. - Where'd she get that stuff? - Not from me. - At 95 you should be able to live with whoever you want don't you think darling? - She's always been real good at figuring these things out. At least for other people. Flagg was gonna fix that fence this morning. - He was up half the night fixing the Campbell's pump. - Morning Flagg. - Flagg. - You know what woke me up this morning? - Your zest for life. - No it was the sound of sheep pissing on my pump house. - I always said you had remarkable hearing for your age. - I can't have sheep pissing on my pump house polluting my water. - I've known you since you fell off the turnip truck Flagg Purdy and this ain't about sheep piss. - You never told me you were gonna bring sheep in over there. - Well I guess forgot to mention that since it's my pastor and my well I figure I can graze elephants there if I want. - Well Purdy's have been using that well since you were a gleam in your daddy's one good eye. Purdy's have always used that well. - And I never charged you for it. - That's right Flagg. - And I told you how I felt about listening to that radio program didn't I? - Flagg lets talk it over come on. - No talking about it. I will not have the sheep over there. - I think you know better than to come in here demanding. - I'm not demanding anything I'm telling you if you keep your sheep over there I'm gonna sue you. - You're gonna what? - I'm gonna sue you. - Now you don't mean that Flagg. - You mule headed flat lander. - You can compliment all you like. I ain't gonna tolerate it. - Okay, okay you go ahead and sue and in the mean time you get off my property. - You ask me you're both sounding like a couple of puffed up roosters. - And you can forget about checkers next week too. Yes sir, forget about it. He's spreading something out there I know he is. We ain't gonna get away with it if you don't take 'em away, we're gonna have lamb stew all winter. - How doing Flagg? - I been better. - When you think you'll be around to clear that brush? - Well I just canceled a fence job so I can be over almost anytime. - Well I hope so. You know what they say. Time waits for no man. - Nice sheep Flagg. - These are the no luck generation of deaf children. - I heard that. - Que dijo? - Not importante. Come on. - If I let him get away with it he will be grazing elephants out there. Spoke to cousin Dale about a lawyer in town. I hate to bring the law into it but we have no choice. - Well you could make amends. - Why can't he make amends for a change? Why is it always me? He's the one that started it. - Be the one to finish it. - No, it's too late. He said some things he shouldn't have said. And besides, there is a principal at stake here. - What principal is that? - Well I forget. But we gotta protect our rights Ada honey. Otherwise people'll be walking all over poor folk. - Seems to me Gus is pretty much poor folks like us. - There you go, protecting him again. - It don't seem right to sue a friend. Goodnight. - He's been getting his way since he was three years old. Time somebody taught him not to be so stubborn. - Well it'll take a little while for people to know that I'm back in town but... No, no, no, there's plenty of legal work in a town this size. With all the lawyers and judges spouting their opinions on TV, everybody's ready to sue with a drop of a hat. Listen I gotta go, somebody just came in. I love you too Mom. Okay, okay. Bye bye. Mr and Mrs. Purdy. What can I do for you? - We know each other? - I used to hang out with Travis. - Oh of course. How are Scooter? - Please sit down. - You the fella that took Travis joy riding in the sheriff's car? - Yeah. That was quite a thing. - Sheriff didn't think so. - Well he got over it. - And now you're a lawyer. - If you think my criminal background's gonna get in the way of me giving you good legal council, I'll be happy to recommend another lawyer in town. - Well my cousin Dale said... - I just opened so I'd be cheap. - Yeah. - What seems to be the problem? - Well this got this neighbor, owns the general store and he over charges people. So they have a choice of either shopping with him or going all the way into town. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now you've been friends with Gus for a long time right? - Yes sir until he started polluting our drinking water with sheep piss. - Sheep piss? - Sheep piss. - Exactly how's he been doing that Mr. Purdy? - Well the way I see it, he's been spreading special treats around my pump house. And when the sheep come to eat the treats... - That makes the... - Exactly. I have never seen sheep piss so much in my entire life. - Mr. Purdy I'm gonna give you a fair assessment of your case. But what I'm gonna need from you are the facts. Not colored by your anger with Gus. Mrs. Purdy you gonna be a party to this case? - Well I am worried about our drinking water too. I know you gotta get this off your mind Flagg and I will stand by you. But I don't believe in suing. So I won't be in on the party. - What are you doing there you running up our bill already? - I can't run up your bill until you hire me. - Well I can't hire you till I know you ain't been in trouble with the law since you was 13. - Are we counting parking tickets? - Good luck Gus. Ain't a nicer man in the county. - We're with you Gus. - I can't wait to get the details on this one. - Here comes the trouble maker now. - Poor Ada having to go through all this. - Hell I'd do the same thing if somebody messed with our water. - I don't think you can park here Flagg. - Oh yeah you can. If it's your case you can. - You wouldn't wanna wade your 10 bucks on his chances would you? - What are you giving odds? - Morning Ada. - Good morning. - Lynette hi. - Mama wait. - Hey Papa. - Hey sweetheart. - I just want you to know I'm right back here okay. - Good, good. - All right good luck Papa. - I don't need to luck sweetheart, I got the law on my side. - Ladies and gentlemen. For the past 30 years, the Purdy family's been getting their drinking water from the well. It's currently owned by their neighbor, Mr. Gus Falk. Now in our state if the Purdy's have been using the well without comment or objection from Mr. Falk for at least 10 years which is the case here. Well then they have the right to continue getting clean, uncontaminated drinking water from the well. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My opponent has stated his case very clearly. There's just one problem. He has no case. Now it's true that Mr. Falk never objected to the Purdy's use of the well. However, on at least one occasion, he granted Mr. Purdy specific permission to use the well in exchange for Mr. Purdy building a pump house over the well. Now it's through that permissive use, that Mr. Falk retains ownership of the well, without interference from Mr. Purdy. - Mr. Purdy has Mr. Falk ever talked to you about the well that you draw your water from? - Yes he did. - What? - Yes he did. - Are you sure Mr. Purdy? - Yeah I'm sure I told him to keep his sheep away from my pump house. - I mean before that. - No I don't recall he ever talked to me before that. - You mean before the sheep started grazing near the well. - It ain't the grazing I'm concerned about it's the pissing. - Mr. Purdy could you please use some other word to describe, perhaps urination would be better. - Sure judge I'll be happy to. You see, the urination is what causes the piss to pollute the drinking water. - I understand that Mr. Purdy. - And I'll tell you something else, he's got 20 acres of land for them sheep to urinate on, so how come they're always pissing in my pump house? - I'm sure that they don't make a decision to go... - I'll tell you why. Diarrhetic treats and he's the one that's doing it. - Objection your honor, there's no evidence to substantiate... - Sustained. - Mr. Purdy, do you remember when you built that pump house for Mr. Falk? - I don't recall maybe 10 years ago. - Well let me refresh your memory. It was 14 years ago this summer. - 10, 14 what difference does it make? - And do you recall the conversation you had with Mr. Falk why you were building the pump house. - Now how in the world am I gonna remember a coversation I had 14 years ago. - Mr. Purdy would you please be more responsive to the questions. - Okay judge. Oh I don't. - Mr. Falk thanked you for building that pump house since it improved the value of his property. Mr. Purdy. - Mr. Purdy. - Sorry judge, I don't remember any stuff. Don't pay no mind. They'll come around once they see we're in the right. - So you gonna come to Jenny's volleyball with us? - You haven't been to a game all year Flagg. - Could be good you know, to kind of keep your mind off of all this stuff. - I don't need to take my mind off nothing. - Well never mind I don't really care anyway. Just so you know your lawyer's gonna cost a lot more than digging a new well wood. This is so embarrassing. - You gonna let your daughter talk to me? - Well she's your daughter too. You get half the blame. - When your toilet backs up on Christmas Eve you'll be singing a different tune. - When Flagg was building that pump house I told that since it would add the the value of my property I'd continue not charging him for water. He couldn't get that through his thick skull. - It would get through all right if you ever said it. - Mr. Reed please control your client. - I'm sorry your honor. - Say objection. - Well I can't object to his recollection. - Why not everybody objects to mine. - Quiet down. - Mr. Falk has there ever been a written agreement about the Purdy's use of the well. - I never saw one. - You ever use the well yourself? - I never needed to but I'm planning to use it one of these days, when I put up some mobile homes on the land. - Mobile homes. - Mr Purdy. - Well, we really have a dilemma here then don't we? I mean it all boils down to Mr. Purdy's word against yours. - That ain't exactly true. - Who are you? - Ed Mclvor I thought I might as well put in my two cents here. - What do you know about this case? - And you say you were present when Mr. Falk and Mr. Purdy discussed the pump house Mr. Purdy was going to build on the adjacent property. - Gus told Flagg he'd count the pump house as payment for the water, that's all. All this fuss over nothing. Until the poker game. - What poker game? - The one we used to play every Wednesday night until Gus and Flagg got in a fight. Ain't played since. - Well what does this got to do with the well? - Flagg called Gus a cheater, Gus got mad and said he couldn't use the water anymore. - I didn't mean that. I was mad. - Mr. Falk sit down. Will you and Mr. Purdy stop jumping up and down like this is a kangaroo court. - When was this poker game? - 11 years ago. - Did Mr. Purdy stop using the well? - He don't know Flagg very well does he Bill. - Why didn't you come forward with this information before now? - How'd I know you needed it, the only reason I come down to the courthouse no one around to talk to. Everyone's here wasting their time. - Thank you Mr. Mclvor. No further questions. - Mr. Reed? - No, no questions your honor. - Wasn't me. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict? - We have your honor. - Although I strongly disagree with the verdict. Unfortunately in this case we must follow the law. The jury finds that the Purdy's have used the well without Mr. Falk's permission for at least 10 years. And therefore have the right to continue getting clean water from that well. - Order, this trial is not over. Quiet down now. - She said quiet. - Yes. - What about the piss? - Mr. Purdy I have had just about enough from you. - Your honor I apologize you are right. But he does have a point. - Yes, yes I know. To protect the plaintiff's right to use the well for domestic water purposes, I will allow him to protect the area within 10 feet of the well with a fence. Court is adjourned, ladies and gentleman thank you for your service, you are excused. Hey, hey, hey! Hey where are you going? Hey, hey! Hey, hey wait. Won't start? - Nope, won't start. - Change the gas since last summer? - No, I didn't. - You know old gas is gonna clog up the carburetor. I can flush it out and drain for you. - Oh that's okay Flagg, I'll do it myself okay. Thanks for coming by. - Tractor working? - Okay Flagg. - You got about four feet of fence knocked out in front. Want me to take care of that? - Nope, I got it Flagg, thank you. - Okay. - Okay Flagg. - Sorry Flagg I couldn't wait no more. Ray's getting real nervous about not seeing him coming. - Seen who coming? - Feds. FBI, CIA, DEA. - Yeah right. Okay well I'll see you next week. - About that you know Scott and Ernie aren't too keen on your whole bow and arrow thing. We're taking AK47's. - Well I'll stick with my bow and arrow that way I give them a fighting chance. - No you know, I think we're just gonna be more without you. - This wouldn't have anything to do with my win in the court case would it? - My daddy says you stole Gus's well. - Well your daddy's wrong boy. You boys are going to need a doctor when they get through burning up poison oak. - Did you touch that with your hands? Did you touch that with... Boys! Get away from there. - Oh I'm real glad you liked them. I'm happy with the brown. - I gotta go. - See ya. You finished the Durban's already? - Boys are doing it. - Oh well I guess you can't blame 'em. It's been nearly a month. - You'd think they was Gus's relatives the way you were siding with them. What'd Rachel want? - Oh she just came by to say hello. - Guess she's got more important things to do than talk to me. - No she was late for a... meet. - I'm sorry Ada. But people don't think it's right for me to have the Purdy name in my store. - I'd never thought I'd see the day you'd hide behind the neighbors Gus Falk. - It's nothing against you personally Ada. - I hear the Millers wanna build a car port. - They already got somebody. There isn't any work for me anywhere. I don't know how we're gonna get by. - Well something's bound to turn up sweetheart. - Yeah when I'm dead and buried. - What happened? - Some kids at school were saying bad things about Mr. Purdy. - They'll forget about it in a few days Jen. - No they won't. Why did he have to do this? - It's just his way. He's got his principals. - I don't really care about his stupid principals. I'm not going back to that school. - What's wrong with that school? Now what did I say? - Oh it's what the kids at school are saying. - It ain't the kids Ada it's their parents. I never took anything in my life that didn't belong to me. - Well I know that Flagg. But people see it differently. - Well I can't be responsible for what people think. Get. Get the hell out of here. Lie down! - Just wants to be near you Flagg. - What's that sign for? - Gus won't sell my eggs anymore. - He can't do that. - Well he done it. - I'm... - Now we had enough of that. - No I won't stand for that. - Now where are you going? - I'm going to the supermarket in town. I'm gonna buy a lot of groceries and I'm gonna drive past his place real slow. - There's Jenny's old man. - Yeah you think he paid for the groceries? - No, no he probably stole them too. What, what? - Yeah. Can't believe she has an old man like that. - Hop in Ed. - My legs are doing just fine. - No come on let me give you a ride. It's the least I can do. You helped me win the case. - If I knew what I was doing I'd never done it. - I have a right to clean water. - I ain't denying your right. I don't like the way you went about getting it. - I did what I thought was right Ed. - Flagg, you're a mean, stubborn, self righteous man. Just like your Pa, only worse. - I'm not like my father. I'm not like my father. - What happened? - Talk about it later. Now what did I do? I can't say anything right. - She was worried about you. - Can't do a damn thing, can't say a damn thing. Doesn't piss somebody off. - Now you go get out of those wet things you'll catch your death a cold. Fix you a cup of hot tea. - Tea ain't gonna help me none. - It's passed 10 o'clock Flagg. Brought you some coffee. You want me to fry you up some sausages? Coffee's there if you want it. - It's come Ada. - What's come? - The coldness in my legs. It comes to all the Purdy's near the end. - They don't feel cold. - They're cold on the inside. - Now I'll get the hot water bottle. - Ada, call the children. - What for? I wanna say goodbye. - I think maybe you got a little cold. - I need to see them. - Okay I'll start calling. - Ada, I'm sorry I ain't been a better husband to you. - I knew what I was getting when I married you Flagg Purdy. All right then you go for you and for you, thanks so much. You know I'll be exclusively selling eggs from right here so I do appreciate you coming out. Okay thanks Linda. See you next week. - Hi. - More trouble at school? - No, teacher meetings. - Well there's some water heating on the stove, would you take the hot water bottle into your Pa. - He's still in bed? Hi. - What are you doing home? Did you quit school? - No, why would I do that? - Well I know the kids have been giving you a hard time. - Thanks. But, I took care of them. - I'm sorry I missed your game Jenny. - It's okay we got killed anyways. - Don't matter I should, I should have been there anyway. - Well you know what basketball seasons coming up and I think they're gonna start me so, you can come to one of those games. - I won't be here. This is for you So you're not late for your games. - Your Timex. Thanks Papa. - Well it's his way of saying he loves you. - He could just say it. - He's feeling a little down because the trial. - But he won. - Well. - This is so stupid. - You wanna help me call your brothers and sisters? He wants to see them. - I'll call Anne Marie. - He didn't say nothing about Anne Marie. My darlings. Hi. Hi. You've been minding your Ma and Pa not fighting? - Yeah. - Well then there just might be some ginger bread cookies on the kitchen table for you. Travis Jr. You ain't bringing no worms into my kitchen are you? Thank you. - Wash your hands before you... - Hey Travis. Look at you. How beautiful grandma. You are so beautiful. Well I'll get the sleeping bags for the children. - Oh don't trouble yourself I'm driving back tonight. We don't want Porter and Travis Jr. to miss school. - Yeah and I'm gonna stay with Tammy's folks. - Well I'm glad you came. The way you sounded on the phone I wasn't sure you'd come. - Well, he thought about it some more. - How are your chickens mama? - Fine. - How's Flagg? - I don't know what the big deal is if it's just a cold. - Well he's acting like he's about to meet his maker. - Well it isn't like he asks you to come everyday. Is Eldon coming? - He should be coming later. - Oh great, we haven't seen him in a long time. Isn't that great Travis? - Yeah. Hey mama we passed Flagg's truck on the way in. Can I fix the flat while I'm here? - Oh that'll be fine Travis. Say hi to grnadpa. - Hello everybody. - Hi grandpa. - Thank you, thank you. Watch your knee. Watch your knee on grandpa. Thank you dear. Thank you. Oh look is that for me? To Grandpa. Look at that. I don't know what it is but I like it very much. Let me see the baby. - Here she is. - Let me see the baby. I'm sorry I'm not gonna get to see you grow up Brittanya. - Flagg you're gonna see all the children grow up. - Are you taking your nap grandpa? - No grandpa's dying Porter. You gonna remember grandpa when he's gone? - Mhm. - Yeah. - I remember when you yelled at daddy. - Grandpa was just kidding sweetheart. - Where you going grandpa? - You ask your Pa to tell you Travis Jr. - Now Flagg don't be giving them any money. - No, no now I can give my grandchildren something to hold to. - Share that with your brother and your sister. - Hey share. - Share it you hear me. - You're supposed to share. Give me! Give me! - Hey, hey okay come on. - I'll see you before you head for home. - Now don't forget your grandpa now hear. I'm okay. Sit Travis. We may not have another chance to talk. - Ma told me that Scooter Reed was back in town. - Yeah he did a pretty good job on the trial too. Just haven't gotten his bill yet. - I guess you can wake up one morning and know you're gonna die. I just never heard of it before. - Purdy's ain't like other people. - You're the master or understatement Flagg. - Yeah. Travis, I want you to have my outboard motor. - Well that's nice of you Flagg but I don't have a boat. - You don't have a boat? - No. - How do you fish? - Well I ain't been fishing since I was Travis Jr.'s age. - Well what are you doing with all them worms then? - Well they're not bait worms Flagg, they're compost and garbage in the fertilizer. - You compost garbage for a living? - I sell the worms that do that. Here. - I'll be damned. I didn't know you were helping the environment. - There's a lot of things you don't know about me Flagg. - Yeah. Like what? Travis, take that board, buy yourself a boat and take the kids out fishing while you can. - It's amazing the insights grandparents get about kids 'cause I would have given anything to have you take me fishing when I was their age. - I don't remember you ever asking. - None of the other kids had to ask. And their Pa's were working. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - You can buy my coffin Travis, make sure it's worm proof. - Well she got a bunch of money from her third or fourth divorce. I don't know. And of course I get an appointment to show her a house. She shows up dressed to the nine, pointing out all the stops just trying to impress me with her money. You know the beamer, the mint coat. The silicon bazoomies out to here. - What? Beverly Baker? No way she was flat as a pancake. - More like five day old roadkill. Honk, honk. So I'm shocked... - He's pissed because I wouldn't take his outboard motor. - You're still eating dairy aren't ya? I can smell it. - You're still raiding worm farmers slightly below people who sell their owns homes aren't you? - Ooo good one. - I'll call you back. Oh my god. - Hello Jenny. - I'm doing my homework. - Mama. Get, get in there. - Jeez already. - That is one hell of a mistake you and papa had. - Whatever he gives you, you take. - Hi papa. - Hi dear. - Here's a fresh one for you. - Thank you. Derek wanted to come but he's working days now so. - Oh, maybe you two can start having a family of your own now that you're sleeping in the same bed at the same time. - You find that funny? - No. I just can't stop thinking about silicon bazoomies. - I'm on my deathbed and you're making jokes. - Oh papa you're not on your deathbed you're just feeling sorry for yourself. - Rachel. - Now that your sister's a big developer she thinks she can insult me. - I'm not a developer. - Your selling houses on prime farmland graden sprawl, what do you call it. - You know if you would just take the time to find out what it is that I do you would know that I'm... - You're the final one to talk! You didn't even come to the courthouse! - Oh and watch you make a fool of yourself. You know if you were just reasonable with Gus. - I will not hear that name in my house. - Linette, I'm gonna go talk to Gus, about helping Gus build those mobile homes that Gus is putting up next door. - Papa, papa, breath, breath, breath. - Sweetheart, go get mama's jewelry box over there. You'll be laughing on the other side of your face when I'm lying out there in a pine box six feet under. Here sweetheart, I want you to have it. - Papa these are mama's. - That's okay I bought 'em for her. - No, no I don't feel right about that. - No, no it's all right dear. They're not real anyway. If you don't want 'em save 'em for your children when you have 'em. Here, here. Give these to her. - I'm out of here. - Papa, breath, breath. breath. - I'm all right now. - Looks like the cold went right to his brain. Time we had a litte talk. - Yoohoo, I've brought my famous funeral casserole. - I'm sure Flagg will appreciate the thought Melinda. - That'll kill him for sure. - I figured with all the youngins coming for the funeral. - Anne Marie's not coming. - Oh, I didn't think Anne Marie was gonna be here. - Sure you did. - I'll tell Flagg you brought it. - Well, I'll be going then. - Ada, who you gabbling with out there? - Oh it's Melinda. She brought you her famous casserole. - Well send her in so I can thank her. - Well hi there. Linda says you both wanna buy some eggs. - How many would you like? Oh that's my son. I gotta greet him. Hello. There you are. How was your trip? - Long. - Look at your and your stuff. Oh good to see you. - Hey. How's the spiritual real estate game. - Don't knock it I bet my congregations bigger than yours. - Yeah I bet it is. Hey there. - How are you. It's good to see you. - Hows Derek? - Oh he's fine. He wanted to come but he had to work today so. - Oh ah, I'm gonna be right back with your eggs. Come with me a minute Eldon. - So hows pop? - I know better. I've been telling the others it's just a cold but, I'm beginning to think it's got more to do with the trial. - How so? - Well I think he knows it was a mistake to sue Gus, and he can't find a way out of it because of his pride. - No wonder you fell in love with them mama. These are beautiful. - Fertilized eggs are supposed to be lower in cholesterol and I figure the market'll brew. Strictly organic. - Hey did you do something new to your hair? - I cut it a bit. - Well it looks nice. Hey Travis. What do robbins do before breakfast? - I don't know, what? - Warm ups. Ha! All right I keep telling the to give it up but they just keep coming up with more worm jokes. - Whatever. - Hows the new church? - Well we're raising the money for the walls while the good lord lays the foundation and I guess it's just my job to make sure everybody knows he's keeping his end of the bargain. - Well you can't count me in for a contribution bro. - Okay. - As long as you'll take a credit card. - Oh yeah we'll max you out. - I hope you can help papa Eldon I really do. - Well I'll try but, you know how he is about being ministered to. - About the same as the rest of us. - So tell me reverend, what's god's cost for new square foot construction? - Well, that's a very complicated question. I don't know. - Square footage. - Oh, mama that's your set. - He insisted I take them Ada. I didn't want to upset him. - Sorry. Mama he can't give away your stuff. - I reckon he can give away anything he wants to in his own house. - Except it ain't just his house. - He's giving away everything they own Eldon, including mama's things. - Mama I think you better get all your things out of there. - You know why don't we just move him out of there and give those sheep something else to piss on. - Will you talk to him son? He listens to you. - It's good to see you son. - It's good to see you too papa. - I can't keep a thing down. - It came on kind of a sudden didn't it? - Yeah well, can't predict these things. - That's true. But I never would of been predicting that you'd be giving away all your things and mama's. - I want people to think kind of me after I go. - Yeah see I told them that had to be it. That it couldn't be that you were seeking salvation. - Who was saying that? Who said I'm not seeking salvation? - You know just... folks, you know how they are. - Yes I do I know how people are. I know how they are. You didn't know my pa did you son? - No he was pretty ill when he died but I do remember being afraid of him. - Yeah he did that to people. - Sang to him on his Bible thumping, his temper. You know nobody showed up at his funeral. Not even family. Just me and ma. Hurt my ma real bad. - You're afraid the same thing will happen to you. You're nothing like your pa. - No. - You know that trial might have been a mistake but it's not too late to change that. - I don't know what good that'll do. - You might be surprised. You can start by getting out of this bed. - This is a good place that I need to wait for the end. Whoa. Here son. Here, here. Here this is for the church building fund. I'd like you to say a few words over me. When my time comes. - Don't they have pills for this kind of thing? - Ther you go lets slip some prozac into his hot water bottle. - I think we should call Anne Marie. - Forget it. - Oh you don't know what it was like between her and papa. - Like when she told him she was marrying Jurvis. - Oh god I thought the roof would come off. I mean a used car salesman for a son in law. - Yeah they're worse than developers. - I thought things would get better after her divorce. - Why should she bother with us? She's a big star. The perfect talk show host. Full of opinions and a big mouth. - You have a nice thing to say about everyone don't you Rachel? - Oh come on Travis it wouldn't hurt her to drive two hours to see mom every once in a while. - Well she does call. - I don't really care what you guys say, mama I know she can help. - Oh my lord. Oh god. - I'm outta here. - Who is it? - Wait Rachel I'm going with you. - Now don't be rude. - Who is it? - Aunt Edith. - It's your uncle Ben's widow. She hasn't been here since before you were born. - God what a family. - You'll get used to it honey. - Hello Purdy's. - Hello Edith. It's been a long time. - I heard my brother in laws dying. I guess there's some justice in the world after all. - Oh no Edith. - If you're gonna start with your nasty comments, you can just march yourself out here they way you come in. - I'm sorry Ada, you never did appreciate my humor. I'm here to pay my respects. - How'd you find out? - Nothing the Purdy's do in this county I don't hear about. Lets see now, this is... - Linette. - You moving back to town Eldon? - I wasn't planning on it. - I thought you might. 'Cause praying for Flagg is a full time job. Well Travis, I'm surprised to see you here. - You're not the only one aunt Edith. - He is part of the family Edith. - You come to sell the house Rachel? - Hello? - Is that because she never could stand the smell of pigs. Now, now who's this one here? - It's our youngest, Jenny. - She must have your jeans Ada. You sure are growing up in the right places sweetheart. - You know what aunt Edith, I have to be going. So you take care now. - I come visit once in 20 years, you can't stick around for a few minutes. - No, I'm sorry. I'm late for the doctor so I gotta get going. So, bye bye. - Flagg ain't got nothing that's catching does he? - We're not sure. - We ain't been that close of a family child. I gotta tell you. I sure miss having family. So, where is the old coop? You look like hell. - Come to cheer me up did you? - I could recommend a good mortician. Remember what your pa always said We all gotta go sometime. And the sins of the father shall be visited upon the sun. I brought you some of Ben's things. Maybe they'll comfort you in the end. - You should of told me his time had come so I could of made my peace with him. - There's only one way to find peace Flagg. Right in all your wrongs. - So you're taking Spanish now I take it here. - Yes. - Do you have... - I hate it. - Do you have Mrs. Walsh? Oh my god, can you tell me how to say I know I want a beer because I'm gonna sneak into a bar very soon. - It's mamacita. - Egg money? - Egg money. - He gave it to me. - What the heck is she talking about? - But you can't let her take your bed mama. - Giving away the bed is like giving up on us being together. - But do you remember when I had to watch that TV show, for biology class remember. It had the live birth. - I won't tolerate that kind of thing in my house. - And he took the TV and he threw it in the crack. - Oh it's still down there I saw it this morning on my walk. It is. - You could see the rabbit ears sticking out. - Do you remember that time when Travis failed health? That one semester, and papa goes down to the school and he says, you can't fail my son! You can't fail my son, he's healthy! He's never been sick a day in his life! - Yeah. - Do you think we should be laughing like this with him laying in there? - Oh please. - Travis, you didn't happen to see Jenny downtown did you? - No I was hanging out with Scooter doing some catching up. Why? - She's usually home by now. - Well please let me know if you hear from her Lupe. And could you call Jeff, okay then thanks. She wasn't at practice. Lupe thinks she went some place with her friend Jeff. - I'm gonna call the sheriff. - No, no. Travis, lets go look for her. - Well that's a good idea. Why don't you two go along and I will keep the supper warm. - Well I'll go with you. - No, no, no. Rach let me and Eldon do it. - Oh. - She come home yet? - No. Boys went looking for her. - She run off because of me Ada. - Now don't out that on yourself too. - I heard them laughing out there. They're all gonna be happy when I'm gone. - They were just having fun. They were remembering when they was growing up. There is no one of them that wouldn't do anything they could to make you well. - Eldon says I have to forgive myself. - Well Eldon's pretty smart about such things. - What goods a preacher that tells you what to do but don't tell you how to do it. Boil them duds Ada honey. You cold? - Oh I was just a little chilly so. - Mama, telephone. - Hello? - Hi mama, don't worry Jenny's here with me. - Oh thank goodness. - She just popped in at the station and surprised me. She got a ride from one of her friends. - Oh I guess I should have known. She's been talking about nothing but you helping papa. - How are you doing? - Well to tell you the truth, I'm worried about him. - Really? Well I'm gonna put Jenny on the early train tomorrow. - Why don't you come with her? Maybe she's right, maybe you can help. - Oh having me there would probably sink him completely. - Well won't you think about it Anne Marie? - No I think I've been through all this with Jenny. I got my show in the morning. But I love you mama. - I love you too. Bye. - Is she coming? - I'm so going to live like this one day. But maybe in San Francisco or LA. - One of the ambitious Purdy's. - Well I'm definitely going to get out of there like you did. - Well you'll do it a lot better way than I did. If I have anything to say about it. - Was it hard, with Jurvis I mean. - There are easier ways to grow up. - What is that? - It's sushi. - Okay. Mmm. It's good. So Anne Marie, why don't you come home? I mean, are you really still that mad at papa? - Well I think I'm over that. I'm not really sure how he would react. - Well I think that you should know even though papa doesn't let us to listen to your show in the house, mostly all of us do anyway. And I know that you can change things I mean I listen to you on your show. If you came home, I hear you helping people every single day on your show. - You know that that's not my own family. - Yeah but if you just talk to him. I know I don't really know what went on between you guys but I really do believe that he respects you. - That doesn't mean that he wants me to come back home. - So you're not even gonna try. - You really love him a lot don't you? - I don't even know anymore. I mean he won't listen to a thing any of us have to tell him. Not that he really ever has anyway. But like I've never seen him do anything like this before. I mean he will not get out of bed. And it's not like I really do want him to die either. - He's not going to die. - You don't know that you haven't seen him. - You want this or should I pack it up for the worms? - I won't tell the worms if you don't. Thank you mama. - Mama. - Anne Marie. Oh you came. - Oh how are you? - Oh well I'm a little tired. - Yeah? - And I can't sleep any place but my own bed. Well at least it used to be my own bed. - Are you wearing all of your clothes? - Well yes I am. It's s long story. - Well you look gorgeous no matter what you got on. - Guys come inside it's freezing. - Oh my gosh look at you here. - Hey mama, Jenny said you haven't called the doctor yet, how come? - Oh well I tried but you know your pa. Why should I spend good money for some doctor to tell me what I already know. - Hey stranger. - Hi Mr. Ponytail. - Ada, is that Jenny? - She'll be right in. - Okay. I might as well, get it over with. Thank you. Okay. - Nobody told me you were coming. - Well I didn't know I was myself until this morning. - And why'd you run off why'd you do a fool thing like that? - I can visit my sister if I want to. - Not without telling us so. - Well there wasn't time. - You scared me and mama half to death. Don't run off when I'm talking to you! - She's glad to see you too. Well I'm happy to see her but she shouldn't have done that. She shouldn't have run off without telling anybody. - Well maybe you could get her a pager so you could keep track of her. - Yeah that's all we need, teenagers with pagers. As if those cellular phones wasn't bad enough. - Hey that's a good idea you could get her one as a Christmas gift. Or you could just you know hire a private detective to keep track of her. - Well you haven't changed a bit have you? Still as contrary as ever. - The fact that I'm here should tell you that I have changed quite a lot. - Well it took my dying to get you here didn't it? - Yes. - I was right about Jurvis wasn't I? - I don't know how I've been able to live my life without your advice. - Yeah. - He has a lot of problems but he's a good man. We were just, too young to get married and I was too anxious to get away from here. - Well there's a lot more to be said on that subject isn't there? - Great to see you too papa. - He gets me so mad. - You have to learn to stand up for him. You know instead of running away like I did. That's something that would help you and help everybody else around here too. - Ada, I'd like my hot water bottle. - You know slavery was abolished in 1863 mama. - Jenny's right mama. - Maybe should I ignore him, see if that makes him feel better. - Well that's not what she means mama. - Well, I know what she means. You just ain't used to seeing him sick like this Jen. And till we can figure out a better way I'm gonna be a slave or whatever else it takes to show him I love him. - Well while you're showing him that you love him could you just take off some of the clothes 'cause I feel really, really hot just looking at you. - Well where am I gonna put 'em? - Well you can put everything in my car. - Come in. - Andrea, Sarah! Hi! - Ada. What's all that ruckus out there? - It's Anne Marie's friends and they're here to see her not you. - Has everybody in this family gone crazy? - Well I'm not exactly sure why you all asked me here because I don't think there's anything wrong with him really. - That's about the only thing I've ever agreed with you on. - Rach, Rach, Rachel. Rach you would have died. - Jenny gave it to him head on. They're Anne Marie's friends they're here to see her not you! - Who told you to do that? - Nobody told me. - You sure Anne Marie didn't tell you to do it. - Yeah I'm sure. - She did exactly the right thing. I mean she stood up to him instead of walking away into your own eggshells. - What makes you the expert? - If he gets all riled up he'll just get out of this funk, this. - Can't I just put Rachel in there with him for five minutes. - Wait can I say something. You know that new age psycho babble may work on your radio show. But it's not gonna do diddly swat for him. - You know can we just now get into... - He's dying. He's dying. Let him go in peace. - Oh my god. Travis. Don't even say that. - He's not dying. - He's just depressed. - Are there any more cookies? - You could have the rest of this one. - No these aren't right for you blood type. - Oh well thank god the cookies are right for my blood type. - You know stirring up his anger might not be a bad idea. - When he does get angry he does get moving. - Gus. - What's that sweetheart? - If you wanna get him mad. I mean god forbid anybody mentions the G word around here. - Oh wow. - God how beautiful it is out here when it snows. - Okay come on, lets keep moving. - Papa. - Hello dear. - Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Can I get you anything else? - No I'm fine. Where's ma? - She went for a walk with Rachel and Anne Marie. - Can I maybe get you some tea or something? - I won't have it. - No. - You're the only one of my children that cares whether I live or die. - Or no that is not true papa. It's just not. We all care. - Well I feel it from you. I don't feel it from nobody else. Things are gonna better for you Linette. I know they will. - I know. I always have hope. - Okay. You didn't have to prove anything to us. We can see what great shape you're in. - I don't have to prove anything to you. - Are you still mad about Jurvis? - I could of had Jurivs anytime I wanted him. - There was nothing going on between you two so why are you making such a big deal out of it still? - Who told you there was nothing going on? - He told me, he only took you out once. - Yeah. It's just that you were too afraid to tell me that you were gonna go out with him, it was easier for you to run away. Just like it's easier for you to deal with everybody elses problems instead of dealing with your own. - Okay so this is not about Jurvis, this is about how I live my life. - Look, if you think I'm jealous of you, you can forget it because I have been in the million dollar sales club for three years. - Rachel. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I ran away and I didn't tell you about him. I thought if I came home I could maybe clear things up. But... - Well it wasn't really a date. We just parked behind the high school and made out. - Oh. Guess what I heard about Jurvis? - Remember how I ate these? No more. - You loved them. - Very bad area. - Hey Jackson you want one of those? How about this one? No? Okay. Okay get grape. Hi Rachel it's good to see you. - Gus. - Yeah. Anne Marie. - Hi. - Hi Anne Marie I really enjoy your show I listen to it. - Oh thanks, it's good to see you. - You too, Anne Marie yeah. Ada, I've been thinking a lot about this whole thing and what I did troubles me it just isn't right. I'd be glad to sell your eggs again. - Well thank you Gus. I'll think on it. - How's Flagg? - No better. - I'd come over and pay my respects if i didn't think it would make things worse. - Now isn't that an interesting idea. I walked right into that one. - Mama, I thought you'd be happy that Gus would sell your eggs again. You sure could use the money. - Well I've been doing some figuring and I made more money last week than I do in a month selling through Gus. I don't think I need a middle man anymore. - Oh you fox. - What are you doing mama? What's going on? - Hi Linette. - Hi Gus. - He's in the bedroom. - Is he sleeping? - I don't know. - What's he doing here? - It's a long story. Never even played checkers this long. - Travis, Eldon, it's good to see you. Nice fence Flagg put up by the pump house. Could use some paint though. Sure is a nice day. I'll see you tomorrow. - What? - Yeah that's what we'd like to know. - Yeah what's Gus so happy about? - We came to an understanding. - What kind of understanding? - I gave him back the rights. His lawyers drawing up the papers. - Lord mercy. - After all that time and money you're just... - What are you getting so upset about? It's a good deal. He's gonna drill us a new well. - I don't believe this. - Yeah I should have never gone to court in the first place. We just put things back the way they were. - You're missing the point Flagg. Those rights belong to both of us. Well I'm sorry I can't do anything right. But you won't have to put up with it much longer. - Poor papa. Must be hard to be rejected by everybody. - Well it is. - And it must feel terrible to feel like you're dying and no one understands you. I know what you're doing. - Even though you've been a good husband and a good father. - I'm not gonna fall for it. - And we all see that the husband and the father that took care of all of us and had to support us all. - That was hard. - I know that. The rest of the family knows that. We love, we support you, we understand that you've been a good husband even though at times you've been difficult to live with but we love you. - I don't need to hear no radio program psychology lady. - Do you know that we all love you papa? - No. - We wouldn't all be here if we didn't love you. That's why we're all here. We're here 'cause we love you and we worry about you. - I don't wanna talk about it right now. - Why don't you just get up out of that bed. - I'm not getting out of the bed. - Come on. - I'm dying. - But daddy what I'm trying to say is you can get out of the bed... - I'm dying. - All right lets go. - So, what do we do now? - Well I don't rightly know. I'm afraid your pa'll just up and die out of pure stubbornness. - What will you do then mama? - Since you're all grown, the only thing I've known is taking care of him and Jenny. And my chickens. It's pretty sad ain't it? Well, he'll be wanting his hot water bottle about now. - Papa's not the only one who needs to get out of the house. - Mommy. - What's that? - Hey mama. Excuse me I'll take this. - Now what are you doing? - Thank you very much. - Now will you tell me what this is all about? - Okay shh. - Okay Linette. Linette. - Tada. - Whoa. - Beautiful mama. - Mama where are the gingerbread cookies? - Mamacita. - What's going on? - Oh not bad for such short notice Travis. Mama, this gentleman insists on taking you out for a date this evening. - My mama taught me never to go out on a date unless I know exactly where I'm going. - I know your date and I know what he's driving and I strongly recommend that you take some tab money. - We're going dancing mama. Come on, - Dude green means go, red means stop. - Ada, where you going? What's going on? - This is brilliant. - Oh thank you but I wish you didn't have to be high to tell me. - Grass is very natural. - What's going on? Where you going? - Mama I haven't had such a serious date in years. - Thank you for doing this. And for coming to see your pa. I know it wasn't easy for you. - I'm glad I came mama. - Travis, would you mind taking a little side trip. Well it's been so long since I did anything like this, I don't know how to act. - Just act natural. Everybody will handle the rest. ♫ Well come with the boys down to the station ♫ Did need farewell as I go ♫ Don't you shed a tear as the train rolls down the line ♫ I'm on my way to glory don't you know ♫ - Why Ada, it is so good to see you. Hello Travis. - Hello Mrs. Cooper. - What's going on with Flagg? - Well it's hard to tell. But this is my date tonight. - Where's your ma? - She went out for a while. - She went out? - Yeah she, went out with Travis. - Went out with Travis? Where'd they go? - There's a dance tonight at The Grange. - A dance at The Grange, she went to a dance at The Grange? What she do a damn foolish thing like that for? - Why, 'cause she felt like she'd been cooped up here much lately. - Well it was good enough for her to be cooped up before I was dying. - Yeah but, all that's changing now isn't it? - I suppose she'll be doing a lot of that kind of thing then huh. Dancing carried on. - Yeah I see all the time in my line of work. How quickly widows become free spirits. - You don't suppose she's found somebody else already do you? - Well she is a mighty fine looking woman. - Yes. Yes, that's a problem isn't it? That is the problem. ♫ I'm on my way to glory don't you know ♫ - Can I have the first dance? - You'll have to wait your turn Foster. ♫ Since I walked down that road ♫ And I still don't know why ♫ I was a young man ♫ I didn't know ♫ - We're not careful we'll be an item in tomorrow's paper. This brings back a lot of memories. The school dances. Hayrides. And hikes to the falls. I know, I know, I know. It's not right to... To pry on you in those days. But it really struck me when you came without Flagg. - Felt strange to me too. - Well, whatever happens you won't ever have to worry about anything. I'll always look after you. - I don't need anybody to look after me Gus Falk. Now if you really cared about me you would do something to support Flagg. - You think this is about him being jealous? - He's always believed that there's still something between you and me. - I sure would not mention that we were dancing together tonight. - Flagg. Flagg? You want some tea? - How was the dance? - Fine. Gwen and Foster said to say hello. And Gus. We even danced. One dance. - He couldn't wait till I was gone before he started to pounce. - Now don't get yourself all worked up over nothing. - You never even thought about dancing until Anne Marie got here. - I wasn't thinking about a lot of things. - Next thing she'll be taking you to chippendales. - Don't go blaming anything on Anne Marie. She only come to make amends with you and you didn't exactly welcome it. - I heard what she said. - She wants you to accept her no matter what mistakes she made. That's all any of our kids ever wanted from you. - Kids should know how I feel about them by now. - Sometimes it's hard to tell for sure. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. - Ada? I wanna show you something. My pa wrote this to my mom when they just got married. He wrote it before I was born. Read it out loud. - Dear little wife of mine, Here I am sitting in my cold room thinking of what I am missing at home. - He was driving for a long distance hauler at the time. - My beautiful little wife has a world of plans that I'm doing everything I can to help come true. When we were single I thought I was in love with you. But at that time I didn't know what love was compared to how much I love you now. The X's I put on the bottom of this letter are kisses for you. Save all your love for your lonesome husband. So lonesome sweetheart. Love Hugh - I didn't know the man that wrote that letter. The man I knew couldn't write such things. - The man who wrote this was filled with love. He might have been angry and confused but he was still a decent man and he loved you. - I have a hard time believing that. - Well you keep trying. Papa's having trouble forgiving himself. You think forgiving his pa would do just as well? - It's not really a question of who he forgives, it's the forgiving that counts you know. Letting go of his anger. - The whole thing hinges on forgiveness. Forgiveness is like a key that opens a door in the heart and when that door is open then the lord can... Sorry. - No that's okay Eldon you're absolutely right. - Well I wanna hear from you Eldon. - You know it's funny how a little water can start something so complicated. - What? Mama? What is it? - I'll be right back. - Ada. Ada what's going on? What's going on? What the hell are you doing woman! - I'm just seeing how firm the mattress is. - Ada. Ada! Ada. Ada. - Don't waste your breath. I think she went over to Gus's place. - What are you doing? - I just wanna see where it'll best fit in my bedroom. - Well it don't fit no where 'cause it ain't going no where! - That's what I get for trusting you! This time they're gonna throw you in the slammer! - Now what's got into you? - You know damn well what's gotten into me. - See I thought we settled this yesterday when you were on your death bed. - That was before you turned my water off! - Turned your water off, Andy have I been out of this store today? - We've been putting up stock all day Mr. Purdy. - Well then you hired somebody to do it! - Why would I do a fool thing like that when you gave the water rights back to me? Andy why don't you go and chop me some fire wood will you? Okay. Doggonit Flagg. You haven't learned a thing from all this have you? Now Ada and I were dancing last night. That's not what this is about is it? - No. - I respected Ada's decision when she decided to marry you. And that has not changed. She loves you Flagg. Now, you go home and I'm sure you'll figure out what happened to your water. I'm sure it's the breaker. - You're right. - Sure I'm right I mean that breakers old. - No I mean about me not learning anything. - I'm sorry. I was wrong. You have learned something. You apologized to me yesterday for what you did and today just now you listened to me. Pa you were hopping mad I know how hard that is for you. - Well it's hard for you too. - Yeah it's hard for me too. I'll tell you what. I think maybe I've been too set on beating you at whatever we do. - Well I'm glad to hear you finally admit it. - I will try to change that. - Okay. I will too. - So checkers tomorrow? - Yeah. Usual time. - No Porter grandpa's not dead yet. Porter give the phone back to mommy. Okay sweetheart. I'll talk to you later. Love you, bye. Amy can't get here until tomorrow. So its it okay if I stay here tonight? - Hey, your welcome. Guys. Mama has something she wants to tell everyone. About your eggs. - Oh well. I spoke to the manager at the supermarket in town about not selling organic eggs and so next week there will be Purdy Eggs in their cooler. - Hey way to go mama. - You guys, he's coming. - Glad you're up and about. - Well there's a lot of work to do. Not gonna have time for a lot of dancing. - Well dancing's exactly what you need Flagg Purdy. - Yeah. - Everynight. - What time's that show of yours on? 9:00 AM Monday through Friday. AM610. - I'll try to watch it. - You done good papa. - Thanks for your help Eldon. - I did very little. You did hard work, and thank you for giving me the inspiration for this weeks ceremony. - Is the road to forgiveness paved with gifts. - Send me a tape. I'm gonna bring the outboard over one of these days and we're gonna take the kids out fishing. - Okay pop. - Okay. - Papa. I'm really glad you're up. - A lot of fuss over nothing. - Papa. - Yeah? - There's a little gift on the kitchen table from all of us. - Oh okay. Well I don't know what I learned from the whole thing. What that checkers game or that forgiving business had to do with it. But it really doesn't matter much. What does matter is we got through it. And even with all our differences, we're still a family. You know it's not easy to get your wife and children to change. But laying in bed like that sure seemed to help. Maybe I learned that.
