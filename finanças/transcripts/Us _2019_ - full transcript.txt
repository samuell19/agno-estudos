Thousands of miles of tunnels run across the United States. Abandoned subway lines, road networks and deserted mines. Many are no longer in use. Tonight's storm is causing all kinds of problems around the bay. Bea Givens will have the forecast. And we'll show you what would happen to the bay if some scientist's predictions come true. All on 7 at 11. What has 12 million eyes, 192 million teeth, and stretches from the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to the Twin Towers? It's Hands Across America. A 4,000-mile-long chain of Good Samaritans standing hand-in-hand through fields of grains, past purple mountains, and across fruited plains from sea to shining sea. That's right! This summer, 6 million people will tether themselves together to fight hunger in the United States. Visit your local record shop to find out how you can be a part of Hands Across America. Put some meat on that one. Yeah, I guess I missed my chance to go pro. Oh, shh... Tell you what... Right now, you could walk away with a prize from the second level or you could keep going for a prize from the third level. Okay, what do you think, Addie, should we stop... or keep going? Don't look at me, it's your birthday. I want number 11. Yeah? That one? - Yeah. - All right. Uh, yeah, that one. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Yeah. That shirt better not give her nightmares. In trouble for winning my daughter a t-shirt. Haha, that's a new one. She was terrified when that came on TV. You know... You know they're filming something by the carousel, you should see if they're looking for extras. Ahh, I need another beer. - Hm. - I can't have a beer now? Hey, how about the Big Dipper? Addie, do you wanna try it? Russel, you know she's not big enough to do that. And I, sure as hell, am not doing it, so. Whac-a-Mole! Yeah, Whac-a-Mole guy, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout! How many tickets? - Two tickets. - Two tickets! Two tickets! - Hey, Addie, come to the bathroom. - I don't have to go. Russel? Russel. Can you watch your daughter, please? I'm watchin'! Baby, stay close, okay? Oh, my God! And Sotuknang went to Taiowa and said, I want you to see what I have done, I have done well. Taiowa looked and said, It is very good, but you are not done yet.

You should run while you're here. Jason, eat something. Something. What? What's with all the attitude? I'm sorry. Yay! Track and field. Whoa. You don't want to run anymore? You love track and field. Eh, what's the point? The Olympics. I'm not gonna make it to the Olympics, guys. You could do anything you set your mind to. Can I drive while we're here? - No. - No. Well, that's what I set my mind to. Where are you going, Jason? - Jason? - I'm getting something. You need to come and finish your food. Sarah and Hailey drove with parent supervision. Yeah, well, you don't need to know how to drive when you're an Olympic-caliber athlete. My God. You run. You run on the sand. Why? Because it's harder. Okay? No traction. Practice on the beach, you get on dry land, you take off. We're going to the beach? Yeah. Well, later, once we get settled. What beach? Santa Cruz. Josh, Kitty and the girls are gonna be there. What are you doing? It's a magic trick. I left it here last year. Okay, let's see it. This thing's kinda bullshit. Hey! What, are we cursing at the table now? When you point a finger at someone else, you have three pointing back at you. What's that supposed to mean? That's four fingers pointing back at you. So, what is it? I think she has post-traumatic stress disorder. She wasn't in 'Nam. Okay, she got lost. For 15 minutes, that's... That can be very scary. You don't know what happened to her. Anything coulda happened to her. Okay, so-so, h-how do we get her to talk? Look, I think we need to encourage her to draw, to write, to dance. Anything to help her tell us her story. I just want my little girl back. It's gonna be okay. I need to have a smoke. We have a summer home by the beach and don't go to the beach. What about the beach right here? What beach? There is a beach right there. That is not a beach. That is a bay, that is a shore. I'm talking about a real beach with people and sand, an amusement park. There's, like, it's crowded there, and, like... There's weirdos at the beach... I-I'm not going to that beach. We're not going. Okay, I guess I can just cancel then. Okay. It just sucks, is all. I mean, you know, Jason really was looking forward to it. It's the first time we've been back here since Grandma died. I know it's been pretty hard on him. We leave before dark. Yeah. Yes. Yes. It's gonna be great. You're gonna enjoy it. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Are you really not gonna kiss me? Mm-mm. You not gon' kiss me? Hmm? Where's your brother? Your brother, where is he? I don't know. Really. Jason? Baby, that's why you can't play in here. Didn't this happen last year? Zora, please. Yeah! That's right! What is this? Daddy's next home, baby! Craw Daddy! Ha-ha! He's kidding, right? He is not kidding. It's got a cassette player and everything! Bucket seats! Storage compartments! Wow. That's right. It's even got one of these, baby! Oh, I got it, I got it. They taught me how to do this. It veers a little to the left, so you gotta hold on to it. Least, I got it really cheap. Will we all fit, though? You know, what? Y'all are spoiled. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Spoiled! Did you know that there's fluoride in the water that the government uses to control our minds? I forgot, nobody cares about the end of the world. Maybe you could just tell us what's supposed to happen and then we can picture it. Maybe you could kiss my anus, Zora. - Ew! - Whoa, whoa! Anus isn't a cuss word. Why are you even talking about anuses? Why would you say that? I would've actually, preferred you use a curse word, in this case. Mom, I can see you laughing. I am not laughing.

I think about murdering him sometimes. - So nothing's changed, huh? - Nope. Ooh, actually... A little something has changed. Oh, my God. Did you get something done? Just, like, an itsy-bitsy little- little thing. Oh, God. Well, you look just like you did last year. Oh, thank you. Well, I mean, that's the idea, you know. Just a little bit can go a long way. Not that you need anything, whore. What was it? Just a stupid tunnel. Ugh, destroyed such baby shit. Your brother's so weird. He just has a hard time focusing. Are you going in the water? No. - Why not? - Yeah, why not? Hey, where are you going? To the bathroom. - Why don't you pee in the ocean? - Why don't you pee in the ocean? - Jinx. - Jinx. - Double jinx. - Double jinx. - Triple jinx. - Triple jinx. - Blackout. - Blackout. - Shut up. - You shut up. Did you ever wish you'd kept dancing? Sometimes, yeah. 'Cause you were, like, really good, right? Yeah, well... I peaked at 14. Oh, I mean, didn't we all? I think I could have been a movie star. If the girls hadn't been born at exactly the wrong time. I went to Stella Adler. I was on two commercials before I met Josh. San Francisco was a career killer. Jesus! Watch it! Uck. That's crazy. Been having so many crazy coincidences lately. Jason! - Jason! - Jason! - Where were you? - I went to the bathroom. No! You don't do that. You don't run off without telling me. - Ow. - I'm sorry. Okay, okay, we're all good. We're good. All right. I think we're gonna head out. - Yeah. - Okay? You saw their new car, right? He had to do it. He just had to get that thing to fuck with me, too. That's mission accomplished. Don't run inside! Way to freak Mom out. I'm gonna go say goodnight. 11-11 tied in the 7th inning. You good? I'm just gonna watch the Giants highlights, okay? I'll see you later in the magic room. - Night, night. - Good night. Phone off. Mask off. You thought I was dead. Oh, no, I just... I just didn't know if you were lost, or taken or... By terrorists and perverts? Stick with me. I'll keep you safe, okay? Look. 11:11. Bedtime. Who's this? I was thinking about getting some fishing gear tomorrow. Four rods, we could all go, fish off the dock. You know? Of course, there's the boat, too. I'm just sayin', if we could get out there in open water... I'm not trying to force anyone. Hey. Gabe, I wanna go. Where you tryin' to go? I can't be here, I... It's too much. You serious? Being here, it, um... It feels like there's this, um... black c-cloud just hanging over me and, uh... I don't feel like myself. I think you look like yourself. Okay, yeah. When I was a kid, I went to that boardwalk with my parents. I wandered off. I don't know why, I just did. I ended up in that hall of mirrors. There was another girl in there. She looked like me. Exactly like me. You were in the hall of mirrors... She wasn't a reflection. She was real. She was real. Sh-She... I ran as fast as I could. My whole life, I've... I've thought that she's a devil coming for me. Okay, well, whatever happened happened a-a long time ago, right? You know, how sometimes things line up? - Yeah. - You know, like, coincidences? Since we've been here, they've been happening more and more. I think... I feel like it means, like, she's getting closer. Who? The mirror girl? You don't believe me. I-I-I do. I do. I'm processing, okay? It's just... I can't believe you kept all this inside you so long. You know I'm here, right? I'm pretty sure I can kick your ass so if she looks like you, then... Okay, bad joke. All right, I'm sorry. My bad. I'm just trying to lighten the mood. Shit. We lost power. Perfect timing. See, this is why Josh has a backup generator. Jesus! Okay, we lost power, go back to bed. There's a family in our driveway. There is not a family in our driveway. Huh. Who is that? It's a family. Y'all scared of a family? The boogeyman's family Okay, all right, enough- enough of that. Uh-uh. - Hey, hey, hey. - No. What? Zora, gimme your phone! - I'm not on it. - Zora! Is someone outside? It's just a family standing outside. It's probably the neighbors. You're kidding me, right? Hello, my name is Adelaide Wilson. Are you seriously calling 911 right now? Hurry up? We lost power. All right, sure, okay. - Yes. - You know what? - What? - I'm gonna fix this. - No, we don't... - I'll find out - What? - Who they are. No, they haven't but I know they're gonna... Everything's gonna be fine. Calm down, okay? No, no, no, that's too long! No! You don't understand. How about we all just try to keep calm? - Gabe... - Dad... Keep our heads and everything's gonna be all right. Don't... w-w-wait, just one second. Gabe! Can't I have a vacation and my whole family lost their goddamn minds. Hi. Can I help you? Okay. If y'all out here trying to scare people, I think you picked the wrong house for that. Zora. Put your shoes on. Aight. I asked you nice. Now, I need y'all to get off my property. Okay, let's call the cops. I did. They're 14 minutes away. What? 14 minutes? Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Jason, give me the bat. What bat? The baseball bat, the bat! There's one in the corner. - Here. - Thank you. - Gabe. - All right, hold on. - Let's just try this again. - Gabe. No, no, no, no, no. All right. - Gabe! - I got this, I got this. Now, I thought I already done told y'all to get off my property! Okay? So if y'all wanna get crazy, we can get crazy! Now, the cops are already on their way. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! They're going around. Is the back door open? - Back door's open. - Zora, no! Gabe, Jason! Now, I'm serious, man! I will break your heads! If I were you... Gabe! - The key! - What? - The hide-a-key! - Hide-a-key? Hide-a-what, shit! Shit! Oh, my God. Just stay close. What's going on? What? It's us. We don't have anything here. - This is our summer home, - Gabe. We just got in today, so... Once upon a time, there was a girl. And the girl had a shadow. The two were connected. Tethered together. When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty. But when the shadow was hungry, she had to eat rabbit raw and bloody. On Christmas, the girl received wonderful toys. Soft and cushy. But the shadow's toys were so sharp and cold. They'd slice through her fingers when she tried to play with them. The girl met a handsome prince and fell in love. But the shadow, at that same time, met Abraham. It didn't matter if she loved him or not. He was tethered to the girl's prince, after all. Then, the girl had her first child. A beautiful baby girl. But the shadow she gave birth to a little monster. Umbrae was born laughing. The girl had a second child. A boy this time. They had to cut her open and take him from her belly. The shadow had to do it all by itself. She named him Pluto. He was born to love fire. So you see, the shadow hated the girl so much for so long. Until one day, the shadow realized she was being tested by God. Excuse me. Excuse me. What do you want? You could have my wallet. You could have the car. Gabe. You could have the boat, for all I care. Nobody wants the boat, Dad. How 'bout this? You take me to the ATM... What are you people? We're Americans. Tether yourself to the table. Addie, don't do it. Maybe I should cut something off of you. It's... It's okay. Don't hurt my children. Yo. Hey, hey, hey! No! Stop, please. Get off me, man! - Gabe! - Daddy! Please, please, please! Stop! Stop, please! Gabe! Wait! Wait! Okay. Okay. Mom. Little girl. Run! Go. You want me, right? He's not going. Careful. He has a te-emper. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not. Oh, shit. Okay. Don't be scared. Look at me. You're gonna be okay. Show him one of your tricks. Okay. Go play, boys. Don't burn our house down. Stop. Please, stop. Stop it! Please, no, no! What the fuck? Get off my car! Come here! Come... goddammit, get your ass over here! I said, come here. Kid, I'm talkin' to you. What do you want? What? What do we want? We want to take our time. We've been waiting for this day for so long! I call it the Untethering. That's yours. It hangs to the left. It hangs to the goddamn left. Jason? Jason? Come here. It's your dad! Run! Hey! Come on, come on, come on. Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go! Josh, what was that? What? I heard something outside. Okay. Rustling. Walking, like a person. There's a person walking outside our fucking house. Could be a squirrel. I don't know. Would you please get up and look? I'm busy. I'm... I'm busy. So. Maybe it's a-a pizza guy. Maybe the girls ordered pizza. Get up and take a look, I'm scared. Aw, I don't want to. I wanna stay down here. I wanna just stay in my cozy spot. Get up and look. Jesus Christ. Hey, uh, Ophelia, lights up. Lights up. I think I heard the backup generator go on, too. What do you know about the backup generator? Can you stop being an asshole for two seconds? Just look. All right, I'm lookin'. With my binoculars. I see nothing. I see beautiful stars. Are you really looking? Yeah, I'm looking. Oh, shit, no. Yeah, I... There's somethin' out there. Don't fuck with me, Josh. I'm not fucking with you. I'm serious. There's something out there. Look. Look behind the car. Where? I don't see it. - By the car! Look. - I can't... Ho, shit! What? Oh, my God, it's OJ. It's OJ Simpson! What is wrong with you? Seriously? Ophelia, gimme some Beach Boys. - Playing "Good Vibrations" - Really? - By The Beach Boys. - Why not? It's our last night here. Let's have a little party. Ophelia, turn it down. Turning down "Good Vibrations" - by The Beach Boys. - Would you chill out? All right? There's nobody out there. Just go back upstairs. I'll be up in a few minutes. Everything's gonna be fine. - What's going on? - Ugh. Uh, nothin'. - Nothing, guys. - Jesus. The backup generator went on, we're just trying to figure it out. Go back to sleep. Just because we're in our rooms doesn't mean we're sleeping. Fine. I don't know. Go back to your rooms. Guys, we have to be outta here at 10 a.m. tomorrow, sharp, so. ♪ Good vibrations ♪ Hello?

Why are they doing this? I'm sorry, but all of our operators are busy at the moment. Please hold and the next available operator... It's all just craziness. But all of our operators are busy at the moment. Please... How does 911 keep you on hold all night long? I just don't get it. Too many to answer. How many of everybody is there gonna be? The boardwalk was getting ready to close and a bunch of us had just gotten out and we were going to our cars when the attack happened. Oh, shit. Don't curse. And then we just saw red. - Wait, you saw red? - Yes, they were wearing red. They didn't look right. They had scissors and they were just walking up to people in the crowd and stabbing them! You said they were stabbing people? Yeah, it was chaos, and then we just started running. Where did they come from? What? I-I-I don't know. Someone said that they were coming from the sewers. The sewers? Okay, how many are... Sorry, I think they're coming. Uh, ma'am? Ma'am? Um... Okay, uh, so we certainly hope everything is okay there. It's too early to say what exactly is unfolding. But it does appear we are in the midst of a brutal and terrifying attack by people who are being described as wearing red, carrying scissors or shears and doing what can only be described as wreaking havoc on folks... And they look like us. They don't even know that yet. Okay, Chris, I'm gonna cut you off. But we have new images coming in here. Here, we see a man wearing red, who... Okay, this... This seems to be a group of individuals engaged in some sort of demonstration, protest... It's not clear at this time if or how these people are connected to the attacks. What is that? They're forming what looks like a human chain. What are they doing? I don't know but that would take a shitload of coordination. Obviously, if you have children watching this right now, to turn them away. Not sure what's about to happen. We have to go. What? You're joking, right? Zora, Jason, help your father. She's tripping. Where would we go? - The police, right? - No. We need to move and keep moving. We take the coast. We go to Mexico. Mexico? Okay. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! We got everything we need here. Food, water, backup generator. We're safe here as we're gonna be anywhere. Tell that to Josh and Kitty. They're right here. You're scaring the kids. - Too late. - Too late. They think like us. They know where we are. They won't stop until they kill us. Or we kill them. Then, let's make some traps or somethin', like some Home Alone type stuff. That way, if she comes... Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone. You know what I'm talkin' about. Gabe, they've been planning this. They have the upper hand. This is the time to run, not to be sprinkling Micro Machines on the floor. - What are Micro Machines? - What's Home Alone? We're not going anywhere. And that's final. You don't get to make the decisions anymore! So, does this mean we get their car? Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Who's got the keys? Get in the car, get in the car. - I'm driving. - No way. I told her, no. Dad's leg is messed up. You're handcuffed. It's not safe. I'm driving. - Zora! - No. I have the highest kill count in the family. You don't have the highest kill count. I killed both twins. Wrong. I just killed the second one. I killed Kitty. So that's one, one, one, and two. I killed two. I killed myself and Josh, so. It doesn't matter. - Zora, get in the back. - Look! Oh, shit, put the windows up, put the windows up, put the windows up! Okay, you're gonna want to back up. Buckle up. Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where is she? Did I get her? She's there! She's there! Jesus! Zora! Careful. You're going too fast! She's dead now, right? What are you doing? - Mom! - Where's she going? And she left. Your mom left the car. Whoa. Is that our car? It's followed who looks like me. Shit. Stay in the car. Lock the doors. What is she doing? It's a trap. Get out! Please. No. No! Jason! Jason? Jason! Jason! No! Adelaide! Here. What do we got here? Probably got bandages and stuff. Your mom knows what to do. Look. It's the line. Looks like some kind of fucked up performance art. Where is he? How it must have been to grow up with a sky. To feel the sun, the wind, the trees. But your people took it for granted. We're human too, you know. Lives. Gave them hands, blood. Exactly like you. And yet, it was humans that built this place. I believe they figured out how to make a copy of the body but not the soul. The soul remains one shared by two. They created the Tethered so they could use them to control the ones above. Like puppets. But they failed and they upended the Tethered. For generations, the Tethered continued without interactions. They all went mad down here. And then there was Addie. Put some meat on that one. Yeah, I guess I missed my chance to go pro. You remember? We were born special. I want number 11. Yeah? Addie, you wanna try it? God brought us together that night. I never stopped thinking about you. How things could have been. How you could have taken me with you. Years after we met, the miracle of life. That's when I saw God. And He showed me my path. You felt it, too. The end of our dance. The Tethered saw that I was different. That I would deliver them from this misery. I found my faith. And I began to prepare. It took years to plan. Everything had to be perfect. I didn't just need to kill you. I needed to make a statement that the whole world would see. It's our time now. Our time up there. And to think, if it weren't for you, I never would've danced at all. My baby! My baby! Oh, God. Look, look. They're all gone now. They can't hurt you. You understand? Everything's gonna be like it was before. She wasn't in 'Nam. Okay, she got lost. For 15 minutes, that's... That could be very scary. You don't know what happened to her. - Anything coulda happened to her. - Okay, okay. So, h-how? How do we get her to talk? Encourage her to draw, to write, to dance. Anything to help her tell us her story. I just want my little girl back. She left! I told you to look after her. Yeah. Yeah. - Look at you. - It's not my fault she left. Look at you. It's not my fault she... Look at me. Look at you.
