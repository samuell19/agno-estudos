JARED: May I help you? GRACE: Oh! Um, how much is that one? JARED: Oh! Brilliant choice. That one is twelve-thousand I believe. Would you like to see it? TESSA: Come on, grace! We haven't got all day. TESSA: Isn't he so deliciously gorgeous? GRACE: Tessa! TESSA: What?! Until he puts a ring on that finger, you gotta keep your options open. GRACE: Not Stewart. Today's fifteen months. TESSA: Are you serious? My record's a measly two. GRACE: Yeah, and get this... He says he has something special to tell me tonight over dinner! TESSA: Oooh, maybe he's gonna pop the question. You have to tell me all the juicy details... [MUSIC] GRACE: My parents love country livin'. Something about cleaner air... ...fewer people to contend with... ...and friendly neighbors who've always got your back. There's just one thing missing... NIGEL: Congratulations, Dr. Masters! You're going to love this place. CLINT: Yes sir, I believe I will. [MUSIC] GRACE: Mom, I'm home! KATHERINE: Hi! Have fun with Tess? GRACE: You would not believe the rock I saw today. A full carat. Princess cut. To die for! KATHERINE: Think Stewart can afford that and college? GRACE: Come help me pick my dress for tonight! KATHERINE: So what do you like about Stewart? GRACE: I don't know. He's really cute, and fun... And smart! He made the Dean's list last semester. KATHERINE: I knew a guy like that once. Grant ...Grant Williamson. The most handsome man I'd ever seen. GRACE: Really?! What happened? KATHERINE: One of the worst dates I ever had. All he could do was talk about himself. GRACE: Stewart's different. I know it's a long-distance relationship, but how much could somebody possibly change? KATHERINE: We all change. But true love is worth waiting for. GRACE: How 'bout this one? KATHERINE: Perfect. GRACE: Thanks mom! KATHERINE: I'd better get back to dinner. You mind telling your dad it'll be ready in about an hour? GRACE: Alright. JIM: That is pure gold. ROBERT: Dad, check this out! JIM: Pesky groundhogs. ROBERT: Don't worry, I'll take care of 'em. GRACE: Hi daddy! JIM: Hello Princess. GRACE: Mom's got dinner. How's it going? JIM: See for yourself. GRACE: Oh! Well, we could always move closer to Raleigh. Fewer pests... And a lot closer to Stewart. JIM: Grace, just look at this land... Our land. Been in the family for three generations, and you'd give all that up for some college jock? GRACE: Dad! I can't marry the farm. JIM: Well, you'd be surprised what you can learn about love from a soybean. GRACE: I've gotta get ready for my date. Can we talk about this later? JIM: I'll have to walk her down the aisle one day. But he better be a really good man. KATHERINE: Drew, time to eat! DREW: Coming! Please, oh, please be Mac 'n' cheese! Ewhck! KATHERINE: And what's wrong with Brussels sprouts, may I ask? DREW: They're stinky and squishy and... KATHERINE: Tasty! Now not another word or you're gonna get a second helping. DREW: Yes ma'am. [MUSIC] JIM: Sorry I'm late. KATHERINE: That's okay. JIM: But if we hope to cover the mortgage, this harvest is critical. KATHERINE: I know. I kept it warm for ya. JIM: Guess I'd better wash up then. [MUSIC] DREW: Daddy! JIM: Been good for your momma? DREW: Yep! Look what I carved! JIM: Thatta boy. He's looking good! [MUSIC] Where's grace? KATHERINE: Stewart's picking her up at seven. JIM: Why can't he just come over here and eat with us? KATHERINE: And would you have wanted to do that when we were dating? JIM: She's getting too emotionally attached. We can talk about this later. KATHERINE: You look lovely. JIM: Remember what I told you. GRACE: Dad, it's Stewart. Don't worry, if he tries to touch me I'll just punch him in the nose. GRACE: Where is he? [PHONE RINGING] DREW: I got it! Hello? Grace who? GRACE: Drew, give me the phone! Stewart... Where are you?! What? Yeah, I'll meet you there. JIM: Something the matter? GRACE: No, he just wants me to meet him at the diner. JIM: Now let's pray! [MUSIC] STEWART: Hey, grace! Over here! STEWART: You remember Jake, dontchya? GRACE: Hi. I thought "we" had a date... STEWART: Oh them? They're just college buds, they won't be in town long. Ronnie! You made it! RONALD: Whatzzup Stu! STEWART: Whatzzup baby? RONALD: Hey guys!! CHEERLEADER: Ronnie! RONALD: Good to see ya, you're looking great... Oh, French fries! WAITRESS: What can I get for you? GRACE: Um, I'll have a burger, fries and a soda. RONALD: Same please. Waitress okay. STEWART: So good to see you. RONALD: Good to see you too buddy! STEWART: Alright, let's get it on... Rematch! Let's go... Right now. RONALD: Come on! STEWART: Let's go. CHEERLEADER: What is this? RONALD: Fine! JAKE: Tradition. STEWART: One... Two... Three! JAKE: Weaksauce. He's got you... RONALD: You cheated. It's the beard. JAKE: Some things never change. STEWART: Alright, here you go. You ready for this? RONALD: Oh I got you on this one. Ha! Top that. Alright, one last one. Here we go. GRACE: Stewart! We need to talk! I thought you had something special you wanted to tell me. STEWART: I do. Listen up everyone! STEWART: We're engaged. RONALD: Congratulations! That's awesome! STEWART: Yeah, we're pretty stoked. JAKE: When's the date? STEWART: We'll figure it out. [MUSIC] DREW: Armed and ready, over! JIM: Grace? KATHERINE: Grace? GRACE: You were right. JIM: What happened? GRACE: I felt like a third wheel on my own date, and I watched him with his ring on another girl's finger. KATHERINE: Oh honey, I'm so sorry. GRACE: Why does this keep happening to me? First Bryce, then Stewart. All the guys around here are total jerks!! GRACE: I shoulda seen it coming. He was checking out other girls on our last date. JIM: It sounds like the lord kept you from a big disaster. GRACE: I'm beginning to think he doesn't even want me to get married. KATHERINE: Whenever I used to get discouraged, my momma used to say, "Katherine, hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when the desire comes it's a tree of life." She was right, you know. GRACE: Thanks mom. KATHERINE: Besides, the night's not a total loss. Why don't we all play a game? GRACE: Do I have to? KATHERINE: Come on, it'll be fun. GRACE: Okay, I'll go change. [MUSIC] DREW: All clear. [MUSIC] My turn. Yes! "I'm Stewart and I'm losing at the game of life." ROBERT: Drew, cut it out! JIM: Ah, more delicious cookies? Thank you! KATHERINE: You're welcome. GRACE: "Twin sons are born. Collect presents." DREW: All you girls think about is getting married and having kids. JIM: Marriage is a gift from god, son. DREW: I don't want to get married. JIM: Remind me of that in a decade, okay? ROBERT: Dad, do you think there's just one perfect person out there that we're supposed to find and marry? JIM: That's a good question, Robert. I think it's not so much about finding the perfect person as it is becoming the person god meant you to be. Mmm, my turn. KATHERINE: Thought you could use a little break. JIM: Thanks, dear. Just leave it on the desk. [MUSIC] KATHERINE: "Trustworthiness, "a willingness to lead his family, an understanding of his wife's needs"... Sounds like a good book. JIM: Convicting's more like it. Pastor highly recommended it. Speaking of pastors... You know at weddings when he asks, "who gives this woman to be married?"... Ever wondered where that came from? KATHERINE: Hadn't really thought about it. JIM: Jeremiah 29:6. "Fathers give their daughters in marriage." KATHERINE: So what are you saying? JIM: Who am I going to give our daughter to? Most young men today have no clue what it means to be a man. KATHERINE: They're out there. I should know. Duty calls. [MUSIC] JIM: Andrew miles Anderson! I want to see you in my study young man. DREW: Uh-oh! ROBERT: What'd ya do now? JIM: Have a seat. JIM: Son, did you write this? "Pretty girl, makes great Mac and cheese, we need a good man to come and get her." DREW: She does make the best Mac 'n' cheese. JIM: Son, there's more to relationships than food! DREW: But dad, Kenny said, "the way to a man's heart is through his stomach." [DOORBELL RINGING] JIM: Wait here! We'll deal with this later. FOODIE FRED: Hi! Is it here? I mean, is she here? I mean... I'm here about the macaroni and cheese, and the girl that needs taken away. Unless of course she's already been taken, in which case, hey, I'll just take the macaroni and cheese. JIM: I'm sorry, there's been a big mistake. [MUSIC] [DOORBELL RINGING] UNKEPT MUSICIAN: Susannah, run away, you really took my heart away, you really found me in my dreams... COOL GUY: Your daughter, she might need these when she catches a glimpse of me, okay. Technically, I already have a girlfriend, just doing a little comparative shopping, weighing my options, always looking for that ...Upgrade. GRANT: I never thought I'd be the man knocking on your door, asking to meet your daughter that I've never met. But you know what? It takes a lot of humility in a relationship, and that's what I'm all about... Putting her first. COMPUTER NERD: I wanted to ask you a few questions about your daughter. Is she pretty clean? Tidy? Organized? Neat? Clutter... I can't do clutter... Clutter's not okay, hoarding's not okay either, unless she hoards comic books. GRANT: Granted, I won't be there all the time, I'll be out making the money. Now granted she'll have to do some of that too. JIM: No, no, there's been a mistake. GRANT: Now granted I don't even have a job, but that's something I can work on... heh, work on. STEVE: I can do business, advertising, sales, marketing, tennis... Best Frisbee golfer you will ever see! GRANT: Now granted these are just a few of my thoughts, granted we'll probably need to talk more about this, perhaps on our first date. Granted she'll probably have to buy her first date. But there's one thing I want you to know sir, I will never take your daughter for granted! JIM: Goodbye! BROOKE: Yes, hi, I was looking for information on a recent graduate ...Clint masters? BROOKE: Do you know where... East bend family clinic... Great, thank you... Yes, thanks. [MUSIC] GRACE: Guess who? TESSA: Farmer girl. GRACE: Uh! How'd you even know it was me?! TESSA: Your perfume. It stinks. GRACE: Thanks a lot! Can't even get any love from my best friend. TESSA: Relax. Just get a new brand. Smell this. The guys love it. GRACE: Any more Sage advice? TESSA: Since you mentioned it, if you're ever gonna nab a hot guy, you need to get a new wardrobe. Stop dressing like your mom. GRACE: I need a latte. Want anything? TESSA: Nah, I gotta run. Hope you don't mind. GRACE: Do I have a choice? TESSA: Your bad luck can't last forever. I'm sure the perfect guy is like right around the corner. GRACE: Yeah right. JARED: Hello, how can I help you? GRACE: Double latte, extra cream. JARED: Have we... Have we met before? GRACE: Please, I just need a coffee. JARED: Alright. There ya go. Rings! You were after the big one. I'm Jared. GRACE: Thank you for reminding me of the most horrible day of my life! JARED: Ooookay... Cover for me. Got dumped, huh? GRACE: Will you please stop following me? JARED: Take it easy. We're practically old friends. GRACE: Okay Jared, since we're supposed to know each other so well, perhaps you can fill me in on a few minor details. JARED: Okay. Whaddya wanna know? GRACE: For starters, how'd you got from the jewelry store to here? JARED: Okay, I drove. Okay, okay! Look, I just didn't like dressing up, wearing a tie. Plus, this is just more my style. GRACE: Much more romantic then helping couples pick out their rings. JARED: Maybe. But I've stood behind that counter and watched people fall in love over coffee. It can happen anywhere, anytime. And... maybe even to us. GRACE: But you hardly even know me. JARED: That's something I'd like to change. [MUSIC] Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen, would you think it too forward if I called you? GRACE: So many firsts. [MUSIC] JARED: Thank you. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] JIM: Morning, ladies. Whatchya working on? GRACE: It's a project for my interior design course. It counts for half my grade. JIM: Whaddya ya say, when you're finished with that, we go welcome the new neighbor? GRACE: The bates farm? JIM: Thought we'd all give 'em a warm Carolina greeting. KATHERINE: I could bake a pie. GRACE: I'll help you! JIM: You always think of the perfect touch. KATHERINE: Oh hush. JIM: Jim Anderson. CLINT: Clint masters. JIM: Good to meet you Clint. This is my wife, Katherine, and the rest of our family here. CLINT: Oh! Hmmm, this is my favorite. Thank you so much. Make yourselves comfortable. Can I get you anything to drink? JIM: No, we can't stay long. [MUSIC] KATHERINE: You've made quite a few changes to the place. CLINT: I hope they're all good changes, ma'am. KATHERINE: Yes, I didn't mean to imply that they weren't. You see, Judy... Mrs. Bates... And I were very close. We shared many happy afternoons here. CLINT: I see. Perhaps you can advise me if I've overlooked anything. KATHERINE: You get rid of that old stove? CLINT: Not yet. KATHERINE: It burnt some of my best scones. ROBERT: Yeah, but they made good target practice. GRACE: That picture there. Who is that? CLINT: Dad was a champion rodeo rider in his day. DREW: See, I told you this guy would be cool. GRACE: So why east bend? CLINT: Well, after finishing med school at wake, a spot opened up at the clinic, so, here I am. ROBERT: So you're a doctor? CLINT: Yes. Hope to have my own family practice someday. KATHERINE: Pardon my saying so, but you look so young to be practicing medicine. CLINT: I guess school hasn't taken it's toll then. Believe it or not, I'm 28. JIM: I admire your dedication. Your parents must be very proud. CLINT: Thank you, sir. JIM: Don't know if you've had time to find a good church home yet, but you're more than welcome to join us. CLINT: Appreciate the invitation. I'd love to. JIM: Great! GRACE: Have a sec? JIM: Sure, what's up? GRACE: I met a guy at the coffee shop the other day. Actually, we met before but that's a long story. Anyway, his name is Jared. At first he kinda teased me, but then he was really nice and helped me out. JIM: I bet he did. I want to meet this guy before you go out with him. GRACE: Don't you trust me? JIM: I don't trust him! Actually, your mother and I have been concerned about you. GRACE: I'm not a child anymore. JIM: I've been doing some reading. You might be interested to hear... [DOORBELL RINGING] GRACE: I'll get it. JIM: Sweetheart, wait! [MUSIC] BIKER: I'm here about the ad for a pretty girl who can cook? GRACE: There must be some sort of mistake... Wait a minute... Let me see that... [MUSIC] Drew! Just wait till I get my hands on you!! [MUSIC] KATHERINE: May I help you? BIKER: Ah, you must be the one from the ad. I bet you could cook just about anything, buttercup. How are you around bikes? KATHERINE: I'm sorry, but that ad is closed. [MUSIC] JIM: Who was it this time? KATHERINE: You don't even wanna know. JIM: Where's grace? We were having a nice little conversation. KATHERINE: Oh, she's chasing after drew. JIM: That might take a while! I'll be in the barn. KATHERINE: That boy, that boy, that boy... NIGEL: Having any success? NIGEL: Nigel Livengood, east bend realty. JIM: Something I can do for you? NIGEL: I sold a home in this area and saw this fine piece of land you've got here. JIM: It's not for sale. NIGEL: Well, I'm sure you have some sentimental reason to hang on to it, but I'm prepared to pay... Handsomely. JIM: No thanks. NIGEL: Oh, that's too bad. According to my sources, there's a notice of pending default against the property. JIM: If you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. [MUSIC] NIGEL: Standing offer. JIM: Get off my land. [MUSIC] [DOORBELL] JARED: Uh, hey! GRACE: Jared! What are you doing here? JARED: Where you expecting someone else? GRACE: No, no, I, uh... How'd you find me? JARED: Ever heard of the Internet? GRACE: I thought you were gonna call me. JARED: Thought I'd see you in person instead. GRACE: My dad wanted to meet you anyway, so, come on in. JARED: Okay. GRACE: Dad, this is Jared, the guy I was telling you about earlier? JIM: Hello, Jared. JARED: Hello. Pleasure. JIM: This is my wife Katherine. JARED: Oh, hi Katherine! JIM: If you have a minute, why don't we sit down and talk? JARED: I'd love to, but I was just on my way to get a shake, and stopped by to see if grace wanted to come? If it's alright? JIM: Don't be out late. JARED: Yes, sir. [MUSIC] I really like your family. GRACE: They're all right. Tell me about yours. JARED: There's not much to tell. Dad left home when I was four so I really don't know him that well. GRACE: Sorry to hear that. JARED: And my mom, it was really hard for her to make ends meet, so I left home too when I was 17. GRACE: Wow, sounds tough. JARED: Eh, I kinda like the freedom. GRACE: You ever plan on settling down? JARED: Um, maybe. If I find the right girl. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] GRACE: This your place? JARED: Yeah, I promise it looks a little better on the inside. GRACE: Ugh! Just look at my hair, it's a mess! JARED: I am. GRACE: Wait! JARED: What? GRACE: Not till you put a ring on it. Princess cut. JARED: You take this commitment stuff pretty serious, don't ya? GRACE: Of course. Don't you? JARED: Why don't you come in, get dried off, and I'll take you home? GRACE: I can't. I shouldn't. JARED: We wouldn't be alone, if that's what's worrying ya. My roommate's always in there playing video games. GRACE: I don't know... JARED: Tell you what, why don't I go check and see. [CAR DOOR SLAMS] [PHONE RINGING] JIM: Maybe grace was right. KATHERINE: Care to fill me in? I know things are tough, but we'll make it through. JIM: Couple weeks ago a guy made an offer on the farm. It was enough to get us out of debt... And then some. KATHERINE: It's been in your family for so long... JIM: I just want what's best for the kids, you know? JIM: If only I could get that combine working! [PHONE RINGING] GRACE: This is grace, leave a message! KATHERINE: It's not like her not to answer the phone. JIM: Her battery's probably dead. KATHERINE: I can't put my finger on it, but something's been bothering me about Jared. JIM: Okay. Well, why don't we have him over for dinner? That way we can all get to know him better. KATHERINE: I'd like that. This better be grace! Look at you! You trying to catch a cold? Honey, grab some towels. GRACE: Mom, I'm fine, really. KATHERINE: What happened? Where've you been? GRACE: Nothing! We just got caught in the rain, that's all. KATHERINE: I'm glad you're okay. GRACE: I'm fine! Now please excuse me, while I get cleaned up. [FOOTSTEPS] [DIALING] [RINGING] TESSA: Hey, what's up, how'd it go? GRACE: For the first time in my life, I'm not sure what to do. TESSA: Why? Did he force himself on you? GRACE: No, not exactly. He kissed me. TESSA: And you're complaining about that? I've kissed tons of guys, it's not a big deal. GRACE: Then why doesn't it feel right? My stomach's all a whirl. TESSA: You mean it wasn't what you wanted? GRACE: I know it wasn't what my parents wanted. TESSA: Stop worrying about them. You can't be tied to them forever. GRACE: But now every time we're together he wants to go somewhere secluded! TESSA: And what's wrong with that? GRACE: I'd feel better telling my parents I had a great time if I didn't have to leave out parts of the story. TESSA: Listen, you care about him, right? GRACE: Yeah... I think so. TESSA: Then stop making such a big deal over a simple little kiss! It's totally unrealistic, right? Come on grace. GRACE: Maybe it's just me. TESSA: Hey, I know! Why don't you call my mom's therapist? GRACE: Your mom has a therapist? TESSA: Yeah, doesn't everybody? GRACE: I don't know, I just think that... TESSA: Aw come on, what do you got to lose? The first session's free. [MUSIC] GRACE: Okay. TESSA: Have a good night, okay? [MUSIC] [KNOCKING] MRS. LUDLOW: Come in! GRACE: Mrs. Ludlow? MRS. LUDLOW: Grace, darling, come in, come in! GRACE: I hope I'm not too early. MRS. LUDLOW: Oh no, no, not at all. Come in. Come in. Please make yourself comfortable, have a seat. MRS. LUDLOW: What's troubling you, dear? GRACE: I'm seeing this guy that I care about, but I'm not sure why I don't feel right about our relationship. I like being with him, I just feel inhibited somehow. MRS. LUDLOW: In what way? GRACE: I don't know... It's just that, every time we're together he wants to be physical. You know... hug, and kiss, and stuff like that. It makes me uncomfortable. MRS. LUDLOW: Any past relationships? GRACE: Too many. I feel like my heart's been passed around like a football. Which is one thing I really love about Jared, he says the sweetest things. He makes me feel... Wanted. But when he starts touching me, I feel... Guilty. MRS. LUDLOW: Grace, what I'm hearing is a woman in search of identity. MRS. LUDLOW: But identity is irrational, a tension between your conscious and subconscious mind. In order to remove your guilt, you have to feel free to construct yourself within a new framework. MRS. LUDLOW: In other words, perhaps your inhibitions are telling you that it's time to try a starter marriage. GRACE: A what? MRS. LUDLOW: A starter marriage, a "trial run" of sorts. You know, it's a place where you begin, but it's not where you hope to end up. GRACE: I'm not sure I'm following you. MRS. LUDLOW: You do want to get married, don't you? GRACE: Yes, but... MRS. LUDLOW: Then you must facilitate the breaking down of barriers. GRACE: Are you suggesting that in order to overcome my inhibitions I should first live with this guy without being married? MRS. LUDLOW: Well, I wouldn't have put it in those words, but this does commence the process of reconstruction. GRACE: But that wouldn't be right! MRS. LUDLOW: Well, how will you know the shoe fits until you try it on? GRACE: I'm sorry, Mrs. Ludlow, but I think I've wasted your time. MRS. LUDLOW: Are you sure, darling? GRACE: Would you please excuse me? MRS. LUDLOW: You've still have time left in your free session? GRACE: Gotta run... Bye Mrs. Ludlow! MRS. LUDLOW: Think on what I've said, darling. MRS. LUDLOW: Hmph! What an odd little girl. GRACE: Perfect. DREW: Good! GRACE: Drew! DREW: Sorry. GRACE: Drew, look what you just did! DREW: Sorry!! KATHERINE: What is going on here? GRACE: What am I gonna do? This is my final project, and it's due tomorrow! KATHERINE: We'll figure something out. GRACE: Sometimes I wish you weren't even my brother. Just go away and leave me alone! KATHERINE: Grace! [MUSIC] GRACE: Drew, wait, come back! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. CLINT: Well, I appreciate your willingness to help. JIM: Sure, anytime. Have a good one. CLINT: You too. [CAR STARTING] [SCREAMING] [MUSIC] CLINT: Grace, you okay!? GRACE: It's drew! FRANK: I didn't see him. [MUSIC] CLINT: What happened? Drew, you alright buddy?? DREW: I... I fell off my bike. CLINT: You okay? FRANK: Is he alright? CLINT: Does it hurt? Are you hurt anywhere!? DREW: No... CLINT: Look at me. GRACE: I'm sorry! CLINT: Hey... It's gonna be okay. [MUSIC] CLINT: Let me see your arm,. Does it hurt when I touch here? Can you move your fingers? Yeah? [MUSIC] No pain down here...? DREW: No... JIM: Is he okay? CLINT: Yeah, he seems fine. JIM: Praise god! CLINT: Looks like the bike took the worst of it, and drew here just took a tumble. Tell you what, you want to try to stand up buddy? You okay to do that? [MUSIC] You gave us a scare there man. JIM: Thank you Clint. CLINT: I'll come by and check on you later, okay? JIM: I'd appreciate that. KATHERINE: Grace, is that you? GRACE: I'm gonna go lay down. KATHERINE: Are you and drew okay? GRACE: He'll be fine! [FOOTSTEPS] [CRYING] KATHERINE: Grace? Are you okay?! GRACE: I'm fine... KATHERINE: You know I'm always here for you if you wanna talk. GRACE: Oh, mom! Everything's a mess! GRACE: I've been so foolish, trying to handle things on my own. GRACE: I knew that if I stuck around after my dates with Jared that you'd ask all about it. KATHERINE: Grace... GRACE: I hate this, I just hate it! KATHERINE: I love you, and nothing you've done will ever change that. [MUSIC] GRACE: That night it rained, Jared wanted to show me his place. And he started stroking my hair, and he kissed me... And he wouldn't stop. I was so confused, I felt trapped... And Tessa recommended I talk to her mom's therapist, and she said I need a starter marriage. KATHERINE: Oh honey! [MUSIC] GRACE: Why does love have to be so complicated? [MUSIC] KATHERINE: I think your father may have some answers. [MUSIC] Jim! Grace has something she wants to share with you, and we can use your wisdom. GRACE: Daddy... I haven't been honest with you and mom about my dates with Jared. He's pushed our relationship to be much more physical than I know is right. I'm sorry for hiding it from you both. Can you forgive me? JIM: Of course we forgive you, honey. Thank you for being honest with us. Have you shared any of this with Jared? GRACE: I tried but he doesn't want to hear it. JIM: Grace, your mother and I want to protect you from having your heart broken again, from having any more regrets. GRACE: Me too. But how? JIM: I think the answer's been right in front of us all along. GRACE: Soybeans? JIM: As the head of this house it's my responsibility to help prepare you for marriage and to protect you until that day arrives. Honey, I've been so busy with this farm that I've failed to do that. Can you forgive me for being so insensitive to your needs, your hopes and dreams for the future? GRACE: Oh daddy! I do, I do! [MUSIC] I'm still not quite sure how this is going to help. JIM: Open it. [MUSIC] GRACE: And this is gonna help me find a man... how? JIM: You're trying to get a harvest before you've planted the seed. God has given you this valuable time to serve others and draw closer to him. Use it wisely! KATHERINE: And to work on your relationship with your brothers. JIM: Stop trying to find love, and let god bring love to you. GRACE: Dad, you're not talking about an arranged marriage, are you? JIM: No, Princess, who you marry is a decision you're going to have to make yourself. But I'm here to help you, to guide you, if you'll trust me. [MUSIC] GRACE: I'm still not sure what all this means, but I'm ready to give it a try. JIM: It thrills my heart to hear you say that. [MUSIC] GRACE: So what should I do about Jared? JIM: I think you already know. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] JARED: Grace! Grace wait up! Whoa, whoa! GRACE: Oh, hi Jared. JARED: I've been trying to call you for days. Why haven't you been answering? GRACE: We've been really busy. JARED: Hey, uh, you wanna go to our spot? You can tell me what it was you wanted to talk about. GRACE: No, actually, I prefer to tell you here. JARED: Okay. What's up? GRACE: I've finally figured out what's been bothering me about our relationship. JARED: Oh? Uh, what's that? GRACE: Jared, you and I aren't right together. I just... I think it'd be best if we stop seeing each other. JARED: You're kidding, right. Why? GRACE: I just..I want to have a clear conscience before the lord and my parents, and I don't. And I don't want to be in an intimate relationship until I'm married. I want my life to start going in a different direction. JARED: Good luck with that. [MUSIC] GRACE: I hope you can respect my wishes and just... Don't call or come by anymore. JARED: Fine, if that's what you want. I can play this charade. GRACE: Please, don't misunderstand me. I'm through playing games. I just want real, lasting love. JARED: And I thought that's what we had! GRACE: I'm sorry, Jared! [CAR STARTING] [MUSIC] Got my work cut out for me, don't I? DREW: Grace. I'm sorry I messed up your project. Forgive me? GRACE: Of course. I'm sorry for reacting the way I did. Come here! I love you little brother. [KISS] DREW: Aww, come on! [MUSIC] [MUSIC] KATHERINE: Sweet dreams. [MUSIC] CLINT: Oh! I'm sorry. You all right? TESSA: Yeah. I'm fine. CLINT: You sure? TESSA: Yeah. CLINT: Sorry about that. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] Hey grace. Grace? Hi! GRACE: Hi! I'm sorry, I didn't know I had company. CLINT: Oh, that's fine. I actually came to see drew. He doing okay? GRACE: Yep. Full of energy. CLINT: Good. GRACE: Thank you for what you did the other day. I was really scared. CLINT: Of course. Just glad I could be there. GRACE: If you're looking for drew he might be down at the barn. CLINT: Right... Thanks. [MUSIC] JIM: Well boys, thanks to your hard work and god's blessing, we've got us a banner crop. Only one small problem: I can't get the combine working and the parts are on backorder. So, we're gonna have to do this the old fashioned way... JIM: ...By hand. ROBERT: Dad, that's insane. JIM: I know, I know, but, uh, I've got creditors breathing down my neck. DREW: Isn't there some other way? JIM: I wish there was. Tell you what: You boys help me get this crop in, and we'll celebrate by throwing a trapshooting competition. ROBERT: Hmm, hard to pass that one up... All right, I'm in. JIM: That's the spirit! DREW: But dad, there's only three of us! JIM: Don't worry about it son, I know where to find reinforcements. [MUSIC] JIM: Ever worked soybeans before? CLINT: No sir, not yet. JIM: How are ya? CLINT: How ya feeling buddy? DREW: Good. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] CLINT: Thank you for being willing to talk to me, I appreciate it. JIM: What's on your mind? It's about your daughter. Not exactly sure how to go about this, but I want to be clear with my intentions up front. I'm seeking your approval to pursue a relationship with grace. I'd like to get to know her better, and explore the possibility of marriage. [MUSIC] JIM: Clint, we uh, we appreciate you coming to us first about this. Marriage is a serious matter. You've impressed me as a man of integrity. And I believe you would do things in a way that would be honorable to both grace and to god. So let's take this step by step, as god continues to direct our path. JIM: Katherine and I, well, we're willing to see what god has in store for both of you. [MUSIC] As her father, I promised grace that I would watch over her, that I would protect her, that I would be a part of this journey. She's my daughter, Clint. [MUSIC] CLINT: I understand. JIM: You're a good man, Clint. CLINT: Thank you sir. Thank you both! [MUSIC] CLINT: May I? GRACE: So peaceful. CLINT: It is. Look... Grace, I have something important I want to ask you. I've really enjoyed getting to know your family over the last few months... And getting to know you. I'd like to get to know you better. Would you consider exploring a deeper friendship with me? I mean, a relationship in which we'd both be prayerfully considering the possibility... Of marriage? GRACE: Clint, if you had asked me just a couple weeks ago I would have said yes in a heartbeat... But I'm determined not to go through this without my dad's blessing. CLINT: He said, "yes." GRACE: So I... Wait, what? CLINT: I already spoke with your parents. They gave us their blessing to proceed under their guidance. GRACE: Drew put you up to this, didn't he? CLINT: Grace, this isn't a joke. I think you're amazing. Your heart's too precious a treasure to play games with. [MUSIC] I got you something. GRACE: They're beautiful. CLINT: The Iris symbolizes Jesus and how we need to build our identity around him to be truly satisfied. CLINT: And the roses represent the need for purity in our relationship. Grace, I want to treat you with the honor and respect that you're due, so that even if the lord doesn't bring us together in marriage, we can remain friends. GRACE: I'd be honored to explore that possibility with you. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] CLINT: Spin... Go for the magic number... Yes! ROBERT: No way! CLINT: 1... 2... 3... 4... Retire in style. Who's the winner at life? This guy! GRACE: Okay, come on! ROBERT: I'd like to see you really try. CLINT: That's okay. I won. Game over. [DOORBELL] All of this... Mine. [MUSIC] TESSA: You double crosser. GRACE: Whoa, wait! [DOOR SLAMS] What are you talking about? TESSA: I thought you were waiting on god. GRACE: I am. TESSA: So then what are you doing with my guy? GRACE: Who? TESSA: The guy from the coffee shop, who else? GRACE: Clint? Okay, wow. I know what you're thinking. Honestly, I didn't know that he was 'that guy.' TESSA: So then prove it. Break up with him. Break up with him or I'll... I will never speak to you again! GRACE: Tessa, that's not fair! Just calm down and let me explain. Clint and I are just friends, and we're explore... TESSA: Call it what you want, you stole my guy. So what's it gonna be? GRACE: I'm sorry, I can't do that. Just come inside and let's talk about it. TESSA: So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Some friend you are. GRACE: Tessa! [CAR DOOR SLAMS] BROOKE: Oh, hey, excuse me. Ma'am? MRS. LUDLOW: Yes, can I help you, dear? BROOKE: Yes, hi, I was wondering... I'm looking for a friend of mine... Clint masters. Do you know him? MRS. LUDLOW: Isn't that the new doctor in east bend? BROOKE: East bend, you say? MRS. LUDLOW: Yes, down that way, not far. If you go down to the first turn, and you'll take a left, there at the old Hirschman place, you know, and then a few miles on down you'll see the church and you'll know you're close that way. Don't blink or you'll Miss it. BROOKE: Thanks. MRS. LUDLOW: I hear he's renovating the old bates farm. You plan to be around long? BROOKE: Not if I can help it. Bye! KATHERINE: She thought Clint was hers? GRACE: I tried to explain that Clint wasn't mine either, but she wouldn't hear me out. KATHERINE: We all have our blind side. GRACE: Another friendship bites the dust. KATHERINE: Don't give up on her. Maybe in time she'll come around. [PHONE RINGING] Mmm! Sweet smell of success. GRACE: And I know why. KATHERINE: Shh, don't give away our family secrets! [DOORBELL] GRACE: I wonder who that is? Looking for someone? BROOKE: Clint masters? I believe he bought some property around here. GRACE: Oh, are you related? BROOKE: No. Not yet, anyway. KATHERINE: He lives the next farm over. Grace can show you if you'd like. BROOKE: That's okay, I can manage, thanks. KATHERINE: Wait, there he is now. Any luck finding a combine? JIM: Another dead end. KATHERINE: This young lady's looking for Clint. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name... CLINT: Brooke?? BROOKE: Hello stranger. CLINT: What are you doing here? BROOKE: Well, I... I could ask you the same thing. CLINT: I see some of you have already met. Mr. Anderson, this is Brooke, a friend of mine from back home. JIM: Nice to meet you. Any friend of Clint's is a friend of ours. BROOKE: I was hoping you could recommend a place to stay. Is there anything close by? KATHERINE: You must be very tired. You can stay with us. BROOKE: Oh, no, that's okay. I... I don't want to impose... JIM: It's not a problem. Do you have some luggage? BROOKE: Sure, thanks. JIM: Robert, why don't you help her with the luggage. ROBERT: Can I have your keys real quick? Thank you. [MUSIC] CLINT: Um, guess I'll help with the luggage. [MUSIC] GRACE: So, where are you from? BROOKE: Colorado. GRACE: I've heard that's a beautiful state. BROOKE: Yeah, it is. GRACE: How do you know Clint? BROOKE: Oh, uh, we grew up together and dated all through college. GRACE: Really? BROOKE: Mhm. Then his parents wanted him to go off to med school and that was it... He practically just disappeared. GRACE: I knew someone that went away to college and came back a completely different person. BROOKE: Yeah? Well we're both grown up now. And him a doctor too! I can't wait to catch up. So... how is it that you know Clint? GRACE: Uhhh... KATHERINE: Grace, can you please give me a hand in the kitchen? GRACE: Be right there. BROOKE: Wouldn't a restaurant be easier? GRACE: Welcome to east bend. [FOOTSTEPS] [ROOSTER CROWING] CLINT: That's a lot of beans! JIM: God gave me two hands, and I intend to use 'em. Not gonna let a broken combine slow me down! CLINT: My father says, "duties are ours and results are god's." JIM: Your father's a wise man. JIM: So you and Robert will start over here, I'll work up the middle and the women can start over here. CLINT: How long do you think it'll take? JIM: If the weather holds, and we work fast, two weeks, maybe three. CLINT: Sounds like a workable plan. JIM: Great! Now tell me about Brooke. CLINT: Mr. Anderson, Brooke and I used to be in a relationship. CLINT: Everyone expected us to get married. I even had the ring. It just wasn't right though. Neither one of us had our priorities straight. My parents encouraged me to just be patient and wait on god's timing. So I broke it off with her and I buried the ring. JIM: Yet here she is. [MUSIC] CLINT: I'm really sorry. I didn't want grace to get a surprise like this. [MUSIC] JIM: I believe you Clint. CLINT: Thank you. JIM: But I will not have grace getting hurt. So I'm counting on god to show you how to handle this. CLINT: Yes sir. JIM: Good. [LAUGHING] Let's pray. Lord, thank you for your Providence which has brought Brooke and Clint to our table tonight. May all of these young people seated here look to your word for guidance and direction in their life. We ask your blessing for this food now and for those that have prepared it. In Jesus' name we praise you, amen. BROOKE: Clint, you remember we used to make cornbread growing up? CLINT: I do. [CHATTER] KATHERINE: Cornbread? Your favorite. JIM: Ah, looks great. Yeah, I think I'll have some cornbread. CLINT: This looks delicious. JIM: Who made the cornbread? KATHERINE: Grace. GRACE: I helped out! KATHERINE: She's a very fine cook. JIM: She is a fine cook. CLINT: She's got a great teacher. KATHERINE: We teach them well. JIM: Lock that front window over there. Were you guys playing in the yard today or this afternoon. BROOKE: So Clint, how do you like being a doctor? CLINT: I like it. BROOKE: How's that going? CLINT: It's going great. I'm liking it here in east bend. BROOKE: That's wonderful! GRACE: We're happy to have you. JIM: Quiet here. Hard-working people. ROBERT: So what brings you to north Carolina? BROOKE: Oh... Looking for something I lost. JIM: Well gang, I'm happy to announce that the crop is ready. And Clint has agreed to take the week off to help with the harvest. GRACE: That's very kind of you, doctor. JIM: And as an added incentive, if we get it in on time, I would like to host a harvest festival. DREW: Yes! BROOKE: What is a harvest festival? KATHERINE: We invite the community to come and share a bountiful feast with us in celebration of our harvest. BROOKE: Oh! So you give it all away? JIM: Not all of it. But if god has blessed us with so much, we should use it to bless others. BROOKE: What a strange idea. [PHONE RINGING] CLINT: I'm sorry to have to do this, but I really should get going. Thank you so much for dinner, that was fantastic. BROOKE: Um... CLINT: Yeah, well, I know it's not a sports car, but I have complete confidence in you. Thanks, Mike, I really appreciate this. Alright, talk to you soon. BROOKE: Clint! [Footsteps you leaving so soon? I thought we could catch up? CLINT: Brooke... Things have changed. I've changed. BROOKE: Yeah? I've changed too. But I still Miss you. CLINT: I need you to understand. I'm beginning a new relationship. I'm trying to do things the right way. BROOKE: The right way? Am I the wrong way? CLINT: That's not what I meant. I'm sorry... I need to go. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] JIM: How you ladies faring over there? GRACE: We'll make it. KATHERINE: I'll get the hang of it by the time we're done. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] DREW: Hey dad! Look! [MUSIC] JIM: Would you look at that. [MUSIC] ROBERT: Sweet! [MUSIC] DREW: Yippee!! [MUSIC] DREW: Clint! Clint! Clint! [MUSIC] JIM: How'd you get it running? CLINT: My buddy Mike works wonders with engines, so I asked him to give it a shot. CLINT: All yours. JIM: Looks like we're gonna have an early harvest festival! [MUSIC] [HORN HONKING] [CHEERING] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] TESSA: I know you probably weren't expecting to see me here, but... I blew things out of proportion the other night with Clint. I'm sorry. GRACE: Seems this misunderstanding was my fault too. Forgive me? TESSA: Of course. Clint just better have a brother. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] BIKER: Let me tell you about my hog. You're gonna like this. Here it is... [MUSIC] JIM: Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention? Thank you. Thank you so much for coming to our harvest celebration. Katherine and I, we really hope you have a great time today. And for anyone who's interested, if you'll start making your way over to the sporting clays area we'll start that trapshooting competition in just a few minutes. [CROWD] ROBERT: Come on, sis, you don't want to Miss my expert shooting, do ya? GRACE: I can't. I need to stay here and help out. MADISON: Go on, I can handle this. GRACE: Are you sure? MADISON: Oh yeah. GRACE: Okay. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] ROBERT: Pull! [MUSIC] LEVI: Pull! [MUSIC] CLINT: Pull! [MUSIC] GRACE: Pull! [MUSIC] CLINT: How'd you learn to shoot like that? GRACE: I guess living in the country has its perks. [MUSIC] BROOKE: Pull! [MUSIC] BROOKE: Clint? Clint! Can you help me? My gun is jammed. I'd love some pointers. JIM: Whoa, let me help you with that Brooke. [MUSIC] JIM: There you go. BROOKE: You know what? I... I need a break. [MUSIC] KENNY: Hey, who's that guy? DREW: I... Can't... Get a good look at him! KENNY: Here, try these. DREW: Intruder alert! Sergeant, man the guns! [MUSIC] JARED: Well, who do we have here? BROOKE: Who's asking? JARED: Jared Cunningham at your service. So where you from, gorgeous? BROOKE: Out west. JARED: Shoulda guessed. There's not any girls half as pretty as you are around here. BROOKE: There's not as many guys half as smart to notice. JARED: So what brings you out here? BROOKE: My fiancé, Clint. JARED: You don't say... [MUSIC] Come on, wanna go have some fun? Let's go... Come with me. [MUSIC] CLINT: Pull! [MUSIC] [MUSIC] GRACE: How'd you learn to shoot like that? CLINT: I've shot a time or two. You know, if you want me to, I can give you a few pointers. [MUSIC] BROOKE: I, uh, I hate to interrupt, but your dad wants something in the..In the shop. GRACE: Thanks. BROOKE: Sorry. [MUSIC] So you were shooting really good! CLINT: Thank you. I move on to the final round, that's fortunate. BROOKE: Good! GRACE: Dad? JARED: Quite the party you got going on. GRACE: Jared! What are you doing here? JARED: Just thought I'd check and see how that, uh, how that like "new direction" was going for ya. GRACE: That's none of your business. JARED: Hey, wait! I wanted to show you something. GRACE: Thanks, but I'm not interested. JARED: It matches the earrings I got ya. Look. GRACE: It's beautiful, but I can't accept it. JARED: Okay, so we went a little too fast. Okay, but we can start over, we can try again. GRACE: That's not the kind of love I want. All you care about is yourself. JIM: How ya doing? Good to see you again. That was some great shooting today... BROOKE: Clint, wait! CLINT: Would you please stop! Just go home! BROOKE: I didn't wait all this time for some good-for-nothing farm girl to come between us! CLINT: There is no more us, Brooke. Excuse me. BROOKE: Clint! JIM: Excuse me. JARED: That doctor's not gonna work out for you anyway. He likes that Brooke girl. GRACE: That was a long time ago! JARED: Well, then why is she here now? GRACE: We're done here. GRACE: Let go of me! JARED: I'm not done! CLINT: Hey! Leave her alone. CLINT: You okay? BROOKE: How romantic! JARED: So... So this is the hero you left me for? Mr. Nice guy? GRACE: Look out! [MUSIC] JARED: Agh! [MUSIC] JIM: That's enough! It's time for you to go! JARED: Let me go! [MUSIC] JARED: When that new direction doesn't pan out, you'll be coming back. JIM: There is nothing for you here, ever. Now get off my property! JIM: You pack your bags, Missy, you've overstayed your welcome too. BROOKE: I'm not leaving until I get what I came for. [MUSIC] CLINT: Let's go. You've done enough damage here. BROOKE: On second thought, home sounds really good about now. CLINT: I wanted to handle this differently. I'm sorry. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] ROBERT: You pass the pancakes, please? JIM: Sure. ROBERT: Thank you. DREW: You shoulda seen the look on Jared's face when Kenny and I shot him. ROBERT: I wonder why Clint had to leave so suddenly? JIM: Things don't always work out as planned. I know he had some stuff to take care of. GRACE: Then why did god let Brooke come and ruin everything? JIM: I can't answer that sweetheart, but I do know that you can still trust him. [MUSIC] KATHERINE: You should write him. And be thankful for what you do have. [MUSIC] GRACE: Dear Clint: I don't know where you are tonight or what you're doing... GRACE: ...But I never got to thank you for defending me last week. I respect you for being a man of principle... ...you've taught me to Cherish and value my parent's blessing, to wait for god's timing... ...and above all, to be satisfied in Christ, whether he brings us together or not. [PHONE RINGING] Thank you for being a true friend. Sincerely, grace. JIM: Sweetheart, you about ready? GRACE: Be there in a second! KATHERINE: Missed a spot. What a lovely young woman you've become. I'm very proud of you. GRACE: What makes you say that? JIM: There you are, Princess! Ready for our mountain excursion? GRACE: Can't wait! JIM: Yeah. Everything's ready. JIM: Time to eat guys. Dogs, and pies, and all the goodies here. ROBERT: Oh man, I'm gonna sit over here. JIM: Why don't you go find grace? Can you do that? That'd be good. [MUSIC] CLINT: It's beautiful, isn't it? GRACE: Clint?! I thought you were... CLINT: I... I had to take care of her. That's not why I went back. GRACE: I can't believe you're here. How did you even know where we were? CLINT: I planned this whole thing with your dad. Actually... I believe god planned this love story. When he brought me to east bend, I couldn't have imagined the blessings he had in store. I came for a job, and discovered a loving family. I put romance on hold, grace. I was waiting on him to bring a woman with character and conviction. Guess that's settled. [MUSIC] Grace Anderson, I've grown to Cherish you over the last few months. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. [Music will you marry me? GRACE: Yes! Yes! CLINT: I was hoping you'd say that. [MUSIC] Come on. Let's go tell your family. [MUSIC] DREW: Mom! Dad! He's here, he's here! [MUSIC] [MUSIC] GRACE: Mmmmm. Our own little piece of heaven. CLINT: So you don't mind staying here in east bend? GRACE: Wherever you go, I'm home. [MUSIC] Dad brought you by something today. CLINT: Soybeans? GRACE: Her future. [MUSIC] DAUGHTER: Do that again! [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
