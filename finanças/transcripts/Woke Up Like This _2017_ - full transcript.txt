--== McEphie ==-- [funky instrumental music playing] [alarm clock ringing] [yawning] [alarm clock beeping] [sighs] [sighs deeply] [moans softly] [yawns] [woman] You are so beautiful. [shower water running] [snoring] [man] Dad! Jolly! Wake up! It's late! -[grunts] Hey. -[vendor] Hot bread! Hot bread! [yawning] Oh. Sir! Eight pesos of hot bread, please! -[vendor] Toasted? -Yes. -Wait for me, okay? Thank you! -[vendor] Okay. [snoring] Never mind! Nanny! Nanny! [upbeat music playing over headphones] -Nanny Medel! -Holy crap! [shouts] Oh! Sorry, ma'am. You're using Spotify again? Yes, ma'am. Sorry. Wait, ma'am. Don't you dare. Let me do this. Sorry. Where's Dad? -I think he went for a jog. -[sighs] [sighs] Bye, Pepper. I love you. [Pepper barks] [upbeat music playing] Oh my! You were both just sleeping peacefully and now you're already eating? Sorry, Son. [sniffs] I smelled the garlic. It's delicious. Hmm! Tasty! And Son, look at this kid. He's so small but he's gluttonous. Uncle Gorio, this is breakfast. The most important meal of the day! What important? That's crap! Son, sometimes you should listen to me. I look like a fool when I'm coaching your team because you're ignoring me! Dad, I already know your play. That's why I know what to do. But still! But wait. Let me ask you. Why did you leave your job? Ah! What you earn might not be enough for him. He eats too much and going to school is expensive now. You know what, Dad. Don't worry about it anymore. When the PBL scout attends our finals, that's it! It's a done deal! What finals? We haven't even won yet and you're already thinking about finals? Just use the triangle offense. The one that Phil Jackson used in Chicago Bulls. Uncle Gorio! Hey! You're being rude! From what I see, you're always interfering with adults! And you intentionally pronounce the "Go" too long. So that it sounds like uncle Go. Dad, that's my coffee. And son, you're getting skinny. Don't diet! Eat well! Wait. [silly sound] I will take a bath now, Papi. I have a very busy day today. Sure. Go ahead first. Such a pity! You're so busy. [Jolly] Okay, Papi. [upbeat music playing] [phone chimes] [Medel] Good morning, ma'am! Hm! Yummy! What's this? Your breakfast, ma'am. The F, nanny? You know that I am on a diet, right? Sorry, ma'am. I've been oblivious lately. Sorry, ma'am. No, no, no, Medel. Just leave it there. -Yes, sir. -Daddy, I'll be tempted! That is a testament to your commitment to your plan! It looks good anyway. Look at that. -[phone rings] -Oh! Wait, wait, wait. Hello! Oh! Carding! What? They can't do that! Made their own demolition! [sighs] Okay, I'll go there right now. Okay. I'm sorry. I have to go. -Okay, Dad. -Okay, sweetheart. -Jolly, got your packed lunch? -Yes, it's already in my bag. [Jolly's dad] Good. Huh? [dramatic scary music playing] Nando! When will you pay your debt? Oh my gosh, Papi. Ursula is here again. I mean Miss Amor. Jolly! The sea cow is here! Uh, I mean Amor. Whales have a strong sense of hearing. Hey, she's Eruption! I mean Amor. The list of your debt is too long already. I need to buy some goods later, so maybe you can… Uh, Amor. Is it okay if I pay my debt next time? Sure. But kiss me first. -Kiss? -Yes. -Ew! -[thrilling music plays] [Jolly] Yuck. Uh… -Okay, sure. But smack only, okay? -Okay. [Jolly] Yuck, Papi. It's disgusting! -Oh! That's John Lloyd Cruz! -Where? -[Jolly] Let's go, Papi. Run! -He's not here! -Let's talk about my debt later! -Bye! [snoring] Paeng. Paeng! -Ma'am! -Let's go. Yes, ma'am. Let's go. [woman] Idiot. [sighs] Excuse me. What are you doing? Sorry, ma'am. Sorry, sorry. My God! Drive. HMCL towers. Use Waze. Don't bother me. I'm still sleepy. [navigation system] Turn right onto Madison Street. In 200 meters, turn left… [cars honking] [upbeat music playing] What is going on? The traffic light is green. Why aren't we moving? I'm late. There's an old man in front. I can't start the car. [groans] [hooter honking] [both clamoring] Hey! [woman yells] Old man, get off the street! You're causing a delay. -[woman] Gosh! -[somber music playing] [Gorio] Get down! Defense! Get down! [tense music playing] Team! Concentrate! You can do it! Nando, you're already tired. I'll get the ball. [crowd cheering] -Nando, nice play! -[whistle blowing] -[man] Why did you snatch the ball? -Get down! Give me that. I'm assisting Nando. Nando! [whistle blowing] -[man] Zero-four! -Charging! Why am I charging, Ref? He's not even in the game! Simply because it's charging. I'm sorry. Charging? He's not a player! Why I am called for? -Nando, I'm sorry. -That's nonsense, ref! This is your fault. You know what? All my life I've never been called for charging foul! Nando? -[Gorio] Okay, that's enough. -[players] Okay. If this happens, all the guards will go to Nando. Yes. When you go to him, that means one player will be free. -Right. -Yes, coach. -Okay? -Yes, sir. Okay. -Nando! -Yes? If someone's free, give the ball. Pass the ball. Hm. Oh, this. Nando! Stop that. Dad, I'm just counting my points. Let him be, coach. Nando is a great player. He can do this. Your back is wet. You might catch a cold. [sighs] [upbeat music playing] Nando! Pass the ball! We're free! Here, Nando! Nando, we're free! [player] Pass it, Nando! Nando, nice play! [chuckling] [Nando] Nice one! Nice one! Great! Why didn't you pass the ball? I shot the ball, Dad. That's not what I am asking you to do. But we won, Dad. Because that's not what I want you to learn. What's with you? Nando! Congrats! You're great! You shot the ball. Nice play! You're really good! Come here. You know what? You're amazing. Imagine. Five were guarding you, but you still managed to shoot the ball. [photographer] Okay. Energy. Nice! Good shot! Okay! One more! One more! One more! One more! Okay, nice! Yes! -[photographer] That's it! -Work it! Love it! Take off your clothes. Very good. Very good! Yes! That's it! Okay. One more. That's it! And… Okay. Fine! Nice. Eh-- Kit, is that a hypoallergenic brush? By this time, you should know what happens, right? I get an allergic reaction if it isn't. Hey, this brush is expensive. I got it when I was in the U.S. Okay, fine, I trust you. Uhm, excuse me. Aren't we done yet? -It's because I'm tired. -[photographer] Yes? A few more, Sabrina. Alright, a few more shots. Get it, please. Alright, I'm ready! Alright, then. Change angle. Okay, that's good. -This is expensive. -Okay, good. -Don't mind her. -Chin up! Okay, good. Okay, good. [energetic music playing] There you are. Hi! [photographer] Nice! One more shot! Okay. Work it. You're late. Did your makeup artist had a hard time making you beautiful? No. You're just too excited. Isn't your schedule full today? Mine is so hectic. Well, darling, the early bird catches the worm. He who does not know how to look back from whence he came, will never get to his destination. [photographer] Okay, ready. And! And! And! And! Show happy dance! -Hey! -[photographer] And! -[laughing] -[shutter clicking] There! Very good! -And! And! -[Sabrina] Excuse me. [man] Nando, have a drink! I'll pass on that. Thank you! Nando, my love! I thought of a way to forget about your debt. Just one night. Let's forget everything. I'll just pay up. And wait a minute, Amor. I need to fetch Jolly. Jolly? Jolly? It's Jolly again! This time, can't it be me? -Where did you get that child and-- -Sh. Jolly is a very important child for me. Even though he's not my son. [gentle music plays] [Nando] Jolly… He's Tessa's child. I dreamt of marrying her. For me, she's my one true love. That's why I'm going to do everything so that she'll be happy. Even though… as her best friend. Her best friend's best friend. See. He looks stupid, right? SCREW YOU, NANDO! Thank you. Thank you? No! I'm so in love with you, Tessa. I'm the one who's so in love with you, Lance. You know, whenever we're together, it feels like heaven. That hurts! [giggles] -[Nando] That should be me! -Let's go. [heaving] [Tessa screams] -[tires screech] -[crashing] [Nando] Even though it hurts, I've accepted it. She made me Jolly's godfather. Dead end. Sorry. The end. That's why Jolly is so important to me. Okay, then I will be Jolly's mother. Hey! Why are you here? I was just going to pick you up. Papi, I was waiting for you for ages! I came out early. Can you pay the driver? She made me tell a story! We'll go ahead. He's hungry. I'm not yet hungry… [pained moaning] -He's already hungry. -Yes, I am. [laughs] Hurry up! [Nando] Faster! Faster! -Get off me! -[lively music playing] [Archie clears throat] Anyway. I heard you're joining the search for the supermodel of the whole wide Philippines. Yeah! And what is it to you? Nothing. Good luck! Hey! Archie, let's go! You're such a pervert! Come on! -Come on. Start the car! -Last shot! See you around. I hope not. You wish! [Sabrina] She's so annoying. Don't mind her. You'll just be stressed out. I have an idea. Why don't we just go out tonight? Really? -Ah! -Ah. Yeah, I think we should go out tonight. The club is missing the squad girls! Well, yeah. I think I need to de-stress properly before the contest. And besides, my Instagram needs an update, so I think it's time to feed the press and the fans! So I think we are going out tonight! -[squeals] -G! What the F is G? Game. Stop trying to make G happen. It's never gonna happen! [screams, laughing] I'm so excited! -[girls] Party! -[Sabrina] Come on! [Sabrina] I haven't been out in years! Oh my God, I'm going to drink a lot. [girl] And there will be so many boys! Bro! I can get us in here. When he sees my face, -I'm sure he'll let us in. -Alright. Stay here. Bro, let us in, please. My friend and I will celebrate his birthday. Can you please? I'll be embarrassed if not. You know I cannot do that. Employees are not allowed inside if they are not on duty. Come on. You're so annoying. What now? If we can't get in, let's just go. No, we can. Bro, wait a sec. Bro, let us in, please. It's because… [muttering] I cannot do that! You are so annoying! You're crazy! I said no! No! I said no! I thought you could get us in. Why-- -You're so annoying! -Ouch! Get out of here! [Baste] Come on! [groaning] [upbeat music playing] [Sabrina scoffs] What a loser. [girls laugh] -[man] Good evening, ma'am. -[Sabrina] Hi, Bobby. Did you see that? [crowd screaming] [girl] Thank you! -[man] Hi, babe! -Oh my God! You must be kidding. -Hey! Here it is! -There it is! Whoo! Alright. Take it easy, Sabrina. It's too early. You're right. I don't want to look wasted in my snaps. -Let me take a picture. Pose. -Oh, here we go. One more! Enough. Please make sure to tag me and don't use too many filters, okay? -Yes, ma'am. No problem. -Ew! Where is Chachi? Maybe she's hanging out with someone. [laughing] -As if! -[Kitty] That wouldn't happen. Smile! Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. -Surprise, Sabrina! Happy birthday! -My God! Happy birthday. Sabrina! -There you go. -Thank you. -She's so beautiful! -What's with you? Are you drunk? It's too narrow here. I'm sorry. Who are you talking about? I didn't see hot chicks. They went past us! What I saw was my bald co-worker that didn't let us in. Sorry about that. It's your birthday today. Bro, that's alright. What's important is, even though we didn't go in, you remembered my birthday. [chuckles] Not only did I remember our birthday, I also have a gift for you. What? Tada! You're the best, bro! And you also have a cake! Tada! And candle. Is this a cake? Yes! Why does it look like cat poop? No! That's a cake! [Chachi] Make a wish, Sabrina! -This is so cheesy! -Go, girl! [dramatic music playing] [alarm clock beeping] [bouncy music playing] [gasping, spitting] [screaming] [Pepper barks] Pepper! [playful music] [gasping] [whimpering] [gasping] [groaning] [whimpering] [continues whimpering] There's a rabbit! [Sabrina] Hey! Jackpot! Who is this? Oh. You're such a chick! Happy birthday to me! Mmm! It's not that big, but… But… it's fine. Here. Whoo! Ha! Well-groomed. I think this is itchy. [Gorio] Nando! -The sun's out! Wake up! -[knocking] Nando! Son. Son, wake up. Happy birthday. I cooked some rice noodles. Come on. Let's eat. Follow me. [in deep voice] Okay, I'll come in a minute. Huh? [suspenseful music playing] What--! You're too beautiful! And you're so sexy! -Who are you? -Dad! It's me. Nando. You're not… Nando! Who's your mom? -Why? -Dad, it's me! I don't have a daughter! But that can't be! Because we were just holding hands while… -Come on, Dad! -Don't come near me! I will kiss you! Come on, Dad! I will explain. But let's eat first. Okay. You're so beautiful. [shrieks] It's so annoying! [shrieks] [sighs] Hi, Nanny. Who are you? How did you get in? -Why are you wearing Sabrina's clothes? -Nanny. Let me explain, okay? I am Sabrina. Who's Sabrina? Who are you calling Nanny? I'll kill you before you can get out! -Nanny, I am Sabrina! -One more time! You're imitating my boss's gestures, alright! Don't do that to me! I will call the police! Don't do that to me, Nanny! Chu! Don't move! Nanny… [Medel] Hurry up! Ouch! [whimpering] Chu! Catch that guy! Don't let him get away! You're just my gardener. [slaps] You're the gardener! You should guard! Call the police! [Nando shouting] -[sobbing] -[somber music playing] -[Medel] Hey! Come back here! Come back! -[tense music accelerates] [Medel] You thought you'll get away! You run too fast! Nanny, it's me! Come here! I'll beat you up! [shouts] [grunts] One more time! Here it goes! [Nando] I'm restraining myself! I don't want to do this, but… I saw your black pantie! You're getting on my nerves! I'm holding myself up! [Medel] I'll go inside! Another one! I think it's really Papi, Uncle. They have the same appetite. Hey, stop that! I've been telling you not to interfere in adult conversation, right? Hm. [Baste] Nando! -Uncle Gorio! Where's Nando? -Why? Wow! Food! Is there a plate left? Where's Nando? Nando! Nando! Where's Nando? It's his birthday today. Wow! That's why there are rice noodles! Where's Nando? [lips smacking] She's too young for you, uncle Gorio! You're already impotent, right? Let me bet on that, huh? Baste, come. I need to tell you something. Why? -Just a minute. -What is it, uncle? -[Gorio] Stop bothering me! -Ouch! Give that to me! Can you stop taking over our kitchen? Go to the basketball court! Go on! Hey! Spare some of that! Oh my! I swallowed it! It's missing! Dad, what clothes did you let me wear? You should have given me a basketball jersey and shorts instead. Don't call me Dad. I have not proven that you are Nando. You cannot wear the uniform yet. Because something might show off from the uniform. Then how can I prove it to you, Dad? It's easy. I will find out for myself. -On that court. -Alright! -Okay. -Okay. [Baste] Here, in the arm string. Are your calves okay? Your foot should be… [moaning] Hey, Baste, what are you doing? Wait a sec! He fell from the third floor. I'm stretching him! [bone cracking] [Baste] Sorry. Okay, you can go. I will talk to coach. My friend fell from the third floor. [chuckles] What is it? You told me to come here, Uncle. I mean coach! Will I play against you? Not me. My ligaments are in bad shape today. -Are you my opponent? -Not him! He's too small. -Then who's my opponent? -My niece. Is she your niece? I thought she's your girlfriend. I don't deal with relatives! That's right! Because it's incest! Girlfriend… I thought she's your girlfriend. She's too young. No! Just play basketball. Girl, Nando's number one because he's my best friend,* but if he was not my best friend, I'll be… [gasp] Where are you? [Baste] You're rude! We're still talking? You're crossing over already? Now try to get past me. I will guard you keenly. Get past me. [laughs] Go past me! [laughs] Go past me… Aha! So that's one of your moves, huh? Here is my plan. Let's see if you can still get past me. Don't let her go past you. -Make sure to guard her! -Okay! -Yes! Say it to me! -Yes! Countrymen! Guard her the best you can! Don't let her go through! [all] Yes! [shouting] [vendor] Hot bread! Hey! Mister! I'll buy some. -[Chachi] Did you like your cake? -[Kitty] No. It was okay, but it's really not even worth the calories. Hi, girls! Do you know what happened to me? Pepper was barking continuously. That's why I woke up. When I got up, my! My head was really hurting from my hangover. When I went downstairs, I saw Nanny Medel. She mistook me for a robber. However, Jun was calm. I ran away, but Nanny Medel still went after me. We threw slippers at each other. My other one is missing. That's why I texted you to meet up. And thank you for your time, girls. Uhm… Excuse me. Who are you? I'm Sabrina! Sab? I'm not Sab, I'm not Rina. I'm Sabrina! Duh! [laughs] Sorry, Sab. But wait. Are you really Sabrina? [silly music playing] Okay, I know a secret about you. Your favorite food is sweet chocolate rice porridge with anchovies and ketchup! What? How did you know that? It's a squad girl's best-kept secret! You eat that after going to the gym, right? I know that because I am Sabrina! Believe me! You're speaking loud intentionally, huh? -[screams] -Ouch! It really hurts! You might have rabies! [whimpering] You're so annoying! Help me. I don't know what happened to me! I just woke up like this! I need your help! Please believe me! This is me… Sorry, Sabrina. It's just that we love you dearly, and love hurts, right? [whimpers] I apologize also If I spilled out your secrets. Girls, can you do me a favor? -What is it? -Sure! Can I take revenge? [shouts] -Ouch! Wait. -[phone beeps] [coughing, choking] Guys! We have work! -Wait! -[coughs] Tomorrow's final casting to main character for the Dahlia commercial! -[shrieking] -Yes! Girls, if I get in for the final TVC, party! Party! Oh no. With that body? OMG! You're right! That's so nice! -Oh. Do you have a swimsuit for summer? -Yeah! I already bought one. Can't wait to see him! Here comes the queen! -Oh my gosh! -I wonder what she'll wear. -Hm… -[Kitty] Is that it? Hm-mm. Honey, no. [Chachi] Not the season for florals! [giggling] [Kitty] What is that? She looks like an old lady! Ew! -Oh my God! -No! [Chachi] That's not a trend! [girls gasp] [girls] Oh my… [retching] Oh my God! Your legs! It looks like it has to be caged. Oh my God! I don't deserve this. You know what? Let's get waxed. [squealing] Stop making G happen. Hmm. [squealing] His body is so hairy, it might hurt. Come on. You're not that hairy. Here. I'm like a teddy bear. That's okay. Girls have higher pain tolerance. You're not allowed here. Get in here. Get in! Girls? [whimpers] [whimpering] [screams] [therapist] Get in here! [screams] Come here! Hey, you! Come back here! It's your turn! What now? The cross over move you did, I taught that to Nando. But I'm not convinced about you yet. Tell me things that only Nando and I know. So that you can convince me. Come on. That's easy. -What now? -Hm! You called Mom "Ling" when she was alive! -See! I am right! -[laughs] Hey! I call all the women I've been with "Ling". You're a little closer. One more. Hm! When I was young, you got injured because you did the same cross over I did a while ago! And you broke your knees. You're just lucky! -Luck! One more! -Is that  a lucky guess? Ah! You have a red mark on your butt and there are two big moles inside of it! -How did you know? I never showed you! -Of course I know! -You are my child! -I missed you! -Kiss me! -Hey! stop it! Dad, come on! Stop it! [Kitty] He has to be around here. He won't leave us, right? [Kitty] There he is. Is that him? [Chachi] What is he doing? [Kitty] Is he okay? [sobbing] [blowing] Sabrina, what happened to you? Why did you run off? OMG, girls! This is what happened. There's this guy who wanted to wax my legs. He looks like Shrek, and he's so scary AF! That's why I ran off! Look. It's not yet done. That's okay. But don't worry, I am okay. Just… You know me. I am okay if we are… Shopping! [upbeat music playing] [man] Sweetheart, hurry! Smile. -[woman] Here it is! -OMG! What are those? [shutter clicking] Do you want me to hurt you? But your husband is handsome. -Of course! -Don't mind them, sweetheart. Hey! Can you please stop walking back and forth? I can't stop sweeping because you're dropping all your crumbs. Dad, what am I going to do? Our game's in a few days. [gasps] You know what? Are you really asking me? I don't even know where you were last night. Where were you? [gasps] I know what I should do, Dad! [bright music playing] [Nando] This is good for me. [Bobby] This way Ma'am. You can go in, ma'am. Ma'am, hold on for a minute. Ma'am Sabrina. Ma'am, you don't need to be in line. -Huh? -Yes, ma'am. -Go this way, ma'am. -Is that so? Yes, ma'am. You don't have to be in line. You're good to go. [Nando] Thank you. [Bobby] Alright then, come in. Okay, ma'am, you can go in. Ma'am, hold on for a minute. You can't come in! -Excuse me, Mr. Bouncer. -[Bobby] Yes, ma'am. She's… He's… He's with us! Oh, he's with you? Hm-mm. Sorry, ma'am, sir. [Bobby] You can come in! I almost forgot, Miss Kitty. Ma'am Sabrina's already inside. [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you! [Bobby] Welcome. -[man] Sir? Can you-- -Hey! -Stop poking me! -[man] I was going to ask. [fake barking] [energetic music playing] Hi, Tyler. Don't you have a birthday gift for me? [laughs] [smooching sound] Come on, babe, maybe he just wants a picture with me. [Kirsten] Give me your phone. Hurry. Faster! Oh my… Smile, smile, smile! [moans] Here. We're good. Go on. Thank you! -You're pissing me off! -Oh my God! That's our song! Come on! [barking sounds] [giggling] [screeches] [crowd cheering] [energetic music playing] [crowd cheering] [crowd] Go, Sabrina! Go! What are you doing to my body? You are not wearing a bra! -Why? You're not wearing a bra either, -Pervert! So what? What are we going to do now? You are scratching! Does my body already have rashes? I used a detergent in my bath. I didn't know it was itchy. And you! What did you do with my hair? You made it like rice noodles! Look at what you're wearing. Am I a lesbian? Look at what I am wearing now. You're wearing makeup! Lipstick's same color as your top! Guys! Guys! Enough of that. I have an idea! Why not bump into each other? [shrieks] Your friend's stupid. Hey! Don't say that. Only I can say that. Stupid! [both screaming] [laughing] Guys, I have another idea! Why not kiss? Kiss each other! Right? Yes! -Stupid! -Stupid! And I don't kiss strangers! I am a… [moaning] -Didn't work. -Didn't work. Here it is! It's the last and brightest idea. One of you will jump from here and the other one will catch him or her downstairs! [Chachi] That's it! I think that's it! Don't follow me. You're the one who's following me. I'm the first one here as you can see I'm walking ahead of you. [laughs] You think I'm the one? Nando! Sabrina! How are you? -Eh… You know us? -Who are you? I am Grandpa Junior. I was brought here to teach you a lesson! But wait. You really don't remember me? -Uh… -Ah… -No. -No. I thought I was famous. Well, let's rewind. [fantasy music playing] It's your fault! Hey! Old man, get off the street! You're delaying people! Okay. Wait. Wait a second. Whatever we did, we are very sorry. If you can please change us back to our own bodies so that… everything will be in place. Hmm. No, I can't. You are being punished because both of you are terrible! Me? Now, you should think about all the bad things you did here on earth! You'll be returning to your own bodies if, and only if you complete each other's mission. Wait. What did I do to you? I'm like a saint. -[scoffs] -[stammers] Grandpa Junior? [sighs] [car honking] -Is that my stomach? -[stomach growling] Oh, here. [Nando] Get this. Put that here. [girl] Thank you. Can you slow down? Because I have a final casting tomorrow, and I don't want to look bloated. It's free. So, what will do you, Sabrina? Casting is tomorrow's and you haven't returned to your bodies. Actually, that's what I was thinking. If ever Kirsten's going to be chosen, she will piss me off! That's why I hate this! Why? I also have a game tomorrow. We need to win that game so we will be in the championship. As if I have nothing going on too. I have a feeling that you're not going to return to your bodies yet. What if you swap in the meantime? Sabrina, you play his basketball game, while Nando, you'll attend Sabrina's casting. -Right? -Uh-uh! -No, I don't think so! -No way! -No, I don't think so! -No way! Come to think of it, if we have time, we can still ask the doctors how you can return to your own bodies. But both of you have an urgent event. Don't make a scene. You! Don't let us down! You! Don't stammer. You know, guys, let's just do this. Tomorrow, we will fix your outfits so that we can plan properly. And we'll do it at your place. Hmm! What is this? Sleepover? -Are we all taking a bath together? -Stop it! Good morning, girls. Good morning, princess! -Hi, Uncle! -Good morning! [gasping, slurping] So, princess? Who's your friend? Hm. Hm. Hm! Nan… Nando. He's Nando. -Good morning. -Hi, Nando. I'm Nandice. Sab is so funny. I'm Kitty's assistant. [Kitty] He's right. [Dad] Anyways, I have a hearing to attend to, so I'll leave you girls for now. -[Chachi] Right. -[Kitty] Take care, Uncle. Nice meeting you. -This tastes good. -[Chachi] Nice food. [whispers] Bye, Dad. [sniffing] Bye, bro! I mean Dad. I miss my dad. [sighs] It's so hot. Hi, girls! Hi! Whatever happens, this TVC should be yours. Wow! Talk about pressure! I believe in you, Nando. You can do this. Thank you, Kitty. Come on, guys. Don't make such a big deal out of it. I can do this. This is so easy. Sure bet. I will get this. What do I need to do? What? Should the pose be like this? Or this? -It's so easy. -[Kirsten laughs] Well, well, well. Good luck tonight, girls. Don't put too much effort into this because it may be a waste. Well, I'm getting this campaign. [laughs] -[shouts] -[girls gasp] Is she on drugs? Who is she? And what's the problem if she gets the commercial, anyway? You're all rich. It's not about the money. Chachi's and my careers are on the line here. As stylist and makeup artist. So please, if you can't do it for yourself, do it for me. I don't want to expect any more. I don't want to be in second place. [gentle music playing] Excuse me. Sabrina? Your turn. -[clears throat] -[bright music playing] This is it, bros. [chuckling] Excuse me. You can't come. -Okay. -[laughs] You can't come. Let's go. You can't come. [Gorio] Nando! It's nice that you fixed yourself. Game? [shrieks] [grunts] -Nando? -Nando, let's go! -Game? -[shrieks] [clears throat] Why did you slap me? I missed you. Don't ever miss me again. [sobbing] Something's not right. Something's wrong. It seems… I left my wallet. Right, I left my wallet. I should head home. Nando, do your best. Our opponent plays well. [sobs] You're not Papi, right? Gosh! What are we going to do? Let's go! [feel-good music playing] Thank you! Thank you! That's good. Nice! [grunts] -[man] Hi, Sabrina! How are you? -Hi! [Gorio] Nando! You're open. Shoot it! -Shoot, Nando, shoot! -[whistle blowing] Three! Black ball! Yes, three points! That's three seconds violation! Nice play! Alright. Okay, ready. Three, two, one, and… action. Skin so elegant. Skin so vibrant. Skin so adorable. Skin so beautiful. -Dahlia. -[camera clicks] The soap of celebrities. [laughing] [crowd cheering] [whistle blowing] Traveling! [whistle blowing] [referee] Foul! Ref, he smells awful. Smell him. Even you smell awful. Dahlia. The soap of celebrities! [chuckles] Are you making fun of me? We're serious here. Look who's serious here? -[gasps] -[muttering] Did you just stick your tongue out? What were you thinking? Huh? Are you on drugs? Hey, are you even listening? Sorry. You're apologizing? Huh? -What have you been taking? -It's a miracle! He's apologizing. Did you actually see that? A woman doesn't actually do that. [man] And where is she going? [Gorio] Nando! Shoot! [shrieks] -Nando! -Stop it! I don't want to! -Nando, it's yours! -I said I don't want it! -Nando! -That's my ball! That's mine, right? That's mine. Alright, it's your ball. [whistle blows] -Hey! -Nando, nice play! You're so good! What do you call that play? -Yay! -What are you doing? We lost! Nando never loses! Nando never passes the ball! He's greedy! And… and… and he is boastful! Who are you? [deep sigh] [delicate music playing] [Nando] Come on! I thought you're a shooter. One more. One more. Now, the next game will be much harder. Star players will be our opponent! How about you? You're failing in simple English. So what? I didn't know that you had to speak English there. Do you know how to speak English? Huh? Oh gosh, guys. You have to watch this. Dahlia. The soap of celebrities! [gasps] My phone! Come on! They're the only friends you have! Don't act like you're a good person. It seems your dad isn't happy with your attitude. [screams] Do it! [grunts] What are you doing? Unlike you, I use my head. Of course, I won't hurt myself. Oh, so that's how you want it to be, huh? Wait. What are you going to do? [light music playing] -No! -No! Even if there's no bread, I can still eat this! Okay, if you do that… This! I will cut this! Oh, really! Let's see. [voice trembling] Don't try me! I will slice it! I will slice it! I will slice it! [heavy breathing] [screams] [Medel] Ma'am Sabrina! Somebody is looking for you outside. [heavy breathing] -I'll be the one! Stop it! Come on! -[Nando] I said I'll do it! Come on! We can see you. [giggles] You can see me? Oh my! Mother F! [grunts] You have awful mouths! You're here. Come on! Just do what you have to do and go! To get everything back to normal, what do we have to do? -Thank God! -Five hundred! [inhales] There you go! -Okay, here. -There! -[Nando] Please! -We're ready! -[Sabrina] Wait. -[Nando] Okay. Where are you going? You have to push it. Where are you going? Just a minute. My money put into his waist. There you go! [chuckles] Now, here's what we're going to do. Face each other. -Close your eyes. -Face each other. And think of everything bad that you've done. And then, when you open your eyes, you'll be normal again! Whoo! Here we go. [Nando] I can't think of any. It's hard to be perfect. For me, I have many. [grunts, howls, giggles] [Nando] What now? What's happening? What now? I don't feel anything! Me too. I don't feel… Sorry, sorry. [grunts] What now? Friends! I saw it. You did not close your eyes! That's bogus! I thought you can help us. Did I say that? Yes! We paid 500 hundred, right? It came from here. Give it back. 500? I gave it to the cab driver. I have no cash. He can't do anything for us. I'll just go home. Hey, Nands! Where are you going? Eh? [Sabrina] Hey! Where are you going? Wait! Going home? No! Don't take my body to that stinky place. Ew! There are so many cockroaches! So, you leave. I'll stay here, in your big but empty house. [mysterious music playing] He's gone! Uh… [Sabrina] Hey, Nando! Let's talk. Wait up! Nando! -Nando! -[door clicks shut] Hey! This is my house! Open up! [grunts] [snoring] [continues snoring] [gentle music playing] [moaning] [moans] [grunts] [exhales] Why me? There are so many people far worse than me. Why me? And… This house. It's indeed small. Narrow. But why… are they so happy? Why me? I have a spacious house, but there's something missing. I miss my dad. I miss Jolly. [clicks tongue] [inhales] I don't want this kind of life. Money's easy, but it's still lonely. [sobbing] [busy signals] LET'S MEET UP. LET'S FIX THIS. [sighs] Baste! What are you doing here? What do you mean by what am I doing here? I always sleep beside you. Nando, I feel hurt. Do you know why? I came here on your birthday. Uncle Gorio and his girlfriend were the only ones here. I lost my appetite since you're not here! You went out on your birthday? And when we were playing, you didn't talk to me, Nando. But why? I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not feeling well? I'm not feeling well? Nando, you spoke English? You can speak English? [giggles] -Ouch! -[slaps] [giggles] You know what? I'm so fond of you! No, what I meant was… There are many things bothering me. Many things bothering you? You hit me hard, Nando. My cheekbone hurts! Because you are so funny! If you're not really mad at me… join me. Please help me. [Baste singing] I love taking a bath. Right, Nando? Better when we do it to-- Hey! Nando. Why are you still dressed? Take it off! Are you embarrassed? Really? We've been doing this for so long. Come on! [whimpers] This soap is so foamy. Nando, can you scrub my back, please? OMG! It has hair! Oh, sorry. [whimpering] What is happening? Nando! At my back, here. [whimpering] Nando, I have a boil in my butt. It should have exploded last week. Can you pop it? If it splatters, just avoid it. -[whimpers] -Can you pop it, Nando? Hold on, Nando. -Here's my cellphone -Oh! I saw your ass! [sobs] Nando, here's my cellphone. Record a video so I can upload it to social media. Don't you want to use Facebook live? Yes, we can do that. [playful music] [dog barks] [phone ringing] [sighs] [phone continues ringing] Hello? What happened? Who made you cry? Where is he? Where is he? Hey, you're overreacting. You're making a scene. Are you okay? [whimpers] Guys, people are looking. I don't care! [sobbing] What really happened? I gave him another chance, but… he F-ed it up again! I hate Marvin! Are men all the same? [sobbing] Not all. Don't worry, Kitty. I have a plan. You're squad girls, right? Leave it to me. Aww. -[girl] Baby boy, are you okay? -[light music playing] [bartender] Good evening What's your order? -Stay here, Star Apple. -Alright. [Kitty] Can I have two mandarin martinis, please? [bartender] Okay, ma'am. [clears throat] Kitty, get over it! We're done! It's over! If you still love me, you're just a friend to me. [sighs] [sobbing] [whimsical music playing] Kitty, who's this cheap-looking guy here? Cheap? Who is this? You're cheap! Do cheap ones have pockets inside? I'm not. You're cheap. Say it again and I will hit you hard! Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! You said it four times, huh! [grunts] Sabrina! Mind your own business! [grunts] You're down, boy! Mh? [grunting] Don't even think about it. I can't even! Baby boy, hurry up! Let's go! -Okay, let's go! Hurry up! -[Marvin] Faster! Come on! -Hurry up! -Move faster! Faster! You should have taken the food out. Hey! I may look like a man, but I am straight. But you rolled your tongue. I'm just in character. Cheers, guys. [laughing] Wait. Is that Grandpa? Yes, it is. Girls, wait here. Grandpa, what's up! Look up to the sky. Come on, Grandpa. We know what will happen. You will disappear if we do that. I won't. Hold on to my rooster if you want. [humming] [whimsical music playing] [lizard squeaking] [snoring] [continues snoring] Hoo! -[Nando] Come on! -Sorry, sorry. The conditions aren't right yet. But wait. You need to complete your mission before the first rain hits the middle of the day. If not, you'll stay in those bodies forever! OMG! What should we do? Nando, don't ask him again. He might ask for money. We need to ask him because I don't know what we should do. So what? Eh-- [Sabrina] Grandpa? Grandpa! That's what I was saying. We should've kept an eye on him. [phone chimes] BRO, I'M EXCITED FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP. NICE PLAY. SABRINA, THE SEARCH IS IN A FEW DAYS. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WEAR? You know what, Nando? I think we need to work together. There's a reason why this is happening. Ouch! [gasps] Ouch. You need to do this properly. It's simple to dribble a ball. [feel-good song playing] [man wolf whistling] Ouch! Ouch! Stop it! [Sabrina] Why now? Why now? It's so annoying! Hey! Are you nervous? Is it obvious? Of course, I am. Me too. So please stop that. It's making me nauseous. Huh? Nauseous! Where did it come from? Nauseous. Come on, guys, I heard it on TV. [door clicks open] Anyway, you look surprised, Sabrina. I did not come here to fight. I came here to make friends! Huh? [Kirsten] It's nothing really. I just want us to stop with all the bickering. Let's just work. What is that? What did she say before "let's work"? What is it? You're so funny lately. Here. Uhm… Here's my peace offering. I brought wine! [chuckles] Eh… I brought wine! Did someone say wine? [chuckles] What took you so long? [both] It's good for your nerves and for the mind too. Let's just be friends! You know, just like before. When we started. Let's make peace, not war. [Kirsten] Archie, baby! Wine, please. Yes, munchkin! Mm-hm. Thank you. Here you go. Huh-uh-uh! Wait. Sabrina, can you tell your P.A. that I did not put anything in it? I'm going to drink also. And if you want, let's switch our wine glasses. [squeals] -Bad idea… -No, that's alright. Give it to me. Shot! -Toast! -[Nando] Come on. Mm… I'll see you later. [evil laughter] Did you do what I asked you to? I put it all in her wine glass. [shrieks] Very good, baby! [cackling] [upbeat music playing] Are you okay? I'm kind of nervous. Come on. I believe in you. You're so beautiful. Whoo! [laughs] Is this mine? Number 14, you're next. This way, please. Wish me luck. [giggles] [Sabrina] Come on, bro. Let's do this! You did that! She did it. You did it? [crowd applauding] -[stomach rumbling] -[audience clapping] Ha! [farting noise] Oh! [loud farting] Nando! What's with you, Nando? Hurry! The program's going to start! Nando? [farting] -Oh my God! -Violent explosion! Nando? [Sabrina] Nando! What are… It's so big! Ew! Guys! It's already starting. Let's go! -Nando! -I can't reach the door. There. He's dead. Dumb. He's not dead. What are we going to do? [host] Candidate number 13. Kirsten Salvador! [crowd applauding] [gentle song playing] [host] Let's welcome candidate number 14. Sabrina Rodriguez. [woman] Is she the candidate from earlier? Oooh. So classy! [woman] She looks different. [man] I like what she's wearing. Wow! I like her gown. [woman] Who's that girl? [woman] Is she the candidate from earlier? [man] She's not even in the competition! [twinkling] [crowd clapping] Get off! I'm so beautiful. It's so amazing! [Sabrina] What happened? How did you recover? My stomach is immune to that! See? What? It's because you don't have any bacteria in your body. Us? If we eat rotten food, we just poop it, and it's gone. Don't use that word. It's disgusting! [host] Coming up next, the Q&A section. Wait. It's now Q&A. Are you ready? Do you trust me? Are you nervous? You can do it. Me? Nervous? This? [raspberry sound] [host] Let's welcome candidate number 13. Ms. Kirsten Salvador. [snickering] Hello. [female judge] Good evening, candidate number 13. Hello! [female judge] Here's your question. Who pushed you to join the search for the supermodel of the whole wide Philippines? I am so proud to say that it is none other than my mother. Because my mother is always my pusher. Thank you! Pusher! I'll arrest your mother! [giggles] Thank you! Thank you! A round of applause to our finalist Kirsten Salvador. Let's call our next candidate. Candidate number 14. Ms. Sabrina Rodriguez. [clears throat] If you were a man, what would you do to create change? What? I beg your pardon? Eh… If you were a man, what would you do to create change? As all of you know, -[gentle music playing] -change is not in our bodies. Whether I am a man or a woman, I will still do the same. What's important is to take responsibility for your actions. I will put my heart in whatever I am doing because… for me, true change starts with… love. Sex orientation doesn't matter at all. And that's what I believe. There it is. There you go. Thank you. [clapping] [male judge] Good answer. -[announcer] What an answer. -I like it. That's my girl! Thank you. Candidate number 14. Thank you. And the winner of the supermodel of the whole wide Philippines is… You don't have a chance. It's mine! I don't think so! -Would you shut up! -…candidate number 14! -[host] Sabrina Rodriguez! -[crowd applauds] Congratulations to the new supermodel of the whole wide Philippines! -[host] Miss Sabrina Rodriguez! -[cheering] Judges, please join us to present the award to this beautiful lady. [crowd cheering] [cheering] See! [screaming] [screaming] I'm so proud of you. You were the one who taught me how to pose like this. [laughs] I didn't do it. That was you. [screaming] -Wait. I need to call someone. -[Nando] Alright! Excuse me. -[girls scream] -[Sabrina] Hi, Dad. [Sabrina's dad] Hello, honey. I wanted to tell you that… We won. Congratulations, my child. Why does your voice sound like that? Eh… No, dad, it's just that I'm sick. And Dad, I wanted to tell you something. I know that I've been a stubborn daughter, and you have been such a good father, Ehm… but I wanted to ask for your forgiveness. For what? I should understand you more. It's okay, honey. What's important is, I have to adjust. If there is a chance, I'll give you quality time, just to be with you. Thank you, my princess. I love you, Dad. I love you too, Sab. Don't call me Sab! Come on! -Enough of this, Dad. Bye! -Bye! [Kitty] Champion. No, that's wrong! -Don't mind them. -Cheaters! Karma is real! -You picked the wrong enemy! -I will take revenge! [hooter honking, tires screeching] [crowd] Oh my God! What happened? [host] We are checking in the battle championship here in Tondo! [cheering] -[crowd] Thunders! Thunders! -[girls] Go, Nando! Here he is, the representative from Tondo. -The Tondo Thunders! -[crowd cheering] -[crowd] Go, Thunders! -[Baste] Get out of the way! Get out! [host] You know, partner? The Thunders should have been relaxed at this time… [Baste] Out of the way! [host] …but their star player has been acting strange at the semi-finals. Let's just call him Nandolf. [Jerry in TomTom's voice] Nandolf? It sounds like Nando. Hey, TomTom! Don't expose me here. [Jerry in TomTom's voice] Don't be like that Jerry. Maybe you want me to expose your secrets, Jerry. Hey! [Nando] Don't be nervous. You can do it. Just don't forget what I taught you, alright? Ew! Stop it, Nando! I don't want my hair to be messy during the game. Yuck! Your saliva! -You're the best! -Stop it! You can do it, Sabrina. We believe in you. I believe in you. Okay! Okay! But please stop flirting! -Do your best! -Yeah! [cheering] [Kitty] Go, girl! Nando, is that you? -Hello, Dad. -[gasps] -Don't worry, Dad, he can do it! -How did you get there? You were… -Yes, Uncle, I can do this. -You can do it? Okay, I'll give it to you. -Ouch! -Do your best! That woman's strong. She was there. Defense! We need defense! [cheering] [dramatic music playing] [Jerry] Tondo Thunders can use this chance to go home or to say goodbye to their loved ones! As you can see, the Meanstars are ready to finish everyone here. Oh my… Help us! Jerry, you're dead! Jerry's wife sent a message that she saw her cousin's underwear in their cabinet! How did that happen? I know that I was being careful. [Jerry] The tension is so high. Here it is! Jump ball! And the Meanstars got the ball! [Baste shouting] [shouting] [Jerry] And… here's the first score! [Gorio] Go down! Down! [Baste] Nando! Nando! And it's another score for their opponent! [Gorio] Come on! Come on! No foul? There you go, friends. The game's great! It's fair to all of them. You're right, Jerry. If only the Meanstars are up by eight, it is indeed fair. [laughs] High five! [cheering continues] Baste! Go for the ball! So that Nando can penetrate! Guard him! Huh? -Guard him! -[Baste] Okay! [tense music playing] I feel something for you. I think I already love you. Will you marry me? -He doesn't want to, Uncle Gorio. -[Gorio] Idiot! [Baste] I should have courted him first. [coach] You know what to do! You let your hair grow and felt like you're someone else already! You too! You know the play but you're not doing it! You're running all over, and you're useless! You're running, but you're not guarding our opponent! Your fat burner isn't working! Huh? You too! You're in a panic! Since you used glutathione, your gameplay disappeared! I'm so pissed off with you guys! If this guy comes in, hurt him! When the game ends, make sure he has bloody lips. That's all I want. All of them will go home full of blood. -Understand? -[team] Yes, couch. All of you are stupid! Come on! Go back there! Make sure to fix your gameplay! I'm pissed off with you. You know what to do. Good luck! You too, okay? Do your best, okay. I'll buy you sneakers after the game. These guys. [whistle blowing] [Jerry] And now, the ball is with Tondo Thunders! Passed to Nando. Will shoot for three! Wiggles and shoot! -[Sabrina] Yes! -[Jerry] Three for the Thunders! [Baste] Nice play! [crowd cheering] You're all stupid! [Gorio] It seems they changed their coach. Him? Yes, they changed. Their coach went out to buy sneakers for the two players. -[Baste] Three of them are gone. -[Gorio] They're close, huh? Okay? [Baste] I'll take care of everything. Don't worry! [upbeat music playing] [girls laughing] [girl] Stop it! [giggling] I'm ticklish! You're the best! [girl] Come on! That's nothing. -Hoping that Nando's team wins. -You're the best! [girl] He's one of the best players here, though. Hi, miss! -[Nando] Yuck! -Hi, girls! -Ew! -[man] That's enough. Let's go! Here you go. This is for you. Seriously! What do you want? -[Nando gasps] -[Sabrina giggles] [cheers] [clamoring] Hit him hard! [clamoring continues] You know what? It was also half-time last year when George Bustamante died. Also his brother and our referee Jonaks. It was also half-time when he was stabbed to death in 2015. Okay! Letter…. B! Soaking wet in the rain! Aegis! Ten. It's ten, my friends. Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! [man] I almost got it! Sorry! I thought I'm done! Why are you giving that look to Sabrina? That's you, right? Nothing. He's cute. -[crowd cheering] -[buzzer] [Jerry] And now, we are in the fourth quarter. Now, the Meanstars got the ball. Looking for a pass. And now it's with Mr. Beard! Let's see if he's going to make it. And he shoots! And Meanstars scores! And now, Nando is trying to penetrate inside to score. Let's see if he can shoot. -Nando was hit with a knee! -[whistle blowing] Nando! Ouch. [shrieks] [screams] Sorry! I thought you're from the other team. Ref! Ref! Ref! Didn't you see that? They're trying to kill my players! Next thing I know, they will bury them. That's nothing. [Jerry] Here's a montage of assault of Meanstars to Tondo Thunders! [dramatic music plays] What's happening to you? Uncle, I can't do this anymore! They play so dirty! We're already hurt! Don't mind them. They're just bluffing! I know you can do this! -[gasps] -[player] Mommy! It hurts so bad! Don't forget to pray, okay? The Tondo Thunders are still short players. Will they win? Dad. We are short players. Don't you think I should get in? What? -How will you get in? You are a woman. -I'll take care of it. Hey. And because the Thunders already lack players, they're letting anyone in. Substitution! [Jerry] And a woman has the ball. She's in her game phase! Crossing over! [Gorio] Get that ball in! [Gorio] Shoot! Shoot that ball! -[crowd cheering] -[shouting] [cheering] [triumphant music playing] [Sabrina] Give me the ball! Give me the ball! [suspenseful music plays] [player] Give me the ball! [shrieks] [Sabrina] Shoot the ball! [screaming] [Baste] Yes! [crowd cheering] [Baste] Guys! [player] Yes! We are the champions! [sustained music note playing] What happened? [Grandpa Junior] Nando! Sabrina! How are you two? Grandpa Junior! Now, I see your changes. You, Sabrina, you learned how to respect other people. And you, Nando, you learned how to trust other people. Grandpa Junior, can we do this fast because I ate too much a while ago. That's why… -You know… -Okay, okay. Let's do this fast. Hold hands. By the power vested in… Sorry, sorry. [silly sounds] [chicken clucks] [mysterious music plays] [laughs] -[gasps] -There's a hook! -[Sabrina laughs] -The hook came back! [laughing] I missed you! Let's do this fast. I'm also going to the toilet! Be good from now on! -Yes! Yes! -Promise! [laughing] [Nando] Yes! -[crowd cheering] -[feel-good music playing] -Congrats! -Girl, you did it! This is me. Really? Yup! And we're back! Is that you, Sab? It's Sabrina. [screaming] [Sabrina] I missed this! Kitty, I wanted to ask you something. Is it true? You said that… you have a crush on me? A little bit. [giggling] Alright, now that I am Nando, can I invite you to eat out? [giggles] Girl, wait! Why did she leave? It's because she's so excited! Thanks! Thanks. Friends? Friends. -[giggling] -[bright music playing] Hey, by the way. Not bad. -Of course! -[both laughing] [bright music playing] Ooh! You want? Tasty! Oh. I'll just help Nanny. [woman] Alright. [Sabrina] Nanny. -Hi, ma'am. -Hi, ma'am. Sorry. -Give. -I'll get your umbrella. -[Medel] Thank you. -Thank you! [Sabrina] Dad! [dad] Hello, my child. [Sabrina] Hello. Anyway, if that's the case, that easy. [man] We'll be cutting your husband's… [woman] Huh? Do we really need to cut it off? [man] She's head over heels with Nando. [man] She sent a flying kiss and Nando got it! [man] Not so… And he did that! -Here, Papi. -Come on. Lay up! -Wow! You're good! -That rocks! One more time! Wow! You're the best! [laughs] Happy birthday, munchkin! [squeals] Thank you! [Kirsten] Stupid! It's not my birthday! But wait… Is it your birthday? -Me? -Yes. It's not my birthday! Never mind. This may be for free. Alright. -Let's blow it. -Okay, okay. [Kirsten] One… two… [magical music playing] [energetic song playing]
