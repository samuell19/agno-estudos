I'm so glad you're safe. Are you all right? My body melted a bit in the fog, but the leaves are safe, so it's okay. You scared us. We were going to eat it, but it ate you instead. I should've been careful. You're looking like an airhead as usual. Glad you're okay. Hey! We're safe for now. Yes, the red fog should lift before long. So, what do we do with him? Yeah, I knew that was coming... What is he anyway? No idea, huh. I'm human! Seems like we can exterminate him in the red fog. So he's not a bug? H-Human... But Rinayo-chan was saved thanks to him. I live to protect you all. I'll exterminate anything that threatens you. I'll do it for Ryo and the others. But then again... he found the Red Bug before Sis and I did. He might know something about bugs. Let's let him live for now. We can exterminate him anytime. Can I ask you a favor then? The view up here is a bit too nice... My feet are dangling, and, well, it's a bit too high... Sis. There you are. Phew, I'm saved. That was the scariest thing today. Oh! Is this another Kemurikusa? Sis, let's talk about what to do next. Okay. Rina, keep an eye on him. But don't touch him, he's dangerous. Toss him in the fog if need be. Gotcha! We're done collecting the water. Are you sure you don't need any water yet? Yeah, I only used Midori, so I'm fine. Ai-chan's movement... So this really is the last of the water on this island. We need to use it sparingly. With this much water, we can go search again. What do you think? Before, we didn't have enough water, so we decided to stay here till the end. I thought about it, and I think you should make the decision. Whether we stay or go, you're the one who has to fight. I want to do what you want to do. I don't have any desires unlike you guys. So you choose, Sis. No, Rin. If I die, you'll be the eldest here. You need to get used to making decisions. I told you not to say stuff like that. Give it a thought. With this much water, we can wait for your decision for 5 days. Okay. I'll think about it. Oh yes, could you go pick some Kiiro? Okay, I'll check to see if there are any small Red Bugs left too. And now... Him, huh. He's not as threatening as a big bug for now. He's pretty weak too. Rina could probably beat him alone. What are you doing? But... But what? My body is feeling a bit strange. Strange? How so? I'm not sure if it's related, but my face feels hot depending on the distance and time. My heart beats faster. It feels bright and my vision gets blurry at times too. This has never happened before. Is it something serious? I don't think so, not for the moment. Do you think... it could be poison? You mean, the thing Ryoku-chan told us about? Yeah. Ryoku said that a poisonous Red Bug might appear some day. It kicks in a little while after you fight it. It remains even after the bug is dead. Does it hurt? It's not like that, at least for now. Riku would've known what this feeling was. When does it happen? When I'm close to him or when I see him. It also happens a bit when I talk about him. I might be just imagining it, but please be careful, Sis. I'll go pick some Kiiro now. Okay. I don't sense any big Red Bugs, but be careful. I will. Let me know if something happens. Of course. Um, where are we going? Shut up and walk. She still doesn't trust me. Am I going to be exterminated? This is it! This is what I saw when I fell. This is so amazing. So interesting. Midori's roots. Wow. It moves sometimes. Is it connected to Ritsu-san? Yes. So cool. It goes this way... Oh! It even goes between that small crack. Wow, so interesting. I see... And it goes this way, and then... Stop moving around. S-Sorry. Oh, it's so pretty. Is this Kemurikusa too? Yes, but we can't use it. Oh... You're right, it's hardly glowing. How is it different from Midori-san's? They're different colors. Come on, let's go. Can I take these back with me? Suit yourself. Yes! What's wrong? That... It's a bug, isn't it? The color is different. It won't attack. You're right. How strange. Thank you... Is that a Red Bug? And is that the green Kemurikusa? Amazing! You're right, the glow is totally different. The color, huh. I wonder if this can glow too. So interesting. He really doesn't die. Instead, it heals his cuts. He's neither Red Bug nor human. What is he? Um... Are you going to exterminate me? So, have you remembered anything? No, I don't remember a thing. Where did you come from, and how? I remembered the name, but... That better be true. Tell me everything you know right now. It's true. I swear! I can't remember what I did yesterday or what I was trying to do. Aren't you scared? Come to think of it, I'm not. I was too busy being scared of other things. Sorry. And maybe because it's fun with all these interesting things. And I'm glad I met you all, Rin-san. If I were alone here, I would've been killed by a Red Bug by now. Let's go. Sis, can you hear me? I'm at the Kiiro place. It's safe, so I'm going to collect some now. Okay, take your time. Why are you staring? Oh! I'm sorry. I'd never seen this before, so I'm curious. So this is what you came here for. Wow, this is great. It looks a bit like Midori-san. But is this one a bit withered? Is there anything I can do to help? No, just stay put. Okay. This place is full of mysterious things. This island is relatively quiet. Wait, there are other islands? That's so interesting. -Have you been to them? -I have. Wow. What's it like? Why'd you go there? There's a lot of Red Bugs. And the red fog. The six of us went to find water. Oh. Did you discover anything? Yes, thanks to everyone. About letters, how to defeat bugs, where the water is... Midori too. Wow, all important things. Yes, thanks to that, we've been able to survive. The situation is still bad. But I want my sisters to spend the rest of their time doing what they like. Of course, Sis loves Midori a bit too much though. Are you trying to figure out what our special powers are? Of course not! I'm just curious. Rin-san, Ritsu-san, and the Rina-sans with the same faces... Rinacchi, Rinaji, Rinayo, and Rinamu. They protect what I can't on my own. So the Rina-sans like to eat? Yes, not that I understand it. You don't? What my sisters like helps us to survive. They're a great help. You have a great relationship. And what do you like, Rin-san? Nothing. I only care about protecting my sisters. Protect? From the Red Bugs? Yes, and the red fog and lack of water. I have many concerns. I can't make the wrong decision again. Should we stay or leave the island for water? I see. But... once you clear all that, you can do what you like to do too. Impossible. It's a waste to even think about it. Yeah, it's not that simple, huh. Sorry. Oh, but! If there's anything I can do, let me know. I'll do anything. Scouting for bugs, cleaning... Oh, but only things that won't hurt or kill me, please. I don't understand him. He's so weak, yet he's oddly strong, so optimistic. And this feeling. What in the world is this? Rin-san, is that... We're going back. Wait, hold on... Rin, Wakaba-kun. Welcome back. Thank you. How was it? There was a small Red Bug, but that was it. Nothing strange either. Nothing except him. Yeah, he sure is strange. He's harmless for now... I think. Wakaba-kun, what's that you have on your waist? Huh? My waist? Whoa, what's happening? It's totally glowing. The Kemurikusa you just picked. When did it start glowing? It wasn't shining when you picked it? No. Is this safe? Is it okay to hold? It's rare for leaves other than Midori-chan's to change its glow. When did it start doing that? Did you do something? I don't know. Is it okay to hold this? It won't explode, will it? Rin, what color is that? Blue, I think. I've never used it before. Wow! When's the last time we found a new color? Huh? It stopped glowing. That's how it is, then. What are those used for? Watch. Kiiro leaves stay bright even after you pick them, so we use them for light. -For dark places. -And nighttime. That's right. I see. You don't know anything, do you? But that means I get to learn lots of new things. So it's really fun. Oh, fine then. Rina will teach you everything. I guess we must. Sis. Let's leave the island. Did you see something? No, nothing. But let's give it another try. Something might be different. And... I have a feeling we might discover something new. All right then, let's get to it. Rina-chans, time to start packing. -What for? -Not sure, but okay! Huh? What's going on? What are we doing? One, two. One, two. -Like this? -Perfect. Maybe this route would be safer. I'll decide the rest on site. We're ready to go. The water is tied down. The lid's closed tight too. Where should we head? We need to go to Island Two first. There's no more water all the way to Island Three. -Let's cross the bridge to Island Four. -Okay. If we make it safely to Island Four... Remember what Riku said about beyond Island Six? The lake. Lots of Red Bugs starting at Island Three. And there are no sure paths from Island Four. Besides, we don't even know if the paths up to there are still intact. Don't worry. Your decisions have always been right. Be confident. And if it still gets tough, we'll all do something about it. Thanks. Okay, let's go! All right! -Here it comes. -Here it is. Easy now, easy. All right! Incredible! Seems good. Yay! The tracks are fine down to the exit. There. Okay, let's go. Yeah. Off we go! -Yay! -Yay! Rinaji is smart and is on the lookout. Rinayo too. Rinayo too. I want to see too! Tracks, tracks. Oh wow! Moving such a huge object with us still on it. Midori-san is so strong. Hey. This is amazing, Rin-san. The view is so wonderful like this. -Stop moving around. -Yes. There's something I must say before we leave. Y-Yes? You mean, is it time to exterminate me? I don't trust you. Do anything funny, and I'll exterminate you. Don't forget that. But... you were what triggered this expedition. And thanks to you, Rinayo was saved. Thanks. N-nah, I didn't do anything. I don't even get what's going on. I'm just glad if it helped you out in some way. But why all of a sudden? Somebody usually dies when we leave the island. You'll probably die first, so I thought I'd tell you. What, seriously? It's that dangerous? We could die? But I want to see what it's like. No, but I don't want to die! I totally can't make up my mind! Let's go. Inside the dark my heartbeat echoes Long night will continue on Time to face the hell that surrounds you Before you crash and burn Within the fire Your soul will rise now Breathe in, breathe out Your blank gaze on the brink of life Step hard on the accelerator now Escape the tunnel and overtake that pain A shadow disappears into smoke Lost light will continue on tomorrow Someday our world will change Inside a fantasy Remember, remember I will mercilessly break your dream and steal it away, with these hands Until this body breaks Beyond the limit We'll never surrender Endless agony Finding my life in the KEMURIKUSA
