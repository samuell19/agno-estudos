DIFFERENT FROMYOU AND ME The incidents and characters portrayed in this film are entirely fictitious. Any similarity with actual persons or incidents is purely coincidental. We are trying the criminal case against Christa Teichmann, housewife. Please be seated. The following witnesses are summoned: Dr Boris Winkler, antique dealer. Please step forward. And remove your glasses. Then the witness Manfred Glatz, upper sixth-form student. - Present. Stay where you are. And his mother, Emilie Glatz, widow of the late Mr Glatz. The witness Gerda B?ttcher, currently live-in lady's help at the Teichmann family home. The bank manager Werner Teichmann. - Yes. Mr Teichmann is the husband of the defendant. And then Klaus Teichmann, upper sixth-form student and son of the defendant. - Present. You will be called as witnesses in the trial of Mrs Teichmann for aggravated procuration. Please leave the courtroom for now. You will be called as witnesses later. I move for the exclusion of the public on grounds of danger to public morals. Counsel, are you agreed? The motion is granted. Constable, please clear the courtroom. What nonsense! Come on. This is just too stupid. Do relatives count as 'the public' too? - Of course, now get a move on. They're treating us like little kids. CLOSED TO THE PUBLlC. Mrs Christa Teichmann! - Stand up. The public prosecutor charges you with aiding and abetting sexual offences by providing or procuring opportunities, and under aggravating circumstances because your relationship with the person being procured was that of mother to child. This is an offence under ?? 180 and 181 of the Penal Code. The main proceedings are now being instituted against you here before the central criminal court. Would you like to answer this charge? Yes. - Yes... In chronological terms, and to help us understand what happened later, the daywhen your son Klaus first met Dr Boris Winkler seems to be important. What did your son tell you about this encounter? Tell us about it, Mrs Teichmann. - Well... It was at the end of March. I don't rememberthe exact date. Klaus told me later that school was over, the kids were rushing out of the gates, he was heading for his motor scooter, and just at that moment, Dr Winkler came up and spoke to him. Hello, Klaus Teichmann! - Yes? Hello, I'm Boris! - Boris? Didn't Manfred mention Boris? - You're Dr Boris Winkler? He's told me a lot about you. - I recognised you right away. He described you... very well. Manfred's waiting for you. - I can't, it's my mother's birthday. But I promised that you'd go to him right away. All right, perhaps I'll make it. - Come along, I'll drive you there. Thanks, DrWinkler, but I've got my scooter here. Don't call me DrWinkler. Myfriends' friends are myfriends. My name's Boris. Thank you... Boris. Manfred told me about your pictures. I'd like to see them. Would you like to come to my house? When Manfred's better again we'll come round. You're welcome to come on your own. Fine... Boris! Is Klaus home yet? - No, just Uncle Max, Mr Teichmann. Oh, you're here already! - The birthday roast's enticed him home. Max onlythinks of food, never of the birthday girl. Where's the lad? - I'll take a look, Werner. If he can't even make it to your birthday on time... - OK, OK... Oh, you've done it already! Klaus isn't there yet. - I see. Well, I can stick it in the oven again. -Yes, you do that, Gerda. I'll saythe roast isn't readyyet. I don't want him scolding the lad today of all days. "The southerlywind gently brushes the age-old rocks' wrinkled skin and the curls of the woods cascade down the slope darkly into the valley." "The Caress of the Night." "Curls of the woods..." that sounds like music. I had to show you. Printed in the paper for the first time! That doesn't happen every day! I've got to go. It's my mum's birthday. What do you think of Boris? Did he recognise you straight away? - Of course. Do you like him? Yes, he's... there's something about him. Did he ask you round? - I'll go when you're back on yourfeet. He sawyour picture. Fold it up. He thinks you're talented. He wants to see more. Well it's his profession too. He'll get you into the paper as well. - He got your poem...? - Yes! He's got friends everywhere. In every editorial office. In all circles. You know, sis, this modern rubbish hardly means a thing to me. Is that really supposed to be a plane? It says so there. - It's a good thing that it does. I wouldn't fly in it, it's bound to crash. Oh, you're a Philistine, Max. The lad spent five nights painting that. It's touching. Yes, but you don't knowwhat it is, whatever angle you look at it from. Everyone says he's very gifted. - I wish he was a bit more normal. We're waiting for our gifted son again. - You're ungrateful, Werner. Klaus is a star pupil. He certainly is gifted. You ought to be satisfied. But he isn't. He wants the boy to be just like him. And what will he be then? A bank manager? Is that bad? - Not bad, but not much either. Our Klaus will be more than that. - Let's hope so. My son's lazy, impudent, gluttonous and has to repeat every other year. And he's unpunctual too. And yet, no-one's ever called him gifted. But he's normal What's the record called? - It doesn't have a name. Boris had it recorded. Great... It sounds just great. It sounds like my pictures. If my father heard it in my room, he'd lock me in. This is the best part. Tremendous. Gerda! Yes? - I won't wait any longer for lunch. All right, we'll serve it. That little doll wouldn't be allowed round at ours. -Why not? Our son chases after anything in a skirt. If only ours would! Do you reckon he's not interested in girls yet? You don't know lads today! They start earlier than we did. He's not interested in girls, don't you understand? Just those awkward, inhibited boys he always knocks around with. Oh, I see.... It just makes me sick at home. I don't think my father was ever young. He doesn't understand me at all. If my mother wasn't there I'd clear off. Look after yourself. For all male and female homosexuals, Magnus Hirschfeld coined the term: "The Third Sex..." Contrary to the widely-held view that homosexuality is innate, the opinion is now gaining ground that homosexuality results from a reversal in the direction of sexual urges in early adolescence. Well, since when have we eaten at three? Is it three already? What's the atmosphere like? - Don't ask. Is the manager still in the building? - He's waiting for you. Oh, great. So let's party. You must have been riding fast. Just look at you! Not appropriate, eh? - No. Don't you think you're overdoing it with Manfred? Don't you start now. The manager's enough for me. Klaus, it's your father you're talking about. Sorry, Mum. I forget that sometimes. Couldn't you do without Manfred at least for today? He's sick, dearest, I had to go. Your father says you're sick too. But I'm in the best of health. I've got an 'A' in PE. Infected by him. - By Manfred? What makes you think that? Your father had the idea. - I don't understand. So let him explain it to you. He's waiting for you. Klaus is sick? I fear for you. - You simply don't understand me. What's there to understand? We had friends, too, but not like you two. I can't talk to you about it. You just think there's no money in pictures, music and poems. For you, life is a bank statement. We're worlds apart. That bank statement might have made it possible for you to go to grammar school, for us to have a house, for you to understand that culture you drivel on about. See, there we go again. Always on about money and the house. That's reality, son... Oh, so pictures, music and poetry aren't reality? From your mother you've inherited a dangerous inability to perceive reality. You can come a cropper because of it. And Manfred is encouraging it. That's why you'll stop seeing him. Manfred is and will stay my friend. We'll see about that. Uncle Max said that Peter and Renate have often invited you to their dances. Is that true? - Yes. - But you've never gone. - No. Tomorrow they're holding a party by the lake. You're going to go. Is that an order? - Please yourself. At any event, you'll be there. All right, I'll go. Here comes the sick poet! - Oh, what a gay day! Feeling better again, darling? - Hans! Manfred, you write poems, don't you? - Let me go! But be nice to me, my precious... - Stop it! Leave him alone! I'd like you to write a love poem for me. But my inclinations are quite different from yours! - Let him go! Hans wants a poem, too! - Yes, I'll lift you... - Let me go! It's none of your business! Hello! Gentlemen! May I request you to suspend your hostilities for a moment? I don't know, Teichmann, are we studying the Greek language or Graeco-Roman wrestling? Whatever it is, it's Greek, Sir. As star pupil you should convince with intellectual power, should you not? Sometimes it takes a punch to convince. That's true. Unfortunately. Is this a private difference of opinion? Very private. - All right then. Go out and wash. Look at the state of you! Now let us turn to our exercises. We'll write a test... That's enough noise, gentlemen. We shall open our xenophon, page 27, and translate sections 17 to 18 into our beloved mothertongue. Thanks. - He won't botheryou again. I'll read my new novellato you this evening. When can you come round? I can't today. I've got to go to that stupid dance bythe lake. That's awful. -We shall work in silence, gentlemen! I'll just stayfor an hour, then I'll come round to yours. Well, I never! You can dance! English waltzes are deadly boring. I'm into rock 'n' roll. You're tipsy. Now I'm amazed. Everyone says you don't like girls! Who? Tell me, or else you're going into the water. What are you getting so worked up about? Come over here. I want to know who said it. - But not here. Come on. Stop it! I want to know who said that about me! Everyone! Father, Peter, just everyone. - Well, I'll be blowed! Isn't it true then? - Yes, it's true. When I see that silly posturing, those bitches, this stupid flirting around in my class... It makes me puke. So are cousins bitches as well? Little bitches... Stop that, or else I'll shake you down from the tree. Hey, rock 'n' roll! Or don't you want to dance with a bitch? - If I have to. I could kill her. Bloody women. Mr Mertens! - Yes. What's up? Oh, you've been invited, too? Then come in. It's sparkling... plenty of nice young girls in there. Here's something to drink. - I'd rather not come in. I have to see Klaus Teichmann urgently. It's about school work. - I see. Couldn't you tell him? -Why not come with me? Oh, I'll never get away again. - All right, don't then. So what's your name? - Manfred Glatz! Oh, you're Manfred Glatz! That's very interesting. Right, just wait there. He'll be over in a minute. Very interesting... Ten. You're not saying anything. - I'm reading... You're not reading at all! You haven't turned the page for an hour. What are you thinking about then? Oh, this and that. What? Tell me! Look... - Yes? Is that all? Werner... what do you understand by "The Third Sex"? So you've read it? So have you. Of course. To inform myself about it. Yes, quite. Right, let's go to bed! You think too much. - Won't you wait until he's back? What if he gets back at five in the morning? Then you'll be cursing, Werner. - If he dances with the girls I won't. Anyway, tomorrow's Sunday. Come on. I'll wait for a bit. Maybe he'll be hungrywhen he comes in. Do you think he'll get nothing to eat at your brother's? Goodnight. - Goodnight, Werner. Don't pull aface like that. I'm here, aren't l? What's your novella called? "The Rainbow". Don't talk so loudly. My mother's sleeping. You're looking at me as if I were a criminal. There are loud and silent crimes. A look can be enough. Don't just drop hints. What are you accusing me of? You knew I wanted to read my novella to you. I've waited two hours for you. I saw... - What did you see? Tell me! I saw how you grabbed her legs. And the way you danced with her. Can't you imagine how I'm feeling? Aren't I allowed to dance? - Not with her, not like that. Do we want to talk about Renate, or do you want to read your novella to me? Will you go with me to Boris's place tomorrow? - Sunday evening? Please, Klaus, do come. Are you going to let me down again? My father won't let me go. I've promised Boris. I want to read you the novella I'll be giving him tomorrow. You're the first to hear it. And now you're not coming. Okay, I'll manage it somehow. Thanks, Klaus. Now let's hear "The Rainbow". - "The Rainbow. In loud, almost painful colours, the rainbow was reflected in the yellow, clayey puddles of the lowlands. It was so dark, and it was as if the moon were reflected. A wind got up and blew away the light of its reflection..." Klaus! Haven't you got a key? - No, I forgot it again... Are you only just back from the dance? - No... oh... yes, of course... Renate called... - When? Around twelve... - What did she want? Don't know. She said you just ran off. She wanted to talk to you... Oh, what a cow! Father answered, of course! No, I did. Your parents had already gone to bed. You were with Manfred, weren't you? You won't tell the old man, will you? You're a treasure! Go back to sleep. Don't exaggerate like that! - So he should be allowed to lie? No, but you can overdo it. - No tea for me, I can't sleep anyway. We lied to our parents too, now and again. - But not so outrageously! I didn't lie to my father with such cunning. But you did lie! - Well, every boy lies. Who's being brought up here? Me or my son? You get brought up for as long as you live, Werner. I could kick myself, I shouldn't have told you. But Renate was so despairing, the way he went off with him in the middle of the party... - Why didn't you turn him away? I didn't imagine he'd run off with Manfred! He'll find his way. All young people go through phases where they don't know exactly... Where he belongs? I didn't have that phase. Your father certainly had an easier time with you. - Oh yes, he did! Is that an accusation? Your son's so taken with Manfred. He's a slave to him. I've made enquiries about this Manfred Glatz. The boy is proven to have a homosexual disposition. You don't like hearing that word, but it's got to be said. All the healthy lads reject Manfred, only our Klaus shares his life with him. Whatever that pasty-face says is a revelation. Pasty-face? - That's what he looks like. Pasty-face! That's good! Whatever I say is nonsense. It's 'You don't understand, father'. You're oversimplifying it, Christa. Just because I'm not shouting? I'd rather do something! -What am I supposed to do? Something that cures him. - Cures him... It says so in the encyclopaedia. You can cure it in adolescence. I'll cure him all right, but not with your depth psychology and your disastrous understanding for... - For what? I don't want to hurt you, Christa. I've locked him in. - You've locked him in? I've locked him in his room because he said that he had to go to see his friend Manfred this evening. By doing that you'll achieve the opposite. The boy's too sensitive. Oh, give it a rest! I'll use whatever means I think are right to prevent him from seeing Manfred. You should have started doing that earlier. - But I didn't know earlier. And now he should tell me where he was all night. Please, Werner... don't create a scene this evening! Now there'll be a row. Here we are waiting for a 'row' upstairs, and then there's no row. You give the impression that you're not happily married. Oh, Werner's the best person in the world. But there's a little 'but' to follow, am I right? - He's coming down again. Where are you going? - Your son's gone. He's your son as well. When you're angry he's always my son. I thought you'd locked him in. - Criminals use the window. And you say he's not a proper boy. My son isn't a criminal! I forbid you to talk like that! Mywife shouts at me! My brother-in-law laughs at me! My son runs away! A great family! Don't you know where Klaus is? - Don't shout at her as well! He's gone to Manfred's. Did he tell you that? I'm thinking it too! He climbed out of the window, and was just hanging there... -You saw it? Yes, I came along. - Did you help him? Am I supposed to let him fall? And you're not saying aword? So when was that? It wasn't long ago... -What were you thinking of? I was thinking that I wouldn't let myself be locked in either! A house revolt! I'm going to Manfred's! - I'm coming too. You're fartoo worked up. Bythe way, theywanted to visit a DrWinkler. - So who's he? Klaus says he's involved in art. - What kind of art? He's probably another shady character. - Klaus says he can learn a lot from him. Lots of lads are there. They talk about art, and about... I dunno... There you are then! He already moves in those circles that produce the criminals! Don't talk such nonsense. Wasn't it in the paper? Some 19-year-old killed a woman just to steal 18 marks 50. He hit her with a spanner. And he was from homosexual circles. - Yes, I read it too. Don't turn our boy into a murderer! - What? Me? This is getting too crazy for me. I'll come with you to Manfred's to find out where Winkler lives. You're driving yourselves crazy! Christa, I'm just nervous. - I know. You act as if our child were lost. He's the best at school. He's going to get somewhere in life. Does he have to be a paragon? - No, but there's a limit to everything. Come on, Max, I've got to know who this Dr Winkler is. See this here? This is where the music comes out. It's the loudspeaker. I've never seen an instrument like that before. You'll get to see even more surprising things here. Is it electronic music? - Yes. Concrete music. This is Klaus. Klaus is a verytalented painter. We'll see some of his work this evening. Concrete music? I don't understand that. The French coined the term 'musique concr?te' to say that what we call music on the basis of harmonic theory has been converted into tones of the present, everyday life. Did you understand that? - Well, yes, but... Manfred. Wow! Sophisticated! Mrs Glatz, I really don't understand why you won't give us Dr Winkler's address. I don't want to cause any problems for Dr Winkler. I get the impression that you... That I want to cause him trouble? - Yes. I've no reason to do that. I want to know where my son is and what kind of man Dr Winkler is. He's a very good person, if that's any reassurance, a very fine person. He's done a lot for Manfred. He gets his poems printed, maybe even his novellas, and he's also going to pay for his studies. Don't you think this gentleman's doing a bit too much? -Why? I'm awidow. I can't afford that. With my meagre pension I can't afford to send my son to college. Mr Teichmann, I knowthat DrWinkler likes Manfred. And I knowthat you've stopped your son from seeing my boy. So you can guess whom I prefer. - I've nothing against your son at all. But I have reasons... - I'm not interested. I know, but I am interested! I'd like to know what my son's getting into. I'd like you to go. I don't feel like continuing this conversation. OK then, let's go. We can get DrWinkler's address from the police. The bloke's bound to be registered somewhere. Come on, Max! Goodbye. Will he really go to the police? If you don't give us his address, we'll have no other alternative. My husband was a dancer at the State Opera in Dresden. The boy has got a certain manner. I've come to terms with it. - But you shouldn't, Mrs Glatz. Aren't you afraid that you'll neglect your maternal duties? Forgive me for interfering, but you've spun yourself ayarn about good, nice DrWinkler. Believe me, those kind of people aren't like that, and if you don't intervene in good time you might regret it bitterly. Where did you see that? - What do you mean? You must have seen it with your mind's eye. I didn't. It's influenced by Picasso, and maybe Kandinsky. You see, but Picasso and Kandinsky... each of them painted with his own imagination. And your pictures won't really be yours until Klaus Teichmann paints what Klaus Teichmann himself imagines. Yes... Yes, you're right. You're the first person to tell me that. May I say, I'm very happy! - Of course you may. In fact, that's the nicest thing you can say to me, Klaus. You know... I've got a feeling we've known each other for a very long time. I feel so strange at home... We'd like to see DrWinkler. - What does it concern? My son, Klaus Teichmann, is supposed to be at a gathering here. There's no gathering. DrWinkler's not at home. But we can hear music. - I listen to the radio when I'm alone. Where can we find DrWinkler? DrWinkler doesn't tell me where he's going. Might he be in the 'Pokal'? You may search for him there. Or can I give him a message? Thank you so much foryour kind permission to look for DrWinkler. Good evening, gentlemen! Stop playing for a moment, Achim. You knowthe Greeks had the agora, the discussion at the marketplace, and afterthat single combat in the gymnasium. Mind and body, one feeding the other, as Plato said. Today, though, in the new Greek of our conquerors, it's called 'catch as catch can'. The fighters enter the arena. The first round: Heinz and G?nther. Why aren't you watching? They're good today. G?nther's better, even though Heinz is stronger. It's said you fought well on Manfred's behalf at school. Manfred told you? I'd like to have seen it. Your fight in the classroom. You wouldn't have seen much. - Listen, don't you want to take boxing lessons here? I've a very good teacher. Me? - Why not? You've got the physique for it. Klaus's father was at the door. - And? Dr Winkler isn't at home. Being just a weak woman, I'm looking for a strong man. I look at the gentlemen from this perspective alone... Since I don't like being alone... - Is that a woman or a man? A man! - Oh, a female impersonator. That's another word for it. But she sings quite nicely. - He. It's a 'he' singing. His name interests me not, ifhejust makes me happy. It's enough to frighten you. - He's not doing you any harm. What do you think of that? Love is a mysterious thing, it has a special magic power. You dream of a woman, the woman's suddenly here, and she confesses to you... But the ones at the next table, they're... - Men as well. That's what it says in their passports. - I don't believe it! Hello, Fritz! - What? Yes? Good God! Do you know her? - Him! You sent for me, gentlemen? - Oh, indeed, Ren?, we wanted to ask if we could find Dr Boris Winkler here. You're friends of Boris's! That puts awhole new complexion on the matter. Unfortunately, we haven't seen Boris for 14 days. Not being unfaithful, is he? Thank you. What do you think of Fifi? Oh yes, yes... She's been working in Paris. - My word, Paris? We only have international numbers. We know no borders. - Ren?! Excuse me, please. - Being just a weak woman, Don't make such a wretched face. Here, you have to know how to enjoy yourself. Laugh a little! I might have laughed about it, but when I think that Klaus has got into this kind of company, I've nothing to laugh about. - They don't need to hear it. You pay for me! I'm off! Since I don't like being alone, my heart searches night and day for the man I'm dreaming of. He may not be a big shot, his name interests me not, if he just makes me happy. Terrible! - Oh, yes indeed. Shall we have another? - Yes. Landlord! Doubles. That all that exists! It's incredible. The world, my dear Werner, is full of shadows! But the shadows are part of nature, too. That's when a Stein-Pils cure will get you back on your feet. What's that? Steinh?ger, Pilsener... Stein-Pils cure. Now I see what kind of a world it is that Klaus has got himself into. He can't go do the dogs like that! I didn't see a dog. You're drunk, Max. -Yes, but at least I'm not pulling aface like you are. Christa said we should go to the psychologist Schmidt, but I don't know. Yes! Let's go over, let's go over to Schmidt's... What prompted you to visit me? We read your articles about youth psychology being obliged to develop an interest in the subject. My wife had the idea, so I called you. Personally, to be honest, I don't think much of depth psychology. Even so, I wish parents would take this step more often. These things are fairly easy to correct in the early stages. Later, it develops into complexes. From what you say, this is a delay in normal development. The boy's still at the first stage of danger. See, Werner, it's not so bad. You've always run your boy down. I haven't. I just feared for him. And I still have those fears. I can't talk to him. It's as though we're speaking different languages. And you are, Mr Teichmann: the languages of different generations. This opposition from your son is a part of development. This is when the mother can do more than the father. I've nothing against that. I was brought up by my father, but... You're sure to have been a perfectly normal boy. I most certainly was! - Yes, he was. Without crises like that. So what do we do? We don't know much about these things. He must be drawn out of these circles that he's fallen into. It begins with intellectual interests that can gradually lead to serious entanglements. These people often refer to ancient times, to platonic pederasty. Other parents must have come to you with similar cases. Oh, yes. It's not as rare as people think. Some parents come to me with fears about their 13-year-old sons, but I can reassure them. Intense friendships are quite normal in puberyt. -Yeah, at 13 I thought girls were silly, but the lad is nearly 18. Yes, at that age it's more dangerous. Just one momentary occurrence could see the boy lost to normal life. Doesn't he look at girls at all? - That's the point! How can you be so sure? A boy's shy in front of his parents. So why are we here, Christa? Why bother if we can't face the truth? You should leave your son's guidance to your wife. When young people awaken in the erotic sense, they start to break away from their previous, comradely friendships and turn towards love, encounters with one individual being, Poets call it togetherness. At this stage you've got to be careful. If he's normal, you'll slow him down if he's too forward with girls too early. But in your son's case, I'd almost advise you to encourage him and loosen the reins a little. This will be the best way to give nature a helping hand. In a way, this advice is homeopathic. I hope you've understood it properly. I know what I'm doing, Christa. Deterrence is the best way. What's your big idea? - I'll take him to the bar I went to with your brother. I'll show him where the path he's on will lead him. I'll show him everything until he's disgusted with himself. No you won't. I've got some say in this too. I'll never agree to that. Why are you making him so conscious of it? In the end he'll despise us. But he's a lad. And to work for a man, it must penetrate the consciousness. That's what you women lack. You radiate an uncertainty that's just ridiculous. You radiate a certainty that's scary. I'm amazed how little you know your son. - Well, if you know him so well, and if the psychologist thinks that you know everything better, then it's your responsibility. I'm at my wits' end. I've got to go to the bank. I've got a little second job, after all. Goodbye. Hello! - Hello! You seem to be doing fine! - Can't complain. Where's Klaus? - He's working. He's always working. Do you think he's nice? Of course, very. But not as nice as Uncle Max's Peter? Peter? He's terribly cheeky... he's always touching me. His father too, incidentally. And then he says 'little doll'. Don't you like that? - It's awful, blokes who are always pawing at you! Most of them do that. Thank God there are some who don't. Klaus doesn't do it. - No. Our Klaus is a... a real gentleman. Why are you asking me these questions? - I'm interested, Gerda. Did my son give you the pictures as a gift? No, they're on sale. Like everything else here. I'm an art and antiques dealer, in case you didn't know. My son can't sell pictures without informing his father. They haven't been sold yet, sir. I don't want this kind of encouragement for my son. I want you to break off all contact with him. - I don't force him to come here. You are, as they say, the parent or guardian. Forbid him to come here. I think you sense that I have little influence over Klaus at present. There are times when a son goes against his father. Do you smoke? - No, thanks. Are you very fond of him? - Oh, you're pulling my leg! No, I'd like to know. Yes, so now you know. He's listening. Hey, little washerwoman! -Where are you off to? I thought you were working. -Yes, with Manfred. Do you have to? - Yes. He can't understand his maths. 'Bye, you two! I'll be back soon. Oh, I could put this guy Manfred through his paces! The cause may be Manfred Glatz, but it's you who's encouraging the alienation between me and my son. You see, these young people come to me because they find something here that their fathers can't give them: conversation, understanding, a certain intellectual excitement, artistic teaching, and often preparation for their careers. I'll decide who teaches my son. Would it really be better if he hung around on dance floors between fruit machines and whores? Oh, come on, between these extremes there's a normal world of normal people, the one I grew up in and still inhabit. Indeed, the world of... Oh, never mind. Go ahead and say it: the world of the petit bourgeois. If you say so yourself. At any rate it's a world where a modern, intellectually alert person suffocates. As if anyone would suffocate in a world where well over 99% of all people live! So now you know my point of view. If Klaus wants to come to my house, he'll always be welcome. So! Right then, I have other means. Is that a threat? - It's self-defence when I have to resort to the law. You want to go to the police? What crime have I committed? That remains to be seen. Get out of my house now. - With the greatest pleasure, sir. Klaus? But he's a real boy. You've nothing to fear there. No reason to get upset. But Christa Teichmann! I've never seen you like this before, and I've known you for so long. I want advice, doctor. Your love for your boy will be your best adviser. I fear that my love isn't advising me properly. What is a mother supposed to do in a case like this? That depends on the individual case. It can be a crisis, it can also be fate. How old is Klaus now? - Eighteen. I could recommend psychotherapyfor him, but whether it'll be successful... How can you be so certain that he's in danger? Well, he's got a school friend, and he took him to an art dealer who we've found out is... - I understand. What kind of man is that? How old is he? Well... perhaps 50. That's very dangerous for ayoung man. There's only one antidote: love. The real love of awoman. Only real love can help. Ah, the gown. Oh, I don't really need it. Daddy's only going on a business trip. - Perhaps you'll go to the theatre... Daddy never goes to the theatre. You know what he's like. Gerda... Oh, the bracelet! If it weren't for Klaus I'd never even have gone to the theatre here. It's beautiful. - I'm not taking the bracelet with me. It's easy to lose those things on trips. It used to be my mother's. It's my favourite piece of jewellery. It's intended for my daughter-in-law. - lt'll be yours for a long time then. I'll write down everything that you take with you. I fear for Klaus! - Oh, I'll keep an eye on him! Sometimes I think that men today, the young men especially, are so strange: some are so rough and others are so clumsy, almost cowardly. And that's really more our fault. Women's fault, don't you think so? Yeah, could be. I'm sure women are to blame for a lot of these things. Sometimes a woman isn't aware of the power she holds overthe man she's fond of. Also over... - Klaus? Of course, also over Klaus. When a woman's really fond of someone, she can say a lot, and perhaps forget a few things too. And maybe bite the bullet, too. How long will your parents be away? - At least eight days. I could live at yours. That would be terrific. Why not? I can do as I please. You can paint, I could write. We could work on our 'A' levels. Okay, bring your things round this evening. I don't know what you mean by that. - Yes you do. But you can't imagine that a motherthinks like that. You don't want to believe that I mean it like that. My heart's pounding. - Mine too. But you love him, don't you? And the one you loved in Pomerania, you've forgotten him? He's married. That's over. So now you know. What am I supposed to say? - Nothing. You can forget what I said... if you want. There's the car. Didn't my husband come with you? - No, madam, he's still busy. But he'll be ready for the big trip by the time we reach the office. You made it then. I want to say goodbye. Isn't Dad there? - I'm picking him up at the office now. So have a good trip, dearest. Don't let anyone accost you, be good, go to bed early and give Dad my regards. You look so worried. You won't be at Manfred's or that Boris's every evening, will you? Not every evening. - Promise me. Don't worry. I must think of my 'A' levels, after all. Yes, you must. - We'll be fine. Oh, my boy. Right, goodbye you two. - Goodbye. Well, now we're on our own. Werner Teichmann? What do you know about him? I've got his personal details. Just a moment, please. Branch manager of the merchant bank in Albrechtstra?e, good family, well-ordered family life, no criminal record, 49 years old. On grounds of the homosexual seduction of young people. Dr Boris Winkler? The name rings a bell. The name came to light when the youth Petersen was arrested, sir. We didn't question him at that time, though. Then let the inquiries begin. We'll look into the case. Would Lord Muck like anything else? - No, Lord Muck sends his thanks. Is that supposed to beyou? But it doesn't look like you at all. - Likeness isn't important. What is then? - The being, the inner self. I wouldn't like to be drawn byyou. -Why not? It's bound to be something frightful... I don't think so. I'd only drawyour eyes. And your mouth. Open up. Don't laugh so soppily. Your eyes light up yourwhole face. Who can that be? - Maybe Manfred, I told him... What did you tell him? - That he can work and stay at ours. He's supposed to live here? Are you crazy? The whole time? Can't I invite a friend to come here? What did you promise your mother? Are you off your head? I was already thinking there was no-one at home. Who are you? - Manfred Glatz. Klaus invited me. I don't know anything about that. - Well, that's strange. Can't I speak to him? - That's not possible. But I can't go home again with all my things. I'm afraid you've got to. Good night! Where are you going? - To my room. Will you put the light out? Can I come in for a moment? - Just a minute. I'm sure you're angry because I threw Manfred out! Did you feel sorry for him? -Yes, a bit. In that case you could have asked him in. -Yes, I could have done. But you didn't want to? No. There you are! Is that all you wanted to tell me? I wanted to draw you. I tried it out of my head, but I can't. Like this? - That doesn't matter. I wanted to draw your head. So that doesn't matter? Okay, if it doesn't matter... Hey, give me my slippers. It's cold here. I can do that myself. You've got a pretty foot. Oh, please! Do you want to draw it? - The foot? No. Well? What's up, master painter? Sit yourself down. Put them on yourself. Does my face look good in this light? Hey, your dressing gown. Turn the music off. It's Chopin. - Nonsense. Turn it off anyway. Hey, you can really draw. Have I got such big eyes? Why are you looking at me like that? Because I'm drawing you. And that's really how you look at someone? What? Sit down. Should I get changed? - If you want. What are you wearing underneath? Nothing. I see... I can't draw you like that. Right, I'll put something on. Throw me mythings over. I've only got my stockings here. You believe, like the others,... that l... What am I supposed to believe? Why did Manfred have to go? - Oh, listen... You all say I'm not a man, don't you? - I've never said that. But Renate, Father, Uncle Max. And who else? I think you'll have to go. And what if I don't? Then I'll go. You won't get past me. Oh, let me get to the door. -You're welcome to try. Put the music on. - All right. But you won't get past. You've been avoiding me all day. - Oh, don't be daft! We'll have to talk about yesterday evening. What is there to talk about? - You invite me over, and this silly cow with the staring eyes throws me out. Listen, Gerda isn't a cow, right? You can walk the rest of the way. - You're not driving me home? Are you angry because I called her a cow? I've no time for that rubbish right now. Are you coming to Boris's this evening? Are you crazy? - Got it in one. What's for dinner? - It's not ready yet. - Why not? Turn the music off! - Oh, don't grumble. I'm glad you're happy. You mother's sure to be happy, too. Not if she knew the reasons. Mothers don't like reasons like that. Have you ever loved another man? You're not supposed to ask questions like that, Klaus. Have you ever experienced something like yesterday? You shouldn't ask a woman questions like that. But listen, we belong together now. - But I'm not your other half. Of course you are. I'm never going to leave you. Someone said that before. And how long did that last? A month. So you have loved a man before? How can one... Can you forget that? You're laughing at me. No. You'll find out about the eternities of love when you've forgotten about me. How can you say something like that? I'll neverforget you. Get your 'A' levels first. Wait a minute. There's something wrong. Hold the bike tight, with both hands. Are you crazy? - Right, now it's fixed. In front of the house! Do you want everyone to know? As far as I'm concerned, they can. - Not if I can help it. Steady on, I have to close the gate. Hey, look out! Look out, or else we'll hit a tree! - Are you frightened? - Yes. This wouldn't be a good time to die. Gerda? - She's a kind of lady's help. An older woman? - No, she's 20. How long has she been there for? She's a refugee without relatives. Quite a common person. And Klaus suddenly fell in love with her? Interesting. How did that happen? - I think she softened him up. His parents are away. Give the electronics a rest! So they left the lad alone with the girl? Strange... That's their intention. Did you know that banker reported me to the police? Teichmann? That bastard! I know what you're getting at lnspector. But what do you want from me? Dr Boris Winkler arranged piano lessons for me because he wants me to play the electronic organ at his house. Do you know what an electronic organ is? - No. You see, as a result of a certain electric stimulant... Do you know what a stimulant is? - Yes, I know. Through this stimulant, the membranes in the loudspeaker are made to vibrate. It's done through wires... I don't want visual instruction about your strange vibrating instrument. How am I supposed to understand that? Why do you always laugh like that? It's just the kind of face I've got. You see, lnspector, I'm quite happy to make a statement. We're going to get on famously. I think so, too. Has Dr Boris Winkler made any unambiguous approaches to you? I'm not aware of any ambiguity. Has he ever kissed you or touched you indecently? Or did you see him kissing other boys? - Kissed, kissed... wait... Kissed, yes. - And? On the forehead, I think. It's easy to forget about that kind of thing. Do you want to pull my leg? - Not your leg, no. And you saw nothing else to indicate that... er... That all-male orchids are held in Dr Winkler's house? They're called orgies. - But we call them orchids. I've never seen anything. Would you declare that on oath? - Of course. I'll take any oath. G?nther and Heinz have been questioned. Soon it'll be yourturn, and who knows who else. - Do theythink we'll say anything? Teichmann should get to know me. Always upstanding! Always in the right! That's what this little Podsnap thinks. And we're scum. It's called procuration! He'll get a nice reception when he comes home, that banker. So how often were you at Manfred's? If you really want to know, dearest, I wasn't there once. See, things aren't how you thought they were. And why not? Never gave it a moment's thought, did you? Well, you appear to know! - I do know. Here. When you've read this, you'll know, too. Charge? What are you trying to say? Just that I was subpoenaed, and that l... - Lots of people were subpoenaed. I didn't say anything against you. - Nobody said anything. Nothing for them to tell, was there? - Well, they really had me in a dilemma. But I thought, Boris will see me right after what I'm doing for him. And what did you think? What do you mean? - How much do you want for not telling the police anything? Well, I do need a bit of money. - How much? The last instalment on my motorbike, or else they'll take it back. If I don't pay on time... - I asked how much. The last one's three hundred. Maurice! That's no business for the police. And people shouldn't be hounded either. Would you like to be hounded? - I've done nothing wrong. Never in your life? - No. Withdraw it. - I'm not making afool of myself. The complaint is being pursued. A lot of parents are going to be grateful to me for that. Close the electronic organ and put the key on top of it. Here are your three hundred marks. Maurice, you saw him blackmailing me. I didn't give him the money out of fear. I just can't afford to have my name in the papers for something like this. You know the sentence for blackmail. So I'll keep quiet too. Get out! - Are you crazy? - Get out! Shame on you! Don't you touch me! Hey, you're tearing all my clothes! Wait, you bastard, I'll get you for this! Oh dear, oh dear, he made a right fuss. How old was Carlos? - 18. He wasn't even 16. I thought he was 18. - 16. Achim just told me. And the way he told me... - Now I'm sorry I roughed him up. So far only Achim knows. But tomorrow the others will knowtoo. Will they all come for money? - That's the least of my worries. If someone blows the whistle on me, that'll cost a pretty penny in Germany. I think it'll be better to take a short break. Break? - Yes, here in Germany. So where do you want to go? To a country where the police don't interfere in people's personal lives. Are you afraid? - What a silly question! I'll come this evening. - No, you won't. Nobody's going to notice. They'll be asleep. I'm coming. You can do what you want. - lt'll be locked. The windowtoo? You are mistaken, Mr Teichmann. Your complaint against DrWinkler has nothing to do with the one against you. - Against me? The investigations into DrWinkler have not yet produced anything incriminating. But it's afact that he gathers young men of all ages around himself, influences them intellectually and dominates them... Reading poems, listening to music and looking at pictures aren't offences. That's not the point. With my son I've seen where it leads to. The very thought of that 'bar'... - Mr Teichmann, you have my word that Winkler is being observed. These people are usually careless. One day, he'll give us the evidence and he'll be caught in ourtrap. But he must be punished as a preventive measure. We can only punish crimes that have been committed and proven. I don't understand it. So we just stand and watch until it's too late? Well, according to this complaint you didn't just stand and watch. What complaint? - I have summoned you to answer a complaint made against you on grounds of a criminal offence under section 181 of the Penal Code. Against me? What section is that? - Procuration, Mr Teichmann. With a heavier penalty because it involved youths and dependents. I don't understand a word. Is it true that a Miss Gerda B?ttcher is employed as a maid in your house? Not employed; she lives with us as a lady's help. She's a little older than your son? - Yes, what's that got to do with it? You recently went on a lengthy trip with your wife, your lady's help and your son stayed alone at home. - Is travelling forbidden? This gave your lady's help the opportunity to get involved illicitlywith your son. The complaint states that you knowingly set up this opportunity. If anyone says that, I'll take them to court. This was stated not only by Dr Winkler, but also by your son. - No! Well, at least he intimated it to a friend. - This is incredible. So you knew nothing about it? - No. And your wife doesn't know anything either? - No! I'm asking you again to give me precise answers to precise questions. Or don't you want to answer? The police don't respond to melancholy looks. Or are you refusing to make a statement? In that case someone else will question you, but I doubt whether that'll be easier. Are you refusing to make a statement? - No. You may refuse only if answering would make you liable to prosecution. - I know. Then you know that refusing to make a statement gives the police the impression that you've got something to conceal. Why are you threatening me? - Do you want to assert that I've threatened you? Yes, I found it threatening. You're very smart, miss. Well then... When did you and Klaus Teichmann... I don't know howto express it, with you being so touchy... When was the first time it... took place with Klaus Teichmann? - Took place! Or did you just caress? Whatever it was, it was illicit. Why aren't you answering? - I can't. - Why not? You used such terrible words earlier... The police can't skate around the issues. That would lead to misunderstandings. My questions simply refer to the facts. My questions aren't improper. - But my answer would be. Miss B?ttcher, I've got a daughter myself. If she was in your position, I could only ask her precise questions. Would you like to be asked how she came into being, how it 'took place'? - What are you thinking? Who's being questioned, you or l? I love Klaus Teichmann and I've done everything that awoman does when she loves a man. So I'm not denying anything. What do you want from me? Should I write in the report that you did everything that awoman does? The public prosecutors will laugh at me. -Write what you want. And if you keep using those words, I'll say anything to get myself out of here. So I'm supposed to extract a confession? You're a shrewd one, aren't you? I'll have to bring a witness along. If you bring in a witness, I won't say anything else. So when did it start? - When the Teichmanns were away. Did Mr or Mrs Teichmann encourage you? Mrs Teichmann wasn't there, so she couldn't have encouraged me. Why Mrs Teichmann? Mr Teichmann was awaytoo. Yes, it's more likelythat awoman would sayto anotherwoman, my son's at risk of becoming homosexual, so get him back on track. I'll have to be responsible forwhat I've done. -You aren't being accused. Mr and Mrs Teichmann are suspected of engaging in procuration. Haven't you understood that? No, you really didn't indicate that. - Well, you know now. I thought I was being accused. - Oh, what you did isn't an offence! Have you spoken to Mrs Teichmann about her son's feminine disposition? Not directly. - Well, indirectly? You're really making things difficult. They often discussed it at home. The Teichmanns were worried sick. Were? So they aren't any more? - I assume they aren't. Do you find that funny? - The way you're asking, yes. So that was a great success for Mrs Teichmann. Why Mrs Teichmann? - I'm asking you! Are you playing cat and mouse with me? I can also use other methods. - I'm sure you can. Did you receive money from Mrs Teichmann recently, apart from your pay? That's what you'd ask a whore... - You need only say 'no'. - No. Have you received presents? - Often. I mean just recently, after Mrs Teichmann returned from the trip. N... no. - Come on, did you receive any presents? No! What are you shouting for? Why did you take so long to answer? - I had to think. What's there to think about? Aren't I allowed to accept presents? - Of course you are. Well? Are you refusing to make a statement? But that's tantamount to a confession. - So you're refusing to make a statement? I don't know what's punishable. - It can't be punishable, my child, when someone offers you a present and you don't accept it. You want to protect Mrs Teichmann, don't you? I'm not saying anything else. I only want to know if Mrs Teichmann offered you a present after returning from the trip. Yes. - A piece of jewellery? A bracelet. Stupid women, you've really landed us in it! The public prosecutor is instituting proceedings against me! People see me as a criminal. Me! Don't overreact, as usual. Nobody's after you. It doesn't matter whether it's you or l. I'm a manager at a large bank. - I don't think that's the main issue. So what is the main issue? We depend on my job. -We'll keep depending on it. But you knew about all that business with Gerda and Klaus. Don't you know it's a crime? - It isn't. Do you knowthe laws better? - No, not at all. Where are you going? Do you want to leave me alone now? Werner, if only you don't leave me on my own. - Me? What a stupid business! What's wrong? - It was terrible. What did they do with you then? - It's the way they ask questions. They can't do anything to you. - Not me, you. Oh, my child! Sorry I'm late. I had a client at the bank. Everyone wants credit... You know what it's like: big ideas but no money. So, what do you think? - I don't mind you coming late, this charge from the public prosecutor's office... - lsn't it insane? I never imagined that I'd ever have to deal with something like this. How can we clear it up? It can't be cleared up, Mr Teichmann. This charge set the case in motion. There will be a trial, and... - No! It can't come to that. It must be possible to withdraw the charge. I've heard of such cases. Yes, sometimes, in insignificant cases or where the evidence is insufficient. Then, perhaps, the case can be quashed. But in this case, no. You must come to terms with the fact that your wife must appear in court. That's appalling! - I'll have to speak to your ladywife. Why didn't she come here with you? I wanted to spare her all these hearings, inquiries, talks. I can't spare her those. I must speak to your wife. And then it's my fault as well. I caused it all by reporting Dr Winkler. Indeed you did. You should have come to me then. But I felt so in the right, and I was so outraged about Winkler, that I just did it. I want to protect mywife from all this. - I'm afraid that isn't possible. We've got to make serious preparations for a serious court case. This is a surprise. I didn't think you'd visit me again. You've got visitors, DrWinkler? - So it's not Boris any more? Can I talk to you alone? - Of course. Come right in. They're all good friends. That's William, that's Francesco, and Gustave... Anyway, they don't speak German. What's bothering you? You've reported my parents to the public prosecutor. Why? Have you asked your father why he reported me? I didn't know that. - I hope you told him he's an idiot. I'm sorry, he's your father, but even so. He wanted to do for me, so now I'm doing for him. To me you've always been awonderful person. And you want to say that's all wrecked now. Not if you retract this complaint. - But that's impossible. The case is taking its course and there's nothing anyone can do. Maybe your father's quite innocent. If nothing happened with that woman, nothing will happen to him. This is about my mother. Then it's true! So you can thank your Mr Clean father for putting your mother in prison. You've been underestimating me. No, Dr Schwarz. All the courts in the world can say what they want. If you're guilty, you can feel it. If you can't feel that any more, what's left to guide you? Madam, I'm glad that you're not afraid, but misjudging a situation is dangerous. Your clear conscience is sure to make a strong impression on the court. But even the most benevolent judge is bound bythe laws. -What laws? Sections 180 and 181 of the Penal Code. This law makes procuration a punishable offence. Procuration? That's not the right word. It makes it sound commercial. - Sit down, Christa. I fear you're not taking this seriously enough. I am taking it seriously. I know what I've landed myself in. A lot of people will turn up their noses at me. I might have done the same, if I'd heard about some other mother doing this. It was just there, all of a sudden. I just wanted the boy to be happy. How is he supposed to be happy if he stays in those circles? Love for a young girl, it's the most magical thing. I haven't forgotten how it was with us, Werner. When he's got his trade or profession, he should start a family, have children. For God's sake, I was afraid. - You're telling me? I was the first... You drew my attention to it. I wouldn't have noticed... Don't lose track now, madam. Your motives are clear, and it goes without saying that they will be respected. I hope you'll spare me from going to court, Dr Schwarz. My husband knows that you're an authority. You're putting me in a difficult position, madam. In my opinion there is no prospect of having the proceedings quashed. What do you think? Is that true? If Dr Schwarz says it is. But what have I done? It isn't only about your son. Gerda B?ttcher is a person too. It's a question of human dignity whether you can use a young girl... They love each other. - Sure. So if they do, can I be punished? Yes, madam. - How? With money? Prison? You've got to see things the way they are. So it's prison. There is hope that the court will acknowledge extenuating circumstances. However, you cannot necessarily expect an acquittal. I could be wrong, and I hope so, but under section 181, procuration can be punished with a prison sentence if the relationship between the guilty and the procured is that of parent to child. But they're criminals! They're criminals! Do you really think judges are criminals? But they love each other. I know it's not ideal, but they love each other. I'll help you. A defence counsel can explain, he can make things understandable, perhaps he can make a judge lenient. But... He can't make you innocent. No, nobody can make us innocent. Manfred, what are you doing here? You're going to Rome! - Yes, I'm on mywayto the station. You'll have to get by on your own now. It can't be helped. How do you know I'm leaving? - You told Carlos. Is he going to Rome, too? - No. I'm going to be very alone. I won't have Carlos, or Manfred, I'll have nothing. Look after yourself, my lad! Dr Winkler! Come with me, but as inconspicuously as possible. My train's about to leave. - Precisely. I'm sure you don't want me to use force. Where's the warrant? - The investigating magistrate will tell you... I couldn't care less... - Oh well, if you insist... What do want from me? - I'm not planning to question you on the street. I'll handcuff you if you mess me about. I'll hold you responsible for any damage. - Don't be ridiculous. We were planning to apprehend you in the courtroom. Why did you disappear so quickly? - I've given my evidence. Yes, you reported Mrs Teichmann and Gerda B?ttcher. You've brought disaster on these poor people. You've suddenly become so sensitive. The public prosecutor has enough evidence against you. -What for? Am I a prophet? Forget your trip to Rome. Your butler has been arrested. We know more than you think. Insofar as the misdemeanours affect the son of the defendant, the court does not deny that in this case, a mother committed a wrong out of concern about the development of her endangered child. The court does not doubt that Klaus Teichmann was very much at risk of becoming homosexual. But combating one wrong with another is not acceptable, nor bringing one person out of danger by endangering another. For alongside Klaus Teichmann there was someone else: Gerda B?ttcher, who, living in the defendant's house, was also in her care. There can be no doubt that this girl, who has impressed this court, would not have crossed the boundaries of common decency had she not been encouraged to do so by the defendant. The defendant will come to understand her guilt if she supposes for a moment that Gerda B?ttcher was her daughter. Would she have put her so unthinkingly at someone's disposal in order to get another mother's son back to a normal course of development? I think that we can justifiably doubt this. Even in acknowledgement of all the extenuating circumstances, which the court accepts, the defendant had to be sentenced on grounds of procuration under ? 181, subsection 2 of the Penal Code. In view of the special circumstances, however, the court imposes a sentence of six months' imprisonment. The sentence has been suspended on probation. The session is closed. You're guilty... and you don't even know it. Look at the kids. Come here! Mummy... Forgive me. It's all right. Everything's all right. Subtitling by Keith Semple, Andrea Kirchhartz
