- Hello. - Hi. Good morning. - Hey dude, is this Economics class? - No. Each one of us puts itself, and all our power... under the supreme command of the common will, welcoming each member as an indivisible part of a whole. - Okay, I get it, let's see... - What is it you understand? The people, gathered together, express the common will, which can never be wrong. But they are wrong. - They're always wrong... - It's not a party's plan of action. It's politic theory of the 18th century. It's meant to make you think. In fact, the French Revolution did not exist yet. - In fact it's him who anticipates it. - Okay, but what about dictators. People re-elect them once and again. How can't you not question something like that? Well, in fact he says the common will can be fooled. - By giving out free sandwiches you can! - C'mon man! - It's so funny! - Cheers! Look me in the eye... Don't you feel there're more old people in the city? Maybe it's the places you're going to. Maybe you're going to old people places. I really don't know that many places. - You have to give me a tour. - Okay. Where do you want to go? - Now? - Yes. - Like right now? - Yes. To your place. - What? - It's too far away. - Where? - Avellaneda. I can go with you. I enjoy the talk. The talk? I'm pretty sure it was you who spoke all the time. - Okay then, I'll speak no more. - Okay. - Did you stop? - It's your turn now. - It's the last one. On the left. - Okay. - You first, my lady. - Stop pretending you are a gentleman. - What do you mean? - You're just trying to check my ass. Hey Nico, take off, dude. I've got a girl. - No, c'mon man! - Yes, you jerkoff. Go. - Hello. - Hello. Hold on. I can't open this. ...by the world powers. They will start to incorporate Yugoslavia on '64. Cuba on '75... Roque Espinoza. Arrives at Buenos Aires... to take undergraduate courses for the third time. During the first few months he attends classes, listens, rambles around the hallways. He can't yet quite understand the place he has arrived to. Walsh, Mate, Vertiente, Counter-dominance, En Acto, P.O., Prisma, The gathering, M.S.T., La Mella, Brecha. None of these has any meaning yet. Nevertheless, that one, instead of classes and teachers, will be the universe of this story. THE STUDENT - Hi. - Did you bring everything? Yes. Thanks. Sure it's cool that I stay? Yes, a friend of my dad's cousin was staying before. - The place is kind of meant for it. - Okay, cool. Dad! Hello. - This is Roque, a friend. - Hi there. - Nice to meet you, Roque Espinoza. - How do you do? Horacio. You can put your stuff there. Good, thanks. - So you are from Ameghino, right? - Yes. - Did you always live there? - No. I spent a month at La Plata, but went back right after. Who is in the government there? The Peronists? Yes. For a while already. - Did you vote for them? - I did once. - Don't tell me you are a Peronist. - No. They're all the same anyway. - The same what? - I mean politicians. So do you vote for anyone or you don't vote at all? What I mean is there's not much difference. I know a guy, back at Ameghino, who was with Alfonsin during his turn, part of the UCD after that, and now is a Peronist Councilor. What are you talking about? Lend me a hand here. - Ready? - There it is! Cut the crap, man! You cut the crap! Hold this. Hey dude... - What's up with Valeria, dude? - Valeria? We're just friends. You try to play it cool, dude, but you're just a dirty hick like me. Yes, but with you anyone can tell. So because of your leather jacket you think with you they can't? Check how you speak. How do you think you sound? I speak fine. Vale... Who's more of a hick out of us? - What? - Who looks more as a hick? - Him or me? - Which one? You're a couple of morons. Give me that. You don't want to tell me? -300th Azcuenaga street. - Do you live alone? Hey! Vale! You're leaving? Wait. So did you trade me in for another already? - What's up with you? - Where did you pick him up? He's a friend. - Introduce me to him. - No. - What's the problem? He's just a friend. - No, no no! How do we settle the keys? I can drop them in the mailbox or you can jump over the fence. I'll get there earlier anyway. I'm really drunk. I'll get there earlier. Do you want me to stay up waiting just in case? - Bye. - Bye. ...Syllabus need to be reformatted. Set up a workshop, where all three senates can be a part of. A lie! Fellow students, we are facing a historical week. It's not their intention to change! It's the same old people, telling the same old story! We can't stall the debate! We have to get organized to prepare an alternate plan. And put the workshop together. With or without them! We need an independent plan! One born amongst us students! Fellow students! We need to keep going forward! If we fight for a syllabus change, We can't expect it to come from nobody but ourselves! Thank you! Paula, from Brecha! Hello, good evening, I'm Paula Castillo from Brecha. First and foremost, I'm glad we are discussing this. A thirty year old syllabus... can't be a powerful intellectual tool to act upon in Argentina nowadays. Besides, to carry on this plan there's an aging teaching staff, who insists on the sustainment of an intellectual program... which does not represent at all the contradictions we currently face. So, I believe we are missing a fundamental part... of this discussion to change the plan, which is the political one. We all know the teachers more reluctant to review the plan... are just the ones in charge of the council's majority. We face that in each session. So... What's our strength to confront them? All of us. We students. Our classmates. Ourselves. How many of us are we here today? How many? How many out of a ten thousand student body? I think what we need to do is to get closer to the students. Try to understand their expectations instead of pretending... that they should encompass ours. We need to show we can lead a true transformation. And that means we need to work seriously, people. Paula Castillo. Twenty-nine years old. Assistant teacher at one of the main courses. A graduate from the Nacional Buenos Aires, where she started her political activity. At seventeen she becamea member of the M.S.T.. No activity from eighteen to twenty-one. Later, at the university, she joined an independent left wing front during four years, until she decided to quit politics forever. Two years later, alongside many of her mates, she co-founds the Brechafaction, where she is currently still active. Through her, through the relationship with Paula, politics finds its way into Roque's life for the first time. Intransigence is only going to lead us to more failure. I think we can avoid failure today. By carrying on with a real political action. That's the only way to avoid failure, and to reach, once and for all, real victory. Thank you. We were saying... In classic tradition, an examination of political life and state life, are inseparable from their appraisal. - From Plato, to Maquiavelo... - Excuse me. As I was saying, from Plato to Maquiavelo... - Are they Franja? - No, they're not Franja. They have the same bullshit social democrat speech. - Deep inside they are pro-government. - Of course. They play the right cards with the rectorship. All elections are the same. I can't understand why they don't get exposed. It's ridiculous. - What about her? - What about who? The one called Paula. - Forget about her. - Why? I know what I say. - What is it? - What do you want to know? That she fucks Acevedo, for example? - Acevedo? The old guy? - Yes. Everyone knows. - Really? - Yes. Besides she is short, has a loud voice. She sounds as if she was always with a cold. I can't stand her. I can't believe you like her. I don't like her. Not at all. It's just that if you leave me I need a replacement. - You always had a replacement. - You did too. I was asking because she is my teacher. What? - You are taking her class? - I'm not taking it. She is my teacher. - That's not the way to hook up with her. - I don't intend to hook up with her. - She is a really good teacher. - Who would have thought! - Why don't you take her class? - No way! - She is really good. - No fucking way. - Excuse me, Professor. - Yes? - I'm one of your students. - Yes. I just saw you in class. I missed the first classes and wanted to know what lessons I missed. Did you ask any of your classmates? Yes. But I wanted to know which books you're using. - Do you have the course curriculum? - No. Log onto the course's website. The book list is posted there. Okay. Sure. I was actually looking for more specifics... Maybe something you can recommend as complementary reading. So you are actually asking for a personal recommendation. Yes. Can't think of anything now. Do something. Email me. I can think about it and get back to you if I come up with something. - Good. Can I have your mail? - Yes. Paula Castillo... All together, no capitals. At gmail dot com. - At gmail dot com. - Yes. - Email me and I'll answer back. - Thanks. If men are more or less equals... at their physical and intellectual capacities, they all feel they have the same rights. In virtue of that equality, fear is born. Someone might claim for himself what is mine. So, from that effective attack, or that attack as protective defense, what we call war in natural state is born. Excuse me, Professor. At this moment in history, to keep saying that war between men is natural, is deceiving. Marx said, more than a hundred years ago, that war between men... is the result of capitalism, which has no restraints for its exploitation plans. That certainly is a part of Marxism tradition. You can also trace it back to Rousseau, who stands opposite to Hobbes, who says problems in society and war... are a consequence of living inside a civilization. I think that at this point in history, to keep saying... that capitalism is the origin of all that's wrong... Then we should state that during Feudalism or the Middle Ages... No, Mariela! Exploitation in any of its forms. During Feudalism, the Middle Ages, capitalism... Exploitation! We can't keep thinking... that men turn to evil because of exploitation. But that there is exploitation because men... do not regret their evil deeds. So you think it's natural? We should do nothing about it? I wouldn't say do nothing. I'd say there's nothing to do. I just don't get it. Why are you taking this course for? I'd think it's because you want to make a change in society. Don't you? I study because I like to think about society. Not transform it or lead it. - I read because I like to. - Hey, come on now! That line of thinking is the one that moves students away from politics. - Absolutely! - It just sounds too conformist. It's saying politics has no meaning. I think we need to keep thinking. Searching for options. It's because I keep thinking that I realize there're no more... Okay... On the other hand, I think... It's time... It's time we stop seeing each other... That we only get together when we meet to. During meetings... I think that's the place... Hello. - Hello. - Is this seat empty? - Sure. - It's all packed. Yes, it's full of people at this time. I'm getting another coffee. Do you want one? - I'd rather have a beer. - A beer? - Yes. - Cool. - Are you up for one? - Yes. Let me get them. - Med school, and then Business. - Yes. Then I went back and worked for a while. There I realized I wanted to study. Yes, sure. But why Buenos Aires? Why this degree? I'm sort of interested in the degree by itself. - Something regarding the social aspect. - Social? Yes. Investigation too. I think the degree... Its field of expertise is pretty big... - There are many things to do. - What kind of things? So many questions! This looks like an interrogation. It's not an interrogation. If I ask it's because I'm interested. - You say a lot. I just want to know. - You're kind of intimidating. - I intimidate you? - Yes. You do. It was not my intention. - I would have tried to kiss you if not. - What? I'm sorry. What were we talking about? Aristotle, the academy... You better not go down that road. This is where I live. There's a party next Thursday at the block. - Maybe you want to go. - Sure. Cool. - Won't you invite me for a beer? - Right now? Yes. I'm kind of tired. - I'll see you at the party. - Yes, sure. - Okay? - Okay. So Roque... So Paula. - Cool. Bye. - Bye. - Did you arrive early? - Yes. We posted the stuff for the election. And then arranged everything for the party. - You're doing the election now. - Yes. - Wanna come with me? - Let's go. - We'll share it. Okay? - Okay. Are they all from the group? Them? Yes. Let me see... - Sort of. It's a mixed crowd. - You gathered a lot of people. - We did! - Yeah. The majority are undergraduates who come for the party anyway. They could be at any of the other group's parties. Politics apart, it's a good way to meet people. - Why did you get in? - Me? Yes. - Boring. - Boring! - Yeah. Too boring. - You don't want to tell me. - Do you want me to? - Not if you don't want to. My parents were politically active. I started being active at school. Then I had a teacher at the university... on a course I really liked. - I helped during one election so... - Who? Acevedo? - Yes. Do you know him? - Yes. Not in person, but heard the name. - He is a really good teacher. - Really? - I love this song. - You do? There you are! - Are you okay? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. Are you cold? Do you want me to fix you something to eat? I'd love to. But I don't have anything. Let's go get breakfast. My treat. - An invitation to eat! - Yes. - Do you want to go? - Yes. Let's. ...and other bourgeoisie governments of the region. We find these to be related... to the blossoming of revolutionary movements during the sixties. - I was worried you didn't come last night. - I'm so fucking tired... - How did the party go? - Good. That good? Excuse me, professor. Shouldn't you put this situation in a larger scale context? Lautaro, the past class you took all the time... The problem is your class is based on historical errors and omissions. - I just started talking... - How come in this institution, a professor, or assistant professor actually, can stand in front of 40 students with no knowledge of what the class is about? The story of a continent plundered by imperialism for five centuries. Stop it, Lautaro! You can't interrupt every five minutes. Those governments you talk about are an expression of class weakness. The bourgeoisie running countries for their own benefit. What do you mean? This is not related to the subject of the class... Your class denies that Latin America... was founded over the massacre of native cultures. Do you want to talk about native cultures? - What do you know about the civil war? - There's not a chance for democracy. Answer me! Do you know who Huayna Capac is? Do you know who Tupac Yupanqui is? What can you tell me about the subjugation... the Aztec imposed on neighbor societies? What about the tribute they had to pay them? Do you know anything about Moctezuma? About the destruction of Chaipu and Tacnaca? What do you know about the Seminole war? You know nothing! Listen! Learn! Study. Read. When you know what you are talking about we can sit and discuss. I'll never set foot in this class again. This class is disastrous. A class that denies the native holocaust and victimizes the Spanish. You don't know what you are talking about. Go study and then we can discuss. I'm sorry. Where were we? - Did you see my shoes? - They're there. - Are you going out? - Yes. - Again? - Yes. Take a look. These are the people you vote for. Nice people! Always playing for the government side no matter what. Your candidates are not very inspirational... When they get their ideas together we can sit and talk. Suddenly yours are all left-wing. - You are always against transformation. - Who says that? - Is that you talking? - Yes. It's me. - And he stands up for them! - It's the bad influence. I have always believed that. - That's why I didn't vote for them. - Why didn't you? The path to transformation should not be the one that takes the extreme side. On the long run. that doesn't imply a true commitment to the will to change. - You're on fire! - You speak of commitment... Your party has never committed to anything. You have always ruled in a conservative way. Why do you talk in general if I'm speaking for myself? - Are you speaking for yourself? - Yes. I am. C'mon! Don't talk to me about the will to change. That's your revolutionary party. Always running whatever way the wind blows. Nonsense. I never said the word revolutionary. - Did you hear me say revolutionary? - Your party was the one that said it. - What party? - Your tiny little party. - I speak for myself. - You speak for yourself? - These are no new ideas from class? - No. All by myself. Nothing to do with classes. Why do we need to wait? This us our moment. We have to take advantage of it. Our moment? Are you listening to yourself? You are a traitor. - This is unacceptable! - But give it some thought, Paula. Give it five minutes of your time. We've been discussing this for a long time. - I don't want this to end up bad. - It will not end up bad. He is threatening us! He is threatening us! Stop for a minute. Let's hear what his new proposal is. Okay. They want to work with us. They want us to join their party. I think we have many things in common. If we want to win the election, we need to sacrifice part of the list. Perfect. Do you want to work with them? Do you want us to join forces with them? Why are we discussing this if this son of a bitch has everything planned? - Don't talk to me like that! - Do you want to own the student center? - To create a new party under your name? - They're talking about sharing the lead. - Six months each. - Yeah, sure. That's bullshit! That way, key positions end up being filled in by morons. What do you mean key positions? We've been discussing this for a long time. - Don't be a paranoid! - Hello. I'm not done yet. - Do you want me to wait for you? - Okay. Precisely! The fact that they're more... We need to take a decision. Okay. We'll discuss it amongst all of us. - But you put yourself in a tough spot. - It's not that difficult... - Sorry I'm so late. - Is everything okay? - No. It really sucks. - What happened? - It's Angel. The bastard betrayed us. - I don't understand. Miguel is our main candidate. We've settled that from the start. - I insist. He won't make it in. - Good evening. - Hello. - Hi, Acevedo. - Keep going... - I think it means immediate defeat. It weakens us as a party. Let's not go back to that. We can't step aside on this election. Period. Hold on. The worst thing we can do right now is stepping down. - Do we all agree on that? - Totally. - We will look like fucking idiots. - We already are fucking idiots. We are no idiots. You always think you have everything figured out. - Why don't you make a proposal? - Don't talk to me like that. - Then say something! - Yes Paula, say something. I should come up with something? You have been absent at meetings for a week! - Suddenly you appear and... - Listen, people! Everyone agrees the alliance is not possible? Angel leaves to be one of their candidates? Yes, it's a fact What's the problem then? Why is Angel so important? Do you think people at the new party are not looking forward to this? Do you think they really care for Angel? Angel is just another student. Yes. He is a good speaker. He is a career man. He can win debates. But what's really important to them... is your despair. The blow to your morale. The fact that you are here insulting each other. Just drinking down all the poison they've fed you. So, one more time. Don't despair. Yes. Worst case scenario, we lower expectations. - Win at politics, see how we... - No, no, no! Now it's time to work. Catharsis is over. They played a tricky move on you. The most tricky of all. Treason. But the most common at the same time. You'll experience this one all the time. Alberto Acevedo. Head of the Latin American Social model of Thinking professorship. Member of the University's Superior Council, the professor's senate. On April 16th, 1986, during an intense speech, Alfonsin, the president at that time, invited Argentines to move south. Into the sea, into the cold. The Patagonia Bill was created. It established the move of the Federal Capital to territories in Viedma, Carmen de Patagones, and Guardia Mitre, at the south of Argentina. The Bill, something the federals had long yearned for, got approved one year later, after several months of negotiation and discussion at Congress. High costs, economic instability, a fragile government, made the Bill fail. Nevertheless, the relocation Bill was never abolished by Congress. Alberto Acevedo is one of the five names written at the document's footer. - Okay. We have our man then. - It's done. - Now comes the hard part. - Let's see the bright side of it! Or this is going to be impossible. - Excuse me... - What shall we do? This is not my turf, but... Angel is a traitor. You can't let him win. He definitely can. Well, yes... But he is a motherfucker. Something needs to be done. What do you want us to do? - To put up signs explaining that? - I don't know. At least you should say it. Why wouldn't you say it? I don't get what this guy says. - That's not how it works, Roque. - I don't thinks it's that complicated. You just go out and tell everyone. It doesn't matter what you say. Why would they believe it? - Why? Because it's the truth. - This is politics, man. So what? The guy fucked you up. - He betrayed you. He's a son of a bitch. - Yes. he did. He switched parties for his own good. He's a son of a bitch. - But this is not so simple, Roque. - Wait. What if... - I have friends here. - Oh! Like that's going to help! - Should we beat the crap out of him? - Let him speak, Lorenzo. What I mean is I know a lot of people. They will believe in me. No. If we spread this out, we stand to be taken as stupids. I mean, a month before elections, your candidate walks out on you... Your party is no good so he walks out of it. We are going to be the dumbest party on earth. Better to leave things as they are now. Excuse me. I believe people are going to think he is a motherfucker, rather than think you are idiots. You stand to be taken as a fool if you let anyone mess with you in politics. Do it then. As a personal thing. It doesn't have to be on behalf of the party. Let him do it. There's nothing to lose for us. What do you think? I agree with Paula. - If we have to wait for the friends of... - Roque. Roque's friends to solve the election for us... We are in trouble. Okay then. It was just an idea. What do you propose, Miguel? The first thing to do is work on the banners. They were a weak point during previous elections. Then we should set up debates... Hey man. I'm cool with your cause, but you only complain and take no action. Both the student center and the dean are undermining a public university. You know you can't win or you would speak seriously. What's the matter with you? What party are you with? The UES. The UES? They're fucking bureaucrats. They are in alliance with the government. - And you are a bunch of chickens... - What's your problem? Hey, come on! No insults. Calm down! It's my point of view, okay? Alliances are not a bad word. They are words to get power. Power to manage. Power at any cost. Is that what you want? - To bury this university? - Bury this university? What are you talking about? Speak seriously for once. Check what Angel did. I bet you think what Angel did is wrong. Angel who? Come back here! Angel Molina? What did that motherfucker do? He was so good! So good! He planned an alliance. With the guys at El Puente and la Nueva Estudiantil. They didn't go for it. He left Brecha. Now he is heading the UES list. Are you kidding me? Are you saying that motherfucker is in the UES ranks now? Yes. At least now he has a chance to run the student center. Is this a fact? Are you telling me the truth? - You are not lying to me? - Open your eyes. Politics has changed, man. We finished analyzing the rebellious movements at Latin America... - during the twentieth century... - Excuse me, professor! Come in. - I'm happy you are back. - Me too. All what's left to finish with this class is... to analyze the end of these movements, and the aperture of new democracies in Latin America. The whole continent supports peace throughout its institutions, and democratic leadership. You have a lot of nerve talking about confidence in the democratic process, when logical structure of the parties, elections, democracy, are betrayed. - No. Stop it, Lautaro... - Don't you tell me to stop! You can't tell your tale while... While he talks to us about democracy and institutions, he has just fucked his party and his partners, for an agreement that will land him as president of the student center. That's your democracy. Traitors, back stabbers. What are you saying, you idiot? Leave my class right now! What do you think you are doing? My name is Roque, from Brecha. Some of you already know me. Our proposal has to do with real commitment. So us students, definitely take our place at the student center. We want our proposal to be based on achievement, not on slogans. We want to sit down at the senate and discuss. We know there are progressive sectors amongst teachers and graduates, with whom we can sit down and plan a better university. Congratulations. Why? We came in second. Don't play dumb with me. - You didn't vote. - No way. That's good. What are you doing up? I was having breakfast and saw you go by. Staggering... - We have a class. Remember? - Right now? Aren't you coming? No. You can tell me about it later. Can you call my name when they take the roll? No. Are you going to sleep in your clothes? - Take my pants out. - No way! - Please! C'mon. - No. Besides, you have a girlfriend now. - She is not my girlfriend. - Because she doesn't want to! That's true! Please help me. I can't do it myself. Let's see... - You take it out! - C'mon, help me! Please! You're so hysterical! Who are you calling hysterical? You son of a bitch! - Stop it! - I'm not hysterical! - You are not calling me hysterical! - Hey! You are hitting hard! - Jaime! - Hi there Roque. - What's up, dude? - Fine. You? I'm cool. What about you? - Studying? - Yes, trying to. - All cool? - All cool, man. Hello. - Hi there. - Hello. Hi there, Roque. Everything fine? We got the permit for the photocopy kiosk. Really? - Yes. - Cool! - Alberto told me an hour ago. - Cool. What are you going to do? I have to speak to Balbo. If we start the paperwork now... - I think we can announce it next week. - Excellent. That's perfect. Cool. I want some of our people in. Okay. I don't think that's a problem. - Cool. - I'll let you know tomorrow anyway. Sure. Let me know. So this is Roque's new life. He tries hard to keep attending classes, but realizes his focus is not there anymore. It's outside. In the meetings and gatherings at the student center. In the activities and discussions he is a part of at the party. Even though he keeps studying, he realizes his real job, his real talent, is managing people. Tactics and strategy. Decision making and execution. Discuss arguments, come up with alliances... Make friends, give orders. Politics in its pure form. Hi! - Hi, Roque! How are you doing? - How's it going? - Good, and you? - Fine. - How are you doing, Alberto? - How are you? Everything's fine? What a nice house, man! - Well, thanks! - Congratulations! - Hello! How are you doing? - Fine. I thought I was going to be the first one. No. Paula will always be the first one. - Have you met Roque? - Hello! - Hi! You are Roque. - How are you, Elvira? - Good! - A pleasure. - How did you get here? - Fine, no problem. - It's easy, isn't it? - Yes, yes! Yes, he draws a map and all that, but... I caught one of those buses who are faster so... Ah! They take only a couple of minutes... Hipolito! Hey, man! How are you? It's exciting to be back at this historical place! - Hi! How are you doing? - Everything's fine. Look at this place! Here, Argentine politics has been at stake. - Oh! Really? - Yes... Presidents of the Republic have slept on that hammock! Fortunately, just one... Don't shout! The neighbors must be sick... of hearing you saying the same old silly things! Silly things? I'm telling the truth! Look! That grill should belong in a museum of the Republic. But what? That is the problem with Balbo! The problem is just that. He always agrees with everything. How do you think he made his career? For God's sake! What I can't understand is if you propose supporting Vinas or not. I don't know! Ask him, who involved you in politics! No, no! They did it by themselves! Don't make me the guilty party... It's difficult for me to think of one more Vinas' administration. Do you think that the students are going to allow that? Anyway, since when students' opinion is important? What do you say? Listen to those who are smarter than you. Yes, sure, because they repeat everything you say. Well, thanks for your trust! Let's be serious. Who are you going to support? Balbo! See what I say? First they get angry, and then they say the same bullshit he says. You are drunk. Don't be aggressive. - I'm not aggressive! - Yes, you are! Don't worry! It's already nap time for elder men. Go to sleep, Hipolito! Fine, I'm going to sleep. But first I'm going to tell you who is Balbo. I've known him for about thirty years. I met him at school, in Rosario. Do you know what Balbo did? Do you know where he was politically active? He was a Christian Democrat! Well, so what? Come on! A Christian Democrat! For God's Sake! Apart from that, what job did he have in the governor's office? Thing is, the Governor couldn't see very well. Balbo would sit next to him every morning, he prepared mate for him and he read him the news. That's Balbo! My God! But wasn't he Minister of Education? Sure! Because he can read and prepare mate. That's the reason he was appointed, that's the way it is. That's the way things are in Santa Fe. Do you think I'm joking? Knowing how to serve mate well, is a one way trip to Minister. That's the way it is. You are impossible! Since when have you turned that cynic? Since when? Say, twenty one years ago... Since they kicked us out of the government. - Roque, do you have a minute? - Yeah, sure! We need to talk about an important matter. - Did you hear about the plenary, right? - Yes, in June. No. We are going to move it forward. It must be now. - When? - Next month, at the most. Oh, very soon. I want you to be in charge of the organization. - Can you do it? - Yes, yes, sure. - But wasn't Miguel the one doing it? - I'll talk to him. You will do it. Do you dare? - What about Paula? - Do you want to do it or not? - Yes, sure, of course! Yes, yes. - Okay then. Pay attention to me, then, because it is a complicated topic. It's the moment when it will be defined if the other groups will support Balbo. Everything we are doing depends on that plenary. You have to find the right place, and it can't be in Buenos Aires. We'll need accommodation and transportation for the people. Paula's going to be in charge of contacting the referents, but you have to make sure that all the groups are represented. - Roque, you have a second? - Now? - Yes. - Anything wrong? Yes, it'd be good if we could talk for a minute. Okay, sure, yes. - Hi, Mili. - How are you, Roque? When I checked the safe, I realized 3,800 pesos were missing! We thought we had done the math wrong, we checked the books, but no... Yes, we were surprised, too. - When was that? - On Friday. Okay. And apart from you two, who else knows about it? Well, Jara who came like crazy to balance the accounts... and was going to report it to the Police, to the school... It was then when Arturito spoke, he said that he hadn't stolen the money, that he was going to give it back, that it was in his house... - Nobody from Brecha knows? - No. - Just Jara and you, right? - Yes. Lorenzo doesn't know? Paula doesn't know? You're fucking stupid! You should have told someone! How are you going to take money from the safe, you jerk? I had no money at all, man. I had to pay the rent... - When are you going to give it back? - I had to travel to Resistencia, I had bills to pay, I was in a lot of trouble, I was going to get the money and bring it back, man! So when are you going to return it? They want it back tomorrow! I can't get it for tomorrow! Calm down, okay? Who checked the safe? Maximo Jara, from Linea Sur. Do you know him? - No. Which career? - Social Work. - Who coordinated? - Eliseo Mendez. Okay. We'll look for him. You are going to look for him? What do you want to do? Listen to me, man, listen! Did you want to steal the money? I didn't want to steal it, man! Can't you get it? I didn't want to! - Tell me the truth! - I didn't want to steal the money! - Then, we're going to talk to them! - Are you crazy? If not, they're going to denounce it and fuck us up, man! Do you get it? I didn't want to steal that money. Yes, yes. That's fine for me. And when is that? When? Can we do it? Yes? Sure? Okay then. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Let's go, Arturo. I don't want to get you in trouble. I'm already involved now. Come on, man... Come on... He's the one in the middle. Hi! How's it going? Are you Jara? How's everything, man? I'm Roque, from school too. He's Arturo. I think you've already met him. - Why did you come here? - He is in a mess, - I wanted to talk to you. - It's not just a mess. 4 thousand bucks were stolen... -38 hundred... - How do you dare come here? - You stole them! - Hey, man! Stop it! He had a problem. You are doing the correct thing, but can't you let him explain? If the money is not there tomorrow, I'll denounce it, you know that. - Calm down, let's talk. - Calm down, what? Get out of here! - Let him explain it to you! - Get out of here, man, out! - Wait, wait, and wait! - Come on! Get out of here, man! Cool it man! Cool it. Cut it out! Cut it out! He had a personal problem and had to travel to Resistencia, and used that money to help his family, do you think that's bad? Of course it's bad! That's a robbery, man! Can't you get it? The money will be there in a week, it's just a loan. - Haven't you ever had a problem, man? - I don't fucking care! - He should have told us about it! - Yes, I know, you are right! You are right, he was really wrong. He should have come over and talk to us. What do we do now? - He must leave school! - You ruin my life, man. - You really ruin it. - That's the way it is. Fuck you. - You acted all wrong. Fuck you. - Hey man, listen. I can help you. I know about the problem you had with Pinto. I can make you pass that course.. - I can manage that myself. - Are you sure? - I don't want you to cheat for me. - I haven't said that. I haven't said that. Exams are coming in three weeks. I can make the assistant teacher go alone, she won't be there. There's a Congress in Bariloche, they're deciding which professors will go. I can make her travel. - Can you do that? - Sure! If you don't report the theft to the police. Give back the money you took. In the same place. - Yes, the money will be back in a week. - This jerk won't work in there anymore. Yes, okay. Don't worry. The money will be back in a week. - Thanks, man. Thanks! - Go away! Don't fuck with me! I'm sick and tired of you. Here we are. Horacio. - Oh! Look who's here! - How are you man? - How are you doing? - How are you, man? - Dear Roque! - Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm so sorry. Don't worry. Now you are a busy person who deals with important people. Yes, you can't imagine how important I am. Impressive! Take a seat. So, you are working with Alberto Acevedo. - Yes, man. - You don't change sides. Always with the same people, that's fine. Although I tell you this Acevedo is not one of the worst ones. I think he was in the Ministry of Education, if I'm not wrong. - He was in Public Works. - Public Work! Not easy... Well, yes. Although Vale told me he's quite well respected at school. Well, I don't know if respect is exactly how to put it. Well, he helped me a lot. He's a good guy, yes. Well, while you don't learn to rob and so on, everything's okay. Did you bring the meat? No... Meat? Did I have to buy meat? Well, the asado is made of meat. - I'll go get it now then. - Okay. Hey, man! Don't worry, come here. Vale, lend me a hand. - How can I help you? - No, you stay there. Sit down there that you are our honor guest today. He bought it. It's not only about Vinas, is it? For us it's a process of recomposition of the authorities. - Hello. Excuse me. - Hello. How are you? Listen, it is the fourth meeting we have. Time goes by. We have settled on the main points, haven't we? Perhaps there are same small issues that we have to polish... Lorenzo, maybe for you it's clear because it serves your purpose. We don't care about it at all. It's of no use for us. What we care about is to create a program... together with the activists and our mates. Well, sorry. Regarding what Lorenzo says, we have the plenary for that, don't we? For us to think together the direction to take. We need to join forces not only to get votes, - but also to support our project. - Listen, Roque... There are a lot of issues before the plenary. - Yes, yes. - Let's see which ones they are. What I propose is to discuss the candidates now. Let's talk it over right now. Long before the mess of the plenary. This way we'll guarantee we'll be a lot stronger at that moment. Biqueiras? What do you say? I think it's very interesting what he's doing for his chair. No. He hasn't even studied at the University. Well, that has nothing to do. Yes, he's going to be dismissed as from the very beginning. Let's choose a candidate against whom, at least, they won't have arguments to dismiss so fast. I think I've talked this over with some of you, but you know the support that Balbo's candidature is having. - Balbo? - Yes, yes, Balbo. Balbo has the support of many of the deans. Balbo did many things. You may like him or not, but the guy has the power to unite groups with different opinions. Is there something wrong? Are you all right? Yes, I'm really fine. You don't answer my messages, you don't say hello to me... I didn't like how you handled the missing money issue. Wait. Listen to me first. Do you know how it was? Yes, I know all I need to know. - He gave the money back and that's it. - Because you took it from another place. No! He put half of the money. Do you know why he did it? Look at me! You know the problems the guy has with his family? I don't care about it. You did it alone, behind my back! It's okay. If you want, I'm a son of a bitch. That's it. You are not a son of a bitch, you are even worse, you are sloppy! I feel you've been putting me down for a long time and I don't know why. You say it's not about political stuff but I'm not that sure. - No? So, what is it, then? - I don't know, I'm asking you. - Tell me. - I don't understand... why you treat me like this. I really don't. Come on! Tell me what you are thinking! I know what it is! What? If you are offended about the plenary, come on and tell me! The plenary, you see? That's what you're thinking of! But what's the problem? Are you jealous? You don't like the fact that I'm in charge of some things. - Me, jealous? - Yes. You know what we can do? If it bothers you, I leave the group and that's it! I'll tell you just once and you're going to listen to me! If you are working with the plenary, it's because I wanted you to do it. - Oh, yes? - Yes! Alberto asked me... if I thought you were capable of doing it, and I had to insist. So, don't fuck with that anymore! If you are doing it, it's because I wanted you to do it! - So, what's the fucking matter with me? - Don't shout, asshole! - Stop shouting like that! - Leave me if you want! - This won't be the first time I'm left! - You are an idiot. You just don't get it! Let's vote then. No problem... - We can start with... - Slow down, slow down. Let's check the names again. Biqueira, Molteni, Miller, Balbo. Let's choose one of those four, and the problem is finished. Truth is, we don't know Balbo that well. We should consider the possibility of talking with him, see if we can find some coincidences, before moving forward. - That's fine. - We can talk with him. Let's invite him to a workshop. Yes, we can invite him to the plenary if necessary, no problem at all. I think the plenary is a good idea, so we can have him close and see if... So, you are Roque Espinoza, from the University, and you need a venue to hold a students' meeting. - Yes, it's a plenary. - Okay. - And, when would that be? - That'd be next month, on the weekend of the 5th and the 6th. - Do you think he will see me? - No, I don't think so. He's very busy. Yes, Doctor. Here I am with the boy from the University who needs a place... for a meeting, do you remember? Yes, yes, it's the last one. Perfect. Bye. You may go in. - Thanks. - You're welcome. They told me you need a place... - for a students' event, right? - Yes, exactly. We are from the University of Buenos Aires and we are organizing a plenary. - Plenary? Politics? - Yes. - That's fine! - Yes, we are students. When would it be? In the weekend of the 5th and the 6th. Precisely that week... we have the Sports Club occupied. So I'm afraid it will be impossible. You could try getting in touch... with one of the camping places on the other side of the lagoon, so that you have the possibility of carrying it out. - Of course, they'll charge you. - Thank you, sir. But we don't have a lot of money, that's why we are asking for support. Then, the only thing that comes to my mind now... is to contact you with one of the nearby town's mayors. It could be Canuelas, Las Flores or Azul. Sure... Well, if that's the case, then it would be best for me to go back to my town. - So you are not from Buenos Aires? - No, not at all. I grew up in a town that's on road 188. It's called Ameghino. - What was your last name? - Espinoza, Roque Espinoza. - Are you the son of Victor Espinoza? - Do you know him? Sure, of course! No, Victor is my uncle. I'm the son of Ernesto, the youngest... Little Ernesto Espinoza, he was such a rascal! So tell me, how's Victor? What about him? Fine. Fine, he's really fine. He's there, managing the stores and at the Federation, as usual. Yes, he's always been on it. Is he still married? - So far... - Yes? - Yes. - Beautiful woman, really distinguished. Yes, that's why he won't let her go that easily. - Do you know that she was my girlfriend? - Really? - Yes, before she got married. - What a coincidence! - He's never talked to me about that. - He keeps it under lock and key. I'll tell you something, she won't let him go that easily, either. - Victor has done very well. - Really? Back in town they called him Yolanda. - Why? - Yolanda some money! We used to call him Check mate for dummies. Why? You had to be dumb not to check his mate. - How many of you are coming? - About thirty, no more than thirty five. Well... Hello, Lorena? Yes, could you send Refusta, please? - Hey! - How are you doing? - What are you doing here? - How's it going? - Fine, and you? - Finished working? Yes, I've just gone out. Well, in fact, I came here... - to have a beer with a friend of mine. - Good. - What are you doing here? - I was having a beer by myself. - You are always alone. - Yes, but I like to be alone. - You do? - Yes! - I'll go then, so I won't bother you. - No! I'm not saying it because of you. - It's okay. - And what are you going to do? Well, nothing... I don't know... Is there something to do? - Hello. - Hi! How are you? Hi! I thought it was you. Too many numbers in the caller I.D. - Did I wake you up? - No. - Where are you? - On a cab, coming back from Marisa's. - Ah! You met there? - No. I went alone. - Alone? - Yes, girls night out. Yes, sure. Have you talked about me, at least? - No. - I don't believe you. - Just a little bit. - Still not buying it. - What about you? How are you? Good! I got everything. - Really? Everything? - Yes... They are giving us accommodation, transportation, food... The Municipality is helping us. Great! I knew you were going to do it. Yes, yes... They are all coming on Saturday. I'm pretty anxious because I really want to see you. But I won't be going. I have to cover Alberto's hours, too. What? Really? Yes. He asked me yesterday. Why don't you ask Marisa to do that? I don't know. He asked me to do it. I must do it. I miss you. I really want to see you. Me too but... We have to talk. What? What do we have to talk about? I don't understand. Calm down! Nothing serious. Just talking. I miss you too. I've been thinking about you. Then, it makes no sense to talk. If you miss me, you love me. If you love me, you want to be with me, and if you want to be with me, you love me, that's it. Don't be that basic. I'm basic, I'm in love. I love you. Aren't you going to say anything? Over the phone? - You could say I love you. Right now? The taxi driver is listening. Come on! Say it! Okay... I love you. But I can tell you later... ...management supported by the groups, is coming to an end. The administration is afraid of the students' movement, and fears unity... To be severe with the mistakes of the University, but, at the same time, to introduce options to solve those mistakes. Because to throw out those guys... who have been looting the University for the last twenty years... A policy which rewards work, production, honesty and solidarity. Not one that clings to the past but one that lends a hand to the future, because that's where we are going. A policy from our time and for our time, our own policy. Comrades! Twenty one years ago, on a day like this, on this same balcony and on a bright day as today, I talked to Argentine workers for the last time. It was then when I recommended them... to adjust their organizations, because difficult days were coming. I wasn't wrong... neither in the appreciation of the days to come... nor in the quality of the union's organization... that for the last twenty years... in spite of those fools who shout... Rucci, traitor, say hello to Vandor! I was saying that during twenty one years... union organizations have kept themselves firm, and now some fresh faced youths... want to get the credit away from those workers... who have fought for twenty years! That's why, comrades... I want this first meeting on Worker's day... to be a tribute to those organizations... and to those wise and sensible leaders... who have kept their organic strength... and have seen his leaders killed... and the killers have not been yet punished! Bravo! This old adversary says goodbye to a friend. Come here, play the role of Isabelita. That's why, this old adversary tells you: Mrs. President, all the Argentine Political Parties will be by your side, to defend and safeguard the peace... of all the Argentine people you are symbolizing. This old adversary says goodbye to a friend! Come on, Balbin! Come on! Everything at the last minute, we have to change everything, no way to do it. Well, you know what? Fuck you, Balbo. Hey, anything wrong? - Yes, guess what? Balbo won't come. - What? Yes, he doesn't want to be an official candidate until he talks to his people. I really don't know. He talked to me for an hour, - and I really want no more. - Wait. Is it for sure? No. The only thing that's for sure is that I told him to fuck off. So, if he had any doubts, now he has no more. I don't know what to do. We tell the people now? We tell them tomorrow? No, let me talk to Alberto. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Alberto, do you have a minute? - Yes. Listen to me. Balbo is not coming. - Yes, I know. - What? - I already know. - What do you mean? - Yes, he told me this morning. - Why didn't you tell me? It was not necessary. Anyway, he wasn't going to come. Are you kidding? What do we do tomorrow? What have to put it all up again! I can't believe it! - Calm down, Roque. - How can I calm down? How can he do something like this when we've been working like crazy? He's a son of a bitch! - He's going to quit his candidacy. - What? He can't do that to us. Yes, he can and he will do it. It's better for us. What do we do with all the meetings we had this week? He'll be at the meeting with the deans on Wednesday. He will give the speeches which were programmed for the University. We are going to close the deals with the rest of the teaching staff. At the middle of next month, when everybody is sure... that Balbo will be Vinas' rival in the next election, he's going to quit. Why? Because he's been appointed to work for the Federal Educational Board. In a couple of months it will be effective. Come, take a seat. The people from Nexo will offer Molteni the candidacy, but the deans won't accept it. They'll need an agreement so as not to break their front. I'm going to be that agreement. If we do things the right way... by the end of the year I can be the University's dean. Do you understand? Yes, I do. Have you known about this for long? - Yes, I have. - Why didn't you tell me before? I'm telling you now. You know more than everybody else. And what do we do now? Nothing at all. We are doing nothing. We're going to wait... for Balbo to quit and for them to offer me the candidacy. Then we'll have to work a lot. You own this property? - Yes, it's mine. I have the deed. - So you own it and have the deed. - Exactly. - Perfect. - Your full name? - Adelina Lima. Adelina... Four months went by. Roque does not study anymore. It's been almost a year since he's not attending classes. He makes his living by doing surveys for a research center. Somebody from the group got this job for him. The rest of the time, he works for Acevedo's candidacy. Everybody think of him as his right-hand man. However, things are not working according to the plan. Acevedo's strategy starts to show cracks, to find resistance and unexpected enemies. No plan is perfect, and suddenly, Acevedo starts to show weakness. Roque and all the members of the team... are working hard in order to build an election front... that will let them revert the voting and reach the dean's office. If we win, great! Let's go and win! But we must have a strategy. We must be clear about that. Even more if we know that Vinas can come and fuck us! And if this means that Alberto has to quit... and making up a negotiation with school, let's think about it. Excuse me. What are you saying, then? What I mean is we can't allow ourselves to have an epic defeat. Even more if we can negotiate with Vinas... which will allow us to... I don't know... some things with school... I mean... Let's come to terms with it, guys. If Alberto quits... Well, let's assume it in the best possible way, and that's it. - You want Alberto to quit? - No, no... It's not something I want, you understand? It's something that must be done. We have to be very objective about this. The figures we have today... show that poor Alberto can't reach the rectorship. The figures we have today? What are those figures? Look, Psychology and Pharmacy are with them. Med School too. Dentistry is still undecided, but it's almost the same. These four will support the Ministry. Do you think they'll leave Vinas alone? Lorenzo, these guys have been ruling for ten years. Do you want to give them one more period? Don't you realize the situation in what the University was in? The situation we ourselves are in, locked in the same chair for ten years? Fuck! I do insist with the same! This is not something that I want. Do you understand? It's simply about knowing... - if we'll win or lose the election. - Lose the election? Are you listening to yourself? You are the only one who speaks about defeat two weeks before the election! I think that it has nothing to do with this group! I think we still have a lot we can do, a lot to work on! Can't you see it? You are saying it! We still have two weeks! So what I say is, why can't we decide now? Shut up! I want to listen to Marisa now. I want to know the real figures. Marisa, have you talked to the Psychology students? - Yes, on Tuesday. - What did they say? They were thinking it over, they had some differences... but it was clear that the councilors would like to vote for us. Perfect! What do they say at FADU, Miguel? Nothing... We'll meet tomorrow, but I am friends with the councilor, and they won't vote for Vinas. Yes, I've just had a meeting with FADU students and they said the same. Well, perfect, and Dentistry is still undecided, so, why are we talking about defeat? For ten years we have been negotiating our defeats, and it's not about an epic defeat as you say... It's about cutting off this shitty circuit... in which our negotiations always end up with their victories! I don't know, I think every time an election comes... we're told to quit, to negotiate, that it will be better for us... I don't think that's the thing to do, because it led us to this! For eight years they have been involved in the rectorship... and we continue with this chair! - How was the meeting? - Complicated. I don't know... Paula's a little bit nervous, I think we're missing something. Why? It takes more than just Paula's enthusiasm. With her intolerance we are not going to win any election. - So, you agree with Lorenzo? - No. His proposal is madness. I think he's holding meetings to get inside Vinas' group. Don't listen to him. He's playing his game. Alberto, I think we should try to talk with the people we know are against us. See if we can fracture their agreements. - They called me, from the Ministry. - Who? Tapia, the crook. He wants a meeting. It seems they can get reach an agreement with Vinas and Pharmacy students. Vinas will give the labs to the Ministry, but doesn't want Pharmacy to be part of the action. Pharmacy won't vote then, and that could endanger the rest of the core votes. - He wants to test me. - Well, you must go. With those votes we'll win. Why didn't you say this at the meeting? Because I can't go to a meeting with the Ministry. We would lose all of our supporters. They'd think I'm handing Vinas the rectorship on a silver plate. Time is short for me to get involved in such a mess. I wouldn't know how to explain it. Those guys want to test me. They called me at the office, I didn't answer. - When did they call? - Yesterday afternoon. Alberto, you must go. With those votes, we can win. An agreement there is crucial, I can assure you. With those votes, we'll win. You said it. - Yes, that's true! - Yes. It's been a year of hard work. We busted our asses off. We can't let this one go by. We can get these guys out of the Rectorship once and for all. No Roque, I can't go to that meeting. It's not safe for me to go. What if I go? Could you make them see me? I'll go and I listen to them. See if they really mean what they say. Or if they only want to hurry Vinas into accepting the terms. Let's not discard possibilities before we listen to him. Okay, go to the meeting... but don't say anything. - Remain silent. - Okay. Just listen to them. Let them talk. Is that clear? You do realize this can play against us, don't you? Nobody must know about this. Roque... Not even Paula. Is that clear? Absolutely. Very clear. Nobody. Okay. Alberto... I know you've been talking to Lorenzo... about the issue of the secretariat... I'd really like to take that place. - You need to have a degree for that. - Yes, I know. But I thought I could ask Eugenio to stand in, until I get my degree. Then I can run the secretariat. That's fine, I'll consider it. Let's see how this rolls... - We'll talk in a couple of weeks, okay? - Okay. Here, call Federico. Tell him you want to see him. Hi, Federico. How are you, man? This is Roque Espinoza, how's it going? Good morning! I have a meeting on the seventh floor. - Right that way. - Excuse me. - Any weapons? - No, no. Okay, let me see. What do you have in your pocket? - My cigarettes, my lighter. - Okay, you may go. Thank you very much. - Hi. I go to the seventh floor. - Hi. - Are you Espinoza? - Yes. - Come with me - Hi, nice to meet you. - How are you? - Good, very good. I'm Guillermo Farrell, Ministry advisor. Have you been waiting long? No. I have wait longer for less important people than ministers... Anyway, the minister won't see you, he's very busy. - You are going to talk with me. - Excuse me. Hello. - From school, right? - Yes. - What year are you in? - Third. You know it's important for us to take part in this election. We think this election is very important and we want in. Of course, I understand. And we want Acevedo on our side. In fact, we want to help him. We have told him this many times, but he is not very interested apparently. Yes, he is interested. That's why I'm here. It's obvious now! He is running out of options. Without our support, it'll be difficult for him to win. Look, what we want you to tell him is this: We are going to be part of the election and we want him with us. Why not with Vinas? Because if we get in, we'll need some space. A lot of space. You know, people inside the teams, several secretariats, teaching positions and some other things. - What's the matter? You don't agree? - No, no... No, I'm not the one who must agree or not. I just feel at this point things are not getting easier. - Stay with your chair then. - No, no, no... I'll deliver the message. We'll discuss it and... You can talk it with whomever you like, but my cards are on the table... - They are pretty obvious. Aren't they? - They're not that obvious to me. Okay. I'll make them really obvious. Can you take notes? - I have a good memory. - Good. We want Extension and Academic secretariats. To be part of the call for title holder at Economics, Law and Engineering, and handle the issue... of the tender offer for the Labs. Okay? Okay. I see a chance for secretariats and title holders, but when we are so close to the election, I don't think it's time to discuss the Labs. It isn't? Why not? I just figured if I'm actually sitting here... Vinas is holding something from you. So don't try to rush me. Okay. Focus on the Labs. It's all we care about. - Okay, I'll tell him. - One more thing. This meeting was between us to. Okay? You and I. So from now on, I only speak to you. If this deal is closed, it'll be our deal. We are going to be partners, do you understand? Partners. If you can close this agreement, you'll be the only one responsible... for them winning this election. Is that clear? - The boss? - He's not here. - He told me to come. - He left five minutes ago. He forgot it. Hey, dude! Hello, guys! Everything okay? - Somebody was looking for you. - Who? - I don't know. - Okay, thanks. - Hi, beauty! - Roque, your dad's here. - Who? - Your dad! You two look alike. He's at the bar. - My dad's here? - Yes! ...his entire ethics system is frozen, by the impossibility of knowing the absolute. So, then... Remember that when the model becomes problematic... The way people should behave inside society... sorts matters out around these three questions we talked about. What can I do, what can I know, what can I wait for... You cannot be here! A person should hold to this questions... if he wants to be ethical... How come someone be mad for two completely different things? For her, it's the same if you eat or if you don't. She gets angry all the same. How can it be? You understand? How can it be that she wants to move three times a year? How is it possible that she fights with every single neighbor? Every single one! Hi! How are you? Is that you? Yes, I was at the office. Paula? She's here, with me. No, but the neighbors move... Maybe her phone's off. Sure, yes. We are here, downtown. At the canteen. Okay, come. Come here if you want. Okay. See you. He takes after her but just the good stuff... - Who was that? - Alberto. - What does he want? - Nothing. He's joining us. - He's coming? - Yes. What were you telling her? That you take after the best of your mom and the worst of me. This is the only place were you can eat decent pastries. Hey, Alberto, how are you? This is my dad. Nice to meet you. Ernesto Espinoza, Roque's father. Nice to meet you, too, Ernesto. Your son is a great assistant, a good friend. - Oh, good... - Hi. Progressive... Why don't you fucking stop talking about progressive? Sorry, I never mentioned this... Mister Espinoza here... was part of the Agrarian Youth. Really? It's good to know someone in the family was left wing. He spent only three months and left. - Agrarian Youth Front? - Yes. - Where? - In La Plata. - Oh! Very good! - Like the agrarian league from... - Chaco? - Chaco, exactly! We took it to Ameghino and then we moved it to the towns in the area. I was a close friend of Fernando Yanez. - Really? - Yes. - He was our man at La Plata. - Sure. - A very interesting guy. - Yes, yes. He was so smart... He had such a personality... such charisma... such beard! - We probably met at a gathering. - Probably! Excuse me... I'm not trying to cut short the activists talk... but let me tell you that my comrade Espinoza... spent only three months at the Youth. You are taking it too far... Well, what did you want me to do? At that time... not being a Peronist was not considered correct. During those three months we were all comrades. Why? Because it was in 1973, when Peron came back. It was then when I decided to go to the gathering at Ezeiza. - The day of the National Reunion. - Did you go? No, I didn't. But I remained glued to the radio all day long. - You didn't go? - No. Sixteen years exiled and you didn't go? Seventeen, and he could have stayed longer. We were two million people. Can you imagine... two million people chanting the song? - No. - Wait, wait. I didn't know about this. - Did you chant the Peronist song? - Just a little. - Really? - Yes. I didn't know all the lyrics, - But I sang parts. - Come on... How can't you not remember the lyrics? That's impossible! - What? You know it? - Of course! - All of it? - Sure! - I don't believe you. Sing! - No way! - Come on! - No way! - Any part you remember. - Let's make a duet, comrade. To the great Argentine... Who knew how to conquer... the common people... fighting capitalism... Peron, Peron! I was a Peronist for three hours! - Your girlfriend's very beautiful. - Yes! You liked her? - Yes, really. - Well, thanks, dad! Remember those hicks you used to date? Terrible! Who would have thought? - Insane now that I think about it! - You know how to get to the hotel? - Of course I know! - Yes? Sure? - Yes! Cut the crap, man! Cheers! - Hey, dad. Breakfast tomorrow? Give me the glass! You can't take the glass... - Do we have breakfast together tomorrow? - Yes, if I can wake up. Hey dad. It's trannie zone near the hotel. Be careful. They should be careful! Let's go, my friend... - Bye, dad! - Bye! - Your dad's nice. - You really think so? - Yes. - He was famous in Ameghino. - Why? - He picked up any girl he wanted. - Really? - Yes. My uncle always talks about the time he took him to a parade. It was full of floats. One of them from Buenos Aires... - Packed with artists from here. - Artists? Yes. Apparently he made out with the hottest one. - Who was she? Do you know her name? - Yes, Silvia Peiru. - Hey, not bad! - Silvia Peiru was really hot! He says everyone was horny for her. They all wanted to be with her. But... At last, she left with my old man. - Interesting! - He doesn't confirm of deny it anyway. - That's good! He's a gentleman! - Well, I like him even more, then. - Hey, come on now! - Okay, okay, okay! - I had my stories too! - You did? - Yes! - A famous one? - Yes, famous. - Who? - You want to know? - Yes! I made out with one of Las Primas. - What are you laughing at? - Bullshit! - Seriously. - You were too young when they sang. No! I was seventeen and the girl was twenty nine, thirty. - No, it can't be. - Yes. Not one of the original ones. One was Sandra Smith, the other one... I don't know... - That doesn't count then! - What do you mean it doesn't count? No! It was the replacement of the replacement! - Who do you have? - I have a true star. - Famous? - Famous! - Who is it? - Want to know? - Yes. - Manu Chao. - No, it can't be. - You don't know who he is? A singer. - Why not? - You made out with Manu Chao? - Yes, sir. - But when? How? I was in Barcelona with my cousin and I met him. He was staying in a house, and me too and well... - Did you fuck Manu Chao? - Something like that. Bullshit... Manu Chao... He was filthy anyway! You're jealous, I'm not jealous of your Prima at all! - Bye! - Bye! Regards to your dad! If you want to be elected you must be clear. Stay out there as a clear option. Speak up. Represent change. If we win, we'll do just the opposite the ones before us did. - That's how they'll understand. - Okay, but it's not that easy. Not everyone wants change or is willing to vote for change. - What about you? - What? Because now you'll tell me that you are the change, right? In relation to the previous administration, we clearly are. Sure! - Oh come on! Come on... - Wait a moment. Listen to me. I'm not going to tell you that these guys are wonderful, but, let's not exaggerate! They're far better than Vinas... I'm not sure. You might see the difference. I don't. - You can't see the difference? - No, I can't. - Do you want me to explain it to you? - Yes. - But you have to listen to me. Okay? - I'm listening. - If you pay attention I'll explain. - Sorry, man. It's not you, but they both are functional to the current situation. You know what happens? When you don't try to manage... It's very easy to talk. We all talk. Everyone... Oh! When you manage for your friends... I mean. Anyone can manage. Right? In the end, a new friend comes and manages for his other friends. - Hi, honey! - You manage today... Someone comes next... It's all the same. It's all about contacts, lobbying... Isn't it? This is the state our country is in. Hey, stop it! Calm down! - I just can believe it. - Can you calm down? - Are you crying? - No. I'm not crying... - Are you crying? - No. I'm not crying. I can't believe what happened. He fucked us. He fucked us. Yes... I don't know what you are talking about... It can't be. Hello. What's up? I called Alberto an hour ago. I called Lorenzo. No one's picking up. - They won't talk to you. - Why wouldn't they talk to me? - Because things are not looking good. - What's not looking good? - He fucked us. - How? You told me over the phone but I don't get it. How? Acevedo closed a deal with Vinas. They'll split the power between them. They're leaving us out. - When did this happen? - I guess yesterday. - Yesterday? Did you know? - No. - You knew. - I'm telling you I didn't. Tell me the truth, Paula. You knew. Are you asking me for the truth? Why did you meet that guy at the Ministry? Did you think it was so easy? - I went because Acevedo asked me. - C'mon, Roque! Negotiations had to be started. He couldn't afford to go. So I did. Do you know who that guy is? Why don't you find out first? - Acevedo wouldn't have cut the deal. - That's not what he told me. They were going to hand over the votes needed to win the election. - In exchange for what? - In exchange for winning the election! - We were in no shape to win! - Well, we lost! You and I lost. He is the only one who won. Acevedo needed Vinas to think he was negotiating with the ministry. That's why he sent you. Vinas got scared. He knew he needed those votes to win. He hurried to make a deal with Acevedo. They split secretariats amongst them, and leave the ministry out. And you are to blame for that meeting. As if it was your idea. Who was dealing with that? I don't know. Lorenzo was involved. But I didn't know you were too. I'm sorry. It's not me you have to say it to. You're a fool. - Here are the keys. - Thanks. So... Bye. Goodbye. Bye. Roque! Hold on. Roque. Wait. So... I wanted to say... I'm really sorry it ended this way. I think you are really cool. I know timing is shitty, but this will go by. Cool. Thanks. You did do some pretty stupid stuff! I know it's politics but... No one will remember it in three months. - You won't remember. - Yes, sure. Why don't you stay under the radar for some time? Shift your thoughts to studying, exams... I can guarantee... I can find a place for you once we get the rectorship. - Call me in a couple of months. Okay? - Sure. I'll call you in a couple of months. - Hello. - Hi there, cutie. - Yummy! What is it? - Steak creole. I'm so hungry. In 1987, Lisandro de la Torre, a politician, leaves the Radical Civic Union. He accuses Hipolito Irigoyen, one of the Buenos Aires leaders, of a conspiratorial and hostile attitude. Of putting his personal interests before the party and the nation ones. Irigoyen challenges him in duel, leaving for his rival the choice of weapons. De la Torre, an expert at fencing, chooses the sword. The duel leaves Lisandro de la Torre with a scar in his cheek. Since then, and for that reason, he always grew a beard. - What's this? - I got it today. Octavio gave it to me this afternoon. - How did he get it? - He wouldn't say. It's dated and has the official documents, plus the list of Labs. Perfect. This is what we needed. - Are you going now? - Yes. - Bye. - I hope it goes well. - Call me. - Okay. - Did you see Jauregui? - He's up there. - Hi. - Hi there. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for Jauregui. - I'll tell him to call you... - It's just a second... No, Roque! We need to go. - Hello. - Hi there, Roque. - Can I talk with you for a minute? - Go away, you son of a bitch. It's an important matter. I need to talk to you. - There's nothing to talk to you, man! - Wait! Let me speak. - I'm listening. - Go away, man! - Horacio... - Stay out of this, Vale! These are the dates. The official tender documents, and who are going to take part of it. They used this to get the votes they were missing. As soon as they can control the office they'll start the tender process. - Where did you get it from? - A friend who's still in. - Is this for real? Are you sure? - It's real. He could be cheating you too. Does it matter if it's true or if it's of any use? We can stall the election. That has to happen. You have to vote and he has to win. - There's nothing to do tomorrow. - This is bullshit! - Let him speak. - Listen. Tomorrow the police will be there. With the hydrants, the horses... The election can't be stalled. How many people will you take? A hundred? Two hundred? You can't make it. They'll gas you. You can't fight them. - We'll go anyway. - Yes. I know that. You have to go and demonstrate. Have things go the way they want. They shouldn't see it coming. But in the meantime, another group has to take over the rectorship. - How do we do that? - It can be arranged. Today we rise one more time! We rise! To avoid, fellow students! To avoid... the looting and undermining of our university! This morning, several students interrupted the council reunion, to protest about the election of the new Rectorship. They took over the building and claim for the dismissal of the council. - Eugenio. - Hi there, man. - Hello. - Hi there. Alberto? - He is busy. - Oh. Okay. - It's you! - Lorenzo... - How do you do? - How are you, man? Keep me posted about that meeting anyway... - What's up? - Nothing's up... - See you. - Sure. - Aberto... - Roque Espinoza. How are you doing? - Everything okay? - Doing just fine. - Did you hear about the mess? - I watched the news. It's Cortigiani. Arrange for tomorrow. Cortigiani... It's good you came. - Yes. Why wouldn't I come? - Go ahead. - Anything to drink? - Is this one working? Yes. There you have the mate and the kettle... - How is everything going? - Kind of complicated... When did you learn? I was at lunch with Hipolito when they told me. We were visiting the Basque with his partners. Hipolito had made arrangements. He was even happier than me. He wouldn't allow us to order. He asked for something special for each of us. And three bottles of wine. His choice. He really likes scandal! - He is full of himself. - His belly might be full! Before the food arrived, they called me to tell me about the takeover. Do you know what the son of a bitch did? - He started laughing out loud. - He laughed? Yes. Everyone stared at him. He started mocking us as if he was a kid. Were you able to eat at least? I ate some... - It's a fine place to eat out. - I know. I was there with you once. - Yes, Paula was there... - You, Paula, Marisa and Lorenzo. After the election on 2009. - The time they threw us out. - They didn't throw us out. The place was closing. You were drunk and said they wanted to throw you out. - How is Paula doing? - She is just fine. - You are still together? - Yes. So far... Until she leaves me... - What is she doing? - She's back at the CONICET... She got a position at La Plata and Quilmes. - Just that. Teaching... - Good. - Did she send regards? - No. I didn't tell her I was coming. - Why not? - She is kind of mad at you. - She's still mad... - She is. You know Paula. She is resentful. I know we should have spoken before. But you know how it works. I'm still uneasy since what happened with Farrell. That guy is a motherfucker. It seems so... But it was a risk we had to take. We played to the limits on both sides. We wouldn't have won if not. That's the truth. I know the stakes were high for you. I know that perfectly. But this is politics. It was what we needed to do. I understand. Politics. - How are you doing? - Good. Good. Still doing surveys... Studying... Giving a couple of exams... Fine. I'm happy. - You're still mad? - No. I don't get mad. It's not worth it. Yes. It's not worth it. You know something? Apparently they found a guy who's over 150 years old. At Tucuman. In the forest. A weird case. The guy was lucid. His intellectual skills were intact. As if a young man. In no time, the media was there, doctors, psychologists, neurologists... Everyone wanted to know what he had done. How on earth he lived so many years and still was lucid. So they asked him: Sir? What's your secret? How did you make it? The guy didn't know what to say. Later, the guy came up with something that could work. The secret is to never argue. That was how my life was like. I never argued. I never disagreed. Everyone was upset. Never? That can't be possible! So the old man thinks for a moment and says: You're right. It's impossible! He agreed with them! Listen, Roque... It looks as if the takeover is going to last. I have three days to come up with something. It's tough. They don't want to negotiate. All they want is the statute to be reformed. Now they are denouncing something about the Labs... Bullshit, just bullshit... They say Farrell can be behind this. It's possible the son of a bitch is setting all this up. He wasn't too pleased with my election. They are asking for the Ministry to mediate. And if they let them in, they will use it to take me out. After all our hard work... So I need you to help me solve this. You'll have the secretariat you wanted. You'll be Eugenio's supervisor. I'd like for you to take care of coordinating... the student centers. Do you understand? If everything works fine... I'll be part of the National campaign next year. Plenty of work for us. Touring, groupings... Organization of the technical crews... I want you in. I want you to be part of this with us. You know that if the numbers are on our side... we'll play hardball out of the University. But pay attention... First we need to finish the takeover. I want them out of the building by tomorrow afternoon. Can I count on you? No.
