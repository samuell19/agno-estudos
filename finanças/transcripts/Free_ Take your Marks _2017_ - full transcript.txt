Okay. Breakfast is ready. - Okay. - You're not eating? It'll get cold. Yeah. What? Haru? Wait! What? Wait! Haru! What... What was that dream? Are you okay, Makoto? Thanks, little Haru. Drop the word "little", will you? Let's get on the train first. Okay. Let's go, Haru. We need to find a place for you. Yeah. Part One: Fateful Choice What? Haru hasn't decided on a place to live in Tokyo yet? Yeah. Mako chose a place right after his acceptance. He already has a place but he still went with Haru? Yeah, he went since he has to pick up his apartment keys. Brother, can you still help out with the video for the club invitation? Gou, you're there too? Gou? I'm here too. For the Iwatobi Swim Club special spring training. Gou! Kamakiri and Tagame, which is better? Kamakiri. What are you doing, Momo? Rin, you're so mean. I can help with the video. I have a meeting with Ai, so I only have one day. Thank you! And tell Haru, that he just needs a place to sleep. So hurry up and choose a place. What? You can't even sleep when your pillow changes. Ai, starting tomorrow, Momo's training will be Hell No. 33. What? Big brother's Hell No. 33? Anything but that... Shut up! I bet they have intensive training. Yes, we have to keep up with them. Let's try out the special training menu that Gou made for us yesterday. Yes! I want to work on increasing... Is Haruka in Tokyo now? We've only just graduated but it feels like we've travelled to a faraway place. Tokyo is not that far. Rin is heading to Australia too. He's trying to go even farther. I need to find a place to live soon. Yeah. We need to find a place by tomorrow. Yeah. You don't have to worry. They'll find a place to live since I've introduced them to a real estate agent. You did, Coach Sasabe? Teacher Amakata must know a lot about Tokyo too. - Oh? - Right. Ama used to work at a swimwear company in Tokyo. Well... yes... You must have a lot of nice memories in Tokyo. Y-Yes... Memories in Tokyo, as the saying goes reality falls short of the fame. A dry town, concrete jungle the town is crying but even those tears will be dried in the Tokyo desert. Teacher Amakata, are you okay? Coach Sasabe, how do you know of a real estate agent in Tokyo? Well, the truth is a relative of my student at the club is a real estate agent in Tokyo. That's all. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, look who's here. Hayato! Shigino Real Estate What kind of person is Kisumi's uncle? If they're alike, I'm leaving. Excuse me. Welcome. - They're twins! - We're leaving. Haru, wait a second! Hey there, Makoto and Haru! Kisumi? Why are you here? - I'm leaving. - Just hold on! Didn't I tell you? No. I'm going to a University in Tokyo, so I'll be staying with my uncle. My things are arriving today. I see. Hey. It's Haruka and Makoto. I've heard about you guys. Welcome to Tokyo, the big city swirling with love and hope. And welcome to my office that's swirling with love and ambition. This is Katsumi. Hello. I've picked out some great places, so don't you worry. Kisumi, you show them the place. Okay. You got your driver's license? And you, Makoto? I was busy with my entrance exams. But Haru, you got yours, right? Yeah. You got your driver's license, but you don't have a place to live. That's so you, Haru. - Shut up. - Look, we can see it now. That's the first place I'm showing you. It's a little old but it's a good place close to the station. What do you think, Haru? The bath is small. Well, it's a modular bath. Bath is important to Haru. How about this place? It's farther from the station but it's a relatively new place. The bath is spacious and clean. What do you think? The kitchen is nice too. It has a new stovetop. I want a grill for my fish. You can grill with this too. Then, how about this place? It's spacious, clean and with a great view. Lots of windows a grill on the stovetop and it has a dishwasher. The bath has a re-heating feature, and look at this price. Wow! Why is it this cheap? Well... it's a stigmatised property. Stigmatised property? Then that means... Yes, there was an accident here. Last month, the tenant here... Don't tell us. Haru, this is a bad place. You worry too much. No. This is definitely a bad place. Why would you care? Haru's the one who'll live here. But it'll be scary when I come over. You guys are sure close. No, not really. You're so picky, Haru. You only specified the rent, and for it to be close to the station. Uncle Katsumi did his best to pick out these places. I know that. Your uncle seems like a fun person. You can tell? Every time he sees me... We'd say "kiss me" or "catch me" to each other. "Catch me" is a wordplay with his name, Katsumi. This is the other available room. Take a look. The bath and toilet are separated here. It has a gas stovetop too. Looks nice. I have to see it. Right. But we can't go there yet. The house is ready but we haven't gotten the keys back yet. Oh, it's Uncle. What? Already? Sorry, the movers are here. They're here earlier than scheduled. I have to go. It's my treat. You can stay here and relax. Really? It's for work anyway. It's what they call expense. Bye. Expense, huh? He's all grown up, and seems like a local here. I wonder if we'll be like that too. Yeah. Take Your Marks. What should we do now? I want to take a look at this place. Okay. Let's go. It's good to check the surroundings. Mako, how's house hunting? We're still looking. How're things there? Rin is going to help us with the club introduction video. That's great. How's practice? It's going smoothly. We tried out the new training menu at the swim club and now we're having a meeting over lunch. Meeting? About what to do for the welcoming event for the new students. Remember how we showed off our muscles last year? Our muscles were the main attraction then so we plan to change it up this year. Our plan is to do the butterfly on stage to showcase the popular dorsi muscle. Can you swim the butterfly on stage? Yes, that's why... Sorry, the train is here. I'll send you the movie we just took. I hope you find a good place. According to the theory of house hunting... Nagisa, hold on! Okay Mako, say hi to Haru. Okay. Bye. I see. The butterfly is possible on stage in this way... Oh no! What are they doing? We have to work hard too. It's a ten-minute walk from here. - This way? - I think so. It's a beautiful place. Yeah. Isn't that it? I think so. I'm glad it was easy to find. This park looks similar to the one near Iwatobi elementary. The place where you fell from the bars? Yeah, that same park! It's this room. There's no nameplate. Maybe they moved out already. Is that building... Looks like a pool. With a pool close by it's a perfect place for you, Haru. If you live here, you can go swim any time you want. No thanks, I can just swim at the university. Hey. Were you guys trying to get into this apartment? Well... Are you Coach's friend? Coach? It's cleared up. Sosuke, you're not packing yet? I'm going to stay a little longer. Rin, you're going back home before heading to Australia, right? Yeah. To see my mom. I want to go to your house too. When you get back home, are you top? Or are you bottom? What do you mean? You know, when you share the bunk bed with Gou. Who's on the top and bottom? We don't have bunk beds. - How boring. - Momo! Don't add your beetle books here! It's a present for Gou. And it's a set of five books! - Sosuke. - Okay. I'll give them as presents to my relatives who love insects. No, I like them better. Gou must be happy to be able to spend time with you even if it's a short while. But you might be the happiest. - Right, Rin? - Shut up. Shut up and help me out. Your coach used to live there? Yeah. He was a coach at the community pool. He quit while I was on a sick break. I wonder what happened to him? I don't know. But I wanted to get better. He said that he would teach me how to swim faster. Why do you want to swim faster? I don't want to lose to him. Him? He was in my class. He moved away last winter. He was so fast. I've never won against him. I want to compete with him and win the next time. I promised him. To meet at a swimming competition. So that we can swim together. What's your name? Kuramoto Misaki. Alright. I'm Tachibana Makoto. - And he's... - Nanase Haruka. Misaki, are you headed to the swim club? Yeah, because I want to be faster. What style do you swim? Me? I swim the freestyle. I'm going to be number one in freestyle. Misaki, can we come to the pool too? He's a little rough around the edges, but he swims really well. He must have had a good coach. - Good job. You have the basics down. - Okay. But you're exerting too much strength which affects your form. You recover quickly, but don't bend your elbows underwater. - Like this? - Yeah. Yes, naturally. Who is that? Look at him swim. Wow. Do you know him, Misaki? What a beautiful crawl. Who are you guys? I hope we can swim together. Along with your friend that moved away. Yeah. Brother! You're early. I finished shopping earlier than I expected. I bought a cake that's not too sweet. Today's dinner is your favourite, meat. Mom was so excited. She has gone overboard. Because it's been a while. And you're leaving for Australia right after. So it's okay to go overboard. Did you move out completely? Yeah. By the way, did you hear from Haru? Did he find a place to live? If you're that worried, you should call him yourself. I'm not that worried. It must be okay if Makoto is with him. Yeah. I'll be lonely. What? Everyone is leaving, one after another. What're you saying? We're not leaving. We're going on an adventure. No matter where we are, our hearts are one. Stronger than ever. What? You're trying to be cool. Shut up. Come in, Haru. This is my new place. I don't have anything yet but let's take a break here. Okay. I have to buy curtains. - You'll be busy. - Yeah. - Hey Haru. - What? I was a little worried today. If I can really live in the city, it's all so new to me. But when I was at the pool, and teaching Misaki it really made me want to teach and show more kids how fun it is to swim. You once told me, Makoto is Makoto. I don't know how far I can go but I want to do all that I can in this city. Yeah. And Misaki reminded me of Rin when he was young. It gave me motivation. Rin wasn't that honest. You're right. Shigino Katsumi Here. This is your key. It hasn't been cleaned yet, but you should be able to take a look. Thank you. I heard that the last tenant was a swimming coach. What was he like? Coaching was a part-time job since he was a student. When he left his keys, he forgot his cell phone here. He just called and said he'd come and get it soon. If you wait, I'm sure you can meet him. - Do you want to meet him? - It's okay. Alright. Kisumi is away, so do you want to take a look at the room on your own? I'll lend you my car. There're so many cars in Tokyo. Are you okay, Makoto? I'm a little nervous... Haru, look ahead! You're amazing, Haru. It'll take me time to get used to this. This place is so clean. We can tell the personality of the person who lived here. Yeah. I choose this place. If the last tenant was a swimming coach I wonder if he had experience. I wonder. Excuse me. I'm the one who called about a mobile phone I left behind. Oh yes. Here. Good. I thought I lost it. Come here if you ever need help. Serizawa. Thank you. Brother! Do you need help unpacking? No. The rest are stuff I'm taking to Australia. Steve, you got even fatter. You're so unfriendly. Rin, Gou, the tea is ready. Japanese tea with cake? It goes well together. Cake and roasted green tea. Yes, it's our trend these days. Right? It's delicious. Can I have another one? You'll end up like Steve, is that okay? I won't! I'll eat it! - Really? You'll be like Steve. - No... Part Two: Cooling Down at a Secluded Hot Spring - That concludes today's training. - Yes. Tomorrow's morning practice starts at seven. Please review your training program. That's it. Thank you. Ai, you've really become like a captain. You were so cool. No. Not really. I'm only the acting captain for now. That's not true. You're our next captain, Ai. Thanks, Momo. But... What is it? I want to give something to Rin and Sosuke for their graduation. As a team who swam the relay together. I see. A present, huh? The newest swimwear? Or goggles? Those are nice too. But something more surprising and... Then how about that? Beetle raising kit! It's not about what you want, Momo. It's about Rin. Wait, Momo! Welcome. You get one try per five lottery tickets. Ai, do you have any lottery tickets? I have some that I got when I did some shopping. But the beetle kit... Don't worry. Today's my lucky day. I got seven points on my test! It's lucky seven! Seven upon? Hundred. - Here you go. - Right, please proceed. Beetle raising kit! I lost! Congratulations! You've won first prize. Hot spring voucher for two. Hot spring? This is it, Momo! What? What should we do for White Day? What to do? I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day! I have to start packing. Even if we didn't get anything, we can give something to the girls. That's the one and only way we can do it since we're in an all-boys school. Hey. Hey, Yamazaki. Hello. Did anyone leave this in my room by mistake? Cookies! Who are they from? I don't know. Wait. Let me see this. There're letters on it. Is it some kind of a message? That's it! He's going to be so surprised! After he solves this quiz, he'll be on a hot spring vacation. Mechanical salmon roe! "Mechanical salmon roe is inside the morning..." Morning crabs? It's all about mechanical salmon roe. What's that anyway? What do you mean? It's mechanical salmon roe! Who cares what it is! Mechanical salmon roe? That sounds so cool! Momo, why are you amazed by it? They've got it all wrong. What's the point if they can't assemble it? Sosuke. I heard all about it! Please leave it to me. This is probably it! The treasure is inside the mouth of the red shark. The treasure is inside the mouth of the red shark? It's a message that leads us to the treasure? But what's the red shark? There's a person named Akai in the Judo Club. Bring him. Wait. Then the treasure is in his mouth? The mechanical salmon roe? Oh, could the shark be the statue of the shark in the courtyard? Was there such a thing? But it's not red. Well, let's just go. Look over there. The shark has turned red due to the sunset. The treasure is inside his mouth. There's nothing there. Is that it? Oh, in the shadow. You're smart, Yamazaki. Hot spring voucher for two. Congratulations. What is this? Ai and I won that with our lottery tickets. Please use them. Okay. So, what do you want to do? Anago hot spring? I guess we should go. But I feel bad that we're the only ones going. We have vouchers for Anago hot spring as well. The newspaper company gave it to us. Here. You should take the other students with you. Hot spring! Tatami! Hot spring! Calm down, Momo. It's no time to be calm. Let's go sightseeing! I wonder if I can see a capybara. I want to take a picture with a capybara and show it to my brother. Let's go. Momo, we'll take a picture for you if we see a capybara. Yay! This hot spring bun is so delicious. How many have you eaten? Momo, it's a capybara. Really? Rin, please take a picture. Come here, Ai. Hurry up. Ready? Say cheese. Next is Rin and Sosuke. Come on. Hurry up. Stop it, Momo. We might as well take it. Okay. Sosuke, relax. Smile! Ready? - Say cheese. - Stop it. - Okay. - Stop it. That hurts. This wooden sword is so cool! Hey, Momo we were supposed to let them enjoy this trip but we're the one enjoying it instead. So we should give them some kind of a present. How about this wooden sword for Rin? That doesn't suit Rin... Why? I got a boomerang as a souvenir from Australia. This wooden sword would be a great gift. Let's not decide on that yet. Then I'll get this for Gou. Will she like it? What's that there? It's Capybara. Rin, take a picture for me. Hold on, Momo. Momo is having lots of fun. Yes. Capybara was so cute. That's... Those are familiar faces. Sofu-kan High School Swim Club. They're always in the Nationals. Is it a training camp? I'll go take a look. Stop it, Momo. First, put away that sword. Hey. If you're done with roll call, go to the lobby. - You'll get in the way here. - Okay. Take Your Marks. Hey, how's the preparation for the video? Is there anything we can help with? Haru, Mako! We brought snacks. Thank you. Rin isn't coming? He went to the hot spring with Sosuke and the rest. Hot spring? Why? Nitori gave it to them as a graduation gift as a surprise. Wow, Ai is amazing. Nagisa, we should give our seniors a surprise gift too. You can't say that in front of them. Oh no! Thank you. But we also want to do something for Rin before he goes to Australia. Surprise. Oh, it's Iwatobi! It's the limited edition mackerel miso cream. Thank you very much. Let's take a break for now. I want strawberry milk. I'll have barley tea. It looks delicious! Let's eat. Oh, before we eat I'd like to say a word. This trip was for us to thank Rin and Sosuke but you invited us instead. Thank you very much. I'm so happy that we were able to travel together like this as a team of four. It's an awesome memory. No need to stand on ceremony, Ai. I'd like to say a word too. - Ai. - Yes. Right now, you're a fill-in but you're an official captain from April. I'm counting on you. Yes. Thank you. I will do my best to take after you, Rin. Ai, you're being too formal. Let's end this formality and eat. Yes, but let's do cheers before we eat. Thank you, Rin, Sosuke. Cheers! Excuse me. Where's Momo? He got excited and ate too much. So he's going to rest first. Where's Rin? He left already. He seems to be enjoying this trip. I'm glad that you're enjoying this trip too. I've only been thinking of swimming. It's nice to spend a relaxing time with friends. This trip is not only for Rin, but we want to show our gratitude for Sosuke too. So I'm glad you're enjoying it. Why are you so formal? If you give your best, you can swim again. Don't minimise your potential. I came this far because of your encouraging words. I want to share so many things with everyone. So even if you graduate, please come and visit Samezuka. And please train us. Sure. Ai, how dare you leave me behind! I'm sorry. You're... Yes. First-year student in Samezuka Academy Mikoshiba Momotaro. The sea of Japan's sea otter! First-year student, Sofu-kan High School Swim Club, Usami Aoba. I'm the Capybara of the rapid stream! Capybara? Listen, that capybara stuffed animal you had. I was eyeing that too. Too bad. That was the last one. Give it to me. It's first come first serve. What'd you say? That was a nice bath. What? What are you doing, Momo? Ai, good timing. I'm going to compete against this Capybara of the rapid stream. Momo! What happened? Usami is going to compete against someone in Samezuka. Really? Compete? Damn. I wasn't watching over them. Chance! Wow! Amazing. Ai! Damn. One more time. They had me worried. Wait, Momo. You swim too, right? You're in Samezuka? I'm a Sofu-kan alumnus. Seems like our students are being a bother. You hurt your shoulder? I practised too hard. So I used to swim, but not anymore. My friend hurt his eye and he distanced himself from swimming. Now, he's studying sports medicine at a university. To him, being in the world of swimming is not only by being an athlete. But, I'd love to swim with him again. I'm sorry. It had nothing to do with you. Take it easy. You can't sleep? Yeah. You too. Ai, that capybara is mine. How much does he like capybara? This was fun. It's good to do things like this once in a while. I was able to make good memories before leaving for Australia. We have to thank Ai and Momo. - Hey Sosuke. - What? What are you... This isn't capybara. It's alpaca! What kind of dream is that? What were you saying? It's nothing. Let's wake up early and go soak in the hot spring. Good night. Good night. That was fun. Let's do that again. Somewhere with an alpaca. Go to the zoo. I just remembered. I saw an alpaca in my dream. Oh, it's a shrine. Let's stop by. Okay. They have good luck charms! Let's buy something. There are so many varieties. Will you buy one, Sosuke? No. Oh yeah. Let's give these charms as our gift to them. That's a good idea, Momo. Ai, you choose Rin's. I'll choose Sosuke's. Okay. Rin, this is for you. Thanks, Ai. This is for you, Sosuke. Thank you. Victory Four days until the film shoot Oh no. This is never-ending. I want Rin to wear this too. Rin is busy right now. Yeah, he's at Samezuka today. Oh, really? He didn't move out yet? He's helping Sosuke move. You got a lot of stuff, huh? Yeah. And this? A mechanical salmon roe from Uozumi. What is that? It turns into a salmon. I see. What's wrong, Sosuke? Nothing. I have to win. I finally found it. This is the legendary magic lamp. As long as I have this... I will grant you any wish. We want a lot of new students to join our club. Your wish has been heard. And so, we'll be waiting for a lot of newcomers. No one is coming. Why? Why? Huh? What a horrible dream. Stop it, Rei. That's not Iwatobi bread, but regular bread. Nagisa. Haruka will be coming soon to pick us up. Good morning, Makoto. Good morning, Rei. We're almost there. How're things? Are you ready? Yes, we're all ready. All ready. Part Three: Butterfly of Promise Where should I pack this? Into Ms Amakata's car, please. Got it. This can be in Rin's car? Yes. Wow, this is Rin's car? Not mine. It's my mom's. How cool! Rin and Ms. Amakata, thank you for coming so early. Don't worry about me, since I'm the teacher. There's a famous saying that goes "One has not lived in vain if he dies after he is told of the true path." That sounds amazing. You're a good driver, Rin. I'm better. Oh, really? Skill-wise, I'm definitely better than you. No, I'm better. Well, well... I think you're both good. It was nice that you got to drive in Tokyo, Haru. There were more cars compared to here but it was nothing special. Haru... What's Tokyo? I'm going to be driving in Australia. Wow. Matsuoka is a good driver. These are on rental, so please be careful. I'm sorry. My brother drives better than our teacher. Kurotori Dunes Parking Wow. I can't believe you made these. Since this will air at the member welcoming stage. You're excited about it. Are you okay, Rei? Nothing. Rei, are you... worried about your dream? Dream? He got a dream where we didn't get a single new member. Rei is feeling pressured. Stop being ridiculous. A dream? Why would I believe in something so illogical? Now, let's start with an explanation of the Iwatobi Swim Club Introduction stage. First, we start with Rei swimming up on stage. Then a big wave comes and hits him. Then Rei gets taken to a world of the Arabian night. That's when this movie will be played. That's very detailed. It's a combination of a live performance and a movie. It's a bold yet aggressive performance. And... I'm a mysterious peddler that guides Rei in the desert. I'm the evil king that is trying to get the magic lamp. And I'm the genie in the lamp. We were going to ask Coach Sasabe but he was busy. Nagisa, you can't bring out the intensity of a genie. That's not true. If I put on a fake moustache... - Look! - Is that so? Rin, you should make a guest appearance too. We have your costume. I won't do it. It'll be bad if I'm in the video for the Iwatobi club member video. Why? I promised I'll only help with the moving. You're leaving already? I have a meeting with Ai about handing over the duties of captain. By the time filming ends the train and bus services will still be running. Thanks for helping, Rin. You were a big help. Thank you. Sure. Rin. Come and visit us again. That looks good on all of you. Bye. Best of luck. Okay. Ready, action! Where am I? Since my butterfly was so beautiful I flew into an unknown world. Cut! Rei is good. He's perfect. Rei is amazing. I can't believe it's his first time. But... his skin isn't glowing. He needs more oil. He needs the silver reflector. Silver reflector? Well... that reflector there. As expected, Ms. Amakata. You searched up such technical terms for this film shoot? Then we should go along with that and film with our perfect acting skills. Okay. - Use this oil... - I already put some on. That's too much! It's not beautiful. Hey, stay still. Here you go. - Rub it in. - That tickles! In the next scene, Ryugazaki Rei will be wandering the Arabian night and meet the mysterious peddler Haruka. "Inside the bag of the mysterious peddler..." Haruka, we're running out of time, so we'll start. Okay. Ready, start. Who are you? I'm the mysterious peddler carrying a mysterious package. This is my mysterious partner. Chappy, the camel. Cut! Haru, your acting is very natural. "Mysterious peddler..." The next scene is with Makoto. Inside the mysterious peddler's mysterious package is the magic lamp with a genie. I will get it, no matter what! Cut! I can't do it. Makoto, relax! Makoto, write "mackerel" on your hand and lick it. How do I write that? You're supposed to write "human". What? Wasn't it "pumpkin"? Why would it be "pumpkin"? Okay, Ai let's start going over the duties of a captain. Yes, thank you very much. First, let's review the practice plan for the newcomers. Okay. What is this? That's a "Lucky Set". It comes with a prize. I was told the set is a better deal. It's something Momo would like. Yeah, Momo would... Momo? I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else. What's wrong, Asahi? Nothing. Sorry. Why are you in Tokyo? I told you I'd be back in March. What? March? The email said May. Really? Was it a typo? I did think the timing was strange. Kisumi, you... If you thought so, then tell me! I brought a lot of souvenirs for you. Delicious! Thank you so much for bringing us this delicious lunch. No worries. Delicious lunch makes the filming procedure a lot more fun. It would've been perfect if we had Gou's cocoa-flavoured protein rice balls. I wanted to make it, but I didn't have the ingredients. Well, the filming ended with success and the lunch is delicious. I'm sure that we will have loads of newcomers applying for our club! Nagisa Gou we still have more work left but let's work hard for our new members. Let's work hard. Yes! Take Your Marks. AV Room As long as I have this... I am the genie in the lamp. Are you the one that has called me? The mysterious peddler... Rei, you're such a good actor! Nagisa, you played the genie very well too. Because of the moustache. But... something is missing. You think so too? You thought so too, Rei? Yes. For an amateur-produced video I think it's very well done, but it feels like... we're missing something important. Ouch. Wow! Something missing. Should we talk about it with Mako and Haru? No. We can't always be relying on them for help. We have to learn to stand on our own two feet. Otherwise, they won't be able to leave for Tokyo without worrying about us. But what should we do? Just make sure not to give up. Do whatever you can. No matter how stupid it is you have to take the challenge as long as the possibility exists. You're going to Tokyo right now? I'm going to deliver the gifts to his house. Kibidango? It expires today! I can't think of anything. Yeah. Rei, Nagisa! Gou? I found something amazing. Look at this! An old Iwatobi Swim Club new members recruiting handbook. What's amazing about this? Don't be shocked. I checked the history of the swim club in the staff room. The number of new members in the year this handbook was made was a record high, with 30 students. 30? The recruitment method is written in here. Let me see! What's this PKH East Strategy? It makes you wonder, right? Yes, what's the strategy? That's... unfortunately... What? We don't know? Isn't this pointless? But they have all the other information. - So maybe it can help us... - Just make sure not to give up. But buying ice cream is a little cheap. I would be happy. That's great! This is interesting. Together, let's find that missing page. You're more enthusiastic than usual. We must do whatever we can! No matter how stupid it is, as long as the possibility remains it's important to take the challenge. I don't know. This is before my time. I see. But I think I've heard of this PKH East before. Really? But what was it... Please try to remember! Coach Sasabe, the equipment arrived. Okay, I'm coming. I'll call you when I remember anything. See you later. PKH East... PKH. Is that swimming terminology? I've never heard of it. Then is it a soccer term? Or baseball? This is not getting us anywhere. Tomorrow, let's search the club room from corner to corner in order to find the missing page. - Right! - Yes! Let's move out all the storage tomorrow! Let's all work hard! Yes! Nothing here. Maybe we can't find it. It's the last two boxes. This is it? There's one more room we haven't checked yet. Okay, let's get started. What're you doing? Haru, Mako! We're searching for something. What are you two doing? Nothing important. Do you need any help? No, it's okay. We can't be bothering the two of you. Nagisa, Rei! Haruka and Makoto too. What's up, Gou? New information! According to old records, the club had too many members that they had another club room! Really? Okay! Let's go take a look! This room hasn't been in use for over ten years. Are you ready? I'll open it. Mako, are you worried about Rei? You noticed? Ever since the filming Haru and I noticed that he was not being himself. So we came to check on him. But I see... Rei is searching for this missing page? Normally, Rei would pass this off as something stupid. He's frantic right now. If, like in his dream, there are no recruits then this swim club that we revived will disappear once more. But don't you worry! Gou and I are here too! You're right. This is... There are names on them. I supposed they are swimming caps? This is the training menu from back then. It's filled. Everyone was working hard. They had more members than us and everyone must have trained their hardest working towards the competitions. Win the battle against yourself! Coach Sasabe. I remembered it! It wasn't East, it's Azuma. PKH was perfect, muscle and handsome. That's what it stood for. There used to be a guy named Azuma in the club who was handsome and with the perfect physique. Found it. It was this year. This is Azuma? Yes, those muscles are really perfect. So the PKH Azuma strategy was to basically use Azuma to recruit a lot of new female members? Yes, more than half of them are female. Since they're in their uniforms they were all managers? What? That's what the PKH strategy was? It was a waste of time. No, it's not a waste. You should try that strategy too. I see. PKH Rei strategy. I won't do it! Rei can't be called a PKH. That's mean, Gou! Hey everyone, since we're all here, let's clean up this club room. It's a little early, but let's clean the pool too. Okay. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I was remembering when I first joined. I wanted to swim freely and beautifully like Haruka. That's why I joined. And now, you're free. Yes. Oh, this is the Iwatobi mascot that Haru made. We still had some left! I have more at home too. Should we pass them out to everyone this year too? What's the matter? Is that... Yeah. Let's take a look at it. How nostalgic. Everyone was working so hard. This was right before the competition. I bet the club members before us were training very hard like this. Win the battle against yourself! And now, we're also... Nagisa! I think I know... what we were missing. Let's make the final edits to the video. Okay! It's almost complete, Rei! Then should we have a viewing party? Inside the pool. What do you say? I am the genie in the lamp. Are you the one that has called me? The mysterious peddler was telling the truth? What is your wish? We'd like to have a lot of new members. And just as we have built a bond with our seniors we want to build a bond with the new members and that will carry on into the future. May that bond continue to be passed on forever. Your wish is granted. We added on that last line by Rei. That was wonderful. Good job, everyone. Nagisa Rei Gou as long as you three are here, Iwatobi Swim Club will be okay. Makoto and I can graduate without worries. - Yes! - Leave it to us! Rei! We're counting on you, Captain. Yes! The main event hasn't started yet. I'm getting nervous. Why are you already nervous? I know. That's so you, Gou. Because we might get a new member with beautiful muscles! I'm sorry for also quitting the club. It's not your fault, Makoto. Take care of your sisters. Yeah. Thanks. But I'm still sorry. The competition was close, but the team disbanded. It was sudden for Asahi too and Haru... What happened? I thought I knew Haru but I didn't know anything at all. Makoto, I'm going to follow my brother and go to America. What? I want to swim a lot more. I want to become faster. I didn't expect to love swimming in competitions this much. Ikuya... So make sure to tell Haru. Definitely... For sure, let's meet again at swimming competitions. Part Four: Eternal Blue of Departure And so... we're gathered here to plan Rin's surprise farewell party. Let's start. The other day, we surprised him with a pool covered in cherry blossoms. We'd like to gift him with an even bigger surprise. But Haruka and Makoto... Your introduction is too long. So let's talk about ideas for the surprise party. I have one! How about we set off fireworks the moment Rin jumps into the pool? That's over our budget. Then how about we do the muscle dance around his bed when he wakes up? What's with the muscle dance? Let's incorporate the pool, if possible. Then let's move Rin to the pool while he's sleeping! And do the muscle dance! We won't dance! Do you have any ideas, Haru? Grilled mackerel... but instead, it's served raw... but instead... it's a carpaccio. It's so boring. I don't get it. That's Haru's surprise. I'm getting hungry, so let's have lunch. I agree. Let's order pizza! That day, a mouse had sneaked inside the experimental object transmitter. It's okay. No matter how much you have changed... I still love you. Thank you, Veronica. But... Still... I can't live with a cat lover like you! David! - No, don't leave me! - Forgive me! Why did David do such a thing... Veronica was sad too... Rin, stop crying. I'm not crying. I'm going to the bathroom. You can continue wailing over the movie. I said I'm not crying. Gou? What? What is she... She should've told me if she was going out today. Gosh, for me to be eating a Lucky Set with Gou is like... a dream come true. Momo? This is... Could it be... a date? Between Gou and Momo? What happened, Sosuke? Sorry, Rin, I'm lost. What? Seriously? What's around you? A sign that reads Southend. You went the other way. Okay, I'll go there so don't move. Got it. Thanks for waiting. Sorry, when I ordered the Super Deluxe Burger it took longer than I expected. What? Ai, you didn't get the Lucky Set? Only the Lucky Set has a toy included with the burger and potato. And I can enjoy that with Gou! I got it, so calm down. Sorry to interrupt, but can we start with the main event? Oh yes, please do. There was something we wanted to ask you. Do you want to exchange the toy in the Lucky Set? No, Momo. Before Rin leaves for Australia we're planning a surprise party. Yeah, but we couldn't think of any good ideas. So we wanted to talk with the two of you to see if you would have any good ideas. I see. That sounds fun. Since we had a farewell party for him at Samezuka but it wasn't a surprise. A surprise reminds me of a stag beetle. Let's give him a big stag beetle. Momo, he won't be able to take a live beetle to Australia. Oh yeah! I have a present for everyone. What is that? It's the beetle feed tree sap. This is for you two. Thank you. Thank you, Momo! For Gou... here is the special big size! It's for you. Thank you. I'm glad I came today. I'm back. Welcome back. Yeah. Did you go somewhere today? Yeah we had an emergency meeting with Nagisa and the rest. An emergency. What meeting? This and that. What's the matter? So... the thing is... are you... hiding something from me? Hiding something? Of course not! You're being so silly. Rin you shouldn't be so nosy. Gou has her own life too. Stop it, Mom. It's nothing special. Really? Really. That's the tree sap for the beetle. Gou is really... with Momo. What's wrong? N-No... Gou... you... M-Momo... Mo-Mo-Momo... Peach takes three years to grow and persimmon takes eight. - Do you know that? - Huh? I do, but what about it? Nothing, I just wanted to ask. What's wrong with Rin? Beats me. I can't... I can't ask her in person. Gou is no longer a child. It's not my place to say who she can go out with. But I still can't believe it. Momo and Gou are really going out? How was the meeting with Nitori? We got a tree sap to use as beetle feed. Why a tree sap? And he kept on talking about Spotlight Loosejaw. If that was me, I'd be happy to get Spotlight Loosejaw. What is that Spotlight something? It's the secret toy in the Lucky Set. Oh, if that's what it is... I think Rin got it the other day. What? Really? Why did Rin have a Lucky Set? The employee recommended it. Was Rin happy? Not really... If he doesn't want it, I'd really want it! Rin's Spotlight Loosejaw! I really want it! That must've been difficult. Maybe we should ask Sosuke too. At this point, I think I just need to ask Momo. Hey, it's Rin! What's the matter? I had something to ask you. I had something to discuss with you too. - Discuss? - Yes. There's something... that I want. Something you want? Could it be... About Gou... You heard from her? Not exactly... but somewhat... Then I'm begging you! I really want it! Want? Is it possible? Not really, but... it's not something I can say okay and just hand over. Then race with me! If I win against you, then please give it to me. Momo... okay, I got it. I've accepted your earnest feelings. I'll accept that challenge. Tomorrow evening, come to Iwatobi SC Returns. Really? Thank you so much! I'll definitely win! Yay! A challenge? Really? Yeah, Momo finally did it. A challenge to get Matsuoka's younger sister. Momo said he wants her if he wins... Then he must be thinking about marriage. He's still in high school. Mikoshiba Momotaro lives for love. What? Mikoshiba! I thought the Spring Break Training from Hell starts tomorrow. I came early since I wanted to see you guys but what's this about Momotaro? I won't allow it. Not ever! Even if you don't allow it, Rin allowed it so it's okay. Winning against Matsuoka isn't enough. You have to win against me too. You say that but you plan to steal it from me, right? Stop being stupid. If Matsuoka agreed, I won't say anything. But you have to win against me too. There's no way that's possible. Why are you being so pessimistic? I'm always on your side. I have your best interest in mind. Think of this as a race against you, me and Matsuoka. Bro... Mikoshiba and Momo teamed up to race against Rin? Take Your Marks. Is it okay that we came to talk with Sosuke without an appointment? It's okay! Sou hasn't moved out of his dorm yet. What're you doing? Rin! We wanted to talk to Sosuke about the training menu. To Sosuke? We just came by since we couldn't catch him by phone. Is Sou here? He said he was going to the hospital. Maybe I can be of help instead. It's an emergency, Rin! Mikoshiba and Momotaro? The brothers are teaming up? Why is this happening? Well, a lot has been happening. You accepted the challenge, right? Yeah. No way! It's reckless to take on this challenge by yourself. That's right. It's not just Momo. Mikoshiba is a university student with special training. But you can't step back from the challenge, Rin! Of... course. This challenge must be done logically and go against each other as pairs. That's right. Ask Haru for help. No. This is my personal problem. I can't drag Haru into this. Personal problem? It's nothing. If I lose this, I can't go to Australia without worries. I wonder if Nagisa and Rei were able to meet Sosuke? I hope they got some good ideas. Nagisa? We have a favour to ask from Haru! Can he help out Rin with his race? Rin's race? He said that if he loses, he can't go to Australia. Anyways, relay this to Haru. - I'm counting on you. - Wait... Nagisa! What's wrong? It seems like Rin wants to race with Haru. And he won't go to Australia if he loses. Is Rin thinking of giving up swimming at a time like this? That can't be! I haven't heard anything about that. But come to think of it... he was saying weird things yesterday. Weird things? He asked if I knew that it takes eight years to grow persimmons. - Eight years... - To grow a persimmon? It takes eight years for the persimmon tree to produce fruit. Which means that it takes time to produce good results, right? Eight years? Come to think of it it's been more than eight years since he began swimming. Could he be worried about that? He thinks he's a failure? How could this be? He's not losing against a persimmon! This is no time for a surprise party, Haru! Haru? This is rare, Haru for you to call me out. What's up? I heard from Nagisa and Rei about the race. What? They told you? It's my personal problem, so I told them not to drag you in. Personal problem? Yeah. So don't worry. Stop joking. - Huh? - How can I not worry? Why are you getting mad? Wait, do you... and Gou... She has nothing to do with this. Stop changing the subject. I'm not changing it. I was able to step towards the future because of you. But now you're going to stop? Why are you thinking of quitting swimming? You're not lower than a persimmon. Wait... You lost me there! Who said I'm quitting? - You're not? - No! But Nagisa said that if you lose against me you're not going to Australia. That's ridiculous! The race is against Momo and Mikoshiba. Momo said that he wants Gou if he wins against me. They're going out? It seems like it. I saw the two of them meeting up together yesterday. - Yesterday? - Yeah. At the hamburger shop that opened last year. That's probably a misunderstanding. What? Discussion about a surprise? And from what I know, what Momo wants is not Gou. It's Spotlight Loosejaw. What is that? And Haru was it okay that you spilt the secret about the surprise? Gou and the rest will get mad. Oh, my god. You're the type that can't lie. And to me, it's a good enough surprise to swim with you one last time. That's good enough? I think so. Let's take on the challenge and swim tomorrow. Okay, let's start. Two-against-two freestyle relay. Are you ready? Yes. I look forward to the race. This happened by chance, but it's a good opportunity. Let's have fun. I'll win against Rin and get that thing! Haru. Nanase. I'm happy that I can swim with you again. But I won't hold back. Me neither. I won't hold back. That's positive thinking. Take your marks. Ready. My brother got even better since he went to Tokyo. Though he's speeding through the short distance it's not even comparable to when he was in high school. But Haru isn't losing either. He just turned! Haruka turned too. They're both amazing but Mikoshiba's fine techniques are shining. I won't lose, Rin. I'll let you go first. Careful not to get bitten from behind. Momotaro! Rin! Matsuoka has strong legs as always but Momotaro is swimming well too. He must want that toy very badly. Rin looks like he's having a lot of fun too. He really loves to swim, huh? Go Momotaro! 20m left. Yes! Rin, you're so fast. Momo, you've gotten better. What...? I wasn't expecting this. What a surprise! Were you surprised? It's to return the surprise for the cherry blossom pool. The Samezuka members helped out too. Really? I didn't hear about it. Sorry. You can't keep secrets, so we kept it from you. Sorry, Momo. What a great surprise! I see an otter too! And a capybara! It's a surprise for Momotaro. It's become a surprise in return for a surprise. The balloons are Nagisa's idea. Do you like it? We all stayed up last night to make it. You guys... Rin, you can cry. No one will notice if you cry in the pool. Idiots! I won't cry. There's a saying "Because of our tears, we can move forward." Everyone, we have a pool full of balloons. Go in and enjoy it! Yay! Momo. You can have this. Really? Even though I lost? It's a farewell gift. Yahoo! Momo is the most surprised. It's nice to share the surprise. You leave next week, right? Can we see you off? You don't have to come. One has to fly off alone. Rin, you're so cool! It sounds like a poem. Shut up. We won't be able to do this for a while. I had fun this past month being able to spend it with all of you. Thank you. We look forward to seeing you. Okay. Let's continue partying! That's all you're eating? You eat too much. There's a time trial after we enrol in the university. You're so serious, Ikuya. You're too carefree, Hiyori. But it's exciting. There are a lot of competitions this year. The athletes for the world championships next year is becoming clearer. Ikuya is on here too. I'm happy as long as I can swim the way I want. Really? Well, it's really exciting, isn't it? I have to work hard too. Translator: SPECTRA MEDIA
