When Nicki was born, he was perfect. Sometimes, I like to think of him that way... my perfect little boy. I never thought anything would ever change. I never imagined anything could ever take him away. My son was 16 when he died. Well, as you can see by this high pressure zone we've been tracking here, that we're looking at some very wet weather in the next coming days. We're going to be looking at continuing precipitation into the latter part of the week... Brady! You're going to need this. It's supposed to rain. I just wanted to remind you that we have that dinner tonight. I'm on call. You can't keep doing this. I know. Dale? Yes? Do you think they might like some flowers from the garden? I don't know. Can we just talk about this when I get home? So what you must remember when you're fleshing out a character, he is the sum total of his physical make up and all the influences that his environment exerts upon him. It is impossible to consider character, except in connection to his surroundings. Right? Life is change... you know, the smallest disturbance alters the pattern of the whole... Okay, I think that might be it. Yeah. Okay, hand your papers in on your way out... excuses, please form a line. I'm going to be here for five more minutes. Thank you. Hi. What excuse? I work in TV, the hours are insane, and I really... I can't afford to lose my job. So, why did you take this course? I guess I thought it would be easy. That's not the sort of answer the instructor likes to hear. I know. I'm sorry, that was really stupid. Okay, tell me honestly, why you are bothering with this course? I'm taking this course to get my degree so the men that I work with won't just look at me as some dumb blonde who's perfect for the weather. Glad to hear it. What's your name? Sherri. Okay, Sherri from the weather, because you've been so honest, I'll give you until Monday. Really? Yeah, no more excuses. Okay, I promise. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, what's up, man? Get in the game. No, thanks. I'm not interested. Jordie man, I don't want to see you coming back here. All right, next time, it's not gonna be this easy time, all right? I'm not coming back. Good. That's what I want to hear. Let's go, let's get in the game. Let's play. Come on. Hey! Fuck you! That's enough! Fucking kill you! Who are you always calling a freak? You fuck! Shh! Get your shit together, man. 'Cause I'm not going to be around to babysit you much longer, all right? Get your fucking hands off me. With the accumulation of up to about 20 millimeters of rain coming in by Sunday evening. Not all that unusual for this time of year. "Not all that unusual for this time of year..." looking at highs of 14, looking down to about 6 degrees this evening. Dave, back to you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi. Is this Dennis? No, he's not home right now. Do you know when I can reach him? I'm sorry I have to go now. Wait... Oh no, no, no, no, no... Victoria, August 5th, 1959 was... sunny, 24 degrees... Ladner... 1979... November 17... April 4, 1969, 14 degrees, not that unusual for this time of the year. Not that unusual. Yeah, it's got the double walled, stainless steel hood, electronic crossover ignition, firing 57,000 BTUs through six independently controlled stainless steel burners... you've got the rotisserie, side burner... Yeah, it's commercial grade, right. 12,000 BTU input. Really? Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a nice barbecue, Jerry. ...two inches deep. But the black mould, that was the final straw. So we're suing the contractor. Really? Well, you saw the work... Jerry's just up in arms over the whole thing. I hate law suits, I really do. But if you're right, you're right, and you've got to take a stand, otherwise everybody will just walk all over you. I have never seen such utter incompetence, don't you think? Cath? I'm sorry. You saw for yourself, am I right? Of course. Alrighty... not for me, thank you. Are you sure? I don't eat red meat. What? No red meat, Cath? No. Since when? Since I don't eat it. That's absurd. Just give her a steak... I said I don't want any. Why don't you listen? Thanks. Why don't you put some chicken on, dear? It's no trouble... I said I'm fine. No red meat? What kind of diet is that? It's not a diet. 'Cause I'm on the no-carbs one right now myself, but... lots of red meat. And fat! Oh, my god, it is disgusting what I have to eat sometimes... isn't it Jerry? What's that? Oh... yeah, yeah. Sure is. How have you been? All right. I guess they've been feeding you, eh? Listen, Elise and I have been talking... Elise? What does Elise have to do with anything? She cares about you. Oh, okay. Well, she's not my mother, so I don't give a shit, okay? Hey, watch your mouth. All right? What do you think your mother would have to say about the way you're running your life so far? Don't start with my fucking mother. If she were alive today? You'd steal a car, you smash it up all wasted... shining fucking example, Jordie. I'm not going to take any more of your shit. You understand me? What are you going to do, huh? You're gonna knock some sense into me? What did you say to me? You know, Carly's at University now. Yeah, I know. She came to see me before she went to school. Oh, she did? Yeah, she did. Yeah, well, she's at McGill. It's not just school, she's pre-med. It's the best university in the country. Yeah, I know where she is. Thank you. How was everything? Brady's asleep. Okay. If you just give me a minute, I'll give you a ride home. Okay, okay... easy... here. Dale? Dale? Tell Nicky... Jesus, Catherine... that I want to take him to the park tomorrow, but I'm just too tired to come see him right now. Will you tell him for me, please? Enough. Just lie down. Coffee? No. So, in your last letter, you mentioned something about a plan. Yeah... I was thinking maybe college or something. Yes, I believe there's a faculty of "maybe college or something" at my Alma Mater. Well, that sounds fascinating. You have one week to find a job, or you're gone. All right? I've decided I'm not supporting you anymore. You've burned your chances. I've got to go. Bye. Bye. He did miss you, you know. We both did. Hmm. It's good to see you again. You've grown up a lot. Don't you have a job or something? It's my day off. I was going to clean the house. You want to help? What do you think? Suit yourself. Your dad likes these windows very clean. Yeah, I can tell. Carly always used to help me. Now I have to do everything alone. Wow. Now that must have been a really nice mother/daughter experience. She's my friend. She's not your daughter, though. Oh, and I'm not your son, by the way. No one said you were. Just clarifying. Dale? Look, I've got a busy morning. I've got to go. You're going to have to take Brady to school. I don't give a shit how you feel, you're taking him to school. Is that right? For Christ's Sake, Catherine, I'm doing everything around here. You have to pull yourself together. We're a family. We were a family. What the hell is that supposed to mean? You're too busy to notice that we're not a whole family anymore. Listen, just make sure he isn't late. Okay? Oh, don't sit on my shirt. I don't have time to iron it. Sorry. What time do you have to be at school? 8:45. Let's go. Open up. It's me. Maybe you should call your landlord. The front door is broken. Okay. I got your mail, some books, too. Thank you. You got your pills? Yes. I don't see them anywhere. Where are your pills? Dennis, where are your pills? I put them in the bathroom now. Okay. Okay. So we're good... on that. You want to go out for a walk? No. What's this? Walter, you can't read that. Who's this from? Who's Sylvie? Give me my mail! No hitting. No hitting. Is she your girlfriend? No! Sylvie... Walter! Come on. Take it easy. I'm just interested in your letter, okay? I'm interested in Sylvie. Okay, she just got out of jail, and she wants to see you. She was in jail? Yes. What did she do? Something illegal. Nothing bad. Why don't you go out and meet her? I think this could be really good for you. You'll feel better if you go out. Come on, why don't we start today? We'll start today. Walter! No grabbing! Walter! No, no, no! Trail... 1946... it was minus 10 degrees, July 8, 1999 very, very hot... 32 degrees... I'm sorry, Dennis. All right? You all right, Dennis? Shouldn't have done that, Walt. I won't do it again, I promise. Shouldn't have done that, Walt. No... look, what did I just say? I promise I won't do that again. I'll let you go out on your own when you're ready, okay? Okay? Okay. I'm going to go, okay? I'll call you later, all right? Okay. It was two years ago, and maybe starting these sessions now is a waste of time. Why do you think you're here? Just to clear my conscience, be able to let go. I want you to describe it to me. Describe the accident. Just pretend that it's like a short story, okay, as if you're describing someone else... "there was a man." There was a man. His name was... No, no. Don't name him... he's just a man. The man was driving. The man was pretty drunk. The man had his brother in the car. And why had he been drinking? I don't know. Why had this man been drinking? I mean, there must have been some reason. Was it a party, was it a special occasion? The man was drinking to forget. He was usually drunk after work. He would go to this bar by the college, where the other faculty went. He was a teacher. He felt like a failure... and why was he driving with his brother? Was his brother at the bar with him? No. His brother was at group... he was partly autistic, and he would go to this therapy group that was near the college every Friday. Normally, he would take the bus, but there was this transit strike, so he was expecting a ride. But the man had forgotten, and... when he realized how late he was, he rushed like hell. And he felt... terrible for leaving his brother. He had been standing in this small space between the inside doors and the outside doors, walking in circles for an hour... and the security guy was trying to push him out into the street when I got there, and Dennis, he was screaming like a lunatic. And... I was drunk and was trying to get him in the car. And I drove too fast... I... Are you all right? A newspaper article, I... I found it and I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't. What newspaper article is that? The one about the accident. There was a picture of the boy... he was wearing his... uniform. Basketball uniform. Some kind of all-star. What was his name? Nick. Reiker. Yeah, well... I suppose I should have asked. Look, I don't think that I can continue with these sessions. Mom? I don't want you in here, I don't want anyone in here. I wanted to ask if I could go over to Allen's. No. Why not? Are his parents going to be there? I don't know... I don't want you going there if his parents aren't there. Well, I don't know when they're getting back. So... can I go? Goddammit, Brady. Why don't you listen to me? So you've been at the youth detention center... for the past little while it looks like. What'd you do, you rob somebody? No. I don't see how this has anything to do with the job. Okay, you don't want to talk about it, you don't want the job. That's fine, but if you think there's a lineup of guys like me, willing to hire guys like you, you'd better get going. You wouldn't want to miss out. I stole a car. You stole a vehicle? Yeah. And you think you can handle this here? Yeah. Okay, 'cause I tell you, kid, it's no joke. Once 5:00 comes, it hits fast and furious. This place turns into a zoo. All right. You got a vehicle? Yeah, yeah... I can get here. Did you steal your vehicle? No. Humour's important. It's good to have a good time. What are you doing? My mother's crab dip. It's too runny. Your blue shirt's on the bed. We have to be there in 45 minutes, so... I haven't even done my nails. Look, I thought we talked about this. Look, I'm not in the mood. I mean, all that talk about space, color and texture, it drives me up the fucking wall. I really, I can't take it, okay? Does this taste okay to you? For Christ's sake, Abby, I'm trying to tell you something. Could you put down the fucking crab dip and look at me, just look at me? I can't believe we only sold three paintings tonight. I just don't get people. To get them to commit to a piece of art... No. Know what I mean? I see your point... What point? Whatever you were saying. You weren't listening to me. What the hell are you doing? Give that back. I was watching that. Now I'm missing it. Missing what? Since when do you watch the weather? Since when do you watch the weather? Look, I'm not in the mood, okay? You're never in the mood. I've got a lot of papers I need to grade for tomorrow. I've gotta work. Sure, Walt. You should be writing, not grading papers. Why don't you write anymore? I teach. That doesn't mean you can't write. I mean, when we first met, you wrote. You were much more into writing than teaching. Well, now I'm more into teaching. People change. What about that new book? Junk. It's not junk. I dumped it. Why? It was the start of something. It was shit. What would you know anyway? Well, I used to be a student of yours. You used to have a certain confidence in my judgement. At least you pretended to anyway. Look, Abby, the book was shit, okay? I don't understand how you can teach and not write. Look, my teaching salary comes in pretty handy when your little fucking gallery sells two lousy paintings in a month. We don't have the money for both of us to be living this little bohemian fantasy. So fuck off with your trip about my writing, and stay out of my business, okay? Sure. Well as you can see by the rain coming down, it is going to be a very wet one. I know when I was walking to work this morning, I just got drenched. I was soaked to the bone. My clothes were just clinging to my body... What the fuck's wrong with you? Sorry. Jordie? Oh, My God, hey. Hey. When did you get back? Last night. Yeah, cool, I heard you were getting back soon. It's so good to see you. Yeah, you too. So, what did you do to pass the time? I just read. Mostly. Oh, what did you read? You know, all sorts of stuff. Nothing you'd be interested in. Well, it was really nice to see you. Yeah. Bye. You look nice by the way. Yeah? I've done something different with my hair. Yeah, I noticed. Yeah, you like it? It's good. So, there's a party this weekend. Really. You should come. Yeah, I'll think about it. I saw Nick's mom at the store. She seemed to know when you were coming back... Oh, yeah? Have you talked to her yet? No. No, I haven't. Well, you should. Why is that? I don't know. You should just talk to her. I'm probably the last person that she wants to talk to, okay. You should come to the party. See ya. What is this? Where are you going? Look, shouldn't we at least talk about this, Abby? We've talked enough. No, I can't stay here. I'll be at my sister's. Hello? Hi. I'm trying to get ahold of Dennis Braugher. Do you have a number or do you know where he might be? No. Who is this? This is Sylvie Farber. Are you still there? It's Dennis. I've been trying to get ahold of you. Do you want to get together? Um, I don't know. I don't know... Sylvie. I'm very sorry, I can't go out. Oh, Dennis no, no, no, no, no. Cache Creek, 1982, June 13, 1976... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hello? She called. Who called? Sylvie. What did she say? Nothing. What do you want to do? I don't know, Walt. I was hoping that you could tell me what to do. Why don't you phone her back and ask her to meet you? Mm. I don't know, Walt. Jesus Christ, Dennis, do whatever you want. I'm going to bed. Hello? Dennis, I'm sorry, okay? Look, don't call her back. It's too late. Sleep on it and we'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? Good night. Good night, Walt. Sorry. I didn't know you were home. Yeah, well, I am. I'm sorry for... I shouldn't just walk in like... I just came to see if you had any dirty clothes lying around. No. No, I don't. I thought I'd do your laundry for you. I already did it, okay. Are you all right? Would you just stop trying to be my fucking mother, please? Oh, here. Thank you. Here, let me take some of these. I got that. You got it? You like that, Professor? Oh, God. Oh, My God. You want to smoke a joint? A joint? Yeah. Pot. Yeah, I know what a joint is. Sure. Are you crazy, lady? I'm playing linebacker. I get to tackle all the time. Coach says I'm really good at it... you should be playing basketball. I'm no good at basketball. That's not true. You just have never put your mind to it. My father played basketball his whole life. Nicky was an all-star three years in a row. Would you stop it, Catherine? Where are you going, Brady? Brady? Don't you knock? What did you want? Do you mind letting me get dressed? Elise? Shit. Jesus. Fuck. Elise? Elise? Hey, you okay? Yeah, hi, baby. Fine. Well, if you're fine, what are you doing in bed? It's almost dinnertime. I wasn't feeling very good, so I decided to take a nap. I guess I must have overslept. Yeah? You feel all right now? Yeah, I was having the weirdest dream. Yeah? Yeah, it was about you... Yeah? What were you dreaming about? I was dreaming about you... when was the last time you dreamt about me? Carl, just not so rough. Come on, since when don't you like it rough, baby? Lying in our bed here, dreaming about me? It's... Jordie will be expecting dinner soon. The kid can make his own fucking dinner. Remember this? You remember this? Yeah... did you miss me? Yeah. Did you miss me? Yeah. Glad you miss me. Open up. I brought you some clothes. Here. How you doing? Okay. Hello. What the hell are you doing, Dennis? What the hell are you doing? Calm down, Dennis. She is... she can't come in! Just a second... Walt, no, no, no, no. 2001... Comox... that's it. Just meet her. She's really nice, she's really nice, you've seen her before. You've seen her before. Okay? February 9... you've seen her before. She can't come in, Walt. I have to pee. Walt, what the hell is going on? Can you wait in the car? Yeah, okay. Okay, thanks. Is she gone? Yes, she's gone. Come here. Come here. Look, I brought you those for your date with Sylvie. I thought you might like to get a little dressed up. Okay? Thanks. You are going to get ready? What time do you meet her? 10:00. Okay, quarter after 9:00. Let's get moving. You didn't like them, did you? Not really. This is my best outfit. That's okay. You're not going to shower, are you? No. That's all right. I brought this. Girls like guys who smell good. Is that why Abby married you? I don't think so. Do you love Abby? Of course I do. Do you love your girlfriend from the Weather Channel? She's not my girlfriend, she's my friend. In fact, she's a student of mine. She has the nicest mouth. When she tells the weather, she... licks her lips... have you noticed that? I can't say that I have. Don't do that on your date. Change the subject. Let's, let's try to get you outside, okay? Okay. Okay. Let's get you out on your date. Come on, you can do it. Take it slow. Come on... come on, you can do it. I can't do it, Walt. I can't go outside. I can't leave. Sorry. Walt? Jesus Christ, what took you so long? What's the matter with you... just leaving me sitting here... I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have brought you... he hasn't stepped foot outside of that apartment in two years. We were in a bad car accident. He was hurt pretty bad. So what, that's why he's all... no, I mean, he was never really all there, but he was making progress. Thanks to me, he kind of went backwards. So why did you bring me into all of this? I wanted him to meet you. I mean, he's interested in a girl, so I thought it wouldn't hurt for him to meet a stranger, he... he recognizes you from TV. I thought he'd get a kick out of it. You know, it's getting kind of late. Can you just take me home? We haven't really gone anywhere. Yeah, I know. Maybe another night. Aren't you supposed to be at football practice now? Didn't feel like going. How come? I just didn't, all right. What's with the big inquiry? Brady, you've got to bend your knees and get right under the ball. You've got to bend your knees, Brady, and get under the ball. Like you'd know anything about it... Aw, shit. Damn it. Brady, run in the kitchen and get me that first aid kit. Brady, move! Come on! No shoes in the house. Dad cut his finger. Where did you get that ball? Where did you get that ball? Goddammit, Brady. How many times have I told you to leave your brother's things where I put them. He's dead, all right? He doesn't need his stupid ball, or his room or anything. Why did you do it? Do what? Steal that car. I guess to prove I could. Was it your idea? Yeah. Yeah, it was my idea. Stealing the car, driving the car, wrecking the car, fucking up my life. It's all my idea, Elise. I'm sorry. It was stupid to bring it up. Your father blames himself, you know? It's what's made him so unbearable. He's becoming a tired old man. He barely seems to notice me anymore. Do you know how lonely I've been? Thank god, you're here, Jordie. I can't tell you how glad I am that you're here. Sherri! Here, for you. Where are you going? I have to get to the studio. Oh. Can I call you? You know, Walt, maybe we should just take a little break. Break? From what? I have to go, I'm late. Sherri, what are we taking a break from? Exactly? $28.50. Yeah, thanks. Welcome to the Pizza Zone. Wow, look at you. You got a job. Yeah. You sure look cute in that uniform, Jordie. Can I get you something? What's your favourite? I don't eat here. Oh, okay. Well, I'll just get a drink then. And here you go. Water. So, you never showed up at the party. No. No, I didn't. I was looking for you. Yeah? Yeah. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to get out a little bit. At present, I'm just hanging out with Pizza Zone employees only, so... what time do you get off? A couple of hours. Do you want to do something? Jordie, I see a lineup forming and it's not even rush-hour. Let's go. Right now, please. Right, Tim. So... I'll call you later. Yeah, sure. Okay. See ya. Bye. What are you doing up? I was getting a drink. Listen, Brady, about this afternoon... don't bother. I'm sorry, Brady. So you want to come in? I don't know. It's kind of late. Do you think it's okay with your parents? My dad's not home. Besides, it's not like I have to ask for permission. You know... I liked being Nicky's girlfriend... but I don't really miss him all that much. God. Is that terrible? I don't know. I never really knew him all that well. You know, it was more of a status thing, I guess. It's like... sometimes, he was this All-Star, and then he'd act like this tough street kid... and I never really knew which one he was, did you? He definitely wasn't from the ghetto. Well, I know that, but... but you were never any different. You were always the same. I was whoever he wanted me to be. Well, I always thought you were very sweet. I missed you, Jordie. Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you come in. Jordie, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? I'm Melissa. How do you know Jordie? We went to High School together. Oh. I don't remember him talking about you. That was weird. You should go. Why? Please. Want something to drink? Yes, please. Water. Lemonade! I'll see who it is. No, no, no. Who is that? I'm not here. Walt, don't! No, no, no, no, no. Just calm down, Dennis. I'll see who it is. I'm not here. Sylvie? Dennis? No, I'm Walt, Dennis' brother. Dennis is right here. Dennis? I'm not here. I mean it, Walt. Dennis... I said, no one comes in. Dennis, get out from under the blanket. No-no-no-no-no, don't make me mad. Dennis, Dennis. Get out from under the blanket. It's Sylvie. Dennis, is that you? You know what, I'm going to wait outside the door, and we can talk through the door if you like. Okay? Just wait here. All right, talk to her like you're on the phone. Pretend like you're talking to me. Through the door. Just like you're on the phone. On the phone? On the phone. Okay. Hello. Hello. How are you? Hello, Sylvie. How are you? Okay. Hello, Sylvie. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Good. So... I don't really like having people in my house. Walt probably should have told you that it might be like this, then you could have just stayed at home and we could have talked on the phone. Yeah, you're right. He should have told me, but... I'm glad I came. You are? Sure. Okay. Good. Okay. Don't go anywhere, okay? Okay. Hang on one second. Whoops. Here. You can have a seat. Have a seat. Are you sitting? Yeah. It's a great chair, thanks. Oh, good. Do you live far from here? Not too far. I took the bus. It's kind of cool that it stops right outside the apartment building. Yeah... I don't take the bus. Do you drive? No. Well, how do you get around? Well, I don't really... get around. Well, you should take the bus sometime. Maybe we could go together. Oh, um... did you maybe want to go somewhere today? Okay. Not today. Some other time, maybe? Yeah! Okay. Right. What? Excuse me. Is Sherri... Walt, what the hell are you doing here? I just wanted to talk to you. Who is this guy? What, are you fucking this guy? You know what, that's none of your fucking business. What the fuck are you doing? Sherri, open up. Come on, Sherri, please open the door. What are you doing here? I thought that we agreed to take a break? You never let me agree to anything. We barely spoke. Does it hurt? Yeah. Come on, Sherri, please open the door! I'm going to get you a cloth, okay? God. Went by your house. But your step-mother didn't seem to know where you were. Elise. Is that what you call her? That's her name. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Is she nice? Sure. Yeah. Is she... anything like your mother? No. No, she's not. Did you see the way she looked at me when she came into your room? Oh, My God... Seriously, it was like I was trying to steal her boyfriend or something. When I get that age, I really hope I'm not like that. Can we stop talking about Elise? Sorry. It's okay. Do you like me, Jordie? Yeah. You know, I hate the weather. Really? Uh-huh. I hate teaching. Really? You know, I always wanted to be on TV, but not just as some bimbo... I wanted to get the news anchor job. I wanted to be taken seriously. I just wanted to get a regular paycheck so I could write my novel. Did you ever write it? Did you? What do you think? I don't know. You don't remember me, do you? What do you mean? I actually interviewed you two years ago on the steps of the courthouse. That was when you got released from those criminal charges for that accident that killed that kid. You know, it was supposed to be my big break. They didn't have anyone else, so they sent me to cover it. I don't remember much from that day. I remember that woman... the kid's mother... how she came after you. She, like, practically chased you back into the car, just demanding to know why you did it. The cops finally restrained her, but you just... you kept your cool the whole time. You know, you never looked her in the eye, you just walked away. I remember thinking how controlled you were. I probably would have flipped out on that woman. She was a total lunatic. It's funny how things work out, isn't it? Yeah. Funny. To think that fate brought us back together two years later. You must have had a really good lawyer. Hey, what are you doing? I've got to go. Jordie, you haven't cleaned the bathrooms yet. Yeah, I know. I haven't had time. Okay, well, you just remember it's your turn to clean the bathrooms. I heard you, I said I didn't have time. So, what do you want me to do? Okay, now it seems like we have a little conflict. If you want me to clean the bathrooms, fine, I'll clean the... Whoa, steady mister. Do you remember when I asked you if you thought you could handle it? You want the bathrooms cleaned, I'll clean the bathrooms. The fast food industry is no joke. It comes fast and furious at Pizza Zone. You have duties, you have responsibilities... now, if you can't handle it, maybe I need to find someone who can. You know what, Tim? You can take your job and you can stick it up your fucking fat ass. Who the fuck do you think you are anyway? I'm your manager, that's who I am. Now you get in there and clean up those bathrooms, and I'll forget this ever happened. Oh, you're the manager, you're really lighting the fucking world on fire, aren't you, Tim? Huh? Getting paid a dollar over minimum wage. Managing some fucking shitty pizza restaurant. You're doing awesome. By the way, you're not my manager anymore. I quit. Go fuck yourself. Fucking dickhead. Pompous fuck. You cannot keep that shirt! That's okay. You're certainly in a good mood. Yeah. Are you going to leave your little friend sitting outside? No. Jordie... Jordie, Jordie, can you just please... can you just wait for a second? Where are you going? Out. We need to talk. Can we talk about it later, Elise? Jordie. Bye, Elise. hello? Hi. This is Jordie... I'm a friend of Nicky's. I'm glad you called... I thought you were going to hate me. It's not true. I was going to call you, but I didn't know what you were going to say. I didn't think you'd want to see me. It seems like so long ago, you know. A different life. I want you to know it was all my idea... the whole thing, the car and everything. I'm sure you've heard about it all. I didn't see the guy. He swerved right into us, just happened so fast. I was driving, Nicky didn't want to. He was good. He was really good. I was bad... and I've had... a long time to think about... That's not true. I don't think I knew Nicky the way that I thought I did. If anyone is to blame, it's probably me. I never... I never put the time in with him... and then he was a teenager, getting into trouble... and, oh... I can see all the mistakes so clearly now. It is such a relief to talk about it. Nobody wants me to remember. They think it'll just make it worse. But people don't realize you can't go back... you just can't, and even if you could, you wouldn't know how. I wish it was me. No... No, I do... No, don't say that. The whole time I was in there... that's all I could think about. I wish it was me. It should have been me. Hello? Walt. You're home. Yeah. I'm home. Well... it's Thursday. Yeah, Dennis, I know. It's Thursday. Thursday you come over here and you bring me my mail. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I've got to go. I'm gonna go out with Sylvie tonight. I know, okay? I'll call you later, Dennis. Goodbye. Catherine, what the hell are you doing? What are you doing? Stop it! No! No! Stop it! Please, please. Stop! I know you think I'm crazy. I'm not. I just couldn't stand it. Your brother's things. This house. I thought you liked Nicky's things the way they were? I don't know, Brady. You're all I've got now. And I hope that... you will give me a chance to make things better. I'm so sorry. I love you. I need to get away for a little while... and I'm going to bring you with me. Where are we going? To your Aunt's house. Just for a little while. We'll just... we'll spend time together and... just be together. All right. You'd better get out there and help your dad, before the neighbors call the fire department. Sure. Brady? Thank you. Walt? 19... 2001. Dennis... Um, partly cloudy, periods of rain... Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Prince Rupert... November 10, 1954. July 22, 1982... when it was 23 degrees. 23 degrees... Okay. Okay, here we go, Dennis. Okay, buddy. Ready. Come on Catherine, please. What are you doing? You never cried. I will never forgive you for that. Our son died and you went on living your life like nothing happened. Because that's what people do... Catherine, they keep moving forward. Please. Don't touch me, Dale. You have no idea what I go through every night... what it's like to be a mother. And to know exactly what you're on this earth for. And to have it taken away from you. And then to live like nothing happened. That's the worst part, Dale. I can't do it anymore. Dennis, sorry I'm so late. Dennis? Dennis. There wasn't a cloud in sight. The flowers are starting to bloom, people are finally outside, so I would take advantage of it if you can this weekend, and get outside and enjoy it, because next week, it looks like we're going to be getting some rain fronts coming in probably by Wednesday. Abby, I just want to talk. Can you call me? I need to speak to your wife. Get off my property. It was me. I know who you are. Hurry up, Brady! Hey, Elise. Elise? Elise, what's going on? What makes you think I have the slightest interest in what you have to say? I need you to hear me. Please don't tell me you're sorry. I am. But I am! She told me what you did to her... what the fuck were you thinking, you little delinquent piece of shit? Look, hold on a second! Don't touch me! What do you want from me? You want me to forgive you? To stand here and tell you everything is okay? Is that what you want? Is that what you want? This is what he does to people, Elise... he uses them, he manipulates them... You broke your mother's heart... Fuck you! Huh? What did you say? Fuck you. I hate you! You use my wife? Use her like one of your little whores? You just kept pushing her! I hate you! Go away from me! Get the fuck off him... get the fuck away! Let's just go, come on. It's okay. Are you all right? I'm good. # if this it... # # asleep at the wheel # # I'll sober up # # if we get out # # if this is on... # # I had to offer # # forgive me, my love # # it's not your fault # # in defense # # I did what I had to # # I know that it hurts # # you know you were wrong # # and if I screwed this up # # forgive me all in time # # 'cause it will work itself out # # and if I screwed you up # # the crash was so unkind # # I left you there to die # # I could have pulled you out # # you could have told me to stop # # and stood up for yourself # # what we had was ours # # I could look at you for hours # # and we could never take that away # # in time these burns will heal # # then I'll begin to feel... # Subtitles by LeapinLar
