-Alright. Been working on a new take. -Alright, let's hear it. -I'm still formulating it. -Then why did you bring it up? -Okay, fine. So let's say two dudes made the game. -Okay. -And whether they are actual brothers or more like, you know, brothers from another mother, soulmate-type dudes... -Like us. -Yeah, like team, you know? -Yep. -Every team needs a mascot, and some would argue that Mario is the maybe more attractive one. -No, they have the same face. -No, they didn't. -Yeah, they did. Luigi was literally the same guy. Just a different color. -No, no, in the first one, he was, but they eventually became their own people. -Yeah. By became their own people, you mean they stretched out Mario to make Luigi? Sure. -Dude, whatever. It doesn't matter. It's not the point. -Okay, then, Billy. What is your point? -I'm sorry. You got somewhere you need to be right now? -No, man. -You busy? -I'm just on pins and needles, honestly. -The point, my friend Ray, is that someone is still the face of the operation. -Okay, but why? -Because somebody's got to be the leader. -Or appear to be the leader. -That's fine. Someone has to look like they are in charge. So one brother steps into that role and the other one kind of becomes like -- -What, the sidekick? -No, man, I was gonna say, like the secret sauce. -You mean like the man behind the curtain? -Whatever, man. Same thing. So, look, anyhow, this got me thinking about dude relationships and maybe how these guys had, like, a similar dynamic in real life, right? You know, like, one of them speaks for both of them, but in reality, behind the scenes, the other one... -The secret sauce. -That's right. -Gotcha. -And you know how like when people are making something, like, they don't realize it, they kind of put themselves, like, in the thing? -I do. Yeah. We reflect ourselves in the things that we do. -Exactly. So these dudes, they don't realize it, right? But they put their relationship in the game. And now here we are wondering like, "Oh, why is Mario in charge?" Alright, go ahead. -What? -I know you think it's stupid. -I didn't say that. -Well, you don't have to. -I actually didn't say anything. -I hate it when you do that. -Do what? Okay, look, man. That's your whole theory? It took you two weeks to come up with that? -I didn't say it was the whole -- It's half-baked, man. You made me tell it to you too soon. That's why it sounds dumb. -Because there's so much more to expound upon, right? It's just plenteous with depths to mine? I'm being facetious. That means I'm kidding. -Don't -- don't -- don't do -- don't do that. I know. -Don't do what? -I know what that means. -Unnnnh. Do you? -You know what? You mispronounce the word capricious one -- one time. One fucking time, you know. -Yeah, well, you showed them, didn't you? -That's not funny. -It's a little funny. -It's not that funny. It hurts my feelings. -Oh, you gonna try to take me out, too? Oh, you'll never survive without me. -Oh, shit. -You want some of this? Whoo! Here we go. -Oh! -Truce! Jinx! -Truce! Jinx! -Okay. Alright. We're even now. Even now? -Oh. You know what? Just admit it. You love my theories. You love hearing them. -Don't even flatter yourself. You want a theory? How about this? What if Mario goes by their surname? Like Luigi's full name is Luigi Mario. -Wait, then what's Mario's first name? -It's "Mare-io" Mario to differentiate. -That's so dumb. -I'm gonna go jump in the shower. -I got first shower. Unh-unh. -Alright. You can go first. -Wait, wait. Where are you going? -I'm gonna keep running. -No, you're not. You ain't going anywhere without me. No. I don't want you to run without me. -Let me go, dude. I'm going to take a goddamn shower. -I'm gonna lock this shit up. No! -You are a giant man baby! -Fuck! -Oh, my God. Jesus. -Need some help? -What? -Stream of conscious format leaves a lot of the heavy lifting to the reader. It's admittedly not the easiest. -No, I'm just trying to follow along with all these freaking footnotes. Couldn't you have stocked this place with some more laid-back reads? -I built it, I fill it. -You -- Well, you didn't literally build this place, right? -Yeah, but I did literally save your ass, Billy, so... -I'm just saying, throw in a couple of beach reads, man, and not books you would read on the beach like Hamilton or... -Frederick Douglass has got a nice one. -Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Normal-people beach reads. -Aren't beach reads whatever you enjoy, man? -No, they're not. They're easy entertainment. That's why they call them Beach reads. Okay? You're on vacation. You don't have to work that hard. -Would you call this a vacation, Billy? -Easy entertainment. -Yeah. -No tiny little footnotes all over the place. And who doesn't use quotes when someone's talking? I mean, I can never tell who's speaking. Is it him or is it her? -There is no her. -What are you talking about? -It takes place inside of a men's prison. -Wait, wait. Hold on. So it's two... -Did you -- did you read the words? -So when they're... -Like, um... -Well, I may have jacked off to some stuff I didn't totally understand. -Yeah. -Speaking of which, you and I need to do a little regroup on the rules, my friend. -What's that? -Look, I get it. Sometimes you're in bed. You just got to take care of something real quick. But it's hard to pretend that you don't know what's happening when, you know, you hear the little squeaking, squeaking coming from the bed next door. And I'm not trying to be critical. I'll admit I've done it. Not in the bathroom a couple of times myself over the years. Yeah, more than a couple times. But how does a brilliant person such as yourself design this place... -Oh, shit. -...and not come up with a better system? I mean, it's not like we can put a sock on the door in here, you know? God. I miss college. Fuck. I miss...sex. Don't you? Dude, are you even listening to me? Are you -- What are you -- Ray -- -Yeah. -Oh, shit. Another one? -Yeah. -What is that? Two left now? Should we be worried? -Uh...It'll be okay. -Okay, good. 'Cause on the bright side, I'm really hoping this means we can have fish tonight. Yes, we could. -Yes. Yes. Which one is it, by the way? -It's, um, Sam. -Oh, that's kind of sad. -Yeah. Let me get dinner ready. -Yeah. Diane, what are you gonna do without your Sam? Guess they weren't meant to be after all, huh? -Guess not. -Now you're stuck with Woody. Here. You want some of this? -That is all yours, my friend. -I feel bad eating Sam, but I needed this. I really needed this. -You shouldn't feel bad. -But it's Sam. -I know. -We've known him his whole little fishy life. -I know, but it's part of the design, right? -Yeah. Speaking of, how is the cycling gonna keep cycling if we lose one more? You know, are we gonna be all right? -Yeah, it'll be okay. -I can't wait for the day when you don't say "We'll be okay." Actually, I can wait. But you know who can't? -We doing it? -We're doing it. -We're doing it. -Oh, you know we're gonna do it. It's tradition. Alright. We are gathered here today to commemorate Sam -- Come on, man. Get it up. Reverence. -Got it. -Thank you very much. Sammy, we thank you for giving your life for your country. As President, I hereby confer upon you the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I'm sorry I don't have any physical medals. Those were all destroyed. But the honor doesn't mean any less than the actual medals I would have given to actual people if they were still here. Should I have given out more medals when I had the chance, by the way? -Well, you were only president for 14 months. -Well, if you count the time we've been in here... -But I don't, so... -Well, poo on you, then. You tasted fucking delicious, my friend. Your Diane will miss you. But sometimes we need to go to the place where everybody knows your name. -And they are always glad you came. -For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. Amen. Now give your son a goodbye kiss before I eat his face off. Give it. Do it. -Oh! -No. No. Kiss. Kiss. -I cannot believe I just did that. -Yeah. Get in -- Ray. -Hmm? -Who am I kissing? You said this was Sam, but Sam didn't have that little -- the little Goldie Hawn mole right above his -- above his mouth there. Did he? -No. -No, he didn't. So... -Diane did. -We ate Diane? But, um... Sh... -She was our last female. -Oh, shit. -Hey... -It's gonna be okay. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ray? -Yeah. -I think we need to talk. -I know. -I mean -- -I know, Billy. We will figure something out. -How come you never taught me how to warp? -Huh? -You taught me all the moves in "Super Mario Brothers." Every one. You never taught me how to warp. -To warp. -Yeah. To jump forward to different worlds so you can finish the game. -I know what warping is. -Then why are you saying "to warp" like I'm speaking pig Latin or something? -I don't know, I guess I just don't understand why we're talking about warping right now. -Do you have any idea how embarrassing it was for me to show up at Yale? I'm the only one who doesn't know how to warp? -People were playing Nintendo at Yale? -The cool ones were. -Billy, why are we talking about "Super Mario Brothers" right now? -Because I don't like it when you handle me or -- or -- or manage me. And don't give me that face. I know you know what I'm talking about. Okay? You withhold info from me like warping and -- and Diane. -It's called protecting. -I'm a grown man, okay? I can handle the truth. -I don't think you can. -Dude, I ran the fucking country. - That's debatable. -Why do you keep things from me? -Because you are super touchy, Billy, and you freak out. -I do not freak out! -As your friend, I try to guide the situation at the right time into your purview so that it is more palatable. -No more big words! No "purview," no fucking "palatable." I want the truth. -Okay. -Look at me. Give me the truth. -You want me to be honest with you? -Yes. Yes. Please. -I will be honest with you. Okay? The facts of the situation are with no more female fish in the pond, they have no ability to procreate. Once the fish die off, the pond will cease to be self-sustaining. We will officially run out of food not long after that. -Okay. That wasn't so hard. -What is it? -Why are we running? -We run every day. -Yeah, but why? What's the point? -Fuss budget! -What -- What? What did you just say? -Called you a fussbudget. -I don't know what that means. -It means you're being fussy and you're taking up emotional space with all your pouting. -Well, I'm sorry. I just don't understand the point of continuing to run anymore. And also, I think I have kind of a stomachache. -I know you don't have a stomachache. You never have stomachaches. And the reason why I'm running is because that's what we do every morning. -Respectfully, Ray, you have no idea how I'm feeling, so fucketh off. -You know what? If it wasn't politically incorrect, I'd call you a fucking pussy. -Look around, dude. There's nobody here to correct you, so go ahead and say what you want. I have a fucking stomachache! -Hey, Billy. You're a big, fat fucking pussy, bro. -What is it that I am? -You're a big, fat fucking pussy. -Oh, okay. Okay. -You heard me. Goddamn it. I just patched that. -Well, maybe you should have built a better dome. -Maybe if you had done your job, we wouldn't need to live in a dome. You ever thought about -- -Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Did it do anything? -No! It didn't do anything. It's built to survive far more than your tantrums, man. -Oh, fuck. What does it matter? We're just gonna die anyway. Goddammit. -Okay, William, I could try to explain to you the real reason that I keep running, but I don't think you want to hear it. -Hear what? -You know. -No. -Yes. -No! Don't you fucking dare. -Bowling ball. -No, dude, that is bullshit, and you know it. Okay? This is the end. This is real this time. -Calm the fuck down, dude. I'm gonna find a way to keep us alive. I just need you to believe. -Well, I don't believe, that's it. And don't fucking say that again. -Bowling ball. -Aah! -Fine, Billy. Alright? I'll be the only one over here just trying to keep a modicum of hope alive. Alright? -Are you serious? -What? -What the fuck? -What the fuck is what? -What? His colors are all weird. Look! Ah, fuck it, man. We're dead anyway. That's it. It's probably the same thing that happened to Diane, you know? -There you go. Look how sick he is. -I don't know. He seems different. Diane didn't have these weird growths or change in pigment. I don't know. -You don't know? -Yeah. Huh. Check this out. It just shed right off. -Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Oh, God. It's real. We're gonna die. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was being a dick. We're gonna die this time. We're gonna die in here. Oh, shit. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Oh. - Dude. Come on. Calm down. It's gonna be okay. Alright? -I got to spin it out. -Do your breathing exercises. Alright? We don't -- We don't know that he's dying or that it's the same thing that happened to Diane. Diane was old. -Yeah, but he looks... He looks so sick. -I know. It just doesn't make any sense, man. Something would have to be introduced into its habitat, right? The pond seal is solid, and we're sealed in here. Unless... -What? What, you think I did something? -I didn't... -That's the look you give me when you think I did something. -It was your job to check the ammonia levels last. -I did. Don't you think I've been in here long enough to know how important this damn pond is? I'm not a total fucking idiot. And by the way, I'm not the genius that only put one pond and a couple of plants in here for the whole fucking dome. -Oh, bro, you're lucky we even have one pond. Because if I'd followed your shitty crayon drawings, all we'd have is some video games and a toilet. I'm just saying, if we're talking about track records... -Yeah, because your opinion of me hasn't changed since we were, like, 6 years old. A person can change. They can -- -Are you okay? -Oh, shit. Don't tell me I don't have a fever. I know I have a fever. -Alright. -Don't -- -You know what? -Yeah. -You have a fever. -Are you serious? -You really do. -Shit. I knew it. I bet it was Diane. Why did I eat the head? That was so stupid. -I don't think eating her head made you sick. -Well, you didn't eat her head, and you're not sick. -I think you just need to rest. It's probably stress. Why don't you take a nap? -I'm not taking a nap. I don't want to go to sleep. -Oh, my God. -I might not wake up. -You're gonna be just fine. -You don't know that. -I'll check in on you. You call me if you need me. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. -What? -I don't know. Thanks. -You're welcome. Shit. What the...? -Ray. Get out here, please. What? -What? -What the fuck is that? -Oh, I know. I mean, I don't know. But, yeah. -You know? It looks like the whole world is ending again. -No, we don't know anything. Might not be a bad thing. -You think this could be good? -Dude, it could be a lot of things, right? We got time to figure that shit out. -What's going on with you? -There's something else. -Something else? - It's remarkable. It is remarkable, though not unprecedented. Right? Nature is full of historical contingencies. Nature. -Alright. You're giving me, like, crazy college vibes right now. Did you even sleep? -No, don't worry about that. It's good. Where was I? -Uh, contingencies. -Yes, right. Thank you. Historical contingencies have been known to deviate, become less predictable. So I started thinking about less predictable variables, especially environmental factors and those that affect survival. Then -- Hey -- I remembered back in my undergrad, reading about the clownfish being protandrous. Protandrous. Do you know what that means? -Yeah. I -- No. No. -Listen, it's okay. I just need you to understand that there is a precedent here, because I need you to believe me when I tell you that -- -You know what? Just tell me what's wrong with Woody. -I don't think anything is wrong with Woody. I think Woody is adapting. -Okay. Like how? -Well, with fish, the anatomical boundary between male and female is much more fluid than it is on land. Like the clownfish that I mentioned, when they lose their main female, another male changes and takes her place. His sex organs transform into female sex organs. And in Woody's case... -So are you saying... -...I think that Woody is undergoing sequential hermaphroditism, right? Matured as one sex and is now changing into another. -Is this just like a theory of yours, or is this something that actually happens in nature? -I can't find any historical evidence that a fish like Woody has ever changed, but clams, the clownfish, shrimp -- a bunch of others have. -Yeah. Yeah. But why now with Woody? Because that's the... -The threat to survival. I think this is Woody's way of opening the door back up to reproduction, man. -Dude, dude, this is fucking nuts. -Fuck, yeah, it is. It's fucking insane, bro. -But it feels fast. -It does. -Diane just died. It would be like evolution in two days. -I know, I know, but with no more females left, there was a greater need for efficiency. -Are we talking like... Like brand-new, yummy, baby fish? -I'm sure as shit hoping that that's where this leads to. -So maybe we're not gonna die? -Well... -Holy shit! Yeah! -You said it. You said it. You said it. I didn't believe you. You're always saying it. You're always like, "Whoa, you know what? We're gonna find a way." Dude. -What? -Life finds a way. -Oh, shit. You didn't just quote "Jurassic Park," did you? -I think somebody else said it first. -Well, then, son, if that's what it takes for you to get your head up around this thing, yeah, baby. Life just found a motherfucking way. -I mean, Woody's a she. This is crazy. -Well, almost. I mean, anatomically, from exterior observations, he's nearly there, or she's nearly there. And I would only presume that internal ovaries are progressing at a similar rate, given that the testes absorption is nearly complete. -Wait, what? Testes... -Absorption. Woody's... Woody's will soon no longer be. What's going -- Where are you going? This is a... Woody, you just saved our lives. This is... -Oh! -What? -Oh! Aah! -Aah! Holy shit, bro. Where'd your dick go? -It's there! -Where? -It's -- It's hiding. -Is it shrinking? -No, it's not shrinking. -Let me see. -Wait, wait. You don't need those. -Let me see. -Wait. -I have a doctorate. -In biochemistry. -Among other things. -Not the time to brag. -I'm just trying to see what's going on. -Okay, okay, okay. Just don't touch anything. Alright? What's happening? What? You see, that's -- that's -- I'm not -- I'm not a fish turning into a lady fish. -I didn't say you were turning into a lady fish. -Good. Because that would be fucking insane. -I said you appeared to be exhibiting similarly to Woody. -What? So you're saying I'm exhibiting turning into a woman? -Well, I'm saying that I think your biological sex organs may be changing like Woody. -No. What's happening to Woody has nothing to do with this situation. -I think you maybe have a point there. I don't think Woody is causing this. I think you're separately, but convergently evolving. -Say what? -It's what happens when two different species evolve similarly based upon similar environmental pressures. In this case, the threat of extinction. -I don't want to hear about evolution. Am I losing my dick? Yes or no? -Not entirely. I think it's gonna become your clitoris. -My clitoris. Because I'm getting...a vagina? No-- No, that's not happening. You're gonna take this and you're gonna go back and you're gonna do some more research and some more calculations because that's wrong. That's impossible what you're talking about there. -The impossible is happening. -Are you fucking smiling right now? -I'm sorry. -Don't you fucking smile. -It's just incredible, man. -I fail to see how this is incredible. -Scientifically speaking. It's what you said, Billy, life is finding a way. -I was just excited when I said that. -This is what's happening. We may be watching accelerated evolution. -I just... I want it to be something else. I want it to be I got cold. I want it to be I'm getting old and it's shrinking up. Like I saw my grandpa in a shower and it was like half. -Hey, listen, it's just -- Will you hold on for one second? Just hold on. Hold on for one second. -Sure. I'll just hold on. -Here we go. -No problem. -Here we go. -I don't want that. -Take this. -I don't want it. -No, you need to see. Okay? Trust me. It's more than just your penis. Just look. -What do you mean, more? Oh, my God. What is -- Is my sack stretching or is it tearing? What? What is that? -That's your scrotum's raphe line, buddy. -Raphe -- What? -Yeah, it's okay. I think it's just opening back up, you know? -What the fuck do you mean? Opening back up? Don't tell me that's okay. -It starts like that in early embryonic development. And then for dudes, it closes up to make your ball sack. So I'm thinking it's just, you know, reverting back. -Where the hell are my balls gonna go? Oh, God, I'm gonna pass out. I'm passing out. -Don't pass out. -Stop trying to control the situation. Okay? This is my situation, and I still haven't seen enough to prove this theory of yours. You said this was impossible. Okay? If it's impossible, there has to be a rational explanation. Don't -- Don't you dare fucking say that right now. -Say what? -This has nothing to do with your stupid bowling-ball theory. Okay? Ray, listen to me. This is reality. This is my life. This is my balls. -Hey, man. There was a bowling ball, Billy. -Well, you know, I wasn't there, so I'm calling bullshit on that and bullshit on this. -So what do you want to do, man? Just wait and see? I just -- Can you -- Can you just give me, like, a minute? I'm sorry. -It's okay. I'll leave you alone. -I'm sorry. -I'll go check on Woody. You need anything? -Yeah. Could you stop saying that, please? -Yeah, man. I said no more bowling balls. -No, no, Woody. But, yeah, now that you mention it, balls, too. -Wow. -This is gonna take him a while to accept. It's hard to ignore, but it's something that's happening. Add to that, this random green light suddenly appears out of nowhere and... ...everything is feeling a bit unbelievable. And we all know that Billy does not do well with unbelievable. When I was 8, my mom hired a magician for my birthday party. This guy sets up a big white pad of paper on an easel, and he flips through the whole thing. That shows that all the pages are blank and that there's nothing hidden on the inside. And then he asks me, What do I want for my birthday? And I say, "A bowling ball." So he draws one -- big, round circle with three small holes. It's to proportion, and then he hands me the marker, closes the pad and motions for me to step back. And as I do, he opens the pad back up and out drops... -Hey. Billy. Billy? -What the fuck, man? -Just making sure you're okay. -I was -- I was okay. Jesus. -Can I get you anything? -No, I'm trying to sleep. How's it going down there? -I can't hear you under the covers. -I asked if there's any more progress. -Ew! -I know. Sorry. -Leave me alone, man. Leave me alone. -Alright. Let me know if you need anything, okay? -Mnh. -Ahh. -Are you hot? -Mnh-mnh. -What was that? -What was what? -You don't have to let me win just because you feel bad for me, Ray. -Why would I feel bad for you? Hmm? It's your move. Dude, why wouldn't you take the kill? -Because I want to earn my win. -Since when? -What? -You notice it's growing. -What? -Green light. It's growing. -Wait. Are you sure? -Positive. It's definitely gotten bigger since yesterday. -Great. Something else fucking scary to be dea-- Be nice to at least know what it is, you know? -Yeah, it would. But not knowing kind of keeps hope alive. - You -- You -- You know what? I... Maybe this is a good spot to just take a little break. Okay? -We're almost done. - What, I smell or something? -No, no, it's just different. -Nice. -Nice. Why me? Why not you? I'm way more masculine than you. - Sorry. No, you're not. -Look, the movie "Sneakers" is emotional. That wasn't my fault. -Okay, Billy, masculinity has nothing to do with it. Scientifically, I guess it's about which body is better equipped for transformation. -How does that not speak to my masculinity? -You're not the first person to have genitals they don't want. -It's easy for you to say. I want to keep my fucking dick. This is bullshit. There's literally no reason this should be happening to me versus you. -Maybe. -Oh, you think this is my fault. -Us being here is just as much my fault as it is yours. -Bullshit. You don't believe that. -Oh, please, I do. Because I'm the one who put a fucking meat puppet in the White House. Switch. Dude. I said switch, you fucking idiot. -Don't call me a puppet and don't call me a fucking idiot. I did way more than that and you know it. You're just being too big of an asshole to admit it. -Dude, you're right because it would have been better if you'd done nothing rather than all the horrendous shit you did do. -Do you think this is equitable retribution? -Oh, look who's got the big words now. -Fuck you, man. Fuck off. -Fuck you, Dude. I can't believe you were the fucking president, bro, because you fucking sucked! -Occupied. -You know... I think I may go mad in here if two fish are the only people that I have left to talk to. Hey, you guys know I'm a registered Democrat? Yeah. I never deliberately kept that from Billy. Pretty sure he knew and just chose to ignore it. It's always been easier for him to play ignorant rather than, say, have to explain why one of his lead advisers is playing for the other team. It's all about not facing things, right? Especially the shit he can't explain. That's why he always freaks out whenever I say bowling ball. You know... I don't know why I ever thought he would change. What he's going through... ...I can only imagine how scary and confusing this must be for him. And, yeah. I'm glad it's not happening to me. Still, I wish you could see that this is about more than just us. There's goodness in change. Possibility, right? Some people call it hope. I call it magic. Sometimes you can't explain all the magic in the world. -He wore a blue polka dot bow tie. He had curly hair. -Hmm? -At your 8th birthday party. The magician. -Are you admitting you were there? -No. No, I'm not saying that. Memory is a tricky thing. And, you know, I'm thinking maybe my memory might be becoming yours. I don't know. -I never told you that he was wearing a bow tie. Right? -I'm sure you probably -- You probably did. -Billy, you saw a bowling ball, man. -I don't -- I'm not saying what I saw or what I heard. -Okay, sure. -Look. We were fucking kids, okay? And -- And he's a magician. -Right. -That's the whole point, is to stump us. I mean, you know how to pull a quarter out of an ear, right? That's what that is. -But this was more than just a quarter, man. Because I can't hide a bowling ball up my fucking sleeve, bro. Sorry. You said what you heard, right? What you heard. -So what? -What did you hear? -I heard the... the sound of the bowling ball hitting the ground and... You know, that's -- that -- that's how he got it to feel real. -That's because it was real, man. And I was standing right there and you remember it, too. And that's why you never want to talk about it, because then you'd have to face what you saw and what you heard, dude. -Ray, you are so smart. Why are you so fixated on this stupid old trick? -It's because of that thud. It's because of that sound that the bowling ball made. It made that loud thud, and we couldn't explain it, man. That thud was magic becoming real, man. -Dude, I-I'm not trying to be critical. There's a part of me that I fucking love that you believe this. I love that about you. And I feel you. And I know -- I know you're even trying to make me feel better, but it's -- It's kind of making it worse. It's just not what I need right now. -Okay. -Sorry. -It's okay. What do you need right now? That works. -Yeah. You want to start? -Yeah. Yeah. Um... So... We put a hand over? Alright. Yeah. - Yeah. -Okay. We're gathered here today to commemorate and remember...Billy's penis. As advisor to the President, I hereby confer upon you the Presidential Medal of Honor because... ...we thank you for your service. -From the moment I knew you, I loved you. Sometimes I felt I was the one attached to you and not the other way around. You made me feel beautiful and powerful. -Hmm. -I could -- I could take over the world. I could do anything. And... And I let you lead me. And -- And I know -- I know that it wasn't always in the -- in the perfect direction, but I... I think that you -- You had our best interests in mind, I think. Actually, I don't know if that's true. I'm really confused. Uh, it's like I want to say goodbye, but I don't want to say goodbye. I want to... Does that make me a bad person? -No, not at all. You take your time. -Shit. I want to... Oh, f... Okay. Bye. -Goodbye. -You sit tight. I'll be back. -Hey, hey, hey, Riggs. -You're acting strange, man. What's the matter with you? -There's a bomb in that building! There's a bomb in that building. -There's a bomb in that building! You know how I know there's a bomb in that building? 'Cause I got eight days to retirement, and I will not make a stupid mistake. -There is no bomb in that building. I will bet vital parts of my anatomy to the fact. -What's up? -You okay if we watch something else actually? -Hmm...this is my favorite, dude. Come on. It's my pick. -No, I'm just not really in the mood. -What? For the best movie ever? -Oh, come on. This isn't even the best in the series. -Dude, Joe Pesci is great in this one with the white hair, Always freaking out. "Okay. Okay." Come on. I thought you liked this movie because Riggs reminds you of your dad. -No, he does. It's just... I don't know, something about it's kind of making me feel a little sad or something. -Because one of them goes rogue, makes a stupid mistake and blows everything up? -Actually, I hadn't made that parallel before. Thank you for that. -You got it. -No, just, um... It's weird. It's like making me miss the team that -- that we used to be, you know? -What are you talking about? And we're not...No? -I don't know. -Dude. We're still a team, right? A team that's gonna keep watching this shit. Come on, give me that. Give me that. Give me -- -You know what? You know what? It's all good. You win. You win. -We can keep watching. You don't have to... -Come on. -You don't have to let me win. Why are you moving around, man? What's going on? -I gotta go to the bathroom real quick. -You want to wait for you? -No, I'm good. You keep playing. -Okay. -Morning. -Thank you. -Woody. -Did you just make a boner jab? -I was attempting to use some humor to address the elephant in the room. -Okay, fine. You know what? We should talk about it. It's admittedly hard for me -- - Sorry. -I'm trying to be serious. Alright? I am a straight man that hasn't seen a touch of titty in a number of years. Okay? I didn't mean to have a reaction. -Look, it's cool. It's totally cool, man. Alright, I get it. We're like brothers. I was just giving you a little shit, you know? Plus, that wasn't the elephant I was talking about. Go look in the pond. Take a look. Whoa. Holy shit, dude. Oh, my God. Whoo! Oh, and the eggs... -When I say eggs, you say... -What? -63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72... Shit, I may have already counted that one. -I will make an educated guess. -There's just -- There's so many of them. It's crazy. Oh, fuck. No, dude. Sam! -What? -Sam just ate, like, five of his babies. What the fuck? -Sam's probably gonna eat a whole lot more than that. Only 1% actually survive. -They eat their kids? It's -- He's a parent. He's supposed to take care of him. Dude, that's fucked up. -It's okay. We'll have enough. Don't -- -That's -- That's disturbing, man. That's really -- -Yeah. I get it. Do you want to keep counting? -No, no, no. I just need to -- -Okay, calm down. It's all... -Okay. Okay. -How about -- How about I teach you how to warp? -It's not your week. -Yeah, I was up early. I just figured I'd do it. -Huh. Well, thanks. -Wait up. I'll, uh. I'll come with you. -Right on. Okay. Are you ready? -Yeah. Let's do it. -Go. -Oh, shit. This is...different. Um... is it okay if we walk actually? -Yeah. -I'm sorry. -That's okay. So you're up early? -Yeah. I couldn't sleep, so I was just watching the fish, you know, actually kind of getting into the whole cycle of life thing. It's this one little runt in there who's fighting like hell to make it. I'm kind of rooting for her. -What'd you name it? -I haven't yet. I'm, uh, I'm recognizing I might be getting a little too attached already. You know? -You're incredibly self-aware. It's probably good that you recognize that. There's a lot of... -You think we could make a baby? -Hmm? -Do you think we could? Ah, Billy. Billy. -I'm serious. -Alright. Okay. To make a baby, you would need to produce eggs. -Yeah, ovulate. I've read about it. -Okay, so then you probably know that you also have to have a menstruation cycle. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. -Wait. What? -I got my period. -What? Why didn't you tell me? -I don't know. It's -- It's -- It's -- It's personal, you know? And I didn't want you to get all weird about it. Pull out the goggles and want to observe it and, you know... -Was it -- Was it weird? -Yeah, but it was, um... ...powerful. -Oh, my God. -It was really cool. -Holy shit, dude. Wow. Wow. -So... -So what? -So... -What? -So I've been looking at these fish, and I'm watching them become a family. And there is a part of me that is... ...that's starting to ache. -William. What are you -- What are you asking me? -Think about how cool it would be to have a cute little baby around. -You must be out of your goddamn mind. Are you crazy? -What, it's okay for the fish? It's not okay for us? -The fish procreating helps us survive, not having another mouth to feed because you all of a sudden developed a biological clock. -I'm sorry. I thought you were the one who's all hopped up on the wonder of possibility. Bowling ball, bowling ball -- -You're not a scientist, Billy, so I don't expect you to understand. But without proof, I'm not gonna experiment. -Sure, but isn't that what an experiment is? A way to get proof? -No, not in this case it's not. -Well, fine. Okay, then, we already have proof. It's in the pond. There it is. -Humans are not fish. -Right. But you said that we seem to be evolving similarly to the fish. Hold on. Are you not the least bit curious to see if this could actually work scientifically? As a scientist. Science thing. -Scientifically speaking? -Yeah. Mr. Wizard. -I am technically curious about analyzing the prospects of this experiment. Yes, the possibility is exciting, but fuck no, dude. Not the way you're talking about it. Okay? How are you, of all people, even comfortable having this conversation? -Well, if you hadn't noticed, Ray, I'm changing a little bit. I thought you of all people could appreciate that. -Appreciate you wanting to have sex with me?! -What? -You're not -- I thought -- -Dude, no! -No! -Not even. -Okay. -This is... -Okay. My -- Okay. -I'm talking you go into a cup, we insert it into my hole and -- and the legs up and... -Billy, that's not gonna work. -Why not? -Okay, first of all, sperm dies incredibly quickly, okay? You can't just get pregnant by sticking it up in your vagina. -Okay, fair enough. I'm still learning about this stuff. I just thought that could be, like, experiment number one. -And then what? -And then...I don't know. Like, that's where you come in. We start to teamwork. You're the scientist. You got any ideas? -No. -Why can't we talk about it? -Because we can't. -Why not?! -It's too fucking weird. -So you're the registered Democrat, right? -What? -You're the one that's all progressive and shit, huh? -So? -So I don't understand why you're being such a dick about this. -Because you're not a fucking dude anymore. -No, I got lady bits now. Isn't that what you like? -No, dude, it's not what I like. -It was enough to give you a boner last time. -Billy, shut the fuck up. -Shit. You're scared. -I ain't scared of hit, Billy, back up. -Who's being a pussy now? -Come on, dude. -I'll get you there again. -Billy. -You want me to? I'll get you there right now. Come on. I'll get you there. -Billy. -I'm asking you to stop. -Come on. -I'm not a fucking fa... God. Hey, Woody, how you doing in there? Doing all right next to Sam all the time? It's not easy. I get it, you know? He's very smart. He's very charming, talented. Kind of better than you at everything. Yeah, you're not the brightest bulb in the bunch. I know it makes you fussy sometimes, but, um... Do you tell him how much you look up to him? Um... it's important that he knows that. You know, he makes mistakes, but not like you make mistakes, you know? You all know that I ruined the world? That was me. I did that. Um... Sometimes I like to... kind of play it off like it was a mistake, but, um... ...I think I knew what I was doing. I just wish I knew then what I know now, you know? -Me too. Sorry, man. -No, I'm sorry. -No, I can turn around. -Thanks. -Mm-hmm. You know the family that I came from, Billy. A man was a man with a very narrow, rigid definition of what that meant with no room to vary. -Yeah, man, I get it. My parents were super homophobic, too. -It's more than that, man. And that mold of men and manliness... it is so ingrained in me, bro. And I spent my whole life trying to be a more open person. But when pushed... ...I just defaulted back into those old molds. Scares me how quick that switch could be flipped back on. -Yeah. I know you. I known you my whole life, and you are way more than those shitty impulses. We got to be more than that, right? -I should have stopped you back then. -I should have let you, you know. When I asked you to build me this thing, I... I-I never thought we were gonna need it, man. I just... -I did. -You d-- Really? -I had a hunch. -I mean, I just -- I just gave you this task because... I was just trying to distract you. -How so? -All the managing. You know, like, the... I just wanted to get away from it. I'd -- I'd -- I'd finally made it and I... Yes. With help. But... I just wanted to prove I could do it on my own without you being my -- my secret sauce all the time. -Yeah. I never showed you how to warp because I liked having special powers over you. Helped me not feel under you. -I didn't mean to make you feel under me. -I know, but you did. -Yeah, that -- that's not all on me, though, dude. I wasn't... Sorry. Let me s-- I think a lot of the way I was acting there, that -- I was just afraid, you know, because you're -- -I saw that. And I kept pushing. -I kept, um...managing... -...to the point where you just pushed me away. Relegated me to go build you a dome. -Well... ...it is an excellent dome. -Hey, thanks, man. -Yeah. Just can't help but think about all the... ...incredible things you could have done for the world... if I had... ...given you the space for that, you know. -Fuck yeah. Also don't give yourself that much credit. Alright? Just... -Anyway about that whole procreation thing... that was a dumb idea and probably wouldn't have worked anyway, so... -It actually could work really. -W-- W-- Then why couldn't we even just talk about it? -Besides the obvious, dude? I don't know, but I just... We don't even know if your body could handle the pregnancy. -Yeah, we could lose the baby. -No, Billy, dumb ass. I'm worried about losing you. -You want to go play a game? -Sure. -We have to keep it purely scientific. There's potential for advancement, then... I guess you could say I wouldn't be a very good scientist if I didn't at least try to test for all possible outcomes. -Uh, yeah, I mean, that makes sense. -Mm-hmm. -So... -So. -Yeah, so, uh... should we start with my idea? You know, like, you in the cup and I... -Yeah. Come on, dude. I literally question whoever taught you sex ed, man. -We were in the same class. -Like, I was the one who asked about the precum on the tip. -They would say anything to get us to not stick it in before marriage. -Okay, so what about senior year? Remember Scotty? He claimed he pulled out, but he still got his girlfriend pregnant. -Of course I remember, 'cause it freaked you out. -Yeah. I didn't lose my virginity until sophomore year of college. Because that's... -That's not why you didn't. -Don't do that. Don't do that. Point is, he pulled out, a little bit got in, and -- and she got pregnant. So that is a strategy that could maybe work for us? -Not only did I never believe that, because it's damn near impossible, it also sounds like you're asking me to jack off into your crotch. -I just don't know how to do this non-sexually. I'm trying to, like -- -Okay. -I'm spitballing. -No, wait, hold on. That's a good point. Since when is trying to make a baby actually sexy? Remember when a bunch of our friends were going crazy trying to get pregnant? There's nothing sexy. -It was like they were showing up for an oil change. - Right? -Temperature checks, fluid checks. -Feeling warm. -Here comes the calendar. -Is that the right temperature? Yeah. It's just mechanical. -That's it. -All about making a baby. -That's it. Keep your eye on the prize. You focus up. -Exactly. We just got to figure out our mechanics now. -What's our formula? -Right. -You know, we got the A plus B equals C, and then we got to put the P and the V, and then voila. -Scientifically speaking, I like that. -Okay, okay. -There you go. -Okay. -Alright, so, um... So, A. -What's A? -A is I lay down. Yep. Right? -Okay. -I'll start... You know, I just lay here. If I lay like this? -And then I would just have to, you know, get hard somehow. -We could put on some music. -Nah, that's too sexy-time. -I could show you my tits. -You could. -But I wouldn't want you to do that. That's way too much. No, we need to keep this mechanically focused. -Okay. I could just literally not move. -Yeah, that might work. And then I would just... I would just get on top and get right in there. -That's it. -You probably have to move a little bit to let me in, though, right? -Yeah, right. -Yeah. -Get you an angle. -Yeah, okay. Yeah, I like that. Ain't nothing sexy about that. -Okay. -Yeah. -I mean, that's... -Whoaaaahh-ahhhh! -We're gonna get -- -Billy, you talking about right now? You want to do this? -I feel like if we keep talking about it, we're just gonna wimp out. We got to get in there, deposit and get out. -Oh, shit. Yeah. Okay. Right. A-Agreed. -Okay, so I'll do this. You just look away. Don't look at my face. -I'm not gonna look at anything. -I'll get doing this. -I think the hair on your legs, though, might throw me off a little bit, right? -Well, I can pull these down. -I know, but I think, like, all your hair, like the face and the head and all of this stuff, the hair. -Right, just the whole... Right, right. Okay, well, look, you'd already be hard then, so you could just close your eyes. -I don't think -- I think it might be dangerous for me to walk around with, like, my eyes closed and a -- and a boner out. You know what I mean? -Yeah, that's a good point. -That's what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking. -Okay, how do we get our crotches to touch but nothing else and also not see anything? -I don't know. -Okay, okay. Um... I'm getting, like, half an idea here. -Okay. -Um... You -- You get rampin'. -We're still doing it? We're still doing it now, though, right? -Yep. -Yep? Okay. -We can take a bit. -Got it. -Okay, so you get going. I'm gonna go away for a second, but you just don't think about my my face or my hairy legs or anything, okay? And then when you're ready, I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna make sure that you don't see anything you don't want to see. -How are you gonna do that? -I don't know yet. I'm gonna figure it out. But let's get you -- You go behind the TV. -That's where I'm going? -You get it. Okay. -I'm going over here. -Alright. -Okay. - You got this. - Thank you. -I believe in you! -Okay. Oh. Ohh. What's going on? -Don't worry about it. Don't worry about me. You just think boobs and ass. - Boobs and ass. Titties. -You let me know when you get close. -Stop talking. Mm. Okay. Alright. Okay, I'm all set. Don't say anything. I'm just gonna come straight over in here. Alright, here we go. Alright. Ooh! Oh, shit. Dude, this is the plan? -You -- You want me to answer? You told me not to talk. -You look like a one-eyed ghost! -Just stick it in the hole, dude. -Ahh! Stick it in the mother-- Okay. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. You okay? -Yeah, I'm good. You okay? -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it's a vagina. -Oh, fuck. Mm. Hey. -Hey. -Are you okay? -Yeah, I--I am. Are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah. I think I am. -Alright, Ray. We want fast? We want slow? What are we feeling? -Uh, you pick. -It's my pick. -Okay. May I have a tomato, please? -One tomato coming up. -Oh! -What are you doing? What are you doing? -Okay. It's coming. Ready? -I don't believe you. -Whoa-whoa-oh! Oh! -It's okay. NOW I'm feeling it. -We got a shaker. I got it it in the back. I got it in the back. -That's good. That's good. Come on. That's good. It's good. Oh, no, now you're not gonna get up. -Oh, hell, no, dude. -Come on. Why not? -Because what if it's a girl? -Why can't a girl be named Mario? It's symbolic. This baby is gonna be like the new mascot for the future of humans. -Oh, my God. I don't think I like the idea of our child being a mascot or named after an inside joke, regardless of what gender it is. -You know, I've been thinking about that a little bit lately. -About what? -About gender. -How so? -Well, now that I am growing life in the belly, I'm... I'm kind of feeling a little confused about it. -How so? -Well, I always thought I was a man, you know? -Mm-hmm. -But is that just because, like, I had the parts and that's who I was told that I was? -So you don't think you're a man? -No, I... I actually do think I am a man. And I think that's what's confusing me, you know? It's like -- -Yeah. So you're... You're you. -Yeah. Yeah, I like that. -Thank you. That's great, because then I get to keep calling you "dude." Oh, hell, yeah. Always, dude. Come on. Oh, God. It's so good. -You like that, don't you? - Stop it. - Yeah. Take that shit. -Oh, dude, it's so good. -Oh, my God. Jesus, dude. It smells like you got strep butt. -What? Wait, I'm a pregnant person. -I can taste it. -Hey, don't stop rubbing. -Not if you're gonna keep farting in my face. Alright? -Dude, I'm making life in my belly. That's just the exhaust that comes from the factory, okay? That's just -- Well, you don't have to get all morose about it. I mean, it's just -- -I'm not. -Oh, you're thinking about it again, aren't you? -No, I'm not thinking about it. -Hey. Hey. -You can't be worrying about it like this, alright? There's only so much we can do to prepare. The baby's going to do its thing. We just got to hope my hole opens up wide enough and... That's where you normally go, "That's what she said." -Yeah. -You know? I set you up for that. You think we deserve this baby? -I don't know. I know I blame you. -It literally is my fault, so... -It's not your fault. If it wasn't you, it would have been somebody else. You're just a product of our species. I guess the real question that I don't know about is, do humans deserve another chance? -How are you feeling about that green light these days? -I don't know. More to lose now if it's bad. -Mm. -What is it? -What is it? -I don't know. It sounds like a storm. -What? Wouldn't that mean...? Oh, God. Oh, careful. -Okay. Ray, what's going on? Ray! What do you see? Ray! -It's okay. It's just the outer layer. - Ahh! -Here, take this! Go grab the bedsheets! Come on! Come on. Watch your feet! Hold tight! -I can't! -Yeah, you can. You okay? -Can't breathe. -You gotta get up to the pod. -I can't. -Come on! Come on! You got it! I got you. -What are you doing? -We need to empty it. -No, Ray, no! -This is the only thing that's strong enough to hold. -They'll die, Ray, no! -We may die if we don't get that thing closed. One, two... -Just go. -Hook it up. -Shit. Oh, shit. -We gotta get up. -Wait, do you see that? Do you see that? -I don't know what I'm seeing. -Yeah. We can see. Look at all this. It's like the sky is opening back up. -This damage is extensive. -Yeah, but we can fix it, right? Right? -There's too much. We don't have the supplies to tackle all this, and there's multiple places where we're down to the inner stratum. -Yeah, but that's why we have two. -You know, I'm gonna go clean up, see what we can salvage from the pond. -What about all this? How's it looking? -I'd say we have enough food for maybe 40 meals if we ration. Actually, probably less than that, since you're eating for two. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. -I shouldn't have done this. -No, come on. Come on. Look. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You had no option, okay? You were thinking fast in the moment. You were saving us. -I killed us, Billy. -Hey. -Hmm. -I've been doing some research. -Oh, wow. This really is the end of the world. -I can read some science shit. Are you not curious what's going on out there? -I don't have time to sit and read right now, man. -Alright. Sorry. What can I do to help? -Could you grab some plastic wrap? I'm gonna try to keep these things as fresh as possible. -Where is...? -Over there. -Yeah. I knew that. Hey, Ray? -Hmm? -Now that I'm being all helpful and stuff, wanna hear what I'm researching? -Humor me. -Alright. So as you can see outside -- We don't know what we're seeing. -Well, something could be better than nothing, right? -Sure. -Jesus, when did I turn into the optimist here? What is happening? Okay. Okay. Alright, fine. Tell you what. Humor me for a second here, okay? Alright. What if others survived? -You mean, like, if other world leaders had their own Luigi to save their ass? -I mean, basically, yeah. You know, they... They could be out there somewhere, you know? Maybe living in their own bunker thingy. Maybe they're pregnant, too. I mean, who knows, dude? -Even if that were -- We can't go outside. -Oh, look, who knows so much. You see, this is where my research comes in. Because remember how I was saying it looked like the sky was opening up? -Yeah. -Well, I read some stuff about the sky in your little book over here, okay? You okay if I get some fishy hands on your book? Sorry. So there's something called the troposphere layer, alright? And apparently that's where weather happens, okay? Now, I'm not like, a scientist or... Oh, my God, that smells awful. Sorry. Blech. I'm not a meteorologist, right? But last night, that seemed like some weather shit to me. Alright? And it also says you can't have weather unless you have an atmosphere. You see what I'm saying? Could I be kind of right? And the green light was maybe our atmosphere coming back or something like that? -I mean, it wouldn't be that simple. -Well, alright. Fair enough. You have taught me that nothing in life is simple, but... I mean, I just -- Are you gonna make me be the one to call the magic word or what? I mean, come on. -Really? -We're down to limited food again. Now we have limited supplies in a dome that may not hold much longer, and we have a baby on the way. I know. We have to start thinking logically at some point. I get it. -Want coffee? -Thanks. -Enjoy it. It might be the last. -See, it's not too bad. -Did you know just one dude created Mario Brothers? -What? No. -You knew this whole time and you didn't-- -You know, it kept you busy. -Get out! Get the f-- Get out! Get the f-- You son of a bitch. That's crazy. I was just thinking about those dudes this morning. -Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm. -I don't think you're just Luigi anymore. -So you do admit that you thought of me as your Luigi? -No, no, no, I was gonna say that you're not just Luigi anymore, and I'm not just Mario. -Because you read one science book? -No. Yes. But it's true, man. I think we're both. Or like, we take turns. Sometimes I'm Mario. Sometimes you're Luigi. Sometimes you're the secret sauce. Sometimes I am. It's kind of like... -We're partners. -Team. This time, with a new mission. -Oh, yeah? What's that? -Well, we got to save this 8 pounds of magic in my belly, right? Look, man. The thing about us having to start to think logically, you know? I get it. I'm hearing you. But, um, none of this is logical. -I mean, look at me. -I'm me, and I'm pregnant. And more fish were made. I mean, we're kind of fucked that up a little bit, but... And after years, years of darkness in here, a fucking green light came and a storm. So yes, yes, I know there is no logical reason whatsoever that we should continue to survive, but, dude... You know what? Hold this. I want -- I want to show you something. -Okay. -Alright. Close your eyes. -What is this, dude? Some kind of trust exercise? -I don't trust you for shit. You one of them squinty peepers. Turn around. Turn around. Okay. Don't look. -I'm not looking. -Don't look. Hold on. Okay. You can turn around. I'm sorry. I know that you and I disagree on what actually went down that day. -What? -How it went down. Whether I was there or not. What we heard or didn't hear. -Alright, yeah. Got it. -As you can see, the pad is empty. But I think we can agree on one thing. A man walked into a room that day and where there was previously no bowling ball... suddenly... ...there was an 8-pound bowling ball. -Okay. -And because of that... and because of this... we know that things happen that we cannot explain. And no matter how hard and scary things get... ...there's room for hope. So... Would you like to try and prove your magic theory once and for all, my friend? -Billy. -Hey, no peeking. -Okay, done.
