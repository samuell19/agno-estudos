Santa's sleigh-- How does he land here if there's no snow? [car horn] Move it! Mom? I don't know how anyone deals with Christmas around here. Although we're new to the area, My agency handles every aspect of small business marketing. In fact we optimize public awareness through... Look, I'm really not interested. You know, if I could just show you a few samples of my work. I'm not interested, lady. It's Christmas Eve! Can't you see I'm busy? Any more business meetings today, mom? Well, if we... Can you help me pick these up? Mom, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking, Um, okay, no more business today. We'll head home. What do you say? Okay. Look, mom, little tiny Christmas stockings. Oh, yeah, those are cute, honey. Come on. They're two dollars. Oh, no, thank you. Merry Christmas. Oh, Merry Christmas to you. Hey, Judy! Check it out. I made a new list for Santa. I emailed it this morning. Wow, that's a lot of stuff. I've been good. Hello, Molly. Oh, hi, Doris. Merry Christmas. Doing last minute shopping? Oh, you know. Me, too. Don't you just love this weather? They say it's going to be the hottest Christmas on record. It's different. You'll get used to it. Beats shoveling all that snow, huh? Gosh, I love the sunshine. Sunshine doesn't agree with me. Why's that? Well I burn. I burn real badly. Oh, dear. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Okay, Brian, we've got to go get some charcoal For our Christmas bar-b-cue. Okay. I'll see you around. Bye, Judy. Merry Christmas. Do you think Santa gets a sunburn like you? Well, he's suppose to be Scandinavian, isn't he? I thought he was from the north pole. Well, you know. Scandinavian descent is what I meant. Mom, does Santa have high cholesterol like dad? Where do you come up with this stuff? Well, if he eats milk and cookies At every house in the world, couldn't he be at risk? But I think he probably has a great cardiologist. Bill? Yeah, hello, honey. Are you still at work? Ah! What? Yes, I'm still here. When are you getting home? Oh, I don't know. They have a company tradition Of having a Christmas pool party. I just wish someone would have told me. I take it you're a little over-dressed. Oh, that would be an under-statement. Let me know when you're on your way. I have a few stops for you to make. Yeah, I remember. I gotta get Judy's Panda play-pal set, right? I'll stop and get that on the way home. Okay, thanks. Bye. Oh, oh, oh. Welcome back. I knew that wire tap would pay off. I knew he'd come back. You're good, chief. Should I get the shotgun? Nope. That won't be necessary. Just cover me. Welcome to town, Max. Is that you, Spivak? It's Chief Spivak. And you're under arrest. What are you talking about? What for? Oh, I think you know. Outstanding warrants. What about my bike? Don't you worry about that. You won't be needing it where you're going. Yeah, welcome back. Mike! Mikey, come on. That your girlfriend? So, are you making some new friends? Mom! Can we just go? Mikey, did you ask Santa for a new skateboard? Mike asked for an encyclopedia program To help him with his homework. Yeah. Mister Emerson, the budget meeting has been moved And the board of directors Needs the revised expansion proposal. Carla, Carla. It's Christmas Eve. I'm going home. And the city called. They say there aren't enough proposed Parking spaces for the New Year's celebration. They won't give you a permit, and they need to talk to you. You would think for one day out of the year I wouldn't have to take home piles of work? That's not all. The event staff said... Carla, Carla We'll deal with it on Thursday. I'm sorry, Mr. Emerson, but I'm on vacation. Merry Christmas. Oh, Judy, those are beautiful, honey. Good job. Yes, I was holding for Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey's in a meeting right now. I understand. May I have your name please? Molly Emerson. Hold on one moment. Thank you. Now do we put them in the oven? The oven, the sidewalk. It's all hot. Hey. Daddy! Hey, how's my little peanut? Good. We're making cookies. Mmm, yummy. Miss Emerson? Mr. Bailey's got a flight to catch. Yes, I understand but if I could just... Yes, he's off to China on holiday. I'll see that he's got your number And that he calls you back. Okay, thank you. Cheers. Happy Christmas. You, too. Hi, honey. Who was that? The Bailey account. Oh, good news? No news. Dad, I was wondering, why does Santa wear red? Um, probably so airplanes can see him When he's flying around. Oh. So, how was the Christmas party? Judy, honey, why don't you go find your brother So mommy and I talk for a minute. -Okay? -Okay. She's been obsessed about Santa all day. Did you get the panda play-pal? They were all out of pandas. The new shipment didn't come in. I went to three separate stores looking for him. Oh! All they had left was the talking Teddy. The talking Teddy? [bear:] yo, whass-up, homey? This is the "trash-talking Teddy." I didn't catch that. No wonder it was the only thing left. Your Christmas bonus? What's that? That's my Christmas bonus. It's a turkey! It was a frozen turkey when I left work. Oh, Bill, please tell me your joking. Come on. You’re joking, huh? I wish I were. No!!! They move us out here, Away from our friends and family. Away from my job. They work you like a dog, and this is? This is your Christmas bonus? Well, I got to go to the pool party. [phasers firing] Why didn't you ask Santa for a new skateboard? Because I knew I wouldn't get it. But you've been good. Being good has nothing to do with it. Maybe we made a mistake moving out here. Honey, we both said we were gonna give it a Chance. Well, maybe we were wrong. I mean, between your work, and the stress. And my career is the ghost of Christmas past. I know, I know. And this unbearable heat. No way can I feel any kind of Christmas spirit. It doesn't feel like Christmas. I need snow, and cold weather, And Jack frost nipping at my nose. I can nip at your nose. But Santa always brings me what I ask for When I've been good. Man! Look Judy, I'm getting an encyclopedia program Because that's what mom and dad want me to get. But if you ask Santa... Santa's not real. He's imaginary. Look, Santa Claus is just made up. For little kids like you. Santa is real! I know it! Mommy, mommy! What's the matter, honey? Mikey said Santa Claus is make-believe. Oh, honey. Mike's just teasing you. I am not. Mike! She's old enough. She might as well know. What's the matter with you? It's Christmas Eve. So? It doesn't even feel like Christmas around here. I knew when I was her age. Knew what? Mommy, Santa is real, isn't he? Of course he is. -Honey. No, no! Santa Claus is real. I know he is. Yeah, honey. He is real in our imaginations. No. He's a real person. He comes down the chimney and delivers toys To all the boys and girls in the world. Judy, he's real As long as you believe he's real. No! You're all wrong! He is real. And I'll prove it. What? You think I can depend on you boys To uphold law and order around here tonight? You can count on us, chief. Have we ever let you down? Lately? I mean, not counting the Thanksgiving day incident. Ha, ha! That wasn't our fault. We had no way of knowing that was mayor Davis In that turkey suit? Just keep the peace, all right, boys? And don't bother me unless... [together:] it's an absolute emergency. Roger that. 10-4, chief. Oh, chief, about the prisoners? You want us to delouse 'em? Nah. That won't be necessary. Let Clifford stay until morning, Let him sleep it off. Max, on the other hand. He's gotta stay until Monday morning-- Have a visit with judge burns. You're gonna keep me locked up On Christmas, Spivak? That's right. Don't I get something to eat, Spivak? You can have breakfast in the morning. Ho. Ho. Ho. You have a merry Christmas now, sir. Thank you. You too. 10-4, sir. Looks like it's just me and you, partner. Looks like. Who knows. Maybe we'll solve a big case And get our picture in the paper. Yeah, that'd be so cool. Hey, Buckley-- How come we always gotta work Christmas Eve? Yeah. I wanna wait for Santa. You know Santa won't show up unless you're asleep. I bet he will. You willing to risk all those Christmas presents? All right then, hit the sack, soldier. Sleep tight. Ha, ha. Should I put these under the tree? Oh, they can wait until morning. It really doesn't matter anymore. I feel bad for Judy. Oh, these kids just grow up too fast. I know. Is seems like Christmas isn't what it used to be. Well, what do you want to do? Move back east? Oh, I don't know. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just depressed. About Christmas? Yeah, that and the fact that I used to be somebody. A year ago I was an account exec on Madison avenue. And now I can't even get anybody to return my calls. Honey-- You'd probably feel a lot better if we were Back east with a big, huge, white blanket of snow. Yeah. A white Christmas would be magic. You know I could crank the air conditioning way up high, And we get out a comforter. Pretend like we're back east? Nah, it doesn't matter. Christmas is just another day. Well, merry just another day! Very funny. [meow] [meow] Whoa, there. Aaugh! Ohh! How's this? That's cute. Mmm! Looks good. Mmm! [meow] Oh. Whoa!!! Oh!!! Let me out!!! Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Look, let me out of here now! Help!

Who are you? It's Christmas Eve. You were expecting the Easter bunny? Yes, yes. Hello, is this the police? We have an intruder in our house. No, no, no. I'm not an intruder. You left cookies and milk. How'd you get in here? How do you think? I came down the chimney. Santa, Santa, I knew you'd come! Merry Christmas, Judy. Oh, and thank you for the cookies. They were delicious. Me and mommy made them. Judy, stay back! Yes. 1225 Navidad Lane. Please hurry. Thank you. They're on their way. Whoa! Radical disguise, dude. Oh, no Mike, this is no disguise. How'd you know my name? I know everyone's name. I'm Santa. I told you. Kids, go upstairs, please. But, mom! Now! Hey, just keep your hands Where I can see them, fat boy. Oh, please, Bill. I'm not fat. Just big-boned. How does he know all our names? Have you been stalking us? I know everyone's name. It's in my job description. Will you go upstairs, please. No, mom! I wanna see dad bop him. Would you go upstairs! I'm not gonna bop anyone. Unless, of course, I have to. Easy now, Bill. Don't raise that blood pressure. We all know where that can lead to. What are you going to do with him, dad? I'm sending him to jail. Where he belongs. Oh. We'll hold him overnight and you can come by In the morning and file a complaint. Overnight! No, that won't do. Quiet! Bill, think this over. [crying] Name? Let's see now, I go by several names. Kris Kringle, saint Nicholas, Father Christmas... Why don't you just tell me The one that's on your driver's license? I don't have a driver's license. Most people in these parts like to refer to me as Santa Claus. You got any id? I don't usually need it, you know? [phone ringing] Spivak. Evenin', chief. Buckley, this better be good. Sorry to bother you, sir. But we picked up a prowler On a breaking and entering over on Navidad Lane. Anybody hurt? No, no, sir. We got the perpetrator in custody And it's all under control. It's just I had a question, sir. He has no id and he claims his name is Santa Claus. Santa Claus? Yes, sir. Do you think that's funny, Buckley? I mean he's got the beard and the suit. It's not the mayor, is it? Definitely not, sir. We checked. But I've got to admit He's the most convincing Santa Claus I've ever seen. But I am Santa Claus. You be quiet. Buckley, it's Christmas Eve. I thought I told you not to disturb me Unless its an absolute emergency. And I do apologize, sir. It's just that I don't know What to put down on the report. Run his prints. Add vagrancy to the charges. I will deal with it in the morning. And Buckley, do not call me again Unless it's a life or death situation. Roger that, chief. Sorry to bother you, sir. You have a merry one, now. And, Buckley? Yes, sir? Get you feet off my desk. Yes, sir. Brian? Brian, is that you? Get off the phone and go to bed. Santa Claus. Okay, Santa Claus it is. Back off! Merry Christmas, Max. What so merry about it? [footsteps] [footsteps] Bill. Honey, wake up please I think there's somebody on the roof. What? What are you talking...?

Bill, speak to me. Daddy?! Sweet. Honey, say something. There. There. What is it? What did you see? Reindeer. Santa's reindeer? Yeah, yeah. They were Santa's reindeer. They just took off from our roof. See? I told you. Bill, we have to get you to the hospital, now. No, no, no, I'm fine. Look, look. Honey, I know what I saw. It was the most amazing thing. I think you have a concussion. No, honey, I'm fine. Yes, I do. They were waiting for Santa. Yeah, that's right. They were waiting for Santa. I know. Okay, daddy isn't feeling well right now. Daddy's in shock and I'm calling an ambulance. No, no, no, honey. I'm fine. Daddy, you've got to get Santa out of jail. Santa. She's right. Santa. Bill, Bill. Oh, no, she's right. I've gotta go to the police station And bail out Santa. Are you out of your mind?! Bill, honey, I really think we need to get you to the hospital. The hospital? No. Santa's down at the police station. I gotta go down there and get him out. Listen to yourself. You're talking crazy. No, mommy, he's right. Look. I'm just gonna go down there, I'm gonna drop all the charges. And then I'm gonna be back in a jiffy. Bill? Wait. Bill, Bill? Cool, mom. Dad's gone totally bonkers. Heh, heh. A lot of bad Santas here. [phone plays jingle bells] Should we answer it? Hello? Boss, this is elf one. You're way behind schedule. What are your coordinates? Who are you trying to reach? Wait, who is this? What are you doing on Santa's hotline? This is officer Buckley of the... Officer Buckley, hold on. Oh, the same dufus that arrested mayor Davis on Thanksgiving? Hey, now. Wait a minute. That was a mix up and it wasn't our... No, you hold on. Put Santa on the phone, now! Can't do that, he's incarcerated. You sure are a few nuts short of a fruitcake, You know that? Hey, now, wait a minute, mister. No. Unless you want to be Responsible for ruining Christmas for all eternity, You'll put Santa on the phone, now. We'll see about that. Hello. Hello? Who was it? Some wiseguy. Officer Buckley, was that for me? Nope, wrong number. Wrong number? That's impossible. I've gotta get out of here. If I don't make my appointed rounds tonight It will ruin my perfect record. Millions of children all over the world Will lose Faith in me. It will nullify my very existence, Max. Look. I don't know you. And you don't know me. So how do you know my name is Max? I know everybody's name. Did you used to ride with the scorpions? No, I ride with the reindeer. I never heard of them. Merry Christmas, Clifford. Oh, no, there's two of you. I'm seeing double again. You've had too much Christmas cheer, Clifford. [snoring] Drop the charges?! Yeah, that's right. I changed my mind. Mr. Emerson, this low life perpetrator Broke into your home. You know, he didn't really break in. I mean it was all kind of a misunderstanding. I think I can help you get out of here. Yeah. I'm supposed to be out of here anytime now. Really, a friend of mine Is suppose to come down here and bail me out. You think you can fit into this? Well, he has no proof of identity And now we have the question of the vagrancy charge. I can vouch for him. Can you tell me his name? Uhh. Ummm, Claus. He likes to be called Santa. Anyway, look, its Christmas Eve, guys. Let's just forget about the whole thing? What about our picture in the paper? If I don't press the charges Then you can't really keep him here. Am I right about that? Maybe you should call the chief. I don't think we should bother him. No. If that's the way you want it, sir. I think that would be best. Okay, Calhoun, get the prisoner. Okay, yes, sir. Thanks. Okay, Santa, this is your lucky night. No, no, wait, wait. I'm Santa Claus. Yeah, right. Nice try. No, no, please, officer. Stay put. No, no, you don't... Put a lid on it. Just let me explain Officer Calhoun. Wait, wait, wait a minute. I, I'm Santa Claus. Oh, Santa. I hope you're gonna forgive me. I, I mean I had no idea. Ho, ho, ho. Thanks a lot, fellas. [Santa:] I'm Santa Claus. Officer, wait! Merry Christmas. Feliz Navidad. Well, you win some. You lose some. Jelly donut, partner? You buying? Why not, it's Christmas. Then I want a sticky bun. [snoring] Santa? Hello, Brian. Look what I got. I got blueberry again and I asked for raspberry. Sometimes when they don't have a sticky bun I get a bear claw. You can put the blueberry away for later. I'll eat that. I like the raspberry. You left the cell open! No, I didn't. Well, then I guess It was one of Santa's elves that did it, huh? I know I locked it back up. I swear I did. We've got to find that biker Or the chief is gonna have our hides. This isn't the way to the Emerson house. I thought we were going to my house. No, no, no. I've gotta get my sleigh first. Here, this way. Okay. Santa, why are you dressed in leather? Oh, it's my new look. I think I like the old look better. Yes, me too. Did you get the toys I asked for? Now, Brian, you've got to wait until morning. I've got some more stuff that I added to my list. Oh, really. Why doesn't that surprise me? A baseball glove, a slot car track, Game station 3, a pony... Hey, look who I've got. Daddy. Santa! Bill, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I really think we should get you to a doctor. That was quite a fall you took No, I'm fine, honey. Look, I've got Santa. Do you really think it's a good idea To bring a stranger back into our house? Honey, he's not a stranger. He's Santa Claus. Hey, Santa, cool biker ring. Oh, thanks, kid. The reindeer left. So, uh, are you gonna call them back or something? The reindeer? They a biker gang? Biker gang? No, the reindeer on the roof? With the sleigh and presents. Oh, those reindeer. Santa's reindeer. Yeah. Your reindeer. My reindeer? Yeah. So, you gonna call them back? I'd love for you to show them to my wife. She's a kind of a skeptic. You know? So, they coming back? They'll be back. Rudolf just went out to get something to eat. By the way, you got any grub around here? There's more cookies. I'm talking about real grub, little lady. Can I, uh, talk to you a minute? Oh, yeah, sure. There's plenty of food in the fridge, Santa. Just, help yourself. I'll show him. No, Judy. Mike. Go get the 9 iron. You gonna bop him, mom? Just go. Bill, if this is some kind of practical joke or something. Honey, honey, honey. You gotta understand. He's the real thing. He is Santa Claus. [crash] Bill, there is no such thing as Santa Claus. Uh-uh! A football helmet, A titanium space commando action figure, A cd player... That's quite a tall order there, Brian. Oh, I'm not done just yet. I didn't think so. Let's see, where was I? Oh, yeah, a cd player, a kite, an ant farm... [crash] Want some more cookies, Santa? Sure. [mumbling] Um, I don't think that's the right Santa. What do you mean? Um, he's got a tattoo. "born to be bad." Not exactly the holiday sentiments You'd expect from Santa Claus. Here, mom. You gonna bop him now? I think I've made a terrible mistake. We've let the good chief down. He entrusted us to keep the peace, and now look. We've got us an escaped prisoner on our hands. It was your idea to go for jelly donuts. It wasn't jelly donuts That forgot to lock that holding cell. I'm telling you, that cell was locked. Yeah, well, all I'm saying is we need to find him. Maybe we should talk to that Santiago guy. He shared the cell. Maybe he knows something. That's a good idea. Now you're thinking, partner. Let's go! You're not Santa. You're an impostor! Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, kid. Obviously, there been a mistake. They must have given me The wrong Santa at the police station. The wrong Santa? Yeah. Duh! [phone rings] Oh, can I get that? No. Who could be at this time of night? It could be Bailey. They said he was in china. [phone:] hi, you've reached the Emerson's, Bill, Molly, Mike, and Judy. Please leave a message after the beep. [Bailey:] hello? I'm trying to reach Molly Emerson. Sorry I haven't gotten back to you earlier. But I'm calling from Hong Kong, And quite honestly... It is the Bailey account. Oh, I've gotta get that! Forget it. It's urgent that we speak immediately. No, no, no. I can be reached at... No! No! There goes the Bailey account. Honey, I am so sorry. Ow! What were you thinking Bringing this savage into our home? I'm not a savage. Look, just take anything you want. But leave my family alone. I don't want your stuff. I just need to borrow your car. Oh, well, yeah. Go ahead, take it. Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay, honey. [doorbell] You expecting anybody? No. [doorbell] Now, I want everybody to be quiet. I mean real quiet! Bill? Shh! Gnarly! Ha, ha.

Sit down, both of you. You just wait until I tell my dad. Brian, this is Max. He used to be a good little boy, just like you. Yeah, and where'd that get me? Behind bars! [phone playing jingle bells] Oh, that must be for me. Better let me take it. What? Yes? Officer Buckley. For the last time, let me speak with Santa. Who's officer Buckley? Who is this? Who's this? Who is this? Who's this? I asked you first! Who's this?! This is elf one. And you're in violation of The north pole yuletide communication act By being on this line. Now put Santa on! He's mad. You'd better let me talk. Sorry, pal, wrong number. Hello? Rats! Special ops? We've got trouble, boys. Looks like we're going to have to call in the "specialist." The elves are probably worried sick. I'm way, way, behind schedule. Alright, tell you what. You give me back my leathers. Lights are still on. Must be having a party. Alright sit down. You're the real Santa, aren't you? Of course he's the real Santa. I busted him out of my dad's jail. Hold on. Did you say, "your dad's jai" That's right. My dad's the chief of police. And he's gonna get you, fatso. You'll see. You're a Spivak. What's it to you, tough guy? Brian, would you zip it? We don't want any more trouble. Where are the keys to your car? [doorbell] Now what? [doorbell] Get rid of 'em, or else! Come on. Good evening again, Mr. Emerson. Ma'am. Sorry to bother you, sir. We were wondering if we could Have a word with your friend, Mr. Uh, Claus. I'm sorry but we're kind of tied up He means he's not here. Can you tell us where he is? No, we don't know where he is. He was here and then he... He left. Is something wrong with your neck? A knot. You know, like a knot. You have something in your eye, ma'am? Yes. Something really nasty got in here. Real nasty. Really nasty got in here. See the thing is, we're in somewhat of a bind. Bind? You mean like in bound? Oh, we know all about bound. No, not like that. Um, bare with me folks. See, we have an escaped prisoner on our hands. You don't say. Right, ma'am. Since your friend, uh. Santiago. Yeah. He shared the cell with him tonight. We were hoping he could shed a little light on the situation. I'm sure he could. Yeah. Well, like we said, he's not here. [Santa's cell phone rings] Jingle bells. That sounds like his cell phone. ♫ That's some presents I wrapped this morning for my kids. They've just been tinkling away all day. [singing along] ♪ jingle all the way... ♪ Do you have his telephone number? No. I mean, yes. 555-1225. Okay then. Well, we'll call from the squad car. Sorry to bother you so late, folks. Have a Merry Christmas. Would you like to come in for some hot cocoa? Ohh! It's a little too hot for cocoa. Thanks just the same. Cocoa? Well, it's Christmas. What was that number? 555-1225. You little doggies did a good job. Now, you just relax. [phone rings] Oh, I'll get it. No, you won't. [phone message:] hi, you've reached the Emerson's Bill, Molly, Mike, and Judy. Please leave a message after the beep. That's strange. I thought this was Santiago's number. You gave them this number? [answering machine:] hello? Hello? Mrs. Emerson, I'm confused... That was the Emerson's answering machine. Why didn't they answer? We know they're home. Something smells fishy around here, cal. Mighty fishy! Not me. Brian? Brian! Nope. He's not there. You've been in here all night. No. I was in the garage putting together the wagon. You remember last Christmas When he woke up in the night And came and opened all our gifts? -Maybe he's done that again... -He's out in the back yard? I've looked. I've looked outside. I've looked everywhere. He's not here. Tom, where is he then? Look, I'm gonna have a look around the neighborhood And see if I can find him. -Maybe he's over at one of the neighbors-- The Sherman’s, with their pile of gifts, Opening up one of them? You think so? That's just not right. I'll have a look around the neighborhood. I'm sure he's just fine. Just call me if he shows up, all right? Okay. Don't worry. Wait a minute. My keys. My keys are gone. What keys? The keys to the station. You think Brian took them? I'm sure that I put them right... Santa Claus! You're saying Santa Claus took your keys? -No, Brian. I bet... I'm going down to the station. He's probably there. Don't worry. Santa Claus? Don't worry, I'll call you. Oh, Brian. He's got the whole bunch of 'em tied up in there. The chief's son, too. Those cops haven't left yet. You got a back door? Yeah. It's in the kitchen. Maybe we should call him. [together:] I think this is an absolute emergency. [meow] One down, eight to go pussy cat. Santa, can't you just sprinkle some magic dust or something, And get us out? I wish it was that easy, Judy. Mike said you were make-believe, But I told him he was wrong. Make-believe!
