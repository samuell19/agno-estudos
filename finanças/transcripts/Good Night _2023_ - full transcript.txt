What took you so long? Hey, I was in the bathroom. - Where's the bucket? - I did not bring it. Why didn't you bring it? Students will make fun of me if they see me carrying a bucket. Yeah, right, as if the students are paying for your expenses. It is a new bucket. His snoring will travel seven seas. Mohan, it's 07:30 a.m. Come on, wake up. Wake up and shut down your snoring! How often should I tell you not to tangle and throw away your undies? - Buffalo! - Mom! Don't you get it at once? Wake up. Don't go back to sleep. - I said, wake up! - Make me some tea. - Hey, Maha! - Yeah, I'm coming. Mom, I told everyone that I completed Engineering. You, too, maintain the same. Don't tell anyone about the arrears. Specifically to Managalam sister. If she knew, then the entire colony would know. Mom, I'm speaking to you. Understood? I won't say anything. Go and take a shower. - Hey, when did you arrive? - Just now! Maha, did your husband wake up? Yeah, he is up! Ask him for coffee or tea. Sure, I'll ask him. Hey, Ramesh! - Then... - Do you want coffee or tea? Coffee... Coffee... Mom, he wants coffee! What model did you install? - Speak with respect to your husband. - I installed supreme pro max. - It's embarrassing! - What filter did you install? Install 80 GPT. Okay, get it ready. I'll be there soon. Thiruvanmiyur is not far. I'll be there. Ma, I have a service call at 10:00 p.m. Please make breakfast. I'm almost done! Hey! Hey! Why are you sleeping over here? Listen, I need to buy materials. Let me borrow your card. I will pay you back next month. It's in my wallet. Take it. I have a service call at 10:00 a.m. Shall I go first and take a shower? - Maha's mom! - I will go first. - I need to be there at 10:00 a.m. - Here I come! Will you be done in ten minutes? How can I take a shower within ten minutes? - What is it, Mangalam? - I ran out of gas cylinders. Can you please make extra curry for lunch? - I will take it from your later. - Sure! Raghavi, did you finish college? Yeah, I finished college. I heard that you flunked in exams. Your mother told me. Maha's mom, I'll come over at noon and make curry. Raghavi, study well! - What gravy are you making? - Radish-lentil curry! Mom, don't you know to make anything else? Why? What's wrong with it? Mom, it stinks when I open my lunchbox. The entire canteen gets the stink. Okay, I won't make it again. Adjust for today. No need. I will have lunch at the canteen. Hey, I already made it. Take it with you. Early in the morning! May I come in? You spoiled the moment. Come in! Did I spoil it? I ran out of deodorant. That's why I came to borrow it. You guys are living your life. You, too, get married and have fun. No one's stopping you! Dude, don't pretend! Are you hiding something? He is pulling my leg. There's nothing to hide. Am I pulling your leg? Shall I tell her? You won't tell your sister, is it? I just started to speak to her. It's not concrete yet. I'll tell you when it is. - Have fun! - You, too, have fun. Sure we will! Anu, are you leaving to work? - Did you eat? - No, I did not. Wait a minute. [sings a Tamil song] Anu, the lunchbox is shut tight. Open it carefully. Okay, bye! Where's the sandwich I made? Anu did not eat, so I gave it to her. Now what do I eat? Didn't you see I made Pongal? Only after I saw it, I made a sandwich for myself. God help me! Hey, give me two candies. Did you see it? I saw it when you sneaked it in at the shop. - Please, I bought it for me! - Hey, give it to me. Hey, your crush is here. Your crush... Shalu? Here? She gets on at Thiruvanmiyur. Hey, I swear she's on the bus. Preethi, stop kidding. Where's she? Turn to your left. She's sitting next to your seat. Next seat... - Hi! - Hi! Oh, my God! How did she? What do I do now? How would I know? It's your headache. - Give me the candies. - Hey! Shalini... This candy matches your dress. Please take it. That was nice! Today is really a big day for all of us. The Indian branch audit we did impress our client very much. So they assigned our team their Dubai office audit too. - That's great! - Yeah! It's great news, and we should celebrate this. So we have arranged a team lunch at Residency Towers. Make sure everyone comes to the lunch. No excuse for anyone. Okay! See you all there. Thank you. There's no need to adjust and continue to work. Stay if you can do your job rightly. If not, resign and leave! Enlighten me, which college are you from? You're sending an email to the client saying, "Please adjust me tonight." Do you even know the meaning of it? Idiot! The office mates have given you an apt name. "Motor Mohan." If you again send emails in improper English to the client, I will definitely kick your bottom! Now get lost! I know it for sure, Preethi. He's holding a grudge against me. That's why I asked you not to complain. How would I know he would read the complaint? Hey, Mr. Motor! Our company's Anti-Harassment board head is Hayagrivan Balaji. - Are you serious? - Yes! And you filed a complaint against him! I'm proud of my child! Do you think this issue is only in this place? It's a universal problem. There's no other option. We have to bear it and continue working I don't understand. Why do you have to bear it? The company pays you a salary and you work for it. I'm so angry that I want to beat him up. Please don't create a stir and turn it into a mess. Calm down! - Dude, Shalini is here. - Not just you. Hey-- Watch out! Why do you do this? You can't sit for five minutes without bumping into something. And you talk about beating him up. Don't you have any sense? Anu, come with me on the bike. I'll drop you off after lunch. Okay! Sister, I don't want to come. What is your problem? It's just a simple lunch. That's it! It won't suit me. Please understand. We have been colleagues for five years. Why is it a trouble for you to come with us? Suit yourself! Grandpa! How come you're back early? - The office ended early. - Oh, I see. - How was the sandwich? - It was good. Sit down. Let's have some tea. Make tea for Anu too! That's him. One minute, Mohan. My mother-in-law has come down from native. Last night your snoring was heard in my house. My mother-in-law could not sleep. She wanted to know who it was. - He's the guy. - Greetings, son. Mohan, having milk with pepper will help you snore less. I saw it on YouTube. Here you go! - Hey, what's wrong with him? - Has he gone mad? Hey, what are you doing in the dark? Hey, Mohan! Why are you crying? What happened? Hey, Ramesh, come over here. - What happened? - What happened? - Why did you pour hot milk on me? - Mom, come over here. Hey, why are you crying? - Why are you shouting? - Look, he's crying. Mohan, why are you crying? - What happened? - He's not telling me what happened. Is there an issue at the office? Did the pepper in the milk get you? He never drank the milk. We are talking to you. Speak up! Tell me what happened. And why are you crying? Shalini in my office... traveled in the same cab as me. Hey! That's awesome! Why are you crying? Congratulations! He's a bloody bad omen! - Hey, who is Shalini? - No one. What about her? Nothing about her. Only I am hurt! Okay, okay! - What happened next? - What else do you expect? My snoring shattered my lovely dreams. This did not bother me much. I was not aware that she knew. In the evening, I went to propose. What she asked me at that time... was hurting! I was not able to travel for this one cab ride. Mohan, how do you expect us to travel for life? Sorry, Mohan! Motor damage! It was humiliating! - Oh, damn! - Don't get upset for a silly crush. You'll find someone else. I'm not lucky as you are. You came to fix the water filter and married my sister. - I'm not lucky. - Mom, he's drunk. Really? - Hey, why did you drink? - Mom, don't beat him. How many times should I say not to drink? - Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! - Mom, let go of him. Mom, please calm down! Calm down! So what if she dumped you? There are many fishes in the pond. Just the name Mohan will attract many girls. - How dare you drink? - Mom, don't beat me. Mom, please calm down. Please sit down. - I'll kill you. - Mom, you had a crush on him. Isn't that why you named me Mohan? Like he has a nickname, Mic-Mohan. - The office mates have a nickname for me. - What is it? "Motor Mohan." - Shut up! - Mocking me. You guys mock me at the house. And they mock me at the office. Mangalam auntie from downstairs... Mangalam auntie! She's mocking me too! How dare she mock me? I'll beat her to a pulp! Calm down! Mangalam mocked you. Wait and watch what I do to her. - Don't go! - Beat her! Stop being a prude. She rejected me! This is how your father drank to death. - A little... - I'll handle him. Listen, don't drink, and come home. If you do it again, I'll be pissed. - Shall I tell her? - Come to me, dear! - Shall I tell her? - Don't worry. He's drunk and upset. You guys leave. - I said, go. - Step aside. You both deserve each other. Mohan, you should not give up on such silly things. Bloody, getting me caught. - I'll kill you! - Obviously... You snored, and we have to bear this nonsense. My love palace is shattered! Hey, today is Anu's birthday. Oh, yeah! I did not even wish her.

You finish and come home. We need to talk. Why do you sound low? What happened? - Nothing happened. - Come on, tell me! - Your stepmom came home. - Oh, no! What did she want? Subha got married after us. But she is with a child now. I'm supposed to go alone to a temple in Thiruvidaimaruthur. I'm seriously talking, and your response is just, "Hmm." Hey, she's an old hag. Please don't take her words seriously. Oh, you expect me to take the heat from all your relatives. What do you want me to do now? Do you want me to fight with all of my relatives? Good Lord, I'll shut up and bear it all! Ask your relatives to come home and yell at me. Don't pay heed to their talk. It's a silly matter, and you've been cribbing since morning. Oh, God, no! What happened? Son, what happened to you? - Nothing serious. - You should've been careful. - You're bleeding. - It slipped from my hands. Go and get me the first aid kit. - Come with me. - Don't bother. I'm fine. Come with me. Let me give you first aid. You lost a lot of blood. You should've been careful. I was fighting with my wife over the phone. It slipped from my hands. Sorry ma'am. Men don't know anything but yell. Regardless of the issue, they yell at their wives. Don't get angry! If you choose to get angry for every issue... health and life will get affected. Fights in relationships are normal. Yelling at each other does not solve anything. Instead of holding on to your egos, sit down and talk. Everything will be alright! Only a membrane has to be changed. I'll change it this Sunday. I'll take my leave. Careful. Ride safe. Listen, you dropped the filter. Did it get damaged? It is not damaged. Even if it's damaged, I'll change it free of cost. - I'm leaving. - That's great. Son, these are homegrown mangoes. Please take it. Thank you. I'll take my leave. [sings a Tamil song] Hey, who's sending you so many messages early in the morning? It's from a friends' group. Hey, how do I edit songs to update as status? I don't know. Spending on your education was a waste. I'm done with visiting temples. Stop irritating me. He's an accomplished astrologer. Why can't you go and light a lamp, as he says? - Is it ready? I'm leaving. - Yes, it's done! On Tuesday, take Maha to the temple and light a lamp. - Tuesday? - Yes! Hmm... Okay, Ma! Bring the rice sack when you're returning home. I can't bring it by myself. He's idle. Why don't you ask him to get it? Constantly piling on chores for me. Hey, send me Aadhi's love failure status. Hey, Moha! - Listen! - What is it? - Let's go and get the rice sack. - You get it! - How can I carry it by myself? - So? Sit behind the bike and hold the sack. - I'll buy you shawarma. - Not interested! I meant Hip-Hop Aadhi, not Mirugam Aadhi. Hey, get up at once! What's our problem? Can't you let me be in peace on a Sunday? - Stop disturbing me. - Change your pants. Aadhi status my foot! I'm in a different mood. I have no peace of mind. Hey! Didn't you say we have to bring a rice sack? But why are you carrying this? On the way, I have a minor service call to attend. - Now you're pissing me off! - It'll take just ten minutes. I'll be done in ten minutes. It's right on the way. Is this pickle? The house call we are about to tend... An old couple lives in that house. They became close to me. They gave me homegrown mangoes. So I made pickles out of it. Who are you, man? Wherever you go, install a filter you make a family. Similarly, you impressed my sister too. - If you don't mind, may I say something? - Go ahead! Don't keep repeating it. It really irks me! - Okay! I will try. - I'm going to bash you! Listen, you carry on. I'll wait here. - Come with me. - Why? - You carry on. - It's okay, come with me. - I don't even know them. - We'll be done in five. You're irritating me! Look who's at guard! Hey, hey... okay, stop right there! - Grandpa! - Stay put! - Grandpa! - Come in. - Come in. How are you? - I'm good. - How's your hand? - It's good now. - I'm here to change the membrane. - Sure, son! Give me that. - My wife made it. - That's great. - Sit down. You too. - Sit down, son. Thanks a lot for it. I love mango pickles. Here, keep it inside. - Where are you taking it? - To throw it in the trash. - Give me that plastic cover. - It's oily. I'll wash it. I don't understand her fascination. Our house is filled with plastic covers. Would you like to have some tea? Okay, sure! Is he your assistant? My brother-in-law. My wife's younger brother. Oh, sorry! It's alright. - I'll change the membrane. - Okay! Where do you work? - I work in IT. - Oh! He's the reason Maha, and I are married. My folks did not agree. It's he who convinced everyone. That's good! - Are you married? - Not yet. I'm sure you have a girlfriend at the office. - No, sir. - That's disappointing. - I'll put it away. - It's okay, don't bother. - I said don't bother. - I don't mind. Such a good boy. That too in these times. - Ramesh! - Oh, no, what happened? - What happened, son? - Ramesh, get here soon. - Son! - I knew this would happen. Ramesh! Ramesh! Ramesh! - Hey, what did you do? - The pipe broke! - Come on, help me. - Get out. - Hold it. - Go upstairs. - Go upstairs and close the valve. - Sorry! - The tank is on the terrace. - Okay, Grandma. Hurry up! Close the valve! - I'm getting to it. - You guys keep breaking things. Sorry, Grandpa! Hello! Hey, how long it's going to take? You spoiled my Sunday. Moron, close the valve! Hey, sorry, sorry! I should've brought the rice sack myself. I regret bringing you with me. Now open the valve and come downstairs. I'm coming down. [sings a song] Oh, God, no! Thank goodness it did not tear. The stitching is worn a bit. - It can be fixed-- - Excuse me! I need to go upstairs. - Do you live here? - Hmm. I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Is it torn? Why is she staring? Bye! Not much, though. - I apologized to your daughter. - He did not do it on purpose. - What did you break over there? - How much is it? - It's 2,300 rupees. - Okay. - How did the tea get spilled? - I spat in shock. Oh, no. Ask them for cloth. We'll clean it up! You better leave. - Okay, you clean it up. - You wait outside. Hey! Hey! Oh, no! Sorry, I don't know where the dog came from. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Don't bother. Here's your lunchbox. I'm sorry. The dog was biting my slippers. - That's why... Here look at this. - It's okay. Don't worry. It's a new pair. - It was biting it. - I said, it's okay. I'm sorry. I bought it last week from Anand Footwear. - It's okay. Don't bother. - What happened? You see... I threw my slipper at her. - Why would you do that? - What happened, dear? It's a new pair. And the dog was biting on it. So I threw it. Sorry, Grandpa. I did not do it on purpose. It's a new pair from Anand Footwear... - I did not do it on purpose. - I'm sorry too. - For God's sake, leave. - Apologize to her. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm leaving. Bye! They're good clients. Get lost! Don't push me. - Get on the bike. - Hold on! The stitches are worn out. I'm pissed. It'll be better if you hurry up. Hold on. The stitches on the pants are worn out. - Hey, what is it? - Please come to this side. - Turn around. - Hop on, dude. I said turn it around. Why did I bring you to torture myself? Get on the bike! Come on, ride fast! Bloody buffalo! Don't shake, damn it! - Listen... - Hmm! Would Karthi's profile suit Anu? He can't even smile for a picture. Grumpy face! - What about Suresh? - He's 48 years old. Are you looking for a match for Anu or you? - Listen... - Hmm! In the morning, the boy who came with the water filter service man... What is his name? Do you mean the moron who broke the pipe? His name is... Mohan. We must find a good match like Mohan for Anu. No, no, no... Not him. He broke the pipe! He threw a slipper at her. The bloody monkey he is. What makes you say that they won't be a match? I can't get rid of my paunch in a day. So is your logic. I have a feeling they might be a match. Don't talk nonsense! Don't spoil Anu's life. Shut up and sleep! - Sure. - Thanks. - Mohan. - Yeah... On the invite, should I mention just Mohan or... - You see... - You can mention Motor Mohan. Can't you keep your mouth shut? You can mention Mohan. My engagement is on the 31st. Please do come. I will. Congrats! Mohan... sorry! - I did not intend to hurt you. - It's okay. It's okay. No problem. Congratulations! I'll be there. Let it go. Don't get upset. - Hello. - Tell me! - Where are you? - I'm on a service call. Come to the bar. In the evening, my folks are coming home. Don't come home drunk. Shut up and get home. Mohan, you've started to drink a lot. This is not good. - Okay, hang up. - Don't come home drunk. Don't mistake me. I'm not here to slide. Please wait. One minute. I was not there to slide on the wall. I came to see you. Why are you standing over here? Since morning the puppy was puking. - So I... - Let it go. No, I need to take it to the vet. Why are you standing here? I came by auto. He let me out because the puppy puked. - Book another auto. - My phone ran out of battery. Okay, let's see if we can find another auto. - Where to? - To Ashok Nagar. Where in Ashok Nagar? - Do you know the route? - I need to check the map. My phone is switched off. Boss, get inside. You're holding the traffic. Please move. It's puking again. - It's puking! - Hold on! One minute. - Hurry up! - One minute. - Oh, no! - Here's your RC book. Why did you take the cover of my RC book? - It's a new cover. - I'll buy you another one. What the hell are you doing with the dog's puke? Don't you spill it inside the auto? - I won't. - There, there, puppy. Oh, God! - I'm sorry. - Don't mind! - Please ride faster. - What? We'll reach in five minutes. Nothing to worry about. - Just a digestion problem. - Oh! I've put it on IV. It should be fine in an hour. - Get these tablets. - Okay, doctor. - Doctor, it bites on new slippers. - What? Slippers... Give it a couple of more injections. So that it does not bite. It's okay. I'll handle it. - Listen... - Hmm. Shall we have tea? Anyway, the doctor said it'll take an hour. I don't want tea. - Aren't you hungry? - No, I'm not. But I'm hungry! - What shall I get you? - I don't want anything. - Why? - I am good! - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Brother! - Sir? - Do you have chicken puff? - Yes, we do. Get me one chicken puff. I'm sorry. On that day I was trying to hit the puppy. I never expected it to get you. - It's okay. No worries. - I'm very sorry. The wall... There used to be a similar wall at my school. I got reminded of it and got excited. Please don't take me for someone who slides on every wall I see. No. I did not. Sure! - Anything else? - Thank you. - Later. - Okay, sir. Where do you work? I work as an Audit Assistant at a private auditing firm. And you? - IT! - Oh... Shall I order a bun butter jam for myself? Shall I? Get me a bun butter jam. Are they your grandparents? No, they're my landlords. Oh... Do you live with your parents? - I live alone. - Oh, okay. Are your parents back in native? No! When I was in 3rd grade I lost my father. And six years ago, my mother passed away. Okay, let's go. I'm sorry I kept you from work. - I disturbed you. - Anyway, I was heading to a bar. I was done with work... I was heading home after work. - Thanks a lot. - Bye! - Anu... - Yeah! Don't let the puppy sleep on the floor. The doctor advised me to put it on a sack or mat. - Okay! - Bye! He also asked not to feed it today... I told you. But you never listened. Reduce your paunch! One minute! If you ever feel lonely... please come home! I did not mean it that way... There's mom, sister, and younger sister at home. It'll be fun. We can play board games. - Okay, sure. - That's what I meant. Bye. - Bye! - Bye! Ramesh, how come you're early today? Why aren't you listening to any music? [sings a Tamil song] Sis, my head is itching. Please give me an oil massage. To hell with it. I won't do it. What happened? What happened? Hey, Raghavi... Hey! Mom... Mom, what happened? Why do you have a long face? Maha's mother-in-law was here in the afternoon. Wretched woman. She was spewing poison. What did she say? "It's been five years, and Maha is not pregnant." "Many rituals and treatments are done." "But of no use!" "I should get him divorced and remarried." What did Ramesh say? He did not say anything. As usual, he kept his head down. He's useless! This is why I wanted to perform a ritual-- Mom, shut up! I always get shut up. Enough with the superstitions. The root cause of all problems. If I hear the TV sound I don't know what I'll break. Okay, okay! I'm switching it off. Sister... - Can you make biriyani? - You want food? Don't you dare come to me for food? I'll smack anyone who does. You don't have a problem eating. But when I need your support, you stay silent. Why the hell should I cook? I don't care if you guys eat or die. Right! This isn't going to work. What are you doing, Mohan? I'm going to make my favorite, Upma! Why do you do this? Sister does not like Upma, right? Hey, quit it! Hey, what are you doing? Sooji Upma. Mohan, I'm damn pissed! For God's sake, switch off the stove. I'm famished. Will you cook biriyani? - No way in hell. Switch off the stove. - Are you going to or not? I can't switch it off. Please, biriyani. At least, upma. Go and get chicken. Hey, go and get chicken! Thank you.

If you're not able to tell the world who you are... they pick a name for you. The name that was given to me at a tender age is... the kid who killed her father. In the beginning, I did not believe it. But the incidents followed, beginning with my favorite Math teacher's heart attack. Then it was the landlord's son, Siva, train accident. Finally, my mother. It's not fate that I have to live alone. It's a decision I made. I get it. I was afraid it was something serious. You say that you're unlucky. Do you think I will suffer if I'm with you? At the office, a girl rejected my proposal. I was roaming in depression! Since I met you until this second, I've been happy. Not just me. Since the day I met you, even my family has been happy. You're a lucky girl. Don't mind me for being straightforward. I like you very much! I'll be happy if I can spend my life with you. That's my opinion. - You don't seem to understand. - Listen...

You used to make snide remarks at me, right? Hypocrite! I'm a hypocrite! Ramesh, I have no one but you. Please help me. I'll speak. You stay put. - Ma... - Here, hold this! There's a girl named Anu at one of my client's house. Shall we check if she would be a match for Mohan? Mohan likes the girl. - What is he saying? - It's not imperative, Mom. If you don't like it, we can drop it. Then let's drop it. We'll pursue the proposal from Rajamani. Sure, let's go ahead. - What the hell? - Let me do my work. - Who is it? - That girl! She's a good girl. I have seen her. - Didn't you say she works somewhere? - Yeah, she works as an accountant. She's a good girl. And she makes good money. She's a very calm girl. She's a good girl. Ma, let's meet the family next week. Let us meet them. Mohan likes her. She did tell me earlier. That Anu and Mohan will be a match. But I did not believe it. - Can you please shut up? - But everything fell in place. I'm happy! Come dear. - Mom... - Hey, don't look desperate. We met many suitors but she did not like anyone. However, she likes your brother-in-law. Sit down, dear. - Say Hi. - Hi! Hi! We will take our leave. Sir, we'll get back home, discuss it with the family and give you a reply. - Mom, what do you want to discuss? - Keep quiet! Sure, sounds good. Anu, you go back upstairs. Okay. I'll take my leave. It's raining. Why don't you walk her upstairs? - Sure, okay! - Why should he? Let him go, Mom. Hey, go ahead! - Go ahead. - I'll go and drop her off. - Why did you bring it up? - Let's go! Are you okay with it? My folks will agree too. Okay. Okay. Bye! - Bye. - Bye, bye! Hey, what is this? Hearts! Do you call this a heart? It looks like an Indian commode. As if your brother won't like it. - Don't criticize. Get lost. - Enough! You leave. - I said, leave. - Here you go. Have fun. Mr. Groom! As your brother-in-law, I've performed my duties. Hereafter, it's your responsibility. Ramesh, I'm afraid! Why? What happened? I did not mention my snoring yet. I tried to tell her a lot of times. Idiot, stop repeating the same nonsense. Don't mess it up. She might runaway after the wedding night. - Moron-- - Hey... - ...shall we leave? - Sure. Take care. Don't fret. Everything will be fine. - Let's go. - Mohan, bye. Call me later. Okay. Please sit down. I never expected everything will come together so soon. About this... Next month when we go to Kodai... We have time! Do you like the house? Actually, this house is very calm. Back at my place, throughout the night, there's a train sound. Due to the noise, I don't get proper sleep. I wake up startled. But here it's very calm. Yes, it is! Shall we go out this weekend? Let's go to a movie. Then have dinner at the mall. - Movie? - Why not? No problem. Let's go! Tell me. I'm not fond of theatres much. Why? I find the loud sound jarring. I get a headache. I don't go much to the theatres. - It's okay. - Let's not go. - You book tickets. We'll go. - It's okay. We'll watch it when it's on OTT. - I listen to Korean songs. - Korean songs? - Do you know the lyrics? - I'm not good at it. But I can manage. I cook well don't worry. Proposal... In college, a boy proposed to me. I did not know how to react at that time. I started crying. Fine, tell me why you like me? First time when I saw you sliding on the wall... I thought, "Who the hell is this guy?" But after the veterinary hospital... I slowly started to like you. When did you start liking me? I was looking for you. - I was... - What happened? Sit down! - Sit down. - What happened? Last night I snored in my sleep. Did I disturb you? - No! - Please don't lie. I'm not lying. - No? - No, you did not disturb me. - Promise? - I swear. It did not disturb me. Okay. You carry on! Oh, God, no! Thank God! Ramesh, imagine if all your problems get resolved in one day. I'm feeling the same. That means you're enjoying your life. That's right. What happened last night? You don't even ask. I was afraid she'd leave me because of my snoring. And she was afraid I might make a move. Both were afraid and kept talking until dawn. Later we both went to sleep. They were only talking all night. - Get lost. - What are you saying? Liquor-- If she gives me permission to have liquor... I'll be the luckiest person. I never expected married life to be so much fun. You never told me. Come in! - How are you, sister-in-law? - I'm good! Mom! Mom! Look who's here. - Did you clear your arrears? - Don't bring it up. Mohan, that's a pleasant surprise. - She wanted to meet you guys. - Hey, Anu! - Hey, Anu, welcome. - Please sit down. Please sit down. Mr. Groom, your face is all smiles. Let's go! - How are you, dear? - I'm good, sister! Why is she not wearing a dupatta? Mom, that's a kurti. No one wears a dupatta for that kind of Kurti. I don't understand modern fashion. - Welcome Mangalam. - Maha's mom. We came to meet Mohan's wife. Please come in. So, tell me, dear. How's it going? Do you go to work? Yes, I go to work. It takes a toll on us to do household work. How do you manage office and household work? Do you have any relatives? No! My parents had a love marriage. So we lost touch with our relatives. Oh, so your parents had a love marriage too. Hey, do you have any sense? We got you a house afar for you to live in peace. Why did you bring her here? I came to meet you, people. As if you never met us. You should've taken her out. I wanted to. But it was already late. Idiot, it's okay if you don't take her out. Instead, cook a good meal for her. - What does she like? - I don't know what she likes. I can't take this anymore. Mr. Groom, when I went to her place for service... I've noticed her eating fried rice. I believe she likes fried rice. Why don't you make her fried rice? Are you sure? I'm sure! You impress her with fried rice. I found out egg fried rice is your favorite. And made it for you. That is Mohan. Now tell me, what's my favorite dish? I don't know. Let me tell you. I love Upma the most. I'm serious; I love Upma! Whenever I am sad... If I make Upma and eat, I'll be happy. How is it? There! There! There, there. You'll be fine. There, there. Relax! You guys are killing me. She does not like fried rice. What are you saying? I have seen her eat fried rice. Look, if you know, then say it. - Don't speak for the sake of it. - Okay, dude! Have this. You'll be fine. You could've said you did not like it. You made it with love... How can you sleep on an empty stomach? Shall I make you something? Okay, okay, I won't cook.

What happened, doctor? Nothing to worry about. Does she work night shifts? No, she does not. Why do you ask? Sleep deprivation. It's been two weeks since she had a proper sleep. I've given her sleeping pills. She'll be fine if she sleeps well. Find out the reason why she did not get sleep and sort it out. Sleep is very important. Okay, doctor. Did you fight with her? Is there a problem at the office? Did you force yourself on her? I'm sorry, son! I'm the problem, Grandpa. I snore aloud! She hid it from me. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Don't get upset. After a long time in my life, I was very happy. She does not speak a lot. But when she's with me, I feel so happy. I'm not lying. I don't understand how I got this snoring. I never thought I would face such a big issue in life. Mohan, everything will be fine. Don't be upset. You have no idea. It's been three years... This May, it'll be three years since the office trip. The Munnar trip. My colleague Rahul... was my roommate. I think he suffered a lot in the night because of my snoring. The next day on the bus... ...he mocked me to bits. Imagine how I must've felt. For the next five days, I was the topic during drinking sessions. Me and my snoring! I was waiting for the trip to end. When you go to sleep, you sleep peacefully. But it's not the case with me. I'll always be on alert... ...thinking they'll make fun of my snoring. I always sleep in fear. When you're awake, you're in the senses. And when told I could rectify my problem. It can be rectified. What do I do? What do I do? I'm afraid, Ramesh! Don't cry. Everything will be fine. Hey! Why did you go and sleep in the next room? - Hello! - Anu... I hope you're doing well. I'm doing well. Okay, I'm hanging up. It's okay. You can smoke. I was a bit tired yesterday. There's nothing else to it. You don't know to lie. So, stop trying. We both know what's the truth. It's tough to make some decisions in life. But it has to be done. Only then will our future be good. What decision are you going to make? I don't want to make you suffer by sleeping next to you. - Until I get the snoring under control... - What... what are you saying? - You be in the other room. - Oh, God! - You don't have to do it. - Please listen to me, Anu. - Please hear me out. - I said, go! Why did you agree to sleep in the next room? What do you expect me to do? She has not slept for fifteen days. Do you expect me to disregard her health and sleep next to her? Ramesh... he's sleeping in the next room so that she does not suffer... I couldn't help but cry. I'm proud of you, Mohan. I'm saying you're only to have three rounds of drinks. If you get drunk and sulk all night... - you will have to sleep outside. - No, no, just three rounds. You go, babe! Tell me, dear. I'll be home in an hour. Okay, I'm hanging up. Bye, bye! Everyone except me is happy in this world. I don't know when my snoring will stop and when I will have a life. I'm fed up! My world is upside down here. And you're drinking as if there's no tomorrow. - What did I do? - Do something! When you install a water filter and married my sister... my family was against it. If not for me, you would've been in a mess. - Ramesh, this is not right. - He's torturing me! - When you're in trouble in the future? - Enough, stop it! You want a solution. Come with me. I'm ending your troubles tonight. Will this work? Tread with courage! Anu... Take it out. Wear it in your ears. - Can you hear me? - What did you say? Can't you hear me? Wear it again. Uh... can you hear me? - I can't hear you at all. - Really? You can't hear me at all. [sings in joy] Hello! Come outside. Outside! Go! Go to that room. Go! Hey, you close the laptop! I must go through so much trouble sleeping next to my wife. Anu... did you miss me a lot? Anu... Hey... Hey! Hey, remove it! - Sorry, were you speaking to yourself? - Wear it only when you're going to sleep. What else to do? You don't seem to care. I missed you a lot. For the past few days, I have been messed up. I was in limbo. It's not like I was at peace. I agree that I should not have hidden it from you. You can punish me as you please. But don't sleep in the next room. I beg you. Please sleep next to me. Forget it. Now our problems are resolved. Ramesh is a genius! Anu... Even the biggest problems in life have only small solutions. It's us... - ...com-- - Complicate! ...who complicates it. Listen... today it won't be possible. Oh... okay. Okay, okay! No problem. It's getting late. We have work in the morning. Wear the plugs and go to sleep. We can cuddle, though! I love you, Anu. Anu... - Anu! - I'm over here! - Would it take time? - Here I come! How about last night? Did you sleep well? Yeah, I slept well. Please don't lie, for my sake. When I find out, it's a lie. It'll hurt me. You tell me the truth! Did you not sleep? Was I too loud? What is it? I need to stop snoring!

Why do you have a long face? Nothing! Hey, come on, tell me. What happened? All these years, they spoke ill of me... But now I'm getting so much love and affection. I don't know how to take it. I feel weird. If I'm pregnant, I get all the love and attention I want. If I don't, then no one would care less. Have you gone mad? All our problems are resolved. See, you're validating my point. There were problems because I was not pregnant. Now that I'm pregnant, our problems disappeared. Where am I in all of it? I fear that you might become one of them. How could you accuse me of it? Do you think I'm cruel? Hey, do you think I'm cruel? Not happening! Now that you've accused me... I don't feel like talking to you. I won't talk to you! Hey, why are you creating a scene now? If not me, who would you speak to? I will speak to my child. I will tell my child to slap you. - Yeah, right! - Why are you getting angry for no reason? Token No: 7, Mohan! Don't be afraid. It is a general sleep test. Just relax! Sleep peacefully. I'll wait outside. AHI 7 It's mild Sleep Apnea. When will it get cured? A few have been cured. A few were not cured. For a few, the intensity has come down. Let's see. During the next sitting, we'll conduct Sleep Endoscopy... and conclude. Don't worry. Okay. - Okay, doctor. - Okay, doctor. There's tea in the kitchen for you. I'll have it later. How come you're up so early? Tell me! Last night the doctor said that it may not get cured for life. I was thinking about it all night. Listen, they're rare cases. What if I'm one of the rare cases? Don't confuse yourself. It'll cure eventually. Suppose the snoring did not stop at all... What do we do? - Listen... - Anu, if this life does not suit you... if you don't like it... ...you can leave anytime. I won't stop you! It's hot. The tea is spilling! Idiot, you spilled the tea. Don't you ever repeat it! Fine, I was just pulling your leg. Why are you crying? Hey! How long are you going to address me formally? Do you know how my sister addresses my brother-in-law? She's very casual with him. I don't understand why you don't do it. You're useless. Okay, Mohan, get ready for work! Hey, hold on! There goes everything! You did not let me have coffee. Forget it. I'll make another one for you. I don't need it! Go! Drink this! Raghavi put these fritters on the leaf. Mom, can't you see I'm talking? Hey, I said, take it away. - Anu... - Tell me, mother-in-law. - So, what's happening, dear? - What happened? There's no glow on your face. All okay? We came by bus. Too much dust. Is there something special? No. Mohan said it was a death anniversary. Okay. Get back to Raghavi. - Do you need any help? - No need. I'll do it. Okay. Hey, no need for it. We'll rent a banquet hall for the baby shower. No need for a primary function. Mom, it's a small banquet hall. It can only hold 100 people. Why do we have to do it? - Let it keep low key. - Why should we not? We are doing it to prove a point to your relatives. Your stepmom should come! I want to see her jaw drop with surprise. Hey, we'll have it on the terrace. First, finish your meals. Ask her if she wants anything. Anu? - Here, have some snake gourd. - That's enough. - Do you like it? - Yes, I like it... It doesn't sound like you do. Snake gourd is undone! Why did you criticize her? Didn't you ask me to speak my heart? That's only applicable to me not my mother. - How would I know? - You're incorrigible. Bring me phenol. Hey, you, is that your stomach or water tank? Pees all the time. Don't act cute. I'll break your legs. - You peed on the bean bag too. - What did you cook? I made mushroom briyani. Pour it! Hey! This is how you pour. You asked me to pour and I did. You and your poker face. You both are torturing me. Hey! Hey! - I'm going to whack it. - Hey, it's a poor thing. - Let it down. - Please don't do it. - If you don't, then you'll get it. - Please spare it. Please don't harm the baby. Oh, no! What happened? What happened? - Oh, God! - What happened? I knew you'd bump into and get hurt. I did warn you. - Shall I get you ointment? - No need. I'm going to my room. - Don't be stubborn. - Don't push me! - I'm going to my room. - It'll hurt if you strain yourself. Sleep here tonight. I took an oath. I won't sleep here. Oh, God! Tomorrow is Sunday. - The oath can take off. Sleep here. - No need, Anu. I said, sleep here! Mohan... Do you sleep peacefully when you're in the next room? I'm not able to take it. Your mom was expecting to hear that I'm pregnant. To me, it's not important. I want to be with you. I'm not too fond of it either to sleep in the next room. I want you to sleep peacefully. Good Lord! I don't want a peaceful sleep. I feel at peace when I'm with you. I don't know whether you get me or not. Okay, okay. Don't cry. Okay, don't cry. Promise me you won't sleep in the next room. I won't! I promise I won't! I won't. I'll sleep next to you. Sorry, Anu. I won't go. Don't cry. I won't go. I won't go! What happened? - Sorr-- Sorry, Anu. - What happened? - I was snoring aloud. - No! - I know I was too loud. - No, you were not. - I could hear myself. - What happened? Why are you awake? - I was asleep. - Was I too loud? - No! - Was I too loud? - I was asleep. - My snoring woke you up. I woke up because you woke up. - I'm sorry, Anu. - You please go back to sleep. - Please hear me out. - You can't sleep peacefully. - Anu... let go of me. - Please sleep here. - I better go to the next room. - Please sleep here. Listen to me. One minute. I swear you did not disturb me. Anu, we'll discuss it in the morning. Please hear me out for a minute. At least you sleep in peace. Please understand. It's not a disturbance to me. Please come back to bed. Hey, it's disturbing for me! Hey, Preethi, what is your rating? I got an 8% hike. - 8%? - You? Bloody Snob gave me only a 7% hike. - Did you get the email? - Hey, Divya! - I got the email. - What's your rating? - I got a 9% hike. - 9%? - Hey, Motor, what about you? - I did not get an email. Based on your performance... is the output! Sir, I've made maximum story points. There are no defects in my queue. And I have been diligent with my SLAs. I have performed well. Mohan... I showed your old English emails to the new recruits. Everyone laughed through their... Sir, please don't bring English into it. I'm making improvements. What improvement? Check my recent emails. You won't find any errors. - Really? - Sir, please speak on point. - Don't hold a grudge and corner me. - What?! Do you think I don't have any other business to do? You're not a big shot to corner. You can't be true to your work. But get angry! The company should give you a hike. You should not beg for it! I'm being civil because it's an office space. Get out! Idiot... Shall I get you one more? - I'm done. - Okay, eat. Mohan! Listen! Mohan! Don't get startled. Raghavi's friends are coming home. Please sleep inside the room. Mohan! Hey, he's not waking up. Let him sleep over here. - Shall I tell them about your boyfriend? - Shut up! Is the wedding in Chennai? No, it's happening in Trichy. Brother is tired from the night shift. - So taking a nap. - Not an issue. Are you happy now? - It's all because of him. - What's wrong with you? - Wake up! Wake up! - Hey! - What is it? - Why are you sleeping over here? - What's wrong if I sleep here? - You know that you snore! You should've slept inside the room. Or should've gone to your house. - Why did you sleep here? - What's wrong with you? Her friends came home. They laughed because you were snoring. So she's creating a scene. As if no one in their family snores. - Mom, shut up! - Mom... - You're going overboard. - Why are you yelling? Do you even know how humiliating was it? - It was embarrassing. - Hey, Mohan! I'll slap you! You're incapable of clearing your backlogs. You don't find that humiliating but my snoring. I agree I did not graduate in Engineering. I'm useless! What's your problem? - Raghavi! - Mom, wait. Obviously, you'll talk. It's me who's paying your fees. Your low grades did not fetch a seat in any college. I've taken many loans to pay your fees. If I had known you'd behave like this, I would've not pursued education. I should've not supported you. It's a waste of money. Keep talking over the phone. You'll prosper in your life. Don't you talk about my life. Your snoring will ruin your life. You're going overboard! How dare you? Don't you have any respect for your brother? You're speaking out of your turn. He was right about everything! As if you cleared all your semesters! It's silly, and you're blowing it out of proportion. I'll break your teeth! Hey, Mohan! Mohan! Where are you going? Mohan! Last month's transaction does not tally. Anu! Hold on a minute. Can you step out? I need to talk. - Give me five minutes. - Sure, finish your work. Hello! Ah... sure, sir! Sure, sir! I checked relevant accounting. Okay, I will send it by tonight. Yes, sir. We completed regulated complaints. Sure, sir. I'm sending it right away. Hello, sister! Audit qualification is not required for that report. Sorry, last night I was slammed with work. I went to bed only at 04:30 a.m. Hold this! I'm running late for work. Bye. Listen, tomorrow is the 19th! We have to go to the sleep clinic for the second sitting. Only if we take the follow-up test would we know if there's an improvement. - You better take permission-- - Hey! What the hell is everyone's problem? So what do I snore? Would you stop living? As if you people have no ailments. Hey, I won't change. I will remain the same. And I will snore aloud! What will you do? I didn't... Close your ears and bear it.

You don't seem to value my feelings! When did I, not value? I sleep in the next room so that you do not suffer. You're holding on to guilt and blaming it on me. That is why you sleep in the next room. Had you valued my feelings, you would've not done it. - Ramesh, where have you reached? - Near Guindy. Will be there in 10. - It's okay.

Come on, let's go. - Hello... - Hello! Mom, where are you? We took a U-turn and headed back home. Please don't go back home. - Please come. We'll have dinner. - Mohan said you have a headache. I don't have a headache. He's a little overprotective. - Shall we come over? - Yes, please. We'll be there in a bit. - Ramesh, take a U-turn! - Hey! - Why did you call her? - I don't have a headache. - Mom, where are you? - We're coming over. Didn't I say not to come over? Go back home. Anu asked me to come. Now I'm saying. Go back home. Fine, we're not coming over. - Hello! - Tell me, Anu. Brother, please come over for dinner. Mohan asked us to go home. - Not an issue-- - I don't know... - ...he's short-tempered. - Don’t you have any sense? What is it? - Didn't I say? - What did I do? Go back home! After this UAT stage... I should not get even one escalation from the client. If, by chance, I get an escalation... Hey, Mohan! Dude, wake up! Sorry, sir. I disturbed your nap time. - Let him sleep. We'll leave. - Sir, sorry! - Let him sleep. - Sorry, sir. Sir... Mohan, sir, I believe you recently got married. If I'm right, you should've been divorced by now. Sir, please don't talk about my personal life. To hell with your personal life. You're dozing off in the conference room. You don't fail to question your hike. Perhaps you got your answer. You will get out only if asked to. Fool! There's a requirement for Audit Assistant at our client's Dubai office. Since you handled their files... they wanted you to be part of the team. The assignment is for 6-8 months. Why don't you take it? The situation is not right at home. I cannot take it up right now. - Okay! - I'm extremely sorry, sir. I'll leave it to you. Tell me, sis. I need to get a scan. They asked me to pre-book. I'm going to use your card. Share the OTP with me. - Sure! - Why do you sound low? Nothing! Hey, you don't sound good. Tell me what happened. Nothing! Hey, Mohan, are you crying? Hey, what happened? Why are you crying? Hey, I'm speaking to you. I'm hurting, sister. I think I got married in haste. Why are you crying? What happened? I did tell you earlier... I'm hurting, and I'm hurting her too. - I feel like dying! - Shut up. I'm going to whack you. - Wait, let me get Ramesh. - Don't get him. - Mom! - Don't call him. Hold on a minute. - Sister, please hear me out. - Ramesh! - Sister, please don't get him. - Don't make me beat you. - Mom! - Sister, don't get him. Maha! - Oh, no! Mom! - Hey, what happened? - Mom, hurry up! - What happened? Hey, Mohan! - Hey, Mohan! - Mohan, Maha is in OT. The doctors are not saying anything at the moment. - We are afraid. - Don't worry. Let's wait. They're not telling us anything. - Can you check with them? - Don't worry. I'm scared. They've taken her inside. We will wait for the doctor. Sister-in-law... - How's sister, Raghavi... - Sister... Don't cry. Nothing will happen to her. Don't cry, Raghavi. Mother-in-law... Please don't cry. Sister will be fine. Please don't cry. Please don't cry. What did the doctor say? How is she? - Doctor... - Mom! As she got fits during pregnancy... her condition is quite critical. The child has no heartbeat. We need to perform a Caesarean right away. We don't have a choice. At least we can save the mother. If you can't save the child, please save the mother. We need to start the procedure right away. Please sign the consent form. Sure! God, why are you testing us? Listen... Mother-in-law... Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Please don't! Only now, our family was back to being happy. I don't know who cast an evil eye on our family. We never caused any harm. Poor Maha has to go through this ordeal. Mom, pace yourself. You might hurt yourself. Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Sir, please sign here. Please let me know when you take her to the OT. Okay! - Son... - They will begin shortly. I can't take it. Moha, I can't take it! We never caused any harm to others! Please don't cry. In the morning, we were discussing names for the baby. When she wakes up, what would I tell her? What would I tell her? We lost it! We lost it! - Oh, no... - Don't cry. Please don't cry. Don't cry! Here, take it. - I'm very sorry. - Why? It's all because of me. If I had not spoken to her over the phone... it would've not happened. Don't blame yourself. - Don't worry about it. - I'm sorry. - Hey, come on... - It's because of me... - I'm sorry. - It was not anyone's fault. We can't do anything about it. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's hurting! I'm trying my best not to hurt you. You, too, have been significantly adjusting. Still, why do we have too many conflicts? I don't understand any of it. I've been thinking about it over and over. I know that I'm cursed! I did warn you in the beginning. Now see, because of me, you're in peril. It's not right of me to stay here anymore. You once mentioned it on the same balcony... that I can leave if I don't like to be here anymore. I'm leaving! ♪ Leave ♪ ♪ It is enough that my dreams have shattered, Leave ♪ ♪ Leave ♪ ♪ Enough of the cracks in our relationship, Leave ♪ ♪ I have cried enough because of you, Leave ♪ ♪ You have struggled enough because of me, Leave ♪ ♪ Leave ♪ - Hello! - Are you happy?

And you want to go to Dubai. What does it mean? We got her married with so much love and she wants to go abroad. Does she expect him to sulk while she's gone? The displacement of stars is the reason for bad luck. - Your family is constantly facing trouble. - Yes, seer! Even my son's married life is in trouble. I suggest you go to Thirupampuram temple with your family - ...and perform a ritual. - That's not going to happen! - Seer, you may leave. - What's wrong with you? I'd say you shut up! - Maha! - Shut up, Mom! Are you kidding? I'm here to do good for your family. It's enough. You both shut up. Our lives will be good. Your wife has no respect for us. Obviously! It's like you people are constantly peeping into our bedroom. She's just slowly recovering. You guys have no sense in bringing strange people to our house. This is our life! It does not matter if we have children or not. It's our problem, not yours. Ramesh, let's go out. - Let's go for a movie. - Sure, let's go! Sorry guys. I'm really sorry for being late. Shall we start the meeting? Yes? Hey, Mohan! What a surprise! I thought you wouldn't come. Guys, before we begin meeting, I have some good news. It's Mr. Mohan's last day in the office. Let's give him a big round of applause. - Sir... - Yes! Are you going to fire me? Yes. It's already done! So, Mr. Hayagrivan Balaji. You have a problem with people who cannot speak English, right? Yes! Do you think you're good at English? - Do you? - Definitely! My dear, Freshers! It took full six years for him to complete a four-year Engineering course. Hey! Seventeen standing arrears. Which includes English too. - Am I correct? - Hey! Don't get angry and quit your job. I'm skilled and can find a job anywhere I want. You can only survive if you leech on to this company. I heard... he showed you my improper English emails and you people had a good laugh. Did he ever read the emails he sent to female colleagues? What's with hissing? You're safe until these women keep their mouths shut. If they speak out... What do you think of me? Bloody idiot! Don't you dare touch me! I'm sparing you because we're in the office. Let go of me. Don't show your face to me outside the office... Let go of me! ...then you'll see the real face of Choolaimedu Mohan. Here's your dog tag. You will step aside when said so? The head office team will receive you. And they will take care of everything. Your flight is tomorrow at 01:30 p.m. All the best! Perform well. Hey, Mohan! Everyone has some weaknesses in life. We can't lead a life cribbing about the weakness. I still remember spraying room spray on your wedding night. Don't expect the fragrance to stay forever. Come on check inside my room. The smell of balm will go straight to your head. They've spoiled her health with different kinds of tablets. Life is unavoidable, even when things don't smell as sweet. It's important to acknowledge our flaws and continue living. People used to eat my brains as we don't have a child. That includes my parents too. But my wife has never complained about it. Tripping on ego, you'll ask Anu to go to Dubai. Your life will be hell for the next six months. You'll be a mess! That's all I have to say. Rest is up to you. Tell me! I'm in love with a guy. His parents came to know about our relationship. When? You see... When we were together... his parents saw us. I don't get it. As he was home alone, he invited me over. I, too, went over to his house. When we were together in private... his folks caught us! - Hey! - I'll whack you! - What the hell have you done? - I'm sorry! - Huh? - I'm sorry! Please hear me out. Go ahead! Is this how you raise a girl? - Sir... - I could've filed a police complaint. Some family you are. - This is not a sign of a good family. - Sir, sir, sir! Enough! What would be your complaint? They're adults and are in love. She did not break into your house. Your son invited her, and she trusted him. Raghavi, don't cry. He's a coward with his head down, hiding behind his father. And you dare to question our family's traits? First, raise your son properly. Later you can file a police complaint. Let's go, Raghavi! - Raghavi... - Sister-in-law... Everyone goes through this phase in life. Don't think about anything and be normal. You will find someone good who'd value your happiness. Like how I got your brother. - Hello? - Hello... Where are you? I'm at our house. - When do you leave for the airport? - I'm about to leave. I will drop you at the airport. Don't bother. I'll go by myself. Please let me drop you. - Tell me. - Where are you? We're on our way to the airport. - Hello! - Grandpa, I'm not going to Dubai. - Are you serious? - Yes, Grandpa! You return to our apartment. Hey, Anu is not going to Dubai. Sure, we'll meet you at the apartment. Driver, please make a U-turn. Brother, please drop us off from where you picked us up. Are you not going? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I could not even bear one night with the thought, you were leaving. I suffered a lot. Thanks a lot, Anu. Tell me. I'm on my way to the airport. - What is it? - Don't come to the airport. You guys go back to our apartment. - What? - She's not going to Dubai. Anu is not going abroad. What? They asked us to go back to the apartment. - Are you serious? - Is she not going? - My prayers were answered. - Take a U-turn from here. Just in a day, all the happiness... came back rushing to me! Phew! Thank you, Anu. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Brother, don't take this right. You, please take the next right. And head straight! And take the last right under the bridge, and we will arrive. Brother, please take a U-turn and go to the airport. - Hey, what happened? - You see... - It won't work out. - What do you mean? After I stepped into your life, it got ruined. - Nothing got ruined. - You lost your job. Maha sister faced a tragedy. No-- I can't take it if another incident occurs. Idiot! Brother, please slow down. Don't confuse yourself and talk nonsense. Did incidents occur or not? Did I say? Did I say you're unlucky? - Yes, you told me! - When? You got drunk and were blabbering. Anu... I'm sorry, Anu. Oh, no! What are you saying? To the airport? Son, please don't mind and take a U-turn. - To the airport? - Mom! Mother-in-law... Brother, please go to the airport. Hey, what now? - Anu is going to Dubai. - Oh, no! What's happening? Don't consider drunk talks. Only when you're drunk, do people speak the truth? Sorry, Anu. Hereafter... It was a mistake. I won't drink anymore. - Please get up. - Promise me you won't go. - Please get up. - I'm sorry. - Please get up. - I'm sorry, Anu. You consider yourself bad luck... and it's the cause of my problems? Only after you came into my life... I mustered courage and confidence in my work. I gave the Manager a runaround with the English, you taught me. You're my lucky charm. I swear! Why don't you get it? Sorry, sorry, sorry, Anu! Bro... Sorry, don't cry. Auto bro, please drop us at the apartment. Stop confusing! Should I come to the airport or the apartment? Fine, hang up! Good! You already turned around. How does it matter if I'm here or in Dubai? - You please hear me out... - As it is, I'm alone. I'd rather go. Okay, I won't sleep in the next room. - I promise. Brother, don't turn around. - Please go to the airport. - Mohan... - Let's go to the temple. I regret to have brought them together. For an hour and a half, we've been circling in the same route. The driver is pissed off! Before I start to swear, decide faster. What do you want now? You want to go to Dubai. You want to leave me. Go! But when you return and arrive at this airport... Ramesh will come to receive you. Mohan is dead... - What? - His tombstone... - Have you gone crazy? - He'll take you to my tombstone. - What nonsense? - Wait and watch it'll happen. I said, keep quiet. Then, please don't go, Anu. I'm sure if you leave, I'll do something stupid. I promise. Anu, please don't go. - Brother, take us to our apartment... - Anu, Anu... Brother, please step out. Please step out. What happened? My head is spinning from U-turns. I might faint. Spare me. I'm leaving. - Your fare! - Be blessed, brother! What happened? I think he's not well. Come on, let's go. Oh, no, what do I do now? On the way we'll find another auto. Not that! It's my manager. Anu, tell him you can't make it. What would he do if I backed out last minute? - Are you going to go? - Let me think. Switch it off, Anu. Switch it off. Yeah right. Switch it off and run away from problems. We can't keep escaping. Let's face it. Shall I speak to him? Okay, fine, you talk to him. Hello... Sorry, sir. I can't go to Dubai. No, sir, I'm extremely sorry. Sir, please hear me out-- Sir, please understand I can't go abroad. Sir, I... am pregnant. I'm at the hospital. Only now it got confirmed. Sorry, sir. Let's go! What happened? It's okay to lie. But it should have some logic to it.
