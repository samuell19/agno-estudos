Hello You once told me that people born in March are often peculiar. "Rockstar dies at the age of 27." In this classroom, where everyone subconsciously believes they'll die young anyway regardless, I will live much longer than anyone else. I have always thought it was the foreboding that this disease would bring, but Perhaps... It's just because I was born in March... Much later than anyone else. Shindo?! Shindo, can you hear me? Juice... What did you say? Are you alright? You should drink more. I'm sorry. I'm alright now. Should I bring you to the infirmary? Don't worry, I'm fine now! Do you feel better? Yes Oh, can I ask you a favor? Would you help me giving Nishimura an aid? He tripped and fell. I was getting called just now. Sorry, I'll leave it to you. Yes We will keep working on Masakazu Nakai's "Extreme Awareness" that we started last week. Page 103, second paragraph. This too, "...the thing we should recall,..." we have reached this part. Do you remember? I really like the third paragraph. Alright, so... Nishimura? Please read. Yes Nothing, without any knowledge of this universe, Human's existence is capable of accomplishing even the smallest things. What humankind has accomplished, These sole achievements could be the greatest of the century. No matter what mistakes has been made during the five past millennials, Comparing these to the stupefying reality of our whole history, It's like falling sick on the final day of a wonderful journey. No matter how much we sniffle for a day, We cannot hang our heads ..over the fact that we are snifflers. The traces of these past victories, Lie in every corner of our modern cities. In every corner of our existences. Thank you. Let's see.. Then, to the last paragraph. Sorry! No, don't worry. I'll do it. "Tatoe". Huh? What a peculiar name. Ah, yeah. What does it mean? I don't know. Didn't you ask about it? I didn't. It's a good name. Is that so? At first, I thought the meaning was literal. That means "example". But when I heard you reading. I thought that maybe it was different. Could it be any different? Yeah, for example... What was it? Ah, it slipped my mind. This is the first time someone thinks that deeply about my name. Thanks for taking the trash out. Thank you too. I'm here! I haven't done any of these! Let's go? Yeah! Ai, you are always in a hurry! At least wake me up! I tried, but you were deep asleep. Did I snore? Yeah! For real?! Just joking. Should I give Tokyo a try? Really? You'll be miserable if you chase him to Tokyo but don't end up dating. But wouldn't it be great if we ended up dating? I don't have a dream to pursue a collage degree, and I'll end up working in a job I hate, that'd be the end of me. Like that'd be different if you come to Tokyo with no dream... Ai, you should come with me. Yo! You're early! Ah, yeah. Yo! Yo! That's for you. Thank you. How nice. Okay, talk to you later. Dumbclass! But I'm not a dumbass! Eww. What? Wasn't that amazing?! Wasn't it?! Hey! Yo. Purikura? Show me! Why? Where were you? Seems like those fellas from West High sneak into our school! For what reason? Those dumbasses! And they asked if we wanted to tag along. For what reason though? Stealing answer sheets, maybe? Let's go Let's not. Better not going, right? We shouldn't. I'm not going. I'd like to go. Seriously? Let's go! Stop it, what if we get caught? I wanna go! Okay, I'll let them know then. - You're sure not going? - Of course! Hello? Let's go! Takeuchi and Kimura. What did you just say? Can't hear it. I'm sure! There is no way that kind of thing exists! I'm scared! I'm looking forward to it. Okay. Let's go Oh my god! Ah, wait, wait! Look at the road! I am! Oh my god! Get this! Nice! Hell yeah! You good? Miss, you good? Miss? My underwear though We can't see them! Yeah! Hey, was it the only window that was open? Yeah, it's the only one. Anyone here? There you are. Forgot something? Did you manage to steal the answer sheet? I didn't, the room is locked. The corridor's door was unlocked, you know? How did you get in here? From that window. After taking my shoes off, I opened it up. Are you crazy? What if you fell? I didn't. I like you. I know the entrance exam's coming up, but be my girlfriend. What made you fall for me? How strong-willed you are. What? I'm not that ego-centric. But you are! You shouldn't say this about a girl. There are people at school who don't like you but, I've always thought you were a nice person. Do I have a bad reputation? They're jealous. Thank you. I have feelings for someone else. Mika? I was so scared! Aw, let's go back home. We still haven't finished talking. Tada, let's go back. Let's. Mika, why did you walk alone when you're afraid of dark? "To Tatoe, hello. How was the university you visited? You took a night bus for this and I was afraid they didn't offer economy class. I know you invited me but... I'm sorry I couldn go with you. Even when I feel fine, my body won't keep up. I should be fine if I take the Shinkansen though. I can't wait to walk with you around the cities of Tokyo. The nights got colder, so please don't get sick. I love how hardworking you are. Miyuki" Good morning Sit! Look! I'll send that to your dad. There's no way he could eat all of it. Do you want a piece? No, thank you. Here. Can you write something? Done. Only that? I don't like how it smells! We have the same nail shape! Look! Yeah. Let's gather! Where is Shindo? I dunno. Where is Shindo? Miyuki quit. Why? I don't know. Apparently she decided to quit. Everyone, come here. She is diabetic, right? Not like that she is overweight or anything... Are you friends with her? Not really. I know right. Thank you. Here. Thanks. Here. That's yours. Thank you. Ah, you got this? Yeah, sort of. Could you explain it to me? When you have time. Yeah, sure. Thank you. I understood 'til that point. Right, then.. You put the value of sin to this formula. Oh, this formula! Up to this point, we need cosine value, but since this has a condition the answer will be 25/7. That's how it was. Yes. That teacher is always making it tricky on the question two from the last, don't they? I thought the same. They have a twisted mind. Yeah. But I have the feeling they actually don't. Did you get it? Yes, thank you. Ai... Do you like someone? What? I don't! Why? Nothing... If you do, tell me! Of course I would! "To Tatoe, hello. A month has passed. How do you feel at school? We're in the same class, though. Since we can't talk to each others at school, I wrote this letter with the pen I got from you. I really like how the ink looks like. I'll come early to put the letter in your locker. I'm really happy you seem to have picked a hobby! I 'll write to you again. Miyuki." Miyuki! Which one is good? What? The one still ongoing Is there any good? Yes. Chainsaw Man is really interesting Especially that demon... Maybe you don't understand. Really... Do you feel any better? Yes, don't worry. You quit the club activities though? Even though I finally could join. Something came in the way.. Don't mind me, just take your insulin shot. You used to do it in front of us, didn't you? It sounds like I'm a suspicious person. Diabetes has nothing to do with eating habits, right? You know about it? Some of my relatives have it too. Hey... How does it feel like? I'd like to try one day. Why? I'm just curious. No? It's not that but.. You're healthy so why... I'm just curious! Does it hurt? It doesn't hurt that much. Did you eat lunch? Yeah. Okay. I'll give you the lowest dose. Is it fine to inject it anywhere? Around the navel. Keep going. Push the button. Just like this. How do you feel? Well... I feel full. What? It's not that kind of medicine! I could press the button without being too scared. It must be like drinking water to you. Yeah, sort of... Tell me your LINE ID! Yes. How does it work? You don't know?! Here. People usually don't buy movie pamphlet! What? Most of the time I always buy them. Not that I often go to the cinema though. Do you read that thing? Once the movie's over. Is it here? You're cute. What... I'm not cute at all. If that's the case you wouldn't've received that offer to be part of the group. No way... You're much cuter. Do you have a boyfriend? You got one, right? Tell me. How about you? I don't. Really? You're super popular so I thought... Enough talking about me. What kind of person are you dating? Someone from school. Really? Who? Tatoe Nishimura. Is there anything wrong? Nishimura? From our class? Yes, I know... Did you find one? Not yet. You're so good at singing. Do you think so? It's the first time i've been to karaoke with someone else other than my family. Seriously? Yeah. I don't really know nowadays songs though. Judy and Mary? I like them! Really?! So... Hey, about Nishimura.. We've been in the same class since our first year. Were you dating back then? You're bringing that back? Of course! We were going to the same cram school. Ever since 9th grade.. Really! It's been a while then! Nobody found out. We're not talking at school so. We don't really hang out either... Why? Tatoe's parents don't really like the idea... Your parents? No, Tatoe's. Why? I see... I bet you do dirty stuff together. We don't! Not even dirty jokes?! I'm sure you do! We don't! Seriously?! It's the truth! Can we change the subject? Say, how far did you go? Nothing... Not even kissing? We held hands in the street though. Dang, you're not into that kind of things? Well... I do but.. Tatoe won't do anything. Wow... He cares about you. If you haven't ever kissed Nishimura... So, was it your first kiss then? Oh that... Yes, it was. Should we do it properly? What? Hello? Yes... It's alright, thanks. I'm going this way. Thanks for today. There are some drops in credit score.. But still safe for receiving recommendation. Oh... She also volunteered to be a member of the festival committee, And does a lot for the class as well. Is that so? Looks like she's taking things seriously. In general, I think she should aim for better deal. It's fine. It would be troubling if I couldn't follow after joining. What a serious girl! - Thank you. - Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. Hello. Ah, here! For you. The kamaboko I produce! Here, here! Is it alright? Yes. You two are very beautiful! If you'll excuse me. I'll be taking these! Do you know him? I don't. How about a family restaurant? Well, I'll go back because I forgot something. What? I'll be downstairs! Thank you very much. Well, playing around Tokyo is going to be a real-world experience for you. Yes... I think this is a great thing to let you do whatever you want for now (four years, at very least). I've got plenty of experience playing around myself too. I told you to be wary of weird girls. If he keeps going like this, there won't be any problem. But yeah? You want to see your mum, don't you? Seems like they've been in touch behind my back. I don't. Thanks for your work today! Good job! Now that you have gathered here, Why don't we put our heart into a prayer, be it for exam, or for love even for world's peace! Okay! Hey. Say. Yeah? Can we go home? But you're not done painting yet. Nobody will come check on it. But you've been painting it as whole! That will make it look like it's the same color. Why can't we paint it with similar color? Got it. I'll do the rest. Will it be okay? Nishimura.. You should go back home too. Well... Do you mind helping me? I don't. Really? Thank you. Okay so... Thanks for today. Sorry but we're counting on you. Leaving you the rest! We did great. I'm sorry for making you stay here. Don't worry, I kind of enjoy doing this. Really? You're just trying to be nice. I'm not. Let's continue. Yeah. What? Ah, sorry! Wait! Let's leave! They got away! Please wait! Oh, dang! You know, Miyuki told me. Excuse me? She didn't tell you? We've been getting along these days. Is that so... When I heard you two were dating. I was so surprised. Was it supposed to stay secret? It's not much of a big deal When she told me you were her boyfriend. I was very surprised. Because I've always had feelings for you. Ever since we started high school but I couldn't bring myself to talk to you. I was happy to be in the same class as you again. I know I told you first.. I'll definitely tell Miyuki. Ah, I see. Am I that bad? I really like you though! I feel like you're turning a blind eye. What? Sorry. I'm sorry I don't get it. I don't know how to put it into words... It looks like you're lying. That I like you?! Not really... About who you are. I finally gathered courage and you're being mean to me?! I'm sorry. Nishimura... You hate people as much as you don't reject them. And despite that hatred, you take a good care of your woman. I get why you like Miyuki. She's kind, fragile and is in her own world. Pretending that you belong in the same world as her to overlook her for a sense of comfort. Then why don't you two just curl up in your world forever? To Tatoe, it's finally spring again. I got worried because you seemed to have lost weight last time. You used to say that success is the only way to prove yourself right. You will definitely pass your exams. The day you will be free from your father will surely come. I know you hate this city but... I'm attached to it. But I will follow you as soon as you decide to leave the city. I'd like to stay with you forever." Stop. Ai, sorry but where's your motivation? Sorry. Do you mind changing position with Yukako? We'll start again then. Ai. I came to see you! You look like the goddess of cuteness. This is still rehearsal, you know? It's gonna be crowded when the performance starts, so I came in advance. Ah, yeah. Have you seen my LINE message? I'm sorry, which one? The one saying I wanted to hang out again. Are you busy? Yeah, when? Anytime. How about... Now? What? Okay, let's start. Hey, Kimura Ai! What? Why are you asking? Wait, wait, wait! Here, for you. I don't want it. Are you for real? By the way, why do you stop coming to cram school? I don't have a reason to attend one anyway. -You've got a recommendation, don't you? - How do you know? Where are you going? Are you alright? That was something... I guess you needed to talk to me? Not really, why? You looked like you had something in mind. Well... I do have one thing though. I don't want things to be awkward between us... You might know it but. Ever since I got into high school, I never had any friends... It was super nice to be able to hang out with you... I was thinking that maybe we could forget that... And go back to be just friends. Forget it? I really don't want to hear that from you. I'm sorry. Do you have any idea how much I like you? What? I thought you were just joking... Joking?! I was being all desperate and you thought that it was a joke? What did Nishimura tell you? What? Ah, sorry... I didn't tell Tatoe that we kissed. Huh? I'm sorry... Hum... Do you want me to leave you alone? Not really... We finally became friends so I don't really want to loose you now... I've never considered you my friend though. Because I've always had feelings for you. But.. You must find me disgusting. Because you're a girl? No way! But you only like boys, don't you? Rather than liking men or women. I just fall for people as they are. In terms of physiology, though? I don't really get it but I'm content with the time we spent together, even when we're not touching each other... You and Nishimura might be okay with that but... I'm different. If you want me to stop, say it. Don't worry. I was like that for my first time too. Miyuki? You have someone over? Yes! A friend! Didn't we have sweets or something? From school? The girl I went to the cinema with. Didn't we have plum-flavered jelly? You ate them all! I didn't-! You did! When did I? The day before yesterday... Oh, I ate them all! That's amazing. The way you go back to your daughter role after that. It's because I love my mum. Can I sleep for a while? Sure. Sleepy? Yes. I can't really sleep at night these days. What are you going to do after graduation? I guess I'll try to get a university... Same. Yes... I'm not sure I want to keep going to school for another four months... Is that so? Is there something you'd like to do? Not really. But... I would like to be useful to people. What are you saying? Which month were you born on? March. Oh... Lots of people born in march are peculiar. I've the feeling a friend from middle school who was peculiar too. Ai... I'm a terrible person. In middle school... My blood sugar had not gone down, even though I was already home. I was very tired and hungry but... I went to the bathroom to lower it. And then.. My mum opened the door. She asked me if it was okay to take a bath with such a blood sugar level. Hearing it, I got unreasonably mad. So I hit the bathroom's door using all my strength. The glass shattered. And my hand was covered in blood. My mum brought me to the hospital. I thought I would get yelled at when we got back home... My father didn't say anything and cleaned the mess. One minute left! At that time, I made a decision. I decided not to live for my sake but... For the sake of someone I cared about. I've lived too much for myself. The test is over now. Please gather the answer sheets from the back. About the last test. Can you explain this? I'm sorry. I didn't know what to write. You were doing great last semester. Yes... Ah, Kimura! Let's take a picture! But I... Doesn't look that flashy on presentation, but still, you've won an award after all. Here. Nishimura, get in! There. I didn't do anything though. You two stayed late to finish it, didn't you? Right? Then go! Please hold it together. Okay? Say Cheese! One more! Cheese! It looks like you just got a marriage certificate. Any of you can keep the paper. Seems like this will be kept here until spring. It came out nice. Yeah. Do you want it? Besides, I left halfway through. If you want it, you can have it. Is it okay? You worked super hard on it. I'll take it then. You want it? Yeah, as a souvenir. Thank you. Sorry, there's nobody here. Are you alright? Miyuki? What is it? I had something to do here. She won't come. I was the one who sent you that message. I see. I had sex with Miyuki, you know? Twice. She was very into it. Did you hear me? I did. Do you think I'm lying? No, you're telling the truth. Please be mine. Put your clothes back on. Go dress. I hate people like you! Aggressive, doing whatever they want. Without thinking about hurting other people. Stealing whatever they want. Do you even know how I felt when I found Miyuki? I know! Cause I've always watched you! Hate me all you want! If you can't be mine then please hate me I can't bear being only your classmate! Your simple gestures I caught in tranquility... and the words we exchanged from time to time... That won't satisfy me! Even in this moment, I'm happy I get to talk with you. I'm happy I could get closer to you. Let me go. I don't want to. I won't! Please be mine! How could I be yours? Hold me. And kiss me. Satisfied? Yes... If you are then show me. What a fake smile. Much more hideous than your usual fake smile. It's beyond compare. Your eyes are dark. That's the smile of someone who only likes themselves. That would be nice if for once For other people or for me.. You could be true to yourself. When I woke up in the morning... Even though this is not the season, there was a mosquito in my room. I crushed one within my palms but... The mosquito didn't take any of my blood. Ai... How was your day? Where did you go? What did you eat? Who did you talk to? James I was originally Scotland's King. However, he inherited the throne of England. England and Scotland. These two regions were brought together. However... James I. Tatoe! Thank you. Also... I brought this one on the way home. but there are a lot of them. Maybe a bit too much? Please give me two of them then. Sure. Thank you. I might pass the test so. When I do. I'd like you to come with me. Yes. This royalist and parliamentary faction... The Puritan Revolution finally broke out due to these two conflicts. But in a word, they were bound to be factions despite being parliamentary. I think it could be easier for you to understand if you compared it to the Japanese diet. Kimura, wait! Kimura! Say, Ai? This is really bad! People found and are gossiping! Right? Well, yeah. Are you okay? What are you guys? Dating? Sex friends? I don't even get what you're saying. If we were sex friends.. Would you think it's stupid? I wouldn't. Sorry. Tatoe passed the entrance exam. Is that so? Yes... Wasn't it a rumor in the class? I don't really know. I see... I've been thinking of following him there. Have you passed an entrance exam too? I didn't. I passed one here but, I only took the exam on behalf of my parents. I've always promised I would follow him as soon as he is finally free from here. What's your plan there? Preparing for entrance exam next year? What if he finds another girl, what will you do? I'll find a job I can do. If one day... Tatoe ever meets someone else... I would understand. What a nice girl. Ai, wait! Wait! What? Let's talk? It's fine, forget about me. There's no way I could. Besides.. I want to talk to Tatoe about you! Why would you even? It's fine, it was just a game. It wasn't! You know, I had feelings for Nishimura. What? I had feelings for Nishimura. I came into the classroom and read your letters... I found out about your relationship. This is why I approached you. Nishimura rejected me when I confessed to him. Sorry for being a bitch to you. So you don't have to tell him. That would only hurt him if he knew. You're such a nice girl, you'll definitely find friends in Tokyo. I know it might be tough with your health conditions but... Please be safe. You're scary. I know I am. Sorry. I didn't mean it like this. That whole thing was a lie.. About liking Nishimura? Not that... You haven't reflected on anything, have you? What? Of course I did! You didn't. Why? The way you look at me. That dark deep gaze. Dad is having a drinking party tonight. We're having a hot pot though... I know right? If only he told me earlier... I love hot pots though. Nice! Tatoe passed the entrance test for a university in Tokyo. Really? What a nice thing to hear! So... I've been thinking of following him there. Let's talk about this when Dad comes back. You still have a long way to go. But Sir... Once a failure always a failure. Leaving the classroom in the middle of a lesson. Everyone around you is surprised. You only think about yourself! Kimura! Hey! Kimura! There! Ai? What's going on? Let me go! I'm in a hurry. Where are you going? There's some stuff going on at Tatoe's place.. His house? What happened? I think his father found out about everything. How? Are you going to take this bus? Can I come with you? Next stop is Ishigaki. Ai... Why are you coming with me? Are you Tatoe's friends? Please come in! Excuse me Here, here! It's cold outside, isn't it? Excus- You can come in! I'm sorry. It's usually not that messy. Tatoe... Take a seat! Here, take a seat! Please let Tatoe leave the house. Tatoe... How smart of you to have passed that exam. You're just like your mother. Not the sharpest knife in the drawer... Must've been tough. But, yeah? You understand nothing about life. This is why I'm not letting you go. Please, try these! Here, here! Soft, isn't it? Texture is the most important thing to make kamaboko good. Say, which one is it? Which one? That girl who wrote you the letters. To think you did that in secret... Disgusting. Tatoe! The two of you are pitiful. Hey, look at me! Why are you guys so dumb? There's no point in studying hard to get away from that guy. But.. Do you really think he would accept if you ever passed? I think the same. Tatoe... I know we've been dating for a long time but... There always was distance between us. How cold... Are you okay? Want one? Yes. Here, write something for your father. What's the occasion? Nothing special. You only got the nail shape from me.. I could recognize you even if your face disappeared. You once said that I like Miyuki because we share the same world. Did I? Some time ago, I guess. That wasn't the reason. Is that so... I can't even remember. However... I like her because she's not like me. Being with her sometimes makes me think that I have to share her suffering. But I don't know for sure. Coming at me for love advice is a bit... I could put my eyes out for your sake. S© please stay with me until I lose my eyesight. How about this? Will you finally fall in love with me? Will you? Please stop. You won't, will you? You don't have to worry about me then. Here is the exit, then you'll be in line according to your class. The upperclassmen will come from here, and place a flower to your pocket. This will be assigned by attendance number, so please be in line accordingly. It'll become a great mess, if we have you to choose ..who you want to receive the flower from. That will be yet another event you have afterward. What's with those gloomy faces? Not that I have any other choice. Then, you will enter from here... "Hello, You once told me that people born in March are often peculiar. 'Rockstar dies at the age of 27.' In this classroom, where everyone subconsciously believes... they'll die young anyway regardless... I will live much longer than anyone else. The day I was born, my illness... They're both like wrinkles craved on my palm. Thank you for teaching me how it feels like to be touched. Ai, who is selfish and knows no patience... If only you could be patient with me, Even if it's out of self-regard.... Even for a split second. If that means you're opening your heart to me... I'll cherish that moment forever." Let's sleep together again?
