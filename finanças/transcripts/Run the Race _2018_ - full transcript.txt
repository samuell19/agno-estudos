You think he's here? Dad doesn't... I don't care about Dad. I'm talking about the Florida scout. Why would there be a Florida scout here? 'Cause that Jenkins kid from the other team, his dad's a Gator scout. If he's here, this could be my only chance to be seen. Dave, this is... this is it.

I know you said how important it is for you to get a scholarship, and you have absolutely worked your tail off this year. I'm proud of you. All right, Simms. Mr. Polack. Coach. Thank you. I appreciate you saying that. But what did I tell you is the best way to get seen by these coaches and scouts? Um, take the team to State? Don't you forget it. Yes, sir. This came for you in the mail today. Congrats. You're on somebody's radar, son. What? [laughing] [laughing] [Zach] Bring any marshmallows? [Dave] We're out. [Dave] We gonna talk about this, or what? What? Your letter. [laughing] What about it? I'm just really proud of you. Thanks, man. I mean, it's not a big deal. It's just a letter saying that there's interest... - Shut up. It's happening. - You're right. It's a big deal, dude. It's the Florida Gators. The Florida Gators. It's cool, man. I mean, it just shows that it's not some fantasy that I've built up in my head, you know? It's real. It's happening. We'll see. Yeah, I'm gonna get that scholarship. I'm gonna get us out of here. You have my word. And we'll get better cereal once we're out. Excuse me. Is there, like, a Coke machine around here or something? Yeah. Follow this main hall back around to the cafeteria. There's one there. Aren't you a little young to be a nurse? Not to be a nurse intern though, which is what I am. Okay, that makes sense. I'm Zach. Zach Truett, the running back at Bessemer. That's great. Yeah. We are undefeated, you know? All right. Zach, it's been really nice to meet you. Best part of my day, but I don't date football players. Ouch. I was thinking about getting two Cokes from that Coke machine. Now I'm not so sure. I might just have to get one. I'm a Dr. Pepper girl, so... See, that's a shame. Ginger, can I get an IV in five? Yep. On it. I'm gonna convert you. Take care. - I think she digs me. What do you think? - [Dave] Yo. Hey. What's up, man? How did it go? Went for an annual checkup. I'm 45 days without any problems, so... That's good. Did they give you a lollipop and a sticker too? Not this time. You didn't by chance have a really hot nurse, did you? Like, 75 years old, smoker's cough, gray hair. Nope. Martha? Martha's all yours, bud. [man announcing] Hey, Bessemer fans. You're witnessing something special here tonight with Zach Truett. 203 yards, two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, and the boy is putting together a season like, well, I've never seen. I'm hungry. I was kinda feeling like salmon. You want some salmon? I like salmon. That's a high-class meal, dude. I know. I can't really cook salmon. Good luck with that. I want some noodles. What kind of noodles? Like, some ramen noodles, dude. Hey, Truett! We got room for one more. What are you guys doing here? Hey. Could you cover for me? It's getting old. No, I know, but...

Did you say something? I brought you some soup. Homemade. Chicken and dumplings, just like you like. You're awesome. Where's Zach? He's icing his leg. He should be back by 10:30 though. I heard he scored five times. Yeah, it was almost six. You should have been there. Well, I've seen enough football to last me a lifetime. After watching you take that hit last year? Them carting you off the field. Your body all locked up the way it was. No, thank you. No, sir. And then, like a crazy woman, you jumped out of the stands and ran out onto the field to help me. I wasn't coming to tend to you. I was looking for that middle linebacker who put you in the dirt with a cheap shot. I'm not afraid to give somebody the business on a Friday, ask for forgiveness on a Sunday. Good night, Nanny. Five, four, three, two, one. Baby! Right on the dot. It was a buzzer beater, but it's 10:27. Yeah. How 'bout that? - Smells like you had a good time. - It was one beer, Dad. Come on. Let's stack some bathroom tissue. Dude, those guys are the worst. You're the worst. When you lie down with dogs... You wake up with fleas, Shakespeare. I get it. You can read. You know what I mean. Yeah. Did Nanny ask about me? Yeah, yeah. She actually made chicken and dumplings. Oh! So good. I'm never gonna find a lady that can make chicken and dumplings the way Nanny can. It's a shame. She's ruined me for all womankind. It's a tragedy, really. It was good. I killed the whole thing. - You what? - You were at your other thing. Are you kidding me? I just figured you wouldn't mind. What are you thinking, man? Come on! All right, put me down! I'm mad at you, man. Stack your dog food, apron boy. Get some work done. Here you go. And it's on the house. You make sure you get us a win this week, okay, Zach? You got it. And how about I dedicate my first touchdown to you, my lady? Yeah. Yeah? You're so cheesy. She smiled. Yeah. She also graduated high school the year you were born. Oh, Davey.

Why didn't you say anything? Don't see why I'd waste my breath on this guy. I heard you're doing real well on the football field this season, Zachary. Did you? Yeah. In fact, rumor has it that you're gonna shatter all my district records. Yeah. No, I'm gonna wipe your name off the record books. You can count on that. We're family. You think that's supposed to mean something? It does. It means everything. It means nothing. We're family. You're some dude that left us after our mom died. Dave, let's go. Really? All right.

Anything can... What's going on with your knee? I don't know. I don't know. It looks like a torn ACL, Coach. So this the end of our football season? A chance for a scholarship for this boy.

Or flip it around like... Other way. We need your butt exposed. Wow. Quite forward. Let me specify. The doctors need your back exposed. Oh, okay. You're feisty. Very highbrow humor, Zach. You smiled. I saw it. Mm-mmm. Are you sure about that? Yeah. I have a streak. Tomorrow's five months, no smiles. [laughs] Okay, well... Absolutely not. I just broke your streak, I think. If I were... Look. There it is again. Okay. He's gonna be fine, honey. Sorry. Nervous habit. Your daddy know about Zach? We haven't really talked that much. Your father's a mess, but he still is your father. He's never really even tried to apologize. Well, maybe he doesn't know how. Maybe he's too proud, too broken. Losing your mama hurt him too.

But technically, you could clear me? I mean, taking your medication every time before you run is an absolute must. So, I got cleared to run track. What? Yeah. I ran back in and asked the doctor. She says I'm all good. She says it's safe for you? Yeah. She cleared me, didn't she? Yeah. I guess. That's awesome, man. That's gonna be cool.

I know that I just make everything worse, and, um... It's okay, Dad. I forgive you. Two Christmases without her? How 'bout two Christmases without us? Your sons. - We still could have been a family! - We are a family... We're not a family. Come on, Zach. Why you always sticking up for him? Because he's our dad! No, he is not our dad! He's a drunk and a coward. And he is not my father! Why don't you have a minute with your mother? You don't have to go, Dad. You're a good boy, Dave. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. What kind of man walks out on his two boys after their mom dies of cancer? A broken one. And that's a good enough answer for you? [Zach] Man, that thing's been here since we were kids. Did they ever figure out who broke off baby Jesus' leg? Wasn't that you? Yeah, I know, but I'm just wondering if they ever figured that out. [Dave] You all right? Yeah. It's just bringing back old memories or whatever. [Pastor] We all could use a moment. I'm not just talking about being in the moment, but one of life's beautiful moments. I'm talking about a game-changing, seismic shift, capital-"M" moment. Amen. You know what I mean? Where after that, everything in your life seems different. We're here to celebrate a moment like that this evening. - I know you know what I'm talking about. - Amen. Yeah, I'm talking about the birth of Jesus. A moment with a capital "M." After that moment, history would change. That's right. Praise the Lord. But most of us, we don't get to have our moment. Because we suffer from an affliction called "The Somedays." And it goes something like this Someday, I'm really gonna listen more and not just talk. Someday, I'm gonna pour into my kids. Someday, I'm gonna get right with all that God stuff. I'm gonna get spiritually aligned. God's gift to us... was Jesus. [man] Thank you, Lord. So that one day, our someday could become our moment. Davey, we've gotta get out of here, man. I am so sick of Bessemer. [sighs] I don't want to get stuck here, you know? End up like Dad. I'd rather us be running to something instead of from something. It doesn't matter. It's just time to run.

My breath smells like coffee. So, when you meet my dad... Yeah? ...don't worry. He can come off a little intimidating, but he's really a total softy. - He'll just hit you with some small talk. - I can do small talk. Tell me what you like about my daughter, Zach. Dad. Just getting right to it. No, I love it. That's cool. That's a good question. It's an easy one to answer. I think she's pretty great to be around. You know, I like spending time with her. She's obviously very beautiful. I see the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, ma'am. Well... thank you, Zach. You're very welcome. Don't make eyes at my wife, son. Um... I was just making a joke. [laughs] - So was I. - Okay. Sorry. And what do you think about Jesus? Um, this small talk... It's important to us to know who's dating our daughter. Yeah. Of course. No, I get that. Um... I'm just... I'm just a little afraid, I guess, that if I tell you guys how I feel, you might not let me see Ginger again. Well, at least you're honest, so we're off to a good start. Okay. Well... I don't know where to begin. I guess I know a lot about Jesus. But I'm not sure I really know him the way my mother did and my brother does and maybe the way you guys do. I grew up in church and everything... but as I got older, I started asking all these, you know, questions, and now there's just a lot of things I'm unsure about. Like what? Well... if you really want to know, I don't understand why Jesus would leave towns before everybody was healed. I don't understand why all of Jesus' disciples died these terrible deaths. I mean, Peter was crucified upside down, and he was one of Jesus' best friends. So that doesn't really add up for me. I guess I just... I don't understand why terrible people get to live to be a hundred and amazing people like my mother were taken away too early. [chuckles] By the way, I get that I'm totally blowing this whole meet-the-parents-for-dinner thing. Not at all. I'm sorry. No. You're not the first person sitting at this table to wrestle with his faith. Trust me. Yes, sir. - Can we eat? - Yes, please. Let's eat. [Zach] Hey. What's wrong? Zach, I really like you. I guess I didn't realize how you felt. What, about God? I thought that was between me and him. Yeah, but it's important to me, and you know that. [sighs] I get it, all right? I do. I get the whole Jesus thing. And I did it for a long time. But things happen, and people change. God doesn't change. Zach, he loves you, whether you want him to or not. I can't just snap my fingers and make everything okay. But then again, I don't have a huge house and nice things and perfect parents. You just trust him. He's gonna meet you wherever you're at. Really? It's that simple? Man, I've just had the switch turned to off the whole time. The one that says, "trust God." I'm an idiot. I should just turn it on. Then I can be good enough for your little club. You know that that's not what I'm saying, Zach. It sure sounds like it. You look cold. You should probably go inside. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for coming tonight, Zach. [sighs] [engine starts] [angry grunt] [exhales] [woman singing country on speakers] Hey. Mike, is this your boy? - What are you talking about? - Right here. Yeah. Yeah, that's my boy. Looks like he's running track now. Track? It's a football town, man. He'll be running around like Ms. Pacman. [imitating electronic chirping] He mentioned thanking some people in here too. But not you. Well, you know what? Donald, maybe he forgot. He's a teenager, and kids forget. They ain't got no respect these days. That's what I think. Your boy, he's running his butt off, man. He's good. You know, he takes first place tomorrow, he's going to State? I guess he figures he's gotta make up for his brother, who ruined your football season. You know, it's the least he can do, right, Coach? [Donald] Ruined it for the whole town. These boys, they've been dealt a tough hand, D. They been through a lot. Hey. We've all been through a lot, Bill. Yeah, but your boys are different. They're amazing. They're resilient. They're special. I don't need your help with my kids, Bill. Yeah, you do. Your boys don't need a coach. They need a dad, Mike. The whole world's going crazy, spinning out of control, and somehow your boys have managed so far to make it. You're gonna look up one day, and they will have moved on. To Gainesville, Jacksonville, maybe. Somewhere, but not here. Not Bessemer. And you're gonna miss 'em, Mike. And that game will be over, Dad.

[Dave] God, just asking you, watch over me and keep me safe out there, and help me perform to the best of my abilities in a way that honors you. Whatever is part of your plan, I trust that you've got my back. Dave. Amen. Dave. What are you doing, man? Everyone's out there warming up. Just a pregame routine. Is he gonna stretch for you too? Let's get out there, man. - All right. - Let's go! I'll be out there in a minute. All right. [announcer] Welcome back, Rebel fans, to the 3A Area track and field championships. Getting ready to start is the Boys' 400 Meter where former Bessemer quarterback David Truett has fought his way back from a career-ending head injur to challenge as the dark horse in this new arena. Hey, good to see you, Coach. Good to see you. Good to see you, Coach. Good to see you, now. All right. Good luck to you. [man] Thank you. Hey, Truett. What size is that shirt, man? Extra small? You got this, all right? You got this. [announcer] Truett will be running in lane five, and right next to last year's area champ, Justin Nole, in lane four. Runners, on your mark. Set! - [starter pistol fires] - [crowd cheering] Come on, Dave! There you go, bud. Keep it up! Keep it up! [announcer] Don't blink. Just one lap, folks. Nole is out to a quick lead. Oh, my Lord. My heart can't take this. There's not much separation as they come out of turn two down the backstretch. They're neck and neck. It's Nole in the lead. Come on, man. You got this. - Truett pulls into third as we round out of the last turn. - Yes! - Come on, Truett! - Dave, move! - Here they come down the front stretch. - Come on, boy. Come on! Come on! - Go, go, go! - Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Kick that into gear, Dave! And it's too close to call! What a finish! We're gonna have to wait from confirmation from the judges. And Truett wins it with a 49! Yeah! He's your new 3A area... Yes. ...track and field champion. [crowd cheering] Thank you, Coach. Congratulations, son. Are you kidding me? - Faith is a beautiful thing, isn't it? - Amen. Isn't it a beautiful thing? It is. If you don't believe and have faith in your football coach, you're not gonna listen to him, are you? No. You don't have faith in him. But if he tells you to get out and put in the work, and do the exercises, and you don't put in that work, you're not gonna win a lot of games, are you? No. Faith is beautiful. Yes, it is. Faith with action. That's our homework. That's all of our homework, isn't it? Take that faith in your heart. Put it into action. - Can I get an amen? - [congregation] Amen! Yes. Thank you, sir. Great sermon. Thank you. Nice. See you later. It's good to see you here, Pop. Yeah. I'm thinking about making some changes. Plus, I don't have anything better to do on Sunday, so... You never told me how things went with Ginger. Well, that's because I haven't quite figured it out yet. You want to talk about it? Nope. What'd you do? What'd I do? Nothing. You sabotage your own relationships. You know that. Oh, no, I don't. Look, you just don't want to wait too long and lose her, man. Maybe I do. I'll admit, man, I guess I have some things I can work on, but... we all do. Well, you have a little more than others. If I let her go, I'm an idiot, aren't I? I'm gonna assume that's a rhetorical question? Shut up. Come on, let's go. One last race before State this weekend. Loser does the dishes. All right. And for clarification, yes, you are an idiot.

I can't tell you that I know what his plan is, but I do know that all things work for good. Of course. All things work for good 'cause so many good things have happened in my life. Come here. Come. Sit down here. When I was 21, doctors found tumors on both of my ovaries. When I found out I couldn't have kids, I cried for a year straight, every day. Now, your grandmother... [exhales] her and I... I never had a sister, but if I did, it would have been that fine lady. I never knew her. Oh, I wish you had. She was good and kind. Strong. She could admit when she was wrong, and she stood up for what was right. She had a heart for God and she passed all that down to your mama. And your mama passed it down to you boys. Now, I was there when you and Dave were born. And every birthday since, I didn't miss a one, you know that. I've watched you boys grow up to be men. Seen more of your life than your grandma and your mama ever could. And I don't know why that is... but I'm eternally grateful. You see... I was that girl, at 21, who thought that God had forgotten about her. But now, the woman at 65... sees what God's plan was all along. And I was supposed to be y'all's Nanny. And I wouldn't trade that for anything in the whole wide world. Now, I know life can be confusing. It's full of ups and downs. It doesn't mean God isn't real or that he doesn't love you. Because God does love you. He loves you like crazy. I couldn't have asked for a better Nanny. Come here. I love you boys like you were my own. I love you too. Go.

And as I was praying for you, I started praying for me. You know? I walked into that house not believing, and I walked out... Come here. I love you. - [Zach] One more lap? - Yeah. Is that cool? Look, I just want to say that I'm really sorry. For what? I really thought it was part of the plan for me to run tomorrow and get us out of here. Hey, you don't need to be sorry for that. So it wasn't part of the plan. You know what? Maybe there's something better waiting for us. It was just so clear to me. And I'm... just really sorry that I let you down. Hey. Davey. You didn't let me down, bud. You couldn't let me down. All right? Why don't you run in my place? What? Look, if... if you stay here, nothing changes, we're stuck. But if you run tomorrow, you never know what can happen. That could be our last chance at getting out of here. Don't you want to take it? - Your knee's good to run? - Yeah, my knee's great, Coach. I've been training with Dave the whole track season. Sticking with him, step for step. Coach. I mean, this is really important for me. It's important for Dave. I can see that. I'll probably have to sign you in as your brother. That doesn't sound very official though. You know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but... I'll take the heat. Truth is, may not be the worst thing for me to get fired from this track coach job. Guys running around in a circle, it never really interested me. You hand a young man a ball and have folks try to tackle him? That is a sport. Yeah, Coach. That's football. Yeah, well, you see my point. Yeah. You boys are due some breaks. I'll do anything I can to help you, son. Thank you, Coach. Yeah. [Coach] Let me make a couple calls. I'll get you cleared to run. Zach. What are you doing in here, son? Coach, you really think I can win this? [sighs] Well... [sighs] these boys out there... they're all real track athletes. They been training all year, maybe their whole lives, for this moment. Coach, if this is a pep talk, it really needs some work. But... I know, without a shadow of a doubt that they don't have the heart or the drive that you have. I've never seen someone sprint down a sideline the way that you do, son. Whoo! You think any of these fellas out there could catch you on a football field? No, sir. Right. So you're really just running four football fields then, aren't you? A turn here, turn there. Yeah. Just remember, you're only running against yourself. You got about 45 seconds to give it all that you got. It's you against the clock. So, come on. There's someone I want you to meet. Hey, Zach. Coach tells me your knee's back in playing shape. Yes, sir. Yeah. It's better than ever. Well, good. Good. I'm looking forward to seeing what you got out there. Man, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you scouted track too. I don't. Good luck.

That may sound like a funny thing to say about your little brother. You see, he taught me, in life there are only two ways you can be running: to God or from God. And I spent so much time running from God. And I'm pretty fast. And looking back, it wasn't his death, but the way Dave lived his life. How he never gave up on me, and not only showed me love, but the truth. That's what turned me around. [cheering] And the moment I did, Jesus was there with his arms wide open. I just want to encourage anyone who feels like they're running in life... to stop, turn around and embrace who's chasing them. 'Cause I'll tell you what. He loves you. He loves you like crazy.
