Dragonfly Seagull's heading towards the meeting point. Time for action. Copy that, Dragonfly. Over and out. Dragonfly, this is Ringmaster. Once inside you'll have only three minutes to get to the bookkeeper. Roger that. I want this clean and quick. Let's go. Dragonfly, listen to me very carefully. Seagull is compromised. We're calling off the mission. Seagull. Seagull. It was an ambush. Agni, abort mission. Secure yourself and return to the safe house. Do it. Agni, abort mission. It's an order. Agni! Agni! Shit. Don't be scared. You're safe. Found the girls, Ringmaster. Send backup. Get a grip on your agent. This will prove costly. Can she identify the killer? In my experience, in cases like these, children tend to forget every memory of those terrible events. These memories could return in a stressful situation. We call it 'repressed memories'. Whiskey. You made me lose a pickup line. Which one? The 'Can I buy you a drink' one. That's a waste on me. It takes me much more than a drink, to get wasted and be in bed with someone. I am sure that smile can beat them all. Well, these lips can do more than just smile. Let's see what else they can do. Your place or mine? Let me get my car keys. I know you're still furious over Seagull... Seagull wasn't our agent. It was never your call. Do you ever care about permissions, protocols, Agni? FSB has raised a storm. They want me to replace you. The information on the flash drive has been decoded. We're challenging Asia's largest human trafficking syndicate. They are spreading their roots, in entire eastern Europe. They knew Seagull is coming. It was an ambush. Someone didn't want us to get our hands on this information. So... maybe they got a mole inside the Russian FSB, or maybe among us. So from now, operational details will remain between you and I. The Indian wing of this syndicate, operates from central India's coal mining belt. The names of those who run it. Rudraveer. 10 years ago, we almost caught him in the Gulf. He's been off the radar ever since. Rohini. Handles the money. She's the brain behind the operations. And the others follow her orders. We've made arrangements for your immediate return to India. No, I'm not going to India! You know the kind of memories that India brings back to me. And if I go to India, I'll never be able to return. Please. Bygones... Your past... Don't let it ruin your future. I raised you as a warrior. You're a fighter. It's time to fight for those innocent girls. If I've done my duty by raising you properly, then you must fulfill your duty for my sake. - Not to India, please! - No. We have an asset there, Fazal. He will receive you. And I'm warning you... This time you will not go against without my orders. Just remember... We're only gathering information there, Nothing else. So good luck, and... Be safe, my Dragonfly. Sir... What's this joke, sir? Here I am risking my life, and my child's... And you've sent an Air hostess to fight this war. Come on. This air hostess is a firecracker. It's 2022, but louts like you still don't understand, that harassing women is... Not cool! Madam. Birju, if you have a death wish, Then just throw yourself under the bus. She's treating you with kid gloves. Don't try to act tough, or she'll knock the daylights out of you. You should carry a lady's bag, not steal it. Give it to me. Let's go, boys. - Welcome, madam. - Let's go. Found the asset. And received the gear. All good here. Find information on Rohini's personal bodyguard Khalid. He can lead us to Rudraveer. And don't get distracted. I won't. How long have you been working for the agency? For the last four to five years. Who was that boy at the bus stop? Birju. Took me a while to befriend him. He keeps an eye on everyone. What do you know about Rudraveer? A lot. Please, take a seat. This will take a while. Please eat. I'm a decent cook. Start! Madam, a wise man waits for coal to turn into a diamond. But Rudraveer had other plans. For him, coal was as valuable as diamonds. and he made a fortune out of it. Stop! Run. Run guys, he's coming. Rudra! So now you'll shed your father's blood for money. Our land, our mines, And it's run by the government? I've only taken one bag from what's mine. What's wrong is wrong! I haven't killed my father. I have toppled the government. Let's go. Rudraveer wasn't any good with money, but Rohini was born for it. I didn't hold back in giving you pleasure, So why're you holding back my money? What happened? The cash. Count it. It's short by five notes. She's right. I am a merchant's daughter. I've played with money more than dolls. We'll stay in touch. Rudraveer took care of Rohini, and she took care of his money. Madam, when a leader is born, followers come flocking soon. Wherever Rudraveer spotted a sharp mind, he corrupted it. In no time, that newbie built an army of kids. Love and social work, both on in full swing. As Rudraveer's empire expanded, Rohini got promoted from retail to corporate. The brothel madam who got Rohini into the flesh trade, Rohini killed her... And took over her business. Rudraveer wasn't operating like a phantom on his own. He had Shamsher watching over him. Yours balls haven't dropped yet. As your reputation grows, So will your payment... got it? Get lost! Shamsher measured status by stature. So Rudraveer upped his stature. People like Rudraveer don't wait for their fortunes to grow. They fast-track the process. This bucket of water isn't for you to drown. You have to cross the river of life, and live to tell the tale. Come on. Watch my reputation grow now. Shamsher was reduced to a horrific example. Rudraveer and Rohini, Their beginnings arose out of necessity... I have no doubts about that. But they carried on for fun and passion, I have no doubts about that either. People say that Rudraveer is a bad human being. But madam, the truth is that he is anything but human. Because if he was human, he would be seen. Animals and monsters do a better job hiding than human beings. And that's how Rudraveer built his empire, madam. Should we start working on its downfall? You seem to be in a hurry, madam. Papa. Sweetheart, you're still awake! Madam, can I go tuck her in? Rohini's personal bodyguard... Bad manners. At least let me say hello to your friend. Go ahead. Hi, Zaira. Hi. Agni. Goodnight. Come after you finish, papa. Okay, child. Don't think too much, madam. She's just like her mother. Rohini's personal bodyguard Khalid, where can we find him? I've been keeping an eye on him for a long time. He's a compulsive gambler. The old areas of Suhagpur are gambling hubs. That's where you'll find him. Let's bet on him, then. Come one, come all. Come and place your bets. Believe me, madam, this is a very dangerous place. Should we go back? Hello. Listen to me, madam, let's go back. You seem like you don't have any family, but I do. These guys will tear us to shreds. Your boy is gonna win, and make you win as well. Come one, come all. Come and place your bets. Madam, what are you doing? Brother Khalid, she's an amazing photographer. She's just going to take pictures. If she takes your pictures, you'll be world-famous. On Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, the works. You'll be a star, believe me. Listen, you chicken. I won't pose in the same picture as these amateurs. Calm down. Calm down, guys. I mean peace... Peace out? Please. Down... Listen, you low-life... Beautiful. Tell madam to take pictures of the winners. Yes. Because losers will be too embarrassed to show their face. Understood. Okay! Works. Ladies, gentlemen, and fans. In one corner there's Kaale Khan, and in the other corner we have Neele Khan. Gosh, they're nicknamed after their underwear! Players, begin. Hold his leg. His leg... Great move. Go Kaale. Go Kaale. Grab him. Grab his leg. Another one. Khalid's boy is losing. We won't get his picture. Do something. I am so stressed. So stressed! Go Kaale! Go Kaale! - Go Kaale! - Bravo! - Go Kaale! - Bravo! What's got into him? Bravo! I made 5000 from just 500. Go Kaale! And with that Kaale Khan is the winner. So hot! So hot. This light, you look very... handsome in it. Give me your phone, I'll take your profile pose. Which pose, madam? Side pose. Side pose. Give me your phone, Front, side, back... click from any angle you like. Naughty boy! Give me your phone. I'd love getting my picture taken by you, madam. Side pose, please. So hot. Little more side. Yes. Oh wow. Your girlfriends will be pleased to see this. No girlfriend. You... my girlfriend. Madam, your husband Gabriel Khan is waiting. Bye, Khalid! Wait, you wretch! What information did you get? Morning, sir. Did you find anything on Khalid's phone? Sir, we have a lead. Patch it up. Copy that, sir. We found this ID on the national database, sir. Are you sure about this? Positive, sir. Forward all the information to Agni. Yes, sir. Fazal. Yes, madam. The address is of Lucknow. They have booked some Amina's ticket to come here. Famous designer. She's coming to stitch Rohini's dress. But I know you're going to put a needle in her plans. Not me, the both of us. Come. Did you have a pleasant journey, Amina? I did, thanks to you. Sit. Thank you. Why hide your face from me? I am a fan of yours. How can I get a selfie with you this way? Yes. You see, I've made connections with some influential people... Unwittingly. I've seen your work. I liked it a lot. Thank you. Take my measurements. Fly. Fly. I've a thing for clothes, and you've earned quite the reputation. So I thought I should give it a try. Most of my connections are with sex workers. So I like a girl with a special talent. Thank you. I've turned into a feminist in the last couple of years. Yes. I've had no problems in being touched. In fact, I've always gained from it. I've always dreamt about this. There's a bonfire. Its flames almost engulfing the pitch black night. Touching the sky as if they'll burn it down. Then? Drunk women are circling around and celebrating. And then men dressed in whites are jumping into the fire. Then I wake up, because none of the f***ing men are left. - Water. - Water? Balram. Balram. Balram. Why you... I'll get it myself. Let's go. Here you go. I am sorry. I've taken your measurements, and the dress will be ready soon. - It was so nice meeting you. - Goodbye. It was nice talking to you. You don't speak much. Quite the shy kind. What were you doing? What the hell were you doing? There were so many buttons, madam, I got confused. You could've compromised the whole mission. Not possible, madam. You were there. You would've sprung into action. Madam... think again. Victim card! Take this and... Sorry, madam. Hi. Where's Papa? He's out for some work. He'll be back in a while. Will you play with me until Papa comes back? You're so tall. So sit over here. Come on. My mom used to play like this with me too. Now get up. Turn around in circles. Ready? - Steady? - Yes. You smart girl! Where are you? The laughter's coming from this way. Got you. Zaira. Papa. Papa. Where are you? Got you. Got you. Who is it? Who is it? Zaira. Zaira. Zaira! What happened? Nothing. I played so much with you. I'm tired. Now, get some rest. Sing me a lullaby. Or else I can't sleep. I know only one lullaby, but... Doesn't matter. Sing what you know. "Sleep, little princess..." "Sleep..." "Sleep, little princess..." "Sleep..." "Let sleep take over your eyes" "Wander off to the world of dreams" "Sleep, little princess." "Sleep, little princess." "Sleep..." A fortune spent on makeup, a couple of thousands on devices. But not a single clip worth the effort. It was a total waste, madam. Oh... So madam's going back to where it all began. It'll be a lot more fun if it all ends there. Soon... By the grace of Allah. Agni, you're following orders properly for the first time. Are you surprised? There's good progress as well. Not bad. This place looks more hi-tech than our resources. What's the status on Amina? See for yourself. Amina's dress is going to work wonders. These are Rohini's program details. The meeting's been fixed at Sheikh Haroon Al Abadi's new club, which Rohini will attend wearing the dress stitched by Amina. Butter Factory. Our agents are inside a van in the parking. They can hear and see everything, with your help. We've a link, sir. Visual's up. Sound's good to go. For you. The one who calls himself a hawk, is hiding like a rat in a hole. And has sent his pet Pussycat to handle things. Would you like a drink? Our sources in the government tell us, that some foreign agency attacked your warehouse. Maybe an Indian agency. The Sheikh is quite furious about it. It's not just the loss. But also because he can see the sun setting on your empire. That's why he has no desire in working... Before you form any firm wrong notions about me, can I give some clarification? You see, even we're worried about the loss. But we won't let you suffer. We've made up for it. As we speak, a second consignment Has already been delivered to you. You can confirm with your connections. And as for the sun setting on our empire... We shine like the moon and the stars in the dark. Some days might not be ours, but we own all the nights. Your claim was correct. I'm not used to changing my decisions. But it would be unfair not to do so now. Start gathering my 'roses'. The money will be transferred to your account. Thank you. One more thing, Sheikh. Rats aren't the only creatures that live in holes... Serpents do too. And this particular serpent is hungry for business. This can benefit both of us equally. I feel... you are a very intelligent man. Goodbye. Their network is expanding. They've become very organised. It's time to crush this serpent's hood. Rohini and Sheikh are talking about some hole. Rudraveer is hiding in the coal mines, that's why he's untraceable. I'm eager to end Rudraveer's story. But we can't attack the mines based on assumption. We need confirmed intelligence. Leave that to me. 'Only small roses.' Make no mistake this time, or I'll set your ass on fire. Hang up and get to work. "Don't lift my palanquin" "for my father is yet to bid me goodbye." "Don't lift my palanquin" "for my father is yet to bid me goodbye." "My brothers are still crying" "No one's consoled them as yet" "My brothers are still crying: "No one's consoled them as yet" "Don't lift my palanquin" "for my father is yet to bid me goodbye." "My brothers are still crying" "No one's consoled them as yet" "Father, I still have some dolls lying in your cupboard" "Father, I still have some dolls lying in your cupboard" "Father, I still have some dolls lying in your cupboard" "Today, I feel like you have fulfilled all my desires" "Today, I feel like you have fulfilled all my desires" Get the girls and be quick about it!! Come quick. "Don't lift my palanquin yet" "For my father..." You.. move!! Don't be dramatic, walk straight!! This is for you. This is the information you asked for. Thank you, sir. "Don't lift my palanquin" "Please, don't..." "For my father..." The Sheikh's man likes little roses. We will leave for Europe tomorrow. My boys moved earth and sky to complete your order. Everyone should be rewarded properly. And they will be. I never take any service for free. Goodbye. Madam, remember Birju from the bus stop. He's saying that Rohini is taking dozens of girls from the brothel to the mines. For some kind of celebration. Celebration? Madam, why don't you gather evidence, and arrest him on another day. I don't have time to rest. I've to finish this job quickly and leave. But madam, entering the coal mines is suicidal. We'll get shot. You take Zaira and leave. Madam, how can I leave? I was in jail. I was told that they will release me if I work for the agency. I can live with Zaira. And if I refuse, I'll rot in jail again. And Zaira will be sent to some orphanage... Zaira will be fine. You leave. I'll deal with the agency. You mean I can leave. Really? Swear on God. Where is Zaira? I've to wish her goodbye. Madam, you really are amazing. Zaira, what happened? Did you see a nightmare? Agni, Papa says you're very strong. Are you scared of anything? Yes... I'm very scared of the dark. Of the dark? How can you be afraid of the dark? You aren't? Sometimes, Papa comes home late, and there's a power cut. And I've to stay in the dark alone. But I was never scared. Brave girl. So what are you scared of? I'm afraid that someday Papa will leave me too, just like my mother left me. And I'll be all alone. Your father will never leave you. Promise. When did this beauty arrive? Freshly arrived from Lucknow! Haul them in the truck. Everyday you do the stripping... Give me a chance today. The order's almost complete. Sheikh Alabadi shouldn't lose faith in us. There shouldn't be any problems, understood. There won't be. No one will file any missing complaints about the children either. You have my word. Festivities are done. Now let's talk to the Sheikh. You! Hurry up and tell me. One of your girls is missing. She was in the wrong place. This shouldn't have happened. But it did. Someone will have to pay the price, isn't it? I don't know... Quiet. Absolutely quiet. Quiet! You see, it's Rani's fault. And the pawns are dying unnecessarily. Someone infiltrated your fortress. Birju. What did you say? Birju was spying on you. Birju. Let's spy on Birju. The guy Birju was passing the information to, is some post office warehouse manager. Fazal. Okay. I'll be there. Brother... What are you doing? She's just a kid. Doesn't matter. What is your name? Zaira. Madam, you're definitely mistaken. I don't know anything. What can I tell you? It's alright. Your Papa's hiding many secrets. Once he spills them, he'll feel better. Right, Papa? I swear to God, I don't know anything. Now Papa's being childish. Madam, no. Who are you collecting information for? And for what? I swear to God, I don't know anything. I don't know. Listen, your father is very brave. Let's see if I can scare him. No, no. She's my child. She's my child. Let my child go! Let my child go! I found your target. I saw him. It was him. How sure are you about him? Not everything can be seen by the naked eye. It was him! I don't want to be embarrassed like last time in front of the ministry. You might have to beg again. You're leaving him alive. Your call. So my job ends here. Am I free to go? It's a go-ahead on Operation Krait. I am calling in the assault team. You will lead the extraction. Sir. So you must be feeling lighter now. You know what, you ask her. Ask... "Papa, are you alright?" Ask... Ask... Papa... Papa... Are you alright? Are you alright? Yes, I am alright. I'm alright, my child. He was lying. He wasn't alright. That's why I put his lights out. You know what, child. Wish him goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Sweet dreams! Our lands. Our mines. The coal belonged to our forefathers. Our lands. Our mines. The coal too, belonged to our forefathers. Our forefathers had a rule. If some animal enters your cave, and tries to steal your food, then devour him. Humans decide nothing. Hunger decides. Law or religion don't matter... Hunger is the only religion. And those who tried to keep us hungry, I satiated my hunger with their blood. Pratap here knows. Since childhood, we walked together. Gave nothing that was mine, did no favours for others. And what I used to be once... You are that today. Our forefathers are buried here. And so are the animals they hunted. This coal is made from the bones of our ancestors, It doesn't belong to any government or master. And whoever tries to take this from us, will turn into coal dust. What will they turn into? Coal dust! So let's turn them into... Coal dust! Coal dust! Coal dust! Well done. We won't stretch it too much. We'll terminate the target, and quick in and out. Maximum 45 minutes. What about his men? We're relying on the element of surprise. Our target is only Rudraveer. What if they fire at us? The rules are clear. We'll fire back if we have to. Our priority is Rudraveer. Roger that! Comms check. Comms are good. Five minutes to incursion. Roger that. It's ours! It's ours! This coal! It's ours! It's ours! This coal! It's ours! What just happened? We just lost the visual, sir. Wait, wait, wait... Don't get excited. Something must be wrong. Get me eyes from another source. Agni, I cannot see your position. Don't worry, we're on track. What happened? Agni, can you hear me? I repeat, can you hear me? Agni, can you hear me? Agni, come in. Krait to base. Krait to base, come in. Agents down! Requesting air support. Krait to base, come in! Krait to base, come in! Abort mission. Abort mission, Agni. Agni, abort mission immediately! How did they know? Find their ammunition depot and blow it up. Move! Abort! Move towards the extraction point. I'll give you cover fire. Find it. I'm out of bullets. How many bullets do you have left? Want to enter the lion's den? Listen! Dead. Do you know the way out? Stop. Nobody will bloody shoot! You found the others, didn't you? This whore is mine. I don't sell my body... Separating the soul from the body is my business! "Sleep my princess" "Go to sleep" "Sleep my princess" "Go to sleep" "Go to sleep" "Sleep, little princess" "Go to sleep" "Sleep, little princess" "Go to sleep" Our information was correct. He was there. He knew we were coming, and we walked into a trap. Then your information was incomplete. A simple in-and-out extraction on an officer's gut feeling. And what happened? 18 of our men died. Your ops head Agni is dead, and we found no proof of Rudraveer being in those mines. Even if he was, you've alerted him now. We appreciate your intel on Porbunder port. We were able to rescue the kids. But nothing tied to Rudraveer. We're immediately disbanding your unit. You will stand down and wait for further instructions. Found her at the crime scene. Next to the dead body of her parents. She was singing this lullaby. - "Sleep my princess" - Perhaps to comfort herself. "Sleep" You think she can identify the killer? In my experience, in cases like these, children erase every memory of those terrible events. But when they grow up, these memories can resurface in a stressful situation or a triggering event We call it 'repressed memories'. They can come back. She isn't trying to forget, She's trying to remember something. Her face isn't calm because she's erased those memories. It's the glow from the fire of revenge burning inside. If she isn't taught how to control this fire, then anyone who comes in contact with her will be charred. I'll raise her as my own. 'Agni' means fire, so that's what we'll call you. The fire Agni started has spread all the way to Delhi. The police are raiding every brothel, every warehouse. Several of our boys have been arrested. You must leave tonight. I'll need some time to transfer my money. I'll join you as soon as it's done. If a king leaves his kingdom, that's not the end of his reign. You ruled this place, still do, and always will. How is she still alive after being shot in the heart? Destrocardia. It's a rare medical condition. In these cases, their heart is slightly on the right. Just like her mind, even her heart's slightly off-kilter. She's a survivor. Growing up means you can take care of yourself. But Papa, I don't want to grow up. Everyone has to choose their own path in life. People can walk with you, but they can't walk for you. Caught you. Caught you. Don't hide, Agni. I am coming. Who is it? You knew. Rudraveer killed my parents. If I had told you everything, then your emotions would've interfered with your duty. Why didn't you tell me? I was trying to protect you. I knew that... Knowing the truth would drive you crazy. Not that things turned out to be any better, but at least you survived. And only that is important for me. What do you think? Why did I give you this assignment? He should have died by your hands. For the department records and the world, you are dead. Killed in Action. I am sorry. We found Fasal's dead body, and Zaira is missing. Those two... They used to work for me, for the agency. That's why Rudraveer... It's no use living in the past, my child. There's nothing there. "Tell me..." "Why do you give up?" "Why are you helpless?" "Why do shadows loom over your eyes" "What's that storm brewing" "Why is your heart restless?" Wait. Wait. Wait. Why is your tracker suddenly sending movement and alerts? Where is your bracelet? Zaira? "You..." "Yeah, you..." "Believe in yourself" "Heal your wounds" "Call out now" "The path's not easy" "Who are you waiting for?" "You're breathing fire, Watch those sparks fly" "Watch those sparks fly" "Burn slow like embers" "The path's not easy" "But you're ready" "You're a Badass" "Hear this call" "Strike now" "You're a Badass, You're a wonder" "Hear this call" "It's time to strike" You're a Badass "It's time to strike" "You are ready" I'm uploading his location coordinates. Bring Zaira back safely. I had time that day, today I'm in a rush. Yes. It's do or die today. We met by destiny. We'll meet again if we're destined to. Only the weak use destiny as an excuse. Quietly come over. Come here fast, I'm thirsty. And listen... I've arranged a surprise for you. See you. Where is Zaira? Let's properly introduce ourselves today, Amina. With full details. Where's Zaira? What did you do with her? This? Is this why you're angry? I liked her so I kept her. It's an old habit of mine. The place where she is isn't any good for her. I didn't do the right thing keeping her. I already deduced that. Where is Zaira? How does it matter where she is? If she survives, she will become a shameless whore like me, or a brutal murderer like you. I'm not proud of what I've become. And it doesn't seem you regret what you've become. My childhood was taken from me, Zaira doesn't have to meet the same fate. Where is Zaira? "Sleep, my princess" "Sleep." "Sleep, my princess" "Sleep" "Let slumber take over" "Wander off to the world of dreams" "Sleep, my princess" "Sleep, my princess." "Let slumber take over" "Wander off to the world of dreams" Who started it? A brutal murderer with feelings. I've tears in my eyes! I'm so deeply moved. Sit. Sit, let's talk. What do you think will happen next? I'll tell you her whereabouts, and you'll spare my life. And then I'll be indebted to you for life. Nice. Very nice. I was a couple of years older than Zaira, when I had my first customer. I haven't forgotten that pain yet. I couldn't walk for many days. But that pain made me grow stronger. The same will happen with Zaira. While servicing customers... Where is Zaira? Where is Zaira? Where is Zaira? You came to take my measurements, didn't you? I guess you didn't do a good job back then. Today I'll give you my complete measurements. One last thing. Shove this up your arse. Why keep it a surprise? This time I won't blindfold your eyes. "Sleep, my princess" "Sleep" "Sleep, my princess" "Sleep" Hello. Zaira... Zaira. Zaira. Come, sing a lullaby and tuck her in. Or else I'll put her to sleep in my way. I couldn't save Zaira. I failed her. Rudraveer won't kill her, until you don't go looking for her. How will I find her without a tracker? It's impossible. It is possible. Sheikh Haroon Al Abadi. I've intel from my sources. Rudra was last seen with the Sheikh. But he won't open his mouth. And you'll need a new passport and identity to get in. And officially or unofficially, we won't give you any support. They shouldn't find any link to us. Whatever needs to be done, you need to do it alone. I'll find Rudraveer's location, even if I have to crack his Jaws open for it, or his head! It's not easy, what you had to do. Takes courage and will to live with your choices. Sorry about Seagull... No, he was my best agent. And I know he wouldn't have preferred any other way. I owe you for Seagull. The sheikh is holding a private party, and I've managed a way in for you. All the details are on this. This is where we part ways. Good luck, Dragonfly. Thank you. "Beauty's a many-splendored thing" "Its allure carries a lethal sting" "Tread carefully, sweetie" "You might have to pay dearly" "For your philandering."

"Your existence could be erased" "Without a trace" Rudraveer, where is he? I want Zaira. Where is he? Time for you to sing again. Please! Please! Where is Rudraveer? I don't know where he is. Please! Let me go, he will find you. He always does. That lullaby, you sing it well. Sing. "Sleep, my princess" Sing in tune. "Sleep, my princess" "Sleep, my princess" "Go to sleep" "Sleep, my princess" "Go to sleep" "Sleep, my princess" "Go to sleep" You want to meet Agni? This will unite you with her. Zaira. Listen, princess. You're alive as long as you're running. You stop, life stops. And you got to run not walk. So run, princess. Run. Zaira. Now, that one last thing... Remember what I taught you. Agni, save me. You put an end to all my old businesses. I thought why don't I reignite an old passion. An army of children, trafficking of children, using children as a shield. Try doing something grown-up. I spared a child's life once. Was it a mistake? Time to correct that mistake. That's the problem with you... You think you're some kind of messiah. In fact, you crawled out of the same sewer that I did. Come on. We're mere puppets, the strings are still being pulled by the one above. I'll have to knock this into your head. And maybe I'll have to crack your head open to do so. Rudraveer. I will find Zaira. If you want me to crack your skull open, then come on. This time, he's pulling the strings... because one of us is of no use to him anymore. Come on! Why did you kill my parents? Tell me, whose puppet are you? Your strings will be pulled too. Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Multiple internal injuries... Apart from what you can see on her. But she'll be okay, right? Of course. She's as tough as they come. She just needs to rest for a few weeks. I'll administer a sedative. That will help her sleep and heal more quickly. Thank you doctor for your time and discretion. Any time. - Hello. - Hi. Zaira. - Agni. - Zaira. Zaira. Let Agni rest now. She will get better sooner. Get well soon, Agni. I've learned a new game. I'll teach it to you too. Yes. Go. Go and play. Bye. Take rest. You need to recover first. Then we'll dissect everything later. Don't worry about Zaira, I'll take care of her. I was thinking about, taking Zaira to a psychiatrist. Anyway, you take care. Ok. We should be thankful to God, Agni. After all, he pulls all the strings. See you. See you in India. After all, he pulls all the strings. We're mere puppets, the strings are still being pulled by the one above. Maybe they have got a mole in the Russian FSB, or maybe between us. It was an ambush. The operational details will only remain between you and me. How did they find out? Why do you think I gave you this assignment? He should've died by your hands. I was told if I work for the agency, they will let me go. I can stay with Zaira. It's time to crush the serpent's hood. And if I refuse... Their network is expanding. They are getting better organised. In fact, you crawled out of the same sewer that I did. I'm eager to end Rudraveer's story. I'll have to knock this into your head. Just like I did my duty in raising you, Agni, you must do your duty. You must do any task I give you, without giving it a thought. I knew my daughter will find out my truth. Sit. Please, sit. Why did you kill them? Years ago, one night, you looked at me, with your little eyes like a child looks at his parents. At that moment I thought I can be the nice guy, that reflects in your eyes. And I tried. Like this? By using me? I tried Agni, I really tried hard. But then, this bloody past... It always... Always catches up with you. Why did you kill them? After you grew a little older, they wanted to quit the agency, and lead a normal life. I was scared. They knew too much. Too much. I wasn't sure whether they can protect themselves outside the agency. I was scared... I was afraid that due to some greed or threat, they will reveal all the secrets. And that's why I told Rudraveer to...
