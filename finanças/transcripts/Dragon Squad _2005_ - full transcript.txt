Injury retirement, but still on salary I'm gonna join him in retirement in just five days The local boss... of an international Triad organization, Panther Duen was abducted en route to a court appearance... Listen to the news! A cop should be more polite You should at least call me Uncle My name's Kong Long I'm your senior, but you can just call me 'Long' Please turn up the radio, Long The news is over The HK Police had multiple casualties and you don't care about it? Colleagues die Others will take their place Who'd be left to patrol if everyone went out for revenge? Who'd arrange your meals if I went off like that? Do your part, or the world falls apart I agree There's a pub near your place, open 24 hours Call me anytime, no problem Sister Morning Brother What are you doing here? It's a big case, gotta go back I brought you something Have you checked who they are? I've told you many times Do your best Come and eat Don't worry about me Been here a long time.

Give me one minute, and I'll show you Stay on target... No money, no play You're a sharpshooter Somebody's waiting for you Let me cover you Can I try? A lefty sharpshooter, indeed I admire you You're great! Okay This is marksmanship I learned to shoot on the move I'm not used to standing still Please, give me a chance Let me borrow the gun I’ll shoot the rest Thanks This is what a sniper does You and me... we make a good team A team? Why not? They're well organized obviously not just some local Triads They use military tactics I'm pretty sure the sniper’s a woman I hacked into HK Police records Apart from the sniper's weapon, their guns are police-issue One officer was stabbed with a knife, close quarters One slash, straightforward How could Tiger assemble such a powerful group? Guys, I don’t think... The target’s not coming out unless we take action I know what you're thinking Let's hit Tiger's place, and take a look This is it You know how much they earn, just from this street? Drugs, gambling, prostitution... Visible and invisible, on the streets, and underground $10 million a day They've changed their working hours Packing up so early? Let me ask you, Wouldn't they still want to make money? Unless their boss was in trouble Which means Panther wasn't rescued, but captured Long Who do you think did it? This is a great location Somebody wanted to rent it We'll close the deal in two days’ time Make a decision, or I can't help you anymore Yuet, Sarge Open his eyes Ko...? My brother will give your money back! Let me go... I’ve never owed anyone And I don't like it... Being owed something I'll give everything back Please, let me go... Let me introduce my new friend This is Petros Dominic's older bother No, it was an accident I didn't mean to... No! I didn't kill him! It's okay Dominic was a wild one He spent his whole life trying to get himself killed Yeah Everything’s negotiable, except the truth And every lie has a price Do it I want to see Tiger Duen What do you want with the Boss? It's Panther's ear! Nobody move! Tell Tiger his old buddy came by He’ll know what I want Ching Tiger? Send me a text. I gotta work Got it How're you doing? I'm fine, don't worry I've just been busy lately I'll come see you soon Okay Be careful Some colleagues say Long walks his dog here every day That Long... he’s such an odd character I'm afraid he won't help us Don't worry Women are better at asking for help I'll handle it I wanna know something about you HK cops About what? For example, do you need permission before you date a colleague? And, have you ever fallen in love with a partner during a case? I did worse than that I fell in love with my target when I was undercover Can you believe that? Thank you, come again Pretty girl? He's still young at heart What's the matter, Sir? Where's your boss? Hasn't come? Don't you know me? Kong, Sir Need some help? It's fine Everyone has hard times I'll help you now, then you can help me later What're you doing here? Village boy!

You just care about your colleagues! Go find them, then Why come to me? I know I was wrong Can't you give me one more chance? I don’t need your help Not now, and not in the future! I don't want a father like you! I'll do what I promised Based on their actions, they're special agents. I’m sure of it They break the rules They’re hard to deal with You won't find them using normal methods They're probably hiding in the city, acting as normal citizens, and planning their next move Panther’s a deputy He’s got no real power I don't think he's the target It's his brother, Tiger Duen So, if we get to Tiger Duen we'll find the agents, too He has four trained bodyguards with him They're known as the Power 4 You’ve gotta put them under surveillance Look Kong Long Ko You're still fast Faster every day I knew you'd come looking for me You know why? My face still burns So, how’s your old friend? Sharp as ever He's not alone this time Anything to drink? No Sorry You've never known what it’s like to be hungry I've seen men killed for less than this They're just kids Target practice for your team But Tiger’s been playing this game for a long time He won't show his hand unless we force him to What's our strategy, Colonel? There's an old Chinese saying: Don’t cry until you see the coffin My team will handle Tiger And I'll find the girl Excuse me Do you speak English? Yes Good. Can you direct me toward Hollywood road?

Four cops died My dad was one of them 13 years later, their sons and daughters became friends Three of them became cops I was one of them Do you know how we feel when people talk about their fathers? We feel so proud We're proud of them Kong, Sir We need you to take on the agents Let me give you some advice You can't beat them That's why we need a leader like you I was lost once, and it was hard to find myself again I don't want to take the wrong past again If you insist do it yourselves I hope you all make it back safely Kong Long, we can do it without you! Please, make yourself at home Would you like a drink? Yes, thank you Tell me, where are you from?

Yes, I wanted to give you something You were so nice the other night Do you like them? They're beautiful Allow me Now, you can go to the ball What? Like Cinderella Are you all right? Whenever I’m happy, I get scared I know I'll be sad again soon Do you know why the little angel doesn't have a mouth? Because she likes to keep secrets? You’ll find a smile on her face when you’re happy, and a sad face when you're upset She can share your feelings There's some business I need to take care of Would you like to come with me? Sure Okay. A little female charm is good for business Sir...

One of you died So did my old friend Read them all within 10 minutes The Duen brothers have been running guns and drugs for years All the firearms and drug dealers have bank account numbers and passwords They’re all stored somewhere No mark, no trace Their underground capital exceeds $2 billion All the numbers are on film It’s their most valuable asset, and the agents' prime target Nobody ever knew where Tiger hid it, but they forced his hand If Tiger runs, he’ll take the film with him He can’t be seen in public now, so he’ll have someone take it for him I know who she is If you don't act today, you'll never get another chance Will you come help me catch them? Stay, or go! Come on We go together, and come back together! Yes, Sir!

Get him! Go! Move, get out of the way! Police! This was my first mission I've already shot the whole process Human memories are complicated As time passes... you can deceive yourself I used to believe that what I recorded was reality Until the night I returned to that pub, and sat where Petros once sat I saw her again She looked so different, I suddenly realized that what I recorded... wasn’t so real, after all Only when there’s faith does it finally become the truth
