What happened to your teddy bear? This? Well, my dad bought this bear when I was three. Not that I remember, that's just what my mom said. He bought it at a rest area when we were going on a trip. I've always... Father bought this but that's not the reason I've kept this bear. Stuffed animals are hard to throw in the trash, right? They have eyes! Does she have a name? Yes. Ku. That's all. She has a cute face, right? The school... Where are you? Where are you? Yamada? I'm the engineer on the express train There are pretty girls at every station But when you only stop for three minutes There's not enough time to kiss them Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka Hey. Yes? You know the commercial with Riho Makise in the sea? Yes. Apparently there's a woman's face in the water. For real? For real. It's the ghost of a drowned woman. What? For real? Scary, right? Yes! Apparently you can see it if you pause the video. No way! It's true. No way! Have you seen it, Takahashi? What, me? Yes. I think I saw it. For real? Yes. That's terrifying. It is, right? Yes! Wakakusa. Yes? Can't you smell the sea? There's a river in our town. It's near the mouth of the river, and the water spreads out and stagnates. It smells bad. Canada goldenrod grows near the river, and you will often see dead cats around the area. NO TRESPASSING Pochi! Where are you? Time to go home. Pochi! Pochi! Been playing? Oh, you have something. Did you find something good? What did you find? What did you find? Right. Come on, Pochi. Time to go. Okay, Pochi! Okay. Let's go home. Rumi! That's Lancôme Définicils! Yes. I got a guy to buy it for me. I wish my boyfriend was 38! Ask Takahashi to buy you one. Like that'll happen! Yoshie! Haruna! Was it all right yesterday? Ugo Ugo Ruga already ended when I got home. My mom was so mad at me. Oh, there's Kannonzaki. What? Morning! I wonder how Kannonzaki and Haruna are doing at the moment. Don't ask me. She keeps things to herself too much. She didn't even say they were together. Even though he's hot! I can't stand Kannonzaki. Haruna has no taste in guys. You asshole! It hurts. Yamada and the locker! What is it? You're awful! What? How did you know? Yoshie told me. Takahashi? It was terrible! Pitch black, freezing cold... You went to help him? Of course, I did! Do something like that again and I'll kill you! What? Is there something between you and Yamada? Don't be stupid! It's Kanna Tajima. Maybe she's looking for Yamada. He's not here yet! Hey. Morning. Morning. Maybe the rumors aren't true. What? That Yamada's gay. Someone saw him in Shinjuku, holding hands with a boy. And I heard he's with the freshman, Kozue Yoshikawa. You mean that model girl? Apparently they went to the bushes by the river together. I bet you heard that from Takahashi. Nothing he says is true. Hey, that's mean! Stop it! Come to my place today. Nobody's home. In your dreams, dumb-ass! Eat as much as you like. You too, Punna. Morning, Maru! You must be sleepy. What's the matter? You have beautiful eyes, don't you? Of the civil liberties, there is freedom of conscience, freedom of the body, and economic freedom. Freedom of conscience means the freedom to think and speak as you like. Religious beliefs, gatherings of people, means of expression, learning and the likes are not to be restricted by the state, and individual freedom must be protected. This principle is based on the state's control of Shinto before the war, and its continuance is deeply cared about. Now, freedom of expression... Don't mess with me. It means the right to give your opinion to others... Please tell us your name. I'm Kannonzaki. Nice to meet you. How big is your family? There's my dad, my mom, my big bro, and me. My close family. Your close family? My dad and mom aren't together. I guess you could say they don't care about each other. She found out that he was cheating, it's the same old story. My mom got into dancing, she did nothing else all week. My dad and a woman from his office... I say "woman", but she's about 45, she's practically a granny. They ran away together around fall last year, but they came back after about a week in the end. Things are normal now. We all act as if nothing happened. Does your girlfriend know about your family? No, I haven't talked to her about it. Why not? I don't think she'd be interested in stuff like that, and she only has her mom around, so she might just envy me for having two parents. How did you two start seeing each other? I guess it just felt right. She gets really mad sometimes, but she doesn't get too suspicious, so she's easy to be with. Keep your mouth shut! Strip. Strip what? I told you to strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Haruna's skipping class! I have a headache. I'm starving. I bet you want that gross udon again. It's my favorite now! No way! It's a paper blizzard! Wow! It's amazing! ICHIRO YAMADA Freaky! You saw it? I think so. For real? Hey! Where's Kannonzaki? He said he's skipping this afternoon. Where's Yamada? I don't know. You're lying! What's this? That guy's crazy. We were just messing around. What do you mean? Do something. It's something only a girlfriend can say. Where's Yamada? The old chemistry lab. NO TRESPASSING Yamada! It's okay. It's Wakakusa. I brought your clothes. Where are you? Over here. Sorry, it happened again. That's okay. Wakakusa. Yes? Are you free tonight? Yes. I'll tell you about my secret treasure. What? I want you to see it. The rate of the ozone layer depletion went from 5% to 10% in the last 17 years. The amount of fluorocarbon released by humans into the atmosphere is 15 million tons. About 10% of this, 1.5 million tons, reaches the stratosphere, destroying the ozone layer. MOM, I'M MEETING UP WITH A FRIEND, THERE'S CURRY IN THE POT, HARUNA Sorry! It was my turn to cook dinner. What were you like as a child? When I was in elementary school, I always go to the library. I loved books about UFOs. I've always wanted to see one. I've been bullied since elementary school. One day, I got beaten up badly. My whole body was black and blue, and I couldn't let my parents find out. Having your parents find out is the worst. So... I didn't want to go home. I looked up at the sky from the roof of the apartment block till it got dark. I kept wishing for a UFO to appear. I think I was up there for a few hours. I still feel a strong desire to see one from time to time. It doesn't have to be a UFO. I guess... I want to see something totally different from the reality to appear. Hello, Koyama residence. Phone for you. Some boy named Kannonzaki. Okay. No more long calls. Mom said you're costing her... Okay. What is it? What? That was so cruel. Everyone hates me. That's not true. I bet some of the girls like you. They think you're cute or mysterious... I'm nothing nice like that. I want to gut the people who treat me like a worm, turn their skin inside out, salt it, and feed it to dogs. I want to put trash into the mouths of the girls who watch and laugh. That's all I ever think about. I'm a homosexual. You can call me gay, faggot, pervert, or whatever. But aren't you seeing Tajima from Class B? That's just an act. Does Tajima know that? No. It's not fair for her, really. You're the first normal person I've ever spoken to, Wakakusa. Is it really all right? It's okay. My mom's at dance class, and my dad's on a business trip. Plus I'll be pissed if we can't do it today. So selfish. Says the girl who came after one phone call. Hurry up and get it out. You're kidding, a snake? No, it's not... It's somewhere around here. What? Here it is. What? Do you do this kind of thing with Haruna, too? Shut up. It's none of your business. I found it last year. I'd been beaten up like I was today. It's embarrassing, so I came here to cry. Then I saw this. Did you tell the police? I really should, but... Around fall last year, there was still flesh on the bone. There we go. I... don't know if I'm dead or alive... but looking at it gives me courage. No, I'll die... I'll die... Another person knows about this. Who? Kozue Yoshikawa. The freshman? When I came at the end of last year, she was already here. Since then, we sometimes come together. It's her treasure, too. How long have you been doing this kind of work? Maybe since I was about three. I wasn't a model at the start, I was more like a child actor. I did things like dramas and TV commercials. My parents are in that line of work, so they asked if I wanted to try doing it. But as for the work itself, everyone comes together to make one thing which I think is great. When you do magazine work, you work with photographers and all kinds of people. And there are more brilliant people when you do TV work. But you'll get a sense that it doesn't have to be you right there. Anyone could do it. You think that anyone could do it? I think I look gross when I see a magazine or something I'm in. I wonder why they keep using me with an ugly face, yet compliment me. But I don't believe them. I'm sure the truth is that they don't really mean it, and they're just saying what they think they have to say. Like they're pleased with themselves for calling an ugly person beautiful. How is school? Do you enjoy it? Compared to work, school feels genuine. Genuine? I don't know if the people at school call things as they are, but I'm sure that if they think something is ugly, they'll say it. They'll at least say it behind your back. You mean everyone is honest? Yes. How are you feeling, Yoshikawa? I'll go to my next class. That won't do. You need to have a balanced diet. Your health comes before work. Yes, Nurse. So older students skip class a lot, too. Do you have enough credits? I miss school for work a lot, so I only have just enough. Oh, look. The one who just threw the ball. Running towards the center. Yes! That's the guy Yamada likes. What? That boy... He is Yamada's other treasure. I wear my navy uniform I'm a Tokyo bus girl Hey. Yes? The old lady with makeup from the apartment near school... Yes? She dries her see-through, lace purple panties on the balcony. That old lady has taken the cherries of countless boys at our school. For real? Why don't you ask her? How old is she, though? Ask that after. Okay. Oh, something's biting! You idiot. Shit! You were saying? Right. You know the river behind the school? Yes? Well, there... Excuse me! Hey! Have you heard? The old man died, his money is buried, and we might... What are you talking about? So, anyway! There's a cabin in the bushes, near the river behind the school. An old man lived there, right? He was evicted and he moved to a different apartment, but he recently died. He was broke when he died, but he has a lot of money stashed away! Really? And guess what! The money is buried in the bushes! The bushes? Right! Ten million in the bushes! Isn't it amazing? One second, I just... Haruna! How much is it? 140 yen. Is Yoshikawa around? Yoshikawa? She was here earlier, but... She often disappears. What? Ten million! What can you do with that? Where's Haruna? She went off somewhere. Right. I can make my dreams come true! Ten million yen! Why did you bring me here? I'm mad at you. Why? Maybe I'll tell Haruna about everything. What? How you tied my hands and feet, blindfolded me, and stuck a can of mousse in both of my holes! You little... Hey! I'm only kidding. Hey... Shall we do it here? Do you want 100 million yen? Yes! Do you want to be filthy rich? Yes! What a bunch of idiots! All I said was that there might be money buried there. What? It's not true? My mom went to the old man's funeral, and she wondered if he might have buried it. What? What about the 150 million? Where did you get that from? Is that true, Takahashi? All right, let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Wait! It's not true! Hey! The money's a lie! It's a lie! It's a lie! Hey! It's not true! Hey! Haruna! Where are you going? Those little punks. Hey. Where are you going? Come on. Hey. I'll tell you about my secret treasure. Sorry. I thought this would really suit you. You seem like a blue kind of guy. I didn't get you anything for your birthday. We've only started dating in December, and your birthday's in March. Thank you. Do you want to go to the aquarium on Hakkeijima? I still haven't been there. Sure. I'll make us lunch. When shall we go? What about Sunday? Okay. What do you want for lunch? Sandwiches, rice balls, or bagels? Anything's fine. Shout if you find anything! Let's go! What are they doing? I'm not really sure, but everyone was saying something's buried... Yamada? Hey! Stop that! Yamada! Hey! Yamada! Get off! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Somebody! Somebody! Who the fuck are you? You piece of shit! Let's call it a day. We'll continue in the morning. Are you okay? Evening. Evening. This has gotten out of hand. Right. Let's go. He went out? Okay. Oh, my name's Tajima. No. Yamada got hurt, so I was worried. Yes. Goodbye. It's fine. You get that end. Wakakusa? Oh, yes. We won't be able to look at it anymore. We have no choice. I'd rather that than have them treat it like a toy. Ready, and lift. Let's dig as deep as we can. They'll find it if it's shallow. Right. Sorry... My arms and legs are aching. Timeout. I need to smoke. Give me one, Wakakusa. Hey... What were you thinking when you saw it? I'm not really sure. I thought... "It serves you right." "It serves you right." Yes, "It serves you right." People pretend to be beautiful, pretend to be nice, and pretend to have fun. It makes me sick. I may not have one myself, but you guys don't have a way out either. So it serves you right. That's what I thought. Let's bury it. Okay. Let's go. It's beautiful! I love fish! Oh, hey. Shall we go to Enoshima Aquarium sometime? They have loads of jellyfish! They're see-through and so pretty. They look like frilly dresses! Haruna... Oh, Kiteretsu! My first kiss! Wobbly, wobbly jelly! Isn't that Yoshikawa from our school? Wobbly, wobbly I bet she got some good money for that. Very nice. Wobbly, wobbly jelly! Things aren't that simple. A model only needs a nice body. It's not fair. It's delicious! Marry me! Yes. You're lucky, Kannonzaki. What? You don't seem to have a care in the world. Yes. Let's go after Kiteretsu is done. Seriously? You're not staying? I'm not. Sorry, I have plans later. Okay. See you tomorrow, then. The lunch was delicious. Thank you, I had fun. Scary. Hey, you there. Will you stop taking every carton of milk we have? What are you doing? Can't you knock first? Is this all that's left? I wanted to make pudding. Get out! Don't just come in here! I will, if you stop going into my room. I know you do that. If you touch my diary again, I'll get Mom to put a lock on the door. Oh, one more thing. Will you stop wearing my clothes without asking me? It stretches them. Yamada. What is it? I thought I'd give the cats some milk. Do you have class? I skipped it. Okay. They've grown. Yes. They looked like little mice when you first found them. Here. He's greedy. And again! To me! You like him, right? How did you know? Yoshikawa told me. Yes, I do. Don't you want to tell him you like him? I do. Or that you want him to hold you? Yes. To kiss you? Of course. And sex? I really want to. Do you take it or give it, Yamada? How do you decide when it's two men? Doesn't it hurt when it goes in? I guess you use lube like in the books? Do you prefer having your clitoris licked or fingered? What? Do you spit or swallow? It's rude to ask me about sex just because I'm gay. Sorry. No, it's okay. Rather than any of that stuff... just being with him would be enough. He's there. I'm there. And I can see him. That would be enough. Heard in the day Lull'd by the moonlight Have all passed away Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song List while I woo thee with soft melody Gone are the cares of life's busy throng Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me What is it? Come to my place today. What's with you? Do you have the stuff? No. I won't come, then. Don't say things like that. Isn't Haruna giving you any? What? Hey. My period's late. What will you do? How did you meet your 38-year-old boyfriend? A friend introduced us. A friend? Yes, someone I met at a club somewhere. What do you like about him? His money. Do your parents know about him? No, they don't! He's 38 and married, after all. There's no way I'd introduce him to them. My parents trust me. When are you conscious of your physical body? When I'm having sex. What does love mean to you? Love? MIYASHITA, CONDOM. NAKAMURA, CAME INSIDE. KANNONZAKI, CAME INSIDE. EISUKE, CONDOM. NOGUCHI, DON'T REMEMBER. SHIBUYA DUDE, CONDOM. IKEBUKURO CLUB DUDE, CAME INSIDE. YOSHIKAWA, CONDOM. Rumi! Get in the bath! Okay! Haruna, answer it! What? Answer the phone! Okay! Hello, Wakakusa residence. Hello? What happened? They hung up. Was it tasty? Yes. I'm glad! Can I make you something again? Yes. Don't worry, I like cooking. What do you like? Whatever. Hey, shall we take lunch to an aquarium again? Yes. I bought a CD earlier that I thought you'd like. I'll lend it to you! I also bought some blue wool. It's absolutely beautiful. I thought I'd knit you a sweater. I think blue suits you. Do you like blue? You could wear it and we could go on a date. Where shall we go? I'd like to go see Original Love live. They have a gig coming up at Shibuya Club Quattro. Hopefully, we can get tickets! And there's an interesting exhibition on at that art gallery in Omori. I'd love to go there together! Then there's... Shut up! Yamada? Do you enjoy talking about pointless crap? About things you want me to do? Do you love talking about nothing but yourself? I went to the bushes, but something was different. Though it's all quiet now. Has something happened? No, nothing. Okay. Wakakusa. Yes? Let's try calling a UFO. I've done it before, just once. How should I do it? Do it in your head. It's freezing! I know, right? Is my fringe weird? No, it's fine. Thanks. Rumi! Hi! Morning! Are you okay now? You were gone for three days, we were worried! This year's colds really drag on. I'm glad you're better. A letter! What? What? A love letter? Who's it from? Doesn't say. Open it! Who is it? I can't wait! YOU'RE BETTER OFF DEAD YOU'RE BETTER OFF DEAD How creepy. Forget about it! Haruna! Morning! Morning. Are you okay now, Koyama? Yes. Hey, Haruna. Do you think I should get a haircut? Or should I grow it out? I don't care. What should I do? Whatever! Which one? Move. Which? Enough already! Which is better? I don't care! You're skipping class. Period pain. Only kidding. Come here for a minute. I found something interesting. What? You'll see, come on! One second. It's fine. Hey! Yoshikawa! Wakakusa! This way! What is it? What? What is it? Over there. Here. Take a look. Isn't it crazy? I think it's a cat or something. It looks like meatballs! I'm sorry, Wakakusa. I didn't mean for this to happen. Hey. I'm sorry. Please don't cry. I'm sorry. Nice and loud! Three, four, five, six, seven, eight... What a beautiful color! Is it a present? Yamada likes blue. That's so nice! He doesn't shut up about wanting me to knit for him! That's so nice! I envy you! It's so cool that you can knit! You're really good! That will really suit him! Right! It's so cute! How lovely! What's this about? It's freezing. You'd fuck me if we were indoors. Or maybe you don't mind being outside? What does that mean? All you think about is sex. I asked if you had the stuff earlier, right? What are you talking about? Give me money. What? For the operation. How much? It's 150,000. What? There's no way it costs that much. Well, it does. Is it really mine? Why didn't you use protection? It wasn't just when we were high, you've never used at all! Even though you use one with Haruna! I don't have that kind of money. You said you'd get cash for the stuff. I've run out. But you still have money to buy Haruna a present? All right. But I can't give you all of it. Haruna doesn't like you at all. What do you mean? She told me. "I don't like Kannonzaki at all. He's a dumb-ass. He gets pissed when I don't let him fuck me." I don't like you at all, either. Shut your mouth. Even your parents don't care about you, right? They totally neglect you! Stop it. What can you do? You're nothing. Stop it. You're a piece of shit, bullying thief who fucks his girlfriend's friend! And who's the father of that brat? You're a piece of shit! Violence again! Because nobody likes you! Because nobody loves you! Stop it! Are your feelings hurt? What a dumb-ass! Stop it... Stop it... Stop it... Stop it... Stop it... Incredible. It's my mom's hobby. It looks like a love hotel. Are you hungry? Oh, yes. I've ordered some food. Sit down. Would you like some wine? Yes. I might be quitting school. Really? Yes. I'm going to be a regular on three TV shows. I worked hard in my freshman year, but sophomore might not be so good. I wanted to go to college. I won't be able to eat all this. Don't worry, I will. You're joking. It's fine. I'll throw it up after anyway. Would you like a coffee? Sure. Thanks. Do you hate me now, Wakakusa? Not at all. I like you, Wakakusa. We'll buy gloves in a convenience store. Don't tell anybody! Anybody! I'll kill you if you do. What will you do? Come on, let's go. It takes ages to bury someone. Oh, yes. I'll call two more people. What? We've dug together before, so it's perfect. Who? Wakakusa and Yoshikawa. What's going on with you and Haruna? Nothing. I have no sexual interest in girls. And you don't have to worry about being with me. I hate you. Okay. Okay. Okay, got it. What is it? It was Yamada. He said he found a new dead body! He wants us to go see it now before he buries it. What do you mean? NO TRESPASSING What are you doing? That's not yours to look at! Fuck you! You frustrated, ugly bitch! What have you been doing? You're such an idiot! A child you don't know who the father is? What will you do? "I got 50,000 just for having sex once." That's prostitution! It's none of your business! Shut up, you pig! Get out, you ugly bitch! Stop writing your gay manga! Try getting yourself a boyfriend! Lose some weight, fatty! You pig! Die! Die! Die! Hey! What's going on? You're being so loud... Haruna! Haruna! Where is it? It went off somewhere. What? It was here a minute ago. I see. That sucks. I'm sorry. That's not right. Koyama and I weren't like that. I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! Hello. Is Ichiro home? Okay, I see. Hello. Is Haruna there? Die. I'm sorry. Let's head off. Wakakusa. What's with you two? What kind of relationship is this? What kind... Surely not you and Yamada? I told you we're not! Then what? Don't make fun of me, Yamada! If only you weren't around... Stop it, Kannonzaki! You're the person I like more than anyone! I'm sorry I couldn't say that until now. I'm sorry! I won't leave you alone again! Haruna! Haruna! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Let's leave the idiot here. But what about Wakakusa? She'll be fine. It has nothing to do with her. So she'll be fine. This is Wakakusa's. From when we dug that hole. Haruna! Haruna... Haruna... How long have you been dating Yamada? Since December last year. I like Ozawa who used to be in Flipper's Guitar. I was listening to his first solo album in the Shibuya HMV, and Yamada was nearby, also listening to it. I knew who he was, but we were in different classes, but I thought he had such a beautiful face. There's something special about Yamada. He dresses so well, he has a sort of mysterious vibe, and he's just kind of different from the other rough boys. But I thought it would be a mistake to talk to him at school, so I thought I'd talk to him there. We went straight to a café on Spain-zaka together, and from there I started to lend him all kinds of CDs. Then, at Christmas, I plucked up the courage to ask him to be my boyfriend, and he just said "Okay"! I really couldn't believe that it had happened. I was so happy. And now you're happy, right? Yes, I am. Really happy. Well... Do you ever think to yourself you're happy to be alive? I'm happy to be alive. I'm happy to be alive. The snow that falls on top of Mount Fuji And the snow that falls On Ponto-Cho in Kyoto They're both the same snow, aren't they? Once they're thawed, everyone's the same Hey. Yes? Lots of crazy shit has happened at school lately, hasn't it? Sure has. You know, it's because in the Edo period, they used to execute people there. For real? And, it's been seen recently. What has? Kanna Tajima's ghost. That's not funny. That was crazy. I bet she was trying to set Wakakusa's apartment on fire. Then she caught fire! It's Yamada's fault. Yamada's crazy, isn't he? He is. Jeez. He scares me. Rumi had a baby. Yes. I didn't know she has a big sister either. Right. I don't think we could have done anything... But I wish she told us. Are you really moving? Yes. My mom said it's hard living in the apartment block. And my room was burned to a crisp. I see. Okay. Haruna! Shall we have a coffee break in a minute? Sure. We've got more luggage than I expected. I don't have much. It's because we threw the fire extinguisher out. I still hadn't paid off the turntable. What can you do? Yes! Hi! I came to help out. Okay. Hey. Hey. Do you have any attachment to the town? I'm not sure. What's happening to you and Kannonzaki? I don't think I'll ever see him again. I think he will be relieved once I'm gone. You're a lifesaver! Keep it up! You got it! Do you feel sad at all? What do you mean by "sad"? Like you've lost something precious to you. Well then I guess I'm not sad, I think. Do you feel like you're alive? If I had to say... I don't feel alive. What do you mean by that? Because I don't change. You don't change? Yes, like a stone... or plastic. I guess I'm like them because I don't change much. So what do you think it means to be alive? Feeling things, I think. Feeling the warmth of warm things, or the coldness of cold things... That's what I think it is. Recently... there was a day that a lot of stuff happened. Kanna Tajima died... and Rumi... lost her baby. I don't know if it's appropriate... to use the word "felt". But even though I never even knew that it existed... I felt like I'd lost someone for the first time in my life. But will you go on living life? I want to live my life. How will you live your life? Wounded. Forgetting. Remembering. Sometimes crying, sometimes getting angry... Sometimes smiling and laughing. I want to live my life feeling things. I want to live my life. I have school tomorrow so I won't be able to see you off. See you. Take care. See you. Goodnight. Wakakusa. Yamada. Here. Maybe you could take this with you. What is it? It has my favorite poem of William Gibson in it. William? William Gibson. Thank you. Shall we go for a little walk? Okay. What's up? Nothing. It was very sudden, wasn't it? Well... It's just an early spring break. "This city, in plague time, "This city, in plague time, knew our brief eternity. Knew our brief eternity. Our brief eternity, Our brief eternity, our love. Our love. Our love knew... Our love knew... the blank walls at street level. The blank walls at street level. Our love knew the frequency of silence. Our love knew the frequency of silence. Our love knew... Our love knew... the flat field. The flat field. We became field operators, We became field operators, we sought to decode the lattices. We sought to decode the lattices. To phase-shift to new alignments, To phase-shift to new alignments, to patrol the deep faults, to patrol the deep faults, to map the flow. To map the flow. Look at the leaves... Look at the leaves... how they circle in the dry fountain. How they circle in the dry fountain. How we survive in the flat field." How we survive in the flat field." Recently... Yes? I saw Tajima's ghost. What? Maybe it was my imagination. But I think I saw her at school. You think? To put it more accurately, I sensed, not saw her. Like she was just there, not doing anything. But it doesn't bother me. I like her more... when she's dead than when she's alive. But I wish I liked her more when she was still alive. Do you... not like people unless they're dead? That's not it. I like her. Is that right? Besides... you're alive, and I like you. I mean it. I'm going to miss you when you're gone. Wakakusa. Let's try calling a UFO one more time. Let's try again.
