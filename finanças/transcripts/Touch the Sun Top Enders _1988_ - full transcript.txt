You could be one too ya know. It's probably why you don't get along. 'Cause you can see in him tons of things you don't particularly like in yourself. (laughs) Good night darling. [Alice] We're alright aren't we mum? What do you mean? Have we got enough money? No I know we haven't. What I mean is we're not different are we? Well, not everyone's mum works in a casino. We're just people Alice. We're just normal people trying to get by the best way we can. But we do have one thing extra special. That's you and me, kid. That's what we got. Okay? Is that enough?

We're on our own ey? Don't do that please. You should be in bed darling. Alice. Do you know who I am? 'Course I do. You're my useless, no good father. Well you certainly told him. When's he going? I don't know. It's a free country I can't run him out of town. The police could. Get the police onto him. Alice! Why not? He's a criminal! He's not! He got into trouble a few years ago but he's paid for that. And he shouldn't be here! He shouldn't be allowed near us! You can get the cops to say he can't come near us. Only if he's a nuisance. Well he is. You divorced him years ago. I didn't. We only separated. You should get a divorce so he has to go away. He's your father Alice, he does have some rights. Now would you just calm down you're gettin' this whole thing right out of proportion. Why didn't you get a divorce? Maybe I didn't want to. Where do you think you're going? School. Alice! I have to duck out to the principal's office for a minute so I'm gonna leave you in charge alright? You know what to do. (rap dance music) (children cheering) Isn't he great? (music stops) I could hear this racket from the principal's office! Don't look at me. Sorry Miss. A nice demonstration Mick, but it might be better saved for the concert don't you think? I'd like to but I won't be here. I'm going back to the rodeo with my uncle.

It's not life for a kid. And she promised your mum you'd go to high school. But I hate school. I can't do any of that stuff. Kath's been talking to your teacher. She reckons you're a really great kid. And with a bit of extra hard work you can catch up. I don't want to catch up. I want to be a rodeo champion. You didn't go to high school. Yeah. And what sort of future have I got? What am I going to do when I get too old for it? Could do cattle mustering. They're using helicopters for that now. You could come with me during the holidays. Listen. I want you to do me a favour. Would you look after these for me? And when they get tarnished you give it a little polish. Hey what do you reckon mate? [Mick] I'm gonna meet my uncle Roy in Katherine. He reckons I'll bring him luck. [Boy] You won't be allowed. [Mick] Yeah? We'll see. Good morning Alice. You didn't tell me your father was a musician. Ah yeah. Well he seems like a very interesting man. Yeah he does seem like a very interesting man. Ah Mick. You are gonna be able to rap for us at the concert now aren't you? Mick's decided to stay in town. And we're very pleased to have you Mick. Stuck with you are we? Shut up. [Boy] Good luck charm, hey Mick? (country music) You wanna go for a walk on the beach?

All that stuff's over between us we're just mates. Is that all we are? Just mates? Don't do this to me Jack I've been okay for six years I don't wanna go through it all again. G'day sweetheart. Planning a holiday? School project. Kakadu National Park. Seems like a pretty nice place. Maybe the three of us could go there together someday ey? My project's gotta be in next week. Had a bit of a yawn to your teacher the other day. Oh? [Jack] Yeah. Well anyway she says you're smart as a whip. Should go a long way. Academically or the tops. What's that supposed to mean? Well what do you think it means? I don't know, you tell me. It means your manners are right down the hole. She said that. [Jack] No I said that. Huh. Ever since I've got back you've been behaving like a spoiled brat. Now I realize I haven't been exactly what you call the best of fathers. So I've been pretty tolerant about the whole thing. I don't believe this. Goodbye! Listen Alice. I just want us to have a go at being a proper family alright? No it's not alright. You think you can just come and go whenever you'd like and we'll be waiting for you. Well you're wrong. And you're not allowed to come here! This is my place! Don't you ever come here again! Now listen sweetie... You listen sweetie! Ah! Alice! Come back here! [Teacher] Thank you. Dan. Nicole. Anyone seen Mick Nichols today? He's sick Miss. Oh? Homework, Alice. Didn't do it. And why not? Didn't feel like it. I see. (muffled rock music) [Sue] What's this I hear about you giving Jack a hard time ey? [Alice] What's that racket? [Sue] Jack's just rehearsing some people for his band he put an ad in the newspaper. [Alice] You let him? How am I supposed to do my homework? Well he couldn't do it where he was staying. I told him just this once. Just this once, just this twice, then only three times a week, then he might as well just move in. You know what he's like. How am I gonna do my homework now? Hey come on. How could you? You said you'd never have him back after the last time. Took you years to parve the harpit just on his band stuff and now he's doing it again. And he'll keep on doing it as long as you let him. You're gonna take him back, aren't you. It's not that simple. Whether you like it or not Alice he's a part of our lives. Don't be so hard on everyone. Sometimes people make mistakes. [Alice] And sometimes they make the same mistakes twice. You know what your trouble is mum. You just let people walk all over you. And you know what your trouble is? You think you're the only person with feelings about anything! (loud rock music) Lets say we go to that pizza place for tea. I don't have to work 'til eight. Just the two of us. I rang Marta's (mumbles) early. She's gonna help me finish my project. I'll stay there tonight. Mm, okay. See ya later alligator. Yeah, see ya.

You didn't have to get out. Whatcha doin' here anyway? I'm meeting Roy in Katherine. Thought he dumped ya in Darwin. Who told ya that? Mai, she said you'd run away. Well she got it wrong, but I bet you did. Only for a few days. 'Til mum comes to her senses. Then I'll go back. Well, see ya. Where ya goin'? Down the road a bit. More chance hookin' you a ride if you're on your own. Tell you what, you'll get a longer ride if you're on a truck and seem grateful. And keep yacking. Helps 'em stay awake. See ya. But...

What are you doing up here anyway? Lookin' for you babe. Hasn't Alice given you the lecture on the dangers of gambling? That kid's got right out of hand. [Sue] She has not. She's a very bright, responsive, intelligent, affectionate young woman. She's too smart. Yes she is, and thanks very much but I'll deal with all that in my own sweet way. Just as I've dealt with every other problem concerning her for over six years. I'm terribly sorry sir, I'll have to ask you to leave. Oh I'm with... Dress rules prohibit the wearing of denim in the confines of the casino. [Jack] Yeah alright hands off the merchandise. How long's Mick been gone? Since yesterday but I'm real sure he's on way to Katherine. He was really upset when Roy didn't take him with him. Have you told the police? No way. They'd just lock him up. Put a message out on the yalunga radio but richest all the Aboriginal communities down there. They'll look out for him. Maybe she went with Mick? Why would she want to go to Katherine's? Nothing there. Why would she go with Mick, she can't stand him. She's not too keen on him anyway. Well you'd better call the police. No not yet. Why not? My family my problem. I don't want the law stickin' its nose in. Anyway I think I know where she is. See ya. [Kath] You stay in that bath Maurine, or else! I'll get the rodeo to put a message out for her, just in case. Thanks! [Kath] Maurine! G'day, too hot to be walkin' ey? Get in! (country music on radio) Lovely day isn't it. Have you driven far? Been on the road seven, eight hours. (horn blares) Wake up ya mongrel! Look you're pretty drunk, I mean, you're pretty tired. How 'bout letting me drive for a while? I do know how to drive, don't I Mick. Mick! You gotta be kiddin'. No Sheila's gonna drive my pride and joy. [Alice] Stop the car please. Mick? Wake up Mick? [Driver] What's wrong with you! [Mick] What are you doing? Why did we get out? You should be grateful I saved your life. I don't believe it. We'll get another ride. Come on. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here. Alone. Alright suit yourself. Mum my bag for me will ya? What are ya doing now? [Alice] Mick! Mick quick! Hurry! Alice! Where are you! Thought you'd been bitten by a snake or something. I found our next ride. This river doesn't go to Katherine. How would you know? I just do. Isn't there a river at Katherine? Yeah but... See? Trust me. We can't just take it. The owner might be around. Where? Can you see anyone? I can't see anyone. Maybe they dumped it. You know, like old cars. With a petrol tank in it? Look. Do you want to get to Katherine or not? I'll go and get my bag. Keep an eye out for crocs. [Alice] Uh oh, what's that? [Mick] That's a log stupid. That's the real thing. Well where else could she be? How on Earth would I know? Well you're a mother you should make it your business and all instead of lettin' her run wild, comin' and going whenever she likes. Shut up! (engine sputters) I told you to put petrol in it today, I even gave you the money! I did, look! Full tank! Must be the battery. Well if was your idea to keep the lights on. We'll have to clutch start it, get out and push. You get out and push! Well take the handbrake off! This is the life. Coulda been there by now. Here we go again. You sound like a broken record. It'll be your fault if he's not there. If he's expecting you he'll wait for you. He doesn't know I'm coming, does he. Oh. So you did run away. You want some? I want a thick shake and french fries. (animal growls) Crocodiles. Look out for the red spots. You know, their eyes. Better not lef the fire go out. Keeps the snakes away. (animal growls) (water splashes) (engine starts up) [Jack] Hey wait! [Man] You want me to throw you in there and make you a crock breakfast? [Alice] Leave us alone. You got no right. You had no right stealin' my boat. It's government property. You can go to jail for that. But how'd you find us? [Man] Whose idea was it? Don't you know there's a fire ban? Don't know where you thought you were going, the river doesn't go anywhere. Go on, get your bags. And hurry up. Missing person's report out on you two on yulunga radio. You kids are gonna be in big trouble when you get back ey? You're crazy. Yeah you're right, we might as well just give up. 406 to VKM. Oi! Come back! [Alice] What are you doing? [Mick] You want him to find us? Just help me push. Okay, let it go. How much money you got left? It's in the boat. Oh. You think he meant it about jail? Just remember. It was your idea to steal the boat. [Alice] Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Only two dollars a photo. A bargain at twice the price. Last chance! Hurry hurry hurry! Don't miss out on the chance of a lifetime. Only two dollars to get your picture taken with a genuine Australian Aborigini. Only two dollars a photo! Chance of a lifetime!

I thought you looked rather cute. Say something in Aborginal little boy! Well at least you made it sound real. It was! Was it? [Mick] Yes. I can speak the language. That's what all my family there in Katherine can speak. Yeah? Yeah. So what'dya say then? I said I was only doing this because some prawnhead was stupid enough to leave their bag behind.

She was worried sick sbout you, you know. [Girl] Cut it out Kevin! Where's Lyle? Lyle's out at the outstation with the men. Roy reckons he might be able to pop in and see them on his way through to Mount Isa. Lyle's a big boy now, not like you. You were always on the small side. You look like your dad. Lyle's about to become a man now. It'll be your turn next. I'm not gonna get initiated. That stuff's stupid. Well they might not have you anyway, the way you've been mucking up. Stop it Kevin! Here.

I promised Kath I'd put you on the bus to Darwin soon as you got here. But I don't want to go back! Well that's for you and Kath to work out. Kevin behave yourself. (dog growls) [Bus Driver] Attention all passengers catching the bus from Katherine to Darwin, your coach is ready for remaining depature so all aboard please. This is the first and final warning call for all passengers traveling from Katherine to Darwin, so all aboard please. Thank you. Come on Mick. You can't take that dog on the bus.

Got nowhere else to go. Where are we going? [Mick] To the outstation. Auntie Elva said Roy'd be there. [Alice] Then what were you doing on the bus? Auntie Elva was sending me back to Darwin. [Alice] They're all insane. [Mick] Who? [Alice] Adults. [Mick] Yeah. Ow, watch it! Which way? That way! [Alice] How do you know? [Mick] What are you doing! [Alice] Trust me. [Mick] That won't fool anybody. [Alice] We'll see. [Mick] So how'd you learn to drive? [Alice] I got mum to teach me. She said girls have gotta be independant and not rely on men for everything. I agree. None of this would've happened if you'd brought that kid up right. I tell ya certain things are gonna change now that I'm back. Two, we want two rooms please. Things have changed, hey Jack? (both laughing) [Alice] What am I gonna do? [Mick] You can't stay here. Besides there might be crocs here. And dogs bring them. It's true what I said about the crocodiles. I don't care if a croc does get me. Bush fires! They're fellows hunting for wallaby. They smoke them out. That's cruel. It's food, for them and those crows. They hang around for the leftovers. [Alice] No? [Mick] Like vultures. You wanna go back? No. You can't come with me when we get to the outstation. Who said I wanted to? Oh no! (car engine sputters) We've run out of petrol! What do I do if it comes out? [Mick] Catch it, stupid. [Alice] Do goannas bite? Only if you put your hand near its mouth. [Alice] Actually I'm not really hungry. [Mick] It tastes real good. Yeah? Where'd you learn all this stuff anyway? My mum taught me. She at the outstation too? No. Well is she dead? No. Where is she then? In the Kimberlies. I don't like the bloke she's living with. So Roy said he'd look after me. We've got the same Dreaming. Smoke Dreaming. I'm Church of England myself. You don't believe all that stuff do you? You believe that Moses parted the Red Seas and all those other miracles and things? Dunno. Dunno what I believe any more. So where's your dad? You know what? [Alice] What. You talk too much. I suppose we work our conscious out something like this that... (knock on door) Well if it's good for me, that's good.. Go away Jack. (Aboriginal folk music) [Singer] Thank you very much ladies and gentleman after a short break. Nice guitar. Cheap japanese (mumbles) Yeah where'd you get it? I said where'd you get the guitar, punk?! Hey man listen to me. But this is my guitar! It was in my wife's car being driven by my daughter now what have you done with her, huh? Someone call the coppers! If ya think you could take down ya... Hey cool it man I've never seen the guitar before. [Cop 1] Yeah tell me about one really. I've not done anything man! [Cop 1] You'll wanna pull your head in. [Cop 2] Cheap japanese rubbish. Kindof a surprise in this part of the country. [Cop 1] Which one of you mob's Charlie? That's him there. Your mate's blamin' ya. You'd better come inside for a chat, hey? He reckons he found it out on East Road. About fiteen K's out. Well what are you waiting for! We're waiting for the dawn sir. We won't see anything if we go out there now. Haven't you got any black-trackers? They're not supermen sir. They're human beings like you and me. They can't see in the dark. Anyway. It'll only be a few hours now. Yeah meanwhile my kid's stuck out there in the middle of nowhere... We'll keep our friend there in the lockup here overnight. And I suggest that if you don't want to join him, you'll go back to your motel room, and get a bit of shuteye. Now. Oh great idea, let's go on our beddy byes, hey? I think you could do with a bit of beauty sleep too. Thanks. [Mick] Why don't you like your dad? [Alice] It's a long story. You don't want to hear it. I talk too much remember? [Mick] I didn't mean it. What's wrong with him? [Alice] I don't know, everything. Well not everything, but nearly. At least, he's unreliable. [Mick] That's not so bad. [Alice] It is when you don't turn up at a concert that you're supposed to be playing your guitar at 'cause your six-year-old daughter's gonna sing a song that you wrote especially for her and made a big deal about it being her song and no one was gonna play it with her except you 'cause it was their special song. So he didn't turn up for a concert. Where did he go instead? Sydney. And I had to sing the song without him and he couldn't of cared less. He was thousands of kilometers away. Why did he leave? I dunno. Don't care either. So what do goannas really taste like? Dunno, never caught one. That rotten dog's got fleas. They're all over me. Hey, watch the doogo. Where's the other Toyota? It's out in the DUI. You take him. [Cop 2] Out! Where was it? Here. Where exactly? Right there (mumbles) Put her down here. Looks like she's heading south. Nope. What? It's too simple. If you're running from the cops you don't leave clues hanging around like that unless you want 'em found. Yeah you'd know wouldn't ya. [Jack] She's settin' up a false trail. Look the girl is twelve, right? But she's my kid, I know how she thinks. She thinks like me. Dead tricky. What's he on about? He doesn't know what he's talking about. [Cop 2] Look, tell 'em to swing it south. Shake 'em up in (mumbles) Creek, find out where the flying doctor is, get him to send a caravan out here. It's gonna be a long day. [Charlie] There was two of them. What? And a dog. Your legs are amazing, I mean no footprints nothin'. How do you do it? I passed them on the road. They were going that way, east. Why didn't ya say somethin'? Ya kiddin' me man? Look at the trouble I got into finding that guitar. Get in the car. What? Just get in the car. Hey what are you doin' with me car! Should I go after him Sarge? No no no, leave him. He might be right. For once in his life. At least he's out of my flamin' hair. You can use alcohol for fuel. Since when? We did it in science. Of course you wouldn't know. Oh yeah? Yeah. Watch. (engine sputters) Well that was a great idea. You got any better ones? We'll have to walk. Can't be that far. Besides there'll be water in them ridges over there. How do you know? [Mick] Look, I know. I've heard that one before. Anyway. White people are told never to leave their vehicles. What's that for? I don't want the dog to run away do I? I'm not leaving here. Look, no one knows we're here. You made sure of that. Besides, I know a shortcut. Come on. [Cop 1] She must be headed south. There's been no word from up north. [Cop 2] You realize we'll have to charge the kid for stealing the boat. Did a lot of damage to it. Least $300. She could be out there dead and that's all you can think of. Anything out of Wayne's CB, constable? Not as quick, I reckon it's been turned off. Your husband's an idiot Sue. He's gone and turned his flamin' radio off. He means for the best. [Charlie] Hey stop here for a sec! [Jack] Hey where ya goin! Don't want any more stuff man. You stay on this road, you'll find 'em. No sweat. What's up now? Trying to remember the landmarks. Every hill has its own name. You've never even been here. Yes I have, when I was a kid. We've gotta go that way. What? And get more lost? You don't really know where we are. It's not a shortcut at all. I don't know why you made me come here in the first place. I didn't make you come, I don't know why you did. What're you gonna do when we get there? Can't be too far now. Come on, let's go find some water. [Alice] Mick! Mick! Must be under the next ridge. (bird cawing) [Alice] Look out! Ah! [Mick] Run boy! (Alice screams) Who is it? It's my dad. Is he dead? No he's not dead. Take it easy mate! Sorry. Any water? Alice is just looking. Are you sure you know where you're going? 'Course I do. Get the map. Hello, hello! Is anybody there? Come in! He's so hopeless, he never gets anything right. Least he found us. Maybe your people will find us. They don't know where we are. I'll have to find them. Mick, you can't just leave us. What if he... I haven't got any choice. What else can I do? Mick! (dog barks) Get away from it! It'll kill you, you stupid dog! Stop it! Come here boy, come here! (dog yelps) Couldn't kill it. It's my Dreaming. [Alice] Dad? [Jack] Eh? [Alice] Thanks for coming. [Jack] Don't mention it. Dad? Yeah? I'm sorry about all this. It's my fault. No it's mine. No it's mine. You just didn't think. Look dad I'm not gonna argue, it's my fault and I want you to know I'm sorry. About everything. Thank you Alice. But don't you worry. I shoulda stayed in Sydney. Why did you leave Dad? Sydney? No I meant us. That last time. Why didn't you turn up at my concert? I waited and waited for you. I dunno Alice. I had a big fight with your mum and, I just sorta took off. Things weren't workin' out between me and your mum. She was gettin' all chewed up inside. Gettin', what she used to call, tension headaches everytime she looked at me. Migraines. [Jack] Yeah. She hasn't had those for years. You're a little ripper Alice. Streets ahead. I wish it could have been alright Dad. Between you and mum. And me. (singing an Aboriginal song) (singing Jack's song) (speaking Aboriginal) Did anyone ever tell you you've got beautiful eyes sweetheart? Did anyone ever tell you you've got a big mouth? (women laugh) [Roy] I should give you a belting. You're crazy that's what you are. And what were you doing bringing them here? You know white fellas aren't allowed to come here. Let alone white girls! We've got men's ceremonies going on. I never thought you'd be so stupid! And you! You'll all have to stay here in women's camp until the cops get here. Come on! It's time you grew up. (didgeridoo music) You don't have to go through with it Mick. Not if you don't wanna. Not if you're scared. [Mick] I can take it Roy. Yeah I know you can. Now shut up. (didgeridoo playing) [Jack] The circus'd come to town. [Cop 2] You alright mate? Yeah. Just as well, that car's gonna cost ya. Alright, you're should end up in the children's court on Monday. [Jack] Oi! Leave her alone. Stealing and damaging government property. Stealing a motor vehicle. Take it easy now. [Cop 2] Driving without a license. What do ya think about that Alice? [Alice] Sorry. What was that? I didn't hear you. [Alice] Sorry! Well, it nearly worked. Don't kid yourself mate you never had a chance. Still mates though, hey? Dad I think you should come back Darwin with us. And stay. Well at least 'til your leg's fixed and then... Well you know, whatever. Are you sayin' that I should come home with ya? No. What do you mean no? No, but thanks for the offer. It's the best present I ever had. And I know it's from the heart. Look. I've got a present for you too Alice. Thanks Dad. So where are you heading after this? Nowhere. I'm stayin' put. You know that guy who found my guitar? Well he shot through and they need another guitarist. I've got some really great plans for 'em, ey. (Sue laughs) Don't tell me I don't wanna hear about it. Come up for Christmas if you're still around. I gotta come up. Gotta to to Alice's school concert don't I? I wouldn't miss it this time sweetheart. Promise. God look at the smoke! Remember you've got certain responsibilities now you got initiated. Not allowed to lie or steal things. Or swear, or cheat. And you're not allowed to chase other men's wives either! 'Course I won't, Roy. You must remember everything you've been taught out there. Everything you've seen is yours. Respect it, and don't forget it. [Elva] I hope your car makes it back. So do I. Say hello to Kath for me, ey? I'll see you on the holidays. Make sure Kath's kids don't get their hands on them. From now on I'm doing the driving right?
