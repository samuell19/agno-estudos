He has a show. -Tomorrow, then. -He's going to Ostrava tomorrow. -Then after that. -After that? He'll be on tour for six months. Today's the fucking day. Chill, bro. Just record the track without him. It'll be a banger anyway, bro. Without him, it'll be shit. We won't get any listens, it won't be a banger. What do you mean, bro? Our last track has 1,500 listens already. That's huge. Give me his number. Fucking kebab. Faggot! Do it, man, call him. I'm stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey after that kebab. You want the rest? Do you even have it, man? -I didn't talk to Barracuda. -So, who'd you talk to? I talked to his manager. His manager? So, give me his number. I don't have his number.

Oh, I forgot that you're famous… All over Prague, right? What the fuck do you want? How'd you get this number? It's a private number. Don't say this shit on the phone, man. I don't care if it's Friday. No more fucking deliveries! -Alex, what are you doing here? -The banger fell through. Láďa fucked it up. He never even talked to Sergei. I'm sorry. What's that? I got them for graduation. -Ciao. -Hi. I'm bringing some friends. Honza Černý, fashion designer. Paris, Virgil Abloh, Forbes 30 Under 30. He did an incredible rebrand of Prestiges. -I heard. Great work. -Thanks. Nice shoes. Yeah, that's… Aleš. -Alex. -That's what I said. Fuck your celebrity lifestyle shit You're gonna blow me When I put out a new hit And what do you do? Well?

Černý came and asked me if I've got any Colombia. I didn't tell anyone. So how does he know? Sure, I brag to random people that you deal. For fuck's sake. It wasn't so long ago that you wanted to do a line with everyone you met. -Not anymore. Know why? -It doesn't make you feel good? I quit when I found out you weren't buying it, but selling it. -I don't mean to bother you, but-- -You are bothering us. Alex… Sorry, I'll wait till he grows up. No, Ivan, sorry. What do you need? Ivan? You call him Ivan? He's my boss. And I'm your boyfriend. What? You want him to be your boyfriend? You wanna be her boyfriend, Ivan? Well? You wanna be her boyfriend? -You could be her grandpa. -Alex! You wanna fuck her? Alex, you can't act like a caveman. -Let's go home. -I have work. What work? As a bartender? Really? You're saying that to me? You, who dropped out of school to sell drugs? I sell drugs so I can make music. For Christ's sake, you spent it all on clothes. Clothes are important. You gotta have drip to get anywhere. Come on, Happy's been home alone all day. -I'm not going anywhere with you. -Why not? 'Cause I'm not in Forbes? 30 Under 30? 'Cause I don't have friends like them? Or a degree? Your dad paid for yours from a private school, just like every upper-class cunt. Did you really just call me a cunt? Aren't you acting like one? So, I'll pick Happy up tomorrow. -Bro, she wasn't worth it anyway. -More like I'm not worth it. What do you mean? 'Cause you weren't in Forbes 30 Under 30? Bro, you still got another seven years. Seven fucking years. I don't have seven years, Láďa. I have until tomorrow. What's tomorrow? Tomorrow Sára is coming to pick up the dog. When a girl comes to get the dog, it's over. Come on… Nothing's as bad as it seems… I need to record that track, Láďa. I need to show Sára I can do it, that I'm worth it. I need these assholes to finally know my name, my face. And what should I do? You want me to go to Sergei's show and blow him or what? What are you doing? I'm gonna go see him. What do you mean? Where? To his show, like you said. I'm not gonna embarrass myself for nothing. What are you gonna do? Bake him a fucking cake or something? If you come with me, I'll give you some Colombia. What's up with you? You're kind of out of it. Well, bro, I took some Ritalin and kratom. Why? I thought we'd be making beats in the studio, not chasing some redneck around town. Holy shit, bro, she'd swallow you like I swallow Ritalin. She looks familiar. Bro, she looks like that singer Dua Lipa. What? That hot cunt from Albania or some shithole. Dua Lipa's from Kosovo. Bro, I said it was some shithole. Kosovo, bro. But it's cool someone from a shithole can get famous. -Everything's easier for hot girls. -Well, that's true. Holy shit, Sasha, my man… -What are you doing here? -Hey, Míra, long time no see. Who's this Lebowski, bro? What the hell? Is this junkie with you? Who's a junkie, you geriatric? Shut your trap, junkie. And, Sasha, you can't be here, man. -But I'm just going to a concert. Can't I? -That you can. And does Ilir know about this? It hasn't even started yet. Just the sound check. So why do you wanna go there? I just gotta see Sergei about music. Then we'll take off, really. -Likely story. -Míra, how long have we known each other? I swear, I'm just gonna go up and take care of something real quick. -Promise you won't stir up shit? -I promise. -With this little bugger? -He's alright. Little bugger, man? Alright, then. But I gotta pat you down. Not that I don't believe you. Yeah, sure. -Get over here, dummy! You too! -Okay, okay. Show me your bag… -So, you're not a junkie, eh? -Bro, that's just Ritalin. -Kiddie coke. -Bro, it's prescription. I got ADHD. Every fucking junkie says the same thing. I'm taking it. Don't act like a PE teacher. Give it back. It's mine. Not anymore. It's Ilir's now. -Should I knock his ass out? -We don't have time. Come on. Really, bro, what the fuck? Prick. Is it really you? Can I get a picture? Outside of concerts, I don't give a fuck about fans. Hey, Valentin… It's me, Láďa. We played Warzone together. I'm SeA_c0w. Who let you in here? We wanna do a collab with Sergei. -This is Alex Aurin. -Alex Aurin? Yeah, bro, like Alex and Lexaurin together. Never heard of him. Never mind. We've got a gang. Never Sober Boys. We want a collab. -Who doesn't? Write us after the tour. -We want it today. Go home and play PlayStation. -Hi, Valentin. -Hi, Genta. Girls, Sergei's waiting for you. Go on up. Thanks, sweetie, I owe you one. I told you hot girls have it easier. -How much for the collab? -More than you got. Wait, wait. Look… Versace chain, Prada jacket for 20K, Prada shorts, 17K. Shoes by Černý worth two grams of the best coke. Cash isn't a problem. Look… Here's 5K just to ask him how much for a verse. More. Nah, fuck money. Gimme the Versace chain. -But my girl gave me this. -Then piss off. Fuck… Hey! But it's gotta be today. Wait here. Alright, he'll do it, but it's gonna cost you. -Money's not a problem. -Five thousand. Alright. Five thousand euros. That much? You want it today, don't you? So, we got a deal? Deal. Call when you've got it. Cash-- that clear? You've got until the show starts. Not a minute more. Understand? You got 5,000 euros? No. I put it all into our merch. So where you gonna get it, bro? And you don't have anything? Take a guess. I don't have to. Dick. Bro, so you're completely broke? I got something, man, but… Around 50K. How many euros is that? I dunno, man. Two thousand? Shit. Hey, Sasha, what are you doing here? I came about some music. Still haven't given up on those stupid dreams? You're still into that? Do I need to pat you down? I quit, man, I swear. I'm fucking with you. Chill out. Relax. But the look on your face… Just having a laugh, Sasha. And you know what? It's good you quit. Bitcoin goes down, then it goes back up. You lose tons of money this way. Tons of money, my friend. You wanna come work at my coat check again? 'Cause you got talent, kid. -I don't think so. -Why not? -I don't want anything to do with it. -With what? With what? I don't wanna sell meth-spiked coke to kids. Meth-spiked coke? What meth? What kids? Search him. -What the fuck? -Just chill. Oh, a little gift. That's for my collab, man! What collab? What's a collab? You have lousy dreams, my friend. There's not gonna be any collab. And you know what? You actually didn't lose much. Next time, it's gonna cost you a hell of a lot more. Bitch. Get out of here. You worked for the Albanian? Do I have a rich dad? And you think I do, bro? I sold out of the coat check for a while. Then he started cutting it with shit, so I decided to do deliveries instead. And where do you wanna get the cash now? You got any product left? A couple grams. 5K worth. Bro, can I get a bump? Bro, you promised. Bro… That is so pure. Fuck… Bro, it'd be alright if you cut it a little bit, wouldn't it? Do you know who Ross Ulbricht is? He's the guy who founded Silk Road. The most sophisticated website for buying drugs, from marijuana to heroin or cocaine. -You know why he did it? -To make cash like a boss. No, man. 'Cause people were buying shit off the street and dying. Piece-of-shit fucking junkie, man… Thanks to him, when you buy Colombia, you know it's Colombia and not Chomutov mixed with Tirana, man. If people could test their gear here like in Amsterdam, then Ilir would go right back to northern Albania. Even so, bro… You know how much money you could make with this? That Albanian would turn these two grams into 30. And that's… A shitload, bro. Don't you need a shitload? Five thousand euros. -If you cut it a bit, no one will notice. -My customers will. Bro, you don't have any customers anymore. Just sell it to chumps who've never had your blow. I think I gave you my last one, and you even ate the fucking baggie with it. Idiots who just wanna get fucked up. Láďa, this isn't GTA, man. So where do you wanna get the cash, then, bro? I'll sell my drip. I got more than a mil worth. Happy! Come here, you! You're a good boy. You missed me, eh? I missed you too. Come on, you want some water? So, did you eat anything? Huh? Attaboy, attaboy. Attaboy, eat it all up. I won't give you up. I won't give you up, boy. I won't give you up, alright? That's another Supreme. That one's Gucci. Off-White. Gosha Rubchinskiy. I wanted to wear that to my wedding. This? That's Gucci. It cost 20K, bro. Fifty. 50K? Fifty kilograms. We buy by the kilo here, gentlemen. And how much per kilo? Thirty crowns. Bro, what if we sold this jalopy? This piece of shit? It's done more miles than you've done drugs. At least it'd be something anyway. On Friday night? Everything's closed. Bro, you know what Sergei would do… Buy once, cut twice Triple your profit, then go re-up Thanks a lot, bro Don't thank me, go hustle It's the only way to make it Don't go chasing hoes Stack your money high White snow like Raffaello Versace specs are what I'm wearing Wipe my brow with a Benjamin, bro! Sergei B's a dealer! Sergei B's a dealer! Sergei B! Sergei B! Sergei B's a dealer! Whoo! I don't even know how the fuck to cut it, man. You douchebag, bro. Where the fuck's my phone? So, look, bro… From these two grams, we'll be able to make… -a shitload. -How? Go to the kitchen and find anything that looks like blow. That's not enough, bro. No good, bro. Needs a bigger kick. What's that you say? You don't know how to sell it? Buy once, cut twice Triple your profit, then go re-up -What about Ritalin? It's kiddie coke. -Bro, that PE teacher took it all. So, something else you take for ADHD, then. -I don't have ADHD. -You don't? Do I look like I have some kind of disorder? Something else, then. Thanks a lot, bro Don't thank me, go hustle It's the only way to make it Don't go chasing hoes Stack your money high When I'm slinging, wait in line If you want more, then get behind White snow like Raffaello Versace specs are what I'm wearing Sergei B's a dealer! Sergei B's a dealer! Sergei B! Sergei B! Sergei B's a dealer! -Is that a sewing kit? -Bro, it's my survival kit. In this video, we'll show you what should be in a survival kit. I've got a few leftovers I haven't taken, bro. Can you even mix those? Bro, you sell drugs, but you know fuck all about 'em. Check it out. It's got all the drugs and what happens when you mix them. I'll start with… K as in ketamine. Ketamine? Bro, what does the chart say? Yellow. Calvin Klein, bro. -Molly. -MDMA… Yellow. M as in meth. You do crystal? No, just sometimes when I need to get clean. Speed. Speed? The poor man's cocaine. D as in debts. Shit, or is this more Special K? Just a little! Chill, bro. It's used to treat depression. It's a horse tranquilizer. A little bit of ket won't kill anyone. What's GHB? It's red everywhere. GHB is for when you wanna fuck a lot. But don't worry, it's liquid. That's why people slip it in chicks' drinks. ROUND 2 C as in cut. A as in almost done. We can't sell it like that. It's gotta be a rock. How do you wanna stick it together? So, just one more thing… What chump do we sell it to? We gotta test it. We can't sell anything we wouldn't try ourselves. -Me? I can't, bro, I gotta stay clean. -Why? -I get tested. I'm on probation. -You did a line earlier. Yeah, but that was pure blow. I'll piss it out by Wednesday. And I found you passed out in the studio. That was all prescription drugs. What'd you even do to get on probation? So, you passed out at a party. It can happen to anyone. Look at my hand, bro. You passed out with your dick in your hand? Yeah. And you got put on probation? I was horny, bro. I woulda fucked anything. Never mind, then. I'll test it myself. -Do it! Do it! Do it! -Come on! Now! Do it! Do it! Do it! You're such a shit. What an idiot. Can you believe that? I couldn't watch you anymore, bro. Do you feel anything? Bro, I don't feel a thing. We gotta add more. No, we're not adding anything else. You've got the tolerance of Tyler Durden. Buddy, if I had to take an exam on smoking crystal… I'd get an A-plus. I'm a diligent junkie. We're only gonna sell this shit to assholes. Clear? Every last one of you I'd piss on you all Politicians and ministers I'd piss on 'em all Teachers and cops I'd piss on 'em all All your stupid whores I'd piss on 'em all The people in your crew I'd piss on 'em all Your mom and your sister and your dad-- Bro, why you always gotta be so edgy? Edgy? The pissing. What should I write about when the world's full of assholes? How about chicks? You can piss on them too, but out of love. You never pissed on Sára? I don't piss. I diss. Exactly, bro. I write these tracks because of assholes like Ivan. Bro, Ivan doesn't seem like an asshole to me. So, you think it's okay to buy people? To buy fame, man? To buy Sára? But you're buying Sergei, bro. I don't have a rich dad. And I'm not a hot girl. I'm just trying to even up the starting line. Speaking of lines, who are we gonna sell this to? To the chump who's been calling me all day. I don't care if it's Friday. That's one hell of a chump, bro. But before we sell it to him, I need to talk to him. What? When I'm done talking, I'll give you a signal. What signal, bro? What do you mean? The signal is that he's an asshole. How do you all know each other? From work. Some corporation, right? In fintech. So, a fucking corporation. It's not a corporation. We've got a start-up. A damned good one. What the hell is that? Start-up is a fancy word for a company that doesn't make money. And what do you do? Me? I make music. So, a fancy word for a drug dealer. So, how much do you faggots want? -I don't know, a gram? -No, two. You going out tonight? I dunno what they planned for my bachelor party. The only thing we can tell you is that there's gonna be pussy. -I don't want any pussy. I love Monika. -But today, buddy, you're allowed. So, how about ten? Ten? Are you nuts? We don't even need five, do we? Well… -Alright, we'll take ten. -What? Wait… -I'm not paying, man. -I'll pay for it… but I wanna sample it first. -Go on, buddy. -Do it. -You want a straw? -Let's go, boys. What's that? -What are you doing, man? -You'll see… You'll see, man, you'll see. Introducing… Jasmina. Hi, gentlemen… Not you, I guess… So, it's you, eh? I'd really like to, but I've got a girl. Oh, what girl? Come on… Touch me, don't be scared. -Should we go? -Where? Somewhere we can enjoy ourselves. Tell me why it's not working… -Give him a line! -Yeah, do a line! -Do a line! -You'll get hard, man! You guys have blow? Can I have a line too? Of course! Can Jasmina have a line too? Bro, where are you going? -Hey, wait! -Did I say something wrong? -What are you doing, bro? -We're leaving. Why, bro? Ten grams is 25K! I fucking said we're leaving. You want more? I'll give you 30K. Dan has to get laid tonight. This shit is super strong. Girls can't handle it. You should've just said that. We won't give her any. Easy-peasy, man. -No, sorry, just no. -Alex… Bro, if you keep this up, Sára's cunt is gonna be on Ivan's dick. You want that? Answer me, bro. Only us guys will take it. Really. Mainly Dan. Don't ruin his bachelor party. But don't give any to Jasmina. Or any other girls. Clear? Clear. Get rid of this. You said 30, didn't you? What the fuck are you doing, Láďa? You told me to get rid of it. Why are you looking so pissy again, bro? We got 30K. -I don't know who else to sell it to. -I dunno. Let's go to a bar. How about Ankali? Ankali? Full of students who split one E between five of them. No point. Karlovy Lázně? Duplex? Do we have gelled hair and Philipp Plein tees? Nope. So where else do people do coke? At rap shows. Well, there's only one in Prague tonight. But there'll be plenty of assholes there. Shit, bro, that fucking Albanian, though… Next time, it's gonna cost you a hell of a lot more. Bitch. Get out of here. Bro, how are we gonna get past that geriatric? Míra's cool. Cool, bro? He took all my Ritalin! If you just chill out, Míra will too. Bro, he called me a junkie. Shit, your eyes look like Toffifees. Láďa, put on your fucking sunglasses and shut your mouth. If you keep quiet, you won't blow it. -That's not ours. -We don't know how it got there. Alright, well, either I take it and you go inside… or you take it and go home. Or I call the cops. Let's let it go. We'll go in. You can keep it. Chill, bro. Are you fucking kidding me? -His mouth is running like a train. -What, bro? He had a really spicy kebab. With garlic sauce, bro. Brutal. From that dude in Žižkov. You know him, right? You know what, Sasha? Take him and get the fuck outta here. Míra, can't you make an exception? For me? For you? Thanks to you, Ilir chewed my ass out, so-- Son of a bitch! You're a fucking pig! Sasha, take him and get the fuck outta here! Míra, can I at least clean him up? In the bathroom. Please. Look at him. Please. Hey, Láďa, are you alright? Hey? Fucking gross. I'm fine, bro. What's up? -You still got puke everywhere. -What do you mean-- oh, shit. What kind of shit did you mix in there? It's cool, bro. It's the only way he'd let us in. And that sweat's just an act too? Bro, it's from that kebab. It's not some hipster kebab. You know that dude doesn't worry about quality. Are you kidding me, bro? What is it now, bro? What's up your ass? We'll sell it here. It's good shit. So, what the fuck? You wanna make this banger or what? You have to go down alone. I can't let the Albanian see me. You'll go down, find some assholes… and bring them here. Cool, cool. And how do I tell that they're assholes, bro? They have money, nice clothes, nice pussy… They just think that they're better. I don't care about people They're all the same You're all trash So fuck you Bring your dad I'll fuck him up Every last one of you I'd piss on you all Every last one of you I'd destroy you You're just the sort That I can't stand We're laughing at you But you think your jokes land Even Jesus or Buddha I'd knock his lights out Bro… Ta-da, bro! Ciao. Hi, sweetie. Hola… -What's up? -Well, guys? You retard, they're barely out of high school. So? They got straight As in getting high. -Do you still have those poppers? -Yeah, here you go.
