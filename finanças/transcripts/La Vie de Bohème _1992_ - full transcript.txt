Based on the Novel by HENRI MURGER Shit! Did I hurt myself? My God - blood! - Everything okay, Marcel? - No. What do you think, with the middle of my face smashed in? Red wine. These glasses are smaller than a drunkard's dreams. - Any luck with the publisher? - No, the swine! He said it was too long and demanded cuts, but with no promises and no advance - the lout! - Why not let me read it? - You? Yes, me. You can read? Are you kidding? I finished third grade in Mongéo before coming to Paris. I'll read it at bedtime. Why not? You'll give me the people's appraisal and put the publishers to shame. The Avenger - A Play in 21 Acts by Marcel Marx EVICTION NOTICE Good morning, Monsieur Marcel. Have you forgotten that today is the eighth? Already? How time rushes on! You're a bit slow in vacating the premises. It's already 11:30. The new tenant may arrive at any moment. Allow me to find a moving van. By all means! But there's one little formality to see to first: your three months' back rent. Would you mind? - Of course not. Then kindly step into my office, so I may give you a receipt. - When I return. - Why not now? I must go to the bank. I don't carry a sum like that on me. I see. No cash. Then allow me to relieve you of that little burden so it doesn't tire you. You think I'd carry off my belongings in a bag? Those are the rules. You're not to remove so much as a single hair until the rent is paid. There's no hair in here, just shirts I'm taking to the laundry next door to the bank, just steps from here. Please do not misunderstand me, but certain unfortunate experiences have shattered my faith in tenants. Hugo had best accompany you to the bank. See this man? He's been casing this bank for three days. I live across the street. His accomplice is around the corner in an Alfa Romeo, reading Le Monde - upside down. I only wish to do my duty. My life's savings are in this bank. What do you suppose is in his bag? Has my apartment been vacated? Not yet, Monsieur Schaunard, but very soon. The previous tenant, a writer, has gone to get a moving van. In the meantime, you may leave your furniture outside. I'm afraid. If it rains, my furniture will be damaged. You will forgive me if I ask your profession. You neglected to indicate that on the lease. Leave the piano here and return at once to my old lodgings for the rest of my priceless furnishings and works of art. Henri, from the Ministry of War. It just arrived by courier. The Ministry of War. It must be the pension that I've been waiting for all these years. At last some recognition of my achievements. Dear Monsieur Bernard, courtesy demands that I inform you of the unfortunate predicament I find myself in that prevents me at this time from observing the custom requiring that rent be paid, especially when it's due. Until this morning I had hoped to honor this lo very day by paying my rent - ah, delusion! As I slept cradled in false certainty, misfortune - Ananke in Greek - dashed my hopes. Certain sizable sums I expected did not materialize, but our beautiful France and I will see better days - have no doubt of that. The moment we do, I shall hasten to inform you of it and to remove from my lodgings my precious possessions, which I leave to your safekeeping and to that of the law, which restrains you from selling them for one year. Until then you are at liberty to use the luxurious lodgings in which I have resided. In affirmation of my consent, I hereby affix my signature. Marcel Marx. - Two half orders of trout. - Yes, sir. That's a strange order. On the contrary. This method yields on average a quarter more than ordering a full portion. Where is my order? I'm afraid this gentleman got the last trout. May I invite you to partake of this course with me? I would not deprive you of what is yours, sir. Then you'd deprive me of the pleasure of expressing my goodwill? In that case, sir... Permit me to refrain from serving you the head. That I couldn't allow. For if the head is man's noblest appendage, it's the most unpleasant part of a trout. Two heads! This trout is bicephalic, a word which comes from the Greek and means... precisely that. Nevertheless, I harbor no regrets about eating this phenomenon. The sauce was delicious. True. It was prepared in the province of Béarn, and its fine reputation is richly deserved. You seem very learned. You're not from here? No. I come from Albania and have lived in Paris only three years now. Yet you've already mastered our language. My nursemaid was French, from Barcelona. My name is Rodolfo, and I'm a painter. Marcel Marx, writer. May I offer you a bottle of wine? Only on one condition: that I see to the coffee and the rest. As a painter, don't you think that Malevich's Black Square is as lethal a blow to painting as the school of Vienna - Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, and the rest - is to music? - I agree entirely. - Let's go. I live just around the corner. We may continue our discussion there. “I floated down impassive rivers, unguided now by bargemen's hands. Howling natives had hauled them up for targets and nailed them naked to painted stakes.” Beautiful stuff, Rimbaud. He and Verlaine argued vehemently about - Anyway, come inside. This is where I live. Strange. The key's in the lock, though I put it in my pocket this morning - where it remains even now. It's witchcraft! Two keys. Someone's playing the violin. These aren't my lodgings. May I help you? I was mistaken. This isn't my apartment. I beg your pardon on my friend's behalf. He's exceptionally drunk. Wait, this is my place. That's my finery! And what's this? My Turkish slippers, given to me by beloved hands! “Marcel Marx is hereby obligated to vacate the premises by noon on February eighth...” Am I not the Marcel Marx whom the landlord evicted? The situation is as follows. By law the premises are mine, for you were evicted, and I paid in advance. Yes, for the premises, but not the furnishings. If I pay up, I may remove them legally - or even illegally, if it were possible. Thus you have furnishings but no lodgings, and I have lodgings but no furniture. - Precisely. I like the apartment. And I've never liked it more. - Pardon? Never as much as now, and I know what I'm saying. What do you say we lubricate this explanation? What an amazing pipe you have. I have an even more handsome one for use in high society. Would you care to try it? - With pleasure. You appear to be a man of musical bent. A composer. I'm writing a piece called “The Influence of Blue on the Arts.” - I can't see anyone just now. - Why not? Good morning. Good morning, mademoiselle. - There's my answer. - I understand. All the same, perhaps you might lend me 1,000 francs. I'm all out of paint, and I can't complete my masterpiece. You're asking a lot. I'm broke at the moment. Couldn't you borrow it from the girl? I couldn't do that. We just met yesterday. - And Schaunard? - No one's seen him all week. Good-bye. Where are you going? To your place... to collect what you owe me. You won't find me at home. I can't pay you back today. I'm waiting for a girl. But you can pawn my ring. There she is. Beat it. What if she comes back to you? You'd no longer have the ring. She won't come back. She ran off with an American. He had a Cadillac. It's a shame about the children. She left them with me, and I don't have enough to feed them. They cry out from hunger in the night. How old are they? Fourteen... nine... seven... six... three... two... one... and the youngest is just six months. So many! We were young and in love. It was spring. You look strange. What's the matter? I think I have fallen in love. With whom? I don't know... but she's sitting over there. She's not bad-looking. Why don't you do something? What if she rejects me? I'd never get over it. It's our custom in Albania to first - You stay here. I'll go speak to her on your behalf. I will awaken in her heart a passion... for you. I will lie shamelessly. Good evening. See that man over there? He is in love with you. But so am I. Excuse me. Can I help you? I fell asleep. Where are you going? Nowhere. I arrived in town, but my girlfriend isn't in. I was to stay with her. It's no use waiting. She was taken to prison, for three years. What am I going to do now? I arrived today from Rouen. I don't know anyone here. If you like... I live next door. Tell me: Are you a proper French gentleman? No. I mean, yes... but I'm not French. I'm Albanian. That Will do. I'm going now and taking the dog with me. He sometimes makes noise at night due to nightmares. But why? I can sleep on the sofa. It's too hard for a bed. And besides... I'm hot-blooded, and you are very beautiful. - Where will you go? - To a friend's. He lives close by. Sleep peacefully. I'll be back in the morning. Baudelaire. “I have gone to seek lodgings. Thank you for your kindness. Mimi.” Where's your black coat? Can't you see? You've ruined it. I'm lost. I've been summoned by Gassot, the newspaper czar. He's founding a fashion magazine, The Sash of Iris, and plans to make me editor in chief. If I show up in this getup, he may change his mind. You can't accept his offer anyway. Gassot is a supporter of the right. Your principles won't allow you to eat bread bathed in the sweat of the people. - You're mistaken. He's in the left flank of the right wing in Parliament. Just yesterday he voted for widows' pensions. Besides, he knows influential people whom I'll convince to commission compositions from you and portraits from Rodolfo. That changes everything. What time's your meeting? At 5100. There's no time to lose. I can polish my shoes black so no one will notice that one is round-toed and the other pointed. I need a black coat! I'd give ten years of my life and my right hand for one. - Is Rodolfo the painter in? - That's me. My cousin recommends your reasonably priced portraits. I'm told they're very good likenesses. More accurate than photographs. He's very talented. He won every award at school. My son won an award, and he's only seven. A talented child. This portrait you want, Monsieur... Blancheron, from Nantes. I'm a sugar producer. I've even written books on the subject. I'd like a medium-sized portrait. Like that one. Who is that of? My mother. How much would one of that size cost? Between 1,000 and 1,200 francs, depending on whether your hands show. - My cousin said 500. - It depends on the season. Paint prices vary with the season. - Interesting. Just like sugar. - Precisely. - Paint me one for 1,000 francs. - You're making a mistake. For 200 more, he'll paint your hands holding your book on sugar. You simply must do it. - Would that look good? Exceptionally good. Is the portrait for your home? Yes, the living room. Then you must be in a dressing gown. Please sit in this chair. Take off your coat. I don't have a dressing gown with me. Don't worry. My friend will lend you his. Marcel, please hang up the gentleman's coat. How unfortunate. I'll be late for supper. The restaurant downstairs will send up anything we want. I'll go order something. I have several ideas to improve the contents of your magazine. For instance, one could - this is just one possibility - one could publish a play, and on the facing pages show the characters dressed in a certain way as if it were the fashion - the latest fashion, of course. One could also envision other things, like, for example, publishing the works of Baudelaire in serial form - When may I come for it? I'll finish it tomorrow and bring it to you. I'd prefer to pay at once so as not to remain in debt to you. We're alike in that respect. My cash is at the hotel. You'll have it tomorrow. Now, if you'd get me my coat... It was very dusty, so I had it laundered. They only charged 40 francs. Just add it to my bill. I'm not paying a thing! Shit! The swine! He wanted to charge me for a few miles. There must be 60,000 francs there. 15,240, to be precise - an advance for producing a sample issue of The Sash of Iris. Here's my plan. Secure from life's material woes, I intend to go about this seriously. First I'll get rid of these rags and dress decently so that the fashion salons will take me seriously. If you'll follow my example, I can hire you as door-to-door ad salesmen. Until then, let a strict economy govern our lives. I accept wholeheartedly. But to start with, give me a couple of thousand francs. Why? As a door-to-door salesman, I must have a car to call on potential advertisers in the provinces. That's true. Shall we order a table? Yes. Then I can tell you more about my new job. There's an excellent restaurant not far from here. It's a bit expensive, but we'll make it up in the time we save. Very well, but starting tomorrow we shall devise even greater means of economizing. No more eating out. We'll hire a woman to cook for us. It would be wiser to take on a manservant who could then double as cook. Our household would be in impeccable order and we'd have much more time to work with him to shine our shoes and see to our errands. Then we'll need larger accommodations. That, in any case, is unavoidable if we mean to live in keeping with our new position in society. I'll be back. A pack of Celtiques, please. Good evening, Mimi. You found work. As you can see. - And a place to live? - It comes with the job. Are you going to the nightclub? I just came along with my friends. I don't care for modern music. I'm going to have a drink. A glass of water, please. - Who was that? - A regular. He has the manners of a peasant. It's kind of you to see me home, but this is nowhere near where I live. I wish you lived in Moscow so I might have your company that much longer. That's a bit too far. We could take the boulevard. Fancy that. We've arrived by chance where I live. Wouldn't you like to come up and say hello to the dog? Very well, but just for a moment. I'll make some coffee. In the meanwhile, you may enjoy the city view from my window. They wilted. Had I known, I'd have bought plastic flowers. What's his name? Baudelaire. I'm out of coffee, but I'll make some soup. May I kiss your hand? You move fast. The sooner to reach the goal. How much is this? A hundred francs. Fifty. All right. For you, 50. How about this? I live with two other girls. They have a male friend in common whom they're constantly fighting over. I don't get it. The man is stupid and ugly, and married to boot. Uglier than me? There's no comparison. Next to him, you're Lino Ventura. Who's that? An Italian movie star. You don't know him? Forget him. Let's talk about me. Why not... move in with me? I'm against marriage in principle, but we could make an exception. You'll stop working. I'll support us both with my paintings. And what would I do? You'd walk Baudelaire, clean the place - that sort of thing. Are you serious? I'll clean... and you can look out the window at the park. In the evenings we'll go to the opera. My wallet's been stolen. Do you have any money? Just a few francs. Police? Your passport. Listen, how much is their check? Four hundred twenty. Will you allow me to pay it? You think you'll get your money back from that burn? It doesn't matter. Then as far as we're concerned, the matter is settled. I have to go now. I start work at 9:00. I have to wait for my passport. I'll come by your place tomorrow evening. I'll be waiting. Come with me. Why? There's something suspicious about your papers. You've resided in France for three years with no visa, no residence permit, no work permit. You claim you came by train from Spain, but you choose to say nothing more. There is nothing more to say. Very well. You'll spend the night here. We'll decide your fate in the morning. May I make a call? My dog is home alone. - In the morning. You're to be deported immediately to Albania. The flight for Athens leaves in two hours. If you're found within France's borders again without the necessary papers, it will mean six months in jail. May I make a call now? Make it fast. Mimi hasn't arrived yet. I don't know. Try again in a couple of hours. Morning, Henri. - Someone just called for you. - Who? He didn't say. Could you make me a coffee? Listen... I'm being deported. Will you look after Baudelaire and my paintings? I won't be coming back. They'll put me in jail if I do. Understand? Good-bye, Rodolfo. - A Suze. - Problems? No. Just thirsty. What do you think? 1,800 francs. Only 19,000 miles. It has brakes... and everything. Great. Are you free this evening? What's bothering you? You don't seem too enthusiastic. Rodolfds been deported. No papers. Shit. I'll go get Baudelaire. Let's meet there tonight and haul his paintings to your place. All right. Evening, ma'am. - Are you looking for Rodolfo? - Yes. We were to meet here. Where is he? He's been deported. He was in the country illegally. When? This afternoon. Is he coming back? I don't know. I have to go. Shut the door when you leave. SPRING Hello, Musette. How's it going? What's it look like? How many today? We have to go to press Friday. Just one, but a full page. For Printemps. I know. They called and cancelled it. Coffee originated in Arabia, where it was discovered by a goat. Balzac drank 70 cups a day. What are you up to with that ladder? It's the link between me and my beloved. Have you read Shakespeare? Of course. He was a great philosopher. Do you remember Romeo and Juliet? Do I remember it? “It was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.” Don't you understand? I've met a girl from a good family, but for certain reasons her father can't stand me and has threatened to kill me. The girl's name is Juliette, and her room just happens to have a balcony. I came to borrow this bird to wake me every morning before the old man gets up. I'd be obliged if from now on you'd call me Romeo Montague. What do you think of my plan? The Sash of Iris, hello. It's for you, Marcel, from abroad. All right. Where? What time? Very well. Forget about your Juliette. We have to go. - Where? - The border. I'll explain on the way. Let me have a few hundred. - There is no money. Where did it all go? I paid the printer so they'd give me the magazines. You could have left them there. We need a picture for the cover. Hold still. Now let's go. There he is. Shall we go? We can make Paris by morning. - When is Mimi in? - Mimi isn't here anymore. But they stop in almost every evening. Who's “they”? Mimi and Francis, her boyfriend. Why do you ask? I'm an old friend. Thank you. Good evening. How are you? - Fine. Someone was asking for you. - Who? An old friend. He's sitting over there. I believe The Crossing of the Red Sea is finished. I feel empty. If you manage to sell it, we can pay the rent. Perhaps you could come down on the price. I won't sell it for less than 200 francs. I've already put over 10,000 francs' worth of paint into it. What if the landlord calls the police? You still don't have a residence permit. Come in. What a surprise. Would you offer our guest a glass of water? To what do I owe this honor? I was so inspired by your portrait that I've decided to become a collector. I'm now looking for a relatively large painting, and I thought of you. You're in luck. I just finished this one and intended to send it off in the morning with some other works to an exhibition in New York. But if you'd care to make an offer... as an old customer... I like the work very much. I'll give you 1,000 francs. - You're joking. - 1,200. 2,000. 1,400. 1,700. 1,500... and two tickets to the opera this evening. Opera is a dying art form, but all right. Go pay the rent and then get dressed. You and Musette can go to the opera. I'll wait outside. I have to talk to Marcel. Poor girls. They were never meant to live like this. Being men, and thus stronger in every respect, we bear up joyfully under every misfortune. We don't sink into depression if our outfit isn't always neat and tidy. But for women it's different. The simplest frock brings them joy, and one can't fault them for that. On the other hand, the market for art and literature has been bustling recently. We'll soon be earning nearly as much as porters at the Gare de L'Est. It's true. Works of art are selling like pancakes. Then it's agreed. Tomorrow we take the girls shopping to indulge their feminine whims. Sunday we'll go on a picnic in the countryside. What about me? You have two days to find yourself a companion. It's not our fault if your appearance sparks no interest in the opposite sex. But if you have no luck, you can still come along... as our driver. Monsieur, there's a call for you in the kitchen. Madame... your eyes are like two moons. Let's hope it doesn't come to more than 600 francs. And never come back! They didn't like it? Idiots! They tried to discourage me. They said I should break my brushes in two and jump out the window. Let's go borrow some money from Marcel and go out to eat. I gave you a cash advance. I want it back in two days. Not three or five. Two days. Good luck... and good-bye. What was that all about? He's mad that I serialized my play. Says it didn't suit the magazine's style and that readers complained. What readers? Besides, as editor in chief, I set the style. He was just the publisher. Capitalist! - I'm hungry. - Me too. Come eat at my place. I happen to have a little money. While we're at it, I can play my latest composition for you. I'm going to leave Marcel. When? Tonight. I've already packed. Does he know? I didn't dare tell him. I'm going back to Strasbourg. There's this farmer there. He's not great-looking, but he's sweet... and dependable. Why? Marcel doesn't need me. All he loves is his books. Yesterday I pawned my ring for rent money. I left the money on the table. When I came back, he'd taken it... and spent it all on first-edition Balzacs. Poor Marcel. He'll forget me in a week. In any case, quicker than I'll forget him. That's how men are. Will you see me to the station? - Of course. I'll miss you. You must come visit! I'll send you the fare. The man's rich. I promise. Write to me care of general delivery. Why general delivery? I don't know. How's it going, Mimi? Fine. Can I give you a ride? You can drive me home. Yes, darling. I found work. You needn't have. I can't go on living like this, never having any money. I can't breathe. It's like I'm suffocating. I'll open the window. That won't help. Besides, it's already cold in here. Shall I light a fire in the stove? There's no wood or coal. Some old poems of mine. I thought I'd publish a collection... someday. At least they'll provide some heat. I'm going for a little walk. Don't be too long. Hello, Rodolfo. Hello, Mimi. I love you, you know, but life is hard. Yes. I understand. I drink. Glass after glass To forget all about my wife's friends I drink. Glass after glass To forget all my troubles I drink. Any old swill As long as it's strong I drink. The cheapest stuff It's rough But it passes the time Is life really such a lark? Is it really so exciting? I ask Those two questions AUTUMN Is it worth living? Or loving, only to be cheated on? I ask those two questions But no one ever answers And so I drink Glass after glass What? Nothing. It's very good. The voice of the people is the voice of God. EVEN MOSES USED BLANCHERON SUGAR That there is known as turkey with truffles. Look at the color of that leg of lamb! Lamb is the favorite food of the gods and also of my godmother, Madame Chandlier. And what about those trout? They're superb swimmers. They climb rapids as quickly as we'd accept an invitation to dinner this evening. That fruit is known as pineapple. I almost got to taste one once. Speaking of fruit, I wouldn't say no to that pheasant there. Why this profusion of delicacies? You don't know? It's All Saints' Day, a great family celebration. Would you care to spend the evening with me? No money. How much have you got? I don't understand. I've lost my appetite. Same here. I can see that a phantom from the past sits at this table. But if you intend to waste away to nothing, you could do so just as well on a full stomach. Am I disturbing you? Come in. I'm so cold. I happened to be passing by and saw the light in the window. I lost my apartment a week ago, and I've been wandering the streets ever since. I'm posing for artists these days, but it doesn't pay much. Oh, I only show my face and hands. They've promised to pay me tomorrow. Then I'll move back into my apartment. - Where are you two going? - To get some cigars. In Havana. We'll be back tomorrow sure as arrows loosed by a steady hand. Where have you been? Don't ask any questions. Just let me sit here by your side. It's so warm here. I'll stay until tomorrow. All right? It's going to be very cold here. Good. It'll be just like before. I'll clear the table. The warmth has made me dizzy. I can hardly stand up. You have a fever. I'll help you into bed. Schaunard and I will go get a doctor. You stay here and keep Mimi company. I was awake the whole time. Rodolfo still loves me. What about you? I never stopped loving him. Then all is well. I'm going away forever. What are you talking about? I'm going to die soon. Look. You believe me now? If I'd stayed here with Rodolfo, everything would be fine now. Poor Rodolfo. He has to take care of me once again. But not for long. The last dress he buys me will be white. Don't talk like that. You'll get better. Rodolfo has gone for a doctor. It took me an hour to climb the stairs yesterday. But if I'd found another woman here with him, I'd have thrown myself right out the window. Rodolfo knows everything. She must go to the hospital - my hospital. I'll call an ambulance. I have a car. You must be brave. I can ease her pain, but I can't save her. She'll live until spring at the latest. I can keep her in a private room, but I must warn you: Though it may seem cruel, it's very expensive. I'll find the money. Who painted this? Becker? Open the curtains. Spring is here, and I want to look outside. It's so grey in here. Why don't you pick me some flowers? She's dead. Shall we come with you? That's all right. I need to be alone.
