Mom, say mom! Say! Say dear! I’ll buy you a chocolate, say mom. Say, dear. Mom! My baby, please say dear. MOM! -Why are you laughing? -Look there sister. Again! I’m right here, why couldn’t you say? Come on sister, he can’t talk right? You won’t get water in our well from tomorrow. You too don’t come. Come on! Not saying the word mom too. How to handle you son? Prayed to all the Gods and visited all hospitals. You are turning four years in the next three months. I didn’t listen to even one word from your mouth. Come on, show your hands. No idea when will you speak son. Not saying mom too. Doctors say he is not dumb. He doesn’t speak. Oh no! What are you searching for? If you need something and call me, press this. Press it like this. I’ll come. This should always be with you. Understood? -(Bell sound) -What? -Hey, take it. -Hey, this side. Hey, what’s all this nuisance? Are you playing with his bell? I’ll beat you, if you come home again. Maybe God showed mercy by seeing that mother’s pain, the baby started talking. When the baby started turning into a kid, this habit of horn turned into like… Getting late now, need to flirt there with girls right? Hold this, move! Hey, where is the hall ticket? Dude, they may allow into the bus without a ticket but not into the hall without the hall ticket. Go and get it. I know that. See, hall ticket will come now. Oh no, hall ticket! Come on, eat! He will come and take. Oh no, he will get late for the exam. I’m coming son. Did you forget hall ticket, dear? Here! Take it dear. -Keep it in the pocket. -Write the exam carefully, dear.

But lift got heavier after you got in. This interview is very important to me. Can you please get down? I’m getting late. I should go for an interview. I too am going for an interview and not to Inorbit mall. -Madam, can you please get down? -Don’t misunderstand, please! -Hey, congrats! -For what? It’s because you got down fast though you got in last. -Thanks, happy journey. -Hey, thank you! -Good, you have good academics. -Thank you sir! So, can I know what’s your salary expectation? Geetha gets four and Karthik gets six, how much can I ask? Let me go for a toss and then ask. -Excuse me! -Sir! I’ve asked you, what’s your salary expectation? One Million, sir! I see! Ok, you got selected. Congratulation! So, you’ll be receiving your appointment letter very soon. Thank you! Thank you, sir! Baby, what about the interview dear? It’s done, dad. I gave correct answers to everything they asked. I answered confidently as you said, dad. They listened to me well and also said good. -At last they said you’re selected. -What did you say? I got the job, dad. I know you’ll get it, dear. When should you join? They said to follow it up and I’ll get the call letter. -Fine dear, when is your train tonight? -8:30! Go half an hour early, dear. I’ll come and pick at the station in the morning. Ok, dad! I got one Million package. One Million package! How is it possible? -Look Mister! -Dorababu! Look Dorababu! What you know is, you can go to top by believing in the lift. But what you should know is, you can go up in life like me by believing in your brains. How did she come up before me? -Happy journey! -Thank you! You say congrats to me, rascal? Oh no, so fast? Interview is upstairs, I should have taken the number. Press! I’ll make you get down from the lift, idiot. All of you die in the lift. Oh no! Damn! Bloody interview! Huh, move! Come on… Yes! Hey, what is your name? My lawyer is coming and he’ll tell.

Play dude! -Hey, where do you guys stay? -Are you deaf or crazy? My lawyer is coming and he’ll tell. Sir! Yes, got three and the film is on. -(Humming a song) -Namaste sir! (Humming continues) Mr Swamy, which film is this song from? It is haunting me from morning. -I don’t know sir. -Oh, you don’t know? Hey, what about you? We don’t have good knowledge about old films. I didn’t ask about the song, why are you here? My lawyer is on the way. He will tell. -Hey, play dude. -Ok! 15 year old girl and she’s studying 10th class, sir. His dad is doing labour work to give her education. As she didn’t accept when he called, he cut her hand with blade sir. Come on Mr. Swamy, we’ve seen so many cases like this. All the youth are the same these days. Oh wow, you’re doing great. How can you trouble them for this on the name of cases? Move, rascal! It is two and the pawn is dead. -What is this? -Autograph! -For what? -Confession! Our lawyer is coming and he will sign. No! Sir, my name is Kiran. My phone number is 8*******, sir. We stay in Jayanagar 7th block, in 303 of Madhura apartment sir. Sir, my car number is KA 07 ****. In the same car we waited at her school at 11 and with 7’O clock balde… Dirty idiot, this rascal has cut even when I said no, sir. That’s it, sir. Please take that out. Don’t rotate, sir. He’s in pain. Sir, please understand. Not just the ice cream, even the stick isn’t wasted. Your lawyer will come and remove it. Mr Swamy, from which film is this tune? -Sankarabharanam, sir! -Idiot learnt even classical. He can go for Indian Idol. -What? -Time is up, madam. For what? Come on madam, our guys informed to every room. Didn’t they say you? -No! -So, didn’t you watch the TV, madam? Huh! ‘It is going to be a complete lockdown from 12 this midnight.’ ‘And keeping experiences of other countries in mind…’ My baby, those kidnappers, dance school… Drink this water first. Say now. They kidnapped my daughter at Mayuri dance school, sir. -Baby’s age? -Akshara! -Age! -Eight years sir! Are there anyone from your relatives and close ones, who doesn’t like you or envy about you? No sir, there is none as such. It is our responsibility to get your baby back safely. You, give the complaint in writing. -Baby! -Hello! Who are you? She is my wife, sir. She is just giving the complaint. We’ll take the action. You don’t take any action, sir. Let us go. -Come, baby! -What happened, Vasu? -You come, I’ll tell you. -Say Vasu! Kidnappers have called. They’re saying to leave baby if we pay 5 Million. They said to send baby’s corpse if we complain to the Police. -Then, let’s pay 5 Million, Vasu. -Yes! We can earn again if we lose money. -Fine, let’s go. -Hello! You think this is any hotel, to leave after giving order saying not to like the food? Sir, it may be your duty to save our baby. But, our baby is our life. We can’t do anything that puts her in a risk, sir. I beg you! No need! We are not taking action in your baby’s kidnap case. But if you need any help, don’t forget we are here. -Ok sir! -Thank you, sir! -That’s ok! -Thank you! Why did you say so with them, sir? I too have a baby girl, Mr Swamy. I can understand their pain. It’s my responsibility to lie with them for their courage. And it is my duty to save their baby as a Police. -We are taking up this case. -How sir? Like this! Get all the CCTV footage from the area of incident. ‘It is going to be a complete lockdown from 12 this midnight.’ -Baby! -Yes dad! I’m afraid by watching in TV, dear. They are saying trains and busses are closed. How will you come, dear? You don’t worry, dad. There no friends who can say no if I ask for help. I’ll come down, Am I any kid still, dad? -Fine dear, be careful. -Ok, I’ll be in touch on phone. -Fine, see you dear. -Ok, bye! -Hello Arjun! -Say! I sent location of the hotel I’m staying. You should be here in one hour with the car. I should be in my place by 6 AM tomorrow. My photo should be on wall with a lamp underneath if I die with Corona. Go on, say everything. -No dude, listen to me. -You listen to what I say. Spread of novel Corona disease can be stopped. Close the door and sit at home. Shut up and look into your work. You’ll be beaten if you come out and gone if you do too much. -‘Enemies ahead’ -Mom, lemon juice. Lemon Juice! Hey, lemon juice! Hello Santosh! Please think for once. Where can I go alone if you ask me to leave right away? At least one day! They’ll seize our hotel by doing so, madam. We’re extremely sorry, ma’am. There are no transport facilities. Please try to understand. We don’t know all that, madam. Please! -Excuse me, madam. -Huh! There’s a Police station at the dead end of this road. Go there and try. -Maybe you can get some help. -Hah! (Clamouring) -Get us a pass. -We have to be on the road. (Clamouring) -Brother! -Yes! Are there any rooms available nearby to stay? You forgot room address? -No, no! House to stay… -What was that area? He doesn’t know Telugu and I don’t know Kannada. Damn! That guy gave a hand and this guy said some nonsense. I didn’t understand even a word. Why are you stuck so, Chaitra? Say! Congrats, got job it seems? Daddy informed me. They made me vacate the hotel saying lockdown. There are no busses and trains anywhere. I don’t understand what my condition is. Situation is the same even here in Chennai. Why couldn’t you call Arjun? All those are done. No use! -Do you have Bla Bla App in your phone? -What’s that App? It is similar to cabs. If you give your destination, anyone going that way in their own vehicle, they will pick you. -Is it? -Stop wondering and download the App first. If you enter your location and destination, you may get someone coming here from Bangalore. Ok, bye! I will reach my place now. -Hello! -Did you get the ride? -I got, but… -What’s your problem now? Some guy, I don’t know him. So long with a stranger is… Idiot, you got the job. You may have to leave alone for US soon. How can you still have such fears? You say so? Yes! Don’t sit silent and move a bit friendly and close. He’d be down in dreams till you reach here. What if he takes advantage of my behaviour? -Say periods and some other time. -Ok! Hey, that Bla Bla guy is calling. I’ll call you later, bye. Ok fine, bye! Hi, hello! Hah, Lavel road! Yeah, ok! -How much? -200, madam! -200! -Yes, madam! It is not even 5 Kilometres. Yes madam, there’s nothing wrong. It’s wrong. Both you and your auto metre are wrong. -Wait, I’ll just complain to the Police. -Madam, please no! -Madam! -Keep your money, here is a hundred. Huh! Girls like me will not be flat for guys like you. Is my journey going to be with this devil? Is this the Bla Bla fellow? How can I travel with him? -My life is gone now. -Oh no, damn! Let me put a toss and see. She will not come with me, better I start. Hey, stop! I too will come, take me. -Ok! -But there are some conditions. Please say. You shouldn’t stop the bike wherever you wish. You shouldn’t put breaks more often. You shouldn’t talk to me unless required. Mainly, you shouldn’t touch me. Why are you clicking in so many angles like Police for thieves? For safety, to send these to my dad. You don’t need to take me for free. I’ll fill the petrol. Fine, sit! Will she listen when I say no or what? Tell your Google Pay number. -Play camera 1. -Sir! -Play camera 2. -Ok, sir! Stop! -Play from when that spraying vehicle crossed the kid. -Ok sir! -Stop, stop! -Sir! Except one bike, no other vehicle passed from either side after the smoke is out. -Play camera 3 footage. -Sir! -Stop, stop! Back! -Sir! Zoom on to that activa parked there. Zoom in to that mirror up. -Yes, pause! -Sir! Scan that number plate and bring it to me. Fax this bike number to all Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka check posts. -Catch him urgently, wherever he is. -Sure sir! Stop the bike. Why did you put the break? It was a speed breaker and I had to. Not unavoidable, I know by seeing your cunning face. You did it purposefully. You are misunderstanding me. I’m not any kid to do mistakes or to misunderstand. I’ll cut your tail if you do such crazy things again. -Go on! -Am I a monkey to cut the tail? Cuts my tail it seems, huh! Oh no, speed breaker is here again. What’d she say if I put break and what if I don’t? Let me believe in God! Oh no! Don’t you know to put break? You said not to put sudden break. Don’t pretend so innocent. You did this purposefully. -No! -I understood. You feel I’ve no other option than your bike in this lockdown, right? Your over action and ego are because of this bike, right? Come on, say! I’ve your Google Pay number, right? I’ll do it. -No, Chaitra! -Not Chaitra, it is Chaitra madam! Will this bike cost 50K? No way, 35K is big for this bike. -Check it, this bike is mine from this moment. -Ok! You are just the driver. You should listen to me from now. Understood? Move now. -Hello, what is this? -What’s there? Behave like a driver. Clean it. -Not there, but here. -Aah! Please sit! Hello! Where shall I bring? Where shall I come in Khajipet, sir? Sir, we are coming directly to you with total 5 Million. Please be careful with the baby, sir. Ok sir! To hell with this life! A quarter of liquor is costing one thousand because of Corona. I’ll munch down this corona with drink if I see it. It is ringing. Why is he calling at this time? -Hello! -Hey dude! -Say! -Is Corona a male or female? -What, is Corona male or female? Come on, say it dude. Corona is a female, man. Not just that, anything torturing in this world is female. Yes, he confirmed it. Leave that, will male mosquitos sip human’s blood? No! Only the female mosquitos sip it. Did you see Jurassic park film? The tall ones eating leaves in that are all male. I said, right? Come on, give the money. Hey, this money is brought for feed of the cattle. Those cruel and eating humans are all female ones. It was even recently found in research that just the male trees are the good ones. -Hey dude, thanks! -Come on, have it all. I got a quarter of liquor with your support. Come carefully, dude. Police will beat you up, if caught. You have this cloth over your head now. It will set well for you. Is Corona female? But, it is not cunning like you. Oh no, so she heard everything. I’m dead now. Hey, stop! It’s wet mud here, take a bit ahead. Huh, she’s torturing. Where are you coming? I too believe in God. I’ll also pray to God. Fine, you can go after I come. Keep watching my shoe. Come on, don’t joke. Who’ll steal the shoe here? “Thieves here, be careful” You know what, elders say our bad time will be gone if we lose shoe at a temple. That is for guys like you. Those are Zara. Will you skid wearing these? -They cost 15K. -What, 15K? 15K for shoe? Should I guard these now? What’s special in this? 15K for these? You’d get half a sovereign of gold. 15K it seems, God! -Are you thirsty? -Say, you are thirsty. -Answer just to what I asked. -Yes! Then stop somewhere and take a water bottle. Ok fine, I can’t anyways escape. No idea where can I get a water bottle now. Please get down. Let’s try if we can get it here. Hello! Do you have a water bottle? Yes, we have. You need cooling or normal? Normal, bro! Give one! -What are you watching for? -Change! You won’t get any change. Each bottle costs a hundred. Why hundred for water bottle bro, it’s 20 right? That was before lockdown and it is lockdown now. Why hundred if it is a lockdown? -You need it or no? -Huh! A loss of one hundred for me! Water is costing equal to a quarter now. Why did you make me buy when you had a water bottle already? This is mine. I don’t like you watching at me when I’m drinking and me offering it. Thus, I made you buy your own water bottle. Huh! Come on, sit! “This baby with beautiful eyes” “Is killing me with her nuisance” “She traps with her cross looks” “She’s gambling by doing some magic” “She’s hidden her secret” ‘She isn’t allowing to cross limits” “She’s hidden her secret” ‘She isn’t allowing to cross limits” “She’s active at once” “She’s absent minded again” “She’s the peace turning a cyclone in one hour” “This baby with beautiful eyes” “Is killing me with her nuisance” Two minutes, I’m talking to mom. “Lady devil without sharp teeth putting fire pretending cool” “Even flowery way turns into thorny path when you step in” “Hey, nightmare spoiling a good night sleep” “It’s pleasant thought you scream with that metallic sound” “How do I say why I like though you torture me so?” “Even Kalidas will put aside his pen and salute with no comparisons” “Baby with strawberry lips has looted my heart” “This naughty babe has snatched my breath away” “This baby with beautiful eyes” “Is killing me with her nuisance” Driver, I’m getting a call. Stop the vehicle. -Hello! -Did you start, dear? Did you call to check how I’d go without you? Or did you call with a concern over me? Nothing as such, I called to apologise. -Why? What was your car? -Hundai i10, brand new! -I 10? -Yeah! -Driver, what’s our car? -Kia! -Oh, i20? -Oh no! -I20, it seems! -I’m really sorry. Huh! No problem, these are all common in friendship. This is all because of these post Covid trauma symptoms. Ok, when are you arriving for the festival? I’ll come immediately once this three day lockdown is over. Then, don’t call me at all then. Fine, let me spray to this. Won’t he help when this Chaitra asked for help? Playing games with me? -Sit! -Wow, nature is so great. Driver, click a photo. This is an added service for me again! Move a bit this side. You’d look good if you can smile a bit. Babe is glowing like a raisin. Will you come, babe? -Come on, say! -Hey! You go on, man! Stop, stop! Did you listen to how those idiots commented? It’s common for guys to comment and students to do ragging. We shall be kind hearted and adjust. Are you really a human? Even I got the same doubt after I started my journey with you. Will you be so when a girl is commented? Will you stop your sarcasm now? What if they had commented your friends? Come on, my friends have been cheating me from the first. Who’d risk for those idiots? What if they commented your sister? No way, none was born before or after me. So, I don’t know how that emotion would be. -What if I was your lover? -This is the correct emotion. Fine, think I’m your lover for 10 minutes. What’ll you do then? I won’t say, I’ll show. Come on, idiots. -Come on, say! -Sister, I touched unknowingly. -Sorry! -Sorry, sister! -What did you say, idiot? -I said nothing, sister. -Sandwich massage? -No sandwich or samosa! -Come on, touch! -No sister, please! I beg you sister, please no! What did you say, idiot? Raisin! -Sorry sister! -Will you comment any girl again? -If you comment girls anywhere again… -No sister! All Indian women are my sisters, sister. -Go! -Thanks sister! -Move, man! Leave, idiots! What’s wrong? Your 10 minutes is over. Come and start the bike, driver. Oh no, she’s a monster. Move! What? What did you say about my background for them to fear so much? Oh, that one! Hero came to take revenge, dropping his babe to a side. Who tried to touch that girl saying babe just now? -It’s me! -Did your hand touch her hand? -What if touched? -Did your hand touch her hand? What if it touched, idiot? Get tested if touched bro, we both have Corona. -You know where are we coming from? -Where? We’ve escaped from quarantine centre. Quarantine centre, it seems dude! -Not just that. If you don’t apologise now, I’ll touch. -No bro! -I’ll sneeze, cough! -No, stay away. No! Come on, sit. Huh! No problem, dad. I’m coming in friend’s car. Nothing like shown in TV, dad. There are no Police anywhere. You don’t be tensed. It looks like a Police check post. Dad, I’ll call you later. We’re caught now. Show your ID card. Park to a side. How should I escape now? Come on! Stop that vehicle. Hey, move aside. Why did you come on to this route? Why couldn’t you take some side road like before? Hey, get down. Come on, move. There’s only one road from the past 10 kilometres. -Can’t you understand? -What to do now? -Come out! -Don’t you know not to come out in lockdown? -I even have the pass, sir. -Take it out. -What, sir? -Come to a side. Oh no, why is he coming towards me? Did he find out? He’s coming. Hey, come on move. Give way to the Ambulance behind. Clear fast, Ambulance is coming. Come on, go! Give way to Ambulance. Come on, move. Go! Sir, this bike number was there in the vehicles we just let go just now along with the Ambulance. Damn, we let go in front of our eyes sir. -Is it? Did you see properly? -True sir, I saw it. -I should talk on phone urgently, please. -Damn! Do whatever! -Are you done? -Sorry, I was talking to my mom. -Stop it, move now. -Ok! Hello! Sir, I’m Venkateswarlu SI at Andhra border. Bike with the number you faxed just crossed our check post, sir. -Mr Swamy! -Sir! Snake is out now. Balance is to catch it like an eagle now. Nothing will happen to baby, Bhargavi. Be strong! We shall pay the money and bring our baby back. Hey driver, stop! -What happened? -Shades fell down. Go and get them. They fell down because of you. Go and get them. Don’t raise so much. Wire may break down. Princess is here to pass orders! Don’t mess with Chaitra, huh! -Oh no! -Hey! Oh no, beautiful spects have broken down. Madam’s heart might have been broken down. Oh no, are you feeling bad? Still, why to feel bad for this? Sixth shop in the third lane beside our Amalapuram clock tower, our Pawan opticals! He obeys whatever I say. You go there and call me. He’ll give you the best. Do you know about these spects? You are feeling so bad, means it must be a sentiment for you. Your granny gave your mom and she gave it to you, right? -Please take it. Celebrate with this. -No! Why is that tension, Mr Swamy? I’m afraid thinking about what you’d do once you catch the kidnapper, sir. It’s enough that we donate our fear to the kidnappers. Any guy should shake to think about such a mistake ever again. Why are the Police here again? I’m caught now. Where are you coming from? Where is your mask? Don’t you know you shouldn’t coming during lockdown time? Where are you going? Sir, no answer for any questions asked. Oh no, sir! Hey, stop idiot! Hey, stop! Hey no, my bag! Go fast, come on run! Run! Come on, come fast. Run fast, he’s coming. Run fast and sit. He’s coming, came closer. -Hey, stop! -Go! Go! He was almost caught and went missing. Thank God, we escaped. -Will you please get down? -Why did you stop the bike? I’m feeling very drowsy. You get drowsy and dozed off by drinking heavily. Why are you treating me like a drunkard as I’m quiet? -Huh, no drunkard would accept. -You’re talking the same again. I already said you shouldn’t stop the vehicle wherever you wish. My mom and dad are waiting at home for me. If I drive the bike in this condition now and dash to some tree, no more waiting but just the last looks. It is waste to argue with you. Will you start the bike now or not? I won’t start. Where are you going? We’re going to home town because of lockdown, sir. -Which place? -Vijayawada, sir. -Where are you coming from? -We’re coming from Bangalore, sir. -Hey Constable, check it. -Ok sir! Open the boot. -Is there anything? -Nothing, sir! Are you coming from Nalla Mangalam? We came in the same route, sir. -Can we start sir? -Ok, go! Aren’t you feeling hungry? What, water bottle technique again? No, I’m really feeling hungry. You’ve been uploading something or the other in every gap. I mean, when you’ve been hungry why not me? Wait, I’ll just be back. -Where? -To go and place an order in Swiggy. Will you eat that or what? China man spread Corona by eating all such things. -He got you linked to me. -What? -Have it, good organic food. -Oh no! Sleeping like a buffalo! Is he really asleep? You frightened me. When you get frightened seeing such a beautiful girl, won’t I be afraid in a place with scorpions and centipedes crawling around? What do you want me to do? You can’t book if I need a room now, right? Set another place. Uff! He crossed the check post by the time we saw fax this morning, sir. There is even a girl along with him, sir. Where else did they go without crossing next check post when they crossed this check post? -Come down carefully, give your hand. -No need! Please sit! I set it up great, right? I should put him in control first to bear with his extras. Oh no, I’m feeling cold. What’s this? They said in some English film to never trust a man at night. I’d have slept right there if this was the case. Don’t sleep alone when you are outside. Did that English film guy say this one too? No, my dad said it. Should I ask her like teacher at school if I get toilet now? Oh no, who is this now? Chaitra madam! -What? -I’m getting a call, can you lift? They’d think you’ve slept. Sleep! They said in a Malayalam film to never miss a call at midnight. Please! -Should I take it out or not? -Not down, but at the top. Yes Loki, tell me! It seems you said about some site recently to Rakesh, right dude? -Which site, man? -That site! -What that site, idiot? -Boys and girls romancing… Cut it, Chaitra madam. Cut it, please. You said never miss a call at midnight from some Malayalam film, right? -Go on, talk! -Oh, did I say so? -Come on dude, say. -I didn’t say him anything, -Call him, man. -He isn’t lifting the call. -Search in Google. -Google is showing same old ones. Say the new one, man. I’ll kill you if you don’t cut the call, rascal. Hang it! I did good by tying your hands, damn! -Say it, dude! -Oh no! Dirty idiot, you ruined everything with just one phone call. Never miss a call in the midnight! Damn, you idiot! Huh, dirty mosquitoes! She tied my hands made me go helpless even to scratch. Why did you stop again? You shouldn’t forget to look forward as God gave you the luck to sit at the back, Chitra madam. Have a look. Blow the horn then. Poor creatures doesn’t know to stop at red light, move on green light and give way when horn is blown. Then you go and drive them to a side. I’m driver for just this vehicle and not your servant. If needed, you go and drive them away. -Me? -Yes! Girls are animal lovers, right? No problem, go. -Damn that I asked you. -Go! Don’t say to buy them like this bike. Shhh! Move! That expression is to drive away chicken and not the cows. Go! Go, go! Please go! Are you too high in fat like this fellow? Not just him, everything is a problem being with him. Damn! Please, go! Don’t damage my prestige in front of him. Please! Please! Go, go! -See! -Huh! There’s no work Chaitra can’t do. We got him, sir. Ok! Where can he escape, Mr Swamy? There should be no question without answer and criminal not caught by Police in this world. Sir! This idiot brought me and got caught to Police. What if dad knows about this? I’ll take care. You go. -Sir! -Huh, sit! -Who are you guys? -Students, sir. -Where are you coming from? -Gudise, sir! -Why are you scolding? -That is name of a place sir. Oh, what was your work there? That is my granny’s place, sir. You want me to believe that you aren’t coming from Bangalore and crossed any check post, right? -Is it so? -Yes, sir! -What? -Arya, sir! -I didn’t ask about the song. Who is the girl? -Lover, sir. -So, you both are deep… -I’m confirming no as you may think, sir. Ok! Don’t you know not to roam out during lockdown time? -I know, sir. -Came out with the girl knowingly? -It was a bit urgent, sir. -What was so urgent? -Granny died in the village, sir. -Granny, RIP! -Whose granny? -His! -Her! This is called as hit wicket in cricket. And in football, self… -Self-goal sir! -Yes, self-goal! -I want truth. What’s your name? -Chaitra, sir. -Chitra! -Not Chitra, Chaitra sir. Why are you silent? What’s she to you? She’s nothing to me sir. We met casually in the past, became friends usually, separated accidentally, this morning met coincidentally and while travelling together… Say in Telugu, man. It was three months friendship until six months back, sir. I didn’t know her and she didn’t know me before that, sir. Though I knew who she is and she knew who I was in these six months, as we got one phone call as being strangers… Oh no, I’m not understanding though you said it in Telugu. You don’t understand when told, you’ll understand by seeing sir. Look that way for once. Is your child episode a bonus for me like that no smoking Ad in theatres? When asked about your story, it is not to say from childhood. Then, shall I say from the time I became an adult? Yes, say that first you donkey. You said to call that Bombay guy, did you call? Why are you taking away when we are drinking, idiot? Sir, why are you here? Namaste, sir! Yes, wherever you go I, Police follows. Like a dog! If you start from bar, we should put the scrolling, “drinking is injurious to health” and remove brand labels over the bottles. -Rascal, start the story from elsewhere. -Ok sir! -I didn’t like him, remove. -I’ll remove him, sir. Our power star… Kalyan! “Ganesh Chaturdhi Greetings!” Pawan Kalyan is our God! -Give the phone. -Hail to power star! What idiot, was that not a theatre? Was it a temple? I thought power star’s film release by seeing your actions. Somehow we get a trance just by listening to his name, sir. -Correct! It’s a celebration with power star around. -Yes sir! No matter if it is a school or a temple. Ok, continue! (Kabaddi chanting) Hey Raju, that PJ idiot tore our flex put up at Mahalaxmi temple. -That rascal is dead today. -Stop dude, stop! Why are you hissing like a cobra? Cool down. -Are you coming or not? -I’ll somehow put that back, dude. -Sit on the back, come on. -No dude, please listen. -At least you say him. -Hey, move aside. We shall close this today. What to close? We’ll be gone by messing with him. -We can’t leave this so. -I beg you, stop the bike. -Hey, stop it idiot. -Not me, you stop! Hey, get down if you are afraid. Oh no, please stop man. No please. Why is your flex at the temple built by my grandfather? -Hey, no dude! -We shall close this today. -Hey, stop the bike. -What’s wrong, sir? Who is this fellow in between like a joker in cards? He’s our village PJ named Velgapudi Venkataratnam. -PJ, what’s that? -Pilla Jamindar (Junior landlord)! Oh, what does he do? He contested as our village President and lost with 2 votes. Oh no! 2 votes, so lost very narrowly. -Did you understand so? -Yeah! Losing with 2 votes means, he just got 2 votes. There were three in the visuals, how can he get just 2 votes? He’s crazy about cock fights. Opponent got cock symbol, he cast his vote on that. -What’s this craze for this idiot? -Not just this, there are many more. What are they? He gets busy in cock fights during Pongal. He’s busy in playing cards before and after that. He shifts to IPL when summer is on. And why will he be alone when winter is on? He spends all the money won yearlong at this. Damn you, stop it! It is a time waste about this rascal, say what’s next. -No dude, please. -Shut up or get down idiot. No dude, let go. Please listen to me. Will you break his leg now as he cut your hand in the flex? -Dude, please cool down. -We shall close this today. -You sit silently, rascal. -Go slowly, dude. -Hey, drive carefully. -Dude, please listen. Hey, Police guys have clicked a photo too. -Hey stop! -Hey, Police, dude! -Hey stop! -Oh no, are you going to kill him or kill us? There, he clicked yet another photo. -Hey, go slowly. I beg you. -I beg you, dude. Please dude, it is wrong route! We can’t go like this in one way. No, Police guy clicked yet another photo. -Let him click. -I didn’t have so many photos even in my marriage. -It should end today. -No speed please, it’s wrong route dude. He dashed them. Oh no, stop it dude please. Stop the bike man. I can’t bear you, I’m getting down. -You rascal! -Get down, I’ll tell you. My bad man, I informed you unnecessarily. It’s dry up and wet down. We’ll go by auto. Come on, man. -Come on! -Go idiots. Not him, I shall scold you. Nothing can hide in your mouth, rascal. -Sir! -What was that driving? What happened, sir? -You know the traffic violations you just did? -What did I do? -Five signal jumps, over speeding, triple riding… -Ok! -No helmet, added is wrong route driving! -Ok! -You know what will be the total fine? -How much? It’d be more than 5000 after adding my fees of 500. -Whose bike do you think is this? -Whose is this? Come on sir, I’ll tell. Hey, stop! Won’t you wear helmets? This bike number looks familiar. Hey, you know who I am? -Hey, say him guys. -Come and park the bike to a side. -Sir! -Come on! Pay the fine first and then take your bike. What’s a fine of 5000? I have nothing to do with this, I won’t pay. You don’t pay the fine after jumping signals? -What’s me jumping signals? -Pay 6000 and it’ll be done. -Here, take it. Give me the keys. -Yes! -Did you stick his number? -Yes! Fine I put him for tearing 500 worth flex of mine is 5000. -This is my style. -Cute boy! -Hello! -Where are you? -I‘m in the shop. -PJ came to know you’re behind that 5000 fine. -What? -Yes, he is coming to you. Better vanish! -Hey! -Play a good card, dude. Hello! Not a card, should finish this bloody gambler first. “Mahalaxmi bike mechanic shop” -Brother! -What, dude? Look down for once. Oh no, there are ten guys inside. You go and open it. He got ready for the war even before stepped in. If we get caught now, our cock will turn into kebab. It is not like we lost a match when a six is hit. Even the opponent will have the chance to bat. We will get our chance too. Let’s go! Let’s look into his matter later. They have left now, go and look into your work. Timid idiot! No! Why did you keep the mirror here? It’s me! Huh, always the same! You don’t encourage new talents. You did that well. Still do we need your introductions after the intermission? You are the first person who asked about me, other than my mom and friends, sir. Thus I got into emotion and am trying to say this like a biopic, sir. I’ll tell if that is a biopic and horror pic. First say where did you see her. She looks so innocent and traditional. Oh no, did it die? Thank God! Oh no! Did it die? Thank God! Hail to Lord Venkateswara! You’re dead now. Hail to Lord Venkateswara! They are approaching. Stop! Wow, she is like modern Mother Teresa. I feel like saluting just by looking at her. -Watch it completely and then say, sir. -Jealousy fellow! You go on to the tree now. Oh God, why did she kill it like that? You bite Chaitra? Huh! Why did you show villain introduction saying to show the heroine? -Bloody lady, she’s a psycho! -Sir please no, this is a temple. -Sorry! -Please move. “Is it possible to link a chisel and the statue?” “Can friendship with her turn into love?” “Is it possible to link a chisel and the statue?” “Can friendship with her turn into love?” -Sneha, have you studied? -I’ll be college topper now. “She’s churning my thoughts and breath turned into a cyclone” “No bounds to my happiness and no limits now” Let me read what’s written? Should Sneha fail in exam? “Shall I hide this beautiful Konaseema in my heart?” “She is the green crop and shall I be the field?” “At the time travelling in the wrong way” “She is seen to me like the boat in the river” “Is it a hesitation making me go silent?” “Or an excitement making me breathless” “Is it a doubt I’m unable to clarify” “Or a tough time unable to express” “Did God turn tremendous beauty into her?” “Did he put a ladder and send her down slowly?” “I’m turning into a breeze running all around the village” “She tied a thread with looks and made me follow her” -Song is very good, man. -Thanks, sir! We will reach the location in 15 minutes, sir. -Sir! -What? -They are coming in 15 minutes to the location. -Fine, go! -You just have 15 minutes now. -Why is that, sir? You finish the story in these 15 minutes. You have always been behind her. Isn’t she into action? -I too got the same feeling, sir. Thus… -What? -It’s done. I won’t stop now even if you say. -What? -I mean, it will not stop now even if you say. -Oh! Please take it. You said it won’t stop? -Heart bolt got loose, madam. -What? I mean, corroborator bolt was loose and I tightened it. -It won’t stop now. -Ok, here! You can give it when you come tomorrow. Why will I come tomorrow? I mean, you can give next time when you come. -No problem, have it. -Ok, madam. -Adulterated petrol, madam! -I see! Why is she looking at me so seriously? Did she get to know? It is done, madam. Ok madam! “Mahalaxmi bike mechanic shop” -Hey, give 13-14 wrench. -Here! Why did you give this when I asked for wrench? Oh no, sir! Bike is coming back repeatedly for repair means you did something else than repairing. What did you do? -I purposefully made the corroborator bolt loose sir. -Why? I’m going behind her every day, thought to have a feeling of her too coming behind me, sir. Do one thing, marry her. Then you both can do together. All these trials are for the same, sir. Didn’t she get a doubt over your trials? Did she believe it all? No sir, she sold off the bike. -Oh no, poor girl! -Yes! What do you think? I made him hit a six. -Dude, is it a new mobile? It is shining. -See! Where did you get it? Dhoni hit a six yesterday and a guy mortgaged this to me. -What if Dhoni gets out? -He’d mortgage it tomorrow. -Is the bike ready? -Yes uncle, it is ready. -How much? -No problem, have it. -Take it, dude! -No problem, uncle. -Have it, uncle. -Why don’t you take, dude? -Come on, dude! -Give it here. -He took it. -You have a great man. Have you come for a marriage to get it for free? Go now. He does everything great for all. But not for me. What’s wrong, dude? It is been six months since I asked to look for a good bike. He still hasn’t arranged. Dude, setting a good bike is like fixing a marriage match. Did you understand? -Like caste and religion, we shall look for company and model for a bike. -Yes! -For background check, we shall see mileage and number of users. -Yes! You don’t need to see now. I’ve set it myself. You just come, check and say how it is. Have you set it? Where? -In OLX. -In OLX? Oh no! -Don’t you know? -Why not? Food comes in half an hour when ordered. -That is our knowledge. -I think they changed the name. You close the shutter and come. I got something to talk, come on. What man, why do you care about OLX? You’ll get your commission right? Why couldn’t you get a bike for that poor guy? Sir, I didn’t like you coming in between the scene instead of coming at the end. Enough of this over action, he looks to be an innocent guy. Huh, no idea how will he live. -Is this dotted design yours? -Turn over and see! Oh, is it a chariot design? It is good. Why is nobody here? This looks to be a bike of my girl. -It looks great, dude. -Call them. Excuse me! Hello! It is our bike. -Wow, she looks great. -Bike is here. Why is this fellow here? -Bike in OLX! -Yes! Wow, engine is great. It hasn’t washed out at all. Is it single hand driving? Wow, eyes are dazzling great. One can’t turn away the looks. -What eyes? -That might be head lights. Correct! I never thought you’d understand me so fast. Seat looks great. -Which seat are you talking about? -Bike seat! -What’s the price you set in OLX? -30,000! Damn, is this bike 30K? We won’t take for even one buck less than 40K. -What dude? -30 is high for this and why do you say 40K? Idiot, see with my eyes. You’d feel even 40K is less. You and your dirty misery! Come on, take out the money. -No, I won’t give. -Idiot doesn’t know the value of bike. -You please have it. -Did you get close so fast? -One, two, three… -He and his over action! Did I set it great? -I’m taking the bike. You come by walk. -Hey! -Sir! -Don’t search, I’m not here. -Hey, stop! -Where is sir? -Minister is my uncle. -Sir, it seems he is Minister’s aid. Minister’s aid? He’s close to us. Take 200 extra and let him go. Who’d look after collection here, if I’m there? So, you finally have fixed to go for a love marriage. -Everyone these days is getting in to a love marriage, sir. -How? -If a success, he marries his lover. -Ok! -When failed, he marries lover of another guy. -Oh! Great logic, man! You’d anyways not let go anybody when you decide to collect. -Stop your satires and tell the story. -Ok sir! Sir, he always tells about himself as hero. I’ll tell about his zero side. Hey cool! Cool baby, cool! Go on! -Hello, where are you? -Did she see me or not? Hey, I’m calling you. Remove your shirt. Come on, remove the shirt. -Remove it. -It doesn’t look good here, dude. -Remove it fast. -I’m almost done. Why man? Why do you need my shirt? -Hey dude! -Go! Hey Raju! It’s been a week since I gave my Boxer bike for repair. I’m talking to you, idiot. Hey Raju! Neither you are seen at shed n nor is my bike. By chance, did you mortgage my bike or what? Hey Raju, that Boxer bike is a sentiment for my family. Take one Paracetamol in the morning and evening. It’ll be down in 2 days. -Fine, go! -Raju, what did I ask and what did you say? -Raju, hey! -He and his dirty Boxer! -Hey Fundoo! -Sir! -Sir! -Did you turn Doctor from mechanic? -That is sir… -It is not shirts to change. -But her heart. -Ok! -Focus! Ok sir! Crazy idiot! Oh no, it is Corona time now. She is coming. -(Cuckooing) -Why did this cock come in the middle? I love you. Cock’s feathers are out. She slapped on that cheek, flowery shirt idiot. Fine, how did that Cock connect to this girl? -Even that is because of a cock, sir. -How? She’s taking such great care of our cock in fever and how great would she look after you? -You say so, dude? -Your couple will be great. -It really would be great. -Yes! To hell with his cocks craziness! -Still, he is correct in a way. -Positive angle in you is a bit high, sir. Is there any negative angle in her, by chance? I can’t say sir. You watch yourself. What’s there? She’s at a campfire. Oh no, is she frying the cock? Sadist lady! Like Doctors operating stealing the kidneys, you gave first aid to the cock and turned it into kebab and ate it away? My goodness! -I’ve been saying the same from first, sir. -Hey, stop it. -Why do you intervene when I’m talking? -Stop it, man. I’m saved. Cartoon! -Sir! -They said in so many films. They wrote in so many books. Love only if you have the dare or be quiet. This holy land is full of sacrifices from many lovers. I didn’t understand, sir. What is to give a flower and love, you fool? I did great plans than what you said, sir. But a lizard came by then and ruined my plans. -So brutal! -Yes sir. -Actually what happened? -Ok! Fine, let’s chat while sipping the toddy. I won’t drink toddy, but will give you a company. Come on, sir! -Yes, I got the card. -Oh no! -What’s wrong, dude? -Lizard fell on my head. Did lizard fall? Right or left? On the left! -Then, you’re gone. -What? -Yes dude, right is fine but shouldn’t fall on the left. -Oh no! Prasad from next village fell down under a vehicle when lizard fell on him. -He’s gone. -Gone! Why are you saying like a priest knowing it all? Guys like you believe only when the priests says. They won’t believe if we say. There is the priest coming. -Priest sir! -Priest sir! -What, man? -He came in time. -Hey, she just came out. -You say it is ok? -I’m frightened, dude. -Are you frightened? -What would happen? -She is coming. She’s coming, dude. She’s coming. She has come. -Hey, do you have any sense? -Madam, sorry! I didn’t do purposefully. He pushed me, madam. What the priest said was in real… What exactly happened was… -Priest sir, please stop. -Please stop. -Please stop! -What guys? I should go by the time planets move. Stop sir, we fear about our friend’s planets here. -What happened? -Lizard fell on my head. -Lizard! On the right or left? -On the left. Left side? What are the planets saying, sir? -They are waiting for his arrival. -What do you mean? He’ll go up. -Didn’t I say? -Please say, if there’s a solution. -Why not, it’s always there. -Thank God! If you go and touch someone who already touched the golden lizard in Kanchi. Subbayamma of Ramalayam street had recently been to Kanchi and touched the golden lizard. For your solution, first go touch Subbayamma and then come to me, get rituals done and it all goes well. Priest said to touch Subbayamma and not to hold me. -Sorry madam. -Don’t try to say stories still. Damn! Get going. -Hey! Hey! -Sir! Idiot, will you hold the girl to touch with a sentiment of lizard? -That was sir… -Silence, don’t act. -This is to touch and this is to hold. -Ok! -Say what you did? -I caught her, sir. -Police! Run away. -Oh no, Police! Sir, thieves should escape listening to Police siren and why are you running? Police or my foot! I set up a check post to earn some money. -So, are you a fake Police? -Yes! How did you set it up like that, sir? They set up SPF branch itself in Chennai. This is nothing. Even you’ll be pushed into quarantine getting caught to Police. Run away. You gave great build up like the real Police, sir. Please accept his love. Great song is playing at the right time. -Run away! -Oh no, run! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! See, my entire dress is dirtied because of you. Will you apologise to me or not? Why are you feeling so problematic when it can be cleaned after going home? This is a problem for me. Will you apologise or not? Why should I say sorry? Why? You took me in wrong route yesterday, did you say sorry? I brought you food when you were hungry. Did you say thanks to me then? -Should sorry it seems, huh! -Oh, are you talking logics now? You are screaming so as you feel I can’t go without you, right? When did I scream, I was just saying. You don’t need to say anything now. Let’s go our own ways from here. -No Chaitra madam! -You don’t need to say anything. Let me die on my own and you live to yourself. -Not that, please! -Go! Go on! -Fine, up to you! -Hello, it is my bike. Oh, yes! It is yours. Please go. Please Chitra madam! Fine, I’m sorry. Wow! Hey, stop. Look at those waterfalls. Come on! Hello! Hey driver! -What, madam? -You wait there. -For what? -My dress is dirtied because of you. I should fresh up. You go and wait there. -Driver! -What again? Keep your phone there and go. -There’s no charging in this. -I’ve got no trust on you. Princess is nothing less in these idiotic thoughts. -Driver! -What again, madam? -Keep talking while you go. -Why, madam? I’ll know how far have you gone when you go talking. Go! -You’ve got great brains, madam. -That’s what Chaitra is rich in. You go now. -Fine, it is tough to win over you. Just a small change! -What? -Talking is tough, can I sing songs? -Do whatever! -It is the first time you said ok to me. -Go on! -(Singing a song) -Driver, can you change the song? Ok! (Singing another song) -Hey, babe is very fresh. -Raju! -Raju! My name is driver, right? -Raju! -Come on, it is not me. -Raju! One, two and three. We are already three here. Do you still need a fourth guy, baby? Hey, who are you guys? Why did you bring us here? I’m asking you guys, come on say. What will they say when you ask them? I’ll tell. -Hey Bombay. -I was Bombay then. It’s Mumbai now. Whom did you ask and bring? I didn’t bring, she came herself through Bla Bla. I’m not asking about whom you made sit, but about what you sat on. So, you put a slip and get the bike? -So, is that not your bike? -No! Don’t you have shame to sell a bike to me at 35K, which wasn’t yours? When did I sell? You didn’t let me speak a word and forced asking to say the number. Every thief getting caught would talk the same way. Huh! Will you stop your Tom and Gerry romance now? You should do something for getting my bike without asking me. What is that? -Hey! -Did you kidnap? They say the same in English. What guys? -It is wrong, idiot. -No way out, man! They advise when asked for help. They say interest if asked for a loan. All these mistakes are as I’m unable to repay those debts. It is wrong to make others suffer for your needs. Oh! Is it correct to take my bike for your need? I fixed to kidnap even after knowing I’d be a fool if I do a mistake and get caught. I did rekey, planned not to leave any evidences, kidnapped by picking that girl on this bike. I hid it cleverly as this was the only evidence available. Thought all went as planned and to be happy as I’d get money in some time. You came and rode away with this bike. With a fear I’d get caught if you get caught, followed behind you in Ambulance and chased like a mad dog on the roads. For you to realise my troubles, you go and bring that kidnap money. If you say routine dialogues not to get it… -I should routinely say her chastity and the kid’s life will be gone. -Sit idiot! Don’t try anything different, differences may come here. -Hello! -Hello! I came to the said place with money. Good, go a bit ahead from where you are standing. Bend you head a bit and look down. -What is there? -There is a dustbin. No, it says use me. Put money in that and use that. -What about my baby? -Trust me! It is my responsibility to make the girl practice in dance school. Hello! Hello! Damn! Dirty rascal! Didn’t I say, he is capable? He’d bring money if he goes. -Give the bag, Raju. -First let the baby and Chaitra go. I’m your friend, dude. Don’t you believe me? I don’t believe as you are my friend. -Give the bag. -Release the kid. Give the bag. You rascal! You rascal! Finish him, guys. Hey Bombay! -Sir, sir! -It is you who did it. But who asked you to do it? Who? Though we said no for your help in fear, many thanks as you investigated and caught the kidnappers, sir. -That’s my duty. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you so much. -We’ll take leave, sir. It’s ok. Why are you leaving without knowing who the key planner is, Mrs Bhargavi? Sir! Vasu, sir! Vasu! What happened, Vasu? Yes, I planned this kidnap. But, not to harm baby or to do something to you. I lost money in IPL betting. I took debts for that. I got stuck deeply by the time I realised my mistake. I finally was into a position to beg from you even for 10K. They threatened to take my life if I don’t repay their debt. But I felt what you’d think if I ask you for 5 Million. I got into a deal for half a Million with kidnappers. Everything went as I planned till the kidnap took place. But entire story went wrong when she came and complained you. Human may change many colours, but shadow always remains black. Though a thief acts any better, he does a small mistake to get caught. After we decided to involve in this case, we first traced the bike number from CCTV footage. What about the next move? As kidnappers already called father of the girl, we may get their number if we check his call list. Yes sir! There wasn’t a call from any new number after the girl got kidnapped means, it is a lie that kidnappers called and asked for money. We got doubt then on you for the first time, sir. I asked to tap your phone. As we can get the final destination by tracing where the money goes, I made them place mobile tracker in the money bag at the check post on your way. Thus, Raju coming for money got caught. -Where is the girl? -Sir, I don’t know anything. They locked my friend and threatened to bring the money bag, sir. I don’t know anything, sir. -I don’t encourage fairy tales. -Please believe me, sir. -You should do as I say to believe you. -I’ll do sir. -Thanks Raju. -Thank you sir. -Thank you sir. -Careful! -See you, sir. -Ok! -Mr Swamy! -Sir! -Check for a good and strong case. -Ok sir. -Sir! Is it you? -No man, it is my dupe. Come on sir, why are you here? I seized a guy’s car for travelling in lockdown. It broke down in between and seized me down. Why did you stop the love story in between and leave? What can you do knowing that? Forget that, sir. -We should go very long still. -Where will you go? You said a half and she said a quarter. I’m not getting a kick even by having a full, without knowing your love story completely. -Say it. -Leave it, sir. Remembering a few makes us happy, forgetting some would leave us in pain. Mine is the second feeling in this matter, sir. -So, in love… -Should fear for doing mistake and not as that fell out. Nothing wrong to think what you see is true. But don’t think what you can’t see are lies. That’s a big mistake. It is wrong. Every guy is so. He is a saint till he gets caught and a conman after getting caught. These girls put blames as easily as they wear jewellery, sir. The guy bearing them will know the pain from those blames. It will be very heavy. Doing mistakes and trying to escape again is a birth habit for men, right? Stop your bloody face book quotations. What’s the pain he can’t forget and the mistake you can’t excuse? I should know. Yes! Chaitra madam, hello! -Wait a minute, please. -Move aside! Listen to me for a minute. -Chai… -Stop it now. Will you catch me as I didn’t say anything when you followed? -Listen to what I’m saying. -You listen to me first. Girls like me will not fall for guys like you. Look at your hands, so dirty. I don’t even eat food sitting with guys like you. And how did you think I’d fall in love with you? -What is your name? -Raju (King)! For which kingdom? Do you know the value of that name? Some idiotic name would be better for this mechanic job you do. You don’t suit yourselves to your name. Do you know what my education is? 560 in my tenth standard, I was school first. 955 in inter, I was college first. I’m University topper in my B Tech. I’d even get a job with a package suitable to my range in six months. Still, you won’t understand all these. These are problems of a bad parenting. Has your mother gone any mute? You wouldn’t be so if she had slapped you hard while studying. Still, it won’t come for any Tom, Dick and harry. It is just a matter of one second to give or not to give respect. There’d be a mother’s parenting behind that. That’s what you don’t have and I have. Finally, one thing! If I had anger on you, it may be gone. But I have hatred and that will never be gone. Huh! "Mahalaxmi bike mechanic shop" Damn, I didn’t expect you to be so. Then holding her from behind saying lizard fell on you was also a lie, right? -Caught hand in darkness, it seems! -Hello! That too without her consent. It isn’t called to be a man. Don’t talk without knowing the facts, sir. It gives me a pain. Then say, what the matter is. What if you don’t win at the cards game? You’d keep playing till you win, sir. And you not caring when she slapped you feels bad not just for me, but even to our cock. We need a joker and not the queen to win in cards game. That queen should pass from our street while returning from tuition. We shall start the real show then. -What do you say? -Yes! -Come on! -Yes, sir! -Oh no, did you listen Bombay? -I heard! -That dirty rascal has planned so badly. -I’m here. Let’s see. Idiot, my plan wasn’t for Chaitra. But it was for you. You put a bait for fish and I put it for you. If you hadn’t come, I’d have done what I thought of and she was out. Your laugh when Chaitra slapped me and your ego when my bike was fined… I didn’t like these two. That’s why I cut them down. Hey! Not just you, I too can use my brains. Move, guys! -Get up, idiot. -Why are you hitting, sir? -Get up, rascal. -What’s wrong, sir? Sir! You think to be a hero? You are after all a bike mechanic. Will you catch a girl’s hand, rascal? Sir! Don’t do anything with the shop, sir. -What? Come again! -Don’t do anything with the shop, sir. It is after my mom’s name, sir. -See what I’d do now with this shed, rascal. -Sir! No! Sir! Sir, please sir! Sir, no please! -Sir! -Your shed should be out by morning. -Come on, guys! -Move! So, you tried to do good and have remained a bad guy like this finally. Still you brought that girl so carefully even after she misunderstood you. You are so great, dude. When the girl who asked me not to show my face ever came to me, I felt my help is very much needed for her, sir. How would love stories come up again for fresh, though there are so many failure stories already? These love stories keep coming up as long as there are girls saying no and boys going behind them, sir. We can’t succeed in love so easily like we can succeed in life, right? Correct, sir! Guy losing never has value in history, but except those losing in love. That’s why we always remember Laila-Majnu, Paru-Devdas and Romeo-Juliet. True, man! But still there’s no winning or losing in love. Loving itself is winning. You should’ve said her truth in this long journey. It is a waste to say to those who cannot listen, sir. “Like your word changing as my word” “I’ve taken them deep into me” “Hesitation is stopping my looks travelling towards you” “I don’t know if I should confess my mistake or not” “Did you listen?” ”Did you listen to the message from the doubt?” “It isn’t crossing the lips and hiding behind, show some courage” “Says no differences and not advancing, steps aren’t moving ahead” “Have you settled into my heart turning into an assurance?” “I’ve been stopping from any shadows coming towards me” “I witnessed your good character and friendship today” “I wish to let go all the shackles and say it with you” “Did you listen?” ”Did you listen to the message from the doubt?” My mom likes these bangles very much. “Heart is restless and is in a dilemma like never before” “It is confused and disturbed, not taking a step ahead” “Breeze wishes to touch the clouds and never wants to stop” “It travels to the clouds and showers its friendship” “That kite celebrating its travel in the skies” “Will it let go the fact of that thread being its base?” “Did you listen?” ”Did you listen to the message from the doubt?” -Raju, thank you. -Ok! -Fine, I’ll leave. -Bye! -Mr Raju! -Who are you? Chaitra madam, how come you are here? You please come in first. Please come. -Ok brother, I’ll leave. -Ok dear! Please say, Chaitra madam. Bangles bought for your mother were with me. Oh no, I’d have taken them tomorrow. Why did you come so far for them now? No problem! Fine, what is your mother doing? I didn’t introduce your mother to you. Please come. This is my mother, Mahalaxmi. Mom, I said about Chaitra of one million package right? It is her. Ok mom, I should get water for Chaitra madam right? My mom is saying to get water for you. My mother doesn’t like if guests aren’t respected. Wait, I’ll get water. Please have it. Why are you seeing so? My mom understands everything I say. You know, I and my mom crack jokes and laugh. If you don’t mistake me, I even said about you stepping in the dung. What exactly happened? I’m sorry. Your dad died on the spot as blood clotted heavily in the brain. Your mom reached vegetated state due to a heavy injury on head. She will have life but there’d be no movement. It may take months, years at time to recover or may remain the same for life time. Raju, what happened? Raju, what happened? Hey, Raju! Where are you going? Raju! Raju! Hey Raju! Son, press this if you need anything or to call me and I’ll come. Mom! Mom! Hey get up, Raju. Raju, get up! Raju, get up! Raju! - Raju, get up! -Mom! Mom! Mom! 968! You never said to have studied? You just saw what I did, but never asked what I studied right? How are you smiling out with such a pain in your heart? My mom likes my smile a lot. Thus this smile is for my mom. When happiness we long for doesn’t be for long, how long will the pain we don’t need stay for? What did the Doctors say? They said to believe in God. Where will my mom leave me and go? We should change the situations if we can. Or we should get habituated. I couldn’t write my B Tech final year exams so. Mechanic work I learnt for fun in the shed my father was running is getting medicines for my mom and food for us today. But I have the confidence that my mother will become normal some day for sure. How can we compare people like me reacting like seriously for every minute thing and people like you always smiling even after carrying such a big pain within? You really are a King (Raju). That name suits you aptly. -Shall we go? -Ok! Please come. Why did you actually come to Bangalore, Mr Raju? Spare parts are very cheap there and I often go there to buy them. Why? -I should join in the job after lockdown, right? -So? -You should take me even then. -At your service, Princess!
