"Hotel California" Lead Vocals: Don Henley On a dark desert highway Cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas Rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance I saw shimmering light My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven or this could be Hell Then she lit up a candle And she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say (welcome to the Hotel California) Such a lovely place (such a lovely place) Such a lovely face (there's plenty of room at the Hotel California) Any time of year (any time of year) You can find it here Her mind is Tiffany-twisted She got the Mercedes Benz She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys That she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard Sweet summer sweat Some dance to remember Some dance to forget So I called up the Captain Please bring me my wine He said 'We haven't had that spirit here" "Since 1969" And still those voices are calling from far away Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say (welcome to the Hotel California) Such a lovely place (such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They're livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling The pink champagne on ice And she said 'We are all just prisoners here" "Of our own device" And in the master's chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before "Relax, " said the night man "We are programmed to receive" "And you can check-out any time you like" "But you can never leave!" Thank you. And good evening. We're the eagles from Los Angeles. Hey I tell you what, if you got firecrackers, save 'em til you get home, lock yourself in the closet and light everything you got ok? Thank you, Joe. One Two Three Four "New Kid In Town" Lead Vocals: Glenn Frey There's talk on the street it sounds so familiar Great expectations everybody's watching you People you meet they all seem to know you Even your old friends treat you like you're something new Johnny come lately The new kid in town Everybody loves you So don't let them down You look in her eyes the music begins to play Hopeless romantics here we go again But after awhile you're lookin' the other way It's those restless hearts that never mend Johnny come lately The new kid in town Will she still love you?

There's so many things you should have told her But night after night you're willing to hold her just hold her Tears on your shoulder There's talk on the street it's there to remind you That it doesn't really matter which side you're on You're walking away and they're talking behind you They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along Where you been lately?

And when you're looking for your freedom (nobody seems to care) And you can't find the door (can't find it anywhere) When there's nothing to believe in (ahhhhhhaaahh) Still you're coming back You're running back You're coming back for more... So put me on a highway And show me a sign And take it to the limit One more time (take it to the limit) (take it to the limit) (take it to the limit) One more time (take it to the limit) Weeeeeeeeee...

One Two Three Four "Lyin' Eyes" Lead Vocals: Glenn Frey City girls just seem to find out early How to open doors with just a smile A rich old man and she won't have to worry She'll dress up all in lace and go in style Late at night a big old house gets lonely I guess every form of refuge has its price And it breaks her heart to think her love is only Given to a man with hands as cold as ice So she tells him she must go out for the evening To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin' She is headed for the cheatin' side of town You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes On the other side of town a boy is waiting With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal She drives on through the night anticipating 'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel She rushes to his arms, they fall together She whispers that it's only for awhile She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever She pulls away and leaves him with a smile You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes She gets up and pours herself a strong one And stares out at the stars up in the sky Another night, it's gonna be a long one She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry She wonders how it ever got this crazy She thinks about a boy she knew in school Did she get tired or did she just get lazy? She's so far gone she feels just like a fool My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things You're still the same old girl you used to be You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes "Rocky Mountain Way" Lead Vocals: Joe Walsh Spent the last year Watchin' the D.C. way Couldn't get much higher Out to pasture I think it's safe to say Time to open fire And we don't need the ladies Cryin' 'cause the story's sad 'Cause the Rocky Mountain way Is better than the way we had Whoa-oh-oh Well he's tellin' us this Tells us that Changes it ev'ry day Says it doesn't matter Bases are loaded And Carter's at bat Playin' it play-by-play Time to change the batter Yeah And we don't need the ladies Cryin' 'cause the story's sad 'Cause the Rocky Mountain way Is better than the way we had Welloooooooh Alright, D.C.
