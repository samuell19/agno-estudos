We know that Rashid you can buy them. Gentlemen, it's obvious. which we have to keep secret. If the information spreads, can have disastrous consequences. Steve, what steps did the FBI take? We turned the country inside out. to try to find the bomb, if it exists. - Suggestions? - We could put it against the wall. "That's not a good idea, Philip. We could free our men and to transfer them to Afghanistan. Nothing guarantees that the Rashid would cease to make demands. If the bomb is here in the USA, he can demand what he wants. What drives us Our military option. We know where it is located the Rashid complex in Afghanistan. Very well. But the dog does not fall, if it is not in the complex. - But you are, Mr. President. "How can we be sure?" He uses a satellite phone. We get the calls you make and we locate it with accuracy. Although what it says is codified, we identify it through the voice. He is there and now. - What if we kidnapped him? "And the guard of honor and the Talibs?" It would be a suicidal mission. - What means do you have in the area? - The USS Nimitz, in the Gulf of Oman, and the Eisenhower parked off Kuwait. We can use F15 to bomb the vents of the complex. This is our best option, Mr President? Senator, this man threatened to kill million Americans. Your 100-year plan aims at making the planet in an Islamic empire. Without Rashid's leadership, his followers would be disoriented and begin to make mistakes, the kind of mistakes that can lead us pump, before it starts. Can we move forward, Mr. President?

You have to work harder. Yes, Mr. President. Since the sentencing in absentia of Rashid I draw up a list of judges qualified for the trial. - Who's on the short list? "The Kaminsky, from Indiana, the Dolan of California, Taylor, Texas ... I know Taylor. He specialized in Middle East. He wrote a book about the Islamic fundamentalist revolution. You know the subject well. It's perfect. - So we went for Taylor? - Is he available? To the Lord? Without doubt. - Great job, Jack.

The teachings of Al they speak of peace, not of violence. The Alcor dizo says: "I do not serve or that you worship and you do not serve what I worship. "You have your religion and I have mine. " This is called religious tolerance, Mr. Rashid. Let's move on. I brought a nuclear device to the USA? Yes, I did.

I have to go for baseball training. - It's okay. Okay. - Okay. Never lower your guard! Are you sure that there is nothing of provocateur in Rashid's speech? We analyzed its transcription several times, Mr. President. We conclude that there is no nothing provocative. In addition, it will be transmitted in deferred terms. Many of you know my face, but few have heard my voice. Do not make hasty judgments about who I am and what I believe.

The Chicago Museum was robbed. Buddhist statues were destroyed, and Police thinks they were supporters of the Taliban. AND? I do not understand. They destroyed two. Had they been the Talibs, they would have destroyed them all. You think that's how they got plutonium into the country. That's why you're going there, to confirm if I'm right. - Come on, Deke. "That's why you're going there, to confirm if I'm right! " Gentlemen, how can I help you? Dr. Everett, can you describe us your contact in Afghanistan? He looked like a businessman Saudi Arabia.

Perfect... ... would be sitting in a tent I was in Afghanistan with my father. to see the news of the explosion on CNN. - What? You heard what he said. - I heard. We all hear. The whole world listened. - He told us to carry the eternal fire to your heart. - It will be written that Ali Faisal was responsible for the death by Fadal Rashid? No. It will be written that I the word of Al . We are not talking about Al , but of my father. And our leader. In this mission, your leader is me. I have to save him, to redeem it from the hands of infidels. You can only later detonate the pump. Save it? When this has become an option? Now, today. And it is not an option; an order. Hazan! Stay by the pump. - Hi, boys. - There are new data? I accessed Chicago telemetry captured by satitel Ford from the robbery to the museum. I followed a vehicle to an electronics store, from where he left 48 hours later, heading south. Chicago should be the target until the Rashid statement changed everything. I asked the FBI to go to the store and they detected vestiges of plutonium. - The van must be in Dallas. - With the bomb. Rashid told us to activate the bomb. I demand that you let me activate it immediately. I obey the orders of Abir, no you I discovered the fate of the vehicle. an open field out of Dallas. He stands in a kind of barn. Satellite images show that nothing was taken from the van. The pump must be inside it. Ask the FBI to investigate. Transmit the information. Right. Thanks. The van is empty. There are no signs of the pump nor of Abir. swear that the nuclear device I was in the van. He escaped us something. Rewind the tape to the van have entered the immediate vicinity of Dallas. Walk forward. What causes the jumps in the image? There are occasional interruptions in telemetry. The satellite has to recalibrate the optical sensors regularly. P ra. Get back to where the van passes under the viaduct. Normal speed. P ra! "You've been under the viaduct for a long time." - You 're right. Must have stopped. Let's see the traffic which circulated in the opposite direction, when the van passed under the overpass. P ra! The tank truck stopped at the same time as the van. They switched the pump to the truck. while they were under the viaduct. Raises the image of the truck. Talford ... Qadi. Let's see what data we get. Here you are! I discovered the profile of the director of the Talford-Qadi refinery. Reza Qadi, a naturalized American, born in Saudi Arabia. He made a fortune in Venue Oil, before opening your business. Financing the Taliban during the war between the Afghans and Russians. Where's the refinery? Just 5 miles south of Dallas. - I'll get the plants. "Let's get ready, Deke. Faisal. At 6:00 the FBI will take my father. to the court. Program the pump for noon. I'll meet you at the aerdrome. ACTLVADA There you are. I have to work out the plans. Stay by the pump. - Here's the plan. - I'll get the van. The refinery can cause interference in communications. I know. Speaking of communications, you do not should you encourage Deke? You've been hard on him lately. I acted as needed. I wish he was more like you And this is it. Thank you dear. But he has a personality of his own. If you allow me an observation, a very special type. Just give me a second. If you hit the bomb before Joshua, Remember the orders. Disables the main terminal B, the secondary C and D and then the matrices A and B. I noticed. Do yourself a favor. Shoot as little as possible. - A lost bullet and the refinery ... - I noticed, that. I think you already know everything. Sometimes, I'm too perfectionist. Listen, what. To a professional and so do I. From professional to professional, How about if you give me a kiss? to be lucky? - On here. V l . - I give up! I kiss well. Aria! 1:00. The only people agreed we should be and the terrorists. Did you know what it's two years ago? What did you recruit me for? No, I did not know. I will never forget our first mission. I remember thinking: "Whoever does this is short-lived." "And now, what do you think?" - Good... I admit that the training you gave me it was an incredible experience. You made me do things. which he thought was humanly impossible. Human limitations s exist in our mind. Think about it. Before the Wright brothers, nobody imagined that we would fly And much less that we would reach the moon. That's what you did for me. You made me believe that everything is possible. Now I believe that my life has meaning. I'm a President's man. Thank you. You deserved it. Are we looking for the bomb? It neutralizes the guards. I'm going to look for the bomb. Deke, there's a sentinel. on the north side. There is a man on your floor. to go in your direction, Deke. Joshua, you have a man. To your left, very close to you.
