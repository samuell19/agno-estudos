Subtitles by explosiveskull Hey,. Javier. Senior Levin, the contract for the new property has been changed. I just need you to confirm it. The price of the warehouse is now approximately three million dollars. You can get rid of the old workers whenever you like. You just have to sign the contract. Wouldn't you rather drive in the armored limo? No. Kidnapping has increased lately. I don't wanna drive such a big car to Managua. You better take good care of my wife. If something happens to her I'm holding you fully responsible. One day all this is gonna belong to her. Valentina, I beg you, please don't make a mistake. I'm gonna be gone for 14 days and it would be a shame if when I come back I have to break your little nose. Do you understand me, Valentina? Do you understand? Kiss me. Be a good girl. Sir. Remember, you must take care of Valentina. Leonora, Leonora! Thanks. Mr. Guerra. Yes? I'm Rodrigo Alvarez, I wanna get straight to the point. Are you still in business? So who cares if I'm still in the business? How can I help you? I don't wanna waste time. The word is you're a specialist when it comes to kidnapping cases and you're one of the best in the industry. Really? Well does the word say as well that my partner and I are out of the business and haven't accepted a job in the last two years? It's gonna stay that way, so I can't help you. Perhaps you wanna listen to what I have to say. I'm sure I can get your attention. Ryan, can you come here for a minute? All right, I'm listening. Now you know the kidnapper, it's Javier Moralas. Now you might understand why I flew all the way out here just to meet you. Javier Moralas, I thought he was sitting behind bars? Not anymore. His rebels freed him several weeks ago, and right afterwards they kidnapped my bosses wife and left the place a massacre. Morales? Doesn't strike me as a kidnapper. Anyway, that's what he did. Mr. Guerra, how about the following proposition. You fly out to meet my boss and talk to him. In this envelop is $2,500. For you. If you come out to meet my boss, there will be another 2,500 just to listen to him. If you don't like what you hear you walk away and you can keep the whole 5,000, how's that huh? Five grand, just to fly out and listen to your boss? All right. How can I reach you the next few hours? I'm at Marina Beach Hotel. I fly back in the afternoon. All right, I'm gonna contact you with the details. We'll see you later. Have a nice day. Take us out. Are you sure he's the right guy? There's no better. David Guerra used to work as a military consultant for Ortega for many years before he went back to the states. It was him who tracked down Javier Moralas five years ago. In the last two years he's rumored to have freed more than 100 hostages. If anybody can bring back you're wife, it's him. Mr. Guerra. I'm Anthony Levin, this is my assistant Franzisco Alvarez. I hope you had a good trip, Mr. Guerra. Well, apart from being held in Managua Airport for seven hours, it was just fine. Sorry to hear that. Don't worry, I'm used to it here. We live under a terrorist dictatorship. Thank you very much for coming. Have a seat. Can we offer you anything? I'd rather just get down to business. Well, of course. That's a beautiful woman. Yes, she is. She's my wife. How well do you know him? Well enough, I would say. And what, what is your opinion of him? Let's put it this way, I have the upmost respect for him as a soldier. I understand. This soldier you respect so much, this soldier has kidnapped my wife 17 days ago. So far, we haven't heard from him and nor from her. Mr. Guerra, you are my last hope. I beg you, please, bring back my wife. Without her, my life is meaningless. I love her so much. Mr. Levin, I'm going to explain very pragmatically how I see the situation and what I can do for you. You see in this country there are countless criminals and political groups that live off kidnapping. Some of them do it to get rich, others to fund the rebel movement. - Let's see him. - But no matter which group we talk about it is always about the money, and nothing else. Rarely are the motives different. That's why I can only advise you to wait until the kidnappers contact you. Who can be sure that these psychopaths are not gonna kill her in the meantime? Nobody, but you don't have another choice. Your plan is too risky. Your wife is being held somewhere up in the mountains. Not even government forces dare go near that area, and to find Javier up there is almost impossible. He's very clever and he constantly moves his camp. If he realizes we're after him, it would mean your wife's immediate death. So, I'm supposed to wait? For how long? Difficult to say. It may be a week or even a month before the kidnappers contact you, and then suddenly out of no where, when you don't see it coming, they're gonna make their demands. This approach is designed to wear you out, and the longer this game goes on, the higher the demands. And Javier is not gonna go about it any other way. He has no interest in killing your wife. He wants money, and lots of it. Mr. Levin, guess how many men Javier has with experience of battle? 100? 200, or even more? What would you guess? That question is irrelevant. I'm sorry, Mr. Levin, I cannot assist you in this matter. One million. I'm gonna pay you one million dollars if you bring back my wife, and I'm gonna add another million if you deliver also Javier Moralas, dead or alive, I don't care. Mr. Guerra, I know we're going against all the odds, but if anyone can accomplish this, it is you. As long as there is a chance, one chance, I'll keep fighting for my wife's life. That is to your credit, Mr. Levin, but it is impossible. Let's say that I do the job and hypothetically we're lucky enough to find his hideout. How are we supposed to free your wife and at the same time capture Javier Moralas and make it the whole way through unsafe territory to bring him back here? It is impossible. Are you recognizing a pattern here? I'm repeating myself and I rarely do that. On the other hand, your offer is quite compelling. That's a lot of money. Mr. Levin, let's leave it at that. I will talk it over with my partner and then I'll get back to you. Give me a couple of days. All right. That's it, that's it, go. Yeah, left, left, left, yeah. Keep guarding, keep guarding. Go, okay, yeah, come on. Down low, come on, come on, come on, come on. Get in there. Yeah, come on. Keep it going. And? Well, interesting job. Oh yeah, attacking Javier Moralas, that's going to war against him. Aren't you a little bit too old for that? Do you really think so? Ryan, I get it, but have you checked our bank balance lately? If we don't make some cash real soon, we're in serious trouble. Hey, of course we have to think about the risk. Now we'll talk to Ernesto. With him on our side, we got a real chance of making it work. If not, then we won't even think about it. But if I manage to convince him, then we should give it a try. 'Cause if anyone knows where Javier is, it's him. I agree, without him we wouldn't stand a chance. I'll meet him at the border, then we'll see. All right? It's gonna be fine. Relax, huh? All right, gonna see you. All right, come on, come on, that's it. Yeah, come on. Yeah. Don't you recognize her? No. Cheyenne? You got it. My God, wow. The last time I saw you, you were like a teenager. Probably 14 or 15. - 15. - Yeah. Yeah, she's become a beautiful woman and I'm really proud of my daughter. That's right, you should be proud. Let's have a chat. The two of you should go on. I'll look after the horses. - Okay. - Okay, come on. Let's get down to business. Sure. You're gonna find a lot of bandits around this area here. All right. It would be better to avoid them if we can. We shouldn't underestimate them. They're pretty dangerous. All right. This here is Javier's camp. And this here is yours. Nowadays, there are four different rebel groups in the area. And they're all fighting against each other. Are you sure your informant's reliable? I wouldn't be here if not. Okay, Cheyenne will lead you to him. Cheyenne? Yeah, she knows this area like the back of her hand, and she's a better shot than any of my other guys. She can hit anyone at a range of a mile. A mile? Javier and kidnapping by the way, the two don't go together. I know he's an asshole, but I never thought he'd be involved in kidnapping. Times are changing. People also. Especially when you spend so much time in prison. Yes. The meeting with Ernesto went all fine. It seems that Ernesto has a score to settle with Javier. In any case, he didn't want any money. With him and his rebels we have a real shot at winning this thing. So, any good news your end? No, no good news. Manuel is dead. Jason, he's in Chile doing life in some top security prison on a murder charge. - Oscar died. - Oscar died? Died in Lima in a road accident. He ran his car off a cliff 500 meters up, they never found the body. But even if he survived, I wouldn't know where to look for him. Daniel Francis is in North Korea. He's looking after their space station north of Pyongyang or something. Jesus Christ, Ryan. Is there anyone left? What about Dennis and Alexander? Dennis lives in Costa Rica, he has a night club and he's still hooked on coke, and Alexander went back to Russia. He now lives the countryside. All right, but these are the guys we need. I know that Alexander and I didn't end in a good way, but I think if only... Wait, wait, I'm okay that you wanna meet Dennis, I'm okay with that, but you wanna take the trouble of going all the way to Russia just to straighten things out with Alexander? Yes. It's worth it. I want Alexander on the team. Hello, is this the farm of Alexander Glove? What if? Sergeant Alexander Golev, do you know where I can find him? Alexander. Let me tell you why I'm here. Wait, listen to me. I am listening. I've got a job, I want you to join me, okay? 100,000 for each of us, 100,000. Did you forget about last time? Last time was different, okay? It was a setup. This time there's gonna be no bloodshed. Okay? Just calm down. How many people do I have to kill? It's a normal hostage situation. The usual, just a businessman who wants his wife back. No politicians, no children, no drug lords, he just wants his wife back. Where? Nicaragua. No way, I can't leave my wife alone here. I'm just gonna need you for a week, okay? Before your child's born, you'll be back. You'll never have to pick up a gun again, ever. Time for you to go. Alexander. I'm serious. Half in advance, the rest after the job. You know where to find me. Think about it. Nothing to think about. Wait a minute, David, is that you? Hey, Dennis. To what do I owe the pleasure? Well, I see you haven't changed a bit. Why should I change? It's my lifestyle man, you know what I'm saying? Girls, hey, come on, give me that. If you want some, this is the best blow in town, promise you. I would prefer to get right to the point. I didn't fly 6,000 miles just to do some coke with you and fuck one of your whores. What do you want? I have a job. I need to do some shopping. Shopping? Let me see. Hey, baby. - Stop it. - One second. Get the fuck off of me. Let me go. - Take this. - Get off of me. - Thanks. - Don't touch me. - Oh, yeah hey, my turn baby. - Asshole. Get him out. So, where were we? Some shopping. Can you deliver? Yeah, but for who? It's going to Nicaragua. Okay, I can get it all and I don't want any money, it's free. And you know why? Fucking Javier Moralas, I hate him. More than five years before he took a five million dollars from me. I never got it back. Believe me, I would do anything to kill him. Do you need some rockets too? No, the weapons on the list will be enough. So, do we have a deal? Yeah, but I've gotta say, it's dangerous. He's so strong. He has a big army in Nicaragua, David. Don't trust anyone. Okay, if you want, I'll join you. But you know what, not for the money, just to fuck him, and for you, okay? Well, if you want me I'll be there. You know that. Don't just sit there, shit. Come on, let's get the party going. Come on, yes. My best friend's here in party time, , that's it. Come on. Come on. Five more. Punch, come on, punch. Go, go, go, go, go. It doesn't look, Ryan. Dennis seems to have lost it completely and Alexander has two kids and a wife, and a third on the way, so I doubt if he's gonna join us. You know what I think, David? This mission is far too dangerous. It would work better if we hired a few mercenaries. Nicaragua is full of Russians and Ukrainians on crack ready to go to war for what? A few fucking dollars. Ryan, forget about it. I know the plan will work. We don't need to hire that scum. At the first sign of trouble they're gonna turn on us, and worse, end up doing Javier's dirty work. We need reliable men. That's the most important thing. We go undetected into Javier's camp, and that's only possible with a handful of men we can rely on. - All right? - All right. We can trust Ernesto 100%, besides, he's the only one I know that knows the way to Javier's camp. All right. It's just frustrating that all the good men that we know are either dead or in jail or hard to get ahold of. Look at Shannon. What happened to Shannon? I tried to get in touch with his old buddy, Paco. But that freak doesn't wanna say anything. I got no where on the phone. We need to see him in person. Come on. All right. Let's pay him a visit then. Tell you what though, got some good news. What? I know about Hurricane's next fight. All right, sounds good. We'll leave tomorrow, all right? Yeah. Come on, little princess. That's all you got? You better shut your mouth. What's up, princess, don't be shy. Hurricane, I have a job for you. Some big money on play, you won't have to see this shit hole again. Give me one second and I'll be back. Yeah! David. Hello? We're looking for Paco. There is no Paco here. Well that's strange, 'cause this is his garage. Paco,. We just need a little bit of information. Oh, you need information? I have information. Shit! Paco, Paco, Paco. What is wrong with you? Fuck you, pal. Okay, tough guy. I just got one question. 'Cause I'm a nice guy, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. Where's Shannon? I don't know. Really? All right, all right, okay. He's in Managua. He's with some bitch in the mountains. I don't know anything else. Okay. So, wasn't so hard. Thanks for the info. Ah, do you want me to give him a message from you? Yeah, fuck you man. Okay, I guess that means no. Hi. Is this the house of Shannon O'Connor? I mean, do you know where we could find him? And who wants to know. Well, we're old friends of his. I'm David and this is Ryan. I never heard of you. And what do you want from him? We just wanna ask him something. Oh you want to ask him something, hm. That's good. That's really good. So, is he here or not? Certainly he is. He's in the house. Just come in and say hi. Have you got an HK for me? Yep, all the guns you wanted. I like that gun. Me too, better than an AK. Okay, I think we've got enough arms. Give it a little tap, that's it. That'll do it. Ah, and here comes the money. One, two, three, four, and five. We're six. You forgot Cheyenne outside. Oh, six. No, we're seven. Oh there you go, seven. Mr. Guerra, as soon as I get my wife back I'm selling the hacienda. I'm returning to Mexico and I will never come back to Nicaragua. But you don't get it, I can't leave without her. Mr. Levin, if you're not confident enough to trust us with this mission, you can pay me and the others a reasonable amount and we'll immediately stop everything. I didn't mean that, but you've gotta understand I'm a little nervous and I don't know how you're gonna do it. With six men and a woman, against a whole army? Mr. Levin, I already explained to you that you don't need to worry about our strategy. You just gotta trust me that I know exactly what I'm doing. If everything goes according to plan, I will bring back your wife and Javier. So now, you choose. Pay us now or cancel the mission. There it is, one million dollars. You don't have to count it. Rosario, this is for you. Count the money and best not spend it right away, okay? I'll try not to. Let's go, guys. - Come on boys, pack it up. - Let's go. So, Mr. Levin, so there's no shred of a doubt, we will do everything we can to bring back your wife. So let's not waste anymore time, you gotta trust me. Let's move. Ayah! Ya, ya. Giddy up. Ya, ya. - David, I need the money. - David, let's have it. Here's the situation: we've got food and water for three days. Once we get out the valley things should be easier right now. Then see to it. What you seeing? They're not farmers, they're bandits. Hm. You see? They have guns under their jackets. They've been following us for a few hours now. Yup, we should get rid of 'em now. I got an idea. Come on, guys. We should go, come out here. All right, listen up. We have a situation, okay? We got people on our tail and we need to take care of some shit, okay? Okay. Cheyenne and I are gonna be the bait. I want you guys to spread out, okay? Everybody tight, move. Move. - Go. - Let's move. I smell some money, amigos. They are pretty close. Ayah! Let's go. Come on, let's go. Ya, ya. Ya, ya, ya. Hello my black friend. Good morning pretty miss. Can I help you with anything? No, thank you. We just having a little break. My wife is ill. We will continue riding in a moment. Oh, you're American. Are you lost? Are you tourists? Yes, we are. On our honeymoon. So, your honeymoon. But this isn't really the place for a honeymoon. Hasn't anybody told you that it's very dangerous here? For real? Really. They say there's bandits around these parts, you know? Nasty little hombres. Who like to attack tourists in order to rob them and rape their women. Especially Americans, get attacked real often. Where are the others? What others? It looks like this American is trying to play us for fools then. That's not very nice. Trouble is, gringo, I only see one horse. But there are tracks for seven horses. So, I'll ask you once again. Where are your friends and what are you doing here? And also I want to see what your pretty lady has got in her bag. They why don't you come down and have a look. Okay, but first I'm gonna put a bullet in your fucking brain. Go, go, go, come on. Get rid of all this trash and move those horses out. Quickly, let's get out of here. If they find the horses then we're blown. Forget about it, they won't find 'em. Okay my friends, this is Isabelle, let's ask her what she thinks. Come on, Isabelle. Okay. I think the best time to attack is during the night, when everyone's asleep. That way we have the element of surprise. No, that's impossible. At night time they double the guards. You wanna attack during the day? That is suicide. What is wrong with your informant, Ernesto? Quiet, David, let her talk. Wait, what do you think, Isabelle? Look David, Ortega already made the mistake of attacking the fort during the night. It was a mess. The government troops took heavy losses. Javier has the best soldiers in the world. A lot of Ukrainian and Russian fighters. There are hidden paths and secret tunnels through here. Several of the houses are also connected by underground passageways. You have no chance at night. So an attack can only work this way. During the day they're distracted. They'll be training here. One group attacks the trainees, that's not a problem. I will lead the others to Javier and I take care of the guards. - You? - Yeah. Why are you laughing? Please, okay, really, I'm sorry. How are you gonna take care of the guard? I'll take his place and give you a sign when everything is clear. Is there any chance that we can check out how we're gonna get in and out of the fort right now? Okay, I will show you. Let's go. You guys stay here, we'll check it out. How's the little one, okay? Alex, we'll be back in two hours, okay? Sure thing. Hello, are you still there? How many men in the fort? 38, you have to be careful. Javier can mobilize more than 500 men within a day. The others are scattered in the mountains. It doesn't matter. Javier doesn't think anyone's gonna have the balls to attack him. Not even government troops. Forget it, we should start tomorrow at sunrise. You think that's gonna work, Isabelle? Yes, tomorrow morning should be good. At that time Valentina usually goes to Leonora's grave and Javier trains with his men. All right, then we'll do it as planned. While you get Valentina, I'll keep Javier and his men busy. All right, but do you think that we can trust her? Or is she gonna lead us into a trap? Nothing is certain, only death. Come on, let's go. Go, go, go. Hi, Valentina, how are you? Let's move. Stop. Go, go, go, go. Push through. Fire in the hole! Come on. Move. Alex, get up. Look at me, get up. Come on, move. You can do it. It's not far, come on. Keep moving. Ryan, Ryan, where are you? Ryan, do you copy? We're on the way back. All right. We couldn't follow, all right? We had to take another route. We'll take the boat. We'll meet at the camp. All right, we'll meet you there, but don't move. Okay, watch your backs. Good luck, over and out. Come on, let's go. Alex, all right, keep fighting. Let's keep fighting. Come on. Come on, man, let's go. Are you trying to kill him. Listen, pull of his shirt and soak it in the water. What is it to you if he lives or dies? Now understand, if he lives we have to slow down, and that gives Javier a chance to catch up. Right? Come on. Come on. Do not try to run. And? They're coming. We have less than 10 minutes. What do you think? Will we take him or no? What do you suggest? We need to change direction. Along the lake and they try to reach the camp. We could reach it in three hours. Inside the camp we'll have time to think about what to do next. It's our only chance, unless we leave him behind. I would never leave him behind. Let's go to the camp. Look, he's not gonna make it. He's gonna die. Why are you staring at me like that. I'm just thinking. Why has Javier kidnapped you? And why is anyone willing to pay two million dollars for you? Now I understand what's going on. Anthony hired you, right? Please, you don't understand. I haven't been kidnapped. Javier and I were in love long before I married Anthony Levin. You have been tricked. I don't have time for this. Cheyenne, we move out. Alex, get up. Help me. Move, come on. Come on, buddy, you can do it. Damn it. Hurricane, get him inside, come on. Grab her, grab her. Don't you fight. How is he? Not good. He's going to die. You know, I ask myself this question all the time. What kind of people do anything for money? Why did you for such a long time work for a corrupt regime that mercilessly exploits our country? Why do you and your friends kill people? All just for the money? Is there nothing you won't do? No matter how many people die. Do you think that Javier's any different? How many men has he killed or ordered to be killed? Tell me? The graveyards are full of his victims. I know Javier well. I know how brutal he can be. Javier doesn't kill for money. He had to kill to avoid being killed himself. That's something different. You know nothing about him. Nothing. And you? What about you? Do you think you are any better? If you haven't been kidnapped, then you went along willingly, then you're nothing, nothing but a lousy adulteress. Javier is on his way. Everyone up. How many men? 20 or 30, no more. It's show time. Come on, - let's show em real men. - Come on. Hey come on, we'll give 'em a little surprise. - Come on, let's go. - Let's do this. - Come on. - Come on. David, Javier is coming. Come on, let's go. Watch her. Hurricane! Come on, assholes. Fuck you, come on. I never believed we'd end up at war with Javier. So, what are you gonna do? Go back to the fort? I can't go back, they'll be suspicious now. So you wanna... I told you, we'll meet again. Why didn't you shoot me, after all we've seen together... Cheyenne! Hey. - Valentina. - You're okay. - Javier! - David, hi. Where's Anthony? David. Javier, what has become of you? From freedom fighter to kidnapper. Shit. Drop it. I said drop the gun. On the ground. I don't wanna kill you, but I will if I have to. Okay, David, are you man enough? Come on. Come on. Fight me. Fight with me! Come on, get up. Don't. David! This isn't over yet. Don't move. Don't you move! I'm sorry, Cheyenne. I never thought it would be this way. Leave me alone. David, come on. All right, watch them. We have no time to lose. You have to try to reach the border as fast as possible. Because all hell is going to break loose here very soon. Will you manage without me. I think so. I guess so. Was it really worth it? All this, for this woman? What we did was a big mistake. It's too late to think about it now. It's a fact. Thanks for everything, Cheyenne. I will burn these memories all together. When I bury my father. I will come back, I promise. What was that for? In case we never see each other again. Right, let's move out. Come on. Ya. Ya, ya. Here you go. Thanks again, buddy. Over there. Hey, let's go. David, I missed you so much. Down. Take care of the horses, okay? Thank you, you made it back here. Yeah, we did. With a lot less men unfortunately. You've make a big mistake. Do you really think that I am a kidnapper? It's all there. Thank you. I am sorry for your losses. My wife and I are very grateful. Valentina, come to me. Don't touch her you dirty piece of shit. Don't touch her. - Come here. - Don't touch her. Alvarez, shoot him. Don't do it. - Thank twice about this. - Okay, okay. I said, shoot him. Stop. Everything's cool. Fuck you, you do it. Go. I never agreed to this. You have no right to kill him. Anthony, they know everything. They know that I belong to him. You belong to me. You're my wife. Levin, you heard her. She doesn't want to stay with you. She hates you. Get this piece of shit outa here. Easy now, guys. That's a bad idea. Maybe, but I know what I'm doing. I wouldn't do that. It's okay, Ryan. Rosario, bring the horses. Get up. You better say nothing now, before I change my mind. Just get out of here. Ya! Look after the money. If we don't come back, you'll be rich, ya. Please come back. I'll miss you.
