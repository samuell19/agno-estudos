This day wasn't particularly a good one for him. He was 10 minutes late for the train, and as a result, he had to take the next one that left an hour later. The schedule that he had meticulously planned for the day fell to the wayside, but it didn't matter to him. He knew that if he had to live his life by times and rhythms, that he could never achieve what it was that he wanted. At least, not in any satisfactory way that he could wake up the next day and felt that he had achieved enough to move on. He nevertheless had achieved what he had wanted that day, and felt that he could take a breath and sit. Tomorrow was another day, and the dread of and responsibilities of tomorrow would keep him up this night. This day was very different for him. He vowed every night that he would change his ways. He told himself this every night, and truly believed that he could change. Yes, he wanted to change, he wanted to be different. - You like that, don't you? Love those old-fashioned tape machines. We don't sell much of those anymore. I gotta be honest with you, you know, it's all landfill now, those old tape machines. - My baby. - The other advantage is jerkin' off to porn, you know the digital stuff runs a little fast. I've still got my old VHS stash to jerk off to. You interested? - Yeah, yeah, I'll take it. - Cool, 150 bucks. But the impulse was too strong that it overtook him. Once he had crossed that line, there was no going back. He had done this before, but day 11 was different. Day 11 was significant because he had felt something for her, something genuine. He remembered how he first met her. This was the decision that would change his life forever. That's an old one, isn't it? - Yeah. That's tape, right? You know, like Betamax or VHS? - Yeah. - My dad has stacks and decks sitting in his closet. Hasn't used it in many years. He has a lotta cool stuff. I used to see his tapes scattered on the floor. - You still close to your dad? - Yeah. Yeah, he's saved me a lotta times. No! No! - Saved? - You know. How old are you? - 17. Well, I don't mean he saved me like Jesus. I just mean that when I fell down during times, you know, like difficult times in the past? - But you're only 17. - And? Well. My father's been the only one I can look up to. He has saved me, he has rescued me. I have no faith in anyone else. My friends are all backstabbers. - So you don't have real friends? - Real? No. - Nobody you can count on then? - I give too much, and they let me down. - How does that make you feel? - How would you feel if your bestie fucked your BF and didn't give a shit about you? - Yeah. - Yeah. Now, a friend is someone you can just confess things to. Like, I can say I want to kill my mom, or fuck my brother, and that's that. It's like I can't say anything to anyone anymore, and I don't even have any feelings. My friends reject me because I don't go to church. Sometimes I wish I could just fly away. Brandon knew he had found her. - I beg you. Why are you doing this? No, don't do that. Please. Stop! - Your dad, he isn't doing too well. - You spoke to him? - He called from Memphis. I guess all that drinking and binging finally got to him, the bastard. He needs dialysis. That's the least of it. He asked about you. He hopes you find something to do, something on your own, without me enabling you. He says you're a failure, and you need to accept that. And do something. Hey, you. Hey. So my mom, she's such a fucking bitch, you know? It's just this disconnection. I don't think she understands anything anymore. I'm doing the best I can, you know? - Yeah. I don't have any friends. I just need someone to talk to some time. I don't have anyone. - Yeah, I know. - Yeah, I don't think Mom wants me to finish school at all. I don't think she wants me to stay here. Dressed like as a fucking whore, all her life. I don't know what she sees in those track guys. - Track guys? - You know, the guys that run in their shorts for miles and miles. I don't really know the point of it anyway, to run all those miles and wear off your body like that, yeah, only to say you're the winner. Like, what is winning anyway? I won, well, I sorta won the spelling bee one year. I was second place. They gave me a plaque. I don't even know where it is anymore. Mom wasn't really proud of it. She said the judges cheated and that Chinese girl from Monrovia should have won. She didn't like that I had won. Hmm. Jesse's texting me now, wants to know where I am. Wanna be at that star there. That star is the furthest one away. - Mm-mm. That's the closest one. Furthest one is the big one right there. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Huh. - I mean, why be far away when you can be close by, right?

Dahlia, I wanted to call you. It's been too long. I know I should have reached out sooner but this week has been incredibly insane. You have no idea. I wonder, how's Ophelia doing? I miss her, is she okay? How are her grades? Is she eating okay? I know, I'm asking too many questions. I'm really sorry, my dear. I love you, you know that. I don't know. Do you think that we could attempt to be together again, at least for Ophelia? Maybe we can make it work out. My job's promoting me to a big case now, and things will be better financially. I've amassed quite a bit of savings, so no more excess anymore, my love. I just wonder if we could give this another chance. After all we've been through. Come on, man! Why don't you do a seizure for once? Shut up! - Well, well, well, look what we have here. - Right, nice, that'll buy you a few years, won't it, huh? All the evidence we need. Shut up! Keep gettin' him. Fuck you, cock sucker! Fuck you! Hey, hey! - Yeah, fuck you. Bugger off, wanker! I said shut up! - Who are you calling a wanker? - Detective, here's your papers. Is there anything else you need? - No, that's great, thank you, Samantha. - How's your boyfriend? - Good. This is a new prototype. Even the gangs and the Chinese haven't been able to get ahold of this one yet. Pretty soon, we'll be using these on duty. - Come off it, Tim, really? - Yeah, anything's possible, isn't it? I mean, would you have predicted any of this that's happened, cars that drive themselves, phones that know what you wanna eat next, what music you're gonna listen to? Guess no real reason for any of us to exist, right? I can't even predict this kinda thing. That's great. - It was really catching that pervert last week. - Which one? - The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep. - The wood are lovely, dark and deep. And I have promise to keep. - These woods are lovely, dark and deep. And miles before. - It's over, you're caught. It's over! You know the crank caller, the one jerkin' off over the phone and blind-calling in girls. Oh, yeah, yeah. Where were you on the night of April 13th? - I told you, I was in bed, sleeping. - Right, and somebody can corroborate this? Yes. - You killed John Gaines. We have three key witnesses who saw you rob that liquor store, and kill this guy in cold-blooded murder when it all went wrong. - It wasn't me. - It wasn't you. - It wasn't me. - It wasn't you. You piece of shit. - Poor girl. Coroner thinks it may have only taken her two hours to die. With all the markings on her throat, there were at least a dozen attempts to strangle her. My guess is two hours for it to all go down. - This is a terrible situation. - It is. - Not yet. Not yet. You're quiet today. I'm leaving this town. Next week, in fact. No, I did not find religion, but I'm just turning a new leaf. I'm moving back up to my mom's in Oregon. I'm going to start a jewelry business. Oh, no need to be so heartbroken. There is a very special girl, very special, and she will take my place, you know? It's not like I'm leaving forever. It's just a thousand miles away. I'll come visit you. I have a four p.m. client, I think you should leave now. Dahlia, day 289. Without you, it's not the same. I've begun writing again. Well, not actually writing. I've been keeping a journal, but it's a journal based on my recollections and dates. For example, and I know I have the date wrong, but do you remember the time you slapped me? I have it written down in my journal as occurring on June 16th. You'll need to correct me if I'm wrong about this, but I remember distinctly that the 15th was a Sunday that year, and Monday's paper, I went to fetch that morning, and then you slapped me that evening. It didn't hurt, but I was stunned for sure. I'd never seen you as physical as you were that night.

She seems to know how to play older when she needs to be. - You mentioned she was murdered. But isn't murder part of our DNA now? We've discussed all of this yesterday, we've been over all of this. Anything else you wanna tell me? For one brief moment, no matter how much we fought, no matter how much we hated each other... Yes! Yes! Yes! Pass out, baby. No matter how much we wanted to kill each other. Motherfucker, you! You motherfucker! The one brief moment, that one moment when hate turned to love, it was fleeting, but it was there. - So, I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right? You're not seriously thinking about going back out there and finding that whole lolita crowd again, are you? Because you cannot, Robert, not anymore, it's dangerous. Oh, my God, you are! You're contemplating jeopardizing everything and going back out there, aren't you? You can't, do you understand me? Like, no fucking way can't. - Stephanie, I must do... - You must. You psycho. Yes, yes. Pass out. Yes! What was the first thing you felt? The room became darker, like watching the lights go down as the theater program begins. And do you remember when you blacked out? No, it was like a switch turned off. No, more like a fade. It just dimmed out. What do you remember when you woke? I remember this intense euphoria. You got it, baby. No one ever experiences that the first time. I'm so impressed you got to that level. The mind needs to be there to bring us to full realization. Day 335. Dahlia, I need you. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. I wake up and don't want to wake up unless you're next to me. The coffee I make in the morning isn't even the same. I can't smell you as I shower in the morning. Time just seems to pass by in its own fleeting butterfly-ous way, and I can't catch on to it. I can't grasp it in any way that's meaningful. And I've been making the wrong choices. I can't stand what I've become. Timothy, I know you still get a thrill out of this all, but I'm gonna call it quits soon. - You will, for what? After being nice guys for so many years? We busted our asses all these years, did everything above the board, only so those fucks could get promotions for the cases that we solved. I have no regrets in what we're doing, Robert. - Well, it's just enough for me. If there ever was a thrill, there isn't one anymore. - What are you gonna do, go after your winery then? Assuming they give you a good enough pension if you stick it out long enough. What if I became the good guy for once? Good luck, pal. Can't change a horse's stripes. - They're zebras. - Same difference. The zebra is a horse, or whatever they say. We're in too deep, buddy, and you know it. You have to play this out. You. - Okay, we if that makes you feel any better. Stakes are high, you just gotta roll with it, baby. So I think I found her. Oh? I was at the coffee place ordering my usual black chai, and then I saw her. Same eyes as your girl, same facial structures. It's crazy, the resemblance, uncanny. Her face was like porcelain, like those antique porcelain dolls. Her eyes dark, deep blue, just like your girl's. So what did you do. I was literally frozen, I couldn't move. I wanted to walk up to her, but I just couldn't believe the resemblance. We spoke. She admitted she made some wrong choices early on, and was just looking to get back on track with her life. She's broke, as you might have guessed. That's where you come in, if you wanna do this. Okay. - I saw you. And, well, you were alone, so. I was alone too, and well, I was hoping to talk to you because I was alone too. I just said that, didn't I? - Yes, you did. - Yeah. - You could really benefit from my sessions. Here. Call me. Are you hesitating? She said she's done this type of thing before. You're sure? Baby, look me in the eye. Tell me you don't trust me after all that we've been through. I don't think you're going to believe what you see, baby. It's almost like she came to us from another world or something because they knew we wanted her, like some cosmic gift. Oh, we sound like sci-fi nuts now. Well, at least I do. Anyway. I don't know what I'm doing anymore, Stephanie. Robert, it's too late for this now. From the moment you stepped into my office, I knew that we'd get to this level, baby. We said every step of the way, no matter how hard or how fucked up it was going to be, we said we could and would just move on. Am I right? Do you remember this at all? Or do you only remember the fucking? There's no regrets, understand? Do you understand me, baby? Baby, are you there? Yes. If you like her, then she must come to Stanton's teachings next week. Oh, give her 500 bucks, please. She needs rent money. Where's she staying? Do you really wanna know? I guess not. - A lot of what you experience in life is completely related and directly inherent to these preconceived notions that we have about our lives. how to live it. How much of it do you live? How much are you willing to live and not hold back and accept the energy of all of these incoming forces? Therefore, we like to stress that this will be a highly individual and personal experience for you, 'cause it takes time, it takes years of living life, perhaps, to be in full balance, to experience the ultimate, the right mindset, the right body, touch your nerves. Touch them. We're all circuit. Feel it! Feel yourselves. Feel the physical. Feel the emotional. But what is emotion? Because what we think, it's psychological, isn't it? And this psychological force, this energy, these cosmic lines combine and are created by a physical entity, a brain, a goddamn brain! - We are late. - I'm sorry. - We are already conscious above what they already know. And we strive to go to places with our physical bodies where are physical bodies cannot go, unless we are one, one with the universe. Love is the answer. Love is one continuous endless dream. Everyone needs love. Movement number one, raise your hands. Raise them. Higher. Higher. Higher still. Higher. Higher. Reach for the sky. Movement number two. - I don't think I can do this. - The mind blocks us, but there will always be a metaphysical path. The mind knows. Our perceptions of reality are based upon what we see and what we read. But what about feelings? Feelings is truthful and do not let them dictate to you what you feel. Four! Feelings are your own experience, and you take with it whatever is inside of you. 4.5! All these molecules that are trying to insert themselves into you and bang you all to hell... - I know I know can do it. - Five! - Please! - I ask you, you have the right afterwards to morph with that. Six! I can! - Reject that cosmic sperm if you choose, and be whatever it is you want to be. The moment she picked up the vial, she knew.

And screw those mothers. But my school changed their lunch menu for all the popular people, like James Steven and Linda Kendall. - They changed the lunch menu 'cause of popular kids? - Yeah, you can change a lunch menu. Well, for the elite few, you know, the real ones in the know, we were able to special order in the morning. You know, like tell the teacher in the morning you didn't want what everyone else was having, like the penis dogs. - What's a penis dog? - You know, it's like a corn dog, breaded corn dog? - What's a breaded corn dog? - Yeah, it's like the penis is in the middle and the breading's the condom! Well, anyway, when it came time for us to go to our lunch, well, we lesbies went off to the annex portion of the building where we'd eat our sub sandwich and chicken salad. But hear me out here. So, since only a handful of us were sent to the annex to have lunch while the rest of those Mr. and Mrs. Populars went off to main cafeteria, we on the other side were queens. I remember that V, Veronica, always tasted like chapstick, but she had the most amazing lips. It always matched room temperature, as I recall. Meanwhile, Haley was a cold fish. We had good lunches.

And you could hear the chimes, the melody, it goes so far, far away. I remember that feeling, you know, like the anticipation of what it all meant. Before I knew it, my brother and I were at the front of the truck, 'cause it arrived at our house. Sometimes it came by too quickly though, and the satisfaction wasn't quite there. Like, you know when you were wanting something so bad that the build-up is the best thing about it, and the actual feeling in the end isn't as much? You know what I mean? Like, it wasn't the orgasm you thought you were building up. Like it was a letdown. I wish I could... I wish I could just shut up. - Say it, whore, say it! Get motherfuckin' whore money! I earned every goddamned dollar of my fuckin' life honestly! Never in my life, never think my daughter would be a whore, a cock-suckin' whore! Whore, say it, say it! Motherfuckin' whore! Never in my life! Daughter does this to me! Never in my life would I think my daughter would be a whore. Cock-sucking, common, drinkin' whore! - It didn't really hurt. I don't know if it's that I'm just used to it, or that I got stronger, or tolerant, or numb. I still feel, I feel you still. Know what I mean? It's like that guy on TV, that Indian guy that says you can conquer all, your pain, your everything that hurts you, ails you, bothers you, and with one push on your head with his hand, you are cured and you feel nothing. Give me a countdown. - What? - Give me a countdown. You know, like 10, nine, eight. - Okay, 10, nine, eight. - No. Not so fast. Do it slow, please. - 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three. - Say it, please. T-t-t-two. - Two. - Say it! One. What he wanted to say then, he clearly couldn't say. He couldn't even form the words that would describe what would become an incredible hatred. Not a hatred directly against her, but for whoever made her become what she became. He called these the horrible, the awful elements, the ones that would ruin everything. But the forces who could take anything that was good, anything that ever meant anything meaningful and good, good he kept seeing, and then just ruin it all, just ruin the happiness, and that's all whatever the forces that he had reckoned and struggled with. These were the ones ruining his happiness, and so the rest had to go. But he was very humble. He never stole anyone's happiness. He was only selfish to a point. But he said "thank you" whenever he felt he had received the correct service at a diner, for example. And even though he didn't really show his appreciation to any man or god, he felt the reverence. Time seemed to stand still for Brandon and operated at a slow crawl, increments, decibels, micro ions. He didn't know what it all meant. For Jeanie, it was the start of a life. And for Brandon, while it had the joy of a life, the beauty, while it all stood still for him whenever he was with Jeanie, it just ended when she came to his world, because she hadn't come from there. She was a gift, as Stephanie had told Robert, but the gift was actually meant for Brandon. He'd waited all his life for someone who would look at him, just acknowledge his existence. He never knew when the person he was next to knew if he was even there. He just wanted to know he was there, and Jeanie told him he was there. Hi, it's me, leave a message. - Day 301. It's a big number, isn't it? I thought about the first time we went out, and me being crazy when I was back then, I asked you out for a midnight date, and you accepted, to my surprise. Do you remember that? No, you looked so beautiful. You didn't say a single word, but I knew it in your eyes. You really believed in me. I could see the love. I saw your smile. It was late and you had no makeup on, and I saw you. You, that's what I remember of you the most. I just don't want to lose those memories. Now I don't even know if you have them anymore. Was I there? I don't even know if it was, but I know I saw you. You existed and you were there for me. And I, I was a... For Brandon, it was easy. He knew who did it, who corrupted Jeanie. This elite group, they controlled everything, the media, banks, state parks, commercial real estate, ecology, the environment, technology, and everything that he had ever missed. It wasn't even intuition, because Brandon knew. He had felt this woman, the woman who had destroyed every feeling he had ever felt in his life, a woman so selfish, so absorbed, so charmed with the immediacy of being accepted by anyone, even the homeless, wig-less, thief scumbag taking a shit on the curb. His acceptance meant everything to her. It was obvious the way Stephanie had corrupted Jeanie. She had done it so expertly. - So today, we're gonna start with the basic principles of what we're trying to achieve. And by that, I mean we're going to try to blend the metaphysical with the physical, and that way, we can get to that level of euphoria that's so important for mental health. - Cool. - So we're gonna begin with the basics. - Okay. - Just sit up straight with me. And we're gonna start by facing our thumbs together. Beautiful, and now you're just gonna wrap around your neck, and just, I like to kinda ease into it. Beautiful. And now we're gonna find that beautiful sweet spot. You got it. Why again, Steph? Haven't you learned by now it's not about being insatiable? You want too much, and now you're using others to do it for you. Don't sacrifice this girl, please. She's young, she's innocent. Just let her live her life for once. Let her find love, disappointment, let her live. Will you give her a chance? I see her eyes, her eyes show that she has a chance, unlike the others. How do you feel? - Good. - There you go, perfect. Yes. A little more. Oh, yes, yes! Yes! There you go. There you go. Yes. You got this. ♪ All give or take till I carry the pain ♪ ♪ Your walls between us keep me far away ♪ ♪ There's no way back ♪ ♪ Your heart is full of bricks ♪ ♪ I'm trying to move on ♪ ♪ Raise my head to the horizon ♪ ♪ Wanna know what's to come ♪ ♪ I'm scared to be alone ♪ ♪ Stuck at the same place that we've been ♪ ♪ But I cannot get out ♪ ♪ Doors open, doors close in my heart again ♪ - So, who did you say recommended me to you again? - Jeanie. - Right, Jeanie. I saw you after hours because of her referral. I don't normally do that. Brandon, I can only help you if you talk to me. Why did you contact me? What is troubling you that was so urgent? How is Jeanie? Is there something you want to tell me about Jeanie? Are you in a relationship with her? - Like a little sister. - She's like a little sister. That's all she is to you, a little sister? You seem to be upset about something relating to Jeanie. - I lost somebody. - Did something happen to Jeanie because of you? - No, no, I'm. - I can't hear you, what did you say? Brandon, you have to talk to me for me to help you. Did something happen to Jeanie? We've already gone over the hour allotted, and I don't think I'm helping you because you're not telling me anything to give me a chance to help you. Brandon, I don't think I can help you. I think you need to call a different therapist. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - No. - It's getting late. - Sit the fuck down! - There's no need to get upset. You can tell me what's bothering you. That's what I do, that's what I can do for you. I can help you get through this, but you have to talk to me. All right, now this is starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable. I have to go. I really mean it... - Sit down. - It's time to go, I really want you to go. - Sit the fuck down! You sit and stay the fuck right there! - All right, I'm staying. Okay. - But I want you to leave. I want you to get the help you need, and I don't think I can do that. - No, start. - Please leave. No! Where is she now? You know. I'm so sorry. You did it nicely?
