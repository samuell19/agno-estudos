Karen? ♪ Karen ♪ Come on, wake up. Why? I need inspiration. Is it working? You're beautiful. You're so young. You're gonna break my heart. I've never broken one single heart. I don't believe you. I swear. Girl scout. The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. Hi, Ramsey. You wanna come with me? Shh. Fuck! Shh. I know, I know. Hello, little. I'm here at the lake house again. And I hope you'll forgive me. I'll bring you here again sometime soon. I promise. And I hope you'll forgive me. I'll bring you here again sometime soon. I promise. Hello, little. I'm here at the lake house again. What are you doing? You scared me. Have you seen a dog? My dog's missing. I'll keep an eye out. Could you drive me around to look for him? I'm gonna be in so much trouble if I don't find him. It's going to be dark soon. Just until it gets dark. You shouldn't just ask for rides from strangers. What's your name? Karen. Now you're not a stranger. You're from LA, right? Yup. That's so cool. I'm gonna be an actress. I'm really about shaving. Are you? I don't know. You're good at it. Maybe you should try looking again in the morning. Oh my God, these guys are always here. Hey! Do you even have a dog? What? Do you? Why would I lie about something like that? I don't know. Well, I'm not. We just passed him! I'm serious, I saw him! Stop! Damn! Bingo! Come here, Bingo! Shit. Come on, Bingo! Come here, boy! No one actually names their dog "Bingo," by the way. If you don't believe me, why don't you just leave? Come here, boy! Come on, Bingo! I'll be damned. Why would you leave me, huh? Don't you love me? Where do you live? You can just drop us off at your place. It's late. Your parents are probably worried. I don't live with my parents. Okay. You have a dog too? Yeah, someone took him. If anyone ever took Bingo, I'd kill 'em. Yes, I would. Let's go! I'm Lana, by the way. See you tomorrow. What's tomorrow? Tuesday! You staying long? No. Hello? Hi. It's... it's Karen. Hey. Hey. This place is different than I expected. What did you expect? I don't know. You want something to drink? I'd rather smoke. I keep forgetting it's legal here. You still have to be 21. How old are you? 19. You can get in trouble. I've done way worse. You want some? No, thanks. They were my favorite pair of jeans. I always cut them and make them too short. What are these? Look like I could've made 'em. But you didn't. So? So I could sell them for a lot of money. It's more about the process than the result. Like the emotion of the process. I get that. I like this one better, though. Oh. That's nothing. I wish I had a talent. I'm sure you do. Why? I don't know. People in this town don't have talents. Can we play this? Yeah. You don't know how to? It's okay, it just means you're young. I wish I was old. Why? So I could do whatever I want. You're only old when you know what you want and that you'll never get it. That's sad. Yeah. I love this record, I can't believe it's here. Aren't they all yours? Yeah, I just... I forgot. It's sort of popular. Or was. I... I don't know if it's cool, really. I remember the first time I heard this song. I was a freshman in college. I was at this guy's apartment, and he had a roommate that was older who I had such a crush on. What happened? Everyone had sort of left the room before he put this one on. We were sitting next to each other on the couch... just listening. I thought he was going to kiss me. But instead, he walked over to the corner of the room... and then he put his arms around himself like this, and he kind of just... danced the entire song with his back to me. I don't think he even knew I was watching. It's like I wasn't even there. It's funny how things matter so much when you're young. I like it. What? The song. It's good, right? Tell me if it looks as cool when I do it. Do you think I'd be any good... as an actor? I... I don't know. I've never seen you act. Aren't you gonna answer it? I'm not really supposed to be here. Who is it? My ex. Don't call here again, you cheating piece of shit. How'd you know? Men are scum. Did you see one? Yeah. How'd you do that? So you put your mouth in a circle kind of, and just like blow out with your... tongue, I guess? When are you going back to LA? I don't know. I don't have a... specific date. When I feel like it. Wanna see something cool? Sure. Okay. Just hit it. Should we put it out? Yeah. You wanna take it? Souvenir. That's a good souvenir. No one's me. I know, just don't talk. Am I blinking? One more time. Okay. One, two, three. Morning. What's this? Breakfast. Where'd you get these? I'll show you. Once, when I was little, I peeled a clementine... and I held it up on my finger... just like this. And a little bird swooped down and grabbed it off my finger. It was a like a little oriole or a sparrow or something. It wasn't any bigger than the clementine, and yet he managed to just pick it up and fly away. It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. It got ruined, though. Why was it ruined? No one believed me. Where's your place? Just across the lake. Where? You wouldn't like it. Why not? I'm not really supposed to be here either. There's this guy... Tommy, he's older. He's gonna take me to LA. When? Soon. You should be careful. Why? There are people out there that'll take advantage of you if you let them. Why would I let them? Never mind. You're cool. You are. Shit. Hello? Anybody home? Just a minute! Hey. Hi. I'm Beau. I do repairs, check on the house. I think I noticed your car a few days ago. So, um... what happened to the window? I don't know. Was there a storm? No, nothing too bad. You okay? Yeah, it's nothing. You should be careful. It's not very safe. That garbage bag won't keep out an animal that wants in. Plus... that guy right there looks like it could come down any day now. I mean, I got some limbs off the roof but, uh, could be more. Especially if we do get one of those storms, you know? It looks fine to me. Huh. Well, you're the expert. Did you see that? Very good. Will you come swim with me? I just want to sit here for a minute. Come on! Maybe in a little bit. Who's that? Just this guy. He's doing some work on the house. Mind if I use the bathroom? No. Shh. Watch this. Woo! Woo. I told Beau he could swim with us. I thought you said this was a pool party. I didn't say that. Yeah, you did. Cleared all the branches for you. Great. Woo! Where'd he go? Gah! Beau, stop it! You're not gonna swim? Come on! Yeah, come on! Beau, stop. Did you see that fish down there? What? Look. You guys have fun. Wait! Here. Hold onto me. We live in the most beautiful place in the world, don't we? I think it's boring. You're boring. Beau. Yeah? What if Karen sees? Sees what? She's a dyke. And not your mom. How do you know? I know. I could call the police, you know. I'm not leaving without Ramsey. Stay as long as you want. You don't get to invite me now. I broke in. I like knowing exactly where you are. And what you're doing. You don't know everything. D. Come here. What? I wanna show you something. Shh. What are you doing? It was right over there. Pow. Why'd you do that? Just for sport. Come on. Where are you going? Lana? Lana? Hey! Come on. What? He's coming. Hey, stop. You're hurting me! Don't do anything stupid. What's wrong with you? Hey. You okay? Yeah. You good? Cold? Maybe. Here. Thank you. You're welcome. Are those for s'mores? Yeah. I'm like a boy scout. You're awesome. I know. I can't help it. Oh my gosh, Karen. I'm gonna get sticks. Okay. What are you doing? Like, what is this? She's not gonna... come up here after you, if... if that's what you think. So you're supposed to be watching me? Is that the deal? She's just worried about you. Okay? That's all. What does she think I'm gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. I mean... This was just a cut. It was an accident. What did you say? What did you tell her? Nothing. What did you tell her? Nothing. She did this. Karen? At the end of your message, press one. I'd burn this whole fucking house down before I kill myself over you. Hey. All right. Where you headed? I have plans. Cool. Oof. Can I get you another one? Um... Y... uh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Hello? You answered. Lana? Yeah. Are you okay? Do you think you could come pick me up? Can we just go? Wanna get ice cream? Was that a yes? I didn't hear you. Yeah. So, how old are you, really? I'm sorry, it's just... sometimes, you seem... Like a liar? No. I'm not a famous artist. I know. You're still an artist, though. Tell me about your ex. When we first met... I went by her studio... and she asked me what I thought about this painting that she was working on. I told her I didn't like it, even though I did. Why? I don't know. And she tore it up. Completely destroyed it right in front of me. Why'd she do that? I think she wanted me to feel special. Did it work? Yeah. That's nice. It wasn't nice. Would he hurt you? Tommy? I don't think he cares if I'm dead or alive. Please don't take me home. Can I braid your hair? What? Why? Okay. All done. Go look. Do you like it? Yeah. How'd you get so good at eyeliner? Practice, I guess. Will you teach me? Tomorrow. Okay. I'm scared. Are you? No. Does anyone know that you're here? Then there's nothing to be scared about. Can I sleep in here? Yeah. Are you going to sleep? Yeah. Okay. Me too. All right. What are you doing here? Stayed over. You should be careful. She's not who you think she is. And what makes you think I'm so innocent? Oh, so you're a dyke now too. Maybe I am. Yeah, right. You're an idiot. It was supposed to be a compliment, you know that? I'm just saying, a lot of guys think you're hot. I mean... I do. You said that like you thought of it. Everybody's thought of that. I just wanted to try it on. Do you mind? Come here. Close your eyes. You're so young. Do you like it? Yeah. Don't you like me? That doesn't matter. Yes, it does. I'm old. Not yet. Please. Take this off. Don't look at me. Hey. Sorry. It's okay. It's not you. Tommy said that he had a friend... who knew this producer in LA... and that if he liked me, he'd introduce me to him. So last night we went to the house... the guy with the friend or whatever. Where I picked you up? It was a pretty normal-looking place except... there was this camera where a couch would be. I hadn't really thought I'd... have to be filmed or anything, but that's pretty normal, right? I've never... been to an audition, not a real one. But the guy looked at me and said that I looked too young. That nobody would touch me unless I looked 18. And I said that I could change and... put some makeup on but... he said that less was more. Or something like that. That I should just take off my shirt, that it was babyish. And Tommy just sat there and he didn't say anything, so... I don't know, I just did it. I told them that I... I didn't want to be a model. That I wanted to be an actress. But he said it was all the same in LA, that... his friend would have to see way more than a girl in a bra if I expected to be seen for anything. That the girls in LA were crazy. That they'd do anything for a chance to be seen. Do you think that's true? I don't know. He said it didn't matter, though, because he could tell that I didn't want it. That I'd never make it. And then I got kind of mad then... so I did it. I stood there and I took off all my clothes. And I stared at the camera for a really long time. And there was this... white sheet, like a backdrop, and then some lights, and after a while, I couldn't really see him or Tommy anymore. It was just me. And then he told me to turn around. His friend would need to see something like that. That's when I could tell that... the sheet wasn't white, it was kind of grey with some yellow stains on it. And I realized this guy didn't know anybody in LA. And I was gonna turn around and tell him that but... I didn't. I liked being told what to do... and knowing that they had to be looking at me. I hadn't really realized how dry my mouth was... or that he had taken it out. It was like... you could hear it before you could see it. And then he was just standing there jerking off... while Tommy was laughing, and then... then told me to turn around and... so I did. I'm so stupid. No, you're not. Yes. No, you're not. It's okay. You're here now. You're with me. Come here. It's okay. I just want it to disappear. Yo. What the fuck? Yo, what is it? Who are you? Give me the camera. What? Give me the camera. Take it off the tripod. Yeah, have it. It's not even worth that much. Get the fucking camera! I'm going! Put it on the couch. Get in the room. What? Get in here! Jesus. Get in the closet. Close the door! Did you think you would get away with it? Did you?! Who... who the fuck is she? What do you mean "who the fuck is she?" Okay, okay, go. Go. Oh, come here, boy. Did you tell her all this was yours? Did she listen to your stories and... make you feel big and important? You mean like me? Yeah. Why are you here? This is my house. You can't fuck with me anymore. I'm here. Isn't that what you wanted? Where is she? Who? Lana. The little girl? I took her home. You shouldn't have done that. She's bored and she's a liar. It's not worth it. I'm so sick of your lessons. I'm not like you. And what am I like? Old. Come here, boy. Come here, boy! Come here! Where's Lana, boy? Come on! Okay, fine! One, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, four, and five... and seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Julie? All right, one sec... Julie! Mom! You said you would help me... Okay, I will! Mom, we're hangin' out! Now! Okay, fine. Excuse me. Julie, who was that? Hi, I'm Julia Lawson, I'm 16 years old, and I'm from Florence, Oregon. Now what? Show us something cool. I can make myself cry. Okay. What is she doing? What else would you like me to do? Take your top off. Shh. Shut up. Chill out, dude. I thought you wanted me to hook you up. I do. Okay, turn around. Yeah! What are you doing? D left Ramsey here for ya, if you want him. Said I could take him to the shelter if you don't. Of course I want him. I changed the locks on the doors. I know. New window's open, though. Thank you. Such a good boy. Lana? It's Julia, actually. I know. I heard what you did. Where is it? In the lake. Thank you. Did you watch it? No. Good. Can I see you again? I don't think so. Why not? You're a good actor. Then why do I feel so sad? You shouldn't have called here. Was any of it real for you? No. Then you're a good actor too. I'm just old enough to know better. Don't call here again. Karen?
