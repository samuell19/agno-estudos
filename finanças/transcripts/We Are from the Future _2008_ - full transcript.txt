You are probably tired. - Milk restores energy. - Thank you. - Huh? - Come on. - We should pay for it. Grandma, how much do we owe you? What are you saying, "owe"!

You don't understand Russian? Maybe you'd like it in Chinese? So, you talk Chinese? Comrade corporal, may I? No! You will speak when asked. - Elin. - Here! Go to the lake, check everything! Clothes, documents, firearms. Make it fast, but quiet. Roger that! So, you were escaping the Germans through the lake? escaping the Germans through the lake. Yes Fine. Get up. Let's go. Cover your swastika tatoo. If anyone sees it we'll be shot without a trial. Take your watch off. Shoot those defectors. What do you mean "shoot"! You're a reasonable, soviet citizen! If I may, comrade lieutenant major, It may seem completely delirious but we're your descendents. Yes, we're from the future. 2nd World War is long over. - Very long ago. - And? Did we win? - Yes. - Yes, we won, just like we wanted. May I, comrade Political Advisor? There was a lot of bombing, they could be contused. All at once? As we can see, that may be possible. Comrade lieutenant major, may I? - Here, I found their documents. - Where the hell were you! Yes, 12th division, 131st unit. Comrade Political Advisor, that' right 131st was trying to make it out through the German ring. Looks like these are the only survivors. The whole unit died in front of their eyes, clouded their minds. Well, happens Ok chief, let's decide what to do. with the contused. GERMAN SPEAKER: Russian soldiers! (It's been 2 years since your country is in this giant war.) (This war was started by Stalin and his Jewish gang from Kremlin!) (It's a way of Jews nationals fighting for global revolution) (to implement their dream of enslaving nations just like they enslaved you.) SPEAKING GERMAN So, Borman, are you going to feed us bullshit that we are all hallucinating? Maybe we're asleep and it's a dream? Right, all of us, together! We've got a situation here, we're in the past. What do you mean "The Past" ?! Our heroic PAST! Wait, let me get this right, are we all going to die here? Finally it sunk in. I want to go home. Home - is good. Just too early. Get dressed. Here brother. Here, take it Really, you were really lucky today Commander was in a good mood. Otherwise... Otherwise what? Otherwise it would have been otherwise. Comrade Corporal, many defectors? It happens. They run, get caught and shot. What did you think? In War you can run only 1 way: forward. Then you might make it through alive. Look, not bad guys, real "Armani". - Awesome outfit. - What did you say? I said very good clothes, Comrade Corporal. Very good clothes. Why, did you wear something different? - Just like Huan's Sombrero. - Look in the mirror, assface When are you all finally going to shut up! Do you think you're still in charge?

Do you really want to know today's date? Well? August 19th, 1942 Oh-oh.. We got here through the lake, so the only way out of here is through that lake. We can't make it back during the day, we'll get shot. So, we stick around and don't move till dark. - Yes. - Only after dark we'll go to the lake. - Here they are - some bullshit Common disorientation.

I think the moment was appropriate. (SHOUTING: Yes!!!) Where are we going to spend the night? - Comrade corporal! - Quiet. - There, give Petrovich some more. - There is enough for everyone. So, you're after nurses now? Looks like I'm not the only one. Are you asking for it? Want to be smudged all over these trenches? We shouldn't be like that here, Borman Where is your comradeship Did you just call me Borman? - Why did you call me Borman?! - My fault, Sergey Nikolaevich. - Quiet! - Get out of here. - Got it. Little to the right, just like that. (SINGING: I'll give you, my dear, a hand crafted handkerchief) (Show it to everybody But don't tell them about our Love) I'm going to go dry it Well, what do you want? I'm entitled to the change of bandage. Even brought some flowers. Hang in there sweetie. - Thank you. - Quiet, quiet. Jesus! Get out of here, we're short of bandages, your scratch can be treated with a little disinfectant. - And how long have you been fighting? - Longer than you, that's for sure. - How long do you think I've been fighting? - Why would I even think about that? I have plenty of my own thoughts. Get out of here, poor bastard. Get out. Please forgive me, Nina. And.. I'm very interested to know what a girl is thinking of as ... About the usual: when the war is over, and the happy life we're going to have Well, we'll win the war, I guarantee you that. I can't promise the happy life though Unfortunately Interesting. What else do you guarantee? Cities will be rebuilt, skyscrapers in Moscow. - Skyscrapers? - You'll fly to space. Fly to space?! (OUTSIDE: Trucks are here! Load up the wounded!) Hold on a little longer, they'll operate soon, you'll be ok. Careful. See that he doesn't get shaken up along the way. That's about it. Maria, where do I take it? Who is this? Special Unit. I think he's here after us. Listen, Cherep, soldiers talk about advancing soon, we got to take off as soon as possible. What about Motherland? Who's going to defend Motherland? We're as good defenders as a grenade made out of turd. Watch it, bro. Got to go to the lake, if we get lucky we'll come out in our happy future That is if we get really lucky. On the other hand, it'd be better you get wacked here. It'd be better if you get wacked, and I'll live a little longer. Got that? And not in this screwed up past, but in my future Because I find it more interesting. To shout "Hail Hitler!" and kill poor immigrants? - Go to hell! - So then you go to jail and eat shit. Only you'll go there before me! And why is that? Very simple, you'll be a junkie addict with your black Rap music. Dumbass! - Who's dumbass? - Yes. You're dumbass. Your. Quit that! Attention! Look. Attention. If you hate each other so much, how did you fight that you survived? It's called - undermining of military capacity of a military unit in combat, another words - treason. - Treason of what? - Motherland. One more time, you'll be court-martialed. Funny, digged out over there, digging in over here Startuk, do you have a heart? Got to be humane Most important for us is not to end up here instead of them Got to do something, or I'll go crazy I beg you, calm down. When it gets dark we'll go to the lake. God, please remember the names of our fallen. And calm their souls in the light of Your face In the name of the Father, Son and the Holly Spirit today, before and forever. Amin What's up, infantry, what news do you want to hear first: good or bad? Bad. Well, there is no booze anywhere. And the bad?

So, did you do it? Did you? Did you? Did you! Enough, sort it out later, we have to go to the lake. Let's go - Why are you taking the rifle? - Without it we're defectors. Chuha, sort it out later.

You, three, after me! Oh, pure Arian. Listen, Cherep, maybe you can chat to your people so they'd let us go, huh? Very funny. Why, they are like your family. Who will sign the capitulation? From the Soviet Union: Gen. Zhukov, from the U.S. Gen. Patton - from France... - What?! France?! These cowardly half-Jews also won over us?! Of course. It's a part of anti-Hitler coalition. Watch your step. Damn, legs are killing me! Didn't I tell you to watch it! Drink. You're brave soldier. Eat. I don't eat after 1st. What about Hitler? He shot himself in the office basement. How is that possible?! How can you win?! You! Pig! Do you have any idea what is German Military Machine?! Mainshtein, Guderian, Paulus, Fon Klaist! Here, in Stalingrad, from Autumn 1942 - Jan 1943 will be massive battles in which your famous Paulus will end up in a very tight ring and will be captured. and us, starting with Volga will start to advance, and slowly, slowly, slowly advance... towards Berlin - Guys... - How is it? Asked to pass. Here Take it. - Won't eat, bastards - Nice to meet you, local - Filatov, Sergey Sokolov Dima What did you say was your name? Sokolov Dima Dima, do you have a cigarette case? - Yes, only it's empty - Can I take a look? Lets... - Let me take a look? - Here. - What's that engraving? - "To devotion to Revolution. By commander Budenny" My grandpa gave it to me, when I was going to War - Give back. - Hey, stop it. - Give back - Give back the cigarette case - Don't give back. How did you find out about the cigarette case? corporal Emelyanov told us. Remember him? Yes, great man. - He saved my life - Ours too. He died. - How? When? - When he was covering our retreat. - I'm so sorry. - Feel sorry for yourself instead. - It's war. who's feeling sorry for themselves... - its true - ...only fucking cowards. Not everybody is a hero, like you. - Who would know about that if not you. - I'm not following you guys. If you do, you'll shit your pants. Especially when you find out that in 21st century, skinheads will walk Moscow streets dressed in black with Nazi symbols, raising their hands yell: "Hi Hitler!" Are you fucked in the head? - Huh - What did you say?! - Get off me! - I'll strangle you bastard! YELLING IN GERMAN MACHINE GUN SHOTS Bitch! Tomorrow they'll execute us, and there will be no right or wrong Will be! There always be right and wrong. Our path is right! And never in Moscow will somebody shout "Hi Hitler" Never, never, don't worry Alright. Enough. We're short of time. Got to get out of here. I'm digging a way out here. Nice! That's one hole! - And where are we getting out? - Guys, dirt is soft! - There is a guard! - Only one. He's by the door. If we're quiet, he won't hear Then what? I saw, when we were lead to the interrogation, there is a trench about 100 yards away - But there are Germans there. - Can't you jump over the trenches? Who's going to figure out who you are in the dark? They'll shoot of course, but that'll be up to you, guys Why "you" and not you? I can't. My leg .. That bastard guard broke it when he was kicking me. - Well, what's there? - I think this is it. Stop coughing. Bitch, broke my tooth GERMAN SPEECH Ok, you first. If he makes it through, the rest will too. Come on. Wait. Here. Give it to my mom. Come on. K-Kh-Kha Oh God. K-Kh-Kha ...

But these buttheads came back in one piece. Not a single scratch. Magic. Where, where the justice? I'd like to know! That corporal alone was worth a whole unit.
