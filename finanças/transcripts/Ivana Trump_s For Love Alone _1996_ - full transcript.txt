♪♪ Adam! Drinks later, perhaps? Yeah, that sounds great, Peter. We'll see you then. Who was that? That was Lord Fawley. Seems pleasant. Ha ha. He has to be. I just acquired 8% of his stock. He's vulnerable to a takeover. Is there anywhere in the world we can go where you aren't reminded about business? Aspen was your idea. It wasn't criticism, just a comment. Yeah, right. Thank you. Makes me feel as if I can fly. Which trail? Uh, Little Bear. Don't let me hold you back. Adam, please, I can't sort it all out by myself. And I can't read your mind. Oh... I'm not about to dissect our problems freezing my tail off on a mountaintop. -Then when? -I don't know. We'll talk later. [crowd cheering] [announcer] Katrinka Kovar is the winner of the World Cup. [woman] Congratulations! [crowd laughing, bells clanging] [man] Katrinka, congratulations. -[Katrinka] Thank you so much. -[man] For what? [woman] If you ever left your film lab, you'd know that the women's ski team just won the World Cup. [man] Uh, you know, we ordered the pork roast but all they seem to have is sausage. Don't complain, Tomas. At least it's meat, maybe. [laughter] -[man] Is that you? -Yeah. Are you an actress as well as a model? I'm a student and a skier. I model sometimes for my expenses. I'm Mirak Bartos. Everyone at this table knows who you are, Mr. Bartos. I'm starting work on a film here in Prague and there is a small role for which you have the perfect look. If you're interested, call me. Are you going to do it? I don't know. Tomas thinks Bartos' movies are terribly low-brow. Oh, he made one or two movies, good ones, early on. Mirak Bartos' career was going nowhere until he married the daughter of the head of the secret police. You should do it, Katrinka. It'll pay better than modeling. Do you know how beautiful you are? I'm glad you think so. I think you could have a career in film. Acting is pretending to be other people. I'd rather be myself. And a beautiful, totally appealing self it is. Thank you. Are you in love? I've had no time to be in love. Well, I find that difficult to believe. It's true. Are you? What? In love. More so by the minute. You're married. But, uh, we live very separate lives. Does that shock you? No. Let's walk. I'd like that. It was a most wonderful evening. I don't want to leave you. I don't want you to. You're not very experienced at this, are you? I have never made love before. [Mirak] You're incredible. [clatter, footsteps] Katrinka. I'm pregnant. Oh, my God. Are you sure? Oh, Katrinka. Oh, my love. It's going to be all right, I promise you. I'll take care of you. I need a little time. Don't do anything until you hear from me. [knock on door] [Katrinka] Ahh. I thought you weren't coming. I'm here. Katrinka. I love you. You mustn't doubt that. But I can't leave my wife. I... I can't destroy my career. And that's what a divorce and acknowledging the baby would mean. Don't look at me like that, I'm not abandoning you. I've made all the arrangements. I'll come with you. Arrangements for what? An abortion. I don't want an abortion. I want my baby. I want to keep my baby. You can't mean that. I do mean it. You'll lose your place on the team. Your government stipend. You won't be able to finish university. How on earth are you going to support a child?! I can model. -[Mirak] While you're pregnant? -I'll get a job. [Mirak] Look around you, there are no jobs. My parents will help me. Papa. I want to kill him. Because you can't let yourself be that angry at me? I could never be that angry with you. I only want the best in this world for you. Because that's what you deserve. Mirak Bartos is not the best. Mirak is no longer a part of my life. This baby is. I want to keep it. And to love it the way you love me. I don't want to be angry, Papa. Or bitter. I just want to go on and do the best I can. How can... How can we possibly manage? I'll finish this term at the university. I'll continue to train with the team. No one need know I'm pregnant. Mirak has arranged a travel visa for me in June, so I can go to Munich. But what then? No one must know but I'll stay in Munich. I'll defect. [Milena] Katrinka! We'll never see you again. You will, Mama. Things have to change. Freedom will come someday. At least in Munich, I can find work and support myself and my child. I'm sorry to have done this to you. We love you, Katrinka. [distant bells ringing] This will be your room. Your board has been paid through October, and all the arrangements have been made with Dr. Zimmerman. Katrinka? I'm sorry. It's lovely. I was just thinking how... this is the first time I've been anywhere, just me. Not as a member of the team or my parents' daughter. Just Katrinka. Well, you're not alone. You're very kind. Have you worked long for Dr. Zimmerman? Ten years. He's a marvelous doctor. And he completely understands your situation. I admire your conviction and your courage. But... for your baby's sake... as well as your own... allow me to arrange an adoption. No. No. I thank you, but no. [Zimmerman] I urge you at least to consider adoption. You want every advantage for your baby. A child needs a father, family. Real security. My child has a father who would not accept responsibility. I will. Thank you, Dr. Zimmerman. [door opens] See you later, Erica. [telephone ringing] [Erica] Hello? Hold on a minute, I'll get her. Katrinka, there's someone called Tomas for you on the telephone. If he's calling drunk from a party to tell me.... film is the voice of freedom... [Erica chuckles] Tomas. Do you know what time it is? No. No, tell me. I understand. Thank you. Erica! [Erica] What's happened? My parents. In the mountains. There was a convoy of Russian tanks. My parents' car went off the road. They're dead. -Oh, Katrinka! -My parents are dead! [groaning] [Katrinka] Baby. You're so cute. Yes, you have beautiful eyes. [Zimmerman] Listen to me now, Katrinka. Your parents are gone. There's no one you can depend upon. There is no question but that you must go home for the funeral. But how can you come back to Munich? And if you take the baby with you, neither of you may ever come back again. You know the life that faces you as an unwed mother? Even more painful now without the support of your parents. I don't know what to do. Allow me to arrange an immediate adoption. I know a young couple. They're educated, wealthy. And loving. But how? Sign the release form. Then your son will be safe and secure and... in his own room tonight, with a mother and father prepared to devote a lifetime to loving him. It is the responsible thing to do for your little boy. [baby crying] Mrs. Graham, I had a call from Paris. The gentleman said it's regarding a Renoir painting he's been trying to find for you. Thank you, Carter. Mr. Graham will be an hour late. I'm afraid dinner plans are uncertain. I'm prepared for any eventuality. [phone autodials] Paul Zeiss. Mr. Zeiss, Katrinka Graham. Have you found my son? I regret that my report is the usual one. We have found no trace of male child Kovar born October 7, 1970. Shall we continue the search? Yes, please. [man] ...rest in peace with the Lord. Perpetual light shine upon thee. Amen. Mirak. I want to go back to Munich. I want to find my son and make a life away from here. You want to defect. Yes. [Mirak] I can't help you, Katrinka. Or rather I won't help you. [Katrinka] Why not? Because your decision was the right one. For you and the child. I feel as if there's nothing left for me in Czechoslovakia. But what about an Olympic gold medal? That's what you've been training for. That's what everyone says you're going to win. Where does Austria begin? [Susannah] Below the right fork. About 100 yards beyond the last line of trees. You know, I heard that in the '64 Olympics, the Russians were training here. One of them tried to defect. Broke his neck trying to make that run at night, under a full moon. [sighs] Come on, the coach is waiting for us. -[woman] Watch for ice. -Susannah? Go! [exhales] Go! -Katrinka! -I can catch her! [door buzzes] Katrinka! I'm so happy you're safe and that you called me. If I can stay with you for a few days till I find my own place? Of course you may. I'll get my old job back at the hotel until I can reestablish myself modeling. It won't take you long, I know. But first and beyond anything, I want my son. Katrinka, your son is with loving and very wealthy people. I don't know who they are or where. And Dr. Zimmerman has instructed me to tell you that he will not see you, nor will he accept your calls. [woman] Come on, girls, ten minutes till showtime. Oh, yes. Marvelous. [man] Turn around, my dear. Now, tell the truth, did they sew you into it? -Yes. -Can you sit down in it? Not on your life. -[Natalie chuckles] -Here you are, my dear. You look wonderful. Good luck. [whistle blows] Arggh! -Hi! -Hi. Are all these people waiting for taxis? Yes, it's totally impossible. I'm Natalie Bovier, head buyer for Galleries Gillette. I'm Katrinka Kovar. Come have a drink with me until this thins out. I would love to. [speaks German] Oh, Natalie, I shall be back at the hotel at 7:00. I'll be there. That was Jean-Claude Gillette. Himself. He's incredibly attractive. I agree. We're lovers. He's married and it's hideous, but... I adore him. I know the pain involved with loving a married man. Who was he? Film director in Prague. [Natalie] You must have been a child. In many ways. -Are you in love now? -Yes. But not with a man, with a place. -Oh, really. -It's called the Golden Horn. [Natalie] That charming guesthouse? I know it; I've been to Kitzbuhel with Jean-Claude. It's owned right now by this marvelous old couple who've promised to sell it to me and stay on as managers. Well, aren't you the clever girl. -Do you ski? -Mm. After a fashion. Well, when the Golden Horn is mine, you must come as my guest and I'll give you lessons. Oh, I'll look forward to that. You wanna marry? Absolutely. After a grand and passionate romance. He'll be full of life and energy and want to accomplish things. He needn't be rich, although I wouldn't object. He'll want to laugh and to dance and to ski. He needn't be handsome, but he should be incredibly sexy. And he has to love me desperately. Whoever he is, I hope I meet him soon. Well, whoever he is, I hope you do too. [Katrinka laughs] [indistinct conversation] [doorbell jingles] -Hello, Karl. -Good afternoon, Miss Kovar. We're fully booked for the weekend. Oh, good. If this keeps up, I can stop modeling and just move in. -Is Natalie upstairs? -Miss Bovier is shopping. She said she will meet you for dinner. [man] We can't wait, my darling. Before the clock strikes, the big hand has to move here, and we have to meet Mama at the hotel, OK? -Come on, you. -We can solve that problem. Oh, no, mustn't touch. You're absolutely right, but in this case I can, because it's my guesthouse and it's my cuckoo clock and I wanted to enjoy it. That's very kind of you. -My pleasure. May I pick you up? -[boy] Yeah. What a big boy you are. Oh! [cuckoo calls] [boy] Cuckoo! Cuckoo! -[cuckoo calls] -There you go. -Whaddya say? -[children] Thank you! You're welcome. Come back soon? -Yes. -OK. [man] You have a devoted clientele for life. They're absolutely a delight. [man] See you again. Bye now. -Bye. -[boy humming] [man] Come on. Come on. [man] Come along. [woman] Miss Kovar? -[Katrinka] Yeah. -The Hellers. We stayed with you in December. Of course. Good to see you again. -Auf Wiedersehen. -Auf Wiedersehen. -Bella donna! -[Katrinka] Alberto! Bella figura! [chuckles] [man] I hate to bother you, Miss Kovar, but I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Adam Graham. [Katrinka] How do you do? How did you know my name? [Adam] I was eavesdropping in line. [Katrinka] It's Katrinka Kovar. Katrinka to my friends. [Adam] You sure seem to have a lot of friends up here. [Katrinka] I own a small guesthouse. -The Golden Horn? -Oh, I know the Golden Horn. It's a charming place. Just like its owner. Yes. It is nice. I know, I know, that was a lousy line. I get stupid around beautiful women. You seem quite composed to me, Mr. Graham. I'm, uh... kind of on unfamiliar ground here. Why do I doubt that? [chuckles] No, I mean, I've never skied this trail before. [Katrinka] It's fast at the beginning. -I like fast. -I don't doubt that. You cold? I don't wear much under my suit. I'll hold the thought. [Katrinka] I'll be fine once I'm moving. Wait a second. Wh... Where are you going, Miss... Well, damn. This woman at the table to the left of you has been staring at you. Mm. Sabrina. I saw her on the way in. [Katrinka] Who is she? Gossip columnist based in New York. Internationally syndicated. Mean as a snake, but very amusing. I'm rather fond of her. She's run a couple of items about Jean-Claude and me. [chuckles] His wife was furious. [man] Adam. The couples at the door? [Natalie] Mark von Hollen and his wife Lisa. He's a newspaper publisher, New York and London. They're devoted to one another. Word has it he's even faithful to her. He was at the Golden Horn this afternoon with his children. Who's the other one? [Natalie] I haven't a clue. Stunning woman. Isn't she? Uh-huh! No "uh-huh." We had a brief conversation on the slopes, and he's... obviously unavailable. [Natalie sighs] For Miss Kovar. Thank you. [horn honks, tires screech] [knock on door] Mr. Graham. Miss Kovar. I, uh, convinced them at the Golden Horn to give me your address in Munich. That was very enterprising of you. I guess you'd better come in. No, that's OK. These... These are for you. Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you. I, uh... Will you have dinner with me tonight? Uh... but the lovely lady at the Excelsior. Lucia di Campo? Uh... business associate and my lawyer's wife. I'd be delighted to have dinner with you. I'll pick you up at 8:00. Maybe you'll show me the apartment after dinner. My father's the ninth generation of ship builders and yachtsmen, out of Newport. I have three commercial yards of my own, too, on the East Coast. One in Washington state. That's my resume, basically. Uh... I'm off tomorrow morning to negotiate for a yard in Breman. What kind of ships do you build? What kind do you want? Everybody thinks I'm crazy to expand into Europe in the middle of an economic slump, but now is the time. Tell me why. So I'll be ready when things turn around, which they will. Wanna hear more about your escape. Oh, there's nothing to tell. A new life was possible if I did what I had to do, so I did it. You make it sound so simple. No. There was loss. And pain, but... in the end, the choice was clear. So, I imagine, was the risk. Yes. But... next to skiing and good champagne, I love adrenaline. So, how about buying the Golden Horn, was that a risk? No, that was security. And joy. Come stay with us next time, when you're in Kitzbuhel. Unless, of course, you need to spend a lot of money at the Excelsior to prove you're having fun. Do you object to spending money? No. No, just to wasting money. To wasting anything, really. Time. Knowledge. Experiences. Or the opportunity for romance. That too. [woman] We'll be home in just a minute. [child whines] It was a splendid evening. You're wonderful company. You're not inviting me in. I'm not. [chuckles] I might suggest that this is a wasted opportunity. I have an early call in the morning and you have a flight to Breman. Good night. Good night. Good night. [telephone rings] Hello. You're there. I've been calling all day. Where have you been? -Do you have your shipyard? -[Adam] It's too soon to tell. But... listen, one way or the other, I'm gonna be in Munich tomorrow night. Where would you like to have dinner? I'm driving to Kitzbuhel tomorrow afternoon. No, you're not. You're staying in Munich and having dinner with me. You're not the only one with business to take care of, Mr. Graham. Look, have dinner with me in Munich and... I'll go out to the Golden Horn with you Friday. And stay the weekend? I can't. -Oh... -But I will. [chuckles] You have a deal, Mr. Graham. Good night. [Adam] Open up in the name of the law, please. [chuckles] Special delivery, room service. Telegram. Something, please. [Katrinka] You did it. -We closed this afternoon. -Yes! Now that you're here, I guess you better come in. I'll get some glasses and we'll celebrate. Wait a second. Don't you wanna have dinner first? Katrinka! Yes. Marry me. What? Marry me! Yes! Catch that? -[Katrinka] Yes! -Yes? -[Adam] Beg your pardon? -Yes! -What? -Yes! Yes! I am so happy for you. Oh, I love him desperately. I want to share his life. I want to live in America. It feels like the greatest adventure. But if I leave Munich, I leave behind the hope of finding my son. [Erica] Have you told Adam about him? No. If he's well and happy, I can't disrupt his life. Katrinka, if I could have helped you, I would have done so long ago. But the truth is the child could be anywhere in the world. Let go. Love Adam and have many beautiful children. You know, I have to be in California next week to oversee a yacht we're building for Prince Khalid. -Who? -Khalid ibn Hadir. Well, rich, even by Middle Eastern standards. Anyway... what was I saying? Oh, yeah. In, uh... in Malibu, there's this... there's this estate overlooking the Pacific. It's Nick and Lucia's home. And I can't think of a better place for a wedding. -Next week? -Why not? You can invite Natalie in from Paris. Nick's already volunteered to be my best man. We each have our closest friends as witnesses. But what about your parents? They're on that cruise in the Mediterranean. Whatever we do will be fine with my father. And whatever we do will not be fine with my mother. So... we only have to please ourselves. It would please me very much to marry you next week in Malibu. Another one, please. You're lucky you don't have the IRS on your back. -Ta-da! -[Katrinka giggles] [gasp] Look at you. You are, of course, the most beautiful bride. Thank you, Lucia. Ciao, bella. You 're beautiful. [Lucia] Katrinka, Natalie, may I present to you the Prince Khalid ibn Hadir. Will you forgive me? I've invited myself to your wedding. I'm absolutely delighted. Mademoiselle Bovier. Allow me the additional honor of becoming your escort. [Madame Bovier] Oh. And I thought there was nothing that could make today more perfect. [Katrinka giggles] Well, we seem to be all organized except for one minor detail. [Nick] The groom. I left him on the phone to Tokyo, but he said don't start without him. Why am I not surprised? Well, the day's off to a great start. I just sold a tanker to Sugimoto. Congratulations, Adam. -[Katrinka] Congratulations. -Thank you. I have an even better deal for you. Oh, yeah? What do you have in mind? Well... I, Katrinka, take thee, Adam, as my lawfully wedded husband... to love and to cherish, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. [Adam] With this ring, I thee wed. And I pledge you my fidelity. And I promise you... the most extraordinary, excessive, successful marriage two people ever shared. [playing notes] Look what you've given me. Ah, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Oh, it's been such an overwhelming year. I was just thinking about my parents. How they would love you for loving me so much. Tell me this party's gonna be a success. And that this apartment is everything you ever wanted. -And more. -Yeah. -Are you nervous? -Oh, in a panic. It's gonna be a great party. Come on in, Carlos. Oh, the king of interior design. -What do you think of your work? -Our work. And it definitely deserves a celebration. So, uh, Natalie and Khalid are coming. How did you know that? I was saving it for a surprise. [Carlos] Sabrina's column. Sabrina wrote something about the party? I thought you knew. -Do we have a paper? -There's one in the hall. Oh, look, she even managed to get a wedding picture of Natalie and Khalid. Why would Sabrina write such terrible things about me? She doesn't even know me. Get used to it. Publicity is publicity. At least she spelled the name right. Yours. I don't wanna be known as Adam Graham's Katrinket. You know... I kind of like it. -Just kidding. Kidding. -Fix your tie. [indistinct conversation] Jeffrey, I owe you a big one for getting me into the Graham party. [Jeffrey] That was a wicked little number you did on her in today's column. [Sabrina] Huh. Euro trash. She's going to fall flat on her face, and I'm going to love writing about it. Oh, Sabrina, you are such a bitch. Yes. [playing ballad] ♪ For love alone ♪ I did what otherwise ♪ I never could have done... Thank you very much. [woman] Katrinka, I'd like you to meet my friend. ♪ And aimed a few too many arrows at the sun ♪ [man] We really love this place. ♪ It has been fun ♪ When I was sure... Katrinka, you have very decorative friends. Carlos, it looks even more beautiful full of laughter and people. Jeffrey Cross just arrived and he's brought guess-who, Sabrina. Thank you, Jeffrey. Have some more champagne. I'll be right back. Jeffrey! Sabrina. I'm so glad you could make it. I wouldn't have missed it for the world, really. I'm so impressed. Thank you, but really I owe it all to Carlos. He spent months refining my barbarian tastes. -May I quote you? -Please do. No, really, he's worked so hard. He deserves all the credit. I'm sure he does. Have a lovely evening. ♪ And from the ashes ♪ Like the Phoenix I will rise ♪ ♪ And sail the skies ♪ For nothing dies... [woman] Congratulations, Katrinka. -Hi! How are you? -Carlos, this is spectacular. Would you like to take on a leaking London townhouse? I'm on the next plane. Oh, before I forget, the children. Whew! It's a cuckoo clock. It's not as elaborate as the one they liked at the Golden Horn, but it's authentic. They'll be knocked out. Thank you so much. -Mwah! -[woman] Katrinka. -Oh, excuse me. -Of course. [Katrinka] Natalie! Have you recovered from the honeymoon? -Mm-hmm. -Are you happy? -Mm-hmm. -You look wonderful. -I'm pregnant. -That is the best news. Mwah! Khalid, congratulations. Thank you. You are the first to know. Now all I need in this life is a three-hour lunch with you. Tomorrow. Here comes Carlos. I'll go find Adam. ♪ When I was sure... Katrinka, it's a grand slam. Congratulations. It's amazing what money can buy, isn't it? [Lucia] Adam, you beast. Katrinka's worked herself to death for months over this. You should be ashamed of yourself. He's never ashamed of himself. It's one of the things I love best about him. -Come, let's go find Natalie. -Excuse me. I could strangle him. Wasn't it great Natalie could come? -Mm. -She says Khalid's so protective, she feels like she's under house arrest. Oh, come on, Natalie knew what she was getting into when she married Khalid. Well, she knew but she didn't know. But she's thrilled about the baby. I want to have a baby. Oh, God. Yeah, yeah. We've got two whole weeks in Paris. Wouldn't it be great to conceive a child in Paris? Oh, sure, but, uh... let's try for Manhattan. [Adam] Sure. How soon? You got it. -Merci beaucoup, garçon. -All right. All right, my friend. I look forward to it. Be well. Bye. Ho! [sighs] I just told Mike I'm in the market for a film studio. Adam, that's such an unpredictable business. -What do you know about it? -As much as you do. Maybe more. Really? Why? Because you got a bit part in a movie and slept with the director? No. Because I talk to your Hollywood friends, I read the Wall Street Journal. You can win a fortune, but you can lose, too. Are you worried that your standard of living might be reduced? What a mean and stupid thing to say. [phone dialing] You talk to me about your deals all the time. You claim you value my opinion... but apparently that's only when I agree with you. [Katrinka] Excuse me, can you help me? I'm looking for Rue St. Lazare. Of course, dear, it's quite simple. You go two blocks down on Boulevard Montmartre, make a right turn, and you'll be there. -Thank you so much. -Not at all. Miss Kovar, Mr. Zeiss. A pleasure. Won't you be seated? Your ad says you trace missing persons. Lost heirs, usually. Kidnapped children and adults. There's someone I want you to find under conditions of confidentiality and the utmost discretion. And the person is? My son. [humming] [sighs] Sad news this morning. Mark von Hollen's wife and family died in a fire last night in Connecticut. No. [Adam] Yeah, house burned to the ground in the night. He was in London. To lose your family... Your children. Oh, God. Look, I'll have the office send flowers. You need to pull yourself together if we're going to go look at this potential investment of yours. I have to be downtown at 10:00. I'll be in the car. [Adam] Wow! I used to come to this place when I was a kid. It was such a great hotel. [Katrinka] So, what do you think? [Adam] Uh... Let me see your figures again. Let's see... Well, I think... you should buy it. It's such a gamble. [Adam] The greater the risk, the greater the fun. Champagne and adrenaline, remember? Hey, if it doesn't work, I'm rich enough for both of us. Listen. Next year, I'm gonna be up to my ears learning the film business. It would be great for you to have a chance like this to occupy yourself. What if I get pregnant? That doesn't seem to be happening, does it? [sighs] Maybe if we both stop thinking about it, it will. Hey... do this. I'm behind you all the way. [telephone rings] -Hello? -[Paul] Mrs. Graham. -Paul Zeiss. -Yes, Mr. Zeiss. I'm afraid I have nothing new to report. And truthfully, I feel a little guilty. Not that I don't appreciate your handsome retainer, but... -you want to go on with this? -Yes. May I ask why after all this time? 'Cause no matter where I've been and what I've done, no day has gone by when I haven't wondered if my son is well and safe and loved. I understand. We'll persevere. Thank you. [Adam] So, do I get to go home with you tonight? -I hope so. -Yeah. -Oh, this is a triumph! -Hey, Carlos. For you and for the children of the streets. Carlos, who needs more help than a child? Exactly. -Where is Natalie? -I don't know. Let's go find her. Adam? I'm just gonna say hi to the Warner Bros. people. There you are. Try and get a moment alone with Natalie. -I think something's wrong. -Like what? I don't know, but she's not acting herself. Katrinka, isn't that Mark von Hollen? No one's seen him in ages. -Excuse me? -OK. I love what you've done with the place. -It's absolutely beautiful. -I know. Mark, I've thought of you so often. I kept your letter. It was enormous help. Um... I didn't know you lost your parents under those circumstances. I'm sorry. I never thought I'd get over it. It's taken me a long time to want a life without Lisa and the children. But I think I'm back now. And thank you for your invitation. I'm just pleased you could make it. Have you seen Adam? [Mark] I'm on my way. Save me a dance. Absolutely. [Natalie] Katrinka. [Katrinka] Natalie. Khalid has declared the Cyril his favorite New York hotel. We designed the penthouse with him in mind. [Natalie] This is spectacular. I'm so thrilled for you. Darling, are you all right? -Not exactly. -Can we have some time together? Hmm-mm, not this trip. We're flying back to Riyadh tomorrow. -Katrinka. -Sabrina. Princess Hadir. Hello, Sabrina. So, what do you think of the Cyril? I am trying desperately to find something to criticize. -[Natalie giggles] -Thank you, Sabrina. I think. -Excuse me. -Certainly. Natalie. Tell me something. Mm, that could be dangerous. This is off the record. Now, take a look at Mr. Graham. Could it be the great one is a little upstaged by his wife? [Sabrina chuckles] Ah, that was wonderful. It was great. Yes. Adam. You're angry. Come on, I'm tired. Of course you are, you've been working nonstop for months. Something happen tonight? You opened New York's premier luxury hotel. No, besides that. No, nothing happened. I have a suggestion to make. Could you and I simply go somewhere and... spend some time together? Where would you like to go? I always want to go to the Golden Horn. [scoffs] Why do you hold onto that place? It's barely breaking even. [Katrinka] I couldn't give it up, it's part of me. It's a rational business decision. -Hey, what is this? -Come on, Katrinka. I can't just pick up and go to the Alps. I have to be in London on Monday. And I have a hotel to run, but couldn't we just take off for a few days and just... What? I was gonna say "and love one another." What does that mean? To share things again. To feel that... life together is more fun than when we're apart. Is it? I've tried to make you proud of me. I've tried to live up to the role of Adam Graham's wife and I've learned so much about myself that I wouldn't have known otherwise. Which has been one of your great gifts to me. But if I'm losing you in the process, it seems like a very stupid exercise. No, no, no, no, look at me. You're not gonna make me the heavy just because I'm married to a woman who wants to have everything but can't accept the consequences of her own actions. You wanted it. You wanted me to fill up my time so you could devote 24 hours a day to your movie studio. Well, you have your studio and you have your shipyards, and I hope to God they've been keeping you warm at night because I certainly haven't had that opportunity. Well, I'll call your private secretary and I'll make an appointment. Maybe I've done too much, is that it? And you can't handle it because you need to be the star. Yeah. Yeah. [Katrinka] I don't want to compete with you. I want to love you. And if that's no longer of interest, you just better tell me now. I don't wanna do this. Let's go to Aspen before we go to London. You have dinner yet? [Adam groans] Yeah, at the bar. Did you have a good run? No. Nothing seems very good anymore, does it? I've tried, we've both tried over the past years, but... Are you as lonely as I am? Apparently not. What the hell do you want, Katrinka? [tosses boot] More than we have. Well, I'm sorry all this is so inadequate. I should have said, "I want you." I'm not so sure you know who I am. Oh... Can we just table all this, OK? I got calls to make and we have an early flight to London. Certainly. [door closes] Tell him it was their proposal. I approved it, and they're stuck with it. Good. I'll talk to you tomorrow. -[hangs up phone] -Sorry, static on the print campaign. We were due at Cheyne Walk seven minutes ago. [Katrinka] Adam, I'm in London because you wanted me to be. That doesn't mean everything in New York came to a stop. -How do I look? -You look great. You're the man who spent 2/3 of every vacation on the phone. You got to say what you have to say and get the hell off. Natalie and Khalid will forgive us for being 20 minutes late. I got important business with at least four people who are gonna be at this thing. Can we just get going? How can you criticize me for taking care of my business when everything in your life, including lunch with old friends, is just another chance to cut a deal? [door opens] [indistinct conversation] [woman] Mrs. Graham? Trudy Heller. We used to stay with you at the Golden Horn. My husband Claus and son Christian. Of course. How lovely to meet you again. Christian, I remember you from the bunny slopes. Oh, yes, me too. Adam. Adam, do you know the Hellers? Sure. Didn't we meet at the conference in Zurich? -[Natalie] Food, everyone. -[Adam] Hello, Christian. -How do you do, sir? -We don't want the caviar to get hot. Excuse me. Katrinka, cherie, I must take you away for a moment. I want to show you my new armoire in the bedroom. Come. You won't believe it. It was a bargain. Aziz is very social. [Aziz] A bargain. You can't believe it. It was a bargain. I want to leave Khalid. -Natalie! -I can't go back to Riyadh. It was bearable when we were spending time in New York and London, but now Khalid stays home all the time because of the political situation. I can't stand one more day of confinement in the palace. I can't go out alone, I have to wear the veil in public. And I can't stand the first wife. Does Khalid know how you feel? Yes. I still love him and he loves me. But he says, if I try to go, he won't let me take Aziz. I can't imagine my life without my son. My only hope is to get us both to America. Please. Please, help me. I'd like to have your impression of this one, too. [telephone rings] And, uh, I want to show you this one. -Hello, oui? -You'll have a look later. Yes, merci. Just a moment, please, I'm sorry. Oh, Katrinka. We need your plane at Heathrow on Thursday to take Natalie and Aziz to LA. Well, that's easily arranged. Um... tell Natalie I'm delighted she finally came back to her senses. The last thing she needs to hear right now, Jean-Claude, is "I told you so." But she'll be very grateful and so am I. Just let me know when you're ready to leave Adam. [Katrinka] Spare me your nonsense. -Promise me you'll be there. -Yes. You can depend on it. Bye-bye. [click] This is the important jewelry. This box is ready. -Passports. -I'll have them with me. -How dependable is the nanny? -Oh, completely. She'll have Aziz at the Gardens at 1:00 sharp. Perfect. Whew! -Hello. -Katrinka. I was trying to lure your wife into a shopping spree at Harrods -but she's been virtuous. -Oh, that's completely out of character. And then some. I'll just return these for her. Just one moment. Amal, Jelle. Take these boxes down to Mrs. Graham's car, please. I'll see you Thursday at the fox hunt. I have a treat for you, a marvelous mare I just bought in Ireland. -I can't wait to meet her. -Thank you, Katrinka. I love you. [indistinct conversation] [hounds barking, horses neighing] -[Adam] Khalid. -[Khalid] Adam. [Khalid] Jelle, make sure I have blankets for him when I come back. Whaddya say? Katrinka. How do you like her? She's magnificent. [Khalid] She is. [blowing horn] Well, we're off on time. They'll pick up the scent quickly in this weather. Go ahead. Who described this as "the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible"? [Katrinka laughs] [hounds barking] Bless that fox. Khalid's going to overtake the hounds. At least we know where he is for the next two hours. -Aziz? The plane? -Yes, all set. Good work, love. Hop right back in. Call me at the hotel tomorrow. There's no way I can thank you. [car starts] Bye. [Sabrina] Katrinka. What happened to you? The beast threw me. What in the world is going on? Natalie wasn't feeling well so she's going into London. She looked more distraught than ill. And wasn't that your assistant, Robin Dougherty? Come on, Katrinka, spill. Or let me find out on my own, and believe me, I will. Sabrina, you and I haven't been friends. But I respect you. I'm going to tell you the truth, with the understanding that Natalie's future and the happiness of her little boy depend on you keeping your mouth shut. -Am I clear? -Perfectly. [Katrinka] Natalie's life with Khalid has been a minor hell. If all goes well, she'll pick up Aziz in Kensington Gardens within the hour and be on a private flight to America before Khalid realizes that she's gone. That is the story of the year. Which you are not going to write. What you're going to do is come with me into the house and we'll have a head start on the hunt feast. Mrs. Graham, you are some piece of work. [phone rings] Yeah. No, you gotta be kidding. No, she's right here. Khalid wants to speak to you. Yes, Khalid. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can tell you. Certainly. If I hear anything from her, I'll have her call you right away. Goodbye. Where is she? Somewhere over North America. Khalid is the single most important client of Graham Shipyards. If you've done anything to jeopardize that relationship, I'll wring your neck. A fleet of tankers is supposed to mean more to me than my best friend and her little son? Natalie asked for my help and I gave it to her. But don't worry, she's on Jean-Claude's jet. Khalid will hardly trace that back to you. [telephone ringing] Hello. [Paul] Mrs. Graham. Paul Zeiss. Robin, will you excuse me for a moment? Oh, sure. -Mr. Zeiss. -Some good news at last. One of my operatives has found, in a warehouse, cartons of Zimmerman's files, an inquiry from an attorney, Herbert Belin in Lucerne, about adoption papers for a male infant, Kovar. Mr. Zeiss. It's too soon to celebrate Mrs. Graham. -Belin retired to Zurich. -[knock on door] We're working full time to locate him there. But I did want you to have the interim report. -Thank you. -I'll keep you informed. Goodbye. What are you doing here? I got to fly to LA tonight, looks like for about two weeks. -I'll go with you. -I'm gonna have my hands full out there. -I wouldn't be able to spend any time with you. -You won't have to. Natalie and I will go to the spa. I don't want a continent between us, Adam. You're right. Terrific. And after LA, we'll go to Kitzbuhel. Yeah? Yes! [Adam] Listen, yes, I said I'll be there and I'll be there. Yeah, all right. Meetings... -I've got meetings all week. -[Katrinka sighs] [Adam] Why don't you go on ahead to Kitzbuhel and... and I'll be there in time for your birthday? Oh, Adam. I know, I'm disappointed, too, but maybe once I get there, I can extend, huh? Maybe I'll fly to Paris. Do it. In the meantime... an advance birthday present. Thank you. You're welcome. The bad news is that Mr. Belin, the attorney who contacted Dr. Zimmerman about adoption papers for your son, died in Lucerne three years ago. The qualified good news is that his practice was taken over by another lawyer who is willing to provide a list of the clients he acquired from Belin. This means a long and costly paper trail, which could lead to nothing. But if your son's adoptive parents are on the list, it could also result in contact. Shall we go ahead? You know the answer to that Mr. Zeiss. Jean-Claude! Do you realize that following you down a ski slope is an intensely erotic experience? You're outrageous. How does Helen put up with you? Probably in much the same way as you put up with Adam. [chuckles] I haven't seen you since the great escape. Natalie was eternally grateful to you. Mm. You and I were a pair of fools, were we not? What do you mean? You really don't know? What? I didn't get Natalie and your husband did. What do you mean? You're such an innocent, and I wish you weren't. What or whom do you suppose is keeping Adam in California while you're here? How do you know Adam's in California? Natalie told me, of course. Natalie? Yes, my dear, Natalie. Shall we? [shower running] [Adam chuckles] [Natalie and Adam laughing] Don't let me interrupt. I just came to return my birthday present. And to tell you I want a divorce. [Adam hits wall] -[Adam] She's in a meeting? Can't you do better than that? -[door slams] You're not gonna negotiate a divorce settlement in the newspapers and you're not gonna make a fool out of me in the gossip columns. Publicity's publicity. At least she spelled the name right. [Adam] Where the hell did she get that picture? -Hmm? -[glass shatters] That wasn't paparazzi, that was taken in our living room! Better in the living room than in the shower. Call her off, Katrinka. I didn't call her on. You spend your entire adult life courting the press, so how can you be surprised when they write about you? [telephone ringing] If that's your lawyer, tell him he's got himself a game of hardball. [ringing continues] Hello. Paul Zeiss, Mrs. Graham. I'm very sorry to give you this kind of news, but... Dr. Zimmerman committed suicide this morning in Munich. Apparently, he was in very bad health. We'll continue to make our way through Attorney Belin's files, of course, but at this point, I am not overly optimistic. I'll keep you informed. Thank you. [door opens] Are you all right? I feel like I've lost everything. Adam's being impossible. Every time I reach an agreement about something, he changes his mind. I think Adam's just realized he's made a major mistake. He'll never marry Natalie. And I'll betcha he'd come back if you'd let him. I won't. I can't. All the money, all the women. All the children in this world weren't enough to... satisfy Adam. And Adam's success wasn't enough for me. I wanted to experience everything, you know. But in the end, what really matters turns out to be so simple. Someone to love who loves you. And work to do which gives you pleasure. Course, what else is there? Since someone to love doesn't seem to be an option right now, I'm going to concentrate about work. If I may say so, I think that you should just get out of New York for a while. And do what? Well, I'm opening offices in London. And I've bought myself a little house in Mayfair. Katrinka, there's this marvelous old hotel for sale in Knightsbridge. Come to London, buy it... And we'll do the hotel together. [chuckles] [doorbell chimes] [Mark] Katrinka! -Mark! -[Mark] Welcome to London. I heard about the hotel. I knew you were in town, but Carlos wouldn't let me call because you were working around the clock. You wretch! So, um... make the most of your day. Thank you. I'm sorry about the divorce. It is a nightmare. Adam's a master tactician and... delay seems to be his tactic of choice. I can't say I blame him. Will you walk with me? Yeah, I'd like that. Does it ever go away? [Mark] Ah, I think about the children every day of my life. But it's bearable now. You're the only person who dares to broach the subject. [Katrinka] I should think it would help to talk about them and to remember them and to feel close to them. [Mark] Precisely. You're really very gifted. At what? Living. Thank you. I wanna make love to you, Katrinka. Life is so short. So short. I hate to waste it playing games. I can't go into that hotel with you because in 20 minutes, the whole world will know about it and Adam will use it to make more trouble. Come on with me. Say yes. Please! Say yes. How could I say anything else? Yes. Excuse me, but Mr. Graham is here. She knows who I am. Thanks. Adam. Yeah. I'm in London a lot these days on business. I don't know, I just realized that there's nothing I'd like more than to spend a quiet country weekend with you. To discuss our situation, of course. What do you say? Wanna drive up to Cambridge? -No. -Oh. I'm sorry. Should be. [chuckles] No, I mean I'm sorry you won't spend the weekend with me. According to our friend Sabrina, you're involved with an actress. [Adam] Well, you know better than to believe what you read in the gossip columns. Although I must say, I'm kind of enjoying being single again. You're not, and you won't be until you sign those divorce papers. I really have missed you. There's a lot going on I'd like to talk to you about. I need an extension on the deadline. I had to mortgage the apartment, which means... the title isn't clear, which means... I can't assign it to you. Then keep the apartment. Keep the apartment and sign the papers. OK. The deadline stands. [doorbell buzzes] Is it official? As of 6 p.m. London time, my divorce is final. -Congratulations. -[Katrinka chuckles] Celebrate here or on the town? Oh, here, definitely here. [telephone rings] Let me deal with that and I'll tell the board no more calls. Glasses are on the table. Hello. Mrs. Graham? Mr. Zeiss. We found your son. I can only begin to imagine how you must feel. I trust myself. More at this point than ever before in my life. My son's in Kitzbuhel at the Excelsior for the week. I'll leave tomorrow. Not necessarily to introduce myself but to... see him. And if I can manage it, to talk to him. And then I'll trust myself to decide what's right for him and for me. Want me to go with you? No. But thank you. [man] Ready when you are. Hey, Christian, let's go! Let's go! [laughs] -Who are you? -Christian, isn't it? [Christian] Christian Heller. [Katrinka] Katrinka Graham. Used to come to the Golden Horn. We met a few years ago at Prince Khalid's party in London. I knew I recognized you, but who knew you could ski like that, huh? I'd forgotten I could myself. I was on the Czech ski team before you were born. Would you like another run? I'm not sure I could do it again. May I offer you tea at the Golden Horn? You bet. -Do you still own this place? -I do. My friends, the Hubners, retired, but a young man from Gstaad manages it for me now. I love it here. It was the best part of my childhood. -Really? -Yeah. It's nice to hear that. My parents sent me away to boarding school when I was 6. But they'd collect me at holidays and we'd come here and I could sort of pretend we were a normal family. Weren't you? A normal family? No, not really. My father was in the diplomatic corps and changed posts every couple of years. They decided boarding school would give me some structure. I was a real handful. Perhaps I didn't like being adopted. Did your parents tell you that? [Christian] It would have been better if they had. A nurse got mad and laid it on me when I was about 5. But if they adopted you, they must have wanted a child very much. They must have loved you. In their own way. I think they liked the idea of a child. Did you ever wonder about your birth parents? All the time. Did you ever try to find them? No. I figured they probably wouldn't be interested. When's your birthday, Christian? October 7. I have a son who was born October 7, 1970. He's my age exactly. Where is he? [Katrinka] I've been trying to find him for many years. I gave him up for adoption when he was born. You must have been very young. And frightened. My lover was married. My parents had just died suddenly. I... I didn't know what to do. I made a terrible mistake. One I've regretted ever since. Why are you telling me this? [Katrinka] So that perhaps you'll understand... and forgive. Forgive who? Me. You? You're my mother. [Katrinka] I found out yesterday who you are and where you were. I took a plane from London this morning. I didn't come to tell you, I just came to see you. If I've upset you, I'm sorry. I'm not upset. I'm just sort of stunned. So am I. I didn't think I'd like you. And? God, I... don't know. Here's my number in London. And this is my permanent number in New York. Please think about this. And call me if you want to. I hope so much you will. Auf Wiedersehen. Auf Wiedersehen. [rings] Hello. [Mark] It's Mark. I'm so happy you called. I wish you were here. Give me five seconds. I'm in the lobby. What? You'll drive yourself crazy waiting around for this call. Why don't we go outside for a while? Yes. If Christian calls, the switchboard will tell him where we are. Thank you. Christian, Mark. [Christian] Hi.
