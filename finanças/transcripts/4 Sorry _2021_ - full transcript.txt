Did you inform anyone about you visiting us? No. Did any police vehicle follow you while you were coming here? No. Switch your phone off. Why? Our boss is number one on the police encounter list. There's a good chance they'll kill our boss using you as the bait. That's why I'm asking you to switch the phone off. I did it. Boss, I've checked everything. All clear. Coming in with the client. Nobody can go near the boss without his permission. Whatever it is, say it from here. Bhai has already told you, right? He told me. Still, you tell me. My husband needs to be murdered. Should he be mauled to death or burnt to death? That doesn't matter. He should be killed, is all. This is his photograph. I don't need any photographs. How is it possible without a photograph? If Vicky confirms a client, all their details, in and out, will get inside my database. Your details, too, are already there in my database. Usually, at 10:00 AM, he... That's not necessary now. You don't have to give me any information. I'll take care of everything. How are you gonna kill him without knowing anything about him? Your husband should die. I'll take care of that. I don't disclose my plan details to anyone. In case, if you get caught by the police, you might rat me out. It's top secret! I'm not revealing it to anyone. Nobody will get it, including you. Pay 50 percent of the money as advance now. We'll collect the rest after finishing your husband. Hey, bearded loser, won't you ever listen to me? I'll deal with you now. How many times should I tell you? Don't look at my wife while she's out hang-drying the clothes. Why are you shouting? I swear I didn't look at her. I married her after a lot of struggle. Yeah, your head says it loud and clear. I won't spare you. I'm not just gonna keep talking. Please don't shout. I'm with a client. I'm doing business worth many crores. Please leave now. How many times do I need to tell you? - You eat rice or something else? - Pizza too. Brother, I swear I didn't look. I was just showing off with this, it looked like I was ogling. Let's be honest, Fish-face Kumar. Is your wife worth ogling at? You do whatever you want, cheat whomever you like. - But don't look at my wife. - Uh-oh, she's staring. - Don't piss me off. - Just a minute. After this has been dealt with, it's your husband. Get lost! Nobody can step out without boss's permission. - Get lost! - It's my order! I'll not let go of Pushpa. If you keep rambling like this, nobody would wanna live with you, let alone Pushpa. Hello. - Bhai. - Yes, madam. I met the guy you had set me up with. He doesn't look like a goon at all. They look like frauds. They might look like that. But they get the job done. Bhai, no need. I'll find someone else. Please listen to me, dear. I can arrange someone else for you. Bhai, it's okay. No need. If my wife complains to me ever again, I'll become furious. Fish-face, she's complaining to you but hooking up with someone else. - Go, save her! - Who's that? Come here again, I'll paint you in red. Get inside. Nobody's trustworthy. - Dude, where? - Here, Boss. - Where's the client? - She left. - What? - She slapped me and left. Why did you let her go? Go get her. - Hey! - Hey! - She left, boss. - Hey! Call that bhai. Hello. Bhai, boss wants to talk to you. Hello bhai, what kind of customers you have! She spoke fully about the project, then left without an advance. She doesn't trust you. What? Doesn't trust me? Bhai, did you not tell your client about Vicky? Ask her to get the payment ready. We'll get it once we finish the project. Don't do anything like that. - Okay, thanks. How do I proceed now? You got what I'm saying? Handle it carefully. Sir, coffee. Anything else, sir? - Some hot water. - Okay, sir. - Boss? - Yeah. Is this guy her husband? Or is he the reason why she wants her husband dead? I'm confused, Boss. Dude, call her and tell her that we've killed her husband. Boss, we haven't killed him. Please don't waste it, Boss. It's ringing, Boss. Not picking it up, Boss. Keep calling her. Boss, she's cutting the call. Keep calling her until she picks it up. Okay, Boss. - Pick it up and talk. - Mmm-hmm. Hello. Hello, madam. Our boss has killed your husband as per plan. Idiot! Cut the call. - Boss! - Did she call you names? Yeah. We called her and told her we killed her husband when he is with her. Of course, she'll curse. Boss, you are a terrific scientist. Don't praise me too much, man. I don't have candies. Come praise me in the evening after 6. Now, keep a close watch on her. Hey, Toad-face. You keep watching this aunty while I go follow that uncle, and finish him when it's time and I'll call you. - Don't forget to collect the payment. - Okay. Be careful. What's she doing? Okay, okay. That's not a problem. I'll get it done for you. Yeah, but it'll take a week to ten days. But I'll definitely get it done. You don't have to worry about it. It's my responsibility now. Consider it done. They said he is a businessman. Why has he come here? He shouldn't escape. Him being alone makes it easy for me. I'll finish him soon and leave. No, no. The project that you mentioned, it's not possible to finish it that way. No,no. State ministry won't be of any use here. Please understand. Yeah. We need Central's support as it's a huge project. Yeah. You're sounding as if it's too simple. Yeah. It'll definitely cost ten crores more than what you had quoted. What are you talking, man? So many from various states are vying for this, you know? Please understand that first. To acquire this one in spite of all these issues is not easy. He's alone. This is the right opportunity. Project is ours for sure. - How do I kill him? Money doesn't matter if we get it. - I need a weapon. Hammer! One blow will finish him off. We can't finalize it over phone. Hammer. Skull would weigh around 400 pounds. If both of them clash, his brain will collapse in one single blow. Yes! My calculation! Hey! Who are you? Hey! Who is this guy? Hey! Who are you? Hey! Who are you? Tell me! Who sent you? Why did you try to kill my boss? - Tell me! - Hey. - It's paining, sir. - Hey. Who are you? Why did you want to kill me? I should manage somehow. The truth will come out along with your tooth. See for yourself. Hey! Hey! Tell me! Sir! My tooth! My tooth. Tooth. Hey! Tell the truth at least now. Why did you try to kill me? Who sent you? Hey! Speak the truth or die! I'll tell you, sir. Please leave me, sir. Sir, I'll tell you. Sir, it's your wife who paid me to kill you. - My wife? - Yeah, sir. What are you saying, man? Sir, I swear I don't know anything. Your wife hired me to kill you, sir. Your wife, sir. She's the one who's fair, slim and good-looking. Must be younger than you. She asked me to do it. I don't know anything else. Please spare me, sir. Oh, my tooth. - Hey. Come here. - Boss. What, Boss? What is he saying? He's saying my wife hired him to kill me. I don't think it's true, Boss. No. She's also been acting strange for some days now. I'm not sure whether to believe this or not. The one I married, She wants to leave me I'll send her off, Sour grapes Okay, you do one thing. Dispose off that body. - Okay, Boss. - I'll call her here. - Okay. - We'll find out. - Okay, Boss. - Go. Come. You come too. - Hey - Boss? Bury this one and dig two more graves by the side. In case what he says is true, bury them both together. Why did you ask me to come urgently? "Why?". Do you recognize him? - Who is she? - Who is he? Oh. You are acting as if you don't know because you got caught? What? I got caught? Who is he? What did I get caught for? Hey! Tell me the truth! Sir. I swear, your wife asked me to kill you. What do you have to say now? He has told the truth. I swear I don't know who he is. Hey! Tell me! She's the one who told you to kill me, right? She? It's not her. It's not her. It's your wife who hired me. What? Are both of you pretending now? I don't have a clue about what's happening now. Please believe me, I don't know him. Even I don't know her. Please believe me. I guess I need to torture you more for the truth, right? Hey! Tell me the truth. She told you to kill me, right? She's not the one, sir. Sir, I'm speaking the truth. You wife, not her, wanted me to kill you. Are both of you trying to trick me? I'm gonna kill you. Sir, please don't shoot. See, I have a photo of you being intimate with your wife. Give it to me. Who is she? She's his wife. - Wife? What's all this? - Hey! She's my client. She's his wife. Look at the fourth picture. They'll be really intimate. What's all this? - Are you cheating on me? - You kidding me? Hey! I'll kill you first and then I'll kill her. - Oh, God. - Did you shoot? Oh, God! My dear! What happened? Get up, dear! Oh, God! Please wake up, my dear! Well-shot, well-done. You shot well. Please give me my phone. My dear! Smile. Thank you. Please wake up, my love. My love! Please wake up, my dear.

Show the photo and collect the payment right away. Okay, Boss. - Go. Did you like the diamond ear rings photo I had sent you? - Yeah, it was gorgeous. - Okay. - Hello, madam. - Yeah? My boss called me just now. He has murdered your husband as per your plan. - Look at the photo, give us the money. - What? - I asked for a photo. - Here it is. This is my husband's photo, sir. - Advance? - It's in here, the amount you asked for. I'll give you the rest as soon as you finish the job. Okay. - Sir? - Tell me. I won't get caught, right? Don't worry. We've carried out a lot of murders. None of our clients get caught. It won't look like a murder. We'll frame it as an accident. - Don't worry about it. Where is he now? - Okay, sir. He's in Mumbai now, sir. He's just left for the airport. - He'll reach here before evening. - Okay. After getting out of the airport, your husband won't come home, he'll go to heaven. - Okay? - Okay, sir. Is this guy her husband? Or is he the reason she wants her husband dead? How will you kill him without knowing anything about him? That's not necessary now. You don't have to tell me anything. We called her, told her we killed her husband while he was with her. What do you expect she'll do? Sorry! Don't worry, man. I'll take care of it. - Why are you in a hurry? - They are coming. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Hi.

Oh, is it? You're looking handsome. The name is "Sham". But it looks like a girl's message. Who's this? You've started to ignore me already. After marriage, you'll completely ignore me. All the nights we spent together are unforgettable. I miss you so much. I'm seeing you. Please don't avoid me. Okay, dear. Come and meet me in my room. Hey. - You spoke to sis? - Yeah.

I'm feeling very uneasy. Please adjust this dress a bit. Hey! Hey. What happened? Are you all right? Nothing. Please wait for a couple of minutes. I'll go to the rest room, I'll be back.

Please try to understand. - We'll talk about this later. Please leave now. - What? - Go. She might come anytime. - Is there any problem? - Go, go, go. - Tell me. Hey! Looks like someone had come? Nobody came. I heard a woman's voice while I was in the rest room. Hey. She's my office colleague. She came to wish me. Oh. Is she so close to you to come to the bedroom and wish you? Yamuna, she's insane. Not just with me, she's inappropriate with everyone in the office. She sends me odd messages now and then. I usually ignore them. Why do you have to talk about her and spoil our happy moments? Stop kidding. When did I ask you to come? Stop kidding. - Okay, okay. You messaged me to come up, right? When did I message you?

You cheated on me. Yamuna, please listen to me. Don't say a word. Please. Please. Don't show me your fucking face! Just get out of here! I don't know how to make you understand. What do you have to say for this? Tell me. Answer me! Hey. It's just... Just lust? What do you mean? If you had truly loved me, how can you lust after some other woman? I loved you so much. You cheated on me. - Yamuna. - Keep your hands off. Please. Don't make any wrong decisions in haste. Please. Yamuna, please don't tell anyone. Hey, Yamuna. Please! Please. Please try to understand me. Please! Yamuna, please! What happened, dear? Why did you slap her? What's the problem? Ask him. What's the problem, son? What happened, dear? They're asking, right? Tell them. Nothing, Mom. I was just talking to her. Yamuna misunderstood it. Hey, Yamuna. What happened? Why are you crying? Why did you slap that girl? Tell me what the problem is. I'm asking you, you're not saying anything. Leave her. You know her, she'll take time to become normal when she's upset. You go. I'll convince her to come back. Go. What happened, dude? I warned you not to invite her. See what happened. How would I know that she'll message me and she'll come up to the room? I asked you to cut your ties with her before the engagement. See what happened. Dude, your dad is coming. What's the problem between you two? Okay, you need not tell me. You said you loved her. You said you wanted to marry her. Now, you have to step up and solve your problem with her. Will your problems go away if you keep drinking? Go. Bring her back. Go. I understand, it's easy for me to console you but you're the victim. You've been in love for four years, now, you've gotten engaged too. Lots of good memories. Because of a few bad memories, don't make any wrong decision. Life is all about ignoring small mistakes. Think twice before you act. Oh, God. I think you'll understand my pain now. I'll act right if you act right. But if you make a mistake, I'll do it too. What's the problem, dear? You aren't telling me anything. Tell me. What's the problem? We can talk it out. - Son-in-law! - Why are you hitting him? Ask her. They loved each other. They wanted to marry. Now they're fighting. This won't work out. We'll stop this. You can't say like that. Engagement is over. - All relatives have come. Now... - We can't do anything about it. We'll end this now. It'll become a mess if they get married and wants a divorce later. This won't work. Let's separate. Sir. Please. Sir. Sir. Let's not decide in a hurry. You came like the calm before the storm I understood why the snow melts You threw your smile missile at me I became new after this explosion, From then on - What's happening? I blabber, I'm swirling - Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - Scribbling poems endlessly I come in front of you And pretend it was an accident - Here's the money. - Okay. - Dear. - Yeah? Shall we close the shop? - Selvi. - Yeah? We'll wait for some more time. The debt collector guy will come in the morning tomorrow. Ammu will be alone at home. Selvi. Let's make ends meet, educate Ammu and get her a good job somehow. If my parents were alive, I would've gotten a good job and would've taken care of you guys well. Our hardships doesn't matter. We should educate Ammu and give her a good life. - Selvi, they're coming to our shop. Get ready. - Okay. I've reached Chennai. I'll eat and come. You don't need to cook anything. See you later. What is available now? Idli, Dosa, minced Parotta and meat, sir. What? Get me minced parotta and meat. Dad, I'm really scared! Where did they go, man? - Don't know, Boss. Search. - They are not here. Search properly. Search every nook and corner. Ravi, did you search there? Who's there? Search there properly. We shouldn't spare them today! Search! Search well! Come. Come fast. - Mom, I'm scared. Maari. - Maari, don't stand here. Maari. - Maari, go. Listen to me. Maari, go. - Mom, I won't go. Listen to us. If you stay, they'll kill you too. No, Dad. I won't go. I won't go. - Obey our words. Somehow, Dad will come, son. - Maari, go. Don't be here. Leave, dear. Go! Where, man? - They're here, Boss. Chase him! Catch him! Hey! How dare you! You didn't listen to me! Sir, please spare my dad. Please! Guys, kill him! Kill him! - Dad! Mom! Mom! Dad! What did he order? I'm asking you. What did he order? Minced parotta and meat. Minced parotta, meat. What happened, dear? Why do you seem upset? I had told you, right? When I was young, in front of me, my mom and dad were killed. He killed them. I've been waiting for a long time to kill him! Now he has come alone. I'll cut open his jugular. What are you saying? Selvi, he has murdered my mother and father. Don't be stupid and get caught by the police. Also, like how you were orphaned when you were a kid, do you want me and my kid to be orphaned too? So? He has come by himself now. Do you expect me to let him go? Brother. No, dear. Please listen. Don't do anything. Give it to me. Damn! You stay. I'll go ask. What do you need, sir? Do you have bottled water? No, sir. Only can water. But it's hygienic. Okay. - What is this? - Selvi. We'll use this rat poison to kill him. Let him go die somewhere else. We won't get caught. Even if the police finds out, we'll say it was an accident. We can say we didn't do it on purpose. Nobody will suspect us. Please agree, Selvi. Selvi, please say yes. Don't be insane! If you want me and my kid to come to the streets do as you wish. You stay. I'll go give it to him. - Hello. - Yeah? Make two more orders of minced parotta and meat. Take-away, sir? Is it take-away? My people are there in the car. You go serve it to them. Okay. Thank God. You didn't do anything. If you had planned to kill him, we would've been trapped. His guys are there in the car, it seems. He has ordered two more minced parotta and meat. What happened? What did you do? God, it's open! Did you mix it? Oh, man! How many times did I tell you? Why did you do it? You know how I struggled without my parents. I have no other choice, Selvi. I told you many times, but it didn't enter your thick skull. I'm scared about what's gonna happen to him. Oh, God. Oh, God. What, dear? Nothing happened? Did you mix it for real? I swear on our Ammu, I mixed it. Oh, God. Maybe this poison is ineffective. No. Many rats have died after consuming it. Maybe, this works only for rats. Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God. Give me some water. Wait. Sir, is there any problem? What? Are you sick or something? Are the minced parottas and meat ready? He's making it, sir. - Make it fast. - Okay. Thank God. Thank God, he's fine. Had something happened to him, his guys wouldn't have spared us. Even if something happens to him, we'll lift him and toss him there. What will you tell their guys? We'll say he fell down while he went there to call someone. Oh, God. Take this. Go serve it to them in the car before they get out. - Okay. - Go. Sir, ask them to be in the car. I'll serve them there. - What? - Let them be there. I'll go serve there. Be in the car, dear. I'll ask them to get it. It's okay. We've been sitting in for too long. Our boy is also getting adamant. We'll come there. - Okay, come. Keep it here. - Come. Oh, God. Come, son. Sit down. - Here it is. - Okay. - Thank God. - Shall we eat? Thank God. We were scared there were henchmen in the car. He's fine. There are no henchmen. Then why are you tensed? What did you do now? Selvi. Since it wasn't sufficient last time, I added some more poison this time. Oh, God! What have you done? Why did you do that? Open your mouth. - Eat. - I don't want it. I thought there were henchmen in the car, Selvi. - So I did that to save ourselves. - Oh, God. What have you done? Eat at least this much. Eat. - No. - Eat at least a little bit. Open your mouth. Eat. Eat! Eat at least a little! Open your mouth. - If you eat, I'll get you chocolates. - Eat, my son. Eat a little bit. Should his wife and kid die too for his mistake? - Eat, dear. - Look here. Open. - Open your mouth! - Sir? Shall I pack the food and give it to you? - Why? - Good boy, right? Police might come at this time. They'll ask for bribes. I'll deal with the police, man. No big deal. Eat at least this much. Here, eat a little bit. Eat at least a little bit, dear. Eat, eat. - Eat, son. - Look here. - Look here. Always adamant. - I don't want it. - Look here. Eat a little. Open. - No. You asked for chocolates, right? You'll get them only if you eat now. What? Go, man! Sir, I'll pack them. What? Police won't disturb you but they'll taunt us. Already, it's very hard to make him eat. You're adding to the misery. Please go. You eat. Open your mouth. - Open your mouth. Eat. - Do something. - Eat. - Look here. - I'll pack them, sir. - What's your problem, man? Kid is eating, right? Go away. Eat, dear. You don't want to eat? I'll buy you toys only if you eat. I'll buy you chocolates. Okay, what else do you need? See there. Open your mouth. Hey! I'll give you one! I'm saying the kid is eating, right? - Don't hit him. - Please don't hit him. - Oh, dear. - Come here. Did you get hurt, dear? No! Don't go! Listen to me! - Hey! - Oh, dear! Oh, God. Hey! Oh, dear. - No! - Please don't hit him. Listen to me! Leave him. - Leave me! - Stop it! Don't do it! Listen to me! Oh, God! No, dear! Oh, dear! Please don't, uncle. Please don't harm my dad, uncle. Sleep, my child - Please don't harm my dad. I'll tuck you in with my love - Please don't harm my dad, uncle. Close your eyes, go to sleep, my child Who are you, man? I'll caress you like a breeze I'm asking you. This moment shall pass, this day too Even if you tend to leave me That which is hiding in my heart My life, my soul, that is you - Uncle, sorry. Please spare my dad. Even when I'm sick from head to toe I'll hold you like a rock This is how I pleaded to you when you killed my parents. Had you spared my parents then for me, I would've lived happily with them. Sleep, my dear cuckoo I'm letting you go only for that child. Sleep, my dear - Please let my dad go, uncle. Please, uncle. - Sleep, the apple of my eye Sleep, you little one Sleep, my dear cuckoo - Sorry. Please forgive me. Sleep, my dear - I made a mistake. Please forgive me. Sorry, uncle. He's fine, dear. Please go to Koyambedu private bus stop. Brother, please go a little faster. Hello. - Madam, the bus is about to leave. I'll reach in five minutes. - Okay, ma'am. I'm on the way. - Please come fast. - Please go a little faster. - Okay, madam. That's my bus. Please stop a little ahead. Juicy! - Can I help you? - Yeah, please. Thanks. Glare. The sun is out after many days, right? It's a sunny day. Yeah. It feels good to see the sun come out after many rainy days. It feels good. Normally, I travel by flight. Due to the cyclone, I had to come by bus. I had planned to fly too. But it got canceled at the last minute. Oh. Nice. So, what do you do? - Modeling. - Modeling? - Yeah - Interesting. But I haven't seen you in any of the ad films. I'm a ramp model. My job is to catwalk. Oh, like that. What do you do? I'm gawking at a beautiful girl now. Sir? "Sir?" Am I your maths teacher or what? Do I look that old? Like a Sugar Daddy! It's a joke. Jokes apart, by the way, I'm Stephen. - Pooja. - Nice meeting you. I'm a financier. I've financed many films. Oh, so you must be a big shot. Are you kidding me? Do big shots travel in this excuse for a bus? Maybe, we both can book a cab together and have fun going to Bangalore. Just kidding. You are staring at me already. You're looking very gorgeous. Why don't you try to become a heroine in the movies? My ex-boyfriend was a movie director. I was supposed to do the lead role in that movie. Interesting. What's the name of that director? He's not that popular. But he has assisted in big movies. Then he started a movie. I was to play the heroine in that. But due to some financial issues, the movie got dropped. If the film had been completed, you would have become a star. Then I wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet you in this bus. Maybe. So what? You can become a heroine in another movie even now. That's not a problem. You still look very pretty. What did you say the director's name was? Michael. Michael Adams. Michael Adams? Director Vinayak's assistant? Yeah. You know him? Hey. If I had known you were the heroine, I wouldn't have stopped that movie. I'm one of the reasons for the movie getting stalled because... I was the financier for that movie. Honestly, if I had known you were the heroine, I'm sure... I wouldn't have dropped it. Sometimes, our decisions might be wrong. We might regret it too. But I don't have any regrets about this one. No regrets. Not at all. What I did was right because that Michael Adams is a psycho. Are you still in touch with him? No, sir. It didn't work out between us. So we parted ways. It was not a big issue at all. After the movie got dropped, there were small fights between us, that's all. Recently, I saw in the news. He got arrested in a murder case, it seems. Yeah, sir. I heard about it too. Thank God we broke up a long time ago. He's a psycho! I had many issues with him too during the filming. He acts like a psycho all the time. That is the reason why I dropped the movie. That psycho Michael Adams, I'll never be able to forget him. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Actually, I was listening to what you two were talking. You're talking about Michael Adams, right? Michael was my student. He used to be a trouble-maker in school. I had warned his parents many a time. I'm speaking from my experience. In my 30 years experience, he's the worst student that I've ever seen. He used to lose his temper and shout often, behaving like a psycho. You are Jennifer ma'am, right? - Yeah. - I'm Matthew, your student. Do you remember me? Hey, Matthew! - Okay. How are you doing? - I'm good, ma'am. What's happening? This is surprising. I'm not able to believe it. We all seem to know Michael. You are Michael's brother, right? - Yeah, ma'am. - You are Michael's own brother? No. Different mothers. Same father. He used to be a lot of trouble when he was young. Be it school, or at home, he used to be big trouble. One day, he made a big ruckus at home and left the house. I didn't know his whereabouts after that. Sir, I've worked for many years with your Michael. He fought with every director. Till date, he has never worked fully for a movie. - He used to behave like a psycho, sir. - Hey. Wait, wait. Who knows Michael here? - I know him. - I know him. - I know him. - We know him well. - I know him. - Oh, God. What happened, sir? Is there any problem? How come everyone in this bus knows about him? How did you all buy your bus tickets? And you? Sir, I'm going to Bangalore to meet a producer. They paid for my ticket. I got an interview offer. So they sent me the ticket. Actually, my son is in Bangalore. He got a free ticket, so he sent it to me. My flight got canceled and I got this bus ticket. It's the same reason in my case. Michael didn't call us about the free ticket. Then... Who would that be? Huh? Sir, it was me who called you all offering free tickets. Who are you, man? Why did you issue free tickets? I'm a travel agent, sir. Michael Adams met me, said he wanted to invite all his friends for his birthday, to Bangalore, and throw a surprise party for them, so he asked me to give these tickets to them without telling the actual reason, and paid me. That's why I lied to all of you\,and made you travel in this bus. Sir, since I had an important job too, I boarded this bus to Bangalore too with you all, and got trapped. Hello, my dear friends. How are you all doing? You'll be happy now. but you won't be, anymore. Wondering why I'm making you all travel together? - Is that him? You've all wronged me. Admit it and say "Sorry". Do you know what's gonna happen if you don't? Please, make way. Please, move away. - What happened, sir? - Please. Make way. Please. Michael, open the door. Michael, please! Don't carry out your plans, please! Sir. Michael, please! Don't carry out your plans, Michael! Please! I can cure you! Michael, please open the door! Please listen to me! - Michael, please listen to me! - Sir, sir. - Open the door, Michael. - Sir, what happened? - Who's that? - I'm a psychologist, sir. I was treating him for two years. He used to say often, he'll take everyone he hates, in a bus, he'll drive it and ram it onto something. Michael, everybody's shouting. Aren't you hearing it? Please open the door. - Michael, please open the door. - Open the door, Michael. Last month, when he said the same thing to me, I dared him to do it. What the hell! Why did you do it, Doctor? It's all my mistake. I was just kidding. Michael, open the door, please! Hey! Hey, Michael! You tell him. He's your brother, right? Do I need to die for all your mistakes? Tell your brother to stop, man. Ask him to stop the bus, man! Hey, guys. Be careful. Hey, get back. What are you trying to do? Everybody be calm. - Please tell everyone, sir. - We'll do something. We'll think of something. Everybody be careful. - The bus is locked. There's no way you can escape. Every minute you delay, you are one step closer to death. Say "Sorry" now! What mistake did we commit? Why should we apologize? You are the psycho! Loving a psycho like you was my biggest mistake. I didn't do anything wrong. It's all you. You created trouble at home and school. Why should I apologize? So you won't ask? No, sir. Be careful! Oh, it's a dream. Oh, my God! The same kitty. Dream or... I'm not gonna help her. Let's see what happens. Looking hot. Like in the dream. - Could you please help me, sir? The same chick. - Thank you. "Thank you" too? Same size, same weight. Mole under the lips. The same sexy legs. Shiny shoes. Oh, God. The dream is getting real. Huh? - She's looking at me. The sun is out after many days, right? - Sunny day. - Yeah. It feels good to see the sun coming out after many rainy days. Usually, I go by flight. But the flight got canceled at the last minute. Got canceled? Shall I ask something? Are you a model? Yeah. How did you know? Have you seen me somewhere? Yeah, in my dream. I don't recollect seeing you but... You wouldn't have. I don't do commercials. I'm a ramp model. So I do only catwalks. What do you do? - Oh, God. Chick is asking the same question! Why are staring at me? I was asking what you do for a living. Actually, I'm a financier. I've financed many movies. - Oh. - Yeah. You must be a big shot then. Have you starred in any films? My ex-boyfriend was a movie director. I was to play the lead in his film. - Oh, God! It got dropped due to financial issues. - The same story as in the dream. May I know the director's name? He's not that popular. But he has assisted in few big movies. Michael. Michael Adams. - Oh my God. Same fellow. Director Vinayak's assistant? Yeah. You know him? Oh, God. Is everything gonna repeat the same way? Is this what they call a bad dream? Oh, God. Bus is running fine. The same people. Please, please, give way! Michael, don't execute your plan! Oh, God. I'll find out if this is a dream or reality. If that door is locked... Oh, my! It is locked! Michael, dude. TV should've been on. TV has no power supply. Maybe this is a dream. - Sir, what happened? - Nothing. The door... What happened, sir? Any problem? No problem. Shall I tell her the truth? You know something? Everybody here knows about Michael. Everybody. He has issues with each and everyone here. It's true. Stop kidding, sir. Please believe me, Pooja. It feels like I've seen all these happen before. Deja vu! Sir, stop kidding. Kidding? The lady sitting in front is Jennifer ma'am. Michael's class teacher. She'll talk about Michael now. At least believe me then. Something bad could happen. Sorry to interrupt. Actually, I was listening to what you two were talking. Michael was my student. See? He was a trouble-maker at school. I had complained to their parents many a time. But... In my 30 years of experience, he's the worst student that I've ever come across. He used to lose his cool and shout at everyone. He used to behave like a psycho, sir. Do you believe me now? The guy sitting up front with his headphones on... He's Michael's brother, Matthew. Yeah! Michael has a brother! He'll speak now. Believe me at least then. You are Jennifer ma'am, right? Yeah. You? I'm Matthew, your student. Remember me? Yeah. Matthew. - You're Michael's brother, right? - Yes, ma'am. Michael Adams is your own brother? No. Different mothers, same father. Michael used to be a lot of trouble when he was young. Be it school, or at home, he created a lot of trouble. He didn't pay heed to our words at all. One day, he ran away from home. I didn't know his whereabouts after that. It's confusing, sir. You still won't believe me, Pooja? I'll tell you one more thing. You'll believe me then. The one sitting behind, he used to work with Michael. Now he'll also say how big a psycho Michael was. Sir, one minute. I've worked with your Michael for many years. He used to fight with all his directors. Till date, he has not worked in any movie fully. He used to behave like a psycho. Huh? Sir, even after knowing about all these, why aren't you doing anything? Is there any problem? Tell me. You know one thing? Michael is the one who's driving this bus! He's gonna ram it somewhere and kill us all. Do you know that? The door is locked. Sir, are you kidding me? So many in the bus. What are you saying? See for yourself. Everbody in this bus will claim to know Michael. Do you wanna see? Who knows Michael here? - I know him. - I know him. - I know him well. - I know him. Do you believe me now? Sir, is there any problem? How come everyone in this bus knows him? Think. How did guys get your bus tickets? Sir, I'm going to meet a producer in Bangalore. They paid for my ticket. I got an interview offer. So they sent me the ticket. Actually, my son is in Bangalore. He got a free ticket, so he sent it to me. My flight got canceled, then I got a call offering me a free ticket. That must be the case for you too. Yeah. The agent who booked the flight tickets, is here. He'll speak now. Will you believe me then? Sir, It's me who called you all offering free tickets. I'm a travel agent. Michael Adams met me, and said he wanted to invite all his friends for his birthday, to Bangalore, and throw a surprise party, so he asked me to give these tickets to them without revealing anything, and he paid me. Did you listen to what he said? It's been a long-time wish for Michael to bring everyone he hates in a bus, ram it and kill them all. Not able to believe it? His psychiatric doctor will talk about it now. Hello, my dear friends. How are you all doing? You must be happy now. - Sir. But not anymore. You must be wondering why I made you all travel in the same bus. You all have wronged me. Admit it and say "Sorry" to me. If you don't apologize, do you know what will happen? Please! Make way! - Please, give way! - What happened? Please. Michael, open the door. Michael, please. Please don't carry out your plan. Please! I can cure you. Please open the door! Sir, what happened? Who's that? I'm a psychologist. I was treating him for two years. He used to say often, he'll take everyone he hates in a bus, he'll drive it and ram it onto something. Michael, everybody's shouting. Aren't you hearing it? Please open the door. - Michael, please open the door. - Open the door, Michael! Last month, when he said the same thing to me, I dared him to do it. What the hell! Why did you do it, Doctor? It's all my mistake. I was just kidding. Michael, open the door, please! - Hey, hey, Michael! - Please, Michael! He's your brother, right? Tell him. Why should I die for all your mistakes? Tell your brother to stop, man. Ask him to stop the bus, man! Please save us! Be careful, guys! Get back. What are you doing, man? Everybody be calm. We'll do something. We'll think of something. Be careful! - The bus is locked. There's no way you can escape. Every minute you delay, you are getting one step closer to death. Say "Sorry" now! Stop it! Please tell the truth! Michael, ask them to tell the truth. Stephen, you say the truth first and apologize. I'll tell, Michael. Michael didn't do anything. I asked him to cast the girl I liked as the lead in his movie. I said I'll finance him only then. Michael didn't accept. That's why I called you a psycho and dropped the movie. I'm sorry, Michael! Please forgive me. Please everybody tell the truth. You told me many times not to include anyone else in the bus other than in your list. But I disregarded it and came in the bus. It's my mistake, Michael. Michael, please don't harm me for that. Please! Please spare me, Michael. I've told the truth. Please spare me, Michael. I have a family. Please spare me, Michael! Hey, Michael! Hey, assistant director, speak the truth. Michael, I spread false rumors about you as I was jealous of you. Please forgive me. Please spare me. Not his mistake. It's all me. I lied. Sorry! You didn't do anything. Actually, I was having an affair with the Principal. I was scared you'll tell everyone about it. So I spread rumors bout you. I lied to your parents too. Please forgive me, Michael! Michael, you did nothing wrong. Mom and I tortured you. We chased you out of the house. It twas not Michael's mistake. Please forgive me, Michael. I'm sorry. Hey, Pooja! Speak! Michael didn't do anything wrong. I fought with him a lot vbecause the movie was dropped. I broke up with him saying he was a psycho. It was not Michael's mistake. Hey, Michael. All of them have spoken the truth, right? Now what's your problem? Why are you doing like this? One person has not told the truth yet. Who's that? Whoever that is, please tell the truth. - Who's that? - Please tell the truth! Living is more important. Please tell the truth! Please tell the truth! Who hasn't? Do you want to die? Please tell the truth. He's a psycho. Look how he's driving! He'll ram it somewhere. The bus is gonna topple. Hey, be careful! Everybody has spoken the truth, Michael! You say, Michael. Who hasn't spoken the truth? Pooja. Tell the truth right now. Or else, all of you will die. Please tell, Pooja! Speak, Pooja! Pooja! Everybody will be saved only if you speak the truth. Speak, Pooja! There are kids. There are families. Come on, Pooja! I'll tell the truth. I'll tell the truth. I was pissed off because I didn't get the lead. So, the lead in his movie, Nisha, I killed her and I framed it to make it look like Michael was the murderer. Sorry! Sorry, Michael! Please forgive me, Michael. Please don't harm us. Please! Please, Michael! Please. It's my mistake. Sorry. Sorry, Michael! What happened, Stephen? - Sir, the suspect has confessed her crime. Have you taped everything? - Her confession has been recorded. Everything under control, sir. Please bring the accused safely. - Sure. I'll take care. - Others are safe? Everyone in the bus is safe. Well done, Stephen. - Thank you, Sir. I'll arrest her.
