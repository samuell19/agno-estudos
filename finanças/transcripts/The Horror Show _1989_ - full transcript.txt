Oh, my God. - Yeah, whoo! - Like father, like son. - I look pretty cool in those glasses. - You got chipmunk cheeks. What? What was that? Cheeks! What a chef. What's he doin', throwin' stuff? Wish I had one of those burgers now. - So cool. - Look at Dad. He's my dad. - Flip those babies! - Not bad. Whoops! What are you laughing at, Scottie? Just kidding, Dad. All right, Mom! Way to go! - Hi, baby. - Look at her. Yeah, well, you're always that way. Get him! Get him. Aww. We're too young to have kids your age. We really are! All right, let's cook those. Those were pretty good, by the way, Dad. Hi, Grandma. Oh, goddamn it, Cosmo. - Where the hell are they? - I told them to wait for us. Hodges and Osborne are blowing it. Jenke will slaughter that girl. You ready? Backup on Lawrence. Squad, get to sector six. Oh, Jesus Christ. Where the fuck is that guy? He really gives me the creeps. He could be anywhere, just waiting on us. Look, I take the diner, you take the plant. Casey. Here. Remember when he got the jump on Marriott and Young? It was broad daylight. They were good cops. They never knew what hit them. I'll put 15 rounds in the prick. He eats and shits same as us, right? Squad, what do you got up there? - Let's go. - Yeah. Oh, shit. Casey, Hodges and Osborne are dead. Watch yourself. Casey? God. Casey? Oh, shit. Luke, Luke... - I did the best I could. - I know, buddy. I know. I-I-I was scared! - Jesus. - I did the best... God! - What? What? - Get Jenke! Get Jenke! I'll nail his fuckin' ass. I'll get him. - That little girl... - What? - She's... - What? Oh, shit. Oh, Casey. Been looking forward to this meeting for three years, cop. - Now, put the gun down. - You're shittin' me, man. Put the gun down, or I gut the little bitch! Hey, this is between you and me. Let the girl go. OK. First you put the gun down. Do it! Good little cop. Right here is where we can show each other what we got. Hey! You were having a nightmare. Oh, my God. I thought you were... Dead? Luke. Luke, Luke! - You're dreaming! - Oh. I don't understand why you want to see Jenke die. I want to see it. Then I know it's over. Then I get back on the street. Have you talked to Hank Miller? Miller thinks that I need more desk time, that I ought to continue my sessions with Dr. Tower. Maybe you should. Don't start with that psychiatry shit. Lucas, you tried to strangle me. Locking Jenke up didn't make the nightmares stop. Maybe knowing that he's dead won't either. Maybe you should see Dr. Tower. I love you, Lucas, and I want you back. Come on, Jenke, it's checkout time. Keep that gun against his head. ...here at Turner State Penitentiary, where Max Jenke, the most feared mass murderer in this nation's history, will be put to death. Max Jenke, whose last request was to be buried with the meat cleaver he used to kill most of his victims, the number of which sources conservatively estimate at more than 110, including seven police officers. Hold it, Joe. Detective McCarthy, you were involved in the Jenke investigation from the beginning. It must be a relief to see him off the streets. Yes. Are you happy that Jenke will be executed? I'm happy to see justice served. You've been on leave since Jenke's apprehension. - Will you be back soon? - Ah, yes. Excuse me. Detective McCarthy how do you feel? Are you glad he'll die? Lucas McCarthy, the man who captured Max Jenke. Glad you could make it, cop. Please, my son, you need to make your peace. May God have mercy on your soul. Any last words, Jenke? Blow it out your ass, pinhead. All right, let's get on with this. Your worst fuckin' nightmare, Lucas. I'm it. All that did was give me a hard-on. - Increase the voltage. - Yeah, increase the voltage, shithead! We got to get out of here! Lucas, I'm going to tear your world apart. I'm coming back to fuck you up. - He's dead. - Oh. - You're sure nobody's been in here? - Professor, I told you, Nobody's been in here since I brought Jenke in. And you haven't heard or seen anything unusual in here? What are you talking about? Power surges or electrical impulses. Listen, professor, the only thing in here are dead bodies. The only power surges or electrical impulses are the ones used to kill the fuck. Well, it may not be that easy, doctor. I've read some of your theories. I think you're full of shit. I don't know how you got the state to let you do this "research", but we sent 50,000 volts of juice through that scum, and he's one dead son of a bitch. Well, I certainly hope so. - Could I have a look now, please? - He's all yours. He looks pretty dead to me. What are you doing? Just satisfying my curiosity. Look, I've got work to do. I don't have time to watch you... take readings. Call me when you're through. - Scott McCarthy? - Yeah. Sign here. "Leave a message at the beep"? Vinnie, where are you? I need... OK, great, Mary Ann. I'll give you a call. OK. Bye-bye. - Who was that? - Mary Ann. Mary Ann look a little like Don Johnson? - Mom! - Who was that at the door, honey? It's OK. It was for me. I don't want anyone over here tonight when we're out. - I'm 18 on Saturday. - Well, you're still my baby. You seen Cosmo? He's probably chasing Scott in the basement. Cosmo? Kitty, kitty. Come on. Kitty? Cosmo. Yummies. Yummies, kitty. Yummies. Come on. Cosmo. Come on. Cosmo? Cosmo. Cosmo? Come on, you little rat. Come on, kitty. Kitty, kitty. Cosmo? Cosmo? Come on, you little rat. Come on. Kitty? Kitty? Useless chunk of metal. Cosmo? I know you're in here. Kitty! Kitty? How'd it feel today, watching him die? Well, the fucker didn't go down easy, I'll say that for him. He had half the juice in the state going through him, and he kept coming. It was unbelievable. You have any guilts about this? I would've paid to see that scum die. - You feel better, then? - Yeah. I can get back to work if you sign those release papers. What's that? On your shin. It's nothing. Just a scratch. - Did you cut yourself? - I don't know. Let me see that. Open your shin. - What the hell for? - I want to see it. - Just a second. - What is that? How'd that happen? I don't know. It's just a thing. You having that dream again? Yeah. Did he throw the cleaver? Yeah. You're Catholic, aren't you? No. I thought for a minute it might be a stigmata. - Stigmata? - Christ's wounds on the cross. Saints are reported to have bled from them. Other people, too. I had an Irish cop last year who shot a young boy. He started bleeding from the palms of his hands. Very strange phenomenon. For Christ's sake. That's the stupidest fucking thing I ever heard. Are you going to sign this thing for me, Doc, or what? Yeah, I guess I might as well get you started. Thank you, Doc. Put some soda water on that, so that stain doesn't set. Yeah. Scott? - What's all this? - It's Nestlé's Quik. Two cases of chocolate, one of strawberry. - How will you pay for this? - It's free. They sent it to me. Why? Because I told them I found rat hair in a carton of their otherwise delicious product. Scott, it's the fourth delivery this month. I have to talk to your father about this. He's not going to be real happy. Mom, it's not that serious. I mean, what's the problem here? I just wish you wouldn't rip off the entire world. Hey. Excuse me, you're on my car. Mr. McCarthy, I need to talk to you. He's coming back. - You were at the execution. - It's Jenke. He's coming back. - What the fuck are you talking about? - It's not over yet... I don't need this. The guy is dead. He was fried. That's the point, you see, he's coming back for you. - You're his link. His hatred... - Are you a fucking nut? No, listen to me. It's very important. He knows what frightens you. He'll eat at you any way he can. He'll go through your family. - Not my family. - It's very important. - Hey! - Please, Mr. McCarthy... Please, you gotta listen! - Mom? - You scared me, honey. Sorry. So where's Daddy taking you? I don't know. I told him it had to be someplace cops don't eat. - Have you seen my pink dress? - Why? I want to see if it still fits. You're not dressing up for company? Mom, I just want to see if the dress fits. For my party. It's probably in the basement. And I still don't want Vinnie coming over. Thanks, Mom. Dammit, Vinnie, you scared me! Oh, sorry. - You weren't due till eight. - I couldn't wait. I was overcome by desire. I gotta get back upstairs. I'll come down when they're gone. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - I promise. - Besides, Vinnie? - Mm-hm? - Honey? - Yeah? It gets better the longer you wait. Well... bigger, anyway. Lucas... I'm going to tear your world apart Jenke! Lucas! This is just the beginning. I'm still here. I nailed your ass good, didn't I? That's right, Lucas. And now it's my turn to watch you die. ♪ I walked over late, then I didn't knock ♪ I really should have knocked but I turned the other way ♪ You know how much I walk ♪ I walk around a lot ♪ I son it out and set it straight ♪ But I can't pick the right time to explain ♪ All the things I have done to our love ♪ All the things that happened because ♪ Of the things I have done to our love... ♪ You left the front door unlocked. - I didn't leave it open. - Somebody brought these in. The news said it took him ten minutes to die. - Mm-hm. - Was it awful? At least it's over now. Vinnie? Where are you going? Bonnie? Bonnie? Bonnie, where are you? I'm watching you. Come on, Bonnie, if you come out, we could have a lot more fun. Yeah, but doesn't it make you horny knowing I'm watching? Huh. That's kinky. - Mm-hm. - That's real kinky. Take your pants down. Baby, you are out there. I love you, Vinnie. Do it for me. - Please? - OK. I think I'm going to leave some of this for you. OK. Then unbutton your shirt. Unbutton my shirt? Is this what you want? Nice. That's right. I love you, Vinnie. Do it for me. - I love you... - Vinnie. Do it for me. Oh, God! No! And besides the Nestle's Quik, the little con man has so much stuff under his bed, I check before I go to the market. Who's he get that from? You or me? Don't answer that. What is this stuff? Two weeks off in Barbados, - then back to active duty. - That's great. We can take those kids that live in our house, if you don't think they'll cramp our style. - Can I come and sit next to you? - Yeah. You know I love you? Vinnie? Vinnie? Vinnie? Vinnie. Vinnie? Vinnie? I know you're here. Come out, come out. Vinnie? Uh-huh. Now I've gotcha! Scott? Bonnie? We're home. Good article? Engrossing? Can't put it down? I don't know. If I was Elvis Presley, I don't think I'd fake my own death and move to Kalamazoo just to eat at a Burger King, do you? - I believe it. - You would. Mm. Yeah? Did I catch you with your pants down? You can't hide from me, cop. Who was that? Wrong number. - Jesus! - Shh! Never sneak up on a man when he's blasting Metallica. You almost gave me a heart attack. Sorry. Help me look for Vinnie. Why? I thought you had a rendezvous in the basement. He's not there. I think he's in the house someplace. Great! If Dad... If Dad finds him, he'll kick his ass. I know. Please? - Shh. - OK. Come on. Shush. He might've just left, you know. No. He likes me too much, And besides, he was too horny. I don't want to hear about this. Vinnie? - Vinnie, this isn't funny. - Jesus, Bonnie! It's Dad! - Why's he going downstairs? - Vinnie. Hey, Lucas... I've seen your daughter. She's pretty. Real pretty. You stay the fuck away from my house and my family. In fact, she looks good enough to eat. You stay away from my daughter, you piece of shit! - Dad found Vinnie. - Hope he doesn't hurt him. Stay the fuck away! - What are you kids doing up? - What's going on here? I thought I heard something in the basement. Bonnie? Oh, I... Vinnie came over while you guys were out. And I guess Dad found him in the basement. - Is he down there? - No, there's nobody in the basement. I heard you talking to somebody. Hey! I didn't talk to anybody, all right? You kids go to bed now. I told you I didn't want Vinnie here. You're grounded. No arguments. Now go to bed, both of you. Luke? Mm, smells great, Mom. Wow, that's some turkey, Mom. Is it Thanksgiving? I thought I'd cook your father's favorite, and we could all have lunch together. - Where is Dad? - He's fixing the furnace. I fixed it. That was some power surge. It shorted out the furnace, but I fixed it. I think that thing's got a mind of its own. - Yeah, killer furnace. - Give me one of those. Why don't you get cleaned up? Lunch is almost ready. All right. Give the music a rest, Scott. What? I can't hear you. The music's too loud. Save it till after lunch. Lose it, Scott! How does he do that? You know that I love you all. Dig in. Mary Ellen didn't have a power surge. Mary Ellen doesn't have 40-year-old wiring. Or two short people incapable of turning off lights. Thank God! - Imagine what her kids would look like? - She's a nice lady. Bonnie, are you going to that concert with Vinnie? I called him, but he didn't return my calls. - He's probably working with his dad. - In the mortuary. No, his parents are gone this weekend. - I'm sure he'll call. - I don't think so. If I know Vinnie, he's probably going out with Bobbie Sue, - or Mimi with the "Look at my big boobies..." - Scott! - He'll call. Don't worry, baby. - Thanks, Dad. - Your grandpa always ate the drumstick. - Wow, Mom, that's some cool trivia. You remember? Don't look now, cop, but your family's dead. “this big! And he did. They were really huge, remember? Just kidding. Lucas. Hey... I just don't like turkey, all right? Oh, like George Bush's wife doesn't look like his mom, right? Come on. Dan Quayle's wife doesn't look like Trigger? Come on. Come on! I was there for one night, a one-night show. This guy that picks me up at the airport, one of these guys, you know, "Halt! Who goes there?" "Bobby Powell. I'm a comic. I came to make people feel good." Funny thing happened today - I saw a lady and a baby hit by a truck. So, I go into this bar, and the bartender says... “'Make me laugh.“ “Can I just get to the airport? I'm a Virgo. "Get to the airport before I get to the airport?" I say, "Martini for me, Bloody Mary for my cleaver." Bartender says, "Sorry, Mary's off today." But not all women were born to be barmaids. Take my wife... and disembowel her, please. My wife said, "I want a vacation. Take me someplace I've never been." I said, "The kitchen or the morgue?" My psychiatrist said, "Jenke, you're a homicidal maniac." I wanted a second opinion. He said, "You're ugly, too." My wife likes to talk after sex. Just last week, she called me from Las Vegas. Lucas, you haven't played Bang The Beaver with the little woman for a long time. She must be one horny little bitch. No! Goddamn it! I gotta know what's happening! I'm... I'm seeing things. I might be doing weird shit. My wife is going to leave me. I don't want to hurt my kids. Am I crazy? Am I? You gotta tell me something that makes sense. I haven't been much help, have I? I can't get Jenke out of my head. If I could find him, I could deal with it. Oh, God. Fucking ass! Don't fuckin' move. You again? Professor of what? My name is Peter Campbell. I'm a scientist. - You're shadowing me. - No. I'm trying to help you. - You think you're going crazy. - I do? Max Jenke is not dead. No? The electrocution, it... it allowed him to move from the material plane. I know it sounds crazy, but... I only want to help you. Help me? You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me. You still here? Take a hike! Look. I understand how you feel, but we could help each other. I'm so close. Look at this place. Look where we are. It's like being inside of Jenke's head. This place is pure evil. I know why I'm here. How come you're here? You know something? You're really starting to piss me off. But how are you going to help me? When I was at Columbia, I was working on a theory of evil as a form of electromagnetic energy, an electricity of evil. That's why I got interested in Jenke. He was the purest form of evil available. Cut the bullshit! Don't you get it? This is it. - What? - This is an electric chair. He was practicing, like taking snake venom to build up his immunity. He can still interact with us. He can do more damage than if he were alive. In order to fight him, we've got to bring him back here, use the same... Hey, relax. Electricity. We've gotta shoot him with enough volts to bring him back here. The longer he stays wherever he is, the stronger he gets. He can already manipulate our reality. Shoot him with juice, bring him back here, then it's simply a matter of blowing the motherfucker away. Keep talking. - Hello. - Hey, babe! Vinnie! Where have you been? All over the place. Sorry I had to leave, but I think I left my wallet on the furnace in your basement. Could you check for me, please? Not unless you tell me why you didn't call earlier. I left you a surprise in the basement. Vinnie? Vinnie? Oh, Jesus. Ahh! Vinnie. No! Vinnie! - Hold it. Open it up. - Hey, stand back. Open it up. Oh, crap. Vinnie. What happened, Hank? Your daughter found Vinnie's body in your basement. He'd been cut in half. - How's Bonnie? - She's had a bad shock. - I wanna talk to her. - Christ, you can't talk to her now. - Why not? - Let's talk about it downtown. You're going to arrest me, Hank? Let's just say that I want to ask you a few more questions. I didn't do this! I didn't do this! Hank, get them out of the house. Will you do that for me? Please, Hank. 3:30am, September 25th. I am preparing what I believe will be an effective means of eliminating Max Jenke. For some time now, I have believed that the same electromagnetic energy that released Jenke can be used to bring him back from whatever godforsaken place he came from. Using his focus, Lucas McCarthy, as the bait, I believe that I can successfully lure Jenke to his destruction. Tonight's experiments will... will verify the validity of my theory. Interesting theory, Professor Campbell... but there are definitely flaws. Oh, my God. What about this Campbell guy? Can he give you an alibi? - No. - Did he kill the kid? I told you, no. Well, what's the connection? What does he have to do with the murder? Lucas! How long have I known you? 15 years? Here in my gut, I know you're good people. But I also gotta tell you, you're in this neck-deep and sinking. That's head-warming - you guys going back a long time, but it doesn't mean shit! What I got ls pieces of Vinnie Capparelli plastered all over your basement! And your own son and daughter heard you and Capparelli... I was not talking to Vinnie. Bullshit! What, the ghost story again? - Are we through yet? - No, we're not through. I can vouch for this man. This is a good cop. Well, I don't know him. You could be Charlie fucking Manson for all I know except for his word, and I don't even know you! - How long you been on the force? - 19 years. Been cited for bravery seven times. - Worked your way up from the street, huh? - That's right. Oh, you're a tough guy, a real hero. What's the point? You knew Vinnie was slipping the stones to your little girl, right? No, that's not right. What - he wasn't fuckin' her or you didn't know? Get the fuck outta my face. No, I'm staying the fuck in your face until you tell me the truth! Now, you came home and you found this kid with his dick in his hand, - and you got pissed off! - Fuck you. He talked back to you. He came at you. He picked up something. What did he do? threaten you? Fuck me? Did he say fuck me? No! Fuck you! Lucas, maybe you thought it was a burglar. A man has a right to protect his home and family. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Thanks, but no thanks. - We're just trying to help. - You wanna help me? Get this sweaty prick off my back. Fine, but you lock one thing up here, OK? I got one murder. I got one suspect. They teach you math at the academy? I'm just an internal affairs officer, OK? You know what it means to be in internal affairs? It means every time some cop goes bad, I get it up the ass from the boys downtown, and I gotta go downtown now! - You're breaking my heart. - Fine. Look, I didn't ask for this fuckin' job, but I got it and I got good at it. I taught myself to learn one thing, one truth, and that is that we're all guilty. The only thing that counts is whether you get caught. Now process this, asshole! You got all the Campbell stuff, Hank? - Yeah. - It's in your court. I'm counting on you. We'll knock this thing. Excuse me. My God, what a nightmare. To be a cop and be arrested by your own kind. Who are you? Oh, excuse me. I'm Michael Jameson. I'm your court-appointed attorney. My card. I can only imagine what would happen if you were sent to prison. Get me to a judge. I want to make bail. Well, under the circumstances, I'm afraid that's going to be impossible. You don't understand, I want to get out of here. I want to go home now. I told you I'd be back. Hello. You sick bastard! - Who are you? What do you want? - I'll have you inside out, little girl. ♪ All the things I have done to our love ♪ All the things ♪ That happened because ♪ Of the things I have done to our love... ♪ No. I got a present for you. No! - Are you OK? - I'm freezing to death. - All right. What about Campbell? - We just brought him in. - What did he say? - In a body bag. Oh... shit!

Campbell was killed with a meat clever like that Vinnie kid. - I'm going home. - Lucas, this IA guy is pushing hard. The judge won't even set bail. This guy's got my family. I can feel it in my bones! What the hell are you talking about? Jenke. Lucas, for Christ's sake, he's dead. You gotta let that rest! I'm going home. You're either with me or you're against me.
