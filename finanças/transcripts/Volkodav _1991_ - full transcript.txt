You go around - go call. To whom? You know to whom. Do not go to the local cops. The foreman here is all captured. Shurik, Shurik. Can you explain? Vika. You do not get me. You are a cop, I myself know. - They ran away. - How do you know that I'm a cop? - Well? Come on, who will review whom? - Do you remember? I took it. Cheap you are a guy, Shurik. He was, and remained. No, Vika, I'm not cheap now. I am now dear. They, Shurik, will find you for the treasury in the next world. So I think. Can go to the cops? I’ll hand over the treasury. I’ll surrender the captain of the special forces. - Maybe they will hire? - Fifty plus progressive? AND? How do you know about the captain? That treasurer slammed you. And I, Vika, know everything about you. How? Do not you take? Rimbaud. You have been dead for three days now. At the foreman in your office of snitches on the choke. So do the legs. Immediately to Moscow. And to me these grandmas - to the eyebrows. Sasha. Stupor. Evgeny Nikolaevich. This morning I flew from Moscow. Moscow believes that the operation failed. Failed miserably. I explain why. First, the treasurer disappeared. The second is the cashier, through whom access to the foreman was possible. Third - Victoria Zhuravleva, by the way, the colonel, your protege, left with the recidivist. Well, this alone is enough to put you on trial. Moscow just removes you. The operation is entrusted to me. Continue, bye, RAM. I ask you - I need complete information on this matter. Clear. Mishchenko. The airport is blocked. Trains under control. Photos sent to all services. We combed all the Sochi beaches. Sanatoriums, hotels. Zhuravleva could not be found anywhere. The Korean waiter showed that Zhuravleva left the restaurant with Volkov without coercion. Perhaps there is a conspiracy. What do you have? Volkov Alexander Ivanovich. He studied with Vika Zhuravleva in one boarding school. Classmates claim that they had love in the tenth grade. Well, the fact that we did not know this is our flaw. He played the ensemble on the guitar. During the fight against rock, he was illegally convicted, allegedly for wrestling with equipment. Clearly, he sat down for nothing. He grabbed a second term. For trying to arrange an escape. Description from the Arkhangelsk colony of high security. Secretive. Strong-willed. For three years, eighteen punishment cells. I understand. Treason in the ranks of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Unfortunately, it has become almost the norm. But. What happened to your protege, captain Zhuravleva, is just, you know, no way. Well, in general. Order for your removal. By the way, I have a written order to use weapons without warning when eliminating criminals . But, what if Vika is there? - We will burn treason with a hot iron. - That's all I wanted to say. Do you hear. They play shells. As then. Moon. Buzz. I haven’t seen the stars for ten years. On the zone, lights out and cranks. And the stars are good. Vikusha, do you hear? Are you sleeping? I am sleeping. Coldly. Warm up? I’ll interrupt somehow. Why are you like that? Beautiful. AND? I tried for you. Full bag of grandmas, but there is nothing to eat. Do you want to eat? Want. What about me? I don’t want you. Shell. Sang and danced. How did you like the holiday? Don't you feel sorry for the treasurer? No. At all? Who would pity me. There was no such pity. Relatives and friends, come to say goodbye to the deceased. - Is everything okay? - Hurry up. Faster. Come on, come on, let's shift. Well. Well well well. To stand. To Wall. You hobble yet, bitch. Oh, Fedor Ivanovich, Fedor Ivanovich. All my life without a queue. And to that light in a strange tomb. Ugly. Why are you here, Sash? What for? I don’t know. Do you remember? Muscovite? Did you have a local manager? An old one. I took him away. And then we rode all night. Do you remember? - Do legs from me. - Oh, I'm sorry. And as quickly as possible. How can I? Let it go. Never. Never. Sasha. Sasha. Sasha. Light the snitch. Who is he? Why do you need it? Who! It will be expensive. Give to give. Agree. Well, show me, turn. Turn it over. Well, Ori. Ori. They will be back. Itself. Ori. I remember you. And I am you. Oh, Shurik, Shurik. What is Shurik? Why didn’t you write? Why? I wrote. No. It later. I'm about the first term. It was shitty, Vika. The first term is this. Yes, and for no reason. Letters were needed. Yours. Letters. Highly. Sorry. Was it bad? Normalek. What to say? Suspended from the ceiling. And three feet. Until they get tired. Learned that a musician. Fingers broke. What for? Cormorant a lot. Eighteen years. Unrecognized genius. He wrote songs in the zone. I waited for you. I know. And the second term? Why? Why? They do not return normal from there. Well? Did you run? As then? Is it possible? As then? Married? Yeah. Three times. I'm free too. So. Arrived. Well, never mind. Senior sergeant Sviridov, your documents. Commander, you know. He took off his suit and forgot the rights of the house. - Such a story. - What suit? Documents? So? Have you agreed? “I'll give you a grandma now.” - What are you? Costume. This is the car of the manager. From the boarding school. Come along, citizen. Come along. I have a full bag of grandmas there. I'll dump you as much as you want. All. Be a human being at least once in your life. Enough. I haven’t seen her for a hundred years. My first love, you understand, well. Well? Do not call. I beg you, very much. All his life at the supply manager, the starter junk. No. No. No. - All. Everything, everything I said. “No, no, why?” - What for? What for? - Well, what is it? What for? Yes. Anything else? Yes. Give this songwriter - let it stall for today. A. What to order? Something from the Beatles. Sergeant Pepper is my girlfriend's favorite drive. It was. Why are you silent? What? Who will review whom? I gave him ten pieces. I would give him everything. - I didn’t. - Bitch. Eat, Shurik. Eat, you have a good appetite. You ask, why did you seize the second term? You do not understand this. Never. Sorry. Kysh, Pyatigorsk eagles. For such things I’ll put it in a corner. This song will sound. For a graduate of the sixth group of a special school - a boarding school named after Krupskaya. Vicki Zhuravleva. Speaks English. Boarding, or what? From the cartoon. Is there a free room to get laid? Why are you buddy? Please, my room is free. - Fast, fast, fast. - Change house and sofa suit? - Zhuravleva? - Yes. It's me. Where are you at? In the Shell. Near Illichivsk boarding school. - Volkov has a treasury. - Very good, Zhuravleva. I'm sending out an outfit, hold on. “Who am I talking to?” - With Major Stupor. What did you decide to hand me over? Stop Did you fuck with me to lay later? Stop How to stop? How? I, I don’t know how? I do not know how. How to stop? Well, run. Run. Together. Sasha. Sasha. Sasha. Take your letters. Photo for the memory of places of first love. Cops. Take it away. All. Not you. There was nothing. Where? To Honolulu. Snitch. Let's go. Brigadier, she was sitting in the back room. And this one said that he had left for Adler by bus. - When? - About forty minutes ago. And I even remembered their number. You have a good memory, big-eyed. Forget about us. And we’ll take this with us. - It may come in handy for someone. - Shurik, cops. Ship her. Chaldean. Just don’t freeze like a treasurer. Let's go to Adler, catch up. Hello fat, it's cold there. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'll get it anyway. Cattle. Do not understand. This is a cop. Do not shoot yet. I need her alive. And you, come on, drive to the fork. Break away from her. Turn around. Go to the primer. Go away. Come on the serpentine. Dear comrades, we are interrupting our broadcast for emergency communications. We are reporting live from the airfield of Adler Airport. Two hours ago, an armed criminal. He grabbed a bus with passengers. And demanded to provide him with a plane. The crew and unimpeded departure to the country. To name which he, so far, refuses. Employees of the Sochi Department of State Security. And a special forces unit. It was decided to provide the plane to the criminal. With the condition of the release of passengers and the bus driver. I give the floor to the chief of operations , Major Stupor. “Please, Comrade Major.” To all posts. Urgently take action. For the detention of a former police captain. Victoria Zhuravleva. - When resisting. - Shoot without warning. Volkov. Once again, I suggest you give up. You are blocked. Resistance is futile.
