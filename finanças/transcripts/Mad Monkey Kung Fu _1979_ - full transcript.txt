Stop pretending, you have so much money Pick up the money. Let's go! I've run my business for five years I'm used to seeing money collectors So they've taken a lot of advantage from you Whaddya know ! Some people are born to pay They pay when they study They pay when they work Why is it like this? These hoodlums ! We sweat night and day and they take from us No way, I'll get the money back Don't go Why? What you get may not be good If you don't get it, you get beaten up I'll fight them to death If you cause more trouble Sooner or later you'll be beaten to death Who cares ! Such stubbornness So it's true What is true? You know kung fu Says who? Those scoundrels say you know kung fu Rubbish It's not rubbish In fact, having followed you this long... I ought to have picked up some Kung Fu But I've learnt nothing Except putting on a monkey show Little Monkey, putting on a monkey show ... is to entertain others to earn a living That's right, otherwise... why the hell would we get beaten up? I only know how to put on a monkey show I don't know Monkey Fist If you want to learn, seek elsewhere I'll go then Boss, the bill Boss ... Coming, coming Wait This is robbery in broad daylight You little bastard again What's your disguise this time ? Damn it ! He who is famous as the Monkey King ... is precisely me Haven't you heard? I haven't, have you? I have heard a lot of other things But haven't heard this Sorry... Little Monkey, don't cause trouble here Boss, his kind should be eliminated such that there will be peace around here Wait, you are not my match Ask your boss to come out Looking for our boss? Correct It depends on how good your kung fu is Cross roads technique Four speeding stallions Breaking horse power Attack from beneath Besiege and destroy Beat him up! Pepper The Monkey King Storms the Heavens It's me! Little Monkey, don't fight! Who'd be responsible for the damages ? Don't fight...! Let me beat him to death! Please stop Or you'll kill him Please have mercy He's just a kid Five more dollars Just let him go Release him I'm not scared of being out-numbered Little Monkey, you're awake Better being unconscious, I'll die easier To die sooner is better than later It's not that I don't want to teach you I'm just afraid... that you'll become like me Learning kung fu will be like you Bullied, insulted and beaten Learning kung fu means a lot of pain I accept pain and hard work I'm afraid you'll drop out in the middle I won't quit even if it kills me What should you do if you want to be my student? Please accept my respects, Teacher! This is not the place for learning kung fu Where should we go then? Follow me to the hills A monkey's fingers are all different Every finger has power Therefore to learn Monkey Fist, you must have... Strong fingers Strong wrists Teacher, to learn like that ... is tiring and inconvenient If you want to grab something You can do it like this If you want to eat food... you can do it like this. What's so difficult? From tomorrow onwards... You must tie your hands on waking And release only when you sleep Teacher The rock must not touch the ground Raise your hands, turn Jump like a monkey Jump Teacher, potato! Put it down Sit down Grab with your hands A monkey's hands are much faster My hands are tied and with the rock I'm naturally slow Then you eat less Again! Little Monkey The roast chicken smells especially good today Yes Do you want to taste it? No No appetite? No, my hands are slower than yours So I'll settle for the potato Why are you so modest tonight? Of course I have to be modest Normally I eat one or two servings I wouldn't think of having a third Then you eat this Teacher, you're right. It tastes real good This is called, 'whoever is fast, gets it' Not bad Little sly fox ! It's late. You're hanging out clothes to dry? No, it's you... not the clothes Me? What for? Your monkey hands are quick enough But your arms are still lacking power Arms' power? What has the rope to do with it? When a monkey sleeps in a tree... he supports his body with arms Right So starting tonight you'll sleep on a rope Sleep on a rope? That's right But that means falling off easily Look at me This can be done! If you're afraid of falling... grasp here You'll get used to it Go on All right then Why did you release your grip? You grasped my arm pit I was itchy so I fell When a monkey climbs branches... frequently tickle his arm pit Why doesn't he fall? That's... Go! Don't be lazy, practise hard! Fingers, wrists, arms; the whole body must have power Teacher, I'm not bad Still far from it What ! Not really so? No way Well, Teacher, you see? Still far from it, right? But of course I'll fall because you pushed me How can you be like a monkey falling that badly So how does a monkey fall? He will do a somersault and land there Get up Teacher, I've learnt for a long time My progress could be regarded as speedy Speedy? My finger, wrist, arm and hip power ; Somersaults and leaping techniques... have all been drilled... am I yet not ready? Still far from it What? If you don't believe it, I can test your skills What's the point ? After all you are not those bastards So you think you can be a match ... for those bastards ? Of course Then according to you... you want to graduate from your training ? That's what I want When do you intend to leave then ? The sooner the better, the more delay... the more dirty money they'll collect I want to leave tonight Okay My pupil ! Yes, Teacher As you are determined to leave ... I cannot retain you But you must remember There'll be the best among the best Teacher, please accept my respects First bow Second bow Third bow Take care of yourself Wait Teacher, you're changing your mind again For your trip this time... I don't have anything special to give you Teacher, are you giving me this hat? Don't underestimate this hat Once you've worn it, you wouldn't want to take it off That's great. Thank you , Teacher Ah Tien, this kid has survived a few beatings And has become a kindergarten teacher You bunch of bastards... Bastards You teach those kids to scold us Aren't you afraid to die? Well, I do wish to die But the Yama doesn't want me That's easy. We'll make sure you go to him Wait ! Are you both gutless? Letting useless hoodlums to attack first? But of course, if not... how else will they earn their keep ? That's a point Say no more. Eat it Wait, so much confusion ! The spectators can't see clearly Let's fight one on one Okay, Ah De, you go Also, this is not suitable for children Kids should not watch Don't watch, go on... Not bad It's hard to win with a single tile A pair is better Bump... Bump again Very itchy Which side is it? This side is real I'll give you something good Very juicy So sour A pair of two bamboos Not a bad set of tiles A small hand again Better. Ask for three tiles Red, Green and White Dragon, you all go Red, Green and White Dragon, One bamboo East, south One circle, One and Nine Wan You're so aggressive Wanna go for a Full House, huh? Nine bamboos Wait, once Nine circles appears ... you will have Full House, right? Too much mah jong strains the mind Practise Monkey Fist Practise finger power Also... It's your turn It's our turn Who goes first? You, of course I have to watch the money I... Anyone will do That's outdated. Audience doesn't like it You see, now the audience likes it Where's my hat? Are you stealing my smoke? His cough is alienating everybody It's me A kick here, a kick there Be considerate, don't smoke Jumping on top This is your filter Not a bad taste Where's my hat? Here Don't touch it Drunken snake! Of course, Drunken Snake from the Cave Lazy Monkey Stretch What's up? Don't fool around! My shoulder is dislocated How much money have you collected today? It's not my fault, it's him... It's him Not much Return all the money that you've collected Will you do it? Yes, yes, quickly... Bring me to your boss Do we have to? Are you going or not? Yes, going... Go then! See you...thank you for coming What are you all doing, standing here?

Get up Now you're really like a tortoise Help quickly! It's me Turn again! Not bad. Stand back So you have some real kung fu Choi, he really knows my stuff You say I am putting on a monkey show? This is real Monkey Fist It is not real Monkey Fist You merely act like a monkey, that's all What? Who is he? My big brother So you're not the big boss I'm the second in charge So that makes him the boss So you've just been pretending I'm temporarily the boss when big brother is absent For all the time you've been around... You don't even know such kung fu The Monkey Fist... I know that Then who is your teacher? Are you interrogating me? A man possessing kung fu skills will not tell Yes...! Bring two ladies to the VlP room Yes... Ah Choi, prepare to serve the meal ! Right away, boss Serve the meal? Do you know what pleases my palate? I know A feast of highest quality, right? You know Monkey Fist too We can have a fight Sister, let's go down Ladies Mr Duan's kung fu is still powerful Sister, does his somersault remind you of... My brother ?

I don't know Right, Ah Choi Crack his skull slowly, blow by blow Yes Oh, no... Grab him, don't let him get away Are you blind? The hat given by Teacher is still in the brothel Must be Uncle Chan's student You ! Horny and coward Me, afraid? If it wasn't for you, could he have escaped? Do you think I pulled my skirts deliberately ... for others to see? You like anyone who is versed in Monkey Fist What ? It was you who asked me to arrange the trap Now you... So you are accusing me now Don't forget you were rewarded handsomely Yes, you gave me this brothel But you also promised me Once you've got what you wanted... You'll give me Tsuei Hung as the top prostitute However you've procrastinated many years Now what is happening? Why are you coming back? To get back the hat Teacher gave me What's his name? Uncle Chan He's really my brother My Teacher is your brother? Yes, I just heard Some years ago My brother fell into Duan's trap To save my brother... I became Duan's mistress Duan Shiangyuan! You...

When you left you were full of pride Why pull a long face now? Yes... Headache? No Mourning on someone's behalf? No Then someone must have hit you on the head Yes, Teacher You must have thought your kung fu was good How would you have a swollen head ? No, Teacher. I started off smoothly And used finger, wrist and hip power And drove them from the main street to the brothel Beating those scoundrels such that... they were all over the place But unexpectedly there came a big boss ... who said mine was not the Monkey Fist But a mere semblance of monkey movements Shouldn't I be angry? I used my somersault skills But little realizing... Lost the fight Yes Your head has been injured Why haven't you used the hat I gave you... to cover your shameful wound? Hat? Teacher, I saw your sister My sister? Yes Where? In the brothel How come she's in... Teacher, she's not a prostitute She's that boss's... Is the boss's surname Duan? That's the bastard Teacher, your sister said... What did she say? That you fell into the bastard's trap How could I... In order to save me... Your sister helped me fight those crooks But we couldn't beat him... Teacher, where are you going? To find my sister You can't go Why? That Duan fellow is conniving And besides, your hands... My hands are like this because of him Teacher, don't worry All things considered, she's his wife I don't think he'll do her harm. Besides... you can't use the Monkey Fist effectively on him; Which renders it totally useless Little Monkey, you should know that your Kung Fu... ...is still a long way off So what's to be done? Continue to practise diligently You must attain the skill to pursue and attack Four styles of the palm Attack Again Teacher Teacher Business has been good recently Miss, you are really... beautiful !

Attack ... ! Stay calm... don't be afraid ... Don't be afraid... attack ... My hands ... We better leave ! Let's go ! Old Duan, has my Monkey Fist improved?

The moral of the story is That as a martial arts practitioner... you shouldn't be attracted by sex Neither should indulge in immoral things Practise more Kung Fu, and keep good health Understand? Is it painful? This is called do unto others what they do unto you Teacher, isn't that correct? Also, I so wish to avenge your sister ! Little Monkey!
