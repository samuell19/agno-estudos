(dramatic music) (child giggling softly) (rain pattering) (soft music) (thunder cracking) (car horn blares) (tires screech) (cars crash) (solemn music) (birds chirping) - We're all here for ya. - You bet, any time, any place. And hey, if you need a pinch hitter in the mom department you can always borrow one of mine. Hey. - Smooth, Bridges. - [Bridges] What'd I say? - [Friend] Well, go talk about sports or something. - I'm not so sure. Figure it out on Monday or something. - [Friend] So if you wanna ditch school for a few days I'll cover your classes. - [Friend] And my dad said we can hang at the cabin if you wanna get away. - Um, I'll just, uh, figure it out, you know? - [Friend] Man, your dad looks a wreck. (smoke alarm blares) (spirit whispers) (Jesse sniffs) - I don't smell anything. Watch out, honey, watch out. (grunts) (smoke alarm continues in distance) (sniffs) - Ah. - What is goin' on here? Ow, watch out. Gotta be a short of some kind. Ah, geez. (smoke alarm continues in distance) Hey, honey, will you give me some room here, please? (mysterious music) Come on honey, come on. Ah, geez. (smoke alarm continues in distance) (dog barks in distance) Oh, God. - It's Mom. - Kelly. Listen. I know how hard this has been on you. It's been really hard on me, too. - It wasn't supposed to be her. It wasn't her time. It's because of me. - What? No. No, now you listen to me, look at me. Look at me, listen to me. You gotta believe this, okay? This is not your fault. - [Kelly] It's a sign. (birds chirping) - [Onlooker] Hey, check this out. Right over there. (church bell tolling) - [Jacob] Hey! - [Kelly] Mom was the one with the thing for New Orleans. (car horn blares) This house isn't you. - Yeah, I know, sweetheart, I know. I've always been a steel angle, you know, glass everywhere kinda guy, but when I saw that house, somethin' about it, you know, it just drew me. Couldn't get it outta my head. You are gonna love New Orleans. I'm guaranteeing you that. Now you may have to talk a little different, you know what I'm sayin'? - Sure. I don't mind being dragged along on your career change crisis thing. - Yeah, you were part of the package, sweetie. - 2,000 miles won't change a thing. - It's got to, Kel. (soft music) (boys chattering) - [Boy] Oh! - [Boy] Smooth move, retard. - [Boy] Right in the spook hole. - [Boy] Man. - You go get it. - [Boy] Mm-mm. - I ain't gettin' it. (gate squeaks) Forget it, we'll all go. - Oh, hey look, there's the ball. - Let me, I see it, I'm gonna get it. - Hey! (boy gasps) You kids know know what happens to kids who trespass here? Huh? No? You heard of Hannibal Lechter? Lizzie Borden? Rasputin? - We just want our ball. - Just want your ball? Get outta here. - Get outta here! - Go faster! - Go, go, go! - Move it! Don't stop, run! - Oh! (spirit giggling) (objects clanking) (mysterious music) (rain pattering) (thunder cracking) (Kelly and Marjorie laughing) - How about a BMW convertible? - Well we might be able to afford one that's 10 to 15 years old. - Mom. - What? 10 to 15 years is a classic. - 10 to 15 years old is a pile of junk. How about a Mustang convertible? - Now you're gettin' warmer. Is the weather man ever right? - No. (upbeat music) - Oh, good one. (both laugh) Turn it up. (solemn music) (rain pattering) (siren wailing in distance) (TV chattering indistinctly) (soft music) (Jacob grunting) - Come on, take me. (mysterious music) (objects crashing) (glass shattering) (grunting) (eerie music) (objects crashing) (TV chattering indistinctly) (breathing heavily) (mysterious music) (birds chirping) - Well, so much for truth in advertising. - I like it. (gate squeaks) (door creaks) Nice. - [Jesse] Looks like somebody's been here before us. - [Kelly] It's a mess up here, too. - [Jesse] They hit every room. (mysterious music) - [Kelly] My room's fine. Kelly, get down here! I'm gonna call the police. (soft music) (police radio chattering) But I can't really tell if anything's been taken. Obviously I'm not gonna know that till I get this place-- - Yeah. - Unpacked and cleaned up. - You let us know if your find otherwise. - Yeah. - You know, I always wondered what this place was like inside. - Oh yeah, why is that? - Oh, you know how it is when a house is empty too long. Huh. I have a pretty good idea who your, uh, uninvited guest was, but you might wanna change your locks, beef up security. - Yes, yes, I'm gonna do that immediately. - [Officer] It's a hell of a welcome to town. - [Jesse] Yeah really. All right, well, thanks for comin' over so quick. - [Officer] Ah, it's no problem. No problem at all, take care. - All right. - We'll be in touch. (police radio chattering) - Nice. (door knocking) - [Officer] Mrs. Barton, is your son at home? - [Mrs. Barton] Cole, get down here, it's the cops, again! (birds chirping) - Hey, how you doin'? How are the kiddies? Hey, listen, I'm gonna check in at the university, see how many future Supreme Court Justices have signed up for my course. You wanna come with me? Maybe we'll do a little sightseeing on the way back home? - No, I think I'll just stay here and get these guys settled. The trip was hard on them. - All right. Hey, maybe we can catch a little bite later. Go to one of these local restaurants, get you hooked on some Louisiana oysters. - Sure. - Okay. I'll see you later. - Okay. Keeping her pictures in a box won't keep her away. She's here. - Hey, that's it, okay? I don't wanna hear it anymore. I'm sick and tired of this hocus pocus voodoo garbage. I don't wanna hear it. - Well, then we probably shouldn't have moved to New Orleans, I hear voodoo is very in here. And Mom is here. - Kelly, just stop it. (sighs) God. (soft music) You would have handled this so much better than I am. (mysterious music) (soft music) (spirit whispering) (eerie music) (whooshing) (rain pattering) (upbeat music) - Come on. (Kelly laughing) Come on. Stop, I can't concentrate. Kel. I can't concentrate, stop it. - Mom! (car horn blares) (Marjorie screams) (tires screeching) (cars crash) (spirit crying) (door creaks) (spirit whispering) (spirit laughs) (thunder cracks) (rain pattering) - Kelly, help me. (birds chirping) - Hey. Hey, listen, I'm sorry I blew up at you like I did last night. I mean, I, you know I get my moods too, and uh, you got stuck in the middle of that one. I'm makin' some eggs, you want some? - You lose somethin' in my yard? - What are you talkin' about? Just out here sneakin' a smoke. - Yeah? - [Cole] Yeah. - You forget your cigarettes? - Guess I'm out. - You can have one of mine. (Cole coughs) - You smoke often? - Yeah, it just isn't my brand. (coughs) - You're Cole. Kelly. So why did the cops assume the break-in was you? - Can't imagine. I didn't do your house. - Well... You know, you've been watching me. I don't like it. - It's started hasn't it? - What do you mean? (door creaks) - [Mrs. Barton] Cole! You wanted toast, you got toast! Now get in here and eat it! (door creaks shut) Hey! What do you mean, what started? - You know. (soft music) - [Teacher] Chromium was discovered by French Chemist Louis Nicholas Vokeilas in 1797, and named from the Greek word chroma meaning color. This was an appropriate choice because all of the compounds of chromium are colored. The pure metal, however, has a silver-white color. Although brittle, it is quite hard. Chromium metal is usually extracted from chromite, an oxide of chromium. But as it's most important (indistinct), chromium oxide, now write this down, C-R-- (students chattering) - [Student] Yo, DJ, wait up! (girls giggling) (Kelly laughing) - Like he's got a chance. - Have you seen his butt? - She's just into anything with a hard pocket. (girls laughing) - What is so funny? - Nothing. - Guys? Kel, those wouldn't be the cookies that I baked for my open house, would they? - [Kelly] No. - You are so dead. - [Friend] Your mom is too cool. - Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. You're Kelly O'Conner? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Melissa Grayson, your guidance counselor. Can I join you? - Sure. - These are from a secret admirer, although I suspect they're really from the football coach. He lives next to this particular bakery. So, how is your first day going? - Okay. - Pretty different from California, huh? But you've been here before. - No. - [Miss Grayson] Oh, I thought your mother was from New Orleans. - No, why would you think that? - She was a Prejon. That's a very distinguished name in this city. - My mother was born in California. - [Miss Grayson] My mistake. This is a good school, Kelly, and I want to help you adjust. To make the most out of what we have to offer. - I've already been in therapy, Miss Grayson. - Do you have any special interests? - I like animals. They accept you for what you are. Excuse me, but I have to get to class. - Kelly. My door is always open. Come talk with me. (dramatic music) (wind whooshing) (birds chirping) (spirit whispering) (objects crashing) (Jacob breathing heavily) (motorcycle buzzing) - Hey! (door creaks) - Cole! I need you in here now! (door creaks shut) (door creaks) (phone rings) (Kelly screams) (answering machine clicks) - [Jesse] Hi, this is the O'Conner residence. Leave a message, we'll call you back. (answering machine beeps) Hey, Kel, it's Dad, I have a Departmental hors d'oeuvre thing that I've gotta do at six o'clock, so can you manage for yourself tonight? Make it up to you over the weekend. I'll see you around nine. - Perfect. (sighs) Guess I better clean this up. (birds chirping) What's up? (Cole sneezes) - Oh, great, animals, huh? What are you, some kind of Dr. Doolittle? - [Kelly] It's just something I do. - Why? (sneezes) - 'Cause I'm raising my own army to eliminate useless teenage males from the face of the planet. - Oh yeah, you're weird. - What did you mean before, what's started? - You're so smart. Figure it out yourself. - The truth is no one wanted them. They were gonna kill them. So I brought them home. - Yeah, the world sucks sometimes. (sneezes) (coughs) - Okay, you guys. These eyes are opening in 10 seconds whether you like it or not. - Don't get your panties in a bunch, Mom. - I beg your pardon, young lady. What did you say? - Yeah, keep those eyes closed. Are you ready for this? Are you really ready? - I'm ready. (all laughing) (Marjorie gasps) - Happy Birthday! - Oh, what is that? Oh, look at you, you are so cute. Oh look at the puppy. - Isn't he cute? (Marjorie sneezes) - Yes. (Marjorie sneezes) - Oh boy. - Oh, you can't be allergic to him. - No I'm not, I'm not. It's just a little (sniffs) fur in my nose. - You won't last a week, Mom. Look at you, everybody's gonna think Dad beats you. (Marjorie sneezes) - I'm not allergic. (Marjorie sneezes) Oh. - Listen, honey, maybe we should take this little puppy back before you get too attached to it, and we'll get you somethin' else for your birthday, huh? (Marjorie sneezes) Oh God. Come on, I'm serious, this is... - [Marjorie] Oh. (sneezes) - I tickle her, you grab the pup. - No, no, no, Jesse. Kelly, don't let him take the puppy. Oh, you little puppy. (both laughing) Don't let her take it, please, Kelly. (Marjorie sneezes) (solemn music) (crickets chirping) (wind whooshing) (spirit whispering) (eerie music) - [Spirit] Kelly. (Kelly gasps) - [Kelly] Mom? (mysterious music) (spirit whispering) (spirit crying) (door creaks) (door slams) (soft music) (wind whooshing) (gun fires) - Please! - I want to. - Are you crazy? Oh. (Kelly screams) (Kelly grunts) (Kelly screams) - [Kelly] No. (screams) Mom? (soft music) Mom? (mysterious music) (spirit crying) (gasping for air) (coughs) (phone rings) (phone ringing) - Hello? (door creaks) Hello? Hello? (soft music) (phone beeps) (sighs) (school bell rings) (students chattering) (dramatic piano music) - That was amazing. - You're sneaky. - [Kelly] Really? You're pretty good on that. - I do okay. Considering I don't have a piano at home to practice on. - Your parents not into music? - Not into anything that's not 100 proof. - Oh. So, what do you call that? - [Cole] I haven't decided. - You wrote it? - Yeah. What do you think about, uh, "Football Superturds At the Proctologist" as the title? - I think you need a lyricist. - [Mr. Pickett] Mr. Barton, cuttin' classes again. - Looks like it. - [Mr. Pickett] You know that this area's off limits. - What am I gonna do? Break the piano? - You're lucky the janitor called me instead of the cops. - So call the cops. - Let's go, Mr. Barton. I'll see ya in detention hall first thing tomorrow mornin'. - [Kelly] He was just playin' the piano. - Are you a student here? - Unfortunately. - [Mr. Pickett] And where are you supposed to be right now? - Oh, I'm done for the day, but- - She's new. She doesn't realize you're the Vice Principal, Mr. Pickett. - I don't- - We'll just be leaving now. - Why did you drag me outta there? - Look, if I wanna get in trouble, that's my deal. I don't need someone else makin' trouble for me. - Sorry. So why did you call my house last night? - I saw the light. Figured you were in trouble. I used to think I was imagining it all, you know. But there is definitely somethin' in your house. Or someone. Your house is the whole reason I'm into the paranormal. You have no idea the kind of unexplained stuff that's out there, I mean, I got this friend, she's a spiritualist. She told me you were coming. Described you right down to that little freckle on your cheek. How weird is that? - Very. - Damn straight. - Cole, I know who the ghost is. - What? - It's my mom. She died last year. - I'm sorry. I've watched 11 families move in and out of that house. Your house has been a spook meca ions before your mom died. (Kelly sighs) - What do you know? - [Cole] I know it can't be your mom in there. Hey look, I'm sorry. (door creaks) - Ah. Are you aware of what time it is? - You're finishing furniture? - Yep. All those years being a corporate attorney, I didn't have much time for anything else. - No, you always had time for me and Mom. - Thanks. I did try. - I'm gonna go feed the animals. - Don't worry. I already fed them. You know, those guys are a big responsibility. You know, they depend on you to take care of 'em, on schedule. - Yeah, they depend on me, not you. So I'll take care of them. (soft music on TV) (TV chattering) (clock ticking) (birds chirping) (alarm rings) (footsteps clacking) - It hurts me to see you not living up to your potential, Mr. Barton. You've got all the potential in the world to do whatever you- Miss O'Conner, you weren't included in my summons. (Cole sighs) - If Cole was breaking the rules, so was I. - Then you can join Mr. Barton in detention hall, next six Saturdays, eight a.m. till noon. - That isn't a fair punishment. - Miss O'Conner, you've jumped into the middle of something without knowing all the facts. Now that kind of rash behavior is going to get you in trouble. - I'm already in serious trouble. (soft music) - [Guide] This is the site of one of the most notorious murders of the 1920s. You see that door? It was right up there. The life of a beautiful young woman was snuffed out by her lover in a fit of jealous rage. (phone rings) Her ghost is often seen walking along the balcony. (phone rings) - [Jesse] Hello? - [Miss Grayson] Mr. O'Conner? - [Jesse] That's me. - [Miss Grayson] This is Melissa Grayson, I'm Kelly's guidance counselor. - [Jesse] Hi. - [Miss Grayson] Could we meet somewhere? - [Jesse] Uh, sure. Where? - [Miss Grayson] Jackson Square, this afternoon. - Bon jour. - Bon jour. (mysterious music) - Can I help you? The spirits are with us. Sit. Did you want cards, palms, rune stones, or crystals? - I don't know. - Do you have a particular question? - My house if sort of haunted. - Your question? - Is it my mother? - Perhaps I could help you reach your spirit. I could arrange a seance if you have- - [Kelly] I don't think so. (spirit whispers) - Uh, no, never mind. Um, just go, just go. (ominous music) Wait. You must leave your house. Or the spirit will kill you. It must, to ease its own suffering. - Would you please listen to me for one second. I am not accusing your son of anything. I just wanna talk to him, that's all. But you know what? Never mind, because she's walking in the door right now. (phone beeps) You better have a very good excuse for why you completely missed school today, and how you've already managed to get detention. - Oh, you wouldn't understand. - Try me. Kelly. - It's not big deal, okay? - Oh, it's no big deal. Well, what about these? No big deal? - What, you used to smoke. - I am so afraid for you. I don't want you to have anything to do with that kid next door. And I'm gonna be calling the school hourly to check to make sure that you're there. - Why don't you just put an electronic tracker on me? - Hey, you wanna be treated like an adult, then you gotta stop acting like a child! I'm the obstacle, I can't do anything. There's nothing I can do to get through. - I see what you're saying. She's lonely, I mean, she wants friends. She wants to fit in, I can feel it, but she's just distanced herself from everybody. - Right, (clears throat) well- - Well, tell me about Marjorie. She must have been special. - She was very special, she was very special. I met her the first day at college orientation. I fell in love with her right away, head over heels. It was a lot of fun, we had a lot of fun. And then Kelly came along, and just completed both of our lives. These are excellent, I love these. - I like 'em. - Love 'em. - Well, let me ask you somethin'. - What? - How do you think you're handling it? I mean, are you doing okay since she died? - To tell you the truth, I don't know, I've been so worried about Kelly I haven't spent much time even focusing on my own loss. - Well, that makes sense. - But this time? This time I have really messed the whole thing up badly because Kelly blames herself for her mother's death. - You're right, she blames herself for Marjorie's death, but think about that. What that means is she also feels like she's ruined your life. So she's not angry at you. She's mad at herself. - My daughter hates me. - No, she doesn't hate you. - No, believe me. No, there's nothin' I can do to fix it. - [Miss Grayson] Kelly lost her mother at a time when girls need their mothers the most. She'll come around. And when she is ready to talk, you just need to be ready to listen. (soft music) (birds chirping) (clock ticking) (ominous music) (spirit breathing) (floor creaking) (spirit crying) (suspenseful music) (floor creaking) - Mom? (spirit crying) (ominous music) Who are you? - Hey, Kelly. (Kelly screams) Kelly, what happened? Kelly! Kelly! - Cole. (rock clinking) Cole. (window creaks) - Kelly? - I need you help. - I like it here, ya know? Away from everybody. - I like it here, too, just not at night. - Hey, they're just dead people. What can they do? I don't know, everybody needs a getaway place, right? - Getaway to dreamaway. - [Cole] What? - It's something my mom used to say. The ghost isn't my mom. - Well, why, why, so you're, are you saying you saw the ghost? - She's this beautiful young woman. She doesn't look at all like I thought a ghost would look. She looks so real. - Holy crap, you saw the ghost. - [Kelly] Why is this ghost haunting me? - Look, this is not about you, okay? Yes, since you guys got here the paranormal activity has accelerated, but that doesn't- - Then it is about us. - Okay, look. All I know is this is not a friendly spirit, okay? Somethin' has her all ticked off. - She didn't look so evil to me. Cole? Cole? (Cole shouts) You jerk-hole! - Kelly, you shoulda seen it. This dead guy, I swear, hey, uh... Kelly, I'm kidding, Kelly. (crickets chirping) Kelly. Come on. Come on, Kelly. - You scared me. - Oh, awe I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (tires screeching) - Get in the car. Both of you. - Nice car. - It's got an anti-theft system. - [Cole] See you. - Oh, no you won't. Where is that kid's parents? - They're probably sleeping it off if they're not still out gassing up. - I told you that I didn't want you hanging around with him. - There's nothing wrong with Cole. - That is not the point. - You don't know everything. - I know, but I'm still in charge. - Goodie. - Why did you tear outta here like that? I can't help you if you don't talk to me. - You can't help me because you won't listen. - All right, hold it, hold it. We are not done here. There's a school in Colorado that specializes in working with teenagers who've lost someone. Maybe they can reach you. - You can't do that. - I don't wanna do it. But you don't leave me very much choice. I gotta try somethin' to get you back. - I hate you. - I know. I know you do. I have to go to work. (soft music) I expect you to be here when I get home. (door slams) (Kelly crying) (pills clattering) (floor creaking) (spirit giggles) (floor creaking) (ominous music) (spirit giggles) (spirit giggles) (floor creaking) - Virginia. Jacob Hardesty. Angela. (Angela giggles) (whooshing) (mysterious music) (Angela giggles) (thunder cracks) - Hey, do you wanna go over to Nanna's and swim in the pool? - Yes. - You do? Come on. You look beautiful today. Come on, my sweet Angela. You ready to go? Come on. Watch your step. That's my sweet girl. (thunder cracks) (door creaks) (birds chirping) (thunder cracks) (spirit whooshing) (group chattering) (rain pattering) (light music) (child giggling) (children chattering playfully) - [Angela] Mommy, Mommy. (anxious music) (thunder cracks) (ominous music) (group shouting) (thunder cracks) - No! (thunder cracks) (door creaks) (door bangs) (ominous music) (spirits chattering) - No, it's not your fault! (speaking indistinctly) (whooshing) (gun fires) (body thudding) (whooshing) - Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, it's just me. - Did you see it? - See what? - Her name is Virginia Hardesty, and she had a daughter, Angela, who drowned. Her husband, Jacob, had this gun, I didn't really see what happened, but she was lying on the floor. - Whoa, hey, check this out. It's blood. - Cole I have to help her. I just don't know what I can do. - Well, what do you think she wants, revenge? - I don't know. I have to try something. (birds chirping) - Come on. Here. - 1958. Angela Hardesty. She was only four years old. - Geez, they died the same year. - There's no Jacob. Maybe he's still alive. - [Cole] I can't believe this stuff wasn't online. - Here. Here it is. Jacob was arrested and charged with Virginia's murder. - And he was acquitted. - Jacob Hardesty had to close his architectural office due to lack of business. - [Cole] He still got away with murder. - He was acquitted. - Yeah, then why is Virginia still here? - Because him and Virginia need to find each other- - Nah, I'm still goin' with revenge. (soft music) Guess the only way to know is to find Jacob. (computer keys clicking) Hey. The man still breathes. (motorcycle buzzing) (door knocking) (door creaks) - [Kelly] Mr. Hardesty? He's not here. - [Cole] Oh yeah, this is cool. Sightseeing in a killer's lair. - [Kelly] Wow, these are really good. - Don't touch those. You're trespassing. - Mr. Hardesty? - [Jacob] Maybe. - I live at 4314 Elmwood. You used to live there, right? - What do you want here? - Your wife, Virginia? - Go away. - Mr. Hardesty you have to come with us. She's desperate. She doesn't understand what happened, but I'm with her all the time every minute of every day, of every night. - Virginia's been dead for 40 years. - Look, I know they accused you of killing her, but you were acquitted, so I'm willing to believe that whatever happened wasn't your fault. - I killed her. You got that? (solemn music) And I'm not going back to that house. Now get out. Get out! (chair creaks) (gasps) (motorcycle buzzing) (dramatic music) - Cole! - What? - We have to go back. - Why? - He didn't question that Virginia was ghost, he already knew. - I'm not goin' back. That guy is bad news. - He had heart pills on his nightstand, he's sick. (objects crashing) - Oh yeah, she's ticked. (ominous music) (objects crashing) - [Kelly] Oh my God. Oh my God. (objects crashing) (wind whooshing) (Kelly screams) (electricity zapping) (wind whooshing) (objects crashing) (spirits chattering) (baby crying) (mysterious music) - [Cole] Oh wow. - That's Virginia. I think she's in the nursery. (spirits wailing) I'm sorry. He just wouldn't come with us. (wind howls) (objects crashing) (Kelly screams) Cole! (screams) Stop! Stop! - [Cole] Kelly, no! Kelly! Kelly! (Kelly screams) (Cole shouts) - Cole! Cole! Hold on. Hold on. I got you. (both grunting) Oh my God, he's gonna freak. He's never gonna believe any of this. You have to go. - You gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Go, go. (soft music) - [Jesse] Kelly! (door squeaks) Kelly? Kel. Kel! Kel, what happened? You all right? - Yeah. - What happened? - It was like this when I came home. - That damn kid. - It wasn't Cole. - Oh no? It wasn't Cole, then who the hell destroyed my house? - It was a ghost. Her name is Virginia. - A ghost. You know, you never ever used to lie to me. - I'm not lying, okay? I saw her and she was standing right in front me. Cole saw her too. - Cole saw her too. So Cole was in this house, and I told you that I didn't want you hanging around with Cole anymore, didn't I? Get up to your room. Go on, get up there until I figure out what I'm gonna do with you. - You never believe me. All you wanna do is get rid of me. - You're all I've got left. - Yeah, thanks to me. - Oh my God. Is that you really think? We'll talk about it in the morning, all right? (soft music) (whooshing) (door creaks) - Shh. Shh. I love you. (rocking chair creaking) We're gonna be fine. We're gonna be fine. We're gonna be fine. We're gonna be fine. It's okay. (dramatic music) Virginia! No, Virginia! (Virginia gasps) (gun clatters) What are you doing? (thuds) (grunts) No! (gun fires) (soft music) - He was lying. (Jesse grunts) - Marjorie. What? (car starting) That's impossible. (engine roars) (tires squeal) Kelly! (speaking indistinctly) (mysterious music) (door knocking) Where's my daughter? - Uh, I'm guessing not home? - All right, you listen to me, you little wise-guy-wanna-be. My daughter took my car and I'm gonna bet that you know where she went. - We can take my bike. - Hey, do you know where Mr. Hardesty is? - Maybe, it'll cost ya. - I don't have any money, I can maybe get you some later. - Ambulance came by about an hour ago and took him off. - Where? - Either the Parish Hospital or the Parish Morgue. I can't say which! (motorcycle roaring) - [Jesse] Hey, Easy Rider, you wanna slow it down a little bit? - Trust me, if she's goin' where I think she's goin', we need to get there fast. - Yeah, what the hell is she doin' down here? - Trying to exorcise a ghost. - Awe, come on, not you too. - Look, what I saw in your house is gonna make me president of the X-File groupies, okay? - [Woman] Help me. - [Marjorie Voiceover] Help me. Kelly. (thunder cracks) (rain pattering) Help me. Kelly. - Help, help. Help me, please. (thunder cracks) Someone, please. Help, please. Help me. (crying) - Help me. - [Jacob] You! - Mr. Hardesty, are you okay? - This hospital is full of pests. - You did everything you could. They should have believed you. - No. - I killed her. I killed her because I couldn't save her. - I saw it. You didn't kill her, she killed herself. I know you loved her. And it's not too late. - Ever since she died, I felt she was still with me. At first it was a comfort, but then she stayed... - She couldn't leave. Come with me. - She needs you. - What are we gonna do about this damn needle? - Okay. (Jacob Grunts) Here, put your arm around me. Whoa, whoa, careful. Lean on me, lean on me. Just go slow. - All right, but where'd she go? - The girl promised me a 20. - All right, I'll give ya a 50. - Like I told her, it's either the Parish Hospital or the Parish morgue. - Let's go for the hospital. Hey, you have a Mr. Hardesty on your list? Excuse me, Miss, do you have a Jacob Hardesty here? - Are you a relative? - Yes, he's my father. - Mr. Hardesty was here earlier waitin' for a room, but apparently left with a young girl. Your father really needs to be admitted. His condition is very unstable. - Hey, come on, let's go. - Thank you. - Come on! (soft music) - Hey, you know, we're not gonna do anybody any good if we don't get there in one piece. - I'm not lettin' anything happen to her. (motorcycle revs) (door creaks) (mysterious music) - Virginia? He's here. - Good Lord. - Yeah, it's, uh, Virginia's, uh, handiwork. Virginia? Jacob's here. She's here. She has to be here, so... - I never thought I'd come here again. - [Kelly] You have to see her. She has to see you. - She has to wanna be seen. A long time ago there was a girl that tried to solve the dilemma of Virginia. She was much like you. - Virginia? (door creaks) (door slams) (spirit whispering) (doors slamming upstairs) - Ginny? - [Cole] Car's here. - [Jesse] Good. - Come on. - Geeze, I'm tryin'. It's jammed. - What? - The lock is jammed. I don't know what's wrong with it. - [Cole] No, come on. (ominous music) (spirit whispering) (Jacob breathing heavily) (spirits wailing) - [Jacob] My God. Ginny. Why did you come back? - [Jesse] This is crazy. Kelly! Kelly! - You've given me 40 years of hell. 40 years. Was that the price I had to pay because I couldn't save our daughter? - Come on. - You're kidding me. - [Cole] Yeah, you're not that old. - Thanks. - You left me. You left me to live. To feel blame. You need to be forgiven. I can't. You left me when I needed you so much. - Come on. You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. Go ahead, come on, go, I'm right behind ya. (shutters creak) - Ginny, she was my daughter too. - Hasn't there been enough bitterness and blame? Haven't you both lost enough? - Oh my God. - [Kelly] Jacob you have to forgive her. - No! Don't go. (spirit whooshing) - You're seeing this, right? - Oh yeah. (spirit whooshing) (soft music) - Oh my God. My sweet angel. (Jacob grunts) - Dad, please, do something. - Okay, honey. You stay with him. I'm gonna call an ambulance. - Jacob, no. Jacob. - Goodbye, my sweet ones. (heartwarming music) I love you. I forgive you. I'll see you again. (spirits whooshing) - [Kelly] You're all free now. - It's harder to stay than to go. Whoa, careful. I got a bad heart. - I'll come visit you. - No need to. You've done enough. It's time we both got back to our lives. - Time enough for that. We'll see ya at the hospital. (engine starts) (siren blips) - Guess I should go. - Hey, Cole. See ya later. - Yeah. (Jesse chuckles) (soft music) - [Jesse] Here, I found this too. - [Kelly] That's Mom. In front of this house. - Yes, that's our house. And this. - It's her handwriting. - I found the diary and I found this picture. When I was looking through the boxes upstairs. And I remembered that your mom told me that she lived in New Orleans, a long time ago. But, I guess I didn't really pay much attention to what she said. And, uh, for some reason, though, this house, it just stuck in my head. (sighs) Your mom brought us here. - She never blamed me. - No, baby, no. No, she never blamed you. Nobody every blamed you. - Yeah? (crickets chirping) (mysterious music) (peaceful music) (soft music) (dramatic music)
