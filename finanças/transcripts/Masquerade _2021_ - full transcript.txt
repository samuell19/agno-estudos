We need to get a round of golf in. Man, I'd love to, but I got this old football injury. Whenever it gets cold, the arthritis kicks in, and my thumb just... Stiffens up. Thank you guys so much for coming and supporting such a good cause. Thank you. It really means a lot to me. - Absolutely. - Thank you. It's funny. I was in Paris last week on business, and my room key doesn't work. So I go down to the front desk to get another key. They give me one. I go back up. It doesn't work. We do this dance three or four times. Finally we realize that I was trying to get into my room from the week before. Jesus. You need this drink more than I do. Thank you. Maybe you should bring her to Paris next time. No, my friend, because unlike vou, I'm still happily married. Oh! Get up! What about our stuff? Leave it. Come on. Get the keys. Okay, okay. Over this fence. Come on. Come on. Get in the car. Ah, the keys. = hurry up! Hey, why did you do that? Because you're asleep. No, I'm not. Well, then even if you're not, how can you stomach this? Because I know it's all fake, and no one really dies. Well, it's gonna give both of us nightmares. I don't know why I let you talk me into watching this. Beats always watching cartoons or Princess movies. There's nothing wrong with either of those. It's what little girls are into. Casey, being a little girl is great. Trust me, you should want to stay one for as long as you can. So I can keep having a babysitter? Oh, okay. All right. If you've got it all figured out, I'll just tell you parents this is my last night, then. No, no, no, no. Please don't go. Please don't go. Please. So you want me to stay? Yes. Yes, definitely. I never, ever, ever want you to leave. I'm sorry I said those things. Remember, never remove your mask. Just as we planned. Exactly. The event you put on is really great. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. But I could not have done it by myself. It is a team effort thanks to you and everyone else who's working tonight. And it's for a really great cause. Yeah, and there's that. You know, one day I want to have exactly what you have. I'm sorry. I didn't, uh, mean for that to sound weird or anything. I just meant you seem to have it all. = the... the dream life. Oh, thank you. All these people that really love you and support you. It's... it"'s amazing. You actually remind me of my mom. Oh. That's really kind of you to say. Uh, red was her favorite color. She actually passed away several years ago. Oh, uh, I'm really sorry. No, it's okay. Don't say you're sorry. Um, I, uh, I didn't mean to dampen your mood. Sorry. Have a good night. Night. It's almost time. You have a good night, you guys. Yeah, thank you again so much. It was great to see you both. Good night. Just a minute. They're still here. Everybody's heading out, so they should be heading out soon, and I'll wait. Just do your part, and I'll do mine. And remember, turn off the security systems before you cut the power, right? Yeah. Okay, and don't forget to leave the door unlocked. Let's go. Can I get one more? Hey, babe. It's a little late for that, don't you think? It know. I just wanna make sure our baby girl is okay. I think she's probably been out for a while. Oh, good. She, uh, fell asleep on the couch and is going into her own bed. See? Nothing to worry about. Yes. Cheers. Ready to go? - Mm. After this. Mm. Whiskey breath. I guess I'm driving. - You've been drinking too. - Oh, right. What do you say we leave the car here and take an uber? Yes, yes. Safety first. I can drive you guys if you want. Oh, that's... that's a nice offer, but you don't have to do that. Yeah, we live, like, 30 minutes out. It's fine. Really, I don't mind at all. I'm just about to wrap up anyway, and if you're gonna pay another driver, I mean, might as well pay me. I could use the extra money. = it's fine with me. Yeah, why not? Okay. Cool. So I'll just go get the car and meet you out front, ten minutes? - Okay. - Yeah. Oh, uh, sorry. I'm Rose, by the way. = Olivia. - Daniel. Thanks. - That's nice. Yeah. All right. Did you brush your teeth? Yep. Hey, do you know when my parents are gonna be home? Your mom just texted saying they're leaving now. You'll probably be fast asleep before they get here though. Okay, well, in case I'm not, will you tell them to come up and say goodnight when they get home, please? = of course but I won't need to tell them. They always do. Sweet dreams, my beautiful girl. Oh, and tomorrow we're going... Oh, you were right. We shouldn't have watched that movie. This is all my fault. - this is not your fault at all. Then what just happened? Must be from all this crazy wind. I'm just gonna go downstairs, check the circuit breaker, and see if we blew a fuse. I'm just gonna come with you. No, just lay back down, rest your eyes, and I promise you that I won't be long. There's absolutely nothing to worry about. Will you just stay with me until I fall asleep? Yes. I'll do that. - Thanks, babe. - Come on. There she is, right there. They're back. I'll be there in exactly 37 minutes. - Drinky-drink? - Oh, I know. - A few drinky-drinks? - No, we're good. Thank you so much. Have a great night. Thanks. Hey. Are you sure you don't mind doing this? Trust me. It's... it's okay, yeah. - Appreciate it. - Okay. Oh, thanks, babe. All right. Shh, stay calm. We're not here to hurt you. Please. Oh, my god. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. What the fuck? No, just... Please. Please. Stop it. Stop, stop. This is not part of the plan. It's changed. = Sofia! Go get her. Okay. Ah! No. No. Please go away! Why did you do that? Why? What do you want? Please. Please just leave me alone. No. I can see you. Just leave me alone! Please! I'm really proud of you. Oh, thank you, babe. Tonight was a huge success, and it was all because of you. I couldn't have done it without you. We make such a good team, huh? Mm-hmm. Thank you for being so supportive. I love you. Come on. Where are you? Casey... That is your name, isn't it? Why don't you just make it easy and come on out? Casey... You're starting to make me very angry. Hey, babe. Come here. Okay. I'll be right there. What's going on? - I can't find her. - They'll be home soon. I know. What do you want me to do? Keep searching for her and let me know if you find any other artwork. Okay. Fuck. Baby, I'm sleepy. =I know. = I'm so tired. So, uh, besides charity work do you... do y'all have other jobs? Oh, we, um, we work in the art world. Oh. So you're, uh, you're artists then. - Oh, no. - No, we're brokers. We travel around the world buying and selling priceless works of art for our sellers and our clients. I mean, can it really be priceless if you can buy it or sell it? She's not wrong. It's just a figure of speech. I actually know a little bit about art myself. I, um... I'm an art major. Not a broker, obviously. Oh, wow. That's fantastic. Yeah. Yeah, you any good? He's kidding. Well, not really. It is my job. We would love to see your work. Come up. There's art in the master. Okay. I'll be right there. Wow. These houses... Maybe I should be an art broker instead. = no. Without artists, then we'd have nothing to sell, right? Mm. True. Do you have a favorite work of art? Um... Ti do. Yeah. Uh, "the son of man.” - Oh. - René magritte. Oh, interesting. A surrealist. That's the one with the man in the bowler hat with the green apple in front of his face, right? Ugh, I love that painting. Yeah. Why that one? Um... I think because we all wear different masks, you know, different situations, each relationship, and we always want to see what's behind the mask, vou know, what's... what's hidden. But sometimes we don't, sometimes we do. That's really impressive. Babe? What? = it still can't find her. Fuck. I'm on my way up. Well, I've looked everywhere. Ti have no idea where she is. Where did you see her last? She was in her bedroom. There's a dresser behind the door. What the hell are you doing? I'm telling you, she's not in here. I'll search these two rooms. You search the master. - I just did. - Do it again. She didn't just disappear. Goddammit. Yeah. Everything all right? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Friends just checking in on me. I'll, um, I'll call them after I drop you guys off. Oh, just go around this bend and then take a right at the first street, please. Okay. No. What the hell was that? Was that you? No. It's the girl. Holy shit. = what if she falls? She dies. Oh, god. No. We are not letting her die. Stay here. Okay. Oh, god. Catch her. Don't worry. I will. I'm here. Just let go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Please leave me alone. We can't do that. What do we do now? Find out how she got up there. And stay quiet. The parents could be home any minute. Oh, we just missed our turn. - Oh, shit, sorry. - It's fine. We'll just pull a u-turn up here, and we'll be fine. Okay. Okay. Somebody! Please, somebody help me! Please, anybody! Help. Please. I'm up here. Please help me. Please. Anyone, please. Help me. Please! Okay. Somebody, please! Mommy! Daddy! Just pull up a little bit, and I'll punch in the code. It's not working. =- hm. It's so dark down there. I'm gonna try calling them. I think the power's out. No answer. I'm sure they're both out by now. = hmm. It's been so windy tonight. Maybe that has something to do with it. Does this mean we're walking? Okay. I'm okay. Mommy and daddy are gonna be home soon. It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay. I'm gonna make it out of here. Thanks, babe. Thank you. = thanks. When was the last time you climbed a fence? Oh, man. It's been a while. Is there anything else I can help you guys with? I feel so bad. No, gosh. You've done plenty. Oh, no. No, this is too much. Ah, it's fine. It was a long ride. You deserve it, a starving artist. By the way, when you're ready, come and see us, okay? - I will. - Get home safe. Night. Ugh. Let's go that way. = yeah. Yeah? Ooh! Gosh, it's windy. Oh. - It's like we're teenagers. It know. This is not easy to do after drinking. They're just over the fence, so they should be inside any minute. Just remain where you are and make sure the girl stays quiet. We don't need any distractions. Oh, shit. The parents. Shit. I used to like our long driveway... Before we had to walk it. Yeah. How you doing in those heels? Oh, it's okay. Thanks, babe. I guess it's good 'cause I didn't go to the gym today. Babe, the parents, they're... I know. Come here. I need you to take care of her. Can you do this? Yeah, I've got it. I need you to do this. = it's fine. Let's just stick to the plan. You're right. Hey, remember why we're here. - We're gonna be rich. - Exactly. You know what? Let me see your phone. - Want me to call them again? - No, I left mine in the car, and I need your light to get us around the garage into the house. - Okay. - Thank you. There we go. Good idea, hon. = oof. Oh, man. Oh, it seems warmer in here. What the fuck? Huh. That's not going on either? Weird. Oh, we did it. - Huh. - What? It don't know. I wonder if we just blew a couple fuses. Oh, I don't know, sweetie, but, man, it's quiet in here. I am gonna go check on our girl. Wait, wait, wait. Help me find a flashlight so I can get to the breaker in the garage and turn the electricity back on. Oh, that's a good idea. Casey? I need you to remain calm and walk back down to me. No. No, I won't do it. Lower your voice, Casey. I wanna help you. You're gonna hurt me like you hurt Sofia. I didn't hurt her. He did. I stopped him from hurting her worse. I'm not a bad person. I want to help you, Casey. No, you're too scary. Well, I'm sorry, but I can't take the mask off. You have to. Then you'll see who I am, and I can't let you do that. Then I'm staying right here. Fine. I'll come to you. Here, baby. Let me help you. Oh, I know I definitely put a flashlight in one of these but of course I can't remember which one. Oh, aha. Here we go. Ha, yes. Good job, baby. I am gonna go upstairs and check on our girl. Hold on a second. Before you do, I need you to tell me if the lights come back on when I flip the breaker in the garage. - Mm. - Please. Okay. Take off your mask or come and get me. All right. I promise I'll take it off if you promise not to tell anyone about me. Do we have a deal? Casey, I need you to say it out loud. - I promise. - "I promise" what? I promise that I won't tell anyone about you. You know what happens to people that break promises. Bad things? Yes. Very bad things. - That's funny. - What? They all appear to be on. = hm. Okay. I fulfilled my part of the deal. Now it's your turn. Promise you won't hurt me or my parents. I will protect you, and I will make you a promise that I won't hurt you or your parents. You have my word on that. Just come to me, Casey. Okay. Nothing. Uh-uh. Hurry up. Quietly. Do what's right. That's a good girl, Casey. Just be careful. Take your time. Maybe a branch fell down on the power box in the yard? Um, in that case, I'm gonna head upstairs. Yeah. I'm gonna go out in the yard and see if it's a branch or if the whole power line came down. Okay. Be careful. Don't go to sleep yet. I'll be right up. = mm. Shh. Quiet, Casey. What was that? I-=-i don't know. Just come on. We'll go check it out together. There you go. Okay. Be careful. You're doing great, Casey. Come on. - Okay. She's out. Keep the girl quiet. Casey... Casey, what are you doing? Come on, just a little further. You're almost there. I don't think I can trust you. Sure you can. We have a deal, remember? Casey... Now you're really pissing me off, Casey! I'm coming for you. Have you seen her? Where's your mask? What were you thinking? What the hell did you want me to do? What was our most important rule? - Don't let them see our faces. - Exactly. I was trying to gain her trust. She wouldn't come over. I don't give a damn about her trust. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. That was the last thing you should have done. Goddammit! Ah! - Are you okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Oh... - Shh, shh. Did you hear that? I think they're back in the house. Okay. I'm going downstairs. You find her and shut her up. What the fuck? Babe? You all right? Jesus. Ah. Honey. Babe? This is really unlike you. Please don't hurt my family. That's completely up to you. You can save your wife and child though. However, if you don't give me what I need, don't be mistaken. I will kill them. Do you understand? Fuck! You want to save them? Yes, good. Where the hell is she? = t still haven't found her. How's your hand? = it's fine. But what about the parents? = taken care of. Just like you took care of the nanny? Everything's under control. I don't like this. I don't care. It was never part of the plan. And neither was letting the girl see your face. Well, I'm not hurting her. I knew you shouldn't have come. Stop. I'll find her. No withesses. Oh, my god. Oh. Don't make me threaten you. You know what will happen if I don't get what I want. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Top drawer. What's the combination? One-two-two-five-one-star. Shit. Was this Christmas? She's so lucky. She still has her mom. Little girls need their mothers a bit more than they need their fathers. Where are my parents? Whoa. Okay. Let's just put the gun down, okay? Where are they? It's you. Relax. We're not here to hurt you. We're just leaving. Are they dead? No, no. They're fine. You... you're stealing our art? That's all we want, and now we're leaving. I want to see my parents now. Okay. Okay. They're just in here. Mommy! Casey... We didn't come here to hurt you, but I want you to know for whatever time you have left... Do you remember what you said to me the first time we met? You are responsible. Casey Rose. You murdered everyone I love over my family's artwork. It's actually funny... Life is that way like, because... Now it's all going back to me where it belongs. Goodbye, Casey Rose. Don't you get it? The irony? Every single decision that you made in your entire life brought you to this moment right here. Stop. This is the one I've been looking for. Come up. There's art in the master. Can I have the seller's contact information? We're brokers. We travel around buying and selling priceless artwork for ourselves and our clients. Remember, we're doing this for my sister, Sofia, and your parents. = Sofia! He's definitely back from Paris. T was in Paris last week. Just do your part, and I'll do mine. Yeah. What do you say we leave the car here and take an uber? Oh, I can drive you guys. So then everything is good on your end. All the electricity's out. I just have to put the baby down. They're back. I'll be there in exactly 37 minutes. By the way, when you're ready, come and see us, okay? - I will. - Get home safe. Night. So... Really, it's you. You're responsible.
