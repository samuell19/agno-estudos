In the name of God. We're ready, Sir. Do we start. RASHT, December 2, Mirza Kuchak Khan Jangali's tomb. Action In 1917, King of Britain ordered general Dunsterville to open a way in Iran, The Orphanage of Iran It was to help the British forces who were taking possession of Baku's oil wells. Dunsterville asked his informant officer to Capture someone close to Mirza. So he'd move with full information to the Northern jungles that were in his control. That close person to Kuchak Khan was my father Mohammed Javad Bonakdar. He was known as Salar Khan among the Jangali's. Where are you taking us, Rayab-Gholi? I asked you where you're taking us? Seize him! Salar Khan is here! Seize him! Is this him? Yes it's him Surrender Salar Khan! You're surrounded. You ran out of bullets! I shot you in your right shoulder You'll survive! In his journal John Str aw wrote that...his rank removal by Dunsterville was The worst moment in his life. And that he sarcastically told him &quot;Salar is in Tehran&quot; Admit it, you're not capable enough, So that I'd arrest him by myself! I recall clearly how naughty I was when my Father was under medical checkup. An exhausted father, thinking pessimistic About anyone, even Mirza Kuchak Khan, Breathe! A deep breath! Don't you feel pain? No. You can even ride a horse! The horse? Hello! Sorry to be late, I was distracted. Are you distracted from now? Take Maryam! What medicine should I give you To forget about that long face? Forget about me, but have mercy On your family and these children! You're annoyed that because a British spy ratted on you? The British knows what to do You could've got into trouble Thank God, as those who found you Didn't hand you over to the British army, It's not about me It's about betraying one's country. betraying one's country isn't new to this land. Son, we've been left behind a hundred years We'll stay behind as long as they praise Paris and London in Dar-ul Funun. ...and make young students Long to serve for such countries. My husband is upset about what to do With traitors to country and prostitutes. Since they've ruined people's lives. Prostitutes go hell, but traitors To the country send their land to hell. There's no hope in this country; the Flood of the enemies has ruined the dams. I mean, let's act like a piece of wood For our families against this damn flood. Do you want me to turn a blind eye? On everything you do? I'm struggling within to be so, Uncle I'm disappointed in our country, For now, I look after people's bodies. I want to say, my brother isn't alright And your condition makes it worse. At least Pretend to be well in front of him. Goodbye! I want to have a word with you, it'd be better To talk in the absence of khatoun But khatoun is here now, Leave it for another time. I sent a message to khatoun via your Son, Mirza fazlollah Khan I asked her to tell Seqat ul-Eslam Not to challenge my discussions. Children have disordered the school, With what Seqat ul-Eslam has said, There you go! Wasn't it back biting Go and play! Go honey! Father take another sip, I can't! I don't like it! Brother! Have some of the new syrups if you don't Believe in herbalist's medicines, You're a master of skills! You've studied medicine in France. You know the benefits of herbs too! I have no appetite! I don't know what would happen to the orphanage After my death? Oh my God! You're still alive, father. You've entrusted me with this before. I told you that I'd manage it, I won't forget about those children Even if I forget Fazlollah and Azam. We've been engaged, but my dad Backed out and Uncle remained silent. Azam and I are undecided And without a choice. Leave your Uncle to me, But your dad doesn't listen to me, As I said threaten him! Yet, respect his as a father. You mean, telling I'd commit suicide? No! how should I say? Tell him, I'll go to the jungle, to Mirza Kuchak khan. My dad dislikes Jangalis, So? It's worth a try; it may be successful! Not maybe! My dad hates Jangalis a lot that he'd Even agree that I marry Halima Khatoun. It's ok then, Ya Ali! Hello! Hi! I'll come to visit you grandpa, when you get better, inshallah I'll be in your service May God be with you. Son, remember that here's your Iran. They've come by force, Ok grandpa! Uncle, doctor! Goodbye! May God be with you! Leave me alone! Cousin, cousin! I want to speak with you You're wrong! Azam is bad humored. They are orphans of Legal constitutional revolution. Don't let them be raised by the British Otherwise they'd take the ways Of their fathers to the British embassy. There's a village without famine, we've Bought wheat and barley from the chief. In Taleghan Take rest. We've got plenty of time tomorrow. Your British wife agreed! Didn't she hold the engagement? You were a pest, she wanted to make You busy with that kid while being here. Now she's gone it's over! But Azam and I really Damn Azam! I told you not to mention the name in front of me! Ok. So.. So, I'll go to the jungle, To Mirza Kuchak Khan, Idiot! General Dunsterville is coming to make A road for the British army fighting at Baku, British means half the world, That Jangali is done with those Few poor guerillas, understand this! Go and be the reporter of this Historic war as a real gentleman. Ra'ad and times newspapers Await your reports. Idiot son of mine. I'll go to Kuchak Khan! My depressed father didn't wanna accept The British had spies so close to Mirza. He sometimes used to say, good that Nobody knew where I live except Mirza And he used to remain silent. Hello! Hi! Come on we're just having fun! Hello Sir! Hi! Go away! Hi khatoun! Hello! Ma'am we've run out of flour, Hello Sir! Welcome! There you go! Good job! Hello ma'am! Hi! Hi Sir! Hello! Hello Sir! Think for the flour and beans! Give her to me honey! Mom, take her, I'm tired. Sorry dad! Have it! Dad! Dad! Syed Kazem's here! Hello Syed Hi! May God accept your pilgrimage What about the load? Didn't go well, Mirza The British seized it. Fazlollah doesn't ask for permission For coming into women's section. You're sparring all the time, Is it a good time for such works? Take her for dyeing with henna. Ok! Hi Sayed! May God accept your pilgrimage! Hello khatoun! What's up? They didn't let us take the load and Seized the caravan and camels by force. They've given us Imperial bank bills for 3-to-1 Give me my pen! Abdul ul-Sattar Get on, Seyyed! Hey! Hello! -Hi, good job! -hi -good job! - I have a word! -I sell pluck! - Give me 2 skewers! - Ok Sir! My father had a smart spy who was everywhere, as a ghost! He had even news from embassies. Halimeh Khatoun always used to say &quot;Your dad's spy is connected to jinns!&quot; -Hello! -Hi Don't be upset! You didn't drink tea! Leave it! I knew that you'd be informed sooner than me who was the load owner. Where are you going? We were speaking. Why did you get annoyed? Hi Mirza! He's as strong as a cow; he's Ramezun the ox, you know him! They're non-believers, but they are respectful. They buy camel with it's load. Whoever was in their shoes would capture them by force of sticks. They've already captured them by force of the stick! -Those loads are the orphans' food. -Don't say it; I'm caring and would cry! Boy! Say it to one who'd not know that... ...half of the food of Tehran's population is stored in that so called orphanage! Do you sell flour? I both sell and buy. This is my job! This is the bill of Imperial Bank. -Give me 1 load for every 3 loads. -You must be kidding! You can't even have one-hundredth of a load with this bill! It has gotten 40 times more expensive now. If you've really become a Muslim... Beware that I should give food to 150 orphans and servants every day. Take this bill for me at cost of 3-to-1! You can't even have a seed with it! Give it to me! What happened?! Seyyed Kazem! Let's go to our own caravanserai! You'll get back! What's with you? Why are you panicked as the chickens? Halimeh Khatoun, tell them to cook chicken for tomorrow. Each chicken that doesn't lay eggs. -Are you all right, Khatoun?! -Children haven't had meat for a month. We don't have millet to give to the chickens that don't lay eggs. The caravanserai of my grandpa Haji Abolfazl Bonakdar... ...used to receive lots of caravans every day. But things got to the point that my father blew his pride. Even though he'd not spoken to my uncle for many years. Ra'ad I've come for the sake of children. I've promised father that they'd be safe. -Their food caravan is seized. -You've promised not me, brother! Your caravan has already been the British Army's food. They've even grilled your camels! I can do nothing if I got to British. It's possible to have them back. They've not been eaten. I know they're waiting at the Indian border customs to see your authority... ...to give them back. Seyyed Zia would get angry. Newspaper's left behind for an hour. I came just for the sake of the children. It's a pity that Modarres has said they shouldn't complain if they'd e beaten. He said they should beat in order to make them file lawsuits! Otherwise, I would order to beat Kazem in order to divulge all of their storerooms! Embassy fears that the clergymen might be aroused. If they do, people would go after them. Najaf, Qom and Tehran are silent and hungry now. Or, they'd get their load at the Indian border and beat them instead of giving a bill. They'd beat them! Very well! You've got so strong, touch wood! What are you doing here, Mobarak? You wanna exercise too? I'll play music for you, go ahead! Mirza Mohammad-Javad! Set me free from your son! Seqat ul-Eslam is our son-in-law, I wouldn't talk behind his back. That's said so about him. He's known as a political clergyman Who's against such advanced countries. What backbiting is that? What the hell! Mojtahid said it was both lie and talking behind his back. He's not against progress and civilization; he's against the foreigners Kid, I'm saying what politics has to do with clergies and religion! Hello. Don't you like puppetry? Open the door! We're doomed! We're doomed! We became orphans! In his journal, John Straw wrote... &quot;I arrived to Tehran, the capital of Iran at 10 a.m.&quot; &quot;It was a city with a population of about 500 thousands at Alborz hillside.&quot; [Peace be upon Muhammad and his descendants.] One eyed British officer has come. They're orphans of Legal Constitutional Revolution. Don't let them be raised by British. Otherwise, they'd take the ways of their fathers to British Embassy. I had told you that I will manage it. I won't forget about those children even if I'd forget Fazlollah and Azam. Tehran, British Embassy. I asked for a reliable man who would know common people of Tehran. I was told it was you! -I am at your service, Sir! -I don't stand on ceremony as Iranians. If you'd not be successful... It's cholera, do you understand? It's contagious! They're infected with cholera; I'll die! I'll die like them! I can't! It's contagious! I'll be infected with cholera! I can't! They're infected with cholera. Don't you understand?! Those bodies are infected with cholera. I won't wash them! Their families said it was contagious. They're infected with cholera! It's so confidential. Nobody knows and must know about it except the Ambassador. -I emphasize; nobody! -You're being too serious, Sir! A lot has happened within last year. Russian Empire, Tsar has fallen. Ottoman Empire is falling apart. Germany is defeating. You'll have your rank back in a blink of an eye! Buster, who are you to comfort me? Just help me to find him! Sir, I'm a businessman I'm not a military man. But I'd sniff as a dog in order to find him for the sake of you. I'm not a military man. I'm a merchant, a reporter! These words would work to fool your own people. The reality is that everybody with every job would be a military man when... ...he works with our embassy. Didn't you recognize him? You won't find a man who'd look this in Tehran, Sir. They're in the jungle. You can't find them easily there. Either he'll be found or you would get lost from this world! God bless you! Hope to make up for you. God bless you son. Be seated, I'll leave with children. When will they close the orphanage? I don't know... I don't know who said it will be closed after Haji Abolfazl's death and the famine. You call him Mirza Fazlollah that has made him so bold! I told you at the funeral. Mirza Mhamoud's gout has reappeared after hearing of the father's death and is resting. He said holding reputable ceremony wasn't possible because of... ...the cholera and nobles' running of city -I disagree! Interfering in politics and taking religion into worldly affairs is a deadly sin. The result would be the famine and such illnesses. I won't speak to that political man. Goodbye! -Hope to make up for you! -I'm going on a trip. May I sit? -Be seated please! -What's the decision? We don't have a ceremony, Sir. Seems you'll never go in double harness with him! Everyone with smallest wisdom would realize that you both have some roots. And you both work for the British. You socialize with the riff-raff. Isn't it too late for your age? People deem helpers to the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay as a riff-raff. Not the louts of Bazaar Mosque! -Come! -Halimeh! They're engaged and the boy is going on a trip. -Is it the right time for it? -They're in love honey! Go and speak! -Hello! -Hi! I'll send you a telegraph as soon as I get there, God willing. It's dangerous at the border. Don't go; you don't have to! I've no choice and must prove that I can stand on my own two feet no matter what. All my reports will be published in Times and Iran, I'll constantly send telegraphs. I've butterflies in my stomach. Don't worry. It's not possible to talk about getting married now that grandpa has died. my fathers disagree as well, as usual! But I'll try to return within a month. Kudos to your British stepmother who brought about our engagement. We'll finally get into a luxurious wedding party in the garden; God willing! God willing! Keep your fingers crossed! Yes Halimeh? Coming! There you go! These children have become the pigeons on a roof. The famine gun has aimed at them. Here are the letter and the will. And here's the key. The letter is to the Chief of the village up the mountain. There's a village without famine. We've bought wheat and barley from the Chief. There's some money for such days. Your father has left a safe. It's my turn! Leave me alone! I searched half of Tehran, but I can't see him despite looking everywhere! I didn't recognize you! You are a trickster! I'm afraid that he'd find out about my presence and runs away. Otherwise, I'd surround the whole city. I'd search every house to find him. They don't know that it's my bakery who's giving them bread. -Let's go! -Don't come! I won't! Seyyed Kazem! Move! It's not possible, Mirza. It's a fight. Step away, man! How are you doing, guy? Let's go to by chamber! It's so empty that can't be called the storeroom anymore. It'll be filled tonight, won't it? They're on the way, Seyyed kazem will take them here at night. Pour it in all the pots! -Why are you crying? -I don't want to be hairless. You won't be hairless, dear. Do you want me to be hairless? -Yeah. -yeah? -Cut it, Sabzali! -But Mirza! No buts! both my head and face! -Cut! -Ok Mirza! I saw that somebody escaped. Oh my! God damn you, Officer! Why did you shoot Fathali? He reported me caravanserai's way. -Help me, Mirza! -Ok, I will. Help him, Officer! Let's see if anybody would need help. He'll regain consciousness now. Let's pay a visit to the storeroom, son! Give him a pill if he would have any pains! You see, Uncle? I wanted to keep it to myself, but they don't let us. -They say eat the tail with wolf cry with the shepherd -Close your eyes on thousands of people who are dying of hunger in front of you &quot;-Otherwise we'll fight with you ! there's no other choice , but fighting! -Fight !? With whom ? -Read it ! Look how it says about British services to Iranians in such condition! -They're intellectuals of this country . How do you wanna fight with them ? -Son , Britain is a monster with thousands of hands . -It's got Lots of clergies, reporters, spies, jangalis and authorities in each sleeve -Take your family to the village up the mountain. -Forget about cholera, famine and Britain ! -Or if that one eyed British - I'm making his coffin ! -I weighed them the flour you sent wasn't enough. - everybody realized. I sent little flour? Hello ! - we spend money for the army and will cover part of it by seizure ; so slowly! -You tricked the army and embassy . Your share has changed to 1 percent - but mine is 5 percent, sir ! - listen! I must find that guy before general dunsterville gets here . -You're being too serious, sir ! - you'll get the news of your children's death from London if I don't find him . - they're in London , right ? -yes sir ! They're in London. - it was January 1st, 1918 at 7 a.m that general Dunsterville entered Iran -Russian revolution at 1917 had already taken place . - the confidential treaty by which Russia and Britain had divided Iran divulged. - it had made such an atmosphere against Britain among Iranians. - general Baratov and colonel Bicherakhov supplied Britain with their whole army. - so , the Britain had an army in Russian uniforms for their crimes - you're taken seriously as sir Moling's order . So don't speak much ! Get in ! Hesam used to send telegraphs for Azam constantly, expressing his love . The embassy used to eavesdrop all telegraphs , including Hasam's It used to send a copy of it to my uncle, Mirza Mahmoud. Reuters reports terrible news about famine in Iran to British papers . I shake by reading them . We just write one-tenth of it . Iran has 80 thousand Jews and 20 million Muslims . It's better that they become 80,000 as a matter of equality and brotherhood. -no need to shake and fever then ! you evil ! Jews , Armenians and Zoroastrians are also dying now . The jew who wouldn't be able to improve his work in such condition has better die ! Take it ! Here's the bill of your share delivery. Where's Mosayeb? It's noon Didn't I tell you to check downstairs for Mosayeb and see if he's packed things ? We should take the remnant food to orphanage. -Fazlollah uses toilet too much! that's none of your business! I saw Mosayeb and his wife going to the garden late at night . They pinched everything, khatoun ! Fazlollah ! Fazlollah ! Hurry up son ! Let's rush to the garden. They must've taken them to garden. Ok! Khatoun! -take care of Maryam ! -don't order ! Mosayeb ! Did you take the flour and wheat to orphanage? No khatoun ! The alley was full of rebels and hungry ones last night as I was getting home ! Mosayeb! -what are you doing , Mosayeb? -don't get close khatoun ! Zobeideh khatoun is dead ! Oh my ! Why ? She'd gone to visit her sick sister. When she got back, she said that her sister was dead because of cholera. She took her sister's children with her . She got ill last night , so did I. We came here in order that you and children wouldn't be infected. Get up ! I'll take you to the doctor No ! You'll be infected! Fazlollah , come off it ! Let's ask for your dad and uncle ! Come off it ! It's contagious, fazlollah! We drank doogh together yesterday we drank tea by each other's cups too -I've already been infected if it's cholera. Fazlollah! Let me come too . You can't! Fazlollah! Go to the hospital. Don't go to the orphanage! Ask your uncle to come out . Fazlollah, don't go to orphanage! The children would be infected, fazlollah! Fazlollah, did you have diarrhea? Yep , I didn't touch Maryam and Azam . I washed the toilet too . Fazlollah! Uncle! Sir ! The doctor is my uncle! Doctor! Uncle! Uncle! What about the helps of British chancellor and embassy? Bastard ! Have you come to take souvenirs among people's vomits? Once you signed Turkmenchay treaty As you believed that the Armenians , Uzbeks and Georgians were useless . Once you signed Gulistan treaty and said brine had no use for us You've given the whole country to Britain under pretext of growth and civilization . What else has remained to take to them ? Rascal , I want aspirin and Quinine ! I want sugar and salt ! They're dying . They're infected with cholera and typhoid. They're infected with plague! Do u wanna see ? Look ! See what you wanna take as souvenir for the British! These young people know what's going on in this country well ! But the know that their future would be supplied by obeying British rulers. If they're not blind or deaf they can understand that . Uncle! It's fazlollah! A whole nation's dying in few weeks . -sir , the doctor is my uncle! -and all are just vulgar and Step aside! Get going, don't stay ! It's full Open the door ! Shemiran's Tighestan was the hangout at which British used to gather at nights . My father ambushed and waited there for John Straw to kill him . Fazlollah is infected with cholera. But was unsettled by hearing that my brother was infected with cholera. Doctor said that you might never see him again . He's calling for his father so much . Uncle, this illness shouldn't get into the orphanage. This country has changed to an orphanage. They don't have a forerunner. He'd go ahead if they had one . So we'd not be so humiliated by dying in such dirt and filth. We'd die with glory at least. Everyone would survive by taking a pill and some syrup but we don't have ! Where can the medicine be got from ? 'it's rumored among doctors that Dusterville's caravan has medicine for thousands to prevent and treatment. Even a doctor's suggested giving gold in exchange for it but they've rejected . -can you buy from them? yes , I can . We know each other . I'll buy from him . Do you let us inform them to have the funeral tomorrow? No , tonight! Don't inform women . Hold on ! 10 Tomans ! He says give 3 kilos bread for the gravedigger and mortician or you should pay 10 Tomans . Dig them yourself if you don't have any . Mirza , a British car is coming. Brother Ali ! -Where's my horse and gun ? you go . I'll take them for you . Sir ! One of my friends works in publishing newspapers for 20 years . I'll show him this photo if you permit. That Jangali would escape if he realizes that I'm here . Or I'd stick the photo on the wall . I'd also announce a prize of 10 thousand Tomans for his arrest too . Sir , my friend's wife is British. He's a diplomat at Indian embassy. He's a close friend to sir Moling. Mirza Mahmoud Khan! You can't have a ball without mistress. Haven't they closed this damn place ? I admit I loved my son to be at least the chancellor of this country. That's why I sent him with Dunsterville's caravan . In order that he'd f orget about that stupid love . However.. He'd fallen in love even more ! He loves the handmaid of orphans of Sheikh Fazlollah Nouri's novices. Officer ! Let's dance ! We both have lost something . You , an eye ! Me , a son ! You look for that Jangali and I.. Come ! So you don't wanna dance . What would you drink ? Cognac or champagne? -both are gifts from emperor George V . -look at me I've an important question. Along with this excellent medal. But my silly boy.. I'll drink from this one . Brandy ! Never talk to an officer of British army that way ; especially if he's a nobleman. All the dogs at Buckingham Palace have several medals like that. Recognise that photo! Rascal! Oh my! I neither have flour nor dough Sangak Bakery bakes every two hours in Bazaar Go home! There's no bread. Don't you have zeal? People were exhausted of famine. They used to stand in bread ques for hours to get a piece of bread. In a bakery people got angry because one of the cops had insulted an old lady. So they protested into the Law Enforcement Office. We presumed that British Envoy would expel the guy to the front. King of Britain accepted me to go between as he'd given that medal. Otherwise, your body had been food for famine-stricken people of country Sayyed Zia! Do you approve that I've been at both Iron and Zargandeh commities? -Just the same as you and Taghizadeh! -Yes! No doubt, a fervent member and a skillful spokesman! And do you approve that if there weren't intellectuals like us... ...could that one-eyed officer dare to show off in Tehran like that? Weren't I with you, Taghizadeh and other intellectuals who attacked... ...Sheikh Fazlollah's tyranny and Legal Constitution Revolution? We ruined his face, so that nobody would dare to take part in his funeral. Weren't they the guys at the Iron Committee who... ...shot at that reactive man, Sayyed Abdullah Behbahari one year later? It was me who provided grounds for... ...Sayyed Mohamed Tabatabae's exile, exclusion and ruining With my wounded hand and my pen? With various papers and your Ra'ad! Was it my reward whose writings made powerful Modarres a vagrant? So, that silly officer humiliates me like this! Of course, they weren't just the intellectuals. Many have gone through pain, so that Clergies as Asadollah Kharaghani... ...and Ebrahim Zanjani understand the importance of civilization. And also help in controlling Clergies of Najaf to get rid of Sheikh Fazlollah. I want you to be with us. -We'll wait for your written apology. -Sir! Mirza Mahmoud Khan told me before this meeting that... ...he worried the history won't do Sayyed Zia justice You smart Jew! We write the history and teach it. If you live another 100 years, you'd see that always an Anglophile judges history. Your words are kinda different with what Colonel Haig used to account... ...when establishing the Iron and Zargandeh committees, Sir. Mirza Mahmoud Khan! Mathematicians would rule the world now if accounting was useful. Write as this example! Fazlollah! There you are! Be seated! Sit and write as the example! Be seated, son! We've come so astray. We'll get ahead of the British Army after we pass that snowy mountain. Before Asad-Abad Move! Come! Come on! -Don't stop! -Move! Come! Mohammad-Javad! Come! Brother Ali! Bring that animal! Bring it! Move! Come on! Put the load of donkey on the mule. Take it to behead and give it to people. The villagers were escaping to north of Iran from death, famine and illness. It was said that Mirza Kouchak Khan had supplied 700 thousand people... ...with food and a place to sleep. Sometimes the way of Dunsterville's caravan and such dying people merged. So, they bivouacked by one another's side. In his journal, Dunstervile has described this condition. You've seen the entire Iran. You've seen Europe as well. You've worked at the most important papers of the world. Why can't our officials save the country? Frankly because you don't deserve it We don't deserve? No You speak so offensively! This is proven political strategy behind their leader the world kneels You're timid! In last ten years your leaders have died alone; their blood is on your hands Read the history a little bit, young man! Go to your people see the fear we strike in their hearts I'm off to the general Meat! -Don't fear, son! It's me. -Uncle, you're here?! Tehran is filled with cholera, typhoid and typhus. Fazlollah died. Children at orphanage would soon be infected as well. How's Azam? -All would die if not taking medicine. -Isn't there any medicine? -It's in their hands. Thousands of Russian and British soldiers; but none died of illness. Do you want to talk to them? I might be able to satisfy and take medicines from them. The foreigners will give you nothing by talking while they're pointing a gun at you. Just tell me where the place of their medicines is. Don't milk it, it has nothing! The poor children that I took from the door are dying. Take this one as well. We've moved 30 ones to quara ntine last night. What should we do about their food? No Halimeh, don't come to quarantine! Wish that all losses and disasters would be a dream. They're asleep! The beggar is asleep as well as Shah. Why should these children die in their mothers' hands if they are awake? Take him upstairs and burn his clothes! -Bath him then! -OK Doctor! She's turned black! I don't know if it's out of hunger or illness. She's dead. -Take her outside Doctor! Help, Doctor! Why did you come to this? Where were you in fected? There was a child on the roof I was infected by her. You didn't go to the kitchen, did you? I just went to the toilet. Nobody should go to the kitchen until I've done checkups on everyone. -Even Halimeh! -Get inside! Take the children inside! Close the door! He should be buried at night so that nobody realizes. If we take her beside Fazlollah, all would be informed... What are you doing here?! Halimeh Khatoun! -3 children have gotten ill in the women yard. -Hush! Go! She's recovered. She'll go to her relatives for few days in order to rest. -What's up, honey? -I got sick. -Did she have diarrhea? -No! -Do you have pain? -Yep. What's up? Why did you come here? Take this child home! Don't you see my miseries? -Why do you behave so? -I get bored at home! To hell with it! I'll send Beigom to take care of you. Aziz, prepare the carriage! OK Khatoun! Nothing's wrong with her. -What's the matter? -It's nothing. -Isn't it typhoid or cholera, Doctor? -No, they're just frightened. They're right! I'm frightened as well. Here's infected with plague. Let's go! The fires are fresh. It was first the famine. Then cholera and typhus. And now, the plague has begun. We set fire to it in order to make the infection less. Hello mother! Has anybody survived here? What a polite rebel! We're looking for shelter. Turn behind the village! -Some are still alive. -Let's go! We all are infected with a sickness. But he is not. He was the head of barn at Maragheh. The British set fire to the barn under the pretext of not letting it go to the enemy. He survived! I fired where you're sitting yesterday. It's totally safe! Rest assured. Have your dinner! Help yourselves! You're not running out of food! Yes; if some would come every night and would have a mule. We'd be in good condition. It's the only safe way. It's got tolls; at least a mule! -I want a uniform of British Army. -We have! It's got holes and it's bloody. It'll have it be washed Two of their watchmen saw that my daughter had found a rabbit. She wanted to take it for her sick husband. The British attacked her. She escaped, but they followed her. Her husband killed one of them and he died as well. My daughter killed the other one. The British will have to pass here by tomorrow. Help to get the tolls for the food of these hungry people from them. We'll help each other! Go and see what they want Yes sir! They ask what the matter is. What do you want? Bread or anything that would feed these people. Are the medicines still in that carriage? Uncle! They're sick! Are the medicines still in the carriage next to the last in caravan? Yes, they're there. You didn't see me! Get going! OK! They want food We're not a damn charity We can run over them Tell the story of this kindness by British army for your grandchildren. If we had a forerunner '€¦ These people would be at your throat if you'd pass a bit from our border What ? What does that mean ? What does that expression mean ? Be ready! The carriage is coming Get out ! We finally came in use! Open the door ! Why did you ask not to take all of the medicines here uncle ? I thought they might come to look here for you and take my medicines too . Come up ,son ! Let her pass ! Go down with your glass ! I'll give these . You give them water ! Go son ! Doctor had a message for you . If you wash your hands before every meal and drink boiled water the cholera won't be scary. - It won't ! - It won't - It won't be scary . Bravo ! You went to entertain him ! So that the thieves of the carriage would be out of his sight .. No ! Speak wheneve you'd recall I don't know ! Abd ul-Sattar sold food to my father in exchange for Lots of money and jewelry -he was greedy to seize them later. What's with you ? -hello Mirza! -hi -stand over there! -Hello ! You told you'd come to caravanserai. You wanted to sell them expensive and I couldn't provide the money. That's why I've come to your house. Take it ! It's as we'd agreed on ! I'll come to take them at your caravanserai. I'll count them ! Your late father had a ruby ring about which we spoke. He didn't sell it . I swear to kill you if you send less stuff than you must or you wanna trick. But the routes aren't secure. Give it to me ! How do you wanna take them ? With a hundred armed louts, we won't give them one single grain of wheat. Even if we'd face a whole army ! Be at my caravanserai at down . Don't forget! Shah of Iran was getting ready to go on a trip abroad. He was changing his prime ministers on and on . But things were getting worse everyday The reliable and religious people of each city began to help famine- stricken ones . In Shiraz , 10 thousand people died out of English flu or grippe. So , Sheikh Mojtaba Mahallati took an action. In Esfahan and Kashan , Haji Najafi did the same . And in Tehran. Seqat ul-Islam Isfahani did it on behalf of Modarres . Step away! Clear the way !- Hello ! Clear the way ! Step aside! Step away ! -may I come in ? -hi Haji '€“ hi , hello -welcome sir ! God bless you ! I've ordered them to add 5 rice bags for today to have plenty of food . Mostofi said 300 hundred kilos of wheat and barely should be baked. In order that people of Tehran would be fed . People wouldn't be fully fed with little amounts of Dampokhtak, sir ! They come back to the queue to get once more over and over ! -that'd be as you see ! -they won't die instead! -distribute the Bills stealthily! I've distributed them . -are they real , sir ? -mind your own business! OK! Give it to me ! Come forward! [Peace be upon Muhammad and his descendants] I'll pay a visit to Azam and Maryam then I'll go to fazlollah's tomb . I'll be right back .- take a rest . You'd be torn apart! I'm a mother! Shouldn't I see my children? Don't worry about her . I'll take care of her attentively. -I know him as well as his mother. -seriously ? Who's he ? Sir John Straw ! You owe me a written apology . -write it ! who is he ? Excuse me for a moment! Come ! You'll get in your first place if you kill him ! Patience! He'll write it , sir ! -write! I will ! Seriously? Who is he ? Say who took the carriage? Put yourself at ease! We'll finally get into a luxurious wedding party in this garden ; God willing. Keep your fingers crossed! We'd have nothing if he goes to his house. We can't find him either. What if he'd go to the orphanage and wouldn't find him ? It just need a pressure from you and seyed zia . Bring the envoy in ! He's already a disgrace! Fifty- fifty, whatever it'd be ! You've complex about estates transfer to your brother by your father .. '€¦ and wanna make up for it . What do you want to share for ? Shut up ! All right . Fifty-fifty! Yes ! Where's he , doctor? He's not here ! You've already searched everywhere. Where's he ? Sit down! Sit! Sit down! Be seated, kids ! Easy ! Where's Muhammad Javad Bonakdar? Run ! No ! Don't run ! Ya Hussain! Where's he ? Let them go . Then I'll tell you . Where's he ? Shemiran ! At his house with his family. His house? Isn't it here ? Here's his workplace . It's an orphanage! If you trick Help yourself! Every spot of Iran that Britian has stepped... ...famine and illness have moved into it as well. My brother is the head of this paper. It says Russia is in charge for the famine. They have left this country for a year. Sistan and Baluchestan, Kerman os Shiraz! Russia has never gone there! But they're facing famine too. Ofcourse, famine and tuberculosis have always existed. But it's odd when all over the country gets into sickness and hunger! Hello sir! I'm sorry! Ramezun, Javad is going to be arrested! let's go! Hurry up, idles! Ramezun! Handle the meats! -Sir! -What's with you? Halimeh Khatoun was looking like this! Is she here? I'm scared, sir! Hello! I was taking them as a loan. They're orphans. You know that well. It shouldn't get into the hands of non-believer British ones. Here you are! Azam was the first who got the news of Hesam's death. Hesam! No! What are you looking at?! He's peeing! Halimeh! What? Sir! Tell khatoun to come in front of the gate of the abandoned water serervoir. Ok sir! He can't come by the yard. Go to the abandoned water reservoir from up here! Go! Are you ok? -We're all ok. -The kids? The kids are ok too. Are you all right? I'm going to the jungle; somehow that the British would realize about it. They'd leave you alone then, we have moved the foods to a secure place. Brother Ali and Seyyed Kazem will provide you with them. Be strong! When would the peace be our share then? We'll fight as long as our kids wouldn't have to fear the British officer and the ambassador Or any other foreigner! -We've come for the bills, sir. -So? A moment! Yes please? Does the British understand our language or not? -No! -Are you sure? Rest assured! They're so mischievous! I'll keep an eye! -Roll it around while speaking! -As I said, we've come for the bills. Haji! The British want to know something. Where would you get such amounts of rice, mung beans or even this one... a bowl of sheep meat! None of my business! -Here you are, haji! -Give me the fire! They say you are behind the story. They say that Modarres has become Sunni and has left to Ottoman! They say the Law Enforcement runs with the hare and hunts with the hound! People say lots of things! Entertain that guy! -You know me, sir! -Yes! I've been a follower of Modarres and I already am. They oppointed me at this position by his force. As you know, it's about 3 years that the Britian has not paid the 25% share of Iran... ...from oil that is was to pay according to D'Arcy Concession. Because of the culprits' damage to the oil pipelines. It even doesn't pay the trade profit and share of customers that was due to pay. The Chancellor says that it owes about 10 million dollars and 20 million Liras. But they don't pay, as they're strong! The statesmen are not capable too. They're dependant to foreign states. They don't dare to oppose them. Lot's of people would survive even if a small part of that money had been paid. A mule that used to cost 15 Tomans has changed to 300 Tomans! Wheat that used to cost 15 Tomans has changed to 300 Tomans! Officers and soldiers have not had their wages paid over a year! -They're hungry, my man! -What do you expect from me now? -You tell him! -Excuse me, sir! take it! Haji! God bless you! What we want to say is this; If there is any bills of rice, bread, wheat or anything, don't forget the Law men! -It has a condition! -What's that? Law enforcement should watch where the crowd goes tomorrow. All right! Neither arrest nor beat anybody! Frighten the British! Tell them that it'd be a rebel at the city if they enter the district. Or tell them that people would grab hold of Embassy. Say such lies that you sat to frighten us in order not to speak. Say those to them this time! -Yes! Send some carriages tomorrow I'll give you the share of Law Enforcement. -Ok! Ok! Haji! I should make a fuss, do you permit? yYes? Go ahead! What's going on, sir? I'll file a lawsuit against you! I'll report it to the authorities! You're responsible for all, haji. I know what to do in prisons from now on! Welcome to brother Ali's house! Thank you! -Ramezun? -What? Why Abd ul-Sattar thinks that you're stupid? I'm not stupid! We beat him to death, but he didn't say where his storehouses are! We said we'd ask Ramezun. He said Ramezun was stupid. I'm not stupid! I know all of them. All right! Let's go to see if you know! I know, I'm not stupid! Let's go! -Get up! -Let's go! I'm not stupid! I know! The red sheep is here as well as the lentil bags that they stole from us. We should take them to the orphanage from the rear window. Let's take as much as we can before people would get here. Go ahead! The storehouses of Shah are full of food. Some of these storehouses are open in Sangelaj district. Go there quickly! Give the bills and get your portion. Hurry up! About 9 million people were dead in that famine. It is more than Mongol invasion of Iran. But as Britian was responsible for the holocaust, it was nearly buried in history. There's not a significant work written on this disaster so far. Not even a page is on it in textbooks in all grades of the school and university. We'll give the share of Law enforcement from the rear window. -Come with me! -Let's go! You should have killed them all! Take all of them back before General Dunsterville and Sir Rothschild arrive. Take them to the store house.kill anybody needed! I heard it! did you say that the storehouse had been Shah's? Sir, they had been for a friend of the Great Britain and Sir Charles. Britain has neither a friend nor an enemy. we just have interests! Sir Percy Cox, the new Envoy and I heard you said that... ...the storehouse had been Shah's -Yes sir. The storehouse had been for the Shah of Iran. Be carefull not to take the British government into this story! As you wish; it's between your people and your Shah. Ok sir! Goodbye! John Straw had failed. But he convinced the Ambassador that my father was in caravanserai. He got the permission to arrest him. You little fox! When would the Lords of this den be fully fed with killing? Hundreds of people? Thousands of people? In 10 years? In 200 years? When? My father was vegrant in other cities and villages till the collapse of Reza Khan. He lived secretly. When he returned the papers propagated on the story of killing... Reza Khan's opponents with injecting air by Dr. Ahmadi and Mr. Mokhtari. My father said the propaganda had no use. What I told was wether seen by myself or heard from my parents. I had read some in the journals of the British officers that my father had got... ... or had been published later on. Wish you never experience such days! Wish my father was alive and see these days.
