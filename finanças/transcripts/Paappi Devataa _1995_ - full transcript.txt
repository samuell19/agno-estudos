Please ask him to sit on the other seat for a while. All right...Sir! Yes? - Can you sit there for a while? We want to eat our meals. - All right. Come over here... And you move aside. How about sharing the food? - No, thank you. If I share the food with you, you'd fall short of it. People hailing from Allahabad, eat a hell of a lot. Allahabad is your hometown, is it? - Yes. I belong to the land of... ...Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and the land of the river Ganges. Even my wife hails from that place. - ls she also from Allahabad? Yes. Take it, dear. Can I sit here? - You are most welcome. Greetings... Are you traveling to Bombay? - Yes. You must be going to Bombay to become a hero in films! No. I am going to Bombay in search of employment. And what thereafter? - A girl, of course... What thereafter? - Marriage, followed by kids. We people from Allahabad believe in family planning. You are from Allahabad?! How wonderful! People from Allahabad are very intelligent and good folks. I had visited Allahabad during a singing festival in 1985. I'd sung a song there. People were thrilled with my singing. Even the kids in Allahabad are very fond of singing. You too must be very fond of singing, aren't you? I sing sometimes. - Please sing then... If you sing, I'll provide the music. Please sing. - All right. Attention, please...he's singing a song for all of us. "I'll say something. Something, you say..." "I'll say something. Something, you say..." "this journey shall end and we'll get on with our thing" "This little meeting of ours..." "may move on with the running train" "Play the harmonium, O musician..." "O musician, play the harmonium" "play a tune from the movies" "Here's the bride. Here's the bridegroom..." "Let the bridal procession move forth" "I'll say something. Something, you say..." "this journey shall end and we'll get on with our thing" "Life's a journey, and we're all travellers" "Even though we're strangers to one another" "Should we meet someplace ever again..." "we shall extend a hand of love" "I'll say something. Something, you say..." "this journey shall end and we'll get on with our thing" "This little meeting of ours..." "may move on with the running train" You are a very good singer. Where's my luggage'? Excuse me...l hope you are not taking away my luggage! No, it belongs to me. And this belongs to me. - Then where is my luggage? This is Bombay. You should be as careful as you can. Somebody might dupe you without your ever realising it. Looks like somebody has alighted from the train at a earlier station. You should remember this first lesson that you are learning here. I'll surely remember the lesson. But I've lost my luggage, all right. Moreover, I don't know a soul here. God will take care of you. We should be leaving now. Want me to carry your luggage? - Somebody has already flicked... ...my luggage. Why would I need the help from a coolie now? My wallet! Looks like somebody has stolen my wallet too. I had kept my money and the ticket in the wallet. That means you've received a big "phatka". What did you say? - "Phatka" (a blow). Don't you know what that means? - No. It means this is your first visit to Bombay. You are right. Tell me somethingmis there any way to get out of here unnoticed? Yes, there is one. Do you see that fence over there? You had better jump over it and slip out of here. A special check for tickets is in progress over there. You'll be thrown behind bars if you're caught. Do you understand? Hey! Where are you going? Seems like he's traveling without a ticket. Who is it? Why did you enter my taxi stealthily? I am not a thief. Why is the policeman chasing you? What have you stolen? - I have stolen nothing. In fact, I've been robbed of my belongings. Where? - In the train. Even my wallet has been stolen. It contained my traveling ticket. I came out of the station without a ticket. That's why he's chasing me. Please help me. - Are you speaking the truth? People from Allahabad never lie. Please help me. You hail from Allahabad? Yes. - Don't worry then. Not a single policeman can harm you now. Mind your hand! So you've come from Allahabad? - That's right. But why were you astonished when I told you that? I too hail from Allahabad. How can I bear it if somebody from my hometown is put to inconvenience? What's your name? - My name is Raam. My name is Rahim. Where was your luggage stolen? - Between Dadar and V.T. Between Dadar and V.T? Then you could get back your luggage. How will that be possible? Cabbies in Bombay are well-informed about the whereabouts... ...of cops, thieves, pickpockets. You'll get back your belongings. I have to finish a task. A passenger had left behind his luggage... ...in my taxi yesterday. Let me drop his goods. Then I'll help you too. I'll be back soon. You're so late. The boss has been enquiring about you. Where is he? - In the hall inside. Stay here. I'll be back. - Which place is this? This is called Sadhu Nagar. The thieves stay here. Your goods will be recovered from this place. Shall I accompany you? - Stay here. I'll return soon. Hey! Look over there! He must be going to sell his goods. Let's go. Any of this stuff belong to you? - Hey! Who are you? How dare you enter inside? Come on! Get lost from here. Better watch yourself. Or I'll break your limbs. Who's this scoundrel? How dare he hit out at my man? He's Rahim, a taxi driver. How dare an ordinary taxi driver barge into my house? He's my friend. He's come from Allahabad today itself. You must know where Allahabad is. - You had better talk business. Don't you act smart. His luggage has been stolen between Dadar and V. T. That area comes under your jurisdiction. You had better return his goods. Or else, you know what I can do. He had better forget about the goods that he has lost. Ask him to drink a glass of cold water and get lost. I'll surely get back the goods. - What if I don't give it? I know how to make an elephant spill out sugarcane. Throw him out of the place. You tackle the others. I'll bash this scoundrel! Where are the goods? Tell me, or I can be real mean. I'll tell you. Hey Raju.. Bring back his goods quickly. Where you want to go? I'll escort you. - Please leave me at a rest house. Rest house? There are no rest houses in Bombay. There are only guest houses, hotels or footpaths. I'll live somewhere on the footpath. - How can you say that? I managed to get back your luggage today. What if you lose it again? What are you capable of? I've done my graduation from the Allahabad University. But that means nothing. Graduates work as cleaners in Bombay. Can you drive cars? - Yes. I can drive a car. That's good. One of my friend owns a cab. He's looking for a driver. Till you get a job, you can drive the taxi and live in my room along with me With you? - Why not? Come on, let's go. What do you think of yourself? You mess around with your cab every day? Why aren't you careful?! Hey! I hope you aren't too hurt? - Who are you to ask me that? I am Ram Kumar Singh. This is my friend. He's come from Allahabad today. From Allahabad? - Yes. The land of Ganges and Yamuna rivers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. And you and Rahim too? ls this what happens in Allahabad too? What if I were to hurt my feet? - Even then I would've married you. Then I could've addressed you as my dear handicapped Rosy. Brother Rahim What is it? I have received a fresh stock of original Maghai betel leaves. Shall I make one for you? Shut up, will you? You always serve me fake stuff. Everything that's available here is unoriginal. Be it a betel, milk, tea, alcohol, or even human-beings! Who's he? - He's my friend from Allahabad. Who's come from Allahabad? - He's standing over here. Greetings. Not again. I was cheated once. I won't tolerate it again. Won't you mend your ways? Sorry brother You had better explain to him. He pickpockets my own friend. Go and remove the luggage now. - All right. How about a cup of tea for everybody? Yes. I'll fetch it rightaway. - Let's go. Good bye. This is my home. I'll fix your bedding too. Till you get some job, you may drive my taxi and live here. I hope you will not be inconvenienced if I stay here. Why should I be inconvenienced? Rahim... Who's Rosy... Rosy is my darling. She lives in the locality with her mother. Her father is no more. She runs an eatery and manages her livelihood. Here it is. Prepare meals for two people now. Ram will be staying here henceforth. Why? ls he related to you? He's closer to me than my relatives. He's a graduate. He's going to become a big officer. If you get a job as a officer, you may hire me as a watchman. What if I get a watchman's job? - Then I'll work as your officer. You are too smart. I hope you will eat your meals early tonight. Why? Do you have to visit some dance recital? No. I have an urgent work. I will have to go out. May the Almighty bless you. Just like you care for us, may the Almighty help you prosper, too. Rahim! You have come? - My greetings to you. May the Almighty bless you! Where do you roam about for so many days at a stretch? I am always so anxious to see you. You know that I have to travel all over driving my taxi. As soon as I get time, I come straight to meet you. If you continue to follow this pattern... ...you might get to know some day that I have already passed away. No...please don't say like this. I'll always live under your shadow. Whenever I read the holy scriptures, I always pray to the Almighty... ...to bless you with my remaining years, too. Don't you say such unpleasant things ever again! Please excuse me. Why is Tommy so silent today? What's wrong with him? It's because Reshma hasn't come today. Besides, I scolded him a lot today for disturbing me during prayers. He's angry with me, too. Hey! Where is he going? Went nowhere Reshma must have returned from the college. Reshma has returned? Tommy's nose is just like the secret services. He can smell it when Reshma is approaching. Please be seated. I'll fetch tea for you. You had better prepare some strong tea. I am very refreshed whenever I drink tea prepared by you. Tommy.. Tommy.. You were scared? You thought that" ...your brother had brought an Alsatian dog in the house, right? How could you scare me like this? How are your studies going? - I am doing quite well. But tell me, how come you remembered us after so many days? I knew that you too would complain about it like your mother did. It's a matter of a few days. I am changing my travel route for good. Henceforth I'll be driving the taxi only in Bombay. I will return home early Then I will have plenty of time to spend with you and mother. Stop quarreling. I have put water on the stove. Make tea for him. Just tea won't do. I won't let him go without sewing him food. I too won't go without eating the meals. Here's the file pertaining to the case. I cannot understand something. - What is that? Why did you decide to live in the same locality to track down the killer? That's because Niranjan's murder was committed by a truck driver. And in that locality, most of the residents are truck drivers. But how did you reach that locality? That's the modes operands of the police force. I befriended a man who drives a taxi. His name is Rahim. He hails from Allahabad. He is a noble person. Allahabad is his weakness. He can't bear to see a person from Allahabad suffering at any cost. I reached that locality by feigning helplessness. It's possible that he might be the murderer himself. I don't think so. He's not that kind of a person. But we need not rule out the possibilities. You have been summoned here for this special duty. You are the focus of attention in the entire police force. I know. I am trying my best. I might need some time. What are you searching for? This paper clipping. It might be useful to us. Is Rahim not at home? - No. I brought two cups of tea. - You may have one. Be seated. - No. You sit down. Shut up! In Allahabad, nobody drinks tea all by himself. Sit down quietly. You are a very good person. - ls it? How can you say that? If you were not a good human being, Rahim wouldn't have befriended you. What are the good qualities in Rahim? Not one.. He has several good qualities. He slogs all day long. But he never lets anybody affected by it. He is a very large-hearted human being. Whatever he earns, he spends it on the people in the neighbourhood. You are not even related to him. Yet he treats you like his brother. Do you know that he has even arranged for a taxi license for you? But he has only one weakness. - What's that? Neither does he let me play cards, nor allow me to pickpocket. Is this a weakness? Have the tea now. Who is it? Is your mother at home? Mother is not at home. But why do you want to meet her? Today is a sacred day. I thought... I want to touch her feet and seek her blessings. You know very well that mother goes to church at this hour. Hey! I'd actually forgotten that she might've gone to church. What's this? ls this meant for mother? No. This is a rice preparation from Delhi Darbar. Your mother might not be able to digest it. I brought it for you, my darling. Hey! What's this? In your eyes... - What happened? What are you doing? The door is open! I am an idiot. How could I not shut the door? Not at all. Till you don't marry me, you've no right to shut the door. My mother too wants to know when you would marry me. If I could help it, I would marry you rightaway. But I have to take care of some responsibilities too. Responsibilities? - Yes. I have a younger sister. I want to marry her off first. Sister? You have a sister too? Yes. I have a sister, and a mother too. But you never told me that you have your mother and sister too. There are several things which I have been wanting to tell you. Tell me now. I will tell you when the time is right. That's fine. But why didn't you introduce me to your mother and sister? They live in the village. I'll introduce them to you when they come. Where'd you go at this early hour? - I'd been to the temple. Have you cleaned the taxi? - I have cleaned your taxi. Rahim's can too will be cleaned shortly. Where did you go early in the morning? - You were sleeping. Since I am starting work on the taxi, I visited the temple. I have brought sweets for you. Eat it. I'll change my dress. That's wonderful! The sweets are delicious. Where did you buy it from? There's a shop outside the temple. Why don't you eat some too? These sweets are meant for you and Rosy. Save some for her, too. Rosy eats bread. She doesn't eat sweets. No excuses. Shut the lid, will you? Hey! What's this? Ex-MLA and Bombay's social worker Niranjan Seth murdered. The police is searching for a truck driver... ...who entered his home and murdered him. A lot of truck drivers live in our locality. Who knows... Only decent folks stay live. Are truck drivers supposed to be killers? Where is it mentioned? Look at the date. It's a six-month old newspaper. The killer mighfve been hanged to death by now. Why are you suddenly discussing murder today? Get ready soon. The neighbourhood folks must be waiting for us. When Rahim hands over the keys to Ram, you must clap together. Is that understood? - Yes. The taxi is shining so brightly. Come, Rosy" - Sweets. All glories to Lord Hanuman. Here, take the keys. May you prosper! Many taxi drivers these days think that... ...they are obliging the passengers by allowing them a ride in their cabs. You treated me so well. Your picture should be printed in the newspapers. People from Allahabad always treat others with respect. So you hail from Allahabad which is known for its guavas? Allahabad is also known for the Ganges Nehru and Indira Gandhi... ...and Harivanshrai Bachchan whose book 'Madhushalef you are reading. So you know about the 'Madhushalef, too?! Allahabad's people are a very well-informed lot. Now tell me...where do you want to go? So you study for your B.A. there? How did you guess that I am studying for B.A? When I did my graduation, 'Madhushalef used to be a textbook, there. You are a graduate too. You are a very wonderful person. It's the soil of Allahabad which is really wonderful. Even the guavas from Allahabad are so beautiful and attractive... ...that nobody would mind marrying them if they were girls. You are an interesting person. Since how long have you been driving the taxi? I have started this work today itself. This is my first cab and today is my first day at driving it. You are my first passenger. Since you are a graduate, why don't you take up another job? I'm a newcomer in Bombay. Instead of idling away my time, it's better to do some work. When I find a good job, I'll stop driving taxis. We have arrived at the college. I'll stop the taxi now. Here's your college. Where's my purse? I have not taken it. It must have fallen somewhere. Please search. I seem to have forgotten it at home. How'll I pay you the taxi fare? It doesn't matter. I will take it some other time. No, no...today is your first day at your job. I've spoiled your day. Please wait for a while. I will bring the money from someone. How much is it? 9 rupees, 7O paise. - Just a minute. Give me a tenner. I've forgotten my purse at home. And I've to give taxi fare. - Here you are. Hey! Where did he go? He didn't even take the money? You've returned too? I grossed 180 rupees and 6O paise today. You earned so much. I had only grossed 4O rupees the first day. I had grossed much more. But it's 9 rupees and 7O paise less. Why? You said that you are a honest person. How come you are cheating now? That's not the case. A girl had forgotten her purse today. You will find many such girls in Bombay who will con you. She didn't seem to be such a girl. She belonged to a decent family. Is it? Was she fair or dark? - She was fair. Was she beautiful? - Yes. What was her name? - I didn't ask her name. Didn't you ask her name? Yet you let go the money? I didn't leave the money. I just loaned it to her. She'll return. Where does she live? - I don't know. Did you give her your address? - No. Then she will surely return it to you. Kundan is drunk and is beating up his wife. He and his booze are a pain in the neck. Let's go. Give me money. - I don't have money. You've made life difficult for me. Get aside, you scoundrels. You're always bickering. - But I never complain. But your eyes always speak. Your eyes make allegations. I'll settle the matter for good. I'll kill you today. Aren't you ashamed of beating up your wife? Whenever I ask her for money, she's always cribbing. Shame on you. You are right. Shame on me. Hit me. I am a useless fellow. I don't have a job too. I cannot feed my wife and kids. I deserve to die. What's this? Have you gone crazy? Come to your senses. He's not to be blamed. Actually, he cannot see us starving. Neither can he fend for us. He only vents his frustrations on us. You don't have a job, do you? I'll arrange for a job for you. Till you don't get a job, I will pay for all your expenses. All right. Come on. Hey! It's you? The Lord would've provided me anything that I would've asked for. Is it? What did the Lord give you? He didn't give me anything, since I didn't ask for anything. By the way, I had been thinking about you. You must be wondering that your first passenger didn't even pay you. That's not the case, Madam. - My name is Reshma. My name is Ram. I couldn't catch the bus that day. I'm not a rich girl to be able to afford a taxi everyday. I'd returned with the fare money. Where did you disappear that day? I had found a passenger. I made a good beginning that day. I've been doing very well ever since. Here's your 9 Rupees and 7O paise. - No. Not at all. It's because I didn't take money that I am doing so well. Who knows, my business may suffer if I accept the money? You believe in such things? - Of course. We people from Allahabad believe in such things. We even believe that if our first customer has a cup of tea together.. ...our fortunes can undergo an overnight change. Is it? Where should we drink tea? Our favourite haunt is over there. It's about to begin raining soon. Let's hurry up. Wonderful! Make two cups of special tea. She's a special guest. Sure! "The rain-clouds..." "the rain-clouds..." "have mischief on their mind" "The way it's pouring this year..." "it isn't just water, it's sheer wine" "The rain-clouds..." "have mischief on their mind" "For our love to blossom..." "this is an incomparable season" "I said nothing, and yet..." "people in the world have heard it all" "I lost my heart to you..." "and chose my sweetheart" "I'm the one you dream of..." "just as you are the one I dream of" "the rain-clouds..." "have mischief on their mind" "There was something I was listening to. However..." "I'm not in my senses any more" "There was something I was saying too. However..." "I find myself silenced" "To every question in the world..." "this is perhaps the answer" "The rain-clouds..." "have mischief on their mind" "How shall I look at anyone in the eye?" "How shall I hide my feelings from the people in the world?" "Our faces say it all..." "our faces say it all..." "our faces are a give away" "The rain-clouds..." "have mischief on their mind" "The way it's pouring this year..." "it isn't just water, it's sheer wine" What are you thinking? The tea is getting cold. Why don't you watch when you drive? Will you always drive like this? He's always up to mischief. Why are getting angry at the taxi? Ram is acting very pricey these days. - Why? What happened? He passed by me dressed in a suit without bothering to look at me. He went away in a huge car. When? - Just a while ago. He's sitting in the house since quite some time. How can it be? - Why don't you take a look? Look! Isn't he sitting here? - What happened? You are here? Then who was he? - Who is that? He looked exactly like you. He passed by me in a huge car. I was waving out at him. But he refused to recognise me. I thought that you were the same person. If that person was me, then who am I? Looks like you have had a lot to drink today. I don't understand it. Did you have a look alike brother who separated from you during childhood? Separations happen only in movies, not in real life. Did you see 'Ram Aur Shyam', the movie? - Shut up! Why don't you arrange some liquor for me? So you got the hint, didn't you? He just needed an excuse to drink. I have a strange feeling today. Get me a couple of fried fish too. I was so upset today. I thought that my friend didn't recognise me. The fried-fish is arriving. You will be fine. She's inside. What does it contain? Don't give too much importance to the packing. I've brought a very good gift for you. Wear it quickly. We will "press" the mother. What did you say? - We will "press" the mother. Not "press". You should say "impress". - That's what I meant to say. Listen to me. Don't you drink too much of it. I get the picture now. You want to press mother, don't you? Why can't she understand the meaning of press? it's English, after all. Come, Rahim. Be seated. - No, you should sit. Please be seated. Here I sit. - Hold on! I have ordered it for you. - No, mother. I don't drink it. - It's God's preparation, you know. Is it? All right. Give me a little of it. - Give him a little. Here it is. Please hold it. Put it in my ear. I'll fetch some soda for you. - Please don't. It's believed that by putting soda, the hands begin to shake. It's fine like it is. It's such a nice dress. Won't you take me to dinner too? I didn't drink. Did I? - Not at all. Mummy said that I should take Rosy to dinner. Let's take mother along, too. - No. My days of going out for dinners are over. You go with Rahim. I'll remember your father in solitude. Please go ahead. "In fun, he sways..." "he's a carefree soul" "Stay away from him, folks..." "he's crazy about me" "In fun, she sways..." "she's surely a carefree soul" "Stay away from her, folks..." "she's crazy about me" "He fights with me every day..." "but I must say..." "whatever he is, he's incomparable..." "he's the one I dearly love" "I'm his flame..." "and he's my firefly" "Stay away from him, folks..." "he's crazy about me" "She sets my heart racing..." "she sets my body on fire" "Look at her gait..." "look at her tresses..." "is she a Japanese doll...?" "or she an Indian lass...?" "Stay away from her, folks..." "she's crazy about me" "In fun, he sways..." "he's surely a carefree soul" "Stay away from him, folks..." "for I'm the one he's crazy about" "She's the one I'm in love with..." "and yet, I'm scared of her" "He's the one I call my beloved..." "but I keep my distance from him" "There's no saying what he might do..." "he's out of his senses" "Stay away from him, folks..." "for I'm the one he's crazy about" "In fun, she sways..." "she's a carefree soul indeed" "Stay away from her, folks..." "she's crazy about me" Come Ram. How are you? I'm fine. Who's he? - Don't you recognise him? He's Ram, the one from Allahabad. So you live in Allahabad too? Where do you live? - It's a very tricky question. I cannot reply to you without having a sip. Why don't you drink too? - No, I don't drink. People from Allahabad don't booze. You are new in this profession. Once you get used to this profession, you will start drinking too. We've been drinking since 15 years, but the taste doesn't change at all. You didn't tell me where you hail from, and what's your name? I have forgotten my name by now. The number of my truck is my name now. Aweak battery...clutch brakes have been over-used... Whenever I remember my home, I feel so hurt. The trucks are our home now. We don't have any fixed place. Sometimes we even tend to forget the faces of our family members. We don't lead a normal life. At times, we don't meet our family members for months at a stretch. Look at this man... It's his son's birthday today. He didn't attend to his work. He was missing his child since morning and weeping. That's why we are all celebrating his son's birthday. Welcome. Why don't you drink too? You are a strange person. You guess the contents of a letter simply by looking at the envelope. This fellow is not a human being. He's a well. Thirsty people get attracted to him automatically. By the way, what are you doing here? I was chatting them up. Go and chat with people of your own community. They are truck drivers, while you are a taxi driver. You travel short distances, while they travel long-distance. Go away. Don't waste your time. This man from Allahabad is also like a closed envelope. I wonder to whom the letter within him addressed to. Please come. - So you've woken up? Do you know what condition you were in last night? Don't mention it. I had boozed a lot due to Christmas. What does it contain? - It has some dresses for you. For me? - Yes. And this has some dresses for Rosy. For me? What's the occasion? I have got a nice job. The salary is 2,500 rupees. 2,500 rupees? Didn't I tell you that he will get a very good job. I will visit the church today and light a candle. One candle will not be enough. You will have to light 2 candles. Why's that? - Because... ...the company has also provided me with a flat. It means that you will be leaving home. Yes. Why are you shocked? When are you going? - Tomorrow. So soon? - Since I will be leaving... ...what difference does it make when I leave? We have just started our friendship. You are talking of leaving already. I believed that I have found a younger brother. I thought I would share my grief and sorrows. Now my desires will remain confined to my heart. Hey! You are getting too emotional. You should be happy that your friend has found a good job and home. Tomorrow when he is married, and he begets children... ...wouldn't you want him to have his own home? Wouldn't you call us to your marriage? Why not? Moreover, I am not leaving town. I will keep in touch with you. You had better remember that... ...l will not let you leave my heart under any circumstance. Don't you spoil the mood now? Open the packet. Tell me...how do you find my presents? It's very nice. Your choice is very good. Who told you my size? He told me. - When did I tell you her size? Actually, every beautiful girl has the same size...36-24-36... I am making a move of 100 rupees. - I am packing. I stake 200 rupees. - 200 rupees? My money is over. This is the last 200 rupees. Show me the cards. - I have three same-colour cards. The two Queen's cheated me today. Where's the third Queen? Did it slip away? Deal a hand. - Fetch the money first. I'll get the money. - No arguments. Money first. Give me a 500 rupees. - No loans for gambling. Give me a 500 rupees. - I have lost money too. I have very less money too. - It doesn't matter. You deal the cards. Deal mine too. I will get the money right now. Come back soon. Why are you singing a farewell song? I am not leaving Bombay. I hope you will continue visiting us. - Don't listen to him at all. You are the first person who's leaving the filth of this locality. You need not return here. You had better forget about this place. You will be happier. I have a lot of sympathy with all of you. I have made this betel leaf with great love and affection. I will surely eat it. I will always remember you all and your love. Give me a betel leaf today. I will pay for it myself today. Let it be. You can pay me whenever you feel like it. When he dies and goes up to the heavens... ...Saigal, the late singer, will bash him up so much... ...that he will take another birth again. Where's Rosy? - I am right here. I wanted to see whether you remember me while leaving. How can I forget you? You and Rahim have made a permanent place in my heart. Where's Rahim? - He's standing over there. What's this? Why are you so sad? You should be happy! How can I be happy when you are leaving me? You are the first friend who has made a place in my heart. I am not leaving forever. I will keep in touch. Come on. What are you doing? - I am touching your feet... ...for having secured my future by arranging a job for me. I have arranged a job for him. After all, you had promised him. I should be leaving. I am getting delayed. Greetings, Rahim. Fill 10 liters. - You have come after many days. I rarely happen to come this way these days. Hey! This wallet belongs to Ram. How did I get it? Bahadur must have put it in my pocket by mistake last night. There must be money in his wallet. He's a senior Police Officer! Send the items found on the spot in the Niranjan murder case. You may go now. Is Rahim the killer of Niranjan? What is it? Here are the keys of your taxi. I am leaving your job now. - Why? You must be remembering that... ...my conscience had disturbed me the day when... ...l had embarked on the path of crime on your say-so. And today, I am realising once again that... ...l am getting more and more involved in crime. I am finding it difficult to breath too. I want to lead a good life now. Don't ask me the reason for leaving your job... ...for the simple reason that I won't tell you that. I will tell you the reason. The reason is Ram, your friend, who's a police officer. Aren't you shocked? I knew it since quite some time. If I wanted, I could've fixed him long ago. But I knew that he's a friend of Bahadur and Rahim. That's why I didn't take any action. I had even instructed my men that Ram shouldn't be harmed at all. But now that you are leaving, why should we I be concerned with Ram? It's possible that even before you reach your home... ...he might have been eliminated for good. Before you attempt anything, you had better remember that... ...l can kill and die for the sake of friendship. But I never suspected your capability. Perhaps we might not meet again. Before you leave, why don't you take away the gift... ...for your sister Reshma's marriage? It means that you were involved in that murder. It was your plan to blackmail me. You had better remember that... ...if I can murder once, I can murder again too. And if I kill again... ...it will be you whom I will kill. Where's your own taxi? You haven't replied to me? Where's your taxi? I have given up driving taxis now. Perhaps I might leave this locality too. But why? What's happened? Don't misunderstand me. Due to some developments, it wouldn't be wise for me to stay here. Nevertheless, I will continue to meet at regular intervals. Why are you talking in riddles? I feel that you are going through a great grief. Let me know. Perhaps you might feel light and relieved. Listen if you are so keen to know about it. I considered Ram to be my best friend. He lied to me that he's unemployed and has come here in search of a job. I doubt if he even hails from Allahabad. Then who is he? He's a top police officer who stayed with us under disguise. When he couldn't make any progress here... ...he slipped away from here saying that he has found a new job. What's wrong if he's a police officer? After all, he's still your friend. - Policemen don't value friendships. They sacrifice friendships for medals and fame. But Ram is not like you say. Perhaps he might have concealed his identity so that... ...he could reach out to some criminal through you. He will need to live for ages to make it possible. Welcome. I know that you must be angry at me. But then I was on duty. I had come here in search of a criminal. I didn't find the criminal. But I found a friend. And you continued to play with my emotions in the guise of friendship? How could you lie to me? You were the same person whom I saw outside the hotel that day. But you flatly refused that it was not you. Why did you have to cheat me? I wanted to keep duty and friendship on different levels. Friendship is a very personal matter. I have never befriended anybody in my lifetime, except for you. I am living for duty, and I can sacrifice my life for friendship. Please forgive me. I don't know what I blabber in my rage. Here's your wallet. Be seated. - Of course. Why have you kept that broken locket in your wallet? It's my late father's memento. I always keep it with me. Here's your wallet. What will you drink? Nothing. Where's Rosy? She was very worried about the developments. I will fetch her. Her dilemma will be solved too. Send this wallet to the laboratory, and get me the finger-print report. And match the report with the finger-print report... ...of the revolver found at the spot of crime. How long will the report take? - It will take at least a week. All right. You will have to take at least one ticket. Please buy one ticket, uncle. - Uncle? Never let me hear from a sweetheart that I am an aged person. At least buy a ticket from us. We won't let you go otherwise. How this change of image? You used to drive taxis earlier. Now you are travelling in a car? I happened to find a nice job. And this car? - I got it from the company. That's a nice development. Congratulations. What does yes-yes mean? Buy a couple of tickets from us. You will get to know everything. What are the tickets for? - For a charity show in our college. Who's organising the show? - Reshma and all of us. So it's you who's organising it? Tell me...can I get a ticket for the front seat? You can get it in the black market. I have understood that I have lost a 100 rupees. That old man has slipped away. Let's chase him. Thank God they've left. I was thinking of meeting you since the past few days. What for? - To ask for you your address. What for? - To meet your father. My father is no more. I only have an my elder brother. Okay. I will meet your elder brother. What for? - If I have to make progress... ...it's important to meet the elders in the girl's family. What for? - If I tell you frankly... ...you'd feel shy. - I won't feel shy. You won't feel shy? Can you bet on it? I want to discuss with your brother about my marriage with you. Didn't you feel shy? Now tell me your address. Brother lives elsewhere. He comes home sometimes. You had better come to the show. I will introduce him to you there. "His name is sweetheart "He asks for my heart" "What am I to do...? Oh, what?" "Stop bluffing. We know it all" "You've already given your heart to him" "So what are you asking us?" "Please believe me..." "Believe me, we happened to casually meet somewhere" "I didn't give my heart to him. He's the one who stole it from me" "Didn't you lose your heart to him?" "So you did nothing?" "So how does he become your sweetheart?" "His name itself is sweetheart" "How can I be blamed for that?" "What am I to do? Oh, what...?" "How our gaze met, I have no idea" "Whatever happened was against my will" "In God's name, I implore you" "Think of a way, please" "What am I to do? Oh, what...?" "Either forget about him..." "or turn unfaithful" "You'll forget about him and he'll forget you too" "Whatever happens, the one I've given my heart to..." "I'm going to forget about him, that's what I've decided" "You can never forget him" "Love is a disease that has no cure" "But we'll still pray for you" "His name is sweetheart" "He asks for my heart" Your performance was wonderful. Even the audience liked it. - How did you find it? Where's your brother? - He didn't come. Perhaps he might have been occupied elsewhere. I will escort you home. I will also get to meet your brother. No, not now. Let me discuss the matter with him first. I will introduce him to you later. I will leave now. We will meet later. Speaking. When? Tomorrow? All right. Because of Rahim's absence, we are facing lot of problems. Till now our small consignments have been confiscated. But tomorrow we will be receiving a big consignment. If Rahim is needed for that consignment, he will come. But I don't think he will come. Nothing is impossible. If I say that Rahim will come, he will surely come. I know how to make him come. Mother, Tommy is not to be seen. I hope he is fine. He's your darling. You should know. Are you going to the college? - You don't remember anything. Haven't you got the locket repaired as yet? That locket cannot be repaired. But I have ordered for another. You'd better leave for college now. Reshma will complete her graduation this year. Should we let her continue her studies? There's absolutely no need. Think of her marriage now. You had better look out for a suitable match for her. I have a boy in mind. But he... Brother... What happened? Somebody has killed Tommy. I found this letter tied to his belt. Perhaps you have forgotten that nobody can even breathe... ...if I don't desire it. Then why are you refusing to work for us? What's this misbehaviour? Why are you entering a cultured man's bedroom in this manner? Do you consider yourself to be a tiger by killing an innocent dog? It's just my way of conveying to you that... ...those who try to go beyond my reach meet with death. You seem to have forgotten Rahim. I cause death to those who try to block my path. I will eliminate you today... ...and destroy all evidence due to which you have been blackmailing me. Where are the negatives? Where are the negatives? Hand me the negatives, or else... - No! You need the negatives, don't you? I will give them to you. You had kept me on tenterhooks till today. But now I am a free man. If you ever try to even glance at my family members... ...l will kill you so brutally that even death would tremble with fear. I am severing all ties with you. We are neither friends, nor enemies. We were never friends. And you will get a taste of my enmity now. Calm down. If you cry, Tommy cannot be brought back to life. What harm did Tommy cause to anyone? I will ask Rahim to fetch you another dog. Calm down now. What a sweet dog it is. What's the name of this dog? I will go ask his father. Or his mother perhaps. How would I know its name? How about calling him Tommy Junior? No! Let's call him Junior instead. What? - Yes. He's a good brother. But he's not a good son. - Why do you say that? Can you not get me a daughter-in-law? Shall I call you a good boy or a bad boy? I am tired of listening the same tune... ...but you are still continuing with the same music. I want a sister-in-law for myself. - You want a sister-in-law? All right. I will take away the dog then. Do you want a dog or a sister-in-law? - I want both. You said that your sister and mother stay in the village. They stay in Bombay, but I have kept them under cover. I didn't want anyone to know that my mother and sister live here. Why? I had a big problem which I have removed today. What kind of a problem? - I will tell you later. I will introduce you to my sister and mother today. Mother Reshma... Please come. Brother. That's Reshmam and she's Rosy. I understand. - What did you understand? Brother has brought my future sister-in-law to meet us. You made us wait a lot. But now that you have brought her, she's a real beauty indeed. Mother, do you see brother acting shy? "From a faraway land, there will come someone..." "he will come and take me away" "His eyes will be the palanquin I will sit in..." "he will come and take me away" "All distances will be done away with..." "all helplessness will vanish" "He will take off all my glass bangles..." "he will make me wear thick gold bangles" "He'll come and take me away" "The one my love pines for..." "the one I have waited for..." "the ones for whom clouds have showered..." "he shall now quench the thirst of my heart" "He'll come and take me away" "My eves, my heart..." "have dreamt so many lovely dreams" "All the dreams I've had..." "he shall fulfill them all" "He'll come and take me away" "From a faraway land, there will come someone..." "he will come and take me away" The finger-print report is here. - What does it say? It says that the finger-prints on the revolver... ...and that on the wallet belong to the same person. Why did you do this, Rahim? Who killed him? Who killed him? I ask who killed him? Rahim killed him. He said that... Whose car is this? Ram has arrived. He waiting for you in Rosy's room. How are you, Ram? What's the matter? You are tense. Our friendship is being put to a severe test this time. What kind of a test? What's the matter? You complained to you that I never tell you anything about me. But I have a complaint against you. That you never treated me like your true friend. If you treated me like your friend... ...you wouldn't have hidden the serious incident in your life. How could you bear the burden of that incident all by yourself? Which incident are you talking about? Rahim knows what lam talking about! Perhaps he hasn't told you that he has killed an influential person. Whom did he murder? I had come here to investigate the same crime. I know that you are not a professional killer. But I don't know the circumstances which forced you to commit the crime. But a crime is a crime. You are an experienced police officer. You should know that there's a story behind every crime. I want to know that story. I will narrate you the story too. You may complete your duty now. I'm so unfortunate that I have been assigned the task of arresting you. You will arrest him?! The person with whom you shared food? The man who helped you when you were in great need? Simply because you hailed from Allahabad? Is this what people from Allahabad are all about? If you try to arrest Rahim, I will never pardon you. Let him perform his duty. Does he have no duty towards you or me? Ram is my friend, not my enemy. Whatever he is doing is right. Come on. Let's go. We will not let you take away Rahim. We will kill whoever tries to take away Rahim. Don't talk about killing or being killed. If either of them is killed, there will be violence... ...between Hindus and Muslims, and it might spread all over India. Let Rahim go. Or we will kill you. Beware! Don't you try to touch Ram. I am not allowing you to come anywhere near Ram. If you have the courage, lift the weapons and hit me. Why are you creating a mountain out of a mole-hill? It's not Ram who's taking me away. Rather, I am going with him. Let's go. Don't go. Don't worry. Your good wishes are with me. The wishes of the entire community is with me. Everything will be fine. What are you saying? What has my son done? The police says that he has murdered somebody. Murder? No! Mother. You take care of mother. I will go and meet my brother. I am not ready to believe that... ...a decent man like you could have killed somebody. You are concealing something from me. You were searching for a killer. You have found him now. What's the need of trying to dig into my painful past? Why don't you try to understand? Until you tell me the truth, how can I help you? By arresting you, I have done my duty towards my uniform. But now I want to do my bit for our friendship. Help me. You had told me that there's a story behind every crime. I want to know that story. For the sake of our friendship. You may please leave. Tell me now. I am not a born killer. I used to drive trucks to fend for myself and my family. I was very happy doing my job. I was living life quite peacefully alongwith my mother and sister. Suddenly, one day I realised that... ...my truck was being used for smuggling. I discovered that I'm carrying drugs to different parts of the country. The day I discovered the reality... ...l was livid and furious; I went straight to my company's office. Don't come inside. The bosses are quarelling among themselves. I didn't know that you would prove to be such a scoundrel. I started a transport company for you to help you out. I made you a partner without you having invested any money. But you...you never mended ways. You have swindled fifty lakhs from the company. You must have made some error in your accounting. I have made no mistake. Look at this...this is the auditor's report. I am giving you a week's time. If you don't repay the amount you owe to the company... ...you can very well guess how I will recover the money from you. Hey! You haven't left with the company truck as yet? What's this? - If I knew that... ...you indulge in smuggling in the guise of a transport company... ...l would've never worked for you. If these drugs were confiscated... ...the world would've labelled me as the smuggler. My mother and my sister swear by my honesty. I couldn't have shown my face to them. And the trucks which display religious lines carry these things? I won't work for your company henceforth. Stop. Listen to me too. Even as you are shocked to know that... ...drugs are being transported in the trucks... ...l am more shocked about it then you are. Actually, in your truck, goods of Niranjan Das' other companies... ...were being transported. But even I didn't know that it carried drugs. And nowl have understood why he started the transport company... ...in my name. So that if drugs were ever confiscated... ...it would be you and me who would be trapped in the clutches. Because I am the company owner. And you are the truck driver. But keep this information to yourself for the time being. I will speak to Niranjan Seth. All right. I have worked for you. I will keep quiet. But if any such act is repeated again, I will set the company on fire. Come in immediately. You called me, sir? Seth Niranjan Das has threatened us. And Rahim has learnt that we carry drugs in his trucks. That's bad news indeed. Because Rahim is a God-fearing human being. He will never tolerate it. And don't you treat Niranjan Das' threats as empty. He happens to be socialising with all the ministers. He can land you in trouble. Moreover, he is a respected social worker too. I know what kind of a social worker he is. He victimises new girls every night in the guise of social work. Niranjan Das' biggest weakness is women. And Rahim's biggest weakness is his sister. It means killing two birds with one stone. You know Rahim's home, don't you? - Yes. Yes? - ls this Rahim's home? - Yes. - Who are you? - I am his sister. Then you had better hurry up. He has met with an accident. What? Where is brother? - He is at the employer's bungalow. Mother is not at home, and... - Don't you worry. I will leave behind my driver. He will escort your mother. You had better hurry up. - Let's go. Sir, you followed me behind. What's the matter? It's bad news. I would have gone to the police station. But your family would have been humiliated. What's the matter? - Niranjan Das has learnt that... you came to my office. He has kidnapped your sister to silence you. I will kill him. Where can I find him? At his Juhu bungalow. Stop! He won't be alone there. Keep this with you for your own safety. Please let me go. I beg of you. I have been cheated into coming here. Now that you have come here, why don't you let me enjoy? I will make you happy. Help! Open the door! Darling...it's not my age to run around. Don't waste time, darling. Leave me. Leave me! Brother! Scoundrel! Brother! Calm down. Now that I have come, everything will be fine. You had better never mention to anyone what has happened today. Let's go. - How could you do this? I had given you the pistol only for self-defence. Not to murder Niranjan. I had no other option to protect my sister's virtue. You may hand me over to the police if you like. Don't say like this. In my opinion, you have not committed any crime. I would have done the same thing if I were in your place. When a dog turns mad, it should be killed. I can never forget your obligation all my life. If you hadn't informed me in time, my sister would've died by now. And I wouldn't have been able to face the society. Forget whatever has happened. Never believe that you have ever committed a murder. It will remain a secret between you, Reshma and I. I am your slave henceforth. If I can be of any use to you, I will consider myself fortunate. That won't be necessary. This company might have to be closed down now. Why would you have to close it down? I had borrowed nearly one crore rupees on Niranjan's guarantee. On hearing the news of his death, creditors will come and confront me. Even if I were to sell myself, I wouldn't be able to repay the sum. Such a large sum... I have some jewellery which belongs to Reshma. If you wish, I can fetch them for you. - Have you gone mad? I would prefer to die rather than sell her ornaments. I have only two options now. Either I can commit suicide, or... What else? Tell me. What's the other option? I've been told that drugs worth 2 to 3 crores are lying in the stores. If I sell those drugs, I might be able to save myself. But I have never done such a thing. And I don't know whom to trust and whom not to trust for this work. You can place your trust in me. I can do anything for you. I will deliver this consignment to its destination. You are obliging me with your favours. You had better stop driving trucks henceforth. I will buy you a taxi. You may continue to... ...deliver those goods in small lots to different destinations. As soon as my debt is repaid... ...l will dump the rest of the drugs in the ocean. The conditions under which you committed all these deeds... ...anybody else in your place would've done the same thing. But Ratan Seth is as guilty as you in this crime. So if you are to be punished for this crime... ...l wouldn't let him roam free too. Brother... What's happened? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. It would have been better if I had died. You had to face so much trouble because of me. I am the cause of your grief. You should have let me die. Why did you save me? You should have let me die? Why do you speak like this? It's you? - Yes... Unfortunately, it's me who has arrested Rahim. You are a police officer? But you were driving taxis? When I used to drive taxis, even then I was a policeman. So you lied to me all the while. And you arrested my noble brother today. Is it a crime if somebody saves his sister's virtue. No. Ram has done his duty. Is this the girl about whom you used to speak to me? Yes. But I didn't know that she's your sister. I used to dream about the two of you getting married. I am living to see that day. I am very happy today. My search has ended today. Once you and Reshma are married, I wouldn't mind even if I'm hanged. Don't speak like this. Nobody can separate you from me. If any harm comes to my brother... ...then humanity will be wiped out from the face of this earth. Nobody will be there to support an orphan like me. Orphan? Does it mean that Rahim is not your blood brother? I have never seen my blood-brother. I only know that every girl in the world... ...should have a brother like Rahim. I don't understand what you're saying. I'll explain it to you. Come with me. Look at this. You are shocked, aren't you? This is Rahim's house. This Hindu temple too is in Rahim's house. But the people from society cannot understand this basic thing. Even you couldn't guess that a Hindu Reshma is a Muslim Rahim's sister. Honestly speaking, I am not related to Rahim by blood. But then, blood relations are never true relations. What about your relationship with him? Relationships don't have a religion. Neither were you brought up on the Gita, nor was brother Rahim on the Koran. This temple too has been built by my Muslim brother. 15 years ago, I used to live with my parents in Fatima Manzil in Byculla. That year Bombay experienced a severe rainfall. Several houses came crashing down. The building where I lived crashed, too. My parents died in the crash. Even Rahim's father died in that accident. The woman who is my mother now saved me and brought me here. She waited for several months... ...hoping that somebody would come and take me away. Nobody came to take me. Everybody advised her that I should be admitted to an orphanage. But Rahim listened to no one. He made me his sister and let me stay here. I was only a four-year-old orphan then. I knew nothing besides my name. I didn't even know that I am a Hindu. Mother was once saying her prayers. I was standing near her and behaving like her. My brother told me that I shouldn't be doing that. When I told him that mother does the Muslim prayers... ...he said that mother is a Muslim. I asked him the meaning of being a Muslim. He said that mother is a Muslim and you are a Hindu. I asked him the meaning of Hindu. He couldn't reply to this question too. When I asked him who he was... ...he caressed my hair lovingly and said that he's my brother. I am proud of my friend. I swear on my friendship with him that I'll do my best to save him. He's a very simple person. Ratan exploited his simplicity and made him commit a murder. To save Rahim, Ratan Seth will have to exposed. All my godowns have been burnt down. I have suffered heavy losses. Several of my men have been detained by police. They can spill the beans any time under pressure. The man who's responsible for this is still alive. What can we do? He's still in police custody. He's in police custody! Not in hell. Go to the lock-up and eliminate him. And if you cannot do it, don't ever show your face. Understand? It's a brother's duty to safeguard his sister's virtue. And you hid this incident from me for such a long time? How could I tell you? Could you have lived if you knew about it? I didn't want to inform myself about it too... ...that a scoundrel tried to molest my sister. But don't you worry. My case is being fought by your younger son, Ram. How can I have any hopes from a son who arrested you? He's doing his duty. To hell with such duty which causes conflict between brothers. He's not only my brother. He's my brother-in-law too. What? Did you discuss anything about Reshma with Ram? Yes. You may go home now and make preparations for their marriage. Thank God! You had better leave this place quickly. Mother! Mother! Scoundrels! Run as far as you can. I won't spare you now. How did this happen? They killed my mother. They killed my mother. Who were they? Whoever they were, I won't spare them now. Brother! Take care of Reshma. No! Follow him. We can reach Ratan Seth through him. Are we going somewhere? No. Only I am going. Police has learnt everything about me. Strict checking is in progress within the city. But it's not so easy to catch me. Because I can slip away anywhere at any time. What's the use of my staying back? I will fetch my belongings too. You will not go anywhere. You are merely an extra luggage in this journey. I never travel with extra luggage. What happened? Who killed you? Where is that scoundrel? The boat hasn't reached yet? - It'll be here shortly. Take back the car. I hope everything is fine. - Yes. There's a phone from the bungalow. Rahim's escaped from police custody. He's heading in this direction. - Spread around the area. The moment you spot Rahim, shoot him dead. I have learnt everything. lam calling from the docks. Come over immediately. I have made all arrangements about Rahim. Come over soon. What happened about the boat? - The boat has arrived. It has arrived! You cannot save yourself from death. Slop! Don't! I won't let you take law into your own hands. Don't prevent me. He's the murderer of my mother. I won't let him live. - No! I am not prepared to accept punishment for the earlier murder. But I am prepared to be hanged till death for murdering him. I will ensure punishment for him for the earlier murder. Trust me. - Leave me. Run! Why did you do this? How could I let my sister's husband die? Now even if I were to die, I am not bothered. No harm will come to you. Call an ambulance quickly. What's happened to brother? How is he? Don't worry. He'll be fine. But where is he? What's happened to him? Where is he? I hear that he was hit with a bullet. He voluntarily became the target of the bullet which was fired at me. What? He's out of danger now. You can meet him now. Brother! You can complete your duty now. After killing Ratan, the objective of my life has been accomplished. I am prepared to go to jail now. How did you believe that you will have to go to jail? I am in-charge of this case. I have studied this case deeply. You have helped the law immensely. And law is never thankless. Is it possible? - Why not? That's what will happen. You go home. I will bring along Rahim with me. I can understand your urgency. - What urgency? Till I return from the jail, how can you be married to Reshma? Brother!
