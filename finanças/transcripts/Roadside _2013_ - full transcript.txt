I don't know why his ad didn't run. Just tell him I'll be back on the 26th and we can talk about it then. Fine, just tell him he can have the 32nd spot after the weather before the ball drops for half price. He'll love it. I gotta go. Merry Christmas. Remind me not to answer my phone when I'm on vacation. Don't answer your phone when you're on vacation. I guess, technically this doesn't constitute a vacation because a vacation is some place you actually want to go. Hey, come on. What did I tell you about barking in the car? Ugh, he smells horrible. Why couldn't we just leave the dog at home? Because, he's part of the family. Plus, the boys love him. He's staying outside. Are you serious right now? I am burning up. Well, it's freezing outside. But I'm hot. Why don't you take your sweater off? You'll be fine. Did we shut the garage? You're not gonna start this right now. No, no, no I'm serious. Did we shut the garage? Yes, we shut the garage. Did we set the alarm? Yes, the alarm is fine. It just feels off. Are you feeling sick right now? - I don't know. - Do you need me to pull over? No. How far are we? We're about an hour away. You should call her and let her know we're gonna be there. No, she knows. We're fine. Call her. Fine. Can I use your phone? Where's yours? I don't know, it's in the back somewhere. - She's not picking up. - Leave a message. Hey, it's your brother. Look, we're running a little behind, thanks to someone. But, yeah we should be there in about an hour or so-- Holy shit! What the... Fucking asshole. Just go around him. Can you believe this guy? What the hell is he doing? I don't know, but do something. Look out! Are you okay? Yeah. When's the next station? I don't know. It's hard to tell where we're at. We've driven this a thousand times. I think there's one up ahead. Oh, thank god. You need anything from inside? I'm good. I just need to stretch my legs. Watch the gas for me? Cold night out there, isn't it? Yeah, sure is. You wouldn't happen to know whose truck that is, would you? That'd be me. Come here, here you go. Awful fancy driving you did back there. You almost ran us off the road. You gotta learn how to drive. Listen, I don't want any problems. I know you don't. No, Buddy! I'm sorry. He's friendly, I swear. Come here, Buddy! Come here, Buddy! - Come on. - No problem. Cute dog. Come on, Buddy. Don't worry about him. They told me about him my first week on the job. What do you mean? He lost his wife and kid a while ago. Car accident. He's had a death wish ever since. You'd think that would make him a better driver. Well, I hope you got chains for that thing. Weather is not gonna get any friendlier. I think we'll be okay. Can I get you something from behind the counter before I shut down the store? Yeah, if you don't mind, can I get a pack of menthols? Wife don't want you smoking, eh? I told her I'd quit. Yeah, you should listen to her. You know women, they're always right. Well, I'll stop smoking when she stops stressing me out. I won't tell, I promise. You need a lighter with that? Matches, if you have 'em. All right. Here you go! Thanks. Hello there, miss! Can I interest you in a cup of decaf? I'm just getting ready to shut it down. Sure, thanks. Be right with you. That your white lab? Sure is. I have one just like it named Sonny. Ours is named Buddy. He's a real handful. Yeah, they always are. How old is he? He'll be seven in February. Did you put him up? No, he's running wild in the woods never to be seen again. Yes, I put him up. Here you go, miss. Thanks. You know, I just gotta ask. When's the baby due? I'm not pregnant. What... Oh, I... - I'm so sorry. - I'm kidding. Oh, oh! Thank... Thank God then. Yeah, we're still about four, five weeks. You know, you just about got me there, missy. Is it a boy or a girl? - It's a boy. - Ahh, a boy. He'll be just like his daddy. Yeah, well, hope not. You know, it's gonna get pretty nasty out there. I take it you two kids are prepared. As far as I know, yeah. You got four-wheel drive on that truck? Yes, sir. Perhaps, I could interest you in an emergency roadside kit. We have AAA. AAA, well, AAA don't get up here very often. You never know when it just might save your life. Sure, why not. All right, a kit, a gas, coffee and uh... Leave these off. I wasn't going to get those. Uh-huh. That'll be 75.76. Mr. Dan Summers, is it? Pleased to meet you, Dan Summers. You have a Merry Christmas there, Dan Summers. You too. Be safe, you two and congratulations on the baby. Thank you. Thanks. Seems you've made a new friend. Yeah, well, I'm a people person. Really? Like the man said, you never know when you'll need it. Wonder if this thing comes with a whistle and a compass. How you doing back there, Buddy? You told them we are leaving in the morning, right? God, I hope your sister doesn't make that awful ham again. I told them we'd leave after we ate tomorrow. I told my family, we'll be there at four. - What about my family? - They'll be okay. You know, it's not fair. What's not fair? It used to be we switch up on the holidays. Now, we just spend them with your family. Your father hates me anyway. No, he doesn't. Maybe he likes Erin. - What? - Erin? Think I haven't noticed? - Are you serious? - Yes, I am. Who is she? She's one of my assistants. How long has she been there? I don't know, a while. - Is she pretty? - No. - Don't lie to me. - I'm not! Great. How the hell did that get there? Must've fallen. Yeah, but it's dead. Looks like it was put there. I know. I know, Buddy. We'll be there in a little bit. I'm coming! I wouldn't do that if I were you. Who's there? Show yourself! I said I wouldn't do that. What is this, some kind of a joke? What is he doing? Come on, I'm not playing around. Neither am I. What are you doing out here? Waiting for you. What, you need a ride? What the hell? What was that? Mindy, stay in the car. Who's out there? Daniel, what's going on? Tell her to stay in the car. Mindy, get back in the car! What is this? Why the hell are you shooting at us? Hello? Listen, I'm gonna go back to my car and we're gonna leave. No one will ever know we were here. Get in the car and you'll die. Mindy! Mindy! Tell her not to move. Mindy, don't move from your seat. There's a man out here with a gun. What do you want from us? Who said I want anything? You must want something. Why else would you be doing this? Not necessarily. Do I know you? What's your name? Dan. I don't know any Dan. If we've done something to upset you, I apologize. Tell your wife to be careful while she's in the car. Mindy! Sit still. What do you expect me to do?! We'll be out of here in a minute. Don't lie to her, Dan. You know what, fuck you! Be nice, Dan. What have we done to you? This isn't about me. Yeah, but why us? Why not? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Yell, all you want. No one can hear you. Mindy! Mindy, honk the horn. What are you trying to gain from this? What do you have to lose? Listen, you don't have to do this. I know that. Then why not let us go? Your car is running. Leave when you like. Have you done this before? Tell me how long does this usually last? How long have you got? This is fucking ridiculous. What if I told you I was cop? What if I said I was? Are you? Maybe. Well, I am. So, you better let us go. No, you're not. How do you know? Look at you, you reek of fear. Fear? Fear? This is coming from a guy hidden in the woods? Who's too afraid to show himself? Fuck you! Tell me, tough guy. How many people have you killed with that gun of yours? Dan, stop! She's right, Dan. - Listen to her. - No. You know what, fuck you! You probably never even shot someone in your entire life! You pussy, you pussy! Am I right? Huh? Huh?! No! Dan! No! Hey, Mills, are you done yet? Camp sites are clear. Can't imagine anyone being out on a night like this. Yeah, they said it's supposed to get pretty bad. Did you check 16? Man, are you kidding? I came in an hour ago. I'm about two cups deep in Swiss Miss. Not a bad idea. Hey, it's a tough job. Somebody's got to do it though. Am I right? I hear you. I'm gonna go check 16 while I'm out. I'll join you after I'm done. Copy. Are you okay?! Don't move! Are you okay?! Yeah, I'm okay. Where are you shot?! Empty your pockets. All of them. The phone too. I don't have a phone. Don't lie to me, Dan. Throw it. Stomp on it. So, what do you really do? I'm a doctor. Really? What kind of doctor? A dentist. Too bad you won't be able to fix that hand then. Maybe I should have aimed for your mouth. Where were you going tonight? You know, we're going to be here a while. You might as well talk. How long is a while? That depends on you. We're going to my sister's for the holidays. Oh, how nice. Let me see your hand. Yeah. Ouch. That was our only phone. No, it's not. That was mine. I thought yours was in your bag. It wasn't. I dropped yours earlier, remember? It should be down there somewhere. How am I gonna find it? I can barely move my head without him noticing. Well, you have to try. I got a text out to someone though. - You did? - Mm-hmm. To who? I don't know. Someone got it. Are you sure it went through? Positive. Who's doing this to us? I don't know. Did he say what he wants? I don't think he wants anything. He must want something. He's not doing this for no reason. How much gas do you have left? It's a little over three quarters. Okay. Just keep the heat on, okay? And stay calm. I'm gonna get us out of this. Do you think someone will drive by soon? I hope so. Put this up. What is it that you want from us? Money? Is that what this is about? You really think this is about money, Dan? I think it can be. How much do you want? You don't have enough. Try me. A million dollars. Do you have a million dollars, Dan? I can get it. If this is about money, I can get it. This isn't about money. Is this about making a statement? Do you want press? Because my wife works for Channel 5 News. We can get you whatever spot you want. Do I seem like I want press? You may. Why don't you come out here and we could talk about it? Why don't you come in here? You can't really wanna do this. You gotta be as cold as I am right now. You haven't thought this through, have you? You don't know what you're doing. You really shouldn't try to bully a man that has a gun pointed directly at your wife's head. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You keep that pointed at me! You love your wife, don't you? What kind of a question is that? Who's Erin? How'd you know about Erin? The same way I know you might visit her when you get home. Is this about her? Did your wife know about Erin? I don't have to talk about this with you. You might as well. Look, it's Christmas. Can't you let us go? My wife, she's pregnant. Congratulations. That doesn't do it for you, huh? You still can't let us go. I'm not stopping you. You'll shoot me. Therein lies the mystery. Will I? I don't see why not. Try me. Buddy, ssshh! Shit. I must've really pissed you off. 911, what's your emergency? Yes, please help me. What's your emergency, ma'am? My husband and I are stuck on the side of the road. We're being held at gunpoint. Is the gunman there? Not near me. Okay, ma'am. Just stay calm. Where are you? We're on highway 16 nears Huntsville. Is the gunman outside the vehicle? Yes. He's got a gun to my husband's head. Is your husband in the driver's seat? No. He's outside. He doesn't know I have the phone-- Whoa, Mindy! Stay back Dan. Tell her to throw the phone outside. Mindy! Mindy, throw me the phone! Is everything okay, ma'am? Ma'am? Everything okay? Ma'am? Ma'am? Throw it. Are you there, ma'am? Hello, are you there? Ma'am? Ma'am? You missed. How many bullets do you have left? You gotta be running out by now. Why don't you find out? She got through to the police. They're gonna be coming. For your sake, you better hope not. Someone's coming. Someone's coming! What are you gonna do now? Mindy, someone's coming! Hey! Hey, over here! Hey! It looks like you're not that lucky Dan. Hey! Hey, Jim. I got an abandoned vehicle over here near 16. I'm gonna check it out. Copy. It's probably just a couple of kids screwing around. Be sure to take some pictures if it is. It looks empty. Give me a second. You're freezing. I could really use that cigarette right about now. Do you want some of my coffee? I'm fine. I'm sure that car will come back by again soon. We can't plan on that, Dan. I know we can't. We need to give it some more time not before it gets drastic. I know we can get out of this alive. You're gonna freeze to death. I'm fine. I could feel the heat. I don't wanna end up like some story on the 10:00 news. You're not. He's not doing this for no reason. I already offered him money. I told him we can put him in touch with whoever he wants. Can I help you? Yeah, is this your vehicle? It is. You know, this isn't a camping zone, right? I'm not camping. I'm just posted up the way. About to be some nasty weather tonight. What are you doing out here? I'm going to get you a blanket. Don't move. I don't care. Let him shoot me. Mindy, no. You hear that? Hear what? Yeah, exactly. I don't think he's watching us. Maybe he's waiting to see if we'll try anything. Yeah, well maybe... Hey! You still there? Dan, what are you doing? Dan, don't. Just a second. Dan! I'm still here. I'm okay, Mindy. You're braver than I thought. I can't imagine the life you live. All this free time to scare people. Am I scaring you? Yeah. Is that what you want, to scare me? Come on! Talk to me. You must wanna be heard. Why else would you be doing this? You tell me. I don't know. Problems at home? Money trouble during the holidays? Stress can make us do crazy things. We all get crazy sometimes, man but this isn't the way to handle it. You're right. I need help. I can get you that help. How do I know I can trust you? You can trust me. I promise. I don't need your help, Dan. I'm perfectly fine. Okay, we need to think of a way out of this. Hopefully, the police tracked the call. Who knows if they did? How long would it take them to get here? What about your text? I don't know. I mean it'll be a while before she figures out where we are. She? - Whoever it was. - Who is it? - I don't know. - Who is it? It was Erin. Mindy, it's not like that. - Mindy. - No. - You said it was nothing. - It is nothing. Okay, I promise Mindy. No. Don't make a sound. Hey, there dog. Cute dog. No! Hey, what's wrong? Mindy talk to me. What are you saying? It's Buddy! I'm so sorry. He's gonna kill us. Just do it! Whatever you're gonna do! Just do it! I'm waiting! Come on! Hey, Dan. You ready to talk some more? You know, she just sat there while I killed your dog. Will you shut up. Hey. Mindy, wake up. Can you turn the heater on? My hands are about to fall off. Hey, did you hear me? You'll be fine. What? I said you'll be fine. I heard what you said. - Hey. - Stop. Stop it! Dan, you're hurting me. I don't give a fuck! What, I'm not hurting? Huh? Look at my fucking hand? I'm not in pain. I'm the one standing out here in the freezing cold. You're the reason we're on the side of the road with the some lunatic. Me? What this is my fault? You wanted this. I didn't even want to be here. Yeah. You're so inconvenienced by this whole situation. I'm sorry I haven't been out here trying to get us the fuck out of it! Well, you're not doing a very good job. You look at lot on your because I think you seem to forget, the only thing standing between him and you is me. Don't do it, Dan. What if I do? I wouldn't. They're gonna stop. What do you want me to do? They're going to stop. Keep it together. This is gonna end this. They're gonna send for help. I'll end this right now if that's what you want. Keep it together. So, we've been worried about you two. We ran into some car trouble. We figured. Davina sent me to come looking for you guys once she got your message. Sounded like you hit something. Yeah, well, we're okay. I told her that but you know your sister. She's been worried sick. - Hi, Mindy. - Hi, Jeff. So, what exactly is the problem? We hit something. Yeah. Looks like it did a real number on your headlight and your mirror. So, what was it, a deer? I don't know. I didn't get a clean look at it. They like to move around in this cold. Jump right in front of you sometimes. Did it do any other kind of damage? No, no. Just right here. At the front there. Well, the truck seems to be running okay. Let me take a look under the hood. Hey, Mindy. Pop the hood for Jeff, honey. Well, everything seems to be in working order. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Okay. You guys wanna follow me out here. All right. Let's go home. What's wrong? What happened to your-- Dan?! What is it? The baby's coming. I can feel it. This isn't exactly the best time. I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm a horrible husband. No, no, I'm a terrible wife. I am. I know I am. I promise I'll be a better mother. You're gonna be a great mother. I swear. I never touched Erin. I've talked to her a few times. I'm guilty of the thought but I never touched her. I promise, okay? I believe you. Okay, we're gonna have this baby. Yes, we are. Not gonna have it here though. Hey, I promise. We're gonna have to move quickly. It won't be much long before we're out of gas. It's a little over a quarter. Okay. We need to find a distraction. Something we can use to get away. We don't have anything. There's gotta be something. All I have is this. Okay. Get that flare gun. What am I supposed to do with that? It's all we have. When I tell you to shoot, I want you to shoot it into the woods. I want you to shoot it where you think it'll have the most impact. Okay? You can't be scared now, okay? Now, you have to leave without me. He might shoot me. You have to promise me you won't let him catch you. You hear me? Okay. I love you. I love you too. Okay. Let's talk about a trade. What could you have that I want? I'll stay but you have to let her go. Why would you do that? She's about to have a baby. There isn't a hospital for miles. That's why she needs to go now. She'll never make it. It's a chance I'm willing to take but you have to promise, you let her leave. She's not leaving. And neither are you. Dan! Are you okay? It's the baby. What's wrong with the baby? I don't know. Something's wrong. Are you sure? We gotta get to a hospital. I know. I don't wanna lose our baby. We're not, okay? I promise we're not. Just stay calm. Stay calm. Are you okay? Something's wrong with the baby. You have to let us go. I'm afraid I can't do that. I'm not asking you I'm telling you! We're not staying here any longer. It's a boy. Yeah, we're still about four or five weeks. He'll be just like his daddy. Yeah, well, hope not. Dan, no! Come on! Where are you? What happened?! I got him. What are you doing?! I wanna see his face. What is it? About to be some nasty weather today. What are you doing out here? Sir, put the light down please. Sir, stay where you are. It can't be. Did you really think it would be that easy? Come on out! Come on, don't be afraid. Right now, let's go. Come on. Just you and me. Mindy. Yeah? Remember what I told you earlier about waiting for my signal? Yes? Get ready! Don't be a hero, Dan. Just doing what I have to. Stay with me baby. Stay with me. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. All right, stay calm baby. Are we safe? I think so. I can't see him. We're gonna get to a phone. We're gonna call the cops. We're gonna get you in a hospital, okay? Dammit! What is it? We're almost out of gas. Okay, we're gonna be okay. We're gonna have to walk. I don't think I can make it. You're gonna have to. Okay, okay. Hold onto me, okay? I don't think I can make it. Okay, okay, let's walk. Easy, easy. I'll hold you, I'll hold you. Okay. Someone's coming. Someone's coming. Hey! Hey! What are you two kids doing out here? - Holy shit, it's you! - What happened? Look, it's a long story. Please, can you take us to a hospital? She needs to see a doctor. Of course! Come on, get in. Easy, easy. Okay. I can't thank you enough for stopping. No problem, Dan.
