THE HATER Thank you for meeting me. I wanted to have this conversation to straighten things out. As I see it, what I did shouldn't be classed as plagiarism. The dean is waiting, let's go. Just because there are parts of the essay without quotation marks... After all, if I wanted to commit plagiarism, I would at least try and hide it somehow, right? I wouldn't do it so openly. Plagiarism is not a matter of interpretation. I understand it can be perceived that way but... It's not a matter of perception. I feel that I've been treated extremely harshly, unjustly. Do you think you were treated worse than other students? You said that, Professor, not me. Let me put it this way, no matter if you wrote the work yourself, or you didn't learn the material and just asked someone to write it for you, plagiarism is plagiarism. I can answer that even now, I learned all the material from the year. It was possible to pass the class by taking an oral exam in summer. You chose not to. Unfortunately, I couldn't as I was slaving away on two shifts to be able to pay for this school somehow. Tomasz, there is a Latin saying: "Verba volant, scripta manent" - words fly away, writings remain. I'm begging you. Please don't do this to me. At the Faculty of Law, you broke the law. I really can't help you. Removal from the list of students is final. In that case, Professor, could I ask for a dedication? Your book changed my perception of law. And thank you for the whole year. You're a great inspiration to me. ...to the enemies of the homeland! Death to the enemies of the homeland! Death to the enemies of the homeland! Death to the enemies of the homeland! The boy has been trying to visit us for a year, you see? For a year! He calls us, writes emails, text messages, he obviously cares. - What message are you sending him? - Don't exaggerate, please. I'd be there if it wasn't for the Death Eaters. Who? White Europe or No Europe. I've seen it. Dreadful. Alright, fine. We'll start without you but hurry up, please. Fuck. Aaah! For fuck's sake. Hey! Hi. Tomek, wow. You've really changed. You haven't. I mean, you have, but... you have the same face. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry I'm late, the morons have blocked the whole city. Don't say that. You shouldn't say such things about others. Hard to believe that in the 21st century fascists would come out on the streets. Load of fuckheads. Robert. Tomek said that a lot has changed in Wilkowyz, Gabi, you know? They closed down the stable, started a farm. - Oh my! - Yes. But the bees remained? Yeah well, about the bees... it was a tourist attraction. Once the people stopped coming, my father and I... had to sell them. You know, Tomek, we... we really wanted to keep visiting - but there was always something... - Of course. - We couldn't. - I understand. We had great summer vacations there. You didn't come and visit, so I came to you instead. You know what? Call us by our names, Robert and Zosia. What about "uncle" and "auntie", like in the old days? "Uncle" and "auntie"? Sure, why not? It's very good. Did you cook it, auntie? Mm-hmm. Come on! This is my recipe. I make it. - Delicious! - If I have the time, that is. They're pissing me off. Listen to them scoffing. What a horrible pair. Well, I don't want to outstay my welcome. Uncle, auntie... Your help is very important to me. Come on, Tomek, don't go yet. Tell us, how is school? The first year was difficult. Very difficult. But the second year is much easier. I even got a dedication from Professor Hoff-Studnicka. Oh! The one from the news, the human rights specialist? Nice. And where do you live? In a dorm. But it's far away? - As long as I can get there. - Tomek, we're really proud of you. Well done. Do you know that you'll be studying together? Gabi had a gap year but now she's back. Right, art history. Oh, you've already talked? No, we have mutual friends. Anyway, I've got something for you. Thanks a lot, Tomek. Jam! Strawberry. Strawberry. I love it. - Can't you stay a bit longer? - I don't want to impose. - I'll walk you out. - It's so nice. Thank you. It was really good, auntie. Take care. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Bye. Thanks for visiting. Not hungry after what happened yesterday? Just let it go, ok? - Did you sleep at all? - I slept, "Auntie". It was creepy, wasn't it? - Was it? - Don't exaggerate. How did he know about my course? Did you sleep at all? I slept, "Auntie". It was creepy, wasn't it? - Was it? - Don't exaggerate. How did he know about my course? He said you have mutual friends. Mutual friends my ass! He must have googled me. Urgh, it's creepy. I wonder what really happened to those bees? What do you think? They poisoned them. What are you saying? Beekeepers don't poison bees. - Mom, they did much worse things than that. - Still, you can't deny the boy is ambitious. Can you imagine? He's from the middle of nowhere and he managed to get into law school. Good for him! Speaking of which, did you submit the papers? I did. - Really? For sure? - Please, mom, not today. Oksana, do you want some jam? Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Quiet. And what? She likes it. He was so nicely dressed though. And did you smell his cologne? His cologne is one thing, but did you see him struggle with that shrimp? I did. The poor boy ate the tail. Crunchy. Have you ever been to his dorm? Why the fuck would I? I know exactly what it's like. Sweaty men, instant soup and a long line to the john. Hi. - Didn't see you on the march. - I was somewhere in the back. Robert, how much "scholarship" money are we giving him? Five hundred a month. Maybe we should give more? I don't want him dependent on us. No, come on. He isn't like that. He has his pride. That's true. He didn't come here to beg. Why did he come here then? What? Shut up! He was staring at you so much. Urgh. Stop it, dad. Who's that? Go and open it. - Tomek. - So sorry to bother you. Tommy. Tommy, how nice to see you. After so many years. I think I left my phone. Oh. Here it is. Well then... Again, thank you very much. Bye. So? See you at the university? Sure. And add me to your friends. Sure, send me a friend request. I already did. Seven years ago. I'll accept it then. It was good to see you, Gabi. - Bye. - Bye. What were you listening to? A stand-up. Not very funny probably? It was funny. I wonder who'll be my roomie now? - Don't remind me about that. - Hi. - Did you forget? - Did you see on Facebook... - Oh, thanks. - ...about that Silent Disco event? Silent Disco? - No. - Shall we go? I just invited you. Where's it going to be? - Some graphics studio. - This Friday. Mm-hmm. - Show me. - Mikolaj will be there, so I'm out. That's precisely why you should go. Looking great, with us. - Exactly. You have to go. - We'll dance a bit... - I can't go. I'm flying off, to school. - Ah... What are you studying? Fashion Design. Cool. And you? Same, but in London. He's at New York. - Congratulations. - Jesus, my landlady texts me non-stop. I need to find someone for my place. I'll take it. You know, I'm looking for a flat. You are? Let's say I'm fed up with the smell of instant soup - and waiting in line for a shower. - I don't have any photos on here... - but you can call me and I'll show you. - Sure. But Tommy, it costs... I don't know... Two thousand? Gabi, it's the city center! Twenty-two hundred is not that much. A real steal. Exactly, although it is tiny. Whatever, I'm barely home anyway. I'm either working or studying, so... Where do you work? I have an internship at this cool agency but this week I planned to... I have a couple of job interviews. I'm excited, it'll be... We'll see. Can I have a light again? What have you got there? A kid? Wait. Nice. Did you get paid already? No, I didn't. And you? Nothing. I think that's it. Nice. Great apartment. So, twenty-two hundred? Exactly. Paid at the end of the month? Can't it be now? After the weekend? - Or I can give you half now and... - No, I'd rather have it all at once. - Just make sure it's after the weekend. - Maria? Listen, let's add each other as friends, it'll make contact easier. Okay. So you're Tomek... Oh, don't worry, I've already got you. Ok. Thanks. Hello? Good morning, this is Tomasz Giemza. Two weeks ago I sent you my CV and I'd like to know how things stand now. Yes, I'm moderating now but I think I'd be great at content marketing. I see. No, it's okay. Have a nice day. Goodbye. Good morning, this is Tomasz Giemza. Sir, I sent your company my CV about a month ago and I just wanted to ask... I see. Not at all. Naturally. Have a nice day, goodbye! Hi, this is Tomek. Remember me? Hi, what's up? - So he didn't get it? - Completely clueless. That's me, and this is my "plus one". Okay, come in. Gotta take a leak so I'll find you later. - On the dance floor, right? - Sure! Hi! What are you doing here? I came with my friends. How is it? What about your work? Oh, great! - It's too loud in here, we'll talk later. - You look great! Take it away from me. So what about your work? Tommy, we'll dance again later. Oh, sure. Are you joking? And what should I tell the client exactly? That poor little Rafal didn't develop the strategy because he "had no flow"? No! Listen! There is no tomorrow! You'll get it done, don't be such a fucking millennial. I can show you how a millennial can do it. Tomasz Giemza. I'm studying law and I'm an intern moderating social media, but neither gives me satisfaction so I'm looking for new challenges. - Beata Santorska. - I know who you are. I wanted to send my CV... - May I have my coat? ...but you're not recruiting. When do you need this presentation? For yesterday. Tomorrow morning? - I can do it for free, but if you like it... - Mail. I'll send you the brief. You're beautiful. I love you. FitAneta Fit Celebrity Goals: Loss of popularity among social media users. Reduced public profile. Reduced public profile. Good morning, Eco-maniacs! Girls, today it's butt exercises! Feel the burn? Good! - Thumbs up! - Exactly, thumbs up! Hate really bothers me. I can't say I ignore it because I don't. Anyway, lately... Today I'm presenting my new juice diet, which is one hundred percent... I love it. You can taste the turmeric. Healthy. All these juices contain turmeric. See you next time! Attack is the best form of defense. I mean, if our client suffers due to FitAneta's accusations, why shouldn't we do the same to her? We set up profiles on social media platforms and medical forums. Then we say that FitAneta's detox is actually harmful. We fabricate people's stories and simulate an avalanche reaction. Rafal came up with the same thing. Hashtag "turnedyellow". The concentration of turmeric in the detox exceeds the beta-carotene norm several times. We'll bombard FitAneta with photos of yellow hands, as well as some bloody diarrhea, people fainting, leaching of minerals from the body. Okay, but is this in line with the law on unfair competition? From what I know, and I should, since I study law, we'll still sign an NDA with the client. Don't you think real marketing shouldn't exceed ethical limits? If I were interested in "real marketing", then I'd go to a real PR agency, like the one you were fired from. Give us a moment. - I'm sorry, I didn't... - Get out. Emotions, emotions. - He seemed so promising, didn't he? - You've got a trial month. Finally I know what work it is. Congrats! Thanks, I'm happy. Thank you for yesterday. No problem. Do you remember what you said in the cab? ffs I'm sorry for the state I was in. It's fine, you owe me a party. Nothing happening in the city now. Doesn't have to be in the city.:) Do you remember my sister Natalia? We're throwing a birthday party for her. Want to drop by? Disaster - antidiet #turnedyellow Pseudo-expert! #turnedyellow Scam! #turnedyellow - You're not done yet? - Just some small corrections. Do you have too much time? I think you do. Show me the reach of this... Turnedyellow? Ask the Indian for more fake accounts. What Indian? Did you think we get them from Europe? Make the specifications - age, sex, ID. I'll cut her throat. What did you do again? Get up. Don't stand over my shoulder, go away. You, Yellow Hand! Check this guy out for me. Rudnicki Great City, Great Future - I didn't know we were playing politics. - Fuck me, listen to this guy. He comes to the big city, rides the subway twice and now he's playing politics. - Find his weak points. - Can I finish this first? Finish it later, now do this. Very well. People tend to hate a lot when I have a politician on my show. This time, I'm curious myself. [P. Rudnicki - candidate for Warsaw mayor] I'm glad to hear it... Should Warsaw open up to refugees? I think it's open enough already. We have 120,000 immigrants from Asia. Of course, security is a priority but we can't be xenophobes. Let's address the elephant in the room. You have an account on a gay social platform? Oh yes, my alleged gay profile. This is the level of the absurd only seen in politics. I can't keep up with all these fake news stories... Candidate for mayor of Warsaw on behalf of Union for the Future. Found anything? No. I don't know what the boss sees in you. Yellow hand, fuck me. You're still here? Indian squaw. Where's your wigwam, Pocahontas? Go and cry in the bathroom. Some people are made to be kicked. Nice friends you've got. Uh-huh. What about that guy by the door? That's Stasiek Rydel. He works at mom's foundation. Awesome guy. He's preparing an amazing exhibition - "Neuropea". He also had an internship at MoMA. You've heard of it, right? Momma? Sure. Recognize this? Where did you get it?! Tommy gave it to Natalia as a gift. - Great present. - Thank you. So, Tommy, how are you handling college and work? I manage, somehow. If you were less busy, I'd ask you for help with one thing. - The exhibition? - No, no. The exhibition will be later. We're doing a charity auction and we're short of volunteers. I'd be happy to help! Great. Zosia, I think this is the moment. Gabi, come on. Your father wants a word. Dear friends! We are gathered here to celebrate the birthday of our beloved Natalia. These are difficult times, dark clouds are accumulating above Europe. Tribalism, nationalism, authoritarianism, they threaten the fundamental values on which our world is built. That's why I hope that you, dear Natalia, keep doing what you do. To use your enormous potential, and education from the University of Oxford, in the fight for a better tomorrow. Such a daughter is the greatest gift a parent can get. Gabi is also with us. She's a very talented and sensitive soul. She's sure to surprise us all one day. So have fun, eat. We have vegetarian and gluten-free. I can't see. Can you shine some light here? Ok. Truth or dare? Truth. What was this gap year all about? You didn't upload any pics. What the fuck? You were stalking me on my profile? Depression. Medicine. Therapy. Because of all this shit I didn't get anywhere. Not to Cambridge, nor to UCL. You'll go somewhere anyway. No. The world is your oyster. I know I won't go anywhere. Ok, fuck! For fuck's sake! Bleh. What is it? It's sour! Truth or dare? Dare, obviously. No. Truth. - I can see you're hiding something. - Me? We were supposed to tell each other everything. You can't tell anyone. - Promise? - Yes, I promise! Speak. I committed plagiarism. In an essay. That's it? They kicked me out of college. What? When? I really wanted to tell you. I'll return the money your parents gave me, but... I don't have... Why are you two hiding in here? Just chatting. - We're waiting with the cake. - We're coming, uncle. Oops. I never thought it'd come to this. But in the face of all this news, punishable threats, I'm forced to suspend my activity. - This wave of hate that I'm getting... - Wave of hate? Poor thing. So many people have turned their backs on me. I'd taste those tears. Show me some comments. I can't deal with it. I'm a person too. Real stuff. The power of suggestion. You got lucky. You've earned a bonus. Kamil will train you on the equipment on Monday. Micro cameras, wiretaps, keyloggers... Wiretapping? Remember to ask Kamil for permission. Kamil, you've got competition. Try not to destroy the desk with your boner. Hey Gabi, how are you? Ok? Hello hello:-) Wanna meet? Did something happen? Reply, please. Yes? - Oh. - Hi Staszek. Oh, hi. You look very elegant, Maciek. - Tomek. - Tomek. Of course, sorry. - If you want, I can get you a marker. - No need. - Are the Krasuckis here? - They'll come for the auction. Good evening. - Oh, good evening. - Can I have a second, please? Excuse us. Is Gabi coming? No, she doesn't feel well. Something serious? She doesn't reply to my texts. Are you surprised? You put her in a very difficult position. And you treated us unacceptably. - I wanted to wait for the... - Excuse me. - Zosia, don't forget the panel. - I won't. Let's go. I'll return the money, I swear. - It's not about the money. - I'll return it anyway. Can you come for a second? Sorry, I was talking to Tomek. People are waiting, get a grip. Welcome to the "Big Hearts" foundation charity auction... I'm sorry. ...in aid of the victims of war in the Middle East. - We don't usually invite politicians... - Here you are. - And for you? - ...but today's guest is an exception. A scholar, an outstanding economist, a friend, and last but not least, the last hope for our city. Pawel Rudnicki! After such an introduction, whatever I say is bound to be a disappointment. The red? Good morning, Oksana. Tomasz Giemza, I'm a friend... Oh yes, Tommy. But the Krasuckis are not at home right now. I know, I just talked to Gabi on the phone. She asked me to drop a couple of things off in her room. Well, if Gabi asked, then I guess... Thank you. Getting ready for Christmas? Just a few decorations. Then don't worry, I'll manage. Very well. What was Oksana thinking, letting a stranger into the house! We need to talk to her. What a fucking... There's a letter. Money. He returned it with some extra. - This isn't about the money. - I know it's not. It's illegal, it's sick! Okay, that's it! Oh, Christ. What did he write? I can't read this. With all these memories... Poor boy. A potential psychiatric patient. He's asking for a meeting. He wants to straighten it all out. You're not going, are you? Gabi, please, he's a pathological liar! He'll latch onto you and never let go. He's disturbed! It runs in the family. He's a bad influence on you. I saw you two doing drugs. Dad's right, you can't let him use you like that. - Of course. - You've just started therapy. - Yeah, sure. - You've stopped partying... I can't believe it. Let's not waste time on him. Exactly. Hey, Pawel will be on TV. Oh, put it on. ...our reporter also visited the office of Pawel Rudnicki, the Union for the Future candidate for mayor of Warsaw. Pawel Rudnicki likes to surprise us with his speeches in the media. This time, however, he has really outdone himself. A Warsaw for the future, but also for all animals: dogs, kittens, squirrels, hedgehogs, wild boars, ants. All animals are welcome. Hallelujah and onwards! - We can do it because... - If we can't, then who can? "Hallelujah and onwards"? Who the hell came up with those lines? Fucking ants? Squirrels? For fuck's sake, I'll kill myself if he loses this election. Rudnicki Great City, Great Future - Morning. - Morning. Apparently there were some problems with the router? Were there? Maybe Monika knows. Monika, someone came about the router! Okay, follow me. The capacitor is defective. I'll replace it free of charge. Can I leave you alone with that? Well, I'll be here a while. No problem. Scandal in Pawel Rudnicki's team at the very beginning of the campaign. Hundreds of favorable comments that appeared last Friday had the IP address from the office of the Union for the Future candidate. It seems that the candidate got his team to praise him online. Bye. I hope our next Christmas wishes will be in the City Hall. Enthusiastic comments were written from newly created accounts and posted under articles about the upcoming elections. When confronted, Pawel Rudnicki was unable to give a definitive answer. Over two hundred comments in an hour? A private initiative? We have three months until the elections and you'd rather focus on trivialities, no offense. Rudnicki's party authorities considered the whole case a provocation, though they admit that all attempts to censor the Internet can seriously harm public debate and be in conflict with freedom of expression. What's next? I want to continue. No way. Yes way. He's taking over. Don't argue. Brief him. - We need a new NDA. - I already have one. A new one. This is politics. Do we know who the client is? Your old lady. Beata, here you go. I ordered eighty fakes from the Indian, mainly young blood. Twenty, twenty-five. Facebook, Twitter. I made some test memes about Rudnicki. - divorce, darkies - they went viral fast. So I went one step further and started a Fan Page: Stop Islamization. I made the mix, mobilized the dummies, then it reached the 'normals'. It worked beautifully. [Poland for whites] Most admins are my little fellowship of the ring. We have the mix, now we put it all together. Say he wants to bring darkies to the capital. But not too much, so they can't tell whether it's fake or not. And for fuck's sake, keep it simple. Play on the emotions. And don't let Zuckerberg block you. - It has to be strong, but within the rules. - Okay, sign it. Same as before, only the penalty is different. "800 thousand zlotys"? Do you intend to "disclose confidential data"? No, but from a legal point of view... Don't fucking talk to me about the law. 3 months ago, they kicked you out for plagiarism. Why did he get caught up in this? What a moron. Rudnicki. He should have said that it's a provocation and left it at that. Not this bullshit on TV. What a shitshow. Oh, Gabi. Tell us, how was your date? Because Staszek looked delighted. Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Fucking great. All we need now is a slogan. "Rudnicki wants..." "Rudnicki invites them to Europe"? No. Or something simpler. "Rudnicki wants THEM in the capital! Do you?" That's pretty good. Not sure about that "Do you?" part, but... Keep thinking. Nice. Rudnicki invites... Soon on our streets. ...he said he fired... fired the whole hospital. I remember now. Rudnicki's program for Warsaw. Rudnicki: Great City For Islam The price for a good kebab. Your future neighbors, family and friends. Here! Thank you. Thank you very much. You took the bugs, right? What for? For Rudnicki. You know that taking such equipment outside is a huge risk. Not only yours, but mine and the client's as well. You have to think strategically. Do you have anyone who can help you? What do you mean? Do you know this man? Sun Tzu? "The Art of War"? Mean anything? No. Ok then. Audiobook from the conference. Sun Tzu calls such a person a "lost agent". Someone you sell false information to. You don't tell him who you are, you work with him, you use him for manipulation and provocation. Of course, everything within safety limits. There's no better textbook for people in our business. Chapter One. The commander must be impenetrable, disciplined and menacing. So that his officers and soldiers respect him and also to prevent the enemy from seeing through his tactics. The enemy must be manipulated and led into despair before he executes his plans. Double agents are the enemy's spies who work for us and are expendable. They spread misinformation in enemy territory. If the secrecy of the mission is compromised, the spy needs to be killed, along with all the others to whom he gave the information. - Suddenly found the time? - Don't close it. Dude, what can I tell you? I really didn't have time. Is it so hard to write back? Sorry, I should have replied, but what about now? Why did you come here? I've never held a gun in my hands, and you know what these times are like. Come on, help me out. I have money. Patryk. - Are you busy? - Clearly. You've got a new student. Hi. Come on. - Fucking awesome! - Reload! - The magazine. - It's jammed. Show me. Chinese shit, fuck. It's fucked up for good. We need to swap it. So what? The Netherlands is fucking awesome. I'll save some money and come back to Poland. What are you going to do there? Cut the flowers? I pay my fucking taxes in Poland! - Fucking Polish taxes! - Alright! Paying your fucking taxes. Oh, look. That's the politician, Rudnicki. That's all we need, another faggot. And what would you do to him, wise guy? What do you think? Where's the fucking remote? Mr. Kazio? The remote! Shut the fuck up! I'd headshot the motherfucker. - For real? - What? No, dude, come on. - And then a blowjob. - Fuck. Finally, the man for the job. Mr. Kazio saved us from that left-wing cock. Bravo! Listen, we may have CCTV from the 90s but Mr. Kazio is irreplaceable. He's a retired electrician, you know. He's got no family, so he has to earn money somehow. Oh fuck! Guzek! - Let's go somewhere else. - Nah, I have to go home. Who is he? - Some fuckface. - A creep. - Clingy as fuck, hard to get rid of. - Nah, he's a regular guy. A little unstuck. What do you mean? He's trying to go viral. Do you remember how he stacked explosives in his basement? - Yeah. - What the fuck? It even went to court, but then it got dismissed. What a nutjob! Now he just plays this MMO 24/7. All the time. Got to hand him one thing though - he's really good with guns. Hey guys, you're probably wondering why I look so odd. The headphones and glasses are necessary for shooting. Bam, bam, bam. As you see, with a few basic moves we can kill a large creature like that. Of course, if I had a lightning bolt of revenge, I could have... Shame on the vermin plague! Our civilization's collapsing! Today we're dealing with an invasion, a planned, organized invasion. They want to bury the old Christian continent. We need great people, great deeds. Why a Kalashnikov? Let me tell you. The magazine is easy to insert. There's a hook here, reload. We have an invasion to prevent. And it's coming soon so we have to get ready. I'm calling on you to mobilize yourselves. If you liked the video, give it a thumbs-up. And remember, be ready. Ruse 31 Distract the enemy by luring him with the charms and beauty of other people. Send them as your agents to wrap the enemy's ruler around their little finger. Attach flowers to the dried-out tree. This metaphor is synonymous with giving the impression... What are you doing?! Are you kidding? Just doing research. Rudnicki's poll numbers are up after the convention. Have you got anything from the wiretaps? The client is pissed. Pull yourself together. Let's try to set it up now. We'll put it a little higher. We'll try and hook it... wait, what did it look like? Let's try to hook it here... ...where the water... - Hi Staszek. - Hi. - Where can I find...? - You're here to see Zosia? First go straight and then right. - Sorry, I have to set this up. - No problem. I wanted to apologize from the bottom of my heart. I know that I really let you down. Sincerely, thank you for everything you've done for me so far. I don't deserve it. Fine. Anything else? I'd like to help. - Help? - With the exhibition. Could I become a volunteer? I hope you'll agree. I can even become a living sculpture. Even if I agreed, it would be only under one condition. That you won't use this to get to Gabi. - Yes, of course. - I'll let you know. We know who you are, Guzek. "Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri" Why me? We've been watching you for a long time, Guzek. Following your social media. We like your vlog, your ideas. We also really admire your shooting skills. Well, you have to be ready for anything, right? Exactly. What do you want from me? Service. What service? Can't you see what's going on? The forces of darkness are threatening Europe. And you know what it's called, don't you Guzek? Invasion. A planned, organized invasion. Europe is being flooded with Islamic hordes threatening the fundamental values upon which our whole world is based. And who was supposed to defend us? The elites? Look at what they've brought upon us. We want you to help us to resist the fall of Europe. With words and deeds. And what's in it for me? My friends, today is a huge day for me because the "Stop Islamization" channel has subscribed to my vlog. In a moment I will show you some screenshots so you can see for yourselves. I hope this will be the start of something big. Marta, our volunteer, a student at the Academy of Fine Arts. Let's put the lifeboat out. Right. I wanted you to see it from this side. Oh, Tomek! - Thank you. - Actually, our Tommy. For years we went to his town on vacation. Then Tommy came to Warsaw, studied a little law at Warsaw University. - Now he's helping me with this installation. - Great. Hi, Pawel Rudnicki. Tomasz Giemza. I find you very impressive. - Are you interested in politics? - No, absolutely not. And what are you interested in? People. Oh. If you change your mind, come on over. We need young people. This installation is by a German artist. We transported it all from Hamburg by truck. These are all original things of refugees from transit camps. I wanted you to see it from this side because it's a wave. A wave that collects everything. It has the strongest impact from this side. Can you see it? There's no doubt that the refugee crisis is a turning point in the recent history of Europe. We've reached a point where the old formula just doesn't work anymore. It's at such moments in history when huge opportunities are born. But they also bring huge threats. In my opinion, avoiding dialogue is one of these threats. Dialogue is and was the greatest European value. Even with the radicals who preach outrageous things. Thank you. Time for your questions. Yes, I noticed you put your hand up before. Give him the microphone, please. This is for Mr. Rudnicki. You talk about dialogue but it's nonsense coming from you. Can you please tell us what your father did in January 1976? - He joined the Party. - I don't see any connection to the topic. - I'm sorry, if you want to ask... - But there is a connection! Because your father was a representative of the apparatus of repression. Excuse me, what is the question? I'm getting to it. Your father belonged to the Party, right? - What does this have to do with today? - And what about your mother? - Is that the question? - Your father was a communist traitor. - He was a communist traitor! - Sit down! Take the mic away from him! Shut up! Take the mic! Generation to generation, it's all the same shit. Get him out! He was a communist pig! Communism! Down with communism! ...pig! Down with communism! DIALOGUE RUDNICKI-STYLE Down with communism! Fascists! Awesome! Where did you find this nutcase? - I've no idea who he is. - Sure. Really, he came by himself. Never seen him before. Good job. And the client? Full erection. He's asked us to try and find a social scandal. A social scandal? I thought about that too. Don't let it go to your head. "Don't twist everything upside down"? Our client uses some strange sayings. So what? It's pretty late. We have to get up in the morning. Sure. - Ok. I'll see to it soon. - Good morning. Listen, we have to... - Morning. - Morning. Tomasz Giemza, I'm here to see Mr. Rudnicki. Welcome to the team. Can you tell me what made you change your mind? You said you weren't interested in politics. True, but I decided that it was ignorance on my part. Given the difficult times we're living in, I think it's worth getting involved. You see, sir... - Pawel. - You see, Pawel... I feel like the forces of darkness are looming over Europe. I mean tribalism, nationalism, authoritarianism. They threaten the fundamental values of our world. Forgive me if it sounds overdramatic but I feel that you, as the mayor of this city, you could manage to resist the fall of Europe. Quite a speech. Did you meet Asia? She'll show you around. - Hi. - Hi, Tomasz. This is the main room, marketing is here, and over there is our social team. We spend most of our time here. That's how it looks. Hi everyone. You know, from what I can see, Rudnicki didn't order anyone to do it. So it must have been someone from his party. But who did they hire? Yellow Hand on the trail, fuck me. No way. What job was it? Nationwide, now for the parliamentary elections. But I allowed myself a trip inside your area. But aren't they our client's competition? You can't serve competing clients! We can do everything. Ok. Upload it. Don't forget the hashtags! - Pawel, energy, from last year. - That's great, thank you. How are you doing? Great! Thank you very much. You've seen nothing yet, wait till the end of the campaign. Pawel? - Nevermind, sorry. - Tell me, come on. You know, I was thinking... Maybe we could grab something to eat sometime? Sure, how about Thursday evening? Friday after 6 pm would be better. Is Thai ok? ...so he didn't get it? What a guy! No, he didn't. Those drinks were pretty strong. Well then? A walk to sober up? With pleasure. And the other one... he thought it was four, but in the afternoon. - Let's get another drink. - No, Tomek, no. - It's very discreet, photos are banned. - No, I really shouldn't. Listen, I promise we'll leave if it gets too crazy. I promise. Come on. Let's drink and dance. Only the first for me. - Come on! - No, I'll just watch. Rudnicki partying with the LGBT sect. Pawel, I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what came over me. What the hell was I thinking? Don't be so hard on yourself. It's not your fault. I don't remember a thing. Zero control. I don't remember a thing. I always control myself after drinking, and I never drink a lot. My mother drank herself to death when I was ten. Keep that to yourself. I can't do it, fuck. I'm sorry. I need a break for a few days. I have to think it all through. I don't know... No. That'd be the stupidest thing you could do right now. Think of all those thousands of people who want to vote for you. Those people believe in a world free of populism and evil. You can't take that away from them now. I wanted to keep my private life and the campaign separate. It didn't turn out as I hoped. And for that I'm really sorry to all of you. However, it made me realize that it's not about my fucking ego. But about our voters, who believe in me and believe in a world based on reason, and fucking justice. A world free of populism and evil. But if anyone feels that they want to leave, this is the moment. I'll understand. Okay, I'm leaving then. You can't. Ok. Really? Our Tommy? Pawel can't praise him enough. Diligent, ambitious, supportive. Who would have thought it? Robert, how many tickets do we have for Wednesday? As many as we want, I can get more. Let's invite him. Gabi, what about you? How do you feel? Could be awkward. But ok, let's take him. ...ruthless, ruthless. On the other hand, he shouldn't have to hide it. - That's not how you should do politics. - I agree. Truth is the most important thing. But now that the polls are back to normal after our statement, we can only keep our fingers crossed and move forward. It's great that he has you on his staff. Tommy. Here she is! - Excuse me. - We're going inside. - Hi. - Hi. She's always late. Zosia... Oh, right, Tommy. Are you coming to our leaving party? Leaving party? For Gabi and Staszek. They're moving to New York. Sorry, I'm not thinking straight at this time of night. - I'd love to come by. - Great. Just reminding you about Gabi's leaving party. Today at eight. Best regards, Zofia Krasucka. Are you coming? No, I'll stay here for a while. Close up for the weekend. [March in support of Pawel Rudnicki!] [Stop Rudnicki! Blockade of the march of traitors and deviants] Judgment Day has come. We want you to help us. Resist the collapse of our continent. Of course. What's it about? I can't, I'm sorry. What do you mean you can't? You agreed to cooperate, Guzek. [Let's go!] This is called fucking desertion, the punishment will be severe! If it were anything else, but this mission is too... You said it yourself, sometimes you have to spill blood... - [Say no to fascism!] - ...to save billions. [Yes to tolerance!] Aren't those your words? Well? I need some time to think it through. What is there to think about, Guzek? Can't you see it's the only way to make them listen? They will always look down on people like us. [Stop Fascism!] [Nationalist scum!] - What do you mean? We are the victims of circumstance. [Wake up, Europe!] They tell us to fuck off. [We'll block you, perverts] All it takes is one screw-up and then you're done for them! Can't you see it? This fucking contempt? [Plankton. Ignorance] You'll always be a nobody to them! [Pleb. Scum] And I'm not a nobody! I'm not a fucking nobody!! Do you get it?! I do. [Traitors] Calm down. [Sieg heil! Scum!] Who are you talking about? [We will hunt you down!] The elites! I'm talking about European elites. Don't you remember, Guzek, how they kicked you out of that debate?! They threw you out like trash. And you'll remain trash to them unless you change something. Don't you get it? - The march is tomorrow at 6pm, so... - I can't. I'm sorry, not now. Guzek. Guzek, for fuck's sake! Come back here, you fuckhead! Come back here, fuck! You fucking prick! Fuck! Fuck! Fucking hell! Good afternoon everyone. I'm glad that so many of you came, despite the short notice. I want to thank every one of you. My friends! Let's prove that we're immune to the cheap provocations of radical groups. We won't give in to online trolls and haters! Let us join together on this day with our great mayoral candidate, Pawel Rudnicki! Pawel! Pawel! Thank you, thank you very much. We're on an extremely tight schedule. We still have to go to Brodno and Ochota today. But we came to you first because you fill us with so much energy and faith. Thank you! Freedom! Equality! Democracy! Freedom! Equality! Democracy! Let's not go over there. - Let us pass! - Robert. - We can't give up, alright? - We won't. It's what they want. We can't lose our balance. Dumb fucks! Who comes up with all those dumb slogans anyway? I'd lock them up in cages. Shit! Scum! Natalia, what are you up to now, in Poland? I'm taking care of my parents. And Gabi? Did she land already? Yes, just a few hours ago. On Wednesday, she's starting an internship at some cool exhibition. She's going to apply to college. Nothing left for her here anyway. Do you see what's going on? At least the people are mobilized. - Did you see how many of us there were? - Still less than theirs. Or maybe we should organize a meeting of the Rudnicki Support Committee? But a big one. That's a great idea! Are you nuts?! You can't fucking break into someone's computer! "We can do everything." You've disappointed us, Guzek. Fortunately, you will have the opportunity to make up for that. You will keep your promise, right? I will but on different terms. What kind of terms? First of all, you get the gear. It's too risky for me to organize it. Anything else? After the mission, you pick me up - ...and transport me to your secret base. - That was already arranged, Guzek. Is that all? No. Then speak. I need money. Guzek, this isn't work, this is service! You're a warrior, not a mercenary! The money isn't for me. For whom then? - It's not important. - Guzek, we have no money. - We're doing this for our ideals. - No money, no deal. So you're just one of those assholes who vlogs bullshit on the Internet for attention, right? The fucking money is for my grandma, alright? I can't just leave her like that. She needs meds and stuff. What the fuck do you know about living in this filth for so long? What do you think it's like to come home and there's nothing here but four walls? Maybe I can handle it but I don't want her to live like that. So if I'm not going to be here, I have to leave her something. And it's not easy for me to ask. How much? Twenty thousand. Such means are not at our disposal at this moment. Ten. Welcome to our viewers at home. With us today is Pawel Rudnicki from Union for the Future, and also a senator from Dignity and Solidarity - Maciej Szozda. Gentlemen, what would you change in the capital if you were to win the upcoming local elections? I think that the huge propaganda machine and the demagogy of the senator's party has created a "multi-culti", as the malicious like to call it. Something that Poles should fear. In reality, if we shut ourselves off, a rather sad future awaits us: we'd quickly run out of... That's what you do all the time, you twist everything upside down. You got it wrong, I think. That's not how you say it. - Well... - I'll twist however I want. ...you twist everything upside down... ...you twist everything upside down... ...you twist everything upside down... Good evening. I'd like to speak with Mr. Szozda. Tomasz Giemza from Best Buzz PR. Sorry, what do you want? I would like to talk about the terms of cooperation. - You can finish by yourself now. - Dad, don't go! Mati... Svieta, please take care of Matilda. Good evening. - Tomasz Giemza, I take care of your... - Follow me to my study. What can I do for you? I'm working for you. At the campaign. And what can I do for you? I need a bonus. Otherwise, there may be a problem with maintaining discretion. How much? 10 thousand zlotys. You got it. I will send it to you tomorrow morning, okay? Ok. Anything else? No. Maybe I can get a cab for you, or my driver could give you a ride? That'd be nice. Mr. Szozda is a good man, isn't he? He loves his daughter so much. He'd give his life for her. Matilda is his happiness. - Yeah, family is the most important. - Right? If you show up at the house again, I'll rip your head off. What the fuck did you do? "If this happens again, our cooperation is over." - I have no idea what you mean. - Better think of something, or...! - I'm trying, but... - For now, you'll do moderating. Girls, come here. You'll work here now. A break from politics will do you good. Get the fuck out! Chop chop! Fucking punk, get lost! Come on, girls. The high command has agreed to pay you. - Great. - After completing the mission, of course. In such situations, the high command applies the principle of limited trust. Then tell the high command that if I don't get ten, or maybe even fifteen thousand, the deal is off. Fifteen? I thought about it. It's still not enough for what I'm doing. What do we have today? Fetuses, fetuses, fetuses. I'll throw you into the water. I'm forever young. Fetuses, fetuses, fetuses. Beata, I wanted to apologize to you. I've made a lot of mistakes lately. Everyone can have a bad time. I'm hoping you're preparing something big. I won't disappoint you. What about the bugs? Anything? No, nothing. I'm raising a child alone. And you? What's your excuse? Capable, smart, insolent, fast. You could do so many other things. I could. But why? Work for you is exciting. There is no routine in it. You have some influence on the world. Come. I'll walk you home. Is this your son? What do you need the money for? - Doesn't matter. - It does. What for? Private purposes. What private purposes? For my mom. Do you get it? She's sick. She's all I've got. I can bear anything, but I can't watch her suffer. It's hard for me to ask. I have to help her. I just have to. Why was her funeral in the Netherlands? What happened a few years ago? Hmm? And what about the Krasuckis? Why did you bug them? I'll transfer eight thousand to you and take it from your salary. Get the fuck out. Yes, first serve the eggplant dip, the humus and all that. It's good everything is gluten-free and organic... The panel lasts till 14:30, then a break, coffee, cookies, then the panel again. So you'll have time to clean everything up, change the catering, and remember: no plastic plates or plastic forks because the press will get hung up on it. And what about the programs, who's preparing them? Because I don't think we have enough. I'll take care of the posters and leaflets myself. Ok, so that's it. - Ok, gotta go, getting in a taxi. Bye. - Ok, bye. I've got it, all of it. We know. You think we're not watching you? What time is the pick-up? 21.00. Don't be late. What about my money? You make me wait so long. I can't take it much longer... Three and a half thousand euros. Yes, I know the price. If everything goes right, you'll get four. Now kill me. In what sense? You heard. Kill me and take the lightning from my inventory. Ok, take it easy. - Kill me! - Okay. So right after I complete the mission, you'll come and pick me up - and transport me to the secret base, right? - As agreed. - Can I have one last request? - Speak. - Can I see you somehow? - No. Too big a risk. We'll see each other soon anyway. Promise? I promise, brother. Thank you. - Oh, hi. - Hi. It's the main panel now? Pawel is so stressed. - Were you in the office? - Yes. I have to go back there soon. - Where is he? - Upstairs. Oh, sorry. - Hi. - Hi. Are your parents here? Yes, they are. I'm going to get them before they get lost. So many people! We don't have enough programs. I thought there'd be more. I'm just going to the office for another box. So they are in the office? Relax, I'll handle it. No, you go home and get some rest. Pawel! - Pawel, come on. - I'm coming. Thank you very much. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here today. Let's do this. Come on, let's begin. Pawel! Pawel! - Gabi, what are you doing here? - I came back. Why? - Excuse me. - I came here because I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. I cut you off. I know it must have hurt. I really have to go. Tomek. You didn't deserve how I treated you. Gabi, listen, maybe we can just go for a walk, huh? But where? I don't know, outside. Come on, just walk. But isn't the panel starting soon? Excuse me sir, is everything alright? Clearly. Why? Never mind. Just checking. Thanks a lot. The assassin was a young man from Warsaw. In April 2017, Stefan G. was charged with possessing explosives. However, the criminal proceedings were discontinued due to doubts about the sanity of the accused. Before the attack, Stefan G. stole a gun from a Warsaw shooting range, a fact established thanks to the CCTV recordings. Stefan G. claims he was part of an international organization but there is no indication that this ever actually existed. The deputy head of the National Security Agency has said there is no reason to believe the attacker was acting for any terrorist organization. It seems like he was acting alone, as a result of his obsession with the tragically deceased Pawel Rudnicki. Stefan G. testified that he "heard voices" from a computer game which "gave him orders". Preliminary tests have shown that the attacker was insane at the time of the attack. Many survivors have confirmed they owe their lives to the heroism of Tomasz Giemza, a volunteer from Pawel Rudnicki's campaign team, who risked his own life to overpower the attacker and prevent any further bloodshed. Internet users have initiated a "Thanks Tomek!" social media campaign where you can personally congratulate him for his extraordinary courage. The man behind the initiative is the main rival to Pawel Rudnicki in the election, Maciej Szozda. [Thanks Tomek!] It's a huge tragedy. People have died. It turns out that politics is not a game. This is a personal tragedy for me. In the wake of the tragedy, the most important political parties in Poland issued a manifesto entitled Dialogue Based on Respect. In a post, the initiators wrote... How are you? - Fine. - "... and not a spectacle of hate." It hurts a little, but it's okay. Scum. Major Jan Polanski, Delegation from the Internal Security Agency. Lt. Agata Domaniewska, Department for Combating Terrorism and Strategic Threats. Thank you for your heroic actions. Photograph no. 5. Kazimierz Czerwinski the security guard murdered during the break-in at the firing range. Photograph no. 6. Do you know what I've been through? There are certain reasons to assume that Stefan Guzkowski had an accomplice. By what right are you showing me such photos? The angle at which he was stabbed doesn't match Stefan Guzkowski's height. Are you from the Counter-Terrorism Department? - That's right. - So maybe you could tell me how come a guy accused of possessing explosives, a guy who repeatedly incites people to violence on the Internet, is not on your watch list? We don't have the resources - ...to monitor everything on the net. - So maybe you can tell me how come someone in this country can break into a shooting range, steal weapons, ammunition, brutally murder a guard, and you do absolutely nothing about it? The burglary and murder were only reported after... We were waiting there! What took you so long? - Please call the nurse. - Of course. You have no heart, you have no heart. What happened? What's going on? Hello Beata. I know you're behind it. And do you know what this is? It's my back-up. More specifically, evidence about you. Organized mobbing, stalking, bullying. Destroying the images of companies and private individuals. And if that wasn't enough, I also have a transfer confirmation for eight thousand zlotys. Guess what I spent it on? And you? What do you have on me? It'd be a shame about the kid. With you in jail, who'll take care of him? You've already fucked up one kid. Now you want to lose another? And Beata remember that we work very well together. I would like to keep it that way. So I'd like something new to work on. I'm going to get some tea. Want anything? No, thank you. Beata... please tell Kamil that he doesn't work here anymore. Thanks. Can you help me a little? How was work? All good? A lot to do, but at least it keeps my mind occupied.
