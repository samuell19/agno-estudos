How’d it go? - Ah, kicked up a storm. - Hey, come on, you two. I’m going to be late for my breakfast. - Come here. - Phoebe, let him go. - Nell, if we want this reforestation bill to fly, we need a right arm in the senate. So if you get senator Dietz to show up at the benefit... - Oh, he’ll be there. I talked to his wife at that ridiculous luncheon for Washington spouses. Your father adored it. - Dietz’ office still hasn’t confirmed. - I’ll pin him down at the breakfast this morning. What else? - We need to be back at the office by 10:00. I’ve set up a conference call with representatives Deming and Schofield on that education initiative. - Forget the call. I’ve already talked to pat. Just send Joel over with the proposal. - Proposal to Schofield yesterday. - Charlie, I hate that thing. - Good. I’ll get you one. - You all right, sweetie? Hmm? All right. - O.K. Bye. Sweetie, you drive carefully. All right? Talk to you later. O.K.? Bye. Charlie, come on! - See ya later. I’ll call ya. - Here we are. - Senators! - Hi. - Hi. Yes. - Good to see you. - Kelly Ryan. - How are you? - Hello. - You know Mrs. Harrington. - We should go on in. - Good to see you. - I’m glad we caught up with you. Good morning, everybody. - Hey, good morning. How’d the breakfast go? - I think we got senator Dietz in our pocket. - She nailed it. - All right. - Anything drastic this morning? - A fund request, ozone layer statistics, Doreen is typing your speech for tomorrow. - Great. I can’t wait to read it. - Asap. - No. As soon as possible. - Hey, Charlie, environmental protection fund sent me the press kit for the global warming benefit. Nice profile on Nell. Featured speaker. - This is great. Sarah, call Leanne at EPF. Tell her Dietz is a yes. - Leanne’s getting me a list of photo ops. Looks like they’ve lined up some really heavy hitters. - Tell them to go full court press. Joel, run this over to Pat Schofield’s office. - Got it. - What is this on the fax machine? - Junk mail. A Chinese menu. - Listen, don’t anybody order from panda Jade garden, right? - Your 10:00 is early. Jerry... - Barbetto, right. - I gave him a decaf and sent him inside. - Nell, when you get a minute, it’s from EPF. - Good. Oh, we got this. [Buzzer] They ready to vote? What bill? - Medicare. - It’s about time. - Nell, your call to representative Deming? - Just table it. Mr. Barbetto, I am so sorry. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I’ve just been called over to the chambers. You wanna walk over with me? - After you. - Good. - All right, y’all. See you later. - Bye. - I’ll make the call. - Whereas the disadvantaged kids in our healthy start programs test better emotionally, educationally, and nutritionally. We have a study from Miami medical... Rock solid statistics. The only thing we don’t have is adequate funding. Yeah. Isn’t that always the way? Listen, why don’t you send me that Miami study and anything else you’ve got? All right? This slots right into that legislation I’m working on. - It’s a pleasure to meet you. - Well, let’s see if we can do some good. Good-bye. Hi. - Now, active labor contraction. And, go. - [Short breaths] - Perfect. You’ve got that down. All right, let’s try the next. Yes, I’m very proud of us, o.K.? Now you’re dilating more. We’re going to switch over to pattern pace breathing. All right? O.K. [Quick breaths] - I hope you’re this calm when the baby comes. - I can’t wait. Just watch my fingers. - You can’t count, Charlie! - Would you stop it? Just breathe, o.K.? - I’m getting the urge to push. - Well, blow. Blow. Hello. I hope you’re getting all of this. - No, the baby seems to be napping...For once. - I love this. - I love you. What? -Nothing. I’ll be right back. - What, do you have to? - I’m not pregnant. - I know. - You’re the best. - You’re blocking the view. - Something over in this corner over here? - O.K., hit me with the spot. - Now, she obviously isn’t as tall as you are, right? - Obviously. - So we’re going to have to raise the light up a little bit so there’s no Mike shadow on her. Or we could just move the light to the other side, and then we wouldn’t have to worry about that Mike shadow at all. - I’ll wait outside. - Testing. How’s this for volume? - Where the hell’s that music guy? - Hey, Phoebe. - What are you doing here? - How about a hello? I heard Nell was the main event, but I didn’t expect to see you. Does this mean you’re back in her club? - A lot of changes, frank. - So I see. When’s the baby due? - Uh...six weeks, five days. - Hey, you look good. - I feel good. - Where you singing these days? - I’m not. - Oh, come on. - Something about doing torch songs in a slinky, black maternity dress. - Sounds very nineties. - I quit, frank. My life was a mess. I’m much happier now. I don’t miss it. - Did I say you did? - Then stop smiling. - I’m happy to see you. - Long time. - Eh, not so terribly long. - Oh, there you are. If you could just sit at the piano for a minute, we need to set levels. - Frank, Charlie Ryan. We talked on the phone. I really liked your demo tape. - Thanks. - This is my wife, Phoebe. - Yes. We’ve met. - Why don’t we get started on this, all right? - Sure. - Come on. Look at that. What’s that? Come on. Come on. Yes. Beautiful. Perfect. - Simon, we’re going to be late. Would you hurry? - Yes, I’m coming. All right. - Come on. - Morgana, my darling, we’re wanted in court. - Simon! - You have to admit that it would make quite an entrance. - The animal rights people would have my hide. - Better your hide than a mink’s, dear. Those, I think. In medieval times, a falconer Manning a new bird would carry it with him wherever he went, even to church. - We’re not going to church. - There are rumors of falconers bringing new birds to the bedchamber... Hooded, of course. - You’re not going to leave this bird in here. I just had the rug cleaned. - No, not tonight, darling. I’ll bring her back to the mews on my way to the car. - Would you please go and get your tie fixed? We’re going to be late for my speech. - Oh, yes. The speech. - Yes. How did you like it? - Oh, it’s a corker. Inspiring, really. It made me want to go out and save the planet. - How do you expect to do that? You can’t even tie your tie. - Plant a tree or two, I suppose. - Well, I’m glad you liked it because if it goes well, it’ll be the springboard for my senatorial declaration. - Oh, you’ve decided then. - I think it’s now or never. - I still remember the day you came into my classroom, and I said, "it’s Joan of arc." - Why, did you think I heard voices? - No. I thought you’d lead men into battle. And so you will. - Thank you. - Oh, you’re carrying high. It’s a boy, of course. Did you do ultrasound? - No, we decided to wait to find out. - Good for you! Back in my day, we just took our chances, and I got what I wanted every time. - "She was a Gordian shape of dazzling hue, vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue." - Oh, thanks, dad. - Hi, Lorna. I see you’ve met my daughter. - Yes. She’s a treasure, and I guarantee you that’s a boy. - How lovely. You look beautiful. - I feel like a houseboat. - Nonsense. You look just as you should. - Good evening. Simon. - Ah, Charles. - Charlie, guests... Who’ve we got? - So far, guest of honor, we have got 17 from the house, we got 4 senators and a couple of movie stars, and there’s a news crew from CBS. So I’d say we’re batting .600 before the first speech. Let me take you around, all right? - Excuse me. - Will you look at her go? Like a salmon up a waterfall. - Charlie’s in heaven. He lives for this. - So does your mother. Guess you and I are here for the ride. - I like to think of myself as the power behind the throne. - Personally, I had more than my fill of cutthroat politics chairing the medieval studies department. - You miss teaching, dad? - Well, I miss my students, but I’m plowing great swaths through my new book. I certainly don’t miss the faculty meetings. May I get you ladies a drink? - Oh, yes. A Martini, please. - Phoebe, Shirley temple for old time’s sake? - Nothing. - No? Be right back. - We’ve heard too much about the threat of global warming. We can’t afford to distance ourselves with the language like "threat." Something that may or may not come to pass. Global warming is not a threat but a crisis in progress. The Chinese word for crisis has two different meanings in English. Danger and opportunity. Our earth is already in danger, so we must seize this opportunity to change the behaviors that cause and continue to cause an environmental catastrophe of global proportions. The most urgent problem facing us today is convincing the public that there is a problem. But to those who would say, "we don’t have all the facts yet," I answer that when you are hurtling headlong towards disaster, you don’t take a poll, you take action. We’re condemning this earth to the gallows, and we must mend our ways now if we plan to get out of this one alive. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - ♪ Tonight must be the night ♪ ♪ the one we won’t forget ♪ ♪ we’ll make good love together ♪ ♪ make it last forever ♪ ♪ showtime is a quarter... ♪♪ - That’s beautiful. You should go up there and sing. - Charlie, I’m all mingled out. Can we go home? - No, I’m serious. Why don’t you go take a few numbers? It’ll be perfect. - Nobody wants to hear somebody’s kid sing. - I hate it when you say that. You’re not someone’s kid. You’re a wonderful singer. - I’m not going to sing here. - Come on. It’s brilliant. This is Nell’s night, you’re her daughter... - She’d hate it. - You’re out of your mind. She’d be crazy about it. I’ll tell that pianist... - No! I said... - What’s the matter? - Will you stop? You don’t know how to stop! - I’m sorry. Excuse me. Phoebe? Phoebe? - Yes, mom. - Honey, are you all right? Are you sick? Should I call someone? - I’m fine. - You don’t sound fine to me. - I’m tired. I’ve been here for hours, and if one more woman touches my belly, I’m going to deck her. - Honey, you’ve been feeling tired quite a bit lately. That’s not right. Maybe you should go to the doctor again. - I’ve been on my feet for hours. I’m seven months pregnant. - I guess I was just lucky to feel terrific right to the end. The day before you were born, I argued a case before... The supreme court. - The supreme court. - I won it, too, and I was back on the job... Six days later. Right. - Six days later. Yes, I know. - Hi, Charlie. - Hey. Are you all right? - Nobody else seems to thinks so. - Oh, honey... - I think so. I think you are stupendous. - Call me a cab. - Sweetie... - Mother, I’m fine. I’m fine. Good night. - I love you. - I love you, too. - She’s going to be fine. I’ll take her home. Enjoy yourself. - O.K. You were great. - No, you were great. You were a hit. Good-bye. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. - Bye-bye. Ohh...hi, Terry. Good to see you. - Here. Don’t want you to catch cold. - You know, Charlie, you really don’t have to leave yet. I can take a cab. - No way. I’m staying with you. - I’m really all right. - I believe you, but I’m wrapped here. There’s nothing left but the mop-up. I got to get home anyway. I’ve got work to do. - Tonight? - Yeah. Why not? Tonight went like clockwork. I feel like a million bucks. [Tires screech] Who taught this moron to drive? Save the stunts for the speedway, all right? - Thank you. - A triumph, I’d call it... Your speech in particular. - I was preaching to the converted. - No, no no, Charlie told me it raised a great deal of money. Wiped up, I believe was his phrase. - Did you talk to Phoebe this evening? - Yes. I had a perfectly lovely chat with her about my new book. - How did she seem to you? - She seemed fine. Well, she’s never been particularly fond of these galas. They’re more Charlie’s meat, but... - You were right about the earrings. I got several compliments. - I’m usually right. - You used to say always. - I’m older and wiser now. I’m hedging my bets. - [Laughs] Ahh. [Sighs] - You know what struck me tonight as I looked at Phoebe? It was the flush of dynastic pride. My daughter about to give birth to my grandchild. Oh, there’s no other way to describe it. It felt miraculous. - You’ll be a spectacular grandfather, daddy. [Telephone rings] - Oh...sake. It’s 1:00 in the morning. - Hello? What? Where? - Ma’am, you can see I have my hands full here. - Tell me something. My son-in-law and my daughter... - I’ll be with you as soon as I can. - Just tell me they’re still alive! - Yes, Nell, they are. They are. - How did you get here? - I’ve got a friend who works in the E.R. He called me. I got here as soon as I could. - What happened? - Their car hit a wall. Phoebe’s not badly hurt. She’s got whiplash and a few bruises, but they’re afraid she might miscarry. They’ve hooked her up to a fetal monitor. - Representative Harrington? - Just a minute. What happened to Charlie? - They don’t know the extent of the injuries. - Somebody must know something! - Excuse me, ma’am. Lieutenant Grody, metropolitan police. I’m investigating your son-in-law’s accident. - How badly hurt is he, lieutenant? - Apparently, he went right through the windshield. - The ambulance squad said he never regained consciousness. They took him right into surgery. - But what happened? It’s my press secretary. Just tell me, please. - He took a skid down an off-ramp and ran head-on into a retaining wall. The road was slick. There was a chance he was speeding. I’m sorry to tell you this, ma’am, but my unit checked out the scene, and we found some narcotics. - You mean they were hit by some crazy, drugged-out... - No, ma’am. There were no other vehicles. The narcotics were found in his pocket. - What? - Whose pocket? - Mr. Ryan’s. - That’s not possible. - I’m sorry. We sent the evidence down to the lab for analysis, but it looks like we’re talking a couple grams of cocaine. - No. There must be some kind of mistake. - No mistake, ma’am. I found it myself. We’re still checking, but he’s probably facing charges of illegal possession, DUI, and reckless endangerment. - I don’t believe this. - Let’s wait until we get the blood tests. I’ll keep you informed. - Good lord. - I don’t believe it. - Look, Nell, we’re going to have to keep this out of the press. You going to be all right? - Nell, you all right? - No, I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine. - O.K. - It’s been two hours. - I haven’t wanted a cigarette in 15 years. - Sit down for a minute. You’ll wear yourself out. - How could Charlie do something so stupid? I could just throttle him. The press is gonna love this. So much for running for the senate. - We better see Phoebe. - How can he do that to her and to the baby? - Nell, stop it. - I just hate being helpless. - I just hate it! - Come on. Sit down. Please. - Oh, Simon. I hope they’re all right. - Come on. - I was so happy when they first started dating. The two of them getting together, you know? - Mr. and Mrs. Harrington? - Yes? - You can see your daughter now. - Phoebe, your parents are here. Please try not to get her excited. - Hi, darling. - Charlie...have you seen him? No one’s telling me anything. - He’s still in surgery. We don’t know anything. - They’re lying. They have to know something. - Don’t get worked up now. It’s bad for the baby. - They have to know something. - I’ll go and find out. I’ll come right back. I promise, o.K.? Just relax. - Darling, they’re doing the best they can, I’m sure. Charlie’s in good hands. Everything’s going to be all right. - We have been here for hours, and no one has given us one piece of straight information. - Ma’am, I’m sorry. - Nell. How’s Charlie? - It appears to be a state secret. - Look, we need to talk. Over here. - What? - Just sit. It’s not good. The media picked up the story. Has anybody been in here to talk to you? - Reporters? No. - Good. Let’s keep it that way. - If Charlie is really involved in drugs, I’m not going to whitewash it for him. - Nobody is talking about a whitewash, but he’s the head of your staff and your son-in-law. - We’ll take it head-on. I’ll call a press conference, and then we’ll just come forward with it ourselves. Maybe somebody will respect our honesty. God knows I’m going to need as much help... - Why don’t we just sit tight until we’ve got all the facts? - Mrs. Harrington? I’m Dr. Strathwood. I operated on your son-in-law. - Oh, no. - I’m sorry. - No. Charlie. Oh, Charlie. - Nell, can I, uh... - Damn you, Charlie! What a waste! I can’t stand this. - Where is she? - Simon! - I’m right here, my love. - He’s gone! He’s gone. Charlie’s gone. - I know. - I loved him so much. - I know it. - What were the results of the drug tests? - I’m afraid they were positive. - Well... There it is. - How are we going to tell Phoebe? - Let’s tell her that he... Just got out of surgery. Maybe by tomorrow... - He’s not... Get away from me. No, it’s not true. No, is it? He’s not dead. He can’t be. No! My god, no! Charlie, please! Let me get to my husband, please! Charlie, please! God, no! Oh, no, daddy, no! - Charlie Ryan worked on my staff for nine years. He’s been my administrative assistant for four years. Last year, he married my daughter. I’d hoped to be able to stand here today and deny allegations, but I will not lie to the public. Hospital blood tests confirmed that Charlie, my... My beloved son-in-law Charlie, was, in fact, using cocaine at the time of the accident. I know now what every parent must feel in this circumstance. "How could this happen?" "How could I be unaware this was happening?" [Cameras whir] I will never accept Charlie’s death, and I will never stop missing him, and I will never assume, as I did... That drug abuse is a problem that happens to somebody else. Nobody is safe. Nobody... I... - How will this impact your work in the area of drug abuse? - Perhaps you shouldn’t proceed if... - I will continue to fight for anti-drug legislation and particularly for drug education. - What is your daughter’s condition? - Mrs. Ryan’s condition at this point is stable, as is the fetus’. We don’t expect complications. - Representative Harrington, you’ve had a terrible shock, and you have my condolences. In your statement, you claimed that you had no awareness at all that your top aide, a man you saw daily and under high pressure for nine years, might be using cocaine on the job. - That is correct. - Might it not be possible that you would also be unaware of cocaine usage by his wife? - My daughter is 7 months pregnant. - Isn’t it possible that she might also be using cocaine? - Absolutely not! - Mrs. Ryan’s blood and urine were tested for drugs as a matter of hospital policy. Both tests came back negative. - There’s no story there. - Look, I’m not gonna be able to make it till 5:00. - Representative Harrington’s office. No. I’m sorry. She’s not in the office at this time. - Nell, what are you doing here? We didn’t expect you in so soon. - Life has to go on somehow, doesn’t it? - Full-court press on the educa... - He should be here. This isn’t right. - No, it’s not right. Nothing about this is right. What’s the response been? - Mixed. Not what we hoped for. So far, only about 40% of the calls have been positive. So much for respecting honesty. - Listen... You all worked with Charlie. Who knew he was on drugs? You know each other. You go out together. Where was he getting cocaine? How much was he using? Why didn’t somebody tell me? - I didn’t know. - If I ever find out that one of you did know and you didn’t have the courage to face me, I’ll not only fire you, I’ll make sure you never work on the hill again! I don’t want any more secrets. I’ll be at the hospital. - Dr. Adams, Dr. Adams, please contact Dr. Margolis. - Mom. Mom. - What? Hmm? - How long have you been there? - Oh, a couple of hours. Did you get some sleep? - Yecch... I had horrible dreams. - So did I. - I just want to wake up and have this all be over. - Did you know that... Charlie was using cocaine? Did you? - What? - Charlie was using cocaine when the accident happened. - I can’t believe you would think that. There’s got to be a mistake. - He had drugs in his bloodstream. Sweetie, what have I told you ever since you were a little girl? You can tell me anything as long as... It’s true. - It’s true. - Why in the hell didn’t you tell me while we could still do something? You’re not using anything, are you? - No, I’m not on drugs, mother. I haven’t had so much as a glass of wine since the day I found out I was pregnant. You know that. - I don’t know anything anymore. Who would have thought Charlie would do something so stupid? - You don’t know you’re right about that one. - I do know you tried pot when you were a teenager. - Mom...i was born in the sixties. Everybody my age has tried something, unless they grew up in a convent. - No they haven’t. - It’s like asking someone from your generation if they’ve ever had a cocktail. - No, it’s not, and you know it! Don’t try to pretend this is normal. Your husband is dead, and I want to know why it happened. - I want to know why it happened. I tried to get him to stop. At first it was just something to do for fun, something to do at a party, like having a beer, and then it just got out of hand. He’d promise he’d cut back, and then he’d sneak out and buy something. I...i was worried about him... But what could I do? I... I tried everything, but what could I do? Oh, god. Oh, mom! - Shh. - Oh, god! Oh, mom... - Oh, sweetie... - Oh, god! I miss him so much, I don’t think I can stand this. Oh, god. - But you did speak to the doctor? - Yes. He said everything is still fine with the baby. Maybe Phoebe could come home tomorrow. - Oh, but she can’t go back to their place. Let’s bring her here. - I think it would do us all good to get out of Washington. Maybe when we get through with the... Funeral service... I could take some time off. Let’s just take Phoebe up to the lake and stay a while. - What about your plans to announce for the senate? - Guess that’ll have to wait for a while. [Screeching] - Ohh! Ooh! [Screeching] Oh, they’re beautiful. Isn’t she something? - She’s great, dad. [Vehicle approaching] - We picked up some sweet Cologne at Fesco’s stand. Do you know they still have a shoebox for cash and a sign that says "out fishing. Take your own change"? Try that in Washington. - Right. Hi, dear. Did you have fun? - Yeah, it was fun. - Was she like that the whole time? - Well, at least she came out of her room. Morgana, come on, my lady. Would you talk to me instead of the bird for a change? - Oh, Nell, for heaven’s sake. - Well, she won’t eat, she won’t speak, and the baby is due in a month. I don’t know how she’s going to take care of it. I don’t know what to do. - And what wound did ever heal but by degrees? - Oh, stop. - Has he caught any fish? - Not for 10 years. - [Laughing] Well... We won’t starve. Butter and sugar from Fesco’s... A national treasure, or it should be, anyway. If I had a nickel for every ear of corn I have shucked on this dock... - You’d buy me the moon. - Is that what I used to say? - All the time. - Well, that was fairly pretentious of me, wasn’t it? Oh, honey... What can I do to help you? - Nothing. I open my eyes in the morning, and there’s nobody there. - I know it seems like that now, but when the baby comes... - Oh, mother, please don’t tell me how lucky I am to have this baby. I want my husband. - I know you do. - He was the one who wanted this baby. I did this for him. I’m not ready for this. I don’t want to do this alone. - You’re not going to be alone. - Yes, I will. I loved him more than I loved myself. - Honey... - Mother, please don’t tell me you know how I feel, because you don’t. - Phoebe, I may not know the right thing to say, but I am trying. - I know. I know. Nothing helps. [Clock chiming] - Simon, why don’t you just hand me that plate? I’ll wrap it up. Maybe she’ll have it for a midnight snack or something. - There you go. - Thank you. - Mom? - Hmm? What? - Uhh... - Oh, my god. What’s the matter? What happened? Oh, honey. - Oh...oh... - We’ve got to get her to the hospital. Can you get her? - Here you go. Yeah. Here we go. Come on. - I’ll go get a robe and some towels. Get her out there as quickly as possible. - Uhh! - Ok, there’s the head. - I can’t. - Heart rate’s dropped to 94. - Push! You can do it, baby! Push! [Indistinct] You’ve got to help us out now! - Ok. I’m trying. - We just need you to focus, once more, o.K.? Really push his head, o.K.? O.K. Here it comes. - And push! Good girl. Almost. Yes! There it is! Hold it! Hold it. Hold it.... O.K., one more time... And push! Push! Push! - Aah! - We got it. We got it. All right... Suction her out. Let’s bag her. - What? - I’m going to just give her some oxygen. - Extremities are still blue. Heart rate’s 90. - Got it. - What are you doing? - No need to panic. - She’s getting pink. Heart rate’s up. - What’s going on? - It’s o.K. She’s starting to respond. - Showing signs of reflex. - Good. I.D. Her and get her to ICN. It’s a girl. - She looks so... Unfinished. - Why, she...She’s trying to cry. Oh, I wish they could take those tubes out of her. - She just looks so tiny. - Well, she...She is a month early. - Even so. I’m going to go and find phoebe’s doctor. - Nell? - Dr. Charbonneau? Excuse me. - Oh. Hi, Mrs. Harrington. Have you seen your granddaughter yet? - Yes, I did. Could I ask you a few questions, please? I’m in the middle of rounds... - Could you just tell me, why was she born premature? - Well, it could be nutrition, hormonal imbalances, overexertion. In phoebe’s case, stress is a likely factor. - What about drugs? - If the mother were using narcotics, then yes, absolutely, drugs would be a factor. Does Phoebe use drugs? - I don’t know. - Then you better ask her. - Her husband was killed in a car crash. He was using cocaine, but phoebe’s blood test came back negative. - Cocaine can be out of the bloodstream in 48 hours. All that would prove is she hadn’t been high for two days when they tested her. - Aren’t there some tests you can do on the baby and on Phoebe that would... - Yes. Yes, there are. If we administer them and either tests positive, the mother could lose the baby to foster care. She could also be prosecuted for carrying drugs to a minor or child abuse. - Are you saying I shouldn’t pursue this? - I’m telling you things that can happen. - Oh... - I read the papers. I know what you’ve been going through. - I appreciate that. - I voted for you. I like your positions on health care. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to deliver some twins. - Dr. Charbonneau, you’ve seen that baby. Do you think it’s possible she was drug-affected? - Yes. It is possible. - Oh... Hey. Well, I’m glad to see you up and around. - Just went down the hall. - To get a soda? - I was thirsty. - I see. Have you seen the baby yet? - Mom... - Have you? - It’s the first time I’ve been on my feet. - And you went for a soda? - I don’t want to see it, all right? - Why, because you’re afraid to see the cocaine you took? - Who said I took cocaine? - Don’t lie to me, Phoebe. I know what you did. - Mother, please. - Do you know she’s in critical condition because of you! - Just listen to what I... - How could you do that to your baby? How could you? - I hurt, mom. My husband’s dead. I had to do something to make the pain stop. - You think you’re the only person in pain because of Charlie? I loved him like a son! - Tell me about it. You two were so tight, I felt like the in-law. - That is no excuse for what you did. You did not have to take drugs! - Well, I did. - Why? - Because it’s what I know. - Did you get him started? - I knew it. I knew you’d blame me for Charlie. - Answer my question! Did you or didn’t you? - No, I didn’t! Charlie got me high... Our first date together. I’d been straight for three years. I tried, mom. I tried to stay clean. You don’t know how hard I tried. - Three years? - Exactly. - You mean all this time she’s... And I thought this was all over with that business in high school. - So did I. She’s certainly not going to tell us the truth, that’s for sure. - If we hadn’t sent her to that boarding school... - Oh! Well, hindsight is brilliant. We thought it would help. - No, no. You thought it would help. - We both did! You agreed. - I knuckled under. - You said, and I quote, "maybe she’ll actually learn something in a more structured environment." - Ha ha! Well, obviously she did. She learned how to lie better. - How did we miss it? - Well, maybe we... We were both too busy. - I spent every spare minute with her. You were off on a sabbatical and I was down in Washington... - Exactly. We weren’t there. - Now, wait a minute. I’m not going to be made to feel guilty because I loved my work. That didn’t mean I loved Phoebe any less. - I’m not saying you loved her less, but... Maybe we shouldn’t have had a child. - Well, we did... And so did Phoebe. - Oh, I’m sorry. I thought this was my daughter’s room. - That’s all right. - Oh, it is her room. Phoebe? Phoebe? - Mrs. Harrington? I called you at home. Your husband said you were already on your way. - Well, where’s Phoebe? - She left. - What? - Apparently, she just walked out of the hospital. Nobody saw her leave. - Oh, now, wait. Wait a minute. You mean Phoebe walked out of the hospital with the baby? - The baby is still in intensive care. - Oh, no. Oh... - I have to ask you an important question. If you can’t locate Phoebe or if she’s in no fit condition, are you prepared to take custody of your granddaughter? - Well...yes, of course. - You might want some time to consider. - Well...yes. The answer is yes. - She’s not critical anymore. She is starting to breathe better. Probably she’ll be off the oxygen in a day or so. - How long will she have to stay in the hospital? - A week, maybe two. - Is that all? - Depends on how well she takes to the bottle. - She’s only a month premature. That’s a big girl for this ward. If we get her eating, she’s ready to roll. Do you want to hold her? - Well...what about all the tubes and things? - It’s all right. We handle them all the time. Hello there, darlin’. [Baby fussing] Good girl. [Baby crying] - Ohh. Ohh. Hey. It’s o.K. So...ohh, ohh. Ohh. It’s all right. It’s all right. It’s all right. - Simon, you’re nervous. - Well, sure. Of course I am. I haven’t seen her since the day she was born. - I’m nervous, too. - Mrs. Harrington. It’s good to see you again. - Oh, hi. - Mr. Harrington? Margo charbonneau. - Oh, how do you do? - Hi. So, today’s the big day. You all ready? - Not really, but... - Here she is. - Ohh. - Hello, sweetie. Hello, sweetie. Hello. Oh, oh, goodness, yes. Do you want to go and see grandpa? Here you go. [Baby cries] Ohh. Oh, she’ll get used to you, Simon. Yes, she did that to me at first, too. - She’s starting to recognize you from the feedings. - Yeah. Did you have your bottle without grandma this morning? - No coughing, no spit-up. A-plus. - Are you going to help with the feedings? - Oh! Well... Yes, probably. - Be patient. It’s harder with babies who’ve been on a feeding tube. They tend to resist the nipple. - Are there likely to be other problems? - It’s hard to predict, especially without being able to ask her mother exactly what she was exposed to in utero. - What if it was cocaine? - There’s no safe amount you can take when you’re pregnant. The damage depends on how much, how often, how far along was the fetus, and if Phoebe was combining it with other drugs... Especially alcohol. Her baby could face some serious problems. - What can we do about it? - Be good parents. Environment will make all the difference. - I still don’t feel right about closing the house. - Aw, honey, she’s not here. If she were, we would’ve found her a week ago. - But what if she comes back? - She’s in Washington. That’s where we’ll find her and that’s where we have to go. - Step. What are we gonna name her? - Her mother will name her. - Ah. There you go. - [Sighs] - Yeah. I’m sure you appreciate the need for discretion as far as the press is concerned. Yeah. Thanks. - I’m heading for home, Mrs. Harrington. Remember, I’ll be late tomorrow. - All right, Margaret. Just as soon as you can, all right? Thank you. Good night. - Good night. - If Phoebe does contact you, just call us collect. Thanks. - Do you know last night I dreamed she drowned in the lake? Just like Ophelia... All covered with flowers. - They’re going to find her. We called all her friends, all of Charlie’s. - It’s really good of you to give up your weekend like this. I appreciate it. - It’s nothing. Did you get a chance to go through all these resumes? We’ve got staff interviews set up first thing on Monday. - I’m trying. I trying. [Baby cries] Oh, no. Oh! Wouldn’t you know? - The minute the sitter leaves. - Yeah. - "I have no name..." [Baby’s cries drown out speaking] "I happy am. "Joy is my name. Sweet joy." - Simon, what are you doing? Is she wet? - She certainly doesn’t appreciate Blake. - Give her to me. - I thought you were working. - I can’t work while she’s making all this noise. Honey, why don’t you go on to sleep? You’ve been up half the night. - Was Phoebe like this? - Not so piercing. Certainly not all the time. - I might have been up for this once in my salad days. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Ooh, sweetheart. Shush. Shush. Granny loves you. Yes. You’re all right. Yes. All right. All right. ♪ Mr. Froggy went a-courtin’ ♪ ♪ he did ride ♪ ♪ did ride ♪ ♪ Mr. Froggy went a-courtin’ ♪ ♪ he did ride ♪ ♪ did ride ♪ ♪ Mr. Froggy went a-courtin’ did ride ♪ ♪ a sword and pistol by his side ♪ ♪ mm-hmm ♪ ♪ mm-hmm ♪ ♪ mm-hmm ♪♪ You’re just like your mama.

Is that phoebe’s? - Yes. What’s the matter? - I have to, uh... I knew about Charlie. I figured I’d better, uh... I made a few phone calls. I think I know how to find Phoebe. - Sorry, we’re closed. Can I help you? - I’m looking for someone. - All right. - I’ll see you inside. - Phoebe. - What are you doing here? - I might ask you the same thing. Go get your things. We’re leaving. - I’m not going anywhere. - You don’t have a choice. You have a baby to think about. - Well, it’s my life. - And you’re my daughter. - And don’t I know it! - What seems to be the problem, ladies? - It doesn’t concern you. Is that where you’ve been staying? - It’s none of your business. - I gave an old friend a safe place to stay. - I’m talking to my daughter! - Stay out of it, frank! -You’re sure you’re... - Shut up! - I am not here to argue! Get out of here! - Mother, will you leave me alone? - No, I will not leave you alone! How dare you? How dare you walk out and leave me to pick up the pieces? I have been up every night with that baby, and I was worried half out of my mind because I thought you were dead! Now, you’re going to start acting like an adult! You’re going to come home and take care of your baby, and you are going to stop taking drugs! - I can’t. - Yes, you can! - You don’t understand. I can’t. - Yes, I understand, and you can! I smoked two packs of cigarettes every day for 26 years, and the day that I decided to quit, I quit. And the first time I ran for congress... - Here we go. Back on the job six days later. Why is it every time I can’t do something you rub my nose in it by saying you can? Why is that, mom? - I am not the issue here! I may not have been the easiest mother, but I did the best I could, and now it’s your turn. - I can’t do it! - You owe it to Charlie. - How can you say that? - Charlie wanted a child more than anything... - Stop it! - No! I will not stop until you promise to come home and see your baby! - I’ve seen her. - You told me you didn’t. - She was hooked up to all these machines. I looked at her. She had a convulsion. I had to get out of there. I couldn’t stand it. - Phoebe. I’m going to get you out of here if I have to drag you. I’m not going to stand by and watch you wreck your life. I lost Charlie. I’m not going to lose you, too. Now, you go get your things. Go on. [Baby crying] [Crying continues] - Nell, you... Oh, Phoebe. Thank god. [Baby crying] - Go ahead. - There, there. Hello, Olivia. Oh, hush. [Baby stops crying] - Oh, damn it. God. - Phoebe, are you all right? - I’m fine. - Here. Are you sick? - No. - You’re white as a sheet. Here, let me have the baby. - I’ve got her! Just... - No, she absolutely will not enter the program without her baby! Well, who is equipped... - She’s 2 1/2 weeks old. She was 4 weeks premature. - No. Those private clinics will not accept women with babies. Can’t you just sug... All right. Thank you. - We’ll have to discuss it, but thanks. Thanks very much. - There are hundreds of thousands of mothers with drug problems. Where do these women go? - Nell, tell me something. Is this something she wants, or is this what you want? - This is what Phoebe needs. - No. That’s not what I’m asking. - Do you have another solution? We have to do something. - Well, I found one. - What? - It’s a residential recovery program called family house. They take pregnant women, mothers with children. They have only 14 beds, and there’s a waiting list up to six months. Well...here. Yes, this is representative Nell Harrington. Well, this looks like a pretty old house. - What difference does that make? - You’re going to be here for six or eight months... - I said I’d talk to them. That’s all I said. - Hello. Hi. I’m Nell Harrington. My daughter, Phoebe Ryan. - Hi. Holly Ellis. I’m the administrative director here, and this is my assistant, Lucinda. She does my job and everybody else’s around here. - Hi. Lucinda bernardi, head of clinical staff. Hi, Phoebe. Can I get you a cup of coffee or something? - Not for me. Darling? - Let’s go up to my office. - Poor baby. - What we can do is set up an appointment with a doctor. - She started using cocaine when Charlie, her husband, was killed. - How long had you been taking drugs before you got pregnant? - Since high school. - Periodically. - Most of the time. - Don’t exaggerate. - Fine. - Look, there’s no judgment here. There isn’t a right or wrong answer. Is this your first pregnancy? - Yes. - Why don’t we let Phoebe answer, all right? - Phoebe? - She already told you. - Excuse me. Lucinda, would you come up to my office, please? Thank you. Would you leave us alone for a while? - But I thought... - I’d like to talk to you one at a time. Lucinda will give you the not-so-grand tour, and we’ll ask you to fill out a family questionnaire. Just some background, all right? - Certainly. Be glad to. [Knock on door] - Yes? - Lucinda, would you give Mrs. Harrington the tour, please? - Sure. - Uh, thank you. - Phoebe, what are you doing here? - What? - Why did you come here? - I already told you. - No, your mother did. I’d like to hear it from you. - I want to take care of my baby. - But what about you? Phoebe, you’re not going to make it here if you come here for your baby or for your mother. They’re not on drugs. You are. But you have got to want to get off. Tell me, do you want to get straight? - Yes. [Telephone ringing] Phone call. I don’t know. - All right, then. Now we’re getting somewhere. - Hi, Judy. - Hi. - Hi, Jordan. - Come on, honey. - Hello. - We always put the new residents in with someone we like to call a mother peer. Someone who’s been on the program for several months. And if the mother already has a child, they’re able to be in here with them. - Phoebe, whatever you did that you think was so awful that you can’t forgive yourself for, you’re going to hear the same story from everyone here. It’s like living with mirrors. - And the residents provide a lot of the emotional support system. They all talk. They learn a lot from each other. - [Sighs] - Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah. I think I’m going to go back downstairs now. - I don’t see what good it does going over all this. - Because you have to look at what really happened without judging everything you did. - Look, it’s not my fault if you don’t believe me. I mean, what do you want me to do? - Drop your guilt. - I already told you... - What you think I wanted to hear. Look, I am not here to beat you up, judge you, or put you down. You do that all right by yourself. Am I right? - Well, obviously. I fed drugs to my baby. - Yeah. Uh-huh. You did. So? - I also took drugs before Charlie died. If I’d known he’d had some drugs left the night of the accident, I probably would’ve spent the whole night trying to get it. I was totally straight for the first four months, though. Really. I didn’t use once. - I believe you. - Yeah, I didn’t think I’d get through that. I had cravings so bad. I was grinding my teeth... And sweats and... Stomach cramps, nightmares. Then I ran into a friend and...And... He had some pot, and I smoked it... And I got started, and I couldn’t stop. I lied to Charlie. I...i...i... I lied to everyone. I ran away from my baby. - So what does that make you? - I wish I were dead. - Well, honey, you’re not. You’re a drug addict. Now, that doesn’t mean that you’re a bad person. That means that you’re a sick person. You have an addictive disease. Now, what we do here is show you the steps towards recovery, but no one can take those steps for you. We’re done. - Will you take her? - I think Phoebe belongs in a setting like this, but I am in an awkward position. Two of our clients graduate on Monday, so I have two beds free. But I also have women lined up on the street. Now, how do I justify putting your daughter ahead of them? - Mrs. Ellis, if you would take Phoebe, I will pay for both beds... Plus the next woman down on your waiting list. Will you take her? - Well, you just may have saved some lives. - Good. - We’ll put Phoebe straight into hospital detox, probably not more than two or three days. First we get her off the drugs, and then we deal with the issues behind the drugs. Now, I should warn you... You probably won’t have any contact with her for quite a while. She won’t be allowed to make any phone calls for the first 14 days or have any visits for 30. - You won’t need those kind of rules for our family. We’re very supportive. - I’m sure. But all families have problems, even supportive ones. - The baby’s asleep. Anything the matter? - Ohh... Phoebe’s out there in some hospital going through detox. - Isn’t that what you wanted? You knocked yourself out to get her into that program. - Did you have a better suggestion? - Aren’t we just shipping her off to a different boarding school, paying some stranger to solve phoebe’s problems? - Simon, somebody had to. We just put her away with a houseful of drug addicts! - She is a drug addict. That’s what Phoebe is, and she needs this kind of help. - We are her parents! - We were her parents when she got into this mess, and a fat lot of good it did us! Letting her poison her baby while you were out flying that stupid bird! - I’ve had enough of this, Nell. I don’t see that you did much better. - Well, at least I did something! "Thinking the deed and not the creed would help us in our utmost need." - Simon, would you stop that? Can’t you ever say anything in your own words? - I don’t have the words for this, Nell! Maybe somebody else would. I am coping with this the best way I know how! - You’re not coping at all! I’ve had to make every single decision! - That’s right, Nell! That’s right! You had to! - Well, as usual, you dumped the whole thing in my lap! - Because trying to reason with you is like standing in front of a bulldozer! No wonder our daughter takes drugs! - Are you saying that’s my fault? - Well, maybe it is. Oh...no, I didn’t mean that. - You did mean that. - Nell, I’m sorry. - I’m sorry, too. - Nell, where are you going? - I’m going to sleep downstairs. - Nell, don’t do that. Don’t be ridiculous. - Well, whatever you all think, Lucinda and I have noticed a big lapse in discipline lately, so this is going to be the policy from now on. - Yeah, right. - Ok, and on that note, Ms. Donna... You want to tell the house why you were two hours late on your day pass yesterday? - I told you. I missed my bus. - Next time, you miss both buses. - What, are you grounding me? - You got a discipline, and if you keep flapping your mouth, you’ll get two. - What do you think this is...Boot camp? - This whole house has an attitude this morning. What is going on here? - All right. From the gut... Show of hands. How many people here want to be here? How many need to be here? Phoebe? How about you? Good. Well, let’s get this day started. Woman’s group. - Hey, I’m Ramona. I’m your roommate. It’s going to get easier. Word. - I miss her. - I miss her, too. I never thought this would happen to our family. - Oh, well. Some things are out of our hands. - Hmm. At least we’ll be able to see her finally, day after tomorrow. - That place, with the... Therapist hanging on every word. - Does that mean you’re not going with me? - Should I come with you? - No, not if you have to ask. I’ll take care of it. - Fine. You take care of it. You go in and fix it. You always do. - Do you like it? - Mm-hmm. - ’cause I could exchange it. - No, don’t. It’s great, really. Mm-hmm. - You look good. You got some color back. - Are you talking about anyone in particular? - I’m talking about everyone in particular, but especially you. - Oh, hey! You’re phoebe’s mom, from the congress. - Yeah, we heard all about you. Ooh, that sweater is too cool. You bring this for Olivia? - Mm-hmm. - Phoebe, you got it made. My mother? I told her I’m checking in here. She punched my face. - How long have you been here? - Too long. - Who left dirty dishes all over the counter? - Excuse me. We are talking. - Oh, hi. I’m Ramona. Oh, you got to be phoebe’s mother. You look like each other. - No, we don’t. Do we? - Yes. I think so. How long have you been here, Ramona? - Six months and five days. - Is it working out? - I love it here. - You love it? - It’s better than what’s on the street. - You got that right. At least there’s nobody trying to kill you, just making you follow these rules day and night. - How did you all get here? - Bus. [Laughter] - Move your big feet. - Hi. I’m Tory. - Oh, hi, Tory. - I got hooked on crack trying to make it through grad school and hold down two day jobs. Day before midterms, I woke up in the emergency room. - My boyfriend beat me up when he found out I was pregnant, and I just had my hands like this, saying, "please, god, if you spare this baby, I swear I’ll get straight." - I’d been shunted around for a year. I knew I had to stop drugging, but I didn’t trust no one out on the street to look after my kid. - Was that true of all of you? - I had to go to nine programs before I found one that would take me pregnant. - You don’t know what it’s like out there. You just don’t know. - Senator Dietz got us an endorsement from his committee, and we’ve got a clear majority on the house subcommittee, so all things considered, we’re on top of our game with the reforestation bill. - Great. Oh, that’s great. - Charlie would have been proud. - Yeah. Yeah, he would have been. Well, listen. I have one more order of business. I’ve been doing some research here on drug treatment programs for pregnant women and women with babies. You know, there ought to be a place like family house in every town in the United States, but of course nobody’s got any funding. - So, what’s your proposal? - I want to go public with phoebe’s recovery. I want to call a press conference, do a TV segment, and educate people. - With all due respect, Nell, you’re out of your mind. - Am I? - Look, you tell the average voter you want to spend government money on drug-addict mothers, and he’s gonna say, "they should just lock them up and take their babies away." - And do what with them? These average voters want to adopt them? Or they want their taxes to pay for these babies’ foster care or their special ed classes or their jail sentences? And what about when these babies grow up, and their babies have drug problems? - That’s the way you see it because you’re involved. - Oh, wait, wait. Do you know that in this country 1 out of 10 babies is prenatally exposed to illicit drugs? - What about Phoebe? How does she feel? Did you ask her? - No, but I will. - Yes, but, Nell... - If people don’t come forward and talk about these problems, the stigma’s going to get worse, and the battle is just going to get harder. - She’s already written her speech. - You’re really determined to do this thing, aren’t you? - Yes! - All right. Now, this is going to help you calm your baby down when he’s hysterical. You’re going to cradle his head in one hand and his rear in the other. Ok, so his head is higher up than his feet, and you can make... - Eye contact. - Right. And you’re going to rock him gently, up and down. Not back and forth, that will just wire him more, up and down, vertical rocking. When your baby starts to quiet down, try adding some sound. You can talk, sing, just so long as you take it one step at a time. Drug babies are what they call hypersensitive. Now, we all know they’re hyper, right? But don’t forget sensitive. These kids understand you through your fingers, and you want them to understand that no matter what comes down, you’ll always be there for them. [Knock on door] Excuse me. Phoebe, can I see you in my office, please? Your mother’s here. - Aw, Phoebe, what’s she bringing you this time? - Take her? Thanks. You want me to go on TV and tell 5 million people I gave cocaine to my baby? - You’re taking this the wrong way. - I’m telling you how I feel. I don’t believe this! - Look, Phoebe, nobody’s going to do this TV piece unless you approve it. - I don’t! - Phoebe, how do you think things get done? People step forward. - Yeah, when they decide to, not when their mothers decide it’s political football! - Would you please just give this a chance? I know it’s not easy, but if you’ll just try, you’ll see how good you feel knowing your story is going to help somebody else. - I can’t think about anybody else right now. - Don’t be so selfish! - Selfish? Where do you think I learned that from, miss back-on-the-job six-days-later? - Listen to what she’s saying. - Every time you trot out that old story, do you know what I’m thinking? I had your attention for less than a week! I couldn’t compete with the supreme court! - You had my love and attention every day of your life! - Oh, if I did, then when did I start taking drugs, if you were paying so much attention? - I don’t want... - My 12th birthday! - What? - You remember that student assistant dad hired that fall? I came home from school early one day, and he was making dinner. He was smoking a joint. I cut a deal with him. I said, "I won’t bust you to daddy if you let me try it." He kept me in pot the whole time he lived with us. - Why didn’t you tell us? - Oh, come on, mother! Why do you think? I was getting away with it, and besides, you weren’t there! - So it’s my fault you started taking drugs? - Oh, I’m so sorry, mother. No, it’s my fault. Does that make you happy? Is that what you want to hear? My whole life is my fault! I mean, I’ve never accomplished anything, anyway, so I’ll just go on TV, and I’ll say, "hi, I’m Nell Harrington’s daughter, the drug addict!" How can you do this to me? - I’m not doing something to you. I’m trying to do something for you! - Well, then stop doing things for me! You can’t make decisions for me anymore. This is my recovery! It’s mine! You can’t even let me have this without taking over! - I’m not trying to take... - Well, you are, mother. What, you want to come in here with your cameras? You want to ruin what’s left of my life? You want to turn Olivia into a poster child? Fine! You go ahead. Do what you want. - Mrs. Harrington? I have to put phoebe’s needs first. - Alden, get me some studies on family incomes and college loans. - You got it. - I don’t know how such a dunce got to be a member of an education committee. - Nell? - Simon? - Simon. Wait a minute, Alden. What’s the matter? What’s the matter? - They called me at home. Phoebe’s dropped out of the program. - She has got to come back here. That’s all there is to it. - I hope she does, but the program is voluntary. Residents are responsible for their own actions. - All the ladies tried to talk her out of this. It hurts everyone when somebody leaves. - Now, there is a 24-hour grace period before we have to relinquish her spot to a new client, and Phoebe is aware of this. But if she doesn’t check in, we are legally bound to report Olivia’s status to the dcys. If it were any of our other clients, she’d probably lose custody, but we all know that the child welfare is not going to go after somebody with phoebe’s background... If she doesn’t endanger her baby. - I’ll get her back here. I know how to find her. - Phoebe used your intervention as a reason to drop out. If she’s looking for a reason to stay out, you’d be feeding right into it. - But...then what can I do? - Let her make her own mistakes, if she has to. You can’t do this for her. - I don’t have a daughter. I just don’t have a daughter now. - Yes, well... - We can’t just leave her out there. - You heard what that woman said. The best thing for Phoebe is not to pressure her. - I have to do something. - No, Nell, you don’t. You have to do nothing, for once in your life. - I’m just trying to solve this. - Who gave you this power? It’s not on your shoulders to solve everything. You just keep at it. And now look what’s happened. Look what you’ve done. - Whatever I’ve done, I’ve done because I love Phoebe. She is my child. I can’t bear the idea of her not being in my life. - You bear not having me in your life? ’cause that’s where we’re heading. I don’t know, Nell. I’ve been thinking I might want to go up to Cambridge and work on my book, take a place up there. - Well, you do what you have to do. - I’ll try, frank, but I really think you’re going to have to get somebody else. No, no, I’m fine. It’s just... I’m all right. She just... She hasn’t gotten a lot of sleep. [Baby crying] All right, all right. I’ll be there. You win. Ok. - And...arms out. Slowly up to fifth. Very pretty. And...breathe deeply. 2...3...4...5... 6...7...8. - Thanks, Mrs. Harrington, for getting family house into the proposal. When the bill passes, it’s going to help both our programs. - Well, you both deserve it. - I wish you’d consider taking a seat on our board of directors. - Oh, thank you, but I think this had better just be between us. - Down to the left... 2...3...4...5... 6...7...again. And 1...2... - Oh, this is brand-new. - Yeah. Holly, we’re out of clean diapers. - When was she born? - The day after Phoebe left. Adena Milagros. Have you heard from Phoebe? - No. Oh. Good luck with her. - 4...5...6... 7...8... And...1. Great. Have fun today. Bye. [Knock on door] - Mm-hmm. Come. - Simon? I’m going out. - Uh-huh. - I’m going to see Phoebe. - Oh...i see. - You still thinking about going up to Cambridge to finish your book? - Um...i was... I was actually thinking of going up to the lake house to work. It’s quieter up there. - Hmm... That’s good. I’ll be up in that neck of the woods when I start my senate campaign, so I guess I’ll see you up there. - But I thought that you weren’t running. - Hell, yes, I’m running. - Oh. Well, I’ll vote for you. - Good.

Sorry. I just wanted to come and see you and make sure you were all right. Phoebe, the last thing in the world I wanted to do was drive you away. - How did you think I was going to react? - I thought it would give you something. - No. - I’m sorry. - Me, too. - Guess I won’t do anything like that again. - You probably will. - I’ll work on it. I will try. You look good. Sound good, too. - Mom. - Hmm? - Follow me, hmm? Thank you. - You’re welcome. - Oh, look at this. Look at you. She’s beginning to look just like you and Charlie. - I know. - Hi, sweetie. Hello. - Mom... Mom, I need to tell you something. I broke down yesterday. I had my first drink. It was nothing much. It was just... A small glass of wine, but... It felt good. I got buzzed. All of a sudden, I couldn’t remember why I was supposed to be straight. I even started thinking I’ll just do one line. And the first one’s so fantastic. - But you didn’t. - No... Not this time, no. Next time, I would have. I’m going to check myself back into family house as soon as they have a bed open. - Good...good for you. - I want to try and end this. I want to end it. - Yeah. [Baby fusses] Oh, honey. Oh...oh, yes. Come here. Here we go. Shh, shh, shh. It’s all right. Who’s that? - Hi. - Who’s that? - Hey, you. What you looking? [Chuckles] You’re a good lady. And so are you. Yeah, you are. Bye, sweetheart. Phoeb... If you need a babysitter... - I got your number. - Right.
