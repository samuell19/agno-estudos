Did you see that? It's working! What brings you here, my good man? It's for you... The direction... There's a cutback. But I'm alone in this department. I have to deliver it to you in person. It's done! I got it in person. Are you satisfied? Get out of here before I take the top of your head off! Off with you! Get lost! One day, I'll be the one who fires you! And it's gonna make a lot of noise! Hi, uncle. Has anyone seen the bottle opener ? - I threw it. Lunch's ready! What is it? Boiled beef? You're not hungry or you're not in a mood? What's the luggage in the entrance for? Holidays! We're leaving tomorrow morning. You look surprised. Did you forget about it? Yes. And you, when are you taking some holidays? I already have. I was fired. What've you done? Chatting with my friends, keeping them from studying and always nagging the girls. Anyway, I decided not to work again. And not to eat either. Happy holidays. Maybe you should phone his job. No. I'll phone no-one. He can do what he wants. He always did, and that's always exasperated everybody. "Do you know Mandrin? Everybody's heard of this righter of wrongs, - who stole the riches to give to the paupers..." - It's not Mandrin, it's Karl Marx, silly! "...We'll learn that this legendary character left numerous corpses behind him and could be very cruel. A fascinating character, anyway..." Bastards!... Son of a bitch!... It's despicable to do that! Is there somebody playing hide-and-seek at the back?... I know where they are... I know where they are... Damn it! You turn me on... Did you have a nice trip, girls? Can you close the gate, please? Take care of the birdies. It was long! Hello, my uncle. It was hell. You don't know what hell is! "Please excuse us for this momentary break from our broadcasting." I was in the control room when it happened. She fell down all of a sudden, with her guts out of her body, as if... In brief, her belly exploded. Thank you. Ask the ballistics squad to come have a look. And I want to know everything about this announcer. - Did you tell her family? - I sent a telegram of condolence. You're in charge of the investigation? And you, who are you? Mrs Laure Frontenac, communication's secretary of state. Mr ...? Pleased to meet you. What have you heard? Was it your machine that made the sound? No, I remember... I heard this when she fell down... The primary report from the coroner. No projectile has been found. How's that? Let's go to the mortuary. I want a detailed report, tonight. I'll be at my office. At your orders. What number? 2. Did she kill herself or with the help of somebody? I've been doing autopsies for ten years and I've never seen this. - How can you explain it? - Ask my son. All I know is... she has a hole in her belly. I'm glad you're here, I wouldn't have noticed it without you! What kind of a hole? No gunpowder, no acid, no trace of anything. What do I write in my report? Natural death? It would look fishy. Has anyone figured out anything? Stop typing, would you? We could maybe take the cameras to pieces. Take the cameras to pieces? Sold! You take care of it. I've got to report to Mrs Something. - So long, boys. - Bye. Come in, it's open. What does it say in brief? - Not much. I need an explanation for tomorrow. The entire media is after me. Natural death. Are you kidding? She could've been attacked by a bunch of Martians on holiday. Is that one okay for you? Well... How about having a drink? That sounds like the thing to do. Yes, it's tasty. I'll tell him to come down, otherwise he's going to say it's cold again. What do you want? - We're having lunch. - Go ahead, I'm coming. Anyway, I'm sure it's already cold. What kind of wine is that? - It's a Bordeaux 1976. - "...We begin the TV news with a terrible accident that took the life of our colleague, Huguette Tranchet. Once again, the direction and staff of our channel wish to express our sympathy to the family of the victim. According to the communications secretary of state, the death was caused by an unexplained natural cause." It can't be a natural death. I saw it. I was watching TV. Can you hear me, you fool? It's not a natural death! Say it! Do your job! Why are they lying? - But uncle, I thought you hate announcers. - That's true. You always said she had a ugly face. It's settled, she's gone! Precisely, they have to say it! How she died. It's because they know nothing they have to talk nonsense! I can't believe that! And I'm not hungry. The meat is overcooked, L?a. Way overcooked. This kind of meat must be eaten rare. - Are you sulking? - I'm worried for your uncle. - As long as he doesn't bite... - If he keeps on acting like this, I'm the one who'll bite. I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes. The channel's CEO is waiting for you. Frontenac is also there, with two ministers. But before you meet them, it would be nice if you could say a word to the journalists - and announcers. They're in panic. - What can I say? That their job is now more dangerous than ours? - Mr Romain Pascot... - Yes, I know! Mr Pascot, this situation is intolerable. And I won't tolerate any laxity. - Can you explain to me what's so funny? - Nothing. Just the word "laxity". By the way, who's in charge of the investigation? - Mrs Frontenac told me.. - Yes... I thought this gentleman was in charge. He was there when I arrived. I'm here just because it's in my zone. Now if you want me to be in charge... I'm aware that Mrs Frontenac seems to trust you... The case is yours... For now. But be careful, no mistakes. All information given to the press must be approved by Mrs Frontenac, - and by myself... Is that clear? - Very clear, minister. I bet it's like yesterday. A big hole, guts everywhere and no projectile found. - Did you take the cameras to pieces? - Yes. But we didn't find anything. Here's the recording. Let's eat first, because after I'll probably not feel like it. Call Iceberg and tell him to deal with the ballistic squad. They have to calculate the trajectory and the projectile's speed. - But there's no projectile. - I know. But I want Iceberg to pretend there's one. I want to know from where he fired. From the top, from the bottom, from behind?... If we don't know with what he's firing, we still want to know from where he's doing it. I'm picking Julie up at the train station. I'll meet you at the office. I can count on you, right? You won't see well by the keyhole! I knocked... I was about to slip that under the door. Yes, of course... So you're spying on me? You want to search the uncle's room. And me, do I search your bedroom? - But I swear I... - You want to know what's inside this locked room, right? Do you want to see it? Then you just have to ask! End of the visit. Hey, my sweet, you look better than when you left. I have a surprise for you! Daddy, you really suck! Yes, but Mrs Louise has been sick for two days... She can't do miracles by working only two hours a week, anyway. All my clothes are dirty. How can I go to school tomorrow? - And what's this button for? - This, Miss, is to set the washing programme up... Daddy? Do you give credit? Are you out of your mind? I thought about something... Excuse me. Thank you. - Oh, you're back? - I have to go. I'll explain to you later. You choose the washing machine you want. You ask it to be delivered tomorrow and say I'll pay by cheque. - You're not upset, aren't you? - It won't be my fault if I don't choose the right one. - Of course not. Play it again in slow-motion. As slow as possible. Did you see the blue lightning? Play it again. Slowly... Stop. Ziggy, play the other tape at the same speed. Quickly! Did you see? There's a blue lightning before, each time. Sure there's a blue lightning! But it doesn't help us much. Hello, everybody. What's new? Listen... I did what you asked me to. But it's not easy to calculate a projectile's trajectory when there's no projectile! Anyway... On first look... According to the way the organs exploded, we could suppose it's coming from straight in front of them. So if we pretend there's a projectile, it's coming straight into their body. But it doesn't tell us what the projectile is. Don't worry... We're going to figure that out. Play it again. - You're up early. - I think I know how the killer's doing it. It's supposed to be murders, then? - So, how's he doing it? - He fires through the TV . Of course, why didn't I think about that! He fires through the TV! No projectile, the victims had no enemies, there's no phone demands, everything the victims ate before has been tested. Nothing found. All we know is the energy source that kills the victims comes from straight in front of them. Exactly from the camera's angle. And there's something else. I have a hunch... Last night, I saw a kid shooting at a TV set with a plastic gun. Each time he fired at the screen, an Indian fell from his horse. Listen, sheriff... Excuse me, my nerves... Your western story is a bit hard to buy. Do you have any other ideas? It's not more implausible than the theory of the natural death, after all. But it's far more frightening. - It would mean that... - The killer is somewhere in France, happily in front of his TV set. And there's 55 million suspects. Give me full permission to check out my theory. I have to speak to the minister. I can't take this kind of decisions on my own. I'll let you know. - I hope you're wrong. - Me too. "It's 8 a.m, I went to school. For the washing machine, I chose the more expensive one. By the way, I listened to the news, they said you're in charge of the dead TV people case, so please bring me an MTV t-shirt. Love." - Hello, birdies... - Hey, do you know what time it is?! Don't you have a job? Is Patrick up, at least? He didn't wake up. It happens... - Why're you upset like this? - I'M NOT UPSET! I just think you're two lazy fellows and I'm not used to having you under my feet at his hour... And I want to keep my routine! Are you going to get up, Patrick!? Do you think you're still on holiday!? A little cheque to start the day! 3450 francs... I thought we were going to share the bill. I'll pay you later. It's alright, there's no hurry. Are you sure you want to work? - Thank you. - Can I show you the way back? For the price this machine costs, it could be quieter. Silence is so nice! - Steak or brioche? - Steak. So, you saw him? I was sure he wouldn't understand. And I'd be taken off the case. Well... I've been glad to meet you. I'll bet it was bad news. Was it Olive? No. You're going to be disappointed: you won't have your t-shirt. I'm discharged from the case. - How lousy! On the contrary, it's not bad. I'd been a lousy father last night. Now I can redeem myself. So get dressed, I'll take you to eat anyplace you want. okay? You're great, daddy. You cunt... Such a cunt... Who's asking him? Boss, the communications girl. - Frontenac? - Yes, that's her. Bring the phone. Hello, Mrs Frontenac. How nice of you to call! A new murder? What a surprise! On channel 2? It's nice to have a change! Stop fooling around. They'll probably put you back on the case. I have to see you now. I'm waiting for you there. I'm not on this case anymore until I get a written notice on my desk. So if you want to see me, send me a summons or come to my office. I'm there from 10 to 12 and 2 to 7. - I've been a bit rude, haven't I? - With the chick - or with the administration? - You're a smart one, right? - I think about your future, boss. - You'd better think about your own future. Minister... I'd like to have a word with you. I need a beer. Hi. Any messages? Your work order. Signed by the minister. You're the only one in charge. You have full permission. Your extra expenses will be paid by my department. I'm sorry for before, but you have to understand me: they give me the case, then take it back from me... I only ask you one thing: if this bastard does exist, find him. Herv?, check all this out. - Mr Pascot, I'm the channel CEO, and I... - For the moment, this studio is under my staff's responsibility. Guy, call all the news editors and channel CEOs. - Mr Pascot... - It's all right... - Superintendent... - Quiet now! - Olive... - Yes. Get me all the information about the last murder. Blood and urine tests... everything you can get. - OK. And make me a list of all the known hackers, even the kids. Good evening, I'm superintendent Pascot. The TV studios are under police supervision. This is now a state matter and I'm in charge of it for the moment. You will put a recorder in each control room, it is going to record the direct broadcasts and play them on air with a two second delay. And can we know what the point of all this is? I have no explanation to give you. It's 11 pm now, just do it. From tomorrow morning, I don't want anyone to speak on air on any channel. There will be no more murders on TV. Goodbye. Olive. - Yes. Summon all the people on that list. - For when? - As soon as possible. Ask them to come with their luggage, they're going to stay for a few days. Warren Trevor, Dr Tchaikowsky... who are these people? - Some big shots. - Is that so? Because some of them have really complicated names... Hoodenbach, Stevinson... I won't find that in the phone book! Say... Why don't we ask Mrs Solange to come? - Who's that? - A fortune-teller. She's a big shot. Even Reagan consults her. Sold. Dear Madam, the brightest one is thanking you. Do you know Pascot, from the homicide squad? - I've heard of him. - I want you to watch him. If his theory is correct and he can arrest a suspect, I want to know it that very minute. Who knows about this... mission? - You and my chief of cabinet. - What about Frontenac? - No. - Be discreet. - You can count on me. - Recorder to control room, we're ready. - We can start, now. Go ahead, send your text. You apply this system in all your control rooms, OK? We're dealing with the other channels. - Do I put the siren? - Yes, and fasten your seat belt. Damn it, quickly! The others did it in 15 seconds! It's not my fault if the connections are screwed-up! You should already be happy we're here. - That's not my shift. - Come on, quickly! No need to make a mountain out of a molehill... It's fixed. Control room to recorder. Do you get the final picture? Negative. Still nothing. Jesus! What're you waiting for? Nobody's going to miss you. You have ten seconds! Bastards! Bunch of assholes! Thank you, sir. Please follow the young lady. I'm sent by the department to help you out. It's most welcome! Just follow the chick! - Keep your eyes open. - Yes, don't worry. - How are you? - Fine. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. We're thanking you for answering to our call. We have a situation. A series of identical murders that occurred on direct television. Three murders to date. We have them recorded. The shallow clues we've got... make us think that someone, in his home... has created a system... that allows him to kill... by firing on the TV screen. You're the greatest specialists in physiology, psychology, electronics... The first question is... to know if this theory is possible? The second is... how to locate the murderer? That's it... Any questions? How much time do we have? Three days. - Please, sir... - Yes. I'd like to know if you could install a coffee machine? No problem. You can stop the live broadcasting but you won't stop me that easily. It's a magneto generator. It's like a big magnet. [Serial killings] You'll see, sugar, I'm going to impress you again. It's disconnected again. Did you put the set camera on? I didn't touch anything. What's that shit? Call the nodal. Control room to nodal. What did they say? They don't know. It's not coming from them. Did you see that? The camera turned on by itself. Broadcasting to control room. What do you have on screen? Switch quickly. What's that nonsense? Superintendent Pascot. You told me there'll be no more murders. Not only are there more anyway, but you're spending a lot of money on top of that! And you've made a mess of all the channels! Therefore, I discharge you. Good idea. And who's going to be in charge, then? Philippe Bouvard or Jacques Martin? (French TV comics) Dr Samrat, physicist, Dr Trevor, from Cambridge, communications specialist. Mr... - Dr Heckman, from Stockholm spatial research center. Can we have five minutes of your time, minister? First question: can someone, from his home, and through the waves kill announcers who're speaking live on TV? The answer is yes. Second question: the person we're dealing with has substituted the Hertzian network for a highly concentrated microwave network... This network comes through the TV camera and blows, from the inside, the guts of the victim? At this point, the best thing to do is to show you directly. We've recreated a biological replica of the human body. It has the same density and the same acoustic impedance... Look. Is that clear enough, minister? - Can you determine from where he's firing? - It's very difficult. The only moment we can locate him is precisely when he's firing. The signal he produces goes from his TV set to the TV camera. If at this moment, we could manage to send an equal ultrasound wave, it would ride back to the murderer's receiver. It would probably destroy his system and, hopefully, him himself. So we'll have to fire at the same time as him? To be perfectly accurate, we'd have to fire a fraction of second before him. Therefore, we'd have to know the moment he'd fire, or make him fire at a moment determined by us. I'll let Dr. Trevor speak now. Warren Trevor, psychiatrist. In these 300 pages, we've tried to re-enact an identikit of the killer. One of the information we now have about him seems to be very interesting. There is 69% probability that this man never turns off his TV set. Even when broadcasting is over. We're going to set up a computer generated speech, that'll encourage the murderer to fire at a determined moment. What would happen if some other viewers are watching TV? We'll broadcast only between 3:58 and 4:16, when the audience ratings are at their lower point: 0,3%. Excuse-me, but it's 0,03%. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. We can be ready in 24 hours but in view of the risks, the decision must be taken by you, minister. I'm afraid we don't have a better option. I accept your decision. Thank you, gentlemen. - Who's going to read the speech? - The computer will decide that. Goodbye, superintendent. Are you coming with me or shall I give you the address? - Excuse-me? - You don't seem to phone your daughter often. How do you know, Julie? I called you at home at noon, a lovable kid answered and I invited her for dinner. With or without you, she'll be at my home at 8 pm. - But it's 9:30 already. - Precisely, hurry up. See? She's part of the 0,03%. - Excuse-me? - Do you like salmon? I'm not very found of it, actually. Are you waiting for somebody? - No. - Do you always have Champagne ready in your kitchen? - No. Not always. - Do you want to get me drunk? - Why not? - Is it good? - Frankly, not so much. You could try to be gallant. It's the first time I've made pasta for a superintendent. - What do you usually cook? - Salmon. Sure, but I don't like salmon. There's a fire on the TV set. I'm sure that's our man. I don't know how he did it, - but he managed to set a fire. - Any wounded people? Yes, three. We have to do our broadcasting tonight. Tonight! This guy is really too smart! We don't know what he could come up with by tomorrow. We have to do it tonight! I don't give a shit! They have to sort it out! Wait for us. I asked them to connect the computers. The speech will be ready in half an hour. I'll get this bastard. I'll wear them down. They don't know where I am but I know where they are. I already had a leg up, but one day I'll get rid of all of them! The meat is overcooked in this house... You're the best looking of them all, my uncle! Have a drink... - You'll be home late? - Probably. Don't worry. We won't have the time for a double check with the computer. Never mind. There's a backward meter here and another one above camera 1. When the meter points to zero, the announcer will move aside and we'll fire at the camera lens. That's a teleprompter. It gives the announcer the text he has to deliver. Now, what text and who's going to say it? The text is coming. And I'm the announcer. Mr Pascot, it's out of the question that you're doing it. - You don't fit the profile at all. - According to the computer, the speech must be delivered by a measured and sensitive person able to both touch and interest the subject. In brief, we need a woman. The computer already picked one. It can be only you, Mrs. You'll have one second after we fire to switch on this camera, fitted with the ultrasound system. - Is that clear? - What do I do if that lunatic - fires too early or too late? - He's going to fire at the predicted time. The one who woke me up... is going to feel sorry. 47, 46, 45... 39, 38, 37... We'll be on air in 30 seconds. Don't shoot... Don't shoot. I know you can kill me if you want to, but please listen to me for five minutes, after that you can do what you want. You're a remarkable scientist, a mastermind inventor, but nobody probably ever understood your work and supported you. But you've convinced me... We needed several of the greatest worldwide scientists to understand what you've created on your own. They've asked me to tell you how they admire yo... Everybody has agreed to say you're one the greatest minds of our time. That's why I don't understand your behaviour... If society hurt you so badly... Then you should fire at me because tonight I represent society. If it's not vengeance but only a power demonstration, then it's ridiculous. - Please, my uncle, stop this! - Shut up! I have some unfinished business. ...I'd like to meet you... Albert, it's no use! - Listen to me! - Stop it! I can't hear what she said! For once someone is talking to me! Only to me. My uncle, I'm here and I love you, don't do it... - Albert! - Are you going to shut your fucking mouth! L?a? What's going on? It's him who kills the people on TV! I beg of you, open the door... ...I think a man like you deserves respect... -...your cynical and gratuitous behaviour... - Shut up, now... Shut up. I'm only asking you to let me help you. Don't miss the chance to get out of this with dignity. Your genius is spoiled by your actions. What a waste! How can you tolerate such a miserable end, with the talent you have? You must control this madness inside you. You're a scientist, not a kamikaze, - and the worst is... - You're wrong, I am a kamikaze. ...because it's turning against you... You're as dumb as the others! As soon as you enter in this picture box, you all become ridiculous. ...you're doing evil right now because you feel lonely. You'll stay lonely forever. You better talk to my hand... But, maybe you won't listen to me, maybe you're just one more lunatic... who's going to kill me, now. Because it's rising inside you and you can't control yourself... Can you see me? Or is the sun keeping you from seeing? Do you think you're God? Have you been touched by the divine grace? Do you think you can dispose of people's life? Say... If you know everything, do you know how many thousands of years it took before you stopped eating with your fingers, asshole?! Asshole! We're going to do just like in the old movies... I'm going to be as dumb as you. The one who kills first wins. That's the point, isn't it? If it's you, nobody's going to know it was you... Until the day someone else would like to know... Go ahead, shoot! Shoot! Kill me! Jesus Christ, shoot! It's easy, isn't it? You're hiding in your place, like a big worm... Look at this mess! Bastard! Kamikaze... But no hara-kiri! Between 3:40 and 4:20, there has been 847 electric over-consumption points. - It's above average. - We analyzed the blast wave, and considering its spreading speed and its response time, the centre of emission can't be over 50 kms from here. Well... Draw a 50-km circle around Paris. - Is Meaux 50 kms of Paris ? - Pretty much. - There's at least 150 left. - His place has been damaged for sure... Short circuit, fire, wounded people, anything... Guy, get me all the police reports about incidents between 3 and 5 a.m. For all areas. When you get the reports, you connect them with the points on the map. We'll see how many are left. It's going to take forever! What do you think? That's not the scientific method but your instinct is sometimes so... puzzling. Of course, they were often arguing, but how could I have imagined... - Did you know he had a gun? - Of course not. You know, they had their life and I had mine. A man of my age... I used to stay upstairs. They were so nice to give me shelter, I didn't want to disturb them. - How terrible... - Cigarette? - Are you going to be okay? - Yes, of course. - Do you need someone? - It's going to be alright. I'll go sleep for a moment... 58... It makes 20 each, guys. Come on, let's go. Let's go, for Christ's sake! Olive, you keep the house! - Can we have breakfast? - Would be easier to work after. Okay, sold... Pelletier, you stay here. Tell your insurance to send us the report. Guy and Herv?, do you hear me? - Yes, Guy speaking. Nothing to report, imploded TVs, a power cut in a butcher shop... - Any news from Herv?? - No, I spoke to him five minutes ago, - he's no luckier than me. - Okay, just carry on. [Superintendent R. Pascot] - Hello, is the MTV t-shirt for you? - Yes, I'll take it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, thanks a lot. Olive, can you hear me? Mercier, telephone for you. Thanks... Hello. Do you still have the hackers list you've done? - Yes, I have it somewhere. - Then try to match it with the 58-point list. - It's going to take for ever! - You've got ten minutes! - Yes? - Boss, there's about ten places. Give me the first three and the rest to Herv? and Guy. - Okay, where are you? - West of Paris. - I don't buy anything, don't waste your time! - Police, may I come in? Excuse me, but all these stories gave my nerves a hard time. - Are you on your way out? - Yes... I need some fresh air. - Here, the atmosphere became heavy. - He was your nephew? Yes. It's dreadful... I guess you need to speak to me... That's the living room... It's a mess because they had a party yesterday. They drank too much in my opinion. All the guests left at around 3 a.m. - And you, where were you? - Me? I was here. - And also upstairs, in my room. - When they left, I'm sure I was in bed. - Did you hear the gunshots from upstairs? - From my room, yes. You know I sleep lightly. What happened? The storm, I guess... What do you think? What do I think? To make a TV implode, it has to be turned on. And at 3 a.m., the broadcasts are long past over. They probably fell asleep before turning it off... It happens to me quite often... - They fell down from here? - Yes. - Why did they go up to have a row? - I don't know. They maybe started it downstairs: bing, I slap you, "Take this, bitch!", "You're going to feel sorry for that, sucker", she takes her suitcase, the door slams, "I'm going to kill you", "My uncle, help me!", she climbs the staircase, he brutally catches her, she opens the window to ask for help, and blam, bang, the window, and... the ground... What a tragedy! Yes... - That's my room. - You don't have TV? - No. - I thought you often fall asleep while watching TV. During holidays... They once left home for three months so I took the TV to my room. - Well. Anything else? - No. Nothing... - And what's this? A closet? - Yes. My closet. - Can I see? - Nobody can. Excuse me? Then only a quick look. End of the visit. What's this? A bottle opener. - You're a scientist? - Yes... Not a kamikaze. Can I show you the way out? - Yes? - Olive. - Yes, boss? - I got him. The first address, send a car. Great! He caught him. Let's take my car. I'm just across the street. Why all this? They thought I was good for nothing. I wanted to show them... I didn't like this company... It's no fun to get fired, you know? They told you: "Go away, off with you!", with my prizes... After 30 years... - What's the connection with TV? - There's no connection. You're the one who needs to make connections, not me... All these announcers are so irritating with their awful smiles... their bright teeth... Especially the fat brunette, with her high-pitched voice! She was unbearable and ugly... Don't you think? Frankly... Just between the two of us. Yes. See?! I was happily on holidays and then I had to listen to her bullshit for hours and days... So... I fired her. How did you think this little game would end? Badly... I've never been lucky in any games... Even when I was a kid, I lost all the time. I was cheating when playing Monopoly with my brother, but he always won. He was maybe a better cheater than you. - You cheated, too. - How's that? You're not going to pretend that you found out the system all by yourself? Some people helped you. Say it! How many were you? About 50. 50! 50! For a poor old man like me! Isn't that cheating? Stay here, kid! You watch him. What's the name of the pretty lady who was in charge of everything? - Mrs Frontenac. - Yes... What's her first name? - Laure. Laure... It's a pretty name, Laure... Please send her my regards. Don't move, superintendent! Reason of state. I'm sorry. Me too. Motherfuckers! Boss... Your t-shirt. Translation and timing: Aquasantajoe For Cinemageddon April, 5th 2009
