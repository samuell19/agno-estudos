(MultiCom Jingle) (train whistle blowing) (orchestra tuning) - [Man] One, two, three. ("America the Beautiful" instrumental) (chattering) - Gotta have right notes and we gotta get all the notes in there. Back to the top, don't swing it. ("America the Beautiful" instrumental) - Hey. Let's stop. - Okay. - I think I'm getting a sunstroke. I just saw a mirage of a frosty root beer. (laughs) - Alright. My baton is so hot it's bending. - What's so great about Chicago anyway? - It's not Halstead. - And if I don't get the scholarship? - You'll come live with me in San Francisco. - San Francisco? - Or downtown Persia or New York City. Or anywhere! I'm getting out of Halstead. We both are. You wait and see. - I'm waitin'. (cows mooing) - Hi. - Hi. You need a ride home? - Oh no thanks Andy, I have the car today. I went to see Matt at the prison. Whew. (laughing awkwardly) - I hope you like sour cream. - Why? - If it doesn't cool down tonight we have a dairy full of it tomorrow. (laughing) (cows mooing) - Go on. (marching band music) - Oh damn it to hell! Bad day, Lord. Oh. - You said you were going home. Now go home. - Battle of the Bulge, idiot. You know what the Battle of the Bulge was, don't you Hottie? - Hmph. If it wasn't part of the Civil War, it's not one of my priorities. Now get outta here. I'm tired, I wanna lock up. You gettin' too old for this kinda nonsense anyhow. - Ha, you said it! If anybody told me I'd be 66 and still sitting here grading papers for summer session I'd have had a good laugh. But go on, go on, I'll lock up. (sighs) - [Child] Wait! - Thank you. Thought you were on a diet, Officer Chibbs. - Just gettin' a quick cup of ice, Aggie. Fancy twirling you girls did out there just now. Hope one of you wins. - You that nervous? You just ate a chunk of the paper. - Did not. - Hold on five more minutes, we'll know who won. - I never won anything in my whole life. I was the only kid at brownie scouts who never won a single bingo game, okay? I don't think I'll ever win anything. - Hey, too hot to get so riled. Wait, something the matter? - Nothing. - Your art scholarship. (huffs) You didn't win it? - They said June 1st, okay? They promised I'd hear by then. It's what, almost July? I'll be stuck in Halstead the rest of my life is what'll happen. I won't win the scholarship. - The heat goes up and everybody gets nuts. - Maybe they're just late, huh? Maybe I still got a chance. - I never met anybody who could paint like you. Or anybody who could twirl like you. You make great grades, you got a terrific boyfriend. I like have none of the above, okay? I'm the one who should be mad. (chuckles) (squeals) - Jeff, you freak! - Yuck. Too hot to say hello like that. - Beautiful evening Officer Chibbs. - It was. - Hey Jeff. Come on, we're gonna miss the announcements. - Don't you wanna hear who won the twirling contest? (laughing) - No. Let's go! - Who is it? Is it you, Tilda? - [Rachel] It's me, Mama. - Ah. I was all set to launch into Tilda about leaving her paints all over kingdom come. - She probably just forgot. - Yeah well she also forgot to stake the tomatoes. Or clean up the attic like she promised. You spoil that child silly. - Uh huh. - I know I've said this before but I'm saying it again. You don't have to be this tired. Andy offered you a very nice job. In an office. But no, you just love to work your fingers to the bones. - Can't talk to an adding machine, Mama. - Oh of course, cows are brilliant conversationalists. - You know what I mean. I'd go crazy sitting behind a desk all day. - You wouldn't have to take any job, office or otherwise. Just have done with it and marry the man. Here we are, three women. Slaving like stevedores. He proposed to you! Gentleman, wealthy, solid-- - That's enough, Mama. - Oh look, you made me chop enough cucumbers to open a facial boutique. Well, am I gonna have to drag it out of you? - What? - Oh. The prison! Did you go or didn't you? - I did. - And? Are they gonna parole Matt, lord help him? - Could be quite a while still. - The distortion of all those lies. In the centerpiece we have a coward who is afraid to speak up in his own defense. And now we're supposed to think of him as some kind of a hero? - Stop it, Mama. He did turn state's evidence against Crow. - Oh, great. Now that Crow's dead he's finally gonna tell the truth. But he should have done it years ago. - He was protecting us, Mama. Crow threatened to kill Matt, he coulda harmed us too. - The law is supposed to protect us. What kind of a law is it that lets Matt sit around in jail with Crow running around free as a bird? What kind of justice is that? - Crow got his justice, Mama. He's dead now, leave him alone. - 10 car wrecks wouldn't be punishment enough for that mutant. Oh, cover your ears, lord. Will you go sit down? You look terrible. (dogs barking) So how was he? - He was fine, I guess. Passed all his tests as a mechanic. - Oh well that'll be nice. For him in jail. - For when he gets out, Mama. - If he gets out, you mean. - He can work all kinds of machines. - Oh bank vaults, cash registers. - That's a lousy joke, Mama. - Oh it's no fun if you don't get mad. - [Rachel] That's why I don't. - Oh you're mean. Won't let me have my little pleasure, it's just mean. Anyway, robbing is better than murdering. - Damnit Mama, Crow was the killer. Matt never hurt a soul in his life. (laughs and snorts) - I got you mad. I did. - Baby, what happened, what's the matter? - Mama, Grandma, I won! Me! I won over Patty Francis and Cindy Snyder and all of 'em! It's gonna be me who gets to lead the parade. - Baby, that's wonderful, that's... Congratulations! I told you you could do it. - When they called out my name I was so surprised I just froze. - Ah well, you practice so much with that thing you shoulda won. You don't stake the tomatoes, you don't clean the attic, but you do practice til two in the morning, in the dark. - [Rachel] Mama, you could have gone all night without saying that. - Well somebody around here has to set the discipline. - Baby you been keeping your promise, haven't you? You didn't go out with Jeff? - No, I was out with a whole gang of creeps. We all got plastered on rotgut. We shot up with heroin. We topped off the evening by having sex with everybody in the crowd. - Oh a night like any other. I don't know about you but I am gonna touch rubber so I won't fry when the lightning strikes. - Honey, we just want you to call if you're out past midnight, okay? - So great, when I do you tell me to come right home. - Well what can you do til two o'clock in the morning that you haven't done by midnight? (light music) - Look I'm tired, you know? So I'll see you in the morning, alright? - Saw your dad today. (sighs) - So? - Well so he asked about you. (pensive music) - Oh. - Might be up for parole now that he's testified against Crow. - When? - Could be soon. Doesn't understand why you haven't been to see him. - So like congratulations to me, huh? Big leader of the parade. (uplifting music) (train whistle blowing) - Rachel? - Matt? Matt! Matt! (music swelling) Oh! - Oh darling. Rachel, let me look at you. (soft music) You know sometimes when you'd leave on visiting days I'd start to think you weren't real. That I'd made you up like a dream. - Touch me. - Oh Rachel. Oh darling. I missed you so much. - Hey, hey how come you're getting your mail here? What, you got a secret loverboy in Chicago? I'll give it to you only if you go out with me. - You need to give me a raise. Alright two chocolate shakes, two pies, two fries, two hamburgers, and two onion rings. Get that? - Hi. - Hi, where have you been? We're swamped. - I just went past your house. - Yeah? - I can't tell you here. - What? Tell me! - Your father's home. - What? (sighs) Oh my god. - I'll cover for you. (tense music) - Mm. You know the only bad thing about prison was we never had enough Brussels sprouts. (laughs) - Everything's changed like crazy since you were here, Matt. Lots more jobs than there use to be. There's that new farm machinery shop on Route 12. The Halstead Machine Shop, Wally's Tool and Die-- - All just dying for Matt to become president of the company? (chuckles) - Well it seems some things never change though, do they? - Well she's trying to give you the impression it's gonna be easy. - I'm not! Of course it's gonna be hard. But if we all pitch in! You see people at the church all the time Mama and at school you just let them know he's available. And Tilda? - What can I do? I barely got my own job. - Hey it's alright, hold it everybody. Just stop the music. See I don't need anyone to help me. If I do, I know you'll all be glad to help but I won't need it. You see, I'm so happy to be on the outside I can't help but make it this time. Don't worry, I'll get a job. I'll learn as much about it as I can and then I'll get another job, a better one. And pretty soon, with a few breaks, god willing, I'll be a success. And who knows, Miss Sarah, maybe I will be the president of some company. - Well how about let's just see you start with one real paycheck. (chuckles) - He will Mama, he will. Okay, close your eyes everybody. Close 'em! - Close your eyes. (light music) - Alright. Okay, open. One candle for each year we missed. - Oh honey. - Ready? (blows) (train whistle blowing) - Tilda. Trains keeping you up? - I guess. - Yeah. Me too. Sure like to hear 'em though. Don't you? You know. Hardly said a word to me Tilda since I been home. - So? - Just wanted to tell you I understand why you quit coming to visit me. I don't blame you. (scoffs) - What's that supposed to mean? - It means I know it's not the easiest thing in the world being the daughter of a jailbird. - How can you know? You don't see how we get treated around here. People either pitying me or rubbing it in. I get blackballed from girl's club. Not invited to parties. I wanna know what's fair about that! What did I ever do? - Tilda. I wish I could change all the bad things that happened to you. I wish to God I could do that. What you got there? Letter from the president congratulating me on getting home? (chuckles) (soft music) - It's this, you know, a form letter. I applied to the art institute in Chicago for a scholarship. - Chicago? Well that's terrific. What'd they say? - Too many entries or something. Says I have to wait another week. - Oh yeah, tired of waiting. - It's just I want this so much. I gotta get outta here. - Is it because you hate Halstead so much or just got bigger fish to fry? - I like it, it's just I know everything about it. I know Mom will watch the seven o'clock news at seven o'clock. The drugist'll look down my dress and say, "My my, what a growing girl you are." - What does your mother think about the Chicago deal? - It's her eleventh commandment. Thou shalt not leave home. - See, that's because she thinks maybe she made a big mistake one time. Running away from home with me. - Well if she hadn't I wouldn't even be here, right? - You've got a point there. You know what was the worst thing about prison for me? It wasn't being shut in, it was being shut out. Shut out of you and your mama's life. What I mean is now that I'm home I hope I won't be shut out any more, Tilda. (light music) (murmuring) - What a lovely party! - Oh, thank you. - My entire sewing bee are out there. Everybody from the church, my ladies from the oak forest club committee. Rachel, for heaven's sake! You've got a whole yard of badges out there to consider. - See Mama? You said nobody'd show up. I told you they'd all be so curious to stare at the convict they'd get crushed in the stampede. - I still think it's a dumb idea for a party. - I say let 'em goggle at him today and give him a job tomorrow. - Rachel, how many bottles of wine have you poured in there? You want everybody to get drunk? - I want 'em all to get smashed, Mama, delightfully smashed. - I think you're a little smashed yourself. You've been swilling that punch. - Just drunk with happiness, Mama. I'm so glad he's home I can't stand it! I want everybody to be happy, I want 'em all to be punch-drunk, the whole world. I want 'em to get drunk on their a-- - Oh Rachel, the good lord doesn't like words like that. - Then he shouldn't use 'em. (laughs) (trumpet blowing) What was that? - It's probably the angel Gabriel come to tell you the good lord thinks the punch is spiked enough. - What is that trumpet doing here? I told you it wasn't invited to this party. - I need all the practice I can do, Papa. - Not if it burst the eardrums of everyone! - But Papa, they won't let me be in the parade if I can't play loud. (trumpet blowing) - Mitchie! - Did anyone ever give you a real hard frog on the arm? - Yes ma'am. - I take it you wouldn't wanna get another one any too soon. - No ma'am. - Good boy. - Hi Sam, hiya. - 20 to two he'll be back in jail before Christmas, Eddie. - Have to give me better odds than that. Evening Miss Hottie. Kinda hot tonight. - Yeah. Especially a lot of hot air right around the two of you. - Nice. - Andy! It's about time you two met. My husband and my boss. Matt, this is Andy Janacek, he's the foreman at the dairy. - How do you do? Nice to meet you. - Matt. - Are you the boss of the party, Rachel? - Well I guess you might say. - Nobody lets me play my trumpet. - Aw. I think I know just the thing for you to play. - Where is it? - Come with me! - [Andy] He's really in love with her. - Smart boy. - So am I. - You too? Well. - Yeah. I want to say it once and for all, then forget about it. At least twice a year I've asked Rachel to marry me. - Well damn. Looks like I got home in the nick of time. - No. There was never any emergency. (chuckles) (harmonica music) - Rachel. - What's he doing here? - Who's that? - Tilda, did you invite Jeff? - Yes. - I specifically asked you not to invite him! - Well I did Mom, let go. - Let her go. Who's that, what's the matter with him? - Everything! He's the worst kind of lowlife. He's a hoodlum, a gambler-- - Just because he works at the roadhouse Mom doesn't make him a gambler. It's not illegal anyway, half the people at this party go there. - Hi folks. How's it going? - Jeff you were not invited to this party. I would appreciate it if you'd leave now. - Mom. - I thought I was invited. - I would also appreciate it if you'd stop seeing my daughter, is that clear? - Your daughter is past 18, Mrs. Kirby. She can do as she pleases. - Wanna dance Jeff? - No, I want him to leave now! - Did you hear what Mrs. Kirby said? She wants you to leave. I'm Tilda's father. - Welcome home, Mr. Kirby. - Thanks. Better beat it, kid. - You heard him. - Mom, stop it! - Don't worry, Mrs. Kirby. I'm leaving. (scoffs) - You are so crude Mom, I can't believe it. I'm going after him. - Go on, who's stopping you? If you wanna go after him, go after him. - Are you out of your mind? - It's up to you, honey. - I don't need your advice. - Good, then don't take it! - And I don't want you on my side or his! - Yeah hate to give him a bad name. - He already has a bad name. - Only to you! He's never done anything wrong, Mom! He's never committed a crime and he's never been to jail. Don't try to help me anymore, okay? I got along just fine without you. (train whistle blowing) - [Glen] You been down to Joe Medina's shop yet? - [Matt] Yeah. It's full up. - I could call Wally's Tool and Die for you. - I've already been there. (sighs) - I'd help you if I could, Matt. But like I said, we're union of course so it's a closed shop. I'd catch hell if I hired a non-union man. - Yeah, right. Union says someone has to hire me before I can join the union. It's a-- - Bitch of a circle. (sighs) Hard to find a chink in the armor. - I'll say. (tense music) Well, take care. Thanks Glen. - Yeah. - See ya Dan. - See ya. (chattering) - Hey Sam, any of these master carpenters need an apprentice? - Oh Matt. - How you doing? - Hi. What'd you say? - Well I just wondered if any of these men here needed a boy to hold a can of nails for him. - Gosh Matt, they're only high school kids. Work for 2.50 an hour. - Yeah? I don't need the money, just thought it might be something to do. - Well I can always use help if you want. - Nah nah, thanks Sam. I'd probably trip over the can of nails anyway. See ya. Hey buddy. Why aren't you back there with the band? - They don't think I play good. - No. You think maybe they've forgotten how they sounded when they first started playing? - I think it's just my lungs are small for my age. - I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Come on hot lips, let's go get us a lemonade, take the edge off the day. What do you say? - Come on girls, you're late. - Back off you drone. - I got another letter from your secret loverboy in Chicago. The next letter that comes in here goes in the garbage disposal. - Don't let him get to you, Tilda. I mean anybody who thinks Sid Vicious is a fun guy. Forget it. What's the matter? - It's my scholarship results. (tense music) - You'll find another way Til, I know it. - Heard about a guy once who was making cookies with his wife. - Mm hmm? - He thought they were so yummy he thought why not sell 'em? Now he owns a giant cookie factory. - I don't see you as king of a cookie factory. - Hmm. Then there was another guy who was a carpenter, made wooden coathangers. Got his little boy to sell 'em door to door. Now he's running a big woodworking shop. Worth more than a million dollars. - Is that what you want, a woodworking shop? (chuckles wryly) - Not especially. But I wouldn't mind the million bucks. I know, why don't I get a job? - Why don't you just ask him? Dairy needs a good mechanic in the machine shop. - Nope. - Please Matt. - I'm not gonna go begging your boyfriend for a job. - You won't be begging and Andy's not my boyfriend. - I know, he told me. Said he proposed to you at least twice every year. Well I can't blame him for that. Nobody's fool. And I can't blame you if you took a shine to him either. Seems like a nice guy. - He is a nice guy. And he's attractive and he's in love with me. It's not worth a turnip 'cause I'm in love with you so forget it. - Forget what? (chuckles) - So you'll talk to him? - No. - Why are you so pigheaded? - Because people been telling me what to do for a long time now. Now I think I got the right to make up my own mind about some things. - Course you do. (light guitar music) - You deal from the bottom of the deck on more time and I'm gonna knock you so hard you'll be dealing from way down under. - Get your hands off me. - Same thing as last week. Cheating, just like-- - Gentlemen, excuse me. I told you never to come here. - I know, I... (gentle country music) - What are you doing here? - Why are you talking to me that way? I just found out I lost the scholarship. And I feel like I'm losing you too. I dunno, everything's falling apart. - Sorry about the scholarship. But I don't know what else to say. - Sorry about last night. I should have followed you. - If your family doesn't think I'm good enough for 'em-- - You are good enough. Who am I, the daughter of the president? - Your father being what he is, your mother's gonna be even tougher on guys like me, okay? So I say to hell with her. And to hell with the whole thing. - You don't mean that. - Go home Tilda, don't get yourself in trouble, okay? - I am in trouble, I'm in love with you! - I'm going back to work. - How can you walk away from me when I tell you I love you? - Because I don't hear you! - Then listen to me when I say it, listen to me! I love you! - Go home, will you? - Stop protecting me! Stop treating me as if I'm breakable, I'm not! (sobbing) Please hold me, please. I love you, please hold me. (gentle music) - Stop it. - Of course I'm sure it was Tilda. It was the same hair, the same hips, the same... Well the same everything. - I saw her too, clear as day. - Just like you were so sure it was Reverend Wilson at the house of you know what? - I've had my glasses fixed since then. I know what I'm seeing. - Well supposing it was Tilda. So what? - So what? What was she doing at the roadhouse? - And just what were you doing at the roadhouse? - Right! If it's so illegal for Tilda, why isn't it illegal for you? - Why we were there to see that no other church members were out there, weren't we? - Anyway, we were there with our husbands. - And that makes you respectable. (laughs) Does it? - Of course we're respectable. - Hmph. Well then so is her Tilda. - Anywhere there are watermelons there's likely to be a thumper. (laughs) How do you tell they're ripe? Some swear by thumping. Some scratch 'em with a fingernail, some check the color of the curl. Sarah. Would you like some coffee? - No, I'm nervous enough as it is. - How's the new minister, Mama? - I can't stand him! He gossips with God instead of praying to him. - Gossips, huh? - Yes. He tells the good lord all the nasty little things we do. Things the almighty wouldn't even hear about if the minister would just keep his mouth shut. - Like what, Mama? - Like what our children are doing in the night time. - You saying the minister said something about Tilda? - Well if he did he wouldn't be the only one. Yesterday I heard it at my float committee. Today the congregation's jaws were flapping. By tomorrow, we'll hear it in the Belgian Congo. - Heard what? - The Hortons and the Wallaces saw Tilda at the roadhouse. - I don't believe it. - Well I do, I heard her coming in at three o'clock in the morning. - Thought she said she was going out with Aggie. (chuckles) - We know who she was out with alright. - Who is this boy? - I'll tell you who. Somebody who'd be right at home with you over in the prison house. - Here we go again. Goodbye girls, I'm taking a walk. - Mama, do you have to make things harder on him than they already are? - I'm just speaking my mind. I'm about ready for him to get a job too. Supporting ourselves is bad enough. Now another hungry mouth to feed. - He'll get a job, Mama! Can't you be a little kinder to him? - I'm as kind to him as he deserves. - Oh god! - Don't blaspheme! - Why is it when I say God's name it's blasphemous and when you say it it's praying? - Because I love God! - No you don't, you only fear him. - I can do both at the same time. - No you can't. - Are you going to do something about Tilda and that boy or not? - I just pray she wins that scholarship. As much as I hate to see her leave at least she'll get away from him. - There's two months of summer before she goes to Chicago. Anything could happen. - What could happen, Grandma? What could happen? - Ask your mother. - You talking about me and Jeff, aren't you? - You were with him Friday and Saturday nights, weren't you Tilda? - Yes. - Are you sleeping with him? - Yes. I love him, Mama. - Nevermind that. - Nevermind? What are you talking about? - I'm talking about what could happen. Would you like me to give you a list? - Getting pregnant's number one, isn't it? - Well it's up there. - Well you don't have to worry about that, I'm handling it. - But you're not handling the truth. - Jeff and I don't lie to each other. - You're lying to yourself! - I don't have to listen to this. - You think Jeff is gonna change your life for you, don't you? Gonna make everything new and romantic. He's doing something illegal so it's adventurous. Hon, I promise you, the only thing in it is pain. - Are you saying that's all there is with you and Dad? - Every time he got arrested how do you think I felt? I hurt so bad it made me hate him. - I don't believe you! You're just trying to scare me off of Jeff! - Yes I am. - If you hated him, why did you hang on so long? You could have divorced him! You could have married Andy or something! Why did you hang on? - I don't know. Because-- - Because you love him! - Yeah. - Then it's worth it, Mom. That's the reward, isn't it? - It's a punishment, Tilda. - Jeff is not what you think! He's different, he is! - He is not! Every time I look at that boy I feel like I'm looking right at your dad when he was that age. It's so easy to be seduced, so easy to believe him. - Mom! - Tilda you listen to me, you listen to me, Tilda! (tense music) (sobbing) Oh Tilda baby. (light music) - Okiedoke, thanks Jim. - Rachel said you might come. I'm glad you did. - Quite a place you got here. - So how are things? Fine? - Not complaining. Still excited just to be out. - Adjusting. It's not so easy I think. This is what I found when I come to this country. Every opportunity seems so large. But you have just the scratch to start from. - That's just it Andy, I don't even have the scratch. Guess I didn't realize how hard it would be to get a job. Any job. - You're a machinist, no? - Well I've studied it but I haven't had that much practical experience. - We look like a small operation here, but last year we were bought by Bergkamp Farms. We have our own machine shop out on the old Halstead Road. - I see, well that sounds good. - I'd like to help you. - But? - No buts. Just fill this out. I take it to the board then. - Board? - Oh nothing to worry. I am the foreman here, I carry some pretty big weight. Don't let this bother you. - Well just in case I don't get the job. Would you mind not mentioning this to Rachel? - I understand you. I keep this private. - Wait a minute. Says here they want a biography? (laughs) - Nothing to worry. Nobody's expecting Tolstoy. - If I was Tolstoy, I wouldn't mind. I mean, my past. Doing time's not a great conversation piece, it's not exactly what people wanna hear. Here, thanks anyway. - Oh I won't take it, it's yours. You will get the job, Matt. Just fill it out. - Yeah, alright. Thanks. I don't know about this. Thanks anyway. (pensive music) - Come on Tilda. It's real late, you better be getting home. - No, stop moving, I'm never gonna get this right. - Don't punish her. She's probably real worried about you. - I'll bet. - You shouldn't lie to her about that arts scholarship either. She deserves to know. - I didn't lie. - You're letting her think you haven't heard from the art institute yet and that's a lie. - Well that's what families do to one another, they lie. Glad you don't have one. - I'd give my eye teeth to have a family. Lies or no lies. Dad to tell me I was great even if I was the biggest knucklehead in class. Mom to call me a genius even if I couldn't tie my own shoelaces. - I'll call you genius. And I'll teach you how to tie your shoelaces. Like it? - What would you say if... - If what? - Well if we both went to Chicago? - You mean that? - Do you think if you won that art institute scholarship I was gonna let you go up there alone? I asked you a question. - I was afraid of losing you so I didn't wanna think about it. - I got some money saved up, get us out to Chicago. I'll get me a job, you get yourself one. Maybe go to the art institute at night until I make some more money. - Okay. - Go with me, Tilda. (soft music) Be my family. - I don't know. - You scared? Go home. - I swear the good lord didn't know how to create the fires of hell until he spent a July in Halstead. - Want some iced tea, Mama? - Yes, just pour it over my head. - Oh thanks. - Fence is falling down, tomatoes need staking. Attic needs cleaning. Nothing's gonna be done in this heat. I'm having trouble moving. I'm having trouble breathing. - Sure not having trouble complaining. - When I was a girl I woulda had cayenne pepper sprinkled on my tongue if I sassed my elders like that. - Coulda been a lot worse Grandma, I coulda just squirted you with the hose. - You wouldn't dare. (spraying) (screams) (laughing) - See Grandma, you're not having trouble moving now. - I'll move you, you little monster. - Pipe down Mama, look you're all cooled off. - Oh yes, come to think of it I do feel better now. - See? The good lord works in mysterious ways. (chuckles) - Wonder what the weather's like in Chicago. - Should be beautiful there in the fall. - I meant now. - Now? - Yeah, I'm thinking I might leave next week. Like right after the 4th. - Baby, you don't mean it. You won your scholarship? - No Mama, I lost. I'm not getting a scholarship. - How do you mean? - I mean I lost, they sent me a letter, I didn't make it. - Oh baby, I'm so sorry. - Yeah but it's okay you know because I got alternatives. - What kind of alternatives? - Where can you go with no money? - Jeff has some money. - Tilda, you're not going anywhere with Jeff. - I just said I'm thinking about it. - Matt, help me. Tilda! You are not going to Chicago with that boy. - Mom. (sighs) - Rachel, I think she's old enough to make that decision for herself. - She is not old enough! - I am, Mom, I'm 18! I'll be 19 in a couple months! - I'll have you stopped. - Rachel, for god's sake. Go to your room Tilda, go on. (light music) - Matt, I meant what I said. I'll have her stopped. - What do you wanna do, scare her to death? - Yes, if that's what it takes to get some sense into her. - She's scared enough as it is! You've gotta give her a little breathing room! Have a little faith in her! - It doesn't work like that, she'll make the wrong decision. - You mean like you did? You regret leaving home with me. (pensive music) Tilda says you might be going away together. - [Jeff] Yeah, we're talking about it. - I guess you know her mother's set against it. (gentle country music) - How 'bout you? - I don't know yet. Cheers. - Tilda either. She says she's scared. - Well. You can understand, I mean, her mother. - I don't understand if she loves me. Why's she so scared? - What do you mean if she loves you? - She says she loves me. I think she does. But she's loyal to Mama and we all know what Mama's afraid of, don't we? - What's that? - She thinks I'm like you, Mr. Kirby. I'm not like you at all. - How would you know? You don't know me any better than I know you. - I'm never going to jail. Like you. I'm not a loser. - Don't get too cute, hotshot. I punched the lights out on bigger chumps than you. - I'm not that fond of you myself. 'Cause you're the real thing that's standing between me and Tilda. When you were in jail man it was like you were a ghost. Your wife, she looks at me and sees you. - How do you know she just doesn't see you for the little jerk you really are? - Look, I don't care how you see me. I love your daughter, okay? I love her more than anybody's ever loved her. I plan on taking her away to a place where she can learn what she's dying to learn. Away from a town she's outgrown. - Yeah. I'd like to do the same thing for her but I just wish that I could afford it. - I've got the cash. Plan on making more money. Wanna be a success. And Tilda? She's gonna be a success too. She deserves it. I'm gonna make us both happy. I plan on being on top, being a winner. - Don't we all. - [Waitress] Thank you hon, bye. - Good luck to you. - Hey Kirby! Wait! - Get lost. - That was real lame of me, okay? - Forget it. - Don't run away. Let me get you a job. - Huh? Job? - Tilda mentioned you're having a rough time. - I'll live. - The guy who owns this place, Ernie? He likes me a lot. He'll do anything for me. Let me get you a job. - You mean in there? Huh. Got too many memories of that place. Besides, I'm on parole, I'm not even supposed to go into joints like that. - Inside is where you're safest. You'll get protected. That's what we're paying for, guaranteed protection. - I haven't done anything, I don't need any protection. - Think about it man. - Yeah yeah, I'll think about it. (trying to start engine) - What the hell's the matter with this thing? (engine starts) - Hey kid, excuse me. Wasn't that Matt Kirby? - Yeah. - What's going on? We were supposed to meet here and I'm a few minutes late and he rushes off. Doesn't give me much leeway, huh? - Maybe it slipped his mind. - You know where he lives by any chance? I've come a long way and I'm kinda tired. He's expecting me. - No. No idea. - Come on kid, you can tell me, he'll be glad! He's one of my oldest friends. We used to ride the trains together. - Okay pal. So you oughta know where he lives. - What's his name, Mitchie? - I think I'm gonna call him Firecracker. - That's a good name. - Rachel? - Yeah? - You don't look so pretty like you usually do. You look kinda tired. - I'll see you later, Mitchie. (dog barks) Bye Firecracker. Andy. Would you mind if I take the rest of the day off? - Take as long as you want. - Thanks, Andy. - I've been worried about you. I don't say it, but you don't seem like yourself lately. - It's just been kinda hard lately, that's all. - You know I'm here to talk, if you want. - Thanks, Andy. Andy, you know how hard I tried with my family. I've tried so hard but-- - But? But what? - Don't seem to be doing a very good job. Tilda's-- - Rachel. Will you listen to me? You are taking too much on your shoulders. They are not built for it. - With Matt gone I haven't had much choice. - And now that he's back? What is he doing for the family? - Everything he can. - I don't believe this. - He's been to every machine shop, every factory, every farm. - Then why didn't he return my application? - What application? - He asked me not to tell you. I don't like this, Rachel. I gave him an application. - And? - I never got it, Rachel. (train whistle blowing) (tense music) - I don't know what to say. - He must not want the job. Maybe he goes only where he knows he will fail. - I don't believe that. He's been trying so hard. - Then why not here, where he has such a chance? - I don't know! - It hurts me so deeply to see you like this, Rachel. You've waited years for this man. Supported yourself with hard work. Raised his family. You deserve so much better. You deserve that he should try as hard as you have tried. Maybe you are not in love with him. Maybe you are still in love with a memory? - He's all that's left, Andy. - Of what? Of what? - Of my hope! My hope! I don't know how else to say it. He's the love of my life Andy, he's a good man. - I pray this is true. - No no no. Need a little help here lady? - What you been up to today? - Oh, just giving those guys a hand before the sun goes down. - Uh huh. - Thanks. What's for supper? - Peanut butter. - Oh, great. What about Brussels sprouts? (laughs) - Dessert. Any luck today? - Hardly a nibble. Everybody closing up for the 4th weekend. Came close at the post office though. Then after my interview the guy didn't think it was worth me filling out an application. I think he thought I looked like a guy a dog might like to bite. - You already have an application from Andy. Why didn't you fill it out? (pensive music) - It was no use honey, no chance. - You don't know that. He wouldn't have given it to you if he'd thought that. - Nah, he was just being nice. Being nice to you, actually. - Oh you always have such a good excuse for everything. - Rachel, they asked for a biography. Look honey, you're just gonna have to trust me on this. I know I lied to you in the past but I was also lying to myself. This time it's different. - Is it? - Rachel, what do you want me to do? - Get another application from Andy. - No. - If you don't wanna fill it out I'll fill it out for you! - I don't need your or anybody else to fill out an application for me. Don't you think I have any pride, any respect? - Pride? It's your pride that's gonna put you right back where you came from! - What the hell are you talking about, woman? You think I wanna go back to jail, is that what you think? - I don't know. But if you do, you're never gonna see me again. I'm not gonna come visiting you every week bringing you cookies and cheerful little greetings from the outside. I won't damnit, I won't! - I don't want you to! Can't you see that I've changed! Why won't anybody let me be different? What are you looking at? (tense music) (soft piano music) Sarah. - Oh Matt. Sit down, you look terrible. - Mm. I feel better than I look. - No you don't. Don't put on any airs with me. You look terrible and you feel worse. - Where is she? - Already in bed. Said she had a headache. She could have been more original. What did you fight about? - I wouldn't know where to begin. - Tell you what, Matt. I think maybe it's just too hard for you at home here right now. You're suddenly supposed to be a husband, a father, provider. Those are all heavy burdens. I wouldn't blame you for collapsing under 'em. - What do you think? Think I should leave? - Well it's just so you'd be freed of everything. So that you'd only have to think of taking care of yourself for a while, you know, just til you get on your feet. - I appreciate it but I don't see it like that. - Well just think about it. It'd be better for all of us, and I'm thinking of you too Matt. It'd be better for you. - Well. I'll think about it. - I'm not trying to hurt you, Matt. Honest to god I'm not, it's just that we've been... We've had... Things have been so hard for us for so long that I don't know how much more pressure we can all take. - See you later. (train whistle blowing) (Scottish music) - Mr. Kirby. How are you? - Pretty good. Just doing a little thinking. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Tilda been around by any chance? I need to talk to her. - I haven't seen her since I last saw you. - Really? - [Jeff] Yeah she's probably practicing for tomorrow. - Practicing? - Well she won the twirling competition. Gets to lead the parade. - Huh. - Didn't she tell you? - No, no, I didn't know. I guess she forgot to tell me. - You decide whether you want me to talk to Ernie? - Ernie? - The guy who runs this joint. - Too many memories. Look, if you should see Tilda... Ah, nevermind. I'll be seeing you. - Come on fellas, if we don't get this we're gonna be here til Christmas. (shouting) - Hey, pal. What's the matter? You look like you seen a ghost. - Crow, I thought you were dead. Honest! I read that you were killed in some car wreck in Kansas City. I don't believe this. - It's good to see you, pal. I been thinking about you a whole lot lately. - Yeah, I been thinking some about you too. - As a matter of fact, I spent the last day sitting underneath the railroad trestle down by the river. Thinking how we used to ride the freights together. Ha ha, we had lots of good times, you and me. I really missed you. - I really didn't, I didn't know Crow. - How's Rachel? She must have missed you too, huh? And your daughter, what's her name? - I never woulda said anything, you know that. - What's your daughter's name? - Tilda. Tilda. - Yeah, Tilda. - Look. You've got me wrong, Crow. I was D and D and you know it. Deaf and dumb for seven years. I never killed anybody and I never talked to nobody. You were my best friend. But I never understood that deal, Crow. I mean, how... Why did you kill those people? I thought you were just gonna scare 'em a little. - Way I heard it pal is that you're out on parole because you turned state's evidence. - That's right, but I thought you were-- - Alright pal look. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Let's you and I go down to the river. - It's me, it's me! We can work everything out! - Move! - Yeah, sounds like a swell idea, Crow! (Scottish music) (cheering and laughing) - Will you girls please get over here? We need your help. - We'll be there in a minute. - Tilda, what's happened to my pizzas? (shouting) - I thought you wanted-- (tense music) - Matt? Tilda? Mama? (train whistle blowing) (suspenseful music) Who's that? - It's me. - God, you scared me. I didn't know you were home. What are you doing? - I'm leaving. - Really? - Uh huh. - Matt, listen, I didn't mean what I said, it's just-- - It's alright. - I was just tired. - Look I didn't realize how hard it was on everybody. (sighs) I thought when I got out of prison things would be better but instead it's gotten worse. Right now it's not even safe. - Safe, what do you mean? - Crow's not dead. He showed up tonight with a gun in his hand. If I stay here pretty soon somebody'll get hurt. - But that's not possible, we all saw the picture in the paper. - I know. - Well there must be, did you call the police? - Never had much luck with the police. - Oh god. - Rachel, I don't like to see you like this. If I leave you'll be better off. You won't have to worry whether I have a job or not or what my state of mind is. It's better this way. - Where will you go? - I don't know. Where nobody knows me and I don't have a past. - Matt, please don't go. I can't bear to lose you again. I finally got you back, just can't bear to lose you again. - You look so beautiful, Rachel. (crying) - Oh Matt. Please don't go, please don't go, please don't go. - God knows I love you so much. I'm sorry. - Oh! - Tell your parents yet? - I think I'm gonna tell them after the parade. - Okay. I don't know how long it is before we're gonna get them jobs. Or how long the $2,000 is gonna last. But we'll make it work. - You know there's not a whole lot of courage in my family. But you make me feel courageous. You do. You make everything seem possible. I couldn't do any of this without you. - Of course you could. - I couldn't. I don't think I could live without you. - I love you. - I love you too. (knocking) - You stay here. (knocking) Yeah, who is it? - [Matt] Hey it's Matt. Tilda here, Jeff? - [Tilda] Yes, I am. - Come in, Matt. - I thought I'd find you here. Just came by to say goodbye. - Are you leaving? - Yeah. That's it. - When? - Uh, don't know yet. - Does Mom know? - Yeah, she knows. - I'm leaving too. - Chicago? - Yeah. Both of us leaving right at the same time. (sighs) Maybe I should wait awhile. - I dunno, if you wait a while, sometimes it becomes a longer while and before you know it, moment's past. - What about Mom? - She knows sooner or later you're gonna go. And you. Just have to prove to her she was wrong about you. I know you will. - Thank you. - Tilda, I think your mother needs a friend about now. - Well then... Bye Dad. I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you too, honey. I'll be in touch. So what are you gonna do in Chicago, Jeff? - I don't know yet. I'll find work. - Yeah. Yeah yeah, sure you will. Just keep it on the up and up. - We'll see. - How about a promise? - Hey come on man. You know there's nothing more I'd like to do than go straight. You know. Never touch a marked card again. I can't promise that'll happen. - If you don't, it won't happen. - And if I do it's a lie. All I can promise to you is that I won't lie. Either to you or to Tilda. - Nobody's asking you to lie. I'm just telling you Jeff, no matter how bad it gets, anything's better than jail. - I'll buy that. What about you? Can you keep it straight? - Never going back to the joint. Can tell you that. - Wish you all the luck in the world. - Thanks. Well. Well I better hit it. - Hey man, if you really are leaving. What you... What you gonna be doing for cash? - Oh I still got some dough left from my severance pay. Freedom money it's called. (chuckles) - That's a good one. I got some money saved up. I'd sure like to give you a little piece of it. - Nah, thanks. Hang onto it, you'll need it for Chicago. - You sure? - I'm sure. Take care of Tilda, Jeff. I mean it, son. I mean it. - I hope we don't lose touch of you. I feel like we're almost friends. - Yeah, me too. Take care of yourself, be seeing you. (gun firing) (dramatic music) Jeff! Come here! Easy kid, easy. Just take it easy, take it easy. It's alright, I'm gonna call for help. - Where? - Huh? - The money. - It's alright. - Tilda, Tilda. - Alright. - Take the money. - Easy son, easy, easy. Oh my god. (sighs) (dogs baying) (train whistle blowing) Crow, come on out pal. I'm down here! Where are you Crow? Huh? (suspenseful music) Come on out! Come on, I'm here! You wanna kill another one? You wanna kill somebody else? Come on out! Come on! What's the matter, you chicken? Too scared? Takes some guts why don't you? Nothing but a fat piece of slime! Come on, come on! Where are you? Come on! It's your old pal! Crow? Where are you Crow? Where are you? Come on out, come on out Crow, I'm here! Come on out! (gun fires) (train whistle blowing) I'm free. I'm free. (sobbing) - [Tilda] God, it's so unfair! It's not fair Grandma! - I know, I know. - How could God be so cruel? I hate him! - I know, I know. Those are the same things I said to myself when I heard that your grandad had been killed in the war. I said to him. I know I could think of how unjust and how senseless. And I'd always thought of myself as a god-fearing woman but I despised him for that. You hear me, you hear what I said? - Yes. - But I still. 'Cause there I was with a little girl to raise all by myself and no way to support myself. - What did you do? - Well I wanted to bundle your mother up and go out and meet the world and find a new life but I didn't, I just stayed at home. I let my relatives take care of me. And I stayed bitter for years. To tell you the truth. I haven't told that to anybody. Don't you let that happen to you precious, don't. (gentle music) So much life ahead of you. Don't do it. There there, that's good, alright. Remember that. (light music) - [Andy] Matt? - Hey, Andy. - How's the arm? - Oh, it's okay. Didn't even know I was hit until the cops told me. - Hmm. I just stopped by the police barracks. There are no other prints on the gun. Only the ones of Crow. - Yeah I'm not surprised. I could never get his hand off the gun. - Yeah. How's Tilda? - Cries herself to sleep. Wakes up and cries some more. - Rachel alright? - She's okay. Go on in, she's inside. - Oh no, no, I just come to tell you about the gun. I thought you'd want to know. - Thank you, I appreciate it. - If there's anything that I can do for you... - I would like to ask you something. - [Andy] Yeah? - Remember that application you gave me? I tore it up. - [Andy] Did you? (chuckles) - Yeah. Know it's kinda late now Andy but you think you could get me another one? - Sure. - You think if I was to fill it out and tell the truth about myself, you think there's a chance I'd get a job? I mean, really? - A good chance. I give you my word. - Thank you. I'll come by to see you on Monday. - Good. I wait for you. - Thank you. (train whistle blowing) - Trains keep going as if nothing happened. As if there's some more of the world out there. I'll love him for the rest of my life. And I don't know what to do without him. I don't know what to do. - What Jeff wants you to do. (crying) - He'd say go to Chicago. And I'd say I've got $120 and he'd say but you've also got your courage. - [Matt] That's right. - No. He was my courage. - No, nobody can give you courage, honey. You gotta reach down inside and get it out of yourself. - I don't have it in myself, Dad. - Yes you do. You scared? - Yes. - Oh. Everybody gets scared sometimes. I been scared all my life. Scared of Crow and scared of failure. Even success. Ran away from things for a long time. Believe me. Doesn't work, Tilda. - Going to Chicago is running away. - No. Going to Chicago is running to. - You think for a minute I can go to Chicago on my own? - Why not? - Ever since I was little, I listened to the trains. I knew someday I'd be on one. (train whistle blowing) I even had one all picked out. It had a special sound. Now I really don't have any choice, do I? - No. - I have to go and see what's there. - That's it. You go and see! You check it out. - Oh Daddy. - Honey. Here. Jeff left this for you. - I don't want it. - He wanted you to have it. Guess it was his way of telling you what to do. - Why didn't you give it to me before? - I wanted you to make up your own mind and not have the money make it up for you. - [Tilda] I did make up my own mind, didn't I? - You sure did. I'm very proud of you, honey. So proud of you. ("America The Beautiful" instrumental) - God's teeth. - After this I'm gonna start in on the attic. - Rachel. - Don't say anything, Mama. There's nothing left to say. I haven't got a tear left in my body, nothing. Where you going all decked out like that? - I'm going to church. Rachel, I have a few things to clean up with the good lord. You're not the only one with an attic, you know. Wanna come with me? - No, you go on ahead. I guess this is my way of talking to him. Oh Mom. You think Tilda's ever gonna forgive me for the way I treated them both? - Well, I think the important thing is for you to forgive yourself. Now listen to me. You have been very strong-willed ever since you were no higher than this chair. You just taking on the world like it was up to you to change everything. Singlehandedly! But there are some times, and I think this is one of them, when you have to let go! And you have to let it be alright that some things are bigger than you are. And have courage. Put it in God's hands. (gentle music) I declare, the universe is just about perfect. Matt, you know me well enough to know that I like to be right. And when I'm wrong I don't like to admit it but I'm gonna say it outright. I have been wrong about you and I've just been determined to believe the worst. I hope you can forgive me. - Consider it done, Sarah. - Those tomatoes have worms on them the size of pencils. There's a can of dust in the garage I think or... No it's in the attic. Well, see you at the parade if you stick around. Son. (light music) - Wouldn't happen to run across a can of tomato dust up here, did you? - No, no tomato dust. But we sure have every other kind. (sighs) I guess it seems kinda crazy that we're trying to clean all this up just makes way for fresh dust. - Need some help clearing this place out? - Matt. I don't know what you're planning or what you're feeling now but I've been doing some thinking. - Yeah, me too. - I'm shaking, I feel just like a schoolgirl. I guess I stored up a lot of resentment while you were gone. Kept me from seeing who you are now. I was holding on to blaming you. And you've been trying so hard. - All those years I thought of nothing but coming back and making everything right. I guess I thought we could just start up where we left off but it didn't work out that way. - There's time now. Plenty of time. If you'll stay. - That's what I came up to tell you. I love you, Rachel. I've always been in love with you and I always will. I can't leave. (romantic music swelling) (marching band music) (crowd chattering) - Hi Sarah! - Sarah you look great! (Scottish music) - Hi Andy! (crowd cheering) - You look so beautiful, Tilda. - Grandma says you're the most beautiful woman in Kansas. I think you still are. - There's so many things I wish I could change Tilda, so many things. - I'm gonna be alright Mom. You raised me up real good and I'm gonna be just fine. - You know I don't think I ever bought one of these before. (chuckling) - All aboard. - I feel like I'm going with you. - You are, Mama. (train whistle blowing) (marching band music) (light music) (MultiCom Jingle)
