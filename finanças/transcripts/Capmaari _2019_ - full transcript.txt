What's that? Not the music, sports or food. But, Kamasutra book. Hey Venki, those who hesitate to speak frankly about intimacy... ...will hit sixer for no ball at nights. What's that you're talking about 'no ball and sixer'? It's cricket. Gloves, helmet, bat and ball. This is men sports. It's not right for you. What's that men and women sports? We can hit only if given chance. Only if given chance, even Virat kohli can prove himself. Else, a broiler chicken. You eat something. When is your wedding party? I've planned this weekend. We'll make it a grandeur. Look here, you didn't attend the marriage? Must attend this party for sure. Else, I'll get tensed. If you give me a special treat, I'll come. Specially?

Hey, be quiet. Hello, it's okay about love. What's that 'matter' you said? That's meant, only booze for you. Come to my issue. Darling, that's why I said don't get married. Support, 'live in relationship'. You can hug if you like or can break up. Do anyone buy a wine shop for just few pegs? Hey, don't listen to these hardcore single people. They'll take you to the road.

You turned off the cooker for second whistle. What did you say now? Nothing. I heard as whistle. Golden words are not repeated. I like you talking, frankly. I too like you asking, frankly. How many husbands are concerned about this? Because of not speaking frankly... ...many women are leaving their husband or killing them. So, are you going to kill me, now? No idea as of now. I've to think. You traitor! What do you think about life? If there is no intimacy, there is no life. Separate the intimacy from life, there is no life at all. It's waste of living.

We've come to buy a car by taking loan and repay by hard work. Whereas, you're speaking, inauspiciously. Congratulations, sir! I too have the same problem. Recently, I bought a new house.

You take rest in home, happily. Oh, are you trying to make me as a servant with this as a reason? No chance. I'll get a different job. But, I'll feel bored till then. Shall I take leave and be with you? You're saying it, simply? If they expel you from the company? Let's both together start a company. 'Mannar and company'. Be serious. Okay, you apply for other companies. Anyhow, you'll get a job for your experience. Let's go for a holiday, till then. We didn't go for honeymoon too. Okay, what's the plan? Shall we go to Shirdi saibaba temple? Oh, no! Let's go to Shimla. After a few days... -Yes, this isn't hot. -Hey, Varsha! Hi, how are you? Hard hit. You left without telling me. That's why. Sorry, Varsha. No reaction. I told sorry, isn't it? Speak to me. No reaction. Maintaining the same. Hereafter, wherever I go I'll inform you. Okay? Now I need to go to restroom. Shall I leave.

She told me not to reveal to surprise you. Instead of coming to our office, will she go to the opposite building? Why are you sweating as if you ran in Olympics? Why are you making me tensed? Enough. Shut your trap and do your job. Okay. You didn't reveal me that you're going to join here. Hi, baby! You could've told me earlier, you're going to join my office. Why? Are you feeling frustrated, I've come between your romance. Hey, no. I thought of celebrating your joining, a grandeur. I saw your celebration in the office. You're happy to see her. Am I like a ghost to you? I went to get my phone. Last night, she spoke bad about you, isn't it? -So, I gave her a piece of my mind. -Oh did you? -Don't act. -Why should I act? Get out, first. Ok.Shall I kiss and go? Get out! [screams] -Didn't you eat? -No. Why? I'm not hungry. So, I didn't bring. -What are you doing? -Eat this. -I don't want. -Eat this. Eat now. Okay, give me. I'll eat.

Okay, if you get hiccups why did she drink water? You must ask her that too. Okay, how did the hiccups stopped for you when she drank water? You have to answer this. How will I answer if you ask twisted questions? Tell me. [hiccups] Where is the water? I'll drink water and come. -Do I look like goof? -How can I myself say that? Get lost. Where is Jai? He is lying upstairs, as he got fever. Where is Varsha? I think, she told she is going to the hospital. Jai has got fever but Varsha went to the hospital. What a funny world! Sir, is it a love failure? You're boozing at sunset. -Be quiet. -I've seen everything. You got fever and she went to the hospital. She went to the hospital and you're boozing here. What's this? Is it eternal love? Why are you blabbing? She went to the hospital as her mother isn't well. How do you know? Are you both sharing the informations? She told in the office. Are you going to office to talk with her? Only you can connect like this? -I'm saying since you've connection. -Hey, get lost. You're crossing the limits. I too will be enraged. -If enraged? -I'll go away by walk. Are you knocking down my beer? I'll take your beer. Hey, why are you sitting here? Henceforth, this is my cabin. You go to your place. Why?

Hey, I need to talk to you alone. Come out. What's your problem now? You want to know whether I love Jai or not, isn't it? I thought of clearing this issue to you. What are you going to clear out? You hold his hand. You take him to your house and gave beer. Am I his wife or are you? Oh, do you've doubt on that too? Sis... I'll kill you, if you say like that. I called you as sister. -This is also nice. -Damn it. Sis, I thought of dealing this issue, smoothly. But, you awakened the animal that was sleeping inside. Next year, this day... Mark it in your calendar. You'll see the other version of Varsha. The countdown starts. Baby, why did you do so? When you slap a colleague in the office... ...everyone will mistake you. Are you feeling sorry that I'll be mistaken... ...or for slapping her? Oh, God! Why are you connecting everything, wrong? -You're wrong, that's why. -Hey, it's hot. I'm connecting. I'm not worthy. I saw your worthiness in the moving train. Always saying this. Move away. I didn't do anything, believe me. Without doing anything, is she challenging me? She says, she'll show the other version. Another version? How will it be? Do you've a desire of seeing that version too? Hey, I just asked. Open the door. You go and open the door. We both are in feud. Go and open the door. I'm eating food, You go. I'll eat. You go and open. It's a tough job. Hey, why are you here at this time? Varsha 2.0 Okay? -What are you blabbering? -I'm not blabbering, sis. I've come to my home. Hey! Where are you going? -Just come here. -Oh, is this your room? Take it. I'm asking you. Without any sense... -Oh, this is my room! -What do you think of yourself? Thank you, sis. Jai, come here. -What happened dear? -Look here. -Why did you call her now? -Did I call her? She came with her baggage at midnight. When asked, she says it's her house. Her house? Just ask her to get out of my house. What are you thinking? Are you creating ruckus in my home at midnight? Better take your things and get lost. Go... I'll go. Before leaving... ...shall I tell what happened after taking fourth beer? What? Just a minute. Jenny, she just came for fun. She is ready to leave now. But, it's late night. Will it be good to send her out, now? Oh, will it be good if she stays in our home in late night? Both aren't good. But, what to do? Shall we send her before getting the milk? Get lost. Jenny! Oh, no! What would've happened after taking the fourth beer? Shall I go and ask? What are you blabbering, alone? Shall I give company? No need of your company. But, a small... What? Are you caressing her? No... If you go out, I'll cut. Hi, Jenny! Would you like to have hot green tea? Get out. Why should I go? Take it and go out. Sis... I'll kill you, if you say that. What's there to talk with you? Call Jai, I'll talk to him. Hi, Varsha! Good morning. -Hi! -What? Are you both enacting a drama? What are you doing here, still? I thought you'll leave early in the morning. What are you doing here? Get up and go to your house. Cool...cool...I'll go. Before that, I'll tell what has happened. Sis... I'll tell what has happened. You give me justice. On that day, my bike was flattened. I was waiting to go home. He asked me whether he'll drop. Yes. I thought him as friend and agreed. Oh... After reaching the house, I asked him to come inside. Yes. I asked whether he want coffee or tea? -But, he asked for beer! -Yes! I gave my father's beer. After taking three beers, he asked me to kiss. Yes. Did I ask you to kiss? I didn't ask. Only she asked me. -Did she ask you? -No, who asked? I knew then, what he will ask and do, if he boozes. I must go to restroom. You tell me! I told him to go home as Jenny will be waiting. He said, she is not Jenny but evil. Did you say so? She is telling lie. I never said like that. -When did I say...you? -I was enraged. I dragged him out. But, he said he'd leave only after a fourth beer. Do you know what he did after taking fourth beer? What's this? No, the floor will be spoiled if I do in the house. That's why... You've broken my trust, Jai. No... She isn't puking for that reason. She ate something in her house. Don't tell lies. I too felt like puking. Believe me. Look sis...he made me to puke. She is lying. I'm not worth it, Jenny. I'm watching your worth, one after another. Ask him, sis... I was innocent but he has shown me... ...the whole world overnight. It was good. She is acting. -Who is acting, you or her? -She is acting. No, he is acting. -She is acting. -No, he is acting. Look at her eyes. She is acting. No, he is acting. Look at her eyes. Stop...stop...stop. Both of you leave. Sis, why did you bring me to the hospital? I must know today, whether you or him is the fraud? Come. You want to know whether she is conceived or not, right? -Yes, doctor. -Give the sample. Will know the result in half an hour. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Doctor, what will be the result? Why? Don't you know? That's why, the problem. How does she look like? Wait in the reception, I'll tell. Okay, doctor. -Hello! -Hi! Hey, get up. Get up. Just half an hour. If the result is negative, you must flee with your baggage. -Sis...if it's positive? -Will get married. Then, it's okay. If it's positive? Why are you tensed? Don't I know what I did? I tried to say, don't I know if anyone do? My tongue slipped. Don't scare me. Sis...the doctor has come. -Mrs.Jai! -Yes. Sis...she called me. -Congrats! You're pregnant. -Thank you. Doctor! Will you check it again, please! How many times do I check, it's the same result. -Good job. -Thank you, doctor. No... I think the doctor is telling lie. Jai! Please, leave me for sometime. Has Jenny come there? [phone rings] Hello! What? Hello! I'm advocate, 'Power' speaking... Raffiq scam isn't a issue at all. Yesterday, I spoke to Ramnath... I spoke till dawn. Ask Raffiq to come here. Let's finish the case. Always blabbing on the phone. Hang up the phone. Okay, let me come to your case. If you both need divorce, the point must be strong. Like filter coffee! Will you both tell me the points? Tell me... You tell. You came asking for divorce, you've to tell. He had an affair before marriage. -Sir, she too had an affair. -Good point. -With whom? -With him. -What about you? -With her. I think they thought me as a goof and came here. Then? He'll not let me to work in the office. At least, he'll call me hundred times and say "I love you". Sir, when I didn't call her for an hour... ...she tortured me for a week. For that, have you come to torture me? Then? He'll not eat breakfast kept on table. -I must feed him. -You traitor! It's you who told it'll be nice if I bite the finger when you feed. Sometimes, if there is no breakfast, he'll ask the finger. He broke the dining table which I brought, fondly. Did I break it? We broke it. Sir, she said, it'll be different If we romance on dining table.. ...and she took me from bed. Sir, there is heater in the bathroom. But, he'll torture me asking for hot water. You, traitor! You always say, caressing while taking shower will be nice. What's that? Sir, it's not doing everything. How to say? Not like full meals but like light meal. You mean, light meal? Am I running a restaurant? Talking about food. Irritating people. I asked him to wear the boxer and sleep... ...but he sleeps bare. Why? Sir, I'm habitual of it from my childhood. -What can I do? -Stop it. The reasons you said are highly strong. If you say any simple reason, I'll try. Sir, she'll tap on my head, often. You too pat on my back. -Hey, didn't you bite my ear? -Didn't you bite my lip? Didn't you pinch my cheeks? Didn't you pinch my hip? You bite me on my neck, isn't it? You hold my bum, right? What did I hold? -I got it. -Sir! I'm saying, I got the point. Okay, you can't stay away from him even for an hour, it seems. -Yes, sir. -You mean, yes? What about you? I can't be away even for half an hour. If I file this case in the court, I'll get divorced for my whole life. Sir, then we'll leave. Come, dear. Let's go. I'm leaving, sir. Get in. Get in. Hey, I told you to get in. Sorry, baby. Get lost. You're doing too much. I thought of committing suicide. What mistake I did? So, decided to get divorced and came to lawyer's office. You want, divorce? Then, why didn't you tell him about Varsha. You'd have told him, isn't it? I couldn't reveal after seeing you. Look, if you keep your face like a innocent, how can I tell? I feel ashamed to say, the other woman has entered our life. I didn't do anything. Baby, I don't remember what happened in her house. Then, how come the test result is positive? Oh, no! I didn't plan anything and do. On that day, it happened in the train, isn't it? The same way, it would've happened accidentally in Varsha's house too. So, are we both the same? Please, shall we leave this topic? Give me few days time. Somehow, I'll clear it. Don't know... I can't let you go whatever wrong you do. That's is my dear baby! Shall we go? What Jai! I thought you'll let her go but you brought her to home. Varsha, please! Sis... You said If the result is positive... ...you'll get me married. Would the marriage be in temple or in hall? Just go to hell. Sorry, Varsha. We both were living happily. Because of me, everyone has got the problem. You know, isn't it? All these happened, inebriated. If this child is born, it's neither for you nor for me... ... but it was born for booze. So? -You go to the doctor and... -Go and... Go and please... Oh, are you saying to abort? Generally, I'll not say like that to anyone. My situation is like that. Please, Varsha. Okay, I'll leave. Straight to the police station. Hey, why are you going to the police station? Then, where should I go? Hey! Tell me. Police station? Why? Just a minute. -Police station? Why? -To file a complaint. You'll give a baby and you ask to abort it. Do you know how big crime it is! Do you know what the punishment is? -Jai! -I'm coming. -What's the punishment? -Wait, I'll ask and tell. -What's the punishment? -Life sentence. They'll juggle you between Vellore and Puzhal and torture you. Hey! She is speaking something. I can't understand anything. Okay, ask her what's her final saying. I'll stay in this house. Okay, stay in a corner of this house. What? Should I stay in a corner? You're just a wife. I'm the mother of his child. Legally, I've more rights than you. You've more rights, so what? -Let's share him. -Share me? -Am I a 'share auto' to share among you? -Sharing means? Three days in your room and three days in my room. Oh, crap! awful to hear itself. -This is difficult. -Why? If three days here and three days there, Where should I go for another one day? So, this is your problem? Hey, leave me. Seriously, I'll kill you. Can't you be idle for one day, in a week? You need three days with me and three days with her? Do you need two people? Hey, stop. Open the door. I'll also come. Hey, come by bike. Why should I come by bike? I've a share in the car too. -Sis...go to the back seat. -Why should I sit at back? I've conceived isn't it? If I sit at the back, it'll jerk. It's not good for the baby, sis... What's this Jai? What she said is right. It'll jerk if she sits at the back. She is pregnant. You go and sit behind, go on. Go... What? Thank you, Jai. Look, all these nasty things should be inside the home. We're someone in the office and you are someone. Understand? Understood. Jai, I'm telling you seriously... ...if this matter is revealed, I'll not be alive. I agreed to work in this company just because of the attached bar. But, not letting me to enjoy even for five minutes. Asking for pendrive and pencil. -Darling, pendrive. -What pendrive? Darling, I gave you a pendrive, isn't it? When did you give me the pendrive? I gave you, last evening. Last evening, we didn't meet. I gave you a red colour pendrive in the bar. In bar? Then, it must be with me. Don't know where I inserted it? Look Jenny, Jai always does this. He'll insert somewhere and deny it. Hey, just shut up. -Did you really give me? -You... If I call, you're not responding. That much busy I'm. -What are you doing? -We spoke yesterday, right? That shouldn't be simply in words. So, I indulged in action. Dude, today's turn is this room. Are you playing? -No chance. -Why? Baby, the air-conditioner is not working in that room. How could I sleep? Hey, you... Thank you sis. Good night. Dude, not feeling sleepy? I'll sleep if I have a beer. Jenny isn't giving. Now, you want a beer, right? -Will I get? -Just wait. How is it? Hey! Thank you. Why are you so fast? Starving for two days. So, it's over. One more? -Will I get? -Yes, you'll get. Wonder, you do magic! I'll do anything for your sake. It's cool! It's over. It didn't come. It'll not come to everyone. Oh, will it not come? Do you want one more? No, enough. Why? If I take more than two beers, I might do something. -What will you do? -No... I'll hug. Then? I'll kiss. Then? I'll lay down. Sis...are you panicking? It seems, you've expected something. Sorry, I opened the door thinking as it's kitchen. There is no door for the kitchen. I know... Then? You're saying about your love. Go ahead. That's a short story in a long train. It won't be good to hear, but, nice to watch. Hey, when did you come? I came at 12 o'clock. She slept. Good boy. Don't you attend the call? Are you watching 'tiktok'? How many times to call you? What do you want? It's you, who called me. Okay, hang up the phone. -Ask Jenny to come. -She has taken leave today. Ask Jai to come. Since she took leave, he too is on leave. Oh! no. What about Varsha? She resigned and went to America, didn't she? -JD, have you forgotten everything? -I didn't forget. You all together, perplexed me and made as a goof. -Why are you standing here? -I've sent a mail. -Project? -No, my leave application. Everyone take leave and go. I'll sit here all alone, like a mad and press the bell. Do you want a bell? I'll manage with the existing bell. -You can go. -Okay. It's me. Bring the bell. Bring the file. Don't argue. Hey, damn it. It seems, I've to get along another girl to open the door. -Who are you? -Census officer. Are you Mr.Jai. Yes, come in. Sir, are you the house owner? How do I look like? You look like the house owner. Sir, tell me your name. -Vijay. I've told you already. My name is Jai. Tell your wife's name. Varsha. Thank you. Jenny. Sir, is she your sister? Yes, my sister. Hey! Actually, she is her sister and I'm her husband. Oh, is not so. Sir, who is she then? Sir, my name is Jai. She is my wife. They both are like sisters. I'm her husband. Okay? I can't understand, sir. Tell me, one more time. Who is your wife? Only three people are here. Can't you understand? I'll tell you from the beginning. Note well. Tell me, sir. I'm Jai. She is my wife. As both of them are sisters, I've become their husband. Sir, I'm getting perplexed. Tell me, slowly. I'm telling you for last time. I'll not repeat it. Note well. I'm Jai. As they both are sisters, I'm their husband. Sir! Is this slow? Tell me, fast. Sir! I'm an officer. Tell me, who is your wife among the two? They both aren't my wives. I'm not Jai. I don't want the vote. Better you leave, I'll take care. Hey, you put this ring in the church, right? Yes. Then, you say I'm not your wife. No, you're my wife. If she is the wife, then who am I? You're wife too. -Then, me? -You're my wife. Then, me? Hey, you both aren't my wives. You get out. It's too cold. Why are you taking my shirt? What is your's and mine? Do you know which place is this? Which place? Do you know which place is this? I'll know, if you tell. "The place where equality is prevalent". This song has to be sung at graveyard, not here. The deceased goes there, the drunkard comes here. Why are you talking like an educated person? I'm an educated only, grandpa. -Grandpa! -Okay, don't feel. Come on.

But not doing any chores. Simply sitting in the room. Go and do the chores. Are you telling me to do the chores? The child will scold you. Hi, daddy! Sorry, baby. What? Whatever we speak now, the baby in her womb will listen. If you ask her to do chores, won't the child scold you in future? Whatever I say will be always right. Why didn't you wash the utensils yet? Hey! Don't you've sense? Can't you sit carefully? -Oh, affection for her! -No, she is a stranger to me. This is for the sake of the child. Am I someone? I'm the mother of his child.

Jenny, you're in Varsha's post. Don't know where Varsha is... Why are you asking about Varsha to me? Is she in our home? He didn't ask about the house. Why is he saying as house! Look here, now you didn't ask about the house. If you ask again, I'll thrash you. -When did I speak about... -I said, don't talk. When she says not to talk, don't talk. Mad fellow. -Lunatic. -Fool. -Stupid. -Idiot. Senseless. I've never seen a worst person like you in this world before. That's it... What did I ask now, why are they yelling me? What happened? It's wrong, somewhere. Just a minute. What's this? You'll be asking token for toll, isn't it? Today is toll free. What's special today? She is immensely saying about her baby. And you're also caressing her a lot. Can she only have a baby? I too decided. Twins! In today's match, she should lose. Play properly. [humming] [doorbell rings] Open the door. You go and open the door. You go and open the door. Go... You go... You go and open... Go... You're lying on the top. Go... Will you lie on top and later open the door? Hey, you... Hi! -Hi! -Hi Jenny, how're you? I'm good. This is my latest girlfriend, Sanghi. Hi! [speaks gibberish] -Imported from Sangistan. -Welcome, come in. Where is Jai? Got up? Darling, I'm here, can't you see? You'll be getting up late from bed, usually. -That's why, I asked. -Oh... -Then? -Be seated. -Be seated. -Okay. Who is this? You bring the coffee. Look at the door, there is a board... [speaks gibberish] What's happening here? Nothing. Just jovially... Venki has come along with Sanghi. We both have come here to give the invitation. But you both stranded like a thunder. Keep there and go. Since you're the perfect couple, I came to give the first invitation to you. [speaks gibberish] But, you are disrespecting me. Come and get the invitation. All the best. Bye. [speaks gibberish] What happened, now? I got the invitation from you. The function is at 5 o'clock, right? We'll be there on time. You look after other works. Go... Are you insulting a friend? Yeah, let it be. You go distribute the invitations. Go on. Why are you dancing and saying it? It's the month which marks dancing. That's why. Will you nail on the other month? I'm cracking blunt jokes and you're worse than me. Go and distribute the invitations to all. Go... What? What are you... Hi Venki! Why are you? When are you back from America? Hi Venki! Full meals. Are you the chef? This is what you had screamed about yesterday. We're, 'live in together'. You people are, 'together living'. What an awes... Threesome. Hey, it's a filthy word. Oh! The word is filthy. But, what you do is... [speaks gibberish] What did she ask and what did you say? She asked who are they both? I told her decently, both are your wives. Decent! [speaks gibberish] [speaks gibberish] Actually... She yelled me badly. How do you know that language? Why do we need to know the language for yelling? I can see her, yelling. Please, take her out. [speaks gibberish] Come on. [speaks gibberish] It's okay, don't bother about her... Sis...you said, our story must be among ourselves. Now Venki is aware. How will you go to the office? Sis... hereafter, are we three going to be in the same bed? Thank you for your decision. Since, I pity for your child, you're crossing the limits. -You... -Hey! What are you doing? I was true to you, post marriage. But, you... You cheated on me. Fraud. Cheat. Come here. Why are you doing like this? You've adjusted many things. Why are you getting tensed for this small thing? Is this a small thing? Which is a small thing? Jenny, don't do anything, hastily. After the child is born and asks his father... ...can I tell, you've killed him? Why are you acting high? Hey, why are you behaving like a psycho? I just can't take it, anymore. Ask her to get out of my house. Where do you tell her to go in this situation? Is she more important than me? You both are important to me. What now? I said by mistake. No, you didn't say by mistake. You said what's in your mind. I can understand now. You've planned and brought her home. I'm a fool, believed your drama all these days. Jenny, why are you imagining yourself and cooking up the story? I'm not going to say anything. This is our last night, together. When returning from the function, if she is here, I'll not stay. Now you decide, whether you want me or her? I should've divorced you long before... That'll happen, tomorrow. -Hey, Jenny! -Wait. Jenny! "He got caught... He was caught red-handed" "He got caught... He was caught red-handed" "He was trapped by a lass He was shattered" "He just blew up the conch and knock it" "He tried to hit two mangoes, at once" "The stone slipped, missed the sign, missed the way, missed the path" "If he exceeds the count of four beers" "What's that he will be, how will he be" "Fraudster" "Fraudster, he hits hot" "Fraudster flirts too" "If the fraudster gets caught" "Fraudster" "Rowdy he's a proper fraudster" "I tapped the coconut shell My dear Kamatchi..." "Meenakshi has seduced me mildly My life has been lost" "By taking chance when I can Oh, no! Why this much problems?" "Make it one Take it one" "Simple one One by two" "Don't want, dude" "Hitting never goes flop.He made the idiot wear a vest and run around" "You're the deer and honey" "You gave me the Jasmine and trapped me " Whatever, I will not come out of this house. "Oh no! If he boozes and feels elated, he'll fall down" "Oh, no! He was knocked by two babes" "Oh, no! He chased away few and many " "Oh, no! He is a fraudster, knock on his head" "With no effects, he is the clown who eats the Palmyra fruit " "He became an intelligent fool" "You cheat, you troublesome lazy fellow, thief and fraudster" This is your ticket and passport. "Planning so many and tried many tit bits" Happy journey, ma'am. "Thief and fraudster" "Fraudster, he's going to get beaten up" "Fraudster, fraudster, fraudster" "Everyone must hit him up" "Even if he pleads," "must be pounded on" "Must cut him open in the middle of the road" "The police must shoot him." Why are you drinking heavily? JD, you know that myself and Jenny got married. That's known to everyone. There is another secret too. Tell me. Varsha, from our office... "My soul is leaning on you" "My soul, loves you like I do" "The first time I checked, pinching myself" "I pronounced your name" "My heart was sweating" "Will you tell am I right or wrong?" "I've never seen such a pleasure" "so far" "The heart which conveys gratefulness everyday" "Caressing each other with each breath" "no need to plead each other" Now you decide. What are you saying? JD, what will you do, if you're in my stance? I'd have told wife is important. Okay, what are you going to do? -Shall I get one more beer? -Hey, you can booze. But, not to the extent of searching your inner wears... ...in the morning. Then, have to search for life, like you. JD, I'll leave. -Very beautiful advice. -You keep it. Cooling is going down. Have it. Oh, no! Where are you going? Don't be afraid. I'm not going to commit suicide. I'm going to U.S. -Don't play. -Hey! The deadline, I said is over. She is inside. Then, I should leave, right? Okay, you be with her, happily. Don't worry about me. I'll take care of myself. Jenny, I can't live without you. Then, ask her to get out. Enough of sitting inside. Come out. Come. Please, get out. Suddenly, if you ask me to go out, where will I go, Jai? Go, wherever. How can you have a heart to say this? Did you forget everything? I didn't forget. I didn't forget anything. I came to your house. You gave me beer. You dragged my shirt. If you drag a guy, what will he do? I'm also a male. Did I rape you? If it has happened with a married guy, what will a good woman do? Instead, you came to my house and disturbing our life. Which wife will allow another woman to stay in the house? She allowed you with kind heart, will you behave arrogant, day by day? Look here, Jenny is important for me. Only she must be in this house. You shouldn't. Get out. Go... -I'll not go. -Get out. -Jai, don't be so rude. -Be quiet, Jenny. What will she do to at the most? Will she go to the police station or call me to court? I'm ready to face anything. Hey, you shouldn't stay even for a second in this house. Go out. Come. Hey, come. No, Jai. Please, Jai. Go... Open the door. Jai! Jai, you behaved harshly, to Varsha. Hey, goof. I'm telling you, seriously. She looks pityful. You too feel bad for her. Nothing like that. Can I ask you something? You must reply frankly. Before our marriage, if she had proposed you... ...you'd have married her, isn't it? Maybe... But, after you came into my life, no other girl is in my mind. Love you to that extent, baby. Hey, get up. Come. What? Good morning, bro. Dad is here, whom are you wishing? First, we must know to respect ourselves. Else, no one will respect. Understand? Who is the fool to teach these things? It's you.. Go...sleep, go. Jenny! -Jenny! -What's this Jai? You go to Bombay for meeting, two days a week. Aren't there any other people in the office? What to do? JD believes only me. It's a big project. It can be done, only by me. I'll go and come back, soon. Okay? -Bye. -Wait...wait... This spectacles are nice on you. You tell as if you're seeing just now. Come back, soon. -Okay. -Bye. Bye. Thank you. -Hi daddy. -Hi. How are you? Come on. Sit down. Always, you'll kiss me as soon as I arrive. You didn't even speak, today? What happened? Then, you come for two days in a week. And also two hours late, today. Late by two hours? For the work I do, you've to adjust... ...even if I'm late by twenty hours. Should I adjust ever? No, I didn't mean that. Adjust to some extent. If you're dubious, tell me. I'll divorce Jenny, immediately. Shall I go and do, immediately? I'll divorce her this moment. You think, I'm just saying? If you be silent, I'll divorce her. I'm going. I've started. I was listening all your dialogues. All these years, you lived cheating me, isn't it? Fraud, I'm ready for the divorce. Decide when it is and tell me. Rascal. Just five minutes. I'll be back. Where are you going? Always you give her the first preference. Am I a servant? Should I compromise everytime? Hey, why are you talking like this? I gave up boozing for five years, just for your sake. I don't know all those. Henceforth, if you want to come to this house... ...as you said, divorce her and come. Oh, no! Can I get a beer?
