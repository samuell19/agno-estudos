Hey girl, easy does it! I'm older than you are! Don't run so fast! Hey stranger, why don't you buy me a drink? Hey Bill, will you pay or what? Give me a drink and a bed. The drink will be here. The bed is upstairs. Here?s the money. My horse is by the hotel door; ensure he is taken care of. Today is Saturday. It's fitness day. Look, from last week's bottle. Luckily, the doctor was here. He cured me. Yeah, doctor.... Just a bullet collector, all extracted from those anatomies. He already has a full big box. I also fix people's broken bones and make a delicious laxative for children. I'm a genius in this rat hole, where there is only one beautiful thing. Look at her. But just for a short time! - Can I buy you a drink, princess? - No, thank you. Leave all those lowlifes and come to my table, Mary. - I got paid many dollars today. - C'mon, grandpa, don't be silly. Me, silly? You are the only envious one, you bearded beast! Enough! You're a bunch of savages! I told you no more quarrels! So pay for the damages and go to bed! - I just had one drink. - Then take the whole bottle with you. - Move! - That's better. Today is Saturday, and the man who kicks me out of here hasn't been born yet! You deserve this. Take care of him! You should be good boys and obey mommy, like the others did. - C'mon, boss! - Did you forget your baby bottle, Pete? Very funny. But you better stay out of this, Coulbert! Working a whole week like animals to throw your money here on Saturday is foolish! - What? - I said 'foolish'! - I heard you. - There he is, Pete Davy. The Spiritual Father of Julia Brooks and her miners. - When will you preach to me, Pete? - I don't want any fighting, OK? Of course, he's in a hurry. I think that if he is late home his wife will spank him! I don't like bullies like you! C'mon, let's go! You know I won't give you a chance to draw your gun. All of you saw how he spat in my face! He would then shoot treacherously, like he always did. - But this time I was smarter. - Yes, way too smart. What are you trying to say? Well, it's Nevada Joe! What did you find wrong this time? Coulbert's newest victim. As you all saw, this man didn't have the chance of defending himself. You will regret this if you don't leave immediately! I was going to leave tomorrow, but now I have something to do. You don't scare anyone here, so you better mind your own business. One of my businesses was to find out if you could shoot someone in the back. Now I know. Do you know why Coulbert is so nervous? Because he is a coward. Hands off your guns! Good. I would have done the same. And you wouldn't have any fun. He was a gun for hire. - That's it. - I knew him very well. In any case this whole thing nauseates me. Bartender, one whisky. You can leave now, "sweetie". But go back to Mexico! It's real Scotch. Only the best to formalize a deal. I bet you haven't had anything like this for ages. Are you always so kind with your customers? I like to pick my friends. Why such privilege? I've been here for a few days and so far I haven't found any gold. Did you look for it? No. That's the answer. You are not a foolish miner. - Of course not. - So, who is Nevada Joe then? Is the questioning part of the invitation? - Curiosity, I just want to know. - Very well then. In the Office of Vital Records in a small village in Nevada you can find a record with the name Joe Dexter he weighed 11 lbs. at birth. The baby grew, so he now weighs 85 kilos and he is known as Nevada Joe. I didn't want my father's name involved in my adventures. - Are you satisfied? - I like children's stories. Nevada Joe, I am offering you a job. Doing what? Golden Hill is a lawless town. We don't have a Judge or a Sheriff. The miners live according to a very primitive code. And I am just a woman. Who knows how to swim in this ocean. But my girls are crazy. Sometimes they overstep the boundaries and it becomes difficult to contain so many drunks. So you want to hire me as a thug. No, not at all. You will be my manager. Yeah. Someone specialized in kicking out the drunks and the penniless. Isn't that it? You will be paid handsomely. $500 per month plus a share in the profits. What do you say, Joe? - I don't like to be a woman's salve. - Why don't you think about it? Very well, I'll try. Why don't you think about it here? My room is number 20, darling. Through that door, isn't it? The night got spoiled, Mary Blue You know? It's a shame you are a business woman. Good night. Joe! - Good night, Doctor. - OK, that's another thing. - Good morning, sir. - Here. Say bye to Mary Blue on my behalf. - Don't you like Golden Hill, sir. - Too quiet for my liking. Quiet?? ....Thank you. Let me warn you. You have visitors. The Mulligan brothers. Gunfighters are never alone around here. Here. Get my horse ready while I take care of those gentlemen. Too bad for you, Nevada Joe. You should have left after you did it. Did what? - After you killed Coulbert. - Was he your friend? We saw him once, didn't we? And you came to avenge him. Just to earn the $200 that someone has paid us to kill you. - Who is sending you? - That's a secret. - Guys, I have $500. They are yours if... - Thank you for the information! We would have found it in your corpse anyway. But if you have more money and you tell us where it is, that would pay for the killing of the one who hired us. - Don't you think so? - Sure, but he won't see that happening. But he can be sure we will do it. That speaks of our honesty. That's very kind of you. However, I like to do these things by myself. And faster! Very well But I don't know how I missed. It never did before. But you hit in the middle of Mary Blue's heart. From now on, I know I can find you wherever is trouble. That's why I am leaving. Your house would have so many bullet holes that one day it would fall on us. We can discuss this in the dining room. If you leave now you will starve to death. And I have the reputation of feeding well my customers. Uncle, why don't you check those men? Maybe they are still alive. Alive? With a bullet through the head and another one through the throat? That Joe is quite something! Answer me even if with gestures. You will stay, right? You are stubborn. But ... this is what you like. With the added advantage that, in addition of fighting, you will get paid. Listen, Nevada Joe. I don't know what I would do to you. What are you after? Do you intent to travel the West until you find a fairy princess? That is the question. I have been looking for years for a place where to settle, but to no avail. I am offering you that chance. There is a woman, isn't it? Don' even think about that. I just get bored everywhere. I was an officer in the Confederate Army. Unable to learn anything useful, I became an adventurer. I've got a lot of history in my back. I'm useless because I have no skills. - Did you get that? - No. You are strong, and the fastest on the draw. I need a man who can defend me. I'm tired of fighting, Blue. Now I want to face life without a gun. I'm a silly woman, living in my dream world. I need to understand soonest that I am not your fairy princess. - It's not that, Blue. - Don't bother. Goodbye, Nevada Joe. Bye, doctor. Call me for the wedding. What wedding? Oh, thank you! - Hey, give me one. - Stop it! Or you will end like those, with pretty flowers by your grave. Taylor, open your eyes! Mr. Greer? He must be in the hotel. Maybe ... or he came to these guys' funeral. - Or to dance can-can. - So early in the morning? Palmer! Come here. Yes, Mr. Greer. - I have a job for you. Anything you wish. Nevada Joe! Dismount from the horse! Don't move those hands! Drop that thing! - Coulbert's friends? - No! - Then...? - Give me that! On your horse! Let's go! I don't take orders from anyone. You think you can afford to argue? If you don't come by grade we will have to tie you up. Who is sending you? You will know soon enough. Let's go. Sure you won't try to escape? Why? That's my right, isn't it? Let's go! Hurry up! Where is your gun? Your goons took it. The engineer ordered us to bring him here no matter how. One has to be careful with him. Those weren't my orders. Besides, I asked not to humiliate him. - Where is Mr. Greer? - In town. He is attending the funeral for two of John Randolph's gunfighters. Our friend killed them. Taylor! Give him his gun! See you soon, friends! My name is Brooks. Julia Brooks. You must know who I am, since you brought me here. Coffee? I'd prefer to know why I am here. You are quite pretty, but it's not necessary to bring people here by force to tell you that. - Sit down, please. - No. - You are like I expected. - Do you also wan to see my teeth? You killed yesterday the murderer of my former watchmen's foreman. - Did you make me come here to thank me? - No. I could be interested in a man with your skill with guns. I'm not looking for work. I'm not offering you an ordinary job, but rather a position of trust. It was my pleasure meeting you, Miss Brooks. I have no interest in either you or your offers. Don't go! Wait .... I haven't finished yet. Haven't you? I once knew a girl who spoke like you, and I left town not to see her again! Can't I deal with you in a friendly way? Yes ... I am a very loving man. - They always said that at home! - Let go of me! But if my rights are not respected I become like you: a wild cat! Your men forced me to come here, and I didn't like it! Have a good day, Mrs. Brooks. How could you do that? You're with a girl... and you only ate like an ox! Good for her on leaving! What about your girlfriend? You buying her drinks, and she was interested in that other guy. - Had she done that to me... - Shut up! Look at your pot belly! Leave me alone! Don't move. I never liked what you did. - Come here. - Smart ass. Is yours a fake? Watch me now! Come on ... Keep moving ..... Come on ..... come on. Here! Palmer! Palmer! Palmer ..... Have fun, little boy.... Palmer! What's going on? Take these off me! I can't move! - Watch it, he is around! - Who is around? - Hands up or I'll shoot you! - Don't be stupid, it's a trick! - I'm not stupid, I feel a gun on my ribs. - A gun? My arse! Bastard! Watch me now .... Aw! See you another day! Whoa! Whoa! Blacksmith! Hey, look who is here. We could avenge Coulbert, couldn't we? - Is it ready? - Yes. - I'll be back in a moment. - OK. Not so fast, pal. We have something to settle. - Bye, Mrs. Porter. - Bye. - Damn cheater! - He shot him in the back! You saw what happened in the saloon. Have you already forgotten? Your attitude may be unhealthy for you. Unhealthy .....? Both of you, stand back! Everybody calm down. You idiot .... you like too much playing with your gun. - Of course you are going overboard, pal. - Keep going the way you started. Tell your men to leave me alone. Why don't you leave Golden Hill now while you still can? I don?t want to travel now, it makes me feel tired. Understand? In this case I must warn you that you could find here eternal rest. Which are your favourite flowers, Nevada Joe? Are you the boss around her, Mr. Boastful? I own the transportation company. My name is John Randolph. - Doesn't that make me a boss? - I see. And that's why you ordered Coulbert to kill Pete Bailey. That's a lie. And who do you think you are to question me? Are you now Golden Hill's self-proclaimed Judge? I wasn't questioning: I was accusing you. I'm also accusing you of ordering them to kill me. It's ridiculous to accuse me with no proof. Don't worry, I will provide proof. Nice meeting you, Mr. Randolph. I know we will see each other again. - Hey! - Are you crazy, Joe? Why did you provoke John Randolph? Do you want to be shot? I haven't provoked anyone. Why should anyone kill me? You saw it. I'm the only peaceful man around here. Who is dangerously hugging a woman. You see that, you stubborn? I bring you good luck. - Luck? - Even if you don't want it. - I never had a doubt. - But you left. Just to return. I don't know why, but I'm sure it's not for me. Am I wrong? - I had some difficulties. - Even more? Two encounters just this morning: the gunmen and John Randolph. - You forgot two more encounters. - Which ones? You .... a sweet tumble. Thank you..... And the other one? Tell me about the other one. Tell me, Mary. Who is Julia Brooks? Oh, you like her. She is too temperamental. Yes, but she has both money and a respectable last name. - She must also have enemies. - Lots. Her father was the first gold prospector in this area. He abused his power. And now she has ruined everything with her silly pride. - Who are her enemies? - Would you mind coming in? You must be careful. You have confronted the worst people in Golden Hill. You haven't answered my question. Who are Julia Brooks' enemies? Everybody. Some out of envy, and others because she humiliated them. - Is Randolph also a victim of all that? - Maybe. To what extent? He's got a Government lease to carry passengers and cargo. He ships all the gold from this area, except the one from the Brooks' mines. Apparently, she never accepted John Randolph's expensive prices. I agree with her. She does not want to be exploited. - Do you like her? - What did you say? You are the one who has something to say. Do you like Julia Brooks? Just to argue with her. How's it going, Sammy? As you can see, I'm studying to become a witch. Bandits have assaulted our shipment! They stole the gold and they've killed four men! - Uncle! Uncle! - What's going on? Who is screaming? Look, they are bringing Julia. She is wounded! Damn! Get your stuff ready, doctor. You may have to extract a bullet from her. - Get out! This is not a show! - Didn't you hear the doctor? Get out immediately. Wait outside, please. Is it serious? Serious? What did you come for? Perhaps to congratulate you. Another bullet for your collection. Move away! I used to like you, but after what happened.... Had you helped Miss Brooks this would not have happened! Or perhaps the other guys paid you better? - If you weren't a doc I would punch you! - Let go of me! I want to talk with her. Sure! You give orders and the rest of us obey! What a .... - Put your head down. - It hurts, doc. Don't pay too much attention to my uncle. Julia is like a daughter to him. He loves her too much. Come in. That's nice, girl! You are now siding with that scoundrel! Uncle! Here he is. Cheer up, man. Julia won't die. Aren't you happy seeing me in this condition? Women are meant to stay home, taking care of the children. They're not meant to fight. If that's all what you had to say, you can leave now. I'm sorry about what happened. Who lead the robbery? Did you recognize any of the thieves? No. Why didn't you ask the Sheriff to protect you? I did several times. He says he cannot be everywhere. Especially in case of a prospective robbery. Your buggy is outside, Julia. But I still think you should spend the night here with us. Thank you, but I must go. - Tell Taylor to come and help! - Why? Nevada Joe is here. Come on, make an effort! - I'll make them marry each other, uncle. - Are you crazy? He's only good for shooting. Thank you. I'll like to continue yesterday's conversation, Miss Brooks. Why waste more time? That's it. - Palmer! - Yes? You drive. Taylor will bring back the horses. Very well, Miss. Let go of me! Thank you. You are welcome. You two have great manners! Let's go now. $57, Jim. According to my notes, you owe $80. Where is the rest? I'll pay you next week, Blue. You've been telling the same lie for the last 6 weeks. I'm just asking for my money. You'll have, you damn vulture! I sure hope so. And save your bad manners for another occasion. Here, I'll lend you $10 so that you can have a few drinks tonight. Damned women! If you didn't like women so much you would have more money! - Go to hell! - You too! Let me. Hi. - You're an experienced lender. - I've got some practice. And many customers. Why don't they go to the bank? They prefer to deal with me. - So they can look at your green eyes. - No. - I don't ask any questions. - Sure. -Are most of them from the Brooks mine? You are too nosy. Why do you care? You just said you don't ask any questions. - Just a moment. - What do you want? Two drinks. Accept my invitation and answer one question. I accept. What's the question? Let's drink first. That gold you sold to Blue, is it part of your wages at the mine? Are you this town's new Sheriff? I thought Miss Brooks paid with dollars. You want an answer? Very well: drop dead! You drank the beer but you didn't answer my question. - Don't run away! - Here! Wait a moment, gorgeous. I'm going to get rid of that fly. Hey ... A fly, huh? I've asked you a question! Very well. I get paid in dollars. You'll never change. Will you give me a drink? A whisky! A whisky, Sammy! From my bottle! Here, Sammy, the best whisky! Don?t bother. I'll pour it on my head, I think my skull is split. Poor you ... If you weren't so arrogant... Guys, the bar is open! - Hey, one beer for me! - One for me too! I don't think there is anyone in the world capable of shooting you. - What do you want? - A quality whisky. Here! A whisky for Johnny! OK, give it to him. You give it to him. Take it. - Don?t you want a drink? - I'm not in the mood. You behaved well last night. I'll buy you a drink later. I see you are feeling better. I'm glad. Thank you. Are you willing to work for me? Let's talk first. Why are you trying to look so ruthless? Just trying to stop people from courting me. Would it be courting you asking how many men work for you? Not counting you, 157. Without counting me, tell me why are you maintaining so many thieves. What? I estimate they are stealing about $1000 a week from you. That's impossible. I've seen your miners exchanging the stolen gold in Mary Blue's Saloon. That can't be. Most of the started working when my father was alive. They have proven to be loyal and honest. Many times they offered to escort the gold shipments. And more than one died in the desert! That was when your father was alive. Now you cannot guarantee 157 men's honesty. Especially the ones that have been hired lately. They are a separate group. It's very strange. Since then, there is unrest in the mine... and there is often fighting. And production has likely decreased. And you probably have more bad news for me! Isn't that so, Mr. Nevada Joe? Or Joe Dexter? Or whatever your name is! Yes. That if I become involved you will stop behaving like a fool. I will give the orders. Listen to me, OK? - I am the only one giving orders here! - Very well. I'm OK with you giving the orders at home. But I will give the orders in the mines! Mary. What are you doing here so early? Sammy, burn that sign! I don't want to see it again! - Burn it? It's very nice. - I said burn it! OK, OK. You are relentless. Tell me, when do you sleep? When I have nothing better to do. My partner didn't like the saloon colour, he wants me to change it. He finds it dull, and he is a happy person. Ah, and he found that the piano needed tuning. Robert ... He just arrived from Dallas. He is a hotel's customer. Will you take care of him? I've been listening for a while. I've said it all. I hope you didn't come just for this! Oh, I forgot. My room is free as of today. Sammy, take all the stuff out from number 20. Very well, I'll take all the stuff out. Stuff up, stuff down. - Was he the bravest of Golden Hill? - He was. Stay away from him, just in case. Listen, boss. As of today, you will obey the new mine security manager. Specifically, he will do the same job as Pete Bailey did. Needless to say I am talking about Nevada Joe. I believe you all know me. Maybe I have a hot temper but I am a straight shooter and I appreciate a man's value. I trust that you are truly willing to obey me. Your salaries will double but in exchange you will defend Miss Brooks' rights at any cost! So ...any concerns? Come on, talk. - Miss Brooks ... - Yes? Don't count on us even if you pay us 10 times as much Why not? We don't want bosses like him! - OK, I'll pay them and they can leave. - No, sir. The mines' security is solely my concern and I won't tolerate anyone interfering, not even you! These men have been loyal and obedient! It's not fair to dismiss them like if they were useless. We had an encounter, which you started. Why don't we shake hands? - I'll do so, what the hell! - Me too! - I've been never left behind! - That's great. Well done. You've made me really happy. I cannot approve mandatory searches! You obviously don't know the miners. They could destroy everything! When I started with your father, Miss Brooks, I was never late. Good morning.... Excuse me. I saw them once destroying everything. Rails, dump cars, hoppers ... Even the barracks were blown apart. Hey, they want to search us at the end of the day. - How do you know? - He wants to be Mr. Important. He also wants the girl and even the mine! What's up. Mexican? I've been trying to find out, they have been meeting for two hours. They're plotting! Surely we will leave the mine this afternoon with our hands up! If they search me it will be ticklish! We just don't take anything today, end of the story! And tomorrow, and the day after, and so for months! Are we going to allow him to spoil our business? - He already beat you in the face. - OK, dig that out! Take this. So where is the money? Shut up! We'll cover you with gold. By showing them they will be searched every day the stealing will stop. Precisely! By all being accused of being thieves, they will find the ones who are doing it. You know the miners are afraid. They are being forced to steal. We must find out who is behind this. Very well. Miss Brooks, I won't have anything to do with this ridiculous farce. Controlling 150miners with 7 men and 7 rifles. And with as much dynamite as necessary. Greer, get a box of sticks! I prohibit you from using those savage methods! Miss Brooks, you say the last word! I already did a few days ago when I put Joe in charge. I fully trust him and I am convinced he will do a way better job than you did. Very well, then go ahead with the dynamite! Here is the slip for one case. Don't bother, lad! I've got the magazine key! - Hey, you could share! - Here, have a drink! Don't move! Watch those hands! You could stain them with blood. Hands up! Pigs! I never liked watchmen, pal! Here! Come on, lazy bum. I won't carry all that by myself. Go to hell. If it was up to me I would have already blown up everything. Get rid of him! Don't move! Don't move! Now is my turn! Huh? Clear the way! I promised myself that you wouldn't steal any more gold. But stealing dynamite is way more dangerous. Let me pass or we will both blow up! - Who will blow up, you crook? - Don't move! Don't you see that I will blow-up your head first? You saw it, Mr. Greer. You can't restrain certain men. You have to let them do things their way. Excuse me, Miss Brooks. But 30 years of loyalty both to you and to your father give me the right to ask. Do you know Nevada Joe's true identity? I don't know what you mean, Mr. Greer. Well, can I make myself clear? Of course. Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings. Just say what you have to say! Nevada Joe is a heartless gunman He is hiding here from the Law and he lives in Golden Hill's hotel. I don't think he is a crook! He is a stranger, so there is nothing special in him living in a hotel. But... Mary Blue, the Saloon owner, also owns the hotel; and she also lives there ... - That isn't true. - How do you know? No, I don't know. And I don't care! Give Mr. Greer some coffee. We're no thieves! We are not on your side! When the dynamite arrives we will see who is with me and who is against me. We'll be searched because of you! - Who's going to search you? All watchmen will be tied-up, like these! And will you be the one tying up Palmer, Taylor and Joe? Yes, it will be me! And I will also spit in their faces! You bastard! What are you waiting for to spit in my face? - Not bad, eh Joe? - One each! - OK, see you later, boss. - There is a bottle for you in the saloon. - Are you going to pick the blonde? - I would love to! That's up to you! Let's go, Blondie! Send it immediately. Of course. That's intolerable. - Come in, Sir. - Thank you. You're 1 hour late. I was trying to avoid you. Don't you know you are repulsive? - Miss Brooks, unless I must stay... - Sit down, please. Mr. Dexter, I want to send to the Capital a large shipment of gold. It must be properly escorted to ensure it will arrive untouched. And of course you won't be using the West Frisco Mail services, right? That's right. Didn?t you already know that? Haven't you noticed that John Randolph's stagecoaches have never been attacked? Why are you asking me? I was asking Miss Brooks, even if I was staring at you. Yes, I've thought about that many times. Well, there is no evidence to judge someone in that way. Maybe those stagecoaches are better protected. - Randolph knows how to scare bandits! - Especially if they are on his payroll. That accusation involves a threat that I wouldn't dare to support. However, I am quite convinced that combining your temperament with Nevada Joe's makes an explosive mix. You may be right. - Maybe I went too far. - Of course! You haven't realized he wants to exploit your inexperience. - Are you nuts? - Let go of him! One day I will answer to your words, Mr. Greer. I'm sorry about what happened, Joe. But ... I no longer know who to trust. So, you still don't know? Then, how am I supposed to show loyalty in this country? Why do you hate me? I don't hate you. I'm just wondering if my efforts are worthwhile. You are not a slave. You are free to leave any time. Even right now! Listen, Julia. You are mistaken if you think you can buy any man; or that all of us were born to serve you. You forget that there is something you can't buy, which is gratitude. I've put my life in danger to help you and you just showed your disdain. You feel too important to show me some gratitude? Did Mr. Dexter expect me to fall in his arms like a saloon girl? Some of those girls are way more polite than you are. Leave this place forever! You are fired! Get out! Wait while I risk my life escorting your gold to the Capital. It would be more practical for you to fire me afterward. I don't want to see you anymore! I said you are fired, so leave this place! Go back to work. - Do you need something, Miss? - I already said that I don't. That's a damned setback. Is that girl crazy? Now that we expected you to solve her problems she goes and ... ...and Nevada Joe, your most dangerous rival with Mary Blue, is back in town! - Are you going to shut up, you brat? - C'mon, uncle.... Doctor ... My rival ... - John Randolph, so late? - Yes, it's him. I stated in Julia's office my full opinion about him. I signed my fate. It's all clear. Greer .... is his accomplice. Hey, where are you going? You tell him, you are more eloquent. - Don't you recognize them? - I know nobody so late in the night! Right now he does not recognize anyone. I never trusted that engineer. Stay here, nobody will find you. Thanks, I have things to do. Some brave men have manners and say good night. - You go to bed! - Uncle....! You Fats, play the piano! I like to hear music while I eat. Answer me: where is he? I know he is back. Where is he? Didn't you hear me? Don't bother, he no longer lives in this hotel. I have to find him at any cost! You know where he is! I've thought of something more convincing, Miss Mary Blue. Money doesn't tempt me. I make lots every day. But like all women of your ilk you dream of retiring one day. Go back to the East and live like a lady. Mr. Randolph, you are much worse than many people think! - Watch your mouth! One day... - What? - If they let me ... - You better watch it, Blue. This town becomes uncomfortable for anyone challenging me. I am not challenging you. I don't need you or called you, you came here after me! Yes, I wanted to see your house. And as you see I've come up with the idea of helping you make money. I don't want to be part of a crime! If you call a crime smashing a damned liar then yes, you will be an accomplice! And if I say no? You live very well, Blue. In luxury. You've got a nice place. It would be a pity if a bunch of drunks were to reduce all this to ashes. Where would you go then, Mary Blue? To that slum in Dallas? I'll be generous. I will increase the fee to $10,000 if we catch your friend tonight. - But it must be tonight. - Joe is not my friend! Even better for you to hand him in to us. Forget about him, gorgeous, and look for a real man. Someone like Vincy. By the way, he will escort you. Yes, he will stay here until that gunman shows up. You will have fun because he has been around. He's a real gentleman. You, take care of her. You can have her when you bring to me Nevada Joe's corpse. Freeze, Nevada! - Vincy is going to be really happy. - Let go of me! Don't touch me! Well, that's a nice catch! Like fallen from heaven. - You'll pay dearly for that wound. - Why did you have to come now? If I don't come you get angry. And if I come ... You fell in a trap. - We don't have to argue about that. - You get out of here! I'll teach you! You ... hit him in the head with a bottle. With this ... the good one? You idiot. Hit him in the head. Yes, sir. Joe ... Look what they did to you. Well, you better don't look in the mirror. That would be better. Joe ... I won't let you leave again. I won't leave you for anything in the world. You can be thankful of your tough skin. - Doctor, I need to leave this place. - Relax. You can't move. I can't move, but I must leave. A few drops of opium, and tomorrow he'll be like new. Hey you, turn around! Joe, Joe, you must drink this. - Will we ever end with that scum? - I don't know. A Sheriff should have arrived one month ago. Joe Dexter is the only one who arrived. And look at him. I wonder ... why are scoundrels so lucky? Luckily he is in your hands. How's that guy, Doctor? How is he, you ask? I can assure you he won't die in bed. - Julia sent you here as watchmen. - No, she doesn't know anything. - We're here because we are his friends. - Aha.... Oh, thank you. - Something amazing happened! - What's the matter with him? Julia Brooks is in the hotel hall, downstairs. - Julia? - You must be drunk. No, Doctor. She is downstairs, and she wants to see him. She can come upstairs. Those two will kill each other. Joe! What are you doing? I'm feeling very well, so I'm going for a walk. - I need some fresh air. - What are you saying? Going now for a walk? Do you know it's dawn? Dawn? - Then ... - You slept again for 10 hours. 3 days ...I've been here 3 days! Yes, 3 days. And you haven't fully recovered. No, that can't be. I can no longer stay here, you have done too much for me. Meanwhile, she has done too little. I told her what happened to you, and she didn't even bother in asking how you were doing. I no longer work in the mines. We argued, and she fired me. Goodbye. Don't be crazy, Joe! You can't stop the gold from falling in Randolph's trap! Let me go, Blue. I must leave. You want to risk your life for a woman who does not deserve anything. Let me go! Yes, of course. As you wish. Mary ... Mary .... Don't hold a grudge against me. A grudge against you? Not even if I wanted to. You know that. I made a useless performance with the intention of keeping you here. And now I really regret having lied to you. I know you will forgive me. Julia was here. Yesterday at night. You're an angel. Thank you, Mary. I will never forget you. - Hi! - Hi! That's the best medicine! When do we start? Right now! Didn't I tell you? Good morning, Miss. - Taylor, you two stay here. - Sure. - Where are you going, you crazy... - Well.... Good morning. You? I believe the mine's owner fired you, right? Yes, that's right. In that case .... - I'm here to congratulate you, Mr. Greer. - I don't understand. You will understand, because I'm talking about your deals with John Randolph. I have lots to do. Vincy and the other one confessed before they died. - I'm an obstacle for you and Randolph. - Well .... I'm willing to disappear immediately, but someone must pay for my trip. My silence is worth ... $10,000. Are you drunk? Me, drunk? I know Miss Brooks would like to know that her engineer is a scoundrel. Don't worry, I'll never tell her. I know she hates me, without knowing I love her from day one. And I would have died for her smile. And what did she do? Se humiliated me whenever she could! Now I no longer care, and she deserves what's happening to her. Well, I'm talking too much. If you give me $10,000 I will leave immediately. Well, sit down. A cigar? No, thank you. - Have you talked with others about this? - No. And you really want to leave Golden Hill? I regret ever coming here! You can make things change. You and I could keep the lion's share. I can no longer stand John Randolph's tyranny! He's insatiable! I have had enough. - OK, but there is something I dislike. - What's that? To sell a business without first sealing one. So ... That's very prudent. Here ... Plus other $10,000 advance for our future business. Wait for me in two hours outside town, by the drinking trough. - Count your cash. - I trust you. Well, Mr. engineer .... Now you will tell us the exact place and time where Randolph will attack our men. Mr. Greer, the wagon is not carrying even a gold flake. How did Greer know the way and the time of the shipment? I made sure he knew so that we could catch John Randolph. I followed your plan. But don't sing victory yet! - Your Sheriff should do the same thing. - Why should I only trust Nevada Joe? And why didn't you take personally revenge on Randolph? And why were you in bed for so long? As far as I know you didn't have any broken bones. Why can't we argue later? We are now wasting precious time. Keep going! We'll go up! Stop now! I said stop! - Greer, see who is coming! - Miss Brooks! - The fireworks will start soon. - They're as restless as a buffalo herd. We'll attack from two sides. Ascott, Palmer and Taylor, this way! You will cut their retreat. Stop! Don't get close to the wagon, OK? You, step down! Where are the guards? I don't know. I don't like this one bit. What's going on? This is very strange. John Randolph! Hand yourself in! Palmer! Don't let the one below escape! Giddyup, horse! Rick! Rick! - I'm furious, Miss Brooks. - Does it hurt? Never mind that. What happened to Randolph? Relax, he won't escape. Joe is after him. You didn't expect me, hey Randolph? I bring regards from Otto Greer. Damn you! You've been lucky. I would have had to shoot you if it wasn't because there is a new Sheriff in Golden Hill. - Get him, boys! - With pleasure! Come here! - Let me go! - Come with us! Here is the up nose guy! Here he is. You can be happy. You started yesterday and you already caught two big fish. Yes, I know he counts as two. - I was talking about Otto Greer. - Otto Greer? He, too? Here. When you open the barrack you will find him tied up on top of the desk. There is one thing I don't like, Joe Dexter: your bad memory. - You are ...? - Jim Stone. Your father's deputy in Dodge. Of course! Remember when you taught me this? Yes, you learned that too fast. Well ... Arizona is across the mountains. I really must go there. This has become too peaceful. And you have no longer fun. Well, remember that Stone has an interim assignment. I could nominate you as Golden Hill's Sheriff. - Do you think I will trade my freedom for a metal badge? Even if you don't want to ... it's in your blood. OK then. But doing the same thing with no protection ... gives me more satisfaction. Good luck, Julia. Wait! A moment ago, you proposed to me. - You don't want to hear the answer? - When did I propose to you? Well, you did when talking to Otto Greer. But I heard you. And since when do you believe Joe Dexter, or Nevada Joe? - Answer me. - Since I love you. English subtitles by O Cangaceiro
