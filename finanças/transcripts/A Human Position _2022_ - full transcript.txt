THIS YEAR'S HOLIDAY SUBSTITUTES - Hi Asta, you're back? - Hello, yes I am. - Good to see you again. - You too. - You're working all summer? - That's the plan. Same with you? Yes. Not bad having some veterans among all the subs. I'm probably a bit rusty though... But it's usually quiet during the summer. It will be fine, you'll get right back into it. So the key to get enthusiasm among fans back would be results on the pitch? Results are always important, but it goes both ways. Enthusiasm from fans is important for good results, but yes, enthusiasm is also relying on good results. What are your thoughts on the season so far? Shit. But this is not black and white. Ålesund depends on the art nouveau architecture for tourism, and it is under heavy scrutiny that rich real estate developers decide what and where to build. It's like they have a direct line to the city. So you're saying there might be corruption? Well, I'm not sure, but this is all very unfair. Okay, thank you, I think we got it. - Can you take some pictures? - Yes. Lets take some group photos. Feel free to hold the signs up. That's it. You in the back, could you take a small step to your left? Perfect. Should we get rid of some stuff up here, perhaps? As in throw out? Yes, or just tidy up? Sure, no problem. If you show me, I can help you renovate some chairs? That could work. Asta, Asta, Asta Asta, Asta, Asta She really wants to remove, all-of-the-chairs Asta, Asta Gonna sleep in bed tonight? Hmm, I think I need to sleep on the floor for now. Am I missing out on something? True love. It's three in the morning, and I'm standing in the middle of… Which one did you write? The one about preserving green spaces and art nouveau architecture. Page five, I think. “Complaints dismissed for preservation of green space - dispensation given for modern architecture among the art nouveau” That's kinda shitty. But I probably wouldn't go demonstrate either... What about you? No… When someone can profit on building there, it seems useless… Don't think it would help. What about this one, isn't this from the big case a while back? From that factory? Don't think I wrote that. What article is that? The one in the corner here: “Asylum seeker affected in social dumping incident - to be forcibly returned” Great. Could you try presenting the ship with your hands? That's it, great! Perhaps we can use the first ones? I don't like arms up and stuff. They usually do well... Yes? Well, just don't forward them if you can. - Okay, I'll get back. - Thank you! Sorry for the wait, but the pictures look great. Could you tell me about the new plans for the summer? Sure. In this situation it's important to retain the products already in play, from our members in the Ålesund Cruise Network. So basically, we have to take care of what we have so we don't have to rebuild everything from scratch. What kinds of products do you offer? We have a huge variety of attractions here in the city: museums, the Atlantic Sea-Park, Kayaking, the hill top view, art nouveau architecture, the galleries... - Hi. - Hi. - The articles were great. - That's good. I'll just forward them for publication right away. Great. Good to be back? Yes, everything's back to normal. I'm sorry... Hey, you know that little article the other day, about the asylum seeker stuff? - Yes. - Do you know who wrote it? We actually got it from Joakim. As you know he's retired now... - Yes… Do you have his number? - Just a second… Joakim Ytre: 47 - 83 - 94 - 27. Hi, it's Asta Østrem from Sunnmørsposten. How's… life? That's nice. I talked to Anne, she told me you have a contact at that factory, concerning the forced returned asylum seeker, is that correct? Do you think I can get the contact info and follow up? Great, yes e-mail is perfect. Right. I feel there is something there, something more. Aslan… No last name? - You know what? - No. When we were there a long time ago, we ate out all the time, right. They had these vending-looking machines to place your order. Yes, I know. - But it's cool, right. - Yes. Because all the items on the menu had pictures, but all the items had the same pictures. Yes, I know because you've told me hundreds of times. I still think it's cool. Will there be judo later? We'll have to wait and see. Did you know the Siesta chair from Relling is the most sold Norwegian chair in Japan? Well except for Tripp Trapp, that is… - The one in there? - Mhm. Or wait, I don't actually know that... But I think so? Does it make any sense to you? No... We should do this weekly again. Agree. - Hi, ready? - I'm ready. In this tub, we put dried/salted cod, potatoes, and other ingredients and mix them. We then bring it to this assembly station for partial packing, before sending the bacalhau to that room for 2.5 hours of heat treatment. It then ends up on this packing station for completion, followed by distribution to our suppliers. This actually used to be Aslan's station… Are you still in touch with him? No… He sort of disappeared. Didn't hear more from him. A lot was set in motion here. Nobody knew, or considered the consequences for those without work permits. I wish we did, but… We thought we did good. How was he, Aslan, as a person? Aslan was a hard worker, and did his job well. He was selfless, both at work and outside, and seemed to thrive on helping others. He was a really great guy. That chair... is it possible to buy it? It's all going to the tip, take it if you want it. Really? It probably reeks of fish. By the way, Aslan actually loved it. Used it as his lunch break chair. What's with the cheeky look? Nothing... As a kid, I used to love birds. You did? Actually, I collected birds' eggs. - You're shitting me. - No. I climbed trees, picked an egg, super careful. I even brought them down in my mouth cause I need my hands for climbing, right. Just shoved in there... Then we blew out the insides through small holes, and put them in small boxes with cotton. A cute little collection of eggs. - It's a bit sick. - Is it? Why didn't I know this? Not sure. Want to help me adopt a chair? It's a bit peculiar that we sit on chairs, isn't it? Ehm, yes? Like... humans, that we sit, on chairs. Can't think of another animal that sit on chairs… What's the name of this model? I think it's something like "no. 69"... Or "no. 67". Isn't it a bit strange if it's called 69? Don't think they thought about that then… Ah, of course not, they didn't have sex back then. Not the expression, you idiot... - Dammit... - Are you okay? Can we take a break? Ålesund City Hall Hi, I have Asta Østrem from Sunnmørsposten here. Could you tell me who sits on info about asylum seekers and such? Yes, okay. So, the city plays no part in it? And the county has nothing to do with it? Or, a little? Application process goes through UDI and they are divided into regional offices? And then the city gets involved? “The city commits to settle people on request from the government?” But doesn't the county work with local asylum reception centres? They don't? Okay, can you? He has some time to see you in about 20 minutes. That's okay, I can wait. She can wait. Thanks. Asta? I'm sorry, I won't be of much help. But here's a business card of Dagfinn at Tingvoll asylum reception center. - He can probably help you. - Okay, thank you... The city only gets involved when asylum seekers get permanent residence, and help with housing and/or work. Okay, I understand. Thank you. You're welcome. - Hello. - Hi. So you can't tell me anything about Aslan's case? No we can't, unfortunately. We have very strict restrictions on disclosing information about our residents, former or present. It has to do with the safety of the residents. But you can confirm he has been a resident here? Yes, I can. So, when people arrive, what do they receive in terms of services, etc.? At this center they get offered a room, a private room actually. They get access to kitchen appliances, a shared kitchen, and a public area for each corridor, shared with up to eight others. We also have other public areas around the center, café, and... Could you put your arm up... That's it. Great. Should we take some pictures outside as well? Sure, no problem. What is... the best thing about Norway? - Like, for real? - Yes. I'm not sure… Mountains? A-ha? I was thinking more about society, the welfare state and such... I often think that, we're not allowed to complain about it. Since it works as well as it does... Or at least when things are as good as they are for us. On the other hand, it would be stupid not to fight to preserve it. Why do you ask? It's just that case I'm working on. I can't seem to find the right approach, or position to take. It feels so immense, but at the same time so impenetrable and neglected. It's healing very well. Very well. Hi, Asta Østrem calling from Sunnmørsposten. I'm looking for the contact info for an asylum seeker that arrived in Norway around ten years ago. He's now been forcibly returned, or waiting to be. Is this something you can help me with? You can't... Nobody else either? No, I don't know, that's why I'm calling... Okay, I understand. By the way, could you describe the process from asylum seeker to forcibly returned? Okay, I have a hypothetical situation, if that helps? Let's say the person arrived in Norway ten years ago. He integrates well, even gets a temporary work permit, and for years he works in a factory until it gets shut down for severe breaches of the labour law. What the person wasn't told at this time, was that his work permit had expired. So when the factory was shut down, he went down with them. Got accused and charged for working illegally. Yes. Yes, let's say this led to his final appeal for asylum being rejected. So this is not an unusual situation? I see. “As long as there is a legal basis, the government acts on principle”, is that what you said? Can I use that quote? Seven people have been brought to the hospital for smoke damage. The condition of the four directly involved in the accident are reported as critical, but stable. How is traffic now, and when will it be back to normal? The tunnel has opened, but there is a convoy still. Not sure when traffic is back to normal. We'll know more tomorrow. Great, I think that's all. Should we take a few pictures? That's great. Great, perhaps we can take a few without the smile and thumbs up, since it's an accident? Confronting our social conscience Okay, ready! No way... Fucking hell, are you shitting me!? What!? Where did you find it? It's so cool... It's that chair, Asta. The one! I know. Fucking hell… - Wanna sit? - Ehm, yes? It's so fucking cool... You should check the label under. Bjørn Engø, at Møre Lenestolfabrikk. Imported design. Manufactured locally. Now we know, finally. I have a gift for you as well. You do? Ready? Troubled days, seem unending Safety, always pending There's no goal post in sight Only checkpoints of light I go carefully through every day I wish there was, anything I could say I never thought I'd see you so blue But there's nothing else I, would wanna do Than be with you No matter what we go through And I don't know what to do But I'm still me, and you're still you Thank you.
