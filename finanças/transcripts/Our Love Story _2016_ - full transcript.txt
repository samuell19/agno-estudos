You've all checked out the gallery? "If you haven't done it yet, you should do it after this meeting." On the first floor, Se-a, in Section A. Jin-Yong, in Section B. Byung-ki, in Section D. Professor Kim? "I'm planning to display the images of metaphysical aesthetics," using a projector. "For that, Section C is better than Section D." "I think it'll be all right. They're the same thing." Just work with it. Yoon-ju can have Section C. Did I miss anyone? "Concentrate on the exhibition as well as on your piece." That's all for today. I feel grief. Yoon-ju, this is why I feel so alone. "But apparently, Prof. Kim adores you." You should play fair and square. He said he's thought it over. What's wrong? Are you jealous? Am I jealous? "You're talking about the Mighty Jang Byung-ki here." Jealous? Whatever. Hello. I can only pay by the weight. "If you want to get more money, go to the used bookstore." It's all right. Thank you. Did you find anything? Yes. I was wondering if you have any wooden boards? "This isn't a recycling shop. What do you need them for?" "You really use the stuff you take from here?" Yes. Don't take the expensive ones. "I can't believe you're still seeing him after the fight." What? "Despite all the fights, there's one thing I still like about him." Like what? Don't be coy with me. You know. Stop that. "You like it that much? I don't know." "It's because you haven't met a good lover." When you keep on doing it, you'll find your match. I think he's here. That took you long enough. I'm so sorry, baby. You're so dead. "- Hi, Yoon-ju. - Hello." How have you been? Good. I knew we'll get back together. How's your piece coming along? "- I should visit your workroom. - You're a disgrace." Go to my room. "- Young-eun. - Yeah?" "- I need to give you the rent. - It's okay. Take your time." "I'm going to bed and he's staying over. Night." Yoon-ju. "Looks like you've been working hard." "My artwork belongs inside those buildings." "Yet, I'm a mere construction worker, pumping nicotine into my lungs." "What was my dad doing when everyone else was working hard?" I envy Se-a. But Se-a is not that good. "Being good has to do with one's ability." "One's ability is about having good connections." "I need soju instead of coffee on a day like this." Let's go out drinking after work. "You could've bought a house with your booze money." "After all I've taught you, you're still hopelessly unromantic." "How can you compare booze to a house?" "Shit. I still need to pay my rent this month." Hey, you. Hi. What's that? I found it on the way here. Aren't you exhausted? How do you manage it all? Yoon-ju? "How's it going? You've found something?" No, I'm still looking around. You do have something. I'm jealous. Hi, Yoon-ju. "You're in luck. Have you had dinner?" Yes, I have. Come and have some. "We should've ordered some more. Right?" Please have a seat. Here are new chopsticks. Thank you. I'll go sit next to my lady. "We can do some serious bonding over chicken, you know?" "Baby, then we can come out to the living room, right?" "- We're already out here. - You know what I mean." Eat up. Yoon-ju. Seriously, why don't you date? Who're you saving yourself for? I'm not saving myself. She doesn't date? You don't date? "Some of you, artsy people, date like crazy and go nuts." She's almost a nun. "Are you sure there's nothing wrong with you?" It's not easy to meet someone. "I have this friend. He's really cool." Are you interested? "He's good-looking, tall and thick-haired." "- Who? - Remember Jung-su?" He's pretty good-looking. Yes, he is. Yoon-ju, you should meet him. I don't have time. You can make time to date. If you won't see him, I will. This chicken tastes really bad. It's so tough. It tastes fine to me. How did you two meet? Us? "It was fate that brought us together." Shit. "- What? - You're a disgrace." So what do you think? I'm not sure if I have time to do that too. We can work on it together. I'm not asking to work for free. "You'll get paid and get to travel for the overseas exhibitions." "Everyone else is dying to do it. You sure you don't want the job?" Yes, sir. "All right. Your opinion is most important." I understand. I'm sorry. You don't need to be. I'll see you later. Hello. "A pack of Dunhill Fine Cut Frost, please." Sure. Can I see your ID? I didn't bring one. I need to see your ID. "I bought a pack from here yesterday." You don't remember me? No, I need to see your ID. You sold me a pack yesterday. I can bring my ID later. I'm sorry. I always buy my cigarettes here. I'll take one of those also. The cigarettes? Yes. Can I see your ID? Here. She's being so uptight. Do I look that young? Can't she tell? Do you live nearby? My part-time work is near here. "Drop by sometime. I'll buy you a beer." After all, you bought me this. "Go down this street and you'll run into a corner." "Take left and there's the restaurant." Please come by. What's up? How's it going? "This is no joke. You're talking to Mr. Jang Byung-ki." I'm on a roll. What's up? "If you were stuck, I wanted to get a drink." Only if you want to. Se-a, Yoon-ju wants to get drunk. Wow. That's highly unusual. How can I resist? "For you? Of course, I will." Since you brought it up, you pay. "I was wondering when you were going to say that." For once, you pay. "I was gonna pay. Come!" I'm freezing. Where is this place? Where? Right here. "- Here? - Geez." Let's go in. It's freezing. "Girls, quietly, get up. It's too expensive here." Let's go somewhere else. No, it's cold outside. We'd like to order, please. One Thai skirt steak salad. "One Basil pork stir-fry and one seafood noodle soup, please." "I'm not letting you off the hook this time." "We just want one fish cake soup, please." "Don't you know anything about "noblesse oblige"?" You're rich. You should pay. "How do you know whether I'm rich or not?" I know you are. Whatever. Hello. Hello. Who was that? Just a girl I know. Stop checking her out. You're so immature. You really came. My friends wanted to go out. Did you drink a lot? No. Your face is red. It's unfortunate. That I can't hang out with you. Have fun tonight. Okay. "This stall doesn't lock so be careful." Thank you. "Be honest. I know you're only drawing for the money." I can see right through you. "It's so hideous. You shouldn't do that." "What do you mean by I only draw for the money?" How can you say that? You're ridiculous. "I think it's your inferiority complex talking." Se-a, stop it. Why can't I say what I want? "Yoon-ju, we're not fighting. Se-a and I are just talking." Se-a. What I'm trying to say is, "an artist should not work for the sake of money." Your intention is not pure. You still don't understand, do you? Why do you assume that I do? Did I do that on purpose? How do you know? "- Yoon-ju. - Yeah." You also think I'm like that? No. What's wrong with you? Talk when you're sober. Se-a. Let's do art, not politics. Se-a! Shit. Se-a! Byung-ki is drunk. Whatever. "Your friends are lightweights, aren't they?" They're not usually like that. I'm sorry about today. "Things can happen when alcohol is involved." It's better that way. You look so different. What? I thought you're a tough gal. You bought me cigarettes. Or are you a spontaneous type? "No, I'm not. It was frustrating to watch you that night." I'm joking. I can be a bit too forthcoming. Holy shit. Can you walk? Is he okay? Yes. Shit. Thank you very much. Hey, it's Yoon-ju. I'd better get going. See you tomorrow. Bye. Today was interesting. I'm really sorry. "I didn't know that my credit card isn't working." "If you're truly sorry, you can pay me back later." "- Bye. - Bye." Hello? Who is this? Oh, hello. Hey, get in. Okay. It's really late. I'm sorry. It's okay. Are you sure you weren't asleep? Yes. Your voice said otherwise. I really wasn't asleep. My voice was a bit hoarse. "I felt bad because I thought I woke you up." Let's say that you weren't asleep. Okay. "My part-time job ends late at night so I have no sense of time." It must be tough working so late. It's not so bad. I just need to make some drinks. You're a bartender? "I usually work at this other bar and not the one you saw me in last time." That place is a piece of cake. "I saved this bottle of wine for the special someone." And here, I'm drinking it with you. You don't have a boyfriend? A boyfriend? "Do you think I'd have a boyfriend?" You didn't mention anything. I have no clue. You're not dating anyone? No. I thought you knew. "You've been living here for a long time?" Since college. "I've grown fond of this place. It's too bad." Are you moving? Yes, I'm moving back home. Actually, my mom was very ill last year, and she passed away. So "I'll be staying with my dad for a while." I'm ruining the mood. Tell me about yourself. I want to hear your voice. It's freezing. "Did you know that it's colder at dawn?" "It's too cold. I don't think taxis will come." You want to sleep over? Wait a second. Did you sleep well? I want to do it. I don't. Be still. You know what? Are you okay? Yeah. How can we eat all these? I want you to be well fed. Well fed? For what? You go to church? Yeah. I was born a Christian. Really? I had no idea. What do you pray about? Things like "Thank you"? Thank you? Thank you. Dig in. Okay. What are you staring at? "I wanted to see which side dish you eat first." Let's dig in. This place is awesome. Who did you come here with? With my 77th woman? That's wrong. "I was practicing in order to meet you." "You sure you don't need to go in for work?" You want me to go? Fine, I'll go. That's not what I meant. I was worried. It's okay to slack off a little. Come and sit next to me. Okay. "- What are you looking at? - What?" People are watching. Who's watching? I bet someone did. It doesn't matter. I need to use the bathroom. No, don't go. Okay. Hurry back. Hurry. Boo! Shit. "- How are you? - Good." "- Let's go. - Yeah." When did you come back? About two weeks ago. "- Two weeks ago? - Yeah." Why haven't you called me? "You're lucky that I at least called you now." Whatever. You look prettier. Really? "- I'm joking with you. - Punk!" Why is it so cold in Seoul? "You haven't lived long enough in Busan to feel cold in Seoul." "Is your girlfriend staying with you?" "Is she still suspicious about us?" Hardly. We broke up half a year ago. "- Really? - Yeah." "You moved in with her. I thought you two were getting married." "Why did you stay in Busan after you broke up with her?" I couldn't come home penniless. "I couldn't afford a place so I stayed at her place for a few months." Wow. Shit. "You should've just found a studio apartment." That also costs money. "It's such a pity, being so close one minute and cold the next." "Besides, she's got a new boyfriend." You're unbelievable. I don't want to talk about this. "I haven't seen you in so long. Let's talk about something else." What's up with you? "From what I see, you're still not dating." What is it? You met someone? Who is the guy? What does he do? Is he tall? Is he rich? "Do you have to end every sentence with "guy"?" Who is the bastard? Are you serious? It's a girl? Are you serious? Yeah. What? If you're just curious, "or if it's because of your artistic tendencies," you might be just exploring. "- Hey. - What?" I really like her. I think I understand a little now. "I can't stop you, if that's what you want." Who is the girl? Why do you want to know? "What's wrong with wanting to know?" Yummy. Geez. Aren't you cold? Why didn't you wait inside? I'm not cold at all. How was work? Uh-oh. You've been drinking? With who? The Barfman? A friend. A friend? "You said you'll be working, but you went out drinking." I told my friend that I have a girlfriend. He's really curious about you. Let's go out together next time. "If you're not careful about this, you'll lose friends." He's not that kind of person. Wait. What is this? I wanted to please you. You are drunk. It's so cold. It is cold. Let's get inside. I have to get up. Let's sleep a little longer. Shall we? Yeah. Just a little longer. You can't reach her? I called but... "Yoon-ju is so exhausted with her work lately." I think she's on her way. "Yoon-ju is the only one with the print shop number?" "What's wrong with you guys? You should share information." "Your part-time is too far, and it's dangerous at night." Should I pick you up after work? You're overreacting. They're paying for the cab. "I get dropped off right in front of my place." Taxi can also be dangerous. Then should I just stay home? "Are you going to give me allowance?" Should we move in together? I can pay rent. The rent on the place isn't much. And I'm moving back home soon. That's right. You have to move, right? Never mind. "Don't you need to go to school today?" I don't have any classes today. "From now on, I just need to work on my exhibition." Shit. What's with you? "I had so much faith in you and you ditch a meeting?" Is something wrong? "I wasn't feeling well and had to go to the clinic." "We have a lot of sick people here." Everyone is just sucking it up. "You know that I've invited some influential people for this event." Yes. Don't forget that. "If you can't handle them all, assign it to others." Okay. Today? I'm going to be late tonight. I have a lot of work to do. I'm sad too. No. You know what? "I'll finish it up here fast and be there." Okay. Bye. Shit, girl. I'm sorry. What're you sorry for? "- I... - Let's just work." Ji-soo. "Leave that and come drink with us." I need to get home early tonight. Really? "Then just finish up the glasses and go home." Okay. Can we please talk? Talk. You're finished, right? Let's go. I'll wait for you outside. Talk here. I won't be long. "I can't take your call. Please call again." Ji-soo. Are you home? Ji-soo. Hey. Wake up. Take off your clothes and sleep. Hello? Are you feeling all right? Yeah, I'm fine. "Do you remember what happened last night?" Yeah. "Who did you drink with? You left your door open." With who? Why didn't you answer my call? A regular at the bar stopped by. "And why would you have drinks with the bar regular?" Why would you do that? That's not part of your job. What're you saying? Ji-soo. Can't you get another job? Or work during the day? Work closer to home? I'm sorry, but "I won't get drunk anymore. Don't tell me where to work." I can take care of myself. "I want to spend the day alone today." Tada. How's this? Nope. This is not it? Take a good look. No. They all look the same to me. This isn't as easy as I thought. I just need my laptop for work. When is your exhibition? Don't you two go on dates? "When are you going to show me your girlfriend?" What do you mean? What do you like about her? "Let's get together sometime soon for a drink." I want to see her. I'll buy. "Why do you want to drink with her?" "I'm asking to drink together, not just with her." Why would you say that? What? I'm at my workroom. Hey, you. What're you doing there? "Are you going to keep standing here?" I'm going in. Let's get inside. Come on. Come on, baby. Isn't it cold outside? It's freezing. Move. No. Stop it. It's gotten a lot better. "The placement is great and the color scheme is also good." "I thought you have another one. Is it a series?" Yes, it is. I'll show you when I'm done. Sounds great. What has become of Ms. Kim? Is this all? "No, I'm going to string the lid and lower it a bit more." I'm not finished yet. "So what am I supposed to say to this?" There's nothing to comment on. Is this a junkyard? "You call bringing materials together, art?" "I think all that praising went to your head." I'll speak to you privately later. Okay. Maybe I should do housework. "Don't you think I'll be good at it?" Housework? Where did you get that idea? I'm a good cook. I should do what I'm good at. You're being silly. What's wrong? Nothing. Are you asleep? I guess you are. It's weird. What's weird? "I lived here for 5 years, yet it feels so unfamiliar." Oh yeah? "Maybe it's because all your stuff is out." "You think you'd ever want to move in with me?" What? You know... What we have right now is good. It is good. Are you feeling anxious? No. You're not moving away too far. "Should we do it to celebrate moving?" Let's do it to celebrate. I'm so glad you're here. Now, it feels like a real home. You should've moved in sooner. Isn't it too cold to go hiking? It's not so cold. "You should work out too and eat more." You look really pale. I do eat a lot. "So this isn't so bad, is it? I know it's nothing like Mom's." "Come on. Why don't you come hiking with me?" It's not so high. I'll go some other time. When it gets warm. Okay, sweetie. Why didn't you take the express? It would've been much faster. I didn't know. You look like your mom. Really? Is this your room? It looks so different from here. Let's get out of here. What? Where? It's cold outside. It's stuffy in here. Come on. "How much farther do we have to go?" Are you tired? I'm exhausted. I'll push you from the back. This hasn't changed a bit. You've been here a lot? "I came here a lot when I was little." "I came here for field trips and with my mom and dad." You want one? No thanks. I'll smell like cigarette smoke. "I wish we could've had lunch together." I'm sorry. It's okay. "I'll go to Seoul next time. Let's eat something nice then." Have a safe trip home. See you later. Let me see that. "Why are you still working on the strings?" How does this look? I want it lower. Yeah? Hang on. "- Hold on to this. - Okay." How's this? Like this. I think this looks good. Hang on. I'll tie it for now. You secure it later, okay? "- Hold on to this. - Okay." What're you doing with the color? I like how the raw materials look. I want to leave it as it is. Like this? "There's no unifying theme like this." Let's color it. You called? What's up? I've got a lot of work to do. Yeah. You were in Seoul? Oh. I'm sad that I missed it. "All right. Get home safe." Okay. How was your day? Hi. The food there was great. They had a big variety of dishes. I wish we could've gone together. "Everyone had a date and you could've eaten there too." "I'm glad that you had a good time." "Young people nowadays get married without a marriage officiant." "The bride and groom just walked in together." It's nice and simple. "But fathers should give away their daughters." "There's only two of us to walk down the aisle." That's what I'm saying. You should meet many men. "So you can pick one from the bunch." Your studies are important. "But I can't believe that you've never had a boyfriend." "If you have time to meet your friends," you should go find a boyfriend. "You can always see your friends later." "Timing is important for marriage." You remember Mr. Kwon? He says he knows a good boy. "Why don't you go on a date with him?" I don't need a boy. If your mom was alive, "I would've used her as an excuse." "What were you going to do if I didn't turn my phone on?" But I knew you would turn it on. I think my mouth is frozen. Let's get inside. It's cold. How can you be so stupid? Am I stupid? Yeah. Are you feeling better? Yeah. I think you have a fever. "You want to take some medicine for that?" No thanks. Get warmed up. I need to take a shower. It's cold today. "What're you doing home so early?" "I was in the neighborhood for work" "and thought I should have lunch with you." You haven't had lunch yet, right? It's braised monk fish. I know you love this stuff. "A new restaurant opened down the hill." "I've been there once and it was pretty good." Why are you just staring? What's wrong? Hello, sir. Hello. Is she the one at the funeral? No, Dad. I see. "I thought Ji-soo takes after her mother," but I think she takes after you. Really? How do you know my Ji-soo? Oh, that... She's a good friend. "Seoul is quite far from here. You've come a long way." I asked to borrow a book. I see. "How could you make someone come down here for a book?" You could've bought it. What don't you pick up? May I ask how old you are? I'm thirty-two. Thirty-two. "You must be thinking about marriage." Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. "Your parents must have no worries." "I don't know why Ji-soo doesn't date." Can't sleep? "I'm having coffee. Would you like some?" Yeah. "- Here. - Thanks." What's wrong? It's nothing. Young-eun. Yeah? I have something to tell you. What is it? What is it? What's with you? What's eating you up inside? "Why didn't you tell me from the beginning?" "I didn't know that I was supposed to tell you." We are living together. "You might've been okay but I might not have." What do you think? I like this one better. Having potential is important, "but completeness of the work is also important." All parents worry. "If we didn't meet like this, things could've gotten worse." "I'm just here to have fun. Is that all right with you?" "Is there somewhere you'd like to go?" Why don't we go for a drive? What's wrong? Why don't you even say hello? "Why are you treating me like I'm invisible?" What did I do? What have I ever done to you? "What is it that I did that's so wrong?" It's 11 pm. You still have bus home? I'll walk you there. Let's go. "It's okay. I've checked the bus schedule earlier." I can still go home. Let's have one more drink. It's on me. Excuse me. We're okay. Let's drink later. "Let's just stay for 10 more minutes." 5 minutes? Have I told you about this? "I have this friend who is really funny..." Let's go. You'll miss your bus. Let's talk later. I can go alone. I want to see you get on the bus. It's okay. The bus will be here soon. I'll call you when I get home. It's cold. Get home. Don't turn your phone off again. Get home safe. Yeah. Bye. I'm home. Have you had dinner? Yes. "It's really cold out there. Don't be late coming home." Okay. Hello? Hey. Of course I'm home. Are you on the bus? What? I missed you. I missed the last bus. Tada. "Why don't you say anything? You're scaring me." Aren't you happy to see me? No? Let's go. Okay. "- How much is it? - It's $30." Here's your key. Do you want some water? I'm all right. "Get some sleep. You must be tired." What? I should've left earlier, right? Lock up before you go to sleep. Kim Yoon-ju. "Why are you drinking in the middle of the day?" Why does time matter? "How can you write with no creativity?" "It's a surprise hearing that from you." What's going on? Nothing. "Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?" Let's talk about something else. All right. What's it to you? Pour me a shot. Fine. Drink up. I hope you brought your wallet. "Because I'm gonna get drunk today." All right. Let's try. Are you okay? Wake up. Let's go. You're such a lightweight. Hey, drink this. I can't do a lot of things. I can't drink too much. I'm no good at art. "I can't say the things I want to say." Are you all right? "You know I care about you very much." What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you sure about this? Yes. "I'll help you with your work this semester," "and I'll work on mine next semester." That's fine with me. But still... "Well, it's not written in stone that you have to do this now." "You get one shot. Take your time. A lot of people are watching." Yes. "We don't have to go far. Should we eat around here?" "There are many good restaurants around here." What would you like to eat? Sang-kyu. "Have you done anything bad in your life?" Anything bad? "I'm not sure. Nothing comes to my mind." "I stole some cash from my mom when I was in primary school?" Is that considered bad? How about you? Lying? What's wrong with lying? Who hasn't done it? I'm quite disappointed. "I was expecting something more serious." Lying. Everyone lies. Will you take me to Seoul? Long time no see. Why don't you sit next to me? Are we sitting separately now? Okay. Then I'll go sit with you. Go back to your seat. I don't want to. Did you miss me? You did miss me. Wanna kiss? My last bus has left. There are still more buses. "Then I'll wait until there is none left." "Why are you acting so stiff today?" "Won't you buy me cigarettes today?" It's good to hold your hand. "I've never been to your place before." Did you make this? This is amazing. You want some water? You take the bed. Lose the coat. I missed you. Our Love Story
