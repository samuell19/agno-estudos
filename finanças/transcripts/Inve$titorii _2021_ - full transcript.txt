We still have an audit? I don't know, I'm on acquisitions. -What's with this rose? -What rose? This one. Tavi, quit playing around. I think you have a secret admirer. And who could this secret admirer be? Did you happen to see him? I don't know, but I think he's one of those well built guys, smart, handsome, with a devastating smile. -Did Dorian Popa come by? -You killed me. -Did you hear the news? -I did. Yeah, and with the striker suspended I still think we'll end in a tie. Not that, the delegation of investors. Stoian is wandering the halls with some French guys. -And? -And, aren't you happy? If they buy us you could be promoted to Intra-European acquisitions. -Yeah? -Yeah. Mr. Eugen, how are you? Did you learn how to write? Horsey, are you spying on me or doing quality control? -Workers' protection? What is it? -God forbid! But what are you doing here? -I'm working, man. -How? What are you up to, inspecting the assembly line? Anything? Mr. Eugen, I know how dedicated you are to this job. Under your watch how could anything less than the best quality come out on that conveyer belt? Well done. I made the dinner reservation for tonight, okay? Oh, man, the game! Hey, be careful with what you're about to say. Guys, so, Silvi and I agreed that if I have personal plans, I have to let her know at least 24 hours ahead of time. So, I can't… So, is she your wife or your boss? What's the difference? Horsey, buddy, do you have any idea how the economy works? Silvi will kill me. Do you think these guys are playing for nothing? We have to drink beer. If we don't drink beer, how are the guys at the beer factory gonna get paid? Man, did you really not think about their families? -I'm sorry, were you saying something? -No, go ahead. Do you want those families to suffer? They have kids, they have dogs, they have kitchen roaches. -Silvi will still kill me. -Come on. -Great, it's settled. Cast it. -And… One, two, three, go. Check it out, it's a big one. What are they doing there? Something special? It's… it's for luck! Let's go to work. For anything in particular? It's just… It's Romanian tradition. Good day, sir. They also applaud at landing, it's a Romanian tradition. -So this is a Romanian tradition? -Yes. That's what it is. Shall we continue? Come on, they'll put you on the five o'clock news! -No, man, I don't think so. -Come on. -How's it going? -Good afternoon. Hello. How do you feel about the French are downsizing? -I say go for it! -Really? Sure, Romanians don't do anything in this country. Let the foreigners do it, they can do the roads, they can do the downsizing, they can do… They can increase wages for the people! Tell them even sugar's gotten more expensive. Get out of here, man, get going! What do you have to say about the fact that one of the conditions is laying off 400 employees? That's great. There's no way they'll fire me, I have six kids, four with the same mom. What do you have to say to your kids, now that their dad will be unemployed? What was that? Get out of here! Are you angry with the company's management? I'm angry at you! Who said you could film me? Who gave you permission? -Come on, go! -Yeah, get out of here! What's your back-up plan? My back-up plan? To shove this down your throat. -Get out of here! -Who gave you permission? -Who did? -Hey, Horsey! -Take it easy. -Pieces of shit! -What's wrong? Calm down. -Why did you knock down my scooter?! I thought it was theirs. LIITLE PARIS IN THE HEART OF ROMANIANS What do you have to say to your kids, now that their dad is going to be unemployed? Who said you could film me? Hey, stop filming me! Get out of here! Bravo, man! Foreigners can't just do whatever they want in our country! Because if King Stefan the Great, when he stood down the Turkish Pasha, if he'd been okay with downsizing, you know, we wouldn't even have laid down arms in '44, and now? -Don't even think about it. -Come on, Eugene, put the game back on! -Okay, hang on. -Fuck the news! -Go. -Hang on. Get it! That's it! -There we go. -It's all us, boys. -Go. -They're kicking first, right? No, your mother. -What are they doing? -It was so close. It was right there. -Who's got it? -Ionita, of course. -Come on, Gica, yes! -Let's go. Get ready. Hang on. Go. And goal! -Well done! -My God. -Now if he misses, we win, right? -That's it. Come on, that's it! Go team, go Craiova! We really worked today. Do I smell like alcohol? If I smell like alcohol, Silvi will kill me. Man, if anyone has the nerve to fire you… I'll turn in my resignation. They're nothing without us. No way, man, there's no way they'd fire people with our experience. How are they gonna get rid of me, of you… us? That's right. We have to let you go. The new investors are reducing personnel by 40%. Too bad. Well, that's market economy, right? You know, I've got someone in mind. You guys know Razvan, the fat guy? I keep saying, "look at that guy, look how slow he is!" No. Razvan is staying. He's minimum wage. We have to let you go. What do you mean you're letting me go? It wasn't an easy decision. But I'm glad you're handling this in a mature way. I'll knock you right out, jackass. I know where you live. I'll get you taking out the trash. You can't fire me. I'm in the union. Unfortunately the union can't do anything because there isn't a collective work agreement. Collective work agreement? Yes. If you had signed a collective work agreement I could've worked something out, but now… Maria spits in the soup! That cook lady who works in the cafeteria! Why do you think I don't eat the soup on Tuesdays? Because she spits in the soup! Why don't you fire her? I thought the factory was doing well, that things were looking up. Well, even so. It's because of everyone's hard work that we haven't failed. We've even turned a profit. That's why the French are taking over. -Because of how well it's going? -Exactly. It's called capitalism, right? And for it to go even better we need to adjust our manpower in order to reconfigure our P&O balance. -P&L. -Yes. To increase the liquidity of the parent company. So that they can list it on the stock market with that coefficient. With an IPO over 100. I hope you understand. No. We'll give you nine months' pay severance. Excuse me? Twelve. -Five months' pay. -Are you serious? -Nine. -Okay. -Three months' pay. -What? -Two. -God bless you. I signed as the manager. I'm guessing you heard? Yes. I'm sorry. Stop, please just leave me alone. Stop. What's wrong? I have to work. This morning we were fine. This morning was different. This morning we were talking about a mortgage, and moving in together. My friends from college talk about their kids, their houses. Hang on, I can go find work in Italy, it's good money. Come with me, it'll just be sunshine and good food. Yeah, let's go to Italy, because that's why I went to college. To move to Italy and wash dishes or be someone's caretaker, right? What will people say? What will people say? Enough. Just wait, the pond's full of fish. No, it's not. What? There's no fish here. If we wanted the fishing pond we'd have had to pay 80 lei per person. -So what the hell are we doing here? -We're having a nice, relaxing time. You guys said you wanted to go fishing, not to catch fish. I could kill him. I was gonna propose in the fall. I had it all planned out. Wedding venue, too. I'm gonna sell the boat on CraigsList. Come on, man. Don't you start, too. What can I do? I have to pay for my apartment. 800 lei a month. So what should I do then with six kids? Four with the same mother. Sell one on CraigsList. So what do we do, guys? I think I'm gonna go back to my cousin's place in Italy. Another restaurant, another factory, another construction job. It's much better over there. You? Well, I only have a high school diploma, I don't like working, and I'm aggressive. I'm thinking of becoming a cop. Government jobs are the best. Swing a baton to the left, a little pepper spray to the right, a boot to the throat, and they keep paying you. I envy you. Tell me about it. Either way, I was thinking of taking a break for as long as this severance pay holds me over. Dude, I have an idea. Let's invest. In what? In us. Dude! You're such an idiot, Horsey. I swear. Quit hitting me! You already bruised up both my arms! You sure he said to meet here? Of course he said here. By the lake parking lot! -So where is he? -How should I… -What the hell is that? -Are you crazy? This is the coolest car I've ever breathed next to. -You like it? -Yeah. -It's ours. -What do you mean it's ours? Perfect. We'll sell it, cross the border to Bulgaria, buy three used cars, bring them here, and… Horsey! Do you ever use that space between your ears? For what? Listen… Why is the license plate Italian? That's how I rented it. I'm telling you, these last few years, the nerves, the stress, working weekends, for what? -Yeah, for what? -For these guys to fire us? Guys, let's take our severance money and head to Bucharest. Bars, restaurants, whatever we want. That's a millionaire lifestyle. We're not millionaires. We're not millionaires, we'll just spend like we are. -The top comes down? -Take it easy. Then what'll we do next weekend? We'll figure it out. Spain, Italy, we'll see. Silvi would kill me. My mother had a saying. What was it? "Forget her." Are you out of your mind? We share the mortgage! -My dad had a saying, too. -Now what? I'm driving first. Hang on. Wait guys, take me with you. Is this for men, or? Yes, this whole section is the men's section. -Great. -What are you interested in? Something to make me look like a gentleman. Are you looking for something in particular? Yes, hi, I really like this. -Would you like to try it on? -Does it come in my size? Of course, size medium would be perfect. Thank you. Dan! -What have we done? -I don't know, what? We're all dressed the same! Yeah, man, so we can spot each other in the club. -Bro, are you dumb? -What's wrong? -Yeah, what is it? -It's like we're wearing a uniform. So? We wore a uniform at the factory. God. -Good evening. -Good evening. Hello, excuse me? What are you doing here? The arcade is next door. What was that? No, these respectable gentlemen and I are looking for some nice suits for a memorable weekend. I see. And what kinds of suits? Two piece, four piece? Single breasted, double breasted? Do you prefer a slim or relaxed fit? Yeah. Okay. Follow me. -Hey, check it out. -Yeah. -Jeez, it's Silvi. What do I say? -Tell her she made a mistake. What mistake? It's my number. When she said "I do", at your wedding. When she married you. Didn't you tell her you were going to Bucharest? I told her I was going to a career fair. Here, hand it over. -Be careful what you say. -Of course. Silvi, yeah, it's Eugen, yeah. No, Dorinel can't talk right now, he's at the table. Yeah, at a table at the job fair, yeah. He's had four interviews already, it's crazy. I hope you're ready! Yeah, get ready, you might be heading to Germany! I see him now, I can see him, he's shaking hands with the boss! Yeah, 2000. Not lei, euros! Yes, our stupid Dorinel, yeah. I can't believe it either! Neither can he, you know? Good afternoon. Hey, listen, I gotta go, but I'll bring him home in one piece, okay? -A little something on the house. -Thank you. What can I bring for you? Something grilled… Six sausages. And the lamb ones, too, and three pints of beer. Very well. -Pints of beer? -What? The bottles are more expensive. What, they didn't bring any for you? Wait, what is this? Sushi? That's obviously salami. -Are you actually that dumb? -Tomatoes, cheese. Look, grapes like the ones your mother grows. Small entryway. Short guys, too. -See, this is what I'm talking about! -I love it here! -Nice, you liking the capital? -It's amazing! -You like it, huh? -Tavi? -Hi. -Hi! Grey Goose, beautiful, elegant. -Yes. -What? Excellent. Why don't you come over here and sit with us? Yeah, sure, that's a great idea. Check this guy out, look at his watch. He's a sucker. Don't throw yourself at them or you'll seem desperate. -Yeah, you have to be aloof. -What do you mean? -Do a lap around the club. -Make her look for me, right? -Yes, and you're very important. -Yeah, go on, go. No, go! -How's it going? I'm Eugen. -Dan. -We've got something French over here. -Just that? -You're beautiful. -We have everything. What a beautiful lady. I did what you told me and she called me over to her table! He's stupid, but he's lucky. What's up? They call me Horsey. But my name's Dorin. -Dorinel? -Amanda. -What's your name? -Drunk Horse! God, look at the time! Eugen. Wake up, dude, it's late! We have to go! Yeah. Go. God, you're a mess. Well, thanks, but didn't you see yourself last night? It was dark, I couldn't see anything. God, she's gorgeous. Are we taking them with us? No way, they're from the country. Like hell I am. Get out, I'm not in the mood for you. -This one's aggressive, she's Moldovan. -Yeah, we can't take her anywhere. Dude, are you crazy? Wait, get off. -You'll regret it. -Yeah. Eugen? Come over here. Come here. He's fucked up, he said the blonde left. He's dumb, but he's functioning. Hello, Silvi? -Yeah, Dorinel is right here! -You're such an idiot! Four rounds. I tore her up. By the end she was crying. I'm still crying. Because of how annoying you are. Man, she's so dumb. She's just angry I ruined her. What do you mean? At Tic-tac-toe. Four nil. God, look at her! -Get off me, you're wet! -So what? It's supposed to be the other way around, dummy. You wanna play Tic-tac-toe? -Just a minute. -Checking out. The guys in the penthouse. My dear lady, would you tell me your name? It's on the bill. I hope this phone number here is yours. It's in lei, right? Could be worse. Eugen, come here a second. Eugen! -Dude, I told you we should use condoms. -What's wrong? Jesus, I'm so itchy! -No way, those girls were fine. -If I give something to Silvi… -What's that for? -In case it rains. Take it off. -What's this? -There's still the minibar charges. Can we pay with more than one card? What are you doing? -What? -You have to drive. I'm just as hangover as you two. Dude, last one in the car has to drive. I'm gonna kick your ass. Go! Can you believe this guy? Tavi? Tavi? Hey, do you usually sleep on your side or on your back? On my side and on my back. It doesn't matter anymore anyway. We're out of gas. What? Eugen! I fucked up, man. What? No, this is classic Horsey. I'll kill that guy. Fuck him and fuck his mother. Hey, no, not the car! Right, not the car. -Didn't you see it? -This car is a piece of shit, man! Dude, didn't you see the light? Right there on the dashboard? That red light? I saw it but I thought we'd come across a gas station soon. It's my first Bentley. I'll kill him. Do like five or six years in prison. -Eugen! -Maybe ten. Yeah? -Can we focus up a little bit? -Yes. I don't have any reception. Okay. We're somewhere between Rome and Verona. What? The car's from Italy, and the map's from Italy. -We're… -Where? At an impasse. Wait, dude, give him a second, he's all mixed up. -Horsey, buddy, come here. -Yeah. Concentrate, man. When we got to Pitesti, did you go straight or make a left? Is Pitesti the one with the mountains? What are you doing with your hand? Are you the prime minister? God, you're so dumb! What's wrong? I was saying hi! Wouldn't it have been better to ask him for gas? I wanted to, but he was on a bicycle. Or you could've asked him if there's a gas station nearby? Yeah. -Or where we are? -Nice! We could be anywhere! We could be near a city, or in the fucking gorge, or on the other side of the country! Look, you guys are the ones who tricked me into driving. Your whole life is a trick, you're 40 years old and you didn't get anything! -38. -38, that's what I said. -Who, me? -You're so dumb. -I am. -Guys, check your pockets. Come on. Inventory. Maybe we still have something. Careful, man! Come here. Watch out. Check this out. I'm listening. Don't tell anyone. They've been there over two hours. -And how do you know for sure it's them? -Who else could they be? That's them, man. The Italian investors. They're sneaky. They came here to scope the place out without us knowing. They're trying to find a reason to offer us a lower price for the factory, huh? -Call the mayor. -Already on it. Let me check out your manicure. So what? I cut my nails. -The other hand? -I cut them both. Give me your wedding ring. Why? So I can leave it at the gas station as collateral. Man, Silvi would kill me. But first, you'll have to make it out of here alive. -What's wrong with you? -Watch out, I can run. So run, then. Are you okay? -Horsey, get back here! -No! -Horsey, stand still! -It's Silvi's! -Take it off! -No! Horsey! -Get it out of there, asshole! -No. -Get it out or I'll take it out. -Or I'll take you out. It's Silvi's. Not that little thing. The smaller thing. -They're both Silvi's. -Take them both out. -No. -I'll do it. Jesus, I can't believe you stuck your hand in my pants! It's cold! Police! They actually came. What's with these guys? Your tie, Mr. Mayor. Your tie. Sirs, good day, welcome all of you. That's about as much Italian as I've got. …I'm the mayor of this community, of this wonderful town. That's about it with the English. Hey, don't we have a translator? We don't Mr. Mayor. Where would we get one? How are we supposed to understand these guys? You really are dumb. Gentlemen, excuse me. Do any of you speak any Romanian? Maybe a little? -Me. -You understand Romanian? Excellent, thank you very much. -Have you understood up till now? -No. -That I'm the mayor? -Yes. Great, that's it. I have come here to greet you and to let you know you're in the right place. It's a wonderful place with wonderful people. Well, it's in a valley, apparently. Not apparently, it is definitely in a valley, that's the geographical configuration. You know, we've got… our little town has many important accomplishments, at the local and national level. We have the two tallest telegraph poles in the country. -Both of them. -As I said. So, there are many… -Would you like to translate? -Yes! He said something about telegraph poles, tallest in the country, that he's the mayor of… Horsey, we know. Act like you're translating. -Just pretend. Say some words in Italian. -What should I say? Whatever comes to mind. Mascapone, fetucini, pomodorro mozzarella, montadini, prosciutto e funghi, mozzarella, e bella. Is the first part understood? -Yes. -Great. Great, well, moving right along then. I'd like to invite you to come with me into town, you can stay at the hotel. We'll show you the factory, since that's why you're here, and then we can head to city hall, we'll have some breadsticks, olives, you know. Here you go, we have some traditional bread and salt, and a little something to drink to give us some courage to climb those steps. And these two young ladies are very good at mathematics! -Bless you. -Bless you. And here, looks, the steps are made from river rocks from our own river. Look, let me show you where you'll be staying. Please. Whatever they need, at any hour. They're not just anyone, they're very important people. Spotless. Full service. -Thanking you! -Yes, well done, thank you. You see? Well then, let's let them settle in a bit. Accommodation with… and then we'll see what we'll see. Come on then, let's all leave them be, let's go. Listen to me, if this doesn't go flawlessly, when I run for reelection you'll be sticking up posters. Come on, hurry up. Cheers. What the hell? Why don't you pick on him? I did, earlier. -Yeah, but you didn't hit him. -What are you doing? Does it seem like a good time to be drinking? We'll wait for the car, and we're out of here. Yeah, man, but until the car gets here… Hey, Tavi. Relax. We pretend like we're staying here, so they don't suspect anything. I'm gonna go make some coffee. -Hey, me first! -No, Horsey, no. Excuse me, sir. We've just finished setting up your room. I've made sure that everything is impeccable, it's very clean. The code for the Wi-Fi is by the window. If you need anything else from me, I'm here to serve you. No, don't serve me. -What? -No, don't serve me. I wanted to tell you, when I spoke to Mr. Moratti, he told me he wouldn't be here for another two days. And… Yes, Mr. Moratti… He can't make it. He have an accident. -Yes. -A boating accident. Probably suicide. Terrible suicide. I'm so sorry to hear that. But I do hope things will still be the way we agreed upon with Mr. Moratti? -Yes. -Yes. Take a seat. This is… Sofia. Hello, Sofia! Ciao! She's going to make your lives much easier. For example: Sofia, close the blinds. Check it out. Sofia, play some music. Club music. And club lighting! You like it? Man, oh, man! How did we get here? What do you mean, how did we get here? We were on the side of the road, we ran out of gas, and those guys came and picked us up. You're such an idiot. Concentrate for a minute. We need to figure out what we're going to do. What we should do is have some more of this. Quit drinking so much, man, we have to drive soon! Just one quick one! Have you looked outside? The whole village is waiting for us. If they figure out that we're not who they think we are they'll kill us. And how do you plan on leaving without a car? -Who is it? -Police! -We're naked! -All of you? -In Italian! -All three of us! Yes? Your car, gentlemen. -Thank you. -I filled the tank. -Thank you. -Hang on. -I changed the oil, too. -Thank you. Wait. Would you like me to have it washed? No. Thank you so much. I'm gonna go see what the deal is with the car. I'll pull up around the back. Come downstairs in five minutes, and we'll blow this joint. -Oh, hello! -My shoelace! Come on, where are you guys? Get over here, what are you doing over there? Come on, they're here! Who said Italians aren't on time? Quickly. We're going to the factory. Gentlemen, look at this beauty. Built by the communists in '72, sold by us, for the most part, in '94. It's still like new. Just a little investment and it's taken care of. -What about the debts? -Shut up, man. -Please, would you translate? -A blue factory… -Come on then, let's go inside. -Let's go! As I was saying, all it really needs is some fresh paint, a few improvements to the left, and right and… -And the bathrooms! -And that's it! Come along then. Thank you. Come on. Let's get on with it, Gelu. -And bring the camera. -Yes, boss. Careful now, come on. Come here. What does this factory produce? Right now we make abutments. But we can also make rod ends, or just rods, or just ends, front bumpers, back bumpers, parts for Lamborghini, for Ferrari. Anti-roll rods for Sandero, we make? We can, yes, at the end of the day you make the decisions. It'll be your factory, you can make whatever you like. We're very hard workers, and there's plenty of us, thank God. Here we have, wait, wait just a minute, he's gone. Just a minute. What are these guys doing? Why did you leave them? Eugen. Come on, man. It's not funny anymore. If we don't leave now, that's it. Yeah, let's go! You really wanna leave now, when I get to be an investor? When are we going to have another chance like this? Yeah, man! Didn't you say we were gonna live large the whole weekend? We still have two days. -Take it like another city break. -Exactly! -Dude, Eugen. -Eugen. Don't "Eugen" me. That's it. Excuse us. Come on, man, faster, let's go. They're… they're timid, I mean, they didn't want to bother you. Come on! Come on, everybody. I brought them over so you could see how hardworking the people of Palticeni are. If you don't mind, they'd like to say a few words. -Go ahead. -We're very glad you've come here. Louder. Finally, we can send our children to school, too. You won't regret choosing Palticeni. Everyone here is very dedicated to their work. Well done. Lots of us have also worked around abroad, but it's better here, at home. -It's best here. -Okay, that's enough. They want to work here, in their home, do you understand? What do you think? What do you say? Very good. At seven we hope you start working. That's all we needed. Hope. That's what we need. Hang on. So, now let's head to city hall because they're waiting for us. -Who is? -Everyone! He's learning Romanian! He said "who is"! He said "dinner", not "who is". He's hungry. We have it all set up over there, anything you need. -Let's go. -Let's go then. Clap! Film them when they got out of the car. Go a little more that way. Okay, one more time, sir, once more, please. -We don't have any time. -Press. No, it's just that the deputy is waiting, and the whole council, and… -And the press. -Yes, and the press, yes. After this meeting we'll have a conference, too. -What conference? -A press conference. Yes, of course, we'll have a press conference, we'll have one at the beginning and one at the end. No problem. Speaking of, how should I introduce you to the press? -A toilet? -He's asking for the restroom, Mr. Mayor. Yes, I got that. You think I didn't get that? Go ahead and take them to the bathroom if you're so interested now. Come on then, go ahead, let's go. Come. -After you. -Thank you. -Gelu. -Gelu, let's go. You know what, guys? I like being an Italian investor. Are you kidding me? They're asking for our names. This is identity theft. Yeah, man. Let's make a run for it. We'll jump out the window, get to the hotel, we'll be out of town by the time they realize we're gone. -Let's go. -Boys, calm down. Listen… If the people don't exist, and we don't sign anything, how is it identity theft? Name one of the Italian soccer player on Mamore. Raducioiu. He's Romanian. Gianluigi Buffon. What the hell? He's Italian! He's too well known. -Another. -Baloteli. I like that. I'm Giancarlo Baloteli. I'm from a family of millionaires in Milan who work in… they have a high end restaurant empire. It's perfect for me, I'm killing it with the Italian. Where'd you learn Italian? Remember? I was a big fan of Corado Catani when I was younger. And where'd you learn Romanian? Well, I have some Romanian employees, a few waiters who taught me a little bit. Either way, the trick is, whenever you speak, just speak broken Romanian. -Like Raducioiu. -Exactly. And give them lots of "how do you say?" How do you say? Okay, fine, man. But when we're done playing Italians, we're out of here. Yeah, dude! Okay, so I'll be… Doctor Luigi Testarosa. How did you come up with that? Well, Luigi is Mario's brother in the video game, and Testarosa is a Ferrari model. -And since when are you a doctor? -Look, I liked school. And where did you learn Romanian? I have 400 employees. -Romanian? -All of them. -And what'll my name be? -I'm sure I'll think of something. Thanks. Let's go. Please, come. Right there. Please, go ahead. Thank you to all of you for such a warm reception. We are very pleased to have among us the delegation of Italian investors who have promised our town its most important economic goal, to get Paltimpex back on its feet. Allow me to introduce the gentlemen of this delegation. Please give a round of applause… to Mr. Giancarlo… Doctor Giancarlo Baloteli. Doctor Giancarlo Baloteli. A round of applause. Doctor Professor Luigi Testarovza. Testaroza? -Testarosa. -Testarosa. -And Mr. Alberto Mocirla. -Mocirla. Mocirla. Oh, really? Incredible! He's Alberto Mocirla. So, I've just found out that Alberto Mocirla is half Romanian! His father is from Moldova. So Mocirla from Moldova! Well, when we came across each other, I was busy lobbying for the local economy, which I am always doing. At that moment, I told them that they've found what they're looking for. Applause! Well done, Mr. Mayor! -Bravo! -Let's go. Welcome! To eat. Please, go ahead. -Please. -Please. I don't like AS Roma, I'm a fan of CS Craiova. To a perfect collaboration. It was on the pond, big pond! I throw the fishing rod in the pond, I pull, maybe stuck in mud, in reeds, I pull harder, big sea bass! Preparations have begun for your dinner. I sent someone into the city earlier to pick up some sushi, seafood, oysters. Great. And I reserved the club for tonight. -Wasn't it shut down by inspectors? -Yeah, but they opened it back up. -Who did? -The inspectors. Good for them. Great, so we've got the club. Drinks? -Got them. -Women? -Those, too. -Good, it's sorted. Mr. Mayor, if I may, these men are Italian. So what? They've seen the most beautiful women in the world. Monica Beluci, Madalina Ghenea. Come on! They'll forget about their women once they see ours. Our women are more coy, more creamy, more, you know, they're more like, they're natural, you know? I'm not worried about it. -Do you understand? -Excuse me, problem, we go home. -Bye. -Bye. What are you doing? Aren't you done? -Mr. Baloteli? -Hello, Miss. Madalina Gavrila from TVP. -Hello. -Palticeani TV. I'd love to chat with you a bit if I could. I cannot. Please, I just have one question. Like we say in Italy, "bye, gorgeous". Like I said, I just have one question. Seven inches, Miss. Minimum seven. Okay, what are the chances you'll grant me an exclusive interview? About acquiring Paltimplex? One at halftime, X at the end. Barcelona with Atletico, away team. Big, very big! Perfect. But… what are the chances, you and me, go my hotel, to my room, drink wine, Jacuzzi, us two? Got it. Small. Very small. But I have a chance, no? Mr. Mayor, again, I don't mean to contradict you, but this thing with the drinks and the women, it's played out. So what do you propose? Let's make a pool. A swimming pool? Let's pool funds, Mr. Mayor. Get some money together. A pool. Are you out of your mind? The city can't pay for that! The anti-corruption committee is breathing down my neck. Mr. Mayor, I don't want to do anything illegal either, or for it to come from the city budget. -So where would it come from? -The community. What do you want me to do go door to door asking people for money? -Not all of the people, Sir. -Then who? Just our business people. There aren't many of them, but they're there. What's in their best interest? For the Italians to stay. Why? More jobs. And if there are more workplaces, people will have more money. And if people have more money, they'll buy from our business people. It's easy. It's like a machine. You know, Samuila, you're not so dumb. You're really not as dumb as everyone here says. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. Listen. Go, talk to people, see how much you can come up with, and if it ends up being more money than we need… The important thing is that everyone is happy. I didn't see and hear anything. -Here's great. -Yes, go ahead. Here. Just a second, I don't want to interrupt you, but I'd like to get a picture of us together. Sure, if you could move just a bit more this way. That's perfect. That's much better, thank you. Gelu, come behind me. -So you can get them all in frame, yeah? -Got it, boss. What will you do? Are you going to take over the factory or not? Yes, certainly there are… problem with location, but… no rush. Pardon me for asking, but how do you learn to speak Romanian? Romanian language is very beautiful, the whole world… How do you say? -Everyone learns Romanian. -Wonderful. I understand. Is there a chance you'll choose a factory from another part of the country? -Or maybe even in Bulgaria? -Why would they choose Bulgaria? Please, sir. Just a second. The whole factory, we will put curtains with remote control! -Mr. Mayor. -Yes? How do you plan on convincing them to choose Palticeni over Bulgaria? Why would they choose Bulgaria? Why should they choose Bulgaria, Miss? What do the Bulgarians have that Palticeni doesn't have? Tell me? I really don't understand, and if you keep insisting, I mean, you are insisting. Look, I'll tell you the first thing that comes to mind. For example, they eat their salad before their soup. -Is that normal? -I see. I see, well, in the event of the takeover, can you reassure the people that you won't do any kind of downsizing? Senorita, the word "downsizing" do not exist in Italy. -Do not exist! -Well then, layoffs? Not a thing. Just one more question, if I may. Do you know…? Waiting. Hello. Please, I just have one more question. Madalina? Our guests are tired. Madalina. I understand, thanks, I'm doing my job. Please, Madalina, please. Gelu, shut that thing off please, I'm begging you, Gelu. -Turn off the camera. -I understand. -We love the press, but… -Enough, let him go! -Thank you very much. -What the hell? Yes. Hey, that's it, man. We've had our fun. Let's call it. Tavi's right. After all that food, and all this swimming, we should go lie down a while. Horsey, we're calling it and heading home, to Silvi, come on! I love Silvi! -Tavi, relax, man. -What do you mean "relax"? I'll relax when the cops come and arrest us for fraud. That's when I'll relax. Let's go! They have nothing to arrest us for. What fraud? We haven't signed anything. We've followed the rules. Think of it as charity. I'd love to spend my life as a charity case. You guys, do what you want, I'm gonna do one more cannonball. -One cannonball and we're out. -Yeah. -No, don't answer it. -Let's just see who it is. Don't answer. He's done his cannonball, it's time to go. -Hang on, maybe it's a lady. -What lady could it be? Get out of there, Horsey, come on, let's go. Wait let's see who it is. -Let's not. Come on. -Nothing's gonna happen if… It's this idiot. Yes? Hello? No, yes. No, yes. Underwear. Who was it? You'll never believe it. The mayor's invited us over to his place. -We're not going anywhere. -One more night. No more mayor, let's go, let's get out of here. Just a second. How? The police are right outside waiting for us. I couldn't find the… that. Turn off the light… Gentlemen, everything is exactly according to our agreement. What agreement? Well, what I spoke about to Mr. Moratti. I spoke with the mayor, too. We'll all make out as winners. We don't have to let go of 380 people. Instead we'll hire 400 people from Paltaceni. Great. Everything's perfect. -And you? -Yes. -Sure. -Yeah? Yes. Then it's perfect. That's all I wanted to… Come on, don't keep our guys out in the cold! -Good evening. -Good evening. Welcome. I just have to finish grilling the octopus and I'll be right there. Please, go on ahead. Take them inside. -Thanks. -Thank you, go ahead. -Good evening, welcome. -Good evening. Don't worry, they can pretty much understand Romanian. Yeah? Gentlemen, this is Adela, the mayor's daughter, and my future wife. -Let's go inside. -Please, head inside. I'm going to take the car back to the hotel, we've got a lot going on tonight. Mr. Mayor! I spoke to them, I sorted it out. The deal's as good as signed. I can't deal with that. Do you know how to cook octopus? -No. -I'm going for rare, just a little bloody. Do they even have blood? What good are you? Get out of here, leave me alone. Why can't it just be pork? Please, go ahead. Excuse me. Where are you? They're here. There's no need to take your shoes off! -Thank you. -No, please, sit. Thank you. -Yes, there's fine, wherever you'd like. -Here? -Yeah, there's great. -Yes. -Thank you. -Thank you. They're very fresh! We have someone who brings it in from Bucharest. -Crawfish! -Good evening! -Hello! -My father's wife. -Welcome! -Good evening. Is it so hard to tell them I'm your mother? -Good evening. -Good evening. -Hello. -Welcome. Good evening. My house is… my house! -Beautiful house! -Thank you. Thank you. Beautiful house, beautiful lady! Please, help yourselves, won't you? We've got some sushi. -No. -It's fantastic. Please, have some. -They just got here. -Shut up, Adela. -The mussels! You'll lick your fingers. -Don't touch it like that. -Mind your business. And… -For me, no. -It's very good. Please, I insist. -No, thank you. -I insist, it'd be a pity! It's good! -It's a lot! That's not a problem here! The octopus will be right out! Welcome, go on, please, you must, you haven't tried everything yet? I'm full! -There's no way! -Thank you, no. And I know why! You haven't had anytuica! You must take a shot of our plum brandy, it's tradition! -If it's tradition… -That's it. We've had it since we got married eight years ago. It was a gift from Ion Dolanescu's old chauffeur. How do you say? -Ion Dolanescu. -Right. I couldn't think of it. Cheers! -Hello. -Cheers! -Welcome everyone! -Cheers! And now we serve the whisky. Quit looking at me like that, go on and pour the whisky. -Shall I pour it for them or for you? -You can pour it for them and for me. Yes, honey, grab the whisky. Pour some for me, some for them, come on… Keep your voice down, they're watching. Okay, sweetie, let them watch if they want, they can't understand anything. -We understand a little. -A little whisky? We'll bring out someburdufcheese. That's enough. It's like Romanian parmesan! -Parmesan! -It's very good. -Parmesan. -Wait! Don't eat it! I forgot the onions. I forgot the onions! How silly of me! Forgetting the onions, God forbid. Excuse me. Quit harping on the onions! These are refined people. So what if they're refined? Italians don't eat onions? Did you see the blond one? By the looks of him, he had onions this morning. I'm asking you nicely, please don't bring out any onions, okay? Let's throw it under the table, so they think we ate it. Not under the table, they'll see it! We should put it in our pockets. In our pockets? Do you want to be chased by every dog in the village? -What, do dogs eat octopus? -Why wouldn't they? -Under the table is best. -Dude, are you crazy? -Under the table. -Eugen, are you crazy? Stop it! -What the hell is this? -That's a… -A cucumber from Chernobyl? What is it? -Toss it under the table! -Would you like a tour of the house? -Yes. -Oh, sorry, not you. Just him. -Yes. Yes, of course, yes. Excuse me! No problem! Welcome. Thank you. -Cheers. -Cheers. I get the impression you don't like Ginuta. We argue a lot. But I'm glad my dad isn't alone anymore. Yes, I think you love very much your father. Yeah. If it weren't for him I'd have left Palticeni a long time ago. Thank you. -Cancer? -No. -Taurus? -No. -Leo? -Yes. I knew it straight away! Darling? Don't you want to show them the house? And the yard, and the pool? Oh, yes. Of course! I decorated it myself. I'm really intoFung Shei, and, please, come with me. -Your wife… -Yes, my wife, she's an artist, she's… -Cheers. Cheers to us all. -To all of us. Excuse me. I thought Italians were born with rhythm. Yes, well, if they saw how I make pasta, they'd take away my citizenship. -This is my favorite song. -Really? -Yeah. -Oh, it's a good one. Do you know it? Was it big in Italy, too? No, I know it from my employees at the factory. What a big bed! -What's that? What are you doing? -A call from Italy. Yes. -Okay, I'm going to the bathroom. -I have to take it. Hello? Silvi? How are you, honey? No, it's very rough out here, at this job fair. Come on, 2,000 euros? They were just blowing smoke. Plus Germany is so cold in winter. Yeah, I have to go, they're closing the convention center and I don't want to get locked in! Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. Okay, love you, bye. You're married. My brother, look me in the eyes. How big is the chance you'll take the factory? Big. Very big. -Let me kiss you. -Huge chance. But the workers there, they have to be organized, and while they're at work, they can't slack off. They gotta work, you know? -I mean, do you understand me? -Every word. It's not so hard, Italian language! I mean, "slacking off," and… It was… it was an aunt! She lives in Parmesan. Oh, yes. It's very hot in Parmesan, and the oranges go bad, and she's old and doesn't have anyone to help her pick them. Yeah. But don't you have someone? Yes, he's downstairs. Downstairs, then let's head down, so he won't worry. Fine. Let's go then, make sure he's not worried. Wait, what? How? Ma'am! And you're just gonna leave? What do you mean? I mean, you came out of nowhere, no one knows you, and you're going to touch me softly like that and then just leave? Or not? I know you have to go. I just wanted to know if you were sorry you did. Samuila! Hey! I sent them over to the club. Keep an eye out. Everything has to be perfect, if it's not I swear to God I will chew you up and spit you out. This is the last hurdle, Samuila. We get this over with and we can put a cork in it. This, and it's over. Are we understood? Good, and Samuila, the girls, women, we have to… we have to have, I don't know, three or four, at least. Ladies, this is Doctor Professor… Baloteli. Exactly. He is very influential in Italy. So… Here… No, excuse me. Wouldn't you rather dance? I mean, you didn't come here to sit around, right? Just a second… Yes, from the factory. -Hey, Doctor! -Hey. -You promised me an interview. -Yes. -Are you too busy? -No. Let's go. Excuse me. Yes. Get out of here! -Cheers. -Cheers! Don't you want to go outside and grab a little fresh air? No, I am clean, I shower in the hotel. No, I was asking if you want to go outside for a bit, just the two of us. No understand, but I was thinking, if you want, we could go outside for a bit, just the two of us. Drunk! No you, me. -Any other questions? -I do have one question. -Please. -Is there a Mrs. Baloteli? SignioraBaloteli, one second. DO YOU WANT TO BE MRS. BALOTELI? Sir, excuse me. -What do you want? -What do you want. -I'm with a lady. -A lady, yes. -This guy, he's stupid. -Stupid. What do you want? What's up? -Mr. Saboteli. -Baloteli. Sorry. Here. Two hundred thousand euros. To secure my spot as manager. General manager. Attention, do you copy? Chief agent Balacescu, report. I found something strange. The Bentley the Italians were driving was reported stolen. Hang on, I'll put it in my bag, so you don't lose it. Come on, Tavi, pick up. Take it easy, or you'll really get me going. What's that vibration? -The cold. -It's your phone. -Forget it. -Will we see each other again? Yes, I come often for factory. -Will you remember me? -Never. I'll never forget you. Fall down already! I thought maybe Romanian custom! Seriously, get on the ground! -What are you doing? -Catch me! -What do you mean, "catch me"? -It is game! No games, come here! -We can't do this. -Why not? You're only here for one night. Then it'll be a night you'll never forget. -That's big talk. -I don't think it is. Look, when you're the mayor's daughter, everyone wants something from you. Like Samuila? Samuila wants more of my dad's money. And anyway, I think he likes men. -Let's run away. -Where? I don't know, anywhere in the world. Azuga, Sinaia, Bali! -You're sweet. But I can't. -So can I come to your place? Is it just me or do you speak Romanian perfectly well? What? No, Romanian drink, Romanian language! -Must've been me. -Yes. That idiot locked the door! Wait, no. I locked the door. I'm the idiot. Let's just call. No, wait. You'll wake him. Leave me here, go back to your girls over at the club, they're all waiting for you. Go! Hey! -What? -Where are you going? -To the girls. -No, come here. You're so cute, you're… I haven't felt like this in a long time, you've been messing with my head all night. Can I mess with it one more time? -Yeah, go on. -Okay. Do it! Mess with my head! Are you doing it? Are you doing it? Boo! Or what do you guys say in Italy? How… how you made it in here? I have my sources. -I'm a journalist, remember? -How could I forget? Eugen! Eugen! Let's go, the cops are here! We have to run! The Doctor is very drunk! Let's go, man, let's go! They're looking for us at the front desk! -No police, no. -Wait just a minute, what's going on here? It's nothing. Let's go already! Madalina, you are gorgeous, I swear on my mother. -God forbid. -Let's go! Go. Be careful! Adela, what surprise! What are you doing here? -I came to give you your phone. -Thank you. -What are you doing? Are you leaving? -No, my friend is sick. Six beer make vision unclear! -Are you sure you're not lying to me? -No. You weren't trying to run away right after…? -What? No, I could never. -Tavi? Tavi! Come on, man, I'm sick of this town full of peasants. I want to go home to Silvi! -Dude… -Adela? Like mother like daughter. You know, I didn't have sex with your mom, she's fine, I sent her home. -Let's go home. -I love Silvi. I get it. This is all some kind of game or joke to you, right? No. Or is Tavi an Italian name I didn't know about? Adela, no. Adela, let me just explain. No, Adela! Do you want to go to jail? Tavi? Tavi! Let's go! Listen. What's that sound? Silence. The calm before the storm. And with elections coming up. I have to resign. Beautiful. It's a beautiful area. I like it. Here, we'll make a lot of money, we will technologize everything, we fire people. Beautiful, you did a great work. Congratulations. -Thank you, Mr. Moratti. -You're welcome. -Did they really leave? -They left, yeah. They didn't leave. Hang on a second. They didn't leave. They disappeared. They drank, they got drunk, they got in the car, drunk, and went sightseeing, you know? And at a sharp turn they… crashed into the river. Right? And we'll make… we'll make a big cross, make a little chapel or… we'll make a basilica for them, like in Italy. We'll put down flowers, really nice, we'll sing "Ave Maria". I have to resign. Whose car is that over there? -I can't believe it. -What? Those clowns told me Mr. Moratti had killed himself. He's right there. Not a scratch on him. These are the real investors. They said they were coming today, and they did. I swear, Mr. Mayor, that's them. -Okay, man, let's go. You're sure? -Yes, I swear. Alright, man, everyone downstairs. Are you going down there like that, in your pajamas? Who said I'm going in pajamas, huh? Don't I have a jacket around here? -I don't, do I? -I'd give you mine if I had one. -Take off your pants. -What now, are you punishing me? And your shirt, and your tie. What are you still doing here? -I'm staying. -Why? -I'm staying. -Why? I'm done taking initiative! That's it! There we go, look how good I look. We'll say it's a fancy new look. Why are you in your underwear? What am I supposed to put on? Well, take these! Put this on. What do you mean take these? Well what's wrong with them? They're pleated! Come on, get dressed. Alright, this is fine. Come on, hurry up. -Okay. -That's it. Look, we'll say it's the Mayoral suit. Yeah, right… Mayoral suit… -Okay ready, are you ready? -Ready. Good. One big cross, and God help us. Not with your left! Oh, it's in the mirror. Alright then, let's go. -What are you doing there? -Nothing. -Hang on. -What's with all this cash? Come on, man, that's my rainy day fund. Eugen, where'd you get all this money? Okay, man, it was a going away present from Paltaceni. Happy? I'm really not in the mood for jokes right now. It's not a joke. Samuila gave it to me to convince us to buy the factory. -And you took it? -Yeah. Who knows where that money came from? It's bribe money, man. It's black money. It's cold hard cash, given under the table, to more cunning thieves. Okay. That's where we're at now? We're thieves? Therefore, Mr. Volovat, what we're saying is we need to adjust our manpower in order to reconfigure our P&L balance. To increase the liquidity of the parent company, right? So that, if the company goes public, they can list it on the stock market with an IPO over 100. So that, if the company goes public, they can list it on the stock market with an IPO over 100. Sure, very nice. So to sum it up? They're happy to buy the factory. But let's not forget that means firing 380 people, Mr. Mayor. Let's take this into consideration, please. Gentlemen, these people have families, kids, I mean, if you're going to let them all go, what are you actually investing in? Old metal? The Mayor is saying that the people have families, if they are fired, we invest in metal? We have another offer to start new businesses south of the Danube, in the Ruse area. If you will sign the letter, we will think that is a step toward the future. What did he say about…? No, "futuro" means "future." -Oh, yeah? -Of course. It sounds like something very different here. They're saying that they have a counter offer. South of the Danube. At Ruse. -Where? -At the Bulgarians. Why is everyone always going on about Bulgarians? Let's go to the Bulgarians! Do these men know they eat their salad before their soup? Go on, ask them! Mr. Mayor, how am I supposed to ask him if he knows that Bulgarians eat salad before soup? They eat their salad before their soup! No need to translate anymore. That's it. Forget the Bulgarians, at the end of the day, who needs them? Mother of God, I've never seen so much money in my life! What do we do with it? Listen, because I was raised right, I say we split it three ways, like brothers. I also think we should split it three ways like brothers. Those people were nothing but kind to us, right? Yeah. -And they put their hope in us? -Yeah. -And we're gonna take their money? -Yeah. Listen, man, isn't that what investors do? Yeah. But we're not investors! Speaking of which, I think I saw the real investors. I woke up this morning to three guys, I think they were Italian, asking me where city hall was. -Great, it worked out. -What? Yeah, man. I heard them say something about downsizing, I didn't really understand. And you're just telling us now? When else? What do you want from me? To tell you if someone wakes me up? Or someone puts me to bed? You sound like Silvi. Now I'm annoyed. -I have an idea. -Dude, no. No! Listen, if you don't want to split it, I'm taking it. -It's my money. -And mine! It was. -Tavi, man! -Tavi, stop! -Tavi! -Stop! -Give us the money, Tavi! -Tavi! -Tavi! -Tavi! -Hey, open! -Tavi! -As we were saying… -Yes. If we're in agreement, go ahead and sign this letter of intent. We'll consider it a preamble. -Hey, man, quit it! -Don't sign it. I'm not signing it, I'm just building a little tension. Will you keep 300 employees? -Will we keep 300 employees? -It's not possible. -What did he say? -No, he can't do that. -250. -No. 200. -200. -No. -What did he say? -Still no. 34. 34? Okay. What did he say? Okay. Excellent negotiating, Mr. Mayor. 300 to 34 is a big difference. -Stop it. -Let's think about this a minute. I told you, look 34 out of 300, 300 minus 34 is 160… Look, at least, they're not going to the Bulgarians! Let's read it. -Just think about it a minute. Please. -Leave me alone. Hello! He says that we're here to make a counter-offer for the acquisition of your factory. The have a counter-offer. What counter-offer? What is this? Is he mad at me? No. Yes! Of course he's upset. What kind of circus is this? What kind of game are we playing here? What counter-offer? Is there an auction? -Why don't we know about this? -Wait! Don't pick a fight with us, we didn't know anything about this either! They just showed up, willy-nilly, we didn't know! Take it easy. Gentlemen, we really didn't know about this, but as far as I can tell it's a good thing, it's a positive. This means our factory is in demand. I mean, it is. That's the market. I don't see anything wrong in bringing them into the discussion. -With whom do I have the pleasure? -Luigi… son. Lord Luiginson. Polovat. And you, sir? My name is Eugen. I'm this gentleman's lawyer. -Just Eugen? -Just a second. We represent Baloteli LTD. -Iorgu. Iorgu Eugen. -Mr. Iorgu… You look familiar, have I seen you on television before? -It's possible. -Please. -Please, have a seat. -Thank you. No way, this can't be happening. What are they doing here? Mr. Mayor, you can't give these jokers a seat at the table. You know what's going on! Quit yelling like that, you'll wake him up. Wake up, man. Do we have something against the English? Prince Charles is our neighbor up on the hill, he's a squats over in Viscri. We've got nothing against the English, nor the Italians. Gentlemen. How you say it? My client says that due to Brexit, he would like to relocate a factory here. And either way, the tomatoes from this region are incomparable. He's saying something about Brexit and tomatoes. What tomatoes? -A signing bonus. -Just a moment, sir, let's have a look. These gentlemen understand a signing bonus, just like in soccer… Fiorentina, Juventus. Leave that there. Thank you. My client is prepared to offer a three year collective work agreement for absolutely everyone. That's very good, Mr. Mayor, it's very good. They want to sign a three year collective work agreement for everyone. That's their business, isn't it? So? Mr. Mayor, sir, in this kind of market, it's very common, of course, for counter offers to appear. And for this reason they'd like to offer a counter-offer to the counter-offer. Collective work agreements for all employees. -Meaning for all 380 of them? -Yes. -Four years? -Four. -So you'd do all 380 for four years? -All of them for four years. -All 380. -Shut up already. All 380 for four years? All of them for four. Gentlemen? Five years? Can you offer five years? Winners! You've won. Well done. -Well done. -Thank you. Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. WORK IN PROGRESS DO NOT STAY IN THIS PLACE People of Paltaceni, please, hear me out! I have something to ask of you. Can someone bring Adela over here? Or call her and tell her to come to the square? Thank you. Hi, Adela? Hey, it's Madalina. Could you come to the town square, please? It's urgent. Great. You did something extraordinary. Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that I lied to you. Yeah. Well, that's it. Do you think we could start over? Like, okay, I'm Eugen, and I'd love to take you out for some juice. Do I have a shot? One at halftime, X at the end. Barca beats as the away team. I have to go live. What are you doing? Get down before you fall! I know you hate me. Louder! I know you hate me. I lied to you. I'm not an Italian millionaire. I'm an unemployed Romanian. I don't have a car. I have a scooter that I'm scared of riding. Actually, I'm scared of a lot of things. I'm scared of what people say about me. I'm scared of what my parents think. I'm scared of heights. I'm afraid of making a fool of myself. I know that whatever I say now doesn't change the fact that I messed up so badly. But, before we were born, I asked you to choose the color of my eyes. But our souls… were too young and… and they had never hit the ground. All I had seen until then was the sky. So you chose… blue for me. Thoughts thrown into the wind Like letters in bottles Taken by the waves Beaten by time and broken-hearted I'm still waiting to reach the shore You waited for me to tell you how I feel But there's no time in this eternity So I chose to love you Like a simple mortal I thought that I would die of thirst Waiting for my soul mate But we promised each other That we would see each other again Long ago, before we were born Maybe The sunset is just the sunrise Seen from behind Seen from behind Maybe In another life we'll find each other again And we'll learn to be happy Watching two sunrises a day
