Hi, Daddy! Hi, papi! Lucas, you want some? Ah... - Mm, you want a bite? - Look. Oh, my gosh, look how... That kid! Where is he? Lucas, ven aquí, papi. Ah! Let's play, Daddy. - You're gonna break my stuff! - Get ou... What's up! Andy fucking Roy right here. I'm here with the Reno fucking Rats! Reno Rats, motherfucker! - Hey, Lucas! - Daddy's home! - Reno Rats! - Yeah! Yeah! Who started this crew? Who got the crew together? Lucas! We're not gonna be in Reno long now. Let's get out of here, Lucas! Shit, hold on for fucking dear life! Oh, shit. Yo, hey, Lucas, you okay, man? - Hey. - That's it, dude. That's it. - Yeah, Lucas... - Dude... - One more. - Call it a day. Lucas, we can just come back another day. Let's call it, man. I'm not leaving till I get this. You've got one more, and we're out of here. Hey, Lucas. Lucas. For real. Dude, yo, he's done today. Hey, put the camera down and help us. - Hold on. - Lucas? - You all right, bro? - Lucas. Lucas! Do you want some water or tea or some oatmeal? No, I'm good, thank you. You sure you don't want some oatmeal? What's up, Mom? You're acting weird. Your dad passed yesterday. - Is that it? Can I go now? - Don't do that, Lucas. You want me to be more sad or less sad? I feel like the second somebody dies, everybody acts like they were some saint or something. You never had anything good to say about him growing up. Like, if we even talked about him. You know, when you were a kid, we explained things to you in kid terms, but it's not that black and white. There was so much more to the story than you know. Okay. How'd he die? Lung cancer. Nice. Your Uncle Tommy went to the estate lawyer. And, um, your dad left everything to you. Oh, my God, the fucking deadbeat dude. I don't want any of his stuff. - Can you please just ask Uncle Tommy to take care of it? - No. All of the apartments are in your name. What apartments? Ugh, yeah, yeah, hold on. Hey, uh, I'm sorry to knock so loud, Lucas, but I didn't know if you were in or not. Yeah, I'm... I'm in. Sleeping. - Oh, yeah, I'm sorry... I'm sorry to wake you. - Nah. But I just thought that we would get the day started. Um... Do you remember me at all, kid? No, sorry. Okay, I met you a few times when you would come to visit your father when you were little. I guess you were too young. Yeah. You still got the same baby face. Yeah. Well, okay. You know, enough reminiscing. I just thought that, you know, I would take you out, we'd make the rounds and introduce you to all the tenants. - Yeah. - I'm the groundskeeper slash superintendent. Well, I kind of work better alone, so... - You work... - Listen, I appreciate this whole "father figure, help me out" thing, but I'm good, thanks. - You're good? - Yeah. Okay. You know what? I'll be around if you need me. - See ya, kid. - Oh, um, hey, what's the deal with me selling the place? - In terms of what? - Selling the place. I want to sell the place. Well... first, you have to go through all your father's stuff. Make sense of it all. Is there like a 30-day notice I gotta give everyone? All the tenants? So they can go away? Yeah, your pops, he said you would be like this. Haven't seen him in ten years. Did he tell you that? - I'll see you around, Baby Face. - Hey, don't call me that. That's... that's not my nickname. See you around, Baby Face. Yo, what up? - What up, bro? - Um, is, uh, Kieffer here? Yeah, if you're looking for Guala Boy to sign something for you, it's not gonna be a good day. Yo, what the fuck? Lucas! Damn! - It's so fucking good to see you. - What's up, big boy? Yeah, eh, eh, Cosmo says you live here now. Ah, no, I don't. I mean, for now I guess I do, but... He says you're rich now, bro. Inherited a mansion from your dad, gonna set up some skate park where that pool used to be. Bro, don't listen to anything Cosmo ever says in his life. Four tres, blood. Fuck Cosmo. Eh, I want you to see something. My first pro deck. - Ooh... - Eh, what you think? That's awesome. They let your boy do the graphics and everything on that. Yeah, I can tell. Eh, you want one? They gave me a bunch. Yo, yo, yo. You're the guy from Reno Rats. Reno Rats! I knew I recognized him. - Hey, Lucas! Varela! - Varela! Yo! Look, Reno Rats Two, like, we still have that on the VHS, - Put that on the VCR. - It's in the back. - Eh, eh, that tape is dirty, bro, for real. - You're amazing. - Eh, that was the best tape ever. - That one was fucked up. Damn, dude, I barely recognized you. What do you do? You still skate? Nah, I don't really do any of that shit anymore. Mm, fuck! Honestly didn't take you to be a skater. You seem more like a rollerblader to me. Well, I'm not either. Then what's that? Don't worry about it. Sorry, I didn't mean to... I was just... I was just being a dick. Teach me a trick. Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me, dawg. You don't think I can skate 'cause I'm a girl? - Is that what it is? - No. I just don't think you can skate period. Come on, just teach me. Come on. Oh, boy, all right. - I knew you would. - Get on. Okay, ready? Pull me. - Come on, pull me. - No. Pull me! Faster. Come on, pull me, bitch! Come on. Come on! Faster! Faster! Okay, now let go, let go. I'm doing it! Uh, just keep it... Keep it elevated. I broke my wrist a bunch of times. - You just gotta, like... - Can we please talk about something else? Like, anything else. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sorry. - Thank you. So, uh, what do you do for work? I, um... I sell vintage. - Sell vintage? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, like, I buy vintage clothes and then I sell them. Unless I really like them. Then I keep 'em for myself. So you basically shop for yourself for a living, as a job? Kind of, I guess. That's cool. That's awesome. You know, you don't have to stay here. You can... you can leave. I know. Oh! What the fuck? God damn it! Ah, fuck! Fuck, fuck me, Jesus! Shit. Help! Hey! You have no experience with plumbing, but you thought you would just go ahead and twist some valves? All right, go ahead. Twist the new valve, open it up. All right, now try the water. There you go! See? You really do work better alone. Pretty much. Ah, it's an old building. Your father renovated it. It still has its quirks. Do you know that James Dean lived up on the third floor? For real? No, I'm just fucking with ya. Fuck you. It's okay to ask for help... sometimes. - Yo, what the fuck? - Whoa, Jesus, I thought there was nobody here. - Hey, man, hey. - Hey! Hey! Hey, wait! Whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey, Lucas, it's me. - Who the fuck are you? - It's me. It's me. Who? You don't remember me? - Uncle Tommy? - Yes! I thought you were gonna kill me with that thing, man. - You should knock next time. - I... I just... It's me. It's a nice old building, you know. I mean, no rent control. - Yo, come in. - Hey, hey! Hey, there he is! How are ya? - How are ya? - Captain. So... What's new, Tom? A lot. A whole lot of shaking going on. Sammy Stein, Luke. This is the best of the best of property law. Ooh. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? Yeah, old Sammy here, he got me out of a jam or two back in the day. - Yeah? - Old IRS wanted to take everything from me. The shirt off my back. - In fact, every shirt. - Fuck the IRS. He always says that. So, I just got off the phone with the legal team at Innovation Holdings, and the offer is still on the table. Of course it is. You should have seen me selling these people. I was like fucking golden. All right, so here's the contract. Now, I looked this over and it's solid. I mean, this is a really good deal. But all you need to do now is you sign. You... you wanted me to sign it like right now? Why the hell else you think we're here? You said you wanted to sell, right? Hey, bro, seriously, it doesn't matter if it's a dude, if it's a chick, if it's some kind of animal, I don't know, just... I just wanna see my bro get his pee-pee touched. Like, for real. - You know, like... - What are you even talking about, bro? Like, I just wanna see you happy. For real, you come to LA, you're all like moody and shit. I don't know, like, I just... I mean, for real, like... Like, whatever happened with you and Juliet? He ended up calling. He's like, "Good thing I brought my Heelys," and he just like slid away. Nothing, that's what happened. Yo, remember she was dating Kev's dad back in high school for a bit? What the...? No, bro. That was a fucking rumor. That's not true. No, no, no, dawg, I definitely saw them making out at a party once. Like, hard. Thanks for telling me, dude. Oh, shit, I'm... I thought you guys were on a break. No. Fuck Reno. I wanna sell the place. But... I also... don't wanna go back to Reno. Then don't go back to Reno. Damn, dude, I've been trying to tell, like, Cosmo and all you boys to move down here for years. What the hell would we have done in LA? I don't know. What the fuck you been doing in Reno? Card declined. You have a credit card? Hey, Mom. This probably isn't true or anything, but my mom had mentioned there might be like, uh, an amount or something I could get monthly from the building. It's probably not even the case, right? Is that what you really want, kid? Money? - You wanna cash out on your dad's place? - Uh, you know, never mind. - Don't worry about it. - No, Lucas, hold on. I can't do it right now because I have a water heater to fix. But I'm happy to chip you something. But will you please just go introduce yourself to all the tenants first? You know, like a decent human being? So be nice, knock first and be polite. You're a pain in my ass, but thank you. My name is Lucas and I'm just going around the apartment, introducing myself to everybody. - No, I'm not falling for this bullshit. - What? Yeah, si, yes. No hablo español. No. Yeah. Hi. That's a... That's a big responsibility. - You up for it? - Do you know how to do that? I mean, you know, manage an apartment? - Oh, qualifications? - Qualifications. - You know, experience. - For the building, like, to run buildings? - Right, like... - No, I don't. Um, no, no, no. It's okay, thank you. No, no. I just came by to introduce myself. We're still figuring everything out. I'm just here to help. Hello. - Hi... - Uh, can you please just leave me alone? Have some eggs. They are good. Oh, no, I... I'm good. I have to go around the apartments today. You pig. Where's the papers? I don't speak English, so... Yeah, you just spoke English, though. Oh, no, I... I never spoke English in my life. - Frank should come in with you... - Um... ...because, you know, I'm... I'm not feeling ya. You know what, I... I agree with you. Oh, how about some chips? Make you strong. - Thank you. - You come back to see me, won't you? - Okay, yeah. - Yeah. Ugh. No sell. No sell. Get out of here! Hello? Oh, hi. Sorry, I didn't think anyone was home. No, I'm... I'm home. - Yeah, sorry, sorry, I'm being weird. - Yeah, you are. I'm just going around the apartment, introducing myself to everyone, and clearly I forgot it's you. - It's me. - Yeah. - So, hello, again. - Hi. Well, even though we've already met, I am Miss Sophie. It's a pleasure. My God, that's so official. Give me a handshake. The pleasure's all mine. Lucas Varela at your service. You're Augusto's son? I can't believe that he's gone. Yeah, it's weird. I feel like everybody knew him except me. And you're just taking over the place? No, no, I'm kind of like watching over the place until we figure things out. Who's we? Mm... me. It's... it's me. He, uh, kind of made me like the head of his estate. God, that sounds so British. Um... - It does. - I don't know why he did that, to be honest. Maybe it was his way to show you he loved you. Yeah, I don't know about that. I think so. So, uh, Tony Hawk, how's your hand? Maybe you can sign it like in high school. But just like maybe don't draw a dick on it. - Can't promise that. - I'd rather you not. So, uh, are you like an artist or something? - What is all this shit? - Mm, kind of. I mean, I make things sometimes, but my boyfriend, he's a DJ, so all the music stuff is his. - Oh, yeah? - Mm. I used to play in a band. - Like, back in high school. - Really? I bet you guys would get along really well. - Yeah? - You know what? Gavin! Gavin, baby, we have company. - Come say hi. - I'm trying to sleep. What are you yelling about? - Hey, bro. - What's up? Yeah, all right, well, guess I'm up now. - Mwah. - I love you, poopy. Mm, how do you guys know each other? Uh, Lucas is Mr. Varela's son. Mm, is that like a family friend or something? No, Augusto the... the landlord. Oh, shit. - Yeah. - Oh, dude, I'm sorry, man. God, I feel terrible. That must be rough. No worries. Appreciate that, though. Yeah, I... I didn't put it together. I've been texting him and he hasn't hit me back about the garbage disposal. It makes sense now. By the way, could you tell the janitor to fix it? It's been broken for a while. Yeah, yeah, I can, uh, hit him up. Appreciate it, bro. It... it has been really annoying. Oh, baby, uh, Lucas is from Vegas. Fuck you! No way! I spend like six months out of the year in Vegas. I'm a DJ. I open up for Tiesto at the Wynn. I'm actually from Reno. Oh, shit, fuck. I'm sorry, I got them confused. Nah, people get that mixed up like all the time, so. Okay. Wait, so you're not from Vegas? No, I'm from Reno. Oh. Well, why aren't you from Vegas? Reno sucks. How about some whiskey, Baby Face? Grandpa likes to party, huh? Grandpa thinks that you can't hold your liquor when you call a single glass of whiskey partying. Yeah. All right, I'll take a double, then. Ooh, bad boy. Uncle Tommy came by earlier today looking for you. Oh, yeah? Are you gonna call him back? Just been kind of busy. I heard that you met Mrs. Tuang. She thought you were a Mormon. She's been with us since the 1980s. Your pop has her rent locked. She pays something crazy like 500 a month for her two-bedroom. I don't know how she would get by. Yeah, yeah, I get it. Why are you here, Lucas? Well, I'm going around the apartment, introducing myself to the tenants like you asked. No. Why are you in Los Angeles? You know why I'm here. You didn't have to come. I mean, I guess not. Okay, I... I think that you're here because you wanna make peace with your old man. - Yeah, nah. - No. Maybe, maybe, a part of you really cares about your father, and you want to make things right. I think you're real off on that one. You know, most people think that, uh, a man is supposed to keep everything bottled up inside. But really it's much harder to open up. You read that on a poster at an AA meeting? Listen to me. I'm putting up with you because I promised your father that I would. But if you keep fucking with me, I won't hesitate to lay you out. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Ah, I was a lot like you when I was your age. Can I tell you something, Lucas? Yeah. Last year, uh... my wife. She was taken from me. I felt... I felt helpless. But, you know, a lot of people are going through shit like you and me. A lot worse, some of them. Whenever you feel like talking, you come over here, we'll have a couple of beers, we'll get some weight off our chests. How'd she die? Just like your old man. It's been a sad year for me, Lucas. Most mornings I just lay in bed. I have to fight with myself to struggle just to get up. I mean... why do you even get up? 'Cause I learned how to appreciate the small things in life. Find meaning in the small things. You know, the taste of a really good whiskey in a glass with a big old fat ice cube in it. I know, it doesn't seem like much to you, but, man, sometimes... it's all you're left with. Yeah, no. Actually, that sounds amazing. It just, uh... I don't know how I'd ever do that. You'll get there. For real, my ankle was broken straight over. - Like, done. - That's gross. It was gross, it was gross. But like the pain hadn't set in yet, right? So I popped that back in, hopped back on my board, tried the gap one more time. I landed that, and then I went straight in my homie's car to the hospital. That was your first clip on Thrasher. You were so darn cute. But that ain't shit compared to that crook on that 16 that Lucas crushed up. Damn, I'm telling you, this boy was a skate god. Was? Emphasis on "was." I saw this fool try to skate the other day and he was falling all over the place. - You were! - Okay, wow, all right. And whose wrist is broken and whose is not? That's because you pushed me off. - Oh! - He pushed me off. Eh, eh, no, no, no. Go back. You never said that you were skating again. I'm not. Yo, you remember that time Plug just like butt chugged a 40-ounce from the end of his board? - No... - Wait, why? Dude almost fucking died. So, you get your pole wet? Nah, we're just friends. You know she likes you, right? She's got a boyfriend. So? What the fuck does that mean? Hey, Tara has a husband and I still beat that up. You're a fucking animal. You know, and she's... could be your mom, you know that, right? I do. I fucking know that and it's fucking awesome, bro. Damn, 'cause she's like a mom that you can fuck. That doesn't sound right. Oh, no! Oh... No! What the fuck? No! Dude, I'm not saying I wanna fuck my mom. No, I'm saying she's like a mom you can fuck. Yeah, dude I know, I know, I get it. It just doesn't sound right. I understood what you were saying. I just want to see if you had any like water leaks or anything like that. I'm in the apartment above and there was just this pipe that randomly exploded. Wait, who are you? Uh, I'm Augusto's son. Yeah, but you're white. Half white. My mom is white. Yeah, you're like 100% white. Yeah, well, I guess you just kind of turn out looking like the parent you actually spend time with. So you just came down here to take over his apartment complex? No, it's not like that. I would never live here. I mean, if anything, I'll probably just like sell the place. - You're gonna sell the place? - Great. Go, go. Go, Ron. Turn on the Craig's List alerts for roommates - because we will be homeless. - Stephan, this is not helping. I can't believe this has happened! Just go have a cigarette. Calm down. - Calm down. - It's not for sure. It's not like it... - You're fucking with me, right? - I'm being serious, yeah. It was that time of the month for me and all my friends told me that it hurt to lose your virginity. - So, it happened. - How was that any better? Don't judge me. I see you judging me. All right, Brown Town, you do you. You want kids? Mm, I don't even know what I want, like, generally. Yeah, I don't think anyone does. And if they say they do, then they're probably lying. Do you want kids? Is it fucked up if I say I don't? No. - Really? - No, not at all. Yeah, I don't know. I'll... yeah, I'll probably have kids. Yeah. Sounds about right. - What do you wanna name 'em? - Hmm... I don't know. I haven't gotten that far. I don't even want kids now, so. What would you name your kids? I'm taking a huge shit! Thank you. Thank you for coming with me tonight. For sure. Any time. It's been really hard for me to make friends here. I mean, I have a million and a half friends, but tonight was really fun for me. Uh, you ever go to Vegas? See Gavin's shows? Uh, no, no, not anymore. You ready to roll, Tony Hawk? Yeah. - Ah... Oh, sure. - There you go. Your back okay? We need to get you some Viagra, stay strong? You're stronger than I thought, kid. - Shut up. - You know, bed bugs are no joke, Lucas. Listen, I bet you a thousand bucks if I asked you, "Hey, you itchy right now?" you'd scratch. Well, she's got a citation from a pest control company. Of course she does. Pest control companies bank on old ladies like that. And even if she does, how bad could it be, huh? - Okay. - I told you. - There are so many bugs. - Okay, yeah, but the spray is to get rid of the bugs. - You don't want the bugs, right? - I don't want the bugs because... - Okay. - ...at night time when I sleep, I have to put tissue paper in my ears and then wear a mask. - Okay, can I look at the bugs? - Uh, yeah, of course you can look at them. - Okay. - Yeah. Oh. Oh, fuck! Usually, night time, they're everywhere. I can even hear them with my tissue paper in my ear. And, oh, you know, even their poo poo are very small. But, oh, when there's a lot of them, they stink a lot. Okay, well, you need to clean up your place, please, first of all. - Seriously. - I'm an old and sick woman. - All right, okay. - There's only so much I can do. I hear ya. How long ago did a person come and check out your house for bugs? - How long has it been? - Uh, I don't know. I don't remember. Your dad always take care of it, yeah. Mm. I... I'm sorry. And I will call the bug terminator people. Oh, I love The Terminator. Very good. - How often does this happen? - No, The Terminator, the movie! Your dad showed me that one. My dad showed you The Terminator? Yeah, he was helping me study for my test to become an American citizen. We studied a lot. He told me about all the American heroes... Benjamin Franklin... John F. Kennedy, Arnold Schwarzenegger, all those things. Wait, Arnold Schwarzenegger was on the US citizen test? No, your dad and I, we had American movie night every month. I really enjoyed that. He, uh, brought a VHS of Terminator. Oh, I was so happy. Hamburgers and everything. I, uh, didn't know he was so patriotic. - That's weird. - Well, he learned all these things with me. Very supportive. Yeah, he was an amazing man. You know, it's just too bad. You'll never get to know him like that. Tonight you become a man. You watch this tonight, okay? Okay. You're terminated, fucker. What's up, bro? Cosmo? What you doing here? You have to guess. Don't tell me you moved to LA. I told Kieffer not to ruin the surprise. - Quit my job and everything. - Wow. Damn, you made the blankets and everything for me. Is it cool if I stay here for a little while, bro? Uh, that's me in there, so. Well, why aren't you staying in the regular room? I don't know, it's just been like... I'm clearing out my dad's stuff, and it's just been kind of weird in there for me, you know? That's tough. Well, I guess I'll stay in that room. Um... Dude, you can't ride that in here. I'm gonna be real here. If I was a ghost, first thing I'd do... girls' locker room. What? What do you mean the girls' locker room, bro? - Like, how old are these girls? - Yeah, what the fuck? Like, college. Volleyball age. Volleyball age? Word? - Okay, yeah. - What age is that? Lucas, just sleep in your dad's room, man. If he is a ghost, I guarantee you he's not in there. He's in a girls' locker room. - Dude! - I don't know, man. It's just kind of weird being around him like that. - Didn't even like the dude. - Dude, your dad was the shit. I mean, fuck, he took us to every competition. He let us eat whatever we wanted. - I smoked a joint with him once. - What? - No, you didn't. - No, seriously. We went to go pick up that truck. - He totally let me hit a joint. - Nah, you're full of shit. You're full of shit right now. You're just fucking with me. - How old were you, huh? - Damn, I wish I could've smoked a joint with your dad. Yeah, me too. That would have been tight. What's up? How are you? Eh, fucking around. What are you up to today? I was supposed to go check out my dad's beach spot, clear it out. Cool. Where? San Luis Obispo. You wanna come? It's like three or four hours away, you goof. Ah, shit, all right. Well, that's far. Never mind. Mm, you know what? No, uh, I'll come. You sure? 'Cause we probably wouldn't get back till like midnight. You know what, sometimes you don't always need a plan. Sometimes you just gotta like let go and have fun. - Live free, you know? - Word. You should open up a yoga studio. Are we taking the Mustang? Uh, that's my dad's. - I kind of feel weird driving it. - Yes? - All right. - That's a yes. Okay, I'm gonna go change. I just want you to know that I love you. Your mother loves you. Planet Earth has got a few more... - I told you we should have taken the Mustang. - All right, all right. - You were right. - I'm always right. You were right. ♪ Here I am ♪ ♪ And I never, ever Ever wanna be ♪ ♪ So alone ♪ ♪ I'm never gonna have to see ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ That I'll never, ever cry ♪ ♪ I'll go ♪ - ♪ Sunshine ♪ - ♪ Sunshine ♪ ♪ Sunshine's on my front door ♪ Well... I see where I get my organizational skills from. This is definitely your dad. These are cool. Oh... You know it's okay, right? It's okay to be weak sometimes. He left me a voice mail in the hospital. Yeah? What did he say? I deleted it before I could listen to it. Why? It just pisses me off knowing that I had this moment to go... Just to go off on him. For how fucked up he made me feel. And just like ask him why he left. I don't know. Maybe I just wanted to blow up on him so that I had this like second chance to reconnect with him. Or something. But I didn't. And now it's too late. What do you think he said? Probably some corny dad shit. Corny dad shit's the best. Yeah. All right, enough sad shit. Let's, uh, get outta here. Okay, let's do it. Okay. I don't wanna go home. - What? - When's the next time you and me are both gonna be here together? Can we just stay here for the night? Ha, get along now! I can't believe they have cable. Like, I can't remember the last time I watched something on cable. What? Cable's awesome. What do you watch on cable? - I... you just like turn it on. - Mm-hmm. And just like hope for the best. It's kind of beautiful. Mm-hmm. Okay. Eh, a lot of old people have cable in Reno. - Do you like it? - What, Reno? Mm-hmm, yeah. I don't know. It's nice. I mean, I hate it. But it's nice. Aren't there like mountains and stuff there? Do ever like go skiing or snowboarding or... anything like that? Mm, nah, not really. I used to go all the time when I was a kid. But I don't really go anymore. It's like when something's right there, you take it for granted. There's people like all over that come to Reno for vacation. Yeah, no, I get that. It's kind of what it's like in LA with the beaches. Mm-hmm. It's kind of fucked up if you think about it. I mean, why are we like that? Why is that our default? Guess it's just our human nature. Yeah. - This show fucking sucks. - What? - It sucks. - Walker, Texas Ranger fucking slaps. - What are you talking about? - You're ridiculous. I gotta pee. Sick, thanks for letting me know. You're welcome. You can tell me the truth if it's a number two. Shut up! Oh, my God, they have those cute little shampoo and conditioner bottles here. You wanna take a shower? Uh, we probably shouldn't do that. What are you talking about? I meant... Oh, I didn't mean together. Okay, yep. Sorry, um... Duh. Unless... unless you want to. Eh, Sophie? Still wanna go to that Madonna Inn place for breakfast? Eh, Sophie. Wanna get breakfast at the Madonna Inn place? Get out, Lucas. - Are you okay? - What... will you please get the fuck out, Lucas?! Come on. - It's one in a million that you meet someone like me. - Yeah. I'm telling you because I've met a lot of people here. So you always close? That's how I am, I close. - So... - I won't take no for an answer. - Look at this, look at this, look at this. - Hey. What? What happened? Uh, just kind of had like a rough night, so I'm probably gonna go to bed. It's cool, man. We're just gonna talk business in here. Cool, um, can you get off my bed? - This... this is your bed? - Yeah. Uh, but you do know that there is a bedroom, right? - And... - I know... I fucking... - Can you please just... - Is it because of your dad? - Is it because he slept in there? - No, no, it's not... - I just need some space. Can you please get up? - All right, all right, okay. Let's... listen, don't... Just, please, let me... Give me five minutes. We gotta finish this thing. Luke, this is big. All right? You could be done with this. So just give me a number, okay? Couple days, a week, two weeks? - Yeah, two weeks. - Two weeks? Ah! - That's fine. Thank you. - All right. That, I can work with. Oil's clean. Coolant's good. You know what, put the cable back on the distributor that's heating the coil. - Right here, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, all right. - Yeah, make sure it's tight. - How about that, huh? - Good. Good job, kid. Marine tattoo? Yeah, yeah. I served my country. I was in the Marines. Thought it was a jail tat at first. No. - Ever been to jail? - No. No, I've done some dumb things when I was a kid, but I was never dumb enough to get caught. You? Once. Yeah, painted a dick on a dumpster once. In middle school. Yeah, principal called the cops. Like, just to scare us and shit. And they actually fucking arrested us. It's so stupid. Kind of funny thinking back on it, though. Wow, that's, uh... That sounds dumb. I bet your mom didn't think that was too funny, huh? I don't even know if she found out, to be honest. They called my dad. I think that was like the last conversation, like real conversation I had with him. It's amazing. To think that some of the most important moments in our life... they don't seem important at the time. What was the last conversation you had with him? Well, it was right down here. Your dad was sitting over there on that dumpy chair. He was smoking a joint and he was laughing. He was interviewing me on this little recorder device. Pretending he was like Larry King or something. Did he do a good impression? No, no, no, that's why it was funny. Look, your dad... your dad had this quality about him, Lucas. You never knew what he was gonna do next, but you always wanted to stick around to find out. It was magic, just like this positive force. I guess I didn't get that from him. Oh, yeah, you did. Your dad would show me these VHS tapes of you skateboarding when you were a kid. You never shut the hell up. I don't know, man, it's like... I hate to say it, but, uh... the more I hear about him, the cooler he sounds. Kind of makes it worse that he had, uh... no reason to be around me. Sometimes what a man wants to do, and what a man is able to do are two different things. - Yeah. - Just remember that next time before you judge the man. Tamales! Tamales! Tamales! Ugh, really? Tamale, tamale, tamale! God, dude, fuck LA. God damn it. Yo, yo, need a hand? Uh, I'm good. I appreciate it, though. Aw, come on, I got you, big dawg. Like these things? Not really, I just didn't have any food at my place. You know who loves these things? Who? Sophie. Yeah. Yeah, she's obsessed. Yeah, last year for her birthday, I got the tamale guy to do a special appearance. He wore the sombrero, the whole thing. Oh, she fucking loved it. - Yeah. That's... that's cool. - Yeah. Yeah, it was cool. You know, I like to make her happy, I like to see her smile. - She's a good girl. - Yeah. Girls, you know, sometimes it just takes the simplest little thing. Oh, dude, the other night, I was DJ-ing... I'm a DJ... I was DJ-ing the other night at UCLA, and this sorority girl tried to suck my dick on stage. - Yeah? - Yeah! No, I'm lying. Yeah, dude. I mean, I didn't do it, of course. I don't cheat on my girl. I'm not... I'm not a fucking piece of shit, you know. - Yeah. - But I could have. And I could have cheated on her a lot of times, but I don't do it. - Mm. - Yeah, it's just bad karma. I don't... It's just not... You know what I mean? - It's just not cool. - Yeah. Yeah. So... - Do you mind? - Hmm? - Can I have a bite? - Sure. Yeah, my man. Haven't had one of these bangers in a minute. Oh, my God, this is the best! Mm! Anyway, here. Oh, and by the way, I know what's happening. Yeah, that key is for the apartment door and not the mailbox. You'll figure it out, homie. Later. Nice pants. - Hmm? - Nice pants. Oh. I mean, they're just black. Yeah, but they're cute. - Uh, is Kieffer here? - Who? - Guala Boy? - What you know about Guala? - We grew up together. - No way. So, a white nigga's talking about Guala Boy. Yeah, is he here? Bro, you ain't seen his Snapchat? This nigga's out here skating at P. Diddy's house. Naked bitches and shit, the whole nine. - P. Diddy right there. - Ladies. Want some coke? Uh, so, um, what do you do for work? Ralphs. - What? - Ralphs. I work at the deli at Ralphs. Oh, uh, uh... - You like it? - No, fuck, no. Okay. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not you. You're gay? Yeah, sure. Ugh, fucking... you fucking twat. Hey, this is Sophie. I'm not at my phone right now, so just text me. I don't know why people leave voice mails anymore. Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! How you doing? How are you, honey? I'm good. I just, uh, have something on my mind. I'm about to run into church. Can I call you later? Lucas? God damn it. You're looking like you're about to sink one in on the field over there, big dawg. - Huh? - You look like a lacrosse player with that thing. Oh. Uh, you play? Lacrosse? Nah, man. That always seemed kind of gay to me. No offense. - Well, I don't... I don't play lacrosse, so. - Yeah. Well, I'm out here just trying to get after it, you know? Never thought I'd be one of those kind of guys to get fit just for my wedding photo, but here I am. I'm that guy now, you know? Hmm. You, uh, guys going to a wedding, or...? No time like the present. Show him the ring I got, babe. It's a long time coming. Speak now or forever hold your peace. We're actually having an engagement party tonight if you wanna roll through. Don't even try it. Don't even try and convince me not to because I am so, so far past having made my decision. I'm selling the place. Well, I would say congratulations on making a decision, but you're on the fence, Lucas, I can tell. No, I'm not. You're fucking up, Baby Face. You're coming from a bad place. This isn't my mess. All right? I don't wanna babysit this apartment till the day I die. I'm not happy here, man. You're not happy here. You're not happy in Reno. You're not happy anywhere, Lucas. It's you. You're not happy. No matter where you are because it's in here and it's in here. Yeah, like you know best? The guy working in this pile of shit for some dead asshole. That's the problem with kids nowadays. You just want everything easy. Avoiding discomfort the second you feel it. Bet you haven't gone through your father's stuff yet, huh? Oh, God forbid, Lucas. God forbid that you find something that reminds you of your dad. - I'm sorry, but fuck him. - He loved you, Lucas. You... You were everything to him. Yeah. Loved me enough to show his face. There's two sides to every story. And it looks like you've only heard one. What the fuck does that mean? Your dad went to Reno to see you a lot. And your mom called the cops on him every time he went. He spent a night in jail just trying to see his son. Your mother, Lucas, she used you as a bargaining chip in their divorce. Your dad, he smoked a little bit of pot, but your mom, she wanted full custody to move on clean. Then why am I being told this now? Fifteen fucking years later, you're telling me this fucking now? It doesn't fucking matter! He's dead! I needed him ten years ago. And where the fuck is... Fuck, dude! Why am I fucking... even fucking angry about this shit, dude? - It's okay to be angry, Lucas. - It's not! It's not fucking okay! It's not okay that he did that! You wanna shoot the messenger, Lucas, go ahead. But like I told you, there's two sides to every story, and you don't really know your dad. Hey, Gavin! - That's your friend with the dead dad. - Yeah. - What's his name again? - Lucas. Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing, dude? - You don't deserve her. - Hey! Okay, no, no, Gavin, don't take... - Hey, watch out. - Oh, you wanna fight? You wanna... Come on, hit me, do it. Oh, shit! Lucas! Have you guys seen my lighter? Hey, hey, hey. Hey! - Yo, you're blocking the view. - Dude, just fucking turn it off! Turn it off for a second! I'm done, dude. I'm fucking done. I'm selling this place. Fuck LA. What? I'm selling the apartments. - To who? - I don't give a shit. I don't know, anybody. My Uncle Tommy's got some people lined up. I don't fucking know. - Is this about that chick? - No, it's not about... You guys seemed super happy last time we hung out. God, no it's not about the fucking chick. I mean, like, maybe part of it is. A'ight. Yo. This stays between us. The last year I almost quit the team. Can we just not talk about skateboarding for like two seconds? - It's a metaphor, Lucas. - Oh, God. Hey, just listen. I put so much pressure on myself. You know, like, just... It adds up, bro. Like, it just becomes too much. It's not fun anymore. Yeah. Yeah, so I just peaced out. You know, I didn't even tell anybody where I was going. I just bounced out of town for like three weeks. Didn't even take my phone. But when I came back, everything was fine. Damn, you didn't even invite me. Hey, all I'm saying is sometimes you just gotta like take a step back. For real, Lucas. Mm. Oh, shit, eh. You're the type of dude who'll kill at whatever you do. Unless it's being a landlord. Then you're fucked. Hey, you're up early. Um, yeah. Are you okay? I mean... no, I'm not. You're safe, though, right now, right? Yeah, I'm safe. Mom... I know you kept him from me. I should have let your father see you more. I'm so sorry, honey. I messed up. I messed up bad. I was trying to protect you, but I ended up hurting you more by not letting him see you. Your dad... total idiot. But he cared about you. He did. Parents, we're... we're just kids who somehow got old. Where do we go from here? What the fuck, dude? - I'm naked, get out. - Well, come on. What are you doing? The buyers, man, the buyers, they pulled out. Look, Uncle Tommy, at first I really appreciated you helping me out... but it's starting to seem pretty obvious you're like desperate for money. I mean, what's up, man? I'm in a lot of debt. I don't even know how I'm gonna make this month's mortgages. I have no idea. I was counting... Forget it. Maybe I can lend you some money from the apartments. Till you get on your feet. Would that help? Huh? Yes, yes. That would be great. And, I mean... there's also like 30,000 for the car and, uh, 10,000 for the boat. Yeah, I can't do that, man. I'm sorry. You're a good man, Lucas. Being an adult sucks. Yeah. It's, uh... it does blow. Hey, look, I don't wanna start any shit. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. Okay. Come with me. What? No. Where? It'll be like our version of The Graduate. I'm getting married in ten days. Ah, yeah, it's gonna take awhile. Probably should just like call the whole thing off. It's not funny, Lucas. I can't go with you. I mean, of course you can. But you don't want to. And that's what I came here to find out. Part of me really wants to, but I... I won't. Whatever happened to the whole "live free, follow your dreams, artist girl" shit, huh? Maybe I was just full of shit. Maybe I am just full of shit. You are so intense, Lucas. And I... I thought... I thought I knew what I wanted, but I just... I don't. Look, the only reason you think everything's fine all of the time is because he doesn't think about anything in a real way, ever. It's just like some bullshit illusion. Maybe I'd rather live in some bullshit, comfortable illusion than some dark version of reality. Did you ever think about that? I know that you think that I'm your answer, but I'm... I'm not. You know that whole thing that, like, "you can't love somebody unless you love yourself" thing? I mean, it's bullshit. Being there for somebody else when you're down, that's fucking real love. So, why'd you go on that road trip with me? I needed it. Just... something different. And you seemed like a lot of fun. Well... surprise. Yeah. I can't do it. Alone. I'm... I'm keeping the apartments, but, uh, I can't do it without you. What's this? You know that this doesn't legally bind anything. Yeah, I know. It's more of a symbolic thing. I was gonna ask Uncle Tommy to help me with his lawyer create something, but I'm pretty sure he's one of those legal shield scam artists, so. Yeah. I know, it was, uh, the best I could do. I'll see you around, Frank. Hey, Baby Face. Be well, my friend. Hey, Lucas. If you're listening to this, I'm probably dead. God... when did I get so old? I don't know if you're ever really ready to die, but, uh, maybe that means you've always been ready to die. Anyways, I wish things were different. I just wish we had a chance to just... hang out more, you know? I used to worry about you. A lot. But, uh, honestly, I'm not worried about you, Lucas. You always had a drive for something more, and I think that's a gift. Just don't be so hard on yourself all the time. Jesus Christ, you drove us crazy. Locking yourself up in the skate park bathroom. But life or death isn't life either. I think you get that from your mom. She's driven by the what-ifs of the world. The only way I know how to operate is by the what-is. I don't blame her, though. I do have to give her some major props. Jane... now that's a woman. Deep down, a real, tough bitch. In the most loving and amazingly unapologetic way possible. She did what she had to do to take care of you. I respect her for that. I think I always played the good cop to her bad cop. And it wasn't fair to her. She got fed up with it. Things changed. I let it happen. I just wish I... I knew how to tell you that. So, um... I'm sorry. You know, you're getting to be the age when I became a dad. Weird, right? Gonna be honest here. I never thought I wanted kids. And, man, I tell you, it is not a conversation you wanna have with a pregnant woman. That definitely bit me in the ass. What tore me up is after you were born, I still didn't want a kid. But I... I wanted Lucas. When you were a kid and I started skating with you, I fell in love with it because I finally found a language to speak with you. But you learn other languages. And, uh, with the apartments, they're important. Not because of the cash or superficial value, but because I wanted to leave you something that you could use. Something you could have as a man, you know. I'm not gonna tell you how to manage it or to even manage it at all, but there's definitely some things worth learning from the tenants. I have some stories you might get a kick out of. But I am just enjoying the process. You may too. Whatever you do, I just want you to know that I love you. And planet Earth has got a few more rotations in it. Oh, and also... there's a really wonky pipe under the bathroom sink. Get Frank to help you with that before I forget. You don't need that kind of drama.
