GRAVE ROBBERS Oh! No! My God! No! No! No! No! You'll give birth to a boy before nine moons. He'll be King and all us will be his servants. No! No! Satan, today I'll father your son to fulfill the sixth prophecy! Oh my God! No, no, no. No. No! Confess your pact with the devil, so that the Lord Almighty has mercy on your spirit. For some reason we cut off the heads of the heretics of your enemies. Why do you want to kill me?! I'm not sentencing you to die. It's your ambition. Your weakness of spirit. You betrayed the Lord, when he had made you a noble executioner of his church. Yes! Yes, I did! And you should too! Satan is the true Prince, the true King. Repent, before it's too late! Rot in hell. Someday someone will come and take the axe from me, and then I'll come back with more strength to father the son of Satan in one of your descendants, and that day the entire San Ramon will repent. MUNICIPAL PUBLIC SECURITY DIVISION What's up, Captain? Where are we going? You just follow me so you can wake up. Let's go. I've always said you're a good engineer, but I never thought you were such a good gunsmith. I still can't figure out what you did to make it work. Let's test it and see how it turned out. It's really a miracle after so long. It's missing some adjustments, but it's nothing. Don't worry, I don't think I need it. In this town, even flies don't get killed. I know. Very good. Hello, Dad. - Hi. - Hi. - We're leaving. - Where are you going? Some friends from Mexico City came and we're going to spend the weekend in the country. You know how Chilangas are. They love sleeping outdoors and think they'll get rid of the snob with that. And who gave you permission? Not me yet, huh? - My future husband. - Well, yes. They can go. Besides, I think I'm big enough to take care of myself. - Well, take good care of yourself. - They're here for us. See you. - Bye. - See you. Take care. Have fun, take care. Olivia, if you're going to light a fire remember to put it out. - Don't cause a fire like last time. - Don't tell me you didn't have fun. What fun? Take care. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? What's up? How are you? - Fine. - Fine. -Hi! - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. - Let's go. Let's go. We have to walk from here. Well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to help us? Hey, what the hell? We've been freezing, the potholes are very hard and you're going super fast too. Look, robbing cemeteries is not easy. So you stick to what we have or rather... Or rather what? Huh? Or rather you leave. I've had enough. Go to hell. Okay, enjoy what you find. Jorge! Andrea! Don't go, come back! Don't worry about them. They'll come back in a while. Better help us get things down. This is the place. I'm sure. I hope you're right this time. Hopefully, because we've already visited seven cemeteries and haven't found anything. In this town, people were buried with gold offerings. They think gold helps them find their way to Heaven. - Put it up! - Oh, this is so hard. Help me put down the roof. Mr. Francisco Cacique. Here? - Yes, it's here. - Are you sure? I'm sure. There's so much gold down there I can almost see it. Oh, what are Jorge and Andrea doing? Who knows? Hey. Watch out for the gas. Watch out for the gas. Diana, hand me the screwdriver and the hammer fast. Fire it up. There's nothing. "There's so much gold down here I can almost see it." Hey no. I'm sure... Let's see, help me get down. Let me go. I don't know what happened. I still feel a lot of gold. You don't believe me, do you? Rebe! Rebeca! - Rebe! - Rebeca! Rebe! Rebeca! Armando, get behind me. I'll go down. No, Manolo! Rebeca! Rebe! Rebeca! Rebeca! Rebeca! Are you okay? Answer! Rebe! Go down carefully. Be careful. Easy, Manolo. There you go. That's it. Be careful, Manolo. Slowly. Easy, Manolo. Be careful, Manolo! Slow down, Manolo. No way! What are we going to do? I'm fine! Rebeca! Rebeca! Rebeca! Reba... You scared me! - Are you okay? - Yes, but let's get out of here. Calm down, I'll get you out. You see, what a wonder. Armando! Armando! Drop the rope and both go down! What rope and coming down? Let's get out of here please! Shut up! Everything will be fine. How is the descent there? - Just throw yourself. No problem! - Manolo. Hand me the pick, the shovel, and the lamp. Damn! Hand me the lamp, Diana. Manolo, you'll pay for this! - Laugh, you asshole. - You're annoying. - Manolo? - What? What is this place? How could I know? It looks like a basement. - Yes, but a basement for what? - How should I know? - It scares me a lot. - Calm down. We're all together. Nothing will happen. - A bunch of assholes. - Oh, don't worry. What do you mean? They'll pay for this. It's gold, Diana. - Gold for us! - Oh God. No way! Look! Jewelry. I knew you couldn't fail me. Hey, come on! There's more here! Even more? These are for my mom. We're rich! Rich! Thank you. Thank you! - Manolo! - What? Look, come see what I found. Hey, wait. Leave me the lamp. Whatever you want, huh? Watch this. What? I don't speak English. Don't be a fool, it's Latin. There must be much more here than there. What are you waiting for, huh? Let's get the Latin out. - Imagine what we'll get for this. - We've found this much. No. I want to go on a trip. Oh no, I want to buy clothes. Lots of clothes. Diana! Watch this. It's amazing. Leave that crypt alone. And now what's happened to you? I don't know. But there is something I don't like. We already have enough, Manolo. Settle for this and let's get out of here. Don't start with your superstitions, Rebe. Let us work. She's right. We better get out of here before we're caught as grave robbers. Grave robbers? No. We're archaeologists starting today instead, right? Exactly. Come on. I think that's it. Come on. Let's go. Fire it up. Fire it up. Come on. Super heavy. Pick it up there. That's it. That's it. You were right, Armando. We're rich. We're rich! We're rich! No, no, don't come close. Since you didn't want to help us, all this is for Manolo and me. Look, Armando, rules are rules. What you find is for everyone. What do you think this guy did to get killed so badly? Don't touch it. I warn you, if you touch that axe you'll regret it. Rebeca, please. It's okay, huh? Do you want to see? Besides, this thing seems to be worth a lot of money, huh? Do you want it? No, thanks. You keep it. Rebe is right. Something weird is happening. Leave that and let's get out of here. Geez, this is all we needed. I don't care, let's go. Jorge, we have to go back. Armando, let's get out of here. Don't be afraid, Diana. How about I give you this for a party? Manolo, I warned you not to do that. I feel something very bad will happen. Rebe, please. Stop the nonsense. Armando, let's go! Help me, Rebeca. Diana, up. Hand me the stuff. Hurry up! - Come on, Manolo. - There you go. Let's get out of here! - Give me your hand. - Come on! - What are you laughing at? - Let's get out of here, please. Hurry up! Wow. Let's go directly to Mexico City to sell all this and become millionaires. No, we're already here. We better come back tomorrow to see what else we can find. Are you crazy? - I've had enough of these things. - What's up? Did you get enough or you're scared now? If you say it's because of the fog and the wind that started down there, it was a coincidence. I don't believe in nonsense. And I say it is because we already have too much. There's no need to risk more. Let's go to Mexico City and everyone can do whatever they want. Okay. You're right. Now what's happened to this crap? Why isn't it turning on? Yay, finally! - Ready. - Let's go. Armando, hurry or I drive. Calm down, we're leaving. What's going on now? I think it's the mud. Let me see what's happening. Stop hitting the gas. We're stuck. - Get down to push. - In this rain? Yes, in this rain. Both of you. Don't get me wet. One! - Two. - Three! Harder! To the front! - Hit it! - Go back! What are you doing? Go back! And what do you think I'm doing? We can't! Watch out! Stop it now! Stop! Don't accelerate anymore! Armando, don't accelerate! Let's go to the truck. - Oh I'm cold! - Geez! No way. It's impossible. We need someone to help us out. Why don't we go to town and ask someone for help? We won't get anywhere with this rain. Look, how strange. The rain is already going. Evening. Evening. Do you have a problem? No, no. None. We can help you unclog the truck if you want. Okay, yes. Thank you. 80 nice. Diana, hand me the jewels. Hide them. Get down. So lucky you went through here. Yes, we really thought we were going to get stuck all night. You were really lucky. I think so too. This place is very dangerous. Can you hold the horse please? Jacinta! Pablo, I'll be right back. I'll go get Jacinta. Jacinta! Jacinta! That sneaky mare. Jacinta? Jacinta? Jacinta? Jacinta? Jacinta? Jacinta? Wait a moment. I'll see what happened with my friend. What happened? Hey, did you grab the axe? No, I didn't. And you? - No. - Not at all. Why? Because it's gone. Did they take it? They didn't even come here. - Won't they want to hurt us? - No. They're peasants. Tono? Tono? No! You guys stay here. Let's go. What happened? I don't know, but let's get out of here. Hey, Rebe, what's going on? I don't know. But I'm afraid of being here alone. Me too. Manolo? Armando? Manolo! Armando! Armando! Manolo? Armando! Where are you? Shut up. Shut up. Don't move! Police! Let's see. You, your hands! Your hands! You have a lot to explain. And the jewels? I hid them near. I warned you. This is a curse. Everything that's happening is your fault. 80 nice. Walk. Get in. Come on. Get in. Come on, don't look like that. Come on. The bodies have already been removed, Captain. It seems they were killed with a heavy and sharp object. Probably a machete. Take them to the police station. Ask them to pick up the truck - and we'll meet there. - Okay, Captain. What's your name? - Monica. - I want to know the truth. The truth! Rebeca de la Huerta. And you? - What about me? - What's your name? Manolo. - Manolo what? - Manolo Andrade. Who are your parents? - Pedro Negrete and Teresa Alvarez. - Hey. I swear to you we had nothing to do with the death of the peasants. But you know if you let us go there's some money. Don't play the clown because it can be worse. Remember you're detained under suspicion of murder. I want to know everything, understood? And you, where did you get these jewels? Tell me! Answer when you're asked! Okay, Captain! Okay, leave him alone! We're grave robbers, happy now? We live on that. We just took it from those who no longer need it to give it to those who can use it. Tell him about the axe. What axe is she talking about? We were in the cemetery looking for things among the graves. We found a passageway and it led to a very strange crypt like... like very ancient. There was a very large skeleton with that axe stuck in its chest. We liked it and we took it out. That's all. This was embedded in the axe, Captain. It was in the back of the truck. We didn't know who it was, but it was stolen from us. And the blood on your hands? I tripped and fell near one of the bodies. Why don't you come with us to the crypt? And you'll see everything we're saying is true. Why don't you go to the cemetery to be convinced? All in due time. Take them. - Walk. - You too. Come on. Eagle one. Eagle one. Go on. We have two bodies at kilometer two of the Mexico highway. Apparently, the same murderer. No way. What time did that murder occur? About 10 minutes ago. Still there? Affirmative, Captain. The corpses are still fresh. Give them to the coroner. Over and out. Raul! Raul! - What's up, Captain? - Where's the machine gun? I have it in the bedroom, why? What's going on? A strange killer is on the loose, and I'm afraid he's close to where Olivia and her friends are. Hey, Fer, how about we get the equipment out? Okay. Let's see, let's see. Camera? Camera. Roll 36, color exposure? Here it is. - Tomorrow, the alarm at 6 o'clock. - Oh, so boring. If you'd have told me you're going to take photos of the birds - then I wouldn't have come. - Oh, come on. I'm going to get water, who is coming with me? - Not me. - Me neither. - Me neither. - Oh, don't be bad. - It's very dark. - Yes, it is. Please. No? You're bad. Be careful because the vampires come out after raining. Oh, stop it. Let's see how bad. S54, Captain Lopez speaking. Answer, Lalo. Go ahead, Captain. I'm going to Cruz Blanca. I might need help. Come soon. I'm going right now, Captain. Over and out. - Vicky? - Vicky? Vicky! - What happened to her? - I heard her screaming. Look! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky? Vicky! Vicky? - Vicky! - Vicky! - Vicky! - Vicky! - Vicky! - Vicky! No! Open the glove box. I hope there's no need to use it. No! The keys! The keys! - I don't have them. - Hurry up! I dropped them. I already saw them. - Where are they? - Back here. I'll get them. Be quiet. No! Stop, stop. There's the camp. Olivia! Captain! Look at this. We arrived late. Olivia! Olivia! Come on! - You cover this side, I go this way. - Okay. Olivia! Olivia? No! No! Please no. Raul! Calm down. Calm down. Calm down! It's all over. It's all over. Calm down. - Wait for me here. - No, Raul. No. No, no! No! Be careful, Raul! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Raul! - Let's get out of here. - No. No! Dad, Raul! No! No! Raul! Dad! Dad! No, Raul! Let me go for Rail, Dad! Take her right now to the house and protect her! What's going on, Captain? - I'm telling you to take her! - Okay! Come on! Get in! Get in! Drink. Come on, drink. This will get you warm. Ready? Go to your room to change, okay? - Go on. - Okay. I'll wait for you here. Go on. Father! Father! Father? Father! Father? Father? Who's there? It's me, Father. Captain. I need to talk with you. How can I help you? Father... you are the only one who can read Latin. I need you to help me figure out what mystery this book holds. The shield of the Holy Inquisition. What's going on, Captain? Why are you in such a hurry? Several people have died and more will die if we don't do something. A strange killer is on the loose. And I think this book has the answer. And what should I look for? I don't know. It's not my place, but in that killer... there's something supernatural. It's like he's the devil. I get it. Come back later. Thanks, Father. MUNICIPAL PUBLIC SECURITY DIVISION Jorge. Manolo. Rebeca. Where were you, idiot? We're in deep trouble. They're blaming us for two murders. - I know. We saw everything. - Open! What's up Armando? What's wrong? Manolo! - Manolo! - Shut up, kid. Manolo, help me! Manolo! Come here! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo, please! No! Let me go! - Armando. - Let me go! Armando! Manolo, please let me go! No! No! Jorge! Jorge, no! Andrea! Jorge! Wake up! The keys! No! Let me! Give them to me! Let's get out of here! And Diana? Where's Diana? Diana! - There's the truck. - Let's go! Manolo! Diana! Hurry up! Hurry up! Andrea! - Let's go! - Armando! Let me go! What's wrong with you? Andrea! No. Get in the truck! Get in! The keys! Let's go! What's happening? What's happening? Hurt... Diana! Diana! Diana! Diana! Damn you Satan! In the name of God Almighty, I order you to stay away from here. Damn you Satan! Father! Father? Father? Father? Father. Father! He has... a satanic pact. He's... looking for a virgin woman... to father... the son of Satan. The Antichrist. You have to finish him off. It's not possible. I've shot him several times and he doesn't die. The axe. You have to stick... the axe in his chest. What else? I need to know more. There's... a small satanic sphinx. It's part of the axe. The book. The book. We need to go. - Let me help you. - No. Hurry! Go! Destroy him! Okay, Father. I'll come back for you. Oh my God. Lab? Lalo! Lalo! Lab? What are you doing? The Captain's daughter is in danger. We have to help her! No! You're crazy. - You want us to be killed too. - It's our duty. It's our fault that thing came to life. - Let's help the Captain, Manolo. - No! We can no longer help anyone. We're leaving here. Think of Diana and the others. We owe it to them. Olivia! Lalo! Olivia! Olivia? No! No! No! No! No! No! Help! Help! Dad! Help me! Stay calm, daughter. Calm down. Hurry up. No! No! No! No! Dad! No. No! No, no! To the left. Where is it? Only God knows. I don't know how I listened to you. The Captain. What happened? Where is it? I don't know how, but it disappeared. Thank you. You saved my life. Boy, there's a box with dynamite near the crypt. Bring it. Now you believe us, right? Shut up, Manolo. Hurry, Captain, your daughter is in danger. Let's go. Captain! Distribute the dynamite everywhere. - We'll tear that damn thing apart. - I already did enough. We'll get out of here. Look, boy, if you don't help me, you're going to spend 10 years in jail for grave robbery. Understood? Get me out of here, Dad. Listen to me well. Get her in the truck and you go directly to town. Okay, Captain. Come on, daughter. Everything's fine now. Come on. - Come with us, Dad. - I'll meet you in a second. - Take her. - Let's go. - Take her. - Let's go! Hurry up, boy. And what do you think I'm doing? Let's go! Light the fuse! Manolo! Go away! Let's go! Let's go! Dad! Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God. - Dad! - No! Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Blessed is the fruit of your womb. Holy Mary, Mother of God. Dad! Dad! Dad. Dad. Are you okay? Dad. - Are you okay? - Yes, Daughter. This horrible nightmare finally ended. It's not so easy to get rid of me.
