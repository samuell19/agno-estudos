- Did you wait long? - No, I didn't. It’s pretty cold, huh? Yes. Did you bring it? Yes. Does it look okay? You brought this because it is good, right? Otherwise you'd never bring it, or are you that stupid? Of course not. I’m joking. I heard that you make our products impure and sell them. Is that true? Is it? Who told you that? The question is, is it true or not? Of course that’s not true. I thought so. My bad. I’ll see you next month, then. Okay. Yo, Please! Stop! Please! Can you even hear me? Yo! I can pay you! ...I’m sure Tamura will take care of it. Yes. Okay. Don’t worry, he’ll do it perfectly. He's really good. Did you know that Mr. Hayashi works at a staffing agency? No, I didn't. You didn’t? Well, now you do. According to him, you can find the best job offers in a magazine called... What was it? It slipped my mind. What was it? I’ll tell you when I remember, okay? Okay. Today I cooked too much rice. Please eat more than usual, okay? Okay. - You too. - Okay. - It’s very good, as always. - Thank you. Yes. Oh, you haven’t taken a bath yet. No. Sorry, I thought you did. So I emptied the tub. I'm going to refill it. Can you wait for a minute? It’s fine. I’ll just take a shower. No! You can't refresh yourself that way. I said I’m good. You should take a hot bath and relax and... It’s fine! Just leave it. Excuse me. Juice? Thank you. Now hiring Kazuhiko? It’s Yuri, remember? You're not Kazuhiko? I'm so... I'm Kazuhiko. You are, right? I got scared for a second. If you were a stranger, I didn’t know what to do. Long time no see. Remember me? Yeah. Yuri, right? Do you really remember me? Yeah. Yuri, right? I haven’t seen you since high school graduation. What a coincidence. That's right. Do you come here often? It's my first time. Oh, is it? I’m not even wearing makeup. You're just out of the bath. That’s why. That’s right... Do you come here a lot? - Yes, sometimes. - Is that so? There are times that I prefer a more spacious bath. The one in my house is too small. You live on your own? Yes, I do. Oh, okay. Well, I’ll see you around. Okay. Are you going to the reunion party? I think you're in the text group. Yes. Are you going? - To where? - The party. I don't know. I haven't decided. You went to Tokyo University, right? Yes. I did. Right. You’re very smart even back then. Not really. Will you be too busy to go to the reunion? Yes. Oh... I just thought that we could have a longer chat then. - I’ll go then. - Seriously? Yes. Great. Well, I'll see you there. Yes. Well... - What is it? - Be careful, it’s cold outside. I will. Thank you. You want Kodera? Yeah. When can I get him? But... Everyone is so understaffed lately, huh? Aren’t you done yet? Give me a minute. You already said that. I want to eat. Just shut up and wait! Don’t shout at me! Shut up or go outside. I can't run my bathhouse without Kodera. That's your problem. - I'm hiring now, so give us a little more time. - Hey, listen. Kodera is a very good killer. He was born for that job. How long do you want to keep a man like him doing just bath jobs? He can’t fold bath towels forever! It's his decision. That’s it! I’m starving! Go hurry up! What are you going to do now? You still have a lot of tasks to finish. What do you mean? Go fire Kodera and hand him over to me. - Okay, but... - Mister! Remember how much you owe me? How dare you say “but” to me? Angela. How about curry for dinner? Curry? Again? - Are you joining us, Mr.Azuma? - No, thank you. Then, see you. - Hey, guys. - Oh, hi! - Is this your restaurant, Tamura? - No. I just invested when it started. Invested!? That's so cool! Can you play the piano for us? Oh, I want to hear it! No, no, it’s okay. Please! Even just one piece. Alright, just one. Deal? Kazuhiko? You came. You should’ve told me. Well, I don't have your number. That’s true. I’ll give it to you now. Let’s go over there. That's kind of interesting... They're not even trying to hide their intention. Tamura wasn't that popular when we were in high school. They didn't pay attention to him then, and now, that... I heard he started a company and succeeded. That's fantastic, isn't it? Yeah. And you, Kazuhiko. You went to Tokyo University. Yeah. ...Huh? What do you do now? Oh, yeah, well... I’m kind of taking a break. - Taking a break? - Yes. Did you quit your job? Yes, I did. Was it because it’s too hard? Yes. Excuse me. Tokyo University graduates experience many things quickly, huh? That's not true. It’s nothing special. I got an idea. Why don't you work at that bathhouse? Why? I saw that they’re hiring. And thought, it won’t be too hard. And... Since I’m there from time to time, I think it's going to be more fun. I'll think about it. I bet you’ll never work there. There you go. Bravo! So you went to Tokyo University. Yes, I did. You've been a part-time worker ever since the graduation? Yes. Why? What do you mean? Just curious, but... Why do you work only part-time? I'm sure you're smart. Wouldn’t anyone question that? I don’t really have a particular reason. You're hired. Thank you very much. There's another interview today. Can you wait? Okay. You two might work together. Okay. I understand. You're Matsumoto? Yes. Your handwriting is hard to read. Why is that? Anyway, you're hired. Do you like to clean? I would say, I like having a bath. Oh. That's good. Well, thank you. You two, get along well. Hey. Do you know the bathhouse called Matsuno-yu? Isn't that around the corner of Koike's house? Where Kazuhiko went before. When? The night you emptied the bathtub. I got a job there. It starts tomorrow. Oh, really? How come... a bathhouse? Doesn't matter. Good luck. Right. Good luck. Okay. The miso soup is different today. Do you like it? Let's see. I like it. Good. I like it. Shit. Hi. I started today and... You're Matsumoto, right? Yeah. Hello. Hello. I heard that you went to Tokyo University. Yes, I did. Do you like bathhouses? Is that why you're here? Yeah. If you say so. Good evening. Thanks. Oh, hi. Until what time? Huh? What time do you finish? Maybe around 12. How about a drink after that? What? But... Why not? I'll just be at home waiting. Just call me when you're done. Okay. Well, see you later. See you. Enjoy. I was so surprised. Who would've thought that you would work there? I know. How come you decided to work there? No particular reason. Because you can see me there? No. Let me ask you. Why do you go there so often? What? Didn't I tell you? Sometimes, I just prefer a more spacious bath. And still, you're there too often. Shut up. I think I understand. You really like taking a bath. Another round? What a view. Yes. Are you okay? You drank too much. Watch out. There's a hole. It doesn't look safe. I can go through. What are you doing? You're so drunk. No, I'm not! Your alcohol tolerance is too low. Yes, it is! You know it is! You want to take a bath? No. It looks like somebody's still in there. I feel sick. Are you okay? Use the bathroom here? No. I just want to go home. Okay. Then, let's go! I won't let you in, though. I know. Shut up. - Mr. Azuma. - What? What were you and Matsumoto talking about? I mean, back there. Why do you ask? Was there anything wrong with our work? Listen, Kazuhiko. Here's some advice. Okay. It's dangerous to know something you're not supposed to know. So, don't get involved with too many things. I'm just kidding. See you tomorrow. See you. Where is Matsumoto? He just left. Oh, okay. Well, see you. Okay. Hey. Hey. Sorry for making you do this. Don't be. I'm just trying to return the favor to you. Don't worry. I'm not thinking about killing Tanaka. Anyway... Thanks to those two, we can keep running this bathhouse. Yes. Matsumoto should work harder, though. Anything wrong? Why are you here? I'm sorry. Shit. Stop! Don't kill him. What? Can you stand up? I'm standing now. Come inside. As you can see, this place is used this way after closing. You mean... What? Speak up. - Killing people? - Yes. Okay. It's easy to clean up the mess here. Well, Kazuhiko. You're part of this job from now on. Me? Don't worry. Just cleaning up. Killing is Kodera's job. Cleaning up means... Obviously, customers can't take a good bath like this, right? I guess. You don't have to worry. Kodera has been doing this all alone. Taking people here and killing and cleaning up. And also, taking care of bodies. So, you can ask Kodera if you have any questions. So... Can you clean up by yourself? Yes. Are you alright? I am. Well, I'm counting on you. It's burning very well. What made you start doing this job? I mean... Well, good night. Good night. Finished? Yes. Just now. Looks good. Take this. A bonus. The job is dangerous. So, take this. Thank you. Kazuhiko. Yes? I think it's obvious, if you tell anyone about this, I'm sorry but we must kill you. Okay? Yes. I'll get going. Lock up when you leave. Oh, good morning. You're from work? Yes. I got a lot of things to do. - The bathhouse? - Yes. Get some rest. See you later. See you. Graduation certificate - Tokyo University Did you know Tanaka is a good cook? Oh, really? I can't wait. Mr. Azuma, you have a bathhouse, right? I do. - Does it make good money? - Money? It doesn't? Or does it? It doesn't very much. - What? It doesn't? - No, not much, really. Then why are you doing that job? I wonder why too. There it is. Looks delicious. Omelette rice. Enjoy. You're such a good cook. I guess so. I've been on my own for a long time. Ever since the divorce. This girl only comes here once in a while. Eat it before it's cold. It should be good. Okay. Well, thank you. It's good, huh? It's good. I'm surprised. Angela. Okay. All right. Well... Kodera begins to work full time for me this month. Yes. I want to use your bathhouse as it is. You're taking Kodera from me and still want to use that place? Eat it. You think that giving me Kodera pays all your debts? Do you really think that's how it works, Mr. Azuma? You're asking too much. New assignments. By the end of this month. - This month? That's not possible. - It is. - But... - Mr. Azuma. You still don't understand? Now you do. - Kazuhiko. - What? You're in a good mood, huh? Is that fun? Yeah. Kind of. Any good news? Yeah. Kind of. What is it? You didn't sleep? Not so much. What is it? Just tell me. Nothing special. That's annoying. Hey, hey. What is it? I told you, nothing special. Something did happen! Nothing. Nothing happened. What is it? Really! I told you! Nothing! I'm completely normal. No, you're not! - You're acting weird! - What? I'm completely normal. Mr. Kodera. Is there going to be THAT THING tonight? There is. Okay. Welcome. I'm going to meet someone tonight, so... Okay. Don't worry about it. Sorry. Okay. Next time, I promise I'll help you. Okay. Sorry for being late. I feel nervous. Why? This place looks expensive. Are you not used to this? Of course I'm not! Here's the wine list. Well, the chef's choice, please. Certainly. Thank you. Do you come here often? Not really, but yes. Please be my girlfriend. What? I like you. That's so out of the blue. You're saying NO? I haven't said anything yet. The answer is YES. - Yeah? - Under one condition. What is it? Let's choose a casual place for our next dinner. I don't mean I hated it tonight. It is very delicious. But this place makes me nervous. I understand. Thank you. Let's eat. What? Are you okay? Yes. Here? Yes. So, see you later. Okay. - I'll text you. - Okay. - Matsumoto? - What are you doing here? - Why did you come here? - What are you doing! Kazuhiko? Mr. Kodera! Matsumoto. - It's okay. Let him go. - But... So... Can you two clean that up together? Yes, of course. Why is he doing this job? - What do you mean? - Because that's... Anyway, I want you to do your job. I'm in a rush. The job can be done faster, thanks to you. I appreciate it. - Did you hear about it? - About what? - About last night. - Yes, I did. - Why did he... - Kazuhiko. To be honest, I was going to assign the job to Matsumoto from the beginning. Last time was just an accident. - You think Matsumoto is better? - Considering this type of job, I thought Matsumoto is more suitable. And you think I'm not? I'm not saying you can't do the job. Well, I talked to Kodera about it, and... Are you listening? Yes. You're the boss of the normal bath job. While Matsumoto is the boss during the night job. That's the way we want it. - Matsumoto is my boss? - At night, yes. You're his boss during daytime. Okay? I understand. That's good. When is the next time? I mean, the night job. In a minute. Is she your type? What? Don't be stupid. You were staring at her. I was wondering why she had to be killed. - Why do you have that thinking? - Who doesn't. Well, you shouldn't. It kills you. Get the job done without thinking anything. That's how you should do it. I have to go, Mr. Azuma called me. - Where is he? - He already went out earlier. And I'm supposed to go now. - Why is that? - What do you mean? Why are you supposed to go? I think we'll have a meeting about the next assingment. Can you do the cleaning? Okay. Fine. Thanks, man. See you later. It's time to eat. Who could it be at this hour? Yes? Kazuhiko? Sorry for coming this late Make yourself at home. Thank you. I'll make you some tea. Anything wrong? Good morning. Good morning. You've been awake? Yes. You didn't sleep well? I was thinking about something. About your job? Yes. Something like that. What time is your work today? - It's my day off. - Good for you. - How about you? You're going to work? - I am. It's going be busy because a new lipstick is out today. - A lipstick. - Yes. What? You're not interested in cosmetics, I know. I'm interested because it's your job. You don't have to try. I'm not trying. - Stop grabbing my belly! - Why? It's time to go. I'll be late! Get some more sleep. Sorry for calling on your day off. It's not only a night thing. We have only two hours till the open. Get this done quickly. Got it. Mr. Azuma. Where is Mr. Kodera? He left right after that. He's very busy, huh? Yes, very busy. Clean this up quickly, please. - Of course. - Thank you. I have to go. Okay. Will you do the rest? What? I have to go and meet Mr. Kodera. - Really? - Yes. I don't know if I can get back before opening time. Can you take care of everything? Does it have to take that long? You were off today, right? I'm really sorry. I'm fine. Well, there's one more thing. Can you wait till Mr. Kodera and I come back? What time would that be? No idea. - Okay. - Really? That really helps. Worst case scenario, we'll bring a man here and kill him. Okay. Thank you so much. See you later. Fuck. Fuck. Are we going? Here. Are you really coming? Yes. You can stay in the car. You're going alone? That's crazy! You'll be outnumbered, right? Well... Azuma told me it's not your first time. It's not. I'm going with you anyway. Show me the photo one more time. Shall we? I guess I've been doing this for a while. Mr. Kodera!? Kazuhiko, get some towels! Towels! - Quickly! - Okay! I'll call an ambulance! Wait! Where is Mr. Azuma? He's not here. Hello...? Yes. Okay. Anything else? Okay. I'll be there in a minute. Mr. Tanaka. What? Kodera is dead. He got shot? Looks like it. How about Sawada? Good job. Well, excuse me. I got a question. Did he go in Sawada's office alone? Yes, he did. He broke in there alone? That's crazy. I told him the same thing. I'm not sure if I can do jobs for you without him. Go find a way. Please give me some time. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Matsumoto. I hate to ask you this, but... Take care of Kodera as usual. Okay. Matsumoto. You came back safe. I was just lucky. Were you? Yes. Did you get the man? The target. Of course I killed him. Is that so. You did well. No big deal. We'll do that. You don't have to. You must be tired. A little. Take a bath before you leave. This is amazing. You don't fully trust me, do you? Huh? You're thinking that I shot Mr. Kodera. I'm not. That's good, then. But I was wondering who you really are. - Mr. Azuma didn't tell you anything? - No. In short, I kill people for a living. It's not so violent as it sounds. I mean, I only kill yakuza-related people. And the ones who hire me are also yakuza, that's why. So, is Mr. Azuma a yakuza? No, he's not. He's just like me. He takes jobs from yakuzas. Jobs? For example, using this place for killing. Why do you know all that? He told me when he offered me this job. I see. One more thing... Shall we go? It's getting too warm. I have used this place for my own jobs as well. Since, Mr. Azuma and I have a history. Then, what was that job interview for? It was just an act because you were there. He even told me to write a resume. So, how did Mr. Kodera end up working here? Same as you? Could be. That's not true. Thank you. He wanted to quit killing when he came here. He just wanted to be a normal staff. At the same time, I was considering closing down. - It's good. - You were going to close? Not as a bathhouse. Only closing as a killing space. I see. I still want to stop. But I'm in debt. That keeps me from closing it. Drink it before it gets warm. Okay. The guy he owes is Tanaka, and Mr. Azuma can't pay him back, that's why he can't reject Tanaka's jobs. Have you met the guy called Tanaka? I have, a couple of times. Okay. - Mr. Tanaka is... - Hey. Drop Mr. Just say Tanaka. Is Tanaka a yakuza? Yes, he is. There's a lot of them, huh? I'm not going to open today. So, see you tomorrow. - See you. - See you. I can fall asleep in three seconds. Well, see you later. See you. I knew it. It's you, Matsumoto. I'm sorry for what happened to Kodera. You should've told me you were there. I'm just a normal bathhouse staff. There are still lots of assignments left. What a coincidence! I'm giving you a ride. The bathhouse job seems busy. Yes, it is. Don't tire yourself too much. Okay. How about you, dad? How's your work? How's my work? How is it going? Busy? Of course any job is busy. But currently it's not so busy. Last month it was, and it isn't now. But the month after the next may be busy again. I meant that a job itself is supposed to be busy. - Oh, is that what you meant? - Yeah. This is very good. Is it? I'm glad. You can eat it tomorrow, because I made too much again. That's okay. I love your cooking. Mr. Azuma. Is Matsumoto off today? Is he...? Yes. But Mr. Tanaka... Tanaka knows that Mr. Kodera is already dead? And now he knows Matsumoto is here. Did he go by himself? Of course he did. Are you sure he's okay!? Why? Are you going to help him? Well... Don't worry. He is a pro. I'm sorry! I won't do it again! Kazuhiko? Kazuhiko! Let's clean this up. Okay. I’ll try not to make a mess so that we can clean up easier. Okay. Appreciate it. You're welcome. Why did he have to be killed? What? Tanaka ordered you to kill him, right? Yes. Why did Tanaka want him to be dead? I don't know. Is that so. It's my job. I'll prepare the kiln. Okay. Are you alright? I'm fine. Okay. You guys kill people without knowing the reasons. It's just business. Is he also a yakuza? No, he's not. But, Kazuhiko, people who commit crime are not necessarily yakuza. I know. You do? You don't seem okay. What happened? I'm fine. Am I boring? What? That's not true. I'm having fun. Another drink? I think I'll have a break. - You want some tea? - Sure. - Excuse me. Can we get some tea? - Thanks. I got a text from Tamura today. In the group text? No. Just to me. About what? It said let's go have dinner. What are you going to do? Of course I'm not going. Why did he even ask you that? I wonder why. That's cold! Yours is just warm. No! Your hand is cold! Can I go to your place tonight? Tonight? Yes, you can. Angela. Go take a bath. - Take a bath? Now? - Yes. Please use the towels. There's enough. There's another employee here, right? He's just a... There is. He's just a normal boy and only does bath jobs. - He doesn't know about the killings? - No, he doesn't. Mr. Azuma. I know you're lying to me. I did research before I came here. I know he cleans up. He went to Tokyo University, right? Seems like it. What can he do? What do you mean? You hired him because he can do something! No. I hired him just for bath jobs, originally. - That doesn't make sense. - Why not? Why would a Tokyo University graduate want to work at a bathhouse? I actually had the same question. Alright then. It's a shame, Kodera is dead now. In exchange, hand over Matsumoto. - I understand. - Matsumoto. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. I was hired to do this kind of thing. It's good that you understand quickly. One more thing. What is it? The other guy. He knows about the job. Make him useful like Matsumoto or kill him. Your choice. Just letting him clean up is too risky to me. But... Use him or kill him. Two choices. - That's all. - Mr. Tanaka. - What? - Angela is still in the bath. I'm going now. Give her a ride. Of course. Here you go. Oh, sorry. We're here. You're really kind. Not really. Thanks again. Drive safe. What's wrong? Good morning. Good morning. How do you know where I live? What is it? I hate to tell you this, but... I wonder how you're taking this seriously. What do you mean? I've experienced some dangerous situations. Bringing and killing a guy isn't that easy. Of course I know that. What are you telling me? You will have to do the same thing. Same thing? I mean... Outside jobs, the same thing I do. Kidnapping and killing people? That's just what I said! Don't get mad. You were with a girl last night, right? What? She's your high school classmate, isn't she? What the fuck is this! Don't you get it!? What's wrong? You have no idea how dangerous the situation is! You still live with your family and even made a new girlfriend. It's too risky! You're not taking it serious! These are your weaknesses and can be easily used against you. Do you understand!? I guess you don't. Say something. Well... I think I should quit. Do you think you can quit now? Use your brain. You're from Tokyo University, aren't you? Education doesn't matter now. If you want to quit, there's a way. Is that...? Yes. - Kill myself? - No. Kill Tanaka. Kill Tanaka? Yes. If he's dead, that place can be a normal bathhouse. Kill Tanaka. Okay. Let's do this. How could you agree so easily? I know you think that I'll be doing everything. To begin with, break up with her. What? If you want her safe, leave her today. - Today? - Today. Today? Kill Tanaka? You two? Yes. You and... Kazuhiko? Yes. Tomorrow. Yes. Kazuhiko is prepared. Yes. I am. Are you sure? Yes. Pick it up. Scared? I'm good. I'm good. I'll give it to you. I'm good. You might need that in the future. Okay. I'll teach you how to use that later. Okay. - Can I ask you a question? - What? Why haven't you ever tried to kill Tanaka before? You’re so quick to approve of our plan, which makes me wonder why you haven’t done it yet. Kazuhiko, if it were that simple, he would've done it 200 years ago. There are reasons why he can't do it. Oh, I see. - No. - What? I can't take it anymore. But I can't kill him, and asking you to kill him is... you know? You've taken jobs from Tanaka, right? Killing him means you can lose your job. So... I want him dead as soon as possible, to be honest. You should've told me that earlier. - 200 years earlier. - Shut up. Kazuhiko. You should break up with your girlfriend. Moving out of your house now may be difficult, but you're better off alone. I told him that already. - Did you know that too? - Yes. - Keep her out of trouble. - I know! Okay. I'll go see her. I'll be waiting. Kazuhiko. Kazuhiko. Sorry. It's late. - Come inside. It's cold. - No. Here is fine. - I mean I'm cold. - Sorry. What is it? What's wrong? Well... You want to break up. That's not true. I don't want to. You don't want to, but? There are some reasons, and... Okay. Let's break up. Sorry. No. Stop. Don't do that. - Just one last time... - Don't do that! Let's make it simple. Okay. Good bye. Take care of yourself. Okay. Are you crying? What? I'm not. That's good. If you're tired, have some rest. I'm fine. Where's Mr. Azuma? He left after he gave me this note. What's that? Tanaka's house layout. Shall we? When do you get used to it? I don't know. - You know. - What? I never thought that you don't drink alchohol. People like me don't drink, in general. It's like drunk driving. I don't think there's any person in Japan who can aim precisely after drinking. Do you have any hobbies? Hobbies? None. How about a girlfriend? No. In your whole life? Nope. Oh, that means you're a virgin. So what? You're a virgin. I thought you were smarter. Don't get angry. I was just wondering what's fun in your life. Okay, let me ask you. You can't live if there's nothing fun? Obviously it's better if there is fun. I don't think so. The same again, please. Will you be okay tomorrow? Sorry, cancel it. Can I have tea, please? - I have a question. - What? People must've asked you this a million times, but... You graduated from Tokyo University, then why are you doing this? I checked your background. You've never had a full time job. Only part time jobs. And you're not chasing a dream like a musician. What? Let me ask you this. A Tokyo University graduate has to work at a big company and become happy? Good point. I do want to be happy, though. That was funny. I do want to be happy, though. Thanks for the dinner. No. You only drank oolong tea. See you tomorrow, 1 pm. Okay. Good night. Good night. Good morning. Good morning. You didn't sleep well? No. Shall we go? Yes. Here? Don't be stupid. I never park in front of his house. It's a few blocks away. Okay. Are you alright? Yes. I'm good. It's Matsumoto. Did you open the window? The place we discussed. Thank you. Bye. - Was it Mr. Azuma? - Yes. He's having a talk with Tanaka there. Okay. Well... - Let's go. - Wait. Just stay in the car. - Why is that? - I'll go alone. I mean... No offense, but it'll be easier without you. - But yesterday you said... - That was like... I just wanted to make sure if you were really determined, if you can keep secrets, or if you wouldn't betray me. - I would never do that. - There are many who would do that, in this world. I didn't know that. So, wait for me here. Okay. Take this. Test. You can hear my voice and sound around me. If something happened, run. What do you mean something ? In case I die, for example. Okay. You can turn it on with this button. Matsumoto. Be careful. I will. Mr. Azuma? Matsumoto. Mr. Azuma? Matsumoto, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...! What's the matter with you, Mr. Azuma? It's too much, Mr. Azuma. It's just ketchup. Matsumoto. It's harder than you think to deal with changes for the elderly like us. Mr. Azuma is comfortable with how it works. Just following my orders. I don't expect you to understand, young man. You should've told me so. He was scared of people like you, people who try to make changes. I don't understand. I don't understand! I found him weird today and asked him why. It was very easy to change his mind. He said he was scared of you. Sorry about that. Where is the other guy? You're with him, aren't you? That's fine. Anyway... You don't want to belong to me that much. That's fucking sad! Matsumoto! What's going on? Angela, go downstairs. What the hell are you doing!? What is that? Did you shoot him? When did you two...? Angela! Have you been cheating on me? Kazuhiko. I shot him...! You shot Matsumoto, Mr. Azuma. No, I was just... Matsumoto! Come on! - Hey, excuse me! - What! Which is the accelerator? Which pedal is the accelerator!? How would I know!? Shit! The card has not been inserted. What the hell are you doing!? I know! I know! How does this thing work!? I'm working on it! Matsumoto! Hang in there! It's too slow! He's going to die! I know! Just shut up! Mom! I'm home! I need your help! Who is he!? What happened!? I'll explain it later! Bring him in here! Lay him down here! Did you call an ambulance? I can't do that! Just hurry up! Why not!? He got shot! What should we do? Oh, a foreigner? Mom! Please! This is going to hurt. Bear with me. Did you say you're from the Philippines? Hot-to? You shouldn't be up yet. Go back to bed. I'm fine. Do you want something to eat? Yes. Take a seat here. - Are you sure you're alright? - Yes. Are you okay? Yes. Hello. Thank you for letting me stay. Are you sure that you don't have to go to hospital? Yes, I'm good. Thank you. - I'm making udon, okay? - Yes, thank you. I didn't know that the bathhouse job can be so dangerous. Yes, I'm sorry. No no, please make yourself at home. You too, Angela. Kazuhiko. What? What are we going to do with the bathhouse? I don't know. Should it be open? Hey, you get some rest. Sorry. Your family is... ... warm. What? It was the best udon in my whole life. Is that so. - Sorry for being late. - No worries. Long time no see. I was surprised when I got your message. - Sorry, it's all of a sudden. - No problem. Why didn't you come to the reunion party? Everyone was there having fun. Actually, I was there. You're joking. Then why didn't you talk to me? Isn't that a bit cold? Well, what can I do for you? - Wait, would you like something to drink? - Sure. Hey! What would you like? - Beer? - Sure. Two beer. Thanks. So, what? It was reported on the news. What was this? The owner of a bathhouse called Matsuno-yu was killed. Oh, I've heard about it. Then what? That's where I work. What? You do? I'm so sorry. Sorry for interrupting. - Thank you. - Draft beer. - How's your work? - Not bad. Good job. Let's start with a toast. Cheers. So good. So? Yeah, I want to keep running the bathhouse. Who? You? Yes. Okay. But I don't know anything about management, so I thought I'd ask some advice from you. I see. Totally fine. You can ask me anything. Thank you. By the way... Are you dating Yuri? I was, but we broke up recently. Okay. I see. Why? Nothing. The other day, I asked her out and she said no. And a girl told me that... ... I think that was Ayano... ... she saw you and Yuri together. Okay. So, you guys broke up, huh? Anyway, you should've gone to the reunion party. Oh, yeah. You went. Right. So, the bathhouse. What is it going to be like? Are you going to become the new owner? No. I'd rather be... What? It's been a while. It's been a while. I heard that Tamura has become the new owner of this place. Yes. I'm just an employed manager. I know. There's one thing I want to confess. What? After I graduated from university, I've never worked at any major company, nor I never succeeded in any business, but I made you think like I did. Sorry. Okay. Then I'm going to tell you my secret. Your secret? The reason why I come here. It's not that I prefer a spacious bath. What do you mean? I come here when the gas or water stops. I forget to pay the bills. Regularly? Gas and water and electricity... ... you can't really take a bath if one stops. That's crazy. So is your secret. What about today? The gas has stopped, so it's just cold water. Why don't you take a bath here then? Sure. - Cheers! - Cheers! Matsumoto doesn't usually drink. He never does. There are some moments in your life in which you wish it could last forever. Everything is perfect, happy, and you feel like you're born to live the moment. Those kind of moments. Rare moments. And I believe that we actually keep living only for those moments. Just for those few moments. I think that's good enough. I truly believe that's good enough.
