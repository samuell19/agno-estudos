'Then you realise you're this little cog in a machine. 'A cog that works 40 to 50 hours a week for 40 to 50 years, 'and for what?' Thanks. I know we've only just met, but it feels comfortable. - Does that sound stupid? - I know what you mean. You meet someone and you just click. - I can't believe he's doing it. - He's doing it all right. What kind of guy bets he can pick up the first girl to walk in here? That kind of guy, right over there. ...cos I feel like I've know you for ages. And, ah... I... No, I'm sorry, I can't do this. - Can't do what? - This is gonna sound terrible. See the three sitting behind me? Two guys and a girl? The ones spying on us? That's them. We all work in the area. Most nights, before and after shifts, we sit around, drink coffee, pass the time. And tonight, they saw you come in, Wendy, and sit down by yourself... - What time are you due back? - Half an hour. - Have you spoken to her yet? - To who? - Sean! - You two! Shh! I'm trying to learn something here. What is it? They bet me I couldn't sit down here and pick you up within 10 minutes. They did what? - Oh, looks like he's blown it. - Maybe she's actually got taste. - You expect me to listen... - No. I'm just sorry I came over. You didn't deserve this. For what it's worth, I meant what I said about you and me. It's my own stupid fault for blowing it. You're a nice-looking girl, I mean, you are... wow! Wait... This is going to sound stupid. I was sort of pleased when you sat down. - Really? - Yeah. Before I found out why. - It sounds stupid, doesn't it? - No. That doesn't sound stupid at all. Um... Listen, I have got to go, but can I take your number? - I don't normally... - What's going on? Looks like we're about to find out. Well? Vincent! God! How annoying can you be?! I'm dying here. What happened? - I haven't finished with that. - I have. That's very mature, Vincent.

'What colour clothes does she wear?' - Girls' clothes. - What colour underwear? What's that got to do with anything? Just trying to establish the facts, ratings wise. Figure, face, personality. Give her marks out of 10. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Forget it. What I mean is, if you saw her sitting by herself in a bar, would you go chat her up? She's my girlfriend, of course I would. - Lenny? - Yeah, hold on. Yeah, sorry, what is it? Would you say I'm... you know... You know... Can we start again? I think I got lost after the third word. ...useful? Useful? You know, attractive. I don't know. I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm just asking. All right. I mean, would you rate me? Jesus, Jody, I don't know. It will sort itself out. These things always do. You know how it works. No, I don't. What? You said I know how it works. I said I don't. I think anybody who moves in with his girlfriend is insane. Course, if you're married, it's probably unavoidable. Otherwise, it's just insane. All right, you're alone in your room and you want to have, you know, fun for one. What?! Oh, shit! You know, a personal touch. A one-man band. - I don't believe you're asking this. - Grow up, Lenny. Would you ever consider doing it about a girl... for example, like me? - Gee... Jody... - Just answer the question. No! I mean, probably not. - Why not? - Jody, please! - Lenny! - I don't know. You're a friend, it would be rude and you're not my type. Not your type? What's wrong with me? - That's it... - Sean, if that's a bar of soap, there's going to be trouble. - Hey. - Hey. - Are you ok? - Yeah. It's just this machine keeps eating my money. Oh, yeah. You're not meant to put money in it. - Oh. - You have to give it the Fonz. Thanks. Oh, that's the other thing. I wouldn't drink the coffee. Yeah. I really didn't mean to end up working here. I'd always planned to be an astronaut or a racing car driver. - Typical boy. - Mmm. I never had hospital porter down on the list, but it pays ok and I'm pretty much left to my own devices. And, um... a hospital at night... feels kind of creepy, don't you think? Yeah. So what about you? What are you doing hanging around here? Sean, you know what I feel like doing? Not having that conversation where two people bore each other with their life stories. Didn't realise I was boring you. No you weren't, it's just... Guy works nights in hospital... I think I can fill in the blanks. 'Wait, what are we talking about?' - 'Susie.' - 'Not your girlfriend.' 'No, a girl called Susie at the hospital' - I'm drawing a blank. - Do you ever listen to anyone? Sean, that hurts. I listen. If I don't take in all the details it's because I'm a non-judgemental listener. - A non-judgemental listener? - An ear you can trust. So, I ask her what she's doing hanging around the hospital, she changes the subject. Don't you think that's weird? My last three girlfriends have said they're into modern jazz. That's weird, this is just a guy with too much time on his hands playing Colombo, there's a difference. - I'm getting another coffee. - Like you need any more coffee. - Sean... - I think you're very attractive. No, Sean, check your watch. Uh-huh. Go now, get your train, she'll be there, you'll sort this out. She might not be there. Sean, you know I'm right, I'm always right. Ok, thanks.

Directory, Lenny speaking, which name? Thank you. Hi, there, it's... Oh, you recognise the voice? I just don't understand. I'm sorry. But you knew this when we started. - "I'm a big girl, it's ok." - I thought it'd be different. Look, this was supposed to be fun, ok? Let's fool around, it will be fun. And it was fun. It's like a game, right? - Right? - I suppose. Like any game there are rules, babe, and one of the rules was we could only do this three times. Three strikes and you're out. - I thought you were joking. - I don't joke about this. Vincent! Don't make me out to be a bastard over this. If I sound harsh, it's cos I'm being honest. I'd expect you to appreciate that. Maybe I'd better just go. Now, don't be like that. Come on, come back to bed. We can watch TV or something. I just got cable, you ever seen the home shopping channel? - No. - You gotta see it. It's like the last refuge of civilisation. You gotta see some of the crap these people are selling. Come on, you. Just because this is the last time we're going to be together, doesn't mean we have to part on bad terms, does it? No, I suppose not. 'And that is impressive 'considering that it comes with the chain, too.' - Want a cigarette? - I don't smoke. Oh. That's good. You know that thing? When you see some couple in the street having a drunken argument? She's yelling at him because he never does anything for her. Never makes any big romantic gestures. Oh, yeah. I love watching them. Right, well, that was the argument we had. I said some things that I regret. She said some things she should definitely regret - and it snowballed from there. - That was weeks ago. It started out, I was just avoiding her, that turned into habit and now, I'm getting this feeling... Sean, you want a simple solution? 'Hardware store. Big pot of paint, paintbrush.' 'Go paint on the bedroom wall in big fuck off letters '"Do you still live here?"' You come home, she's standing there throwing a hissy fit about the state of the wallpaper, then I think you've got your answer. I don't know, we just redecorated. - Sean... - Ok, look. What if I did that and it turns out that it is over? That's what I'm really scared of. That sounds like... what's that guy thing called? - The fear? - Yeah. The fear. I've worked in jobs like these for years. I've devised so many ways to make the clock go faster. First, try doing the job in record time. - That sounds like fun. - Then seeing how slow I could go. Then marking off the quarter-hours, then dividing them up into five-minute segments. - But you can't beat the clock. - Now I feel much better. Don't think about it or you'll see the big picture and that's not pretty. Then you realise you're this little cog in a machine that works 40 to 50 hours a week, for 40 to 50 years and for what? So you can spend your latter years in an easy chair pissing yourself... Joe, much as I love you, that's depressing. I'll put it another way. What, for example, are you gonna do when your looks go? It's never going to happen. This face defies surgery. Besides, I've got this. Vinny, lovers leave, parties end, bad jobs go on forever. Seriously, what you gonna do with the rest of your life? Big question. Let's see, save up some money, pay off my debts, leave this mickey-mouse job for dust. That's probably top of my List. And then what? Then I'll get a better job, move into a nicer flat, continue dating girls with severe emotional problems. And then what? - Then... - Uh-huh? I preferred it when you were rambling on about being a cog in a machine. I wasn't listening to half of it, but at least it didn't concern me. Oh, come on, Joe, give me a break. Just think about it. I do a mind-numbing job so I don't have to think. Hence, mind-numbing. - Susie. - Sean. What are you doing? Snooping around? No! Well, yeah. Um... Sean, meet David. David, meet Sean. David... Yeah, he's my boyfriend. Aren't you going to shake his hand? Sean, I was joking. 'I don't know how long I can last.' 'What's to know? You take calls, give out numbers. 'Soon, they'll train monkeys to do it and you'll need a new job.' 'I mean, say last night, I'm sitting at my terminal 'looking at the guy across from me. I've been there nearly two years 'and this guy sits across from me six nights a week 'and I realise I don't know his name, 'where he's from, anything. 'And I look around the place 'and I know maybe four, five people's names at a push. This is meant to be the heart of the communications industry. 'Two years and I can't even name half the people I work with.' - Fuck 'em. - What?! Who wants to know the names of a bunch of wingdings? These people spend their time giving numbers to the public. They're fucking telephone operators. - Why know their names? - But I'm a telephone operator. Look, maybe I'm not the best person to confide in. But you're looking at it all wrong. It's just a job. You plug in, switch off, get the fuck out and wait for pay day. - That wasn't really what... - You need a decent hobby, an interest outside of work to help those shifts fly by. - Like what you have? - That's right, like I have. And then... boom! Three strikes and they're out, then I get myself a new hobby. Like I say, you need to get yourself a decent hobby. - I can't do that. - Why not? - Can you keep a secret? - This is me you're talking to. Things had been on the slide between us for months, really. I was just about to finish it with him. 'I even had the whole strategy worked out, 'the whole "It's not you, it's me" routine.' - 'It's a good routine.' - 'Yeah, yeah, it is.' They rushed him to hospital, but it was too late. He'd already slipped into a coma. - Shit, that's terrible. - You're telling me. I couldn't do it then, I'd have been the bitch of the year. The thing is, I'd only been going out with him six months. He's been in a fucking coma for longer than that. I've got porno reactions. - You got what? - Porno reactions. - Porno reactions?! - Jesus, Vincent, keep it down! - What the hell are they? - I knew this was a bad idea. Lenny. Before I worked in the call centre, I had a job for two or three years writing for Men Only. - Writing for what? - Men Only, the jazz mag. I'm well aware what Men Only is. You wrote for it?! - Fuck, yeah. - Fuck me. You know the kind of thing. "Dear Men Only, I never thought I'd write to your magazine "but something happened to me last week I just had to share. "I'm an attractive blonde, aged 19. Small, but perfectly formed "with a bust that can only be described as a handful. "I work in a local salon and often flirt with the customers "but none really caught my eye until I saw... Peter - "a regular who'd just returned from work abroad. "With his rippling muscles, suntan and sexy smile, "I could hardly resist when he... "Continued page 64," etc, etc, etc. I spent so long writing that shit that now I've got porno reactions to everything. And how do they manifest themselves? It's not funny. Every girl I meet, every girl I half like, my mind goes click. Starts imagining them in some X-rated skin flick. - Every girl? - Yeah. Automatically. It's a fucking curse. It's not a fucking curse. It's a gift. Vincent... Don't you tell a soul. So tell me about your girlfriend. How do you know I've got a girlfriend? Sean, it's written all over your face. - Trust me. - Not much to tell, really. 'Wait, you actually examine the soap?' Yeah, to see if it's... you know, getting smaller. See if she still actually lives with me. Sean, that's really sad. And I mean that in the cruellest sense of the word. Thanks. No, I mean it. You should just take the night off work and find out. Believe me, I know. It's just with everything in a state of limbo you get used to it - and this is fucking sad - but it's almost comforting, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, I'd better get going. I have got a job to do. - Some job! - Yeah. Hi. - Hi. - Can I ask you a question? Let me guess. What's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this? No. A nice girl like you doing in a place like this? - It's a long story. - Give me the short version then. All right. I was out with some friends. I wasn't really enjoying it, and I couldn't face going home. So you came here? - I thought I'd drown my sorrows. - In hot chocolate? You wouldn't understand. It's a girl thing. I've got to admit, the whole thing is very weird, in a weird sort of way. Wait, let me get this right, you saw this documentary on TV about this university in Philadelphia where they have a code of conduct regarding boys and girls and at each stage of the date, they have to ask permission to do things, right? Yeah. Give me an example. Ok... Let's say it's you and me, walking through the snowbound streets of Philadelphia and I look over to you and I think "Wow, this girl is nice." Nice? You don't like nice? Well, seeing as the streets of Philadelphia were all snowbound... I was hoping for something a wee bit more imaginative. Ok, um... This girl is great, and I think I'd like to hold her hand, so... I'd have to ask you, "Is it ok to hold your hand?" You'd say yes or no. 'So, we walk on for a bit, I'm looking over, 'thinking, I'd like to kiss this girl. 'So, I'd have to ask you, "Is it ok to kiss you?" And you'd say yes or no again. 'How long does this go on?' 'All the way home - kissing, caressing, undressing...' Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How much have I had to drink by that point? As long as you can still write your name, I'd be ok, cos if we were to go ahead, go all the way, you'd have to sign a contract of consent, especially drawn up by the university itself. A contract? What else do we need? A lawyer present? If you like that kind of thing. That's stupid. One of the nicest parts of romance is, you know, not knowing what's coming next. The moment before the kiss... - What's your full name? - Huh? Madeline. Madeline Zozzocolovich. Is that one Z or two? Three. Vincent. Your name is Vincent. That's right. Hey, sleeping beauty. - Oh, shit, I missed the ending. - What ending? Vincent was firing into some girl, looked odds on to hit the target. - That's always something to see. - Yeah, you really missed out. - You all right? - Yeah. No, not really. What's up? It's a long story. Maybe another time. Do you want to get out of here? Go for a drive or something? I'm just going to freshen up. Sure. Ever get the feeling we're missing out on something? Yeah, all the time. Don't touch that dial! ♪ I don't know if I can face it again... ♪ What the fuck? ♪ Can't stop now, I've travelled so... ♪ It's the fucking car, the radio gets stuck on some fucking '80s revival station. - Switch it off. - It doesn't switch off. ♪ I wanna know what love is ♪ I want you to show me ♪ I wanna feel what love is... ♪ This is... I want you to know that I don't normally do this sort of thing. I remember when I was 13. I went with this girl in my class to the school disco. Sat and watched her dance with her friends until the lights went up. I'm sick of it, you know? - The fear. - Oh, yeah, the fear. Still, if it's over, it's over. Fuck, for all I know it could be over between me and my girlfriend for weeks now. - It's very weird, you know? - What? You always refer to her as "her” or "my girlfriend". - Parents not give her a name? - Yeah. - Madeline. - It's a cool name. Yeah? You should hear her surname. Oh, shit. Shit! You don't get it, do you? We're not friends. Don't look at me like that. I'm just trying to explain. We're acquaintances, not friends. - I, for one, am crushed. - I don't think that's true. We spend most nights of the week hanging out here talking crap, you know? That's what friends are for. Here's the litmus test. Three questions. Number one, what's my surname? Ok, two, where do I work? Um... something to do with children, right? And three, what's my favourite colour? - Beige? - No, green. I remember cos we had that argument. - Definitely green. - One out of three, magnificent. So we don't pay attention to details. No, we're not really friends. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy sitting here, passing the time, talking. But it's out of convenience rather than anything deeper. - I still think we're friends. - It's not a personal thing. How is friendship not personal, Jody? Lenny, I need a favour. - What favour? - Car favour, right now. - I just got here. - I know, but it's important. - Lenny, very important. - Let me just say hello to Sean. - No, we have to go now. - What?! Come on. How long was I away for? Vincent, what's going on? Vincent? It's, ah... It's about Sean. What do you mean? It's the way he treats me, you know. Do I have "second-class citizen” stamped on my forehead? He's just like that. You're a girl, he's Vincent. It pisses me off no end. He and Lenny always running around doing shit. It makes me feel like a wee girl stamping her feet on the ground while the boys play in the tree house. You wanna play in Vincent and Lenny's tree house? No. It would just be nice to be invited up occasionally. 'Remember when that girl came into the cafe?' I was going through some of the old tried and tested routines. Thought I'd have to come up with something new as she was Dutch. ♪ I wanna feel what love is ♪ I know you can show me... ♪ - Is everything ok? - Yeah. Everything's fine. You serious? You slept with Sean's girlfriend, Madeline? Yeah, Madeline. Jesus, Vincent, that's off the scale. Do you know how many girls I've fucked this year? That's off the scale. - That was a shitty thing to do. - I know. I didn't even want to do it, but it was all out of my hands. - Out of your hands? - Figuratively speaking. It was the little guys downstairs - millions of them swimming about looking for an exit. They should rewrite the biology books cos when it comes to the brain versus the little guys, always bet on the little guys. Is that what you'll tell Sean? - I'm not going to tell him. - You've got to. - Why should I? - He's your friend. Like Jody says, we're acquaintances, not friends. That's shit. She says that to kid on she's better than us. Do you wanna know something, about you? I don't know. You come to me, right, cos you fucked Sean's girlfriend. That sounds as if you're racked with guilt. You want me to set your mind at rest cos you've fucked over a friend. For a while, it almost seemed funny - living together and never seeing her. - But now... - Not funny? - You know how it is. - No. It's little things - waking up next to her. - The way her hair looks. - Her hair? At the cinema, we hold hands throughout the movie. There's always someone behind with an annoying laugh. Ask for a refund. Yeah, well anyway, I've decided that tonight I'm going to do it. I'm going to get someone to punch out my timecard for me, go home, see Madeline and tell her how I feel. About her hair? I've been really stupid. I didn't realise how much I missed her until... Well, until... Wait, I can see where this is heading. If it's a typical guy thing, you were either drunk and a song reminded you of her or you had your dick in someone else. Sean. It was the dick thing. Really? Shit! I was only joking. I just thought it was a smart thing to say. With everything in a state of limbo, you get used to it. It's almost - and this is fucking sad - it's almost comforting, you know what I mean? Yeah. Well, better get back to it. I have got a job to do. - Some job! - Yeah. Sean... you know the nice thing about being in limbo? You can do anything you want. Vincent, I can't believe you did that. - Sean. - What? You just called me Vincent. - You won't turn into him, will you? - No, I won't turn into Vincent. I'm going to sort everything out. Hey, Lenny, you actually wrote for this magazine? Yeah, about two years ago. I used to love these letters, gave me situations to aspire to. I'm not easily impressed, but I gotta say, I'm impressed. Ooh! Vincent, how can I put this? About a month ago, this new girl starts at work. The other evening shift... - Hello. - Yeah, hello. She's something else, too, you know? When I see her, I can't eat, I can't sleep... Sounds like the real thing. What can I do? I've got porno reactions, for Christ's sake. 'I can't talk to her when I'm face to face... well, with her face. 'So I do something stupid. 'I start phoning her on my breaks, 'pretend I'm a high-flying businessman.' I'm just back from Hong Kong. 'Chatting away, you know.' You're calling her under an assumed name? That's stalking, surely. It's not stalking. You've seen the film Cyrano de Bergerac? No. Well, the point is, over the phone, we click. Really click - laughing, joking, she even says she's looking forward to me calling. - This is all very touching. - Wait. It gets worse. 'The other night, I bit the bullet. 'I asked her out, over the phone.' - What did she say? - She said yes. It was a bit nerve-racking, but she said yes... tonight. Tonight? Let me get this straight. She's expecting a jet-setting businessman to show up, instead she'll get mild-mannered Lenny, the stalker. - I know, I know. - Jesus, Lenny. How will she react to your deception? I don't know, but you deceive women all the time. Yeah, the proper way, behind their backs. - This way lies insanity and ruin. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. It's simple, don't show up. Don't do anything. Don't ever call her again, just walk away, walk away from it. Why is it locked? Fuck knows. It's a security thing. What, to keep people out, or people like you in? Listen, Lenny, remember what I said, just walk away. Fuck it. Susie? 'You look really nice. I just love a man in uniform.' - Seriously? - Yeah. You poor bastard. By the way, your boyfriend's back. ♪ Out last night ♪ I have a bar outside with a... ♪ - Vincent, why are you here? - How are you doing? I see you took my advice to not show up. Don't worry, she's been and gone. - What happened? - I just couldn't do it. She was there and I sat here like the useless fucking lump that I am, then she left. And I still sat here going over and over the sorry mess that passes for my life. You couldn't do it cos you build it up to something it isn't. When you build it up, you also build up the fear. It's no big deal, it's just talking. I don't really need this now. Yeah, you do. Otherwise you'll never learn. Look, I could pick any girl here, go up, hit on her and it would mean fuck all cos I don't build it up. I don't open the door, invite the fear in for a coffee. It means fuck all, because it is fuck all. Watch. Wait, Vincent, this really isn't necessary. Hi. You wanna hear something strange? I think so. I saw this thing on TV about Philadelphia, the University of Philadelphia. Apparently, they have this code... - Well, no... - Hold on. Do you know who I am? What? No. I just saw you sitting here alone, and... Oh, I get it. If it's all the same to you, I'm waiting for someone. - Been waiting long? - 10 minutes more, then I'm gone. So, this thing in Philadelphia, you got to hear it. Look, I don't want to be rude, but I'm waiting for someone. Boyfriend. No, it's a guy I speak to on the phone at work. Stupid, huh? Shit! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a shithead. Hmm. Huh. Lenny! Oi! Wait up! Hey! I didn't realise! I'm sorry. Would it have made such a difference? What are you talking about? Course it would. Have you spoken to Sean yet? That's a totally different issue. Yeah, right. Joe! What are you waiting for? Retirement? Fucking clock just moved backwards. I'm serious, Vinny. You're developing a very serious attitude problem. - Vinny. - In a minute. I got to move these palettes or Alec will kill us. - Vinny! - Keep watching the clock, Joe. Joe. Hey! Hey! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Shit! What are you gawking at? Call a fucking ambulance! Who's first aid? Who's first aid? There's meant to be a fucking first aid here. He's not breathing. Look after him. Where's the ambulance? Did you call the fucking ambulance? - Yeah, it's on it's way. - Fuck! - Not working again tonight? - No, not tonight. - How is he? - I don't know!

Who's got the fucking keys? - What the hell's going on? - Gimme the keys. I gave them to one of the grocery boys. Oh, fuck, Alec! Who's got the fucking door keys? Please! Who's got the keys? Shouldn't we cover his face? Uh-uh. Careful. We don't want to have another accident. Vincent, what are you doing here? Oh, you know, just hanging out. - Are you ok? - No. I'm not. This old guy I work with, Joe - he just had a heart attack. - He didn't make it. - Oh, shit. I'm sorry. - Did you know him well? - Yeah, pretty well. We don't really know anything about each other, do we? What?! Come on. I don't know the name of some guy you work with, so what? I bet you don't know the names of anyone here. Lenny doesn't know the names of anybody he works with. - Yeah, I suppose. - Vincent, we're friends. The rest... it's just details. Shit! Ever had one of those days when the clock doesn't go quick enough? All the time. You got somewhere important to go? Yeah. I've gotta find my girlfriend and tell her that I love her. Probably sounds pretty lame to you. No, not at all. Sean, there's something I've gotta tell you. You know you've got a great smile? You're just saying that. Doesn't mean it isn't true. What? I know it's a little off the scale. You're joking, right? This has to be a joke. I'm sorry. I didn't realise who she was until we'd gone too far. You knew who she was before you... - Fuck, that is fucking low. - I know. I can't believe this. I know it was wrong, I just want to make it up to you. How? Fly around the world the wrong way and turn back time so you can defuck my girlfriend? It wasn't just my fault. You were ignoring her. Fuck you! It wasn't my fault. I didn't even want to do it. It was the little guys downstairs, they're in the driver's seat! Sean! I'm sorry!

'Somebody phoned. They held on for a minute, then hung up. Lenny, you work in telecommunications. Do you recognise this dialling code? - Mm-mm. - No. Not many would. It's this horrible town in the middle of nowhere. The kind of place people generally avoid. A friend of Madeline's has an aunt there. - Madeline called? - I should have guessed. It's her kind of crisis centre. - What? - It's a girl thing. - A girl thing? - Yeah! I'm gonna go out there and find her. I'm coming, too. - What? - I'm coming, too. You need a car, you need a driver. I'm that guy. Well, I wasn't planning on bringing anyone, but... Ok. - That's it. I'm coming, too. - What? You really think I'm gonna let you go alone? - It's an accident waiting to happen. - Ok, bring the whole gang. Where is this place? It's, ah... lift up your cup, Lenny. It's there. Lenny, how can you be car sick? - It's your car. - I know. I'm fine in the city, it's just when I get out in the countryside. - Are you ok? - Kind of. My eyes are smarting a bit. - Mine, too. - Mine three. Must be the light or something. Lenny, don't be so square, switch the radio on. No, if it goes on, it doesn't go off. Not even when you switch the engine off? Jody, when you switch the engine off, it goes off. When you switch it back on, it's back on. - That's stupid. - I know it's stupid.

You got a nerve showing up. - I don't want us to fall out. - It's a bit late. Anything I can do, I'll do it. Anything. - There is something. - Name it. - Gimme your watch. - Eh? - You heard me. - Mate! It belonged to Errol Flynn, it doesn't work. - I know about the watch. - This watch... this watch... Between you and me, I think it's where I get my power. I thought it was the little guys downstairs. It's a unique combination. Vincent, just give me the watch. This watch really belonged to Errol Flynn, huh? I've even got a certificate of ownership that proves it. Aw! Not the fucking watch! - I think we're even now. - Even?! I only fucked your girlfriend! That was Errol Flynn's! Vincent, you really want me to hit you again? You hit like a girl anyway. Yeah?

I think I need to work out a new plan. - There was an old plan? - Yeah, there was a plan. The plan was come here, find Madeline, sort things out. Then what? Well, if the plan went according to plan, we'd go home together. - And then what? - And then bowling. We'd go bowling or something, do the fun things. Go on dates. And then what? Then I guess I'd get a day shift so I didn't feel as if I had permanent jet lag without ever going anywhere. Oh. Then what? - What is it with you? - What? I'm not disagreeing, but what else is there? Yeah, we can get mickey-mouse day jobs but for what? For nine to five, work in an office. Commute with everyone else to work. In bed by 11, up by seven. I just don't see the big pay-off. - Vincent. - You are in a bad mood. I'm being realistic. Can you say your life will be any better with a day shift? - Probably, if I still had a job. - What? - Say that again. - I got fired. - 'When?' - 'About two weeks ago.' - 'Why?' - 'It's a long story.' 'Tell the short version.' I hated my job and they said I was bringing everyone down. But you work on a conveyor belt. - I know! - Hang on. If you've been out of a job, how come you're still hanging around with us acquaintances? Because... Cos I've nothing better to do. That's the single most depressing thing I think I've ever heard. Thanks. Thank you. Look, I appreciate the support, but you really don't have to hang around here with me. - Why don't you go and have fun? - You can have fun here? - It was rhetorical. - Oh, ok. Come on, Lenny, let's go. - Hey, invite me. - What? - Invite me. - Sorry? Invite me, invite me, invite me, invite me, invite me! Ok. Jody, would you like to come with us? - Where are you going? - To play crazy golf. No, thank you. Jesus! What a depressing place! I can feel the life being sucked out of me. That was weird, wasn't it? It's about keeping your eye on the ball. It's a game for idiots. - No, I meant weird as in Jody. - Oh, yeah. But you can hardly blame her. We do kinda cut her out. - Almost makes me feel bad. - Really? I thought you didn't like Jody. Jody? I think she's fucking great! - You do? - Yeah. First time I met her, I tried to hit on her. No! Course she knocked me back straightaway. As far-fetched as that sounds. It's just as well, though. I think she's way too smart for me. - Well, you don't act like it. - Course I don't! Even though we're friends, she is a girl. Wait... You said friends. - Yeah? - So, everyone is friends? Of course we're friends. Look around. We're standing on a golf course, surrounded by King Kong and God knows what else in the middle of fucking nowhere. That's what friends are for. Gail, see those guys there? - Vincent, get back on the clock. - What is it? Whatever you do, don't look around. Shit! Shit! Aw... shit! - What is it? - Bad news, I looked. - Aw, shit! - They're coming over. This is not good. Is this good? As opposed to bad? No, it's not good. I can't do it. I can't face Gail. - What? That's Madeline. - Next to Gail, that's Madeline? Why would I worry about Gail? You're stalking her. - Madeline is the problem. - Shit! Why are they both here? Why are they coming over? What do they want? What are we going to do? We have to stay cool. I've been in tighter spots than this. Don't confess. Don't mention Sean at all. Don't even speak if you can help it. All right? Flowers. I should have bought her flowers. Flowers die. Well, chocolates, then. They're romantic, right? Chocolates make you fat. Well... What do I do? Be myself? - Just don't mention the tramp. - The tramp? Susie, the girl you shagged in the hospital. Oh, yeah. That'd be a bad idea, right? This is... Talk about a small world. Very small. I certainly didn't think I'd run into you again. Especially not here. But in a fucked up way, I'm glad I have, cos I wanted to talk about the other night. Yeah? Yeah. Look, I don't want this to sound cold, but... that was a mistake, a big mistake. You were just in the wrong place at the right time. I don't blame you for the problems with my boyfriend even though you are partly responsible. Don't go blaming me. What we did has nothing to do with Sean and you. - Sean? - Yeah, you can't blame me. I never said Sean. I said my boyfriend. No, I distinctly heard you say Sean. Lenny, back me up here. Thanks, really. How did you know that my boyfriend's name was Sean? Luck? You know... I was thinking... - While we're on the subject... - Uh-huh? I think it was a mistake bringing us. But you wanted to come. That was just so I could join in, but... What? You're here to save a relationship and you bring a serial dater, a guy with porno reactions and a know-it-all who pretends to work so she needn't stare into the black abyss of her life. I guess. You'd have done better with the tin man, the scarecrow and the lion. Well, you're helpful. And as for Vincent and Lenny... Only an idiot would let them out there unsupervised. Vincent, tell me this. How long have you known I'm Sean's girlfriend? I didn't know about you and Sean until just before we... The University of Phila... I do know you. He tried to pick me up. - Gail! - How do you know my name? Rewind a second. You knew about Sean and me before we ended up... I'm regretting it as I'm saying it - in bed together? Technically. But we're talking minutes. That sounds so much worse than it sounds. The cafe, the Philadelphia stuff, that was genuine. If it was genuine on her, then why did you use it on me? I said genuine, not original. You pay to see The Rolling Stones, you expect to hear the classics. Ok, then. I only tried to pick you up to help Lenny, so no harm there. Who's Lenny? And you work in the call centre, right? Night shift. I can't believe it, you call Sean your friend yet you still did it, even though you knew... And I'd like to know how you know my name. Is this some kind of sick game? This isn't something you can explain on a crazy golf course. - You're unbelievable! - How am I the bad guy? I didn't make anybody do anything they didn't want to. The main thing is Sean is here. - Sean is here? - Yeah, and the important... Sean's here. - I can't deal with this. - You can. - Sean's here. - I think she gets the message. No! I mean, Sean's here. Gail, what am I going to do? Just speak to him. You can do it. Right, I can do this. Oh, no, I can't do this! - What's she doing? - She's bad at confrontations. No, shit, Sherlock. Hi, can I get a coke, please? I just want to be with Madeline. - Sean. - Hey. - How's it going? - It's not. I can't talk, I must find her. Sean. Sean! - What? - It's Madeline... She's waiting for you at the pier. - Is she? - Yeah. How do you know? Sean, it's me, Jody. I know. What? You wouldn't happen to be Madeline, would you? Hey! That puts me in the lead. Gail, not that I care, but aren't you worried about Madeline? It's better not to get involved. She needs to sort this out herself. To be frank, I'm getting a little tired of it all. Blah, blah, Sean's avoiding me... Haven't seen him for weeks, blah, blah... Slept with Vincent, blah, blah... It was rubbish... Vincent was rubbish?! Well, I don't know if that were her exact words. I know that I should go talk to him, it's just... I did something so stupid, it'll ruin everything. - Madeline... - I don't want to split up. That's why I came here - to avoid him. You two make the perfect couple. Jesus, you're both so selfish! You think this just affects the two of you? Why? What do you mean? What about me? I have to put up with it every night. Sean going on and on and on about it. If you don't get out there right now and sort this out... - I can't face him. - Yes, you can. This isn't the playground. You're not five years old. And he loves you. He loves me? It's Sean, Inaction Man, and he's come all the way out here. You work it out. - Hey. - Hey. Is this about the wallpaper, then? Yeah. This is going to sound stupid, but... I'm really pleased to see you. Yeah, and I almost wish you weren't here cos... I've got something to tell you. I did something bad. Really bad. I slept with your friend, Vincent. Oh. - Oh? - Oh. Wow! I expected... I don't really know what I expected. But something a little more X-rated than just "Oh". - Oh. - Sean, if you say oh again... - I knew. - What? I knew. You knew. Oh, my God. And still you came out here. You poor thing. - Madeline, listen. - I'm the lowest of the low. - Madeline. - Lower even. - Madeline. - What? I did something bad. - Really bad. - What? What did you do? I don't believe this! For a minute there, when I saw you standing next to... King Kong, I was so pleased you came out here and I... and I thought maybe we had a chance. - But now... - We still have a chance. A chance? People in burning buildings have a chance. People in comas have a chance. Fucking we don't have a chance. You slept with someone else! - You slept with someone else. - It wasn't like that! It's Vincent, it's always like that. It wasn't like that. - I'm just going to freshen up. - Sure. ♪ I wanna know what love is ♪ I want you to show me ♪ I wanna feel what love is ♪ I know you can show me... ♪ 'I didn't do it because I wanted to. I did it because... 'I didn't know anything any more.' I didn't know whether I was pretty or ugly, or... what was happening with us. And now everything's ruined. Everything we've ever done, from our first date, moving in together, everything. We could have come out here, stood at the pier, shouted at each other, skipped the whole middle part. - I'll show you a trick. - Ok. This pound coin, I'll shove all the way through my body into that hand, ok? Ok. Up along there along the shoulders, down this arm - There you go. Yeah. - No! - Do it again. - Do it again? - It takes a lot out of me. - Do it again. Ok. Normal pound coins for this stunt. Let me see. No. - So how's it going? - It's weird. We're sitting there, just talking away like real people. - Any interesting side effects? - No, none at all. I actually... I actually asked her out, straight and simple. - You asked her out? Wow! - Yeah. - So what did she say? - Well, she said no. But I asked her. I'm proud of you, Lenny. Um... excuse me, have you lost something? Yeah, I have. I seem to have lost my phone number. I was wondering could I have yours? Are you taking the piss? - Did you see that? - Saw it and enjoyed it. If I wasn't so shallow, I might be having a crisis of confidence right now. Vincent. What? Just be glad you are such a shallow person. Yeah, thanks, Jody. 'You sure you wanna do this?' Sounds weird, but I just want some kind of... I don't know, some kind of memento. - Memento? - It's a girl thing, you know. Yeah, sure, getting your photos taken with your ex-boyfriend. Wow... ex-boyfriend. - Yeah, it does sound weird. - Oh, damn. We got three more. Yeah, right, we can do this. Madeline, if this is the end of the line for us, who's going to move out? - What? - Of the flat. - One of us will have to move. - I'm really fond of the flat. - So am I. - Sean! Damn it! I'm not moving out, end of story. I'm not moving out, end of story. - 'One of us has to.' - 'Not me.' 'It's not going to be me.' How do you think it's going? - Is that a serious question? - You two, shh! I'm trying to learn something here. 'Me? You're the one being unreasonable.' - 'We could always share.' - 'What?' 'I could sleep there days, you nights.' - Why don't we go back out then? - Fine, forget it. Just like the bad old days. Yeah. They weren't that bad. I think it's about to pop. I know.
