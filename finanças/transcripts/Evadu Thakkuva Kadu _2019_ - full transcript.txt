We shouldn't be suspected. Send these four members in different directions. GOA AJMER PUSHKAR This is Monda market. This is our world. Our day starts when the whole city sleeps. Being called as Kuli, Hamali, Bandoda and Bakkoda, we don't have any identity. This film is about the struggle between everyone's place in this world and the identity that needs to be hard earned. EVADU THAKKUVA KADU Alright, sister. Come, come. Tell me how much do I need to pay you. 27 sacks. RAJA: 22 sacks. 15 sacks. And it is a total of 85 sacks including mine. Do you guys just work in the whole night and sleep in the whole day? Idiot, you should also mind your future. As if we'll open a locker account in ICICI bank with the money you pay. Forget about the locker. You should consist of an ID for your account. ID? ID is a proof of oneself. - Oh. - Sister, pay us fast. I've some important work. What is that important work? He wants to buy 'Fair and lovely' it seems. - What? This guy? - Yeah. This face doesn't get fairness despite washing it with acid. They show fairness in five minutes on the television. Won't I get fairness till evening? This is our youth's matter. Yes. How will you know who is old? Am I old? What is that youth's matter that I am not aware of? Why are you disturbing my dream in the climax? "Kodi Baye Lacchamma song". What are they doing? Why are these colourful chicks coming into our market? Hey! Metro works are in progress on the main road. That is the reason these girls are going to the school in this way. Oh! So is that the reason this fatty, is standing here with his face full of powder? Hey Banda! Your girl is coming. Hey! Sit down... Sit down... - Hey! Sit down, everybody. - You idiot! - Oh God! He is doing too much. - Hey Raja! You girl has come. - Hey! Sit down. - Why are they changing their shirts? Why is he standing like a bird shocked with electric power? She isn't staring at all. Chinna, look at your girl. They are wearing the same t-shirt now. What more will they do in future? She is waving hand at him. How can a crane match a fox? Welcome Madhu. It's just you who is left. You are the only single guy in this gang. It is hard to fall for rich people. How will they fall for a poor people like us? Enough, stop it! Our Mandu babu blows smoke rings. The girl whom we see from that ring shall be Madhu's. - Is that okay? - Okay. - What kind of plan is this? - What is this? Hey come! - Blow it. - Okay, okay. Watch it. Hey! Hey! Hey Madhu! - Hey! - Shh! Guys! Look at our Madhu's girl. She looks like a dried Brinjal. Seems like a weak battery! - Goggles face! - Leave me. I don't want her. Don't tell us anything. We had a condition... that the girl we see from the smoke ring is yours. - Hey! - Hey, let's go! - I am Raja. - Hello. - He is Chinna. - Hello. - He is Banda. - Hello. - He is Madhu. - Hello. Hello. - Our Madhu is staring you for many days. - Let him. He isn't eating food properly since the day he saw you. - Is there any problem? - He is liking you so much. Excuse me! I don't like all these. Look! A single bud blossoms into a single flower. Single bud blossoms into a single flower? It is... The type of flower it reaps depends on the type of seed you sow. For example, jasmine flower reaps for a jasmine plant. Poorna sister, how will you know about the flowers when you don't wear it? However, this is a matter of our street youth. You don't know about it. As I am trying to tell you guys... will you make fun of me saying the matter doesn't belong to my age? - Take it. - Hey! If you won't return it till evening including the interest... Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey Linga! What happened? - They are dashing us. - Poor children! Leave them. - Go. - Thank God! Damn! What kind of vadas are they? - Have it or else get lost! - If not here I shall eat it somewhere else. - Damn! No one will come to such hotel. - Which idiot will I get today? There the idiot is. - Greetings brother! - Greetings! Why are you looking so upset? Brother, I don't have a job. Will anyone gets upset on not having the job? - Meanwhile, what did you study? - I failed in my tenth standard. - Did you fail in your tenth standard? - Yes. Though you aren't having the job? You should become upset if you aren't having a job despite clearing the exams. - I'm telling you, your job is confirmed. - Thanks, brother. - Alright, order a dosa for me. - Dosa. Hey fool! Order to him but not me. - One dosa please. - Okay. - Brother, what kind of job is it? - The job is in the railway department. - In the railway department? - Yes. - The salary is Rs. 25000/-. - Rs. 25000/-? - Yes. - Brother, what kind of job is it? - Are you aware of the railway's station? - Yes. - The train will arrive, right? - Yeah. - They will stop at the station, right? - Yes. - They will start after stopping, right? - Yeah. - If the power is off in the night... - Then? You should hold a lantern and show the way for the train by running. Brother, there might be snakes on the railway track. The government will provide you with shoes. Thanks, brother. From when should I... Hello, brother-in-law. It's me... You informed about a job in the railway department, right. Yes, that is the one. He is our guy and a nice guy too. Please fix it for him as he is in trouble. You shouldn't ignore my word... Hey! Get up. - What are you doing? - I'm taking your blessings. Hey! The public might misunderstand it. Well brother-in-law, give me a minute. Hey! Order a ginger tea for me and leave. Bring a ginger tea for brother. - Hey! Pay the bill and leave. - Okay, brother. - Practice running. - Even my money lenders cannot catch me. Such a fool! I managed so well despite zero balance. Isn't the stinky smell coming from him? Damn! It is stinky. - Huh! This is so bad. - Hey! How dare you to throw chutney on this Ulli Bhai? What did you say your name? - Ulli Bhai. - Ulli Bhai. It is him not me. Hey! What is this? Even I'm confused for the same. - Taste this chutney and tell me how is it? - Yuck! Is it stinky? Ouch! How dare you to make this Ulli Bhai lick that chutney? Hey you bald head! Don't you have shame to slap your fellow male? Slap my wife if you are dare enough. - Huh? - Slap her. Do you agree now? How dare you to slap my wife in front of me? Slap my respected mother-in-law if you are dare enough! It's my daily deed. - I'll brutally slap my mother-law. - Slap her then. As if I'm lenient towards your mother-in-law. - Am I dare enough now? - Oh my God! How dare you to slap my mother-in-law who is like my mother? Hey! Slap my lovely brother-in-law if you are daring enough! Am I dare enough now? - I'm Ulli Bhai. - Brother, you are very daring. Brother, you are a unique man. The count is perfect. Come, brother. Damn! Stay away from me. Thanks, brother. You are calling me daring after slapping women? Hell with this idiot in the morning! Hey, fool! How can you make him slap your wife who should be taken utmost care? She doesn't belong to one who cares. She belongs to the type of people who cares only money. This is fine but why did you make him slap your cute brother-in-law? If I haven't made him slap my brother-in-law, he'll tell everyone that someone has bashed my brother-in-law in the market. He will shut his mouth if I made him get slapped. Which is why I made him slap. - You are great, brother. - Thanks, brother. - Hey! Bring the luggage. - What? You want me to carry the luggage? Ulli Bhai... - No, son-in-law. We shall carry it. - Good. Cops' vehicle will arrive to us, if we bash our wives. But there will a change in your wife if you make someone bash her. Everyone please try it. My God! Everyone is beyond others. Brother, is it yesterday's chutney? It is spoiled. You are complaining about the food by coming in the afternoon. Hey Mallesh! How many times should I tell you... - not to give food to these boys? - Banda got what he deserved. Enough, let's go. None of the hotels in the market tastes good. Hey! Why is she coming this way? - Madhu, she might be coming for you. - Oh no! Hey! Look at her. - Hello. - Hello. Are you fine? Forget about it! From the day he has fallen in love with you, he is not sleeping and letting us sleep. He is shouting on asking anything to him. There is nothing wrong with what he did. - Whoa! - Is it so? Even I wasn't able to sleep in the night. Why? Proposing love to a girl after roaming around for many days, and if she doesn't accept it, it would be very devastating and I know how it feels. - Which is why... - So? Hey! Don't escape. But what do I do? Single bud blossoms into a single flower. Flower? I accepted Vikas's proposal last week. Vikas? We both would've been lovers if you've told me last week. Thank God! It is a sin to love both of them at a time, right? Yeah, it's a sin. We are friends now. Friendship is the best thing. Come on, shake hands with me. - Hello. - Hello. - Then what about our Madhu's love? - I have many friends. Select anyone from them. I'll help you with your love. Dude, we are succeeding in our plan. By the way, how did you select me? Girl in the ring just like the finger in the ring? Come on, dude! Oh, this girl? Her name is Chandini. Chandini! Awesome name, dude! I'll help you all but I have a small doubt. Your love is true, right? Because, can I stay silent when a fellow girl is getting injustice? Excuse me! We don't belong to such category. We too belong to 'single bud-single flower category' which you keep saying it all the time. Alright. I will help you for sure. Hey wait! If you can help me in my love matter too... Oh! There came a time where all the buds bear flowers. Yes... Yes... Okay. Then give me the details of your girl's whereabouts. My girl looks so beautiful just like Rambha and passes from this way. She stares at me and smiles while I think about her. What about your lover? My lover will be like Anushka in the film 'Sie zero'. Nice pair. You look at girls from there, right? Yes. - Oh no! - Why? What happened? Even I feel like laughing at that. Wouldn't other girls laugh? We cannot understand what you are saying. They aren't laughing at you but look at the 'Ali Bali' hoarding. Oh no! Shucks! We haven't minded this hoarding till now! Get lost. Get to the work of yours that is carrying the sacks. Hell with your love! My mother warned me not to trust girls. Your mother? Who is your mother? She used to tell me if she was there. The chairman of our market, Mr Rayudu who is the saviour of the poor merciful. He has arranged Collective weddings just like every year. - Give that to me. - Onto that he is presenting... sarees and mangalsutra with his blessings. What is it Inspector sir that you've come to the market so early? Nothing much, Mr. Rayudu. Last night, the foreigners over there have missed their suitcase it seems. Is it so? But it's one and only Bala who is a thief in this area? I got to know that he roams with your group of men. - That is the reason behind my arrival. - Oh! - Where is he? - He might be roaming here with our men. I'll asked him to come. There he is. Did you steal the suitcase? He had to pay his daughter's exam fee it seems. You should ask me and take the money if you are in need but you shouldn't steal it. Mr. Rayudu, it's just because of your presence in this market, that we are living peacefully. Hey! Return their suitcase. Madam, please wait in the police station. I'll come. - Mr. Rayudu, I'll leave now. - Alright. - Come. - Hey! Bring them all here. Hey Bala! Go and take care of that welfare. Inspector sir, you've asked for suitcase, right? You got it, right? Hey! You go. Hey! She is arriving... She is arriving... Hey! It's ringing. Take it... Take it... - Hello. - Hello. Who is it? I lost my mobile. Can you please tell me the address. I got it in the neighbour lane of Monda market. I came here to have my dinner in the morning. - Oh no! - I might've lost it somewhere. You had dinner in the morning? Madam, you seem like a gentleman. It's alright but what should I do with this mobile? Tell her that you'll collect it in the morning. I'll tell her. Can I meet you tomorrow and take my mobile? No, no. I have to go to school tomorrow. That's okay. Call me whenever you find free time. I have another mobile. That mobile was given by my mother. But now, I am left with phone but not my mother. I'll give you a number. Will you call me whenever you find free time? Okay. - Hey! Tell me your number. - She is speaking on my mobile. Hey! Tell me Poorna sister's number... Tell me... Yes, tell me. - 97... - 97... - 03... - 03... - 00... - 00... - 10... - 10... - 07... - 07... - What is your name? - My name is... - Don't tell her your name. - Don't tell her your name. - Tell her your name is Bunny. - Bunny. - What? - They call me as Bunny. Oh no! My father likes Bunny a lot and which is why he named me so. Now, there is Bunny but his father is no more. Hmm. Call me tomorrow and I'll come in a car and take my mobile. - Okay. - Okay... Okay... Oh my God! Why did you say that you had dinner in the morning? You should say breakfast instead. Poorna sister, we have come up with a good name for you. What is it? Daring Vijaya Shanthi. There's nothing wrong in me being the daring Vijaya Shanthi, when you act like Babu Mohan. Stop your crap and tell me the reason behind your arrival. Poorna sister, we want Rs. 4000/- as advance. What? What are you thinking of yourselves? Sister, we are asking our money but not yours. There is nothing much Poorna sister. You are aware of Banana Ghouse, right? He is leaving for Dubai and said that he would give us his shop. Shouldn't we pay the advance then? Are you going to start a business on your own? Everyone has taken a very good decision. Wait, wait. Why would I deny? Dear Goddess Maisamma, bless them. Your work should complete without any disturbance. - Here it is. Take it Madhu. - Thanks, Poorna sister. - Hail to Poorna sister! - Leave guys. Stop your crap! - Hail to Poorna sister! - I'm asking you to leave. You don't brush your teeth or clean your face. Is it necessary for you to wear a new dress every day? Hell with you! I'll become Tata Birla by investing this one rupee. - Hi, Basha brother. How are you? - Have you gone crazy? Oh no! Hey Poorna sister! Why are you shocked? - What is this dressing? - It is because we have a meeting today. With whom? The bank officers asked me to come for a meeting as we have applied for a loan. It doesn't seem good if we visit in that attire. So we have changed our attires. Yeah, you should go in this attire to such places. Poorna sister, did you receive any call asking for us? No. Poorna sister, we gave your number. Talk properly when the manager madam calls you. We are busy in the meeting. How do you know that it's the madam who would call? Because its her who accepts the proposal. - Proposal? - He means loan. Oh! Your language got changed with your dress. Hey Masthan brother! - Hey Mandu Babu! - I'm taking a basket full of tomatoes. - Hey Mandu Babu! - Leave me. Hey! What is this attire? Yeah! It's me. The phone is ringing. Hello. Hello, can I speak to Bunny sir? Yes, he is here. A girl is speaking. She might be calling from the bank. - Hello. - Am I speaking to Mr. Bunny? - Yeah, how are you? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Who answered the call priorly? - Oh, she was my P.A. - P.A? - When will you take your mobile? - I'll take it today. - Alright. Where will you meet me? Poorna sister, she asking me about the meeting spot. Ask her to come down to the central mall. - Yeah. - Central mall... Central mall... - Central mall? - Hmm. Okay? How much will it take for you to reach? I'll reach there in five minutes. I'm starting now. How can you come to the central mall from Monda market in just five minutes? I'm in a meeting at the necklace road. I'll start as soon it gets over. It just takes 5-10 minutes on bike. I'm coming. Oh! I have a car with me but I don't drive much. I love bike a lot. What is it? - Will you give the phone to your P.A? - To P.A? Why? Give it to her. I'll speak. - Take this. - Oh no! I cannot speak. Speak to her. - Hello. - Hi, P.A madam. Madam, there are very good people. You can give them a loan without any verification. Mother, it's me Chandini. Chandini, why did they call you? Is this what youth matter means? How dare you to borrow money from me and flirt with my daughter? Idiot! I'll break your legs if you ever come here citing it's a youth matter. All of you were working for Poorna sister since years. And you don't know who is Chandini! We used to think that Chandini is a customer of Poorna sister. Why will we think that she is the daughter of Poorna sister? Stop it! Hell with your nonsense! I'm worried about facing Poorna sister. Bro, give that to me. Hey! When did you order this? I ordered when you all were worried by putting your heads down. - Banda... - Hold on man! Leave it. Let's order. Tell me what you want? - I want strawberry. - I don't want anything. I want vanila. Alright, I'll order and come. Two vanila and two strawberry. Hello... Hello... No one is speaking. The call got disconnected. Is that Vikas? Hmm. I got a phone call. I have to leave immediately. I've paid the bill and you all have it, okay? I'll leave. Who is this Vikas? Did you see how SBM blushes when she receives a call from Vikas? Wait Who is he? My father. Then, why are you staying in a hostel? My parents got separated. Why did they separate? They hate each other, so they got separated. For every alternate month, my father and mother give money for my expenses. How can you smile when you have a lot of grief inside you? I do grieve but I never let it out. Forget about me. I have a place to live and clothes to wear. And I have even parents to ask anything. But, how can you be happy despite having no one for you? That's why I wanted to do friendship with you. Then, what about your boyfriend Vikas? Then, did you lie to us? Didn't you lie to me? You've told Madhu is love with me which is a blatant lie. - No... The thing is that... - Umm... I understand. I see my face in the mirror every day. Would any guy look at a girl of my kind? You have kept SBM as my name, didn't you? It means Soda Buddi Moham That's not what we meant... That is... Sorry, madam. Never mind, sir. I have to regret if I don't study well because that's my mistake. But am I to be blamed for being born as ugly? Why should I feel sad about the mistake which I didn't commit? Hey... Pity SBM! No... I mean Bhagavathi. Why should we care about what others feel? Let's continue calling her SBM. Hey, it was me who told that I was flirting with her. Let's me make convert that lie into fact. Hey, Banda and Bhagwati... - How's the pair? - Hey! My boys! Hey, when four of you shared the same T-shirt I understood about you guys that everyone of you are flirting the same girl. Look, this full bottle would show a way to your love and this empty bottle would turn your way. The girl belongs to the guy whom the bottle stops pointing at. - Yeah! - Banda... Hey, who is that? Oh God! Police! - Hey Mandu Babu! - Hey! - Oh no! Sir... - Are you intoxicated? Oh! Hey, who the hell is intoxicated? Who do you think I'm? I'll file a case against you, fool! Mandu Babu trapped us. The one and only peg have slipped. The milk business is in losses but they are still serving door delivery. Though the liquor is in full of profit, they aren't serving door delivery. They provide free chutney and curries for meals worth Rs. 40. But they aren't giving a chutney for free of cost on a quarter worth Rs. 100. - I'll give it for free if I was a chairman. - Sit down. Sir, how the hell will I become chairman? - Sir... - What is it with you? Sir, my husband is inside. - What is his name? - He is Swami. Swami... Swami... Who is Swami here? - Sir, it's me. - What are you doing while I'm calling you? Come. Hey! Who is Shekhar here? Go, your father came. Hey! Who are you all? Who will come for you? - What is your name? - I'm Madhu. - What is your name? - I'm Raja. - What? - I'm Raja. Raja! Which Raja is it? Kondapalli or Bobbili? - What is yours? - I'm Banda. - Idiot! - Oh God! Even the dogs have good names. What kind of a name 'Banda' is? Tell me your original name but not your pet name. Sir, my real name is Banda. You will be trashed. - What is your name? - I'm Chinna. Where do you stay? - In the market. - Don't you have a proper address? We stay there itself. What is your father's name? Else do you have such an ID proof? Srisailam. Hey! Who is Srisailam? Hey come! Mallesh, come. Venkataiah! Go, leave! Hey! Who is Dastagiri? Go. Hey! Hey! Get up. - Sir, let me sleep for some more time. - He slept as if this is his in-law's home. Go. Get lost! Hey! You can achieve anything at this age. Don't waste your time unnecessarily. Go out. - Sir! - Who are these guys? They are from Market. Sir, they were drunk last night and hit our jeep with that guy who is sleeping over there. Leave them. Hey waste fellows! Get up. Get up, I say. I'll trash you if I witness you again in the surroundings. Hey, get up! Hey! Who the hell are you? I'll file a complaint in the police station, that you are disturbing the one who is sleeping. Whom do you think am I? Then who am I? Who knows you? Rascal! Oh no! Greetings to you, sir. I don't know anything. I swear, let's run. Take it. Wow! They are sleeping as if nothing has happened. Hey! Get up. Get up! Get up! Hey! I'll bash you like anything. - Sorry, Poorna sister. - Hey! Bring that here. These idiots are speaking in English as they changed their attire. Each of them is showcasing as if they are heroes. Hey! Fold your legs. Did you eat anything since yesterday despite grooming yourself? - I can see that on your face. - She served us moong dal. Eat quickly. Forget about moong dal, I should give you poison. Mother, you please stay calm. Let them have food. They can't even afford food if they don't do their work for one day. But they want love! Love! That too at this age! Who asked you to do so? How dare is he to suggest you lie to me, take the money and flirt with my daughter? Have you heard about Mallaiah? He can single-handedly carry an entire load of a lorry. He was infected with chikungunya and couldn't work anymore. Which is why I tell you guys that not every day is a good day. - Fine, leave it Poorna sister. - Hell with you! They are saying that there might be a lorries strike very soon. What will you do then? You know nothing except carrying the sacks. Yes, Poorna sister. We aren't aware of anything because we are orphans. We would've gone to a school like Chandini if we were born to you. Even Chandini would've worked like us in the market, if she was an orphan. Poorna sister, is it our mistake to born like an orphan? You are right. It's not your mistake for being an orphan. But whose mistake is it if you die as an orphan? You might not be the reason for your present status. But for sure you are the reason for your status in the future. It's you. Think before you take a decision from now on. What is it, dude? Aren't you feeling sleepy? I'm scared thinking of Poorna sister's words. Hey! The lorries will come in some time. Though we carry sacks at the night, we have to trim our daytime sleep and earn money by working hard. Rs. 10 per heap! Rs. 10 per heap! Carrots at Rs. 5 per kg. Carrots at Rs. 5 per kg. - Rs. 20. - Okra ladies finger at Rs. 10 per kg... Hey wait! My counting is going wrong. Count it slowly. Everyone knew that you are poor at maths. 1000, 1100, 1200... Hey Madhu! Poorna sister is here. 30, 40... It's good that you thought to work hard and earn. That doesn't mean you pick the leftover vegetables and sell them. Come with me, come. How many temples do I visit? I visited many and at last constructed a temple too. Visit this temple. God is very powerful. Mr. Rayudu, everyone who has visited that temple was blessed with a child. Alright, I'll visit it as you are insisting. - Oh, Poorna sister. - Greetings Mr. Rayudu. Hey! Bring the chair. Oh no! That's alright. What brings you here? Uh... These children... They work at our market, right? That is... The earned money isn't enough for their daily needs... Do you want me to help? They can save some money if you can help them. Help? What did they study? - Mr. Rayudu, there are illiterates. - Poorna sister... - If you can help them... - Poorna sister... - What is it? - Class 2... Class 2... - Shut your mouth! - Did you study till Intermediate 2nd year? He is saying that he was educated till class 2. Oh! Then, he is the one who is the most educated guy amongst them. Yeah. Mr. Rayudu, they will be forever grateful if you can help them. I'll for sure do something but give me just two days of time. - Okay, sir. - Alright. Hey! Think about the best business idea to implement, which has huge profits when Mr. Rayudu helps us. Sitting idol doesn't help you. Poorna sister, stereo and mic system rental will have huge profits. After Bonalu festival, it is Dussehra. And after that, it would be Diwali. We will be busy with the functions in the whole year. Yeah, not only that... There would be SBM's and Chandini's wedding, name ceremony of their children. And we be full of hectic life. Yeah, establish a drama company along with the stereo and mic system. You can play dramas daily. Mic set it seems! Idiot! Hey! I have an awesome idea. Let's buy a lorry and supply the goods in the market. Hey youth matter! How will you drive a lorry when you don't have a license? Who will give you the license when you are not even 18 years old? Suggest the one which is possible. How about an auto which drops children to the school? - Even that comes with a license. - Let's start a fancy store... with bangles, bindi, kajal, powder and fair and lovely. Have you come again to the youth matter? Dear, single bud blossoms into a single flower chanter! We will be in losses if we start a business for your beauty. Look! We are aware of this market only. This is our world. Think about what we can do by staying here. All types of vegetables are available in the market except good food. Oh, Poorna sister! I was waiting for you. I gave a thought about your requirement. Uh... Do one thing. I have a shop behind the market road. I'm using it as a warehouse. If you want it then I shall give some portion of it to your children. Ask them to start a small-scale business there. Just our men shall be coming there occasionally. Mr. Rayudu, it isn't that easy. How can we pay the huge advance and rents? Poorna sister, give me a minute. Who asked you to pay the advances and rents? Ask them to start a small-scale business there. - Later on, we can discuss the rents. - No, Mr. Rayudu. How can we take it for free? Alright, I'll take it some as it is a ritual. Give me what you have now. I'll consider it as an advance. Oh no! I don't have money at this moment. - What is it? - One rupee. Give that to me. One rupee. - Rajanna. - Yes, brother. Our shop advance is one rupee. Hey Bala! Ask Linga to bring the shop keys. Okay, brother. God gave us what we wanted. Shall we name it after Poorna sister? Shall we name it as Mandu babu? - Shall we name it as Powestar hotel? - Hmm. - Shall we name it as Bunny hotel? - Hey! "Life is just a casino. No one knows how to play." "Get to know, roll your dice and finish it." Why do you want to name it after me? "Get into it and play your role." "Achieve the zenith" "Conquer the sky." "Life is just a casino. No one knows how to play." "Get to know, roll your dice and finish it." "See the end of it." "Get into it and play your role."

You will buy a bike? Here is the ID proof, address proof, Gas book and passbook. Do you want anything else? Awesome. What are you doing here instead of working? What is she doing? Oh no! Poorna sister. Madam, we cannot give you bike on loan. We will give you if the managers of Poorna hotel give us the surety. No, thanks. - There is no need for a bike. - Poorna sister... Poorna sister... - If she goes to school on a scooter... - Mother. She looks like a heroine. - Alright, come. - Please, mother... You should give the guarantee it seems. Give me. Here is the sweet. - What is the occasion? - My sister is pregnant. "That burning fire doesn't quench if you have the zeal." "Don't live as if you are one in four" "make yourself equal to ten and reign." "No one wants a name which vanishes upon death." "You should be a brand despite your presence." "Life is just a casino.

"Conquer the sky." You don't have helmet onto that you are riding triples. Hey leave them! They belong to the Poorna sister's hotel. Hey! Stop the vehicle. Oh! So this is it. Hey Madhu!

Guys usually propose after liking. You both can roam happily if you accept him. Else they will go into another route if you reject their love. Accept him quickly. I'll not accept that quickly. He should wait until I accept him. I'll think over it. - What did she say? - She says she wants time till tomorrow. I'll call you brother-in-law if she wears green. But if she wears red, I call you uncle. - What if she comes in the yellow dress? - That means she is in love with you. - Oh no! - Why? What happened? Poor guy! He is already in love with a girl. Does she know about it? Come on, dude! Who is Bunny? He is our stylish star who acted in the films 'Desamuduru', 'Sarainodu' etc. Oh, is it Mr. Allu Arjun? He is Megastar's nephew. All his fans call him as Bunny. Our Chandini likes Bunny a lot. Oh no! Mother! - Chandini doesn't like anyone so easily. - Mother, please stop it. I don't know the reason but she is appreciating Bunny a lot. Mother, I'm going home. Take Chandini to a Bunny's film nearby. What happened? Wait, I'm coming. 14... What happened? Why are you laughing? Chandini likes Bunny a lot it seems. Hey! We should show a Bunny's film to Chandini it seems. Alright, control it. See you all. - Bye, Bunny. - Bye.

Santu and Shankar are coming. - They are very nearby it seems. - Alright, let them come. The cooked food is being wasted. She said she'd go to tuition after the school, mom. Is it so? Poorna sister. Look after them. We'll come tomorrow. Come. Come. - Hey! Bring 2 more glasses. - Greetings, brother. Yeah, I'm bringing. Brother, the glass is here. Boss, seems like the clients have come. Will I spare them if they don't come? What do you think of Mr. Rayudu's brother-in-law? Huh! Not just one, but I got him married to both my sisters. - Hey!

Yes, brother. Alright, it's already late. You go and sleep. - Brother, we should close the shop. - Go to the room and sleep for today. Give me the hotel keys and go. Hey! Go and switch off the lights. The whole goods are inside and the door is open. What if something happens when they switch on the gas cylinder inebriety state? You stay here and come after locking. - Brother, we are leaving. - See you, brother. Drop them all and come. Bye, bye. Brother, she belongs to our town. She missed her bus.

Come here. Brother, give me the key. Did you come just now or you were here since then? The curse of a woman will definitely come true. You will rot in hell! How dare you to point your finger on me?

What happened? - Hey Banda! What happened? - Hey! What happened? Hey Banda! Why are you crying? - Hey! - That Linga... That Linga... - What did he do? - He hit me. Why? He brought an aunty yesterday and... Shucks! Ugh! We shouldn't spare him. Raja, keep quiet. Keep quiet? Who the hell is he to hit us? Please try to understand. The hotel is important to us. Do we need to plead him for that? I'm ready to do that for our hotel. All of you keep quiet. Okay? Brother... Brother... It's morning. It's time to open the hotel. Please get up... Brother, please get up... Brother, please get up... Hey Bala! Get up. What is it, brother? Raja, keep the stove ready. Banda, sweep the dust. Hey! Put that key there. He is not even staring at me despite giving him a signal. - Send the matchbox. - I'm bringing it, brother. Hey! Not you. Come. - Go. - No. - He is calling me to hit me. - Nothing will happen. Go. He is not even staring at me. Am I looking that bad in this dress? Come closer. Did you tell anyone regarding what has happened in the night? No. What about your friends? Will you smoke? No? No. Then what about it? You are already 16 years old. You might've already started everything. The woman who came in the last night... is awesome. Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Leave me... Leave me... - Hey! - Hey! Leave me... - Hey! - Hey! - How dare you to mess with me? - Hey! - Hey bastard! Hey! Leave me. Hey! Hey! My apologies! I'll not spare you! Hey! I'll kill you. Poorna sister... Poorna sister... There is an arguement going on at our hotel. Hey! Why are you all standing outside? Why did you close the hotel at this time? Tell me what happened? - Tell me, what did you guys do? - Poorna sister... Poorna sister... Don't hit our boys without knowing what happened. Our boys wouldn't have committed any mistake. - Idiots! Did you come here also? - Hey! - Oh no! Don't harm them. - Hey Linga! Poorna sister, what is it? Why did you come here? Mr. Rayudu, I want to discuss something with you. Come upstairs. What is it, Poorna sister? Last night, Linga brought a woman to our hotel and... How many times do I need to tell you not to meddle with the woman who comes alone to the bus stand? I have to hang my head in shame because of your mistakes. What's next? Later on, they boozed in the hotel and... And? They brought some boxes it seems Mr. Rayudu. Huh! Look Poorna sister, previously it was our warehouse. We will put the goods there and I've already mentioned about this earlier. And now you are complaining about our men that they are boozing. What's wrong in it? I don't booze and everyone knows about it. But my men works hard for me. They work all day and their body gets tired. Shouldn't they relax? But Mr. Rayudu, those activities shouldn't happen at our hotel. Look Poorna sister, it's a hotel for you and it's a warehouse for them. Do you think that I'm crazy to give you such a huge place for free in the market? We need a warehouse to store the goods. It will be free in the day time. You came to me and asked to help these boys on your own. I gave them thinking that it would help him. It was my mistake, isn't it? No, Mr. Rayudu. I'll be careful from now on. - Our boys... - No, Poorna sister. You need to understand one thing. We deal with the money in the market. In order to run that business smoothly, everyone in the market should fear me and my men. If not, our debts won't be recovered. How should we manage our business if the money is not recovery? People in the market respect and fear me. Won't they make fun of me if someone bashes Mr. Rayudu's brother-in-law? I've built this fortress and been saving this fortress since then, - and this worthless fools... - Hey! - Oh no! - Hey wait! You should've shown this aggression over there. - You should've killed them there itself. - Oh no! You find it in the place you've lost. Poorna sister, you take them to the hotel. Linga will come there and bash them. Tell them to suffer it silently. The people in the market shouldn't oppose me after watching it. They should learn that they cannot survive by opposing Rayudu. - Mr. Rayudu... - Hey! Take them. Mr. Rayudu... Listen to me. Hey! Poorna sister, let it be in this way for today. You can run th hotel from tomorrow. Hey Linga! You should go to that area only in night times. Did you get it? Take them. Poorna sister. The boys are still young. If they are frightened and run away... the humiliation we faced will be remained as it is. Let's do one thing. Let's send the boys and you stay here. I'll leave you as soon as my men finish the work. Hey, take them! Arrange a chair for Poorna sister. Poorna sister. - Poorna sister. - Poorna sister. - Poorna sister... - Poorna sister... We lived without anyone for 16 years. We've earned an address for the first time. We will leave our lives but not the address. This is our address for lifelong. - Get down. - Hey! Hey! Hey! Have you all come here to bash just four boys? Hey! All those who watched the morning event should come here. - Hey! - Hey, come! - Hey, come! - Hey, come! Hey, come! Hey! Give a cup of coffee to Poorna sister. Poorna sister, it might be the mercy of your husband or your lucky hand, I'm in this position after doing financial business by taking a loan from you. I'm still grateful for it. Even you are the same. You are living with dignity even if you don't have a husband. You get panic. Nothing will happen to those boys. They'll just hit him. They are very young. You should know since you are an elder. After this, are they going to face the humiliation or you? Put it inside. Hey! What are you doing? Brother, I'm shooting a video to post it in the facebook. Continue. Everyone should know about us. Shoot it. Shall we start? Who will go first? - Brother, I'll go first. - Brother, I'll go first. - Hey! You are a karate master, right? - Yes, brother... Yes, brother... Today, we should know how good you are at karate. Hey, come here! Hey! Come here. Start it. Enough of your hype. Start it. Hey! Was that karate? He is still standing. Hey Banda! Come here. Come here... Come here... Wait... Hey baldie! You are good at bashing, right? - Yes, brother. - You carry on. Brother, please don't hit here. Everyone will be watching. Take me somewhere and hit. Hey! I'm putting up this show so that everyone can watch this. - Brother, no... Brother, no... - Why are you acting smart? Do we need to take you to the neighbouring street and hit? - Hey! - Brother, don't hit me... Why is even the orphan is shouting upon getting bashed? Hey! You come here. He is coming upon calling that guy. Brother, why is he coming like a hero by stopping him? He is looking fair amongst the other boys, right? Take your footwear... Take your footwear... He might've born to his parents before their marriage. Well said, brother. - Banda... - Banda... - Banda... - Banda, what happened? - Oh no! Raja, tell me what happened? - Who is this beautiful girl? It's blood! - What happened? - What's with the female indulgence? - Banda, what happened? - Who are you? I'm Poorna sister's daughter. - Poorna sister's daughter? - Brother, please leave her. - Does Poorna sister have... - Brother, please leave her... - such a beautiful daughter? - Brother, please leave her... - Brother, please leave her... - He is wasting my time, - by interrupting. - Stop it. - Brother, please leave her... - She is Poorna sister's daughter it seems. Brother, please leave her... - Sister's daughter will be my relative. - Hey! Stop it! - Hey! - Brother, please leave her... - Give me a kiss. - Hey! Hey Bala! Call Linga and enquiry about the situation there. He is so angry that he might kill them. - Inspector, did you go to the market? - I'm at the spot. - Did they hit them hard? - Yeah. Alright, admit them in the hospital. I'll take care of the expenses. Hey! Go back. - Sir, it wasn't their mistake. - Go. Hey! Close it. What did the doctor say? The reports are normal. Brother-in-law, why are you tensed? I'm there right? Poorna sister, why are you sitting here? Come inside. Poorna sister, at least come and sit on the sofa. Bala, bring a chair. Sister, come. - Why? - Come, I'll tell you... Suri, start the vehicle. Hey Bala, come. Bring Poorna sister, along with you. - Doctor, are you treating all of them? - Yes, sir. There is no problem, right? There is no problem. Hey! Leave her. Hey! What is this? Who bashed you? Hey! Tell me who was it? Hey! Doctor, what are these injuries and bandages? Huh? Doctor, what happend tell me. Who hit them? How dare are they to hit my men? Who is that? Tell me. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Get lost! Mr. Rayudu, this is called as youth matter. Where is your honour as a respected person? Did you face the humiliation now or the boys? Argh! I'll kill you. I died the next minute when you made me sit in your home. Hey! I'll... Leave me. Tell me, Mr. Rayudu. Hey! Where are those four boys? - They are here in the station. - Bring them here. I want them. No, Mr. Rayudu. I haven't filed the FIR yet. - Why don't you adjust? - Hey! Are you planning to save them? Mr. Rayudu, it will a problem for you if I file the FIR. Hey! I know what will happen. - Linga... - Linga... Brother, we have searched in the entire hospital. Linga is missing. Hey! What is it? Our sister is in their home. So? Linga will go only when Poorna sister comes here. Even you are right. But the hotel's land is on Mr. Rayudu's name. I cannot take action no matter how many of you complain. That is not even a case. Look, listen to me. I'll speak to Mr. Rayudu. It's hard to survive here by opposing him. Listen to me. Go to any other city and live there. - Then, what about our hotel? - Listen to me. Sir, you have a job, a house to live, and you've wife, children, parents and everyone to share your feelings. But hotel is everything to us. Hey! Leave her. - Hey Prasad! Go and drop her at her home. - Okay, sir. Sir, can you please give me your mobile? - Hello. - Show him Linga. Hey! Take Linga to the hospital. - Hey! - Mr. Rayudu, please wait. No, inspector. Don't stop me. I already told you in call that, everybody in the market would trouble me if these boys are excused. Mr. Rayudu, I haven't filed the FIR yet. Are you supporting these boys? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry... Sorry... Someone said that they woudn't extricate Linga, unless we extricate Poorna sister, right? He shouldn't be alive. Who is he? Mr. Rayudu, it's me. Mr. Rayudu, it's me. No, he is lying. Mr. Rayudu, it's me. - Brother-in-law, what happened? - I'm discussing it. Brother-in-law, don't excuse them... I'll decide about it. You disconnect the call. Mr. Rayudu, what about the hotel? First, take those boys to the hospital. Later on, we'll discuss about it. By the way Ganesh, take them to hotel and feed them their stomach full. - Okay, sir. - And drop them at the market. Okay, sir. Sir. Thank you very much, sir. Hey Banda! SBM came in a green dress which means she accepted it. Hello. Hello. Where are those boys? They are with me, brother. I'm bringing them. Hey, get down! - Brother, why did you drop us here? - Shut up and stay here! Madhu. Leave us. - Hey! - Hey! Stop it. Hey! - Madhu... Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey Madhu! - Hey! - Madhu...

Oh God! This girl hasn't forgot Bunny yet! Why don't you put some God's picture instead of him? Sister, this is our youth's matter. Hey! Where did you go for these many days?

The boys who work at Poorna sister's hotel. What? You are going to start a hotel? Are you out of your minds? - Even after what had happened... - Why shouldn't we start Poorna sister? Is it that we put all our efforts and develop the hotel to go waste? It is their land. So what? We don't want to do anything with theirs. We shall start beside it. Do you want to invite trouble again? We should search for something in the place where we lost it, Poorna sister. Is it only him who can search for something in the place where he lost it? Can't we search? He beat the hell out of us on that day. We'll show him what we are capable of. He showed us the depth of grief, tears and blood, Poorna sister. Listen. Would anyone want to mess with fire? What mistake did we do? Forget us, what mistake did she do? Why shouldn't we step inside the market? That's okay. But, what if something bad happens again? Despite we are destitutes, they wanted to wipe us out completely. We won't spare them. We have nothing to lose. They are scared because our entry might bring adverse effect on them. All we are left with is destroying them. We might be weak who can't fight back, but we aren't kids who get scared and run away, Poorna sister. It is the matter that should dealt with highly respected people. Do you mean highly respected people to be old men? Shall I tell Rayudu that you called him an old man? What do you say, dude? Shall I set her against Rayudu? Mr Rayudu, seems like it's just you who is filing nomination like every time? Who will have the courage too lock horn with a lion? That's alright. Anyhow, we shall wait till the evening as a formality. If no one turns up, we shall announce the results tomorrow itself. Hmm... There a some forms in this file. Fill them up and get them tomorrow. Since when you have been incumbent here? Since 15 years. Oh, 15 years! Just you? Here, take it. No, thank you. You have it. Mr Rayudu, it looks very calm. If you mess with this, the bottle will blast like a volcano. Poorna sister, what do you want to ask again that you've come here? We came to ask you to give us back the thing which you took it from us. Do you own that hotel? It's not just a hotel. It's our livelihood. That's our memory. - What's with your pride? - Hey! Inspector, what's all this? What do I know, Mr Rayudu? Madam asked for security to file nomination. That's why we are here. Nomination? Can you lock horns with me and win in this market? It doesn't matter if I lose. It is enough if we stand against you, Mr Rayudu. You won't get a single vote. Not an issue. All these days, no one had the courage to stand against him. Filing nomination against you itself suggests you have lost. Even if a small crack appears in the fortress which you have built for 15 years that's enough. Woohoo! Hey boys! How is my style? Sir, how are you doing? Ah! Greetings, Mr Rayudu. He is the candidate who is going to stand against you. Ah! Do you think Mr Rayudu is some cheap candidate? We have selected you as you'd match his level, Mandu Babu. Shut your mouth! Greetings, brother. Brother, he is asking for your vote. Didn't you forget what had happened? We aren't kids to forget it. We are youth. Boys, keep quite. Mr Rayudu, there is a saying that a big stick has to used even to kill a small snake. You have to escape before it bites you. They just hiss but never bite. - I've arranged everything for settlement. - Brother! - Ah! - There is a meeting going on over here, what are you doing over there, brother? - Hey, you idiot! - Hey... Hey Linga... Linga... Listen to me. Leave this place. Hey, leave him. You are doing a mistake, Poorna sister. It is an elephant that you are battling with. - But not with a mouse. - If yours is an army of elephants, I'm a goad. Hey! You and your goad can't even pull my hair out. Brother, the minister has arrived. - Greetings, brother... - Greetings... Greetings... Greetings... Greetings... Why did you grow your beard, Mr Rayudu? A junior Rayudu is about to arrive in his house in a few days, Mr Minister. It means we are about to receive another vote. Brother... Rayudu, people who work sincerely like you should join our party. Only then, there would be an increase of strength in our party. What does having 300 shops in the market mean? It means 400 to 500 families are with you. Forget about winning against you, it's not even possible for anyone to file a nomination against you. You are winning unanimously even this time, right? Yes, brother. Hey, get in. - Not now, brother. - Why? The commissioner has arrived to the market. We'll go in the evening. Commissioner? Oh! Greetings, brother. I'm competing for the chairman post in this market election with your inspiration. Earlier, installing your cut-out is enough for the work to get it done. But now, fixing your poster is helping in the formation of good governments. Brother, if you bless me, I'll become the chairman of this market. Greetings... Greetings... Greetings... You should vote for me. What will you give me in exchange? I'm there for you, right? Ugh! You are fat. Then, will you accept the actor of Bahubali movie? Do you mean Prabhas? Yes, someone like him. He is Kilkili Prabhakar. Greetings, brother. You'll vote for me, right? What will you give me in exchange? I'll give you good governance. Forget governance. If you give me money, I'll vote for you. Greetings... Greetings... Everyone is doing good, right? Sister, you have to vote for me. Did you get registered to vote? Go away... Go... Brother... Hello, brother... No one is bothering about me. - Sister-in-law... - Drunkard, get lost! - Brother... - Who will vote for you? Hey, I have carried your sacks and unloaded your cargo. You have sold them and earned a lot of money. But when I ask you to vote for me, you refuse to do so, idiots! Hey, hell with you and your families! - You shouldn't be trusted. - Hey, hell with you and your families! Who is the hell is that? It's me, your fan. How the hell can you be my fan? Hell with you! I won't trust you. You are a big fraudster! - Brother... - Yes. Not just my vote, The vote of my wife, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, my neighbours' vote, the vote of the guy who lives in my opposite house, - and all the votes in my colony is for you. - Hey! Hey, you look like a ray of hope to me. Well... What do you drink, whisky or brandy? Brother, we don't want all those now. But I want Vodka. - Oh, you want RGV's vodka! - Yes, this life imbibes only RGV's vodka. - I'll get it. - Go, get it brother. Brother, I have something to tell you. Forget it. We'll talk about it later. Okay, brother. Rathalu, did you come to buy vegetables? You'll get slapped with my footwear! She's got a cursing mouth! Brother... - Oh, you came. - It will be superb. If you mix with lemon juice, - it will be sour. - Okay... Would you like to have chicken or mutton? We don't want all those now. I'll have chilli prawns. You mean tender chilli prawns? I'll get them now. Brother, I have something to tell you. - Wait. We'll talk about leisurely. - Okay. Brother, here is the chilly prawns. - He cooked it very deliciously. - Thanks, brother. Well... What would your children eat, sweet or spicy food? Why do you ask that, brother? They eat both. Ah! I'll get it. Here, take it brother. I've got it specially packed. I've kept jasmine flowers in the bag for your wife. - Okay... - Well, brother... How will you travel to your village, in an auto-rickshaw or a bus? We don't want all those now, brother. - Thanks, brother. - Hey, take him safely. By the way, you've been asking me that you want to tell me something. What is it? I'll tell you, brother. Hey, start the engine. - The votes of my mine and my wife... - Didn't you get registered or what? No, we do got registered. Then? We got registered. What's the problem then, bother? I'll tell you. Hey, move the first gear. The votes of mine and wife aren't registered for the market constituency. Then? We've been registered to vote in our village. Hey, you idiot! You'll rot in hell! You'll be eaten by insects! Black... How dare you reveal the truth after reaping all the benefits! You'll rot in hell! Hey, which idiot from this place will vote for me? I would be that idiot. I'll vote for you. What's the guarantee? Brother, did Naidu ever find a job for me? You got me into a lot of jobs. If I become the chairman, I'll make Naidu jobless. Brother... I thought he would get the same doubt, I've been carrying the ballot paper in my pocket every time I vote. - Will you vote for me for sure? - See you, brother. I'll lose practice. Wouldn't they drop the slip in the ballot box when they vote? Ugh! Dirty life! I neither want this get-up nor that politics. My booze and my arrangement is correct for me. I'll have a quarter bottle of Vodka and tweet at nights like RGV. My life would be comfortable. What you drink is not Vodka. Hey, fool! That bottle too will be colourless. Hell with your eyes! No one is lesser here. What's the poster that you've pasted? POORNAKKA'S HOTEL Poorna sister's hotel will restart from tomorrow. An order of Idli will fetch you free Chutney. An order of Poori will fetch you free curry. An order of Rice and Sambar will fetch you free Papad, pickle and a water packet. The chief guest is Sri Sri Sri Chiranjeevi Naagu alias Mandhu Babu. Invited by Madhu, Raja, Banda and Chinna. Ah! You are doing something fishy. What's your plan? You are competiting for the market election, right? The entire market will be under your control. Ah! Then, you can get us our hotel back, can't you? Um... Hey, you guys have decided to do something to me. I'm able to understand all that. Tell me... Tell me... I'm asking you. Tell me... Ah! Look there... Umm... Ah! Plan A. Plan A? They might have planned something. I will stand brave along with them. I heard somewhere that life means overcoming the fear. Now, I'll show them my courage. Hmm... Plan B. Oh! Why isn't there any sound? Did they change the plan? There isn't no one beside me. Ah! I have a plan C. Woah! Hey... - Hey... - Hey... Hey! Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey Madhu, Raja, Chinna, Banda, get into the vehicle. Get into the vehicle quickly. What are you looking at? Just get in. Get in... Quickly... Get in... Come on... Come on... Drive fast, Mandhu Babu. - Drive fast. - Faster... Faster... Drive fast. The auto-rickshaws are coming closer... Drive fast. They are coming closer... Mandhu Babu... Faster... Faster... Hey, it's the Police jeep. Lookout. - Oh no! - Hey Madhu. Did they leave? Eh? Ah! Greetings, sir. Hey, are you drunk? Yes, I'm drunk. What the hell can you do about it? Did they get caught? They are with the Police. No matter how much late it might be, chop them upon catching them. I'm also coming. Why don't you switch on the lights? Hey! Who the hell switched-on the lights? Switch them off. Sister, come with me. - What's this? - Come, sister. - When did you start having these habits? - Come, sister... I'll explain. - Come, sister. - Why did you turn out to be like this? - I'll explain. Come, sister... - You did swear on God too. What's up, boys? You seem to be very excited. You should have come fifteen minutes ago, sir. You have come after everything is over like the cops in the movie. What happened? Not yet finished. A lot of film is remaining. Everyone is here, which means, Rayudu might be all alone at his home. Hey! Shh! Hey, stab him! Hey, are you out of your minds? We won't get this chance again? Tell me if you are scared, I'll stab him. Did they come home at night? They arrived at late night and slept on the terrace. Heard that you guys came home late at night. We went to do some important work. What's with you, guys? You seem excited. From now on, the entire market will be very excited, Poorna sister. Eh? What's he saying, Madhu? The thing is that Poorna sister... Aw... Er... Why are you mumbling? Mom, it's time to go to school. I'm leaving. Hey, 'single bud-single flower' quote girl, Shall I comb your hair and tie the plait? Hey! Be it delicious food or even ambrosia, every food matters to the people with no teeth in the same way. Sister... sister... - Sister... Nothing happened to you, right? - What happened? What happened? You and your goad can't even pull my hair out. Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law... What happened, brother-in-law? Brother-in-law... Shucks! What happened? Oh no! Oh no! Hello. - Do you want anything else. - Uhuh - Sit behind. - Yes. What are you looking at? Go, get them. - Run... Run... - Hey... Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Catch them. Hey... Hey, come this side. Hey, catch them... Hey... Catch them... Stop... - Hey... - Come... Uh! - Hey Banda! What happened? - Hey... Banda... Hey Banda... Get up - Hey... You! Mahesh, get me the sword. Get it. Hey wait. Hey! Run fast - Come... Hey, wait... Hey, stop. Jump... Make it fast. Oh no! There are no people here. Hey! Daddy... Daddy... Daddy... - Pavitra, Lakshmi... Wait... - Lakshmi, look here. This is my dad. Hey! Hey! I'v spared you because your are kids. But you have meddled with me! Till now, you saw Rayudu of Monda market. You never saw the demon inside me, right? I'll bring it out today. Did you come to take the progress report? It's in headmaster's room. Go, meet him and take it. Daddy, she is the sister who gives us free tuition everyday. Hey children, come here. Pavitra, you too get into the class. - All of you, come inside. Quick. - Go to the class. I'll talk. He is the one, sir. Hey, mister. Just a minute. Why didn't you come to school after joining your daughter in the school? There is a lot to talk to you. Come inside. Hey, get two teas. You came to kill us, right? You want to remain like a good father or a murderer? - Brother, open the shutter. - Open the shutter... - Brother-in-law, open the shutter. - Open the shutter... - Brother-in-law, open the shutter. - Open the shutter... Try to open the shutter. - Madhu, Banda, Raja, Chinna... - Brother-in-law... How dare you meddle with Rayudu of Monda market? Oh no! What happened? Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law... Chinna... Hey, wait guys... Hey, leave them. I insist. - We will kill them, brother. - Hey! Raja... They will die if they get beaten further. Leave. Hey Banda... Hey... Hey... I'm asking you to leave, don't you get it? Madhu... Madhu... They will never mess with me again. Leave them. How dare they lay their hands on you? I have taught them a lesson. Madhu... They are just kids... They are unwary of what they did. We'll kill you if you guys meddle with Mr Rayudu again. Oh no! You didn't listen to me. Hey! Hey! Hey... Hey... Hey... Come... Hey... Hey... Come on... Hey, let go of him... Hey, let go of him... - Hey, let go of him... - Hey, let go of him... - Hey, let go of him... - Come on, let go of him... Oh! Hmph! Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey, catch me... Hey... Hey... Hey... Leave me... If you raise the shutter, they will chop you and throw you in the dump yard. Getting thrown in a dump yard is nothing new to us as we were born there. We'll kill you by that time. Hey, what nonsense are you talking? Huh? We hit you on your head. It would take no time to kill you. Didn't you get it? Didn't you understand what you have snatched from us? We were addressed by everyone including lorry drivers as 'boy', 'coolie', and this hotel made us known to the society as 'Poorna sister's boys'. Do you what is the worst thing in this world? Getting one's idendity wiped off. You too have an identity, don't you? Everyone respects and fears you. You roamed in the marked like a lion. We'll ruin that identity. Don't you still get it? Now, we'll show what we are capable of. Do you what happens if we show you to the market people in this situation? You have stripped and thrown us on the road, didn't you? We'll do the same to you. No more talking with him. Just strip him off. Hey... Hey... Don't do this... Don't do this... Hey... Hey... Hey... - Hey... - Don't make them raise the shutter. - You raise it. - Don't do that. Let every watch this lion. Hey... Hey... Don't do that... Don't raise the shutter... Kill me if you wish to. It's better that I die after losing honour. Kill me... Just kill me... I plead you. I can't live with this humiliation. You aren't a bad person, Mr Rayudu. We didn't ruin your identity. We reminded it to you. Even the sacks that enter into the market has some number and address for them. But what about us who carries those sacks? We were destitute and you gave us an identity. Mr Rayudu, not only you did give us the hotel but a life which cannot be given by parents too. Wear your shirt, Mr Rayudu. It feels I'm born again. I don't understand what's happening in my life. I don't get it. Didn't you understand? I'll tell you in the language that you understand. Listen, human.
