The third Saturday in October, a moniker given to one of the most bitter college football rivalries in the United States, the yearly matchup between the Alabama-Mobile Seahawks and the Tennessee A&M Commonwealth. In 1979, this appellation would also become forever linked with a series of bizarre and grisly murders committed by a deranged death row inmate named Jakkariah Harding. For his victims, a quaint fall day of football, Romance, and off-beat fun would quickly descend into a surreal nightmare. The following film is a recreation of the events that transpired on that fateful October weekend. Events that took place on the third Saturday in October. $6.25. Grandma's nana pudding, $3.25. World famous catfish, $6.25. You can beat the prices at Norman's Catfish Cabin, but you can't beat the taste. Norman's Catfish Cabin, now open in Hackleburg, behind Hank's Good Stuff. Channel 2 news 11:00 update with Linda Brock, Jerry Cartwright, meteorologist Conway Darby, and more of Alabama's leading news team. Tomorrow night, two of the most storied programs in college football square off in what's historically been called "The Third Saturday in October", the date reserved for a showdown between the Alabama-Mobile Seahawks and Tennessee A&M Commonwealth. Few folks know this rivalry better than Alabama-Mobile head coach Amos Redd. I had a chance to catch up with the old ball coach to discuss what the Third Saturday in October rivalry means to him. Now in my playin' days, Coach Hodge Griffin was the head ball coach here. Now, we didn't play the game from 1942 till '45, "cause of World War II. And on the eve of that game, word got back around to Coach Randy Hale over Tennessee A&M, that Coach Hodge said, he would rather kiss a Nazi girl on the lips than lose to Tennessee A&M. Well, that next day, they beat the dog piss out of us. 45 to nothing. Dang, Coach Redd ain't playin'. I heard Coach Redd tell that story at the Kiwanis Club. It was just as good then. Dang, I'm gettin' my butt kicked, ain't I? You sound surprised, Daddy. Well, I'm tired of it. Now, this is 1979 rendition. I want to tell you something. You gonna throw them bones or you gonna shake "em all night? Alright. Smart-ass. Something special. Let's look in the pantry. Yahtzee. What? Oh, that... that's it. Baby, I'm done. I'm all Yahtzee'd out for the night. Oh, Daddy, it's only 10:00 o"clock! Says the person who doesn't get up at 6:00 a.m. every morning. Yeah, it's only 10:00 o"clock. You're right. I swear I've never laid eyes on anyone as lucky as you. You know how you're so lucky? - Why? - "Cause I'm your daddy. Alright, goodnight. Goodnight, Daddy. Get some rest. Damn. Oh, don't forget. Tomorrow night, right here for kick off. I'll be right here on this couch. War damn Seahawk. War damn Seahawk, Daddy. Give them Commonwealths hell. Tonight's top story takes us to the death row unit at Bowling Prison in Mobile, where spree killer Jack Harding is set to be executed tonight at midnight. Jerry, what's the mood in Mobile? Now, Linda, the mood here is one mostly of jubilation. Behind me are numerous... Well, I can't exactly call them "“protesters" ”. Some of them are wearing commemorative T-shirts, which celebrate tonight's execution. Now, Linda, if you're wondering about the T-shirts, those are the creation of this man and his lovely two friends. Hank Zbornak. Hank, what's the story behind the T-shirts? Well, listen, I run me a store up there in Hackleburg called Hank's Good Stuff. I've been in business about 1966. And my friend Marty Dixon was one of the victims of this killin' spree. And I thought it right fit that I'd come out here tonight Celebrate old Marty's life with some T-shirts. Come on down to Hackleburg, get you one. We love you, Marty. Come on down to Hank's Good Stuff. Monsters. Now, Linda, as for people that are actually attending tonight's execution, only two names appear on the state's list of attendees. And for privacy reasons, we will not be revealing those names to you tonight, but I can tell you that both of them lost children at the hands of this killer back in 1960. - Burn, baby, burn! - Keep on at it! - Burn, baby, burn! - He's gonna burn in hell! - Burn, baby, burn! - Yo, cheer! - Burn, baby, burn! - Cheer! - Burn, baby, burn! - Cheer!

Not since that court room back in Limestone County. Yeah. Come. I'll be honest uh, I wasn't sure if you were gonna be here. It's my duty to be here. Hell, I'm glad you are. I don't reckon I could do this alone. Burn, baby, burn! Burn, baby, burn! You're not alone, Vicki Newton. Burn, baby, burn! Burn, baby, burn! Let's go in there... together. Burn, baby, burn... There's nobody else here? Not yet, ma'am. I hope this brings you justice. Welcome. I am Warden Glenn Haskins. Those of you here to witness the execution of Jakkariah Dubose Harding. This execution is to take place at midnight, 11 years to the day Harding committed these terrible crimes in October of 1968. The victims, may they rest in peace, 22-year-old Michelle Vaughn, 13-year-old Carly Lee Logan, 18-year-old Beth Ann Studebaker, 39-year-old Marty Dixon, and 22-year-old Lou Ann Newton. State of Alabama sentenced him to death by electric chair. It's customary in this state to let the inmate say a few final words before he leaves this world, but seeing how Harding hasn't spoken a single word since he was arrested, I'm not holding my breath. Let's see. So, do you have anything to say to the victims' families? Just nod your head. Are you sorry for what you've done? I didn't think so. Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn in hell! - Yeah, let him burn! - Burn in hell! Burn! Burn! Die, you bastard. Die! Die! Die! He's dead. Justice's been served. Hear the horn? He's dead! Yeah! He's burning in hell! Lets go break out... Come on! Come on! You're welcome to attend the burial if you can put up with this weather. They're buryin' him tonight? Yes, ma'am. Are there any other guards gonna be there? Well, no, sir. He's dead Are you gonna go to the gravesite? I suppose I should go, too, then. Only on one condition, you're riding with me. Burn in hell! Burn in hell! Burn in hell! Burn in hell! Burn in hell! Burn in hell! Burn in hell! We gotta get to the cemetery. They're holdin' us up, man. Come on, people, get out the way! We're gonna lose them, Ricky Dean. Are you kidding me? Look, get out the way! Come on! Move! Those people make me sick. You mind? No, go ahead. You know, it's really somethin' that we were the only ones there. Not a single family member for Harding. No sister. No brother. No prison wife. Nothin'. They say he was a drifter back in '68. No next of kin. No friends. The man never said one single solitary word. Damn, I have never seen so much fog. There's the hearse right there. I've never seen fog like that. That's not normal. Unfortunately, there's something evil in that fog. Open the glove box. I want you to lock all the doors when I get out. And don't open "em for nobody but me. If I don't come back, Vicki Newton, you get over here in this driver's side and you drive your butt out of here. You're saying that you think he's still alive, aren't you? I know he is. Lock the door. Oh, no. No, no, no, no! Do I need a cigarette? Do I need a cigarette? Uh, you bet your ass, I do. Where are you, you son of a bitch? Show yourself, you monster! Where you at? Ricky Dean! Oh, my God. Ricky Dean? We gotta get him. We gotta get him. We can't get him. We've gotta get you to a hospital. No. Hackleburg.

Well, obviously the voltage wasn't set to a high enough magnitude. Are you kidding me? We've seen that man get electrocuted three damn times, and you're gonna sit there and come up with that sorry excuse? Well, how else would you explain it, Mr. Logan? Electrocuted men don't just get up and walk away. Don't you walk your ass in there and call the proper authorities and the media, and let them know what's comin' in. This is not a media concern. And we will let the authorities know on a need-to-know basis. Well, I tell you this. When I get to Hackleburg, I'll call the media. Well, good luck on your little crusade, Mr. Logan, as long as you keep the media out of this. Because as far as they're concerned, Jack Dubose Harding is resting peacefully, 6 feet under.

Well, how would you like it if I called you Ricky Dean Logan every single time I said somethin' to you, Ricky Dean Logan? How would you like that, Ricky Dean Logan? You know what? I think it'd be quite nice, Vicki Newton. Now, come on, let's go. Let's get out of here. Yeah. Pick something good there, Denver. Yeah.

Yeah. I remember somethin' like that. But did you know, Vicki Newton, I shot him twice with my shotgun? And later on, they come a telling me I shot him with birdshot and not buckshot. That's bullshit, Vicki Newton! It wasn't no birdshot, no way in hell! Well, what are you gettin' at? That I shot him twice with buckshot! He should be dead, but he didn't spend one night in the hospital. Well, if you're trying to tell me something, just say it! Vicki Newton, it's a real possibility that this Jack Harding isn't a man at all. And the state of Alabama knew that all the way back in '68. I... I can't believe that.

And what kind is that? I'll tell you exactly what kind. Hold up. Hold up. Wait. Kinda soothes your soul a little bit. You know what? I just figured out what it was while I was drinkin' my drink. It... it... it was this Church of Christ bumper sticker, wasn't it? I see it. Now, you know, you folk in Cullman don't like Church of Christ. That's it! The whole side of my daddy's family is Church of Christ, I'll have you know. No, that ain't it! We allow them! I know what it is. It's the Alabama-Mobile bumper sticker and you are a Tennessee A&M fan. Tennessee A&M? Hell no! Look at... look at my hat! I'm the biggest Seahawk supporter around here. You can ask anybody. Then sir, I'm strugglin' hard to find out what it could possibly be that you don't like about me, considering we just laid eyes on each other for the first time. I'll tell you exactly what it is that I don't like. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! I know what it is. You think that Trent Thompson should be first string tailback at AMU over my son Lucky Henry. Lucky Henry is your son? Oh, I... I didn't know Lucky Henry was your boy. That... Luck... Lucky Henry is one of my favorite athletes! Well! Then what could it possibly be about me that you don't like, mister? Uh, it uh, I... I... I guess I just mistook you for somebody else. Alright, then. It was good chatting with you, but we gotta hit the road if we're gonna make it down to Mobile before kickoff. You know what that man was tryin' to do when he started talkin' to me, right? Yeah. Complimentin' this damn fine automobile. No. He was complimentin' me. Which in theory, there ain't nothing wrong with that. And I know it ain't the same, but he would've acted just as ugly to me if I hadn't acted kindly to his advances. Newsflash, Vicki Newton. If you had been a black lady, he would've tried to run your ass straight out of town and not back to his bedroom. I know it ain't the same. Still ain't no fun havin' men prey on you like you're some sort of object and then just discard you when you're not interested in what they're after. Hell, since I know where you kept your gun, I... I... I had mind to just whip it out and point it at that son-of-a-bitch. I... I... I might've accidentally shot the fucker and when the cops came in, I would just say, "“Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just a dumb old woman. I didn't know how to use the thing."” Hey, I've done been to one execution. I can't take yours, too! Y'all, I'm gonna need me a nap if I'm gonna be worth a darn tonight. Oh, yeah, I could go for a nap. He only has eyes for Bronco Burger waitresses. Well, I don't wanna sleep with you. Just nap. There is a big dang difference. Okay. It's okay. I could nap. Well, come on in, Neddy Teddy. I'll nap with you any old day. Denver, nap time. Nap time. Nap time. Nap time. Nap time. Nap time. Well, I ain't even tired! Denver, babe, my nose hurts just lookin' at you. You know, sleep is just as important as water, which I haven't seen you drink at all since we've been here. All I'm sayin' is that maybe you might need... Meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow. Meow. Meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow... What the fuck? Meow. Alright, nap time. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

I knew you'd like this place. - Yeah. - Glad we came. Um, excuse me, I'm lookin' for the sheriff. He's right over there. Sheriff? Well, I reckon you could say that. I've been called much worse. Sheriff Toliver Shanks. Ricky Dean Logan. This here is Vicki Newton. What can I do for you folks today? Well, we're gonna need to sit down for this one. Oh, please. I see you uh, heard about the execution? Yep, read all about it. Uh, said it went off without a hitch. Said the Yellow Mama took Harding out of this world. I'm sorry, but we have some really disheartenin' news to tell you. Well, howdy, y'all, welcome to Bronco Burger. My name's Heather and I'll be your cowpoke today. Our house special includes the Buckin' Bronc' combo with Bronco Soda and Stallion Fries. If that don't interest you, I can get you some menus out here. I am starvin'. Well, well um, get us two of the house specials. And can you get us some Coca Colas instead of whatever else that was you said. You got it. Comin' right up. Can I get you anything else, Sheriff? I'm good for now, hon. Alrighty. Sheriff Shanks, we were at that execution last night. And despite of what you might be readin' in that paper, that monster's still walkin' this Earth. And I believe he's right here in Hackleburg. Last night, he got up out of his coffin, and he killed three people, and broke my goddamn hand. It's true. I saw it with my own two eyes. He stole that hearse that they were carryin' his body in and he took off in it. Oh, man. Y'all pullin' old Sheriff Shanks' leg, aren't you? Who put you up to this? Sheriff Craven over in Sonoma? Dammit, Sheriff! This is the real deal! Two Coca Colas. Thanks, hon. Y'all seriously expect me to believe that old Jakkariah Harding took a ride on the Yellow Mama, and then just dusted hisself off, and walked right out of his own damn grave? Don't call him by that name. This isn't is a man, Sheriff Shanks. This is a monster! Listen, if Dracula name was Phillip Tankersley, you wouldn't say, "“There goes Phillip, drinkin' some blood."” Nobody's ever seen Wolfman running at him and said, "Oh, hey. there goes old Larry Talbot." Do you believe in Wolfman and Dracula? Ricky Dean, just take a sip of soda. Sheriff, look, I know it sounds crazy. And I... I wouldn't have believed it either. But I did see it. Ricky Dean is lucky to be alive. What does it hurt if you would just believe us? I reckon it wouldn't do no harm to contact my boys and tell them to keep their eyes on the lookout for old black hearse.

Okay, daddy, don't get upset with me, but I kind of sort of made other plans tonight. Other plans with who? A boy named John Paul. Oh. Right. John Paul. Do... do I know John Paul? Oh, I just met him today at work. You sure that's wise? I mean, he... He could be Ted Bundy. Right? Daddy. I'm just saying. John Paul? Well, he's real nice. I think you'd like him. And it's just gonna be a group thing. We're just gonna watch the game with him and his friends. Are you... are you asking? No, Daddy, I'm... I'm telling you. Fair enough. All right. Then it's me and Mr. Bones today. I'm sure he'll bring us good luck. I'm sure he will, Daddy. Nothing over here. Anything on your side? No. But when I see something, you"ll be the first one to know, Vicki Newton. Alabama and Tennessee, there is none bigger than this. If you're from Alabama, you're Mobile golden and green. All right, boys, come on! Come on! Let's see some action. I know, I need a win. I would like to introduce y'all to Count War Damn Deeter! I'm kidding, Bobbi Jo. I'm... God, lighten up. It's a game, come on. Oh, hey, that must be Heather. Oh. - How do I look? - Groovy. I look all right. I dig it. Shoes. There's my boy, look. Hey. Did you have any trouble finding the place? No, no. I really liked your driveway. Oh. Uh, thanks. Uncle Deeter is thinking about having it paved, so. Oh, yeah. He should... He should do that. Yeah. Uh, by the way, Uncle Deeter is quite a character. So, I just kinda wanna give you a heads up on that. Hey, everybody, this is Heather. Heather, this is the gang. Hey, girl. Come, sit down. Milton Deeter, my dear. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Bobbi Jo, Milton's girlfriend. Yes. And Bobbi Jo and I are retiring to our room for the evening. Oh, no, come on, Deets, hang out. It's a party. It's your house. I guess we could sit for a spell. Hey, kid, still got any of that coke? Sure do. Right here. Right answer to the right question. It's in this little box here. Perfect. Perfect. Ooh, yeah. Oh yeah. I do not have any Pepsi to offer you, my dear. But would you like some coke? Uh... You ain't got to do anything that you don't wanna, you hear? Uh, reckon I'll just hold off for now. At least till I make sure y'all aren't a bunch of Ted Bundys. Cute and wise. Huh. Shit, guys. Where's Denver? She's probably down at the swimming hole. That's one complicated girl. Still trying to wrap my mind around the many interwoven layers to which she possesses. Well, you know, personally, I think she's a damn idiot. - Hey. - But, hey, I like damn idiots. Hey! I'm a damn idiot. Me too. Me too. Well, I know that Neddy Teddy, Pam the Glam. You ain't got to tell me. Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Ugh, shit! We"re off and running. Meow! Meow! - Meow! Meow! Meow! - Meow! Meow! Meow! - Meow! Meow! - Meow! Meow! - Meow! Meow! Meow! - Meow! Meow! Meow! Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof! Bobbi Jo! What? Stop that. You're embarrassing me. I'm tired tonight, gang. You need to get some shut eye? I can't get enough of it these days, I swear. You see that cut? Oh, yeah? What'd you do to yourself? Nothing. When I woke up from my nap, I was bleeding profusely. Well, hell, Uncle Deeter. You must have done something. Napping, my boy? Merely napping. Unexplainable things happen in this house. Unexplainable things to which you will become accustomed if you stay long enough. Come, my lady. We will now retire to our room. Bye, Heather. War damn Seahawk! - War damn Seahawk! - War damn Seahawk! I think I wanna rouse Denver. I'm getting worried. Man, she's fine. She's a grown woman. Just watch the game. Uh, I don't know. I'm getting concerned. Denver! Come on, look, go, go, go, go, go! Yes! Oh! - Woah! - That's what I"m talking about. Best game we're playing. Denver, you up there? Denver. It's Neddy. Where are you? Denver? Hello. Denver? - Yes, yes, yes! - Yes! Oh my gosh! I knew. I told you! That's good, that's good. Oh, geez, Denver. Where are you? Denver, you down here? Surely you're not down here, Denver. Denver. It's Neddy. Hello? Denver? What the hell is that? John Paul. This house is haunted, man! Oh, yeah. You got ghost. Chinese checker-playing ghost. Denver? Seahawks on the prowl tonight! Come on! Hey! At this rate, it's gonna take a week to find that hearse. That's if he's even out there. I have no doubt he's out there, Vicki Newton. We just haven't been looking in all the right places just yet. But he'll show up. I'm telling you. Welcome to Bronco Burger. I'm Amy. I'll be your cowpoke tonight. Um, we have a few specials. Hey, just give us two Coca-Colas, please. - Two? - Oh, and hey, where's the lady's room? Oh, just around the corner. Who wants a deluxe Bronco Burger? - Me. - Me. Well, guess who's not getting jack crap? Not at least till you tell me the God"s honest truth about what really happened today. But mom, we've already told you this story like, 50 bajillion times. Yeah. He looked like this. You told me the same lie 50 bajillion times. I don't want to hear any more bullshit about a monster man in a hearse. I want to hear the real reason you ended up at that hospital all damn day. - Ma'am, did you say hearse? - Yes, I did. Ricky Dean, get your ass over here. Come on! Come on! Come on! Where are you? Stop him! What are you doing? Get... get there! What is going... come on, y'all! Come on! Why are we playing like this today? C... catch him! Uh, say, you wanna take a little walk? There's a nice little path out back. I thought I was here to watch the game. Oh, well, I mean, it's... You know, it's pretty stressful. Maybe it we'd benefit from stretching our legs a little bit and getting some fresh air. Hmm. Maybe at half time. Yeah, half time. Oh, sack him! - What is this? - Yes! - Yes! - Yeah! We'll return to Biford Griffin Stadium after this commercial break. Howdy Hackleburgians, it's your old pal Hank lettin' ya know about a very special sale we got goin' on this weekend. All weekend long is our Christmas on the Third Saturday in October weekend sale. Tell me, what do you make of that man there? Hank or Hank's Good Stuff. I don't know. Seems like a real strong guy. Kind of sexy. Bobbi Jo, that man does not care one iota for the company of a woman. Really? - We're cheap! - We're cheap! - And we've been naughty! - And we've been naughty! And garsh, so have I! Could've fooled me with all those floozies around him. It's all a ruse. He desperately wants to appear masculine in order to fit in to the social structure of Hackleburg. Well, aren't you the smartest thing? Kind of like when you told me about those little boys wanting to diddle their mamas. Oedipus complex. Go on. Yeah, you said the little boys wanted to kill their daddies and have their mamas all to themselves. You do listen to me. Of course I do. That's how I know I got me an Electra complex. That doesn't scare me at all. Cause I get to live it out through you. Oh. You're not thinking about jock straps anymore, are you? Maybe after the game we turn the lights down. Watch a Fellini flick or something? Yeah. That sounds great. Hold that thought while I go slip on something more comfortable. Happy third Saturday in October. Dracula, a love story of horrific proportions introducing... It won't take long. I'll only miss a couple of series. Found in Transylvania's infamous resident, Green Dracula. Baby! I think I need your help in here. I seemed to have misplaced my clothes. Well, hold on one second, baby. I'll be there soon. Bobbi Jo, you get in here. Now, baby. I said I'll be there in a minute. Be patient. Baby, you better hurry. The time is nigh. Bobby Jo. You need to calm down in there. Don't finish before I get in there. I hope you're ready for me. What are you doing in here? My butt shaking like I said it would, babe. You're not even gonna look at me? Okay. Well, I guess you're playing hard to get. Just how hard are you? Just like I like it. Oh my God! Coach Redd, you're winning the game by a touchdown, but Tennessee A&M came awfully close to tying it up after that last drive. What do you need to do to slow "em down? We're lucky to be in the ball game right now. I'll tell you what, the boys are playing like a steaming pile of dog shit, pardon my French. If we don't start playing some Mobile football in the second half, we're gonna get our asses handed to us. Mm. He's right. They're gonna get killed if they keep playing like this. It's "cause I'm not watching the game with my daddy. It's bad luck if we don't watch it together. John Paul, you better tell your friend to take her ass home. I cannot take the loss to A&M tonight. Hey, I'll go down there and whoop Coach Redd myself if we get beat. Perfect time for a walk, I say. All right. Walk never hurt nobody, I reckon. - Hmm. - Man, this party is a drag. Where the hell is everybody? You don't think Denver and Ned. Dancing Denver and Neddy the teddy? Hey, I don't know. They're both pretty far out. I'm just saying. Mmm. No. Yep. Right. Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow, meow! Meow, meow, meow! - Meow. - Meow, meow, meow! We'll be back. All right. Don't get lost. I got that... Mm. Dancing Denver and Neddy the teddy. Ugh. Maybe in his wildest dreams. How close are we, Vicki Newton? It looks like we still have a good 10 miles to go. Ten miles? Damn! We should have called Sheriff Shanks before we drove on out of there. No. Everything we need to handle that monster is in the trunk of this car. When I get him on the ground, you just be ready with what's in the trunk. Can't stay out here too long. I want to finish watching that football game. No, we're just gonna stretch our legs a little bit. So you didn't uh, grow up here? No, but I spent a lot of time here. You know, I'm sure shocked that we ain't never met before. Well, I'm sure glad you walked into my Bronco Burger today. Yeah, I am, too. You know, I think there was something in those Bronco sodas. Well, yeah. I mean, I really liked their odds this year. I mean, I think they're gonna repeat. Yeah, but their defense isn't as great as it was last year. Well, yeah. Hey, John Paul. What's that? Dang. Where did that come from? It's a hearse. Well, I know that. I just don't know where it came from. It's not y'alls? I've never seen it before in my life. I was warned today about a hearse. I was told if I saw one, I should steer clear of it. What, you're superstitious? I left my keys inside. I thi... I think I ought to grab them and go. Hey, listen, I'll ask the gang if they know about it. Uh, we'll figure this out. These folks, they... They came into Bronco Burger today. They're the ones that warned me. They... they were talking about that... That killer that got executed. Jakkariah Harding. Yeah, he's dead. You think he's got something to do with this hearse? And broke my goddamn hand. What did he say before that? Huh? Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, can you just explain to me what's going on? Why are all the lights off? Oh, there ain't no tellin'. Well, hey, it's probably just a fuse or something. We'll get in here and switch that fuse out. We'll be watching the game in no time, all right? Nothing to worry about. What? Hey, they're probably just goofing off in here or something. Oh, they're just joking. Hey, why y'all sitting in the dark? Seriously, what's going on, y'all? John Paul, get away from there! Joke's over. Wake up, everybody. Hey, everybody, wake up. Hey! Hey, monster, remember me? Vicki Newton, Vicki Newton get your ass in here. Oh my God. Ah, oh my God. Heather? Bronco Burger Heather? Hey, hey, hey, Vicki Newton here. Vicki Newton here. Everything is gonna be okay. All right, hon? Nightmare is over. It's over! It's over. The nightmare is over. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. It's all right. It's all right. Hey, hey, it's all right. Come on. Sit down. Come on. It's all right. This is what you deserve, motherfucker! It"s a goddamn nightmare in there. Come on back here, Ricky Dean. I wanna go home. I wanna see my daddy. No, no, hon. You need to stay here. The cops are gonna want to talk to you. Tomorrow. Let her go home. To be with her daddy. She's one of the lucky ones. Hey, hey, come on. You're all right? We're together now come on. It's all right. [] It's been a long night. But at least we did one thing that's right. Hey, you did what you came here to do. You got him. After all this time, you got him. I'm gonna go call the law. ♪ Ooh, shopping at night ♪ ♪ Shadows rise ♪♪ Come on down to Hank's Good Stuff... Ricky Dean! He's in the damn car! How do you know? I just know it, Vicki Newton! I know it! I can feel it! Then she's dead already. No. He's just using her to get away. He's going where she's going and then he's gonna kill her, so he could throw it in my damn face. - Think, um... - Think, think. How can we find her? - You remember her name? - Heather. But I don't know her last name. - But... - Come on, come on! She works at the Bronco Burger. That's it, that's it. You're welcome so much. Bronco Burger. This is Amy. This is gonna be a very weird conversation. But I just need you to go with it and not ask any questions. Okay. You know the girl who works the day shift, Heather? Yeah, you're talking about Heather Hill. Hill? Okay, good. Good. Uh, where does Heather Hill live? Um, I'm not sure I'm supposed to be giving out that kind of information. If you don't tell me where Heather Hill lives, she's as good as dead. Um, excuse me, who here knows where Heather Hill lives? Who wants to know? Anybody? I'm sorry, lady. Nobody here knows where Heather Hill lives. Damn it. Nobody knows where she lives. Okay, I got an idea. Call Bronco Burger back, Vicki Newton. Call "em back! Bronco Burger. Yes, um, I'm doing a follow-up question on Heather Hill. Hey, is this some kind of a joke? Listen, I just need you to ask everyone there. Does anyone know who Heather Hill's daddy is? Y'all know who Heather Hill's daddy is? You're talking about old Barry Hill. Yeah, I know that son-of-a-bitch, good old boy. His name is Barry Hill. Look in that damn phone book and find Barry Hill. Daddy? Daddy? And you're right, partner, this is the moment of truth. They can take their first lead of the night With a touchdown on this drive, but if you're gonna make it happen, you better do it now. If he's gonna take the ball himself on a QB keeper, this is what makes the thunder and lightning approach of Alabama Mobile's running game's so tough to defend. Gotta give all credit... Patrick pitches to Lucky Henry and here he goes. Oh! What a move to stay on his feet. Here goes Lucky breaking away now and he's gonna barrel down to his own 35 yard line. Listen to this crowd come to life. - War damn Seahawk. - War damn Seahawk. Oh, come on now. - Hey, old timer. - Howdy, Barry. Hey, you know uh, Bethany? Oh, Bethany, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Thank you. Got quite a game going on, don't we? Oh, you tell me. Whew! You know, you mighty popular around here tonight. How's that? Somebody called up here asking about you. And your daughter. Do what now? Yeah, some folks called up here saying Heather Hill was as good as dead. I don't know. I couldn't make any sense of it. They say who they were? I didn't get any names. Look, order something, anything you want now. I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - I gotta check on my daughter. Good luck, Barry. Yeah. I'm real lucky. Heather Hill! Yes? Ricky Dean Logan here. I don't need you to ask me any questions. I just need you to do what I fucking tell you to do, okay, sweetheart? Okay. Get your ass out the goddamn house now! No! No. No! No! No, no! No! No! No! No! No! No, no! Heather? Meet my daddy, motherfucker! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Heather, the gun case! I don't know the combination. 15-48-91! Ugh, damn! Okay, okay. Son of a bitch. Daddy! Get up! Get up! Get out of my house! Stay behind me, sweetie. You're just gonna have to trust me, Daddy. Shoot him! I trust you, honey! Shoot him! Shoot him again! What the hell? Get out of the house. I know you think he's dead, Daddy, but you gotta watch him. Barry! Where the hell is he? He's in there on the floor and he's dead. Thank God! Oh God! You're okay. Heather, what happened? My daddy. He saved me. Of course. That's what daddies are for. Hey, that son-of-a-bitch is gone. I mean, virtually vanished. Don't be concerned though. He can't get too far. I'm on his trail. I want y'all to meet my daddy. Hey, Daddy. These are the people that helped saved me tonight. Barry Hill. Pleasure to meet you. Ricky Dean Logan, sir. And that's my friend, Vicki Newton. Barry. Ms. Newton. I want to thank y'all for looking out for my little girl. Yeah. You got something special there, sir. I think so. Did I hear him say that that man in there got up and left? How is that possible? He isn't a man. He's a monster. Mr. Hill, I got a story to tell you, if you got time to listen. It's been a long night. I wish somebody would tell me what the hell is going on around here.
