[silence] [splat] [John]: If you asked me just a week ago, I would've said this-- there's two different ways to be gay. Option one: gay sex. With all the multiple moist pleasures squeezed from juicy exotic tastes... it was a lot of work, and tons of clean-up. I mean, don't get me wrong-- fruit had its moments. But with gay sex, what, 1,000 times a year and counting, I was feeling-- I was feeling independent. My name is John Jardine, and, at 25, I'm looking for some sort of meaning to all this, some romance, someone to see me as... well, me. And not as some rich, gay slut/whore who gets everything he wants. [groans and climaxes] [gasps] [♪♪♪] But let's face it-- what was the alternative? Some fairy-tale perfection called option number two-- &quot;Gay Love.&quot; [♪♪♪] Hey, John! Your Mommy here! Jean Philippe? [shrieking] Through the years, I kept trying to believe in this sort of storybook happy times, but deep down, I was always thinking that a typical &quot;one-and-only&quot; would just never be my thing. Seriously, I was having nightmares. Couples taking walks together down cute little sunshine streets. Houses in pastel. Two-and-a-half dogs-- I mean, really... it's just so not me. Like, what's happening to my sanity? Three boys, legal age, chasing me. Why the fuck would I run? I mean, how does anyone fall for just one guy? Like, even if you're straight, bi, curious, whatever-- don't we all just wanna have fun? But I have to admit, with finding love, and, you know, dating-- I'd say it smacked me right in the face. [♪♪♪] No one knew I wanted it bad, but the &quot;it&quot; I wanted was nothing like what I expected. Jack! Jack! -See? -Jack! Tortured by gay love. Does this look happy to you? But how about this? [groaning]: That's it-- That's it. Oh! Oh-- See? This was last week. That is this week. Last week. This week. Gay sex and gay love coming together. A miracle. 'Cause just a week ago... this was me. [groans] [intercom buzzes]: Uh, John, your dad-- Kiddo! What? There's time for work and there's time for titties-- I'm not paying for both. Yeah, but-- Not on company time, and certainly not inside our building, is that clear? Dad. Can we talk later? Michel called. Someone broke into the kitchen, destroyed the place by cooking. Break, enter, and cook-- can you believe it? Think it was a competitor? No. Uh... yeah! Listen, look into it. I don't care if there's a dead animal under your desk, you're on payroll. -Dad, I'm trying. -Do you ever work? -This morning, I was-- We'll talk. When you have time. By the way, Vivienne called. Can you believe it? After 10 years, family reunion. Tomorrow, lunch, at the restaurant. Your restaurant. Dad. [door shuts] Shit! Titty? Dead animal? You like? Marco can make happen. [Marco giggles] What happened here? It's like Julia Child exploded. Hi. [Michel]: Monsieur? I thought your father was coming. I'm here. Yes, uh, we did not touch anything, for fear of the fingerprints. Should we call the police? Whoa. No. It was me. I was here. Earlier. There was a motivational workshop and it said that you should try new things, so I thought, you know, why not try cooking? It's cool. I'll sign you guys up. Ah, absolument. Oh, how exciting. How mind-expanding. Well, I, for one, cannot wait to see what you create. What, your private jet's being hand-washed? I don't have a private-- Ha. Mm. It's been a long time. Yeah. You never cooked before? No. Why would I? Right. You got a point. What, 16 restaurants now? You were trying to cook some sort of quail? Back to the basics. Works better sometimes. Reasons why certain flavors go well together. Isn't that boring? What? Apples. Monsieur Jardine? Yes? Welcome to Jardine's. You want to try something? [♪♪♪] Cut the chicken up like this-- around the bone-- Are you watching? Okay. Okay. [♪♪♪] Wow. Colorful. Thanks. We're French cuisine. 'Course, but I was thinking-- You work here, and you cook like that? You didn't know I work here? Or you didn't know I cooked? Uh, both. Been with the company eight years, started at &quot;Bistro on Denman,&quot; but just got promoted here. You didn't know? No. J'excuse. Uh... Should I, uh...? No. No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Stay. What's-his-face here is just showing me some sort of tempura/teriyaki... some sort of Asian thing. What is your name again? What? Your name. You're kidding. Buddy. Come on. I mean, it's been, like, how long? I don't even remember-- Ow! Mother--! &quot;What's-his-face&quot;? [exhaling deeply] Jack. Jack. Why are you even here? What is this? You're showing me what you do. This? This-- this is your flagship 5-star restaurant, Johnny. You wanna fool around, go &quot;Rachael Ray&quot; your other fucking kitchens. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sor--! He's the best line cook in town, monsieur. Please don't-- Fire him! Do it! [splat] After he cleans. [♪♪♪] Oh, wow. Looks worse than yesterday, eh? Prick. You okay? [grunts] Ahh! I know what you want. Ten bucks for looking, stud. Yeah, no. [♪♪♪] [Marco giggling] Uh... -Hey. -[intercom buzzes] -Visitor, John. Sorry, I-- - Your dad's busy. Should I call security? We're good, Candice. Thanks. Do we have an appointment? Johnny... Come on. You can't fire me over the-- Look, I'm sorry about-- about the whole... You get your job back. Grab a club, take a swing. Marco, two coffees. [Marco huffs] Okay. It's there for a reason, Jack. Right. Look, I know Jardine's is French, but I've been cooking the same-- but wonderfully successful cuisine-- for, like, eight years. Mm, eight years? Right. People want to see fresh ideas, local ingredients. I could really go for a career push-- -'Cause next month, I-- -No. What? I just hired you back, Jack. You make good coin. Great way to live. Don't think so much. Alright. I'll wait for your dad, then. Was that a threat? People know you as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; sometimes, which is really great for business, but creatively... Marco. Massage? No. Cream. He's been here for a week now. It's not rocket science. I don't want cream. You want better hours. -I don't. -Right? No. Johnny, please. I'm going nuts. Carrots, tomatoes, zucchinis-- same stuff over and over again. It's boring. I'm begging you, please, just take a look. New recipes. I need a life-change, and I know you want to step out from your dad's shadow. Anyways, the thing is, you're not that good with the food. Good with the numbers, I think, but... Huh. That's why I'm here. I'm here to help. What the hell was that? What? What do you mean, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; You kissed me. Well, I'm not attracted to you. I'm playing around, Jack. I'll think about it. What, the last 20 years? The recipes. I'll get back to you. But it might take me a while, because I'm not that talented. Johnny. I-- I didn't mean-- Right. Go for drinks, maybe? Tomorrow? Uh... uh, yeah. Drinks. Uh, tomorrow. I know you're a busy guy, so-- I'm not busy. Ay! Ah! You crazy. This, buy from Prada! [♪♪♪] Hey. Hi. [♪♪♪] Meow! Welcome to Marco Chow Experience. Marco, please. [♪♪♪] Meow! Born rich, man. Sometimes, they forget to touch people. [♪♪♪] [spazzing out] [♪♪♪] [phone chimes] [Marco groaning and giggling] Get up. Marco, would you just stop? Would you move? [Marco grunts bitterly] Johnny, what happen? Shit. I gotta go. No. My sister is talking to Mom and Dad for the first time in, like, 10 years. No... don't go. It's a-- it's a big deal, Marco! Big deal right here. Just stop it! Don't touch me. Okay, okay. I stop touch. Marco come with lunch? Stop! Would you just... go? Home. Please. What? I'm sorry, you're just-- you're not right for the job. It's too much work to have to tell you what to do. You tell me anything. I can do. Your daddy-- he not know you gay? You think you're the first genius to come up with that? Be gone by the time I get back. No one fuck with Marco Chow! Great to see you guys. Been looking forward to this lunch. Us too, yes. You look gorgeous today, my dear. Thanks, Dad. Good to see you. So, it's a nice little lunch. What? Hi. Hi. What happened to your head? Hello, sis. What's going on? How long's it been? A while. Dad? You told him? I thought it was a reunion. I thought he should come. As long as his schedule permitted. -Sweetie, would you-- -Come back later, please. Jack Gaang-- are you that movie star from Hong Kong? No, he's our Oriental neighbor from the old house. In Kitsilano. &quot;Asian,&quot; Mom. He's &quot;Asian.&quot; He's not the buffet at the Red Chili Szechuan, sweetheart, he's an Oriental person. -No, he is-- -Oh, my God. You tell her. No. Go right ahead. [clink-clink] Hello? Hi. Guys, um, this might seem a little... well, out of the blue, but, well... We're getting married. I beg your pardon? Who's getting married? Jack and I. We've been in love for a while, so it's... That's not &quot;out of the blue&quot;. You're completely out of your mind. You! You-- You... are not invited and may not speak. You say what you want all the time. You never think about anyone else. I don't want to hear it. Believe me, I'm thinking about you right now. We would love for you to come to the wedding, and I was thinking that you could offer him a, um... promotion. A what? We would love to buy a house someday, so, you know... He works for us? Sorry, you work for us? Yes, sir. Since-- He's a line cook. Here. Do you mind? Vivienne! Yes, Mother. I am marrying a chef. A low-income kid who grew up in a duplex. God, Mom. You're a snob. A classist snob. Why do you think I ran away? Kiddo! Slow down now. [♪♪♪] Look-- Mom, I'm happy to be here. You look beautiful. Listen to me. For years, I thought this Oriental man-- Asian, Mom. He's Asian. ...Kidnapped you. Worried all day and all night, whether you were killed by a triad with a name I can't pronounce! -Triad? -He's not in a triad! ...Then, on a Friday, when you know I have my facials, you drop this on us! -Stop it! -What? [thud] Our meeting with Dr. Cheval, is that next week? Viv, you're delusional. Shut up. Thank me later. Mr. Jardine-- Ahem. Mom. Dad. I'm gay. What? You just have to make this about you, don't you? Sir, the guests. You know what? I'm not keeping it down anymore, you know why? Because I'm gay. I have always been gay, and I always will be gay. There are gays everywhere, people. I mean, I live in Yaletown. Hello! It's the gayest place on Earth. -Just look at-- -Get a hold of yourself! -[glass breaking] -Johnny! It's not the 1900s anymore. No one cares. Please, it's okay. Your mom ignores it and I just humor you. You've always played this &quot;Lady's Man.&quot; That's why we never talked about it. But, kiddo... you're as queer as they come. -Please! -Everyone knows. No, they don't. I know. No duh. I slept with you. Not just him, Johnny. Facebook, Twitter... Everywhere. Here, let me show you. -Dad. Please. -Renard, sit. Show of hands, please, everyone. You're all here at Jardine's today. You know who owns it? Excellent! Thank you. Now, who here knew that &quot;John Jardine,&quot; that spoiled French kid who anglicized his name 'cause he didn't like being called &quot;Jean,&quot; like a girl, who knew that John Jardine was gay? Everyone! Thank you. Mystery solved. No one cares. Well, I do. It's your issue, honey. Not his. Now, listen to me. Your preference for dangly bits aside-- what should this really be about? What do you want? You know what? I need my own life. You and Mom had everything laid out for me, and I mean, thank you, for the &quot;leg up&quot; and all, but there has to be more to life than just gay bars and fine dining. I mean, that's all I do, and that's all people see. It's, like, I've got a goddamn &quot;John Jardine&quot; T-shirt on, and yet nobody knows anything about me. Solutions, kiddo. Quit masturbating on the problems. Let's eat. [Monique]: Renard. &quot;Masticating.&quot; Sorry, honey. Perrier and lemon. And he will not be staying. -Right away. -Dad, I'm not done. We know that. Johnny, go somewhere else, figure it out. We're here for Vivienne and Jack today. Forget the Perrier. Champagne. Very good, sir. Credit cards, Johnny. Put 'em on the table. You want your own life? You can handle being fired. [laughs] What? You heard me. Did he hear me? Don't be cruel. No, you know what? I can do better. Here. Take that. So, how long have you been with Jardine's? Uh-- I recall a delightful-- How is your Mother? She's-- She's well, yeah. Congratulations, Jack, buddy. Good luck with the wedding. Well... Wonder what we'll have today. What would you like to start with? [♪♪♪] No, I don't eat meat. -You're looking well. -I'm vegetarian. Thank you! I know some great asparagus dishes. Excuse me? Asparagus? I tell you people family secret. Great. Which one? John Jardine is gay! Ah. [laughing] What? You not believe? You missed the train, cutie. Miss train? No. I from Shenzhen, China. I fly. Train not come from China, go Canada. Weren't you under his desk? Honey. How about suing for sexual harassment? Yes! I can sue! No, no, no. Silly. I'll give you a much better deal, trust me. Oh, thanks. Hey! What are you doing? That costs money. I'll pay for it. Please. Don't fire me. He was eating garbage before. Wait. Can you still fire me? I could rat you out. Or you could... you know. Text me. We'll discuss your penance over dinner. I texted you all week, John Jardine. You never text back. Joe, come on. It's not my name, John. G.F.Y. What kind of name is G.F.Y.? Go fuck yourself. &quot;G.F.Y.&quot; [♪♪♪] [Monique]: What is this? [Renard]: Ah, nicely plated. [Monique]: That's about it. You can start, Dad. Okay. John. Can I talk to you? Uh, no. No. I'm talking to you. Why are you marrying Viv? We're best friends. I didn't even know you guys kept in touch. Your point? She's got emotional problems, Jack! -She doesn't need marriage. -You make shit up. I'm not. Look. You don't have to marry into the family to get your recipes looked at. Are you completely blind? We've been living together for forever. If you talked to her once in a while, you would've known. We have talked. Yeah, all the time-- like, once a year. And you only talk about you. You are screwing with your life! Whatever. We're in our 20s, party age. You can't tell me kissing me didn't mean anything. You looked like you needed it. You kissed me back. It was awesome. Really the best. I needed you to kiss me? Well, yeah. Lady Gaga fingering her fans. There. You see? Gaga reference. You can't be straight. No way. Who do you think you are? You now know me all of a sudden? Yesterday, you blanked on my name. I love her. It's about commitment and family, not sex. Marriage without sex? Vivienne have a say? You're a sex-without- marriage robot. What's the difference? Sex without-- What is this, the 1950s? I need business advice. Last time I checked, you're out of a job. Plenty of time to read. Jack... I didn't throw this out the window. It was an accident. -Whatever. -No, not whatever! You keep having this delusion I'm some heartless prick. I'm totally generous, I swear. I'm thinking partnership, John, not charity. That's not what I meant. I'll read every word. I promise. Weren't you, like, having lunch? I went to the men's room. You owe me drinks, and dinner to talk about recipes. Yeah. Whatever. [♪♪♪] Afternoon, Mr. Jardine. Hey... Bruce? Yeah. Alright. I'm Bruce. [♪♪♪] There something wrong with the elevator? Oh, it's on strike again, eh? Maybe they want a raise, 'cause it's a-- An elevator? See your card, sir? Call me John. Sure. [spits] I didn't think of that. [phone rings] Ah. Security. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. Can't let you in the building, sir. What? Sorry, sir, you're gonna have to deal with the office directly. Stop fooling around, Bruce. Just need to grab a few things. [phone beeps] Sir, that's not for the public's-- Yeah, it's an emergency. Hold on. Call me John. I told you. -[phone rings] -Right. [beep] Yes? My key card won't work and my phone's busted. Who's this? Dad, it's me. [beep] Dad? [dial tone buzzing] Dad? [♪♪♪] [rattling securely] What? [thumps] Yes? Ah. Hello! Get out. No. Now is Marco Chow home. Present from your daddy. He say you not come in. Marco! You're on a visa. You're E.S.L. You can't even work in this country, let alone-- That's my shirt. No. Alright, I get it. Thank Dad for the life lesson, just-- No, no, no, no, no! I am boss now. You should put out, for me put in. Shut up and listen. You're not that original. I walk around with dollar signs on my face. Just... Alright. You win today. You can take the condo. Just go back to school, okay? Work on your English, at least. -Marco! -Marco? We &quot;twistering&quot; yet? No. John think to success in life, must improve English first. Oh. It's not about English, it's-- Shouldn't you guys be at work? We're on a break. Education is important, Marco. Okay, lesson learnt. Why talk good when you look like you? Boxers or briefs? Don't remember. Briefs. Brand? Calvins. Mm, so last season. Guys, come on. You know the saying. It's what's inside that counts. Embarrassing. -What? Guys-- -Bye-bye. [slam] Look, a promotion just isn't my thing. I want my own kitchen. I know! But you don't get your own restaurant just by working hard. Do you know how much money it takes? A million, to start a business. That's why we need Mom and Dad. You've got talent, Jack, but you can't just hide in your food. I'll work overtime. Ugh, not the point. Look. I hear you. Being back with your family's not exactly creme brulee, but I appreciate it. Good. So, where does John fit in? What? You talked to him today, right? Why? What happened? Happened? What... He's giving me advice. You're lying. You're doing that thing you do when you lie. What thing? You open your eyes really big. Vivienne, why would I lie? I don't know. Why would you? It's nothing. I saw him at work last week. Still lying. I went to show him my recipes to catch a break legitimately. [sighs heavily] Okay, not lying, but hurtful. It's not legitimate to ask your father-in-law, who actually knows about food, for a job? You'd rather ask some good-for-nothing playboy who pretends to be your boss? I don't think he's as bad as people think-- Hey, Dad. Hey, Oli. Uh, heads up. Sorry. We back early. He not like High School Musical. But you lied. Mom, she lied. You said we'd watch basketball. Singing about it isn't the same. Ma, do you mind taking him inside? Viv and I need to have a talk about why she thinks I'm having second doubts about our marriage. [scoffs] Wrong. I'm not the one thinking. Grab the ball, Oli. Let's go. What you mean, &quot;marriage&quot;? Ma... I was gonna-- You get married, you not tell me? This is good fortune. Big news! Ma, don't yell. Ow. I not yell. I ask. You two have so many big secret, why you not tell me that you have wedding? I need to-- Oh. Dinner? Crash for the night maybe? I am sorry, Monsieur. Strict orders. You are no longer part of the family. I know you like my condo. Have a party there, go nuts. Your father changed the locks, Monsieur. These keys no longer work. [locks snapping shut] Is there anything else I should know? I sat on a golf ball once, had to have it removed. Jack... My dad left before I was born so I have no idea what he looks like. Nor do I care. I know. Okay, listen... John pushed me off the tree fort when we were nine. But we never talked about it because, well, he started ignoring me, so whatever. I'm over it. What else do you want to know? Are you in love with him? Jack? Are you-- Love's relative, Viv. Who cares? What? I care! I'm not in love with him. Viv, I'm not in love with him! Lying. Sorry, you mind cooking for once, Viv? Thanks. You deserve to suffer, but I can't stand anyone eating garbage. Sorry about giving you a hard time today. I might have deserved it. Join me for that dinner now? Funeral or fashion? Performance artist. Like what? Like a mime? [chuckles] No. A beat poet. You're shitting me? Why? That didn't take long. Wait. I'm sorry, that's great. Good for you. Don't patronize me, John. I know you can't imagine any of us with a brain or a personality. That's not true. I just-- we just, um... we just never got around to it. Yeah, second dates aren't your thing. I'm sorry I didn't text back. I'm sure you're really interesting. Oh, man. Really interesting for an incredibly hot, really easy waiter. Man, you are such a dick. Being hot doesn't exclude having a purpose, you know. Yeah. I'm starting to get that. You have a place to sleep tonight? And, no, that's not a come-on. I do mean sleep. I have a couch. I'll be fine. Okay. Well... good luck. My name's Paul. In case you were wondering, at all. Try not to be such an asshole all the time. See you around. [♪♪♪] Ready, kiddo? Yup. Hi. [sighing] What? How do you know where we live? Your fiance works for us, remember? Hi. Oliver. I am your Uncle John. I've heard a lot about you. Well, I'm sorry we didn't meet sooner. What is going on? Mom's sick of Dad's cooking. Oli! Viv! You told me that Oli's Dad was some... really awesome dude from some really classy-- John! You know that Jack is Oli's Father. Please. I'm not gonna tell you my secrets! Everyone says I look like my Dad. Okay. You do. You have a dad. Great! We're moving out, John. Jack and I, it's over. He finally told you? Oli... Can you get a cab? But I have to go to the bathroom. No. You just went. But the doctor said whenever I want-- Oli, find a cab, now. [grumbles] Go. [sighing] Jack finally told me what? Why are you leaving again? Why are you here? I had to talk to Jack for a second. Oli, he's seeing a doctor? Don't change the subject. You don't even know Jack. Why are you here? I don't know. I guess, um, I came for you. For you. Because I am out on my ass and you're the only family still talking to me. Barely, but still. No, Viv-- Yes, yes. You need a place to stay. Jack needs someone to cook for. [sighing] Taxi, hey! Oli! Wait. You're the only man Jack ever wanted. There. I said it. Good. Happy? Okay. What? Viv... Viv! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, what? Hello! Kindergarten. Middle school, high school. What about them? He ended up working for you. So? Lots of people work for me, Viv. He slept with your sister. Once upon a time. Look, he's the father of your nephew. Duh. He's been dancing around, arms flailing for, like, decades, he's just never had the balls to talk to you. Not that you deserve any more adoration-- That doesn't make any sense at all. You've got, what, five million friends online, Johnny. I mean, who the hell can compete with that? You know, you could've told me. Mom! Taxi! No. No... I am not a match-making fruit-fly. For once, figure something out for yourself. You don't deserve him, Johnny. Ice cream in the freezer-- don't eat the mint chip. I love you, Johnny, for some reason, I do, and Jack is family, too, now, okay? My family. Treat him like caviar. [♪♪♪] [shower running] Hello? [shrieks] Oh! Ow! You never seen a naked man before? What the hell? Put some clothes on. What is this? What is with the apples, Jack? Viv and Oli just left. They said I could crash here. So, as long as you don't kill me in the middle of the night, I'll take the couch. They're gone, Jack. They moved out. You should talk to her. Get out. What? Get out. Right now. Hey, hey, hey, remember 5th grade, when I had a wedgie, you helped. I can't do stuff for you people anymore! If you can't afford to pay me, why should I work? &quot;You people&quot; as in tall people? Funny! You said I make good coin? You don't even know what you pay your employees, John. I live in a box! What you see, this is it, and it's half my freaking salary. Okay, I'm sorry. I guess I didn't... I didn't mean... For now, I'll do your dishes. Did you look at my proposal? I'm sorry I ate your ice cream. Get out! Jack! Jack, I'll find it tomorrow. I'll read it tomorrow, then we can have a meeting after. We are not having a meeting. Here's a recap-- the family that I've been building a future for just left. Get out, and let me cry over it! Jack, at least let me get my clothes! Out! My underwear, then? Jack! Jack! I didn't know Oli was your kid, Jack! I would've been more subtle about the whole marriage thing. [roars in frustration] Eat your underwear, you piece of shit! I'm sorry! [♪♪♪] [buzzes door lock] Oh, hey, sir. Sorry, we lock up after hours. Were you at the gym? No, not tonight. Egg roll? No, I'm fine. Have you seen a red folder? What... this? Oh, thank God. Oh, whoops, sorry, I thought that was trash. Recycling came by, took the pages out, about an hour ago. No, no, no, no. [chuckling] Gotcha. Wow. Sense of humor, eh? Sorry, sir, if I could-- John, you have this look of guilt every time you come here. You gotta just eat, sleep, work, and play. You know, relax a bit. Like your dad, he's great with that. [chuckling] Aw, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make it a thing. It's Bruce, right? I've been here for, like, five years, man. Yeah, I know, it's a thing I have. Oh, wow, are you on meds? Sorry. No, I mean, I have trouble remembering names. It's Bruce. Bruce Weber. Like the photographer? He's one of the best male gay nude-- Wow. Yeah. Yeah, never mind. Look, was I out of line? You know, with the whole gay-- the guilt-- the guilt thing? No. No, I appreciate it, Bruce. And good eye. Eyes. [chuckles] I think I'm gonna go. Hey... how often do you eat Chinese? It was on special. Ma, we keep telling you, you don't need to buy so much stuff. Ah, cheap, cheap. No worry. Buy more, big discount. Cannot eat so many. Thanks. I come here also because I want to tell you story of your father. Ma, I don't think I can handle it right now. He not bad man. Your Father... actually, he not even a man. Wait, what do you mean? Jack, put the fish in the bottom, not in the freezer. Must eat fresh. What do you mean he's not a-- Fish! Fridge! Now! I'm getting flashes-- I'm coming out from a zoo. You mind finishing your story? Oh, not from zoo. From jar. Uh... 1983, Beijing University, first time test-tube experiment. They ask for volunteer to put sperm from refrigerator into my-- Ooh... whoa. I tell you this now, because I see you marry for wrong reason. You choose your own family. You not have to be same like everyone else. [knock on door] Hey, um... I read your proposal, and aside from some spelling-- Ooh, Mrs. Kang. Hi. Who are you? Your neighbor. From before. Oh, uh, John Jardine. [chuckles] Okay. I go. Ma, you don't need to-- Call me tomorrow, huh? If I not buy dress for wedding, I spend money on vacation. Bye-bye. Bye. That explains you in a nutshell. You brought my towel back. Thanks. Jack, I am here to brainstorm. I'm not in the mood. I've got a great idea-- John, I'm not in the mood. My personal life just swooshed down the toilet. Well, we can talk personal, because I listen. [groaning] Oh, gimme a break-- Here. You know, up until the other day, I didn't even know you were into me. What have you got? Cucumbers? Zucchini? I have cyanide. Some Draino underneath the sink? You want some of that? Mm, hot. My mom just told me I'm artificially inseminated. Oh, you're making me wet. I'm a communist lab experiment. Practically inhuman. It's, uh, why I'm not attracted to you, at all. Yeah, I know, what's to like? Oops. You're wasting my food. Hmm. You saw Grunge Buckets without me. That band from Surrey? You took Davin Magee, that... swizzlestick wench. We were best friends. You don't remember, do you? The concert? Jack, that was, like, ten years ago. You think you can do whatever you want because you're rich, and famous, and beautiful, and perfect, and-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, wake up. Because no one gives a crap about you, but you. If you think all that, then why did you want to partner up with me? 'Cause you're rich and beautiful, and famous, and-- well, you're not perfect, but you've always had this thing for the unknown, a passion for it. It's a small part of you that isn't wrapped up in entitlement. I see glimpses of it sometimes. When you're not scared shitless trying to prove to everyone else what you are. But that's about it. I don't know if I'm fantasizing, but if seeing you for you turns you on somehow, you should really stick around. So you know, there's a lot of Westernized Chinese restaurants. Good. You're staying. It's just 24-hour greasy crap. So, instead of-- gentrifying Chinese food, as we've seen for decades, why not make Western food Asian? I mean, I'm not talking food-truck fusion here. I-I mean, taking local staples Chinese-style... like Dim-Sum steamers and, uh, sliders, with Peking Duck instead of hamburgers. And what you showed me-- Dragon apple quail, huh? You had it all along. It's Asian flair, it's screaming to come out. You live in North America, yeah, but you're Chinese, so why hide? [chuckles] That's awesome. Can you cook anything? Grilled cheese? I can work with that. [♪♪♪] [laughing] That's nice. Okay, okay... [♪♪♪] Fall of Rome. Right here and right now. Plebes! You're destroying everything with your tolerance. You're mixing metaphors with melodrama, honey. You're mixing me caring with me being late for pilates. What? Are you for real? Vivienne! You listen to me, or you get out of this house. I have a say in that. You have a child, Vivienne. What's wrong with you? Either get Jack to marry you now, or you tell Jack to take a hike. Men respond to tasks, women respond to feelings. Mom, what does that mean? I don't know-- Quoting Dr. Cheval. Who the hell is Dr. Cheval? &quot;Heck!&quot; Vivienne. &quot;Heck!&quot; Mom, give me a break. Shut up! Shut up, shut up! All of you. What happened to this family? Can we run away again? Yes. You deal with this. Your opinion would matter more, Monique, if they put voting booths in your spa. Dad... It's not personal. She's still dealing with having you as a teenager. She'll be fine. Can I please just-- Go pee. Dad... I can't believe it's over. Poor Oli. I mean, somewhere in my heart, I knew. Jack was always so fascinated with any details that included Johnny. You know, it's just, you know, when I was pregnant, and Jack was willing-- I don't know, something happened. I just suddenly wanted a real family. Don't make regrets for yourself, Vivienne. Oliver's a great kid. [sniffles and sighs] No more wedding, kiddo. You can't force things the other way around. We're all crazy, aren't we? So help us. Stop complicating. Simplify. Life's tough enough. Although, with John and Jack, we may need something different. They're both going to fight it for all it's worth. Yup. Maybe... drama would work better for them. And also, we should have a little fun in life, don't you think? [groans doubtfully] You deserve a little revenge. I have a secret weapon, and she's crazy. [tuning strings] [telephone rings] Well, hello. Angela, how are you? Excellent, thank you.

You come? Marco, it's John's mother. What? What you want? I need you to stop John. So you want me give John massage now? Marco, listen, if the wedding goes as planned, keep John away from us. Can you do it? Okay, okay, so now you want me find John, stop wedding, No, not the wedding, stop John. And then... massage? Well, whatever, just make sure John doesn't come near the wedding. Okay. I find John. I stop him. [giggles] Call you back. Why are you so mean? You know what a shrink is, Oliver? Five minutes, sit. 100 calories, huh? Start young. A &quot;shrink&quot; is a doctor, a doctor who told me to let your mother run. This feels funny. Now, listen up, and I'm only gonna be saying this once. You hate me. No. No, I happen to like you a lot, but I can't let anyone else know that, do you understand? Your Mother would have had too much pressure if she stayed, and I wanted a grandchild, and you are it. So, you couldn't just tell her? I had my own excrement to deal with. Understand? Your dad's side, your other family, left a lot to be desired. I should say leaves-- leaves a lot to be desired. But what about Uncle John? Can't he have babies, too? Well, that's a different conversation, about the birds and the... Bees? No, no, birds. We'll talk more tomorrow. [chuckling] Mm-mm-mm. Don't test me. [groans groggily] Johnny? Johnny? John? John, this isn't-- [sighs] Marco, what are you doing? Stop following me. Your mommy want you happy. You texted me. I think I owe you one, a promise. I... stole it from your restaurant. I help you with your box, if you help me with my mast. [yawning] Is there a porn star teaching you English? Man, I can carry my own groceries. [♪♪♪] [breathing deeply] [elevator dings] [chanting softly] Om mani padme om... [clears throat] Jardine's is Jardine's, kiddo, nothing Asian about it. It's not about changing the company, sir. I was thinking a subsidiary. Are you marrying Vivienne? Don't think I can, sir. You could. But I won't. You should. A four-bedroom in Steveston. Here's my advice. The man that has come between you and Vivienne, he's a pickle, next to a burger. Whether you eat him or not, he's just a garnish, nothing to do with the main meal. Can we talk about real food? Vivienne loves you. And as I recall, she hates pickles. Please, Vivienne's not-- Welcome to the family. Take the house, forget the recipes. I'll promote you to the office. Office? But I'm a chef. Wait, no. I can't keep this. Mr. Jardine, I'm thinking an Asian restaurant serving Western food, old-school Hong Kong, I know, but it's high-end. &quot;Dim Sum chic.&quot; Casual fine dining. Chinese-style. French cuisine fusion-- coq au vin, rice, noodles, I've got, like, 1,000 recipes in my head. All right, Jack, all right. Cater the wedding, show me what you can do. Wait, what? We'll talk subsidiary later. [beeps intercom] Candice. Yes, Mr. Jardine. Get me a quote on wedding planners, guest list, invitations, for tomorrow, noon. Uhh, tomorrow's not gonna be enough-- Who's the wedding for, sir? Vivienne and this Jack Gaang, and, uh, make sure the team draws up a pre-nup. Right away. Meet Vivienne, 3:00, Jardine's. And stop scrooging, young man. Buy her some flowers. [♪♪♪] Hi. Thanks for the flowers. Can you bring the bottle? Right on. Preenie. Sign there. Why'd you run? It's what I do. You sure you want to do this? Cold feet. You had yours, and I had mine. Yeah, but... What're you getting out of this? A family. A feeling. We'll always have a family. Me, you, and Oli will always be related. [quickly] He's not yours. Oliver's not your son. Excuse me, what? [burps] Totally not related. Where's your, um... where's the wine? What? I'm looking for a waiter. I'm looking for a cleaver. Jack... Don't &quot;Jack&quot; me. I watch soap operas. You got to be kidding. Yeah, you were drunk that night, too, but there was someone else... some loser party-crasher from the 'burbs. I think it was Burnaby. I was, what, 19? 20? Okay, 21. I panicked. We were friends. You happened to be Chinese, too, and I needed you. Um, Oli doesn't know. Probably don't want to weird him out with that stuff right now. What the hell, Viv? I feel sick. Okay, okay. Jack... Calm down. Calm down! I'm totally kidding. What? I was testing you. To see if this was about Oli. But, no, he's, uh, he's definitely yours. Actually, maybe. Uh, not sure. Don't know. I was drunk, too. Um... So, how do you feel? Oh, ah... Jack, hello. [inhales] Ah! [laughs nervously] Welcome to Jardine's. Enjoy. Look, I had to know if it was just about Oli, okay? Doing it for the kid. No more guilt. We got to do this one clean. Jack, it's like we said, right? My parents, they're old-school... I mean, the prenup, the marriage, the contracts, the paperwork. [mix of sobbing and laughing] We're gonna have fun together. The wedding's gonna be awesome. [laughs] Times you want a twist-off. Look, I'm sorry that I lied. About, um.... lying. [smashing glass] I wanted to know. Are you running towards something you want? Hmm? Jack? Or are you just running? Either way, I'm here. Jack... don't do this 'cause you're scared. Oh... I'm not scared. Not of the wedding. It's getting married... to you... that's freaking me out. Can I have some? Bathroom need a queer-eye. What're you doing? You don't like? I take off now. Oh, my God. No. No. Leave it on. [door opens] Hey. He carried my groceries. I shave his parsnips. Peeled. You peeled my parsnip. There's no &quot;S&quot; in parsnip. Jack. I don't care. Do whatever. I'm getting married. Your dad said &quot;yes&quot; to the recipes. He's partnering up with me. I'm not sure you're in on the thing. Who designs this crap? Can you not be passive aggressive? I want &quot;happy ever after,&quot; John. I give happy ending all time. Marco! You want commitment? I mean, we just had sex for the first time. John, you slut. Marco? Get out. I just say truth! Get out. Get out. Okay! Fine. You ever heard of dating? Yes, I have. And nothing is happening here. Where were you this morning? Downtown. You left. You didn't stay for coffee. I would've considered that a date. You don't have beans. They're in the freezer. I am sending movers. Jack! You keep demonizing me because of your own insecurities. I went to the restaurant, to get ingredients for us. 'Cause all you had was Chinese stuff and we needed the basics. Look, for the first time, I'm actually feeling something. I'm building something. You don't get it, do you? I can't get something that you're not saying. I can't share a kitchen with you. I know you work hard. Not my point. Yeah, you got good taste, spent money on your palate, travelling, eating. But you have no clue how it feels to slice a tomato when it's raw, as opposed to boiled or baked. How that translates to how it sits on a plate, or in a bowl, or in a Bloody Mary, even. Okay, so tomatoes have feelings? The way people drink, eat, a communion... how the tomato feels on the inside, when it becomes a part of our bodies. Until you see all that, you... you can't respect, appreciate even, what a kitchen, what my kitchen has to offer. Ingredients aren't just things to stuff your face with, John. We're alive. We have feelings. 20 years... I was obsessed... pretty much in love with you... thought maybe you cared, but you just didn't know how to show it. I care, Jack. I'm here, aren't I? You challenge me. You throw shit at me. You fight back. You're different and cool. And I don't want to be different and cool! I don't want to throw shit back anymore! I want love back! You're going through some life change, trying to find meaning... like, correcting the spelling mistakes in my recipes for cooking? Do you even see what you do? You should find what you're looking for first, John. Then maybe one day, you can text me. You'll be married! To my sister! Dreams take sacrifices. And I'm not gonna give that up on, what, a one-night stand? By the way... you can say parsnips with an &quot;S.&quot; There is a plural. Surprised you didn't know that. Why so serious, John? You peel me? Do you offer anything else, Marco? Ever? You want scissor? No. I don't want scissors. Fine. I shave myself. Is he real with himself... ever? He try to make life better. He have good heart. Well, maybe that's the problem. Hey. Don't move. Why you not take him to Garage Bucket? It's &quot;Grunge Buckets,&quot; and honestly, I didn't even know he was into music back then. He like music because you like music. Friendship like that sometimes. But also, when he was young, I poor, he cannot afford. Shit. Well... Come, I finish. Look. Wow. That... nice. It's not always about you. You know, back in homeland, when I was young, very miserable. Heart not peaceful. So I try to be like other women, have baby. Then I make new home, have son. Now I happy. Today is different. You love who you love, but you live life any way you want. No one force you. But two people must talk. Sometimes, three people must talk, but always, you must create your own life. [banging] Viv! Viv? Viv! No, Viv! Viv, don't do it. Guys, come on. I know you can hear me. Dad. Dad! Mom. Let me in. [alarm blares] Johnny... Dad... Yes? Would you stop fooling around, please? I just want to come home. Monique, honey, can you turn that thing off? [Monique]: Where's the button? It's the one that says &quot;O-F-F.&quot; Look, I don't know what else to do. You left yesterday. Yeah, but all I've got is this expensive taste you gave me. [alarm turns off] [sighs] I don't have any skills, assets, any real friends, even. All I do is criticize everything and... Listen to yourself. What? Gratitude, kiddo! John, that's all we ask. Well, you worked your ass off, I know. I'm grateful, Dad. You never think about the future, kid. Maybe it's 'cause you're gay. [laughs] That's offensive, you know. I'm talking about you. That's all. Whether you end up marrying or having a kid... no matter. You've never thought about paying it forward. It's not healthy, Son, to just feel good all the time. You've got to give to get. The wedding's tomorrow. Jack's at his mother's. Do what you will. It is your life, after all. [♪♪♪] [thunder rolls] [rain starts to fall] [knocking] Jackie, someone here. [Jack]: I've made up my mind, John. I know. You're not invited. We'll have you to dinner at the house sometime. It'd be nice for Oliver to know his Uncle. All right. I can't believe this. If you're here to judge me on my choices, get out. I love Vivienne. She is my best friend. That's who you marry. Just... pretend, for a minute, that we're both straight. Okay? I know that that is a reach, but work with me. And I'm your good buddy, giving you advice on your whole big, straight, dream wedding, night-before type thing. You don't marry your best friend, Jack! That is settling. Don't settle. It won't last. She's also the mother of my son. Yes, and she's been that for the last ten years without marriage. It's... And what, are you the expert on straight marriage now, too? Okay, I get that it can't be all about me. Okay? I have heard you all loud and clear. So, please, even if we never kiss again, even if it's not about me and you, let it be about you. I'm chasing my dream. Bullshit. I have had great sex with you. I don't believe for one minute that this is your dream. I mean, the house in the 'burbs, maybe. The son is a done deal. The restaurant, absolutely. And you're not in that picture. I know! Not me! But someone who loves you... not &quot;friends&quot; style, Jack! Not friend style. Do it all, Jack, but do it with someone who loves you the way you deserve to be loved. You can't stuff your true self in this box to make other people happy, and do it and pretend it's required to achieve your goals. Your mom said it to me earlier... &quot;Now, you live life any way you want.&quot; She loves you, and she doesn't want this for you either. So do it your own way, Jack. You are beautiful, and talented, and perfect. I know I blew it. So... I am so sorry that it took me so long to figure it out. So don't do it for me. Do it for you... the real you. Okay? The real dream. The one you can't tell anybody about. The one I glimpsed the other day. Do it for yourself, Jack. Please. Bye, Johnny. See yourself out. These were supposed to be outside 20 minutes ago. Do you mind bringing them out? Yes, sir. Don't quit your day job. Stop eating, then. You are in the weeds. I'm hungry. It's amazing, Boss. What're you talking about? We have costume for you, hello. You like? Yeah. [John grunts awake] Wedding! No! John, John! No handcuff! Stop! I love you! John! Stop! Where's Uncle John? Why can't you marry him? You're stupid when you talk about him. Hey. You're stupid, too when you don't. You'll learn one day, Oli. You can't be stupid all the time. Lucky! Come on. [Wedding March plays] We are gathered here today... Whoa, what? Jack... We're starting, okay? We're gathered here today to join this... couple in holy matrimony. Johnny! [yelling] [barking] [squeals] [yelling] Jack! Don't do it! No. Oh, no! [crashing, breaking glass] Oof! Oh! Stop the wedding! Keep going. [Marco shrieks] Jack, what else do you need? He's everything you ever wanted... What're you doing? And he's here. He's stopping your wedding. [thwack] Part of the plan. What plan? Mom, it's okay. No plan, no plan! Just... don't worry about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. Johnny, no, please. Mom. I am in love. Let it go. No! No! Please. Don't worry... Jack? Mm... mm. Now, that... was the icing. No house in the 'burbs. That's all I ask. We're moving in now? But we just had sex for the first time. What? He did text me. Grunge Buckets, final run, 2002. Freeze-dried apples, for when you get mad at me. And... stickers for all the crap you go thru at work. Don't get too grateful, though. It's partly selfish. We're starting a partnership, right? Right. And... I might be falling in love with you, but brace yourself, 'cause I'm probably pretty bad at it. Where do I sign up? Right here, right on the... [muffled laugh] Yeah. Dad. Sir, I... You okay with me, uh, working again? I was thinking I could help Jack out. It's called dating, Johnny. No. No, not just that. I... I think Jack can head a restaurant. And I can be there for him, front of house. For us. As long as he's cooking. [laughs] [Monique]: Vivienne, when I had my wedding, we actually... Oh, Mom... You know, Dad wanted this. Besides you, everyone's fine. Right, Oli? You enjoy the show? Mm-hmm? Mom, that's the cake. Mom! Mom, that's disgusting. Um... Everyone? Thank you. To John Apple Jack. [Crowd]: To John Apple Jack.
