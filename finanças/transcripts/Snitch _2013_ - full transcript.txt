That party we just threw, there were over a thousand people there, bro. No way. Oh my God, I can't wait to get up there. You know what we hook you up to. Is move some "candy" I'll put some serious paper in your pocket man. Oh, speaking of this is, I'll bring in about two boats to begin the holiday break. Two boats man? That's like 2.000 pills. OK, another $ 7.000 is what it is. And some of that could be yours. Nah, I'm OK man. Look man. you don't got to do anything. I just gotta ship the box to your house OK? I can't fly with this stuff. I don't know, bro. - Come on, it's for like a day until I get there. And you can even have some. And you said that Amanda are diying to roll I'll talk to you later, alright? / I'll text you the traffic... No. Don't. Hey, why don't you answer the phone? - I was skyping with Craig. Halo? Hey, Maggy. No, Nick said the layoff wouldn't affect our division. Mike I understand, but the bottom line is I need to buy all four rigs. Anything less than that, There's no point. I might as well just keep leasing. Well that's what they do, those hollers They get together once a year,.. ..and they raise a raid before the gas prices . They do, because they know they can get away with it. See the contract? Yeah, its real. But I just don't know when it's gonna start. How much money am I gonna have to borrow? Alright, let's move some equity around. I've been rolling the dice my whole life, might as well do it agin. I gotta go. Solid week boys, thank you. I figure Analize would have you putting on brims and balon. I'm still out getting Izzy's cake. Good luck with that. - I need it. Have a good weekend, Wayne. - See you. You know there's no OT, unless it's authorized. I don't look for OT, sir. This guy broke a pallet. I get my bags out of the wheater It's gonna rain tonight. Good heads up. Whoa sir, I got this. Seriouslly, I don't want you get dirty. It's alright. Let's do it together. I'm John Matthews. - Daniel James. Good to meet you, Daniel. Don't worry about it. How long have you been working here? Do you mean work for you? About 3 weeks now. What do you think about give me that raise already? Fat chance, buddy. You gotta try, right? You gotta give it a whirl. Packages for Jason Collins? - Yeah, that's me. Alright, sign right there. Alright, thanks. Have a Good one. - Thanks man. Department of Justice! This is DEA! Open the door! Right there! Back fence! Down! Get on the ground! This is central. Reporting in. Acknowledge. We have custody. Cake. That looks so good . I love you. Hi, baby. You're having fun on your birthday, Izzy ? Hey, Sylvie. Let me call you back. What? They tell you anything? Just to wait here until we're called. They're treating him like he's some kind of major criminal, John. We'll straight 'em out. Is he in with my last name or yours? You know we changed it to mine. Why are you even asking? Hi, my sons Jason Collins.. - Take a seat and wait to be called. Can you at least tell me where he is? You notice anything different? Like what? With him. Who he's been hanging with. Anything out of ordinary. No, John. I haven't notice anything. This is such bullshit. I mean he's a good kid. Mike's sending a lawyer. Good, you can afford it. Didn't you quit? Mr. and Mrs. Matthews? - Yeah. Thanks for coming. - Where's Jason? They're moving him from this holding cell to court room. He's scheduled for a hearing this evening. It's alright. Leave him in jail for a little bit. Scare the hell out of him. No one's trying to scare your son. This is federal case. The amount of MDMA or ecstasy they found means they've charged Jason for distribution of narcotics. Jason said that a friend asks to have the drugs sent to the house. What friend? - Friend with the name Craig Johnson? That's his best friend. Christ, I have known Craig since he was little. Jason was arested trying to mail the pills,.. ..and he agreed to work with the goverment. What do you mean, "agreed to work with the goverment"? Both Craig and Jason are being charged under federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws. These laws were design to ensare high level drug trafficer .. ..get them to snitch on other trafficer in order to reduce their own sentences However, most of the conviction over half have been first time offender like your son. So, Craig is implicating Jason? - Yes, in order to reduce the sentence.. ..Craig told the DEA, that Jason agreed to have the pills sent to the house,.. ..and also has agreed to help sell them. - What? Now Jason has denied both of these accusation. Do you believe them? Of course I believe him. He would never be involved in anything like this. Are we talking about probation here or could he actually go to jail for this? The mandatory minum laws are very simple. The amount of jail time deppends upon the amount of drugs. There are no mid.. Wait, what is that mean? Jason is facing a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. 10 years? - Are you out of your mind! He just got accepted at collage. John tell him. Oh God.. Jason. United States vs. Jason Collins. how could they deny him bail? He's never even been arrested before. You wanna know the truth? I knew something like this would happen. I figure if I just got him off to collage. But no. Jason has no God damn idea what real responsibility mean. Especially while still being baby all the time. And when your own son doesn't want have anything to do with you anymore? Not true. - Not true? That's not true at all. It's just really hard for kids who go trough divorces. I acted out when my father left. Yeah well, he's not a kid anymore. Not while he's sitting in that cell. The springkler's on? Is everything have to go to shit? Here's the situation. It's very simple You help them make traffic drug arrests.. And they will reduce your sentence from 10 years to 2. 1 suspended. I told you. I don't know anyone else. Just Craig. Bullshit. Your mom told me she smellt marijuana of you before . Where did you get that from, huh? Jason, this is serious. Come on honey, you got to tell us who sold you the pot. I didn't have to buy it. Amanda's dad grows it. He has medicinal lisence. It's legal. I just took some. I just wanted to try it. OK. Are there any of your friend who do drugs and might interested in selling? What, you mean setting someone up ? Like Craig did to me? No Way. You better wake up right now. Because this is really happening. You gonna take that plead and you gonna help them make the arrest. You hear me? I'll take my chances in court. No, you won't. If you do not work with the prosecutor.. ..they can raise the minimum limits to 30 years. Which means you'll be out in time for your 50th birthday. And they are banning over 90% on convictions. Jason, baby. Please listen to him. We don't have another choice. I'm not setting anyone up. - Baby. - I won't do it. Yes you are. Listen to me dammit! You think you know what you're doing? You have no idea until you spend the next 10 years of your life in prison. I'm not gonna let that happen to you, son. You hear me? You're not the one who have to do it. Morning, John. I need to show you something. This is a.. What a beaut ain't they? And they say the other 2 will ready next month. Great. I gotta make a phone call. Terry, this is John Matthews. Good. We definitely gotta get out we'll hit a few. Very soon. Let me ask you something? Do you have a connection to Joanne Keeghan? US attorney down town. Mr. Matthews, you've got a lot of friends in this city. I recieved 4 phone calls in matters of an hour. I'm sure you'd do the same for your kids. I don't have any children. Alright, well. 18 years old. You must've had him when you're quite young. Sophomore in collage. Me and his mom were highschool sweatheart. Well, you have my sympathy. But I believe in mandatory minimum laws. We're fighting the world right now, not just on drugs. But the violence they bring. And we are losing badly, so it's time for all our sake we have to turn this around. Ms. Keeghan I agree. I do. But my son, Jason. He's not a drug dealer. He's a good kid. And he just made really dumb naive mistake. And he's willing to do anything he can to help out the situation. The only drug dealer that he knows is.. Craig Johnson, who you allready have in custody. I'm really sorry to hear that. Please, There's gotta be something I could do. The laws are design to preclude any special circumstances. So it's really quite simple. We'll need your son help us make arrest.. ..before we can help them reduce the sentence. Which he can't do that, or isn't willing to do that.. ..then there's really nothing we can do. I'm sorry. And now I have to be somewhere else. What if I did it for him? - What? What if I help you make arrest? It's not the way it works. - Please. I just wanna help my son. I understand, I really am sorry, but.. ..my hands are tied. There's nothing I can do Thank you for stoping by. Hallo. / Hi. You're here to see? - Jason Collins. Just sign in. Proceed to booth 3. / Thank you. What happened? Nothing. Tell me. It's OK. Talk to me son. it's OK, tell me. You remember when someone keep tipping and nagging your house? That was me. I would sit around the corner and laugh I watch you try to clean it up. Doesn't matter now, Jason. The last time I did. I didn't know you were out of town. I felt like crap watching Elize do it herself. So, I pretended I was stoping by. I help her. - She told me. I hated that you have to live in that big house and new family. Me and mom are just stuck in that old one. I wanted you to live with me. I wanted you in my life. It was my fault, not yours. I was always gone. I was always on those trucks. I was always working, got so caught up. And I'm failing you as a father. That's exactly what I did. I should've never taken that packages, I know what was in it. I should've just told the guy got the wrong address . But I didn't, because me and Amanda wanted to try something. But I swear to you dad, I would never ever.. .. I wasn't planning in helping to sell that stuff. I'm not a drug dealer. You believe me, right? Of course I believe you. And I know I should be punish.. ..for what I did. But not like this. Jason, don't cry. Don't cry, Jason. Not in here. Listne to me, Jason. You gotta show me. You gotta stand up for yourself in here. You have to. I promise you, I'm gonna get you out of here. How? You just gotta trust me. I love you. What you want? - Coke. Crack is whack, man. Who do you think you are, dude? I just go to somebody else. Look man, you really buying it? Money talks. Get off me. Give it back. Cops are rolling! What the hell were you thinking? I'm sorry I threw your name down at the station. Your son is not gonna be better off if you're dead. Clearlly what I did last night didn't work out Clearlly? - Please, what do I gotta do? You are so stubborn. You're not gonna stop are you? No. I'm not Algirht. hypothetically,.. ..I would need airthight arrest of someone in possesion of narcotics,.. ..in the amount of constitute conspiracy to disribute. If we're talking cocain, that would be at least 500 gram or half a kilo. What? - I'm in a construction bussines. And we have ex-cons who are working the yard all the time. Maybe someone knows someone who knows someone. You're their boss. Why would they trust you? Let me worry about that. Believe me, I am not worried. Because the risk is all yours Come on. I'll give you a lift No, thank you. But I'm good I'm the boss. Get in. How's the job treating you. In fact that I got a job. I guess, I'm just trying to say thank you. Me and my family really apreciate the opportunity. It's gotta be hard for a.. ..ex-con. That's why we're here? You need to talk to me about my past? I was completely honest on my aplication. But if there's anything else.. No. That's it.

People get shot and killed. This is my son. - You have more than one child! I'd do the same thing for her. You know that. This is not my rule. It's their rule. Which means that every move that I make, or I don't make.. ..Jason will have to live like 10 years of his live. And what if you don't live? Baby, have you thought about that? You have family here too. And I hope that I have your support when the time comes. You're not old enough to vote though are you? John, my secretary said you need to see me? You said all we need was either Malik and drug in the same place. That's excatlly what we had last night We had a deal! We had it done. Calm down! It's not just about you. - Stop it. Malik's supplier could be our next exchange. Cooper made the call. It's sthe right one we go for the highest target. You just have to be patient. Take the next meeting. Your son will be alright. You had Malik single handedly with tangky and you let him go? He would've given up everybody. - Bullshit.. I had to make a judgement. TidaNo you didn't. It's my call. And I will decide exactly how this comes down. Do you understand? It's that clear? Crystal. Hey, Sylvie. They took what? Manny, lend me your car bro. I came to visit Jason, but they wouldn't let me see him. They said that he's in the infirmary. What happened? - He was assaulted. They said he had over 36 stiches. When they said assaulted... I don't know, they said they were gonna keep him in at least 2 more days. And there's no way that you and can even see him. I'm trying here, right? I talked to the lawyers at 'Project Inocent' and they said that they were gonna use his case.. It's not gonna last that long. I don't see you getting anywhere! Oh, God.. Please don't do this to him. I should've known he was in trouble. I should've been able to protect him. This is nightmare. It's not your fault. What's going on? You followed me here? Who'd you visit? It's my son. Look man. He made a mistake. His friends set 'em up. They said if we cooperate, we help him. You made a deal? You got any idea what they're gonna do to us man? You have any idea? It's Malik man. It's the cartel man. You know what they gonna do to our family? It's my son. - Your son? What about my son man? I've got a son, John. You're a dead man, John. You're dead man. Where's your mom? She's sleeping. Vanessa, what are you doing? Is this what you've been doing, huh? Your work shift, huh? Can't even take care of your own God damn son! Vanessa, he's in the other room. Look it's not what you think OK. Listen to me. It's not what you think. Bullshit! You made me a promise, Daniel! I stay cleaning, you stay away from that life. Remember? - I understand baby. But right now what I need you to do is... ..I need you to pack a bag for you and Anthony. You need to stay with your mama. You don't tell me what to do. Not after lie.. Enough OK? just... Look.. I'm in trouble baby. I am in trouble baby. Please don't do that Vanessa. Sweatheart.. Wait,wait,wait. I can't do it agin. I can't watch you go to prison or.. or end up dead. That's not gonna happen. You hear me? I'm not going anywhere. Why do you do this to us? Why do you keep doing this? I'm scared... I'm sorry.. They just came right in. Where's Isabelle? She's still at school. Get her, take her to your sister. Now! Go! What are you doing here, Malik? I like your old lady. She in a hurry, huh? What do you want? You want that paper, right? What about Daniel? - What about 'em? Come on man, El Topo wait. Only him. Arms up. You have a cellphone? Yeah. It no longer works. Anything else on you electronics. I understand your bussiness is in a complicated spot. Pretty hard to make money now adays. It doesn't have to be. When you work for us, you'll be treated like family. Of course, includes your wife.. your child. I hear Isabelle is a beautiful girl. You and Analisa are really lucky to have her. Thank you. You will make this next trip alone. Once you make the pick up, You will take it to Meksiko. We will unload your construction supply as well before you cross back to the border,.. ..so everything looks legitimate. Palacio will pay you $ 250,000. All goes well, you will recive much more. Show us your loyalty. And your future will be bright my friend. I will call you the day after tomorrow 10 AM. With an address. Be ready to leave. What about Malik? You work for us now. Let's get one thing clear man. You still works for me. Got it. Just handle your bin player. 'Coz I ain't letting nobody getting me away me and my bread. John, are you OK? - You're at Gaby's yet? I'm in like 30 minutes. You can't go there now. Why? - I need you to pull over so we can talk about this. No, tell me now. What is happening. Is my sister in danger? Mommy, where are we? I love you, John. I do. They knew my wife and kids name. Dammit! What did they knew about Jason? - They don't. How the hell do you know that? - Because from the moment we started this operation, we log you separately into NATIS. What is NATIS? Fed data base. Anyone who logs in to your case file runs your name or Jason They notify me. They ran your name yesterday at noon. That's why they know about Analisa and Isabelle. And not Jason. - No, because he's listed under his mother's maiden name. And you don't have the same address. He's safe. Who'd you meet with? Malik called them El Topo. Who is he? He's Juan Carlos Montero. They call him 'The Mole'. El Topo. He's ex-Mexican paramilitary and he runs this region for the Nuevo León cartel. That's who he is. Yeah, and Pintero was seriously crippeling our organisation. What did he say about the run? Just that there was another pick up. And I gotta take it to Mexico. What, in to Mexico? Why? Because that means you're running their money this time. You see John. One of the ways that we fighting the cartel.. ..is to stop them getting their profit. Right now it's virtually impossible for them to wire the money in.. ..so they have to physically transport it. Hundreds of millions of dollars. This could be an incredible opportunity for us. Especially if we got Pintero too. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah sure. John, would you excuse us for a second? I'd apreciated it. Thanks. What? - You know damn well what. El Topo's a game changer, and he's way out of his depth. Are you kidding me? We can still bring in Malik. No. - We squeeze him for a 3rd strike.. There's no way El Topo is gonna be at the exchange tomorrow. I am not missing this opportunity, even if we don't get him. You know the way this works. You follow the drugs, you get players. You follow the money, you get a 'kingpin'. You know that if he crosses that border, he's never coming back. You good with that? John? Sit down. Drink? - No. Coffee? - No. We had a deal. I deliver Malik to you.. ..you reduce my sin sentence to a year. I'm really sorry. But we are way past Malik now. If we pick him up, we're gonna tip off the cartel. And what about go to a judge? - You can if you want to, but.. ..with the mandatory minimum laws. Judges has no say to reduce sentence. Only the federal prosecutor does, and that's me. Look. This is the last stop. You've been very patience. I give you my word. Your son is coming home soon. Imediately. - 'Scuse me? I go trough with this, Jason come home that instant. And I'll make sure that every parents out there.. knows how compasionate you've been to my son. OK. You complete this. And I will have the judge release your son. But, I need the money.. ..and the arrest of the cartel player, nothing less. Hey, John. What time they calling you with the pick up address? 10.30. Tomorrow morning. The reason they pick sunday, is a high traffic day at the border. Less inspections. You don't think this is a good idea, do you? Hey man. Don't matter what I think. You made a deal with the 'Dragon Lady', not me. John, you gotta know there's a reason.. ..they pick you so quick for this run. Cartels don't use wrong people to carry loads. They recruit.. ..guys like you. Favorite target is a.. middle class kid in a school. Make it sound all exciting to carry your backpack full of dope for pockets full of cash. Then they do it. These guys threatening to kill our family.. They use them, they abuse them.. They end up in a pool of acid. That's it, they're gone. Done. Easy come, easy go. Because there's always be another mule to take their place. Brother you gotta know this is one serious backpack you're about to carry. Hello. I'm here to see my son. He should be out from infirmary. I see, under Matthews? Jason Collins. Just sign in. Go to window 4. Thank you. Are you OK? I'm fine. God dammit. I can't keep letting this happen to you. They said anything about moving you? How is everybody? Bagaimana Izzy? She doing alright? I've been wanting to tell you something. I'd admire you so much The stand you're taking. You didn't take the easy way out. Not setting up one of your friends. I couldn't do what you did. So looks like you're the one.. ..teaching me. What real character and integrity is all about. I love you son. I love you too. Who is it? - It's John. What are you doing here man? I park a few blocks away. In case somebody's watching. Daniel, thank you for not ratting me out. Believe me man, I've thought about it. If I don't go trough with this. They not gonna release my son. What you don't understand man.. You play nice with the feds man. But what happen when Malik and everyone finds out that you're aninformant? What happens to me that puts me right with you? They know I'm a ratt. They will hunt us down man. They gonna come after the families John. Daniel, I know I'm the one who put us all in danger. And I gotta live with that. There is no way.. ..I'm gonna let either side.. ..dictate our fates. No way. The address come through? Yeah, I know the area. It's gonna take about an hour and a half to get there. The route is only 52 miles west of your warehouse. It's still gonna take 90 minutes in the semi. No longer. - Leaving now. Both wire is loud and clear. Our guys is 20 miles out. - OK. He's been sitting there 15 minutes. What's he doing? Shit. Alright, let's do a drive by. Shit. Anybody hear anything? Voices? Struggle? Where the hell are you, John? What took you so long? Just lost the DEA. We're on. Hey John. You sure you pull this off, right? Not without your part, No. I need that number. We counted every dollar. You'll be responsible for it. We can't triangulate the cell. maybe it's turned off. Why would he just? What the address in Mexico? - At El Paso.. The main border crossing. I will tell you which lane. Only you are gonna be in that truck to avoid suspicion. We're gonna follow in the cars. Once you've crossed, Nico Juarez they gonna direct you to.. ..the final stop. - Alright. I like them your tactics, homie. Straight boom rush. That's the Cruzz I know. I need the number on El Topo bro. I'm gonna leave,.. ..and I'm gonna call 911 man. Man, me and you both know they're already on their way. Yeah? - You and I know if I cross into Mexico, I'm a dead man. So you think you better off going alone? Despite what you might think of me, John.. ..I am your only protection on this. yeah, maybe so. But as many times you guys change your game on me. I had to put something in the play first. Yeah, like what exactlly? You know my deal with Keeghan was for the money and the boss. Well, I'm gonna make sure that they happen on this side of the border. Would you track the cellphone number that I'm on. I'm in one my other trucks right now, and it's filled with their cash. John, listen to me. I just got a hit on NATIS. Somebody connected you with Jason. I don't know who it is, but I'm working on it. John, can you hear me? Pull over, now! - What's happening there? They know. Get Jason to protective custody. They have people on the inside. - Don't you worry about him. We're on it. We got units coming to 'em now. We already got the prison lockdown. He's in isolation cell. Locate the second number. It's: 517-555-0199. It's El Topo cell. - Get me that number tracked now! Putta! Did you get them? Yeah. We lock his position of his cell.
