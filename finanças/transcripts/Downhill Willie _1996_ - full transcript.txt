You gotta be down a quart with lots of sky between the ears to ski like that, son. You didn't even have snow half the way. Gee, thanks. Don't mentions it. Hit the lights for me, would you, Willie! Yeah, sure. Lights here don't seem to be working, Jake. Neither do yours, son. Well, I got a surprise for you, Jake. What's that? You'd learn how to spell your name? No, like I finished fixing the plane for you last night. You did? Yeah. See, I've been watching you fix things around here for years. I think I finally got the hang of it. We'll see. Watch. What the hell did you do? Oil change. Don't come near me. MAN: And look at him go, a combination of talent, aestheticism, system and sheer bravery. Extreme skiing at its best. Men down mountains at 120, 130 miles an hour. Everything America wants in a sporting event. Bravery, speed, and imminent disaster. They'll be peeling off his skin with that suit. Now, that's good television so what do you think, Mr. Grimble? Well it's, it's-- Chilling. No, more than that. It's chilling. So, where does Jock Pop fit into all of this? The Kamikaze Run. Most dangerous, most extreme ski race in history. Kamikaze Run. The Jock Pop Kamikaze Run. No, no Mel. The Jock Pop Kamikaze Run. That is genius. We'll invite the world's greatest skiers. Imagine, Mr. Grimble, the greatest skier in the world hold ups a bottle of Jock Pop, or he holds it up so we see it's Jock Pop. And he proclaims, Jock Pop makes me the best of the best. He'll be holding and showing. Well, it's great that we'll have the best, Mel. But what about the every man who identifies with our drink? How do we include them? The answer, in one word, is wild card. That may be two words, Mel. Murray, get the dictionary. Mel, continue. It's simple, Mr. Gribble. We'll have regional wild card picks who will compete for a chance to participate in the big event. I like it. Make this happen, Mel. I'm holding you personally responsible. Yes, sir. By the way, what kind of people are these skiers? I can assure you we're talking about the finest, most wholesome, upstanding citizens in the sports world today.

No. Five, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, dollars. Oh, Royal Sky Dude, you who allows a gnarly hairball like myself to carve sweet ones down your most radical peaks, which I might have looked like most excellent honkers. I know we need no trophy hunters while we're catching air. But your Royal Skyness, grant me the power of an avalanche and the strength of the sun, that I might free ride my way to a most bitching run. That rhymes, cool. I am the half pipe, free my soul. Whoa! [BRANCH SNAPPING] Like, thanks, Sky Dude. This is totally outrageous. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN YELLING] Mama, I wasn't ready. Why did you push me? Why did you make me crash? Grow up, you simple.

Mortgage ain't been paid in eight months. Well, I knew it was coming sooner or later. Nothing I can do about it. Business is bad. Well, what do you expect way out here? There's no walk-in trade, no road, no phone, no people. Oh, no. Let me hang that for you, sheriff. - What? - Here, take that. Hey, hey, hey! [GUNSHOT] Whoa! I'm getting out of here while I'm still alive. [AIRPLANE ENGINE] What's this mean, Jake? JAKE: They're going to shut me down. You think that'll be bad for business? You can say that again. OK. You think that'll be bad for business? This means we're out of business. Gee, Jake. You really think I'm good enough to win that ski money? Kid, you're the best natural skier I ever saw at it. And hey, hey. They got regional nominating committees picking the best local skiers for two wild card spots. They got extreme skiing, jumping, flipping, all rolled into one event. I can do that. And listen, this is fun, they got speed skiing. You hit the mountain, 130, 140 miles an hour. You got to be nuts to do that. Well, you got that in your favor, kid. Gee, thanks. I don't know anybody on no regional committees. Sure you do. Congratulations. As the self-appointed head of the Winnepakee Ridge wild card nominating committee, I hereby and officially appoint you our wild card representative. I'm touched, Jake. You sure are, kid.

Excuse me, but the last people must have left these in the hotel room. Some little soaps and towels and things, they'll probably be calling looking for it. It's pretty nice stuff. I'm going to go check out that swimming pool. What's that, Flipper? [DOLPHIN NOISES] Timmy's trapped in the cave? Yes. Look out, Flipper. It's Jaws.

And I got this past, and I'm above the bar. ANNIE MEYERS: I had fun today. WILLIE JONES: Me, too. Thanks for picking out my new clothes for me. You sure I didn't look dumb in the other stuff? No, no. It's just, you know, you can't wear the same thing every day. Does that go for underwear, too? Well, I guess I'll see you later. Annie. What about socks? So, tell me, a big handsome brute like you. Do you ever get to Austria? Is that near Vancouver? Van who? Hans! GUY LEBEAU: No, I'm from Paris. I'm from Sussex actually. I just use the French accent thing so I can shag more birds. Works like a charm. So, the rocks are coming up quick. I know I should traverse on my toe. But I'm still looking for the gnarly extreme thing. And then it happens. I carve two feet from a rock on my second ragdoll. Yes, I'm humbled by the line. Yes, I could have sketched. But I'm Half Pipe. So, you know what I do? I turn to my bro Rad Man. I say Rad Man, take the main gully. I side slip the death buddies, and there goes the Radster, hanging 10, hanging 20. Being huge, catching the ultimate air. I am humble, truly. Danny boy, excuse me for saying this. But you don't know what the hell you're talking about. I mean, ain't you this much of a stoner to watch your bros as gnarly lines as catching air yourself? Whoa. Like, that's profound. Yeah? Don't get Freudian with me, babe. Cool. How's dicking night? Well, Dickie's doing a hell of a lot better now that you're here, darlin'. Why don't we let Samantha take Dickie for a little ride. Yeah. Oh, yeah! [MEL MUMBLING] Go ahead, ask her. No, I've been striking out all week. Mel, You are a stud. Women cannot resist the corporate type. I'm telling you. Yeah, you're right. I forgot. I'm an executive. - There you go. That means I have confidence. Women like people with confidence, but you gotta remember you have confidence to use it. Have confidence, I get receipts. Excuse me, would you like to dance? Oh my god! Sure. I lead. I was kidding. I'm not. Oh. [SLAPPING AND SHOUTING] Yeehaw! Woo! Don't spoil me, baby. Come on! [HORSE SOUND] So how'd things go with Willie? No problem. Look at him. SPIDER BOLTON: Are you sure? Which guy you're talking about? The one who's walking funny. That's not Willie. That's Murphy. Murphy? No, that's Willie. Dick Willie. Who's Dick Willie? He is? What are you talking, Dick Willie? Yesterday, you pointed at him and said get that Dick Willie. But I didn't call him Dick, because that sounds too tough. And Richard's too farmer, so last night I went over to him at the bar, and I asked him how's Dickie? And he answered doing fine now that you're here. You screwed up. No, I screwed him. Jeez, I was pointing at that guy. [CRASHING SOUND] You screwed the wrong guy. You got to fix it. Hey. Still works, a little. If Willie wins, tonight you get him. You got it? Uh huh. Not Dickie, not Jonesy, not Prickie. Him, Willie. You understand? Uh huh. Good. I have an interview to do. It's a living. [GRUNTING] I've got to pee real bad. It's just nerves, kid. I don't know if I can hold it. Here's a little something I learned on the tour. What's this for? You fill it up, kid. Spider, no one denies you're the undisputed favorite, the greatest in the sport. How do you do it? Well, Dan, it's all about integrity. I try to use my head. I live right, eat right, try to respect my fellow competitors, and just try to be the role model I used to look up to when I was a kid. Now, what? Tie it off and get rid of it. SPIDER BOLTON: And my inspiration, Dan, well, that comes from up there. [SPLASHING SOUND] Spider Bolton, what a guy. How'd it go, kid? Good. You don't look so good, Mr. Murphy. I'll be fine. You know, I'm feeling kind of dry myself. Where'd you get that water? From the water cooler. From that thing? Water comes out of that? Huh. Hold this for me will you, Mr. Murphy? Thanks. Technology. What will they think of next? ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the semi final round of the Jock Pop Kamikaze Run. Today, we'll see newcomer phenom Willie Jones take on the comeback story of Jack Murphy. [YAWN] All right. Good luck, kid. You too, Mr. Murphy. OFFICIAL: Racers ready? Five four, three, two, one, go. ANNOUNCER: They're off. JACK MURPHY: Yeah! ANNOUNCER: Murphy literally attacking the top of the course. JACK MURPHY: Woo! ANNOUNCER: Oh, a nightmare on that jump. And they're into the S turns. JACK MURPHY: Yeah. ANNOUNCER: This is anybody's race. They're matching each other move for move. Willie is looking good and picking up speed on his way down the track. And oh, he has got some nice air here. Whoa! ANNOUNCER: Approaching the final jump of the course. JACK MURPHY: Yeehaw! ANNOUNCER: Oh, he is down. Jack Murphy is down. Yeah. [CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: In the gate, the favorite to take it all, Spider Bolton. OFFICIAL: Racers ready. Five, four. ANNOUNCER: We're down to the last two skiers. Annie Meyers appears ready. They're off. They're on the extreme part of the course. They're close, Meyers looking very good. But Spider looking up for second. Go, Annie! [ANNIE YELLING] SPIDER BOLTON: Is that all you've got? ANNOUNCER: And into the S turns. This is anybody's race. [ANNIE SHOUTING] Little bit of pushing and shoving. [SKIERS JOSTLING] [PUNCHING SOUND] [ANNIE SHRIEKING] Ouch. Annie Meyers is down. Hey, that was dirty! SPIDER BOLTON: Yeah, yeah! ANNOUNCER: Oh, he has got some nice air here. Here we go, down the final straightaway. Yeah! ANNOUNCER: A really solid run for Spider Bolton. [CHEERING] You cheated. She fell. I hit a groove. She couldn't get out of the way. No, Spider. You did that on purpose. Yeah, Willie? And if I did, what are you going to do about it? I'm going to kick your ass. Only this time for real. Ow. Piss ant. Willie, what a kidder. So, OK. What are you going to do now, Burns? Thinking of taking up synchronized swimming. There's a lot of money in that, you know? What about you? Foreign service, diplomatic corps. Howdy, darling. Hi. Hi. Buy you a drink? I-- I breast not have one. I had enough boobs to fill a jug or two. You know just what to say to turn a girl on, don't you? Hi, Willie. He's a little bit busy now, honey. Would you like me to order you some chocolate milk? You feel like joining me for some dinner? No, Willie. I expect you to beat Spider tomorrow. [SLAPPING SOUND] So, I'm ordering you up to your room, and into bed. OK? Sounds good to me. Me, too. Can I have a good night kiss too? Good night, Willie. Good night. Goodbye. Night. Good night. [KNOCKING] Be right there. You left something at the bar. WILLIE JONES: What? Me. You know, I probably could have beaten that turd Bolton, but that Samantha chick really wore me out. You don't think it was possible? Well, same thing happened before my race, I mean, that woman kept me up all night. And I do mean up. So, wait a minute. Both of you were hit on by that silicone monster before your races? Yeah. Yeah. That means that spider was the only male who made it to the semis who wasn't. Well, poor Spider. So, let me see if I understand this. You want me to take my pajamas off? That is so silly. I just put them on. But it's getting worse in here. I can turn up the air. What for? Well, I better get to sleep now. Good. Cause it's time for mama to tuck you in. You're nice, you know that? I'll be right back with a big surprise. You'd be a good boy and get mama some ice. Yes, mama. [KNOCKING] HANS SAXER: Mama. Mama. Hey Billy, have you seen my mama? Mom? Yeah, yeah. Mama's in there. Oh. She must have switched rooms. Mama? Mama? HANS SAXER: What is this, mama? Oh, mama. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Mama, mama! Oh, oh, mama. You know, that sounds like something Spider would do. Yeah, me and the Crazy Canuck here are just the kind of butt heads to fall for a scheme like that. Willie's racing Spider tomorrow, and I just saw her follow him out. I guess he's in for the night of his life, then. [CHUCKLING] Tough break out there today, Annie. Of course, you know it was an accident. What do you say we leave these hooligans and go get wet in the pool, huh? Why wait for the pool? [PUNCHING SOUND] And that was no accident. [WOMAN SCREAMING IN PLEASURE] I know this is none of my business, but I'm coming in. [WOMAN SCREAMING] MRS. SAXER: You lazy! HANS SAXER: No, mama. No, mama. No, mama. Stop it, mama. Please. [HANS AND MOTHER SHOUTING] MRS. SAXER: I want to kill her. HANS SAXER: Please, mama. Hi. You want company? Sure. Hans is in my room getting beat up by a couple of mothers. I can't go in there. Willie. I-- I learned something from you tonight. What's that? That all men aren't shallow, hormonal, sexually driven, penis-brained jerks. Can I tell you a secret? Sure what. You were wrong. Well, I better clear Hans out of my room and get some sleep. Good idea. Willie. Did I mention that I like the shallow, hormonal, sexually driven, penis-brain type? Me, too! [MURPHY MUMBLING] JACK MURPHY: Shut up, or we're going to wake up the whole damn town. [HUSHING SOUNDS] All right, get in here. The longest shot wins. Oh, come on. Don't-- this is a respectful town. You don't do this. All right. So we're all in for $10, right? Yeah. I'll go first. I'm going to bust. [SOUNDS OF URINATING] That's decent, man. But experience rules. Viva France, leave my pants. Well, watch out below. Here I go. Yeah. [FARTING NOISE] [MEN SCREAMING] [BEAR LAUGHING] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the championship round of the world's most exciting ski event, the Jock Hop Kamikaze Run. Thousands of fans are lining the run having been here since the crack of dawn with only one question on their mind. Who is the world's best all-around skier? Spider Bolton or Willie Jones? Hey, doofus. Don't try to buddy up with me, Spider. Let me tell you something, dickhead. You're a poor excuse for a skier and an even poorer excuse for a human being. What are you trying to say, Spider? You're a loser. You're the lowest rung on the food chain. You're plankton, you're earwax. Look, Spider. You've got something to say, say it? You're a goddamn piece of brain dump. You throw like a girl and you squat to pee. Nobody's perfect. You squat to pee? OFFICIAL: Racers ready. Five, four, three, two, one. Go. ANNOUNCER: And they're out of the gate in the final race of the Jock Pop Kamikaze Run. Stride for stride in the extreme section. The final section of the run is marked by three obstacles never seen before in professional racing. This Cyclone Snow Cone, the Ring of Fire, and the Slush Cup. At these speeds, with these obstacles, any kind of fall would be disastrous. [SPIDER LAUGHING] - Hey, Spider! SPIDER BOLTON: Come on, come on! ANNOUNCER: Uh oh. Looks like there's something going on between these two racers. WILLIE JONES: Hey! Play fair. JAKE: Come on, come on. Get around that guy! WILLIE JONES: Oh, Spider. Let me go. ANNOUNCER: They still look good as they struggle through their first jump. It's Willie in the lead through the S turns, but Spider isn't letting up for a second. WILLIE JONES: Spider! ANNOUNCER: They're down but back up. And Spider is back on course. See you, loser! [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] ANNOUNCER: Spider doesn't even seem to be phased by his fall. Willie Jones has disappeared from sight, folks. So it looks like Spider Bolton may be our champion. Wait a second. SPIDER BOLTON: Shit! ANNOUNCER: I don't know how he did it, but it looks like Willie Jones is back on course, and actually ahead of Spider Bolton. Unbelievable! Willie and Spider both take jumps for the compulsory aerial. And they're into the mogul section. The sun has softened things up quite a bit. But that's not slowing down these racers. A helicopters for Willie at the bottom, and a daffy for Spider. They're heading down toward the Cyclone Snow Cone. It's going to be close, but it looks like Willie is off the side of the Snow Cone and airborne. It actually looked like he jumped the first part of the Cone, and he's landed back in the track, still going strong. SPIDER BOLTON: Come on! ANNOUNCER: What an amazing sight, as the racers make a death-defying leap through the Ring Of Fire. They're off the final jump. Oh, into the Slush Cup neck and neck. This is close. [SKIERS GRUNTING] [MEN GROANING] They are down. Both Spider and Willie have fallen just feet from the finish. SPIDER BOLTON: Come here! Get back! ANNOUNCER: This is anybody's race! Come on. All right! ANNOUNCER: They're running neck and neck to the finish line. It's Willie. It's Spider! It's-- it's-- Willie Jones! [CHEERING] Yes, yes! You did it, Willie! You did it. ANNOUNCER: The winner of this year's Jock Pop Kamikaze Run. Willie Jones, who's won the $500,000 Jock Pop Kamikaze Run! [CROWD CHANTING "WILLIE"] Shit! [CROWD CHANTING "WILLIE"] Willie! Yeah! Mama. Ah! Road trip. You're kidding? I baked cookies. Chocolate chip. With macadamia nuts. Oh, I'm in hog heaven. Patch out, Road Miester. Yeehaw! [ENGINE REVVING] Stop this! Mama, I won't be back. What? You won't be back? Hans. I'll let you wear your shirt. Hans! I'll cook for you. Hans? Wait a minute, I'm a manager. Do you need representation? Oh. You again! [PUNCHING SOUND] [MEN YELLING] [PUNCHING SOUNDS] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: (SINGING) Two cool skiers sitting side by side. Wrapping a tub, going to open wide. They know what it takes if they're going to win. They'll be cutting the ice, and digging in. Speed bumping and cutting the fool. Cool running and starting to move. Let's go Willie, go Willie, straight to the top. Kamikaze Run. Let's go Willie, go willie, just can't stop. Kamikaze Run. [MUSIC PLAYING] Go, Willie!
