This movie is based on real events. What time is it? Hanne… Hanne, could you please use a plate? A plate. Oh, American? You could say that. Can I help you? Yes. What time is it? Quarter past ten. Nine hours difference. I never seem to learn that. Did you arrive just now? I was supposed to meet a dentist in California, but then they sent me here. I didn’t even have time to change. The guy I'm supposed to meet isn’t arriving until 12. Sure about the time? Yes, its a is quarter past ten. Are you going to meet an old friend? No, he doesn’t even know who I am. But you might know him. He works near here. Arvid Blixen. Do you know him? No. This is my first day here. You must be wondering why I’m meeting him. Wasn’t there $80 in this? Yes… Where did they go then? It was my money. I gave it to the church. You did what? Arvid, I was supposed to buy pants for that money. You have 40 other pairs. You shouldn’t spend our $80! I'm so tired of you, Arvid. Do you think you’re Gandhi or something? Hanne, can’t we eat our breakfast in peace and quiet? Arvid, I actually think you’re the world's most boring man. Does it say "moron" in my forehead? Preben, we can’t lend $2500 without any collateral. You make your living borrowing money. It’s some startup capital, damn! I'm sorry, but I can’t do anything. You’re a big fucking office pig! If I see you again, I'll kick your teeth out! Get it?! Arvid Blixen. He used to work at the bank. Then you could go over there and tell him you’re here? Simple. But it doesn’t work like that. Funny, isn’t it? It’s only 12 days since I heard the name Arvid Blixen for the first time. Yeah, exactly 12 days. Look what I bought. What do you think about it? Can I try it out? What did it cost? Everyone that doesn’t want to get shot get down on the floor! Stop crying! Stop crying, I told you. Stop crying, I told you. All right. Are you gay? Yes… Listen now, Henning. Gay-Henning. Is that what they call you? No. If you don’t stop crying, I'll send you to gay heaven, and you wouldn’t like that, would you? An armed robbery was stopped today when the 31 year old bank accountant Arvid Blixen struck the armed robber in the head with his squash racket. Arvid Blixen, how do you feel right now? It feels a bit… You’re a hero, some would say. I'll cut for a few seconds. Don’t look straight into the camera. Don’t be nervous. Just look at me. Do you always carry your racket with you? No, I was supposed to play squash tonight, but I'll probably stay at home instead now. And this is Henning's racket. You’re still a bit shocked, right? Yes. What made you do such a thing? I don't know. I think I just… … felt it was the right thing to do. You’ve gotten 14 days of vacation now. What are you planning on doing? I'll spend it with my girlfriend and perhaps even go to Paris. Hanne? Go to Hell, Arvid "Goto hell… Arvid." Who the hell are you?! Why did you hit Franz? Franz? You could have let him get the money. You have ruined our lives, just so you could play a hero! You could have let him get the money. Franz isn’t a criminal. We could have used the money. But you can’t rob a bank. Why not? We would love to get a baby. Do you know what artificial insemination costs? No. Hey! You forgot your wallet. Thanks. Thank you very much. Look! It’s that pig from the bank! Shit! Now you'll get you ass kicked! Stop, god damn! Go fuck yourself! Fascist Pig! Go to hell! You got to stop calling me. Get out, and meet some people! Do you understand what I've been going through? I've hit a bank robber, been attacked by his girlfriend and been beaten by a rock band! Arvid, come up with a good reason instead of just lying to me! Hanne, I need you. Arvid, stop fucking calling me. I'll try again on Friday then. Friday, yes. Good. Talk to you later. Bye. There's more cream over here… What's this? It's a fondue. Fondue? Yes. Coq poulard. That’s good, Peter. Who went to the market? Vuk… Vuk went to the market? Why? He just got his driver’s license. Is there something wrong? Are they bad, or…? Puk! What's this? Radishes. They’re supposed to be red. Don’t you have radishes in India? You shouldn’t come here with bad fruit! Get it? I'm sorry. "I'm sorry". Puk, you're a nigger. It’s been some time… What are you doing here? Did dad die? Dad died nine years ago. Then he missed when we won the European Championships. What do you want? I want to talk to you. OK. What happened to your eye? I got beaten up. Hi. One porter, please. Certainly. We're doing some talking. I'll be all right. Arvid and Harald are going for a ride. They haven’t seen each other in a few years. Did you buy this restaurant? No, I won it. Have you been in the city for long? I live here. I've been since dad died. He always hoped that you would show up. No, he didn’t. You must have had one hell of a life. And you’re still an asshole? Yes. Damn, what a shitty life you’ve had. Can you help me out here? What the fuck is it in this? Nothing. Some heavy stuff? Yes. What do you really want? What do you mean? Why did you suddenly show up? Why? I'm going to rob a bank. What? He wants to rob a bank. It sounds strange, but that’s the truth. I'm going to rob an armored transport. I know exactly when it arrives, but I’m not sure how to go about it. You’re the only criminal I know. We're going to rob an armored transport together, Harald. We’re going to rob an armored transport? The two of us? What’s her name? Astrid. We're going to give Astrid and Franz money so they can go away and get a chit Nice, right? Is she going to get all the money? No. Don’t ask such a stupid question. Explain that part about "happiness" again. It was wrong to strike down the robber. One shouldn’t stand in the way of two people's happiness. Good, isn’t it? You’re going to rob an armored transport to help some other people. For once we're going to do something that’s right. It's not completely right, now is it? If Arvid says it is, then it is. One could say… Why are you interfering all the time? You’re going to get a crane and a truck. Do you have the bag? Where is the armored transport? They didn’t have any, but… No problem. This pear is the transport. OK? The transport comes driving here. Then the crappy car comes here and drives into the transport, so that it flips over. You two jump out of the truck. Arvid and me appear and trow out the drivers. You drive up by its side and lift the transport up on the truck. …and then you drive away. There. OK? This is how it’s supposed to happen? Yes, exactly. Right? Yes. Who drives the car? Unbelievable. She has two children, and he's flirting with a gay make-up artist. Henning, you mean? Yes. Bredal… The woman at the bank. Fuck…! It takes some getting used to the thought of him being gay. I didn’t know Harald had a brother. Have you done anything like this before? Harald has. We work as chefs. Sometimes I consider calling the union. You aren’t going to shoot someone? Who knows? Vuk, it's a Volvo, made of reinforced steel. There’s an airbag. We'll secure you safely. I won't do it. Are you ready? Vuk doesn’t want to… Listen now. It’s a Volvo. You can’t even be in this country. I won't do it. What's happening? Vuk doesn’t think the car is good enough. It's a Volvo. He crashed a car once before. Yes, at the city hall square. I won't do it. I won't do it. What? What's he saying? He won’t do it. Listen up now. Either you drive the car, or you’ll be guarding goats. OK? Strap him in real good, so we can get on our way. Buckle up. It’s a bit hard to get it into reverse. Do you want me to try? Let me do it. Hard, isn’t it? I softened up the gears. You softened up the gears? Yes. We're done. After some problems Peter has managed to soften up the gears a bit. Good, Peter. It’s true. Puk, are you ready? Hey, Puk, are you ready? Ready! You aren’t eating right now, are you? He says he's all done. It’s the same hydraulic. The same if you haven’t used the blow dryer in a long time. If the truck is kept in the garage for a long time, then the oil will get thick. Lunch is over. Let’s go. Here they come! What's happening? They're on their way. Puk, let's go… You don’t expect that many people to be gay… People in the government, high politicians… What the hell is that? Drive, dammit! Get this piece of crap going, for fuck’s sake! Full speed! Start! Speed it up! We're losing him! Go… go! Now he's doing it! Get the mask on, damn it! Get the crane down! Get Vuk! Slow it down! All the way to the windscreen! Come on! Get down! Get down! Get down! What the fuck are you doing?! You're crazy! Sit down and shut up! Sit down! You’re completely crazy! Don’t you wanna get rid of these outfits? Yes. How much is it? $65 000. Does it hurt? Martin… the overall. I think he broke both… They'll grow back together again. Peter, check what Erling can do. He has got to go to a hospital. Get him up. What’s the matter with you? You have crippled two people. What should I have done then? Played poker with them? You're insane. You’re supposed to do things properly. No matter if it’s right or wrong. You would have done it for the money. And because you’re fucking crazy. I could see that you enjoyed it. Do you really think so? I’m doing all of this because… you’re my brother. Here… Take all of this shit. $67154. Why should I get that? Because I've made a mistake. Astrid! Are we not friends? Was she pleased? Yes. What did the others say when I just took the money? Peter and Martin got $2000 each. Of your own money? And Vuk? He doesn’t get anything. He'll just buy gold chains and crap. I can’t understand how it’s gotten a scratch here. We got to get Franz out of jail. Her husband. He's still in jail. He's got to get out. And? I thought you might help me with it. What’s your plan? I don't know yet. Find out how to do it, and get back to me. I'll help you. But you better not call me a psycho again. Come on… No money. You have no money. Hello. Hi, Arvid. A swine is really wild, right? Vuk wants some money. Did you know that pigs can get an orgasm that lasts for 30 minutes? What? Their orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. That can’t be true. They don’t get it every time though. No, no… Damn. Vuk wants some money. He gets his pay cheque. He doesn’t think it’s fair. Vuk doesn’t need any money. He wants to send some to his mother… Grandmother. What’s the matter with you? What is it you want, you ungrateful fuck? Don’t you like it? I was just telling Martin… Don't you like being here? He shouldn’t be complaining. You're a racist. So what? There's nothing wrong with that. You two can give him some of your money, right? Yes, we could. Good! Then that’s settled. Give him $600 each. Shut the fuck up…! They had to give money to Vuk. Do you have a minute? I'll have another one of these. Where do you come from? That’s another long story. Do you play cards? Sometimes. What do you play? Poker, Black Jack… Want to play some poker? I was just telling… what’s your name? Erik. I'm Richard. Jørgen. Jørgen wants to play cards. I’m in. What kind of poker do you want to play? What do you think? Hit or draw? Draw is fine. Three, four, five, six… and a half. His mother can’t be too happy with his arms either. He says you made him. Made Vuk? Vuk only does what he wants to. Let me know the next time he "wants" to do something. Do I look like a social worker? Harald, next time he goes, watch him. As long as you’re his boss, he's your responsibility. Remember that. Aren’t you going home to watch a video or something? See you, Harald. Vuk is rich. Arvid is going to find a way to get Franz out of jail. Martin and Peter is helping, but it’s not that easy. We’re getting police uniforms, and then we enter saying he's being transferred. It won't hold. How is it supposed to be done? I don’t know. I’m a chef. I think people get themselves out. I need 25 banana splits. Will you get the prawns from the fridge? I can do that. Thanks. Did you get the bananas? No. You told me you were getting the car back. What the fuck did you do for four hours? What's this? Are you crazy? That’s Plastic explosives. It’s Harald's. Why does he have stuff like that lying around? He probably exchanged it for caviar. Don’t touch it, Arvid. Nothing's going on. It's C-4. Plastic explosives. You detonate it electrically. Do you know much about this stuff? I've been in the military. You could blow a hole in a prison wall. I could blow Amager up. If Harald isn't using it. You had kitchen duty. You were placed in the food department. It gives you a broad education. Sure you can do it? Of course. Otherwise we can do a test explosion first. Didn't we say 11:00? He was going to send the money with the mail. Shouldn’t we use a bit less? It has to be realistic. I have a lot more. If anyone hears something… There's no one out here. OK, Martin. Lower it down. If you’re blowing a hole in something, you need something heavy that can press the explosives to the wall, else you only get a very small hole. They're good, right? Arvid… You can do it. When you press this one, it’ll detonate after 60 seconds. Get over here. Come on. OK. Should I do it now? Sure. Press. OK, let's go. Take this. 60 seconds. Now you just wait and see! It’s Vuk. Vuk, get out of there! What the fuck does he have with him? Vuk, get away from there! Maybe next time we should use some less, Peter. Sorry. I didn’t know he would show up! Find Puk, and let’s get out of here. Go, go. He's gone deaf. He should be rinsed with water for two more hours. I have to leave now. Easy. First we have to fix two cars. Thanks for the help. It’s the same thing with clay. Normally you can’t use old clay. We’re here. Something could have gone wrong. It didn’t. You don’t use explosives that are more than three months old. Watch Vuk… What the fuck is he doing? He's deaf. Well, he still shouldn't stand in the way. As opposed to last time when the water container was close to the wall… This is the explosives, and you’re the wall. Last time we only got a small one, but this time it's half a meter away. Straight into the wall. Totally different kind of explosion. Look what I've got in the car. 100 liters of water, to keep the ballast in place. So that the explosion goes straight into the wall, in a totally different way then last time. Two lumps of C-4… Same delay as last time. How much is it this time? A quarter of the last delay. Where did you get those sandwiches? Vuk’s uncle's got a place. Why didn’t we get any? We thought you’d already eaten. Take a bite. There's nothing left. Take a bit from the other side. I don't want that crap! Shouldn’t the car be set back? Yes. What does it say? 30 seconds. Think about someone else than yourself. Fuck…! Vuk! Where is he? Move it. He’s under here. He's dead! Hand on top of your heads! We killed him! No, he’s OK. We killed him! Shut up! Hands on top of your heads, or we’ll shoot! Fuck you! A little late night snack. Thanks. Harald? No. No, thank you. Its cold chicken with cheddar. Can you pass me the smelling salt? He's deaf, god damn. This? Yes. We're not getting any younger. He's dead. No, he isn't. He's got the nose bone in his brain. That doesn't kill you. You shouldn’t fucking kill Erling! Stop, damn it! He's dead too! Arvid… Give me that. What are you doing? You could have shot me. Arvid? You’re the one at the bank! You shut up. All of you shut up, OK? There won’t be any more deaths in here. Take Vuk and Erling out of here. Where should we take them? To the circus! Where do you think you put the dead? No idea. I’m a chef. Take them to Sondermarken. Yes. Bury them there. Right now. Peter and Martin leaves for Sondermarken. How do you say that? What have you got, Erik? Three queens. Three kings. You're very lucky. I've never seen anything like it. I know a guy… No, that’s another story. I'd like to play with him. You might get to one day. Where was I? Sondermarken. Arvid had a long talk with Franz, but he was still very confused. First you hit me in the head with a racket, and then you get me put in jail. Then you try to blow me up. Are you insane? I’m sorry I hit you. I know I did something wrong. It's even worse to blow people up. I know. I want to make it up to you. Who the fuck asked you for that? Your wife. My wife? She told me why you did it. What the hell are you talking about? You can’t have kids. I don’t have a wife, and I don’t want any kids. I hate kids! Isn’t she your wife? No. I’m a bank robber. Not a very good basis for a relationship. You’re married to Astrid. Astrid Henriksen. Your wife. Did you talk to her? What did she say? Everything. That you couldn’t have children and that she wanted help. You didn’t give her any money? Well, you could say we did. Isn’t Astrid your wife? No. I saw a picture with the two of you… Who's she then? My sister. Astrid is my sister. Last time I saw her she took me for $600. How much did you give here? $65 000. $65 000? Shut up. Did everything go all right? Sure. Good. Could you maybe take another turn? You’ll freeze to death in here. Vuk is dead. Yes. And Erling… We killed two people. Three. I just shot Franz. Are you going to kill me too? No. You’re my brother. I don’t understand anything anymore. No, you never did. What’s there to understand? There's no right or wrong. You decide for yourself. In China you can eat an entire dog without anyone caring. There you just have to find out what you can’t do, and then don’t do it. You don’t believe that, do you? Yes. I should have just gone to Paris with Hanne. Doesn’t it feel bad that Astrid has got $65 000 that's ours? Yes. Isn’t it fucking cold in here? Come on. Astrid! Shouldn’t we leave? She might be in the bathroom. Who are you looking for? Astrid. That might be hard. She has left for vacation. I don’t understand anything. She bought a mink coat. I don’t get it. It’s hot in South Africa. Isn’t it? I have a meeting at ten o'clock. Can’t you give me a ride home? It's him… Who? Did he hit you in a head with a bottle? What are you going to do with him? You have to do something, Arvid. Else you’ll become like your father. You can’t just let people piss on you like that! No. You work at a bank, right? And you use your head? The worst he can do is to hit you in the head. What does he do for a living? He's a guitar player. The worst thing you can do is to shoot him in the hand. He shouldn’t fucking hit you in the head with a bottle. Other people could get a bottle in the head too. It's your duty to do it. Do you understand? What are you going to do? Shoot him in the hand. What the fuck?! Did you hit my brother in the head with a bottle? What do you want to do now? Now he doesn’t… What do you want to do now? I'm going to hit him in the head with this. You better stay calm now while my brother will hit your friend with this ash tray. You fucking psycho! What the fuck are you doing?! Shut up. Next time I'll crush you! Shut up! You’re going to die, both of you! You shut up! I'm gonna beat you so fucking bad! Come on, Arvid! Holy shit. Music. I’m betting on the guy from Bagsvasrd. Have you seen Vuk? Didn’t he get home last night? He said something about a girl. A girl? He had met a good looking girl. A redhead. Want some pasta? No, thank you. I don’t think he's met a girl. We didn’t think so either, but… This is damn good. I think you better talk to Harald. Where is Harald then? He's in a meeting. Tell Vuk to call home as soon as you see him. Harald knows I take care of my family and my eyes. The eyes… is what you take care of the most. Remember that. Maybe we should call Harald. You do know you’ve just killed an entire rock band? I've always wanted to do that. There's plenty of them around. Yeah, exactly. You can’t be to good to show some aggression sometimes. No. Thanks a lot, Harald. For what? For helping me. My pleasure. See you. Sleep well. The same. I'm just going to get the TV. But that’s mine. No, Arvid. I just didn’t get it with me last time. I'm the one who bought it. Why is it yours? Hanne… What is it? Don’t you want to come back? Arvid… Do you remember when we had a cat? Why do you think it left? Because it was bored, Arvid. I've changed. Oh, did you get a wart or something? Give it up now. I’m just here to get the TV. Hanne… I haven’t seen him since… Wednesday. I know nothing. We're chefs. We can’t check him all the time. Harald… I want to say something: If something has happened to Vuk, we'll be very sad, and we're a couple of people. I'll call if he checks in. What will happen if they find him? Then they'll invite us to a concert! What if they… You buried him deep, right? Good, then they won’t find him. Hey… What's happened? I've killed Hanne. We're not going back there again. No, we’re not, Harald. No, you’re chefs. Make some food, and I'll take care of Hanne. Hanne… Who the fuck is Hanne? Why? She went to get the TV. OK. Well… Where is she? At home. In the living room. And in the kitchen. In the living room and the kitchen? Yes. Perhaps I should just leave her there and then go away… for a long, long time. That sounds good, Arvid. Yes. But I need some money. I know just what to do. Good. Will you help me out? I can’t do it anymore. I can’t fucking do it! Don't tell me. They're crazy! Tell them! Yeah, I will. What have you got? Three nines. No…! No one is that lucky. He’s cheating. What are you saying? You're cheating! You can’t prove that Jørgen is cheating, can you? He's a man with luck. One more turn. What time is it? Soon twelve. Did they leave the country then? They wanted to, but first they have to get some money. The only one that can sound the alarm is Gunna and Henning. During their lunch they always go to Cafe Paradis to eat with Finn. So then there's no one at the alarm table. Who's Finn? He owns Cafe Paradis. Anyone got a smoke? What time is it? Half past eleven. Don’t you have a smoke? We've got 30 minutes. Stop asking about the smokes! Go and buy some at Finn's. Get some peanuts. No. It makes your mouth dry. I want some peanuts! The you probably want water too? Go and get the damn peanuts. Do you have cigarettes? Prince. Good. And a bag of peanuts. Where are you going? I don't know. India? Or China? Yes… My dad always wanted to go to India. John Lennon went there. He was shot. Dad? Why? No, dad wasn’t shot. He was fixing a bike… the tire. But he couldn’t find the hole. I took over, and he went to do the taxes for Mrs. Jespersen. All of a sudden he just died. It was something in the brain. Mrs. Jespersen got a new tax form from City Hall. Some way to die. Here you go. Look, what a gay ass! Is it them? Yes. Is he gay? No, I don’t think so. I don't think he's gay. Who cares? Are you ready? Do you think we’re idiots? Take it easy. What are you saying? Where is Finn? He's sick. Is there a back door? Yes, there is! Harald! Harald… Stay down there! I thought you had buried Vuk properly. We only had a small spade. And it was dark. It was Arvid that killed Vuk. Wasn’t it? We're chefs, damn it. Now I don’t have a brother anymore. Can’t you do anything right? Come on… Let’s go. Arvid. Henning… Aren’t you on vacation? Arvid, what's going on? I don't know. I think we're dead. Are we dead? It might sound strange, but you’re dead. Dead? That can’t be right. Normally someone from the dark side would pick one of you up but they’re not here. They might have forgotten about it. Or you might be lucky. Why? If no one from the other side shows up, then you get to come up with me. Isn’t that nice? Yes, sort of, but does that mean we're all getting to heaven? Exactly. Of course. Silly me…! You little devil. I've never seen you before. My third pick up. Who do you want? You! Me? You’re never cheating me in a card game again. I've never cheated. I'm just lucky! Your turn. I take Arvid. Me? Yes. Why? You’re on my list. This can’t be right, and you’re drunk… I want to talk to one of your superiors. Aren't you gay? I've never done anything wrong. I’m just taking Arvid. Sure you didn’t do anything wrong? Yes. Gunna Quist must be on that list. You didn’t screw around or something? What?! You didn’t screw around with another man? That thing with Lars? On Christmas lunch. I was drunk. Was that so bad? We'll have to ask someone about that when we get down there. Those then? That seems to be another department. Probably the same guys that came for Vuk. Some of them are strange. We call them "the men with the funny pants". They're always late. Let’s get going, or we'll miss the bus. You've always been a good boy. I killed Vuk. I told you, it's not our department. Wasn't it wrong to kill Hanne? She tried to steal your TV. You always thought you did the right thing, didn’t you? That's what counts. If you believe you are doing the right thing, then you are. Really? Yes. But… Me, up there? Really? Yes. The rock band then? I killed an entire rock band. They where bad. OK, Arvid. I’m a good friend of of your father, and I promised him I'd bring you. Come on. Watch the steps. Yes, but… Damn! What was the name of the girl that went down with Erik? Gunna Quist. She was on my list. Damn! I was in a rush when I wrote it. Does this look like "Gunna Quist"? It might… I thought it said go now quick. What kind of name is that? Poor girl. I was going to the dentist in California, but then I had to go here. Excuse me, but what’s your name? Come on… Do you have any ID? Come on. Your father is waiting. Watch the door! What kind of music is that…? That's the way it should sound…!
