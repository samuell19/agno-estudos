Hello, my little apple tree, or rather, just my apple tree, because now you're a big free. You were as tall as me the day I planted you. I often used to walk on the riverbank with my father. I planted you on 25 April 1986. It' was 25 April 1986. I felt like I was floating. Not only on the river, but in my life. It was the first day of vacation and the sun had returned. Winter had been long, as it always is here, you know. You're right, Valery. Everyone has a name, you even named your cat. But you can't give names to trees. Why not? Because they don't belong to us. For me, love was everything. Piotr and I had gone to the banks of the Pripyat. I saw folk gathered on the shore, so close. I can still see them quite clearly. I've never told you about that world, Patrick. But should I recall it or let it go? I don't know. Take me away somewhere. Where to? I've heard Odessa is lovely. Odessa? Sure, we could go there. Where are they going? Where? You know, Valery, every year they fly thousands of miles and always return to the same spot. Always. They never get it wrong? No, never. Terminus, Lenin Power Plant. WE ARE THE BUILDERS OF OUR HAPPINESS! Stop! Stop, I said! On 7 May, the city of Pripyat invites all citizens to the opening of its fun fair. A poetry competition organized by the members of the Komsomol in the presence of the 2nd secretary of the party. - Another one? - Yes. That's enough to drink! Dimitri, look at you. You're all dirty. I'm just fine like this. I hope you'll wear a clean shirt tomorrow. You always wear the same shirt. It brings me luck. Give me that. It's the last one. Dimitri, tell him. Listen to me, you! He doesn't let me smoke. Anya, I feel fine. Come on, move along! What's the matter with you? Are you dumb? Do you hear? What an ass! Do as you're told! Stop messing around! I'll clout you, you'll see! Why are you barking like that? Come on, let's go. What the hell is going on? Shit... Where are you going? - I'm a forest ranger. - Heading where? I always pass this way. Bring your papers, the road's closed. What's going on? Nothing. Move it! Go on home. Some cherries, please. Watch out! Bless you, my dears! Praise to the Motherland, which provides us bread, work and electricity. I'm going flat-out! You're all here already? Mama! Greetings! A kiss! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! I love you guys! I love you so much. Music! At the end of the street lies the deep blue sea The chestnut tree is in blossom Konstantin picks up his guitar And sings a sweet song I can speak for all Odessa Because the city is so big But in the old quarters They adore Konstantin the sailor I'd like to thank all our friends who are here today. And... I'd also like to remember my father. I'm sure... that he'd be happy for us. We lived in the present. Not only because we were young. But also because we were children. Who are you? Papa! Children who believe the world has rules, and you just have to follow them to be happy. They're sending us 12 reactors. RBMKs? Papa, come and look at my tree. Put your jacket on. What output will they be? 1,000 megawatts. Sergei showed me the plans. Papa, my tree is dead. We'll plant another. When does work start? In one month. Moscow has it all planned. Well that's a surprise. A solitary artist Lived alone with his paintings He fell in love with an actress Who had a passion for flowers So he sold his house And all his paintings With all the money He bought an ocean of flowers Millions of scarlet roses You can see them from your window Millions... of scarlet roses His love for you will make your life an ocean of roses What's up? I have to talk to you, let's slip out. - Is everything OK? - Yes. Come on. What's the matter? There's a forest fire, I have to go. What? I can't believe it! Can't they leave you in peace today? I don't have any choice. Of course you have a choice. Don't go! Listen, I'd risk losing my job. You're going? Everything will be fine. - You're going? - It'll be fine. Don't go. Not today. - I'll be back soon. - Not today. I love you. - Where are you going? - I have to go. Where are you going? What's up? He's left, on this of all days. On our wedding day, your Pa left to play cards all evening. But after... Sit down. Let's have a little vodka. Come on. To your happiness. Millions of scarlet roses From your window... Oh, heavens! Quick. It's an F, there. Concentrate. There, that's good. Eat. At my sister's in Gomel, they queue 3 hours at the store. Here. I'm not surprised. We're privileged here in Pripyat. What are you...? Yes? I don't get it. What's going on? Why? What? When? But everything was fine in town this morning. What? Who let them do that? They have to broadcast a warning and take emergency measures. What do you mean, confidential? That's impossible. Are you crazy? What? Lena, close the windows. Put rags under the doors. Give Valery some iodine. What's going on? - An accident at the plant. - What? Last night 2 idiots experimented with increasing the power output. They're going to call me with orders. Don't worry, maybe it's not that serious. We'll see. You have to leave, you can't stay here. What about you? All engineers must stay put and await orders. But you have to warn people, Alexei. Lena, I'm bound by secrecy. I have to stay here. You understand? No, I don't! Papa, why aren't you coming with us? I'll join you later. Why don't you come with us, Alexei? Papa, don't forget to feed Liouba. I promise, until you come back home. Off you go. Papa! Where are you going, Valery? Stop, keep out of the rain. It's dangerous! My kids are marching in the parade with the school. Is Valery taking part in the May Day parade? The parade? I don't know. - Hello, gentlemen. - Hello. - Are your kids going? - Of course. Eat! Look at the fire over there. It's beautiful. It's really beautiful. Let's drink to this beautiful night. Alright. "And I will say to you that wind is fresh "And the sky burns with stars." Maybe it's war. Against who? The Americans. What's going on? Don't touch me. I strongly advise you to wash your logs. Wash the logs? They're completely crazy! There were soldiers everywhere at the plant yesterday. I stayed in 1941, I'm not leaving now. He's right! - What's the matter? - We're not moving. No, mama, he hasn't come home yet. I tried calling, there's no answer Maybe it burnt all night. Then he must have gone to sleep. That must be it. He wanted to come home but was too tired. He could at least have called. Where would he sleep? There's nothing there. I'd better go, he might call. What time is it? I don't want to pray, mama. Why the hell doesn't he call? Maybe he went drinking with his buddies again. I'm going to wait a bit longer. No, no prayers. There's no point! Hello, would you like meat or fat? I'd like that piece. - This one? - Yes. - That meat is bad. - What? Don't eat it. Don't eat it? Throw it away. This guy's insane! I'm out of here. - How much? - 30. - How many do you want? - I'll take them all. That's fine. Go on home! Keep out of the rain. Don't stay out in the rain! Get under cover! On May 7, the city of Pripyat invites all citizens to the opening of the fairground. A poetry competition will be organized by the members of the Komsomol in the presence of the 2nd Party Secretary. Wait in the corridor. - Excuse me, is anyone there? - Close the door! Sorry. Close the door! Do you know what's going on? No. Visits are banned. But I have to see my husband. - His name? - Piotr Zhukovski. Sorry, it's impossible. Why not? I want to see him. I'm sorry. He's about to be evacuated to Moscow. I beg of you... Your husband received a high dose of radioactivity. What? He went to put out a forest fire. Your husband is radioactive. Do you know what that means? No. Miss! I have to see him. We got married yesterday, you see. Your husband received 1,600 roentgens. He's not a man, he's a reactor. If you visit him, you'll die too. Do you understand? You'd better go home now. COMMUNISM IS SOVIET POWER PLUS THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE NATION! Is this where you take the bus to Moscow? They said there are no buses today. When you leave your homes don't forget to close windows and turn off utilities and appliances. Get up, let's go! The bus won't wait forever. You hear me, grandpa? The bus is waiting. We inform you following an accident at the Chernobyl plant in the city of Pripyat... The Soviet government and military authorities are taking all necessary measures. All residents must leave their homes. It is forbidden to take any belongings with you. All animals must he left in Pripyat. Don't kill Zhushka, she's nice. Imagine, we thought we were leaving for 2 or 3 days. We were told not to take any belongings. I don't know why, I took one of Piotr shirts anyway. As if I was going to see him again. As if he was going to get on the bus at any moment. I was sure he would. It was unusually warm. No one mentioned radiation. No one was afraid. I think some people were even singing. I heard a woman tell her son we were going to picnic in the forest. You with the dog. No animals allowed! You can't take that dog. Why can't we take our dog? Come on, get on the bus. Why did they take his dog? Hurry along, onto the bus. Oh my dear, don't worry, it'll be fine. Suddenly I saw tears flowing down my mother's cheeks. She didn't want to cry, but the fears just came. The worst things happen without sound. That's the way it is. From then on, I was afraid of being apart from her. Even for one day. And then, we left. MOVING FORWARD TIRELESSLY! TEN YEARS LATER... Hello, I'm Anya, your guide. I'm a former resident of Pripyat. We're about to enter the forbidden Zone. No one is allowed in without a pass. Please get out your passports. Since the blast, there's a 20-mile exclusion Zone round the plant. Our first stop is Pripyat, evacuated just after the disaster, on 29 April 1986. Who's that? Your husband? No, he works here repairing the sarcophagus. People still work here? There are holes in it. But don't worry. There are workers checking there are no leaks. Really beautiful! Absolutely. Pripyat once had 50,000 residents, mainly workers in the nuclear plant. It lies 2 miles from the plant, and 6 miles from Chernobyl city. Just after the disaster, there was climactic instability and the rain fixed the radioactivity across the area. Pripyat was a model Soviet city, the best in Ukraine. There were concert halls, cinemas, theaters. Today, there isn't even water or electricity. You'll be given protective clothing. Don't forget to give it back. There are some rules in the Zone: don't touch any objects or walls; don't approach animals, even pets; they are still radioactive. Are there many kids living in the Zone? None. They're not allowed here. "The 3rd Angel will trumpet "And a great star will fall from heaven burning like a torch "it will spread through the rivers and the waters "This star's name is wormwood "The waters will turn to wormwood "And many men will die drinking from these black waters He's not dead. Why did we come? Be quiet. Is he alive? This is my husband. It's our first time back in Pripyat. I wanted to come alone. What are you saying? TO THE ETERNAL MEMORY OF THE HEROES OF CHERNOBYL What are you waiting for? Open it. We offer this meal to give peace to the dead in the cemetery and so the souls of the living are also in peace for the year. Well... now do you believe me? You should mourn your father. I want to see my tree. We have to go now. Goodbye. Come on. Come along. Let's go, the bus is waiting. Valery! Valery! Come back, you're not allowed! MOTHERLAND, DO NOT ABANDON US IN OUR MISFORTUNE We used to picnic here on weekends. Peasants dyed wool, children came to play in the Pripyat River. On holidays, the Party would organize fetes. What does "Chernobyl" mean? Wormwood, the herb of oblivion. These flowers have no scent. No, there's no odor in the Zone. May I borrow your dosimeter? Sure. How does it work? Listen. Can you hear it? The sound of radiation? You mean the dosimeter's sound? No. Turn it off and listen... There's nothing. Yes, that's it... there's nothing. Isn't she a bit weird? Now we're off to the Chernobyl canteen for a lunch break. Listen to me, my love, don't go outside after lunch. The doctor's coming. You understand, my sweet? Anya, where are you going? Listen. I've got a job working on the sarcophagus. It pays well. We could use the money to make a home together. It's about time. I've found a nice place... I thought it was over between us. Happy birthday... Hello. Come on. I'm afraid it's dangerous. Don't be afraid. There's no problem. Would you like a beer? Here, that's for you. Beer from Chernobyl. A unique taste! It was a good time, the Cold War. For us, in any case. We felt stronger than the atom. You speak very good French. I make some mistakes. The grammar is very difficult. Have you been to France? No. I've never been further than Kiev. But I'm going away soon. My fiance is French. Valery Olgenko Attention please! Valery Olgenko! For safety reasons, you must go to the checkpoint Come on. Come on, please. No child ever rode on the big wheel in Pripyat. It should have been inaugurated on 1 May 1986 as part of the annual Labor Day parade. Pripyat had been evacuated, but that year they celebrated Labor Day in every big city, from Kiev to Moscow. Were you here when it happened? I was married over there, in front of the statue of Lenin. How long ago? It must have been three years ago... Three years? No, it must have been longer. Do you still live in the Zone? Yes, I live here two weeks per month, the rest in Slavutich, 40 miles away. Don't go near, it's radioactive here. You have 5 minutes to take photos. Time's limited in the Zone. Now we must be checked. It's the end of the visit. We're going to pass through Chernobyl city. You can buy souvenirs there. I'll leave you there and the driver will take you back. You know, Patrick, people sometimes ask me what I'm doing here. If I'm not afraid. I've forgotten the fear. I'd often stay awake all night, standing around, thinking... and in the morning, I finally slept. In my dreams, it was all like before. Like before the accident Piotr is there again. He smiles. We talk. We laugh. He kisses me. We walk around Pripyat. Then suddenly, I can't see him. He disappears. I look for him everywhere. Patrick, it's Anya. I can't sleep. I wanted to tell you that I'm thinking of you, and that I miss you. Que je sache... Que Tu sashes... Ou'll sache... Ou'elle sache... Que nous sachions... Que vous sachiez... For a long time, I've been running away. 70 years went by like that And then, I wanted to go back there. something was pulling me. You couldn't understand. I had a strange feeling of liberty. Disgusting! And now: it's time I left, I wanted to go back there right a way. - Sing for me. - OK. I put your song on. Anya! Anya! High above ancient volcanoes Your wings slide... A beer, please. Journey, journey Eternally Over the capitals Fateful ideas Look at the ocean How's it going? Further than night and day Journey Through the incredible space of love Journey, journey Through the sacred water of an Indian river Come here. - What's up with you? - Leave me alone. Every fortnight, it's the same old story. I've told you 1000 times; you'd better forget me. Why are you always running away? You're a puff of wind. A solitary artist... You know very well you'll be back, Anya. You're suffocating me. Anya! Tell me, don't you love me any more? Don't you have any pride left? What do you mean, pride? I can't afford to be proud. I love you, Anya. I just want to see you from time to time. You can lead another life elsewhere. I don't care about that. I don't care. I want to get out of here. I don't want to spend my life rotting in the Zone. And you, that's all you're offering me. How often have you tried to leave? How many times, huh? Patrick will help me. Patrick? How many guys have tried to save you? The problem is you can't stay with anyone. Anya! You can talk! Look at you! You never tried to leave. Have you seen the mess your life is? I like it here. This is where I grew up. Like you. Can your Patrick understand that? Stop. Just let me go home. You're always leaving me. But you always come back. No one will wait for you the way I do. Why are you trembling? Can I ask you something? Of course you can. What would you do if I left? If you left, I'd wait for you. What if I never came back? Then you'd know there's someone waiting for you here. You should quit smoking. It causes cancer. Tickets, please. Sir, your ticket please. Get a move on. Come on. What's this? It's for Pripyat! Are you kidding me? Get out of there! But I showed you my ticket! Go on, get out of here! Trains don't go to Pripyat any more. Go on, get lost. Get off at the next stop. Papa... PAPA, WE ARE IN SLAVUTICH! Is the next train for Yagotin? No, for Pripyat. Are you sure? No, this is the line for Yagotin. Trains haven't run to Pripyat for a long time. Since 1986. So there's no point waiting. What a weirdo! Your attention! Valery Olgenko! For safety reasons, you must go to the checkpoint It is strictly forbidden to remain in the zone. Don't drive so fast! Who are they? I don't know. Why have they got guns? Filthy foreigners! I spit on you! Careful, I haven't fixed the fence yet. Look at this place. I'm going to fix it. Well, this is it. There's a lot of work to do. Maybe, but it's better than your tiny flats in Slavutich. Why's that? Why? We'll have a garden. We'll live well. Where do you want the bedroom? It's so quiet here. I like the quiet. I miss the sound of the train. You thought of everything. I tried to. Come here. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Really? - Really. Hello. Come in. Round the back. This house is taken. The people have left this land and God has taken it back. I can't play when you're watching. You play so well. Where are you going? Do you remember Igor? Yes. Little guy with broad shoulders. I know who you mean. There's a service for him. Do you want to go? I didn't know he'd died. Well, he did. MY God! Nine days ago, in the city hospital. His wife will get a big compensation, he worked on the sarcophagus for 5 years. Why are you so jumpy? You want a coffee? I don't have time. - Are you off already? - Yes, I have a group waiting. The day of the evacuation, 50,000 residents had to leave, without taking any belongings. For several days, the weather was destabilised and the rain fixed the radioactivity everywhere here. Soon, days in the zone started to seem the same. Today, it feels like one long day repeating itself Always the same. The daily visits are a drag. The same old questions. They're all expecting animals with 2 heads, three-legged monsters. You know there's nothing to see at Chernobyl. Just ruins. People often ask me why I stayed. This is my home. See you in a fortnight. I know all these streets by heart. I played here when I was a kid. I ran to be at school on time. Slavutich has a center for radiation studies financed by the international community. One hundred years from now, Slavutich will be a megalopolis; today's regional capital will become a museum city. Since our independence, the aid we receive has been put to good use. It is used here in the service of Ukraine, of Europe, and the entire world. I want to organize excursions here, and to develop large-scale tourism... Pripyat - Slavutich. Slavutich - Pripyat. It's been like that for years. My world closed in between those 2 towns, between those 2 lives. Fate brought us together here It was heaven?s wish The white angel of Slavutich Heralds the arrival of fine days The white angel of Slavutich... In Pripyat, I live amongst ghosts. In Slavutich, I forget Pripyat. For a moment, only a moment. Is that you, Anya? Yes, mama. Weren't you due home yesterday? I was worried. God be praised. How are you? I'm fine. Anya, Ukraine is in the Olympics for the first time, in Atlanta. They've been talking about it all morning. Eat something. No, thanks. Hello Anya, it's Patrick. Are you there? Are you there or not? OK, you're not there. I tried calling. I thought you were due home today. The last 2 weeks have been long. I really missed you. I'd really like to see you. That's all. I'll wait at the cafe. Come soon, I have to tell you something. Big kiss. See you soon The first time we met, you made me laugh. Without meaning to. I hadn't laughed for a long time. A very long time. Hello! How are you? I didn't come to watch you read the paper. You didn't call me much when you were in the Zone. Don't! You know I love you. Anya, I go back to Paris in a month. I still don't know if you're coming with me. I'd like a clear answer now. - Why don't you extend your mission? - I can't. And I'm sick of it here. Really? Yes! You want me to leave all this? I want to have a baby with you. Your baby. A little girl. A little girl? Yes. Blonde? With long hair? Yes. You know it's not possible. Please don't talk about children. - What are you doing? - Nothing. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. We're heading to the zone's villages where the "samosioly" live permanently. The word means colonists in Russian Some returned after the evacuation, others never left. - Hello. - Hello, and welcome. Come in, I'm pleased to see you. The apples from Chernobyl are excellent. Try them. Don't worry, it won't kill you. No, thank you. We don't need to cultivate anything here. In summer, the flowers bloom, the bees buzz around, the birds sing. What did he say? He said he eats them daily and there's no danger. I'm doing a UNESCO study about living on irradiated land. Aren't you afraid living here? He's an anthropologist. He asks if you're not afraid living here. You have to carry on living. We were told we'd all be dead in 5 years I'm still here. Can you see any radiation? Can you feel it? I can't. He says doctors told them they'd all die after 5 years. But he says he feels fine, he doesn't see the radioactivity, or feel it. Why is there a Zone, then? I don't know. You think barbed wire keeps radiation in? Maybe... Who's that? They're refugees from Tajikistan. I couldn't do anything, they just moved in. You've no right to live here! Do you understand? Get out. Chernobyl belongs to no one. Aren't you afraid for your kids? On this irradiated land? I'm afraid of people, not radiation. Get out! The Zone is our home. You understand? Go away! I told you to go. Or I'll blow your brains out! Go on! Go away! Get out! What happened? Nothing. You OK? Yes. Valery! Valery! Don't touch him. Can't you see, he's glowing. "Chernobylitsi!" You're completely crazy! Help! Yes, there's room. I'll make a reservation. The visit lasts a day. It's 300 dollars per person, including meals. Who are the visitors? A journalist and a photographer from Liberation. Which hotel are you in? Fine, we'll pick you up at the hotel. Don't forget your passport. No, it's not dangerous. Even the president of the EU has been on our tour. Don't worry. We supply protective clothing. Chernobyl Tours. Oh, it's you. I don't know. I'm back in 10 days. Which house? That's the third time in 3 months; always problems. What? You've already fixed the roof. Dimitri, I can't talk now. Yes, everything's fine. I'll call you back. No, I can't. I'll call you back. What if we went away and got married? What, just like that? - Here? In Slavutich? - And what about Odessa? Odessa? Yes. I wasn't expecting that. Mama? Mama? Were you asleep? Yes, but I heard you. Nothing would stop me hearing my daughter. Want me to change your blanket? Or your pillowcase? No, not now. Mama, do you want me to pray with you? Shall I pray for you? Mama? Yes, Anya? How old are you? 75. As old as that? And how old am I? 37. Already? I had you late in life. Forgive me, my girl. Anya, stop it. What? Stop turning it all around in your head. Get married, have some children. I'm already married. Pripyat once had a population of 50,000. A city built for workers at the Lenin plant. There were 2 schools, a theater, a cinema, several parks. It was a model city, the most beautiful in Ukraine. These men are the liquidators. They put out the fire at the plant. Then they built the sarcophagus. 4,000 of them perished to save our homeland. They were told: "All hands on liquidation." And no one hesitated. Anya, you're beautiful. And you drink too much, Andrei. I'm going away. Where to? First, I'm marrying in Odessa, then I'm flying to Paris. Paris, Paris... Lucky you! Journey, journey Further than night and day You know that song, no? Journey, journey Further than night and day Journey Through the incredible space of love Your name? Yuri. Andrievski. Why are you taking people's names? We need some fixed points. What use is that? Family name? Andrievich. It's good if it's written down. Valery! You'll be late for school again. Valery! You'll be late again. I'm not going to school. Where's that from? Our flat. We have to go back there. He'll go back there. What are you talking about? He doesn't know where we live. Valery! Papa is dead. I don't believe you. I've waited so long to see Odessa. I know. You made me want to see the sea, to eat ice creams, to stretch out on the warm sand. - Wait for me! - Try and catch me. To go far away from here for the first time. Wait! - Not wearing your swimsuit? - Come on. I've dreamt so often of Paris. - Come on. - I'm coming. Of the cafes, of the Seine. That is perhaps where I'd he truly happy. I'll be there. Where I could love again. Come on. Let's get on. - Come with me. - I'll watch you. I'll wait for you here. - You know, in Paris... - What? - Are you listening? - Yes... The flat is coming on. You'll like the neighbourhood. What about my mother? The banks of the Seine, it's not the Pripyat. I can't leave her alone. She's afraid of the rain. I don't' understand. You wanted to leave so badly. Patrick, no one lives twice. The past is a foreign land that clings to me. I can't do without it. It's like an impossible journey. Pripyat is waiting for me. I can still see its shores. Its people are all there, talking to me. Just as I am talking to you. And if I left, who would tell our story? It's Anya. I'm at the station, Patrick. I'm taking the train. Everything's fine. No, I'm not coming. I can't go away with you. Patrick, I love you. I'm not coming back to you. Where are they going? The storks return here each year. How do they find their way? I don't know. They speak a language that man has forgotten. Where are they going? Where? You know, Valery, every year they fly thousands of miles, and they always return to the same place. Always. My little apple tree, or rather, just my apple tree, because now you're a big tree. You were as tall as me the day I planted you. I often used to walk on the riverbank with my father. Your name? I planted you on 25 April 1986. Family name? Valery! That day, I saw a bride. She seemed to be floating in her dress, her face was so sweet, like you might see in a dream. I wanted to speak to her, but she disappeared. A few days later, I said goodbye to my tree, and also to my city. On that day, the pupils in my school said farewell to Pripyat. On September 1, I went to a new school in Slavutich. Everything was new and nice. There was no need to be afraid of staying outdoors, no need to use the dosimeter to find safe places to play. One year later, after my operation at the cardiac institute, lying in bed I thought about our quiet little street, and you, my little apple tree. During my recent health check I met some pupils from my old school. We recalled our childhood days. Misha said: "We'll die and become objects of science." Valeria thought: "We will die and we will be forgotten." "We'll just die," wept Julia. Today, all my friends from Pripyat are elsewhere. Misha is in Liepel, Valeria in Grodno. My other friends live in the Malinovka area of Minsk. The city where I was born no longer exists. But now, my tree, I know you have a name. In memory of Nikita Emshanov (1983 - 2011)
