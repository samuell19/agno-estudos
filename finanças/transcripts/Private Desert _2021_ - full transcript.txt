I thought about you today as I ran. I can’t quite explain it, but I always think about you when I’m running. It’s a nice feeling, you know? Running and thinking about you. But then, I felt breathless. I stopped to catch my breath. And only then I noticed the silence. I looked everywhere around me. I saw no one, nothing. Not a living soul, the sound of a car, or a dog barking. Remember when we talked about being alone in the world? Well... That must be similar to what I felt then. Do you know what I realized in that feeling? I wasn’t only longing for my breath. I was longing for you. I WONDER IF YOU'VE GONE TO BED YET? I THINK I'M IN LOVE. WET KISSES Dad! How about we go to bed? Hold on to me. One, two, three and... Are you good? Finished? Fuck, dad! That's some bad aim, old man. - Let's go! Put that pistol away. - Maria! - Maria? - Maria! You miss her shaking that limp dick, right dad? Naughty dog. Let's go. Easy, dad. Let's go. Easy. Hold on! That's it. All good? Good night, sergeant! Hey, I want my nude! No, dad. This one, dad. That's it! Give me that arm. Place your paw here. Your arm. Go. Ready! Looking good, right? Let's go? Over here, dad! Dad! Here. Wait here, dad, alright? - What's up, Pencai? - Hi, Moreira. How are you, man? Why not take the old man inside to see the fellas? He'd feel miserable being recognized and not remembering anyone. That's harsh, man! Your father was such an active guy. And yourself? How’s things? Have they set a date for the trial? Have they given you a new partner yet? No. The brass left me on hold too. Now I spend my days at the precinct, doing fuck all. At least they didn’t freeze your paycheck. It's tough, man! I need some work. Fix me up in your business. Can't do it, Moreira. No one wants to hire me after that shitstorm. Do me a solid, man! - What about that arm? - I'll manage. - You won't go crazy on me again? - No. - If you fuck me over... - I won't, man. Relax. Do you have formal clothing? I'll lend you a piece, you can buy some later. They'll pay you after the night shift, ok? - Deal. Nine p.m. - Thanks! Don't freak out on me, again. Hey... Send my regards to the old man. You have to call me before showing up, Daniel. I wanted to surprise the old man. I promised him he’d see a babe today. Déb. I need you to stay with him today. - What about Maria? - I had to let her go. I don't have any money! - You fuck up and I have to fix it. - He's your father too! Did you watch the news today? Do you think they could arrest you? Don’t forget his medication and his diapers. Call me if you need anything. You take care, sergeant! - Daniel... - Don't forget the diapers! Listen up. The job's very simple. Just stay alert, and make sure everyone pays before leaving, and avoid any confusion, alright? Are you carrying a piece? Hand it over. Got it? Let's get to work! Fuck, Dani! I haven't slept an ounce. He paced around the house all night. He’s probably just confused with the new house. What's up, dad? Dani. Come here. - What? - Why don't we take him to a nursing home? - They'd know how to treat his illness. - We've talked about this before, Déb. Come on, dad! I need your help again today. Sleep over at my place. Give me a kiss. Suit yourself. Let's go, dad! I haven't slept either. Wait up. I'll be right back. Hello? Speaking. Yes, sir. In one hour? Yes, sir. With all this backlash, the governor is demanding that I do something. You and Pencai will have to undergo psychiatric monitoring, starting Thursday. The Military Police PR will follow up. Sir, Pencai had nothing to do with what happened. He was there and didn’t stop you, officer. Sir, with all due respect, it was an incident. An incident? Have you even watched the footage? Sir, you know that was the first time that happened in one of my trainings. How could you let that cellphone pass around? Everyone's breathing down my neck. The honor of the officers' school is in jeopardy because of you, Moreira. That's an order! You and Pencai will undergo psychiatric assessment. Think about it, son. This will be good for you when the trial comes. - How's the rookie? - Same way as you left him. Dismissed. I'm sorry. Are you really, officer? You're quiet today. Is everything alright? I really need to talk to you. Hear your voice. What are you doing, dad? Come on, give me that gun. Come on, dad. Alright. Alright. Who gave you that? You can't smoke. Truth is, I went along with it all, right old man? You're just fucking with me with that silence of yours, right? Let's change your clothes. Come on. How’s college going? I'm not sure I want to spend my life inside a doctor's office. I should do something I love, and not what father wanted for me. What do you think? Whatever you choose will always frustrate you. Are you talking about me or yourself? - What a mess! - What do you expect? Two men living alone! I see! Cleaning is a woman's job? - That's not what I meant. - But that’s what you said. Dumbass! Loser! Guess who I ran into a few days ago? Ana. - So what? - Don't you want to know anything about her? - Nothing? - No. - Not a thing? - Where are you going with this talk? - Are you seeing someone? - What is this? An interview? You want to be a journalist now? Just trying to bond with my older brother. Right... You want money, is that it? - Cut the bullshit! - Then what's with the sweet talk? I know you. - I’m seeing someone. - Again? It’s serious this time. So it wasn't serious before? Was it a joke? Fuck. You never take me seriously. I can never have a proper conversation with you. My bad. Go ahead. Tell me about this boyfriend. I'm listening. Fine, don’t say anything. We’re thinking about moving in together. Déb, think this through. How long do you know this guy? A month or two? Take it easy! What's the rush? Who said it's a guy? Her name is Anaiane. We met in college and we're really enjoying each other. She owns a thrift store downtown and asked me to work with her. To manage it. I think it'll work out. What do you think? What is it, Daniel? Why the long face? What's going on, Sara? I called you over ten times, I texted. Are you ok? I'm worried. Pick up the phone. DID I DO SOMETHING TO HURT YOU? Hi, Daniel! I loved your last message. If I could, I'd teleport right into your arms too. This distance is terrible, right? I want to see all those places you talked about. If you ever come here, I'll take you to see the most beautiful place in the world! We’re just past 10 a.m. in Petrolina, the rural California Temperature is already at 38ºc. Our maximum for today should be 42ºc. Thermal sensation is about at 46ºc. Business trip? Vacation. Vacation? People often prefer to stay in Juazeiro or Petrolina.. They say there's the wineries, river bathing.. Can’t really go river bathing, right? And it's quieter around here too. What happened there? - Bike accident. - Right during your vacation. What a shame! I’ll let you rest now. If you drove all the way from the south you must be shattered. - Mrs. Arlete! - Yes? I'm coming! Do you know this woman by any chance? Never seen here before. - Is she from around here? - Yes. No... Never seen her. - You sure? - Never... Thank you! Another one. Do you know this woman? - I don't, why? - She's a friend of mine. Another round of caipirinha for us here, Mr. Silvio. - Not from around here, are you? - No. - Where are you from? - Curitiba. Are you lost? I'm looking for someone. You can sit with us if you'd like. Maybe we know this person you’re looking for. - It's quiet around here. - Too quiet, even. - Are you from around here? - I am. But I lived in Salvador for a while, after I married. - That didn’t work out. - How so? Not with the husband nor the city. I have a sister who still lives there, though. I took her along to help me around the house and... She ended up staying. - In the city and with the husband. - That sucks. Not at all. I got rid of two burdens at once. - What about you? Are you married? - Almost. - What's almost? A fiancée? - No, nothing like that. So what happened? She was quicker than you and got rid of her burden first. - That's my house right there. - This one? Ok, then. So you better go find your friend, right? Good luck! Hello? Hello? Finally, Daniel! Where are you? - I'm sorting some things out. - How can you just disappear like that? When are you coming back? I’m having to take dad to class with me. Do you have any idea? - And how’s he liking the teachers? - I'm serious, Daniel! I need this break, Déb. - Did you run away? Is that it? - Of course not. Your friend here was looking for you. You had to show up at the precinct. The commander is furious with you. He said he’ll arrest you if you don’t show up. - How's dad? - He's here. Watching TV. Are you giving him his medication? Changing his diapers? Dani. There was another news story about you. I'll send you the link, ok? Sending it now. - Did you get it? - I have to go, sis'. Take care, alright? TRAINING OR BARBARITY: INSTRUCTOR ASSAULTS RECRUIT AND TRIGGERS CONTROVERSY... - Have you ever seen this woman? - Around here? - No. - Thank you. Excuse me. Do you know this woman? - No. - Thank you. Do you know her? - Where's she from? - She lives right here in Sobradinho. Your call will be forwarded to voice mail and you may be charged after the tone. Sara, it's me Daniel. I came by surprise. I hope it's a good surprise. Remember how we used to dream about our meeting? Well, I'm here now. I don't know why you disappeared or stopped talking to me, but... I just need to understand. I... I need to see you. I drove across the entire country to see you. And I’m not leaving until I find you. So, please, pick up the phone. Hello? - Are you the one who's looking for Sara? - Who's speaking? I saw a poster with this phone number. Do you know Sara? What do you want with her? Can you tell me where she is? - Can you meet me later? - What for? - Do you want to meet this girl or not? - Where? Do you know the boats over in Juazeiro? 5pm over there. Fine. Hey. Were you the one that called me? - Where is she? - Really? Wait up! I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you. Listen... I have to cross over to Petrolina. - I can tell you about her, if you tag along. - Why can't you talk here? My brother... I have to make sure you’re not some pervert maniac. I have my car here. I can drive you. You don't get it, do you? What do you want with her? - You’re not helping me, we'll get there... - Have you ever fallen in love? What about that accent? - From the south. - Don't you have women down south? Yeah, but Sara's different. How is she different? She makes me feel different. I believe I'd do anything for her. - What do you do for a living? - Whatever they tell me to. What a mysterious man. - What about that arm? - Some stupid thing I did. That you did or someone told you to? This one's on my tab. Can you fix it? The arm at least. - Want to talk about it? - No. Look. Knife wound. My brother caught me with another man. Your brother did that? I'm just kidding. This happened when I fell from a horse. But what a shit story, right? So I made up this white lie, give it more flavor. And because, you know... The truth is rarely worth it, anyhow. So I made up this story with my brother. You could tell a different story about that arm. Give you some sparkle, put a smile on that face. Has she ever talked about me? Yes. What did she say? That you're sweet. But that you also scare her. Is that why she disappeared? You should ask her yourself. There's a nightclub called Vibe. She'll be there tonight. - Vibe? Are you sure? - I am. If I were you, I'd stay on the boat. Save your money, as the club is in Juazeiro. Girl, what was that? For the love of God, you went on all day about him. - Do you think anyone recognized me? - No. There’s no one from Sobradinho over there... And even if there were, you look completely different. You look beautiful. Sara, don't you think he's a bit of a freak? - He traveled two thousand miles after you. - You should've seen his face as he saw me. Take care, girl. You could get hurt. I know, Fernando. Don't you think I know that? And what about those posters? You're playing with fire. The way he talked about me on the boat, I almost felt like jumping into the fire. You're crazy. Come here. Lie down. Tell me something. Are you really liking this guy? He'd never accept me, right? Because he's stupid. Here. - Bye. Take care. - You too. Grandma? - I said you didn't have to wait up for me. - I wasn't waiting. - I was watching TV. - Well... I’ve never seen anyone watch TV with their eyes closed. - What time is it? - Time for bed. Let's go to bed. A blessing? - God bless you. - See you tomorrow. ♪ For Him, it's everything. ♪ Hallelujah, brothers! ♪ As what is His by Himself. ♪ ♪ For Him, it's everything. ♪ Hallelujah! ♪ To Him the glory... ♪ Amen, Jesus. ♪ To follow through. Amen. ♪ Brothers. Be wary, brothers. Be very wary of the enemy's traps. Because they are everywhere, all around, prowling us. Waiting for a slip-up. One single slip-up! But we, people of God! We must be a fortress! Like those erected in the desert. That you see from afar! And where the people gather around seeking shelter! - And Salvation... - Glory! Glory to God! - Your boy parked his car at my house. - Wait, what? I was coming home from the gym and saw his pickup truck there. - How does he know where you live? - How would I know? Isn't he a policeman? Relax, it probably wasn't even him. I’m staying at Adriano’s, but if I open the salon in the morning... Relax! I have to get back before grandma comes after me. Relax, everything's fine! - Don't freak out, girl. Kisses. - Kisses. - Have you ever left this place? - What? Left Bahia. Have you ever travelled away from here? Everyday, mister. I live on the other side of the bridge. - Pernambuco doesn’t count. - Of course it counts. And you? Have you ever left his place? I went to Salvador once with my father, but we didn't even see the beach. If you could travel anywhere, where would you go? That's easy. I'd go to Spain. - Why Spain? - To see Barcelona play at Camp Nou. And you? If you could take off, where would you go? Not sure. Anywhere far away from here. Well, that's easy, mister. You see all those trucks? Sneak inside one of those and don't even ask where it's headed. - How about it? - You're batshit crazy. - Come on, mister! - And give up this wonderful job here? You're crazy, right? Let's go? Adriano said I was imagining things, paranoid. So what did I do? I made us leave the house at 1 a.m. and head out to the salon. When we got there, where’s the damn pickup truck? Where's your boy? Nothing. Adriano just stared at me with his “I told you so” look on his face. And in the morning, when I opened the salon, guess who was at the door? Your boy. And what did he say? He said a bunch of stuff, asked a lot of questions. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost adopted him for myself. But then I saw his closeted bisexual eyes... And no. I told him to leave. I said only you could decide whether to contact him. I’m sorry I got you into this mess, Fer. Well, I was the one who wanted to talk to him on the boat. You’re my best friend, you know that right? Girl, I’m your only friend. - Stuck up bitch! - Damn right. - I’m going for a walk, ok? - Sure. Hello? Hello? Sara, I know it’s you. Hi, Daniel. I just want you to explain what's going on. I want you to stop pestering Fernando. You're scaring him. Are you two a couple? Is that it? It doesn’t matter, Daniel. I just want you to stop bothering him. I no longer recognize you, Daniel. I don’t know who you are anymore. Of course you do. You know me better than anyone. I saw a video with you on the Internet. That wasn’t the Daniel I used to talk to. I was scared. And the way you’re acting now is scaring me even more. I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize to me, Daniel. I won’t bother your friend again, I swear. But let’s meet, please! - And which Daniel will show up? - There's only one Daniel, Sara. We've been planning this encounter for so long. You owe me this. Please. ♪I beg your forgiveness once again♪ ♪if I messed up your life♪ ♪I'm not to blame if you cried♪ ♪if it didn't work out♪ ♪it was all in love's fault♪ ♪I don't know why♪ ♪this love came between us...♪ Hi. Could I have a glass, please? - Thank you. - Want some? You're quite a mystery, you know? What's with my face spread all over town? It was the only way to find you. It worked, right? That night at the club, I don't understand why you ran off. - I was scared, Daniel. - Of me? Of us. I was afraid of breaking the spell. - Why did you stop talking to me? - It's like I told you over the phone. - That video. - I’d never do that to you, Sara. But you did it with him. Can’t you see? I lost myself in repeating we can't disobey, we can't hesitate, think, feel... You end up believing it. They weren't the ones who beat up that kid. I know. During all this time we talked... My biggest fear was that... This moment would ruin everything. - Ruin what? - Everything we had. And what did we have, Sara? - Aren't you taking it off? That cast? - What did we have? What did it mean to you? - I don't know. I just know it was good. - Was? Why say it in the past? Isn't it no longer? I'm taking it off as soon as I get back. - And when's that? - Tomorrow. I just wanted to see you and understand why you gave up on us. Want a dance? Come. Do you hear that sound? Electricity. Sometimes I come here at night, close my eyes... And picture myself travelling far away, through these wires. Why did you lie to me? Did you know that Sobradinho, the real Sobradinho... lies hidden underneath all that water, behind these walls? That Sobradinho you know was built from scratch. My father said the new city was a second chance for it to go wrong. He never liked this place, yet he still sent me here. Answer me! I remember the day he took me to the bus station, shook my hand... Stared deep into my eyes and said: "Your grandma will fix you, son." "I couldn't, but your grandma will fix you." - Do you think I need fixing, Daniel? - Talk! Answer me! Are you going to hit me like that boy? Do you understand why I didn't want to see you? - Why didn't you say you were... - A what? What am I, Daniel? - Do you even know what I am? - You fooled me! No, Daniel. You’re the one fooling yourself. Did anyone see you like that on the street? No. You'd better get changed, you have to go to work. All day on Instagram, aren't you? Any plans for tonight? - Staying in. - Is that so? Let's go out dancing with us. Over at Tabuleiro. And listen to that crap you like? God forbid. Crap? I only listen to top-shelf shit. Hi, pastor. - The peace of the Lord, my son. - Amen! - Is everything alright, grandma? - Yes. Robson? Robson. This is brother Oswaldo, from Casa Nova, who I mentioned before. Peace of Christ, brother. Oswaldo, this is Robson. I'll leave you two alone so you can talk. Alright? I won't bite you, boy. Would you like to sit? Please. Do you know who that is? That was me, in 2002. Salvador. Barra do Marujo. Ever heard of it? Only the best would perform there. My hit performance was Tina Turner. I had a pair of thighs just like hers. You just had to see it. I had many pictures from back then. But I threw them all away. I only kept that flyer to remind me of the time I was lost in the world. You seem happy in that photo. Yeah. It took me a long time to learn... ...that salvation and happiness do not always walk hand in hand. Listen, Robson, there's a cure for what you have. - We've treated many people like you... - Do you think I'm sick? Are you happy with the life you lead? Are you? You left this in my car. - Wait! Let's talk. - We have nothing to talk about, Daniel. - You owe me an explanation. - Quiet down! I don't owe you anything. Where's the dress I gave you? - Really? - You bought it with my money, it's mine. I didn't ask you for that money, Daniel. Would you rather I knock on your door and ask your grandma? - It isn't here. I'll return it tomorrow. - And where is it? Calm down. - Boy, I have company. - Sorry, Fer. I need to fetch something. - Are you ok? - I'll explain later. Ok. Go. Don't go in my room! Aren't you coming in? Fer, come here. Why are you wearing this? I wanted you to see me wearing it, at least once. Give me that dress, Sara. - Déb? - Daniel? What's the matter? - Let me talk to dad. - What do you mean, Daniel? He's sleeping. - Then wake him up. - Why do you want to talk to dad, Daniel? Do it. Fine. Hold on. - There. He's on speaker. - Let me talk to him alone. - Dani... - It's alright. Let me talk to him alone. Ok. Dad? I... I wanted... I wanted to return this. I'm leaving now. Please, take it. Daniel. I want to show you a place before you leave. My grandfather worked on the construction of this dam. His plan was to stay a while, earn some money, and return. But then he met my grandmother. He quit engineering, became a fisherman and never again stepped foot in Natal. He'd bring me here and say that a man can achieve anything he wants. Even control a river this large. My grandmother believes that the will of men is worthless without God's permission. My grandfather didn't agree, but respected her. She also never understood the anger he felt towards God. But they loved each other immensely, so she brushed it off. My father's faith was in justice, and my military grandfather in the homeland. What about yours? Mine died when I was 17. Your mother, right? Do you miss her? I miss my grandfather too. The other day, you asked me who you are to me. You've always been Sara. But the truth is I don't know who you are. I'm exactly what you see, Daniel. Sara, Robson, so many things. I'm just like that lake down there. A stream of water about to burst and run wild. And you? Who are you, Daniel? Before coming here, I thought I knew. Bye. Grandma? Hi, son. Why is this suitcase here? Sit down, Robson. Remember when your father brought you here after that beating? I promised myself that day I'd never let anyone else hurt you. Pastor Ailton. He's threatening to tell everyone at Church if you don't accept the treatment. I've spoken to your mother. She'll be waiting for you at Feira's bus station. I don't want to go, grandma. I don't want to see my father. Listen to me, Robson. It's for your own good. Go. Are you sure you don't want to stay? You could help me out with the salon. I was saving this for an emergency. - Then keep saving for your emergency. - This is an emergency. I’ll miss you, girl. Attention passengers bound for Feira de Santana. Sobradinho - Feira de Santana. Boarding 22:30. Last call, platform 3. - Hi. - Hello. - I’d like a ticket to Rio de Janeiro. - Last bus leaves at 10 p.m. Next one is tomorrow at 7 a.m. - I'll have that ticket. How much? - R$ 370. ID, please. Fernando said you'd be here. I thought you were already gone. Maybe I'll stay and become a fisherman. Just like your grandfather. - Where are you going? - Rio de Janeiro. You got any relatives there? And what will you do over there? Try and live my life. Why Rio? - Because it's beautiful. - It’s beautiful here too. Yeah. But you screwed that up with those posters, right? I'm sorry. You can't go on acting as if saying sorry fixes everything, Daniel. I know, but it's all I have right now. I'm sorry. What do you want, Daniel? And you? What do you want?
