(people chattering) Give me a kiss, give me a Kiss. (cross talk) - That's good. - This is so much fun. Those guys. I'm Ralph. - Ralph. - Ralph. (indistinct chatter) (engine rumbling) Here you go. - Oh, great. - Now, come on. You tell me this isn't better than any frat party on Halloween, huh? This is gonna be the best Halloween you guys had. I'm telling ya. (engine rumbling) (indistinct chatter) [Sally] I can't wait to get (indistinct). (distant chatter) (engine rumbling) - Where's he taking us? - Sally's hiding a beer over there. - I don't know, this is a long ride. - I know. - Yeah, well... - I hope we don't get too cold tonight. - I know, I tell ya. - I don't have a jacket. - No one wants to share. Hand me over another beer, would you, please? Please? (cross talk) (laughing and chatter) (engine rumbling) I'm tired of being the one supplying all the time. (group laughing) (indistinct cross chatter) We're gonna build a fire. First thing we're gonna do is build a big fire. - Yeah. (indistinct chatter and laughing) - It's beautiful. - There we go. - Finally. - This is a great idea. Hey, don't forget the cooler. I got the beers, I got the beers. All right. Lisa, grab the radio, please. Anything else? And the sweatshirt. Oh, how sweet. There you go. Come on off, Kim. (thuds on ground) Come on, I got you. There you go. You know, I'll bet these woods get pretty goddamn scary at night. Who knows what might happen to us up here? (ominous synth music) Remember Sammy Perkins? - Yeah. Sammy and his girlfriend came up here about a year or so ago to go parking. Nobody's ever seen them since then. Sammy joined the Army. Yeah, and his girlfriend Janie got pregnant, went to Virginia to have the baby at her aunt's. That's what everybody thinks, but a good source told me that they were murdered right up here. (laughing) This guy is full of shit. The story goes like this. Old man Spence's dog came home one day with a man's hand in his mouth. And on it was a class ring with the initials S.H.P. Those are -- or should I say were -- Sammy's initials. Why don't you knock it off, Eddie? Talk about something else. Yeah, she's right. Why don't you save the horror stories for around the campfire? (leaves rustling) What's gotten into her? Hey, Lise, why don't you give our friend Eddie some of this, huh? Maybe he'll get stoned and fall asleep and we won't have to listen to him anymore. No, thanks. - Here. - Hey. Why don't you ever kiss me like that? Well, maybe if you had tits like her, I would. Go to hell. Hey, Lise. Give me a break, will ya? Here, this ought to cool you off. (can spraying) You asshole, Eddie. This is a brand new blouse. Grow up, Eddie, will ya? What an asshole. (leaves rustling) (metal clangs) (engine rumbling) (engine revving) (engine cuts) (leaves rustling) (ominous synth music) (leaves rustling) (ominous synth cont.) What the hell is this? (leaves rustling) (ominous synth cont.) Goddamn college kids on my property again. (leaves rustling) (ominous synth cont.) What the hell is this? Some kind of joke?

(people chattering) (rock music) (ominous synth music) (growling) (birds chirping) (grass rustling) Give me that blanket. Help me. (hay rustling) That's good. Come on. I've been waiting all day to be alone with you. What's your hurry? We got all night. Why are you holding back? Didn't you want to be with me? It's not that, it's just... everything is going so fast. This is our first night out, you know. Are you saying I'm too pushy for you? A little. It's just... I don't think I'm ready to get serious with anybody right now. Who said anything about getting serious? I just wanted to get together with you and have some fun, you know, fool around. First time I met you at Julie's party, I wanted to be with you. Well, maybe you don't understand what I'm trying to say, but when Julie fixed us up to go on this hayride together, I was really excited about it. I mean, you are really cute. And I haven't been out with a lot of girls. I just never had any girl treat me the way you have. Well, I'm sorry. I don't mean to come on so strong, but it's just that I really like you, and I want you to know it, you know. So why don't you come a little closer? Come here. (hay rustling) (birds chirping in distance) (woman breathing heavily) (door thuds) Did you hear that? Something's in here. (ominous synth music) I'll bet it's that damn Eddie. If it is, I'm gonna Kill him. Is that you, Eddie? Little pervert. You think you'd sneak in here and get yourself a cheap thrill? Get out of here, Eddie. (ominous synth music) (growling) I don't know who the fuck you are, man. Get out of here. (yelling) (body thuds) No, no... No! (growling) (dramatic synth music) Oh, shit! (growling) No, no! (yelling) (grunting, choking) (dramatic synth music) (growling) (gasping) (growling) (intense synth music) (group chattering and laughing) You guys want to play Frisbee or something later? What do you think? - Yeah, yeah. - Is that bullshit or what? No, it's real nice out there. Yeah, why not? We can do that later. - lt is. Later. We're here to drink beers. Who got the beer, anyway? (indistinct chatter) Yeah, could you throw me one, please? Sure. (chatter and laughter) I'm not kidding. It's okay. Yeah, quit your complaining, will you? It's gone. - Yeah, it is. What can I say, I started it down there. Well, I don't know. Hey, Lise, you better make sure Ralph doesn't drink all the beer. (laughing) He's been going at it pretty good ever since the hayride. (laughing and chatter) Eddie, you asshole. (laughing) You're stupid. (group chatter) Before you get too comfortable, I suggest you gather up some firewood. - Yeah, firewood. - That's not a bad idea. What time are you coming back to pick us up, anyway? It's up to you. I can pick you up anytime from midnight 'til tomorrow morning. Yeah, tomorrow morning sounds good. (laughing) If you want to stay here tonight, that's fine by me. But I'd like to warn you that it gets mighty cold up here, and all you have is those blankets. Well, Carrie and Bill could stay warm in a snowstorm. (laughing) But I'm not sure about the rest of us. Tell you what, I'll come back at midnight. You tell me by then, okay? All right, that sounds good. (leaves rustling) Well, better go get some firewood. I ain't getting no firewood without some beer. Hey, Kim, right here. Here you go. (group chatter) (leaves rustling) I'm not carrying it. Come on, please. - Or else what? - You can carry this. I'm always carrying everything. Well, show me where there's lots. Well, there's lots. There's a good one, right over here. - Aw, babe. We can't even use that for kindling. Yeah, look, it's good, it's old. This is good and old. - Now, give it here. I'll break it. - Thanks. Did you hear that? (growling) (intense synth music) Hey, it's only me. Man. (laughing) Eddie, you really are an asshole. Did you know that? Oh, I scared you, didn't I? Yeah, well, you're a real jerk, you know, man? Why don't you just stop playing your games and give us some help here? Oh, excuse me, boss. You see, I must have come up here with the wrong impression. I thought we were here to have fun. Yeah, well, you call that fun? Yeah. Here, carry that. (leaves rustling) (leaves rustling) (engine stutters) Come on, damn it. (engine stutters) Shit. (birds chirping) (dramatic synth music) You scared the shit out of me. Oh, hey, man. I didn't mean to scare you that way. Well, you did. Sorry. Listen, we're going through beer a little faster than we figured back there. Any chance you'd bring us back a couple six packs when you come back later? Sure, why not? (leaves rustling) Kids. You didn't bother me, but you scared Lisa. You know what I mean? He didn't mean anything by it. It's only a joke. Come on, we're up here for fun. Hey, it was pretty serious. (group chatter) Well, you take care of the beer? It's handled. He's gonna bring back a couple six packs. - All right. - Aw, damn. I should have asked him to get me cigarettes, too. Well, I haven't heard the tractor start yet. Do you want me to try and catch him? No, no, sit down. Sit down, relax. I'll do it. I need smokes, too. What kind do you want, Kim? Kool, thanks. Kool. (group chattering) Did I miss anything? (leaves rustling) (ominous synth music) Now what? (choking) (growling) (ominous synth music) (growling) (screaming) - Hey, Eddie. Eddie. - What? How long has Lisa been gone? - Take a walk. - I don't know, it's been a while. Hey guys, I think I'm gonna go check it out. See where she is, all right? - All right. - I'll be back. - Be careful. - I will. (leaves rustling) (intense synth music) (growling) (screaming) (Lisa screaming) - What the hell? - Lisa! (leaves rustling) (intense synth cont.) (growling) (grunting) (body thuds) (stick thuds) (growling) (intense synth cont.) Bob! Kim! Oh, man... (gasping) God, what happened to her? Something attacked her in the woods, man. Look at her shoulder. It bit right through her. Shit, she's bleeding bad. We gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here now. What about that farm house we passed? Whatever we gotta do, we gotta do it quick, man. Come on, go! Wait, what about Bill and Carrie? Oh, Jesus, I forgot about them. Look, take her up to the farm house. Me and Sally are gonna go get Bill and Carrie. We'll meet you there. All right, be careful. Come on you guys, go! - Come on. Go! Tony, help me out, please. (chatter) (intense synth cont.) (intense synth music) (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) (intense synth cont.) Carrie, Bill! Carrie? Bill? (gasping) Oh, God. (growling) (dramatic synth music) Jesus Christ. Sally, come on, let's get out of here. (suspenseful music) Let's go. Hold her tight, come on. Come on. - Slow down, Tony. Slow down. - Come on, come on. Hold on, baby, we're almost there. Come on, I got you. I got you, come on. Come on, you're there. - It's gonna be all right. Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) Tony, run ahead and get the door. - All right. - Let's go, hurry up. Come on! Come on! - All right. - You're gonna be all right. - Come on. You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be okay. Let's go, come on. (door opens) Let's go! Fucking bit right into her shoulder. Get her in here, get her in here. (door slams) Everybody in, shut the door. Come on, baby, come on. (gasping) Come on, all right, in here on the table. Let's go, honey, I got you. On the table, lay on the table. Kim, help me out, please. (gasping) Move her back some. Oh, Jesus Christ. (gasping) You're okay. Hey, Julie, what I want you to do Is look around the place, okay? Find anything we can use for weapons, all right? You guys, come on, there's gotta be some hammer and nails around here. Find it, board up the front door. Tony, you count all the windows and board them up, too, all right? All right. Here. Got some nails, here. - All right. - Go board those things up. (tense music) - Look what I found. - Oh, fantastic. Tony, make sure you board up that door first. Hey, you can't do that. What about Bob and Sally and the others? You can't leave them out there. - The hell we can't. - Eddie! They should have been here by now. Tony, board it up. Now. Lift your head up, Kim. (Kim gasping) You gotta do something. Hold on, babe. Hold on. We're gonna have to stop that blood somehow. Give me your band an a. (gasping) Lise, baby, come on. (gasping) (shushing) Come on now. Put it on, put it on it. Just hold it down, hold it tight. Hold on tight. I know it's gonna hurt, baby. You gotta take it, hon. Come on, it's gonna be all right. Just hold on. Hold on to me. Lisa, Lisa! Oh, baby. (hammering) (indistinct chatter) Get that window. Go get some nails and some boards for that window. Go get that thing taken care of. Okay, all right. (tense music) (door pounds) What the hell? Ralph, open the door. (bangs on door) - No! - Come on, man. These things are right behind us. It's too late! Go find someplace else to hide! Oh, you bastard! (bangs on door) (ominous synth music) Come on. That fucking Eddie. When we get out of here, I'm gonna Kill him. What's happening? What's going on? I don't understand. Was Carrie dead? Yeah, and Bill too. I don't understand what's going on. But we're safe down here. We'll be all right. Eddie, what's going down? Nothing. Who was at the door? No one. Man, I heard you talking to somebody. Who was at the door? It was Bob and Sally. Why the fuck didn't you let them in? We can't. Those things are too close. We can't take the chance. What are you talking about, man? You're crazy. - Ralph, no. You son of a bitch. You're gonna leave them out there to die? Those things are too close. We can't take the chance. You mother -- You bastard. Get away, or I swear to Christ, I'll shoot you. Yeah? How's that, boy? (body thuds) Huh? How's it feel being on the other side of the gun? - Ralph... - I ought to blow your fucking head off. - Don't do it. Don't do it. Eddie, come here, hurry up! What's up? Ralph, this phone works. There's a dial tone. You gotta be shitting me. On... all right! (phone dialing) Come on. (phone ringing) (ominous synth music) 911 is your emergency or medical assistant, how can I help you? Hello, I know this is gonna sound a little screwy to you, all right? But there were a bunch of us, and we were at Spence's farm, which is off of Route 5, and we were taking a hayride, and we were attacked. [Dispatcher] Attacked? We were attacked by some kind of a -- - Man. - We were attacked by a man. Some kind of a lunatic. It was a monster. Some kind of a monster. Now, was this monster a Godzilla type, or a Frankenstein type monster? Look, I don't have the time to be jerked around right now. You have got to believe me. Just send somebody out to Spence's farm on Route 5, please. Sir, it is Halloween. If I send an officer out there and we find out it is a prank, you're gonna be in more trouble, I assure you, than any monster could ever give you. This is no prank, okay? Could you just believe me and send a policeman or somebody out to Route 5? 7 Spence's farm. My girlfriend's been hurt. The least you can do is send an ambulance. There's a bunch of us. We're holed up in some old kind of farm house here. (phone line rips) No... (dial tone) (phone thuds) The line went dead. Oh, no. Well, finish boarding up the windows. All right. (hammering nail) (nails clatter) (hammering nail) No way those things are gonna get my ass, no way in the world. (hammering cont.) Hey, Lise. Has the bleeding stopped at all? I think so, but she's still unconscious. - Jesus Christ. - Let me get this over her. You're gonna need this. That's okay, she needs it more. She might be okay if help comes. (hammering) All right, that should hold it. God, Tony, I'm so scared. Oh, I know. Look, I'm sure everything's gonna be all right, okay? Do you really think that's gonna keep them out? I'm sure it is. And somebody's gotta be on the way. I hope so. Look, I'm gonna go and make sure everything else is secure, all right? - Okay. - Okay. (smashing window) (screaming) (tense synth music) Tony! Ralph, get in here! (smacking) Shit! Move out the way. - Shoot her out! Move out of the way and I'll shoot her! Move it! Oh god, it's Carrie! (growling) Well, get the fuck out the way, I'll shoot! Shit. (door pounds) (yelling) Ralph! Ralph! (door bursting open) Shit. (gun fires) That sounded like a gun shot. Where did they get the gun? I don't know, but maybe they'll kill those things off. All right, now you board up that door now! (tense synth cont.) Tony, get in there and help Eddie. Right. Was that Carrie? No, she must have ran off. That was the driver, I think. Came right in through the door. Well, did you Kill him? (hammering) What do you mean, did I kill him? Aren't they already dead? I don't know, I shot him right in the face. Isn't that enough? Do you think help's gonna get here? (hammering in background) Look, Julie. We called, all right? If they're gonna come, they're gonna come soon, okay? (suspenseful synth music) (window smashes) (growling) (screaming) Oh, my god! (suspenseful synth cont.) (yelling, growling) Kim! Jesus Christ, Kim! Kim! (tense synth music) (growling) No, no! (gurgling) Shit. (suspenseful synth music) Oh, my god!

(growling) (screaming) (grunting) (tense synth music) (smacking, growling) (screaming) (snarling) (cables thudding) Oh, it's horrible. I feel so scared. (thudding, rumbling) (gasping) (shushing) We gotta keep quiet. Harv, come in, please. Yeah, Terrie. Harv, this is dispatch. We seem to be getting a report of some disturbance on old man Spence's farm. Spence's farm? Yeah, we want you to go down and take a look, okay? Some crazy kid called here and said he and his friends were holed up in a tool shed, and they were being attacked by some monster. Sounds wild. It's probably a crank, 'cause it is Halloween, but he did sound serious. We may have some kind of trouble out there. Okay, I'll check it out. Yeah, keep an eye out for old man Gornick's son, too. He was driving some kind of a hay wagon this morning and he just vanished. His mom called and said he never came home, so there might be some kind of trouble out there, I don't know. Okay, you got it. Thanks, Harv. (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) (ominous piano music) (door slams) (water running) (tapping bowl) Chris, mom told you to wait. Who cares? You're gonna get in trouble. (footsteps tapping) Oh, Chris, I asked you to wait until I was finished with your sister. Look at the mess you're making. Now we've gotta hurry up. Okay, let's put a little bit of this on and we'll be all ready to go. (ominous piano music) (water running) (door squeaks) (ominous piano cont.) (ominous piano music) (hair dryer blowing) (ominous synth music) What's taking Susan so long? I think she's in the shower. I heard water running. I'll be right back. (footsteps) (ominous synth music) Susan! Susan, can you hear me? (hair dryer blowing) Yes, I heard you. Please hurry. The Kids are anxious to go and I need you to answer the door for me til my husband gets home. I'll be down in a minute. (hair dryer blowing) (ominous synth cont.) Do you want a caramel apple? Yeah. I'll get it for you. No, no, no, no, no. Not two messes now this evening. Later, we'll do that later. Okay, Heidi, let me put a little bit of this on you, and we'll be all ready to go. (knock on door) Damn, the trick-or-treaters are here already. Aw, can I get it, please? I want to see how they're dressed. Okay, honey. The candy's in the basket by the front door. But just one piece of candy for each trick-or-treater. Okay? - Okay. (ominous synth music) Wow. You're supposed to say, "Trick or treat!" (growling) (Heidi screams) (candy thuds) (growling, snarling) I'm gonna go check on Heidi. I'll be right back. (suspenseful synth music) Heidi! Oh, god, Heidi! (growling) (screaming) Mom! (growling) (tense synth music) (door thuds) (growling, yelling) (suspenseful synth music) (screaming) (growling, snarling) (thuds) (growling, gasping) (screaming) (tense synth music) (fabric tearing) (snarling) (tense synth music) (engine humming) (car door slams) (crickets chirping) (ominous synth music) Susan. Susan? (ominous synth music) Susan? (knocking on door) Susan? Oh, my god. Susan. Oh... (tense synth music) Jesus Christ. (growling) (all snarling) Oh, god, no. (growling) Terrie, I'm getting out of the car now. (crickets chirping) (ominous synth music) Oh, Jesus. (snarling, growling) Halt! (snarling) Halt! (hissing) (gun fires) (growling) (gun fires) (body thuds) (snarling, growling) (gun fires) (body thuds) (gasping) (tense synth music) (door slams) Terrie! Goddamn it, Terrie, open the radio! (snarling, growling) Please, get on the radio. I need help quick. I'm at Spence's farm. These kids have turned into maniacs. They're trying to kill my ass! (suspenseful synth music) (growling, snarling) (gun fires) Send help! I'm wounded and these kids are not human! I shot one in the chest, but it never fazed him. I shot two in the head and I think they're dead. (smashing window) (screaming) (window smashing) (tense synth music) (screaming) (snarling, growling) Harv, Harv, come in! (dialing phone) Vince, Vince? This is Terrie from dispatch. Yes, I sent Harv out to Spence's farm for a disturbance and he called. I think he shot someone, or someone shot him. I don't know, I lost contact with him. I don't know. He might be dead. Something's really... Okay, red ball it. (ominous synth music) (crickets chirping) (cellar door thuds) (suspenseful synth music) Come on. (gasping) Jesus. (tense synth music) (growling) (gun fires) Damn. (items rustling) Did we have a lot of trick-or-treaters tonight? More than I expected. The Jenkins kids were here again. Jeez. So... so how long ago did you run out of candy? Must have been about half an hour before trick-or-treat was over. And by the way, are you gonna feed the horses tonight, or do I have to do it again? Yeah, I'm gonna feed the horses. I have my stuff right here. Thank you. (silverware clinks) (clothes rustling) (mug thuds) (faucet runs) (silverware clinks) (door slams) (ominous piano music) (footsteps) (ominous music cont.) (gate rattles) (gravel rustling) (horse huffs) (gasping) Wait. You all right? - Yeah. - Let's go, come on. Wait. How do we know he's not one of those things? We don't, but we gotta take a chance. We gotta talk to somebody. Come on. (suspenseful synth music) (horse whinnies) Hey! (gasping) What the hell do you kids think you're doing here? - You gotta help us! - Please, you gotta help us. - Help you? - We were up at the campsite. - We're being chased. - And our friends -- - Monsters or something. - They're all -- Wait a minute, who's after you? - Our friends. - The monsters. - They've all got killed. - They're trying to eat us. - Monsters? Wait a minute now. - They're killing our friends. Is this a Halloween gag, or what? - It's no gag! - This isn't any gag, man. You gotta help us! They're coming! - They're chasing us. You gotta get us out of here. There's something in the woods. And they're all coming this way. Wait a minute, you're serious, aren't you? - Yes! - I'm telling you, they're coming after us. You gotta get us to a phone. There's police up here, they couldn't help us. Hold it, hold it. How'd you cut your face? - Listen, I'm okay. - She's all right. You just need to get us out of here. - Get us to a phone. - Please, please. - That's all. We just gotta get out of here. Listen, I'll let you go up to the house and use the phone. - Good. We can straighten that out up there, all right? Now, come on. This better not be any kind of Halloween trick-or-treat thing. (ominous piano music) A Beaver County couple was charged with running a sophisticated prostitution service that let clients charge their bill on Visa and MasterCard. - Look at this. [Newscaster] The couple, Josephine (indistinct), surrendered to be with police today. I'm not giving that to 'em, you give that to 'em. An escort service. But the grand jury presentment alleges the escort service was a prostitution operation. The Coraopolis Borough Water Authority will raise its rates 18% next year, and that means a typical customer will pay $48 more a year. The increase would pay for more than one and a quarter million dollar improvements needed by the water authority. Two homes were destroyed in fire last night in Chippewa and the cause of the blaze is under investigation. There is suspicion on this one. It started in a home at 181 South Hope Street and spread very quickly. It burned about four hours before being brought under control. Total damage is listed at $80,000. Fortunately, there were no injuries. And out. Break, 30 seconds. (indistinct chatter) - Your hair looks fine. - Great. - Check your makeup. - Oh, thanks, Cookie. I'm as pretty as I want to get. (laughing) Oh, boy. I think I'm gonna let you read this one. What? [Producer] Standby, coming up on one, please. Oh, thanks. [Producer] And... We've just received (ominous synth music) What this newscaster thinks is a very strange and unconfirmed report. I repeat, unconfirmed report. (door slams) The Beaver Police Department-- - Jackie? Informed us there have been reports of some attacks by what they refer to as people that appear to be dead. As I said, we've not been able to verify these bizarre claims, and as we all know, it is Halloween night, but just to be cautious, we are asking that anyone seeing any suspicious looking character on or around their houses (growling) To call the Beaver Police Department. Jesus H. Christ. (suspenseful synth music) - Oh, no. - Holy shit! How did she get in the house? What the...? (growling) (suspenseful synth music) Quick, save yourselves. Get out of here! (gun cocking) (feet stamping) (growling) (suspenseful synth music) (gun fires) (growling) (screaming) (choking) (newscaster chattering) (growling, snarling) (people chattering, laughing) (nozzle sprays) (pop music in background) So where the hell is everyone else at?

I'm gonna go over here and drink with those guys. (ballad plays on radio) What's the matter? Can't your boyfriend handle his beer? He flunked two of his exams the other day. I think he's trying to get rid of his frustrations. Well, you know, a few frustrations you know you'd like to get rid of. I think I could take you under my wing. Knock it off. Save your passes for the football field on Saturday. Where's your date, anyway? I don't know, she's around somewhere. Well, I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate you hitting on me while she's gone, would she? She doesn't care, she loves me. Well, it bothers me. ♪ Starting over ♪ This is a really great party.

(hay rustling) You know, my roommate didn't even want to come to this party tonight. She said all you football guys would do nothing but drink beer and rape us girls. Yeah, well, your roommate don't know nothing. Yeah, it's like when I went off to college. My dad said I better watch myself. You know, with all those guys around. Yeah, well, your father don't know nothing, either. Yeah, I guess I can take care of myself. It's not like I'm loose or anything. I'm particular about who I go out with. I don't just date anyone, Paul. Paul? Steve. My name's Steve. Yeah. Steve. I meant Steve. I don't even know a Paul. Oh, yeah, right. Come here. (hay rustling) (music in distance) (panting) Sounds like a party. No, they're not gonna believe us. We'll make them believe us. We have to. No one else has to die tonight, I promise you that. Are you okay? Yes. No. I'm scared to death. I guess I'm all right, though. Look. We're gonna make it. We've come too far to give up now. I can't take much more of this. I really can't. Sally, I love you. I love you, too. Come on. (footsteps pattering) Andy, do you realize your buddy Scott is hitting on me? He was just drunk. He's drunk? What about you? Well, somebody has to drink all this beer. Just because some people didn't come to your party, Andy, is no reason for you to get so drunk that you spoil it for me and everybody else. (radio DJ chattering) I went through a lot of trouble to put this party together. I don't hear anyone else complaining. You're just complaining, and I'm not drunk. Andy, you're drinking too much. Come on, just lay down. Andy, come on. - Leave me alone, leave me alone. - You're drinking too -- Hey, listen, we need your help. We were with all our friends, and we were attacked by -- - Let me explain. Now, this is gonna sound very strange, but you've got to believe us. Who the hell are you guys? What are you doing here? I didn't invite you. Where are your costumes? You look like shit. - Look, I know we weren't invited, but -- - Then what the hell are you doing here? Shut up, Andy. Let him talk. Look, we need your help. There's these people out there, they're crazy, killers. They're all over the place. They killed all of our friends. Look, they killed a cop and some friends of ours. They're heading down this way now. Oh, if they're in costume, they can come in. If not, get the hell out. Look, this is no joke. Look, do you have a phone? Is there anybody's car we can borrow? - A car? - Just... haven't you been listening to the news? It's all over the news! - It was on the television. We saw it. - Come on. There's people everywhere. It's not gonna be long until they're here. I think you've seen just one too many cheesy zombie flicks, pal. What in the hell is with them? Oh, they're just a bunch of losers that crashed the party. Some people died tonight. We're not lying to you. There's something out there on Spence's farm. And it's gonna come up here. You can't let them get you. - They aren't even in costume. Ah, here's a great costume. Hello, my darling. Come dance with me and I will suck your blood. (growling) (screaming) Oh, my god! (screaming) They're here. (screaming) (feet stamping) (yelling in distance) Come on. This looks like a good place to hide. Oh, my god. (screaming in distance) (growling) (suspenseful synth music) (growling, hissing) (yelling, screaming) (growling) (wailing) (girls screaming) (thudding, pounding) (wailing, gasping) (growling) (suspenseful synth music) (screaming) (growling) (screaming) (suspenseful synth music) (distant screaming) Oh, that damn Andy. Probably started another fight. I'm gonna go check it out. Why don't you stay here. Stay in the mood. - Sure. (hay rustling) (all screaming) (intense synth music) What the...? (fist thuds) (growling) (growling) (screaming) (intense synth music) (screaming, growling) [Mad Mike on Radio] Hey, kids. Listen to this. We interrupt our four in a row with a news hit -- (screaming) Of the dead walking the earth. From Beaver County. The zombies are on the prowl. Hungry for living flesh. So if a ghoul invites you to dance, just say no. (laughing) (ominous synth music) Give me your attention, men. I want you to understand we have a dangerous situation here. I've already lost one man. Most of you knew Harv Morgan. I want to get those things that killed him. Now, we're gonna split into groups. No less than two people to a group. We're gonna head west until we meet up with a group coming from the east with Deputy Garing. What are we looking for? Yeah, Sheriff, what are these things? They're dead things. They're dead and they're attacking people, killing them. Eating parts of their bodies. Believe me, I saw what was left of Harv, and I don't want anyone taking any chances with these things. What I want you to do is get out there and kill 'em. Don't try taking any prisoners. Once you see 'em, shoot 'em dead. Now, the last message Harv got through to the dispatch was that you had to shoot 'em in the head to kill them. Hitting "em anywhere else is not effective. So aim for their heads, shoot to Kill. Even if it's somebody you used to know. Remember, they're dead and they're dangerous. If you don't Kill them, they'll Kill you. Don't anyone wander off by themselves. We want no mistakes and no people getting killed. Once you see 'em, shoot 'em dead. Vince, what I want you to do IS go up on top of the hill over there, use the scope. Look around. You see anything, yell down to us. The rest of you, now, we're gonna go off to the west, break off in groups of threes and scan this field. All right, let's go. (men chattering) Deputy Garing. My group's heading your way. Start yours out now. Send a couple men up to check out the Dodi house on Lonkard Hill. [Deputy] Okay, Sheriff, I'll start them out now. Make sure Sergeant Mitch takes his group out to check the Zipid Farm and Doc Petragula's place. I want it cleared all the way to Manns Creek -- (gravel rustles) (doors open) [Deputy] Okay. [Sheriff] Base, base! (doors slam) Come in, base. [Dave] Base, Sheriff. [Sheriff] Dave, who the hell let those news people through? I told you, nobody passes those road blocks without my okay, damn it. Now, follow orders. Nobody else through without my authorization. You got that, Dave? [Dave] Got it, Sheriff. (gravel rustling) What's going on here, Sheriff? Basically, all I can tell you is we got some things running around out there killing people and we're trying to get it under control. What are these "things," as you call them? Right now, I couldn't tell you precisely. You know, you're being pretty vague about all this, Sheriff. Well, I can't be any more precise than I've been. We just don't know right now. Well, do you suppose this has any connection to reports we had years back about a Satanic cult that was operating out here at Spence's Farm, and as I remember, there was reports of human sacrifices and other occult occurrences. Well, I was just a rookie on the force when all that happened, so I really couldn't answer. Although, we do have somebody investigating that right now. Do you have any idea how many you've killed so far? I couldn't give you an exact number, but quite a few. Now, these things, as you refer to them, I understand they may be local Kids. Shut that damn camera off. We don't know whether they're kids or not, and we can't put that out. Otherwise, we'll have every parent in the county down here. Now, what we need is to get the situation under control. Once we do that, I'll be happy to answer any question you have. Now shut that off. (ominous synth music) All right, think we're gonna get any of those things today, guys? I sure hope so. I sure hope. I don't even know what one looks like. I don't know, can we get 'em now? Until after we kill them? - Oh, I'd love that. - Lovely idea, Yeah, yeah. - What are we looking for? - Wait, hold it, guys. Hold it. (ominous synth music) I think I see something. Hey, there's two of 'em. - Yeah! Let's get the bastards. (guns firing) (growling) Well guys, should we go gut 'em? - Yeah, let's get 'em. - Let's get 'em. (growling) (guns firing) (grass rustling) (growling) There's one. (guns firing) (wheat rustling) (ominous synth music) Jack, check that one out with your scope. That's one of 'em, whatever the hell it is. (guns firing) (growling) (ominous synth cont.) (growling, snarling) (guns firing) (growling) Shit, there's one now! Get him! (guns firing) (grass rustling) (ominous synth cont.) Look, there's one now. (growling) Shoot, shoot! Don't shoot her. It's my daughter, for Christ's sake. Shoot! (guns firing) (guns firing) (growling) (body thuds) (footsteps in gravel) (ominous synth music) Look at the blood here. Somebody bought it here. That's for sure, man. (ominous synth cont.) Watch out, look! What? Shoot her, damn it! (gun fires) Good shot. I'm gonna go out and see if that thing is dead. Yeah, good idea. (ominous synth music) (growling) Holy shit! (gun fires) (body thuds) What, did you get another one? - Damn Kid. - A Kid? Yeah. Why don't you go and check out the house and I'll go around back. (ominous synth cont.) Oh, what a mess. (growling, snarling) (flies buzzing) (growling) (gun fires) (ominous synth music) (birds chirping) You okay, sweetheart? (growling, hissing) (gun fires) (body thuds) (child zombie whimpering) (tense music) (gun fires) (gun fires in distance) (suspenseful synth music) Hold me. Oh, you're shaking. It's cold, I'm scared. Just a little while longer. We're almost out of this mess. We're almost home. Home... I had an argument with my mother before I left. She didn't want me to go on the hayride. She thought some of the guys might cause trouble. Some of the guys? Like me, huh? Bob, there's something about me that you should know. What? What's wrong? It's just that I care about you. And being with you isn't like being with anybody else. You know, I've never met anyone like you, either. How long has it been now? What, a year? Almost two. But listen to me a minute. I think you're the one. One? One what? The one I want to marry. You know what? I feel the same way, too. I mean it, I really mean it. I depend on you. I trust you. I Know you're gonna get us out of here. Let's go away someplace. Forget about everything that's happened. Do you want to go away with me? Sure, baby. Where do you want to go? How about Tampa? Remember last summer? Remember how much fun we had? Remember how sunburned you got? Tampa would be a nice place to have kids. Have so much fun. Take real family vacations. Oh, yeah. That sounds so nice. As soon as we get out of here. The future lies ahead. Isn't that what your sorority motto is? Yeah, the future. I can hardly wait. (soft music) Sweetheart. I think the shooting has stopped. Come on, I think it's safe now. No, no. I just want to stay here with you for a little while longer. Come on, think of all the things we have to do. All the plans we're gonna make. Yeah, it's gonna be great. It's gonna be great, isn't it, Bob? We're gonna be so happy, I know it. Oh, yeah. Very happy. Come on. (ominous synth music) Come on. Hey, Jim, did your men see any on the other side of that field there? No. Did you see any, Vince? I didn't see anything, didn't get anything. Vince, there's two over there. I'll get 'em. (gun fires) (body thuds) Oh, no! Jesus Christ, no! Don't shoot, no! (gun fires) Good shot, Vince. Yeah, I'm getting pretty good at this. I wonder if there's any more around here. Okay, I understand. We're on our way. That was Vince. He just saw two coming out of that barn up there. That whole damn place must be full of 'em. Be a good idea to torch that thing. Why don't you two go start on it? All right? Dave, send the fire trucks in. I'm going to torch this barn down here, and I don't want the fire getting out of control. [Dave] 10-4. (ominous piano music) Sheriff, the Chief's been notified. Okay, Dave, be a good idea to send an ambulance down with it. If it's back here, send it on down. [Dave] Already on the way, Sheriff. (ominous music cont.) (sirens wailing) (fire crackling) Keep your eyes open, men. I don't want anything coming out of that barn, alive or dead. (fire crackling) (ominous synth music) (zombies growling) (zombies groaning, growling) (fire crackling) (sirens wailing) (doors open and shut) (fire crackling) Let the barn burn to the ground, chief. Just keep the fire contained. (wood crashing) (fire crackling) (fire crackling) (ominous synth music) (engine humming) (birds chirping) (dogs barking in distance) (car door slams) (gravel rustling) (ominous synth music) (metal clangs) Jesus. (intense music) (ground rustling) (metal bangs) (intense music) (gasping) (intense music) (banging metal) (suspenseful synth music) (banging metal) Jesus Christ!
