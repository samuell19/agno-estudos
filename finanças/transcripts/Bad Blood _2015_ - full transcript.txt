Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Marcus. I have to say, whatever you've been doing at home has certainly had a stabilizing effect on your immune system. Frankly, it's got several of us puzzled. But based on the results of your latest biopsy, I'm afraid to say the counts aren't very good. It's never been this advanced. What about my application for another transplant? As we discussed, the risk of infection and internal bleeding are too great. I'm sorry. What am I gonna tell my wife? I took the Orchard Road to Dr. Goodman's this morning. I just wanted to put something beautiful in my head before I got there. The treatments didn't work. There isn't much time. Lauren? Lauren! Morning, Miss Theimer. Your mail keeps coming to the house. Please, the guesthouse is unit B. Sorry. And all this motorcycle business is giving Mitsy fits. Yeah. Ohh. I'll keep it down. I promise. Sorry. "The guesthouse is B." No, you're the B. Sorry, Deb finally got her shamrock on the drunk wall and I just got her home. Sounds like I shouldn't have left so early. Hey, will you give me a hand with this? Trust me, bigger mistakes were made, ones involving, ow, Jagerbombs and a trucker named the Human Tripod. Gross. Well, Mike's not in so you can detox on his couch, if you want. Nope, I am going to punish myself with paperwork. Well, this is a surprise, Sheriff. Actually, I'm looking for Mike. Oh, Mike's not in. There's a rattle in the thing whenever I make a left. Thought I'd have him take a look at it. Right. A rattle- in-the-thing problem. Hmm. Maybe you could take a look at it. What? You're awfully quiet. What's going on in that head of yours? Don't guys usually fall asleep in this part? Most guys. Don't most girls like this sort of thing? Most girls. I think this one looks new. You sure there's not a little Lauren I should know about? Yeah. Actually, I've been hiding her in the closet for the past six months. Actually, his name is Martin. Should I be jealous? He's eight. Or 10 now. Guess you can call him my pen pal. See? You're already learning more about me. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Miss Theimer threatened to kick me out again. I don't blame her. You are very loud. You know, you have a gun. You could get rid of her for good. I think I might have a better solution. Oh, you mean that bachelor pad above Benny's? I think I'll take my chances with the Wicked Witch. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. It doesn't have to be there. We can get a place in town. Church, I've barely been here a year. You know I'm still getting settled in. Hmmmm. Oh, my God, you are totally bleeding. I'm meeting Church at McKieron's tonight. He says he has a surprise for me. You don't think... Wait, you totally should have told me! I could have done your hair. You can't get engaged looking like that. Come on, I'm not getting engaged. Come on, he is a good guy. A great guy. Hey, baby girl. Ah. It's cocktail hour for Mama. Here we go. Let me take that. Here we go. Mitsy, what is going on with you? Hm, I got your treats. Mits? Mits? 911. What's your emergency? I think someone is in my house. Ma'am, would you like me to dispatch your call? Ma'am, are you okay? Oh! Oh, I'm fine. I'm sorry. That was just my dog. I'm sorry. Lauren! Lauren! Sheriff. Diaz. Any word from Lauren? She'll turn up. She probably crashed with Frances. Heard things got crazy at the Boot last night. Mm-hmm. So, looks like entry into the main house from the back. Sheriff... Can I help you? Forensics. State sent me down to give you a hand. You their roadie? That's funny. Damn, I was just trying to make conversation. She's cute. What do you think? Could you stand back, please? There's a dog. Has anyone seen the dog? Stop petting the dog. What? Stop petting him. Take it easy, it's just a dog. And I'm pretty sure he's a she. 911. What's your emergency? I think someone is in my house. Diaz. Okay. Where have you been all night? Out riding. Trying to clear my head. Does Church know where you are? You haven't even slept, okay? You can crash at my place. You seriously just... Frances. Please. Babe, I just came to say goodbye. Where are you gonna go? Lauren! Lauren! Are you sure you want to do this? Rich, look, I'm sorry I haven't called back. I just... Lauren, I wouldn't say anything else. Lauren Malone, you're under arrest for the murder of Tess Theimer. You have the right to remain silent... You have the right to an attorney... What the hell is going on? Please have a seat. Your counsel's on his way up from Broward, so he might be here in an hour or two. You don't have to say anything until then. I have nothing to hide. Okay. Let's start with where you've been since last night. Church. It's Sheriff Church. Okay, well, as I was telling Deputy Diaz, I was out riding. I needed some time to think. Alone? Yes, of course, I was alone. How did you cut your hand? Building a bike. Before or after Friday night? Let's talk about Garfield Juvenile Corrections. I was 16 and that's not supposed to be on my record. It's not. But you might remember a cotton swab they ran inside your cheek, standard check-in procedure. Why would I remember that? Your blood was found all over Tess's house, Lauren. That's... it's not possible. Can you give me a minute? Church, please, it's me. Yeah. Who is that, exactly? You lied to me about your name, Lauren Baker? I took my mother's. And what about your father? You told me you didn't know him. May as well be true. Let's see here. Four counts of grand theft auto, one aggravated assault, one manslaughter. Nine years up in State. That's him, not me. Felony arrest 2004. Unlisted accomplice, a minor. That was one car. One car, one teenage mistake. And I never asked for a laundry list of yours. No, you didn't. You never asked me anything. But now I know why. Do you really think that I could do this? They found your blood. Then somebody put it there. You tell me how that happened. I don't know. Tess called 911. There's a tape, Lauren, and she clearly says your name. Church, please. Your counsel will be here in two hours. Church! Bail was denied in the case of Lauren Baker at Logan County Courthouse this morning. The state made its case with what it calls "overwhelming DNA evidence." And while investigators uncover the so-called Lady Killer's record of criminal behavior, she will have to await trial at county corrections for her day in court. Ah! No! No! No, please! No! No! No! No! Who are you? I'm the one who saved you. You're free. They're gonna come looking for me. I mean, that's insane. How could they ever think that you'd do something like this? How do you know I didn't? You set me up. You killed her. No.Yes. I saved you. Just like you saved me. I've been waiting so long. No! Please help me! No, no! No! Show some gratitude. You were on your way to death row. I set you free! Please... Please, please. Shh, shh. Please. 12-gauge? Yeah. Where's her body? Looks like he took it with him. What about the tires? Law enforcement spike strip of some sort. Buried it under the road surface over there. Suspect's vehicle was parked there. Probably set up some sort of barricade. Somebody really wanted to spring this girl. Blood relative maybe. You reckon? Get a couple of cars out to Ray Baker's place. Last report had him in Maynard County. I bet they'll find he left in a hurry. Will do, Sheriff. Lauren's father? Yeah. He's got a record a mile long, and this smells like family business to me. Thank you for the observations, uh...? Bates. Like the motel. Thank you. You knew her, right? How's that? Lauren? Heard you two were engaged. Let's get something straight here. Your role in this investigation is to provide forensic analysis. You are not a criminologist. You are not an investigator. Am I wrong? No, Sheriff. Okay. And, no, I didn't know her. Not really. The state line manhunt has expanded for murder suspect Lauren Baker and police now believe her accomplice to be her father Raymond Baker of Maynard County. Photos of both suspects are being released... Okay, okay. Lauren. Noooo! Aghhh! Aghhh! You're still here. Am I still a suspect? Miss Theimer calls me one more time, I'm gonna have to arrest you. What's this mean? It's my mom's name. She died when I was little. I'm sorry. What are these? Battle wounds. Well, I know not to mess with you. Don't worry, I'm not so tough. I don't know about that. I mean, the bikes and the engines... Your dad a fan of that type of work? I never knew him. You goin' home? Oh, in a bit. Any news on Ray Baker? We turned over his place. Nothing to suggest where he might have gone. APBs out? Media have the new photos? Statewide. You should get some sleep, boss. Yeah. Gonna drink me to death? Why pick a fight I know I can't win? I don't figure you came here looking for me. Thought the old place might be a good spot to crash in? I figured no one's been dumb enough to run cars through here for a while. I guess I miscalculated. From what I seen on TV, you done a lot of miscalculating lately. I didn't do it. I know. How did you know I'd end up here? I just guessed. Come on. Nothing like the leg you broke in Durham. It was my arm, and it was in Beloit. You sucked it up. You were always a tough kid. Maybe that's how Mom sold it to you when you finally decided to turn up. You said he'd been waiting a long time to meet you. What does that mean? I don't know. You have a kid? How the hell's that any of your business? He had to get your blood from somewhere. Have you been in a hospital? No. I don't have a kid. It doesn't matter either way. I just need to disappear for a while. I'm thinking Mexico. Oh, so that's it? You're just gonna cut and run? Well, I can't go to the cops. You're a fighter like your mother. And look where that got her. Hey, it got her another good six months. Don't you take that for granted. How the hell would you know? You weren't there. And, by the way, this isn't cancer. No, this is something you can actually see and fight. I have no idea who this guy is. Well, if you're not gonna find him, I will. I don't want your help. Last time I signed up for one of your schemes, I ended up in juvy for six months. I got nine years. I'll be working out back. Stick to what you're good at. No, sir, I can't take any more orders. Well, quite frankly, 'cause she is a fugitive so I'm guessing she has more on her mind than fixing your bike. Please tell me you're not here for a custom order. No. It's my car. Is that her work? Lauren? Are you and Lauren close? Look, I'm busy. Maybe you should come back when Mike's here. Judging by the footprints, there were two additional people in the room. Don't let any of the reporters near here. Yes, sir. Sheriff. I've looked at Lauren Baker's file. Double homicide is a big leap from grand theft auto. People are full of surprises. You read her old man's record. Explain the two others in the room. The victim shows no signs of bruising on her wrists. There was someone else in the chair. That's all theoretical. What I know for a fact is Lauren Baker escaped with help from an accomplice and her father, a convicted felon, is on the run. What if she didn't escape? Where are you going with this? I pulled blood samples from the broken glass of prison transport. They belong to Lauren. So? Under your theory, that would have been her father's blood. Ray Baker's DNA is in our system and I found no trace of him at the crime scene. Maybe she busted the window and she cut herself climbing out. Or, maybe, she was taken against her will from the cruiser. You ever see anything like that, Sheriff? We're talking about a very disturbed pathology. Sheriff! They just found Lauren's prison jumper out by Route 14. Call me when you have evidence and not just theories. Talk to Frances again. Take her to the station this time. Scare her a little bit. Yes, sir. Wow. You look like trouble on a stick. Yeah, well, you're the one with the drag kit. I had my friend Crystal drop a few things by. She's a dancer. Oh yeah? I wouldn't have guessed. Have some breakfast. It's not mine. I'm not one to judge. He dropped it in the cabin. This looks like something they gave your mother... I think, after they stopped her chemo. You want to take a field trip? Your mother used to go to that cancer clinic up in Jessup. It's the only decent one in this half of the state. We only have a pill. It's not a lot to go on. You know what he looks like. Just have to get his file. Once we get his address, I'll take care of the rest. Whose is this? They're gonna be looking for my truck. Borrowed it from a friend. You don't have any friends. I knew it. ...We're not stealing this car. What the hell are you worried about? You're already wanted for murder. Go to hell, Ray. We're running just a little low on options, wouldn't you say? Come on. Pop the hood. Hit it. When I was first diagnosed, we found temporary remedies. My wife was actually the first one to suggest it. She gave and gave, but... she's gone now. And now that I'm facing death... I can finally be alive. You're gonna bring her to me. You remember that road trip we took in my old Cadillac? Out to your uncle's place. I'm not here for a family reunion. A man can only apologize so many times. I never wanted an apology. I wanted a father. I made a lot of mistakes. I never should have involved you back then. You know the sickest part? I wanted to steal that car with you. The only time you ever paid me any attention. And the second you had a chance to save your own ass, you bailed. New developments in the cop killer case from Logan County today. While murder suspect Lauren Baker and her father Raymond remain at large, authorities are now reporting the disappearance of Baker's friend and co-worker Miss Frances O'Connor, who police suspect could be aiding them. Who is it? My best friend. He must have come back for her. All the more reason to find him. And then what? Maybe you should just turn me in. I could try talking to Church again. You think all of a sudden they're gonna listen to you? One thing I know about cops, they're not real big on negotiation. We better find this guy and bring him in... one way or the other. Sheriff? It's Bates. She says you're not picking up your phone. Yeah, there's a reason for that. She says she's found another victim. Go. I read about a body a few days ago... Nicole Thatcher, found way up north in Wellington. The case was above my pay grade, but state CID thought the profile matched another five dead girls, missing persons going back years. Bodies buried all over the state. And? And all of the victims have needle marks on their arms. Okay, so drugs? I don't think so. I went back and checked and I... Sheriff, I think it's very possible that Lauren Baker was abducted by the actual killer. I really don't want you to waste your time. This is a form of oral chemotherapy. Several brands on the market. It's prescribed to many of our patients. But, again, there's not much else I can tell you. As I made clear, we have a very stringent privacy policy here. Okay, I understand your policy, I do. But it is very important that I find him. That's really all I can tell you. I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me. Um... Where did you get this? As I said before, we do not divulge patient information. I was a bone marrow donor five years ago. This was the recipient... Martin. It's him, isn't it? He's Martin. I'm sorry, I can't... Tell me who made this. All right, that's it. You need to leave right now. You want to tell me what's going on? Bone marrow? He's been sending 'em to me for years. I had his address the whole time. Where is it? Oh, great. So your plan is to return to the crime scene and pray we don't get caught? You got your daddy's poor judgment. All units, Jessup County Medical reporting a possible 21 fax. Possible sighting of suspects matching the description of Lauren Baker and Raymond Baker inside Jessup County Medical Center. That address is 1225... Why don't you let me do this? 'Cause it's my house. Just try and watch out for me this time. Come on, come on, come on. Hello? Is anybody in the house? Hey! Take the keys out of the ignition. Put your hands where I can see 'em. Step out of the vehicle. Raymond Baker, get down on your knees. Put your hands on your head. Put your hands on your head. Where is she, huh? Where's Lauren? Get in the back. If you didn't stop that squad car, then how'd you find her? She found me, I told you. Where's she at, Ray? You got her tied up somewhere? If you're not gonna listen to me... You killed this deputy! You pulled Lauren out of the car. Now where did you take her? Is there anyone smarter than you here? Come on, send me someone to talk to! Hey. Now you listen to me. Lauren told me she didn't even have a father. She told me you were dead. Now, there's nobody else coming for you, so you had better start working with me and you tell me where she is. Now! I really need to make a statement. I don't have a whole lot of time. Thank you. Is someone coming right away? Can I help you? Oh, yeah, I was trying to tell that deputy I was accosted at the hospital today. I can take your statement. No one has the right to know the identities of donors. The system is encrypted for a reason. That's why I missed it the first time. Lauren was a bone marrow match for Oscar Marcus five years ago. Your patient... he's got her DNA, doesn't he? Thank you, Ray. I've been treating him for 10 years. A recipient's immune system is completely destroyed before a transplant. Once the patient gets that marrow donation, it creates new, healthy blood that would match the donor's. It's called a chimera, when a person has two kinds of DNA. His hair and tissue will always be the same, but his blood will effectively be Lauren's. The chances of a bone marrow match are 1 in 20,000. Genetically speaking, she's his soul mate. And these? I assumed his kid made them. Sheriff! Surveillance cameras at that hospital clinic in Jessup confirmed both Lauren and Ray Baker were back there. Also, the ID of the car she was driving... someone just called it in, parked on the side of the road upstate. Who lives there? An Oscar Marcus. Okay, Ray, tell me again what you were doing at the clinic. Finally ready to listen? Let's go. You can tell me in the car. Where the hell is Bates? Come on, come on. Wake up. Okay. Okay, all right. Come on. Come on, it's me. Wake up. Shh. I know. I know. All right? This should be much easier the second time around. I'm gonna make two incisions on either side of your spine. And then... I'll use a hollow needle... to remove the liquid marrow. Okay. We've both been waiting a long time. You and I... are finally gonna be together. No one... will be able to break us apart. Put it down. Okay. I knew it wasn't you. I'm sorry. Put it down. Watch him. Turn around. Fill it. What? Fill it! I already have your blood. You don't need mine. I'm here to take it back. You want to watch me bleed, don't you? That's why we were matched. Because inside, we're the same. You're right. I do want to see you bleed. Daddy? Go back to the house, Martin. Martin, go back to the house. You know you're not allowed out here. You son of a... Martin... are you the one that drew all those pretty pictures? Okay, well, I want you to go back to the house and make me something pretty. Can you do that for me? Do what your mother says! You truly are my angel. Stay with Bates. It's okay... I'm not gonna say, "I told you so." Yes, ma'am. Frances. Hi, baby. Are you okay? It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, okay? Hey. You didn't deserve this, okay? Thank you. Okay. You came back. You mind if maybe I stick around this time? Good afternoon, ma'am. Slow day? Should you be stopping law-abiding women on the road? Just want to make sure you stay on the far shoulder. You know, keep safe. Yeah, well, I'm pretty good at taking care of myself. Thank you. Let's just call it a clean slate. I'm ready to talk whenever you are. I'll keep you posted.
