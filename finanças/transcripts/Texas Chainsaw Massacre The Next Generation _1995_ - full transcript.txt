...has hinted that it could be only the beginning. Hi, honey, you're home! In a seemingly related story, a Lebanese citizen... Starting to worry. I wondered where you were. Get off my back. Hear me? I just wondered if you had a good day. Please, get off my back! Stop screaming! Fuckin' shut up! Fine. Charlotte! A Miami jury today returned a guilty verdict in the slaying of abortion doctor Irwin Guffer. It took the seven-man, five-woman jury only a matter of hours to find... Mother! Get out of my room. What are you afraid of, huh? All I'm askin' ya is to be a nice girl. No big deal, huh? Even if you weren't a slimeball, aren't you forgetting that you're married to my mother? You shut your damn mouth. - I think you want it. - Mother! Who the fuck do you think she's gonna believe anyway, huh? - Jenny? - Shit, either way, you fuckin' lose, bitch. Jenny? Jenny. One damn word outta your mouth, so help me God I'll divorce the bitch. It's what you want, honey bunny. Have at it. Jenny? Huh? If you know what's good for you, keep your pretty damn mouth shut. Jenny. No, Mom, it's okay. Never mind. You sure? Yeah. Shit, what do you need, a sworn affidavit? God. No, I just thought-- Don't think. You're too damn stupid to think. Jack. Oh, that must be Sean. Hey, answer the goddamn door. Hey! God! Hey, Charles, I think you're chasing the wrong tail there, buddy. Oh, my God! Where have you been? We've been waiting. The wedding's going on inside. We need to put you on the top tier. Don't mind the footprints in the icing. I'm excited. They look good. It's like a vest thing. I fucking hate kids. Miss Abbott, did Barry come through here? Barry? Oh, Barry. - Didn't you break up? - No! Oh, well, never mind. I just thought... Forget it. She's doing it again. Miss Abbott, she just does that to make trouble, okay? It is obvious. It is so... - What are you talking about? - Obvious. Don't even listen to a word she says. She's just trying to make trouble. All that... All that... All that... All that... It's just that she's such a bitch! - Sean, hi. - Hey. Have you seen Barry? - Not in a while. Have you? - No. She was, like, completely naked. Oh, bullshit. No, she was spit on all over the place. It was like a battleship or something, you know? So I lay her down... - A battleship? - Okay, like a dinghy. Has anybody seen Barry? Have you seen Barry? - Barry! - Oh, shit! Heather! Shit! Don't worry about it, Barry. She'll be back. If that's really what you want. Heather! Heather! Heather, stop! Heather! Stop the car! Heather! Damn it, Heather! Heather, you better fuckin' stop this car right fuckin' now! Damn it, if we have a wreck, it's gonna be my ass! I don't care. Slow down, please. I wasn't doing anything. I don't know what you're so pissed off about. Barry, I saw you. You were kissing her. Once. I kissed her once. What's wrong with that? Come on, it's like I can't even talk to my friends anymore. I can't believe how possessive you are. Oh, right. I guess that's why you were feeling her up. I wonder why. What am I supposed to do, jerk off the rest of my life? It's not my fault if you're frigid. I am not! Look, guys need sex, okay? It's bad for you to get all worked up and then not get it. You can get "prostrate" cancer. Is that what you want? That's a lie. Heather, look out! Heather! Fuck! What the fuck is the matter with you? My father's gonna kill me. Thank you very fucking much! Shit. I'm dead. I'm so fuckin' dead right now. Oh, man. You can't get cancer from not having sex. Oh, right. Like you'd know. You never had a date in your life, you're so ugly. - She is not. - Shut up, Sean. He's just trying to make you think it's your fault. Look, my father's a doctor, okay? I think I know what I'm talking about, so fuck you, Jenny. It's true. It is my fault. I won't have sex with him. That doesn't make it your fault. Yeah, but what if he gets cancer and all his hair falls out from all the drugs or something? It could happen. Yeah, Jenny, so just shut up, all right? No, that's just a line to get you to have sex with him. - Ask Sean. - She's right. He's never had a hard-on in his life. I know all his lines. He lived across the street from me till the eighth grade. Shut up, Sean. We were even friends before he got too cool, so fucking annoying. Hey, it's not my fault you turned out to be such a little geek. He used to come over to my house all the time and he'd be laughing about all the girls he'd felt up. His big line was to tell 'em that his father was a doctor... and that they could get breast cancer if they didn't get felt up enough. - Barry! - Okay, I lied. Big deal. It's not my fault they're stupid enough to believe it. - What a schmuck. - What's your problem, Jenny? Just 'cause you hate guys. He's just tryin' to change the subject. What are you afraid of? That they might try to fuck you? No. It's not like it's a big secret. - What? - Ask anybody. You never go to parties. You never go anywhere unless you're with Sean. Everybody knows that he's a little pothead and all you are is friends. By the way, I know what you're doin' in my car. You're gettin' stoned. If my dad smells this shit tomorrow, I'm gonna kick your ass. Wait, wait, wait. I just thought of something so cool. What if we got into a wreck and we crashed into a car in front of us and we all died? They could write a song about it. Shut up. - Where the hell are we? - Oh, great. We're lost. No, we're not. All we have to do is go back. Look for a place where we could turn around. Cool dress, Jenny. What's this? Stop. What's the matter? Afraid somebody might find out you have tits? Barry! - Girls have tits. - Leave her alone, Barry. There's no place to turn around. There's never any place to turn around. This sucks. These assholes don't know how to make roads. What was that? Did you all see that? Watch out! Oh, no. I'm so dead. - Is he okay? - I don't know. God! This is gonna leave a scar. I'm not hurt. I'm not hurt. - Oh, shit. - His head. Oh, my God! Is he dead? Did he die? No, he's just passed out. You can tell by his eyes. Yeah, but he could be in shock. We need to get him to a doctor. Yeah, right. And keep him warm. - All right. - How did you know that? Something bad's gonna happen. I can feel it. He's gonna die. Look at him. Do you think it'll start? I'm dead. Somebody kill me, please. It's my fault. If he dies, I'll be a murderer. We've gotta find someplace where we can call an ambulance. - I'll go. - Okay, come on. I'm not stayin' here alone. What if he dies? Fine, then I'll go with you. You stay away from me. This is stupid. Look, I'm gonna go, and whoever wants to come, come. - But somebody needs to stay. - I don't know what to do. Wait. Do you have a flashlight? Is somebody gonna come with me? - Stop! I heard something. - Heather. I had these dreams about some weirdo following me through the woods, - and it's coming true. - Yeah? I'm sorry, but we're all gonna die. Mm-hmm. Some murderer, like that guy in Chicago. He killed people and put their hearts in a refrigerator. He's gonna kill us. They're gonna show our pictures, naked... with our hearts torn out on A Current Affair. God. What was that? Great. Now we can't see jack. I'm sorry, but someone is following me. I can feel their eyes on my back. - Bullshit. - No, that's what they want. For us to go wandering around in the dark. We need to stay here and start a fire. We need to call an ambulance. We can't do anything until we can see. Ew, what is it? Thank God. We're saved. Somebody say a prayer. Piece of shit. You might be, but my father is still gonna kill me. Call the police. There's been this horrible accident. A man's dying. Prom night. Somebody bring me a glass of water, please. Quick. I'm think I'm gonna pass out. Goddamn answering machine. Don't you worry. He'll pick up. Vilmer, if you're there, babe, pick up the phone. Vilmer. Phony as three-dollar bills. Changed my life, though. Goddamn it, Vilmer, button it up, babe. - Get me some water? - Stop it. You know what? The minute I showed up with these... every peanut farmer in the county thought he was God's gift to women. What the hell. - Doubled my commissions... - Okay. in the first six months. Goddamn it. It's about time. Vilmer, listen. Some kids got in a wreck up the road, and one of 'em's hurt. Uh-huh. W-w-wait-wait a second, wait a second. - Which way? - Back that way. - How far? - About a mile. About a mile back up 709 from me. Uh-huh. All right. Bye. Why do blondes stick their heads out of car windows? - Why? - Get a refill. I don't get it. Airheads? We should get back then and see if Sean's okay. Yeah. - What the hell was that? - Don't worry about it. Just some farmer's wife. Like I'm even interested. See 'em and weep! Or some high school boy. You know, they are always doin' somethin' to get me to flash 'em. - Worse. - What? Hey! Hey, is there an ambulance coming? This guy's hurt. I think he's delirious. Is he okay? Boy's dead. No, he's not. He's just passed out. I said he's dead. But he was just talkin', like talkin' in his sleep. Is that right? Well... He's dead now. Boy, don't even think about running off down that road. It ain't gonna do you a damn bit of good, I can tell you that right now. What are you gonna do? Well, first, I'm gonna kill ya. It ain't no fuckin' biggie. 'Course, it's different for every individual. You tired yet, boy? Please, mister, you're scaring me. No shit. What did I do? Let's just say you're shit out of luck, son. Just tell me what I can do. Give me a chance. Oh, we ain't even havin' fun yet, son. Run, run, run! Swing right. Come back to Papa. Now. All right, racing fans. Here... We... Go! Oh! Oh! ♪ This is what I want ♪ Oh, still kickin'! That should have done it. Yes, that should have done it. Sorry I can't give you all a ride. That wrecker'll be along before you know it. - Thanks for calling for us. - Yeah, thanks. Oh, hey! Don't you worry about that old boy that drives the wrecker. He talks tough, but you just tell him how the cows eat the cabbage... and you won't have any trouble. Okay. Thanks a lot. Hey, what about the service station across the road? You think maybe somebody there could give us a ride? That old man? Oh, he is liable to shoot first and ask questions later. Hey! We see you, you old fart. Thanks. Bye. Barry, there's somebody out there. I mean it this time. I'm not making it up. Stop. Listen. I don't hear anything. Jenny, stop! My feet hurt. What am I supposed to do, carry you? Carry me piggyback. Just for awhile. Lose 20 pounds. Yeah. Oh. Oh, man. All right. This guy's a lifesaver. Hey! Hey, hey. Come on, man. Wait. Hey, man, wanna give us a ride? All we need is a ride. We'll pay you. Jenny! Barry, wait! We could get arrested for trespassing. No. Heather! Barry! Please, come on. Hey, if you guys can hear me, I'm gonna go back and see if Sean's okay. All right? All right? No, wait! Hey! Okay, who's there? Is there anybody there? Barry, wait. Stop. What if they're murderers and they want us to follow them... so they can hide behind trees and stab us? There could be dead people buried all around us, and we'd never know. They could tie us up in a cellar and no one would ever hear us. That's dumb. There aren't any cellars in the houses around here. Okay, that's it. Don't call me dumb, Barry. I may not be the smartest person in the world, but I'm not stupid. I just act that way sometimes to get people to like me, that's all. Yeah, right. All those stories about murderers and people following me. I know it's not true. It's better than being bored. I'll tell you what's stupid... is that line you gave me about you and that girl, Brenda. Not even a little kid would believe that. Jenny, that bitch. She started this whole thing. It's all her fault. You'd like to think. I'll tell you what it is. I'm a bitch. I'm just like my mother. She can't stand my father. But she stays with him because she wants a certain kind of life. I don't care what anybody thinks. That's still the best way to get it. What's wrong with that? Forget it. Okay, fine, but you should've said something. It pisses me off that you let me go on like this. It's embarrassing. I told you, I'm a bitch. If I wasn't such a chicken, I'd be more like Jenny. No, you wouldn't. - You're probably right. - She's a dog. - Oh, huh? You just don't know. - What? Everyone thinks she's such a wuss, right? Right. Her mother gets married every 15 minutes, and her husbands are always hitting on her. That's why she's the way she is, but I've had P.E. with her. - She's got a body to die for. - Really? Sean? Sean? Great. Tell them we'll give 'em 50 bucks if they give us a ride, okay? Fifty bucks? You don't have to give it to them. Tell them to send us a bill. If they get mad, give 'em five bucks. Tell 'em we'll send the rest later. It's no big deal. Just business. My father does it all the time. You are weird. Hey, is anybody home? Hello? Must be deaf. Hey, is anybody in there? Maybe they're out back. Well, go check. Hey, I have an idea! Why don't I go check? Bitch. Ow! Damn it! Hold it right there. It's okay. We had a wreck. All we want is a ride. You better not shoot me, mister. There was a man that shot a kid who was robbing his house, and they got him for murder. "I propose to fight it out on this line "if it takes all summer." That's Ulysses S. Grant. You probably didn't know that, did you? 'Course you didn't. 'Cause you're a bona fide moron. Come pokin' your nose around here where it don't belong. Heather! It's okay. She's my girlfriend. Don't trouble yourself. Barry! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! Please! No. No! Please! Please! No! Please! Please! Hey, if I go in there, that's kidnapping. My father's a lawyer. I know what I'm talkin' about, okay? "Among other evils that being unarmed brings you... "it causes you to be despised." That's Niccolo Machiavelli. Now get! Okay, okay. I need to use your bathroom, anyway. Dumb-ass! Heather? Where's the phone? I'm calling the cops. Boy, you are as dull as ditchwater. Yeah, right. Heather, you in here? Heather? Heather? I need to piss. Where the hell's the bathroom? Heather? Heather, you okay? There's some crazy guy outside with a shotgun. Locked him out, though. You should've seen me. Fuck! Heather? What's goin' on in there? Barry? Who's out there? Please! No! No! No! No! No! You don't need to be walkin' these roads alone this time of night. Why don't you get in? Are you the one that moved the cars? Listen, either you want a ride or you don't. It's up to you. Where are you goin'? Where's Sean? - Where do you wanna go? - Where's Sean? - Is that your boyfriend? - Yeah. He was the one that wasn't hurt. Do you know where he is? I know exactly where he is. Now why don't you get in? Well, where is he? Goddamn it! I said get in the truck. Well, wait a second. Hang on. Yeah. You gotta watch gettin' into cars with strangers these days. I heard about an old man once, picked up a little girl on the side of the road... chopped both her arms off, stuffed her in a culvert, left her for dead. - God, I fuckin' hate that. - Yeah. I mean, that sorry son of a bitch didn't have shit for an imagination. How fuckin' simple can you get? - Stop. You're scarin' me. - Scarin' you? You're not scared. You don't know shit about bein' scared, little girl. Not yet. You want scared? You want scared? Have a look behind you. Have a look. Yeah, how about that, huh? - Look again, goddamn it! - No! Go ahead, look again! No! I think I want you to stop and let me out. You think? Or do you know? Huh? Go ahead and have a look. - Getcha a better look. - No. - You don't wanna look? - No. No. What's your goddamn problem? Okay. If you stop, I'll look. - You wanted to stop. - Stop it! Ow! Ow! Come on, have a look at that. Have a look at that. Take a look at that. How 'bout that? What is that? What is that? Huh? Huh? Oh, God! Yeah, of course, you gotta throw in a little somethin' extra... just to let 'em know it ain't Saturday mornin' cartoons, if you know what I mean. What's gonna happen to me? You think I give a goddamn what happens to you? Are you letting me go? You figure it out. It's your goddamn life. I don't understand. Well, welcome to the real world. You don't know what the hell you're doin'. Just where do you think you're goin'? Okay. If that's what you want... it's up to you. Live and learn. Oh! Oh, shit, no! No! No! God, no! Somebody! Oh, God. Open this door! - What in the world? - Oh, God. - It's okay. It's okay. - He's out there. No, no, it's fine. It's all right. Just-- just come here. Come here. Just sit down. Sit down, right now. I'm gonna go see what's what. No. It's gonna be all right. Now just sit there. I'll be fine. Now, listen. I'm just gonna go put a little scare into 'em. All right, you got any balls, show your face. It's been a long night, boys. I could use a little action. It's nothin'. No, he's out there with a chainsaw. No, he had a chainsaw. He was chasing me with a chainsaw. Listen here. It's just local boys tryin' to give you a little scare, that's all. No, the guy with the wrecker killed Sean. Hell's bells. It's party time. What about your friends? I don't know. They tried to get a ride. W.E., what the hell is goin' on? Where's Vilmer? Hey, I don't wanna hear it. You get your butt over here mucho-quicko. All right. I tell ya, that old man, his nerves are shot. Now listen. Don't you worry. Vilmer does something, it's for a good reason. - Who's Vilmer? - Good question. Hey, you know what? You look real pretty with your glasses off. - What? - Well, what... You should've brought a gunnysack or somethin'. What's this look like to you? Green eggs? Well, what the hell you waitin' for? Tie her up! Hey! You sit right down here, little lady. I got enough trouble-- Goddamn it, W.E., now look what you got started. Wait till Vilmer hears about this. I swear to God. Go! Where's my gun? It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end. Be sure to tell Vilmer I'm gonna stop off at the pizza place and pick us up some dinner, all right? Why are you doing this? "Conversation is a game of circles." That's Ralph Waldo Emerson. What if I was to turn you loose, huh? What would you give me, huh? What do you think about that, huh? What do you want? - What do you want? - I'll tell you what I want. W.E., what the hell are you doin' back there? I tell you what. Grow up, will you? And tell Vilmer I called our order in so it would be ready when I got there... and then I'm comin' straight home. Okay, we got one medium deluxe... one medium pepperoni, one large vegetarian. And your drinks'll be out in a minute. - Okay. - Help me! - Uh, lady? - Uh-huh. I think you got something in your trunk. That's just somebody I got tied up back there. - Really? - Uh-huh. Really, what's back there? You wanna come see? Sure. I-- I better not. I might get in trouble or something. All right. Will you shut up and quit kickin' my car. Okay, but I can't breathe. Welcome to Bud's. Can I get your order, please? Uh, what do you want? Coffee? Black coffee? Yeah. - Uh, two black coffees. - Is that all? If I poke a hole for you, you gonna quit? Uh-huh. - Well, somebody's gotta do it. - In your dreams. Now if I hear any more kickin' or screamin'... I'm gonna come back here and tape your mouth shut, all right? - Okay. - Okay. What you got in the car, honey? Believe me, you don't wanna know. Oh, come on now, I'm a nice guy. Uh-uh-uh... Ma'am. Your drinks are ready. What are you doin' out here in the middle of the road? Please, help me. All right. But I gotta run and go get a blanket or something first. You stay right there. Please, don't hit me. Don't! Don't hit me. Stop! Okay. But don't you go crawlin' off. Get! I said, get on out there. Move! Leave him alone. You run along and do whatever W.E. tells you. He even tries to hit you, you let me know... and I'll tell Vilmer. "I have not yet begun to fight." That's John Paul Jones. You might can scare him, but you so much as lay a finger on me... you'll wish you'd never been born. Oh, hey, almost forgot. One of 'em got away. She's crawlin' off down the road. You better get her, too. Come on. Bring her in. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. See? I'm not gonna hurt you. See? I'm right here. Not gonna hurt you. Go on. Get in there. Move! Get! Get! Hi, sweetie. How was your day? Sweetie, would you shut up? What are you so pissed off about? Huh? You having a bad day, huh? Why are my batteries not charged? Did W.E. tell you? That son of a bitch. I tell you what. I told him to let you know that I was on my way for pizzas on the way home, and he didn't tell you, and I'm sick of it. Look what your brother did to this door. Nobody gives a damn about that door. Hey, mister, I have had it with you. I'm so sick and tired of you tryin' to stir up trouble between me and Vilmer. You're the one causin' problems. Ever since you got here, you been nothin' but trouble. Nobody gives a goddamn about the door. I'm the one who puts things together here. - Nobody cares. - It was fine before you come. I said shut up. My God. What are you gonna do? You don't fuckin' believe this, do you? Oh, God. What are you gonna do to me? You know, I asked you a goddamn question. He asked you a goddamn... You don't think the FBI has this place under 24-hour surveillance? You don't think there's transmitters in all these walls? Let me ask you one question. - Are you havin' fun yet? - Oh, God! Because I promise you... I promise you, you and I are gonna have some fun. Oh, no. No more, please. - No. Ow. - What's my fuckin' name? - What is this? What is this? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! You don't know? - You don't know shit, do you? - No. No. Do you think all I want to do is kill you? I don't know. You're goddamn right you don't. Hey, why don't you just try to relax a bit, honey. I know it's hard. Why don't you mind your fuckin' business? Look at this fucking door. What? "The woman's a whore, "and there's an end on it." That's Samuel Johnson. Oh, take it on out of here. Now, now. Don't you let him get to you, 'cause that's what he wants. Will you please tell me what all this is for? Well, you'll have to ask Vilmer that. But if you ask me, I think the son of a bitch is from outer space. Oh, God. What are you gonna do? No, what are you gonna do? - Don't hurt her. - Give her a kiss. How could I hurt a pretty face like this, huh? But then, I am in the mood for love. There, now. How's that? Feel better? Look at you. You're really pretty. You know what? I have got this dress that I have never even worn and it would be perfect on you. Oh, you're scared. - I just don't want to die. - Well, of course you don't. Will you help me? Shut up in there. Hey, you just hush up yourself. It's just girl talk. I tell you what. He's not near as bad as he seems, once you get to know him. It's just this job. You know, all the stress. It's his job to kill people? Well, I really shouldn't be telling you this. But you know how you always hear these stories about these people who run everything, but nobody knows who they are, right? Well, it's true. I mean, I never would have believed it, but it's all true. I mean, who do you think killed Kennedy? Government? No, that government stuff is bullcrap. It's these people. And they've been doing this kind of thing for, like, a thousand, or two thousand years, I forget which. And nobody, I mean nobody, knows their names. And that's who Vilmer works for. Oh, that-- that's-- that's really interesting. What did you say your name was? Darla. I've always hated that name. Uh, I'm Jenny. Well, I'll tell you, miss Jenny, it is a pleasure to meet you. Is there maybe something that I should know? That I could do? Well... with Vilmer, I guess, it's always a good idea to... keep your mouth shut, do what he tells you, oh. Don't make him mad. I told you-- goddamn it! Vilmer. Vilmer, let me in! Alone again, huh? Vilmer, you better not be messing with her. Little desert flower. I've got a mind... to slit your goddamn throat. Give you a count to ten to give me a reason why I shouldn't. - Nine, eight, don't be late. - What? Oh! Seven, six, you better get it right. I don't want you to kill me. Five, four. Three, two. Yes, you want me alive for some reason! Huh? You want me alive for some reason. That's a good answer. Goddamn it, you let me in! That's a good answer. Smart girl. We've got us a smart girl. Well... it kind of makes you think, doesn't it, smart girl? Wrong, wrong. You're embarrassing me in front of company! No, no, no, no, no! Don't you ever touch me! Okay, stop! Nobody move, or I'll shoot! What did she say? "Nobody move, or I'll shoot?" You want my advice? Gut-shoot him. Poison his insides. Otherwise, it won't do no good. He's been shot before. Lots of times. Run over. It don't mean spit. Oh, shut up, W.E. Nobody asked you. You shut up! All the time, runnin' your big mouth. No, everybody shut up! Why don't you shut up? Okay, now get down on the floor. Everybody get on the floor and put your hands in front of you! - Get down! - Okay. You get down, too. What are you gonna do, shoot me? Yeah, if you try something. What if I do this? Goddamn it, Vilmer! That ain't one bit funny! Stop it! Now, we're goin'. Now, we're goin'. What do you think, huh? One, two. Take your fuckin' chances. - It's a damn trick. - Shut up, W.E. Why don't you shut up your own self? Oh, God. Just forget it, hon. I tell you, if that shotgun was anywhere where you could get at it, believe me, it's what he wanted. No. You stop. You get back down. "Discretion is the better part of valor." That'd be Billy Shakespeare. You get down too, or I'll kill you. - Come on. - Hey, I'm sorry, sweetie. I got a big mouth. What can I say? Okay, maybe it's not loaded. But maybe it is, so fuck you. And if you come near me, or if you try to stop me, I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off! Hey, let's not make this an all-nighter, all right? I mean, I hate to be a party pooper, but it's late and I'm tired and the pizzas are getting cold. And nobody asked you fuckin' shit! Heather. Heather, get up. Get up, Heather. You have to get up. We're gonna go. Five more minutes. Get up, Heather! You're gonna kill her! Heather, come on. Get up. I can't find my shoes! Heather, come on. It's okay. Get up. No, Heather. No, you got to get up. You got to get up now. We have to get out of here. Stop it! Pop goes the weasel. Oh, my God! What are you doin' in there, little girl? Hey, what are you doin' there? Whoa! Oh, God! Oh, God, ohh... It's a damn shame about her face, Leather. At least you can have her shoes. Look who's comin' to visit. Come on up and have a good time. We want to see that that doesn't happen again. No! Don't get excited. That ought to settle her down for a while. You better be nice to me. 'Cause I can always go back to my husband. Is that all you got? Huh? Huh? Better come eat before it gets cold. All right, all right, all right. What took you so long? Welcome to my world. I suppose we can forget about having a nice, quiet evening. Just go ahead and breathe into this. Go ahead. Breathe. Breathe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I told him once, I told him a thousand times, it's gonna end in tears. You lie down with dogs, you're gonna get up with fleas. Any fool ought to know that. "Common sense is not so common." That'd be Voltaire. All right. Are you gonna help me or not? Are you gonna help me or not? And don't tell me any more of your stupid stories. Hon, you just don't understand. He doesn't work for anybody. Shh. Shh. The only reason for any of this is that he's a psycho and he gets off on it. Get off. Now listen. I just can't. See, he put this little thing in my head... and all he has to do is push one little button, and, and, and... blow my head clean off. There's nothing in your head. Girl, you just said a mouthful. You get to runnin' with the wrong crowd, wind up in the reformatory. No respect. No discipline. That's the problem. Family values have gone straight to hell. Now, for why we came. My brother here is tired of what's-her-name's face... and he wants a new one. It just happens to be he wants this face right here. - Oh, no! Oh, no! No! - Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! - No! - Oh, yes! Yes, it does. Don't you touch me! Don't you ever touch me! If you're gonna kill me, then do it! I'm not gonna put up with any more of your crap. It's bullshit. Nobody believes any of it... except your idiot girlfriend! It's fucking pathetic! There is nothing to fear but fear itself. Now, I'm gonna leave... and no one is gonna stop me. You sit the fuck down! And shut up. Are we havin' a party or what? Here we go! Douse her down! Oh, please! No, you can't do that! No! - She had nothing to do with it! - That doesn't matter. - I'm sorry! - Fire in the hole! - Burn! - No! Watch her burn! Watch her burn! Burn! Burn! Now, why'd you have to do that? You know I can never get that smell out of my clothes. Oh, God. Oh, God Oh, God, no. Well... what the hell do you want? I assume that that is a rhetorical question. You assume whatever you goddamn well please. It ain't no skin off my ass. Is that what you want me to think? That you're a silly boy? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God, you have to help me. These people are crazy. Please, come on. Let's go. - Let's get out of here. Please. - It's all right. Shush. Shush. There, there. There, there. Come on, now. Come on. Come on. Shh. There. That's better. Shh. Come on, now. Shh. Shh. Come on. It's all right. It's all right. Just sit down. There you go. There. That's all right. There, that's fine. You just stay there. It's gonna be fine, okay? Come on, now. Shh, shh. It's all right. It's all right. Come on. There, see? What is this? No? Can anybody else tell? Things are gonna change. I can promise you that. You just sit there. - No. No. No, don't go, please. - You just sit there. No. Fuck! This is appalling. You are here for one reason... and one reason only. Do you understand that? I want to hear you say you understand that. No? It's very simple. I want these people to know the meaning of horror. Horror. Is that clear? You don't want to be a silly boy. Is... that... clear? Is... that... clear? Fuckin' A it is. What-- What-- What are you-- what are you doing? Why a woman like you has anything to do... with this... cripple... is a mystery to me. Bastard, you know exactly why I'm here. What are you, what are you gonna do? Oh, God. I don't want anything! Oh, no! Oh, God. Oh, no! What? What? What are you doin' now? Don't. It's not your fault! Stop that! Stop it. Stop. It's not your fault! Stop! Don't! Please don't! Get her, get her, get her! Get her, Leather! Get her, Leather! We got some more fun today! Vilmer! Get that bitch! Go! Thank you, Mrs. Spottish. It's a beautiful morning. - Stop! Stop! - Don't stop! Don't stop! Stop! Please stop! Oh, God, no! There's a monster chasing her with a chainsaw! Step on it, Mr. Spottish! Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no, no. You have nothing to fear. This... all of this... It's been an abomination. You really must accept my sincere apologies. It was supposed to be a spiritual experience. I can't tell you how... disappointed I am. I suppose it's something we all live with. People like us who strive for something... a sense of harmony. Perhaps it's disappointment that keeps us going. Unfortunately... it's never been easy for me. One of my many failings. Fuck you. Would you like to go to the local hospital... or to a police station? You know, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. Miss? Miss? We will find out what this is all about. This is not the end of it. Oh, my God. Miss? Miss? Do you know who that is, miss? Miss? What the hell is going on around here?
