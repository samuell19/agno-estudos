(grand music) (dramatic music) - Oh, stop it. You're crazy. (woman laughing) (dramatic music) (car starts) (engines rumble) (dramatic music) - Hey, Cole! - Tony boy! How you doing? - Hey, you got in early. How was Nice? - Too many four-star restaurants. I can barely fit into my damn suit. (Tony chuckles) - Well? - Well, I still can't get used to 70-year-old women in string bikinis. They all look kinda like expensive handbags. You got the Porsche? - Yeah. - Let me drive home. - What's going on? You gonna tell me? - What, what? - Come on, tell me. Come on. - Oh, oh yeah, I forgot. I sold a man a yacht. (Tony laughs) And it was a feeding frenzy. All the big designers were there. I was seeing McKnight, Shimada. - Shimada? - Oh, yeah. It was quite a dogfight. And we got the bone. And Argento loved your designs for the master stateroom, Really loved them. It's a green light all the way. - You the man, Cole. - Oh, well, I certainly am wonderful. I do know that. (dramatic music) I'm home. Where's my girl? - [Elizabeth] Welcome home. - There she is. I missed you, angel. You are gorgeous! - (laughing) Cole. - Oh... You've been painting again. - She's working on something really good. - Call me a redneck, but art is not my bag. I got something for you. - (gasps) It's beautiful. It's too much. - In francs maybe, but in dollars, it wasn't too bad. - It's absolutely exquisite. - Well, nothing's too good for my girl. - Thank you. Are you hungry? Gregor left you some food in the kitchen. - I'm starved. You want to join us? - Ah, I oughta get back to the office. - That's your problem, kid. You work too damn hard. I'll call you later. - Sure. - Thanks for the lift. - Goodbye, Tony. (dramatic music) - Elixir of the gods. - Yuck. It tastes like a paint thinner to me. - Come a little closer, baby. I missed you, darling. I can't sleep without you. - I missed you, too. - Did you really? - Yes, why? - I don't know. Are you really happy that I'm back? - Cole, what are you talking about? - Sexy little thing like you. I got eyes in my head. Fellas must come on to you every day. Fellas your own age, huh? - Well, if they do, I don't notice. - Oh, come on. - If you worry so much, you shouldn't leave me here all alone. - What does that mean? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing, I'm just glad you're home. - You know what I think about when I'm away? Not the money, not yachts. You. You. (groaning) - He just walked in. Hang on a moment. Tony's on his way up. - Send him in. - Okay. (knocking) - Cole. - What's up? - I'm gonna drive down to Oregon and pick up some marble samples. - What do you got, some broad stashed down there? - I wish. I got another fax from Rio today. - Ah, the Brazilians. I thought we agreed to bag that. - I know, but they're offering big returns. And I like- - Come on Tony, the whole thing stinks. That's how your dad got screwed. He poured all his own cash in that Cuban fiasco. I warned him. - I've heard the story. - Now you know why I run Maxco today. Do you think I wanted to buy him out? He made this company. But Bo was wiped out. And I paid twice what those shares were worth. Tony, I love you. I think of you as a son. But that's not why I hired you. You're the best designer there is, but I run the company. So why don't we both stick to what we do best? - Sure. (dramatic music) Hey! (moaning) - You don't know what it's like when the three of us are together, being so close to you... - Shhhh. - He treats me like an object. Especially when he's drunk. Promise me you'll never make me feel like that. - Promise. - Will you do anything for me? - Anything. - Okay. Let's start with something easy. (both laughing) - Gotcha. - Who's got who? (sensual music) (soft moaning) - [Tony] This ain't exactly the Ritz. - Mmm. I've been to the Ritz. - Mmm-hmm? It's nice. - Oh. - Uhn uhn. No, these are mine. - Oh, thanks. What am I, room service, huh? You're bad. (both laughing) Oh. Wait right here. - [Elizabeth] What is it? - Ta da! - Oh, that's very cute. - Yeah. - He has your smile. - Yes, he does. See? (Elizabeth laughs) I love you. Tomorrow. (car starts) (screams) - Easy, easy... - Look, take my purse... - Oh, oh, oh, Lizzy, please... Let's just get serious. Do I look like a purse snatcher to you? - How do you know my name? - Boy, you know, this certainly is a comfortable vehicle. Is all this optional, or is it standard? - What do you want? - We have something in common. I'm an artist, too. May I show you my work? Nature stuff mostly. Birds and bees. You know. I'd really like your opinion. Go ahead. Oh. Early stuff. Oh shit. How did that get in there? You know, you are a natural, Lizzy. The camera just loves you. And I like working with you and Tony. So much enthusiasm. - What do you want? - What do I want? Recognition! Appreciation! Look at these! I make magic. I paint with light. Ah, I'm sorry. My artistic temperament. - How much? - Oh, well, we don't want Old King Cole to find a very big hole where his bank account used to be, right? So, let's try installments. Weekly payments of five thousand per. You may skip a payment, but interest and late charges will accrue to your account, FDIC approved. Oh, oh, come on. Don't get upset, Lizzy. I'm a reasonable guy. I'll tell you what. When we get to a hundred Gs, I'll stop. And you can have the prints, the negatives, and you will never see me again. - How do I know that? - Oh, you don't. (gasping) (phone beeping) - [Tony] Hello? - Tony? Tony, somebody knows. Somebody knows about us. - [Tony] Calm down. Who knows? - Some guy! Someone's coming, I gotta go. Greta. I'm sorry. Uh, can you put some towels down in the gym? Cole and I are going diving tomorrow. - Yes, ma'am. (dramatic music) - Gotta get you in the water, kid. That reef they laid down there is great. - I told you, I'm not much of a swimmer. - That's too bad. Spill some paint, my dear? - I got carried away. - The trials and tribulations of living with a budding artist. - So who's going to clean these? - Ah, my huntress from the sea. Nothing in the ocean escapes that woman's spear. I'm gonna change. And you better change, too. - Cole! - Before you give that boy ideas. - Oh, Tony. - [Tony] We can deal with this. - Deal with this? How? He'll find out. He was always going to find out, even if this had never happened. I can't stand this any more. - I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Can I ask you an honest question? If you had to make a choice, Elizabeth, Cole or me? - You. I want you. - Then let's just tell him. - Cole is not a good loser. He'll ruin you, Tony. If he finds out, he'll ruin both of us. He'll make it is life's goal, so telling him is not an option. I've seen what happens to people who cross him. Getting even is a blood sport to him. We have to pay. - I found an interesting photo the other day. A toast, to my two favorite people in the whole world. Thought you might get a kick out of this. - Wow. That's Dad. - Your pop and I were spear-fishing off Cape Lookout, 1962. He gave me almost everything I have. He could have hired anybody, but he believed in me. To your pop. I miss him every bloody day. - To Dad! - Elizabeth? - Mmm? Oh, yes. To Bo. - Are you all right? - I'm tired of drinking. - How can someone be tired of drinking? - It's not funny. You're drunk every night. You've finished half that bottle. - And I might just drink the other half. - Excuse me. - Elizabeth! - You wanna go see if she's all right? - Oh, she's fine. Excuse me for a minute. Don't you ever mouth off to me like that in front of that boy! - [Elizabeth] Then don't treat me like a child! - [Cole] Get over here! - [Elizabeth] Don't touch me! You're drunk, get away from me! - [Cole] Elizabeth! (people chatting) - Nice spread, Cole. You blew my New Year's resolution all to kingdom come. - How the heck are you? - Great. - Tomster! Did you get enough to eat? - Yes, thank you. - Hi, Kenny. - Hi. - How's Emily? - Great, just catching up on the local gossip. - Hey, Tommy. Having a good time? - Yeah. - He was just gang-tackled by a posse of 8-year-old girls. I think he's still in shock. - Why don't we go to the beach and look for some shells. Would you like that? - Cool! - Likes 'em young. - Then what's she doing with you? - She's taken by my gentle soul. - Hey Tommy, I found a cool one. Do you wanna look? (Elizabeth imitates duck quacking) - Who's that? - Hey, Lizzy. - Come on, Tommy, let's go back up to the house. - Oh, you're so rude. Come here. (gasps) - Don't do that, it hurts my feelings. Whoa whoa whoa whoa... Who's your friend? - Let's go. - Hey, pardner. My name's Willie. - Come on, Tommy. Let's go find your daddy. - What a great idea, 'cause I'm starved. Is there any food up there, Tommy? - I guess. - Any pie? - I think so... - That's great, 'cause I love pie. - Serves him right, buying himself a damn Greek boat. - Oh, Cole, if you had your way, you'd scuttle every boat that wasn't built by Maxco Marine. - Who the hell is this? - [Tommy] Daddy? - Hey, big guy. Did you find some shells? You okay, Tommy? C'mon, let's get you some lemonade. - Cole. Cole Sheridan, what a pleasure. I've heard so much about you. - I'm sorry sir, but I don't believe I've ever met you. - Uh, Willie. Oh, Lizzy, you never mentioned me? That really hurts. My cousin, my little cousin Lizzy. Boy, we used to get up to some stuff, didn't we, Liz? - You two must be close. She never lets anyone call her Liz. You never told me about your cousin Willie, Liz. - Of course I did. We spent some summers in Switzerland. - Yeah. Freelance photographer. We're doing a spread on coastal motels. Black and white, neon, a lot of retro stuff. You know what that's like... - We're happy to have you here. Oh, this is Tony Blanchard. Tony, this is Elizabeth's cousin, Willie... - Kassel. - Pleasure. - We build boats. He does all the interior designs for our yachts. - Don't I know you? - I don't think so. - Gee, that's funny. You know, you look really familiar. - What are you drinking, Willie? Little bourbon? - That's perfect. - [Cole] Let's go get the good stuff. - Is that him? - Yeah. He just came out of the bushes. He kissed me. (dramatic music) - Hey, don't worry about it. It's gonna be all right. He wants money, we'll give him money. Hey, hey, hey, nosy. - Just looking at your things. Where'd you get this box? It's beautiful. - It was Dad's. He found it at a bazaar in the Philippines. Pulled it out of storage a few weeks ago. Are you okay? - I'm so scared. - Come here. (phone rings) - [Answering Machine] Hi, this is Tony. Leave a message, I'll get back to you. (answering machine beeps) - Hi, lovebirds. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. Hey, let's get together tonight. What do you say? I know a romantic spot. Laughlin Lake. There's a clearing just past Richmond on Route 99. There's a small highway sign, and a dirt road just beyond it. Turn down that road and drive to the clearing. Eleven o'clock? Don't forget my present. And Lizzy, come alone. No chaperones, otherwise... (imitates buzzer) Game's over. You lose. Oh, and guys? Really disappointed there was no show today. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for a refund on my ticket. - That son of a bitch! You are not going. - We've gotta pay him. - No, I'm not gonna let you go. That guy's a psycho, just let me take care of this. - We have no choice. I'm going. (dramatic music) (birds hooting) - Boo! Come on out and play, Lizzy, come on. What, have I got some kind of disease? Come out! Give me the money. Come on, give me the money. Come on, come on. Come on outside. (screaming) Let it down! Let it down! - Okay! - Get out of the car. Get out. Get out! (grunting) Stop it! This is not fun for me. (grunting) You weren't invited... - Get the gun! Shoot him! Shoot him! (gun fires) (gasping) - Tony? Did I kill him...? Oh, God... - Listen, you had to. He would have killed me. - But this can't be happening. No, no, no, this can't be happening. - Shhh, it's okay. Shhhh. It's okay. - No, it's not okay! I just shot a man! What am I going to do? - We'll figure something out, okay? - I killed somebody. No, I can't believe this. We've got to go to the police. - We can't do that. - We have to tell them what happened. We have to tell them the truth, and then- - And then, and then they'll arrest us. First degree murder. - Oh... Oh no. - Fuck! Fuck! Maybe we can get rid of the body... - What are you talking about? Listen to what you're saying. - You shot a man who was blackmailing us. - He was going to kill you! - Look, we don't have a lot of choices here. It's either that or the police! - What if he told somebody? - What? - What if he told somebody what he was doing? - What are you talking about? - Him! What if he had a wife or a girlfriend, and told her? - Blackmailers don't talk about what they do, they can't. - How do you know this? - I don't. - Okay. Okay, let's do this. Tony, more pictures. - What could he possibly do with them? Just make sure the car's clean. Elizabeth! Please, get in the truck. Come on, come on, come on! (dramatic music) - Ah, beautiful, beautiful. Cockpit space over there. Ah, it's absolutely comfortable. Perfect. - [Emily] What are the decks made of? - [Ken] Teak. - Excuse me a minute. - [Ken] Sure. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Come on, Elizabeth. Pick up. - [Elizabeth] Hello? - About time. - [Elizabeth] I was in the bath. - I didn't hear you come in last night. - I didn't want to wake you. Marcy made me stay up late. She and Jim are having problems. She needed a shoulder to cry on. - Did you get any sleep? - [Elizabeth] A little. - I've got good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first? - Good. - [Cole] The good news is Lothrop has agreed to sign the contract. - That's great. - The bad news is it's gonna take a few hours to work out the details. But it's not so bad. We're catering in a veritable feast to celebrate. Tony's here, I'd like you to come down and celebrate with us. - I don't feel very well. - [Cole] Oh, Elizabeth, come on. - I'm exhausted. - You're exhausted? - Oh, please don't start... - You're exhausted. You splash paint on a canvas all day like you're in kindergarten. No wonder you're exhausted. You ought to take it easy like I do. (dial tone humming) - Is everything okay? - Oh, the deal is great. Let's reel it in. But Elizabeth, she can't come. She's under the weather. (dramatic music) - 1950 Overton Terrace... (owls hooting) (knocking) (doorknob rattling) Hello? Hello? (dramatic music) (furniture crashing) (grunting) (flames roaring) (crying) - To the Emily. May she sail bravely and safely on the high seas. And may you be nestled sweetly and romantically in your stateroom. - Well said. Thank you. - Cheers. (phone rings) I'll get that. Maxco Marine. - (crying) Can you get away? I have to see you. - What's wrong? (Elizabeth crying) Shhh, calm down. Calm down. - I need you. I have to see you. - I'm in the middle of a meeting. Elizabeth... - I did something terrible. Terrible. (crying) - (frustrated groan) Where are you? Are you all right? What's wrong? Elizabeth? Talk to me. - I burned it. - What are you talking about? - The house. Kassel's house... - What? - I tracked him down from the receipt I found in his car. I had to do it. You can't believe what was there. I mean, there was so many pictures. - You torched his house? Oh, I can't believe this. What the fuck were you thinking? - He had film, videotape, pictures. I didn't know what else to do. - You didn't know what else to do, so you just torched the place? Great! - It was deserted, I swear! We'll figure something out. - How? Don't! (gasping) (tires screech) (engine roars) - Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Elizabeth and Cole, a toast to our love. (glass breaks) I thought I'd find you here. Baby, you scared the hell out of me last night. Where were you? - I was, uh... - Not gonna tell me, huh? - Cole, we have to talk. - Are you gonna leave me? - I don't know. - Can we get it back? - Maybe it's too late. - Elizabeth, don't say it's too late. I love you. - You don't, not any more. I hardly ever see you. And when you're in the house, you just drink. You're drunk every night now. You scare me. You've changed. You're mean, angry. You're like a different person. I can't stand it any more, Cole. I hate you when you're like that. - I know I have a problem. - Remember when we used to laugh? We used to laugh all the time. That little restaurant on Charlotte Street... - Gino's. - Yes, Gino's. We were so happy there. - And we could barely pay the check. And I used to sit in that window table waiting for you and then you'd come up the street, so beautiful. I felt sick. You know, my heart beat so quickly, I couldn't breathe. - That's why you never ate anything? - Don't say that it's over. Don't say I don't love you. You're the most precious thing in the world to me. I don't want to live without you. I can't live without you. And if it means you stay, I won't drink. I don't need to drink. Oh, hell. Maybe I do need to drink. I mean, everybody that drinks needs a reason. But I have a reason to stop. Please, Elizabeth, give me another chance. Let's start over. We'll make it like it used to be. - Let's try. - [Radio DJ] It's a beautiful morning downtown. Partly cloudy on the coast, but clearing up later today. And now we continue with the soft sounds in Seattle with one of my favorites. (soft music) - You're cooking! - In the morning, you're cute. You're a cutey pie. You are, and I love you. Bacon and eggs coming up. - Do I have time for a run? - If you're quick. - Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs. (soft music) ♪ When I wake up in the morning ♪ ♪ The heartache begins ♪ ♪ He's gotten jealous in his ways ♪ ♪ 'cause I loved him ♪ ♪ Should I run away ♪ ♪ Or should I stay ♪ ♪ Does he need me ♪ ♪ I feel I can't believe ♪ ♪ He orders me around ♪ ♪ Tells me to behave ♪ ♪ Should I run away ♪ ♪ Or should I stay ♪ ♪ Should I run away ♪ ♪ Or should I stay ♪ ♪ Lately I've been thinkin' ♪ ♪ Is it time for me to leave ♪ ♪ Spread my wings, fly to the sea ♪ ♪ Should I stay ♪ - You're a celebrity. (Elizabeth chuckles) I owe you an apology. Sometimes I forget how important painting is to you. I'm looking at all these people, very impressive. And some of them are the wealthiest in town, you know, so you could pick yourself up a little change. (both chuckling) There's the boy. - Ah, you two are fashionably late, as usual. Elizabeth, your new painting's wonderful. - My husband was just telling me that. So I hear you're off to New York tomorrow. - I think we're finally gonna close the Shimada deal. - Your flight's at three, right? So give me a ride to the airport. I got a four o'clock to San Francisco. - All right. - San Francisco? You didn't tell me. - Oh, didn't I? I'm sorry, honey. - What about our weekend? - Our anniversary's this weekend, and it's gonna be a special one. Don't worry, I'm only going overnight. - Promise? - Just you and me and our little house by the sea. - So, you still on the wagon? - Yeah. Two weeks this Wednesday, and I feel great. Four sets of tennis this morning. And right now, I feel like a, a mineral water. Can I get you anything, baby? - Whatever you're having. - All right. Tony? - I'm fine, thank you. Can't seem to get you on the phone. Why are you doing this? I want to apologize for the outburst at the diner. We got away with it. All of it. We can get through this, we can get through anything. I miss you, and I know you miss me. - Stop it. - (sighs) That's it, huh? - What do you want me to say? - I want you to say that it's not over. - It has to be. - We killed someone. You killed someone. You gonna pretend that didn't happen either? - It happened. But it doesn't mean we have to spend the rest of our lives reliving it. I can't look at you without thinking of that night. It's over, Tony. - Honey. They're all talking about your painting. - Are they? - Most of them are sucking up to get a discount on their next boat, but a few of them are sincere. And I'm so proud of you. And you are beautiful. And I love you. (engines rumbling) Don't let the son of a bitch get away from you. You hooked him, you can land him. - Don't worry, it's only a formality. Thank you. - An 18 million dollar formality, right. - Shimada's a straight shooter. And speaking of shooters, how 'bout a toast to sealing the deal, hmm? - Can't. A guy like me can't have just one. - "A guy like me." Oh, come on, Cole. I've seen you tie on a few, but that doesn't make you an alcoholic. - Maybe not. But what I am is a man who made a promise, and I'm gonna keep my word. - Ed Forcade is gonna drag you into every bar in San Francisco tonight. You think you're gonna be able to survive that unscathed? - I'm planning on it. - All right. That is good. Just kidding. Wish me luck. - Go get 'em, kid. - I'll talk to you next week. - Can I bring you another this evening? - Uh, no. I'm fine. I'm not a drinking man. (phone rings) - Good morning, Maxco Marine. - [Tony] Good morning, Tina. - Tony, hi! How's New York? - Hot, hot, hot. Is Cole back yet? - [Tina] No, he's still in San Francisco. He won't be back 'til tonight. - Listen, I can't find the damn blueprint to the galley. Cole must have pulled it. Could you check his office for me? - Well, I'm in Cole's office right now, but I don't see any tubes here at all. - Can you do me a favor? Call Elizabeth, have her check at home. And, uh, when you find them, call me back immediately. - [Tina] Okay. - Thanks. (phone rings) - Hello? Oh, hi, Tina. What's the name of the boat? The Shogun Knife... Okay, I'll take a look. Bye. (dramatic music) - My name is William Kassel. I'm a private investigator in the state of Washington, P.I. license number 1638. This file and videotape represents edited surveillance of Elizabeth Sheridan from March, 1999 to the present, requested by her husband, Cole Sheridan. All surveillance materials remain the property of Cole Sheridan, to be used at his discretion in any forthcoming legal action, including divorce. (dramatic music) - Daddy's home, baby! Where are you? (Cole humming) Hey, darlin'! Caught an earlier flight. - Good trip? - Oh yes, but I have a slight confession to make. I had a couple of teenie weenie ones down there. I mean, you know what these business dinners are like. Can't just not drink. - So you had a few more drinks at lunch today, and a couple of teenie weenie ones on the plane back, and, uh... - That's exactly. I knew you would understand. You are very understanding. I'm just gonna have one more little one, so I don't go to sleep on you. I'll be on the wagon tomorrow, I promise. - I have a better idea. Why don't you go upstairs and take a nice shower. Then you can take a nap, sleep it off. And tomorrow- - Are you forgetting, my precious? - Forgetting what? - We're supposed to have dinner at Gino's. Why do you think I busted my ass getting an early flight? You know, there's something I want to tell you. Listen to this. I'm at the men's room at the airport. Some fellow next to me's taking a leak and guess who he was? - I don't know. - Your cousin Willie. (chuckles) More painting. You don't know when to stop. Let me take a look at that. What an interesting combination of colors. - Cole, look out! - Give an old man a hand. - I've been working on this piece for a week. It was a special commission. - I think that's an improvement. - You're drunk. - I said I'm sorry. - You are? You have a strange way of showing it. - Hey, truce? Why don't you and I go upstairs and- - Have a little drinkie-poo? A little champagne, maybe? No, Cole! Thank you! Damn you! Damn you! (dramatic music) (door slams) (gasping) (knocking) (lock clicks) - Elizabeth? Let me in, please. (door rattling) Come on, Elizabeth. Please? Let me in. Come on, honey. Elizabeth, please. (crashing) - Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No! (Elizabeth crying) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (people talking quietly) (door slams) - Big speargun, three or four bands. Must have been real close. - You find it? - Not yet. - Keep looking. Thank you. (dramatic music) (knocking) Would you like some coffee? - Thank you. - Mrs. Sheridan, I'm Detective Crawford. I know this is a very difficult time for you ma'am, but, uh, I need to ask you some questions. Mrs. Sheridan? - He's gone. He's really gone. I can't believe this. - Yes. Uh, I'm sorry. Can you think of anyone that might want to kill him? Someone who may have held a grudge against him...? - No. He had a temper, anyone can tell you this. - He had a bad temper? (phone ringing) - Yes. Excuse me. - Mmm-hmm. (car horns honking) - Elizabeth? - Would you excuse me for a moment? - Sure. - I am so sorry. Are you all right? - Yes. I don't know. - Listen, I'm on my way to the airport. I'll be home tonight. - [Elizabeth] There's something else. - What is it? - I found a videotape. Kassel was working for Cole, Cole knew all about us. - What are you saying? That's not possible. - Do you think I don't know this? And what if he knew? What if he knew what we did to Kassel? Maybe he was just playing along. - Kassel is dead. - So is Cole. - Elizabeth, you didn't? - I didn't kill him, if that's what you're asking. - Are the cops there now? - Yes, and they're asking questions. - Where's the videotape? Whatever you do, make sure they don't find it. - Oh no. The tape is gone. - Listen, don't talk to anybody until we get you a lawyer. - I can't believe this is happening. Why is this happening? - Hi. I'm Burt Hiasen. Tony Blanchard gave me a call. My schedule's a little full right now, but Tony's an old friend of the family, and he did a little arm-twisting, so I'm all yours, Mrs. Sheridan. There is what appears to be some very convincing evidence against you. Your prints are on the murder weapon. - I didn't kill him. - Are you familiar with the expression "Beyond a reasonable doubt"? My job, Mrs. Sheridan, is to establish doubt in the minds of the jury. But given the evidence, it may be beneficial to take a different approach. - And what might that be? - The way I think a jury might see it, you killed Cole because you were terrified of him. Afraid for your life. He broke down the door that night. He beat you. He raped you, wasn't the first time. You did what you had to do to make it stop. No one can fault you for that, Elizabeth. We plead to voluntary manslaughter, self-defense 30 months at most. Oh, I can imagine how this must sound. Especially if- Since you didn't kill him. But if we plead innocent, and if we lose, which is more than likely, you'll be looking at twenty years minimum. Now, with a conviction for second degree murder, you forfeit your inheritance in Mr. Sheridan's will. Law says you kill somebody, you don't get their bag of gold. I'm going to try to arrange bail for you. Should have you out of here in a couple of hours. - And what happens to the company? - I don't know. I can certainly find out. - Please. - I'll be in touch. (dramatic music) - [Woman On Phone] Flight 228 will be arriving from New York at 3:15 P.M. Arrivals can be picked up at terminal two. For more flight arrival information, please hit nine now. (camera shutter clicks) (dramatic music) (engines rumbling) - Tony! - Elizabeth? Hey! What are you doing here, huh? - Hiasen bailed me out this afternoon. Tony, Kassel is alive. I know what I saw. - What did you see? - He was at my house outside the window. I'm sure of it. - Ah, that's crazy. Did you get a look at his face? - No. - Honestly, in your state of mind, you're imagining things. Kassel is at the bottom of that lake where we left him, okay? - I don't know. Maybe. You're probably right. - I know I'm right. Now come on, nice little supper, nice little warm bed, okay? - That would be nice. - I closed the deal with the Brazilians in New York. - Great. - Yeah. I got a lot of work to do. - It was really scary being in that jail. I was all alone. - Listen, you've had a long week. Go home. Get some rest. I'll call you tomorrow. - Sure. - Okay? I'll call you tomorrow. - [Phone Operator] City and listing, please? - Yes, Seattle, Washington. William Kassel. K-A-S-S-E-L. - [Phone Operator] I have no Kassel. - Could you check the surrounding areas? Maybe he's not in Seattle. - [Phone Operator] I'm sorry, I'm not showing any listing. - hanks. Here we go. 5353 Calhoun Street... (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) - Yes? - I'm sorry to bother you. I'm looking for Barbara Howell. - Oh, that's my daughter. She's not in right now. I'm Ora Mae. - My name is Elizabeth Sheridan. I hope you can help me, I went to high school with your grandson. I'm trying to get in touch with Willie. - William? - Yes. As I said, I went to high school with William. I just saw him at the airport. - Oh my. I'm afraid you're mistaken. - Oh no, I'm sure of it. - Young woman, as I said, it wasn't William. - I just saw him at the departure terminal a few days ago. - My grandson died of leukemia almost 16 years ago. - I'm so sorry. - You made an honest mistake. I was just about to have some lemonade. Will you join me? - No, I've imposed enough - - I'd enjoy it. - Okay. - Here's your high school yearbook. Here's William. Where are you? - [Elizabeth] He's very handsome. - Here he is on the student council, the photography club, the rugby team... - Wait a minute! - Those boys were inseparable. That Joey Rizzelli was a troublemaker. But Tony Blanchard was such a nice boy. So good to William when he was sick. Are you all right? What's wrong? - [Cole] In the event that Elizabeth Sheridan does not for any reason inherit Maxco Marine, the business in its entirety shall revert to Anthony Blanchard, who will act as and be referred to as my trustee. (dramatic music) - [Elizabeth] Missy Turner acquitted, jury Says Self-defense. Widow found innocent In slaying Of wealthy husband. You set me up. Oh, Tony. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Yeah. Don't worry, I have it. (dramatic music) (engine revving) (indistinct yelling) (knocking) - Yeah? - [Tony] Hey, open the door. - The pizza man's here. Got my order? You know we gotta stop seeing each other this way. - What were you doing at the Sheridan house? - I like to watch. She's a beauty, Tony. I've grown so fond of taking her picture. Uh, pork rind? - You sick fuck, she saw you! What are you thinking, dummy? Huh? You wanna blow the whole deal? - You know what? Life is full of risks. I seem to remember trusting that you would place those oxygen tanks in a spot where I could easily find them. Had my doubts about that plan at first. But all of a sudden, there I was, swimming in that cold, cold water. However, I must admit that my trust in you has weakened since you torched my fucking house. - I didn't torch your fucking house. Are you threatening me? - Does it sound like a threat, Tony? 'Course it's a threat, you stupid shit. That's why I stashed a copy of the videotape. See, risk requires insurance. Call it health insurance, call it whatever you want. But I had to get that tape from your girlfriend's house. It was hard to find, but I got it. In case you get any ideas. - Why do I care if anyone sees that tape? - "Why do I care? Why do I care?" Accessory to murder? - You're being well taken care of. - Am I? See, I figure once I've taken care of Old King Cole, time to renegotiate my contract. Let me tell you what, you know that investigating officer? I think he'd find that tape incredibly enlightening. It's some of my best artistic work. Don't even try to find it. I mean, unless you wanna bust open every bus locker on the Western Seaboard. - Oh, you're a real piece of work. Count it, you'll get another fifty Gs in a couple of weeks. - Damn right I'm gonna count it. 'Cause I'm going south. - Yeah. You're going south. (gun fires) (dramatic music) (tape ripping) - Tony? Call on line one. - Hello? - [Elizabeth] Hi, baby. I want to see you. - Hey. Where are you? What's going on? - [Elizabeth] I have a little present for you. - Oh, really? - [Elizabeth] Oh, really. - And I'm really gonna enjoy this one? - [Elizabeth] Oh yeah, you're really going to enjoy this one. - Can't do it, too busy. - [Elizabeth] Uh-uh, not taking no for an answer. Our usual room, in an hour. - Hello? "The present is under the pillow. You have to guess which pillow." What the? "If you really love me, then play me." - [Tony Voiceover] You'll get another fifty Gs in a couple of weeks. - [Kassel] Damn right I'll count it. 'Cause I'm going south... - Yeah, you're going south. (gun fires) Spirit Falls. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! - Tony! How did you enjoy my little gift? - Put the gun down. Let me explain. - You had Cole killed, you son of a bitch. - Elizabeth, I did that for us! Okay? So we could be together. - I know what you've done. I know all of it. - No, you think you know all of it. You don't get it. Living your life of luxury. Painting your pretty pictures. Pretending you loved me? What did you ever work for? My father built Maxco Marine from the ground up with his own sweat and blood. My father gave your husband everything. No, no, Maxco Marine is my birthright, and I'm just taking back what's rightfully mine and nothing's going to stand in the way of me getting it back. - Am I next, is that it? You're sick. You're not worth it. - Come on, now. I'm not gonna let you go now. (gun fires) That's my gun. Those are blanks. (dramatic music) Elizabeth, wait! (screaming) Elizabeth, help me! - Why should I? - Elizabeth, if you let me die, you're no better than me. Grab my hand! Cimon, grab my hand! I'm slipping, I'm slipping! Elizabeth! Help! Grab my hand! (whimpering) (Tony screams) (water rushing) (panting) - It's beautiful here. So how you doing? You hanging in there? - As well as can be expected. - Tragedy has a way of following you. So what are you gonna do about the business? - Tony was a great friend of the family, and after my husband's death, I don't see myself setting foot back in Maxco Marine. I'm a painter, not a shipbuilder. - Let me cut to the chase. We received a video tape from an anonymous source that removes you from all suspicion in the death of your husband. All charges have been dropped. - Yes, my attorney told me. Thank you. - The investigation's not closed. We're still looking for the source of that video. Well, good luck.
