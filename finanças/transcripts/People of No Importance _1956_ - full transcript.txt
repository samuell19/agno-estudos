Coming! PEOPLE OF NO IMPORTANCE Is this the way to Biarritz? Yes. Biarritz via Bordeaux. Lovely, Biarritz! That's what they say. Do you know the whole coast, the beaches, hotels, casinos, nightclubs... - Hi Emile. - It's been a while since we've seen you. You can't always pick your route. How are you doing? Oh... - Give me a coffee. - Take this one. - Br?get, I'll get you another one. - No hurry. Say, Marchandot, how many maids did you have this morning? - One, of course! - You don't have too many left now. What do you mean? Give me the police. Don't let this stop you from waking me up in an hour and a half. The police station, quickly. - You heard me, an hour and a half? - I'm not deaf. Hello, police? This is La Caravane. Someone took my maid. Evidence? There's only an apron and a pitcher left. Should I save the pitcher for finger prints? OK. A soldier in an American car! She went out to fill it up. Yes, an American soldier! Oh well, poor Marchandot really has no luck with his maids! Even though he pays better than most, he can't hold on to one. Admittedly, at twenty, that's no kind of life for a girl. All-purpose maid all year round in a diner 40 kilometers from town... with only truckers and their tired old stories for entertainment, they want out as soon as they get here. A real revolving door. There was Marie "Not Me", Marie Mantac... and many others. They always got named Marie to avoid confusing them. Except Clo. Perhaps because she wasn't like the others. It's been a good two years since this story took place. It was Christmas Eve. We had just gone through Bordeaux. Berty and I had been driving for 60 hours straight. Take it? Yes. Shit! You must be joking! That's just great! Does my shop window look like a garage to you? - No one touched your precious window. - Not for lack of trying! Drunks should stay in bed! Come on down, and we'll show you how drunk we are. - Souses! - Hey, watch it! Vulgar individual! Merry Christmas! Idiots! - Wake up. Let's go get some sleep. - Who cares? - You're sleeping in the truck? - It's warm. - What? - It's warm. The radiator's warm. I see the big rigs are modern now. Hot water on every floor. Except that cold water matters too. First off, warm water would be better. Plus, I didn't ask you. If I only did what people asked, I wouldn't need to be a waitress. You have a quick tongue. You've been here long? Not long, but I'll start to take root soon if you don't make up your mind. Leave this here. Go back inside where it's warm. - That woke you up? - Not completely, but give it time. - Merry Christmas, guys! - Merry Christmas! Hi Emile. Give us a shot of rum. And then we hit the sack. Not at the bar. Grab a table. It's Christmas Eve. - Why not midnight mass while you're at it? - Sure, why not? Girl, go find what's left of that duck. It'll stand in for turkey. - And a bottle of bubbly. - I'm not hungry. I like turkey. I dream of it. Come sit down! Look, he's still asleep and I'm getting there. - Come and eat! - I'm not hungry. I should be mad at you two! Christmas Eve is no time for anyone to be mad. You're right. Go ahead. Eat. - Here, Jean. - I don't want anything. Could we turn off the radio? What have you got to complain about? You got it all here, mass and party. Exactly. Pass the holy bread. What did you plug in? Bring me the fuse. For me, Christmas is a day of commemoration. I don't mean baby Jesus. I mean my bum leg. And I'm not the only one. You should ask the residents of Cheny! I was driving a tanker. 15,000 liters of petrol! Imagine that. Suddenly, and I have no idea how it happened, I see smoke coming out of the hood. First smoke, then flames. Not the right one. I thought everything would blow up in the square, parishioners everywhere. I just floored it until I made it out of town. Picture a torch flying at 80 kms an hour. Then I jumped. I found myself in a water filled ditch about 10 meters ahead. I wasn't burned, but I lost my pin. I'll tell you something else... I'll tell you... Oh crap! Let them go to bed. You're sleepy too? Off to bed! I'll show you turkey and bubbly! What kind of wimps are you? Say, now that I think of it... Wasn't it on Christmas Eve that it happened, with your leg? Yes. That's what I thought. Marie... Why "Marie"? All maids here are named Marie. It's a nice name. The name of a virgin. I see. Except that my name is Clothilde. Wake us up in any case in an hour and a half. Don't forget, okay? Virgin or not... What is it? I just wanted to give this to you. If you don't mind, it'll save me from having to get up again. OK. - Was that all you wanted? - Why? You expected something else? You never know. On this night, it could have been Santa Claus coming by. - Hang your stocking by the chimney. - Sure, but... You won't fit in my stocking. Anyway, I don't believe in Santa anymore. Marie... Clothilde!.. - Tell me... - What, not sleepy anymore? Not sleepy! You're a piece of work! You wake me up, and then you leave. You haven't been here long? Are you sure that's what you wanted to ask me? It's odd to see you here tonight. At your age, you should be out dancing. Don't tell me Marchandot refused to give you Christmas Eve off. No, I'm the one who refused. Why, you don't like to dance? So? You must have a family. Sure, my mother lives in Bordeaux. - And your dad? - He's a substitute. I'd say it's a bust. Some Christmas Eve party, eh? In any case, we're in a compromising position. We're in comfy digs at the stroke of midnight, and begin by breaking the bed. So the hard part is done. "Hard part... " After 1500 kms... What's your name again? Oh yes, Clothilde. Clo. Not Clothilde. "Clo". Me, I'm Viart, Jean Viart. Jean, if you prefer. Oh, I have no preferences. It's about time. It's a little early to be such a pain in the ass. I've already asked you not to be so familiar, M. Viart. He's not being familiar, he's telling you to piss off. I'll go check the controlograph. You must like the idea of an automated snitch. Bet you wish you'd thought of it. - I'm just doing my job. - You call that a job? Get going. I'll take care of the rest. - What's this two-hour stop? - Two hours of rest. - You don't scrimp, do you? - No. It was either two hours or eternal rest. We couldn't see anything. Nice try, but you're here to make a report, not to interrogate. Have fun. Let me go crash. - Very well, you'll explain to the boss. - That's right. What are you doing? - Do you mind? - You have a place. This isn't a dormitory. I live on the other side of Paris, and I'm wiped out. Do you know what it's like to be wiped out? I'll tell you. If I'm single, it's to be left alone when I need to sleep. Got that? Good night. M. Viart, I have something for you. - There's mail delivery today? - It's not mail, and it's from last night. Come. It's warmer inside. Your wife left this for you. She wanted you to put this on before you came in and to bring in the kid's toys she left on the landing. To play Santa. That's all I needed. To think I was hoping to go straight to bed. What can you do? If we were always in bed, we'd eventually get tired of it. M. Viart! Tell your wife we need to discuss a present for the mailman. - I still have the calendar he left for you. - I'll tell her. Also, you need to sign our petition to have the owner fix the roof. Only your signature is missing. - Coming back from a binge? - Some binge! I didn't see the toys on the landing. - The kids are up? - Do you think they waited up for you? - Make up your mind. What do you want? - For you to have come home last night. Put in a request with the boss. As soon as we got to Bordeaux, we found a load for Bayonne. And then back again. - A freight run like that isn't unusual. - Unusual would be Christmas at home. - Always with the nagging. - To you, talking is nagging. I'll grab a bite and go get some sleep. Do what you want. I stay out of your business. Let's not start this again. I just drove 3000 kms. - You always say that. - Because it's always true! When I get home, I don't want to be listening to your griping. - I'll shut up if that's what you want. - I want piece and quiet, get it? So what do we do about the kid? We give him his toys now? Well? You put them in the chimney? You won't even give me credit for trying. You could hang your wash in the courtyard. Can't even move in here. - Jacqueline is just getting in now? - Leave her alone. You can find your tongue to defend her. At 17, your daughter has the right to go out on Christmas Eve. - And the right to hear my opinion. - I don't want her stuck with my life. - What life? - Endless menial work. I spend my life scrubbing while you're off wandering. Are you having a laugh? Where's the... Leave it! I'm bushed. What a night. Hi, mom. Oh, he's here? Yup, he's here. That's my bathrobe. This is too much. - You hardly ever wore it. - Your mother's idea. - I bought it myself. - Yeah, with money I gave you. With money I made! You call 180 a month money? I suppose that's enough for selling cologne from behind a counter. Then don't stand in the way of my true calling. Some calling. You call working as an extra twice a month a calling? That's how you get started. Someday, I'll be in real movies. That's what I've been told. To you, only getting your hand greasy qualifies as work. How would you like my hand on your face? - Don't start again you two. - He's the one provoking me. He can't stand it that I'm so elegant. There's more to being elegant than wriggling your ass. All right, we know you're an expert on women. A nice job benefit. - Will you shut up? - Hitting too close to home? Please, Solange, make her shut up for God's sake. Please! How? She's not 5 years old anymore. Hell of a Christmas day... So, Santa doesn't exist? Happy now? Hello folks. Direct from producer to consumer. Barely damaged. Give me some white wine. - Marie! - No more Marie. She left? She found a new "position" in town. I guess this place wasn't good enough. - Come on, Jean! - What? They get their asses in gear to take off, but not to work. She spent all of 8 days here. A record. - One for the road? - Pleased with yourself? I feel so much better on this side of the bar. - You're not getting a severance. - Don't grouse. I didn't ask for one. Now I'm stuck. - 2-0 - Jean, are you blind today? What? What? 3-0! - D'you bribe him? Move. I'm better off. - Time to go. Enough with this contraption. You're the ones going to Bordeaux? - That's us. - Can you give me a ride? - Your new position is in Bordeaux? - Sure. We're not made for the country. I'm especially not made for lemonade. OK, come on. We'll make some room for you. 4-0! What do you expect? I'm all alone. It's not nice to leave us this way. You don't exactly stick around, do you? Not the same thing. It's my job to pass through. And no one complains that you pass through too quickly? Sure, just not the people I'd like to complain. - How do you know? - What do you mean? Don't laugh, but it feels like I had a nice Christmas Eve. And you? - You're getting mushy. - Only with you. OK, it's time for you to get out of here. Get in. Coming! Here we are. - Goodbye, Clo. - Goodbye, Jean. Jean, we're in the way. Hey! Get a move on! JOKE SHOP The Tricky Devil Party Tricks No one is in. Mlle Clothilde! What a surprise! You seem in good health. It's the country air. My mother's around? She went to hear your stepdad at the bandstand. Let's hope he's happy to see you. - Are you staying long? - Long enough to find work. A concert just for you? Oh, you're here? See? It's Armand. I'm fine, thanks. Are you still with your friend? Robert, I think. I left him. He came to make a scene in the store. They fired me. What now? I found a position at a roadside diner. Are you happy there? I'm happy I left there. I told them I found work in town. I hope that'll be true. Mom, you know why I came. Won't you help me? - I know why you came? - You know I came to ask a favor. I wish your visit had no other motive. You know we're always struggling to make ends meet. I'm not asking for money. I'd just like to stay at home for a few days. - A few days? - Long enough to find work. I'm afraid nothing has changed at home since you left. - Still obsessing? - It's not an obsession. Armand is younger, much younger than me. And he's a man. - Don't be foolish. - I know what I'm talking about. We can't all be on top of each other in those two small rooms. - Figuratively speaking. - Clo! Mom, I asked you something. Say yes or no, and we'll be done with it. You're too old to be relying on your mother. I haven't in 15 years. You must understand that parents are entitled to their own lives. What are you doing here? - Oh, having fun. Can't you tell? - You're looking for us? I'm looking for a truck. Any truck. - And your position? - It'll still be warm, back at Marchandot's. I thought you had a job lined up here. - You believed that too? - I only believed what you told me. You don't know the first thing about party tricks. Oh, hi! - So. Dropping you off at Marchandot's? - You don't even have to stop. They'll just say it was a suicide and you won't have any problems. Get in. You're not going to do anything stupid, are you? I'm going back to Marchandot's. Isn't that enough? OK, let's go. Look. I used to fish for roach here. - With flaxseed? - No, wheat. - Caught any? - No. How do you know you were fishing for roach? Are you done whining? Hey pal, do you think you're remote-controlled? Oh, I'm already at St-Aubin Farm? Yes, but the way you're driving, you'll soon be in heaven. Funny. I was just dreaming I was there. Pierre, go keep him company. I'll meet you at Emile's. Let's have a look. There. Better? Let's go. Don't you mind staying alone with me? Eh? It doesn't matter in any case. I could be your father. I hadn't noticed. But it's true. Why do you look at me like that? If it bothers you, I could turn around. You're on the shy and closed-off side. And you're not. So we average out. Are you married? Yup. What's your wife like? You're awfully curious. She's like a lot of women, but with 3 additional kids. We should get going. Berty will start imagining things that aren't there. What things? Can't we take a 10 minute vacation? Vacation? You make a lot of sense. You're making progress. You're also looking at me. Why? You're not unpleasant to look at. - Look... - What? Maybe you should check out the fuel injector first. Are you nuts? In this flood? It'll take at least an hour to fix. At least, we'd be stopping here for a real reason. What are you saying? I'm saying we'll get in trouble. For the past 5 months, we've been stopping at Emile's on each trip. So? Come on. On a Paris-Bordeaux trip, a rest stop 60 kms before the end? Then 60 kms after we start back? That's not normal. And? So what? Do what you want. You're a pain. Start up the engine. In the sunny land... Don't you know another song? We're already an hour behind schedule. I gotta wash my mitts. - Hello. - Hi. The truck has been acting up. I only have 5 minutes left. 5 minutes a week. At this rate, by the time we turn 80, we'll have spent about 3 days together. Get a desk job. Then we could make appointments. Don't you realize that in my job, we're at the mercy of a bunch of things? One day it's a flat tire. Another time, it's the fog or an icy road. In the 5 months we've been together, you haven't stopped blaming me. You call this being together? You stop by twice a week. I'm not always free. When I am, you're late. So we always wind up meeting for 15 or even 5 minutes, like today. It's not love anymore. It's a routine. So, you want to do the routine? The raincoat would make a change. - You're lucky I care about you. - You really believe that? - That I care about you? - That I'm lucky. Ferchrissakes, Clo, I've promised to get you out of this place. That too is a routine. You're a riot. It's not that simple! I have to keep earning. I still have a wife and kids. I can't just drop them. I've been with Solange 23 years. I have nothing against her. You're always throwing your wife and kids in my face. I still have to think about them! - Don't tell me you're jealous of them. - I don't know. I know that if I didn't care about you, I wouldn't get in this state. Look, I have an idea. Skip your next day off. In 2 weeks, you'll have 2 days. We'll spend them in Bordeaux. I promise. How will you manage? I'll manage. - Another promise... - I swear to you. - On your wife's head? - Let's leave her out of this. - Look, Jean... - Clo! What are you up to? - Jean... - What? It's the first time we part like this. Normally, we talk a lot less. Yes... The routine. Are you finished? Can I get in there? No, I'm naked. - I saw your bottom before you. - You'd find it's changed a lot. Pass me that jacket on the chair. Just hang on. My hands are wet. Relax. You're leaving for 4 days. I still need to leave on time. You always want to leave on time. But coming back... I come back when I can. It's not my fault I have to spend 2 days in Bordeaux. We only see you long enough to say goodbye. Tell me, Jacqueline... Who's this Francis? - Which Francis? - What? There's more than one? - Hey, I don't open your letters! - You're not the father of a dingbat. - I want to know who this guy is. - A pal. None of your business. A pal! "My dove: Stop by Girardot's studio. He's agreed to hire you. " What does this mean? It means you'll soon see my picture everywhere. - Annoyed? - Your picture... - Is this what you're dreaming of? - It's an art photograph. The art of exciting soldiers in their barracks. If that's the kind of work, I'd rather not see you in photos, or at all. Oh, you want me to go! Is that it? - I don't want to police my own house. - Like you're ever in it... Of course you had to join in... Bye, dad. - There's a hitch - What? M. Viart, management asked me to assign you to a new route. - You're leaving right away for Strasbourg. - What's the idea? The idea is that you were getting too comfortable on the Bordeaux route. You were getting regularly delayed at Km 424. At La Caravane to be exact. - You played a nasty trick on me. - Management's orders. Orders after hearing from a snitch. What did you tell them? M. Viart, it's already 8:40. Who cares? Just give me my route back. It's too late. The order's from the top. Let's go. We'll deal with it tomorrow. Tomorrow? What if I refused to leave? Get going. He can do as he wishes. He's on the phone. What's the hurry? - He refuses to leave. - He only said, "if I refused. " M. Berty, your job is at stake. Hello? Is this Marchandot? I can't hear. Is it you Emile? It's Viart. Can you go get Clo? Hurry! I'll wait. Clo? I can't make it tonight. I can't make it tonight! Tomorrow either. I'll try in a few days. Don't be angry. It's not my fault. Clo? Where are you? We have customers waiting! M. Viart... Don't bother. Berty left alone. Tellier... I'm warning you the least violence... No need to run snitching. I'll go get my severance. Wow, you really took one. Clo! Two specials. - 300 kms later, a flat tire. - Marie, same again! I have no luck. Hey, are you crazy? That phone call scramble your head? What's going on? She should put her ass under glass if it's so sensitive. Go to the bar. And you, try to behave! Behave? It wasn't me! ANNUAL TRUCKERS BALL Let's try to find a table. Sit here. Come sit down if you aren't too ashamed of us. I'm looking for someone. Plus the thought of sipping beer with you... Jean, I know you're not here for that but I'd like to dance just this once. - It'll make us feel younger. - Sure, if you like. Keep an eye on your brother. Be good. See, we have no luck. - Hi, Viart? - Hey! - Things going well? - No, things are pretty dead. Still no work? My company's head of personnel is here. I can have a word with him. I don't want to bug you with that. - Don't worry. - Thanks a lot. Run along and play. You want another pitcher? It's on Philippe. M. Viart. You let yourself get snagged? He can't understand my appeal. Want to dance? Sure. Shall we dance, Jean? Wait a bit. Br?get is speaking to his boss for me. So? Let me explain... Not hiring? He's hiring but not like this. I know my job. It's not a matter of skill, Viart. - You mean he things I'm pushing it. - Yes. I'm afraid it'll be like that everywhere. I know. Thanks anyway. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to see you. Now that I see you, I don't even feel like yelling at you. Because you can sense I wouldn't stand for it today? No. Because I know you wouldn't answer any more than you did with my letter. What letter? Come dance. We'll attract less attention. See? My old man still gets around. What letter were you talking about? You look so innocent. Is it what I wrote that's scaring you? If you had written to me, I would have answered. - Where did you send it? - The address you left me. - At the garage? - You're very convincing. I'm telling you the truth. I don't know what you wrote, but I have to warn you, I'm full up with problems. I've been fired from my job. If your letter went to the garage, that's where it will stay. What happened to you? Viart, Br?get told me you were looking for a job. I have a good gig for you. A cattle car to drive from Villedieu to Bordeaux. Their only available driver got sick. Tell them Br?get asked you to call. - It's just for one trip. - Yes, but with a bonus. Look, thanks. But I'm not retired yet. - I just thought that... - Oh you're very nice. But you understand... So? You still haven't told me. What did you write to tell me? You have enough on your mind. It was really nothing. They saw us. You have to come with me. Thanks, Pierre. Here's your partner back. - Let me introduce you... - Clothilde Brachet. Clo... Solange Viart... Max... Jacqueline Viart. I've seen you somewhere before. Shall we sit down? Clo's a friend from the country. She arrived this morning. She's looking for work. I was about to ask if you could help her out a little. M. Viart is already busy taking care of his family. And we're leaving out the youngest. Madame Vaco! What is it? The faucet in No. 14 is clogged. Put him in No. 8. Must I tell you everything? I hope you'll be less thick. Good thing she only works mornings. May I know the terms? 100F a month plus tips. You'll always get tips. The ladies know what's expected. No, thanks. I'm feeling a little queasy. A problem in this line of work. Anyway, all that matters here is to be discreet. I'll wind up a diabetic. When do I start? If you're clear on everything, as soon as possible. - Could you give me a few minutes? - An hour if you like. I'll leave my suitcase. - A brothel? - You have anything better? - Does it pay? - Depends on the tips. Jean... Do you know what I gained when I came to Paris? - Probably nothing. - You're wrong. I met your wife. - She just came to the ball... - I'm not blaming you. Still, I got to see them... Your wife, your kids, your problems. I've thought it over. I think we should go our separate ways. What will it be? - What would you like? - Nothing. - Some red wine. - Beaujolais? Sure. Don't talk nonsense. Just let me find some work, and I'll drop everything. With all the driving I do, Solange has gotten used to living without me. Won't make a difference to her. I'll go on supporting them. With what? - I'll manage. - Poor Jean. I too used to think you were resourceful. What's sad is that you really are a good man. "Good man... " Good but not strong. Maybe that's it. - You're leaving? - I'm starting work right away. - I brought us something to eat. - I'm not hungry. You can't go to work on an empty stomach. Shall I come see you tomorrow? - Jacqueline. - Just a minute. Come eat. The eggs are done. - I'm getting changed. - Hurry. Your brothers will soon be here. We can never manage to eat together. It's like a restaurant here. I thought you were eating in town. I didn't make anything for you. I only need a piece of bread. I have cheese. Here's Miss Camembert! 45% fat. Direct from Vall?e d'Auge. You knew about this? I'm also on the premium line. The one the director will be eating when he notices you? This is too much. I'm the only making money, and I get blamed for it. Look at you putting on airs. Do you realize we'll be a laughingstock to everyone? To everyone, and to someone in particular. I'm getting tired of this. What are you implying? Only the truth. Guess what? I've got a label on you too. Right here. Score it 15 all. - What's that? - What you get for angering Tellier at the garage. - He forwarded your mail. - Give it to me! Mom, listen... Her name is Clo. "My dear Jean... " "I don't know how you'll take the news. " Do you know what the news is, mom? I'm about to have a little brother, and you had nothing to do with it. "Although I'm never sure of anything... "... I'm certain that I'm pregnant... " Jacqueline! You're the one who started opening my letters. I think I'm done here, Solange. - Hey dad, I got 3rd place this week. - Well done, big guy. Hurry up. Mom has lunch ready. - Can I use your phone? - Go ahead. Lorette Company? Br?get told me to call. Are you still looking for someone to pick up that truck in Villedieu? I was with OGT for 4 years. I have to leave this afternoon? 3:12 Montparnasse station? Is there a later train? No? OK, I'll stop by right away. Goodbye. Modern Hotel? May I please speak to Clo? It's urgent. Why can't she come to the phone? I'm telling you it's urgent! I know she's there. - How much? - 60 cents. Come on, dad, I didn't do it on purpose. I'll tell her I was just kidding. I don't want mom to pay the price for this. It's you again? What? I can't hear you. You're calling from Montparnasse? Hi, Monique. Go on up. We'll settle things later. No, I've already told you Clo isn't here. Today is her day off. Coming! Don't go. Give the girl something, baby. More? This is getting expensive. Don't be tight. House rules. What manners. I'll be back in just a minute. You're obviously new at this. Let me give you some advice. Never grumble again. If the boss knew, she'd fire you on the spot. If they're louts, let it go. Otherwise, they leave and don't even pay us. - What good is that? - What's going on? - Is there a problem? - No. Clo, take care of this couple. Don't bother. We won't be long. What's the matter with you? You're acting strange. Are you feeling dizzy? - It's nothing. I'm just a little tired. - After just a few hours of work? Have some candy. Feeling queasy again? Look at me. You're pregnant, my girl. You knew that? You could have told me. - I needed the work. - So? I'm not a monster. Go lie down a little. I like you, Clothilde. I'm willing to be a mother to you, but not a grandmother. Smoke? What are you planning to do now? You can't afford to raise this child. Which means you can afford even less to not have it. Understand that I can't keep you in this state. Imagine how clients would feel. - I'm used to packing up. - Who said anything about packing up? If I fire you, I'm without a maid. Who will I find to replace you? I'm better off keeping you... and giving you the help you're hoping for. What am I hoping for? Oh, I don't know... that I'll give you an address for example? Where you'll find a friend who's careful, discreet and skilled. Unless you see another solution? I'll let you think about it. Of course, you wouldn't receive any wages for a few months. What can you do? These days, nothing's free. Yes? Mme Vaco sent me. I see. Come in. Germaine! - Hello. - Hello. You must be Clo. Leave us. Mme Vaco called me about you. I'm sure you know in this kind of situation the biggest danger is a loose tongue. - I know. - Fine. Make yourself comfortable. Please give me a few moments. Don't worry. Everything will be just fine. Please sit down. - How long have you been... - Three months. Good. Mme Vaco! Are you done yelling? What is it? There's a man to see you. He insists. - Hello. We haven't had the pleasure of... - And you won't. Where is Clo? You're the one who called yesterday? Good timing. I didn't, and my timing is my business. Just tell me where she is. - Please leave immediately. - Give it a rest. Where is Clo? She's in bed with the flu. Satisfied? Sure, yesterday, she was out, and today she's got the flu. - I'll find her myself. - What are you doing? - I'll open every door until I find her. - Enough! Go up to No. 25. Too bad if she's contagious. Berty. I'm sorry. I thought she was lying to me. Don't worry. She probably did. I always have flu medicine on me. - Would you like some? - Too late. It's full blown now. You still have to take care of yourself. Jean called me. I have some good news. He left his family. He's leaving for Bordeaux tomorrow. That's good news for whom? For you! He's taking you along. That poor Jean. It's better this way for everyone. Even for Solange. When they're apart, they can't hurt each other. So? - What do you think? - I don't have the strength to think. That's right. Clear your mind until tomorrow morning. He should be getting in around 8:00. He's meeting us on the docks. I'll come get you early. - OK? - OK. See you tomorrow. Home delivery. Thanks, bud. Well... then... goodbye. Berty... You're a great guy. It's easy when you don't have problems. You'll soon see. The garage forwarded your letter. Why didn't you tell me? You had so many problems. And I wasn't completely sure. - And now? - Now I know I was wrong. See? We panic, and then in the end things sort themselves out on their own. Yes, on their own. - No Talking to the Driver - You shouldn't take that literally. The last driver probably swiped it from a bus for a laugh. - Attack Dog- - Please Wipe Your Feet - - 3rd Floor - - Kitchen - - Please Flush after Using - - Keep Out: Extreme Danger - - Unclean Water - Must be a collector. He unscrews everything. Some people are like that. Smoke? No. Be a dear and light one for me. Here, take it quickly. Smoke makes you queasy now? - Some candy? - No. - What's the matter? Don't you feel well? - It's nothing. After 200 kms, it's hard to keep the conversation going, but... do you realize we'll soon be living together? You don't look too happy about it. Jean, stop! Please. What's the matter? Not feeling well? I shouldn't have come along in this state. What do you mean? Look at me. - Tell me you didn't do anything foolish. - What could I do? You're telling me just now? Can you hang on for another 300 kms? - What? - Roll down the window. I shouldn't. You'll catch cold. Roll down the window! Turn the lights on. I don't want to be in the dark. Turn the lights off. We're almost there. Emile's place is only 50 kms away. Warning: Construction 300m ahead. Traffic Rerouted. Road Blocked. DETOUR I'm sorry but I can't go any further. I can't see a thing. I think I went the wrong way. Say, Clo... What is it? I'm sorry to bother you at this hour. Would you happen to have a phone? I have someone very sick in my truck. And with the fog, I can't go further. I don't have a phone. You'll find one about 1 km the other way. Tell me... Your passenger, what's wrong with him? It's a woman. And she's very sick. Come in. I do have a phone. Thanks. I had to be careful at this hour. - You want a slug of liquor? - No, thanks. Listen, Emile, you need to send me an ambulance immediately. Yes. I'm on Highway 10... after the detour in... - What's the name of this place? - La Croix de Brillac. In La Croix de Brillac. Yes. You have to hurry. Thanks. - What do I owe you? - It's OK. Don't worry. Sorry again for disturbing you. If you'd like to give her a slug of booze, don't hesitate to ask. - Thanks, I'd better not. Bye. - Bye. All set. I spoke to Marchandot. An ambulance is coming. Keep the covers on. Don't go! Don't worry. I'm staying right here. Where are you? I want to see you. Don't leave me alone. I'm staying, I promise. Be reasonable. Rest a bit. I can't. It hurts too much. There's nothing I can do. We have to wait. Where the hell were you? You sure took your time. We've been trying to get here. Maybe you noticed the fog? We had as much fog to deal with as you. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. It's been an hour and a half. Wake up! I didn't call you. I called the cops. They at least speak French. My maid... Kidnapped! American officer go home... - Americans go home? - Not you! My maid. Go home, Officer, Studebaker, Buick... I don't know. It's a great American car! I guess I might as well write her off. Good Lord! Now I don't even have a maid to trade in for a new one. Oh well, there are exceptions... Here, Emile. Bye. See you around. Thanks. So, as I was saying... Try to make just a little effort to understand. - Hi, Viart. Doing OK? - Fine, thanks. - Hi, Pierrot. How are you? - What about you? Hanging in there. - And the family? - Loulou has whooping cough. Jacqueline still wants to be a star. - Still? - Yeah, but it's taking a while. And Solange? She's like me. Not getting any younger. And you? Your rig still holding up? It's holding. OK. See you soon, Pierrot. See you soon.
