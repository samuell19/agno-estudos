My mother once told me that life is a compilation of choices we've made. Every day we have to make choices. From simple choices like "what are we going to eat?" "What are we going to wear?" "Which fake eyelashes are we going to put on?" "How many inches of high heels are we going to wear?" To greater choices like "when do you want to get married?" "How many children are you planning to have?" It should have been me. It should have been me too. Eww! Not that one. She's a hustler. Douchebag. Douchebag. A-hole. Playboy. Douchebag. Loser. And I've reached that point in my life. That crucial point in my life where I have to make... ...the biggest decision of my life. Decision for my future, my life, and my dignity. Although there's no guarantee that it would make me happy. But I can not afford to lose hope! And today will be the highlight of my life. The day I finally take control of my life and my destiny. The day that marks a new era! A new chapter! The day that I will find my true love! The love of my life! The father of my children! My future caucasian (Bule) husband! Mimin is going to the market! Pipin, Mimin! Pipin, Mimin! Pipin, Mimin! Hi, girls! Let me introduce you to my boyfriend. This is Andrew. Andrew, these are... ...the girls. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi, I'm Sha. - Hi, I'm Andrew. - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you, too. Are those your friends? I would not call them friends. They're hustlers, you know? And I'm not. I see. Hey! What are you doing kissing my boyfriend?! Boyfriend, huh? You've never even slept with him. But we've already kissed! And I'm not cheap like you, sleeping together on the first date! Come on, Pipin. You and I have no commitment whatsoever. - Let's go, baby. - I've got to go, Pipin. I kind of need... ...sex, you know? No! You can't treat me like shit! Take me home! What's up, Mak? Mak! What? What happened? Mak, my Bule. My Bule... A slut stole my Bule! Which Bule? Andrew... The one you met on "Tinder" or "Minder"? "Minder", Mak... What did I tell you, huh? Don't look for boyfriend at "Minder"! It's full of horny men with one thing in their mind, sex! I'm so upset, Mak!! I've told you, you'd better move here to Bali with me. You can get a better chance finding Bule here. Go home now! Do not disgrace our country! Maak! Welcome to Bali! Geee... still with your erect fake eylashes, huh? These are my charms! So, it's a new day It's a new life! And I'm feeling good, Mak! I can't believe I finally am moving to Bali! It's about time. I've been telling you to move here since last year. The competition in Jakarta is getting fierce. Those hustlers are getting younger, prettier, and sexier. While you're getting older and saggy. Watch your mouth! I'm not a hustler! I'm sorry, but one look at you, people would think that you are. Besides, I told you there's no way you'll get a Bule husband at Club 69! All you'll ever get is nasty competition with hustlers. I know, right! And all the Bule there doesn't want to marry me either. They just want sex. And you still stick to your celibacy rule... Saving your cherry for your husband... No Bule wants that! And meanwhile, your cherry starts to... - Ripen! - It's so ripe, it's rotting. Damn you! Seriously, please help me find my true love in Bali, okay? I left so many things in Jakarta. I left my mother, my job... All right. And you're 29 now, right? You're already such pain in the ass in your 20s. I can't imagine when you're in your 30s. Yes, I'll be 30 next year. My deadline to get married. I want to have children too, you know. Then stop complicating your own life. Don't be too picky. If he's compatible enough with you, kind, financially stable... ...then he's the one. Remember, don't let your cherry rot! You're so annoying. And you have to follow my strategies. You have to obey me. No more Bule hunting in clubs! And stop using "Minder" or another dating app like that! Period! Yes, my dear Arik, Sir! One more thing, I have to look for job here too. My savings is only enough to support myself for six months. You don't want me to keep staying with you, right? - Kak? - What! Where are you? Is your friend already with you? I'm driving. Talk later. Was that your boyfriend? Ew, he's just a clingy twink. Keeps calling me "kak" (older brother). Introduce us! - Who is he? - Just a local boy. We only had one date, and now he's crazy for me. Maybe he falls in love with you. And what's with that fake manly voice? - What?! I am manly! - You're kidding, right? I can't believe you. What's wrong with this one? Well... He's soooo not my type. Just like his name, Bias. He's so biased, annoying and too sissy. But all your exes are annoying! Are you afraid that this one is going to steal your spotlight? - Damn you. Drop it! - All right. How's your guest house business going? Good? Of course! My father wants me to build a new one in Nusa Dua. That's awesome. So, where are we going tonight? You'll see. I have a candidate for you. Are you serious? Come here. Thank you. Look what you did! You ruined my expensive BB cream. Here, let me clean it for you. Just keep driving. I'll clean it. Timo is not the only boy in the world. I know, Mom. And as a girl, you have to be smart. Only one bee should be allowed to suck your nectar. - Ew, gross, mom. - And that bee should be... My husband. I know. I'm not a fool, you know? But women tend to act foolishly when they're in love. - So, were you like that too? - I was very smart then. And I don't want my only daughter to be fooled by men. - Did you 'do it' only with daddy? - Of course! Look at your father. Such an outstanding gentleman. So handsome, strong, such gentleman, and a responsible man. I'm so proud that he was the only bee who ever sucked... Eww! Stop it, Mom! Done. Oh, my God, Mom! I look so different! Oh, my God! Gorgeous! - Hello, gorgeous. - Aw, thank you. Sorry. I meant him. - Do you want to hang out later? - No, but thank you. Okay, whatever. Happy? He's horny for you. Ah, I don't do backpackers, and I don't like Bule. - But he looks so masculine. - Nope. Gurl, are you eating nachos or chewing grass? You make mess on your mouth. Eat like a lady! You'd better clean your mouth. What's that? Let me see your handbag. - No! - It's so tacky. - I don't care. - Is it a fake designer handbag? It's cute! I like the bling bling color. - Is it fake? - Okay. I don't want to waste my money on original designer handbags. They're too expensive for me. Nobody'll notice the difference anyway. - Well, I did! - You're a queer! I'd rather you wear a cheap handbag than wearing a fake designer bag. Beautiful only on the outside, but ugly on the inside! - You're fooling yourself. - But this is a good quality fake. I don't care if it's a good quality or even a super quality fake. Fake is fake! I'd rather see you carry a plastic grocery bag. I'm getting you one. Let me ask the waiter. Stop it! Where's the Bule that you want to introduce to me? Bule! Bule! He's almost here. What's with your Bule infatuations? Leave me alone. Bule is cool. There are many cool local men too. Like me. Local men are so uncool. They're fake, shallow, and unromantic. They want a wife with a housemaid criteria. - I think you already look like one. - Damn you! Local men are too demanding. Besides, I know they think I'm too ugly for them. But for Bule, I am exotic. Oh, please. - Hello, guys. - Hi, Ben, how are you? - Sorry, I'm late. - Hi, Ben. I'm good. This is my friend Pipin. Pin, this is Ben. Hi, Ben. I'm Pipin. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Pipin. It's been a long... Ben is from Melbourne, Australia. And he owns this place... ...among many other businesses he owns. Well, it's not all mine. - And he's so modest. - Just telling the truth. You look familiar. You remind me of someone. Whoo? Stop acting like you know all Bule. Nevermind. Hang on a second, I'll be back. Is that a real Bule? Half. - But I told you... - Shut up. He's coming back. - Sorry. Actually, I need you to... - Oh, yeah, sure. - Excuse us. - Okay. - He's a half-half! - Where're you going? She's only interested in Bule. You can pretend to be half Bule first. Once she falls in love with you, you can tell her the truth. Exactly. I don't like pretending. And I look... stupid! I look nothing like Bule. Half! Half Bule. And I think you look like one. You look like Donald Trump. And I swear to God this wig is itchy. Just hang on for a while. Why would I go with your silly plan anyway? Just hang on a little longer. Ah, the traffic city. - Yeah, you know... - So you come to Bali now? Bali is good. - Guys, this is Gior... Giordano! - Gianfranco Battaglia. - Yeah, that. - Gianfranco Battaglia. Please, sit. - So, Pipin... - Yes? - I think I'd better go now. - Okay. Don't forget to call me later. See you, beautiful. Bye! Bye! - Sorry, guys. - Oh my God, what a trash! So tacky! You're not going to call him, right? I don't know. But it's okay to just be friends, right? - No! - Ouch! Maak! I'm so sorry. But he just came here and introduced himself to me. - No worries. - Thank you. Make new friends is ok anyway, right? Besides, this is a new place for me. Yeah. Sure. Slut! Thank you. Faggot! You... - You're so stubborn. - Slut. - Let's eat. I'm starving. - Okay, let's do. - Do you want to order something more? - Yeah. Can we order chicken, please? Sit. Timo! What are you doing? Shut up! You know that you're lucky to be my girlfriend! You bitch! You should be grateful, you ugly bitch! I might be ugly, but your dick is the size of a chalk! - And your breath smells like sewer! - Slut! I'll report you to your teachers, to your priests, and to your parents! You messed with the wrong girl! Pin? - Pin? - Oh, Buyung... Wh-why are you wa-walking alone this late? Buyung... You're the last man on earth who still carry a handkerchief. Why are you laughing at a sad girl? I-I'm sorry. Th-there's some-something... Oh, my God. I-I-I'll give you a ride home? But-but on-only if you wa-want to. Ready? Pin? You really don't recognize... - Your hot tea. - Thank you. - Buyung? - Hi. - Hey, Donna. - What's up? Good. This is Pipin. This is Donna, my business partner, and also my cousin. - Buyung? - So, this is Pipin. - Nice to meet you, Pipin. - Nice to meet you, too. I have to go. I need to check up the kitchen's fan. Bye. - Buyung? Are you Buyung? - I've been meaning to tell you... Buyung?! But you really didn't recognize me? Your skin? I did a pigment therapy treatment in Australia. Your hair? Sorry, it's just a wig. Oh, my God. Are you really Buyung? Oh, my God. Wait. How about your stutter? It's gone. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You really are Buyung! It crossed my mind yesterday, and apparently... Wait. Why did you pretend to be a Bule yesterday? It was a silly plan, really. I bet it was Arik's idea! You boys! Oh my God. Seriously! But you've really changed. You're handsome now. So, is this your first visit home since you moved to Melbourne? I came home a few times on family occasions, never long. But how come I've never stumbled upon you on Facebook... ...or other social media? - I'm not using any social media. - Don't you have Internet in Australia? And using the name Ben... Actually, Ben is my first name, remember? - In Melbourne, people know me as Ben. - I see! Benyamin! - It's Benjamin. - Yeah! That! Oh, my God. I was quite excited when Arik told me that you half-Bule. And I bought that. I almost fell for you! - Hey, faggot! - Don't call me faggot! Bye, love! Are you sure you didn't leave your bra or something? That's how local men are. They're hypocrite. I'm local, I'm not a hypocrite. - Hey, you tricked me! - What? Buyung! You introduced him as half-Bule. Did he confess to you? I found out when his beautiful cousin, what's her name again? Donna? Yeah. She called him Buyung. That's when I found out. It doesn't matter if he's Bule, half Bule or local. You like him. When I thought he was half Bule... ...I thought maybe I could still try. But now, I don't know. What do you mean "you don't know"? Let me ask you something. Is he kind to you? - Yes. - Is he financially stable? - Yes. - Is he a gentleman? - Yes. - Is he good looking? - Yes. - So? He's not a Bule! He's not even half-Bule! I can't believe you! But Buyung... I know he's kind, good looking, financially stable, and a gentleman. But I like Bule. - My dream is to marry a Bule. - But that's just a skin deep. Just pretend that he's an overly tanned Bule. What? Let me tell you something. Do you remember when we talked about my fake handbag? My feelings for Buyung is just like your feeling about my fake handbag. Buyung is like a good quality of fake designer handbag. Even if he's super quality, still, he is not the original. Are you comparing Buyung with your fake handbag? You are crazy! Let me explain it to you. You don't like Bule, right? What if I force you to date a Bule right now? I would date him if he looks like a Javanese! Oh, come on! I want my offsprings to be better looking too. You can't force my ideal type of boyfriend. That's exactly what we need to investigate. I don't understand your racist taste for boyfriend. You know what? I know what it is. - What? - It's white supremacy! I sometimes wonder if our country is still mentally enslaved. We always look up to Bule. Proud to hang out with Bule. As if their social status can be upgraded if they hang out with Bule. Just like you. Hey, all your local ex boyfriend are no better. They're all hypocrite. My case is different than yours. In my case, the society is the hypocrite, judgmental. There, you've said it yourself. Our society is the hypocrite and judgmental. Including the males. They think women should always obey them. We should take care of children, clean the house, bla bla bla... Whatever. I want gender equality. And only Bule can respect that. You? Talk about gender equality? Do you want to support your family, be the head of the family? Do you want to protect your partner if you're walking on the streets with him? Do you want to drive your partner around? - It's a gentleman's fate! - Gentleman's fate? Women like you are so confused. You want gender equality. While at the same time you talk about "gentleman's fate". Women like you demand equal rights. Yet you still want to enjoy the benefits of being a female. Hello, gender equality? If you want to be treated as equal, you have to be fair. Equal responsibility and equal rights. That's the typical local men. Like you for example. You want a masculine partner. You don't care if they treated you like trash, as long as they're masculine. But when you've found a slightly feminin partner... ...you treated them the way you've been treated, like trash. Straight or gay, men are all the same. Hello! No wonder if all straight men became gay if all women were like you! Yes, Gianfranco? Yes, I remember your name now. Oh, yeah, sorry about today. Tomorrow? In front of Uma Seminyak? Okay, 1 p.m., yes? Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye. Hi, sexy. Hey, sexy. - You're late! - Sorry, baby, I'm busy. I've been working. You look beautiful, by the way. - Do you want to have coffee or food? - Food? I'm hungry right now. Let's have a lunch. Okay. What kind of food? Oh, God, they have the best Italian food here. Ladies first. - So, how was your date last night? - Okay. Pipin is your childhood friend, right? - Are you okay, champ? - Yeah. - Spill it out. - What? Come on, I know you too well, dude. You have something on your mind. Well... I like Pipin. She's special. - But the feeling is not mutual. - Really? The girl knows exactly what she wants. Bule. I think it's shallow to like or dislike someone based on their skin, right? The thing is, I don't think she's shallow at all. She has the right to have an ideal type for her boyfriend. You know what? Just be friends with her. Get to know each other better. - You'll never know. - Yeah, that's the plan. Thank you. Let me, babe. Oh, shit. Darling, I forgot my wallet. I'm so sorry, I was in a hurry to meet you. I forgot to bring my money. Can you pay this? You have money, right? - You pay this, and I'll pay you later. - Yes. It's okay, darling. I'll pay you later. - I'll pay you back. - Okay. Sorry, I forgot. The waitress is waiting. It's okay. Just give them all. - But I... - We can tip them also. Yeah, that should be enough, baby. Come, let's go. I'll take you to see my villas. - Take your bag. Come. - Okay. - Come on, baby. - Yes. - Welcome to my villa. - Is this yours? Yes, one of my seven villas. I live here temporarily till I find a tennant. How nice! All I need is a woman to be the queen of my palace. Let's make love. Wait. I don't do make love. What do you mean you don't do make love? I don't... Besides, this is our first date. I like it. You're classy. - I like my woman to be classy. - I don't... - One second. - Okay. - Excuse me a second. - Okay. Hello? Hello, yes? I can't hear you. Hello? I can't hear you. The signal is bad. Baby, I'm sorry. I forgot. I have meeting with my business partner in 10 minutes. She... He is coming. So can you go home with a taxi? - We'll meet tomorrow, okay? - Yes. Please forgive me, okay? - Tomorrow? - Yeah. Take care. - Okay. - Bye. Gianfranco... Too bad he has a meeting. He? She? I'm in love, Mak! Gianfranco is a husband material. He's good looking, hot, rich, romantic... - Whatever. - Be happy for me, will you? You'll like him once you know him. How's work, mak? I have to go to Nusa Dua for a couple of days tomorrow. Don't bring your boyfriend here, okay? Never. Gianfranco has a huge villa. - He has a huge what? - Villa! - Just a villa? - I'd rather spend time with him there. Wait until he asks you for sex. Remember, he's a Bule and an Italian. But I told him about my "no sex before married" rule. And he seemed okay with that. So, it was a perfect date. But there was an awkward moment when he forgot to bring his purse. Wallet! Yeah, that. - So, did you pay the bill then? - I did. But that's okay. It was worth it. It's called gender equality. Gender equality ala Mimin. There, I typed it. You're a crazy weirdo! Baby, I'm hungry. Okay, let's go get some food. I know the best restaurant in Bali. I'll take you there. - Nice restaurant? - Yes, the best food. Come. Best food? This is the best food in Bali. Dig in! Is this even clean? Don't be a snob. If it's good for me it is good for you. Hi, Buyung. Yes, why? I don't think I can tonight. How about tomorrow? Okay. See you, Buyung. - Who was it? - My friend. You're not seeing another guy, right? No. This is my childhood friend. I will be very, very mad if you're seeing another man. I want my girl to be classy. No, Gianfranco. We're just friends. - Don't play with my heart. - I'm not. Now, that's my girl. Dig in. Hello, Gianfranco. Yes? I need your help. Can you come here? But I have an appointment today. You're my girl, right? I need your help. You love me, right? - Are you okay? - No, I'm not. Okay, I'll be there. You called me for this? Baby, please. Don't make me beg. I'm a man. I'm not good in doing domestic stuff. I need my baby to help me. You don't have a housemaid? Baby, they're all lazy. Indonesian people are lazy. I don't want to spend money for lazy people. Hey, do not insult my people. Darling, if you'll be my wife, this is a good practise, right? Okay, I will help you. Why don't you help me around in doing my business? What? By being a cleaning lady? Yes, I need a help with the Indonesians here. To speak their language. They can be very tricky to Bule. You know, do the business. And then I'll get paid, right? I'll pay you with love, baby. No, of course. If you help me do my business, I will pay you. Okay. - A handshake? - Let's do the lipshake, baby. Deal, a handshake. Yes. Good. Quick. Now you can start. - Are you done, Baby? - Yes. Thank you, my love. Baby, I forgot. My client is coming in 10 minutes. She is coming in 10 minutes, so you'd better go. Yeah, my client. She's coming in 10 minutes. Come on. She? He is coming in 10 minutes. Can you take a taxi? I'll call you tonight after I finished. Thank you for the work. You have money, yes? - Yes. But, why I can't... - All right, just take a taxi. No problem, baby. I'll call you tonight after I finished. - But I... - Love you. Bye. But, Gianfranco, I... Hello, Buyung? Are you at the restaurant? Ever since that day, everybody keeps calling me Mimin. It's ironic because Topeng Monyet (Monkey Show) is already banned in here. - Really? - They said it's inhumane. - But monkeys are not human, right? - Maybe they think it's animal abuse. Exactly. But I thank God. Because eventually people stopped calling me Mimin. Except your friend, that faggot. - Kids can be silly. - Yes. I don't think you deserve to be called Mimin. They can call me Mimin or Pipin, whatever. The important thing is I'm beautiful and I know it. Yeah! My friends used to call me Zebra, because my skin was... Yeah. I don't think that you deserve to be called zebra either. How is your mother? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just not many men asked me about my mother. My mom's fine. She protested a bit when I told her I was going to move here. But she's ok now. - Thanks for asking. - Don't mention it. Yung, I'm so happy we meet again. Me too. Oh, Arik said you're looking for a job? Yes, I was. But Gianfranco offered me a job in his villa. Gianfranco? The Italian guy you met that night? Yeah. You meet him often? He's kind of my boyfriend now. - Where were you last night? - My phone's battery ran out. No! You didn't pick it up. You said you would call me last night. - I was waiting! - Baby, I fell asleep. So which one is it? Your battery ran out or you fell asleep? Details! I call you to take you out! You give me a headache. Do you want to go out or not? Okay... Yeah, I'll come later. - Oh shit! - What happen? - Hold on. - Yeah, okay. - What happen? - Get off the bike. - Off! Off the bike, now. - Off? I forgot to fill the gas. The tank is empty. - Push the bike. - What? Push! Push the bike! We're hungry. We eat first. Get some food, and fill the gas later. Push! Quick! - I'm pushing. - Push harder. Quick! This is so embarrassing. Do you have money for the gas? Give me money for the gas. I saw it, you still have some left. - This is all I have left. - Okay. I'll be back soon. - Be quick. - I'll be back. Why are you dating a poor Bule, Miss? What? You're not still mad at me, right? You should not forget things again. Yeah, but I'm only human. Look, baby. This is a test for our relationship. Through the good times, and the bad times. - I'm sweaty. - I don't mind. You're sexy. See? When you smile you're not even half ugly. - Wait. What did you say? - What did I say? - What? - What the hell! Shit. Gianfranco Battaglia! How many times do I have to tell you not to bring girls here? I'm sorry. I can explain. A girl? This is an old woman! This is a hooker! I'm sorry. I don't... I'm sorry. Excuse me! Excuse me! Who are you guys? Oh, Pipin. Not now. What are you doing? I'm the owner of this place. I have this place. - He's just a servant here. - Gianfranco, is that true? - Yeah... - Get out, you hooker! - I'm not a hooker. - She's not a hooker. - Get out! - I'm not a hooker! Get out! - You'd better leave. - My love, you'd better go now. Your love? - You said I'm your only love. - Yes! You're my only love. - You're cheating on me with him? - Your wife is crazy! - You both are rubbish! - God, please! I'm sorry. Oh my God. You're a crazy lady! Mak... Are you upset? Yeah. I'm tired. My heart is so tired. I don't understand why my boyfriends were all jerks. I can't seem to find a decent man. Really? I don't think so. There's one decent man. But you always make everything more complicated than it should. You mean Buyung? But he's not a Bule. I want to marry a Bule! I'm tired of all of this. It makes me so depressed. Calm down. And be prepared for your fate. Not everybody is meant to get married. But I want to get married. - What's your Plan B, then? - I don't have Plan B. I'm destined to get married. I have to get married. I don't want to think about not getting married. Then you should introspect yourself. What made you want to get married so bad in the first place? Was it about social status? Having kids? Social judgement? Cliche. It's all of them. What do you care? Married or single, people will always find something to judge us. And I think the reasons for people to get married are mostly selfish. Stop being upset. We don't need men to survive. We just need to be focus on our life. Work hard, save lots of money. And when we're old, we can hang with friends, have fun together. I think that's what the best for us. Do we really need a noble reason to get married? Just want to love and to be loved is not good enough? - Hey, adorable Arik. - Hi, bisexual Billy. Looking good tonight. Tell me something I don't know. You sexy devil. May I buy you a drink? - No, thank you. - Okay. Well, do you want to have some fun? Go to my place. Sweat it out. Good try, but no thank you. But, hey, maybe a friend of mine would be interested. Sure. I'm available. Let me introduce you to Pipin. No way! Yo, come on! There's a limit for everything. I'm gone. Faggot Bule! I've been nudging you to save me from that Bule jerk. You should back me up sometimes. Well, he's a Bule. Who knows you might be interested. - Hey, guys. - Hey, you made it. Another Bule. Pin, are you okay? She's drunk. And heart broken. Do you need a ride home? No. No! I want to have fun tonight! Can I have some water? You're so heavy. You should quit eating chocolate! Can you stay with her? I have to go outside for a moment. Water? You... You know what? You're very kind. The kindest Bule I've ever met. Will you marry me? You're not an a-hole, right? Not a crazy Bule, right? You're drunk. What a girl got to do to be loved? At least hug me, will you? Hug me. You smell nice. You know what? I can marry you! Pin? Oh, shit! Jackpot! Ew, jackpot! We have to take her home now. Baby... I do... I do!! Ew! Faggot! That explains my nightmare the whole night. You're mean. Oh, my God. It's 1 o'clock! Quick, we have to meet Buyung at 2 o'clock. Wake up! Don't go back to sleep! I knew that the Bule is going to be a bad news for you. Oh, dear, you are so unlucky in love, aren't you? Rik! - Stop crying, move on. - Thank you. Maybe you need a break from your love quest. Focus on positive things in your life. Let's go to your villa, in Pejeng. Can we? Sure, why not? We should take Donna too. Yay! So, when can we go? Buyung, is your job offer still open? Yeah, sure. When can you start? That's my girl. It's about time you stop thinking about Gianfranco. Okay. Let's take a wefie. Right here. Look pretty! Hurry. Look pretty! That's more like it. If you keep crying, you'll look like this owl. Do you think it's okay to hire the girl that you fall in love with to work for you? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. But she needs it right now. - Does she know? - About what? That you like her? Did you ever tell her? You should contact them. Tell them to come here. You mean today? Sorry. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Where were we? - Thank you. - You're welcome. I have an idea for an event. I already calculated the budget, you can read it later. - Yeah, good! - Really? - Brilliant! - Nice! Thank you! If you want, you can come here for a vacation. Don't worry. Your daughter has a job now, Mom. Thank God if you already have a job. You can pay for my vacation in Bali. Bring it on! Okay. Oh, guys! Come on! Guys! I ask you first, you should answer. - You hit the brakes again. - You suddenly hit the brakes. - Where are Donna and Arik? - They're going out. I see. This place is perfect for wedding. Imagine if we put wedding pillars over there, and decorate it with flowers. It will be perfect for a wedding vow. And we can put chairs over there for the guests. It's going to be beautiful. One day, if you get married, you should have the wedding here. Yeah, one day. - Pin? - Hmm? What? What do you want to say? - Well... - Well what? Do you want coffee? I'll be right back. - Pin? - Hm? I-I like you. I mean... I love you. Say something. Please? I... I don't know what to say. After all this time, you don't know that... I like you, Yung. But not like that. - I care a lot about you. - I know. Yung, sorry. But I can't. Why? Because I'm not a Bule? Even though I'm not a Bule, I'm still the same man... ...that you met on your first night in Bali. I'm also the same man that you kissed at the bar that night. Oh, no. What? Did we... I kissed you? You don't remember? Oh, no. I'm sorry, Yung. I can't... I just can't. I-I'd better leave. You don't have to. Really. Stay. No. It's for the best. Forgive me, Yung. - Excuse me. - Oh, Miss Pipin. - Is Mr. Buyung here? - Yes, he is. He's outside. - Of course. - Thank you! I love you! I love you! I'm so happy! - Can you give this to him? - Sure, Miss. I told you but you didn't listen. Mak! Ouch, Kakak! Yes? What? I'm busy. Why is it so hard to meet you lately? My room is next to your room. I've been busy. Are you avoiding me? Are you mad at me? Yes. I just don't get you. How is Buyung? Why don't you ask him yourself? I have to go inside. Mak, can I pay the next month rent a little bit late? So what's your plan now? I have an interview this afternoon. I hope I get the job. Wish me luck. All right. I have to go inside now. Thank you, mak. Buyung? Surprise! Darling. - What are you doing here? - I'm meeting you here! - No! I have a job interview. - Yes, with me! - No! It's with Mr. Franky. - Franky, Franco. Franco, Franky. - It's me. Gianfranco. - No! - Yes! - No! You're humiliating me. You're a bastard. Baby, I need to tell you something important. Sit. I tried to call you hundreds of time. But you never pick up. And you know exactly why. What do you want? - I want you. - You can't have me. I can. Baby, I'm a changed man. I'm a model now. A professional model. Look. Look at these pictures. I'm a professional model. - Baby, I make a lot of money. - It's not about the money. I know it's not about the money. But, you're a special girl, Pipin. I like you a lot. Please give me a second chance. This is the best time for you to say "yes". - A wedding ring? - Yeah. A wedding ring. Yeah, like that. Please say yes. Two Japanese gay guys are looking at us. This is the best time for you to say yes. What are you doing? - Yes? Yes, right? - Yes...? Yes! Thank you very much. - Congratulations. - Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Are you model agents? I'm a model. Look, I'm a professional model. See? These are my pictures. I'm a very good model, very talented. If you have a job... ...maybe, I don't know Taiwan, Chinese job. I'm all in. I can do them. It's so hot in here. What? Can you be more tidy? Baby, I'm a man. I have trouble being tidy. Besides, we will marry soon. You're my woman now. Will you help me clean? What are you doing? What? My manager told me to upload new photos in my Instagram. - With only underwear? - Yeah, my fans love my sexy photos. I'll get more sexy "likes". Besides, I'm a model now. It's a part of my job. - Baby, come here. - What? Come here. Take my picture. Wait. Okay, I'm ready. Okay, done. Perfect! Baby, I forgot. We ran out of beer. Can you get us some? Give me the money. Baby, I forgot to go to ATM. Use your money first. I'll pay you back later. No problem, okay? Baby, we will marry soon. Your money is my money. My money is my money. - What? - Your money is my money. - My money is your money. - That's not what you said. Baby, you're always angry now. Everything I said makes you unhappy. And whenever you're unhappy, I'm unhappy. What is your problem? The problem is always... - Okay! I'll buy the beer. - Thank you. Go. Hey, friends. This is Gian... Hello? Yes. Of course she said yes. I'm a love god, right? Yeah, as soon as I marry her... ...no more problem with immigration bullshit, right? It's not too hard to find a desperate Indonesian woman to marry. Especially that spinster. Yeah, no problem. Bye. What? Bastard! You're snooping on me now? Is that it? - I left my bag. - Yeah, so? What? I might be desperate. But I would rather be a spinster for next hundred lives... ...than marry a trash like you. Here! Eat your shit! Pipin, you'll regret this! You slut! You'll never find a more handsome man than me! I'm the sexiest man alive for you. You'll get, I don't know, some rotting man! This is very expensive! Hello, Pin? What are you doing? What's wrong? A man broke your heart again? I'm ready to be an old maid, Mom. Is it okay if I never married? Pin, have I ever forced you to get married? Never, right? Married or single, as long as you're happy... ...then I'm happy for you. I'm tired, mom. I'm so tired of finding my true love. I left Jakarta and I left you for nothing. Zero. I don't care if you're single or married. I just don't want you to give up. I'm not forcing you to get married. But I don't want you to stay single just because you're giving up. You should focus on something else, not just pursuing love. You live in Bali now. You can't come home just because a man broke your heart. You can focus on yourself, your friends, your career. And let fate leads you to meet your true love. And who knows? Maybe the man you've been looking for... ...is already right in front of your eyes. If you push your luck, you might lose the one you already got. - Don't you remember anything I said... - Oh, my God. ...about life is just a compilation of choices we make? And I hope you can choose wisely. Make decisions that you won't regret. Hello? Oh, my God. Buyung... You're so right, mom. Oh, my God! Thank you, Mom. I'll call you back. I love you, Mom! - Excuse me. - Miss Pipin. Is Mr. Buyung here? Sorry, he's not here, miss. They haven't been here since yesterday. - Do you know where they are? - I don't know, Miss. Can you help me find a taxi? I have a better idea, Miss. Please pick up, pick up... Please pick up, pick up... Where should I go? Ah! Okay! No! Stop! Stop it! Pin? Excuse me. I'm sorry. But please allow me to say something to him for a moment. Then you can continue. Oh, my God. - Pin? Hey. - Buyung, I've been blind. I've been stupid. I didn't realize that you... You're not a fake designer handbag! You're not. All this time I've been comparing you with a fake designer handbag. Ugh... Sorry. I mean... Buyung, you've always shown your love for me. Since we were little, you care for me a lot. You love me. But all this time I've been blinded by original designer handbag... I mean my stupidity! I didn't realize that not only you are the kindest man I've ever met. But you're also the one that I've been looking. My true love. Sometimes, we didn't realize that what we're looking for... ...is right there in front of our eyes the whole time. My mother said that to me, and she's right. Buyung… I know this might be too late. But I... I think at least you deserve to know that... That I love you. That... that you're... No, you're not a fake designer handbag. You're an original and a limited edition designer handbag. That's all I want to say. Buyung? But... Why are you here? Do you mean everything you said? But I guess it doesn't matter anymore. It does. Stop! Mimin, I have to admit. You amazed me. Your speech...? Ugh, love it! Love it! That was the best thing that ever came out of your mouth, girl. Thank you. Your speech was so sweet. It made me cry. Gosh, it's such a perfect day.
