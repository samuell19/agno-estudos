(♪ The Blue Danube) Come on, 100! Scott won most of the trophies in this room. You see, that's the tragedy. My son was a champion. Welcome to the Southern Districts Waratah championships! You're gonna see some of the top dancers in the Southern Districts here today. Well, there'd been some silliness in the past but we thought he was over it. I mean, we never imagined that he would do such a thing in front of... Federation president Barry Fife! And don't forget, the official federation video, yes, the only way to dance... Wonderful to see you, Barry. Barry Fife's Dance To Win is on sale here tonight! Yeah. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that Scott and Liz would be the next Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Five-Dance Latin American champions. I mean, they'd worked towards it all their lives. And then... came that. Samba! - (♪ Samba version of Tequila) - (Cheering) Come on! Come on, Kenny! Come on, 54! Come on, 69! Ken Railings and Pam Short were dancing there that night. Come on, Kenny boy! Oh! Ken's always been a wonderful ambassador for ballroom dancing. ♪ Tequila ♪ But I know that everyone there really thought it was Scott's turn. Come on, number 100! It is true. Scott and Liz became what we term boxed in, or blocked. Piss off! It was no excuse for what Scott did. What the bloody hell's going on, Kendall? He resorted to his own flashy, crowd-pleasing steps. Come on, come on. He forced me into it. Where the man goes, the lady must follow. I had no choice. I bet you never saw that before. I keep asking myself why. Did I do something wrong? Did I fail him as a mother? In front of Barry Fife. - I'll cut the music. - Don't be bloody stupid, woman! Yeah! Well, to pick what was actually wrong with the steps, you'd have to be an experienced professional like myself or federation president Barry Fife. Barry Fife. Well, of course, you can dance any steps you like. That doesn't mean you'll... win. The winner is couple number 69... - (Ken) Yeah! Yes! - Ken Railings and Pam Short. Ken and Pam are Southern Star Inter-Regional New Vogue title holders, Putting On The Ritz City And Country Inaugural Three-Dance Round-Robin champions, Tulip Time Central Districts And Outlying Regions Winter Five-Dance two-time champions and former three times Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Five-Dance Latin American champions! Yes! I've only been dancing for two years so I haven't got a partner yet but I thought that what they danced was wonderful. I thought they should have won. Hi, Liz, I thought you should have... Come all the way down from the Big Smoke. - Sorry. - Liz! - Liz. - Piss off! Get away from me. I'm not dancing with you, all right? I'm not dancing with you till you dance like you're supposed to. (♪ Jack Hylton: Happy Feet) - (Les) That's good. - ♪ Happy feet ♪ I've got those happy feet... Keep away from the chest, girls. One, two, three... One, two, three, four. Partner up. ♪ I've got those ten little tapping toes... ♪ Happy as Larry they were last night, they were on the phone for hours. I'm just asking you. What did you think of the steps? I don't think! I don't give a shit about them! We lost! Don't you worry about Barry. Spinning the girl off! Oh, Fran, are you out of that apricot scrub? - Nearly, Mrs Hastings. - I'll bring some in tomorrow with the toner. - It's a dollar dazzler special this week. - Thanks, Mrs Hastings. Grand roulé in! I don't want us to end up like that drunk, Ken Railings. Ken Railings is a ballroom king! Good, Clarry! I'll smooth it over. When Les Kendall talks, Barry Fife listens. I've got my happy face on today, Les. Everything's going to be all right. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Mrs Hastings. I am sorry. I have tried. God knows, I have tried. But as far as I can see, your son isn't even interested in winning at the Pan-Pacifics. As of this moment, he and I are no longer partners. - Hi, Liz. - Whoa! Vanessa! - Tango, please. - (Liz) Oh, Vanessa! Come on. This stupid studio's a nightmare! - Oh, my God, Shirley. - Stay calm, Les. Stay calm. Here he comes. (Shirley) Doug. Doug. Son, can I bend your ear for a tick? Not now, Dad. Don't you speak to your father like that! He's trying to talk to you. Talk to him, Doug. Scottie, are we going to do that bogo pogo? Did you like the way I danced on the weekend? - What? - Did you like the way I danced? - I don't know. You didn't win, did ya? - Yeah, but did you like it? - I don't know. You ready? - What? You were gonna help me and Vanessa with the bogo pogo. I'm asking you what you thought of the way I danced on the weekend. I told you. I don't know. Jesus, Wayne. Mm-mm! We had an agreement. Arms, Clarry! Maybe I changed my mind. Maybe I'm just sick of dancing - somebody else's steps all the time. - Don't you get above yourself, lad. People who have passed on those steps know more about dancing than you do! - The audience didn't think so. - Oh, the audience, the audience. Forward on the heel, Fran! What would they know? Flashy, unusual choreography. Crowd pleasing, sure, but where was your floor craft? Arms, Clarry! No energy directed into the floor. Untidy feet and hands. You could've driven a truck between your left elbow... Arms, Clarry! ..and your right hand. Think that's gonna win you the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix? Does he really think that's gonna win him the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix? He also said that what we dance is crap. - What? - Yeah, and then... he ripped her dress. And what's more, you won't win if you don't have a partner. Looks like Scott and Liz are still fighting, Mrs H. I'm not going to let that bother me, Clarry. I've got my happy face on today. Well, Fran, you managed to upset Lizzy. I better go and apologise. Go to that little girl and beg forgiveness. You're nothing without her, Scott. Remember, it takes two to tango. You've a light in you, boy. Let it shine. Hi, Liz. No. All right. I knew you'd come to your senses. No! I don't want this! I don't want this! - What do you want? - What do I want? I'll tell you what I want. I want Ken Railings to walk in here right now and say, "Pam Short's broken both her legs "and I want to dance with you!" Pam Short's broken both her legs and I want to dance with you. That was unexpected. (Les) Thank you very much, class. That's it. Time to go. Chairs, please, Clarry. Broom, Natalie. (Liz) Ken's got his own spa bath. (Ken) Yeah. Great for the aching muscles. I can do you a fantastic deal. (Clarry) Oh, maybe. That'd be great, Mr Railings. Clarry, chairs. Ken owns Spa-Arama. Wayne and I are hoping to do really well this year. - Oh, yeah? Great. - Fran! Cups, love! Hey, Wayne, come over here and meet Ken. Kylie, feed the fish! Doug, are you coming? - He's my partner. - Fiancé. G'day. Doug! Doug! Doug? Doug! Doug, will you hurry up, please? Doug? There, there, there, there. Where's that happy face, huh? There, there. Let's go. Come on, Wayne. Don't worry. We're not going to give up yet. We'll find Scott a new partner. Oh, Lessie, he's my only son. I know, I know, I know. Don't worry, love, don't worry. We'll start try-outs tomorrow, hmm? Now, here's Doug. He'll take you home. Come on, Shirley. (Luke) Good night, fishes! Good night, Uncle Les. - Good night. Night-night. - Good night. Sleep tight. Off we go, off we go, huh? Good. Huh? Happy face. Huh? Ah! Scottie, l... Scott. You're still our number one. And we've got three weeks. We'll start try-outs tomorrow. We'll find you a new partner. Yeah. Bullshit. (Les) Well, to pick what was actually wrong you'd have to be an experienced professional like myself. - That's looking good. - What are you doing here? Oh, I just... - How long have you been here? - Two years. Er, I was just looking for someone. - Everyone's gone home. - Yeah, I know. It's just I've got this idea. Like, I mean, it's, erm... It's... I...want to try to... I want to dance with you. - What? - I want to dance with you. I want to dance with you, your way, at the Pan-Pacifics. The Pan-Pacifics? You want to dance my way at the Pan-Pacifics? Yeah. You can't dance my way - you don't win. It's just because you've been overdoing it. If you... If you kept it simpler and danced from the heart... - What? - And had the right partner. Oh, I see. That's you, is it? When you dance your steps, I understand how you feel - because I make up my own steps too. - You make up your own steps? Yeah, and now we both haven't got partners. Look, what are you carrying on about? You've never had a partner. You've been dancing with a girl for two years, haven't you? - Yeah, but... - Yeah. And now you've come up to me who's been dancing since I was six years old and you say you want to dance non-federation and convince the judges at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix with three weeks to train? Yeah. I don't think so. - Just give me a try-out. Just one hour. - Look, go home. - This is very embarrassing. - I just need a chance. You're going to wake up tomorrow and feel like a real idiot about this. Do you want to dance your own steps or not? It's none of your business. Well, do you? Look, a beginner has no right to approach an open amateur. Yeah, well, an open amateur has no right to dance non-federation steps, - but you did, didn't you? - That's different. How is it different? You're just like the rest of them. You think you're different, but you're not because you're just really scared. You're scared to give someone new a go because they might just be better than you are. Well, you're just pathetic, and you're gutless. You're a gutless wonder! Vivir con miedo es como vivir a medias! What's your name again? Fran. Yeah, Fran what? Just Fran. All right, then, just Fran, don't push me. Rumba. Oh, great. You can't even do a basic. - You said one hour. - One, two, three, four. One, two. One hold two. One hold two, three. One, two, three. Two, three, four. One, two, three... We're telling a story. The rumba's the dance of love. Look at me like you're in love. That's it. Good. Turn, two, three, four. And one, two, three, four. Good, that's it. We're gonna do one basic into a spin then into a lunge, OK? Right. And one, two, and one, turn, and... Oh. One, turn, and lunge. OK. And lunge. Drag, pull, drag. One, turn, there. - I know... - Wait, wait. No, no. We'll go... one and two and three... - Hey, we could... - Wait. Where did that come from? It's a step that I've been working on at home. Show me. Well... She's got no body flight. Good. Stronger. A bit of musicality, please! Good. Good, yeah. Come back in, but not too far. She's terrible. (Shirley) They're either too tall, they're too short, they're too tubby. Well, you know, fat. It's as if he doesn't want to find anyone who's compatible. Now this one's Island Fantasy, and that's 11 .95. Oh, see, that's you. He was supposed to help me and Vanessa with our bogo pogo step. Never even showed up. With a guy like Scott it could be anything - sexuality, drugs, you know. He's obviously lost it, sweetie. He's all washed up. - No! - Sorry. Take a break. How are the try-outs going? - Good. Really good. - Mm. Your mum and Les were really great dancers, weren't they? Yeah, they were. They don't talk about it very much. No. Because of Dad. Look, Fran... The roof. - What's he doing? - He's always hiding away doing something. Can you dance without those? It might help. Come on, we've got work to do.

It was Scott's year, Luke, and now he's gone and thrown it all away. - You wouldn't do that, would you, Lukey? - No. Les will find a partner. There's no time, Doug! She'd have to be a champion. You think someone like Tina Sparkle is wandering around going, "I wonder who I'll dance with?" Why don't you and Mrs Hastings go in the over-35s, Mr Hastings? - I don't like competition. - Dad doesn't go into competitions. But you should have a go, Mr Hastings.

Cos I didn't... Are you all right? - Erm, you better go. I'll see you tomorrow. - OK. The State Championships featuring the magical Mr Nathan Starkey and Miss Tina Sparkle. (Barry Fife) I want Tina to be Scott's new partner, Les. Tina Sparkle? That's right, Les. Bloody Nathan is going to announce his retirement tonight. Scott and Tina are both without partners. I think it would be advantageous for all concerned if they were seen together. Scott's shenanigans have been causing a lot of distracting chat down our way. That's why it's important that Scott is seen dancing the right steps with the right partner. Dance sport needs good young couples, Merv. Terry's hit the nail on the head, Merv. Let's not start chucking the babies out with the bathtub. I'm 100% behind it, Barry. Francisca! Well, gentlemen, let's make this a bloody good festival. Oh, er, Les, just a tick. This is wonderful, Barry, it's wonderful. He doesn't deserve her, Les. I've been fielding phone calls all week about the steps Scott danced at the festival. Oh, Scott's learned his lesson, Barry. He's changed. We both know where that young man was heading, don't we? Foolish boy. But Scott's got his second chance. Let's not forget, Les, that a Pan-Pacific champion becomes a hero, a guiding light to all dancers, someone who'll set the right example. (♪ Waltzing Matilda playing) - You've been drinking. - Bullshit. Bullshit! You bloody have! I love dancing, Les, and I'm not going to let what we've fought for all these years be destroyed. - Come on, 71! - Oh, look at that. - Go, 71! Go, 71! - Come on, 71! - You're drunk, aren't ya? You bloody are. - Bullshit. Bullshit. - 69! - Come on! Get your head up! - Come on, Kenny! - Come on, 54! Go for it, 69, Kenny, you old bum! Do you two know anything about this girl Scott's trying out with? - Who is it, Mum? - Oh, goodness. I'd be the last one to know. Scott says we'll never guess. Hey, Clarry, you haven't seen Fran, have you? No. Maybe she got a lift with Natalie. It's our first big comp tonight. Les, do you know anything about this girl? Jesus, news travels fast around this place. - Who is it, Uncle Les? - Oh, you silly sourpusses. Look at this! "Three times Pan-Pacific champion Tina Sparkle is hunting for a new partner. "It was announced today her partner of ten years Nathan Starkey "will be retiring because of commitments to his landscape gardening business. "Their farewell exhibition will be this weekend's State finals. "The question on every dance fan's lips is who will snaffle Tina." Scott Hastings, that's who. - Oh, my God. - Yes! Tina Sparkle! Les, do you think she'll dance with him? Straight after her exhibition, she's hopping into the social dance with Scott! And the next event will be the mother-and-son... Oh, Doug, it's an answer to our prayers. She's a nice little chicky. She photographs well. - Oh, Franny, isn't it exciting? - Er... I thought he'd never find a new partner and now everything's turned out wonderfully. - Do you think so? - Of course I do! - Les and I are beside ourselves! - Well, I'm very happy too. Course you are, lovey. Gee, you look nice tonight. You've been using that buff puff I gave you, haven't you? If he doesn't hurry up, I might jump in there myself. Mr Kendall! Oh, Mum. I was going to tell you... Oh, yes. Very funny, you little devil. Well, we know all about it. - Bloody fantastic, mate! - You should have told us, you know. Uncle Lessie was onto it first. You haven't even seen us dance yet. Oh, come on, son. You two were made for each other! I find it difficult to get the films now. It's all video, video, video. For goodness' sake, Doug. She's not the slightest bit interested. Look at her. She's beside herself. Oh, who would have thought it, eh? Our Scott dancing with someone like Tina Sparkle. Yes. The fairy princess of the dance floor, Miss Tina Sparkle, and for the last time current Pan-Pacific... - Tina Sparkle. - Fran, l... Mr Nathan Starkey! Oh, isn't Tina beautiful? Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, dancing together for the last time, Mr Nathan Starkey and Miss Tina Sparkle. What a great partnership... ..and what a show, as they dance for you the Fruity Rumba. - She's a funny girl. - Be back in a minute. Ah, they're beginning with a lovely double rondé shuffle. Yes. Let's hear that applause. Well deserved. Watch it, Frangipani! Listen, sweetie, I'm the one driving the engine around here, all right? Oh, you're driving the engine? What's that in the Thermos? Hi, Scott. - Have you seen Fran? - Fran? Fran who? Jeez. It's a double... Oh, into a quick whip split! Beaut! Oh, yes, a beautifully arced crest move. That will go down a treat with the judges at the Pan-Pacific this year. Do you know where Scott went? - Excuse me. - Excuse me. (Shirley) Excuse me. (Les) Excuse me. Excuse me. All these steps can be found on Barry Fife's brilliant video Dance To Win. Priced at 29.95, it's a must. President Mr Barry Fife will be personally signing copies of his brilliant video later tonight in the foyer. Oh, yes, it's classy... Oh, a twilight lift. Oh, look at this. Fran, I didn't know anything about that. Are you going to dance with Tina? I... She's a champion. I think you should. She's your style. You'd really suit each other. I've been working towards winning the Pan-Pacifics since I was six years old. Beautifully struck. I'm sure you'll win. I could never do that. Flowing into the reverse whip split.

I don't want to hear it. Les, give me a hand. She'll be dancing with a brand-new partner. Tina, wonderful, wonderful! The fruit, everything. Les, President Fife would like a word with you and Scott at the servery, now! - What's going on? - Oh, a silly accident. This poor girl fell. - I'm Shirley Hastings. - Mum... - Scott, Tina's been dying to meet you. - Hello, Tina. Look, Mum... No, Scott. We'll look after Fran. You need to have a chat with President Fife. Better not keep him waiting. We'll be back for the social. Tina, take your time getting changed. Come on, Scott. - Scott. - See ya. A top routine, Teens. Heh-heh. Eurgh. I thought that was good. - Come on, come on. - Mrs Hastings... I don't know what you two thought you were doing. There's obviously been a whole lot of things going on, but we're going to fix that nasty bruise and then, Fran, I think it'd be best for everyone if you went home. - But we were... - You're a beginner, Fran. What the hell did you think you were doing? And you're really clumsy. That's why you fell over. - Scott wanted... - Well, of course Scott would say that. But you don't want to ruin his chances, do you? Do you? Now... you can see that it would be best for everybody concerned if you just went home and forgot all about this, can't you, Franny? Can't you? Yes, Mrs Hastings. I understand that Les has lined you up with Tina Sparkle. Well, don't blow it, son, because if you don't start listening to your teachers and superiors, there won't be a mark on the scorecard low enough for you at the Pan-Pacific. - Comprende? - Barry's only thinking of your wellbeing. Where would we be if everybody made up steps? Out of a job. Don't listen to him, Barry. He's excited because he's going to dance with Tina. He doesn't know what he's saying. Scott! Scott! Now, we can't expect Tina to wait around all night. Yes, I know, Terry. I'm sorry. Oh, Tina. Oh, my goodness, you look terrific. What the hell was that all about? You know, with Fran. (Shirley) Fran, Fran, Fran... Fran? Fran! - Fran, Fran, Fran... - Fran? - Wasn't she that girl that fell over... - Well, here we all are. - Where is she? - Who? - Fran. - Fran who? Fran, you know, the girl that fell. Oh, she went home, darling. Don't worry about her. - What? - She went shopping, Scott. - No, she had to make a phone call. - You're pathetic. - What's wrong with you? - That's what I've been trying to find out for the last three weeks, Wayne. What's wrong with me? What is so wrong with the way I dance? Come on, now, Scott. Tina's waiting. You're all so scared you wouldn't know what you thought. - Look, is he dancing with Tina or not? - Yes. I'm sorry, Tina. I'm not available. No, Scott! Wayne, Wayne! - Well... - Scott! What's going on? Care for a dance, Teens? Jesus, you danced impressively today. - Do you think so, Mr Fife? - Oh, God, yes. You should try a bogo pogo in your samba, though. It's a terrific step, especially coming out of a lock twist. - Yeah, well, actually... - It's in me video. You got one? - Er, well, no. - Take this one. Gee. Well, thanks, Mr Fife. You know, Scott's not the only one with a future to think about. - It's Wayne, isn't it? - Yeah, Wayne. Yeah. I've seen this bad influence before, Wayne. You know, one bad egg can rot the whole barrel. Know what I mean? Hmm? Fran. - What are you doing here? - I want to dance with you. Go away. I'll get in trouble. What happened to "a life lived in fear" and all that stuff? It's no use. You were right. I'm a beginner. I'll never be like them. I don't want you to be like them. You're better than all of them. Fran, I want to dance with you at the Pan-Pacifics. We won't win. I just want to dance our steps. Francisca! - My dancing partner. - You go now! - Go! Go! - No! We just dance together, that's all! What sort of dance do you dance so late at night? Paso doble. Paso doble? What? You dance the paso doble? Yeah. Show. Show. Yes. We want to see this paso doble. Come on. Show us your paso doble. Show me your paso doble. Paso doble! Hey, it's all right. Just try and keep up. Four-count intro. What? What's so funny? Paso doble? Ha! Paso doble. Hey! Grandma would like to teach us. Where do you feel the rhythm? No, no, no, no. (♪ Hums paso doble melody) Listen to the rhythm. Don't be scared. You follow. Have you eaten? If you haven't, there's some chops in the fridge. - No, I'm fine. - How could you? How could you do that to Tina? - She's a Pan-Pacific champion. - Mum... First thing in the morning, you get on that phone and you apologise. - I won't be dancing with Tina. - What? - I'm dancing with Fran. - Fran? Doug, he said he won't be dancing with Tina! I heard. Well, do something about it, you silly man. - Why do you pick on Dad all the time? - How dare you speak to me like that? The sacrifices that we have made for you - - the money, the time, and the effort. - Oh, shut up! And what about Les? He has taught you everything you know and you're just throwing it back in his face. - I'm bored with it. - I don't believe that I'm hearing this! I have been with your father for 25 years! Do you think I get bored? Of course I do, but you stick with your goals. And eventually they bring their own rewards. - What rewards? - Winning the Pan-Pacific. I don't care about winning the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix! Ooh! He doesn't care about winning the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix? That's what he said. He just wants to dance his silly steps with Fran. - Oh, that's great for the studio, isn't it? - Wayne, don't let your imagination - run away with this. - It's true, Mrs H. It's like President Fife says - one bad egg can rot the whole barrel. No. You are all overreacting. Nothing terrible is going to happen! What? Ken dropped me. Oh, dear. People will laugh at me. - No. - Yes! You just got not to be scared. All right? You remind me of your mother, you know? I am very proud of you. And if... if your mum was here she will be very proud too. Fran! Francisca! Fran! Francisca! It's too jazzy. Don't throw away your energy. See - keep the focus between you. The face, strong. Hyah! Hyah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Very good. New steps, new steps, new steps, new steps, new steps, new steps, new steps, new steps, new steps! New steps, new steps, new steps! New steps, new steps, new steps, new steps, new steps! There are no new steps! I unequivocally state there are no new steps ratified for the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix! Comprende? This is getting out of hand. Oh, Charm, stop it! I got to think. Something's got to be done about this. (Barry) If you can't dance the step, you can't teach it, and if you can't teach it, we might as well all pack up and go home. With young Liz available again, you've got a chance to get your status quo vadis back, so to speak. Barry, we've tried everything we can to convince him! - Except the truth. - What do you mean? Look, we all go back too far to beat about the bush. I know we agreed that the past should be left in the past but it's about time that lad learned some home truths about where this kind of thing can lead. I'd better fill the drinks machine. (♪ Ignatius Jones: Rumba de Burros) Olé! Olé! You are ready, kids! You are ready. Yes. They are ready. (Shirley) We've tried everything we can to convince him! (Barry) Except the truth. Are you nervous about tomorrow? Yeah. Are you? - I never thought we'd make it. - Me neither. Fran. Yeah? You know what I said about the rumba and it being pretend? Yeah? Well... What? I think I made a mistake. - Oh, no! - What? I promised Wayne I'd meet him and help him with his... - bogo pogo. - Bogo pogo. Better not keep him waiting. (Scott) Hey - vivir con miedo es como vivir a medias. Wayne! (Barry) Wayne's not here. Hope you don't mind. We know we can't win but we're going to dance anyway, so let's not waste each other's time. He was the most beautiful dancer I'd ever seen. What? He could have been the greatest champion of them all. But he was like you. He threw it all away. Who? The man in this photograph. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the man who was potentially the greatest ballroom dancer this country's ever seen. I'm talking about your father... Doug Hastings. Oh, come on. Dad doesn't even dance. You think it's funny? You think it's funny, do you? I worshipped that man. We all did. Doug Hastings was an inspiration to us all. But that's Les. Les was Mum's partner. No, Scott. That's Doug. I know to look at him today it's hard to believe, but once... (Barry) Once... (Barry) Ah, once. Doug and Shirley Hastings were the best bloody couple this country had ever seen. Couple number 100! Doug and Shirley Hastings! Couple number 100, Doug and Shirley... (Barry) Couple number 100. You know, Scott, your dad, he had it all - looks, charm, confidence. He had everything, everything. My God, he was magnificent! Rrrrrrr! Whoo! (Barry) Samba, cha-cha, rumba, jive, anything. He could do anything! Brilliant! All the girls loved him. My goodness, he showed those chickies a thing or two. l was your dad's best mate in those days. We'd just scruff it together, you know, swing it around. Lessie would come along, of course. The three of us together, the old gang. We were a bunch of old funsters. We all wanted to win, of course, but with your mum as your dad's partner, we had no chance. They were magnificent. (♪ Boogie-woogie) ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero ♪ Yesterday's hero ♪ That's all I'll be... ♪ They had it all before them - a perfect career. And then... everything changed. Your dad became, l don't know... self-obsessed, focused on himself, a selfish dancer. l didn't know what to make of it. He started doing his own thing, improvising, throwing in crazy, wild, crowd-pleasing steps. A bit like yourself, Scott. Not always... strictly ballroom. Shirley put up with it for as long as she bloody well could. lt was only a matter of time before she eventually... cracked. l tried to warn him, but, no, he wouldn't listen. He wouldn't listen to any of us. He'd lost touch with reality. He was convinced he and your mum could win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix dancing his own steps. Of course, they lost. l was lucky enough to win that year. The shock sent Doug crazy. He vowed he'd never dance again. For a while there we didn't think he'd pull through. Slowly, little by little, day by day, he managed to crawl back from the dark pit of despair and tack together some semblance of a life. When you were born, Doug found a reason to live. He vowed that one day you'd win the trophy that he could never win. That's why I've been so hard on you, Scott. For Doug to see you so close and go the same way he went, it would be too much for him to bear. I really think it'd kill him. I managed to save this as a souvenir. Doug got rid of everything else. Don't tell anybody I've got it. Why... didn't anyone tell me? Doug destroyed your mother's career. We had to keep it from you. Your father's a proud man, Scott. He wouldn't want me to do this, but I'm begging you. Dance with Liz and win the Pan-Pacific once, just once for Doug. He's suffered enough, Scott. Don't you think he deserves a little happiness? Ultimately, of course, it's up to you. You do what you think's best. I know you'll make the right decision. (Barry) Dance with Liz. Win the Pan-Pacific once, just once for Doug. He's suffered enough, Scott. The Pan-Pacific Grand Prix! Come on, number one! Come on! Put your hands together, ladies and gentlemen, for that magnificent old-time Viennese. Thank you, couples. You may leave the floor. - Very good, darling. Very good. - Thank you. Straight down the line. Couldn't fault it. Yes, well done. Well done. Well done. - Jesus, Ken! - I only had one drink! Poor Tina. It's like dancing in a brewery. Couples for the beginners final, please take the floor. Look, Scott! It's Fran! I didn't think she'd turn up. - Back in beginners where she belongs. - And she stole my partner. (Wayne) You made the right decision, mate. I know at times it's been confusing for you, Scott, but I'm speaking for the whole studio when I say that by putting your trust in the federation, you're doing the right thing. And I think this will be reflected in the results of the big one yet to come, the Open Latin final. We're right behind you, boy. Son, can I bend your ear for a tick? Doug! Don't be stupid. He's got to get ready for the Latin. - I must get back to the scrutineers' table. - (Liz) Come on, Scott. - Go for it, boy. - (Shirley) Come on, come on, come on. No, it isn't, Wayne. It's a quick one, a-two, a-three, a-four. You go back to the ballpoint from there. - Excuse me, Mr Fife. - What is it, son? It's the bogo pogo, Mr Fife. - That step you suggested. - Did I? Yeah, you said you'd show it to us if I, er... arranged that other thing for you, remember? - Bit of a hurry at the moment, son. - You know my partner Vanessa Cronin? Well. Hello, sweetie. Having a bit of trouble with the old bogo pogo, are we? The trick to that one is to go down on one heel ball. Then pull the weight up into the chest, puffing it out proud, like a peacock. Then a quick syncopating two and three, and three and four. Comprende? Gee, thanks, Mr Fife. Got to run. Good luck for tonight, kids. - Son, can I bend... - Not now, Dad. What happened to a life lived in fear and all that stuff? - Fran... - You really are a gutless wonder! - There's a reason for this. - I don't want to hear. - Listen to me! - No! - It's hard for me too, Fran. - Hard? Hard? How hard do you think it's been for me? To get you to dance with me in the first place. Frangipani de la Squeegee Mop. Wash the coffee cups, Fran. How's your skin, Fran? Hard? You don't understand. I understand. You've got your Pan-Pacifics to win and I'm back in beginners where I belong. Fran! Scottie, can I bend your ear for a tick? - Not now. - Yes, now, Scott! And now, ladies and gentlemen, the main event of the evening, the one we've all been waiting for, the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Five-Dance Latin final! (Wayne) Mr Fife! Mr Fife! But you ball-change on the one. Wayne, it doesn't matter! Come on. It's OK, Dad. I'm dancing with Liz. There's something you must know, something about the past. Don't worry, Dad. I know. Mr Fife! (Tina) Pissed as a fart! - Wayne! - (Tina) Don't lie to me. You can hardly stand up. (Barry) I've set it up for you to win no matter how you dance. I can't go out there. I've lost the old magic. Pull yourself together, Railings. But you don't understand. I have always regretted... Dancing your own steps at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix. I know. I'm not going to make that same mistake. I never danced at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix. Barry told me you lost the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix dancing your own steps. Barry? Your year, Ken. Just get on the floor, go through the motions, and it's in the bag. When Hastings loses, his credibility will be shot. I'll just go and polish the trophy. (Tina) Thanks, Mr Fife. - Barry was the one that convinced her. - Convinced who? Couple number 100, Scott Hastings and Elizabeth Holt! - Your mother. - Doug, he's been called, you silly man! - Wayne Burns and Vanessa Cronin! - Wayne, we're being called! It's none of our business. - Couple number 176... - (Wayne) Les. - Jonathon Drench and Emily Waters. - Les! Here. Use this. - This is the final call... - Psst! Les! Wayne Burns and Vanessa Cronin! - Mr Railings, could I have your number? - Spud out, nerd! - Couple number 69... - Yes! ..Ken Railings and Tina Sparkle! What are you talking about, Dad? I never danced at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix. - Shut up, Doug! - Barry convinced your mother - to dance with Les instead of me! - Stop it! - What? - Don't listen to him. - It's got nothing to do with you, Scott. - Why didn't you dance with Dad? He wanted to dance his silly steps. We would have lost. You lost anyway, Shirley. You should've stuck by me, for better or for worse. - I did it for you, Doug. - It cost us our dream, Shirley. Barry convinced me that there was too much at stake. Our dancing career was on the line. We would never have been able to teach. I couldn't throw all that away on a dream. We had to survive! 100. Scott Hastings and Elizabeth Holt. Scott! Scott! Scott! This is the final call for couple number 100, Scott Hastings and Elizabeth Holt. Don't listen to him, Scott. Get on that floor. You can win, Scott, win! Win, win, win! Son, it was the dancing that mattered. (Shirley) He doesn't know what he's talking about! It's your day! Your day. You get out there! We should've put that above everything else. We had the chance, but we were scared! We walked away! We lived our lives in fear! No! No, Scott, no! No! No! No! Break out the Bollinger, sweet chops. Oh! - Are you sure? - We heard him. Fran! - Why aren't you... - There's no time. Do you still want to dance with me? I brought this just in case! Come on. I want a word with you. Oh, pull yourself together. It's not my fault the boy chickened out. It wouldn't have made any difference anyway. Out the back. I know what's going on. It doesn't matter what Scott dances out there today. You betrayed his father. What do you expect? But Doug wanted me to dance with Shirley! You told me that! It's easy to believe what you want to hear. Go, Ken! - You won't get away with this! - Listen, you pathetic little fag. Do you hear that? That's the future of dance sport, and no one but no one is gonna change that! What the... Oh. Give me that bloody thing. No, you don't! This is... Shit! Cut the music. Cut the music! - (Kylie) He's going to cut the music! - Barry! (Kylie) Quick, get inside! (Screams) Shut the door! Lock it! (Kylie) It's not working! We have a disqualification. This is Barry Fife speaking. Scott Hastings and partner are suspended until further notice. Will Scott Hastings and partner please leave the floor? This is the final warning for Scott Hastings and partner to please leave the floor! Listen to the rhythm. Don't be scared. No, you don't, little miss! - Shame on you, Miss Leachman. - Oh! Yeah!
