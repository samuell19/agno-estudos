Article 490 of the Moroccan Penal Code: All persons of the opposite sex not related by marriage who have sexual relations with each other are punishable by imprisonment for up to one year. This will balance the 2 plots. And there's a strongpoint. Don't forget the land is in a zone relatively protected from the wind. Don't scare her, it's not a God forsaken hole! It's true but... We're not completely isolated! I fully agree, but we need to talk about it. She needs to be in the know. Tell us about it. There's lots to say. I'm listening. The owner of our neighboring plot died. His children live abroad. Agriculture doesn't interest them. Understandable. They're in a hurry to sell so it's dirt cheap. Of course. Sounds interesting. It's a long-term investment? It's a solid project. It's the perfect opportunity for me to partner with my dear friend Faouzi. And I know plenty of buyers. There you go. Do you plan to develop other products on this new land or keep growing what you already do? I think we'll expand on my current products. They're doing well, why look for more risk? Because it can mean benefits. Sofia, get the dessert, please. My daughter, peel the figs Ahmed brought us. They're figs from your farm? Of course. This all sounds very interesting. Your project is well studied. I'll talk to Jean-Luc. Jean-Luc will love the project. The French have a good nose for business. It's a shame he couldn't come. Sofia, sit down. You've done enough. Let me get the cake, auntie. Lena, go help your cousin. Zineb, it was delicious! It was Mom's recipe. We can't get hung up over our Moroccan droughts. - Are you okay? - Yes. I just have a stomach ache. Where exactly does it hurt? My belly and my back. Can I take a look? What's wrong? Your stomach is hard. I ate too much. Take a deep breath. If I press here, does it hurt? No. When was your last period? I don't know. They do what they want. I think you're pregnant. Sofia? Tell me what are you specializing in? Oncology. Cancer. - Is the tea ready? - Almost. Perfect. Leon l'Africain. That's a very good school. The classes are small. It's expensive, but quality has a cost. We don't have a choice, Ahmed. What happened to you, my daughter? The faucet came unscrewed again. - Did you shut it? - Yes. You're sweating. Are you alright? Her stomach hurts. I'll take her to the drugstore. Maybe it's something she ate? No, don't worry. It'll go away. Lena's right. You don't look well at all. Don't bother, Lena. I'll take her. No uncle, it's kind of embarrassing. It's girl's stuff. Sofia, you ready? Let's go. Take my car keys and call if there's a problem. - Thanks, Mom. - Sofia, put on your djellaba. - Hello - Hello. Her waters broke. When? One hour ago. Your ID please. We left in a hurry without her papers. Do you know your number? Then give me your husband's card. He's not here. Where is he? On a business trip. Go sit down. Can't we find a solution? Even in a private clinic, they won't admit her. They won't risk their reputation. We're under surveillance here too. Do you know what could happen to you? Hey girls, where are you going? Doctor Rehbaoui, please. - Are you okay? - I have a problem. Go to the waiting area. I'll be right there. They'll take her without notifying the police right away. We need the father's papers tomorrow. There are no other options? A department head was denounced recently, they won't take any risks. You'll have to leave right after she gives birth. Sofia... You can give birth here. You know the father's name, right? Sofia. I know you're in pain, but you must tell me the father's name. Yes, Mom. The drugstore was closed. We're at the hospital. No, just to make sure. Don't worry, I'll get back to you. Lena, my parents can't know. Okay? Listen, everything will be settled. You won't have any trouble. Come talk to her, she won't spread her legs. Sofia. You have to let her check you. Would you rather I did it? Breathe. And spread your legs. Please. The baby's coming. Okay, take your time. Breathe. Come on. Now, push. It's a girl. Hi, Mom. Don't shout at me, it's not my fault. We're at Moulay Youssef Hospital. She forgot her phone. Tell her parents... not to worry. That we're coming. I have to go. You have to call the dad. Voicemail. Where does he live? Sofia? Derb Sultan. Sanitary napkins and a blanket for the baby. - Thanks. - The department head is coming. He can't see you here. We have to go. Come on. You can't protect him. He has to accept the consequences. Pull over here. I don't remember where it is. I don't know. What was there downstairs? A cafe? Shops? It was blue. What? Yes? Good evening. I'd like to see Omar. At this time of night? It's very important, please. Who's asking for him? A friend. He's not here. Omar! Where do you think you're going? - What do you want? - I want to see Omar. Get out of my home! He's not here. I want to talk to him. Get out, Omar isn't here! Get out! Who does she think she is? We leave her here and go home as if nothing had happened. If you don't say anything, no one will know. Go find me a box! Don't do it, we'll find a solution. I want to wake up from this nightmare. Stay away! What do you think you can do? You've ignored me for 10 years, you know nothing about me. What solution do you have? He'll acknowledge the child, I promise you. I'll do everything in my power. What's going on? Your parents went to the hospital. They know. They're waiting for us at the maid's. Fatna? Fatna. Mom... You and I will talk later. Your parents are crushed. You've humiliated them. I don't understand, Sofia. We're investing together in a project. One that'll change your parents' life. And you... you go and spoil everything. Do you realize what you've done to us? You must take us to see the father. Right now. - We went. - It's none of your business. I should have let her give birth like an animal? I'm tired. You all tire me. After all I've done for you. Get up. Take us to meet the father. Lena, if you know anything, speak up now. He lives in Derb Sultan. Omar's his name. Derb Sultan... What were you doing in that neighborhood? Who is this Omar? When did you meet him? Almost a year ago. I'm sorry. How can I be sure that it's true? The proof is before your eyes. This is ridiculous. It's called pregnancy denial. - What? - Pregnancy denial. She was pregnant but she didn't know it. Her belly didn't grow. I don't understand a word, but my brother has nothing to do with this. We want to talk to him. Where is he? When will he be back? Would you like some tea? No, thank you. You live in Casablanca? Yes. Where? Downtown. - You too? - No, she lives in Anfa. They say the houses there are magnificent. Drink, my girl, it'll warm you. My son is a good boy. When his father passed away, he became the man of the family. But he's still in mourning, he has a hard time assuming his responsibilities. You know what a father represents for a son. Do you have any sons? I only have one daughter. May God protect her. My boys are the apple of my eye. When my husband was still with us, we managed to get by. He was hard-working. God rest his soul. But today, young people have been left by the wayside. Times are hard for them. What is your profession? My husband is starting up a farming project in Agadir. My sister doesn't work. Her husband runs an export business with Europe. That's wonderful. Why all these questions? Please don't think I'm being impolite, it's just that, if we will become a family, we may as well get to know each other. Omar, come here, my son. What are you doing here? She came to defend her honor. They say that this baby... is yours. You worked with her, right? - I saw her one time. - You saying she's lying? I never touched her! I saw her one time! The idiot got fired from her job, she was crying, so I got her a coffee. Omar, please. Omar, come sit next to me. Move over, my daughter. Do you realize what you're doing? You're ruining her life. You know what happens to women. Who are you? Who are you? You defend women's rights in this country? Okay, that's enough. Let's try to be reasonable. You know how things work. Lawyers, endless discussions, the time it involves, and the money it costs. You didn't come to find an arrangement. You came to trap us. What if I refuse, what will you do? Your father's statement says that you were raped. And Omar's statement says that he met you at the call center, on the day you were fired. He adds that, this was the only time he ever saw you. Is that true? If Omar raped you, he will be sentenced to five years. Five years? On the other hand, if you were not raped, and you had a consenting relationship, you will make a deposition and sign it, and I will do my best to reduce your sentences. She needs to eat. You mustn't be afraid. What matters is that my son stays out of jail. Do you understand? Okay, are you done? My father lied. Omar didn't rape me. I wanted to. Aziz, take this down. Both of us wanted to. To defend me, my father lied to force Omar to acknowledge the child. That day, Omar came to the call center to do odd jobs. I was crying. He saw me in the building entryway, crying all alone in a corner. They had just fired me. They said I didn't achieve the objectives, that my French wasn't good enough. Omar was nice to me. He paid attention to me. I felt something special. He took me to a cafe. We talked. After we left the cafe, I waited a while and followed him. And he... he didn't notice you following him? Only when we got to Derb Sultan. He saw me when he reached his front door. And he invited you in? Yes. He was a nice boy. I felt comfortable with him. And it happened. Tell me... were you a virgin? Yes. Officer, take her away. Where are you taking her? - What's going on? - We took her statement. She admitted she had consenting sexual relation. She stays here until she sees the Royal public prosecutor. What? Why the public prosecutor? Please do something. You can't leave her here. Mom, where are you going? I'm going home. Why don't you do something? Like what? I don't know, talk to the captain. Find an arrangement. What arrangement? Offer him money. What? Hey you! Get up! - Where's Omar? - Keep moving and shut up! It's okay. - You okay? - Yeah. A bit tired. Where's the baby? With your mother. Sofia. Sit down. Would you like some coffee or tea? No. Go on, Omar. Forgive me. Who me? Say it to her. Omar admits to having slept with you. What? Then, it's all over? It's all over. You see? Everything is as it should be. Isn't it... Mr. Omar? I decided to acknowledge the child and marry you. But why? What do you mean, "why"? Do you like trouble or what? No... I don't want any trouble. Then why all these questions? I just want to understand. There's nothing to understand. I contacted the hospital. They're waiting for you to bring your papers. You don't have much time. You need to go this week. Alright? Go on, Omar, take your wife and settle your business. If you need anything at all, I'm here. Here's my card. Thank you. Come on. Can I come in? Your feet are cold. I don't understand what happened. What don't you understand? I don't know. This whole thing isn't like you. You never go out... I didn't think... I thought he wanted something serious. When we met the first time, we talked about lots of things. He said, "A girl like you, "she deserves someone... "who takes care of her, "who treats her well." He had problems. He didn't have a stable job. Life was difficult for him. - Your parents never knew? - Are you crazy? I don't know. You could've talked with your mom. Are you in love with him? Do you really think love is important? Yes, I do. I don't know, maybe. I think that love comes with time, when you get used to the person, and really start to get to know them. That's when love grows. Love at first sight only happens in the movies. We all know we can't stop gossip. But we can try to minimize the damage. First we take care of the paperwork, then we organize a wedding. Okay? We'll tell the family, the neighbors, and everyone else that they had a religious ceremony a year ago. Then we throw a party to make it official. End of story! What about the baby? We'll hide it. 10 dirhams of sunflower seeds, please. How are you, my girl? We haven't seen you in ages. Here you go. We were at my aunt's. The one married to the Frenchman? - How is she? - Good. You know, Sofia, rumor has it that Ahmed and your father will be partners soon. God willing. You'll forget us and move to the rich part of town. We won't leave without you. God bless you. I have to go. Give your family my regards. Go to your room. - Ahmed, something to drink? - I have to run. I brought the contracts for you to sign. Very well. Initial them and sign the last page. Fine, thanks. Ahmed, what time tomorrow? The prefecture opens at 9:00. I'll never cry again. Get up, you have to get ready. The sutures of the skull are perfect. The ears... Be careful. No, don't cry. Don't cry. Let's check the mouth... She has a good sucking reflex. It's okay, it's okay. We're done. We'll stop bothering you. So then, everything looks good. She weighs 3.2 kilos and measures 50 cm. She's a healthy baby, everything is fine. How is the breastfeeding going? Fine. How many feedings today? Three or four. Good. You should feed her every three hours. What you've been through isn't easy. Maybe... you could see someone, like a psychologist. Someone to help you with your new life. What do you say? Pregnancy denial never happens by accident. It's a defense mechanism, an unconscious protection. In your case, it's probably related to the fear of your parents' reaction. Don't worry, they'll get used to it. Trust me, I'm sure. Hello. - Coffee for me. - Orange juice. So what, you had a baby out of wedlock. It doesn't matter. Omar has agreed to marry you and recognize your daughter. You have to stop tormenting yourself. It's not worth it. Look around, the world is changing. My mother could care less about what I do. Your parents just need a little more time. But it'll blow over. I guess. Excuse me. - Is that fresh-squeezed? - Yes, ma'am. The color is odd. It tastes fine. Sorry, it's not natural. I can show you the machine. I know what I'm talking about. It's cut with canned juice. Get me another one please. Fine. Fatna, no water guns in the house. That's right, the white tablecloths. Hello, sweetie. The white embroidered ones! Yes, that's it. We agreed on this ages ago. Do what's necessary, the wedding is in three days. Thank you. Stop eating. Go get the serving dishes I brought from France. - Did you bring the caftans, girls? - Yes. Sofia, give me a full box. The big night is coming soon! She's not afraid? I don't think so. Sofia, count these for me. I remember my wedding night with Ahmed. What a fiasco! I barely touched him and it was over. Shame on you! The fireworks before the party! Well, what? He showed off our whole engagement. I went all out and he was about fainted. Are you okay? Can I ask you a question? Does it always hurt when you sleep with a boy? Why do you ask that? Did it hurt with Omar? Omar never touched me. I don't understand. Then who's the father? - Ahmed. - Ahmed? Did he force you? You lied to me. You lied to everyone. Everyone accused Omar, including me. Why didn't you say anything? When did it happen? I don't know. I think the weekend you went to Fez. - So, what do we do? - Nothing at all. - He has to pay! - Shut up! I don't think you understand you're a victim. Who are you to tell me what to do? Huh? After everything I did for you? What did you do for me? You asked your mom to bribe the police captain, that's all. Wake up, Lena. This situation suits everyone. I'm not in jail, I saved my family's honor. Omar will find work and help his family. Dad's project carries on and your mother can stop supporting us. Sofia, be quiet. We have to stop this. Mom. I'm thinking. You want to cancel the wedding? What do we tell the guests? You borrowed a fortune from your sister to impress everyone and now you want to call it off? I won't let you do this. Be quiet, please. You're crazy. You chose Omar. I suppose you love him. Zineb, listen to me. Faouzi and Jean-Luc have invested a lot of money. The guy's project is solid. Think it over. The guy? He's a fucking rapist. Lena! This isn't the time. You don't see the big picture. I think that... it's up to Sofia to decide what she wants. I don't want to call off the wedding. In that case, we have a lot of work to do. Your ID please. Omar Saadou. Sofia, you too, please. Sofia Lotfi. Omar, how much did you give for the dowry? Two gold Louis. Did you receive your dowry, Sofia? Yes. Omar, do you take Sofia to be your wedded wife? Yes. Sofia, do you take Omar to be your wedded husband? Yes. Please sign here, Omar. Sofia... Thank you very much. Why did you do this to me? You could've refused. Refused? You really think I had the possibility? My own mother didn't support me the day I needed her. She knows it's a chance for us, and a chance for you to become a man. I am a man. That's why I chose you. You didn't choose me, you didn't have anyone else. I'll be a good wife and a good mother. It's a chance for both of us. You know it, or you wouldn't have acknowledged the child. Maybe you're right. It's time for me to become a man, as you say, a man who assumes his responsibilities. Time to get out of my mess and marry into a good family. One that'll find me a job so I can help my mother. On the other hand, Sofia, don't fool yourself, I'll never love you. I waited for you to choose a name for our daughter. Call her what you want, I don't give a shit. I don't like it, it's outdated. Don't be difficult, I had it made last year. It's not out-of-fashion yet. Here. Try this one instead. Or you can wear one of your little black dresses. The strapless one is simple and elegant. I'll be the only one in a dress. You should see the caftans your cousin chose for the wedding. My God, what horrible taste. The poor girl, she's so beldi. I adore that one. Those are your colors. It's very flattering. It's your style. No, it's your style. Look, it drags on the floor. I'll trip and fall. I don't like it. You're being a real pain today. Put it on right at least. I have eyes, it swims on me. You didn't put it on right. There. That's better already. Stand on your tiptoes. It's perfect! It'll look fab with the Jimmy Choos. They're too high, I can't walk in them. Lena, please make an effort! I'm trying to help you. Shit. It's too late to worry about what you'll wear. You know what? If you're not happy, find a store or call your friends. Because... I'm fed up! Do you realize how agressive you are with me? You're the agressive one, Mom. I don't understand. I don't understand! Why are you making me pay for all this? I did everything I could! I did what was best for everyone. Yourself included. It's about time you grew up. You think people can do what they want. But the world's not like that, honey. Do you understand me? No, I don't understand. Of course not. Of course not. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry, Lena. It's funny... I wore the same color for my wedding. The exact same color. Remember? I showed you the photos. Yes, I think so. It was a beautiful wedding. A traditional wedding. We wanted to show your father's family a real Moroccan wedding. Like always, it was a bit too much. But everyone loved it. Everyone danced till dawn. Your uncle actually stopped the orchestra and sang Elvis songs for us. - Uncle Faouzi? - Yes, I think he drank too much Does he drink alcohol? Sure, he'd have a drink occasionnally then. Like everyone else. In any case, we had a good laugh. We got back to the hotel and your father went to bed. And I had all those damned hairpins to take out of my hair. It was a nightmare. It took me over an hour. I was exhausted. The hairpins, the high heels, the heavy caftan that I didn't even choose! The false eyelashes... All the fuss, it was endless. Endless. But despite all, the guests said they'd never seen such a smiling bride! Why are you telling me all this? This isn't about you. Because I didn't marry your father for love. That's why I'm telling you. I found him handsome... intelligent, openminded and kind... But I wasn't in love. I married him in hopes of a better life. I wanted you to have everything the day you were born. And you see, we don't need anything today. We're happy, right? Why are you telling me this now? Because you must understand that for Omar, this marriage, is a true opportunity. A way out. Believe me. Did you see where he lives with his family? Get real. You call that a future? No, sweetie. Don't be sad for them. Not for him or for Sofia. What's happening to them is good. It's what's best for Omar. Of course, it won't be easy for him at first. But he'll gradually get used to it. You'll see. People get used to anything. What'll you do with your hair tomorrow? I don't know. You want to have it blow-dried? I don't want to straighten it. That's a shame, I like when it's straightened. It's a nice change. Even if I always find you beautiful. And what will you wear? I don't know. Omar. Please. - I need to talk to you. - What for? I spoke to my father. You're getting a promotion. I want to help you guys. I'd put aside some vacation money, but you have better use for it. You can buy clothes for Amal. At this age, babies grow fast. They cost a lot. Thank you. I've never done crazy things in my life. But tonight, I'm going to fuck a high-class whore.
