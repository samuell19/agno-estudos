So, you've got these kind of moments where you keep encountering these three foot here, three foot there, and they're basically the reach of an adult male. And it's interesting that... I don't know if this was subconscious, but it's almost like the architect had stood in the garden and then reached out from the house, and where their fingertips were, that's where a retaining wall would be. A low retaining wall. So, all the way around the house you've got these moments of...of reach.

Heh. I'm always doing that. You know... So, you know, the way it's been cut, it means that you've got these different levels. The different views from the different floors of the house give you a very particular kind of layering, you know, of the foliage and what not. It's good. Yeah, OK. Yeah, thank you. It's great, very unique. Should we go back inside? Yeah. I have to say, I have always wanted to be inside this house. Exactly.

And I have to say, I spend a lot of time nowadays when I'm looking at certain situations, I'm brought back to your work somehow. It stays with me, it haunts me, it somehow... It feeds my... It works as a road map to try and unpack a lot of these kind of psychological aspects of the domestic that are normally quite hard to reach. When you're working on something yourself, are you...? What are you responding to most profoundly? Is it the place itself or is it the things that come from your private life that somehow find their way into the work?

I have no other purpose. I know, but it's funny because you say that about my work, but actually I find you very withholding emotionally and you never talk about your emotions or what you're feeling.

Right, and normal gallery hours or do you try and keep it open later? No, normal, I think. It's really good. Did you tell her all that or not yet? No. Interesting. We sort of talked around it. I said a few things, probably a bit too much. I don't think you can say too much. It's fine, it's good. You know, when someone offers you an exhibition like that, it's kind of commitment, you know? That means they believe in the work and that they want to show it and that, um... It's fine, you don't have to think about anything else. It gives you freedom to work, in a way, maybe. Mm. Or to think at least. COMPLETE SILENCE HEAVY TRAFFIC BIRDS SING CAR RUSHES PAST '40s STYLE DANCE MUSIC King Was In The Counting House by Al Bowlly # The king was in the counting house # The counting house # Counting his money Wearing an artful grin # The queen began to plead then roar And cried once more # "Unlock this door!" # The king replied, "Shan't, I'm busy, you can't come in." # When you were eating honey # Then you made me wait this through # For your housekeeping money # You can wait Like I had to wait for you # The king was in the counting house # The counting house # So the butcher and baker Had to take IOUs. # The case against you is too strong. It's not a question of whether you'll be found guilty, but when. I am a gentleman. I am a gentleman's wife. Soon to be a gentleman's widow. In truth, I would do the same again.
