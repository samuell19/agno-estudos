I'd always wanted to act and write, and while I was at drama school, I had written the first part of the trilogy, which is called Children which you are about to see. I'd sent it all over England to mostly television companies. Everybody turned it down. So I thought, 'It can't be any good. ' And I used to go home from drama school in the Midlands once every three weeks, because I missed home so much. And I came in one Friday night, and on BBC1 there was something called Cinema Now And they had an item on the Production Board. So off I sent my script to the BFI Production Board and six months later, I was asked by Mamoun Hassan to go down and see him. He said, 'You have &8,500. Not a penny more. You will direct. ' I said, 'I've never directed anything before. I know nothing about film direction. ' He said, 'Well, now is your chance. ' And so we made it for &8,500, and I came in &1,700 under budget, I remember. Apart from the cameraman on this, who was Bill Diver, who was the most enormous support throughout this, this was the most unpleasant experience of my life. (Laughs) The crew hated the script, they hated the way I directed. They gave me a very, very hard time. I couldn't have got through it without Bill Diver's support. He was just great. Three weeks of utter misery. And that's me, because we couldn't afford anybody to blow a whistle. You snitch We'll get you tonight! We found this school just opposite the Everyman Theatre in Hope Street. All of it has been pulled down since. Which seems odd when I go up to Liverpool now, and all this has gone. He was a lad from a local drama school, the McKee School, who... were wonderful, wonderful helps. In fact, all the children were from the McKee School. And alas, Mrs McKee and her daughter have now died and that school has been closed down, I heard, last year. But they were very, very helpful. He was a lovely little lad, Phillip. There he is. Only 14. He must be in his forties now. I find that extraordinary. Cos I still think of him as 14. Lovely little lad. Mr Universe MAN Benson And this, of course, being part of my autobiography, when I was this age, and having to go through these medical rituals, which were terrifying beyond belief. I was terribly self-conscious about my body and physique. And having to undress in public was just absolutely dreadful to me. Still is. I can't do it even now. Even though probably I want to. (Laughs) Mr Universe This was largely natural light, because there were windows all round, and it gives it this lovely, milky quality. Breathe in Out And again It was originally shot on 16mm. It's now been blown up to 35mm. I remember when, just before we began shooting, they said, 'It's in color. ' I said, 'No, it's got to be black and white. Will they let me do it in black and white?' And they said, 'Of course you can. ' ( Cough echoes) Well, go on, you can get dressed now Thank you doctor I do remember the first week or so, being terribly embarrassed about saying 'Action' and 'Cut', cos when I heard the playback, I sounded like the Queen Mother after she died. It was kind of terrifying. A lot of this was natural light. And when I was talking to Bill Diver about the look, he said, 'Who is your favorite painter?' I said, 'Well, actually, it's Vermeer. ' And he said, 'I can't guarantee that you'll have Vermeer. ' I said, 'Not that I want that, but if we could have that lovely, soft black and white, where it's not just grey. There's texture in the blacks as well. ' And... That's what we got. You two boys stop that I did a lot of amateur acting before I went up to drama school. And this man Harry was one of the directors of one of the plays I was in. Where I played an ill vicar. The Black sheep of the Family it was called, By Leonard du Garde Peach and Ian Hay. He was a lovely man. He was with a company called The Strolling Players. It seems a million years ago now. But a lovely man. A lovely voice. Both of you come with me We'll get you What's awful about bullying is the sadism of waiting for it to happen. I remember being told that they'll 'get me' at the end of the day. Which meant that you had all day to worry about it. When I was at secondary school, I was beaten up every day for four years and I didn't tell a soul. And it does something to you. It robs you of your self-esteem. And you never, never get that back. However hard you try. It's very, very hurtful even now. Cos it's done casually. And there's nothing worse than casual cruelty. Well, actually there is, there's something worse than casual cruelty. It's casual kindness. That really does pierce your heart. And this was common. Caning was absolutely common. Just wait 'til tonight. TEACHER Tucker When I think how docile we were - God! And then you were expected to say thank you. And one did. Tucker Yes sir? Aren't you forgetting something? Sir? Your shoe, boy. Put your shoe on Not here, boy. Outside. Yes, sir. 揧es, sir.? Thank you sir It was the first time I realized, only after we'd finished, that a lot of the time people are lit directly from windows, which is an influence of Vermeer, because there's always that kind of light in Vermeer's paintings. But I love natural light falling on the subject. Where there is shadow as well. There's something so exquisite about it. And I do like that shot. I'm rather proud of that shot, I must say. This shot is really quite clumsy. And the next series of shots you'll see the fact that I'm completely inexperienced. This is a very dull shot. In fact, most of these shots - except one - is pretty dull in this sequence. So, there's no life in this at all, I don't think. We should have gone in close... now. Study the predicate And gone in close on him. Page 56 boy page 56 Thank you, sir We should have gone in close there on the 'Yes, sir,' or at least after the line is said. This is where it does seem very, very clumsy now. But I can only say I was inexperienced and I promise it won't happen again. Again here, we should have gone in close. Because the joke is actually lost. That's not the predicate Neither is that Yes, we should have gone in close on both of those things and re-recorded the sound, because it抯 very echoes and you can't actually hear what's being said. I like that. I think that's rather nice, that shot. This is literally what happened. Mr Nicholls did that kind of thing to you all the time. I won't forget to tell you when it's time to stop lad Although it's slightly dark, there's something beautiful about that light that's light outside, but slightly darker inside. And the way he just drops his head. That's when I realized, only many, many years later, that when people do things like that, which you can't direct, are incredibly moving. Quietly Put your books away Quietly! Collect the exercise books Right In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen We were hampered really by this echo in this room. Which sort of obscures the dialogue. I suppose really one should have post-dubbed it, but... you can't know everything. And this is telling you the obvious. And lead us not into temptation That shot is too low. It should be slightly higher and slightly further round to the left. Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus Holy Mary mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost Amen Get into line. Turn. Eyes front there, boy Or would you like to lead them out? Well, come on, boy What would you say? (Mimicking teacher) Let's go into the school yard Any more of that and you'll get a kick up the backside Or should I say 'arse'? - Good night boys ALL. Good night, sir Off you go This school has gone. All this has gone. Been pulled down. This next shot is rather nice. I do rather like that. And the one that follows it. Now, that's not bad for a first-timer. Would you agree? We got, through the local council, this house which we filmed in, which stood in for my home in Kensington Street. This is a local doctor's. It's an awfully clumsy shot. This was Robin Hooper, who was actually with the Everyman Theatre company at the time. I knew from drama school a woman called Bim Hopewell, who was working there. She was a set designer. She introduced me to the people who were actually in the company at the time. This was in Market Street Baths, where we used to have to go every Monday. I dreaded it, I hated it so much. Because I couldn't swim, because I was terrified of water. There's young Trevor Eve. They were doing the Beatle show at that time, and he was actually playing Paul McCartney. This happened when we went there one Monday, for swimming lessons. And I used to stay in the shower as long as I could, because I was terrified of getting in the main bath. And this man came in and started getting washed. And that was the first time I was very conscious of somebody else's body, which I was terrified by. This is actually a doctor's surgery. We didn't need to do anything to it. Look at all that wonderful stuff that's in there. You can't really direct that. I just said, 'Leave it as it is, cos it's lovely. ' And again, light coming from a window. Back at work do you think? Oh yes I'm feeling much better And I'd rather be at work anyway Good boy Robbie Mother keeping well, son? What? your mother That must be the longest double take in the history of cinema. I can only say that I was clumsy. And I didn't really know what I was doing. But you have to learn. just stay off for the rest of the week then go back on Monday I've er given you some more tablets For the depression Thanks, doctor Which didn't work at all, I can tell you. So I stopped taking them. Depression is just something that you have to live with, I think. And I've lived with it now for so long that you sort of get used to it. But it was awful at the time, because when you are young and terrified of life and the world, it becomes very, very hard. Especially when I was a very devout Catholic at the time I was 22. And I hated being gay. Still do. It's ruined my life. Goodbye, doctor. And thanks Goodbye, son. Hence having to make these three films as a catharsis, I suppose. Although I've never achieved catharsis. I wished and hoped I would, but I never have. But then God will have his little joke. These shots are very, very clumsy. I haven't managed to pull this off at all. They're supposed to look at him and snigger at him, but it doesn't really work. What we should have done is we should have gone straight to that, which would have been much more succinct. But again, lovely milky light. That lovely little baby with the woman floating by in the background, which one couldn't have directed. Can we go inside Mum? If you like son His mum is played by Val Lilley, who was also at the Everyman Theatre company at that time. (Bell) This particular day, we had this bus for &25 for an entire day. Can you imagine? (Chuckles) Now, this I call my angora sweater shot. By the time it runs through the projector, you could actually knit one. Two minutes and 20 seconds. I wouldn't dare do it now. The music is by Shostakovich. It's from the Eighth Symphony In the symphony, there's a wonderful string tremolando, which supports this long, long oboe solo. Which we couldn't afford. We could only afford the oboe soloist. And it's incredibly long. I don't know how I dared do it. I wouldn't dare do it now. There are people who say that they love it, but you really do get an OBE if you can stay awake. (Cor anglais solo) I do like the way the light falls. And the changing scenes behind. Cos most of this has gone in Liverpool. It's just all gone. But I love the relative darkness of the interior, with the light changing outside. It's far too long, but I do love that. There's something wonderful about changing light, going from dark to light to dark or vice versa. There's something truly exquisite about that. I think it might have been sustained if we could have afforded the piece actually from the symphony itself. It would have sustained it, but on its own, just the oboe on its own, it's just too exposed. And then this is rather weak, I think. Perhaps one should just have cut it all straight away. I don't know. (Whispers) (Crying) No, that kind of conventional reaction, well, really, do we need it? No, I don't think we do. But I did at the time. There's something rather sad about that shot as well. I don't know what it is. I think it's the milky light and the perspective. This is the block of flats that Mum and I lived in before I went to drama school. And after all my siblings got married. This has also been pulled down now. This has all gone as well. And the rest of the sequence is actually in my mum's flat. (Man howling in pain) And this sequence now, again it's poetic license. This happened when I was seven. No, six. Not when was at secondary school But I used it to heighten the tension in the drama now. Because my father spent two years dying at home. MAN Argh! (Howls in agony) In those days they didn't give you the morphine that you needed for cancer, and there were so many injections you had a day, and then when they wore off, this is what you had to put up with. And he was a very violent man anyway. And so when he wasn't being violent or drugged, he was screaming in pain and became even more violent. And this went on for two years. Argh! You hurt me! You bleeding hurt me! Argh! Nick Stringer was from the Everyman. So was Elizabeth Estensen, who plays the nurse. She's, I think, in Emmerdale Farm now. How long has he been there? Get out! NURSE He'll see worse Die! You bastard! Die! I was terribly worried about that. I had to say to his parents, 'He has to swear. Is that all right?' And they said, 'Yes, he doesn't mind. ' It was so sweet And that's my mum's living room. We bought that unit together, I remember, when I was still working as a bookkeeper. (Fire crackling and clock ticking) My father would have these ideas that my mother was going out with all sorts of men. And she wasn't. She was too browbeaten. And she wasn't that kind of woman anyway. Where do you go with ten children anyway? (Mouths) This is clumsy. We should have gone in here. Because she mouths, 'Don't go to bed. Don't go to bed. ' Which is what my mum used to say to my two older sisters, before he'd start beating her. Time for bed You'd better get back upstairs Where is he, eh? your fancy man Did you have it off with him while I was in the army? How many times eh Nell? How many bleeding times? Somebody at the church? While was out with the cart? Does Peter get some too? Has that bastard been here? Has he? (Slaps and screams) Argh! You bleeding cow! (Howls) Shut up Of course, he was infinitely worse than this. Cos it would go on for much, much longer. And that stretched for all her married life. I mean, so this is just a snippet of what he was like. The structure came by itself really. And it is true that it could be seen as the young lad looking forward or older Tucker looking back. But that structure came instinctively. I didn't really have to do much. That just felt right. Oh Jesus! (Whistling and cheering) It's done in a rather clumsy way. I'm still feeling my way forward, about the nature of time and memory. I think the last part of the trilogy does it best. (Piano note) (Children hum note) This reminds me of what literally happened at primary school. We'd sing 'Way Down Upon The Suwannee River'. And Mr Lane used to strike the note and we would all go 'Mmm' and stand up very dutifully and then begin singing about people being on the Suwannee River. In Liverpool in 1954. # There's where the old folks stay... This is all shot with natural light. This building has gone as well, it's all been pulled down. And the headmaster would not let us film inside the school. So we had to take surreptitious stills like this inside. And they sort of work really. # Everywhere I roam It is as if those primary school days are long, long, long ago. Which, of course, they are. CHILDREN I believe in one God And the ritual of prayer. We prayed twice a day, for goodness' sake. maker of all things visible and invisible I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten son of God And one did believe as well. I believed until I was 22. More fool me. MAN. We humbly beseech thee for the soul of thy servant which thou hast this day commanded to pass up this world This does sound terribly camp and over-articulated. I had to do this, because we couldn't afford anybody else to do it. received by the holy angels and be conducted to paradise its true country That as this has happened and believed it may not suffer the pains of hell it may take possession of eternal joys through Christ our Lord Amen The person on the very, very far right, with the white hair, is my mother. Cos there were people, friends, who stood in as extras. This is extraordinary in the sense that he didn't breathe. He breathed through his back. It was extraordinary the way he controlled... his breath control here. This is literally what happened. It took hours and hours and hours for him to die and then he just died. And someone put pennies on his eyes, because eyelids stay open. It's a cliche to think that they close. They don't. (Weeps) (Robbie tries to suppress moans) Originally it was a complete single track on to his face, and then we cut it. I don't think it quite works, because it's neither one thing nor the other. Bang bang You're dead Is your Mam in, lad? The woman on the left is from the Everyman Theatre company. The woman on the right, I acted with in The Strolling Players. She was very, very good in Pinter actually, funnily enough. Got a wonderful wry sense of humor. I'm scared Mrs May. I'm scared. What of, ad? I'm scared to go past the parlor, Mrs May Well, your dad can't hurt you now, son The dead can't bite And those days, people did come and look at the body. And the body was in the house for something like ten days. And there was an awful smell of both rotting flesh and the stuff they put down to actually kill that smell. It's a particular smell and it's absolutely disgusting. This is the shot that the crew really didn't like. And told me so. They said it should all be in close-up, I remember. And I said, 'That's how I see it. ' Which sounded a terribly feeble argument. But I saw it like that. At the end of every day, Bill Diver would drive me home and say, 'Make the film that you want to make. If that's how you see it, then that's how you do it. ' He was an enormous support. Thanks for the wreath. It's lovely And at the end of this thing, the two women do the most wonderful sigh. I didn't direct that. They just did it, and I thought, 'Ah, I've got to keep it. ' It was so right. That's when you start to learn what not to do. And how not to direct. And it's a wonderful sigh. (Sighing) Isn't that splendid? With being the youngest of ten, I wasn't experienced enough in my first film to write about lots of people. And my relationship with my mother did feel sometimes as if I were an only child. Which is why I confined it down to one child. And then in Distant Voices Still Lives I did my two oldest sisters and my oldest brother. And then The Long Day Closes was the rest of the family. It was my trajectory really. Me getting more and more confident. (Clock ticking) It really was terrifying having a coffin in the front room. Because in those days you couldn't afford a chapel of repose. They actually had people dead at home. I like the bareness of this. And I remember getting my funeral clothes and smelling them. And they had a particular smell. Which is what I'm doing. (Car outside) When I was going through my mum's papers, after she died, the funeral cost &100. Funerals are horrible, but English funerals are particularly depressing. I can still smell how the house smelled that day. All those years ago. God. This kind of thing is just so hideous and horrible. Why do we have to do it? Why can't we just be taken away and destroyed? Which would be the best way. The most dignified, instead of all this hideousness. I'm very proud of this shot. I like its bareness. And what it is saying emotionally, without saying anything. I'm very, very proud of that. This is pure serendipity. All I wrote was 'We see them come out of the house' and 'We see through the hearse'. That's what I wrote. And this is absolutely pure serendipity. And again, this is something that made my heart leap. I didn't think it would turn out as well as this. I don't think that's too bad for a first-timer, do you? And that's my mum. I remember at the funeral my mother crying uncontrollably, I think, possibly because of relief. This sequence was written when I was at drama school. And my friend there called Ann Kiesler was a good Yorkshire girl, who had been in a play called Dark of the Moon and sang this song to me. Which is a modern version of the 18th-century English folk song 'Barbara Allen' And when she sang it to me, I knew absolutely that I should use it then. And when we were cutting this with the second editor - because the first editor was not very good - I called Sarah Ellis and said, 'Can we do a test sequence where we go in and out of these shots?' And she said, 'Well, I don't think they'll work. ' And we did a test sequence. And we watched them, and she said, 'You're right, it works. ' And, God, I was so thrilled, I wanted to adopt her legally, I was so grateful that she liked it. Dad Oh Dad GIRL # Oh you can be a man, a man # If Barbara will not grieve you # If she be faithful for a year.. This is my very first crane shot. We were on a cherry picker. And it cost &25 for the day. And I was terrified. I'm terrified of heights. And there we were shaking up on this cherry picker. # and will you leave me never? # Oh yes my love A lovely bit of serendipity at the end. The sun goes out, and as the song finishes the sun comes back up again. I mean, that's just serendipity. You can't direct that. God knows, one would like to.
