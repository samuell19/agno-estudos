Three years ago, in the summer: I went overseas with A girl under the pretext of a business trip. Ah, A girl is my "this" (representing a mistress). Because my wife and I only went to Atami for our honeymoon. So, this time going abroad with her was truly exciting. But, I didn't expect that kind of incident to happen. (Stop right there, don't move.) I apologize, please come over here for a moment. Is it this? Excuse me. Do you have any metal items on you? It's because of this, right? Just in case, please take off your belt too. I see, that's fine. Do you have any other metal objects on you? None, right? Can you take them off? Please remove your wig. I apologize. (Based on a true story) Big brother, open the door, I'll be late for school! Wait for 2 more minutes. It's no use fussing with your hair, hurry up! 30 seconds! Dealing with this every morning is unbearable. You've been blow-drying it for so long, and it's still like this. Learn from your little brother. Not having a proper breakfast is why you don't grow hair. It's not related. Rice is the best. Shigeru, You forgot to pay respects to our ancestors again. Everyone's the same. Look, how can you manage like that? Geez. (Note: The word "usui" means pale and sparse hair in Japanese.) I told you the color of the letters is too pale. I'm sorry. If there's no ink, replace the ink cartridge and print again. It can't be this faint. What's wrong, senpai? Oh, nothing. Keep up the good work. Shigeru, let's all hang out together later. You've written it so scattered, is everything okay, Senpai? Ah, it's nothing. Keep going. Shigeru, let's all hang out together later. Thanks, but I have some things to take care of. I see, that's alright then. Sorry, I'll be leaving now. Actually, I don't have anything to do. Going straight home after work is my usual routine. You're lucky. Is it about transferring to a different job? Headquarters said they don't have enough manpower for the next project no matter what. Is the headquarters in Tokyo? Yes. It's a multi-story apartment project, and each company needs to propose a plan. They will choose the best one for implementation. For this project, headquarters wants you to go. How about this village, no shops around here. Yes. Be careful on the way, good luck, don't let any women deceive you. Then, I'll be off. take this. Mao, good luck. oh. No problem with my level, going to Tokyo? I was very anxious at the beginning. I'm sorry. How do I get to this place? Seems like nobody wants to talk to me. This pessimistic me has now become like this. Why not try to change a bit? Is there anyone interested in me at all? Going to the headquarters can only be done the day after tomorrow. This is the opportunity to change my life. Attach the small clip on the wig. Use the clip to attach the wig with artificial skin to my forehead. Clip-on style, this is the most common wig style. It can be taken off easily, and maintenance is straightforward. I see. Use the remaining hair to secure it as a base with this thread. Then, use a special thread to attach the wig on top. This is the weaving style. It won't fall off or shift, and you can wash your hair while wearing it. When your hair grows long every month, please come back to the company for trimming. I see. This is the adhesive wig, where the hair is directly glued to the scalp. How is it? It's very secure, right? Really? How much does this clip-on wig cost? Considering your hair loss situation, it will require three stages. In total, it will cost around 2 million yen. 2 million? Three stages? Depending on the size, it will be about 400,000 to 600,000 yen. In addition, there will be a monthly trimming fee, which is 10,000 yen for men. A piece of 4 centimeters in length costs 5,000 yen. Considering your situation, it will be about 1 million yen per year. How long will it take? about 5 weeks. Around a month and a half. In total, it will take about 40 days By the way, to ensure a firm attachment, we'll need to shave off all of your hair. The time and money to change my life aren't enough, huh? Fast, affordable, and good quality - we make wigs for you. Who are you? I came here for a wig. Excuse me. Come in. Welcome. Yes. And thus begins my tumultuous wig-filled life. Movie Title: Kazura. Hello. It usually takes about a month to do this in a big company, but I can do it quickly over here. It will be done soon. Really? Time waits for no one, huh? Once I had the idea, I wanted to wear the wig immediately. I have one more question. It must be so, right? Surely, you're wondering how a small private shop like mine can do it so quickly, and if there's any issue with the quality. Well, yes, that's about right. It's precisely because it's a small shop that I can make independent decisions and keep costs down. That's why I can design and produce cheap and good wigs promptly. Ouch, that hurts! Ah, some hair follicle cells have died, and the hormones have transformed into harmful ones. Your hair loss started in the second year of high school, right? You've been suffering. I actually studied at BOUOU, the most famous wig manufacturer in Japan. I underwent rigorous training there before becoming a wig stylist. Back then... Ah, let's not talk about it. Mr. Owada, please make a wig for me. You want me to make a wig for you? Yes. Then how much can you pay? How much? Well, at our shop, the price is up to the customer to decide. how much can you pay? Um... No, ah, 220,000 yen. that... Could you stretch it to 250,000 yen? how old are you? 35 years old. Then it's 350,000 yen. Is it based on age? Yes. 350,000 yen, I'll leave it to you. Alright. Wait a moment. Don't move. Are you making pizza? As expected, it's a pizza. It's done. This is your new hair. New hair? Impressive. It's really hair, just like real hair. It looks so natural and amazing. From today, these five traits of your new hair will be reflected in your appearance, which is the key to your success. they will protect you and support you. I'll explain the specifics later. From today, you are Katsura. [Note: Katsura sounds the same as the word for "wig" in Japanese.] Katsura? I don't like the ending with "ra." Then let's call you Katsuraji. That's a unique name. Let's go with that. Listen carefully. Wigs aren't omnipotent, but if used correctly, they can make you feel comfortable and confident. No one will stare at my head; that's normal. Gently wash, gently wash, it's really impressive. So, from tomorrow, I'll rely on you. This project is a crucial step for our construction company. I hope we can win the bid for the Sakurazuka high-rise building. To ensure our success, we've invited a capable colleague, Mr. Moriyama. The wig's biggest enemy is "people." For example, the hairline here To avoid drawing attention to it, you should keep your chin up like this in front of others, like this No matter how anxious you are, the most important thing is not to touch your hair unconsciously in front of others. be natural. Now, let's hear a few words from Mr. Moriyama. Moriyama! Ah, yes. Let me introduce myself. I'm Shigeru Moriyama from the Nanzan-Yamanashi branch. I hope to work together with everyone to make this project successful. Please take care of me. Please take care of me. Excuse me, Mr. Moriyama, are you single? Huh? Ah, yes. Look at that gesture, so spirited. Miyuchi... You should learn from Moriyama as well. Look at his hairstyle, so dignified. No, it's fine. I've always been like this. What are you saying? Be serious. Yes. Um, I'll go to the bathtroom for a moment. They've noticed something is wrong for sure. Ah!!! The seam is crooked. What should we do? What should we do? It can't be fixed, can't be fixed. This... isn't right. Why am I wearing a wig? Why is my hair so thin? Hey, hey. You want to take off the wig, right? Mr. Owada? It's okay. No one doubts your hair. You need to show confidence and be open about it. How did you know? Haha, users of Owada wigs are everywhere. Wherever I go, I keep an eye on you. Alright, put your hand on the wig and take a deep breath. So, to celebrate Moriyama's arrival, cheers. Cheers. Moriyama, I'm looking forward to your performance. Thank you. this... Is it a wig? I always found it strange, Minister Kirishima. Kirishima? The infamous strict head of the personnel department. That person must be wearing a wig. That's quite troublesome. I didn't notice either. Me neither. just be What makes you think he's wearing a wig? intuition. Intuition can tell? It just looks very unnatural. How is it unnatural? It just is, okay? Please don't be so vague. Can you clearly explain? Eh? What do you mean? no i'm just curious. I'm sorry; the yam and potato salad haven't been served yet. Here it comes. Sorry for the wait. Let me wipe you clean. Don't move. Ah, excuse me for a moment. Oh, you're here. People like you should never let their guard down. Speaking of which, it's really firmly attached. We need to figure out a solution quickly. Ah, this is... A spare wig. With this, I can rest assured. Give it to me quickly. Now, on a special sale for 286,800 yen. Huh? Are you selling it? You can pay in installments. Only 8,000 yen per month. I'll buy it. In installments. Thank you for your patronage. Socks for 800 yen. I don't want that. Please hurry. Good. First day wearing a wig. My mind and body feel uneasy. I wonder if people who wear wigs are scared of strong winds Actually, even in strong winds, it won't get blown away. But after wearing a wig, I realize messy hair is scary too. During my honeymoon trip to Hong Kong, I kept wearing the wig a secret from my wife. I also wanted to see the night view from above. I also wanted to see the night view from above. But the helicopter's spinning propeller was too much for me. So, there was only one solution. That's to drink the raw water that someone told me never to drink. Ah, what's happening? Are you okay? I can't handle it anymore. Ah! Helicopter, you go alone. Huh? Good morning, I'm Morita Masamitsu. Currently, due to the low-pressure system over the Sea of Japan moving inland, Kanto region will experience strong southerly winds, resembling the early signs of spring (Haru Ichiban). As a climate, it's quite pleasant, but please be careful not to have your laundry blown away. In the face of strong winds, the most important thing is to avoid the headwind. Like F1 race cars, hide behind the car in front to reduce wind resistance. When there's no windbreak, dynamically evade the headwind, understand the direction of the wind dynamically, yes, dynamically evade the headwind. If you can't avoid it at all, face the wind with your hair's seams aligned to the wind's direction. Let the wind pass through, pass through, pass through... Ah, yes, become one with the wind. (Sakuragaoka Condo Design Team) Oh, just starting, huh? If necessary, let's go to the site. Seeing it in person gives a better understanding, a more vivid impression. No problem. We have so many photos already. We already know what the place looks like. Is that so? Then, it's up to you. Actually, I can't wait to go to the site. There's only one reason why I don't want to go outside. The spring breeze is really strong. It always blows so fiercely. Walk carefully and watch your step. Are you alright? Ah, thank you. Oops, the eggs are broken. It's fine. We need to crack them open when we eat. I want to make egg fried rice. I love it too. Huh? egg fried rice Ah, I see. Ah, sorry, thank you. ah thank you Goodbye. Tokyo Girl. Everyone, take a look. This is the newcomer from the Second Design Department, joining our row housing project. Makita, we have another reliable helper. I'm Ryoko Makita. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Moriyama, the two of you should work together on the design. You're the one from last night... Hello. Is the egg alright? Yes, I made it into egg fried rice and it was delicious. I had some too. Huh? I suddenly had a strong craving for it. Ah, is this the housing design drawn by Mr. Moriyama? Yes, I'm still sketching it. Because there's a big river on-site, I want to utilize the environment to create a refreshing feeling in the design. What's wrong? There's a pleasant east wind blowing in the morning from that direction. Would it be a problem to make the windows on the east side larger? In addition, these houses on the west side would be blocked. After sunset, the lighting will quickly become insufficient. If we follow the usual lighting design, it might affect people's lives. believe you know that site visits are the basis for design. I've been observing the site for the past three days. Excuse me, h as Mr. Moriyama been to the site yet? Not yet. I heard that we're supposed to work together with outstanding designers to come up with innovative designs, but I'm quite disappointed. Ah, Ra-Ti. From Keiji directly to Ra-Ti, huh? Let's put that aside for now, Mr. Owada, these are... Ah, like my little private shop, if I don't find a way, I won't be able to keep it open. Come on in and have a seat. Oh, here's... Come on in and have a seat. Ah here? Good evening. What's wrong? Do you have someone you like? You figured it out, huh? I often have people coming to me for love advice. You're really good at that. So, what should I do? Yeah, it's tough. Based on my experience, the clients who came to me until now... Excuse me. please come in. The heel of my high-heeled shoe broke. Welcome. What's wrong? Can you glue it back? No problem, it'll take just 10 minutes. Really? We currently have a wig client consulting. Please have a seat and wait for a while. Sorry for the inconvenience. - Yes. - No worries Alright, thank you for your trouble. In that case, what if she happens to like bald guys? Ah. If that's the case, you should immediately confess to her and then wait for her to like you more. But I can't bring myself to ask. How about casually showing her photos of bald actors as a test? That won't work. She said she really likes Kenichi Matsuyama. Then your looks are not her type at all. Even though that's true, I still want to be in a relationship with her. Even though that's true, I still want to be in a relationship with her. Huh? What's her name? Ryoko. Then why don't you try saying, "I want to be in a relationship with Miss Ryoko"? Ah. I'm asking you to say it, "I want to be in a relationship with Miss Ryouko." Why? Just confirming. When you speak your true feelings, it triggers oxytocin secretion in your brain, and wigs can react to that. Wigs can move? Occasionally, there are people like that; their scalp moves. Hmm. So, before you say it formally, make sure you confirm. Wigs can be dangerous. Then, try saying it here. Say it here? Yes. I want to be in a relationship with Ryoko... Sorry to interrupt. Do you have kelp for making soup? There's radish kelp on the left. I don't see any. It might be inside. I'll get it later. Please come in and wait for a moment. We are currently talking to a wig customer. Oh. A wig customer. Good evening. Good evening. Please sit here. Ah, okay. You've been waiting, RA-TI. Let's confirm it then. confirm what? (Shh~) I want to date Miss Ryoko. Great, no problem. You're here. I apologize for yesterday. I spoke out of turn. No, Miss Ryoko is right. The most important thing can only be understood on-site. It's really a great place. Yes. Yesterday, we discussed Miss Ryoko's idea of having a large window on the east side. Is that so? But I don't plan to do that. Huh? Instead, I want to have a big terrace facing the south. During summer evenings, we can have dinner there with the family. I see, so it's designed with activities in mind. If we both work hard together, we can build a great house. Let's do our best together. These prices are a bit different, right? Yes. Then let's confirm this one a bit more. Sure. These three options should be fine, right? Yes. Hmm. Should I also take these? No need. But... It's fine. I'm sorry. Mr. Moriyama, please have a seat. Alright. Be careful of the lighting above; wigs can reflect and create a halo effect. I shouldn't sit, Miss Ryoko, you sit instead But Mr. Moriyama, you're carrying so much stuff. It's really not a problem. Please sit. Ah, just a moment ago, it was sunny. The rain is quite heavy now. Water can make the hair and base slightly visible. Especially the hairline, it's easy to expose. Let's go, the client is still waiting. Why do you have two umbrellas? Because I thought Miss Ryoko might not have one. Thank you. It's starting to take shape. Aren't you both feeling cold? Fire up, but be careful not to sweat. The skin becomes damp, but the hair stays dry. It might look unnatural, right? What are you doing? We said it's very cold, didn't we? Sorry, Miss Asami. But I want to design in an environment close to reality as much as possible. Ah, sorry for making everyone feel cold. Ryo, we've asked you several times already. For this project, we hope Mr. Oeikawa can handle the lighting design. We're definitely counting on you. I know, I know. I'll take good care of it. President, is it okay like this? It's fine. What's not good about it? Ryoko and I have always had a good relationship. Right? Come on, take a cigarette. No, I... Hold it with your index and middle fingers. Come on, come on... I understand that it may take some time to get used to things here since you just transferred. But that's how business in Tokyo is. You seem distant, Ryoko. Come here. Isn't it a bit too much? Instead of worrying about such things, focus on your work. Yes, you're right. Take a puff quickly. Hey, lower your head. Pay attention to the actions of others within a 70-centimeter radius. If someone grabs your hair, it's over. I said no touching! Ah, that was quick. Did you see their expressions? I'm sorry, I couldn't proceed with the discussion. It's okay. I don't want to collaborate with that kind of company anyway. Really sorry. Mr. Moriyama, why do you do this job? Huh? Why are you suddenly asking this? Well, it seems like you've always enjoyed your work. Ah. Actually, there's no particular reason. I just believe that home is an essential place. No matter what happens outside, you'll eventually return home. It's a place that provides protection. Mr. Moriyama's childhood home must have been lively and warm, but rather than lively, it was more noisy. My home is quite the opposite, as my father is rather reserved, which is why I developed the same desire as Mr. Moriyama to create a warm house where family can gather. I believe Miss Ryoko can make it happen. Thank you. Is there something you need? There's something I've been wanting to ask. Why? Is it alright? yes. Could it be, Mr. Moriyama... Is my wig exposed? Is it type AB? Is your blood type AB? Yes, yes, that's right. I knew it! How did you know? You're usually seems calm, but sometimes he suddenly explodes, like just now. I see. Let's go drink and sing together, have some fun. Ah... Later, she told me that her favorite genre of drama is historical fiction, especially this one. My favorite is (Note: It's a Japanese historical fiction manga set in the martial arts world.) Getting closer to a woman makes you feel happy, but it also marks the beginning of new hardships. Why is that? For instance, if you ask her where she wants to go on the next date, and she answers she wants to go to Disneyland, what would you do? Can you ride roller coasters with a wig on? Can you brave the rapids with your wig on? I managed to avoid Disneyland somehow, I told her, "At my age, how can I go to Disneyland?" she suggested going to a hot spring for a night. It was so comfortable, I was constantly worried about being exposed, and I didn't feel comfortable at all. I could only wash my hair in the restroom. and I couldn't even blow dry the wig wet from the hot spring. Mr. Koda, are you feeling better? I'll be fine soon, I'll be fine... Ah, an amusement park? Yes, someone gave me tickets. How about going together this Sunday? What do you think? I'm not too fond of those amusement park rides that make you scream. Are you afraid of riding them? It's not that I'm afraid, when I do, my stomach hurts. Then let's not go to the amusement park. It might be boring for you to go with me. In that case, I'll return the tickets to the person. Oh, let's go together! To the amusement park. But you said you couldn't go. I was just kidding. Of course I can go! Can you ride roller coasters then? Yes, I can. I love thrilling rides like that. Really? That's great. Here you go. You actually believed me earlier, right? Yes, I did. You got me. Alright, we have a problem. Pressing on the wig all the time would be suspicious, and I can't wear a helmet either. Actually, you're already wearing one. Alright then, let's do an enhancement. Enhancement? Yes. What's this? It's a gel and double-sided tape for wig enhancement. Tonight only, it's on a special offer for 2500 yen. Can I really get it this cheap? No problem. But you need to be mentally prepared for using it. What do you mean? First, you need to shave off the hair on the clip to securely attach the wig. Ah... Actually, this is relatively good news. Listen carefully, the result of real and fake hair sticking together is that the pressure on real hair becomes greater, so in the worst case, the remaining hair might also fall out. Hair... all fall out? So, what do you want, her hair or her? Hair or her? Hair or her? hair is still her - hair. - oh! Hair... can be sacrificed. Um, how should I respond? Seems like I raised my voice a bit, sorry. First, stick double-sided tape on the top of the head with the highest force. Then, from the outer circle to the center, put glue every centimeter. After preparing, wear it on your head and press down firmly. I can do it for sure! Mr. Moriyama seems a bit different today compared to usual. Really? He seems so full of confidence. Haha, you're overthinking it. Hey, that one's amazing. I want to sit on it. Sure, go ahead and sit. I'm so nervous. Wow, it's so high. Look, Mr. Moriyama is really tall. [Note: Ryoko called Moriyama by mistake] Ah, it's high, very high... You're really good! After using this glue reinforcement, it can withstand wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, but if it exceeds this limit, I can't guarantee it. Look, look, it's incredible! Oh no, it's all over. It's so much fun, are you okay? It's over, it's all over. Why are you making that expression? Huh? Expression? Ah, how? (Bill: Wig money, home service fee, ticket) (total 348,800 yen after tax 362,040 yen) Great, this is really great! Why are you crying? Are you scared? No, I'm happy. If you were scared, you shouldn't have ridden it. I told you, I'm not scared. Shall we ride it again? No, absolutely not. I feel a bit cold. The house model is complete. Let's applaud once again. This one doesn't look good. This one is good. This one? Yeah, good. - This one? - Let's buy this one. I want a hat. - Try wearing the hat. Try it. - You try it. Try, try. I don't want it. I look bad in it. - It's okay. - Oh, this one is not for sale. Bullseye. Ah hit Bullseye. Wow, that's impressive. Very impressive. Well, this one should be good. The height of the table. Oops, it fell. Thank you for taking me back. Want to come up for some tea? Maybe next time. Then, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. why do you look dissatisfied Isn't the relationship going well? Are there any troubles? Hiding her about the wig always feels like lying to her. Feeling sad. Then just confess quickly, isn't it better? I want to, but I can't do it. Why? I don't know either. Really cowardly. Actually, I've been wanting to ask, who is this? Oh, she's the female manager. Oh, let me take you to meet her. It's fine, over here. Is this not a good place? If it's not, I won't go. This place... Good evening. Ah, hello, hello. Hello. What is this place? This is the Wig Enthusiast Club. Wig enthusiasts? Everyone here wears wigs made by me. But because we can't talk about wearing wigs with others, we feel really sad. To relieve this pressure, we come to this wig enthusiast club. Since everyone wears wigs, why don't they take them off when they come here? Probably because they don't want to see themselves without wigs, and they don't want others to see them either. Think about it, and you'll understand. I see, that makes sense. Ah, feel free to share your troubles or joys with everyone here. If you don't want anything, just go ahead and do it. Membership fee is 20,000 yen. Hello, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, I'm Tamura. Nice to meet you... Oh, Miyauchi. It's quite surprising, right? Do you also wear a wig? No, please call it "new hair," "new hair." I can't tell at all. (Owada "Moriyama is in danger") So, you've been protecting me from the shadows all this time. Thank you. It's nothing. It's only natural. Because I'm bald on top, they call me "Xavier." [Note: Xavier , the missionary who introduced Christianity to Japan, had a Mediterranean hairstyle.] Because none of my brothers have much hair, the neighbors call us the "light bulb brothers." I'm called Frankenstein. Oh, and they also call me "Moai Statue." [Note: Moai Statue, stone statues on Easter Island.] Moai Statue? Uh... Are these nicknames related to their facial features? In other words, is it not just about hair? Are there any others? Does Batou Kanon know? what is that? Tamura, 12 years of wig-wearing, a sales representative. It's said that his sales have increased by 20% since he started wearing wigs. To prevent the wig from being discovered, he does these stretching exercises. If the wig is raised higher, it becomes less visible to others. Yamanaka, 5 years as a software engineer. His posture improved after wearing a wig. During H-time, pay attention to the other person's hand movements. If their hand gets close to the hair, respond immediately. Koda, 9 years as a traffic coordinator. It's quite a challenge to wear a helmet over a wig. Actually, I used to have a girlfriend I was about to marry. The wedding venue was booked, but before the wedding, I told her about the wig, and then... And then? The wedding was called off, and she accused me of deceit, demanding 1.5 million yen as compensation for emotional distress. 1.5 million? Seniors, if you don't want to break up with Miss Ryoko, don't tell her the truth. Women won't understand our struggles. The bidding results are taking so long to come out. It's already past the scheduled time. Did we fail? Minister, don't say that. ah sorry. Hello, I'm Tomioka from the design department. Yes, the bidding results. Yes, the bidding results. Right, uh-huh. We won! We won! Minister, stop messing around. Ah, sorry, sorry. That's fantastic! That's great, Ryoko! That's amazing! Senior, you did it! That's great! Moriyama, well done, that's fantastic! Ah~ We did it! Hmm. I still can't believe it. I'm so happy. But even if we hadn't won, I would still be happy. Because we built the house we really wanted to live in, and it's not just one person's effort, but the effort of two people together. That's what makes me happy. Ryoko. Yes? What should I do? Can I kiss her? But before that, if you don't tell her about the wig... I can't do that. Oh. Ryoko I can't do it. I saw that. you saw it? Definitely. Indeed, it feels strange to continue this kind of relationship without any progress, but Moriyama's gentlemanly subtlety is also one of his strengths. Is it my problem? I think you still don't know, so I want to tell you something. You need to listen calmly. Alright. Actually, Moriyama... Have you decided to confess to her? Yes. Why, senpai? Exactly, you sure you've thought it through? There's no benefit in telling her the truth. But I've already decided. If I don't tell her the truth, I won't be happy. It's impossible for us to go any further if we keep hiding it from her. Do not have any regrets, okay? Mhm. But how are you going to tell her? I haven't thought about that yet. Gay? That's very likely. The kind who cares a lot about his hair and acts effeminate around handsome guys. I don't think so. Yeah, GAY should be like that. True. In any case, we must resolve this quickly. Resolve it... How about going to a hot spring? Work has also temporarily come to an end. Let's go together on the next day off. We should relax occasionally. Hot springs are our hell. Even if she invites you, you must not go. What do you think? Oh, when I want to take a break, I'll go back to my hometown. My dad's not in good health. The enemy will definitely try to deceive and stall. We must not give up now. Then I'll go too. Huh? Let's see your hometown, meet your parents. Is that okay? Oh, I see. Your mom makes the best Sukiyaki, right? This meat is delicious. (Telephone) Hello? Amao. How are you doing? Mhm, mhm. What? Please. It's an urgent situation now, my lifelong request. Why are you saying that? Why would I wear a wig? At least let him explain the reason. Stop babbling, never come back in your life, idiot! You old fool! Just wait a moment, let me check my dad's condition first. Hey. Wait, I'll be right back. Wait, Mr. Moriyama. Um, to the Shimo organization, please. Sorry to trouble you. Ah, brother. Oh. What's this? It's amazing. Don't touch it. It's so funny. I didn't wear it for a laugh. Dad, Mom, come and see! Please, Dad, Akira, Sanjiro, don't ask. Just put it on. put it on first Don't joke around. Who would wear this on their head? If this woman cares about this, maybe it's better not to date her. That's not it. This is for someone important to me. I'm planning to confess to her after this. If she doesn't like you just because you're bald, then she's just a shallow woman. Please, she's coming soon. I need to go pick her up now. I said it's not possible, it's not possible. At this age, is it okay for Dad to be bald? As long as I and Shigeru wear it, it's fine. It's not about that. It's about a person's inner qualities. What should we do? What should we do? What should we do... This place is really nice. Is it? Mhm. How's your dad? He said he wants to rest. Maybe it's better not to see him. - Sorry. - Is everything okay? We had a flat tire. What should we do? Let's walk then. It's quite far to walk. It's a bit far. This is my home. What a beautiful house. Ah~ You are here, I am Amao's mother. First time meeting, I am Ryoko Makita. I never expected my clumsy son could bring such a beautiful girlfriend from Tokyo. Sorry for the sudden visit. Not at all. Wait a moment. Everyone, come out. Ryoko is here. Hello. Dad. Welcome. Nice to meet you. Mr. Moriyama has been very kind to me at work. Likewise, please take care of me. Likewise, please take care of me. Is your uncle's health okay? What? Dad, weren't you feeling unwell? Are you okay now? He's much better now. Much better. Really? I was worried. I'm finally relieved. Please come in and have a seat. It's quite cold, isn't it? There's a small step over there. Be careful. Excuse us. Done. These snacks are delicious. Why is it so stuffy here? Sanjiro, is it? Ah, yeah. Maybe. No, my dad is probably a bit nervous, so he feels hot. By the way, Ryoko, there's a place nearby with lots of wild vegetables. Would you like to go pick some together? Sure, can I go? Of course, you can go. Great! Take care. then we go see you later. Take care. What are you doing, you idiot! I already said thank you to them. Hold on, hold on... Ah~ It's really nice. We don't get to eat this kind of vegetable much in Tokyo. Ryoko. Mhm? That boy is a very kind-hearted boy. Please don't abandon him. Why would I abandon him? He was raised with our indulgence. In the future, you may gradually discover some of his flaws. please be kind to him. I also have many flaws. No, even if he has a significant flaw, please forgive him for his kindness. What you did was deceiving. Alright. If you can't say it, let me say it. Okay, I'll tell her. Just leave it to me. Really? Thank you. You're welcome. What's wrong? Why do you look so serious? Ryoko. What? I have something to tell you. Okay. I... don't have... Huh? [Note: It also means "I don't have this thought in my mind."] Any hair on my head. There's nothing. There's absolutely nothing. I'm sorry for keeping it from you all this time. You never thought about marrying me? What? Pathetic. I never used to care about my hair. I still remember. Remember what? You always wore a hat on our dates. That's because I was afraid you'd feel embarrassed to be with a bald guy like me. Is that so? Ryoko, what's wrong? I'm sorry, it seems Mr. Moriyama doesn't want me here, nor does he want to marry me. Goodbye. Wait, Ryoko. What's going on? Shigeru, did you tell Ryoko the truth? I told her about it, so what? It's just hair loss, why should I suffer like this? Why did you have to make me bald? Why couldn't you give birth to a normal son? So, what did you actually say? I said I don't have any hair on my head. What were you doing? I was delivering a wig. Really? Yes. But even if I wear a wig, I might still get dumped. She likes you the way you are. Did you tell her, "I wear a wig"? I didn't say it like that. Huh, then how did you say it? I just said I don't have any hair. Then did you take off the wig while saying, "I don't have any..."? I didn't take it off. How could I? I didn't take it off. Then how did you say it? I just said I don't have any. Ah, when Ryoko ran out just now, she said, "You don't have any intention of getting married at all." Huh? That's what she said. That's what she said. It seems she misunderstood. Mr. Owada, thank you. Hurry up; if you don't make it in time, the car will leave. Oh no. Excuse me. RA-TI, go for it! Aren't you the manager? Wearing a wig is quite warm, actually. Yes, it is. So, how did it go? What's the honest result? I still don't know. I see. Everyone is very worried. Let us know when there's a result. Okay, got it. Goodbye. Alright, done. Ouch, it hurts, hurts. Thanks for giving us a ride. - Hey! - Sorry, I'll buy a ticket later! Ryoko! Ryoko!! Ryoko Ryoko! Ryoko. Ryoko Ryoko. What's up? Ryoko. I got on the wrong direction. Ah, right! The farther we go this way, the farther we are from Tokyo. Ryoko, I want you to know my thoughts. i'm a coward. I wasn't like this when I was little, but I don't know when I became so timid. Facing others' gazes and ridicule, although I try not to care too much, I still mind a lot. There are others with the same issue, and some people don't care at all. I try hard not to care, but I can't help it. but still not It may seem like a small matter, but I feel like I'm not acting like a man, and I despise myself for being so pathetic. After coming to Tokyo, I thought it was a chance to change myself, and I made efforts. Then I met you. From the first moment I saw you, I thought you were so beautiful. After being with you, I felt that I changed a lot, But at the critical moment, I hesitated again. I'm sorry. I made you upset just now, and I'm really sorry. There's something else I need to apologize for. I have something to hide from you. I am... am... I... I wear a wig. I know. Huh? I knew from the first time we met. You knew from the beginning? Mhm. so what? Even though I am like this, will you marry me? It might be a bit sudden, but I'll definitely work hard to make you happy. I love you. Let's get married and create a warm family together. You'll take care of me from now on. I love you too. That's wonderful! Wig operation success! Okay, thank you. What's this? False alarm. That's fantastic. So, what about this wig? It looks handsome on you. Just keep wearing it. Huh? Even without it, I love you. But now, it's a part of You. Finally, the wig brought me happiness. Expense for the business trip: 80,000 yen. Three wigs for his family. Oh wow, the total exceeds 2 million yen. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! By the way... Mhm? how did you know i wear a wig? Ah, the first time we met, didn't you squat down? Hmm. There was a lemon between the head and the wig. Really? What are you laughing at? Are you lying to me? Really? If it is true, there is a way to deal with it, right? By the way, can this be clipped in? Such a big thing can be clipped in that's fruit How can the fruit get in there?
