[all exclaim] During this time, the 2-D approach that emerged is one of the most recognizable styles of modern art. For today's challenge, you will have to make your model look like a piece of 2-D art. - Yay! - Yay! - Each case on the table contains a prop and a speech bubble that must be painted and included into your final design. Your models will be assigned by the case you choose, - and they will be posing - with your props in front of this backdrop to help create the feeling of a true 2-D piece of art. This is a waist-up design, including the face. You will have only three hours to complete your work. - We want to see a lot of personality here. - Should be vivid, vivacious, be fierce!

Something like that. - I'm excited about this challenge, because it's 2-D. - That was my graphic design - degree. It's easy for me to see art flat, and I'm really good at contouring and making those lines. Maybe I have a chance of winning this challenge. [upbeat music] - My first idea is a sarcastic tap on the shoulder to the old-school elegant male with the martini glass. Well, Luis has got a lot of his dots going. - Yeah, he's a dotter. - A dotter. 2-D art is a lot of dots and a lot of straight lines. - I'm looking at everyone else, - and they're doing dots. - I want my piece to be - something completely different. ♪ ♪ - Otto's using cakes! Hallelujah! We've brought him over to the other side! - My concept is '50s devilish pinup. - I want to stay away - from the airbrush, - because it doesn't - really work that good, - especially when you want - solid, crisp lines. This whole not airbrush thing is just so weird. I feel like I'm cheating. - [laughs] - Want some pink eyelashes? - Cute! - Right? - What's up, Luis? - How come you went with - green on your model? - Mine has to do with, like, - immigration and stuff. - Got to stand up for - our people, you know? - I feel you on that. - I was born in Mexico. When I was five years old, my parents migrated - to the U.S. because they wanted - a better opportunity for myself and for them. I did the Mexican color flags, and that's what I'm doing on my horn right now. - Out of high school, - I wasn't able to go straight into art school, because the money wasn't there. Winning "Skin Wars" would change my life. I would pay for school. - All right, you guys, - y'all better stop polka-dotting - around! We got 15 minutes left! - [people cheering] - ****. - Wow, that's cool. - I understand exactly what 2-D is. - Yours kind of looks - like a Ken doll. - I was in the top three in the last challenge, so I need to show what I'm made of - and that I do have - my own place in the spectrum of the body-painting world.

She got her ice cream, and it was a very hot day, so it started melting. - Aw! - "It melted all over my breasts!" [laughter] - Look at her teardrop; it's a giant gem. - I know; I wasn't - gonna use rhinestones and glitter for this one, because I was like, "2-D," but then I was like, oops. - [laughter] - You were like, "Oops, oopsie." - I think it's really clever how you did between her fingers black. Really gives the illusion of a drawn outline. - Thank you, Kyera. - Thank you so much. - This is David. He's a painter. He was running late, so he decided he was just gonna paint a suit on. - Rolling the competition into a big fat blunt. [laughter] - It's probably why - he was late. - Yeah, probably. Were you okay on time? - Yeah, make it - more challenging. Maybe an hour and a half. - Gauntlet thrown down, - Rick. - Yup. - I chose green, red, and white to represent the Mexican flag. When people stereotype immigrants, they automatically go for Mexicans. It represents for my people. - That shadow is very clever. That's the first thing I noticed when he came out. - Oh, thank you, yeah. - I love this - color combination. - You did a great job, - and I like how you did the lines on the megaphone too just to delineate that. - Hello. - "If I don't clean her pipes tonight, I'll hear a coy kitchen whine." - There's a few little riddles in there. - Please explain. - Yes, what is this? - It's kind of - a cartoon of myself. I grew up with all sisters and all women, and I was the one that would do - all the stuff - around the house. - Can you give us an example - of what a coy - kitchen whine-- - What's a coy kitchen whine? - "Coy kitchen whine" rhymes with which pop artist from that era? - Roy Lichtenstein. - There you go. - Well, this feels like - a confident painting. I mean, you really nailed this genre. - Thank you. - Thanks a lot, Hans. - This is the first time I've ever done anything like 2-D, - and I got to play - with the cakes. - I stayed away from the airbrush - as much as I could. - Have you never - used sponge before? - Not put it on for a full-body application. I learned a lesson through this. I'm happy with that. - I'm happy too. - Thank you. - So I remember the day that same-sex marriage got voted in - and everyone-- - like, "Did you hear? - Did you hear? - Did you hear?" - Have we got two faces? - No, I'd always thought about trying to do - a profile - in the opposite direction. I didn't have any idea if it was gonna work or not. - I admire you for - taking the risk. - Yeah. - Thank you, Alison. - Thank you. - All right, hey, Jess. - Hi. This drunk is, you know, the life of the party. But we don't see what happens behind the scenes to his family. - Tell us about the technique. - I actually went away - from the dots. I wanted to go with the very sharp color gradations that happen in the old cartoon style. - Great. - Thanks, Jess. - Thank you so much. - This looks like a nice twist. - So this is Harriet, and she is dating Hans's model. - Your model looks like a Swedish housewife with those amazing cheekbones. Those are outrageous! - Wow, painters, you've given the judges a lot to talk about. - We'll be back to announce - the winner shortly. - Bye. - Bye. - See you soon. Wow. - That was fun! - Yeah. - I really liked Kyera's piece. - Oh, Kyera's was fun. - It was so sweet, and technically I think it actually was one of the best. - It was poppy and fun to look at. - Yeah. - So what'd you think - about Luis? - For me, that was - the perfect marriage of great technique, great message. - It was pure, it was simple, and the saturation of color was beautiful. - And, man, he just had me - at that shadow. Really clever. - What'd you think - about Jess? - My favorite part of Jess's piece was the collection of colors on the chest. - You know, I thought it was - a perfect choice. - It was kind of risky - that she was the only artist that decided not to do the dots and challenged herself, "Can I pull this off without dots?" And I think she did. - I think so. - I don't think she needed 'em. - What'd you think about Hans? - Conceptually, completely bizarre, - but the painting - was very solid. The way that he did the bald cap, he was able to paint it so it really read. - So have you made your decision? - Yes. - Yeah, I think so. - Yeah. - Okay, let's go tell 'em. - All right. [tense music] - Hi, painters. all: Hello. - You've had three hours to create your artwork. Now it's time for the judges to announce their top three paintings. - I'm not trying to be cocky - or anything, - but out of all - the different pieces, my piece is the most 2-D today. - Hi, painters. - all: Hello. - You've had three hours to create your artwork. - Now it's time for the judges - to announce their top three paintings. Jess. Luis. Kyera. Congratulations, you have the top three paintings. Please step forward. - Ah, my piece, it is complete graphic everything. The challenge was 2-D, and I'm just pissed off. - Judges, thoughts? - Jess, you took a little risk not doing the dots like everybody else, but your results were wonderful. - I'm glad. - I don't like dots. - [laughs] - Kyera, I really loved - your concept. I loved the sweetness and the innuendo and the clever use of your ice cream cone as a prop. - Thanks. - Luis, you really rocked this style. The shadow on the arm, I loved it. - Thank you. - And the winner of this challenge is... ♪ ♪ Luis! - Thank you! - Congratulations. You're the winner! - When my name is called, I'm just like: [gasps] I can't believe it. - All I'm thinking is just, - "Viva Mexico," and it feels awesome! - This piece spoke from your heart. It was really fun to look at and also very moving. - Thanks. - Thank you, Cory. - Thanks, Cory. - In your first challenge, you conquered the art of 2-D design. Now it's time to take your work to another level, add dimension, and create a 3-D mural. [all exclaiming] - I do a lot of murals. That's what I do, and that's what I do best. I got this, you know. This is too good to be true. - A mural is usually flat, but the curves of the human body are three-dimensional. It's up to you to bring your mural to life. And for this concept challenge, you'll be adding one more thing: a partner. - Aw! - Nice. - That's right; you'll be working in teams of two. - I feel a little bit nervous about working in teams. - I don't know who I'm - gonna be paired with. I'm just kind of like, "Hmm, let's see what happens here." - Each team will turn four models into three-dimensional works of art, and you'll have five hours. One painter from the winning team will be our winner, and one painter from the losing team will be going home. Luis, since you won the first challenge, - you get to pick - your painting partner. - Jess. - Yes! - That was fast. - Yeah. I want to have the best team, and Jess is a very strong painter. I'm excited. - Okay, that's one team. - Now we have to sort out - the rest. Luckily, I've got my trusty paint can right here. I'll pull out two paintbrushes, and two names on them will become a team. Kyera and Alison. - Hi! - I knew it! - Michael, Brittney. - Yay, air five! - Otto and Tiffany. - Oh, wow. - So that means Hans and Rick. - Oh, yeah. - [laughter] - The two mural painters. - This is amazing. We both have a background in street art. - Rick and I are looking - at each other like, "Get ready." - We'll see you tomorrow, - painters. And remember, there's no "I" in "team." - But there is a "me." [laughter] Bye! - Good luck! [rock music] ♪ ♪ - Coming into this competition, - I was very nervous about working in teams - but couldn't be more thrilled - to work with Britt. I wanted to give him wings to fly high, and then the other artist can bring out their arms. - Michael starts spitting all darkness into light and I was like, "Oh my God, are you serious?" He's a little bit more on the quirky side. That's typically not my style. This will be interesting. - That'll be like the centerpiece of the owl. - It's a shadow on top of it. - Oh, yeah, there we go. - On the owl's head. - The basic idea of this is, we've got this giant frog, - and he opens his mouth, - and all the water comes out, and that makes everything green. - In the boot camp, you'll have your tents, training. Our concept, it's a storyline. There's a young soldier from boot camp. - Active duty. - Your hometown. - We have to create a 3-D mural, and we're gonna make it look 3-D by using shadows and highlights. - Like I said, we should do - a big scene - throughout - the entire thing. - I agree. - On the way over here, I just started missing my son so much. I just realized I feel so deeply lonely, you know? I'm just heartsick and homesick and missing my son. I don't want that to, like, subconsciously - sabotage what we're doing, - you know? - Alison is just having an emotional day. I'm gonna try to do my best to uplift her spirits, but I'm scared that she's gonna bring us down. I have a lot of positive energy going on, - and I've been at the bottom, - so I really don't want - to be there, so I'm going - to be holding your hand. I quit my job to be here. I have nothing to go back to. This is it. [upbeat music] - It's show time. This is us! - I love Michael, but I'm a bit worried, because I like to be in control of my own artwork. I've been in the top three twice. I know I need to make sure - that Michael just can't - hold me back. - Are you guys working with us? - Yes. - Nice, welcome. - Luis chose me as a partner, and I'm not surprised. I've won the Australian championships three times. I'm definitely one of the top body painters here. You're just putting your arm, like, across you a bit. We come up with this idea. It's from the perspective of a tiny fly who's going to potentially be zapped by this big bullfrog. So I'm hoping it's gonna turn out okay. - Hi! - Hey. - Hey. Otto. - Andrew. - Andrew? - The concept that me and Otto - have is "Off to War," which is a salute to all of our soldiers. We have to make this a very strong piece, because I don't want Otto going home; I don't want myself to go home. I would like Otto to go home another day, to be honest. You know, but now is not that day. - In the center of him is what? - It's just gonna be, - like, foliage peeking out - between the leaves - and the cocoon. - For our design, we just wanted to make up a whimsical story of the birth of a unicorn. Concept's great, but Alison is still emotional because she misses her baby. - I suddenly felt really, really lonely, you know? - I really hope she can hold it together. - I hope I don't have - to start over. I'm kind of nervous. - Just like that. I tattooed an owl on myself when I first started tattooing and it just fit perfectly - with the vision - that we had in mind. Our concept is rising above adversity and just realizing how powerful your knowledge is, and the owl represents knowledge. I'm killing it. - The frog should go, like, right here as well. My job on this one is the frog, and Jess is responsible for the fly. - Right here, I'm blending - the yellow, correct? - Well, what I would do is have a look at, like... - 'Cause look, - look at this one. Jess, you know, she likes to pretty much lead. That red does not look good. - What do you mean? I haven't put any shadows or anything yet. - I think you should - have done it with black. - I'm gonna do black after. - I'm nervous. The judges aren't gonna like this. - The airbrush looks - really sloppy. - Well, okay, yeah, but that was kind of the plan. You do the airbrush first. Luis is really stressed out, but between the two of us, - I don't intend to - go home this week. - Hey, Jess, I'm kind of worried I'm going home. - Stop it. [upbeat music] - We have five hours to paint four models as a 3-D mural. I feel like this is too small. Let me try some bobby pins too. I'm working on the caterpillar, and Kyera is working on the unicorn, but we're spending too much time on the bald caps, so I'm hoping we can get back on track.

I'm not sure what's going on, and it seems like they don't quite know either. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Luis and Jess. - Hello. - Hi. - It hit us that this is actually a competition. Pretty much, each challenge is this giant frog, and, like-- - We're a little fly. - We're the flies. - Who came up with the concept? - We kind of both did. - We both did, but we-- - We brought two separate ideas. - All right. - I'm getting you're the dominant force here, Jess. - No, I just talk loudly. - Because, Luis, - you seem like, you know, you could be a pushover. Are you worried about that? - No, I wouldn't want to work with him if he were a pushover. - You've got a lot of work done already. - Impressive-looking work. - Thank you. - Rick, how you feeling? - I'm feeling great. - What is the idea? - Can you share it with us? - Basically, the path from the streets to making your dreams happen. - Pretty much just the meaning - behind my owl just being the king of knowledge, you know? It's working good so far. - Who do you feel your biggest competitors are? - Oh, really? - You're working with him. - Standing right next - to him, are ya? - That's right. - Keep your enemies close.

[laughing] - We're still a little bare, - aren't we? - Yes. - We had to get the-- - The bald caps took forever. - You're telling me. Story of my life! - So our horned caterpillar's going to go into a chrysalis and then come out as a unicorn with butterfly wings. - What's going to be your biggest challenge today? - Time and - lining everything up. - And then we're gonna go in - with color. - Yeah. - Thanks, guys. - Wish us luck! - All right, painters, - thanks for letting us take - a little peek. - Now, remember, there's gonna be - one winning team, and there's going to be one losing team. And out of those, one of you will win, and one of you in this room will be going home tonight. Good luck, painters. - Bye. - See you soon! [upbeat music] - What if you open your mouth? Brit. - That's good. We're telling a story about this artist coming into his own, going from darkness into light. - Like this. - Michael, he's going to do darkness. I'm working on the light. - We're also just communicating telepathically. - Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Oh! I'm a bit nervous about it all coming together. I hope to God it makes sense. - Ooh, you got that airbrush skills. - How are you doing over there? - Pretty much almost done. - Really? - Yeah. - Shut up, Ricky. Don't even talk to me right now. - Rick always finishes quick. - He's a street artist, and - that's the name of the game. But his work gets a little bit sloppy. Okay, see, this is a little bit sloppy. - Well, you were the one - that did that line. - Um... Rick is only 20 years old, but I've been doing murals for 20 years. - Whatever he does, - I can just marry this whole piece together and make it great. [upbeat music] - Does it look 3-D? - [gasps] - Yeah, I need to pop - this one leg out. - I've been watching Kyera struggle with her piece. They're gonna be in trouble. - So does that look like a wing to you? [sighs] The image is there, but we need more time. I've done all that I could. I've done most of this piece.

I really want to beat Rick. ♪ ♪ - The owl makes me - feel proud of myself. It's my design. I hope the judges are able to just see that off the bat. - My favorite part of the piece is the unicorn. I worked really hard on that position to make it look like it was jumping out of the body, but overall I'm scared, because it doesn't - really connect with - the caterpillar. - My caterpillar looks great. It looks fun. It looks colorful. I really like my side. Kyera's unicorn was a little rough and not super well-rendered. I don't want to lose because of something that I didn't do. - I just really love - the gold leaf and all of these details, but it's the models' movements that really make it magical. - I love the way it looks cohesively, but I'm not liking my faces that I put on their bodies. I know my quality of work is a lot better than what I put out. It's a sickening feeling. - Looking at all the models together, I'm feeling good. I love the tongue idea. It's exactly what I wanted. And I didn't let Jess take full control of this mural. Definitely has a chance. - I spent a lot of time working on the fly, and it looks really very cool. The frog doesn't line up correctly. I'll have to wait and see what happens. - I like the tanks. I like the guns. Tiffany did an awesome job on the portrait, which represents those soldiers that didn't make it home. For the first time, - I'm not worried about - getting kicked off. To me, it just looks great. - Our models look so beautiful. I'm not 100% happy with the boots, but the rest of the piece is really good. - Okay, Hans and Rick, please step forward. - Our concept is about how we've made it here. It's called "From Dreams to Reality." - So you both have experience doing mural painting? - Yeah. - 20 years, yeah. - Well, I think that you guys really nailed it - as far as execution - of the challenge. It's just stunning. - So who did what on the piece? - So we kind of - designed it together. - I was focused on the owl, and Hans threw some wings on it, - and he did some building - on the bottom. - The skyline, it's just captivating to your eyes. And then that owl? - It looks like it's - three-dimensional. - Like, it looks like - there are layers. It is phenomenal. - Thanks so much. - Thank you. - That's awesome. - All right, square biz. Between the two of you, who should win? - It's not for us to decide; it's for you to decide. - If it comes down to that, I mean, I don't mind taking the win. [laughter] - So why should you win? - Well, see, now it gets more technical, you know? So I feel like I did a bigger part of the project. - Okay, thank you, Rick and Hans. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay, Brittney and Michael, - your turn. - This piece is about an artist who's afraid of darkness but faces his fears and seeks the universe. - Were you worried that - this was gonna be a bit much for your models, to take on three separate poses? - We wanted to go a bit above and beyond what everyone was doing and take a different approach. - Instead of having - a stagnant pose, we wanted our story to come to life in front of you. - Who did the center model's face? - Brittney. - I did. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. - This is a very theatrical piece. However, I think it's more cosmic than it is kickass. From both of you, I wanted to see a little bit more technique, something that pulled me in closer. - Okay, Brittney and Michael, - thank you. - Thank you, judges. - Thank you guys. - Okay, Luis and Jess. - So the whole concept is about that this is a competition, that frog being a huge challenge and each of us being that fly that's about to get eaten. - This piece reminds me of Nicki Minaj in that I like the bottom more than I like the top. - Oh! [dramatic music] - I pretty much painted the whole bottom. - Hang on a sec. ♪ ♪ - What'd you paint? - Oh! - I pretty much painted the whole bottom. - What? - And the crumbs. - Hang on a sec. - What'd you paint? - Oh! - So the thing - that you're saying to me is that you don't see the frog. - Me no like the frog. - Okay. But the guy that spent the most time on the frog was this guy. - The frog is the one part - where I'm like-- - I feel like my eyes and my brain - are working so hard. - Like, "See a frog. - See a frog." I'm like, what kind of frog are you? I don't know. - But I love how - the tongue comes down. Like, that part is so cool. - Jess, do you think that you should win today? - Um, I think I should. - I believe I should stay. - I was pretty much the brains - behind the piece. - [laughs] - All right, thanks, guys.

"America's number one, son!" [laughter] - Who can I blame for painting those faces? - Me. - I was rushing to get something - on the face so that it wouldn't be bare. - Speaking of faces, did you render both portraits? - I did. - Beautifully done. - Thank you. - This is something that's - so touching and powerful for people who have lost loved ones - or have grandparents - or fathers or friends - or anybody - who's fought in the war. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay, Kyera and Alison. [upbeat music] - Our piece is the whimsical story of the birth of a unicorn. - I love all the detail - that looks just like - an illustration - on the little-- - is that the horn - of the caterpillar? And of course I always love glitter anywhere. - Thank you. - I love you, by the way. - I love you too. - I want to like this piece more than I actually like this piece. I don't feel like you communicated or planned as effectively as you could have. It's just not working for me. - The unicorn is - supposed to be coming out of the chrysalis, but I think something got lost there. - Of the two of you, who should win? - I'm going to have to say me. - Alison, do you agree - with that? - Um... Overall, I feel like Kyera is so, like, young and vibrant, and I almost want to-- I almost feel like throwing myself under the bus if it came down to that, because I feel like Kyera should just be here. Like, this is so her. She's kind of on her upswing, - and I feel like I'm on - my downswing right now. I don't know. - That's ridiculous. If you can't sell yourself, then you're not gonna make it as a freelance artist in this business. - Oh, my gosh, did I make a mistake? I don't think I'm ready to go home. - Well, painters, that was pretty fantastic. - The judges have - a lot to discuss. Please head back to the lounge, and we'll call you back shortly. - [sighs] - That was rough, guys. - That was brutal. - Look, you know what? The work will speak for itself, - and that's what - is most important. - But you have to - stand up for yourself. - We're friends, and - we all get along, - but I didn't come here - to make friends. I came here to take that money home. - So, judges, what'd you think? - I love Hans and Rick. The owl, that was mind-blowing. - I was just-- just gobsmacked by it. - And it was the symmetry of the rest of it - that helped keep focusing - your eye back on that beautiful centerpiece. - And even how they did - the skyline, it was really cohesive. I liked it a lot. - That was Hans, and it was just - such a pleasing thing - to look at. - I got the sense - when talking to them that Rick was the real painter of the focal point. - Rick is kind of a soft-spoken alpha. - Right? - [laughter] - How about Luis and Jess? - I thought it was a beautiful piece, but the frog failed. - The frog was a failure, but the color scheme - and everything else about it, - I absolutely loved. - And the tongue, I really liked the tongue. - What'd you think about Michael and Brittney? - It was a mix of many different New Age elements, but it just needed more cohesion for me. - That was a little confusing. - The difference between the faces was a little bit jarring. - And the eyes were - very simple, - and I feel like it didn't look - three-dimensional. We didn't see details that could have been like, "Whoa, look at that wow factor!" - I don't know which one would be the bottom in that mini train wreck. - What about Kyera and Alison? - Do you know what - pissed me off? - Hmm? - Alison pissed me off today. - Oh, yeah. - What in the heck was that? Saying that "oh, she's younger." I just did not respect that attitude that she took. - I really did enjoy Kyera and Alison's piece. I loved the colors. - That caterpillar was very convincing, but there's just some little technical things. The water droplets, I wish that maybe they were a little more white or blue. - Kyera's unicorn, it was a technical mess. - Now, granted, a caterpillar is a cylinder. It's a lot easier. I mean, it's much more complicated to make a unicorn. - And it was in movement, with limbs coming at you, - where I think, like, - that is a challenge. - Mm-hmm. - The Tiffany and Otto piece, for me, felt like a mural. The actual story was cohesive. - I agree. - You knew exactly what it said. - You didn't even need it - to be explained to you. And that's the purpose of a mural. - So, judges, have you made your decision? - Yeah. - I think so. - Yeah. [dramatic music] - Welcome back, painters. - Hello. - Hi. - In this challenge, you competed in teams, and your 3-D murals came to life. Tonight, there can be only one winner, and one painter will be going home. Luis and Jess. You are safe, so you may head back to the painters' lounge. both: Thank you. - Otto and Tiffany. Hans and Rick. You are the top two teams. Congratulations. Please step forward. - Otto and Tiffany, your mural was passionate, and it made me proud to be an American. - Hans and Rick, it all worked, starting with the composition, the pose. Everything was executed perfectly. You should both be very proud. - Thank you. - Thanks so much. - Hans and Rick, congratulations. You're the top team. - Awesome. - Otto and Tiffany, you may head - back to the painters' lounge. - Thank you, judges. - Hans and Rick, one of you will be tonight's winner. - I know that I have more experience than Rick. - It's very important - for me to show everyone that I'm in this competition for a reason. - The winner of this challenge is... [tense music] - Hans and Rick, you both did exceptional work, but only one of you can come out on top. The winner of this challenge is... [tense music] Rick. Congratulations. - Yeah, I won. I love it. I'm officially a threat to everybody. - [sighs] - That feels good. [laughter] - Rick, that owl that you painted truly was the focal point of an extraordinary piece of art tonight. - Congratulations, Rick. - You and Hans may go back - to the painters' lounge. - Thank you, judges. - Congrats. - Great work, Hans. - Thank you, awesome. - Well done, guys. - What up, playas? - Welcome. - Michael and Brittney, Alison and Kyera. The judges thought your murals were the least effective tonight. - Michael and Brittney, I wanted more technique here. You spent too much time on the transitions and the theatrics without actually putting together a cohesive mural. - Alison and Kyera, - I know that you guys got off to a rocky start, and it did end up looking a little bit rushed. - Unfortunately, one of you will be packing your brushes tonight. [tense music] Michael and Brittney... ♪ ♪ You're safe. But the judges need to see better work from you--and soon. Please return to the painters' lounge. - Thank you. ♪ ♪ - I'm freaking out. I'm in the bottom. But if Alison is a woman of her word and she doesn't want to be here, she will let that be known. If she's two-faced and I end up going home - and she doesn't voice - her opinion, then everybody can see her character. - Alison and Kyera, one of you is going home. ♪ ♪ The judges have made their decision. Alison... ♪ ♪ You're safe. - [gasps] - Although your overall mural was lacking in technique and composition, the caterpillar and the tropical aspects - of your painting - were well executed. - [sighs] - Kyera. Unfortunately, you are going home tonight. - Kyera, the unicorn was not as strong as the caterpillar. It wasn't a clean rendering. - Alison, it's time for you to step up your work and get ready to fight. - Hell, yeah. ([sniffs) - Alison, you may head back to the painters' lounge. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Wow, Alison. Fake, everything fake. I'm heartbroken. - Kyera, I know in my heart of hearts, you're a star. You're a star, and I know stars when I see them. This is just the beginning. - Thank you. I've made it to a point where I never thought I could reach. I'm finally in LA, and I'm not leaving, and I'm not going back home. I feel truly blessed to have met all of you. Thank you all. - Kyera, it's time to wash off your canvas. - I'm disappointed. I wanted to make it till the end. I'm blessed and happy. I've already won a family, especially with Michael. - [sobbing] - Being a part of "Skin Wars" has been the best experience of my life, and I know that I can be proud of my work. - Fly high, little unicorn. Fly high. - Till next time. - Bye. - I'm going to pursue my dream in LA, and I'm excited that the world will see that I am a great artist, and this is only the beginning for a greater life that's about to be. [upbeat music] - Next time on "Skin Wars"... - There's gonna be a pageant! - Wait a minute. That's not a woman. [laughs] - The men are here. - Oh, [beep]. - Winning is the goal. - Exactly. - What is going on? - Luis? Yeah, he gonna howl. - Oh, ****! - 45 minutes, bitches! - Are you ready to crown Miss Skin Wars? - I thought you'd never ask. - I just want to win one challenge. Please just one.
