THE LAST WOMAN What am I supposed to do stuck at home for a month with the baby? You only think about yourself. What about me? I've got a wife and kid. Look, just forget about paid vacation. What we have here is a serious cutback. It's clear that October vacations is just a way to make us pay for the factory's problems. That way they decrease production and we have to take time off. They're using us like always. They send the workers home and then decide what to do. October vacation is a bunch of shit. You finally got it. But what can we do, tell me. They're all in agreement, bosses and unions, and so they screw us... The workers are right, there's no security for anyone anymore. You don't have balls, Gerard. Let's go into business for ourselves. Do you want to spend the rest of your life in this shitty factory? I grew up in this shitty factory, what else am I going to do? Shit. I believe in my job. The management here treats us like goddamned dogs. Gerard! Are you crazy? Get your hands off and watch your mouth when you talk to me. Get out of here or I'll kick your ass. That's 'engineer' to you. Well, engineer, why don't you take off and go home? You learn fast, you're a real credit to your kind. Is that so, engineer? You're always getting into trouble. Damn, my hand hurts! Quit complaining, what else could we do? I'm not complaining. I'm right, huh? They treat us like dogs. I think my wrist is broken. We always pay more than they do. Son of a bitch! I'm late, I've got to go pick up the kid. Taking a crap, huh? Nice. Here's daddy, Pierrot. What are you doing there? I picked him up because he was crying. You were crying? You're hungry, little one, come to daddy. Were you lonely? Oh, look at the nice toy. Can I play too, teacher? Look, she's stealing our doll. That's our doll. She's not going to give it back. Mama? Ah, come here. It's nothing, it's nothing. Get out of here, go bark at your master! See? Don't be afraid, I'm here. We're on vacation now. We'll stay home, the two of us. Could you give me a ride? Sure. Come with us. Are you afraid of dogs? No, I'm afraid of violence. These days even the children feel it. Well, I wouldn't know about that. I only have one kid. Yes, he's lovely. Where are you going on holiday? Mount Assiz. Where? In Tunisia. Good. How politically conscious of you. The sea, the sun... Why don't you stay on the home front with me? Because a friend is expecting me. Is he waiting for you outside? The two of you naked in the sun, eh? I'll give you a ride to the gate. Get the helmet. I always have an extra. You never know. Hop on. It's too bad, because I like you. Valerie! Choose - Tunisia, or home with me. Go! That's more like it. What was that? He's still following us. Here's your stuff. Let's hope this scene is brief. You're free to do what you want. I'll stay here alone with my pain. Goodbye, Michel. Will we ever take that trip towards the sun? You like it in the bath, huh? Where's his mother? His mother? She left. She flew off like a bird, right, Pierrot? And this is the legacy of the couple. The couple is history. It was hard. For two. Why did you get married? Wanna see his little pistol? Here, take him, have a look. See? His little willy. What do you think of daddy's willy, eh? Your daddy has to be your mummy. Dry him off if you want to, but I can't take care of him alone. I didn't learn anything from books. We both learned together. All set, Pierrot? Oiled and waxed. Now that we've taken care of him, we can take care of us. You have to be gentle with me. No, no, this isn't for you, it's for me, my dear. Now what do you want to do? Let's go take a nap. Come on, my little prince. Later I'll get you some food. I'm a little nervous. - What's your name? - Valerie. You're Gerard, right? How did you know? You're the only man who comes to get his child. You have to be gentle with me. Slowly... Pierrot, you'll eat later, knock it off! He always interrupts me when I'm about to come. See how quick your dad is, Pierrot? You yell and yell and now you won't eat. I'm hungry too. I'm hungry. - You're hungry? - Yes. Your belly's empty? I'll feed you. Now we'll dress up and then we'll go dancing. Let's do things right, eh? Lap it up. Are you crazy, giving him sleeping medicine? It's sweet, huh? One little drop won't hurt him. He'll sleep and leave us in peace. Do you always do this when you want to make love? After dancing we'll make love some more. Before I was too hot for it, too fast. It was still good. You'll see how good I am. The first time is always awkward. Good, you know your place. See, this is the hen, that's you. And this is me, the cock. No...that's playing with fire. Here, suck this instead. Let's be serious. Now we get dressed. I'll wear blue in your honour. That's for weddings. You know the tango is an expression of sex? - It gets you right here. - What's this, your mood music? Depends. Do we have to go out? Don't...don't... What's this? She must have gone. What was her name? Valerie? She stole my sweater. The blue one! Valerie! What's going on here? "Gone out." This is not good. She already thinks she's family. Look how practical. Come back here! Hi Gerard, it's noon! So what? She bit me all over. She's attached herself to the kid. Staying home without working, you start thinking about a lot of things. A man and a woman...make room... We have to communicate to understand each other. Succeed in communicating. You're not answering, you're not helping me. I hear the ocean. I want you...I want you. It's hard to talk, I know. Well, come on, then. You're right, I only think of myself, it's true. I'll change, you'll see. Stay, okay? You'll see that it'll be all right. You let me do what I wanted and we overdid it. I've rubbed myself raw. Poor little guy. Let's hope he gets well soon. What would we do without him? You can't take these little injuries lightly. You're right. How are you doing? Did you put something on it? I'm sorry, it's my fault. How's the roast beef? - Very good. - Good, huh? You know how to cook. It's my specialty. I'll have a bit myself. And now you'll cut your hand, too. I can't stand the sight of blood. Now we'll drop off the baby and go out. All right. It's claustrophobic in there. Finally I get to see you again. And with a beautiful girl too. You're lucky, I just made pasta. Want to have some? No, we can't. I just came to ask if Benoite could look after the baby. Notice anything different? Look at the switch. Let me introduce myself, I'm Rene. He's very rude, he never introduces his colleagues. Please, come in. We really don't have time, we're going dancing. What are you drinking? Whiskey? A small whiskey. - Miss...? - Valerie. What a beautiful name. What's your sign? Pisces. See, my dear, the carpet is still dirty. No, it's just the colour, it's sort of dirtyish. If you say so. How's it going, Gerard? Long live Free Chile. Long live Chile. Valerie, this is my friend Benoite. She's the one who watches Pierrot when I go out. More like a victim than a friend. You're very pretty. You like dancing? So why did we come? Anyway it's not bad here. You'll see, we'll have fun. Hey there, Moreno. Hi Gerard, how are you? Do you still have that great bike? Do you want to sell it? No. I need to talk to you. Can't you see I'm with someone? Come on, I'm not stealing you. A little less familiarity, eh? Do you want to tell me why you told everyone about my little curl? I forbid you to touch me or talk to me ever again. Little curl? Look... I told you not to touch me. Listen, who's shaving your pussy? Is it you or is it me? It's my body, I do what I want with it. Do you know our country? It's very pretty. Sun. Women. Music. All beautiful things. Moreno, come on. Be right there. ...just a little curl, one has a reaction. It's normal. I'm an adult and I do what I want. Well? A little edgy, huh? Come on, she's all screwed up. You understand, in eight months I couldn't be alone all the time. Come here, I'll show you something. Marilyn. You know her? For me, this is Woman. She's the only one who can make me dream. Again with the Marilyn Monroe story? Belt up. Stop your yapping. I wanted to say that this woman, just like you, is different from all the others. For me it was an obsession. There were nights when I would come here only for her. I never wanted a woman so much. - She's dead. - Yeah. If she were here tonight would you let me make love to her? And you quit it. You know what I'll do to you? I'll get ahold of your tits and pull 'em off. Delinquent. Michel, please don't hate me. Why do you want me? Ah, don't cry now, not that... All right, I'm coming. Gerard, I need a taxi. Because he's crying? Don't be cruel. When a guy cries, I'm the taxi. I'll give you a ride. Now they've even put on music. And I'm down here like an idiot. It's raining. And you're leaving. Raining and leaving. Michel, help me close the trunk. There's some bags. Shouldn't you have gone home? What are you doing here? Do you know what time it is? You like games? You know what you are? - A bitch. - Quiet, you. - Hands off! - Ah, shut up, Michel. If you need me I'm always here for you. My love. Just like his father, just as bad. Thank goodness. Want something to eat? No, she ruined my appetite. Aren't you gonna kiss me goodnight? Is this good enough? Who was that? Gerard, he came to get the baby. Goodnight. We don't need her, we're fine on our own. Yeah, shoot me, good. Should we go to sleep? Mama! I know, but mama's not here, only daddy. Who is it at this hour? Did you pick up Pierrot? Just what are you doing here? Open up. Let me in. Get lost. Open the door. Shut up, you'll wake up Pierrot. Are you crazy? Me crazy? And you're not? You spend the whole night with some guy... ...who kicks you out in the end. I had to talk to Michel. We left things badly. I understand that, this has nothing to do with jealousy. Got anything to eat? You think this is a hotel? Four hours of talking. That's some conversation. Talking all night. And I'm waiting downstairs like a jerk. Huh! Look at that, just as if she was at home. Go ahead and fuck who you want, that's OK, but take your stuff and get out. Michel acted better than you and he's the one that I left. Don't eat the baby's food. And don't sit there like a mummy. You want to keep the noise down? These tapes are much better than yours. If it weren't for the neighbours you'd be out on your ass right now. I would have just come back. Since now I've decided to live with you. Just one problem with that, I like living by myself. And now I'm going to jerk off. You're some sight, Gerard. Piss off, I can't concentrate with you standing there. This is my home and my bed, you got it? I can't do this. Look, you woke him. Why don't you hurry up and go to Tunisia? I don't want to see you, I don't want to hear you, I don't want you. Poor thing, don't think, just try to sleep. You're right, how can you sleep? And don't touch me. Move over, you're touching me. Would you like to hear that you're different from all the others? That I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you? Is that what you want to hear? She's asleep! Selfish bitch. She sleeps. It would be easy to lie my way out of this. I love you, I want you, I like to be with you. But I'm not going to do that. Where is he? He went out just to spite me, as usual. It's 10 and he hasn't even washed or changed him. I forgot about the usual sidekick. If it's not one, it's another. Here's the prize so open your mouth and close your eyes. Here you are, nice warm water. He shit up, he shit down! I've been looking after this kid for 300 days and I know what I'm doing! Want a smoke? You just can't get any sleep around here. Now your father's true colours are showing, huh? Did you put the lotion on? You didn't wash him properly, he'll get a rash. If you don't want him to get a rash then use a clean sponge, not that one. Hey, for eight months I've done just fine. Come on, Pierrot. Yeah, go to daddy. Okay, you can go now. Go on, take off, you're not the mother here anymore. He doesn't need you anymore and today I won't give him to you. Take your bag and fuck off. What did your mother have to say about that shit?? Well done, Pierrot. How long have you known him? A few days. I've known him a bit longer. Liar! You don't know me at all. And what about you, did you ever try to know me? Here we go, same old story. Ah, shut up. Do you want some advice? Get out while you can. Don't listen to her Valerie, she's just jealous. Enough, Gerard, come out and give her the baby. I feel sorry for you. You want to live with this egoist? Poor thing. It's not your fault. Look at that innocent face. She's in love. It's infatuation. You still here? He's mine! I lent you that baby. Ha! "Lent"? And who gave birth to him? And whose seed was it? You can find seeds anywhere. I don't even know why I'm talking to you. Open the door! Why don't you call your daddy to come open it? "Their son". Once a week he's "your son" and the rest of the time he could be dead. Here, take this with you...or isn't it big enough for you? Here we go, this one's just right. And there you have it. The anti-aesthetic affirmation of phallic superiority. Phallic! This is your problem, right here. You'd love to have a big one all to yourself. You stupid exhibitionist. Gerard! Leave him alone! See what she did to me? She's not completely wrong. So you're on her side, huh? What she's criticizing you for isn't wrong. You men are possessive and selfish. Selfish? Me? You don't know what you're talking about. If I was like that we wouldn't be together. I never said I wanted to live with you forever. Don't eat my dick, you cannibal! And now let's get out of this madhouse. See you. Did you see how she acted? She's certifiable. She's jealous of us. You're completely different. Right? What's the matter? Nothing. What have you got to cry about? If anyone should be crying it's me. I don't understand what you all have to complain about. I'm the victim here. Body heat is important for babies. They need physical contact, or else they'll get sick. He needs to feel that he's loved, don't you, my little Pierrot? A little love makes him feel more at ease. And how about me? Don't I need a little body heat? You're right. We shouldn't forget to touch each other. Scratch right there. A white hair. It's the beginning of the end. Come here, Pierrot, come over to daddy. It's old age. I have to warn you, Valerie isn't like the other women you screw. What are you telling me this for, I haven't done anything. Not yet, so don't even try. Stick to your little-curl-girl. You're wrong about her, she's great. I know all about her. Do you know the latest? She put a bow on it. I know, I know, don't go on. She's not my type. It must be serious, then. I don't have the key for this lock. Let me have a look. Call yourself an engineer? You can get that open with a bobby pin. I won't take you as a partner anymore. You really think I'd try to steal her? I respect serious relationships. You think looking for the ideal woman all your life is a lot of fun? Screwing around, always screwing. If only I had found love. I want love. You're sick of screwing? Sick of it, no, but like the man says, "screwing, always screwing". This weekend I did five. As a result I don't have fun anymore. Just ends up like drinking a glass of water. There you go, engineer. I didn't want to break it, I just wanted to open it! After some hard work at engineering, a banana. Listen, do you mind going now. I've got to sort out this stuff. Yeah, sure. What should I do, go get you a wedding present? Enough of that crap, I already got married. Here's my boy. Come to daddy. - Let me take that. - Thanks. You two went for a walk? I bought some wool to make him a sweater. Ah, a sweater, great. Well, I'll see you later then, Rene. You went through my things? I was just opening it for you. Rene's the one who broke it. Hey, wait a minute, I only did it because he said he lost the key. I was just trying to help out. The baby's wet himself, you'd better go change him. So, Rene, you were on your way out. You'd better feed him too. We'll take care of the baby and see you later. I have the impression she's not happy. Go screw her. Thanks for the suggestion. Do you want to leave, finally? Yes, I am a prevaricating male. Change the baby and then we'll go eat. The baby's yours so you can change him yourself. You're perfectly right. He's my flesh and blood. You're mine because you're my seed. And now I'll clean up your crap. I forgot the tanning mirror. Oh, I've messed up your carpet. If you have problems with Gerard, come and see me. I forgot the mirror. You still here, Rene? What do you want? Need any help? I'll take care of it. Go on back to your wife. So what do you want me to do, turn myself into the police? Yeah, daddy's coming. Who are you calling? I'll do what I want and call who I want! You think you can hurt me? I was trying to be nice. I'm going for a walk. And when I come back I don't want to find anyone here. Not you, not your trunk, not anyone, not anything. That's right, the first one left and the other one is leaving now. Like a cherry? Oh, I didn't notice your face. Would you like some cherries? There aren't any cherries here. No cherries? Well, what are these, then? Nuts? Where did you get them? You can get everything in this place. There's all four seasons here. 400 lira for quarter of a pound. They must be good if they're that much. That's a good one. You know why you're my type? Because you're more than pretty, you're sweet. Yeah, really. What do you think about me? Average. You know. Nice enough. Friendly. That's it? Yep. How do you see me now? Excuse me, I think you've got the wrong baby. That one's mine. He's so cute I don't know if I can give him back to you. Come on. I think he's wet. Let me introduce myself. I'm Michel. You can't come to my house, there's a slight problem. Which is? Jane. She looks like Marilyn Monroe, don't you think? And you look like Bogart. How long have you known her? Since yesterday, but it's not serious. There's an apartment across from me. It's free now. So why did you come here? Because you needed me. You know if you need me, I'll be there. It's a dump, but very convenient. Michel? Send her away. She only speaks English. I'm not some package you can pass around. I do what I want. Valerie... Be reasonable. Don't grab on to me. Excuse me, but what did you do to her? Nothing. I just opened her trunk. I was going to put her stuff away. Women are very delicate, but they can also get hysterical. Are we playing hide and seek? You can't do anything, so see you later. She's probably right, Michel. She calls you and then you show up with Marilyn Monroe. It's your fault, not mine. Is it? It's obvious that you can't live with him. Is that right? When you're ready, we can go. You two need to sort out your problems somewhere else. Come on, I'm busy here. Go on! You're all the same. You're shit. Shit! Shit! Very refined. Hey, where are you going? That's my kid. Listen, if you take the son then you have to take the father, get me? We'll be going now. Tell me how much you spent for... Valerie! Staying or going? Gerard, Pierrot needs something to eat. See you Michel. Please excuse all this. That's okay. Can I talk to you for a moment? I'd like your opinion about Valerie. Do you want something to drink? - Got any Fernet? - Sure. Will you be nicer when you're big? It necessary to redefine the laws that govern the relationship between a man and a woman. As you know, men are the ones who made up the rules. And now they're anachronistic, even anti-historic. Anti-historic? For example, we didn't respect women's sexuality. We invented it for ourselves. It was our image of them. By whose right? None. Yeah, yeah, I agree. But what does sex have to do with opening a trunk? It's frustration. Valerie feels deeply frustrated. And this provokes reactions which seem absurd to us. But they always have some explanation for it. Thanks for the Fernet. But what should a man do... if he wants to live with a woman. What's he to do then, huh? My friend, I have no answer to this question. Nice how she dresses, eh? Looks like a transvestite. - Goodbye, then. - Goodbye. Good luck. Look, I cut myself and it's all your fault. Your great idea of calling Michel. Now lick it. Go on! Lick it all up! Lick it...yeah... I'm warning you, this is the last time. It's too difficult for us to live together. Hi there. What are you doing here? I'm free today. I thought I'd pick up Pierrot so you two could have a break. Good idea. What are you making? A cannon. - For Pierrot? - Of course. Always war toys, hm? - You like it? - Yeah. Well, that's one person. The other one doesn't, she's got her own toys. Where's Valerie? In the other room with Pierrot. I'll go in and say hi. See you. Thanks for that. - Morning, Valerie. - Hi. I just bought some toys for him. They help develop co-ordination. They also stimulate creativity, sense of proportion, and imagination. Right? These ones are for next week. Here, have a look. They're from Russia. Not bad, those Russians. You know quite a bit. Now let's make a nice construction. Pierrot's really happy with you. Oh, look at the little doll. Look how nice. It's a little Pierrot. Aw, come here. Look, the puppet's crying. He's left alone. He doesn't have his baby anymore. He's all alone, crying. Why are you crying, Pierrot? Isn't your father being nice? Here, go play with your mother. Or mothers. Here, you take him. Do you know where I could find a cheap apartment? Move into an apartment? You can just come stay with me. That would be much better. Not easy living here? No, have you seen how possessive he is. Like with the baby. He doesn't want to share him with anyone. Pasta for lunch, what a big boy you're becoming. Something happened. Yesterday I called a friend to come and pick me up. Gerard wasn't happy about it. So I stayed. It's so embarrassing that I called him. I was depending on him. Forget it, you're young. The main thing is that you know what you do. Do you want some? He eats well with you. He's a fine boy, huh? Don't you want to finish? You like it, don't you? Let's take him with us. No, we couldn't do that. He's all that he's got. Now isn't this a great cannon? Come on, eat it. You like it. You say he's fat and then you give him pasta. Are you taking him away from me? We must ask ourselves why, in the last century.. there's only one man whose polygamy is accepted...the sailor. It's considered natural that the sailor have... But we can continue next time if you're interested. Yeah, fine. It's good, keep it up. I'm finished, Gerard. - You want the house done? - Yeah. - I'll see you next week then, okay? - Sure. Great. Long live Free Chile. I like you, Valerie. I'm happy to leave my son with you. See you, Gabrielle. How's the little sweater coming? You like it? Yeah, it's cute. - Let me try it on. - Wait, let me finish it. What's this? Character Development of Infants. Not bad. If you want to we could go out for a while later. Let's just stay home. Here, look. They're all coming from overseas, to here. The Modern World. To die? It's not that bad here. I'm going to watch the news. I'm not taking anything away from anyone. It's your system I'm criticising. Right now you're acting like a policeman. The problem is that people aren't conscious enough of what we're asking from them. That's not what counts. What counts is the couple. What does the couple mean? Look at this, Valerie. Feminists! My wife left everything... ...everything, even her son... to go with those crazies. Typical male. I envy them because they're brave enough to shout out what they feel. I can barely express myself. There are enough of you, but you still screw, screw, screw. The only thing you ever think about is you. Just hang around admiring yourself. Have a good look at your dick, because without it, you're nothing. Knock it off, what did this ever do to you? It did its job, didn't it? Why don't you tell me what you want, then? Come here, Pierrot. He gets no peace with all this damn racket. Did you hear what she said, Pierrot? Without this, we're nothing. It's just for show. That's what she said. That's what she thinks. We're nothing. When do you ever think about my needs? When do you hold me? Only when you feel like it. After you've come you're bored. You don't talk. Nothing. You'd rather be somewhere else. To the sea. A bar. Anywhere. Well, it's not like I can spend my whole life in bed with you. Not a bad idea though. I wouldn't mind that much. I can't get through to you at all. As soon as the need is gone, you're left alone. It's true. So, we're not fucking anymore. So, I'll want you all the time. So now I'll hold you, and care only about you. I love you, I caress you, I admire you, I hold you, I protect you. We'll lie next to each other without doing anything. I swear. I can't desire anything but you. So, I'm happy. I love you. I love you. I caress you. I respect you. I adore you, we're good together. I won't do anything. I won't hurt you. Won't force you. No, no, no. Nice game. Now we'll eat you. You're our bread. You feed us. Come here. The two of us will adore you all night. Everyone else is going to work now and I'm stuck on this forced vacation. What a stupid idea, not screwing her, I'm as hard as a rock. I can't get any sleep at all. - Do you want to go hunting? - Uh uh. Don't overdo it, okay? Happy hunting! - Who is it? - It's me. - Gerard? - Yeah, let me in. No, no, it's 6 a.m., you can't... Come on, Benoit. Open up. Open up. No, Gerard, this is impossible. I've got to be strong about this. You ignore me for days on end. But now I need you. You're only coming here to get what you want, you don't want me...please... You want to wake up your kid? - Is he up yet? - No. I dreamed about you all night. I want you so much. My dick wants you so much. Are you scared? Do you mean you love right now? - Yeah. - You're a liar. You can bring Pierrot over here when you need to, but it's over between us. But I need you. - Really? - Yes. Has she gone? Gone? She's up there asleep! But it's you I want. Did she kick you out of bed? Me? Kicked out of bed? Kicked out of bed?? Yes. No one kicks me out of bed. You can just forget it. Got it? I'm going. Where did your daddy go to, sneaking off like a thief, eh? You're up. I went out to stretch my legs. Slow down, that's not good for you. Whoops. Good, huh? There's none left. Come on, let's show daddy your news. Steady there, on your feet. Let's see you walk for daddy. Very good, Pierrot! You're walking! You're a man now. Even faster than me! He can walk! Why didn't you tell me? Come here to daddy. You stole his first steps from me, you kept it to yourself! He learned to walk, it's amazing. And you? I'm talking but you're not saying anything. And enough of this taking care of the baby, he has a father. You stand there like some virgin. You're afraid of letting go, well, this is the way that I am, what else can I do? This is the way I am, what else can I do? Yell, moan, shout, hit you? Don't worry, Pierrot, you have your father. I need attention too. Oh, Gerard. I don't want you to be alone. Gerard... Will you pick me up? Carry me in your arms. Are you cold? I'm not, I'm hot. Because I love you. When I want you, I think about being in a huge hotel. Somewhere near the sea, beside a pool. They'd be serving drinks and we'd be lying there naked. Yes, it's definitely warming up. I want you too, let's make love beside this beautiful sea, the two of us naked. No, no, no, I didn't tell you that because I wanted to fuck you. But I want to. No, not right now. If you want, we can get a room and do it right, maybe get a little champagne. Pretty weak of me, huh? After I swore I'd never touch you again. And we even got champagne. You're my baby. My big baby. Want a drink? Come here. Go on, have some. I didn't come. Who's this black girl? My first love. I was eleven. I jerked off over her so much. You can't imagine how much. You knew her here? I didn't know her at all, just had the photo. Only the photo... My father got it in Africa. Do you want something to eat? Here. Is this you? Yeah, that's me in the army. Come on, eat this, it's good for you. It was hard in the army. I spent half my time in jail. Did you have a girlfriend? I told you, I was stuck in jail. No girls in a jail cell. Is it true, that at two years old we're half the size we'd be as adults? My father used to measure me with a baguette. See how many marks? I'm not little any more. That's too bad. You were cute as a kid. This is a compass. It's an important tool in my job. My mother gave it to me when I was seven. It was important to her. And so, that's how, without planning to... I ended up being an engineer. And breaking my father's balls. Ow, what the hell?? Drawing circles on my skin? You're crazy. Go on, lick it up. Lick it. Lick it...yeah... Lick it. "Engineer". A compass! Brings back memories. Look. Oh, it's torn. What is it? Are you kidding? Don't you know anything about sex? You really don't know what this is? It was a sign of virility when I was young... to keep one in your wallet. Now it's a flower. See? It's a flower. It's the bloom of the Indies. Open your mouth. Wider. Take it. Suck it. Bite down on it. What about you, don't you have memories? Let's check your trunk. There's nothing in there. Let's see. A turtle and a comb. A comb in a turtle! Aha, written memories. And these are pictures of you? Good morning, miss. Ah, and this one is your mother. And this must be your father. Good morning, sir, good morning. There's your father again... you...you...first communion Nothing. Nothing else? No photos of anyone else? Not even your first love? This is sweet. Not little anymore. Too bad, you were cute when you were a kid. Nothing. I can't believe it. You don't have any memories. Nothing, nothing, no imagination. This trunk is empty. What's this? Your dowry? Bestiality, eh? I like cats. You like cats, huh? Come here. Yours, mine, our memories - they're a bunch of shit. All shit. We'll make some new memories. I'm young. I don't want memories. Come on. Something's missing... Let's have a look. Yes, that's perfect. Since we love each other we should get married. We'll make it official. Look there and smile. We'll build ourselves a whole life. You always decide everything. I'm not sure I like this. This scares me more than spending my life alone. Can't you broaden your thinking? You know what you are? You're a patriarch. But the family you want is over. A man and a woman is one thing, a family is another. I didn't decide all this! What have you got against the family? Go to sleep. What do you suggest instead? Come on then, you decide. Leave the ball alone! Can't you see that I'm trying? Those shitty photos. I did that for you. Can't we come up with something new? Oh, man... You're mad. Are you? Are you mad? Crazy bitch. Spineless bitch! What can I do? Women have destinies. It's true. But a man has a destiny too. What's missing is freedom. The freedom to be a man who is different from the ideal. All that ideal shit. We're patriarchs. Patriarchs of familes that don't exist anymore. We had rights. Nice rights. The right to fuck. It was so easy. Natural. Just screw. No problems. But now it's not true. My head's too small to figure out what she wants. She's wearing me down, I don't know why. Not so fast, Pierrot, slowly. You're a glutton, don't pretend you don't understand. I said slowly. Are you my friend? Will you stay with me and be my friend? You have to be my friend, I'm alone, right? What else is left? There, my little Pierrot. Is that what's left? The right to have a dick. Yes, the ideal needs to be changed. No, no more. You only think about eating. Why did you wake him? Because I'm alone. And I'm not? Come on, dear. That's right, walk. That's very good, darling. Subbed by Badge
