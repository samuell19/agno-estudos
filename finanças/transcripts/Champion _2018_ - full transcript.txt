You think I don't know about it? I thought you'll finally come and confront me But you went to the police and turned... Don't get upset, Dhana. He's got a valid point True! The tower deal is Rs.30,000/month. I pay him only Rs.10,000. I'm not denying it But every month, for past 7 years, I've been depositing that 20,000 in my wife's account For his sake! Why deposit in your wife's account? Sir, he is a prodigal; very bad with saving money Had I paid the full 30,000 every month, he'll wipe it off all and become a pauper With such a face! Why didn't you say a word to me regarding your outlet business plan? Any idea how much I've saved for you, in her account? Tell him! Rs. 23,40,000! Throw his money on his face. Take it and leave! - Ask him to leave! - Boss! Boss! He lied to your father that he had saved up the money in his wife's account He gained you father's trust back Look, I know you for the past 16 years You made a hasty decision by involving the police I considered you as my very own, younger brother There's a lot I had planned for you Do you think I need your money to run my family? - Didn't it cross your mind? - Forgive me, boss My bad Fine, I don't have any grudge.

If something had happened to that guy yesterday... you'd be in prison and your mother would've passed away No way, coach If Shabir hadn't played spoilsport, Dhana would've been dead by now I would've finished him off secretly, exactly the way he murdered my dad No one would've found out that I did it But you'd know right? Won't the guilt trouble you after finishing him off? Then can you ever play like before? I have been awestruck by many players while watching them on TV But in person... only a few have impressed me And in your age group, only you! You are something special by nature I'm unable to deal with it, coach I'm unable to control the rage in me to kill him! Your mom fell at that girl's father feet and pleaded to him She has got you a second chance in life A woman, struggling all by herself... and to raise a son like you, do you've any idea how difficult it is? Fortunately... Dhanasekar is unaware of all this. Good for you Fine... I'm asking you for the final time Are you going to fulfill your father's dream? Or are you going to kill him and punish your innocent mother by ruining your life? Just...get lost! How's Shabir now? We brought him back to home The doctor has advised him 15 days rest Shall I come to your home and pay him a visit? No! No need! My family has doubts about us What doubts? They doubt if we both are in love Tell Shabir that there is nothing between us Goal! Yay! Jones! Coach? Yes, coach? Here, talk Who's on the call, coach?

Dude! - How did you get her number? Pavithra has been in touch with me. She inquires about you every day She said she'll stop calling me if you find out. That's why I had to keep is a secret Sorry dude - Take your hands off. I won't hit you - Buddy... Buddy, please... Buddy! Dhamu! Why did Jones come to the market other day? I don't know! - Drown him! Like that! - Speak up! - Speak up or else... - That's all I know I'll drown you here - He's just repeating the same - Drown him! - David! - Coming, boss Don't stop. Continue. I'll be back What is he saying? Boss, Jones had been to Perambur ground in his bike He got a call and so midway he changed direction and came to the market But this boy has no idea about who called him and for what Boss, I saw him ten days ago near the liquor shop He was messing with that man, Rajiv Gandhi What's up, Gandhi? Looks like you're done Come on, friend. Let's begin again Listen! Gandhi! - Tell me - Don't turn your head at once I'm here to spy on you Dhana sent me Our boys will come now They'll try to bait you and pull out the truth. Don't you fall for it Didn't you tell Jones, the truth about his dad's death? Boss has a small doubt on you Quiet. It's my boss Yes boss Reached? - Yes, I did - Put the phone in speaker mode Ok, boss. Stay on the line What's up, Gandhi? Are you done for the night? How about one more large? - Pour me also a drink - How are you, Gandhi? Of late you're not to be seen around, Gandhi? David, first pour for him You! Order some side dish Gandhi... Goldstar Gopi's son... came to our boss asking for a job Is he old enough to go for a job? Haven't you met him? - I did, back when he was a kid - Now he is a grown up I'd have known if I had married and had a family Time just flies Poor Gandhi, he is innocent Gandhi, enough. Go home Don't get wasted. See you Gandhi, go home safe - See you, Gandhi - See you! Don't point at him. You must have seen someone else - Naveen... - Yes Gandhi? - Hope they didn't get any doubt on me - No. Not at all By the way... how did Dhana come to know that I told everything to Jones? Gandhi! You just said it - Time's up! All of you leave - Leave, all of you! You all heard us! Leave! Sit down I said, sit down So, this is your brand? The same brand for the past 20 years. Never changed it! This brand is what suits us, Gandhi. It doesn't give us a hangover Brother Rajiv Gandhi's death smells fishy to me I don't think he would've accidentally fell off into the sewage, coach Then? Rajiv Gandhi told me the truth about my dad's death I doubt if Dhana found out that In that case, Dhana would've finished you off first. Don't confuse yourself - Hello - Hello, Jones... Have your started back to home? Yes, I'm on my way, mom - I'll be at home in half an hour - Ok I'm preparing mutton dish. Bring coach, Shantha along Ok, mom I'll bring him along Do you want me to buy something from Sundari's shop? - Dude! - What happened? Hello, Jones? What happened?

Now, switch on the fan Stop wondering and make tea for my men No, thanks. Please serve our men waiting outside Jaya... Looks like Jones isn't take usual 'Water tank' route to the ground Looks like he takes the market road. My boys told me Ask him to stay safe. After all, that issue involves a girl They might seem to be quiet but will have heart full of vengeance They'll finish him of silently Look what happened to our friend, Rajiv Gandhi Don't know why, someone finished him off What's the use lamenting after dying? Anything can happen in a fraction of a second Now... There is Gopi's photo Step forward, Jaya Now, next to Gopi's photo we'll have Jones'... Doofus! Why are you looking like you've seen a ghost? I meant frame and hang Jones' certificate It's a big deal to make to the 2nd division in football Oh God!

He wants to buy our old house - And? - I said I'm ready to sell it to him Why would you let him buy our house? Any idea, what he did? I know he's the one who murdered your father I knew it already Even though I knew it... I moved away from there and came here just for your sake I didn't want you to fall in his eyesight Now, you tired attacking him and that's what made him come to our home, so far If you again think of finishing him off... then it'll be over my dead body Mom, make it fast - Come - Coming Collect the documents Wait, face towards the east side Good Hand it over to my mother, Jaya Keep it near the God's idol and pray Ok, dear I'm very happy, Jaya Brother... My husband died on the ground I very well know why and how he died The reason I left this locality right after his death was just because... I wanted my son to lead a happy and successful life Even now... the reason behind I'm letting you buy my house, which is dear to me... is because I still want my son to have a happy and successful life Please, nothing bad should happen to him Boss... I thought she'll refuse to sell the house and lose her son She is smart. She sold the house and saved her son I know... that you'll finish me off Go ahead But one thing...

Like me, every youth from North Madras will always have valor and be daring! But we can't afford to buy a football or a jersey or soccer boots This poverty is our first problem Second, we don't get good nutritious food after becoming exhausted from playing Third, the stamp of 'violence' on our back! Every North Madras youth, like me, who crosses... these 3 problems and steps in the ground... is a CHAMPION!
