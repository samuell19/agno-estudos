- Hi mom! - Why haven't you gone yet? We do not know. - Where is Dad? - He's in there. Why didn't you go? They have called from Stockholm. Police. They want me to come up. Why? I do not know. - I'm coming with. - No, stay with the girls. It's not necessary. It is best if only I go. Rebecca is coming too. - Should I drive you to the airport? - I ordered a taxi. - Do you call when you arrive? - Yes. QUEEN OF HEARTS Mother. There is someone in the bathroom. It's one I help at work. Have you found your shoes? - No. - Then you can bring others. I thought we had a deal. No, we had a discussion in which we did not agree. I don't have my patients visiting here at home. Because they suffer of all possible infectious diseases. This is not possible. It's our home and we should not have people running. There are people who need help. Now we do not discuss if they need help. - We are discussing whether they should be here. - I can't handle this. It will not work when Gustav moves here. Can't have a place where the girls are free from your job? A single place where the girls allowed to have their mother for themselves? They do not take damage to be visited by reality. What? Why can't you just say: "Okay, Peter"? Why should everything need discussed into the infinite? It's my home too. I am right to say what I think and think. Okay, Peter. - I see, Peter. You are right. - No no no... I'm so lucky. You know that, huh? Yes I know that. Did you drink alcohol that night? - Yes. - How much had you been drinking? Two to three glasses. - Two or three? - Three. How many men have you been? on a date with the past year? - Under ten? Over ten? - Under ten. And how many of them have you had sex with? Thus, you must be prepared for that the defender is going really hard for you. They would like to paint a picture by a woman who wanted to. Okay? So how many? - Seven, I think. - Do you think? No, I... Seven. Good. You will to do well in court. Do you think there are many? You have nothing to be ashamed of. At all. "The first bit was the rabbit hole like a tunnel." "Then it swung so suddenly that Alice couldn't think" - - "on stopping and she fell and fell into a well." "Either it was very deep or Alice fell very slowly" - - "'cause she could look around and think about what would happen." Mother? Why don't I get it stay up to when Gustav comes? Well, they come late. I promise not to say anything to Frida. - He's here tomorrow when you wake up. - Are we his family now? We have been there all along. - Why hasn't he lived with us? - You know he lived with Rebecca. - Why? - Because she's his mother. He couldn't live in two countries simultaneously. - So dad would rather be with us? - It's not that simple, old man. Now you should think no more. Now you go to sleep. - Good night. - Good night. Hello. Hi. Are you here already? - Welcome, Gustav. - Thanks. It's fun to see you. - Have you had a good trip? - Yes. The keychain is for your new key. - I did the drawings. Fine, huh? - Thanks. I made that wooden heart of wood. We have a workshop at the school. - With a machine-like, a machine... - Go and sit down now. Come on. - What will you have? - Dad, can you pick us up today? No, today my mom fetches you. I have to make some arrangements with Gustav. - Can I come with? - No, it's just him and me. - It is unfair. - Yes. It is. The world is evil. Peace, sit down in your own place. - I want to sit with my dad. - You're a big girl. Come on now. I thought we would go and Buy some things for your room today. Yes. If you want that. I thought it could be nice to make it a little more your own. Yes of course. - Can you take that? - Yes. I did not think you had contact with him. He has been kicked out of school again. Rebecca wanted to put him on board. school, but he leaves school here. - He starts after the summer holidays. - Can he speak Danish? That's the smallest problem, after all. He is totally against the whole project. I understand that. He's going away from their friends and everything. It's not forever. I expect him to move again. Yet...! - What does Peter say about that? - He is happy, I think. He's obviously a little too... you know. I think it will be good. - So they can get closer to each other. - Yes it's true. How's Mom? She has just been hospitalized again. Pneumonia. I think she would be happy for a visit. Yes. It is totally unacceptable that you pull it out like this. Yes. I think you see it yourself if you take off the system hat. Yes Yes. Good. You just call. Yes. Thousand thanks. Hi. Hi. Sorry. I didn't think you were home. I was just going down with some of your stuff. And so... Is it good? What is it about? - A man. - Okay? - Just a man? - Yes. Oh okay. - Sorry, I know it's late. - Has something happened? - I just don't think it's going anyway. - I know it's hard. - But I'm sitting right next to you. - I can not. So, I can't. I understand you most of all just want to escape right now. But you can try to think of you not just do it for your own sake? That you do it for all girls who goes around out there? I just wish I hadn't started all this. - What are you afraid of? - That they don't believe me. Yes, I understand that too. It is possible that he is free. But if you don't testify, it's you which lets him escape. And I think so that you will regret it. Shouldn't I take that one? - Who should shower first? - You did it last. Because the horse threw me off. - Come on. Can I get your helmet? - That's not a good reason. - I was totally sick of shit. - Yes, but I smell the most. You both smell the two very sweet. Okay. Then we have to turn it around. What should I do? I can't be in Sweden and I can't be here. You're not old enough. When you are you get to do exactly what you want. You are not of age. Now Mom decides and I what is best for you. You don't hear. Listen to me. You are not allowed to move from home. Because you are so damn good to communicate? - Where are you going? - I'm going out! God damnit! It is as if we are not at all know each other. This is your first time living together. It takes time to find each other. - I have no idea who he is. - No, but it's coming. I do not know. Maybe it was wrong decision to take him here. It might be better for him at boarding school. - You know it's wrong. - He doesn't want to be here. - I know. He hates me. - Of course. You're his dad. You just have to find that out. You're the adult. Rebecca has given him free reins far too long. What? Because she is so damn self-absorbed and then she gives up - - and then it tracks out and then I can stand here with the shit. That is not nice. Who stood with the shit when you stabbed? - When the hell did you become Rebecca's ally? - She's been alone with everything. - I haven't been able to help. - You get it now. Yes Yes. But it may be too late. Maybe we should too expect more from him. Right now he lives here as if he lives in a hotel. I don't think that's very healthy. He needs to get involved a little. Hello? Yes Yes. No no no. No, I'm coming in. Absolutely. Hi. - Good night. - Good night. Wait! Wait! You did really well. - I feel so stupid. - Yes, but that's not your fault. They didn't believe me. And that's what I said. What? Are you having fun? I'll call you later. Yes. Okay, hey. Does it feel good? An iPad, my bag, your watches, jewelry. I have no full overview over what's missing. I called the police. They are on their way here. Just wait a moment. Gustav, check your room if you missing something. We have had burglary. Okay. Yes. No. No, luckily. They are riding. Okay. Yes. Yeah see you. Hi. - I didn't charge, I implied. - You sought out the accused in the parking garage. My client was dragged around the manege and the defendant amused himself. Gives the law firm him the right then it can be fine and a warning. - I will pay. - It's not the money. It's upsetting. Don't you understand? Why are you so busy of what people think? - So is my company. - Yes, I know that. But you knew what you were getting into. You know me. You know how I am. When did you become such a coward, huh? Can't you just for once Admit that you made a mistake? - Stop now. - You have to learn to master yourself. - Yes. - Yes. I found this one. Isn't it yours? Yes please. I found it out on the driveway some time ago. And put it in my bag. But then I forgot to give it to you... And then my bag was stolen because we had a break-in. So I found it today in your pants when I would wash your clothes. Have you rotated among my stuff? It is quite advanced to do burglary in his own home, Gustav. - What are you talking about now? - Where did you do everything you stole? Do you work with me now or? You have to tell Peter. And then we have to go to the police and then explain it to them. I can tell him, if it is better. Do whatever the hell you want. I'm sorry in which. You do not know me. I know the system. It is difficult to get out if you go well. Especially for someone like you that they have already got hold of. But there is another possibility. That we don't say that to anyone. But it requires you to become a part of the family and sharpen you. But I don't know if you can. You have to decide that. What is your pet food? - Can you just pick one thing? - Yes of course. Then I say curry meatballs. Pets? I have a rabbit and a dog and a horse, but I can only choose one thing. - Then I say dog. - Fine. What's the matter with the tape recorder? It's my old one actually. He found it down in the basement. I don't know what it is about. - Now Lucas also wants a brother. - Then you get some more, Lina. You can hook me up with a delicious young doctor at the hospital, Peter. They are probably over, but I certainly can find some old doctor. Is it more your style? A lot of hair in the ears. What would you bring? Okay, in that case my quilt. Hi. Hi. Sorry, we... This is Amanda. Hi. It's my stepmother. - Hello. - Hello. - Amanda. Hi. - Anne. Hi. - Welcome. - Thanks. - Have you been out? - Yes you could say that. Or we've just been around a bit and enjoyed it a little. - I didn't know you were up. - I just sit and work. But... hey, hey. We should not interfere, so... - And what do you do then? - I throw the chair against the window. - Why? - I want to go out. - Why don't you just open the window? - It's screwed. - Why don't you use the door then? - It's locked. The window is screwed and the door locked by your foster parents from outside. - Is it correct? - Yes. What do you do when your foster father finally opens the door? Then I push him. Why do you do it? I just want to get away from it. Thanks. It was getting late. I had something I had to to watch until tomorrow. - I'm not quite done here yet. - Are you sure? I have started the article which I promised to write. - You can write it this weekend. - No, because then I'm at a conference. - Are you? - It says in the calendar. I hadn't seen that. Look at this shell. I rinse it a bit. I found one! A seashell! - No, it was just a stick. - There! - There, there, there, there! - What did you find? Don't you go swimming? No, I have something I need to fix. Boring! Lets see if I find anything. - We will look for white shells. - And mussels. - Are you going to swim? - Yes, I thought so. You never want to bathe. - I've found something! - What did you find? - There! Isn't it nice? - Yes. Is she completely gone? Do you miss Stockholm? Yes. And no. You are welcome to invite people here that you want to meet. I haven't really so many friends. No. Neither have I. - Where did you get those? - These? It's a bit here and there. I know someone who knows someone and... I've done these myself. I did not believe that you did more, stuff like that. Yes. It's crap. - I can do one on you. - No. I shouldn't have any. - Why not? - Because I just shouldn't. It's just skin. If I wanted a tattoo I had got one. I've had many chances. No. May I check your arm? May I look at your arm? - Yes, perfect. Here. A tiny one. - No. Not there. What? - Where? - Well, nowhere! A little higher up. Wait. I'll check it out. Here. The world's smallest tattoo. Forget it. Where, you say? Do you like it? Yes... - That's it. - That's it. And this ... Satan... We're talking thousands of dead toads which is around this pond. - And everyone has exploded. - Was it an explosion in the pond? You first suspect it was a virus the toads had received. A virus from South American horses which was nearby at a riding school. Then a biologist takes a closer look at it and then you discover - - to the back of all toads then there is a small, small hole. And all toads lack their liver. - So it was a toad massacre? - Did the liver burst out of the body? No, it didn't explode, but removed. - By who? - Is it a delicacy? - Who wants to eat it? - Birds, maybe? - Exactly. A bird. - Is it true? And what bird? Not any bird. - A crow! - A crow. - It's the ones with the jewelry, huh? - No, it's raven. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you okay? - Yes Yes. - Aren't you supposed to go up and get health? - Rather not. I understand that. Where are you going? If asked. I'll just go and buy cigarettes. Do you want to join? If asked. It'll be fucking cool. Yes. Are you kidding? You have guests. Yes. What about Amanda? What? It may not be what she is called. - Anita? Amalie? Anton? - No, her name is Amanda. Her name is Amanda. It was just the way you say it. Is she cute? She is cute. - She is cute. - Are you together or what? What then, or what? She might not be one that you get along with? But what? What kind of thing that you don't get along with? - I think you know. - You think so? - And you? - Me and Peter? It is good. I don't expect that that you want to hear something about. I didn't want to hear anyway about mom and her... - Did she have many? - Yes. - And you? - Me? It's hard to answer. I probably wasn't quite as active who you are, I think. I gotta go. Amanda. Anton. But thank you very much for the beer and everything. See you at home. - Where have you been anywhere? - Have they already gone? I've been trying to get hold of you, though the cellphone was here. Where have you been? - I was just walking around. - A turn? We had guests. Are you aware of how disrespectful it's against me and against them? I was worried. At least take with the mobile so I can get hold of you. Get it together! Here you are. The rest is yours. Five, six, seven, eight - - nine, ten, eleven, twelve - - thirteen, fourteen... Running! Frida is taken! Come on, Gustav! Hurry up! Okay. One, two three - - four, five, six, seven, eight... - Hello. Need help? - Yes, I want to look at a computer. - Something special? - No, it should know a little bit of each. - Some heavy work or...? - No, it should just be good. For school assignments and stuff. What does this cost? By the way, I have bought a new computer for Gustav. Why? He needed decent stuff. Is it a problem or what? No. Then there is no excuse for not doing homework. - When he starts school. - We might have talked about it. How can that be a problem that I buy a computer for your son? Because he is my son. I might have wanted to be there. Should I ask for praise when I cook to him or wash his clothes? Or is it just when something is fun? No no. That was nice of you. Well, I mean it. The... That was nice of you. Sorry. Can I try? - Come here. - Huh? No no no. - Not here. - Why not? - Because we wake them up. - And what then? What? Not here, I said. Because we raise the kids. We go up instead, we go up in bed. Come, come, come. So came. What the hell?! He said I had gossiped for the municipality. Otherwise, they would not have started to keep track of us again. Then I said I hadn't said anything, but he didn't believe me. And then he grabbed me and then I just ran. Is that something he does often? Hit you? - He is unpleasant when he drinks. - Does he drink a lot? Every day? I have to report this. You know that, huh? He didn't do it on purpose. No, I know. But I have to report it. - He didn't do it on purpose. - No. But I have to inform the authorities. I want to go home now. - I can't let you go home. - I want to go home now! - Yes, I understand, Sara. - Let me get out then! - Sara, it's for your own sake. - You are not the boss of me! - I know, but I'm guilty... - I want to go home! - We're going now. - Yes. - It was good that you called. - Have a good time, Sara. - Hello. - Hello. "Let's all move a place." In the same sentence he jumped on. And Alice was the only one which got worse than before - - because the Easter Bunny had rolled out the whole milk jug over his plate. Alice did not want to offend the Seafarer and asked very carefully... Good. See ya. Hello? Oh no... No, no, no. Are you sitting here in the nice weather? Where is Mom? - Hello! Where is Mom? - We don't know. It was early. I couldn't concentrate. So I took time off. So, girls. Now we go out. The sun shines. Air, air. Come here. - Who are you? - You know that. What is the best you have experienced in your life? Getting the girls. - And the worst? - Losing my dad. - And how old were you when he died? - Elva. He had a bad heart. Who is your best friend? It's Lina, my sister. What are you most afraid of? That everything should disappear. Which is your favorite dish? - Cheese. - Cheese is not a dish. It depends on how much you eat. If only you could bring it a single thing to a desert island - - what would that be? One? Matches. Clever. Who was the first person you had sex with? - Are you all asking for it? - You have to answer all the questions. It was one it would not have been. Who? I do not want to talk about it. Why? Yes, to... Sometimes it happens and that, that may not happen the same. A little like the two of us? It was fun. I'll get the girls. - What are you going to open now? - We'll take these. Yes, it's exciting. These are not soft gifts. - How cool! - Mighty! - They shoot water! - It's a water cannon. - What delicious! - They are so nice! - Mom, can we try them? - Shouldn't you open all the packages? - We'll do that later. - Please, Mom! - Okay. I fetch water. - Did you say thank you? - Happy birthday. - Thank you, Lucas. Hi. Hi. Not now. Not here. - What then? What is it? - Not here, I said! - Are you okay? - Yes. - Why? - Why do you think? - Stop now. - What the hell are you doing? - What are you doing? What? - It's nothing. - Can not you stay? - He's a kid! - Lucas! And then we clearly sing it English version too, right? Let's start with Fanny. A quadruple living for Fanny! She live, hip, hip! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! And so for Frida! Just leave it at that. I will take it. - What is it? - We won't talk now. - What is happening? - You should leave me alone! - Huh? - You should leave me alone! - What? - Can you stop that? Can you stop throwing them there? Shut up. Then I throw on your friends instead. Gustav, can you come down from there? You destroy the whole birthday party. - Can you come down from there? - What is it? Can you stop throwing? Can you stop throwing and come down? So we can continue! - What are you afraid of? - You're destroying! - Are you afraid I'll fall down? - Please. Can you just come down? - What is he throwing? - Beware! Stop now. - What did you say? - You can meet someone. It hurts. Gustav? Can you hear me? Lie still, don't move. Call an ambulance. - Don't move, lie completely still. - I can't feel my legs. - Lie still. - Call an ambulance! - Don't have a cellphone? - Lie still. - Do you call? - I can't feel my legs. It'll be fine, Gustav. Just lie completely still. No, but wait, wait. Sorry, I was just kidding. - It was just a joke. - It's enough now. - Dad, sorry. Sorry. - Let me go. Let me go, I say! It was just... What the hell is wrong with him? I think we do everything we can, but it just doesn't work. We might still watch on other possibilities. What then? Do you want me to send him away? - That's not what I said. - What are you saying then? I do not know. - You have to mean something. - You said it yourself. But I just can't give up on my own child? - No. - You don't do that? No. I'm just trying to help, okay? We have always known that it would end sometime. And that time is now. - Gustav. Do you understand? - I said that. It is quiet. I hope not that it needs to destroy something. What then, what do you mean? We are happy too to have you living here. You mean a lot to the girls. Yes of course. - Peter, then? - What then? - You don't tell him anything, do you? - No, of course I don't. No, good, good, good. None of us should say something to Peter. Or to someone else. - I hope we agree. - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Get some time together. You may want to think about it. - Yes Yes. - Please, try. - Hello. - Yes, I'll think about it. Hi. I'm thinking of going up to the cottage a couple of days with Gustav. It would be good for us to be together, just he and I. - I think we will go tonight. - Okay. - Isn't that good? - Yes... You think that's a bad suggestion? No. I'm just trying understand your priorities. How, then, priorities? You worked almost all the girls' praise and can now be free with Gustav? - Did you want to come along? - No, we're not going. Lina has called. - To you? - Yes. What did she want? She left no message. She wanted to get hold of you. "Take off your hat," the king said Hatter. "It's not mine." "Theft," the King exclaimed and turned to the jury - - who took it into account. "I have it to sell it." - "I don't own a hat myself"... - Mom? It's because... Why didn't we get it? follow up with Sweden? Dad and Gustav needed go there yourself, Just the two. What do you think they're doing up there? They do what we usually do when we're up in the cabin. Fish and... and chop wood - - and baths and light a fire in the garden. Talking. Are you coming? If we are to succeed, we must go now. - Hello. - Hello. - They should ride, so we looked in. - We have strawberry pie with us. I tried to call, but now we took the chance. - The girls were missing Lucas. - We have already agreed something today. - Okay. - But wedge in and say hello to him. - I've called many times. - Yes, I know that. - Can't we talk a little? - No, I really don't want to. You called Peter. You have not supposed to say something to him, huh? Line. Should you start crying now? It's not you it's a pity. - It is over. And it just happened. - I don't want to hear and you should go. - Can't we talk? What? - I want you to go. Girls? Come on. - Come on, old man. - Can't we stay a little longer? It doesn't fit very well today. What? No, another day. - See you. - See you, Lucas! - Bye. - Hello! Hello Darling. That's me. I just wanted to hear if everything is okay. I just needed to hear your voice. Can't you call? - Are Dad and Gustav already at home? - Yes apparently. - Yes! - Take off your riding clothes! Gustav! Hi. - Dad! - Hello. Oh, you two... - Wouldn't you stay for a week? - Yes, but I missed you so. - Where's Gustav? - He would just leave for a little while. - We went home taxi. - Yeah? Why? Because the mother's car has broken. Broken? It stopped. It's done again in a few days. We were the very, very last which was downloaded. I was going to go into the office and get some paper. You should not go anywhere. Sit down. I've talked to Gustav. He told me he had... He has decided that he wants to start a boarding school. Yes? Yes, but it might be great. Do you think? Yes, if that's what he wants. Yes... I told him that I - - got really happy because I finally did got the chance to stay with him again. How much I had been missing with him ever since he was little. Then he suddenly collapsed. And then he told me... That you two... That you have had a relationship with my son. Yes. But that's crazy. You don't believe that? Right now, I actually don't know what to believe. Why would he tell you if it wasn't true? Don't you think it's obvious? Attention. Because. Why would I want to a relationship with your son? This is an absolutely absurd accusation. He told details about you two, things he can't possibly think of. We're not done here. I have endured so much from him. I've treated him so well I could and will just get shit back! Hey! But this is the limit what I find myself in. - What are you doing? - Packs. I know he's had a hard time. He has learned to hate me since he did was small because I stole his father. Can you stop that? I also understand that he wants to punish me for what has happened. But this... it's totally sick. Can you stop this? Can't you calm down a little? If you just calm down a little, so we can talk about this. Anne... If you believe it, you are not the one I thought you were. What the hell are you imagining ?! I will never forgive you for this. I'm just telling you what Gustav have told me. I beg you. And you believe more in a boy you don't than do she know who gave birth to your children? I don't know what to believe! What should I believe ?! - Anne, for hell. - Stop it! Anne? Ask your son who broke in in our house and stole our stuff. - Huh? - Yes. - Gustav? - Yes. But I spared you, because I wanted to give give him another chance. For your sake. You have no idea how people work. You don't see a single shit. You don't see the game he's playing, do you? He wants you to choose me so he can get you to himself. Think you're so easy to manipulate. - If you just explain to me how... - Explains what? I can't convince you that it has not happened. You have decided. I'm going away a few days. And when I'm back... - you should have found another home and Gustav should be gone. Please. Can't we just take it a little calm and talk about it? Well, there is no reason to be so dramatic... You think I'm a monster. - What is your favorite season? - Spring. So, it's hot ... - Who are you? - You know that. What is the best you have experienced in your life? We need to talk about what you told us for me upstairs in the cabin. And I know I haven't existed for you when you were little- - and I'm terribly sorry for that and I understand you're angry, but... It's not Anne's fault that Rebecca and I separated. We had been bad for a long time. We weren't good for each other. We understand that it was difficult for you to come down here and give up everything. We may not have been good enough at to make you feel at home here. We may not have been good enough at to listen to you and your needs. You only need to know one thing and it is that we want to get better at it. And we are here for you. What's this? What you accuse Anne of is very, very serious. No matter how angry you are, you can't just think of something like that. It's not possible. You can't lie about that. But, so... Dad, I haven't lied. Aren't you going to say something? What? - Huh ?! - Gustav. Please. It is okay. I understand if you are sorry. And I understand too that you think everything is difficult. But this ... - Why do you do it? - You know exactly why I'm doing it. No, I don't really know. Thus... - Are you completely ill in your head? - You lied to us. You stole from us. But now it is a stop, now it is enough. We are a family, Gustav. In a family you have to be able to trust each other. If we can't, we can't have you accommodation here. As simple as that. So how do you want to do? How do you feel that we should move on from here? What do you need? Talk to me. Say something! Gustav ... He can't live here anymore. - Now we have to go, Fanny. - No. - You can greet Gustav at school. - No! Yes. So ... So, come on. - Fanny. - Go to Mom. Is that something you're craving for? What? I was just asking if you needed anything. No. - Hello Sara. - Hello. I was allowed to quickly get by with these. Why should I have flowers? I just want to say thank you because you helped me. Of course. How's your dad? I have had a foster family until he feels better. - They seem pretty nice. - It sounds really good. I might call one day and tells you how. I would be very happy for that. - Yeah see you. - We'll do that. - Hello. And Merry Christmas. - Thanks. Good morning. It can feel difficult while it's going on, with this discipline. - But I'm pretty sure you... - Hello. Good morning. Should we...? Do you want to? Yes... Have a good time. What are you doing here? - You have to tell everything to Peter. - It's not going to happen. He must know that I'm not lying. Otherwise I will notify you. Yes? What do you want to get out of it? Redress. Okay. What exactly is it that you mean that I have done to you? You're an adult. And what are you? A child? Have I wronged you? I do not know. You're the expert on this, so you tell me. Is that something I've misunderstood? Didn't you have fun at all? This is not the case whether I wanted to or not. It's about what happened is illegal and you know it too! You if anybody should know! What? Why do you think someone is coming? to believe in your story? Because it is true. You have no evidence, Gustav. What? No one will listen to someone like you. You're not credible. I think you should come out on the other side of this. Tell your dad that you found and we can all move on. And if you can't, then you must stay away. Four, three, two, one. Now you have to look. A dog! Open. Good. Open the door. Open the door! - I want to talk to Peter. - Dad! - You wake the girls. Shut up! I shit in it! Beware, I want in! - No no no. Come on. Nice and easy. - Let go. Release. Let go! Let me go! Let go! Let go! - I want to talk to my dad. Not with you. - Dad! Dad! You should not come and wake up the whole house. And then listen! Your dad can't do it anymore. Do you understand? What? Dad! Your dad can't stand anymore. Do you understand? What? You take up too much space. You don't live here anymore. What? You should go now. Go with you. Dear Anne, dear birthday children. An old saying goes like this: "After a collector there will be a spreader." It is a very accurate description by Annes and my collaboration. Yes, I think you already have figured out how the role distribution is. Unlike us others, you have received nothing to be donated in life. You have fought hard to create a better upbringing for your girls - - than you have had yourself. The journey you have made has given you an insight, a resilience - that you use every day in your work - - and that comes all those people that you meet on your way to good. Thanks. Are you nice? It's really nice. I'm really glad you came anyway. That means a lot to me. Thanks. I work well when I listen on jazz. I can actually read. You probably work well too if you listen to something else. No. It can be very easy be noisy to me. Was it Rebecca? What did she say? - She doesn't know where Gustav is anywhere. - What do you mean? He hasn't been to school then before the Christmas holidays. And there is none who has seen him? No. Has she reported missing him? No not yet. - Should we send people home? - No! Obviously not. - Are you sure? - Yes Yes. It's your party. Hi mom! - Why haven't you gone yet? - We don't know. Why didn't you go? They have called from Stockholm. Police. They want me to get up there. Why? I do not know. - I'm coming with. - No, stay with the girls. It's not necessary. It is best if only I go. Rebecca is coming too. - Should I drive you to the airport? - I ordered a taxi. - Do you call when you arrive? - Yes. It was a hunter who found him. Far in the woods. Almost up at the cabin actually. They think he was lying there for a few months, then the snow fell. Now that it started to thaw, so... Probably he has frozen to death. Maybe he got tired and maybe just wanted to rest. I do not know. I really do not know. Drugs and alcohol may have contributed, but we know that after the autopsy. They even believed that he might, that he... That he had... That he had simply given up and just sat down. When he lived with us... Gustav... Nothing was your fault. It wasn't your fault. I knew not what I would do ... Stop!
