At the end of Cromwell's time, in and around the year of our Lord, 1660... two things miraculous came about which, as l shall relate... gave us great hope for the future ofthis island, this England The first, the Restoration of Charles Stuart to his throne of England... after many long years of exile in Holland - miraculous for his father, King Charles, was executed by Cromwell... only 11 years earlier And the second, the birth of Henry Purcell, organist, composer... his father and his uncle both ofthe Chapel Royal in the great Abbey at Westminster From heaven he came Their lives were drawn together as if by divine hand And together they changed our history for ever Kind Heaven, make us Englishman again Any who may show good reason... why Charles Stuart shall not be King of England... let him come forth and speak Dread Sovereign, I offer no flattering titles, but speak words of truth You are the desire ofthree kingdoms... the strength and stay of the tribes of the people Really? Why then did it take you so long to ask me back'? Oddsfish, Mr Newton, what's this'? A wrestling match'? Mr Newton, why are you upon the floor'? Well, we're sure never to see his like again... in this world 'Tis said, we have a pretty, witty King, whose word no man relies on He never says a foolish thing, and never does a wise one To which His Majesty replied: "That is very true, for my words are my own... my actions are those of my Ministers" illllfl HIIIIiQDQIIfiI Dire Well, it's a creaky old play I rather liked it. Howwould you know? You've never seen it No, but I've heard it, forweeks I'm never dry there! Oh, don't look so sad, sweetheart.

Sorry Don't apologise to me Nelly Gwyn, apologise to Charles Ihfllli - KIIIIIUIIII,III When are we coming off'? I have never seen anything as boring as tonight. What's the matterwith you'? Everybody knows it's coming off, Bill Well I don't know it's coming off and I'm the fucking producer! And even if it is coming off, who's to blame? We're supposed to be doing a play of our times here, the golden age But does it look like it'? Does it buggery! It looks like some creaky old piece by George Bernard Shaw 'Iljiili -filfllllll.fillfilfll'kll QIIIQD. Ylllili, I'll!!! I mean we can do anything as long as it's not boring! Hello Bill, didn't know you were in EIIillTUIII-GIH Illii They opened up the theatres again Science, poetry, Dryden, Milton, actors and actresses... Wren, St Paul's, music, Purcell I mean Purcell...

English! I want none of your Vingt Quatres here! L, Captain Henry Cooke, say it as Master ofthe Children ofthe Royal Chapel... you, Harry Purcell, are destined... do you but stay obedient and compliant and do betterwith yourviol... and your fingering I hate the viol! Its use is to strengthen a part, to support the voices A chest of viols is essential in church when the people cannot sing in tune I would always have my people sing in tune... and rest the voices... and then use my violins Fiddles! Too brisk! What can a fiddle say alongside a generous heroic viol... except it should not come among them'? Fingering... Fingering, Harry! Fret and finger, orwe shall banish cornets with voices now we have 'em... to the Glory of God and the King and to... I shall say it... to Prosperity! This is a music factory But make people feel, Master Purcell Give them lessons in feeling. Let 'em think afterwards Now in some countries this might be thought a dangerous approach... But not in England, not today, dear heart What? Little danger of people feeling too much Not in England, not today... encircled as we are with a Cromwellian army of prigs... knighthood-seekers and grubby timeservers... fat delayers of the law Blackheads... who merely shrug their shoulders... while their money meters tick merrily away... whose wealth is a licence for calumny... whose cupidity passes for concern To fly from love's sickness is both foolish and vain For I am myself my own fever and pain What are you talking about'? I gave it all to her, Mother bloody Hubbard... when I left her, you know So many children, she didn't know what to do Inn-quantum: 4n. I'm not in the mood, not anymore. You brought up money! Well, if you don't get on and write the bloody play... this poor Nelly will definitely starve If only it were as easy as that Do you know, last night I had the same dream I've been having all these years I'm about to make my entrance on a stage Behind the flats, the other actors are performing a play I know nothing about A play about the short life and tragic death of Henry Purcell... Composer in Ordinary to the violins of King Charles ll I play the King - Of course My entrance is important, that I know I'm peering through cracks in the scenery, trying to find out what is going on Eventually I decide I must have missed my entrance... so I grab a door handle and push Everything rattles... and suddenly I'm in a world were I can't see anything Even though I knowthe spotlight is on me I don't know my moves or my first line... but I make enormous efforts to speak, to say... something I open my mouth and drive all the strength I can find into my diaphragm... but I make no sound Ilflhifillflj- IIICI I can feel the light... but I cannot see Dreams won't pay the bloody rent! Sod you! Sod you! How much'?

Harold Wilson, is it'? I've always smoked a pipe. There's a kind of... spirituality about a pipe, rarely found in love... but occasionally in friendship You won't find anything on Purcell, I've searched everywhere I found that for you in the London Library I mean, nothing - that's what makes him an ideal subject for a play Nobody knows anything about him, except "Nymphs and Shepherds" I could play a shepherd and Nelly could play a nymph No seriously, Charlie, you can make it all up... we'll get George to put it on and we'll make you a star! We could even get an Arts Council grant - Means-test Man! We can get Guy to play King James, Vernon can do Spratt... and Murray can play... thingy... what's he called'?

There's even a mystery there Who paid for the inscription next to Purcelis grave'? Lady Howard, possibly We know when he died; St Cecilia's Day - the patron saint of music - probably of tuberculosis, possibly of chocolate poisoning We don't know when orwhere he was born... whether his father was actually his uncle... uunlnnnl-'uu. mun One thing we are sure about is that he owed everything to Charles ll XIfiflfi-fllfi -$I Yes, you. You wouldn't even be remembered. Who remembers tarts unless they get to screw somebody famous? "No sleep as sweet as thine" Isn't he pretty'? Aren't you pretty'? Vot'? Vellington'?

No matter the lack of money The theatres were flung open, news-sheets flung up... poetry written, music heard I had the occasional success myself But it was the actresses which took the King's eye Most chief among these was pretty, witty Nell... with whom I had some dalliance myself before Charles the King... but that's another story Oh, poet. Damned dull poet! Who could prove so senseless as to make Nelly die for love'? Nay, what yet worse, to kill me in the prime of Easter time... in tart and cheesecake time! And a mighty pretty soul she is! Bloody freezing Yes, my dear Barbara, you have every right to ask me to support you What do you want'? Money, I suppose Would be a help Writing a play, I hear Well, trying to, you know... Writers dissemble, you know. Like you They're not to be trusted. Like you They look for intellectual respect and approbation. Like you They flatter, indulge, and offer false and easy comfort. Like you Once, our native language was refined and free... like the old liturgy ofthe Anglican Church, or Pepys, Dryden, Purcell - each of whom tried to find a vibrant language in which it was possible only... to tell the truth That, I believe, is worthy and worth our attention It's for her, I suppose. The starving Nelly'? No, it's for me. It's about Purcell Anything in it for me'? - I wouldn't think so It's about genius... Welcome to Her Majesty's Royal Palace and fortress, the Tower of London... and in particular to the Wakefield Tower, usually known as the Jewel Tower Here you see in the first case Her Majesty's Crown Jewels Here, of course, is St Edward's crown... used in the Coronation of all our Sovereigns ever since 1661 when the Crown was made specifically for King Charles ll On the right of St Edward's crown, of course, is the ampula and spoon The ampula was filled with holy oil... to anoint our Sovereign during the Coronation service The Crown weighs five pounds in gold... and is encrusted with over 400 precious stones - diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, rubies and what have you What we'll take you to now is the Imperial State Crown, which is much smaller Come on, this way now Iiijflllflfi-l-i DQIIIIZ Were these paid for'? - No they were not Cost me, his goldsmith, 32,000 - mine by rights Oh, but he was merry Sank ten fathoms deep all Parliament's mumping Pure gold Sire, you'll stop on and take the other bottle'? Upon my soul I do declare... he hath the best manner of singing in the world! Butch, the plague! It came every year, and fearwith it 1665 was the worst - the hottest summer in memory, my memory And mine it is that shrinks from it, from the numbers dead Halfthe population of London... gone. Cut down, like a flower Even the dogs, grisly outlaws of nature, killed 40,000 of them The Dutch brought it, your Majesty, they had it first! It come ashore with the Dutch and now we all dies, your Majesty! Filllllflillllj 'Ii- and so many sad stories as I walk A dying city. All fled who can Bring out your dead! In London Fields in Hackney they buried them Harry's father among them - in a pit They say the ravens are beating at the doors ofthe dying No boats upon the river The grass is growing all up and down Whitehall None but wretches in the street Spots... first... do generally appear in the region ofthe heart and liver Or the breast or... - No, no, everywhere Tokens big is half a crown... sometimes red with blue within, on hands, face, neck Black they go, black from melancholy Robbery and thievery, the looting of plunder... public hangings... bonfires to purify the stinking air, everywhere, everywhere... So short a time... Since I have so short a time to live... a little ease to these my torments give A land of confusion and endless night... where horror reigns, where darkness is might Take up the filth from among us as ye take our sins from us we do but plead... and shit from us the plague of popery! The best remedy, apart from tobacco... is wash out the mouth with vinegar often... and rosemary, sorrel, verjuice, marigolds... all these stuff in the cracks and holes ofthe body when abroad All had from a physician before he decamped to Gloucester, the coward The king goes to see the wretched sick and gives a thousand pounds... Oh, bless him... even though... Even though he will not pay for music Even though he loves it And then the fire destroyed halfthe city Master Pepys, Master Pepys! Hllfl-illfllllilllfllll, hllilllll I saw some smoke, but went back to bed... for the source being assuredly no more near than the backside of Marke Lane Our Lord Mayor neither, I am told, saw cause for concern His words: "A maid may piss it out" Well Jane certainly could not! There are some buckets being filled but no fire squirts nor cistern engines All simply remove themselves Will it reach up here'? Jaws clamped shut, singing boys! Do not expose your throats to the heat! Breathe not but through stuff! Pull us away, boatman, orwe'll burn up on the water! Muffle boys, muffle! Your cords are everything! No sooner are we free of Cromwell and can have boys sing again... than the flames of his hell lick up at us Such a roaring was never seen in the city before Oh, do you see his Majesty? Jamie, they must pull the houses down before it. ls it not being done'? Oh, they will not They must do it or the fire will never be stopped. Where is my Lord Mayor'? Having his daughter piss on it'? I have fought in his wars, for his father's righteous cause! The decree has gone out! Repent or burn! Squash another murderous Frenchman as should never have been born alive! See his black hands where he has set light to London ls the popish villain left his life yet'? Enough! Enough! - N0 pOpery, your Majesty! I see nothing that pertains to the man's religion It will suffice that he is French - Indeed it will, for him Set to it like no ordinary men or your city will burn itself to death! Seize me that bucket. Ted, toss it to me, man My Lord Clarendon, these flames quicken They will not thank him for it... but blame him and the religion he is secret supposed to hold! What he do or not do, he has my loyalty... in spite ofthe money he owes me He has not paid his music in six years which is why no man will bring his child in it So it need be that the science itself must die in this nation! Six years! Six years since you went to King's crowning! God save the King! God save the King! I promised a liberty to tender consciences... and this shall be a cause and reason for my six new colonies in the Americas Maryland I name in memory of my mother, Maria... New York for my brother James, Duke of York... and the Carolinas and Charles Town for me Why did you make me go on that... march'? You're always telling me that Charles ll had to endure plots and demonstrations... not to mention fire and plague... so I thought you ought to see what a real demo is like! You're one ofthose militants that exploits political crises for personal glory You're both psychopathic and self-righteous! Ah, no! My book! "My Pilgrim's book has travelled sea and land, yet could l never come to understand... that it was slighted or turned out of door by any kingdom, were they rich or poor In France and Flanders, where men kill each other... my Pilgrim is esteemed a friend, a brother 'Tis in New England under such advance receives there so much loving countenance... as to be trimmed, new clothed and decked with gems... that it might show its features and its limbs" Who is that'? As Treasurer, you should know ...goldsmiths and bankers of Lombard Street... to whom your Majesty owes £1 ,300,000 That is a very great sum, my lord. What might we do'? Prorogue Parliament, close the Exchequer... all interest on payments stopped, all interest due on loans refused Splendid! War, pestilence, fire, and now... Damn me if we ain't ruined! Was ever a city so afflicted 4,000 streets destroyed, 90 churches, 14,000 houses... Architecture has its political uses, my lord... “I-Qmllll-l-I ulnuly But the cost, your Majesty What Master Wren has designed will cost eight million! At least! It establishes the Nation, draws People and Commerce... and makes men love their native country So he built all ofthis... - More or less And why the boat'? Oh, he and his brother used to love racing up and down the Thames, just for a bet He was a fantastic sailor, apparently He called his boat "The Fubbs" after the nickname of his mistress - one of his mistresses, the Duchess of Portsmouth She was small and squat and broad of beam... like you Cheeky bugger! How many did he have then'? What? - Women Howwould I know? - I don't know... Thought you are looking him up, writing a play or something Stop it, keep your hands to yourself if you're not going to be nice He was accused of having 39 Even had up before a church court to answer some pamphlet written about him "The Poor Whore's Petition", it was called Scurrilous - It may be, but... The temper of England may be indifferent to religion, my Lord Bishop... but I... lam not! Is it true, Majesty? Certainly, my Lord Bishop One mistress for each Article of Faith There are 39, are there not'? Such is my devotion to our Church of England Weigh your anchors! Time and tide admit no delay l'll silence your mourning with vows of returning and never intend to visit you more! What are you going to do today'? What Charles wanted and what Purcell wrote about so gloriously... was a country of tolerance, irony, kindliness Not like today, when the modesty of heroes is dispatched with derision and contempt... and thus thrown up a generation forwhom "honour" is a forgotten, meaningless currency May God rot the tyranny of equality... streamlining, classlessness... and above all, absurd, irrelevant "correctness" That's just a matter of opinion and you know it! Ah, opinions! Do you knowthat opinion-making is this country's most virulent growth industry The market is insatiable Newspapers, like television, pour out opinions... with a frenzy that marked the production of Spitfires during the war Phone-ins proliferate, choked with calls from the semi-literate, the bigoted and the barmy Opinion polls, the entrails of democracy, are picked over for prophetic insights We've become a nation of babbling backseat cab-drivers "What are you giving up for Lent?" I was asked yesterday "Opinions", I said. "Permanently!" Ha bloody ha! Well, to answer your earlier question, I'm off to the British Library Want to come'? You could pick up... an education! The London Gazette, October 9th, 1701 "The score ofthe music for the Fairie Queen, set by the late Mr Henry Purcell... and belonging to the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden in London... being lost by his death... Whoever brings the said score to Mr Zachary Baggs... treasurer of the said theatre, shall have 2O guineas reward give him! God, the actual score Good for Mr Baggs! I hope he paid up 2O guineas for such a priceless manuscript, eh'? "The Fairie Queen, first performed May 2nd, 1692" Some of it in PurcelPs own hand... so clear, so beautiful... What's this'? "We play loud or soft, according to our fancy, or the mood ofthe music" Blank pages! "Here follows..." But what'? What on earth did they do'? "Let kindness be our guide..." "The irony of love... The tolerance of hope" "Still and soften the sound as shades in needlework..." Give an actor directions like that and he'll do what he likes Make it up as he goes along! Ififlliillflllil From hence you may... From hence you may look back on Civil Rage and viewthe ruins of a former age Here a New World its glories may unfold... and here be saved the remnants ofthe old But while your days on public thoughts are bent... past ills to heal, and future to prevent... some vacant hours allow to your delight... mirth is the pleasing business of the night Hush, hush, no more Be silent Sweet repose has closed her eyes Soft as feathered snow does fall Softly, softly... Softly Hard by Pall Mall lives a wench called Nell... King Charles the Second he kept her She hath got a trick to handle his prick... but never lays hands on his sceptre! Where did you get that'? Said at the time, sweetheart, a lot of scurrilous poetry about at the time And dirty ditties too - Purcell wrote quite a few Just imagine what he must have seen growing up... in that stew of "luxury and inexpressible profaneness" By the time he came of age... young Harry was already well established at the court Organist at Westminster Abbey... Composer in Ordinary like his uncle before him... Keeper of the Kings fiddles Still with his boyhood friend, Pelham Still a boy himself I remember, I remember... You Harry... - I shall not! If not you, then I must and I cannot for I am just married myself... and not an instant would I spend away from it Marriage... Oh do, Harry, what will you learn, the King commands it! L-low does he'? - He commands me and I command you It's French! - It is 'I'llH§1IIKfll'KIl, BID But not this... "The Marriage of Bacchus"! Does he hate his brother so much he would give him this is a wedding gift'? No, no, no. This rivalry... between the King's Company and his brother's... James? Well, he ne'er troubled his head with too much thinking If his brotherwants a French play, then so must Charles The cost of it! London is not big enough for two theatre companies, I tell you Isn't she wonderful? Wonderfully large, she certainly is Isn't she French'? Much the same as you were, your first week back from Paris In the King's service, Harry, the Secret Service I remember it well, the complete Monsieur Monsieur Pefam Umfraise ofthe Chapel Royal, full of Moliére... I 'ave eeet - I will 'ave 'er, sir! - Thought you might, Monsieur I can't play it, Monsieur, I can't play this! Too many notes... impossible! And could he, it would be dreary and incomprehensible There may be some merit... - None, I shall not! All human things are subject to decay So when Fate summons, e'en a Monarch must obey And yet, a setting sun describes a track of glory in the skies The King was grown old Only his horses at Newmarket seemed to please him Did I tell you'? He founded the great stables at Newmarket Champion jockey he was, with his brother, James James, waiting, watching... ullQillllilllii iiliflfll- so whistled as he went, for want of thought hlQHIIIilllllll Iilii- to be the heir, yet always made to wait What Charles wanted was for the Crown itself to be extraordinary... Not like today... when the monarchy isn't even the tarnished gold fillings in a mouthful of decay The rot set in, of course, with Queen Victoria That no-neck little widow who spent most ofthe 6O glorious years of her reign... skulking behind closed portcullis doors, leading a life of ineffable dullness... snapping at her huge family and foreign relations Her husband, quite understandably, thought she was mad The King still loved the ladies of course. The latest being Mistress Louise... the "Duchess" of Portsmouth whom he had known for some time... but who was French, Catholic - and called "Fubbs" Why'? I was never able to discover Her son, the "Duke" of Richmond, also founded a racecourse I'm told... at Goodwood Butch, a merry Monarch, scandalous but poor... restless he rolled about from whore to whore And he still loved his music, though he did not pay for it Young Harry was always with him - and with him... his new lady, Frances - to provide a welcome ode or an anthem, whatever was required No matter that plot and counterplot... the scourge of violence lurked everywhere, t'other side of the hangings Remember'? Returns it to the memory'? The great pope-burning processions... Does the memoryjog'? Bread and carnivals... Few took them seriously The King knew men to a hair and never let them forget it Do you see them, of his loins not one legitimate He has peopled the aristocracy of England! The Queen is barren He should rid himself of her lf he will not, he must declare you Duke of Monmouth and his heir As first born, bastard or no, you could be King, young man The tragedy was that the King had no children of his own No legitimate children His bastard son, Monmouth, was always plotting against him He loved his son, but he was not his heir He was not the Crown Nature and Nature's Laws lay hid in night... 'til God said: "Let there be Newton" And all was... light! Yes, the honour is... Overwhelming'? - No, I am not overwhelmed I am perfectly capable of arranging the music... for the announcement of the wedding of your niece, the Princess Mary... hfiflfliilll-IIXQ Iii and I am... Overwhelmed'? Your Majesty, may I humbly submit... Ah, Squire Dryden "lf love and honour now are higher raised, 'tis not the poet, but the age is praised Wit's not arrived to a more high degree... our native language more refined and free" XIII, KI, CUEI-IIQ Dhlfil- take this man, William, as your dearly beloved husband'? And wilt thou, William Henry, Prince of Orange... take this woman, Mary, as your dearly beloved wife'? With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship... and with all my worldly goods I thee endow I now pronounce ye man and wife, till death do ye part Gather it up girl, it is all clear gain Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder You have to get used to my habits! We may have to live together for a long while! Have you told the King'? - Told the King'? I don't talk to the King, unless he talks to me, which... on the matter of my marriage to Frances, which we are determined shall... We are determined ulna mining I shall take the sacrament Look... She, you Frances, are Flanders and Catholic Harry here, now he is... Well, he's not Dryden is, certainly, but now we are none of us of... Ofthe old religion - Dare not be The King is... secretly You must not say that. That is not true The nation would be rent were it so again Up and down the land we would... Oh, it would be awful, as it was You may not remember how we were at throats... Englishmen at the throats of other Englishmen We will be married We are married in love Well... I shall not tell the King Oh, do take care Master Purcell From this blessed man, music just seemed to flow Motets, anthems, songs... all manner of music for all manner of occasions There was no dam, no stop to his golden flask He was... unstoppable What do it say'? - Vivace What do it mean'? - Fast and brisk Why don't you say so, young man'? Ain't it French enough for you'? What do I 'grave down here Adagio, if you would take the very great kindness, sir 'IIQIHQKIDIIIJ - K Oddsfish, do you mean to set that? - Yes Oh, how your brothers, Charlie and... Joe'? Are they still travelling abroad - They must, they promised the King... "for he commandeth and raiseth up the stormy wind... which lifteth up the waves thereof, and we near to drowned" Very good! You can set that... as long as you promise to abandon your detestable viols! What, and achieve a fiddle? Oh, Harry, Harry, Harry... I will travel no more I resolve that I shall go abroad no more It's unimaginable, who would think it or plot it'? Some would, some do But then I am beset by plots, am I not, my Lord Shaftesbury'? When I die... - God save your Majesty! ...l know not what my brother might do I am much afraid that he may be obliged to travel again, for his religion... But I shall take care to leave my kingdom at peace... wishing that he may long keep it so But these are all my fears, little of my hopes and less of my reason I tell you... poets... that one... my bastard, pretty Prince Perkin... will be put on the throne by the Protestants... by the Whigs, under Shaftesbury - the loudest bagpipe in the squeaky train You must fight Shaftesbury for me, you must fight popery too I'm so weary Do excuse me for taking such a long time a-dying Doomsday, my Lord Shaftesbury, we shall see whose arse is blackest Listen awhile and I'll tell you a tale... of a little device called the Protestant flail This flail is made ofthe finest new wood... for the splitting of brains and the shedding of blood With a thump-a-thump thump, a thump-a-thump thump... Come out, you papist whore! Pray good people, be civil! The King's whore I may be, but I'm his Protestant whore! Among the Loyalist people, I am your spokesman... and by the grace of God nobody will silence me l, Titus Oates, tell you Lords, there is a popish plot in the land... for the destruction of his Majesty King Charles... and that man, he, Lord Stafford, he took from me a commission... that I was give by Jesuits... that he should act as Paymaster General of the Pope's army... to ravage this land! ...like the prigs and bullies who would now would have dominion over our daily lives All ofthis will have to go, you know No one will put up with all this violence, not on the telly anyway No one will put up the money to make the thing Violence'? What about the violence of threatened profit? The great English bourgeoisie... who claim to believe in the virtue of "leaving things alone"... but whose objectives narrow down to a painful sore of human undernourishment'? Those are the people, the "disgusted of Tunbridge Wells"... who are, in reality, possessed of the real violence... the greedy desire to order the lives of all... especially those who speak out of turn... the sexually immoral - they think - like King Charles... or those who simply blaze forth their youth... like Purcell, Newton, Wren, the whole lot of 'em Then is the voice of Jeremiah heard loud and clear in the land... or at least in the columns of the Daily Telegraph! You're just a bloody socialist! - Socialist? Ha! To be a socialist today, my dear old Bill... is like being in the priesthood in a world without God... still trying to remember the Order of Service... prattling ceaselessly about the "classless society"... to a middle class it dare not defy And what are you doing'? Trying to tune into God'? No, the Overseas Service. We've got a play on, remember? This is London... Well, at least the BBC hasn't forgotten the Empire! Oh, no. I'm dogged by that bloody tune They've whistled it, sung it, jeered it up and down the length ofthe land Blood will flow from it, l'll warrant, before we have our quietude again It's become an incitement, never an accompaniment... I can't hold myself responsible It is believed the man Oates lies It's not believed there was any plot at all I shall use it as a ground since that requires so littlejudgment And you would set "Richard ll", the tale of a usurper l have renamed it "The Sicilian Usurper". None shall know Bejudge yourself, I'll bring it to the test Which is the basest creature, man or beast? Birds feed on birds, beasts on each other prey... but savage Man alone does Man betray The winter which came in 1684 was savage The Thames froze over The King became gravely ill We were all afraid I'm going blind I shall write no more I've written none of my diary for years This stinking city, very little food neither Because of the ice... They've arrested that pygmy, Shaftesbury, you know A glittering worm in excrement I am going blind, you know... Did you never hear the tale ofthe starving soldier... who was fighting in the Holy Crusade'? He was told by his officer that if he died in battle... he would dine in Paradise with the blessed Jesus Well, the soldier ran away, he didn't want to fight And when he returned after the battle... the officer asked him why he had run away "Did you not want to dine with Christ?" he asked And the soldier replied, "No, I'm fasting today... fretting my pygmy body to decay" Which body... they strung up It's my blindness, you know We smelled death in the air Harry's firstborn... died IIll-uihpl-ll'. lilfli Young Harry worked on, worked on... Asked to judge which was the best organ in the land! I ask you! Oh, what an absurdity at times does possess us... I ask you! A most unwarrantable act of hostility! Since there is only one organ may be played, perhaps we should play it The King is dead! Dead! A Prince of so many virtues... Gracious on... so many occasions Oh, hide me, Frances. Hide me Hide me from the light of day And with the new King marched General Disorder The theatre in confusion - riots, hangings... The stink of revolution once again in the air Fear stalked the land in dread of what we thought might come Men set their door against the setting sun "ifllllq! -$I Ever'? - What about'? You know... they're arresting those who did... We have a Catholic King on the throne - Yes, but will he pay his debts? They say the Queen's Benedictines are costing 1,500 a year I fear this may well be the end of my church music I fear it may Why sleeps the viol and the lute'? Why hangs untuned the idle lyre'? They are come for us! - No, no, there's no need to be afraid Henry Purcell, Composer in Ordinary to the King's Music'? I'm still that'? Clerk ofthe Cheque Extraordinary to His Majesty King James... Colonel Wharton at your service, sir I shall want a receipt, sir Monies for repairing the King's instruments before his Coronation What is it'? From the King - out of the Secret Service money - 34 pounds and 12 shillings... for erecting an organ! But life continued, it always does l'_"_~h_' i_ n And while others fluttered in the wind... he stood shoulder to shoulderwith those he loved and with those who loved him Tell me, you Gods... why do vain men pursue with endless toil each object that is new... and cast aside that which they know is true'? Paid for erecting an organ! What art thou, what art thou'? Confess! Giovanni Draghi. At your service, sir Too many Italians at Court! There's nothing wrong with being Italian. Italians are now in favour at Court I'm very proud to be Italian And I'm very proud to admit ajust imitation of your Italian Masters... who do bring seriousness and gravity into vogue, nay reputation... against the levity and balladry of our neighbours, the French! None may sing as low as my gosling He called me his gosling Oh do fill up my bowl... 'IIILHQIIIIIIIIQ I11- For God' s sake, sing us a catch... We must play - What? Blind man's buff! The 107th Psalm.

Yodrejealous, that's all! - Of yourwork'? Come on! Jealousy, that poisons passion... - And despair that dies for love Yes, I have read the beginning of your rotten little play, you know Rotten? Little? Do you know what this country has become'? Once we had a church built upon a rock Nowthe rock has been bulldozed and with it our faith What we're left with is a crawling underside... of expediency and dishonour, beholden to Brussels... wherein the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain England, my England, is shuffling about like an old tramp... begging for a pair of boots at the tradesman's entrance of Europe Europe is the future and you know it! "Europe" is an adroit piece of brand-name dropping... which will turn democracy into a hoax - a Masonic Lodge of Commerce with a squalid membership of political mercenaries The English conscience, for so many years out for hire or rent... is now up for outright purchase The "Common Market"... is about as drab a name for such a monumental swindle... since some bright little German ad-man... thought of putting wholesale murder onto the market as National Socialism And then, another miracle... Without a blow, James was gone... prised out by the old aristocracy which was Protestant... and would not tolerate him any more... and went to his daughter, Mary, and her husband, William of Orange... who landed at Torbay, to general acclaim assured See the flags and streamers curling... anchors weighing, sails unfurling! Where is the Queen? Oh, do hurry up! It seemed a new and glorious age had arrived And for young Harry'? You are to receive all your monies, Master Purcell I am honoured, Majesty There is great want among the music There is great want in the Nation, Master Purcell For peace and prosperity, Majesty, there is a great yearning There is a great yearning, Master Purcell, for martial music Oboes and trumpets, Master Purcell William... will want you to write martial themes... such as "Sound the Trumpet", "Beat the Drums"... written, I believe, for my father the late King, James that is... so lately fled these shores Oh, you have but to command, Majesty Oh, but I do command, Master Purcell I command you to celebrate this... triumphant day, Master Purcell These sums of money, Mr Purcell... taken for admission to the organ loft for a better sight of the Coronation... are the right ofthe Abbey so to accrue, sirrah! Sirrah me not, Doctor Sprat! You may be Dean ofthe Abbey but I am in considerable station myself You are a minder ofthe instruments, sir and have no right to collect any monies. 11131111. -1lil I am Composer in Ordinary! Organist, Copyist, and person of considerable worth A musician born to the Chapel Royal like my father and uncle also... my life lived here, my work for this place You will pay back every penny, sirrah! I shall not It is my perquisite as it has been the perquisite of every organist... You shall give all the money to Mr Needham, sir... or in default you will lose your place, Master Purcell! Beware, Saul to Endor comes... lam being dunned I am pursued for debt... damned for my religion! They say I must pay back the money I had for letting places in the organ loft It's always been done. I have the right I shall not Though my debts be such that I shall lose my house Many do boom and bust, these times... Nothing at the Court. Not any more The stage is the thing - for both of us I knewthat when I saw"Dioclesian" I said, here is an Englishman equal to anyone abroad! Did I not'? And here I have something... None need know "King Arthur", originally written for King Charles Too many words, too little action n~_u*'l'lluhlu- Illih ' I always thought we should have done that. Lancelot and Guinevere... and Merlin - great part for you! Words are free, Bill. Conscience is cheaper It will not serve! My brother Edward serves - in TyrconnePs Regiment in Ireland It has within it subversion and religion... and mention ofthe King's defeat at Mons, which is not politic nor is it true Nor may you say he has a mistress! - I say none ofthis, I simply set it It is a work for the theatre... an opera! Opera is a danger you will do best to avoid! "King Arthur"... an opera, written by Mr Dryden... was excellently adorned with scenes and machines... with dances made by Mr Josias Priest, at a total cost of a mere £3000! The musical part set by the famous Mr Purcell... whose yearly salary was £1 O0... with Lady Mary Tudor most excellently undressed as Cupid! The play and music pleased the Court and City... and being well performed, it was very gainful to the company It was awful, wife It was not heard for machinery, sliding shutters... roar of cannon, blast of trumpets and flights of... parrots! Betterton wants to do "The Fairie Queen". From Shakespeare. With text by that oaf, Sedley... the father ofthe late King's mistress, Mistress Catherine What of the Queen'? What of the Queen'? She clasped her hands... and smiled at me with such... such consideration Did she though'? And then she died - Who'? The Queen. Mary. Almost overnight Taken sick and died within a week A statistical survey ofthe health ofthe late 17th century... reveals that from every hundred births... only one in three lived beyond the age of six Queen Anne had 18 children. All died He cometh up, and is cut down like a flower Only one in 1O lived until they were 7O The most common disease was rickets, resulting in deformed limbs and scrofula... while spotted fever, pleurisy, pneumonia and above all, smallpox... killed two out of every five ofthe population The first symptoms of smallpox are shivering... followed by red spots on the skin, a rapid rise in temperature... vomiting, headaches, intolerance to light, a swollen tongue... haemorrhage of the skin, a tearing pain... and death Regular bleeding, by cutting into the patienfs veins... is thought to alleviate the suffering, although only temporarily Suffer us not at our last hour from any pains of death to fall from Thee... I fear I am becoming old... and infirmities come with age Where is my husband'? - Returning from Ireland, your Majesty I long for rest and peace A lion has died, you know At Christmas A lion died when Charles... the King... Remember me... and may my wrongs create no trouble in thy breast No trouble in thy breast She was only 32 He fleeth as it were a shadow Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts Shut not Thy merciful ears unto our prayers... but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty... Her death broke young Harry. At least, that is my view He tried his best to revive his "Dido", not one of mine, but some say his best But he had no money, you see, so he had to play Belinda himself What irony that was My girls, Master Purcell! My girls, my nymphs, my shepherds! What can be done, Master Purcell? Cut them out, Mr Priest! Belinda, the loyal servant of a Queen, who dies for love I told you, when we first did this, some four years back... although we did it in private, as we do now... cut them out! They are a mediocrity! The King would cut everything out, especially his musicians! Ever gentle, ever smiling... and the cares of life beguiling, Mr Priest. Begumng! Beguiling! Our world was disintegrating We moved as in a dream, shadows without substance Thus did our life become. 'Tis all a cheat Yet, fooled with hope, men favour the deceit Trust on, and think tomorrow will repay Tomorrow is falser than the former day So when the last and dreadful hour... this crumbling pageant shall devour... shall the trumpet still be heard on high'? No! The dead shall live, the living die... while music shall untune the sky No government has ever been or ever can be... wherein Timeservers and Blackheads will not be uppermost The persons only are changed The samejuggling in the State, the same hypocrisy in Religion The same self-interest and mismanagement will... remain... for ever Suffer us not at our last hour... from any pains of death to fall from Thee Harry was inconsolable His heart screamed for peace, ifthat is what it was... and he sought it in a hospital called Bethlehem... among the mad of Bedlam These poor souls, he told me, had seen the light What light? Had they seen those shadows which we could not see, could only feel Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our heart Shut not thy merciful eyes from our prayers... but spare us Lord most Holy, God most mighty England, my England! Do you know what this country has become'? And old tramp shuffling around... begging for a pair of boots at the tradesman's entrance of Europe! Oh, but I do command, Master Purcell I command you to celebrate this triumphant day! Master Purcell... When we first did this, although we did it in private as we do now... I told you then, cut them out! They are a mediocrity! Still... mediocrity is a great comforter You'll see I will become a grand object of public unconcern My Dido'? Not even performed. At least not in public Since "Dioclesian", some 5O works for the stage in only four years And the result? Penury. Begging for enough to... Tell me, is this ugly, cheerless world in which we live... supposed to be typical'? Is this all'? Well, at least you never assembled a lot of sloppy fads... and served them up as innovations I mourned the unknown, the loss of what went before... the deprivation of what, even as a child, seemed irrevocably my own... my birthplace... my country... 1111i, Ilflflflfflil Have I looked for answers where there are none'? Everyone demands answers, like happiness, as a right How hopeless! How... ironic Ah, irony! That English virtue that purifies our rowdy passion No. Hope comes from within, my friend When hope goes, we freeze Hope falters, but never fawns or crowds, never stands in line Even in dread and noise it strains for coherence, for a snatch of harmony An old trumpet, played upon but not playing - sounding, but only in my head Alas... coherence conceals as much as it reveals to the lost, like me... who contemplate the wreckage Frances! Let me in! L lived among the hills footmarked here... rooted here, in ancient English time Frances, will the King ever pay our debts'? Two hundred, isn't it'? At 2O pence a day, it's little wonder... "'Tis women make us love, 'tis loving makes us sad... 'tis sadness makes us drunk, and drinking makes us mad" ls it not St Cecilia's Day tomorrow? L shall write a Comical History... of Don Quixote Pray for me He was a Colossus, the boy It flew up from him Notes, everything - they'll not find the half of it Did he not give to the Englishman his glorious, unquenchable music? There'll be none like him "Remember me" It's gone up. The notice Ah, when'? This is the last week Good. I'm very tired of it. You'? And I've got a coffee commercial Did you get that film'? "...and forget my fate" Still, never mind, there's always your play That's if you ever finish it, though There's always the telly... gunman “flit! Only from established authors, I'm told
