(PHONE RINGING) ROCKFORD ON ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Jim Rockford. At the tone, leave your name and message. I'll get back to you. (BEEPS) Jim, it's Paul. Hey, I have been waiting two months for that invitation, buddy. Are you gonna get that new sports channel before the Rams leave LA? Nothing. Absolutely nothing! Unless this is a movie about the Donner party, we're not getting it. You know, the game's gonna start any minute. There's that little sucker, way back there. You know, this TV ought to be in the Smithsonian. Yeah. I'm gonna get all the sports channels on this cable system, right? Yeah, and the little woman's gonna be threatening to divorce you within a week. My little woman jumped that fence seven years ago. Get all the movie channels, too? Yep. (WOMAN MOANING ON TV) (KISSING) WOMAN: That's it. Is that what you were looking for? He's pretty good, this guy. They've been running it all week. He ends up with her and the upstairs maid on the kitchen table. (MAN MOANING) Well, he should forget about acting and put out a line of vitamins. (LAUGHS) Yeah. Okay. Well, you're all hooked up. Have fun. And if you have any problems, you just give Image Cable a call and we'll be out here before you can say "Geronimo." That must've been my problem. I didn't say "Geronimo." I just said please and waited five months. Well, we've been busy. Enjoy. MAN ON TV: 'Cause this sale ends Sunday! (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING) ANGEL ON TV: Let me in. Yeah. Come on in, Angel. Door is open. ANGEL: Let me into your life. AUDIENCE: Hallelujah! Let me see your devastation, touch your withered limbs, heal your soul. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Refresh your tortured spirit. Let me banish the vile residue of destruction. I take away the pain and the suffering, not in my name, but in the name of Him. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Lordy! God's work is merciful. AUDIENCE: Amen. The Temple of the Holy Light, it needs your support. Yes, we do! Remember, the angel of the temple, he gives your offerings, he doesn't take. He took it. That's my sports jacket. That's where it went. Now, your offerings, they're for the children. We collect God's gifts for them. I have here, item number 357, entitled, "You are my special angel." CHOIR: (SINGING) You are my special angel This pamphlet tells my story. It tells how this special angel walked the path to salvation. Salvation! It's easy. It's fun reading. It's a short pamphlet. It'd have to be. ANGEL: But it will get your soul singing. Item 357. Mail your checks to the Temple of Holy Light. Uh, Temple of Holy Light, please, and the address, if you can. ANGEL: ...God spake unto me. ROCKFORD: Okay. Thank you. You are my special angel. Yes. I want to talk to Angel Martin. Yes, I'll hold. ...and help them see. (EXCLAIMING) Yeah. I want to talk to Angel Martin, please. No, I don't want to send in a prayer pledge. I want to talk to... I'll hold. Your offerings, they go to help the starving children in Lapland. Lapland? Yes. Sister who? (LAUGHS) Well, this is silly, Sister Sunshine, but it seems the Reverend Martin is wearing my sports jacket on TV and I... (SIGHS) No, I'm not a giver. Yes, I'll hold! BROTHER BOB ON LOUDSPEAKER: May I have your attention, please? MAN: Listen up, everybody! BROTHER BOB: May I have your attention, please? We'd like all picketers to get your signs and begin loading onto the bus. We will begin our march on the Cineplex at 7:00. (PICKETERS CHEERING) PICKETER: Boycott Little Ezekiel! The Lord will punish infidels. Where can I park? These slots are for the first light deacons, and this one's Angel's choir and the Angels of the Lord. I had tickets for the LA Angels in '91. Barely used them. Does that help? You're not with the boycott, are you? I did lettuce and grapes years ago. On the street, pal. SISTER EVE: When the Reverend Martin enters the room, he will move to each one of you and he will ask you what miracle you desire. Then he will read your aura, so sit very, very still. Now, he'll only spend a few seconds with each one of you. Not to worry. That's all it takes for the reverend to get a spiritual reading. You'll be notified later if he's agreed to perform your miracle. Back again? And, my son, what miracle do you wish for this humble angel of the Lord to perform? I'd... I'd like my legs back. He wants his legs back. Hallelujah! Nice aura, very shiny, very blue. Wish you could see it, Sister Eve. What do you wish for, sister? What? What do you wish for, sister? I want my hearing back. She wants her hearing back. Holy! Holy! Elliptical aura. Very resonant. And what do you wish for, my son? I want my sport coat back. Hi, Jimmy. "Hi, Jimmy." Is that all I get? I don't get a Hosea? You don't want to read my aura? In case you can't see it, it's bright red and it's shaped like a fist. (PANTING) You hit a preacher, you're consigned to the depths of purgatory for eternity and a day. I'll risk the beef. Where's my sport coat? Jimmy, Jimmy! I'm here dealing with the poverty and the degradation of the human spirit, at war with the cloven-hoofed forces of the devil who strike out at the children of my flock. And while I look tirelessly for human redemption, all you can think about is your gray tweed Mr. Guy, one-button jacket with a single vent? In hopelessly long, convoluted sentences, that about covers it. I'm frightened for your soul. I'm frightened for your bridgework, Angel. All right. All right. I needed a good jacket for the pulpit. The old black and white check that I wore in court, well, it was strobing on TV, so I borrowed yours. You stole mine. Let's use the right verb. An object taken for the Lord's work is an offering, Jimmy. You get credit in heaven. How did this happen? The last time I saw you, you were... You were selling hot VCRs out of a supermarket shopping cart. (SHUSHING) Jimmy, Jimmy, this is so amazing, I'm having so much fun. I heal guys, I make them walk again. I'm selling little doohickeys on television. I boycott stuff. I'm signing autographs and I'm selling pamphlets about my life. And it's all tax free! (STAMMERING) Yeah, but how? I mean, how'd it happen? Well, one morning, I woke up and I had this vision. And in this vision, I was walking in a daze. Well, that's not a vision, Angel. That's your natural demeanor. Anyway, in this vision, God said to me, "Your name is Angel." That's strange? My name is Angel. And God told me, He said, "That's not a coincidence, it's a sign. "It's a message." Well, you can't ignore a message like that. Sure you can. Your name is Evelyn. They called you Angel in prison 'cause you were always on your knees, praying to hard cases not to kill you. Yeah. Well, I'd love to chew the prayer rag with you, but I got an interview with some hair and makeup people at 5:00. I had to can the old bunch. I was looking so pasty in my close-ups, I could've been doing spots for Forest Lawn. Besides, we got a boycott forming in the parking lot and we march on the Cineplex at 7:00. So, if you don't mind... This is His Holiness. Send in the Angels of the Lord. We need to help a sinner on his way. Now why do I have a hunch these angels won't have harps? (DOOR OPENING) Don't I know you? Zack, Zackary Irons. Didn't we do time together? You, me and His Holiness? I didn't like you in stir, Rockford, and I don't like you now. Hey, hey! (GRUNTS) Leave the reverend alone, or we're gonna put some hurt on you. You guys got a real rock and roll church going here. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) You little slut! Go sell your devil movie someplace else! Why are you doing this? I didn't do anything. I need to see Reverend Martin. We've heard your satanic message! We know what you stand for! Hey! Hey! Are you looking for somebody closer to your weight class, huh? I need to see Reverend Martin. He won't see me. I've tried three times. All right, this is not a very good situation. Let's get out of here. Where's your car? Hollywood makes pollution and pushes it off on our children. You are a part of the liberal sewage line. You spew godlessness on all of us! You haven't even seen the movie, bubba! Don't need to! Young lady... I already know what it's about. Oh, yeah? What are you doing? This is going to the cops, tough guy. Don't do that. Come on, let's get out of here. (CROWD CLAMORING) All right. All right. (GRUNTS) PROTESTOR 1: Don't let them get away! PROTESTOR 2: Somebody follow them! (SIGHS) Where are you parked? I'll sneak back and drop you. (CRYING) Hey! Hey! Come on, don't cry, please. Here. Here. Take this. There. On top of everything else, Laura Sue Dean Day got canceled. Can you believe that? I sent posters and show hats and everything. My mom just called from Topeka, Kansas, and told me they canceled the whole thing, the parade, the Laura Sue Dean look-alike contest, the barn dance, everything. Who the hell is Laura Sue Dean? That's me. I'm Laura Sue Dean, the actress. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, please. Don't cry, please. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? Oh, God, no, no! Please. Don't you know what that stuff does to you? Tannic acid, it ruins your stomach. Do you have a car? Where can I drop you? I took a cab. There's a juice bar a couple of blocks from here. Um, I could force down a cranberry and pineapple. Are my eyes red? Well, just a smidge. Oh, God! I hate when my eyes are red. My eyes are my best feature, don't you think? They're very nice. Where's this juice bar? Actually, I would rather have a coffee, if you won't tell anyone. God, I hope nobody recognizes me in here. My eyes must still look horrible. They're very nice. Why were those people pushing you around out there? I'm in Little Ezekiel. I play the mother. My agent said I was too young to play the mother, but when I heard that Guy Franklyn was playing Mark, the father, I said, "Come on. Guy Franklyn? He's only 26." I mean, if he's the father, how does it hurt me to be the mother? But my manager is just so concerned about career positioning and everything. But you have to take what comes until you get the big one. That's why I switched agencies. I'm with Worldwide Artists now. They're about the best. Miss Dean, do you think you could stay with the reason those people were pushing you around? I still don't understand. I'm in Little Ezekiel. Little Ezekiel is a movie? Yes. And the Reverend Martin is boycotting it, saying it's blasphemous. He says we're making fun of the scriptures because of the miracle of the bowling balls, and because Zeke parts the waters in the YMCA pool. But none of these guys have even seen it. And I tried to talk to Reverend Martin and tell him I'm being threatened and my career is being trashed, but he won't let me in. Let's back up a minute. The miracle of the bowling balls? Yes, okay. It's about this little boy named Zeke, who's trying to get his divorced mother and father back together and he wants them to believe that it's God's will, so he rigs these miracles. And his parents, they fall back in love and they get re-married... (MUSIC PLAYING ON TV) Oh, no! Oh! What? What? Oh, no. I don't believe it. What? The TV. The Sports Quencher ad. (EXCLAIMS) MAN ON TV: When you play hard... That's me, in the middle. When you play for keeps... (SCOFFS) I look 12. That hairdo did nothing for me. Oh, but that bikini was darling. I tried to buy it from wardrobe, but they said they had to keep it in case of retakes. MAN ON TV: ...kiwi, grapefruit, lemon lime. (SCOFFS) Because you're in this movie, they were pushing you around on the temple steps. That's it, huh? ...the drink your body craves. Laura Sue? Miss Dean? Huh? That's why they were pushing you around? Yes. I've also been getting these. Here. Let me show you. Oh, my God. How did this get in there? What? What's that? Just one of my reviews. I did Streetcar in La gun a. It says I was a vibrant and convincing Blanche. See, vibrant. It's one of my best qualities. I'm getting that. Yeah. Uh, you want to know another of your qualities, Miss Dean? (LAUGHS) What? You're very self-involved. Well, you have to be in this business. I mean, if you don't look after yourself, nobody else will. These people are threatening your life. You should take this to the cops. No, my producers don't want me to. They say it will just feed the story. (SCOFFS) Look, I have a client meeting. You're an agent? A private eye. Oh, that is so cool! Do you know how many bodyguards Kim Basinger has? I heard six. I heard 12, but I'm not a bodyguard. Aren't you gonna eat? I'm not hungry. Look! I just had a complete brainstorm. Already? I want to hire you to protect me. And I bet you I could get Milovan and Branka to pay for it, too, 'cause of these letters. Let me guess. Milovan and Branka have an animal act at the Stardust. Am I close? Milovan D'Sant and Branka Decosta. They own Acropolis Pictures. So, how about it? You want the gig? I don't think so. I've got money. If you don't believe me, I made a quarter of a million on Little Ezekiel. Oh, you made $250,000 playing the mother of a little boy who parts the water in the pool at the Y? And I could've got more, too, but I signed a two-picture deal and gave Acropolis a break on the first movie. MAN 1: That guy needs a paint job. MAN 2: Satan lover! (THUDDING) MAN 3: Blasphemer! Come on, I'll drop you someplace. MAN 2: Get the other side. ROCKFORD: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get out of here! What do you think you're doing? Stop it. (GRUNTS) LAURA SUE: Help, somebody! MAN 3: Blasphemer! Get off of him! Get off of him! (GROANS) (ROCKFORD MOANS) (SIREN WAILING) Get off! Get off! (GROANS) Are you okay? Yeah, are you? Yeah. You know, you have another great quality. What's that? Guts. I've got to get my hair done and a cute outfit before Morton Downey Jr. tonight. We're doing a show on Little Ezekiel. I'm not sure I should do it, but Branka and Milovan say we have to put the movie ahead of our personal safety. I guess that's show biz. Miss Dean, I know you got a lot on your mind, but since you haven't asked, my name is Jim Rockford. Oh, I was just getting to that. Nice to know you, Jim. I think these people are pretty dangerous. You ought to start thinking about another place to stay tonight. Yeah. I guess I could stay at M&M's. Who's M&M? Merrill Mark. He's my old agent. We're still friends. Yeah. Well, most guys who are named after a candy aren't too tough. You think you'll be safe there? Yeah, sure. Okay. I've got some unfinished business with the Reverend Martin, so when I talk to him, I'll press your case. Would you? You can bank on it. Now where's M&M's office? I'll drop you there. Wait till I tell Tori Spelling I've got my own bodyguard. (BOTH LAUGHING) Get the car washed. I hate it when I see dust on the hood. We've got to be at the studio in an hour. I'm gonna steam and mudpack. Tell Morton I may need a trim before air. I'll use his stylist. Right, boss. Uh, boss? (LAUGHS) Doesn't seem right any more. Can we go with, Your Holiness, Your Worship? (CHUCKLES) Don't push it, Angel. I remember when you were running errands in stir for cigarettes. (GASPS) Me, too. Hey, hey! Just like old times, huh, Angel? Swapping lies with the big stripes on the main line. Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Ain't this a bummer? I mean, His Holiness stuck here all alone, while the Angels of the Lord are at the car wash? Jimmy, if this is about that jacket that Rocky gave you, I'll give it back to you, I don't need it any more. It used to be just about the coat but the list is growing. This afternoon, we added a paint job on my car, new seats and windows. Your protesters trashed my ride. The Lord moves in mysterious ways, His wonders to perform. Blessed are the sheep of the Lord. But they know not what they... VI fix it. Good. Now, let's go get my sport jacket, huh? Where is it? In the main closet. Up. There's this young girl, Laura Sue Dean, she's in Little Ezekiel. She's being threatened because of this boycott you're orchestrating. There are fanatics threatening her life. Well, Jimmy, there've been fanatics threatening my life since I was eight. Occasionally, you were one of them. I still am. (EXCLAIMS) ROCKFORD: I don't believe this. Now, this girl, she's about 20 years old. She's a little obsessive, but underneath I think she's an okay kid. I want you to call your vigilantes off of her. Jimmy, the Lord helps those who help themselves. I mean, this child must cleanse her own spirit. If she's threatened again, I'm gonna come over here and cleanse your spirit with a can of mace. Okay. I'll work on that. Good. Oh, nice! Oh, well, now here it is. (LAUGHS) Yeah, right next to my old leather jacket! How did these get here? Oh, good question! There's a whole Rockford section in here. You can keep this. (SIGHS) Ah, well... I guess I've been making a lot of offerings, huh? Yeah. I'll probably be in the diamond lane to heaven, wouldn't you think, huh? (LAUGHS) Well, what else you got? Who does all this belong to? Just people. Besides me! (CHUCKLES) Angel, you and I have had a long and difficult history together. But held together for reasons that baffle all my other friends. You steal from me, you lie and cheat. Your ethics would embarrass a get-down robber. Yet, here you are, living like the Archduke Ferdinand. Better. What? (CHUCKLES) Better than the Archduke. I'm up there with Elizabeth Taylor and Travis Tritt. Yeah. But what's this scam? How did you get to be the head of a church? I mean, what's going on? What is your angle? Jimmy, you're not gonna believe this, but I had an epiphany. I woke up one morning and I just saw things through different eyes. And I came down to the church, wandered in a sinner, and then when the Reverend Thomas Starr asked for sinners to tell their story, I came up and I was bathed in the light of the Almighty, and I felt such rapture and I told my story. I actually spoke in ancient tongues. Reverend Starr said he never heard Aramaic spoken in such a beautiful accent. Aramaic? It's an ancient language. There's no books to translate it. You have to, sort of, like, feel it. (LAUGHS) You actually got away with that? They made me a deacon. (LAUGHS) So, when Reverend Starr had his stroke last month, I took over the pulpit and the rest is... Aramaic. Jimmy, I know you have a bad knee, and I know it's been bothering you for years. I could coax the devil spirit out of it, if you'd let me leave this bathroom. What's your hurry? How about I make you a deacon of the temple? As a deacon, you get to sit upfront on Sunday, go to the Palm Springs retreat, carry a church AMX card. You get special parking, and use of the choir on your birthday. I said, what's your hurry? I have to do Morton Downey Jr. in less than an hour. See, I'm doing a point, counter-point with the people that made the film and I'm running late. Angel, let me ask you something. What are you gonna do when you actually get up there and you have to account for all this, huh? I'll, uh, think of something. Angel, I wanna talk to the people that made this movie. I'm worried about Laura Sue. Maybe I can get them to hire some protection for her. So I'm gonna go down with you and see if I can set it up. No, no, no, no. He has seen the ways and will live in our holy countenance. So there. Jimmy, listen, since the Angels of the Lord are here, I got to take back the deaconship. Well, you didn't really earn it. I mean, normally, I get 10 grand for one of those. Have you or haven't you? I mean, it's a simple question? Seen the movie? That's the question, my friend. People doubt that you've seen the movie. They say you're boycotting it before you even know what you're boycotting. MAN: You don't have to see it... It's about a little boy who blasphemes the scriptures with bowling balls and pool water. (LAUGHS) What's more to know? That is not true! My friend, I tell you. We come to this country to make a beautiful movie. People cry when they see. They tell me, "Mr. Decosta, it's very nice movie." We open film tomorrow. These people say we insult the Bible, that is not so. We do not insult. We are not insulting! We are entertaining! My life has been threatened by a lot of the people in the audience. Show me. Show me who did it. Point them out to me. Point the people out! That one, there. And that one. Is this true, sir? Have you threatened this young lady? Yeah, we threatened the little slut. She was spreading her satanic values on our children. DANNY: Morton! Over here! I put my money into this movie and I'm proud of it. I'm proud to be the producer. And these people are inhibiting my ability to make a profit. They're picketing theaters, they're threatening violence, to keep the public away. MAN: Yeah. He's right! My rights are being undercut and I resent it. Okay! Danny Barkley, everybody. All right. Your dad owns Barkley's department stores, correct? Yeah. Now, why do these people have the right, in a free society, to interfere with free enterprise? Good question. Is this a first amendment issue? (AUDIENCE JEERING) First amendment? These men are idolaters. They must be stopped! They are poisoning our society with godlessness. They're corrupting our children... You better find a blunt instrument, this is about to go up the spout. I look to my Lord for my guidance. But there are those in the flock who can see into the future. I would like to present... Hey! I'm in your way, right? ANGEL: May I present, the East Indian mystic, Sarah Lanka. I see fires, I see devastation. I see the destruction of cities. She sees nothing! WOMAN: Right. She's false! This is nuts. No one can see into the future! You can't and these silk-suit immigrant gangsters can't. But Sister Lanka can! She sees truth. Hit it. ALL: (SINGING) Angel, Angel Special Angel Yes, I am your special angel. This was supposed to be a forum. He's making it into a circus. ANGEL: Sent from heaven above... MORTON: Reverend! Reverend! Martin! Reverend. Sit down, Reverend Martin! ANGEL: ...summer sunshine. MORTON: Would everyone please sit down! And what about touch? You want touch, huh? You feel my touch! Dan! Please, sit down! ANGEL: Warm embrace, and I'm in heaven again. Yes, I'm your special angel. (GASPS) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Calm down, sonny. I said calm down! Ain't this fun, Jimmy? (GASPS) Tell Deacon Verboomen that the E. Angel Martin fountain has to be in front of the E. Angel Martin Library. The bible studies center can go anywhere. If you're gonna be part of the congregation, Jimmy, try and get out of the events on time. Lordy, I'm glad I got rid of that jacket, that blood is never gonna come out. Last note. Tell the architect that the Angel Martin Stadium has got to have a statue of me in the east turnstile. I don't care if we're over budget. Tell them to rip off the one in Washington of Abe, sitting in the big square chair, and get the drawings to me promptly. And one last note of warning, Sid, though it is a long, torturous trail up the holy mountain to deacon, it's just a short cab ride back to choir master. Don't disappoint me, buddy. The Angel Martin Stadium? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Temple of Holy Light University. THLU. I'm kind of worried about that name. I don't want people saying, "Tender love hey you," or "Tough love hey you." Angel of Holy Light University, that's got a ring. AHLU? BYU? SMU? Brigham Young is a Mormon university. We'll work around that. Oh, yeah, right. I'm... I think I'll skip the ride home, Angel. I'll call a cab. I don't think my medical insurance can take much more of your church. Jimmy... Jimmy... Thanks for pulling that little dust bunny off of me. But I sure was cooking in there, wasn't 1? Oh, yeah. I love a fist fight with a good downbeat. (ANGEL LAUGHS) (CAR HONKING) (LAURA SUE WHOOPING) That was so bitchin' in there. I mean, you risked your life to save me. I'm gonna give your name to Shannen Doherty. Laura Sue, this thing is out of control. You need to get some professional security. I'm just an investigator. Those guys with the tattoos and the funny looking hairdos, they're not fooling around. You need to take them seriously. It's so gnarly. I Z opens tonight, so it's only gonna get worse. LZ is Little Zeke? That's so cool you got that. Hey, I didn't get a chance to talk to Branka and Milovan about security. Did you? No, I was gonna do it at the party tonight. You know what? You should be going with me. Make sure none of those cheeseburgers are laying in wait at The Phoenix room. I can't stop my head from bleeding. My coat's a mess. No. That corny gray jacket with blood stains is gonna rave at The Phoenix. (SIGHS) All right, Laura Sue, I'll go with you. Because somebody has to talk your producers into protecting you. You're blundering around in a mine field wearing snowshoes. You really have to try and focus on the problem. People are trying to kill you. Being open and uncomplicated is my best quality. Yeah. WOMAN 1: Come on, Stevie, let me in! WOMAN 2: Hey. MAN: Hey, we've been waiting an hour already! Mr. Decosta. Good to see you. Hi, Stevie. Come on in. Hi. MILOVAN: Hello, Stevie! Good evening, Mr. D'Sant. All right. Go on in. Hi, Stevie! Laura, how are you? Good to see you. Sorry, bub, this place ain't for you. What if I jump in a vat of Crisco? Is that supposed to be a joke? And here's the punch line. DEA. Let me see that roach behind your ear. It's just a cigarette. You got a drug record, Stevie? If I run you, am I gonna find a stack of 22.7's? Hey, Tony, how's it going? Hey, how you doing? (TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) Hey, where the hell did you go? Stevie at the door didn't think my jacket raved. Let's do this now so I can go home and tape up my head. I don't think my reputation can take much of this. Hey, wait a minute! DEA. Are we gonna have to discuss your future? No! What is this? I've never seen a badge like this before. Is this real? I made it myself, model air plane decals and a library card. ...14 fighter into Israel. So I'm coming in real low, like that. The Arab gunship spot me just like that. I do not see it hiding. And I'm coming low, right past... Excuse me. And he, hovering like this, fires two Foxbats. (IMITATING GUNFIRE) (ALL LAUGHING) (IMITATING GUNFIRE) Excuse me... Branka was a pilot for the Israeli Air Force. He helped bring US fighter bombers into Israel. Mr. Decosta, my name is Jim Rockford, I'm a private investigator. I believe that Laura Sue's life is in danger. I can't work for her any longer, but I think it's important that you provide her with some protection. This is silly. I know danger. We do not need defense. If she wants defense, it's okay, you be defense. But Acropolis will not pay. (MILOVAN LAUGHS) Anyway, here I am... (IMITATING GUNFIRE) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) MAN 1: Everybody okay? Anybody hurt? MAN 2: I can't tell. Your limo just got blown to hell! Somebody blew up our limo? The defense rests. ROCKFORD: What do you mean you can't go over there? I can't go over there! I'm supposed to just walk in there without a warrant and rifle through church records looking for someone with a record as a bomber? Hell, yes, this is Angel we're talking about. This is the Reverend Martin we're talking about. Oh, Dennis, this bombing, these attempted murders, they're all tied in with the silly movie boycott of his. You go over there, you grab him by his scrawny little neck, just like always, and you tell him you're gonna launch him into space if he doesn't cooperate. I'm not gonna do it. I'll try and get a warrant, but I'm gonna cross the T's, dot the I's, 'cause Angel has influence now. I don't believe you're wussing out on me. I'm obeying the law and recognizing Angel's rights. You're wussing, Dennis. Angel isn't gonna file a lawsuit. His nose bleeds in court. You're just mad because he made something of himself, became a man of the cloth. Heals people on television, gives them communion and everything. Man of the cloth? Communion? Have you been down there? It's strictly cheesecloth and grape juice. The only healing you're gonna see is from Dobermans. I'm not gonna do it. You know, you should get your head sewn up. Oh. It's still bleeding. You don't like this little leak? A lot of people think it raves. MAN: Back behind the line. We're gonna have emergency vehicles coming out. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. God, this is so depressing. Yes, it is and you know, we don't even have a clue who's doing it. Huh? What are you talking about? You said it was terrible. And I said it is. I was talking about how bummed I am I can't leave. I was gonna sneak into the late show and see Little Ezekiel with an audience. You know, sit with the straights in the back of the theater. That's when you can tell whether the film really works. Laura Sue, I want you to go to a friend's house. Stay there and don't tell anyone where you are. Dial this number and leave a message on my machine where I can reach you. Isn't the bodyguard supposed to stay with the client? I haven't been a bodyguard very long so I'm not sure of all the rules. For now, let's just do this. (BARKING) Whoa. What have you got there? (GROWLING) Hey, come on. Let's go. So predictable. Be finished in a minute, Zack. You're finished now, Rockford. ZACK: Come on! On your feet! Holy! Holy! Holy! God spake unto me, "You are my special angel!" (DOOR OPENING) Help guide my flock! Guide them and help them see! This ministry and our world outreach programs reach... (TV VOLUME DECREASES) Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. I'm so disappointed. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. My rod and my staff, they comfort me. Well, don't forget these chrome-plated .38s. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes! WOMAN ON INTERCOM: There's a message that Kenny Katz from Empress Films called. Kenny Katz? Oh, I know what that's about. Tell him I'll call him back. Hold my calls. Jimmy, you can't just break into the temple. It's the Lord's house. Well, I'm sorry, it looks like a half-way house. I got confused. Um, man, I'd love to put in a go-cart track somewhere. I wonder if a bible study center is really all that important. In a bible college? No. Trash it. Yeah. I guess eventually it's got to go somewhere. Angel, do we really need the Angels of the Lord? I need to talk to you. It's important. In all the years I've known you, I have never hurt you. Angels of the Lord may withdraw. You get frisky, Rockford, you're gonna join the Hallelujah chorus. (SIGHS) What do you pay that moron? He's a deacon. He gets all the privileges. He'll go screw up the Palm Springs retreat. ANGEL: No, no, no, no. I'm putting the E. Angel Martin Architectural Garden here. Angel, this boycott, somebody is gonna get hurt. I think one of your flock just blew up a limo that belongs to Acropolis Pictures. Well, I didn't do it. I'm a man of the cloth. I got sextons and deacons to alibi me. I didn't say you did it. I'm just telling you that some of the people in your church are a little over-committed. Nice way to put it. I mean, you say the picture is blasphemy and they go out and blow things up. You're gonna have to cool your jets for a while. I can't. I mean, I'm on a schedule here. This kind of thing runs on a schedule that is tight. Can you believe what's happened here? Well, that's what I'm saying. I mean, you're gonna have to slow them down. Oh, not that! Me! Okay, you wanna talk about tax audits, Jimmy? That's what started this whole deal. See, it was an IRS audit. I was trying to beat a tax rap. Ended up on TV with all of this. I mean, this country is the best! Being an ex-con, it doesn't hurt you. I love America. You and Don King. You know, I figured that if I could get into this church and become a sexton or minister or something like that, well, then, I could shelter my tax through the church's tax-free clause. And then I could tell these IRS clowns to just take a hike. So I come in one Sunday and look up on stage and all these people are doing the funky chicken and getting healed. I said, "Well, Angel, you can shake the dust off these stiffs." So I went up there, I told the story of my life. And because it was on TV, they got it all down. Well, it's in that You Are My Special Angel, word for word. I know, Chapter Four, with illustrations. And I got up on stage and I was jamming. (EXCLAIMS) And I started to choke. Really, Jimmy, I started choking. Maybe one of the words went down wrong. Guess what? It was perfect Aramaic. (LAUGHS) Can you believe it? It might've been, too. How do I know? I mean, it's a dead language. Listen, Angel, if you wanna keep this gig in play, you're gonna have to black-flag the cowboys in the congregation or you're gonna be up to your rod and staff in angry cops. Now, just give me the name of the biggest nut in your files and I'll work him. Chances are, if he's not involved, he knows the crazies who are, huh? Who's that gonna hurt? I don't know, Jimmy. Giving up a parishioner. Let me put it to you this way, give me the name, or I'll go to Becker and he'll write up a warrant and he'll come out here and open up this church like the can of corn it really is. Cat's name is Buddy Rennick. I was gonna kick him out of the church, anyway. He lives in a trailer in Palmdale. He says he talks to the Holy Ghost, but I think he's talking to the jackrabbits. Okay. There's just one more little favor. I want you to call this protest off. Uh, hey, I'm a little worried about Laura Sue. I can't seem to keep her headlights on. She's gonna crash. I'm giving up this boycott on the weekend, anyway. I mean, the schedule's killing me. You don't know how I've been... (CRACKING) Oh, why, hey, you're really great at this! I never would have thought about that. You know, redesigning the building. Now you can just lean it up against the gym. Name please? WOMAN: La sore. Okay. Go ahead. LITTLE ZEKE: But, Mommy, if you and Daddy still love each other, why can't we all live together, like before? Well, Little Zeke, I guess your daddy (MAN SNORING) has more important things in his life right now than you and me. LITTLE ZEKE: No, no. You wait, Mommy. Buffy and I will make a miracle. MOTHER: Come back here! Where are you going? Come back! I think I over-played that. Hmm? Hey! The director said, "Be angry." I never thought it was an angry moment. Little Zeke! Little Zeke! God, I suck in that scene. I should've played it softer. I thought you were just right. Very convincing. You did? Did you really like me? You're not just saying that? (DOG BARKING) Buffy, that's a wonderful idea! We'll get Daddy's bowling balls and we'll do it in the garage! (BRIDAL MARCH PLAYING) It must be God's will. Maybe you and Mommy can get married again. Oh, hello! Hi! Oh! Wait! There's my agent, Jerry Michaels. (EXCLAIMS) Jerry! Jer! He hated me. He despised it. You can tell, he doesn't even want to talk to me. Oh, he's probably just discussing the next picture. You think? Yeah. That could be it, I suppose, huh? Okay, Jim, be honest. Did you like it? Did you like me? Did I seem believable? Did I bore your pants off? Yes, yes, yes and no. Now, let's get something to eat. (CHUCKLES) I wonder where Danny Barkley is. Huh? (GIGGLES) I dated him a few times. He said he would meet me here. My darling! You are in the film, A Breath of Fresh Ozones. Air. (CHUCKLES) Air. Air is better, no? Much better. Did you like the way I played Camilla, Mr. Decosta? I kiss the feet of talent. But not here. We'll do the feet kissing some place private. I wonder where Danny Barkley is. Yes, it is strange. He usually likes these kind of things. Important agent and everything. But he's not here, so there is more champagne for the rest of us. (LAUGHING) Excuse me. Would you excuse us? Yes. (CHATTERING) Laura Sue, there is definitely something wrong here. I think Branka liked me in it. This film isn't blasphemous. There's, uh, no need to boycott this film. I mean, no disrespect, Laura, but it's... Well, it's, uh... You hated it. Well, hated, no... Hated is a very, very strong word. (STAMMERING) No, I was interested in a secondary capacity. What the hell does that mean? I was a little bored. Well, uh, not a lot. Just a little. It's not boring! And how can you say it's boring? Do you really think it's boring? Oh, God, it is boring, isn't it? I'm ruined. Wait, Laura Sue, you were magnificent! But the film, Laura, I mean, the whole enchilada seemed a little concocted. Hey, you wanted me to be honest. (SIGHS) Yeah. I mean, there's honest and there's nasty. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be nasty. It's just. Well, this whole thing is setting off a lot of my alarm buzzers. Yeah, what's another? Well, all right. There's this Danny Barkley. Where is he? I don't know. Well, you said you were dating him. Can you think of any reason why he wouldn't show up at a cast party? No. He put his money in because he wanted to be a part of this business. He bought 40% of this picture. He would definitely be here. Do you know where he lives? Mmm-hmm. You think you can show me? Mmm-hmm. That's his car. (DOORBELL RINGING) I know where the key is. Danny? Danny? It's Laura Sue. Danny? It's Laura Sue! Danny? Danny? Danny? Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, God! (LAURA SUE CRYING) He was a nice guy. Why, Jim? Why is this happening? I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. (CHATTERING) (SIGHS) Now, you see, Dennis? You didn't want to go stand Angel on his head. Look what happened to him. This whole thing is getting worse. And maybe if you didn't drive around town with the word "Satan" scribbled on the side of your car, things would be a little bit cooler down here. I didn't put that there and you know it. And if you want my list of suspects, just take a hard look at the two guys dripping gold and insincerity by the front door. Branka Decosta and Milovan D'Sant? They own a major movie company. They're worth millions. And talking about suspects, don't you leave town, 'cause I'm gonna wanna talk to you. What? Me? Oh, come on, Dennis! Didn't you lay this Barkley guy out yesterday on the Morton Downey Jr. Show? Oh, great. Vincent Penguinetti. That's all this case needs to qualify as an oil spill. Hey, Vincent! (CHUCKLES) Hi, Tony! How you doing? Good to see you. The chief thinks Vincent is the best private investigator in LA. Hey, Dennis! Boy, that Bosonovitch case was awesome! Way to go, babe. Chapman told me he's got his eye on you. Really? Yeah. You talked to Captain Chapman about me? Yeah, me and the chief and Chappy on the poker night. I did a whopper of a commercial for you, babe. Bread on the water, you know what I mean? (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) So, how's the repo business, Jim? It's honest work and it beats going through Loni Anderson's trash. (CHUCKLES) Well, somebody's got to work for deadbeats. Better you than me. By the way, Acropolis Pictures has hired me to organize their security for them. Now, that's gonna include all the actors on this picture, as well as Milovan and Branka and the rest of the executives. What're you trying to tell me? Pack it up. You're through. Milovan! Branka! BOTH: Hey! Penguinetti! VINCENT: Glad to see you. How's the wife? Jim, did you hear that? He told the chief the Bosonovitch case was awesome. You were getting a massage, Dennis! But Penguinetti's a showman with good PR. Do you think we can talk about Angel's church for a minute? The congregation down there, they're not winning any Mensa memberships. His flock couldn't get jobs scraping gum off of theater seats. What am I supposed to do with that? Well, I'd check them for records. Uh, the one guy, Zackary Irons, I did time with. He was a home invader or something. Also, there's this scripture-quoting weirdo out in Palmdale named Buddy Rennick. I pressured Angel into giving me his name last night. I went out there this morning and talked to him. My instinct is he's not a killer. Hey, you might wanna run a scratch and sniff test on him, though. Hey, Jim, don't go away mad, okay? That's awesome, babe. Awesome. (MAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) (SIGHS) I'm leaving. The guy who just pulled up in the Italian soup can, his name is Vincent Penguinetti. Famous private eye. Does cooking segments on Regis and Kathy Lee. He's your new security. Good luck. Nice knowing you, Laura Sue. Do I owe you anything? (CHUCKLES) No, I don't like to get paid when people end up dead. All I wanted was my sport coat back anyways. Think I'll just go home and go fishing. (GLASS SHATTERING) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) What are you doing? You're my bodyguard. No, I'm not. Hey, Rockford! That's my client! Yes, I am. Hey! Hey! Rockford! You know, I love the beach. I just don't get down here that often. I've got my skirt and my dress, my purse. And you've got my two bags. Yeah, I got them. Why'd you have to bring all this stuff? You're only going to be here a day or two. I need my things. (LAUGHS) I can't believe I'm in Malibu! And you live in a trailer? (SIGHS) Here you go. This is nice. It's not everything you were hoping for? Well, it's kind of small. Well, I'm kind of broke. God, this is so depressing. Come on, it's not that bad! No, I was thinking about Danny. Oh, yeah. I should've brought my Donna Karan with the lace collar for the funeral. I look dynamite in that dress. (SIGHS) Hey... He shouldn't be dead. All he wanted was for people to look up to him, like they did his dad. He was just a guy trying to live in a giant shadow. He was nice to me. He really liked me and he's gone now. I'll never see him again, Jim I'm okay. I just feel bad for him. LAURA SUE: What're you doing? Matthew 13:49. That was on the mirror in the bathroom. Yeah, here it is. "At the end of the world, the angels shall come forth, "and sever the wicked from among the just." Don't worry, I'm not gonna let you get severed. (LAUGHS) Good. WOMAN ON TV: Yes, I want you to give it to Susie. Forever. And give her a real ride for me... (LAURA SUE CRYING) For those are the things that... And the day you will die... ...the great events of life. Oh, Annie! Annie, darling. Laura Sue, it's 3:30. Are you okay? Yeah. This movie always gets to me. This girl runs away from her mother, 'cause she wants this glamorous life, and now her mother is dying and she doesn't even know it. It's so sad. WOMAN ON TV: She never believed... (TV TURNS OFF) Good night. Do you think you could talk to me for a while? (CHUCKLES) Sure, I guess. I know I'm a pain in the ass. And I wouldn't blame you if you took a cab on this whole deal. No, it's fine. I just don't usually have house guests. Especially movie star house guests. You think I'm a movie star? Oh, you're getting in brawls on Morton Downey Jr., then you're a movie star. But Little Ezekiel is a pretty awful movie, isn't it? Hey. Just getting in a movie in this town is a huge accomplishment. And you were good. You didn't stink. The movie did. You know, this movie, something's troubling me, maybe you can help. I'll try. Well, Danny Barkley bought 40% of this movie after the film had already been shot. That's a little unusual, isn't it? Well, we were over budget. The bank was gonna shut us down. So, we can assume that Milovan and Branka didn't want to put any more money in the film. They bring Danny Barkley in and he buys 40%, at a pretty steep discount, probably, don't you think? I guess. Mmm-hmm. So, Danny dies. Who gets his 40%? I don't know. I wonder if Acropolis Pictures had a buy-back clause. You know, sometimes in business deals, the surviving partners have a right to buy back the assets of the estate at a pre-negotiated rate. That's what's been keeping me up. (CLICKS TONGUE) That's neat, you really care what happened to Danny. What happens to me. Sometimes I can't figure out what I care about. I mean, sometimes, I think all I want in the world is to be famous. And then, sometimes, it seems like being famous isn't worth anything at all. So me and Stan, we just keep slogging on. Stan? Stanislavsky. I've wanted to be an actress since I was six. That's about when Stan and I hooked up. Stan used to be my manager when I was in grade school. Now I've got a guy at Durkin, Roskin and Kline who won't return my phone calls. Stan was a better manager. Weren't you, Stanley? Don't you have any friends? Not really. I mean, I have club friends. People I know who are never there for me. And I have actress friends. They're even worse. You've gotta compete with them for parts. (SCOFFS) And a few old boyfriends. But they're just prowling. No, it's just Stan. And you. Sometimes, Jim, I'm so frightened of what I'll become that I'm almost numb. And then, sometimes I'm so frightened of not becoming anything that I can't breathe. I mean, I want to be more than I am but I don't know how. Is that just nuts? (LAUGHS) That's not nuts. It's your best quality. (BOTH LAUGHING) Good night. Good night. Thanks for coming with me, Jim. Why do you think they want to see me? They're your agents, maybe they have another job for you. I've been with this talent agency for six months and they've never called me in for a meeting. Now they wanna meet on Saturday? Jerry Michaels hated the movie. I bet Branka wants to get out of the second picture. They don't like me, Jim! I'm ruined! I'll never work again! Whatever it is, you can't change it anyway. (SIGHS) You're right. If I come apart, Jim, get me out of there. Promise? Code three. Oh, Miss Dean. This way, please. (SIGHING) (DOOR CLOSING) Jarred, Jerry, Marty, Martin, Jer... (ALL CHEERING) To Laura Sue Dean, star of the '90s! What? Star of what, Mr. Michaels? Uh, call me Jer, honey, and don't be coy. Branka must've called with the weekend grosses. No, no. I was staying at Jim's. Little Ezekiel is through the roof! We're boffo in the cities! Socko in the burbs. Acropolis is estimating about 23 million as the first weekend take. WOMAN: That's right. That's fantastic! Isn't that great, Jim? And Jim would be what, our favourite uncle who really needs to get lost right now? Laura Sue is prime agency fruit. We don't need some middle-aged walk-on crowding the plate. When it comes to protecting our clients, you'll find that WACA can be pretty damned aggressive. I'm gonna let all that fly past, Jer, because obviously, you drink too much prune juice. (PEOPLE SNICKERING) Jim is my bodyguard. He's protecting my life from those threats. I've talked with PR. We think you should jump on TV and attack these right-wing extremists. Get right in their face. It's gonna be big news! Lots of coverage. We position you as the girl with the big cojones and go after the next Schwarzenegger movie. Excuse me, Jerry, but as Laura Sue's security consultant, I'd advise against that. These guys are pretty scary. Maybe to you, Jim, but not to me. And I know a little about fear. Believe me. I've been to fear city. I've seen mad elephant. Yeah, we're talking about people who've already killed one of the film's investors. JERRY: Like I said... Laura Sue is a very valuable fruit. We're not going to risk getting her hurt. And this is in her best career interests. Are you gonna stand between her and a bullet, Mr. Michaels? If that's what it takes, you bet. I'm not just some guy in Gucci loafers, Jim. I was in Grenada. I've seen combat. (EXCLAIMS) Grenada. Yeah, lot of ripe fruit flew in that one. Go ahead, make fun of it. But those Grenadine defense forces were crack units, and we looked down the business end of those Cuban AK-47's and we didn't blink, mister. Just like we're not gonna blink now. Weren't you a cook, Jer? (PEOPLE SNICKERING) Cooks were at risk just like everybody else. Jerry, as tough as the Grenadine defense forces were, you're not going to scare these thugs off with a potato peeler. Now, I don't think we should inflame them. You're gonna risk Laura Sue's life for some television exposure? You don't rise if you don't risk! Stars aren't born, they're developed. Strike while you have the chance and remember, fear is just a four-letter word. (GUN FIRES) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Get down! (GRUNTS) Come here! (PEOPLE CLAMORING) MAN 1: You okay? MAN 2: Yeah, I'm okay. And you? Anybody hurt? Everybody out in the corridor and stay low. These walls are thin, they won't stop a bullet. Go! Go! Go! Go! Call 911. Come on out, Jer. Did you call 911? Are they coming? I don't hear sirens! You can come on out. The guy's gone. There's 10 feet of open terrain to the door. I'm not coming out till the cops clear the free fire zone across the street. Shoulder to shoulder, huh, Jer? What? I'm supposed to die for an actor? (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) I'm telling you very, very observant, Dennis. I'm very impressed. I was just looking around up there where you said, and there it was. Ladies and gentlemen! Everybody! Dennis Becker located the brass. Eyes like an eagle, this guy. Show 'em, Dennis. BECKER: No, I don't think... Come on. We can get print hits off these cases and make the whole investigation. You think? Damn fine police work. Come on, show 'em, show 'em. BECKER: You sure? Yeah. (CLINKING) (ALL CHEERING) All right. Knock it off, guys, huh? You ever decide to pull the pin, you've got a job in my shop. (CHATTERING) Can I get out of here, Dennis? The penguin said I'm a policeman's policeman. High praise from a penguin. You don't like him because he gets all the high profile cases in LA. I don't like him because I think he works for mobsters without any regard for the truth. And because he's more concerned with his image than he is with his clients, and because he gets all the high profile cases in LA. So, can I go now? I've signed my statement, Laura Sue's signed hers. I'm escorting Miss Dean back to her apartment. I have two female operatives assigned to her. Both martial artists. Well, I'm an okay artist myself. Mostly it's just finger painting, but sometimes I sculpt mountains out of my ice cream when it melts. And sometimes I make quivering cowards out of smart-mouth pukes like you. How soon can we arrange for you to try that? Jim, you can go. I'll call you if I need you. Laura Sue... You sure you wanna go with this guy? No, but Jerry wants me to go. I guess I gotta do what my agent says. Change agents, Laura Sue. Even for a cook, Jerry was under that table way too fast. I don't think he'll hang tough in a career crisis. (WHISPERS) I'll sneak away and call you. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Hold it. (CHATTERING) MARTY: Listen, I got out of there so fast, I forgot my date book. Could you pick it up for me on your way out? JAMISON: No, no, no. I'm out of there. I'm not gonna go back in that office building. I'm gonna get my secretary to go back and get my briefcase. MARTY: Then have her pick up my date book. I've still got a lot of calls to make. You know, we've still got the Kenny Katz problem. Katz is a problem client. In fact, the whole Empress Film Slate is weak. You know, I think we're in quicksand there. Yeah, you should see his new film. I reviewed it last week. It's a gobbler. It's gonna do no business. We could sure use a boycott on that one, couldn't we? Yeah, you got that right. (MARTY LAUGHING) That's what Angel's selling. So you wanna have your girl bring me my book? (CAR ENGINE STARTING) JAMISON: Yeah, sure, where are you? In the garage. Where? What? What? Surely! "You say to me, how can that be, Brother Martin?" AUDIENCE: Amen! For, if the son of God... Spake not to Abraham, then he spaketh to me. And then the question must surely follow, for whom the bell tolls? AUDIENCE: Amen! It tolls for me! For when you speak of this, and you will... MAN: Praise Jesus! Be kind. And then I heard the Holy Ghost saying, "Oh, Suzanna, don't you cry for me." And I didn't, I didn't... Because God helps those who help themselves. MAN: You tell 'em! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) And speaking of help, can we help the children? Can we help the children? AUDIENCE: Yes! Now, item 478 is one I feel a very special pride in. Offering 478 is the autographed E. Angel Martin ivory chopsticks with the words, "My special Angel" engraved in dragon-red ink on the tip. Item 478 is only $45 plus postage. Now, while you're getting out your checkbooks, the merciful Angels choir will sing a song about my adolescent years. AUDIENCE: Amen! CHOIR: (SINGING) Teen angel Angel, be mine Teen angel Angel of God (WHISPERING) Water! Where's my water? I'm dry. Angels of the Lord, you're supposed to have bottles of Perrier standing by at all times during important sermons. You haven't paid me or the guys in two weeks, Angel. When's a little bread coming our way? Thou speakest of such meager things. Of payment? Of pieces of silver? Thou desirest money while souls are starving for salvation... (GRUNTS) Exactly. In a scam, when you fail to pay the bodyguards, they leave you dead in the gutter. Remember how that works. Mmm-hmm. Let's go. You're paying. Come on, Angel. (GRUNTS) (CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING) (EXCLAIMS) ZACK: Let's go. Come on there! Hey! What are you doing? A little labor crisis, Your Worship? Jimmy, they're trying to kill me! What do you expect? We met them in prison. They're all murderers. (GRUNTING) Come on! Boy, that was one of my better sermons. I was really cooking in there! You'd better get a copyright attorney. I think I've heard some of that stuff before. I just can't be traveling around the city streets in my holy vestments. Drop me off at the manse. No! Forgive him, Father, for he knows not what he does. I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm going to separate you from a couple of teeth, unless you get me some answers. Okay, go ahead, ask ahead, I'm fully informed. You're selling film boycotts to movie producers that have sick films. Your boycotts create free publicity and interest at the box office, right? Is this multiple choice? Because I'd like to hear the other possible answers. (SIGHS) You get these religious fanatics riled up and they go and kill people. I control my flock. This is big, Jimmy. This is the next big growth industry in the religious arts, which has become a very troubled business. What's so tough about standing up on TV and hawking overpriced garbage? Brother Swaggart and Brother Baker hurt us bad. Prayer pledges are dwindling. I mean, a reverend has got to have some vision now! It's one thing to make a video of the service. I'm not knocking that, but this boycott thing could be huge! I'm thinking I could get a piece of the box office. Who killed Danny Barkley? I don't know, Jimmy. I swear to you, I don't know. But my boycott didn't kill him. You mad, Jimmy? Boiling. Get out. Bless you, my son. May the Lord smile down his holy countenance upon you. What's happening, little mama? Your Holiness, this is Laura Sue Dean. Your boycott almost got her killed. Miss Dean! Danish coffee? Sugarless cookies? Don't these immigrants have any glazed donuts? I'm not feeding you, Angel. We're tr yin' to find out what's going on. Why Danny Barkley died. If he was in on all this, why did he go nuts and start swinging in the Morton Downey Jr. Show? It's almost as if he didn't know the whole deal was rigged. It cut the show short by 15 minutes. That doesn't make sense. Angel? I guess just the Danish coffee and I'll try the sugarless cookies. Was Danny in on the boycott? Was he ever in any of the discussions between you and Branka and Milovan? No. To tell you the truth, the boycott was Biff Adams' idea. Who the hell is Biff Adams? He's head of marketing at Acropolis Pictures. He's the one that set up the meeting between me and Branka and Milovan. But Danny wasn't there? They didn't give diddly-squat about him. He was just a rich kid that bought in. When he put up the money a few months ago, they were delighted to have him in. (WHISPERS) I gotta go to the bathroom. You can just hold it, Angel. You're not gonna skate out the bathroom window on me this time. Even angels have to go to the bathroom occasionally. Read your bible, Jimmy. Let's try it this way, what if Acropolis Pictures figured they had a loser on their hands. They're going over budget. They don't want to throw good money after bad. So, they bring Danny Barkley in to get 'em off the hook. They sell Danny 40% of nothing. Then, they get Angel to create one of his phony boycotts, and suddenly, Danny's piece is worth millions. But they gave it away cheap. So these Euro-trash ex-gun dealers decide they're gonna fix it the old-fashioned way. They make Danny Barkley a victim of the boycott. So maybe the exploding limo and the gunshots at WACA were just Milovan and Branka trying to make it look good. (SIGHS) Angel, you and I are gonna break into the offices of Acropolis Pictures and see if we can get a look at Danny Barkley's deal. Break into Acropolis? Yeah. That's right. Jimmy, you know I've never been good at the black-bag stuff. I was always better at dividing the money. You're coming, Angel. I may need you to help me grovel if we get caught. Let's go. And if you dare bless one person on the way out of here, I will deck you. You better not take off if we get in trouble. I wouldn't leave you. Yeah, sure. No, she wouldn't. She already waded in on four rednecks while I was getting stomped. Yeah, sure, I'm gonna really believe that. Hello. Branka, it's Vince. (LAUGHS) You ought to thank your lucky stars you hired me. I'm watching your offices. And you just got a couple of visitors. Looks like they're trying to break in. Sure, I recognize them. It's Rockford and that reverend. The guy on TV. Angel Martin. Put it here, Jim. (CHUCKLING) You first, then you pull me on up. I'm not going first, you are. Why me? Because if I go first, you're gonna take off and leave me here. Now, up you go. Come on. I'm a different person now, Jimmy. I had an epiphany. I changed. Yeah, you're sleazier. Now, up you go. Come on. Come on. (GRUNTING) (SOFTLY) Look at this. All these movies. You know what I see here, Jimmy? Lost business opportunities. Thirty boycotts hanging on the wall. Makes me wanna cry. (EXCLAIMING) Get in here. Now, you sit down in that chair and stay or I'm gonna tie you to it! ANGEL: When'd you start wearing glasses? Are they still over there? Yeah. Okay, now, me and Milovan will take over. (EXCLAIMS) This gives me a little problem here. What's he saying? (SPEAKING HEBREW) That's right. You see, uh, I think you guys are gonna go in there and make a body count. Yeah, so? So it makes me an accessory before the fact in a double murder. That's a special circumstances beef. People break in our business. This is not murder. This is protecting property. (LAUGHING) In America, we call the cops. We let them handle it. But you just can't go in, guns a-blazing. It gives me a problem. 'Cause I know you're planning to light these two up. In any event, it's premeditated murder. So, how do you suggest we fix this problem? (SIGHS) Maybe the problem just goes away if you put me on your permanent payroll. I'll protect you instead of that bunch of corduroy suits you got working for you now. For how much? What's he saying? (SPEAKING HEBREW) How much? How about 100 grand a year? (ALL LAUGHING) It's way too high a price for a problem I can solve with two ounces of lead. (DRAWER CLANGING) (SIGHING) Oh, it's all here, Angel. The whole deal. He bought 40% of Little Zeke for five million dollars. Picture is gonna gross at least 50. That means he's gonna get 20 million for his five. Maybe more with the European grosses. So, Branka and Milovan killed him. This is the motive for the killing, all right. I'm relieved, you're relieved. Can we leave? Hey! Hey! There's a survivor clause in here, says, if anyone dies, the remaining partner can buy the interest back at fair market. I really gotta go to the bathroom. You know, they had to kill him before the weekend grosses came in, because when Danny Barkley died, there was no box office, therefore, no adjusted values. Five million buys them 20. ROCKFORD: Now... There's a memo in here that they have exercised the buy-back clause. It's dated June 7th and signed by Branka. The seven has one of those crosses through it. Just like the sevens in the threatening note that Laura Sue got. You know, I thought at the time that was strange. You don't see many guys in Mohawks making French sevens. I gotta go. To the bathroom? No, home. I'm feeling ill. I think I got a hold of a bad communion wafer. (SCREAMING) It is against the law to break in my building. You're guilty, so you'll have to die. You have a kind of sketchy concept of the American legal system. Angels see not, therefore, they witness not and need not perish. Verily, I say unto you... Shut up! Shut up or I kill you now. You make too much noise and confusion. Get in! Maybe if you offer him a deaconship. Oh, excuse me... Oh, my God! My God... My... Are you praying or pleading? Oh, my God! Go to 4616 Atkin Way. I think you also killed poor Vince Penguinetti. We're gonna take you to Penguinetti's boat. You will die there tragically. (WHISPERS) Jimmy... Jimmy, Jimmy. What, Angel? Jimmy... Do something. I don't wanna die. Get in line. Dear Lord, this is a real one. This is a legitimate prayer. This time I'm not sellin' nothing. This time I'm begging. (PANTING) Don't let them kill me. And if you have to take Jimmy, I'll understand because I know how hard it is to save us both. Amen. That was very moving. (WHIMPERS) That's his boat. Let's see now. You break in, we break the window and set off the alarm. Vince comes out with his gun... (IMITATES GUNFIRE) Couple of shots, everybody dies. I put the gun in your hands. You know, this may sound silly, but hear me out... Would you consider a deaconship? There are huge tax advantages. Never again do you have to pay the skinny guy in the red, white and blue hat. All of your income is tax free. Tell 'em about the Palm Springs retreat. You're both dead men right now. Please, say goodbye, it's time for you to die. Jimmy, do something! (SIGHS) Well, maybe I'll see you upstairs, but I doubt very much you're going to make it, Angel. (CAR TIRES SCREECHING) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) Come out! (GRUNTS) ANGEL: I'm hit! (GRUNTING) ANGEL: I'm hit! You all right? Yeah. (ANGEL GROANING) Angel's been hit, try to get him in the truck. My butt! My butt! Let me roll you over. No, don't roll me over! Don't roll me... Okay, okay. Hey, Rockford! Let's make a deal. Okay? There's money! Lots of it! From the movie. Negotiations are over! (SCREAMING) Hey! I can't swim! (COUGHING) You know what I think? You would've been way ahead taking the deaconship. You would have even got the choir on your birthday. (CHATTERING) But are you gonna be okay? He almost killed me, Jimmy. Divine penance. Oh, my God. You think the big boss was telling me something? You, Angel? No! Just because you've been raising money for starving children and putting it in your own pocket? Now, why on earth would that count against you? I'm through with that church. That's a good idea because when this boycott deal comes out, you're gonna go on the list with Brother Swaggart and Brother Baker. Maybe you ought to think about getting out of town before the fraud investigators get hold of you. They can have their silly church. I'm out of here. (WHISPERS) Jimmy, where should I hide? Lapland? See ya! (GROANING) It's really too bad about the penguin. I loved that guy. He could make you laugh, could make you cry. A private eye's private eye. Yeah. He was prime fruit. I wanna go home, Dennis. You've got the Barkley deal folder. It's the motive in his murder. You know, we have a little discrepancy in the story. Milovan and Branka said that you killed Penguinetti. I'm not saying I believe it, but that's what they're saying. And right now, it's their word against yours. They're alibiing each other on Barkley, too. You're forgetting that their word doesn't mean anything in this town except a litigation. Come here. ...and then Rockford, he's at the front door, then Mr. Penguinetti goes out... (IMITATES GUNSHOTS) Some shooting. And then, Mr. Penguinetti, he's dead. You're lying. I am not used to actors in my films talk to me in that way. You have one more picture. You be careful or you'll be working with a dolphin, next time. I wouldn't work for you again if I hadn't eaten in a year. These guys shot Penguinetti right in front of their own office. I saw it. You lie. You think I'm lying? Yes! I got the whole thing on film, bubba. Oh, you know, she has so many good qualities. Sometimes, it's just hard to know where to start. MAN: All clear here! I'm thinking, maybe I'm trying to impress the wrong people. What do you think? Well, you gotta make those decisions for yourself. You know, I don't like Jerry Michaels very much. He didn't care about me until the movie started to make money, and that's not right. Good point. I'm thinking maybe I need to worry more about being a good actress than being famous. I agree. Honey, me and Stan have something we want to tell you. Come here. What is it, Jim? I have to tell you that I think that you are a very special girl. Special in a way that's so rare that you only see it occasionally. If I had a daughter, I'd want her to be a lot like you. Because you have courage and honor and talent and you don't quit on your friends in a crisis. So, me and Stan, we talked it over and we want you to know how we feel. (LAUGHS) You are one in a million. (BOTH LAUGHING)
