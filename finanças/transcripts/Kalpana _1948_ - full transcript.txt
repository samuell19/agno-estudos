You Tube - Video Running Time 02:32:18 You Tube search name - Kalpana - 1948 So you think this story can't be made into a film? No! I've begun a film company to make profits. Write a story in which there's love and lovers. Yes, box office! Spare a thought for the country, for these children. These children are the future of the country, indeed, of humanity. Don't destroy them. At least listen to my story in its entirety. Ay, raddiwala! Tie the stakes well. It has to be ready soon. - Aree, Uma... - Coming. Don't you dare say anything. Go away from here! Worthless fellow! You spoilt the sari. I'll beat some sense into you today! Scoundrel! You'll act, will you? Go away. Go do some more theater. When I grow up, I'll definitely take part in theater. Let's see what uncle does then! - Witch! You tattled about me! - I didn't tell anyone anything. What do you mean you didn't tell on me? I'll beat you into pulp. I'll beat you to pulp! Let go of me! I'll make mincemeat of you! When I meet you again, I'll cut your nose off! - Where are you going? - What's it to you? To the town. Are you enrolling this child in school? Yes. You did well. He's a very accomplished boy. He's a hooligan. Oh, so this hooligan wants to study? Look, my friend, I've beaten that lot into submission. Let me take your leave now. I've a lot to do. Go sit there! Show me your homework! You grow mangoes as well in your orchard? Good, good! You! Show me your work! Scoundrel! Your handwriting is so bad. Go sit there. You, Roopchand, show me your work. Hey, is there anything inside your head today? Want to know more? - Beat him. - Let go! - Beat him. - Get lost! Get up. Let me see. Take this. - Is this the one? - That's him, sir. Quiet. Give them 10 rupees and send them away. Leave. This is Udayan's grandfather. There are many elderly people like him in our country. I feel despondent when I think that strange dreams don't come true I have to suppress my emotions. Don't feel despondent, my son. Great feats are achieved in the world by people who have such thoughts. It's futile to suppress your emotions. Do it harder. - Let it cook more. - All right. Sit straight. Udayan. Wash your hands immediately with the solution in the blue bottle. Diseases like those are contagious. Ah, yes! Now I see a glimpse of you in these pictures, But you need new experiences, my son. You should go to a big city and see life. Where should I go? You should go to Benaras. Your imagination will be stimulated there. I immediately left for Benaras. Ramesh is bringing some girls... but we need to find more boys and girls and do the show soon. - Okay, but... - Don't worry about the money. I'll make all the arrangements. Look, they've arrived. Hello, Udayan. - Hello, Noor. - Hello. Hello. Come in and sit. I've brought these girls. Their father is my friend and a professor at Allahabad University, There's one thing. He said they won't work for money. One more thing, Udayan, my uncle has come from Bombay. I told him about you and he wants to meet you. - Can you come tomorrow? - Sure. - You come too, Noor. - Of course. Who is it? Who is it? This is what happens when you misuse "Taal". What are you doing? It's not him. You've brought the wrong person. Get up. Now that you're here, let me show you something. This is "Taal", on whose beats the entire world revolves. They transmit life force to the universe. Noor, you've arrived! - Hello, Udayan. - Hello. The same girl. The same face. You're staring at her, as though you know each other. Ramesh! I told my brother not to make fun of me. Come. Uncle, this is my friend Udayan... and this is Noor Mohammed. - So you're Udayan. Hello. - Hello. Noor, come and sit. Please sit, Udayan. It's a pleasure to meet you both. My daughter, Uma. - She's naughty. - Naughty boy's sister. I agree. You are this naughty boy's sister... and so you're my little sister. I'll address you informally. You should address me informally, brother Noor. You only met each other a minute ago, and now you've become siblings. - Why not? - And he's silent. Ramesh said that you're a painter as well as a dancer. I love both of those arts. She has been learning dance since childhood. Really? That's so strange. Now he speaks. Get them some tea. I'll come too. Is that the same knife I gave you as a child? Yes. It's the same knife. When are you performing the show? As soon as possible. Father, it will be my first chance to dance on stage. Unfortunately I won't be able to attend the show. - Why not? - I've to go to Allahabad for work. Be patient, my heart Why are you getting restless? It is an unknown happiness and desire Be patient. You will achieve it Be patient, my heart Forgive me. Whenever I see Lord Shiva's processions... I forget myself, and I start singing. Why are you so restless? Has the flower of your heart blossomed? All the secrets of your heart... who has heard them? Who has heard them? Who opened the door of his heart... and gave you a place to stay? Be patient, my heart What could I teach you, Uma? You're fantastic. I love the dance you've choreographed. Do it again. Brother, the manager of Shakuntala Theater is here. I told you about him. - Is he from Malabar too? - No. - Hello. - Hello. So you're rehearsing. Very good. Can you all leave, please? Why did you ask them to leave? Let them continue. He's my good friend. He helped me with my show... and he's promised to help us at Shakuntala Theater. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - The entire city knows... - Let's talk about money. No, not now. It depends on the show. I'll make sure the theater is full. Then there will be lots of money. I agree. Let's set a date. It's all over. Uma, are you really going to Mumbai tonight? Yes, I have to. You're leaving. They're leaving too. I'll feel forlorn. I'll pray to God that someday I can help you in this work. These past few weeks passed like a dream All of you are leaving at the wrong time. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Write to us. - I will. Say hello to your father for me. Goodbye, Uma. What's the hurry? Leave everything as it is. We will do as we wish. - Get out of our way. - We don't have to listen to you. - Leave now! - What's going on? I advertised the show a lot. If it wasn't a success, what can I do? - He says we owe him 300 rupees. - Why? Look. I spent this much money on advertising... distribution, printing posters, renting curtains, renting chairs... Carriages and horses. All initial expenses. - Who knew you? - Show me the accounts. Who are you to look at my accounts? You're a liar and a cheat. Go to hell! I will crush you. Thief. So you want money! Let's get out of here! Police! Police! Police! - Quick! - Police! Both of you know what happened next. He feels guilty for murdering the manager. Don't ever leave him alone. Death is here as well. Death is all around. Who's there? A woman. I wander in darkness. Who are you? Do you think I'm crazy? I'm not crazy. My mother has just died. Death. Whenever you hear a scream, someone else has died. No, I won't let you go. I found a lone man alive in this hamlet of death. Where is Udayan? Brother Noor! Brother Noor! Noor. Noor. Brother Noor. You've come. You're the same man I met in the dark. A dead body is lying in my house, too. The nectar is falling. Collect it from the tall palms The pot at the top is overflowing We fill up big pots at home The pot at the top is overflowing The nectar is falling. Collect it from the tall palms Kamini, why are you sad? Come on, the dancing outside is wonderful. - You'll feel better. - I don't like rustic dancing. I don't like this village. These villagers are the life of our country. Have you decided about leaving tomorrow? How can I decide? You're busy with your friends. Tell me. Where will you go? Why not come to Bombay with me? The estate account. The Bombay company account. The bank account. The key to the safe. Very good. Let's talk about work, Udayan. - If we tour Allahabad, Benaras... - Not Benaras. Or Allahabad. Cross them both out. Calcutta Lucknow Delhi Karachi Lahore Agra Madras Bombay Wake up. You always sleep in this wonderful city. Which city? All the filth of Europe and America has been dumped here. What's shameful is that we are proud of our ignorance. I like Benaras. You're sleeping again. Wake up. Our dress rehearsal is today. Rehearsal? Of course, you'll get to meet Uma today. This is Uma and her father. This is Kamini. Udayan has told me a lot about you. This is my friend Sunder, and another friend. Start rehearsing. I'm coming. Once more. Once more. Once more. - I can't do it. - If they can do it, so can you. I'm tired. So now you know everything. But don't tell anyone. So you really... Please, understand me... my life is a living hell. Come on, get up. Watch us dance for five minutes. Go on rehearsing. Come on, it's getting late. We'll be right back. I toil for you, but it's all for nothing. You only think of Uma. I'll kick her out. No one can snatch you away from me. Listen, Kamini, you mind your tongue. Those poor girls and boys slog for me day and night... and you dare complain about them! Who walks on the banks of Yamuna with a slow gait? Dressed as a woman from low caste, she seems like a queen from heaven She's dressed in a yellow sari. She has covered herself She doesn't wear anklets. Whose wife is she? Who walks on the banks of Yamuna with a slow gait? Dressed as a woman from low caste, she seems like a queen from heaven Do come, Uncle. - Today is our last show. - I'll come. Uma, I didn't know you were also a good cook. - Goodbye, uncle. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Uma. - Goodbye. Uma. - What's happened? - Autograph please. Where were you? Do I always have to tell you where I go? - Uma's house. - Here, a letter from Uma. Why are you so quiet? You'll get sick working so hard, Udayan. Not sick, I'll go crazy. There's no need to get angry. I didn't say it to hurt you. How could you hurt me? Police, police. The police are everywhere. A death penalty would've been better than this. Are you drunk or have you really gone mad? I committed a murder! I'm not joking, Kamini. - When? - Before I met you. - Who was it? - The manager of Shakuntala Theater. - Shakuntala Theater! Who? - Shankarlal. Is it true? Now I understand... why you didn't put your name on the program. Hello. lnspector. My life is a living hell... So for you I am hell. Let's see how she extricates you from this hell. Send the police immediately. Today is the last show. Concentrate on your performance. Now go and rest. Turn on that spotlight. Over here. Towards me. Fine. Now that one. - Over here. - Come with me. - Where to? - I want to show you something. The police are outside Udayan's room! What are you doing? Be quiet. I'll make everything all right. Send him in. - Good evening, Ms. Kamini. - Please, have a seat. - I hope I'm not late. - You're right on time. I value time, because time is money. We spoke about money over the phone. I've brought it, Ms. Kamini. Not to praise myself... but believe me, Shankarlal has never cheated anyone. I have prospered so much because of my honesty. I've called some rich people tonight to collect money for your art. Miss, should I stop him? No need. Thank the inspector for me. After you get money at the party tonight... let these village boys and girls go. They don't understand you... or how much you've done for them. Uma, come here. Here's the money. You won't have any problems now. We all want to leave you. We discovered you don't need us. That money belongs to brother Noor. Donate it to a charity. Come on! Why are you taking so long? You go, Kamini. I don't want to meet them. But for you I... - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing? Master! I've been thinking about him. - It was a wonderful dance. - Yes, indeed. Did you hear, Mr. Naik... - whiskey is being legalised? - Really? Yes, it'll now be available for 30 Rupees. I've paid 125, even 150 Rupees for it on the black market. I wish men's blood could be sold like liquor. It would fetch at least as high a price. Have you read the news? There's going to be a severe drought. A drought. Our poor country. I pity us Indians. I used to faint when I'd read the news of drought in Bengal. My husband used to say... "Lily darling, don't read the newspaper. You have such a weak heart." I don't understand why Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Nehru.. Are taking so long to free our country. Because you don't pay their salary, madam. Hundreds of thousands are starving in India. What a pity. Don't pity them. Instead, let's drink to their death. - A toast. - To their death! There's nothing else we can do. Why not? You are all rich and wealthy. You could provide financial aid to the country and the arts. Good idea. It's the least we can do. Isn't it, sir? Not "sir". He's the King of Mills. Not a king. I'm a farmer, a helper of workers. A friend to the poor. This factory is my business. I want to transform the workers into iron muscles and wheels. I want to turn them into a machine. Move! Back to work! Will you lay down your life for a handful of rice? No. It's time. Have patience. It's not the right time. What's happened to him? All right. Listen, you don't have to operate the machine... you have to work like a machine. We have to work like a machine. We have to work like a machine. Machine... Machine... Machine... We are leaving our land and getting trapped... in a demon's snare. Beware! Don't let him brainwash you. We want money! We want money! Great! Money! Police! Money! Money! My rich and wealthy friends who have gathered here... I know that all of you love your country and its culture. - Of course. - Yes, certainly. Mr. Udayan wants to open a cultural center... but all of you will have to help him... at least for my sake. Sure, I would even lay down my life for you. Thank you. Mr. Udayan will now talk to you about the cultural center. I should talk to them? Liquor has dulled their senses. They only know how to exploit the poor. - And I should talk to them? - Udayan, you're drunk. You don't know what you're saying. I was very drunk. The trance of your fake culture made me lose my senses... but I have regained my senses. Stop, you're humiliating these decent people. Decent? Which of them is decent? Show me his face. He, who has stripped thousands of women bare... and spun clothes in his mill for rich women? Or the officer who loves to rape women? What? I don't have bad feelings towards them. They're living zombies, who even take bribes from the dead. These are the women of our society... who sell their honor for clothes and jewelry. Are they decent? - What are you doing? - Who's decent? Who can claim to have scruples? - Nonsense! - Wild man! - Why did you invite him? - What's he doing? - He's crazy! - Has he no shame? - We don't know him. - No money for the cultural center! I don't care! And you! Because of you I forgot humanity... and I hurt my friends' feelings. I became greedy for fake honor and esteem. Move. - Where are you going? - Where you... and your corrupt society can't reach me. Let go! My poor dear. - Poor thing. - Udayan! Udayan. Mr. Udayan. You want to promote culture... but how will you without money? Even if you went begging door-to-door... you wouldn't get more than 5 or 10 rupees. Here, you could've had thousands all at once. I respect you a lot. You can really do something in the world. I want to donate this money to your cultural center. May God grant you success! I have one request. Don't think that all rich people are bad. Rich people are also human. Sir! Sir! Here. 5 million rupees! From where did he come? He's so sweet. Forgive me. Udayan opened a cultural centre in the pristine Himalayas. Many students came to the cultural center to learn. Udayan set out on the biggest mission of his life. Experimental radio station. Library. Museum. Gymnasium. National theater. The cultural center had all kinds of equipment... to develop children's physical well being before they began school. The students of the cultural center would have open air lessons... without caring for storm, hail, or hot or cold weather. Cultural center radio. From now on there will be a new program every Sunday. Each student will participate in drama... music or dance, depending on their talent. We have been unconscious for so long Silent for so long We are dancing like puppets We have been unconscious for so long Everybody has donned a mask Everybody indulges in pretentious talk Dreams weaved in bygone centuries For so long we have been doing other people's bidding Dancing like puppets We are dancing like puppets We have been unconscious for so long We have been divided into cast and creed lnto culture and tradition We have been segregated into religion and family Living in the shadows of centuries past Dancing like puppets We are dancing like puppets We have been unconscious for so long We are dancing like puppets Come in, Kamini. Kamini, please sit. I'm delighted you've come. So Udayan lives here too? Actually, that photograph fell from the table and... - Uma, look who's arrived. - Brother Ramesh! All this time we were so happy. And now the wrath of Rudra. This way, Kamini. Kamini, we lead a strict, disciplined life. I understand, Udayan. I left my house and my wealth... society, everything for you and your work. I crave for your love. I hope you won't reject me. Their brain is not fully utilised. They can't hear. They can't see. They can't speak. Hail Peace A bomb has exploded! Run, save your lives! Drama class. Education today is destroying the strength of youth. Only the mind is stimulated. They're not taught about humanity I'll find you a rich girl to marry. My daughter will work in the civil service. Your mother was illiterate, but you've obtained a Masters. I'll find a civil service job for my daughter. I've spent thousands of rupees on you, son. I'll get much more in return. Did you hear, this boy has graduated? Well done, a Masters in Business Administration! Now I'll demand 50,000 rupees when you marry! We respect you... but this is our future. Our nation can't progress without education. Throw away those degrees. We're crushed by their burden. To hell with the prestige of our motherland. I don't want this degree. - What about after we're educated? - I don't want this education. I don't want this sort of education. So many of our nation's youth are deprived of good education. For the development of our country... we need not one, but several cultural centers. - Undoubtedly. - You are right. I remember a tune. Glory to India Glory to India Glory to awakened India This song is a pledge for our future. We will revere our golden past by singing this song every day. The world considered India as the holy place... of intellect, literature, culture and tradition. Today, India is broken into pieces. I am the mother of 400 million children. My children are sleeping soundly and dreaming of revolution... while I am being robbed. Mother India is being robbed. Bengali man, stay away from me. I'm from the country of not one or two, but countless great men. Ram, Krishna, Arjun, Bheem... Baba Akbar, Motilal, Jawaharlal, all born in my country. The Taj Mahal is our creation. Did you know that? Don't you push me. Do you know who I am? I'm a Bengali. Our Bengal has great people like Chandi Thakur... Bankim Chandra, Rabindranath, Jagdish Chandra, Subash Chandra. All of you are fools! Because of you, foreigners have seized our country. What are you saying, Bengali? We have great men like Chhatrapati Veer Shivaji Maharaj... the Queen of Jhansi Laxmi, Dnyaneshwar Tukaram... Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak. So what? You're nothing compared to the Punjabis. Look, the crops have started budding Get me married, Mother. My beloved has brought me slippers He went out to shop. What did he get? He bought an axe Make her wear the wedding bangles Apply kohl to her eyes She walks away with a smile She is loved by everyone Hear me out. I hold an important office in this village Be careful, my friend. Take that Come on, everyone Be careful, my friend. Take that Someone dodgy holds the office Be careful, my friend. Take that We have one of the oldest universities in the country. We feed the nation. We are proud of this. We have great people like Guru Nanak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Bhagat Singh. - What did you say about us? - Don't let them hear. Don't ruin their lives. Don't make them enemies of humanity. Mother lndia's little children... are crying on their hapless and fallen mother's lap. We have to show them the new light of life... which leads them to the golden path of love for all and equality. Vande Mataram. Our ancestors crowned Mother India. Great sages and saints were born in our country. Ram, Krishna and Buddha were our ancestors. Poets like Kalidas, Khushru, Tulsidas, Surdas, Kabir... Zou, Ghalib and Rabindranath were born in our country. The great Gandhi lives in our country. They only make speeches. They don't do anything themselves. - Gandhi. - Glory to him! - Mother India. - Glory to her! Stop singing glories. Don't insult your mother, who is plagued by conventions... infighting and orthodox views, with these glories. I always thought your glories would improve things for me... but instead they're always merely words. Mother India is afraid to enter your dark world of illiteracy and devastation. Before liberating your community, country and humanity... you have to liberate yourself from the shackles of stupidity. You are in a deep slumber, dreaming of revolution. In your dreams you are using your strength... to cut each other's throats. Caste discrimination is poisoning our society. The power of love and unity can save humanity. Set an example and let this power prevail and triumph. There is hope. Wake up! The world is rousing you. Unite, because you truly are united. Come, brave soldiers of the country The ones who have grown up on the waters of Ganga and Jamuna The cultured people of this country of Bengalis The religious ones of the Southern region Come, unite and forget your differences Make India heaven Hindustan The earth and the sky of one world All of us will surely unite Bathe in blood Endure your tears Safeguard customs and traditions We will make a new world We will create a new human We will liberate women Our dear mother of humanity We will liberate humanity We will liberate people Hindustan The earth and the sky of one world All of us will unite fearlessly May our respect be intact Glory to India Glory to awakened India You wanted to discuss the expenses, didn't you? We've spent 5 million rupees wisely... yet still our expenses are mounting. Where can we find money? If we tour the country performing, won't we earn money? I have a friend in Mumbai who owns a film studio. I can write to him if you want. If we made a film, we could earn a lot of money. A film? It's a good idea, Kamini. But in our country... films are doing more harm than good. I wouldn't like to work with the film industry. Anything but making a film! I didn't think my idea would be rebuffed like that. - If you don't make a film, then beg. - Why would we beg? If we're truly dedicated to our art, people will come and donate money. They'll never come. People won't spend money and time coming here. Why shouldn't they come? We'll organise a cultural festival. Spring is drawing near. We'll celebrate it, along with... The inauguration of our national theater. Exactly! - Brilliant! - Perfect! What a great idea! It's a wonderful idea. Why didn't you come to dinner, Kamini? What do you care? Who are you to ask me? I don't think you're well today. Go away. I don't feel well. I have some good news. We've decided to have a spring festival. We'll perform all different Indian dances. - It'll be great fun. - Really? Close the window. I feel cold. - Will you close it or not? - Air is good for you. I'm sleeping beside the window but I don't feel cold. How come you feel cold? If you want to quarrel, just be honest. - Don't use the window as an excuse. - Don't argue with me! - Let me go! - What are you doing? - This can't be tolerated! - You're right. Before criticising Kamini, we must first look at ourselves. We're taught about reforming bad habits... but we quickly forget these teachings... and start criticising each other. Who here is without vice? Is it better to complain about vices or to reform them? Come on, let's elope. Life is so stringent here, we can't live in peace. I hate this place. Promise me you won't tell anyone. You won't, will you? What about your love for Udayan... for which I endured everything until now... even your slaps? Please, Uma, promise you won't tell Udayan. Will I tell Udayan? Okay, I won't tell him. Now go. I can't believe it! - Send Uma, and Madan too. - (Muffled) Uma, is Kamini speaking the truth? Well? Why don't you answer me? What's this all about? When did you start seeing Madan? Madan and me? - Let it be, Udayan. - Uma! Uma! Madan, is Kamini speaking the truth? I was going to tell you personally. Don't you feel ashamed? - It's Kamini's fault too. - And Uma? Uma saw Kamini and me together. - You're having an affair with Uma! - With Uma? No! - Forgive me, Uma. - Don't say that. To stop these trivial matters from harming the principles of this place... it's better if I leave after the spring festival. Uma. Uma! Forgive me. I didn't know my little joke would become so serious. You call this a joke? Uma, we'll talk about this later. Finally, you'll have a chance to win Udayan's heart. Kamini! Kamini. Kamini! Forgive me. It keeps flowing It's been flowing for so long The tumultuous current of life It keeps saying It keeps saying My capricious heart is swaying Waves rise and fall every moment The sad plight of my heart It keeps saying Rise It keeps flowing The banks that never meet depict the motion of life It flows and faces the obstacles in its way It keeps enduring Rise It keeps flowing Don't be sad, Uma. You know? You've become an integral part of my life. When I think of work, I first think of you. Now I understand. Come, let's go to the temple. - Have you seen Udayan anywhere? - No. I feel as though I've always known you. What's so surprising about that? Maybe you have. Remember this? When I was young, a girl... So, you're the black witch that stoned me! See! That's why I never told you. I knew you'd want revenge. Naughty girl. Why didn't you tell me before? - I was afraid to. - Come on, let's tell everyone. Wake up I adore your dusky complexion My handsome Lord I get up early in the morning and look at you All the milkmaids make fun of me I keep an eye on your door just to get a glimpse of you Wake up, Nand Kishore Lord, bless Udayan. May he be successful. Come in. Uma, what is this? Today is an auspicious day. Uma, whenever I see you, I remember my childhood. Do you even remember when you were beaten for your mischief? So you remember that too? Of course, such sweet memories. Who knew that vagabond boy would become the pride of our country? Uma, you love this work immensely. Will you really leave it all? I'm sorry, you can't enter. - I've got a ticket. - You're not wearing Indian attire. - Is this a joke? - It's you who are joking! We're celebrating our nation, and you've worn modern clothes. Ticket. Please follow the yellow line to the National Theater. Why did they get in? They're wearing their national dress. Don't be angry. You should match your attire to your face. This is a foreign shirt. It's made in Europe, not India. Put on some Indian clothes. This way. This is the cultural center. Brothers, today people from all over the world... have gathered to celebrate the spring festival. For the first time ever in India... Never seen before... Nothing like this has ever happened... in the whole of India. A wonderful cultural program... Awards for bravery... We should all be proud to have a cultural center. Uma! You are so exuberant. You're playing the part of Radha! Who'll be Parvati? Madan, what's this? Emotional graph. - Emotional graph? - Yes, an emotional graph. Our Kings' emotions will be displayed here. Quiet. Don't laugh. PLEASE REMOVE YOUR SHOES - ls anybody there? Where's the door? - There. Is this a door or a mousehole? You enter from here. Kings as well as paupers must bow their heads. - This is an insult. Go inside. - Go inside. - After you. - After you. A program pamphlet? Come on. Today, our country is on the brink of freedom. In these circumstances our nation's leaders... will understand the importance of a national theater. They will join hands with artists... and establish national theaters throughout the country... which will safeguard our country's culture and tradition. This national theater is being inaugurated by Lord Shiva. A warm welcome to you all on behalf of the cultural center. Salutations, O Lord Shiva! O consort of Gauri! Folding our hands in devotion... we pray to you, O Lord Take away our fears... and bless us O Lord Shiva, consort of Gauri! You're trying to be Parvati. Hurry up, Udayan, everybody's waiting for you. Ramesh, tell Manipuri's teacher to begin without me. Sit here. Uma, please leave. I want to talk to Kamini. Come quickly! Lalita has fainted. Go away, you poor unfortunate! It's not poverty that's unfortunate, but the fake splendor of the rich. It compels them to beg and eat their leftovers. Your jealousy is what's unfortunate. You can't stand Udayan's love for this child. - Uma! - Keep quiet. You think you truly love Udayan... and that I've snatched his love from you... but you don't have to snatch what belongs to you, Kamini. I've known Udayan since childhood, and I love him. I will love him all my life. Nobody can stop me. Your love is fatal. It's fake, deceiving. You wanted to kill me? You didn't think I could stab you with your own dagger? Evil coward... I wouldn't soil my hands with your blood. Go away. There's no place for wicked women like you... in Udayan's holy cultural center. - Go! - Uma! No! I am not mean and cruel like you. I don't want to usurp you and rule this place. My love knows sacrifice. Udayan's love is shielding me from the adversities of the world. I have been nurturing this love dearly. It grew gradually and encompassed my entire life. Even so, Udayan will never know of my love. After finishing my work here... I'll leave this place cherishing my love in my heart. I'll go far away where the world is less filthy. Manipuri is about to begin. Get ready quickly. Manipuri is about to begin. Get ready quickly.

This is our life, our future. Light the lamp. Come Dreams light up life It's the sky of lamps Light the lamp Dusk brings darkness with it It precedes tomorrow's dawn Gather the lamps of hope Bring a new era to the world Light the lamp Cover it with your veil Save it from the storm A hundred lamps with similar flames Use the lamps to light the way Light the lamp We are the future of India We are the people We are the future of India We are the people We are the fruits of labor We are the tomorrow of all tomorrows We are the future of India Observe closely the faces of these farmers. Maybe they are asking who can truly venerate the plough? You? No. Us farmers, the plough gave us life. For centuries it has fed a great many millions. We worship the plough, but we must also see the present. Famine is plaguing our country. We depend on other countries for grain. We have to march with time. There's no shortage of fertile land in our country. There's only a shortage of equipment. We have to meet the demands of the world. Hail the supreme Lord The Lord is the keeper of the poor He is the friend of the poor people You purify all the sinners. You are the supreme Lord You show pity to one and all. You are the friend of the poor The Lord is the keeper of the poor Discard fear lnstead of rising, our Kings' excitement is dropping. Look who's coming! Don't shoot, my enemy My mother-in-law doesn't take it well Don't shoot, my enemy Stop the boys' dance and start the girls' dance. The milkmaids like Kanha's armlet The anklets are taunting me, even when I walk two steps The milkmaids like Kanha's armlet Look at what's happening there. Bliss. Bliss. Bliss Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to say something... especially to those women who live behind the veil... and have long been oppressed by men. As long as women are enslaved by men... humanity will also remained enslaved. Our experiences at the cultural center have taught us... that our fellow countrywomen... are no less talented or intelligent than men. Until our countrywomen are free... we can't be truly free. Will the next generation of women be so shameless? You weren't shameless, but that didn't get us far. Marvellous! I'm in ecstasy. I feel like splurging all my wealth on these beauties. - Secretary? - Yes, sir. How many girls are dancing? I think around 30 girls, sir. Donate 3 million rupees to the cultural center... and tell them to get these 30 girls to dance. Yes, sir. 3 million rupees for 30 girls! My ancestors used to spend that much on a single girl. Manager. Donate 3 times as much as he did. - This is quite dangerous! - Indeed. Gentlemen, please sit down. Rajendra Singh is amazed. - 5 hundred thousand! - 1 million rupees. - 2 million. - A million and a half. Two and a half million. - 3 million rupees. - 6 million! - 4 million. - 7 million rupees! - 10 million rupees! - 12 million rupees. 16 million rupees! to the museum. Mr. Udayan, why didn't you announce His Highness's name? I'll announce it again. His Highness... 1 million rupees to the museum. Udayan, why didn't you announce His Highness's name? - Again? - We didn't hear it. His Highness Rajendra Singh has donated... 1 million rupees to the cultural center's museum. I am a Communist. I don't want people to hear the names of filthy rich kings. I won't tolerate it. You can do my job. I shall dance. Who are you? A man. Who are you? Nature. Culture. Envy. Youth. Mourning. Old age. Duty. Universe. Corruption. Boycott. My daughter... I don't care for society, but we must be reserved. Do whatever you want. Society. Society! It believes in age-old shackles of righteousness... and yet breaks them. The pride of society is that it doesn't believe in what it does... and it doesn't do what it believes in. Society is the ultimate authority. It breaks God's laws and creates its own. If you love her, prove it in front of them. Carry her up to the top of the steps. If you fail, your name will be blackened. You may die trying. If you succeed, you will marry her. Marry her. Come on, begin. Go on, go on! Stop! Get back! Get back! Go on! Go on! So, you've finally killed Udayan. You met him in your dreams. I met him in the storm. Until now, only my world was ruined. Now your world is ruined too. Kamini! What are you looking at? It's the same Udayan, but now he's lifeless. Come, we can go wherever we want. Uma! No! No! Without you, my life is useless. All my dreams will remain unfulfilled. You! People revere you as God. They pray to you day and night for protection. You are the God of destruction. Are you not content after wreaking havoc all over the world? Don't worry. You can return to the festival. You fool. You're sensible, yet you worry about a trivial matter. Be strong. Everything will be fine. Uma, you take care of him. We want to see how the show's going. Don't worry, Udayan isn't hurt! Soon he'll be dancing! Uma, why are you crying? Don't get up. Lie down. Uma, will you be mine? Tell me. Uma, tell me, will you marry me? Why don't you answer me? Udayan, can you come? Everything has come to a standstill because of you. You come too, Uma. Hurrah! Hurrah! His Highness asks if this is an African dance? Yes, it is ours. His Highness asks if this is an African dance? I'll make an announcement. This beautiful dance comes from the people... of the Naga hills on the border of Assam and Burma. Hollywood often portrays India as Africa. Those who thought that this was an African dance... have just given ample proof of their ignorance. It is every parent's duty to let their children... travel the world and widen their knowledge. The greatest onus lies on schools, colleges and universities. 2,005 rupees. 5 and a half rupees. - Only 5 rupees. - Only 5 rupees? - Hey, only 8 rupees. - 8 rupees? Uma, go and see. There's a shower of wealth. - 5 rupees. 7. - 5. 7.7 and a half. 6 and a half. 5.4. - 5. - 8. - Uma's words have come true. - Yes. Friend, I asked you. Friend, I asked you Friend, the drums are playing, I asked you Friend, the cymbals are playing, I asked you Friend, wake up the earth, I asked you Friend, I asked you. Friend, I asked you No, it's not possible. I can't bear it. Will you be mine, Uma? Will you be mine, Uma? It's a success! God, what's happened? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you be mine? So much money! Will you marry me? There's so much money here. Everyone will get some. Everyone. Run! If you have the courage, come and fight. - I want money. - Money. You will get money. Everyone will get money. Please, hear the entire story! Here's your story! Guard, throw him out! Get him away from here! Father, hear the rest of the story. No love! No romance! No lovers! If I made that movie, I'd become a pauper! Someday soon we will be released from your clutches. You have harmed the country with your selfishness and dishonesty. You will have to pay the price very soon! Don't get angry. If you're so brave why don't you spend 2 million rupees... setting up a studio? Then you can make your film. You won't have to come here begging. Out! It's where you belong. Beneath this light, I am standing in darkness. This bazaar of joy and happiness... is drowning out the voice of my soul. My country is drowning. The world is drowning. Humanity can't find a way. God, will this country remain enslaved? Will its people never gain sense? Will they just quietly watch the devastation? For how long will my country sleep? For how long will my dream remain just a dream?
