Oh, yeah? What do you know about women's bodies? Not enough. You're not worried, are you? No. Just thinking. What? What? What? Uh... Maybe we should go back. - We're halfway to San Diego. - I know. I know. I just... It's just been hard to know for sure. Dad must think I'm an idiot. Look, Beck, I know it's not in your nature to put yourself first, but in this case, I don't think you should take Mom and Dad's feelings into account. I don't think you should take my feelings into account. I don't think you should even take the baby's needs into account. Okay? This is about you. Yeah. Guess I'll have another 1,500 miles to decide, right? Right. - Let's just get back on the road and... - Help! - ...not worry about any of this. - Did you hear that? Hear what? Help! Help! Hello? Is someone out there? Help! I'm lost in here. Sounds like he's really in trouble. I've been trying to get to the road, but I can't find it! Okay. We'd better haul him out. It's really hot. Careful. Don't slide down into that ditch. Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing off the side of the road. Kid. Hey, kid, can you hear me? Yes! Help me! I've been stuck in here for days! Tobin? Stop calling. Stop calling, honey. Hello? What's going on? We're lost! Please! Please help! No! Tobin, no! No! There's a woman in there with him. She's being weird. Where are you? Are you coming? Kid, you're right next to us. Can you see the road? No, I can't see anything! Ah, he's right there. Cal, wait. Captain Cal to the rescue! ♪ Da-da-da! ♪ Kid, we're coming! Where are you? - Over here! - Cal, wait. - Slow down. Ugh! - Tobin! Was that your name, Tobin? - Yes! Please hurry! - Emergency services. - Please stay on the line. - I'm tired! - Hello? - Listen... Kiowa County, 911. Okay, Tobin, listen to me. Just sit tight. We're gonna come to you. - Hi, uh... I'm on Route 400. - Help! I don't know the town name, but there's a kid lost in the grass. Tobin! Fuck. Cal? Cal? Fuck. Kid! God. Kid! Where are you? Kid! Becky! - Becky? - I'm fine. I lost the 911 chick. Is your phone working? No, I left my phone in the car. And my glasses. - Tobin! - Are you coming? Please, keep coming. I can't find you. Kid, you sound like you're headed for Nebraska. Stay still! I don't care how scared you are, don't move. Let us come to you. Becky! Becky, where the hell are you? I'm right here. Cal? Something's not right about this. I think we should head back to the road. What about the kid and his mom? Let's just get back together first. I'll keep talking and you work your way back towards me, okay? All right. Good idea. Okay, start talking. What do you talk about when you're lost in a field? Thousands of miles of gabbing, and you can't think of anything to say? There once was a guy named McSweeney Who spilled some gin on his weenie Just to be couth, he added vermouth And slipped his girl a martini Oh, that's charming. Hey, you guys, are you looking for me? I'm scared! Yes. Yes. Hang on. Becky! Becky, keep talking. There once was a woman named Jill Who swallowed an exploding pill They found her vagina in North Carolina... Aah! Stop, stop. I overshot you somehow. Cal, quit fucking around. This isn't funny. Becky? Yeah? You're right, there's something wrong here. All right, let's just do this. On the count of three, we both jump with our hands raised in the air. Can you jump? Yeah, of course I can jump. What do you think? I think you're gonna have a baby this summer, that's what I think. Cal, stop walking away. I didn't move! Yeah. Yeah, you did. You must have! You still are. I'm not. I swear I'm not. Okay, just... Forget it. Let's just do this. All right? - Ready? - Okay. One, two, three! You're close. One more time. - All right. - One, two, three. This is nuts! This is fucking nuts! Becky! Becky! - Becky! - Over here! Beck! Here! Beck! Over here! Becky! Cal? Are you okay? What is it? Nothing! I just... I just slipped. I'm getting a little freaked out here. What are we gonna do? We're gonna get out of here. We just need to keep our heads. - What about the kid? - Forget the kid. This is about us now. Becky! Cal! Becky! Cal? Beck. Cal. Beck, just stay where you are, okay? Don't move. Save your voice. I'm gonna come to you. Becky! Beck! Cal? - Beck! - Cal! Hi, there. You all right? Becky, you there? There's a man here. It's okay, Cal. This is Tobin's daddy. If you wanna get out of here, come with me. If you could get out, why are you still in? I'm looking for my boy and my wife. They're lost in here, too. Look, it's gonna be dark soon. We should stick together. I understand. You don't know me from Adam. Uh... Ross Humbolt's the name. Real estate's the game. Poughkeepsie, wife's Natalie, boy's Tobin. Becky, what's happening? I'm all right, Cal. You can find my brother? Your brother, I'll try, yeah. Not like walking a straight line, though. Nothing is around here. Just follow me, but stay close. Whatever you do, don't lose sight of me, okay? Okay. Hang tight, Cal. We're coming for ya. Becky! Becky! Becky! I'm never gonna find her. You can find things. But it's easier once they're dead. Tobin? The field doesn't move dead things around. Tobin... did you lure us in here? You can tell me. Okay? I won't be mad. No. We heard someone yelling. A man. He was calling for help. That's how we got in. That's how it works. How long have you been in here? I'm not sure. Becky... your sister... she's gonna die soon. How do you know she's my sister? The rock. The rock teaches you to hear the tall grass. The tall grass knows everything. Then... you must know where she is. Yeah? I can find out for you. No... I can do better than that. I can show you. Do you wanna see her? Do you wanna check on her? Come on, follow me. How far are you along? Oh, uh... - Six months. - Oh! I remember when Natalie was pregnant. Those were the salad days. Enjoy it. Enjoy your baby, because it goes fast. Oh. Dad not in the picture? He wasn't ready for it. Well, too bad for him. Hmm. You know... family's everything. If there's one thing I know for certain, it's that simple truth. Well, we better get going. The sooner we get to them, the better. Ross? Hello? Hello? Cal! Are you out there? Cal? Cal! Tobin! Tobin, you gotta wait! Hey, Tobin! Just a little further. Wait. Tobin, wait. Wait up. - Tobin. - Here it is. Wait, please. Wait for me. Oh, my God. Boy, that feels good. Come on, Cal. Try it. Becky! Get away from me! - Get away from me! - Sorry, Cal. Too late. Becky! Wait! You'll never find her that way. Becky! Becky! Becky! Becky! Um... I'm trying to find these two. Have you seen them? ...south breezes today, we've certainly been warming up. That is about to change as another cold front moves in late tonight into the morning. Ahead of that, clouds increase tonight. Humidity level creeps up just a little bit, and that helps to kind of set the stage for some drizzle, possibly, across especially eastern and southeastern counties for your Tuesday. But much cooler weather. It's not gonna be cool. Considering this time of year, abnormally cool. But today was abnormally warm. Becky? Becky? Becky? Becky. What? You okay? Who are you? Shh. Do you hear that? Hear what? Everyone else. If you don't pay attention, they go away. Who do? The people who are stuck in here. But they're not connected to us, so... doesn't matter. We... are connected? Sure. 'Cause you know me. No, I... I don't. You don't remember? - Look, kid, we've never met before. I'm... - Travis. How do you know my name? You're looking for Becky. You... You know Becky? Of course. Wait, how's that even... Who the hell are you? Tobin. Tobin? You really don't remember? Look, do you know where she is? You do, don't you? Hey, you gotta tell me! Tell me! Where is she? Look at me! Where is she? I can show you. - But... - But what? - Are you sure you wanna see her? - Of course! Just... Please. Tobin. All right. But you gotta stay close. There. Becky? Becky? Becky! Becky. No. Becky. Oh, Becky. The field doesn't move dead things. It makes them easier to find. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my... Help! Tobin? Tobin! Well, we don't know whose car it is... Hello? Don't cross the road! - Hello! - Tobin, keep an eye on Freddy. Hey! Hey! I'm stuck in here! Help me! Help me! Hello? Is someone out there? Tobin? Tobin, is that you? Tobin, it's Travis. What, you... you don't remember me now? Over there, Mommy. Do you hear him? What? Where, honey? In the grass. He knows my name. - Are you sure? - Tobin? - It's okay, Freddy. Stay. - Help me! - Get out! Get somebody. - We'll close when I get back next week. Okay? What? - No. No, no, no. I'm telling you. - Freddy! Don't back out of escrow. - You're not overpaying. - Tobin! Damn it! - Ross! - Uh, just a minute, please. Freddy! Toby, stay close. Don't go in there, it's private property. He went after Freddy. Toby! Tobin! Toby, where are ya? - Tobin! - Freddy! Toby, don't worry about Freddy. Just come back to us. Tobin, where are you, honey? Toby! Freddy! Freddy! Tobin! If you're still outside the grass, don't come back in here! Tobin, where are you? I'm over here, Mommy. Tobin Humbolt, didn't you hear your mother? Come back here! Honey, can you see him? - Where is he? - Over here! - Sounds like he's in front of us. - Are you Tobin's dad? Yeah. Who are you? What's going on? - Don't come in here! - Little late for that, buddy. Tobin. Where are you, Tobin? Tobin. Honey, I'm getting scared. It's only a field. That guy, though, I'm not so sure about. Toby, don't let that man get near you, okay? Don't talk to him. If you see him, you run. I'm afraid, Daddy! Did you hear that? He went right by us. - No, honey, no! - Tobin! - He went the other way! - Tobin! Natalie! Natalie, wait! Natalie! Tobin? Natalie! Toby! Natalie! Toby. Natalie. Okay. Okay, Rossy boy. Hold it together. Stay positive. That's what's gonna get you out of this. It's gonna get you out of this. "Mind that's light sells right." "Mind that's light sells right." Right? "The mind that's light sells right." Right? "The mind that's light sells right. The mind that's light sells right. The mind that..." Mind... Fuck. Fuck. This fucking kid. Fucking kid. Can't listen? You can't just fucking listen? Maybe if your mother acted like a mother for once, kept an eye on you. Tobin! Natalie! Help! Help! Hello? Is someone out there? Help! - I'm lost in here! - Sounds like he's in trouble. I've been trying to get to the road... ...but I can't find it! Okay. We better haul him out. It's really hot. Careful. Don't slide down into that ditch. Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing off the side of the road. Help me! Help me! Where are you? Are you coming? There once was a man named McSweeney Who spilled some gin on his weenie Just to be couth, he added vermouth And slipped his girl a martini Oh, that's charming. Hey, you guys, are you looking for me? I'm scared! Yes. Yes. Hang on. Becky! Becky, keep talking. There once was a woman named Jill... - Becky? - ...Who swallowed an exploding pill They found her vagina in North Carolina... Stop, stop. I overshot you. Becky? Becky! Cal, are you in here? Hello? Is someone else out there? Becky, it's me, Travis! Travis? I'm in here! I'm in here, too! What? How... How the hell did you get here? I don't know, but I'm here. Why? Why the fuck are you here? I... I came looking for you. But how did you get here before us? I don't know. But it doesn't matter now. You're here. We're all here. It doesn't matter. Travis? Is that you? Tobin? You okay? I found Freddy. - He's dead. - Freddy? - Someone killed him. - Freddy? Who's Freddy? My dog. His guts are all out. Tobin... are you with Freddy now? Yeah. Okay. Okay, just stay where you are. Okay? Don't move. We're gonna come to you. All right? Just... just keep talking. Do you hear that? Becky? Cal? Yeah, but we already tried that. And it didn't work. Well, this time, I think it might. Follow Tobin's voice, okay? Tobin? Start talking! Like what Becky was doing? Yeah. - Yeah, just like that. - Okay. There once was a man named McSweeney Who spilled some gin on his weenie? Just to be couth, he... Um... I forgot the next part. He put something on his weenie Uh... And then slipped his girl a martini? What's a martini? It's a drink. You're Travis? And that's a dirty rhyme, not for kids. - Becky! - Oh! - Thank God! - Oh, God! It's okay. It's okay. What the fuck is going on? The field... it doesn't move dead things. That doesn't make any sense. Name one thing in here that does. So, explain to us again how you got here. I followed you. You must have been right on our asses the whole way. Oh, no, no. I came after. After what? After... you didn't show up in San Diego. We just left two days ago. No. No, it was longer than that. It was more like... two months. Now, that really doesn't make any sense. I think we have to focus on how the hell we get out. Well, I'm not making Becky blindly walk through Wonderland anymore. - We need some kind of plan. - Well, we can't just sit here. Are you okay? Yeah, fine. - I think we have to get moving. - Yeah. No, I agree. Let's just go. - Well, in which direction? - I don't know! In any direction. Why? What's the point? The point is I don't want to stay here. Someone is watching us. I can feel it. Okay. Tobin, - hop on my shoulders. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Do you see anything other than grass? No. Just grass... and more grass. - Wait! - What? I think I see something. It's a building, I think. That church? No, I can't tell. It's too far away. - Okay, which way is it? - That way. So, you saw our car at the church and you didn't call anybody? No, Cal, I didn't. You still see it? Getting closer. I don't suppose you, um, told anyone where you were headed, did you? No. Not that it'll make much difference. Somebody'll look for us. Your folks are worried sick. What could they do? You ask me, I don't think anyone's coming. You did. Yeah, and... everyone thought I was crazy for trying. Yeah. It's been a while since I checked. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. Fine. Just, um... Just a kick... I think. Is the baby coming soon? She's due in three months. - She? - Yeah. Didn't wanna wait to find out. Ginny is what I'm calling her. For now, anyways, after my great aunt Virginia. Ginny. You don't like it? No. No, it's... It's cool. Old-school. Yeah. She's lively. Moves around a lot. Here. Whoa! Wow. Lively is the word for it. Yeah. Hello? Don't let Cal hurt Travis! Don't leave him! Just stay with him. Or else we're gonna keep making the same mistake! Hello? Who is this? Hello? What's going on? What the hell was that? One more reason to keep moving. Yeah. Becky! Becky? Becky! Beck! Becky! Beck. - Becky! - Wake up! - Move. Move! Move! - Hey! Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Okay. - No, no, no. - Come here. - It's okay. - Come here. - Daddy! - Toby! Oh, thank God. Toby, thank God! Oh! - The baby's moving. - Hey, you okay? It's probably just her condition and a touch of heatstroke. That's all. She's gonna be fine. We all are. You're Ross. You're... Tobin's dad. Yeah. Hey, don't worry. Your mother, she's out there. We're gonna find her, and then we're leaving. All of us. You found a way out? Yeah, I got to the road, but I wasn't gonna leave without my family. How? Well, it's not a straight line. I can say that much. - Which way were you headed? - Towards that building. - Building? - We were almost there. Come here. All right, come on. Up on my shoulders, Tobin. It's gone. That's the way things work around here. But I got the golden ticket, for any takers. Is that CCR? Well, folk song, originally. Let me guess. Lead singer in a band? Four-piece, with a weekly gig at the local? - Kinda. - Hmm. I'm a good judge of people. You gotta be, in my field. Field! Yeah, real estate's my game. We were on a little family vacay through the heartland. It was going pretty well till we ran into you. I... tried to warn you. I'm just giving you a hard time, that's all. I know it's not your fault. Fate conspired. Isn't that always the way? You know, believe it or not, before I ended up here, before, uh, real estate was my game, I played a mean guitar... in a gospel band. Yeah. Me and my Gibson and Jesus were gonna rock the world. But, you know, got married and had a kid, and... Those were the days, though. Still, nothin', but nothin' compares to this. What the hell is it? See for yourself. There's carvings on it. They look really old. Are those native? Oh, I think it's a safe bet it's been here since before the Kiowa hunted on the Osage Cuestas. Older than the hills. Probably was here before the glaciers came and carried the hills away. You realize we're in the center of the contiguous United States. Smack-dab in the middle of the continent. Ah, hell, I'd hazard this stone... is the center of the center. We didn't come here for a goddamn sightseeing tour. You were gonna show us the way out. Oh, but darlin', I have. You just have to look. Is there a map on it or something? Just put your hand on it and you'll know. What's that supposed to mean? Stop! - Nat? - Mommy! Come here. Oh! Been looking everywhere for you. - Thank God you're all right. - Stay away! Stay away from us! Whatever he told you, whatever he said to you, he's lying! What? What are you talking about? You know. All I know, all I care about, is that we're finally together. Everything's gonna be all right now, honey. Now what is it? - What is it, honey? - I saw... I saw her. She was... She was... She was... She was what? She was what? Just say it. She wasn't... She wasn't alive. I saw her on the ground some ways back. I saw her, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. Toby... Mommy's just a little confused right now. Why wouldn't she be? Days without food or water. I am not confused. I saw her. I saw her, and you... You were... You were gonna... I was gonna what? You were gonna hurt me. Hurt you? How could you even think that? We're all in this together. We're like a family now. Right, Travis? We solid? We have to go. We have to go. Look, thanks for your help, mister, but, uh... I think we're gonna go our own way now... Do you wanna come with us? No, just a minute. Just hear me out. This rock, once you touch it, you'll know. It's like a... whoosh! It's... It's better than anything. It's like accepting the host. I know that sounds like blasphemy, but it's true. You think this is just chance? Folks are brought into the grass for a reason. We're all here because we've got stuff to work out. And this rock, in its wisdom, brought our two families together to do just that. All it's asking for is a little faith. Five little fingers on its face and you will be redeemed! All your sins, all your trespasses, all your regrets will melt away and the world will open up like a flower! Oh, it's a beautiful thing. You gotta trust me on this. I think you should let her go. Or what? Look, you don't have the advantage here. Is that a threat? It's pretty simple math. If you think I was doing the soft sell because I was afraid of going the other way, well, you got another think comin'. It's better that you come to the rock on your own. Open your heart to it, like I did. Now, what I really wanna know... is how did you get here? Because the rock wouldn't let you find us unless it wanted you to. Unless this isn't about you. Right. I get it. This is about me. Looking for the hard sell? Yeah. Sure, I'm game. Travis! No! - No! - Go! - No! - Go! Travis! Stop! Stop! - Cal! Cal! - No. Come with... Cal, help him! - Please! - I'm no fibber. When you touch that rock, you'll know everything I know. Everything the grass knows, including how to leave. Only, you won't want to. Tobin! Run! Run! - Mom! No! - No! - No! - Mommy! Mommy! No. Don't worry, son. - It's just flesh. - Mommy! - And all flesh is grass. - No! Mommy! No! Mommy! No! Mommy! Mommy! Go! Go! Get out! Save your breath, kids. You can't run from redemption. He's right, you know? Where are we gonna go? Freddy! Come on! Come on! Hurry! Cal! What are we gonna do? He'll find us. For sure, he'll find us. Listen to me. First thing we have to do is you need to take hold of my hand. It's okay, Tobin. My daddy's right. We're grass. We keep dying and coming back. - Like Freddy did. - One, two... Here. Come here. Come here. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay. - I didn't know what to do. - Yeah, you sure didn't. Well, we wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for you. Okay, blaming each other isn't gonna solve anything. Well, all indicators are that there's no way to solve this. If we're just gonna go round and round in circles, I'll feel a lot better saying what we all know. It's not that simple. Are you forgetting the detail that he completely abandoned you? That he totally threw you away? That he wanted you to abort your own baby? Becky... I'm sorry. - I just wanted... - You just wanted to what? Look after me? Protect me? I need food. I need water. I need a place to sleep. What I don't need is any more brotherly love. No. Cal's right. I was an asshole. And I made a mistake. A big one. But that's not the real reason you don't like me. Is it, Cal? It's a good start. No, it's a good excuse, but it's not the reason. You didn't want me around even before there was a baby. The truth is, there's nothing that I could have done to make you like me, because no one is ever gonna be good enough for your little sister. - A high school diploma would be nice. - You know what? I'm not quite the fuckup that you think I am! Oh, no. No, no. You're a real rock star. You've sacrificed everything for that ridiculous, infantile fantasy, and now we're all suffering for it. And you're a real hero. Playing hubby to your little sister? That's the next best thing to fucking her, which is what you really want, isn't it? Guys, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Open up! Come on, this way! Redemption is coming! Come on. You okay? Come on, hurry! - Get the door! - Yeah. Okay. He's not gonna get through that without a sledgehammer. I wouldn't be so sure about that. What are we gonna do? We're stuck up here! No, listen to me. When I drove here, I saw this building from the road. We saw it, too. Yeah. The church, it was just on the other side. Okay. - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's fine. My God, there it is. Spitting distance. Only thing is, we go in that grass again and we're back to square one. Freddy? Fucking dog gives me the creeps. Where'd he go? There, on the road. A hole. There's a hole. The way out? You think that's it? Maybe. But we're not there yet... Tobin. Tobin, I... Becky, we've gotta get out of here. Where's Travis? He's coming. Holes are everywhere, Calvin, my boy. Life's full of 'em! Tobin, come back! - Travis! - Beck, we have to keep moving! We can't just leave! I'll come back for him, but we have to get you out! I found a way. It's... It's right there. Travis! - We're so close! - Travis! Beck, I'm your brother, and I'm telling you right now to forget about that asshole. Did you do something? Beck. I love you. - Get away from me. - Beck. No, wait. - Beck, wait. - No... - Beck, please. - No... Please, Beck. Wait. Thought that you would lose your sister when you got out of here. That the baby would bring her and Travis together, you'd be left out in the cold. You're probably right on that score. Your mistake is thinking you're ever leaving. I'm impressed. Yeah. Of course, I was a bit of a track star back in the day. Played some ball, too. I know. I know. I know. You're thinking if you had just turned left instead of right, you could've gotten away from me. But you did go left, and you turned right. And you kept running and didn't turn at all. But here, in the garden of forking paths, you didn't make any one choice. You made every choice. And they all led back to me. Travis? Travis! Becky? Becky? Becky? Becky? Becky? Travis? You okay? I'm scared. Travis, where are you? What happened? Your brother... I think he loves you a little too much. But this isn't his fault. I did this. I had my chance with you, and I threw it away. Whatever happens... I want you to know I... I'm glad you didn't listen to me. I'm glad you kept Ginny. Becky? There's, um... There's something I didn't tell you. I was gonna give her up. I got scared. I didn't think I was ready to be a mom. That's why we were, um, going to San Diego. There was a family there. You don't want that anymore? What difference does it make now? We're gonna get out of here. I'm gonna find a way. Our baby deserves to live. She's a strong one. I feel her kicking. I wish I could just touch your hand. It's right here. Becky? Get away from me! Becky, what's going on? How funny. This is where I tussled with Natalie for the first time. I tried to show her the way, but she just wouldn't listen. Come on. You wanna touch the rock, darlin'? Huh? You wanna lay on it naked? Wanna feel me in you? Beneath the pinwheel stars while the grass sings our names? It's poetry, huh? Blood is nice, but tears are better for an old, thirsty rock like that. It has to be quick, though. Don't wanna do it in front of the kid. No! No! No! Travis! Travis! Hello? Listen to me. Don't let Cal hurt Travis. Don't leave him. Just stay with him. Or else we're gonna keep making the same mistakes forever. Hello? Who is this? Hello? What's going on? Baby... Baby... Little baby... Baby... - It's okay. - Baby... Here, here, here, here. No, not too fast. I don't want you to get sick. - May I have a look? My baby? - It's okay. - I've got her. I've got her. - Baby... She's right here. I've got her. Isn't she great? Out of the oven and baked just right. Aren't you the Mother Mary? Wonder when the Wise Men will come. I wonder what gifts they'll have for us. Hmm... There once was a farmer from Leeds Who swallowed a bag full of seeds - Big bunches of grass... - Mm. ...sprouted out of his ass... And his balls... - grew all shaggy with weeds - Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm... Cal... What is that? What am I eating? Grass. It's just grass. And seeds and so on. Mm. Cows do it all the time. Here's another piece. Mm. - It's good for you. - Mm. It's good for your soul. Mm. Mm. - Yeah. - Mm. You ate it all. Yeah. That's a good girl. It tastes like... Like what? Like... Like... You? Becky? Becky! Becky? Baby. Baby. Oh, no. Oh. Oh, please. Please, no. My daddy killed the baby. I know he did. I found Cal. He killed him, too. This is never gonna stop. He's gonna keep killing us over... and over... and over again. And it's never gonna stop. I'm not gonna let him hurt you. But he's watching us right now. You out there, Ross? Why hide? Huh? If you wanna finish us, then just do it already! I'm here! You see? I'm waiting! Travis! No. I don't see. Your honey took my eye out. But you know what? Eyes are deceiving around here. I'm better off without it. Dad! Too bad, kid. I liked ya. Saw a seed of myself in there. Dad, no! No, Dad. No! All I wanted... was to help you find redemption. Stop! God knows you're the one who needed it the most. Maybe next time. Travis! Ready for yours? No! Gorgeous, isn't she? - No! - It wants you to touch it. This field needs it. More than the rain. It's so easy, son. Redemption is so very, very easy. I'm not coming back here! And neither are you! Travis, don't. Don't. No. No. No! No! If you touch it... you'll never leave. Travis? Follow me. I'm not leaving. But you... you don't belong here. And neither does Becky. Don't let them in. Don't let them in, Tobin. Help! Hello? Is someone out there? Help! I'm lost in here. Sounds like he's really in trouble. I've been trying to get to the road, but I can't find it! Okay. We better haul him out. No! Don't go in there! Wait! No! Don't go in there! Stay away from it. Stay away. Are you okay? Help! Wasn't he just... Didn't we hear him... Help! Don't listen to him. Get back in the car. You have to go. - Kid, where are your parents? - It doesn't matter. Please. - We just have to go. Get in the car. - Okay. - I can't find my way out! - What do we do? I mean, it sure sounds like he's in trouble. No. No! No, don't let him go in! If he goes in, you'll go in and you'll never get out. - Please! - Okay... Please. Are you coming? Help me! - Where did you get this? - Travis. Cal, wait! Get back here right now. Hey! Don't leave! Look. He said he got this from Travis. Travis? I'll explain later, I promise. But right now, we have to go. Please. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey. Are you okay? We have to go. What about the kid? Can you hear me? Where are you? You've gotta help me get out of here! Something's not right about this. We need to leave. - Please. - All right, get in. Help me! Please! Don't leave! It's okay. It's gonna be okay. - Wait. - What? What? Let's take him to Topeka. Find a police station. - That's back the way we came. - Yeah, I know. I thought we said we were gonna go on. I should've never left. Are you sure? What about that family in San Diego?
