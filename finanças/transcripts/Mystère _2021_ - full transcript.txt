You okay, sweetheart? THE GENTLEMEN MOVERS I thought I'd bring your books up. Here. It's your favorite, right? The one with dinosaurs. Have you seen the view? Oh, hey, look. Uncle Thierry's coming. Ah! There she is, my little lovebug. Mmm! How are you, princess? Come here. Let me have a look at you. So grown up! Ah! You're old man's here? Hi! I brought you a local delicacy, native to Lyon. I'm not sure if you've ever tried pizza! We weren't expecting you yet. Come on. Are you serious? I had to come see your castle. I mean I've heard... so much about it. - Well, here it is. - Here it is. I guess it's, uh... So this is where you grew up? - I didn't grow up here. - Oh, no? We'd come on the weekends. - Ah! - Me and my parents. It's, uh... It hasn't been lived in for years. Wouldn't have guessed. Here it is. It's gonna be great. - Right? - Uh, I mean, sure... Sure it will. It's super unique. I mean... A little spooky, but it's cute. Right, you wanna show me around a little? Where's your room? Okay. Hey! Wait for me! She still listening to her mother's playlist? Yeah. And she still won't talk to me. Nothing's changed since we lost Mathilde. I'm doing great. Hey, none of this is because of you. Look, you took a sabbatical, okay? And if it's good for Victoria, then great, I'm all for it. But you need to stop being so hard on yourself. Did I make the right decision in bringing her here? Of course. No. No, no. This is bad. It's a horrible idea. There are no shops. Only four people in this town. I'm sure I'll be attacked by a bear on my way home. This place is a nightmare. You really are a jerk. Anyway, you'll come see us, right? It's only five hours. Obviously I will. Who else would bring drinking water out to you? You're such an idiot. Who cares if it was a good idea. You're here now, and that's that. Huh? And I'll come visit you in the boonies every weekend. I mean it. You're stuck with me. Yeah. Come here. - All right? I'll see ya. - Mmm-hmm. I was thinking we could go shopping later. That way, we can see the village. Why don't you think of what you want, and then, uh, make me a list. Anything you want. Chocolate or... How about a... Victoria, look at me. I need to talk to you. I'm going for a walk, all right? I need to get some air. But, uh... But don't feel pressured, if you'd rather... stay here all alone in this big house. It's really up to you. Okay? I'd prefer it if you come with me, but you don't have to, it's whatever you want. Well, see ya. 'Cause I'm heading out. Not bad, huh? Your mom and I used to love coming here. We'd hike up here and... We'd do this hike and... Then she would... It stinks up here, huh? Can you smell that? Huh? What is that? Is that what smells? Come on! It's poop! Look! We're surrounded by poop! Come on. Let's head back down. Careful. Great. Now where are we? Hold on one sec. Sorry, it's actually this way. Hang on, hang on. Here we go. All right, careful. Be careful. Watch the wire. All right, we're good now. We'll be okay. See, look. Someone's down there. Excuse me, sir! Hello! Sorry to bother you, but we're a little lost. It's really beautiful here. - Thank you. - It's nice, huh? - It is. - Do you like it? Oh, yeah, it's great. Drink it, sweetheart. It's good. That's pure mountain water. No, no. I collect rainwater. Oh? Okay. You can look around if you want. Are you sure? Is it safe? Of course. The only danger here is the people, not the animals. Is there anywhere that I can maybe wash my hands? Have you been, uh, living out here long? Sweet, isn't he? Does he have a name? Mystery. Hello, Mystery. My name is Victoria. He's a very special animal, this one. Here, a gift from the forest. Thanks again. No, I mean it. Thank you. I never would've found it. Get home safe. No, you don't like being in there, do you? Here, Mystery. Hold on, don't move. Mmm. There you go. Yeah. Victoria! Are you coming down? What are you doing? Victoria? What are you doing? Are you okay? Ready to eat? Come on. Come on. Come on. There you go. I'll be back tonight. Stay in here. Dad can't know you're here. Victoria! See you tonight. Stay there. Your new classmates look fun. Hmm, that guy looks like a serial killer. - What's a cereal killer? - Don't worry about it. - What did you just say? - What's a cereal killer? It's amazing what you just said. Could you... could you maybe say that again? Cereal killer. - Again? - Cereal killer. - Again? - Cereal killer. - Again? - Cereal killer. - Mr. Dutel? Hi. - Yes? My name's Mr. Darmet, I'm the new school principal. Hello. Stéphane. My daughter, Victoria. Ah, the new student. Hey, sweetheart, you okay? Yeah? He's new, just like you. Sorry. Excuse us, we're a little excited. Yes, I can imagine. Ulysse! You... You can't shoot things at the principal! Uh, I'm off. See you tonight. You'll pick me up later? Of course I'll pick you up. I'll bring you a snack after school. - Whatever you want. - Uhh... Maybe just cookies. What? Chocolate cookies. All right. I'll bring cookies. Cereal killer. That's beautiful. Come on, sweetie, you're gonna be late. Hurry! Go, go, go! Ooh! Ugh! Don't look at me like I'm a terrible mother. Uh, no, not at all. I wasn't thinking that. That's all I need right now. It's my ex-husband. - Ah! - He is a complete mess. He promises to be here, but then flakes on us. - Oh, I see. - But it's a huge dilemma. Make sure you're up for your son's first day of school, or stay under the covers with your 27-year-old one night stand? I mean, tough choice. I mean, seriously though. Our kids should be our focus, right? - Am I right? - Uh, yeah. Yes. I know this is all a little personal. - It's all right. - How about your wife? She isn't here? Ah, no. No, no. - And she's fine with that? - With what? Well, missing the first day of school. No, because, she's um... Actually, she's deceased. That's a great excuse for not getting up in the morning! My ex hasn't pulled that one! No, really. That's a good one. No, seriously, my wife passed. I'm a widower. Really, I mean, she died, so... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay, actually. I mean, I never thought I'd laugh about it, uh... Not bad, then. Well done. - Stéphane. How are you doing? - Anna. - Sorry. - No worries. Hey! Hey, your backpack! - Thierry? - Yes, it's me. Hey. - Victoria. - Yes? - She... she's speaking. - No! No, that's huge. I mean... When did this happen? This morning, just like that, on the way to school. - She hasn't said that much, but... - Well, sure. But still, it's great! - It's a slow progress. But, uh... - Well, sure. I'm just relieved. That's great, Stéph. - I'm so happy right now. - I know. You coming down for your snack? Victoria? I'm coming, Dad! You what? I didn't hear you. One sec! I'm coming! Oh, got it. "One sec! I'm coming!" Okay, do you know Pikachu? Or do you know about Pokémon? Well, I love them. Here, let me explain. See, this is Charmander. He evolves into Charmeleon, and then after Charmeleon, he evolves into Charizard. Here, look. If a Pokémon has a master with a pure heart, then there's no way he'll ever turn bad. So we'll say you're my Pokémon. But don't worry, you'll be okay. The man said that my heart is pure. Victoria, can I have your dirty laundry? Victoria? Is that it? Okay. Oh! Ugh! What happened to these pajamas? What did you do in here? What is that? There's a dog in your room. Care to explain? I got him from the man. He's a gift. Uh, what man? From the man at the cabin, when you got us lost in the woods. The man... Hang on... Look, Dad, he's so cute, isn't he? Can we keep him? Please? - Dad, please, can we? - Mmm... Please, Dad? So, what exactly did the man say? He said he was a gift from the forest. Ah! Okay, that was nice of him. And, uh, what else? He said he needs a master with a pure heart, - like... like in Pokémon. - Ah! Great! That's just great. You know he needs a family, Dad. Hmm. Welcome to the family, little guy. Yay! Thank you so much! Sure, but you have to take care of him. He's your responsibility. Thanks. MYSTERY Mystery has slightly slanted eyes that are shaped like almonds. He's soft and loves tummy rubs. I found him at an old man's house in a big cabin. Since then, he's gotten bigger and bigger and now we're best friends. Thank you, Dad! Does he eat meat? He eats meat, or he'll have some biscuits or cookies. Does he ever get in trouble? He ate my slippers once. Does he have long ears? Uh, yes, and they're pointed. I LIKE POOP! Okay, that's enough. Come on, Mystery. I have to get to school, come on. - Come on, let's go you two. - I know. Aww! He's cute. - Thanks. - Wait. Your backpack. - What's his name? - Mystery. - Say hello, Mystery. - Oh, cute dog. - Oh, hi! - Hi, Baptiste. - Here. - Come on, we're running late. - Morning, Stéphane. - Hey. - Victoria! - I'm coming. - Okay, say bye. - Give me a kiss. - See you later. - All right, go on. - See you later. Be good. - Hey, don't I get a kiss? Never mind, you can give me one tonight. Where'd you get him? It's, uh... it's a long story. We got lost in the mountains and we met this man, and he gave him to Victoria. He's really skittish, isn't he? Yes. Hold on. There you go. He's always a little restless in the mornings. - I don't know why. - Did he say what breed he was? No, but I think he's part sheepdog. I don't know much about dogs. - He has big paws though. - Yeah? Do you know a lot about dogs then? - Well, yeah, I work in conservation. - Yeah? Has he been vaccinated yet? No, not yet. Look, I gotta run. But come, stop by. I can take a look at him, and we can get him his shots. - It's just there. - Okay. See ya! So when you say "big paws," that means he could be a Saint Bernard? Come by, we'll figure it out. - All right, see you later. - Yes, see you later. The wolves or us, we must decide! DANGER WANTED - WOLVES DEAD OR ALIVE Hey, what do you call that, huh? Come on! WHO SAVES THE SHEPHERDS KILLS SHEEP NO TO WOLVES Once is enough! WANTED - WOLVES DEAD OR ALIVE Wolves must go! This all must end! Everyone get ready! The show's about to begin! Ah! She's a completely different person. She's stopped having those nightmares. Getting that dog was the best idea you ever had. Yeah, we'll see. He has huge paws, so I hope he doesn't turn out to be massive. Like a... Saint Bernard. Oh, no, no. Come on, Saint Bernards are bigger, chubbier. - Really? - I mean... Yeah. - So what breed do you think he is? - Well, he's... He's a husky, isn't he? A what? A husky. You know, the ones that pull the sleds. Oh, you're right. You're right, he's a sled dog! They're really sweet, aren't they? - Oh, poor thing. - Well... Take that thing off him. - He looks good. - Dad, no. He likes it. - Huh, Mystery. Hey! - Here, Mystery. Mystery, go see Uncle Thierry. Go on, it's okay. Oh, look how cute you are. - Wait! You're burning it! - Okay, here we go. - I'll put it on the plate, okay? - The barbecue's on fire! They're completely burned! Look, they're all red and burned on the outside. That's enough! No, it is not enough. Unbelievable! What if I'd done her operation myself? Well, it's true. You're right. You're the best surgeon in the world. You're the only one who could've saved her. It was terminal. And when I look at Victoria, I can decide to either see my sister, or to see my niece, who's doing great, because her dad's amazing. Give it time, okay? Keep going. I really miss her. Me too. And you? Where's your mom at? GROCERY STORE You decided not to come? What do you mean? The other day, when I said you should stop by my office. It was just a favor. I won't be offended if you took your dog somewhere else. - Oh, that. - Yeah, that. Are you mad at me? No, no, I just... I actually found a really good vet somewhere else, so I didn't want to offend you. Look, it's fine. I really don't mind. - So, did he have a good checkup then? - He's in great shape. So what breed is he? A husky. A little sled dog. Did a vet actually tell you he's a husky? Well, he's not a vet per se, he's a friend who... He knows, so... - Oh, right. Okay. - Yeah. We can agree that that's not a husky. It's not? Uh, what do you think he is? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but... Come here, Mystery. Come here. Well, he's probably not a dog. And if he's not a dog, then he has to be a wolf. A wolf? No, that's impossible. - Have a vet examine him, all I'm saying... - No, I mean... I would know. I would have noticed by now. Not necessarily. Listen, I know it's been difficult at home with Victoria... - You don't know. - But he's... You can't even imagine. Hang on. Hey. That's weird. There's no other tracks. Must be a loner. That's why it didn't attack. Think it's still in the area? Not sure. Either way, it won't touch my flock. Never again. Let's get them in. Victoria! Come on, let's go! Here, come look! - Oh, the kennel looks amazing, Dad! - You like it? Come on, let's see if he'll go in. Go on, get in. Dad, who is that? - What's he doing on our property? - Nothing. He must just be lost. Let's go, bath time. All right, that's enough brushing. Time for bed. Come on, brushing your teeth shouldn't take two hours. Let's go! - Your turn, Mystery. - No, no. Enough with his teeth. He's good. Come on, Mystery. Time for bed. Hey, we talked about this. No, you promised me. But he'll get scared without me at night. No, he won't get scared. No, no. You stay there. Stay there. That's it. Lie down, good boy. Good boy, stay down here. You gotta understand that... he's too big, he can't be sleeping in here with you anymore. Ah, you gotta be kidding. Dad, come on, please? You see he can't sleep without me. Right, Mystery? You okay, Uncle Thierry? Come on, follow me. Come on! Come on! Victoria, call him back. He's going too far. Where are we going? - How far are we hiking? - Mystery! - What is it now? - Huh? Nothing. It's these boots. These things are killing me. I told you you should've put on real hiking boots. I know, I know. "I told you so..." Hey, what's going on? What's wrong? - Huh? - No, I... I'll be gone for Christmas. So, yeah, I won't be here, because I'll be away. Okay, you'll be away. What does that mean? Look, I found somewhere sunny and... it's booked. I'm sorry I won't be here. Well, um... uh... It's no big deal. Go. Have fun. Where are you going? Punta Cana. Yes. It's a five-star resort. So go! - But stop complaining. - Well... Didn't want to say anything, but we're getting pretty far away from the house. - You're such a pain! - Mystery! You gotta enjoy yourself. - Mystery! - Where are we? - Just come on. - Mystery! Mystery! Victoria. Back up slowly. Back up slowly. That's it, slowly. Straight to me. Go slow, go slow. Easy. Go slow. Come on. That's it. That's it, right to me. Come here. Hey. Mystery, come here. Come here. Come on. Mystery, come here. Come here. - A husky? - I just sell cars, all right? A husky! OPRB Canis lupus 100%. Shit. Thanks. Well, I don't have good news. Okay, what is it? He's a gray wolf, purebred. Without a doubt. Ooh. - He's got to be released, Stéphane. - Hold on, hold on. Hold on. We don't care. We don't mind, actually. - Look, that's not the point. - No, it's a predator, Stéph. That's what she said. Mystery could attack us at any second. Ah, well, no. We're not at risk. It has to do with the sheep farmers. It's complicated, all right? Wolves are a real problem for them, okay? I'm sorry, but he needs to go to a nature reserve. Where are these reserves? Well, Holland has an amazing one. I've been. He'll be really happy there. Look, she has to see him every day. Well, Italy has a few places. Every day. Uh, there's a park in the Vosges. Look, I'll make a call and see if they have any space. Every day, I said. - I think you're missing the point here. - Yes, I get the point. I know what you mean. But you need to believe what I'm saying. She needs to see him every day. I mean, what? She's supposed to say goodbye in a parking lot. Hey, Dad. Can we go now? Yes, yes, I'm coming. I'm coming. Okay, look... Go home with Mystery. The three of you spend one last evening together. But tomorrow, he has to go. I'm giving you the number. Hmm? Thanks. So what do we do about Mystery? We'll figure it out. What are you doing with Mystery? Well, you said you wanted a bigger kennel. Here you go. And this way, he'll be safe. Hmm? Here, I'll show you how to close it. Come on, in you go. Shh, shh. Don't make any noise, Mystery. It's going to be okay. Don't be sad. Because Dad said, "We never abandon our family." We'll always have each other, I promise. You're safe here. Don't worry. Hey, where are you going? Come here. No, no, no. Where are you going? Get in. There you go. All right, sweetheart. We gotta go, we're late. Come on. Hurry. Close the door. Let's go. Good morning. You need help with anything? - Just visiting farms. - Oh yeah? Why? There's a wolf in these woods. - Ah. - It killed two of my ewes. If you have any animals, uh, best lock 'em up. No, look, we don't have any animals. But I thought you had a dog. Yeah, we did, but not anymore. Did you need anything else? Because we're late. We have to get to a school play. Let's go, we're already late. It's Halloween. Goodbye then. Let me know if you see it in the area. Yes. I'll be sure to call the police. Here. I packed your sweater and a snack. Didn't peg you as someone who was into weird hats, you know? It suits you. Wow. How about your makeup, huh? In my bedroom, every night, A pretty skeleton appears with glee He's super cool, this scary ghoul And even sleeps near me In my room, there he lies A pretty wolf, with silver eyes He sleeps next to me And he's a part of my family forever And from now on, we'll be together Shit, that's a wolf! They've hidden a wolf here! In my room, there he lives A pesky monster, this little kid He hides in the walls Ha, ha, ha! Hold on. - He burrows underground, he looks proud - Yes, hello? Mrs. Reynault? Yes. I'm in Salins, at Dutel's. I'll call you back. Mystery. Stéphane. Hey, honey, you gotta let him go now, okay? All right. Oh, Victoria, don't. No, no, no. - No, wait. - No, come here. - No, stay here. - No, let me go! Hey, no, Victoria, please. - He's not bad! He's my friend. - I know. Leave me alone. Mystery. Mystery. He isn't bad. He was my friend. Mystery, it can't be over. It can't be over. No, leave me alone! I hate you! No! Don't leave me, Mom! Mom. Mom, no! Mom, don't leave me, please. You were having a nightmare. - It's okay. You had a nightmare. - No. It was just a nightmare. It's okay. It's okay. Hello! Hey! Anyone here? Hey! Well, where the hell did you go? - Hey, whoa. Not so loud. - You are here. - Let me in! - I'm coming. Oh, wow, nice tan! Well, yeah! I was in Punta Cana. Here, look, presents! - Come in. It's cold out. - Hold this. This cheese is pretty good, huh? I almost forgot. I got you... Huh? - More? - Yes. A bit of rum from Puerto Plata. Near Santiago de Los Caballeros. Caballeros, hmm? In fact, this rum was Christopher Columbus' favorite. Well, "ron," because that's how they say it over there, "rone." Here. Hmm. Thanks, Thierry. Hey, sit down. Victoria, sit down and finish your dinner, please. It's been bad. I'm sick of this. Why don't I stay a few days, huh? Mmm-hmm. I even packed my PJs. I miss you, Mystery. Look, shooting at wolves creates real risks. The dominant male hunts, we know that. If he's killed, the pack splinters and they go off independently. It's not a solution. It creates more attacks. So, what's your solution then? Do nothing. Watch them devour our sheep? Ask Pascal, see what he thinks about it. Good morning. Morning. I brought my daughter to help her understand what's happening here. Little bit late. I don't know. You don't seem to be able to agree so it's never too late, is it? Listen, my daughter thinks that wolves aren't a threat to humans. Wolves have attacked humans. Those were in isolated cases, though, remember? We haven't yet confirmed that wolves are any risk to humans. Look, we have to protect the flocks, that's true. But wolves are here, so we have to learn to live with them. But we don't want the wolves. Do you get that? - I had ten attacks last year. - Yes, I know, Jean-Paul. Okay, so then if it happens again, what am I supposed to do? You get compensation for the attacks, Jean-Paul. I don't care about compensation, okay? I'm sick of this! I work like a dog, all right? All year round! And it's not to have my sheep killed! I love my flock. I do. Does that make sense? We don't cause any harm. We keep this region alive. And what do we get? Nothing! I mean, what do they want? For us to move on? To go live in the city like everybody else? The government wanted the wolves back, and now we have to pay. Are we clear? So do something, or we're using our guns, got it? Enough of this crap. We're not gonna just take this lying down. I always said that we should use our guns. Exactly, let's get our guns. - Are you okay? - Mmm. You sure? It's not his fault. Last time the wolves took out half his flock. What's more is it was pretty close to the Lioran cable car. Lioran? How is that possible? Well, wolves learn to adapt. They move in and they get close to the villages. When people feel threatened, they fight back in defense. People are stronger than the wolves. It's not fair, but that's how it is. All right, thanks. - See you. - See you later. If you hate wolves, why did you let me get Mystery? Hey, I like the wolves just fine. It's just that, at first, we thought he was a dog, right? You did. Not me. Because I always knew. All right. Uh, well, I didn't know that he was. Otherwise... he wouldn't have been able to stay with us. Wolves aren't meant to be pets, they're dangerous. That's a lie, he's not dangerous. What happened to all the game around here? And the monsoon rainfall's a disaster. This is a really lovely picture you have here. Huh, Victoria? So what is this a picture of? Listen, um, I know it isn't easy for you at the moment, huh? But I'm pretty sure that the girl that you drew has things to say, doesn't she? She feels things... - Can I go to the bathroom? - Sure. Yes. Yes, of course. Mystery, it's you. You're here, Mystery! Come on. It's dangerous for you here. Let's go. Follow me. You have to hide. Come on. Mmm-hmm. Mystery, are you coming? You're beautiful, Mystery. Yes, you are. You're beautiful. I missed you. I really did. It's okay. Shh. Mystery, wait for me. Thanks. Maybe we should go. - Go where? - The mayor's reception. Sure, when is it? Friday. Uh, no, tomorrow. Stéphane! Did you get my texts? Uh, no, I don't think so. Why? - Mystery escaped from the reserve. - What? Wait, when? He's been gone for about a week. How is that even possible? Isn't the place enclosed? That would defeat the point. Where's Victoria? At school. She had to stay behind. Why? Well, he could be looking for her. He could come back. From the Vosges? An adult wolf can travel hundreds of miles just to find its pack, and she's his pack, so yeah. It's her teacher. Hold on, it's Darmet. Hello? Hello? Hold on. One sec, I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? Do you want an espresso or anything? Oh, sure. That sounds great. How are you, Céline? - Hey. I'm good. - Could we have two espressos, please. Am I bothering you? Uh, no. No problem. So, listen, I was curious because you work with animals. I just got back from Punta Cana, it was a five-star hotel, actually. We went on a nature hike. And I found a massive group of baby turtles. Really special. They were amazing. They told us they were from Greece. Have you heard of those? It's Éric, right? - No, Thierry. - Ah, Thierry. Sorry. Quit it. - Huh? - Quit it. Okay, thanks. What is it? What's going on? She's missing. She's, uh, not at school. I have to go to Puy Mary, because I guess she was seen there with a big dog. Okay, I'll let the police know about it. Uh... Victoria! Victoria! Mystery, wait for me! Victoria! Mystery! Mystery! Stay with me, Mystery. Mystery? Hey! Hey. Hold on. Wait. Victoria! Victoria. Victoria, talk to me. Please talk to me. I was with Mystery. - Okay. I know. I know. Here. - He was with his family. Come on, it's okay. I got you. Let me take her. Come on. She okay? I've made up the back bedroom. It's a little cramped, but, uh... it's comfortable. - Did she fall asleep? - Yes. A second ago. Thanks. Thanks for putting us up for the night. Ah. Want some tea? Thanks. Careful, it's really hot. That took courage, huh? Hiking through the mountains when it's this cold out. I mean, I drove here and I got frostbite. Come on. Why did you run off on your own like that? I wanted to save Mystery. I wanted to get him somewhere where he'd be safe. Are you sure it was Mystery? Yeah. Yeah, it was. I saw him. But I couldn't save him. I failed. You know, they're in the middle of a wolf culling at the moment. A few bullets won't solve the sheep farmers' problems, right? It's true. You know that. - Sure, but I don't make the laws, okay? - Right. They've put that in an official ruling. My hands are tied. They're all idiots. Hey! You see anything? I can't tell. I think these are tracks. Not sure. - Go ahead, I'll catch up. - Okay. I know he'll come back to see me. I'm sure. Maybe he's with his family in the mountains. He could be. Back with his pack, huh? That's good, it's normal. If anything goes wrong, that'll be my fault. Hmm. - Oh, Mystery, it's you. - No, no. - Victoria, wait. Come back! - Mystery! Hey, Victoria, don't! Hold on! - No! - No, Victoria! - No, Mystery! - Come back! No! Wait! - No! Come back! No! - Victoria! No! Oh my God! Don't die, Mystery. Don't die. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I promise, I didn't see her there. Victoria! It's okay, sweetheart. - She could've been shot! - I know. My God, come on, let him breathe. - No, Mystery. - Let go. Let go. I don't want to leave him. Oh, shit, he's not gonna make it. - We got to get him to Aurillac. - It's too far. How about your lab? I don't have the equipment, but I think Bruno has what we need. We can do it here, okay? Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold him, come on. - On three. - No, Mystery. One, two, three. - You got him? Okay. - Yeah. - Is he gonna he die? - No, don't worry, sweetie. He's not gonna die. My dad will save you. Don't be scared. Can you pass me the disinfectant? All right. Why don't we go outside, sweetheart? Come on. Let's let your dad work. Are you cold? Hey. It's all gonna be okay. Did you save him? - Mmm-hmm. - Really? Yay! You're the best surgeon in the world, Dad! Dad, you're the best! You did it. Go see him. Go on. Mystery! Stéphane! I got it! We're good. I have the official authorization. Look, he could stay over in the valley near Impramau. And the farmers all agreed to this? I mean... They know it's good for the town and good for their flocks. How's Mystery doing today? - Really well. Mmm-hmm. - Yeah? - And Victoria? - She's okay. She's over there with him. The scar's in good shape. It's healing nicely. All clean. He's still taking his pills? Yes. I'm still giving him the little capsules, crushed into his meat. - He's been really good. He eats it all. - That's great. And his exercises? Is he in less pain at all? A bit. He's walking and he's even started running again. You'd make a great vet, you know? It's amazing. He's doing great. Yeah. - You think he's ready? - Yeah. You ready, sweetie? I guess so. Are you sure? I know it's what's best. Come on, Mystery. You know you can't keep living with humans. It'd be too dangerous. And, well, I can't come live with wolves. Do you understand? No one can ever separate us. Don't worry, I'll never forget you. But, now, Mystery, it's time to go. You have to go now. Go on, Mystery. Victoria. Look, they're here. Go ahead, Mystery! Go home to your family! Go on, go, Mystery! Are you all right? Yeah. Should we go home now?
