Real World San Francisco Season 29 I know we had fun. We did a lot of things that they didn't show. -I hope you got that. -Why? I don't know why they didn't air it. That was quality. That was... I don't know why they didn't air that. Look into my eyes. There were so many times where I was just like, why and what am I doing? Oh, my God. Yeah, we had some good times out there. We had some fun out there. There was so much... There was so much dumb shit. I wish they would've shown. Oh, my gosh, I remember... This was hilarious. We went to a burlesque show, and they had an air-hump competition. And Arielle, of course, entered it, and then finally, we convinced Jay to go downstairs and do it with her, to be a partner with her. Jay would be the last person that I would expect to be on that stage doing anything. But here he was, getting practically air-ed by Arielle, yeah. Arielle was air-Jay. And it was intense. Arielle wrapped a belt around my neck at one point. Dry-humped me, threw me to the floor and, like, beat me. It... it got bad. There may have been a belt around his neck, and I, like, rode him in front of, you know, 200 people. You know, there's nothing more embarrassing than being manhandled like that, though, you know. I think Jay's manhood is still on the stage. She won. Let's... let's clarify. We won first place. -You win a beautiful hitachi... -I won the biggest vibrator I've ever seen in my life, ever. A really expensive vibrator, like, $250 one or something. I was like, I didn't know that they could be that expensive. -That's cool. -So thank you, Jay. Well, I'll tell you what I remember. What I remember from this erotic dinner is that the food was fan... tastic, okay? I thought what you showed was bad enough. This is gonna get worse? Also in front of you is a menu that's got a little ribbon wrapped around it. There is a prize at the end of the night for the most creative use of the ribbon. The goal of the night, or the game of the night, was we got these little ribbons, tied around our menus, and whoever could think of the best spots to tie them in would win a prize, and the prize was a lap dance. We tied my ribbon... So I'm grabbing Jamie's boob. And she ties her ribbon on my belt so she's, like, grabbing my, so I can't go to the restroom. Like, we can't leave. We can't walk anywhere. Jamie and I won, so, I mean, let me tell you this. We started getting lap dances, and I'll tell you how awkward it is to have your girlfriend's hand on your... and then getting a lap dance. It's a little strange. There was some sexy topless women there at the dinner, I mighta had a smoochy-smooch with a female there. Arielle and Ashley were the ones that were most into it. We were pretty turned on at this dinner. Everybody's being touched. ...are out. Everyone's naked. Then me and Ashley, like, excuse ourselves to go to the bathroom. Oh, yeah, we just suddenly at the same time have to pee. Ari and Ashley. That is hilarious. I knew they would do something and it's like that. Hopefully, this isn't making Tom too too uncomfortable. Hell no, bro. This is really good food. They stopped eating their food because they were getting massaged or something. I was like, get a massage, like, all Tom wanted to talk about was the steak. He was like, "the steak is really great", I don't know if you guys are eating. This is just fascinating. It's medium-rare, I love it." I ate it all. Like, I loved it. There's this weird air about that house whenever all the lights are off and everyone's asleep, and you're the only one up. It's almost eerie. Jenny believed the house was haunted by someone named Fred. She was communicating with it. And I thought it was hilarious. If there's a spirit in the room, come touch my hand. Even downstairs, where all the producers were, apparently, there was something haunting downstairs too. 'Cause there were noises and, like, names being called, but there was nobody there. Are there any spirits in here? And I think everyone kind of sensed this weird presence in the house, and Jenny named the ghost. Frederick was just a name that came out of absolutely nowhere, like a lot of with me, out of my ass, purely. Can you make any of the lanterns move? That's weird. Oh, my God, that... Why did you move the one that no one can see? The producers had also named the ghost that they thought was there, and it was the same name. They were like, "Fred." This is weird. So I don't know. That's just them. I don't know. They're into the whole paranormal thing together. Do I think that there could've possibly been a ghost there named Fred? Yeah, it's totally possible. Arielle definitely tried to egg her on a little bit. She's like, "there's something here," you know. If there's somebody here... Please show yourself. What the? Oh, my God! I thought it'd be funny to, like, play with her. She didn't find it very funny at all. It wasn't it actually was one of my worst pranks. What's wrong with you? Oh, the... Oh, my God. What the...? You're such a g... You can't fool me. You cannot fool me. I'm a paranormal investigator... Extraordinaire. I know, I just love playing with you. Gosh! I saw you earlier. Do you want to come touch my hand? I see so much stuff, and I'm like, "Why did they... why'd they cut it right there? You're just about to show the good part." That house brought the worst and best out of us in many ways a lot of really bad things happened, a lot of bad characteristics were shown in everybody. Oh, my God. The house was disgusting. The house was filthy. Nobody cleaned anything. I think at one point Jenny actually had something growing in the living room. I mean, there was, like, fruit flies. There was one point in time where Arielle was cleaning out the sink 'cause it was clogged. And she was like, "what the hell is this?" And, like, she kept digging out this just matter. I actually... no one knows this... I threw up in that sink. I did. Oh, that could have been Tom's throw-up. We even had the, like, the producers, like, call and say, "look, you guys are cleaning the house today. This place looks like shit. Like, you need to clean the house." I think Jenny was definitely the grossest in the house. I know I've made some messes. I left, like, some molding, like, Mexican food in the front room. That is absolutely disgusting. Who ate burrito and chips and was over here sitting and -...left their salsa? -Most likely Jenny. It was Jenny. Jenny, you nasty. Francois, the tacos, the molding taco in the front room that I accidentally left there and left for, like, a few days. Oh, my God, I can smell it from here. -What is it? -Check this out. Oh, it's... that's Jenny's I felt like at some point everyone in the house thought that I never cleaned. No, you just might not have been watching when I cleaned. 'Cause I cleaned. I think Jenny cleaned all of three times in that house. But when she did, she did everything, and she made it very, very clear that everybody knew that she was cleaning. "I'm vacuuming now." She had the nerve to go around and take pictures of it when she cleaned the house. And we were like... "You cleaned up once. Kudos to you." Jenny dances like it's some sort of sport. This girl is a performer. She's, like, ballet and tap and spinning around and kicking her leg up. You're like, "oh, my God, give this girl space." I think dancing was just a way for us to get the crazy out. I love to dance. Like, that's how I get down. I've been dancing since I was, like... I don't know, I think I danced out of my mom's womb. I think I'm the best twerker. I got a lot of juice and meat to work with. Jenny's got more meat to throw around. You know, she's got something in the back to really make it move. -Here you go. -No, Jay, no. The Booty, not the hips. Put your hands on your knees and do it. Yeah, Jay! I think I'm pretty good for a white girl. I think I can twerk a little bit. Arielle couldn't twerk, so she had to go upside-down to twerk. So she twerked upside-down. There was a lot of twerking in the house though. Like, I-I-I can't do it. Like, my butt's not flabby, so I can't just shake it. I tried though. I got on my tippy toes. Get it, Tom. He ain't got no Booty though. He ain't got no Booty though. Nope. So one day Arielle took us to her voguing class. The vogue class was fun. I think the guys were the stars of the show. I don't really know what voguing is, other than, like, you move your arms and... I don't even know how to explain it, but it's, like, weird hand motions and, like, framing of the face. It... like, some just... Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft. It was not an amateur voguing class. These people knew how to vogue, and we're all sitting there looking like idiots. Look, I am not ashamed to say that I cannot hold my liquor. Oh, my God, she was such a sloppy drunk. It was great. And it doesn't take a lot for Arielle to get drunk. Like, two beers literally. Maybe two. Possibly two. And then from then on it's just blackness. Well, Bambi legs is the first indicator to a drunken night. When she would drink basically, she would just, like... her legs would give out on her. Like, she would be so wobbly and so, like, bubbly. She's very giddy. She's very like, "oh, my God, oh, my God, let's do that. Let's jump on the counter and dance, ha, ha, ha." The next thing I know is you hear this huge thud. And you just see... and I look over, and Arielle's not on the counter anymore. I don't wanna be the grown-up at all times. And I just can't hold my liquor. Shit... My name is almond milk. We had no music. We couldn't go there and turn the radio on and listen to a song. What we did was made up our own songs so we could sing. Sometimes out of boredom, creativity is born. Videotape this. Almond milk is my alter ego. She is by far the best rapper San Francisco's ever seen. Real World San Francisco Season 29 We say we won't drink tonight, but it happens every time. I'm almond milk. Ashley's Chestnut. Together we're two nuts. Chestnut's good to, like... Like, the, like, hype woman in the background. Jenny's the rapper. I'm just the one that stands there like this. My name is Chestnut. I don't got a gut. -Wow. -I got a big butt oh, God. I can't rap, come on. What y'all know about almond milk and Chestnut? The album drops may 2014. You already know. Yo, this is almond milk. And my favorite songs I like to sing are shakin' titties. Shakin' titties Shakin' titties, hey, hey Shakin' titties Hey, hey don't forget to shake your ass with it. That one was fun. I'm not even gonna lie. I wanna see your nipples Shakin' titties Pull that bra down and show the girls... We shake our titties. Shakin' titties. Who does not like to see a pair of titties shakin'. Salsa and cilantro, that was another one. That was... that was one of my favorites. Ci, ci, ci, cilantro. Hey now. Ci, cilantro in my salsa. I say what now... She was making food or something, and we were just... We just were bored, and I think it just all became a thing. Salsa and cilantro. Salsa and cilantro. And the onion And, and the tomato and, and, and and then, like, it slowly moved away from the kitchen into the, like, cell phone room or whatever. And by that point, I'm doing African dances. Salsa and cilantro. Salsa... it was just weird. It was just probably the best moment ever in the house though. Pepper, tomato, tomato... And pepper, and pepper... Okay, Jenny's birthday song for Brian, it was a sweet gesture. Can't actually sing happy birthday'cause it's copy... whatever. I had to write a new song. And I had to make sure I wrote it down for everyone so they wouldn't it up, because they had to memorize it 'cause it's a new song. And I had to make sure that everybody was on point. We were gonna just support Jenny, support Brian, that's it. None of us wanted to sing it. I don't even think Tom looked at what it was. Can't remember how the song went though. Brian! Brian, we're singing to you. Brian! Totally missed the action. What happened? I feel like Brian was probably more awkwarded out in the situation because we all started singing some random song to the dude. And he was just like, "what?" I was probably being a brat, you know? From us to you Happy Birthday. One year older it's true. One year older you grew. Now make a wish. Blow out the candles whoo! Whoo. -I wrote that song just for you. -Thank you, sir. Happy Birthday. I think everybody in the nation that watches this is obsessed with Jenny's boobs. You don't know how many times I get a day, "are those real or fake?" Ashley loved my boobs. She did. She did, but who couldn't? How could you not love my boobs? -I love my boobs. -She seduced me. It was those boobs, you know? Those fake boobs. It was... it was like a guy with money, but she just has the money on her chest. I'm just kidding. She was always grabbing Jenny's boobs or talking about Jenny's boobs or trying to see Jenny's boobs. Now we're halfway in. No, girl, we are not getting all the way naked. I am naked underneath this. You're not, so no. They're both, like, crazy, wild girls. I could see it being, like, you know, like, they get drunk one night and just being like... Like, it just, like, everybody's naked, they're going at it, and they wake up in the morning like, "what happened?" "I don't know. It was just weird." You're not gonna show that, are you? Girl... It was an innocent shower. We just wanted to gossip. Let me wash your boobies. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Okay, we both have boobs that are, "oh, my God." On blast. Oh. Oh, okay, confessional's over. Tom is very flatulent at all times. Did you fart, and I just walked into it? Yes. He'll just let it rip. I mean, he doesn't care. -What the hell is that? -Shot time, you, bro. I got you. No, the smell though. Tom. You cannot get away from it. It's bad. Excuse me. Tom passes gas on a regular basis, but Arielle blows up the bathroom. Like, I don't know why but my body, like, it's just... there's a dead person that lives inside there. Every time I go into a bathroom, he just comes out. Sometimes I went in there thinking somebody sold their ass to the devil. I thought people with smelly, you know, they're usually overweight because it's getting stuck in their intestines. 'Cause that's how I stay thin, is I everything out. That's good. Arielle blew up the bathroom every day, man. You couldn't... like, there was at least a 15-minute warning before and after. And I think at one point, like, one of the producers walked by and was like, "oh, my God. Who?" And they're like, "it's Arielle." He's like, "oh." I'm a shit. My name's Arielle, and I am a shit. Arielle is the best pranker ever. I've never seen anyone pull off a prank as well as Arielle. Dude shows up at our door. -Hello? -Sup, bro? Hey, I'm Kyle, the new roommate. He has the necklace on, the mic and everything, so I'm like, okay, I can see this. All the guys wanted, like, a hot chick. Okay, I won't complain if there's a hot chick who walks in the door and says, "I'm the new roommate. Cool, whatever." But there was this fat dude that walked up in here. So this is your roommate, Jenny. She's gonna be your roommate. Jenny, hey. He just comes in. He's putting his, like, finger in the peanut butter and just licking it. He's, like, flicking his boogers. Cory and I were playing pool. He walks by and just puts our pool balls into the pool holes, and we're like, "what the fuck is wrong with this kid?" Right? Bro, what the is wrong with you, bro? I mean, I feel like mtv chooses decent-looking people, you know? He... he basically was like, "oh, yeah, okay, so we just... You know, we're cool, we're big, we walk around without shirts," and just takes his shirt off. Sorry, it's just so hot. Had to be like this guy here. Ooh, the tee off, baby. You got the man boobs going. You know what I'm saying? Let those boys hang. Kyle went over-the-top and got everybody in that house sitting there scratching their head like, "holy. Maybe we shoulda actually stuck with Ashley." I think it was just perfect. Everything that he did... my... Like, I loved when he just started throwing her stuff out of their room. Just... just beautiful. Like, academy award, Kyle. I remember thinking, Cory's gonna beat the outta this kid, like, in five minutes. Just don't throw any punches. No, I'm just gonna drive his ass crazy so he leaves. I should have let it go on for a little bit longer, but, again, I didn't see any point in having my friend, like, get beat in the face. Before we take this shot, I have something to say. What, miss peacemaker? This is my good friend from Oakland. He doesn't actually live here. Cheers! Cory's passed out, and here's the thing. You cannot pass out with your shoes on. I learned that from King Bro Tom himself. So if you fall asleep with your shoes on, you're fair game to be with. So there were tampons. Light bulb. I think I eventually just noticed something on me, and I was like, "don't do that, stop." And then I saw them doing it to Cory, and I got pissed 'cause I was still kinda drunk. Tom got pissed off because we were messing with Cory 'cause it's his bro. Stream of tears. So we throw the tampons... like, we place them all over Cory, like on his pants and, like, on his face. Arielle... Good prankster, man. Cory was very easy to prank. He was very easy to scare. It's hilarious. If you catch him off-guard is when it's great. So basically there's a part in the aquarium where you can, like, touch, um, stingrays. So I go in, and I'm a little bit nervous 'cause, you know, it's a stingray and whatnot. He put his... he put his finger in to touch the stringray, and as soon as he touched the stingray I grabbed him, and he literally jumped. "Ahhh!" It's amazing. Yeah, when I scream, I scream like a girl. I think everyone saw it. I got scared, you know? It was like on the rock-a-boat or whatever that boat was that we went on. Oh, my God, the whole time, it was amazing. I want to see the gopro footage of that because he's in the front, and I want to see the footage of it 'cause I bet he's scared for his life. He prides him around like a macho man and whatever, but you know guys that are like that, they usually have a little soft spot inside, and he screams like a little girl. Here we go! Boat trip I got to hear Cory scream like a girl a lot when we did inner tubing. You know, what the girls are saying is that they would look back and they'd be like, "oh, no, stop, hold on." It was us like, "no, fuck!" I didn't know who was screaming. I couldn't hear myself screaming 'cause Cory was screaming like a girl. Tom's on this side screaming I'm in the middle holding on for dear life screaming like a little girl. The boat trip was amazing. They showed, like, 2.5 seconds of that, which sucked. Skinny-dipping, yeah, me and Jenny. You know, hey, we're on vacation. I'm so lucky because of this. Let me... We're out here in the wild. You know, no one's around. It's like, let's be Adam and Eve. Let's take this stuff off. Let's take it to the next level. You know, so... We got naked, got one with nature. Well, we got off camera. You guys know what that means. But... They were Adam and Eve. Like, I'm sure they were just like, "let's restart the planet." Like, it was... I'm sure that's what was going on up there. I gotta do it Adam and Eve style. America, I have no problem with being naked. I'm not... no shame in my game. Are you guys gonna show folsom street fair? I don't think they had any idea what was in for them at the folsom street fair. The guys loved 'em. They were getting a lot of attention in the bear suits. I guess it's some kind of gay symbol actually, and the guys didn't realize it, so guys were coming up to them, like, presenting themselves to them, and they never put two and two together. A lot of guys walked up to Cory and were like, "let me see your... Let me see the bear." The guys handled... handled folsom street fair pretty well. You could tell they were uncomfortable. They had the kind of nervous smiles. Like, just, you know, like, "yes, like, I like fur too." We were a hit. Like, I've never, like, taken so many pictures with people. Like, literally we would just walk and everybody, "can we take a picture? Can we take a picture?" It was a leather party, and we wore furry bear outfits, but it worked. The guys, they wore the bear suits and the wolf suit. That left me with nothing. I will serve and protect. Okay? My socks. They do come up to the middle... Brian basically walked around naked. Little tighty-whiteys and a blazer. And one of the funniest times ever was him on the bus. He's like, "uh, I'm sorry." Standing in front of these three old women with his, like, his junk straight out. Like, you can see his..., but I guess behind whatever boxers he's wearing. And he's, like, literally sitting there with his... in these women's faces, and we're all just sitting there dying. Yeah, yeah. I remember a moment on the bus, I was trying to figure out a place to stand, and my genitals happened to just be right in everybody's face, you know? But so some guy finally got up and let him sit down, because it was just that awkward. He was bouncing around in tighty-whiteys. Welcome to San Francisco. Hannah is my best friend. She's my ride-or-die bitch. Oh, my God. Don't let me go. This is Hannah. -Tom. -What's up, Hannah? It's nice to finally meet you. Cory, Hannah. It's nice to meet you. I remember her, like, walking right up to Jamie and me looking at Tom and just going like, "six." We had a... seven. -You changing now? -Yep. I'm gonna stick with my first one. She's not a 6.5. I don't know why the they said that. They're crazy. They are not one to talk either. They've no room to talk. 6.5 my ass. She had already, like, seen pictures of Cory, so she already had her eye on him. She was just like, "okay, I see you." So as soon as she got into the house, her and Cory hit it off immediately. Definitely there was an attraction there. I know... I mean, I heard that they made out a couple times. Apparently rumors were going around that they slept together, but I know that didn't happen because I went and blocked them because they were trying to do it on my bed. Whoa, not in my room, no. Your bed. No. No, get out of my bed. Sorry, sorry, dude. No, no, Hannah! Jamie comes in, "uh-uh, nuh-uh, get out of my room! I am not having you guys on my bed. Uh-uh, that's not happening." I'm like, "Jamie, come on, take one for the team." Like... like, "come on, man, help me out, help me out." And, uh, yeah, so she c.B.'Ed on that one definitely. Apparently some bow-chicka-wow-wow happened in the confessional. I don't know... I'm not gonna say because I don't know exactly what happened. I just know they made out. Get him. Deeper. Get him, Jamie, get him. Get him. Please show that. Tom got the biggest atomic wedgie I've ever seen in my life, and he doesn't remember it. I was the one that started the wedgie with Tom, but I was making it an innocent little like, "oh, wake up." You know, "I'm gonna pull your boxers up." That has to hurt, babe. Don't you call me "babe." And secondly, it doesn't hurt. Turns out to be something like, "oh, I can't feel it," 'cause competition between me and Tom is ridiculous all the time. Basically me and Hannah were like, "all right, you're gonna feel this." She takes the loop from the bottom all the way to the waistband, and we just make it like little handles on either side. And we pick him up off the bed from either side. She takes one side, I take the other, and we just rip. The camera guy, like, panicked. He looked at it and was radioing in like, "do I tape this? Do I not tape this? What do I do? What am I... do I... I don't wanna look at this. What am I supposed... what's happening?" And the next morning, let me tell you what, I felt it. I had burns in the butt cheeks and everything. The next morning, he comes up to me and he's like, "Jamie, what happened?" And I was like, "what are you talking about?" And he was like, "my butthole hurts so bad." He had no clue, but he knew his butt hurt. Wait, I have to put it back. Let's go, let's go. Honestly, I think the camera... I think production crew, I think the crew loved us. Give me that! Mic me! One of the boom guys was recording me and Cory's conversation and swung the mic. Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink. And that's all you hear, man. And we just turned and we started laughing at him. Pfft. That was on me. And he was gone for the next couple days, and we were like, "they fired him. They got rid of him for breaking our bottles." Smashed a whole bunch of glass. Talk about it now. Yes. Yes. Yes. Get close up on his face. You get to know these people almost even though it's almost like a non-verbal relationship. Because they can't really talk to you, but they kind of laugh at things you do. I saw Jackson's mother bench more than you, bro. That's a disrespect to his mom. No, that's not disrespectful that's disrespectful towards his mom. That was a mama joke. One of them put a plane... Like, held a plane in front of the camera and was going like this with the camera with the plane in front of it. And then I remember Brian put the wolf hat on top. They really loosened up towards the end. In the beginning, I mean, everyone's kind of, you know, like, "who are you? Who are you? This is my job," you know? It's just weird because these people, they're going through everything with you, but at the same time they're not with you, you know? They can't give their input or say their opinions. They're just there to observe. I mean, I consider myself metrosexual. And then I look at Cory and Jay G., and I think they're, like, a lot worse than I am. All the guys were a little Metro in the house. They wanted to make sure that they looked nice, which isn't surprising. I mean, I think... I think guys should care about their appearance. These guys are kinda girly, yeah. I mean, they liked to look nice, which is a good thing. I guess women like hairless bodies, which is weird to me. He had hair, like, a couple hairs on his back that just annoyed the outta me. So I got my pluckers and took care of that. I know Brian likes to, like, shave his whole body, but I don't know about the other guys. I think that... I think Cory likes to shave his body. Think Brian shaves his legs, which is kinda weird to me. Wow, yo, I didn't even think about that. I always saw a bare, like, clean, like, baby skin on Cory and Brian. Cool, all right. So shaving my body is... That's familiar in the fitness world. Like, you're not gonna go onstage with a hairy body. Brian does take his time when it comes to doing his hair. It was just like, he'd straddle and then he'd just do this. 20, 30 minutes. You know, just, like, playing. And it's just like, "dude, you look the same." Like, "nothing has changed." Like, his hair looked like... Like a Ken doll's hair. Like, hard. Seriously, hard. I was trying to rock this new Jheri curl look, and, like, it wasn't working. I couldn't get it right. It was like, at first, okay, you know, sometimes I had good days, but most of them were bad. Everyone has an O.C.D. Thing, everyone... everyone has their thing. Mine is socks. I'm a total sock freak. Really? I have, like, 300 pairs of socks with me. Jay had a very particular thing about his socks. He put his socks in a certain way in the drawer. No, no, no, no, no, no! You can have your sock back. Give me... Give... Leave my socks out of it. So I have certain socks for the gym. I have certain socks just for laying around the house. I have certain socks if I'm going out. He has a thing with socks. He would call me out when I wasn't wearing matching socks. Like, me and Jenna both would walk around without matching socks. I don't... maybe an O.C.D. thing. Tom has an interesting sock collection. I don't wear colored socks. Tom probably has, like, the weirdest, strangest style I've ever seen. But, like, his sock and underwear collection is impeccable. He would match every color with a different color. In essence, it never matched. Nothing matching. That's fine. The hat and the shirt. The what? The hat and the shirt, the print. No. The, uh, shoes and the socks. Not really. Are you kidding me? Are you blind? No. They seem in their natural element just constantly primping in the one mirror that we had in the house. I think that they cared more about their appearance than the girls did, to be honest. Ah, not about that life. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! The competition, the competitiveness sprouted directly from Tom. I know this because he's the most competitive person in the entire world. Every pool game, we were serious. Every shuffleboard game, we were serious. The champ! The champ is here! Let's go! Look at Tom. I'm getting out of the way. I'm getting out of the way from this. This bitch. Tom is like... he lives for competing it seems like. It's just that's his nature. Oh, my God! Tom, you need to chill. -Give me my thing back then. -No, you threw it at me. He threw the puck at me, and I was like, " you for throwing that puck at me." And he was like, " you for being a bitch." And I was like, "I'm gonna break up with you now." You're gonna rewatch it, and I went... No, you straight up... I threw it at the puck. Okay. Oh, my God. -Jamie. -No. Anyways. Jamie! Anyways! Either way, if he wins or loses, he's not gonna shut up about it, and he's a sore winner and a sore loser. Tom would be the first one to ask to do a staring contest. "Let's do a word search. Who can get the first word search done?" You know, like, "let's play shuffleboard. Whoever wins best out of three." I've never really been around people who were just so competitive about that didn't matter. Like, if you were better at pool or better at staring at someone in the eye for too long. Like, "my eyes can get dry before your eyes, and I won't blink." Staring contest, go. Staring contest, go. Ow. See, that's stupid to me. I have not lost yet! I will never lose in a staring contest with anybody. I guess people don't like me winning. Where's the... where's the at? The food store was out of chicken nuggets. Yeah, I just want to say that. They didn't have... No, they're out. Jenna doesn't like to eat anything. -She likes... -Chicken nuggets. That was her thing. Milk and chicken nuggets. She literally only likes chicken nuggets. Jenna doesn't eat. She does not eat anything. You and your chicken nuggets. I know. Yeah. I remember we were out at the bar, and she asked for macaroni basically without the cheese. And they came and were like, "here's your macaroni with... It's just macaroni." "Could I get macaroni and cheese with no cheese, please?" What the...? What? What is that? They said macaroni and cheese without the cheese for some reason. No, it's pasta with butter. They'd never heard of that before. I don't understand. It's just pasta with butter. See? See, I tried something new, and I liked it. Yay! You gotta trust me. Yeah. Oh, that's pretty good. You like that? We tried to get Jenna to eat a lot of stuff. And to her credit she ate some of the stuff. Like, she gave it a try. And I got a hot dog, and I'm loving it. How'd you get a hot dog? I want all the food in the house. Dude, I got the hot dog on lockdown. I got the hot dog on lockdown. I'm a hungry girl. I like to eat. Like, I got some meat. I got some thickness to me. I like to eat. So if I'm looking for that person, it's taking me a while, I might need to stop for a little break. I am so impressed by her ability to bring out fully dressed food out of her bags. Like a burger. Or like a hot dog. Or a sandwich. Like, "where'd you get that?" Da-ding! Like, and hot dog. Da-ding. And hamburger. Like, how does it even, like, keep its form in your bag? It's... I'm impressed by it too. It's my way of trying to keep my girlish figure. I would try to eat half of everything, so then I'd put the other half in a place where I could eat it later. Yeah, um, you gotta always be prepared. Times are hard and you get hungry, she's prepared and I'm not. I don't have a taco in my purse, and then I see hers, and I get jealous and wish that I thought ahead. You never know what you'll find in my purse. See what else we got. It was just frustrating because the whole time I'm like, "oh, my God, San Francisco's so loving, and we're such giving people, and yay! Rainbows, butterflies, candy." It wasn't any of that at all, so... Mtv. Bull... Okay, that didn't happen. I wasn't expecting as much hate as we got. I was expecting a little bit more, like... I guess friendliness, but, hey. People in cars would just drive next to us and just yell stupid. People would run in between us and, like, do circles around us and scream, like as if they were gonna get on camera. Whoa. Which guy said that? Just going to bars and whatnot, people did not like us. They were not nice. And I had people pouring drinks on me. My, like, third night in the house, I had some dude pour his whole drink. I had to throw my white pants away. I will never wear white pants again because of that. Cory got pissed at a different kid, not the kid that threw the cranberry juice and you can see that on video. Like, he grabs one kid and starts shoving him, but it wasn't the kid that threw the cranberry juice on him. My room was the closest to the front door, my bed was, and so I heard everything from girls giving their Twitter handle shoutouts to, you know, asking mtv to put them in the show, to people cussing us out and telling us to go home. Ashley! People were, like, shouting, "fuck The Real World!" Like, stupid. We had some people come by the house and, like, they're yelling and yapping off at the mouth late night. And I guess they burned our, um, intercom. Holy. See, I wasn't kidding. Oh, yeah, they're... They melted it, dog. They burned... It's melted. There was a situation where the whole cast pretty much was, like, arguing with this group of people outside the gate, and somebody spit on Tom through the gate. Doesn't matter if she did, bitch. Whoop your ass! No, you wouldn't. Hey, you too, punk! Oh, yeah, get it. Get some glasses. I run over there, and I didn't even look at who did it. I just got the biggest loogie I could and just spit on all of them. No, no, no, no. Not worth it. Not worth it. I'm closing the doors, go. Let's go. Go, go. I don't know how she gets that much saliva in her mouth at that time, but just starts spitting, like "da-da-Dee-Dee-Dee" all... Through the gate, all across these people. Jenny was like, "oh, hell no." Like, "don't spit at us." And so she came running through to the kitchen and grabbed cleaning product. "Jenny... " The phone rings. "Jenny, put the cleaner down. Do not spray the strangers with the cleaner." My bad. She said put the spray and down. You're egging that doesn't need to be egged on. There's nothing egging. -There's nobody here to egg. -I'm spraying them in the face. I'm gonna leave it right here. That is my protection. Here you go, baby. You're crazy. On Lauren's last night, we went to the highest peak in San Francisco, um, to see the entire city, all the lights. It was amazing. It was beautiful. And there was a raccoon that approached us. Right. Non-existent... Yo, buddy. Come here. He's right there. He is adorable. Let him... let him crawl... There you go. You're pretty. Hello. My name is Amber, the raccoon whisperer. He walked up and just sat down and was, like, looking up like, "yo, what's up, guys?" So people started feeding him, and he, like, hung out. And we decided that his name is Francisco. Francisco the raccoon after San Francisco. Francisco the raccoon, he was, like, the friendliest raccoon I've ever met in my I didn't know raccoons were domesticated like that. I even drew a picture of him and hung it up on the wall in our house by the computer and called him our 13th roommate. Francisco came to me on a lovely San Francisco evening. I don't know why. Out of where? Nowhere. But he came up to me and he was, like, talking to me. And I could hear him. I understood what he was... We had a conversation. I brought him some beef jerky. We had a good time. I didn't know raccoons liked beef jerky. That was a great lesson. Cory's got fake boobies! Cory's got fake boobies! They... they put something in the air. Like, there's something when you get in that house, like it causes you to be crazy. I swear, like, it sounds so stupid, but it's so true. What? What? You know. No! We... we came on this show. We knew we were gonna act a fool at one point in time on this show. And it's our time to let loose and just have this full experience and not just half-ass it. Ladies. Hey, hey, hey. I don't care what people think. We had a great time out there. Us roommates know what went on. We know what we said, what we went through. That's... that's all I care about. Real World San Francisco!
