Hurray! - What a magnificent city Rome! - And what a dream this sun is! - Have it in Milan! - San Pietro is magnificent! But the Milan Cathedral is more impressive. Too bad we only have two days! Seeing Rome in two days is not enough, two months would not be enough for us! Just run, bus after bus. I divided the city into sectors, after the Vatican, one hill after another we will see all seven of them in a short time. - Without stopping? - Are you already affected by the air of Rome? - You're getting two lazy! - Give me a sandwich, I'm hungry! You know sandwiches are rationed! Just a "tear" and we are ruined. You won't want to sleep outside tonight! We have the money! Two days in Rome! They will all die of anger! For two days I don't want to hear about work and Milan. It will be the air of Rome, but I feel different. - Where do we go now? - At the Trevi Fountain. - Three sous in the fountain. - Then we'll be back! - Maybe on their honeymoon! - Wait a moment. - Now we ask. Hey, say! - $ ì? Excuse me, for the Trevi Fountain? Trevi Fountain? It's difficult! How do you get there from here? Excuse me, is this the Appia Antica? - Tomb of Cecilia Metella? - It's right near here. - Sorry ... - Hey, I can't split up! Ask someone else! Don't you see what I have to do? I'll take you there. I have to go to Sora Metella too. - Tell us where this fountain is? - But look at that girl! Get "loaded" by a "taxi driver"! I'm talking to two foreigners! We want to go? We happened just fine! The usual Romans. What a way to do it! Let's hope that not all Romans are like that. - Let's go? - Let's go. - We got off to a good start! - We are not discouraged. - Ask this. - It's useless. - No, try. Excuse me. Please, Trevi Fountain. - It's in the center. - Okay, but what is the way to go? ... Ninetto il Moro restaurant. Ninetto il Moro? The one from Testaccio? ...came. I spend my days, my nights there! Ninetto is a friend, a relative, a brother! Make the best rigatoni with pajata from Rome! - I'll take you there. - But the Trevi Fountain? But what are you going to do there? Come to Ninetto and make yourself a "tycoon"! It has an "amatriciana" and a wine that goes down without you noticing! Let's go. A day like this will remember her for a lifetime. - This then! - We got it wrong again. In Rome, to be heard, one must be recommended or a foreigner. - Let's contact a policeman. - Where do you find him? - We are not in Milan! - Then what do you want to do? What do I want to do? Now you will see it! Scusi? Tell me? - "Pardon", information. - I'm at your disposal. I'm available. - Trevi Fountain. - Very good! I'll explain it to you right away. Too bad I have the car under repair. Bad, do you understand? - No matter. - No, it's important. Trevi Fountain is far away, it takes us two minutes by car. Now I'll explain well. Are you alone in Italy? Yes, beautiful sun of Italy. No sun! I meant it with mom and dad. - Stop that! - No mom and dad, we alone. We camping. Turn world hitchhiking. - I get it. - Beautiful capital of Italy. Yes, but to see it well you need a car, a guide ... - I am a guide. - What he said? With the car today see all of Rome! invite you. In two hours the car will be ready. Fault fixed. Ya! The three of us, you ... "walk." No, I have two friends ... Due "camarad". "Ya, camarad". Two guys ... two gentlemen, huh? One is ... "doctor". Another is like me ... possident. It has the "grain". We could meet in two hours at the Colosseum. Sudden machine failure. Of course, Commander, you are right. I could have phoned earlier, but ... In this area the phones ... it's Easter, everything is closed. Where did I find him? What does he say? Renounce? But Commander, you ... you have to come to Rocca Morbella for a year. My brother has already warned everyone of the honor she did us. I beg you, Commander, don't make me look bad. But, no, I assure you, only 5 minutes. At 3.30 at the Colosseum. I got it? - At the 'trois "and a half! - Ya! Ya! Until we meet again. Until we meet again. Ciao. Have you seen how the system works? Ciao! In short, where is this Trevi Fountain? Ah, yes! - Then? - I'll check the work and give it to him. - Aren't we done yet? - Osvaldo, I want to check. - But I finished it all ... - Hurry up! With these "bagnarole" you have to be careful. I told her that he was incompetent. She could do it. The responsibility is mine, I do the work with conscience. Do you no longer trust your pupil now? If I don't check, I'm not comfortable. It is a question of conscience. It takes me a minute. Hurry up! But ... what is he doing? - Hey! - Criminal, you want me to close the shop? Down here it was all a mess! In short, what happens? Light a candle in Sant'Antonio. After less than three kilometers he would have found himself "grunted" - and pale in the hospital. - For that vine? Lives? Here it takes a lot of original spare parts! But don't worry, it will be ready on Tuesday. Tuesday? Day after tomorrow? And does he tell me so? Do I have to tell him while crying? I don't make the original parts myself. I need it now! I have to take my office manager to Rocca Morbella! With this he did not even reach Rocca Cannuccia! This is true unconsciousness! She doesn't know who I am! I will speak to the right person. Hey, calm down. Is it reckless not to send her away with a broken car? To accompany the office manager, he can take a rented car. Already! And where do I find a rental car? Now, here? It is better to wear the "parannanza" than the tailcoat! Hurry, I want to close. Okay ... I'm going. But remember, I'll be here on Tuesday and you'll be dealing with me. Doctor Anselmo Gerardi Frezza, official of the State General Accounting Office. We will do the math! We're OK! I have to deal with that Eternal Father. Osvaldo, put all those pieces back. No, you do it yourself, you gave me a "grant" slap. - You go down there. - But you don't understand. I did everything to keep my car. The job was perfect, it was just a joke. Minus the slap! I have remedied three foreigners who "bother" you. I have an appointment with them in two hours with the car. What an Easter, Osvaldo! - Are you going there alone? - No, now I'm going to Sergio and Franco. - Do I really make you sick? - What are you saying, little brother? You have to grow a little tall for these things. - You're still a little too rookie. - Ah! - And how do you do with Magda your? - Yeah, how do I do it? Osvaldo ... will you do me a favor? No! I'm not a rookie anymore! You take care of that one! Okay, I'll call you. Meanwhile, put the pieces back together, slug! > Ask a brother a favor! How clever! - Good morning, Sora Agnese, happy Easter. - Thanks. - Is Sergio at home? - No, we work harder on holidays. - He's over there, fixing the eggs. - Sergio! There are the guards, the carabinieri, the scientific police ... fingerprints. When it comes to stealing, they take off your pants without touching your "belly"! I have a bite to eat and come to the workshop. If you can't find me, wait for me, I have to go to Magda. - Because? - I promised to spend Easter with her and ... Imagine it will happen. Make up an excuse. Tell her relatives have arrived from the south. That screen from uncle Gaetano arrived at us. - Did you read the paper this morning? - At least stay calm for Easter. If something is stolen from your master, I wouldn't mind. Bad, bad! You too are a capitalist and you have to defend the "pocket". I know the Mastelloni counts well, I have been their trusted man for 20 years. With everything they have ... watch out for the penny! Gaetano, that's why they should give him everything! The Mastelloni Counts can deceive you, not me! No, the money deserves it. Michele, come on, the pasta is overcooking. - Pinuccia, hurry up. Close and come upstairs. Meanwhile, the accounts have left. The husband on one side and the wife on the other. When I think of the villa I left alone, my blood freezes. Don't worry, nobody steals it from you! You will understand, after 20 years it is the first time that I have left her alone. You have to believe me, dear brother, I don't feel comfortable at all. You call Franco, right? No! You have to go and get it that doesn't come off the mother! That is fine. What do you want? Sandro ... but with those ... is it combined? And you ask me? Those are foreign! Another mentality, evolved, sporty. - Sergio, they are Nordic! - Ah! Sor Vincenzo, can you give me a token? I have to call. You too when I have to close! Will I have the right to go home once a year too? > It takes me two minutes, I also have to go home to eat. I know your "two minutes" well! - Here, but hurry. - That is fine. Hurry, I want to close. If God wills, tomorrow I'm going to Tuscolo to eat the fettuccine! And after a bottle of coffee made with my own hands! We close. - Ah! - I'll take the scooter, I have to run an errand. Now? Your mom said it's ready. Forget it. - Dad, five minutes, I'll come and go. - That is fine. - Dad, the week? - You already weighed it. - Next, right? - Is it possible that you are always asking for money? But I work, dad. I go and come back. - Hi Dad. - "Shut up your" ... this boy! Hurry up, please me. And then you say you love me? You know chocolate is bad for me. It gives me patches on my face and pimples behind my shoulders. I'm allergic to chocolate and you keep sending me chocolate! Tons of chocolate! You're a monster! It was just a little egg to remember the tradition. But you will see that I will be able to make me forgive immediately. Do you know where i am? From the florist! Luckily, I love flowers. Rosetta! Throw out this filth! Rosetta! Rosetta! Like? No, don't come, please. At least on Easter day spare me your sight! Mamma mia, how boring you are! I don't want to see you today! - Throw that egg away. - Throw it away? - Yup. And close the door. This egg is worth a month's salary. She's crazy as hell! Frank! Frank! Franco! - Come down, I need to talk to you. - At this time? You're crazy? - Get off! - Because? - Females! - Then? Move! Three foreigners, three "big fans." - And are they there? - Of course. How much money do you have? - I get them from mom and go downstairs. - Hurry up. - You take! I want to send this to my grandmother in Gallarate. She will be happy to know that I spent Easter in Rome. This will make my colleagues at the printing house die of rage. Why are you so bad? At least at Easter we are at peace with everyone. You're right. I will send this postcard to Carlo: Ara della Pace. No, send this to Carlo: 'I love so. I love you just like that. " Poor thing, he was about to end up under the train to greet you. I wouldn't treat him like that, he's full of money. Trouble is, the only good thing he has is money. I am only waiting for love. Come and see! If they saw us in Milan! - You look like a hot air balloon! - You're ridiculous! Who played? - Is the lady there? - It's in its usual place, in the alcove. - I'd marry you! - I don't have the kit ready yet! - But you are "equipped"! - Hands off, I'm an honored girl! - Sandro. - Hi, Magda. My love, how come? I was expecting you later. I know, I know ... but you see So you say hello to me? Won't you give me a kiss? - Look, nock, I'm out of my mind. - What is it, dear? I just didn't expect it. - Relatives arrived from the "heel". - What does it mean? They came from Puglia. Relatives of my mother. It means goodbye Easter! - We have to postpone the trip. - He didn't want to! Patience. Yeah, you don't care! Once we could be together from morning to night! I've always said: "Snake relatives". Do not be a child. For once, you'll make your mother happy. Holy shit! You have to believe me, I only do it for her! - Just for her! - We must resist the blows of fate. But this Trevi Fountain? Do you care so much about throwing the pennies to return? They just do it to take our money away. What are you doing today? I don't know ... nothing. Maybe I'll go to the cinema. I knew! At Easter, with crowded cinemas, she goes alone! Honey, how much I like you when you're jealous. - I'll stay home, okay? - I do not believe it. I swear to you, I'll be in bed all day with the phone next to me. My soul, you know I have only you. You don't have to get angry, I call you every half hour. If you don't answer me before the third ring ... I come here and do a slaughter! And ... and I don't even save Rosetta! Exaggerated. But ... what does Rosetta have to do with it? Well ... so ... I hit! I don't care who I get. If you don't call me ... woe to you! I go. Oh! - What are you doing? - My feet hurt. Now I understand why it is the city of 7 hills! With all these climbs! I don't want to walk anymore! Be careful! Rome is beautiful, but I am tired. We have come a long way! Luckily we got a car with the driver. - Which car? - Have you forgotten the young man from this morning? But would you like to go there? Of course! my feet have become two irons. What if some bad guys show up? I do not like him. - But he's a nice hunk. - Here, now it begins. She dreams of prince charming! You don't have to marry him, you know? What does that have to do with anything? It's not nice to hang out with people we don't know. And then we said we are foreigners. Now, how do we do it? - We'll tell him the truth. - Good! No! They are crazy about foreigners. If we tell them we're Milanese, they'll kill us. Yes you are right. Let's keep playing foreigners, it's more fun ... and you will see that they will treat us all with more kindness. What will we be? French, English ... Let me make the change. You know what great fun gesturing! Well, everyone in Italy knows French and English a little. We need to find a more difficult country. I don't know ... Sweden, Norway. - Holland! - Denmark! - How does my handsome Dane look to you? - Very convincing. But look at these, they are not seen! All these foreigners like that. "Yes, mercie, ourevoir ..." and then they don't show up again. Maybe they gave you a rip off. Foreign, cute ... and three beautiful all together ... When does another opportunity like this happen to us? We have been waiting for half an hour, will they have understood the appointment correctly? Wow, he's in the Colosseum! What if they got it wrong and went to the Phanteon? They are not Roman, foreigners know Rome better than we do. - By the way, did you tell him the car is ours? - Of course! I couldn't tell him I had screwed her. I also said that I have a supergarage, that you are a landowner and you a doctor. Remember that, huh? Maybe it's better that they don't come. They do not come? And who are those? Hey! Sergio! Sergio, you are a phenomenon, you have picked up the best ones. "Senorita, mademoiselle, fraulein, froken"! Plan, you've already used half a dictionary, then what do you tell him? - Good morning. - Bonjour. - Good morning. These are my friends. I am Sandro, he is Sergio and Franco. I Nanden, this llse, this Margaret. Delighted. Colosseum? Let's go. - Come on. - "Venghino", you don't pay a penny anyway. Sandro, kill that "deaf cat" you are! - Colosseo, beautiful! - Ya! Bello.

Instead of speaking languages ​​he screams in Italian! - What are you saying? - Sergio ... have you gone stupid? Look at them. To avoid arguments, the blonde ... All right, I'll take the brunette. Always leave the lowest one to me. Great Colosseum, very magnificent. - Well, you speak Italian. - We speak little Italian. I studied grammar. - I don't want you to get the blonde! - Go behind, rude.

Laugh Laugh. - Hello, Sandro? - Not at all Sandro! It's still you! Like? Sandro? He's my brother, isn't he? Did I never tell you that I have a brother named Sandro? - But yeah, don't you remember? - Let's have dinner together? At dinner? It's not possible, I have a terrible headache. - Does it hurt so much? - I haven't touched any food, I don't want to see anyone. See you tomorrow, maybe. Hi dear. Hello. Miss, I brought you something to eat. Take it all away, I'm not hungry. I do not want to eat. - Thing? Don't want to eat? - I'm not hungry, I tell you. I don't understand, the Commendatore satisfies her in everything and she wastes time with that starving man! Rosetta, please! This is my business. All right, when he's hungry he'll eat. - But look! - But they're cute, huh? There is nothing to say, they are different from the Italian ones. They have more spirit, more resourcefulness, more ... More appetite. These in Denmark do not eat. They are Nordic, with the cold it is there you have to eat little. These, for dinner, must be taken to the General Markets. I think it works! I can't take it anymore, I'm dying of laughing! Careful, they look at us. Leave it to me, I'm having a blast. To drink? Orzata. Drink? Martini! Martini cocktail.

( We accompany you to the hotel to change. You have understood? DANCES tonight, understand? Champagne. You like it? - Champagne! - What hotel are you staying at? - Grand Hotel. - Tonight to dance NIGHTCLEBBE! - What a mess, tonight they will come here! - How do we do it? - Do you wish? - We were wrong. - Please, is there an exit? - Here. - Thanks. Guys, we have to go change and fix a bit of "grain". With those it takes a lot of money! Souvenirs, martinis, gasoline! Tonight you will notice! But those have a lot of money! The father of mine has trees, forests ... Is it mine then? It has six or seven opera houses. We can't look bad, we have to find the grain. - And how do we do that? - It's simple, we are not orphans. Yeah, but they eat and drink and get fat and dad pays the bill. - But when do we get "to the point"? - Tonight let's take them "To the Caves". They dance, squeeze, make them drink a little ... They're foreigners, aren't they? But who knows if Margaret fits. The usual fool. As soon as he likes a woman, he makes her a saint. - It? - I wasn't born yesterday, you were dying on him. It is already cooked. Never show that you are in love or you ruin yourself with your own hands. But you like that curvy "babe", huh? Of course I like it, but I don't cook! - For me, women are made for fun and that's it. - Do you feel it? - Let's work to "unbolt" them. - Unbolt them? - We have to find the grain. Foreign, rich and bone! - Vamos! My poor feet, what weariness! - How are you doing tonight? - This evening? - Too bad, you won't be able to come with us. - Where is it? To bed? - Finally home. - For real. Lady, the dress! It's late, I have the show at eight! That is fine! That is fine! Miss Pia, when do you stop? - (Oh, there they are! Good evening. - {TOGETHER) Good evening. - Did you have fun? - Yes. - Tired? - Yes No. The client vacated the room an hour ago. Tonight Terni sings in the "Nabucco" choir. I had my bags brought in. There they are. Please. This is the room. I had a cot added, so there can be three of you. Look at the sheets! Fresh from the laundry! - For me, cleanliness is everything! That wall is a national monument. It is from Trajan, the emperor. - Beautiful. - You've studied it, haven't you? Beyond is all of Rome. If there was a hole in the wall, you would see the Altar of the Fatherland. Here are your documents. Oh, my feet! What a beautiful "tuse". - Are you from Milan too? Pure blood Milanese! Of the carron of Milanzone! But look what a combination! Who gave you the name of my pension? - Viraghi. - The accountant Viraghi! The one who came here with Miriam, "the playmaker". This is an artists' house, a serious house! Everyone comes here, especially the Milanese. Milan! Milan! I haven't seen it for 20 years! - It's changed? - Actually, 20 years ago we weren't in Milan yet! What a fool! You are so young! I too was young like you when I came here from Milan. Young, beautiful and courted. Do you know what took me away from Milan? The art. I sang. I was breathless ... and a body that was a marvel. A silhouette ... As I used to do the scugnizza, nobody did it! Well ... maybe Reggini. And the men! All at my feet, all! Does this iron come or does it not? A bit of patience! Every time I have to iron you must apply on stamped paper! But what to do with the ironed dress ... if to earn two sous ... must he take it off? - Long last! - Well, that's enough. - What a talker! He was about to tell us the details of his honeymoon. What do you have? You seem like a dying woman. What do I have? I'm not standing, I'm dead tired. How soon you two get tired! I feel fresh as a rose. We would have fun tonight. Resign yourself, we can't go dressed like that. Who knows how elegant they will be, with all the money they have! - What a pity! - But you didn't want to see them today! - Because I didn't know them. - The handsome Franco has made a breakthrough. Stupid. Do you know what I tell you? Now I take off my clothes. I really don't care about mine. My feet are swollen. Are you crazy? Our schedule must be respected. Rome by night with illuminated monuments. I don't care! I came to Rome to have fun. Not for jogging. - (Come on, take a seat.> {IN MILANESE) Come, madam. Excuse me ... variety people, dancers. They have a lot of demands and then, when you have to pay the bill, they say they did bad business. And instead of the money, they leave me suitcases and trunks. You know ...! I have a lot of clothes and a lot of stuff over there to open a shop. For real! - Clothes? - Lots! Even in the evening? Mom, why can't you ever find socks in this house? You're right, I left them on the terrace to dry. - Go see if they're dry. - Let me eat, they're wet. - I knew! Now what do I wear? - If you told me, I washed them. Just think about eating! I only have two pairs of socks. One I put it on and the other I take it off. But what if one doesn't dry out? - I'm screwed! - No need to scream! - Here we all feel! - I know, we're all fake dumb here, huh? This is not a slap, it is a "tram"! My poor creature, you slap him! You love only the daughter, what a kind of father! > Now you take them too! Come to your mother who loves you. Don't cry, mother's heart, that is not a father, he is a beast. I can put on yesterday's socks, but I need some money. - What are you doing with the money? - I have my life, right? Beautiful son, spend like the Aga Khan. I gave you 2,000 lire the other day. Ah! How it burns! - Okay, don't cry. It passes you, it passes you. - Oh yes? - How much you need? - I'm going with Franco, that's a young gentleman. - He always has 10,000 lire in his pocket. - 10 thousand lire? It's Easter, mom. These are the last! Miss, but when do you stop? Where are you going tonight? - At the night club. - Am I really that bone? Three flowers of the northern fjords that blossomed in the sun of Rome. Beautiful! Where did you read it? This is mine, idiot. Authentic. Where is the eau de cologne? Yours is over and mine with the cabbage that I give it to you! And ... will you combine tonight? Combine ... with this keg? My tie! - Unfortunate! Ugly son ... - Stop it! - Buy ties instead of wasting your money! - Stand still! > Don't say impossible things. > Of course, if instead of a boy I had had a girl ... - Here's my Franco. - Hello. - Hi dear. - He became a man. - Let me see U. - Mom! A lot has changed since the last time! - Sure, it was 10 years ago! - Franco! - What character! - Good evening, lady. - Take something? - No, I'll run away. - Where are you going? - I'm busy. - You don't have to be late at night. - But I never go out! - Please, Mom, I have a commitment. - Let him go. - Love at your age is important. - The love? Franco doesn't think about these things, does he? - Franco, you can tell us. - Leave him to his secrets. - He thinks about studying, he doesn't think about love. - What love! I have to accompany some people from Copenhagen to the city. Ah! My Franco looks like a big boy, but he is still a child. - If he's not having fun now ... - He's reached an age ... You're right, hers is an ungrateful age. Excuse me, can you tell the three Danish ladies that we are waiting for them? - The name, please. - Mencioni Sandro. Not hers, the name of the three Danish ladies. Of course. What's their surname? - Who asked him? - Sleep dead! It doesn't matter, we already have an appointment. When they get out, tell them we are waiting for them in the salon. Well, sir. However I understand. Must be the three Danish ladies from rooms 213 and 215. - Yes, it must be those. - Miss Hoppingher. Yes please. Let's go? - Soon? - Casa Mencioni? - $ ì. - Sandro? - No, Sandro isn't here. - I'm Magda, where is she? - He left this morning. - With relatives from Bari? - Like? - Those of the "heel". - No, maybe those of Egypt! - From Bari, I said. - And I tell them again, from Egypt. We have no relatives in Bari. He hasn't even come for lunch. My father says that when he comes back, he breaks his "snout". I don't give a damn what he says, I want to know where Sandro is. He, Sergio and Franco have gone out ... to have fun at the "Caves of the Pigeon". - With three "paciocchette". - Three "paciocchette"? "Sgrinfie", "babes", "chicks", girls, how should I say? Girls, huh? And it made me mold all day in the house! Hey! Denmark! There must be something about Denmark! So we make a quick erudition. Denmark is a small town. 4 million inhabitants, 5 million cattle. They have more than one cow each, that's why they eat so much! - And ALBRA? - That? - ALBRA, the forests. - He's not talking about it here. - It's bad. - "Entertainment, climate and clothing, etc.", - "Folcolor." - Folcolor. Then you know Danish. Yes, good evening! But who understands you? However, we already have an appointment. - Maybe they want to kidnap us. - You're not saved. When foreigners arrive in Italy, they jump on you. Now I let them know they have the wrong address. Madame, we are very busy, very BUSY. We can't listen to you, we can't come with you. We are very busy. Sorry, we are expecting three friends, it will be for another time. Sure, tomorrow. - (Good morning, gentlemen. - {TOGETHER) Good morning. What a witch! All he needs is the broom. - What scorpion fish! - And how they insisted! Those are a year older than the Colosseum. - Hey! - Damn! Here I make my father fail! No, Riccardo, I'm not going down. Two beeps, so the young lady understands. And we wait. - Hey! - What's up? - The thighs. # lo, in the night, I just leave. # And whistling I think of the time that was. # When I rejoiced in the hopes I kept in my heart, when I thought I would find joy in love. # That time is gone and it never comes back. # I buried you in youthful dreams. # And now in the night I whistle in the sky. # I'm happy like a king. # Up there in the sky they shine the stars that are listening to me. # The moon, among the clouds, peeps as I pass and it seems that he wants to accompany me. # What do I care if I don't have a heartbeat. # What do I care if love is over. # whistling it in the void night. # I'm happy like a king. # - Something's finally coming. - Let's hope it's not the bill. Here, gentlemen, the deviled chicken. Oh, hell! - What do you have? - I don't remember who to call. To the Celere. # What do I care if the heart doesn't beat. # What do I care if love is over. # whistling it in the night I ... # - Well, what do you have? - I don't know, I had to do something ... What do you care? Think about eating! Ah, finally! Finally, my cuddly! You are beautiful! Gorgeous! You are such a star! It was worth waiting three quarters of an hour. - We're going to have a wonderful evening. - I drive. - Yes Miss. - Great, just the two of us. - We can send the driver away. - No, Riccardo is coming with us. - But Riccardo hasn't eaten. - He'll eat with us. Maybe he's not dressed. He is not dressed. I am, it's Easter, Commander. And happy Easter to you too! Let's go. I like you, you are a mysterious woman! Drink! Drink, cold girl of the north, the wine of the Castles. Oh, the wine of the Castles! No in Denmark. - (But drink it. - {IN MILANESE) It's the bun. - What language does this speak? - "Bun" is Danish. < Danese? - Rock and roll! Dance? - Let's go. Let's go dancing! "A Margaret. Franco." Ah! What a night, huh? Have you ever spent an evening like this in Denmark? Yeah, you don't understand me. Just because you don't understand me, I can tell you. I've been in love with you since this morning. AT the Colosseum. - There. - Ah! In love with the Colosseum. What does the Colosseum have to do with it! I'm in love with you, do you understand? It's not the first time I've loved a girl, however it is the first time that I have the courage to say it. My friends always tease me about it. When I talk to a woman, my tongue becomes paralyzed. I prepare many beautiful sentences, but I can not say them. But with you it's different, and do you know why? Because you don't understand me. - Do not understand. - How nice it would be if you understood me. If you had understood that I love you. Sandro! Where are the relatives of Bari? I parenti? Is... is. Is the blonde your aunt? - A cousin, a country girl. - Of course. Darling, shall we go to our table? See you next round. That's who I had to call! I sweated like a crocodile. - That beautiful lady, your friend? - No, it's my aunt. - Michele, let me dance. - Love, you know I can't dance. - Then I'll dance with Riccardo. - With Riccardo? With the driver? # I see the lie in your eyes. # If you laugh, you are the only one for me. # Adore you, what madness. # I think so, yet I hold tight to you. # My darling, why are you nervous? Come on, tell him. - Riccardo, put out your cigarette. - Yes, sir. - The young lady wants to dance. - You are welcome. Thanks Miss. - Months. - Subito. Do you see that? At the table of those rowdy? Which? There are three of them, miss. - The cutest. - The one with the Prince of Wales? Yup. He insulted me. You have to teach him a lesson. Immediately, with pleasure. - Should I leave my mark? - Yup. - A sign that it lasts at least three days. - I'm going there. She will be happy with me. - Excuse the disorder. - You are welcome. - Allows? Riccardo Moretti. - Pleased to meet you, Mencioni Sandro. - I beg your forgiveness, but I have a position of trust. - You are welcome. - Excuse me. - Mom! What happens here? - Here's the check. - Here is the paralysis. Sandro, make the compress with this! You're welcome ma'am. Nice little place, huh? A little hectic. Very busy. gin genie. # Let me live in a dream ... and talk to me about love. # - Ouch! Ouch! - Does it hurt? Look at what they look like! - Ouch, mom! - But which mom? - Put this on. - Be quiet. Here is what happens to annoy decent women! - Yeah, I was going to lose sleep with you! - Mind your own business! Do you want to go? 'Ste unfortunate! Street! If I meet him again, I turn him into rubbish! Take it easy on this water, you make me get pneumonia! Try to move the neck, if we don't screw it, it comes off. - Here, like this. - I'm dying and they are having fun. Go tell them to stop singing! How can I do? If I remove the patch, the lump is reformed. # O my beautiful Madunina ... # Stop this torment! Don't yell, they don't understand you anyway. Now I'll show you if they understand me. Do you want to hit them? # O my beautiful Madunina ... that you shine ... # They know Italian songs even in Copenhagen. They sing the Milanese anthem. Who knows Franco and the other one where they went to "break". Tell me what you like, but for me this writing is not Danish. - So what is it? - Do you need the electronic brain? But what Nordic and Nordic! They are northerners, buzzurre and traspadane! - Are they Milanese? - You finally got it! These wretches! Laugh Laugh. My bag! Nanda Colombo, Gallarate. I am pure burine. - I'll show you what I do! - Think about how much they cost us. - You wanna work things out in the car? - I ... - It's not even ours! > Guys! Here comes the other who is not drunk. Let's pretend nothing has happened. Boys. Love knows no boundaries. It makes itself understood in all languages ​​of the world. - Also in Milanese? - "Drink" this too! - What happens? - They screwed us. They are Danish from Milan. Since they are drunk, we will do the math tomorrow. Now we will pretend nothing has happened. We mount in the car. Senoritas, good morning! - I don't understand, it's possible ... - Shut up. The Danes found America, huh? # O my beautiful Madunina ... # - (Where are we taking them now? -) To the river! - 28 thousand. - 40 thousand. - And 700 of petrol. It's right. 28, 40 and 700. I'd bite myself on the head! We ran out of 2 months' money. And the foolish figure! If I think of all the words that I ... - that we told him. - We'll put this on too. - They must pay! - Of course they have to pay! For me you have to review them, smooth them ... - and bully him. - Yes, tonight they are not saved. > Sergio! - We missed my mother. > We are ready! Look at these three "sweepers" as they tricked us. Mom, what do you want? I told you I'm not coming. You do not come? And who feels your father? I already have a commitment with friends. But what commitment? What friends? Today is Easter Monday! With friends you will go there in August. Yup! Go, have fun. - Dad, don't get drunk. - Can we know why you don't come? Unfortunate! I'd show you ... ugly son ... of your mother. Kill! I leave you two minutes and you "giggle" the whole shop. It's all decided. Do you have the key? - Here she is. - We agree, we make him pay. One moment. I am angry as and more than you ... but I don't want to be bullied. There are so many ways to make "pan for focaccia". Franco, but we have agreed everything! We take them to the villa ... and they have to stay there. Make him come tonight. Yesterday ... # O my beautiful Madunina ... # Tonight you scream at him. Come on, move! I've been running the engine for an hour! - Help me! - You forget it, get in. Help me. Take the cauldron, I can't take it anymore. Take it easy. Is there other stuff? - Mom, come on. - The throne of the mother-in-law! Here is the lamb! Don't miss it, after all I don't give a damn. - Gentlemen, in the carriage! - Is everything there? Baskets and newspapers! Let's go! Did you bring the baking soda? Help! What are you doing? You lose me! - Pardon. - Have you heard this pecorino? Waiter! Another liter! 'Ste fave don't tell you anything? - Do you like Roman beans? - No thanks. Oh my, what a ruined country this Denmark! They will be nice, but they are just dumb. - More wine? - No thanks. - Another drop. - No. I said no. The wine of the Castles has never hurt anyone. No? After that hangover from last night! Sandro, I make the pecorino cheese claim. Feel that stuff! - Scent of the East! - Please no! How delicate are these foreigners! They only stuff themselves with sfogliatelle and deviled chicken. Bravo, now get the singers to come. The ladies are romantic, they came from Denmark on purpose to hear Italian music. Do you want to hear Roman music? - Sweet, languid. - What do you want to hear? Do you want to hear some of Sor Capanna's stornelli? Bravo, attack! Drink! Drink more, wretch! This is my wife, the one who claims to educate my children ... morally. Let's start with the children? When there is a need to reproach them, they are my children, when there is something to be praised, they are his. That poor son of mine always locked up in a dairy! If for once you want to go on a trip with friends ... That poor creature was not supposed to go on the trip, he had to stay in the family which is Easter Monday. With grandmother... and with the uncle who came from Rocca Marzicana, the poor wretch. Yes, say even beggar! With grandma and uncle, you know what fun! He always had a hard head! Imagine if he didn't agree with his daughter! For the representation of the progeny, Pinuccia was enough, right? Sorry if I intrude, but I'm over here ... Sorry if I intrude, but we ate, we drank, we are very well ... Now we also have the ball! - Let's have a good game! - I'll show you how to play! Come on, place yourself! Take this SPITINICCHE! A me! A me! A me! - See, you are not capable! - Shut up! Get out of the way! Our balloon! Let us play a little bit. Give me the ball back or I'll call my father. Call your sister which is better. - Panzone! - Okay, here's the ball. Go get it. - Let's go. - I was "warmed up". - The no. - Did you see that dribbling? Like in the good times! But aren't you ashamed, I say? Why should we be ashamed? He's right, two old men who start playing football. I even forgot about the villa! With this villa! They don't steal her, she's not a pretty girl! Luckily I have the keys here and I touch them every half hour. How often do you touch them? Hate! The keys! The key to the gate is missing, look! There were four and now they are three! How do I do now? Poor thing, don't be scared, come and drink ... - It's the end of the world! - When did you last touch them? Before leaving. Someone stalked me and took them from me. - Let's go have a drink. - No, let's go back to Rome right away! - We have to go to the police! - Let's drink. Run! I am ruined! After 20 years of painstaking service! Let's go to Rome right away! Forget all the crockery! Run! Mom, she lost the keys to the villa! It is a great responsibility. Take it all, take the chair, the pot, the pan. Forget the old ones! Abandon the old ones! Street! Street! Street! Well done! If only every day were like today! Guys, this is music, other than the Copenhagen Opera House! Too bad you are foreigners, you did not understand a cabbage. - Enough with these insults! - Margaret, shut up. I got it? Stop it, we've figured it all out for quite a while. Do you think so stupid? Fessi no, but rude, rude. At this point it is time to stop with these Romanacci vulgarities. - Yeah, why is Denmark's story clever? - No. Now the game is even, it can be closed like this. Convenient, huh? Do you think like her too? Sure and I didn't think you were vulgar like them. Well-behaved kids would have found a nicer way ... to take revenge on our little joke. They call it little joke. It cost us 40 thousand lire! But do you know how much we have to work to earn them? We thought you were gentlemen! Anyway thanks for everything and goodbye! Marisa, Elsa, let's go away. - Wait a minute, where are you going? - In Rome and on foot! Let's not exaggerate, now everything is clear. Exactly, there is no more taste! Three girls like us are looking for "chickens", you are too smart! Hey, let's go. Guys, before you leave, you have to pay the bill and in cash. - Then do it. - Pecorino cheese... - Do not overdo it. - ..fave ... - Paying the bill? - Yup. - ... wine ... There are 5 thousand. - Huh? - These are prices that make you laugh! - Do you think we're Danish? Take these and look good! Bye! Guys, what are you doing? And they drive around, unfortunates! In Rome, between yesterday and today, almost 400,000 foreigners have landed! The whole Mobile is in turmoil to prevent snatching, pickpocketing, theft and burglary! And Rocca Marsicana is not under my jurisdiction. To me, the Mastelloni counts, I don't care! You don't need to get angry! Remedy a couple of carabinieri. There he and I, you come too ... and we bring this too! Enough, for God's sake! In 5 minutes, I, chief commissioner with two degrees, neighborhood manager I have to search with this survivor. And you've been driving me crazy for half an hour with your Rocca Marsicana, the bandits, the villa and the keys! I don't want to hear anything anymore! Commissioner, excuse him. My brother is a bit of a peasant, he has never moved from Rocca Marsicana, he does not do it out of malice. - Come on, the inspector is busy. - One hour is enough. - I'll show you the way. - I'll take you. Let us borrow at least some machine guns, some tear gas bombs. - Two guns! - We'll find everything on the spot. Street! Or I'll put you in! Via! Take it easy, now let's call the Rocca Marsicana guards. - It's under their jurisdiction. - There are the field guards there, they look at the broccoli, the beets. Better Campestri than nothing! Walk! In an hour they would have solved everything! - Where you run, stop! - Walk, let's not waste time. - How long is it? - Another half hour and we're in Rome. - And tomorrow in Milan. - We are a bit wrong too. - Cafoni! Here I am! - Your Franco too? Yes, he too. - Now I stop the first car that passes. - And if they are there? I go up! Here they are, they are coming. Don't you dare to speak. Walk straight and so do you. Sandro, are we accompanying the dead man? - Accelerate. - Let's get her tired a little bit. Who knew they would get so angry. - I got it right away. - We have to make peace. I do not remain "dry mouth". He still deludes himself. We are now done. - Hey, there's a bag! - Whose? - They have to stop! - This is the weapon! Here they are, at the curve! Ehi, fraulein! To go to Copenhagen, you have to turn left! Mademoiselle, you have left the bag! We bring it back to you! Hey! Where do you go without an umbrella? - We are coming! - We give you a lift to Milan! We also come with you. Don't be pushed, we know that your feet already hurt. You have a great desire to look at us! Yours are coming! Do you need anything? Newspapers, soft drinks, mineral water? Travel pillows! A two. A two. A two. A two. We have the beautiful Danes. Are those flowers to me? - Now stop. - What are we doing? - Do we want to finish it? If you are good, next year we come to the Milan Fair. - How much are you moving. - Little one, don't be unpleasant. Today we were rascals, but yesterday we were gentlemen. - It was a joke. - There's nothing to do. For this thing, how do we do it? - It's blackmail, there are the tickets. - Yeah, the tickets. But what a blackmail! We apologize for the way we behaved. That is fine? Basically we are good guys. Yes, you are good guys. Of the kids, I'm 32 years old! Little one, I can't see with those flowers. Throw them away! I've been on the phone for 2 hours! Please give me 2424 Rocca Marsicana. - That says? - Take off! - Hurry up, miss. - Urge! But what an urge! It says the line is loaded. - Download it! - It's an emergency! It's about life or death! Ready? Ready? Are you Cesira? Long last! You know me? It's me! Gaetano! Of course I recognize you. Urgent phonogram! There. I immediately take a pen and paper. Dictate the phonogram. Stolen keys, villa conte Mastelloni. - Stop. - Stop. Go on, go on! - Armed bandits are about to ransack the villa. - Stop. Together these "stops", then distribute them! Easy, you make me dizzy. I stopped at the bandits. Blackbeard said it: "The Easter Monday to come, thefts and great calamities". Angelino! Commander! Angelino, look out! Angelino! - What the hell is going on? - Urgent phonogram from Rome! - Here is the villa! My villa! - Braggart! - (Open the gates of heaven.> {ILSE) Just heaven. > This key you speak! Pasquale! What are you doing, move! The commander wants you! Angelino! Big things! A phonogram has arrived from Rome! I come. Can't you stay in peace in here either? Take the "shotgun", I call the others! - How about? - Wonderful! - Now let's go swimming in the pool. - And the costumes? - The costumes fit. - Is this villa your uncle's? The villa is ours, but let's not ruin anything, otherwise my uncle goes to jail. Turiddu! Turiddu! > Gathered! > Turiddu! - Chi sei? - The pastor? - What a parish priest, I'm Angelino. Under your orders, commander. At the villa of the counts Mastelloni there are bandits, they must be arrested. Guys, let's drown them! > Leave me! Guys, look how I swim! By dint of being in the water I became a fish. Let's go out, Elsa, I need to talk to you. Wait, I'm coming to sunbathe too. Do not rush! Ouch! The foot! Does this ladder never end? If I catch you, I'll pinch you! Damn how much you run! Here I am! Stand still! - What a paradise! - Where can you find it in Milan? I like you, but you're not my type. I would never marry a milkman. First of all, I'm not a milkman, but a milk industrialist. It is almost the same. Besides, I've never dreamed of telling you that I want to marry you. - Yup? So what did you mean? - Nothing. I was saying that marriage is an outdated concept. Today, a man and a woman just love each other. Forget about it! You found the guy who gets married! And you have found just the girl who is there! Come on, give me a kiss. - Yes, tomorrow! - No now. Oh mama. Bella! - Cu-cu! - Macché cu-cu! Little one, stop! Here I am! Did you run 100 meters in your country? Stop! I have to talk to you! Ouch, your feet! The feet have become like two eggplants! Stop! If I catch you, I swell you! I would have loved to work with children. The social worker, for example. - It makes you laugh? - No because? - (FRANCO} You still have time to do it. - Things that are said. After my father died I had to look for any job, and so I was sentenced to type folders from morning to night for a lawyer. I wait for Sunday as you wait for the holidays. Marisa, now I appreciate you even more. I understand your happiness, your joy of these two days. We were going to waste everything. - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter, dear, I would like ... What do you want? Say that. I would do anything. I was saying nonsense. Tell it. I'm so shy, you noticed it last night. That's not why, Franco. It's just that I go back to Milan and you stay here. Yes, I know. But distances don't matter when you really love each other. You have to have a nice staff, style, poise. But above all you need to have good recommendations. Even in the field of models? I do not believe it. You are naive. Do you really think that it is enough to be beautiful to show? The usual vain industrialists they finance are in charge - tailors and models. - Why don't you change jobs? What? To return to 30 thousand lire a month? What does the profit matter? For you women, sooner or later the husband arrives and he will have to work. I don't let myself be kept. For now, I have no intention of getting married. A modern girl wants her freedom because ... - I intend to become someone. - Ah! Good. Someone with a place of their own in life. Maybe in the sun, huh? Please don't joke. I have to arrive alone, with my work, with my strength. Without any help. Even if this ambition of mine may cost me some sacrifices. Alright then. You have your own personality. But now, on top of this tree, can't you forget it? To think about yourself. To the two of us. - These two days. - Do I look really selfish to you? - No, I would like you more woman. - Why, am I not good enough for you? You're an amazing girl, I like you ... to die for! - No! - Come on, I love you. - Who are those? - If they are not thieves, they are the masters. - My goodness, they better be thieves! - I believe it. We must call the others! We enter from the rear of the villa. Come on, quietly. - Run! - This did not take! If my uncle catches me, he takes my head off. Start the engine! Below! I feel your uncle's engine! Captain! What are you doing? - There's nobody here, the guards want to beat you! - To me? ; "The direct route to Milan at 11.15pm ... is leaving from platform 3 ... " - No. - How not? Now you have to give me a kiss. - No, take me to the train. - Now I'll join you. The holiday is finished. It is the first time that I feel so sad. For real? I am really happy. I mean, glad you're sorry to leave, to leave me. By now I was convinced that a girl like you couldn't be sad. It is always a little sad when a vacation ends. And do you call it a vacation? This was a rush. Let's say a nice walk. I was hoping you could stay here another day. No, it is impossible. Tomorrow we start again with the tailoring, that torment of the owner. Then? Do we break up like this, without a kiss? - I already gave it to you. - That was the kiss of forgiveness. Now I want the goodbye one. At the station they all kiss. No! Besides, what good would it do? See, Sandro, I am sincere. These two days I will never forget them. It was a wonderful two days. What good is a third, a fourth. - Me in Milan, you in Rome. - Yeah, I forgot. Nanda! - You have to be independent to get there. You just think about work. But have you seen what life was like in Rome in these 2 days? When do you go "out of town" to Milan? You go there often, huh? Are you sorry you didn't have enough fun? Forget it. Will you write to me? I don't know, at least a postcard. You have to write me first. > Give me a kiss. You promised to write to me. Of course, a postcard: "I love you like this, I love you just like that." - Hello. - Hello. - I promise you, I'm coming to Milan. - You say that. - I swear, as soon as I get my degree. - Hate! So when? Soon. Now I'm going to study like crazy. - Remember to send me the photo right away. - Are you afraid of forgetting me? I would like to tell you many things. But nothing comes to mind, I can't find the words. - I'll write to you. - But not at home, at the post office, it's better. I need to see how much you love me before I tell my mother. - And you will answer me? - Yup. > Marisa, let's go! What are you doing there? - I must go! > Marisa! In the car, gentlemen. - I love you, Marisa. - In the car, quick. Hello Franco. - Don't forget the address. - No! - Goodbye, little one. - Goodbye guys. - Hi, Sergio. - Hi, llse! - Hi, Margaret! - Marisa, I'm going home to write to you. - Yes, write me. - Please, think of me. - I'll write to you. - Hello! - Hello! I love you, Franco! Hello, little one! - Soon! - See you in Milan for the wedding! Let's go. Stay up with life. He turned you inside out like a sock!
