Darling, what's that supposed to be? It's not quite finished yet. It still needs quite a bit of work on the chest. But, darling, you used to do nice pictures of Grandma and the giraffe at the zoo. Oh, and do you remember that nice policeman you painted? I've done all those things. I want to try something new. Darling, where on earth did you get this? Oh, a boy gave it to me at school. I wanted to paint a nude and I didn't quite know what they looked like. So, he gave me this. Well, she's got a very nice face. Oh, darling, did Daddy break your rocket? Oh, dear. - Never mind. Let's see if we can fix it. - I'd rather do that, please. No, no, no, darling. You fix your rocket. Let Mummy have it. Come on. Let me... Oh! Oh, darling, your lovely... Oh, never mind.

Bursary 3.30. - (Boy 12 barks) Translate, Ornshaw. (Sniggering) Right, sir, erm... (Sniffles) Got a bit of a cold, sir. Erm... Right. Er... Er... Erm... Take two, Ornshaw. Bursary 3.30. Translate, Fensham. The, erm... All right, then. Don't worry about it. Stick with me, you'll be OK. (Indistinct chatter) - Come on. - No! Venite. (Door closes) Ornshaw and Latimer. Come in, gentlemen. Right, Romulus and Remus, stand over there. Stand up, Ornshaw, lad. Stand up. And vacate your mouth. Now, why are you here, Ornshaw? Because you invited me, sir. (Chuckles) And why did I invite you, Ornshaw? Because I couldn't translate the Latin, sir. Why, Ornshaw? Why? Because it's a bloody silly out-of-date language do you mean, sir? Two was it, Ornshaw? I think we make it four. And why do you think it's a silly out-of-date language, Ornshaw? Because I couldn't speak to a dead Roman even if I knew the bloody lingo, sir. Now, do not vex me, Ornshaw. Do not vex me, lad. I think we make that a nice round sexbenissimo. That's "six of the best" in Latin. Game, set and match to me, I think. Julius Caesar here is going to be very displeased with you, Ornshaw. Bend over, please. Ooh! (Gasps) Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh! All right, next one, please, Latimer. Satchel off, boy. Ah! (Ornshaw) Going to orchestra practice? You waiting for old Dicks, are you? Well, you'll be late home. Why don't you shoot off now? There's no point in hanging around. Is old Swailscroft waiting for you, is she? Well, she'll be gone now. Why don't you pop along? I don't know why you're hanging around here. Honest, I don't. I told you it'd be easy, didn't I? (Sobs) Come on, Danny. Don't let her see you cry. I don't know what she's hanging about for. Do you? I told her to hop it, but she keeps on hanging about. Tell her to buzz off. Give us that. He's a scream old Dicks, isn't he? His little Julius Caesar! (Chuckles) You can buzz of now, love. You know, ta-ta, toodle-oo. I thought we'd go to the bomb site. Old Dadds has got the most incredible bomb you've ever seen in your life. He's got a... He's got a Coca-Cola bottle and he soaked it in... He got some socks and soaked it in petrol. And he got some phosphorus, what he nicked from the lab. What...? After that I thought we'd shoot down the arcade. I've got millions of pennies. Er, we could go on the tank-firing range, or, or... Or, erm, the fruit machines, Danny. You like the fruit machines. Or, erm... The football game. You know you like having a go on that. Erm, we could go to the Odeon and see that picture we was talking about. Or go to the zoo, museums, anywhere. Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

(Grandma) I always think ham is nicest straight off the bone. Always is. - Go to the pictures much, do you, David? - Daniel. Daniel? Er, yes. Quite a bit. Hm. When I think of the pictures I always remember my father. When I used to ask him for sixpence for the pictures, he'd say, "There's pictures on the wall." "I wanna see the moving pictures," I used to say. "I'll make them bloody move," and threw his boot at the wall. (Guffaws) Oh, dear me. (Chuckles) My Ernie always used to say that moving pictures ruins your eye sight. Would you like some fish paste, Daniel? "The continual flickering," he used to say, "puts your eyeballs off centre." That reminds me of my uncle Roger. (Chuckles) He was deaf ever since a bomb hit Burwell Street during the war. Recently, he read this ad in the paper about redressing the balance of the ear, so he tried it and it worked. So, erm, he was overjoyed. Oh, yeah. He'd been deaf for 20 years. Anyway, they had a bit of a celebration, you know, and he was opening a bottle of champagne, the cork flew out, knocked his eye out. (Chuckles) Knocked his eye out. Life can be very cruel like that.

(Waves crash, seagulls squawk) My dad doesn't like the seaside. He says he gets the sand in his ears or something. Whenever we go to the seaside Dad always stays at home. In the pubs mostly. We always travel together. We don't get out of the car, though, really. (Chuckles) They generally have a row on the way down. And don't speak to each other until we get back home. Hey, Melody, look what I've got! - That's good! - See? (Melody chuckles) Shall we get married? One day, perhaps. Why does the water always seep away? How old do you have to be, you reckon? Perhaps if we put the stones in first, then maybe it'll stay. I don't know. As old as our parents I suppose. If we wait that long, we might be old miseries. Most old people I know are old miseries. I honestly don't know. When you're older you're supposed to know it all. Perhaps that's what makes them so fed up. (Sighs) I don't know. I really don't know. Oh! It's freezing! I'm going in. (Indistinct chatter, laughter) Come over here. So, we've taken it upon ourselves to move the summer holidays forward a trifle, have we? And where did you decide to go whilst your colleagues went about their daily scholastic duties? Battersea Funfair. That's always a favourite. Battersea Funfair, was it? The seaside, sir. The seaside? You do realise the enormity of this fundamental breach of school discipline? It's... it's not a minor of fence, Latimer, and, er... Perkins. Not a minor of fence. If you're gallivanting off somewhere, you can't be at school and if you can't be at school, we can't teach you. And if we can't teach you, you'll end up raving imbeciles like the generation above you. I don't encourage corporal punishment in this school, but there are occasions when a lesson has to be taught. However... ...you're both rather young. One hesitates to use extremely severe measures. But for your own good try to see the error of these immature pranks. Think of your careers. Think of life's rich tapestry that lies before you. (Chuckles) Look, I understand. I was young myself once. Long time ago, of course. (Chuckles) But I realised eventually what my priorities were. - So do we, sir. - So do you what? Realise what our, er... priorities are, sir. Good for you, Latham. Er... er, Latimer. (Chuckles) I see our little pow wow has had some effect, eh? Got your priorities right, have you? Yes, sir. We want to get married. Oh! (Chuckles) My word, you've got a lot to learn. (Chuckles) I've heard some funny things in my time. I don't think it's very funny, sir. - You don't think it's very funny? - No, sir. And, er, you, young lady? Do you think it's very funny? Not really, sir. I assume you've already promised your fair, freckled first-form hand in marriage to this young gentleman? I don't really know, sir. I don't really understand what it all means, sir. You don't understand what it all means? You don't understand what it all means? You're treating us as though we were stupid. All we want to do is to be with one another all the time. And we thought that meant getting married! Doesn't it?! It's not meant to be funny! Don't you understand? Now, look here, young man. I've been extremely patient with you. I'm willing to overlook your gross ignorance of the young lady. God knows we've only ourselves to blame for that. But your impertinence is getting a little out of hand. The matter is finished. Do you understand me? Finished! (Chatter) (Shouting, cheering) (Chatter stops) (Girl 4) Temper. (Whispers) Burgess says is it too late to propose?

(Chuckles) It's a great pity you're not more in love with your work, Latimer. I'm sorry, Danny. I didn't mean to. (Thunder rumbles) (Music drowns speech) (Reg) You really like this little lad, do you? You know, that's fine, you know. We always look forward to you bringing your boyfriends home. And he, he seems a nice type of... lad. That's just the trouble, though. He's only a little lad. And you're only a little girl. "Our little sunshine" your mum calls you. I know it's difficult to understand, love, but people just don't get married at your age. They wait to see if they like one another when they're older. How old? Well... in their 20s. Older sometimes. But that's twice as old as I am now. I know it is, love. Only seemed like yesterday I was seen changing your nappies. I know, but we want to be together now. Think of all the schooling you've got to do yet, love. And you like school, don't you? I-I've got all your reports. We often look at 'em, don't we, Mum? I know, but I like being with Daniel more than I like doing geography. Sweetheart, there are lots of things we haven't explained to you yet about... ...life and all sorts of things. I know, but why is it so difficult when all I want to do is be happy. We want you to be happy, love. Then why can't you help me instead of keep putting things in my way? I just don't understand it. I just can't think why it's so terrible. Please tell me cos I just don't understand. (Sobs) Tell me, please. (Clocks ticks) Hm, oh! Good morning, Mrs Latimer. What can I do for you this splendid morning? (Mrs Latimer speaks indistinctly) Elope? What do you mean, elope? Oh! I... I'm sure you're quite wrong.
