Nice. Yeah. Nice. Look at mom. All right. Ah-huh. Ah-huh. Beautiful. - Bye, dad. - Bye, sweetie. Glendale, the jewel City, my dad's favorite place in America. I think because here he, technically, doesn't have an accent. At least for now. High school, four years of unforgettable joy, fun, friends, parties, and falling in love. Have a good day, honey. Don't forget to sanitize. Oh my God, there she is. Along with unbelievable stress, excruciating pain, uncertainty, breakups, losing trust in friends and betrayal, just to name a few. And this isn't even close to the life you led at home. No one, no one dumps me. Oh God, this can't be happening. I can't believe this. When I thought things cannot get any worse, I was wrong, it did. Hi there, Sir, license and registration please. I knew this day would come, making my life more miserable. My name is Tennie, I'm 17, and this is the beginning of the worst time of my life. Why haven't you been responding to our texts? Is it true? Is what true? The rumor. Jason has been telling everyone about what happened last night. - That, what, I broke up with him? - No. He said you two had sex last night and that you were not even good at all. He's, obviously, lying walking around thinking he's hot shit. Yeah, we should get this asshole for running his mouth. Well, people do believe him. What? Hold on. Weren't you supposed to go to prom together? Could you be any more useless? Shouldn't you be meeting your new girlfriend that has you by the balls? She doesn't have me by the balls. Jeez, Michelle, is it that magical time of the month already? I can't believe this is happening. Look at me. - He can't do this to you. - It's not fair to you. So he did. It's a beautiful day. - Painkiller anyone? - Advil, Tylenol, ibuprofen. I'll take one of each, please. Where have you been? I had to come up with a bunch of excuses to explain why you were a no-show for the 10:00 a.m. meeting, the 12:00 and then the 2 o'clock. That's your job, isn't it? Daniella, come on, please. Okay. What about your realtor-turned girlfriend Jenny who's been calling me all day worried because you haven't been answering? - Daniella, why did you pick up the phone? - She's too nice. I'm not gonna blow her off. I can't have that weigh on my conscience. That's it. That's it. She's too nice, it's creepy. She thinks we're dating and wants to meet Tennie. Oh no, you trunk your way into her life just to get you a huge deal on a house that's not even on the market. Daniella, come on, what are you talking about? I'm the victim here. You need to break it off. I want to but I can't. It feels like punching a Pomeranian in the face. Are you guys talking about Jenny? She is such a sweetheart. She just added me on Facebook. And congratulations, they opened the escrow, the money transferred. You are good to go. - Huh? - Mm-Hm. All right then, we're celebrating. Ice. I'll be right back. So, are you gonna introduce Tennie to her tonight? - Why would I do that? - Well, she thinks you are. - Didn't you promise her that when you got the house? - Holy shit. I don't need ice. Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. - Mr. Miller. - What? Could I give that a try in Jessica? Keep your mouth away from me. You guys, this is serious stuff, okay? You need to pay attention because this... it could save someone's life. - What the hell-Narbeh? - So you need to look... - Yeah Narbeh, what the hell? - What? We are childhood friends. And I'm your future wife. Keep that in mind. - Left... hand and arm. - Tennie. Tennie. One, two, and then you go one, two- Anyways, I'm telling you, you have to... who is this guy? This is Jack. I'm Jack. - Your cousin Jack? - Yeah, the cousin Jack you asked for earlier, the Uber driver. - The cousin Jack who makes the best Long Island iced tea? - No, that's Uncle Jack. Okay, time out. Daniella, I told you I need someone for a week or two, not some kid auditioning for the next Fast & Furious movie. How many are we at with those anyways? - Nine, ten, eleven? - Nineteen. Nineteen? Yes, his age. He's 19 and family. You asked for him, so take it or leave it. Like practically 20. And what are you willing to pay anyways? Is this guy even worth the trouble, Daniella? He comes with the attitude too, huh. - Come on, let's go. - Yeah. And say hi to your Uncle Jack. Look, for my cousin's sake I just want to let you know that I learned to drive stick at 15 from my brother. At 16, I was parking Escalades. At 17, designated human GPS on every road trip. We are not robbing a bank, kid. I just want you to drive around Glendale within speed limit. And? Twelve hundred for the week, you'll be driving my car. Fourteen hundred. I'll have to stop going to auditions. - What? - He is also an aspiring actor. Chauffeur is the new waiter? Fourteen hundred it is and I'll pay the difference. Now wait in the lobby. - Daniella, you're killing me. - Can I borrow $200? Why? Well, he's family and don't you always say that actors have to eat? Yes, you're right, absolutely. But when they're actually acting. Look, my back, bye-bye. Sometimes I just want to shut down because I'm so stressed up. Tell me about it. I'm fully convinced that the leading cause of my migraines is my mother. Yeah, well at least you guys can dance your troubles away. My lazy-ass stepfather can't even change the ink in our printer. And we've had it for seven years. That's sad. - Hey, Ten, you're still free to join us tonight right? - Great, it's my dad. He needs to show me something. - Hey, who's Hamid? - I'm sorry, who? Tennie's admirer? And how exactly would you know that? Little old fashioned, but I can appreciate. Thank you. Nice guy. Weird, but nice. Anyway, if I'm gonna be driving you around for the whole week, - I get to take the car home right? - Nope. All right, I'm here. - What's the big surprise? You got a driver? - More like a chauffeur. Jack, meet Tennie. Tennie, meet Jack. Hi. - Enough staring. - Okay. Dad, why are we stopping? Tada! - What is this? - It's your new house. - That's right. - Can we go now? Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? Aren't you happy? Don't you want to see inside? Sure. All right. The seller should be here in about 20 minutes. Dad, you bought a house in Glendale, one block away from our old house. That's awkward. What? One of the safest city in Los Angeles, prime real estate. Look, if this is gonna take a while, I have some assignments that I need to turn in. Can we just do the tour later, please? Sure. Sure, sweetie. We'll do it later. Thank you for coming. Listen kid, this is a confidentiality agreement. Oh God, what now? Are you casting me in one of your commercials? Huh, you wish. You're an actor, right? So pretend to be a deaf-mute. You don't say anything, you don't hear anything. And whenever I want, you're also blind, okay? So this quasi blind deaf mute of yours also gets a BMW for the week, right? Fine. Jesus. She was kind of happy today, right? Well, if that was her happy face, remind me never to piss her off. You stay away from my daughter. Did I say you will stay away? I did. You surprised her with a house and all she told you was "nice?" Come on, it's her personality. Obviously, it affected you a lot more than you thought it would. Maybe that's why you're not ready to introduce her to me yet. Well, there is something you should know. Robert, you can tell me anything. All I want is for you to be happy. People like you deserve happiness. Jenny, it's really hard working all the time, being a single dad, raising a teenager. Have you ever considered seeing a therapist? Why? Paying someone to listen to me to talk about my feelings? What's wrong with that? I have for 14 years. I think it would bring the two of you closer together. Fourteen years? 1-4? Wow. Basically, you're half a shrink. I guess so. Good. So another 14 years, then we'll talk. You're such a dumb bitch. Oh, please, cousins, aunts, nephews, nieces, it's all the same shit. No. Susie is my mom's sister. That's why we're so close. Aren't you close with everyone or at least pretend to be like with your dad? That's took years of practice. Tennie. Never with my dad. He's the one I always go to because my mom and I butt heads over everything. Well, if you were stuck with Robert Grigorian, you would do the same. Oh my God, did you see what Narbeh just posted? He's such an idiot. Remember when he had a huge crush on me? Narbeh crushes on anyone with a chest bigger than his. So, everyone. Yeah, pretty much. Come on, let's go. - Hi, Uncle Robert! - Hi, Michelle! Hey, dad. I thought you were gonna come home late tonight. Are you on your way out? I thought you told me you're gonna stay home tonight. I changed my mind. Sorry, it was my idea. I got us tickets for a screening for a movie. It's no huge deal. I don't have to go if you don't want me to. No. No, it's fine. It's fine. - Do you need money? - No, we're good. - Yeah? - Night, Uncle Robert. Goodnight. Hey. Hey, Tennie... I know, I know. - Be safe. - Be safe. Goodnight, dad. Michelle, be safe. Yeah, okay, I'll call you when I get there. I'm here, I'm waiting for you. Hold up. I got someone on the other line. Okay, okay, call me back. - Talk to me. - Get your ass back here now. - Now? - Hurry up. Typical Robert, gets what he wants when he wants it. What is it that you're looking for, mmm? We both know you're not exactly father of the year or the decade for that matter. Thank you for the kind words. You expect to come in here and for me to give you a full report of your daughter - over the past how many years? - She comes to you for everything. Yes, because I'm her aunt. Look, Robert, Tennie is a sweetheart. I know that. But she's also angry. Because she's a teenager. Oh my God, you're just not getting it. All she has is you, Robert. And if you can't see what's broken then, you know, I can't... I can't help you. Then don't. Because there isn't anything broken, okay? Yeah, I wish. No one knows her better than I do. Congratulations on the house, Robert. Michelle, it's getting really weird. I mean my dad's not even in his room and there's music playing in the kitchen. Music. I haven't been able to figure this out. A new house, now this. - I mean, really? - Well, does it at least have a pool? I'm in the middle of a crisis right now and all you can think about is getting a tan? What? First Jason, now your dad. I'm just trying to make the best out of a bad situation. Might as well put on your vengeance style. - I guess so. - That's my girl. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Going to school? - Every day, dad. - Breakfast. - No, I don't do breakfast. I used to be like you. - Yeah. - But one day we'll give breakfast a try. Sure, dad, one day. Be safe. Don't do anything I would do. Like what? Get a random urge to buy a house? This time across the street? Or, you know, I have a better idea. How about get my license suspended just like you? - Yeah. - Good one. Thank you. - Hi, Tennie, how was your morning? - It just started. Oh, I knew that. Hey, I'm just to let you know and I don't want to bring this up again in case you get upset but what Jason did was really horrible, and it's about karma, you know. What are you gonna do? Hamid. Hey, I just... I just want you to know that I'm... I'm here for you. It's not like we mean it or anything like that. I mean you're Wonder Woman and I'm like Steve Trevor. Hamid, that's really sweet but I... I think I know how to handle it. All right, Tennie, no bullshit, just tell me the truth. - Is there anything going on between you and Narbeh? - What? - Is there anything going on now? - Are you serious? No. I need to know if there is or if there will ever be anything going on between you two. Or what, Anna? You're gonna sue me with that future Harvard law degree of yours? Don't worry, your dreams of white picket fences and butterflies are safe. Ugh! Inhale, exhale. Inhale. Do I have to teach you people everything? Your gluten-free fried dumplings are on their way. Why is it taking so long? Is it coming from China? I don't know why you have called me, what's going on? Oh, Robert, thank you for finally being here. - What the hell is going on? - Ask your sister. Marcus is fuming. Okay, get him some valium or something. Oh, sorry, it's my drug dealer's day off today. Huh, good one. Now go. Bye. Hi, brother. Oh, hello sister. Thank you so much for bringing the kid. Oh, I love you so much, sister. I love you, too, brother. Is she okay? Excuse me, are you the chauffeur? U-turn. What the hell is going on? Who is this kid? Stop forcing your ideas on my directors. Oh my God. Now I see where Tennie gets her attitude from. What? Stop changing the subject, that's my job. Francine here is my fortune teller's kid, okay? And don't worry, I got all the release form taken care of. What do you think of her? She's nice. Good. Her name is Rita. She makes four hundred thousand a year. Sunday bring Tennie over to my house and I arrange for you two to meet for dinner, huh? No, thank you. Why not? Robert, it's been five years. We already talked about this. - I said no, thank you, okay? - Plus, I never get to see my niece. You let her spend too much time with the other side of the family that sweet Susie. It's not fair. You know what's not fair? You sticking your nose in people's personal lives and becoming center of attention and wondering why people choose to stay away from you, not to mention missing all the PTA meetings I asked you to attend. - Sis. - So? When are we going to surprise Tennie - with the new house? - About that- What do you mean about that? No, no, you told me I'll be there. - You said I am going to be there to surprise Tennie. - What's going on? Armenians, very passionate people. I see. - I love you. - I'm gonna be there. Yeah man, we got this. Hold this. Who did this to my car? Oh my... Fuck. Come on. Let's go. - Hi, Uncle Robert. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Mr. Grigorian, please take a seat. Thank you. Dad, I didn't do anything. Okay. This is a very serious situation. This is a car of one of our students, Jason Bourne. - Are you serious? - Yes, Mr. Grigorian. - Is that his real name? Bourne. - Yes, it's his real name. Okay. We don't tolerate vandalism of any kind at this school. Dad, I was in study hall. - I promise. - Tennie, we have witnesses that place you near the car just prior to the incident. I'm sorry but what is that supposed to mean? I'm concerned that if we don't find a resolution today there may be consequences beyond the school. So you're saying no one else might have done it? I mean, it's a big school right? Mr. Grigorian, it's come to my attention that there's a prior history between these students. Hmm. So retaliation is not out of the question. It has nothing to do with it. Mr. Grigorian, Jason's family is a major supporter of both our school and the district. If they choose to take legal action, I am afraid I won't be able to support you. Thank you very much. I really understand and I appreciate. - So how much? - Dad! Mr. Grigorian, I'm not sure what you had in mind but that is not how we do business here. - May I use your pen? - Dad. I'm trying to be supportive. Yeah? Tennie. Tennie. Tennie. Dad, what is it? What do you want from me? You already told me over there that you're disappointed in me. I just want to know about this Jason guy. I mean you don't believe me anyway, so why bother? - Mr. Grigorian, Jason... - Shut up, Narbeh. Tennie, I just paid $2,000 for damages and you're lucky I convinced them to only give you a Saturday morning detention. Why did you do that? I already told you I didn't key the car. I did it! Hamid? Hold on a second. You're Hamid? See, Narbeh? That kid's got balls. It wasn't fair what happened to Tennie. I couldn't take it anymore. And? Yeah, I don't think that kid's got two grand. Satisfied? Can I go now? Yes. Case closed. I'll make it up to you. Mr. Grigorian, I don't know if this is the right time to give this to you but this is the reel I asked Tennie to show you. I would love to get into directing and production. I'm sure you do. Hurry up. Okay, we'll talk. Oh, hey, man, could you do me a huge favor and make sure he takes a look at it? - Yeah. - Where the hell have you been? I've been waiting for you for four minutes. Anna, there's a situation here. What? The Tennie-Jason thing? Well, if what he said wasn't true, she wouldn't key his car, would she? Right, but she didn't. Hold on. - Who is this guy? - Some guy Tennie slept with. Anna, that's a lie and you know it. What? That she didn't sleep with him? Or that she wasn't even good? That's just some bullshit rumor. Stop it. Wow. So this Jason guy, I mean does he live around here? Huh? Out of everyone who would have done this, - who would have thought it'd be Hamid? - Yeah. - And didn't he also write you a letter? - Yeah, an actual letter. - But to key a car? - Well, people do crazy things when they are in love. Shut up. And on top of it, this whole thing with my dad, it's honestly so embarrassing. Well, only a few more months, then college. That's true. By the way, have you heard back from Berkeley yet? No, not yet. Thinking of going for a campus visit this weekend. - Hmm. - My cousin who's there said I could stay with her. Plus, I have been chatting online with someone who goes there. Oh, you sly, you never mentioned him before. - Who is he? - Nothing serious. I'll let you know when I figure out more. Fine. But I'm gonna want details. There you go. Hello? - What's up? - Where are you guys? Narbeh is staring at your cousin like a creepy stalker again. Again? I swear to God, I'm gonna kill him. I saw this today and it just screamed Robert's. - Perfect for an honest, humble- - No. sensitive family man. Please stop. So how long until the escrow closes? It's only been a couple of days. That's good. Good. Don't worry, it's a sure thing. - What's the matter, hon? Did something happen? - Nope. Robert, the first step to solving a problem is admitting that there is one. Huh, sorry. It's Tennie, isn't it? Maybe you should just hit pause on everything and spend all your time with her. That's a great idea. I mean that's a great idea, really. I should. There is nothing that you and I can't handle. One more, please. - Double shot. - Hey, Jen. - Hey. - It's been a while. - See you at the birthday party in a couple of weeks? - Looking forward to it. Robert, do you think about your past very often? I am more concerned about the present, I would say. If you really listen to her, you'll know what makes her happy. 3 Series, beautiful car. This car is the full package, all the options, moon roof, navigation, sport suspension, even a limited edition sunset orange. - Beautiful. - You know she's not good with surprises, right? You know Uber hires other actors, right? Sunset orange, it's beautiful. Your daughter's gonna love this car, Robert. All right. Ah, anything for my favorite niece. Look guys, if you need anything, let me know. Thank you. I don't know what to do. Gotta find a way to break it off with Anna. Ladies, there are no bad ideas? I would literally take anything right now. Seriously, Narbeh? Haven't you broken up with her like five times already? I know. I know. She doesn't seem to get it. No, you idiot, you don't get it. You helped her with her art projects, you painted her a new bedroom. Jesus Christ, you're friends with her parents on Facebook. - So what? I can't be a nice guy now? - It's not about that. I mean you put it in her head that you're this perfect boyfriend and you misled her every single step of the way. And you're giving her hope for a future you don't even believe in. All right, all right. Are you talking to me or Jason? - Ouch! - Look, forget about him. - Who was that guy with your dad today? - Oh yeah, he was cute. - What's his story? - Some guy my dad just hired. No stories. And please don't start with one. Yeah, I mean you already have five guys waiting to hear from you about prom. Besides, I'm sorry, that guy was kind of weird. - What do you mean? - Well, after you guys left, he was talking to me. He started asking about Jason. Well, what did you say? Nothing. I didn't say anything. Hey, call it. Students, future art connoisseurs. Today we discuss the fundamentals of art. What does it all mean? What does it- Dah! Hmm. Tennie, you're leaving. The principal would like to see you. Oooh. That should do it. Yep. Good job. Thanks. So you were parked and then this 90 years old woman trying to get into her car broke the side mirror with her oxygen tank and you didn't even notice? Yeah. - Robert, why would I lie to you? - Well- Okay, look, all right. Look what I got. Japanese scotch. They say it's one of the best. - What is it, your insurance policy? - Yeah, call it a deductible. - How old are you? - Don't worry about it, I got my sources. I do worry, Jack. Thank you. Here's the check your father wrote to the Bourne family. Jason thinks there's no reason to escalate this. Now, Tennie, you are one of the best in the class and you have a bright future ahead of you. Make me proud. Thank you so much. Hey! Tennie. Tennie. Tennie! Tennie. I can't hear you. Hey. Hi, Tennie. Yeah. I'm sorry for what I did, but I had my reasons. Hamid, you could have at least given me a heads up so I could tell you how stupid it was. But it was very brave. Really? Thanks. - Did you get a chance to read the letter I wrote you? - No. Hamid, I didn't, and I probably won't. Honestly, you are a great guy and I do love you but as a friend. I think the thing that I appreciate most about our friendship is the respect we have towards each other, you know. - But what if we could develop that into something? - No. Hamid, look, we come from two different worlds, two different cultures. - I mean starting from the foods we--What does that matter? Hamid, my dad once told my cousin that in the wild a giraffe has a baby giraffe and an elephant has a baby elephant, but you never see a baby giraffe and a baby elephant try to, you know... Shit, that's kind of racist, huh. A little bit. I love Thai food. Me, too, but 'm on a diet. Robert, where have you been? I need you to look at something. - What is it? - Well, we have a new rough cut for the commercial. Mm-Hm. But we don't have the product yet. All right. The perfect walk. The wonderful friends. The magical kiss. And then this. What could be missing all this time? Trust. Love. Dino Tention for Men. Wow, that is wonderful. - It's really good, isn't it? - This is the worst tagline that I've ever heard. It was your idea. Was it? First step to solving any problem is admitting that there is one. - That's deep. - Mm-Hm. Who have you decided to go with at the prom? I don't know yet. There is... Okay, there is five guys. One of them is cute and then the other one just has a nice personality. It's just that there are five people and I want my prom to be perfect. And I need the perfect date for us. Just pick the most attractive one. Oh my God! You lucky bitch. My favorite car and my favorite color, too? I swear, Michelle, if you say one more freaking word. - Looks like she's very excited. - She's gonna love it. - You don't be excited, okay? - Okay. Yeah, come on. Ta-da! What is this? It's a surprise to my beautiful, amazing, smart Tennie. You deserve it, sweetheart. You really shouldn't have. Come on, enough of driving that old car, okay? - But why? - Tennie, it's the ultimate driving machine. - Practically everyone in Glendale drives one, right? - Yeah. You're not from Glendale. That's nice, but you never bothered to ask me. - Ask you? Ask you what? - I like Saab. Saab? Do they even make those cars anymore? Let's go, Michelle. Tennie. Tennie. Tennie, would you please at least give it a try? Test-drive it. I mean it's the least we could do, your dad went through all this trouble. Just my opinion. You know what, Dad? You're right, let me give it a test drive. - I mean it's the ultimate driving machine, right? - Yes. - How fast does it go? - The speed limit... I think Jack should go with him. - What? - For safety. I don't... I don't think that's a good idea. You know what? I think it's a great idea. Let's go. - Okay. Jack, be safe. - No, we'll take my car. What? Your car? You wanna test drive with your car? But why? Robert, you want me to find you a family therapist for research? Yes, it's called consulting. Oh, right, consulting. I get it. Are you talking about the new client from Brazil or Peru? Robert, I know you. You never consulted with anyone your entire life. Just book me an appointment ASAP, okay? Daniella, you know what? That's why you're still single. - Bye. - Robert. Robert. Ask her if she talked to the guy. How about my tattoo? - It's my mom. - Oh, shit. I thought it was Laura. - She is on the other line. - Your aunt is so nice she just gave this to me. - Credit cards only for emergencies. - Welcome to my entourage. Funny, just like your dad. Please don't ever compare me to my dad. Sorry, my bad, I'm just... just saying you're smart and witty, passionate. You're cool. - Wait, you see all of that in my dad? - Yeah. I mean he's got an extra element of douchiness but I like it, it suits him. Is that how you handle him? It takes a douche to deal with him. - You are just full of compliments today, aren't you? - Every day. So was that my dad's idea or yours? So, what'd I miss? Oh, shit, is that Jason? I don't know what you're talking about. Whoever did this deserves a medal. Last chance. Look, I don't know what's going on in that pretty little head of yours, but I don't know what your dad's up to, all right? I'm on a need-to-know basis only. What is that supposed to mean? What, you signed some sort of confidentiality agreement or something? Seriously? Do I look like someone who keeps things confidential? That's a shame 'cause no one's ever stood up for me like that. - Didn't I say from day one we should kick this guy's ass? - It's not a bad idea. Nice. Nice. Thank you. Thank you again for seeing me. Sure, no problem. Okay. Now, how do we do this? Well, you wanted me as a consultant. Tell me about your project. - What area could I be of use? - Okay, I tell you, it's about a single dad and his 17-year-old daughter. Okay. And? And, well, it's about a client of mine, basically, a friend. Yes, I will say a friend who has problem with his daughter. Okay. So what exactly is the conflict between you two? Oh, no, no, no, no, not me. I said my client friend. My apologies. Before we continue, I should say that a family therapist is here to help resolve issues with no judgment, no biases. Whatever is said here doesn't leave the room. That's the law. Okay. Now it's up to you. Are we talking about your client, your friend or perhaps yourself? Hmm. - So, $400 an hour? - Fifty minutes. Ah, it hurts. One, two, three four, and one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, - one, two, three- - Yeah. - four, and one. - Laura, that's the tattoo I want. - I mean, can your guy do it? - Four, one, two, three- I would pay whatever it costs, I don't care. I just really want that tattoo. Three, four and one. One, two, three, four. Stop the music! Stop filming me, you're getting in my way and making me nervous. Narbeh, get your ass over here. You girls don't appreciate my friendship. I'm trying to capture your talent for the big screen. If Anna finds out that I'm here and not filming her campaign video for a school president or whatever that is, I am screwed. Here's your appreciation. Now shut up. Oh my God! Please tell me there's more. I gotta make a calendar. - A calendar? - What? Disgusting. You see it's not a big deal, right? Well, after hearing what you've had to say so far, as a consultant for your project, I would tell you that a teenager needs attention. By not having both parents around and by being raised by mainly extended family members, it would suggest that the remaining parent take a more active role in the child's life. That's right, you are correct. But if I was your family therapist, I would say that your teenage daughter at this point needs a father and not a friend. I get it, you're right, absolutely. Father, not a friend. I get it. But I wanna be your friend. Dad, that's not how this works. - Why not? - I don't know. Okay, I'm just saying, all right? Just think about it. Hey. Friends forever, huh? Okay, dad. But this never happened. Never. Call me later, okay? Tennie, my wonderful, beautiful, one-of-a-kind niece. I miss you so much, my Tennie. Listen, what's going on? You don't call, you don't text, you don't spend the night at my house anymore, huh. I'm sorry. But it's okay 'cause I love you so much. Tennie, I love you. Wait, look, what I've got for your new car, huh. - Ta-da! - Oh God. Thank you. - Sweet. - You like it? - I do, I do. Thank you. - Listen, this is a traditional handmade evil eye, okay. You hang it in your car and it will keep you safe. - Oh, and for extra safety... - Thank you. Excuse me, is there one more to keep you away? Hi, Robert. Listen, pick a date, we're gonna go shopping for your prom dress. It's on me, non-negotiable. Hold on a second, what dress? Prom dress? There is a prom? When? I'm buying it. - Okay? - Hello, hello, I said non-negotiable. You already got her a car and a house. I love you so much, but I gotta go. I love you, too. - Spending the night at Laura's. - Yeah. Wait, wait, who's Laura? I don't know any Laura. Is she Armenian? You are seriously sick! Oh, speaking of sick... Look what I've got for you. Three more ladies, okay. Lady number one. - Seriously? - Lady number two. - Hey. - So thanks for signing the documents I forgot. Oh, no problem. So, Indian for dinner tomorrow night? Oh, yeah, spicy but yeah. - Thank you. - Bye. God, I love this guy. ♪ This spot would have been Perfect for Ronnie ♪ ♪ But now he's nothing But a dead body ♪ ♪ This spot would have been Perfect for Ronnie ♪ ♪ But now he's nothing But a dead body ♪ - Who's getting popped? - Undercover Arnie. - Who's getting popped? - Johnny Toodos? You're right, Arnie, pop-pop. - Oh my God! - What do you know? She's just a regular gal. Yes, but I do know who the undercover cop is. All right, let's put it to a vote and pop whoever's most suspicious. - Start with Tony. - Tania. - All votes for Tania. - Shit, it's your dad. Oh my God, no, no, no, look, I am completely innocent. - You can't do this. - Shoot her... - Okay, listen to me. - Come on, sit down and stop shouting. - Won't she? - Come on, who is this chick anyway? God. Tennie. Tennie, what's happening? What's going on? You! You... you're the problem. How did you even know I was gonna be here? I mean Jack, did you tell him? No. No, no, no, no, no. Sweetie, last week I got an email from the PTA. - The PTA. - That there is a play. Since when were you a part of the PTA, dad? You can't keep doing this. I mean it's just... it's like you don't even know me. Mr. Grigorian. Mr. Grigorian, good evening, Sir. - I don't know if this is a good time. - It's not. Good evening, Sir. My name is Anna. Narbeh's girlfriend and one of Tennie's friends. - So, what did you think of tonight's performance? - Which one? Hold on a second. - Aren't you the wannabe director? - He already is one. - Have you seen his reel? - I have. It's actually pretty good. - Is it? - Hold on a second. I think I have a spare copy. It's okay. Have you ever done any documentaries? Not yet. Narbeh, this is what I want you to do. I want you to make a documentary on Tennie without her knowing about it. I couldn't do that. She's one of my best friends. This could be your big break. Consider it a job. Sit down, it's not the time. Listen to your girlfriend. - And producer, right Narbeh? - Let's not rush into things. You know, maybe instead of pushing him away you could find a way to bring him in. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. I think I get it. You act like you and your dad are best friends and you could get him to do whatever you want. I do it all the time. Yeah, Michelle, we know. Tennie, you don't have to answer this but why doesn't your dad date? It's been years. That's something you have to ask him, not me. Maybe if we found him someone- - Like a hooker? - Seriously? - What? - A hooker? Yeah. I want you to film everyone, I don't care, friends, family, man, woman, no gender, anyone who knows anything about Tennie I want to know. - Mr. Grigorian... - Consider it done. - I like her. - Think about it. There are so many divorced and single women that would love to go out with your dad. And creating a dating profile for him would be a piece of cake, right, Michelle? No, I don't think so. He's really stubborn. Plus, he's kind of shy and awkward with woman. I don't think it's gonna work. I'm not gonna betray her trust. You're not betraying anyone. You're repairing a relationship between a father and his daughter. They give Oscars out for this. Good. Now. Listen to your girlfriend, I mean producer. Confidentiality agreement. Fine, I'll do it but under one condition. Done. Cheers. Bye. Look, if you're gonna go through with this, you need to be nice to your dad and you have to hang out with him. That will give us the time to make him a dating profile. A dating profile? I mean he does want to spend some time with me. - What? She cute? - Yeah, she's really cure. - She Armenian? - No, she's Asian. Oh. - Hey, dad. - Hey. You know what I was thinking? Let me guess, a trip to Bahamas. - No. - No? How about Germany? Spain? Sweden? Sweden? No, not Sweden. - Safari? - No, dad. - No? - No. You know how we've gotten a lot closer lately. Yes. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. Say what? I think you should start dating. Me? No, no, no. I don't think so. Not for me. Why not? Come on, women check you out everywhere we go. Women check you out there. No, no. - Really? - Yeah. - They do? - Mm-hmm. No, I don't know. - Is there anything you know that I don't know? - No, of course, not. Is there anything I should know that I don't know? No. Okay. Look, it's really simple. All you do is go to these meet and greets and within the first minute you can decide if you want to see these women again or not. Tennie, I don't know. I'm not comfortable. You know it's not for me. - I mean I want to... - I already made you one. - Is that me? - Mm-Hm. Look, all these women are dying to meet you this Wednesday. Come on. You know what? I'm not comfortable but I will think about it. Look, this one's really pretty, look. I don't know. Let me think about it, okay? Please. If you're not gonna do it for you, can you at least do it for me? - Robert? - Yes. I received my PhD from Harvard specializing in gender studies with a focus on domestic violence in our patriarchal society across the past century. So I'm too emotional. So I thought that... that I am open to expressing my emotions. Do you like kids? I hate kids, especially teenagers. I love my kids. But after a certain age you have to look after yourself. They look sticky and they smell funny. Ugh! I oppose traditional male roles and I do not partake in the consumption of alcohol of any kind. You are in a bar. I am not annoying! Am I? Are you the kind of man who can satisfy me? I can try. Dad. Hello. Hello. Whoa. Oh! What did you say? Okay, you know what? Uh, I'll... I'll think about it, okay? I love you. Can I at least pick you up after work tomorrow? We can talk about it then. Sure, sure. - So, Robert, what do you think? - Do I like pink or sky-blue? I think you would look good in either. - So I'll just get both. - Jenny. Jenny, Jenny, about tonight's dinner, I just wanted to let you know that I might not be able to make it. Hello. It's okay, I understand. I'm sorry. No need to apologize. I'll talk to you later. Do you see what she does to me? I really have to end this. So why don't you? Because there is still two weeks till the escrow closes, okay? Now go. Hey, your dad's with Blake in the downstairs studio. They should be in just a couple more minutes. - But I'm going to Starbucks. You want something? - I'm good. - Thank you. - Cappuccino, coffee, frappe? Nice flowers. Who are they from? Oh, you know, satisfied clients. So, okay, bye. "You make me feel so complete. Jenny." Hey, Laura. No, I've not seen what you posted, yet. Of course. Always. Hey, make sure to snap us everything. Hi. Sorry, I just came to drop these off for Robert. It's okay. I'll talk to you later. Oh my God, you must be Tennie. Yeah. - Do I know you? - You are even more beautiful than in your pictures. - Um... I'm sorry, you are? - Oh, I'm Jennifer. But you can call me Jenny. It's nice to finally meet you. This Jenny? Ah, I thought I'd sent those to the house. I'm sorry, I need a second. Honey, are you okay? Blake, this is good. Can I watch it one more time? We are on this Earth for a reason. We fix the hearts that are infirm or failing, and nurture them to rise in health once more. We've seen a thousand tales of hope prevailing, communities made stronger than before. You inspire us to do more than practice medicine. You inspire us to transform lives. Adventist Health, Together Inspired. Hello, Bamboo Dumpling, how may I help you? Hello? Somebody there? The one that tried call back? Why did you just call a Chinese restaurant? Oh, I thought I was calling the hospital. Oh my God, there is no number. Huh. But you did good. Just the number. - Blake. - Yeah. It starts with eight-one-eight. Thanks, boss. All I am asking is an email, Daniella. Thank you. Talk about fate. - Hi. - Hi. She just came by to drop off your gifts. And here she was. Who would have thought? Not even in my wildest dreams. I see you two have met. Yep. She's very nice, dad. A bit annoying, but nice. - Tennie... - It's okay, Robert, I have been droning on since I got here. Please, let her express herself. Yeah, Robert, she talks a lot. Now it's my turn. - Can we do this at home? - Why would we do this at home? We're all here, aren't we? Unless you want to invite her home, or maybe she's been there already. Tennie, stop. You have every right to ask questions. Go ahead, ask me. Tell me three things you love about my dad. She's been nothing but nice. It's okay, Robert. Your father has a big heart. Yeah, his cardiologist thinks so, too. - Tennie. - What? He's loyal. Loyal to whom exactly? His employees? His clients? You? Or me? Okay, time to go. And I love your father's honest nature. Are you freaking kidding me? What planet are you from? - You're not very bright, are you? - Hey, Tennie. I'm so sorry, Robert. Obviously, I'm not good enough for your father. Thank you for making things clear. - You're welcome. - Jenny. Jenny. Je... I'm very disappointed in you. I don't care. What? I wish you would have asked me what really matters. And that's how your father feels about you. You are his entire world. You are part of every decision that he makes in his life. And he loves you more than you will ever know. Om... - Robert. - No more Jenny. No more Jenny. No more Jenny. Are you serious? You mean it's over? - Wait, Robert, what about the house situation? - That's why I have you. You... I gotta go. We'll talk. Robert. Argh! Hey, dad. Hey. I have something to tell you. It's about Jenny. I wanted to apologize for the way I acted. Good, you should. I think she's good for you. You should keep seeing her. After what happened today? You're too young to understand. What do you mean I'm too young to understand? I'm not a child. What you did today was childish, okay? And you're a hypocrite. You know that? Excuse me? First you teach your child to grow up without dating outside the race and then you go do the exact opposite. Are you serious? You have no idea what you're talking about. Dad, you lied to me! And yeah, maybe that's why I acted the way I did. And I admit it. I was wrong. Good. Good? I came here to apologize and you just made me feel worse. You know you always do this. Do you love me? I mean do you really love me? Of course, I love you. You say that but how come I don't feel it? What do you mean you don't feel it? I mean, either you love me or you don't. Do I love you? Yes, of course, I do. And what about that? This is just barely a hobby. No, I remember when that started. Mom didn't make you happy. - Please, Tennie, okay? - No, dad. You want to get to know me, right? You gotta know that I remember everything. I remember the arguments you and mom had when I was 12, the sad unhappy environment I was growing up in. Dad, you almost left us! And then it all changed. Mom got sick, so you decided to stay and you held her hand till the very end. And I play that moment in my head over and over again. But if I could go back and mom was still alive, and I think you were happy without her, I'd prefer you guys to go your separate ways. And now you're stuck with me. Tennie, I'm just saying I do not like this idea at all, okay? Dad, Jenny deserves to know how you feel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just going to dinner... come on, can I just call her? Maybe it's too much. - I can text her. - No, this has to be in person. Come on, hold her, show her how much you care for her. Anything else? Oh, boy. I need a drink. No, no, honey, it was my fault. She was a wonderful kid. You're lucky. We are lucky. I knew you would come back to me. Like I said before, it's fate. Although you haven't said a word tonight. Just you being here, I can see it in your eyes. I can feel it in your touch. I couldn't imagine being anywhere else right now. Good evening, Mrs. Stevenson. Excuse me? Who are these people? They are my husband's associates. - What? - It is his birthday. It's time to go. He won't cut the cake unless you were there. He won't cut... Sorry. I thought you said you were divorced. Separated. Separated. What? You still love me, right? Love has nothing to do with this. Excuse me. Compliments of your daughter. My... Tennie? You didn't even care for her to begin with? All this just for a house? Prime real estate. Okay, but you could have at least, you know, told me that so I didn't spend my entire savings to hire a violinist. Well, she was good. Well, what about the other night? Right here I poured my heart out to you, I cried apologizing for Jenny. Sorry. But it was very sincere. Dad, you can't go behind my back like that. You have to be honest. - Please? - Hmm. Thank you. Do you have anything else to say? Anything at all? Nope. Okay. I think Blake is gay. - What? - I don't know, I'm just saying, maybe. In case if it's true, okay? Just saying. - We're cool? - Sure. Good. You want to come to Sacramento tomorrow? It's only for one night. No, Dad, I'm good. Plus, Laura's coming back tomorrow. Okay, all right. - You'll be safe? - Promise. All right. Give me a kiss. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Hi, Mr. Grigorian. This is Narbeh. I finished the editing of Tennie's documentary as I promised. Everyone from school, her relatives interviewed. The only people, and I didn't approach, of course, are Michelle and Laura knowing they wouldn't want to be a part of it. With everything with shots, I think you'll really get to know who she is. Yes, Ma'am. Jack, I would never ask you this unless I really trusted you. Yeah, you know you can. - What's up? - I need a huge favor for tomorrow night. - Oh, this party is gonna be so cool. - I know. Okay, I get it, Robert. Just tell me what happened. What do you mean you're back? You're at the airport? Okay, well, just take a cab, an Uber or something and I'll just figure out where the hell he is. - All right. - One, two, three, four! You did something to your hair? - Yeah, do you like it? - Yeah, I love you guys so much. Honestly, don't trust anybody the way I trust you. - Hey, girls. - Hey! - How you guys doing? Can I get you guys anything? - Jack. Okay guys, watch this. - Here, got your drink. - Thank you. Narbeh, get your cute butt over here. I need you to film this. - What the hell? - Everybody quiet down! Have your camera ready. Come on, let's go. This is gonna be epic. I have something to say. - You're getting this, right? - Yeah, go ahead. I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight, especially you, and my best friends Michelle and Laura. I love you guys. And the one and only Narbeh behind the camera. He has been my best friend since childhood. Who would have thought he'd be the one to stab me in the back. - What is she talking about? - I have no idea. Don't you dare turn that off. You keep that shit on. Don't touch me, asshole. You're a part of this, too, huh? Okay, Tennie, look, you're drunk. So what? Who else here was in it, huh? Which one of you assholes got in front of the camera? You have something to say? Just say it to my face or get the hell out of my house! Narbeh, why? Out of all the people in my life you are the only guy I ever trusted. Okay, look, you got to stop acting like this. Let's go. Or what? You are gonna report me to my dad? He doesn't have to, he's already here. Welcome home. Sorry about the mess. - Have you been drinking? - So what if I have? I'm sorry, Robert. Sorry about what? For getting us all those drinks? How does it feel, Dad? This is what betrayal feels like. You looked me straight in the eyes and you lied to me, again! I hate you! - Tennie... - I never want to see you again. Hold on a second, Robert. She'll be fine. She's resting. Robert, you've seen me go through this before, remember? What's interesting is that she called me earlier today asking about spending the night. I know you're disappointed. Trust me, although she's 17, she's more mature than you think. You know let her stay here for a few days until you figure things out. Tennie, call me, text me if you need anything, okay? Okay, contact the client. Anything else, more ice? - Robert, you okay? - Yeah. - You would tell me, right? - Thank you. You fired my cousin? He brought alcohol into my house and gave it to my daughter. Look, Jack is devastated. Honestly, I thought it was good for him to be around you. I thought you could mentor him like you did me. It looks like it was a bad idea to begin with. To have my cousin driving you around or trying to be another one of Tennie's friends? Tennie. Tennie, I already said I was sorry. Tennie, can you talk to me please? Tennie. It's okay. She'll forgive you eventually. You just have to give her time. ♪ I'm better than you You, you, you ♪ ♪ Let it lose It's time to set the groove ♪ ♪ Listen up, let me show you What I got you up ♪ ♪ So congregate You said you better be great ♪ ♪ You have no clue what It takes not be replaced ♪ ♪ If I have to warn you Jump or lose it ♪ ♪ One day remains unchanged I'm better than you ♪ ♪ You, you, you ♪ You know that English test was pretty hard today. Yeah, I hate that teacher. Narbeh doesn't deserve this. What do you want, Anna? Look, I came to apologize and to give you this. Narbeh was against it from the beginning. He didn't want to screw over one of his best friends. I was the one that pushed him into it. If you want someone to blame, blame me. And you expect me to believe that? Believe what you want but it's the truth. I just figured you deserve to see it. Maybe then we'll see which Tennie you end up choosing to be. What is that supposed to mean? It's all in there. How could you believe that bitch? Tennie, I think you should watch it. - Why? - Because I did. Narbeh showed it to me. Hey, Tennie. So before I start filming, I'm recording this I guess just to let you know that I never intended to harm you. It's just that I finally have the opportunity to get a final cut on my own project. I mean not even Scorsese got a chance to have final cut on his first movie. So there's that to think about. In any case, peace out. Yeah, Tennie is pretty cool. She can be a bit cold sometimes, but I know if I ever need any help, she'll be there. Tennie, I love her. She's family, you know, but she's a bit spoiled. She knows it. She likes it. Tennie, she has good and bad days. She doesn't talk to people like me. It's that time of the year again, folks, the Mother's Day jewelry campaign. - What do we have? - All right, I got it, I got it. What if we go all the way back? I mean you don't remember your first words or being born, right? No, but your mom does. - Exactly. - Go on. Imagine all of these memorable events from a child being born all the way to when she's grown and presents her mother the diamond and then a text reads throughout the ad. "I don't remember seeing mom for the first time. I don't remember my first step. But when I look at you, I see it all in your eyes." Happy Mother's Day. I love it. - Hallelujah! - There you go. You're welcome. - Robert, where are you going? - You got this, Daniella. You got this. All right, guys, let's get to it. To what do I owe the pleasure, Mr. Grigorian? Sorry, okay? But... but let's cut the BS. - What's said here stays here, right? - Correct. You are not gonna judge me or anything. Also correct. - And you're here to help, right? - Only if you truly want my help. I do. - I do. - Okay. What makes you think you can walk in here, take my patient's time away and expect me to believe that you're truly ready for my help? Because she's all I got, okay? It's not going to be easy. I know. Are you ready to revisit your past when you suffered true loss? Yes. - Will you confront the truth and open yourself up to the pain? - Yes. Stop lying to yourself and stop hiding behind your drinking? Yes. You're going to feel vulnerable. Do you have the courage to be vulnerable? Whatever it takes. Like I said, she's all I got. Good. Now, tell her that. Tell her exactly how you feel. Who the hell do they think they are? Ah, you know the entire school thinks I'm cool. I may have a bit of an attitude but at least they appreciate me. But my family, my own family thinks I'm faking, pretending to be someone I'm not. I mean, come on. - Well, aren't you? - What? No, I'm not- Why would you even say that? You saw it yourself. Plus, it was meant for your dad. Why would they lie? Stop pretending, Tennie. I have also been pretending to be someone I'm not for a while now. I've been having identity crisis and I haven't told you or anybody else because I don't know how you'd react and I don't have many friends, you know? Laura, it's me. You know you can tell me anything, right? The... the person at Berkeley that I've been talking to is a girl. She's amazing. My experience that weekend confirmed who I really am. You're the only one who knows this now. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Come here. Look, why did you feel the need to keep this from us? I didn't want to take the chance to lose you guys, so I had to lie. You're not gonna lose us. It's okay. Hey, once you're ready to tell everyone, you know I'll be right here for you, right, right behind you the entire time. Thank you. Of course. Come here. It's Michelle. "Don't kill me, I'm driving your dad's lawyers right now." - What? - I have no clue. And there's a video attached. I don't know why you're so upset. Because you can't seem to get it through your head. Tennie was the one who approached me first. - Wow! - It was her idea to keep all of this a secret. Oh my God, you should write a book about it. You can deny it all you want but it happened. Listen, kid, you can say anything you want. I stand by my daughter. Regardless of how many stories you can come up with, the last words that matters are hers. I believe her. Now get that through your head. Michelle, let's go. That's what I'm talking about. That was pretty cool, I have to admit. Yeah, kind of was, wasn't it? That's my dad. I don't think that works. - We're here. - Hi. - Hi. Is... - She's up by the pool, Mr. Grigorian. Thank you, Laurie. It's Laura, Sir. Laura, yes. - Where do you think you are going? - What? Tennie. Before you say anything, just listen, okay? I'm not perfect and I know I haven't been the best father to you. I admit that. You had told me the other day not to lie to you anymore, but the problem was I have been lying to myself this whole time. Sweetheart, the truth is when mom passed away I lost a huge part of myself. She was my everything. My biggest supporter. Everything I achieved in this country was because of her. And when she got sick, I stopped, I stopped everything. I used every ounce of what I had to save her, but I couldn't. And when she died, drinking became my escape. And I work and work to provide you with everything you could ever want. Tennie, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I was selfish. All I've done is push you away. Sweetie, if you wanna drive your mom's old car, I understand. If you wanna stay in the same house with all the memories, you got it. If you want to go to Berkeley instead of UCLA, I support you. And I promise you, I promise you I will get the help I need. I want to be the father that you deserve, someone you could be proud of. I've already lost your mother, and God knows I'm not gonna lose you, too. I have something to tell you but I'm scared. No, sweetie. Don't ever be scared, okay? You can tell me anything. You know that argument you had with Jason? It's true. I slept with him. I never planned to do it. Being with him, for the first time... I felt special. God. You know being loved and cared for like that, I wanted to do everything to not lose that relationship. So that night in the heat of the moment I gave in. And... and I know that it meant nothing to him and it meant everything to me. God. I'm so hurt and I feel empty and- and I felt so ashamed. Don't be ashamed. Don't be. Don't say that. Dad, you got this, come on. Phew! Let's do it. It hurts. I got it. - This one, too? - Yeah, all of them. Food is here. Sorry it took so long. Yeah, of course, Laura had to get her cranberry quinoa bullshit. Oh, I'm so sorry, Uncle Robert. - What is that? - This? Oh, it's iced tea and it's none of that flavored crap. Oh, I'm so sorry again. This is what you should be drinking. Do you want to try some? Yeah, sure. - Why are they texting me? - What's up? Michelle, why are half the guys in school texting me to ask if you've- Thank you. ...decided about prom yet? What? Sorry. It's very good, healthy. - From Europe? - Try it again. Again? Today? Okay. I haven't decided yet. It's in two days. Aren't I gonna meet your mystery date in a couple of days? Yeah. All right, then. Tennie, who is taking my daughter to prom? So, I do have a guy in mind. You do? Good. All right. But there's a tiny problem. Problem? What problem? - It's kind of your fault. - My fault? No. Come on, who is the guy? It's Jack. No! Not him. Please. No way. Come on. Dad, you fired him. What do you mean I fired him? Come on, I did it for you. - What did I do? - Because... I had to get your attention somehow. Okay, okay, you got my attention. Now what? Have him ask me out to prom. No! I can't do that. Come on! Come on, dad. What are you... oh no. Jack. Are you willing to trade all the days from this day to the next for a chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives but they can never take our freedom? Oh-God. So, how did you find me? Oh, Daniella. Daniella said that you are in this performance? Well, obviously, you didn't come for my acting. It was good. It was good. Really? What... what was... what was your favorite part? Yeah, I... I would say the- the speech, the yelling, I mean the... the part that you delivered. Yep. And? And it was a... How would I say... emotional, it was emotional and powerful. What you did back there, it was powerful. And, listen, Di Caprio, I can't do this, okay? I'm here for Tennie. Okay, I stayed away from her just like you wanted me to. I kept my promise. I protected her. I even punched that asshole in the face for spreading rumors about her. - You did? - Yeah. Why do you think they returned your check? They did? Come on. Why are you really here? Prom, right? There is a prom? Wait till you see the dress... You'll thank me later, okay? - Are they here yet? - Wow, you're gorgeous. Just like your mother. Dad? Beautiful. I can't... Oh my God, it's time, they're here! Come on, sweetie. My God, so excited. - Okay, ready? Pose. - Is this good? Here we go. You're so cute. My lady. After you, Michelle. - Thanks, Aunt Melanie. - You'll love Tennie. - She is awesome. - Let me help you out. - Oh my God, Ten, you look so beautiful! - You look really good. Excuse me. Michelle, look over here honey. Is this good? Do I look good? Oh! Thank you. Here we go. - Quite a heavy hand. - Tennie, this is Rachel. So you're the Tennie I've heard so much about. I hope not everything. It's nice to finally meet you. Michelle, where is Jack? He said he's not coming with us. - What? - Who is Jack? - Oh my. - What did you just say?
