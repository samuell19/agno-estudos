Johnny: I was leaving home for the first time, 18 and off on my own. Leaving wasn't easy. I'm Johnny Palmer, and that's my dad, Tom. It was the summer, I met my grandfather, Jack Palmer, for the first time he lived on a ranch in Wyoming. No one had heard from him in 30 years. Dad never talked about him. But I knew a little from stories I had heard. He was a mysterious part of my life. What I didn't know was why dad hated him so. [Knock on door] Hi, doc. Wendell, I got some bad news on Jack. I've just got the lab reports back. How bad? Real bad. Come in. Jack, this is it. Excuse times are over. I'm not suggesting anymore. I'm telling you. Let a good surgeon operate or you're dead man. Quacks! Always trying to scare you. Now you listen, Jack. What are the odds living through a thing like this? Good. How good? Well, you've let it go a long time too long. If you're lucky you'll make it, if you get the treatment. How much longer? We can fly you to L.A. tomorrow. Not tomorrow. I appreciate your concern, doc. I'll need some more time. You want to tell me why? It's personal. Dying isn't? Okay. How long? A week. Okay. A week from today. I'll make the appointment. Here. Those will help you with the pain. Wendell, if you don't wanna lose a good foreman, you be sure he doesn't back outta this again. What're you gonna do, Jack? Go to L.A. You gonna make a stop in Santa Barbara? If they're there, I've gotta find them. And try to make up for what I did or didn't do. 30 years is a long time. You need some money? No. I got enough. How much is that? Jack? Well, I've been saving. And the pick-up's paid for. Well, I guess I don't have to say this, but whatever happens down in Santa Barbara, you always have a place here. Thanks. You take care of yourself. Can we go fishing, dad? Sure. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Promise? Promise. Goodnight, dad. Goodnight, son. Hey, Palmer! You want some fish? Johnny: Dad loved the sea, fished out of Santa Barbara, on the genoa, an old boat that had definitely seen better days. But it was dad's life. He liked being the captain of his own ship. Summers, I would work on the genoa, keeping it running. What's wrong? What isn't? Fuel line, it was dripping on the manifold. Oh, great! It needs to be replaced, I think we can make it home though. Wait a minute! We're losing money. We got bills to pay, too. You'll get your share, Jerry. How if we don't catch fish? And you don't fix this boat? Okay, dad, try it. Okay, let's bring in the net. Hey, give me a hand over here. Somebody bring a wrench. It's getting late. I got fish to buy. They'll be here. Will they have anything? Everybody's getting savick's best catch. Who do you want to do business with? You and Tom. I'm sorry. Tomorrow maybe. Savick! Where've you been? You're almost too late. What you got? Very little. -I'll take it. -You got it. Hey, Johnny boy! Hey, reg. Come on over! How's it going, guys? Hi, mom. -I'll be back in a bit, dad. -Alright. How'd you do? I hope the cat's not too hungry. Well... That's it. What do you mean "that's it?" You read it, they're gonna repossess the boat. No, they're threatening to repossess. Talk to them. Again? Hey, it's no big deal. Everybody's late. 5 months? -I know, I know. -Mike, phone call! Ask him about the engine. Hey Mike! Yeah? You still have that rebuilt engine for sale? Yeah, 8 thou cash. You're a real sweetheart, aren't you Mike? Look, like I've been telling you, I buy your boat and you come work for me I'll even make genoa the flagship and you can be captain. You've gotta be kidding. Think it over. You'd work for that? If I have to. I'm telling you Johnny boy, you've never seen such beauty. The tropics. Islands, reefs... You scuba? You'll learn. It's incredible water, like glass. And warm! You stay in it all day. Fish like you've never seen. Then at night, lying on the beach drinking palm wine feeling the sea breezes. Do you ever go into the outback? Me? Mining for opals. Now there's adventure. Or in new Guinea, in jungles so remote there's still cannibals. Truth, I'm telling you, Charlie boy, it's a chance of a lifetime. So what do you say? Don't I wish. Come on! We need a deck hand. I've spoken to the captain. I gotta work for my dad. Captain says in 5 days from tomorrow. Hey, Johnny! I gotta go. Don't take it out on him, okay? I gotta go help Betty. Thanks, Betty, I'll take over the cash register. Let's see...$5.08. Thank you. Yeah? Stay away from that guy, okay? Why? Because everybody around here knows he's a bum. He's a friend. If you're thinking of taking off with him, forget it. You don't want me to. You're going to college, not wasting your life at sea. Like you have? As a matter of fact. Make sure those guys finish their work. Does the ehlers family still live here? Does the ehlers family still live here? The ehlers? They haven't lived here since the old man went broke. You know where they moved to? No idea. Thanks. How long will you be staying, Mr. Palmer? I can't say. You got a phone book handy? Thank you. I guess I'll be staying awhile. Here's a beauty. Why don't you pick this one? [Telephone rings] I won't be a minute. Why don't you pick the ones you wanna buy? [Ring] Yes? Sal? Who is this? This is Jack. Jack? Jack who? Jack Palmer. Sal? Jack? I'm sorry to call you up, but... Where are you? I'm at a payphone down on state street. Here? In Santa Barbara? I'm staying at the westwind. I thought maybe... What do you want? To see you, sal. And Tom. Why? It's kinda hard to talk about on the phone. After 30 years, you call me because you want to visit? Sal... I don't think so. Good-bye. Hello, sal. Can we hold this reunion someplace other than a parking lot? Thanks for coming. -I almost didn't. -Why did you? I couldn't let history repeat itself. For years, I've been practicing all the things I'd say if you showed up. Go ahead. Don't you dare humor me. Don't come back here pretending nothing happened. I'm sorry. You should be. You left with a note taped to the refrigerator. I just didn't wanna fight anymore. "I love you, I'll send for you and Tom." I did. All I got back were divorce papers. What did you expect me to do? Expected that you loved me enough to leave. You didn't love me enough to stay. I couldn't stay. I couldn't leave! That's not true. I could've followed you, I didn't have the courage. When I finally did get up the nerve, my letters came back, you were gone. I'm the one who should be sorry. For not having guts enough to stick it out. How could we have done that? I spent a lot of nights wondering. So now, what? Well, I just thought that maybe... What? We could spend some time together. That's Tom, of course. Well, he turned out okay. Johnny, your grandson. Grandson? Yeah, he looks like me. His mother? Gwen. What's she like? Strong, with a mind of her own. My kind of woman. What do you want, Jack? To see you and Tom. -Why now? -Why not? Why not years ago, when it would've meant something? Years ago, I wasn't ready. Well, Tom still isn't. He's bitter. What do you expect? Well, it's been a long time. Some wounds don't heal. He never understood your leaving or accepted it. I doubt he'd be enthusiastic about a casual visit from dad. It's not casual. Then what is it? Sal, I need your help. I've got a lot to make up for and... Not much time. I didn't say that. What's wrong, Jack? Nothing. Can't you at least tell me the truth? I don't want pity. From me? I gotta go into the hospital. -When? -Next week. -For what? -It doesn't matter. What matters is all those nights I've laid awake in strange beds wondering how life turned out the way it did, remembering how it might have been. Trying to get up the guts after all these years to do something, to make it up to you and Tom, to be a father once before-- Jack, being a father it's not a casual visit, it's a lifetime. I'll give it all I got left. Sal, you will help me. Not tell him or anyone about me. If he hates me, I'd rather hear him say it than be polite. Because I'm sick. How sick? I'll be alright. Sal? I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer, with your current debt load, I'm afraid it's just not possible. It's a catch-22 Mr. Ames. We can't pay what we need to on the loan unless we fish. We can't fish unless we get the genoa running. I sympathize, Mrs. Palmer. Really I do. I can tell. A rebuilt engine costs 8,000, you're asking for 20. The engine's not our only problem, just the worst. The fish finder and auto-pilot, 3,300. The tail shaft and prop, 2,500. 5,600 for dry dock and haul repair. $19,400 that's what I need to put the genoa into top shape. Well, have you considered that fixing it may be more trouble than it's worth. I'm a fisherman, the genoa's my livelihood. I can't see how you can compete with savick's fleet size. Hasn't he made an offer? I think we're wasting our time. Why not? No way. But it's only a house. And the genoa's only a boat. We've lived there for years. You loved that house. Your grandfather willed you that boat I know how much it means to you. Look this house is community property. I wanna sell my half and put the proceeds into fixing the boat. -I told you-- -you told me? Hey, we're discussing this, right? And that means we both have open minds, I hope. Gwen, I'm selling the boat. Over my dead body. Hopefully not? We'll sell the house. -And live where? -We can rent or lease somewhere. Honey, it's not that simple. It is. I might as well take Mike's offer. You don't wanna work for anyone else? I haven't exactly been a success on my own. You are twice the sailor Mike is. Everybody knows the genoa's the problem. Maybe I should just get a job. Doing what? Whatever I have to do to meet my responsibilities. You mean me. And Johnny. You're not responsible for me or Johnny. Yes, I am. Look, will you at least agree to list the house? I don't want to see you sell that boat. -Okay. -Alright. Who knows, we could get a fabulous offer for it. What time will you be in? -I don't know. -Have a good time. You're really gonna sell the boat? -Looks like it. -Or the house what do you think? I think dad should do whatever he wants, everybody should. He's growing up. Hey, is that Johnny? Daddy wants to say hello. Good to see ya. Where you been keeping yourself? Libby here's been dying of loneliness -dad! -Out on the boat. That's what I like a man unafraid of hard work. You think you could our girl here some lessons? She studied pretty hard, Wilson. She graduated. You both deserve that trip to Hawaii. You packed yet? She tell you we're taking the company jet, all first class. That's a great present, Mr. Wilson. We're staying a week on kauai. It is gonna be so great. Know what I got for high school graduation? Good-bye, daddy. Alright, have fun. Next week, hula hula. Hawaii! Did I tell you who else is coming? Susan and Jeff, oh, and Annie and Jim. And no hotel either. Daddy rented this condo right on the beach. And no dorms either I told him we needed our privacy. So we've all got private rooms. Oh, it's gonna be so wonderful. What's wrong? You never invited me. What do you mean I never invited you ? You just assumed I'd go. 'Course I assumed you'd go. What do you need, a formal invitation? We're not exactly strangers, you know. Alright. Miss Elizabeth Wilson requests the pleasure of Mr. John Palmer's company on the island of kauai. Johnny, did I do something? It's not you. Well, what then? My dad's selling his boat. I can sail on the gallant. How long will you be gone? I don't know. 6 months, a year maybe. Libby, don't cry. What about US? I mean, not just the trip, but later. Don't make it worse than it already is. I love you. I love you. Do you? Libby. Who is it? It's some kid. That's not a kid. That's our boy. The one with the boat. Him? Be nice. Johnny boy. When you said you lived in a stable, you meant it. Well, the price is right. Rent it from the gallant's owner. Meet Ralph and Jeff, stable hands John Palmer, fisherman. -Hey, not for long. -Huh? Yeah, my dad's gonna sell the boat. I can go. That's great. I thought you could introduce me to the captain sometime. That's a good idea. Except, do you have enough money? Money? I thought I was gonna crew. You are, and the crew gets food, transportation and some money, but it's not much, and it's not enough. Enough for what? Well, travel, living expenses, if you decide to stay someplace or bid a stake till you get a job. How much do you think I'll need? -1,000 should do. -1,000? You could do with less but it's dicey. -How much you got? -A couple hundred. You interested in making some more? Of course, how? How's the genoa running? So-so. Can we take her out? I don't know if my dad will let me. He'd let you check the engine. That's all we're going to do. Come on. This rich Mexican worked his boat down in acapulco. Ever been there? It's fabulous. He's moving to the states of Santa Barbara. And he's got this collection of pre-Colombian art the government won't let him take it outta the country. So? Said he'll pay US good money to help him. Take the genoa out, pick up a box off another boat, deliver it on shore. Why doesn't the other boat just bring it in? Coast guard they won't bother your boat. It sounds illegal. Well, it is illegal, but who does it hurt? He didn't steal the art. He's just trying to keep what belongs to him. I'd do the same thing. Yeah, but smuggling. I don't know. It's a victimless crime, nobody gets hurt, and he'll pay good money. $1,000? Two, one for you one for me. Okay, I'll meet you tomorrow night. Well, let me know. Ma'am. See you, mate. Yeah? What were you doing? We were taking the genoa to check the engine. Reg is a good mechanic. Does your father know? Do I need his permission for everything? -Hey! -Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! I got to go. Will you listen to your father? Johnny, be careful of that guy. Hi. Hi. Libby, I'm sorry. I'm trying to understand. I've got to live my own life, lib. You don't have to sail halfway around the world to do that. I don't have to, I want to. To get away from me. No. Libby. My dad went to the army, before he got married and he came back. But I don't want you to go. I even talked dad into letting me go to the same college with you. I want to do that too, just not yet. Don't you care anything about US? You know I do. Caring about US, doesn't stop me from being who I am. You know what I think? You're mad at your dad because he's trying to run your life and you're taking it out on me. Johnny: Maybe Libby was right. But I couldn't talk about this with my dad. We could never get through to each other. Thought graduating from high school would make a difference but there was this wall between US. Sure hope you guys are hungry. But first, if you don't mind a little formality. A toast to the graduates. Congratulations. And here's something I think you'll be able to use. Dad. It's not everyday that someone in this family wins a science prize. And earns a master scholarship. What did you get? A computer. Whichever one you want. Dad, you can't afford this. We all chipped in. The payments aren't very much. I consider it an investment for your future. Tom, can I speak to you? Sure. Privately. We won't be long. Is something wrong? No. Why? Nothing. You guys don't seem your usual selves. I'm fine. How about you? I'm okay. Okay. What's the big secret? Tom... What's the matter, mom? I've got something to tell you, I don't know how. Trouble? I hope not. The only way to tell you, is to tell you. I've heard from your father. Where is he? Here. In Santa Barbara? You've seen him? He wants to talk to you. What about? Perhaps you should ask him that yourself. Why did you do this? Because I thought it was important. Because I knew you'd never go to see him on your own. Tom, at least talk to him. Yeah, sure. Why not? Good to see you. I don't believe this. It's been a long time. Too long. What do you want? I thought we'd just get together and talk. You gotta be kidding. Tom, if you change your mind, I'm at the westwind. Who is that guy? Your grandfather. Johnny: There he was, the mystery man. He'd come back. Suddenly, I knew our lives were going to change. Tom. Tom! What is wrong with you? I can't believe my mother setting me up like this. Would you have seen him if she hadn't? Why should I? -Why not? -What? And let him walk out of our lives again? You mean, he just walked out? That's what dad says. Deserted his own family? I don't know about deserted. He was gone for 30 years that sounds like desertion to me. He didn't seem like a bad guy to me. You're defending him? You're accusing him. Maybe he just wanted to see the world. Maybe he did. Oh, Johnny. Look, you don't know why he left. Do you? [Knock on door] Johnny. How you doing? Okay. Libby? She's fine. Hey, we're proud of you. I want you to know that. Thanks. Just keep plugging away, huh? There's nothing you won't be able to accomplish. Yeah. -Goodnight, son. -Goodnight. -Dad. -Yeah? What's he like? Who? Grandpa. Don't ask. Yeah, but you talked to him. We exchanged some words, that's all. Is he going to be around a while? Goodnight, son. Johnny: I wonder why he came in to see me? What did he really want to say? Maybe he wanted to talk about grandpa and couldn't do it. Why is it hard to show how we feel? I know we love each other, but keep it to ourselves. We make a secret of our feelings. Was grandpa like that too? How did they get along together? They must have loved each other once. Tom. My legacy. All that he left when he walked out of our lives. You want to call him? And say what? Welcome home? Aren't you curious? What gives him the right to just show up after 30 years? He's your father. Biologically. He wants to talk to you. No way. Tom, you were 10 years old. The night before he left... He came to my room just before I went to sleep. And I asked him, "can we go fishing?" He said, "sure." "Promise?" "Promise." The next day he was gone. Why? Why did he leave me? Ask him. Jack Palmer's room, please. [Ring] Hello. You said you wanted to get together and talk? Tom, I'm glad you called. How about tomorrow morning at 9:00 at the boat? Tomorrow? You're not fishing? It's Sunday. Oh, yeah. For a minute there I forgot. -9:00. -I'll be there. Tom, I really appreciate your-- Mr. Palmer! Uh, excuse me. I'm Gwen, Tom's wife. I'm pleased to meet you. And this is Johnny. -I've heard a lot about you. -Me too! I don't doubt that. Dad's down on the boat. Thanks. This is so great. Good morning. Come aboard. You stay here. Why can't I come? -Do as I tell you get the line. -Aye-aye, captain. You're as smooth with old genoa as your grandpa ehlers. I learned a lot from him. I don't doubt that. He treated me like a son. Yeah, I guess I've got a lot to answer for. What do you want? To see you and your mother and now my grandson. You can forget that. Is that why you wouldn't let Johnny come along? Haven't you done enough damage? My share, I guess. I'd like to do what I can to make up for it. What are we supposed to do let bygones be bygones? Well, I can't say I'd mind. Where the hell do you get off-- I was going to say that's a lot to expect. Then don't. Tom, son-- don't call me that. You have no right to call me that. Do you know how old I am? 10, end of summer. And I'm getting out my fishing rods and yours too. And every day I'd take 'em up on the creek 'cause I know, I just know that afternoon I'll turn around and you'll be there. Only you never were, were you? Why? Why did you do it? I guess I could tell you about my run in with old man ehlers. You left because of your father-in-law? It was more personal than that. He was my father. He was a tyrant. You wore the livery or he broke you. Not the man I knew. Tom, all that... That was an explanation, that's all. Not an excuse. There is no excuse. At the time, leaving seemed... Well, I always did have a hot head. That was wrong. I guess, I've known that for years. Why it took me all this time to get up the nerve to tell you and your mother that, I wish I knew. I've nothing to offer except an apology. Long overdue. There's nothing I want except the chance for US all to get to know each other again. I won't interfere. I'm not going to be around long enough for that anyways. So you have nothing to fear there. But Johnny's the only grandson I've got. And I wouldn't mind getting to know your Gwen, too. Who knows? Maybe you and me getting to know each other, too. That it? I don't figure there's much any of US can do about the past. Okay, you've had your say, here's mine. I don't care why you left I don't even care why you came back. We managed without you for 30 years, we can get along without you now. Johnny: I couldn't imagine dad being so angry for 30 years that he wouldn't forgive his own father. When grandpa put his pride aside and took a chance coming back, you'd think dad would bend a little. Dad must have been feeling more pain inside from all those years than anyone could've imagined. What was stopping him from forgiving grandpa? Hey, mom, they're coming in. Johnny, not now. Not much of a reconciliation, huh? What happened? The past just caught up with US, Johnny. Hey, Mr. Palmer, wait up! Where you going? Back to the hotel. Okay if I come along? Sure. You want a lift? No. I'll meet you there. Mind if I ask? Ask away. Where were you? Well, in the early days, I roughnecked in the oil fields. Traveled around a lot. -That's what I'd like to do. -It's a hard life. What do you do now? I run a ranch for a friend of mine. What about you? What do you like to do? Sail. I saw pictures at your grandmother's house. You and your dad looked pretty good. Yeah, for a while. You got a girl? Libby. Serious? -Too serious. -Oh. Yeah, I got this chance to crewing on a boat to Australia. Only she wants me to go on this vacation to Hawaii with her. Her dad's really rich and he's paying for it. That sounds familiar. Then we were supposed to go to college together. -You don't want to? -Oh, eventually. I'm tired of everybody planning my life for me. I wanna do things on my own. I got this math scholarship. And dad thinks I'd be really irresponsible if I don't go to college now. Libby even changed schools so we could be together. Sounds like you're really involved. Yeah. Obligations do have a way of sneaking up on a fella. What would you do? If you were me. I think I'd do my traveling before I got committed. Fewer people will get hurt. Yeah, that's what I think. If only I could convince dad. Talk to him. I can't. Not like I can with you. Why not? Let's just say we don't see eye to eye. Yeah, I can understand that. Johnny, it's been great getting a chance to know you. Same here, Mr. Palmer. What's this Mr. Palmer? I'm your grandfather, right? Right... Grandpa. He'd kill me if he knew that I told you but I had to. We've gotta stop him. Can I give you some advice? If he wants to go, you can't hold on. Why now, when everything's so wonderful? To you. He says he loves me. Oh, Libby, when I was your age, I met Tom. And we fell in love. We even talked about getting married. But Tom wanted to enlist in the army. Which is funny 'cause I was against the war. Anyway, he was gone 2 years, and I went out with other boys. When he came back, we were total strangers. But we fell in love all over again. Johnny is not gonna forget you. I won't let him. Jack, I'm glad you came. I couldn't leave without saying good-bye. Gwen told me what happened. You were right, he doesn't want anything to do with me. At the moment. The way he's feeling I don't see him changing his mind soon. So you're leaving again? Well, there's no point in hanging around here. Did you think it was going to be easy? What about me? After nearly 30 years don't I deserve more than a hello, good-bye? Tom needed you when he was a boy and you weren't there. Now, he needs you again. He could've fooled me. All his life Tom has tried to be responsible and upright. All the things he thought you weren't. Now he's smothering his son. If he can come to terms with you, he can let go of Johnny. Otherwise, they'll end up strangers like you and Tom. Jack, if you really came back to heal things, don't run away now. They both need you. I'd like to believe that. Then do. -He's here, right? -Tom, I want you to come inside. This what you meant by important? -I heard about this morning. -From him. Before you get defensive-- mom, you're not gonna change my mind. If you put aside your pride and listen to what we have to say. -We? -Grow up, Tom. There are 2 sides to every story. I'm sorry, Jack. Well, thanks for trying. You're telling me to grow up? You're acting like a child throwing yourself at a man who deserted you. -He didn't desert. -Yes, I did. You're sorry. He left, mom. That's all that matters. Don't you want to know why? Blaming grandpa is no excuse. But he was to blame, at least in part. -There's no point to this. -Will you shut up and listen? To what? The two of you tearing down the only father I knew. I loved him too, Tom. But he wasn't perfect. When we married, I wasn't even 18 I left his house and thought I'd be free. But I wasn't. Not really. How could I be free and let him drive away my husband and turned you into unforgiving-- how can I forgive him? 'Cause if you don't, you'll wish you had for the rest of your life. -I'll survive. - Yes, that's all you'll do. Tom, if Jack hadn't had the courage to come back I'd be living with the guilt of what I did. He's the one who threw US away. I wrote asking you to come, at least visit. Then, how come I never got the letters? Because I was so angry, so terribly angry, I threw them away. I'm sorry. Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? You're making a smart move, Palmer. Tom, business is a pain in the neck. Banks, payrolls, IRS-- let me worry about that. You just keep doing what you do best, catch fish. Lots of fish. Tons of fish. Now what I want you to do is keep going out till I find a slip for you with my boats. Come on, captain. Take the day off. Celebrate. Johnny, going to eat dinner? I'm going out. Like that? -Libby likes it. -What do her parents think? No more than mine did when you were into bells and beads? -That was different. -How? I was going out with a flower child. Don't be late, okay? Why? Going fishing tomorrow. Thought you were gonna sell the boat? -I did. -You what? -Well, that makes it easy. -What do you mean? When the gallant sails, I'm gone. Like hell you are. -I'm 18, dad. -I don't care if you're 40. -You have a scholarship. -I'm taking the year off. No, you're not! -Hold it, Tom-- -you have responsibilities. -Obligations. -I don't want them. Don't want them? Not yet. I got to live my own life. Like grandpa says it's better to leave before it's too late. -Grandpa? -Yeah, grandpa. -You know nothing about him. -Neither do you. What right does he have to interfere? I had already made up my mind. -Then unmake it. -I'm going. Go to your room! To my room? Who do you think you're talking to some 10-year-old? You don't run my life. Not anymore. Can't you get that through your head? -Come back here! -Let him go. Johnny! Tom! You sold the boat? I've got a buyer for the house. How much longer do we have to wait? Keep watching for the lights. We've been waiting a couple of hours. Look, they'll be here. There! That's it. Good work, Johnny boy. Here you go. Come on. Take it. So did you get 'em? Right here. It's all there. It'll cost you 3 extra. That wasn't our deal. Extra expenses. I'll just hold on to this. I'll call the police. Feel free. I'll get the money. You've got 2 days, or I find another buyer. Those don't belong to a collector. You stole them. Keep your mouth shut! We have confirmation from your bank in Wyoming, Mr. Palmer. -They told you I'm good for it? -Yes, sir. They asked US to remind you this $20,000 withdrawal will close out your account. Oh, that's alright. How would you like this? Cashier's check, please. [Doorbell rings] You won't be needing this. Mr. Palmer. May I come in? Sure. -Nice place. -Thanks. I'm waiting for a buyer. Can I get you a cup of coffee? That'd be nice. Um, cream? Sugar? No, just black is fine. Tom's had those for a long time. Yes, I remember. It's the last thing I gave him, except some promises. Uh, Mr. Palmer... -Jack. -Jack. I'm sorry things didn't work out. I won't apologize for Tom. There's no need. I see someone like him every morning in the mirror when I shave. So I understand. Both stubborn. In fact, that's why I'm here-- I got a favor to ask you. I'd really appreciate it if you'd accept this. This is a lot of money. It's yours. Ha ha ha! What's funny? Oh. I was just thinking... Last week, we were broke. And now Tom's selling the boat for me. I'm selling the house for him. And you're trying to give US this. If we're not careful, we'll be rich. Somehow I have the feeling that being rich isn't what you want. You're right. It'll let you keep the house and help fix the boat. I'm sorry. I can't accept that. Why not? Well, we could use the money, but the way Tom feels... You wanna know what I'm really feeling right now? I ran out before I could give my son much. Looking back, I have a lot of regrets. I'd give him my life but he wont take that. I know that money is a poor substitute but it's all I got, so please take it, for Tom. He won't accept it. Don't tell him where it's from. I can't do that. Wait till I've gone. It's true. We do have financial problems right now, but... We're going to survive. It's not a matter of life or death. It is for me. Hey, Johnny boy. How are you, partner? Come on in. Have something wet. Beer? No. Thanks. A soft drink? No. Well, what is it you want, Johnny boy? Not this. Noble. -You lied to me. -Yes, I did. I wanna apologize about that I should've told you. I wouldn't have done it. -Really? -Come on, reg, we're friends. I see, and you want to clean this blot off our relationship? We're gonna be spending lots of time together on the gallant. No, we're not. See, with this... I'm through taking orders. It's my turn to give some. -Why don't you give it back? -Give it back! You must be joking. To whom? What's he doing here? Well, he wants US to give the stuff back. Have you told anybody about this? Not yet. Don't Mark him. I told you he's sick. How sick? He was in bed when I got home yesterday. Still there when there's work. Come on. Lay off. First time in weeks we catch fish, and where's Johnny? Hey, captain! Where's the rest of the crew? [Knock on door] It's open. No fishing today? Sure, I guess. I'm taking the day off. Thought I'd come by and see how you're doing. Looks like I'm the one who should be asking you that. Got in a fight, huh? How did you know? I've been in enough of 'em myself. When I see a man holding himself like he might break, I remember the feeling. Painful. Yeah. What was it about? Well, whoever did it didn't Mark your face, how come? Hey, there. No shame crying. There's this guy who's gonna get me on the boat to Australia, he said I needed $1,000 for expenses. And he knew how to get it. Yeah. Some antique statues. Stolen? When I tried to tell him to give 'em back-- they gave it to you. How many guys? 3. How much time we got? Not much. I guess I better go. No, no, stay put. I'm thinking. Did you talk to your dad? No, he'd kill me. I've got an idea, before we get into it, talk to him so he won't think we're going behind his back, okay? What's the idea? Will you talk to him? What if he says no? Then we'll take care of it ourselves. How? Pay your friends a visit. I already tried that. Yeah, but you've gotta be persuasive. Johnny: I took grandpa's advice and hoped he was right. I guess I realized it'd be a test of how dad and I felt as father and son. Not that I expected much but-- I was hoping dad would finally hear me. What do you want me to say? You broke the law, risked your future, and our reputation but hey that's okay. -No. -That I understand? -I know better than that. -Then what? I almost wish you hadn't told me. Yeah, so do I. You've never made it easy, have you? You're the one who said we never had much in common. -We used to. -When I was 10. If you're talking about sailing you're the one who quit. You sold my boat without telling me. You lost interest. How would you know? You never asked. You didn't know the boat was gone for weeks. I was so mad I couldn't talk. Well, you got the money. I didn't want the money. I wanted to sail. Then why did you quit? Because you did. [Engine coughs] Check the fuel line. I want to finish this. It is finished. We're going to the police. We don't have to. I talked to grandpa. You talked to him about this? Why not? I'm your father. Hey, captain. The engine. Who told you to quit working? [Engine sputters] You want to say something to me? Come on, bud. Get to work. Get the fire extinguisher! Johnny, get the radio, call in the mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. This is the vessel genoa. Whiskey Charlie 2191. We're on fire. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Genoa, genoa, this is coast guard 1011. We have copied your mayday. Do you know your position? Over. Come on, Sally. Be home. Genoa, we are not receiving you. Sally, this is Gwen. There's a mayday on the genoa. I don't know. I'm gonna go to the coast guard station. I'll meet you there. [Siren] Get the jackets! Jerry! We're going to die. Jerry! Give me a hand! Help Jerry get his vest on. Careful, he's panicked. Dad! Did you grab the fuel line. Go! Help! Help! Look out for bud, he's panicked. Help! Dad! Come on, dad! Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. This is the genoa, whiskey Charlie 2191. We're on fire and abandoning ship. Our position is 5 miles south of Santa Barbara point. I repeat. Mayday! Mayday! May-- dad! Dad! Coast guard station channel islands, this is coast guard gila-1456 we've sighted debris and oil floating 5 miles south of Santa Barbara point. We request assistance from coast guard cutter point bridge in search for the crew. Over. Coast guard gila-1456, this is cutter point bridge. We will proceed to your location at once. Over. Coast guard cutter point bridge, we will maintain position until your arrival. Over. Jack? Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Pain? Some. Some? Tell me the truth. Dad! Dad! Where are you? [Helicopter approaches] Dad! This is coast guard gila-1456, we've located 4 crewmen. All appear conscious and safe with floatation. Over. Jack, Sally, they found them! Oh, thank god! The cutter's bringing them in now. You two okay? Fine. Make the bow line. Now, you've gotta see a doctor. -I'm going to. -When? The day after tomorrow in la. And then what? Well, that depends. Jack... Are you dying? I don't know. You've gotta let me tell Tom. Sal, you promised. If we can't get along, that's just the way things are. I don't want him changing his mind out of pity. That's not what I'm looking for. Sal? Put over 3. Take the flag out of 4. Ooh, I was so scared. So were we. I love you guys so much. Are bud and Jerry okay? Bud swallowed half the pacific but they're alright. -They're down below. -Well, let's get you two home. -I got something to do first. -What's that? -Go to the police. -There's another way. What do you mean? There's more to this than you realize. Somebody tell me what's going on? I'd like to talk to Tom and Johnny alone. Tom? Whatever it is, let them work it out. There are too many secrets going on around here. Which ones don't I know? He gave it to me, for Tom to fix up the boat. Said he wouldn't take no for an answer. But now the boats gone, so what do I do? There's something else we gotta do before we get the police involved. What? Get the stuff back, turn this guy reg in. Then the police will go easier on Johnny. You wanna take the law into your own hands? No, I'll go to the police. I just wanna square things first. That's not the way to do it. Dad, I've got to. You're on your own. Johnny: It wasn't easy, walking away from my dad like that. But grandpa made me feel like a man. I hoped dad understood. Because I had to go. Hey fellas...We got company. Hey, Johnny boy. Who's your friend? Is that the stuff? Yeah, that's it. Just put it down, Sonny. Hold it. I like these odds better. Thanks for dropping in. I didn't do it for you. No, I don't suppose you did. I guess I was right staying away. I wanted to come back for a long, long time. Then why didn't you? I was afraid. You, afraid? Of what? Of you. Afraid you wouldn't want me. I guess I should've listened to my intuition. -I'll see you, kid. -Thanks, grandpa. Johnny: Grandpa's walking away changed something in dad. When he saw I was gonna sail, he said he didn't want US to end up the same way as him and his father. I kept hoping he'd come to love and respect grandpa as I did. And that maybe he'd finally realize that no matter how much we hurt each other, we're still fathers and sons. This is all the money you've got, isn't it?. I sold my truck. That won't be enough to take care of you. Jack, you've gotta think about later-- keep it, sal, use it for our family. I can't let you go like this. I'll be alright. No, you won't. You'll be alone. Haven't you been alone long enough? -Sal, I don't belong here. -Because of Tom? Yes, but that's not all of it. Just the thought of being an invalid, being a burden on you, I've been no good to anybody after all these years. Still shot through with pride, aren't you, cowboy? I guess some things never change. We'll go slow, see what happens. Oh, Jack, let me take care of you, please. I can't, sal. But I love you. I love you, too. Well, at least let me come and sit with you. The bus doesn't go for a while. Good-bye, sal. Where is he? He's gone. Non-stop service to Los Angeles boarding at door number 4. Dad... I'll go with you.
