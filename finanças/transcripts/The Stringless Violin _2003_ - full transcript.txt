Did you know that baby Larasati passed away last night? Now, don't be sad. After all, death is part of life's journey. Everything that lives will eventually die... and every death will make us stronger. You're still too young to understand, but you need to know this fact. So, are you coming along to the funeral, or do you want to stay home? What will it be, Dewa? I love you, Dewa. ORPHANAGE After experiencing so many deaths, I thought I would get used to it. But it still hurts. The heart still aches. The heart is an indestructible puzzle. Sometimes it's strong. Sometimes it's vulnerable. Imagine how Gandari must have felt, burying her one hundred children who died on the battlefields of Kurusetra. BORN 10TH SEPTEMBER 2002 DIED 15TH SEPTEMBER 2002 Good boy. A little to the left. Yes. Straight ahead. Good boy. Yes. Dewa, wait here. Don't make a sound. Do you know where butterflies come from? The egg that their mother hatched becomes a caterpillar, like the ones you often see crawling on banana leaves. The caterpillar will then weave a cocoon, a home for it to sleep. After a while, it awakens and is ready to leave its home. But it has transformed. It will then appear as a beautiful butterfly. Isn't it beautiful? And it will fly away around the world. One day, you will also be able to fly away and see the world. Arrogance is a puzzle that is often misinterpreted. Does wealth breed arrogance or does arrogance breed wealth? What's the matter, Mbak Wid? Mrs. Mardi came to see me this morning. Isn't her husband with the Revenue Department? Yes. She came by to drop off a baby boy. She told me he was her friend's grandson. Same old story. A fatherless baby. Was the baby disabled? It was robust and healthy. I explained that we only accept babies born with multiple disabilities. She became furious. She said that we were ungrateful as she was willing to donate a lavish sum. Good boy, Dewa. You finished your dinner. My smart boy. Only smart little boys like you are welcome to live here. Children who have been discarded by their parents. Children who have brought shame to their families. Children with multiple disabilities. Children who are doomed to die. Hush, Mbak Wid. Dewa's here. Oh, Renjani. I know that you really love Dewa. But that child isn't listening. He doesn't understand a thing. Not only are his brain cells damaged, but he has autistic tendencies. His eyes are open but they do not see. His ears hear nothing. You've seen the results of his test. Those tests only prove his physical health. They don't tell us about his feelings. Feelings are indeed life's most complicated puzzle. When are we supposed to be annoyed? When are we supposed to be content? He looks like a gnome. Such a strange-looking face. He must be the ogre's son! Don't go anywhere, Dewa. Wait for me right here. Hey, wait! Hey! Wait! Do you have to insult him? Are you boys always this mean? You boys should know that not everybody is born without disabilities like you both. Try to respect those who are less fortunate than you are. Try to help them. Don't insult them. Please forgive us, ma'am. What's wrong with him? He was born with a disability that affects his brain. You shouldn't apologize to me but to him. His name is Dewa. Come, I'll introduce you to him. Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! Dewa! The beach felt so wide... and I felt so little. I walked, but my feet didn't touch the sand. My heart was about to explode. You said he was holding onto a shell? It must be his karma. Maybe it's a sign that he's in touch with the other world. Maybe in his previous life, he was born a shell. Mbak Wid, please. My mind was filled with horrible thoughts. I can't imagine what I would have done if I had lost him. I think you're too attached to that boy. Remember, he is a patient here. And... given his condition, you have to be prepared to lose him anytime. He is a patient, Renjani, not your son. Maybe he... he can replace the child that I lost. Child? You lost a child? He lived only in the corners of my womb. You never gave birth? Once, my life was dedicated only to dancing. I never thought about men or love. Did you get yourself pregnant? Was the baby fatherless? You got rid of your baby? You're crazy, Renjani. You had an abortion, didn't you? Didn't you, Renjani? Life is one big crazy puzzle! Come on, Mbak Wid. I know I did wrong. I am a sinner. I have committed many sins. Sin... This thing that you call sin... I was raised by it. Educated by it. I don't understand. Sin is the hardest puzzle to solve. The borderlines are deceptive. I thought... when I started working here... serving in your house, that I could pay for the sins of my past. Can anyone ever pay for their sins? God... God may forgive us. But we're mortal beings. How can we ever forget? The biggest sin to mankind was when Drupadi, wife of the Pandawas, was insulted... "WE WILL INVESTIGATE. THEN WE WILL KNOW WHERE THE PANDAWAS ARE HEADING." ...was stripped by Duryudana... AFTER THAT, THE TRIAL WAS DISMISSED. SRI KRESNA QUIETLY FOLLOWED ALONG BEHIND THEM. "SO IT IS HARDER TO FIND THEM, DON'T LET THEM KNOW WHERE THE PANDAWAS ARE." "LEAVE IMMEDIATELY." "HOW SHOULD WE DISGUISE OURSELVES, BROTHER?" My mother was a prostitute. Children can never choose who they want as parents. I never questioned or passed judgment. ABOVE THE JUNGLE, SOMEONE WAS SEEN FLOATING... My mother did all that... to raise me. To give me an education. "THEY MUST GO TO WIRATA." What hurt me most was that she would often get herself pregnant. One week, she would get an abortion. The next week, she would be working again. In all, I could have had six siblings. I vowed that I would become a pediatrician and dedicate myself to saving children's lives. Let my mother kill... my unborn siblings. Let me pay for her sins... by saving as many children as I can. I was forced to... I was forced... I was raped. Which evil man did that to you? My most trusted friend. He was my mentor. My ballet instructor. I love you, Dewa. Dewa, where are you? Dewa? Dewa? Do you like that slipper? It's called a ballet slipper. It once belonged to me. I once had dreams of becoming a ballerina. And I did become a ballerina. I performed several times. But something happened, and I had to give up my dancing dreams. When you're much older, I'll tell you about it. Dewa? Dewa, did you like my dance? You like seeing me dance? Oh, Dewa, I love you so much. Come on, Renjani. Pick seven cards. Mbak Wid, remember, you're reading Dewa's fortune. Dewa, do you want me to help you take seven cards? Are you sure Dewa lifted his head? Yes. I was happy to finally get a response from him. Could it be that in his previous life, he was born a musician or a dancer? Dancing or music, one or the other must be the therapy he needs. This card, the sun. This is a very good card. A deep scar is about to heal. Oh, prepare yourself. There will be a major change in your life. Did you hear that, Dewa? Your life is about to change. I've made a few calls to some friends asking about upcoming performances. I'm planning to take Dewa to see one. You've got to open your mind. Try to accept new thoughts. There's one tomorrow evening. A string recital by students from the music academy. I'm taking Dewa. Do you care to join us? There's love. This card reads that you are about to discover true love. Dewa, don't you want to go home? It's getting late. We'll have trouble going home. Do you want me to carry you? Come on. Is everything all right? I'm Bhisma. I'm Renjani. This is my brightest boy, Dewa. Dewa, say hello to Bhisma. Can Dewa speak at all? He's always been mute. He has a disability that affects the brain. I took him here tonight because I thought that music might be the therapy he needs. Dewa, please return it. It's not yours. Come on, Dewa, Bhisma's going to be mad at you. Do you like the bow? If so, you can hold onto it. But let's go home now. Come. Come on. Come on, Dewa. Thank you. It was very kind of you to drive us home. Right. Dewa, it's time to return the bow to Bhisma. Come on, Dewa. That's all right. Let him keep the bow tonight. I'll come back for it tomorrow morning. Okay, Dewa. Keep it for me, but don't lose it. All right? Okay? Okay. Good night, Bhisma. Good night. I love you very much, Dewa. I moved here from Jakarta. On the train, I sat next to a lady with her baby. I noticed the baby was handicapped. I found out that the baby wasn't hers. She was on an errand to get rid of the baby in Yogya. I inherited this house from my grandmother. At first, I didn't know what to do with a house this huge. Then I remembered the lady on the train. I turned this house into a home for unwanted babies, but only babies with multiple disabilities. And Dewa? You're his mother? Where is his father? No, I'm not his biological mother. Dewa was brought here when he was two days old. I don't know who his parents are. How old is he now? He'll be eight next month. Madam, it's Dewa! Dewa! What happened? You must wait for me here. - What happened? - There. What happened to you? It isn't serious. Just a minor burn. He touched the burner in the kitchen. My poor baby, does it hurt much? Does it hurt, poor baby? Bhisma, you're not supposed to be here. Wait for me in my office. Bhisma, this isn't a public place. This is baby Cempaka. She was found by a beggar abandoned on the riverbank and brought here. NAME: LARASATI AGE, This is baby Rama. He's deaf and has hydrocephalus. Please don't touch his head. He will probably only have one year to live. Bhisma, this is Mbak Wid. She's the head pediatrician here. My cards never lie. Blow out the candles Right now Cut the cake Right now - Who gets the first piece? - Dewa. Dewa, of course. ...but I'm not after the degree. After all, talent is the most important thing in music. How old are you now? I'll be 23 this year. You've still got a long life ahead of you. Age is a misleading puzzle. Some who want longevity are given death. Some who are old and decaying are still granted life. Shuffle. Please don't be offended, Bhisma. Mbak Wid sees life as a never-ending puzzle. Do these cards answer the puzzle of your life? Take seven cards. Do you know that in the Mahabharata epic, only Bhisma, Bhisma, your namesake, only Bhisma was granted the right by the Gods to decide his own time of death? So, these cards decide your course of life? Babies die on me every day. Other people would've gone crazy. A baby dies today... a baby dies tomorrow... the day after tomorrow... Almost every day. Only these cards stop me from going crazy. They give me my sanity. You're on the threshold of heaven. No one in this modern age cares about disabled babies. I know their chance of survival is small. But as long as their hearts are still beating and they still breathe, someone has to look after them. You're two steps away from the gate of heaven. To think that I always wanted to become a ballerina. Any professional training? Actually, I performed a couple of times. Why did you quit? Something happened, and I had to give up my dreams. It's now my forgotten past. I have no regrets, especially now that I have Dewa. Dewa... the other babies... they're also God's creation. As beautiful as anything God has created. At first, I questioned God's doing. Why would he create such helpless and hopeless babies? They're beautiful, yet lifeless. Like a violin... like a violin with no strings. Like a stringless violin. Impossible to play. Impossible to create beautiful melodies. Do you believe that miracles exist in this world? Miracles? Of course I believe in miracles. But I don't know whether God has a miracle planned for those babies. It happened to me twice. Once, when Dewa was first admitted, they said he would only live for four months. The second one was when I danced for him. He responded by lifting his head. That's why I took him to your recital. I thought that... He responded? You were dancing? What's wrong? Let's just go home. I've got an idea. Renjani. No, Bhisma. Don't. Let go. Bhisma! Let go. I want you to leave now. Go home now. Get out! I love you, Dewa. I love you, Dewa. I love you very much, Dewa. It's impossible, Mbak Wid. I'm eight years older than him. I've arrived at my future, here, at this house, with Dewa and the other babies. My life is already settled. But... now, I'm frightened. Fear is a dilemmatic puzzle. Grey skies and we fear rain. Bright skies and we fear the sun. Since when has an age difference been an issue? And you're much too young to feel settled. I only want to be friends. Anything beyond that, I consider inappropriate. Inappropriate? Sangkuni's cheating in the game of dice caused Yudistira to lose his honor. Was that appropriate? Listen, Renjani. His years may be younger, but his soul is much older. His soul has wandered far through the depths of many lives. What does your heart tell you? I'm... I... What I like most about him is that since the day he met Dewa, he has always treated him like any other child. From the very beginning, he talked to Dewa... in the same manner that I do. What does your heart tell you? Renjani, he is a good man. Don't let the past stand in the way of your future. I'm scared. Men are the strangest puzzle. Women are the most illogical puzzle. You might never find a man like him again... who can accept Dewa for who he is. "THE STRINGLESS VIOLIN" FOR RENJANI AND DEWA Who is it? I'm writing this song for you... and Dewa. Both of you are my inspiration. But I can't seem to finish the song. I don't know how else to write it. I have never needed anything to play my music. I have never needed anyone. But now the melodies are all dead. My heart is also dead. I need you to be able to finish this song. I need you. I beg of you, don't cast me aside. Dewa has filled my soul. You have filled my heart. Renjani, I beg you, please don't cast me aside. I'm still confused. I haven't made peace with my past. Give me time. But you have to promise me that you will finish this song and play it for Dewa and me. I want to play it for you over the phone. I want your opinion. Where's Dewa? He's here, close by my side. Can you let him listen too? Take turns with him. Okay, we're both ready to hear it. Did you hear it clearly? No, it wasn't that clear. That's all right. Why don't we do it this way? I have been asked to perform this composition on Sunday evening. I want you to come to the usual place. Bring Dewa along. I have to... Renjani, don't cast me aside. But Bhisma... Renjani, don't cast me aside! Sunday night, and don't forget to bring Dewa. But you have to promise me that you will finish this song and play it for Dewa and me. Impossible to play. Impossible to create beautiful melodies. Destiny. Destiny is indeed the most confusing puzzle. Who would've guessed that destiny would dictate... that in the Bharatayuda wars, Arjuna... Where is Renjani? ...would meet his brother Karna in a duel... and that Kunti would have to accept losing one of her sons? Answer me. Where is Renjani? Renjani... is now with the five Pandawas... in heaven. She is resting in peace with her babies, and also with Gandari's one hundred babies. That night, she crumbled, just like Duryudana crumbled at the fatal blow of Bima's bludgeon. She was taken to the hospital, was in a coma for a week, and then passed away. The pain in her stomach... She had always believed it to be ulcers. It turned out to be cancer. Cervical cancer. Her womb, like Gandari's womb, could have been given birth to 100 children. Blood. Bima swore he would drink Dursasana's blood. Drupadi swore she would never tie her hair up unless it had been washed with the blood of Dursasana. They said the cancer had spread all over her body. The cancer was the result of her previous abortion. A careless abortion. Dewa... Where is Dewa? Tell me, Mbak Wid. Where is Dewa? Dewa! Mother, this is from Dewa. This one's from me, Renjani. I'm going to play a song for Mother. Renjani, this song is for you. I lo... love Mother. THE HEART IS AN INFINITE MEADOW OF HOPE WHERE MIRACLES DO COME TRUE...
