The world's gonna die. I can feel it coming. We knew this would happen, that sooner or later, man's reckless behavior would catch up with us. Eight years since the last drop of rain and no one knows what to do except raise the price of water. The wells dried up. We can't grow our own food anymore. It's gotten harder for us to stay in hiding. And I think about Ruth. I always think about Ruth. How did she survive out there on her own as broken as she is? I wish she'd never left. I wish I could have helped her, fixed her. But I can't let myself think that. I know better than anyone. If something's broken... it stays broken. - Anyone else? - Just me. Nights? One. Thirty-five for the room. Water? Half is 26, full is 50. Half. What... What's the name of this town? View Park. All right, that'll be... Sorry, I... Just a second. Hi, sorry, what was I... Right. That'll be... ...72, with tax. - I wanna play. - I understand. What did I tell you? - Angela will... wait. - Wait. It's... okay. Thank you. Thanks. Hello. Take your daughter and get under the desk. - What are you talking about? - Stay away from the windows. And cover her head. Hello? Are you there? What's going on? Are you okay? We're okay. It's okay. She said this room called the office? Yeah. - Just one woman? - That's what the owner said. Check the back. This is the emergency broadcast system. Please stand by for further information about water conservation. Expecting someone? Wow, this stuff is terrible, huh? I don't even remember what a, uh, proper cup of coffee tastes like. If... Uh, miss, can I... - What? Oh, no. - Oh, come on. Uh, I couldn't. I'm on a business trip. Not like I'm paying for it. Here you go, honey. Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, all right. I shouldn't have complained about it. Uh... No, you're right, it's terrible but... - so good. - Mm-hmm. Where you headed? Oh, uh, I'm just going. What does, uh... what does that mean? - Figuring some things out. - Hmm. I remember those days. I'm married. Nine years, two kids. So, my things are pretty much figured. Oh, speaking of which, I should... I should probably get going here. Well... it was nice talking to you. Take care, and, uh... and good luck. - Thanks. - Oh, I'm... I'm Bill. Thanks, Bill. All right. Thank you. Honey? I'm over here. What did you do? If you don't mind me asking. Really, you can just... - pull over here and I'll... - Look, um... my life is pretty... boring. Let me help you, all right? Let me make my wife proud. There should be a town... about 20 miles from here. If you drop me there, you can tell your wife you saved someone's life today. - That's it? - That's it. Okay. It's just crazy, right, I mean... here we are in the middle of nowhere and a cop shows up and heads right for your car just as you're walking out. Yeah. The world is a strange place these days, isn't it? But... I guess... everyone always thinks they're living the end of the world. I remember my, um, my grandmother... telling me about, uh, getting under her desk when they thought the bomb was gonna drop. And... we're still here. Did you know there was an earthquake in View Park last night? Since when are there... earthquakes in this part of the country? Heard about it on the radio. Headed this way. Stopped at, uh... the motel there and talked to a little girl. Heard all about this woman who told her and her mother to seek cover right before the earthquake started. You really thought that cop just showed up out of nowhere? Who do you think called them? Ruth? Ruth... please. Don't be scared. I'm a scientist. I work for the government. And we've been looking for you for a very long time. When... when Joe called and he said he finally found you... I didn't quite believe him, but, uh... he said he saw it with his own eyes and... I needed to see it, too. But, by the time I got there, you were gone. And Joe was, uh... You're hurting people, Ruth. Is that really what you want? We can help you. There are tests we can run. Procedures. So... why don't you... just... Fuck! Fuck! Twelve. - Can I get the key to the... - It's open. - Where am I? - A gas station. - What town? - Garrison. About three miles west and you'll hit it. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm, uh... Have you seen a woman? Hey! Hey! You serve food? Yeah. What do you want? I don't have any money. I can do the dishes and clean up whatever you need in the back. It's just you here? Here. A sandwich, some water. Washed clothes. Thanks. He's gone. Not gone... grown up. Where do people stay? Valley's look shut down. Are you from here? Owners couldn't afford the upkeep. You can still stay there, though. Can't beat the price. Just... ...make sure you find a room that still has a door. Lila, come back in here and help me. Be right there. You fixed the record player? Come on, I'll show you. You can finish cleaning up first. How'd you do it? Some of the screws were stripped, but I found a bigger screwdriver, so I was able to get them loose. Inside, two of the wires were burnt so I had to replace them. But it was much easier than a toaster. It wasn't easier... you just got better. Do you think... Do you think I could try the truck next? We can discuss it. Can I take a bath tonight, Bo? You took one last night. Did you finish your reading? Yes. Can I at least have enough to go to the bathroom? - My teeth, too. - Lila... - That's enough for both. - You are very proud. Very. Up. Son of a bitch. - You shouldn't smoke. - Shit! Hi, Ruth. Hi, Mom. - Look, I know you're angry. - Angry? You told me to pretend you were dead. There's nowhere else for me to go. What is that supposed to mean? I'm sober. Eleven months. I knew... getting sober meant the seizures might come back. I didn't think it could ever get worse. The other night, I even had two. Who knows about you? - What? - You had two in one night, Ruth. Someone must know. - I don't know. - You don't know? If I leave, I won't survive. You're not putting her in danger again, Ruth. How is she? Healthy and smart and nothing like you. So what is it that you want from me? I want us to try again. Your old clothes. Thank you. Do you need some ties? I'm all right. That was always the hardest part. Tying you up. - Do you need some salve? - No. Thank you. Are you sure? It looks worse than usual, I can get you so... Does she... have... Not like yours. More like mine. You know, parlor tricks. The Weavers are still the closest house, yeah? They left a few years back. As far as I know, there's no one around for miles. So she'll feel it? - A little. - A little? What does a little mean? It doesn't matter what I say, you're just... I'm sorry if my concern offends you... Are you gonna help me or are we just gonna keep doing the same thing to each other all over again? - Bo! - Lila! Bo! Wait here. Bo? Lila. This is your mother. Ruth. Let's go. Breakfast! Can I... That's my bowl. I... broke that bowl. I remember I wanted to use my abilities to fix it but... - our abilities can't fix things. - We can only take things apart. And put them back together the way they were. - If something's broken - If something's broken - it stays broken. - it stays broken. Eat up now. All we needed was a little glue. So you can like we can? I can't. I should. I did a long time ago. What happened? - What? - You've never told her? Tell me what? Your mother was different. How? When she used her abilities... strange things would happen. And no matter how hard I tried... I couldn't figure out why. I didn't know what to do with her. I just didn't know how to nurture it. And that's when the seizures started. And... when they did... I couldn't use my abilities anymore. So what did you do? I left. You just left? I did some things I shouldn't have done. Spent time with people I shouldn't have been with. What do you mean? I was... sick... for a long time. Did you make her some medicine? I did, honey but it didn't work. What did you have? It's not that kind of sick. Um, I can't really explain it, but, um... when I was... sick... the seizures went away. And did your abilities come back? They never did. I knew the back of your mother's head better than I knew her face. - If you left, then how did I... - I came back. With you. I was so messed up by that point... I couldn't stay. So why is it okay now? Your mother needs our help. I think if Bo can help me with my abilities... the seizures might go away. Why don't you show your mother what you can do? Huh? Go on. Show her. You can see them? She can. And she still finds it interesting. You don't? I've been seeing the colors for 52 years. What do they look like? You don't know? I've never seen them. Why not? I don't know. I just... can't. Hasn't Bo told you what they look like? I think she wants to hear it from you. Um... After you put back together whatever it is you took apart, everyone sees this object, but you see the colors. It's like an after-effect. An echo. Suddenly, there are all these colors. Moving... over everything. Fast, like a race. How does it feel? Really warm. It's like when you're about to cry but you're happy. Bo says... if you do something really big... the colors can last a long time. But just when you forget where you are... they're gone. Everything's just... normal again. Sheila. Has the analysis of the evidence not come back yet? - You didn't hear? - No. Didn't hear what? These other men, they said they were taking it over. W... What other men? W... What the hell are you talking about? You should call the lab. Yeah, that's precisely why we take care of our own business. Well, times have changed and we're not able to do anything about that. I mean, I... I understand that, but there needs to be some... some semblance of order, right? You can't just... Well, they took the samples. There's nothing you can do about it now, all right? Well, you do know that those samples were the only evidence we had. Don't forget to breathe. See the bucket in your mind. Inhale slowly. Just feel your connection to everything. Feel how everything is tied together. When you exhale... release the ties. - I'm so... - It's okay, just breathe. Breathe. That's enough for now. "Extraordinary discovery. My daughter, Martha, can also disintegrate objects and put them back together again. Do these abilities run in our family? I wish my mother were alive so I could ask if she could do this, too. If she could... I don't know why she never told me." Whose writing is that? My great-grandmother. All the women in our family write in this book. I don't know, I thought, maybe there would be... something in here to help guide us. "This land is so beautiful. Martha wants to plant flowers along the path. I already feel that we are safer. It was too dangerous after what happened with Martha at school. I couldn't bear the fear. Here, we can live our lives in peace and no one will know our secret." I knew this was Grandma's house, but I didn't realize... The women in our family have lived here for generations. Oh. Why didn't you ever tell me any of this? You weren't that big on history. I have an idea. - Yes? - What if, instead of the bucket, you just thought about when I took the bowl apart? Instead of having to imagine... you could just remember. - What the... - I don't... I'll go look. - What happened? - I don't know. There's nothing. Nothing hit it. Just a bunch of broken glass. Yours are different, right? Yeah. Did you do this? I don't know. I've been... so disconnected from them for such a long time, I... don't remember what it's like to actually do something. Are there others? - Other... - Women. - Like us. - I don't think so. But isn't that narciss... Narcissistic? Uh... yeah, it is. I mean, if we've always been hiding... how do we know? Did Bo ever tell you about Simona? - Who? - Don't get excited. Bo made her up. She lived in Europe, I think. And she could do things we couldn't do. Like, she could take apart the sky. I think Bo did it to help me. Like... if someone else had different abilities like me, maybe I would feel more okay? Bo even had me write a letter to her once. Like some freak girl's Santa Claus. But... eventually, she told me she wasn't real. Well... Bo said there's cardboard in the shed. And I should probably vacuum, too. What if... instead of cardboard, you... tried to put the glass back? It won't work. Why not at least try? Because, if something's broken, it stays... This isn't gonna work. But what if it did? Told you. You wouldn't happen to know anything about the car that was found abandoned on the road about ten miles or so from here? Heard about it on the radio. Am I in trouble? Why would you be in trouble? Well, there was a man and a woman that came in here. Did they have something to do with it? I don't know. Uh... w... what can you tell me about 'em? What happened right before? When the window broke? Yes. What were you thinking? I was... I don't know. Were you thinking about the bowl? No. Were you trying to remember it? No, I was... I really think if I could just get a few things, I can make it run. Can we go? Please, Bo. Please? Well... with Ruth being here... we could use a little extra water. - What can I get you, Officer? - Nothing, thanks. Uh, I just have a few questions. Please leav a message after the tone. Go. I'm gonna say hey to Miss Nancy. - How you doing? - I'm good. How is it going? You look good, you look good. - Got a shipment, huh? - Yeah, yeah. It still gets me, I swear to God. That's good. That's good. - Is that all you need? - Yeah. Okay. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change... the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Keep coming back. It works if you work it. And you're worth it. Ruth? Can you come help us? "Ruth wanted to go down to the pond today. I was afraid after what happened last time. But there's not much water left in it, so I figured there wouldn't be any people, either. There's been so little rain this summer. Ruth threw a fit that there wasn't enough for a swim. She tried to take apart the water. She told me she wanted to make more." Lila's never even been swimming. Oh. The... the phone rang... when you were out. Oh. The answering machine came on, they didn't leave a message. You have one new message. One, two, three... four, five. Hey, I found some of my old stuff. - Can I... - Yeah, come in. Do you wanna see these? Now, Lauryn Hill got pregnant when she was 22. Lots of people told her it would ruin her career. But it only made her better. She made this. And the best song on there is about her kid. Hey, that's one of Bo's records. No matter what kind of music you like, you like Nina. That's the rule. And last but not least... X-Ray Spex. The lead singer was Poly Styrene. And after seeing the Sex Pistols live, she decided to form her own group. She put an ad in the paper that just read, "Looking for young punks who wanna stick it together." Hey! You wrote that in the truck. What? You wrote that in the back of the truck. Oh. Shit. Yeah. That was yours, right? It was. Bo doesn't know this, but... I'm fixing it so I could leave. She thinks I just like fixing things. I mean, I do. But... I wanna see what's out there. Didn't you ever wonder if our abilities meant something? Like, we could really... do something. We're not superheroes, Lila. We're just trying to get by. - But what if there's more? - Trust me. There's not. But what if there is and you just can't see it? Don't be in such a hurry to leave, okay? Why not? You did. Exactly. Okay. Bed time. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hi, Bonny. What made you use our old signal? Ruth. She's here, you know. Oh, I knew it. Oh, I knew it. She's at the house. I... I... Is she okay? She's working on it. We're... working on it. Um... has she told you anything? What do you mean? About a car or, uh, there was a car on the side of the road, out by Jimo's, out on the old highway. Well, you know me, I... I can never let a thing go and I'm just trying - to figure out... - What the hell are you talking about, Dean? I already told you, he attacked me - and I defended myself! - I told you, you cannot be putting her in danger again. - You think I don't know that? - I don't believe - you actually do! - What's going on? Are you leaving? I'm not leaving, all right? I'm not leaving. We saw a girl in town. It looked just like her. I think, uh... I think it's her family. I think that's why she's here. - Now, my men... - They're not happy. I just need a little more time. You left a car with blood and bullet holes by the side of the road. Well, I couldn't just drive a crime scene into town. So you just left it there for them to find? I'm a scientist, okay? I sit in a room all day. I'm collecting data. Getting her was supposed to be Joe's job, not mine. Yeah, well, see, Bill, that's precisely the point. You had her and you lost her. They're running out of patience. We have never been this close before. You have to make them \understand. You... you saw our research, right? This woman can cause tectonic plates to shift. Plates that have never moved before. Do you realize what that means? She can affect the energy of the Earth. And they're running out of patience because I needed backup? The first time I left this house... I met your father. My mother wouldn't even... take me to town with her when she went. So... one day, I snuck out. Got as far as the edge of Garrison... and stopped at the candy store. I could not believe that there was a room somewhere in the world that was full of candy. I just stood there staring in the window. He was across the street with his father, you know, where the old hardware store used to be. Came over. Bought me a piece of... blueberry taffy. And he walked with me just for a little. We did that almost every Saturday for a year... until my mother found out. When she did... even this front yard was off limits. But enough time went by and she lowered her guard. I saw him again. We came up with a secret signal. We'd meet at the high school track... in the middle of the night. By the time mother caught on again... I was pregnant with you. I don't wanna mess it up this time. I... We're all just doing the same thing over and over again hoping that someone will get it right. Oh, my... You did it! Oh, my God. I can't... Let me see that. Well... I told you if you did it, you can have it. I am so proud of you. - Come here. - Technically, it's my truck. So I'm the only one who can give it to you. And... I guess you can have it. What're those? Tools. Yes, I'm aware of that. But where'd they come from? I found them. Where? In the shed. Those tools are new, Lila. You've never lied to me. How'd you get them out of the store? Lila? Did you have something to do with this? - What? No. - She didn't do anything. This is not what our abilities are for. Then what are they for? What's the fucking point? Go inside now. Both of you. Now. What's going on? What are you doing here, Dean? Don't worry, Bonnie, I'm not here to take her in. If you're not here to take her in, then why are you here? There's a lot more to it than I told you last night. They know, Bonnie. They know. They've been following her for months. It's something about doing tests on you. They've tracked you to town. You need to go. There's not much time. If I'd have told you, would you have let me stay? Hey. Why are you helping us? She doesn't know? Lila... this is my dad. Your grandfather. Hey, you, uh... you know about your mom's seizures, right? Well, wh... when they started it was dangerous for all of us to live in town. So your Bo decided it was best that she and your mom move out here. Back to the house that Bo grew up in. That's why we haven't been together. Go. - Take me with you. - Lila. - Please! - Lila. Please. Please. You know how I told you I was sick? I'm a drug addict, Lila. I was so messed up, I don't even know who your father is. I got sober when you were born and... for a while the seizures didn't happen and I thought maybe... you'd fixed me. But then... one morning... it came back. So you left me. Now you're just gonna leave me again? Our abilities mean shit, Lila! All right? There is nothing out there! It's just a horrible place full of horrible people! Come here, sweetheart. Come here. Just go! All of you! Shit, shit, shit. Mom! Lila? Lila! Mom! - Where are they? - Ruth, what are you doing here? - You should be gone. - Where are they? - Your mother's on her way here. - And Lila? Those men came to the house looking for you. Where's Lila? - They took her to the station. - What? When they came to the house, she used her abilities. Why? She thought she could make them stop looking for you. You can't go, Ruth. They've taken it over. Your mother's there now. She will be here soon, and we just have to wait. You know, in case you're wondering, um... you know, after you left, I sold the body shop... and I became a sheriff. I figured it was the best way to... ...take care of you all and... maybe even find you. Whenever there was a case of a woman gone missing, it's... it's always you. I've been doing it for so long I can't remember when it started. How did you know it was me this time? A bartender, out at the place near Valley's. She said you were sober. Is that right? - Dean, you gotta get... - Mom. - Ruth, what are you doing here? - Where's Lila? They won't let me see her. - You've gotta go. - I can't. - Ruth? - I saw the colors. - What? - I did. I saw them. Right after I left. You were right that someone could take apart the sky. But it's not Simona. I'm gonna get Lila. - No. - It's okay. Mom, - No. - it's okay. It's okay. I'm in control. I started to have a seizure but I stopped it. I'm in control now. For so long, I was haunted by the pipes breaking and the walls and the water but... I couldn't remember her face. I'm not scared anymore. Bonnie, we gotta go after her. I know you think we might not be able to stop those men, - but we gotta try. - You don't understand. All these years of hiding... wasn't just because of Ruth. I'm not afraid that I can't stop these men. I'm afraid I can. Holy shit! What have we got? What's going on? - It's her. - Hands in the air! - Okay, give me a minute here. - Put your hands up. - Give me a minute. - Don't move. - Can we just... - Let us handle this, sir. She doesn't have a weapon. Please, ma'am, I don't want these men to... What're you doing, Bill? What're we waiting for? It will be better for you if you cooperate. - Hey! - Don't move. Don't move. - The hell's going on? - I don't know, man. It will be better for you if you cooperate. They're children. You don't want them. Take me instead. Bonnie, that's not what we planned. No, I know, but they'll just keep coming after us. They'll always come after us, I'm... I'm done hiding. You're going to let them go. I'm going to stay here with you. And if you listen, I'll tell you everything. I have a gift. It was passed down to me by my mother, and her mother before her. We've stayed hidden because anytime we came into the light, someone tried to take us, to hurt us. But that time is over now. You're scared because the world is dying and you don't know how to stop it. But I do. A new world is coming. This is only the beginning. Come. - Give this to your mother. - She came back? For you. Hey? You're not coming. No, sweetheart... but don't worry. They can't hurt me now. - I love you, Bo. - I love you, too. Go. Come on. I know. I understand. I understand you. Bo told me to... What? What is it?
