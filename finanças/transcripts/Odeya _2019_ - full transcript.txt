When enemies were invading the fort Her husband was having his lunch Not to disturb her husband She took the mast and fought with enemies This land is the birthplace of Onake Obavva Lets stand to protect this family We should be awake when they go to sleep I wondered why God brought us to such an affectionate family Now I know why We should raise our weapons for the sake of the same family we disowned violence We still got four days for this fair to end We don't know who'll attack from which direction Keep your eyes open Gajendra, what are you doing over there? come here please Is everybody here?

That is the power of my brother Even a tiger will shed tears and surrender to him What do you mean? My brother is like that Punyakoti cow from PunyaKoti story That one is the tiger I made a mistake without realizing How do I rectify it? Forgive me, Odeyar I did a mistake by not knowing who is the real lord Power to challenge and guts to accept it Not everyone has it Only few can Here's your money and documents I'll walk him to the car You exiled me from my town and I came here Now that you've followed me here Tell me where you won't go I will go there only I will be in all over Karnataka Do you have any plans of stepping out of Karnataka?

When I have Gajendra next to me saved me by staking his life You saved not just his life but the serenity of this town Brother, come with me Tomorrow is the last day of the festival Narasimha will be hanged The grave danger to this family will cease to exist You have brought son instead of son-in-law The day after thefestival I shall preside their wedding I've fixed the muhurat Next day 8 am after the festival Mr Gajendra and one and only daughter of Srinivas Odeyar Ms Shakambari Devi I've fixed the muhurat Is it okay son-in-law? Why this sudden change of heart? I remembered what I got from you Glad you did Yes indeed Uncle, tell me what did he recall? What did you recall? What did you recall? What did you recall? Beat the drums Start the rhythm Here comes the man of mass Make way here comes the man of class He is going to shine like a lightening flash Glory to him O you charmer from Malavalli attend the fair A cute girl is here to see the procession Here comes the man of mass Make way here comes the man of class When my girl is draped in a silk saree Gives a sign asking how is it? Tell me how can this poor soul stand it? O you charmer from Malavalli attend the fair A cute girl is here to see the procession Here comes the man of mass Make way here comes the man of class He is going to shine like a lightening flash Glory to him Look at the procession not me You are looking more beautiful than the procession Stop flirting with me in the crowd! You will kill me with your looks Wish everyone vanish from here Wish we two only see the fair Lets enjoy a matinee show in a tent O you charmer from Malavalli attend the fair A cute girl is here to see the procession We found a cute son-in-law for our town Our village fair turned vibrant because of your visit Lets welcome him with grandeur You are the lord of our town hereafter I am thankful for your affection I am not an outsider anymore I am one of you now I will never forget your love till my last breath O you charmer from Malavalli attend the fair A cute girl is here to see the procession Siddanna Where did you find it? We found it in uncle's jeep These sickles have blood stains, Odeya There are plenty more here Tell me how they landed in his jeep Explain to him how they landed in your jeep You didn't change at last Is there any link between the sickles in your jeep, blood stains on them and you? Yes there is When my daughter told me she is in love I didn't inquire anything and asked her to bring him home Because ethics and culture are greater than caste and creed But you deceived us Do you know how hard I tried to stop violence? But you brought it to my home I lost my son I don't have the strength to bear the death of my daughter I beg you Kindly leave Not festival but their funeral procession should happen here Don't care if it is kids, elders or women Slaughter whoever comes in your way Welldone! You saved them! Don't think you won in the challenge You forgot your family in a hurry to save that family Brother! Your brother is bleeding to death Show yourself to me Surrender that family to me and take your brother from here Guard them safely Brother, we will join you Where is Odeyar family? Where are you hiding them? Narasimha! You want our lives only Why are you hitting Vinayagam? What is the connection? What is the connection? He rescued your family from my bloodthirsty henchmen He patrolled your house day and night He said Odeyar family is his family He challenged me saying he won't let me touch Odeya family Even now he kept you well hidden and tried to save you I asked him where you were threatening to kill his brother He didn't reply 'I will kill you' I yelled He didn't reply to this either Don't die so fast I'll kill each person in front of your eyes Then you have my permission to die Open your eyes You are raising again like Tsunami even after getting beaten up so badly What did this family do for you? One who feeds is the mother One who teaches is the father This family gave both to me I said this then I repeat it now This is my family If you have guts step over me Try to touch them People forget gratitude very easily these days Why did you face so many hassles for my family? You didn't whisper a word! We pray to god in trouble I believe I must lend my hand to people in trouble One must share only happiness with everyone around When it comes to hardship one who faces it alone Those who long for praising are not lords The one who cares for others is the true lord You are the living example for that My world is my daughter Hereafter you the Odeya of our family Mr Gajendra Odeyar Shall we all go on honeymoon together?
