Shut up! Oh, hey, you're up- I wasn't sure if you, you know, wanted to sleep in or not. Am I in a dorm room? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone Where are my clothes? On the dresser. I folded your pants last night. You know, I wasn't sure if that material gets wrinkled. Great. Uh... Don't know if you remember my name or not. Pretty wasted last night. Tylenol? What? My head is killing me. Do you have any Tylenol? Yes. Yes, I do. Sorry. Thanks. I'm Carter, by the way. Not a word of this to anyone, got it? Yeah. Sure. Dude! Did you hit that fine vagina or what? Nice one, dickhead. Hey! Stop global warming? Oh. Run! 63 bottles of beer on the wall 26 hours, that's all you got? Bottles of beer on the wall. I can't hear you! 62 bottles of beer. You take one down Pass it around. Keep going! Hey! Hi. You haven't returned any of my texts. Yeah, sorry, I've been busy. Yeah, I can see that. Okay, Tim, we went on a date. One. I don't have to text you back. We're not, like, a thing. Okay. I just... You know, I figured we had a nice time. You had a nice time. I was miserable. I mean, who takes their first date to Subway? It's not like you have a footlong. Hey, does this look infected to you? Someone drank my kombucha! Is this gluten-free? Yes. Of course. Oh, my God! You sneaky little beeyotch! Who was it? Nobody. Sisters don't keep secrets. Seriously, it was nobody. Well, I hope "nobody" used a condom. We don't want somebody looking like a whore. Thanks, Danielle. Super helpful. What are sisters for? Oh, and don't forget, house meeting at lunch. Living for it. Hmm. She finally rolls in. Did I totally embarrass myself last night? Not at all! Unless you consider dancing on a table, starting two fights and barfing pretzel chunks all over the bar embarrassing. Please tell me you're kidding. Oh, and you also rammed your tongue down Nick Sims' throat right in front of Danielle. Oh, God! But she was so nice to me this morning. Yeah, I think she was as drunk as you last night. So consider it collective amnesia. Thank God for that! Oh, crap! I'm so late for class. I can't find my damn book! Ha! Did you really think you could keep it a secret from me? How did you find out? Driver's license. Not the best picture, I might add. I assume you changed my ringer, too? Who, me? Never. What'd you wish for? A new roommate. Wench. I made that from scratch! Sorry, too many carbs. Toodles! Locomotive response in the subject shows an acceleration across the quantum plane. This creates great orbital overlap between the partially positive base of carbon and the partially negative hydrogen alkali group. Thanks. Get your school spirit on before the big game. 10% off with your student ID. We really need to step up our game at the Sigma parties, okay? And we still need to pick this year's charity. I can say right now, there's no way we're doing the Special Needs Art Fair again. Totally freaked my shit out. Thoughts? What's wrong? Oh, I don't know. What's wrong, Tree? Nothing. Except for that cat lady buffet you just dumped at our table. And is that chocolate milk I see? I missed breakfast. What is breakfast, Becky? Oh! Asshole! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Tree. Wait, you two know each other? Yeah. No! We had a class together last year. Look, I was bringing you this back. Sorry, I didn't know where you lived. You know, I... Yeah. I'm sorry again about the mess. What a douchebag! Dr. Lawrence to outpatient services. Dr. Lawrence to outpatient services. Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone Lori! Hi. Hi. Um... So, I thought you only work nights. Doing a double for Jen. She has the flu. That's nice of you. So, I guess I don't need to ask what you're doing here? Got to go! Look, Tree. It's none of my business, but I think something like this is bound to have some pretty serious consequences. You're right. It is none of your business. Dr. Surd and Dr. Margolan, 2476. Dr. Surd and Dr. Margolan, 2476. We can't do this today. There's too much going on in the building. I have patients. And I'm losing mine. Gregory. Hi. Hey, sweetie. What's with the door? Stupid thing got jammed. Oh. Just wrapping up here. Have you met my student, Theresa? No, I haven't. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Thank you so much for helping me out. This is a nice surprise. Nathan's been acting really strange since our big fight. And this morning, he drove to Atlanta for a last-minute business meeting about opening a new gym. Enter. Which is weird because I've never heard anything about it before. But I'm trying not to let that bring me down. Is that my top? How cute is it on me? Whatever. Just don't get anything on it, please. You mean like Nick's nutter butter? Wow. Classy, Danielle. What time are you going to the party tonight? I don't know. Later. Ugh. Our tuition dollars at work. Anyhow, don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken. Okay. Bye. Bye! Who took my hair dryer? Crazy bitch! Theresa, it's Dad. I sat in that restaurant waiting for you for over an hour. I can't believe you would do this to me, today of all days! Bayfield, baby! Ooh! Babies for life! Okay, you guys are hilarious. You can come out now. Losers. Yo, I think your friends went the other way. Can I help you? Look, weirdo, I'm not scared. Why don't you go try this with one of the heifers at Delta Gamma? They're into cosplay. Okay, I'm calling the cops. Shut up! Oh, hey, you're up- I wasn't sure if you, you know, wanted to sleep in or not. And now you gotta pick up the phone. Oh... Right, yeah. I folded your pants for you last night. You know, I wasn't sure if that material gets wrinkled. Uh... I don't know if you remember my name or not, you know, you were pretty wasted last night. But, uh... I'm... Carter. You remember. Tylenol? What? My head is killing me. Do you have any Tylenol? Oh, uh... Yes. Um... It's over there. Right. It's under your clothes on the thing. Right. Right. Thanks. And... It's like you've been here before. Are you okay? Tree. Are you okay? Dude! Did you hit that fine vagina or what? I'm... I'm sorry. Nice one, dickhead. Hey! Stop global warming? Sorry, no thanks. Oh. Run! 64 bottles of beer on the wall 64 bottles of beer. I'm soaked! You take one down. Pass it around 63 bottles of beer on the wall 26 hours, that's all you got? Keep going! Faster! 62 bottles of beer on the wall 62 bottles of beer. Keep going! I can't hear you! Hey! You haven't returned any of my texts. Tim, what day is it? Uh, Monday the 18th. You're sure? I'm pretty sure. I, um... I gotta go. Call me! Oh, my God! You sneaky little beeyotch! Who was it? Sisters don't keep secrets. I'm totally having d√©ja vu right now. Oh! I have it all the time. It's supposed to mean someone's thinking about you while they're masturbating. I have it at least five times a day. Seriously, I've been having it all clay. It's so weird. Maybe you should switch to water next time, hon. I... Yeah, thanks. I'll keep that in mind. What are sisters for? Oh, and don't forget, house meeting at lunch. Hello? It's been on the board since last Thursday, Tree. Yeah. I remember it. Um... She finally rolls in. That's so weird. You okay? You were kind of a mess last night. Oh, shit. I'm so late for class. Did you really think you could keep it a secret from me? Don't you wanna know how I found out? Driver's license? Clever girl. That picture, though. I gotta go. But you didn't even blow out the... Candle. We really need to step up our game at these frat parties, okay? And we still need to pick this year's charity. I can say right now, there's no way we are doing the Special Needs Art Fair again. Get your school spirit on before the big game. 10% off with your student ID. What's wrong, Tree? Um, I'm just a little tired, I guess. No, dumb-ass. What's wrong with that? So not Kappa cuisine. And is that chocolate milk I see? I missed breakfast. We all miss breakfast, Becky. Becky, look out! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Tree. Wait, you two know each other? Yeah. I mean... No! We had a class together last year. That's all. I'm sorry about all this. Hey. What? My bracelet. Oh. You know, I'm sorry again about the mess. What a douchebag! We can't do this today. There's too much going on in the building. I need to talk to you. Tree, I... I know what you're gonna say. You do? Look. It's normal for a young girl to have feelings for an older man, but you can't fall in love. I'm not falling in love with you. You're not? No. I've been having the weirdest day... Your wife. Uh, that's kind of a buzzkill. Gregory. Are you in there? Thank God you locked the door. Hey, sweetie. Uh, I didn't realize I'd locked the door. Um... Just wrapping up here. Have you met my student, Theresa? No... I haven't. Nice to meet you. Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday to us. My favorite girls. Blow it out. There you go. That! What's that? You guys, I think I just found a bug. Where? Right in there. Take a look. And Mom goes in for the kill. Oh, no. Oh, no. Hey, don't look at me. Oh, I guess I'm not having leftovers. ...for a last-minute business meeting about opening a new gym. I know! I'm just borrowing it for tonight. What time you going to the party? But I'm trying not to let that bring me down. Hello? Earth to space bitch. What? What time are you going to the party? Uh... I don't know. Later. Ugh. Our tuition dollars at work. Okay, whoa! Chill out. It's just another rolling blackout, sweetie. It happened before? Yeah. Like two weeks ago. Anyhow, don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken. Who took my hair dryer? Theresa, it's Dad. I sat in that restaurant waiting for you for over an... Bayfield, baby! Babies for life! Yo, Mike. Come on. Hurry up, man. Hold up. I'm coming. Here we come. No way. Surprise? What the hell, Tree? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I thought that you... I am so, so sorry. Don't mess with a Kappa bitch. Yes. Are you serious? Yes. That slut. Who? Lori. She said she'd be here. She's so out of the house next year. I think she said she had, like, a double shift. Whatevs. She's been boning some mystery guy. There's your stalker. He's so hot. Danielle! What? That's so gross. Oh, okay. Truce? Hi. Why were you wearing that stupid mask anyway? Big game's on Friday. I just thought I'd show a little school spirit. Never thought I'd get clocked for it. I really am sorry. Did you ice it? It's fine. You can make it up to me later. What? Don't "what" me. You know exactly what you are doing, Tree. What am I doing, Danielle? Danielle! Nick? Wow. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, Nick. You scared me. You want me to punch you in the face again? Welcome to the pleasure-dome. It's a little loud, don't you think? Okay! I'm officially over this. Have fun in the Sahara Tent. Come on. Nick, seriously! Danielle's, like, freaking out. No! Help me! Help me! You asshole! Is everything okay? Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. What... I don't know if you remember my name or not. You were... Pretty wasted. Yeah. And your name is Carter? Yeah. And we've never met before? I mean, no, not until last night. Oh, my God. This is a nightmare. I'm sorry. You were the one that wanted to come home with me. Dude! Did you hit that fine vagina... Nice one, dickhead. Stop global warming? Oh! A simple "no thanks" would do. Oh. 26 hours, that's all you got? Keep going! 62 bottles of beer. You take one down. I can't hear you! Hey! You okay? You haven't returned any of my texts. She finally rolls in. Hey, you okay? Tree? Tree, what's wrong? Say something. Lori... I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what's happening to me. Okay. Just calm down. Tell me what's going on. Look, I know this isn't gonna make any sense, but I have already lived through this day. Twice. Tree. No, no, no. Believe me. I know it sounds totally crazy, but this is happening to me, I swear to God. Tree. I'm sure it feels like you're living through... Okay, you made me a cupcake. For my birthday, right? You're about to give it to me and then later on tonight there's a surprise party. Ugh. Who told you? Was it Becky? No, no. Nobody told me. That's what I mean. Don't you see? I know what is going to happen before it happens. Lori... Lori, somebody is gonna kill me tonight. Oh. Okay. Okay, I get it. Who put you up to this? Was it Danielle? No, no, no. This isn't some stupid joke! This is actually happening to me. I don't know who is going to kill me, but someone is. I just don't know who it is yet. Tree, you're starting to freak me out. How do you think I feel? Tree, look at me. Nobody is trying to kill you. Yes, they are, Lori. Tree, look at me! I know that today is hard with your mom and all. Why don't you skip class? Just take the day off and get some rest. I promise you, you'll feel better tomorrow. Okay? Let's see you get in here now, asshole. Tree, why is the door locked? Um... I just need some alone time. What time are you going to the party tonight? I don't know. Ugh. Our tuition dollars at work. Anyhoo, don't be too late, or all the cute Sigma boys will be taken. Okay. See you soon. Who took my hair dryer? ...opening a new gym. Which is weird because I've never heard anything about it before. But I'm trying not to let that bring me down. Because I'm on my way to pick up Jace. I'm just happy you're gonna see Jace. I know. 'Cause it's been, like, almost a month. He's gonna be so excited to see you. Where'd Lori put the freaking remote? Hi, Jace! Hey, Jace. Hey. Hi. Hi. I'm Barbara. I am Crystal. Hi. Nice to meet you. Can you say bye to Mamey? Bye. Stay buckled and have a good time. G-48. It's that great. G-48. G-48! I don't know what's going on with you and that other guy, okay? ...is being treated for a gunshot wound following a deadly shoot-out this morning that left one officer dead. Tombs was the subject of... ...boring hairstyles? Do you go through a can of hair spray trying to get that full, volumized look? Then bump it up with Bumpits and get that salon-style look. Flat to fabulous, instantly. Imagine being able to create today's... No! What's wrong? What's going on? Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. Tree, are you okay? Are you sick? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Oh, my God. Make it stop. Make it stop. Are you okay? Get away from me. All right. Come on, just... Stop global warming? Oh. Bottles of beer... You take one down 61 bottles of beer on the wall. Louder! 61 bottles of beer on the wall. You take one down Pass it around. I can't hear you! I'm sorry. You forgot your stuff. Keep going! Help me. Will you please stop staring at me like I took a dump on your mom's head? I'm sorry. I'm just trying to wrap my brain around this. How's that going for you? Assuming that I believe any of this is even remotely possible, there has to be a reason you're stuck in this day. Okay? Out of all the days of your life, what makes this day special? What gives this day meaning? Nothing. Yeah, it's my birthday and now you gotta pick up the phone. It's your birthday? Yeah. Hello? So? Birthdays are just excuses to, like, eat cake and open presents and shit. There's no real meaning behind a birthday. No, it's symbolic. Okay? Whoever's killing you knows it's your birthday. All right, look. Give me a list of names of everybody who knows it's your birthday and whoever is trying to kill you. Well, thanks to my sorority, pretty much the entire school knows it's my birthday. God, they're throwing me this stupid surprise party tonight. I mean, it literally could be anyone. I mean, who has motive? Okay, maybe it's Danielle. All right. Apparently, I made out with some guy she liked right in front of her last night. Huh. Must have been before we met. Busy night? Okay, Mr. "I'm gonna take this drunk girl home and take advantage of her." Don't judge. For the record, I didn't take advantage of you last night, okay? I slept on Ryan's bed. So, we didn't have... No! You were wasted last night. You know, I was afraid you were gonna fall or choke on your own vomit like Janis Joplin. Uh, what were we... Suspects. Right. Suspects. Um, okay, so Danielle. Gregory. Um, his wife. Creepy Tim. Ooh! Um, that tiny girl from T.J. Maxx that I got fired. And maybe the Uber driver that I spit on last week. I think his name was... What? Nobody's perfect. Okay. This isn't helping. This is pointless, isn't it? All right, look. The way I see it is you have unlimited amount of lives. So you have unlimited opportunities to solve your own murder. So I'm just supposed to keep dying until I figure out who my killer is? That's your genius plan? Do you have a better idea? Tim! Oh! He's gay! It's so exhausting. Asshole! You bitch! I knew it was you! Come here! Get off of me! I'm gonna kill you. Oh, my God. Becky? Becky! Becky! Becky! Shut up! Ow! Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up... Oh, hey, you're up- I wasn't sure if you wanted to sleep in... Your plan totally sucks. What? I don't know if you remember my name or not. You know, you were pretty wasted last night. Um... But I'm Carter. Are you okay? Never better. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. Dude! Did you hit that fine vagina or... What's up? Hey. Um, I'm sorry to bother you guys, uh... How did it go? I had to sleep in my car, so he could finally get laid. Carter, please, a little help. Carter! Tree. Hey, hey, hey, calm down. It's just me. How you doing? What happened? You collapsed this morning. What day is it? It's Monday. What's the date? Uh, it's the 18th. Oh, we've been trying to get in contact with your parents, but for some reason there's... Jeez! Can I help you? Uh, I'm just checking on her. It's okay. He's a friend. Sorry. Visiting hours are over. Got it. Thanks, Carter. Feel better. When can I get out of here? I'm having a hard time pulling your medical records. Why? We just got these back from imaging. And these are signs of major trauma. Given the severity of the scar tissue and the size of the lesions... This is gonna sound crazy but, technically, you should be dead. Hey. Hey, hey! What are you doing? I need to get out of here. No way. No, you need to stay here for observation. If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna die. Tree, Tree. Listen to me. You are absolutely safe here. Okay. I won't let anything happen to you. I'm really thirsty. Could you get me a soda? Sure. Thank you. Special delivery. Keys, keys, keys. Oh, Greg. Where are the car keys? Come on! Tree. Tree. It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. Gregory, look out! Come on. Come on, come on, come on. I did it. I did it! I did it! Whoo! Yeah! Catch me now, bitch! Whoo! What? Oh, no, no, no! Come on! No! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit. I know I was speeding, officer. I just... Turn off the engine, please. Yes, officer. License and registration. I, um... I don't have it. Pardon me? He's trying to kill me again. Yes! Again? I mean, no. He was trying before, but this time I got away. But I didn't have time to grab my clothes, and my driver's license is in my pocket. Ma'am, are you under the influence of alcohol or any other controlled substance? No! That is what I'm trying to... Wait. If I am, does that mean that you're going to arrest me and lock me in a jail cell? That's how it usually works. I'm drunk. You are? Wasted. And I'm high. You know, pills, weed. You name it, man, I'm on it. Uh... Well... Then I'm gonna put you under arrest. That's a good idea. Let me help you. Uh, all right. Never been arrested before. Uh-huh. Thank you. All units, we got a 1-8-7 at University Hospital. Suspect is... Shit. Oh, God, get me out. Get me out, get me out! What do you want? Why are you doing this to me? Who are you? Show your face, you pussy! Where are you going? Oh, shit! Oh, fuck. Oh, hey, you're up- Silence! Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. What, you've been here before? Hey, you know, I don't think you should be taking that many. I mean, you could... You could die. If only it were that easy. Water, por favor. Come on. There you go. Dude! Did you hit that... Hi. I'm the so-called fine vagina. And if that's the way that you refer to girls, you and your hand are going to have a very lasting relationship. Have a nice day. What? Are you... You're always this charming in the morning? Mmm. Just this one. So were you having a bad dream or something? Sorry? You were just screaming before you woke up. Well, I was dying. Again. What? Um, it's a long story. Well, I've got time. I'm not doing anything today if you wanna... Seriously, I hate this sticker. Hey, wait. Why are you following me? I wanna hear your story. Look, no offense, but the last time I explained it to you, it got me nowhere. So... The last time? Hey. So you're having bad dreams. I took an elective course on neurocognition and dream content. Hooray for you. I'm just saying... I might be able to help, you know? Can you help me stop reliving the same day over and over only to be murdered by someone I may or may not know? Yep, thought so. Stop global warming? Mmm. Wait, you literally think you're reliving the same day? Yep. And somebody kills you. Yep, again. All right, come on. You're just messing with me, right? Sprinklers. Oh. Car alarm. Now, see that pledge over there? The one in the baseball hat? He's going to fall right now. Keep going! Any questions? - How are your fries? Mmm. - Yeah, they're good. That's impressive. Mmm. That was nothing. Did you get it all out? Whatever. You won't remember it anyway. Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. It's your birthday? It's your dad. You wanna... You wanna get that? I was never close with my dad. Can't even remember the last time he called me on my birthday. Kinda always forgets. Yeah. I'm supposed to be with mine. I don't know. I couldn't bear the thought of sitting through another uncomfortable celebration while we both pretend that everything is awesome. Are you closer with your mom? Was. What happened? Oh, she... Yeah. Three years ago. I'm sorry. That... That... That sucks. Yeah. We actually shared the same birthday, though. Seriously? That's crazy. Yeah, when I was a kid, I always got to skip school. We'd go to the beach. My dad would buy us this, like, huge birthday cake and put just one candle on it. We'd blow it out together. I bet you miss her. Yeah. You know, it's funny. You relive the same day over and over again, you kind of start to see who you really are. If my mom saw me now, knew who I've become... I don't think she'd be very proud. Don't say that. It's true. I'm not a good person, Carter. Maybe this is karma. Maybe I deserve it. Look, I don't know you all that well, but it's never too late to change. I mean, especially if what you're saying is true. Each new day, it's a chance to be somebody better. See, that's just it. I don't think I have that many chances left. I keep on getting weaker every time I come back. Maybe I'm like that cat with nine lives. Eventually, I'm gonna run out. Let's go live now to Bayfield University Hospital where Jennifer Tran has the latest on this developing situation. I'm standing outside the Bayfield University Hospital where suspected murderer, John Tombs, is being treated for a gunshot wound... Can you turn that up, please? ...that left one officer dead. Tombs was the subject of a nationwide manhunt that ended after a five-month pursuit across four state lines... What's going on? Tree? ...that left six female victims. Authorities are still not sure if Tombs is responsible for the murders... Oh, my God. ...of more than a dozen other victims he's claimed to have buried across the vast desert of Arizona. He's been here the whole time. What? Tree! Hey... Tree! He's going to escape. Call the police. Who? John Tombs. Just call the police. What? Wait! Don't go in there! Shit. Excuse me. What are you doing? He has a gun! He has a gun, run! Come on. Hey! Carter! Stop! Stop it right now. Hey! No. No. Carter! There's nowhere to hide, little girl! Carter. If I don't reset this day, he's gone forever. You should've killed me when you had the chance. Come on. Olly, Olly, oxen free. Hey! See you soon, asshole. Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. Oh-hey, you're up. I wasn't sure if you wanted... I can't believe you tried to save my life. Thank you so much. Yeah. Yeah, no biggie. I just brought you home. Uh, I don't know if you remember my name. Carter. Yeah. You... I... Oh! Do you mind if I borrow this? Uh... Yeah, yeah. Sure. See you at lunch. Dude! Did you hit that fine vagina or what? You naughty, naughty boy! Fine vagina out! What just happened? Hey! Stop global warming? Sure. You save that planet, girl. Yo! Sprinklers about to go on. You're welcome. 26 hours, that's all you got? I can't hear you! You take one down Pass it around 62 bottles of beer on the wall. Oh, Tim. I know you're back there. Hi, Tim. Hey. Hi. Uh, you haven't returned any of my texts. Look, Tim. Let's get real. I know you don't like girls. Stop trying to be someone you're not. Love is love, right? Now you go out there and get yourself a fine piece of man ass. Good morning. Oh, my God! You sneaky little beeyotch! His name's Carter. No, we did not have sex. But if I finally make it through this day somehow... I'm gonna have his babies. Lots to do, got to go. She finally rolls in. What's wrong? Ugh. Oh, nothing. I was... Look, Lori... I have been the worst roommate. You've always been there for me, but I've been way too selfish to even appreciate it. Can we start over? I promise not to be such a loser. Are you high? On life. Oh! By the way, I wanna hear about this mystery guy. When extreme agitation occurs locomotive response in the subject shows an acceleration across... Dr. Butler. Can I have a word, please? What the hell do... What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm ending this. Wait. What? I never should have started seeing you. It was wrong. And I... Anyway, I can't change what I've done, but I can start trying to be a better person today. What lame little self-help book did you get that from? You know what? You have a wife who loves you so much. So if you can't be faithful to her, at least have the balls to leave. Don't expect me to let you coast by my class now. Already dropped it. I just have to say how totally sad and disappointing it is when certain people can't be bothered to make it to a mandatory house meeting. We were supposed to be picking this year's charity. Becky. Is that chocolate milk I see? I skipped breakfast. Ah! Mmm. Mmm! Oh, my God. That is so good. What's up with the fat fest? We're Kappas. Come on, hon. Live a little. Few calories won't kill ya. No. It'll just turn me into a chunker. Like Becky here. Okay. Oh, my God. You'll be okay. Hey, Tree. Hey. Just, uh, coming by to... What was that for? I have to run, but what are you doing later tonight? Nothing. Do you wanna take me out for my birthday? What's the punch line? Look, I know it's really random, but I promise I'll explain everything tomorrow. Assuming there is one. Just say yes. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Excuse me. Can I pay for my coffee, please? You're not gonna eat? No, just the check. Please. I'll be right back. Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late. I like your tie. Thanks. How's school? Fine. You like your classes? They're fine, Dad. I don't wanna do that anymore. Do what? Small talk. It's just that this day... This day is really hard for me. And, um... I miss Mom. You know, I miss her so much. I miss the way that she smells. I miss that crazy horse laugh she had. Yeah. Me, too. And I... I guess I thought that if I avoided all of it, if I avoided you, that somehow it would be easier, but it's not. It's been so much worse. All of this running and hiding has made me so miserable. And I think I finally figured it out. I mean, it took something totally crazy but I'm here. And I love you. And I'm so, so sorry that I hurt you. Happy birthday, baby. Stay calm. I need you to stand up, slowly. Slowly. Okay, good. Okay, this is a really bad idea. So is dying for the 16th time. Okay. Now, turn around. I need you to listen to me. He's going to escape. We can talk about this. Just put the gun down. He's going to escape. Go get help. Go! Okay. I know you're not asleep. Open your eyes. Safety's on, little girl. Ah-ah. Look what we have here. Hmm? You know... A real nice surprise, you coming to visit me like this. I like you. Damn shame. But you're a feisty little shit, ain't you? That's right. Crawl, little girl, crawl. Don't worry. I'll just make this one real quick for you, okay? Hey! Safety's off. Thanks for the tip. Who took my hair dryer? So this has got to be, like, the strangest birthday you've ever had, huh? You have no idea. Did you ever figure out how Tombs got free? No. No one knows. It's kinda like Houdini. Yeah. I guess. What are you gonna wish for? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? But isn't that kind of a given? Wanna aim for anything higher? No. Tomorrow is good enough for me. Shut up! Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. Oh. Hey, you're up- Carter? Yeah. I'm surprised you remember my name. You were pretty wasted last night. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. What? I killed him! I solved it! Who? What are you talking about? What's going on? I mean, look, you were probably just having a bad dream or something. That happens to me all the time when I'm drinking, you know, I... Nice one. Dickhead. She finally rolls in. Going somewhere? Yes. As far away as possible. Tree, what's wrong? Me. I was wrong. I thought that if I stopped running that I could beat it. But it's never gonna stop. Tree, you're freaking me out. Oh well, that's me, a freak. Tree. Tree, look. Happy birthday. Thanks, but I already ate it last night. Oh, my God. I died in my sleep. What? You killed me. What? You poisoned it. But I never ate it before. So you had to find another way. Then Tombs fell right into your lap. The perfect scapegoat. You had access to him. Did you drug him first? You knew that if he escaped everyone would assume that he killed me. But it was always you. Tree, is this a joke? You think I would actually try to poison you with a freaking cupcake? Er... Okay, then. Prove it. Go on, Lori. Take a bite. Go on, Lori. You really are crazy. Okay, then... I'll take it down to the police. I'm sure they can tell us what your little birthday treat is made of. You stupid little whore. I know I've been a bad roommate, but isn't this a bit much? What the hell? Oh, I don't know, maybe because you wouldn't stop sleeping with him. But... Gregory? But he just kept choosing you over me. Guess all he wanted was a cheap slut like you. Wait. You've been killing me over some stupid guy? Oh, that's not the only reason. You're a dumb bitch, too! But what I really wanna know is... ...how did you figure it out? Because you've killed me before. Then I guess I'm just gonna have to do it again. Stop! Bitch! No! What the hell's going on in there? Nothing. Tree just fell. Everything's fine. Whatever, clumsy hoes. I better see you at the meeting today. We'll be there. Eat it, bitch! What are you losers doing in there? Lori ate my cupcake. I just knew there was something wrong with Lori. She never wore makeup, never posted any cute selfies and she literally owned a pair of Crocs. All the signs of a psycho killer with... Hello! I'm trying to get interviewed here. Okay. Oh, my God. She is such a tool. Anyhoo... Lori's little plot was super lame- Poisoning a cupcake, really? We're Kappas. We don't eat cupcakes. Is this local or national? Local. - Hey, Dad. - Are you okay? Are you hurt? Dad, no. Dad, I'm fine. I promise. You sure? Yeah. Just a little scratched up. All right. Okay. I'll see you soon. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. So now that your bedroom is officially a crime scene and all, where do you plan on crashing tonight? Is that an invitation? You sure you want to wake up in a dorm room again? Only if it's yours. I mean, of course you'll have to sleep in Ryan's bed. Of course. Yeah. We can... Yeah. Oh! Uh... Almost forgot. You left this little guy. Thanks. You know what your little scenario reminds me of? What? What's that? Groundhog Day. The meme, Groundhog Day? I don't know. With Bill Murray? Who's Bill Murray? Are you kidding me? Ghostbusters. Sorry. I... How... I don't know. How do you sleep at night? You've never seen Groundhog Day? No. Yeah, it's my birthday. And now you gotta pick up the phone. Oh. Hey, you're up- I wasn't sure if you wanted to, uh, sleep in or not. I'm kidding. It was... It was me. I just called your phone. What? It's Tuesday, the 19th. You made it. Oh, my God. You are such a jerk! I'm gonna kill you. Hey, that's enough. What is wrong with you? That was not funny. You are such a punk. I hate you. She's back? Out. I'm not sleeping in my car again. It smells like Hot Pockets and feet. Get out. I just want clean underwear.
