A film by Paweł Łoziński I told you, not too fast. Let me see your knee. It's okay, you're fine. There's no blood, honey. Morning, do you have a moment? I'm making... if you'd please stop here for a moment. -Do what? -Stop here. -And hold that? -Hold it? No, it's too short. -What's up? -Nothing, everything's fine. I'm making a film, how are you doing? -Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not from Poland. -Even better. Really, I need to catch the 156 bus, I'm so sorry. Hello. I have a question. -Where are you going? -Home, from the river. -How was the fishing? -Not good. -Nothing? -The water's very low. -How about a quick chat? About life. -No. Because life is shit. -Please stop. I'm making a film. -Felek, you're going to be in a film! -I'm looking for film ideas. -Perfect. -Hold on, please don't run off. -I'm a terrible idea. Hello, Father, I'm making a balcony movie. Should I say something for the sound check? No, something personal. On life, the world, Poland... Would you be kind enough to...? No, not when I'm with the Holy Sacrament. I'm coming with Lord Jesus, after all. Hello, I'm doing a sound check. Would you mind stopping here? Yes, of course. What is it? -Good morning. -Good morning. I'm making a film about the people who walk past here. And...? -And I ask them questions. Do you want...? -Will you answer a question for me? -What? I'm making a film about the passersby, a metaphor for life. -A metaphor for life? -That's right. -It's good, since I'm alive. -Exactly. -Where there's life there's hope. -What would you say? -Sorry? -What would you say about yourself? As long as you're alive, you're happy, right? -Sure. Are you satisfied? -I'm happy. What about you? -It depends? -It depends. Hello, excuse me, I'm... I'm making this balcony movie about people who pass by my window, and I see you every day, but I don't think we've spoken. -No, we haven't, hello. -Could we talk? -So you live here? -That's right. -For a long time now? -Yeah, 20 years. I've only been here for two. -I'm guessing you're French? -Yes. -And what are you doing in Poland? -I work at the embassy. -Your wife is Russian, right? -Yes. -And you work for the secret service? -I work in the film service! Yes, I can see that. A bit closer, please, you've stepped out of the frame, a bit closer. I'm asking everyone who they are, what they want. You've chosen very trivial questions. Go on then. -If you've got better questions... -You ask, I'm here to give answers. -Good morning, Pani Zosia! -Good morning. -Let's go. Let's keep going. -Have you got time for a quick chat? -What sort of chat? -A short one. How short? What's new? -I'll be around here tomorrow. -And what are you up to today? Today I'm going to mow the grass at 5 Walecznych Street, at Pani Jadwiga's. You know her, right? The chatty one. -Hello, Pani Jadwiga. -Hello there. -Will you come a bit closer? -God, no, I'm in a hurry to get home. Just tell me what's new? On my way back, later, but now I must go home, someone's there waiting. Who's there waiting for you? My lover! -Hello, honey. -Hello, honey. -Short of actors? -Yes. The kind who'll stop here for a while and say something. And what would you want them to say? What have you recorded today? I'd like you to tell me how to make this film. But I already told you at home, I can't keep saying it all the time. Look what we got at the store. But I'm not sure if it's clear from this recording that you're my wife. -Haven't you introduced me? -No. My wife, Agnieszka. -Bye, honey, I love you. -Bye. -Hi, girls. -Hi, Dad. -What's up? -I'm talking to Gosia. Gosia says hi. -Say hi for me. -Dad says hi, from the balcony. Gosia, I'm filming from the balcony! Come to Warsaw, you'll be in a movie! Dad says you should come to Warsaw if you want to be in the movie. He spends all day on the balcony, impossible to get through to him. Hello, madam, hello! I'm up here, up here. Up here, please look up! Up! Here I am, hello. -Would you go over to that post? -What for? I'm making a balcony movie, talking to people who walk by. You know what, I'm deaf as a post, it's no use trying to talk to me. But I'll talk very loud to you, I promise. But I have nothing to say. I think you have a great deal to say, just take a few steps back. But what can I say? Just a little bit, that's great. Good day. Hello. I'm making a movie about people who walk below my balcony. -I ask them, "How are you?" -How am I? This old girl don't wanna die. You know... Say something about yourself. Who are you? Oh, no. My resume, or curriculum vitae in Latin, is not, how shall I put it... -Public broadcast. -I see. I've nothing to be proud of, and nothing to complain about, I'm glad of what I have. But I'd like to ask you about the meaning of life. -Am I screaming? -The meaning of life, the point? -Why do we live? -Why do we live? I wish I knew. It's a mystery to me. -So who should I ask to find out? -Definitely not me. Hello, I'm making a film here, can I stop you for a moment? -Hello. -Hello. I'm making a documentary about people. I'm looking for topics. Would you say something about yourself? -Me? About myself? -Yes. -You're very smartly dressed. -I'm a girl, obviously. -Right. -I work in architecture, design. Fashion is my greatest passion, I devote all my spare time to it. I've got my own blog, I'm growing my Instagram account, I do photo sessions. I'm totally obsessed with fashion, maybe that's why... I look like this. -I hope that's okay. -Great. I'm rushing to my friend to download the latest session we shot. -I need a hero for my film. -I don't think it's me. I doubt it. I'm off, have a nice evening. Hello, I'm not sure if you know, but the store's got some really good curtain fabric. Here? I know your wife said you were going to be redecorating. -It's the time for it. -I can bring you some curtains. If you need a lamp, I've got good taste, I'm an expert... A ceiling lamp? A ceiling lamp, I could come by... And I can furnish your flat for you, it's no problem. Great, okay. And if I did a scene like that, the audience would start to wonder: "Who's this neighbor? Is she crazy? Or nosey?" And my stage partner would now know he is a neighbor, but now they'd have decide, instantly, if he's an old neighbor who can't walk anymore, hence the neighbor's offer, or if he's young, just moved in, and she's making a pass at him, even though he's married. Or maybe he's not? Maybe he's not and he'd say to me, "She's not my wife, she's my sister," and we'd have... And now my character... I must run, but if I manage to come here for the recording I can do a lot of talking, singing and dancing. Singing, too? No one's danced for me yet. How about a little dance? 'Cos I dance salsa and bachata, but maybe in the next episode. One-two-three, one-two-three. So, darlings, I'll be back! -I'm Angela, a shout-out to you all! -Bye. Excuse me, sir, I got out of jail two days ago, could you spare some change? -I haven't got any. -Good day to you, sir. So I wander the streets of Warsaw, I don't know what to do with myself. Should go and rob something, just go back to the old path, back to jail, 'cos that's easiest. -Better not. -Yeah, better not. I've got no prospects. I took my high-school exams in jail and I've got a diploma for a tiler's apprenticeship. I dunno what's next. I've got a lot of... I came out full of enthusiasm, but a few days on, I'm full of rage and anger. I haven't been aggressive to anyone yet. -Where do you live? -On the street. Hello, excuse me, I'm making a film. Hello. -Hello. -What are you reading? -Carl Sagan. -I can't see it from here. Carl Sagan, "Billions and Billions." A highly engaging astrophysicist, sadly no longer alive. -An astrophysicist? -Yes. And what's it about? "What is mankind's place within the universe?" "Is the Earth threatened by us? Or are we a threat to ourselves?" It's about space, and about everything, in the thoughts of this wonderful man. He wrote what came into his mind. -So what do you think our place is? -Entirely accidental and tiny. We have no special place in the universe, we're like a tiny dot of chance somewhere in the ocean of unimaginable space. Hi! Hello. How are you? All right? I am a woman who, by a twist of fate, has become very happy. How did it happen? It's a secret. But now you've aroused my curiosity. It's not fair. Maybe not, but... my happiness might be someone else's unhappiness. That makes me all the more curious. Perhaps you'd reveal just a little bit? Someone has departed who caused me great pain all my life, and despite the pain, since he's gone, right now I'm happy. Someone close? Both close and distant. But like... like... -A father? -No. -Husband? -Yes. -But ex-husband? -Yes. Departed as in died or gone away? Departed and isn't here. -Simply divorced? -No. -Moved out? -No. Gone away? Crossed over to the other side. -And now life's better? -It's great. In a short time, I've achieved lots of things I never would have if I were with him. And I'm happy. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. But why? I don't get it. Because I... I don't want to give up on life, woman. And it's worth shit without a car, huh? I like my car... Hello, excuse me for bothering you... What a strange format... You stand there on your balcony, while I have to crane my neck. You like to be comfy. I have to bend over, it's giving me backache. Oh, so you're worse off than I am? -So, what's the meaning of life? -Oh dear, don't ask. -I have to go deeper. -We'd be stuck here till dark. -I've got the time. -Well, I don't. Not to discuss such a serious topic. The meaning of life is profound, but it takes time to work out. What this life is for. -Exactly. And...? -What's it for? To live for someone. -Not for oneself. -Who do you live for? For myself. -So it's not okay? -Yeah. -And you'd rather live for...? -Sorry? Who'd you rather live for? A woman? Not necessarily a woman, just someone. Another person. Children, above all. -You've got none? -No. We have to live on and search for our place. But that's the meaning for me. Unfulfilled. What's important, for instance, in marriage... People call that first infatuation "love." No, love only comes later on, once those people establish a deep connection, making them essential to each other, not in a material, physical sense, but like they're missing something in life, like air. Literally. I was fortunate to find this, but sadly, Andrzej passed on too soon. From his third heart attack. I'd gone for a walk and... -Pan Paweł, I have to go. -Thank you. You're welcome. You've got more interesting interlocutors, I'm just a chatterbox. -A bientôt! -A bientôt. Hello, I have a question, could you kindly come over, under the... hello. -We're good. -Okay. -I thought you needed sound. -I do, but I need a picture too. -I'm making a film. -What kind? -About the people who walk past here. -Oh, all right. -Who are you? -Well... I don't know, a person. What can you say about yourself? What's your story? -Sorry? -What's your story? I've been doing horse riding since I was little, competing, now I'm trying to get lucky to be able to compete again, because it costs a lot of money, but I'm good. I was a drama student, but it was too stressful, so now I'm not. -What year? -Sorry? -In what year did you quit? -The first. I left quickly. -What a lovely dog you have. -That's Lolita. I have Bibi, but she doesn't like other dogs. -Nor does mine much. -All right, I'm off. And what's that? -A toy. -Who's it for? I gave it to a girl for her birthday and it's funny. -What girl? -My girl. Cool. Now that's a story. There's always a story. OK, I'm off. -The Rosary. -The Rosary? Yes. -Do you always have it with you? -Yes, always. You have to say it at least once a day. -You do? -Yes. -And what makes the Rosary so...? -Interesting? -Yeah. -Everything, the whole of life. -Oh, wow. -Haven't you ever heard of it? I've heard about it. -And have you said it, at least once? -Me? No. I'm sorry, but... -It's all ahead of you. -You think? Sure. Of course. -And what does the Rosary give you? -It gives you strength, power... Above all, it stops you from getting lost in life. It gives peace of mind, and love, regardless of the circumstances. And it gives hope of salvation. -Nice. -The real thing. -Sounds good. -Very good. -I even feel an urge to try it. -Do it. -Three Hail Marys, today. -Okay. -Promise? -Well... I can't promise. You're closed-minded, after all. -But are you religious? -No. -No? Baptized? -No. -No? -No. -I can't believe it. -It's true. Not baptized at all? Incredible. -My parents weren't religious. -No? But how would you define your affiliation or worldview? -Agnostic. -Agnostic? But open to the metaphysical and the mystery of the absolute. -Maybe more than one. -I see. But maybe something, someone, is watching over us up there, we don't know. -I'm open to signals. -Incredible. In that case, may the grace of God come down upon you. You should make a feature film. About your project, it could be a very interesting screenplay. A guy stands on his balcony and... I mean, a guy... a filmmaker, but a guy in general, anyway, a guy who stands on the balcony and records the public's stream of consciousness, but you'd have to cast the actors well, you could make a superb feature film out of that, you could write a story into the stream of consciousness, which one passerby narrates, and it turns out he's connected with the twenty-sixth in some way. Something like that could be very interesting, in the style of Czech cinema. But very interesting. I've found one, but it's striped, I don't know if... Makes no difference, that would do, even if it had spots. -Is that the way in? -I'll throw it. Across? Can you manage? Watch it... -On the microphone... -Incredible. -You couldn't, if you tried. -All right. Jeez. -Is it okay? -A perfect fit. -We're a similar size, it's an "L." -Great. I'll fold it nicely. -It's been ironed. -I can tell. -I feel bad about it... -Don't. For the photo, it's only to here or to here anyway, for my ID card. Maybe just put it on, it won't get crumpled on you. Yeah, but I can't go around like this, I'd look... True. I've got a bag here, I won't put it in my backpack. Great. What's your name, anyway? -I'm Paweł. -I'm Robert. -Can I call you that? -I think so. -Okay. -Okay, Paweł. -My pleasure. -Thanks a lot! I'll return the shirt. -Keep it. -It's for me? -Sure! -Are you shy? -I am. Overcoming shyness is important in your profession, right? But in the street, off the cuff... There's nobody else here but you and me, it's just us. I'm recording. Beautiful! You moved me, I had shivers down my spine. I'm glad. She's badmouthing you every other day. -I can sense it. -She said you filmed her and her dog. That's possible, I've had lots of ladies with dogs here... -You're a famous local lady-killer. -No... Specializing in ladies with dogs. You better watch out for him. My wife is listening, don't say that, especially since it's not true. Are you on a prescription, only for your wife? All the women deserve nice talk, I'm not talking about some... But never with ill intentions or... To me the concept of "ill intentions" is relative. So is "betrayal." "Marital betrayal." How is that betrayal? It's not betrayal, but if someone's got that sort of nature, and likes to eat not only at home but at restaurants too, at least he's got a comparison. Goodbye! What about your husband? Did he only eat at home? I never... A woman is never sure. But he never made me feel like he would. Never! What time will you be home, honey? What time? I'll be back when I'm back. A man's basic question. Bye, bye! Hello. Hello. -Have you got a moment? -I'm in a hurry to get to the doctor. -Maybe you'd like to chat? -About...? I talk to people about life. -You've got the wrong person. -Why? Because my life is a mess, at the moment. Could you come a bit closer? Why is it a mess? It's just how it turned out. It happens. -Could you elaborate on that? -It's my birthday today and... -And... I'm feeling sad. -You're even dressed in black. No, I usually wear black. It hasn't worked out as I wanted it, and it's the second stage, where you expect everything to work out wonderfully, but it's just completely different than it used to be. Meaning...? Meaning all my plans, everything I expected from my loved ones... ...is gone. Meaning? It's completely different from what I'd expected. My whole input, my efforts, hopes, respect... everything that's essential for functioning has gone somewhere. -Whose respect? -Say again? -Whose respect? -For me. -But whose? -My loved ones. -Children? -My loved ones. -Husband? -My loved ones. -I'm off. -I'm sorry. Happy birthday from me. -Thank you very much. -Maybe tomorrow will be better. And maybe next year's will be all flowers and candles. -Maybe. -Goodbye. I did have a wife, and a second wife, I haven't got kids. So there. I don't know. You want more soul-searching? This is a bit like confession. Do you feel good in the confessional? But, you know, I'm not here as a... But you demand, I mean, maybe you don't demand, but you wish me to... I'm curious. But you don't have to answer... But I came here specially today, because lately I've been whizzing around in a hurry, so today I came because I've got a moment to talk. It's a good question, do I feel good in the confessional. Right. Because they all come by and tell you about something, and you draw them out too. Do you sleep at night? Because when you listen to all that, and you listen to a lot of people and all sorts of stories, right? Is it tough or not? So what's the point of this film? -I've been wondering too. -Got you! -Will this be in the film? -I don't know. You'd have to say something extraordinary. I love this ice cream. It's super yummy. That's an ad, this is a documentary, it has to be something real. I recommend this ice cream, it's very, very yummy. Stop, that's an ad, I'm making a documentary. -I don't know what to say, then. -Something personal. What did you dream about? I forgot. -You forgot your dream? -Sure, I did. Don't talk so loud into it. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. You're a rascal, aren't you? -Come on, say something. -But what? A rhyme. Or sing a song. -I don't know any. -What? How old are you? -How old are you? -Nine. -You don't know any songs? -I do. Go on, then. -What can I wipe this on? -Lick it off. -It's dirty. -On your shirt. But it's brand new, sir! -Hello, it's been a long time. -Hello, it has. -What's new today? -Nothing. -Impossible. -Nothing new, nothing new. Same old. So-so, the Asian flow. -Tell me about yourself. -But what would I say? I'm a widow, on my own, I can't get anything sorted at those offices unless I go there five times. You need a form, they haven't got any, so you have to get it at Grochowska Street... It's crazy. I get a referral for cataract surgery, ten different tests, and tell me why they deduct healthcare contributions from my miserable pension, which I worked hard for, when I have to pay for half the tests out of my own pocket? Why don't they let me keep those deductions, I could afford private care then. Not only must I pay, I have to wait seven years! I'll go blind before they do it. That's the real truth! So where's this state of ours? The state's a fuck-up! Record that and broadcast it. If a registered letter comes for you, registered, I have to hand it to you, and everything has to be tip-top. But if I... ...have a rattle from China for you, or a jigsaw puzzle, from China, and I come up to you, then you know what? I'm not a postman anymore, I'm a deliveryman. A deliveryman. They've turned me into a deliveryman, because they can't go to the store and buy the simplest thing. Someone has to deliver it to them. To their Lordships. I used to be a postman, and I was proud of it. I had a cap with an eagle on it, I had a uniform, a suit. And now I have to buy my own sandals. I paid 100 złotys just to have something to walk in. At the start of my career I got leather shoes, it took me three years or more to wear them out. I got leather sandals, I wore them for five years or more. But now when I get those Chinese shoes I just throw them away, 'cos they're uncomfortable, they stink of Chinese glue and they're not fit to show in public. I've got everything, I have my health, but I haven't got my best friend, who died. And that's... Who was he? He was my love. -Your love? -Yes. -Was he your partner? -Yes. And how long were you together? 40 years. Plus a bit. -Did you live together? -Yes. And how did you do that? -Like he was my brother. -Your brother? Your brother and partner? He wasn't my brother, he was my partner, but if anyone asked, he was my brother. That's how you did it. How else could we? That's what we came up with. And did people believe you? Maybe not, but I didn't have any... you know, because of it. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. See you. Thank you. I wish you the best of health and an interesting life. Thank you. -Hello! Have we had a chance to talk? -Not yet. -And could we? -Yes. Just come a touch closer to the post. -You can bring the child. -He's just gone to sleep. -Oh. I'm Paweł. -I'm Judyta. I'm making a balcony movie, asking passersby how it's going. Fine, though we were in distress just now, I had to breastfeed him, but he's fallen asleep. It's all new to me because I've had him for three weeks. -That fresh? -And we're learning to live together. -Awesome. Jesus... what's his name? -Marcel. -Marcel? Same as my father. -Amazing. Oh my... So what's it like being a mom? Awesome. I didn't think having a family would be so great. So I'm happy, in need of sleep, but it's fab. He's a "Madaddy." -Mama plus Daddy equals "Madaddy." -Madaddy. -In one person. -You're not the mama? -No, I could be these girls' granny! -Granny, come on... -We've got a granny. -They've got a granny. She's their aunt. Auntie Monika. -And where's their mom? -Not here. -In another country! -Another country... some story. -You're a rare specimen. -But a hit! You see, with a father like him, children don't need both parents. Audrey Hepburn said each child needs one person they can trust and who's going to love them. One calm parent beats two who argue. -Please get down. -Magda, don't touch. But what's it like, being a Madaddy? Crapping, shopping, mopping, every day. They keep you busy! But I see you also find time to work out. -It's a gift. -You must work out. -He's an exceptional man. -Is he? If he wanted me, I'd marry him. -I bet you get plenty of offers. -Lots. I'm very busy. So what's happened, may I ask? Going through a divorce... There's a third party involved. And that's all. She changed me for a better, newer model. -Clearly women can, too. -Yeah, anyone can. And that's it. But how are you feeling now? Not entirely... I don't know how to put it. It's just not my thing, that's all. -Was your relationship long? -15 years. Three kids. 14, 13, and the youngest, long-awaited little girl is three. Tough, we have to deal with it. I won't hang myself or throw myself under a tram, because it's pointless. It's hard, so if you ask how I'm feeling, I don't feel comfortable, I don't know what to do with myself. I just don't know. -Things got screwed up. -We drifted apart. I keep wanting to ask Iza why it... -Do I really have to say it? -I still don't know. -Why I made that decision? -Yes, please, you do. -You don't want it on film. -It's okay. I don't have a problem with it. -You don't? -No! I don't know... all right, then. I caught my husband cheating on me. -You've got great stuff! -Great stuff! And 15 years gone down the toilet. Hello, Pani Jadwiga! Hello, goodbye, I won't stop because it's raining. -All right, see you. -See you next time! Good morning. -Morning. -Do you have a moment? -Sorry? -Do you have a moment? A moment. Come over here, then. I'm making a film. -I'm in a film already? -Have you been sleeping in the car? -Yes, I have. -For long? -One night. -All night? Yes. But I'm heading out for coffee. That's me. -Good morning. -Morning. -I'm Paweł. -I'm Piotr. I didn't see you earlier, but now I do. I'm here. You didn't have your glasses. And no opportunity. -I'm here almost every day. -I bet. -Do you often sleep in the car here? -No, it was the second night. -The second night? -With you filming, I'll be back. -Seriously, will you? -Here? I don't know, we'll see. What happened? What do you think? Thrown out. -Seriously? -Yeah. -How did you mess up? -I didn't. Long story. But it's not for long. -Will you be accepted back? -The 8th time? I won't accept it. Choose your own path. Just do it out of the blue. Hello, I'm making this movie... May we have a chat? -It's about life. -About life. What? -How do you cope with life? -We were just wondering about that. -Just now? -Yes. -Any conclusions? -None, yet. Some very intimate ones so far, not entirely for the camera. -Just a little, maybe? -Maybe. For the camera. We are a patchwork family. With our histories. Five people, five worlds. -Five children or...? -Five of us. We have three daughters. -How many of them are yours? -Two. And the third one. In our family there's four of us, I'm also divorced. We're moving on somehow. I've got two daughters... And...? Is it tough or not? It depends. It is, really... It was a huge change for us, we've just moved here, so... -We're settling in. -Looking for our place. Hello, honey. Come a bit closer, you're out of frame. -That's a good thing. -How come? -Is this how you see a woman? -Burdened? Doing shopping, cooking, washing, tidying, without you noticing? Without a "thank you", you mean? No, without you noticing, as long as I stick to my role. You know, I do the shopping too. -Except now I'm on the balcony. -Exactly. -Bye. -Bye. -Cool? Perfect. -Great. -Yo, man. -No way! It's me. I didn't come on Monday because I got a job. -How's that? Jeez, I'd lost hope. -I got a job and all... Can we not record yet? Closer to the fence. No, let's record. What's been happening? I got... Everything's okay, the photos, ID application, my stuff is with the nuns on Floriańska Street, there's a church there. And I got a job, but I'm sorry, it's just too much. I'm working and sleeping in night buses. The guy said he pays once a month. And that we'll sign a contract when I show him an ID, and so on... Today I've taken the day off, I've got to tidy myself up, but everything is... you can see, sir, -I mean... -We're on first name terms. Paweł, right. Hello, I've got a quick question. -I don't speak Polish. -I do speak English. How can I help you? Listen, I got out of jail a few days ago... -Congratulations. -Excuse me? -Congratulations. -Ah, thanks a lot. And I'm trying to get myself together, and... I need a little help. Can you spare some change? I've got no złoty. I'm only here to work and then go home. I need to go to the airport and work. I've only got euro. Alright. I accept euro too. Twenty euros is my taxi home from the airport. Sorry, I'm just-- No, I'm just joking with you. -Okay. -Then I'm going home. -Okay, have a good one. -Enjoy your freedom. Alright, thanks. -Don't lose it! -I hope so, I won't. -What did he say just now? -Don't lose it. -Good morning, Pani Zosia! -Good morning. Wow! Wow! Plenty of leaves, eh? But it's fine weather, so the leaves are flying. Lucky it's not raining, or it would be harder then. -Why's that? -Because wet leaves are heavy. And more would fall. Rain would shake them off. As it is, they fall off on their own. I never met your husband. Who was he? -Who? -Your husband. But he's been dead for 21 years. Were you even here back then? Right. A fattish bloke. Januszek. Liked to hit the bottle. Yeah... Work was "yuck." I used to work at the PZO... ...the Polish Optical Works and that's where we met. He was a plumber. You know, those factory plumbers. How they used to be. Just carried spanners around, that's all. And... they liked to drink. And later, when I was forced to... because I was forced to quit the PZO and take this caretaker job, and we came here, he had it made. Completely. He worked only if he felt like it, period. And I had to work, as the caretaker. So I was sweeping and raking, and he was resting. The bottle at his side. Pani Zosia, have you got five złotys? I'd buy bread along the way. I've just got a 20. All right. It'll be 20 then. Not a thief's hand. It doesn't fit. Sure, that'll last her till the 20th. I've got five, but I'm thinking, "I'll give 20, or she'll be back tonight for another five." What's the point? My name's Piotr. I'm trying to find my place in life again. I have someone nearby who's helping me with that greatly, so I'm going to have a chat, ask a few questions and seek some answers. Can you say more about your search? It's very personal, you know. I spent 34 years living in a fog, then I decided to break free of it, and everything I'm experiencing now is entirely new to me. And I'm trying to find my way in this new life. -What sort of a fog was it? -Alcohol. I see. And how are you doing? Fine. Fine, only... I'm just trying to look at this world anew, understand it, and above all, find myself within this new world. Come to terms with myself, with my past, to be able to move on. -What's it like, being sober? -Nice. -It's good. -What are the upsides? You know, the world tastes better. And you can hear yourself better. Because you're listening to yourself, instead of sinking in alcohol to stop the pain. -Take care. Have a nice day. -Thank you, good luck. What do you want to be when you grow up? I keep changing my mind a lot, first I'd like to be this, then that, but I can't really decide, what I want to be. What was it first? First, my granny always... she really, really wanted me to be a professor. A professor of what? She always says I should be a professor, a director, but of what she doesn't say. Just that I should be one. But of what... I don't know. -Would you like that? -Yes, but it's... Sometimes wanting is not enough. Because... for instance, you haven't got the luck. -I see you're hard at work, filming. -I'm at my post. -In all kinds of weather, right? -Absolutely. I'm afraid I'm in a hurry, because despite the gloomy weather I must have my walk in Skaryszewski Park. I've got to get some fresh air. But I have some news. Right here for the viewers. -Hold on, in that case I'll zoom in. -All right. Not yet, not yet, not yet... I still have to focus the camera. Not when I'm looking like this! -I'll leave it slightly out of focus. -Do that. In two weeks and two days... my husband and I will have an addition to the family. We're going to have a little baby. -How did you hide that from me? -Sorry? How did you hide that from me? I'm such a magician I can hide it. Depends on what I'm wearing. Now you can see it a bit. -Indeed. -Two more weeks to go. Two weeks! Brilliant. Please don't put it in focus, I'm not wearing make-up, my hair's like felt. We don't want people saying pregnant women look ugly, because as you know, pregnant women can look good too. Look, Bolek, it's Lola! Lola, over there! Look up! You don't know where to look because you're such a dope. See? -It's Lolita. -That's... And there you go. -A beautiful serenade. -He's turned into a bird. -Romeo and Juliet. -Right. Oh, Lola, see what emotions you're stirring? I'll tell you what love is. I've just bought some lovely cakes. Now I'm going to close this box, get in the car and drive 500 km, and I won't eat the cake on the way, I'm just going to give it to my wonderful mom. And that is love. If that's not love, I don't know what is. -Hello. -Hello. A real pro, I see. -Robert? -Robert. -Jeez, when did I last see you? -I don't know. -In July, I guess, in the summer. -A few months ago. -How've you been? -Working, as usual. I got my ID card then. I'm laying tiles, my fingers are cracked from glue and grout, I can't even wash my head, 'cos my hands hurt so much. I've got an honest job. And shit to show for it. Paradoxically, I work all day, and beg at night for a place to sleep. And sometimes I catch a bite. I know I sound as if I'm crying, feeling sorry for myself... I'm not, I'm just burned out. I get it, penance is penance, but come on, how much can you take? -I'm making a film from the balcony. -What? I said I'm making a film from the balcony. -What's the theme? -The theme is life. -Life. -Can we talk about it? Could you come a bit closer? I have a question. What do you consider yourself as? A human being. That I can see, but... Who are you? That's what I keep asking myself. "Who am I?" I got my name from my parents. My status was ascribed by society. But there's no telling who I am. It's the question of a lifetime, and I'm seeking the answer. And what do you do? Right now? -Changing the gas meters. -The gas meters? Yes. The white roses are in bloom again Johnny, come back from your war today Come back, kiss me Like you used to do And the prettiest rose Will be my gift to you I would give, The day you left to fight For your gun, A rose so pure and white But before you even went your way Before you closed the door The rose wilted away Got it. -We're celebrating tomorrow. -Yes, we are. But not today, 'cos these leaves have to be cleared away. All right. Gentlemen, I'm making a film about various things, and today's a special day. What can you tell me? Praise be to Great Poland! You've got to be proud of being a Pole. We must represent with due respect, and take care of our own home turf. -Of our little fatherlands. -And our big fatherlands. We've got to understand that. Lots of people carry the flag without understanding why. Or how to be a patriot if there's no war, no bayonets to fix. But being a patriot means caring for... -For our little fatherland. -Work in Poland, pay taxes in Poland. Don't drink at your workplace, be a credit to Poland, respect the national emblem. Love thy neighbor. The basics. God, honor, fatherland. -I'll always fight for that. -Never forget. Historically we've always gone to battle singing "Mother of God." Not with equal rights and faggotry. -Sorry. -Sorry, it slipped out. God, honor, fatherland! God, honor, fatherland! Pride, pride, national pride! Every Pole, shout with us: "No to fucking immigrants!" Merry Christmas, Pani Jadwiga! -You too. -A very merry Christmas to you! Please don't say that. Don't wish me that. -So what can I wish you? -A nice Christmas. How can I be merry without my beloved husband? Show some tact. A nice Christmas then. Thanks for putting me in a good mood. I'm sorry, maybe I can start again? Hello, honey. Did you film the first snow? -Yes. -Good. -Coming for a walk with us? -I can't. Set the camera, press the button and come on down. -I've got to work. -This is work too. Look how happy she is. Lola! Hello! -I'm looking for a hero for my film. -Sorry? -I'm looking for a hero for my film. -Oh dear, no. Why not? -I haven't got the self-confidence. -This could help you to gain some. Absolutely. -You mean the film you're making now? -Yes. -And do you mean this conversation? -Yes, sure. Be my guest. -Come on! -I can try. -Yes. -Just don't be surprised if I leave. I have a question. Will you make a film out of these conversations? -Yes, I edit them. -Are you a film editor? That too, sometimes. More of a director. And who are you? I'm uncomfortable. But why? The situation is quite... Because I'm not so precisely defined. Meaning? I do various things but I don't know if I'm this or that. What or who. But what do you consider yourself to be, most of all? A person whom I'm have not fully become yet. I am almost that person. And what's your name? My name... I do have a name. I'm Paweł. For example. I'm Paweł. And I am Agnieszka. The same as my wife. A lovely name. And what are your dreams? No, I can't just tell you that. Do you really think you can just ask... I guess you have no difficulty communicating, right? You probably have no trouble making contact, that's why you can ask a direct question and expect an answer. Am I pestering you? I'm pleased I had the courage to speak to you at all. I was pleased I spoke to you at all, I thought I wouldn't be able to cope with the stress. But it turns out I can respond to someone who decides to... ...to fish me out, so to speak. I'm also glad you let yourself be persuaded. But what will come of it now? -Hello. -Hello. -How's your health? -A bit better. -What's that? -A bit better. But still... The cough... -It's still there. -But you've got to work. -True. -Unfortunately. The snow comes and goes. What can you do? It needs sweeping. Getting up early is not a problem? -It's easier than in the summer. -Is it? Because when I look outside and see all the snow, oh dear. You'd be up at 2:00 a.m., and you're in the window till 2:00 a.m., watching. It's snowing, it's not. It is, it's not. So out you rush, on you go! Bolek! Bolek. Hi. Hi Bolek. You're going to be a daddy! -Is he? -Yes. -Do you know how many babies? -Six, so far. -Six! -Yes. -There are six. -Bolek! Bolek, damn! -How touching. -Very, for me. For me too. How long's the pregnancy? The Warsaw Uprising. -Until August the 1st? -No. 63 days? Right. Good day, madam. I'm making this film from the balcony, you know? -Sorry? -Good day. Good day, what? I'm making this film, you know. I ask each person what's new, I'm looking for a hero for my film. -Oh no, I'm no hero, you see. -Why not? Why? Because I've grown old. You need someone young and courageous. But why? People with experience... Someone with good ideas for life, and I've got only ideas for death. -What ideas for death have you got? -No good ones, I'm afraid. -Not even for death. -But what do you have in mind? Let's say, I'm waiting for a surge of ingenuity. Meaning? Meaning the attempt has to be successful, because if it's not, things get even worse. -Thinking along those lines, are you? -Not thinking, experiencing. I regret showing Andrzej, my husband, too little love. That sometimes... I'm more of the kind... I hide my emotions. I've only eased up a bit in my old age, but I really regret that I wasn't... I didn't take all those opportunities to show him my love, true love, not the husband and wife nonsense, because that's not me. -So... all right, goodnight. -Goodnight. Do you know the song, "Goodnight, I hope you dream of me all night..." That was addressed to Andrzej, not to you. I hope I dream of him. I often do, and it's already... 12... 13 years in July since he died. Paweł! Paweł! It's just... I've lost all the values that were instilled in me as a child... And my mom really did bring me up well, to be a decent person. But it all burst like a soap bubble, in a single moment. -And later on... -At what moment? I don't know, maybe... it was the moment when I first hurt a man, physically. -What did you do to him? -I broke his leg. -With what? -A metal pipe. Why? 'Cos he owed money to this other lad. But I didn't go to jail for that. -And what happened next? -Sorry? You broke his leg, and then what? After that I came along once a week and he paid me the money. I recovered the whole debt and got a provision. I remember it, I have dreams about it at night. I suffer because of it. I feel sorry for that man. -Did you go to see him? -What, to apologize or something? No, come on. But I want to... ...pass on as a decent man, not as trash, a drunk... ...and a criminal. You have no idea how I envy you... ...like, for the situation you're in. You're loved, you've got warmth, you've got a home, a family... ...a dog. Stability in life. Cherish it. -Hello, neighbor. -Hello. Stanisław, please show yourself to the camera. It's not his first film take, he's been in "Under the Surface." -Acted. -Already? Yes, he played a newborn baby. In other words, himself. -That's the best. -He has just sunk into sweet sleep. I'll go a step further. While you're little... I'll take him out. -Staś is beautiful. -In 20 years you will film a sequel. -Right. -Baby, show yourself to the camera. There he is. When you release this documentary, or series about us in Saska Kępa, I wonder how tall Staś will be then? How big will you be then? -Pan Paweł! -Over here. I feel really sick, but I have to go to the doctor or I'd have to wait till Thursday. I'm fit as a fiddle, only here... It's probably something with my hindbrain. Not the brain, luckily. You'll be here tomorrow? -Yes. -I'll come by. Okay. -I'm walking like my own granny. -You're not! -Oh, really? -You're speeding! My mood's better already! -A bientôt, Monsieur! -A bientôt, Madame! -Pani Ania, the meaning of life. -What? -What did you say? -Pan Paweł's asking. -What? -What's the meaning of life? The meaning of life? Life is meaning. That's enough. Life is meaning. Because if it has no meaning, why on earth live? We would like to thank all the passersby who confided in us.
