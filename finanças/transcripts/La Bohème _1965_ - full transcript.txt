This Red Sea freezes me into numbness... as if water were falling on me drop by drop. To revenge myself, I'll make Pharaoh drown! What are you doing? I'm watching the Parisian chimneys smoking in the Grey skies... and thinking of that lazy old swindling stove... living in idleness like a lord! He hasn't received his lawful dues for a long time. Those silly forests, what do they do under the snow? Rodolfo, I'll tell you a profound thought: I'm freezing cold. And I, Marcello, don't believe in the sweat of the brow. My fingers are as frozen... as if they were locked in that ice-box which is Musetta's heart. Love is a fire which wastes too much... and too quickly... - where Man is the firewood... - and Woman is the firedog. - One burns in a flash. - And the other looks on. - Meanwhile we're freezing... - and dying of hunger! We must have a fire. Wait. We'll sacrifice the chair! Eureka! - You've found something? - Yes! A splendid idea. Let thought burst into flame. - Shall we burn the Red Sea? - No. Painted canvas stinks. My drama, let my burning drama warm us. Do you mean to read it? I'd freeze. No, let the paper flake into ashes and the spirit soar to the skies. A great loss threatens posterity. - Rome is in peril! - Noble gesture! You take act one - Right. Tear it up. Light it. What a cheerful spark! Signs of the Apocalypse are already appearing. On Christmas Eve they won't accept pledges! - A blaze! - Quiet. - They're giving my play... - to the fire. I find it brilliant - Lively. But it doesn't last long. Brevity is a great virtue. Author, give me the chair. These intervals are very tiresome. Quick! Act two. Not a whisper. - Profound thought! - Perfect amour! In that blue languishing flicker an ardent love scene goes up in smoke. A page crackles. There were kisses there! Let's hear all three acts at once. That's the bold stroke of genius. Great to vanish in a joyous flash. The flame's already dying down. What a vain, fragile drama! It's crinkling, crackling and dying already! Down with the author! - Wood! - Cigars! Bordeaux! Fate has destined a feast for us. The Bank of France has beggared itself for you. - Pick 'em up! - They're pieces of tin! Are you deaf? Or blind? Who's this man? Louis-Philippe! I bow to my King! Louis-Philippe is at our feet! Now I'll tell you. There's a fine story to this gold, or rather, silver. - Let's warm up the stove! - It's suffered such cold! An English gentleman, lord or nobleman whoever it was... - wanted a musician. - Let's lay the table! - Where's the tinder? - There I present myself. He accepts me, I ask him: "When do we start the lessons?" I present myself, he accepts me, I ask him: "When do we start the lessons?" He answers: "Let's start!" "Look!" And he points to a parrot on the first floor. Then adds: "You play fill that dies!" - The room shall shine with lights. - I played three whole days. Then I exercised the charm of my personality dazzling the maid. Do we eat without a tablecloth? - An idea! - The "Constitutional"! An excellent sheet. We eat and devour the supplement! Lorito stretched his wings. Lorito opened his beak. A scrap of parsley and he died like Socrates! - Who? - The devil the the lot of you! And now what are you doing? No! These victuals are in store... for the dark and gloomy days ahead. Dine at home on Christmas Eve... while the streets of the Latin Quarter... are festooned with sausages and titbits? When the smell of fritters... pervades those old streets? There girls are singing happily. On Christmas Eve! And each has a student for echo. Let's observe tradition, gentlemen. We'll drink at home, but let's eat out! May I come in? - Who is it? - Benoît! The landlord! Bolt him out. There's no one here. We're closed. One word. Only one! Rent! Here! Give him a chair. - Quickly. - Don't bother. I only want... Sit down - Have a drink. Thank you - Cheers. - Drink up. - This is the last quarter I'm glad to hear it. - And so... - Another little drop. Thank you - Cheers. To your good health! I come to you because last quarter you promised... I made a promise and I'll keep it. - What are you doing? - Are you mad? Do you see? Come on now, stay with us for a bit. Tell me, how old are you... - my dear Benoît? - How old? I beg you! Our age, more or less. More, much more. He said more or less. The other evening at the Bal Mabille he was caught flirting I? He was caught the other evening at the Mabille. Deny it! By accident. - A pretty woman! - Ah, very! - Rascal! - Seducer! - Stout fellow! Stalwart chap! - He's got good taste. That curly red hair - Rascal! He strutted about, all pompous and bumptious - I may be old, but I'm sturdy. - He strutted with his chest out. And feminine virtue yielded to him I was a shy young man. But now I'm making up for it. You know, I have a weakness for women who are lively... and a bit... I don't mean fat like whales or globes... or round full-moon faces. But scrawny, really scrawny, no, never! Scrawny women are a headache and often a bore. And they're full of aches and pains. - For instance... - Who? My wife. This man has a wife yet hides foul desires! And taints and infests our decent abode! - We must fumigate the room. - Get rid of the reprobate. - Outraged morality expels you! - Silence! - Gentlemen... - Silence! Out, sir! Out of here! Good evening to your Lordship. That settles the quarter's rent. In the Latin Quarter Momus awaits us. - Long live the spendthrift! - Let's divide the spoils! Let's divide them! There are beauties there dropped straight from heaven. Now you're rich, observe the decencies! Tidy your hair, bear I'll make the acquaintance of a barber for the first time. Lead me to the ridiculous outrage of a razor. Let's go! I'll stay... to finish the leading article for "The Beaver". Be quick. Five minutes. I know the job. We'll wait for you downstairs. If you're late, you'll hear a chorus! Five minutes. Cut your "Beaver's" tail short! Mind the stairs. Hold on to the banisters. Careful! - It's pitch dark. - Confounded concierge! Damn! Colline, are you dead? - Not yet! - Come quickly! I'm not in the mood. Who's there? Excuse me. A woman! - Plus. My light has gone out. - Coming. Would you? - Sit down for a moment. - I mustn't stay. Please come in. Aren't you well? No, it's nothing. You're turning pale! My breathing, those stairs. And now what do I do? There! How in she looks! - Do you feel better? - Yes. It's so cold here. Sit by the fire. Wait. A little wine - Thank you. There you are - Only a little. - So? - Thank you. What a pretty young girl! Let me light my candle. I'm feeling better now. Are you in a hurry? Yes. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Oh! How careless of me! Where did I leave the key of my room? Don't stand in the doorway. The wind is making the candle flicker. Oh dear! Light it again. Oh dear! Mine's gone out too! - But where's my key? - It's pitch dark! - Unhappy me! - Where can it be? I'm a tiresome neighbour. Not at all! Yes, I'm a tiresome neighbour. Not at all, I assure you! Look for it I'm looking. Where can it be? - Ah! - Have you found It? No! I thought you did - So did I. Are you looking? I'm looking! What a frozen little hand! Let me warm it for you. What's the use of looking? We shan't find it in the dark. But luckily it's a moonlight night, and the moon is near us here. Wait, mademoiselle, I will tell you in two words... who I am, what I do, and how I live. May I? Who am I? Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live. In my carefree poverty... I squander rhymes and love-songs like a lord. When it comes to dreams and visions and castles in the air... I've the soul of a millionaire. Yet sometimes all the jewels in my safe... are stolen by two thieves: A pair of pretty eyes. Even now yours steal in, and my customary dreams... my cherished dreams quickly vanish. But the theft doesn't upset me... for their place has been taken by hope! Now that you know me, it's your turn to speak. Tell me who you are. Will you say? Yes. They call me Mimi, but my name is Lucia. My story is brief I embroider linen or silk, at home and outside I'm contented and happy... and it's my pleasure to make roses and lilies. I love those things which weave so sweet a spell... which speak of love, of springtime... which speak of dreams and visions... those things that people call poetic. Do you understand? Yes. They call me Mimi, I don't know why. All alone I prepare my own meal I don't always go to Mass, but I pray diligently to God. I live all on my own... there in a little white room overlooking the roofs and the sky. But when the thaw comes, the first sunshine is mine. April's first kiss is mine! The first sunshine is mine. In a vase a rose is coming into bloom. Petal by petal I watch it! The scent of a flower is so sweet! But the flowers I make, alas... the flowers I make have no smell! There's no more I can tell you about myself I am your neighbour who comes to bother you at the wrong moment. - Hey! Rodolfo! - Hallo! Can't you hear? - Slowcoach! - Poetaster! Down with lazybones! I'm dashing off three more lines. - Who are they? - Friends. You'll catch it! What are you doing there all alone? I'm not alone. There are two of us. Go on to Momus's, keep a place, we shan't be long. Momus, Momus, Momus, silent and discreet let's be off. He's found his inspiration - O gentle maid. - He's found his inspiration O sweet face suffused with the light of the rising moon... in you I recognise the dream I'd like to dream for ever! My soul's already a-throb with the sweets of passion. Love, alone command me! Oh, how sweetly his flattery falls upon my heart. - Love, alone command me! - Love trembles in a kiss! No, I beg you! You're mine! Your friends are waiting for you. Are you sending me away already? - I'd like to say. But I dun not. - Tell me. Suppose I came with you? What? Mimi! It would be lovely to stay here. It's cold outside. I shall be near you! - And when we return? - Wait and see! Give me your arm, my dearest I obey, my lord! Say you love me I love you! My love! Oranges, dates! Hot chestnuts! Trinkets, crosses! Nougat! - Whipped cream! - Oh! Fruit pies! - What crowds! - Come on, let's hurry! Hang on to me! What a din! Make way! Let's run! - Dates, oranges! Coconut milk! - What a crowd! Let's be off! Ah! Make way there! - Quickly here! Waiter! A glass! - What a crush! - Hang on to me, let's run! - I want a spear! - Coconut milk! Coats! Carrots! - Dates, oranges and flowers! That D's out of tune! Pipe and horn, how much? - It's a little worn. - Shall we get the bonnet? - But it's sound and cheap. - Keep tight hold of my arm I'll cling on to you. Let's go! I feel like shouting: Which of you pretty ladies would care for a bit of love? - Dates! Trout! - Plums from Tours! Let's play together at buying and selling! I'll give my virgin heart for a sou! Shoving and bustling, the crowd delights in mad, unsatisfied joys. Flowers for the pretty girls! A rare copy, unique even: The runic grammar! - Where's Rodolfo? - He went into a milliner's. Come, our friends are waiting. Does this pink bonnet suit me? You're dark, that colour suits you. What a lovely coral necklace! I have a millionaire uncle. If the good God has any sense... I'll buy you a much finer necklace than that! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Let's follow the crowd! - Look out, girls! - What a din! - Let's take the Rue Mazarin! - I'm suffocating, let's go! - The Café's just there! - Let's go to Momus's! Who are you looking at? - I hate vulgarity, like Horace. - Are you jealous? A man in love is easily jealous. And when I feed I like plenty of room. - Are you happy? - Oh yes! So happy! - And you? - Yes, very! - To Momus's! - Let's go! Quick! Here come Parpignol's toys! Two chairs. - At last! - Here we are. This is Mimi, merry flower-girl. Her arrival completes the fine company... for I am the poet and she the poetry. From my brain burst songs. From her fingers burst flowers. From our exultant souls bursts love! Heavens, what rare fancies! She is worthy to enter. Let her come in, if she must. I can only say: Agreed! Here come Parpignol's toys! - Sausage! - Parpignol, Parpignol! Here comes Parpignol with his decorated cart! Here's Parpignol! I want the trumpet, the little horse, the drum, the tambourine I want the gun, the whip, the platoon of soldiers. - Roast venison! - A turkey! - Rhine wine! - Table wine! Dressed lobster! You pack of ragamuffins! What are you doing here? Home to bed, you ugly little brutes! A good hiding's nothing to you! I want the trumpet and the little horse! - And what would you like, Mimi? - Cream pudding. And a grand spread. There's a lady with us! Hurrah for Parpignol! The drum, the tambourine! The platoon of soldiers! Mademoiselle Mimi, what rare gift has your Rodolfo given you? A lace bonnet, all embroidered in pink. It goes well with my dark hair. For ages I've been wanting a bonnet like this. And he read what was hidden in my heart. He who can see into a heart knows the ways of love. An experienced professor... who already has diplomas and whose verses are not early attempts. So much so that what he says seems true O happy age of illusions and utopias! One believes and hopes and everything seems lovely! The most divine poetry, my friend, is that which teaches us to love! Love is even sweeter than honey! Depending on taste, it's honey or poison! Oh dear! I've hurt his feelings! He's in mourning, Mimi darling. Let's be merry. A toast! Let's have a drink! Away with sad thoughts, up with your glasses! Let's drink! Let's drink! Let me drink poison! Oh! Musetta! Look! Yes! It's Musetta! We're in luck! What a get-up! Running here and there like a porter. No, I won't put up with it! - Come, Lulu! - I've had enough! That ugly fellow seems to be sweating! What? In here? Sit, Lulu! Please reserve such nicknames for tête-à-têtes! Don't be such a Bluebeard! - Here is vice dignified. - With the chaste Susanna! - She's well dressed though! - The angels go naked. You know her! Who is she? Ask me that. Her name is Musetta. - Marcello has seen me. - Surname: Temptation! But he won't look at me, the beast! That Schaunard's laughing! She often changes lovers and love. - They all annoy me! - Like the owl she is a bird of prey. If I could hit them! If I could scratch them! But I have nothing to hand but this old pelican! She eats hearts! That's why I've none any more. Pass the stew! Here! Waiter! This plate stinks of frying! No, Musetta. Quiet! - He won't turn round! - Quiet! Behave! - Now I'll hit him! - To whom are you talking? To the waiter! Don't be a nuisance! - I want to do as I please. - Speak softly! - I'll do as I like! - Speak softly! Don't be a bore! Look who's here, Musetta in person! With that stammering old boy! She, Musetta, herself! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Can he be jealous of this mummy? Let's see if I still have the power to make him give in. A stupendous farce! You don't look at me! You can see I'm ordering! A stupendous farce! Stupendous! For your future guidance, bear in mind I would never forgive you. She speaks to one, so the other can hear I love you so much and I'm yours alone! And the other is stern in vain. He pretends not to understand, but is in heaven! - But your heart is hammering! - Speak softly! - Your hurt I: Hammering! - My! When I walk out alone along the street, people stop and stare. And they seek out my beauty from head to foot. Tie me to the chair! What will those people say? Then I relish the sly desire which shines from eyes... and can infer hidden beauties from outward charms. Thus the breath of desire whirls around me... and makes me happy! - That scurrilous song enrages me! - And you who know... - who remember and fret... - I know full well that poor girl... - why do you shun me like that? - Is very much in love. I know full well you'll not tell your sufferings. She's terribly in love with Marcello I know you would rather die than speak of your torment! What will those people say? - Marcello used to love her. - Marcello will give in. - The coquette left him. - Who knows what will happen. - She wanted to enjoy an easier life. - The snare is equally sweet... - for the hunter and the quarry. - Into such trouble... Colline will never fall! - Ah! Marcello is uneasy. - Speak softly! - Marcello is beaten! - Do be quiet! She's pretty, I'm not blind. That swaggerer will give way at any moment! But I much prefer a pipe and a Greek text! - A selfish love is a bad love! - A dead love never revives! If a pretty girl like that were to engage you tête-à-tête... you'd send your grumbling maxims to the devil! Don't interfere! Now I must get rid of the old man! What's wrong? - What a pain! What agony! - Where? In my foot! Undo it, untie it! Tear it, break it! Please! My youth, you're not dead, neither is the memory of you! Curse that tight shoe! I want another pair! If you were to knock at my door, my heart would fly to open it! Now I'll take it off. There it is! Run along! Quickly, go on! Marcello! Siren! We've reached the final scene! The bill? So soon? Who asked for it? Let's see! Expensive! Out with your money! Colline, Rodolfo and you, Marcello? - The Tattoo! - We're broke! - What? - I've thirty sous in all! Isn't there any more? But where has my treasure gone? Are they coming this way? - Give me my bill. - No, that way! They're coming that way! - This way! - No, that way! - Good! - Make way! I want to see! I want to hear! Quick, add that bill on to mine! Mother, I want to see! The gentleman who was here with me will pay! They're coming this way! Yes, this way! When they come we'll march with them! And where he was sitting he'll find a greeting from me! And where he was sitting he'll find a greeting from her! Make way, here they come! Mind the old man doesn't see us running off with his prey! This dense crowd is a ready hiding-place! Here comes the drum major! Prouder than a warrior of old! - The drum major! - Quickly! The Sappers, hooray! Here comes the drum major! The Tattoo is here! Here he is! The handsome drum major! The golden mace, so splendid! He looks around and goes by! Such splendour! The handsomest man in France! Here is the handsome drum major! He looks around and goes by! Hey, you guards! Open up! Hey there! You from Gentilly! We're the sweepers! It's snowing. Hey there! We're freezing here! I'm coming! He, who in drinking has found pleasure in his glass... ah! In the warmth of a kiss has found love! Ah! If pleasure lies in the glass, love lies in young lips! “Ha ha, ha ha, Eve and Noah! Hallo there! It's the milkmaids already! Good morning! Butter and cheese! Chickens and eggs! Which way are you going? To Saint-Michel! See you later? At noon! Would you tell me which is the inn where a painter is at work? Over there - Thank you. Would you be kind enough, madam, to find the painter Marcello for me? I have to speak to him. I'm in such a hurry. Tell him quietly that Mimi's waiting for him. Let's see that basket! - Empty! - Pass! Mimi! I was hoping to find you here. We've been here a month at the innkeeper's expense. Musetta teaches singing to the patrons. I am painting those warriors on the façade. It's cold. Come inside. - Is Rodolfo here? - Yes. - I can't go in! - Why? O good Marcello, help me! What's happened? Rodolfo loves me and avoids me. My Rodolfo is consumed with jealousy. A step, a word, a necklace, a flower can make him suspicious... so that he is vexed and angry. Sometimes at night I pretend to be asleep... and I can feel his eyes upon me, spying on my dreams. He constantly cries: "You're no good to me". "Find yourself another lover, you're no good to me!" Alas! Alas! It's the fury talking inside him, I know. But what can I answer him, Marcello? Two people like you shouldn't live together. You're right, we must part. Help us, oh, do help us. - We have often tried, but in vain. - I'm happy with Musetta. And she's happy with me, because we love light-heartedly. Singing and laughter are the flowers of lasting love! Do what you can for the best I will! I'll wake him now. Is he asleep? He landed here an hour before dawn. He fell asleep on a bench. Look. What a cough! Since yesterday it's been painful. He left me last night, saying: "It's all over". At daybreak I set out and came here. He's waking, getting up, looking for me. He's coming. He mustn't see me! Go home now, Mimi, for goodness' sake! Don't make a scene here! Marcello, at last! No one can hear us here. I want to leave Mimi. Are you so fickle? Once before I believed my heart was dead. But at the splendour of those blue eyes it revived. Now boredom assails it. And you want to renew the funeral? - For ever! - Change your tune. The gloomy love which ends in tears is madness. If it doesn't laugh and sparkle, love is feeble and gruff. - You're jealous... - A little touchy, moody, full of prejudices, tiresome... - headstrong! - He'll make him angry! Poor me! Mimi's a coquette who flirts with everybody. Some dandy of a Viscount makes eyes at her. She lifts her skirts and shows her ankle... in a most provocative and encouraging way. Must I say it? I don't think you mean all that. Very well, I don't. In vain I hide my real torment. I love Mimi more than anything in the world. I love her, but I'm afraid! Mimi is so very ill! Every day she grows weaker. - The poor little thing is doomed! - Mimi? What does he mean? A terrible cough shakes her weak frame. Her pale cheeks are flushed. - Poor Mimi! - Alas, must I die? My room is a squalid den I've no fire. The cold north wind blows in and whistles around. She sings and smiles, and remorse assails me I am the cause of this fatal illness which is killing her! - What's to be done? - O my life! - Mimi is a hot-house plant. - Oh, how pitiful! - Poverty stripped her of her flowers. - Poor little thing! To recall her to life... - love is not sufficient! - Poor Mimi! What? Mimi! You here? - She was listening, then! - Did you hear everything? An easy prey to fear, I get in a state about nothing. - Come into the warm! - No, that fog suffocates me! Ah, Mimi! That's Musetta laughing. Who with? Ah, you flirt, I'll teach you! Farewell. What? Are you going? Whence happily she came at your call of love... Mimi will return to her lonely nest. She'll return once again to embroidering imitation flowers. Farewell... and no hard feelings. Listen. Gather up the few things I left about. Shut in my drawer... is that little gold ring and my prayer book. Bundle everything up in an apron... and I'll send the concierge. Under the pillow you'll find the pink bonnet. If you want to, keep it as a souvenir of our love! Farewell. Farewell, and no hard feelings. So, it's all over! You're leaving me, my little one. Farewell, dreams of love! Farewell, sweet wakings in the morning! - Farewell, life of dreams! - Farewell, discord and jealousy... that a smile from you would appease! - Farewell, suspicions... - kisses... stinging bitterness... that I, like a true poet, would rhyme with tenderness! To be alone in winter is a terrible thing! Alone! But in spring there is the sun for companion! - What were you saying to that man? - What do you mean? - Nobody is alone in April. - When I arrived you changed colour. That gentleman was asking me: "Do you like dancing, mademoiselle?" You vain, frivolous flirt! Blushing I replied: "I'd dance from dusk till dawn". - Such talk hides dishonest aims. - I want to be absolutely free! I'll give you a good hiding if I catch you flirting! What are you on about? We're not even married. Take care, under my hat I don't wear horns I detest those lovers who go on like husbands I'll not be a laughing-stock for your enterprising novices I'll make love with whom I please! Don't you like it? - Musetta's off, yes, she's off! - You're off? I'm duly grateful. The evening breeze spreads balm on human ills. Good bye. I bid you goodbye with the greatest of pleasure, sir! Would you like us to await the coming of spring once more? - Housepainter! - Viper! - Toad! - Witch! Always yours, for life. We'll part when the flowers bloom again I'd like winter to last for ever! We'll part when the flowers bloom again! In a brougham? With a pair and livery. She greeted me, laughing. "Well, Musetta! And how's your heart?" I said. "It isn't beating, or I don't feel it, thanks to the velvet that covers it" I'm really glad to hear it! Go on with you, Jesuit! You grin and bear it. Not beating? Good! - I too saw... - Musetta? Mimi. You saw her? Oh, fancy that! She was in a carriage, dressed like a queen. Hurray! I'm pleased about that. The liar, he's dying of love. Let's work - Let's work. Confounded pen! Confounded brush! O Mimi, you will return no more O happy days, tiny hands, sweet-scented tresses. I don't know why my brush slaps on colours against my will. Ah! Mimi, my short-lived youth! If I want to paint skies or landscapes or winter or spring... my brush paints for me... two dark eyes... and provocative lips. And there is Musetta's face again. Meanwhile, Musetta's enjoying life and my craven heart calls her. And you, dainty bonnet, which she left hidden under her pillow... you know all our happiness. Come to my heart, to my broken heart. Ah, come to my heart, for love is dead. What time might it be? Yesterday's dinner time. And Schaunard isn't back? Here we are. - Well? - Well? - Bread? - A dish worthy of Demosthenes. A herring - Salted. Supper is served. This is a veritable feast of plenty. Now let's put the champagne on ice. Choose, baron, trout or salmon? Duke, a parrot's tongue? No, thank you, it's fattening. I'm going to a ball tonight. Finished already? I'm in a hurry. The king expects me. - Is there a plot on? - Some mystery? A mystery? A mystery? The king has summoned me to the ministry. Splendid! However I shall see Guizot! - Give me the goblet! - Yes, drink, I'm gorging myself! I beg the noble company to permit me... - Stop it! What a concoction! - It's feeble! Off with you! I am irresistibly inspired by the spirit of song! No! A choreographic exploit then? Yes! Yes! Dancing with vocal accompaniment! Clear the room. Gavotte. Minuet - Pavane. Fandango. I suggest a quadrille. Take your partners I'll call. Lallera, lallera, lallera, la. Pretty maiden. Respect my modesty, I beg of you. Balancez! The Rond comes first. No, stupid! What disgusting behaviour! If I'm not mistaken you're being offensive. - Draw your sword. - Ready. On guard I'm thirsting for your blood. One of us will be disembowelled. Prepare a stretcher. Prepare a cemetery. While the duel is raging, the rigaudon whirls on. Musetta! Mimi's following me and she's not well. - Where is she? - She couldn't manage the stairs. Let's bring the bed up. Get her a drink Rodolfo! Hush. Rest quietly O my Rodolfo! Do you want me here with you? Ah! My own Mimi, always! I heard it said that Mimi, having left the Viscount, was dying. Where was she living? I searched and searched. Then I saw her pass in the street... hardly able to crawl. She said: "I can't go on". "I'm dying! I feel it" "I want to die with him. Perhaps he's waiting for me." I feel much better. "Will you come with me, Musetta?" Let me look round. Ah, how nice it is here! I feel stronger every moment. - I feel life again here. - Dear lips. - No, you will leave me no more! - You speak to me again! Is there coffee or wine to give her? Nothing! Ah, what it is to be poor! She'll be dead in half an hour I'm so cold! If only I had a muff! Shall I never be able to warm these hands of mine? Here, in mine! Keep quiet! Talking tires you I've a bit of a cough. I'm used to that. Hello, Marcello. Schaunard, Colline, hello. All of you here smiling at Mimi. Do not talk I'm talking softly, don't worry. Marcello, believe me: Musetta is so very good I know it. Take these. Sell them and bring a cordial, call a doctor! Rest. - You won't leave me? - No! Listen! This may be the very last time she'll express a Wish, poor thing! I'll see to the muff I'll come with you. You're so good, my Musetta. Dear old coat, listen I stay here below, but you must now ascend the mount of piety. Receive my thanks. You never bent your threadbare back to the rich and powerful. You have sheltered in your pockets... like peaceful caves. Philosophers and poets. Now that happy days have fled... I bid you farewell, my faithful friend. Farewell, farewell. Schaunard, each in his own way... let us put two acts of charity together I with this! And you... leave them alone there! Philosopher, you are right! It is so! I go! Have they gone? I pretended to be asleep... because I wanted to be left alone with you I've so many things to tell you... or rather only one, but that one huge as the ocean... as deep and infinite as the sea. You are my love and my whole life! Ah, Mimi, my beautiful Mimi! Am I still beautiful? Beautiful as the dawn. You're mistaken in your comparison. You meant: Beautiful as the sunset. They call me Mimi. They call me Mimi, I don't know why. The swallow's returned to the nest and is chirping. My little bonnet! Do you remember when I came here for the first time? Do I remember! My light had gone out. You were so concerned! Then you lost the key. And you began groping about to find it! And I searched and searched. My handsome young sir, I can say it now: You found it quite soon. I was helping fate. It was dark and you couldn't see me blushing. "What a frozen little hand! Let me warm it for you." It was dark and you took my hand. Oh God! Mimi! What's happened? Nothing. I'm all right. Keep quiet, for pity's sake! Yes, yes, forgive me. I'll be good now. - Is she asleep? - She's resting I've seen the doctor. He's coming. I hurried him up. Here's the cordial. Who's talking? Me, Musetta. Oh, how lovely and soft it is! My hands will no longer be frozen. The warmth will make them beautiful. - Did you give it me? - Yes. You spendthrift! Thank you. But it must have been expensive. You're crying? I'm all right. Why are you crying like that? Here, my love... with you always! My hands... in the warm... and... to sleep. - What did the doctor say? - He'll come. Blessed Virgin, grant thy grace to this poor soul... that she may not die. We need a guard here, the flame is flickering. Like that. And that she may be cured. Holy Virgin, I am unworthy of pardon... but Mimi is an angel from heaven. I still hope. Do you think she's in danger? I don't think so. Marcello, she's dead. Musetta, take this! - How is she? - See, she's quite peaceful. What's all this coming and going? Why are you looking at me like that? Be brave!
