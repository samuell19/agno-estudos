[MUSIC - ARNETIA WALKER, "PLAYING WITH FIRE"] DIANE: The theme of Macbeth is ambition. Murder for ambition. Macbeth wanted to become the king. His ruthlessly ambitious wife, Lady Macbeth, urged him to murder is king so that she could become queen. All right, now let's see what you come up with on your papers. Glenn? Dr. Stevens, you want us to write about what happened after everybody got bumped off? [laughter] Yes, and please use the correct word, murder. What's the difference? Dead is dead. Yeah, you ought to know. [laughter] All right, that's enough now. Everyone have a nice weekend, and I'll see you all next Tuesday. I'd like to speak to you, please. Me? No, Jay. Are you still looking for work? Oh, yeah. Come and see me in my office. Jay. Jay, hi. Everybody's coming over to my house tonight to study for the finals. You want to come? I can't make it. Why not? Something came up. Oh. Hey, Cynthia. Do you want to go out with me? Get lost, Bird. Bitch. Hey, Jay, wait up. Can I borrow your key? I lost mine again. Yeah, I need It back. Thanks to admissions for finding me a roomie like you. Three keys in three months? Look, I've got a date, OK? All right? Really? Yeah, can I borrow a 10? A date with who? Cynthia. Only in your fantasies, Bird. Good luck. Hey, four is all I got. Four, thanks. What time are you coming home? I don't know, Ma. Oh, you've been a bad boy? Got to stay after school with teacher? Hey, she just-- - Yeah. --needs me to do some work for her. - Oh, yeah right. - You guys are imagining things. Have a little, class. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A little piece of class. Hey, knock it off. See you later, guys! Hey, I bet he's going to work real hard. Jealous, you're jealous. Come on, can we get the hell out of here? - You ready? - Yeah, come on. Hey, wait for me. I never have a girl. Come on, why don't I ever have a girl? Jay? Why are you running away from me? I'm not running away from you, Cynthia. Look, I never made any commitment to you. You date whoever you want to date, and I'll date whoever I want to. Let's just be friends, OK? You're playing with fire, Jay. [music playing] I can't remember a hotter day. Me, either. You look as though you could use a break. Want to have an ice-cold drink with me? No, I'd better keep working and finish. Well, you've been working hard all day. I'd feel guilty if you don't let me give you a drink. OK, Mrs. Stevens. Call me Diane here. Well, come on. You'll have to come and get it. What will it be, tiger? Pop, wine, or champagne? Beer would be great, if you have it. You think you'll have time to do the inside today? Uh, I don't think so. Maybe some other time. Well, maybe you could do the one cabin only. I can't be late for the gas station. One cabin shouldn't take you long. Come on, I'll show you. See? It won't take you long to varnish in here. Um, well, to do a good job I need at least half a day, a day. Well, come on in. I'm not going to rape you. Oh, no, Mr. Stevens, I wasn't thinking that! These two chairs need vanishing, too. How about them? Yeah, yeah, I guess I have enough time to do these today. All right, come on. Let's get them up on deck. Why are you so afraid of me? I'm not. You don't like me, do you? Oh, no, I like you a lot. Prove it. How? Kiss me. What was that? Here. Come on. Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Stevens. I didn't mean to-- I know. I know. Oh, God, I-- I really gotta go. Don't talk. You'll spoil it. [mumbling] Mrs. Stevens. Mrs. Stevens. No one will ever know. I really shouldn't do this. Shh. What if Michael finds out? How's he going to find out? I'm not going to tell him. I can't believe this is happening. I like you so much. Shh. Have you ever done this before? I mean, with a student? No. Well, how come with me? Mmm. Because I like you. Is that the only reason? No. Because I can trust you. How come? [moaning] Oh, I've watched you long enough to know. [moaning] When are you getting your car back? I don't have the money to get it fixed, and the guy who hit me didn't have any insurance. I asked my boss for a loan. He says he'll think about it. How much do you need? Oh, about 300. I'll loan it to you. Oh, hey, I wasn't fishing. I know, I know. But I'll be glad to help you. Great! Hey, listen, I won't be able to pay you back for a while. It's an indefinite loan. What's the catch, Diane? I want you to do me a favor. So what did he say? I don't think you should use him. Why not? He wanted to make love to me. Son of a bitch. Can't blame him for trying. I think we'd better find somebody else. You know it's not that easy. We've got to be careful who we get involved with here. I think we can trust him. Really? I think we should wait. Michael, I want control of that money now. I'm going to inherit everything anyway. When? Look, I want that money as much as you, but we've got to be patient. For 10 years your mother and grandmother have been promising us that if we would cater to all of their selfish and senile demands, then you will inherit the money. Meanwhile, nothing. Not a penny. Only the use of this house, and now they want us out of here, too. If anything goes wrong, if they find out what we're up to, we'll lose it all. Michael, it's now or never. Remember when I was your student and you made love to me on the yacht? You promised to take me all over the world if I married you. They were just dreams, we never went anywhere. Your mother saw to that. I had to be available in case they needed us. Michael, I want us to have fun while I'm still young. I've got to get out of this town. I'm bored. Every day is the same. We won't be around much longer. Do what you want, Michael. But come summer, I'm leaving. [music playing] Look, Diane, I love you. And I'm not going to lose you. I promise. We'll do it, we'll get the money. [sighs] I'm sorry. [music playing] Ready? I can't do it. I thought about it all night. I'm counting on you, Jay. I'm sorry, Diane. Look, here's your money back. I know you're not doing it for the money. You're doing it for me. You're the only person I can trust. Hello, Jay. Hi, professor. He doesn't want to do it. What do you mean? Look, Jay, it's no big deal. You just go there and make some noises after they go to bed. Scare them, like you're a burglar. So we can talk him into moving out of the house and put them in a retirement home where they're much safer and better off. You know I wouldn't get you into any trouble. What if something happens? Nothing's going to happen. Please, Jay. Do it for me. All right. Great. Let's get going. [ominous music playing] [small dog barking] LETTIE: Did Michael say anything about dinner? LILLIAN: No, mother, they're not coming to dinner tonight. Michael has classes. Glasses? Michael needs glasses? No, Mother. Classes. He's teaching tonight. Leo! No, no. Um, now, Lillian, so Diane is coming without Michael tonight? No, Diane has classes, too. He should get rid of her. I don't know what he sees in her. She comes from a poor family. She's not [inaudible]. I told Michael not to marry her. She's a gold digger. She's not getting a penny of my money. She wants to put us in a retirement home so she can take everything over. Over my dead body. I'm writing Michael out of my will if he doesn't get rid of her. All right, now you see that fire escape there? There's a basement window down by the ground just on the other side of it. I've left it unlocked. You go through there. Now, remember, they go to bed at 9 o'clock. It's a snap, go to it. And whatever you do, make sure they don't see you. I will. Good luck. [sighs] DIANE: Just think what we'll do when we take over all of this. MICHAEL: We'll do whatever the hell we want to do. Just me and you. Come on. [thrilling music playing] [small dog barking] LILLIAN: Come on, Leo. Yes, you're getting home now. You're almost there. Watch it! Hello, George. Hello. Here, let me get that. Thank you. I want you to stay and have dinner with me tonight. I can't. You're not going to see Martin tonight? No. George, we've got to talk. It's getting to be out of control. Maybe tomorrow night. Get lost, George. [ominous music playing] What did you want to talk to George about? Our problem. We've got to solve it. Where's my hearing aid? Oh, Momma, you're wearing it. Come on, Leo. Jenny! What are you doing here? You're supposed to be working upstairs. I heard strange noises upstairs. You're not making any sense, but then you never do. And I heard strange noises coming from the cellar. Get rid of her. And if you ever dare to drink again while you're working for me, I'll fire you. George'll drive you to the bus. [whispering] Bitch. Maybe she's right. I'll go check. Get my dinner first. All right. Here. [small dog barking] Come on, Leo. Let's go. MAN (ON TV): God tells us to be giving, and God tells us to be generous. It is not our [inaudible] do with what we see. It is called duty. [car doors close] Bastard. [music playing] [loud metallic crashing] Shit. [metal crashing] [growling and barking] [growling and barking] Leo, what is it? [growling and barking] [ominous music playing] There's no one there. [growling and barking] [ominous music playing] [growling and barking] Leo, what's the matter with you? There's no one there. [dog barking] [growling] [dog barking] Shh! [dog barking] JAY: (WHISPERING) Motherfucker, get out of here. [growling and barking] [ominous music playing] MAN (ON TV): Whatever we all [inaudible] God, because God gave it to us. [dog barking] Come on out, you coward. Come on out or I'll blow your ass off! [dog barking] Shit! [gun fire] [dog barking] [gun fire] [dog barking] [gun fire] [thrilling music playing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] MAN (ON TV): The Lord tells us to be generous with those who need our generosity! Someone tried to break in. What? A burglar! There was a burglar in the house. Did you kill it? Oh, I wish I had. What? The son of a bitch ran away! Well, call Michael. I'm calling the police first. What in the hell are the police going to do? MAN (ON TV): [inaudible] you before me and empty your pocketbooks. [inaudible] It is our duty to share it with our fellow men-- [ominous music playing] --who are in need, and to give it to whomever God [inaudible].. [sighs] MAN (ON TV): Praying you'll [inaudible] to me, and I-- [rotary phone dialing] --will show you the way. There is a stairway I see now. And it's going-- [dog growling] MAN (ON TV): --and spoke to me-- [dog barking] -- and he said, Reverend, New York City. [dog barking] --hallelujah! [inaudible] [dog barking] --of money. [gun fires] Let God help us by-- [gun fires] -- how I've ever lived, oh, this long with not-- [body hitting floor] -- --this epitome of this moment, do you understand? Bring your money to me. [gun fires] I will show you the way to Heaven. [dog groaning] Oh, hallelujah. The Lord tells us to be generous. Lord, help us. Give me your money. Hallelujah, sisters! [gun fires] [loud explosion] [ominous music playing] [water rolling on tide] [boat horns in distance] [steps approaching] How come you're so early? What happened? Your mother tried to kill me. She shot at me with a rifle. What? Did she see your face? No. Are you sure? I said no! All right, I'd better call and find out. Are you OK? What happened? You were supposed to wait until they went to bed. And the dog started barking, so they found out I was in the cellar. Why didn't you tell me they had a gun in the house? I didn't expect her to be crazy enough to use it. She wasn't just trying to scare me away. She tried to kill me. Jay, please believe me. I had no idea anything like that would happen. There's no answer. It doesn't make any sense. Are you sure you're telling us everything? What do you mean? They always call me before they go anywhere. Let's not speculate or jump to any conclusions, all right? All right. Right. Let's go over there and find out what's going on. Come on. Come on. [crickets chirping] [ominous music playing] That's funny, the lights are all off. Their car's here. Maybe they went to bed early. Huh-uh. They always leave the outside lights on. [door opening] Mother? Mother? I'll check the bedrooms. Mother? You know you can trust me. MICHAEL: Mother? You're so nervous. Are you hiding anything from me? No. I told you everything exactly as it happened. They're not here. [footsteps receding] Where's the TV? It used to be right there. Jay, there was a TV set here. Where is it? How should I know? What, you think I stole it? Nobody said you stole it, but you were the last one here. I was never even in this room. I was only in the cellar. It didn't just vanish. Here's your TV set, Michael. All right, Jay, tell us the truth. I did. You're lying. You didn't harm them, did you? What are you talking about? I'm calling the police. [ominous music playing] DIANE: Michael, wait. They were murdered. You little bastard, you murdered them! You're crazy! Look, maybe you panicked and accidentally killed them. They were alive when I left here, I swear it! We want to help you. He wants to frame me! You were here. You were the last one to see them alive. You've got the motive, not me. Look, I'm calling the cops. Jay. don't. Let him! No one is going to the police. We all look guilty. We've got to stick together and find out what happened to them or we'll all be accused of murder. All right! I'm not going to say anything, but you keep your mouth shut. I won't say anything for now, but I'm going to find out who did this. Paranoia is a gross exaggeration of tendencies often found in normal people. Now, many people tend to become slightly suspicious or blame others for their failures. But in the paranoid personality, these tendencies become extreme. In their dealings with others, they become hostile, over aggressive, mistrustful. [backpack zippering] And they tend to go with the theory of getting the other guy before he gets you. [door closing] He should have gone before class. [laughter] [typewriting in background] Tell your husband, that asshole, get off my case or I'm going straight to the cops! Shh! Everybody on campus will hear you. I trusted you. I thought you liked me, but you were just using me, and I fell for it. I didn't use you. You're not telling me all you know. Why are you and your husband so afraid of going to the cops if you've got nothing to hide? Because they wouldn't believe us. Because you and Michael are going to inherit millions of dollars, right? But we didn't do it. We didn't want him to be killed. We only wanted them to be declared incompetent so that we could become executors to their estate. JAY: You're lying, Diane. You're the one who's not telling everything you know. Look, if you want to talk about this, here is not the place. Let's go somewhere else, OK? That won't work anymore, Diane. [girls voices] Jay, please don't do anything foolish until we have a chance to talk. [PHONE RINGING AND TYPEWRITING IN BACKGROUND] I wish I could believe you, but I can't. What the hell do you think you're doing? [door closes] I know what's going on between you and that witch. It's none of your business. Jay. Jay? Look, Jay, I'm warning you. You'll be sorry. See these? I'm giving these to her husband, and I'm going to show them to everybody on campus. Who took these? What difference does it make? Why are you doing this to me, Cynthia? I want you to stop seeing her. She has nothing to do with you and me. Then why don't you want to be with me anymore? Because you want to move in with me! And I told you before, I'm not ready for that with you with anybody. Look, Jay. I know you're broke, and I can help you. I have plenty of money! You want to help me, then leave me alone. Well, sorry, Jay. [ominous music playing] [car pulling up outside] [door bell ringing] Can I help you? Uh, I-- I came to see Professor Stevens. He's not here. I saw his car headed this way. Well, he's not here. Miss, I said there's no one inside. Oh, Professor. I didn't know you were here. Hi, Cynthia. Hi, Professor. Cynthia is one of my students. Would you like to come inside? I-- I guess maybe some other time. Oh, was there something you wanted to talk to me about? Yes, oh, yes. But it's, um, it's rather personal. Then come on in! No, uh, thank you, but maybe some other time. A beautiful girl, huh, Michael? I was just on my way out. Mother asked me to check the house. Have they gone somewhere? Yeah, they went to Hawaii. How come your mom didn't tell me? Ha! You know how [inaudible] she is, George. That's kind of strange. Your mom always tells me when they're going out of town. I saw her yesterday and she didn't say anything. Well, they left this morning, early. Oh. Well, then I better come over and feed the dog and see what's-- Nah, they took the dog with them. They'll be gone a couple of weeks. Then I better come over and water the house plants. You don't need to, George. Diane and I will do that. In fact, you don't have to come around until they get back. Hey, you've been with us a long time. You know how they are. I know. Your mom changed a lot after your dad passed away. A lot of things have happened in the last 20 years. Yeah, they don't want anybody to come around here unless they're here. Not even me. Look, George. Why don't you get your wife, jump in the camper and go away somewhere? Go fishing! Well, maybe I should. [car door opening] [car door closing] [phone ringing] Dr. Stevens speaking. It's me. DIANE (ON PHONE): Where are you? At Mother's. George suspects something's wrong. Do you think he knows? I'm not sure, but I got rid of him for now. It's the kid who's going to give us a problem unless we do something about him. Don't worry about that, I'll take care of him. Fine. [music playing] Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing? Trying to get my car fixed. Yeah, well, fix it on your own time. Don't fix it on mine. There aren't any customers. Customers, no customers, I'm paying you. Why don't you go stand by the pump and wait for a customer? Better still, why don't you clean the toilets? Do something. Oh, and another thing. You're going to have to work a couple extra hours tonight. Pedro has something to do. I can't. Can't? I don't understand the word can't. Well, I've got to go home and study for an exam. I don't give a damn about no exam. I got a station here to run. You've been acting mighty strange lately. Now, I need somebody around here that's going to work. Either you get your ass in here, or I'm going to fire you. Do you understand that? [car horn honking] Oh, howdy, Professor! Hi, Jimbo. I need someone to check the oil. Yeah, well, Jay here will help you, won't you, Jay? [sighs] DIANE: [clears throat] [car door closes] Come over to the boat, I have to talk to you. I have to work late tonight. I'll see you after work. I have to study. You don't need any oil. Look, Jay, it's not the way you think. I'll explain everything when I see you. [whistling] Here's the key. Make sure no one sees you when you get there. I have some errands to run. I'll see you in a couple of hours. [keys jangling] [music playing] Jay! Where the hell do you think you're going? Boy, you better get back here or you're fired! [music playing] Ugh. [music playing] [ominous music playing] Why are you here so early? I thought you had to work. [keys jangling] Why do you keep insisting we're involved? Who else would want them out of the way? What were you doing downstairs? Finding proof that Michael murdered them. What kind of proof? Look at this. Thousands of dollars of bills paid by the old ladies to a children's psychiatric hospital in Switzerland. Michael never told me he was in a psychiatric hospital when he was a child. That's not all. Look at this. So? It's blood, Diane. Yes, I remember. He went fishing. It's fish blood. And this is the fish eye, right? Don't be ridiculous, it could be glass from anything. From a television set, identical to the piece you found last night. Maybe it is. Only Michael was wearing boots when he was with us last night. So? So he was wearing these tennis shoes earlier when he murdered them. I don't know where you get all those crazy ideas. I should give you an A for creative storytelling. Are you going to give me an A for this, too? Everybody keeps a gun. It doesn't mean anything. Diane, why are you covering up for him? I'm not covering up for him or anyone. You don't think I did it, do you? You were with him during the time that the murders took place. No, I wasn't. After we left you, he took me back to the house. And then he said he was going back to campus to pick up some exam papers, and came back later to pick me up. Out of your mind if you think I could do such a thing. So then you think it's Michael? I don't know. Maybe. I wouldn't confront him if I were you. He's capable of being violent. Aren't you afraid of him? Sometimes. So what's keeping you with him? I've waited this long. Why should I walk away from all that money now? You think I'm crazy? I'm taking these and the gun with me. Jay, don't be foolish. If you go to the police, you'll be the prime suspect, not Michael. It's you who I'm concerned about. You were the last one in the house before they were murdered, not Michael. [music playing] I can't go on living in fear like this. I'm sorry I got you involved. I know you did it for me. I like you, Jay. I wish I could believe you. Trust me. [zipper noise] [gasping] [moaning] [music playing] Well, well. Mr. Jay Richard. How nice of you to finally show up. Where you been? Bad traffic? Bumper to bumper, huh? Cute. OK, let's cut the bullshit. Come on. Come on, I want to know. How was she? Oh, that's good, huh? Shut up, Bird. Hey, where's your beer? Ha! You want the can, too? Well, if there's anything in it. [ominous music playing] Where were you? You scared me. Answer me. I was with Jay, trying to stop him from going to the police. I told you I'd take care of him. Well, I just ran into him. Did you fuck him? You're drunk. So, did you keep him from going to the police? Or do you need to have more meetings with? He found some blood on your tennis shoes, and some glass. What the hell was he doing in the sleeping cabinet? I don't know, I wasn't on the yacht. How'd he get inside? He's spying on us. He also found your gun. It's in my purse. What else did he find? I don't know, why? Are you hiding anything from me? You know as much as I do. He said he has some other evidence against you. What evidence? I don't know, but I talked him out of going to the police for now. Where is he? On campus, I guess. Why? Son of a bitch. [music playing] Don't look. Michael is here. Shit. [sighs] I want to talk to you. Come on outside. You were with my wife this evening. Let me give you some advice. Stay away from her. [garbled voice on police radio] You can't go to the police, Jay. You've got no alibi. You know, I wouldn't take any chances if I were you, because your footprints, your fingerprints, they're all over the house. [crickets chirping] [ominous music playing] Ugh! Michael! [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] He shot at me. He tried to kill me. It can't be Michael. He got home early last night, right after he saw you on campus. Then who else? And the blood is gone. What do you mean? Somebody wiped the blood away. Whoever did the killing must have done it. But how could he have gotten into the house? The other person with a key to that house besides Michael and myself is the gardener. Why should he want to kill me? I don't even know him. There was a strange time between that gardener and Michael's family. He's some kind of a cousin to Michael's mother. He gives me the creeps. Then you think that Michael paid him to get rid of me? Maybe. [ominous music playing] [thunder rolling] We have to be careful about seeing each other, but I want to be with you. My roommate's going out tonight. Want to come over to my place? I'll call you. I warned him. Cynthia, it's over between you and Jay. Why do you keep running after him? Yeah, just because you've got it on with him doesn't mean you own him. Hey, I'm still available. Something's bugging him. Yeah, he's screwing his teacher. Hey, would you give the guy a break, OK? That bitch. I really got news for her. Guys, hate to break up the party, but it's starting to rain and I'm starving to death! Oh, well, I've got a doctor's appointment. Hey, I thought we were going to my place to study? Well, let's go then. No, no, no, we're going to the pub. I've got to eat a pizza. No, I'll catch you later. I got to fly. - Bye, Bird! [cawing like a bird] - Bye! Bye! [laughter] We don't have to study tonight after all. Why not? Because I have the test answers right here. - Let me see those! - Ah. ah, ah. Not so fast, not so fast. I've got to run an errand. I've got to go over to the Stevens', but I'll catch you later. Yeah, we'll see you at the pub. - OK! - She's nuts! Hey, I want a pizza with mustard and anchovy. Wait, wait! Wait for me, guys! No! [ominous music playing] Hello? Mrs. Stevens? Hello? Professor Stevens? [baby noises] Is anybody here? Hello? [music softening] [baby noises] Mrs. Stevens? [baby noises] [sudden loud, scary music] No, don't! [screaming] Ow! No, don't! [screaming] Ow! Don't! [screaming] [loud band music playing] All right! [cheering and applause] All right, we're going to take a short break now. So if any of you don't like our music, here's your chance to go hang yourself. She's a really mean lady. [laughter] Oh, gross! [interposing voices] Hey, um, faux pas [inaudible] by now. She promised that she'd come here after she saw the old lady. Nah, [inaudible]. Pizza, [inaudible] pizza, come on. [laughter] BIRD: You have more class than any guy-- I won. Class? What are you talking about? You know, I am pissed. I canceled a date for nothing. What date? [laughter] Hey, you know, I know-- I know Cynthia. And she's not going to show up. Oh, yeah? Yeah. [phone ringing] No answer. I'd try her again at the old lady's house. She still might be there squealing on Diane Stevens. But they're not listed. Let's go and see if she's still there. We need those tests. Good idea, or I'll flunk tomorrow. I'm going home. Yeah, me, too. Call me when you find her. Come on, man. No, I'll see you later. This bird's got to fly the coop. Hey, don't be an asshole. You need to take a break. Hey, forget it. Hey, come on. Oh. Please? Come on, you. [music playing on car radio] Woo! Wow. [inaudible] [radio cuts off] Her car's not here. - Let's get out. - Good idea. OK. [laughter] Oh, it's cold. Can you imagine having a place like this? - Oh, look at this. - It's incredible! Oh, it's big, it's big. People must have money. Big bucks. Why would a couple of little ladies live all alone-- boo-ha-ha-ha-- in a house like this? Who knows. They must be weird! [spooky singing] Hey, hey. I bet you Diane and Michael are going to throw one hell of a party the day those-- those two little old ladies kick the bucket. [laughter] [clears throat] [belching] Oh, gross! Swine. [laughter] Hey, how would you like living in a place like this all by yourself, skinny? Well, let me tell you. I'd be scared shitless, asshole. [laughter] Hey, come on you guys. Let's go back to my place and study. God, yeah. Guys, guys, guys. I've got to pee. Go pee! [laughter] [zipper noise] Good things come in small packages. [urination noise] [ominous music playing] Let's go back to my place. [ominous music playing] Hey, come on, you guys! Wait, wait, wait! [yelling] [laughter] [ominous music playing] [phone ringing] [music playing] Hello? DIANE (ON PHONE): Hello? Oh, hi, Diane. You coming over? DIANE (ON PHONE): No, Michael disappeared. What do you mean? He never came home tonight. I've been looking for him all evening. Did you check the campus? DIANE (ON PHONE): He wasn't there. Do you want me to meet you? I want to find him first. I'll call you later. OK. Bye. What's wrong with you? Nothing. You look like shit. Thank you. I'm glad you're not my doctor. I hope you're OK. I can't make the rent without you. Oh, it's so nice to know that somebody loves me. Thought you had a date tonight? Oh, I canceled it to go study at Janice's. So what happened? Cynthia never showed up. You see, she has got all the answers to the test, so they had to go look for her. Where did she go? Stevens house. Why? Look, Jay, I've got to tell you. You know, she is going to cause you and Diane all kinds of problems. Really, I mean, you've got to do something about her. [band music playing] [phone ringing] Campus Pub, Bubba speaking. Oh, yeah, just a second, Mrs. Stevens. He's right here. Dr. Stevens, it's for you. It's your wife! Come on, she's been calling all night! All right. Uh, Mrs. Stevens? I thought it was him. It-- it's not him. Are you sure? Yeah. If he comes in, I'll tell him to call you right away. OK, I will. Bye. [BAND MUSIC PLAYING QUIETLY IN BACKGROUND] [ominous music playing] Michael. Where were you all evening? You spying on me? Why didn't you take my call? I was busy. What was that all about? Nothing. Michael, damn you! What were you doing with him? He's suspecting us. He's asking me questions about my mother and my grandmother. What was that envelope you gave him? Some money I loaned him to get rid of him. He's becoming too nosy. Don't bullshit me. You and he are up to something. What? What am I to? Jay told me someone tried to kill him last night. And you believed him? Why should he lie to me? Too bad they missed. Whoever murdered your mother and grandmother wants Jay out of the way, too. You're insinuating I killed my mother. It could be you, or you put someone up to it. How do I know it's not you? You got rid of the old ladies, now you've got to get rid of the kid because he's the only witness, and I'm next! You've got it all planned, every move. That's absurd. Don't try to con me, Diane. I know you. You want that money. Not enough to commit murder. Then it has to be the kid! He has no motive! All right, all right, all right, you keep defending him, Diane. Just keep it up. You're fucking him, just stay with that. What do you expect me to do, Michael? I've always been faithful to you. You haven't made love to me in almost a year, ever since we started fighting with your mother. Don't, don't, just, you know, just don't run your act on me. You and I are through. You'll never see me again. [gentle music playing] You sound upset. DIANE (ON PHONE): I'm so furious I can't talk. Did you find Michael? DIANE (ON PHONE): We had a big fight. Where is he now? DIANE (ON PHONE): I don't know and I don't care. You still want me to come over? Yes. DIANE (ON PHONE): I'm on my way. Ciao. [laughter] I wouldn't see her if I were you. She needs me. Yeah? Well, her husband is bad news. They're breaking up. You know, your little hormones are going to get you into big trouble. It's way past hormones, Bird. I love her. OK, whatever you say. Look, I'm out of here. Oh, hey, Jay? Do you know where the Stevens mansion is? No, why? Well, you know how the guys were supposed to go there to find Cynthia? Well, they were supposed to call me whenever they got to Janice's. They haven't called me yet. They said it was somewhere near the marina. I don't know, Bird. Stay away from that house, OK? OK, OK. See you later, Romeo. Call me before you get back. You got it. [music playing] [knocking] You OK? I'm so glad you're here. Michael and I are through. I'm divorcing him. Are you sure that's what you really want? I wasn't honest with you or myself when I said I was going to stick around for the money. Michael wants to blame you for our breaking up, but that's not true. Our relationship was over long before I met you. His mother saw to that. Please hold me? [MUSIC - ARNETIA WALKER, "PLAYING WITH FIRE"] [moaning] [knocking] MICHAEL: Open this door or I'm going to break it down! [gasping] All right, open this door. I know you're in there. [knocking] Hey, open up! JAY: Who is it? Don't give me that, you little asshole. You know who it is. Hold on. Open this door or I'm going to break it down. [knocking] [gasping] Where is she? She's not here. Her car is parked outside. She just left. Oh, yeah? Hey, look, I told you. She's not here. I'll find her. [door closes] He'll be back. I don't want him to find me here. - Where would you go? - I don't know. The yacht. What if he goes there next? I don't care. I just don't want him to find me here. Come on, my car is in the back. I'll take you. OK. [sirens blaring in distance] Open this door! Are you OK? I'll see you in the morning, I'd better go. Please stay here with me tonight. I'm scared. Don't leave me alone. I won't. I need you. You're my friend. I love you. [ominous music playing] [sudden scary music playing] [yelling] Ugh! It's the same guy who tried to kill me last night! He's dead. Jay, come back! Let's call the police! We'll lose him! He's going to the Stevens property. Let's go. [ominous music playing] George's George's truck. He's not gardening this time of night. [crickets chirping] Where have you been? The doctor told me my disease is terminal, Mr. Johnson. Where's your mother and grandmother? What did you do to them? She didn't tell me I was dying because it's her fault, but, uh, I don't think you have to worry about her anymore. You killed them. You fool! Your mother was going to change your will and leave her money to you. Well, it's your fault, too. All these years, I finally talked your mom into bringing you back here from Switzerland so you could inherit the money instead of Michael and Diane! What would I do with the money? Have a nicer funeral? Ha! No. I think you're the one who cares about the money. Put it down, Martin. Hand it over. You don't want me. Nobody wants me. You want the money. Come on, Martin. Hand it to me, I said. You knew I was going to die, didn't you? Martin! He's got to be here somewhere. We've got to find him. [inaudible] go inside and call the police. OK. [no dial tone noise] That's strange. What? The phone's off the hook somewhere in the house. I wonder why. [no dial tone noise] Follow me. [ominous music playing] [gentle, spooky music] Lillian's room. Our son Martin, one year old. Martin's second birthday. Our son Martin in his new stroller, two years. In all these years, Michael thought he was an only child. Apparently he wasn't. So that was the secret that tied Lillian and her cousin George together. An illegitimate child. He's got to be about 20 by now. And if he's still alive, he'll inherit the entire fortune. Look, it's from a doctor at his school in Switzerland! Let me see. A medical report for Martin Stevens signed by a psychiatrist just four months ago. Huntington's chorea? What's that? I think it's some kind of hereditary disease. The patient could become violent, paranoia is common. He's-- [ominous music playing] --terminal. Come on out, Martin. [crazed laughter] [gentle, spooky music] [no dial tone noise] [crazed laughter] BABY VOICE: Come out and play with me. [crazed laughter] [baby noises] [dog whining] [dog growling] [dog barking] [dog growling and barking] [ominous music playing] Oh my god. [dog whining] [dog whining] [dog barking] [dog growling] [dog whining] [dog barking] [dog growling] [dog barking and whining] [door slamming shut] [flies buzzing] Come on, Martin! Let us out! [banging on door] Martin? Martin? Open the door! You want to catch me! Mother told me that if you and Michael found out about me, you'd want to get rid of me because you want the money. So I got rid of Michael. And now I'm going to get rid of you. Come on, Martin. Open up the door. Oh, oh, [baby voice] only-- oh, only if you promise to play with me. Ha, ha, ha! [baby noises] Only if you-- [baby noises] --play with me. [baby laughter] He's gone. [dog barking and growling] [ominous music playing] [dog growling and barking] JAY: The dog must have seen him. That's got to be why he's barking. [dog growling and barking] Maybe we should climb down to the balcony, see if we can corner him. Watch out! [gun fires] [pained baby noises] [dog barking] [choking] [gun fires] Oh my God. Bird! [dramatic music playing] Hey! Wow! Nice car! I'm leaving town for a while. Where to? On a vacation. Want to drive me to the airport in your car? No, my car needs fixing again. Well, I think your car drives fantastic. What's this? You're kidding me! No, I'm not kidding you. Diane! How will I ever spend all that money? I need you to help me after all. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be around to enjoy it. Come on, we're going to miss our plane. Where are we going? Hawaii. All right! See you, Jimbo! [dog barking] [inaudible] Jay! Where in the hell do you think you're going? Boy, you better get back here or you're fired! And I mean it this time!
