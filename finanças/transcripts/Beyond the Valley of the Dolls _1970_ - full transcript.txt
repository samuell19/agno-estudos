This batch has more snap. Run the rest at the same ASA. - (Woman) Long distance, Miss Lake. - (Susan) Hello? Who? Q-U-A-N-T. In London. Yeah, that's correct. As quickly as possible. Susan, dear, we must have a chat. The bodice is so wrong. - Doesn't she look like a cow? - The fact is, Cynthia is not a boy. Take off your bra, dear. That will flatten you some. Oh Gordon, have her put it back on. Betty, tell him it's impossible. Gordon, she looks exactly the same with or without the bra. - Porter, explain this contract to me. - (Porter) We can't get three years. They'll go two and a half. The editor tells me that is final. - People! - (Porter) I need some time with you. (Susan) Can we discuss it at dinner? That'll give you time to talk to Vogue. - Anything we can do for you? - That's OK... - ...I can come back. - Out with it. We're not that frantic. - I'm your niece. - You're Catherine's daughter? My name's Kelly Mac Namara. Susan! Susan! I am simply in a rage! (Susan) How did your mother learn about Aunt Claire? The Worcester paper is where she heard about Aunt Claire's death and about... ...you and Baxter Wolfe and the inheritance. - What inheritance was that? - Mine. I was last in line after my sister. Your mother disappeared. We were never really close. I was 14 years younger. Now that you've come along, I think that part of it should be yours. Susan. Susan, you know there was no provision in the will. - Thousand Island? - No, thank you. You're a lawyer. You should know that wills are just paper. I'm a lawyer, yes. And any changes Aunt Claire would or might have made... - ...have no validity in law. - Porter, of course I know that. Kelly, there was nearly a million dollars. I know this isn't the time or place... ...but since Porter's made such a point of it, I can't see why... ...say, a third of it shouldn't be yours. - A third of a million dollars? - The two of us are the only survivors. I don't see why you should have to pay for the sins of your mother. Sins that seem to me that were really committed by the rest of the family. - That's a big idea to get used to. - I'll have Porter draw up the papers. I have a marvellous idea. Ronnie Barzell's throwing a party tonight. Ronnie Barzell? You mean Z-Man Barzell? The one, the only, the original. Susan, I've got friends in a rock group. It would mean so much for them to meet Z-Man. Can I invite them? - Don't tell me you're a groupie. - The other way. It's my group. Now, let me be sure I fully understand this. You are a rock'n'roll singer? - Why? Is that a no-no? - My dear young lady.... Porter, you have an unending capacity for counterfeit astonishment. Of course you can invite your friends. There's a phone in the living room. I think that Ronnie's address is in my book under the B's. Great! I'm not dressed for a party, though. We're about the same size, and I got loads of things in my closet. Call your friends and slip into anything you like. OK? Oh, groovy! Thanks. Susan, have you taken leave of your senses? Some anonymous rock'n'roll singer drops in here out of the clear blue sky... ...and you fall for a lie. You won't believe this, but we've been invited to a party at Z-Man Barzell's. - Is this for real? - Get Casey and Pet, and meet me there. This creature marches in without a cent to her name and a dubious pedigree... ...and without a moment's thought... ...you recklessly dispose of a third of your money. - Porter, let me handle this. - The party starts when you get there. - Susan, please. - We're late already. - They banned my last film in Cincinnati. - Groovy town. When I'm with you, pussycat, who needs grass? You'd have to see it to believe it. Of course, I nearly choked. - And then this bitch took a drink... - He's bothered every woman at the bar. Do you know what happened after he drank a Fresca? - He snowed in his pants. - You know what he uses for deodorant? - Raid. - Cool, man. My old man really blew his mind. He said he'd kill me if he found any more grass. - Escape, man. - All right! - And you're a moonchild. - And you're a bitch. - I think it's better after the change. - I'm with you. I was ready to roll over and fall asleep. Then Tony said, "Come over to my pad. - I've got a wading pool of mayonnaise!" - Mayonnaise? I found the European women far more receptive and less hung-up. - She went after me like a barracuda. - I warned you, you old fruit. - (Woman) Classics Benjamin. - Bad trip. - It wasn't long, but four inches thick. - Ever been whipped with a wand... - ...until the blood came? - Cool it! You'll rupture your tongue. Feel it, my pretty? The night is filled with magic. - Mark my words, dove, tonight is special. - I was so anxious, I stepped on her face. Susan, Porter, how are you? Ronnie, see who's here. - I'll say it. Haven't I seen you before? - You saw her at my studio this afternoon. - Ronnie, this is my niece, Kelly. - Every inch as ugly as you are, Susan. Must run in the family. I'd like you to meet Vanessa, my escort and bodyguard. - Pleasure. - Come on, babe. I'll show you the dump. Come with me, I want to show you the most divine clairvoyant. ♪ ...that the people all called L.A. ♪ Went to school in the great big city... - What can I get you, juice or grass? - Just a vodka and tonic, please. Look there. The infamous Ashley St. Ives... ...famous for her portrayals in prettily pornographic pictures. See how she gives her body to the ritual? Delicious. Observe in yon quiet corner, an island of tranquility in this sea of revelry. The languid Roxanne finds beauty, that delicate pinch of feminine spice... ...with which she so often flavours her interludes. Look there. Lance Rocke. Greek god and part-time actor. See how well he performs? His is a special talent. The golden hair, the bedroom eyes, the firm young body. These are the tools with which he plies his trade. All are available for a price. Beware, fair maiden, of Emerson Thorne. Behind that friendly mask... ...lies fermenting the unholy seed of a lawyer. See there, behind the bar, the man with the benign Germanic countenance? Could that be another face of Martin Bormann? I've been to parties where they danced to records by The Strawberry Alarm Clock. But this is the first time The Strawberry Alarm Clock's ever been to the party. What are you shelling out? I hear the minimum is four thou. - I get them for free. They're mine. - Wow. Really? Here, have some grass. Aunt Susan won't see you. No, thanks, man. In a scene like this, you get a contact high! This is my happening and it freaks me out! It's a stone gas, man. Pray, we must make haste. My time is not my own. Before the clock strikes 12. I must be back at Forest Lawn. Come, I know of a cosy little dungeon... ...where just the two of us can curl up with the chains and a spider. Delighted to see my hostages in such happy dalliance. Pray, let them joust in peace. You're not helping the situation any, I must say. Out. Out. Count Dracula relishes an audience, only one at a time. - Have fun. - What is this, a studio tour? - This looks like the... - Master's bedroom. (Horns blowing) Can you dig it? Follow me, my dear. Let me show you one of my preoccupations. And this is the master's bath. (Gasps) (Ronnie) Come on. - Sorry to disturb you. - (Man) It's cool, baby. Hey, I've heard about trees growing in Brooklyn, but ferns in the biffy? - Class. - The idea came to me in a vision. - Every morning, I luxuriate in my bath. - I dig, man. You're on an ego trip. But what about the ferns? Let's call them tropical varieties.

Better than the zoo. Putting people down for having a good time? On the contrary, my dear. But this is hardly my idea of a civilised good time. Casey Anderson, huh? No relation to Senator Casey Anderson? He's my father. I'll bet he's highly amused that his daughter's a hippie? - I'm in a rock group. - And that's your uniform? And that's yours? At least it's not a uniform worn by freaks. So the senator's daughter is a rock'n'roll singer, huh? Say, do you and your friends shack up in a minibus, or aren't things that cosy? ♪ I'm comin' home ♪ (Roxanne) I couldn't help but notice your little run-in with Porter Hall. - Men. - Ninety-nine percent. Casey, I'd like to design something for you. Why don't you stop by my studio sometime? It's a trip to design for a good figure once in a while. Anyway, you could imagine how this woman feels... ...when she finds out that her 17-year-old son... ...is making it with one of her best friends. Now, you have to remember that she... ...has a young lover of her own. So it makes her take a long look at her whole scheme. That's why in my new film, they drag in this whole thing... ...about the lack of communication between parents and kids. Well, now, Harris, we meet again. "Come into my den," said the spider, et cetera. - I was looking for somebody. - Anybody I know? Where do you get this "anybody I know" business? From one of those pornographic movies you star in? You mean my controversial box-office blockbusters? Ashley St. Ives. I saw one of your movies once. I think it was the one about the teenage incest triangle. You'll have to help me on the research for the next one. - So you're an ear freak? - Name some more. All right, then. How about a toe freak? I need it. I want it. A beautiful woman kissing me between the toes. People who wear sandals must not get very many volunteers. - I could change. - Into something more titillating? That sounds vaguely obscene. You're a groovy boy. I'd like to strap you on sometime. And if there's anything I can't stand, it's vagueness. Harris. A deathly dry gin martini. - But I thought we had another case. - Excuse me, have you seen Kelly? No, the last time I saw her she was wandering around with Z-Man. - They can be anywhere. - Thanks. Get yourself in gear, baby. These people are dying of thirst. Look, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll check. OK? - But, Lance, I gave you $1200 last week. - I want $12,000, baby. (Crowd clapping) - I'm sorry. - Perfect timing. I was looking for the john. Z-Man Barzell is a very rich cat, but he doesn't have a john in the kitchen. - Maybe I was looking for a sandwich. - This ain't no welfare line. Then what are you standing in it for? - Getting my thing together. - You putting me on? Unmasked again. He poses as a busboy... ...but in real life, he's Emerson Thorne... ...ambitious young law student... ...who studies by day and waits by night. I was going to say something smart-ass, but, all of a sudden, you know what? No. What? Suddenly, I knew you weren't putting me on... ...that you were Emerson Thorne, ambitious young law student... ...and all that crap. What about that kiss and all that crap? There's more where that came from, Emerson Thorne. You're into a heavy scene. Don't sweat it. It can be a drag. - Am I interrupting something? - (Kelly) Harris! Only a little make-out session between Count Dracula... - ...and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. - Hey, man. Ronnie Barzell, I'd like you to meet Harris Allsworth, my.... - My manager. - Manager, eh? Any friend of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is a friend of mine. - Manager? - The Kelly Affair. The Kelly Affair? You mean, you're the Kelly? Little did I suspect I was in the presence. Still, that name won't do, you know. It's awfully 1950s. - Might as well call them The Haircuts. - Kelly, I'm ready to leave. Leave? No. You have not yet graced our gathering with a song. Come, my dove, I must present you to the faithful. Now! Ladies and gentlemen, an announcement if you please. There is a new rock group in the house. Their name, The Kelly Affair. Well, even their best friends don't like their name. Still, as the teen tycoon of rock, I'd like to hear them and I'm sure you would too. The Kelly Affair.

The cat swore up and down it was Acapulco Gold. - If we're lucky, maybe it's at least pot. - Or we'll get an oregano high. - Weren't you with Emerson all afternoon? - I was. - I thought he was at the law library. - He was. So, like, when did you score, man? Well, Emerson slipped me a graduate-student pass. I went back in the stacks to do some research in the rare book collection. - And who do I run into but my score? - Cool, man. That's getting it together. - Yeah. See you later, Kel. - OK. - Hi, babe. Coming to the party tonight? - What party? Everyone's splitting for Z-Man's. - Everybody? - You bugged, man? - Yeah. - What's the matter, baby? - Things happened tonight. - Sure. - So? - So where do I fit in, Kelly? - I don't dig. - There once was a time... ...maybe you can remember, when I was your manager... ...not the next thing to a goddamn groupie. Come along to Z-Man's. Do you good. Move it out, Kelly. - Be right there. - (Ronnie) I will meet you out by the car. I gotta split, man. - Say, Miss Mac Namara? - Uh-huh? You were great.

Well, at least let me call you a cab. What do you say, everybody? Let's do it. (Car starts) - Going my way? - I'm skipping the party. I'm going home. I'm skipping the party too. Why don't you climb in, unless you have a ride? - Don't put yourself out. I can hitch. - We're going the same way. Come on. Get in. Turn left at the next street. Mine's the one on the right with the bright lights. - So? - Thanks a lot, Ashley. Don't I even deserve a good night kiss?

A Rolls! A Rolls! (Lance) You're beautiful, Kelly. Kel, who's that Susan Lake broad? What's her story? - Susan Lake, my long-lost aunt. - Aunt Susan? That's far out. She's a fine-looking lady. Nice and firm. Round and beautiful. Well, pneumatic. - Aunt Susan? - Yeah, Aunt Susan. - She'd flip out to hear you say that. - I doubt it. - Lance? - Yeah? - I'm thinking of cutting my hair. - Well, don't. Why not? I wanna love you for more than money. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean, the millions. - The Lake millions. - You know a lot about me, don't you? - There's no secrets at Z-Man's. - I gently suggested to Aunt Susan... - ...that the millions could go screw. - You what? - You heard me. - Wow, baby, that was really dumb. And how come you're only getting a third? You ought to be getting half, and you know it. - Why should I get anything at all? - You earned it. Getting shafted all your life while all those relatives lived it up in Worcester. - You know a lot about my family. - Like I say... ...there aren't many secrets around here. Kelly. Now listen, Kelly. I'm gonna give you some free advice. baby, and you'd better take it. The noble Porter Hall is trying to get his lunch hooks on that dough. He's screwing you, baby, not Susan Lake. That girl Kelly Mac Namara is a tramp. She was living in a single room with three other individuals. One of them was a male. And the other two? Well, the other two were females. God only knows what they were up to in there. And furthermore, I wouldn't be surprised to learn... ...that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes. - Reefers. - I'm Kelly Mac Namara, Ms. Lake's niece. - Hi, I'm glad to know you. - Thanks. She in? Can I see her? I'll see. - Miss Lake, Miss Mac Namara. - Besides, if Kelly does turn on... - Send her in. - You may go in now, Miss Mac Namara. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. Now you try to contain yourself, Porter. - I hope I'm not interrupting anything. - Come in, Kelly. Porter's all steamed up. - Too much partying. - (Porter) You listen to me, hippie. I don't know who you are or where you came from... ...but if you don't withdraw your morbid interest in Miss Lake's affairs... - ...I shall be forced to take legal action. - Man, I doubt if you'd recognise a hippie. I'm a capitalist, baby. I work for my living, not suck off somebody else. Not a penny, Miss Mac Namara. Not a single penny. I promise you that. - You're making a fool of yourself. - A tramp with the morals of an alley cat. - Up yours, ratso! - Not a single penny. It's not her money. Even if she is who she claims to be, her behaviour's disgusting. - I'll take half a million dollars, man! - What was that? You heard me. Half a million dollars and not a penny less. How can you be so blind, Susan? I met her type before. The little innocent face and smile. The little, sweet virgin-whore. Porter, why are you acting like this? She's only a child! It's got to be, Susan. It's gotta be half. Half a million dollars. Mom never wanted it, but she should have had it. That's the way it's gotta be. Precedent for a defendant waiving jury trial for a private hearing... - ...in a case involving national security? - Um... Talbott v. United States. Supreme Court decision, 1917. Amended 1941, in the case of the government. Plaintiff v. Consolidated Industries and defendant Robert F. Zanka. Prejudice of jury alleged in case involving alien national...? Enough. Tomorrow I'll study. - Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. - You sound like Z-Man. And Z-Man sounds like Will Shakespeare. Right now, I feel like making love. She loves me, she loves me not.

(Phone ringing) - (Lance) See what the ace has got to say. - (Porter) We were cut off. I'm terribly sorry about that scene in Susan's office yesterday. Certainly, I never remotely intended to give the impression... ...I must have left. There are so many things I feel we have in common... ...that I'd appreciate it very much if we could have a drink... ...perhaps sometime this afternoon and discuss them. Have the drink.

And at what time? - 3:00, I guess. Tell him 3. - I'll be there about 3. See you then. Bye. You did good, beautiful. You know the mother's up to something. Here's your chance to really shaft him. Think so? I know so. I'll be out of here by 3, in case you need the place. Why do I do everything you tell me? I don't know. Why do you? I can't help myself. You've made me into a whore. And you dig it, you little freak. Kelly, I'm so pleased that you agreed to meet me. That scene yesterday? I've already told you how perfectly dreadful I feel about it. I made certain allegations that I can only deeply apologise for. - ID? - I'm having a coffee. A very dry vodka martini for me. Make it a double, please. Of course we've had our misunderstandings, but who hasn't? I believe they call it the generation gap. In my day, they called it something else. I can remember when my father raised the dickens over me. I was a devil then. Came home in a pinch-back suit. He thought I'd gone the way of Oscar Wilde.

Together, we share the wonder of human existence. And let there be no doubt that all of us are brothers. There can be no beginning or ending that does not in some way touch another. For our actions affect the lives and destinies of the many. Z-Man: He forgot that life has many levels... ...and by choosing to live on only one, lost sight of reality. Ashley: Men were toys for her amusement. Her total disregard for their feelings made love a stranger to her. Lance Rocke: He never gave of himself. Those who only take must be prepared to pay the highest price of all. Porter Hall used his profession to mask selfish interests... ...to betray the trust that should have been sacred. Susan Lake: Perhaps too pure. Excessive goodness can often blind us... ...to the human failings of those less perfect. Emerson found that something as precious as love... ...brings with it a demand for greater understanding. Casey and Roxanne: Light and shadow. Theirs was not an evil relationship. But evil did come because of it. Otto: An end to Martin Bormann? Harris: He forgot that yesterday is only for remembering. Those who choose to live there lose sight of tomorrow. Pet's mistake: A fleeting thing, born of emotion... yet it almost ruined the lives of two others Randy's body: A cage for an animal. It lifted him to the top of his field... ...but in the end, the beast almost killed him. And Kelly? Her selfish involvement... ...so ready to turn her back on friendship. The road back is painful. By her pain, she will never again forget. You must each decide what your life will be. You must always know that a hand extended to your fellow man... ...is a gesture of love.
