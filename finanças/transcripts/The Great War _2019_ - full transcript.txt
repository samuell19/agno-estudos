Body of Christ. In the name of the Father, and of the son and of the Holy Spirit. - Make sure he gets there. - Yes, Sir. - You stay here with me. - Yes, Sir. Uh, Captain Roberts, we've been looking for you, Corporal, can you run ahead and get Sergeant Richardson for me, please. Yes, Sir. Well, you got any good news for me? I'm afraid not, you are headed into the thick of it. - All right what are the numbers? - Forty or 50 fighters. What kind of support do they have? There's three machine guns interspaced with interlocking fields of fire, mortars in the middle for support. All right, sounds like we got some trouble. But if you hit the trenches with grenades, keep on going down the line, the Germans are spread thin. It'll confuse them. Ammo, check for the platoon, make sure everyone has enough. Yes, Sir. Now wait a minute... ...are you sending the 365th to be our flank? - The buffalo soldiers? - Yeah, with them on the left, we'll press through German lines and secure the objective. Wait, wait, wait, do they have combat training? Does that matter? Is this a problem? Well, if they don't have combat training, yeah, Allen, I mean, they're-- they're green. Look, I know that we don't share the same belief on the black soldiers, but these boys can fight. They're ready. All right. - You okay? - Yeah. Just a little shaky. - What am I about to drink? - That's brandy my friend. You and your goddamn brandy. Oh, and you were not lying. Hey, happy hunting. You okay, Will? Yeah. A little shaky. It'll pass. The men are ready. Shall we? Yeah. Yeah, let's get it over with. Keep your heads down, lads. The steel rain will soon pass. Don't give the Hun bastards an easy one. This is it. The time you've trained for. The moment we prepared for. You are all ready! It's okay. Let it out, let it out. Let it out. Okay. Good. ¶ When Johnny comes Marching home again ¶ ¶ Hurrah, Hurrah ¶ ¶ We will give him A hearty welcome then ¶ ¶ Hurrah, Hurrah ¶ ¶ The men will cheer And the boys will shout ¶ ¶ The ladies They will all turn out ¶ ¶ And we'll all feel gay ¶ ¶ When Johnny comes Marching home ¶ Sir. - Fix bayonets. - Fix bayonets! Fix bayonets! This is it, lads. I'll see you on the other side. Good luck, Sir. Sir! - Are you hit, Sir. - No, no, no, I can't do this. - What? - I can't do it! - No! - I can't do it! - No, no! No! - I can't-- Let me go! I can't-- Snap out of it! Will! Will, over here. Keep moving! You fellas stay on my ass and don't stop. Keep moving forward! My leg! - Someone help. - No, you stay there. - Who's your platoon leader? - You are now, Sir. Oh, Lord I'm alive. Thank you, Jesus. - Thank you, Jesus. - Good to see you, Sergeant. - Just out for a stroll. - Do you know where we are? Not any place I want to stay very long. They're tearing us to shreds. So I guess it will have to be a hell of a plan. Did you see anyone else? Everyone else is pinned down or dead. Got a field radio? We got a field radio. Didn't make it. Get me a runner. Runner! Runner! Get down, get down. Listen, we've reached the other side. Guns are not destroyed. Objective in question. Stay low. Go. - Shit! I need another runner. - No. No, no. Sir, it's getting pretty hot here. - Okay. - They have our position, Sir. - We need to move. - Okay. Uh-- All right. Get grenades. Get your grenades out. - Grenades! - Grenades! Wait for a barrel change, toss grenades and then go. On my signal. Now! Move! Go, go, go! You good? Yeah. But man, my feet are killing me, though. - Quit talking. - Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Where you been? This bitch weighs a ton. Let's go, guys. Come on. Come on. Through the back. We got a machine gun and support crews. We gotta take out those guns. Kirby, Pincelli, grenades. Quinn, Cardinni... you follow me after the blast. We'll leapfrog to the end of the trench. Where do you want me, Sir? - Just watching our backs. - Right. Kirby, Pinchelli. You're up. Watch it. Watch it. Go! Here they come! Hey, Mick, you want in on this? - I don't strip the dead. - All fools the Irish. Just leave me alone. You all right, O'Malley? Holy shit! Card, get a load of that. How come you're always getting the good stuff? Just lucky, I guess. For Christ sake, who did he kill for that? Hey, nothing's sacred anymore. Snap out of it! Sir? Trench is secure, Sir. Thank you, Corporal. Um... you send a runner? Yes, Sir. Okay. Any other news? The Huns are licked. Regiment's pouring in from all over. - We own this ground. - Thank you, Corporal. Thank you. There's something else? Uh... ...yes. I mean, no, Sir. - It's been a long day - Okay. Corporal, why don't see if we can find some real food. - Sir. - Sergeant Corporal. Colonel, there's something I think you should know about. What is it? We've broken through the German lines at Argonne. - Has this been confirmed? - Yes, twice. "D company of the 365th regiment has pushed six miles east of the last known German front line. Last reported 0700 have not had further contact." What is this? The 365th is a colored unit. Reports assume the company has been cut off or lost. - They're trapped? - Seems like it, Sir. Sir, they are on the flanks of the 77th liberty division. Widdle C's division? Yes, Sir. - Has this hit the papers? - Not yet, Sir. I've got to tell the General. Come with me. Has there been any contact? None so far, Sir. We wanted to bring it to you right away. My second army has been making major advances in the Argonne and these boys have done it. Permission to speak freely, Sir. Please speak freely, Colonel. When the cease fire commences... the last German position held by the allies will become the new French occupied country. What are you asking of me? Well... it's kind of complicated, Sir. You see on the one hand those boys could be heroes. Now, would sure boost morale back home with the coloreds, but on the other... Germans are going to want that hill back. Yes, they will, Sir. That could be a publicity nightmare... if they all get killed. Any update on their status? Do we know if they're alive or dead? None so far, Sir. Hmm. I'd like to read you something. "Negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us if we will not do anything for them? If they stake their life for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive... even the promise of freedom. And the promise, being made, is a promise that must be kept. One day peace will come. And then there will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation. While, I fear, there may be some white men... unable to forget... that with malignant heart and deceitful speech... they strove to hinder it. Yours very truly, A. Lincoln." Alive or dead these boys have... they've done a lot in this war. What we're going to do is we're going to find them... and we're going to get them down off that hill. Well, is that it? Is that all they could muster? They are off time, man. And the target. They have nothing to add to it. I want results, not excuses. If you don't have them boys from the 369th get that artillery to the front. There will be hell to pay! Okay we have had too many casualties, now make it happen. That's an order! Artillery was supposed to get us a walking path into this sector, but they haven't been able to hit a thing. Can you believe that? They haven't hit a target in this goddamn war. How did you manage? Well, we, uh, we cleared out sector three here, Sir. Actually that's where we ran into those colored soldiers from the 365th, that platoon, nobody seems to know where those guys are. Also, um, the-- the boys from the 40th, they... they don't have enough training, Sir. Some of them didn't even have rifles. Resistance? Yeah, there are machine guns that we had to get by. I mean, they were spread out evenly throughout and we had to dig in and work the trenches one by one. I used the whole goddamn platoon. Casualties? Casualties, yeah. Yes, Sir. It was a tough assignment, Will. Yes. It was, Sir. It's good to be back. Will, I have another assignment for you. That platoon from the coloreds is cut off behind enemy lines. Division wants a search party to head out, find them, and bring them back. Uh, I don't know, Sir. Some of my men don't get along well with the coloreds. Well, that's straight from the top. Yes, Sir. Give me that other map. They want us to do what? You and I'll take a patrol over to section 32. A patrol? Like four or five men? Yeah there's a platoon from the 365th that needs a little help getting back to friendly lines. - Those colored boys again? - Yeah. This isn't going to be easy, Sir. The Germans are still out there. So it seems, Thomas. They do know that the war is almost over, right? Yeah. Last time I checked. Sir, you know how most of the men feel about the colored troops. It's Captain Roberts men. And Captain Roberts is dead. All right. Who are we taking? Kirby, Pincelli, O'Malley, Quinn and Cardinni, okay? - The regulars then? - I guess so. Have them squared away and ready to go in 30. Where are you going? - I'm going to find our runner. - A runner? Yes, Sir. - Can I help you, Captain? - I'm looking for a Private Cain. Jenkins, get your lazy ass up. Go and see if you can find Cain. Yes, Sir. I don't know what good he'll do you. Nigger don't know a goddamn thing. I beg your pardon, Captain. Are you looking for that Roberts platoon? No shit. I think they should just let them French bastards figure those niggers out. I, uh, I wouldn't know, Captain. You never had a nigger under your command? No. Troublesome bunch, them niggers they ain't as smart as you and me. Again, I wouldn't know. Uncle Sam dresses 'em up, gives them a uniform. Calls them soldiers. It's all just a damn show. Let me give you some advice, Captain. Don't find them niggers. They deserve what's coming to 'em. You don't want this. You get stuck commanding these dumb apes, that's my burden. Well, are you just going to stand there boy or what? Private John A. Cain, reporting as ordered, Sir. See? A nigger can have some manners... right? You have been reassigned to this Captain. Understand? I understand, Sir. You talking back to me boy? Private, uh, gear and rifle? - No, Sir. - We'll get you some. Captain, thank you. I'll take it from here. Rivers... remember what I said. You don't want to end up like me. Captain. Just grab a rifle and any gear you need right here. Thank you. Now when you, uh, left your platoon who was, uh, commanding officer? Sergeant Perry, Sir. I'm not sure about him now. I guess he still is, old man won't die. Just grab as much ammo as you can. Thank you, Sir. For what? For sticking up for me back there. Let's get something straight. We're not friends. I have orders to help find your platoon. That's all there is between us, do you understand that? Yes, Sir. Why is he out front? What's the matter? I don't like it. Ol' Rivers must trust him or he wouldn't be here. Yeah. No one asked for your advice, bumpkin. Rescue some dumb louts that got lost behind enemy lines. Great way to end the war. Yeah. If you ask me, this whole mission is nuts. Yeah. I didn't join the army to go on some spook rescue mission. You shouldn't call them that. Why? That is what they are. Oh, you think they like being called that? No, Sir. No. They're just like you and me. They ain't like me. - Nobody's like you. - Yeah, coming from the hay seed, that don't mean much. - Yeah. Where are you from again? - Missoula. What did you call me? Missoula, Montana. The hell you guys do in Missoula Montana? I don't know. This mostly. Sounds great 'cause I ain't never going to visit. It's actually a pretty nice place, you know, the-- Oh, shut it, will you? I think you guys would really like it. No. No one cares 'cause there ain't nothing - like 41st Street back home. - That's right. You're awfully quiet over there, Mick? Well, I'm carrying this heavy bastard and I'm tired of your shit. Yeah. Well, you ain't much better than me. The lot of you, a bunch of smoked Irish if you ask me. - I could go for a smoke. - Yeah. And a pint. - Yeah. Me too. - Me too. Have you guys noticed anything weird about Captain? What? I don't know he just seems off. Man, the Captain's just fine. Yeah. Pincelli is probably getting your guard down - to steal all your stuff. - Cool it, Card. - No one is touching me. - Cut it out, will ya? Sergeant, do you want me to shut the men up, Sir? No, no. They're okay. How is everything going up here, Captain? Fine as can be. How is he doing? Well, if he was lost we wouldn't know it. He does know where he's going, though? No. We're heading to their last known location. Do you think those men are still out there? They're US soldiers. Yeah. But alive? I don't know. It's hard to say. Well, the war could be over before we find them. Yeah, it could be. But when have we ever been that lucky? First time for everything, Sir. Thomas? - Sergeant? - Yes, Sir. - What is this? - Pain station, Sir. Captain. - Captain. - Nurse, ...what's going on here? The Red Cross Field Hospital. - You're a long way from home? - Miss Clairborne. Miss Clairborne, uh, who are all these people? We've been collecting them from all over. Gassed. We do what we can for them here and then we send them off for treatment. Am I looking at Germans? Yes. Them too. Every man is equal in the eyes of the Red Cross. You're not safe here, miss. Is anyone safe anywhere in this war? Well, no. I'm just saying that-- - You're-- That I'm a woman? - No, It's not that-- Look, Captain, I appreciate your concern, but this is what I signed up for. This is my war. - Okay. - Are you here to help? Uh, we would love to but, uh, we're actually trying to make contact with a platoon that was lost behind enemy lines. Negros? Yeah. Do you know where they are? We had a few come in this morning. Uh, hold on, uh, Private Cain? Uh, can you take us to them right away? - Yes. - Uh, follow me. - They're right over here. - Joseph? John? I said I'd come back, didn't I? You going to be all right? - Ma'am? - For now, yes. What about the others? Ask about the others? Hey, Joseph, I brought some help. Where's the rest of the platoon? They hit us hard, John, but we held. We did hold. Where are the others? They're held up on the hill. All dug in. How far? - I don't know. - Joseph... think. It's important. It's a large hill. We could see it for a distance, five or six miles. That's good. Good job. - John? - Yeah? Is it true? Is the war almost over? You bet it is. We've almost got those Huns licked. I want to see my family. You'll see 'em. You'll see 'em soon. Mary, more are coming in. Gas. Go. We're going to get really busy and you two can't be here. Uh, nurse. - Thank you. - Mary? My name is Mary. Be safe. Private. - Be safe. - Thanks, brother. Oh, you want another? Move the cards, gentlemen. Anything new? Move the friggin cards. Let's go. All right, listen. The Germans know that the war is basically over. Any ground that's kept by the allies is going to be part of the French countryside. French would love to hear that. Joseph said they were dug in on hill, can see the countryside for miles. Now, take a look. We're here and Hill 473 is on the Market River just northwest of here. Now that's the tallest hill in the sector. They could be there. Do we even know if they're still alive? Hey. If Joseph said they're there, - then they're there. - Yeah. Who's asking you? - Shut it. - Listen, dead or alive, we are following these orders. Do you understand? All right? Are there any questions? I'm asking you a question. Are there any questions? - No, Sir. - Okay form up. - Sergeant on me - Yes, Sir. Gear up, boys. Still trying to find some lost nigs. What kind of world is this? We should let the Germans finish them-- Hey, hey, hey-- - Save it! Save it. - Calm down. What are you on his side? - What are you on his side? - Hey, come on, let him go. Cardinni, Cool off. What are you two crying about? Pack up. Shut your mouth. What do you think? Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to tell. Maybe they got something to eat. Maybe nobody's home. Mick, I can't see a damn thing. It looks empty to me. That doesn't mean it is. All right, tactical movement. Two on two off. Who's up? Who's up? I'll go. I'll go. All right on my mark. - That's where I'd be. - Get that Chauchat on them. Quinn, Pincelli, you're up. Quinn, Pincelli, Go. You're up. Go, go, go. Go! I'm out. Reloading. That MG is tearing us up. They have my position. Get down. Go, go, go, go! You're up! Go! You said you'd never do that again. I lied. Huns! Jam! This is a tight spot, Will. You got anymore tricks up your sleeve? Nope. That's it. All right, we're up. Go, go. What the hell was that? Clear! - Clear. - Sir? You boys okay? Hell of a firefight. Yeah, Lieutenant. What outfit you with? General Russel Simmons, Sir. Thirty-third. Captain Will Rivers, 432nd. Germans pushed right up our center. Cut us in two. Couldn't find these guys until you and your boys got them talking. We've been looking for them all day. Been wreaking havoc on our patrols. You're here to tell us the war is over? No. I'm afraid not. We're trying to make contact with a platoon from the 365th. They have been cut off. The buffalo soldiers? You know where they are? You've got to come with me, Sir. The Germans have been reinforcing this area all day. Mm-hmm. Maybe they're pulling back. End of the war, you'd think everybody would be ready to stop the fighting. Nobody wants to give up their territory. The French press us to attack, Germans defend. There's a lot of that happening. Now, if you're looking for the 92nd, I can't say I envy you. Hill 473. With three German battalions between us and them. How can you be sure they're up there? Germans have been laying a thick blanket of artillery, concentrating on that hill. If they are anywhere, they are there. You think we'll able to get through the German line? It might be possible. Still got a lot of open field out there. Germans send out patrols and shoot at our Patrols. You got artillery positions here and here. With a little, uh, mix of machine guns - guarding the flanks. - That's a lot of area to cover. The Germans are laid in for a siege. Whoever is on that hill is gonna get hit hard. And you're sure this isn't your guys? No. My platoons are all accounted for. And you're gonna have a hell of a time finding them if they're not on that hill. Can I have this? Yeah. If it were me, Sir, I would leave those colored boys out there. The war is almost up. There's no reason to go risking yourself for it. Thanks for the map. Anything else I can do for you? Yeah. A nice warm place for my men to sleep? We got a warm beer cellar. - I like warm beer. - I like warm beer. Captain I don't know what you're doing, but good luck. Thank you, Lieutenant, to the cellar. Let's go. Come in. Am I disturbing you, Sir? Not at all. Come on in. I just thought you should know. The Germans have signed the ceasefire. It just came over the wire. What did they finally agree to? Summed up... a cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of German forces to behind the Rhine. Allied occupation of the Rhine land and bridge heads further east, the... preservation of infrastructure. The surrender of aircraft, warships and military material. The complete release of allied prisoners of war, in turn, civilians and eventual reparation. No release of German prisoners and... no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany. - The war is over. - The war is over, Sir. When? "Terms will come into effect 11:00 a.m. November, the 11th." November the 11th. Does the president know? We got word from his chief of staff - and came right to you. - Hmm. And they agree? President Wilson couldn't be happier. Gonna make the announcement to Congress and then the country. Sir. - There's something else? - Yes, Sir. French high command have requested that we continue to press the Germans 'til the last minute. Yes. So the French are looking for more territory? It would appear that way, Sir. Sometimes I wonder the price of being an ally. A lot of good boys are gonna die. A lot of good boys already have. All right. Well... tell the commanders there will be no let up on the orders. They are to follow the same orders till 11:00 a.m. Sir? We will hunt those Hun bastards until the very end. - 11:00 a.m., Colonel. - It will be done, Sir. - Hey, Jack? - Yes, Sir? Has there been any word about those negros? None that I know of, Sir. We still don't have their location. No, Sir, we-- we don't. May I ask you a question, Sir? Sure. Why those negros? You do know my nickname, don't you? Blackjack. I was the leader of the tenth cavalry when it was a black unit. We ran up San Juana Hill together. Best goddamn soldiers. Best fighting force I've ever had the pleasure to command. I'll put the word down the wire, Sir. Let me know if you hear anything. Yes, Sir. The war is over. Sir? Sir, are you okay? Hmm? - You okay? - Yeah. I-- Yeah. I'm just tired. - Yeah. I bet. - I'm good. Oh, yeah. Please. Good. That's enough. You want me to tell the others to get some rest? No, no. Let them-- let them do what they're doing. You know the war could come to an end before daylight. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. It's funny though... that they would send us out so close to the end. Well, maybe it's important. It's just a lot of trouble to go rescue a bunch of lost black boys. Do you remember when we hit the French coast? My boots got soaked with saltwater. I'd walk around and they would squish for days. Well, when we were marching up to the front that's, uh-- that's the first time I ever saw a black soldier. - French, right? - Yeah. They were marching back from the front. And they wore these, what I suppose was ears and fingers around their necks like on a string. Do you remember that? No. I don't remember that. - No? - No. Mm-mm. I just-- I remember thinking how strange that was, I mean, to wear that around. And then I found out later that these blacks were-- were straight from the French-African colonies. And in their tribes, they would wear the ears and the fingers of their-- of their enemies. You know it would show, like, the true warrior spirit. You know like-- like bravery in combat like, uh-- - like trophies... - Hmm. ...something like that. - Like the Indians? - Yeah. Just like the Indians. Now that would be a sight to see. Warriors Or barbarians, huh? We could ask some Indians. We could ask some Indians. Find me an Indian. Can I have a refill? Good, good. Thank you. You know, um, Roberts and I joined the army at the same time. - Yeah? - Yeah, we came up as officers at the same time too. - No shit. - Yeah. Huh. So how did he come to be in command of them colored fellas? Well, he always said that the color of a man's skin did not make the man. I suppose it doesn't. A lot of good it did him, he's dead. We move out at dawn. - Right, Sir. - Oh, if, uh-- if the war ends - while I'm sleeping... - Uh-huh. - ...let me sleep. - Yeah. Night, Sir. Hey, bumpkin, what are you sewing on that old rag? I'm fixing it. Yeah. Aren't you supposed to retire an old flag? Well, yeah. But she got a lot of life left in her. Yeah, a lot of life. Drop it Cardinni, all right? Leave him be. Can we just play the game, stop bending my damn cards. I guess not. You think he wants to lose some money? Everyone knows niggers love to gamble. I told you to stop calling him that. Why? Every man deserves respect, 'til he don't. Some of your pa's country wisdom? Missoula. Where do you think you're going? Away from you. Yeah. Have fun. You want some coffee? Thank you. So you want to come join us? No. Not really. Yeah. I don't blame you. You know, they really are good guys. I'm sure they are. Yeah. Is that a letter to back home? I write my mom as often as I can. Well, I'm sure she likes that. My mom, uh, she can't read. You know, the thing is I know she can't read, but... each letter back home is proof I'm still alive. So, I write. So where are you from? Brooklyn. - Ah. - Born and raised. You like it there? Too cold in the winter too hot in the summer Oh, wait a minute you're describing Virginia... ...that's what I'm thinking. My mom, man, she'll sit on the porch all day waiting for one of these letters. When this whole mess of a war started, I was down at the recruiter's office the next day. My mom, she begged me not to go. Didn't want me dying in some white man's war. So why did you go then? I figured if you white folks saw us colors fighting for your freedom... you'd see it right to give us our freedom. Hmm. Catholic? Yes, Sir. Baptist myself. Oh, all right. You know, back in the forest, I saw you praying over the wounded, all professional like. Uh, back home I was studying to be a priest. And you're okay with killing? Back at the church I studied at... every now and then a group of kids would come in on a field trip. The priest would ask them what they all wanted to be when they grew up. And they each said something different, you know, policeman, fireman, cowboy. I believe I will pay for my sins. We all will. But I was willing to sacrifice my soul... so that they wouldn't have to. I guess we're both fighting for what we believe in, huh? Yeah, I guess we are. If you're praying, do mind putting in a good word for me? - Of course. - Thank you. What do you think happened here? It's got the Corporal spooked. Sir, why have we stopped? We should really keep moving. Private? Did you see something? I don't know, Sir. Something doesn't feel right. A lot of dead bodies, no sign of a fight. Something's wrong, Sir. Maybe they got something good on them. Maybe they've got some food. Yeah you got any requests for me? Hey, hey you shouldn't disrespect the dead. Why? Pinch! Son of a bitch, what happened? I was just looking for souvenirs. Honest. German grenade, Sir, - booby trap. - Is it bad? How bad is it? It's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad. You'll be fine, you're going to be fine. - You're going to be fine. - Put some whiskey on it. I feel cold, I feel cold. You're going to be fine, Pincelli. Hold on. Put some whiskey on the wound. - I don't want to die. - You're not going to die. God, I don't want to die here. - I don't want to die here. - You're not going to die. - Give him some whiskey. - I don't want to die, Sir. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Come on. Help me put pressure on it. - I gotta get back-- - You're going back home. You're going back home. You're going back to 41st Street. We're going back home. - Here. Give it to my brother. - You give it to him yourself. You're going to give it to him yourself. You're going to give it to him yourself. No, no, no, we're going home. We're going home. God, I don't want to die here, Card. No, no. Eternal rest be granted on him, oh Lord. Son of a bitch! It's your fault. It's your fucking fault. Come on, come on. Get off, get off. - Let me get him! - Cardinni! - I didn't want that! - Cardinni, please! - I didn't want that! - Cardinni, relax! Get off of me. Hey, hey! Listen, you're out of line. You need to get your head on straight. I get it. Do you get me? Do you get me? Great idea, Sir. We lost two of our guys doing it. Sir! Why are we out here? We're getting killed for a bunch of niggers! Guys, uh... ...a couple of things. I, uh... I suffer from, um... from shell shock. And I don't understand it. I don't know what it is. I, uh-- I'm not a coward. I don't-- I don't think I am. But when we took that German line... and your buddies were getting cut up... instead of being a leader, I, uh... I disintegrated. I, uh... I wanted to run, I wanted to leave the war. I jumped up into the line of fire and, uh, a black fella stopped me and pulled me back into safety. And, uh... here I am. Now these, uh-- these men that we're looking for... black or white, it doesn't matter! Now when you go home, sure, you can do what you want, think what you want. You can treat black people any way you like. When you meet your maker, he'll make decisions about the choices that you've conjured. But here, today... now... those men are soldiers in the United States Army, I don't care what the color of their skin is. We have orders to assist in their evacuation. If you want to leave, leave. Now's your chance. I understand. I'm staying. I'm staying. Bury your buddies before you go. Sergeant. Sir? Here's your warfare right there. I would say it is, Sir. Too late for this one. Something I can do for you, Colonel? We received word from the 77th, Sir, about the lost unit. They may still be alive, Sir. Holed up on Hill 174. Alive? The Germans seem to think so. Let's go get them. Bring them home. Yes, Sir. Who the heck is doing the shooting? Hell if I know. Watch the trees. We're coming out. - Johnson? - I'll be damned, Cain! Man, am I glad to see you. - Sorry, Sir. - Uh, Corporal Johnson, recon element of 365th. We were expecting a patrol. Didn't know they'd be on horses. William Rivers, Captain, I company. Uh, you with the Buffalo soldiers? Yes, Sir. - Well, let's go find them. - Yes, Sir. This way. Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard. Yes, Sir. They came and they, uh, they hit us hard. How long you fellas been up here? Only a couple days, uh. Hell it's hard to keep track of sometimes. No reinforcements? You are the first soldiers we've seen. Who and where is your commanding officer? Oh, Sergeant Perry, he-- he's in there. All right. Uh, Sergeant, position the men and wait here. - Yes, Sir. - Where do you want me, sir? - Come with me. - All right, boys. Let's find some spots here and up the road. Split up. Son of a bitch. Awe, man we didn't know if you made it. Ah, you know me, Sarge. - Captain? - William Rivers. You brought our man back. Thank you. - Are you here to reinforce us? - No, Sergeant. Well, how many men did you bring? There's five of us left. Well, that's not much of a relief for us. Well, I have orders to bring you and your boys back to friendly lines. Those orders come directly from the command staff in Washington D.C. The war is almost finished, Sergeant. It's time to evacuate this hill. Yeah, we've heard. The Germans been dropping those on us. And so why do you stay? Well, with all due respect, Sir, we will not be surrendering to the enemy. Well, with all due respect, Sergeant, I lost two good men getting here. Private, would you step outside, I'd like to speak with Rivers. Yes, Sergeant. I am sorry you lost your men. Do you have any news on Captain Roberts? Captain Roberts is dead. He was your friend? He was a good man. Do you know how many men I've lost taking this hill? No, Sergeant. Twenty-seven. Brave men. All of them. I'm sure they were. We landed in France this summer. Trained to fight, expecting to fight. They gave us shovels instead of guns. We dug ditches, carried ammo... hauled supplies. Captain Roberts begged and pleaded for a real assignment. A chance to get in the fight. They told us that we were unfit to fight, not ready for war. It must have been difficult to listen to them. One day a real assignment came, a real fight. We will hold this hill until reinforcements arrive, or this war ends. You see, Captain, these are our friendly lines, and we will not be abandoning them. Are, uh, you aware... that after the war, any land that's held by allies will, uh, be lost to the Germans? No. This hill that you've captured, Sergeant, is deep behind enemy lines. Several miles. They are going to want it back. Hell, they are going to need it back. They're going to fight like dogs. Doesn't change anything, We will hold this hill. I understand why you're here, Sir. We're choosing this fight. You don't have to. Well, what if I ordered you to? This is not your fight, Captain Rivers. You and your men still have plenty of time to get back to friendly lines and your... white friends. You let me know what you decide. Sir? What did he say? This is your company, John. You don't have to follow me anymore. Sir, if it's all the same to you, I think I'll finish this ride with you. So when do we leave? We don't. Our orders are to bring these men home. Stay and defend this hill. That's right. And then we'll bring them home. Sir, may I have a moment please? Germans are going to surround this place any moment, - how do we hold-- - We're going to stay and fight. - Will-- - We are going to stay and fight. Sir? Can I say something? Back home, the color of our skin divides us. But out here... we're all one. You are all my brothers. And I will never forget the bond we share... or the blood we spilled. Thank you. Hell, I couldn't make it back alone anyway, probably get lost. We have been scrounging what we can. Couple of B.A.R.s, rifles, grenades, enough ammunition to last. Couple of French Cha-Cha's, but they don't work a damn. Uh, and these captured German machine guns All right. All right look, we-- we are here, all right? The Germans are going to want to hit us at our weakest point, where is that? Oh, there. The south side. It also bumps up along those trees and it'll be hard to see if enemy is approaching. Okay. Now, if we position our machine guns at the top of the apex, Germans are going to want to take those out for sure, so we don't. We put our machine guns on the north side just below the crest. That will only work if the Germans take the hill. Right, that's why we bait the Germans. We put men at the base of the south side down here. When the Germans attack, we feint a retreat up and over the hill. The Germans will follow. - A trap. - Yeah, that's correct. It could work... but what if they follow, then we've lost our position? No, no. This. This little round top we hold it at all costs. Or Custer's last stand. I hope you boys know how to dig. - Let's get to work. - Yes, Sir. Sir. Thank you. Soldier, thanks. You know how to work that thing, Cardinni? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - Simple enough? - Sir. - Yeah? The men are dug in as best they can be. Good. Machine guns, grenades, mortar rounds, - and enough ammunition to last. - What about our flanks? - Men on both sides. - Okay. I guess all we can do now is wait. No. Thank you. - Guess I'll go check on the men. - Yeah okay. - Private. - Uh... I want you to have this, Sir. Sir? Sir? The war's almost over huh, Sir? Yeah it is. Do you think we can hold out until then? Well, we'll see in the morning. Amazing isn't it? What's that? Same sky as back home... ...just worlds apart. - Private? - Sir. How does it feel to slap a superior officer in the face? What are you talking about, Sir? I know it was you. I know you saved me. - I didn't save anyone. - No, why did you do it? You didn't owe me anything. Everyone gets scared, Sir. Sometimes all you need is just a little encouragement to get through it. - Sir? - Sergeant. German officer came in under a white flag. What does he want? He wants to talk to you, Sir. I have told you, Corporal. Captain, your men are a bit jumpy. - Corporal? - He's clean, Sir. May I put my hands down? By all means. Would any of you gentlemen have a smoke? You cannot beat Southern American tobacco. You came under a white flag, Captain, what do you want? Always to the point, Americans. I am here for your surrender. Explain. By now you have heard the war is over tomorrow. Eleven in the morning. Correct. Clearly you can see your position here is pointless. And there is no need for more bloodshed. I, uh... I think we're gonna stay. These colored boys here have fought bravely. I admire it. But it is foolishness to continue. I have two regiments of troops and artillery moving on this hill as we speak. You are surrounded. There's no hope to survive when we attack. Clearly you don't want all your men to die. Do you, Captain? Corporal, Private, would you please escort this Captain back to our lines safely. - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. I will give you until dawn to change your mind. But then I start the guns. - Sir? - Hmm? Yeah. Still no sign of the enemy. Well, I trust the German to keep his word. Artillery is going to be tough tomorrow, Sir. Yeah. Well, I have an idea about that. How many? Looks like three. - Seventy-sixes? - Yeah. It's going to be hard to get those guns, Sir. Well, we just need to buy time we don't need the guns. We've got to get at and destroy that ammo. Bite the head off the snake. No ammo, no steal rain. Then they'll have to attack our positions, force us out. Sir, I'd like to lead the men in. Give them Huns some hell. You sure about that, Sergeant? Yes, Sir. All right, listen to me, you get in there and you hit them, and you get out as fast as you can. This is your hill, Sergeant. I want you back here. Yes, Sir. All right men, this is it. Light, fast, that's what you don't need. Conserve your weapons and your ammo. If it ain't black, kill it. You gotta get the fuck out of here I'm gonna blow this thing. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Get ready you know what to do. Here they come. - I'm out. - Me too. Reload. There. - They're trying to flank us. - Not much we can do about it. You can't let them get behind us. You guys go, I'll hold them back. Come on. You sure? Just go, just go. You guys keep them entertained, I'll make a break on them. Okay? One... two... three! Sniper, sniper! - I'm hit. - Shit! What do we do? Stay there, stay there. - I don't see him. - Shit. Sir, I think we should fall back. You're right fall back. Fall back! Fall back! Thomas? Thomas, what happened? Where were you going? We're gonna fall back. We're gonna do this together. You and me, we're doing this together. It's been a pleasure. Sir. Sir, we've got to go. No. You hold on to that, all right. Take care of yourself. Fall back, fall back! I'm finished. You two, go, leave me. I'll get him. We won't leave you. Go now, go now. Before it's too late. All right, on three. One... two... three. I got you. Quinn, come on. Quinn, no. Quinn, come on, keep on going. Quinn, we have to keep going. Quinn! Let's go. Come on. General. Sir, all the commanders are pressing forward attacking the Germans all along their lines. Resistance? Germans are putting up a fight. They refuse to believe they're beaten. Bring the boys home. Sir. You tell those commanders to keep pressing forward... - till 11:00 a.m. - Sir. Jack. Yes, Sir? What do you think? About what, Sir? The Germans, can we beat 'em? I believe it is not the last time we will see the Germans in field, Sir. Yeah. This'll have to be done all over again. I'll send the message down the line. Captain? I'm okay, Private. Sir, do you mind? Now they'll know who holds this hill. Half the men are gone Sir. Most of the rest are wounded. What about ammunition? Not much, some men are only down to a few rounds left. Here they come. All right, we can't retreat. And God, if we stay here... Affix bayonets, we affix bayonets. You take the left flank, you go center, I take the right flank and we sweep down the hill. - You mean charge. - Yeah, we charge on them while the Germans are coming up the hill. - Do you understand? - Yes, Sir. Yeah. Okay, move out. Fix bayonets, let's go. - Fix bayonets! - Fix bayonets! Private Cain. - You are hit! - It's okay, it's okay. Medic! Medic! 11:03, the war is over. I never had a chance to thank you. You don't have to. Listen, war does not determine who's right. Only who's left. But what we did here, what we did here... this is right. This is our greatest victory. Read it. Read it, please. "My dearest William, since we were children, I knew you'd always be there for me.
