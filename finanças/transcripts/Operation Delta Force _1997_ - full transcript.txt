THREE MINUTES TO DEADLINE, CAPTAIN. REMEMBER THEY MADE IT CLEAR ANYTHING UNEXPECTED, THE MINISTER IS DEAD. OKAY PEOPLE, IT’S CRUNCH TIME. I WANT IT QUICK AND I WANT IT CLEAN. 16-4, GOING IN. (GUNSHOT) UGH! (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) OOH! (WATCH TIMER BEEP) (GUNFIRE) OOH! AH! IT’S CLEAR. LET'S GO. I’VE GOT HIM. FIFTH ROOM FROM THE EAST CORNER. I’M GOING IN. DAMN IT! IT’S A DECOY. BOWERS IS DOWN. LET’S GO, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BINGO, CAPTAIN. 16TH FLOOR, NORTHWEST CORNER. FOUR TANGOS, HOSTAGES SEATED. (GUNSHOTS) CLEAR. CLEAR. MR. BANDA, CAPTAIN LANG, DELTA FORCE. YOU’RE SAFE, SIR. IT’S OVER. 2 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS. PEOPLE, THAT’S NOT BAD. NICE JOB GUYS. CAPTAIN, I THINK WE ARE READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SCENARIO. DO YOU REALLY THESE A.F.A NUTS WOULD TRY SOMETHING THIS CRAZY? YEAH WELL, THEY ARE FANATICS, SERGEANT. THEY’RE DANGEROUS. YOU SEE, THEY BELIEVE THAT SOUTH AFRICA BELONGS TO THEM. AND THEY’VE MADE IT CLEAR, THEY WILL RESORT TO ANYTHING, TO OBTAIN THEIR STATUS. THE "AFRIKANER LAND". CAPTAIN, HOW DID OUR LIEUTENANT YONKER PERFORM? EXCELLENT, SIR. FOR A WOMAN. NICE JOB, CAPTAIN. THANK YOU. VERY. ARE YOU HUNGRY? ALL RIGHT. YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE MOZAMBIQUE, MAJOR. WE WILL FOLLOW THE MOZAMBIQUE RIVER. IT WILL LEAD US STRAIGHT TO THE LAB. E.T.A., 30 SECONDS. WAIT FOR ME, I WON’T BE LONG. YOU GOT IT, MAJOR. DR. WELLS? MAJOR JEFFREY TIPTON. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, DOCTOR. THIS HERE IS WENDELL BRENNER, MY RIGHT HAND. YES, OF COURSE. THIS WAY PLEASE. DR. WELLS, YOUR DEVOLOPMENT OF THIS NEW ANTI-SERUM IS A MILESTONE BREAKTHROUGH. EVERYONE AT AMRIID IS ECSTATIC, AS I’M SURE YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. YEAH, WE’RE PRETTY HAPPY HERE, TOO. JACKSON. I HAVE TO ADMIT, I’VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR HIV RESEARCH WITH KEEN INTEREST. PRELIMINARY RESULTS LOOK MOST PROMISING. WELL, I’M FLATTERED, DOCTOR. I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH YOU. I’M UNDER THE GUN TO GET BACK TO AMRIID. WASHINGTON IS VERY ANXIOUS TO RECEIVE THIS ANTI-SERUM. UM, GOOD. QUITE A SET UP YOU HAVE HERE. IS THIS THE GROUND LEVEL? 25 METERS UNDERGROUND. I FEEL SECURE. WELL PROTECTED. SECURE, YES. A BIT TOO DULL FOR MY LIKING. GOING FOR THE NEXT TEST. WELL, THERE THEY ARE. THEY? I THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ONLY 1 VIAL OF ANTI-SERUM. THAT IS CORRECT. WELL IF YOU DON’T MIND MY ASKING DOCTOR, WHAT’S IN THE SECOND CASE? I’M SORRY, DOCTOR BUT THAT IS STRICTLY NEED TO KNOW. GENERAL WEST’S ORDERS. IS THERE A TELELPHONE I CAN USE? OF COURSE. IN THE OFFICE. (BUSY SIGNAL) (ALARMS RINGING) THE CODE. COME ON. MOVE ON UP! DON’T SHOOT. TAKE IT EASY. DR. BRENNER. WHERE ARE THEY? LEVEL 3. IN THE VAULT. AND THE CODES? HERE. EXCELLENT WORK, DOCTOR. DR. WELLS, ON BEHALF OF THE LEADERSHIP OF "AFRIKANERS FOR AFRIKANER LAND", I SALUTE YOUR BRILLIANCE AND YOUR PERSISTANCE. YOU HAVE GIVEN US THE PERFECT MEANS TO OUR MOST NOBLE END. AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. HEY! HEY! KALLA-- (SCREAMS) I SAVE NO HOSTAGES. YEAH. MOVE OUT! AFFIRMATIVE. LET’S MOVE. DID YOU FIND THOSE COORDINATES? ADMIRAL? YEAH. WHAT DO WE GOT? IT LOOKS LIKE THE A.F.A. IS BEHIND IT, SIR. IT’S A GOOD THING WHOEVER THEY HAD INSIDE, DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT THE BUGS. WE HAVE A 99% PROBABLE ON THAT GUY, JOHANN NASH. YEAH, THE GOOD GENERAL’S RIGHT HAND MAN. WHAT DO WE GOT ON HIM? A B.A. IN SOCIOLOGY FROM DUKE UNIVERSITY. GRADUATED WITH HONORS, NO LESS. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, HIS SABER RATTLING HAS BEEN MAKING A LOT OF NOISE. ANY SIGN OF HIM YET? OUR SATELLITE SCREEN IS STILL CLUTTERED BY THE WEATHER PATTERN, SIR. I WANT A VIDEO LINK WITH SUNLAND, NILES, ROONEY AND WEST. NOW. YES, SIR. TO BETTER TEST THE ANTI-SERUM, WELLS’ ZAIRE STRAIN IS A PLATFORM TO ENGINEER AN EVEN DEADLIER EBOLA VARIANT. BUT BEFORE THE BREAKTHROUGH TWO DAYS AGO, INFECTION WITH EVEN RUN OF THE MILL ZAIRE, MEANT ALMOST SUDDEN DEATH. 90% MORTALITY RATE. IT MAY LOOK HARMLESS, BUT IT’S A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE KILLER. AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF SOME FIVE DAYS. ACCELRATES WITH FRIGHTENENING SPEED. NECROTIZING INTERNAL ORGANS. DESTROYING A HUMAN LIFE IN AS LITTLE AS A WEEK. WONDERFUL. FANTASTIC. WEST, WHY IN HELL DID YOU SEND IN JUST ONE GUY FOR THIS STUFF? WE HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT A MOLE INSIDE THE COMPLEX. ONE GUY, WEST. AND A SCIENTIST, NO LESS. LOOK, TIPTON HAS WORN THE BERET. (TV) GENTLEMAN, CAN WE STOP THE FINGER POINTING AND NAME CALLING FOR NOW. WE GOT AN EXTREMELY VOLATILE SITUATION HERE. LET’S DEAL WITH IT. NASH MADE OFF WITH THE ENTIRE SUPPLY OF ANTI-SERUM. ALL OF IT. THE ANTI-SERUM GIVES HIM THE ABILITY TO RELEASE THE VIRUS INDISCRIMINATELY, THEN TREAT THOSE HE DIDN’T INTEND TO CONTAMINATE. HE DOESN’T HAVE TO RELEASE THE VIRUS AT ALL. JUST THREATENING TO RELEASE IT, IS ENOUGH. ADMIRAL, WHO IS MOBILE? THE ONLY UNIT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IS THE DELTA SQUAD. THEY ARE JUST WRAPPING UP A TRAINING EXCERCISE WITH SOUTH AFRICAN SPECIAL FORCES AND TACT MAG. SKIP, LANG AND COMPANY. THEY ARE READY AND ABLE AT ANY TIME. HERE IS TO THE FUTURE PAPA SPARKS. SPARKY. DOC. LET’S HOPE THE KID INHERITS HIS MOTHER’S LOOKS. LET’S HOPE NOT. (LAUGHTER) SO, WHAT’S IT TO BE? A BOY OR A GIRL? WE WANTED TO KEEP IT A SURPRISE. EXCUSE ME, SIR. THERE IS AN URGENT COMMUNICATION FROM ADMIRAL HENSHAW FOR CAPTAIN LANG. AND THE ADMIRAL WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALSO, SIR. THANK YOU. LET’S GO. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE US, GENTLEMAN. ADMIRAL. CAPTAIN, I REALIZE YOU AND YOUR MEN ARE OVERDUE FOR SOME R&R, BUT WE’VE GOT AN OAKTREE ALERT HERE. I’M LISTENING, SIR. AS WE SPEAK, A SQUAD OF A.F.A. EXTREMISTS ARE IN POSESSION OF 2 VERY IMPORTANT VIALS THEY STOLE FROM THE U.N. RESEARCH FACILITY IN MOZAMBIQUE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT’S IN THE VIALS, SIR? NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN. BUT ANY MINUTE, YOU SHOULD RECEIVE A TRANSMISSION FROM GENERAL WEST ON THE SPECIFICS. ALL RIGHT GENTLEMEN, LISTEN UP. NASH AND HIS WANNABE NAZIS ARE BY NO MEANS A PUSHOVER. THE A.F.A. IS LITTERED WITH FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN SPECIAL FORCES COMMANDOS. ADD TO THAT, THE NEED TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE VIALS, I WOULD SAY WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US. QUESTIONS. YEAH. WHAT ABOUT INTEL? AT ADMIRAL HENSHAW’S REQUEST, THE SOUTH AFRICAN OPERATIVE WILL MEET US AT THE LAB. NOW SHE HAS NOT BEEN BRIEFED. WHAT SHE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NO, I AM NOT, SERGEANT. SHE, AS IN LIEUTENANT MARIE YONKERS. I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE OPPOSED TO A WOMAN JOINING US IN A LIVE SITUATION, BUT LET ME WARN YOU SHE HAS MORE THAN PROVEN HERSELF IN OUR JOINT TRAINING EXCERCISES. AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED, SHE'S THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB EVEN THOUGH SHE IS NOT A MAN. I DO NOT WANT ANYONES PREDJUDICES OR HARD ON JEOPARDIZING THIS MISSION. IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR THEM. WHEN THE OPERATION IS OVER. SHE DELIVERED AT 22:12 E.S.T. ADMIRAL THOUGHT IT BEST THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. CONGRATULATIONS DOCTOR, YOU ARE A FATHER. IT’S A GIRL. CONGRATULATIONS, DOC. DAMN, I LEFT MY CIGARS ON THE SHIP. GENTLEMEN, WE ARE GOING IN SEVEN, NEAT AND TIGHT. AND WE WILL BE COMING OUT SEVEN, NEAT AND TIGHT. GOOD LUCK. CAPTAIN, THAT’S THE AMRIID COURIER. OVER HERE. TIPTON. DID YOU SAY TIPTON? I SEE FRIENDLY FIRE DIDN’T IMPEDE YOUR RISE THROUGH THE RANKS, MAJOR. DO I KNOW YOU, SOLDIER? LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT. MY BROTHER’S WIFE THREW DARTS AT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH UNTIL THERE WAS NO PHOTOGRAPH LEFT. LANG. CAPTAIN LANG, DELTA. I SEE. LOOK, I’M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BROTHER’S DEATH, CAPTAIN. THERE WAS A FULL REVIEW. I WAS CLEARED OF ANY WRONG DOING. I READ THE REPORT, MAJOR. I ALSO TALKED TO A FEW OF THE GUYS WHO KNOW D.A. CONSENSUS WAS THAT YOU HAD THE SKILLS TO WEAR THE BERET, YOU JUST DIDN’T HAVE THE BELLY. NO, THAT’S WRONG. I HAD THE BELLY, IT WAS MY HEART THAT WASN’T IN IT. AFTER LEBANON, YOU TRADED YOUR GUN IN FOR A MICROSCOPE. COUNTER TERRORISM, ISN’T THE ONLY BATTLE GROUND, CAPTAIN. IT’S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I HOPPED ON THE OLD BIKE, BUT I WOULD SAY I CAN STILL RIDE JUST FINE. I WOULD SAY YOU SCREWED UP BIG TIME, MAJOR. OTHERWISE, WE WOULDN’T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION NOW, WOULD WE. LOOK, IT’S MY JOB TO BRING BACK THE ANTI-SERUM. IT WAS YOUR JOB. NOW IT’S MY JOB, MAJOR. BUT LET’S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THIS IS MY COMMAND, MAJOR. AND IF I HAD MY WAY, YOU WOULDN’T BE WITHIN A COUNTRY MILE OF THIS OPERATION. IT’S A GOOD THING THAT YOU DON’T HAVE YOUR WAY. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT IT’S YOUR COMMAND. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON HERE THAT DOESN’T ADD UP. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING BACK ONE VIAL. INSTEAD, I WAS GIVEN TWO. I TOOK AN INVENTROY AFTER THE PERPETRATORS LEFT, THE ONLY THING MISSING WERE THE TWO VIALS. THAT’S ALL THEY TOOK. CAPTAIN, G.I. JOANNE IS HERE. SERGEANT, YOU WILL REFER TO HER AS LIEUTENANT YONKER. I DON’T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL YOU AGAIN. YES, SIR. FANCY MEETING YOU HERE, LIEUTENANT. YOU READY FOR THE REAL THING? WE’RE MOVING OUT, MAJOR. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAG ALONG, I SUGGEST YOU TRY SHOOTING THE RIGHT GUY THIS TIME. CAPTAIN, DON’T YOU FORGET I OUTRANK YOU. YOU MAY NOT LIKE ME, BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG TO UNDER ESTIMATE WHAT I BRING TO THIS MISSION. GIVEN THE PARTICULARS OF THE GEOGRAPHY, WE HAVE GOT THREE LOGICAL TRAVEL VECTORS. THE RIVER HERE, THE RIVER TRACKS HERE, AND THE ROAD UP HERE. TAKING THE LIKELY FOOT SPEED AND ACCOUNTING FOR REST TIME, THEY SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE RIGHT ALONG HERE. WHATEVER THE DECISION, WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE NOW. THERE’S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT A TRIBUTARY TO ZAMBIZIA, TRAIN AND A ROAD. WHERE WOULD YOU BE HEADED, HUTCH? THESE GUYS DON’T HAVE TIME TO PLAY IT SMART, CAPTAIN. THEY ARE HEADED FOR THE WATER. NO WAY. LET’S PRETEND THESE TANGOS HAVE BRAINS. IT’S TOO LONG. WELL, EXACTLY. IF I WERE THEM, I WOULD COUNT ON YOU TO THINK THE SAME THING. I’LL TAKE THE TRAIN. FOR THE SAME REASON HE LIKES THE WATER. THESE PEOPLE WANT TO DO TWO THINGS. THEY WANT TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE AND GET OUT OF MOZAMBIQUE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD SAY THE ROAD BEST MEETS THAT CRITERIA. LET’S DO IT, GENTLEMEN. WHAT’S UP BETWEEN CAPTAIN AND MAJOR TIPTON? TIPTON GOT HIS BROTHER KILLED. NO WAY. YEAH. LAID HIM OUT COLD. THE DAY IS YOUNG, BOWERS. THE DAY IS YOUNG. WHEN PUSH COME TO SHOVE, ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIRE ON YOUR OWN KIND? LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU, SERGEANT. A VAST MAJORITY OF MY KIND ACTUALLY FIND THE RACIST BELIEFS OF THE A.F.A. DESPICABLE. I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE YOU COME FROM AMERICA, DOESN’T MEAN YOU RUN AROUND AT NIGHT WEARING A DUNCE CAP AND A BED SHEET. LIKE THOSE CROSS BURNING MORONS FROM THE SOUTH. DOES IT? HEY, YONKER. DON’T MIND HIM. IT’S NOTHING PERSONAL. IT’S JUST THAT YOU ARE THE FIRST WOMAN TO JOIN-- YES, YES, SERGEANT. I AM WELL AWARE OF IT. BELIEVE ME. WELL, I THINK IT’S GREAT THAT YOU ARE HERE. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU LOOK IN THOSE FATIGUES. I HEARD THAT, SERGEANT. COLONEL. CAPTAIN, WE HAVE BEEN CIRCLING AROUND HERE FOR HALF AN HOUR. WHY NOT CHECK ON THE TRAIN. IF I WANT YOUR INPUT, MAJOR, I’LL ASK FOR IT. ALL RIGHT. FINE. FAIR ENOUGH. JUST ANSWER ME ONE QUESTION. WHAT’S IN THE SECOND CASE? IF I KNEW, I WILL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. 500 MILLIGRAMS OF EBOLA ZAIRE. NO. IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE. NOT ONLY WAS IT ALL ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE LAB, WE GOT PLENTY OF IT ON ICE AT AMRIID. THAT’S WHAT WE WERE TOLD, MAJOR. IT’S NOT MY JOB TO ANALYZE. JUST TO FOLLOW ORDERS. MAYBE. BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING STRAIGHT WITH US. THEY ARE KEEPING SOMETHING FROM US, CAPTAIN. ALL OF US. SIR, U.A.B. JUST CAME ONLINE. NONE TOO SOON. I THINK WE’VE GOT SOMETHING. IT’S COMING THROUGH NOW. YES! LOOKS LIKE NASH CHOSE THE TRAIN SCENARIO. ODDS ARE HE’S HEADING FOR THE COAST. WHERE IS THAT? GPS IN ONE MOMENT, SIR. IT’S CHIMBO STATION. 12 MILES NORTH, NORTHEAST OF DELTA’S CURRENT POSITION. WE’VE GOT TO STOP THAT TRAIN. NOW FIND THE BEST POINT TO STAGE AN INTERCEPTION. THERE, SIR. IT’S AN HOUR UP THE LINE BUT IT’S PROBABLY OUR BEST BET. THE TRACKS HERE ARE OVER AN EXTREMELY HIGH AND NARROW BRIDGE. A BRIDGE? COULD BE. LOOKS GOOD. CAPTAIN LANG, ADMIRAL HENSHAW FOR YOU, SIR. PUT HIM THROUGH. CAPTAIN, LOOKS LIKE NASH HIJACKED THE EASTBOUND TRAIN. BOMBING IS NOT AN OPTION. TOO MANY CIVILIANS ON BOARD. YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE GOING TO INTERCEPT HIM AT THE ALBERTINA BRIDGE. HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT, SIR? FIRST OFF, HAVE YOUR PILOT DROP ALL BUT TWO MEN AT THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE. YES SIR. WHAT ABOUT MY OTHER TWO MEN? HAVE THE PILOT TAKE THEM TO THE CHOMBE STATION. THERE WILL BE A LOCOMOTIVE WAITING FOR THEM. USE IT TO BLOCK THE TRUCKS ON THE BRIDGE. IT’LL FORCE NASH TO STOP, THEN HE’S ALL YOURS. BOWERS, YOU’RE THE ADMIRAL. LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU ARE READY TO ROLL. CAPTAIN, BOWERS. EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTH ON THIS END. EXCELLENT SERGEANT, KEEP ME POSTED. CAPTAIN, WE ARE TWO MINUTES FROM THE OBJECTIVE. ROGER THAT. EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE ON THIS END. CAPTAIN, WE ARE IN POSITION. WELL DONE. GO AHEAD AND JOIN THE REST OF THE FORCE. STOP THAT TRAIN. STOP THE TRAIN. GET DOWN! GO ON! LACKEYS OF THE NEW BLACK GOVERNMENT. THE FUTURE OF OUR NATION IS IN YOUR HANDS. COME ON JACK, THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO STOP THAT TRAIN. HOW ABOUT THIS, SIR. THE TUNGALA TUNNEL. IF WE BLOCKED THE EASTERN END, WE MIGHT GET LUCKY AND TRAP NASH INSIDE. GOOD. I LIKE THAT. GET ME THE CAPTAIN OF THE CORAL SEA RIGHT AWAY. WE NEED IN AIR STRIKE SQUADRON UP AND RUNNING, NOW. GET DOWN! TARGET AT 279. MISSLES AWAY, OVER. A DIRECT HIT. ATTENTION EASTBOUND 225. THE EASTERN END OF THE TUNNEL YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER IS BLOCKED. REPEAT, THE TUNNEL IS BLOCKED. STOP THE TRAIN. JOHANN NASH! YOU ARE IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN SURRENDER THE MATERIAL YOU SEIZED IN THE LAB AND WALK OUT OF HERE ALIVE. OR BE CARRIED OUT IN A BODY BAG. IT’S YOUR CHOICE. WHO AM I SPEAKING TO? A CAPTAIN IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY FULLY AUTHORIZED TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MY COUNTRY. I AM SENDING OUT A MAN WITH MY CONDITIONS. (GUNSHOT) (JOHANN) THAT’S HOW I NEGOTIATE. TAKE IT EASY, EVERYBODY. (LANG) THEY ARE GOING INTO THE CAVE, LET’S MOVE. LIEUTENANT, WHAT DO WE GOT? IT’S AN OLD GOLDMINE, CAPTAIN. I GUESS THERE IS AN AIR SHAFT NEARBY. YOU THINK, YOU GUESS. STELLAR INTEL, HONEY. JUST FABULOUS. COME ON, LAY OFF. NOBODY CAN KNOW EVERYTHING. KNOCK IT OFF EVERYBODY. STAY FOCUSED. BASE. NASH HEADED INTO A CAVE. WERE GOING IN AFTER HIM. ROGER. GOOD LUCK CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN? THE SHAFT DUMPS INTO THE TUNNEL. NO SIGN OF NASH AND COMPANY. CAPTAIN, I’VE GOT THEIR TRAIL. SNIPER, 12 O’CLOCK HIGH. MOVE IT OUT. YES, CAPTAIN? HUTCH? CAN YOU HANDLE IT? THAT’S A ROGER. CLEAR. MCKINNEY. LIEUTENANT, DO YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK THIS THING? YES. GOOD. KALLA! WITHDRAW. HUTCH. HUTCH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT MAN? DOC, MY LEG. WHICH ONE? MY LEFT LEG, DOC. WATCH THAT LEFT LEG. KEEP THE LEFT LEG STRAIGHT. NOW WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO DO? ALL RIGHT, HANG IN THERE. I GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE THAT WILL TAKE THE PAIN AWAY. LIEUTENANT! THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OUT, CAPTAIN. BUT IT WON’T BE EASY. WON’T BE EASY FOR WHO? YOU? YOU’RE WELCOME TO STAY BEHIND IF YOU CAN’T CUT IT, SWEETHEART. DOC? HE’S GOING TO BE OKAY, CAPTAIN. A LITTLE MORPHINE AND HE’LL BE SINGING LIKE AN ANGEL. IS DELTA OUT OF THE PICTURE OR NOT? MOMENTARILY, YES. BUT I’M SURE BY TOMORROW MORNING-- I SAY WE DELIVER A BOMB RIGHT UP NASH’ ASS WHILE HE IS ON THE RUN. NASH IS NOT GOING TO MAKE HIMSELF AN EASY TARGET. WE’VE PROJECTED HIS MOST LIKELY ROUTE. AND FOR THE NEXT 2 1/2 HOURS, THE TERRAIN WORKS IN HIS FAVOR AND NOT OURS. ANYMORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE MINE? WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR DETAILS. ADMIRAL, DELTA SIGNAL IS CLEAR. SKIP, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED IN THERE? NASH AND DID HIS BEST TO TRAP US ON THE LOWER LEVEL, SIR. ARE WE STILL IN THE GAME? ARE YOU STILL UP FOR IT? YES SIR, WE ARE. WE NEED A PICKUP FOR HUTCH. BUT EVERYBODY HERE IS WILLING AND ABLE. AND WE WILL NEED SOME WHEELS, SIR. GOOD GOING, CAPTAIN. JUST HOLD YOUR PRESENT POSITION. I’M PRETTY SURE YOU STILL GOT SOME BAD GUYS OUT THERE YOU’VE GOT TO NAIL. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, YONKER. YEAH, I WILL. I MEAN, SOMEONE WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK ON YOUR FEET. I’LL HOLD YOU TO THAT. IT’S BEEN NICE WORKING WITH YOU. HEY, IT’S NOT OVER YET. PLENTY OF FUN AND GAMES TO COME. YOUR RIDE IS HERE, SERGEANT. HEY, LOOK AT THAT, HUTCH. YOUR VERY OWN HERD. I WISH. FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY, BUDDY. OKAY HUTCH. IT’S TIME TO MOVE. REMEMBER TO SAVE SOME ROOM ON YOUR CAST FOR AN AUTOGRAPH. KEEP THAT, DOC. LETS GO, BIG GUY. DO ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU MAC? LIGHTEN UP ON YONKER. I’LL THINK ABOUT IT. HEY MAC, DO YOU DRIVE STICK? IF I WERE YOU, KID I WOULD SHUT UP AND HANG ON. CAPTAIN, NASH AND HIS MEN HAVE JUST ENTERED GENERAL HORDJIKS TERRITORY. HE IS ON THE CIA HIT LIST OF ONE OF MOZAMBIQUE’S MOST NOTORIOUS WARLORDS. PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION. I’LL KEEP YOU POSTED. ACKNOWLEDGED, SIR. CAPTAIN NASH AND HIS MEN ROARED INTO KABONGO AND HERDED EVERYONE INTO THE CHURCH THERE. WHAT THE HELL FOR? YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE, SKIP. JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE VIALS. ACKNOWLEDGED. NASH! YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME OUT. WE KNOW YOU ARE IN THERE. OH (BLEEP)! EXCELLENT SUGGESTION, CAPTAIN. WHY WASTE SUCH A LOVELY AFTERNOON INDOORS. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WE ARE GOING TO GET THOSE VIALS. I THINK NOT. BUT I LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE. PERSISTENCE, TENACITY. VERY NOBLE QUALITIES IN A MAN, CAPTAIN. EVEN THOUGH YOURS HAS BEEN A THORN IN MY SIDE I CAN ALMOST RESPECT YOU FOR IT. YOUR CHOICE OF PERSONNEL IS ANOTHER MATTER ENTIRELY. GOOD THING YOUR KAFFIR KNOWS HIS PLACE. (BLEEP) TOO BAD HE WON’T BE ALIVE TO SEE HIS PEOPLE CLEANSED OF HIS BRETHEREN. WELL, AS YOU UNDOUBTEDLY ALREADY KNOW, I WAS EDUCATED IN YOUR COUNTRY, MAN. SO I UNDERSTAND THE MENTALITY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU KNOW NOTHING OF OURS. NOTHING. WITH YOUR TYPICAL AMERICAN ARROGANCE, YOU THINK YOU CAN STICK YOUR NOSE IN ANYWHERE. NOT HERE, YANK. NOT HERE. ONLY WE KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY. WE RESENT THE KAFFIR FOR THE PHYSICAL OBSTACLE HE POSES. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, YOU BLEEDING HEART ARE THE TRUE ENEMY HERE. YOU DISGRACE YOUR HERITAGE. NO, YOU ARE THE DISGRACE. IT’S VERY FITTING THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET, CAPTAIN. NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME. WE ARE LATE FOR OUR APPOINTMENT WITH DESTINY. SO I WILL LEAVE YOU IN THE VERY CAPABLE HANDS OF GENERAL HORDJIKS MEN. FAREWELL, CAPTAIN. I HAVE ENJOYED THE GAME. HORDJIK! NOW. COVER ME. BOWERS, NOW! HANG ON BUDDY. I’VE GOT TO MOVE HERE. CALM DOWN. IT IS GOING TO BE FINE. IT’S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. WAIT! COME ON. COME ON NOW! COME ON. HURRY. COME ON. WATCH IT. LET’S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. HE’S PRETTY BAD, CAPTAIN. WE’VE GOT TO STOP. ALL RIGHT, STAY WITH US. ALL RIGHT? YOU’RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE. LOOK AT ME. STAY HERE. STAY WITH US. I’M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. BOWERS! DAMN! CAPTAIN. I’M SORRY. LET’S MOVE OUT. COME ON, CAPTAIN. LET’S MOVE OUT, SERGEANT. COULD WE AT LEAST HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE. ALL RIGHT. WHAT’S YOUR POSITION? AT THE RIVER AND TAKING THE BOAT. I THINK I’VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU, ADMIRAL. JUST OFF CHINDE. IT’S GOT THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF A COMMERCIAL VESSEL BUT IT’S PACKING SOME SERIOUS TRANSMITTING POWER IN THE MILITARY BAND WAVES. AND SIR, THEY ARE SPEAKING IN AFRIKANS. I’LL PUT IT ON SPEAKER. CAPTAIN, WE’VE JUST INTERCEPTED AN A.F.A. TRANSMISSION. NASH IS TAKING THE ZAMBEZI TO MEET PRETORIUS AT CHINDE. THERE’S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DROP YOUR BOATS, SO YOU’LL HAVE TO INTERCEPT DOWNRIVER. JACK FIND A BRIDGE YOU CAN USE. YOU KNOW THE DRILL. WE CAN HANDLE IT, SIR. LET’S DO IT. SHOOT! GET DOWN! I HAVE LOST CONTROL, HANG ON! DOC, BACK. WERE GROUNDED, CAPTAIN. NO CASUALTIES. GIVE ME THE FREAKING VIALS. GET ME AND HENSHAW. IT’S THE VIRUS. YOU ARE ONLINE. ADMIRAL, WE HAVE SECURED THE VIRUS. (CHEERS) NASH IS STILL ON THE RUN. GOOD GOING, CAPTAIN. JUST HOLD YOUR PRESENT POSITION. BUT THEY STILL GOT THE ANTI-SERUM. THERE IS NO WAY THAT DELTA CAN CATCH NASH BEFORE HE REACHES PRETORIUS. SO, DO WE GO AFTER THE ANTI-SERUM? WE CAN JUSTIFY AN ATTACK ON A PANAMANIAN CARGO VESSEL. PANAMANIAN CARGO VESSEL, MY ASS. NEVER MIND YOUR ASS. IT CAN BE A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. WE’VE MANAGED TO KEEP THE LID ON THIS FIASCO SO FAR. NOW THAT THE REAL DANGER IS OVER, I SEE NO REASON TO RISK EXPOSURE. ADMIRAL, CONGRATULATE YOUR BOYS AND BRING THEM ON HOME. WHY DON’T YOU CONGRATULATE THEM YOURSELF, PAT? CAPTAIN, I’VE GOT PAT SUNLAND ON VIDLINK FOR YOU. WE ARE RECEIVING, SIR. CAPTAIN LANG, YOUR COUNTRY IS FOREVER INDEBTED TO YOU AND YOUR FALLEN COMPATRIOTS FOR DEFUSING THIS POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE. NO ONE DOUBTS YOUR ABILITY OR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO RETRIEVE THE ANTI-SERUM. IT’S JUST THAT, POLITICALLY SPEAKING, IT’S NOT FEASIBLE. CAPTAIN. YOU HEARD THE MAN, WE ARE DONE HERE. I (BLEEP) HATE POLITICS. THE NATION STATE IS AT HAND. YES. THE VIRUS IS MISSING. THE CASE MUST HAVE FALLEN INTO THE RIVER, SIR. I DIDN’T REALIZE. (MUSIC) (CRYING) DOCTOR, WE HAVE ANOTHER FATALITY. ON THE SCENE IN KABONGO, IS ROLAND. ROLAND, WHAT’S GOING ON? IT’S ABSOLUTE CHAOS HERE, OUTSIDE OF KABONGO. ALTHOUGH THE MILITARY HAS JUST IMPOSED A STRICT QUARANTINE AND A SPOKESMAN HAS REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHAT’S GOING ON, WE WERE ABLE TO GET A CAMERA INSIDE THE VILLAGE EARLIER IN THE DAY. I WARN YOU, THIS IS PRETTY BLEAK FOOTAGE. ANY IDEA WHAT’S AILING THESE PEOPLE? LIKE I SAID WARREN, NOBODY’S SAYING ANYTHING. A FEW MONTHS AGO I WAS COVERING THE EBOLA OUTBREAK, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC FEVER. THEY GOT THE TELLTALE SIGNS. TOLD THAT THE ESTEEMED BELGIAN NEUROLOGIST PASCAL IS ON THE LINE. DOCTOR, CAN YOU HEAR ME? I HEAR YOU. HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEO FOOTAGE, DOCTOR? YES, I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MR. NORTH. EBOLA INDUCED HEMORRHAGIC FEVER SEEMS TO BE INDICATED HERE. IF THERE INDEED HAS BEEN AN OUTBREAK OF EBOLA, WHAT SHOULD THE NEXT STEP BE, DOCTOR? I UNDERSTAND THE MILITARY HAS ALREADY IMPOSED A STRICT QUARANTINE ON THE AREA. BEYOND THAT, IT’S DIFFICULT TO SAY WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT STRAIN OF THE VIRUS IS BEHIND THE OUTBREAK. IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF IT SPREADING NOW THAT THE QUARANTINE IS IN PLACE? UNLIKELY, SINCE EVEN THE MOST VIRULENT STRAINS OF EBOLA CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED BY INCIDENTAL CONTACT. THAT’S GOOD NEWS FOR US, BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE OF KABONGO. GENTLEMEN, I GOT SOME BAD NEWS. THERE HAS BEEN AN OUTBREAK IN KABONGO. SOMEHOW THE VIAL MUST HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. CAPTAIN, YOU MIGHT WANT TO HEAR THIS. THEY PUT KABONGO UNDER STRICT QUARANTINE? RESIDENTS WITHIN A 20 MILE RADIUS ARE REQUIRED TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES. WHAT FOR, MAJOR? AN OUTBREAK? NO, NO. THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE. AND NOT THIS ONE, NOT THE ZAIRE STRAIN. THIS CAN’T BE THE ZAIRE STRAIN. CAPTAIN, WE’VE GOT TO GO AFTER THE ANTI-SERUM. WE HAVE OUR ORDERS, MAJOR. LOOK, KNOWN CASES OF EBOLA DON’T WORK THIS FAST. EVEN ZAIRE CAN’T BE TRANSMITTED BY AIR OR CASUAL PERSON-TO-PERSON CONTACT, BUT THIS ONE CAN. IT’S THE ONLY WAY THE VIRUS COULD HAVE WORKED AS FAST. TELL ME THAT CASE IS BULLETPROOF. IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE. THIS MUST HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE NASH GOT TO THE VILLAGE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING? WELL I-- I WOULDN’T WANT TO GUESS WITHOUT AH-- LOOKING AT THE VIAL. CAPTAIN, THE CODE. PLEASE. IT’S WET. IT COULD BE WATER, IT’S TOUGH TO SAY. MAJOR. UMM... I CAN’T TELL IF IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH, BUT-- THERE IS A CRACK IN THE VIAL. A.B. AIRBORNE, OF COURSE. DR. WELLS MUST HAVE ENGINEERED A SUPER STRAIN THAT NEEDS NO INCUBATION TIME. THAT IS AS EASILY COMMUNICABLE AS A COMMON COLD. WHY THE HELL WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT? I CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE REASON. IT WOULD MAKE ONE HELL OF A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON. IT’S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE CONTAINMENT. THIS IS A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION GENTLEMEN. IF WE ACT, WE LOSE AND WE LOSE BIG. BUT IF WE DO NOTHING, SIT BACK AND PLAY DUMB, WE LOSE CATASTROPHICALLY. HUNDRED CASES REPORTED SO FAR. THAT’S WHY WE ACT NOW. THE MORE TIME WE WASTE MESSING AROUND, THE GREATER THE CHANCE IT WILL OUTRUN US. IF IT GETS OFF THE CONTINENT-- WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU PEOPLE THINKING, WEST? DIDN’T YOU CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION? OBVIOUSLY, WE WOULD HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED EMPLOYING EBOLA A.B. UNTIL THERE WERE SUFFICIENT ANTI-SERUM RESERVES TO CONTAIN ANY ACCIDENTAL SPREAD. LET’S GO AFTER THE ANTI-SERUM. DELTA IS MORE THAN CAPABLE. NEVER MIND DELTA. THE CARRIER GROUP IS STANDING BY NOW. THERE’S NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT. WE CAN’T EVEN BE SURE THE A.F.A. STILL HAS IT. YES, MR. PRESIDENT? YES, SIR. GENTLEMEN, ISSUE THE ORDER. WHAT ABOUT DELTA? THEY ARE RIGHT THERE IN THE HOT ZONE. I’M SORRY, NORM. WE CAN’T TAKE THE CHANCE. HOW THE (BLEEP) ARE THEY GOING TO CONTAIN THIS? LOOK, WITHOUT THE ANTI-SERUM, HIGH HEAT INCINERATION IS THE ONLY WAY. WHAT? THEY ARE GOING TO FIREBOMB KABONGO. WHAT, ALL THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE. MAN, THIS IS BULL (BLEEP). IT’S NOT BULL (BLEEP) SERGEANT. LISTEN, THEY’VE GOT NO CHOICE. CAN’T YOU SEE THAT? THEY’VE GOT NO CHOICE. IT WOULD BE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF ORDERS TO TURN BACK, SO I’M NOT GOING TO ASK ANYBODY TO GO. YOU DON’T HAVE TO ASK, CAPTAIN. I AM IN. OKAY, MAJOR. LET’S GO GET YOUR ANTI-SERUM. GOOD. ESPECIALLY SINCE I’M GOING TO NEED IT. WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT? I’M INFECTED. ARE YOU SURE? IT’S MY AREA OF EXPERTISE, DOC. WELL LET ME GUESS, MAJOR. IF YOU’RE INFECTED, THAT MEANS WERE ALL INFECTED. GIVEN THE CLOSE QUARTERS, ALL THE CONTACT WE’VE HAD WITH EACH OTHER, I WOULDN’T BE A BIT SURPRISED. YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING. LOOK, I FELT A LITTLE OFF. I DIDN’T THINK EBOLA INFECTION. NOT UNTIL I SAW THE CRACK IN THE VIAL. I JUST HAD A BABY GIRL, MAJOR. THIS IS REALLY RICH. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT’S RICH? IF WE HADN’T AGREED TO GO BACK. IT’S NOT THE INFECTION THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED US. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? BASE KNOWS, WE ARE RIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOT ZONE. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. THEY’VE ALREADY MADE PLANS TO TAKE US OUT, CAPTAIN. THEY CAN QUARANTINE US. NO. TOO BIG A RISK. BESIDES, WE WOULD BE DEAD BEFORE MORE ANTI-SERUM COULD BE SYNTHESIZED. THE ADMIRAL WOULD NEVER GO FOR THIS. IT’S NOT THE ADMIRAL'S CHOICE. MCKINNEY, PREP THE GEAR. I’LL FIND OUT WHERE THAT SHIP IS. THERE’S GOT TO BE ANOTHER WAY. DON’T YOU THINK I TRIED? SORRY, JACK. I’M SORRY. THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS DECISION. ROONEY IS ISSUING THE ORDERS NOW. EXCUSE ME, ADMIRAL. IT’S DELTA, SIR. WHAT ABOUT DELTA? THE RADAR SHOWS THEY’VE CHANGED COURSE. THEY ARE HEADING FOR MACHANGA. TRY TO RAISE LANG, QUICKLY. YES, SIR. CAPTAIN, THE ADMIRAL IS TRYING TO RAISE YOU. SHOULD I PATCH HIM THROUGH? WHY? IT’S NOT LIKE HE'S GOING TO CONVINCE US TO ABORT. YOU DON’T KNOW HENSHAW, MAJOR. HE WOULDN’T TRY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. PATCH HIM THROUGH. CAPTAIN, STORMY WEATHER HAS FORCED PRETORIUS AND NASH INTO MACHANGA BAY. YES, SIR. DON’T WASTE TIME TALKING TO ME. GODSPEED DELTA. THANK YOU. ARE YOU READY, MAJOR? YOU BET. WHAT THE (BLEEP) IS GOING ON? I’LL TAKE THIS. LETS GO. NASH. WHERE’S THE VIAL? DON’T SHOOT, HE'S GOT THE VIAL. CAPTAIN, I GOT IT. NOT SO FAST, KAFFIR. HANDS IN THE AIR. NOW! OR SHE DIES. SHOOT HIM! YOU-- SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP. DROP THEM. PERSISTENCE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH TO OVERCOME A SUPERIOR ADVERSARY, CAPTAIN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU DON’T HAVE THE VIRUS ANYMORE. DON’T I. WE TOO LEARNED OF THE NEWS OF THE OUTBREAK IN KABONGO. MY GOD. YOU ARE INFECTED. AND YOU ARE USING YOURSELF AS A CARRIER TO TRANSMIT THE DISEASE. SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE INTERRUPTED BY AN INSOLENT KAFFIR. I’VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF THAT KAFFIR (BLEEP). A PLANE. A PLANE. THANK GOD, IT’S THE ANTI-SERUM. WHERE IS YOUR CHIEF DOCTOR? COME THIS WAY, PLEASE. IT REALLY WASN’T YOUR FAULT, WAS IT, MAJOR? THERE IS HARDLY A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT I DON’T WONDER IF THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENT. MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE CHANGED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. BUT THERE WASN’T. I’M SURE YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. THERE'S SOME SERIOUS BELLY THERE ON THE DOCK WITH NASH. ACTUALLY, THAT WAS ALL HEART. WELL, IF YOU EVER GET TIRED OF PEERING INTO THAT MICROSCOPE MAJOR, I’D BE HAPPY TO PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR YOU WITH ADMIRAL HENSHAW. THANKS, CAPTAIN. I’LL KEEP THAT IN MIND. I SAY WE MAKE THE MAJOR AN HONORARY MEMBER OF DELTA. I WILL SECOND THAT, CAPTAIN. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. WELCOME ABOARD, MAJOR. WELCOME ABOARD. CONGRATULATIONS, MAJOR. YOU MEAN THAT I GET TO ORDER YOU GUYS AROUND NOW? NO WAY. NOT A CHANCE OF THAT, SIR. WELL, IT WAS WORTH A TRY. YEAH, RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
