What is left for me here? I'm leaving to Malaysia next week. Okay, what's the plan for the house? I think of settling down in Malaysia itself. No intent of returning to India again.

"A new day greets ..." "Bright and radiant" "Family brings us warmth..." "A wonderful blessing it is!" Sister! Dad. Don't know how mom is doing with brother. At least, you can call him and check about her? We didn't ask her to leave. She wished to be with her son and left. Your brother will take care of everything. No, dad. I think you were bit hasty regarding brother. No, dear. I thought twice before taking the decision. - But, you didn't even call... - Grandpa! What, dear? Suddenly, I've got a special power. When I clap, the door opens, on it's own. Is it? Clap now, let's see. Special powers? Go... go and study. Dad, do you need anything else? No. That's my toy! Lord Anjaneya! Lord Anjaneya! That's my toy! Sister! Nivedha! Nivedha! Hey, what are you doing here? Come. What happened? A boy came and tried to grab my toy. A boy? Which boy? Nowadays, you've become more naughtier. It's true, sister. A plumpy boy came. You are bored and you are playing with me. Go and play with grandpa. Nivedha! Nivedha! Santhanam! What happened, ma'am? Nivedha was right. Someone is in this house. Something's there. Don't be scared, Meera ma'am. Let's see what it is. Grandpa, you've to clap thrice after you hide, okay? Come. Grandpa, are you ready? One...two...three... Grandpa! Grandpa! Gotcha! Grandpa, here I come! Grandpa, here I'm! - Grandpa! - What happened, dear? Nivedha! - Nivedha! what happened? - Don't know, she got scared. Nivedha, what happened? What happened? Grandpa, I'm scared. Do Ghosts really exist? There is no such thing. Then, who are they? Don't know. You don't be afraid. God will take care of them. When will God come here? Hey, come. - Sir! -Come on I say. Don't overact. Where is the ghost? - Call it, let's see. - Sir! Hey, what? Are you trying to scare us saying the ghost is here? I swear on my mother. Ghost exists, here. I stand witness to it. Don't bluff! Hey, we both are here. But, it's not visible to us. Trust me, this place is haunted. I saw it. Mr. Sundar's family and myself came here, a while ago. Come in, sir. Get in. Sir, this is the hall. That's the kitchen. There are two large rooms. And two bedrooms upstairs. Come, let's see. That's my toy. That's my toy. That's my toy. The goods should reach in two days. Else, I'll not spare any of you. - Dad! - What? There is a ghost in that room. Hey, what are you blabbering? Go play downstairs! Go. Oh, no! Hey, I've come to checkout a house for buying. Hey, Ganapathy! I asked you to show me a house and you are showing me a graveyard. A ghost exists here. You just stay here and die. I'm going. Sir! Grandpa, here I'm! Sir! - I swear on you... on you... - Hey. Sorry, sir. I swear on me... The ghost is playing hide and seek, here. Narrating ghost tales to me? Get lost! Ask Sundar sir. Ask him right now. I could not ascertain truthfulness in what he says. But, what you do is... Take it. You must tell everyone exactly what you've seen here. The whole town should believe there is ghost in this house. None should dare to enter this house. Why sir? Don't question me. If you tell people that we asked you to do so... I'll slit your throat. Scoot! - Dad! - Sir! - Dad! - Grandpa! Grandpa! Guru, let's exploit his urgency. Let's say, no one is buying a ghost house... ...and we will sell it for low cost. Good plan! If we demolish this house and build a commercial complex here, Will see lots of money. Let's take equal share in the profit. - Deal? - Deal. Sister, are we dead? Are we ghosts, really? Sir, what's this? Are we dead? When and how did we die? Dad, I want to see mom. Meera, we're dead. We don't have any relations. We have moved away too far from her. I don't agree, dad! Death doesn't end our relationships. I want to see mom. Till then, they won't allow us to stay. They know that we're merely ghosts. They'll chase us away by some means. Come whatever... We've to stay here for mom. Whoever comes between this, we'll chase them away. How can we, ma'am? Our fear died along with us. But humans fear. That’s enough to chase them away. 'Fear', that’s our weapon. Dad loved this car. Yeah, I know. He never allowed us even to touch it. Sir...! Sir...! Get the key first. What happened? There is ghost in this house. I can’t sell this house. Hey! what do you mean? - Is there ghost in this house? - Yes, sir! I stand a witness for that. Are you hoaxing to reduce the cost of the house? If I want to buy this house, I'll bargain and finalize it. I won't lie. My humble request... 'Please let me go'. Hey, Ganapathy! What is he blabbering? Ignore him. Who heeds his words? He is a small middleman. I know a builder named Guru. Let's talk to him. Will he buy it? He says that ghosts exist here. He'll buy properties irrespective of encumbrances involved. He is a big shot managing multiple ventures. Let's talk to Guru, this evening. You are here? - Greetings, bro! - Greetings, - Go and sit. - Okay, bro. For quite some days, serpents haunt me in dreams. People say it's sign of getting married. Rather get bitten by a serpent. You nailed it! What a glow in sir’s face! - Yes. - Thank you. Sir, are you a first time drinker? Shall I tutor you to open the bottle? Sir, don't get scared. My name is 'Tasmac' Douglas. What's the name? 'Tasmac' Douglas. Not a big deal, sir. Take the bottle, tap twice on top and bottom... ...and open, smoothly. Start the vehicle! What did you guys tell? Hey! wait. let me talk... Explain them! Look, he is like an election candidate before boozing. Once done, he'll create a ruckus like a victorious M.L.A. Then, you'll lose the deposit. Look before you leap. Is that clear? - Sorry, sir! - Scoot. Is this egg yours? 'My life is in a bottle' Boss, what are you doing? Why? I'm checking the accounts. As he's watching cricket with the book, he must be a bookie. Look, that batsman will hit sixer in a single shot. Want to test my prediction? Hey, that's a sixer! I bid a ditto shot in the next ball. Wanna challenge? The bowler'll bowl a similar ball and the batsman is going to hit six. Bet? Dear, please leave. One single bet! Double money! Free hit. Go mind your business. Leave. Oblige the boss. I'll. You go home with the money. I know that. Get lost. Here comes the shot! Sixer! Hey, bowled! Clean bowled. Hey, that's a re-telecast. Re-telecast match? Hey, are you betting on the past match? Give me the money back. - Hey... - Give me my money back. - Hey.... - Give it back, else... - Thangam. - Move aside, who are you? Hey, who are you guys? Give my money back, else you will face the consequences... Boss, he gambled as he was high! Pity on him. How dare to pass me the orders? Get on with your work. - Boss... I meant... - Move! Let's wrap it up for 10 millions 10 million? The house is worth 50 millions! Trust me. 10 million is exaggerated amount for a haunted house. Do you really mean it, sir? Do you still believe in ghosts and devils? - Senthil, go and check that table. - Will check, sir! Saravanan sir, even if the best surgeon performs a surgery… …we'll pray to God! God is a belief. Humans are real. We believe in God than humans. Belief fares better than truth. Guru, 10 million is damn low price. Not sure if it's worth 10 million. But, that’s final. I'll pay the whole amount as cash. Give it a deep thought, call me if you are fine with it. You want to go to Malaysia in a week? What's your plan? Okay, try your best and finalize it at a better price. Don’t get tensed! I'll try my best. Sir! - Enough! - Not this, sir! I overheard your conversation. If you don’t mind, Can I tell you something? Tell me! I've a good notion to sell your house at a better price. People are skeptical about buying, presuming it to be haunted. What are you going to do? That’s the catch, sir. We can prove there is no ghost. Tell me. If we manage the stay of four people, If they come back safely, Everyone will believe there is no ghost. Who will dare to stay there? You need not worry about it, sir. People are ready to stay in a graveyard, provided we pay them. Then, you can sell the house at a good price. Okay. Sir, my commission? I'll see to it. Thank you, sir. - I'll talk to them, right now. - Okay. Look at the house! It looks like a haunted bungalow. Will there be any ghosts? Doesn't matter. What? Aren't you scared of ghosts? I used to get scared in my childhood... Then? When I fell in love with a girl, I lost half the fear... ...and when I married her, I totally forgot it. Irrespective of it's presence... we shall stay here for four days... ...as senthil said and get a hefty amount. Fine? Come on. Oh! Superb! Hey, jolly! I'm going to see the ghost. Ghost... Hey, why did you bring this media guy? I told him, we're going to a ghost house. So, he invited himself to click photos of the ghosts... These people barge in with cameras to all the places except restrooms. Hey, why did you take my photo? Brother, you are cute as a ghost. I'll sell your photo to the channel instead of ghost’s photo... ...if I don’t get one. Hey! you're talking too much. - Go away. - Brother, just one photo. - Hey, move away. - Brother! Are you a dummy? I'll punch you. Come, let’s take a photo. That’s my toy. The toy is mine! Hey! Chitti 3.0... Who are you, sir? So handsome? Bye. "The demons are diverse. The spirits are individualistic." "Is there any ghost here?" "Can I get a glimpse of it?" "There are no ghosts." Muthu brother? Are you dead? You taught me never to exhibit fear in eyes But, you've closed your eyes for ever... Kumar brother? Kumar brother? Kumar brother? Is anyone here? I'm feeling scared... Lord Ayyappa, please save me! Almighty Allah, please save me! Jesus Christ, save me! Muthu brother? This is our house... Chief, I made the mistake when I was high! - Brother. - Have coffee! Give me... - Have it. - That is... Mom... Greetings! Mom.. just now you gave tablets, right? Anu… Take her. - Come, mom...! - Go… Take her. - Come, mom...! - Go… - Come, mom...! -Go… Mom is suffering with amnesia... She forgets everything... ...and she repeats everything. Okay, continue from where you left... That's the money for my son’s surgery. My wife left to her mother’s place as I lost the money... Oh, goodness! You please talk and get my money back, chief! The money which we've given to Guru is like an offering to temple's collection box. We can’t get it back. Let's think of some alternative. Brother! My son’s life is in your hands! First, this drunkard spoiled my life. Now, he spoiled my child's life too... Look at this child face. Somehow, arrange money for us, brother... I'm begging for my child’s life. You're talking too sentimentally. Wait, let me see. I had never helped my own sister... - Brother, my problem is... - Stop. Wait...your wife rendered your dialogues... I'm helping only for her sake.. - Apparently a big deal will be wrapped... - Chief! I said 'apparently'. The deal is not closed. Muthuswamy. Muthuswamy. Manohar. I think they're sleeping, sir. Move aside. Hey, Manohar! - Don't talk anything, brother. - What happened? I can’t hear. - What? - I can’t hear, brother. - Hey, Manohar! - Stop. - Who is that? - He's our guy, sir... He is hyper active. Oh, God! Muthuswamy! - Muthuswamy! - Check what happened? Vetri. - Thank God! - What? Sir, he is alive... Hey, you won’t be alive if he dies. You said as three people.. where is the another one? I don’t know, sir. Who is responsible if anything happens to these people? I'm responsible, sir. Saravana, he isn't right for this. Let's seek Guru to get it done. -Sir! Give me one last chance, sir. Loot at the state of these guys.... Forget about them. I'll stay in this house and prove that no ghost is here.. One final chance, sir. - Look! This is your last chance... - Okay, sir. If you prove that there is no ghost here... I'll give you 10% commission of this house’s selling price... Thank you, sir. Come on... Take care of him. I'll take care, sir. I guessed they will get wasted when they demanded a hefty advance. Muthuswamy! Muthuswamy! Kumar! Kumar! Hey, Kumar! Where are you? Hey, Kumar! Chief! Oh gosh! Why? What happened, chief? This is uncalled for considering your health. Even a sneeze or cough could put your life in danger. Just a clink of tumbler gives you jitters. Had God warranted a doctor... ...to let person live or kill I'd have killed this imbecile long before. Passion, doctor. To hell with your passion! How is your bowel movements? It's normal. What happened, doctor? He attempted suicide by poisoning himself. Oh no! He had mixed four drops of poison in high proportion of sweet. The poison failed. But, the high sweet intake did the job. Dysentry for three straight days. If you truly want to die... No need to pay the fee. Just let me know. I'll do the needful. - Everything is normal. - Thank you, doctor. In case of emergency, take the pills I prescribed. Thank you, doctor. Guess he is ashamed! Brother, why did you decide to die? Passion, sir. A musical line from the film, "Muthu" 'I'm perplexed' 'I pity you' 'Kiss me back' 'What did you say?' 'Asked you to kiss.' A musical line from the film, "Muthu" 'Tell me, what did you do to my boss?' 'You killed him.' 'Why did you kill my son?' 'Why are you panicking?' No. Don't turn. Don't turn...stand there with same expression.

Do you need this, too? What to do with this? - Get lost. - Sir, Sir, at least he has a knife. I don't even have that. I don't need hefty amount. Just 0.7 million is enough, I'll come along. Everyone is asking for a share. Is he running share market business? Don't hesitate, sir. Even 5 lakh rupees will do. You said five and showing four fingers. What about the other finger? Mr. Security guard, is the air conditioner working? The air conditioner is not effective. Get the air conditioner checked. If this heist gets exposed, the bank will cancel our agency's contract. So, without a fuss we have replaced the money. You must help us recover the money from him. Nanda, is that an ATM or public toilet? You charge them for their entry? If this gets leaked, flinging partners will flood the ATMS Let me watch the second half. Oh no! Good! You could have done one more thing. Tell me, sir. You could've booked and escorted them in a cab They'd have gone cool. But, I guess you are good at playing flutes. Thank you, sir. - Will you play a song for me? - Definitely, sir. Play now. You played it, excellently. Really, you're a good artist. We are not pressing charges on you. Now, we're friends. Better, give him the money in a week. Okay, sir. I have got no money, sir. No money? Yes, sir. Really? I swear... So, you can't pay him the money? I can't. Enough! I can't take up this melancholy anymore. Look here, if you guys stay with me for three days... ...in a house, I'll give a million for each of you. You can set up your parlor and I can take care of my son's surgery. Why is he still crying? Noticed his ear? He is audibly challenged. Hey, look here. - At least three lakhs? - Not three lakhs... If you come along, we'll give you ten lakhs. - Ten... - Fix it in the ear. Ten lakhs!

You want me to wait? She has come! Who came and where? Why is he rapping? I know, you're here. Appear here. Your brother has come in search of you. Brother! Hey, go! He is doing mimicry, chief. It shouldn't be scaring us. Hey, move away. What's this Senthil? We've just arrived. Don't know, sir. - Sir... -Who are you? - My sister's spirit, sir. -What's she doing here? I'll hit you. Get out. What's this, Vetri? Won't you listen? Get out. Get up. - Go out. - Sir... Go out. It's not a spirit but ghost. It'll avenge you. You will be dead before dawn. What's this? Ask me. You didn't believe when Guru said. But here, the guys whom you've sent became lunatic. Don't know whether the other one is dead or alive? What? Alive or dead? Does ghost exist here? No... Under what pretext have you brought them here? Is this a picnic spot? Who is responsible if these people die? Vetri, leave him. - Look here... - Sir! First, prove there is no ghost in this house. Not 10%, I'll pay you 20% commission. Thank you, sir. I'll come in the morning. It's fine if I can find you here. Else, I'll finalize the matter with Guru. We'll be here for sure. You can leave. Come on. Come. Have they unraveled it? What's this, sir? Did you hear what he said? He will play 20% commission. He said, he'll give if we're here. Does it mean, if we're alive? Let's be confident. Did he tell us to stay for four years? Just for four days... Come, let's go. Look there, a spacious courtyard, a kitchen and 2 bedrooms upstairs. Let's stay happily. Why are you all looking dull? Senthil sir, I came with you assuming you'll help me... but you've brought me to a haunted house. Believe me! The ghost doesn't exist in this world. How it's possible to be in this house? Chief, you know I believe in God. But, if God comes before me, I'll be frightened. When I can't face God, I'll die if it's a ghost. I can't stay in this house panicking each and every minute. I'm leaving. - Hey, listen to me. - Sir, I'm afraid to commit suicide though I wish to die. How can I stay in a haunted house? Leave me, sir. I'll run away. Fear...Fear... What is fear? You fear that your wife and children might leave you. You fear that you might not become a star. You fear that you'll be branded as a thief. Fear isn't induced... But innate... If a vehicle hits us suddenly, we can't stop it. But, we can overcome the fear, that's innate. Fear of living. Fear of dying. Fear of God. Fear of ghost. Fear of advancing a step. Fear of retreating a step. Feared of everything, Are you going to die without making progress till the end? 'Lead the life with fearlessness and not fearfulness' 'Fearfulness isn't worth a nag' 'Millions have fallen a prey to fear' ''Fear not'- there's still a lot left in you ' I'll overcome this fear. Who is ready to stay with me? I am... Who is ready to die with me? I am... Who will overcome the fear and emerge victorious alongside me? I am... - Hail Magizhmathi! - Hail Magizhmathi! - Are you ready? - Ready. - Shall we go? - Let's go. Come on. Hey, why are you scared? Look at him! He has tucked up his lower and ready like a raging lion. Raging lion? It's a shameful thing to share. I'm just getting ready to retreat, when the ghost shows up. You go forward. For accolades, you let others take the lead? And let me lead for getting bashed. Come on. I'll kill you. One... Two... Three! Hey, Kumar! Got any sense? You're trying to kill? - Why did you bring these people? - These people? The house is haunted! It's dangerous to stay here. Come, let's run away. Who is he? He is our guy. He has boozed all night and is still high. Will this pill help you overcome fear? It has nothing to do with fear, but I'll die, If I don't take this. Don't say so, sir. We've come here trusting you. Why are you on medication? Not so interesting. It's heart problem. Really, sir? That's a long story. Are you going to narrate a flashback, sir? Yes, why? To play the background music. - Are you good at it? - Of course, sir. Okay. Grandma! It's okay. No, a book. Tell her. Grandma, your granddaughter and I are in love. Oh, no! Not her. She is my sister-in-law. I meant your elder granddaughter. Shylu... Shyness. Really? We're waiting to get married with your consent. Already, I got heart attack, twice. If you get married, who will help her get married? If getting married is your only concern, go ahead. What if your sister doesn't get married... ...your brother is jobless It's upto their fate. The ball is in your court. Grandma! Keep your ears open. No matter what happens. Until my sister gets married and my brother gets a job. I'll not get married. I swear on my grandma. She is very affectionate on her siblings! Damn it! Are you angry? No... yes... Happy, now? Sendhu, I need some favors from you. I must find a bridegroom for your sister... ...and a job for your brother, right? Yes. Anything else? Grandma! A good news. What? I have got a job for Mr. Muscle, my brother in law. To graze the camel, why is he building his body? I said 'pass this appointment letter' Let him see. I got your younger granddaughter married. And got a job for your grandson. Can we marry, at least now? What do you say, dear? Grandma, all the obligations are over, isn't it? If getting married will you keep you happy, go ahead. - Grandma, bless me. - Hey, get up. But, did you think of this helpless old granny... ...suffering to fetch a glass of hot water? - Grandma! - Grandma! - Keep your ears open. - Keep your ears open. - Whatever happens... - Whatever happens... We'll not marry until you die. What? I swear on my grandma! Do you love grandma so much? Stay blessed, dear! Put your hands, down. - I must put an end to this promise. - Sorry, forgive me. Enough. Still how long will you kiss in the air? - I'll die before your grandma does. - Senthil! I got your sister married… …and got a job for you brother, And let me kill... I can't wait until she dies. Let's do one thing. Let your grandmother stay with us after our marriage, okay? Yeah, okay. I'll find an auspicious day and arrange for the marriage. Grandma, I got the sample invitation. Have to finalize. Call Shylu. Shylu will not come. She'll come if called. Shylu... Shylu... She went to buy milk will not be back, henceforth. She would've went to buy milk for coffee. She'll come now. No. she went to buy milk... To buy milk? She eloped with the milkman. What are you saying, grandma? Yes, take a look at it. Apple of my eye! I'm sorry. It's my mistake. I fell in love with him. Love is strange. No one can predict our future love... Had I predicted this... ...definitely I wouldn't have left to buy milk. Grandma need not wait for milk and you need not wait for me. Forget me, Senthil. With fluttering... and throbbing heart... Yours sincerely.... Shylaja. Oh, my God! What happened, doctor? There is a big hole in your heart. My love, Shylaja is the reason for it. Break up? If every break up gives a hole in the heart... There will be a minimum of ten holes in every man's heart. This defect has been ever since your birth. It has been identified now. What shall we do about it, doctor? Get ready with 10 bucks. Ten? Where can I get ten thousand rupees? It's not ten thousand? Ten lakhs. - What? - Ten lakhs. - You always ogle at the patients. - In lakhs! Move away. If you fall for every moment, I can't perform a surgery All I can do is postmortem. You want me to die. Doctor, I don't have any rich reserves like you to back me. I'm just a bar tender. I can arrange for twenty five thousand rupees max. Fill a part of the hole with that. Hey, is that a hole in the utensil? I can't do the surgery for the least amount. Somehow, save my life, doctor. I'll give you an idea to save your life. Tell me, doctor. 'Reverse emotional therapy'. Emotional therapy? Which means? What will you do if you're on cloud nine? I'll booze and laugh to the core. No, you shouldn't laugh, hereafter. You must cry. What will you do if you're afraid, suddenly? Th... the panic mode will kick in My body starts trembling and sweats heavily. Right. But, you must laugh when you're afraid. Tell me, now. What will you do when afraid? I must laugh. And when you are happy? I must cry. Very good. If you balance your emotions equally, you'll live for long time. If not? You can go to heaven. Doctor! Nurse, discharge him, immediately. Get a fee of twenty five thousand rupees for giving a notion. Doctor! Reverse emotion. Doctor! Smart boy. Pay the bill without fail. You'll rot in hell. He is done with his narration. We need only money. But for you, the life is at risk. Don't remind me that. Our problems will be solved only if we take risk. Chief, that's okay. But how can we stay in the haunted house? Listen! If we can manage to stay here for four days... we can get rid of our problems. Let's focus just that. It's a cat! 'I didn't commit any offense...' 'I did it...' 'Allow me to go...' 'Let Ambi to go out...' 'Extraordinary performance!' 'Speaking alien language' Hey, turn down the volume. Might become deaf. Look at him, he isn't disturbing anyone. Actress with a number in her name and starred in a film with a numeric title? A question of the hour? It's asked in the crossword puzzle, brother. Actress Trisha in the film '96'. - Great IQ! - Thanks. Feel proud! The capital city of Kerala. Answer this. Karnataka, right? It's Goa. I thought it's Palakkad. Damn it. Chief, what's the time? Is it a medicinal syrup to take it on time? It's okay, tell me the time. Oh, no! Tell the time. - Can't you say it? - I got no time for it. For the clock to strike 9... Hey, wait. Start the vehicle! Shall I leave? Where are you going? What has it got to do with you? Hey chief? Look at the serene guy next to you. Copy him! Copied? 'Give me a firm reply... Are you a human?' 'No... You are a toy' Hey, toy! What are you doing here, alone? Come on. Won't you heed? You're a toy. Me too. Everything are toys. I'll not disturb you, so should you. Okay. Let's sleep, now. But you have to agree to this. You shouldn't snore while sleeping. I hate snoring. What's the sound? Did you hear that? It won't be heard, hereafter. You're gifted. What's the name of the organ in our body... ...in the shape of love? As if he is Crossword Cummings! The heart! Damn it. I forgot to take the pill. Water. Th... thanks. Missed by a whisker! Nanda! Why isn't he afraid? Aah, how good is he! Like lord Krishna played the flute and seduced the gopikas, You play it for the ghosts. Play it. What are they thinking? Won't they get scared? Don't be angry. What to do? You're a beautiful ghost. May be because of that. Meera ma'am, don't worry. I'll go deal those guys. What happened? Hey, is that television or drums? You're banging it. - It's not clear. - So? Hey fatso! You rogue! Why don't you give chance to talented people? People like you are a curse to the nation. Recommendation for everything. That's why, we're struggling in the Oscars and Olympics. What country is this? Sir, don't hit me. Hey, why are you torturing Ambi for my faults? If you're bold enough... Don't shoot me. Shoot me! I swear on Lord! ...That five murders. I didn't commit any crime. ...I did that. Allow me to go out. ...Allow Ambi to go out. Ambi? Who is he? Had you performed it to a director... You might've got a chance. A dialogue from the film, "Baahubali". What language is this? I can't understand anything. Who are you? Oh, it's a transition from arts to spiritual! When there is a creator, there will be a creation. If there's a creation, there will be a creator. I'm telling about the truth of energy. One G...two G...three G... Prem G... It's all coming from energy. I'm simply telling you the universe has... no other choice without following me. When there is me, residing in me... That me... this me... Talking to me. Me plus me is meme. That's why, I'm getting lot of memes. Oh, no! The ghost is dead. Somehow, we've managed. Why are you laughing? You laughed, so I joined you. Why did you come here, now? Go. Don't you feel the urge? No. I'll let you know if I feel it. If you too feel like peeing, let's both go together. Are we going on a date as a couple? Don't you've sense? Go... So you don't feel the urge. How will I? This fear killed the urge. You go... Adding to this... Go this way. Brilliant guy. You don't fit the bill. I'll go and chase them away. 'Singing a movie song' Oh no! he's filling up the pot. Just a minute, Kaali. I'm not Kaali. You wanna pee too, sir? It's clear. It will be... if you peep. What are you doing? Will anyone play carrom in the restroom? You're pissing on the pot. Stop kidding. I'm doing it right, sir. Really? Okay, I'll go. Will you please flush it properly? Hey, I asked you to flush but you're caressing the pillar? No, sir. That might be here. Didn't you go, sir? I won't. What did I tell you and what are you doing? Sir! Hey, stop there. Sir! I'll tell you the truth. Sir, I'm suffering from 'night blindness'. I can't see at night. Really? Forget it, sir. You manage pretty well with this defect. How is the crossword puzzle possible? Just to avoid suspicion. Oh, why did you play the flute? I'll be afraid to be alone at night. That's musical therapy... Damn it. Don't know what this drunkard is doing? But, your life is peaceful. You can't hear at all and can't see anything after the dusk. Divine smile. I'm leaving. Thangam! He is sleeping like a child. Where is the sound coming from? That's my toy! The toy is mine! Oh, no! Little ghost! The toy is mine. Hey, I told you not to disturb me. This isn't your voice. Oh, no! Hey, don't look at there! Don't do it! - Hey, who are you? - The toy is mine. What are you doing under the cot? Come out. If you want a toy, go and ask your mom. That's my toy. What? I'll break your teeth. Look at her... Dressed up like a clown! Get on with your homework. Disturbing me... Thangam, come on. Why are you here, Chief? - Come down. - Downstairs? - I can't do the homework. - No. Not that, to booze. - To booze? - Come. He is calling to booze. 'To be blown to pieces without any direction and to go up in flames...' ...do you think I’m a Diwali rocket? You're rocking! I'm a surface to surface ballistic missile that hits the target with high precision. You doofus! Kali, are you back? I'm Senthil. Senthil? It would be good if Kali and Thangam were here, right? Both are right here - unharmed. Shall we play antakshari? Why songs? We are already in trouble. Everyone is scared to death. Chief, why are you afraid? Why fear in our own house? This house is ours! 'This house is ours' 'This house is ours' Hey, who is that repeating the same like TV news channel? This house is ours! Hey! This house is ours! Run away from this house. Else, you'll die. Hey, we die every night and come alive in the morning. Get lost! You can stay here with no fear of death. But, you will later die of fear. There's something that separtes us from the humans. Do you know what's that? Fear. We don't know what fear is? But, we see it in your eyes. I have been patient enough. You're guys are talking too much. Give it in writing and sign it. We'll go out. Yeah, what's the proof that you're all ghosts? No one expected it, right? Didn't expect me to retaliate? Didn't think that I'll hit you single-handedly, right? I've come to your place. Do whatever you can. Have you started again? A very spacious house. Amazing beauty. You're the King and Queen of this house. But only one drawback. Everyone is in the same attire for many days. Come, let's go to 'Super Stores'. We'll buy clothes for everyone. What do you want? Everything is here. Shall we go? Are you trying to frighten me? You talk of fear... Do you think only you can frighten us? Don't I know how? Shall I bring thousand people from Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts? 10 trains travel to and fro to the city. Shall I bring hundred people per train? Or shall we fight one to one? I'm ready. Come on. It's gone. Let's dance! What? I had a haunting dream. You were reciting filmy dialogues to the ghost at night And now you fear as if it was a dream? Where are the other guys? Did ghosts attack them? You sinner! Look there. He looks so divine. What about Nanda? What are you doing? Arrow practice. You were fumbling in the night... And practicing with the arrows now. Senthil sir, I have sight problems only in the night. But I'm as sharp as a hawk in the daylight. Sharp as a hawk? Really? Let's see. Aim. - How is it? - It might be a fluke. Aim the second dart. Excellent! Throw this too. - Are they here? -Yes sir, they're inside. Come in, sir. We are the ones staying here, sir. - House owner. - I know. Greetings, sir! Don't over act. Character artist. No problem here, right? No problem, sir. We slept well, last night. Last night, actress Trisha appeared in my dreams and sang "Yamunai Aatril" song. Trisha? Sir! I told you yesterday itself to not come here. Get out. Sir, I'll speak to my sister only once. What is he saying? There is no such person. Can't you understand at once? Supernatural powers exist here. First, those souls will warn you. If you still persist, you will face their wrath. It'll destroy each one of you leaving no signs behind. You're going to see it's furiosity. If you don't leave immediately.. I'll call the Commissioner office and will get you nabbed. Sir! Please don't inform the police. Sir, leave it. I'll explain and send him off. Come here. If your sister's spirit is here, I'll send you a word. Go. - Not that... - I'll send you a word. Go... I'll send you a word. Nuisance. Sir. They won't trouble us anymore. Senthil, the deal is about to be finalized with a big shot. It's enough, if you stay here for a couple of days. You won't be afraid, right? Fear? For us. No Sir. You leave without fear. Okay, sir. What Sir? The Sorcerer is blabbering about supernatural powers and stuffs. Forget it. That's nothing. Go... Go.. I said go! Hello! Hey, have you become a big middleman? Looks like you are dealing in lakhs. Nothing like that, chief. I am in urgent need of money. That's why. I'm dealing the house now. Better, back off. Else, none of you will be alive. This is my last warning. What are you saying... There is no one at the shop... Hey! Hey! Damn it. - Hey, can't you finish up the assignment? - Sir, They are too stubborn to believe about ghosts. I played the sentiment card as well Our guy tried his best with his ghost tales. It didn't work. This plan won't work any further. If they stay in that house for two more days... ...the deal will be out of our hands Trusting them won't work anymore. We have to do something on our own. I know what to do. I'll take care. There is only one option left to make them vacate the house, Oh, God! Why are you screaming like this? It's me! You are scared to death. Wonder how'll you frighten people inside. Forget it. I told you to dress up like a ghost, isn't it? But, you have dressed up like a bride. You scared the hell out of me. It's a horror scene with no space for romance. Do you understand? You said, you'll treat me like a Queen. For that, I should be a King. Now, you made me to act as a ghost. Don't worry, Shylu. A rag can't become a rich in few minutes like in movie songs. If we chase away the four inmates... we'll be paid twenty five thousand rupees. Let's go to Kodaikanal. What do you say? Do whatever you want. I'll make them taste the fear of death. Wait and watch. Firstly, you mustn't get scared. Remove the coat. Could have come in usual way instead of this. Shut your mouth and remove the coat. - Have you inserted the battery? - Yes. Start the vehicle. Kali sir, you are so much into movies... Who is the actress whose name starts with 'lai' and ends with 'la'? Hey, she is 'Laila' dude. You have no clue about my Queen? Your brain should be scrapped and disposed to the scrap store. Hey chief, give the match box. Fire. Fire. 'Fire'. It's in the kitchen. Go, get it. Mr. actor. Just watching (actor) Sarath Kumar's songs won't help you. You must dance like him. Oh, no! - Hey, chief. - Power cut. I know. Don't overact. I wanted you guys to be careful. Irking guy. Senthil sir, why did you switch off the fan? I just told you it's a 'power outage'. What? Power outage!? Power 'On' or 'Off' doesn't make a difference to you. Why did you shriek? You've a book as well? - As if you are going to read. - Okay, I'm going to sleep. Get lost. Grandpa, I wish to see grandma. Will she come? She'll come. Wonder, how is she doing now ? She is doing good. I know. Definitely, she'll come. If we want to stay in this house... Somehow we must chase those guys away. We've to make them understand what true fear is. I have checked around ten rooms, yet to spot anyone. They have kept rice bags straight up. Wow! A moon in the face! Star in the eye! Beautiful! Baby face! It's an old face! It's like a Boulder face! So, you too are hired by the inspector? You are too good! I've never seen such an great actor in my industry. No such actor will be born in future as well. Even if someone does, you kill him with your performance. Who is he? Senthil! Shylu! Is he listening to the songs while sleeping? He will not sleep without flute, as if he is Lord Krishna. I'm gonna kill you. Watch out! Oh, no! don't know who it is. Let me hide behind the curtains. Who is that? Senthil sir! Senthil sir! Where did it go? Has he woken up? What is he playing? Mr. Boulder, are you a ghost? The pitch is dropping low. Terrifying the ghost with one's music? He is done with composition and leaving. What? He is going back to bed. You scare the scariest ghosts. If the first one is like this. I wonder how the other three will be. Santhanam, can't you frighten them properly. Go. I am just roaming inside here for two hours. Feeling hungry as well. Where did those guys go? - Hey! - Who is that? Do you've a matchbox? Ask him. Check if he gives you. Hey dude, do you've a matchbox? Oh, no! Hey, did you look at him? He is having fire on his forehead! Whatever it is, don't touch him. Oh, gosh! He has lit it. He is teasing him? Stand near a shop, fire cost can be cut down. Why? Trying to scare me? Bye. It's confusing as to who is ghost or human in this house. Who is feared of whom? Why did you drag me in this? I am coming now. Wait. I met the guy whom I thought I shouldn't ever meet. Shylaja! Oh, no! Where are you running? Wait. Shylu! Yes, I'm a ghost! Yes, I'm a ghost! Sorry, Senthil. God has severely punished me for betraying you. Just within 3 months from our marriage, my husband and I died in an accident. Look, we were residing in the nearby tamarind tree. Sinners! They've cut the tree to lay the road. With no other place to go, we came here, Senthil. Deforestation troubles ghosts too? Shylu, do ghosts cry? This ghost does, Senthil. No! Never! Shylu! You are more beautiful as a ghost than as a human. You too. You look handsome now... Far better than our dating days. Now I'm cool. I'm very happy alone. That's why. Oh, no! Shylu, are you laughing? Why are you asking? It feels like jiggling the gold coins in a bronze pot. I'll thrash you. Surely someone else's wife sounds more exotic to you. Oh, no! the husband ghost. Run away. Hey! Who is he? Looking plumpy? Pandi, he is Senthil. Oh, is he Senthil? Let it be. How long were you hugging? Two minutes. You betrayed me for 120 seconds. Why did you lie to him that we are ghosts? If I reveal that I'm taking up these roles for bread and butter. My pride will go for a toss. That's why I had to lie. Guess the ex-lovers stalk the girls even after they become ghosts. We mustn't stay here even for a minute. Come on. How are we gonna survive? I'll make you perform in the streets like always. Why did you stop? Come, let's go. You slapped me for fun, right? No, I slapped you for real. Thanks. Why are you starring at me? Is the slap not enough? I'll accept anything from you. Romantic dialogue? Don't know what's he is upto? Musical lines from the film,"Suryavamsam" Look at her... Swaying around with other men! Why are you feeling hard when I got no issues? She is my girlfriend. She is my wife! You're dancing well. Who is he? Dancing like people dancing in arrack shops? She got some killer moves. She is my wife. You senseless. Why are you torturing? Come, let's dance. Enough, stop it. Stop it. I'll break your limbs, if you try to hold her. It's my fault to marry a dancer. Shylu! Where am I? We're in the ghost house. It's a haunted house. Come, let's go. Aren't you ghosts then? No. Get lost. Shylu! Hey, are you trying to break my family? If you repeat such assignment, I won't accept it. Hey, what are you blabbering? Hey, who is blabbering? Really there is a ghost in that house. Hey, listen to what I say. Senthil! What? Expecting your lover to watch from upstairs? He would've gorged a big container full and would be sleeping. Come on. He too let us down. If it continues, Saravanan will sell off this house. Half the prints in the hand are missing. Kali. Anu, tell me dear. Brother, where are you? Mom is asking for you. I'll finish my work and come in two days. Inform mom. Okay, brother. Call me, if anything urgent. Else, will you note the address? - Tell me. - 1/212, Lakshmi Nagar, Manimangalam. Noted it? Take care of mom. Okay. Chief! Chief, I'm calling my wife, but she isn't attending. Don't know what happened. I think my son is not well. I'll go and meet her in person. Only then I will feel relaxed. Nothing would have happened to your son. Go and come back. Okay, chief. Hey, Thangam. Come back, please. Don't booze and doze off. No, chief. I'll come back. Eat this cake. Does it taste good? Dad, next time bring me a creamy cake. Sure, dear. You are here to get money to booze, right? I've prayed for our son's health and saved money to offer to God. Take it and booze. Take it. You've mistaken me, Vasanthi. I didn't come here for the money. Within two days, I'll come with the money for our son's surgery. Believe me. I swear on you. You've made thousands of promises like this. It's okay, even if you don't earn. But, whenever you get the money, you take it to booze. Dear, I won't booze, hereafter. I'm fed up with your fake promises. Believe me one last time. I swear on our son. I won't booze, hereafter. I have a good news for you. All we need to do is stay here for this night. The Salem mills group has confirmed to buy this house. The house owner has informed that the registration will be done soon. Hey! hurrah! Seems like they are going to build a hotel. Sir, once the hotel is built here, you're the supervisor. Nanda is the chief security. God save us! Hey, all are happy. Why are you looking so sad? Eat it. Kali, congratulations! Congratulations, okay. Look here, let's booze and enjoy to the core. I don't want. Is that you who spoke? My dear, is that you who spoke? It’s true. I swore I'll not booze hereafter. On him? No, on my son. So, I'll not booze till I die. Thangam, just booze today. None will force you to booze, hereafter. Why are you forcing him when he doesn't want to? Give his share to me. Get lost. Serve me a large. I'll bring cold water from the refrigerator. Okay, go. Be careful. Don't get hit. Will you drink? No, I'll not break my promise. Leave him. Give it to me. Hey, how can I leave him? If he doesn't booze, we're all dead tonight. Has no clue... Come on. That's it... Come on, drink it. That's it... Drink it. That's it... Oh, my gosh! Is it gone? Oh, no. Kali, come here for a moment. If I don't booze at nights, my limbs tremble. So, better tie me. Don't untie, whatever happens. I promised on my sick son. I fear something might happen to my son… …if I break my promise. Whether I say or even the God comes down and says, you shouldn't untie me. Okay? Tonight situation is going to be a nightmare. I'm with you friend. Don't worry. I'll not untie, whatever happens. If a lion comes now... -I'll not... If a tiger comes... -I'll not... When a ghost comes... No chance. Even if you die, I'll not untie. Because, I don't care about anything Kali, enough of tying him. Come on. Kali, I swore just for pride. I can't control myself. Untie me. I'll booze too. Don't worry, Thangam. I'll tell you a story that will keep you sober for now. There were two ghosts in a town One is teetotaler and the other is a drunkard. The ghosts have come. You shouldn't lie to booze. I promise, turn back and have a look. The ghosts are standing. Hey! The fragrance of basil may change but not Kali's words. Be careful. I did tell you. It's a haunted house. Chief, at least you listen to me. It's a haunted house. Nothing, don't be scared. I casually pat my thigh. But, his chair moved towards me. Like he said, it's a haunted house. Hey, there are no ghosts. It's here, I've seen. Untie me, first. Just a minute. Where is the ghost? Test it by patting your thigh That's all, right? Untie me, first. Kali! Save me. Get me down. Kali! He has come down, right? Get me down. Save me. Did I push you up? Just wait. Kali, if you keep doing that, your skull will be shattered. Leave him. I've a family. Save me. Wait, I'll bring a ladder and save you. Don't be afraid. Nanda! Come soon. Get me down. I'm scared. Hey dude, why are you idle when things here are bizarre! Oh, you don't have vision at nights, right? Thangam is hanging mid air. Can you hear me? Nanda, come. Get me down. Save me. I'm coming. Hey! Are you crazy? Come... Come... It will pierce through my stomach. What are you doing, Nanda? It'll pierce through the stomach. - Help him. - Get me down. What happened? Thank God! I got saved. Nothing, right? I pleaded to untie me. Why did you come here? No. Mom, you shouldn't be here. Come on. - Hey, come. - Come on. Let's go out. Open the door. - Is anybody out? - Open the door. Oh, no! Save us. - Open the door. - Mom! Open the door. Is anyone outside? - Is anyone outside? - Pull it... - Mom! - Is anyone outside? - Open the door. - Mom! Mom, don't go there. they're ghosts. They'll kill you. Don't go. Come. Mom, come. She is my wife. This is our house. We haven't left this house for her sake. She is my mother! Mom, let's go. - Mom, a good news. - What? I got a job offer in Malaysia. - Mom, explain it to dad. - Wait. Dear, give him a nod and happily send him off. Dad, I'll be back in a year. How can we both stay without you? Didn't you get any other job here? Dad, it's not far. Just a four hour journey. I'll come whenever needed. I'll speak to you in Skype, everyday. You've decided to go. Okay, go ahead. Thank you, dad. Oh, God! Dear! Dear! Wait. Kamala! What happened? "A new day shines ..." "Bright and radiant" "Family brings us warmth..." "A wonderful blessing it is!" "A new day shines..."

"The blue hue will never fade" "and my sky is a pond of shooting stars!"" "When the lamp of joy is always lit..." "the home becomes a shrine of its own!" - Saravana! - Mom! It has been a long time. - How are you, mom? - I'm good. - Dad, how are you? - I'm good. How are you? Why is this grey hair, looking like an old man? I'm not colouring. Hey, no. Dad, I bought you a sweater. Hello! Hello! Are you good? - I'm good. - Your favourite colour. Mom, I bought an awesome necklace. - I like it very much. - It's nice. Hey, keep it. I bought you biscuits. - Take it. - Thanks. Hey, have you started smoking? Mom, no. Who is this? It's you. Dad, I need to talk to you, personally. Come on, Nivedha. Let's go there and play. Dad! Tell me. Dad, I started a new business in Malaysia but incurred loss. I borrowed money to fix it. That too ended up as loss. If I don't settle all those, The good name I've earned so far and my hardwork... ...everything will be in vain. You've to help me. How much money? I don't have hefty money. I know, dad. If you sell this house and give me money... I'll settle everything. You don't need to worry. I'll take you and mom to Malaysia and take good care. How can we come with you to Malaysia? These kids have been with me all these years. Where will they go? Dad, I'm your son. But, you're worried about someone else. Are they someone? They've been with me and taken care of me all these days. Although you can't stay with us in our old age, Do you intend to grab the house we live in? Dad, I went to Malaysia on business affairs. But, will you support the orphans? Orphans! Who are orphans? We're orphans despite having a son. They're my son, daughter and granddaughter. I'm going to convert this as the 'home for destitutes'. Meera will take care of everything, after my death. I'll give the ownership of this house to Meera. Mom, why is he acting crazy? Yes, I'm crazy. - Dear! -Brother! Hey, if you address me as you brother, I'll shame you. Hey! Dad has blood pressure. The doctor told him not to get tensed. Being an orphan, you dare to advice me? Saravana! Only orphans know the value of parents. Don't utter a word, anymore. Get out. Out... Why must she go out? You go out. Why should I go? Because, we can't live without them. Hey, if you utter a word, I won't give a damn about our relationship. Hey, how dare to speak to him? Damn it. You rot in this house. Saravana! Stop. Saravana! Kamala, he has left our life, long before. Our children will be with us only till a certain stage. - Let him go. - Dad! Won't you eat? I'm not hungry. Grieving for your son? He didn't visit us out of love. He came to sell the house and take the money. He didn't get it, so he left. Leave it. Whatever... He came home after so many years... You're always a mother. He didn't even consider us. Assets are always problematic. Eat now. I can't take this lightly. If he is important to you, go and stay with him. You guys want an personal invitation? Eat now. Mom. I'm sorry. It's all because of me. No...not so. Things will fall in place in a couple of days… …I’ll bring him home. Give him tablet and go to bed. Go… We dined and slept. That's all we remember. Don't know, what happened to us and how we died. That night... On that night... Saravana! Mom! Mom! Will she be alright, sir? Definitely. Thank you, sir. I saw my son killing him. There can be no big punishment for a mother in this world. We suffered the most despite making no mistake. But, the one who is guilty is Scot free. It seems our problems are nothing compared to theirs. We can get solution for our problems. Wandering with no remorse... ...their loss can't be made up at any cost. Ask him to come. Hello, Saravanan sir! Your parents have come from Wayanad. Oh, really? Will you come, soon? Okay, you take care of them. I'll come. Okay, come sir. Sir, a missing case file is long pending. What's the case? This woman has lost her memory in an accident. Someone has filed a complaint to find her whereabouts. So, she didn't go to Wayanad. She's here, staying with Senthil. He killed his father and claims that his mother is dead too... He is goofing around here to sell the house. You're a terrible criminal. You even a made fool out of me. Take this one rupee... Register the house in my name and fly to Malaysia. Else, I'll press a homicide case against you. - Hey! - Sir, you! Go... Sir, I... - Sir, I'll explain... - Hey, shut up. Guru, what are you doing? Leave him. Thank you, Senthil. Thank you, so much. Where are my parents? Mom! How are you? Hope you were safe during the Wayanad floods. Why are you standing, mom? Be seated. Where is Dad? Is he taking rest, upstairs? Okay...okay... You could've informed me on phone. I searched for you, everywhere. You've come. That's enough. I'm happy... Just a minute. I'll be back. You know one thing. I killed my father for this house. I poisoned their food. But, my mom escaped. Blessed with long life. But, today? She mustn't scape. Guru, my mom... Did you think that I will spare you guys after knowing the truth? Sir, please! Kill everyone along with them. Sir... Please, sir. Leave us. Sir... Poor soul. Leave her, sir. No, sir. Don't shoot, sir. Sir! Mom, go away. No, sir. Listen to me. Mom, go away. Guru, what happened? I shot her. But she is unharmed. Shoot properly. Saravana! You! Nanda, come. Let's go. Mom, ask her to spare me. Mom, tell her to let me go. Hey, you... Sitting idle. Ask her to leave me. Where is everyone? Help! "A new day shines..." "Bright and radiant" "Family brings us warmth..."
