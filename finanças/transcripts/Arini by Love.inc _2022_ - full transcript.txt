Please follow the guide in the application and explore yourself. See yourself deeply. As an agent, you must be able to become anyone and do everything. Gain your client's trust in whatever you do.

You are supposed to ask why do they sleep soundly and we don't? Why? That's because we missed the dessert. What do you mean by the dessert? That dessert can make us sleep soundly. The brownies? In this place, our sleeping time is set by the company. We shouldn't awake at this time. That dessert ensures everyone to sleep soundly. Where are you going? I want to prove what you just said. Don't. What happened to your hand? This is my life's diary. What does it mean? It reminds me about myself. About who I am. So, you don't know about yourself. Please don't be silly. Who owns this book? Who wrote this? It's your diary during your life here. The entire content of this book was written by you at this place. It's to remind you about the erased memories. This is mine. MY NAME IS TIARA Does it hurt? It hurts. But it'll hurt more if we can't remember our life's happy memories. Working in this place erased all of it. I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm confused. Do you know that it's not our first time to meet or come to this place? Do you mean de javu? PRIMA WARNA PRINTING 25% OFF TO ARINI. IF YOU FORGOT ABOUT THIS BOOK THAT MEANS IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE READ IT. THIS BOOK IS YOUR MEMORY. This is the first stage of training. Look at the mirror and follow the guide in the application. The first stage of this training focused on character-shaping as an agent. Please focus and listen to the instructions carefully. Arini. Focus. Look at the mirror. Hi. I'm Arini. Hey, you. Please tell her that you're my girlfriend. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about the notes and pictures that I wrote in this book. Why can't I remember even just one? Strangely, I keep thinking about someone. I have no clue. He's always on my mind. Who is he? I don't know. I can't remember him. They're like pieces of puzzle stuck in my mind. What does he looks like? Is there no information about him in that book? He is definitely a guy. He is older than me, I guess? How old are you now? I don't know. Do you know how old are you? It is my birthday. Tiara. Yesterday, you told me that it's not our first encounter. What do you mean by that? Everything we're doing now we've done all of them before. This hideaway. That book, you deliberately hid it here. And why are there a lot of turtle drawings in this book? Everything in that book is written by you. Like you I write things I want to remember. Perhaps the guy in your memory is a part of your past when you worked here. There are CCTVs in this entire building. Especially, in the third floor. We're not allowed to go there. Is there something in the third floor? What do you mean? Something only they know. Yes, Ma'am. Roger that, Ma'am! Ms. Diana asked for coffee to her room. Alright, Ma'am. I'll do that immediately. WELCOME! Excuse me, Ms. Diana. -These are the new agent's contracts. -On the second left. Excuse me. Come to my room now. Alright, Ma'am. I spilled my coffee. Please clean it up. Yes, Ma'am. -Thank you. -Excuse me. -You have beautiful eyes. -Really? Do you see that? The key of relationship is communication. Listen to your partner. Try to listen to understand. Not listening to respond. Give a round of applause for your comrades. Now is your turn to do communication simulation. Come forward. You are randomly matched with the people we have chosen. It is important because later, on the field you'll meet clients from various circles. Can I see your hand? Okay. Are you someone who's closed-off? But from what I see, if you've known them intimately you'll slowly open yourself. -Am I right? -How do you know that? Have we met before? I just met you here. But your face looks so familiar. Perhaps, it is because of chemistry. Okay. It is my turn. May I? Can you do a palm reading? I can't. Okay, please teach me how to do that. Okay. The upper line shows our career. The lower lines shows our health. Have you had lunch? Have you had lunch? What? Let's have lunch. Shall we? Excuse me. Can we excuse ourselves for a bit? Fifteen minutes. The simulation will not end until your client gives a rating. Tiara. Do you remember the guy I told you about? The one who always shows up in your memories? I want to find him. Don't tell me you talked to that guy? The one you were with earlier today. No. But he has a picture in his hand that reminds me of the past. And that picture really looks like the one in this book. Like you. And this. You once told me you made this so you can always remember, right? This is my daughter's name. Her name is Hanna. That's what this Braille writing means. I left her at an orphanage to work here. I don't have anyone who can look after my daughter. In this place, our memories won't last long. What do you mean? The feelings we have that disrupt our concentration as agents will be erased. Our job is only to fulfill the needs of client, as the company orders us to. What we feel, comes second. Mom, this is Tiara. My girlfriend. You're so beautiful, Dear. Thank you. I'm tired of always pretending and sacrificing what I feel to make someone else happy. I give you my blessing. Look after each other, okay? I don't want to be here any longer. How did you get here, Tiara? Do you remember? We once met, in a room. Let go! -They kept bringing me to that room. -Nurse! I want to leave! That wasn't the first time they erased my memory. The same for you. Do they think they can erase my memory, just like that and make us bow down to the rules with ease? They forgot that strong memories will defeat anything. Especially beautiful memories. I've succeeded in that. I'm certain that you'll be able to do it, too. You and I have known each other and been friends before, Arini. You might not realize it now but one day, you'll remember everything. The only thing you have to do is to dig into your subconscious. If one day we forget I hope this can be a reminder for us. We'll never forget. That's because the only one who can answer your biggest question is your own self. -I'm sure that he can help us, Tiara. -Who? That guy? I'm not sure that's the right decision. You just met him. I'm certain. He is nice. I don't want you to be reckless. You're the one who's always been reckless. The one who always rebels. I have a reason, Arini. I want to leave! I will find any way to get out of here. Yes, me, too. I want to try and trust him. He might be able to help us in a better way, Tiara. Without being reckless. Tiara. We have to make an effort. Do you think it's easy being separated from your own child for years? That's why I don't want to be like you. Four. Keep going. -Thirty minutes? -A little more. -Ouch! -Sorry! -This needs to be treated. -No need. -It could get infected. -No need. What's wrong? Take a break, okay? Drink. Galang, I want to ask you something but you have to answer honestly, okay? Okay. Have we met before? -Well, didn't we met yesterday? -No. I mean, outside of this place. -Have we met before? -Arini. The very first time I met you, was here. At this place. But did you ever know who you are? Where you came from? Or the people you met out there? -Your family, maybe? Your loved ones? -Hey. I already told you everything in the last training. Is that really your story or is it just a brief from here? Arini. Not here, okay? We're training. Okay? We'll find the right time to talk about all of this. But, not now. Not here. Arini. Arini. So, what do you want to talk about? Open up. Arini. -I'll open it. -No, I'll do it. The two of them must be separated. Both have the tendency to run. -Yes. -Open up! Open up! Open up! Open up! In the past year this is the third time they've tried to escape. If they keep being resistant, it can hinder the company's progress! Look in the mirror and follow the instructions. We must use a different method this time. Yes, Ma'am. Follow the instructions in the application and explore yourselves. Focus. Look in the mirror. Take a good look at yourself. You must be able to become anyone and do anything. Follow the instructions in the application and explore yourselves. Focus. Look in the mirror. Take a good look at yourself. You must be able to become anyone and do anything.

Focus. Look in the mirror. Take a good look at yourself. If one day we forget, I hope this can be a reminder for us. Stop! You'll never forget. You just have to listen deeper inside. That's because the only one who can answer your biggest question is your own self. I'm Arini, Sir. Arini Kusuma. Please wait. That was... I want to, if you don't mind. Well, you choose.
