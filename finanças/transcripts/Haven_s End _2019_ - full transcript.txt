(SIRENS WAILING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) REPORTER: Several localities across the metro area are in chaos at this hour. Reports of gunfire and explosions from multiple locations around Atlanta continue to pour in. It all started almost an hour ago when a man hijacked a postal truck and drove it through the front of a home improvement store in Buckhead. A man then began shooting and stabbing individuals in the store. Since then, police and fire units have been trying to respond to a growing number of incidents, but the streets are clogged with the rush hour drivers. WOMAN: News Center Eight has just received confirmation of another event, Jim. According to Georgia DOT, what witnesses are calling a truck bomb has just been detonated on the 85 north ramp lanes near the top of Spaghetti Junction. The lanes effected by the brunt of the blast have crumbled and fallen. JIM: Dear God. WOMAN: No word on the number of dead or wounded yet, but an estimated 12 to 16 vehicles, including a school bus, were seen dropped into the destroyed railway. Paramedics, fire, and rescue, and team road units are en route to the scene. We'll keep you updated as more information comes out. JIM: Metro area hospitals are bracing for the incoming wave of wounded from these events. News Center Eight has received word that Grady Hospital is calling in all off duty medical personnel to deal with the swelling number of patients. Other area hospitals are expected to follow suit. So if you are a member of the Grady Hospital medical staff, please report to work as soon as possible. You are sorely needed. - (PHONE RINGING) - Are you seeing this? ALISON: Well, of course I saw. It's all over the news. THERESA: Alison. Look, Theresa. You are gonna need every pair of hands that you can muster today. Bullshit administrative leave or not. THERESA: Your privileges have been revoked, Alison, you can't even set foot in the hospital without a board vote. I am the best trauma doctor that you have. THERESA: You're a liability. I need to be there! THERESA: Not gonna happen. Stay at home and keep your head down. I'll call you if anything changes, but don't hold your breath. Look, Theresa. I can do whatever the hospital needs. - It doesn't have to be- - I've gotta go, Alison. (ALISON GRUNTS) Fucking bureaucrats! (ALISON SIGHS) Things aren't slowing down either, at the iconic Marietta Landmark, the big chicken is engulfed in fire after an explosion inside. A group of customers and staff have gotten out of the building, but the blaze is out of control and currently threatening nearby structures. We cannot rightfully confirm this fire is... Theresa's letting you go in? Hospital's swamped, it's all hands on deck. (SIRENS WAILING) What about the board? I'm a doctor, Derek. Not right now. Fine, then I will be a good Samaritan and I will triage patients on the street. First respondents already have enough to deal with. What if I just grabbed a gun and ran outside to assist the police? But the victims- - They have other people to help them. You broke the rules, Al. Getting benched is a consequence. I know, I get it. I really do, but it's wrong. I mean, I can save lives. All I did was save a life. I know. You'll be back in action for the next mass shooting, I promise. (SCOFFS) That is not funny. (KNOCKING) JESS: Ali? Jess? (SIGHS) Thank God. I'm here and the door's closed behind me. Really? Overprotective much? Say hello to my wife. ALISON: Hi, Stella. See? She's here and Derek's here, and I'm okay. Just you go to your briefing, be careful, and call me when you can. Love you. Stella got called up and she's being paranoid and she doesn't want me to be alone, so sleep over? Sure. Governor's mobilizing the National Guard. Sounds like a good call. I don't know, seems like overkill to me. Yeah, I thought so too, but Stella said what's happening is worse than what they're letting on. I knew it, I felt it. (BOOMING) Shit! (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (SIRENS WAILING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BOOMING) (ALISON GASPS) Shit. (ALISON PANTING) (SIRENS WAILING) (BOOMING) The Center for Disease Control has been rocked by a massive explosion. The blast was felt more than 20 blocks away and big dark smoke is now rising into the air. No word yet on whether the blast has reached any of the numerous laboratories or hazardous containment units inside, but the damage to the structure is said - to be devastating- - I gotta get down there. Are you insane? We just had this conversation. Things are different now! Yeah, it's a lot worse. Running into death isn't always the best choice, Ali. It's the right thing to do, Derek. Right isn't better than smart. Guys, are you seeing this? In what appears to be an extremely well coordinated terror attack, the greatest cities across the nation, and now around the world, have all come under fire within moments of each other. Social media sites are crashing under the weight of the cell phone footage documenting attacks in New York, Chicago, Paris, London, Berlin, Cairo, and a dozen other cities. FEMALE REPORTER: Including here Atlanta. More breaking news now. The Atlanta Police Department has issued the following statement via Twitter: "CDC compromised, immediate quarantine of surrounding area. Details to follow." (DRAMATIC MUSIC) This is nuts, there's too much gunfire. Can't tell the good guys from the bad. It's Stella. "Situation's critical, evacuate now someplace safe. Find you when it's over." Two minutes. Grab what you can. I know a place we can go. MALE REPORTER: Back to Emory now as the chaos expands from the site of the nearby CDC explosion. There are... (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) We should take the access road. It'll get us to the freeway faster. Police presence might make it safe for the larger roads. (SIRENS WAILING) (BOOMING) - Or not! - Let's go! FEMALE REPORTER: In a statement released moments ago, representatives from the Atlanta mayor's office have confirmed more than 300 deaths and well over a thousand casualties on the Emory campus alone. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hazardous material teams have begun entering the Center for Disease Control, gathering bodies and debris for identification and testing. The president has said that while Martial Law is not in effect, they will be deploying soldiers and marines to several affected cities across the nation. I'm still not getting anything. The network damage must be massive. Might've targeted cell towers. Maybe farther outside of the city? Rural towers could still be up. I need to let Stella know I'm safe. I know she's worried about me. Trust me, she's busy right now. What he means is, Stella sent you to us because she knew we would do everything we could to keep each other safe. She's going to assume the best until she hears otherwise, and that's exactly what we're going to do. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) MALE REPORTER: The Federal Aviation Administration has reported that all commercial flights are on the ground and accounted for, and all commercial air travel is suspended. Across the country, police departments have instituted curfews, some to take effect as early as sundown. And with multiple terrorist organizations claiming responsibility for this worldwide tragedy and promising more bloodshed in the coming days, fear is rising. (STATIC BUZZING) Hey, maybe give it a rest for awhile? We should be getting something. We're not that far out. There's gonna be a warehouse up here on the left in a bit. We can stop to get some more supplies and I'll drive from there and it'll just be easier. More supplies? How long are you planning on being here? It's not about length of stay, Jess, it's about comfort. I mean, why rough it if we don't have to, right? (ENGINE RUMBLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) DEREK: Is anyone even here? None of the windows are broken, doors look secure. Harry's here. And if I'm right, this parking lot is pretty much the safest place in the country right now. And if you're wrong? Just drive slowly and follow my lead. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) HARRY: You dumbfucks just won't learn, will ya? Get the fuck off my property or I swear to God - I'm gonna riddle you- - Harry! With so many goddamn holes swiss cheese - is gonna be jealous. - Hey, Harry! HARRY: What? It's Alison Olsen. HARRY: Tom's girl? Yes, sir! HARRY: Little Alison? Yes, sir! HARRY: Oh shit. Your dipshit fucktard numbnut brother with ya? No, sir, he's not. It's just my friend Jessi and my fiance. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) He's Army. Army? Fucking hell, Alison. Hoped you'd learn from your mama's mistake and know better than to marry a goddamn soldier. Well, we haven't said I do yet, so there's still time for me to wise up. You open? Only for family. Come on in, quick, quick, quick, let's go, let's go. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hustle, Army. (DOOR CLATTERING) Sorry to meet under these circumstances. Last I heard, you were in Atlanta. Yes, Sir. Shit. It sounds like the CDC was one hellacious clusterfuck. Glad you all are okay. So, welcome to my palace. I hope you're not OCD. What do ya think? We could use some help, Harry. Shit, you kidding me? Your daddy would kick my ass if he were here and I turned you away. Whatever you need. Damn good man, your daddy. Even if he was Army. - (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) - What you got against Army? What I got against Army? You know what Army stands for? Ain't Ready For Marines Yet. Semper Fidelis, son. Why don't you get soldier boy here a tshirt that's lying around. On the house. Hoorah! He's a laugh riot. - Hey, Harry! - Yo! You still keep the candy in the same place? HARRY: Oh yeah, plenty of candy in the candy jar. Whatever you need, take double. There's candy? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) It looks like the NRA threw up in here. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey, Al? Yeah? JESS: Just in case? Just in case. Hey, Harry, thanks for everything. We really appreciate it. HARRY: Yeah. You going out to your daddy's spot and wait this shit out? That's the plan. You should come with us. Nah, thanks. This is my place. We might have a little trouble getting the three of you out of here. What's up? When all this shit started a few mouth-breathing good old boys thought they'd come take what they wanted so they could play war and I disabused them of that notion right quick. But now they're back. And my guess is they were waiting for dark, but got perturbed when you gained entry. They think you're taking all the good toys. Think they'll listen to reason? I do not. I know these boys. They are big and mean and dumb as a box of hair. And most of 'em can't shoot for fucking shit, but if they start they're gonna spray around enough lead to hit something, so we are gonna have to lay down some presser fire to keep them tucked back while Army here loads the truck. Hey. You handle the cover fire, I'll get the stuff to the truck. I'm just as fast as you are for short distances. I'm stronger, some of that gear is really heavy- - Hey kids, we don't have time for political discussions. Somebody take the rifle, somebody grab the car. Let's go. Okay. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) There we go. Cover fire only, Harry. No causalities? (HARRY GRUNTS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GUNS POPPING) HARRY: On the left, Al. Let's go, let's go! Come on, Jess. (JESS WHIMPERS) Stay low! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jessi! Derek, help me! (JESS PANTS) Come on up. Come on up. Get her in the car, get her in the car. DEREK: Go go go! (JESSI GROANS) Harry! (ENGINE RUMBLING) Oh god, oh! (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (JESSI CRIES) Oh god. How's she doing? Jess, I know this is gonna hurt, but I gotta get in there and see what's going on, okay? Ali, I'm pregnant, 14 weeks. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Well, thank god you told me. I thought you were just getting fat. You are an evil bitch and no one likes you. Okay, okay, okay, just breathe, just breathe. I got you both. Okay, all right. Okay, okay. All right, okay. Bullet went straight through. I don't feel any chipped or broken bones. That's good. I don't like this bleeding though. I can't close it up until I know what's going on in there. You? We need to take her to the hospital. Nearest one's about an hour in the opposite direction. Property's closer, head there. HARRY: Done. This is your pregnant friend with a bullet wound. Anything that I would need is in that EMT kit. I just need a flat surface and some room to work. What about x-rays, cat scan? - You got that in your bag? - Derek! Stop telling the trauma doc what her patient needs. I'm just trying to save the trauma doctor from repeating the same mistake. What about the baby? There's no guarantee either way. But there's no doctor in the world who will love this baby more than I do. I am her godmother after all. Oh, are you? I am now. (JESSI CRIES) Go! (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Harry, grab the kit and make sure the table's cleared off. The trailer should be open. What the? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Is somebody here? (BOOMING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MEN GROANING) Leave us alone and tell Marcus to fuck off! (MEN GRUNTING) Stealing my property! Kevin! What the fuck are you doing here? Focus! Who is in the trailer? Uh, it's Hanna, she's my girl- - Get her out! I need that trailer now. Get her out! Are you okay? I'm fine. Jesus Christ, Harry. KEVIN: Hanna? God damn it, Kevin. Get her out now! - Okay, it's- - Now! (KEVIN HUSHES) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) It's my sister and her friend, okay? Hanna, baby, don't shoot. Hanna, don't shoot. (HANNA SOBS) (GUN CLICKING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay, bring her in. I need you guys outta the way, outta the way. Kevin, hand me that towel! (HANNA SHRIEKS) Kevin, get them, okay? Here you go. Okay, okay, thank you. Kevin, give me the med kit. It didn't look like a girl when I pulled the trigger. - Is she okay? - You're okay, you're okay. - Here. - Thank you. - I'm so sorry- - Get her out of here! - Okay, you're okay. - Okay, okay, - we're gonna go outside. - Okay, okay. There we go. Yeah, we're good. Please don't say we shoulda gone to the hospital. I was only gonna ask how I could help. (HEAVY BREATHING) I think I got this now. How's your arm? No gushers, just a couple of stitches maybe. I'll feel better once I kick your brother's ass. Yeah, I'd do it myself if I wasn't a little busy right now. She'll be okay, Al. We all will. Harry won't. (SOMBER MUSIC) (BUGS CHIRPING) KEVIN: I covered your friend up. The blood was freaking Hanna out. Hey man, I'm really sorry about your arm. (THUDDING) Oh. That's for this. (KEVIN SPITS) Guess we're even. I didn't say that. This place is a mess. How long have you been squatting here? I wouldn't call staying at a family place squatting. A little over a month. I'm not using, Ali, I'm clean. I thought this would be a nice quiet place to focus on- - I can see what you've been focusing on. Great, here we go. Look, if you are actually clean this time, then I am happy for you, but you are not supposed to be here, Kevin. Yeah, well you can't keep me from- - Your girlfriend just killed a man. - That was an accident! - Hey, Hanna. Just stay outta this. It's okay, I got it handled. Shit. Did I do that? You told me to point the gun at the door. You told me to shoot him and they were gonna kill us. This isn't your fault. Can you find a safe place for Harry? Yeah. ALISON: Thank you. What about my face? (ALISON SCOFFS) You and I got off to a bad start. I'd like to fix that. I'm Alison. Hanna. It's nice to meet you, Hanna. Um, are any of your teeth feeling loose? Can you move your jaw? That's good. Okay. May I? This is gonna sting, I'm sorry. Okay. It's gonna be sore for a few days and you need to keep it clean, okay? I'm sorry that I elbowed you in the face. (CRIES) I'm really sorry I killed your friend. Hanna. I really did, I wish Kevin had never given - me that stupid fucking gun. - Hanna, Hanna, Hanna. You're hyperventilating, okay? Listen, you're gonna be fine, but I just, I need you to breathe with me, okay? Slow it down. - I killed your friend - Hanna! And you're being so fucking nice to me. Listen, we don't blame you. I know that it was an accident. It wasn't your fault. Okay? It really wasn't. (SOBBING) I don't wanna go to jail. Hanna, listen. Don't worry about that right now, okay? The police have bigger things to deal with, trust me. And when this is all over, Derek and I will go down to the police station with you and we will explain everything. You won't face any charges, okay? You will? ALISON: We will. You promise? I promise. Thank you. (MUFFLED TALKING) (ALISON LAUGHS) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (RUSTLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (THUDDING) Horse shit. I don't care if you believe it or not. It's the truth. Even the radio? Nothing on any station. All that means is you have a shitty radio. The cell service is down too. That doesn't mean dick, it's always spotty out here. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Grab that. Maybe we can use it. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (DOOR CREAKING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (JESSI GROANS) - Sorry. - Ow, why do you hate me? DEREK: Hey, you. How ya feeling? Like I got punched by a rhino. You're just gonna be sore for awhile, but no permanent damage. What about the baby? It's too soon to tell, Jess. I'll know more in 24 hours, but I'm really hopeful. I walked some of the perimeter. This is a smart spot; secluded, remote, one way in and out, clear sight lines. I'll have a better sense tomorrow, but we could secure this place. Good call. The minute Jess got Stella's text it just popped into my head. It's always felt like a safe haven. Until tonight. Where's Kevin? KEVIN: Hey there, Red. How ya feeling? JESS: Nauseated. DEREK: Is that everything? Yeah, I think so. ALISON: I can't believe dad still had this thing. Does it work? Maybe. We need it to. Who knows when cell service will be back up. It's our best chance of staying safe until the cavalry arrives. It's not the cavalry. Mark my words, kung fu grip, if this thing's real, the government's behind it. You mark my words. You call me kung fu grip again, I'll make sure this time you swallow your teeth. Ha! I can see why you like him, Ali. These Heathkit units are pretty sturdy. Probably just needs a good cleaning and a couple of tubes replaced. If you can find some of the parts out in the shed I should have this up and running in a few minutes. All I need is a Philip's head screwdriver. (GROANS) Oh, and to not be shot. Hey, you know what? It's late, you can work on this tomorrow. You don't need to push it. Doctor's orders. My doctor and the toxic masculinity twins can get out of my hair. You can be my hands. I'll help. I'm not leaving. You can stay, but no doctoring. Good, now disconnect that wire. So, you're married to a girl? Stella. These are next. You know, I identify as bi-curious. I marched in Pride twice. You know, I chose you to help me with this because I thought you were the quiet one. Look, I'm not trying to be your best friend or anything, but I just had the worst day of my life and I work better with background noise. So, how did you guys meet? It's so mundane. Coffee shop. Barista got our orders confused. She took one sip and spit it out all over herself. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, be sure to clean that or it's gonna give us trouble. - There. - Yeah, I see it. Oh, what next? Oh, then just reconnect everything and we're done. No, I mean with Stella. Oh. I offered to pay for her dry cleaning. She said, "Take me to dinner instead." I told her she seriously overestimated the worth of her shirt. She laughed, I laughed. That was six years ago. We've been together ever since. Never did get that shirt cleaned. Stella had it framed and gave it to her as a wedding present. Really? That sounds like one of those documentary stories. I think it's really sweet. I think we're done. Oh, flip it. (CLICKING) (JESS SIGHS) You can try again in the morning. Work, you piece of shit! (CLANKING) (STATIC BUZZING) (JESS GROANS) Woo! (ALL LAUGHING) Good work. I'm gonna pass out now. Oh. REPORTER: The last hour has seen another wave of explosions leaving tens of thousands of victims dead across the globe. The causalities are rising here at home as well. That's enough, shut it off. REPORTER: The National Guard has been called up in all 50 states, and they are attempting to- (CLICKS) HANNA: I can't believe it's real. We barely made it out of Atlanta. Jessi got shot. Trust me, it's real. Well, you're safe here now. We'll be out of your hair in the morning. - Kev, we can all- - No, it's fine. I'm used to it. I'll find somewhere else to squat. Come on, Hanna, we'll stay outside. What's his problem? Kevin was always trouble, but he got worse after Mom died. Drugs, alcohol. When he was 18 he got arrested for petty larceny. Dad had enough. Didn't bail him out, wouldn't let him back in the house. Kevin didn't take that too well. I know we left the city to get away from stupid dangerous people, but I can't kick my own brother out into whatever the hell is going on out there. Can I? (LIGHT MUSIC) (LEAVES RUSTLING) (GROUND RUSTLING) Hey. You been up all night? They took some food and water. Blankets, a few flares, and a shotgun. Thought he was bluffing. Should we try and bring him back? Can't force them to stay, Al. Think they're gonna be okay? Do we really care? (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROUND RUSTLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) I think we should go back. If what they said on the radio's true, we'd be safer. No, Hanna, we're not. My sister and I, we don't get along the best of days. And you, you did kill her friend. Well, she knows that wasn't on purpose and she promised she'd tell the police when we got back that it was an accident. That's what she said when she thought she needed you. What is she really gonna say when she gets back to civilization? You don't trust your own sister? We haven't been family for a long time. Family shouldn't kick you out. Well, they didn't kick us out, we left. We could go back. You're my family, and us going back there isn't safe for us, Hannabear. I'm worried about you. You only call me Hannabear when you want me to do something. We're gonna be fine, trust me. I have it covered. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (JESS COUGHING) You doing okay in there? (JESS GROANS) Morning sickness is hell with a gunshot wound. Did your stitches hold? (HUMS) Just really sore. You're still feverish. You really should lie down. The nausea's worse when I lie down. This is gonna give me something to focus on other than my rollercoaster stomach and the hole in my upper torso. Ali, this sling is really fucking- - Okay. - Uncomfortable, god. You are seriously the worst patient I have ever had, do you know that? You love it. All right, listen to me. If you're not gonna wear your sling, I need you to keep that arm still. And if you're not gonna lie down, I need you to take it easy. Got it? Yes, doctor. I'm gonna go check on Derek. You call me if you need anything. (JESS GROANS) JESS: I just need to talk to my wife. (GROUND RUSTLING) Well, we could go talk to her and I'm sure - she would be fine with- - No, Hanna, we're not going back. HANNA: But we could. No, Hanna, damn it. You don't understand. All right, Ali, she just abandoned me. My dad, he... (KEVIN SIGHS) You know what, you just haven't... (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hanna? Hanna, real cute. Stop playing. Hannabear? (HANNA SCREAMS) Hanna, Hanna! Hanna! (GROUND RUSTLING) (HEAVY BREATHING) No. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN BANGING) (GROUND RUSTLING) Hey, you just getting back? You moved the SUV. In case we're forced to bolt. Loaded some emergency supplies, too. Smart. Thank you. We need to bury Harry. I thought you might wanna pick the spot. Right. Oh shit. I'm sorry, Al. I'm an idiot. (HEAVY BREATHING) You're wonderful. I would like that, thank you. (ALISON SIGHS) Hey, have you slept at all? There's too much stuff to do. I'll just grab some coffee. No. You haven't rested since this thing started. You gotta get off that leg. The longer that you push yourself- - I know my limits, Al. I'm gonna check the perimeter. Hey. No. Look, we made a deal. When the world gets tough, we lean on each other, okay? I just trusted you to hold me while I wept for my friend. You can trust me to take care of things while you take a nap, okay? Okay? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) What the hell? In the stars. - Black stars, dead stars. - Christ, Kevin! What's wrong with him? Kevin! Kevin, where's Hanna? KEVIN: Hanna's in the lights. The lights, they carried the lights in their eyes like stars. - Kevin, look at me! - Black stars, dead stars. Look at me, Kevin! He's seizing, he's seizing! Get him on his side, get him on his side. Jessi, bring me the med kit! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (ALISON SIGHS) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ALISON SIGHS) Well, he's out of immediate danger, but I still can't wake him. And I can't give him a stimulant because he might seize again. Did you find Hanna? No. Did a full sweep 100 yards within the perimeter. (ALISON SIGHS) Did Kevin say anything that could help us get a bearing? Nothing coherent. He just keeps rambling on and on about the lights, the lights. What do you think that is? A common visual hallucination. His pupils are constricted. I think he's high as a kite. I cannot believe I believed him when he said he was clean. But if he's just riding a bad trip, where'd the blood on his hands come from? And where's Hanna? I don't know. And we've only got a couple of hours of daylight left to try to find her. We should get going. Is that a good idea? That doesn't feel like a good idea. I'll go alone. Jessi's still recovering, Kevin's condition can worsen, and Hanna could stumble out of the woods five minutes after I leave. Okay, I'll be the asshole. What if no one goes looking for her? She seems like basically a good kid, but we barely know her. The world's on fire and Kevin's gone banana nut apeshit insane and we don't know what the fuck is going on. That's exactly it. We don't know what the fuck is going on. We have to ask ourselves, do we wanna be the kind of people that would leave someone out in the woods to possibly die? I don't wanna be that person. So, what's the plan? Walk until I hit the ridge, then follow it east. If she's out here, I'll find her. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Only about as far as you can get in an hour or so, okay? I want you back before dark. With or without Hanna. She's not worth losing you. I'll take care of myself. You do the same here. I guess sometimes right is better than smart. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Anyone broadcasting? JESS: You feel that? Feels like a happy baby doing cartwheels. Does that mean she's okay? She's strong like her mommy. Like both her mommies. (JESS SIGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROUND RUSTLING) (STATIC BUZZING) This isn't smart. Just give him a few more minutes. If it were Stella out here, would you listen to me if I told you to give it a few more minutes? Of course not, but I'd hope you'd try to convince me. And for the record, if I wasn't pregnant and nursing a gunshot wound, I'd wrestle you to the ground and sit on you to keep you here. (ALISON SIGHS) Instead I'll just say it again: this isn't smart! (DOOR THUDS) This isn't smart. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jesus, Derek! Fuck. Oh. (EERIE MUSIC) (DEREK SIGHS) What were you thinking? I was looking for you. You just let her go? Hanna? Did you see anything else weird? Any lights? No lights, just this. And an awful lot of blood. I'm gonna need some shuteye. Yeah. Can you take watch? Of course. No more than a few hours, okay? Go. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (STATIC BUZZING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (WHOOSHING) (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) (ALISON GROANING) (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) Kevin? That's where Hanna died. Kevin, can you hear me? We all saw the lights, Ali. ALISON: Kevin! (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) (MOTOR SPUTTERING) Come on. (ALISON SIGHS) Tank's full of gas, ignition sparks. Must be mechanical. I can't keep working on this, I gotta go find Hanna. We have to fix it. Without it we don't have radio. Or clean water. Is he awake? After last night I'm not sure he's ever gonna wake up again. - That was- - Weird as hell? Creepy as fuck? Scary as shit? I was going to say unusual, but I can't argue your point. (THUNDER RUMBLING) You said lights are a common hallucination, so does that make last night a mass hallucination? We all saw the lights, right? Yeah. I don't have enough data to form a hypothesis about last night. Has there been anything about lights on the radio? A lot of stuff about helicopter lights, search lights. Maybe some weird stuff, but I- (DOOR THUDS) ALISON: Hey, Kev. KEVIN: Move. Knock yourself out. How ya feeling? Fine. Why? Just didn't expect to see you up so early after last night. You feel up to working on this? Yeah, Dad used to make me fix this thing with him when I was a kid. Remember? No worries. Yeah, I meant because of Hanna. Who's Hanna? (EERIE MUSIC) (THUNDER RUMBLING) You don't remember Hanna? Kev, what is the last thing that you remember from yesterday? I went for a walk, I came back here, I went to bed, I got up. Are you having any nausea, any blurry vision? - Can I see your- - Ali, stop! What the fuck. I'm fine. Sorry, I'm just worried about you. First time for everything, right? Look, we need the power, I can fix the generator. If you don't want me to do it, - fine. - No, no, no, no, no, no. You're right. You do what you do. We'll get outta your way. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (EERIE MUSIC) (RAIN PATTERING) What the fuck was that? He doesn't remember his girlfriend at all? Kevin's never dealt well with anxiety even when he was clean. The seizures, the memory loss. Maybe it's some sort of dissociated response to stressful stimuli. You mean like some form of PTSD? I consider murdering my girlfriend stressful stimuli. We don't know that he did anything. We don't know that he didn't either. The amount of blood I found the other day. I can't imagine she's still alive out there. And he's unstable at best. So, I'll keep an eye on him. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GENERATOR HUMMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (RAIN PATTERING) Look, we've been safe here up until now. I mean, there's literally nothing that draws attention to this place, and the road in and out is pretty obscured. But if you go 10 or 15 miles in either direction, it's an entirely different story. There's reports of militarized checkpoints, continued looting, quarantine zones. So you're saying things are bad. No shit. So what do we know officially? Our antenna isn't the greatest. We're getting everything secondhand from radio kits closest by. Sometimes late at night when the weather cooperates, we can get something from farther out. We're getting most of our federal info from a guy up in Nashville and another guy down in Central Florida. We're so close to Fort Benning. They should be all over the air. The big bad government's not gonna be saving your bacon this time, knuckle dragger. (SIGHS) Look, I don't know why Benning's been so quiet, but in light of any official news, the conspiracy theorists are having a field day. Right. It's not the terrorists, it's the aliens. Or rather it's the terrorists acting on behalf of aliens unleashing the virus that causes the zombie apocalypse. Or, my personal favorite, the explosion at the CDC opened a gateway to hell. Ah! Even Kevin's bullshit false flag theory's getting some play. Nothing actually happened and we're all just delusional. What about lights? You hear anything about that? (THUNDER RUMBLING) I'm looking through all my notes, searching for something, anything related to that. (JESS SIGHS) The fact is, whatever is happening, it's getting worse, not better. And the shit storm outside is closing in on us. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) We're not gonna be safe here much longer. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOOR CLICKING) I need your help. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROUND RUSTLING) (BIRD CAWING) How ya feeling? Is that why you asked me here? To play nurse for Doc Ali? Nah, but I get it. No health questions. Who's Marcus? (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) You want my help or not? Just trying to make conversation. Seeing he is the reason we're here. He's a former business associate. Next topic. Do you remember how Harry died? Shotgun. DEREK: Who shot him? I, uh... I did. Next topic. Thanks for fixing that generator. KEVIN: No worries. Where'd you get those parts? Couldn't find any of them in the shed. What's with this interrogation? You accusing me of something? Tried to crank my SUV this morning, found a couple parts missing under the hood. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, dude. Don't lie to me. And don't try to play this off with your lost memory bullshit. You stripped my SUV. (KEVIN LAUGHS) You need to cut back on your Ritalin. It's making you paranoid. I see you and I know exactly what you are. That's a choice you don't wanna make, Kevin. Trust me. (CLANGING) Fuck you, asshole. (GROUND RUSTLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) You better pray you can put my ride back together when it's time to leave. Yeah, keep walking, douchebag. (DEREK GRUNTS) (BIRD CAWING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (HEART BEAT THUDDING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BIRD CAWING) KEVIN: Whoa, Ali, don't shoot. Jesus Christ, Kevin, you scared the shit outta me. KEVIN: Sorry. I'm sick of eating MRAs. You wanna come with? Yeah. (LEAVES RUSTLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) I guess that one's gone. Sorry. (GROUND RUSTLING) If you're not gonna but me with a bunch of medical questions, why'd you ask me to come out here with you? You know these woods almost as well as I do. Plus, you were always a better shot. You're lying. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay. I wanted us to have a chance to talk. Clear the air. (STATIC BUZZING) You've experienced some weird, traumatic stuff out here. You've heard what they're saying on the radio. Is anyone out there? ALISON: And I just wanna know that my brother and I are okay. Okay, you wanna do this? Let's do this. We'll start with dad. Why did I have to find out about dad on my own three months after his funeral? Are you kidding me? I called every number I had for you, Kevin. I emailed multiple addresses, I reached out to your friends, I drove seven fucking hours to Nashville to your old apartment because it was the last place I knew you physically lived. I knocked on people's doors like a crazy person. I had Dad cremated so that I could delay the funeral and I did everything by myself because nobody knew where you were. I didn't tell you about Dad, Kevin, (STATIC BUZZING) because I couldn't find you. Does anyone copy this transmission? Anyone? Over. ALISON: When you left home- - KEVIN: You mean when you kicked me out. You didn't wanna live by his rules. He gave you chance after chance. His rules changed after Mom died. Everything changed after Mom died. She was the only person who could soften him even a little and make him look at things. No. No, I'm not gonna stand here while you make excuses for the way he treated me. - (STATIC BUZZING) - You're right. He was hard on you. I need you to answer me, Stella, and I need to know that you're okay. ALISON: But he loved you, Kev. KEVIN: He thought I was a fuckup. You know, the two aren't mutually exclusive, Kevin. I love you, and I think you're a major fuckup. (BOTH LAUGHING) I don't know if you're really clean or not this time, and I don't even know if it matters anymore, we're all fuckups. (STATIC BUZZING) JESS: Does anyone copy this transmission? Anyone? Do you know why I was able to be out here when this shit hit the fan in Atlanta? Because I fucked up royally. I'm not even actually a doctor anymore. I ignored a Do Not Resuscitate order. This older lady, her daughter brought her in. I thought I was doing the right thing. Dad thought he was doing the right thing. I realize now that we were both wrong. I'm sorry that you weren't loved in the best way, Kevin. But you were loved. You still are. Thanks, Sis. Really. It's not that I just- (SCREAMING) The camp. ALISON: No, that came from the other direction. Answer me, god damn it! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) STELLA: Jessica? Honey? Stella? Sweetie? It's me. Hey. You sound so far away. Stella? Where are you? (STATIC BUZZING) STELLA: I'm in hell with our baby. And we'll both see you soon. (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) (JESS GROANS) (ZOMBIES GROANING) (HEAVY BREATHING) Jess? Oh my god, Jess? (STATIC BUZZING) (JESS SCREAMS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) How you feeling? In any pain? You still cramping? (ALISON SIGHS) Can I get you something to eat? Are you hungry? (JESS SNIFFLES) I've got my dinner right (GROANS) here. Jess. I love wine. (JESS SIGHS) I know you do. I love junk food and I love wine and I love Stella. I love you. I love you, too, kiddo. And so does Stella. Don't say her name. Please. You're the best person I know, Ali. You're one of the best people I know too, Jess. (JESS LAUGHS) One of. But not the best. I'm not the best person you know either. Yes, you are. No. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Stella's great. Stella's dead. We don't know that. I know. She told me on the radio. She's dead, our baby's dead, soon I'll be dead. - Jess. - You, Derek- - Jess. - Kevin. - Jess. - And everybody. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jess. We were good together, Ali. We can be good again. I know you miss me. Jess, Jess. You're happily married. This isn't you, this is just the stress, the fear. And oh, you're so worried- (LIPS SMACKING) Jess, no. You wanna be with me, Ali, I know you do, I can tell. But not like this. Then leave me alone. ALISON: Jess. I said leave me the fuck alone! (DOOR CLICKING) (RAIN PATTERING) (METAL CLANGING) How is she? (SIGHS) Grieving, emotionally fragile, despondent, hallucinating. Take your pick. Have you seen Derek? Kung fu grip. He's out patrolling the perimeter making sure there's no nut jobs out there. All right, well if you see him will you tell him I need to talk to him? Please. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Jess? Jessi? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jessi! Jessi! Jessi, Jessi, Jessi, Jessi! Come on, Derek, let's go. It's time to go look for Jess. Sun's up. Oh shit, I got her, I got her, Kevin. Come on! (DARK EERIE MUSIC) Jessi, I'm coming! Get her out, get her out! Get her out! (WATER SLOSHING) No, no! (DARK DRAMATIC MUSIC) I can't, I can't! I can't! Ali! Ali! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh, what the fuck, dude? (THUDDING) (KEVIN GROANS) She's got wounds on her arms just like mine. Wounds you gave me with that knife. The knife I just found under Jessi's body. He killed her, Al. This sack of shit murdered Jessi. Al, you said she was despondent, hallucinating. You also called her emotionally fragile. Are you seriously trying to play this off as suicide? She was butchered! You don't know that. Maybe it was suicide, maybe it was murder. I didn't do it. I haven't seen that knife in days. DEREK: No more lying, you little fucker. Come on, man, don't do this. Don't do this. We don't know what's in the lights. We've all looked through the lights. We've all seen the lights, they've changed us. We don't know, maybe the lights did it. Enough with the lights! Enough! MAN: U.S. forces have established multiple safe zones in the area. Secure transportation from these safe zones, government-fortified locations will be provided to any civilians requesting it. A convoy of transports will disembark to location designated Safe Zone Alpha at zero hundred hours midnight local time. The convoy will then proceed to the designated safe zone Bravo and Charlie. Departure time from Zone Bravo is oh-two hundred hours. Departure from Zone Charlie will be oh-four hundred hours. CQ, CQ, CQ. Does anyone read? MAN: Departure coordinates will immediately follow this message. Communication will repeat indefinitely on this frequency. (CLICKING) CQ, CQ, does anyone copy? MAN: CQ, CQ, CQ. Attention, this is a U.S. armed forces broadcast from Fort Benning, Georgia to surrounding localities. Damn it. MAN: Under direct order of the Pentagon, global authorities, National Guard, U.S. forces and- (DARK EERIE MUSIC) Just put back what you took out. I already told you I didn't take anything. Then where are the parts, Einstein? I don't know even if I had them. Look, it's a mess in here. The wires are stripped, hose is cut. It ain't moving. (ALISON CRIES) I'm so sorry I couldn't save you, Jessi. I love you. Always. You remember the lights to save your ass, but you forget the parts you stole from my SUV. Yeah, this memory loss seems a little too convenient for me. Fuck you, Derek. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) What, you gonna shoot me now, asshole? I don't need a gun - to prove a point, cocksucker. - God damnit, stop it! What is wrong with you? This isn't gonna solve anything. We have to work together from where we are with what we have. Are you calm? Yeah, I'm calm. Kevin, go get the map and bring it to the picnic table. Go, Kevin! Prick. God. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) We walk. We need to make it to Safe Zone Alpha by midnight. What's that? 13 miles? It's closer to 14. The average person walks four miles an hour. I could manage maybe three. Yeah, but that's on flat open ground, this is steep and the terrain gets really rough. Okay, let's say I average half that. What's that? Nine hours? Which still gets us to the deadline two hours past at the best. - Damn it. - Now, Safe Zone Bravo has a two a.m. deadline. It's further away but the terrain is a lot easier. Once we get outta the woods it's all sloping hills and old farm roads. DEREK: That's less cover. It'd leave us more exposed. Yeah, but we have a chance at making the deadline. It's gonna be really tight, but I think that we could do it if we leave within the next hour or so. Let's get walking then. DEREK: Alison and I will head for Safe Zone Bravo. You go for Alpha. What? No fucking way. What about the weirdos out there? You'll be fine, cottonballs. Ali, I thought we were putting this stuff behind us. We were gonna be family again. Kev, this is not punishment, it's- - It's redundancy. When the Alpha people get transferred to Bravo, if we're not there yet, you do everything you can to buy us extra time before the bus leaves. Like what, Gimpy? You could sabotage the engine. (CLOTHES RUSTLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PAPER RUSTLING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Ali? Coming. (LIGHT MUSIC) (DOOR CLICKING) - Al, it's- - Just give me a second. Okay? This plan is shit. It's the plan we have. I know he doesn't trust me. That's why he won't give me the shotgun. But I don't trust him, and neither should you. Why don't you come with me, we could- - Kev, don't. You don't trust me either. - Kevin, I haven't se- - No, it's fine. You should know that I remember Hanna. Sometimes. It's spotty like a TV with bad reception. I know that I didn't kill her, just like I know that I didn't sabotage the SUV. And if I didn't do it, then who did? (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) DEREK: Ali? Coming. What about Jessi? I honestly don't remember. Bye, Kev. This isn't goodbye, this is see you in a few. Right? Kevin. You be careful, okay? Yeah, you too. (LIGHT MUSIC) (BRANCHES RUSTLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Ali, wait up. (LEAVES RUSTLING) (HEAVY BREATHING) We were making pretty good time. I thought we could take a break. You've been quiet. I was just thinking about something Kevin said. About the lights. How's your leg? Could use some aspirin. There's some in that pack. ALISON: Car parts. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Babe. (GUN CLICKS) You ok- (GUN BANGING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ALISON GASPS) (GUN BANGING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Alison. (LEAVES RUSTLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ALISON GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ALISON PANTING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LEAVES RUSTLING) (TENSE MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ALISON SHRIEKS) (THUDDING) - (KEVIN GROANS) - Fuck, Ali. Holy shit. I heard a gun shot. Are you okay? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why, why, why? You murdered Derek. Probably Jessi, too! No, no, I was following you. I heard the gunshots, Ali. We have to be careful. The horde, we have to be quiet. You were supposed to be going the other direction. KEVIN: I didn't wanna leave him alone with you, Ali. I don't know what's real. The horde, they're real. We're gonna be okay. We just have to trust each other. Put the gun down. Yeah. We're family. You're lying. (LIGHT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Maybe, but that's the thing, Ali. Once you see the lights, really see the lights, the truth, it doesn't matter. So get that fucking gun out of my fucking face! We both know that you're not gonna pull- (GUN CLICKS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KEVIN LAUGHS) Oh, sis, I didn't think you had it in you. (ALISON GRUNTS) Oh, this is gonna be a lot messier now. You're my brother, Kevin. I don't wanna hurt you. (ALISON GRUNTS) That's the difference between you and me, Ali. I've wanted to hurt you for a very very long time. Even before the lights told me to. (ALISON GRUNTS) (THUDDING) (KEVIN GROANS) (ALI SHRIEKS) (KEVIN GROANS) (BOTH GROANING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ALISON GROANS) (KEVIN SCREAMS) (HORDE GROANING) (ALISON SIGHS) (KEVIN YELLS) (FLAME HISSING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Alison! Alis, you can't leave me like this! Alison, you always do the right thing! Not this time. Ali! Ali! Ali! (HEAVY BREATHING) (LIGHT MUSIC) (LEAVES RUSTLING) (ALISON GRUNTS) (ENGINE RUMBLING) (ALISON WHIMPERS) Oh god. Help, please. Alison? Is that you? Stella? Oh god, Stella. Jessi. Jessi.
