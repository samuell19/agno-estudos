[rain spattering] [thunder roaring] [dramatic music] [animal roaring] [intense drumming] [woman breathing heavily] [woman grunts] - You're a slave. Well slave or not, never throw a spear at me again. I'll cut your bloody throat. Now, pick those things up. Save your tears for your Angle master's burial. - Frythod was a pig. - You can talk. Good. Come. You'll help me bury him. [wind rustling] [metal clanking] [birds squawking] - Rome is so beautiful, and the monuments are ancient, and the Colosseum is spectacular. - Don't you miss Rome then? - Si, but I love it here. - It rains all the time. - Well, Uncle Fingal will bring the sun with him. - How did you meet Uncle Fingal? - He was a commander in Emperor Justin's army, and the Lombard's invaded. They brought the yellow plague with them. We had to flee and leave everything behind. - Uncle likes fighting? - He does. [man grunts] [screaming] - Ethne, run! [screams] [intense music] Run! - Ah, come on! - [Lillian] Run! [screams] Help! - Move! Move! [water burbling] - Psst. - Ethne, Ethne, go back. - No, I'm frightened. - Do as I say, go back and wait for your uncle. Mark the trail. They'll camp here for winter. Go! - They'll kill you! - No they won't. I think their leader wants me for himself. Go now! Fingal should be back soon, go! [breaths heavily] - You're the first Roman girl I've ever met. Good looking, well-mannered, educated. Should've seen some of the hacks we've catched in the past. Foul-mouthed, bad-mannered, disease-ridden, and ugly, unbelievably ugly. But you, you're the kind of woman a man wants to show off. - Ugh, do you like stories? - [Man] What kind of stories? - Stories about gods and demons and pillage and famine. - [Man] Can you tell stories like that? - Oh yeah, yeah. - [Man] Let's make a deal. When we make camp tonight, you tell me a story, and I'll make sure my men won't touch you. - Yes. - Ulph, get the men on their feet! [intense drumming] [rain splattering] [tense music] [wolf howling] - Why did you take time to bury them? - All warriors deserve a decent burial. - Why do you stare at me like that? - Like what? - Like I'm a Jew. - You've got me all wrong, woman. - You think I like being a slave? You're the fourth man in as many years to own me. - I don't own you. I don't even want you! But what would you do on your own out here? Hmm? Another Angle raiding party would capture you or a wild beast would eat you. - I can take care of myself. Give me a knife and a spear and I'll be gone by the morning. - Where would you go? - Far away from this miserable place. Maybe, maybe to Judea. - Judea. And what would you do there? - Visit the shrines of my ancestors. - It's all in ruins. - How do you know? - I've been through the holy land with the Roman army on the march to Africa. - You're a mercenary. - I'm a soldier for hire. [bottle pops] Is there anything wrong with that? - You plunder and pillage in the name of righteousness. - At least I don't eat dogs, horses, or wild monkeys like some of the heathens I've fought do. Or kiss little crude effigies or sacrifice children. I worship one god, the God, the same god you do. [sad music] ♪ Oh God, you are my God ♪ And I long after you - So what's your name? - Jessica. - You speak like a Saxon. - I was educated in Londinium. My father traded goods up and down the Germanic sea. Four years ago, his ship was seized and I was seized as a slave. - What happened to your father? - They killed him for his money. - I'm sorry. - I was sold at the market in Jorvik for a stolen horse. - I'd say it was a good horse. - I was passed as a camp follower by the north Umbrians. I learned to watch men kill each other and not get involved. - Heathens and Christians. - Is there a difference? Isn't one man much the same as any other? - You're wrong. You've been a slave too long. You need to be reeducated. [dramatic drumming] - [speaks foreign language] [men grunting] [men cheering] [man screaming] [bone cracking] [man screaming] [men cheering] [bone cracking] [dramatic music] [scream echoing] - This is your idea of freedom? Don't you trust me? - I stay alive by knowing what men are capable of doing and what women are capable of undoing. Feet. [mellow music] Night, sleep. - [Jessica] Where are you taking me? - To Caledon. I've given the best years of my life to fighting war for foreign armies. I've got to give a meaning to my life and my people. - What will you do with me when we get there? - Maybe a poor farmer will take pity on you and marry you. [scoffs] Aye, get some sleep. [mellow music] [bird chirping] Are you coming or what? We haven't got all day. The rain's about to come. - No. - [Fingal] Pick it up or else. - I will serve you, but you must let me wash. - Warrior approaching! That's no way to treat an old friend! - Fingal! - How you doing, you old fur trader? - And you, you old warthog. You should be dead by now, ha! - Aye! The Persians tried. And the Lombards have tried, and now the Angles, but I'm still here. - Who's the woman? - Ah, just another casualty of the chaos that exits everywhere. - Does she keep you warm at night? - [Fingal] I have a wife, Angwen. - My woman died last winter. Is she available. - I don't think she'd put up with your habits. Let her be. [birds chirping] - You have been married, girl? - So I exist to gather wood and leaves? To strike fire from flint so a man can enjoy the comfort of the hearth I've made. - That's a woman's work. A woman should obey her man. - Your Christ came to redeem women. A woman it was who bore him. A man who betrayed him with a kiss. Was it not woman who washed his feet with tears and a man who three times denied him, a woman who stood by his cross. No less than men do women possess this Earth. - Fiery-Tongued one she is. I'll buy her form you. - I told you to let her be. She's not for sale. - I'll give you a bearskin and three deerhides for her. - I told you, she's not for sale. - A present, from some monks. Let's keep talking. [tense music] - Gwyndol's druidic forces outnumbered us three to one, but they had one weakness. They wouldn't fight at night. And we were happy for the rest. Their army was colossal. [drumming] And we felt the morning would bring us our last day of glory. King Urion passed among us, [drumming] encouraging the wounded and blessing the dying. [men cheering] He spoke brave words about the courage and the valour of the cymrae on both sides. If the House of Cullin has to end, it is better that it destroys itself than all Brittania. He beseeched God to grant his victory over his wayward nephews who were obsessed with power and destruction. [men cheering] It was a great speech, and when it was over, we regrouped on a sandy howl at Arthuret. Dawn rose. And Gwyndol's forces streamed across the river and tried to take the howl. Thousands fell in the carnage and slaughter. In the midst of the battle stood Midren. Bring big distraction. He saw the end had come for his twin brother Gwyndol. The famous warriors of the cymrae all perished that day. [melancholy guitar music] Panshuin, with his battle axe struck off Gwyndol's head and paraded it on a spear for all to see. Midren went mad and rent his clothings. He smeared his face and body with Gwyndol's blood, but, on account that he was a holy man, he was allowed to stumble and flee from the battlefield to live out the test of his miserable days in the forests of Caledon. I was the one he carried Gwyndol's head on the spear. It was not a joy, sir. Only wailing for the 80,000 lost. - That many. I wish I'd seen that. - Too many. Too many to bury. The crows feasted on them. And now, our problems are with the Angles. But we're too weakened. - Angles are wily. They like to sneak up on a man. I bet you they sneaked up on her a few times. - I'm tired. [foreboding music] [drumming] [woman screaming] [man laughing] [woman laughing] - They boys are happy tonight. They have a roof over their heads, and they don't have to suffer Edwin's advances. - You're not going to protect her? - She's just a herdsman's wife. You told me your husband is a soldier, so you should understand our way of life. - Should I? Do you think my husband tells me everything that goes on on his campaigns? He's marked by his silence. - Perhaps he is an honourable man. - If you were an honourable man, you would protect her from your men. [laughing] - Ulph! Aelle. Not in front of the lady. Enough! You promised me a story. Edwin, take that cloak off. - I am Isis, all that has ever been, that is, or shall be. No mortal man has ever seen me unveiled. Crowned with the moon and clad in the robe of the stars. [laughing] [melancholy music] - Quickly, no more, little beauty. [drumming] Make it easy on yourself. [grunting] [metal clinking] [tranquil music] [mumbling] - Hey. Did you sleep well? - Yeah. What am I supposed to do with this? Wash or drink it? - Do as you please. - You think just because you bring me a bowl of water I'm gonna sleep with you? - [laughs] Don't embarrass me in front of my men. Ugh, ugh, Edwin, Hussa, Ulph, Aelle. Take her to the trees and do what you wish with her! - No! [speaks foreign language] No! [woman cries] - [Ulph] Bitch! - When you're finished, bury her! - No! - You will go to the stream, and you will prepare yourself! - You might as well kill me now! [woman screaming] - From now on, there'll be no special favours! One wrong look, and you're theirs. - No! [woman screaming] You bastard! - Don't tempt me, wench! - [Edwin] Ida! Ah! - [Ida] Be still boy, be still! - [Edwin] No, no, no! - [Ida] Be still! - No! - [Ida] Be still, be still! - I'm blinded! That bitch stuck a stick in my eye! - [Lillian] Good! - [Ida] Be quiet! [Edwin wails] - Get up, I said. Get up, I said. That's an order! It's the witch's doing. Get back to the fire. All of you! I want the camp cleared now! [wind whistling] - The Angles have killed my brother. I will not rest until every one of them is buried. - [Ida] You two look tired. - There's a large tower about half a day's march from here. - How many? - Maybe as many as 20, 25, all living in one big hall. The hall is built on stilts and pushes out onto the lake. There's a short wooden causeway that connects the hall to the shore. - You think we could take it and hold it for winter? - Easily. We only saw about four or five old men. There rest are women and children. - Get some rest. We'll move out when this cloud breaks. [birds chirping] [Ethne screaming] [Fingal shushing] [fire crackling] - This is my niece Ethne. Don't be afraid. She's just a slave I freed along the way. Ethne. You'll come with me and carry my weapons. - She's a child. Leave her behind with your people. I'll go in her place. - Why would you do that? - So you have something to trade for your wife. This is not my country. I could never be happy here. At least with the Angles I have a chance of escaping back to Londinium. - What if they don't want you? - Oh, they'll want me. Ethne. Was one of them as tall as a tree, and one of them couldn't speak? - Do you know them? - They're Frythold's cousins. They came to this country together. Ida, their leader, has been trying to bed me for the last two years. Angles live for sport. They know someone'll come after them to trade for their hostages. They're counting on it. I know how to please soldiers when they're far from home. But it's gonna cost more than me. You have to take coins and spoil. - If that's the way it's to be, then so be it. But don't expect me or Ethne to be grateful. You're every bit one of them. [tranquil music] - You'd make a good father. - I'm a soldier, lady. - Maybe it's time you became a farmer. - With savages intent on robbery? - Well. Treat a dog badly and it will bite you. - I don't need any of your Eastern talk. Angles will not be happy until they've taken all our land. - Why don't you share it with them? - And be made slaves? Our people are free, and we will fight for our freedom. Just as your people have fought since Moses' time. - That's man's talk. What about the girl's future. Where's her mother? - She died of the yellow plague. - [Jessica] The plague came as far as this distant place? - There's no hiding from something that is carried in the wind. In this land, you will see the work of many, but the land is bare of people now. The Angles are constantly reinforced with fresh immigrants. To defeat them, our scales must fall on ten men. I'm most valuable as a warrior, to fight those who oppose my people. - You're not driven by self-interest and revenge like all other men? - I live by a code of honour. If I did not live by that code, you'd be dead, aye. Get some sleep. [tense music] - Fesh Cuma, fesh cuma, we come as friends. It is Fingal, brother of Dougal! I have his daughter here, he's been killed by the Angles. - You're not welcome here, Fingal! - Roderick, the civil war is over! At least show us some Celtic hospitality. [ethereal music] - [Roderick] I lost three sons in the war. - [Jessica] You can't blame the soldier for that, Chief. - [Roderick] I've seen nothing in him that impresses me. - Why do you despise him so much? - He's the father of my granddaughter. - [Jessica] But she calls him uncle! - She doesn't know. He went to war and left my daughter pregnant. His brother married her and raised the child as his own. - Does he know this? - No. He was gone eight years and returned with a Roman wife. She brought the yellow plague with her. It destroyed our way of life. The Angles can do what they please with her. It is the will of God. - So will you not help him to get her back. - If God is good, God will help him. - I pity you people. You are bitter and divided. With your little secrets, you're no match for the Angles. - The Angles will never come in sufficient numbers to defeat us. - You are so wrong, Chief. I have seen their keels. They hold 40 men. They come every day from Denmark and Germania. They are organised and hungry for land. - The spirits of our ancestors would protect us. - Your spirits have not helped you up to now, Chief. I think it is wise to enlist Fingal on your side. It's time to settle your differences. - You're a strange being. You sound like a woman, yet talk like a man. - Make no mistake, Chief, I am a woman. [intense drumming] - [Man] Angles! - Is that them? - Yes. It's Ida and his brother Aelle. - How many are in their band? - He has four other half-brothers. They'll be hiding somewhere in the trees. - You still willing to be traded? - Yes. - What do you want? - We've come to talk to your chief. - I'll do the talking. - We want food and tributes, or we will kill everyone. - You won't kill one of your own, would you? - That's cousin Frythold's woman. - Your comrades are dead! - Leave this to me. What do you want for her? - Any of our women you have. - Trade the Roman witch and be rid of her, and we can come back and slaughter them all. - We don't have any of your women. But if you give her up, we will go away in peace. - You'll have to come and get her. - What are we gonna do now? - Shut it, Aelle. This Celt's a fool. - If you don't hand her over, we'll set fire to your hall. - Come now, lads. Leave the civilians out of this. We are fighting men. I'll fight your champion. If he wins, you can have her. If not, give us what hostages you have and leave our land. - I told you this Celt is a fool. You will fight our champion Aethelric. My men will prepare the ground. Make sure the Roman is bound and kept hidden until after the match. - Aethelric has never lost. - There's a first time for everything. [dramatic drumming] - There'll be no punching, kicking, or gouging. First to two falls, wins. To the death! - [Angle Man] Come on, Aethelric! - [Angle Man] Aethelric! - [Angle Man] Come on! - [Angle Man] Aethelric! [men cheer] - [Angle Man] Come on! - First fall to our man. - [Angles] Yes! - Aethelric! [men cheering] [Aethelric grunts] - [Angle Man] That's it, boy! [grunting] [men cheering] [grunting] [men cheering] [grunting] [bone snapping] [Fingal groans] - Where is your honour? You lost the match! - [Ulph] What are we doing here, Ida? - [Ida] Let him have it, Ulph. - [Jessica] Give him his wife! - [Ida] Pull in your spears, men! - Fingal! - Look lads, it's her soldier man. - He won the fight fair and square. - I'm a fair man. Which one do you want, Celt? The Roman or the Jew? - You're a long way from home. - Give back the witch, Ida. She's been enough trouble already. - Quiet Ulph! I'm sorry friend, but I can't let you have both. I need one of them to keep me warm this winter. - Give him his wife or I'll charge you with falsehood, light seven candles, and heap the curses of your gods upon you. - Oh, I like a bit of spirit. And you will go with me freely? - Yes. - Then it is settled. We will wait in the trees until dusk. Bring whatever food and tribute you have. And your pretty wife will be returned to you. You have my word. Move out! [sad music] - We have made our bargain. Now give me my wife! - Hussa, give him the Roman. [Lillian grunts] - [Ulph] Wench! Wench. Bloody wench. - [Angle Man] Roman bitch! [spear whistling] - Lillian! [sad music] [Fingal sobbing] - I'm sorry. I've always brought you bad luck, didn't I? - I've never been here. I've always been at war. - Oh, it's not that. Since I married you. everything is going dark. I'm dying! I'm dying! [breathing heavily] You've made me happy, very happy. I love you. I think I. [sad music] [intense drumming] - [Ida] Ulph! You have undone my word! - Coming at her, she's already cost us. [Ida grunts] - It's over! She's dead! - [Ida] Later. [sad music] - How are you, son? - Where's God now? - It is evil they have done. - I never truly loved her the way she loved me. Even in death. She never cursed me. - You must sit with the living. How are your wounds? - Well enough. - We have spoken and agreed you must liberate the Jew. - Why? - She is pure of spirit. She showed us that she is prepared to sacrifice her freedom for you. It is your creed to fight slavery where you see it. It is your duty as a warrior to liberate her. These Angles must pay for their treachery. Now that I have seen their ways, I believe that we shall all die at their hands if we do not fight. - I'm only one man. - We have a gift that will give you the strength of 10. - This is the sword of the great chief Kaneda. He died when you were a boy. He entrusted it to me and bade me keep it, until the day our people find a warrior who will lead them wisely into the future. - I am not that man. - If you are not that man, then the gods have deserted [speaks foreign language]. - Let it be none, there is only one god. It is a god of our own saint Nanyu. And only He that we shall worship. - It is agreed. - Then in the name of God. I will be your warrior. [birds chirping] - I have something to say to you. - Grandfather Roderick told me. - Told you what? - That I will stay with him if you don't return. - I will return. - Will you be a good father to me? - I'll be the best father in all Caledon. - I love you. - I love you too, Ethne. - Mama told me you were my papa before she died. - Aye, aye. - If you find Jessica, can she stay with us, too. - We'll see. - The Angles were seen yesterday heading for the high country. - Without a guide, they won't find a way across the mountains. I'll catch them. - Take this. You may need it to buy some friends. - Ethne. You take care of your grandfather. [melancholy music] [upbeat music] [laughing] [paper tearing] - How much is it worth? - They're Christian. It's worth its weight in coin. - I'll buy me a dress. - So we're just gonna let them go. - They're lost. We'll pick them off one by one. [dark music] [ethereal music] - It's impossible to get a bearing in this land. It's always cloudy. - Maybe it'll clear tonight and we can see the stars. - When are we going home? - Shut up, Edwin. I'm tired of your moaning. I wish you were a mute like Hussa. - Get her to get some wood for the fire. We'll camp here tonight. - This place is wide open. Fire'll be seen for miles. We should make camp in them trees. - Haven't you noticed? We're being followed. Three of them. I saw 'em this morning. - Celts? - Picts. - Picts? That means we're going north, not south. - Edwin's right, Ida. What's the sport in this? - If we march northwards another few days, then strike east, in three days we'll reach the German Sea. - Then what? - We'll commandeer a boat and sail home. - Just like that? - Look, we're short on numbers. If Frythold hadn't been killed, we wouldn't be in this position. - You shouldn't have let that Celt fight Aethelric. - Edwin's right, Ida. We should've taken that whore and settled there for Winter. It would've been easy to defend. - You said it was easy to take. A few old men and the rest women and children [laughs]. - The Celt must've shown up later. - Enough! We are warriors. Woden is testing our courage. - We're going to the hidden world. - Shut up, Edwin! You're a disgrace to our family. - [Ida] Hussa, you'll take the first watch. [upbeat music] - Don't get up. I've come to join you. - He's one. - Are you a Christian? - Why, you want a bedtime story? - She wants a new dress. - How much would you give us for this? - Where'd you get that? - Pay us for it, and we'll tell you. - I'm all out of trust these days. Why don't you just tell me? - Her mother left it to her when she died. [laughs] - Pull the other one. You stole it. - Ah, I did not. He did. - I did not, you hag. The cyclops threw it away. - Where was this? - Half a day back that way. - That way? - No, they've been running in circles for two days now. They're actually camped up that way, in the open. - Can you guide me? - It'll cost you. - You still haven't bought the book. - Lead me to their camp, and I'll give you all the coin I have. - Why don't we take his coin and keep the book? - I wouldn't try it. I'm sure you are pretty handy with those weapons. But I warn you, you're no match for me. Why don't you just point me in the direction the Angles are camped? Thank you. [laughing] [tranquil music] - Get the fire going, girl. - My name's Jessica. - I know your name. - You soldiers are all the same. No manners. - Aye, that's what the wife says. But I wouldn't dare kick her out of bed. You've met my wife, Frida. - Yes, she's as fat as a pig. - Why do you think I'm away so much. Tell me, girl. Why did you save the Celt from being killed? - He spared my life. Now we're even. - You should've let us kill him. - He's the best fighter I've ever seen. - Better than me? - Yes. - Why didn't he kill you when he captured you? - He needed someone to carry his war tribute. - He had some fine things. Here, take this. - I can't. - This was meant for the dead woman. - It's yours. When we make camp tonight, you can wear it and dance for me. - When are we getting out of here? This place gives me the chills. [sad music] [upbeat Celtic music] [screaming] - Where's Edwin? - He'll catch up. - Hussa, go back and help Edwin with his load. Here, take this. [laughing] [foreboding music] - Hussa! - [Ida] Edwin. - It's Picts! They use axes! - Get yourself together, Aelle. - Shut it, Ida! You're leading us to our deaths. - He's right, Ida. This is grim. I'm going back the way we came. Aelle, Hussa. I don't see anything. - [Aelle] He's not making sense. - Whatever it is, he doesn't wanna go that way. - It's the Celt, isn't it Hussa? - [Jessica] He's pursuing us. - [Ida] That's all we need. - [Ulph] How far to the ocean? - [Ida] That'd be two days. - Can we slow him up? - We'll set some traps along the way. Come, let's move. And stay together. Move out! [upbeat Celtic music] [fire crackling] - Don't get up. - What do you want? - First, you can start by handing over my dress and jewels. - They're mine. - You can hand them over or I can tan your backside. - Are you gonna let him talk to me like that? - Hey, oh ho! I've been wanting to do that for a long time now. Give him the dress back, sweetums. [Pict woman crying] - [Pict Woman] You can have your dress. - You're gonna help me catch the Angles. - It'll cost ya. - Chief, we're hired. [foreboding music] - [Cole] I've even recited to kings. - Aye, dead ones. He talks to the stones, you know. [Fingal laughs] - [Pict Woman] He only humours him because he's my younger brother. - I'm older than him! - He is not! - And I've got more teeth than you. - He has not. - [Fingal] Cole. - What? - Trees are bent. We'll go around this place. - Don't be cuckoo. If we go around that way, it's gonna put half a day out of our way. Ugh, there's nothing to be afraid of. I know the way. [low thudding] [screaming] - Stay back! The whole way is rigged. - We can't leave him there for the crows. - It's not always possible to bury the slain. Show me a way around this place. [sad music] The girl is helping us. - [Pict Man] Where are they headed? - Don't ask me. - [Pict Man] They must be headed for somewhere. - Back across the sea, I hope. - The sea. Of course. - How much time did we lose by going around the traps? - A quarter sun. If they've headed back across the moor, you'll never find them among the mists of the high peaks. - They cannot be travelling as fast as us. They must be in sight. Come on, get yourselves up. - You're a hard man, mister. - You think the traps got him? - Nah. - Why are we so scared of him? - There's four of us. - He's the hunter. We're the prey. - So why don't we hunt him and be done with it. - I'm for that! Hussa? - He'll kill you all. - Shut it, Jessica. Maybe you're right, Aelle. I'm sick of looking over me shoulder. - That's more like it, Ida! - Yeah. We'll string him up. We owe him that for Aethelric. - We'll need some bait. - What? - We go a job for you. - This is far as we go. - We go no farther. - Thank you. - [Pict Woman] Let's go and bury my brother. [bird screeching] [upbeat drum music] [men grunting] - [Ulph] Admit it, Ida. We lost. - [Ida] I won't give in. We'll reach the sea. - [Ulph] We're in a bad way. - We'll make it. Once over these mountains, we'll see the sea. - You better be right, Ida. Or I'm gonna kill ya. - What's the matter with you, Ulph? Since we've started this raid, you've been at my throat. - I'm getting too old for this, Ida. Why don't we settle down and pay others to fight for us? - [Ida] We'd be sending them out to die. If the Celts didn't kill them, the land would. - [Ulph] Look at us. And what're we gonna do with her? - We'll let her go when we reach the sea. That Celt! He doesn't know when to give up. Come on, let's lose him in the clouds. [melancholy music] ♪ The grass and mountains I have seen ♪ ♪ Sights beyond my wildest dreams ♪ ♪ Beyond the valleys there's a place I call home ♪ ♪ Where I ♪ Where I ♪ Where I feel so un-alone ♪ Where I feel so un-alone ♪ Un-Alone - Where's the sea then, Ida? - [Ida] It's gotta be somewhere. - There's nothing but more mountains! [Ida grunting] - [Ida] Don't do this. - Take your sword out. I'm gonna kill ya. [grunts] - [Ida] You can't beat me. You never will. - [Aelle] Ida, Ulph! [groans] - Hussa, stop 'em! [grunting] - Woden! [fighters grunting] - Come on, get it on with. - To the death. [grunting] Die! You shouldn't have killed her, little brother. [both scream] [breathes heavily] Anyone else? Aelle? Hussa? What's the matter with you all? Have you nothing to say? I just killed our brother. You. You think I'm a fool. - I think nothing. - I am a fool. I'm going down this mountain to find the sea. You can all rot here with Ulph. - Ida! Ida! [ethereal music] [water burbling] - Ah, I'm slowing you down. I'm not gonna make it. - Don't talk that way, Aelle. Let me rest, Ida. - We must keep moving. - I know, it's bad. Give me an axe and a spear. - No Aelle. I'm not leaving you. - Can't you see he's dying. - What do you care? - Each man should be allowed his own way to go to heaven. - Right Ida. At least let me die like a warrior. - Go now. I will wait for the Celt. [tranquil music] Wounded by war. Worn by wounding. High in the hills, hankering for home. Wrestled from women, wrenched from wenching. The weary warrior stands alone. Blooded by battle, axe blade broken, spear shaft smashed, helmet hewn. Chanting war cries, stirring the sleeping. The warrior waits, bereft of blood. Thirsty for fighting, hungry for hunting, slinging of shields, singing of swords, proud in his posture, brave in his bearing. The warrior relishes fighting his foes. [screams] [intense drumming] - What took you so long, Celt? The gods are waiting for me. - Well they won't have much longer to wait. [grunting] [metal clanking] [tranquil music] - Get up, girl. - I can't go any further. - Look. We have one chance. - What have I got to live for? - Another 20 years of slavery? - Look, I will free you. I will desert my pig of a wife. Marry you. [Jessica laughs] [metal clanking] - What's wrong? - It's not the Germanic Sea. - Well what sea is it? - It must be the western ocean. [Jessica laughs] - So we've been travelling the wrong way all this time? Oh, you're some leader, Ida. - Quiet! We can still steal a small boat and sail northwards round to the Germanic Sea. - In Winter? You'll drown us all. Give up, Ida, you're beaten. Maybe they'll spare you and hold you in chains until you're ransomed. - After what Ulph did to the Roman? - What about him? What does he think? - Well Hussa, what should we do? - [laughs] Angles are men of the sea! Isn't that right, Hussa? Yeah, let's move out. Move it! [dark music] [intense drumming] Let's go! I've waited a long time for this. Woden! - Aye, prepare to meet your god Angle. [metal clanking] [Ida groans] [metal clanking] - No! Hussa. [metal clinking] [Ida groans] - [Fingal] Your gods spare you, Angle. - You're a strange man. - What do I do with you now? - Free me? - And let you go to Judea? - If you wish. - I brought this for my wife. I want you to have it. - I couldn't wear that. - Then all this has been for nothing.
