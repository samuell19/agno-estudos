In the 18th century philosopher Diderot and his friends wrote the first encyclopedia in the entire history of mankind It met with recognition from the public, despite criticism from authorities and Church and became a precursor to the French Revolution of 1789 Shortly after, censorship suppressed the book, but it was impossible to annihilate it. We wouldn't be free, if the word "freedom" hadn't been invented! Sentimental words are often whispered to me, Endearments are given to me very often, I like dear words very much And I like endearments too, But what is better: endearments or words? I'd prefer words! Because endearments are hiding behind the words I choose words because I don't want only endearments I choose words because I don't want only endearments How dare you! - King's police The encyclopedia, which you're publishing with Diderot, is banned! I already know that So, how can you explain that it is still being passed around? The printery has been closed, the pressrun was withdrawn, but the book is still secretly speading, even abroad! Isn't is strange? It is. But you can't stop progress THE LIBERTINE Here is a clandestine printery! Search through the castle! Where is Diderot? Where is Diderot? Where is Diderot? I don't know captain. I was praying Sorry, madame Keep looking! We shall find him Monsieur Diderot... It's unreasonable... Wonderful I know nothing better You tell the same to everyone But... Didn't your cousin like me, did she not? Stop spreading such gossip! I'm not spreading. We are alone Nevertheless, did your cousin like me? Do you want me to say "yes"? - Yes Well... Yes To please you Cloe, darling... Monsieur Diderot, do you know my cousin? By hearsay My lovely husband - Where have you been my darling? Monsieur Diderot tried to introduce some philosophy into my poor head Your head was fine today And? And... He is very talented Clandestine printery in a mansion! Did we really scare them so much? Friends, let's go have a dinner They left Paul, give us something to drink They cannot do anything to us, until they find the printery We will rest in prison Sometimes it feels like I'm already in prison Light will spread from this cellar, Abraham Intellect from this cellar will beat superstition Nothing, madame. A wild piglet was unlucky It was too slow It is still breathing It is suffering Madame Therbouche! Excuse me for my morning dress We were expecting you yesterday - I was unwell Nothing serious, I hope - Nothing You charmed everyone here. De Lambert, madame Lepinas... Attention please, try this What is this? - Chocolate Choco-what? Do you want to poison me with this black dirt? It's wonderful, believe me Even though it looks like shit, it tastes completely different Is it a remedy? Too exotic for you. Chocolate has no future in France, obviously But my doctor recommended me chocolate in tablets and bars, as much as I want It awakens sensuality Lokum. From Turkey - No, thank you Enough. Hurry up We're going to swim To swim? What for? Do you want him to be a sailor? I want him to be a Man I always thought that to be a man, one needs a penis rather than fins Do you hear pig squeak? That's we, probably I can distinguish human's voice from pig's You are lucky Madame Therbouche is right That is my new invention Friends, this is Madame Therbouche A very talented artist from Prussia De Lambert recommended her to paint Diderot's portrait Take courage Diderot can't sit still I'd advise you stun him before each sitting Do speak bad about me? - Not yet. You came too early I guess, you are my model Yes, but don't model my ways It is risky? - You can risk Do you remember me? I'm your wife F-sharp is missing! Let me introduce a new musical instrument pig organ A pig's squeal depends on its size and weight, so we can get a note. Are you sure it's F-sharp? Only on an empty stomach, monsieur Let me play "Moonlight" on pig organ When can we start? In one hour, in the gallery Eat, this is from Turkey I do like F-sharp What is there? Earthquake or another invention of your daddy? That's the Encyclopedia, mother The steps of the progress Why is the progress always walking so loudly? Monsieur Diderot, I so wanted to paint your portrait Seat there Look at me I like philosophy You'd better like philosophers Nonsense: Socrates wasn't handsome And as I was told, he had a defect He liked men He was lost for women And women are losing me I don't have ancient character I like to take clothes off instead of put them on Don't change your face expression I can't catch it I should tell you something Yes? Something is wrong. You are here, I'm there We're going the wrong way It is not what I wanted - What did you want? I don't like this pose - No problems We should go much further - Much further? Then go, I will follow you I'd like to respect the nature and find innocence Let's listen to nature I'd like to do with you something that I've never done with Monsieur Voltaire Voltaire hasn't been able to do that for a while I'd like to paint you... nude What? Nude, as any other artist's model to let the world see you like the nature created you Philosophy and science create philosophers It will be a unique picture So sincere: a philosopher that is real Well, I don't know... My books are quite straightforward Please monsieur Diderot: nude philosophy What if something happens to me? - For example? To be like that in front of you... - And? You are quite pretty I was mistaken I read your books, I admired you I thought that you are the only man in Europe who can step over the conventionalities who can be unsophisticated. Like Adam before the Fall I was silly Wait! So, I'm undressing and sitting down, right? Yes, right I adore you, Monsieur Diderot Such a steadfast soul! To notice that you needed me to take my pants off You are beautiful I know... my soul is No, your body - Hush up Talk to me like to a stil life Why do you not look at me? Look at me After Adam's fall, not all parts of the body are under our control I don't know theology, and want you to look at me For the sake of philosophy Ohh, Monsieur Diderot Growing expression of my steadfast soul Don't be afraid, I'm not that steadfast like him Let's come to an agreement: I'll put you on my canvas Only if I put you in my bed - After A carriage! Oh, God! My brother I don't believe my eyes. My brother is here! - The one who's wearing soutane? Yes, that's him Stop working - Stop, everybody stop What a nice surprise, brother Brother, you're like a father to me My dear, it seems like you dont observe the fast, as usual I like everything that God created I'm going from Paris to Avignon I'd like to spend a few days here Abbot, the chest Wonderful A very nice idea We can't think of anything better Go F-sharp A catastrophe! Cardinal came We had to stop printing to not make noise And now Baronne can't finish his article about morals Continue printing But the noise... You will override it by playing organ I play harpsichord only Play organ somehow. And I'll finish the article I thought that the encyclopedia is banned and arrested Do you really stand for freedom? I don't know if I believe in freedom Maybe we are only controlled by nature See, I was posing, now I'm writing, but... I'm a man, you're a woman and I'm nude Our mechanisms want to join Open! It's me! My wife Only one person can say "It's me" so earnestly - my wife! You are not alone, of course - Alone In such dress - Why not? I'm not expecting anyone Tell me the truth Doubts are much more delightful than the truth There is no woman in France that is deceived more than me It's over. I'm taking our daughter And we are going to Paris Toinette, wait! Why now? It has lasted for years What? I have been philandering for 20 years, and today I decided to become reasonable Do you despise me so much? No! Don't I love you anymore? Tell me! It's disgusting! When we are together, you're thinking of other women Never! Really? - Never! I would think of them, if I didn't have them But I come to you after them... Promise me to put an end to it No, it would be unnatural Continence, like a diet, brings health Never! I've crossed fidelity off the list of virtues Do you hear this strange noise? Which noise? Yes, it's cold. Going back? Don't you hear? - No, I don't A strange noise - Do you hear something? Very strange. Let's go You were right Somebody is playing music I told you! He has good hearing So good, so I hear voices that you don't hear God's voice, for example How about free spirit? I feel queasy! - She feels queasy! Take the pig, please I need fresh air! Abbot, take the pig. And don't forget my umbrella I feel better I hope you don't communicate with those horrible philosophers and materialists De Lambert, Helvetius, Diderot... We severed all relationships with them long time ago Diderot is a Devil's servant We already have banned his encyclopedia I would not recognize Diderot if I met him Darling, a man can't retain all those body fluids Otherwise they will get into the head, and he will become stupid How about monks? I think they have fun with each other Why deny such a nice and necessary thing? Go away with your pig, leave me alone It is like bloodletting, but much more enjoyable - Ohh, no! The nature doesn't like useless things We shouldn't conflict with nature, we should follow it Brother... - Give him smelling salts Sister... We are married, did you forget? Marriage is flagrant violation of laws of nature Lusts tear me apart I'm the centre of the force that created me and overfills me What did you give him? Your invention that we use in bed Sister... stay with me Nice words said by a swine! I am who I am. Nothing else Nothing can be against nature or beyond nature Philosophers don't look like this. You don't have any morals! I have morals. But for me, morals mean for art to be happy An idea! This is what I'll write "Everybody is looking for happiness. And there is the only dream - to be happy, The only duty - to be happy With one woman, With thousands women...! Enough, enough Do not overdo it God created me like this God is not responsible for all the horrors that he sees on the Earth. I'm leaving To Avignon? To my room! Abbot, come here! Don't catch a cold Abbot! Umbrella, pig. Come! Cardinal could baptize you like this I'm sure it's him who sent police here last evening They left with nothing, so he came today to nose about everything While he hasn't found the printery, he can't accuse us of anything He's dreaming to see us in jail What can we do? Arrange a hunt - Do you think so? It will keep men busy, bring food for women, and if we are lucky enough, we'll get rid of a little problem This pig is ill-mannered a copy of baroness Open the door! What are you waiting for? Madame Therbouche What are you doing here? - Questioning myself Don't do it here The Church won't help you with the answer Are you in troubles? - Yes With your wife? - Yes She wants to leave to Paris with my daughter And what? - Nothing Monsieur Diderot, show me your secret I think you already know all of me A secret becomes more important when it is shared She's a friend This is the printery Here are two presses She's a friend I never trust women - Pity Women always bring bad things All, except your mother Is this young boy indifferent to women too? No, unfortunately for me, he has very broad preferences Thanks to Madame Diderot for this article: Morales are for art to be happy I don't want hunting, I want to pray in the chapel He doesn't want hunting, he wants to go to the chapel - Damn! He will discover us Holy Father, I need to confess You??? - Yes, here Here? Now? - Yes, now Can't you wait? - Not a second! Bless me Father, for I have sinned Are you going to hunt? - I'm pursuing another game Madame Therbouche Where is Cardinal? Don't worry. He is in baroness' hands What about "Morales" article? - Finished. I'll reread it and that's it Are you allright? - Yes, yes Is your cousin here? - No... "Our Father" two times, "Hail Mary" three times. And God will forgive you Father, wait. This is not all I'm listening - At night, when my husband falls asleep, I'm up Pardon? - I'm up I know that he is here Who? - He is waiting for me I can't help, and I'm not ashamed Last night again... Again... - Again... What's happened? Tell me, my child Ham. 12 pounds All 12 pounds? - Yes Yes, only bones were left "Our Father" three times, "Hail Mary" fifteen times. And God will forgive you Wait... What else? Then I bury bones. I pay servants for their silence I'm sinful. I'm so sinful... Repeat: Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. Vade in pace, my daughter Monsieur Diderot! - I don't have time I need to tell you something - Yes About a girl that found a wonderful man Courageous, with beautiful soul and body And? I'd like to tell him: Monsieur, I don't respect anyone as much as you I don't love you, and never will Don't worry about it. I just want your baby Please, give me a particle of life We probably can investigate this matter - Make haste! We will talk - Discuss details Consider difficulties - And write everything on paper What for? My friend needs it She needs evidence that her womb belongs to her and everything that is conceived in there I'd advise that girl to listen to her heart because... because nature is always right Here. Are you satisfied? Angelique! Papa Angelique, what are you doing here? I couldn?t dare to ask you myself I love Jerfeuil But he is only 10 years old His father - Chevalier? He is older than me! I like your conversation. Lots to learn from Get out! I don't want you to sleep with that disgusting Jerfeuil who likes only his horses and swimming Who can't read philosophic books withiout yawning I don't want to dandle little Jerfeuil But I want to! You said: nature is always right! Why can't you wait till you love a coeval and marry him after? Because you are against marriage But... I... I... Marriage is necessary for humans I'm not persuaded Angelique, you don't listen to me! I always persuade everyone. Where are you going? To Jerfeuil. I'll think there What's happened, Monsieur Diderot I've made a mistake The Encyclopedia should help fathers Three chicken, two piglets, and icecream, not very fresh but I still ate it "Our Father", "Hail Mary" And God will forgive you Wait, Father! It is not all Something else? - The worst thing Do you remember that accident on our wedding? Prosphora? - Yes 500 prosphora disappeared I almost died of shame Wedding without prosphora! It's terrible That was me... at night I had a melancholy seizure. One moment and... 500 prosphora. It's terrible Only when I finish - Show me Artists don't show their unfinished paintings Go, undress quickly! My portrait, my portrait... Do you want the portrait or the model? If a storm comes into this gallery, what will you rescue? Me or the picture? The wind You will be my second philosopher I painted Voltaire Just a portrait? No. I did more And? That is a snowy lover He thaws in hands I don't indulge in illusions about myself, I won't leave any marks in history Why? - Because I feel better in bed than at a table Have you finished your article? - Yes And I added some things to it after conversation with my daughter I defined more exactly that the only duty of man is to procreate To follow nature's law, and, therefore, the law of human society Strange, isn't it? You vindicate personal pleasure in front of your wife, and refuse the pleasure in sake of the common good in front of your daughter Is it a contradiction? - Looks like that Isn't morality contradictory? Then there are two moralities, instead of one Morality of an individual and morality of society One is anarchic, another is conservative And they have nothing in common - That's annoying What's happened monsieur? - I need to improve something You don't have much time to achieve a success Perfection and me have been separated long time ago Go, play organ! And that wine... That is not a sin. God drank wine too Not that much to not get to his bedroom Father, last night I spread your brother's body with honey and licked it all the night Leave me alone, I don't want to listen to you anymore It's a torture. I don't deserve it Then I went to sleep when exhausted And I saw you in my dream You were made of sugar, and I licked you all over Do you want to know where I started? Leave me, I'm going to pray in the chapel! Father! - Leave me alone!! I need to pray after all these horrors Too late. It's dinner time Let's go to eat Papa, I'm cold - Don't be like a girl Listen to daddy my darling, then you'll be like him Have a nice meal - Thank you Excuse me, pardon... Of course, Monsieur Diderot, you came after the prayer on purpose Of course I did What is this muck? - It's caviar, mum Cavi-what? - Caviar. Fish eggs Fish? Looks like birds dung The food bores me Who is this Therbouche? Madame Therbouche is an artist from Berlin, she decided to move to Paris I'm a patron of art, I like to help talents You help vagabonds Oh, my brother... - Pardon... Therbouche? Look at my daughter. She fell in love with Chevalier de Jerfeuil Does it bother you? She wants his baby I don't think there is anything to worry about Jerfeuil is lost for women - He?? But he is married He is not the first, nor the last like that Moreover, his wife is not satisfied. She is looking for anyone to grasp by the cock Even if a victim doesn't have one How do you know? I observe Look at Jerfeuil: he is always agreeing with marquis Always looking at his collar, as he is guessing the shape of his body And he doesn't show his teeth when he is laughing, as a man who hides his vices How to recognize a woman who hides her virtues? Which vertues? Compassion on a wounded animal, for example Trust me, your Jerfeuil is like marquis The only difference is that he will never admit it I'd like to offer you pineapple for desert Pine-what? So, to save my daughter from Jerfeuil, You just need to expose him Let us to laugh with you, Monsieur Diderot Well, Madame Therbouche and I are talking about sodomy I don't want to talk about it, especially during the meal There is a punishment of eternal fire for this sin At least it is not so silly as solo pleasure If we are talking about sensuality, I think it is better to have it with someone else than alone God ordered us to share If you share a sin, you'll get two sinners instead of one Sinner! How terribly you name generosity When one man joins with another man, it is only altruistic masturbation Monsieur Diderot grants honours to masturbation! These are morals of your Encyclopedia Did you read it Monsieur Cardinal? Encyclopedia grants honour to pleasure Do you think that God cares about your pleasure? God! hates! pleasure! Why he created it then? It is a trap! A trap to induce men and women to procreate I think that a man has no vices or perversions, he just spoils his health and is guilty only when he hurts his body I, I, I! Stop putting your "I" in the beginning, middle and end of all your phrases I'm speaking for myself according my conscience And, at least, unlike you, I don't give my words out to be God's orders You are a libertine! I accept your compliment If this word means an ability to differ sex and love, coition and union To be a libertine means to feel nuance and to be exact By the way, Monsieur de Jerfeuil, did you see marquis' collection of swords? How?? Do you collect swords? It's hard to believe I collect them too! One of them is especially wonderful In the dark red sheath, the blade is thin and sharp Marquis has the best collection in Ile-de-France Will you show me? - What? Your swords - Whenever you like So delightful... Please serve Strange, but it's very tasty What is it? Meat This is F-sharp F-what? - F-sharp My darling... Strange, but it tastes like pork I'll read it and come back Continue, Abraham I don't know what else to play. I have only indecent songs left You can play them, just do it solemnly Move your legs quicker Hurry up my cousin Come to me Hurry up my cousin Usually Marquis licks me But when he is absent But when he goes somewhere Cousin licks me instead of him Cousin licks me instead of him What is this? My secret garden My fabulous mushrooms What's going on in the chapel? I thought it's neglected Chapel of your forefathers is neglected?! Never! What is being played? - Gloria Father - What else? I'm unhappy - Why, my daughter? Your brother harmed me because of F-sharp - Piglet? I didn't realise that he will react that way when he found out What? Baronne created a nice little choir And what did you do? I slaughtered all the orchestra And made sausages A sausage symphony I couldn't resist - Of course Those little tails and pink legs were so attractive And I made sausages of them. I'm a monster How can I believe in God, if people like me exist Yes, it's a difficult question In case of a conflict between an individual and society, society should win, and the individual should sacrifice themself Is it your conclusion? Yes. Mankind is always mankind Life should continue So, you reject abortion? - Pardon? You blame a woman which frees herself from a child, which has no time, no bravery and no money to rear an accidentally made child, which hates the man and the circumstances that put the child in her body, when her belly only keeps bad memories You are like the priests who you dislike And treat a woman like a womb for a man and mankid I don't know any woman who was happy after abortion Of course! And? But I don't blame her. I feel sorry for her, because she didn't have any space for love and a new life in her life You speak beautiful words, you should write it down Did it hurt you? Write about it Certainly you should write Noooo... - Yes! I always liked swords I don't know why Maybe, because of their shape? - Because of strength? Or because of their place... Sword is along the leg when it's not used, and it is directed up and forward in attack I don't know... Do you really want to see our swords? And to touch them? I'm burning with the desire Then let's go to our cosy nook - Pardon? There is a place in the park for our swords Here is our collection The key Open the door, my friend But I don't see any swords Where are the swords? What is going on? Father, all these women want to confess My cousin is the first Father, everyone wants to confess only to you Why? Do you have something special? Probably. Come in my daughter My cousin alone will take the whole hour Ladies, let's go to bath-house Nobody can resist nice light steam I was afraid to forget something, so I brought my notebook There is a list of my sins All classified: deadly sins minor sins To not forget anything My mother always told me: a good Christian keeps everything in order Very good My cousin played a joke on me, and I did the same for her But it is nice, jokes are not a sin I started to pet myself and then... It's impossible! I was lying with baronne... My child, do you believe in God? I love God, I adore God! Do you do your religious duty? I'm... I'm very religious Then I don't understand anything You believe in God - Yes But you behave like a lascivious cat in spring Oh, no-no It is not like that My head thinks one thing, but my body acts completely different But, but... Poor you, you don't understand what the sin is The word "sin"! Sin! Your body conflicts with your soul Sin is when your soul can't resist desires of the body, sin is when your body is against your mind And... Please, don't repeat the word "sin" all the time It excites me! The next one! The next! - Already? No! I beg you! Only you can save me Go - Monsieur! Calm down, beauty - Please, please listen to me! The next! I want to go to the Heaven Don't worry about it My bed for massage Luison and Josefine Both were baptized by Cardinal And my little hot room It's horrible! - Not at all, it helps to lose weight This is Mohamed Baronne bought slaves in Istanbul to give them freedom After that Mohamed wanted to stay with us He massages me every day His skin is very soft. He is castrated He is also mute. His tongue was cut off when he was a slave And tongue too?! Poor boy, he must be very sad He can't have sex - Quite the contrary! Castrates are the best lovers in the East They have no testicles, but their penis is fine They can have sex for hours, they just don't have any orgasms and don't cause any side effects Mohamed, do you still have F-sharp oil for Madame Diderot? Long, tender, sterile... Not like our men Probably, castration was invented for our pleasure. Come in Mohamed, massage Madame Diderot And his hands...Hands... Wonderful hands! You both are virgins How did you know? When you went into the water, there were no air bubbles between your legs - And? A woman who lost virginity always lets a few bubbles out Madame Therbouche, if only you knew how I'm tired of being a virgin And me! I can foretell your future through lines on your hands How strange. I've never seen anything like this before What do you see? You both will lose your virginity with Whom? - Chevalier? with a circumcised man Circumcised? - Circumcised? My milk bath Why are you laughing like hyenas? The hands... Oh, these hands... Swine! Swine! Darling, this is just massage No, I wouldn't name it massage. That was something different Mo-mo, what did I tell you? Not with guests! With me - yes, and whenewer you want But not with guests! You are mine - I have a rendezvous Who with? - With you, of course You promised me Three days ago I got rid of a child that I carried inside Leave me alone I hate compassion even more than lust Man's care is worth no more than his caress It's just another way of trying to have me. Nothing else "Our Father" three times, "Hail Mary" two times, and God will forgive you Next! Three "Our Father", two "Hail Mary", and God will forgive you Next! Kneel, my daughter! Three "Our Father", two "Hail Mary", and God will forgive you Next! Next! Hurry up Three "Our Father", two "Hail Mary"... Nobody? Anybody else? Next! Kneel, my daughter Three "Our Father", two "Hail Mary", and God will forgive you Get out of there! Get out, miserable... Go and confess, immediately! But I dont want Don't worry. Everything will be fine It is like vomit after bad food And then you can eat anything you want again - It's disgusting! I'm going to pray - It's impossible, Father There is a poor girl that wants to save her soul She can't wait Do you want my cousin to die from the burden of sin? Of course not Priest! I need a priest! We have everything that you need Go away, go away! Monsieur, I need to confess I'm dying, my sin strangles me Don't worry my child, I'm here to help you Let us in! It's urgent! What "three"?! Three, three, three men! Three men together! And I shared bread with them! Yes, but it was so nice, Father. Very nice Shut up! You and your wife... You are beasts! My wife? Yes, your wife! A bitch that wants everyone whom she sees! We both are bogged down in sin! What a couple! My wife? - Go away! I don't confess you! You will all burn in hell! You, your wife and your abominable cousin! My cousin? - My friend! What I have just learned! Wait! Our child... He has a fever! He is all shivering! He is dying! Monsieur... This is the beginning of punishment! Visitation of God! He is paying for your sins! He will die Kneel! Everybody Open your mouth, show your tongue What a scoundrel, he's eaten all my chocolate Then it's easy, he has liver pain It's impossible to have liver pain after only 4 kilos of chocolate It is high quality food Baronne, bring volume VII of the Encyclopedia, there is an article about liver Open your mouth Resign yourself, Monsieur Diderot If there is God's will, he will recover If not, then he will die Your religion made you lazy, Cardinal You can take care of his soul, and I'll concern about his body Liver is an internal organ of the human body, joined with four other organs... People treat you like a market-woman, but for me you're the only noble woman here Last night I read your thesises about gravitation You surpassed Newton You are the only woman who is master in Greek, Latin, Hebrew and ancient Chinese I adore you... - Oh, thank you... Thank you Toinette, what is the matter? You are an idiot! You still haven't found the printery! Don't you have any ideas, suspicions? No - I'll fire you out Then pay me. You already owe my a lot No! You have a mission. I pay for espionage, not for games I spent a lot. Pay half at least No. Let me through I'll force you to speak and find the truth My God, this world is so horrible God, why are you doing it to me? I'm just a common man God, please, give me a sign Break is ower. Go back to work Thank you, God! Thank you!! My friend, my friend... Don't do it here! Hurry up... Abbot, my chest, my chest Hurry, quicker! Abbot, didn't you forget my umbrella? Are you leaving us already? Enough is as good as a feast You can't just leave our souls in sin A long time ago, when I just became a priest, I confessed a whole brothel Young whores and old whores I have more respect for them than for you! They worked a lot. Their behavour was sinful, but their souls were fair Those respected whores had fear of God And you don't give a damn about anything, you only want to enjoy yourself and have fun You pervert even the Sin! Even the devil would despair if he met you I don't want to waste my time with you But Father, we're having African dinner today Why has he left so suddenly? We got rid of him and it is wonderful! F-sharp... So, you are a spy By the way, can you paint? Only sketches Portraits help me to get in everywhere I finish my pictures very seldom People are so self-complacent, and possibility to pose for history takes their caution away I steal their secrets and leave a sketch of the picture Why are you still not exposed? Nobody wants to tell that he was a fool Why do you work for those people? - They pay me Paid, at least I don't understand. You are so beautiful and smart... This world is horrible I learnt how to survive Do you think there is big difference between you and Cardinal? You are the same! You want power! You want your ideas to be the best I just want to convince Without force or persecution Why are you smiling? You are an actress! Me? Nero was an actor too in Rome in fire I always wanted to spend one night with Nero Hush up I got used to much simpler compliments Thank you for not telling anything to Cardinal. But... Why did you keep silence? After I talked to you, I've got a new, exotic, strange feeling What is it? Sympathy I'm going away. I'm leaving France You are not going, you are running away Please, stay... I have completely... lost my mind Put it back Stay... The ship to Amsterdam won't wait for us Tell me what we wrote in "Ethics" in a previous volume Ethics, Ethics... Ethics: see "Morals" Good. You will write in the "Morales" article the following: Morals: see "Ethics" But... - Don't argue But this is cheating Morals - Yes And absence of morals But our readers will be torn between volumes VI and X and won't find anything So much the better. They will start to think I'm disappointed, monsieur Me too, Abraham Is life like this? No, not life This is philosophy You want simple philosophy But life is complex Desire for simple ideas leads only to fantasies Let your mind to be free Go to sleep with one, wake up with another I'm talking about ideas Be engaged with one, attack another. And don't get attached to anyone Thoughts are like women You reject them, follow them, get tired of them, and suddenly forsake everything and disappear Philosophy is an accidental girl Don't take it as true love And don't trust anyone, Abraham Even yourself Excuse me monsieur, I'll be right back Are these you in Madame Therbouche's painting? Don't you see? I'm not sure. Here is everything except the head Abraham, please help us. Only you can help us I can't right now It is a question of life or death Are you sure that Abraham is circumcised? It is very likely with such name Abraham, come in... What is it? Police, madame Go back, quickly! Come now, have some food I can't see my friends skinnier than me What is this? Popcorn - No, thank you It is not for you. Don't look Police! They are coming here with the Cardinal! You are surrounded! Surrender! Surrender, Diderot! Shoot! We can't shoot at a church Shoot in the air! Break the door! The church is a holy place This is not a church, there is the clandestine printery! Break the door! Happy birthday, Father! Happy birthday! What? What's going on? Look at this ungrateful man!
