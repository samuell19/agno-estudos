When I was a kid, the world was as big as my imagination, which is pretty big. Only it was imaginary. We send our love from Earth. We're gonna transmit to these two astronauts who are up about 220 miles up there somewhere. I'd have said, "You know, one day there's gonna be spaceships up there orbiting the Earth." And then if I said, "I'm gonna sing for the people up there, I'm gonna meet the crews," they would have locked me up right there. We consider you an explorer just as we are and we're all targeted toward the same thing and that's ensuring a bright future for the young people in our planet. No one's ever had a wake-up call like the two astronauts on the International Space Station got this morning. We read you loud and clear on Space Ground 2. We would like to say good evening to you all in Anaheim, California. Good morning. It was this world of ambition and imagination. You can't imagine, you know, what's gonna happen in your future. So much has happened since those days. Paul seems so aware of the journey he's taking you on. It transcends age and it transcends boundaries. He does tap into your heart. He does grab something in everybody. I looked at his face and it really tells a story. Everything about his life is on his face. When you watch him, it is your life. You know, it is your life. It's your whole life. We're all in this together. It's not an us and them situation, it's all of us. And that's why we called the tour the US tour. It's like if you're a family and you're giving a party then these are all your guests. Three, two, one. Nice to meet you. How are you? - Swift by nature. - Yes. And this is the US tour because it's about us. It's about us, it's about us all together. We're all in this together. Hey, good morning, everybody. It's a beautiful fall day. Sunday morning, Q 1043. Good morning, Paul McCartney. - Hi, how are you? - How are you? - I'm all right, thanks. Yeah. - Paul McCartney, - this is the biggest thrill of my life. - Yeah, I'm just driving in to the gig. - How are you doing? - We're not worthy! We're not worthy! This is a man so excited to see you in concert tonight, Paul. We can't wait. I'm just on the radio. Don't stop now! Yeah. All right! Okay, man. Can you tell we're excited to see you, Paul? You know what? I'm getting the feeling. One of the greatest shows I've ever seen, last night at the Garden, Paul McCartney and the band who is just at the top of his game. Songs take on a new thing when you play them live to an audience. As good as it gets, and wow. So we had a lot of fun, actually. The crowd was sensational. 20 Forthlin Road, many of my formative years were spent at the house. I think Paul was completely modeled by his mother and father. They gave me great support growing up. He had a sense of the straight and narrow and never left him. My dad was a cotton salesman and my mom was a nurse. Their values were very strong. They gave me a good set of rules. I didn't listen to all of them because you don't, you know, you're teenaged. But eventually, they've been the rules that I've lived by. I don't really think that I showed any sort of startling promise. I can't remember anyone sort of saying, "Hey, this guy is a bit of a prodigy." I think I started to imagine there was more out there than my narrow little sphere of reference. We thought we were just getting into it to earn a few bob, to, you know, be famous. In actual fact, something much more important has happened. They changed popular music forever. They gave everybody the license to go some place else. That was a particularly big world of energy that I wanted to plug into. All these years he's been out on his own, always growing. There's something about him that's changeless and it's profoundly appealing to people. He's an American icon. He means something to us and we feel like that we have at least a small claim on him. I was in the Staples Center in Los Angeles when he sang, and it was amazing. The whole generation of young people, virtually everybody in the audience was much younger than me. And they were just as into it as I was. This is for you. This is the only tour. Yeah, there's touring and touring, you know. McCartney is very special. Oh, it's the tour! We call it the US. Tour "US" tour, not US. tour This is probably the best crew I've ever worked with. And it's always fun being around people that you can laugh and joke and, you know, let your hair down so to speak. It all comes from the top with Paul. He's very much hands-on with everybody. He makes everybody feel involved in the team. - It just radiates from there, really. - It is us. Out stories are very much fitting for this one. For secret reasons too. I mean, there are a lot of secret relationships. Two guys just got married last night on the crew. I think four caterers fell in love out here. It's a very US tour. For me, it's a fantastic thing because really I just started off wanting to do my job, and I love music, so I was in a band and that became the Beatles. And because it was such a phenomenon, it rose us to levels of great fame, which were kind of difficult to deal with in a way because it's a bit embarrassing. Suddenly, you're not just the guy you think you are, you're the person they think you are as well. And sometimes, you know, "Look, guys, I'm just ordinary. I'm just lucky I write some songs you like." "No, you're not." Through good times and through bad, this man's music has been there. He's given spirit and life to so many people through his music. It's an extraordinary accomplishment to come from just one person. His music is a unifying force because he is. Music is a very powerful healing device because it's part of who we are as humans. Music is the universal language. You can't define that. You can't define where it comes from. Why do these combinations of vibrations, why do they affect us so much? How come they really affect our emotions? It's just so special, you know. And it's something to do with the words, or something to do with the chord changes. I love that. I really love that about what I do. When I write a song, I try and reach something in somebody. There's families that come to the show. I can relate to them. It's quite emotional for me. The idea that they're all pulling together, all these generations. Kind of the sweetest thing once a student said to me, his name was John Paul, and he said, "My father named me after the Beatles, and right now we're going through a very difficult time." And he said, "I thought if I took this class, I would be able to maybe have something to talk and have in common with my father, and be able to get on slightly better terms with him." For families who have felt fracture, who have felt divisiveness, this is an opportunity to come together under the banner of, not only great music, but of music that makes us, when we leave, feel like the world can be the place we want it to be. All right, guys, let's go and do our bits and pieces right that way. A Beatle, a Wing, a poet, an artist, a humanitarian, a living legend. Ladies and gentleman, Sir Paul McCartney! I actually cupped his buttocks. - Beyonc√©. - Nice to meet you. Pleased to meet you. It was genius writing, genius writing, genius recordings. He's ahead of his time. - You're doing it again. - Yeah, we're doing it again. - I'm checking it, man. I'm checking it. - All right. Paul, put your ass lower than that. That's the most fun I had in a couple of months. If you were to do a toast too, it'd be really good. If you stood up and said, "That was good. I'm really proud I did that." - Yes. - Yes. Showtime! Apparently, in the old Shakespeare days, the guys used to go on stage and there would be royalty, like on stage, and they said to each other, "Break a leg." - I like that. Break a leg. - Break a leg. I don't sing that well. I had this overwhelming sense that somehow through this incredibly easy stage manner, there is a humility that really betrays his incredible celebrity, that somewhere deep down inside him, he must know how important he is to people like me, just another guy that went and bought a ticket to see him in concert. You know, certain songs touch you and you bond with those songs and love them and then to see him that close and look him right in the eyes and he's talking to you, it's overwhelming, life-changing. Oh, yeah! Thank you! You know, I'm getting that feeling again like we're gonna have a little bit of fun here tonight. Okay, you will see mysteriously arriving behind me a piano. And before this piano arrives, there is a big hole. And on the second night of this tour, I forgot there was a big hole. And I was chatting away to the audience, I was holding my bass and I fell backwards into the big hole. Yeah. And, you know, everything goes into slow motion when that happens. And I'm just, I know I'm going. I know I've lost it. So I'm going like this and I can just remember thinking, "How deep is this hole?" Okay, there's a big hole in the stage and I just fell into it. Rock and roll! - We've been expecting this to happen. - Yeah. - And it happened in Tampa! - You saw it first! Yeah. It's okay! It's filled now! - Good times! - One, two, three, four. Yeah. Thank you! Wixy, darling! When you come to work, if you've got a good team that you can relate to and you can enjoy it, then it's us. Well, we have really got the best team, yeah. And the thing is it's grown up through the years. Well done. They keep coming back. Fools. I warned them. When I do my show, I get this beautiful feedback, like a great feeling. I feel that all my people feel great. - Speech! Speech! - I couldn't think of a better place to be. This playing, you guys, you keep me young. They know what the vibe is. We're all trying to just give that audience something to remember. This guy looked at me. Sorry, I got someone do eye contact there, that guy there. That man there. - He's been looking at me. - I have my retina burner with me. I well remember writing this next song in the front parlor of our little council house in Liverpool. Looking through the lace curtains on to the road, 20 Forthlin Road. One, two, three, four. It's such a short little song, you know, I just wanna keep going, keep going. Thank you! When the Discovery space mission went up to the International Space Station, it was a very historic mission. We're very proud to say that on the morning that NASA actually told them that they were cleared to reenter into the Earth's atmosphere and come home, they actually woke them up with one of our songs. So it sounded something like this! Good morning, Discovery. And the wake-up music this morning just about says it all. It's a nice day for sunshine and it's a day for feet on the ground. Thanks, CNN. We sure hope that we get our feet on the ground today. And we do too, Wendy. Three, two, one. Listen, we got a surprise for you tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the crew of the Discovery in person. Well, this was fantastic. They walked on as proud as punch and all looking great. But I could see by the expression on their faces, they were really buzzing as well as us. I was so excited. And I must say, as I went along the line and sort of thanked them all, I must say when I got to Wendy, she was welling up. She was pretty emotional because it was a really emotional moment. You know, suddenly there they were, not only back on Earth, but, like, wrapping up this whole story, on-stage with us. That's great. There was the Discovery crew. Yeah, man. It was fabulous. One of the interesting things that happens when you get out on the tour, people start bringing signs and, you know, when you're doing a new song like that, you're trying to concentrate on the chords and the melody and the words and putting it all together, trying to stay focused, and then a sign will appear and you're, like, drawn to it. You've got to look at it, you know. And your mind is split in two. One half of your mind is saying: "Don't look at it. Don't look at it, focus. Chords, words, keep going. Think, don't you..." But the other half of your mind is going, "Yeah, go on, look at it. Read it. What's it matter?" And so you do. So... Oh, man, I tell you, it's not easy to try to put it all together and you're looking up there saying: "My mother saw you at Candlestick Park!" No! No! - Hello! - I brought Paul. - Oh, we're a Beatle family. - Yeah. Hi, guys! - How was school? - Okay, Mom. - Jenny's here. - Hi, Jen. Rocky. Come here, Rock. Hi, Lucy, come on out. Lucy. We're in here talking about Paul McCartney and the Beatles. He's the man. That's why we have him here with us today in our kitchen. Just so we can touch him. If we met him in person we wouldn't really actually touch him that much. - We're a Beatle family. - Good taste. - Is he still singing in the same key? - Same original key. Yup. - Really? - That is nuts. I swear he sounds better with age. If there's been any influence in my life other than, you know, my family and my religion, it's been Paul McCartney. Wouldn't it just be nice to say thanks? - Yeah. - That's all. I don't wanna say, you know: "Hey, Paul, I love you and... You know, let me tell you about my life." Which I'm sure everybody feels that he's, you know, their best friend and that they know him so well. But to be able to say thank you. Those girls screaming and crying in the old Beatle video: They're just crying and screaming and it's like, I went to the concert and I was like: You know, like trying to hold back my tears but you can't help it. You just get... It's so powerful. And let's face it, he still looks good, too, doesn't he? Yeah. He's still hot. We're ready to go. Ready to see Paul. All right, let's go. You think they'll figure out where we're going with our shirts on? It's like the classical music of our time. He doesn't condescend to his audience. He really embraces them. He's happy to see grandparents in that audience. He's happy to see 6-year-olds. He doesn't deny them his music. He's not egotistical about what he's created to the point that it is supposed to be sophisticated. Paul McCartney does not laugh at you for having that nostalgia. You know, he doesn't scorn it. He endorses it, loves it and he's the greatest ringleader, you know? You see, you know, multiple generations of people crying, singing along with the entire concert, not one or two songs. The entire concert. That's a profound thing right there. Do you feel the love at all? The boys are great, the girls are great. You're all great. Oh, yeah. - We have a traveling crew of 70 guys. - Watch out, some wreckers. He's right up-front, he's a very personal guy. He's very accessible to the crew always wants to know the guys' names and the gals' and he sets the tone. We come in and mark the floors at 7 am. Then 8:00 we do a full unloading. Keep coming! Everybody has their job. Everybody comes together, gets it done. Get it down here. Straight up? And up, up and away. Technology makes things easier and harder all at the same time. Hey, Rick, no power to the bottom stick. The stage is pretty cool. A lot of engineering, and a lot of advance work goes into these shows. We're good. We're good. The stage usually rolls into place within five hours. There it goes. Straight, you guys. I get the show clock running, get everybody into their show mode and make sure everybody is in their positions. We get rolling, then I'm there. Not too far from the deck. We keep an eye on everything, make sure nothing goes wrong. Thank you. Thank you. History gives us artists only once in a while of that caliber where they can bridge generations. They can bridge continents. When I think of Paul McCartney and I think of his legacy, I think of Bach, how Bach was the culmination of the Baroque period. How Beethoven single-handedly changed us from classical to romantic. And then you have the whole concept of Paul McCartney and his legacy where he took us to the ultimate of pop music in the '60s and '70s and then he changed it. And what's amazing is that he changes it in such a way that it's reflective of the society that we all live in. And as we grow and we all relate to that society and you get us into this concert venue, he touches upon different parts of that society. The society of when we were young, when we're middle-aged and we're older. And it's cross-cultural, it's cross-generational, it's an amazing event. This is the kind of way I wanna travel at home. I just don't like rush hour and I like these guys. I want, you know, I want six motorcycle cops with me at all times. Greetings, Saint Paul. Greetings, New York City. D.C. Detroit city. Denver, Colorado. Philadelphia. Good life in Chicago, that's for sure. Los Angeles. Oh, it's great to be back here. It's commuting, it's the same as what everyone does. Only we commute by plane. What's the...? Hey. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, how are you doing? - How are you? - Went right back to sleep. There are seven levels. Seven levels to this tour. Ian, you've been tooling around in that thing today? I smell very hot bread. You got a valet parking job now? Bit of extra. It's a bit of an indoors existence since you're inside a car, inside the hall, inside a hotel. I keep sort of thinking, logically looking at it, I should be sort of fed up with it. And it should be getting harder but it isn't. I suppose some of the reasons are, like you say, the transport and hotels are better. Dressing room's much cozier than it ever was. But I don't think it is that. I think it just is that I still have a passion for what I do. And when you get it right with this band, it sounds really good. This is for the Wings fans. Paul has this special, unique gift that he captures somehow the essence of what human beings have to go through because he himself is a great human being, you know? It has to come from a person who has that kind of caring about humanity in his heart. I do believe, truthfully, that music does heal. It actually acts upon the biological processes of the person. Certain notes make you feel better. Certain combinations of tones make you feel better. Heart rate will change, brainwaves change. There's McCartney's calling card. That's his trademark. It's all of these pitches that just keep swirling out and they make us feel good. It's part of who we are as humans. When you think of the human body first of all, everything about us is musical. Our heart rate is rhythm, our brains are rhythm. Our breath is rhythm. - Music is a very powerful healing device. - Music is an amazing thing. How it can be uplifting, how it can be soothing, how it can just totally change your energy. How it can make you feel better when you feel bad. The mind is the most powerful thing that we have. When the mind shifts with the music, the possibilities with the music are endless. - You have any 546? - Okay, go ahead and you guys wanna...? Yeah, 13 minutes to LLS. The space program, we have what we call "wake-up music." Today's gonna be the first time that we've ever done that live from a concert to space. Talk about bringing people together, I mean, this was actually talking to two guys who are orbiting the Earth over 200 miles above us. And we were actually just gonna talk to them as if they're on the end of a telephone line. They should be waking up right about now. As you probably know, we're gonna do something really special tonight. We're gonna transmit to these two astronauts who are up in the International Space Station right now. About 220 miles up there somewhere. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Looks like ISS will be just off the coast west of California, Anaheim. Couple of clocks with the timeline for the crew. PAO event is actually the countdown clock to this McCartney event. The addition antennas slews, it follows the satellite so as we orbit the Earth at 5 miles per second, tracks to a series of communication satellites that NASA runs. So we blend it all together and get it patched up to the particular client, in this case, Paul McCartney and the audience in Anaheim. It was so cool, you know, for me to be able to just... We were all excited. My whole crew, we got about 140 guys working... And girls. And everyone was really, really excited about this. - It's a big thing for us. - This is very cool. They're actually pumping the video into McCartney's teleprompter on the stage. It's their producers who will pump it out to the big screens at the venue. - Two minutes, that's two minutes. - Let me know when he can take it. I'll give you all systems go. And station, this is Houston on 1. Video looks good. - Standby for a call on 2. - Houston, we're ready. And, Bill, we read you loud and clear on Space Ground 2. - How us? - Loud and clear. They can look out the window and see the concert. Good view. - Fantastic. - We'll be live to 22,000 people. Just 22,000 screaming fans. I was very excited because people at NASA, you know, were split-second timing and talking to the space station and they're talking to us. And really, all I had was a guy in the pit. He's got a card. So he says, "Six minutes left." I'm going, "We are so high-tech. I love us." We have your pictures. We can go ahead and tell them all systems go. Standby. - We're good to go. - We're gonna go now to the International Space Station. Check it out, here we go. There they are. Yeah. Bill and Valery, we have a greeting for you from all the audience here. Good morning! We'd like to wake you up with a little bit of "English Tea." Here we go. Would you care to sit with me? For a cup of English tea? Thank you. We are honored again that you have joined us. We consider you an explorer just as we are. Your venues of exploration, of course, have ranged everywhere from music to fashion, and I guess even now you've become an author and we're all targeted towards the same thing and that's ensuring a bright future for the young people in our planet. Okay, well, I think we all go along with that, Bill. We wish you all the very best for the rest of your mission. I tell you what, before we go, can we see another one of those somersaults? Paul McCartney concert ticket, $ 100. ISS, $40 billion. Live concert, Paul McCartney on the space station, priceless. I got a number of different things which I'm extremely proud of. I got tons and tons of McCartney here. Nothing in that room. I'm prohibited from having Beatles in every room. I got a concert in Detroit on the 14th, in Columbus on the 22nd. I'm going to Las Vegas November 26. We're getting into McCartney mode. We'll worry about retirement a little bit later. It's not like it's just adult's music or just kid's music. - It's for everybody. - It's for everyone. Okay, so here's your new "Chaos in Columbus" T-shirts. And, Ashley, this one is yours. Now, you'll see. - Line up. - Line up. - Line up. - Line up. Isn't it nice? It's six grand kids work out to six letters. We're going to Paul McCartney. Okay. - We're here for the McCartney concert. - I'm locked out of my car. - Oh, for real? - Yeah. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Here's the work station right here, guys. I put it together, you glue it, okay? Get that a little wet. It'll come off. Make sure ME is in the middle. I'm on my second. - You're on your second already? - Yup. I've got two of them ready to go right here. - Help. - Hey, we gotta make sure that you can just flip it. - Practice. - If you practice. - All right, we're done. - I know we're going there. Aren't we gonna eat supper? Which one is it? There's a few things we're gonna skip and supper's one of them. Grandma and I will be on either end of you guys. Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos. We love you. We have... One, two, three. Three generations. Three generations. - Three generations. - Our children and our grandchildren. Who's going to introduce you? - Nobody. I am. - Paul is. - How are you? - Stan family. How are you doing? - Oh, my God. - Hello. Oh, my God. I just came in to say hi. How are you doing? You just don't know what this means to my husband. - You just don't know. - Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do. - Is this your husband? - Yes. Oh, my. How did I guess? Thought we'd come in and just surprise you. - Yeah, you definitely did. - We're surprised. - Is that all yet? - Yeah. Both of you? I think that's it. Good to see you tonight. Yeah, I hope you enjoy yourselves tonight, okay? - We saw you in Detroit. - Look after her. Oh, you did? - Janet and I went to Detroit. - We were in Detroit last week. - And we're gonna see you in Vegas. - Are you? - We'll be in Vegas. - Let's party. Okay. Paul. - Hi, kids. - Hi, Paul. - Thank you. - Bye. See you. - Thank you. - All right, see you. Bye-bye. - Oh, my God. - Hurry up, I'm gonna cry. She's crying. Lord, I am now ready to die. Thank you. I was in the audience watching the show. It was fantastic. And I was thinking to myself, "Why is he doing this?" It occurred to me that he probably wanted to give some of us older people a chance to experience the performance of these songs by the guy that wrote them. Maybe for the last time in our lives. And to give young people a chance for the first time in their lives maybe the only time in their lives to actually hear these songs by the person that wrote them. That really made me think of what it must have been like at a performance in a park on a Sunday to hear Bach playing his work on a harpsichord, you know. It was pretty great. Thank you. I like him. He's a nice fellow. Can you imagine if he wasn't? Bummer, then I'd have to pretend like he's nice. Maybe it's an act. Maybe he's not that nice. We did have trouble, however, with the report of a girl in one of their rooms. That of Paul McCartney. They told us that Minneapolis is a very narrow-minded town as were its police officials and that other cities had been very tolerant to the parties that they'd held in their rooms. One of their group with a British accent told me that they would never come back to Minneapolis and I remarked to him that if they did not come, it would be too soon for me. This is a typical traveling troupe, much like you have with a circus. In that they are here today and they are gone tomorrow. Paul has written songs that went through some instruments that were documented, recorded and then sold and marketed on tangible, you know, objects. But this music, his ideas have transcended that and gone and now they live inside of people's minds and their souls so that... Now it can't die. It's immortal. It's going to keep moving forward. When you can do that, if a songwriter can do that, yes, that's a divine intervention. That's spirituality right there. I love you, Paul! People have... Some can talk about love, about peace. Understanding. And people have talked about that for thousands of years. And I think whenever you get it, I think it works. We're at the moment, I think, you know, in particularly hard times. But I sort of think that that's part of the story and that people's strength and people's humanity and people's common sense is gonna prevail. You wanna get back? I wanna get back. Let's get back. For a person like Paul McCartney, who's been an icon now for more than 40 years, he's been able to reach an enormous percentage of the world's people with a message that is universal. That so many of his greatest songs are about personal experiences people can identify with or emotions that are positive and good that we all ought to share. How could anybody be angry at someone after that show? It just was such a powerful vibe. I felt spiritually uplifted as I hadn't maybe ever been in a concert. Just opening the floodgates emotionally and creatively and artistically and saying: "Let's all celebrate this together, and I mean it. I mean these songs." That's what I get seeing McCartney. It's a visceral connection that can bring tears to your eyes and you don't know why. Inside emotionally, there's no doubt what it means. I think what makes Paul McCartney happier than anything is to see someone similar tapping their toes to something that he's written. And people like that bring joy to the world. I would assume that he's a man whose heart is filled with joy as well because of that. He's given us a great gift. His lifetime of music and his generosity of spirit are a perfect blend, I think, for what the world needs today. I think it's basically the same thing. That there's more than just this to our existence. Couldn't put a finger on it. I don't think I really would want to. It gives me faith that we're not just a bunch of mindless creatures stuck in this machine, march through the world. That we've got a great humanity and that a lot of us think alike. We have a lot in common with each other.
