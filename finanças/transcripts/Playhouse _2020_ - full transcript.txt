Shh. Shh, hey, it's okay. Shh. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, shh, shh, shh. It's just a nightmare. Hey, hey. Wanna tell me about it? Oh, I knew you'd ask me that. Oh, just go, you stink of cigars. Sometimes it's best to talk about it. You're weird. Am I? You sleep okay? Sleepover. Or is it tomorrow? It's too thick, isn't it? They don't even like me. You mean you don't even like them? What's not to like? They've only known you two months. You're the new girl on the block. On the block? Queen of the Scottish castle. Oh, don't say that, I hate it when people say that. Where are all your friends, anyway? Why is it just me who has to make an effort? One, I do make an effort. And two, you're the one finishing school today. I don't want you moping about in your room all day not seeing anyone. You seem to have made a pretty good career out of that. Yes, but I get paid for it. You could pay me. Ha, ha, ha, ha. It was the perfect blend! Bee, wait. - I'm late, Dad. - Wait, I wanna show you something. Close your eyes. - What? - Please. No tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, behind these boards is the seed of what lies ahead, a vision of what is yet to be. Do not be afraid. It may appear as magic, but I can assure you, it's only theatre. The makeover. Which is your favourite, two or six? Oh, I shouldn't have said that. I prefer it as it is. You're absolutely right, - it's more... - Ugly. Yes. Bee, can you at least show some excitement about all this? Forget the paint, I mean the whole thing. This place, our new life. I didn't want a new life. I'm trying to make things better for us. There's something here, I can feel it. I'm alive, I'm alive! - The "Living Play." - The "Living Play," Bee. - A play that has to be... - Has to be experienced, not merely seen. Hundreds of people exploring multiple rooms all at once. Yes. Props, costumes, sound design, special effects. Yes. Actors bring history alive under one terrifying narrative. - Yeah, a living... - A living piece of shit. See you later, dad. Don't write anything I wouldn't do. My patience is thin, Mr. Bremner. What exactly are you asking? One more week, sir. One more week, sir. My boys, they'll work in the fields until I can pay. They're fit, strong... If I wanted labourers, I'd employ labourers. I have a daughter. And what area of employment would you presume upon your... And what area of employment would you presume upon this daughter? She, uh, a maidservant, or... Or? Hi, you must be our new neighbour. I'm Jenny. Bee. It's nice to finally meet you, Bee. - Is that short for... - Beleth. Beleth, oh, that's nice. Well, we've been curious to know who's moved into the castle. So, your parents with you? My dad. Is he gonna fix the place up? Guess you could say that, yeah. Gets awful lonely up here. My dad's a writer, that's kind of the point. Be good to catch him sometime. You sure about that? Jack Travis, look him up. Guessing the sheds are cleared. I see you got the TV working. It's been working for ages. Did you even hear what I said? Something about making tea or something? Where's that tea? No, no! You can get out there and take down those sheds like I've been asking for weeks. Oh, yeah, 'cause no one's gonna buy your granny's house if there's some nasty sheds in the garden. Not if they're falling apart, they won't. Your family should've sold this place ages ago, your granny's been dead for years. - Callum! - What? I'm not being funny. You've got to admit, it's pretty awful timing. Us having to come all the way up here and sort it out now. We're supposed to be taking a year out. Is it too cold and windy in the far north for poor wee Callum? More like it's too boring and shite. Yeah, well, that's life. Look, you'd only be sat on your ass watching TV somewhere else anyway. Oh, what was that? Oh, oh, and what's that, Callum? Is that the sound of a big, manly man smashing sheds to pieces? I'll smash you to pieces. Fat chance. After everything I've done for you, Jenny? Look, you'll get a tea if you do some bloody work. Oh, sorry, did I say tea? I meant coffee. Coffee helps me do manly things. Jack Travis in the castle. What was that? What? You said a name. Um, Jack Travis. The writer? Two seconds. Here he is, Jack Travis. What? Jack Travis is famous, man, has to be. Look, he's had this hit West End play that scared the shite out of everyone. Horrorpreneur, what is that? I guess it's somebody that's an expert in scaring people. That is awesome. Yeah, well, why has he moved here? Jack Travis in the frigging castle. Katie, truth or dare? Dare. Okay, I dare you to down all of that drink in one go. - I can't. - Come on. - No. - Come on. Yes. ♪ We like to dine with Katie ♪ ♪ 'Cause Katie is our mate ♪ ♪ We like ♪ Come on. - Mm-mm, mm-mm. - Yeah, come on. That burns. Okay, Alex, truth or dare? Truth. Okay. What was the name of your first ever pet? Lame. You had a pet called Lame? Ha ha, no. Bee's turn. Oh, queen of the castle, do your worst. Ticktock, ticktock. Katie, truth or dare? Um, truth. Lame. Everybody's frigging lame. Why are you really friends with Alex? What sort of a shite question is that? Why am I friends with Alex? 'Cause we're friends? I said, why are you really her friend? This is fricking stupid. Uh, 'cause I like her and she likes me. Like, honest to god. All right, Bee, truth. Why do you think Katie's friends with me, hmm? I don't know. Maybe because you make her feel better about herself, because she's secretly a good girl and you're a slag. What the fuck? What game are you playing at, woman? We had an agreement. I, I couldn't help it, Campbell. He knew already. Then a curse be on your footsteps as you bring service to this household. This comes from a girl who sits at the back of the class drawing dragons and bats all over her work. At least I can draw. Oh, who gives a shite? That's just weird. And how old is your dad, anyway? Must have been about 15 when he had you. Oh, touched a nerve. At least I know who my dad is. Uh, piss off, you arrogant cow. You think you're all so high and mighty in your frigging castle, don't you? I'd rather live here than on some shitty council estate in Wick. And I'd rather live in the back of a bin lorry than this shitehole of a haunted castle anyway. Oh my god, a bin lorry. You do know why no one else would come here for a sleepover? I don't think she knows. This should be good. It was a cold, dark - and stormy night. - Shut up. The rain lashed at the roof tiles like an old granny pissing herself on the kitchen floor. Oh, that's nasty. Okay, so there was this evil baron who used to live here called Laird Mackay or some shite who everyone hated. And the scandal was, he was shagging his housekeeping maid, Tabitha. And obviously she got up the duff, pregnant. So they had this son, Alasdair, who, when he was older one night, blurts out in front of all of the Laird's dinner guests, "My mother's not my real mother. "My mother's the frigging maid, you bunch of culls." But that's the nice part. Laird Mackay chased Alasdair all the way down to the cellar here he spent the whole night building an entire wall around him, leaving him to thirst and starve for days. And night after night, Alasdair would cry out for help, and not even his mother, his real mother, came to save him. But there was one who did come. The devil. The devil made a pact with Alasdair. "You may have your revenge in this place, Alasdair, "but you will do my work for eternity." Next thing you know, Tabitha is found dead at the bottom of the staircase, every bone broken. Laird Mackay went insane, threw himself out of the highest window in the castle. Or so they say. Some say, if you put your hands to the wall where Alasdair was buried alive, you can still hear his screams. His screams to be set free again. That's ridiculous. Then prove it. Dare. I dare you to put your hands on the wall. What's the point? It's just a wall. A pact with the devil? Then what are you worried about? The only thing I'm worried about is looking completely stupid. Well, you already kinda are, so. You two are doing it as well. Aye. You left me no choice, Tabitha. Please, Mackay, he's just a boy. And a boy he shall remain. Let him go, far from here. You're his mother, Tabitha. Would you wish him away so far from home? Oh my God, is this it? It has to be. Okay, who's first? You's can frig off. Bee? Stupid question. Hm. Okay, Bee, your turn. What about Katie? It's your castle. This is so stupid. Hey. Sorry if I acted like a bitch yesterday. I don't think that. Why do you think you were? I just hate school. So did I. So why the castle? It's kind of a big old place for just two people. My dad's kind of... He writes weird stuff. What was his last one about? Never watched it. You never watched your dad's play? What's he working on how? He has this crazy idea. What? I can't say. I won't tell anyone. It's immersive, um, like a walkaround play. In the castle? What's it about? Maybe you should come over sometime. Shit, I'm just making this worse. You're gonna have to come and do this, love. Since when did you ever iron a shirt? Exactly, that's exactly my point. Who are these people anyway, the crease police? You don't have to come. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, uh, wine and cheese in a castle? No, I think I might just stay home, maybe iron the rest of my clothes. So this girl just invited us over, then? She's just being nice. Yeah, well, let's hope they are, eh? You can always leave. What do you mean, "You can always leave"? I'm beginning to think you don't want me there. I didn't mean... Apparently her dad likes his own company. Okay, so why are you going, then? Look, Jenny, if I had something better to do, believe me, I would go and do it. Leave you with all the socialising with famous writers. I honestly don't know how your family survived growing up round here, I really don't. People are afraid of the dark, aren't they? It's as though we can just all forget our deepest troubles by sitting in a circle, and stroke some kittens, and do some mindfulness exercises. There's this idea that we're like, um, wheelie bins. Here we go. No, seriously. This idea that we're all just full of rubbish, okay, and that all we need to do is just empty it and do some breathing, stroke an iguana, listen to some whale song and bang, it's all gone. What would you do with all this rubbish instead, then? Well, uh, if we are going for the wheelie bin analogy, which is mine, thank you, what I would say is that we need to, uh, look closely at what's in the rubbish, go through it and find what's in there that might be, uh... Rubbish. No, um, no, useful. But isn't it so much easier to just pay the council tax and have someone take it all away? No self-examination needed. Well, I suppose that's the problem, isn't it? It's always about what's easiest. Take Jack, okay? Jack's got his own troubles, his own rubbish, hm? You're a writer, I imagine you use it to write. You can't write without some serious reflection, some self-examination, right? Oh, you can. Okay, okay, you can. But I mean, it wouldn't be any good, would it? All you have to do is, you have to go back to your life, examine your rubbish, and in some way turn it into fuel. I mean, for example, uh, hm, what was it that fueled you to buy this place? A witch. Sorry, did I say witch? I meant estate agent. Oh, you got me. That just sort of fitted, didn't it? See? Jack's not afraid to go to dark places. That's where people find themselves. If we don't know what we're afraid of, then how can we know anything at all? We know ourselves from the decisions we make. Yeah, okay, to a degree, but... Why don't we ask Bee? Bee, what's that short for again? I told you, Beleth. Oh, isn't Beleth a demon? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's the, one of the gods of hell, isn't he? He had like 85 legions of demons, of... Why would a Cambridge student decide to have a child before he graduated? Okay. Or maybe it was because he didn't decide to have a child. - Maybe it just happened... - That's enough. And he thought, can't change shit now. That's enough. Bee, Bee, wait. What is all that shit in your office? What, this place is haunted? Don't be ridiculous. Well, what's with the paranormal murder inquiry pinned to your fucking wall? It's nothing, it's just folklore and rumours. And you're all over it like a fly around shit. That's enough. We wouldn't even have this place if it wasn't for all that. I never even wanted this place. God, Mum was right, it's all about you. You're messed up. You listen here, Beleth. I am this close to something great. Thousands of people will come here and experience something they have never before imagined. I don't care. You need to start honouring everything I've done for you, you feckless waste of skin. Dad, let go of me. I'm not saying don't do it. Just think about it, Jack, - it's a long way away. - From where? I don't want people just nipping out from London at high tea to pop in on Jack Travis's new play thing. This is a whole new level of experience. I know what you're trying to do. I'm sorry, I don't think you do. People will come for days. Well, they'll have to. Days? Weeks, months. They'll quit the rat race and build houses on the beach. Samantha? Samantha? I love your passion, Jack, you know I do. The whole thing does add colour to your story. Who's gonna back you? I've got backing. Really? The whole thing's coming together. Well, I'm happy for you, because all I'm hearing is that none of the major players are interested. It's too off the beaten track. Aye, well, perhaps that's for the best. What? Call me when you're back in London. We'll show them, won't we, Alasdair? Father and son. Hey. Pull up a seat. How's the writing going? You know, there used to be a whole village over there. That what you're writing about? - Depends. - Depends on what? On whether I can provide disabled access. How's Bee? Bee? Bee. Let me see. You ever think maybe your interest in darkness and evil... No. She's a teenager. She seems troubled. And she'll probably be very successful like her father. How much do you want for it? Want for what? I can help you. You can move back to Glasgow, get on with your lives. I don't think my great grandmother - would approve. - Ah, so the bungalow was hers. I take it she's no longer with us? Oh, no, she is. She's buried in your back garden. Bee? Tabitha. Your great grandmother was Mackay's maid. You have no idea what you're doing. - Tell me. - Get away from me! What's the matter, Jenny? It's too late. Hey, hey, baby. What you writing? Right, do you remember that time we went to Ullapool and we kept missing everything because we couldn't get out on time? The shops, the, remember the ferry? The whisky thing, the... Well, I'm taking that idea, right, this couple who just can't seem to do - that they want to do... - You're writing a play? What if we don't sell this place? What if we move here permanently? Do it up, do the gardens, everything, right? You can keep teaching, I can start writing. Look, I know, I know it sounds crazy. But just think, if I can get Jack's help, his connections, then... What are you doing? What? I'm thinking about us, about our future. I fucking hate teaching. Callum, you can't stand it here. Yeah, but that's because I'm a nobody. I'm what, I'm a teacher on sabbatical trying to clean out his grandmother in law's shitty old bungalow. It's like Damacles' sword hanging over me. Look, I've really got a shot here with Jack. - The guy's right there. - No. No, I don't want you going over there. You still haven't taken down those sheds. What the hell is wrong with you? I thought you wanted to move back up here. You're not a writer, Callum. Get a grip. Can't just suddenly do this in the middle of us trying to... Trying to what, Jenny? At least I'm trying to make something of this awful situation. Come on. Come on, Alasdair, I know you're in there. Talk to me, talk to me! What's the matter? Is this where Mackay put you? Where he starved you? That's what you get when you disrespect me. I gave you everything and you spat it back in my face! Couldn't help yourself, could you, exposing your mother's shame! Who's that? Who's there? Who's there? Bee? Don't come in. Okay. What's the matter? Where have you been? Why don't you want me to see you? You haven't missed me. Yes I have. I came back to help, but you don't want me. Help with what? Shit. Hi, Jack. Sorry, the ole' door was open. So how's it all going? Yeah, I know how that feels. The creative process, huh? Oh, speaking of which, I was... Eh, what are we drinking to? You know why I bought this place, Callum? No. You know what happens when you tell people that you own a castle? No, what's that? Sex and drugs. Eh? - I'll drink to that. - Yeah. So, what's with the papers? Ah, it's just a play. Play? Whose play, your play? Well, I mean, it's just notes at the moment, but... Well, then perform it. Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not finished. Oh, you must. A play is not for writing, it's for performing. Well, couldn't I just tell you what it's about? I don't wanna know what it's about. I want to experience it live in the flesh, huh? I wanna feel it like a cat clawing up my clavicle, searing my sinews, feasting on my festering soul. I want you to make love to my loins with your words, Callum. Rain death down upon my dissident psyche. Forget your notes, I want your play inside me. Inside me the way that Jenny's ancestors are inside this place. What? You know, her great grandmother thrown down the stairs, used and abused. Her great uncle left to starve in the wall. Please, Callum, listen... You lied to me, Jenny. Please. This is some heavy shit. - You need counselling. - Counselling? I spent my entire childhood being counselled by everyone who had an opinion. Exactly. No wonder you can't look out the window without freaking out. He's got no idea what he's doing, digging up all this. There's supposed to be a curse on that castle, a fricking curse. Your great granny was standing in this kitchen making beef bridies while her son starved to death inside a fucking wall? You wanted to find out if it's all true, if he's bringing it all back. - Callum... - Sweetheart, you need help. Callum, please. He wants people to laugh at my great grandmother's murder. My granny, my Mum. It gets a hold of you, it won't let go. Well, then, why did we move here, then? Because I can't bring a child into this world if there's still something there. Jenny. Hello, what are you doing here? I think we should have a talk. Don't you? Uh, have a seat, make yourself at home. Shouldn't be too hard. What's on your mind, neighbour? I need to know what you're working on, who it's about, what happens. I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you. Will you excuse me? We're out of coal. Leave it. I said we're out of coal. Jenny. - Callum. - Go home. This is between me and Jack. Over my dead body it is. Oh, please, I don't want to cause any trouble. Callum, would you be a darling and go and fetch us some more coal? It's much more cheerier with a fire. We're not here for a soiree, Jack. Please! Downstairs, I insist. Might as well get cosy, yeah? Bee? So your great grandmother was Mackay's maidservant, the illicit mother of Alasdair Mackay, the devil's own tortured servant of the night. I suppose you don't want me to make anything of it, keep it in the wheelie bin. What gives you the right to come up here, dig up my past and put it on display like some gothic freak show? I wasn't aware it was buried. I'll tell you what I am very interested to dig up is why a young woman so traumatised by her dreadful, dreadful past would choose to live next door to the very place where her family were so affected? It strikes me, if anybody's digging anything up, it's you. And what about Bee? What does she make of all this? There's your coal. Let's go, Jenny. I'm not finished. Yes you are, let's go. Callum, I'm not leaving. Jenny, we're going. Like hell we are. Look, I don't know what's going on here, okay, but I don't like it, any of it. Whatever happened to your family here was awful. All I know is that we need to leave now. What is it? Oh, shit! We need to go! You wee devil. Very good, Beleth. You can come out now. Nice place. It's a little draughty. I should write a piece on this. Let me guess, feckless playwright buys Scottish castle to bolster career. I was thinking more tortured artist escapes ex-wife at castle from hell. Clearly I failed. Oh, no. You still look a little tortured to me. Are you gonna give me the grand tour? You shouldn't be here. I'm working. What are you working on? - A story. - Story. Is it about me? I haven't finished it yet. You should finish it. Get out. Where is she? You can't see her. Why? What have you done with her? - What have I done with her? - I'm Bee's mother. Her mother? Welcome home. You call this a home? Oh, no, no, no. This is more than just a home. You are full of shit, Jack Travis. Oh, Jack. Shit. You stay there, love. What do you want, Jack? She's, she's, she's dead. What? - She's dead. - Who's dead? - Who's dead? - I told you, stay in the room. It's Beleth. What, Bee's dead? No. What is it, Jack? Kathryn, Kathryn... Listen to me, Jack. What the hell is going on here? Kathryn, Kathryn. - Who, who's dead? - Kathryn! She shouldn't even be here, she should be in London. I don't... Where is she? Where is she, Jack? Jack, where is she now? The stairs, the stairs, the bottom of the stairs. - We're coming over. - I'm getting my coat. Wait. She's gone. Doesn't make any sense. Makes perfect sense. Bee, Bee. - Wait, hey... - Let go of me. Hey! Where's Bee? She's not here. What do you mean, she's not here? Something is happening. Damn right it is. Something wonderful. Where's Bee, Jack? I'll tell you exactly what's happening. Someone's losing his frigging mind. It's not like that. No? Well, then where's your ex wife's dead body? Jack, where's Bee? I don't know. How long has she been missing? Goodness sake, Jack, open your eyes. Look at what's happening to you. You have to stop this. I helped you finish your play. Everyone was scared. Yes, they were. How are you doing all of this? Beleth? No one will come, you know. Come where? To the living play. Why do you say that? We need to start again so people will be scared for real. Why can't you come back, huh, as you were? We'll do it together. We are doing this together. Hi, girls. Hi. Where are you off to? Seeing a friend. - Sorry, who are you? - Are you friends with Bee? Um, depends what you mean by friends. She's in our class. Have you heard from her? We're not her frigging secretary. Bee's weird like that, she'll just drop off the radar for days and then show up when she wants. When did you last see her? When we had a sleepover. Did something happen? No. Come on. Is Bee missing? Just tell me what happened. Come on, Katie. Nice to meet you. No, please. Did something bad happen? Something at the wall? She screamed. When she touched the wall, she screamed. You need to go home. - What? - Now. You need to leave, go on! - What the fuck? - Let's just go. Callum! Callum! What do you want, Jack? What do I want? I want to be left alone to do whatever the fuck I want. You peasants coming in here like you've something important to say. What do you want? I want you to calm down and listen to what I'm saying. You being here is a problem for me. Callum, I thought we were gonna work together. You and me? Look, we can't have all this heavy shit being paraded on our doorstep. Jenny's fragile. She needs to let go of all this. It's not right for her to carry that sort of pain. Jack, there's no shame in it. You can work on something else, something people will actually want to remember. Jack, are you hearing what I'm saying? This has to end. Jenny. Jack! Jack let me out of here now! Get out of here. You let me out of here now! Ah! Everything we've worked for. I never wanted this. You never wanted me. What are you? Tell me what you are! You created me. You are not my daughter! Bee. Jenny. Oh. Bee, wake up. Bee, can you hear me? Bee, Bee, oh, Bee! Shh, you're okay.
