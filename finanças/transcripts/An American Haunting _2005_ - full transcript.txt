[whispers] [panting] [slamming] Aah! Jane, it's Mommy. Look at me! Jane? Jane. No! Oh, thank God! Did you have another nightmare, honey? Let's get you into a nice, hot bath, huh? Can I do it later? Please. All right. But you have to get ready for your father. It's his weekend with you. I know. What's this? I found it in the attic. Honey, you know the attic's off-limits. I'm sorry. Just don't do it again, okay? I know how you feel. [Man reading] "November 1848. "I hoped that no one would ever find cause "to open this letter. "If you have, I must assume that unexplainable-- "or even supernatural events have begun to occur. "The story of the Bell Witch has always been considered to be a tall tale." Come on, slow down! [Man reading] "This is not so! Please, read this journal with great care, for its contents may save your life." Now where are you gonna go? Just one kiss. No, Joshua. Leave that young lady alone! [giggling] [whispering] Did he try to kiss you again? Isn't there something you should be doing, Miss Bell? I'm sorry, Mother. I was thinking about something else. Probably about torturing poor Joshua. You really should be nicer to him, Betsy. A woman must keep a man on his toes at all times. Isn't that what you taught me? I taught you no such thing, Betsy Bell. I'm gonna make Joshua love me forever. Well then, you better stop mistreating him. You think I was too hard on him? Just a little bit. What would I do without you? Oh, you'd just shrivel up and blow away. Now, don't forget your school work. I won't. Good evening, Mr. Johnston. Hi, thank you. Ah. ...wiped his mouth, and then he took hold of the wheel at the axle, and in an instant, that carriage was up and out of that snowbank as if 10 men had had a hold of it. 10! 10. Speak of the devil! I thought you'd gotten lost. I am not so stewed that I can't find the farm next door. I was telling them about you and that carriage last winter. Not yet. Who has the drink? You're three sheets to the wind already. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's all right, they were just having fun. Oh! Theny! Is there not a tradition connected to mistletoe, Professor Powell? Well... [laughing] Yes. Elizabeth Bell, it is not appropriate for a student to place a teacher in such a compromising situation. You know better than that, precious. Well, it is Christmas, Father. And I'm simply attempting to learn the traditions. Who better to learn from than one's teacher? My prize pupil always seems to have a ready answer for everything, John. Would you settle for a dance, Betsy? Oh, John, let them have their dance. May I steal Ms. Bell for a dance? I promise not to step on your toes. [laughs] [wind blowing] [distant crying] John? [footsteps from above] [crying] [clock ticking] [crying] [footsteps] [gasps] Oh, John. I heard noises on the roof. It's coming from the attic. Squirrels? No, it's too loud for squirrels. It's the third time I've heard it in as many nights. I hadn't heard it at all. You sleep so sound, you don't even feel me get out of bed. Yes, I do. Listen. It stopped. Stopped. What was it? Probably that witch trying to wear me out before tomorrow's trial. Oh, bite your tongue, John Bell. [creaking] [heavy breathing] [Woman] The man's a lying pig! [Man] Miss Batts! [Batts] He stole my land! Miss Batts. We have heard your side of the story. Please allow John Bell to finish his. So we offered her the use of our slave, Samuel, and the loan of $100 in exchange for our use of that small piece of her land that abuts our own. At 20% interest. We shook on it. Spit and shook. I gave you two harvests to pay and you didn't pay for it, so you forfeited the land. [gavel] It was a fair price for it. 20% interest? Well, seemed like a reasonable charge under the circumstances given her reputation. John Bell, you broke Church law. 20% interest under Church canon is usury. Miss Batts' land will be returned to her. What about my timber? He took it off my land and sold it. You would not have allowed the cutting of the wood had you not received that money and the use of the slave. But he broke Church law. You have the $100 and Samuel's work. The profit on the land is John Bell's. His loss, the loss of his good name, is punishment enough. [Crowd muttering] That's their punishment for you, John Bell. Just wait until you see mine. Your witchery can't touch me, woman. Treasure your land, health, and happy family while you can. For I swear a dreadful darkness will fall upon you. You, and your precious daughter, too. [Man reading] "Kate Batts. "Well, she was feared by everyone in the village. "They were all convinced she was a witch. "So the Bells took her cursing them very seriously. "At the time, I didn't believe in curses, "ghosts or spirits. I do now." [bird call] [wind howling] [snarling] [gunshot] [snarling] John. Father, you all right? Yeah, uh-- We got it, Father. The wolf? Wolf? We shot a deer. Come see it, Father. [growling] Father? I heard it. Back there. [growling] [growling] Keep your eyes peeled. He's black as pitch. [growling] [snarling] [footsteps] [growling] [scratching at window] Mama, Mama, Mama! Oh, what are we going through? [panting] [footsteps] [growling, panting] [Disembodied voice] Shh! [crash] [wind howling] [snarling] Betsy, what was that cry? Mother, there's something in my room! There's something in my room! Oh, the wind blew the window open. I'll close it. No! There's something in here. It got inside. Well, there doesn't seem to be anything here now, Betsy. It was probably just mice, darling. I don't think so, Mother. Let's go find your brothers. Come along. [eerie whispering] [growling] Let's go find that big, scary mouse. Yay! [gunshot] [footsteps] [latch opening] Everyone all right? We're fine. Let's get back to bed. You could've killed us. It was young John. He shot a musket into the house. It discharged accidental. He shot a musket into the house, John. [John] We were taken aback. I can't get Kate Batts out of my head. John, what's done is done. The Church has had its say, and that's that. So just put it out of your mind. [heavy breathing] Now, class, who were the couriers ordered to ride to Concord to warn that the British were coming? Yes, Theny Thorne? Paul Revere, Samuel Prescott, and William Dawes. Right, Fanny. And did they succeed, Betsy? Betsy? All right, class, let's leave this for a moment. It's time for your physical exercise, anyway. 15 minutes, now. 15 minutes only. [Children talking] Are you all right, Betsy? I'm tired. Our house makes strange noises at night. It's hard to sleep. [giggling] Now pass it to me, quick! [whispering] [Girl whimpering] Betsy! Betsy, you hurt? Where'd she go? Who? The girl who was swinging with me. You were swinging alone, Betsy. [crying] Did you see a girl? No. [footsteps] [door creaking] [door creaking] [gasps] [heavy breathing] [screaming] Betsy! Mama! I'm here, darling. Mama! Mama! Mama! It's me! Mama! Betsy, Mama's here! Betsy! Betsy! It touched me. Where? Who touched you? I don't know. I couldn't see. It was just a bad dream, darling. But it was so real. She's all right, John. She's had a bad dream. [Lucy] Let's just get you back to sleep. It was just a dream. It wasn't a dream. There was someone on the roof. What? I think maybe Kate Batts sent one of her slaves to torment us. When I find him... John. I'll whip him to within an inch of his life. My God. What? John, look at this. That son of a bitch! John! John! John, wait. John! Stop, we don't know who did this. I know who did this. You don't. Listen to me. That bitch is not gonna hurt my daughter. Go on then, be a fool! What are the two foundations of any civilized community? Church and-- Church and education. That's what, and this man pioneered them both for our community with his money and with his hands. He built the church and the Church condemns him. Usury. I broke Church law. But, Father-- Moral turpitude. Moral turpitude? Bah! He charged a rate of interest that was just a little higher than Church canon. But what the elder didn't realize was who he was dealing with. Shh, James. The boys are finally asleep. That's good. Bless them. Now, a few chapters from the Bible will take care of this house's troubles. Quietly, James. "Hannah prayed, and said, 'My heart exalts in Yahweh. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies...'" "...unclean spirit that spoke to him. "And Jesus answered, 'Be silent, "and come out of him.' "The spirit gave a loud cry, and departed." Please, all join hands. As one, we shall speak this prayer three times. Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, be silent and leave this house forever. [in unison] Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, be silent and leave this house forever. Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, be silent and leave this house forever. Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, be silent and leave this house forever. [thunder] Almost 12 and all is well. I believe your home is safe. I'm sure Kate Batts is at the root of these disturbances. Yeah. A few nights ago, I saw something. A man, I think, moving about the property. Who was he? Couldn't make out for sure. It was probably the professor. He's the only one who lives nearby. You don't think Richard has his eye on Betsy, do you? He's her teacher, for goodness sake. [clock chiming] Hallelujah, Lucy. God has answered. It's midnight and your house is quiet. Thank you, James. I beat him, Lucy. Oh, did you? [laughs] Good night, all. Good night. I wasn't looking, John, I was talking to your wife. That game don't count. Don't you blame that on me. [laughs] Set up for another one. I ain't gonna play if you're gonna cheat. I didn't cheat. My move. [gasp] [shouts] Aah! [slapping] Aah! Betsy! Aah! Open the door! [Lucy] Betsy! [John] Open the door! [slapping] Demon, release this child! Cease this at once! [John] Oh. Betsy, it's all right. [heavy breathing] [growl] [thunder] Demon, ghost, entity. Call it what you will, it is not natural. James, James, listen to yourself. You're not being realistic. Re-- There must be a rational explanation. Listen, Richard. I have documented evidence. It's the testimony of Joan Jordan at the witch trial of Olive Bartham-- Suffolk Assize of 1599. First, scraping on the walls. Then knocking. After that, shuffling. And then it clapped the maid on the cheek half-a-score times. Do you not think it is far more likely that Kate Batts, unhappy with the ruling, has sent her slaves to exact a pound of flesh from ya? Well, that's what I thought. But this was not the work of slaves. Lord, no. She was dangling there. 2 feet off the ground. All right, the incidents always happen at night and always in Betsy's room, correct? That's right, professor. So it was dark. Well, it would have been quite easy for you not to have seen someone holding her. She was suspended in mid-air by something not of this earth. John! Now, the only logical explanation is that someone was holding her. There was nobody in that room. And what about the door? The strength of three of us couldn't budge it. Well... the rain that night could have caused the door to swell. Could've. And the slaps? How did we imagine them? [laughs] Now that's a boy's trick. Dried peas blown through a hollow reed. A pea shooter? [scoffs] No pea shooter could smack her face that violently. Did you actually see someone slapping her? No, I saw her being slapped. But you did not see someone slapping her. No, that's the point. So it stands to reason you may also not have seen someone holding her. [grumbles] Now, whatever happened, it is very clear that confusion was about that room. Professor, we did not all imagine the same thing. There was something unholy in that room. John... when the school week is over, I will come and spend a night at your house and I will prove to you that this is nothing more than someone trying to frighten you. [bell ringing] All right, time's up, class. Leave your slates on my desk, please. Betsy? Hurry it up. We've gotta get to the river before it gets dark. Not today, Joshua. We've been planning this for weeks. [Richard] Run along, now. I just don't feel like it. C'mon, Betsy. I said no! Leave me alone! [Girl whispering] What did you say to her? Nothing. This will pass, Betsy. [screaming] Why? Why? [Children playing] [gasps] Remember what? [door creaking] [panting] No! No. [crying] Lucy. No, don't. [John] Lucy, what's happening? [moans] [Lucy] What is happening? It's in there with her. Richard, you should not be watching this. [slam] John! [Lucy] Open your eyes, John. He'll be all right in the head come morning, Miss Bell. And the poultice? You keep them roots on his head a while. Well, Betsy appears to suffer from violent nightmares. Did you see my sister? Of course I did. You think what my daughter just went through-- Lucy, just bear with me for a minute. Her covers were pulled off her bed. That was no nightmare. Nightmares may appear to be more than they are. People often imagine that they've seen things-- We didn't imagine any of this! You were there, you saw it! It was not natural! There's something evil here. This is blasphemy! [wind blowing] [heavy breathing] Who's there? Show yourself! Betsy? Is that you? Destroy them, oh Lord! Let them fall by their own councils! Destroy them. Destroy them! Cast them out! Do you see anyone? [breathing, voices] Repel the demons, cast them out! Stop that, James. The foolish shall not stand. They shall not stand in Thy sight. Cast them out! Cast them-- Stop it! Damn you to Hell! Are you familiar with that which Mr. Johnston reads? Of course it understands the words of the Lord. That's why it's gone. [growling] Was the reading from the Gospel according to Matthew? [rumble] Was that a yes or a no? Shh! The Gospel according to Mark? [rumble] Is it a Psalm of David? [rumble] Why are you here? Have the Bells disturbed you? Are we all having nightmares now, professor? My mess. I'll clean it. [glass being swept] [knock at door] Anky, could you answer the door, please? Yes'm. Hi, Anky. Zack... what you doin' here? Ms. Batts told me to bring this bag to the Bells. She say she find it on her land. Bye, Anky. Bye, Zack. Who was it, Anky? It was Zack, ma'am. Who works for Kate Batts? Yes'm. She give him this bag to give to you. I don't want anything of hers brought into this house. She say it belong to the Bell family. No, Mom. This is Betsy's. Yes'm, Miss Lucy, and that be Mr. Bell's shirt. They's been missin' for over a year. Why would she have their clothes? What is it, Chloe? What do you know? Tell me what you know. You heard about Ms. Kate bein' a witch and all. Well, Miss Lucy, when witches gets a critter's blood on folks' clothes... why, that mean the person goin'-- Gonna what, Chloe? Gonna what, Chloe? Gonna die, Miss Lucy. Gonna die! I'll burn it! No, Miss Lucy! That'll make it worse. That gonna let the devil in. Pass it to you! Come on! Come on! Hey, give it back! That's not fair! [shouts] Stop! Wait! Please stop. [giggling] [yelling] You're having a nightmare. [panting] It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. What happened? I don't remember. I never remember. Should I wake your parents? No. Please--please just stay here with me. Of course, Betsy. Let's get you covered up. [coughing] John! John... I'm gonna kill her! When they hang you for her murder, what happens to the rest of us? You won't be any worse off than what you already endure. John, I won't have you, John Bell. But sacrificing my life could end this torment. [wheezing, coughing] We'll find another way, John. I'll find a way. Theny? Yes, Betsy? Do you believe in the Lord? Of course I do. Don't you? I used to. Oh, Betsy. I'm so afraid. Don't be. I'm here with ya. Good night, Betsy. Good night. [Girl whispering] Betsy... Did you hear that? [Girl whispering] Betsy... [gasping] [whooshing] [panting] [voices whispering] Betsy... [Theny] Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Aah! [Girl whispering] Betsy... [sobbing softly] How long has she been this way? Uh, maybe 30 minutes, hmm? [Lucy] No more than that. Theny... can you tell us what happened? It's all right, Theny. She was having a nightmare. She was fightin' with someone. She started hittin' herself. I woke her up, and then... then this voice-- Aah! Betsy! Betsy, you're all right. Shh. Shh. [gasping] [Richard] Betsy! Betsy! Come on! Come here. Come here. Shh... [sobs] Look at me. Look at me. Shh... [Girl whispering] Betsy... Did you hear it? Shh. [creaking] [hissing] [Girl whispering] James... John, Junior... Theny... Lucy... John Bell... [Girl crying] What does it want? [James] Cease this at once! [Child crying] [giggling] [Female voices] Make him die. Make him pay. No, no, no! Who are you? [Girl whispering] She's someone who was once happy. Go to hell, Kate Batts! [strange voices] [screaming] No! Precious! Ugh! No! No! Lucy, no! Betsy, no! [screaming] Betsy! No! Stop! Don't! [Richard, reading] "It spoke. "It had a voice. "But what did it want? "Why was it makin' Betsy suffer so? "What did she do to make it so angry? "The black wolf, "the young girl visible only to Betsy, "the spirit which none of us could see, "how did they relate to each other? "Were they one and the same? "The attacks on Betsy got worse. "It spoke more and more. "I tried to get it to tell us why it had come. "My questions were answered with silence. Why wouldn't it answer?" In my life, I've done far more good than not. Even saints commit sins of some sort. How can you allow my family to be punished like this? It's the way of Satan. I've offered you my life in recompense. Why do you not take it? I beg you. I beg you, Lord. Rid us of this curse. Take my life. [coughing] [John] The Lord has forsaken me, Richard. [coughing] That which attacks Betsy attacks you as well. [coughing] "Someone who was once happy." To whom do you think that refers? Kate Batts. [sigh] Everything points to her. Well, look, if she is the cause, then why not just return the profit from the timber to her? I tried. Two months ago. I sent Chloe to see her, money in hand. She sent it back. Then she does mean to torment you-- Until I die. This...entity, do you believe it can read your mind? No, I do not. But I do believe it can hear our conversations. That's how it knows our every move. But it is only present on this property. [horses neighing] [John, Junior] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! You know, the fog is awfully thick for this time of day. We made good time. We should be out of the woods soon. [ghostly sighing] [shrieking] [Girl panting] Whoa! Whoa! Betsy! Betsy! Betsy, can you hear me? [horses neighing] Whoa! Whoa! [barks] [snarling] Go! Come on! [growling] [horse neighing] Aah! [barking, growling] [snarling] [screaming] Hyah! [Betsy] It's getting closer. [barking] It's gone. Gone where? [screaming] [horse neighing] Mother? I'm right here, darling. I had the most terrible nightmare. Shh. You were sending me away. Oh, I would never send you away. Mother? Yes, darling? Am I gonna die? No. You're not gonna die. Now, you just rest, sweet girl. Just rest. If this entity can hear us at all times and is in all places-- Then-- there's--there's no escaping it. [Lucy] You care for her, don't you, Richard? More than the normal concern of a teacher for a student? Why would you say that? I've seen you look at her. It is true there is no one for a day's ride as comely as your daughter, Lucy. I--I would not presume to think that-- Maybe you should. [laughs] I'm almost 20 years her senior. The same is true of John and me. Can she love me? She will. I'm so afraid for her, Richard. Please, marry her. Your faith in me is flattering, Lucy. Please. But I could not, with good conscience, marry Betsy merely to be her protector. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Richard reading] "After that night... "something changed. "The attacks on Betsy became less violent. "The entity now took out its rage on John, "while leavin' Betsy in an almost lifeless state. [strange female voices] John... Help her... She suffers... [Girl crying] No, no! You must help her... Precious? [Female voice] Help her. Oh! [Female voice] Gonna die. [grunts] [Female voice] You're gonna die, John. [eerie laugh] Your precious. Your precious. [whispering] [Richard reading] "The entity wouldn't let anyone try to help Betsy "when she was under its control. "I felt powerless. "John wouldn't listen. "He fought it. And in return, he was made to suffer." [creak] [Female voice] You know the truth. See! Betsy! Open the door! Betsy! [creak] Betsy. [crying] [wailing] [panting] [Betsy crying] Help me! Betsy? Mm... [thunder] [footsteps] Kate Batts. Call back your Furies. Spare my family. Take it. Exact your pound of flesh. I beg you. End your curse. Please. I put no curse on you or your family. You cursed yourself, John Bell. [gun clicks] Oh... [gun clicks] [sobbing] [Girl whispering] Betsy... [whispering] [whispering] Betsy, remember... [footsteps] [rain falling] [screaming] [screaming] [door closes] [crying] Precious. [crying] [thunder] [thunder] Mama always was a heavy sleeper. [female voice] I was born from the union of evil and innocence. Part of her soul died the night John took her innocence. Avenge me. Make him pay for what he has done to us. [thunder] [creaking] [choking, coughing] [Betsy] Take it. Thank you. [gasping] [creaking] You sleep so soundly you don't even feel me get out of bed. This is Betsy's. My mess. I'll clean it. [gasp] [Richard reading] "After that night, Betsy never heard from the entity again." Mom? Mom? Dad's here. I'm leaving. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Bye, Mom. Bye. Help her. David... David! David! [screaming] Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
