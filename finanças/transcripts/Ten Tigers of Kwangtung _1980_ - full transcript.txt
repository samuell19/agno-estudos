Seventh Uncle, you told me once to attack the juniors first to lure out the old ones. That's the plan! But we can't do it now. Now five of them are together so the odds are against us. Wait until each of them is alone so we will have a better chance. If we can't do it tonight, there's still tomorrow. We must be patient; once we hit, we can't miss. Yes. Stop, let go!

Seventh uncle, those guys are all drunk. This Tan guy is the only one awake. We can do it now. Let's pretend we don't know each other. We'll start arguing over money. Tan is the attendant of the gambling house. He will surely come over, then we can strike. How dare you cheat me! So what? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm gonna beat you up! Beat me up? Fine! Let's take it outside! Let's go! Don't fight, we're all here for fun. I have to. I have to. Just try! Brother, don't pick fights. What if I do? You want to fight? No one is afraid of you! He's dead. He stabbed him with a knife! He's dead. They're getting away. Bad news! Wake up! Hurry! Tan Cong has been killed. What? Liang Xiaohu, the son of Liang Sigui, avenging his father's death. It's my fault! I shouldn't drink so much. All of us drank too much! You are not the only one to blame. Who is the son of Liang Sigui? I've heard Master mention this before. It all started because of Cai Minyi, an anti-Qing fighter. Ku Feng as Cai Minyi Wang Lung Wei as Liang Sigui Wang Lung Wei as Liang Sigui Listen up! Whoever catches this rebel, will be aptly rewarded. Mr. Cai, I am Li Renchao. Brother Renchao, you are a hero. I don't want to lie to you. Cai Minyi is my false name. I am Zhu Hongying from the Tiandihui. Our revolt in Hunan and Guangxi failed. Ti Lung as Li Renchao Ti Lung as Li Renchao I know. Please take a seat. The Qing government regards me as the most wanted traitor. I think you... Mr. Cai, don't worry! Just stay here for now! I'll find a way to send you abroad. Great. I intended to travel to the cities in Southeast Asia, to promote a revolution against the Qing. Mr. Cai, for your safety, you'd better not leave this room. This is my secret chamber, for storing valuable goods pawned by customers. This is a pawn shop? Yes. I am the owner of this pawn shop. Xinheng Pawn Shop Good morning, Master Tan! Fu Sheng as Tan Min Fu Sheng as Tan Min Morning! Are you practicing Three-Cut Fist? Follow me, follow me... Here it is! Let's go in! Go in...! How much do you want for these ragged clothes? Five silver taels. Five silver taels? Aren't you greedy? Be charitable, my eighty-year-old mother is sick and dying. Give him a receipt. These...ragged clothes? Do it. You take it from here. They accepted it! I want to pawn this for two taels. Some more here. I'll write it. Go ask Tan Min, to find out where they came from. You finally got smart. As long as you don't dodge, I won't hit you. Boss's idea is great! That's true. Li Renchao wants to do charity. Xinheng Pawn Shop will be out of business in less than a year. That's true. That's true. Wait! Were you causing trouble? Not me! Dong Sheng Pawn Shop Boss Zhou told us to do so. Do you deserve a beating? Yes... Yes... If you don't fight back, you will each receive a single punch. If you fight back, we'll have to finish it. Who wants to fight back? No! No... We don't dare! With your Three-Cut Fist, these people can't bear even half a punch. Forgive whenever you can. Let it go. Are you looking for Brother Li? Tu Lung as Huang Chengke; Wei Bai as Huang Qiying Yes Tu Lung as Huang Chengke; Wei Bai as Huang Qiying Get lost! Dong Sheng Pawn Shop Dong Sheng Pawn Shop What? You are all idiots. All idiots! Useless! Get lost! One day you'll see. Brother Renchao, I'm duty-bound to do this. I'd like to get some more help. Wang Yinlin of Xia Style Fist and Su Heihu at Mi Pu Pier. Wang Yinlin and Su Heihu both have unique kung fu skills. But I wonder whether they would be willing to help. What do you want from Su Heihu and Wang Yinlin? I know where they are. I'll go and bring them here. If they refuse to come, I'll beat them until they say yes! Tan Min is a straight-forward guy; He easily gets into trouble. That's why I didn't tell him about Mr. Cai. I've heard that because of his quick temper, his grandfather, Tan Yijun, won't teach him kung fu. It's true. He learned his kung fu secretly. He practices very hard at my place every day. He's virtually never home. Sun Chien as Wang Yinlin 7 x 7 = 49 blossom poles. 27 high, 22 low. This is the Lama Clan's reknowned Dipper Formation. You must be Wang Yinlin, right? You are? Tan Min. I've heard of you. You are too kind. Come! My brother Li Renchao, Huang Qiying and Huang Chengke of Bao Zhilin, want to see you. Aren't you coming down? Let's go. You hit me? It's easier to fight on level ground. Tan Min, stop! If I stop I'll be dead. Brother Wang, please stop! He can't stop, either. Master Wang, I apologize! I'm Li Renchao! I've heard Mr. Li is highly skilled. You alone are enough to deal with me. Why would you need these two masters from the Bao Zhilin? You're mistaken. Brother Renchao has an urgent matter that needs your help! He has come especially to see you. Is this a courtesy call? You do me too much honor, please go back. Tan Min, come here and apologize to Master Wang. You can do it yourself. I am going to look for Su Heihu. Lu Feng as Su Heihu Mi Pu Pier What are you doing? Looking for trouble? Want to fight? Well! I came here for Su Heihu. I know this pier is his domain. Seeing how rude you are, it makes me want to teach you a lesson. Master, there's a guy here stirring up trouble! He is beating us up. Who dares to cause trouble here? He must have been alone and you bullied and provoked him. That's him. Stop! Su Heihu? Who are you? Tan Min. Three-Cut Fist has its merits. What? I'll show you how lethal it can be! You're not good enough yet to stir up trouble at Mi Pu Pier. Is Li Renchao here? Li Renchao, why don't you come out? Okay, still unreasonable. Still putting on an act? Let it go, let it go, Brother Li. I don't think Su Heihu is any good. We don't need his help. Are you Su Heihu? Had I known this, I would have drowned you. But you failed and had to take a punch from me. What? Master Su, it's all Tan Min's fault. I apologize on his behalf. What happened? Su Heihu comes to cause trouble. Huang Chengke and Wang Yinlin, you'd help fight him if we're good friends. We should beat you up instead. Heihu, Tan Min's temper is like this. I've reprimanded him, please forgive him and let it go. His Three-Cut Fist is very deadly! If I had not lured him into the water... This is Zhu Hongying from the Tiandihui. His revolt failed in Guangxi and Hunan, so he changed his name to Cai Minyi to hide. I am sorry my affairs have caused you trouble. All martial arts in Guangdong, though belonging to different sects, have all originated from Shaolin. Besides, it's about the revival of our nationhood, we should help each other. Mr. Cai, excuse me for being blunt. If I hadn't known, that's one thing. Since I know it now, I have to be involved. Right! Don't tell anyone about this. The Qing government is searching everywhere for him. We must be extremely careful. That's true. Now you are the one I'm most concerned about. We will meet once a day to exchange ideas. We should meet at night to avoid being seen. Dong Sheng Pawn Shop Please come in. Please! What's Su Heihu here for? Please come in! Take good care of the customers. Sir, you are here! Come! Please come in! Why isn't she coming? Sir, she's coming! Be patient! Don't try to fool me. Sir! Sir! A toast to you. Please... Please! Xiaohong, if you can't get Master Liang, to finish all three glasses of wine, you aren't flirting enough. That's right. Sir, let's drink! Master Liang isn't in a good mood today. You'd better leave us alone. A wanted criminal, has hidden himself in the city, yet we've not been able to find him. Who is he? He'll be executed upon his arrest, and I will be promoted three ranks. Boss Zhou, I was chasing the criminal the other night, but he disappeared near your pawn shop. Are you harboring him? An accusation like that could cost me my life. It's no joking matter! No? Why are you so scared? Sir! My master said because of this, my father, Uncle Wong, Uncle Su, and Uncle Tan, were all involved. For the sake of honor and justice, they helped Mr. Cai. I heard the rest of the story from my master. Kuo Ching as Beggar Su I'm a traveler, newly arrived. I will try to please you with a few tricks. Please be generous and spare a few coins to buy drinks. All right! Yang Shiung as Tie Qiao San Please don't laugh if I don't do well. Great. What are you laughing at? What kind of kung fu is this? It's more like somersaulting on an opera stage. Eh? I see the people in Guangzhou don't know what kung fu is. I've come to the wrong place. This is the Skyhigh Golden Scissortail Legs. How could you say nobody knows? You have keen eyes. It's a shame there's only one of you. There's me too. But your Golden Scissortail Legs is no big deal. Kiddo, how many years have you been practicing? Why? Want to fight? I have a rule. If you don't fight back, you'll only need to take one punch from me. If you do fight back and l kill you, it's your own fault. If you are able to punch me even once, I'll ram my own head on the street and kill just to show you. Deal! If I can't hit you once, I'll ram my head to show you too. Done! It's a deal! A deal! Watch my punch! Master Li! If Master Tan can't hit that beggar, he'll have to kill himself. You'd better take a look. Over there. Kill yourself now! You missed me, so you have to die. You lost! Do you deny it? You lost! Do you deny it? Tan Min! What are you up to this time? He lost. He should kill himself. Which part of me did you hit? You... You... Two against one! You're bullying an out-of-towner. That can't be the way. I am here to reconcile the fight. You have to pass me first. Tie Qiao San? Exactly! What are you doing? Fighting in broad daylight? Have you no respect for the law? We're just playing. Li Renchao, you stopped abruptly. Weren't you afraid I would attack from behind? If Tie Qiao San did such a despicable thing, you would not be called Tie Qiao San. Are you all right? Yes! Master! Come here, please. You are both so skilled! Please come to my place, have some tea and talk a while. All right! All right! Dong Sheng Pawn Shop Dong Sheng Pawn Shop Tea? Don't you have wine? Yes, yes! Bring some good wine. The more the better. Bring the whole jar. Yes. You're both so good. You broadened my horizons today. Master Liang, I've long heard of your Tie Qiao reputation, which has been well illustrated. And this gentleman is...? Drink as much as you want. I am Su Chen, also known as Beggar Su. With such great abilities, you should open a martial arts school here and spread your fame. I will cover the costs. Bao Zhi Mansion Bao Zhi Mansion Chiang Sheng as Zou Yusheng Please! Eight Diagram Pole? Are you Zou Yusheng? Golden Scissortail Legs. You are Su Chen? People call me Beggar Su. I love the art of fighting. Me, too. I also love wine. Wine is my life. I love gambling, too. Ji Qing Gambling House Please try your luck inside. Open! Ten at the front; Double-twelve at the rear. Open! Open...! Open yours! Smaller...smaller... The host wins all. The host wins. Keep going... The next hand will open immediately. Get lost! Get lost! The great host is here. Step aside! Why?

Gamble with me? With what? Whatever you want! If you can turn these two tiles over, then you win. What will I win? If you win, these two fingers will be yours. Beggar, what do we need these two fingers for? To go with our wine. Good idea! Let's gamble! Get up! I won. Cut off your fingers! Come over! Someone is going to cut off the fingers. You lose and renege on your bet? Oh, you're Zou Yusheng! Right! Aren't you ashamed? These two fingers already belong to me. You didn't even ask permission to use them Bring a knife and cut these two fingers off. Damn! These fingers are so useful. Bullshit! They'll become useless when you cut them off. No use at all? So what is your suggestion, Beggar? Forget it! Let him keep them! Thank you! Thank you! Bullshit! These are my fingers! Screw your crocodile tears! If you bet, prepare to lose. It was our fault at first. We were all drunk when we came in. Now we're sober after all these arguments. Just ask him to pay for the drinks. You're right! That's no big deal. I have plenty of money!

Great leg technique! Great finger power! Great finger power! This is...? Iron Fingers Chen. Zou Yusheng, stop fighting! See you again soon. Wait! Who ordered you to stir up trouble here? Is that a joke? Who could order Master Zou around? So that's it? These four men are suspicious. We have important matters to attend to. Must be careful. Who is the one that knew finger kung fu? Iron Finger Chen is a bodyguard at the gambling house. Let's go in first. Stand still. It's Master Wang. It's me! What's the matter? No. Chief Liang ordered us to watch strangers closely. Sorry, Master Wang. Let's go. Let's go. Yes, sir. Officers are searching everywhere. Strangers are stirring up trouble here again and again. It's dangerous for Mr. Cai to stay here any longer. Bau Ji Lin is highly regarded in Guangzhou. How about moving to Bau Ji Lin? It's not safe, either. I've got a better idea. Three Saints Martial Club Bravo! Bravo... Great! Excellent... Boss Zhou! We've long heard Master Liang's and Master Chen's reputations. Please demonstrate a few of your skills to broaden our horizons. Gentlemen. After you. Zhou Dong Sheng. Yes, sir. I don't care what kind of business you do, but how dare you open a martial club? I can't turn a blind eye. A private martial club is prohibited by the court. Sir, there are so many private martial clubs out there, too numerous for the authorities to do anything about. I am doing this to let them slaughter each other, as my service to the court. My martial artists are highly skilled, and can fight against Li Renchao. I've told you to monitor Xinheng Pawn Shop. What have you found? Nothing yet. But we can use the martial club, to stir up trouble between them. Let them fight. We'll see a clearer picture in time. So that means you are on the side of the court? Sir, you're brilliant. Great. Let me know as soon as you hear something. Yes, sir. Be my guest. I want some, too. Xiaohong, have a seat. I have something important to tell you. This is my friend. We're brothers in life and death. He wants to hide out here temporarily, so l'd like to reserve you for a time. However much it costs, I will double it. But you can't leak any information out. If it's troublesome, we'll leave now. Master Li, no need to leave. I only have one condition. Please name it. I won't ask what trouble this gentleman is in, I'll keep my word but I want Master Li to redeem my freedom after it's all over. Get me out of the brothel. Sure. It's settled. No need, no need! Ask sixth madam to come here. Mr. Cai, you can ease your mind. Xiaohong is chivalrous and she'll take care of everything. You'll be safe here. You two guard Mr. Cai here. Yinlin, I totally trust you. Tan Min, I want you to stay here, and don't move an inch. Okay! Keep firmly in mind. Waiter, those two don't come often, right? Never been here before. People are trying to eat and they are running around, with no manners. They even want to stay on long term. There'll be more trouble. Stay for long? Yes. Xinheng Pawn Shop's Master Li brought them here. One of them even reserved Xiaohong long term. Never saw that person before, either. Reserved Xiaohong? Baby, I forgot there's something important I haven't finished yet. I'll come back and see you later. What's your opinion? I think one of them, is the one you want to arrest. I have a plan. Zou Yusheng and Iron Finger Chen, have a grudge against Tan Min. I'll incite them to cause trouble at the brothel. Then you can deploy the troops outside, and you will... Up there. Tan Min, you're a bastard! Come down if you dare. Come down now. Come on! Brother Li urged us again and again not to cause trouble. Are you afraid of us? Useless cowards. Right! Are you afraid of us? Don't have the guts? Brother Li told us not to leave the brothel. But they came here to pick on us. How can I just let it go? You... Beat him up! Beat him up! Hit him! Let me! Li Renchao, why don't you come out? Brother Li is not here. Officer Liang is here, step aside! You're criminals! This is a disturbance of the peace! I'm authorized to quash this gathering! No one is allowed to leave! Damn! The authorities are here! Let's hurry back and protect Mr. Cai! Search for the rebel! After him! After him! Go! Don't move. Run now! Run now! Let's Go! Tie Qiao San, I've always regarded you as a Jianghu hero. I never would've guessed you were working for the court as a rat! What! You are insulting me! Didn't they just bring the troops for the arrest? Let's go! Let's go! We only came to fight with Tan Min. We know nothing about the troops. Boss Zhou! Why are the troops here? Spill it! What the hell? Conspiring with authorities? We won't let you use us! Take your hands off me first. I'll tell you how serious the matter is. Li Renchao is sheltering someone. You want us to catch him for the authorities? That's not what I mean. That person is my enemy. He has done a lot of evil things. He burned my ancestral house, and killed my wife. If I knew of his whereabouts, wouldn't I report it to the authorities? This rogue is protected by Li Renchao! I'm afraid even the authorities won't be able to arrest him. Honor is important among heroes. Please help me with this matter. Murder and arson cannot be forgiven. If you catch him, I'll reward you generously. Do you think we do it for money? We're friends. I'll never forget what you've done for me. Don't worry. We'll take care of it. Let's go! We can't stay in the city any longer. Su Heihu, prepare our escape according to our plan. Yes! Mr. Cai, please. Gentlemen, I have some important business. We'll settle everything later. All right. But leave this person with us. You work for the authorities? Authorities or not, he can't leave. None of you can leave! Masters, take him with you. Yes! Fight! Take him with you. Mr. Cai, go to Mi Pu Pier quickly! Heroes, stop please! If you want to take me back for the reward, I'll go with you. Who wants the reward? It's because you've committed such cardinal sins. Murder! Arson! Wait. What did you just say? Do you know who he is? An evil criminal. Stop! Tie Qiao San, he is Mr. Cai Minyi. You're not just a Jianghu hero, but were once a part of the revolution. Don't you know who Cai Minyi is? Mr. Cai, I heard your revolution failed in Hunan, and you've been pursued by the Qing regime all the way to the south. Friends in Hunan have written to us. I never thought it was you. I deserve to die! Why are you stopping me? Of course I can't let you hit my friend. You are Mr. Cai Minyi? Zhu Hongying of the Tiandihui? Enough questions! We've been fooled by Zhou Dong Sheng. Where are you going? I'm going to kill that bastard, Zhou Dong Sheng. Don't be rash. The most important thing to do now is to send Mr. Cai away. That's right. When we get to the Mi Pu Pier, Su Heihu will have a boat waiting for Mr. Cai. Mr. Cai will be safe then. But the government troops will definitely block the way. Master Li, what do you take us for? If you can do it, why can't we? Right. You're right. Follow me. Liang Sigui intended to create some misunderstanding between masters and uncles. But they sorted it all out in the end. Rotten luck for them! What should we do now? Hire a substitute and take a day off at the pier tomorrow. The four of us should look around, to see if there's anyone suspicious. See how things go first, and then ask our masters for guidance. Should we close the stall in front of the Guangxiao Temple tomorrow? It'll attract more attention if it's closed all of a sudden. You'd better deal with it tomorrow. You can get some help from Tie Tou. Chao Ming and I will look around first before joining you. Just close the stall earlier. Okay. This is it. Seventh Master! Mr. Chen! Master, this must be young master Liang. That's right. Xiaohu, this is Mr. Chen Wen Jie from the Jing Wen sect. He and Chen Dajun are distant cousins. Mr. Chen! Don't worry, Mr. Chen is one of us. Have a seat please! Come, come, come... Let's gamble! They'll talk for while. Let's play. Brother Liang, don't worry! I am only remotely related to Chen Dajun, Jing Wen sect and Wu Dang have a close relationship. Besides, I've been well taken care of by Seventh Master, so I will do my best for you. Mr. Chen. You accompanied my late father for a long time. Please advise. You are too kind. But what happened to your father, I know many details, perhaps more than you. I was just about to ask. Officer Liang was a skilled fighter from Wu Dang. His kung fu was deadly. However, the Ten Tigers figured out their misunderstandings, and joined hands against your father. Mi Pu Pier Li Renchao, I knew you'd come. I've been waiting for you a while. Li Renchao, you left the brothel in a hurry last time. I must have a good spar with you this time. Brother Renchao, I've made adequate preparations, feel free to make your best move. Great. I'd like to see how good your Wu Dang swordsmanship is. This is what happened. I must take revenge. That's obvious. Why else are we here? We are outnumbered, so we must use our wits. Let's follow the plan and take it step by step. First we squash the juniors and then lure out the old ones. Don't stir up the hornets' nest. Otherwise they'll join hands against us, and repeat the same scenario from years ago. Seventh Uncle, you're right. The Tan kid died today! We need to separate them and strike as suddenly as lightning. In that way, they'll be caught unawares. Those guys working at the Mi Pu Pier always have morning tea here. Mr. Chen and I will wait for Chen Dajun here. Meanwhile, you should wait up at Guangxiao Temple, for Lin Fucheng and Lin Bing! Yes! Guangxiao Temple Yes! Guangxiao Temple Yes! Guangxiao Temple Hit the gong! Gentlemen! Come see a performance! Come over! Dear neighbors, seniors and friends, come closer if you are interested. Please give me some applause if I perform well. If not, please don't boo me off! Excuse me! Excuse me! All right! All right! Come, come! Over here! Listen up. I have some urgent business to attend to today, so you have to help me out for one day. No problem. I'll pay you and this meal is on me. Help yourself. Enjoy. Dajun, I'm looking for you. I knew you'd be here. Brother Wen, what brings you here? Excuse me, come over here! Come... Sit. What happened? I wanted to tell you that I won the lottery! Really? Congratulations. So we must celebrate today. Take a day off. After the morning tea, let's have a nice meal and then go to Qi Hua Square. Have a feast and enjoy the beautiful flowers. Thank you. I did take a day off. But I have urgent business to attend to today. What urgent business? More important than going to Chi Hua Square and drinking? Chen, go and have fun. I'll take your place today. Let's go! Thanks a lot. Please. See how helpful your brothers are? Sit down. Have some tea first and we can discuss it. Brother Wen, I really can't. You've already taken a day off anyway. Just ignore that urgent business. Sit! Sit! Sit! No. A brother got killed last night. I really have no time for this today. You don't respect me? What? You win the lottery and now speak in this tone? Mr. Chen, he's an insolent fool. Don't waste our time. So you didn't win the lottery. You are working for someone else. Last night, Tan died. Today it's your turn. Mr. Chen, please step outside. Tell the customers it's an official business. No one is allowed to come close. Yes, yes... Don't watch! Hurry out! Seems like you are the killer from last night. You are smart. Is your surname Liang? Master Liang is elsewhere. You must have heard of my name, Dong Qi. I heard about you before. I must try, your kung fu today. Not allowing you to choose a weapon, I've taken a slight advantage over you. In our Heihumen sect, whatever I have in hand, becomes my weapon! Well. Then don't blame me for an unfair duel. You can't go in. You can't go in. We are here for tea. You can't go in. Arresting a criminal inside. Mr. Tong is dealing with a criminal inside, so go somewhere else. Leave. Okay. Okay. Let's leave. Go away. Let's go. They killed him! They killed him! Come take a look! He's dead. He died a cruel death. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Thank you! Here! A big tip for us. Brother, looks like you practice kung fu, too. Right! But... But... Not as good as you. You're too kind. Do you want me to show you some of my kung fu? Sure! With this money from you, I can close up earlier anyway. Wrap up. Thank you for your patronage. Thank you. Come again tomorrow. Please show your skill. Murder! Murder! It's him! It's him! Murder! Step aside! Step aside! Out of the way. Don't panic. It's a confidential order to wipe out the Shaolin rebels. Everyone go about your business. If the rebels come again, don't mention what has just happened. Whoever mentions it, will be sent to prison immediately. Hurry and leave. Don't cause any more trouble. Seventh uncle! I know Lin Fucheng hasn't shown up yet. Let me leave first. You stay here and keep a close watch. Take those corpses away. Yes! Come, come, come...! Don't look! Don't look! Get lost! Where's Lin Fucheng? Who is looking for Lin Fucheng? I am... I'm here for Lin Fucheng. And Lin Bing. The two brothers have to, make arrangements for a friend's funeral today, so they asked me to take their place. What's your name, please? My last name is Lin! Lin Xiaofu! So your name is also Lin? We are cousins! A lot of people go by that name. Come on. Lin is a popular surname. Why are you looking for Lin Fucheng? To practice kung fu with him. Practice? Maybe I can practice with you. Lin Fucheng's kung fu is marvelous. He was a student of Tie Qiao San! After Tie Qiao San died, he practiced under Beggar Su. Lin Bing is one of Wang Yinlin's favorite students. Of all the Ten Tigers' kung fu, they learned the most. That's true. Lin Fucheng is really good. Of course. He is great. Since you are one of the Lin brothers, you must know the Tigers' kung fu. Well, I do know a bit. Great. We admire the Ten Tigers' kung fu styles. Look! What are you doing? Thank you. This is Tie Qiao San's kung fu style. A stable stance. Strong arms. He was known as the "Iron Bridge." This is how he trains. Try it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Light them up. Okay. Okay. Steady. A lot of smoke, right? Close your eyes. Steady. How come you are so useless? Why did you burn me? You have no endurance at all. I don't think you can learn Tie Qiao San's kung fu style. Let's try something else. Try Wang Yinlin's kung fu from Lama Clan. Having fun? Let me tell you, Lama Clan's pole style, is different from the common Blossom pole style. Although it's Dipper pole style, there's no wooden pile here. Let's use the wine pot instead. What are you doing? Thank you. Thank you. Come. Don't move. Come on. Why are you doing this? Just practicing Master Su's kung fu style. We'd better leave. Don't be scared, I'm going to teach you kung fu. Training in kung fu is hard work. I can tell you now I am Lin Fucheng. This is my Brother Wang Chaoming. He's the son of Wang Yinlin. I see. You lied to me. You didn't give me a fair chance to fight. Fair chance? When you killed, did you ever think of giving them a fair chance? Hurry and go before the government troops come! Let him down! Let him down! Yes. Do you understand what you've been told to do? Yes. We can't follow you all the time. If you want to lure Tong out in the open, you have to be prepared for any given situation. Yes, Master. Go.

Xiao Lin, there has been constant trouble these past two days. How can you still be in the mood to fight? Brat, would you still eat if there's trouble? Of course, I would. Of course, I would. Same with fighting. You're a brat! You're trash! I am a human being, not trash! Great! Let's fight! Good! Good! Good! You broke my stool. Stop pretending! Wang Chaoming and Lin Fucheng! I know all about you. So what? Let's fight for real. How stupid of me. Dong Qi is here, naturally Tong Ba would be here, too. Not really that stupid. You're right, I'm Master Tong Ba. Catch!
