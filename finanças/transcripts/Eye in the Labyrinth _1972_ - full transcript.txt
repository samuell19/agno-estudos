(dramatic music) (rumbling) (electronic beeping) (siren wailing) (pleasant music) (anxious music) - Now look... (dramatic music) (anxious music) (knife thumping) (groaning) (dramatic music) (perky music) Nein, no you can't do it! No! No, no (sobs)! (anxious music) (panting) (knife thumping) (groaning) (telephone ringing) (groaning) - Lucas! (telephone ringing) Yes, Lucas? No he isn't here, he must, he must be at the clinic. You're welcome. (distant laughing) - Well the doctor hasn't arrived yet, we've been expecting him since yesterday. You may try again later. Oh Julie, isn't Lucas with you? - No, I was hoping he'd be here. - Come. To be frank I thought that congress was just an excuse to spend a few days with you. - No, he told me he wanted to go alone. Oh... - Well I don't mind telling you I may be too worried, he has a whole lot of patients waiting for him, with appointments. - I had a nightmare of a dream, something horrible's happened to him! Listen you must know where he is, he tells you everything, where he goes, what he does-- - Julie dear, I assure you-- - Where did he go? - I don't know, I thought he was with you! - Don't you know where the doctor is, he is at Maracudi, there is no doubt! At Maracudi! Head to Maracudi! - All right, all right now! - He takes his own, direct to Maracudi! - You're going back to your room, yes! - I tell you - Come on, come on! - tough guys, at Maracudi! - You're right, take it easy, - I know he's at Maracudi! come on (mumbles)! (hits thudding) - Where is this, Maracudi? - I think it's a name he invented, that's all. He likes making up words. - Who are you? How did you get in here? - Where's Lucas Bernhard? - [Julie] I don't know. - Where is he hiding? - What do you want him for? - I'm asking the questions! (gasping) Well, where is he? - I don't know, I swear! Oh! (smacking) (whimpering) (smacking) - [Man] Better not call the police about this. If you do I'll kill you. (dark enigmatic music) (dramatic music) - Maracudi... (energetic music) (anxious music) Lucas! (car door clattering) (perky jazz music) (horn honking) Fill it up please! - Eh, oil and water okay? - Yes, how much? - Give me three. But uh, we know each other senorina, no? - No. - Hey! (enigmatic music) (dramatic music) (enigmatic music) (pinball machine thumping) - [Julie] Do you recognize him? - You say he's a German and has an accent? - Yes, he must have been here three or four days ago. - Hmm, I don't remember seeing him. - May I see it senorina? No I'm sorry but I've never seen him. (payphone clattering) - Would you like (speaking foreign language)? - Um, a (speaking foreign language), yes. - It's me again, is he there? Let me speak to him. Uh, Senorina! I wanted to tell you there is somebody in town, that maybe can help you. - Who? - Somebody. Is okay? - Let's go. - This is the house, this one here. - Hey where do I go, whom do I ask for? - It doesn't matter, go to the first floor, it's the door on the left. (hinges creaking) (footsteps echoing) (cat screeching) (anxious enigmatic music) (knocking) (crackling) (screaming) (footsteps echoing) (gasping) (wooden cracking) - Oh, oh! (crashing) (cacophonous dramatic music) - Hey! Who are you running to like that? You look terribly scared, what's the matter? - Someone tried to kill me, and stole my bag! - Who, did you see who it was? - No, could be the man who took me there. - Who are you looking for? - Oh it's someone. - Your husband? - No, a psychiatrist from Milan. His name is Lucas Bernhard. - Then how come you're looking for him around here? Why don't you go to the police, you can tell them about that bag of yours too. - No I couldn't do that 'cause I'm a foreigner, my visa's expired, it would just make trouble for me. - I'm something of a foreigner myself. I was in the states for 25 years. - Is there a hotel or something around here? - (laughs) A hotel? Have you taken a good look at this place? But if you would like a room, perhaps I could suggest the house of a lady friend of mine. It isn't much, but if you don't mind? Come. It's that building there. Now don't go getting any crazy ideas. Nobody's trying to kill you, pieces of that building keep falling down every day. - Well then why did that man take me there? - He's a kind of a nut. Here it is, this place used to be mine at one time. Now it's an orphanage. - You needn't worry, she'll be all right here with me, she's a beautiful young lady, isn't she! Saro! Frank, go with Saro, bring in her bags. Saro! - My bags are in the car. - Oh then give him the keys. Move, can't you hear when someone calls you! Go with Senor Frank! - I'll ask around and try to scrape up some news for you. Uh, by the way, what's your name? - Julie. - Nice name. - Come please let's hurry Senorina! Senorina, do let me show you to your room. Then I must get back to the children, there are 25 of them and I do have my hands full, believe me! I hope you'll be comfortable here Senorina! (enigmatic anxious music) The children love to paint. Most of them are not very talented but three or four of them, are quite good. Oh we've had visitors here only a few weeks ago, they bought three paintings, they liked them so much. And you know much they paid us? 20,000 lire for each painting, can you imagine? - It's the medical inspector. - Oh yes I'd forgotten! Excuse me. (servant coughing) I'll only be a moment. And darling if you would like to purchase any one of them, I'll make you a good price. - Eh, excuse me, Senor Franco will be here in a minute. I got a present for you! - [Julie] Oh, thank you, but why give it to me, you can sell it? - It's for you, to have. - Oh hello! - Look, (chuckles), it was in the rubble. - Oh, thank you! - I must say you've got a lively imagination! Better take a look and see if everything's there. - The money's still there. - Hmm. - The photograph's missing! - The one of that doctor you were looking for? - Yes that's right. - So it's that important to you, eh? That important? - Yes. - You know something, I've been giving a lot of thought to this business of yours. - Why should you bother with it? - 'Cause I like you (chuckles), you're a nice kid. Now listen to me, if you're boyfriend was here, you can be sure he was heading for Gerda Hartman's villa. A whole lot of people go there, writers, painters. You know, that crowd. It's a big villa, right on the water. The type of place they'd put up in California. There was a time that was mine too. - Why don't you come and show me the way? - Me? No no, I couldn't go there. - Oh... - But I can tell you how to get there. - Oh yes please! (dramatic music) (cacophonous enigmatic music) (water splashing) (speaking foreign language) (chattering in foreign language) (laughing) (chuckling) - You can get here by the road too, you know. - I wanted to swim, I didn't see anyone there. Those kids took my clothes! - A naked woman doesn't have to go into explanations especially if she's as young, and beautiful as you. My name is Gerda, and this is my villa. (tense music) - Allo. Allo? - (chuckles) It's no use, they're all wearing ear plugs. I'll do the introductions later. They're all utterly disconnected for the moment. - Come here you lousy tramp! (gasping) - Kill me tomorrow, tonight let me live! - You'll die now! - Give me half an hour! - You shall die, with no mercy! - Please, my last little prayer? - It's too late! Ah, you're an old ham. You've been hitting it off with Eugene. It's written all over your face. Well at least you can say if you liked it or not? - First, I didn't go to bed with him. Second, he isn't my cup of tea. Third, even if I had, I still wouldn't tell you. (camera clicking) - Will you quit bothering me? - I'm interested in your feet. - You through? - I'm finished now. - Louis, Louis your cigarette. You might as well open your mouth, or you want me to smoke it for you? (sighing) He's said to have Aztec blood in his veins. He's absolutely beautiful don't you think? - Yes. - Oh about this Dr. Lucas, Lucas Bernhard, oh, no, never saw him. Never heard of him, he was certainly never here, I can assure you. Don't know him. Uh, who told you to come here? - A man in the village, his name is Frank. He was very sweet about it really. - Oh yes, he's a very sweet person. I know he's a born rogue! An ex-gangster who was kicked out of the United States. - Well I'm sorry, I feel as though I've been gate crashing. I'd better be on my way. - Oh, you're mad! You mean you want to drive away at this hour? (chuckling) Wait at least until tomorrow. Don't you like it here, must you go now? - No, not really. - Why be in such a hurry to leave then? Nice place, nice people. - Ha, she's lying, she hates us all. - [Gerda] Ah, pay no attention to him, he always says the opposite of what he thinks. - Go on. - You mean, you mean to tell me that you've been recording everything we've been saying? - Don't worry, noises are what I'm after, not words. I don't give a shit about what you've been saying. My music is composed from the sounds of nature. Crickets, birds, thunder, the human voice. - (chuckles) He's a composer, and a great success in the off-beat nightclubs. His great ambition of course is to be performed at La Scoda. Thomas and Corin, they're sort of a blond and Heloise, or drift down (mumbles). Actors of mimicry, they've performed up on Broadway and in Greenwich Village and get more and more off every season. Now that they've had their fight for the day, now they'll make up in bed. He's got to fight with her first or he just doesn't, function. - Some people take a lot more than that, to get it up. (perky exotic music) - I can't take anymore of this. I'm going to hit the sack, goodnight. - Me too. - They're really going to bed you know, separately that is. What are you doing? - There's a book up on the shelf with an old binding. The Con-troll-a-tee? - [Gerda] Yes, I think so. - That's funny because I'd given one exactly like it to Lucas, only I'd written a few words on the front page. - This can't be it, it's impossible, it belonged to my first husband. - May I see it? - No. (telephone ringing) I told you it couldn't possibly be yours! (telephone ringing) Hello, eh pronto. It's for you! - For me? Hello? Hello? (pinball machine clattering) Hello? Hello? - Someone at the village? Someone who wants to know if you've left? - No there was no one, it must have been a mistake. I'm going to bed now, I shall be leaving in the morning. - As you like. - Goodnight, thanks for everything. - [Gerda] Thomas? Call the others. (crickets chirping) (sultry mysterious music) (gasping) (door rumbling) - Excuse me Senorina, I thought I heard someone come in from outside. When you're through, please close the light. - Of course. Wait, wait a minute! But wasn't it you who took me up to that house today? - No Senorina. (door rumbling) (motor revving) - Good morning. - Hmm? I thought you had gone. - I decided to stay, if your invitation still holds? - You can stay as long as you want. (enigmatic music) - Hey, what are you doing here? What do you want? - I want to talk to you! - Come on come out of there why are you hiding? - It's Senor Frank, he says he wants to see you. He said it's very important. He's waiting for you at the orphanage! - Hey, come back here! Oh that boy... (distant children shouting) - And this is all I've got left, a room in a basement. (chuckles) In a building that used to be mine. - I hope you didn't ask me here to talk about your private life. - Find out anything? - No not a thing, no one's seen him. - This yours? - Yes! - [Frank] It's him isn't it? - Where'd you get it? - I stole it from Antonio, the guy who took you to that abandoned place. Strange, isn't it? - Everybody seems very strange here. - Try to get them to talk. That Gerda crowd knows something, but be careful of those people, don't trust them. Especially Gerda. - Don't worry about it, I don't trust anyone. - You can trust me any time, if you run into trouble, come to me, I'm you're only ally around here. - You say I can trust you? - Are we allies, hmm? Kiss me. (grunting) - No! - You young little slut! How dare you, and in my house, you son of a-- - Please, wait a minute! Let me explain. You must trust me! (woman sobbing) - Looks like I've found an admirer for my work. - This hand, but it's Lucas's! You can't deny it, it's his scar! - So, is it a crime to take pictures of him? - Why do you keep telling me he wasn't here? - I took these three years ago in Tunis, before you'd ever met him. - Oh I see, I'm sorry. (tantalizing music) (insects chirping) (motor revving) - Frank the gangster? Uh-hmm, he used to be, he was pretty cheap. His real passion is women. - (sighs) Oh I know. - His fancy used to be Gerda. - And then what happened? - That's where I came in. (chuckling) - If you can't stand her, why do you stay here? - Oh she's as good or bad as any other, it's all the same. There are certain advantages with Gerda. - She keeps you? But that shouldn't be difficult. - No, I'm very expensive. - Louis? - Uh? - You were lying, weren't you? Lucas was here. - Yes he was. - Well why won't any of you admit it? - I don't know, that's the way Gerda wanted it. - I see. (motor revving) (camera clicking) - At first I thought he was fooling. We had known each other for ages. By the time I realized what he was after, it was too late. He knew very well I was a virgin and that I had a hang-up about virginity. A complex, or whatever you want to call it. It was the most important thing in my life. That was exactly why he did it, that way, forcing me. I hated him so! As I saw him lying there, I thought of killing him, there, and then. After a while we went back to the villa. By the time I'd come out he had left without saying goodbye. I have never heard from him since. - I've forbidden you to set foot in this house! - You amaze me Gerda, you won't let me set foot in my own house! - It was your house, now it's my house! And in my house people who talk too much are not welcome! I can throw you out whenever I choose! - With a little help from Antonio and his gun. That wouldn't be nice Gerda, seeing as how I brought you a present! - Now what does this mean? You know how much that idiot's pictures get on my nerves! - I don't think you've taken a good look Gerda. Turn it over. (dramatic music) - What does this mean? - It means that the kid has talent. He can paint exactly what he sees, and only what he sees. He can't invent, he's a bit short on imagination. Have you had the same guests around in the last 10 days? - Let's get down to it Frank, what do you want? - Eh it's pretty simple. I want to come back. Not back in your bed, don't worry (chuckles). I mean here, in this house. Just look at that panorama, eh? - What would you do here? You know there's no place for you here anymore! - You'll find a place. We'll go back into business, together, eh? (Frank chuckling) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - We have a call for you from Milan, one moment please. - [Man] Hello? - Hello? - Hello! - Lucas! - Listen I can't hear you! - Hello, how did you know I was here, Lucas? - [Lucas] Let me speak first! I've been trying to contact you! I thought I'd never find you. Hello, can you hear me? - Lucas, hello! Oh, oh please call me back right now! I'll go home immediately! Hello, hello? - Sorry you've been cut off, the line must be out of order. Hello, hello? (anxious music) (crickets chirping) - Louis, I've come to say goodbye. Louis, are you all right? - Oh I feel just great. You wanna take a swim me? - Listen, I have to leave, I'm going back to Milan. Lucas called me. - You mean Lucas telephoned? That's funny. - What's so funny about it? (laughing) - Wait! Better drive by the garage before you leave. - What for? - Do what I told you. But wait till everyone's asleep! Go on, don't ask any questions. (anxious music) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (door handles clicking) (exhaust hissing) (door rumbling) - Open up please, let me out! (metallic rattling) Oh, oh... Please let me out of here! (gasping) (metallic rattling) (hollow pounding) (panting) (coughing) (thumping) (crickets chirping) (anxious music) (exhaust hissing) (coughing) (feverish jazz music) (coughing) (crickets chirping) (distant coughing) (motor rumbling) (coughing) (door rumbling) - I got to you just in time! (grunting) (coughing) Feel any better? You'll be all right! - Some water! Thanks. Lucas's car was in there, he didn't leave. - Eh, I know. It was a trap. Calm down now uh? Try to get some rest. - Please, the medicine in my bag (coughs). (metallic creaking) - Lock the door, and open it to nobody. Understand? Nobody. (sighing) - Why don't you get a poodle? - Mmm, dogs are too intelligent, I prefer your sort. (screaming) Stop it! - Thomas, Eugene's feeling me up. - Eugene's a pig. (enigmatic music) - Good morning. - Good morning my dear. (door rumbling) (dramatic music) - [Lucas] Hello, hello! Listen I can't hear you, let me speak first! I've been trying to contact you. I thought I'd never find you! Hello, can you hear me? - It's the same as what he said to you on the phone, right? - Word for word. - Hmm, there's your answer. They put together a piece of conversation Lucas had with somebody, and mixed in a bit of static. Eugene's a master of turning out stuff like that. Right Eugene? - I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. - About that tape you fixed up to fool Julie. You wanted her to pack up and go, you were afraid she'd find out something, uh? - No, no! - Then you changed your mind, you thought how much easier it woud be to kill her, so you set a trap for her in the garage! You're in this with Louis, or maybe he gave you the idea without meaning to! - Frank you're crazy, I have nothing to do with this thing! No, no, no no no ! - You're lying! Tell the truth! Tell the truth or I'll kill you-- - No Frank stop it, let him go! You're choking him to death, please! (grunting) - Okay, so I fixed the tape, but I didn't even know what it was for. Gerda asked me to! - Gerda, Gerda! All you ever do is hide behind that woman's skirts! - And Lucas, they're trying to make me believe I killed him but I know they're lying, it isn't so! That night we were all sitting in the living room after supper, Lucas was there. We began playing one of those games where you have to tell the truth when you're asked a question. Lucas was asking them. They were quite ruthless. He asked them in such a way it was impossible to invent lies. He was diabolic. He could pry out your most intimate secrets! Toni was the first one to break down. He succeeded in getting her to reveal things she'd never tell anyone. But it seemed that I was his most interesting Guinea pig, being a psychiatrist. At once he obviously spotted that he could have a high time with me. The game became more like a session of public therapy, with me as his patient. He dragged it all out of me, things nobody ever knew. Things I'd buried away forever. Like the three years I spent in the nut-house, and why I was sent there. I could never forgive him for that. No one knew about that. No one. I didn't want to, but all of a sudden, I seemed to lose control. The only thing I could see in front of me was that little face, not much more than a child. - Remember Eugene, you have to tell us who she was. No harm in that. - No no no no no... - I know perfectly well who but I want you to tell us. Come on Eugene! - She was my daughter Lucy. Lucas went on grilling me. The others had left the room in disgust, and all of a sudden a great wave of fury began stirring up inside me. I couldn't stand it anymore! (screaming) (choking) I didn't know what I was doing! I began to hit him! (hits thudding) But then, I, I don't remember what happened. I, I must have had an attack of something! (whimpering) I don't know, I don't know! (panting) I don't remember anything more of that night. But there's one thing I am certain about, I couldn't have killed Lucas! - What makes you so sure Eugene? - I saw him the next day from the window. He was going down to the sea with Thomas, and Corine. - Everyone saw her go down to the beach with Lucas. But he wasn't with you and Corine when you came back, right? - No, Lucas came back up with us, I swear he did! - You don't have to swear Thomas, tell him the truth! We have nothing to hide. (waves crashing) It's true, we did go down to the water together. Thomas led the way, (relaxing jazz music) and Lucas was right behind me. Thomas went in by himself. But then Lucas told me, he'd rather take a swim in the underwater grotto. I said "Go ahead." So, thinking I was alone, I took off my bathing suit, to sunbath in the nude. But Lucas did not go to the grotto at all. He came back to spy on me! He'd been watching me for some time, always snooping around. He must have guessed something wasn't right, never missed a thing. There was something devilish about him, maybe because he was a psychiatrist. - Why was? - Did I say was? - Answer the question. - Well, you know it's the sort of thing you say when someone is talking about the past. - Yeah, it's like when you're talking about someone who's dead, for instance, uh? - I don't know, I'm telling you everything I know. If you'll only listen. - All right, go ahead. (relaxing jazz music) - [Corine] It isn't easy to tell you this. Lucas found out our secret. I'm a man, but only physically. I feel and think like a woman! I'm not a transvestite, I'm an actress! I'm Thomas's wife, a woman! A woman! I'm not a transvestite (sobs)! - Lucas! - In the heat of the moment, Thomas threatened to kill Lucas if he told anyone. Our careers would have been ruined by the scandal! It would have been the end! Lucas said he couldn't care less about us and our careers! And he ran off over the rocks, and that's the last time we saw him! (waves crashing) (dramatic music) (engine revving) (thumping) (dramatic music) (cacophonous dramatic music) (spear whooshing) (engine revving) - Julie! - Look at this! I found it in the water! Someone tried to kill me, to get rid of me! - Come inside! Eh, it's all my fault! I won't leave you alone anymore. It won't happen again, I promise you. - No, no, no, I want to go away from here! - Where do you want to go? - I don't know. Maybe I'll go to the police with this. - Here, but calm down now you're too upset. I'll keep the shirt. The guy who tried to kill you will try to get it. You must trust me, hear me? (Frank moaning) - That picture, what does it mean? - I found it in Gerda's room. I wanted to show it to you but this wasn't the right moment. Don't be upset, Julie, don't worry. I will explain everything. Julie, please believe me. (Julie gasping) Julie! (Julie grunting) - Let me... Will you let me go! (relaxing music) (insects chirping) (dramatic music) (tantalizing music) (door rumbling) (engine revving) - This is where it was. - Stop it! - If you don't kiss me I won't tell you anything else! I won't! - Listen, I'll kiss you I promise you, but only after you've told me everything that happened. - From up here you can see all the women lying in the sun! Nude! - Eh, did you also see that scene you painted in the picture? - Uh-hmm. - And did you recognize the person with the knife? - Uh-hmm. - Would you tell me who it was? - Will you kiss me first? - Will you please tell me who it was! Listen, will you just tell me, I've got to know! Oh I've had enough of this, you're going with me to the police, they'll make you talk! - [Saro] No! (engine revving) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (engine revving) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) (crashing) (engine revving) (tires screeching) - Saro? (Saro groaning) Saro! You stay still and quiet, don't move! I'll take you to a hospital, it's nothing serious! (Saro groaning) (anxious music) (dramatic music) (frenetic jazz music) Saro! Saro, come on, get up! (mumbling) (Saro screaming) Oh my god! No (sobs)! (sobbing) (weeping) - Julie. Julie how are you, you feeling better? - Oh Louis, help me (sobs)! It was awful! That poor boy! It was all my fault! - Come on now, calm down. (sobbing) (metallic thumping) (rumbling) (engine revving) What are you looking for? - [Julie] I don't know, I... - Lost something? - I have a feeling something's missing, I don't know. - You've really made up your mind then? - I've got to get away from here. I can't stand it a moment longer. I'm afraid of everything and everybody. - Afraid of me too? - No, not of you. But what use could you be? We're both of us too weak, we're defeated right from the start. - Take this. - What is it? - What it looks like. A lump of sugar. Just close your eyes, open your mouth. (engine rattling) - [Julie] What strange colors... - It used to have the same effect on me at first. But know it's something else, I couldn't live without it. - Where'd you get it? - Where do I get it? Why do you think I flop into bed with Gerda every time she wants? Gerda's yacht is a storehouse. It's the drug distribution center for most pushers in this country. - Do the others know about it? - They're all working for her. A little group of eccentrics, artists and actors, kept by a crazy old millionairess. That's the image. - Where does Lucas come into this? - You don't know? Didn't he ever tell you? Ah let's see, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but your illustrious boyfriend was a pusher. A very important pusher. He was Gerda's number one accomplice after Frank left. He worked it from the Milan end. A nasty character, believe me. - You've been dying to get the little boy into bed since the day you came here! Well, how did it go? Did he do his duty, like a man? I shouldn't think so, he's a slug unless he's loaded with acid! Get up! So we are ashamed are we? - Don't hurt her! Leave her alone. - Very well. But now I'm going to tell you the truth. No one killed Lucas, Julie. He left the villa alive. None of us ever saw him again, right Louis? Answer me you fool! You saw him leave! Well did you or didn't you? You saw him go away, answer me! - I saw him go away. - [Gerda] Of course you did. Now get up and go to your room. - Yes, I'll go to my room now. - Do you believe it now? No you don't. But what does it matter anyhow, who'd ever believe you? What proof do you have? - All I want is to be left alone. I want to go away from here. I never want to see any of you ever again. - I know dear. You will leave tomorrow morning. (lock clicking) - Forget it Gerda, it's me. - You frightened me. - Uh, so I frighten you, scare you. Eh well, maybe you're right. - Now what do you want Frank? - Just a little business talk. - I thought we had our business talk. And now I'm going to bed! - I'm not glad, about the old arrangements. And now I've got the upper hand. - And what do you mean? - There's a murderer around here, and one thing's for sure it isn't me (chuckles). I wasn't here. Ever since you've kicked me out. I think you all agreed to get rid of him. And one of you killed him. Now you don't want the police to come sticking their noses in here. What with that boat of yours-- - You're a bad joke Frank! You haven't a shred of proof, except for that picture, and that doesn't show anything! - Why were you so scared of it then, eh? You did try to kill the girl didn't you? Would you call that proof? - No one tried to kill Julie. - Since I failed in crime, there's nothing for me to lose if I take that picture to the police. They'd welcome me with open arms. - Sure what can you expect from a cheap blackmailer? How much do you want Frank, how much? - 70%, and that isn't all. From now on I'm the one who's going to make the decisions. Just like old times. - What about Julie? (motor revving) - She'll be our guest here in my villa. - Uh-hmm... For how long? - As long as necessary. Then I'll decide what to do. - [Gerda] Who's gonna persuade her to keep her mouth shut? - I am. Maybe with a little help from your young friend. Watch it Gerda. Jealousy can give bad advice. You'll answer for Julie's safety. If anything happens to her, you know what to expect. This should hold me, for the time I'm away. - How long will that be? - I don't know yet, a week, maybe two. - Frank, I see you again? - Why sure, sure. That boy, Saro, he's still down at the villa. He'll probably go with Gerda, on our yacht. To Greece. So long! (perky jazz music) (water splashing) (tense music) (dramatic music) (tense jazz music) - Julie run up the path! Run Julie, run! (frenetic jazz music) - Louis! (scuffling) - Let me go, let me go! (grunting) - No, Louis! (dramatic music) Don't do it Louis! Come back, come back! (spear whooshing) Louis! (spear thumping) (grunting) (dramatic music) Louis... Louis! (tense music) Louis (sobs)! (tires screeching) (engine revving) (tense music) (door rumbling) - She's gone to the police, I saw her go in. Didn't get a chance to stop her! - What should we do Frank? Tell us what to do! - You'll have to get out of here, at once! There's no other way. - And what about you? - Me? I'll stay here, this is my place. I don't figure into the story. - What about Gerda? - She knows damn well she can't afford to have the police find her here now. They'll be here in less than an hour, so get on that yacht and get the hell out of here, all of you! There's no time to lose! And you take him with you! And look after Lucas's body. - So you get your villa back Frank. You're the master now. (metallic rattling) (engine revving) (dramatic music) - Lady Gerda? We've got to do it, you know that. Come on. - You go ahead, I'll be right up. (engine rumbling) Go ahead. (water splashing) (door rumbling) (lock clicking) (hinges creaking) (clicking) - Get up Julie, come with me. - You murderer, you did it! You killed Lucas! You and I are the only ones who know the truth, only we're not likely to tell anyone, are we? - So now you're gonna kill me? Go on, get it over with! - Oh, Julie, there's something better we can do, together. (chuckling) Come on Julie, I'll show you! - [Julie] I'm getting out of here! (knife whooshing) (knife thumping) Get out of my way! - It's useless Julie! (footsteps echoing) (door rumbling) (screaming) (Julie panting) (footsteps echoing) (hypnotic dramatic music) (dramatic music) (screaming) Yes, it was you Julie, you killed him. (sighing) He wasn't just your lover. - He was my doctor, the only man who could cure me. I had a terrible neurosis, caused by an obsession which was driving me to an asylum. He was my father, my god! He gave me my life back. He was the only man whoever succeeded in making me live. - And he suddenly walked out on you. You discovered where he was and you came looking for him. You met him before Gerda and the others realized you were here. - And I realized immediately what he really was. - What did he tell you when he first saw you? - He told me to go away. My savior, my idol, my father. He told me he didn't want me anymore (sobs)! He doesn't even care what happens to me! He wasn't interested, I was just a toy taken apart to see how it worked, put the pieces back together again. Now he was throwing me aside to look for another. I had to kill him. (knife thudding) (dramatic music) (cracking) (giggling) (squishing) (giggling) - While the others were lying, deaf and blind in the sun, you were busy cutting off Lucas's head. Then you ran away, without anyone seeing you. (Julie weeping) - The thing is I would... Something, what's wrong with me? And that's why I was under analysis with Lucas! - Ever since your father drove your mother out of the house when you were two years old, you had a compulsive urge to commit horrible, shameful, even atrocious actions. And every time you did this, a defensive mechanism, would wipe the whole thing from your memory. A, kind of censorship which came down like a curtain, to hide it from your consciousness. So by the time you'd gone back to Milano, the murder had been completely blocked out of your mind. - I had no idea I didn't miss Milan and what I'd done. When I set out to look for Lucas I really believed that he was alive, and knew absolutely nothing about what happened. - And you came back here as if it were the first time. When every trace of Lucas had disappeared. And later when the body was discovered, lying there all covered with blood, horrified and scared of the consequences, Gerda and her friends began suspecting and accusing one another. But a pact of complicity and fear kept them from talking. They couldn't allow the police to come poking their noses in, not with that yacht loaded with dope. - I suggest we better get rid of him. - I knew it was you who killed him, when I found those pants in your suitcase. They are the ones Saro painted in the picture. - So you kept piling up proof against me. - Yes, while that subconscious defense mechanism of yours kept trying to destroy it. You could always find some excuse for not going to the police. You kept trying to hide all the evidence, that could furnish the water-tight proof. You went so far as to strike a second time. - No, that's not true, don't say that! - Oh yes, it is. Julie, that boy, Saro, you killed him. You could have saved him, if you wanted to. You had no intention of taking him to the police. - Police? - Since I knew what happened, I used you to blackmail the others, to get them out of my house. That's why I protected you. I killed Antonio, remember? That man who took you to that deserted house in the village? To prevent him from killing you. He was the killer of the gang. Took his orders from Gerda. You should be grateful for that Julie. - Yes Frank I am. - You've always needed a man to possess you, to be your master, your father, Lucas. Now there's me. - Yes Frank, now there's you. (waves crashing) (Julie humming) (Julie gasping) - Can't you sing something else? Get me a cold beer. - Yes Frank, right away. ♪ Two little babies had (mumbles) ♪ ♪ Have it right in my party ♪ I'd surely (mumbles) everyone ♪ ♪ If you'd (mumbles) the night of purity ♪ - Come on, Julie! I'm dying of thirst! (eerie suspenseful music) (Frank gasping) (squishing) (thumping) (siren wailing) (knife thumping) (sirens wailing) (enigmatic jazz music)
