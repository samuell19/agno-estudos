=Gong Ah Jeong, you have been dismissed.= =I'm really sorry. Then... I'm hanging up now.= What was that call about? Gi Jun, I'm sorry. I have to leave first. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Ah Jeong! Gong Ah Jeong! Ah Jeong! What's wrong? It's nothing. What is the matter? If nothing were wrong, would you run out without shoes? What happened exactly? Tell me quickly! I'm suddenly not feeling well... Ah Jeong! There's really nothing wrong. Go back inside, okay? You didn't even greet anyone and you came out here. Go back and explain to Chairman Chen and his wife what just happened. What exactly is the matter? You suddenly received a phone call... What was the phone call about? It's not because of the phone call. Then is it because of that reporter? Is it because of that? Ah Jeong! I'm useless, okay? I'll carry you. I said I'll carry you! You're barefoot, aren't you? This is the first time I am carrying you. Yes, that's right. Are you happy? You're heavier than I imagined. I'm sorry. What? Because I'm heavy and you have to carry me. Just kidding. You're not heavy at all. Liar. Really, I wish I could carry you like this everyday. -= Episode 15 =- Excuse me! Thank you. Cheer up! Even though I don't know what has upset you... Thank you. What are you afraid of? This isn't a glass slipper. Give it to me. I'll put it on myself. I'll do it. Cry baby. Don't cry. I don't want to see you cry. Alright. I won't let you cry again. Alright. I will make you laugh everyday. Then, I will ask you a question. How do you feel about turning into Cinderella suddenly? Are you in a romantic relationship with President Hyeon Gi Jun? I, Hyeon Gi Jun, sincerely love Gong Ah Jeong! =Miss Gong Ah Jeong, you have been dismissed.= What? You've really been dismissed? Yes. Really...! How can it like this? Where can they find such a careful and honest civil servant officer like you? Because you two are in a relationship, is that why it has ended up this way? If the other person were a stranger, would the decision be like this? Sunbae, help me keep this matter a secret. Will you help me with something? (Sunbae - senior, mentor) What do you want to do? I want to get my job back. Even if I were to leave, I cannot just allow the matter to rest like this. I must protect both of our reputations. Actually, we can prepare a detailed evidence log and submit it to the Appeals Committee. Evidence? This can't work. You have already been dismissed from your post. It's not also easy to find evidence. Furthermore, the decision has been made. It's going to be hard to prove your innocence. I know... that unexpected things might also happen. Even if it's like this, you still want to try? Mmm... That, Professor Gong you're really quite something. What? No, it should be your daughter. Oh, let's not talk about that. Frankly speaking, she can't be dismissed. Why is that? When are you going to stop getting in trouble with Gong Ah Jeong? -=Hyeon Gi Jun's woman, Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong, dismissed=- What exactly are you going to do about this? Gi Jun, I'm sorry I have to leave first. Do you know how to write reports? Why did they say Gong Ah Jeong gave Gold Resort special treatment? Because she's your girlfriend. This makes me mad. Okay! Love is like what you say, private and free. But, must you create an uproar? Didn't you even consider my position in the company? I'm sorry. Gi Jun! Right now! Contact anyone in the Ministry of Culture immediately. What? No, contact the minister's office. Quickly! Okay, I got it. =Hyeon Gun= Ah Jeong! Mmm... I saw the news. It's already on the news? Yes. Recently, my daughter is getting more attention than the top celebrities! Dad. Dad, do you believe me? Of course! Do you know why you were named Gong Ah Jeong? So you can become South Korea's most positive and fair citizen. So you were named Gong Ah Jeong. Do you understand? The Gong Ah Jeong that I know will absolutely not do anything to tarnish her reputation like that. Even if everyone else gives in, you would still stick to your principles. Even if someone give you ten dollars more, you will not accept it. Dad. I am innocent... so I want to fight this battle. Good, good. Good thinking. You'll do well. Also, they don't know whose daughter you are! Exactly. Wow, you're really persistent! You weren't jealous because I had a date with her for a while, right? Although I'm very jealous, today I will endure. What? Fine then, I will excuse you for a moment. Finish it quickly. Just for a little while! Father-in-law, thank you! Have you eaten? How come you're always worried whether I have already eaten or not? I'm not a pig. It's a relief you're so strong. You don't have to worry about anything. I will resolve everything for you. No, I'll resolve my own matters. Between the two of us, whatever affects you, affects me. Even if some people are not fair, God is. The truth will eventually come out, so don't worry. Although it would not be simple, we will fight them together, okay? Do you understand? Okay. Stubborn little thing. I've heard not long ago that the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, wants to go to our Gold Resort to gather information. Did the disciplinary committee members mention anything? They may have misunderstood. They think I chose Gold Resort for a special reason. I knew that it would be like this. Because of me. With this matter, I didn't help you and I also knocked you down. With you helping me in the future is enough. What if I can't? Can you still escape? Even if I try to escape, I will reinstate my reputation before I run away. Do you dare to escape? I will kidnap you in advance. Kidnapping. Affairs Officer. This is the information that you wanted, plus some more that I added. Thank you! Affairs Officer, be strong. Fighting! I prepared these. Take a look. Sunbae, look. This is World Hotel's ratings. It's much higher! I see these are also... right. Really? Petition. Here. We can't just simply sit by and watch what happens. For the reinstatement of Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong, let's have a signature campaign for it. It should be able to help a little. Let's list down how Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong, is usually fair and honest in her work. Write them out in detail. The Minister said that after the foreign matters have been settled, he would return only next month probably. I reviewed the related documents, but I think they are useless. Useless? Why? Instead of saying that the problem lies with the information, I would rather say that the problem lies with this issue. If we can prove that President and Miss Gong Ah Jeong are not in a romantic relationship, this thing can be resolved. But Miss Gong Ah Jeong... insisted that she is in a relationship with you. So... But, there must be a way, right? Yes. I don't care what methods you use. Just find it. I don't care how much it costs. If there is something that I can do, find a way. Yes, I know. Hello. Sorry to trouble you, could you... Thank you! Hello, could you take a look for just a moment? -=The Affairs Officer of Ministry of Tourism, Gong Ah Jeong is an honest person. The truth will prevail eventually!=- - Hello. Please have a look at this. -=The Affairs Officer of Ministry of Tourism, Gong Ah Jeong is an honest person. The truth will prevail eventually!=- - This matter is regarding Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong. -=Can't public servants of Republic of South Korea be in love? Don't distort the truth!=- - This matter is regarding Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong. Hello. Hello, please have a look. Hello, please have a look. This is regarding Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong. Please have a look. Please have a look. Thank you. What are you doing now? This is my first time doing such a thing, but it's really meaningful. Didn't I tell you not to do anything? I'll take care of it myself. What are these for? Take a look. -=Protest the dismissal of "Gong Ah Jeong"! Support her reinstatement!=- - The wordings are convincing and straightforward. Not bad, right? I asked Park Hoon for some ideas, but he ended up with old-fashioned words, as always. These all are edited by me. Gi Jun. It's alright. This is so embarrassing, but why are you still doing it personally? It's for a personal cause, of course, I have to handle it personally. In this world there are matters which can be settled with money, and those which cannot be. Moreover, there are many other famous personalities who also hold cards and demonstrate, too. So, there's nothing to be ashamed of. You've really done a great thing. Despite having done this, if you still don't get reinstated, I'll carry out a "Save Gong Ah Jeong" mass demonstration in front of the entrance of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. It seems like you aren't very busy? You don't seem to be aware of my ability. I manage things relatively fast. Otherwise, how could I be sitting in this position at my age? I'm really envious of you for that ability. Ah... moreover, even if you're jobless, it doesn't matter. I'm Hyeon Gi Jun, President of World Hotel. You only need to do some flower arrangement, yoga, shopping... Don't you know how many people want this kind of lifestyle? You'll simply become the envy of all women. I'm definitely not like that! I can't spend my life just arranging flowers, doing yoga and going shopping. When did you start to be so passionate about your work? Wasn't it since you didn't have much choice back then that you took up this job? Ah... now, you have really hurt my pride. I thought you said, you took the civil exams because of your senior, wasn't it? Hey, what are...! I don't have dreams and also don't have goals in life. Because of my first love, I blindly went to sit for the civil examination. Then, I was lucky enough to pass. I always carried out irrelevant duties, up to now... Then why are we carrying out this reinstatement protest? We should just keep quiet and let my career dies. Anyway, the photograph that I'd chosen, it's nice, right? Yun Ju. What is it? What else could it be? Knowing that you aren't eating well... I'm worried. So, I've bought something for you to eat. Why are you reading all these stuffs? You really... I'm alright, mom. Nothing's wrong. There's nothing wrong. Quickly, eat some rice, alright? Mom... Okay... say it out loud. Don't keep it to yourself. It's so nice... being in your embrace. There's nothing wrong with you. It's not your fault that things have turned out to this way. I know. I also know that oppa won't come back to me. (Oppa - older brother, boyfriend) Mom. Okay. Therefore Mother, you should just back out of this situation like your daughter Yun Ju. I... I was wrong. I did something bad at the end. What do you mean? I just feel that I have become worse and worse. Yun Ju. Living here will cause you a great deal of pain. Why don't you start all over again in France? You're going to have nosebleed. Seeing you like this, people will think you're preparing for an exam. You go to bed first. If you put this much effort into your job, you'll be getting double whatever you're earning right now. You've done so much for Ah Jeong. What more is needed to be done? I need to protect my client's confidentiality. Client's confidentiality? Alright... if you fail in Ah Jeong's reinstatement... I'll just... What will you do? Hey, So Ran! Don't even think about touching me for a year. Oh, honey. Hey, So Ran. Wait for me. I'm coming. Wait! So Ran! So Ran! I'm Gong Ah Jeong, from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism Publicity Division. This is the investigation result from the Central Public Officer Training Institute. I am... I am... I am... the public affairs officer. Don't cry. Don't cry. Please go to the third floor. Third floor? - Yes. - Thank you. Today, we will decide on the appeal case of reinstatement of Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong. Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong, are you prepared for the final debate? Yes. Please tell us your conclusions. Prior to that, I wish to bring forward some information. What is this? Anyway, you still need to tell us your conclusions. The document that I have just submitted is the investigation result from the Central Public Officer Training Institute. The content is similar to the document I used in evaluating Gold Resort. This is the result for the evaluation of two final resorts. Out of 100 people, 98 chose Gold Resort. Did you personally investigate and let them do it? Yes, I personally apologized to them before proceeding with the survey. Then, I received their signatures as acknowledgment. If I were being biased, and blindly chose Gold Resort, I'm willing to accept any punishment. As you could see from the results, the vast majority of the people drew the same conclusions as mine. Because of a personal relationship, I can understand why everybody was suspicious of me. But that's not enough to punish me like this without an investigation. I can't accept that. If you really want to punish me, everyone will have more concerns and worries in the future, and may not make the choice that is just and fair. Then, that way, it will be against the principles of public officials that should be complied. I can state again that I was fair and just in my choice during the selection process. Even if given a second opportunity, my choice would remain unchanged. This is because if someone is really honest on carrying out one's duty, love will not become a problem. This is my conclusion. According to your statements just now, and those survey results that you've submitted, we will draw a final conclusion on your matter. How is it? It's alright. Gi Jun. In the future, I can't join you for morning exercise anymore. Ah Jeong... I can start working again. You succeeded? You got reinstated? Ah Jeong! Is it true? You really got reinstated? Gong Ah Jeong is not guilty! Why are you crying when this should be a matter of fact? I'm too happy! Congratulations! - Cheers! - Cheers! Dad! Dad! Dad! Let's drink like this... That's great! That's gross! When will you start working? Next week. Then, why don't you go away for a vacation first? With you? Then, you want to go with that guy? Yes. You are so mean. You won't be able to see me if you want to, even after you're married. I only have one daughter, yet I'm being treated this way. What marriage? I'm living with dad. You want me to believe that? It's true, I don't want to get married. Really? Yes, right. No matter what, you are able to make major decisions on your own without my help, You have truly grown up! Physically, I'm taller than dad. Aigoo, Is it? Even without a mother, you still grew up nicely. (Aigoo - oh dear, oh my God) I'm really grateful to you! Dad, let's have another glass. I heard about Gong Ah Jeong's reinstatement. Holding an individual demonstration in front of the Ministry's office? You've heard. What's wrong with you actually? Do you really want to marry her? Yes. If I could, I want to marry her immediately. What is so good about her? She's only an ordinary public officer with a plain family background. She is ordinary. That's why I like her. Looks like you won't listen to whatever I say. You really want to oppose? You know it won't work, right? Dad, my hand phone? Hand phone! Oh, right! Public officer pass! I'm leaving. Eat first before you go. Sit down and eat. What's that? I forgot. Thank you! It's delicious! Eat slowly. In that case, I'm off to work. Finish eating before you go! What is that? Are there any activities? It's so cute. What are you doing? What is this? Congratulations! Congratulations! Gong Ah Jeong, congratulations on your reinstatement. Today, I'll treat everyone with ice cream. Welcome back! We submitted a petition as well. We also contributed something, you know? I knew that you would come back. Both of you will get married, right? When are you getting married? You need to invite us! What marriage? Not yet. What nothing? - Get married! Get married! - Get married! Get married! You're almost done. So, just take it off, okay? You let me do just anything. Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jeong, congratulations to you. - Get married! Get married! - Get married! Get married! I'm about to die of embarrassment. You hate it? Yes. Really, you hate it? Yes. You seriously hate it? Yes. You completely hate it? No, I don't. I like it. I really like it. I know you like it. Can't you be honest? Public Officers are always honest. How can you compare that kind of honesty and this? Wait. This time you need to answer me truthfully. What is it? Just now when other people ask you, what is wrong with you? What's wrong? You don't plan to marry me? Well, it's just... What? You're really thinking like that? It's so hot. Looks like summer is really here. What is this? You're really not sincere with me? Please... I have to go back. I deliberately came over early. I don't want to be late on the first day. You can't. Finish what you're saying first before you go. Later. I will say it later. Finish it before you go! Gong Ah Jeong! You don't plan to marry me? Well, it's just... What? You really think like that? Why did you leave the door open? Wow, I thought I entered a wrong place. What's the matter that you're arranging your room? That's right. It's the first time you see me cleaning, right? That's right. Cleaning it like this, it surely looks clean. Your workplace should be handled more efficiently. But other than the workplace, did your face get better? Looks refreshing and bright. Really? That's great! It's nothing. Did something happen? I'm planning to return to Paris. What? Up till now, are you still uncomfortable? No, it is not that I am running away because I am uncomfortable. I don't want to live this way. I plan to let go of the hand that is grabbing hold of oppa. I'll go back to rest for a while, and then continue with my studies. Okay, that's very good. Furthermore, I will find a better man and live happily. That's good. But if you meet someone better, I may become jealous. Miss Yun Ju. I heard that you were reinstated. Yes, there was a misunderstanding. Miss Ah Jeong, I'm sorry. I know that you are a good person. But I've always hated you. In fact I shouldn't have hated you. No, it's okay. Even if it was me, I would also have hated you. As I told you before, I can understand your feelings. Thanks for understanding me. And also, you can hate me. Hating me is the normal thing to do. You can hate me for this. No need to feel sorry for me. But, I hope you will just hate me. Looks like I lost. Why do you say that? There's no win or lose here. I am returning to Paris tomorrow. This is the world's most delicious Italian pasta? Try it, then, you will know. After you taste it, don't faint! When did you learn to do this? Didn't you say you were so busy? These days, you can't just depend on a career alone. Sports, art, music... you must be good in all aspects. Only then you can be regarded as a real businessman. Looks like you are from a good and wealthy family! Didn't you know? Did you just approach me without knowledge of my circumstances? Approach? Who approached you? Honey, I'm here. When did I say that? Why are you being shy, now that there aren't too many days left before you call me honey? What are you saying...? Come on. How is it? What? You've fainted? Do you want me to call 119? Delicious! You wait a while. Hand me the cell phone. Ah... very hot! Oppa, I'm going back to Paris tomorrow. Before I leave, I want to meet you. If you can come, please call me. Tomorrow, Miss Yun Ju will be leaving. Why don't you go see her? I really mean it. It's better like this, even for me. Do you understand? Please sit. Thank you for coming over. I am leaving. I want to let you go. I just wanted to tell you this. After this, what are your plans? You have to start over and live well. I also have my own precious life. Looks like you really have accepted everything now. Although it's very painful, you already told me what I should do. It's my turn to make the decision. Although I've already accepted it, I haven't acknowledged it yet. Yun Ju. The times I spent with you are precious memories to me. I want to thank you. This is true, and it will not change. Thank you. Thank you too. You scared me. What are you doing here? Here, take this. What is this? It's a present. Something that is difficult to find in Paris. What is it? Can I take a look? If you open it now, it's going to smell. It's pepper paste, actually! My brother told me to get it for you. It's gochujang. (Gochujang - A Korean traditional fermented hot pepper paste). He said it's your favorite. He made it overnight yesterday. He said if you want to say thank you, you just tell me. Thank you very much. I'll tell him that. Sang Hi, I must thank you, too. Me? I haven't done anything that you need to be grateful for. No, thanks to you, I can quickly let go of everything. Then, you must give me a gift. In the future, okay? When I hold an exhibit in Paris, I will contact you. Okay. If I am to hold an exhibit, I'll contact you too. When that time comes, most probably you'll be accompanied by a blonde male movie star, appearing in front of me? Live well. Seeing you smile before leaving, I am now at ease. Okay. I'm going. =Passengers, please note that flight 0123 to Paris= =is ready to take off.= =Please proceed to boarding gate No. 23.= =Passengers please note...= You surprised me. Why did you suddenly ask me to come over? Just wait, there is a place you need to go with me. Where? When the time comes, you'll know. Keep smiling. Where? So pretty. Lips. Lips. Where? You will know. Where exactly? Wow, so beautiful! Look at the mirror. What do you think? I naturally look younger than my age. - Isn't it? - Your skin is very smooth. Why aren't you answering me? Let's do the hair, okay? The hair. Where exactly are we going? Father-in-law, how about this? What are you doing? Is it too dark? Wait a moment. This man, really... How about this? What is this all about actually? It's Ah Jeong's reinstatement celebration. What kind of celebration do you plan on having? You know she has gone through a rough time, right? I thought of everything I can to help her. I found it. How about this? I'm not used to wearing these kinds of clothes. Father-in-law, please try them on first. - This guy. - Quickly, quickly. Are you crying? It is hot, you little fellow. You are crying. Who's crying? Don't cry. It's not a funeral. Today, I have really lived. I didn't expect that I'll do such a thing for someone who's leaving. I'm sorry. Hyeong, the time has come. (Hyeong - older brother) I've got to go. Pack this! Don't cry! I know already, you little fellow. How come it's so hot? How long do we need to stay like this? Just turn on the lights, okay? Just wait a minute. Why aren't you here yet? I'm starving to death already. This is just frustrating. Isn't this a celebration on Ah Jeong's reinstatement? Is it here? Father-in-law, wait a minute. Please watch your step. Why is it so dark? Okay, it's all set. What's happening? It's Ah Jeong's celebration. What are you doing? Professor Gong, on what occasion are you back from? One, two, three! Congratulations! Go stand together. Isn't this to celebrate Ah Jeong's reinstatement? I'm sorry. You dare tease the elderly? Shouldn't you be grateful? Be seated, okay? Sit. Come, sit down. Here's the cake, a three-tiered cake. Dad, the cake is pretty, isn't it? We baked it together. You plan to get rid of me and run quickly to this man, huh? My dad's really able to make good judgments. Speak truthfully. When are you planning to get married? The whole world knows already. From a woman's viewpoint, an early marriage is better. Please don't worry. I will strike immediately. Who said so? Let's take a picture! Sang Hi! Take a picture. Okay, okay. Please look at the camera. Wait for the others. Come, give it to me. I should be the one taking the photos. You're part of the family. Congratulations, both of you! I can just cook for you. Please enjoy it. Ready? Look here. Okay, ready? One! Two! Wow, it's so nice. Let's eat! What is this? Do we have to write a contract again? Of course, it's possible. What is it? The things that Gong Ah Jeong wants her ideal man to be... List down 10 of them. What? And for me, the things that I want from my woman... I'll list down 10 of them. Why? Sometimes I think we don't know each other that well. You should at least try to adjust. Should I be able to write at least ten? Do you have the confidence to comply with all these? Of course. There's nothing I can't do. Did you forget Hyeon Gi Jun's five elements package? Of course, I remember. Handsome, educated, well-mannered, knowledgeable, and responsible. I feel like I've been completely brainwashed. So, you don't have to worry about me. Just worry about yourself. If there is a woman like me, let her come out. Let's just try to write it out, okay? We finished at the same time. Let's exchange lists. I want to see it first. Give it to me! Let me see yours first. I'll take a look at it. Of the 10 criteria, if you could fulfill 5 of them, I will still regard you as my perfect man. For me? If you can satisfy only 3 of them, I will still carry you everyday. Then, show it to me. What do you want? What? First, even if it's just cereal, a woman should cook breakfast for me. Second, a woman who can exercise with me in the morning. Third, a woman who says sorry after a fight and be able to accept my apologies. Fourth, a woman who cries a lot after watching sad movies. Fifth, a woman who will spend time with me even though our interests differ. Sixth, a woman who doesn't tell even a little lie, an honest woman. Anybody here? Hyeon Sang Hi! Where did he go? He cleans up very neatly. These are all Sang Hi's painting? I think I've seen this person. Who is it? Seems like someone I know. Who is it? Someone has come to my mind. It's you. I'm sorry. What is the matter? Why are you here? I just brought some food here. Why are you doing this? Trying to act like a sister-in-law now? Yes. That's it. Take some. Not denying it. Okay, I will eat. But, who is it in this painting? It's you. Me? Why did you paint me? Nothing. I wanted to find a face with personality, so I just painted this. Why? Why can't you speak more pleasantly? Since this is painted so well, it should be displayed openly. Why put it aside in the corner? It originally hung there, but that ugly face was always looking at me, so, I just took it down. Just give this to me as a gift, okay? What have you been painting recently? It's still an idea. That's right. If you have a photo of you and my brother, give me one. What for? So that you can draw us? You both look good together. Although you're ugly, but this time, I'll make you prettier. Really...! I will be patient. Let's eat. Cereals are good, too. Let him make breakfast. Exercise a bit. Your apologies can be accepted. I can still laugh about this and cry. But this one is not quite satisfying! After years go by, people will get older. Women who will not have wrinkles even without using anti-wrinkle treatments. Where can he find a woman like that? Ah, Really! Too greedy! Stop dreaming, President Hyeon. Good night. You've come? Sit down. Wait a minute. It's me. The additional costs for the Jeju construction site must be resolved today. Allocate 200 billion Won to settle this. Okay, I understand. I have called you down, but yet I am always like this. But this is work, I can't help it. It's alright. Are you feeling uncomfortable? Just relax and take a seat. No, I am very comfortable. Take a look at this. If you want to help Gi Jun and stay by his side, then, you should take a look at this. Within a year, the conferences organized by the various national embassies will number around ten. So, you have to learn 5 to 6 languages. Even if it is a little difficult, you have to learn them. If you want to become Gi Jun's wife, you cannot just put on a smile all the time. Yes, and also golf, horseback riding... can you do it? What? You do not have to be good at them. These won't be much of a problem since you can slowly pick them up. You are aware that our Gi Jun frequently travels overseas for work, right? Yes, I know. Gi Jun has always traveled alone all this time. In the future, if you are able accompany him, Gi Jun's burden can also be greatly reduced. You have seen Chairman Chen and his wife, right? Since you have experienced it, you should also know. During that time, you have helped Gi Jun a great deal. It's not like that. Actually I didn't do much at all. But Chairman. I want to keep my own work. Work? Your work at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, right? You can continue your job for now. It wasn't easy for you to get reinstated. It would not be appropriate to resign so suddenly. No. Even if I am seeing Gi Jun... or if I get married with Gi Jun in the future, I have no intention of giving up my job. Is that so? Very well. Wanting to continue working is a good thing. But Ah Jeong, if you can help Gi Jun, it would be better. Of course, this is all up to you. You do what you see fit. Yes. Hello. I am from Lady Power, reporter Shin Hye-seon. Nice to meet you, Hye-seon. Please have a seat. Fine. Coming to you during working hours, you don't have much time, right? No. It's alright. Then, will it be okay to ask you a few brief questions? You're more beautiful in person! It's not like that. Thank you. When are you getting married? What? Married? Although your relationship has already been made public, did you get the marriage proposal in private? How did Hyeon Gi Jun propose? Our readers are most curious about this. We have yet to reach that stage. There is no wedding plan at the moment? I took it for granted that the marriage discussion is on-going. Don't tell me, you've broken up? We didn't break up. So, the relationship has yet to reach the marriage stage? That... Then, could it be that you've yet to receive a marriage proposal? Right? Yes. Then, I have another question. If you are getting married, you will joining World Group's family. Your priority should be becoming President Hyeon Gi Jun's wife first, right? Able to accept an apology. X. This is also... X. X. X. Number 10... is very clear about the kind of woman Hyeon Gi Jun likes. X. X. X. Within a year, the conferences organized by the various national embassies will number around ten. So, you have to learn 5 to 6 languages. Even if it is a little difficult, you have to learn them. Yes, and also golf, horseback riding, can you do it? How about a place like this? There is even a lake in the estate. It should be able to plant a hundred pine trees. No matter how I look at it, having water features like a lake would be better. Wait a minute. Look at this. I'm also very satisfied with this design. Firstly, the interior is unique. Take a look. The ceiling is very high, it's not bad. Wait a moment, let's take a look at this too. Look, this is a highlight right? What? Not satisfied with all of them? No, all of them are pretty good. But? Have you read mine? Huh? Ah... Ideal type? Of course, I have even memorized it. Since you memorized it, you still do this? What? A man who is able to put himself in the other person's shoe, considers the problem, and understands the state and emotion of the other person. Ah... your mood is not very good today. Did something happen in the company? Nothing. What do you mean by nothing? Well, I would like you to just relax today. I've prepared something which happens to be useful now. Let's go. Come, watch your step. Ah, Feet? Feet? Don't peek. Okay, I know. What? Here we are. Are we there yet? One, two, three! What are these? I do have some artistic soul. Sang Hi, too. We have agreed that this is off limits to non-family members. No. All of these, did you do it by yourself? These... all of these? These... all of these are yours. There is a name engraved on this sculpture. Gong - Ah - Jeong! All these... are they all there is? These little things aren't enough to make me feel better. Of course, there's more. Secret room. Secret room? This room has never been shown to anyone before. My very own personal space. There's still such a place? A special opening only for Gong Ah Jeong! Miniature models! It's really beautiful. How did you do these? Wait, did you do all these by yourself? Of course, all these were done by me. Wait, when did you have the time to do these by yourself? You're such a busy man. Although our interests are different, we can still share it with each other. True. So cute! So pretty! Today's highlight... It's a train! To a person who has always lived for other people, a place like this is already considered a gift. From today onwards, I want to share this with you. Will you... marry me? Gi Jun. I've also considered a lot of things about marriage. I... don't seem fit to be your woman. -= Next Episode Preview =- I love you. I love you so much that I'm afraid if I would able to live in a world without you. I'm fine with it, but will that guy agree? Do you really plan on calling him "that guy" "that guy"?
