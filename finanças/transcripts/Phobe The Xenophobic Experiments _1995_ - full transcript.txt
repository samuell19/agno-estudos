(rocket launcher whooshing) (dramatic music) Yo, can you give me a hand here, man? Yo, Sandman, I got another one for you, that's if you can squeeze him between those donuts of yours. - Yeah right, Drip. I mean, Dapp. Hey listen, you still with that fox you picked up last week? - Nah, she split, man. Packed her bags and left. - Oh, that's too bad. - Yeah. - She was hot. Hey listen, can you give me her number? - [Greg] No. - All right, well, I'll book these guys for you. - Thanks, my man, appreciate it. (inmate mumbling) (eerie music) (computer blaring) Yes sir, what's up? - Well, we've got another problem down here and it's very serious. - So what is it this time? - A phobe has escaped during the termination... (button clacks) (computer blaring) Dapp, I know you don't wanna hear this, but you're the only one left that can do the job. - So what happened? - The phobe has stolen a ship and flown directly into an astroid field. We need you down here right away. - All right, I'll be there. - Thanks Greg, I owe you one. - Yeah, I've heard that before. You owe me a lot. One day, I might even be around to collect. (intense music) (foreboding music) (computers beeping) - Greg, you're here. Nice to see you again, sergeant. - Yeah, I'm sure you are. So what's the problem now? - It's a phobe. You see, recently we've been transporting them off their planet to be safely terminated. However, during this process one of them has managed to escape. Stolen one of our ships and flown directly into an astroid field in sector 1084. - You mean you called me all the way here just to tell me that? Why can't you get one of your men out and destroy it? You said they're being terminated. - I'm afraid we tried that already, Greg. I failed. I've lost a few good men. Even more men were lost in that astroid field. - Something in your story just doesn't click. You mean to tell me that one ship can outfight a whole squadron without even getting hit? - Yes, you're right. This phobe that escaped has somehow managed to reactivate its reproductive system and therefore must be brought back alive to be examined by our scientists. They'd like to know how its managed to do this. This way, we can stop the remaining phobes from doing the same thing until they're all safely terminated. - So what you're saying is you want this thing brought back alive? Are you nuts? You know what they can do, you've seen it yourself. I don't know why you just didn't blow up that planet long ago, then none of this would've ever happened. - I know what you're saying but you're just gonna have to trust me on this one. So can I count on you to do the job or what? - Okay, I'll do it one last time, on two conditions. One, you play by my rules. Two, I want your word, after I'm done, these things will all be terminated. - You've got my word. - [Agent] Sir, the phobe has just left the astroid field and jumped into hyper travel. - Can you still continue to track it? - Yes, but not for much longer. (tense music) (computers beeping) (exciting music) (aircraft humming) - [Greg] 8984 request permission for liftoff, over. - [Control Announcer] Eight, niner, eight, four. You're clear for departure at runway 242 left, over.

Command out. - [Greg] Setting up hyperspace interval. Guess I'll see you in hell. (aircraft whooshing) (ominous music) - It's done. Dapp is on his way. He's going after the phobe. - I trust you stressed the importance of bringing that thing back alive. It's of no value to me dead. - Yes, Dapp was the right man for the job. In fact, he enjoys the challenge of trying to capture this thing alive rather than just killing it. He's done this before. - I hope so, for your sake. If the phobe is harmed, your employment here will be terminated as will you, Commander. - [Commander] I have faith in you, Dapp. Don't let me down. (exciting music) (insects chirping) (aircraft whooshing) - Hey, Jerry, come here, check this out. (tense music) - What the heck is that thing? Hurry up, get the flashlights. Come on, we'll go check it out. Hurry up. (foreboding music) - [Tim] Come on, Jer, I don't think this is a good idea right now. Maybe we should come back tomorrow when there's more light. - What's the matter, Tim, you scared? - Not scared, much. - Ah, don't worry about it. You're just frightened 'cause of that horror movie we just finished watching. Probably nothing out here anyway. - [Tim] Probably? What do you mean, probably? - Chill out, man. Had to get outta the house and get some fresh air anyhow. You're the one that saw the stupid meteorite land in the forest. (eerie music) (insects chirping) (phobe growling) (scanner beeping) - Jer? Jer, is that you? Where the hell are you? Come on man, this isn't funny. (eerie music) (phobe growling) Jerry, where are you man? Jerry, come on. This isn't funny anymore.

(suspenseful music) What the hell is this thing? - Jer? (Jerry screams) - Woo! Don't scare me like that. - Sorry.

I thought that's what your job was. Why do you keep calling him an it? - Well, because... - Why don't you just go up and shoot him? He did kill Tim and God knows who else. - My first priority is to capture it, but that's not important right now. The phobe must have came here while I was tracking it. Did you find anything unusual today? - Phobe? What's a phobe? Is that what you cops call psychos? - Well, it's not exactly a psycho as you would call it. - Well, what is it then? - How would you say? It's an alien life form. - An alien life form? Are you feeling okay? Maybe you should've seen the doctor. - Did you find anything unusual today? - Yeah, you. Well, come to think of it, I did find an odd-looking rock. If that's what you mean. - You did? Where is it? - Is this what you're talking about? - That's it, you found a phobe's egg. This makes my job easier. They didn't say nothing about destroying the egg. - [Jennifer] An egg? What the hell are you smoking? What kind of an egg? - The phobe's egg. - Well, suppose you are telling the truth, why don't you just smash the egg? I'm sure this planet doesn't need another phobe running around. - It's not quite that simple. See, the egg has to be destroyed by the defertilization module. Anything else just speeds up the incubation process. In that case, we'd have more phobes than we'd know what to do with. - Well, can you destroy this one? - [Greg] Yes, I think we still have time left. - Time left? How much time do you have? - In most cases, 72 hours after being laid. (ominous music) Quickly, get dressed. We must leave here, it's no longer safe. - Well, tell me where this so-called alien came from. How did he get here?

I'll explain later, but right now we gotta get somewhere safe. - We could go back to my place. - That's not a good idea.

Or should I say, what are you? - I'll explain later, okay? Right now what I need is a radio. - Radio, why don't you just use the phone? - 'Cause there aren't any phones there. - I know where there's a radio. My friend, Rob's house. His dad has one at his work. His parents are away for the weekend, so he can get into the building really easily. - [Greg] Let's go. (suspenseful music) - Come on, this way. - This Rob's house? - Yeah, he should be home. He never goes out on a Friday night.

Sure, but why? - It's a long story. - Well, hold on, I'll go get the keys to my father's office. Say, didn't you go to that party? - No, it's too dangerous out there. We gotta get rid of that thing first. - Hold on, I'll go get the keys. Okay, let's go. - Oh, by the way, Rob, this is Sergeant Dapp. - Hi, how you doing? - Hi, Sergeant. - Come on, we better get going. - Jen, you in some kind of trouble? - We're all in trouble. Come on. (ominous music) - [Rob] So what happened to you? - I was on my way home from school earlier today and some creature attacked me. That's how I met Sergeant Dapp. He saved my life. - No way, that can't be true. This is like a joke or something. - Oh, it's no joke. Say, Rob, is this the radio that you were talking about? - Yeah, yeah, that's the radio. - Well, it's a little bit on the primitive side but I think this should do the trick. - Okay, Dapp, now we're in a safe place. So tell me who you are or what you are. - Please, Jennifer, call me Greg, will you? - All right, Greg, talk. - What is this? I've never seen a gun like this before. What's it called? - [Greg] It's called the BF-6000 Pulse Pistol, Rob. What I did was took the energy cell of it to power up the radio, therefore increasing the signal. But in essence, the weapon is now nonfunctional. (radio buzzing) - Born 2381 C, Planet Mondora? System 2720? Test tube number 166-2380. Occupation classified? License to terminate? Space number 266-3822? So, you're not human? (radio humming) - [Rob] So is anybody thirsty? - Yes, I could use something to drink. - [Greg] Well sure, yeah sure, why not? - Let's go to the lunch room and see what we can find. (phobe panting) (eerie music) So you're from the future? - No, I'm not from the future. I'm from a small world, much like your own. We call it Mondora. I ended up here while tracking that creature you saw, Jen. Beside our planet is a smaller world. Actually, it's pretty desolate, where one could barely just survive. There, a fierce race lives in exile. These creatures were created as the ultimate fighting soldier to defend us in the Trihunal War. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the war ended. The problem then became what to do with the creature that knows only to kill, period. That's why we sent them into exile on the other planet. Soon they were forgotten about until a few months ago, when they started popping up in other regions, including Mondora. Problem was then, were they just escaping or did someone take them off the plant? (phobe panting) My theory is the phobes are being sold on the black market. But of course, I can't prove any of this. So a special task force was set up to try to stop the phobes and anybody involved with them. One by one, we hunted them down. Been trying to find some evidence to back my story. I gave up, finally, about a month ago when I realized I was the only member left on the team. I left a lotta good friends, especially one in particular. - Was this person special to you? - Yes, she was. - I'm sorry. - [Greg] Thanks. - [Rob] So what are these creatures called anyway? - They're known as phobes, which stands for the Xenophobic Experiments. Xenophobic means fear of aliens. This is what he hoped for when we first created 'em, but little did we know it would come back on us. - So what's the radio for? - Well that's just so I can call for some backup, so I can phone my world. That way, once I catch the phobe, I can leave this planet and hopefully your world will be safe forever. - By the way, why do you where those glasses even when we're inside? Are your eyes sensitive to light or something? - No, my eyes aren't sensitive to light, it's just that the ultraviolet rays here are more intense than on my planet. Thus, it causes a chemical reaction and then my eyes, well, they glow yellow. - Glow, really? Can we see? - Yeah, okay. (eerie music) - Cool. (phobe panting) (object clattering) Oh my god, what was that? Tell me it's not that creature again. - Say, Rob, does anybody come here late at night? Like cleaning staff? - Not that I know of. - Okay, you stay here, I'll go check it out. Stay with Jennifer. - Okay. (ominous music) (phobe panting) (phobe panting) (device buzzing) (glass shattering) (Jennifer screaming) - Quickly, we've gotta, what happened? Are you okay, where's Jennifer? - That thing has got her. It appeared from nowhere. We better go after it and get Jennifer. - No, you wait here, which direction they go in? - That way. - You wait here. I'll be right back. - Okay. (intense music) (weapon blasting) - Oh, Dapp, what are you doing? You coulda had Jennifer. (foreboding music) (Rob groaning) Try not to move. Try not to move too much. - [Rob] Don't worry about me. Go on and get Jennifer, I'll be fine. - Sure you'll be okay? - Yeah. (groans) - Don't worry, I'll find her. - How? You don't even know where Jennifer is. - Remember that pendent I gave her before? It works as a tracer. (suspenseful music) (wind howling) (device buzzing) (tense music) (device buzzing) (suspenseful music) (device buzzing) Jennifer, Jennifer, are you okay? Jennifer? Come on, we gotta get going. (mumbles) We gotta leave. - What happened? - I'll tell you later. Come on, we gotta leave now. Let's go. (Jennifer screaming) (intense music) (swords clanking) This way! (dramatic music) Let's go this way. (weapon blasting) This one doesn't work either. - What are we gonna do? Maybe over there. - Hey, wait, wait, wait! (floor buzzing) (object clanks) Come on! Okay, go up. - There? - Come on, just go up. - I'm afraid of heights. - I don't care, come on.

(remote control beeps) (device buzzing) (dramatic music) (device beeping) - You did it. It's finally gone. - Yeah, it's over, even on my planet. That is, if he keeps his word. - Oh my god, another one's coming. (aircraft rumbling) - No, that's not another phobe, that's my commander. Why he's here, I haven't got a clue, though. I thought he'd just send some troops to take me home. (intense music) - Nice work, Greg, I knew you could do the job. - Yeah, I barely pulled this one off. So why you here anyways? All I needed was a simple ship to get outta here. - Nice job, Mr. Dapp. I believe you deserve a bonus for finding the egg as well. - Who the hell are you? - I see your commander didn't tell you. Probably a wise move on his part. I am the one that hired you. - I don't understand. You hired me for what? - To bring me my phobe, of course. I own them now. - So you mean to tell me you've been behind all this? Why would you let something that deadly out? - Oh, don't worry, Greg. You don't mind if I call you Greg, do you? - Yes, I do. - Very well, Mr. Dapp. It's not the commander's fault. He works for me too. - I can't believe you sold out. Did you need the money that bad? - It's more complicated than that, much more. - Enough of this foolishness. I have work to do. Guard, please take that trap and put it in the ship. (suspenseful music) - I can't let you take that. - You really don't have much of a choice, Mr. Dapp. I warned you, Mr. Dapp, but you just don't listen. (weapon blasting) (intense music) - Phobe's my only chance. (device buzzing) (phobe growling) (explosion booming) (phobe growling) (man thudding) (intense music) (weapon blasting) - I guess we're even now. - Thanks. (somber music) - The craft's yours, take it. (aircraft humming) - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'll be fine. - How're you gonna get home? - I was thinking of retiring anyhow. Try to find some nice place to settle down. This looks good. But I need someone to show me the ropes and teach me. - What about the trap? - I'll think of something.
