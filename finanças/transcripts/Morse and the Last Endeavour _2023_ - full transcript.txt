From the 1960s to the 21st century, the detective world of Morse created by writer Colin Dexter has been exploring the fictional crimes of Oxford. It's got such a loyal fan base, Morse, Lewis and Endeavour. People who've followed the shows right from the start. You never consider that it'll be going in ten years' time or 35 years' time. The Oxford of Morse and of Endeavour is definitely a dangerous place... Hello. GUNSHOT ..one filled with big characters. But the biggest character at the helm of it has been Inspector Morse, the detective actor John Thaw first brought to our screens back in 1987. Famous for his love of crosswords, classical music, and his iconic red Jaguar. The famous maroon-coloured Jag was an old stunt car which John himself had written off in The Sweeney in a stunt more than once. You could see the road through the floor. It was hell on wheels. But over the past two decades, since the original Morse famously left our screens... Thank Lewis... ..for me. ..the Morse universe has expanded. First with his sidekick Lewis picking up the murderous threads in 2006. Who am I looking for? Definitely somebody with blood on their clothes or their person. Thanks, Doc. And for the past decade, the series Endeavour has told Morse's back story as a brilliant young copper in '60s Britain. Who's a clever boy, then? But after nine series, the last-ever episode of Endeavour has been shot and the epic story of one of TV's most popular detectives is finally coming to an end. Being the last-ever Endeavour director is scary. I hope I get it right. The final episode... ..it brings it all together and I hope there'll be a few surprises for people. It all comes to a crescendo, you know, at the end. It's hard to describe. It's rather lovely though. It has actually been one of the privileges of my life to work with this group of people. I feel a lot of gratitude to have been part of something that so many people have enjoyed. This is for everyone, and all the fans who are involved, with Morse, Lewis and Endeavour, and this is the end, so let's have fun. MORSE CODE BEEPING The character of Inspector Morse first featured in the award-winning crime novels written by Colin Dexter back in 1975. KEVIN: Colin was very much an academic and I think, when Kenny McBain found the Morse books, and tracked Colin down, Colin was a bit taken aback. I can remember when he didn't really quite understand how films worked, to start with. But it was in 1987, when actor John Thaw took on the TV role, that the wider world got to know and love the cranky academic detective. Somebody of my age, all of us remember the Morse theme during the '90s. And remember the Morse series and how loved that was and John thaw's legacy in that. I need to be off duty on the dot tonight. Val's dead set on going to this slimming promotion. It's a special... I don't need to hear the details. I don't often ask, sir. Square up to the case, Lewis, maybe we can both be off on the dot. CHARLOTTE: How incredibly important that series is to British television culture and history. But I think also to the genre. With regular audiences of 15 million viewers, Morse was a huge hit both at home and abroad... SPEAKING SPANISH ..and ran for the next 13 years. KEVIN: I'm hugely proud of them. I still get work now from the kudos that I get from the Morse franchises. In January 2012, 12 years after the original Inspector Morse left our screens, the clocks were set back to 1965. And actor Shaun Evans got to explore the back story of television's most enigmatic detective. At that point I'd never seen any of the previous TV show, so I came at it fresh, and then I was intrigued then about... ..how we could see this character as a younger man. For me, it's a coming-of-age story. Of how we take this period of time and take this man from his late twenties, right through to his mid thirties. My name is Bright, Chief superintendent Bright. It's centred on a police station somewhere in Oxfordshire, and you have the young Morse, who is a troubled character. Secondly... The brilliant detective. Thinks out of the box. And he always comes at everything from a strange angle. Evelyn Balfour was strangled, sir, like Desdemona, Othello's wife. And there was a handkerchief stuffed in her mouth embroidered with the initial "D". The detective element is important, yes, but it's a sort of Trojan horse to get into who this person was. Squeamish, are we? You won't make much of a detective if you're not prepared to look death in the eye. Find me when you're done. It's got an unlikely character at the helm of it, you know, this... He is not your hero, he's not your average detective. He is an appreciator of classical music, of art, of architecture, of man's achievements at its highest, I suppose. # ..the beginning # Is now and ever shall be... # It can't be separated from this story. And so then it's important to show them as much as you can. And this new world of crime expanded beyond Morse to include a much wider cast of regular characters. 25 years ago, I got the best bit of luck any man ever had. The toast is... my Win. Win. 'It's a beautifully written period drama.' There's the through line of the main characters, whose lives you see emerging and changing. APPLAUSE 'That's why people love it.' It is more than just a detective drama. I think that's selling it short. Where have you been all night? Don't ask. So... are you dancing? Are you asking? It's got wonderfully nuanced characters that you want to meet time and time again. ALL: ..2, 1... CHEERING I suppose what's lovely about the series of Endeavour is that there's just that plotting. We've got all nine series to see how he becomes the Inspector Morse that we know he's destined to be. But the back story to Morse wasn't actually the work of original author Colin Dexter. Endeavour was the creation of writer Russell Lewis. Television writers don't normally write every single episode of a series. Particularly not when there's 36, and particularly not when there's 36 of 90 minutes. It's very, very unusual. Russell has such a way of writing, not only his dialogue, but his stage directions. I really wish people could see his scripts, because they are so detailed. Up a bit. Up a bit more. CROWD CHEERING ON TV Left a bit. Ah... Knowing the show as he did, he wrote for Morse, he wrote for Lewis, there is very rarely a character name, an address, a name of a department store, you name it, there will be a connection to something within the Morse universe. And Russell Lewis was inspired to create one very special character for an actor with a personal connection to John Thaw. So, what's the story? Well, there isn't one... yet. I play Dorothea Frazil, who is the editor of the Oxford Mail newspaper. If that's for the morning edition, you're cutting it fine. My agent called me and said that they were looking for a young John Thaw basically to play the young Endeavour. And did I know anyone who reminded me of my father? I couldn't imagine it. I said, well, I want a part in it. Just be a nice little quirky thing. And Russ and I talked and he wrote a little scene for me. Have we met? I... I don't think so. Another life, then? I wasn't expecting anything as lovely and as moving as that. I thought I was just gonna be plonked on a desk. But, no, Russ had a much better idea. And the rest is history. And Dorothea has remained a key character across all nine seasons of the hit detective series. It's such an interesting character, I think, Dorothea Frazil. Like she's this woman existent in this man's world. Actually, Ms Frazil, I'd urge you in the strongest possible terms not to make this communication known to the public. As a favour. 24 hours. After that... Pray that's enough. Morse. Another key character created for the series was Detective Inspector Fred Thursday, who played mentor to the fledgling detective Endeavour Morse. You're here on merit. Not that you'd know by the state of you. You might have found time to run an iron. That shirt looks like you slept in it. First impressions, Morse. Thursday really wants to help Endeavour. 'And he's a prickly bugger.' I'm a good detective. And a poor policeman. No-one can teach you the first, any fool can learn the second. Fred's task, as he sees it, is to turn him into a good copper, and not get quite so highfalutin', you know, in the possible solving of all these crimes. One day I'll send you out for a routine enquiry, and it will turn out to be just that. I won't hold my breath. You'd find something suspicious in a saint's sock drawer. With Morse and Lewis, that is reversed. Morse is the senior man. If anyone wants me, they'll find me looking at fish... ..through the bottom of a beer glass. I think the relationship between Thursday and Endeavour is sadder than the one with Lewis and Morse. FRED: Go home. Put your best record on. Loud as it'll play. And with every note, you remember... ..that's something that the darkness couldn't take from you. If you look at Endeavour, it's working class old sweat that's keeping this very bright young cop on the right track. So it's quite similar to the Lewis situation, except that Shaun is a lot better looking than the rest of us. So you've got a very handsome Morse. But otherwise, it's the same situation. OPERATIC SINGING It's hugely important that Oxford is a character in the series. Thank you, Professor. One of the things Oxford is best known for, besides the university etc, is the Inspector Morse series of books and the Inspector Morse and Lewis and now Endeavour series. It is the last time in Endeavour's series history that we are in Oxford. And Endeavour is visiting the joke shop, looking for evidence. SHOP BELL RINGS Bye now. I say, I say, I say, what can I do for you, then, sir? He asked him knowingly. It's a sad time for everybody, we will miss everybody in Oxford, who makes us welcome, and we will, of course, miss coming together away for three or four nights as a team to get the material that is always so, so beautiful. Especially on a day like today. People come to see us. Sometimes they travel from really quite a long way away as well. I've been following Endeavour really since the beginning. I stumbled across their filming in season one. And then in season two, I took them some cakes down. And it's spiralled from there. To acknowledge this Oxford universe of Morse coming to an end, Julia created a particularly special cake. It's terribly, terribly sweet. When we were in Oxford this time, we got that enormous cake. With lots of brilliant sort of icing on it, that was newspapers and Fred and Morse at the top. It was the most remarkable thing. All my lovely locations. I've got that in the back of my car still. 3, 2, 1. The Endeavour crew are really welcoming. Mm. It's nice. And I'm not a cake lover. You get lots of tourists who are fascinated and then you get the hardcore fans that come specially and usually we are allowed to skulk in a corner in a safe place out of the way. But they never stop us. The Endeavour fans are amazing. I don't know how they know where we are, but they always do. I'm from Boston in the United States. In the US, you wouldn't get near filming as closely as the people here seem to do. They are sweet, they are part of the Endeavour family. Amazing likeness. You might look about 40 years older than you do, Rog. But don't worry about it. One distinct addition to the '60s world of Morse was the relationship between Endeavour and the family life of his boss, Fred Thursday. A lot to be said for family. And what if you don't have any? Do you think that's how you end up your days? Alone in some two-bob kip? Nothing but a bottle for company? There was often the contrast between the warm and loving Thursday family and Morse as the outsider. Sit yourself down. He won't be a tick. The family is a place where he can get away from the disturbances and the violence that the job often presents him with. We see that lightness, without his hat on, enjoying his dinner round the table. And I think the audience love those scenes. Morse, don't stand on ceremony. Budge up, Sam. You shouldn't have let me sleep, sir. It looked like you could do with it. Mrs Thursday has done you some tea. Win, dear. Endeavour as a character wants to be part of that family, and wants that safety. And the linchpin of the Thursday household was Fred's wife, Win. Early on in the series, I think my main sort of... thrust was bringing tea and making sandwiches. The way you went out of here this morning I didn't even get a chance to do your sandwiches. You got time now? No, I just popped back to get my pipe. Left it in the shed. I'll do you a quick round. I do feel she is an integral part of the show, you know, I do feel that, and I do feel the audience love her. I'm there in the morning giving him his sandwiches and saying... Come home safe. ..which is another one of her little isms. She always says, "Come home safe." But playing Win Thursday wasn't actor Caroline O'Neill's first journey into the Morse universe. I had a little tiny appearance in Lewis many moons ago. My husband was murdered. So I did get the opportunity to work with them on that. That's Reg. Thanks, Mrs Chapman. Cup of tea? There have been a few actors who have come in... I know Roger did an Inspector Morse. Those links are wonderful. The journalism, that's your only connection with Mr Owens? Absolutely. Are you sure, sir? Because, you see, we believe he was engaged in blackmail. Good God. People are absolutely obsessed with Morse. People do dissertations on it in university. Which is very touching. And as those university experts will know, back in the year 2000, after 13 years and 33 episodes, the original series of Inspector Morse became famous for its bold decision to kill off its title character. For Morse to actually die on screen was quite a big deal, well, it was a huge deal... at the time I didn't quite catch that, Morse. Thank Lewis... ..for me. In 2006, Kevin Whately returned to the Oxford crime scene, this time as the lead detective Lewis. Who the hell are you? Inspector Lewis, Sergeant Hathaway. Oxfordshire Police. Audiences like to feel that relaxed with characters and are used to having that friendly face in the corner of their room. I think that there's definitely a through line through all the films and the different franchises. But there's a different dynamic on Endeavour, because Russell's got the historic thing and he links it to whatever is going on, which is very clever. Given that it's set 50 years prior to where we are now, when you look at the things that have happened socially and politically, and you're able to hold the mirror up, in a more artful way, then that's when I think it works. Rather than just a... attractive chocolate box of a show, you know what I mean. It becomes something else. My husband had Hitler's ear. WE could have persuaded him... ..softened his resolve. He wasn't immune to reason. Charming conversationalist, no doubt. As an audience member I can watch it and think, God, this is extraordinary, how Russell writes these incredibly complex episodes that are linked to, you know... whether it's politics in the '70s, racism, the strikes... That's one of the things that all drama does very, very well and has been doing from time immemorial. You know, looking... looking at the past, and using that as a way of looking where we are now. There's an episode that Joan was in and it kind of coincided with the Black Lives Matter. ALL: Integration for a nation. Integration for a nation. CLAPPING The sign on this door says "No coloureds". This is the language of segregation. It's great that we can look back to reflect, to see, in some sense, how far we've come, and in other senses, how far we still need to come. One of the strengths of Endeavour is the attention to detail, and that's across the board, you know, with the crew and the music and the casting. There's so much detail that's gone into it. And one character with an attention to detail second only to Morse is their resident pathologist. Ah. Max DeBryn is the resident Home Office pathologist. So he's... he's good at his job, he's skilled. People always seem to like the directness. Anything, Doc? Well... his head's in this room and his body's in that room, so that... might have something to do with it. People seem to love that. Time of death? Two thousand years ago. Two thousand years? Yes. Give or take a couple of hundred years. Might have trouble notifying his next of kin. What a brilliant character Max DeBryn is. This morbid humour and these witticisms and sayings. Male, late 50s, early 60s. What's with all the, er, blood? Someone's stuck a broken bottle in his neck. I didn't realise how much forensics had changed until I did a bit of research. DEBRYN: Whether that's what did for him, or he was already on his way out, I'm afraid I won't be able to express an opinion until after the postmortem. Shall we say two o'clock? Cut there. Beautiful. Print that, please. Thank you. And for actor James Bradshaw, understanding the details of his fictional job has always been important. DNA didn't actually come into being used as a forensic tool until the 1980s. Even wearing surgical gloves at a crime scene didn't become standard procedure until 1972. So it was just fascinating to find all this stuff out. It looks to be a cap badge. And as the serious Morse fans know, the character of Max DeBryn is one of the few original characters to appear from the 1980s TV series. Oh, by the way... ..he wore a hearing aid. He was played by Peter Woodthorpe in the original series. My job, sir, is to certify death where it has occurred and to ascertain, where possible, the physical causes. Now, Inspector Morse came out, I would have been 11, 12. I had a vague memory of it. I think I looked at a picture of Peter Woodthorpe, and there was the bow tie and the glasses, so I kept that in mind. Plus the one other original character was, of course, Police Constable Jim Strange. Jim Strange is a career policeman, and he has... no ulterior motives, other than advancement. Congratulations, by the way... Sergeant Strange. Yeah, well... Lot of piles, eh? An advancement that would see the character become Chief Superintendent Strange - and eventually Endeavour's boss. Fundamentally, there's a part of Endeavour that Strange will never understand. They both very much get on with what they do. Look, matey, I know it's no locked-room mystery, but sometimes, the simplest answer is the right one. What have you got against it being him? Nothing. I'm just trying to keep an open mind. It is the job, isn't it? Where they've clashed is their personalities, which are absolutely chalk and cheese. With 36 episodes, Endeavour has now become the longest running series in the trio of Morse detective adventures, and it has never neglected to acknowledge its roots, from John Thaw's Morse of the 1980s to the cameos by writer Colin Dexter, whose original novels have now inspired over four decades of TV crime. I actually had the joy of sitting on a bus with Colin Dexter. He sat in front of me. And it was just brilliant. Cos, you know, it's like, "Oh, my God, I can't believe it!" I hadn't had the pleasure of meeting him until then. And although Colin died back in 2017, the series continued to honour him. We try and have a little thing of Colin Dexter somewhere in each of the films, whether it's a poster on the wall, or a bust in the library... It's important, a nod to the heritage. As long as it's not overwhelming, I think. You know, as long as it's... it's become a part of the story. And in recent years, lead actor Shaun Evans has taken on a bigger role in the storytelling of the series. One of the draws of the job for me, you know, as soon as I realised it was gonna go a little further than just a one-off, to see... "Oh, actually, I could learn, by the end of this, "how to be broader, how to be able to tell stories, "not just from an acting point of view." The first one that I directed of Endeavour was Apollo, and it's about the moon landing. NEIL ARMSTRONG: 'Tranquility base here. The Eagle has landed. 'I'm going to step off the LM now. 'That's one small step for man, 'one giant leap for mankind.' I have no idea how he did it, and I think that's a string to his bow that he wants to develop more. MAN: Camera set. And... action. But some of the text that he has to speak, while he's keeping a director's hat on, was ridiculously difficult. Jeff Slayton's personal assistant is murdered, his scientific adviser dies in a car crash intended for someone else, and not 48 hours later, one of his puppeteers is found dead. I would say they were connected. And now, cos I'm now getting old, and I have to learn my words weeks in advance, I just look with horror at the stuff that he has to do. But he seems to thrive on it. Working on it for a period of time, and also peering back the curtain and being... and starting to direct and whatnot has made me approach all of the work in a different way. And cut. Let's give that another whirl, please, my friends. He's in it 100%, and it's interesting, cos I think there's parts of Morse that are quite like Shaun as well. His dedication to the work, and his detail that he puts into his work. There was one scene in particular where he had to find a tape at the back of a doll's house. And for a couple of takes, what he did was, he asked one of the crew to hide it in a different place each time, so that he would actually have to go and find it. So he was actively searching, as opposed to just acting the search. I think someone was looking for something... only they didn't find it, because... ..she had hidden it somewhere safe. It's just things like that. Those little bits that you think, you've been doing this for so long, and it would be so easy to say, "I've got this." You know, "I'll just phone it in." But he never, ever did that. Across 36 years, the streets and spires of Oxford have become home to the television universe of Morse. And at the heart of it all has been one complex character. Like any good protagonist on TV, he's a man of layers, and there are a lot of different Endeavours. For people who've watched the show over the years, you'll have seen the hardworking detective, the romantic, the melancholic, the alcoholic, the depressive. You've seen him as a good friend, a bad friend. You've seen him as a good detective, a bad detective. Don't ever do that again. When I'm questioning a suspect, I expect you to back me. Questioning a suspect? If you wanna take a leaf out of Thursday's book, there's better places to start! Look, let's get one thing straight, matey. You don't tell me. I tell you, all right? Job calls for brains, you'll be the first in the queue. Something like this, leave it to those who've got the sand. He contains multitudes. But I think probably one of his cornerstones is that he's a bit grumpy. But that's why we love him. But who loved this somewhat unlovable character? John Thaw's Inspector Morse was a regular flirt. Even with suspects, played by familiar actors and voice-over artists. Can you at least remember what he had to drink? Sherry. Medium, I think. That's better than the stuff that passes for ale in there, anyway. Well, that, I wouldn't know. I don't drink much at the best of times, and never at lunch. I like to be in complete command of myself when I'm working, Inspector. Really? I like to let go. I always drink at lunchtime. It helps my imagination. But there were many women with whom he had relationships. You're known around here as one of the good guys, Morse. But no love was ever convinced to stay. I'm sorry. You're very nice. I've just had enough of men for the moment, OK? And the root of the detective's failed love life became the cornerstone of the Endeavour backstory. What do they call you, then? Morse. Endeavour has had this thing about Joan, we know. But he's had a thing about quite a number of other people as well, and hasn't done too badly on the front of having relationships. You know, with the lovely nurse. FIREWORKS He's had so many lovely women over the series that he's had brief relationships with. And he doesn't seem to be able to forge relationships. They say you're never so alive as when you're close to death. Well, maybe the reverse is also true. Jesus! It's just sex. It's not love. I know. I suppose he is conflicted. But he's a solitary figure, isn't he? For Morse, there was one love that was there right from the start. Fred and Win's daughter, Joan. The first few episodes, she's going out on dates, and you see her kind of being quite mischievous with Morse, you know, trying to wind him up. Well, don't stand on ceremony! Er, it's probably best if I wait in the... I think it's probably best if you just do as you're told. HE CHUCKLES You wouldn't say they were, you know, the perfect pair, in the sense that she's quite outgoing, he's quite awkward. It's interesting, cos with the kind of love story that emerged, it was really early on... There was an episode where Jakes takes Joan out for a date. MUSIC PLAYING Endeavour walks her home after it goes wrong. And I remember, in the stage directions, Russell had written: "This is the moment he will look back on "as the moment that he knew he'd fallen in love." I thought I'd be all right with a copper. Well, there are coppers and there are coppers. What sort are you? I'm the sort that see young ladies safely home. 'Joan has been on quite a journey.' We see her quite bright-eyed and bushy-tailed right at the beginning. She's still living with her mum and dad, she's taken quite a respectable job at the bank, doing the right thing. It's a lunch HOUR, Miss Thursday. Sorry, Mr Fordyce. I'll make it up. Indeed you will, Miss Thursday. And then there's that incident at the bank with Endeavour. Nobody move, this is a robbery! COMMOTION, SHOUTING She's going for the bell! OK! What are you doing?! Stop, stop! Don't look at me! He happens to be there as well. It's a good job you're here. I mean, I'm glad. If it's any comfort. Me too. We see, through the series, how that kind of life has taken its toll on her as well. Stay. I can't. Just give it time. I'm a huge admirer of Sara. She's a terrific actress. Take care of yourself, Morse. You too, Miss Thursday. I think what we've... or, I hope what we've achieved, very subtly, is those dynamic shifts. I've made such a mess. I don't know what to do. There was one point where I said... Marry me. And she goes. She doesn't marry him. SHE EXCLAIMS Morse, I... I don't want your pity. Every time I got a script, I was thinking, this is gonna be it. You know, is there gonna be this kiss? 'Is there gonna be this moment? 'Are they going to finally get together?' Do you want to come in? For coffee? Yeah. Over the series, there are those moments where they look at each other and... you just think, "Oh, go on, do it now! You know, "Kiss each other now, profess..." I don't go much for coffee. Right to the bitter end, we get those, all the way along. Actually, I should probably go. You just got here. Yeah, work. I just wanted to wish you well. I... just love the bones of her. You know, she's just exciting to play, and... I'll be sad to get my hair back-combed for the last time. SHE LAUGHS Action! APPLAUSE We've got our biggest day of the shoot today. We have got a wedding, so we've got all our regular cast, for the first time in the show's history. And also, shooting with the amount of crowd that we have here today, all the wedding guests, it's an enormous team effort. This is one of the first occasions, if not THE first occasion, where we've all been together, as a cast. We had the reception, and I got to have a dance with Mrs Thursday, and... Sort of chatting to Dorothea, Abby's character. Yeah, it was great. Just lovely. We all tend to have our little sort of boxes of characters, and this time, having this wedding has brought us all together, just like a real wedding. And the sort of bittersweet fact that Joan and Strange have got together and it's not Endeavour and Joan - that's one thing. But on the other hand, it's also very joyous, and it seems sort of the right thing to do, to all end at a wedding. And finally, Joan and Jim's wedding. Action! CROWD CHEERING After much anticipation, Joan had said yes to marrying not Morse, but the other long-running detective in the series. Jim Strange. We had absolutely everybody there. And we had a lot of fun, a lot of laughs, as we tend to do whenever there were groups of us getting together to shoot scenes. But this happy occasion was, of course, fraught for one key character. Endings can be very difficult, cos you're trying to tie everything up, and you can't please all the people all the time. There's a beautiful scene in the last episode, where Joan is about to be married. And she goes over to Morse, and she says... You know, I don't think you've ever called me by my name. Have I not? No. Well, that's probably for the best. How's that? Because if I had... said it once out loud, I think I might never have been able to stop. Truth is... ..I love you. ANTON LESSER: And you think, "Oh, my God!" It's so brilliant. And then he says everything that you've wanted him to say for all this time. I should have said something. I should have said something. And now it's too late. No. It's not. And then... It's just been in his head. I don't think you've ever called me by my name. Have I not? No. Course. Mrs Strange. Well, you might give me a hug. Oh... For luck. MAN: And cut there. But it's everything, as a viewer, you've been wanting him to do, you know, all this time. For goodness' sake, just go and grab her and tell you love her! And it's-it's beautiful, really beautiful. I suppose he's filled with feelings of regret, that he didn't just do that much earlier on in the series. But then, of course, he doesn't realise we wouldn't have had a really good series! HE LAUGHS It couldn't have ended early on with Morse and Joan settling down, because we know that Inspector Morse didn't do that. Never married? That's right. How is that? Do you mind? Not being married? Sometimes. Sometimes I mind. SHAUN EVANS: It's interesting, isn't it? Because... I've got a lot of thoughts about it, really, a lot of feelings about it. It's good... for the character to be able to get that off his chest. Even if it's only in a fantasy sequence. But ultimately, Endeavour doesn't get the girl. That was always a given. Thursday is never mentioned in the Inspector Morse, either the books or the series. So something has to happen with those two characters which means that I never mention them again. That's where those two things have to end. And that's where we decided to end our story. We're here at Air Studios. We're recording the very last episode of Endeavour. One of the great privileges of this job is working with the composer, Barrington, and then Matt. Recorded with a full orchestra, which is not that common for TV. The London Metropolitan Orchestra was specially formed in 1986 to record Barrington Pheloung's original theme tune and the score for the music for Inspector Morse. The baton passed to his collaborator Matt Slater when he died. The journey that all of us in this orchestra, and musicians that have worked on this over the years, the thousands of hours of work that have gone into it, with both Barry Pheloung's scores, mine, it's... I don't think there's anything been quite like it. And 36 years later, the orchestra who have recorded the scores of all 102 episodes of Inspector Morse, Lewis and Endeavour are gathering to record for the very last time. Let's do this. We're gonna have an amazing day. This is for everyone and all the fans who are involved with Morse, Lewis and Endeavour. And this is the end, so let's have fun. Matt was determined that on the very last one, we would have this get-together. Here we go, two bars into one. ORCHESTRA PLAYS: 'Endeavour Theme' Standing on the podium, and you've got everybody around you. You've got the orchestras, you've got cast members. That moment, of those final, final notes, I was shivers, just even thinking about it. They mean so much to so many people. MUSIC CONTINUES FINAL NOTES FADE APPLAUSE Sitting there, in the middle of the orchestra... I dunno. It's kind of a... wild feeling, the music all around you. Yeah, it's good. It's kind of emotional for the guys as well. They've been doing this far longer than I have. There's very few moments in life that you get where you know instantly that moment is incredibly special. Looking at everyone's faces, tears in their eyes, the emotion of going through the score and what it meant to them... I don't think I'll ever get anything like that again. I'm so proud to be part of it. 36 years after the first episode of Morse was filmed, the final scene for the complex detective who the public have loved the world over required a very pertinent piece of music. It's been the finale scene of Endeavour ever, which I'm so glad I'm doing. Endeavour is in a choir, and they're singing Faure's Requiem: In Paradisum. There was a lot of conversations about... what music it would be, whether there would be a choir. MAN: Turning over. WOMAN: Rolling. Quiet, please. And playback. CHOIR SINGING That piece has been played, I believe, in the very first episode of Endeavour. I think that's when he arrived, on the bus. We thought this would be a fitting closure. FAURE'S REQUIEM CONTINUES As we were up there and singing it and filming, the writer came in, Russ. And then the producer came in. And when they came in, each of them filled up... ..and got a little bit emotional. There was a feeling of... all of the experiences that we've had perhaps coming to an end. So it was a release. Is that it? That's it. It's spine-tingling, and I hope the audiences will have been moved by it and understand that it's just that little comma, before we hit John Thaw as Inspector Morse in the '80s.
