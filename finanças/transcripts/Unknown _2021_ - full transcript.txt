Oh my God! Got a white male, 28, he's sustained 37 stab wounds, mainly to the chest, neck, but also the torso, and pelvis. Not one witness. We got a whole fucking bloodbath, and not one damned witness? I guess this is their MO? Who knows? All right, I've seen enough. Cover him up. The Mayor arrived. So, you see, we all birds, but the difference between me and the Sheriff? He a pigeon and I'm an eagle. I don't want wanna hear excuses, I want answers. We're doing everything we can to get answers for you ASAP. Look, you think this connected to the other two murders? You have any suspects, a witness? There is a possible connection, and we don't have an answer for all other questions yet, but we have some of our top agents on it now. E... excuse me, sir. Here's what I do know, that this is not a good look for you, the sheriff's department, or me. This, this was intentional, yo. Definitely not an accident. Look, I'm the best man this city ever had, and the best you ever had. Wow. I need you to get with my publicist, come up with something. Any sign of domestic abuse? Drugs? I need everybody to keep combing. What do you think now? Follow me. Hm. Anything else? Aw. You can't take it, can you? You know, that's probably why we lasted just one date. No, we had one date because you couldn't play your role, that's why you didn't end up in the office, but... Okay, boys and girls, let's wrap this up, before the media have a field day. Okay, listen, Sheriff Stance already has a search on hand. So what we gonna do is go to... Sheriff Stance. Lee, what the hell do you want me to put in the report? Say he was dancing and he slipped. Fucking serious? All right, look, I don't know what you wanna do, Sheriff, but guess what? I need arrests, and I need it now. No, I want you to solve this. You just got that big, pretty house. And guess what? If you don't solve this, I'm going to fire you, and the whole sheriff department. All right, guys, we got one hour to wrap this up. Okay, you heard him. Oh my God, please don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! Come on, buddy. You did this once, you can do it again. All right? Hey, babe! Hey, pumpkin patch. How are you doing? Look at you in that dress and those shoes and that face. - Come here. - Aw. Come here. How's things going at the, uh, at the boutique? Good. Yeah. I got the mannequins in today. Oh, yeah? I'm still waiting on the display tables, and the handyman needs to fix the bathrooms. Oh, yeah. Speaking of handymen. - Did you fix the door? - I didn't fix the door. You really need to fix this door. Attagirl! Thanks. How'd the writing go today? Good, good. Yeah, uh, I think I made a breakthrough. Great. I can't wait to read it. Um, uh, whose turn is it to do dishes? I got 'em. Good. I'm gonna get some afternoon sun. Okay. I will stand by you. I'll always pick you up. You were my new beginning. I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Oh, sh... Oh! Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to tell you that I love you. I love you, too, baby. All right. Well, I don't want to distract you. I'm going to go get ready. Okay. I'm so glad we're having people over. I was beginning to feel like we were becoming my parents. You think I'm your dad? That's pretty creepy, babe. No, I mean, you know what I mean! We used to go out with couples all the time. Now I'm so busy at the boutique, and you're constantly in front of the computer, and at night we're just come home and collapse. You know what? Life is going to pass us by, and one day we're going to wake up, and realize that we missed it. So tonight, let's just have fun. Deal? No talk about work. No. Can't argue with you in that dress. So I got to ask, like, whose idea was the bow tie? The matching? Who do you think? I am just so awful to these two. I don't know how they put up with me. It's totally forgiven as long as you don't have the matching Christmas pictures with everyone in the same color, you know what I mean? Actually, I was thinking of that. How did you know, Michael? Reindeer sweaters for everyone. So, a whole year? Yeah, a whole year. Not a drop, man. - Not even cough syrup. - Yeah. And, uh, that is next. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Now, you need to learn to eat like a big boy already, because you are a big boy, Mason. Oh, I'm sorry, Kat. I'll help you clean this up. It's fine. Um, so, Michael, tell us about the new book. We've heard so much about it. I got to tell you, it's kicking my butt, but I'm trooping through. Good. Well, I loved Knight Fire, so if you ever need anyone to give this version a read, I'm your woman. Yeah. Good luck with that. He doesn't even let me read it. Yeah. Top secret. Mm hm. No way. It would drive me absolutely nuts, if Bill was working on something this big - and kept it from me. - Aw. Well, I can't wait till it's ready. She means it, she tells all her friends she knows the guy who wrote that Knight book, you know? - Really? - Yeah, yeah. Oh. Thank you. Then she asks why I can't be a writer. You can be a writer, man. No, I don't know the first thing about writing. I didn't know how to write a book 'til I wrote a book. I still don't know how to write a book. Make it up as you go along. So, is this new one a continuation of the last one? Kind of, same main characters. Oh, so question of the evening, is the Knight coming back? The Knight is coming back, yes, yes. Yay! He makes it so much fun. What a great character. Thank you. Everybody likes the Knight. Toast. - Toast. - Sounds good. - To friendship. - To friendship. Cheers. Cheers. I'd make a great mommy. Wouldn't our daughter be adorable? Are you coming to bed? Coming. What are you doing? Uh I... I thought I heard something. Did you set the alarm? Yeah. God. I'm thinking I'm hearing something. I keep having this dream where something's whispering in my ear. And I think I understand 'em. Then I wake up, and I have no idea what they're saying. That's odd, huh? Yeah, it's weird. Well, I'm off to bed. Don't be long. Okay. So, when will you be finished with your book? I don't know, baby. Uh, a month, just to finish the first draft. And there's editors notes, and publisher's notes and notes' notes, and... Yeah, it takes forever to finish a book. Yeah. Tell me about it. I want to be Stephen King. I wanna write, like 12 a week. That's nice. Yeah, that feels really good. You are so beautiful. You know that? You are so beautiful. I wanna feel you. Mm. I want you inside me. - I wanna have your baby. - What? Is that what this is about? Can't you see that that's what I want? Can we not talk about this right now? When can we talk about it? We've... we've talked about this, a 100 times. I... I'm almost 37 years old, I mean, most of my friends are on their second or third kid by now. I mean, every single day that we wait is another day that we don't get to spend with our child. Look, can we just... have a little faith? Just let me finish my book! That's all. Then we can talk about family. That's what he said about me opening my boutique. Yeah, what's the real reason? Why are you pulling away? That's the real reason. I... I'm, I'm under pressure, I want to finish my book. Fuck you! I know what the real fucking reason is. Yeah. What's the real reason? You're not attracted to me. What do you... you fucking want some 18 year old? You want some fucking, stupid... fucking young chick? - Am I told old for you? - Oh my... Oh my God. Because then you can just wait for 20 more years. Why do you just give me what I want? Good night. You know, I thought, after three years, you would've grown up. Wednesday, 2:44 a.m. Remember me? End of messages. Wednesday, 2:44 a.m. Remember me? All right. Okay. Okay. Hello, old chap. Long time, no see! I missed our tittle-tattles. Oh. Trouble with the missus, eh? Not too worry, belly up to the barmaid! Hah! Cheers, to one year of sobriety, and many more. Couldn't have done it without you, baby. Look, I'm... I'm really sorry about the other night. It's just seeing Bill and Mary's son... Hey, stop. I would probably be dead, or in the gutter, if you hadn't have dried me out. So as far as I'm concerned, there isn't an 18 year old in the world that could take your place. Ugh, can you get that? Hello. Hello? You have any idea what time it is? Remember me? Who is this? Remember me? Who is this? Who was it? Wrong number. Remember me? End of messages. Any idea who it could be? No. Same as the other night. But it was a woman's voice. That's weird. You don't recognize it either? Nope. Yeah, it's probably just some kids fooling around. Well, hopefully they'll get a life. I have a hard enough time sleeping as it is. Love you. Hi, Mitch! I'm one year sober, as of yesterday. It's one day at a time, man. Um, alcohol is a disease. And I tried to convince myself and everybody else, that um, I could beat that disease on my own, and I... I could for a little while, you know, like a day or two. But it took someone who loved me more than I love the bottle to shake me out of it, you know, to show me what it was that I was throwing away. And she saved my life because she forced me to come to these meetings, or she'd leave me. And this is someone who stuck by me, after I had a debilitating accident, a week after I met her. I knew that if my disease was pushing her away, then I had to do something because I could not afford to lose her. You don't have to have someone at home to succeed, but um, it sure as hell helps. That's all I got. It's really good to see you today, Mike. A year! Bet it felt like a century, huh? Yeah, it's had its moments. Just remember, everybody here has been where you are. And if you ever need anything, you know, I'm here for ya. Hey. You okay? Everything okay? I, uh, I'm having those hallucinations again, man. - Did you slip? - Of course not. Of course not. - Man, look, here's the thing. - Hold on. It's the same thing that used to happen when I was drinking after the accident. Only now, this shit's happening when I'm sober. - Okay. - I'm scared. Okay. Wh... when did these hallucinations start? About four days ago. All right. Anything unusual happen in your life? The... anything overwhelming, you know, some stress from out of nowhere, you know? Anything like that? No, man, just the same as always. Katherine wants to have a baby. I can't finish the novel. How's the book coming? Hah, fucking brutal. I keep waiting for inspiration to come, show me what to do, and it just won't come. Well, hey, look, just be open to it. And it will. Okay? It will come. Jesus, Michael, please do something! Look, you son of a bitch! Remember me? Who is this? Remember me? Who is this? Where are your parents? Remember me? Where are your parents? I'm going to call the fuck... God damn it! Remember me? Remember me? Remember me? - Don't do that! - What? Don't jump out at me like that. I'm so sorry. I... I, you were yelling... There was this kid's voice on the phone. - Look at the fridge... - What? Look at what? Nothing. - Are you okay? - No. No, I'm not. Um, who do we know with a daughter? Who's got kids? Who's... who's got kids, baby? Who's got kids? I know a lot of people with kids. I'm going back to bed. Someone's here, somebody's in the house! Shh! Shh! No, I'm coming with you. Stay close. I have a weapon! I'm sorry. Shh! We have another call coming in from Sherwood drive, can someone check that out? Well? I checked all around the house. And there's no sign of a forced entry. Maybe it a raccoon, or some other vermin. Triggered the alarm. That's pretty common in these parts. Wh... That happens? No, no. We've been here for three years. It's never happened. Maybe someone got drunk and set off the system, stumbling around in the dark. Really? I... I've been sober for a year, Sheriff, so. I've seen people sober 30 years, then step right back into old habits without missing a day. He... he doesn't drink. I've been taking care of him. Well, isn't Mr. Lane a lucky man to have you watch his back? Hey, you know, while you're here, we've been getting these really weird phone calls at all hours of the night. Is... is there anything you can do about that? It's probably just kids making prank calls. No, it's not. It's different people. One of them was a young child... Yeah, that's the burglary on Sherwood. False alarm. Deputy's going for a coffee, did you want anything? Why don't you tell the deputy to stay put till I get back? Copy that. So, are you... you going to do anything? About what? Nobody broke in. You getting prank calls from kids? Check with your neighbors, I'm sure they're getting the same calls. We have a small department here, sir. I'd like to limit the unnecessary paperwork. Now, should an actual person break in? Don't hesitate to call. Have a good evening. Yes, sir. You too. Thanks. - Asshole. - Shh! Ooh! Mitch, right? I'm Michael, your neighbor. Hey Michael, my neighbor. Good to meet you after three years. Yeah, I don't get out much. I work from home, you know? That's cool, dude. What's up? Um, look, have you, uh, have you been getting any calls? Like, in the middle of the night? People keep calling us and saying, "Remember me?" And then just hanging up. Does that sound familiar? Holy shit. You get those too? So what is it? Just someone messing around? You have any idea who it is? Yeah, it's usually one of my three ex-wives bitching that I'm late with the alimony. Well, fuck you for that. I'm sorry, man. Come on, have a beer. Alimony, that's funny! Come on! - Hello. - Hey. Uh, are you okay? Hey, baby. Yeah, everything's great. How's your day? You're not drinking, are you? What? Why would you even say that? Uh, it's just, Mary called me today. She's friends with Mitch's girlfriend. And apparently, Mitch thought you were acting weird. All I did is go over there and ask the guy if he's getting the same phone calls we are. That's it. - That's all? - T... that's all. You know, he's a bit of a dick about it, and now, apparently, he's telling the whole town. Look, it's no big deal. Remember what the sheriff said? Probably a lot of people are getting the calls. Yeah, but I'm the only one who's a drunk - for checking in on it. - That's not true. Look, Michael, uh, are you sure you're... You know what, I've got to go. Son of a bitch. Look shite. Get out of here. This isn't you. You're wasting your time. Leave. Me. Alone! You have bigger things ahead of you. You are a visionary. Am I losing it? All you need... is a little bit of inspiration. Leave me alone! You were never like this before Katherine came along. I think she's driving you to the loony bin. Leave me alone! But don't worry. I'll bring you back. Baby. I'm so sorry if... Remember me? Who the hell is this? Remember me? You stop calling me! Stop calling me, I'm... Hey, man, uh, sorry about joking around earlier. It was so uncool of me. I... Mitch, I need you to do two things. One, never, ever look at my wife again. And, two, get off my porch in the next five seconds. And if anyone hears about this conversation around town, you should know I have a 357. You're seriously threatening me? Stay on my porch and find out. Cool. I talked with Ariel, Mitch's girlfriend. She says that you threatened to shoot him. I told him to mind his own business. So you threatened to shoot him? I mentioned, as an aside, that I have a gun. How he chose to interpret it is his business. What the hell is wrong with you lately? He called me a drunk, Kat! Well, he shouldn't have said that, but, you know, maybe he was just worried about you. Maybe if you got to know some of these people, they'd be able to tell who you really are. I just feel like a stranger here, and... And I really like it here, and I want to get to know these people, and... And you're threatening them? I mean, do you really think that that helps? Do you think this helps? Do you think I need any more pressure? Kathy, could you get me the flat head, babe? Hey Kathy, could you get me the flat head, please? What, are you giving the silent treatment? Could you please get me the flat head? What are you shouting about? - Oh my... - What? - Did you see her? - Who? - The woman. - What woman? The woman in the dress. I didn't see anyone. Look, I just want you to admit that you haven't really been yourself lately. And we can figure it out from there. And I think you should apologize to Mitch. How'd it go? I mean, I'm not going to get an invite to poker night, but we're good. Aw, thank you. Yeah. You, uh, you want to call Bill and Mary? Have them bring Mason again over tomorrow? Aw, I'd love that. Yeah? Okay. I thought you said you were gonna put them on silent. I did. Message erased. Oh my God! Keep it down, I'm trying to sleep. We really are glad you guys stopped by. Mason, Mason, baby slow down. - Buddy, don't trip. - You're gonna fall. Well, we were really glad to hear from you. You know, we... we tried to call several times, but there was never any answer. Think she never heard of email. Sh! Hey, are you guys okay? Michael? Yeah, we're fine. Michael's just been really busy with his... With his book. - Good. - Yeah. Yeah, that's good. We all go through times like this, right? I mean, last year, I was a big ball of stress from UPS. Cut back my shifts, you know? But we pulled through, bad times are like good times, right? They eventually end. Yeah. I've just been so exhausted, with the opening of the boutique... Of course. And, uh, phone's just been ringing nonstop. From whom? Just different people. We... we talked to the police about it, and they finally agreed to trace the calls. That's good. Bet it'll feel good when they catch the punks, huh? They better hope the police get 'em first. 'cause if I do, I'm gonna cut off each of their fingers one by one with pinking shears, until they can never dial a fucking phone again. Well... Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Heh. The good thing is, is that nobody got hurt. I... I'm sure that the police are going to get to the bottom of it. Wait. Stop. Shot. Me shot. Mason. Mason, stop! 22. Shot me. Mason! Mason! Honey, what happened? Michael, what happened? Michael! Come on, baby, come on. Get up, get up. Bill! Did you push Mason? Hey, what did you do to my kid? Are you listening? What is wrong with... oh! Ow! Ow, ow, ow! Michael! What are you doing? Michael, stop it! Stop it, Michael! Stop! Bill! Oh my God! Get the fuck off of him! Don't touch him. Get off! Get off... God, you guys! What are you doing? Michael, what the fuck is wrong with you? I'm sorr... I can't fucking believe you. Let's go. We got to get out of here. Let's get Mason, let's get outta here. Mary, please, I... Kat, I cannot! I'm sorry. I... I played the message backwards, and that's what I heard. Yeah, I played the message backwards. Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but you've got to listen to me. I played the message backwards, I heard the... Hello? Yes. I... I'm sorry, Sheriff It's... yeah, he... He hasn't been feeling good. Can you please just let us know if you find out anything? - Thanks. - What... what did he say? Enough! You're pushing everyone away, including me. No, baby. No, listen. You said that you would always believe me as long as I told you the truth. And I'm... I'm telling you, I need you to believe me now. I... I heard something on the machine. Okay, will you just listen? No new messages. - There's a... - No new messages. The a... No new messages. No new messages. I know... I know I, uh, heard something. No new messages. No new messages. No new messages. When you... When you... When you play it backwards. I'm... She was... She said her name was Valerie Washington. Do you... Do we know a Valerie Washington? No, we don't know any Valerie! We don't know only Valerie Washington! You didn't hear anything. You can trust me. I think you need to take a break from your book. I think that the pressure is getting to you. It's okay. Now, my reasons for drinking were almost occupational. I'm a psychiatrist. And being a psychiatrist, I listen to people's problems all the time, every day. You know, on top of my own. And then, of course, my alcoholism, I... I felt that drinking was, um, my escape. Um, that I deserved it. And so, I started to drink. And... I got lost. I got very lost. I lost many things. I lost everything. I lost my job. I lost my wife. I lost my reputation. I I... lost my dignity. I lost my kids. Did it stop me? No. See, I couldn't accept the fact that I loved the next drink more than I loved my own children. But I did... that. And we all know that getting sober is just... half the battle. It's staying sober. Staying sober. Ladies and gentlemen, staying sober is the hardest thing. It's the hardest part. It is the hardest thing I've ever done. And it's the hardest part. We can all come up with an excuse to have a drink. For God's sake. You feel good, you feel bad, you feel sad, you feel happy. Hey, that was... Who's there? Who's there? Fuck. Michael. Michael. Stop it. Stop it. What are you doing? It's not in my head. It's not. - I thought we were past this. - I saw... it. I saw it again. And... And something happened here. Oh, fuck. And... and... and they... They... they. Maybe it wants the house Maybe it wants us to leave. - I thought we were past this. - Maybe it wants us to leave. Maybe the realtor lied to us. - What are you doing? - Maybe there's something she's not telling us, you know? Because um, do you know who lived here? I don't know who... who lived here before us. And maybe... And why did they leave? You know why... why... Why did they have to go? - You are insane. - These people, these things... They... they... They want us to know. They want us to know what's going on. What are you doing? You know who lived here before us? I don't know why they chose me, but they did. - And... and... and... - You drank? - Ah, fuck. - You drank? I'm not going to give them the house. - You fucking drank? - I'm not going to leave. That's not what's important. You said you would never drink. That's not what's important. - Listen to me. Listen. - Asshole. I'm just trying to protect you. From what? The boogie man. Who is trying to get us. All of the secret messages that are hidden in the phone calls. I've tried everything I can do to help you. I'm done. No, no, Katherine. I need you to believe me. I'll come back to get the rest of my stuff when you're gone. Move! Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. Well, I tried calling, but it seems you're not answering your phones. Sorry about that. Ah, it's no problem. We got some information back on those private calls. Now, you say the phone was unplugged, but it was still ringing? No, that was a mistake. I thought that sounded a little crazy. Even though what we found was a little crazy in itself. What do you mean? Well, normally we can easily trace these types of calls because all numbers, including private ones, have a trace route. What was weird was every time we tried one of your calls, our systems crashed. It worked with every other number we tried. But yours kept causing our equipment to fail. That's weird. So, we called up some tech guys and they said the problem is the trace route was connected to a... What did they call it? A null number. Null number? Meaning it doesn't exist, like an empty data set. As if it appeared out of nowhere. It had to have appeared from somewhere. Well, there is more. That name your husband gave us, Valerie, uh... Valerie Washington. Yes. Yes. She died four years ago, victim of some serial killer. Now, her murder, along with four others, were never solved. There are no witnesses, no leads. Case is now closed. I was right. Mr. Lane, I didn't see you there. I was just telling your wife... About the phone calls and... And Valerie Washington. Did... did she or any of the other victims live in this house? Well, you don't think she's calling you from beyond? No, no, no, no. None of the victims lived here, as far as I know. Why do you think they chose you? I ask myself that every day. Well, even though I'm skeptical of all sorts of paranormal activity, what do I know? She calls you again, maybe you can ask her who killed her. Move a couple of our cases to solved column. Well, I got to be getting back to the station. Sheriff Stance turned the matter over to me, so if anything else comes up, just give me a call. What happened with the sheriff? His plate is full. He loves me. That may have something to do with it too. You folks have a good evening. Sorry I didn't believe you. Let's go inside. Next message. My name is Haley Sanders. Haley Sanders Next message. Mary Ann Sanders. My name is Mary Ann Sanders. Next message. End of messages. You know, I think the deputy's onto something. I found four more names. And I get the feeling like they want me to help them, you know? Like they want me to bring them some justice to find the guy that did this. Why they picked us, I don't know, but... Babe, I've got to get some rest. I can't keep my eyes open. Okay, well, just let me know if you need anything, okay? I'll leave you the towel. Okay, baby. Baby want some... Baby? Baby? Katherine? What's happening? Sweetheart? Look, you never really know with these kinds of seizures. You're telling me she took all her medication? Absolutely. - No drugs? - No. - Not too much alcohol? - No, no, no. I'm telling you, everything was the way it should be. My best guess is she might have some kind of a infection and she may be fighting it and her body went into overdrive. What kind of infection? I don't know. I don't think it's meningitis, but we could run some tests to find out later. But... she needs her rest. And if her temperature goes up or she has another seizure, we may need to admit her, okay? - Okay. - Just keep an eye out. Okay. Larry Osmond. Vicki Johnson. Yep. That's the rest of them. At least what I can tell. What do you mean? Don't you have the records? Not here. Just a single photo and some basic information. A name, age, birth date, a brief description and date of death. No proper files. How can that be? Well, newer deputies don't get access to confidential files. All we have is what is already on public records. But you can get access, right? Only with the sheriff's permission. And he's not going to grant that. Look, even if he did... let me see them, they're confidential. I can't tell you what's in them. But I can solve these murders. Let's not get carried away. Now, Sheriff Stance doesn't want to go through this anymore. And he pulled me off. He's advised me not to have any more contact with you. What? He's afraid you're going to give the families false hope. Now I can lose my job just by having this conversation. I'm sorry, Michael. I wish there was more I could do. My advice to you, for what it's worth: Let the past stay that way. Yeah. They won't let me. You can run, but you can't hide. I'm going to burry this son of a bitch. Katherine? Kathy? Kathy! Katherine? Kat? Kat? You should be in bed, baby. Okay. Breathe. That's it. Okay. I got you. Come on. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. - I saw her. - Who did you see, baby? Who, baby? Who did you see? Katherine? Kathy? What are you doing, baby? What are you doing? Baby? What are you doing? Baby, what's going on? What do you want? What do you want? I'm trying to fucking help you! I'm trying to fucking help you! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Okay. Wait, wait for it. We're all about set and... three, two, one. Boom! You're in, dude. Use it for good, not for evil. Thanks, man. Oh, man. Thank you. Yeah. And remember, you only got 90 minutes before the whole thing just self shuts down, right? Okay? And uh, if you get busted, bro. I only came here to fix your hard drive. Comprende? Got it. You came to fix the hard drive. Sheriff Boyd. Thrill. Was it... Was it a thrill for him? My god. He's following these. He's following all of them. Visionary... Which one was visionary? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, there's... There's one more murder. Shit. Who's the sixth victim? How you feeling, baby? I feel great. What's wrong? He tortured them. All of them. It was a... a game and the sick son of a bitch is still out there. What are you going to do? Try and get the cases reopened? I don't think I can. Sheriff Stance is determined to keep a lid on it. And he fired the last two deputies and... And there still is a sixth victim. And there's no record for it. Do you think that Sheriff Stance had something to do with it? I don't know. I hadn't even thought about that. I hope that the ghosts are happy with all the hard work that you're doing. I am so proud of you. Thank you, baby. Here. Come on. Let's celebrate. Oh, fuck. He's coming. Oh, shit! Jesus. What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. Connor Lucas. Who was Connor Lucas? Is he... Is he the sixth victim? Or was he the murderer? Son of a bitch. There's a pattern. There's a pattern. Each of these crimes is completely different, but they all share one thing in common. Each fits one type of serial killer. And he covered this with meticulous detail. Like this one. This is when the killer takes something valuable from the victim. This is the only victim that had something taken from them. Look what it says. Gain. Gain. This is his signature. Each one fits a type. But this one here. This one's missing. This one's missing from the pattern. Visionary. Well, maybe he got scared, wised up, moved away. No, no, he's not scared. Look at the crime scenes. Does this guy look scared to you? Well, I can certainly run it by the Sheriff, see what he says. That's ah... I don't... I don't... That's not a good idea. What are you saying? Look, the last two deputies who went poking around were fired, okay? I don't want you lose your job. No. There's no way the sheriff would protect the killer. Yes, but he would protect himself. Okay, now you're losing me. And you got to be careful making these types of allegations. Now, if you want to get along in this town, you got to watch who you offend. Look, all I'm trying to say is that the two local murders were investigated by the sheriff and they were not investigated properly. And the two deputies who said something were fired. Then, the mayor makes this generous contribution to the sheriff's road safety campaign, and a month later, the sheriff buys a brand new home. So now the mayor is involved. No... I'm not... I'm not... Mayor, no mayor, I don't know. But the sheriff is involved. And I am... I am this close to finding the truth. Okay. I want to help. I'll look into it, see if I can find some more information on the sixth victim. Okay. Until then, let's keep this between us. - Absolutely. - Just... pump the brakes - until you hear from me, okay? - Okay. Okay. - All right. - Thank you so much. - I really appreciate it. - Hey. Good job. Sheriff, I think he's got something. What do you want from me? Remember me? I've done everything you want! What do you want from me? Remember me? Remember me? Remember me? Who did this to you? Who did this to you? You did. I didn't do it. You did. - You did. - You did. - You did. - You did. - You did. - You did. You did. Michael. Michael Lane. Hi. My name's Michael. My name's Michael Lane. Nice to meet you. I'm Michael Lane. Yeah. I just, um... I just moved here from a little town called Woodbine. It's so small, it doesn't even show up in the GPS. It's been hard to meet people. But it's given me time to work on my novel. No kidding. You're a writer too? I'd love to read your stuff. It's a date. I hope you're not getting the wrong impression of me. Just so you know, I normally don't invite guys to my place after meeting online. I could never think that about you. Actually, I haven't had much success with this whole internet dating thing. Really? A beautiful girl like you. But I have to say, it's... so refreshing to finally connect with someone. I've always felt more connected to small town people. Well, they don't get much smaller than Woodbine. We just got a McDonald's last year. Are all the guys from Woodbine as charming as you? All six of us. Well, lucky for me, one of them decided to move out here. No. Lucky for me. Where are my manners? Would you like a glass of wine? I'd love one. It's my first medieval thriller. Knight Fire. Well, the knight's the hero. Of course. I'd love your opinion. You'd be the first to read it. I'd be honored. That's okay. Red or white? Let's see. Hmm. We'll go with the white. I hate it when the red stains my coat. Oh, my God. Please don't hurt me. Almost there. Help me. Bitch. Hey, Katherine. Hi, Michael. I thought I was going to get your voicemail. No, you... you get the real thing. Look, I know you're busy and I just wanted to say that this has been the best week of my life. I can't wait to see you tomorrow. Yeah, me too. I've got big plans. Well, um, have a good night. I'll be thinking of you. Me too. Shit. Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael. Hello? Hey. I was thinking of you. That's good. Um, who am I? Um, you're Mr. Wonderful. No, I'm... I'm... I'm serious. I don't... I don't know where I am. I believe you were the last person I spoke to. I... I don't remember anything. You're serious? What's going on? Where are you? I'll be right there. Congratulations, Connor. You finally got it. You've come to the end of your story. I told you, you had it in you, but you didn't believe me. I'm coming, Lucas. Yes. And you are the visionary, Connor. Katherine is the final brush stroke in your masterpiece. That's what you intended four years ago. But better late than never, right? Shoot her! Right in the head. You're the visionary. Hurry. We don't have much time. Michael. What are you doing? Don't worry. I'll make it quick. Not like the others. No time for tittle title. She can't live! You have to finish what you started! Kill her! Kill her! You have to end it! Kill her! Kill her! Connor Lucas. It's the police. The place is surrounded. Come out with your hands up. I repeat, come out with your hands up. Kitty Kat! Kitty Kat! Target is on the move. I'm locked on target. Waiting on your command. Michael, please don't hurt me. - Michael, don't, don't, don't -Police! Open up! - Michael! No! No! - Police! Open up! Come right now Go. Go. Go. Go. No! You are a waste of skin and bone. Like to drag you behind my squad car. From downtown. Real slow, like a parade. You're a piece of shit. We had some trouble connecting the dots of these crimes from all the jurisdictions. But the puzzle pieces fit perfectly now. I've got a question for you, Connor. Yeah. Did you ever think about the families of the victims? All the time. That was half the fun. There's nothing I'd rather do than put you down like rabid dog you are. Save the county the cost of your trial. Do it. But unlike you, I don't fancy myself a judge, jury and executioner. No, you're just a pussy. You're a fucking embarrassment. You got your little brown shirt and you khaki pants, and your big shiny badge and your pistol. You can't shoot to kill. You have no idea. About the thrill. About the rush... of taking a human life. Only two people know that. Two people. God and me. You're insane. All that's left, is to flush you away forever, like the piece of shit you are. You sure about that, sheriff? Because I'm just getting started. Get him out of here. And let him rot in the hole. Haha. He got it bad for you. Good luck surviving the year. I give this dickhead two months. It's a high price on his head. He's good as dead. How much you say it is again? Call back up. Call back up. Shots fired. Shots fired. I've been shot. Back up.
