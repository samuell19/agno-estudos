How have you been doing? I got out of bed... I bathed. So the medication's helping? Guess so. Any hallucinations? No. And are you sleeping? As much as I can. I mean, I'm afraid to fall asleep. That's understandable. It's like... I'm... afraid I'm gonna to miss a call from her when she needs me. It's just so hard to let go. And what happens when you try? I can't stop seeing her face. What does she look like? Dead. And what about when she was alive? Elaine? What about it? Sing another one. Hm, that's the only song I know. How did you get your English name? Oh, my first American friend gave it to me. - Really? - Mm. I thought Barbara was a nice name. My friend liked the singer. Wait, you're named after Yentl? Who? Aye. Mom? Oh. It's okay, shh. You must believe in God. Shh. It's my fault the family broken. No, no, don't say that. Not true. He's still your father. I want you to know in your heart... this is not your fault. You didn't choose to be sick, he chose to be absent. You must believe in God. I want us to meet again, okay? Me too. Me too. Shh... shhhh. I prayed that night. God, I haven't prayed since I was a little girl. Do you believe in God? People believe in a lot of things when they're desperate. You've said that before. Well, it's true. And either way, it wasn't enough. You did take care of her. And she died. Have you heard from your father? Elaine... this is Dad. You can't keep her ashes from me just because I wasn't there. She belongs to me! Do you hear me... Mei Mei, it's Mama. I love you. Mei Mei, it's Mama. I love you. Mei Mei, it's Mama. I love you. Did he come for the ashes? No. But I'm not surprised. Four fucking years we did it alone. None of her belongs to him. Let's try something. Anything. Okay. I want you to come out here and lie down on your back. Come on, it's okay. All right... Okay, now close your eyes. Close your eyes. And breath. I want you to feel your body relaxing into the ground. Feel the full support of the ground beneath you. Now I want you to turn your attention inward. Let your body feel what deep relaxation is. Surrender. Let go... of guilt. Feel your pain and your anger, and then let it go. No judgment. No shame. Just let go. And I want you to think about these two questions. What do I need? What does my heart need to heal? Open your eyes. Sit up when you're ready. You can't keep her ashes from me. She belongs to me. Elaine? Elaine? Open your eyes. You're here, you're here. Come on, sit up. How do you feel? - I don't know. - Okay. Just breathe. Breathe, breathe. What did you experience? - I saw my dad. - Uh, huh. - I put an axe in his heart. - You did. - It was violent. - That's good. It's good, actually. It is. I don't understand. Hey, listen, you don't have to understand. You just have to trust yourself and trust your process. Am I crazy? You're gonna be okay. I promise. Elaine? Grief is long. 550... 320... 720... 950... 830 590 plus dressing is 790, 510, 435, 255. I am inspired. 620 I am awesome. 540... I am dazzling. Roasted garnet.

Spicy probiotic I am inspired. - Hey there, Ashley. - What? Sorry, I just wanted to know what you're gonna order. Oh, sorry. I am lost, what's good here? I mean, everything is delicious. Like, you cannot go wrong. I mean, I'm obsessed with this place. It's like kind of categorically my whole life. No, yeah. I mean, it's really cute or "I'm cute". Okay, I know, it's a little bit extra, but seriously just like pick anything. - You cannot go wrong. - Okay. Welcome to Cafe Abundance. Have you two been here before? Oh, I have. She hasn't. Hype. Okay, so everything here is organic, sustainably farmed, plant-based and allergy-accommodating. Our special today is "I Am Essential". House-made seitan steak with cherry compote. So do you have any questions? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The "I am dazzling" does that come with sea palm? You are. And it does not. I'm Jordan, and... - I'm sorry, I have a question. - Yeah. I was just wondering, um... what inspired the food titles? I know, right? We feel our affirmations are empowering, especially for our gals. Outside of this restaurant everybody is selling you 'You're never good enough.' That's why coming into Cafe Abundance should feel like entering an oasis of positivity. An oasis of positivity. That's right. So, I'm Jordan and I'll go to grab you some waters. Okay. I had a really big lunch so I should probably keep it light. An oasis of positivity. Excuse me, hi. Pro tip, the zucchini fries, if you have the calories to spare, get them, they're like heaven. I mean, not like the real thing of course, but they're like heaven. Oh my God, that sounds so good but I can't today... next time. (watch chimes Is everything bullshit? Kale is bullshit. Kale is definitely bullshit. But, isn't all of this bullshit? I mean, we're not happy or empowered, at least I'm not. I am just sitting here counting all of the calories in my head to see if I'm good enough for a hamburger. Oh, no, no. They don't have hamburgers here. Exactly. Look, there's nothing wrong with wanting to watch what you eat, it's called being almost 30. Okay, so having a running tally of every calorie I've eaten today like I'm some stockbroker on speed, that's normal. Oh, no, there's an app for that. Yeah, everyone does that. Yeah, I... everybody in this restaurant because it's like 80% women. Yes, yes, and we are all in this together, but girl, right now you're being a little first world problemsy and I am getting hangry. So can we please split the "I Am Grateful"? I can't even with these affirmations. Oh my God, there's nothing wrong with wanting to add a little positivity to the world. Oh no, yeah, totally, like telling women to smile. No, no, ew, gross. No, of course not just, just choose a fucking meal. Shit. You know, when I was a little girl, I remember consciously choosing not to like the color pink because it was a girl's color. I chose the color teal. I don't even know if I like teal. My whole apartment is teal. What if every decision I've ever made is ingrained with the idea that I'm, that I'm not valued? Lesser than? Fuck. I bought a juicer yesterday. Please just choose something before you start like, using your menses to fertilize your house plants. Oh, yeah, maybe I should, maybe we need to try something new. I bet you menses are great for plants. Uh, I'm sorry. Could you not talk about that here? It's lunch. Gross. Can you not tell me to save my fucking calories for zucchini fries? Because I guarantee you they are not heaven, okay. Ladies, ladies, ladies, will you just please chill the vibes down here? - Ashley. - Oh, I am not chilling shit. Just please calm down. This is a safe space. This is not a safe space. This is the same bullshit being sold to women everywhere. Ma'am, I feel bad about my body too, sometimes. I go to the gym. I cut, I bulk. So, I totes get feminism. Uh. Well, as long as you totes get it. But see, I don't think that you can because you go to the gym to build your body for you. I chip away at mine to fit into this world, but you know what? - Fuck it. - Ma'am, you need to sit down. Oh no, I am done picking up scraps of self-esteem. I am awesome! I am beautiful! I'm great! I'm grateful! I am wise! I'm sparkley! I'm bold! I'm inspired! I am... I am... half naked! Oh, oh. Oh, are you uncomfortable? Feel a little weird, huh? Oh, you thought feminism was cool, right? You can price, package, wrap into a fucking bow and sell it back to me as confidence? Well, listen up. I'm not hiding. I'm not backing down. I am America's greatest threat because I'm a woman who isn't buying. I'm not buying this. I'm not buying your bullshit. I'm not buying anything. I am investing in me and I'm ready to take up some motherfucking space! No. We are so scary, man. You guys got to go. - Okay, yeah. - Okay, whatever. Fine! You know, what? Fuck this restaurant concept! Punk! Uh, the adrenaline just wore off. Yeah, my tits really hurt. This sucks. Maybe we should find your car. It's somewhere over there. Are you getting hungry? Fuck, I'm hungry. Wanna get some burgers? Let's get some fucking burgers. Oh, no. - What have you done? - Nothing, nothing, nothing. Please. No, no, no, no. Stop it! - Hey. - No. Stop - Shh. - Get off me! - Stop it. - Get off me! Stop. What do you want from me? I want you to do what I say... okay? No. I guess I have to... board every window this house. Come on. No, please, no, please. We can't go on like this. Please, please. - Open your mouth, Grace. - No. Open your mouth, come on. Don't! I don't want it. No, no. Please. Come on, come on.

His mom and I talk on the phone every night before bed even though we've never met.
