Um, well, I thought about what you told me earlier. And I went to look for some jobs. Baby, I got this. You know I was just fucking with you. Yeah, but I actually really enjoy the idea of bringing in some extra money to the house. And you know, with the baby coming soon... We can actually really use it. You know old man Johnson said, if I come up with 200,000, the pharmacy mine. Yours? Yeah. He said he trying to let it go. And I don't know how I'm going to come up with it. But I know I want that shit So. 200,000. And the pharmacy is yours. For real. Ours. - Yeah. - Ours. Yeah and I figured, Since we been doing all this healthy eating shit, we can kind of introduce it to the business. That's a good idea. Baby, I'm saying, people coming in and out everyday picking up their meds, and they ain't getting no better. We can give them a way out. Like take the holistic route. In the pharmacy? Yeah, we can introduce them to some herbals. Help them with their situation. Get em off that synthetic shit. Just like what we eating right now. You see zucchini. But I see vitamin A. And vitamin A can prevent a whole lot of shit that these "doctors" can't cure. How do you know all this shit? 'Cause I'm smart. Mm-hmm. You are very smart. Smart enough to have you. You ready for that dessert? Dessert. I'm ready for my dessert right now. Me too. Don't sit back down. Nah, don't sit back down. This is over here. I'm telling you, girl, I'm having dessert uncooked. Yes, yes. Hey man, you trying to get shot? Nah, man. What's happening bruh? Not shit, man. What's up? Alright, this the move. Big Man, he got some shit coming in real soon. From this Latino nigga name Poppy. Poppy? I know Poppy? He ain't shit to play with, though. Hell, nah. I saw him and his shooter today at the club. Them niggas look dumb crazy. So how are we going to play this? Alright, see, this the move. Me and Big Man supposed to be cool so he ain't gone' know I'm coming for him. But what I need you to do is your detective shit, get the work up off of him. You know how you cop ass niggas do, give them two options. Go to jail or go home. You already know the play. Alright. Fifty-fifty split? Nigga naw. I'm doing all the work. Seventy-thirty. But you can't hit a lick without me. Sixty-forty. Sixty-forty. Sixty-forty? I guess man. Alright, I'mma be waiting on the word.

My pops was a cop. His pops was a cop. And his pops was one of the first black officers. I'm like fourth generation police officers. Wow. I didn't know that. See me, I never wanted to be a cop. Let alone be in love with one. Being a cop used to mean something. You can make a difference in your community. But now, all we got is all these senseless killings. I mean, it don't feel right. Not like it was when we first started. The only way to make a change is from the inside, got it? The inside. That's why I joined the police officers. Okay? That's why I became a cop.
