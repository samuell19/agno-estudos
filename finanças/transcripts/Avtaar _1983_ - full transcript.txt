'Praise and disgrace are the result of your own deeds.' 'Your shadow will always follow you.' "Days, months and... ...years will pass" "But my love will.." "...never ebb" "...never ebb" Abdul! Start the car. [CAR STARTING ENGINE] You're terrific! It's not the flush of youth that works here. But of experience. Guy's a wizard! Forget touching any car, he goes close and they sway like lovers! You are right, friend. - Good day sir. - Good day. - Good news for you. - Good news? Your overtime for today is sure. he is Sitaram. He's Laxminarayan's driver. Their car is not working. Go with him to their house. You'll get the price you quote. I won't work overtime today. What? You're the king of overtime. And you're refusing a party. Are you feeling well? I sell my time every day. But I've kept this evening for myself. I want to live for myself. Excuse me for today. I'll be there in the morning. Okay! Radha. Congratulations on our 25 years of marriage. To you too. What's in this? What are you doing? The children are watching. Children? - Where's everybody? - Gone for a film. Film? So only the two of us are at home? This auspicious day.... And this solitude. Good God you are great! - What are you looking at? - The lines of your destiny. ....which have grown dull thanks to mundane household chores. They are more deeply etched. My destiny is shining on your forehead. 25 years have gone by. But it feels like yesterday. "Day, months and years.... ....will pass.... ....but my love will never ebb" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" "Day, months and years will pass.... ....but my love will never ebb" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" "Day, months and years will pass.... ....but my love will never ebb" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" "Day, months and years will pass" "Know one thing that I consider you as God..." "Know one thing that I consider you as God..." "....I don't know anything other than this" "You have to know what to tell and what not to" "Now you know it" "I'll do whatever you tell" "But my love will never ebb" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!" - "We'll see that. - Sure, do so!"

[GUNSHOTS] Rascal! Scoundrel! Despite so many warnings, you haven't learnt a lesson! - Daddy. - Shut up! He has forgotten his position because you encourage him! A pauper mechanic. Who looks at our cars for his bread. He dare do this! Rascal! Do you know the consequences of playing with my reputation? I will wipe you out completely! Come! [SEASHORE] Open the door! Sir.... ....where is my Radha? I've come to take her. Don't be foolish. Talk sense. You can write your own destiny if you wish. I haven't understood. Come with me. Money can buy every feeling, every moment of life. This little scrap of paper can buy humans not Just love. It's a blank cheque. Fill whatever you desire. Can I fill in whatever I wish? Yes, whatever you desire. Jugal Kishore's cheque is never dishonoured. Here. Sir, honour your cheque. Scoundrel! How dare you? You said I could write whatever I desired. Honour your cheque now! Give me my Radha! Veeru. Throw this dog out of the house! Radha! You.... You've come here? I've left everything and come to you! I've come home. I've come to my own house! [BIRD CHIRPING] You serve me like a devotee. Silly boy, people don't give so much respect to God these days! You are my God. What was our relationship? I was an orphan. In this crowd of unknown faces, you held my hand. Or I'd be lost long ago. If I can spend my life at these feet, who can be luckier than me? Me! Sewak.... ....God knows what relation we share. Father. Get my towel. - [BIRD CHIRPING] Mother, make cauliflower stuffed pancakes today. - I'll have brunch not breakfast before I leave for college. - Okay. Towel. - Sewak. - Yes mistress? - Put some oil in the stove. - Okay. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Ramesh. Daughter-in-law! Are you still sleeping? [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Get my sari from the laundry. - Sure. - Good morning. - Live long. - Sewak. - Coming! - What is it? - Iron these quickly. I only see Sewak in this house. he too has limited horse power like any car. If you put too much load, it will suffer a breakdown. If he is laid up in bed, nobody will get anything done! That is why I sleep on the floor not on the cot! - Chander. - Yes. How was the movie last night? Very good till the interval! After that she fell flat. Fell flat? That's where the directors of today lose out. Take this! In these times of inflation, I somehow buy almonds for you. And you give them to the boys! It's their time to eat almonds not mine! Open your mouth! Eat this. - Ramesh. - Yes. - When is your Job interview? - At 11 this morning. My blessings are with you. God will give you success. Thank you. Let's go. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Found anything? Mr.... Avtaar Kishen. It packs up every other day. I've checked it out and understood the problem. - Hi, Daddy. Very good morning to you. - Good morning, dear. Come. Let's have some breakfast. Have breakfast alone. I'm very late for college. - Get the car out. - Your car is ready. Wow! My car is ready. That's nice. Thank you very much, mechanic. No need to thank me. It's my duty. [MUSIC ON RADIO] [BIRD CHIRPING] Hello Chander. What's wrong with my sleep that it keeps me awake? And your memory that never goes away! "Betel from Banaras, Pune, Mandwa or Bengal," "Which one will you have?" "Apply some more lime" Here you are. [GRUNTS] Good day brother. Good day. Add it to my account. I certainly will. - Good day to you. - Good day Rashid! Quickly give me some betel leaf. Where are you these days? You're like the elusive moon! Even forgotten your friends! I can forget myself not you! As regards meeting you, I have no time to breathe! No point hiding from you. Remember my son, Anwar? [HORN HONK] - The one who is abroad? - Yes. He hardly writes letters but sends draft after draft! 2000, 5000, 10000! Meaning you're having a ball daily! That is fine. May the Lord grant him more prosperity! But my life is miserable! So much of running around! Bank accounts, household expenses, house rent, groceries.... Everything is on my head! - And your daughter-in-law? - She's one of God's creations! She won't spend a penny without asking me! If she goes shopping, it's with me! If she wants to go out, it's with me! You'll be shocked to hear this. Even her Jewelry is of my choice! By the grace of God, I've got a good daughter-in-law! What else do you need? Your old age is great! You maybe old! I am still young! I was passing by the confectioner's he was frying piping hot sweetmeats. My mouth watered, so I bought the whole lot. Everybody start! - What's in this? - Just a minute. This is for my daughter-in-law. Thank you, father. - This is for Ramesh. - And me? Be patient. This pant piece is for you And this shirt piece for Sewak. Thank you. And this is for my only wife. At least say thanks. - Where's yours? - That's a surprise. When I wear it on Diwali, people will watch agape. Dad, these are great! Let's have tea. [HORN HONK] - Chander.... - So you'll wear this for Diwali? I wait for your new clothes. Get something for yourself too. I spend the day in uniform and night in a night suit. It's their time. They go places. They are Avtaar Kishen's sons not some nincompoop's! Mother! Mother! Dad! I've got a Job! Congratulations! Congratulations, brother! - When do you Join? - On the first. But we'll have to pay 5000 rupees as security deposit within 2 days. Five thousand rupees! Where will we get so much money? Why do you worry? God is with us. Everything will work out fine. Everything will work out fine. Good day! how did you come by today? [BIRD CHIRPING] - I have some work. - Command your slave. I need 5000 rupees. Ramesh has got a Job. he has to pay security deposit. - By which date? - Tomorrow. Rustom has gone to Ahmedabad. I'll return it soon as he comes. You're a little late. By God, 10000 rupees were lying in the house. Then Amjadbhai came, my brother-in-law.... ....he needed it so I gave it. [BIRD CHIRPING] This is very difficult. Look there's only one solution. I'll go to Amjad and get the money back. Let him arrange from elsewhere. But your Job must be done! No way! he's your relative. Don't worry about me. Lord will make some arrangements for me. Okay, I'll take leave. [HORN HONK] At least have tea. Some other time. Good bye. Oh Lord! Dad! - What is it daughter-in-law? - What is this you've picked up? Vegetables that resemble you! And that mince....! how often have I told you to get fine mince! The mince is quite fine. Is that fine? God what a shame! While eating eye sight is sharp but weakens when buying groceries! You do one odd Job but ruin 10 others! Where are you going? One rupee is short in the account. I got some betel leaf and tobacco for myself. Lord bless us! he's got the world's vices! What expenses you pile up! I'm fed up! Your son is sitting cool in Dubai. And tied this pain round my neck! [CRICKET CHIRPING] I'm so stupid! I forgot to tell you the good news. - Good news? - I've got a whole month's leave. Start preparations. First we'll go to Shimla. Then Red Fort in Delhi, Taj Mahal in Agra and Charminar in Hyderabad! I've been watching them from here. Whenever you need something, you take me on a tour of India! What is it? Actually.... Give me these bangles. - Bangles? - Yes, I'll return them in a month. No, I won't give these. - Listen.... - Absolutely not! These are mother's bangles. Ramesh too is our child. Silly woman! For whom do I need this? Remember his condition? That little baby was almost breathing his last. How terrifying that night was! Doctor. I am sorry. I can do nothing. No. This can't be true! My baby! You can't leave me! Do anything but save my child! If anything happens to him, I'll never forgive you! What haven't I done? Consulted doctors, physicians. I went everywhere. Where do I go now? - Knock at mother's door. - Mother's door? Knock at Vaishnodevi's door. Take him to her refuge without eating or drinking anything. Nobody returned disheartened from her temple.

I am confident you will do your duty with honesty and dedication. I will try my best, sir. - Carry on. - Thank you, sir. Dear friend, my landlord. here's the rent for this month. The same 80 bucks for the past 15 years! Neither can I throw you out of the house nor from my heart! Why don't you buy this house? - Buy it? - Yes. - Why do you pull my leg? - No Jokes. I'll sell it dirt cheap. Give me 30000 and become a landlord. I was born a landlord. The country was divided. Land got left behind and the lord came here. Now I have but one desire. To make Radha a landlady. God willing! The moment I win a lottery, I'll come over with the cash. Till then my friend, make do with the rent. [CHUCKLES] Good day. Goodbye, sister-in-law! [BIRD CHIRPING] [HORN HONK] Whose telegram is it? From him. he is coming. Anwar is coming? When? - Around Eid. - Good gracious! I'll see my son after a whole year! First see the condition of the house! What will he say? Stains on the walls and cobwebs hanging too! Don't worry. I'll get a labourer. You want an excuse to splurge! A two room house and you can't clean it! By God you eat like a horse! Get a broom not a labourer! Why are you standing? If the mill closes, you'll have to sleep hungry! As if she feeds me a proper meal! [GIRL CHUCKLES] - Hi, dad. - Hi. - Hello, father! - Seeing you after very long. He's always studying. Brilliant boy! Sit! I've often told you to introduce us to your family. In a day or two. You always say this. Scold him hard Dad. Meeting each other will strengthen bonds. Now go home and tell your Dad.... ....that he and his family will eat dinner with us tomorrow. This is my request and order too! Understand? Come! [MUTED AUDIO] This is my mother. - Greetings! - Bless you! That is my Dad. And she is Laxminarayan's only daughter. - How is sir? - He is fine. My Dad told Chander and Chander told me. And I'm telling you, my Dad has invited all of you for dinner. Tell Renu to tell her Dad.... ....Avtaar Kishen said to tell her Dad.... ....that he will come with his family for dinner tomorrow night! - The meal was delicious. - Sit. The effort with which you've educated your sons and made them capable.... It's really your courage. You may call it courage. You may call it duty. But I call it love. I appreciate this love. You've done a lot. Now let me do something. I want to take over all of Chandar's responsibilities. His management course. Training, business. Leave it all to me. Assume you're free from his side. I haven't understood. I don't see any difference between a son and son-in-law. Renu is my only child. Chander can stay here and look after my house, business, everything. So you want to make him a house husband? I want to make his future. Thank you very much sir. Chander's father is alive as yet. What are you saying? Avtaar Kishen lives by his own efforts. Your wealth can never wield power over his poverty. In your false pride, you're losing a good opportunity. You'll regret it someday. Sir, it's the needy who regrets! Avtaar Kishen. The one you want to buy with wealth, has this written on his forehead.... 'Not for sale.' Money can buy everything. But I'll never sell my wealth! Father! Understand one thing clearly. Renu will come to my house as my daughter-in-law. My son won't stay here as a house husband! Goodbye! Yes, I know wealth is great. But relations and feelings that aren't sold in the market are greater! Laxminarayan must be thinking what a man he has encountered! But you did speak a lot. In a way you insulted him. Insult? Whatever it be, he is a big man. A big man is one who doesn't consider others small. You're still a child. The fangs of these wolves are hidden. As regards your love, look at your mother. Her Dad could buy 10 Laxminarayans! But she left everything and came to me If Renu's love is true, she too will come. Now all that remains is your studies. Leave that to me. What is 15000 rupees? I'll work night and day, slog my guts out but you'll do the course! First I trust the Lord. Then this hand of mine! From where did you get this Junk? From the Junkyard of my destiny! What will you do with it? I've got Ramesh fixed up with a Job. Now I'm only worried about Chander. he wants to do a course and I will see that it is done! This will be the last test of my life. But son, every bone in this is broken! I'll fix its' bones with my sweat. I'll put life into it. And sell it as brand new. Just be kind enough to give me some space in your garage. I'll do your work during the day and mine at night. Who has stopped you? Go right ahead! [METAL HITS] [STARTING ENGINE] Take him to the hospital! Fast! My hand! What has happened to my hand? - Doctor.... - I am sorry.... ....this hand will have no sensation. No. Good God! What has happened! Who has cast an evil eye on us? Our own. I used to work a lot. Now I've got a break. Don't cry silly woman. So what if I've lost an arm? I have two arms left. Ramesh and Chander! With them around, why should we worry? Don't cry. Be brave. This watch is for you. Perfumes. - Saris. - Nothing for my sister? - I've bought 2 saris for her. - And my brother? This suit length for him. For whom is this? I bought this for Dad. Good you did that. he will be pleased. If not you who else will bring for him? Anwar. Anwar. Where are you son? have some sweets. I'd asked God to send you. I'm really relieved you came. After ages, I'm at peace. Found peace? So long you were sleeping on thorns! Walking on fire! I swear, complain to your son about me! Tell him I wouldn't feed you! Made you work like a slave day and night! - Tell him. - Yes! Yes! You are right! You've made me a servant! Since the day you left, this woman has made my life hell! Both father and son slaughter me! Let your heart be at peace! God is witness that I considered him more than my own Dad! But what did I get in return? What are you watching? Throw me out by my hair! Dad this poor thing serves you night and day. And you are maligning her? It's very sad. I didn't expect this from you. Come, Zubeida. Rice pudding. I love it. - Avtaar Kishen! - Welcome, sir! - Greetings! - Greetings! Greetings! - How are you? - Everything is fine. [CHUCKLES] Son, you left the garage and the life went out of it. Sir! People leave the world but the world still gets by. But how did you come by? Good news for you. Good news. 15000 from your provident fund. You met with an accident during working hours. Compensation for that 20000. And your Junk car.... ....that you repaired and dressed up I even sold that for 20000. - Really? - That accounts for 55000. Mr. Mehta, give him the money. Take it. - Is this all mine? - Yes, yours. Mother, I may forget you but you don't forget me for a moment. You made all my dreams come true in one flash! You've made me so rich.... ...that there's no worry of the future! Didn't I say I would see that you did the course? Take this and catch hold of Khan uncle today itself. And get the papers made for the house. The house should be registered in your mother's name, not mine. Congratulations! Today you have become a landlady! I won't let this Joy go unnoticed. I'll celebrate it grandly! "Lord..." "Lord..." "Lord..." "Lord..." "Lord, you are too good!" "Lord, you are too good!" "You keep giving!" "Lord, you are too good!" "You keep giving!" "Your benevolence is endless" "Lord, you are too good!"

"You keep giving!" "O Lord..." "What can I say about your glory..." "....you've given me so much money in my bad days?" "What can I say about your glory..." "....you've given me so much money in my bad days?" "You gave me encouragement and the fruits of my labour" "Good and bad days are the two sides of a coin" "Good and bad days are the two sides of a coin" "In a garden of blooms..." ......there are thorns also along with roses" "Lord, you are too good!" "You keep giving!" "Your benevolence is endless" "Lord, you are too good!" "You keep giving!" "O Lord..." "O Lord..." Come on. Okay kids begin. "Let's go, the Goddess' call has come" How time flies. We took Ramesh when he was tiny to the Mother Goddess' temple. And today he is 25 years old. But you didn't let me fulfil my promise. You were involved in your own running around. Now there's no running around, Just time to while away. We can leave whenever you wish. - Ramesh. - Yes, father? [BIRD CHIRPING] On this Ashtami day, your mother wishes to go on a pilgrimage. Looks like Mother has called her. Today is Saturday. Get 2 tickets of the Super fast for Monday. Okay, father! "Glories to the Goddess!" "Let's go, call has come" Despite what you say, I won't give you a penny. If they are fond of loafing, let them arrange it themselves. Ramesh, how is this set? It has Just come today. It is beautiful. Keep this coat for sir. It will be very cold there. You are always worried about him. Ramesh.... What time is the train? - I .... - What is it? - I couldn't get the tickets. - Why? I couldn't arrange money. You couldn't arrange for the money? Yes mother I tried a lot. I asked the bank for advance but I didn't get it. We didn't want thousands! You know Chander is studying. Dad too is out of work. The house is running only on my salary. Why don't you go on the pilgrimage next year? By then I'll arrange something. He is right. We'll go next year. No. Once you've thought about it you must definitely go. By the grace of your kindness, I've saved some money in the post office. Rupees 500. I'll get that. Sewak. My child! You're offering this.... Our pilgrimage has been successful. - Mistress! - My child! - Hello! - Hello, Mr. Rashid! - Hello Uncle! - Bless you, son! - All fine? - Absolutely. Uncle.... [HORN HONK] If you could open a little account with 10000 rupees in my bank.... Why didn't you say so earlier? Anyway no problem. It will be done. I don't need to take permission. - Thank you! Bye. - Bye. - Is the betel leaf ready? - Sure but I won't give it. All right. Let's hear it. Who belongs to whom? It's all fate. When a dear one thinks of us, a pain is close to the heart. Amazing! This reminds me of one. Goes like this.... Yes, please. What does beauty know? What does love understand? What does beauty know? What does love understand? The world lies at the feet of us who lick the dust! - Beautifully spoken! - Thank you. - Goodbye! - See you! - Radha, where are you? - What's wrong? I'm here. What Joy is it that you can't even see me? - Chander has got through! - Chander got through! After all whose son is he? Radha-Kishen's! But where is he? Daddy! Daddy! By the grace of your blessings I have got through! This is no great news for me. This is the beginning of your success. It's my heartfelt desire to send you to America for higher studies. America! But you won't go alone. Renu will go with you. Every Joy of life will be at your feet. Studies and honeymoon, both together. I can never forget your obligations. Young man, one has to lose something in order to gain something. What? The need of today has reduced the importance of relations. Nobody thinks about anybody else. Man has to think for himself. I haven't understood. It's plain and simple. On one hand you have status, position, future. And on the other side is your family. You can choose whichever one you want. The choice is yours. What? You will leave home? Mother every man has the right to think for himself. What is wrong if I think for myself? I'm making my future. But.... you are our future, son. We raised you with our blood and sweat Made you capable enough to be noticed by others. And you will leave us? Is this how you repay your Dad for his sacrifices? Sacrifices? What have you done for me? Educated me? Paid my school and college fees? This is the duty of every parent! That is what you have done What else have you done? What are you saying? I am right, mother. What do you want? Should I let this opportunity go? Don't weigh your parents' love with wealth son. Love! Wealth is even bigger. You left everything and came here. What did you get in return? Stove, grinding stone, smoke! Your hair has turned gray doing the dishes! You spent your whole life in Just 2 pairs of clothes! - Shut up! - No, Radha. No, Radha. He is right. What have we done? We have done what every parent does for their children. Chander! Chander! Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha! Mr. Avtaar Kishen? A father has come to your door as a beggar not Avtaar Kishen. What are you saying? You seem somewhat upset. Tell me how I can help you. Have mercy on this poor man and give my son back to me. Say whatever you have to Chander. I don't want to come between father and son. You are already between us. I'm not one of those rich men whose wealth lies in banks and lockers My wealth is my children. You locked that up in your vault. Avtaar Kishen! I faced mountains of difficulties but never lost courage. But today the sorrow of a child broke my back! I suffered, lived in abject misery but I never stretched out my hand! Today I put out my hand before you. Put my earnings of 22 years in my lap as charity! I'll be eternally obliged. Don't accuse me unjustly. I haven't tied up your son. You've come here of your own will. I haven't forced you. You may leave with your Dad if you wish! Come home son. I've come to take you. I won't go back to that hell! Have pity for your mother, if not me. Come and see how she pines for you. For me both my parents are dead! Chander! No. No. [HORN HONK] [CRICKET CHIRPING] Ramesh has closed your account. He said if I give you cigarette.... ....I must take the money from you. You went out and the mistress fell very ill. - What happened? - She fainted all of a sudden. I called the doctor. He gave an injection. Now she's better. Radha.... - Now how are you? - Did you go for the wedding? Yes, I did. Why didn't you come for the wedding? Everybody was waiting for you. Mr. Laxminarayan has sent these for both of you. Sewak! What happened? Who broke the lock to my room? - I broke it. - Why? The mistress suddenly fell ill. Nobody else was at home. - There was no money at home.... - So you broke the lock for money? You worthless boy! how dare you! You have pampered him too much! Today he stole money. Tomorrow he may steal ornaments! He has not stolen anything. What is breaking a lock to take money if not theft? I have taken 50 rupees of yours. I'll take it out from my savings and replace it by morning. Stay in your place, rascal! Daughter-in-law! Why did you stop? Hit me! He lifted his hand on his daughter-in-law for a servant! - Is this the respect we get? - Please forgive Sewak. Whatever he did was for me. As if you were so sick? We were on our way. You wouldn't have died in that time! Ramesh.... Once the peace of the house is lost, it will only worsen. Now you earn your living so make arrangements to live elsewhere. Why? I want you as well as us to live in peace. That is why vacate this house as soon as possible. Vacate the house? Who are you to throw us out? The owner of this house! I am the owner of this house not you! What is she saying? Father, I got the house registered.... ....in her name not mother's. [THUNDER CLAP] Well done son! You've done very well. One son stabbed in the chest the other in the back! How does it matter whose name the house is in? You can stay here as long as you wish. I don't want to die before my death! In fact I want to live even after I die! Let's go Radha. Let's go. I only have 500 rupees now. I swear by God I'll pay the remaining 200 very soon. Do you think sir is running a charity? First bring the full amount Then you'll get the key to the room Sir, my parents have no roof over their head. Have mercy on me. Give him the key. Thank you very much sir. I can never forget your obligation. [HORN HONK] What are you thinking of? What is left to think about? I don't understand what will happen So what if our kids deceived us... My experience will never let me down. I am a skilled worker. Once I get the tools.... I will write my own destiny. But where will you get the tools? That's what I'm thinking of. No! No Radha! I'm already indebted to you. These things come handy in bad times. A woman's bad time starts when her husband is no more. I am alive! I'm alive. Don't you worry. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. [HORN HONK] Next. Your name? Bahadur Singh. Got in the line again! No, I've Just come. You've already donated once and you say you've Just come! Throw him out! What's the matter? Why are you beating him? For them selling blood is business! he drinks and gambles with the money! What's this child? Sir, I.... Sir! See what I've brought! Sewak.... Where did you get these from? I.... Did you steal? - No, I didn't steal. - Then where did you get money? I asked where did you get the money? I met Chander. Sewak! You've begged that rascal, Chander for charity! Get out of my sight! No Avtaar! He didn't ask Chander for money. He is lying. Look at this! And this! Not once, this poor boy sold his blood twice to buy these! Forgive me. Forgive me my son. Sewak! Why didn't you take birth from my womb? - Mistress! - Sewak.

Dad, I've been searching for you. Finally I found you today. Why all this? For what? Mother, why does Dad need to work when we are here? You'll stay in a hut when we are alive! I can't tolerate this! Instead say, you can't bear to see this hut near your friends' palace? And you can't bear to see a crippled man in the hut because he's your Dad! A dirty stain on the pristine sheet of your honour! - What are you saying? - The truth! You're scared to see us. What will people say? Mr. Laxminarayan's son-in-law is the son of this shabby man? Who is sitting on the footpath with a screw driver and plier! That's not right Dad. It is! Take your fraud face away from here! I've seen its' ugliness. Go away! [VEHICLE START ENGINE] - 50 rupees, please. - What? I've stopped working for free! [ENGINE SOUND] Radha! Sewak! - I've reached my aim! - Really! I've achieved what I wanted! I've achieved what I wanted! By inventing this new carburetor.... Avtaar has solved the petrol problem to quite an extent. A car that ran 10 kilometers on 1 liter of petrol.... .... runs for 15 kilometers with this new carburetor. It is a great achievement. Congratulating you on this invention... We approve of your carburetor. And recommend it for registration. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, sir. [MUTED AUDIO] [BIRD CHIRPING] [CAR DOOR CLOSED] Radha. Wishes on our wedding anniversary. You too. I'm very happy to see happiness on your face after years. The greatest happiness is.... ....with every passing year, our love too is growing old. See what I've brought for you. Bangles! My gold bangles! I thought there would be diamonds and pearls in this. But I never imagined you would give me such a precious gift! Time had stolen this. Today I stole it back from time! Silly woman! This is your principal. I have to pay the interest. On every curve in life, you have given me something. You never asked for anything. The need never arose. When the time comes, I'll ask. I'll wait for that time. But now dinner is waiting for you. - Sewak. - Yes? Is the order for Universal Trading Company ready? They are working double shift. It will be completed in 2 days. And what about the complain about the radiator? We've asked for the damaged ones to be sent back. And we've replaced them with new ones. At least eat dinner in peace. I am eating peacefully. Sewak, what about Mr. Kapoor's.... That's enough. God has given us much more than we had desired. Now take it easy. Even the government retires men at 55. Man should retire the day his call comes from above. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Beautiful, Sudha. Your taste is exquisite. You've decorated the house so well it can't be recognised. Now we need 2 things. A video and a car. They too will come. - Sir dinner is laid. - Come on. Please come. - Take a seat. - Come. Take. Start eating! Mr. Ramesh. Excuse me. Welcome. What happened to our installment? It will come to you this month. Every month you put me off with promises. And use our refrigerator, television and furniture. - This is not right. - We had some unforeseen expenses. I don't like to repeat myself. You are the son of a wealthy man. It doesn't speak well of you. Don't worry, Mr. Taneja. You won't have reason to complain henceforth. Okay! Dinner is turning cold. Sir Gopal has come. Greetings, sir! Gopal.... I am sorry that you lost a leg while working in my factory. If one part is damaged, the entire machinery is ruined. I've experienced this. And so I can sympathise with you. That you say this is enough for me. You will get your dues from the company. From my side.... I give you 30000. Thirty thousand! Are these mine master? Did you see children how generous my master is? What a generous heart he has! he has made a cripple man wealthy! This money will be useful in bad times Keep them carefully. No Gopal! Don't make this mistake! Don't ruin your life yourself! This world is very cruel, unmerciful! They will cut off your other leg too! This crutch is more dependable compared to blood relations! Sorry Gopal. I have no right to interfere in your personal matters. Forgive me. I want it done at once. But sir our products are much more superior to theirs. Why do we need to sell them cheap? We will suffer losses. Sharma.... What you consider a loss, is the biggest profit of my life. Wipe out Laxmi Enterprise and Chander International from the market At whatever cost! Yes, daddy. Why are our orders getting cancelled? Ball-bearings, pistol-rings, clutch plates. They were in demand till yesterday Why aren't they being sold today? That.... What's the matter? Our competitor, Avtaar Enterprises is selling its' products very low. "Kashi, Kolkatta and Patna rock" "When you dance, the whole world rocks" [HORN HONK] [CAR DOOR CLOSED] - Good day sir! - Don't abuse our friendship. One doesn't make fun of friends. Not this, my brand. Write it in my account. You are great. You haven't changed one bit. We always talked about you. Neither have I forgotten. I missed you badly today. So I came to meet you. [GROAN] [BIRD CHIRPING] - What are you doing? - Washing grandpa's clothes. - Grandpa's clothes? - Yes, he is unwell. So what if he's unwell? You'll wash his dirt? Get up! Stupid! You're washing his dirty clothes! But you make him wash your dirty clothes. Shameless! [BABY CRYING] Daughter-in-law, aren't you ashamed to hit the child? You should be ashamed! You made him wash your dirt! Tomorrow you'll make him beg and steal! I won't let his horrible shadow fall on my child! I swear by God, either I will stay in this house or him! Come inside! Dad, this is too much! Let us live in peace. For God's sake go somewhere else.... Anwar.... Where can I go son? I have nobody in this world but for you. Don't throw me out of the house. I did everything for this house. Washed clothes and dishes. Swept and swapped. Stayed hungry, listened to your wife's abuses! But I never let the world hear about our family problems. I kept up this false appearance. Don't throw me out son! Tomorrow if I wander in the streets nobody will say this is Rashid. Everybody will say, this is Anwar's father! Don't take the family honour on to the streets my son. Anwar.... Whenever you take me out of this house.... ....take me out on your shoulders. Avtaar. I had fallen in my eyes. Today I fell in your eyes too! Everything is in the open! Eat something. No, I can't eat. Rashid, have a bite or two. No. I'm not hungry at all. It won't go down my throat. - Eat one morsel. - No. For the sake of my friendship. God knows how many Avtaar Kishens exist on this earth! How many Rashids! This is a problem. An issue. A problem, an issue! Friends this is not an orphanage or an inn. This is our house, yours and mine. It's a place of relations based on feelings. It's for those who are alone despite being crowded by relatives. This house is not for those whom society has shunned. But those shunned by their own! What is this injustice that after life long hard work and experience... People retire and are thrown away like useless, discarded parts. The oil is present but the lamp is extinguished! We will light these lamps again! Muster up your courage. Create the desire to live. And proceed forward. Friends, get up, walk and run. Don't give up living before you die! [PEOPLE APPLAUSE] "Friends..." "Friends..." "Friends, get up and run..." "Friends, get up and run..." "....don't stop living before death" "Friends..." "Friends..." "Friends, get up and run..." "Friends, get up and run..." "....don't stop living before death" "Friends..." "We are no less than these youngsters" "We are no less than these youngsters" "We are not dependent on them" "We are not dependent on them" "So, shatter their illusion" "Friends..." "Friends, get up and run..." "....don't stop living before death" "Friends..." "Why are sitting so listlessly?" "Why are sitting so listlessly?" "You are such an experienced man" "You are such an experienced man" "Play your innings; don't run away from the field" "Friends..." "Friends, get up and run..." "....don't stop living before death" "Friends..." "We've made the decision..." "We've made the decision..." "....not to give in" "Not to give in" "Not to give in" "Live respectfully not on their crumbs" "Friends..." "Friends, get up and run..." "Friends, get up and run..." "....don't stop living before death" "Friends..." No problem. You can call everybody. But how did this happen? I don't understand a thing. What's the matter? Nobody is seen in the factory. All the workers have left. Left work? Why? They have been employed at double the salary elsewhere. Double the salary! Who is paying them double? Dad. Why is he out to ruin us? After all what does he want? Yes. No, that's not the case. I'll be there at sharp 4. Bye. Good day sir. - Miss Amy. - Yes, sir? Why do you send anybody without an appointment to me? Don't you recognise me? Mr. Laxminarayan, how can I ever forget you? You seem upset. So how can I help you? You've taken away everything from me! You've erased my name from the market You gave me such a kick in business, that it broke my back! Somebody's profit, somebody's loss. Somebody's loss is somebody's gain. This is the world! Today you had my factory shut down. You grabbed all my workers, my talent. Talent? Once you too had snatched somebody's talent! Laxminarayan! I will be ruined Dad. My blood and sweat too is mingled in that business. At least think of my future. I have no interest in anyone's future! Mr. Chander Kishen.... ....today every man has the right to think for himself. If I think about myself, what's wrong with it? Don't waste my time. You may go. After every kind of inquiry, it has been proved.... ...that Ramesh has misappropriated 50000 rupees belonging to the bank! This is wrong. I did nothing. I did not misappropriate funds. I am innocent! That will be decided by the court. You are under arrest, Mr. Ramesh. Sir. Tukaram. Sir. Daughter-in-law! You and here? Mother, I am ruined! A mountain of difficulties fell on us! The bank people acted mean with us. They accused my husband of misappropriation and had him arrested. What? Ramesh arrested! Did you hear? I am listening. What's surprising about it? He is innocent. He has been framed. Save him father! Or he will be imprisoned! We will be destroyed! Nobody supports criminals. You've come to the wrong door. Mother, please do something. Pay the bail and save your son. Come with me. Radha.... You won't pay the bail. I bind you by oath! [WOMAN CRYING] Sir.... This is between you and me. Don't worry, I will pay bail for Ramesh tomorrow morning. What is the need for money? There is need. I don't trust Ramesh at all. And I'm not paying this bail for Ramesh but for the sake of Radha. I can't bear to see my life cry. Release Ramesh Kishen. - Okay, sir. Thank you, inspector. - It is alright. Sir.... We are obliged to you for paying the bail. We can't forget it all our lives. Strangers are better than family. You are an angel. I've done nothing son. It's all God's doing. Come, let's go. Come. Is Rashid Anwar at home? - he doesn't live here. - Then where does he live? - What's the matter? - He has won the Provident Fund case. That had been going on for 5 years. His draft for 37500 rupees is with me. 37500! Why are you standing outside? Please come inside. - Did you hear? - What's the matter? - Remember Dad's case? About Provident Fund? - Yes. He won the case! Lord Almighty has answered our prayers! Brother don't feel offended. Somebody keeps coming to pester Dad so I said he doesn't live here. Then call him. God! he's Just had lunch and gone out - he'll return by evening. - Okay, I'll come later. Why bother cosign again? You can give the draft to me. - I'm his only son. - And I'm his only daughter-in-law. Sorry its government work. I can't give the draft to you. [BIRD CHIRPING] This happened because of you! I ask, in which house don't people fight? It doesn't mean you forget him! Wasn't it your duty to bring him back? God forbid! Nobody should get such a useless son! God knows what condition Dad must be in! - Thanks a lot. - No problem. This is the result of the 35 years of service you put in. You deserve it. I must go. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! How did you come here? Dad and Mom are here to meet you. - Greetings, father! - Greetings, father! How did you come here? Is everything fine? Dad, you left home and happiness and prosperity left with you. If we made a mistake, please overlook it. May the Lord punish me! If one cruel word escapes my lips, you may pull out my tongue! For the sake of God, spit out your anger and come back home! To grind flour? To wash clothes? To be scolded? - I swear by God.... - Don't take false promises. You'll face the Almighty with the face of a pig! Hen-pecked! You ruined everything for one woman! Father.... Wipe those crocodile tears! I understand everything. This is the miracle of money! My Provident Fund is dripping down your eyes! As if it's a bone not cash, that you smelt and came here! Hear this carefully! You won't get a single penny! Don't be so cruel-hearted! Take her away from my sight! The Rashid who lived off your leftovers is dead and gone! Keep one thing in mind, God forbid.... ....if your son throws you out of the house when he grows.... ....come here with my name. You'll get place to stay. We've interviewed you. We'll let you know later. Thank you, sir. Next. [BELL SOUND] - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Your name? Ramesh Kishen. - Age? - 26 years. - .Qualifications. - Cheating, deception. Swindling, craftiness, misappropriation. - Father. - Mr. Gupta.... We don't want such a qualified and educated man for this Job! Father. Chander! - What is this? - He is in difficulty. I want to help him. If you want to help them do it with money earned yourself! Our money is not for charity! That you distribute to beggars! Aren't you ashamed to insult them? You should be ashamed. You've started stealing! - You're crossing all limits! - You are crossing limits not me! Don't quarrel because of us. We came to you as we're family. I hate family! Go away from here. I don't want to see your faces! - This was very bad! - No it was good! Shut your mouth! I've been tolerating you for long! If you want to live off us, you'll have to put up with more! - Renu! - Shameless! How dare you! See how unjustly she behaved me! - I'm her husband! - I made the same mistake. Money can change the clothes not the body! You are right. Your father earned some money and forgot himself and his place! he blocked our means of livelihood! And you're responsible for it! - What's my fault? - The fault is of the cheap blood! The way your scoundrel of a father behaved with us... I should have thrown you out of the house at seeing that! But I'm not depraved. I won't do that. But you may leave if you want to. The door is open. Come dear. [BIRD CHIRPING] [HORN HONK] Two bars of Lux, one cream and one toothpaste. Excuse me first clear the old account. It's been 3 whole months. You owe me 450 rupees. I'll clear the debt. Trust me. The days of trust have gone sir. These days I'm little hard pressed. I'm not running a factory. I have a small business. If everyone takes credit, my whole business will flop! - But.... - I will give no credit now! Times change a bit and you turn away! have you forgotten you've taken thousands of rupees from these hands? But in return for goods. That was not charity! Neither have you done me any favours! When I don't have money, you stop giving credit! Is this decency? I know how decent you are! Have you forgotten it was you who.... ....closed your Dad's cigarette credit when he fell on bad times? Ramdulare! Kishen.... Forgive them. It is your own who are forgiven. I have forgotten them. I can't forget. My children ....will stay with me. That's impossible! Why not? Don't I have any worth, any respect in your eyes? Can't I do anything? Who was your partner in Joy and sorrow? It was me. I walked with you with a heavy heart. I never turned to look at the kids. Because I had the assurance that they are happy where they are. But today they are homeless, with no support. They are broken in every way. Whom are you mourning for? The ones who're perpetual wounds for parents? They cannot stay in my house! This is also my house! I too have some right over it! You have a right over my body and soul. You are everywhere but I have no place for your maternal love! Because today you have name! You have been blinded by the glitter of wealth! So blind that you can't see your own blood! Don't be so cruel! They are repenting for their deeds. And even God forgives all sins for one tear of repentance! I am not God! Kishen! One day you said I never asked you for anything in life. And I said I will ask for it when the time comes. And you said you'd wait for that day. The day has come. Give me my children! [TELEPHONE RINGING] - Hello. - Kishen.... It's quite late. You're still in the office. When are you coming home? I may not be able to come home. I have an important meeting going on. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [THUNDERING] Kishen! You came here in this storm? No storm could stop me today! Why aren't you coming home? There's no time. Work has increased. Work hasn't increased. It has got spoilt. Whom are you making excuses to? Showing this anger? To me? You know I don't get angry. It would be better if you would. You could hit me and be relieved! I would be at peace! But why are you burning me within? What are you saying? I know you better than I know myself. I supported my children so you left my side! You are punishing me so severely. You couldn't spend a minute without me Today it is 4 days and I am tossing on live embers. But you don't give a damn! You broke all relations, gave up your rights and came here. I'm living for you. You have enough people. A thorn pricked your heart Just because motherhood beckoned me! And you're sulking with it. Why don't you think of the cross roads I am at? Wherever I go, I am incomplete! Even a stone would melt at my state! But you are not even a stone! You are a lifeless soul! No love, emotions, feelings! You have no heart! You are heartless! [THUNDERING] You have no heart! You are heartless! You are heartless! You have no heart! You are heartless! You have no heart! You are heartless! Avtaar! Avtaar! Come, sir! Where is Avtaar? [WOMAN SOBBING] What's the matter? Is everything all right? When we were with you, we were really happy. But now he's not the same. He has changed totally. Today he has forgotten me! No! What are you saying? He can forget himself not you. I will always remember that night. And I'm giving this bail for Radha not Ramesh. I can't bear to see my life cry. What? Meaning... the bail was paid by... [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. Mistress! Come fast! Sir has suffered a stroke! Forgive me. Forgive me. Don't cry silly. I am fine. Radha. So far I was on duty. Looks like it's time for me to retire. Don't say that! 'Radha....' 'I have only one request.' 'After me make one Apna Ghar centre in every city of the country.' 'Make my dream come true.' 'From my property....' '....I leave 2 lakhs to Ramesh Kishen.' 'And 2 lakhs to Chander Kishen.' 'Not because they are my sons.' 'But because their behaviour gave me a new direction, showed me a new path.' 'Sewak, who all his life....' '....served me selflessly.' 'I wish to put one more burden on him. 'If something happens to me....' 'Then my body should be....' '....torched and cremated by Sewak.'
