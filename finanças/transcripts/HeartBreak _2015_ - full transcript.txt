Subtitles by explosiveskull We're closed, call back next month. Harry, it's George. George? Hey, George, hey, how's it going? Listen, there's a lot of action going down at Corner Pocket. New girl's been spreading chum around all week and now the big sharks are circling. How big do you think, huh? Big enough to make it worth your while. And you think he's gonna stick around for another game? The way he's been bragging, I'm guessing he'll double down against all comers. Really? Well, I'm on my way. Hey, brother. - Hey, thanks for calling. - Yeah. Hey, is it cool I'm here? I mean, do people know me? New owner, new patrons. They don't know your game. That the guy? Yeah, name's John Vance, low-level pro out of Miami. I've been watching him play, he's strutting around here like he won the seventh game of the World Series with a no-hitter. Yeah. But how's he play? Classic sharpshooter. Overextends, takes a lot of chances, likes to wow the crowd. I mean, he's decent, but he's not in your league. She's kinda cute. What's her story? Well, she got a world-class break, decent cut shot, but she's raw. But you know, I think we need to talk about the elephant in the room. Prostate, c'mon, I wanna hear it. I got an appointment up in Jacksonville, see a specialist. They wanna take a biopsy, rule out cancer. I'm concerned. Well, I'm sure it'll be fine. Besides, who needs a prostate? Hey, don't think you can march your cute little ass in here, start throwing around your hustle, and not have to face any consequences. Oh, are you gonna cry now, huh? No, I not cry. Yeah, somebody better have a tissue ready for this little girl. Bye bye. So who's next, huh? C'mon, I drove all the way up here from Miami looking for someone worth playing. Anybody? 10 grand, usual split. Seriously? You mean to tell me that the person with the biggest cojones in town came way of China? I got your cojones right here. I don't think you understand, gramps. This ain't a game for funsies. We're playing for a cash game. Did he seriously just call me gramps? He sure did. I don't think you understand something, Skippy. I got 10 grand right there says I'll beat you in a race to 11 in 9-ball. Put up or shut up. You got a stick? Well, I don't have a fancy two-piece pool cue like you have, but, honey, you got a stick back there? Here you go. Don't hurt yourself. Yeah, I think that's gonna work. I don't need much more to beat you. - Rack 'em up. - It'll be fun. Success in pool is based largely on your ability and how well you can exploit your opponent. And for a guy like this, a sharpshooter, well, you get 'em rattled by playing defensively. That means passing on difficult shots and enticing your opponent into taking risks. Now, dead stroke is where you wanna be. And that's where you can see and feel everything without any conscious effort. A hustler would have laid down a game or two by now. Set himself up for a future score. But I'm not a hustler. I didn't come here to shear a sheep. I came to skin a shark. And, well, sometimes, you just wanna show off. See ya, Skippy. That was a helluva party the next night. You remember, nurse Claire? - Whoo. - Oh, yeah, yeah. What a sweet thing she was. Yes, I can't believe you still remember her after that night. Well, you know, how can I forget that? But I am grateful we got out of that bar alive. Yeah, I'm just glad we got out of that whole godforsaken country alive. Yeah. Hey, well, we did good tonight, buddy. Hey, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, where you going? What do you think you're doing? Sit back down in that chair right there, we ain't done yet. It's still early, c'mon. No, I gotta go. I gotta be at a job site first thing in the morning. Oh, no, no, no, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You're gonna stay right here because you're gonna have a drink with me. One drink, come on, for me. For tonight. For that time. For Charlie company, huh? Okay, one drink. One drink, comin' up. There you go. Raise your glasses. To Pry, Muck, LaMar and T-Monster. The best damn company ever assembled. Follow me. I sure hate to see the place gutted like this. You need to figure out something here. Don't worry about it, it will be fine, believe me. Alright, let me go. Alright, get out of here. - Goodnight. - Catch you later. - Alright, see you tomorrow. - Okay, my brother. Here's to you guys. It's just those karate kids. What the hell are you doing here? Sorry. I tried knocking, thought nobody was here. Well, there is nobody here. Look around you, it's just me. I know, I was waiting just for you. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think you're doing here, huh, hon? If you're here to try and get your money back you're barking up the wrong tree. I not here for the money, just talking. Breaking and entering is a hell of a way to start a conversation. No, I no break in, door was open. See? You left the door open. Okay, I left the door open. What was so important that you woke me up and nearly got yourself killed? I need a good manager to make me number one player. George sent me see you. Why are you laughing? I'm sorry, George sent you? Yes. You don't need a manager dressed like that, you need a pimp. You no like it, I can wear whatever you want. Oh no, first off, I'm not a manager. Okay? Never wanted to be, never will be, never have been. Secondly, you don't have what it takes to become number one female player. Yes, I do. No. Yes, I do, before I come here to America, I play Korea number one player. That was Korea, this is America. I've seen you play. You got a hell of a break, I'll admit that. Thank you very much. But you have a flawed stroke, no table vision and you have absolutely no cue ball control. Understand? I understand and that's why I here. You help me, hmm? You're not hearing me. Lady, you don't have what it takes. You don't have the patience to get to where you wanna go. You don't know. Yes, I do know. I saw you gambling the other night. Hmm? How much of your money did you lose, huh? What, a quarter of it? Half of it? All of it? Most, but not all of it. I'm sorry, that right there proves my whole point. Reckless betting like that, it tells me everything I need to know about your patience. Now, I'm a very busy man and I have a lot of, um, things to do. So, bye bye. What? Yeah, you broke in, break back out again. Right through there. George very wrong about you. Ow! Oh, no. Harry! You've got to be kidding me. What'd I do? Harry, we had a bad start, I'm sorry. I want to prove you wrong about me, okay? I am patient and a good student. I am sah-dan, fourth dan in Haidong Gumdo. It's a very difficult rank to achieve. It takes many years of training, discipline, focus and patience. I have no idea what you just said. Oh, you don't know Gumdo? Gumdo means the Korean way of the sword. Oh, alright. Maybe you know Japanese Kendo? Kendo you fight one opponent, but in Haidong Gumdo we focus on fighting many opponent at the same time. Well, I don't know Kendo and you don't know the amount of fuel it takes to get to where you want to go. You want to become number one pool player. Yes. Wanting to become is not enough! No, it is enough. My son, Jung Soo, is enough. This is my son, Jung Soo, he have autism. His tutor is very good, but very expensive. I here with nobody. No family, no friends because pro tour is my way to help my son. Lady, I sympathize with you, really I do, but I'm not the right guy for this. But Harry, you are The Captain. I was The Captain. I'm not The Captain anymore, so please stop coming here! Stop harassing me! Stop asking for my help! Forget you ever met me because I'm not interested! George, I don't believe you. You're a piece of work. What? That girl you sent to me. Talked to me about her special needs kid. That's low. - Was it? - Mm-hmm. How many times have you sat here and told me if you had one do-over, just one, you'd help Maggie with her dyslexia sooner? You can help this girl avoid that same pain. And based on the way your place looked last night you need this as much as she does. I don't need anything. Now you look at me. I understand my lifestyle is not for everybody but I do what I want, I eat what I want and I drink what I want and I don't answer to anybody but me. For how long? How much of your retirement money you got left? If you keep sending those games to me I'll be just fine. Oh, and this is gonna be your legacy, huh? This is the way the last chapter of The Captain's gonna play out? You not taking care of yourself, sleeping on the sofa drowning in a sea of booze? I've had a bad spell. Now look, when I get things worked out with Ellie I'll get it all back together, I promise. Harry, this girl, she's got talent. And with your help she could make a career for herself. Then let her find somebody else to coach her. She's not my problem. She's just not my problem. And I've got enough crap on my plate without you piling this stuff on top of me! - Alright? - Okay, okay, I'll back off. But I can't help but see this as an opportunity that would benefit both of you. Okay, here we go. You're my best friend, Daddy. All I did was drink some alcohol. I don't need to go to that school, Dad, please! Please, don't let her take me! Get your hands off me! You're a liar! You don't love me, you sent me away! I had no idea they were gonna shoot those guns. I was so high, I thought they were firecrackers! I don't deserve to go to prison. Not for just sitting in a car! Look, we got off on the wrong foot and I... Wait, I don't even know your name. What's your name? Mina. Mina what? Mina Li. Mina Li, that's an unusual name. Look, Mina, do you know baseball? Baseball? Baseball, you know it, you like it? So-so, I like to watch. I think we need to talk a little bit, you and I. Okay, here's my keys and you drive and we'll talk. Now, come on, we're just gonna go watch some baseball and we're gonna talk, okay? Okay. Good. You know who Mike Lillejord is, the baseball player? No. That's him right there. He was a decent major league pitcher but he struggled with flawed mechanics, a lot like you. Now, eventually he got tired of losing and he decided to take a risk and change his throwing motion. So he took a year off, hired a pitching coach and started all over again. It was a risky move. Could have ended his career, but it didn't. He put everything, everything on the line for greatness and it paid off. You know what the Cy Young award is? Well, it's a trophy they give to the best pitchers of each league every year. He won it twice. You spit yet? Spit. Well, that is pathetic. Here, get a handful of seeds. Put 'em in your mouth like this. Not one or two, the whole thing. Put 'em all in your mouth. Keep 'em on one side of your mouth, like one side or the other. Now you pull one shell over, crack it with your teeth, eat the seed, move the other shell, spit. Look, if I'm gonna be your manager you're gonna have to do exactly what I say. You dress like a lady. You don't gamble and you put everything on the line for greatness. You got it? I got it. You got it, good. Alright, here's how it's gonna go. George is gonna put up all the costs for tournaments and travel. Our end will be a third of the winnings and 25% of any endorsements. Now if you can agree to that and you like that, I can't believe I'm gonna say this... I'll be your manager. Deal? Deal! Oh. You don't really spit into your hand, you just... I sorry. That's alright, I'll teach you how to do that, too. Okay. Oh! Hi. Oh, hi. Good morning. Okay, there are nine qualifiers before the end of the season. But just making the pro tour is not for us. No. You see, in order to make a comfortable living from endorsements, well, you gotta be in the top five. No, number one American player. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, number one, but all we need is top five. No, number one. Okay, fine number one. But in order to do that, we need to fix your stroke. So follow me. Grab my bottle. Come inside. What is that? Weight lifters, when they go do bench press contests, they wear a harness that limits their motion. This is the same idea. When you put this on it will limit the shrugging muscles in your body to keep you from lifting up when you stroke. It keeps your elbow from flaring out. Okay, it's the same kind of thing, it helps you out. Alright, now put it on. Like that and like that. Take your hair out of it. Okay, right in here, there. There and right there. Now we gotta adjust it. You ready? Oh, oh! How does that feel? Very tight. Yeah, good, it's supposed to. Oh, I almost forgot. Now, shrug your shoulders. Yeah, go ahead and laugh. Every time you use bad form that buzzer's gonna sound. You're gonna hear it and, more importantly, I'm gonna hear it. You want me play wearing the vest? That's right. But I want you to concentrate on your weak shots, that's bank and rail shots only. 20 times each. Anytime you hear that buzzer goes off, that means you're using bad form and you gotta start all over again from the beginning. You got it? Neh. What do you mean, no? No, I mean, yes. Why didn't you just say yes? I, no, neh means 'yes'. Yeah, whatever! Just go shoot the shots. No buzzing. - I... - Go on. I don't like to wear. You'll get used to it. How's it going? I cannot break with the vest. Use more wrist. So how are you doing? Bruises, big, here and here, it's okay. Yeah, that happens, you'll get used to it. Here, let me take a look here. There. Let me ask you something. Do you anything about mantras? I know mantra. It's a chanting used to motivate. Exactly. Well, I have a mantra for your shooting. And I want it to become so ingrained in your muscle memory that it becomes automatic, just like that. You got it? Okay, first part of the mantra. See the pattern. You see, with each spread of balls there is one easiest path to victory. And in order to find that path you need to see the entire table and use all possible shots. Now you've seen the pattern. The second part of the mantra, nobody here but me. And what that mean is, once you've committed to the shot, I want you to become a robot. You approach the table the same. You line up the shot the same. You take your stance the same, no matter who's here, who's watching, what the stakes are. Everything else around you dissolves into the background until it's nobody here but you. Say that. Nobody here but you. Nobody here but me. Nobody here but me. Good, now, you've seen the pattern. You're focused, nobody here but me. Third part of the mantra is my favorite shot. You see, once you've committed to the shot and you're focused, you've seen the pattern, no matter how difficult your shot may be, it becomes your favorite shot. Say it. My favorite shot. Very good. Now, say the mantra. See the pattern. See the pattern. Nobody here but me. Nobody here but me. My favorite shot. My favorite shot. Very good! Now, same exercises as yesterday. Uh, 40 times each. Do the mantra! See the pattern. See the pattern. Nobody here but me. Nobody here but me. My favorite shot! My favorite shot. What? Ugh! Harry, I finish. I leaving now. ♪ And we fight for the right ♪ ♪ And keep our Nation's might ♪ ♪ And the Army goes rolling along ♪ Oh, I look for vest, but not here. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna give you the day off from the vest. How are the bruises? Bruises okay, same as Gumdo. Whatever. Today we are going to start the process of training your mind. These are mental exercises. Exercises designed to help you see the pattern. So, I want you to do these workbooks. I want you to do them in the order that I marked them because they get progressively more difficult. Once you complete one you check your answers against these. You got it? Got it. Alright, get to work. We haven't got all day. See the pattern. See the pattern. Do the work! I do the work. Do it fast! Okay. Hi. Yes, uh yeah, one trip to Hawaii and you bring this crap back. Mina! Mina Li, come in here, George wants to show you something! Okay. It's not much to look at but it sure beats sleeping in the car. Yeah. - Come on in, take a look. - Wow! What do you think? It look nice, it's very clean now. Yeah, well, we set this up for you. This is your room now. My room? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yes, your room. Look, it don't have a shower, but you can use the girls' room. But you can eat, sleep and breath pool without worrying about rent. No, I cannot. Hold it, hold it. Wait, wait. George spent a lot of time putting this together for you. You wanna hurt his feelings, disrespect him? This is for me? It's for you. Thank you. It was a pleasure... Alright, you two cut it out. Alright, look, why don't you take some time off? Fix the room up the way you like it, 'cause George and I, we're gonna go to the VFW to meet some friends. Let's go, George. Okay, thank you. Yeah, well, don't thank me now. See, when I get back we will discuss how you will earn your keep. Yeah, come in. Mina, what is it? Uh... I think you misunderstood what I meant by earning your keep. I see the way you look at me. I understand. This is all I have to give you. Mina, put your robe back on, come over here and sit down. I wanna show you something. Put it on. These are pictures of my daughter, Maggie. Not too long ago she used to wear that vest and study in this workbooks, just like you. But, Mina, when I... When I watch you shoot pool, you remind me of her. She very beautiful. She live here? She used to. Now she's a couple of hours away doing some time for a mistake she made. What you mean, she in jail? Well, she's in prison. She's about halfway through a three year sentence. You know you told me once about your boy. Your boy has autism. My daughter, Maggie, was kind of the same thing but she has dyslexia. You know that? It's very bad, things get turned around backwards. Very hard for you. We didn't figure out what it was until it was too late and she got crowded in with a bunch of remedial kids. These are kids with really bad discipline problems, basically bad kids. No parent wants that for their kids, right? No. No, because they wind up getting in with the wrong crowd. You know, for teenagers, friends are everything. What you're doing for your boy is good. A number one! Yes. I just wonder if we caught it early enough and helped her out at an early age, that things would have turned out differently. But, what are you gonna do? It's time for you to go to bed. You got a busy day tomorrow. You're going back in the vest. Okay. When we find out Jung Soo have autism my husband could not bear it. He was embarrassed and blame me. He divorce me and marry another woman. My father feels shame so I move to Seoul. Live with my sister. Part of me still hated my father for this. But part of me only want him to hold me and make everything okay. You understand? Yes, I understand. Go to bed. Okay. Alright, you got 10 minutes. You've got a lot of nerve showing up here. Hi, Mags, how are you? I'm in prison, Dad. How do you think I am? I'm sorry, what I meant was... Why now? I've been here for over a year! Did your car break down outside and you figured, what the hell, why not see my only daughter? Maggie, I have wanted to come here every day you've been incarcerated, but you told me not to come here and I was just trying to... I also asked you not to send me to the Pendleton School, but you did that anyway! I made a mistake. A mistake, Dad? As in one? Was I really so awful that I was beyond parenting? That your only option was to send me that school? I made a lot of mistakes. But I think that I'm ready now... Maggie... Coming here has forced me to face a lot of hard truths. And one of those truths is that when I needed you the most, when mom needed you the most, you were there the least. I can forgive the mistakes, I can forgive the boozing, I can even forgive the affair, but I can't forgive the abandonment. Don't come back! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie! How do you eat with these things? I'm not sure, but we're gonna figure it... Oh, this is some spread here. I hope you like dinner. Okay, in Korean tradition, family eat soup from the same big dish because family close and we share everything. Okay, well should we say grace or what is the custom? In Korea you would say jal meokkessseumnida, which means, 'I will eat good'. Say it again. Jal. Jal. Meokkessseumnida. Meokkessseumnida. Jal meokkessseumnida. You sound funny. Jal meokkessseumnida. Jal meokkessseumnida. Okay, and then I say which means... Bless you. - No, kind of like 'enjoy'. - Oh, okay. And then I serve because in Korea elder eat first. - Okay, well, him. - Him. No, it's you, you're older than I am. You've been older than I am forever. Mina, you can serve me first, thank you. You try here and if you like use a spoon and take from bowl, okay? Okay. Want some? Yes. Okay. This is delicious, Mina. This is called. Dog? A rice cake, - but it's chewy. - Not dog! You might like it, I like very much. Okay, I'll try this. It's spicy, though. Okay, you try one, too. Okay. I'd like to make a toast. Here's to our success on the southeastern qualifying circuit. Okay. Come on. Sorry, I'm so excited. Alright, calm down, calm down. Before you get too excited let me remind you that our goal here is not to win this tournament. Our goal is to become what? Elite. Elite, that's right. So today, and until I tell you otherwise, we're gonna be limiting how you play your game. Okay, I want you to focus on your weakest shots until those weaknesses become strengths. Okay, and then what? Then what? You play. You take whatever your opponent leaves you and when it's your turn, no cut shots over 45 degrees, that's all. Got it? Okay. Sign in, Mina Li. Hi. I told you it doesn't matter if you win. You're here to compete! To learn what you're up against. How I compete if I cannot use my full game? You don't have a full game! And you never will unless and learn how to expand your shot selections. Other people see my shot and say you coaching wrong! Well, I don't really care what other people say. It's my way, you got it? And you lost focus badly. Remember, nobody here but me. Say it! Nobody here but me. Louder! Nobody here but me. One more time with passion! Nobody here but me! Nobody here but me, ah! Hey Mag, Mag! If you really wanna help out I have something for you. Anything at all, anything I can do. I need you to help out a friend of mine on the outside. My first week in prison was hell on earth. I didn't leave my cell for three days. Not to eat, not to exercise, not for anything. Finally, this woman, Carmen, took me under her wing. She escorted me to meals, took me to yard. She helped me to get clean. Inside these walls we form a family just like the outside. People take on roles; fathers, mothers, sisters and babies. I was a baby and Carmen was my mother. There were times during those first few weeks when she was the only thing that was keeping me going. She got parole and met this guy, fell in love. Things were going fine but then he fell off the wagon and it got really ugly. So she bailed, but all of her stuff is at this guy's trailer and she's afraid to go back by herself. So you want me to help her move? Yeah, but she doesn't want the cops involved. It would mean the world to me to know that somebody looked out for her the way she looked out for me. But you couldn't be there when her ex is. You'd have to get in, get the stuff and get out. He's kind of a loose cannon. I don't know what he would do if he found you. You don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Great day, huh? Hey, you hear that? That's him! Carmen, get in the truck, lock the door! Alright, everybody. Go, go, go, beat it! What is wrong with you? We're gonna make a left. Let's just see if anybody's coming. I am ready. I am ready, I am good enough... Whoa, whoa, whoa! I could win qualifier if you let me! Slow down, slow down, hold on, hold on! I don't know what happened back there, but you need to take a deep breath. Come on, deep breath, in and out, let it out. Okay, good. Now, you cannot win on the pro tour. And even if you could that's not our goal. Our goal is elite and you're nowhere near that yet. I already elite. I elite right now! No, you're not! Yes, I am. Fine, prove it! Show me the pattern. Go! No, no, I don't need pattern! I win with no pattern! No against the Jeanettes, the Allisons or the Ewa Laurances of the world. They will chew you up and spit you out! No, I spit them. I beat them! No, you won't. How do you know? Fine! You wanna play an elite player, right? Yes. Who? You tell me who, I'll make it happen. You're joking? I never joke! Who? Jeanette Lee. You wanna play Jeanette Lee? Fine. I'll make it happen, tomorrow night. - Thank you, Harry! - Get off me, get off me! People will talk, go on. Go practice. - Thank you. - Go practice! - Show me the pattern. - Show you the pattern. All rails, bank shots, no cuts! Okay. That girl is gonna be the death of me. Or make me drink harder. Ah, well here they are. Mina, I would like to introduce you to Mr. Bobby Black. What's up? He's our version of Jeanette Lee. I don't understand. George, why don't you enlighten the young lady? Well, one of my talents is analyzing pool players. I can break down all their strengths and weaknesses. So when Harry said you wanted a game with Jeanette I knew just the guy to call. You play as good as Jeanette Lee? I don't know. All I know is these guys offered me 50 bucks to play you. You pay him? You don't worry about what I do. You focus on your game. This is a race to nine at 9-ball. If you beat him the next tournament there's no restrictions. But, if you lose, handicaps stay. Deal? Deal. Good luck. Don't need luck. Hey kid, come here. Extra 50 in it for you if you beat her. - Go ahead. - Cool. Good save. Bingo, baby. Mina, it was very nice meeting you. You the same. Gentlemen, thank you. You bet. Let me know when you want another game. Alrighty. What if I never win a qualifier? What are you talking about? You got six more chances. You'll make it, just remember, see the pattern, no one here but me, my favorite shot. I see the pattern and nobody here but me. My favorite shot. I think she'll be alright. I know. Well, she's working hard enough at it. It's your move. Very good. So I take it everything worked out good for Carmen? Yeah, she traded in her car for a station wagon, moved out of state. Oh, well, good. I'll tell you what, the next time you see George you ought to thank him, too. - Do you ever talk to Mom? - No. We didn't exactly split on the best of terms. I know it's not my place, but it's really important to me that the two of you stay friends... Can we not talk about her, please? Anything but that. I started painting. Really? I'm not any good but they have classes here, so... It helps to pass the time. I'd like to see one sometime. Well, maybe I'll give you one the next time you come visit. What do you want, horses or flowers? Horses. I love horses. Horses it is. Why you leave me? You didn't follow the rules. What's the point of always losing? Oh, so you won! No, I lose in the next round. Oh well, hey, everybody, big surprise! I spent the money on the taxi ride. My money almost gone. Maybe now the lesson will stick! I need to qualify to make the pro tour! Then get better and follow the damn rules! I do! Get out! Go on, get out of here! Go practice! Close the door on the way behind you! Okay, Harry. Here we go. Ellie? Harry! What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood and uh, you know, I needed some help with my tie. I thought I'd just stop by and say hi. That's sweet, Harry. Thanks. This is Harry? As in, 'the Harry'? I have been wanting to talk to you for a long time. Harry, this is Richard. Richard, this is Harry. It's good to meet you, Harry. If you don't mind, I'd love to run home and grab some papers. Richard, no, now's not the time! Honey, this is the perfect time. What papers? What's he talking about? The divorce papers. You know Ellie. She's been sitting on them for months now worried about how you're gonna take it. And I keep telling her, it's been two years, he's gonna welcome this. Let's pull off the Band-Aid already. Let's get it done. Why don't you just shut up? What's your problem, pal? I'd like to have a civil conversation with my wife in private. If you've got something to say, just say it. Back off. - Have you been drinking? - Seriously! Boys! - You need to back off! - Please! He's the one out driving around reeking like a whiskey keg. You want me to call the cops? Let 'em know that we got a DUI situation on our hands? Richard, stop! Harry, I really can't deal with this right now. Harry, Harry, go. Please. You know, I just... I know. I know. Go. Mister, I need to play tonight, okay? You know Harry, Mr. Harry Platt, okay? - I know who he is. - You know him! I know who he is, there's no exceptions. All registration fees have to be paid prior to the start of the tournament. How much more time I have? You got 15 minutes. Is he close? I don't know. I call him right now, okay? Good luck, let me know if you reach him. Okay. Oh, did you see that, huh? Did you see that? Am I not great or what? I'm like the Bobby Fisher of pool. I disappeared. But now I'm back.

Why does it say Lady Samurai? I didn't know there was a difference. Alright. Mina... Look, I don't know how to talk to people, it's not in me to do that very well, but... I'm sorry. I wanted to say how proud I am of you and I wanted to thank you. And I also want to say I believe in you. And if you'll have me, I sure would like to finish what we started.

Okay, open it up, I think you're gonna like it. It's very special. I didn't have much time and if, Lady Samurai I thought was... I don't know what I was thinking. This is a special gift given to me and it's a Nitti cue. A Nitti cue? Yeah, it's A number one cue. It meant a lot to me and I think it will mean a lot to you as well. Get back to work. Okay. Practice. Mina, hold up. Let me have the cue. Show me the pattern. Okay. I start here. One corner pocket, draw back and then here. Are you sure? Take your time, see the whole pattern. Okay. Think it through. You can do it. Now you see it. Okay, start here. Show me, 10 seconds, each ball. Okay. There you go. Here. One corner pocket, okay? Uh-huh. Here. Three side pocket.

In our continuing effort to bring you the best in sports, the Pfafford Sports Network proudly presents the Southeast Women's 9-ball Tour. Welcome to Florida for the last qualifying event of the season. The stories of the week have to be our two finalists. The reigning champion, the Striking Viking, Ewa Mataya Laurance, and upstart amateur, Mina Li. The end of the year qualifier always has the biggest turnout. You got all the amateurs here trying to take that last chance to be able to qualify for the pro tour, and then you have all the pros. We're here to warm up for the big event at the end of the year. Oh, Mina! How do you see your chances at winning this tournament? No comment, no comment. Please, we're just here to play. Just here to play, thank you. What do you make of tournament Cinderella, Mina Li? You know what? She's got really a strong game. I saw her hit a few balls, she's really playing well. But there's a big difference between playing well in the earlier parts of the tournament and actually winning. Remember, we're here to win. The competition here on the Southeast Women's 9-ball Tour has been intense all week. With players battling for a spot in the final match. 64 competitors came to Florida including a number of proven tour veterans, as well as newcomers, trying to make the jump into the big time. And certainly no one in that category has been more impressive or surprising than Mina Li. A brilliant combination of shot making skill, position play and determination carried her through her matches. As, one by one, she dispatched players earlier thought to be favorites. Building on her momentum, the victories brought Mina to a semi-final match against tour veteran Dawn Hopkins. And after a tense and close match throughout, with both players seemingly in position to win, it was Mina who moved on. Hailing from South Korea, Mina credits her son as the inspiration for her incredible performance. For the defending champion and legendary Hall of Famer, Ewa Laurance, it's been nothing short of total domination over the field which included Shannelle Lorraine, who she beat to get to this final match. As Ewa looks to sharpen her game for upcoming major tour events. It's been a beautiful week in the sunshine state, though rain has kept some of the crowd away for our final match tonight. I think those who stayed home are going to miss something special. The stage has been set for what should be a terrific climax to the Southeast Women's 9-ball Tour event. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Florida. I'm Mitch Laurance, glad to have you with us, as always. As we are down to just two here at the final qualifier of the season and what a tale it is. Beginning with what I think has to be the story of the week, Mina Li. Literally coming from out of nowhere, playing tremendous 9-ball under pressure. Her opponent, the number one ranked player in the world, the member of the Hall of Fame, the Striking Viking, Ewa Mataya Laurance, who is playing confidently as expected and definitely on a roll. It's gonna be a great matchup. On paper, Ewa would have to be the overwhelming favorite, but given the way that Mina's been controlling her cue ball and playing, you have to give her at least a puncher's chance. It's time to find out whether the unheralded amateur, now an overnight sensation in her native country, has got what it takes to go toe to toe with the Striking Viking. Let's get it done. After winning the opening lag, Ewa sets the tone early against Mina and follows a picture perfect break with some beautiful shot making and fantastic position play. Mina can only sit and watch as Ewa, a two time U.S. Open World and National 9-ball champion, puts on a clinic in the first rack and shows off her considerable skills while doing so. As she jumps out to a quick one-nothing lead in this race to nine, to the delight of an appreciative crowd. The next two racks go much the same way. Ewa jumping to a three-nothing lead. But Mina finally gets on the scoreboard in the fourth rack, still trailing, however, by two. In rack five Ewa comes right back with shots like this one. She pockets the three and plays perfect four rail position to get on the form, spectacular. Ewa finishes off that rack for a four-one lead and she continues firing on all cylinders in the sixth rack. How many times have we seen this before? When the Striking Viking is playing like this, moving smoothly and playing with perfect cue ball control, she, indeed, makes the game look much easier than it is. This 9-ball, for a commanding five-one lead over, at this point, a helpless Mina Li. Mina makes some terrific shots like this 9-ball bank to get within six-three. But Ewa refuses to let her mount any kind of sustained comeback. Two more perfect breaks, more incredible shot making and patterns, coupled with this kind of speed control and position with the cue ball, get an obviously pleased Ewa to the hill at eight-four. One rack from a successful defense of her title. The players have taken a short break. Very understandable since it's all come down to this. Ewa Laurance trying to defend her title and add to a long list of victories. Mina Li, on the other hand... What's wrong? She very good. She playing perfect. Well, of course, she's very good. So are you and you're both at the finals, remember that. Look, she's like any other player. You just have to get your focus back. I believe in you. And I am very proud of you. A number one. A number one. You go out there and do what you came here to do. Okay. Go get her. One further note, Ewa Laurance, a great presence on the world stage, but I have to say, based on what I've seen over the last few days, Mina Li may be emerging as a great new star. Now it's do or die for Mina Li. She needs every rack from here on and this is a great start. A terrific break and with solid shots during the 13th rack she gets it to eight-five. Hanging in, once again. In the alternating break format Ewa comes with a powerful break but no balls drop this time. Mina finds herself with a really tough opening shot on the one. But this is what we've seen from this amazing newcomer is she makes three balls with a single stroke and now we've got a match for sure. Wow! Mina with two balls on the break, but absolutely nothing on the one, a critical shot. Mina makes the one. And the cue ball heads down table, rolling, rolling. And sinks the nine, unbelievable! Is this ever worth a second look. She goes cross corner with the one, putting tremendous spin on the cue ball and with perfect angles and speed, gets down table for that nine, watching it all the way. Fantastic stuff from Mina Li who's totally found the zone! And you can bet the crowd's into it now as the momentum has definitely shifted with Mina suddenly trailing Ewa Laurance by only one rack. Really feeling it now after running a beautiful rack. Mina Li, incredibly, with this nine to end rack 16 and to get to hill-hill after seemingly being all but finished. She has really shown us all what a tough competitor she is. All tied up now and the pressure is tangible. See the pattern. See the pattern. Nobody here but me. Nobody here but me. My favorite shot. My favorite shot. Rack 17, the final rack of the tournament for these two players. Mina slightly out of position here. On the rail and with an extremely tough cut on the four, especially under the circumstances. But no problem for Mina, beautifully played. And Ewa obviously feeling the Mina Li heat. If Mina can hold her nerves together she should be out from here. Mina obviously not pleased and you can see why. Not enough speed to get off the end rail on this shot on the eight. Straight in with no chance to do anything but accept that position and leave herself a long cut on the nine. There you go. You can see the nine on the long rail. It's all come down to this. One shot for the title and surely one of the biggest upsets we've seen in women's pool. There's the nine frozen to the rail, making this shot even tougher. Mina ready. And here's the stroke. Cuts the nine super thin. It comes off the rail a bit. Comes down the rail. Yes! Unbelievable! Mina Li has just upset the number one player in the world to win the Southeast Women's 9-ball Tour final! Two days ago... Subtitles by explosiveskull
