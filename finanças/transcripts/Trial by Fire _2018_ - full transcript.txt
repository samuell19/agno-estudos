- Daddy! My babies. -Mom? Mom! - My babies, help! Mommy, come here. There's a fire! There's a fire in there! Call the fire department! Yes. Hello, I'd like to report fire. Yes, it's 1213 West 11th Street. Uh, yeah. It's my-- It's my neighbor's. Yes, there is... There's babies in there. I don't know. There's been an explosion. Oh, my God. Please, God. -Please, let them be all right. Please, please, God. I'm sorry. It didn't start in here. What a sick puppy. Well, lookie here. He didn't take no chances. Check this out. Crazed glass. Kids' room. Piece of shit waited 'till they were asleep. So, he pours the accelerant here. -And it flashes over. -It goes straight out the door. -Right along that baseboard. -Yup. Onto the porch. Son of a bitch. We'll nail him. Thank you for coming down, folks. -I know how hard this must be. This is Mr. Fogg, Mr. Vasquez. They're investigating the fire. Our condolences. Y'all find out anything? We're still trying to find our way. Think you might be able to help us figure out a couple things. Of course. It's Stacy, right? Now, you weren't in the house at the time of the fire. That's right. She works nights sometimes, stopped on the way home from work. Whereabouts was it you stopped, darling? I stopped at the Salvation Army to get the babies some presents. -At 9:00 in the morning? -Well, Christmas is coming -and we're broke, so... -Of course. How about the day before? Anything unusual happen? No, sir. Hey, there. How are my precious ladies? Ooh, why are you crying? They've been crying all fucking morning. You girls are lucky. If your mama wasn't so pretty, you three wouldn't be here. Oh, you fucking stink. What, do you think you can just stay out all night and then come home and sweet-talk me? Honey, I had a couple o' drinks. I already got one DUI, so I stopped at Mikey's. -What? -Nothing. Have at it. So, that night, you went to work? Yeah, I work nights. We need the money. And you stayed at home with the kids? -You do that a lot? -That's right. I guess I'm one of them stay-at-home dads everybody's talking about. There's another dinner in the oven if you're hungry. Who is it this time, Todd? Who was who? I already told you -where I was last night. -You ain't told me shit. You think I'm stupid? What the fuck is this? Baby, you're the one that said you don't wanna have no more children. Then what's it doing in your wallet, you bastard? I don't know. -I thought maybe surprise sex-- -You're such a fucking liar. I could smell the bitch on you when you walked in this morning. -I'm not lying to you, honey. -Mm-hmm. You ain't worth shit -for a husband. -Bitch! I'm here every goddamn day taking care of these kids. Oh, yeah? And why's that? Why are you here every goddamn day taking care of these kids? Because you don't have a fucking job, that's why. Because you are a fucking loser. Better shut the fuck up that shit right now-- Or what? -I swear to God, woman. -You hit me again? Go on. Oh, yeah, that's right. You can't hit me. Because if you do, then I can't go to work, and I can't make you money to go out drinking and fucking whatever the fuck else you do. So, Stacy went to work that night and you just, uh, stayed in bed? Yes, sir. Had a few beers, maybe? No. Reckon your kids sleep pretty sound? Usually. And then that night? It was morning. I was asleep, so I thought I was dreaming at first. - Daddy! -But then I realized I could hear Amber screaming, "Daddy! Daddy!" Daddy! Everything was full of smoke. I couldn't see nothing but black. It smelled like it did when the microwave blowed up last month. -Fires, lights popping. - Daddy! Girls! So, I made it to their room and... I had to kick through the child-proof thing. I never felt anything so hot in my life. I thought I'd found Amber, but she was gone. Amber. Girls. Amber! Girls! I couldn't take the heat, so... I had to get outside, catch my breath. That's when I hollered out for my neighbor to call emergency. Can you think of why anyone would wanna hurt your family? No, sir. We had three of the prettiest babies anybody could've asked for. Off and on, we'd fight and break up for a while, but it was always the babies that brought us back together. Neither of us could've lived without them kids. Sometimes, I wish Amber had never woke me up. You know, Todd, you've been in trouble before. -Yes, sir. -A couple of those times when we asked you what happened, you didn't exactly tell the truth, isn't that so? No, sir. But you're telling the truth now? Yes, sir. Just as Jesus, the Lamb of God, was taken too soon, so too were these three innocents, taken back to the bosom of the Lord. How else are we to understand the loss of Amber, Karmen, and Kameron. Do you wanna stop somewhere and maybe get... -something to eat? -Cameron Todd Willingham, I don't wanna hear your voice. And maybe never again. -I'm hurting, too, baby-- -Did you hear a word I said? Oh, if you're gonna start demonizing me, -speak to me like-- -I'll speak to you -however I please. -You will not either. Baby, if we're ever gonna get through this, -we gotta work together on-- -Stop the car. Stop the car, let me out of the car. -Why? Why, what's the matter-- -Stop the car! -I won't stop the car-- -Stop the fucking car, Todd! -Tell me why. -Let me out of the car! Stop the fucking car, Todd! -Let me out of the car! -Stop the fucking car! Those were my babies! Those were my babies and you didn't save them! They were my babies! My babies, Todd! Driver! Exit the vehicle, put your hands up where I can see them. Do it now! Turn around, face away from me. Interlace your hands behind your head. Do not look back. Cameron Todd Willingham... you're under arrest for murder. -Murder? - You come with me. -Who did I kill? -Come on. We'll talk about it at the station. Let's go, Todd. You know the way. I only just buried them, Marty. This is some fucked up bullshit. Stand right there. Let's go. You're a real piece of shit, you know that? Your own kids? -Jesus, man. -I didn't do it, Marty. Fuck you! Hey, fuck you! Man, would you get the fuck down from there? This ain't no fucking zoo! Jesus fucking Christ. You want a banana? That'll make you calm down? They ain't gonna throw you no fucking peanuts, you know that, right? Who're you talking to, boy? I was just talking to that mullet, you know, she's real cute. She gave me a little wink, you know. -This yours? -Hey. Yours? Get up. Look, I'm good, man. I was just fucking around. You ain't gotta take shit so personal. You smell like you wanna be left alone. If you plead guilty, you might live. I'm not confessing to something I didn't do. I'll say any goddamn thing you like, but I will not say I killed my own kids. With the evidence they got, -they're gonna-- -I'm going to take the stand and I'm gonna talk to the judge about it. Idiot, they will tear you up on the stand. Oh, they better. Boy, you're about as dumb as you look-- What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Todd, calm down. Oh, listen to him! They wanna kill me? Good. They better start digging my grave now, because I'll die before I say I killed my own kids. Boy, I am the only thing between you and the needle right now. No way in hell I'm putting you on that stand. Good morning, Texas. This is KZYZ. The phone lines are burning up. Let's hear from you. I never liked him. I always thought there was something kind of off about him, and it doesn't surprise me a little bit. They should fry him. -He needs to burn in hell. - What kind of daddy would kill his own babies like that? Things like this don't happen here. Hey, I'll shoot him myself. Boy took three innocent lives. The only thing I regret is, we can't kill him three times over. Members of the jury, I'd like you to take a look at the sweet faces of these beautiful babies... Karmen and Kameron, barely a year old and already brimming with life. Little Amber, eagerly waiting for Santa's visit in only two days. Now, I want you to imagine these little angels... -...burning in their beds. This was no arson. This was murder. Well, I barely poked my head out the door when... he just stood there with a strange look in his eyes-- -That's total bullshit. - Shut up. To the best of your knowledge, did Todd Willingham ever make an attempt to get back in that house? He was too worried about that car of his. He didn't try to save those kids till the cops showed up. And it was like he was... putting on a show. Fire talks to you, it does not lie. Then what did that fire tell you? That it was deliberately set by human hands. Can you be more specific? Someone poured gasoline through those children's room, even under their bed in the shape of a pentagram, the symbol of the devil. He kept pouring down the hallway to the front door, creating a fire barrier, preventing any escape. That fire was hotter than the hinges of hell. We found evidence of what we call crazed glass, another indication it was goosed by liquid additive. Worst of all, the refrigerator was moved to block the backdoor. Someone made that house into a death trap. Inspector Vasquez, how many arson cases have you worked on? I reckon more than 1,200 fires. And to the best of your knowledge, have you ever been mistaken? Sir, fire does not destroy evidence, it creates it. If I've ever been wrong, it's never been pointed out. Mr. Horton? No questions, Your Honor. Mr. Webb, you shared a cell with Todd Willingham at the Navarro County Jail, is that correct? Yes, sir. And what did he tell you at that time? Well, he... He said that... he came home and that one of his children was hurt or even dead or whatever. -What? -And then so, he started-- He decided that he was gonna cover it up by starting a fire. Hell no. Did he tell you who it was that injured that child? He did. He said it was his wife. -What? -Yeah. He said she was crying, yeah, and carrying on with such emotion. He just decided to take some paper and wad it up, and then he burnt it in a way that made it look like them children was playing with it and such. And did Willingham ever threaten you about telling anybody -what he had told you? -Yeah. He pointed his finger at me and did like this. I'll kill you. -Thank you, Mr. Webb. -Y'all need to start speaking some fucking truth around here! -Calm down. You just sit down. -I am! No, no, this is corrupt. Don't believe that shit. That shit never happened, Judge. Control your client. -Counselor. - That shit didn't happen. -Counselor. -You took an oath, didn't you? Start speaking some fucking truth then, boy. -This is my courtroom, sir. Mr. Jackson, call your next witness. Mr. Evans, you have firsthand knowledge of Todd Willingham's history of violent behavior, don't you? Yes, sir. Would you explain to us what transpired between the two of you? I mean, maybe me and Stacy was flirting a little, but it ain't mean nothing. Hell, Stacy, she's like that, and Todd sort of liked it. Wasn't no reason to beat the crap outta me. Sorry, Your Honor. Beat me half to death. But Mr. Willingham's propensity for violence also found its way into his home. Busted lip, black eyes... bruises all over her legs. Oh, and a red mark on her stomach where he kicked her. Now, Mrs. King... did she say what she believed the cause of those beatings to be? Yes, sir. Stacy was pregnant and Todd wanted to make her have a miscarriage. Is Cathy King's testimony correct? -No, sir. -So, Todd didn't beat you up when he found out you were pregnant and tried to force you to abort? No, sir. He even came with me to the doctor when I was pregnant with them twins. He was excited it might be a boy. So, the testimony we've heard about the beatings, the obscenities? I'm not saying Todd and I didn't fight, but I gave him just as many bruises as he gave me. Is it true that the police were called to your home to control a situation where Todd Willingham was intoxicated and calling you a, quote, "Whore, bitch, and slut?" Yeah. We was always arguing, it didn't mean nothing. People argue. Despite the many occasions that he behaved in such a violent manner, how can you be so sure that he didn't commit this crime? Because he loved those babies. And he loves me. Mrs. Willingham, are you telling us that all of these witnesses who have testified to your husband's violent abuse of you are just lying? I don't know. Do you have any idea why they would lie? No. Now, you were raised by your grandmother. Your mother was a victim of family violence, wasn't she? Mm-hmm. Can you tell us what happened to her? Objection. -Irrelevant, Your Honor. -Overruled. The witness will answer the question. Mrs. Willingham? She was... I'm sorry. Can you speak up, please? She was killed. By your father? Yes. No further questions. You don't understand, Todd is not like that. Todd would never do anything to hurt those babies. He loved those babies with all his heart. He treated those babies better than anybody else did. He would feed them and change their diapers, and he potty-trained them, and you are not listening. -The witness will step down. -Everybody in here making up lies, no one's paying attention to the fact, no one's telling the fucking truth! -The witness is excused. -No one accepts the truth or listening to anything we're saying. - Young lady-- -When do we get a chance to say the truth? - You will step down. -I'm sorry, Todd. I'm sorry. Mr. Horton, call your next witness. -Your Honor, the defense rests. -Are we all clear -on what was just said then? -Todd. Now, hold on a minute. Before they started digging up her past, -y'all were clear on that. This is the worst kind of crime there is. And there's been people called up to this stand to lie about me, people who just don't like me anyway. I just wanna make sure I get a fair trial, Judge. I wash my hands of this, Your Honor. Ain't that how this shit works? Now, I've sat here and stayed quiet while y'all paint the worst possible picture of me. Ain't I got a right to respond, Judge? Well done, son. Well done. -Sit down. Sit down. -Where are my friends? - Mr. Jackson.... - Where are my family? -...call your next witness. -People who can vouch for me. Sir, you need to calm down, sir. The jury will disregard what they just saw and heard. Mr. Jackson, proceed with your summation. "Whosoever shall harm one of my children, it is better for a millstone to be hung around his neck and for him to be cast into the sea." Members of the jury, I ask that the words of Mark 9:42 remind you of your responsibility... as they remind me of mine. Two days before Christmas, Willingham committed the ultimate crime. Can there be a more righteous case for the imposition of the ultimate penalty? Now, whether capital punishment, in this case, will deter others, I don't know, but I do know it will deter Cameron Todd Willingham. And that is what the State of Texas is asking you to do today. Willingham wrote his own death sentence when he killed those children. It is your duty to carry it out. Sit down, boy. Only been 40 minutes. Liberation could take days. Jury is coming in. Has the jury panel reached a verdict? Yes, sir. Would you pass it to the bailiff? Will the defendant rise? By your verdict in this case, you, the jury, have found the defendant, Cameron Todd Willingham, guilty of the offense of capital murder, as charged in the indictment. Cameron Todd Willingham, by order of the State of Texas, -you are sentenced to death. This is Tower 4. I got eyes on our boy on the dog run. Hey, hey, what's up, homie? - Fuck you, get inside - All right, baby killer. Now, this here is general population. Get yourself a good hard look because you ain't never gonna see a crowd again, boy. Hey, baby killer. Like killing babies? Little bitch. You-- Back up! Oh, you're a sweet one. You're gonna get yours, baby killer. That's it, all right. The long walk to the death chamber. The condemned, that's you, baby killer, can have his family there, at least what's left of them in your case. Ha-ha. You're gonna see it again, I promise. -Welcome to death row. Yeah, I know you're listening, baby killer. You wanna know what's coming, you all do. It could be days. Shit, it could be years, but somehow you guys -are always so surprised. - Your move. It happens just after your last meal. You can order any damn thing you want. I've seen one poor guy ask for candy. What about you, baby killer? What's your poison? Oh, poison! Injection. You get it? Get your ass in there. -Unhook him. - Let's go. First, we strap your ass to that table, and then one of us puts in the IV. Of course, we don't always get it right. Sometimes the fella lays there just screaming in agony for hours, begging to be put out of his misery. What if I'm innocent? Nobody ever done it, baby killer. No, it was their best friend who done it, or... he didn't know the gun was loaded, or... he was just trying to scare 'em. But, damn, you, you just stood there and watched them babies burn. Now, that's cold. That's what I'm gonna do for you, baby killer. I'm gonna stay there and watch. And when they pump that shit inside of you... you are gonna burn from the inside out. A-107. Hey! You that Willingham fella? You the boy that burned them babies? Hey, we got something special for you. Up through there. Hey, it's the baby killer. -What's up, bitch? Stop, face the wall. You get one shower every two days, that's it. We got a fight in the shower block. - Hey, come here, boy. - Get him. Don't you fucking move. You got him? Are we good? Let's see how you like some alone time, boy. Son of a bitch can bleed. Ain't too pretty anymore. -Make him your bitch. Pick his ass up. -Piece of shit. -Come on, get up. "I'm sorry, boss", say it. Say it. "I'm sorry, boss." Say it. What the fuck for? Y'all are treating me worse than a damn animal! I wouldn't even treat my dog like this. Get the fuck out of here, Todd. Go back to the bar and find some girl to suck on your dick. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here, Todd. Who are you cheating on me with, bitch? Everybody in the fucking town. -What's his name? -The fuck up. You fucking whore. Come on, Todd, that's enough. Come on, baby. I love you so much, you know that. See, you're not so bad. -Come on, baby, it's okay. -Don't you move. Come over here, baby. Come on. We both fucked up and... you fucked up too. Daddy! Daddy! Help! Help me! Y'all, take me out of here. I promise I won't do anything bad again. I promise I'll be good. Mr. Daniels, may I have a pen and paper? Say please. May I have a pen and paper, please? May I have a pen and paper, please, sir? Dear Stacy, I don't understand why you won't come visit me. I've had a lot of time to think about our life together. "It already feels like so long ago." Him again. What's he want now? Grandma, lay off. "I have not been good. I suppose I'm paying for that now. But why sh... Why should I be punished for a thing I did not do? You know I would never hurt those babies." You tell him to leave you be. He was a wicked child that became a wicked man. And if you'd figured that out a little sooner, I might still be a grandmother. If he killed anybody, it would have been me. You know what, I'm gonna write a letter to Governor Anne Richards and tell her how much he loved his little girls. Well, that's just great, Stacy. I'm gonna go write a letter to Santa. That's my favorite, Stacy. Oh, yeah? What a surprise. Who was that? You just look real nice this time of day. Thank you, Todd. Wrote you a song. Oh, yeah? How does it go? -Wanna hear it? -Sure, why not? ♪ Don't go to work ♪ Don't put on your shirt ♪ Leave it alone That little skirt ♪ ♪ Come back to bed ♪ Give a little head ♪ We can spend our whole life Rolling in the dirt ♪ -Do you like it? -I like some parts of it. -Which parts of it do you like? -Take a wild guess. Rolling in the dirt? Before that. Part where you're nice and sweet-- What are you doing, Todd? Come on, you're just trying to show off. One more time, come on. -I gotta go. -Come on. You're like a 12-year-old boy. I give in. Dear Stacy, I don't understand why you won't answer my letters. I know you can never get over what happened, but I lost everything, too. Not just the kids and you and our home, but pretty soon now, my life. - All right, walk. -They have given the needle to at least one of us every month since I've been here. God bless you, brother. Hang in there, bro. We'll be praying for you. Be strong. I'd like to believe that even in a terrible place like this there may be some good. But all I see is cruelty and suffering. Everybody pretty much hates it the same. ...And we will be raised in pairs. And death will be swallowed in victory. - Come here. - Where's your victory? Death, where is-- will you let me fucking walk? -Will you let me fucking walk? -Chill the fuck out. Let me walk like a fucking man. Stand tall, bro. Oh, God! Oh, God! Let me fucking walk, you bastard! Hey, baby killer! Baby killer! Hey, white boy. Yo, asshole! What's your problem, man? I'm talking to you. You think I'm stupid or something, boy? Boy? -Come again? -If I say anything to you, you're gonna start saying I confess some shit, get a reduced sentence, fuck that! Hey, listen good, sugar. They get you here, they got you good. Confession make you feel better? Huh, sweet thing? All right. I knocked over a jewelry store. Kind of hit a leak. Oh, God. He reached under the counter for a piece and I shot him in the head. I was high. And I am guilty, but murder one, shit, that is manslaughter at the most. But this is Texas. You know why they call it capital punishment? Huh? Hey, you ain't got no capital, you get punished. -That's right. - Shit. Now, don't tell me that ain't your story too, because I know that sorry ass, state-appointed lawyer of yours. Huh? Plumbers ain't no different from lawyers. There's good ones and there's bad ones. But you know what, poor folks always get the bad ones. Just like my granddaddy always said, everybody gets the same amount of ice, except rich folks get it in the summer. Of course, you could try to become a cause célèbre or some such shit. Might even be worth some publicity. You can get you one of them fancy pants, white shoe boys willing to do it for free. By the end, who knows if you got enough time left to make a difference. -Hold up. - What? You saying I can get me a new lawyer with no money? Yeah, boy. Now, you just write up a letter about your situation and send it to the Texas Equal Justice and that should do it. That's initiative. I-N-I-T-I-A-T-I-V to the E. T-I-V to the E. So, you say your previous counsel, failed to capitalize on numerous opportunities to reach the prosecutions' witnesses? Or to present any viable alternative to their theories of your culpability? He did a shit sorry job. Sold you down the river. This is your trial transcript. And just a few books, might be helpful. Homework. I'm preparing a writ of habeas corpus, also known as "The great writ." We're allowed to present new evidence, if we can find some, that is. Do you have any, you know, resources to help us? Someone who'll pay for a private investigator? Your wife or family? -No, sir. -All right. Well, we'll figure something out. We need to find something in your trial that demonstrates negligence. That's harder to do once you've been convicted. I need you to go through the transcript and find anything questionable. Okay, can you do that? I think I'll squeeze it into my very hectic schedule. This writ could be your last chance. And a slim one at that. Hey, Metallica. I can practically hear you reading. Give that a rest, let me beat you at Crazy Eights. This is making my head hurt. They make it that way on purpose. Keep out dummies like us. There's some crazy ass words in here, bro. -Contemptuous, colloquially. - Spell that shit -without looking. -Analogous. -Did I even say it right? -Meticulous. -Uh-huh. Interwoven. Now, I'm gonna drop some knowledge for you. That first appeal, it might not go nowhere. They ain't gonna overturn their hunting buddy's conviction. You might have a chance with the Fifth Circuit. What about this Supreme Court shit? You kidding? If it leans any more to the right it'll tip over. These books keep talking about justice like it's something real. Man, there ain't no justice in the system. And there ain't none in this life, either. You know, why was I born black? Hmm? Yeah, black as hell. And why was y'all born poor and stupid? Can't I be born poor and smart? No, man, it's a lie, bro. What if somebody really is innocent? It ain't got nothing to do with it. Death penalty's good politics. As a matter of fact, in an election year, they always kill twice as many of us. That's politics for your ass. -For real? -Yeah. Your candy ass politicians feel like real men killing folks. Take your hand, bro. -Right on, brother. Stay strong! Second and five, ball on the 38th. Hand off to Smith... -Go! -Come on, baby. Come on. -Go! -Yeah, do it! -Run! Run, boy! -Go right there. -Run, boy! -That's gone, right there! Yeah! Dallas Cowboys, touchdown! And the Cowboys take the lead for the first time. Woo! Heck yeah! They don't know about that Southern ground, baby. -Come on, let's go! -I got you. How about them boys? Hey. Thanks for covering my shift. -Yeah, you owe me, bitch. -Oh, man. You would've skinned my ass alive on this Becky party. We had a clown, a cake, the whole nine fucking yards. I was serving ice cream to little princesses. -It was pretty good. -Get out of there, Willingham. -Yeah, boss. -Hurry up. Hurrying up, boss. I'm in a real hurry. Real hurry to go do nothing. You fucking listening to me, baby burner? -What? No-- -Huh? Yes, boss, I was. -You fucking pervert. -Take it easy, he's on my watch. I don't give a shit. I don't want his sicko ears on my kids. Look at me, why you so fucking interested in my life, huh? Come on, man. Let's go. Sunday was my daughter's birthday, too. I woulda killed the motherfucker. What are they gonna do, put you on death row? He's just a screw, Ponch. Probably got picked on at school. Says he's got a daughter. Ponch. Ponchai. What's up, Ponch? I... I got my date today. They're moving me to the observation cell. Scared I'm gonna kill myself. Shit, Ponch. It is what it is. Shit, I'm thinking... uh... two orders of onion rings to go with my chicken fried steak. Smothered in Texas pea. One of them, you know, strawberry milkshakes. Shit. I'm gon' throw up all over the damn place. Lord, give me the courage to take my... No, no, no, let go off me. Get off me, get off me! Come on! It's not my time yet, man! It's not my time! No! No! Not yet! Let's go, brother. Let's go, brother. -I can't do it. No, man. -Yes, you can, Ponch. You can. -No, I can't. -Yes, you can, brother. Stand tall now, brother. -No! -Let's go, Ponch. They don't get this work. That's two for you, baby. - Hey, it's Ponchai! - Ponchai James. - It's all you, brother! -Ponchai Ja... Ponchai James! He's the man! Let's go, Ponch. -Let's go, brother. - Ponchai James. -All right. - Go, baby. Ponchai James. Oh, they gonna remember you, Ponch. Ponch! ♪ I've been around the block A time or two ♪ ♪ Done almost everything A boy can do ♪ ♪ I've done some living Yeah, I've had fun ♪ ♪ But there is one thing That I haven't done ♪ ♪ I want to know how Forever feels... ♪ Hey. You need some help? So, are you from around here? Why'd you stop back there? Oh, I didn't think you were dangerous. Figured I could take you one on one. You weren't scared? -What? -You weren't scared? Of you? Why? Why not? I guess I just didn't think about it. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Can't you stay a moment more? You might be just the kind of person we're looking for. Oh, you're scared now? Well, I'm a little weirded out, to tell you the truth. -What you want from me? -Your address. -What for? -I wanna send you something. Oh, you don't need to send me anything. Well, I wanna return the favor. I think you and I were intended to meet. So, was she, like, a crazy person or-- Why did she want your address? Well, she said somebody might wanna write me a letter. -Who? -A prisoner. -What? -Nothing. - What? -Just classic Liz. -Oh, here we go. -The abandoned kittens, the homeless family at the truck stop. Oh, my God. The starving African kids on TV. -Okay. Gullible, bleeding heart. -Oh, I'm not saying that. You called me St. Liz for a decade. Well, that's not what I think. We're well past lying, George, aren't we? So, yesterday, I got a letter. -Hey, Mom. -Hey, girl, how was school? Earth to Julie. -Sorry? -Never mind. -Love you. -Love you, too. And it said, "Dear Ms. Gilbert, I got your address from TCADP. I was told that you might be willing to correspond with someone such as myself." What is that, the TAD, whatever? TCADP. Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. How'd you get involved in that? The lady who asked for my address. -You don't listen to me. -No, I was listening. -What did he do? -Never mind. Oh, come on, Liz Come on. Why is he on death row? He... He burned down his house with his kids inside. -That's charming. -All right. Here. So, why exactly are you doing this? I didn't say I was doing it. But you're thinking about it. Well, can't I just not know? I don't know. Isn't looking after one person with a death sentence enough? -I'm sorry. So, are you and the kids okay? Money and everything. -Yeah. -Well, if you need anything, -just... -Your check comes on time. And we talked all that out. -I failed you, Liz. And yet, you're here for me. If thing's were the other way around, would I be there for you? Do we get off that sow or just admit the truth? How are you... really? -Mama, you forgot the milk. -I'm going to the market later. -Okay. -Mom, what are reading there? -Letter from a guy in jail -who kills babies. -Julie. What, are you writing a play about him or something? No, sweetie, there's a man who is in prison-- -He wants Mama to visit him. -Seriously? A lot of people visit inmates, and I'm not saying that I'm-- You know they're gonna poison him to death, right? -He deserves it. -You got somewhere to be, like, school, and maybe clean your mess up? Mama, I know what the death penalty is-- I can't believe you're actually thinking about visiting a murderer. -I didn't say-- -That is so gross. I didn't say he was innocent. -Okay, then what are you saying? -He's a human being. Okay, I'm late. Dave's gonna drop me. So, are you seeing your dad, later? No, the Gremlins will be there. Well, they are your brother and sister. What? Fine. I'll go. All right. Am I getting you later? No, Dave's gonna drive me. Well, will you call me, please, miss? Mom, I got soccer practice till 6:00 -and I'm taking the bus. -Okay, well I thought -I was getting you. - Bye. What about oatmeal? Death row inmates aren't allowed to associate with the general population. We have no contact at all with the outside. No one in the whole world knows I exist. I feel like I'm slowly being erased. Please excuse my writing, I'm learning to express myself better. I've added your name to my visitor's list in case you decide to come. Meantime, I hope your life turns forever forward. Yours, Cameron Todd Willingham. Hello, sir, I'm here to see Cameron Todd Willingham. Come, miss. Thank you for coming, Mrs. Gilbert. It's really nice to meet you. Oh, nice to meet you too, Cameron. Folks call me Todd. Oh, yeah? Todd. I really appreciate you coming all this way. -You're in Houston, right? -Yeah. -How was the drive? -Oh, it was fine. Well, some traffic, you know, Houston Freeway has become... crazy. You know, you're my first visitor in a long time. Am I? Well, good. I guess. And why is that? -I... -I mean, your wife comes? No, Stacy and me ain't together no more. Oh... I guess I understand, it's just... I miss her, is all. Sorry. How about your folks? They're in Oklahoma, ma'am. It's 200 miles each way. And my folks is old. And my mom's ailing, so... They come when they can. Well, how about you tell me about... your life here, what it's like or... -Not much to tell, really. -Mm, right. Any comforts or, I don't know? In jail? No, ma'am. I'm sorry, Todd. I don't know-- I don't know... what to ask or how to... If I-- If I-- If I make it harder to talk. No, ma'am. How about you? Tell me about the outside world. Maybe I can get out of this place for a while. Oh, all right, sure. But maybe you call me Elizabeth, because when you say ma'am, it makes me feel like you're talking to my mama. -Elizabeth. -Okay. Well, um... let's see. -You married? -Me? Divorced, actually. -Kids? -Two. Andrew and Julie. -Boy and a girl. -Yeah. -That's nice. -Yeah, yeah. My big girl, Amber, she'd be 11 by now. And Karmen and Kameron, they'd be nine. They was twins. Twins? Oof! -That's something, huh? -Yes, ma'am. Elizabeth. Oh, you ever tried diapering two at once? -No. -Oo-ee. Stacy used to say it was like trying to grab a hold of two little greased piggies at the state fair. Oh, they was the most beautiful babies in the whole world. They're all different, but cut from the same cloth. Now, Kameron, she was smart. She had, like, a routine that she stuck to. And if anybody disturbed it, and she didn't like it, she would let the whole of Texas know about it. Karmen, she was-- She was more like me. And Amber, she was a great big sister. She went from redecorating her sister's room to... turning around to me one time, and saying, "Daddy, I love the new babies, but when are they going home now?" Gosh, I tell you I wanna hear about the world and I end up doing all the talking. Oh, that's fine. Well, I'm sorry. I guess, it's just been a while. How long has it been? -Eight years. -Hey. We're pretty much at the end of the line now. You scared, Todd? I did not kill my own children, Elizabeth. I swear. I love them more than I love life itself. - Time's up. It was weird. He was gentle and soft spoken. Oh, that's because he wants to get in your pants. -You know that's true. -That's rude. And he was a devil worshiper to boot! No! -No. -No, I heard it right on the TV. He burned up those babies as a sacrifice to Satan himself. Seriously? Girls, you're getting out of control. If anybody were to come near my babies, I got a .38 Colt by my bedside with their name on it. The idea of you with your loaded .38 makes me wanna move out of the neighborhood. Let's get started. Are you gonna use some of this for your new play, as if... -Oh, I don't know. -Fascinating. Liz, wha-- What if somebody was trying to hurt your babies? I'd do anything. -See? -That's not the point. -Of course, it is. -It's still taking a life. A monster who don't deserve to live. It's just revenge. I mean, are we still there? Isn't that a primitive idea? No. It's called restitution. Let the punishment fit the crime. Okay, well, you better kill your ex-husband. Oh, wouldn't that be great? Liz, don't become one of those sad women we hear about, -who falls in love with-- -Me? I'm just saying. Thank you so much for your interest in my love life. But don't worry, even someone as desperate as me knows that a death row romance doesn't have a future. Hey. Dad died. Dear Elizabeth, I didn't get a chance to express my deep gratitude for your visit. It lifted my spirits for days. Sir? I used to be full of hate. Hate for the judge, hate for the jury. Hate for everyone who mistreated me and wanted me dead. I guess after all this time, the hate just kinda burned out of me. I've been working hard on my case and... it's funny, I'm no longer the same dumb 24-year-old who lost his place in the world... and have achieved more learning within these walls than I ever did in school. I can remember every word of our conversation. You're the kind of person I never had the chance to meet. An artist, filled with intellectual ideas, and worldly wisdom. "For me, it was more than a connection to a world. It brought my heart to laugh, and created an omni-potent glow around my being." Sounds like he's prepping for the SATs. Mm-hmm. Well, first of all, it's omnipotent. And secondly, maybe he's just trying to improve himself. I mean, there's other people we know who might wanna, like, -study for the SATs. -I'm studying! You wanna visit him again? Is this like a... a thing? I might. Why? I don't know, honey. You know, when you just wanna do something... help... somebody who's feeling... so much, you know? I don't know what I'm saying. Am I making any sense? Honestly... not really. I cannot believe you came back. I sure did. Look at you. So pretty. You don't have to say that, Todd. Are you kidding me? Look at your hair, your eyes, your dress, everything's just... mm-mm, singin' to me. Okay. Stand up for me. Just give me a twirl. -What? -Come on, now. Just once. Now, come on. No. How you been? Liz, last time you came, I was the one who did all the talking. How are the kids? Julie and Andrew, right? Yeah. They're okay. Hmm. I told you their ages? No. -Um, Julie is 17. -Uh-oh. Super smart. She's a great kid, but... she's a pain in my butt sometimes. -Oh, my Lord. Well, you wouldn't wanna know me when I was 17. -Believe me. Uh-uh. -Oh, no kidding? -And Andrew? -Best freckles known to man. -Is he breaking hearts? -On the cusp. They get to see their daddy much? What's wrong? Their dad died a couple of weeks ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I guess, we both know what it is to lose something now. I wrote a poem about my babies. It's pretty bad. You wanna hear it? Sure, of course. It's bad. "I know their beauty flows deep within. And all that's broken their love will mend. This beauty of theirs is so unique. It's much more valuable than priceless antiques." Nice. -Fucking terrible, huh? It's terrible. All sections, call count, five minutes, clear your ranks, clear the cages. You're a Cowboys fan, right? Yeah. You think Aikman and Irving have still got it? You almost done? It's fucking freezing out here. Figured out why you're always pissed. Yeah, why's that? Because you're a prisoner here, too, like me. You ain't bottom of the pile. You ain't top of the pile, neither. You're just kinda middle of the pile. -Now, in order to feel like you're going somewhere in the world, you got to stand on the likes of me. But don't really get you anywhere, you just kinda stay in the middle. Yeah? You my fucking therapist now? I just got a lot of time on my hands is all. You ever read Man's Search for Meaning? I was absent that day. It's by Viktor E. Frankl. -Okay. -Yeah, the guy basically says... "To live is to suffer. And to survive, you got to find meaning in the suffering." I made a promise to my daughter. She visits me sometimes. You got a daughter too, right? What's her name again? Becky. Let's go inside. No need to cuff your bitch ass. Are you sure? I'm feeling dangerous, brother. -Yeah, you ain't got shit. How you been? Yeah? Been doing much? This is you. Don't really look like you, though, huh? I might have to give her a haircut. Are you seeing your sisters? They good? Are you mad at me? Are you mad at me? You still see them? Yeah, you taking care of them? Yeah? You gonna tell them you saw Daddy? You gonna tell them I'm sorry? You know I didn't do it, don't you? Well, Todd, you want to hear about my life, so here goes. You probably didn't want this much detail, but you did say you wanted to know everything. Mornings are tough. Morning. Teenagers think they can stay up all night. Then they seemed surprised when they have to wake up for school. I probably coddle them too much, but that's my right as a mother. Well, it's just me now. I guess I want them to know I'm there for them. Hey, hey, didn't you need me to sign that signature page for you? But I tell you... sometimes that hour between 6:00 and 7:00 in the morning feels about five minutes long. -Lunch. Is that enough, though? -Yeah. -Give me a hug. -Bye, Mama. Love you. Love you. -Love you. -Bye, now. Eat today. Most days I try to write. Recently, not so much. As good as my life is... I can't help think of all the plans I had that never happened. I know that sounds spoiled to someone in your situation. But you said you want the truth. Dear Elizabeth, I cannot thank you enough for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. I never really looked deeply into myself before we started writing... Dear Todd, I got your drawing. That is so beautiful. You say you wanna know what my life is like. Well, try staying in your kitchen for an entire day. Then think about what it'd be like to be there for the rest of your life. Regular prisoners talk about doing time, but on the row, there is no time. The clock stopped moving the minute we were sentenced. People say we should all live life like it could be taken away at any moment. Death catches most people unawares. You're asleep, or your body shuts down, or an accident happens, but to live every moment, waiting, knowing that they could decide to kill you at any moment... can't help picturing the dents on the door where others have kicked and fought as they went in. Are you sure you want this one? It's kind of a snooze, and jury was only out for an hour. I got some better ones. -Just this one, please. -All right. -Thanks, sir. -You're welcome. Next. Hey. He wanted to get in so bad, he broke the windows with a tire iron, but the fire just blew that glass back at him. I've never seen a man cry so hard. He didn't try to save those kids until the cops showed up. And it was like he was putting on a show. Don't surprise me, he started that fire. This so-called art hung above Todd Willingham's bed. Dr. Grigson, what can you tell us about it? In my experience, such images of death and violence are often associated with cultive type activities. It is my conclusion that Todd Willingham is a severe sociopath with violent tendencies. Is it true that the police were called to your home to control a situation where Todd Willingham was intoxicated, and calling you a "whore, bitch, and slut"? Todd would do never do anything to hurt those babies. He loved those babies with all his heart. He treated those babies better than anybody else did. Mr. Horton? No questions, Your Honor. Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Horton. Well, you can thank my girl, Ronda. -Yeah? -She told me I had to see you, so you would stop pestering her. Oh, well, I just wanted to get your thoughts on Todd Willingham. So, you knew him before? Oh, yeah. I guess everybody in town knew him, huh? Cross the street to stay out of the way is more like it. Nothing but trouble, that boy. Tell you a little story. Night after Todd's children died, the whole town had a gathering to raise money for their funeral. He acted like he'd just won the lottery. -Drinking, playing darts. Playing and whooping it up. And just because someone acts inappropriately doesn't mean they're a murderer, though, right? You're right. What's inappropriate is taking his part. Now, you seem like an educated woman. He had the motive, he had the means, the science backed it up. What makes you so cock-sure he's innocent? Honestly, I don't know if he's innocent or not. The question is, did he get a fair trial? Let me guess. You've seen Todd and he charmed you. He was quite the ladies' man back in Corsicana. I wouldn't know anything about that. But what I do know, is that you failed to challenge witnesses that changed their story. You failed to reach out to Todd's friends. You failed to find a single scientific expert. I am sorry, sir, but... it seems like you barely tried to create reasonable doubt in the jury's minds. Where did you get your law degree, missy? State didn't give me enough money to feed these horses to defend that boy. -But I did the best I could. -Yeah? Yeah. And regardless of your estimation of my professional abilities, the fact remains, that boy is a monster, and he will die. Worry about the living, Ms. Gilbert. Yeah, well, maybe, you should do the same. We clearly have enough to file an appeal with the Fifth Circuit. Now, I'm sorry, sir, but this Horton seems like a complete loser. I mean, he decided Todd was guilty from the get-go. Yeah, granted Todd's trial was a horror show, but it doesn't mean he's innocent. But, then, what about his appeal? Ms. Gilbert, I appreciate your zeal. I worked this case for six years, and got nowhere. There's so many others that needed my help who I can help. -But, then, what if-- -They denied him habeas corpus. You're asking the state to reopen a case based on character witnesses, when the primary factor in this conviction was the arson investigation. Now, I have to agree with the experts here, Ms. Gilbert. Fire does not lie. Look, you've been kind to him, and I admire that. A personal involvement can blind you to the truth. I've been there. Just don't let your emotions get the better of you. My emotions? What? 'Cause I'm a woman? That's not what I meant. Well, then, why don't you enlighten me? Have sympathy for the man he's become, don't forget about the man he was. Great. I'mma go finish your job for you. Hold on a sec. Look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but it's just, it's been a long road for me on this one, and I got to let it go at some point. But you know what? I've been reading this one file. This Johnny Webb character, and his testimony seems like a complete lie. I mean, is there a way we can get to him? Hey! Hey! Hey, how's it going? Are you from one of those church groups? No, uh, Judge Powell called you, right? Yeah. Yeah, I've been... talking to some people about Todd Willingham. Sounds familiar. Yeah, you, talked to the court about how he confessed to you... about starting a fire that killed his daughters. Right. Yeah, now I remember. It was sad. Real sad. Yeah, I've been reading your testimony, carefully. Just wondering how all that happened. It's a long time ago, you know. Yeah, I can't remember last week. But it sure would help if there's anything you could tell me. Well... Uh... I was just sitting in my cell. You know? And... And this guy gets put in with me. He's talking for a while and... he confessed to me right there. -That's about it. -Just like that? You felt like you knew Todd well, or... Like I said, we shared a cell, so, you know. Why do you think he confessed to you? I guess he just needed to tell somebody. You know? Sometimes a stranger's good for that. How's that work? When you testify in somebody else's case, they, um... give you a reduced sentence or... did things change? You're a welder, huh? -Guess so. -My dad, too. Is that what you wanted to do? Underwater welder, actually. -The coolest job. -Is that what you are now? -I wish. I took a course, though, been studying and shit, you know, I took it down in-- Don't tell me, Houston? -Houston. Yeah. -At The Ocean Corporation? Yeah, damn right. They got everything in there. -It's expensive. -Yeah, you ain't kidding. -That's far from here, too. -Yeah, you know. -Drove my truck, though. -This one? -Yeah, yeah, that's my baby. -Now, that is-- That's sweet. Almost got it new, too. Why are you asking me about all this? How did you pay for this? Oh! I know what I wanted to ask you. Did Jackson, the district attorney... did he promise you a reduced sentence for that little story you told? -I don't know. I-- -Did he do that to you? -I don't know. -Like promise to take care of you? They do that? You know, I don't wanna talk no more, so... I'm sorry, Johnny, but... was that the deal? Yeah, but I ain't supposed to talk about this stuff, so-- Who told you not to talk about it, the district attorney is asking you not to talk, and they're using you-- It's time for you to leave, lady-- Listen to me, they are gonna kill an innocent person. And then you have to live with it? -I'm done here! -They're gonna kill an innocent man and you have to live with it? You know, I got a gun. -All right. We're just talking. -I'm done talking. Okay. All right, I'm not a cop. -Get the fuck outta here then! -Okay. You could help. Please. He threatened you? That stupid motherfucker, he threatened you? Mm-hmm. Listen to me, his story stinks. You know why? That guy's a snitch. I think the DA paid somebody to pay him off. -He took a bribe? -Mm-hmm. Oh, he's a spineless piece of shit. But do you understand what that means? We got a snitch, a gas can that was never found -and Stacy's testimony. -Yeah. Look at all this evidence. Reeve says there's no problem. We've got plenty to go. File an appeal with the Fifth Circuit. Fifth Circuit. I already spent five of my appeals, Liz. -I only got one more left. -But you got one more left. It's gonna go the same way as all the others. Todd, you've got one more. Do you think life is fair, Liz? Hell no. Do you think God is all right with that? I don't think we know what His plan is. I don't even try to begin to imagine. I wanna live. That's why we're not gonna give up for one second. Okay? So, life isn't fair. What are we gonna do with that? I mean, maybe this, right now... is the best we get. Us being here for each other. Knowing how wrong it all this. Maybe this is the God part. All of us down here trying to figure it all out. That's beautiful, baby. Is this our house? Is that Mommy? Is she crying? She crying because I was mean to her? Is this Daddy? Daddy was bad, huh? I'm sorry, baby. The doctor who testified that Todd was a sociopath never even met him. That seems unfair. Exactly. Yeah. They bring him in whenever they want a guaranteed death penalty. His nickname is Dr. Death. -Dr. Death? -He... He was expelled from the American Psychiatric Association "for making diagnosis without meeting defendants." This is why you read everything. I swear I'm gonna cook for you tomorrow night. -That is just pitiful. -I like cold pizza. I do, too, but at least put it on a plate. Hey, you. Juls, did a Dr. Hurst call when I was out? Nope. Bye. -Where you headed? -Studying. With Dave? You mean you actually know his name? What? Look... What? I know how amazing it must be being pen pals with a murderer... but it's like you think you're some kind of hero or something. Do you even know that Andrew is crying himself to sleep at night because he misses Daddy? You have no idea what's going on around here. I do. You don't. That's just not true. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweet pea. Dallas is now inside the field goal range on the Arizona 37, second down and eight. Cowboys come out of the shotgun. There's a snap. Cardinals coming with the blitz, Huntington scrambling left. -It's picked off again. -Come on. This time by Adrian Wilson. What kind of lame-ass excuse for a quarterback throws three interceptions in the first quarter? Hey, Willingham? Cowboys suck. -Hey, shut the fuck up. -Whoever thought the Cowboys wouldn't make the playoffs -three years in a goddamn row. -Yeah. It sucks. Unbelievable. Well, first of all, we are talking about a man's life. So, now, you're spearheading an effort to prove Todd's innocence? Well, I wouldn't say spearheading, but I am helping his lawyer. Todd's trial was a complete travesty. What a great ball game... Hey, Willingham. They're talking about you on the radio. Hey, Todd, change the station, man. Which frequency are we on? It's 1060. ...knew that I was going to supposedly meet a killer, but... I found myself talking to a vulnerable, sensitive man. He was very easy to talk to. How do you expect to change people's minds who know of Todd's past, that he beat his wife in front of multiple witnesses but-- I mean, have you ever been cruel to someone in your life? That make you a murderer? No. Uh, it was very clear that witness testimony changed from the time they talked to the police, to the time they were in a courtroom. There's new DNA evidence in this case. There may be new fire evidence. There are more questions to answer here. So, what you're telling me is you believe that Todd is innocent? Yes, I am. I believe the State of Texas is about to kill an innocent man. Would you wanna kill an innocent man? There is more than enough evidence for Todd to be granted an appeal. If there's any question... -Hey. -...evidence or any... Your date's been set. February 17th. Now I feel excited. I read something on somebody who's supposed to be, like, the world expert on fires. His name's Hurst. I've got a message to him and found out he lives in Austin. And I just feel like that's what we need. You know, we need an expert who can come in and challenge this absurdity. Liz, I'm not here to be saved. -Well, I'm not-- -I'm not a character in one of your fucking plays or a pretend boyfriend, or someone here to percolate some excitement in your otherwise boring, ex-fucking housewife life. I am here to die. These are my last days, Liz, not yours. And I don't need them filled up with your false hope. Now, I am grateful for all the faith you've had in me. All the work, everything, but it don't matter what truth you find now. It ain't gonna make no difference. I lied, Liz. I lied to you. I lied to everybody. I said I went in straight to the girls' room, which I did. Crawled over to them, burning shit falling on me and smoke everywhere, everything was on fire. I tried to get in, but I couldn't 'cause it was too hot. Amber! I already knew that they... I was too afraid to... I was too afraid to see my own kids burning to death. I wanted to go back in, but I couldn't 'cause I was too afraid. So I am guilty. Any man who can't save his own kids don't deserve to live. He wants to stop. Maybe he's right. Maybe we're just torturing him. I mean, what chance have we got honestly? Doesn't matter. How many think... You think this is just about Todd? System doesn't work, it's broken. How many others out there you think been fucked over? Yeah. For a while there, we was crazy in love. And then we got married after the twins was born and... I thought that meant he really loved me, but... now I think he was just doing it for them. Well, Stacy, if there's anything you can remember that we could use to save him... this is it. They're about to kill him. I know that, yeah. Please help us. My brother, he's police. He says, Todd gets off, they're gonna come after me and persecute me and Todd's gonna help them do it. I don't wanna go to jail instead of him. That's crazy. Todd loves you. He talks about you all the time. You need to go see him. Mm-mm. I can't do that. Stacy, he was the father of your babies. And he's changed. Please, just go see him. -Hey, honey. -Oh, hey, Mom. Hey, a doctor left you a message. -Doctor Hu-- -Hurst? -Yeah. -Oh, my God. Wait. Mom, is everything okay? Yeah, buddy, not that kind of doctor. -All right. -Have a great day. -All right. -Okay. We're so grateful that you're willing to dive in like this. I mean-- What's your sign? -Excuse me? -Under what sign of the zodiac were you born? -Aries. -And your horoscope, do you read it? -Sometimes, I guess. -Sometimes it's right -and sometimes it's wrong. -Well, all that stuff is just... People have always been fascinated by the stars, they chartered their movements. They could tell you when Mercury was retrograde or when Mars was aligned with Venus. They made predictions based on these observations. These people were called astrologers. They were the experts on the solar system. Until the science of astronomy came along and proved their ideas to be nothing but bullpucky. I've studied the report their experts wrote. Follow me. -Move your feet. -Oh! What do you see? Oh... -nothing? -Exactly. No burn signature. And no such thing as crazed glass either. The spider pattern happens... when it's hit by cold water from the fire hoses. -Ah! I spent two days going over every detail of this case. Thing about investigators is they tend to find what they're looking for, even if it isn't there. They'd already decided Todd was guilty before they walked into that house. They were so sure it was arson, they didn't even bother to check the space heater. Whoever installed the electrical wiring had never even heard of a Safety Code. - Girls? - Those flames ran up the ceiling burning the walls, before moving their way down. Daddy! The fire was what we call a flashover. Instant combustion of everything flammable. The V pattern the experts found... also a signature of a flashover. The accelerant on the porch. Charcoal grill and lighter fluid the expert somehow neglected to mention. My babies are burning up! And the refrigerator that blocked the back door? Linoleum underneath is untouched. It was always there, never been moved. My report is based on hundreds of hours of experiments by the most rigorous scientists in the field, these so-called experts of theirs may have seen lots of fires, but in the end, they're just astrologers. -Thank you, Mr. Hurst. -Thank you so much. There's also just one more thing -that we have to... -What we owe you. I don't believe in astrology, Ms. Gilbert, but I do believe in karma. Mine can use all the help it can get. The pleasure's mine. Todd, we got Hurst. Listen to me. We got to Hurst. We got to him. He said there's no way that fire was arson. You know what that means? If there's no arson, there's no crime. -Can you believe it? -No, I can't. -Oh, my God. -It's just like I've been saying the whole time. Well, Reeves is on his way to Parole Board right now. He said there's no way they won't regard this as exculpatory evidence. Todd, we have a real chance. Oh, I don't know, Liz. I'm not fixing to start hoping again. Hope is bad. I got 10 days left. If I start hoping again, them 10 days is gonna go by -just like that. -I understand, but I'm hoping. You know what I was ruminating on just now while I was waiting for you? -What? -After all them terrible things I said to you, I thought you'd given up on me. Never. Never. -Irene? -Yes? I need to get this copy of Hurst's report over to the Board of Pardons and Paroles. All right? Second thought, got this. Thank you. Sorry. -Hi, Cindy. -Hi, Skip. I was wondering if you can get this out ASAP? -Sure thing. -Thanks so much. -You have a good one. -You too. This fax just came in from the Parole Board, sir. How can they deny it without reading it? No need-- No, no, no. It's a new interpretation of existing evidence using scientific methods that weren't available then. That constitutes new evidence. How could they not even meet? It-- Hello? Hello? Irene, I want a-- I want a draft in appeal for a 30-day stay of execution. You don't have to shout. There's an intercom, you know. And find out how late the governor's office is open. Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming. How you been? -Good. -Good. You look good. -No, I don't. -Yeah, you do. Them eyes, now. You been wanting me to come here all these years, what's on your mind? Ms. Gilbert says my only chance now is stay of execution from the Governor. I just need a statement from you. I don't think that -I can do that, Todd. -Why not? You know I already wrote a letter to Governor Ann Richards trying to defend you, she didn't respond. You just gotta go to Governor Perry. Otherwise, I don't get my pardon. I've been the only one defending you -this whole time. -What's stopping you now then? A lot of things. Grandma. Do you have any idea how many people don't want me to do that? Well, there's only you. I just don't think that I can do that. -Why'd you come here then? -We were married, -weren't we? I figured I should. -That ain't the reason. I think you feel guilty you never helped me with my case. -Hold on a second. -Where'd all that money go, huh? -What? -All the insurance money I could've used to get me a lawyer? To me trying to survive -and rebuild my life. -To you? Making your hair look nice? -Them nails look expensive. -Yeah. That's where it went. Making yourself look pretty around town. -Wow. -While you cut me off. -Fucked all kinds of idiots. -Oh, you should talk. Do you have any idea the stories I have to sit and listen to, all the girls wanna brag about fucking a guy on death row? It's all true. -It's all true. -Yeah, I know. -They all fuck the baby killer. -Wow. You haven't changed a bit. How the fuck would you know? How the fuck would you know, huh? Because I know you, Todd Willingham. Twelve years, bitch. Twelve years it's taken you to pluck up the courage to come see me. Why didn't you come see me once? Because they told me that you killed my babies! Hey, that's enough. But you know I didn't. You know I wouldn't hurt them kids, Stacy. You know. I spent 12 years thinking about it now. I remember everything. I remember everything, Stacy. And I'm sorry, I apologize if I ever hurt you, but I loved you, Stacy. -Todd, please, stop it. -I loved you. Now, we made three beautiful children. -They're gone-- -No, please stop. ...and I am paying for it now. But I'm just asking this one thing now, please. No. -I'm begging you. -Oh, God. -Just this one thing, please. -I'm sorry, I got to go. Hey. They're... They're moving you closer to the chamber. -You're done, fucker. -Mind the wind, brother. Go gently, my friend. Keep your head up, Todd. - Be strong, brother. - Be strong. Hey, you remember that Hail Mary? Roger Staubach through in the playoffs against the Vikings in '75? Yes, sir. Come on. Down 14-10... 24 seconds left. He just rears back... and lets that baby fly. And somehow, it bounces off the defensive halfback... and right into the hand of Drew Pearson... touchdown Cowboys. Unbelievable. It's what you need, brother. A Hail Mary. I wish I could throw it for you. ...thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now... and at the hour of our death. Amen. For Todd Willingham scheduled to be executed in just five days. This marks the end of a 12-year-old... Hey, you got a pen and paper, or something? Here you go. ...Todd Willingham's fate. This is a town of good and simple people. To whom it may concern. My name is Johnny Webb. I was forced to testify against Mr. Willingham by the district attorney's office and other officials. I'm given no other choice, but to recant my testimony at this time. Mr. Willingham is innocent of all charges. They're gonna take Daddy away now, honey. I don't know. They just say it's my time. I'm gonna miss you too. I'm gonna really miss you. That day in the fire, if I... If I could've just saved you. Amber. Come on, honey. It'll be okay. Just let your brother do all the talking. Ms. Kuykendall, what do you have to share with us? Can you tell us what happened? Can you tell us what happened, please? What would you like to share? Regardless of what's been said in the past, I have here my affidavit. It says Todd confessed to her when she visited him in prison. Texas is doing the right thing making that monster pay for what he did. Come on. That's all we have to say. You know her granddaddy took out an insurance policy on the kids? Cashed it right after the fire. She's terrified. They're all running scared after this Hurst report. I asked my mom and dad not to come. It would be too much for them. Yeah. You know, the report's on the Governor's desk right now. Governor Perry? Yeah. I'm getting scared now, Liz. Not about dying. They said it's gonna hurt, they say it hurts so much. You're gonna be there, right? Promise. Good. I don't wanna die alone. Mama, are you okay? They're gonna kill him tomorrow. I failed. No. I let him down. If I had found Hurst sooner... No, Mama. No, Mama, you didn't. You did so much for him. I guess I thought the right thing would win. I thought the right thing would win. I'm sorry. -I'm so, so sorry. -No, I'm sorry. That you had to learn such a shitty truth about the world. No. Paul, I am telling you the Governor has not read this. Because it's proof. Just please find somebody who will make him read it. - Yo! - Yeah? How long? Hour and a half maybe. Ain't nobody called? I'm sorry, brother. I'm definitely expecting a phone call, boss. -I know. -Elizabeth Gilbert, you let me know the second she calls, right? I promise. You all right? Yeah, I know. Fuck. She's critical, but stable. We're confident she'll pull through. Unfortunately, her neck is broken. We're not sure if she'll ever be able to walk again. They're taking her into surgery now. Shit. It's time. Come on, now, get up. All right. Let's do it. Are you ready? One, two, three. No! No! No! No! She don't have to be here, does she? -It doesn't matter, brother. -My ex-wife. I can't do that. I hope you rot in hell, you bitch! You have any final words, son? Yes, sir. I am an innocent man. Convicted of unspeakably heinous crime, which I did not commit. Twelve years I've been wrongly persecuted... despite me maintaining my innocence. It is my dying wish that my body be cremated. And then my ashes spread across my daughter's graves. From God's dust I came... now, to God's dust I judiciously return. Then the earth shall be my throne. All right then, y'all. Thank you. Hey, groovy lady. I'm wondering where you are. I guess something big must have come up. When you read this, I'll be gone, but I wanted to tell you about this dream I had. Me and my girls are out for a walk or some such. -Can you get me one? -No, not that one. I don't want that one. Get me-- Get me this one. -Good. -I got two. It was one of those cool, fall days. Football weather my daddy used to call it. You got that for me? Today was the last day, yesterday was the last day, today we're doing it, this week, next week... Funny thing is, you were there too. Out for a walk, I guess. Okay. I suppose there's lots of reasons to feel sorry for myself. My greatest regret is not being allowed to be buried beside my girls. But thanks to you, I have tried to make my peace. You showed me that love is always there if you just open yourself to it. You helped me to learn to enjoy the simple blessings of being alive. I only wish I had something to give you in return. Besides my love, always. Yours truly, Todd. Okay. Let's go. Governor Perry, question about Texas. Your State has executed 234 death row inmates, more than any other governor in modern times. -Have you-- Have you struggled to sleep at night with the idea that any one of those might have been innocent? No, sir, I've never struggled with that at all. The State of Texas has a very thoughtful, a very clear... process in place of which when someone commits the most heinous of crimes against our citizens, they get a fair hearing, they go through an appellate process. They go up to the Supreme Court of United States if that's required, but in the State of Texas, if you come in to our state, and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved with another crime and you kill one of our citizens, you will face the ultimate justice in the State of Texas. And that is you will be executed. What do you make of--
