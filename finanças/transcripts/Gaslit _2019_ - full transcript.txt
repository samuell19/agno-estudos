(suspenseful music) (birds tweet) (breaths heavily) (dramatic music) - that everything? - I think so. Olivia, let's just talk about this. - There's nothing left to say. Don't make this harder than it already is. - You can't just kick me out of my own house. - I can. And I am. - This is all mine! Okay, I made this family what it is. You wouldn't have that gallery if I hadn't bought it for you. And let's not pretend you didn't plan this, you and that damn artist. - Don't try to make this my fault. You cheated. - You're leaving? - I don't want to sweetie, but yes. I have to go. - But why, what happened? - Honey, your father and I have decided to get a divorce. - No, mom you can't do that, you can't make him do that that's not fair, dad. Dad you can't go. - It's what's best for all of us. - Where are you going? Can I come see you? - We'll see. - Of course. Wait, what do you mean we'll see? She's my daughter olivia of course she can come, and if you think you can take my money and my daughter, you got another thing coming. - Let's talk about this another time. - I'll be at the cabin I'm only a phone call away. - No (sobbing) you can't go. - I'm sorry, I love you. - I love you. - It's going to be okay. - Wow. Your shading technique has really improved. Jack would be impressed, you been working on it? Honey, I know this is hard, but you need to trust us, it's for the best. - You. - What? - Trust you. You made dad leave, he didn't want to go. - Sweetie, it's going to get better. - Someone's here. - Hey (quiet chatter) - I'm so sorry. (suspenseful music) - your father. (breaths heavily) (door squeaks) - [olivia] we're not open yet. - I'm back. - Jack. - Yeah, I just got into town, I thought I'd stop by and... - It's been... - I know, I fell off the radar there for a bit, but I just kind of needed some time away, you know? But, I'm back now, for good, so. So, how are things? How's hannah? (soft music) - he was on his way to the cabin, drove off the road. Police said he died instantly. I feel awful saying this, but I don't know how I feel about it. - What do you mean? - Lain and I were, he was leaving me. I was really angry with him and now he's gone. - How's hannah handling this? - She blames me for everything, lain leaving, the accident her father did the same thing everything was always my fault. I don't know, maybe hannah's right. - No, no, don't talk like that. She'll come around. - She doesn't leave the house, I barely see her. - Maybe tell her I'm back, maybe she'll come and see me. - Sure. Thanks. Appreciate it. (sighs) where are you staying? - Do you still have that studio old banger (laughs) - yes. Ah, come on. - Wasn't sure how that was going to go. Yeah. It's just like I remember. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You can move in whenever you're ready. - Ah. Thanks olivia. You know, you should have hannah come by, maybe do a lesson with me. Learning to express your emotions through painting, could be therapeutic for her. You know, when I had my hard times the studio work is really what got me through it. Just... - Okay, thank you. I'll give you a call and we'll set something up. - You know, I've got a couple of pieces that I've been working on. I don't know if you have, like room but... - Yeah. I would be honored to show your work. - Yeah? - You were the first person to believe in this place, so. - Thank you. (laughs) you're saving me again. - Sure. - Yeah. - Hi there. Hi. - Hi. - You must be our new neighbor. - Yeah, hi. Olivia. - Aw, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Oh my gosh. - I'm mary. - Hi mary. Sorry about that. - Don't worry about it. It's just some old junk. - Welcome to the neighborhood. - Thank you. - Where are you guys from? - Seattle. - Oh, wow. Us too, just a few months ago. - Wow. Well this is such a beautiful town. A really nice change for my daughter and I. Oh, and here she is. Olivia? - Yes. - This is my daughter sydney. - Hi, I have a daughter about your age, hannah. - Oh, that's so nice. Isn't it syd? We'd love to meet her. - Mom. - She's actually not feeling so well, so. - Aw, that's too bad, well soon then. - Okay. - Mom, I can't get in the back door. - Oh, there's a key under the mat sweetie. Okay? - Well, I better go check on hannah, but good to meet you. - Okay, well it was nice meeting you (laughs) - okay. - You'll have to come over for coffee when we're settled. - Sounds good (laughs) - okay. Bye - bye. (knock on door) - how you doing? What are you looking at? - It's the article about dad's crash. - (sighs) you printed it, huh? - Yeah. I just wanted something physical. To hold. Make it real. Do you think there's any possibility that it wasn't dad that they found? I mean, they couldn't say for sure. - It was him. And I understand. Doesn't feel real to me either. - I just don't want it to be true. (sighs) - it's going to take some time, honey. Let's work all these feelings out, talking with lisa will help. Okay, you can't keep missing your appointments with her. Guess who I ran into at the gallery today. Jack. - He's back? - He is. And he mentioned doing a lesson with you again. Honey, you can't stay in your room forever. And it might be really nice to get out and focus on your art for a while. He's free tomorrow. - I'd rather see jack than go to lisa again. (laughs) - I love you. More than anything. It's going to be okay, okay? It's going to be okay. (piano music) how's it going? - It's going. (camera click) - what's that for? - I like to track my progress. (door closes) - hi, I'm looking for olivia. - That's me, you must be the caterer? - Yeah, I'm gretchen, I just wanted to give you your invoice. Sorry for interrupting. - No worries, thanks for being flexible with opening day. - That's no problem, really. Wow, this is a great space. I can't believe they let you take it over, you must be so excited. - Thanks. - If you have any questions you can reach me at that number there, so. Sorry again for interrupting. I'll see you in a couple weeks. - Okay, thanks. - Bye - bye. (sighs) I like it. I need to get to the store, okay? You all right to wait for jack? - You're leaving? - He'll be here any minute. I'll see you tonight, okay? - Hey neighbor. Hi. - Hey. - You still up for that coffee? - Sure, come over, I will brew us some. - I would absolutely die if I didn't have my caffeine (laughs) so, what brought you and hannah here from seattle? - My husband. - Oh, you're married? I thought you were single and bitter like me. - Widowed, actually. He just passed. - Ah, I am so sorry. - It's okay, you didn't know. - Do you mind if I ask what happened? - A car accident. We moved here to try to fix things, didn't work. - What happened? I'm sorry, it's none of my business. - It's okay. He was seeing this other woman in seattle, so we came here to get away. And it actually worked for a while, and then I got sucked into the gallery and he got jealous of this artist I was working with and accused me of cheating. Made up this whole crazy story, and then shared with me that he was still seeing this other woman. (sighs) - olivia, that's terrible. - So... I made him leave and he was on his way to our cabin and veered off the road. (sighs) - wow. You've been through so much. - I'm worried about hannah, because today's the first day she's left the house since this has all happened. - Erm - sorry. - No, it's okay. - I'm so sorry - it's okay, erm well you know, sydney and I we're going camping this weekend you and hannah should go with us. Give you a chance to get away for a while take in the air. - That's really sweet of you to offer, thank you but my gallery is opening in two weeks, and so I just I don't have the time. - What about hannah? Sydney could use a friend. - That's really sweet of you, but I highly doubt she's ready for that. - Okay, well can't hurt to ask her, right? (laughs) - I'll check with her, thank you I'll let you know. - Okay, sounds good. (laughs) (clock ticks) (sighs) - hey, how was it? - I didn't go. - What? What do you mean? - I was going to, but I realized that I wasn't ready and so I left before jack got there. - Where have you been for the last two hours? - Next door. - Next door? - Yeah. I was with that girl sydney she said she met you earlier. - Yeah. - Her dad died last year and we started talking and it was just really nice having someone who understands. Surprised you even care because you're the reason dad left. - That's not fair. (sighs) you know I think it's great that you've made a new friend and you have someone to talk to but you should have let me know and we should have let jack know. - Sorry. So, sydney and her mom invited me camping. - You don't have to go. - Can I go? - You want to. - Well you said I had to get out of the house, right? - I don't know. They just moved here, we barely know them. - Yeah, but sydney's the only friend I have made since we moved here. And I can't be alone in my room, so. - Okay. But you need to promise me you're going to be very careful. - Yeah, yeah okay. - Hey, will you send me the picture you took of that? - Um, yeah. - Please? - Sure. - Thank you, it's beautiful. - Hey, mom. I'm leaving. - You have everything? - Yeah. - Your cellphone? - Yes. - Okay. I love you. Be safe. - Okay. (dramatic orchestral music) - good morning. - Morning. Does this look straight to you? - Yes, it's perfectly straight. - All right. - But it's upside down. (jack sighs) - what? - Why are you hanging paintings? - Well, I just noticed that you could use some help around here, so. - And you're procrastinating on your own work. - No. No, I picked up a brush. I just felt like a total fraud, so. Hey, what happened yesterday? Is hannah okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry about that. She's fine. She's just not herself since everything, so. I need to check on her, actually. Excuse me. - Sure. (olivia sighs) (phone rings) - [voice on phone] you have reached the voice mailbox of... (olivia sighs) - anything? - No, she's at that age where I can't tell if she's ignoring me or there's no signal. (sighs) I was thinking, the piece you painted for me might be perfect for the show, not to sell, obviously, but just... - yeah, I don't have it. - Where is it? - I sold it, you know. There's too many bad memories. - I get it. It's probably a good thing. - Yeah, probably, so. You want to help me put this right side up? - Yes. - 'cause I don't know what I'm doing. (olivia sighs) (phone whirs) - come on, hannah. Hey, hannah, honey, hope you've had a great time. Can't wait to see you when you get home today. Love you. (car whirs) hey, how was the trip? - Hey. - I didn't know you smoke. - Oh, no, I don't. I found it in the car. My husband's. But the trip was really, really nice. It was really nice to get away. - That's great to hear. Where's hannah? Is she bringing stuff inside, or? - Hannah? - Yeah, hannah, my daughter. She went camping with you. - Olivia, hannah didn't go with us. (eerie electronic music) - what do you mean? - It was just sydney and I. - I watched her get into your car. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you sure it was my car? - I don't know, she told me, she told me she was... - olivia, I'm sorry, but hannah did not come with us. - But you invited her. Both of you invited her, right? - Well, I asked you if you thought she would like to go, but I never heard anything back from you, so... - but then she came home, and she told me that sydney invited her. You invited her, right? - No. - Sydney, did you invite her? - No, it's okay, sweetie. - [olivia] sydney, come on. - It's okay, just unload the car. I'm gonna go with olivia back to her house, okay? - I don't understand. She said she was going with you. I saw her get into your car. - Olivia, sydney did not invite hannah to go with us. She did not get in our car. - But she did. Hannah went and met with sydney. Remember the day we had coffee. - The day we had coffee. - [olivia] yes. - Well, that day, sydney was on the plane back to seattle for her best friend's birthday. - Are you sure? - I dropped her off myself. I mean, is there someone else she would spend time with? A friend? A boy maybe? - She doesn't know anyone else here. Except jack. I'll be back. (suspenseful orchestral music) - where are you going? - The gallery. Where's hannah? - Olivia. - She's not here? - No, no, I haven't seen her. Why? What's going on? - She didn't come back from camping. - Wait, what? - Look, you are the only other person she knows here. Are you sure she didn't stop by? - Yeah, no, no, I mean, she's not here. Hey, why? Olivia, what's going on? Hey. - Hannah. Hannah. - Olivia, hey, hey, she's not here. - Jack, where is my daughter? - I don't know. What's going on? - She went camping with the neighbors, then she never came back. They said they never met her. - Should we call the police? - I don't know, I don't know what to do. - Okay, look, hey, calm down. You know what, we're gonna go talk to the neighbors, and we're gonna make them tell us what happened, what really happened, and if it doesn't work, then we're gonna call the police, okay? - [olivia] okay. - Okay, all right, you want me to come with you? - No, no, she might show up. If she does... - yeah, I'll call you right away. Hey. (dark electronic music) (olivia knocks on door) (door squeaks) - olivia, what are you doing here? How did you get in my house? - Your door was unlocked. - I know I locked that door. - Mom, is everything okay? - It's okay, olivia popped in. - Hey, did hannah ever mention anything about a friend, or a boy maybe? - Olivia, sydney has never met hannah. - Yes, she has. - No, I'm sorry, I've never met her. - Yes, yes, you have. You had a conversation with her. You told her about how your father had passed, and you invited her to go camping. - Olivia, would you like some tea? - You went camping together. You went camping with my daughter. You need to tell me right now, where is my daughter? - Is everything okay? - Everything is fine. Just go to your room. Okay, olivia, you told me you had a daughter, and I did invite you both camping with us, okay? But again, the only person that I ever talked to is you. Look, I know you've been through a lot. It's okay. Anyone in your position would be confused. - It's impossible. - Maybe you should sit down. - Okay. (eerie electronic music) you have to be lying. - Why would I lie? - You went with my daughter, you came back, she didn't. You are lying. - You poor thing. I'm so sorry, olivia. - You are lying to me. - Okay. - I'm calling the police. Detective bruce chambers, it's an emergency. (bruce knocks on door) thank god you're here. - Hey, I got here as soon as I could. What's going on? - Hannah's missing, and I don't know what to do. - Hey, olivia, why don't we have a seat? Why don't you walk me through everything? - Okay, it started when our new neighbors moved in next door. Aren't you supposed to be writing this down? - How long ago was that? - Just a few days ago, and they invited us to go camping. I said I couldn't go because of the gallery. They asked if hannah could go. I wasn't sure, but I said yes. Hannah went. - And then what happened? - And then I saw, the very next morning, I saw hannah get into mary's fully packed car and drive off to the mountains. - And mary's the mom? - Yeah. - Do you think she's home right now? - I don't know, she should be. - All right, why don't you sit tight? I'm gonna go see if I can talk to her. - Okay. (Ticks) (door opens) what'd she say? - She hasn't seen hannah. - She's lying, I know it. - Look, she's got no reason to lie. - What are you talking about? Of course she's lying. - Come with me, please. - God. - Here, why don't you grab your coat? (eerie orchestral music) it's a cold one out there. - It's fine. - Go ahead. - Why aren't we going to the police station? - Just trust me, okay? - Trust you? What do you mean? Take me to the police station now. - Look, olivia, there's somebody that I want you to see. If you want to go to the police station after, I'll take you, but please, for me, just come inside. - Olivia, hi. - Hi. Yeah, we should be at the police station filling out a missing persons report. - I'll give you some time. - Okay, here, yeah? Yeah? Why don't you put on your sweater? It gets a little cold in here. - I'm fine, thanks. - All right, well, okay. Well, it's good to have you back. I was worried last week, when you didn't make your appointment. (eerie orchestral music) - what appointment? - Your therapy appointment. - I didn't have an appointment. Hannah did. What is going on here? - Why don't you tell me how this all started? - I can't tell the story one more time. I need to find my daughter. - Olivia, please, just calm down. - I don't want to calm down. My daughter is missing and no one is helping me, no one. - Olivia, hannah isn't missing. Hannah's dead. - What are you talking about? - Hannah died with layne in the accident. They were both killed on impact. - Why would you say something so awful? - I know this is very difficult to hear and accept, but the more clear I can be, the more shocking to your system it will be, and that is what we need to do. We need to shock you back into reality. - No, we don't. She's alive. I saw her just a few days ago. I saw her. - I know it seems real to you, but you've been experiencing symptoms of disassociation. We've been working through that, but I can see we've had a setback. - Bruce saw her. She was with me the day he told me about layne. Bruce saw her. - Olivia, please. Olivia. - Bruce, tell her, tell her you know hannah's still alive. Please tell her, please tell her you saw her. You saw her, and you know, you know hannah's alive. She's still alive, she's... - olivia, I am so sorry. - No, no, no, I don't believe you. No. - [bruce] hannah is gone. - No! No. - [lisa] olivia, I'm so sorry, olivia. - Stop. No. No. No, no, no. - It's okay. - Olivia? Look, olivia, are you okay? - I'm sorry, olivia needs to rest right now. Lisa's gonna stay with you for a while, okay? She's gonna make sure you're all right. If you need anything, please call me. - I got her, thanks. (thermostat beeps) I'm gonna make you some tea. (burner clicks) (stove hisses) (water pours) (olivia sighs) - I don't believe she's gone. (sniffs) - here, drink this. It'll warm you up, okay? Is it warm? - Yeah. - Oh, no, that's ice cold. I'm gonna turn the kettle back on. (burner clicks) - what is happening to me? - This is gonna be difficult to hear. Sometimes, when people die, their loved ones go into major depressions, complicated with grief, and in rare cases, denial leads to dissociations, delusions. (kettle hisses) (soft electronic music) you know, about a week ago, you really started to perk up a bit. You seemed to come out of this funk, but then... - then? Then what? - You started talking about hannah a lot, but in the present tense like she was still alive. - She is. - See, that is what worried us. - She's here. - Then you missed your appointment. - I told you about hannah and sydney. Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes, sydney, that is when I realized you may be in a fugue state, characterized by reversible amnesia, motivated by prolonged grief, and then you called to report hannah missing, and I knew you were in trouble. - [olivia] then bruce came over. - Brought you directly to me. (olivia sighs) do you remember all this? (olivia sniffs) do you remember any of this? - I remember everything I told you just like I told you. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. Layne was in a car accident, and hannah went camping with the neighbors. Hannah went camping with the neighbors, right? Right? Hannah went camping with the neighbors. - I'm so sorry, olivia. I should've come over sooner. (olivia sobs) we should've done something as soon as we sensed trouble. (hannah sobs) right now, you just need to rest, okay? Yeah. - No. (door opens) (metal rattles) (dishes rattle) (mary hums) mary. - Oh. - What are you doing here? (mary laughs) - I didn't know you were awake. I thought I'd come over and make you something to eat. - How'd you get in? - Your friend lisa let me in. She stayed over last night. - Oh. - [mary] yeah. - I don't remember going to sleep. - Yeah, you must've been tired. - Well, this is nice of you. - Of course, it's the least I can do. - Is sydney gonna join us? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Don't want her hanging out with the crazy lady. - I'm sorry, olivia. I feel partially responsible for all of this. - You didn't know. I still don't know. I guess I knew at one point, but seeing sydney triggered off this episode, they're calling it, so. But not your fault. - Yeah. Still feel bad. Yeah. Hm. - I just can't believe she's gone. (mary sighs) - I can't even imagine what you're going through. (eerie electronic music) - paintings. - What? - There's two paintings. Where's my phone? - [mary] olivia, what's going... - hannah took a picture. She took a picture at the gallery. She sent it to me. Where is it? (keys rattle) I don't understand. - I know, I know. I'm so sorry. I think it's just gonna take some time. I'm gonna check on sydney, and I'll be right back after and stay here with you. - You've done enough. - No, it's not a problem, really. - Go home. Be with your daughter. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Okay. - Mary. Thank you. - Of course. You have a package. Just let me know if you need anything. - Thank you. (soft electronic music) (car starts) (engine revs) - olivia. What's going on? - They're telling me she's dead. The urns came. One for layne, one for hannah. - Come in. - [man] who told you this? - Bruce and lisa. - Those are layne's friends, right? - More like family. Layne and bruce were like brothers. Layne used to look out for bruce, growing up. - So bruce must've been devastated when he found out that layne was dead. - He was upset, but I don't know about devastated. - Really? That doesn't make a lot of sense. - It doesn't, does it? - Tell me everything that bruce and lisa said. - It started when I didn't believe mary, and I called bruce to report hannah missing. Bruce chambers. - I mean, do you believe it, that hannah's dead? - I don't know. I don't remember anything they're telling me. I'm sorry, I shouldn't be dumping all of this on you. - No, no, hey, stop that. I'm here for you, I wanna be here for you, I'm just sorry the way things turned out for everybody. - It's all layne's fault. He never believed me. You know, he even made up some crazy fantasy about us. - I never wanted to cause any trouble. - Well, there was trouble before you came along. He was cheating on me. - There ever a deliver today? - Yep, I confirmed with the company that left 'em on the porch. Hey, how long do you think it's gonna take for her to accept things? - Don't know, it's hard to say. If she's a fighter, then something like this, (mumbles) - lisa, we owe it to layne to walk her through this. We have to stay strong, for everyone. Okay? - I know. - We're gonna drop these off. I'll come back later. - Layne was cheating? - It's why we moved here. To try to repair our relationship. Thought it'd be helpful if he was near his childhood friends. Even though he was the one who cheated. Do you know he was jealous of our friendship? - Actually I did. I think that might be my fault. - What do you mean? We're friends. We've always been friends. - Olivia, there's something I haven't told you. I started having feelings for you, more than friends, I think layne could tell that. - You never said anything. - You had hannah. You were married. I was trying to hide it. I didn't wanna interfere. - I don't know what to say. - I'm sorry, this is probably not, this is not what you want to be talking about right now. I just thought you were being honest, I thought I'd come clean. - Is it why you left town? (dramatic music plays) - yeah. - (laughs) we weren't happy. - Come on, you guys were the perfect couple. You had hannah, you had a great house, you had a new business, you had a husband who could give you anything that you wanted. - Yeah, it might've looked like that on the outside, but we were a mess. It was a mess. - You guys were growing apart. I mean, it would've gotten better if the accident never happened. - No, he wanted to keep me to himself. He wanted to cheat on me and keep it a secret. The more time you and I spent together, the crazier he got. He didn't want me but he didn't want anyone else to have me either. - [mary] bruce? Can I help you? - Hey. Do you know where olivia is? - She left about an hour ago. - What was her conversation like this morning? - She's processing, but I think she's starting to come around. - Do you think she's gonna be okay? - I think so. I mean, she'll come back when she's ready to face the truth. - When she does, can you give her this envelope? Lisa gathered a bunch of documentation to help her get a handle on everything that's happening. - Uh huh. I'd love to. - [bruce] thanks. - When did all this happen? - The day he died. I told him he had to leave the day he died. - So this guy has everything that anyone could ever want and he was just gonna walk away from that? - Yep. He never broke it off with the other woman. Traveled all the time. I thought it was for work. I believed him. So stupid. - No. Hey, hey. He was your husband, okay? You trusted him. He was a bastard. - Yeah he was. (laughs) he was a bastard. - Who's shawni? - I don't know. I never met her. - So layne was leaving you and then he ended up dead the very same day? - It doesn't make any sense does it? - No it doesn't. - Olivia, what if you're right? What if hannah is still alive? Okay, did anybody see hannah after layne's accident? Anybody else? - She never left her room. I mean, she never went anywhere. Except here. She came here. - Whoa, where are you going? What are you looking for? - Proof. (mysterious music) (mysterious music) (mysterious music) gretchen! -, you scared me. - I'm so sorry. Your office said I could find you here. It's important. - Is everything okay? Did the opening move again? - No it's more serious than that. - What's goin' on? - The other day when you came to the gallery with your invoice, do you remember seeing my daughter? - You daughter? - Hannah. - Look, I'm sorry. I don't really remember. - Please. This is important. Look again. - Yes. - Yes! - Yes, I remember there being a girl there with you. I think that was her. - Okay, can you tell the police? - The police? - She's missing. I need you to tell the police that you saw her that day. - Can I just call them later? I have a bunch of prep I need to do. - No! This is life or death. It has to be in person. Can you please tell them? - Look, I can come with you after I get this stuff on cold storage back at the kitchen. Just give me 45 minutes or so. - Oh my gosh. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bruce, I need you to come to my house as soon as possible. I'll explain when I see you. - (screams) (knock at the door) - oh, thank god. - I came as soon as I could. What's going on? - Someone remembered seeing hannah. - What do you mean? - The caterer from the gallery opening. She was there when hannah was there. She remembers seeing her. - Where is she now? - She'll be here any minute. No. - What is it? - No. - Olivia. What's happening? - I don't understand. She said she remembered seeing hannah. - Olivia, why don't we have a seat? - No, no, no. I don't know why she's not answering. - You know what? I think we need to get back to lisa. - No! (quietly) I'm sorry. You're right. I just need rest. That's all I need. I need rest. - Okay. At least put this on. The last thing we need is for you to get sick, catch a cold. So this lady, the caterer. - It didn't happen. She never saw hannah. I was wrong. - Olivia, you can trust me. - I'm fine. I promise. I'm fine, you can go. You can go. - Hey. We've got a situation here. (knock at the door) - hi, - hi. - Bruce came by, are you okay? - I don't know. I don't know. - Oh, you poor thing. - Thank you for being so supportive. - Of course. Bruce gave this to me. - What is it? - I don't know. He said "just some information that" "should confirm things for you." - do you think you could be with me, while I open this? - Yeah, of course. - I've seen this before. Can you? - Of course. All the info seems to match up. - Okay. - What's that? - An article. - About what. - The accident. It was in the paper. - What's wrong? Okay, olivia please, you need to take it easy. - Look at this. Okay, 2 articles. In this one they both died, in this one he died. - Okay, so the newspaper changed it, okay? - There's too many coincidences. The two paintings, the articles, the caterer. It doesn't make any sense. Bruce made all this up. - Why would he do that? Why? - My daughter is still alive. Jack? Call me back as soon as you can. I have proof that hannah's still alive. - Olivia, if hannah's still alive then who's ashes are those? - I don't know. - Didn't you have to identify the bodies? - Bruce said that layne's body was burned beyond recognition and I believed him. - And hannah's? - No. I mean, I never identified hannah's body because hannah is still alive. - Okay, if hannah's still alive then layne is too? That's the only explanation that makes sense. Oh, your freezing. I'm turning the heat up. - No. I'm fine. - Nothing about this is fine. - I'm fine! (doorbell ring) - are you expecting someone? - No, but I think I know who that is. Follow my lead. Hi. Lisa, bruce, what are you doing here? - Good afternoon olivia. We just came to assess your progress. - [bruce] you doing okay? - You look diaphoretic. - Sweaty. She means sweaty. - I'm hanging in there. You know, taking it hour by hour. - That's good to hear olivia. - Did you get the envelope I left with mary? - I did, and it helped clear up a lot of confusion. - Olivia. - It's fine. Thank you. - Well that is great news olivia, and it's just unfortunate you've had to go through all this, it is. So please, make an appointment with me soon. You need consistent medical support. - Let us know how we can help. We both care about you so much, we just want to make sure you get better. - Thank you both so much. Okay, I'll check in soon. Thanks. - Do you think he believed you? - I don't know. It's hard to tell. - What now? - I'm going to save my daughter. - But you don't know where she is. - There's only one place I haven't been since layne died. - The cabin? - The cabin. - Olivia wait. - I am done waiting. - Okay, well you shouldn't go alone. Let me drive you. - It could be dangerous - we'll be safer together. - Where are you going? Get in. It's okay sweetie. We're gonna go for a little ride. Nothing to be concerned about. - Mom, - come on! Let's go! - I'll be right back. I promise. - What took you so long? - [hannah] couldn't find my jacket. - You ready? - Mm-hm - (squeals) - [hannah] I can't believe you're alive. - I still can't believe it myself. - Just don't understand why we have to hide it. - Well we can't call your mom just yet, banana. - Yeah, but she thinks your dead. It's cruel. - I know. It's just too big of a shock for her right now. All right? - Yeah, but, I mean she's gonna find out eventually and she's gonna be really... - trust me. I know your mom. I'm sorry. - I can't believe I'm just now getting this. It was so obvious. - What was obvious? - Moving to his hometown to save our marriage. He had this planned all along, I mean he knew bruce would do anything for him. - Because layne was like his big brother? - What? - Are they friends or something? - That's not what you said. You just said, "because layne was like his big brother". - Okay. - Why didn't you come home? Why did you just stay up here and just let us think that you were dead? - Cause I didn't know, and after the accident I didn't remember you or your mom at all. I just remember trying to get to the cabin and when I found it, I stayed there. - But you remember me now? - Only after I saw you wandering, looking all alone near the campsites. - It was so weird. It was like all of a sudden, mary and sydney were just gone. - Oh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. (kisses) - wait but, if you're here, then who'd they find in your car? - Hm? - Well bruce said they found a body and if it wasn't you then... - yeah, yeah. Well I picked up a hitchhiker. Guess he didn't survive. - What about your... - listen, I know you have a lot of questions, but the important thing is that we're safe. I'm safe. - Yeah. Yeah. I just I can't believe it's real. I mean, you're alive. You let us think you were dead. - Well how did you know that? - [mary] know what? - That layne was like his big brother? - Because you told me. - No. - You said that bruce didn't have a dad, and his mom was abusive so layne took him under his wing. - I never told you that. - Oh. Maybe it was bruce then. - You've been talking to bruce? - Yes. He knows I've been taking care of you. - (sighs) - hey, so, I mean, I know that you and mom are separating but, things can be different now right? I mean, near death experiences change people. - Honey, I wouldn't get my hopes up. - Yeah, but when she finds out you're alive she's gonna be so happy. And then, she'll forget about the divorce, and then we can be a family. - Hi. - [sydney] I need your help. - Uh, have we met before? - No, but I've heard about you. I'm sydney. I live next door to olivia? I think something really bad's about to happen and I don't know what to do. - Yeah, come on in. - Ooh, so cold. - Why are you turning the heat on? - Because it's cold. - So you do know hannah? - She came camping with us. - So she's alive, which means olivia's right. Why would you lie about this? - My mom told me I had to. - Why are we stopping? - Give me a second. I need to call sydney, to make sure she's okay. - You can't do that in the car? - I'll be back. (suspenseful music) - wait a minute, so your mom, this was all of her idea? - I don't know, she doesn't talk to me most of the time. She's too worried about her love life and taking camping trips so she can sneak to the cabin. - The cabin? Do you mean olivia's cabin? - They're headed there now. I don't know what's going to happen when olivia finds out that my mom lied to her. - Oh my god, we gotta call the police. - We can't, bruce helped cover it up. - Well then we need to make sure that bruce doesn't find out. - [layne] tell me about your new neighbors. What were their names? - Mary and sydney? - Yeah, you like them? - I guess, sydney was cool. (phone ringing) I thought you lost your phone. - I'll be right back, sit tight. Hello? - Hey, she knows. - How, your sis trick didn't work? - She figured it out, layne. - All right, just stop her, tell her we're dead. - It's too late for that. We don't have a choice anymore. - All right, mary, just, make it quick. - I'll take care of it. Olivia, you shouldn't be out here in this cold. (birds chirping) - hey banana. - What's going on? - Listen, um... Something's happened. Your mom, she was in an accident. She was on her way here, and... - No, no, you're lying. - Hannah. - No, no, all of this is a lie, where is she? - Hannah! - Where is she? - Hannah, don't you raise your voice to me! Hey, hey get back here! Get back here! - It is not cold. You, layne, bruce, lisa? You all planned this. - Oh lisa, lisa, that woman is crazy. (device beeping) all of this. (stove clicking) (tea kettle whistling) coffee, tea, the sweaters? It's all part of the mind game that lisa cooked up. There it is, that's the gold mine, right there. That's why we did it. To break you. - What did you do to me? - Gas lighting. (car unlocks) have you heard of it? (sighs) anything that we could tell you, or do to you to change your perception of reality, we did. Lisa called it ambient abuse. We wanted you to end up in a nut house, but he wouldn't take. He should have just listened to me from the beginning. (knife blade sharpening) now I get to make you disappear. After the funeral, me and layne can finally get married. And hannah? Don't worry, I'll take good care of her for you. (dramatic music) (olivia screaming) (breathing heavily) (tree branches rustling) - ah! Hannah? - Mom? - Oh my god! I thought I would never see you again. - Dad said you were dead, but I didn't believe him. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - We gotta get out of here. - Okay, okay. - Stop! (hannah whimpers) - go, hannah, go! (hannah screaming) don't! - Hey, no, mary what are you doing? What are you doing? - What do you mean what am I doing? We talked about this. - This wasn't the plan, no one was supposed to get hurt. - Do you really think they're gonna believe you after all of this? - I don't expect them to, but this has gone too far, it's too messy. - While you were hiding in your cabin, I've been the one holding this together. - No, oh my god, no, no, no, no, please. - This is the end. - No, no, no, mommy. - Put that knife down. - I don't even know why we orchestrated this conspiracy. (hannah crying) we should have killed olivia back in seattle. - What, you think I want this? I can never forgive olivia for what she did. I gave her everything. And now she parades around my town on the arm of some beggin' artist while I get laughed at, then she tries to take my daughter away? Hannah is not part of this. Please, let her go. - Please. (hannah crying) - now. - Please, please, please, no, no. - Move away and you won't get hurt. - Okay, okay, okay. (tires screeching) - sydney called the station, the guys tipped me off. - Alright, everything's under control. - Layne, this isn't the plan. We didn't plan for this variable. - No violence, layne, you promised me. - The situation is untenable. - Olivia, why couldn't you just let us go? Knife! - Put the knife on the ground! - Alright bruce! Let me handle this. Hey! - I can't let this go down. It's a mess, you've gone too far. - Bruce, you owe me, you'd be dead in the gutter if I hadn't brought you in, alright? Hey hey! Take hannah back to the cabin, now. - No, she's mine! - Put the knife on the ground. - Get away from me! - Put it on the ground! - Take her to the cabin. - No, come a little closer, (laughing) I'll make it quick. You ready to die? - No no! (olivia screaming) (gun firing) - dad! Oh my god, daddy? No, no, no, no. (hannah crying) - we're safe. - Mommy. - It's okay, we're okay, I promise, I promise. I promise. I promise. (sad music) how are you feeling? - I don't know, I mean, I hate dad for what he did, but I still kind of miss him. - I understand, and it's okay. - Thanks, mom. - Have you heard from sydney? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, she made it to seattle, and I mean she's still pretty broken up about everything, but I think her grandparents are really happy to have her there. (camera shutter clicks) - progress check. - Yeah, it's comin' along. - It is. - Hey, come here. (camera shutter clicking) - come here. - You okay? - I'm just making sure you're real. - I'm real. You want some lemonade? - Yes. - [olivia] so, he liked this last one. - [jack] this reminds me of the north carolina clam bay. Yeah, I would've not probably done it this way, but, to each his own. - I don't know it's... - Maybe it's in your eyes only and so. - It's sweet. I think it's sweet. - How's hannah doing? - She's good. We're resting a lot easier now that lisa and bruce have been sentenced. - [jack] hmm. - It's been hard, but you know we're getting through it, day by day. - Yeah, that's all we can do. - Yeah. How are you feeling, now that the exhibit's over? - (sighs) I'm feeling pretty, pretty good. - You had excellent reviews, great sales. - I can't really complain, you know it went better than I expected, so. - But? - But there is one more thing. - What? - Hold that thought. (soft music) - what? You didn't sell it. - I didn't, no, how could I? You know I painted this for you the first time I couldn't tell you what it truly meant, but now I can. - What do you mean? - Just, I know you've been through a lot, and maybe you're not really great right now, but I just wanna let you know that I'm here for you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Yeah. - After everything we've been through, I don't know where I'd be without you. You're my rock. Hannah's too. Thank you. (both chuckling) ♪
