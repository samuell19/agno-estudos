[Woman sings prayer song] [Speaking in spanish] [Translator]: Welcome to this place. [First woman continues speaking in spanish] [Translator]: What'’s your name? [Man]: Jack. [Woman hums a tune] Oh... -Malo! -[Translator]: Bad. [Woman continues humming] Carta de la traicion. The card of the betrayal. [Fortune teller speaks in spanish] The card of death. [Fortune teller hums] -[Speaking in spanish] -Raise your hand. [Speaking in spanish] Ooh. [Speaking in spanish] There is bad things in your way. [Speaking in spanish] Very evil in your way. [Fortune teller sings prayer song] [Water bottle sloshes] [Continues singing] [♪] [Hums] [Humming echoes] [Gasping] [Coughing] [Water splashes] [Gasping] You know, i'’d like to say that this isn'’t personal, but it really kind of is. You know as well as I do there'’s always someone trying to kill our boss. [Slaps loudly] [Groans] [Pants] Hazards of being an international businessman, I guess. But it is exclusively for this reason that those of us in charge of his security keep his scheduled whereabouts a secret. Now, that makes sense, right? [Pants in exhaustion] Right, right. So when we discovered that you had tipped off someone that our boss was visiting his operations in havana, naturally, we were disappointed that you a loyal member until now, would betray the organization for money, or a prius... [Yelling] Or whatever! Which you did, right? Yeah. Whew. Talk about a disgruntled employee. Did we screw you out of a christmas bonus or something? [Thug]: Miami job. Said he no got paid. Oh, shit. Did we not pay you for that? Oh, well, no wonder. A man has gotta feed his family. Speaking of which, I have always wanted to play your favorite game, that game that you always played in interrogations... No, no. Let'’s play for the lives of your family. Your son, um... Jeremy. Jeremy. Done. Let'’s play for jeremy. Okay, benny. Who are we talking about? Who are we talking about? The broker. That fucking bitch. But okay, jeremy lives, hmm? [Slaps arm in encouragement] Well played. Now, do you love your wife? Because you know very well she'’s no good as a bargaining chip if you'’re banging her sister or something. [Sobbing] I love her, I love her. Good, well then, we'’ll play for your wife. When are we talking about? Some time over the next three days. He shoots, he scores. Isn'’t that what you always said? Okay, the wife lives, too. Now, is there anything else that we need to know? [Gasping, sobbing breaths] Can... What'’s that, benny? My wi-- hmm? What'’s that, benny? Can my wife have the miami job money? Please? Please? I'’ll have to ask mr. Libby. Sure. Why not? You'’ve earned it. Thank you. [Whimpers in fear] [Gunshot] [Dramatic music] [♪] Attention all passengers. Flight 017 to havana is delayed. Scheduled departure is now 1:00 a.m. out of gate six. [People groan] Whoo! Yes... Mm... [Sighs in satisfaction] I guess I just made a lot of enemies, huh? Excuse me? Our delay to havana? Probably not the best idea to whoop. Oh, right, uh... I'’m happy about it, too. I'’m just not a big whooper. Yeah, I sense that about you. So what'’s your problem with paradise? Uh, nothing, really. It'’s just I'm going on a convention, and I don'’t think i'll get enough time to enjoy it. I say skip it. What, the conference? Yeah. What'’s it for? Insurance. [Laughs] Definitely skip it. And you know what the first thing you should do? You should go to the bar and get a drink, and then go find the square. You'’ve gotta go find the fortune teller. They'’re gonna tell you that you'’re gonna meet a mysterious woman. Uh, I just did. Yeah, no, i'’m not-- i'’m not a mysterious woman. It sounds tempting, but... Mm, but you'’re stuck. -Yeah. -Yeah. I'’m practically being human trafficked. Not really, I mean. I agreed to be, so... That didn'’t come out right. Hey, no, it'’s none of my business. No, it'’s definitely not. That'’s why telling you might be so much fun. For you, maybe. You never know. What if I whisper it to you? Then it'’ll be like you never heard a thing. [Indistinct whispering] -Impressive, huh? -I'’ll say. [Scoffs] The thing is, how was I supposed to know i'’d end up the mistress of someone like that? -Not ideal. -Mm, i'’ll say. You'’d think his ambiguous wealth would'’ve been a tip-off. -Does he have a mustache? -No. There you go. Hard to tell, then. You have a moustache. [Chuckles] Oh, I have to figure out a way to get out of this. Hey, you wanna kill a gangster for me? Uh...sure. You'’re right. I shouldn'’t have told you all that. I should just shut the hell up. I'’m sorry. It was nice talking to you. How about on this trip, we both try to have some fun? [Scribbles something down with a pen] After all... We'’re gonna be in paradise, right? [Clapping] [Cuban music] Sir? Excuse me, sir? Hi. We'’re here. [Cuban music] [♪] [Customs agent]: Look into the camera, please. [♪] [Stamps] Proximo! Pardon.

[Speaking in spanish] [Cuban music] [♪] You a baseball fan? Um, I-I like all sports. Me too. They say, uh, castro tried out for the yankees. [Laughs] Well, hell of a curve ball, but i'’m afraid that'’s an urban myth. Never happened. "Maggie is pretty to look at. "Maggie is a loving lass. "But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle. "The truest of loves must pass. "A million surplus maggies "are willing to bear the yoke. A woman is only a woman." "But a good cigar is a smoke." Enjoy. Jack petty. Harry. [Speaking in spanish] Club havana rum here is fucking delicious. -And that, my friend-- -smells like a robusto. [Lighter snaps] Man knows his kipling and his smokes. Bad habit for a while. Eh, there'’s nothing bad about it. Life is meant to be enjoyed. When death comes my way, I want coke in my nose, pussy on my dick, and a cohiba in my mouth. Salud! What do you do? Travel writer. -Yeah? -Yeah. Here for esquire,you know, doing a piece on the scene. Can I do you a favor, jack? Sure. You walk around town with a map, you'’ll be dealing with scammers and bullshit all day, maybe worse. You don'’t need a map. I know this city. Let'’s go see havana. Eh? [Cuban music] [♪] [♪] So you know, meyer lansky built this place. Yeah, he was going to take over the whole caribbean, and he barely finished the hotel and casino before they shat on him. What happened? Our friend fidel happened. Yeah, lansky fucked off quick while they were looting the casino and "liberating" the hotel. C'’est la vie, yeah? So that woman at the bar, she called you padre? Yeah, well, you know, my first time in havana five years ago, on a job, and hooked up with these two cuban chicks, you know, young, twenties, both beautiful. You know, and we hung around three or four days, and I took care of them, buying them shit, and they started calling me "papa." Well, fucking hemingway was called papa, and I didn'’t want to seem like some sort of old pervert, so I said, "make it padre." You know, "father." So when i'’m down here, that's what some of them call me. [Cell phone vibrates] Sorry, I gotta take this. [Beeps as call is accepted] Yeah, hello? [Speaks in french] You like bikes? [Dramatic music] [♪] [Car honks horn] [♪] [Harry]: Well, here we are. It'’s, uh, probably best if you just keep your mouth shut, eh? Let'’s park over here. -Ariel! Hermano! -Fucking hell. Aw, c'’mon, gimme some love, big man! Yeah! Fucking pepe! You french bastard! You'’re still alive! That'’s impressive! Harry fucking smith. Pinch me. I must be dreaming, huh? And this is my, uh, bon ami,jack. Bonjour,jack. [Speaking in french] But sadly, you must stay there, so... No, no, no, i'’ve got a bill to pay, remember? Oui,i remember, and the cashier in the back, jack. Allons,harry fucking smith. Allons,fucking pepe! This is, uh, my bon ami. Yes, she certainly is, isn'’t she? Hello! Nice to meet you, darling. [Door closes] [Door closes] Let'’s go, jackolo. [Cuban jazz] [♪] [Kids laughing and yelling] He shoots! He scores! [Laughs] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! [♪] Ahh! [♪] No mas!

I'’m feeling pretty buzzed. [Laughs] No, man, that'’s just the warm up. What are you talking about? For the night that is to come. You know, in a few hours time, you'’re gonna have some of the hottest girls in cuba trying to start a fire in your crotch with their ass. Salsa, mi amigo,eh? Harry, come on. I'’m not much of a dancer. Can you stand still and smile? -Yeah, I can do that. -Then you'’ll be fine. Just keep '’em in front of you, you know, they'’ll do the rest. You got a tie? Uh, no, I didn'’t bring one. Well, you can borrow one of mine. -Estas bien? -Muy bien. Muy bien. Well, fucking muy bien. Look at that, eh? Here you go. Something to remind you of me, eh? Gracias. [Speaking in spanish] [Loud thud] -[Yelling in spanish] -You fucking blind, man? -[Yelling in spanish] -Have you got a problem? -Have you? Huh? Huh? -[Yells angrily in spanish] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Jack, easy. Come on, let'’s go. Get your bike. Let'’s go. It's fine. [Makes mocking kissing noises] Come on, then. Hey, hey, it'’s fine. Come on. [Yelling in spanish] [Coldcut'’s "man in a garage" playing] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] ♪ Slide over [♪] ♪ Slide over [knocking, door opens] -Harry? -Back here! Hey. Got my grey shirt on, but I got my blue one back in the room if that goes better with your, uh, tie. Hey, hermano. You'’re looking good. [Sniffs] You want some? No, i'’m good. [Sniffs] Here. Here you go. Uh... Look, i'’m gonna be rather busy tomorrow, and i'’m going soon, so I may not see you. Got you a souvenir. Something to put your rum in back in canada. We'’ll, uh, we'll get a bottle on the way out, use it tonight. Booze is fucking expensive in the clubs for us turistas. "Let'’s get ready to rumba!" So this guy, right, steaming drunk, he'’s so drunk, he'’s thrown up down the front of his jacket, right? He goes, "no, no, my wife'’s gonna fucking divorce me for sure this time." And his pal says, "no, no, "you go home with 20 quid in your hand, right? "You tell her someone threw up on you, and that'’s to pay for the dry cleaning, right?" So the guy goes home, his wife goes fucking mental with him. He says, "no, no, no." He gives her the fucking story. And she says, "yeah, but why have you got two 20-pound notes in your hand?" He says, "oh, the other one is from the guy who shat in my pants." [Laughs] Eh? Oh, man, that'’s beautiful. Hey, um, what'’s the word for "bathroom"? Bano. Hey, senor, bano? Bano? No, no, no. [Speaking in spanish] [Speaking in spanish] Grande. [Urinating] [Yelling in spanish] [Both yelling spanish] I don'’t speak span-- [yelling in spanish] I don'’t understand what you're saying! I'’m sorry. [Both yelling in spanish] [Yelling in spanish] [Whimpering] [Stammers in spanish] Shh, shh, shh. [Speaking in spanish] [Speaking in spanish] [All speaking in spanish] Shh, shh, shh, shh. [Speaking in spanish] -[Stammering in spanish] -Shh. [Speaking in spanish] If you fuckers do not count to 500... -[Whimpers] -Shh. I will fucking give you a punulada. -I'’ll kill you. -[Sobbing] -Claro? -[Sobbing] [Speaking in spanish] [Counting in spanish] [Both counting in spanish] Harry, jesus christ. What the hell was going on? What did he think I was doing? You were pissing on his mom'’s doorstep. Did you cut that guy? -So? -So? So fucking relax, man. Come on. Life'’s meant to be enjoyed, eh? And next time, try pissing inside, eh? Harry, how many travel writers carry weapons? I'’ve pissed in some bad places, jack. [Both counting in spanish] So, uh, so this place is nice, right, but the girls aren'’t. So just...Oh, man! Just smile, all right, and when it comes time to seal the deal, leave it to me, and i'’ll get us all squared up, all right? Jack. Fuckin'’ smile, man! There you go. C'’mon. [Cuban club music] [♪] [♪] [♪] [Inhales cocaine] [Big ben chimes] [Woman]: Success in any venture depends on one'’s ability to adhere to the rules of commerce. You can supply arms to terrorists, traffic in drugs, sell teenage girls... Kidnap, murder, blackmail, it hardly matters. [Rings doorbell] Like any other business, strict adherence to the rules ensures your ability to protect your interests and ensure profitability. And the rule most crucial to the survival of your business is, "always pay your bills." Very educational, ma'’am. Definitely buying the book on tape. Now do you mind telling me your views on coming to the fucking point? [Laughs with a little snort] That'’s the thing I most enjoyed about you, harry, your incandescent charm. Well, you should see my dick. Fucking thing'’s a belter. Oh, don'’t threaten me, harry. I may take you up on it. After all, you'’re only here because you have a lot of making up to do, isn'’t that right? [Birds chirp in the background] Hey, you called, I came. And i'’m not in the bow-and-scrape business. You think I owe you? I think I did my job. You wanted a minister removed. A minister was removed. And his wife? The sister of the deputy prime minister? [Scoffs] Well, what can I say? I'’d have preferred her to remain... Present. Her removal has cost me greatly. All right, then, so I was... A wee bit sloppy. More than a wee bit, I think. Then...i am sorry, for fuck'’s sakes. See, harry? Not so difficult. In fact, it'’s the formal declaration that a mistake has been made that paves our way forward. So, good for you. Who'’s the lucky winner? When you arrive in cuba, you'’ll be contacted by our facilitator named palmer. Suffice it to say, your objective is someone with whom i'’ve done a great deal of business over many years, but who, for some unfortunate reason, now mistakenly believes that the rules of commerce no longer apply to him. He has decided to take advantage of our relationship. Of course, worst of all... He didn'’t pay his bills. Got it. Voila. Now, harry, do try and get back into my good graces by resisting your propensity to completely fuck this up. [Pulsing cuban club music] [♪] -How about some grace? -Yes. What'’s your name, darling? Day. Day? What, as in... Like, isn'’t it a beautiful day? It certainly fucking is now. And what'’s the name of your pal dancing with my buddy over there? That'’s night. What, night? As in... Like, my friend and I are going to... Oh, baby! Shall we? Oi, jacko! C'’mon, we're off. Nice to meet you, darling. Come on, man, let'’s go. [Jazz music playing] [♪] [Sighs] Catarina... Legs... The way she was standing, you know, it just stopped me in my tracks. Rather like you'’re doing, baby. And all I can think of is, "I fucking promised her i'’d see her. I think I love her." Sorry. -So what happened next? -So i'’m looking around, right, and I see this bottle by the side of the road. [Laughs] I take off my shirt, put the necklace in the bottle, put the note in the bottle, rip my shirt, shove it into the bottle to cap it. And the river is fucking rolling round like it'’s pissed, but I don'’t care. -And I jump in. -Yes! Bottle over my head, you know, protecting the goods, and i'’m swimming with one arm. And the current'’s fucking knocking me around like i'’m a fucking pinball, but i'’m young, and i'’m determined, and... [Inhales cocaine] And i'’m losing. But i'’m fighting it. And finally, I summon up all the energy left, and I yell, -"someone fucking get this!" -Come on! And I throw the bottle at the people as hard as I can, and... And I go under, and I hit my head on a rock, and I float down the stream. What happened? I woke up in hospital with a cute nurse stitching me up. Did she ever get the necklace? I don'’t know. But I screwed the nurse that night. [Laughing] Come on. Let'’s go have some fun. We have to write our own stories. [Door opens, closes] You'’re handsome. Nice smile. Do you have someone? Not anymore. Maybe i'’ll come see you in canada. Is it cold there? Yeah. It'’s cold. But you'’ll keep me warm, right? Tell me what you want... Anything. [Inhales deeply] [Pants for air] [Gasping] [Labored breathing] Yeah. [Suspenseful music] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] Harry, i'’m, uh, i'’m heading out. I don'’t-- what the-- what the hell are you doing? [Laughs] Oh, shit. Damn it. Fuck. Oh, no. Don'’t do this to me. Harry? Harry! Harry? Harry. Oh, no. Shit. [Phone ringing] Yeah? [Dial tone] [Knocking] Housekeeping. Uh, no, uh, no necesario. Manana, por favor. Gracias. [Housekeeping cart rolls away] I'’ve been calling the room. Excuse me? They forget your wake-up call? Uh, yeah. Well, punctuality is the least of all virtues, mr. Smith. However, an hour is pushing it. Sorry. -Are you alone? -Yes. -Everything all right? -Yeah. I thought you'’d be taller. [Laughing] It'’s a nice day... Out there. The sun is shining. Guavas are flowing. Do you mind if I, uh, use your toilet? Uh, no, no, no. No. I'’m sorry, uh... My stomach, uh, the water... I don'’t know. It'’s rough. You don't want to go in there. [Deliberately loud] Oh, i'’m sorry to hear that. Well, thankfully, I have excellent bladder control. Uh... Why don'’t we take this outside, huh, partner? Good idea. I don'’t know if you've tried the cafe bombon here, but... It'’s excellent. [Elevator dinging] [Stomach gurgles noisily] [Peacock screeches] Buenos dias. Cafe bombon. Cafe bombon? Dos cafe bombon. Gracias, amigo. Okay. [Pills rattle] They'’re good, trust me. So tonight... [Stomach gurgles] The, uh, the wire transfer was to your satisfaction? Correct? Correct. Good. You seem a little out of it. Are you okay? -Yes. -Sober up. This is, of course, of the utmost importance. Gracias, amigo. [Stomach gurgles] Oh... [Speaking in spanish] Sorry to be such a hard-ass. It'’s just that... Well, I am aware of your previous... Idiosyncrasies. It'’s okay. We'’re prepared for that. In fact, that'’s why you were chosen. That comes as a surprise? Of course not. You, of course, are harry smith. Now... [Clears throat] It'’s fucking ulcers. As per your request. May I? You don'’t have to be cute with me. The rest of the money will be wired to you once the body is found. Do you understand your instructions? Yes. [Pills rattle] Good. Then you will kindly settle up this bill. Shouldn'’t be a problem, right? Okay. Hola! [Ominous music] [♪] Signor! La cuenta. Your bill. Oh, okay. Thanks. You'’re welcome. Ah, senor, habla ingles? Uh...yeah. Awesome. Can you please take a picture of us? We wanna...We wanna save this moment. -Come on, please, man. -Please. -Um... -Come on. Yeah? Oh, great! Great! Thank you. -Oh, glasses! -Glasses. -Take the picture. -[Chuckles] Sorry. [Camera clicks] You must be canadian. You said "sorry." -Yeah. -Yeah? -No shit! -I just married this man. I'’m his missus now. That'’s great. I'’m gordie. This is grace. -Jack. -Nice to meet you, jack. Hey, why don'’t you join us for a drink? -Yeah! -Oh, no, no, no. Hey, you can'’t say no. It'’s bad luck to turn down a toast to a bride. That'’s right. You do not want bad luck, jack. Come on, sit down. Have a drink with us. You'’re in cuba. There you go. Oh, what am I doing? Can'’t sit for a toast! [Laughs] To the woman who picked me up when I was down... Oh... And breathed happiness and life back into me. -We may stumble. -We may. I want to grow old with this man, share our history together. Completely paraphrased from our vows. -Very honest. -Not very original. [Inaudible talking] Guys, I, uh... I gotta go. Oh, sorry, man, I know it'’s a lot. [Cuban music] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] [Jack]: So after everything that happened, I didn'’t know where to turn, so I, uh, I came to the embassy because I knew that i'’d be safe. You made the right choice. Hmm. Normally, when a citizen shows up at the embassy with a gun in a cigar box and tells us he found a dead guy in a hotel bathtub and then insists that a complete stranger has asked him to kill some-- this guy, he'’s usually a paranoid tourist who'’s just seen too many movies... Or a criminal trying to avoid the local authorities. I know this sounds completely crazy. [Chuckles] You have no idea. [Laughs] To tell you the truth, if we didn'’t already believe you, you'’d be in our underground holding cell instead of here in my office talking to me. So you do believe me? The man in your photograph, his name is francis libby. One of the largest supplier of arms to drug cartels in the caribbean, and some say all of north america. Personally, I think that'’s an overstatement, but... The idea of an insurance executive from vancouver being contracted to kill an international crime boss is... [Laughing] As you said... It'’s completely crazy. It'’s completely crazy. Thank you. [Laughing] I mean, this whole thing has been... Overwhelming. Yes! Yeah, i'’ll bet. [Laughter] [Laughing] I bet. [Laughter] [Trails off slowly, still chuckling] Oh... How about this? We take you back to your hotel... You make a statement to the havana police, and we get you on a plane out of cuba this afternoon. How does that sound? Sounds great. After you. Let us get to it. I have a question about insurance. -You bet. -I feel awkward saying this... [Door slams] You know, it'’s lucky you made it to the embassy first. It'’s hell of a lot harder to get you out of a cuban prison. Frankly, I don'’t know how in the world I would have been able to convince a group of scary people I had nothing to do with this. Neither do I. The thing is... We'’d like you to give it the old college try. [Taser zaps and crackles] [Engine starts up] [Car peels away] [Panting and gasping] Where am I? We like to call this an undisclosed location. I don'’t understand. First, a few questions. How long have you been working with harry smith? What? I haven'’t! I don'’t--i don't even-- I just-- just barely met the man! Ah. Uh-huh. What was your plan for killing francis libby? I'’m not! But what you are doing is fucking illegal. Oh, that'’s true. As a canadian official, I cannot violate the rights and freedoms of a canadian citizen. However, i'’m not really here in any kind of an official capacity and neither are you. I'’m here representing the personal interests of an important benefactor, and you'’re here, excuse me, to tell me what it is that you know. I don'’t know anything. Yeah, well, that'’s the thing. There'’s really only one way to determine that, and hence you being strapped to this cot. For my money, torture is a flawed method of extracting information, but it'’s the only one we'’ve got. Now, perhaps it'’s a failure of imagination, certainly of technology, because a lie detector can tell us that you'’re telling a lie, but it can'’t compel you to tell the truth. You see what I mean? Anyway, we'’re gonna torture you, jack, and then we'’ll see what'’s what. No, no. Wait, please. Wait! Please! No, please! [Screaming] [Tense music] Tell me how you fit in! [Water splashes] How do you fit into this equation? -That'’s all we want to know. -Ahh! [♪] Help! Jack, tell us the truth. How do you fit in to this equation? Please. Tell me the answer! [♪] How are you connected to harry? Jack, you can'’t breathe. [Splashing water] [Gurgling] Well, that didn'’t work. Wrap him up, boys. We'’ve been working on him for the last 16 hours. He'’s ready to say anything. He'’s not a good swimmer. I think... We'’ve got all the information we'’re gonna get out of him. So aside from the usual entities who want you dead, I think we'’ve got this situation well contained... From a loose ends perspective, et cetera. Of course. The boys are taking care of it as we speak.

You'’re gonna need this. [Cuban music] [Whispering] What the fuck? [Knocking] Well, look who'’s here. So how'’s paradise been treating you...? Jack. Jack. Actually... It'’s been rough. You okay? Yeah, no. I'’m good. Good, because i'’m the one who should be self-conscious. I don'’t drop my info off on every handsome stranger I meet at an airport bar. -You think i'’m handsome? -[Chuckles] Now, there'’s the man I don'’t know or love. So what'’re we drinking? Actually, uh, I can only stay a few minutes. Come on, I usually like it to last longer than that. It'’s just that, well, um, you seem like you have other plans. Well, you'’re wrong about that, jack. I don'’t have other plans. I have plans. How do you feel about being the "other" part? Drink? Sure. [Glasses clink] About all that stuff I said the other night? I was drunk and in one of my weird, "confess everything" moods, but everything'’s fine. Really? '’cause I'm gonna go ahead and not believe a word of that. Okay, mostly fine. See, i'’m not gonna believe that either. And there'’s something i'’m gonna have to tell you. It'’s serious. Really? Is it a fun-killer? It sounds like a fun-killer. It could be. All right. All right, then, before you ruin the mood, i'’m gonna go slip out of this dress, and then we'’ll see how you feel about being so serious. Was that too slutty? Actually, that was just the right amount of slutty. [Knocking] Hola. No, no, jack! Jack! [Grunts] [Dramatic music] Jack. Petty. Francis libby. I'’d like to say it's a pleasure to meet you, but it'’s not. Now you say something. I'’m all set here, thanks. You'’re all set? Oh, you'’re cool? Because from where i'’m standing, you'’re totally fucked. Here you are, neck-deep in shit, and you shrug it off like you got a fucking set of titanium balls. And this is after we'’ve tortured him once already. What is this, some "loser'’s last stand?" You'’re about to get shot in the face, chopped into little pieces, because your majesty, the queen of fucking everything, who put a contract on me for a debt she thinks I owe, which I don'’t. Try telling her, try fucking telling her that. I tried. Anyway, you are either the unluckiest fuck in the history of the planet, or... You set this whole plan up right from the beginning just so you could meet me face-to-face. Which one is it? I sell insurance. That'’s what I thought. Oh, don'’t worry. I haven'’t forgotten about you. When i'’m finished dealing with him, i'’ve got something special for you. Okay, well, I think that'’s it. Mm. Gentlemen? [Gun cocks] No, wait. Please, let her go. And we'’re square. What'’s that, an offer? It is. Thanks. But I decline. Here'’s my counter offer. You'’re just dead. I tried. Close, but no cigarro. [Grunting] [Gunfire] You'’ll never get out of this fucking city alive. You were right. I needed to see you face-to-face to deliver a message in person. The broker sends her regards. [Ticking clock] Get me jack petty. That fucking bitch. If I were you, i'’d feel the same way. [Gunshot] [Panting] [Gunshot] [Groans] [Gurgling] [Whimpers] You wanted out? Now you'’re out. You listen to every word I say, you'’re gonna be all right. You understand? Good. I'’m gonna leave. Then you leave. You head straight for the airport. You buy a ticket for the first international destination. You stay for a day, and you head home from there. You understand? Good. You forget about libby. You forget about cuba. You forget about me. Got it? How did you do this? '’ll tell you what. I'’ll whisper it in your ear. It'’ll be like you never heard a thing.
