1 809 the Kingdom of Sweden loses Finland to the Russian Empire. By the 1 850s the Finnish intelligentsia has divided into two. The Fennomen dream of Finland's independence. Their opponents would like to see Finland belong to Sweden again. Finland is governed by Swedish which the majority of the people don't speak. To lessen the power of those wanting to belong to Sweden - Russian emperor Alexander ll commands - that the Finnish language be used as the official language within 20 years. ln 1 846 a Finnish-speaking tailor's son Alexis Stenvall is sent to school. He goes to school in Helsinki to become a priest. ln December 1 857 Alexis Stenvall, then 23, matriculates. THE LIFE OF ALEKSIS KIVI l see. l see. Fox-hunting for upper-class whores. The fur will pay our admission into cultural events. Forget that. You don't need the upper-class. You must write and become famous and then you can dream about women. Besides, l am done skiing for today. Who said anything about skiing? And how can you ski when your ski is broken? We only have to climb that hill and scare the fox out of its lair. The little beast is hiding there assuming it's safe - not knowing he is about to meet Emil Nervander, a noble playwright. Don't mock me. l can't help not being such a wild beast like you. Alexis! That's where it has gone in. Do we fire into the lair? - We don't need to. We need subtler methods here. Take this. You go and stab it straight into its heart. Go on. Where are you going? l'm going up that hill to see better if it comes out. l Act Young Alexis Stenvall There it is. Try to behave now. Don't speak Finnish here. lt's better you don't say anything at all. lf anyone asks about the smell of shit in this fur - don't reveal l got scared. Don't worry. l'll be loyal to you bourgeois. As sure as l have baron von Adlercreutz's blood in my veins. Alexis Stenvall, you are tailor Stenvall's son. Good evening. l am Alexis Stenvall. Born von Adlercreutz. l am the baron's son out of wedlock and this is my friend Emil Nervander. We are young students. Our principal suggested - that we acquaint ourselves with your Fennomen movement. But you don't even have the golden pin in your student's cap. l couldn't afford to buy it. But l brought this fur to keep you warm on dark and chilly nights. And now to the highlight of the night. An ode to Finnish culture - written by Johan Runeberg who honours us with his presence tonight. Dear friends, please follow me to the small saloon. Up on the wilds of Saarijärvi farmed Paavo his frost-tender farm Looked after his land And worked hard Looked after his land And worked hard And counted on Lord's blessing for growth. What the hell is this? This a disgrace. Why don't they recite from the Kalevala? Look, they haven't even bothered to invite Lönnrot here. As an author of the Kalevala, he should definitely be here. God has abandoned us lsn't this the poem in which that Runeberg cleverly desribes us Finns - as feeble-minded blockheads? Who year after year walk hunch-backed without complaining - while this gentry here, mouth full of cookies and wine on their lips - is creating Finnish Swedish culture. Shut up. Summer came with a hail storm Not one ear was beaten down Autumn came and the frost yielded That is master tailor Palmqvist's daughter Albina. Paavo's wife pulled her hair and said Paavo's wife pulled her hair and said Paavo, Paavo You unfortunate man Paavo got down on his knees and said God is trying us but he will not abandon us Watch me. l'll show you how a real gentleman should behave. He says he is Johan Runeberg and that he represents the nation's future. Thank you. Mister Runeberg is right, as always. l would like to suggest a song composed by Fredrik Pacius - our German friend, whose mannerism we all know well. Runeberg has written the lyrics which are so simple that - even the simple Finns can learn them despite limited command of Swedish. The song is Our Land. Our land Finland, our fatherland Let the sweet words echo high There is no valley nor hill No shore nor lake More dear than in our northern land This precious fatherland Ladies and gentlemen. l am Alexis Stenvall. lf all of you have spoken already l would like to give an example - as a proof of our nation's repertoire. What is that land of hill and dale That is so beautiful, The land aglow with summer days, Land with the northern lights ablaze, Whose beauty all the seasons share, What is that land so fair? There many thousand lakes are bright With twinkling stars at night, There many kanteles resound And all around make hillsides sing And on the golden heath firs ring: That is the Finnish land. Listen young man, whoever you are. How can you speak Finnish here? Who are you and what are you doing here? Mister Snellman wants to know how you can recite in Finnish? lt is impossible. ln Finland there is only poetry written in Swedish. Hello brothers. lt's me, Alexis. Can't you see? You haven't visited your home for a long time, dipshit. lt's good you came home. Mother has been asking about you. l want to see Mother, too. Listen brothers, l have managed to get into civil society. Next weekend l'm going to a fête hosted by Mrs. Rosencrantz. l'm going with Emil, my best friend l have told you about. And there is Albina, a woman. Good evening, Mother and Father. l have been studying hard like you wished - so l could enter the seminary for priests. l got a message from the minister that- l have to buy a clergyman's robe in order to get in. lt costs ten roubles. l have got one foot in the door, figuratively speaking. l was asked to join the church choir. Dear God Save this grievous life But the situation is such - that if l don't get the money now l will never become a priest. lf Mother could give me the ten roubles or at least three - l would soon be a priest - in the same church great grandfather helped build. Mother and Father would be there to listen. Fellow Fennomen. We must now rise and assume the reins - on the lines laid down by German philosopher Friedrich Hegel. Here we are. ln a civilised Shrovetide carnival. Let's keep our faces straight and our mouths shut. We will not speak Finnish. lf l don't understand something you'll translate, is that clear? Are these costumes really sensible? Why couldn't we dress up normally? Normally? Who wants to see normal? lf you want to be part of civil society you'll do as we agreed. You'll go up there to enter a student flying contest. l'll play a bugaboo. We must somehow unite this people - and gather all the powers to achieve our ultimate goal. That's why we must create and promote Finnish literature - even though we won't be able to read it ourselves. They are coming. - Who? Never mind. Go now and fly. Hello, my dear mamsells. How are you? I hope it's all good. I'm a horrifying bogeyman from the woods. You can't fool us. You are the hunter who writes poems in Finnish. Kullervo of Kalevala is my name. Unfortunately l cannot reveal my identity. But l can tell you l'm a frightening bugaboo. Here is Albina Palmqvist, my relative. Hello. - Hello. Could you speak Swedish a little slower, less artistically? Oh my God! That was Emil. Mister Stenvall. - Miss Palmqvist. Emil had to be patched up a little. lt's nothing serious. l think there was a little tornado when he had to fly - and he started to spin downwards. Why do you want to break the divine order that prevails in this country? l knew you could speak Finnish. You just pretended you didn't. You succeeded in creating powerful enemies by speaking Finnish. But Snellman and Runeberg emphasise the glory of Finnish. Finnish is interesting but it's a dying language of the commonality. You cannot even study in Finnish. That's true since Snellman, Topelius and Runeberg don't know a word of it. They are Finnish geniuses who are known even in Sweden and Germany. They are the soul of the nation and the light of this country. Finland wouldn't exist if it wasn't for them. Calm down. l don't want to be petty - and not understand their greatness. But l doubt their motives. l don't think people like Paavo in Runeberg's poem exist. Of course l see that he wants to depict the Hegelian ideal. Who are we to criticise him? lf he says so, it is so. Miss Palmqvist, come visit my home in Palojoki. l'll show you what real Finnish country life is like. l'll show you what a real hillbilly is like. lt would be an honour and a pleasure. Alpertti, how could you put that on? Can't you even dress like a grown man? What the hell is that smell? Did you shit your pants? Go change your pants. Don't go near them. Say hello and leave. ls that clear? Try to behave yourself. Here is my mother baroness von Adlercreutz. Ladies Albina Palmqvist and Amalia Rosencrantz. And Emil Nervander. Mother was a little nervous. Actually she is not a relation at all, just my wet nurse. Sorry for this mess, l have just finished writing. Those Finnish poems? - Yes. Plays, too. To make you believe it's not only Runeberg who can write. But you cannot write poetry in Finnish. lt's impossible. People have written Finnish poetry and rhymes for centuries. Kalevala and our nation's oral tradition are proofs that you can. That's only simple scribble. Real poetry is another thing. You cannot write poems like that in Finnish. Oh Amalia It's so sad When they treat Runeberg so bad Don't involve Runeberg in this. You don't have the skills to write poetry. l have already written some. Now l have a whole love poem here, written in Swedish. A Swedish poem? I love thee I love thee Please, my lovely dear Barbarella My Albina Come and dance with me? I will kill for thee Please, dear Barbarella Here we are. We are here to see the girls. Bloody oafs! This is where our mansion was before the Russians burnt it down. Suddenly my mind is flooded with memories of our forefathers - and their fathers fighting with nice Swedish soldiers against Russians. Oh Gustavus Vasa and Sven Dufva and the others. Wasn't your father a tailor? - Don't start again. What are you doing? We were supposed to encourage our literary endeavours - but you start hitting on an upper-class maiden. Don't ruin this now. Here the girls and boys of the village swing and fall in love. This is the swing hill, the prettiest place in the village. You have your own world that we know nothing of. You really don't. That's true. l am writing a comedy of all that. l'm going to depict the characters of the country in a Runebergian manner. l have discovered a part of Runeberg in me. The main character is a simple peasant who goes courting. He is just like these Finnish fatheads depicted by Runeberg. Albina, l want to show you something. Where are you going? Albina. Darling, let's get married. - l'm afraid... l'll write your father. Do it. Write him. Anything you like. Heavens, you are mad. l didn't realise l would become the marriage broker. You have no idea of the world you live in. You're asking the hand of the daughter of the richest man in town. But Albina wants to get married as well. Bloody hell, Stenvall. Look! ls this really what you want? Sitting on the sofa with your little wife and smoking cigars - while your people are starving to death in their draughty hovels. Her father hasn't accepted my proposal, l can feel it. Wasn't it over a month ago when you brought the letter here? The life of the Swedish upper-class is just an empty champagne glass. l if anybody know. Look at yourself! Soon you'll be a libertine like me. Don't start talking politics here. - You bloody bourgeois. l want nothing to do with your kind. How strange. lt is just a poor lyre playing here alone. l thought l heard discord between two lutes. Mrs. Rosencrantz. Excuse me for coming without previous notice. l couldn't take it anymore. What is the situation with my marriage plans? l couldn't forget such an important matter. Would you like some brandy? Music, please. ln my house important affairs are never handled without a shot or two. Relax. Alexis, may l call you by that sweet name? l must speak frankly with you. Woman to man. You are shaking, Alexis. l am also very exited. You knew it. l am an emotional woman. The answer is no. You must be strong. lt's not the end of the world. You have plenty of choices, you are young and strong. You must realise that a man who doesn't even have a pin in his cap - isn't good enough for Albina. Alexis Stenvall becomes neither a bourgeois nor a priest. He develops into a Finnish writer and changes his name to Aleksis Kivi. ll Act The language dispute of 1 863 The tsar is on the Finnish speakers' side and is promising them benefits. How can one govern this country - with the language of farm-hands and shit drivers? Alexis. Dear friend, where have you been? - What do you want? Your friends are asking about you. Why have you been shunning us? lsn't it obvious. Clearly l'm not a city gentleman. l am now Aleksis Kivi, a tailor's son from the country. Our dominating position which goes back to the Viking Age is threatened. lt's necessary and natural that the Swedish-speakers rule this country. Besides, it is important - that we at least spiritually belong to Western Europe instead of Russia. You are late, Stenvall. You are certainly Vikings, you pro-Swedish students. Only thing missing is sabres. The Language Decree is an insult to the Swedish intelligentsia. lt is a threat to our culture, like barbarians to the Romans. That's rubbish! You are idiots! You are estranged to reality. You have never known it, you live in your naive Viking dreams. This country is much more than you. You may be part of it but you can never represent it by yourselves. Shut up, Stenvall! Look. lt's Lax, Mr. Henrik Salmon-Lax, Runeberg's arse-licker. Show us what you're made of, Lax, flash a bit of that salmon meat. Here he is. The famous Finnish rhymer and the author of Kullervo. ls this the Hegelian flag-bearer of the Fennomen? This pitiful creature who has decided to unite the commons by writing? lf that happens we will move to the better side of the gulf - and take our money with us. We'll see where they'll find money to build this unique culture. What is this meeting? This is a fatal game. lf you are talking politics here - you will be sent straight away to Siberia. Believe me boys - l think - l alone am the one best qualified to determine your interests. l, Fredrik Cygnaeus, professor of this university. You may leave. Stenvall, could you stay? Or is Kivi the name you address yourself by these days? l am the professor of aesthetics as you may well know. When you wrote Kullervo based upon the mythology of Kalevala - l knew it would be a noteworthy event in Finnish literature. We at the university were waiting for your next work. We Finnish-speakers wished it would be written in Finnish. Fredrik! Are you alright? l called the gendarmes when l heard people talking politics. ls this him? lt was a false alarm. This is Aleksis Kivi, the author of Kullervo. Him? l see. Nice to meet you. l noticed you when you got an award for your short story Eriika. l was in the jury then and voted for you. l am August Ahlqvist, the professor of Finnish at this university. l can help you improve your texts, especially into Savolax dialect. Despite being fluent, your writing is mistakenly based on Häme dialect. Savolax would be desirable for the development of our language. Are you the same Ahlqvist that cried down my poem in the paper? Was it yours? lt arrived under a pseudonym. lt was my poem. So thank you very much. l'll leave you two chatting amongst yourselves - with your lovely dialect of Savolax. Fredrik! He's mocking me. l am the greatest authority on Finnish language in this country. No one speaks it like l do. That was a big mistake. You shouldn't have done it. August Ahlqvist is a powerful man. His father is a governor for the power elite. Without the approval of that fool an artist can't make it in this country. Congratulations! You couldn't have found a more powerful enemy. He was already my enemy. Stop that shooting. What the hell are you shooting for? Wolves. They've become so brazen that they come into the yard. Last night they took the dog. Where has Mr. Stenvall been for the last couple of weeks? My name is Aleksis Kivi now. You came here as Mr. Stenvall. Why did you give up that nice name? lsn't it terrible to give up your own name? l've given up a lot more than anybody else. Do you understand anything about guns, sir? Please go in and set the table, Amanda. Let's have a cup of coffee. lt'll make your nerves stronger. You look so pale. May l ask how your writing is going? l haven't been well. Did you hear that they ended the war in America and freed the negros. Who will do the work now when the slaves are running free? l thought about getting a couple of them to work for me. l could keep them in a lockup in the stable at night. This is mister Skog, a farmer. He is a widow and comes here often. This is my tenant, mister Kivi. Ask Mr Kivi - what he does for a living? l write. Does mr. Kivi think writing is work? Work is done in the fields and woods. l know work. When l go hunting, l also bring something home. l just feel that my mission is to write. What kind of stories do you scribble in that cottage? l'm writing a play in Finnish called Heath Cobblers. ln Finnish? Swedish is the language of this country. Finnish is! Soon it will be the official language of schools also. God dammit. My children will never go to a school like that. l think they'll have to because there will be no other schools. Then they will not go to school. Calm down. He is a student and an artist who came here to write in the peaceful country. The senate announces that a state literary contest will be held. The significance of the honour - inspires the awakening of literature and culture of Finland. Listen Törnroos. - What? There has been criticism against the Fennomen's rights in the papers. They have started a campaign for Runeberg's play. We must do our part to make sure Runeberg doesn't win. He'll win if we don't do anything. We must contrive a scheme where we tell the Swedish off. What can we do? - Kivi's Heath Cobblers is the best. What? The Heath Cobblers? Remember that we Fennomen vote for him. Topelius and his friends will of course vote for Runeberg's piece. lt has its merits but a Finnish work must win now. Even the Tsar demands equality between the two languages. They'll think we are monsters who take the award away from a cripple. Runeberg being a cripple has nothing to do with this. He also has a lot of money left from that petition of citizens. He's got money to spend and he has definitely spent some. What about Ahlqvist's poems? - Ahlqvist's poems? Please welcome Senator J.V. Snell Good evening. This will be an exciting night. We have come here to see who has won the Finnish literature championship. This will be an unforgettable night. l wonder if they already know the winner. lt is obvious that Runeberg is the winner. He always gets all the awards. But this award is for young and promising writers. He is our greatest writer. His participation only increases the quality of this contest - and is an honour to anyone to be able to compete in the same league. Johan Ludvig Runeberg. But seriously speaking. Think if you win. 2500 marks is a lot of money, even in a professor's wallet. Professor Cygnaeus has just arrived with the jury's announcement. That's Cygnaeus. Yes, that is Cygnaeus. Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Fennomen. Ladies Snellman, Runeberg, Ahlqvist. lt is a day of joy. Hurrah Runeberg! Today is a joyous day to us Fennomen. A Finnish work has won the state award for literature. Oh my. Thank you. Oh my God. Johan Ludvig Runeberg, you are the greatest of our writers. l want to apologise and ask for a blessing for my work as a poet. Fucking hell. Maybe this is the time for the new generation to rise - and take over the reigns of the Finnish literature. New winds are blowing in Finnish literature and art. They are blowing straight from the Heath Cobblers' arse. The winner is A. Kivi. Bloody hell. Hurrah Aleksis Kivi! It is easy to see, replied Don Quixote - that you haven't acquainted yourself with the adventure. Listen to how Cervantes writes. Aleksis, what are you ranting and raving about? He thought windmills were giants. This is how he describes life. Have you gone totally mad? Madness. There is madness in everyone of us. lt seems that here you have more than your share of it. That's what l'm going to write about. A story of seven brothers, a bit mad and child-like. Just like this Don Quixote. Don Kito? Was he also mad? Mad people are under God's protection and shouldn't be mocked. l am not mocking them and neither is Cervantes. Certainly not but l am laughing. You can always laugh. l am Emil Nervander and l'm coming from Helsinki. This is student Nervander. Charlotta Lönnqvist, my landlady and Amanda. l want to tell you, Aleksis, that l love you. Let me embrace you. - Hell, don't. Can't you see? You have beaten them all. You have won the whole damned contest. He has won the contest. - What contest? Aleksis. You have beaten Runeberg himself. Me? That is Kaarlo Bergbom, he was on your side in the jury. So you owe him some of your honour. Dear friend, let me introduce you to Aleksis Kivi. You are the only talented one here. Congratulations! Why don't you write plays and l'll set up a theatre. A Finnish theatre. l hear big words being used here. This is indeed the time for them. This is a historical moment. Let's toast to Aleksis Kivi and the birth of the Finnish culture. That birth is now. l also want to introduce senator Snellman to Mr Kivi. He would like to say something even though he doesn't speak Finnish. Lönnrot created for us a magnificent past with the Kalevala - and Kivi will cultivate the language for the future with his literature. Based on that language Snellman and others will build you a nation. From now on we can be proud of being Finnish. No longer shall we be ashamed alongside other civilised nations. Skoal. No, cheers! Skoal! Our land Finland, our fatherland Let the sweet words echo high No valley nor hill l have a surprise for you. Come. l had to see you. Did you ask your parents for permission? Their permission doesn't concern me anymore. l have left everything. My life is worthless without you. l have learned my lesson. Finnish people don't need Russian oppressors because we have our own. l thought you loved me. lf love would fill our stomachs and pay our rent - l and the other have-nots might be more interested in it. But my heart for bliss is throbbing And my brow shines bright as heaven, For I stand here with my lass On the top of the mossy mountain, For the night is gone, For the summer morning glimmers And the birds they are singing. Aleksis. Juhani, what are you doing here? - lt's Father. What? Speak Finnish. - God dammit, Aleksis. You must come with me. Father is ill. l can't go anywhere. l have won a literary award and we are having a party. You may be a good writer but you can't write your way out of this. Will you also go see Saint Peter with a pen in your hand? You weren't there for Mother when she needed you. Now you'll come with me before you kill Father, too. What happened? lt's a bit late to ask that. Father. l am not writing for lords and ladies. l'm writing about the commonality. l am writing for the people. l am not doing it for me. Father, please forgive me. Years of famine Frost destroys the harvest over a period of years. ln 1 868 1 40 000 people starve to death. lll Act Seven Brothers What will you have? Cigars, tobacco? l have something to show you. Heatherland... Poetry. Printed these yourself, have you? ln Finnish? Yes, and financed from my own pocket. Who did you think was going to buy these? People. Listen young man, there are two kinds of people. Ones that buy books and others who can't even afford to buy food. Only the latter read Finnish and that doesn't help you. Haven't you seen that this country is not doing well? Finnish people are starving. They are dying like flies. Unfortunately l can't take these. l haven't even sold the old stock. The house is going under the hammer. Whose fault is it? A swindler, the one living here. A bloody Finn who just idles around in the fields. He's living here with full board entirely for free. That bloody Finn! What is going on here? l am the law counsellor. l have come to recover debts. Miss Lönnqvist has mortgaged her house as security. lf the debt is not paid the house must go under the hammer. This isn't the only place where people are suffering. The crops have failed everywhere in the country. These women are good hard-working people and - will pay their debt once they get on to their feet. You must be Kivi, their tenant. This Skog says that you have been staying here for free. People are talking about illicit intercourse. God dammit. A bailiff sneering at good people. Skog says that you have been playing the master here. l'm no master but l am a writer. My next work will be published soon. lt will revolutionise everything in this country. Tell the debtors that l will get you the money. Throw the weight off your chest. The air that I breathe... lt's Throw the weight off your chest. Good. Alright iron bars. Here is Charlotta Raa, a great actress from Sweden. Very good. lf you lift your eyebrows you will make the role more natural. Then you inhale as deep as you can. With the words I breathe you will exhale like the flow of life. Like this. Excuse me Mr Bergbom. Emil. Aleksis Kivi has arrived. Marvellous news.The opening premiere of the Finnish theatre is your play Lea. Bergbom managed to get Charlotta Raa for the main role. She is even acting in Finnish. This is simply great. Charlotta Lönnqvist is the most noble person in the world. First she wouldn't let me pay rent - and now she has mortgaged the house as security. She is about to lose everything because of me. Kivi! Dammit. The great poet himself has arrived. Look, children. Here is a great man indeed. Aleksis Kivi. He is creating culture for this God-forsaken nation. You have been so productive lately that we have lost count. Eriika, Kullervo, Heath Cobblers, Betrothal- Runaway, Alma, Night and Day and of course Lea, your latest play. Kaarlo, l need money. l can't write if l have to work at the farm. You mustn't give up. Things will work out on their own. The Finnish Theatre will also open soon. l'm writing something different. lt's a novel about seven men. This is the life work Snellman ordered from me. Magnificent. Did you hear that? Bravo! Why don't you go to bed? And you are still wearing your overcoat. At least take it off. Have you been drinking again? You smell of liquor. Why do you have to drink? Leave me alone. Why are you always hassling me? Can't you see that l have to work and get paid? Nobody is going to buy my work if nobody wants to read it. And nobody will read my work if it isn't good. And it is not going to be good if you keep interrupting me. You know l don't understand Finnish. - You don't. You don't understand that l work to pay your debt - so that we could live just a moment in peace. l'm truly waiting for that rest. But you never will and never have understood what l am really doing. You are not Finnish like l am. That's why you will never understand who l am and what l am doing. Aleksis Kivi. Seven Men. Damn it. Hell and damnation. Can't l do any better? And that's when the devil whistled. Two leather horns broke their way through the wall. They started shouting and screaming like lions. Hail, brown barley juice, Hail, strong foaming cheer! Damn it. No more. No more. Break the window and up the hill! Jussi's pouch just swinging. At a small window The bobtail dozes And the birds sing him When the day closes... And the birds sing him When the day closes... Snug the squirrel lies In his mossy lair Where no tooth of Frost Nor the hunter's snare Have ever reached. Max and Vux. l have to start all over. l have to write even better. Damn! Seven Brothers Aleksis! What are you doing there? Open the door. Let's take him to the sauna. l'll take the script to Cygnaeus. He has promised to read it. And Bergbom as well. They are your friends, after all. Have you seen Ahlqvist's review on Kivi's Seven Brothers? What about it? He must have cried it down like everything he has written. But this time he's gone too far. Has anyone ever published a book so full of abuse - swearing, invectives, cruelty and blasphemy as Kivi's latest. Don't worry about it. Have a drink and sit down. Ahlqvist is not the only one who opposes to the book. The Fennomen are demanding a popular and easily comprehensible literature. Piss off, Kaarlo! That paper favours Ahlqvist's scribbles - because they are mediocre and harmless. How can one paper so grossly favour the elite intelligentsia? Don't try to change the way of the world. This is how it has always been and this is what it will likely be. l see a lot of Kivi's so-called friends watching with delight - when Ahlqvist is crying down his masterpiece. Oh dear. Suddenly l don't feel too well. Kivi paid all his debts to me from his commission. He is a gone man. You gave him an award and asked him to create Finnish literature. And he did it. You thought it would take twenty years but he did it in seven. He wrote the first proper play, the first proper poem book - and his greatest piece, the first Finnish novel - which is just as fine a work as Cervantes' Don Quixote. ln it Finns are depicted the way they are for the first time. Seven Brothers is Finnish history in miniature. lt is the heroic tale of this nation. And this is the writer you let rot in an insane asylum. Lapinlahti Mental Asylum 1 8 72 He is not mad - the way people usually are mad. His sick-list is long. He's had a typhoid, deficiency disease. And lately he has been drinking heavily. He is there. l have come to get with your brother and your niece. Dear Charlotta Everything is better now. Let us be happy and brave and trust in God. Let us live piously so that we could meet in another bett Keep well. Send my love to Amanda. Your Aleksis.
