Now get back to your bench (mumbles) and get back to work. - I ought to, send you down to the office. Got sick and tired of your face. Now, get back to work. Or you are getting so shaky hands with this again. - I still wonder why we gotta do this. - Because you lot, are the best qualified for the job, Carson. - I'd swear that dummies made. - So we should be getting paid. - Excuse me sir. Your fly seems to be undone. (bell ringing) - When you learn how it operates (mumbles). - Forget it. - Hey, you heard me, get to class. Do you wanna talk about it?

Oi, yeah, yeah (mumbles). - Awesome. - What are you lot hanging around for? What have you got there (mumbles)? - Here, this, is already brought straight from Hong Kong. Look at campus., it's great. - Shut up Carson. Aah, very interesting. You can take a little walk with me. - Yeah, we can walk. - Oh look, this is a big man. He stopped the show. (mumbles) - No, can we just... (whack sound) - I don't want to see your face again son. I'm sure you don't want to see mine. Now get back to your class. Tell Mr. Melvin, you had a little brush with the law. Nice taking care of the monkey. Now I'm about to have a little chat with you Hogan Rhonda. Come over here Carson. Why is it Carson, that every time I look out my window, I see you, being trailed around by an entourage of every none no hobo in the establishment? Why is that do you think? Like, customers of yours Carson. - Look, what do you mean sir? - What I mean son, is I'm very curious about this matchbox. And I've come up with a silly idea that you might know where it came from Carson. - Well, I don't know sir. - I suppose you don't know what this is either. - I'm not too sure sir. - Stand over there Carson. I want you to start disrobing. - What sir? - Get your clothes off. - What's all this for sir? - Would you like a tap to get you started? - No sir. - Then get your clothes off. Now I'm more interested in what's in the trousers. (coins jingling) What's all these Carson? Your lunch money. Now, you better start doing some extra fast talking son. - Well, that's my mother's shopping money sir. - What kind of mother would trust you with $50, Carson? - 50? There should be $60 in there sir. - It's not been teaching mathematics for 20 years son. I don't need you to inform me that five 10s are 60. - Oh, sorry Mr.Yates. - Get your clothes on. (flesh smacking) Other hand. (flesh whacking) I usually start with four Carson. In your case, I felt enthusiastic. I know you're a liar, and I know what you're doing. And I know I'm going to catch you at it. (bangs locker) And that'll be the last we see of you Carson. Just tell your teacher you had a little brush with the law. - Sir before I go, can I get some of the money please? - You are one foot on a banana skin son. - Thanks sir. - Go on. - My name is Sharon Hart. As you can see I'm new. I'd like to get to know all of your names, but I'll probably forget as soon as you tell me. What's yours? - Steven. - All right, Steven. - Joanne. - Joanne. - Warren Milan, miss. - All right Milan. - Harry. - Harry. - What's your name? - Oh, Peter Brodkiewiez. - Peter. - Are you a part of this class? - Yeah, I guess bring down the sealed city. (laughter) - What city? - Yeah they're definitely young. - I see. - Did you have a little brush with the law, did ya? - Well, no doubt Mr.Swindon must have-- - What did he do to you? - Told you to be ready. - Because this term-- He gave you a whips? - Yeah, six. That bastard. - We're gonna be doing a reading course. - He had to teach us how to read. - Not a chance of teaching you now. - I was hoping you might be able to read for real. (mumbles) - I was afraid-- - Who's that? - Sharon Hart and Harris. - The challenges going out of course. (hysterical laughter) - He says he's my boyfriend. - Aah, you've seen them. - What's the matter you jealous or something? - Is to help you with your reading, to get ready for the final exams. So that you become more efficient readers, more effective readers. - Aah, so we can read the exam by this year. (students laughing) It'd be really handy. - Who is she? - Miss Hart, Miss Fart I don't know. I think she's a student. - Just waiting on you two up at the back. - She's probably opposite. - I find it very hard, to walk into a room full of strangers and just start teaching. I really need to get to know you a bit. - Bruce Shweikert is the name. - Look Bruce, just shut up all right, and give her a go. - Thank you. And you need to get to know me. I mean, there's a strong possibility, we don't even speak the same language. - You're a (mumbles). (laughing) - We might use different words, different expressions. I don't know yet. (bell rings) Maybe that's a place to start next time. It's all right, but (mumbles) upside down. (movements in the classroom) Nobody leaves until I announce that is over. Get back to your seats. - (mumbles). - Who was that? - Probably its Carson. (distant loudspeaker) (rattling sound) (tense music) (door slams) - Where's the money? - Here, 50 bucks. - 50 bucks, where's the rest? - That's all. I got interrupted. - Don't tell me I'm gonna have to turn you upside down again. I'm getting sick of that. - Me too. - Looks like I got to keep them up then ay? - That cost me six cuts today. - That's why it's safe in my pocket ay. - If you don't give me 10 bucks, you're gonna be selling the stuff yourself alright? - Okay, I'll tell you what little buddy. Hold onto your five bucks, how is that? - Dead shit. (car hooting) - [Ladies] Hey, shit heads. (laughing) (Car engine sound) (car brakes screeching) - You wait here. - You were supposed to be here yesterday. - Hey. - (mumbles). - Hey, watch the shirt. Mate, it's a new shirt. - Where is the stuff? - Put your hands-- - Do you wanna con me? - (mumbles) and I'll give it you. Look at that, you got (mumbles) shit all over it. - Next time-- - Then we're gonna get better. - You make a phone call to me. Off you go. (closes the car door) - All right, all right. (soft music) - A man died trying to start that machine. You could get yourself killed too. Trying to knock stuff out of my yard. (breathing heavily) - Piss off. Let me go. - I don't know whether to give you a swoop ring or get the cop outside where I let them do it. - Look I wasn't trying to nick it I was just polishing it for ya. - What's going on Redback? What's this like finger little worm being doing? Told you not to get out of the fucking car, didn't I ay? - Oi, listen you can piss off. One more thing Earl, don't bring smack into my yard, understand? You and Jerry got business, you do it somewhere else. - Sure - You're walking home boy. - You are related to that (mumbles)? - He is my brother. - He got your best interests at heart, has he? - What? - Nothing. What are we gonna do about this here? What do you want to know before you collect them do you? - Oh yeah I'm gonna have 40 at the house. - Oh, you a bit of a bike man ay? - Oh, yeah, I'm getting one myself. - Gonna knock it off bit by bit. Come on here. - Shit! What's this? - This is a red bike Phoenix mate. It's one of made customised Black boot. - Where did you get it from? - Well, all the things sort of rose up, out of all that dead metal out there in the yard. And of the front end, it's all from Mr.Smith. The rears of a (mumbles). Your mother needed a man or boss. (mumbles). (Carson laughing) Was not gonna get back down. I got a man coming in here tomorrow who wants to throw his leg over this thing. Tell you what, why don't you come around on the weekend when I got a bit more time to show you what goes on? - What for? - I don't know. I just thought you might be interested in seeing how I knock one of those together. - Oh yeah, that'll be great. I better be going now. See ya. - What's your name? - Steve. (dog barking) (children playing) (birds chirping) - Excuse me, madam. (laughing ) - What are you hanging around for? You useless mate. You couldn't run out of sight in a dark night. - What's going on? What's going on? - What do you bloody think is going on? - Where is mom going? - Why don't you ask you freaking mother. (bird crowing) - Hey, what about the ariel Kirk? That gotta go to? - No bloody (mumbles) it's not. - I thought mom paid for the TV? - Shut up. - It's on our list. - Why don't you go and take that Mongolia for a walk. Go on, piss off. - Hey! - Lynn, hey Lynn. - She's not getting that son. (chuckles) - We're just following instructions mate. - I don't care. You are not getting that bloody TV mate. (man shouting) Your not get this TV mate. This is my TV! This is mine! (birds crowing) (Parrot speaking) (man quarrelling) (tense music) - Shit! (upbeat music) (cat purring) (dog barking) (Carson panting heavily) - Oh, shit. Get over hear, come on. - He is stubborn. (mumbles). - Bye Mrs.Stout. - Oh, take your dog out of my yard. Get out. (mumbles). - No worries about Mrs. Stout. - Get out. - Come on (mumbles). - Here, here Snowball. Puss, come here, puss. - (Carson's voice) Dear Steve, I'm sorry I had to leave in a hurry, without saying a proper goodbye. Things between your father and me, have gotten much worse lately. I thought I was gonna get murdered, if I stay there any longer. If you look under the refrigerator, you'll find $10 that I've left for you. Make sure you get it before your father finds it. See you soon. I'm thinking of you. Love, mom. - You okay? - (mumbles), I'm pissed off that's all. - What do you mean? - She's going out to this place I don't know. Designs a cake shop. - A cake shop? - You think that's funny do you? I don't know what's gonna happen. - Don't worry about it. Things got better when my own mom left home. - You weren't looking at the map on the back wall, - It's Brodkiewiez sir. - Just turn around and face the front line. - Yes sir. - Number five, the Savanna Lands. - Hey Steve - Piss off will ya? - (mumbles) - You wanna see something fantastic. - What? - Just have a look. Come on, you gotta lean right over. - Number six, the (mumbles) River. - Oh fuck! - Carson, what the hell do you think you're doing boy? - Just stopping by sir. - Well, I don't think you're falling into that lap son. Now turn around, and sit down in that chair before I knock you off it. - Yes sir - Get your mind, what's left of it, back on the (mumbles)? - Yes sir. - Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir. (students laughing) - Smart ass. - Eh. - How come they picked you for this? What would you know about cricket? - Enough. - What, your boyfriend teach you, did he? Oh sorry miss, I thought you would have a boyfriend by now. Look, you don't have to know how to play cricket. The only thing you have to do, is mark off your own feet, then take off on you. - Nothing I can't handle there. - What would you do if we do take off? - Report you. - You are a double aren't you? - No I'm a teacher. - Ah you deep shit. (laughing) - Take this. - Nice catch Dougy, lovely face appeal their mate. - Now put it away. - There you guys (shouting) - Forget about him miss, he hasn't played cricket all year. - (mumbles) Shweikert. (welding) - You are awesome. - Yeah, but I got smart. - Is that you on the floor? - Yeah. - What happened? You crashed? - Every one of that game, comes unstuck sooner or later. When you walk life in a line like that, you fight your old father's advice. Good enough for us. - Were you good or were you helpless? - I had some luck, nothing spectacular. I didn't give a damn about nothing back then. 'Cause I needed them for the charge. Seems you're all right when you don't give a shit. And (mumbles) when it all matters too much. Do you wanna have a crack at it? - Oh I don't know. - What do you mean no? I thought that's why you was coming around. - On this? - No. Here, we are all in this. (metal cranking) (welding) Here, (mumbles). All right, here we go. You can get this one. (welding) - How much does it cost to make a bike? - It depends on what you are doing. You're not certified. - I just wanna know how much it can cost. - (mumbles) some basis. five or 600. - Five or 600? - Yeah, it will be right way out of your league mate. (mumbles) if you get it. Its going to depend on what you're doing. (phone ringing) - Miss Hart tells me you got lost on the way to the cricket ground again, Carson. Come in here and we'll sort this out. - Hope you enjoy it. - I'm sure I will. - Team G, I'd like you all to Meet Mr.Curry. He is coming here, especially today, from the Teachers College. - Thank you Miss Hart. Morning girls? Boys? - Good morning, Mr.Curry. - Would you like to sit down sir? - All right thank you. - Last time, remember, we were having a look at the ways in which people can communicate without using words. Using body language alone. We also discussed the different bodily gestures and signs that people use. Often without even realising they're doing it. Like you all pointed out that when I get fed up with you, I fold my arms, and raise my eyes, to the ceiling and roll them. Remember I asked you all to be prepared to come out to the front, with a partner. - Pass to the volunteers. - And act out short communication without using words. How do you write it? - TWRS. - Now I don't want anything complicated. Like I said, just a short communication using gestures. - You can tell us, it's nothing (mumbles). - Any volunteers? Or should I just go ahead and choose somebody? Liz. Would you like... No. - Miss, there's something you should be aware of. There've been, communications, passing up and down. Between various members of the class over there. And I think, that this should be brought to your attention. - Did you see a small boy right around the corner? - He is in the loo. Mr little smart ass, why did you do that to me? Why? - Sorry, Mr.Sweden. - Excuse me. - Why did you do it? - Well, you shouldn't have told Yates. - What do you think that lesson meant to me? You don't know, do you? - I was not expecting you so well. - Well, you and your smart ass friends screwed that up, didn't you? - Well I told you you shouldn't have told Yates - You skipped school, I turned you in. I was doing my job, nothing personal. You expected it. In fact, I think you even enjoy it. I think you'd be locked, if somebody wasn't trying to catch you out. But the stupid thing about it all, is that nobody really cares what you do. They've written you off maybe. - Oh, I'll come and give you stuff. - I know (Bell ringing) You're not gonna get away with writing me off. - I'll stop or I'll be late for geography ay Miss. - Go on, get out of here. - It's vacant now sir. (engine roaring) (birds crowing) - You want it? You can have it. - What you giving it away for? - Cause sooner or later, you'd be stealing one. Couple of things you don't know about me, pal. Well I've done some time. Spent a few years in the nick when I was a kid. - Oh yeah, what happened? - You think that's really something, don't you? Just goes to show how full of shit you are mate. (birds crowing) I stole a bike. This new Harley. Took it straight off the street. Just couldn't keep me hands off it. And I ride it from here, to The Alice Springs - No bull - All day, all night. And I nearly got away with it. And that cost me three years. Boys home, jail a lot. - I wasn't gonna knock off no bike. - Oh, you're done after now do ya? Still, you're gonna have to hustle for a few bucks if you wanna make anything out of that. - Not a problem. (soft rock) (car engine roaring) - Here mate. - Thanks a lot. - Got the Herald? - Yeah. Thanks. (paper rustling) (children chattering) - Neil Anguin. - Sir - Vicky Arnold. - She's fantastic. - Vicky Arnold - Here sir. - Attention. (mumbles) Barns. - Mr.Dawn. - Andrew Brodkiewiez. - Present sir. - Put that desk down, and sit up. - Steven Carson. - Yeah. Where's Carson? I'll see you at recess Shweikert. (students chattering) - Steven George Carson. 17 ay? - Yeah - Okay, take a seat over there We'll call you in a few minutes. - Thanks mate. - So the last six months, you've been working as a mechanic at, Redbacks's graveyard? - Yes that's right. - Now what exactly were you doing there? - You know, usual stuff. - What's the usual stuff? - Oh yeah, a bit of welding a bit of mechanic stuff, you know. - Are you comfortable? - Oh, yeah. - So, what went wrong? - Oh he couldn't afford. Too many bikers working for him now. - So he just had to let you go ay? - Yeah, he never wanted to though. - Is there a phone number that we could ring? If we needed say, to make some inquiries? - Well, what do you mean? - Well, some future employer might like to know a few things about you. I want a reference or something. Might like to know the circumstances under which you left. So we need a phone number. It'll be in the book I suppose. - Well, I won't get any name now. It's a bad time for it. - I just want you to find the number for me that's all. - Yeah. - How old are you? - 17. Yeah, I do look a bit old for my age. - You mean a bit young for your age. Do you know what I think? I think you are lying. I think you should still be in school. Go on, get out of here now. Or I'll have you charged. - (mumbles). - Thanks. - Wanna smoke Moose? - No I'm too thirsty. - That's sharp, where did you get it? - It's for you, it's a present. - So that, it's all gold. - Why has it got a W on it? - That's the brand. - Looks nicked to me. - Give us a break. (water sprinkling) - Oh, look he's wet him. (laughing) - You're a clown Moose. - You bloody young idiot. - Oh, sorry, sir. - Still got that (mumbles). (disco music) - If you are under 18, you're not permitted by law in this area of the hotel. - Hey, I think we got a problem. - Look no worries. - Oh, come on, what's the mater? - Come on Steve, you don't even look 50. (laughing) - Thanks a lot Vick. (mumbles). - I think we'll be going rollerskating after all. - Wrong place kid, this is a hotel. - What's the problem? - The problem is you look about 13 to me. - 13 You must be joking. Listen mate, I come here all the time. (mumbles), go ask him if you don't believe me. You let me in last time yourself remember. I was wearing a white shirt. Look, (mumbles). - Piss off kid. (♪ I wanna be you baby playing by James Freud) - Hey! - Come now. - Hey, what you doing? - I'm kissing you. - Okay, what is this? What did you do it for? - I just wanted to. - Oi, cut it out. What are you two doing? - You are my mate, we are not like that. - Then what are we ? - I don't know, friends. Don't be dumb. - Friends? - What's the matter with you? We've been hanging around for four years, and then all of a sudden you start coming on. What do you expect? (distant music) - Vick girl, what a waste of time. - What happened? - She gave me the ass didn't she? - Oh yeah that's women for you. Look, she's been giving me a hard time too. - You? You're never in the run. - Look, forget it. She's got her heart for that Harris mate. - Look I don't wanna know. - Saw her kiss him at lunchtime. - Shut up. Had her tongue right down his throat. - Shut up - And his hand right up on her dress. - Shut your face Moose. - Both hands grabbing her tits. Steve let me up! - Or what will happen, I can't hear mate. (train hooting) (yells angrily) - All right, what's all the smoke? - Hey ya! - Come on. - Hold him! (panting heavily) - You not going in? - Sit down. - Did you see a couple of kids coming in? - Drop your pants. (trickling sound) - Okay, where is he? - What are you talking about? - Sorry. - The boy. (mumbles) the boy. - Get out. - Excuse me. - You gotta be joking. I was just having a pee, wasn't I? - Excuse me. (upbeat music) - Watch where you go. (upbeat music) (rattling sound) - (mumbles). - Make an arrangement. Excuse me. - Steven? - Amy, she told me to turn up. - Yes, but I didn't expect you to show. Right after our little... - See you Sharon. - Pascal. I just wanted to have a word with you. - What about miss? - About some of the trouble you're in. - I'm not in no trouble. - Now that's not the story I've heard. Look, Steve, I know what you're doing. - How do you mean? - I've heard, that you've been passing yourself off as an employer off down at the CAS. Big future in that. And Mr.Yates is under the impression you're running the marijuana business in the school. But I won't go into that one. You must be aware, that just about every teacher in the school, is after you for one thing or another. You skip their lessons, you steal everything that isn't nailed down, you tell lies, and you put a lot of dumb tricks and you don't face up to anything. - I know what you do too. I saw you and Harrison there. - Nothing escapes you. Look, I don't know if you plan to stick around and finish the year out. I don't know if your school certificate means anything to you. - I don't care. - Well believe me, I don't think they're gonna let you get that far. They plan to get rid of you. - How do you know that? - Because they plan to get rid of me. So just be careful, huh. (metal clanking) - How do you know which one to tighten? - Just watch. See that? - Yeah. - That one. - Oh, you are bullshitting me. You are just guessing you are. - Listen pal, you got to pay attention to this. This side still. (clanging of metal) (beeping sound) - They're on special 99 cents. (machine beeping) $1 2,3,4, 5s 10. - Thanks. - Sorry, I should have given you this. I've got too much small change. Can I just swap it for the equivalent on that please? Oh sorry again, I left my girlfriend's phone number on the tender on there. Can I just have a look at it please? - Well that'd be a tragedy. - Wait a minute, what are you trying to pull? - Nothing. - Go on, piss off or I call the manager. - Who showed you how to do that? - Big brother Earl, I know a few things he knows. - And that's your mother isn't it? (whistles) - Hey mom. (car honking) Hey mom, what are you doing here? - Oh I can't talk to you now love, can't you see? - What did you do your hair? - Why? Don't you like it? - So when you are you coming back? - Look I don't know, a lot of things are a bit of a miss right now. How are things with you and your father? - All right. - Look you got something I can write on. (car honking) I'm in a terrible hurry. - Oh, here. - I'll give you my number. - What did you put in your hair? That looks ridiculous. - No, thanks very much. Bye, bye. - I'll see if I can ring you up tonight. - All right. (engines roaring) - Hey Cassie. - Please welcome. - Hey mate, give us the daily. - Yes. - That's him, he's the one. (car engine roaring) (laughing) - What can I do for you fellas? - We wanna see a young bloke of yours, called Steven Carson. - I'm not surprised. What's he done? Now get your big whole fat out of my flowers, you gloat. You trample my (mumbles) son, it will be the last step you ever take. Not a bad display, what do you say? We took out second prize in the Herald Gardening Competition last year, the Southern division. - Yeah, very impressive. So when can we see Carson? - When you seen him, you can feed him to the lions as far as I'm concerned. Oh, I'm sorry mate. - No, it's okay. - Hey, take this, will you son? Just follow me. Come on. - All right, Bryce, what have you brought in today? - Condoms. (laughing) - So lets hear the instructions. - Carefully tear off in the foil pack. (laughing) And roll into (mumbles), off the sheath, and squeeze tip size to leave empty space to collect semen. (laughing) - I thought you were supposed to have a reading problem. - You've got to read directions mate, you shouldn't be using them. - Before intercourse, roll onto Eric-- (laughing) - Erect mate, erect. - Penis. (laughing) - Sorry to interrupt you Miss Hart. What's this? I thought you're supposed to be helping with their reading. - I am, they are reading directions? - Yes, well sounds more like family planning to me. I can tell you that, they don't need any help with that. Understood. Anyway, we'll talk about this later. - Steve, is not here. - Where's he gone? He skipped your lesson? (rattling sound) Where's your mate Carson Bryce? There's no need to look son, he doesn't appear to be in the room. (tense music) (rattling sound) Who was sitting here? - What do you mean sir? - I mean, about one minute ago. (tense music) Thank you Mr.Shweikert. (students laughing) Thanks very much. See you later. - Okay, you can sit down. - I've measured out my life, with coffee spoons. (tense music) I know the voice is dying, like a dying fall, beneath the music from a further room. So, how should I presume? - Go get your shit. - Just a minute now. Not you too (mumbles). Sprogis and Harris only. (dramatic music) - Hey, Carson! Come on Carson! I want you. - Uurgh! Sprogis! - Come here! (yelling) (dramatic music) - Come on, come on. - I'm sorry about this boy. But as soon as we pick him up, I'll hand him over to you. Good afternoon Carson. - Hi sir. - Is this him? (objects cluttering) (mumbles) - 200 bucks worth of newspaper (mumbles)? Jesus Christ, where did all that bloody money go ay? (slap smacking) (yelling) - I spend it on me bike, didn't I? - Don't bloody answer me back. What the bloody hell is this? Ah, don't tell me your hidden the pieces well? - Cause for you it's a prison. - I suppose you knocked it off. - No, its the money I owned. - Oh, shit! Shit! (drunk murmurs) Jesus Christ. I don't know what's the matter with you. I can't pay for this. (mumbles). I don't bloody know why I always keep hitting you son. I guess a man is just a bloody night hopper. (mumbles) a couple of night hoppers, huh? - Its Steve. - Who? - Steve Carson, I wanna talk to me mom. - Well she's not bloody here. - Yeah, right. - I got something more profitable for you. - What? Smack? I'm not touching it. - There's no problem. You don't have to find the customers, you just deliver. I've been getting some inquiries from the guys around your school. - Well, I'm not touching it. - What you scared are you? - I'm not pushing it at all. I know what that shit does. - No push it. Jesus Christ, who are you? A little Mr.Festival of light. Listen little buddy, this is money we're talking about. Not your piece week $10 a matchbox. I don't like doing either, but I like the money. You're not the one taking the risk. You don't have to arrange nothing. Just do some deliveries. I'll leave it with you, and I'm giving you some names. (smacks his face) (dog barking) - Hang on. (door knocks) (toilet flashing) Hang on, will ya? (opens door) - You take your time well don't you? You've been jerking off in here, have you? - I guess. - Hey Carson, we've been looking for you. Okay now, where's our smack? - I aint got it on me right now. - Al said you just bring it today. - I left it at home. - Lunchtime right, back at the oval. - You don't show up Carson, and you get your head hammered. - Drop it at the club. (angry muttering) - Swallow that spitball less. - I didn't do anything sir. - One hundred thousand unemployed out there, and you want to address yourself to the problem by rolling spitballs. Will say I feel sorry for you people. Because I don't think you're going to be able to cut the mustard once you get past the speed rate. (hysterical laughter) No need to snigger son, it doesn't mean what you think it means. Here, get your hands up on the desk Carson. Something people haven't got the attention span of a cabbage mob. - Thank you sir. - I don't wanna waste my time being so concerned. - Look, you've already given me one sir. - You're the ones with the problem you know? My time is really up. Next year, I'll be happily looking at golf balls, around the course important query. While you, and your know-it-all matesel, might be out scrounging your next meal. (laughing) Who made that smell? Which animal in our midst, was responsible for that vile stink? Get out Shweikert. This isn't a barn yard, I'll deal with you later. - Are you addressing me line? Stop! (laughing) Get outside, and shake yourself. I can see it's pretty clear, I'm wasting time talking to you lot about careers. Maybe, we should spend the next few weeks talking about life on the dough. - What do you know about life on the dough? - Oou, good point there Carson. Probably, the most perceptive contribution you've made all year. But one thing I can guarantee ya, come the end of the year you'll only be authorities in the subject. (bubbling sound) (distant children voices) - She hates the sweat men. - Does she? - Yeah. (chuckles) - Just play it easy. - Who is this? - (mumbles). (violently opens door) - Morning gentlemen, ladies. Snap your cigarette Herald. Hold up on your feet boys. I've got a job for you. - Oi! - Look, what I've got, it's not yet taken. - What am I doing? - I'm giving you mate. Here you go. (dramatic music) - Good thing you showed Carson. - I've kept your promise ain't I? - Yeah, good. (tense music) (angry yelling) - Get Carson! (rattling sound) - Sprogis, where did he go? Round the back, go that way. (tense music) (dramatic music) - (mumbles) Carson. (tense music) - We got him! We got him mate. - Let me go will ya! - Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Mr.Holloway and Mr.Greer. These men, are detectives. They've come all the way from Bombay, and they don't like to waste the trip. Oh Carson, at least we've got you and the evidence this time. So I think you're all going to be extremely cooperative. I doubt, if I'll even have to call upon the assistance of my friend in the cabin. - Okay, thank you, Mr.Yates. But we'd like to have a talk to them now, if you don't mind. All right, it's your call. - Let's go. - This is the evidence? - And this one. - So, how do you get mixed up in this kind of trouble? - Oh, I don't know. I mean, my daddy is a (mumbles) at the Ivy Hemings. Its a factory where they make all these, false creams and all this. And he got the sad news six cents. And now he's got off from both his legs. And he wrote me when he was in hospital getting his arm fixed up. - What's all this got to do with selling marijuana down by the school level? - I'm not selling marijuana, I'm just helping my old man out, of cigarettes and all this. Sorry, I just can't think. - Listen son, I want a few answers. And I want them now. Cause the way it looks to me fella, you're going to be spending the night in the cell. - All those prefects, they... - Are you alright? - They knocked me down. (faints on the floor) - What do you know about the family? - Oh, it's a sad case. Father an alcoholic. - This is crazy. - What's the matter? - The kids blacked out. - What did you do to him? - You got someone in here who knows First Aid? - One of the senior boys might have roughed him up a bit, but he was alright. - Don't worry, I'm all right. - (mumbles) casualty will you? - Knowing Carson he's probably putting on an act. - The kid's been hit on the head, could have internal bleeding, affect his skull, (mumbles). - Is he all right? - So this is the way you handled trouble like, is it? - All right Jeff, let's go. - Go? But the ambulance will be here in 10 minutes. - His breathing is okay, there's no need to panic. - So you're not taking this any further then? - Frank, the kids laying on the floor after? Don't you think you've taken this far enough? - And you're not making any criminal charges? - There's nothing there. - What about the others? What about the drug dealing? - That's entirely up to you, do what you usually do. Beat the shout out of them or suspend them. Its your show. But listen Frank, would you do us a favour? In future, don't bring us all the way out here unless you've got a case. Okay? - Thanks. - Nice fish. - Especially the flat head. (laughing) - Hey there little buddy. What's this I hear about you ripping off some customers of mine. Giving themselves praise and flowers for the smack I gave you. - They choked us. - Ay? - They choked us, not so frightened. - Listen smart ass, I wanna know what happened to my smack. - I flashed it, straight down the shit ass. You can get into looking for if you like. - Fair enough, this should cover it. - You bastard, I told you I wasn't going to sell it. - But don't try messing me around in future ay? For all your trouble little buddy. Cause you are slouchy old man. A good deal would have to be halfway up your ass before you saw it coming. (Dog heavily panting) (Birds crowing) - You got him in? - Yeah, dad. - Yeah boy, he's got a threshing. He's gonna go as if his ass is on fire. (birds crowing) (Radio chanting) Ready. - Shit, sorry. - That's a nil. - What the bloody hell are you doing? Hey! You let them go too soon, you stupid (mumbles). How many of these stuffed bloody rabbits do you think we got? Hey! (Sheep bleating) (Dogs scoffing) - This idiot, come here. Come here. - Go on, put him in. I don't know why we're wasting our time testing that Mongol of yours. What he's good for, is turning steaks into dog shit. And you back it up this time boy, or I'm gonna bloody tie you to the wire. - (mumbles). - Go for it Mexi. - What did you do? Stick something up his ring? (mumbles), tells me he's like your mother his bloody hopeless. Hey! (whistles) (dog barking) (sheep bleating) You useless Mong. - What are you gonna do? - Teaching him to keep his bloody mind on the job. - You better not hurt him. - Piss off. (angry yells) (mumbles) bastard. Come here! (dog barking) - Piss off. - What are you doing? - Go on, piss off to school. - You gonna poison Megs? - (mumbles) huh? You bring that bloody dog back here. - Come on Mexi. (engine reviving) - Run, quick! (whistling) (mumbles) - Come on. - Megs! - Come on get it you Mongrel. You get away from that dog. Piss off! Piss off! Go on, piss off! (car engine roars) - Piss off. - Its me little buddy, Earl. It was a bad thing what he done to you. But you know the old man, after diamond gets himself so pissed he wouldn't know whether it was Pitt street or Christmas. My boss has done worse things to me. Aint no use in crying about it. It's just not good business keeping a dog that can't run. - He could run. - Maybe - See that's the difference between you and me little buddy. You run around acting like the little Crim, which is still too soft. It's just no good getting attached to a stupid dog. See this? This is what I get attached to. You can have it. - Now if any of you are wondering why you're looking at this, choice crew, then listen carefully. These miserable individuals, are up here, because they have broken the rules of this school. They have broken, the laws of this state. And have brought shame upon themselves, their families. And most importantly, on all of you. Are you listening son? Go on, and get out! - Who, me? - Not you, the black next to you, green, get to my office. They have behaved foolishly and destructively, by bringing drugs into this school. And unfortunately, they are not the only ones. At this assembly, to have done so. - What are you (mumbles)? - And they're going to pay the penalty. They won't be sitting for their exams. They won't be getting a School Certificate. And they certainly won't be coming back for a second chance. These illustrious worms, are about to graduate onto the scrap heap of unemployment. Well, I think we've seen all we want to see of you three. You've got nothing to say for yourselves. And I've certainly got no intention of wasting any more words on you. Go on, get back to my office. Now, on the more pleasant matters. Tickets for the Sound of Music, will be on sale, for next Monday. immediately after this assembly. (Rain pouring) - Tough day for it, ay? You don't plan to go for a ride on that thing, are you? - Yeah, I just wanted to show it to someone. - It's not it that bothers me, its you I'm worried about. - Look I can handle it. - No plates, no licence. What do you think you're doing? I mean if they catch ya, you'll never ride again. - That's just it, I'm not gonna get caught ay. - Ay. (rain pouring) (motorbike reviving) (knocking on the window) - Hey Vick? Vick, come here. Come out I wanna show you something. - What? (keys tangling) - You got a bike. Do you wanna go out for speed? - Where do you think you are going? - Out, I'm just going out with Steve. - Hop on, will ya? - You expect me to get on this? - Shut up and get on will ya? - What's the matter, are you cold? - Yeah. (motorbike engine reviving.) (slow music) - My mother she reckons. She don't care what happens to me now. She reckons, I'm always in trouble cause I'm hanging around with you. - Me? - Should have told her you been hanging around that prefect, that's what went wrong. - (mumbles). - Well there is plenty more where he came from ay? - Hey! - Okay, okay, what's this? We've been hanging around each other for four years, then you come on all of a sudden. (upbeat music) - Come back here, and sit down. - Then just tell me who made these accusations? - All those boys who come inside. - No, I'm going to the Federation. - Now look Mrs-- - Mr.Yates, I'm going straight to the Federation. but there's not a great deal I can do. - Why? - We don't as I say, have any easy answers for a boy like Steven. Another reform school. - It's a very unpleasant decision to have to make, but there it is. I think we should bring him in and tell him. - Hey? - Please stay in the office. Steven, we'd like to talk with you. - Listen, hey, I told him everything I know. - And he still doesn't bloody do anything. Jesus Christ! Just who in the bloody hell do you think you are? You can't even speak the bloody language. - Come with me boy. - Yes sir. - Hey miss, what are you doing? - What's it look like? - What, they put you out already, did they? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Look I'm sorry Steve, I just can't talk about it now okay? - Will you come back or what? - I don't know. I'm in a lot of trouble here, it's hard to explain. What about you? How come you're still hanging around? I thought they had taken care of you already? - Ah, no, I'm leaving today. - Did you challenge it? - What do you mean? - Did you put up a fight? You can challenge it you know? You're entitled to sit for your exams. So, you just gonna let them wash you out the door, huh? - Oh, they're already taken care of that. - Well, if that's the way it feels, there's probably no point. Okay, good luck. Maybe I'll run into you sometime. - Yeah, okay. See you later. - Bye.
