Hey, April, what's wrong? My parents are making me go work at Camp Arrowhead for a month. That sucks. When do you leave? Tomorrow morning. Why don't you come with me? Why would I waste my summer working for all those rich brats? It won't be that bad with both of us there. - We can hunt for him. - No. Last time we investigated one of your Internet things, we wound up locked in a dumpster overnight. Yeah. Sorry. I'll see you later. Have fun. Call me if you change your mind. Will do. So I have something I have to tell you that you're not really going to like. Thanks for the warning. I have to start training for my new position. Regional headquarters are out of state. Why does that have to be out of the state? It's just where they send people. Now here comes the part you're really going to love. I made arrangements for you to stay with Aunt Carol and your cousins for the summer. Dad, my cousins are five years younger than me, and they still walk around picking their noses. It's the only option. What if there's another option? If there is another option, I'm open. There's a place I can go, but I'm not going to like it either. I don't know what I'm gonna do a whole month without seeing you. You'll survive, Mom. Remember, don't do anything stupid, okay? Okay, Mom. Give me a hug. Take care, sweetie. Uh... that's for the guests. We're over here. This is our dorm. Cool. Oh, April. Hi. - How are you, sweetheart? - Hi! - Mrs. Barnes... - Yes? ...this is Sophie Jordan. - Hi, how do you do? Welcome. - Hi. - It's nice meeting you. - Thank you. Well, this is a pretty special camp. There's work, but there's a fair amount of downtime, so there's fun too. - Right, April? - Mm-hm. And this is my grandson, Tyler. But you've already met him, haven't you, April? Yeah, I think it was two summers ago. How are you? - How does it look like I am? - I don't know. Well, why don't you get these things to your cabin, and we're going to get ready for lunch in about half an hour. - How does that sound? - Cool. Thank you. Thank you, servant. What? Thank you, servant. Did you hear what she just called me? I am not her servant. Just forget about her. Devon Dupris is a total jerk, and everyone knows it. She's a witch. And witches should always get what they deserve. Sophie... That's muy caliente hot sauce. Yep. Sophie. Let's go. Here you go. Specially made, just for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Enjoy. This is hot. This is really hot. Oh, my... It's burning. It's burning. I need water. Here, have some. Ha! Vengeance is so sweet. She is so going to rat on you. I don't care. This is great. Why is everyone out to get me? - Oh, my God, it is hot. - Yeah, I know! It's hot! Hot sauce, huh? Sophie, you can't be doing things like that with guests. But what if they're mistreating me? Well, then you come to me and I'll take care of it. And you messed with the wrong girl. Her mother is very influential in this community and at this camp. I know you've had a hard time, honey, but try not to take it out on the other kids, because I'd have to send you home, and I don't want to do that. I like you here. So let's consider this a first warning, okay? Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Barnes. So, what's the deal with Tyler? He was in a car accident about a year ago. He was driving with his grandfather, and his grandfather was killed. Mrs. Barnes' husband? Yeah. That sucks. He was studying law and on the track team when it happened. Now he just hangs out around here. And tries to chop wood? Where are you going? I'm going to help him. Can I help? No. Looks kind of hard to chop wood in a wheelchair. Well, it's not. Actually, I've been watching you, and you're not exactly Paul Bunyan. Can I try? Go ahead. Thanks. Come down right in the middle, all right? - Hard. - Okay. Ha! Yes! That wasn't so hard. Okay, round two. Whoo! Hey, where are you going? Looks like you got everything under control. I was just trying to help. Oh, look. Milkmaids. How quaint. Where are they going? To the archery range. Mrs. Barnes' husband was a champion archer, so there's a yearly run archery competition between our camp and the camp next door. Run archery? It's a combination of archery and running. Makes it a little more interesting. Is Mrs. Barnes okay? I heard she's out of money. This could be the last summer of Camp Arrowhead. Hey, hey, hey. I see you. My name is Percy. Sophie. So, what are you digging for? There's something buried around here, and I'm trying to find it. Good luck. You can get a shovel and help. No, I really have to get back to camp. Are you interested in archery? I can teach you. No, I really have to go. It was my pleasure meeting you. Yeah. You come back anytime. Don't hold your breath. I'm definitely going to be most valuable archer this year, guys. - Humble much? - That is her being humble. When you got it, you got to flaunt it. They act like they're God's gift to this world. Don't go obsessing all over them, Sophie. You're just wasting your energy. What else am I going to obsess on? It's my mom. She won't leave me alone. Maybe you should get a restraining order. That's not a bad idea. Why is she so hard on you? Well, every woman in my family was a champion archer, so I have to follow in their footsteps. The help looks bored. Let's put them to work. Oh, darn, Sophie, would you get my arrow for me? Perfect. Here you go, my queen. - Thank you, servant. - You're welcome. Have fun. Bye. Bye, guys. Weirdo. Sophie, what did you do? You're not going to like it. Oh, no. Who's that? Some weirdo I met in the woods. That doesn't sound good. I know. Hello. Sophie. Hello, Sophie. And who's this? I'm April. Nice to meet you, April. So, what are you doing here? Well, I thought I'd come see you about those archery lessons we talked about. I never said I wanted archery lessons. Well, the offer is still on the table. For free? Uh-huh. Okay. Sophie! And you too, January. It's April. Really? I thought it was summertime. Well, let's get started. Focus, and remember, every time your release hand got to be in the same spot, because all of this together will guarantee a successful shot. One and two and three and... But also, you want to know a little about your equipment. How was it made, what's its purpose. Your breathing is important. Your release is important. Your stance is important. - We both got it in the same spot. - Yeah. This is a great shot. You see it in your mind already there. Three, four... Focus. Good. Oh, that's good. Seems like a lot of work to not even know what you're digging for. I suppose. But I... I came here to find something. To help people. And I can't get over the feeling whatever it is I'm looking for, it's buried around here. What about you? What about me? Why are you so glum? Am I glum? If you really want to know... my mom died a few months ago. And we fought on the day of her accident. And I never got to apologize. I sent her a text, but she never got it. She knows how you feel. I don't think she does. Okay, let's get to digging. We are going to find what you are looking for. Why am I so off today? Your bow arm's elbow isn't rotating straight. That's why your arrow's veering off to the side. If I need help from the help, I'll you know. I can show you. Okay. Servant, show me. This'll be entertaining. Keep your bow arm elbow straight. That was luck. Was it? Bippity-boppity boo. You just got schooled, girl. She must be on performance-enhancing drugs. Obviously. Hi, Dad. I was just thinking about you. I hope you're doing well. I love you. Bye. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Actually, I'm not. I really miss my mom and dad. My mom died, and my dad hasn't been the same ever since. I don't know why any of this is happening to me. It's like I won a disaster lottery and I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I don't need to tell you about bad things happening. That sounded really bad. - I am so sorry. - No. It's okay. It doesn't make any sense. I looked away for two seconds. Everything that was ahead of me was just gone. Including my grandpa. I keep wondering if there's, like, a way that I can just set it all aside. Just, you know, move on with my life without feeling so bad and guilty all the time. I don't think there is. Why did you drop out of law school? Isn't it obvious? You don't need working legs to be an attorney. It's about more than working legs. What is it? I don't want everyone feeling sorry for me. You know, I don't need a courtroom feeling sorry for me. It could give you an edge over everyone else. If I have an edge, it's because I'm smarter, all right? And I work harder. And I'm good at what I do. Not because my legs don't work. Exactly. Hey, I think you'd make an amazing attorney. Have a good night. We've been practicing for how long, and we're going to lose next week because of you. I think we just had a bad day. You're not allowed to have a bad day. That is unacceptable. If you are not committed to winning, then quit right now. It is your choice. Stay, or get out! Let's finish. Yeah, I'm hungry. Hey. Hey. We want you to join the archery team. I don't think we can join the archery team. You can. We cleared it with Mrs. Barnes. Why do you want us to join the archery team? Because we suck, and two girls just quit. Or were scared off. Look, I know I haven't been that nice to you. You think? I'm sorry, okay? Now will you join? Okay. April and I will join the team. But first, you have to do something for us. What? - Get to work, girls. - You're kidding. Nope. Lunch is soon. Chop, chop, let's go! Oh, could you take this back and get me something without ham? I'm vegan. Sorry. Thank you. You're doing great. Oh, waiter, someone spilled some food over there. You might want to clean that up. - Okay. - Oh, and an iced tea would be nice too, sweetie. Ugh! He's late. He's definitely coming. Let's just be a little patient, okay? Here he comes. That's our new coach? That's him. Yeah, I don't think so. We're a package deal. Suck it up, Richie Rich. Hi. Everyone, this is Percy. This is Devon, Georgia, Samantha, April, Tyler and Mrs. Barnes. - How are you, Mrs. Barnes? - How do you do? Wonderful, wonderful. Percy. Do you have a last name, Percy? I'm afraid not, but "Percy" works for me. Well, Percy's a nice name, but I'm going to need some ID from you if you're going to work with my girls. I'm afraid I left it at home. So you don't have anything? I'm afraid not. Okay. Mrs. Barnes, do you think he could just, like, start training us today, and he can bring you his ID tomorrow? I suppose so. Thank you, Mrs. Barnes. Okay, girls. let's get started. - Whoo! - Yes! Let's go. Real good. That's my girls. Three. Perfect. You are shooting good. Don't let go yet. Count to three. Take it in. Shoot. One! Oh! Two, three. See the shot. Oh! All right! Good job, good job. Good job. Good job, ladies. - Hey, Percy. - Yes? You think you could be digging for a treasure? Yes, I suppose it could be. So it could be money? I suppose. If we help you find it, will we get a finder's fee? That's fair. - I'm in. - Me too. Percy, what are you doing? Yes, Mrs. Barnes. I noticed this screen was about to fall, and so I decided to fix it for you. Oh. Okay. And, Mrs. Barnes, there's quite a few things around here that need some fixing, especially the archery shed. I think I should put an alarm on that. Thank you, but I have a problem. I am required to get a background check on anybody who works on this property. Not just you. But I need some identification from you ASAP. ASAP? "As soon as possible." Oh! Okay. Okay, Mrs. Barnes. I'll have it for you tomorrow. I promise, I'll bring it tomorrow. I'll believe it when I see it. - Oh, no. - Who is that? My mother. Oh. Hello, darling. Mother. How are you? I brought you a new arm guard. I thought we agreed you weren't coming in until the final competition. No, I didn't agree to any of that. How could I? Honey, I'm your biggest fan. Who's this? Mom, this is our coach, Percy. Your coach? - Yes. - Oh. I don't remember seeing you ever on the circuit. Where have you coached before? I don't think I've ever coached before. Yeah, no. You see, my daughter, she's been training her entire life. And if she doesn't win this summer... I will be holding you personally responsible. Do you understand, Percy, it is? Yes. I'll be Googling you the first chance I get. Girls, get back to practice. And, honey, make sure you get a good night's sleep. I don't want to be disappointed. Well, that explains a lot. Shut up. She's not that bad. She is. I'm sorry, Percy. That's okay. But what is Googling? What you doing? Praying. Would you like to join me? No. God kind of ruined my life, so I'm never talking to him again. You can tell him that. Are you sure? Yes. Tell him those exact words. His feelings was hurt. So he can dish it out but he can't take it? He respects how you feel. But it was never his intentions to dish it out. So while you're talking to God, Percy, you think you could see if he could get my message to my mom? That's not how it works, Sophie. You can't blame me for trying. You can't keep beating yourself up the rest of your life over your mom. Believe me, I can. What is it like? Talking to your mom? What do you mean? When you imagined speaking to her now. I'm in a forest... and I come to a clearing. And there's a bench. The light is beautiful... and very still. And I talk to my mom. And I tell her everything that I wanted to tell her. How much I miss her. And how much she means to me. And she listens. And it's peaceful and warm. And after I'm done talking to her, she lets me know that she loves me. And that's it. Your mom already knows that. It's nice to think like that, but that's all it is. Just a way to feel better. Good night, Percy. Good night. Father, bless that family. Give her strength. Encourage her heart. Give her peace. And I ask it in your son's name. Hey. So this is how the rich folks live. Hardly. The sheets are like sandpaper. Oh, poor babies. Do you play? A little. You can borrow it if you want. There's a talent show. They're always looking for suckers. That's poison oak on your hand? How do you know? Because I sort of gave it to you. You gave it to me? How...? You told me to get your arrow. I went and got it. I rubbed it in poison oak and I handed it back to you. We were fighting. I shouldn't have, - and I really apologize... - Are you kidding me? Here, take this. It'll, like, take down the itching. I don't want your lotion. - Get out. - Just take it. Get out. Thank you for having me. Good night. I'm sorry. Are you... Like, seriously? That's rude. The Straight Arrows are so desperate, they brought in the hired help. I smell desperation. Or maybe that's just B.O. Ladies. Okay, as the team captain, let's make sure I cross the finish line first. It'll look good. I'm here to win, for the team. So I'm not going to throw this just for you to cross first. Fine. It was a stupid idea. Yes, it was. Shake? That's your infected hand. Mm-hm. It's actually a lot better. All right, ladies, it's time. Let's get to your marks. Come on, Devon. Don't let me down. - On your mark. - Come on, team. You can do this. Come on, girls, you know you can do it. Come on, Sophie. You can do it. Come on, Sophie. Way to go, Sophie. Great shot. What are you doing? Let's go get a bull's-eye. Come on. - What happened? - She cheated. Cheated? You're unbelievable. Thank you. - Try and beat that. - Watch me. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my duty to inform you that the Straight Arrows have been disqualified for breaking the competition rules. So this round goes to the Shiver Quivers. You call yourself a coach? Oh, no, you are just some demented old man who should be locked up in a home somewhere. Yes, I am going to investigate you. Devon! - Mom, let me go. - I'm not going to let you go. How do you think this makes me look? Stop. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, cheater. You saw my mom, Sophie. She's cutthroat and ruthless, and the pressure she puts on me to win is... is practically unbearable. Look, I know that I messed up today, but I'm not a bad person. You keep saying that. I'm not. I just... I lost out in the mom department, and I wish you would try and understand how messed up that makes my whole life. Have you tried to understand my life? I lost my mom. I will never see her again. I will never hug her. I will never confide in her. I will never smell her apple pie. Nothing. So don't get all sobby with me about your mom. At least you have one. Yeah, well, maybe you're lucky. I'd rather have no mother than a monster. Stop it! Wait! Wait! Get away! What are you two doing? Dinner's served.

Hi, I'm Sam. April, something's wrong. What? That's the fire alarm. Come on. Whoa. Use a hose. Ah! All of our stuff. - What are we going to do? - Let's keep moving. Come on, guys. I got it, I got it. Right there. Mrs. Barnes, what happened? That alarm you installed caught fire and burned up the shed. The bows and the arrows, some of them had been in my family for 40 years. I'm sorry this happened. But can I help? I think you've done enough, Percy. - Please, let me help. - Go. - Are you okay? - You know, sometimes it just seems like everything I touch goes wrong. You were just trying to help. But maybe I should stop trying to help. Just go home. We'll come by later, okay? Okay. What happened? Percy, right? He did this. Well, it appears so. I told you he's dangerous. I'm going to do something about him, okay? Why don't you just let it be for now. He didn't mean to. I don't care if you try or don't try. I am not going to be held victim to his incompetence, and neither should you. I'm going to take care of it. I'm sorry. All right, well, he's not at his cabin, so where else would he be? He doesn't have anywhere else to go. - He doesn't know anyone. - I guess just keep driving. Get off the road. Stop. There he is. Yeah, but what is he doing? Well, howdy! What are you doing? I'm here helping my friends paint their new house. This is Valerie, Victor and Sheila. - Hi, hi. - Hi. You guys are just in time to help us. Can you give us a hand? - Why not? - All right! Let's go. - There you go. - Thanks. So how'd you guys meet Percy? We met on the train. Oh, that's cool. - Not like you think. - Oh? Mm-mm. The three of us were bumming a ride on the Continental Express train. We jump on a boxcar, we're going along, and there's Percy. Oh, yeah. He'd been on that train for about three days straight. He was frozen stiff. Really? We figured he probably covered a thousand miles. - Wow. - Something like it. Percy told us that he was looking for a specific town and a cabin in the woods. Yeah, I recognize the town he was talking about. So we helped him find the cabin. And then he... ...he made us dig and dig and dig for a buried treasure. We dug forever. It felt like a hundred holes. It felt like a thousand. Yeah, we've dug a few of those holes too. Yeah, but you all volunteered. You're right. Percy always delivers on what he says. Like this house. Percy got you this house? Well, I don't know how he got it... but it's ours. Homeless no more. Thank you, Percy. Thank you. You're welcome. You guys, you're all my friends. Thank you. Yeah. - There you go. - Thanks. Nice and slow. You're good. Thank you, thank you. You don't mind if I sit out here for a while? Of course. How do you feel? I'm okay. But I really appreciate you kids. We appreciate you too, Percy. You know, I kind of wish that I was a much better angel. Percy, you're the perfect angel. Our angel. Thank you. Well, it's not as glamorous as it seemed. Okay, well, have a good night. We'll see you in the morning for practice. - Will do. - Bye! Thank you, girls. Thank you. Be careful. We will. - I got you. - I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay, good night, you two. Good night. Thank you for driving. Yeah, well, I'm good for something. You don't have to keep putting yourself down like that. I think you're pretty amazing. I think you're pretty amazing too. Well, then, we have a mutual admiration club. - Just two members? - Yeah. Okay. I'm in. I'll see you in the morning. You will. Good night. Night. - What's that? - I don't know. - What's going on? - I don't know. Well, thank you again, Mrs. Barnes. Thank you, officer. I-I-I don't think he's dangerous. He has been squatting on camp property, fraternizing with our girls. Most certainly he is dangerous. We'll check into him. Keep everyone at the camp for now, and we'll let you know when it's safe. Thank you so much, officers. Thank you. What did you do? Oh, I saved you. That man, Percy, he is an escaped mental patient. That's not true. I'm sorry, Sophie. I'm afraid it's partially true. Let's let the officers do their jobs. I still think that there's something strange going on. How could you? He was our friend. Devon. Devon Dupris, get back here right now. No. I can cut you out of your trust fund faster than you know. Go for it. I don't really care anymore. - Where are we going? - We're going to warn Percy. We can go out through the meadow. - Right there? - Yeah, through the trees. Okay, come on, guys. - Percy! - Percy! Percy, they're coming for you. - Who's coming for me? - The police. They said you escaped from this home and that you're really dangerous. Come on. Did you escape from somewhere, Percy? Well, my mind is a... It's not that good, but when I think about it, I may have. Percy, you need to come with us. We can help you get away. There's no reason for me to run. Percy, we don't want the police to catch you. Well, I think it's a little too late. Whatever happens, remember this: there's a rhyme and a reason for everything. Y'all must remember that. Sir, I need you to step away from the girls. We're fine. He's not dangerous. Step away right now. - It's okay. - Come over here, sir. Everything will be okay. It's going to be all right. - I got him, partner. - It's really gonna be all right. Handcuffs? Seriously? We're just following procedure. It's unnecessary. Okay, sir. Watch your head stepping in, please. This is so unfair. The treasure! You guys... Okay. - Yeah, baby! - Oh, my God. How much do you think he'll let us keep? - Look. - It's Mrs. Barnes. Yeah. That is really weird. Yeah, he just met Mrs. Barnes. He had to have gotten this picture, put it in the case and then buried it. He's not that crazy. Is he? Maybe Mrs. Barnes buried it. Why would she do that? Okay, let's put this money back. Give it back. Putting it away. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's go. All right, next case. The State v. Percy regarding his mental fitness to live independently. All right! Hi, girls. Tyler! How are you guys doing? You got this. Wow, what a blessing. Let's come to order. Okay, Dr. Krall. You may proceed and present state's case. Now, Percy, just to give the court a little background, a little over a year ago you were found dazed and confused along a road in New Mexico. You evidently had hit your head, causing severe disorientation and confusion. The local authorities, finding no next of kin, committed you to the Barlow Mental Hospital. But three months ago, you escaped from that hospital and traveled to our community. Why did you leave that hospital, sir? The food was terrible. They didn't even serve any ice cream or milk with the chocolate cake. And where I came from, that's illegal. I complained. We are not concerned with ice cream being served with chocolate cake. Now, Percy, do you mind telling the court who you are? I don't understand. Well, when I examined you, you insisted that you be called something. He's not going to say what I think he's going to say, right? Wait for it. Do you recall what that is? I'm an angel. You are an angel. Yes, sir. Can you fly? No. Can you disappear? No. But I'm a trainee. And those powers come later. Mm. No doubt when you get your wings. Exactly, exactly. Never mind that. So, Percy, you cannot fly, you can't disappear. What can you do? I can be kind. You can be kind. That's it? Yes. It's hardly nothing. But you have to agree that if everyone was kind, this world would be a better place. That is not the question that we are trying to determine, sir. Your Honor, we are here to determine if Percy is mentally competent enough to be alone in this big, unkind world. And, more importantly, if he poses a danger to the kids of Camp Arrowhead, especially considering he burned down their equipment shed just a few days ago. I say he is a danger, and he should be confined to an appropriate, secure facility. No further questions, Your Honor. Well, thank you, Dr. Krall. Based on your... Permission to cross-examine. - And who are you? - I'm Tyler Barnes, sir. What are your qualifications to cross-examine, Mr. Barnes? I was a... I am a pre-law student, Your Honor. You can step forward. Hi, Tyler. Percy, you pose no harm to any living thing, do you? Absolutely not. I love everything and everyone. And what do you believe is your purpose on Earth? Well... my purpose is to help people. I know that's a big job. But there's so many people that need help. And I believe in people. I believe in them very much. And why is that? Well, people are inherently kind, and they have the spirit that searches for that which is right. When you get caught up in the little things, you judge each other in your appearance, your money and how many followers you have. All the things that don't matter. You see, underneath all of their insecurities... people just want to know that they are loved. I believe my purpose is to let them know they're absolutely not alone... and that they are practically perfect just the way they are. Why practically perfect, Percy? Only God is truly perfect. And he understand our imperfections. And he love us anyway. Because his love for us is so great, he'll never abandon us or forsake us. He'll be with us until the end. Thank you, Percy. My pleasure, Tyler. No further questions, Your Honor. Percy... I don't know if you're an angel or not, but I can tell that you are a very wise and kind man. And in these uncertain times, we need all the kind people we can get. So I'm going to allow you to live on your own and to continue to spread your kindness. And that includes working with those kids at Camp Arrowhead. Providing... Providing that you check in every week with a court-appointed welfare worker. Thank you. And that you call an electrician whenever doing anything electrical in the future. I agree! Now that's a good idea. It's not fair. It's just not fair. I did exactly what you asked me to do. You taught me to love people. You did. You taught me. And now you want to change it. And I come here and I do that, and now you upset. I don't understand. I really don't understand. Percy! Oh, my gosh, are you okay? Oh, I'm okay. - I'm okay. - Oh, my God. He's ice-cold. Call an ambulance, okay? I'm telling you, I'm just a little dizzy. You are not okay. What's his pulse? 40 BPM. Blood pressure? 90 over 50. Better take it again. Whoa, I'm fine. No, I'm fine, doc. I'm fine. Your heart rate is 40. You're not fine. There's a reason for that. Oh, really? What's that? I'm an angel. And angels have slow heartbeat. I'm surprised you didn't even know that, doc. I must have missed that in med school. Breathe in. You guys, what if Percy really is an angel? He wouldn't be in the hospital if he was an angel. Would he? when they want to blend in and do good deeds for people. One of the ways to spot an angel is, how do you feel when you're in their company? I feel strangely at peace when I'm around that dude. Me too. Same. I've never seen an 80-year-old with a 40 heart rate. He should be dead. Maybe we should get Mrs. Barnes over here. I'll call Sam and have him bring her over. Okay. What are you doing here? I came to see Percy, as stupid as that sounds. He's in there. I'm glad you're here. Why am I here? Hm? You know, all of that guilt and shame and unforgiveness that you've been carrying around, it's time to let it go. I know your past. I know what you've been through. I know how hard it's been. And your daughter... ...you love her. She love you. God forgive you for everything you've done. You are forgiven. Tyler, he asked to see you. Me? Hello, Tyler. Hey, Percy. I was really impressed with your performance today. I think you should continue to pursue law. You do? I'm pretty connected in my own way. I've arranged for you to have a full scholarship at Columbia Law School, beginning this fall. - Really? - If you like. Yeah, of course. And while you're there, they'll be doing some amazing work at Clarity Research Center with paralysis victims. There are going to be some significant breakthroughs, and I've arranged for you to be a part of that study. I'd like that very much. Great. You'll do well. Hey. Come on in. How are you feeling? I never felt better. But I have some news. What kind of news? Well, I'm going to be reassigned. Reassigned? Yes. It look like my work here is almost done. I can't thank you girls enough for believing in me and helping me. Each of you is strong and smart, and you're going to do wonderful things in your life. You're going to discover everything does indeed happen for a reason. Thank you, Percy. Girls, we have to get Percy ready for surgery. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to have surgery. Percy, if we don't get in there and take a look, you may die. Doc, angels can't die. But I am going to be reassigned in a few minutes. - Reassigned? - Yes. So there's nothing you need to do. Percy, we found what you were trying to dig up. You did? Whoa. Lots of money. And also, there was this picture. Wow. What a beauty. Do you recognize her? Mrs. Barnes. Where is she? She's on her way. Over here, Mrs. Barnes. This is for all of you. I promised you a cut. Are you sure? You earned it. I promised it to you. We can't take this, Percy. Especially if it belongs to Mrs. Barnes. Hello, Percy. Hi, Mrs. Barnes. How are you doing? Well, I was a little fuzzy-headed. But now everything is crystal clear. I was sent here to get you that money that your husband buried. He just felt terrible that you didn't have it. How do you know he felt terrible? Because I was with him in heaven. He asked me to tell you that if he had a flower for every time he thought of you, he could walk in his garden forever. Mr. Barnes waits for you in a very lovely garden. Dear man. This money belongs to you. Use it to pay off the debts of the camp. I'm not very good at goodbyes. So let's just say good night. - Good night, Percy. - Good night. Good night. And thank you for everything. Percy? Where did he go? He's gone. Good morning, Sophie. I drew this map for you. Will you follow it? There are no accidents. The trees, the sun, the birds in the sky, it's all by design. Life is just one part of our journey. We're born, we live and we die. But death is not the ending. It is a transition to eternal life, where we all will be together in heaven. Sophie, you asked me once if I could help you communicate with your mother. Well, I had to pull a few strings. Take care, my friend. One day, we'll be together again on the other side. I don't know if I could ever tell you how much I love you. How much I miss you... and how sorry I am that we fought the day of your accident. I sent you a text, but I don't know if you got it. "Hi, Mom. "I'm sorry for how I acted. "You're an awesome mom. "I couldn't ask for any other mom in the whole world. "I'm working on my temper. "Sometimes, things just come out "that they don't even sound like me. "I know you just want the best for me. "And I love you so much. Sophie." And here's the last one. Well, here we go. Dad? Dad! Oh, my gosh. What are you doing here? Well, it's the strangest thing. The man from the sporting goods store called, said bring the boxes up to camp. I had the weekend off, so here I am. - Oh, my God. - It's archery equipment. - Oh, yeah. - Enough for 10 girls. Oh, I can't believe it. You guys, the final competition is in two hours. I think the Shiver Quivers are going down. - Absolutely. - Yes. - Count me in. - Okay, me too. - I want some of that. - One, two, three. Arrowheads! - How's it going? - Good. These are so nice. I know, right? Wow. So, you know, Percy arranged for me to go to Columbia Law School. That's amazing. It's in New York. Hello? There's this thing called the Internet. Oh, yeah, I think I've heard of that. I think our mutual admiration club can handle any distance. Don't you? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Can I help you out? Yeah. Get to work. Thank you. All right, you guys heard the official. We're going to keep it clean. Don't want to be docked. Hey. That man Percy, he... He knew everything about me. And he told me that God forgives me for every terrible thing that I've done. And that includes being mean to you. Can you forgive me? Well, if God did, then I guess I can. Honey, I really love you. You want to cross the finish line first? Let's cross together. Sounds good. Okay, girls. On your mark. Get set.
