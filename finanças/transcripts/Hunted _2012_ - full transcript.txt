(English accent): Why here? Because I can't go any further. Promise me you'll try to fit in. I'll try. What if they find me? They're all dead and buried. Nobody remembers who you are, Rufus. [TRUCK HORN HONKS] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] The trucker said she stepped right into him. The boy say anything? Not a word, Hugh. He's a strange one. You might want to stand up wind. He don't smell so good. Looks like you've had a pretty hard day, huh? What's your name son? Rufus. You got a last name, Rufus? Was she your grandmother? A stranger? So you knew her then? Where are you from? Nowhere. Where were you going? I think we were coming here. You think? How old are you? Old enough. Look, why don't we try this all again later... when you're feeling a little better, huh? What do you say we get you in the car and warm up, right? Okay? Come on. It's okay. Would you mind cracking your window? ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( SNIFFING ) Please. ( WINDOW ROLLS DOWN ) [JENNIFER] He's filthy, Hugh. It's only for one night, Jen. Who is he? I don't know. Please. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [HUGH] Hey, kid? You've been in there almost an hour. Are you okay? HUGH (echoing): Kid? Get your clothes off. Clean yourself up. ( DOOR CLOSES ) Joe's downstairs in the cooler, Hugh. [JOE] Well, I'm surprised she's even in one piece. I sent her fingerprints over to Chet. I mean what do you want me to do? I'm a vet not a coroner, Hugh. You know if you could keep her on ice for a few more days, I'd appreciate it, Joe. I need some time to get the story from the boy. You know, sort this thing out. Did you find anything in her clothes? Nothing. Not even lint. But there is a small scar on her left temple and matching one on her right. Puncture marks of some sort. Here, see? Now I'll bet if you opened her skull you'll find her frontal lobe has been severed. Lobotomy? It's just a hunch. How old would you say she is? 75, 80? Maybe a bit older. If the health department discovers she's down here, I lose my license. Thanks Joe. Don't worry. You plan on stayin' up there all day? You're a long way up. It must be quite a view. They say your grandma killed herself. Is that so? My mom's in Las Vegas. There's a second mortgage on our house. We'll lose it if she's not careful. Is it true Hugh and Jennifer sleep in separate rooms? Mine don't even live in the same town. They won't even talk unless it's an argument. You don't say much. Do you? You haven't given me a chance. Did you push her? Who told you that? No one. I just thought you might've. I've considered poisoning my mother once or twice. I like your accent. I like yours. You want to play a game? Stay behind that line. Take off your clothes. Go on! Your turn. Let me see the rest of you. I haven't got all day. What now? That depends. I think most boys would have crossed that line about now. You said not to. The game's not that much fun if you follow the rules, Rufus. You're cold. I can't feel your heart. It's on the other side. Don't worry, Rufus. Most boys don't even have one. You are something different. ( DOORBELL RINGS ) [KNOCK ON DOOR] Nice, very nice. Check in... excellent. Service... unsatisfactory. Bathroom? No... no, no, no. ( KNOCKING ) Knock, Knock. I hope you don't mind. I found it in the closet. They built these near our house in Seattle. 16 bombers a day. They'd fly them so low, I could almost touch them. When was this? During the war. Which war? World War II was over 70 years ago, Rufus. It doesn't seem so long. Try these on. See if they fit. I spent the day sifting through missing person's reports with Chet. We called the British Embassy, Interpol. Man, you can't believe how many young people go missing every year. You think he's one of them? Well, he's definitely not from around these parts. That's for damn sure. He said he lived in Seattle. He told you he lived in Seattle? And a thousand other places, if you can believe what he says. Did he tell you his last name? No, but he has a heart condition. "Situs inversus" I looked it up. It's quite rare. His heart and his other organs are all turned around. And, I took his temperature twice. It's 68 degrees. It's warmer in the house. Is it fatal? No, but it makes him different and I can tell he doesn't like it. Where is he right now anyway? With Tracy McKay. You let him go out with Tracy McKay? Hugh, he likes her. What was I supposed to do? It is nice having a boy around the house again. Hot or cold. He's not ours, Hugh. What are you doing here, Rufus? No one comes to Conrad? I've seen worse. I find that hard to believe. If a genie popped out of a lamp and gave you just one wish, what would it be? Just one? Don't get greedy, Rufus. Well? I can't tell you. It won't come true. You can trust me. I can keep a secret. You really hate it here. Don't you? ( VEHICLE APPROACHES ) Let's go. Hey! We need to talk. I know what you want and it sure ain't conversation. I sure hope you're baby sitting. He doesn't look old enough to be out after 10:00. Look, there's a bush party in Paterson on the weekend. Maybe I'll take you if you're nice to me. Not interested. Don't walk away from me! Ow. Stop it! Rufus! Stop it! Stop it, Rufus. [TRACY] Are you crazy? Sorry. He's gonna kill you. It's a little late for sorry. Oh, my god! [TRACY] Rufus, wake up. You'll live. ( TRACY SCREAMS ) [TRACY] Clay, he's hurt! ( TRACY SCREAMS ) Don't. Stop. Stop. Stop it! ( TRACY SCREAMS ) What the hell was that for, huh? ( DOOR OPENS ) ( LOUD GROWL ) ( CLAY YELLS ) Ahh! [TRACY] Oh, my god. [TRACY] Rufus! ( ROARS ) Stop it! Get off of him! ( YELLING ) Ahh! What the hell? Clay, you better get your ass home. ( TRUCK ENGINE STARTS ) Rufus? [VAN DUSEN] Begin... capital letters... bold print... quote. Our success rides on the outcome over the next several days. This opportunity will not come again, ever, in our lifetime. Standard second paragraph. Add the latest cost report and distribute amongst the department heads. P.S... it is very barren out here... end. You didn't have to walk me home. I live across the street. Yeah. I wish I wasn't me. What would you wish for? I'd wish for you. I had a nose bleed. It happens sometimes. Jenny waited up half the night for you. We figured you'd run off. Rufus you're a guest in this house okay. I expect you home at a decent hour. Understand? Good. I'd like to think I can trust you. These are very old. I've been through them a hundred times. They're for looking. You can't even take them out. I brought change for the photocopier. Smile. Go on. It's not gonna kill you. I don't see any fangs. But you had them, claws too. There was a nasty bump there. I didn't mean to hit you so hard. The problem is, you don't fit the vampire rule book. You have a reflection, you don't burst into flames in daylight. You should consider yourself lucky. Yeah, I'm really lucky. That would hurt. It's the only way to kill someone like you. Look, I'm not a vampire. There's no such thing. They're just stories in books. Fairy tales. You should know better. I know what I saw. He tried to hurt you. What are we going to do with you, Rufus? [HUGH] '56. [RUFUS] New York Yankees. '57. Milwaukee Braves. '87. Minnesota Twins. Winning manager. Tom Kelly? Maybe. All right kid, let's see what you got. No mercy. You sure? Yeah, come on. Drill it home. Jesus kid, where'd you learn to throw like that? Jen? Did you get a load of his arm? Who said that you could use this? [HUGH] Hey! What are you doing? There was a reason this was put away. Nobody touches it. [HUGH] Oh come on Jen, he's wearing his clothes, he's sleeping in his bed. What the hell's the difference? ( DOOR SLAMS ) 1904? They didn't play that year. If you say so, kid. [HUGH] What happened, happened. I can't change the past. [JENNIFER] Hugh, please don't. How long are you going to punish me, huh? Just give the kid the god-damn glove. It's not the Holy Grail. Look, for the first time in years I really thought we had a chance. Don't, don't take that away from me. Please. I want you back. Hey uh, let's play some ball. Come on. ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( DOG BARKING ) ( DOG WHINES ) Shhhh. It's real nice here. I made a friend. I've been trying real hard, like I promised. It's not so easy. Did you cry? Should I have? I don't know, Rufus. It all depends what she means to you. She's cold like you. I'm not so cold. Not really. Here you go. I'm not hungry. You haven't had as much as a cookie crumb since you got here. You're a growing boy. If you don't eat something you're going to get sick. What is it? [JENNIFER] Chick peas and wild rice. What's this thing? [JENNIFER] It's a tofu patty. The girl at the store said that it tasted like hamburger. I don't remember the kid saying he was a vegetarian. I thought Rufus might like it. I'm the one who's going to starve to death around here. It looks good. Well things must look a little better on your side of the table than mine. Why don't you just scrape the food off your plate into the garbage, Hugh, and save yourself the experience of trying something new. ( VOMITING ) [TRACY] Why did you eat it if you knew it would make you so sick? She made it special. It's okay, just let it out. Okay, breathe. ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) It's okay. You're gonna be- ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) I'm fine, Mom. How's Vegas? No. I said everything's fine. What could possibly be going on around here? I'm sitting on the toilet. Can I talk to you later? Yeah, yeah, I love you too, bye. What are you doing? I think someone's in the backyard. It's Rufus. He's sleeping in his snow fort. He's what? It's a snow house, Hugh. Tracy helped him. Where'd he get a stupid idea like that? Tracy. You told me he has a bad heart. He'll get pneumonia out there. It's lined with the tarp from your motor boat and he has your sleeping bag. You yourself said it was the best money could buy. Why didn't somebody run this by me? He won't be out there long. Trust me. He's snuck inside twice already. She might be out there with him. There's barely enough room for one. All zipped up in there real tight. Christ, you might as well give him the keys to the car. They could have got a motel room. If you could only hear yourself. She had an abortion. You know that right? It's a rumor. Well, she sure as hell wasn't on vacation. ( DOORBELL RINGS ) Oh, well, that's probably a surprise visit from child services right now. Don't worry, I'll let them know the kid's outside sleeping in a snow bank. Rufus lives here, right? It's 11:00 o'clock at night, Clay. Is he sleeping? We're all sleeping. What do you want? It can wait. I'll come back another time. Hey! What happened here? Just horsin' around, you know. It's nothing. Be careful. I'll try. Is that Clay Huxley? Listen, the next time Rufus wants to camp out, tell him he can make a fort with the dining room chairs, huh. You're pretty quiet today. What did he want? You'd know more than me. Clay is almost a man, Rufus. You're still a boy. Be careful around him, and Tracy too. Don't do anything you know is wrong. I owe Hugh a couple of steaks after that wild rice fiasco. Yeah, I think he still loves you. You can't keep a secret in this town. Not for long. You can't be different. Hold still. Are there others like you? I hope not. An old boy scout trick. Here, keep this on for a week. Real magic... scares people. We're having steak for dinner. Do you wanna come over? Jenny's still shopping. We could pick you up another. Look, I'm a senior. I can't be seen with a boy like you. I mean my friends wouldn't understand. Friends are important. What did you want last night? Another look. ( TOOLS CLANKING ) You wanna take a picture? Help me up. Thanks. Hey look uh, if it's a ride you want I can't, even if I wanted to. Company policy. But, you know I could use some help. There's a socket set up in the cab behind the passenger seat, if you want? I'd sure appreciate it. All right. Thanks. Ah, it's in a red case. ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR SLAMS SHUT ) Getting a little colder, huh? You know I'm glad you came by. Why don't you relax. You know uh, why don't you warm up for now. Let's warm up. Come on. ( RUFUS GROWLING ) ( TRUCKER SCREAMS ) Sorry. ( HONKS HORN ) I'm here. CHET (On radio): We've got a fingerprint match on that gal in Joe's cooler. Did we hear anything about the boy? No. Nothin' yet, Hugh. Sorry, I'm workin' on it. I'll let you know. Look Chet, I'm over here at the truck stop. Grab a set of bolt cutters and get your ass over here immediately, alright. And by the way, do we have any of that yellow police tape left over? It's in the glove box, Hugh. Why, what's going on? Just get your butt over here. You'll see. What's back there? Hamburger patties. There's an awful lot of blood in that cab. Yeah. I'll ask around, see if anyone saw anything. Good. What do you think happened? I prefer my food cooked, personally. There's a lot of talk about what happened at the truck stop. [HUGH] Yeah, it's a nasty bit of business. That's for sure. You need a body to prove a murder. Well thank you for your expert opinion, Clarence Darrow. But I'd prefer not to talk about it at the dinner table. I thought you were a vegetarian anyway? [JENNIFER] I bumped into Vera Stern over at the school board. She wants to know what our plans are for Rufus. Tell Vera Stern to mind her own business, huh. Besides, Rufus is just passing through. Isn't that right, Rufus? If you want to talk to me I'm all ears. Yeah, that's what I thought. You've got blood on your chin. Why did you have to pick such a big one? He's not that big. Besides, I didn't pick him. He picked me. We'll put him out across the highway. You've got to promise me you'll never do this again. He wasn't a nice man, Tracy. He would have buried me just as fast. Promise me. Alright fine. I promise. Say it like you mean it. I promise, all right? Now just help. [HUGH] Sit down. Now how was it the world's oldest living woman was your traveling companion? [JENNIFER] Hugh, please don't! [HUGH] Jen, I know what I'm doing. It's my job. If you don't like it you can sit in the living room. Read it, kid. Some pretty interesting tidbits in there. Go on. I don't know how. What? You don't know how to read. Jesus Christ, kid! How many secrets do you have? "The patient has been diagnosed as paranoid delusional. "She represents a severe danger to herself "and other patients of this institution. Attempts to modify her behavior have proven unsuccessful." Well, it's no wonder she stepped in front of a truck. They drilled holes in her head. She was crazy. That's a lie! Listen! Vacation's over all right! Who are you?! I don't know. Everybody knows who they are. What's your last name, kid? [JENNIFER] Rufus, what are you afraid of? She helped me escape. She told me to fit in but, I don't know how! Escape from where? The people who hurt me. What people? What did they do to you? Listen, sit down! [JENNIFER] We want to help you! Don't you get it?! You can't! No one can! Kid! Don't. Don't give up on him. Not yet. ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) Where you going, kid? That way. 70 miles of nothing between here and the next town. Where you from? Conrad. Thought so. Come on. Get in. Come on. You're not from around here. Are you? Nope. Just visiting. Who are you visiting? Are you coming or are you going? You know my dad's the chief of police. Oh, that's very honorable. Should I be worried? Just a fact. Where do you live? Can I stay here tonight? They're worried sick about you. Please? I can take a hot bath if you think I'm too cold. Are you okay? Take off your underwear. Like this. ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( CLEARING THROAT LOUDER ) Good morning. Morning. I'm Tracy's mother. Tracy, Tracy? Hi. [VICKIE] You and I need to have a little talk! [JENNIFER] Vickie. I believe this belongs to you. Now my daughter is vulnerable. You know that Jennifer. The next time I find this boy in her bed, I will chop it off. You've been warned. You got that stud? - You just can't just-- - Why not? Because there are consequences to your actions. Tracy feels the need to be loved. She'll do whatever it takes to find that love. And then she gets hurt. And it takes her a very long time to feel good about herself again. I want to be loved. We all do, Rufus. 107 years old. She doesn't look a day over 90. You're not kin, Mr. Van Dusen. So why are you here? Our legal department has prepared all the documents. I'm sure you're gonna find them in order. We only confirmed her identity yesterday. Your legal department must have been working overtime. Bristol Anderson does have over 17,000 employees world wide. You're a two-man operation with a chipped Black and Decker coffee pot. She was traveling with a companion, yes, a boy? I think we're done here. I'll have my deputy draw up the death certificate. I'm sure you're anxious to be on your way. Okay, thank you. Thank you. [JENNIFER] Hugh kept- his service revolver locked in a case in his closet. And Adam knew that he wasn't supposed to touch it. He had some friends over and I was in the backyard. And I heard the shot. He bled to death before we could even get him to the hospital. Hugh blamed himself. I was angry... and I let him. All these years. Who's fault was it? No one's. It's just the worst kind of bad luck. We meet again. I hear an old gal was hit by a truck- most unfortunate. I wouldn't know. What do you know? You never said who you were visiting? No I didn't. Did I? I'd wager there's a lot of secrets in a tiny town like this, huh? Is that what you do, collect secrets? I've got a warehouse full of secrets. Do you know mine? I know you're not the Sheriff's son. Enjoy your stay. See you around. ( CHUCKLES ) Come on. Come on. What does it say? "Welcome to Conrad. We support our troops." What if you don't? I suspect the Chamber of Commerce and local legion would probably burn your house down. Thoughts like that are best kept to yourself. You've been warned. Wars are stupid. If you bit my neck, would I live forever? Don't be silly. Of course, not. Try, right here. I don't want to. Just for fun. I said no! Then why do you do it? I don't know. Why do birds fly? Because they have wings, Rufus. Don't. In 1934, she escaped with 12 other wards of the State. They were all apprehended except Kettle and a juvenile. Juvenile, huh? There's a schedule of her weekly electroshock therapy. Looks like they pumped enough voltage through her to light up a football stadium. [HUGH] Van Dusen, here it is. He's 48 years old, holds degrees in mythology and archeology. He's been with Bristol Anderson 23 years, research and development. Founding directors are Thomas Bristol, Patrick Anderson, and they are both deceased. Bristol was born in England. Richard Nixon attended his funeral in '72, a president. Wait a minute. Yeah, they were both on staff at Scranton back in '32. Chief of psychiatry Thomas Bristol, Chief Surgeon Patrick Anderson. That's interesting. But what does it mean? I don't know. ( PHONE RINGS ) Conrad Police Department. You don't say. Can you hold on a sec? Nevada D.O.C. Seems our missing trucker has a history. Sheriff Wade. What do you got? No one bothers them. They just stand there looking out. I envy them sometimes. How long has it been closed? I don't know. A long time. I don't remember it ever being open. Do you remember Jenny's son Adam? I know he died. It was a long time ago. Why didn't you tell me you dated Clay? Who told you that? Jenny. She doesn't lie. Yeah and so what? You bit him and sucked his blood and puked it up in my tub. That makes us even. I thought I was saving your life. Guess not. How many other boys? I screwed half the town. Is that what you want to hear? I've been called a lot worse than what you're thinking right now, Rufus. Of all people- you judging me. Yeah, well I haven't slept with half the town. No, but given the chance you'd probably eat them. You might not even be here next week. Where does that leave me? Don't confuse sex with love, Rufus. You can't even spell it. I thought I was your wish. Wake up! Wishes don't come true. I wish you hadn't slept with Clay. Can I let go? Um, not yet. It's not dry. You know if we could find some tape, I wouldn't need your help at all. Oh, I don't mind. You should call her. And say what? I did nothing. Are you sure about that? Well, I should know if I did something. She's the one that slept with half the town. Ahh. Are you okay? Where's your little cutie pie tonight? I'm over him. That was fast. Were you in love with Dad? That's a silly question. Of course, I was. Then why did you leave him? I don't know. I suppose the things I loved most about him I started to hate. It usually works that way. I probably should have fallen for somebody boring. But they're no fun. Are they? I don't need some boy falling in love with me. Sweetie, there's tape on that for a reason. Dad doesn't call anymore. ( MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) [CLAY] Hey! Come on. Rufus. I work here on the weekends. Pretty cool, right? I don't suppose you saw the 1956 World Series. New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Yankees won the series in seven games. Four-three. I wasn't alive then, Rufus. My mom's never happy. Glass is always half empty. I mean she has a million excuses why she never did anything. Everybody in this town has an excuse. My dad, he expects me to be all the things he never was. I've got to be number one, best athlete, most popular. I mean, he likes my friends more than I do. I'm so busy living his dreams, it's hard to remember if I ever had any of my own. I'm not so tough. It's late. I should go. I saw him eyeing the carrots. It seems like a lot of work for such a little cup of juice. I mean from what I can tell he only likes red meat and ketchup. I made him a baloney sandwich and he only ate the meat. He hid the bread in the flower pot. Sounds like something Adam would have done. I thought the same thing. ( JUICER WHIRRING ) ( CAR APPROACHING ) ( HORN HONKS ) Hey. You know if you had fun last night we can do it again. It's no bother. I've got nothing better to do. [TRACY] Rufus! Tonight. Same time. What was that about? Is there something you're not telling me? Like what? Like one of your secrets! He likes you, Rufus! It's plain as day. I didn't realize you were so popular. Why does he like you? You liked me. How dare you, Rufus! He tried to rape me. Well, are you sure about that? Clay always gets what he wants, Rufus. Adam would want you to have this. It's his airplane isn't it? You finish it. He'd like that. I thought you'd be happy. There's something wrong with me, Jenny. Oh, Rufus, there's something wrong with all of us. How can you see with all that hair? They were digging a pad for a new grain elevator. You know, I keep hearing people using the phrase "the highway hacker". Where would they get that from? I've used it a few times. That's what I thought. Don't use it again. Okay, we've got enough trouble. We don't need a town afraid to walk the streets. Christ, Chet, you know, you should know better. Crap. So this is our missing trucker, huh? Sure looks like it. I guess we better hope so. How do you work the zoom on this? It's that button on the side. Maybe we'll get interviewed by one of those cop shows. You know, do our own re-creation of the events. Yeah well, I wouldn't count on it. [HUGH] All right well, let's dig him out, huh. All right. [JOE] Hey! You can't be up there. Come on down before you fall and kill yourself. [VAN DUSEN] Nice trick. You didn't really believe until just now. Did you? Why don't you touch me, see if I'm real? It's not gonna be that easy. Rufus, you don't belong here. You know that. Look, don't pretend to know me because you don't. How long do you think it's gonna take for these nice people to figure out what you really are? You're the one who doesn't belong here. You need a friend. Someone who understands. I have friends and they like me just fine. Listen to me. Dr. Bristol said he was my friend. He cut me open to look inside. Why should I trust you? He's been dead for almost 40 years. What he did was wrong. I told him a thousand times, but he wouldn't listen. No one should have to live forever. Why is that so hard to understand? You go back and you tell them I don't exist! What can I get ya? I should go. What do you want, Rufus? Can I get a hamburger, almost raw? Raw? Almost. How much is that? I'll get it. Thank you. Anything to drink? No, thank you. What's wrong? Dennis Mitchell saw us at the batting cage last night. His little brother just called me a faggot. I mean, I'd punch his little face in, but he's only 12. We didn't do anything. No... but I wanted to. Louise wouldn't let me out. She said I was too dangerous. Jenny wants me to go to school but, I'm scared. Want some? Are you kidding me? The thing's probably loaded with E-coli. Why is it so hard to be my friend? It's not hard. It's impossible. [HUGH] Why don't you take your cadaver and get out of town Mr. Van Dusen. I thought I'd see the sights first. I've got a free coupon for the Pioneer Museum, wouldn't want to waste that. You're here for the boy. Is that a question or a statement? What is he to you? What has he done? I don't fully know how to answer that and if I did I'd say it's really none of your business. Well, you don't fully understand the law, Mr. Van Dusen. Because you may be a predator. It's my job to protect that boy. Now I could accuse you of some very nasty business. You've got enough on your plate, Sheriff. So please don't threaten me. Who is he? Why don't you ask him? You're a good man. I can tell- but there are things going on here that you don't fully understand. So please move your car. I have a date with a wagon wheel thank you. We're closed. I know. Clay, I need five minutes of your time. Hmm? How do you know all this stuff, huh? I checked with the hospital. People tend to get hurt when Rufus is around, huh? Just got off to a bad start. That's it. Oh. Can I? It's all right, it's all right, I just wanna see... Yeah. You heal fast. From what I know about Rufus he doesn't do that for everyone. Magic. ( LAUGHS ) Is that what he calls it? Tell me about Tracy McKay? You're not a cop. I mean, why should I tell you anything? Because I came a long way and I'm asking politely. She lives across the street. They're friends. I think they're more than that. Yeah, well, she's a tramp. Everybody knows that slept with a student teacher last year. The guy was like 30 years old. Come on do you really believe that? What does it matter? People believe what they want. Rufus... Rufus can have her. I think you want what she already has. I've seen the way you look at him. I know. I know what's going on. Clay, Rufus is an innocent. He is. He's got charm. It's part of the thing. Stop it. Stop. I need to see this. Please don't threaten me again or this will end very badly for you. Do you hear me? - Yeah. - Do you hear me? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Personally, I think he's a little old for you. Don't let him make a fool of you, Clay. ( HOCKEY GAME OFF SCREEN. ) I'm not sure what you did but my daughter is very unhappy. Can I see Tracy? You know what why don't you just give it a few days. She likes you. Well, he's definitely not the boring type. I think you should go after him. [RUFUS] Clay? ( BAT CLANGS ) He's got a broken arm, three broken ribs and he won't say who or what happened. Chet, make sure we get pictures all around inside here, alright? And bag that shell casing. Who the hell did he shoot? He couldn't have got too far. I mean... Okay, he fires the weapon, ejects the shell, gets clubbed from behind, right? Now how- Well, Mr. Van Dusen. Ah, let's talk. Chet, ah, call every hospital in a 200-mile radius. See if anyone's come in with a gunshot wound. You go it. [VAN DUSEN] August 4th, 1972. Rufus was arrested for shoplifting. It's been verified. I've got affidavits from the arresting officers. Both have retired. The files dated between 1906 and 1934 run close to 38,000 pages, meticulously prepared and quite insightful. Sheriff, Rufus doesn't mean to harm people. He's a freak of nature, he's a one of. Science has never seen anything like him. When was this photo taken? 1927. That makes him almost 100 years old. He's older than that. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. His real age, it's never been determined. He lives in a world of his own. He doesn't perceive time the way you and I do. The invention of the electric light bulb would be a recent event to him. This is a hoax. It's gotta be. I thought so too at first, Sheriff, I did. ( DOOR OPENS ) [CHET] Hugh. Everything okay? Chet, not now. I have come here to retrieve the property of Bristol Anderson Pharmaceuticals, Sheriff, with or without your help. That's why I'm here. - Your property? - Yes. He's a little boy. Is he? Boy's grow into men. Rufus will always be as you see him now. He has the ability to heal himself and the limited capacity to heal others which explains the advanced age of Louise Kettle. His DNA will lead to revolutionary discoveries in heath and science. Can you imagine the human race without sickness and disease. Cut the crap. What kind of a rube do you take me for, Mr. Van Dusen? I know you lost your son. Rufus can't change that. How dare you pry into my private life. Now you take your fantasies and you get out of this town. Understood? You've been warned. ( DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ) Cindy, hi. This is Sheriff Wade. Yeah listen, I'm wondering. Do you have those winter boots with the fur around the top you know, like Tracy McKay wears? Oh yeah. Expensive, huh? Well, what size would she be? Like size seven? Eight? Size seven, huh. That's what I figured. Yes, I know she lives across the street, Cindy. Thanks. Four pair in stock. All right. Thank you, yeah. I didn't sleep last night. I would have killed him. No, you wouldn't. It's not in you. I'll see ya later. ( CAR DOOR CLOSES ) Tracy. My mother bought my first suit here, a little clip-on bow tie. I was the sharpest six-year-old in town. I know Tracy was at the batting cage last night. She was? Don't "she was" me, Rufus. You guys are thick as thieves. What the hell happened with Clay? I thought he was my friend... guess I was wrong. What did you do? I lived! He wanted me dead! Why would Clay want you dead? Stop pretending! I could have torn him to pieces. You know what I can do. I should never have let you stay. I guess. Fork, not your fingers, Rufus. You know Chet's nephew, he's epileptic. You wouldn't know it to look at him but uh, he definitely is. I mean I've never seen him have a fit. Kid, you have this. It's a little rare for me. [JENNIFER] I can stick it in the microwave. It's too late for that. Isn't it, Rufus? I'll grab a sandwich out. ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Just go away! Louise is dead, Rufus. You can't take care of yourself. You've already proven that. I'm not goin' back. And you can't make me. Louise wasn't protecting you. She was protecting others from you. You're trouble. You always will be. No! No, I'm not! No, I'm not. I know you don't want to harm these people. I do. I like it here. I know you do. But it's time to come home before you hurt anybody else. It won't be like before. I promise. I promise. You should see that kid throw. Who? Rufus, the kid's a natural. I spoke to the lab. If you want a DNA analysis of that blood sample it's going to cost $3,800.00. That's a little steep, isn't it? Yeah. Oh man, I was hoping to get a new cruiser this year. You know I was looking at that Ford Interceptor. That'd be my vote. Ford Explorer's kind of nice too. It's got more cargo space. And cup holders. Yeah. Hugh, are you gonna tell me what's going on? You wouldn't believe me. ( CAR DOOR SLAMS ) Shouldn't we have a warrant? Your mom owns the hotel, right? She has the right to inspect the rooms. We're just helping her out. Now you stay out here and keep your eyes open. What if he comes back? I don't know, Chet. Buy him a coffee. Stall him. Don't let him in the room. Great. Chet! ( DOOR OPENS ) [CHET] Find somethin'? ( DOOR CLOSES ) [CHET] Oh, my God. Tracy? Who's car is that? He's come to take Rufus. Who's in my house? I've never seen him before. Call Hugh, now! I don't know if I should take anything. None of it's mine. What are you doing here? He's a friend, Jenny. A 50-year-old man is not a friend. You wouldn't understand. No. My husband is about to come home any minute. I think you should leave. Rufus, why don't you go outside, please. I never wanted to hurt anyone. It's okay. Jennifer, I've known about Rufus for a very very long time. He was just passing through here. You know that. I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you're not taking my boy anywhere. Your boy's been dead for 12 years. - You're not taking him! - This is not your boy. He doesn't belong to you. Please. I am not going to let you take him. - I have to take the boy. - No. ( SCREAMS ) Stop. Sorry. ( ROARS ) ( GROWLING ) ( ROARS ) ( ROARS ) Jen! Jesus Christ. ( DOG BARKING ) He seemed a little nervous. He looked cute with his new haircut. Yeah, he did. Very handsome. Are we crazy? A little, but he'll be just fine. It's too short. Isn't it? It makes you look younger. Really? Don't worry. It'll grow back. I got something for you. I'm dead for sure. Only if you show it to someone. Go.
