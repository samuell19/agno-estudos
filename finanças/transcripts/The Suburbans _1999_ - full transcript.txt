** [ Rock ] [ Man ] THE SUBURBANS. WELCOME TO AMERICAN BANDSTAND. I MEAN, HERE YOU ARE, BARELY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, TOURING THE COUNTRY WITH A NUMBER ONE HIT RECORD. HOW DO YOU FEEL ? UH, WELL, IT'S A LOT OF FUN, BUT IT GETS, UH-- IT FEELS EXCELLENT, DICK. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE CASH. I LIKE THOSE NEAT, LITTLE MEALS THEY SERVE YOU ON THE PLANE. [ Cheering ] HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS NEW MUSIC TELEVISION CHANNEL THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ? A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS COULD CHANGE MUSIC FOREVER. MUSIC TELEVISION. YEAH. I'VE HEARD OF THAT, BUT I'M NOT SURE I GET IT. THEY'VE GOT THESE LITTLE FILMS THEY PLAY ALONG WITH THE SONGS, SO YOU CAN WATCH AS WELL AS LISTEN. I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE WANT YOU TO TELL 'EM WHAT TO PICTURE WHEN THEY LISTEN TO THE SONGS. I MEAN, I JUST DON'T SEE THAT TAKING OFF AT ALL, DICK. IT SORT OF SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THE NAZIS WOULD'VE COME UP WITH... IF THEY'D GOTTEN INTO POP MUSIC. I-I WOULDN'T WATCH IT. LET'S LEAVE THE ACTING TO THE ACTORS... AND MUSIC TO THE MUSIC, MAN. WELL, GOOD LUCK. I'M SURE YOU'VE GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE SUBURBANS ! [ Cheering, Applauding ] ** [ Rock ] ** * WELL, THANKS FOR THE SAME OPINIONS * * NOW TELL ME SOMETHIN' I DON'T KNOW * * AND ONCE I'LL FINISH BITCHIN' * * GO I SAID, GO * * GO GO, GO, GO * * DON'T WAIT FOR INVITATIONS * * I SAID, GO, GO, GO [ Woman ] DAN !

WERE YOU NOT AWARE PEOPLE GET PREGNANT THAT WAY ? I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. DID YOU-- I-I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT'S THAT ? WHAT ? SINCE WHEN IS A BRIEFCASE DE RIGUEUR WEDDING ATTIRE ? I HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS TO DISCUSS WITH JULES. OW ! THIS IS GIL AND AMANDA'S WEDDING. IT'S NOT CAREER DAY. I WAS AWARE OF THAT. THANK YOU. RORY'S NOT BRINGING ANOTHER BLIND DATE... NO, HE'S GOT SOME SUPPOSEDLY HOT NEW GIRLFRIEND. HE MUST'VE MENTIONED SHE WAS A FORMER MODEL 17 TIMES IN A 2-MINUTE CONVERSATION. [ Children Yelling ] YOU BETTER TELL ME YOU GOT YOUR SPARE CUMMERBUND IN THERE. THIS THING ? YOU KIDDIN' ME ? IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET A SHOT AT JULES MARCELLE. I'M GONNA EXPAND MY INSURANCE OFFICES ALL OVER THE ISLAND. RORY, WE'RE GONNA BE LATE. WHERE'S YOUR COVER GIRL ? SHE'S RETIRED NOW, BUT SHE WAS HUGE AT ONE POINT. PARIS. MILAN. ALL OVER THE PLACE. EVERYWHERE. IS THERE ANY CHANCE SHE COULD INTERRUPT HER BUSY INTERNATIONAL SCHEDULE... TO COME OUT HERE TO THE CAR ? I'M TRYIN'. YOU SHOULD SEE THE BABY. IT'S LATCHED TO HER BREAST LIKE A DEER TICK. HI ! [ Rory ] HONEY, ARE THE KIDS SETTLED WITH THE SITTER ? CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND ? TROUBLE. MOMMY, ARE WE THERE YET ? MOMMY, ARE WE THERE YET ? MOMMY, ARE WE THERE YET ? * GO, GO, GO IS IT BAD, DR. WAGONHOFFER ? DR. WAGONHOFFER ? ONE SECOND. ** [ Guitar ] EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR. IS THIS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR YOU ? I ALMOST HAVE IT. I JUST NEED A GOOD BRIDGE. A GOOD BRIDGE ? SWEETHEART, IS IT NECESSARY TO BREAST-FEED... IN FRONT OF ALL THESE STRANGE PEOPLE NOW ? [ Children Laughing ] [ Man ] OH, NICE TRY, GUYS. JULES IS ALL MINE. [ Grace ] JUST BECAUSE AMANDA'S FATHER INVESTED IN GIL'S BUSINESS... DOES NOT MEAN HE'S INTERESTED IN YOUR ENTREPRENEURIAL ASPIRATIONS. [ Dan ] OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF THE FACT THAT GIL'S FATHER-IN-LAW IS SICILIAN. ANYBODY'S WHO'S SEEN THE GODFATHER KNOWS THAT A SICILIAN... CANNOT DENY ANY REQUESTS ON HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING DAY. [ Grace] PLEASE LET ME OUT OF THIS CAR. ** [ Ends ] [ Squeaking ] IT'S JUST SO HARD TO KEEP IT CLEAN OUT HERE WITH ALL THE SALT IN THE AIR. MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON GETTING MARRIED FIRST. THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU. OH, YEAH. THANKS. OH, HEY. GUYS, UH-- [ Exhales ] THANKS FOR BEING HERE FOR ME. YEAH, SURE. DON'T TOUCH THE CAR THOUGH, SERIOUSLY. [ Priest ] YOU, GIL, YOU, AMANDA, AND ALL OF GOD'S CHILDREN... REALIZE IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES... IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE... WHEN GOD HAS FOUND US SOMEONE WE CAN LOVE AND TRUST. FOR IT IS OUR SALVATION... TO MAKE AN EVERLASTING COMMITMENT TO THAT PERSON. [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] AND LET GOD SEAL IT... WITH THE BONDS OF HOLY MATRIMONY. I THINK WHOEVER GOES FIRST DEFINITELY HAS THE ADVANTAGE. SECOND IS THE KEY SLOT, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. FIRST GUY WARMS HIM UP. HE'S WORN OUT BY THE TIME THE THIRD GUY OPENS HIS MOUTH. I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS. YOU'RE HOPING I'M GONNA GO SECOND SO YOU CAN GO LAST. FORGET IT. I'M THIRD. FINE. I'LL GO FIRST. WELL, GOOD. GET IN THERE THEN. NICE TRY. I'M FIRST. IF WE DO FORM OUR OWN LABEL... AND RELEASE THE MICK WAGNER CD-- I'M ONLY PROMOTING THE ONE NIGHT SO FAR, AND IT'S-- IT'S HARD TO SAY. A SOUL CLUB, HUH ? ANYWAY, UH, WITH MY NAME, WE'LL DEFINITELY GET A LOT OF AIRPLAY. AND THEN WE'LL GET THE MAJOR LABELS INTO A KIND OF BIDDING WAR. [ Mumbling ] WHY DON'T I JUST... PLAY THE, UH, SONG FOR YOU. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. I GOT A BUNION RIGHT THERE. IT'S KILLIN' ME. THE BLACK PEOPLE AREN'T COMING BECAUSE IT'S IN A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE WHITE PEOPLE AREN'T COMING BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S ONLY FOR BLACK PEOPLE. [ Mumbling ] YOU KNOW, I'M OUT GIGGIN' MOST NIGHTS. WHICH I FIND TO BE VERY SAD, BECAUSE I-I BELIEVE SOUL MUSIC TO BE THE, UH, THE GREAT COMMON DENOMINATOR, SIR, DON'T YOU ? NO. YEAH. [ Mumbling, Yelling ] JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY ! [ Crowd Murmuring ] [ All Yelling ] I CAUGHT IT ! HA-HA ! HA-HA ! [ Applauding ] ** [ Rock On Radio ] WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WAXED THIS THING, DAN ? I THOUGHT IT CAME WITH WAX ON IT. YOU NEED TO WAX IT. [ Rory ] ALL I KNOW IS I'M RUINED. OKAY, FINE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO INVEST. BUT WAS IT NECESSARY TO CANCEL THE POLICY ON HIS ROLLS ? I'LL LET YOU INSURE MY ROLLS WHEN I MAKE IT HUGE AGAIN. NO OFFENSE, MITCH. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO PUT IT TO BED ? WHERE WAS YOUR LAST GIG ? THE NASSAU COMMUNITY COLLEGE RATHSKELLER ? YOU KNOW, ISN'T IT GETTIN' A LITTLE OLD TRYIN' TO GET OVER ON THESE YOUNG CHICKS... WITH THAT TIRED ROCK AND ROLL RAP OF YOURS ? YOU WANT TO GIVE UP AND BE A CHUBBY INSURANCE AGENT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, GO AHEAD. YOU KNOW, MITCH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET YOURSELF SOME COUNSELING, BECAUSE A LIFE OF LONELINESS AND DESPAIR... IS ALL THAT'S IN STORE FOR YOU, BY THE WAY. YOU KNOW, RORY, I'D APPRECIATE IT... IF YOU'D KEEP YOUR MORBID, SPIRITUAL CRISES TO YOURSELF... AND LET THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO LEAD A NICE, SHALLOW, UNEXAMINED EXISTENCE... FREE TO DO SO. CRAIG WAS SO GREAT IN THE BEGINNING. OH, HE WAS SO STRONG AND STABLE. BUT THEN HE, UH-- HIS CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS WENT BAD, AND HE STARTED DRINKING TOO MUCH. THEN HE TOOK IT OUT ON ME AND THE KIDS. COULD YOU HOLD MAX FOR A SECOND ? SURE. HE'S NOT, UH, STILL BOTHERING YOU, IS HE ? NO. NO. THANK GOD. NOT-- NOT SINCE THE FIRE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE BURNED YOUR HOUSE DOWN AND GOT AWAY WITH IT. IT'S LEGAL TO BURN YOUR OWN HOUSE DOWN, IF YOU WANT TO. NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THAT. OH. THAT'S HANDY TO KNOW. WE WERE OUT OF TOWN THOUGH, SO IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO HURT ANYONE. ** [ Disco ] ALL RIGHT ! YOU GO, GIRL ! LOOK AT HER GO ! NOW YOU'RE BOOGEYIN' ! YOU WANT TO DROP ME AT THE TRAIN STATION IN THE MORNING ? I'VE GOT SOME PUBLISHERS' MEETINGS IN THE CITY. I WAS PLANNING ON GOING DOWN THERE TO LAY ON THE TRACKS ANYWAY. HEY. EVERYTHING WORKS OUT. YOU KNOW THAT. MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING. IT'S A GOOD THING THAT ANOTHER ONE OF MY ATTEMPTS AT SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS... WAS DASHED AGAINST THE JAGGED COASTLINE OF HARSH REALITY ? NO, MAYBE IT'S A SIGN OR SOMETHING THAT IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE, YOU KNOW ? I MEAN, YOU'RE-- YOU'RE 35 YEARS OLD, DANNY. I'M GETTING VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIRECTION THIS CONVERSATION IS TAKING. AND SOMETIMES THE UNIVERSE GIVES US SIGNALS, AND WE HAVE TO BE OPEN TO NEW THINGS. OH, NO. THIS IS TROUBLE. DANNY, WE NEED TO TALK-- AND THERE THEY ARE-- THE FOUR MOST DREADED WORDS IN THE ENGLISH VOCABULARY. ABOUT THIS MORNING. I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD. [ DJ ] AND NOW, OUR NEXT HAPPY COUPLE ! BELIEVE ME. IT CAME AS MUCH A SURPRISE TO ME AS IT'S COMING TO YOU, BUT I-- I WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT, AND-- I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN. I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN. YOU KNOW THAT. BUT I JUST FELT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING WAS... THIS ANCIENT, UH, INSTINCTUAL MOTHER IN ME... JUST BROKE THROUGH MY MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS. AND I WANTED TO-- I WANTED TO MOTHER. I WANTED TO SUCKLE THE WORLD, AND I WANT TO NURTURE. I WANT TO BE A MOM. OKAY, UH, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I THINK THAT YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS ABOUT YOUR BOOK, THAT'S ALL. YOU'RE PUTTING YEARS OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OUT THERE... AND EXPOSING YOURSELF TO REJECTION FROM ANY NUMBER OF IDIOTIC PUBLISHERS. I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD. YEAH. A CHILD ? WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT ? I DON'T THINK YOU'RE AWARE OF THE FACT... THAT CHILDREN ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PEOPLE. IT'S NORMAL TO BE AFRAID. I'M NOT AFRAID, GRACE. OH. MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO ONE OF THOSE SPERM BANKS OR SOMETHING. SPERM BANK ? YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. HAVE THE FATHER OF YOUR CHILD BE SOMEBODY WHO'S REDUCED TO JERKING OFF FOR A LIVING. OH, DANNY. NO, NO. THAT'S GREAT. "AND WHAT DOES THE FATHER DO ?" "HE'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL, PROFESSIONAL MASTURBATOR." PLEASE, HONEY, FORGET THAT MANIAC. YOU GOT ME NOW. LISTEN, LARA. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHIN'. WHEN THAT PRIEST WAS UP THERE EARLIER, I FELT LIKE HE WAS TALKIN' DIRECTLY TO ME, LIKE GOD WAS TALKIN' TO ME. AND I JUST THINK THAT YOU AND I ARE SO PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER... THAT WE-- HEY. HEY, LARA. HI. LITTLE BOY. LISTEN, RORY, CAN I, UH, TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND ? COME HERE. SHE OKAY ? SHE LOOKS A LITTLE SICK. LISTEN. YOU GOTTA HELP ME OUT HERE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON BACK THERE. I AM SO CLOSE TO LANDING SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE. SHE'S A LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN THE AIR FORCE. YOU GOTTA SEE THE BRASS ON THIS ONE. HER HUSBAND GOT DRUNK, LEFT WITH THE CATERER. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY ? ANYWAY, WE GOTTA PLAY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ? PLAY WHAT ? US, THE SUBURBANS. "BY MY SIDE," OUR ONE PATHETIC LITTLE HIT. IT WAS HER FAVORITE SONG. WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT ? I DON'T KNOW, MITCH. COME ON, MAN. COME ON. COME ON. I'M BEGGING YOU. SHE'S ON FIRE. WE HAVEN'T PLAYED IN YEARS. I CAN CLOSE THIS DEAL IF WE PLAY. WE HAVEN'T PLAYED IN-- WHO'S MY CHUBBY LITTLE ROCK STAR ? DON'T START WITH THAT. WHO'S MY CHUBBY LITTLE ROCK STAR... WHO I GOT LAID CONSTANTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL ? [ Yells ] DO THIS. DO THIS FOR ME. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. HI, EVERYBODY. WELL, THANKS FOR COMING AND MAKING MY WEDDING SO SPECIAL. BUT GET READY FOR A BIG SURPRISE. WITH US TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 YEARS, BY REQUEST, THE CUTEST BASS PLAYER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, FORMER TEEN SENSATIONS, THE SUBURBANS ! [ Baby Crying ] [ Light Applause ] [ Rory ] UH, IT GOES THE OTHER WAY, GIL. [ Crying Continues ] [ Cymbal Crashes ] [ Microphone Feeding Back ] [ Woman ] WHOOPS.

SHE'S AN OFFICER, MITCH. NOT TO MENTION SHE'S A MARRIED OFFICER. YOU KNOW, WE'RE AT A WEDDING. YOU UNDERSTAND ? YOU BURN FOR THIS KIND OF THING. LOOK. I TOLD YOU. WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN IN UNIFORM, I DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL. IT'S SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION. SOMETHING JUST TAKES OVER. AS FOR THE FIRE AND DAMNATION PART, I AM WILLING TO GAMBLE THAT THIS IS ALL THERE IS. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT. THAT'S MY CHOICE. [ Woman ] COME ON, MITCH. THROW ME THE ROPE. OKAY, UH, I JUST WANTED TO PLAY THIS SONG I KNOW. I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON IT. I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A BRIDGE YET. AH, LET'S SEE HERE. I WANT TO GET US A LITTLE FURTHER OUT... FOR THE ACOUSTICS. OW ! FUCK ! [ Laughing ] HI. I'M CATE WITH A "C." I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU'RE WITH THE SUBURBANS, RIGHT ? UH, YEAH. I MEAN, I AM. I MEAN, I WAS. YEAH, I SAW YOU GUYS PLAY EARLIER. YOU WERE THE BOMB. OH, I'M SORRY. NO, I-I MEAN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE REALLY GREAT. GOD, THIS IS SO FUNNY, BECAUSE I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SUBURBANS, AND THEN I WIND UP HERE AT THIS WEDDING AND HERE YOU ARE PLAYING. WHAT A TRIP. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES ? OH, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE. "AND TO US SEEMS MEREST ACCIDENT SPRINGS FROM THE DEEPEST SOURCE OF DESTINY." JOHANN CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH von SCHILLER. OH, HE SAID THAT TOO, HUH ? YEAH. GOD, THINGS LIKE THIS ARE HAPPENING TO ME ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, I GUESS COINCIDENCES ARE HAPPENING IN EVERYBODY'S LIVES. YOU JUST KIND OF HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. I SHOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF. THAT WOULD-- THAT WOULD BE GOOD. HI. I AM THE EAST COAST SENIOR VICE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CREATIVE MANAGEMENT... OF SPECIAL PROJECTS AT ELEKTRAGRAM VIASCOPE INTERNATIONAL. UH, DANNY MORAN. I'M THE SENIOR LIFEGUARD OVER AT LOOKOUT BEACH. I'M ALL OUT OF CARDS. ANYWAY, UM, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING, WITH THE WHOLE '80s REVIVAL THING GOING ON, THAT IF THERE WAS A BAND THAT REALLY DEFINED THAT SOUND, IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE YOU GUYS, BUT YOU NEVER GOT THE CREDIT YOU DESERVED. EIGHTIES REVIVAL ? YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE DID THE '50s IN THE '70s, THE '60s IN THE '80s, AND WE'RE ALREADY DONE WITH THE '70s... BEFORE THE '90s ARE EVEN OVER, WHICH MEANS... WE NEED TO JAM IN THE '80s BEFORE THE MILLENNIUM. YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE STARTED FEELING NOSTALGIC FOR A WHOLE CENTURY. THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING. A WHOLE REINTRODUCTION CONCEPT, YOU KNOW ? TOUR, VIDEO, MERCHANDISING, TRIBUTE ALBUMS. KIND OF SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE. DO I LOOK SUNBURNED TO YOU ? OH, THERE'S MY RIDE. [ Horn Honking ] ANYWAY, VERY, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. CALL ME. OW ! OW ! I DIDN'T MEAN THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY WOULD LOOK SAD, PATHETIC... AND RIDICULOUS DOING A COMEBACK. I JUST MEANT THAT SOMETIMES THESE THINGS CAN COME OFF A LITTLE-- [ Sighs ] OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT ? I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANY MORE. JUST-- JUST COME TO BED. DON'T YOU SEE, GRACE ? IT FINALLY ALL MAKES SENSE. I MEAN, THIS IS WHY NONE OF MY OTHER VENTURES PANNED OUT, BECAUSE IF THEY HAD... I WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS, MY ACTUAL DESTINY ITSELF. OH, JEEZ. I MEAN, THAT RECORD COMPANY GIRL AT THE WEDDING. I MEAN, DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A COINCIDENCE TO YOU ? UH, IT SOUNDS LIKE STALKING. WELL, IT'S NOT JUST HER BY THE WAY, OKAY ? IT'S EVI. THERE'S A WHOLE HUGE COMPANY INTO IT. OKAY, DANNY. YOUR HAPPINESS IS MY TOP PRIORITY, WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW I'VE WASTED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THERAPY. BUT, UH, THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER. I'M JUST CONCERNED. THAT'S ALL. WHY THE SUBURBANS ANYWAY ? WHY NOW ? APPARENTLY, WE DEFINED A SOUND. THOSE WERE HER WORDS. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY, YOU KNOW ? WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE DEALS WHERE A HUGE COMPANY... BUYS UP THE RIGHTS TO AN OLD BAND'S MUSIC... AND JUST WANTS TO RING THE LAST BIT OF REVENUE OUT OF THEM... BEFORE TOSSING THE DRIED-OUT, FESTERING, DECOMPOSING RIND BACK ON THE SCRAP HEAP ? IS THAT A QUESTION OR A POEM ? I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET HURT AGAIN. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU ALL PUMPED UP... AND DROP EVERYTHING JUST TO HAVE IT VANISH AGAIN. IT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO BOUNCE BACK THE LAST TIME. GRACE, I NEED TO TRY SOMETHING. I MEAN, AT LEAST I HAD SOME SUCCESS AT THIS, NO MATTER HOW SHORT-LIVED, WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID FOR EVERYTHING ELSE I'VE DONE. I JUST-- I NEED TO FEEL LIKE I'M GOOD AT SOMETHING, LIKE I'M OF SOME VALUE TO THE WORLD. SOMETHING TO OFFER. BABY, I'D FEEL LIKE YOU HAD SOMETHIN' TO OFFER IF YOU WERE... THE DISHWASHER AT JACK IN THE BOX. JACK IN THE BOX DOESN'T HAVE DISHES. YOU REALLY WANT THIS ? THEN I'M WITH YOU. BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT I WILL NOT TOLERATE, AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR ME VERY CLEARLY ON THIS. I WILL NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GO BACK TO WEARING HIGH HEELS WITH SOCKS. YOU UNDERSTAND ME, MR. BIG ? [ Yells ] [ Baby Crying ] [ Moaning ] OH, YOU KNOW, I-- WHAT'S WRONG, BABY ? I-I'M SORRY. WHAT IS IT ? IT JUST-- IT JUST HAPPENS SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. DANNY. LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO TO SLEEP. BUT, DANNY, YOU HAVE AN ERECTION. WHAT ? WHAT, THAT ? NO, I DON'T-- THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I MEAN, THAT'S-- THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT SEXUAL. [ Laughs ] I MEAN, IT'S-- I KNOW THAT WON'T LAST. DANNY ! [ All Screaming ] [ Man ] I KNOW WE'RE IN A BIG, GIANT BOARDROOM, AND IT'S EVI-- WHOO ! I MEAN, THIS IS BASICALLY THE COMPANY YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT HERE, OKAY ? THE COMPANY IS DADDY AND ME. IT'S TWO GUYS. YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT THE WHOLE COMPANY. YOU CAN TEAR DOWN THE BUILDING, GO TO THE FOUNDATION. IT COULD BE ME AND HIM IN A PIT. YOU'D STILL HAVE THE SAME COMPANY, OKAY ? EVER HEAR OF THE TEMP TONES ? NO. NEITHER DID I. I TOLD BERRY GORDY, "IT'S THE TEMPTATIONS ! YOU CALL IT THE TEMPTATIONS !" THAT'S THE WAY-- BERRY. BERRY. BERRY. BERRY. IT WAS BERRY BEFORE HE WENT TO HIS HEAD, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? THEN HE GOT THE JACKSONS AND EVERYTHING WENT BOOM-BOOM. THE POINT IS, WE'RE FAMILY HERE, OKAY ? THIS IS TWO GUYS-- YOU EVER HEAR OF SYLVESTER AND THE FAMILY STONE ? [ All Mumbling ] SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE ! [ All ] AH. STREET CRED. AND CAN I JUST BE-- BY THE WAY, CAN I JUST BE A FAN FOR TWO SECONDS... AND TELL YOU GUYS THAT I'M LOOKIN' AT YOU, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M BACK IN 1982 ? I'M IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE GREMLIN FIGURING OUT THE FACTS OF LIFE AND I'M-- * RIGHT ON MY SIDE I'M HEARING THE SONG * * IT'S IN MY HEAD AND I'M GETTIN' HOME ** I MEAN, IT WAS A WHOLE THING. SO, FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW, I FEEL A LITTLE VULNERABLE. I FEEL LIKE I NEED YOU. I'M A LITTLE BABY RIGHT NOW, OKAY ? I'M A LITTLE BABY... SAYING, "HELLO. GIVE IT TO ME." I GOT MY DIAPER DOWN. I GOT IT ALL OUT AND I'M SAYING, "I'M A LITTLE, SCARED CHIPMUNK THAT WANTS YOU." GIVE IT TO ME. HOW DO I GET IT ? HOW DO I GET THE SUBHUMANS ? [ All ] UH, SUBURBANS. SUBURBANS. THAT'S BETTER. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. [ All ] SUBURBANS. HELLO ? I CAN'T HEAR YOU. [ All ] SUBURBANS. I'M HEARING AN IRANIAN MAN WHO'S TELLING ME THAT HE'S STUCK IN A PUDDLE. I'M SORRY. I'M ON A THING TO LONDON. I GOT A CONFERENCE GOING. HE'S TALKIN' TO LONDON. WHAT ? SPEAK UP. YES, NOW I GOT YOU. WELL, RODERICK, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF FOCUS. AS YOU CAN SEE, WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND IS NOT JUST A SIMPLE REISSUE, BUT A COMPLETE CONCEPT TO ESTABLISH THE SUBURBANS... IN THE COLLECTIVE, CULTURAL PSYCHE OF THE POST-BOOMER, PRE-MILLENNIAL DEMOGRAPHIC. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. THAT'S A VERY SMART IDEA. THANK YOU. UH, CATE, NOT THAT I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T, BUT I WAS JUST-- WHY WOULD YOU MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THE SUBURBANS ? WE JUST HAD THE ONE HIT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ? THAT'S A VALID QUESTION, AND I THINK THAT I CAN ANSWER IT FOR YOU. SURE, THERE WERE A LOT OF BANDS IN THE EARLY '80s... THAT HAD A HIT OR TWO AND THEN DISAPPEARED. [ Cell Phone Ringing ] BUT NONE THAT WERE AS YOUTHFUL AND PROMISING, YET SELF-DESTRUCTED SO PUBLICLY. SURE, DANNY VOMITED ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. YES, MITCH FACED A VERY EMBARRASSING TRIAL AGAINST A VIDEOTAPED LIAISON... WITH TWO 15-YEAR-OLD CLERKS IN A SYOSSET CONVENIENCE STORE, NOT TO MENTION THE THING... WITH THE TRANSVESTITE SECURITY GUARD IN THE SUNRISE MALL IN MASSAPEQUA. IF I CAN INTERJECT FOR JUST ONE SECOND. I THINK THOSE GIRLS HAD TO LIE ON THE APPLICATIONS ABOUT THEIR AGE, OR THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THE JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK THE JUDGE TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. AND SECONDLY, THE SECURITY GUARD WAS A TRANSSEXUAL, WHICH MEANS THAT OFFICIALLY HE WAS A WOMAN AT THE TIME, FOR THE RECORD. PLEASE DON'T BE SHY. THE WORSE IT WAS THEN, THE MORE THEY LOVE YOU TODAY. IN THAT CASE, THAT GUY GAVE THE BEST BLOW JOB I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. REALLY ? WELL, UM-- RORY. GOD, I CAN IMAGINE THE HUMILIATION YOU MUST HAVE FELT... HAVING TO CLAIM BANKRUPTCY AFTER INCURRING... AN $11 MILLION DEBT WHEN YOUR TOTAL GROSS INCOME WAS ONLY $200,000. DID GO A LITTLE TOO HARD. SEE, IT'S JUST THOSE INDISCRETIONS... THAT WILL HUMANIZE AND ENDEAR YOU TO THE AUDIENCE TODAY. THE MORE PATHETIC YOU WERE THEN, THE MORE SYMPATHETIC YOU ARE NOW. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BAD. WELL, WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HEAR WHAT'S SHE'S SAYING, 'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S TRUE, OKAY ? THIS GIRL IS-- HOLD ON A SECOND. THIS GIRL, SHE'S, LIKE-- IT'S FREAKY WHAT SHE DOES, BECAUSE SHE'S, LIKE, A DIVINING THING TO FIND WATER. HER HEAD IS-- TILT YOUR HEAD DOWN. ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE'S LIKE A DOUSING STICK. I MEAN, I'M JOKING, BUT I'M ALSO SERIOUS. WHO SIGNED STEELY T ? WHO WANTED TO RELEASE "MEET MY FOO PAPA BITTY PARTS"? HER. WHO SIGNED STOOL THIS YEAR ? TWENTY-SIX MILLION UNITS MOVED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. ALL RIGHT ? HER. DOUBLE PLATINUM, BY THE WAY. WE'RE INTO SOMETHING VERY EXCITING HERE. LOOK, I THOUGHT THAT WE'D START WITH THE REMASTERED VERSION OF THE SINGLE "BY MY SIDE." WE'LL DO A VIDEO FOR THAT, GET THAT IN HEAVY ROTATION ON MTV... AND THE 168 RADIO STATIONS THAT WE HAVE A VERY, VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH. WE'RE VERY EXCITED. WE WILL MOVE YOU INTO A LIVE-IN REHEARSAL SPACE. THERE WE'LL SHOOT B ROLL OF YOUR DAILY LIVES, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AND ALL THAT STUFF. THAT WILL THEN BE CUT INTO THE "MAKING THE RECORD" SPECIAL... AND THE LIVE CONCERT SPECIAL THAT WILL SHOW ON EVI CABLE IN A PAY-PER-VIEW EXTRAVAGANZA. PAY-PER-VIEW. SICK. PAY-PER-VIEW. OKAY ? THIS WOMAN'S A FREAK. YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT A FREAK. ALL SHE CARES ABOUT IS THIS. SHE'S INTO THIS. ALL RIGHT ? SKATEBOARD. YOU GUYS. FACES ON IT. I MEAN, BRAND. WHAT ? RIGHT. [ Whispers ] CONTRACTS. OKAY, THOSE ARE CONTRACTS, I GUESS, AND BASICALLY... [ Hiccups ] YOU GUYS GOTTA SIGN THEM OR WHATEVER YOU DO, JUST WHERE THEY TELL YOU TO SIGN BY, UH-- WHEN DID WE SAY ? 5:00 TODAY, OR ELSE WE CAN'T DO THE DEAL. BY 5:00 ? THAT SEEMS REALLY SHORT. IS THAT WEIRD ? IS IT WEIRD ? YES, IT IS WEIRD. THE WHOLE THING IS WEIRD. I MEAN, FRANKLY, FOR ME, IT'S WEIRD. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M HERE SIGNING YOU GUYS. YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING IN 15 YEARS. I'M HAVING TO GO WITH A GUT THING... THAT SHE'S TELLING ME ABOUT, WHICH IS WONDERFUL... BECAUSE, BY THE WAY, SHE DOESN'T GET GUT THINGS A LOT. SHE'S GOING OUT ON A LIMB FOR YOU GUYS, WHICH IS WONDERFUL. THAT EXCITES ME THAT YOU'RE TAKING A CHANCE WITH YOUR JOB. IT EXCITES ME THAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA COME THROUGH... HOPEFULLY IN A WAY IF WE CAN, YOU KNOW, MAKE THIS DEAL HAPPEN. SO, YES, IT IS WEIRD. IT'S VERY WEIRD, BUT HOPEFULLY GOOD WEIRD. [ Phone Ringing ] EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND. HELLO ? YES ? OH, YEAH. OKAY. I GOT FINKLER. [ Choking ] YEAH, I KNOW. PUT HIM THROUGH. BITCH. FUCKIN' ASSHOLE. HEY, SCOOTER. WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME ? OKAY, SO THAT'S YOUR COUNTER ? OKAY. SO, YOU'RE TELLIN' ME YOUR BOY-- OOH. HE'S BIG WILLY. MOVES 20,000 UNITS ONE WEEK. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S GONNA TAKE HIS DICK, SHOVE IT DOWN MY THROAT LIKE THAT... BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S MR. MAMA PAJAMA ? [ Choking Continues ] DO ME A FAVOR, OKAY ? TELL HIM TO TAKE THAT SAME DICK, PUT SOME PEANUT BUTTER ON IT, SHOVE HIS GRANDMA'S BOOTY ABOUT AS WIDE AS THE MOON... AND TAKE IT ALL THE WAY UP THERE 'CAUSE SHE'S GOT A TEA PARTY COMIN' SHE'S NEVER SEEN BEFORE. MORE TO FOLLOW. MORE TO FOLLOW ! HE'LL CALL BACK. I'M HAVIN' DINNER WITH HIM TONIGHT. [ All ] AH. I'M EXCITED. I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE FUN. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME. WHAT IF IT'S SOME BEAUTIFUL, EXOTIC LOCATION ? IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU. [ Grace ] I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR ON THAT GQ SURFER BOY JOB. SURFER BOY ? YEAH, IT'S A PROFILE ON SOME 19-YEAR-OLD PROFESSIONAL SURFER... TURNED TOP MODEL IN BALI. NOW, I'VE GOT TO SPEND, LIKE, A WEEK GLUED TO THE GUY AND DOCUMENT HIS EVERY MOVE. IT'S PRETTY BORING SHIT, RIGHT ? BUT THE MONEY'S GREAT. MODEL/SURFER, HUH ? I DON'T REMEMBER YOU MENTIONING THAT. YEAH, I THINK I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT. ANYWAY, YOU KNOW I DON'T DO WELL IN THESE BIG GROUP SITUATIONS. [ Doorbell Ringing ] IT'S YOUR THING, AND YOU'LL BE WORKING. I'LL JUST BE IN THE WAY ANYWAY. HI. HI. GIVE ME TEN MINUTES TO PACK. COME ON, MITCH. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ? I CAN'T DO THAT. MITCH, DON'T BE A BABY. GET IN THERE. THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY. THIS IS WHAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE. MITCH, GET YOUR SHIT AND LET'S GO. THANK YOU ! THIS IS ABUSE. COME ON. * WHERE ARE YOU RUBIN KINCAID * * TRYING TO SEARCH YOUR TRADING VOWS * * FIRST-ROUND PICK IN THE WAITING LOUNGE * [ Horn Honking ] * PICKED UP PACE AND YOU'RE STILL WITH ME * * JUST IN TIME FOR SYMPATHY * * WHERE ARE YOU RUBIN KINCAID * * WHERE ARE YOU RUBIN KINCAID * [ Horn Honking ] [ Yelling ] * WHERE ARE YOU RUBIN KINCAID ** ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

[ Gil ] DO WE HAVE TO BE HERE LONGER THAN AN HOUR ? ISN'T THIS GENIUS ? I MEAN, THE SUBURBANS IN THE SUBURBS. MTV IS GOING TO DIE FOR THIS. [ All Screaming ] "SO, WE BEAT ON. BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT, BORNE BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST." EXCUSE ME. F. SCOTT FITZGERALD ? [ All ] OH ! OKAY, THEN. I GUESS I SHOULD ASSIGN SOME ROOMS, AND YOU GUYS SHOULD START REHEARSING IN THE GARAGE. JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS, HUH ? YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ? I'M TUNIN' MY DRUMS. WELL, SET 'EM UP THEN. THEY ARE SET UP. RORY, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, BUT THE DRUMS GO IN THE BACK. SAYS WHO ? IS THERE SOME KIND OF BAND RULE BOOK ? ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING A LITTLE NUTS HERE NOW. THE DRUMS GO IN THE BACK, RORY. NOT NECESSARILY. RORY, NAME ONE BAND WHERE THE DRUMMER SITS UP FRONT, YOU CAN LEAVE IT THAT WAY. CONAN O'BRIEN.

MAKING MAJOR COMEBACK NEWS THIS WEEK ARE THE SUBURBANS... WITH THE RERELEASE OF THEIR 1981 HIT "BY MY SIDE." I CAUGHT UP HERE WITH THE BAND AT THE FUNKY NASSAU SOUL CLUB IN SKIMMERPOINT, LONG ISLAND, WHERE SONGWRITER AND KEYBOARDIST DANNY MORAN IS A PART OWNER. LET'S START BY TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OLD FOOTAGE WE'VE GOT HERE. THIS IS YOUR LAST INTERVIEW BACK IN 1981. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMPARISON TO THE BEATLES ? I MEAN, LIVING UP TO THAT ? I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE ONLY PUT OUT THE ONE RECORD SO FAR. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR EITHER, DICK. I THINK WE'RE BETTER THAN THE BEATLES. RIGHT, GIRLS ? [ Clark ] WELL, YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE GOING FOR YOURSELVES. NOW, WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE SUBURBANS ? I'M THINKIN' A SOUL RECORD. WHAT'S A SOUL RECORD ? WHAT WAS THE STORY ? WHY WAS THERE NO FOLLOW-UP TO YOUR FIRST ALBUM ? UH, WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, I-- I WANTED TO MAKE A SOUL RECORD. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE MITCH'S LEGAL PROBLEMS. I ALSO HAD SOME ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS THAT, UH, RELATED TO THE EXCESSES OF THE PERIOD... THAT I'M REALLY NOT COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING AT THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA LEVEL. NOW, UH, YOU MENTIONED MITCH'S LEGAL PROBLEMS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COPY OF THE INFAMOUS "MINI MART MOLESTER" TAPE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. ** [ Rock ] WOW. THAT MUST BRING BACK SOME MEMORIES, HUH ? NOW, RORY, I KNOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCED SOME VERY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL TIMES. IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG ROAD BACK, BUT I'VE LEARNED SOME REALLY VALUABLE LESSONS. GIL, I UNDERSTAND YOU ACTUALLY UNDERWENT TREATMENT FOR COMPULSIVE LYING ? WHAT ? THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN THE PRESS RELEASE. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT SAYS. I-I SWEAR I DIDN'T. YOU DIDN'T ? NO, I DIDN'T. OKAY, WELL, SORRY IF IT'S A PAINFUL SUBJECT. BUT- BUT I-- LET'S MOVE ON, I GUESS. WE'LL JUST MOVE ALONG. SO-- YOU KNOW, LET IT OUT. THAT'S THE BEST THING. LET IT ALL OUT.

MAYBE YOU WERE TRYING TO TELL ME THIS AND I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR. I WAS SO AFRAID THAT YOU DIDN'T WANNA... HAVE BABIES WITH ME AND GROW OLD WITH ME, THAT I JUST IMAGINED THAT YOU DID.

NO COMMUNICATION, RIGHT ? SO WE CAN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS. WHAT IF HE GETS OUT, HE FINDS OUT THE SHOW'S OFF... AND IT, LIKE, CRUSHES THE GUY AND IT SENDS HIM INTO ANOTHER TAILSPIN ? YEAH, BUT WHAT IF HE CAN'T, YOU KNOW, OR HE DOESN'T WANT TO ? I MEAN, THAT PUTS A LOT ON ME. THERE'S MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE. HE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT. TRUST ME.
