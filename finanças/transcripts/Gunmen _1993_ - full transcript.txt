Not here, please. Loomis is upset. He wants his money back. I told him, and I'm telling you, Karl and his men stole it. You know what I mean? Stole it. He took off. It was your responsibility. You've been loomis's banker for what, 20 years? You promised karl would ship the money safely out of the country. What happened? I don't know, armor. Why don't you ask karl? So, I should talk to karl? Yeah. Please do that. Talk to karl. Excuse me a minute. Karl. You know that was every penny that mr. Loomis had? I trust you. Where's the boat, karl? Karl? I don't think he's gonna answer me. He would've answered me, But maria here, being the bitch that she is, She cut his tongue before I had a chance to question him. And java over here, the motherfucker, he chopped his hands off. And then, the fucking guy dies on me. The tongue part was an accident. So, help me out here, guzman. I'm irish, maybe I'm thick. Karl takes off with a ton of cash And then, he comes back. Why? Probably, he come back for-for his brother. Karl has a brother. Yeah. And where can I find his brother? He's in macaibo prison. My brother karl paid you to break me out, right? He's rich, my brother, you know. I gotta go meet him as soon as possible, Help him spend all his money. You wanna come with me? So, what then? Why did you break me out? What the hell's the matter with you? Are you crazy? What are you trying to do, kill me? So, why did you break me out?
