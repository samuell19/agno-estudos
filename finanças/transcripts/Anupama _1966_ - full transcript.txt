Synced by Anomix33 Good afternoon. This is Eastern Exporters. Oh no, that's all right, Mr Sharma. One moment. You're giggling away! What's she saying? She has called him home. - Really? Give it to me I'll be there in half an hour. - No, sooner. In 20 minutes then? - No. 15 minutes. All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Do you think I like being away from you? Sometimes I feel like giving up everything to sit before you. To just keep looking at you. You're back, Mr Kashinath? - At the moment... the exporter's dealing only in love. - What does that mean? It's the telephone. By getting married at the age of 40... Mr Sharma has turned the office into a bridal party. Out of every hour, he spends two hours on the phone. Two hours in an hour? What arithmetic is that...? Moron! When could you ever use arithmetic in love? Does it appear from the boss's face that he could be such a romantic man? God! - What happened? Damn it! The line has gone dead. Sway gently... O yearning heart... he shall arrive. Do not torment me like this... he shall arrive soon. The air bears his scent. I can hear his footsteps. Let me dress up for him.. For he shall arrive soon. Sway gently... O yearning heart... he shall arrive. You're back. - Sing. Go & freshen up. Don't you remember? We're attending a party today. There's a lot of time for that. But a song mustn't remain incomplete. Please sing. I feel sad that I didn't learn to sing better. What you have learnt is enough for me. When a man gets more than he expects, he thinks he's not worthy of it. Where did you learn to talk like that? Where? Not even learnt... you stole them. From my poems. Sway gently... O yearning heart... he shall arrive. Do not torment me like this... he shall arrive soon. His shadows have begun to touch me. In the heart rings the bridal shehnai. In my heart sings love... for he shall arrive soon. Sway gently... O yearning heart... he shall arrive. I shall sulk and torment him. When he placates me, I will be placated. When can one help the feelings of the heart at a time like this...? He shall arrive soon. Sway gently... O yearning heart... he shall arrive. Do not torment me like this... he shall arrive soon. I'm ready. To eat? - Hush! Shameless! Listen... what if we don't go? What are you saying! If we don't go, we'll earn a bad name. What will they think? - At the most, they'll laugh at us. They'll tease that since we're newly married, we like being with each other. No, you'll have to come! Please hook my blouse. You should behave like you used to before marriage. How is that possible? - Why is it not possible? I'm hooked. Now I cannot be like I was before even if I want to. Earlier, I used to say that man makes the world go round. What have women got to do in it? And now? Now I think men are useless. Do you know, earlier, club and parties were my life. Now I fear crowds. Why? - I lose you in a crowd. I know! They are all excuses of your laziness. Now come like a good man. Come on! Yes, madam? - Here are the keys. Take care of the house. We'll be back late. And yes, shut the windows, it may rain. Alright. Let's go. Purse... handkerchief... goggles... pen... and cigarettes. Don't smoke more than four. Honestly Aruna, if it wasn't for you. Enough now! Go, or you'll get late for office. Listen... are you forgetting something? No. - Think again. Go... go! Hello, Sharma here. You...? - Didn't recognise me? I'm Shanta. Now please don't ask who Shanta. What are you talking! How can I forget you? I can see your image before my eyes. Only, your voice is a little thick. Probably been fighting with your husband all night. See! I am very fortunate. I am not married yet. I know now for sure that you haven't recognised me. I am Aruna's friend, Shanta. - Oh yes! Shanta. Tell me, what are you so proud of? Everyone gets married. And everyone becomes a father too. You are badly mistaken. Neither have I become proud, nor am I going to be a father. Trying to hide? - Not at all. You are shooting in the dark. Lay a bet. - You'll lose. No problem. Tell me, how much? - Whatever you say. Rs.100, Rs.200, Rs.1000. Then you have lost the bet. Come home quickly with the money. Aruna, listen! Sir, please excuse. It's a girl. - Girl! Sir! - What is it? It's a baby girl. Nurse, how is my wife? She's bleeding. I'm going to call the doctor. What happened, sir?...Sir! - Nothing. Sorry Mr.Sharma, I could not save her. Sir, the car is waiting. - Okay. Listen... Are you forgetting something? Sarla, why do you bring her before me? Is there no other place for her in the world? Sorry Mr.Sharma, I could not save her. Where is my daughter? ...Where is she? Why don't you speak? How are you at fault? Why do I hate you? It's my ill-fate. Uma dear! Where are you? ...Where are you, dear? Uma!...Where is Uma? Where are you, dear? Go to sleep now. Take... take it to him. Go... why are you afraid? If you still keep running away from your father, when will you get close to him? Take... take. He will gradually accept you. Go. What a destiny the poor girl is born with. Have you ever heard of a father who is not ready to look at his daughter's face unless he's drunk? You? Why did you bring this? Didn't your teacher come today? Then what are you doing here? Go and study. Where were you? Where is Govind? Tell me, in which year did the soldiers mutiny happen? Say something. ...Your silence beats me. You write so well. What happens to you while talking? At least tell me if a mutiny did take place or not. This is what happens with rich kids. Their parents spoil them silly. Sir, are you not feeling well? - Yes. Then go home. It's not a busy day today. I think I'll do just that. Why did you touch it? ..Why did you! Go away from here! Go away! Firstly, you will have to quit drinking. Secondly, you need to take a holiday. Where do I have the time to take a holiday? You will have to spare time. Don't worry doctor, I'll take him. Alright Mr.Suresh, he is your childhood friend. Take him somehow. It's your responsibility now. I'll be going, bye! I was going with my daughter to Mahableshwar anyway. Now you also come along, and take Uma too. Why did you knock and enter? Since when did you become so formal? That's not formal, it's normal. One must knock before entering someone's room. Who knows what you are doing inside? There could be a woman inside. Oh, I forgot! You are a widower. But widowers need more privacy. Right, Bakshi? Hey, I forgot! Even you are a widower. Strange! Anyone who comes to meet Sharma becomes a widower. Good I didn't get married. Anyway, how are you, Sharma? Damn it! He's made a mountain of a mole hill. Nonsense! I'm talking him to Mahableshwar. The doctor didn't ask him to quit smoking and drinking just like that. Wonderful! Do one thing. Send me all the bottles. You desire to live, I desire to die. Moses, don't talk of death now. Got scared? Your own death is a matter of fun. One doesn't know anything himself, and the others cry. That is why, I don't want to make you cry, but cry myself. We are your friends. How can we let you cry? Look, you are going to die soon. So make your Will. If you die before that, I'll lose my fees. Oh! I forgot to give you the important news. Your future son-in-law, and my landlord is returning from Europe next week. Who? - Hari Mehta's son, Arun. Has Uma's marriage been fixed with Arun? First consider who is saying this. Though Hari desired that his son marry my daughter. But Suresh, if Arun is returning, I just cannot come with you. No, you go, I'll send him to Mahableshwar. One who has traveled thousands of miles, won't he travel another 200? What I only fear is that he'll start pestering me for the rent. I'll give him rent, but only that can take him to Mahableshwar not bring him back. Moses, you also come along. - Mahableshwar? No! I have a sad memory connected with Mahableshwar. What memory? I'd fallen in love there. - Is it? When? In 1932. No, in that year, I fell in love with Rosy in Darjeeling. This was in 1931. When I stepped out of the hotel in Mahableshwar. I saw a beautiful girl standing near the mountain. At that time, the new fad was women wearing trousers. I saw her and fell for her. And started following her. Then what happened? - It is better if you don't ask. That girl turned out to be a boy. Everything seems new, doesn't it, Arun? Yes, I am returning after five years after all. Why didn't Ashok come? - I forgot to tell you. His mother is not keeping well. - What happened to her? It's nothing serious. Ashok has gone to collect the reports. He'll come. How is my tenant, Mr.Moses? Who are you looking for, uncle? - The madam. Madam? Yes. Didn't you bring along a madam from abroad? No. - Damn you! You have truly disappointed me. - Why? I thought you will come back and make me proud. But you didn't do a thing! Come inside. Uncle, why all this decoration? I thought, two of you will come. And become three before removing it all. Alright tell me, what feats did you accomplish there? - I wrote, I read. - And? I played cricket, tennis. - And? Traveled to other countries. - And? And nothing else. But uncle, it is necessary to marry a foreigner if you go abroad? Who spoke of your marriage? You'll bring the girl, I'd marry her. Great! He would spend her fare, and you would marry her? That's what happens. In 1936, when I brought Clara. No, in 1936, it was Polly. In 1939, when I brought Clara to India, I put her up in a good hotel. But the climate here didn't suit her. She caught a cold. Then?- I took her to Dr.Gomes. Why are you laughing, uncle? - What else can I do? Know what happened? Dr.Gomes married her, & I had to pay her hotel bills. Look, don't ask for the rent now that you have come. I'm broke. - What are you saying, uncle! In fact, I should be paying you. - Why? You looked after my house in my absence for so many years. Give me Rs.500. Alright, forget it. We are quits. Uncle Moses, we are planing to throw a grand party next Sunday. In honor of Arun's return. Not Sunday. He has to go to Mahableshwar. Mahableshwar? - Sharma is not keeping well. What happened to him? - Nothing to worry about. I have promised him I'll send you over as soon as you return. Then I will have to go. Uncle, you chat with them, I'll meet Ashok & come. Alright. What will you take? Gopal, get us whiskey. Who... who is it? ...Oh my God! Oh my God, it's you! Ma, come quickly! Look who's here. We were happy you were away for five years. But now you are back to trouble us. To trouble you and to listen to your abuses. Your abuses are better than staying abroad. Arun, you are back! Bless you, son! You have reduced. - Because I didn't have ma there. Now I'll put on again. Ma, you are still as beautiful. You still get dimples when you smile. Naughty! And you still express shyness the same way. I'm not talking to you. - Why? Why didn't you answer my last three letters? How could I? I learnt the alphabet 50 years ago. And forgot it all rearing up the children. It takes five days for the letter to reach you and it takes me seven days to write a letter. Tell me, how could I write? - You are forgiven! Tell me something, haven't you found a nut yet? Nut? For what? - For Gauri. I thought you must have got married by now, but you are still here. Look, I have bought you a beautiful gift. You'll get it when you get married. Now I won't give you anything on your marriage now. It's such a cheap watch. - It's cheap? Return it back to me. No, I don't want to hurt someone's feelings. You are forgiven. Ashok, leave... leave me! Have you stopped writing poetry? - Why? You have become so strong. I was very sad because you left, that's why I grew fat. So a person grows fat when he's sad? You have gone all around the world, but you are still an ass. Not as ass, an ass' friend. - I'll thrash you!..Sit down. So professor. - I have quit being a professor. I am a school teacher now. Why? They dismissed you from college? No, I was not dismissed, I quit the job. I wasn't comfortable there. There was no work, only money. Being a school teacher is better. All work, no pay. How much time you wasted. Look at the time! I know you got a watch as a gift. Go make tea for us. Right away! What's the problem with mother? Nothing serious, she had an infection. The doctor has advised change of weather. You know my financial state. Yet, a publisher has promised to give me money. The moment I get that money, I'll take ma to a hill station. Why don't you take her to Mahableshwar? And I cannot afford to take her so far. Stop joking. I am going to Mahableshwar. My uncle, Mr.Sharma is sick. I am going anyway to see him. You all also come along. As if that will not cost money. - Mr.Ashok! Who is it? Come inside. - Your money order. Money order! Where has it come from? ...Oh, the publisher has sent it. That's surprising! Gauri, the money has come, get ready to leave. You are going by car, isn't it? We'll travel with you. That will save my travel expenses. Have you counted it? - Yes. Has the money come? - Yes. Then shall I pack our bags? - Yes. Here's your pen. Keep it, I bought it for you. - For me? I'll begin my new story with it. Let's go up. Gauri, get the tea upstairs. Come! You are walking so slow. - I am tired. Mohan, what are you thinking? I was thinking that human mind is so strange. Look, it's such a beautiful place, there is so much peace here. On one hand, I feel like staying here. But when I think of work, I feel like going back right away. Why are you so obsessed with work? You can quit drinking in a day, can't you quit this obsession for work? There is nothing left in life. It is my work that helps me forget everything. Let's go back. This girl is mad, she'll even make me go mad. Look! She's riding a mad horse. Anyone around? ...Sit down. Get tea for him. Has Annie returned? - Yes. Don't talk to me! - Why? Why did you ride that horse? I'd forbidden you. You know that horse dropped a guy. He broke his bones. Leave me! I said leave me! I will not leave you. - Leave me, I'll fall. I won't. First say you're not angry with me. I'm not. Daddy, you have grown old! Me? I have grown old? I challenge you for an arm wrestle. Sharma uncle, you are the judge. The other hand behind you. Cheat! You used body weight. Right, uncle? An old man will support another old man. Just let Arun come! Oh yes! Arun is coming. Did you call the electrician? Did you get the switch in the guest room repaired? Why do we need an electrician? Arun is himself an engineer. Can't he repair a switch? He can do everything, but not repair your head! He will travel such a long distance and you expect him to repair switches here? What kind of a hostess are you? Daddy, if you scold me again, I'll... - What? I'll ride the horse again! - No! You are a good girl. Only your brain... no, it's better than any of us. Mohan, I hope you don't feel offended about all this. About what? - About Annie's behavior. Why? She has grown so big, but she still acts immature. Even she has the same fate as your daughter. She was a year old when she lost her mother. Since then, I have given her the love of a father and mother. Remove the luggage. - Gauri, get down. Ma, I'll just say hello to Sharma uncle and come back. Arun, I think you should stay with them. No. You stay out of this. - She is right. They may feel offended about your staying here. So let them. How can I stay with them when you are here? How can you suggest such a thing? - Put an end to this now. Arun, drop me off at the bazaar, I'm feeling very hungry. I'll pack something for them too. Take the bags. Keep this bag safely, all the money is in this. Let's go, Arun. Why are you staring like that? You have come to the right address. Don't recognise me? I'm Annie! You have grown so big! You were so little when I last saw you. Even you used to wear knickers then which kept dropping to your knees. And your nose kept leaking. Now don't talk too much, go inside, uncle Sharma is waiting for you. And give me the car keys, I'll take your luggage in. I left my luggage at Holiday Camp. - What do you mean? Actually, my friend, Ashok, and his mother and sister have come with me. They are staying at Holiday Camp. Even I am staying with them. What did you say? Say it again. My friend Ashok. His mother and sister have come with you. They are staying at Holiday Camp. Even you want to stay with them. Please go inside. I am a little hot headed. If I abuse you, you'll complain. It will be your fault, and I will earn ill-repute. Go inside, quick! I said go inside! Gopal, come with me. It's such a beautiful place. - Yes, but it's very cold. Why don't you wear a shawl? Where is it? In the bedding. I'm feeling dirty after the travel. If I could get hot water, I'd take a bath and feel fresh. Don't open it! Gopal, pick that bedding, I'll take the bag. And even this. I won't even let you touch it. You are Ashok's mother, aren't you? - Yes, do you know him? I've never met him. I've even heard his name for the first time. You want to ask how I know you are Ashok's mother. Common sense! Ashok is Arun's friend. Your age says you cannot be his sister nor can she be his mother. I don't like to talk too much. Let's go. But we don't know you. You will get to know me. One who is with me even for 1-2 hours, can never forget me. My name is Annie, my papa's name is Suresh Bakshi. And Bakshi Villa is named after him. If Arun wasn't stupid, he would have brought you straight over there. Anyway, forget what happened. Let's go. We don't mind coming, but Ashok has gone out. Let me ask him first. - What will you ask him? Nothing, but he's has his own ways. What if he doesn't agree? Aunty, I am a very nice girl. But if it comes down to fighting no one can defeat me. If he comes here and refuses, just think of the fireworks here. Will you like that? That's alright, but when brother returns. The watchman will tell him. Everyone here knows where our bungalow is. Aunty, our place is so huge, each person has three rooms. Please come! I took pains to make the guest rooms. Please come. Listen! Is this Bakshi Villa? - Yes. Is anyone in? - Yes, go inside. Excuse me. Hello. My name is Ashok. Did you bring my mother and sister here from Holiday Camp? You are Mr.Bakshi's daughter, aren't you? But this is Bakshi Villa, isn't it? Then. You are too much, Ashok! What took you so long? And what is this? You have even brought your ration along? It's like carrying your bed along when you go to someone's house. Now don't talk too much, go and take a wash. But you don't need to take a wash. Seeming you, I feel like taking a wash. Come, your sister and mom must be wondering where you are. Come! Stranger characters here. Why just a short story, even a novel can be written here. Ashok, get dressed soon, or the food will get cold, & Annie will get hot. Why do I have to get dressed? Let's go. But listen, Gauri. You are a guest of cultured people. Please show some table manners. You think I'm so stupid? - I didn't say SO stupid. Have we never been invited by a rich man? You have dinner everyday at home. At home, you lick your fingers. But over here, you'll have to sit on the chair and eat with fork and spoon. Will you be able to manage? - With knife and fork? Then you brother and sister better sit away from each other. Ma, she doesn't listen to me, you only make her understand. She has to behave well. Ma, even you are laughing? I'm not coming! Ma, why did you laugh? Come, Gauri. Come on, hurry! I'm feeling hungry. No, you didn't do the right thing. You shouldn't have taken up a job. You should have started some business. You had my support. You are right, but I couldn't muster courage to do business... because I didn't have experience. Who has experience in the beginning. You slowly gain experience. No one is born with it. Even I didn't have any experience when I started business. Perhaps that's why I succeeded. They have come! Please come. Ashok, sit here. Gauri, you sit here. He's Ashok, and she's his mother. And she's Gauri. Please sit down. - Ashok, he's my uncle. You know about him, and he is. I'm Bakshi. Mr.Bakshi, Ashok is a very good writer. His articles and short stories get published in India's leading magazines. - Great! How does he make a living? You are right. A writer has to have a job to make a living. One cannot survive by just writing. Only a few buy books to read them. All the others borrow. Do people even read in our country? Papa, everyone is talking, and I haven't spoken a word. And you say I talk too much. The talks are small, but when you speak them, they become too much. Papa! You are very bad. I won't dine with you, I'll dine with Uma. Uma come, I'll dine with you today. Annie... is she your younger sister? No aunty, she is Sharma uncle's daughter, Uma. I am elder to her by four years. But coincidentally, we were born on the same day. Is it? Come and dine with us. - No aunty, she is going to dine. But in another room. She doesn't eat in ether's presence. Why? - She's shy. Is it? Then I'll done with her. She won't feel shy with me, will she? If you people don't mind, I'll dine with Uma. Even I am not used to a table and chair. Come dear. ...You sit here! It's surprising, isn't it? Uma is growing old by the day. And you are becoming a child. Boy! serve us dinner. Did the heart say something? Nothing. Did the heart hear something? Nothing. There are such conversations too. Did the heart say something? The heart is feeling naughty. Someone make it see sense. Desires awaken. Someone may get defamed. On the bed of cold lids sleep the fairies of dreams. There are such conversations. To console the heart is fake shine, fake glamour. Though life remained meaningless everyone thought it was spring. Does anyone ask the buds whether they laugh or cry? There are such conversations. You wake up so early? The mornings are so beautiful. Everything seems bathed in milky coldness. And then slowly, everything wears a cloak of brightness. Isn't it? What are you hiding in your scarf? ...Flowers? Let me see. They are so beautiful. Shall I take a few? Uma, you came out without warm clothes? Hello. - Hello. Did Arun get up? No. Shall I send you tea? - If it isn't too much of a trouble. It's no trouble at all. Come Uma, wear your sweater. Arun! Don't drink tea. - What happened? I said don't drink tea! - But what is the matter? We are all going out today. We will eat and drink there. Get up! - When she asks you to get up you'll have to get up. Consider it army orders. Go. Let's go. He's a nice guy. Remember, even his father was like that. He's very jovial. I am sure Uma will be very happy with him. Arun, we'll have a great time today! For what? - For saving me from those old men. How dare you call my father old! - I was talking about Sharma uncle. Uncle Sharma? Shall I tell him? Come on! You take everything seriously. I was just joking. I understand. You are just like me. You never realise what you say. The only difference is that I talk too much. But rarely is it wrong. Even you talk, but it is rarely correct. Yet, I like you. You are so jovial. What are you waiting for? Go ask the others to get ready. Annie, if I tell Ashok, he may not. But if you tell him, he may. Alright, I'll convince them. Gauri, get up! - Ma, let me sleep. What a lazy girl you are! Look, your brother even took a walk. Ma, let her sleep. - Come on, get dressed! Gauri, you are still sleeping? Mr.Writer, enough writing. Get up. What is the matter? I have decided to have our breakfast outdoors. Why drag an old woman along? If you don't mind, excuse me. Aunty is old, so she won't come. You are young, so you won't come. Uma won't go because she's neither old, nor young. Gauri, even you find some excuse. Alright. Today's program is canceled! Why cancel? I will go alone. And will eat for all of you. Don't be angry, dear. Gauri, get dressed. Ashok, you too. Get ready soon, I am waiting for you. Ma, what did you get me into? Get up! What have you come here for? Not to sit indoors. Get in. Ashok, keep this inside. Gauri, did you take a mat? - Yes. And the basket. - I've kept it in the boot. Won't Uma come with us? - She doesn't go anywhere. At least try. - You didn't I didn't? The moment she heard picnic, she broke into cold sweats. I was worried she'll faint. That's how shy she is. That is why we should take her along. Our company is a must for her. Forget it. Why trouble yourself over something that's not possible? Let's go. Why didn't you go with them? Why can't you be merry like them? Why are you always lost in yourself? You don't like this noise, this crowd, right? Even I don't like it. Let's go back today itself. The wet weather. It makes my heart go wild. It makes the tresses fly. And steals the fragrance from flowers. The crazy, naughty wind! The wet weather. The bird sings in the jungle and thrills every nerve. Like someone naughty secretly lifts the veil. No one came, no one who I liked. So my shadow walked along with me. The wet weather. A whiff of wind blows every moment. And blows away my scarf. My heart, my soul, my life, sing softly. My heart has bloomed. A pain sears my heart. The wet weather Madam... - Who is it? Uma, you! Come dear. Come, sit down. Madam, a telegram has come. Mr.Sharma will have to leave today itself. And you two? - Even we will have to leave. But I have not even been able to talk to you. Madam, have breakfast. I don't eat anything in the mornings. Nothing at all? - No. Eat something. I'll have to eat if you tell me. This is surprising, madam. She doesn't even talk to anyone. I know why she doesn't talk. If she talks, flowers will fall. And if she smiles, pearls will fall. Don't drag me. Ma, it was such fun. It would be nice if you had come along. Yes, you'd see what a good sense of humor she has. I can't be serious like you every time. Ma, they are so rich, but not at all proud. They are very nice people. Gauri, never form an opinion about someone so soon. Why, can't rich people be good? Some good men do become rich. But it's very difficult to stay good after becoming rich. I am waiting for the day when you will become rich. That's impossible. Why? It's possible some film producer buys one of your novel some day. That day will indeed be very unfortunate for him. But Gauri, I have thought of a wonderful plot. I forgot to tell you. Sharma left for home. Suddenly? - Yes, he received a telegram. I could not even meet her. - Yes, she was such a sweet girl. I'd begun to like her very much. Wonder when she'll meet us again. Ma, you had gone outside? - No. Then who brought these flowers? - Uma gave them before she left. So you want a divorce, Mr.Clairiat? - Yes. Do you know what divorce means? - Yes, leaving one's wife. Reason? - Marriage. Why did you get married? - I didn't, she married me. She was after me, I could not refuse. Why? - You are old, you won't understand. I understand! Love marriage? Seeing my face, you don't believe it? No one does. Even I don't. How many years have you been married? - Five years. Why do you want to break this relationship of five years in a day? She always taunts me about my face. Before marriage, she used to say my face is like the moon. And now You only find some solution. Help me get out of this daily tension. Because of the fight, did she ever stop looking after you? No, never. Did she ever not take care of you when you were ill? She did. Who cooks food? - She does. Did you ever have to go hungry after the fight? No. - Then why have you come here? Send her, I'll fight the case on her behalf. Then what about me? - You'll have to pay her alimony. Damn! I only make Rs.400 a month. How will I survive? Shall I tell you? - Yes. Go home. And behave the way you used to with your wife earlier. The woman who loved a man like you, married you looked after you, fed you... Remember, she still loves you. Mr.Clairiat, you cannot clap with one hand. Go home, everything will be alright. Will it? - Believe me everything will be alright May I leave? - Yes. How good a cook is your wife? - Very good. Her Biryani Enough! The day you stop fighting, invite me to taste her Biryani. That will be my fees. - Sure. No! Is this true or am I dreaming? Annie in a saree!! Wait! Let me confirm. I know! You want to pinch me with that excuse. Alright, but don't pinch too hard. How do I look in a saree? Has this change come about only on the outside, or within too? Why? - Because you are talking to me but looking up. Arun and I had decided to go marketing. I came a little early. It's not your fault. The watches nowadays run very slow. Uncle, are these flowers from your garden? The garden belongs to someone else; the flowers are mine. Flowers belong to those who like flowers. Can I take one? Let someone else wear a flower in your beautiful tresses. Not on my behalf, on Arun's behalf. Happy now? That fool will come, and leave without understanding the relation... between tresses and flowers. Uncle, you are so nice. You are not only daddy's, but my friend too. But uncle, why are they not like you? They have all turned old and senile. I am still young. Uncle, remember what it is next Friday? Your birthday, right? I'll surely come. And bring along a huge bouquet. If anyone comes between you and me, I'll get into a duel with him. What is the mater, uncle? - There he comes! What happened? Why are you laughing? Nothing happened. And it cannot either. I am laughing because I cannot cry. You are getting late, aren't you? Go. Synced by Anomix33 You! - What are you doing? Batik. - You make it yourself? It's very easy. - Teach me too. I may look stupid, but I am very smart. Who are you talking to, Gauri? Oh, it's you! Aunty, Gauri is so nice, so smart. Why can't I be so nice? There is no one more nicer than you, dear. May you always be like this. I had some important work with you. Tell me. - I forgot what it was. Arun, why had I come here? - Your birthday. Keep quiet! Aunty, I'm celebrating my birthday day after tomorrow. And bring along Ashok and Gauri. Tell Gauri personally, or she won't come. Gauri, do come. - I would surely come, but But what? - I teach in a school in the evenings. You know I already took such a long holiday. So I won't be able to make it. - Offended? - How can I be? I have to learn Batik from you. Aunty, when will Ashok come? Ask him to attend the party definitely. Yes, he will surely come, even if he is busy. What if he is very busy? - Even then he will come. That's good. I'll be going now, I have to invite many other people. Bye, Gauri. - Bye ma, bye Gauri. They are such nice people. - Yes, ma. Ma, some day, we must visit Uma's home. Yes, though we were together only for a few days, I cannot forget her. I have even asked Ashok to look them up. You think he will ever visit a rich person's home? When did you return? - 4-5 days ago. Gauri, your mother, how is everybody? They are fine. Mother wanted me to look you up as soon as we were back. How is Mr.Sharma? - He has gone to Delhi. Be seated, I'll be back. Hello. Mother has sent me to look you up. And I have come to thank you. I got those flowers you left. I hope you are fine. I had come to inquire about you, which I have. May I leave now. I can stay if you like. I'm going. - No, please stay. Thank you God! You at least spoke something. Or I had decided that if you don't speak to me today I'll never step into this house again. Will you stand there? Please come and sit here. Tell me, why don't you speak? ..Sit down. I don't need to tell you this, but your eyes say everything. So much only for me? I am a good eater, specially where sweets are concerned. But I am embarrassed. I'll get one more plate. Take, one more plate is coming. I have just eaten. - Even I have just eaten. Look Uma, better eat, or else or I'll finish it alone. Uma, I think you have never seen yourself smile. Some day, go and smile into the mirror. You'll know how beautiful your smile is... how sweet. 'Uma, I think you have never seen yourself smile.' 'Some day, go and smile into the mirror.' 'You'll know how beautiful your smile is.' What is this? You are still writing? Looks like you have been awake all night. Yes Gauri, I was awake all night. Gauri, my novel is going great. Wish we could take our characters, our thoughts from real life, instead of imagining them. It would be so nice. It's Annie's birthday day after. She liked Batik very much. Shall I make a piece of Batik for her? Yes, sure. - But it's such a cheap thing. And they are so rich. Come on! They should see the feeling behind the gift, not it's price. Alright, I'll make two pieces. One for Annie, and another for Uma. For Uma? Yes, it's Uma's birthday too on the same day. Remember, Annie had told us. Oh yes! But Uma won't attend the party. So what? Go and give it to her at home. Get up. Take a wash. Your tea is getting cold. I'll tell you another funny incident. One day, a Mr.Rai came to my house. He said, 'Lawyer, please save me' I asked him what the matter was. He said his neighbour had accused he had abused him. So the neighbour had dragged him to court. I told him I'll save him. That he must not speak in court. He must act dumb. He stood in court. Mr.Rai didn't answer any question the prosecutor asked him. I told the judge how could Rai have abused when he cannot speak. The judge acquitted him. Mr.Rai was happy, I was happy. I congratulated Mr.Rai and asked him for my fees. Do you know what fees he gave me? - What? They've come! I know who that is. See! Every girl recognizes my whistle. Bless you. May you get all happiness in life. And leave all sorrows for me. May you laugh. May you always laugh. Yes Moses, that's the blessing she needs. You old man! What are you doing among youngsters? And what are you doing? You are comparing yourself with me? I am the apple of everyone's eye, and you are an irritation. Scram! Okay baba (old man)! - Hey! Who are you calling baba? Call me young man. - Alright! Young man. Why are you so late? You invited me at 7:30, and it's 7:30 now. Take. Where is Ashok? Hello Uma. - Hello. Feeding the fishes? They are your good friends, they don't trouble you. Neither do they speak, nor force you to speak. I have brought something for you. Close your eyes. Come on! Now extend your hand. Gauri has herself made it for you. - Herself? Yes, as a gift on your birthday. What happened? ...What happened, Uma? Nothing... nothing. What happened, dear? - I don't know, she suddenly left. Gauri had sent her a gift on her birthday. Oh, birthday. How can her birthday be a happy occasion for her? She lost her mother on the day she was born. That is why she blames herself. She is punishing herself for that crime. Where must she have gone now? Where can she go? She must be sitting in the garden and crying. Can I go there? - Yes. When I go home, ma and Gauri will ask me what you thought of the birthday gift. What will I tell them? I cannot lie and I don't have the courage to speak the truth. I had come here with joy. Had I known my coming here will hurt you, I'd never have come. You are not at fault. If I was at fault, it would be different. Being blamed despite being innocent But one thing is true. Neither would I come to wish you, nor would you get hurt. But now I will have to go and tell Ma and Gauri that I made Uma cry. Then look here, towards me. Smile. Let me at least take something for mom and Gauri. Smile. Why did you give me so much happiness that my heart fears? I may get carried away, I may slip Why did you give me so much happiness that my heart fears? I have so much to choose from. I disgrace myself today. My heart skips a beat. If I begin to feel proud. Why did you give me so much happiness that my heart fears? I feel flushed seeing my glowing face. I may jinx myself. This is a time when you fall in love with yourself. Why did you give me so much happiness that my heart fears? Life is desperate for me. Love is a beautiful dream for me. Wonder why everyone gets carried away when my heart gets carried away. Why did you give me so much happiness that my heart fears? Come to my house some day. I'll show you a sight. There is a colony of poor people near our home. And we can see everything they do from our balcony. I always wonder how they must be surviving with so many sorrows and troubles. Not just living, they sometimes even manage to rejoice so much it surprises me. Now I think, is it because they are used to sorrow? Sorrow is no more sorrow for them. But that's not the reason of their craziness. They have a strange force of life. Hard work, hard work, and more hard work. They don't get anything easily. So a little happiness that comes their way they want to enjoy it to the fullest. You have got a lot in life. Haven't you? And even if you haven't, so what? You don't get everything in life. Look at your father, What does he lack? He has money, respect, status. But a wife. Sorry, I started that topic again. Even I cannot forget it. I am not asking you to forget it. But just think. The sorrow of your father. You must always be happy, so that your father. No... I love him very much. That's true. You don't even like to look at anyone else. I'm stating a fact. I gave such a big lecture. I came to wish you on your birthday but you didn't even offer me a piece of sweet. I'll get it. - Sit down, I was just joking. I look calm and serene, but I am very naughty. Tell me what is wrong with this couplet. Which couplet? Let's talk of the beauty of my beloved. Let's talk of tresses, of beautiful faces. Tell me. You are all educated. It's perfect, there is nothing wrong with it. Perfect? Nonsense! You would know if you had loved. 'Talking' is wrong here. Which means, you are in love, & still only talking? Uncle, if Ashok was here, he'd give you an answer. Even Ashok, the great, would not have been able to give an answer. Alright tell me, seeing a full moon, why did the poet say 'l moon, hide behind clouds“ 'Why do you make me jealous?' 'When the whole world is hungry' 'You remind me of food' Wonderful! Why are you so late? - I'm sorry. Gauri has sent this for you. Gauri has sent this. What have you brought for me? I... I have brought you my best wishes. Just best wishes won't do. You'll have to recite a poem for me. Look, I am a poet who writes only tragic poems. My poetry won't befit this happy occasion. Don't make us understand. As it is, we are very knowledgeable. Begin. - Yes, come on! Uncle, I'll make the lights dim for effect. Either hear what my heart says or let me keep quiet. How can I call sorrow, happiness? Those who do, let them. Either hear what my heart says or let me keep quiet. What flower has bloomed in the garden? The gardener does not love it. I laughed off everything. Now, if my eyes shed tears, let them. Either hear what my heart says. I have not seen a single happy dream. Even if I have, I've forgotten it. You could not give what I wanted. Let me bear what you have given me. Either hear what my heart says. No one can share someone's sorrow. No one has so much feeling. Let the flowing tears, flow. Don't give me that sympathy. Either hear what my heart says or let me keep quiet. Hello. How are you feeling now? Hello uncle. - Sit down, dear. I'm fine. You... - We have come to invite you. We are having a prayer session day after. You and Uma must come. Me? - It's Sunday, a holiday. Please don't mind, but I won't be able to come. Uma will surely come. Alright. Gauri will come and take Uma. Boy! Ask the driver to drop them home. Why do you bother? - It's no bother. The driver will know where you stay, so Uma can come on her own. Good day. Madam... - Brought the leaves? Keep them there. Sit down, I'll just come. What is it? - He's brought banana leaves. Pay him. What all do you want me to do? Do I give tea to Ashok, or give him money? Give him the money. - Uma, go upstairs & give Ashok tea. Must you ask her to do things? So what? ...Go give him tea and come. Uma hasn't come yet, Gauri? Tell me as soon as she comes. You? When did you come? They are making you do chores. Please sit down. Won't you attend the prayer session? I am praying. I think, working with dedication, loving and respecting everyone that itself is the greatest worship. But that doesn't mean I am against praying. We are having prayers, that's why you came. Do you pray'? What do you ask from God? I forgot! You don't tell what you ask from God. And then, girls even hide what's on their mind from God. Isn't it? Even I sometimes feel like asking something from God. But when God Himself is showering all the world's beauty on me without asking, & trying to provide me with everything, why should I ask? Don't you think so? Sarla says God doesn't give happiness to everyone. Don't say that. Don't blame God. It is we who create woes for ourselves. Agreed there are reasons but why are you standing? Sit down. What were you writing? A story. A story of a girl like you. She thought people misunderstood her. Even she didn't understand others. She only understood the language of flowers and birds. But she was very uncomfortable in the world of humans. She never realized that the real block was not outside, but within her. Within her mind. She kept a distance from people. Even people got distanced from her. And then one day, it so happened What happened? I was going to write that when you came. No... no! I don't want to hear anything. You are a coward. You can love, but cannot say even this. Please Annie, how can I just say it? Alright, don't. You keep pondering, I'm leaving. What if I ask Uncle Moses to tell him? Who is getting married? You, or Uncle Moses? I, but at least let's take his advice. Alright, come. Come dear. - We want an advice from you. If it's legal advice, you'll have to pay fees. If it's not legal advice, you'll have to pay more fees. Oh uncle, don't joke. - We are so nervous, and... What is the matter? People rise in love, not fall in love. Some say they are arrested in love. Is love the police that it can arrest you? Some say a girl has made them die. Instead, they must say, a girl has made them come alive. We are moving away from the issue. Is there an issue greater than love? There is. Uncle Sharma had called me yesterday. You think he must get married? - Yes. To the one who he doesn't even love? Just because his father Never! The one he loves... he must marry her. I am not saying he must marry me. Whether he marries me or not is not the question. The question is how can he love one and marry another? Won't that ruin both their lives? Uma is such a nice girl, so innocent. Would it be right to cheat her? You are right. - But uncle... Arun, I can understand the fix you are in. But just think. To avoid a little pain today if you take a wrong decision it is possible everyone may have to bear much more pain in the future. I won't marry anyone except Annie. But the problem is, how do I tell Sharma uncle? You tell him, uncle. - No son. You must face this yourself. Anyone else telling him will hurt him terribly. I know him. You must go. You have loved, not committed a sin. What will happen at the most? He will slap you. Accept it. One has to bear a lot for love. Even you want that, uncle? What is it, Arun? - Send Ashok. He's not home. - Damn! What happened? - I wanted to take advice from Ashok. Take it from me. There is nothing more cheaper than advice. Keep your advice with yourself, or give it in school. You haven't gone to school today? - I quit my job. Why? - We are leaving for the village. What for? - I'll teach in a school there. And even Ashok may join us later. Arun! when did you come? Ma, why this sudden decision to live in the village? Ashok quit his job. - Why? It was difficult to survive. But don't worry, this decision is in our interest. Ashok will stay here. If he doesn't get another job even he will join us in the village. He will teach in a school there. If you all leave, even I'll join you in the village. I have no one here to understand my problems. What problem? - Nothing, just tell Ashok I'd come. Tell me about it. - It's nothing. Really? - Yes, it's nothing. What is the matter, Arun? - It's nothing. There is something which you aren't telling me. It's nothing. Tell Ashok I'd come. I'll come again. Alright. Arun, you? When did you come? Just now. - You should have come upstairs. Why did you stay here? Don't you consider this your home? Sit down. What is it? I am in a dilemma. What dilemma? I want to talk to you, but it's a delicate matter. Why are you so scared? - I'm not scared. Are you busy? - I am, but not for you. What is it, tell me. Mr.Bakshi... l... - What about Mr.Bakshi? No... we had met that guy in his house in Mahableshwarm... Ashok... What happened to him? - He lost his job. The poor guy has to send his mother and sister to the village. I was wondering if - Is that all? Yes. - Send him to me, I'll do the rest. Where are you going right now? - I don't know. Don't know? - I do. Shall I drop you somewhere? - No, I've brought my car. I'm leaving. What are you writing, Gauri? - Arun just left. He has come twice since morning for you. Why, what is the matter? - I don't know. He said Mr.Sharma has called you home, he has urgent work with you. Mr.Sharma has called me? Gauri, I really don't like Mr.Sharma. I think you must go, Arun looked very upset. Is it? Then I'll have to go. Since you are going there, ask Uma to come and meet us. Wonder when we'll meet again. - Can't you call her up? I'm not telling her anything. Ma wants to meet you before we leave for the village. We would come, but the buses are so crowded. You have a car, why don't you come? Will you come? I'm sure you are nodding. How will I see that over the telephone? Tell me, will you come? - I will. Your father has called Ashok over to your house. Do you know why? Nodding your head again? - I don't know. Come soon. I'll disconnect. Take, drink. - I don't want it. Why are you upset now? You have sent daddy to meet Uncle Sharma. I saw what you could do. You are such a chatter box! I don't know what to do. What a dilemma! ...You say suggest something. Why should I? I am a chatter box. Annie, try to understand. Your problem is my problem. But what is the problem? I'd gone to meet Uncle Sharma to talk about us. But told him instead to help Ashok get a job. He told me to send him. I told Gauri to tell Ashok Uncle Sharma has called him. You did the right thing. - Nonsense. You don't know Ashok. He is a complicated man. Then go and tell him not to go. - I went twice, but didn't meet him. If he goes to meet Uncle Sharma, I've had it. Who is it? - Hello. It's you. - You wanted to meet me. Me?...Oh yes! But why did you come here? You should have come to my office. Anyway, now that you are here, sit down. How much salary do you expect? How many years since you passed your Masters? Six years. Do you have any experience? - No, I teach. That's the most easiest job. Anyway, I'll speak to Mr.Robinson of National Builders. A job will be arranged for you. Remember, a job means to keep your seniors happy. Then even if you have to flatter them. The guys nowadays have airs. They leave their self respect behind. Or you know there are so many graduates and double graduates who are jobless. You have called me here to give me a job? But who told you I want a job? Arun did. - Arun? He told you I want a job? Yes. Aren't you jobless? - There are many who are jobless. Will you give jobs to all of them? Everyone cannot come to me. It's just that you You are taking pity on me? Why do you think whoever comes to you is begging for your kindness? I have to think, when I hear someone committed suicide for not having a job That someone was thrown out of the house for not paying rent. Or that he had to send his mother and sister to the village. And you feel pity for them. We may be poor, Mr.Sharma. We may even have several needs. But you don't know that love and sacrifice eliminates all those lacking. We only don't have money, but everything else. What do you want to say? That you poor people have only money, nothing else. Look at yourself, at your daughter. And decide for yourself whether you should take pity on someone else or yourself. I didn't call you here to advice me in my home. I'm sorry for having hurt your feelings, Mr.Sharma. Where my feelings are concerned. Forget it. Do come to my house one day. And see for yourself whether you need me or I need you. Good day. Come. How are you? - I'm fine. Sit down. What is the matter? I've come to discuss a delicate matter. I don't know how to begin. - Please tell me. Arun's father wanted Arun to marry your daughter. But Arun wants to marry Annie. In fact, he has even proposed her. Alright, if he wants to marry Annie, who can stop him. But Uma - You don't have to pity Uma. I wanted to keep my promise, or there is no dearth of boys for my daughter. Sitaram had asked for her hand for his son a few days ago. Good! A big burden is off my heart. And my heart too. Instead, I am grateful to you. Because Arun is not all that Anyway, you fix this alliance without hesitation. Is Mr.Sitaram in? ...he's gone out? I'll call later. Sharma here. Where are you two going? Have you lost your tongue? Why don't you answer? We are going to Ashok's house. - Ashok's house? His mother and sister are going to the village, so Let them go to hell! What have you got to do? Go upstairs! Sarla, I don't want Uma to be friendly with any Tom Dick Harry. Is that clear? Ashok! - Come in. I have come already... What is this you have done to yourself? You are running a temperature! - I was, it's comes down now. Why didn't you inform us? You could have come to look me up. You are right. But Arun is so busy with his work. And I... - You are busy shopping. When will the D-day come? - D-day? What D-day? Your marriage. - Marriage? Seeing your state, I feel like marrying today, now itself! Then at least Ma and Gauri will come, & we won't have to see you like this. Did you take medicine? Why should I take medicine for fever? And food? - My neighbours send it. If that's the case, why don't you go and stay there? Because if I go there, who will send me food from here? Anita, Arun will be very happy marrying you. You are one in a million. You have a clear heart. Don't tell Arun this, or he'll say, I don't have anything in my heart nor my head. Anita, my novel just got published. Here's my first copy for you. Wow! 'Anupama'. Who is Anupama? My imagination. Only imagination? - Yes. Is it? This is your copy. Uma, you are my Anupama. Ashok. Ashok, you are a writer. You can express your feelings. But you cannot hide them. I may sing, dance, prance around, but don't forget a woman's heart beats within me. I'll be back. If Arun comes, ask him to wait. But where are you going? - To get your medicine. I don't need medicine. Come... come on! You've brought the doctor along? Yes, a doctor, whose medicine can never fail. Doctor, will you stay out? Please come in... come. Ashok, Uma can stand. But you are sick, you should take rest. Come Uma, sit down. What are you waiting for? Don't we have to get medicines? Yes, but which medicine? My great grandfather was a doctor. I know all medicines. Let's go. Uma, you chat with Ashok. I'll come and pick you up later. Sit down. Since when have you been sick? - Since 3-4 days. You must have been in pain. No, not really. The novel I was writing that day, has got published. Here's your copy. 'Anupama' What a nice name. Do you know the meaning of 'Anupama'? One who is unique. Incomparable! Yes. But for me, 'Anupama' is you. Yes Uma, you are my Anupama. Whatever I saw you going through, I merged it with my imagination and wrote this novel. If my imagination and your life are same I will consider my effort worthwhile. Sarla, a prospective groom's family is coming to see Uma. Make arrangements for their welcome. And ask Uma to get dressed. But - But what? Uma has gone out today. What! Uma has gone out? Annie took her along. Annie? - Yes. She'll be back soon. Any letter from Gauri or Ma? Yes, I received one letter. About me - Yes, they enquired about you. They had waited for you before leaving for the village. Even I hoped to meet them. I see a lot of change in the Uma of then and now. What change? - That you hope for something. Hoping is beautiful. Hoping is life. You were asking what happened next in the story. Since that day, there was a change in Uma. The seed of hope burst, and a leaf emerged then another, and another, and a plant grew. Then? - The plant grew, flowers bloomed. Then... - Annie has come! I'll go home now. Please sit, I'll come again. Don't you dare step out of the house again without my permission. Go upstairs! Hello, Mr.Sitaram. Are you coming in the evening? No, it's not that. Actually, my health is deteriorating by the day. So I want the marriage date fixed at the earliest. What?...yes... good day. Who is it? - Ashok here. Oh, Ashok. Yes, tell me. Can I speak to Uma? - Yes. You are not keeping well. Why did you come out? I could not hold myself back. I'm calling from a neighbor's place. Look, I must tell you this today. What? I just want to tell you to consider us your family. Consider our home your home. You have full right over us. If we can do anything for you we, Gauri, Ma, me, will consider it an honor. Will you remember? What happened, Uma? What happened? I'm Sarla. - Is Uma crying? Yes. But why? - Can I come and meet her today? No, some people are coming to see Uma. Come dear, sit down. Sharma insisted, that's why we had to give you trouble. Or there was no need to see you. What is your name? - Uma. Wow! You are as beautiful as your name. You are right. She's a very nice girl, in looks, and talent. I didn't get married. I don't regret that. What I regret is that if I'd got married, even I'd have a daughter like Uma. That's why I sometimes think I'll get married. Then is the 6th confirmed? - Yes. Now we are more desperate to take her home. The sooner good things are done, the better. Mohan, the dinner arrangements should be excellent. Biryani, pulao! I'll eat so much What will happen now, Ashok? I know the boy who Uma is being married to. Uma will never be happy with him. We must do something. - But what can we do? You can do everything. Why don't you pull Uma out of that hell? That will be wrong in principle. - What principle? I know very well Uma loves you, and you love Uma. Your going to the village is just an excuse. Why don't you say you are trying to run away from here? That you are trying to shirk your responsibility. I didn't know you were such a coward. Anita, I am not a coward. But I don't want to impose my views, my principles on her like her father, and make her a mental invalid. Like millions of parents have done in this country with their children. A person's freedom is as important as a country's freedom. And this freedom has to be gained with one's own effort. All those are bookish talks. No Anita, these are not bookish talks. I had told Uma my doors are always open for her. It's her job to walk up to my home now. Pardon me Ashok, I am naive. But I know that some people can walk on their own. While some need help. But you won't understand this, because you are a man. You think with your brain. Alright, do nothing, and let her die a torturous death. Where is Uma? - In her room. Uma, Ashok is leaving tomorrow by the 10 am train. He may never return. I don't have to tell you why he is leaving That day, when you heard he is sick, and came along with me I knew your feelings for him, and his for you. Don't let this happen, you'll ruin yourself. Leave everything. Break these fake bonds. Even the whole world is no compensation for love. What are you afraid of? You are so fortunate. You gave love, you got love in return. Don't let it go just like that. Uma, you can ruin your life, but have no right to ruin Ashok's life. When the heart breaks, there is no sound. If you reject his love, even God won't accept you. I cannot say any more. Come with me... come. Oh. I thought you were soft hearted. But now I know you don't have a heart. We were mistaken, even Ashok was mistaken. He simply wrote a book, and dedicated it to you. You! Who shattered all his dreams, his hopes. Anupama only understood the language of flowers and birds. But she was very uncomfortable in the world of humans. She never realized that the real block was not outside, but within her. Within her mind. Anupama never left that world of shadows. Gradually, she had neither expected, nor felt dejected. One day, a stranger came into Anupama's life. What knocked her doors with its lashes, was love. Then, a question kept hovering in her mind. Anupama, why are you hesitant? What dilemma is this? You rule your heart, you can do as you please. And then came a day, when Anupama came out of the web she had spun herself. She saw the morning sun waiting to welcome her with open arms. Only one voice echoed in her heart, 'I will go!' Keep it here. The token of acceptance has come, go and accept it. What happened? - Sir, return it all. What do you mean? - This is not a token it is the message of death for Uma. I cannot see my daughter being sacrificed right before my eyes. What nonsense are you talking! - I am stating a fact. Uma is not only your daughter, she is my daughter too. I may not have sired her, but I have reared her. I have seen her grow up everyday. I know what she desires, what she craves. Stop that nonsense! Is this a joke? Her token of marriage has come, so many guests are expected. I cannot see her being murdered like that. If you cannot bear it? Get out of here! I will go away. I am a servant after all. If your wife was alive, would she allow this marriage? No, she would never allow her Uma's life to be ruined like that. Father... - Do even you want to say something? No father, I have come to take your blessing. I am leaving this home forever. As soon as I came into this world, I snatched what was most dearest to you. Wonder what place mom must have created for herself in your heart that seeing me, you are reminded of her. Maybe that is why you never forgave me. Bless me to make the same place for myself in someone's heart that mom had made for herself in your heart. You are blessing me, father. Shall I go? Father, I know how lonely you are. I will come whenever you call me. The token has come? Where is Mohan? Upstairs. Uma, what happened, dear? I am leaving, uncle. Leaving? What is the matter? Nothing. - There is something. I am like your father. Tell me. I am going forever. - What!! Have you gone crazy? The guests have arrived. - Let me go, uncle. No! Be sensible. What behavior is this? Have you given a thought of what will become of your father? He will not be able to face anyone. His honor will be disgraced. - Let me go, uncle. No, I won't let you go. Let her go, Moses. Have you come to meet Ashok? He has left for the station. Sarla, go home. Father has no one in the world. Come quickly. - I won't go back home, uncle. I have not come to take you back home. Hurry! or we'll be late. The train is about to leave. You also go. Truly speaking, I don't like this 'see-off' ritual. Anita, don't be sad, life is like that. Ashok, don't give me those high funda talks. If this is life, why live at all? I don't believe in these things. I... Ashok, look! You had said that whenever I want... Yes Uma... come.
