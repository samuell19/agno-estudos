HARMONIA "Sarah, Abraham's wife, had no children, and she had an Egyptian maid, Hagar." Genesis chp. 16 Thank you. Alex. What? Applicant number seven, Hagar. Hagar. We are sitting in the fifth row, and there are another 17 rows behind us. Would you like to start over? Thank you. Why is it so hard for you to decide? She has got a sound. So what? Even a nice sound is lost when one plays the horn like a violin. Third horn must know how to project emotion, not swallow it. Number 6 played with the Vladivostok Philharmonic for 15 years. He comes highly recommended, his playing was very accurate. Loud. Boring. We have to make a decision by tomorrow. "Do to her as it pleases you." Genesis chp. 16 I would like you to... find out a couple of things about her. Gently, no drama. - Maestro. - Yes? - Have you heard about Lorin Maazel? - I have. Have you met? This is Alex, our brilliant photographer. Alex... one more for the history books. Welcome. I'm Leonid. It's nice to meet you. Your playing isn't very typical of the academy. I guess I don't know a thing about auditions, only 17 years in the orchestra. Don't mind him. His bark is worse than his bite. Let's go, everyone. Rehearsal starts in two minutes. This way. Hagar. Were you looking at my players? Did you see their faces? Have you noticed anything unusual? Have you seen how many eyes they have? One for the music notes, one for the first chair, and two for me. Come on, let's do it again. Eight bars back. Eight bars back. Let's start over. What are you writing? This is for the baby. You'll bring bad luck. Come on. This way. - Yeah, I was there. I know him. - Come on. Perfect. From now on, it's all yours. I wouldn't try him again. At least he has nice eyes. Excuse me. I'm sorry, where is the exit? Let me show you. We didn't come in this way. Have you eaten today? I'm not hungry. Where are you taking me? Something smells great. Are you afraid of me? No. So what's your problem? Do you know what I wonder? I wonder... what is it that I can't see. What can't I see about you, that she does? Have you had anything to drink today? Yes, "Daddy." I have. Switzerland. A sanatorium by the lake. Just don't touch the record player. Pyotr stayed there for a whole year... after trying to commit suicide over an unfulfilled love for a man... and then he wrote Swan Lake. He would die for Tchaikovsky. He bought it for me in India during a tour with the orchestra. He wanted to boost my ego. They purr when you pet them. I had a hard time with him at first, too. I never wore this here. Would you like to pet it? Come on. Come on. - Is this made from a real leopard? - Five of them. A different leopard for each side. The third one is on the back. - Does it feel nice? - Very. Do you want to try it on? It'll probably look huge on me. I'm eleven weeks pregnant. Am I showing? Wow. I'm so happy for you. Is it a boy or a girl? We can't tell yet. I should have had eight of them by now. Right, Doctor? We haven't had much luck until now. That's his heart. Hey... wake up. Hold her. I'm calling Dr. Levin. His phone is off, damn it. I'll get a towel and we will go down to the car. How many times have they told you that we need to keep calm and stay put? There's so much blood. I'm going to the bathroom. This has happened before. Stay with her for a while, make sure she's all right? We will take better care of you next time. There won't be a next time. What time is it? Set her up in the guest room. Make up the bed for her. It's all right, I can call a cab. "I may obtain my wish by her." Genesis chp. 16 I would like to thank you for the opportunity, but I don't think I'm right for your orchestra. That's right, you're not. I can't play the way you want me to. How do I want you to play? Louder. More obediently. Like the rest of them. I'm sorry to ask this way, but... after last night, I feel as though we are family. What's your story? I'm sorry, I haven't told you the whole truth. I never graduated from the academy. Disciplinary issues, if I may. No, I just didn't like it there. They picked on me. - Who picked on you? - It doesn't matter. I've been picked on my whole life. Sometimes an orchestra must adjust itself to its musicians, and not the other way around. Okay. I know this is short notice, but I trust you. We will be playing Beethoven's 9th, as planned, but after the intermission, we will not be playing Scheherazade. Instead, we will be playing a concerto for harp and orchestra, by Fran√ßois Boieldieu. That's right, bring it in. A 19th-century postromantic composer. Sarah. Sarah. Hello. You look very pleased. My darling daughter. Have you fallen in love with a woman? I knew you wouldn't understand. Hagar, use your head. Don't be impulsive. I'm asking you, don't think like an Israeli in these situations. So now you don't want me to be an Israeli. Don't you dare do it. Can he hear us? I don't think so. What is it? What do you see when you look at me? It's the best thing I can do with my life. - Do you want her to make us a baby? - Do you? - No. - So there's no question here. - What did you tell her? - "Thanks, but no thanks." - That's what I said. - What exactly did you say? I said... I said it's a crazy offer, and that I'm not that modern. And what did she say? That things like that were done in the old days, too. Is that what she said? What exactly did she say? She said she would never raise a child... but she was willing to do this for me... with you, and she would give us the child. You want that. No. And what if I do? Honey? Four bees worked their whole lives to sweeten your tea. Would you like to see it? There. That is your son. What instrument do you think he will play? Judging by its movements, the trombone, or the trumpet. Give me your hand. You are impatient. That is not a good quality for a father. I am very patient, I just don't want any mistakes. My son will play the violin. "His hand for everyone, and everyone's hand for him." Genesis chp. 16 Try playing softer, not as stiff. From your fingertips. Remember? I love it when you play like that. That's great. Let's start at the beginning. What do you care if I start here? You don't play the right tempo. Let's start here. Why didn't you wait for me at home? I had a checkup at the doctor's. - So you're sick? - I'm not sick. I'm fine. Really. It's okay. Let's take it from the top, and watch your tempo. That's too fast. That's too fast! Are you doing this on purpose? I am not doing anything on purpose, it sounds better this way. You can't... You can't play like that, it says "pianissimo." I don't care what someone wrote 200 years ago. Come on. Like that. Okay. From the top. Come on, from the top. I don't want to play it from the top! Calm down, Ben. Calm down! Calm down, I said! Calm down already! - Calm down! I said, calm down! - Stop doing that! I'm sorry about the piano. May I play tomorrow? We will take a week off. Okay? Maybe things will calm down a bit. He's awake. He is waiting for you. I haven't slept at all while you were away. Turn around. Turn around for a moment. So you haven't slept for five days? What have you been doing at night? I was thinking about stuff. Nice stuff? Did you try to sleep but couldn't? Give me a hug. I don't want you to go away anymore. I'm pregnant. From whom? I really am pregnant. It's okay, don't worry. I don't intend to have it. I'm sorry I reacted this way, it's just... it's a miracle. A miracle? A miracle? I'm a medical miracle. How far along are we? What did Levin say? What difference does it make? This Sunday, after that Schoenberg of yours, damn him to hell, it'll meet its maker. Ben needs a brother. A little brother may calm him down. What do you want another child for? Maybe because you didn't get the first one as you planned. You wanted a violinist, and got a pianist. Talented, but he has no discipline, he can't concentrate in his playing. - Don't be mean. - Am I mean? Maybe this will help you stop fighting him. Are you calling me a bad mother? Thank you very much! Thank you for dropping in just to remind me. Where are you going? Leave me alone! Leave you alone? Where are you going? Get back here! I want to be alone! Sarah, get back here. Stop, I want to talk to you. Sarah. - Stand still for a second. - I don't want to. I'll help... I'll help you. Why are you following me everywhere? Sarah, get back here. Where are you going? Do you know how much I love you? "I will give you a son also by her." Genesis chp. 17 - Wow. The sun is shining. - More, more. - It's like the sun is shining. - Just a bit more. - Look how it becomes white. - Great, that's it. More. That's it! It stopped. Adjust the other one. A bit to the left. Look at Mommy, sweetie. Ben. You are in the frame, Ben. Come here, I'll lift you so you could see it better. Ben. Ben. Stop it, you're distracting him. Look at Mommy. Good. Please. So what brings you here, Maestro? A position opened up in my orchestra. So you want to play a concerto for oud? Leonid is leaving. It will do us all good if she came back. I want you to talk to her. He plays the piano. - Is he good? - He's great. Ever since he was small. He can pick up any instrument and know how... Abraham wanted him to play the violin. He's an idiot. He is obsessed with violinists. He tried teaching him, but the violin isn't for Ben. He has too much emotion in him. The violin is... you know. A few years ago, he took a $5000 violin and just smashed it. Abraham didn't say a word, but that was the end of it. When he was a little boy I couldn't stop looking at him. I thought he was the most beautiful thing in the world. I started to believe that he is actually mine. You haven't told him. I feared he wouldn't be able to bear it. Mom! Dear guests, thanks for coming. Today is Isaac's birthday, and Mommy and Daddy have a present for him. - Do you want the bow? - Do you want it? Take it. Pick up the bow with one hand. That's right! Do you want to hold it? - Like this. - That's right. Very good! Ben? What are you listening to? - Mozart! - Can I listen? Would you like some? Why is it sweet? Teach me how to play it. You are a great pianist. Your mother really wants you to learn to play the piano. I can't stand it. Teach me. I can pay you, I have money. Show me. - Don't you have shoes? - Not really. Are you sure we are going the right way? This is my father. - Ismail? - Ben. This is for you. Look at me. I know your father very well. You look just like him. You look like your mother, too. Ben? Ben? Ben? His roller skates are here. - Do you want to play on the horse? - Ben? Go on, play. Ben! Seventy-seven, a new record! Where did you get this trumpet? - Someone gave it to me. - Who? Stop it. Stop it. Calm down. Here, put this on. As much as you can. Now breathe out. Good, and do this with your lips. That's right. Let me show you. Like this. Now people can see your eyes. I'm trying to put him to sleep with the harp... Go to your room. Hey. Come to me. I asked you to stop playing, didn't I? Do you want to go to the concert with us? You love Scheherazade. Ben. Ben. I have to go. I just want to know that everything is okay. That you've calmed down. - Hi, Aviva. - Hi. Everything is fine. Isaac is asleep in our room, on the bed, and Ben won't be joining us, he is staying here. He doesn't want to come. Come with us. I want you to come. Ben? Ben, can you skate over to get his pacifier from your mother's bag? Ben! All right, I'll go get it. I'll be right back. Ben? Ben, open the door! - Ben! Ben! - Ben! Ben, open the door! Ben. Ben! Ben! What have you done to him? What have you done? Isaac? Isaac! Isaac... Isaac, are you all right? Isaac? Isaac! - He's not breathing! Isaac! - What's wrong? Give him to me. - Mommy! - Isaac... My Isaac, yes... - You're crazy! - Everything is fine. I don't want to be your son anymore. Go to your room this minute! Yes, I am a little worried. I don't think it's necessary to call the police, but if you could talk to Moshe, it'll help. He wasn't there when we woke up. We had a few issues at home. Right. "Take now your son, your only son, whom you love." Genesis chp. 22 Isaac, you're holding back. The audience will hear it. Go wild. Close your eyes. I can't close my eyes. You can't open up when you play with your eyes open. Close your eyes. Play badly. - Badly? - Badly. Not well. Play badly, as if you can't play. Don't play off tune, just play badly. From the top. You see? A piece is always between restraint and outburst. Between order and chaos. Just like life. When you play everything right, nothing really happens. Nothing. You need to drown in the piece, to fall down a hole, until you can't breathe. And now, play. Hold on. I want you to rehearse in the main hall, get a feel of the scale. You are still playing too small. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Are you sure? What is it? Nothing. Play however you like. The competition is not important. One final rehearsal? Give us a moment? I'll be downstairs. Maestro! Yes? - Were you referring to me? - Hello, Maestro, how are you? - Hello. - First of all, best of luck to us... What are you playing? The concerto my father wrote for me. I'm playing Brahms, third movement. I know your dad, we go to all of his concerts. Come on. Easy on the rosin. Let's go home. I'll walk. - Where is he going? - He wants to walk home. I knew he would do that. "And they went both of them together." Genesis chp. 22 Who are you? What are you doing here? - Who are you? - Where are you going? Who are you? Give me your case. - Let me see your case. - Where are you going? Who are you? What are you doing? That's Ismail! Right, that's Ismail! Are you hungry? Would you like something to drink? You don't want to speak? Hello, Hagar. His brother is with me in the car. I'm taking him to the club. Okay, see you. Do you play the violin? Yes. So play something for us.
