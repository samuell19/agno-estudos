[title music playing] [whizzing noises] [violin playing] JUPITER: We gods-- I, by the way, have the honor of being Jupiter --never tire of gazing down from Olympus upon this quaint little planet. But sometimes we become troubled, like Medusa on a bad snake day, about mortals and their unhappy sex lives. However, one man who has truly discovered the secret of connubial contentment resides here, in a seaside town on the Northwest corner of England. Who could possibly resist its inviting name, Blackpool, or indeed resist its fabled landladies, with their familiar greeting, "take your big mucky feet off my nice clean welcome mat." Ah, but those landladies are all the way at the moment, holidaying in Florida, Majorca, the Bahamas, or anywhere else one can reach by broomstick. The sands are now clear of their usual beer cans, orange peels, and other rather more graphic items, for you see, it's out of season here. The Blackpool tower-- illegitimate offspring of the one in Paris --watches over a wet and windy resort, the home of the contented citizen to whom I referred earlier. Malcolm drives a taxi, and he loves it. Personally I don't like people talking behind my back, but for Malcolm, life here-- in and out of season --is magic. [horn honking] Careful with them bags. Dennis, don't be so snappy. First time in Blackpool, is it? Yeah. We're very excited. Greatest city on Earth. We've got the world's tallest roller coaster. Did you know that? Really? Dennis, isn't that marvelous? I suppose so. We had the world's first electric street tram. Gosh. I had no idea. World's first end-of-the-pier helicopter service. And of course we've got the most beautiful women in the universe. Couldn't say the same about the women in Liverpool. Where you from? We're from Liverpool. Can you hurry up with them bags, lad? It's a bit chilly. M. [brakes squealing] Norma, I'm home. NORMA: (SINGING) And I'm far, far away, with my head up in the clouds. And I'm far, far away with my feet down in the crowds. Let it loose around the world, for the sound of home is loud-- still is loud. [clapping] [kissing loudly] Did you like it? Magic. I'm going to knock 'em dead on Saturday. You sure are. Are you doing the night shift? Sure am. And you're covered in flour. Hang on. [vacuum cleaner running] [malcolm chuckling] NORMA: Better. Now you got time for a little something? Oh, depends what kind of a little something you mean. Just a little something I prepared earlier. Norma, there are some things I'll always have time for. [SOFT SWINGING SAXOPHONE THEME PLAYING] JUPITER: But our Malcolm is a married man-- MALCOLM: Natalie, I'm home. JUPITER: --a very married man. [contented sigh] Ooh. [sighing deeply] [sniffing] Ugh, Malcolm. You stink of perfume. Yeah, hen night. Five wild women. I'm covered in spray. Aw, there should be more protection for the drivers. I don't mind it really. [muted trumpet theme playing] In fact I don't mind it at all. [dishes and cutlery rattling] I went shopping today. Wow. I bought it specially for Saturday. What do you think? It's magic. [humming with excitement] (CONCERNED) Oh. [nervous chuckling] Good. [sighing] [pop rock music playing] (SINGING) I won't laugh at you when you blue because I love you. I can turn my back on the things you lack because I love you. I just like the things you do. Ooh. Don't you change the things you do. Ooh. You get me in a spot, and smile the smile you've got when I love you. You make me out a cloud and you-- JUPITER: Malcolm's life is an idyll of happiness. But in the distance there lies a shadow that will change his life forever. (SINGING) Don't you change the things you do. Ooh. [bell ringing] Hello. Are you able to take me to the station, please? Thank you. [easy listening music playing] I say, could you just your mirror please? I need to touch my stuff up a bit. Brilliant. Do you find me attractive? Wh-- what was that? Do you think I'm sexy? (STAMMERING) S-- uh, sorry, did you say something? Goodness, I forgot my blouse. [sighing] Oh, careful, you'll-- you'll catch your death. I'd wrap up warm if I were you. I'm sorry. You're, uh-- you're sexy. You're very sexy. You're very attractive, but I'm married-- I'm very married. I don't believe in double standards. [bell ringing] [MUSIC - HEATWAVE, "BOOGIE NIGHTS"] (SINGING) Boogie nights. Boogie Nights. Ain't no doubt y'all here for a party. Boogie nights. Come on up. 'Bout to get it started. Dance with the boogie, get down. Dance with the boogie, get down. Boogie nights are always-- JUPITER: As you've just observed, a cab driver's fairly teems with temptation. Mercury once said, "having more than one woman in your life certainly does break the monogamy." This mortal has two perfect women living at opposite ends of the town. Why two wives? Because Malcolm truly believes in the sanctity of marriage-- and the 12-hour shifts. MALCOLM: Anyway, I think you're the tops. NORMA: And I think you are a delicious flatterer. Come on, you promised to drop me off at the shops. Ooh. We've managed to find this brilliant warehouse to put the show on Saturday. Saturday? [clattering] (SCOLDING) Careful, Malcolm. There's going to be potential clients from all over the north. MALCOLM: Great. - Yeah. I really want you to be there. Get in. [malcolm squealing in surprise] MALCOLM: Only last week someone was knocked down here. NATALIE: Oh God, that's terrible. What happened? NORMA: Well, it's just up there. You can't miss it. OK. Something like this. [tires peeling out] NATALIE: (SCOLDING) Malcolm. MALCOLM: Well, I got tired of waiting. [giggling] NATALIE: You little daredevil. [tires squealing] DRIVER: Stupid bastard. [funk music playing] Morning, fellas. Morning, Malcolm. Hi, Felicity. Guys, it just come through on the radio, there's six models wanted taxis at Elm Street. [everyone talking at once] So young, so naive. Let the [inaudible] Fact is, nine out of 10 chicks would prefer living in Marxism. You have read the latest edition, I assume. Oh, I don't have time these days, Jasper. I'm wrecked. I can't keep up the pace anymore. Hm. Symptomatic of capitalism. Wouldn't you say so, Felicity? [dog whining] [electronic dance music playing] Oh, it's looking good. Looking good. All right, lads. Chacho and Kevin, practice the whip action. I want to hear the crack. Has anyone seen frog woman? Hi, baby. Ooh, nice tiger, now. [purring lasciviously] Frog woman. Frog woman. Here you go, darling. [inaudible] All right. Up slow, and then [grunting] All right. How are we going to get that thing up there? Where is it? [singing to self] See you later, Felicity. Strange man. So you feeling OK? NORMA: (ON PHONE) I'm fine. That's good. And is your voice OK? NORMA: (ON PHONE) It's 100% on. Good do-- do you want me to get you any vitamin C or anything? Don't worry, Mal. I'll be fine. And-- and what about your dress? Is it OK? You want me to get you some new shoes? Don't worry your daft head, puss. I'll be all right. Right, well I'll come over and pick you up after the game. OK. I love you, Mal. Magic. See you, Felicity. Bye, Jasper. He's a major Natalie, Natalie. He's just the kid he's always wanted. Naturally you are invited to the event. You interested? - Yes, actually. - Ah, super. It's a live one. We'll look forward to it. [giggling] [whip cracking] Who's being a naughty boy, then? Oh, hello, John. [chuckling] Atcha. Atcha. [INHALING AND EXHALING EXCITEDLY] There's the stitch. (GIGGLING) Oh, boys. [making kissing noises] [laughing] Ooh. [giggling] You know, you won't believe what has just happened. You're pregnant. Oh, no, no. It's much better than that. I am going to be famous. [laughing] It's a huge contract, and you'll never guess who it is. It's George Michael, isn't it? [laughter] It's Elton John. It's Frank Sinatra. The Archbishop of Canterbury. No, I know, it's Tony Blair. Oh, no, no. He's far too conservative. Now this is a high-octane, high-paying rock star. Oh, now. Flaunt it. [laughter] It could be the biggest break I've ever had. Wow. [giggling] Here, darling. Look after these, will you? Come here. Malcolm, do you want to [making two clicks with mouth] MALCOLM: I would love to. I'm dying to know who this commission is for. Ooh, well. Now I've got you so interested, I think I'll keep it a secret. [kissing noise] MALCOLM: Ooh, I like secrets. [giggling] Now you see, panther, I've made a lot of sacrifices in our marriage. Remember, I gave up Wolverhampton for you. So this is one occasion where you've got to wear your hobby hat. Yeah. Now when this star wears my costumes, you've got to be there, OK? No matter what, you've got to be there. (GAGGING) Sure. Promise. (STRUGGLING) I promise. [cooing] [both moaning softly] [electronic dance music playing] [car motor running] MAN (ON RADIO): Chester versus Blackpool town. Micky Mellon scored in the first half for Blackpool, moments after he was punched in the eye during a midfield fracas, five minutes into the second half. Tony Ellis equalized from the corner. He subsequently tripped and broke his ankle. The final score was a 1-all draw. Crowd injuries, Chester 16, Blackpool 21. Bad luck, Blackpool. Eh, Freddy Fraser scored in the first half just after he was punched in the eye, and then five minutes into the second half, Lenny Lovin equalized from the corner. Can you believe it? That later on he trips, and broke his ankle. Are you all right, love? Hey, I'm sorry I was late. I'm just so nervous about tonight, Mal. Hey, Normy, you're going to be great. Remember, it takes (RECITING TOGETHER) skill to sing, it takes luck to win the lottery, but to perform, all you need is love. What's with all this? - Don't know. Kids, most likely. Come on. I don't want to be late. Very nice, darling. What a beauty. [crowd cheering] Ladies and gentlemen-- ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I want a 12, please, ladies and gentlemen. That's Norma Nettles, number 12. Come on. Big hand. [crowd cheering] OK. [pop ballad playing] (SINGING) Every day, when I'm away, I'm thinking of you. Everyone, can carry on, except for we two. And you know that I love, and you know that I, and you know that our love won't die. And it won't even-- She's great, isn't she? Magic. Could be worth a tidy little sum. I'm trying to listen. Hey, mate. I work for Noddy Holder. You mean Noddy Holder out of Slade? I do. I mean the greatest rock and roller of all time. Oh. I'd like to see her perform with Mr. Holder. Are you serious? MAN: Yeah. At Blackpool Empire next Saturday night. A duet-- that's the two of 'em. Would she be game? [laughs] There's nothing she'd like more. Right. Well. Shh. Not a word to the lady. (SINGING) And no one will know. One little wave to say you'll behave. It won't even show how far love can go. [cheering and applause] And now, ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for a special man. To award the prizes, could you please welcome to the stage the personal public relations advisor to all the greatest stars in the Northwest, Mr. Reggie Fisher! [cheering and applause] And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. In third position-- it's number eight! Freddie Bag from [inaudible]. For a wonderful rendition of "Stairway to Heaven." Wonderful. [cheering and applause] And coming in second place, ladies and gentlemen, it is-- number six! The [inaudible] Twins from [inaudible].. Yes! What a tremendous performance of "I Got You, Babe." Tremendous! And now, ladies and gentlemen, in the numero uno spot for her extraordinary and deeply moving rendition of "Every Day" by Slade, it's number 12, Norma Needles! Blackpool's own! [cheering and applause] The queen of karaoke! Ah! Oh! Norma, how would you like to sing with the great singer of them all! How would you like to sing a duet with Noddy Holder? [cheering and applause] Because that's what we've lined up for you this Saturday night. Noddy Holder, the greatest pop star of the century, or thereabouts, [laughter] is gonna tear apart the Blackpool Empire mirror by mirror, seat by seat, with his bare voice, and you're gonna help him do it! Whad'ya say, huh? [cheering and applause] Thank you. [soft music] Oh, Malcolm. I think it was such a romantic idea of yours to camp out. [giggling] [chuckling] Noddy Holder. I still can't believe it. Oh, Malc. What's this? Let's see. I met him when I was a kid. You never told me. Just hope I don't let him down. Of course you won't. Not with me there. Hey. I wouldn't miss this for the world. You're the perfect husband, Malcolm. I do try me best. [birds chirping] [upbeat music] Oh, yes. Beautiful. So talented. Yeah. Aren't I a lucky guy? Yeah. Uh-huh, that's it. That's the way, yeah. Nice. Nice! Right. And give me some-- really feel-- yes. Yes. Oh. God, yeah. Oh, yeah! Now, keep going and tell me who it is. Oh, tell. [giggling] Please? Shall I give you a clue? Yeah. (SINGING) It's Christmas! Noddy Holder? Yes! Ah. Noddy bloody Holder. [panting] [dramatic music] Noddy Holder. Thought you were gonna come out at Christmas. [metal clanging] I'm sorry. [dog barking] [door clicking] For the princess. Hmm. For our rock star [inaudible]. Ah! What-- Eurovision. You've got tickets for the Eurovision Song Contest! Oh, the Eurovision Song Contest always makes me so incredibly horny. [laughing] Oh, wait a minute, Malcolm. These are for the same day as the Noddy Holder Blackpool Extravaganza. You'll have to take them back. Oh, I didn't now. I really wanted to go to Eurovision this year as well. Ooh, you're such a tease. Well, maybe I can tempt you. Malcolm, you are coming with me to see Noddy Holder. He's famous and he'll be wearing my designs. Now, I'm not going to let you break your promise, am I? [music playing] - Two prawn surprises? - Oh. - Thank you. - Oh, yeah. Thank you very much. Enjoy your meal. You are lovely to bring me here. Aw. Norma, you're the tops. You're the Blackpool Tower-- only, you know. [giggling] What wouldn't I do for you, eh? For you, the world. Normie, uh, this Saturday-- Yes? If-- if you don't want me to go, then I-- I don't mind. Don't want you to? Malcolm, I won't sing without you. Well, Eurovision is on the same night, so I really don't mind. Eurovision? Last night you said you wouldn't miss this for the world. [clears throat] Well, I-- I just thought, you know, maybe if I wasn't there, you'd get on better with Noddy and-- Malcolm, I don't want to seduce Noddy, I just want to sing with him. I can't do this without your support. I won't be able to sing without you there. REG: Natalie, your carriage awaits. Thanks, Reg. Um, about the, uh-- Oh, don't worry, don't worry. There's a check in the post. Thanks. This fell. Look who's here. It's the karaoke queen! Just look at you two love birds having a little celebration. She deserves it. Ladies and gentlemen, our national karaoke champion! [applause] Is the hubby looking forward to it? I was just saying, perhaps it would be best if I didn't-- Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, no! You want him there? Mr. Holder wants him there too. Yeah, but-- No buts. Mr. Holder is into the caring, sharing '90s image these days. We can't have Norma singing without the husband. But, uh-- Look. Bums on seats. You won't let us down. Of course he won't. Will you, Malcolm? Normie. I'm-- I'm with you all the way. Just relax. You'll enjoy it. Well, catch ya. I've got fish to fry. Honestly, Malcolm. This is the most important day of my life. I'd almost rather you came to this than our wedding. NARRATOR: Malcolm's life has become a troubled dream. [MUSIC - HEATWAVE, "BOOGIE NIGHTS"] (SINGING) Boogie nights. Boogie nights. Ain't no doubt, we are here to party. Boogie nights. Come on out, got to get it started. Dance with the boogie, get down. Dance with the boogie, get down. 'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town. Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing. Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing. Boogie nights. Get that groove, let it take you higher. Boogie nights. Make it move, set this place on fire. Dance with the boogie, get down. Dance with the boogie, get down. 'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town. Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing. Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing. Party right. Can you show that you know how to do it. Boogie nights. Do it, do it. Party right. Get on down to the sound of the music. Boogie nights. Music, music. Boogie nights. Boogie nights. Boogie nights. Ain't no doubt, we are here to party. Boogie nights. Come on out, got to get it started. Dance with the boogie, get down. Dance with the boogie, get down. 'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town. Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing. Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing. Boogie nights. Get that grove-- My dear Phoebe, doesn't Malcolm look somewhat shagged out? Would you not say, my dear? Been to any decent orgies recently? 30. 30 years since my last orgy. I mean, I still believe in free love, but alas the Marxist has no time for easy pleasures. Oh, speaking of which. I've never heard of it until two weeks ago. Now the fellow's all over the place. What do we say? I can't. But it's a gift. I just can't, Jasper. It's me wife. She's singing and doing the costumes. Oh. Busy girl. They're gonna murder me. Who's they? She gets so nervous. Jasper, if I don't go, Norma will never be able to sing. Uh-- wait a minute. Who's Norma? Who's they? You haven't joined the resistance, have you? Here. If you need a job done, that is your man. He is quite simply the best there is. REG: Right, Norma. Once more with feeling. (SINGING) I just like the things you do, ooh. Don't you change the things you do-- [hiccups] Careful on the high notes. Not to loud. Did you know Mr. Holder never practices on the day before a concert? - Really? - Yeah. He spends hours in the gym working every other muscle in his body. But the only muscle he never overtrains are his vocal chords. I can only manage 15 minutes a session nowadays. Even then, I don't do it often enough. You need to get yourself a new man, love. [giggling] Bye, Norma. Bye-byes. Hello, Morris. Not running away? No, no. Just arrived, actually. Lovely singing voice your wife got. She's a dream ticket. A bit like this one. [laughing] I've got a passenger waiting who's promised me 250 pounds to drive into Edinburgh. No-- hang on, what about the gala? What about Noddy? You promised me. But it's a lot of money, Norma. I don't care about that. I won't be able to sing if you're not there. You know how nervous I get, Malcolm. It's-- it's-- 250 pounds. And what's money compared to love? To perform, all you need is love, Malcolm. I didn't mean it. Of course-- of course I'll go with you. Careful about the scratch factor. We don't want him needing a testicle tuck-in for a year's time. Ah. Well, that's already part of the service. You see, I've made him a little pair of scrotum snugglers. Keep 'em hidden. Some things are sacred. (SINGING) Come on feel the noise. [laughs] [car starting] Malcolm? What are you doing? Just, uh, checking for greenfly. You know, what you need is a workout. [music playing] [groaning] I'm trying to tell you-- oh! Stop it-- [groaning] Please. Ah! [grunting] I'm trying to tell you. The Rubber Ball. Paris on Saturday. You'll love it. Leather, PVC, whips, chains, rubber, beautiful people in beautiful costumes. Just think of all that inspiration. Oh, you're such a flirt. Yeah, but it's a fantastic opportunity-- not just for your business, but for us too. Just think of it. A few days away, just the two of us. The most romantic city in the world. Oh, monsieur, you are really turning me on. Walking by the Seine. Holding hands. Croissant in a corner cafe, just watching the world go by. Hey, I might even let you take me to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Natalie? NATALIE: I'm not gonna let you break your promise. NARRATOR: Desperate times call for desperate measures. [thunder crashing] [knocking] [locks clanging] Can you lend me a fiver? I-- I wonder if you can help me. I-- I don't like Russians! [locks clanging] Uh, no, Jasper said-- MAN: Go away! Can't you see there's no one here? I'm-- I'm looking for somebody called Sam Tex. Really? That's me. Come on in. [chickens clucking] This way. It's so good to see you. I was expecting you to be taller. Ah, do let me take your coat. You don't have one? Never mind. Would you, uh-- would you like some tea? [pots clattering] I'm so sorry. The maid is away! Today! [sheep bleating] So-- so, so sorry. What-- what's on your mind? I hope you don't mind the clutter. But, uh, as you can see, we're terribly busy at the moment, what with the wedding and everything. Do take a seat. I'd-- I'd offer you something to eat, only Juanita, the maid, hasn't finished shopping yet! This week! [sheep bleating] [chicken clucking] So, so sorry. There-- there should be a cushion there. Hope there's enough room. As you can see, we're terribly, terribly busy. Redecorating next week. Uh-- you are Sam Tex? That is correct. Couldn't lend me a fiver, could you? Maybe. I understand you blow up buildings. How much to blow up the Empire nightclub? Do you know it? $5 million. What? You want me to blow up the Empire? $5 million. It's a flat fee. There's no hidden extras. Look, don't go. $4 million, not a penny less, OK? I'll-- I'll tell you what, my final offer. My final offer is $1 million. $500,000. $300. No, I'll tell you-- don't-- let me just check with my charts first, please. Ah. Yes, the moon is in Uranus. Love life is looking up. Pluto's bounding into retrograde in Mercury. That's bad. That's very bad. But Saturn is moving onto the cusp of Mars. The cusp of Mars, that-- that reminds me. Look, I haven't got all night. OK. I'll do it. - What? [phone ringing] [gunshot] [glass shattering] [chicken clucking] I just want to know how much. I'll tell you what. I will blow up the Empire if you pay my electricity bill. Ha-ha! [clatter] Please call by again. You won't get it cheaper anywhere else! Dirty beasts. Ugh! [chickens clucking] Awoo-ah! [singing softly] Ha. What's the matter with you? Nothing. I've been under a lot of stress at work. Crazy schedules. There's been a lot of client pressure recently. Aw. Traffic is getting very fast. The roads just aren't what they used to be. Look, Malc. I was going to save this till the big day, but-- it's for luck. Oh, magic. Thanks. love. Thought you'd like it. [iron hissing] Oh! Ooh! They're certain to meet at this big event. I, uh, don't know what this friend of mine's gonna do. Tough, isn't it? It's hell. Well, it's happened to me more times than I can count. I usually hole up with Molly and the secretary. Well, she can't actually tie it, but, uh, she's good in certain situations. Know what I mean? Oh, by the way, this friend of yours. Where did he find such gullible girlies? [tires screeching] They're not gullible, all right? They're perfect. OK. [music playing] Men like you should be hung, drawn, and quartered. You should be pinned to the ground while your testicles are skewered like red hot kebabs. It's not me, it was a friend, OK? I've heard all about female circumcision, and now I know who is responsible! (GAGGING) Look-- no, stop, it's not me! It's another driver! Take it up a bit. So you see, I don't know what to do. You can have me anytime. I ain't fussy, love. [laughing] Marriage, eh? It's not easy, is it? [crying] So as you can see, it's all very complicated. I mean, what do you do in a situation like that, eh? [knocking] [locks clanging] What are you doing here? I thought you'd forgotten me. I've decided to hire you. [chuckling] Right. Come on. Get your stuff together and let's go. No. No, I couldn't-- I couldn't. I'm-- I'm not ready. I-- I just don't feel up for it today. Today is a bad day. Is this part of it? What about this? Look, just tell me what you need and we'll gather it all together. Come on, let's move. Leave it alone! Put it down! It's personal! I-- I-- I absolutely don't feel up to this today. It's-- it's too early in the week. I'm sure it'll end in disaster. Nothing ever works at the start of a week. It's Friday. [chickens clucking] Well, I'm ready when you are. Let's do it. [suspenseful music] [ticking] (WHISPERING) Let's stand back. [explosion] Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! What was that? A bomb. A bomb? That? If I wanted a paint job, I'd call a decorator. I thought you were gonna blow the whole building up! You should not have rushed me! You made me bring the wrong kit. You confused paint and dynamite? - Well, maybe-- - Maybe. Well, I hope I'm not there when you decide to paint your house. That was a joke. You should not make jokes to trained professionals. A trained professional what? I could give you the entire world's nuclear arsenal, you wouldn't be able to melt an igloo. You're not even a very good graffiti artist. Look, I'm sorry! OFFICER BEN: Hey, you two! What are you up to? Nothing. I-- Go on, run! OFFICER BILL: Stop! Police! [panting] Come on. Come on. OFFICER BILL: Where are they, Ben? OFFICER BEN: I don't know. We'd better go back and report. [footsteps receding] [sneezes loudly] - Oh! You are incompetent! You're a bleeding liability! I'm terribly, terribly sorry. It's my allergies, you know. I have this reaction to walls. It's the height. It's the climate. And late in the park it's-- Get off me! Get off me! Sorry! Sorry! What about my electricity bill? You can forget it. But you promised-- You're joking, aren't you? Well, goodnight, then. You couldn't lend me a fiver could you? Fine, fine, fine, fine. [sneezes] I can't get my head around this. But you're normally such a turbocharged rhino in bed, Malc. [growling] MALCOLM: Hmm. [sighs] What's wrong with you? You're usually very good on a Saturday morning. [doorbell ringing] Oh. That'll be Reg. I'll bring him over. Coming. Hello, Reg. REG: Aw, you're looking gorgeous. NATALIE: [laughs] I bet you say that to all the girls. I'm just up here. Funny enough, me husband's [inaudible].. REG: [inaudible] Malcolm? [music playing] [chatter] Thank you. He couldn't blow his own nose, let alone a three-story building. He's just tried to blow up the Empire using a paint bomb, for Christ's sake. Don't tell me he's taken to environmental bombing. If there's to be a revolution, there has to be flames! What the hell am I gonna do? I'm done for. What was it you were trying to do anyway? Something to do with the government oppressing your wife? I'm just trying to get out of a social engagement. My god. You're an anarchist. I thought you were just left-wing. Jasper, please, just think. Well-- you could just shoot yourself in the foot. Look who's here. The big boy. You're looking a bit down, champ, since last time. Everything all right? Just wait till you see Mr. Holder. That'll cheer you up. Oh, come on, Malc. I thought you'd be a bit more excited than that. Sorry, I'm, uh-- I'm in a rush. Now, Morris, it is the wife's special night and all. No need to look so glum about it. It's going to be a party, for heaven's sake. How about a smile for the queen of karaoke? Hmm. I'll leave you two lovebirds together. Gotta rush off. Meeting a woman who's doing the costume. Her man's coming along too, so you'll have someone to keep you company, Morris. Should be a great night, hmm? [chuckling] Catch ya. A bit further. Let's see. Go on. Look at those crafty eyes. The devilish and cruel smile. A born criminal, Ben. Yes. [music playing] [gunshot] [gunshot] Brain hemorrhage about five minutes ago. And the feet? We'll have to amputate. Tragic. Take a deep breath. I still don't understand what you were doing with that thing. I thought it was the hoover. Yeah, it's just a mild graze. Nothing to worry about. - Is that all? It looks much-- much more serious than a mild graze. It's definitely just a mild graze. But, yeah-- but, I mean, shouldn't I stay in bed for a couple of weeks? [laughing] After tonight. [knocking] [locks clanging] Sam, can I have a word? I don't think so. My self-esteem is at an all-time low since you said all those things. You should be ashamed of yourself. Now, please just go away and leave me to forget. Look, I'm sorry, OK? No! Listen, you great berk, it's not my fault you cocked things up completely. Oh, so I cocked things up, did I then? Sam, just open the door, please. Give me a tenner, will you? Thank you. Now, piss off! Look, Sam-- I never want to speak to you again. It's you Russians that give Communism a bad name. I'm not a bloody Russian. Please. If you don't go away now, I'll set Hercules on you. He's a big black dog with very sharp teeth. Ow! Hey, Malcolm. Are you gonna see the great Noddy Holder? Uh-- All the lads are going, even Elvis here. Well, he did pay for us, after all. Let me give you a ride in my taxi. NARRATOR: As a great genius once said-- hmm, I forget the actual occasion on which I said it. If you don't know the difference between good and bad advice, you don't need advice. But one should always seek wise counsel in times of trouble. Poor Malcolm can only go to his friend Jasper. Now, where can I take you? Jasper, I'm-- I'm not really sure. Then I'll take you to your car. OK. And here we are. Thanks. Uh, look, can you-- You know, you really do look pretty bad. And you appear to have hurt your foot. Yes. I, uh, tried to shoot it. Oh! [laughing] Did you hear that, Felicity? He's a born pacifist. He couldn't even shoot his own foot! Well, it was moving very fast at the time. Oh! [laughing] You know, it really would be much easier for you to ingest cigarette ash. That's how I avoided military service. You are a savior. Uh, that's, uh, 1 pound 20, thank you. Hmm. Keep the change. How very kind. [clatter] Excuse me. I'm-- I'm just collecting cigarette ash. Bar's collecting my cigarette ash. Didn't think you'd still need it. Here's old ones from out back. [inaudible] want anything else? [music playing] (SINGING) Come on feel the noise. Girls, grab the boys. God, Malcolm. Are you OK? [vomiting] You again? - Sorry? - Lie down. What is it? Looks like some sort of ash. Cigarette ash, probably. Cigarette ash? Malcolm, darling. If you're into that sort of thing, why didn't you tell me? No, it can't-- it can't be. That's what the doctor says. Oh, it's definitely cigarette ash, my friend. Uh, it must be inner city pollution. Look, I don't know what you're doing, but I suggest that you just clear off and stop wasting our time and resources. Ooh. Doesn't cigarettes ash cause cancer? Push off, you scrimshanker. Have you been here before, Malcolm? I don't know what she was on about. Do you fancy playing doctors and nurses? Ben. Hmm? Golden Mile Taxis. Correct, Bill. Those reading classes are obviously paying off. Ben, it's on his shirt. What? I'm with you now. Picking him up should be as easy as tying your shoelaces. OK, I'll do it! Eh? I'll put in the jets. On one condition. You don't criticize me, you leave me to do my own thing. Yeah, whatever you say. What, you're just gonna pop in and blow it up? I am an expert with explosives! That is correct. But first of all, I gotta go down to the supermarket. Always get a bit peckish before a job. That reminds me, I better go and feed my chickens. OK, you wait till 8 o'clock, then you'll see what I'm made of. Smithereens! 8 o'clock? - You're welcome. - No, wait. Sam, you can't do it then. Someone will get hurt! Sam! [honking] Stop! My friends want to cross. Do you know that's my boyfriend? And he's much slower than he used to be. Well, you're all right. I'll-- I'll reverse. Good. [crashing] MALCOLM: Sorry, I've really gotta go. NURSE: You've got whiplash and you're probably concussed. Just sit down. MALCOLM: I'm going! NURSE: Can I get some help in here! Nurses! [grunting] Hey! I've gotta go! There's a bomb! Argh! [suspenseful music] Yargh! [snickering] [door slamming] [alarm ringing] [gasps] Not you again. I've-- I've got to go. Not till I've examined you. We're looking for a renegade of society who declines to conform to social norms, or even simple mores of human decency. Have you seen this face? That's Malcolm. Ah. Now, if you boys were to arrest him, he would be delighted. You see, he doesn't like Noddy Holder. I beg your pardon? Noddy Holder? What sort of a sicko doesn't like Noddy Holder? He's definitely going to need an x-ray. He's a very difficult patient. He seems to want to discharge himself. He keeps going on about a bomb. Probably the concussion. We'll just have to hope there's no permanent brain damage. [chatter] I'm from the Midlands too, Mr. Holder. NODDY HOLDER: [inaudible] [chatter] Hi. You look great. Awesome jacket. [clears throat] Um, here you are, sir, for your comfort. NODDY HOLDER: Ta very much. Everything hunky-dory? Hubby coming along tonight? He will. Cutting it a bit fine, isn't he? He's fine. He's just got a lot on his plate at the moment. Client pressure, targeting schedules, learning curves, you know. Tell me about it, sister. Um, I hope it fits. NODDY HOLDER: It's awesome. It's incredible. Oh! Only I was a bit worried. NODDY HOLDER: It's just perfect. (WHISPERING) Yes! Ta-da! [applause] What do you think? It's great. Oh, yes. [sighs] MUSICIAN: It's crazy, Ma! Lock up your daughter! Whoo! [loud chatter] Excuse me, sorry. Thanks. Excuse me. OK, let's do it! Let's feel the noise! GROUP: Rockin' A, Mr. Holder! I feel like-- I feel like Noddy Holder! [cheering] Feel like Noddy Holder? Feel the noise! Malcolm! Ah. Why didn't you put on those trousers I bought you and your new jacket? Well, no-- yes, I agree, yes. (LAUGHING) Malcolm. [music playing] [cheering and screaming] [gasps] Ooh, uh, I've got to, uh-- the toilet. But Noddy's here! Well, I'll be back soon. Oh! Hello, Malcolm. Lovers' tiff? Look, could you, uh-- thanks. I'll be back in a minute. Ah, Mr. Holder. Here's your sparkling partner for the duet this evening, Ms. Norma Needles. Oh! It's the same surname as me. Baby, she's the queen. Feel the noise, baby. [laughing] Feel the noise. [ticking] [knocking] It's you. The number of people that have been in and out of this place. It's like a public lavatory. What about-- (WHISPERING) the bomb? The what? (WHISPERING) The B-O-M-B. The-- the B-- the B-O-- the-- the bomb! The bomb! Tell me you haven't set it. Please tell me you haven't set it. It's all ready. Just need somebody to flush it. You idiot! There's people out there! I want you to disarm it straight away! But you promised me! I did not! Disarm it now. I don't know how to! Hello. Hello. [door slamming] That one's free. She's coming 'round. There's a girl. How are you, baby? Yeah, how are you, baby? Are you all right? Here, take my arm. I'm Natalie. Norma. I know exactly how you feel. Are you going to be OK to feel the noise, baby? NODDY HOLDER: Yeah, baby. Feel the noise. Uh, why don't you take a break, Mr. Holder, huh? Well, all right. You guys relax a moment while I prepare for my show. [toilet flushing] Bloody idiot. We could all have been killed. [door slamming] Sticky tape? Never without it. Jasper. How did I let him talk me into this? [hushed chatter] Well, it's not exactly Woodstock, but it seems there are one or two people left who still recognize that Noddy Holder is the greatest god of rock. Amen. [sighs] I wonder where my husband is? Sit there and keep quiet. SAM: [laughing] Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Look, I just can't sing without him. What do you mean you can't sing without him? I want him here where I can see him. I want him in the wings. I'd quite like my man here too. Jesus. This is not a bloody picnic! - Reg? - What! [vomiting] Oh! Oh, come on. You've got two minutes. Come on! Hey, where you going? Listen, you've got to get everybody out of here. There's a bomb. - No, no. Just 'cause you haven't got a ticket-- We'll all be killed! Security, we got a real daft one here. Hang on. I don't know if I can go through with it. Listen, mate. As long as you keep your fucking whiskers on, no one's gonna know the difference, are they? What if the real Noddy should show up? The real Noddy Holder lives in Bermuda or somewhere. What's the matter with you? There must be 1,000 people out there. That's right. Think of it as 40,000 quid. Pull yourself together. Come on, you can do it! You are Noddy Holder. Go on. Go on, say it. BOTH: I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. Go on. - I am Noddy Holder. - Go on. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. [crowd clapping] I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am-- Can we not wait a bit longer? I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. I am Noddy Holder. [microphone feedback] He's been a long time coming, but when you come from the stars, you've got a long way to come. It's my privilege to welcome back to Blackpool, formerly lead singer of Slade, the one, the only, the greatest, Noddy Holder! [cheering and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. All right, boys. (SINGING) Baby, baby, baby. [MUSIC - SLADE, "CUM ON FEEL THE NOIZE"] Ee-ow! So you think I got an evil mind. Well, I'll tell you, honey. And I don't know why. And I don't know why. So you think my singing's out of time. Well, it makes me money. And I don't know why. And I don't know why anymore. Oh, no. So come on feel the noise. Girls, grab the boys. [ominous music] SAM: Tick tock. Tick tock. (SINGING) Girls, grab your boys. We get wild, wild, wild at your door. He's, um, sort of different live, isn't he? Yeah. NODDY HOLDER: (SINGING) --feel the noise. Girls, grab the boys. We get wild, wild, wild. [gasps] There's my husband! Huh? And my husband's with him. There's a-- there's a bomb. Bomb. NATALIE: What? Yeah! There's a bomb, and that's not Noddy. Not Noddy. Not-- (SINGING) So come on feel the noise. Girls, grab the boys. We get wild, wild, wild at your door. [cheering and applause] Thank you. REG: Ladies and gentlemen, here to sing a duet with the sublime Noddy is this year's national karaoke champion. Give her a big hand. Norma Needles! [cheering and applause] Good luck. Hah. [music - slade, "coz i luv you"] (SINGING) I won't laugh at you when you boo-hoo-hoo, 'cause I love you. I can turn my back on the things you lack, 'cause I love you. I just like the things you do. Ooh. Don't you change the things you do. Ooh. You get me in a spot and smile the smile you've got when I love you. You make me out a clown, then you put me down. I still love you. I just like the things you do. Ooh. SAM: I'll make toasted cheese sandwiches of the whole place. (SINGING) Don't you change the things you do. Ooh. Tick tock. Tick tock. (SINGING) When you bite your lip, you're gonna fib your fib, but I love you. When we're miles apart, you still reach my heart. How I love you. Tick tock. Tick tock. (SINGING) La la-la la la. La-la la la-la la la-la la la-la la la. [cheering and applause] Hey, hey, hey, that's my wife. Oh, great. Sorry, Norma. I'm-- I'm sorry to interrupt your concert, everybody, but there is a bomb in the building. REG: What? [screaming] Now, there's nothing to worry about. It's only a very small bomb. REG: Rubbish, don't listen to him. No, there is, honestly. There's a bomb. REG: Will somebody please get that lunatic off the stage? Malcolm! What's happening? Natalie, you've got to get out of here! REG: Security! - You know my Malcolm? - Ah, now-- Your Malcolm? He's my husband! Oh yeah? Oh yeah. MAN: Boo! Get off! Let Noddy sing! Yeah? Let Noddy sing? This man is not Noddy Holder! REG: Remain calm. There is no bomb. I repeat, there is no bomb. I repeat, there is no bomb! Oh, right. [toilet flushing] [alarm ringing] [yelling] [explosion] [yelling] [crowd shouting] REG: Please remain calm. There is no bomb. I repeat, there is no bomb. I repeat, there is no bomb. I think you better come home with me. I think maybe you ought to come home with me. Now, listen, darling. I have known Malcolm for 9 years. 9 years, 11 months, 4 weeks, 3 days, 8 hours and counting. OK, your place, then. DRIVER: Taxi, ladies? BOTH: It's on account. DRIVER: All right, hop in. Up the revolution! [music playing] That way, quick. I'll follow. CROWD: Noddy! Oi! He went that way! WOMAN: There he is! MAN: Noddy! My mother always said men are like tomcats. My mother always said men are from Mars, women are from Venus. We use our brains, and they use their penis. [laughing] Oh. Oh, right now I could kill for a Terry's Chocolate Orange. He did that for you as well? How will this do? You sure you'll be OK? Yeah, fine. Thanks, Jasper. Chin up, Charlie. Tell you what. You take Felicity for company. Come on, then. [music playing] [sniffling] Oh, god, what a day, eh? Noddy Holder's a fraud, but so is my husband. And mine. I should have known something was wrong when he wouldn't let me measure him. Who? Malcolm? - No, Noddy Holder. And then there was all those times when I'd never get to see him. Who, Noddy Holder? No, Malcolm. That's a nice color. Ooh, ta. It's got sparkly [inaudible]. So you're a fashion designer, then? Ah, yeah. Well, sort of. Mostly kinky stuff. You know, um, latex, rubber, furry handcuffs. Ooh, ah! It's nice. And did Malcolm-- Oh, yeah. He was really into that sort of thing. Did you never-- No. No. I sing. Of course you do. Very good. So how often did you two do it? 12 and 1/2 times a week. [knocking] The thing is, Felicity, I love 'em both. I do really, both of 'em. That's the thing. Ladies, you may be aware there's been an incident tonight at the Blackpool Empire. Yes, we know about that. Noddy Holder's concert has been cruelly aborted. But that's not why we're here. We discovered the remnants of a bomb in the lavatory. We can't understand it. What sort of a sick man would try to assassinate Noddy Holder? But-- but it's not Noddy-- We'd like to bring your husband in for questioning. Would you care for a segment? I love you, Norma. I love you, Natalie. [music playing] [snoring] [felicity whimpering] [church bells ringing] [doorbell ringing] Do you feel better now, Norma? Much better, thank you, Natalie. Oh, and another thing. Yah! Oh! Uh! Aw! DISPATCH (ON RADIO): All units to 18, that's 1-8, Acacia Avenue. Suspected IC-1 terrorist on the premises. Good luck, gentlemen and ladies. I'm sorry, OK? I wouldn't do anything to hurt either of you. [sirens blaring] What's going on? Vandalism and suspected terrorism. If you're lucky, you'll get 15 years. Sorry, Norma. Sorry, Natalie. I love you! [thrilling music] All right, now. Whoa! [crashing] Get his helmet. Do you know how to drive one of these? Of course I do. I was in the Girl Guides. [groaning] What? No. No. Come on. Come on, come on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [siren approaching] Come back here, you filthy pervert! [music playing] BEN: I can't see, Bill! - Oh, look. Noddy Holder. He's smiling at us. Get it off for fuck's sake! Ooh, ooh, ooh! [inaudible] Ah, Mr. Jones. I'm so sorry, madam. I seem to have a pressing engagement. But I thought you were taking me to Fleetwood? [sirens approaching] But I thought you were taking me to Fleetwood? Power to the people! I love you. BOTH: Bullocks! I do love you, really. Power to the people! He's making for the pier! He'll not get away. [tires screeching] [glass shattering] - Oh! OK, I hit that. [inaudible] roller. Hey! Come back here, you miscreant! Stop shouting! [music playing] [engine rumbling] NORMA: You'll suffer for this! NATALIE: Come here, you bloody bastard! [wind howling] NARRATOR: Can our Malcolm really have lost the only woman he'll ever love and the only other woman he'll ever love? I say no. We gods must prevent this.
