Attention, please. Your attention, please. Um, I hate to pull you away from your lamb and cabernet but I just want to make a quick announcement about my son, Richie. Tonight, we are making him the youngest managing director in the history of our little company. Well done, kiddo. You earned it. Well done. Come on. Stand up, Richie. Come on. Get up there. You know, I... I couldn't have done any of this without my beautiful bride, Hunter. She is, and has been, so giving, selfless.. Well, she is the light of my life. Aw! Oh, uh, my folks bought us a house so thank you very much for the house. You're radiant, you're blessed, you're inspiring. Keep on shining with new Oradine Whitening Toothpaste and teeth strips. Our enamel protection technology allows you to eat whatever you want and keep smiling. Oradine. Wow! Look at you! Did you miss me? Mm. This is great. I think there's room for a flower bed out back.. ...near the pool. I'd like to plant some if that's okay. Oh, yeah? What kind of flowers? Tiger Lilies, Tulips, Morning Glories. Sorry, babe. One second. - I just gotta respond to this. - Okay. Sure. It's a great name for a flower, isn't it? Morning Glories. Like the glory of an awesome morning. I like mornings more and more these days. This house has great light. I feel so lucky. Hm? I feel so lucky. Hm. Ma, we're pregnant. Yeah. Yes. I know. I will. Ah.. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Just.. - Whoo! - There we are. Darling, what a day! - Yeah, yeah, this is fun. - Good news! - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. Look at this. The future CEO of our company, right here. Right here. I was in labor for 30 hours with Richie. He didn't wanna come out. He had it made in there. Thirty hours. And then, he was born blue. - Blue? - Slate blue. We all thought he was dead but then he started breathing and crawling. And sucking on the cat's tail. - What? - Yes. Yes. Uh, apparently, I prefer the cat's tail to my pacifier. The cat's tail was always wet. You know, Hunter was a crazy kid, too. Tell them about the, uh.. What was it? The... the guy on the side of the road who, uh.. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell it. - That's not... Do it. It's good. It's good. Come on. - This is great. - Ha-ha-ha! It's not really a story. Um, there was this guy kind of this local nutcase and he would stand on the side of the road into town and he would blow kisses at all the cars passing by. And at first, he scared me because he had this beard and dirty hair and bad teeth. Uh, it was like this religious calling or something. - He had to blow... - Oh, by the way, Richie.. Uh, before I forget, um, how was it left with the Carver people? They sent over the contracts and it's being e-signed because one of the partners is in Africa on a safari or something like that. As of when? I didn't know. I wasn't aware of this. - Apparently, he took the kid. - Really? - There he is.. - I didn't know about that. Closing the deal. Alright. Gotta keep up on these things. Yeah, I... I'll... I'll email him f... first thing Monday. - Okay. Good. - I'll get right on it. He's on safari. No, really. Oh, oh, well, if he's on safari... - No, I mean it. I mean it. - I know. - Okay, fine. - But he's, I mean, he's out.. It's not like you get internet. ...the Sahara somewhere. It's fine. I don't care. I don't think there's anything to worry about. Sorry. This ice is totally awesome. Mm! - Aah! - Sorry, darling. I let myself in. - You gave me such a fright. - Obviously. I just wanted to bring this over. Self-help book. I read it when I was pregnant and it really helped with the postpartum. Oh, my gosh. I love it. I'm making lunch. Grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup. - Can you stay? - Oh! - I wish I could. - I can make something else. No, no, no. Don't bother. I better be going. You would look so pretty with long hair. You should grow it out. Richie likes his girls with long, beautiful hair. What are you so happy about? I'm proud of myself. I did something unexpected today. What? You promise you won't laugh if I tell you? Promise I won't laugh. Uh.. ...the drapes I chose sky blue drapes for the theater. Oh. Cool. That's not so unexpected. You sure that's the right color, though? It's a little hipster. I think it works. And you said that I could choose. I did. And you can. Of course you can. It's up to you. I like unexpected. Come here. Do I make you happy? I'm the happiest man in the whole world. I love everything about you. Every little thing. You're not mad at me? About what? The drapes? I don't know. I just wanna make sure I'm not doing anything wrong. You're not. You couldn't do anything wrong even if you tried. Mm. Okay, okay, okay. Babe? Babe, did you iron this tie? Uh.. Yeah. It was wrinkled. You can't iron a tie like this. It'll permanently damage the silk. It has to be steamed. You see? Oh, shoot. I'm sorry. Do you have another tie you can wear? Not one that goes with this shirt. Fuck. Now what the hell am I gonna do? It's okay. New Medical evidence suggests that consuming your placenta after giving birth can level off your hormones, increase milk production and lower chances of postpartum depression. Your placenta can be dried out and converted into daily dietary supplements. Hi! Yeah. I'll be right over! Bye. Good. Great. I wanted to be an artist too, you know. - Really? - Mm. Well, an actress. Oh! I could see that. You're a knockout. Thank you. So are you. Thank you. So what did you do for money before you met my son? Retail, mostly. - Selling things in a shop? - Yeah. Selling what? - Toiletries. - Oh! Bubble bath, body wash. Soap. Well, lucky break you meeting my son. Yeah. I would go to these illustration job, um.. ...advertising interviews and, and it wasn't like they were gonna hire me anyway. I'm just real grateful.. ...to Richie and you guys for providing me some solid ground to stand on, you know? Plus I have so much free time now for drawing and whatever. The best advice anyone ever gave me was "Fake it till you make it." Are you a faker or have you made it? I'm sorry? Are you happy or are you pretending to be happy? I'm happy. - Hey. Hi. Hi, hi. - What's going on? No, no, no. No, no, I was.. Are you trying to convince us how drunk you actually are? - I got this. - I'm as sober as long as a.. Good thing I was the one to drive you over.. - Yeah, man. So sexy! - Yeah, get in there, my man. - Ow! - Let's go. Just a minute! Hey, babe? What's going on in there? What? What's wrong? You're trembling. Nothing. I'm okay. Mm.. - I'll be right down. - Okay. - Not a chance. Not a chance. - Get out of here. No way. No way. You're in cuffs. You don't even need a breathalyzer. You're in cuffs. You're done. You're done. Who's up next? Who's up next? Just like, just like you're back in boot camp there. What happened? - What? - You're damp. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, I'm Aaron. I work with Richard. I'm Hunter. I'm married to Richard. Congratulations. - For what? - The baby. Oh. Yeah. Hey, can I have a hug? - What? - A... a hug. W... will you hug me? Why? Because I'm not drunk enough to ask for a kiss. - I'm Richie's wife, remember? - So, it's.. It's just a hug. One hug, hon. I'm lonely.

I'm fine! - I'm... I'm right here! - I'm fine! - Hunter, I'm right here! What is wrong with you? Huh? Really. Really. I... I am trying to understand, alright? Why? Why? Why would you do something like this? I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? - I don't know. - You do. I don't know. I just.. I wanted to do it, and so I did it. Oh, that's a great excuse. I've never even heard of this pica thing. - Just stop raising your voice! - You know what? This is the kind of thing that you're supposed to tell somebody about before you get married. You should've told me about this. I didn't know about it! Oh, that's such bullshit, Hunter! Alright? Don't fucking lie to me like that! I'm so sorry. I've never done anything like this before. I can't, I can't help it. Shit! Damn it! Just what the fuck is wrong with you? These stupid fucking rocks. Yeah, sure. Just have me fucking paying for everything. That's fine. You don't know why. No, you're just sitting here at home all day making scrapbooks and picking out fucking curtains. Well, I would think medication first, right, Alice? I mean, just to settle her down. I don't wanna tell you how to do your job but I am paying for this, so results. We want results. I think it might be better if I met with Hunter alone for a bit. Ah, no. No, I... I'm gonna stay. Yeah, just to make sure that she's.. I'm okay. Really. - Alright. - Okay. We'll be right outside. Do you want to lie down? Can I just... have the medication? We can try Celexa or... or Wellbutrin. Sure. But talking is important, too. Are you reluctant to talk about your parents? It's just a waste of time. They were good to me. I had a normal childhood. My family loved me very much. End of story. I just wanna stop eating stuff so I can make Richie happy and we can go back to our life together. How does it make you feel when you swallow something? I don't know. Good, I guess. In what way? I just like the textures in my mouth. I like the way they feel in my mouth. Mattress stuffing.. ...ice, metal cold metal, especially. Junk like that. Does the pain bother you? Some of the objects you swallowed are, are quite sharp. Okay. Let's start juicing. We're gonna make you a daily fruit and vegetable drink with lots of iron. You see, your brain and your body are connected. But right now, your body's starving so it is sending the wrong signal to the brain about what it wants to eat. So we are going to reconnect the mind and the body. Yeah. Totally. Totally. Hey, babe. I'm gonna steal you for a second. - We're juicing. - Oh, yeah. There's somebody I want you to meet. Oh. - Come on. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - Come on. - Who is it? - Oh, you'll see. - He's just downstairs. - Oh. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Luay. - Hi, Louie. - Luay. Who is he? Luay's gonna be helping you out around the house. He's a nurse. A live-in nurse. He's great with memaw. Very sensitive. Doing what, exactly? I'm not a senior citizen. Look, I gotta work. I can't be here 24/7. So he's here to keep an eye on me? No, he's here as a resource. If you're tired, he can cook for you. He can go to the store and get you things. What, is he gonna be pulling stuff out of my hands? Okay, okay. Just relax, babe, okay? Mom? Mom, can you come and explain this, please? This was your idea and I just... can't deal with this right now. You know, I had help around the house when I was pregnant. It really takes the pressure off. Plus, you're still recovering from your little stay in the hospital. Honey, Luay is the best there is. Help us help you. Oh, I can do it. I can do it! Mr. Richie wants me to help you. I can cook just fine. I wanna cook my husband's dinner by myself. Go watch TV or something. Please. So where are you from? Damascus. Syria, not Pittsburgh. Why'd you leave? War. Oh. Where are you from? East Meredith. Upstate New York. No war there. Just trees and cows and farms and stuff. If you were in war, you would not have this problem of the mind. No time for mind problems when you're being shot at. I have to go to the bathroom now. Please, miss. You know what they want, okay? You know what I'm supposed to do. Okay, go. The hospital sent over a report detailing the contents of your stomach. It said you swallowed a battery. It's just so not a big deal. Everyone is making a big deal about it. Yes, I did some things that I shouldn't have. Well, a battery seems like a big deal. If it leaked inside your stomach the acid could've killed you. That concerns me. A needle, a rock, a battery. Why those objects? I don't know. It made me feel.. ...in control. Do you feel out of control? Oh, um, there was something that I wanted to tell you about, um.. ...my mom and our relationship and stuff. You know what? Never mind. Hunter. It's Richie's birthday. I really have to go. Bye. - Hi, birthday boy. - Hi, babe. - Hi, Hunter. Great party. - Hi, Sara. How are you? Great party. - Hi, Lauren. - Hi. - I love your dress. - Hunter.. I love what you've done with the place. Look at these sandwiches. They're hilarious. - Have one. - Oh, no, no, no. Get those away from me. If I eat anymore I'm gonna have to get my stomach pumped. Oh, my God. Hunter. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I didn't.. - I'm such an idiot. I didn't.. - What? I wasn't even thinking, and I just... No, no, no. Bev, Bev. Don't even, don't even worry about it. It's fine. It's fine. Really, it's okay. And we're doing great. Yeah, H... Hunter's made a lot of progress, and.. - Right. - Uh.. My mom's got her on a new diet. - Right? - Mm. What diet? Oh. Lots of... iron and fiber. - Mm. That's so healthy. - And fish and... - Right. - Right, right. Yeah. - You look great. - Doesn't she? - I know. I love diets. - Yeah. She made all my favorites. Yeah. I'd rather no one know. Well.. Are you mad at me? Hon, e... everybody here cares. They care big time. Y... your food's a big hit. It's a huge hit. You should be happy about that. Yeah. I can't believe you fucking told them. Okay, can you please not ruin my birthday? We'll talk about this later. - Hey. - Hey. Can I, uh.. Can I have a hug? I'm lonely. Are you okay, miss? Yes, thank you. Okay. Let me know if you need anything. I... I'll be right outside. Ow. I didn't finish. Say you're sorry.. ...for the party.. ...telling everyone at the office. I'm sorry. I am, honey. This hasn't been easy on me, either. I needed the support. Do you still love me unconditionally? Of course. Yes. Yes, I do. And I'm gonna try harder to understand to be more understanding. Okay. I love you too. I'm sorry I'm such a freak. But you're my freak. You're my little freak. Let's get back to your family for a minute. Why? I told you they were normal. In last session, you hinted at some type of issue with your mom. Oh, gosh. I guess you want me to tell you about the whole rape thing. What whole rape thing? Okay. If I tell you... if.. ...you have to promise that you're not gonna make a big deal about it. I promise. So my father isn't really my father. My mom was raped in the '90s by some random guy and I was the result, you know? Did they ever catch the guy? Yeah. He did time. William Erwin was his name is his name. Do you wanna see a picture of him? Oh, no. Not really. No, look. Look. That's him. Y... you carry that around with you? Yeah. I've dealt with it. How have you dealt with it? I've thought about it a lot. Did your mother ever consider terminating the pregnancy? My mom is... this right-wing religious nut. She's really sweet. My family doesn't believe in.. ...abortion even in the cases of incest or rape so here I am. But my stepdad was really nice to me. And my mom was never resentful or anything. My sisters love me. How did it happen? She went to a bar and he bought her a drink. My mom left and he followed her home and he broke in. That's all I know. Can we change the subject? I think this is important, actually. I think this might have a lot to do with your compulsion. Okay. We're at the end of our session. See you in a couple days. That color looks really nice on you. Oh, thank you. See you soon. I love you. I love you too. Mm. Come here. Beautiful! Hello? This is Richard. ...connected to her past. What do you mean about her past? I... I think her life is in danger. She can't overcome a guilt complex without your love and acceptance. No, no, no, no. What about her past? Please, you have to tell me. I can't say. Just ask her. Listen, we had a deal, okay? You're supposed to tell me everything. Everything. If you won't tell me, I don't want her seeing you anymore. It has to do with a rape. Hello? Are you there? Hello? No, I'm here. So as I understand Hunter's father raped her mother and she is the product of that crime. Mm-hmm. Did she say anything to you about this? Did she mention anything? No. No, I... I didn't know. No, I... I understand. Ah, there you are. I'm off to the gym. I'm... I'm gonna get you something today. Whatever you want. You want a... a dress or necklace? You name it, it's yours. Anything. A bracelet? Bracelet. Bracelet. Oh, okay. Done. Oh, shit. Oh, fucking shit. Holy shit. Shit. Hunter? You alright? I'm under the bed. Go away. You seem upset. No shit, Sherlock. Please come out. Mr. Richie wouldn't like this. No. It's very dusty here. Maybe I'll clean later. Maybe I'll clean the whole room. You're safe here. You're safe. Miss! Miss! No. Miss. ♪ Happiness is like a bird ♪ ♪ With 20 wings ♪ ♪ Try to catch him as he flies ♪ ♪ Happiness is like a bird ♪ ♪ That only sings ♪ ♪ When his head is in the skies ♪ ♪ You can try to make him walk beside you ♪ ♪ You can say the door is open wide ♪ ♪ If you grab at him ♪ ♪ Woe betide you ♪ ♪ I know because I've tried ♪♪ I really think it's a good idea.

Really, I am. I know I went too far. I know I did. It was just a game. A stupid game. - I know it went too far. - No. You have to go there so you can get better. And if she won't go, Richie wants a divorce. It's just seven months. So sign the paper, sweetie. Good. That's a good girl. Are we going now? Yeah.

Oh! - Thank you! - Sure. - Thank you! - Where are you going? Ah! Where are you? I just wanted to explain. I still have feelings for you, and.. And.. I think I rushed into some stuff to make you happy.. ...like where we live and.. ...the baby. - I wanted to make you happy.. - No. No, look. - And I just.. - Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Just listen, okay?

You can't do anything. This is it. This is the best it is ever going to get. Come back. You come back or I will hunt you down. I'll fucking hunt you down, you ungrateful cunt. Okay. I have to go. You get back here with my kid! Treasure the little things. I'll meet you on the train. No. I'm not going. What the hell are you talking about? Wait? Wait for what? For a sign. There are signs all around us hidden in the woodwork. You just have to know where to look. It'll tell you what you do it'll tell you who you are. I've never heard of anything so ludicrous in all my life. Well, go on. Stay here if you want. Sit here the rest of your life if you want to. I'm getting on that train. No, thank you. I'm checking out. Hi, mom. What's up? Hi, honey. Nice to hear your voice. Uh... listen. I need to come see you. It's kind of an emergency. Of course. It'll be good for us to spend some time together. Really? You want me to? Sure, doll. You're always welcome. It's just your sister's here with the new baby and it's a little bit crowded. Please? I won't get in the way.

Can I help you with some of this? - No, no, no. - Oh, no, no, no. It's just, you know.. No, that's okay. You don't have to. It's my pleasure. Oh, you really don't have to do that. It's no trouble at all. - Ah.. Yep. - Okay. Thank you. So Hunter, who invited you to the party? I, uh.. I.. You remember Jill McCoy, right? She's my mom. Lucy, do you have a recycling bin or something? Oh, yeah. I'll take those. It's under the sink. I'm sorry. Jill who? - McCoy. - She's an old friend of mine. I.. Well, I haven't seen her in years. Hey, Brat. Why don't you go and play with your pals. Oh, you never mentioned any Jill. Oh, uh.. - Jill. - Oh! Yeah. She, uh, she.. I, her mom, I went to high school with her. Yeah. Coming back to me now. I ran into Jill last week. She said that her daughter, uh, might you know, stop by the party. Or rather, she and her daughter. So I guess your mom couldn't make it, huh? No. No, she got held up. So, so, what do you want? Um, soda? You want p... punch? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Can I show Hunter my room? No. No, honey. You gotta go to bed. It's past your bedtime. Mm-hm. Oh, come on. Here. And you're in charge of the grill, okay? - Okay. Yeah. Alright. - We need burgers and hot dogs. Okay. Sure, babe.

I'm in charge, okay? Say it. Say it. Okay. You're in charge. Hey, where are those burgers? We're famished. Roger that! - Join us outside, kids. - Yeah. No, we'll be there in a minute. We're just.. Just.. - Can you give us a minute? - Okay. Okay. We're good. Why'd you do it? I can't explain that. That's.. I was delusional. I mean, there's no way to explain that. I... I was.. It made me feel special. A secret makes you strong, you know? Everybody thought I was this regular guy, you know but I was important inside. I was fucking powerful. I was God. And, um.. ...and then I went to jail and I got shit-bagged in jail. Yeah, they beat me so bad I had to wear a colostomy bag and then I realized who I was. I was not God. I was shit. Are you ashamed of me? No. But what I did.. ...I'm ashamed of that. Am I like you? I don't know. Are you? No. But I just need to hear you say it. You're not me. You.. You didn't do anything. You didn't do anything wrong. It's not your fault. Take one pill here wait 24 hours.. ...then place the remaining four pills in your mouth two in each cheek.
