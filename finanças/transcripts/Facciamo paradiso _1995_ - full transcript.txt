Milan, December 7, 1972. Once again, the grand opening of the season at La Scala, is bedeviled by the throwing of rotten eggs and tomatoes by protesters. WE'LL MAKE PARADISE Bourgeois! Losers! Go back to the sewers! Later, Fernando. It's terrible! Where's the police? They do nothing. I don't get it. The police do what they can. It's disgusting! Listen, let's turn back. - Yes, now I must change. I don't know if we'll come back. - Me neither. Let's go. - Wait a minute. Take this. Yes, thank you. Home, OK? - We're going home? Yes, let's go home. Claudia! I'm back home! Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. - Hi. Why didn't you let us know? Do you want me? I'm planning on staying a while. I think it's a great idea. Alfredo, this needs to go to the cleaners. You look heavier. - Because I'm pregnant. What's so weird about that? I'm expecting a child. I'm very happy. A baby. And naturally, I want to have it. When will it be born? - I don't know. I think in about 6 months. When it's warm, I want to go to Parrella, if you don't mind. So that… I can go by myself too. Whose baby is it? - I don't know. How could you not know? How is that possible? You don't know the father? No, Dad. Believe me, I really don't. Lately, I had been with 4 boys… Four? - Yes. Anyway, that's water under the bridge. I want to totally change my life. I want to be a full time mother. I gave the house on Margherita St to three of my friends. I think they'll put up a clinic there. Well? What do you think? Will it be a boy or a girl? I already signed up to a very interesting maternity course. But I don't want my child born around all those devices, all those tests. No, I'd like it to be born in the most natural way possible. For example, I don't want to know the sex. And I'd like it to be just like you, Mama, when I was born. In 1949, when Claudia was born on June 3rd, there were no ultrasounds, but Professor Breglia of the Saint Eufemia Clinic thought he had an unerring method of knowing the newborn's sex. And Mrs Bertelli went to him, who had assured her the birth of a boy. Crap, it's a girl! Thanks. I'm mortified. - No, don't. At the end of a war that caused the death so many men, bringing a boy into the world would be a bit banal, right? Anyway, a girl is fine. - Sure. Mange, ma petite, mange. It's good she learns languages. A baby's brain is like a sponge. They learn everything quickly with extreme ease. Drink, my baby. Drink your good milk. By the way, I'll have to unroll her from Cambridge. Really? - Yes, they don't want girls there. Don't be afraid, my baby. Anyway, you'll study in England. May I? Peace and good will. Am I bothering you? No, you can come in, Father. But let me tell you at once, we've already spoken to Sr Angela. We have no intention of baptizing the girl. I understand. You probably have your own priest. No, no priests in my family, don't be angry, Father. We Bertellis have been free thinkers since the time of Cavour. We'll never impose anything on our girl. When she's older, she can decide. December 9, 1956 Claudia! Dear, why are you on your knees? I praying for you sinners. In Italian. Excuse me, why do you say that? Because I want to go to paradise like all children, that's why! And not be the only one eaten by worms under the ground. And I want my guardian angel. Why does everyone get one but me? The Bertellis did everything in the quietest way possible. On his property in the country in Parrella on the Adige. I believe. It turned out to be a particularly moving ceremony. I want to do the same as our bosses. We'll baptize our child when he grows up. When they're little, it's not as satisfying. Accepted in 1963, at 13 years old, at Saint Mary School, Claudia proved to be a model student until June 2, 1966. The date on which the Bertellis received an urgent order to come get their daughter. Claudia was dishonorably expelled from the Institute. Claudia should have been expelled the day she declared she wouldn't attend Holy Mass since she had other interests. She took the crucifix from the head of the bed… and threw her uniform away. For the love of God and believing this a passing crisis, we were patient beyond all limits. Her latest act: The girl knew you would come today to get her, so she stole off to the Isle of Wight, dragging two other students with her. They had the good sense to come back and inform us. The Isle of Wight? THE ENGLISH CHANNEL September 20, 1966 I'll go see how mom is. Bring her out here. It'll pass if she gets air. And her fear of flying too. So, how are you? Better. Better. Were you able to talk to her? - Yes. We're fine: She agreed to continue her studies in Italy and promised to get her diploma in October. I'm pleased with her: Her mind is open to a changing world. And those horrible people on the island where she was? Are they communists? - No, they're no communists. They're hippies. They don't know what they want but… Did you ask her if she's still a virgin? Is she or not? I didn't ask! Claudia kept her promises. She got her high school diploma and on November 12, 1967, she enrolled in college. Faculty of Arts. On the left, the left. MILAN November 11, 1967 Professor Bellocchio's classroom? Stairway on the right, 1st floor. - Thanks. Professor Bellocchio's classroom? Over there, after the corner. Is this Professor Bellocchio's classroom? - Yes. Has the professor arrived? - I am the professor. Excuse me. Can't we go in earlier? Yes, you can go in. I'm the one who can't. They said when they're ready, they'll call me. Go on. Come on, guys, move it! Hey, who's helping me? - Throw the dais over there! Give me a hand! - I'm coming! The chairs! - More towards the back, guys! Will you make me a circle with these seats in front? I said a circle! - Hey, you! Hey, help me move the desk! - Hurry up! Where do we put it? - Calabrone, help them! Come on, I'll help you. Are you new? - Yes. Freshman? - Yes, and you? Do I look out-of-course? More in the center, so one can pass. In the center! Come over here! Get a chair and come here! A chair? - Take this! Take… hey! Thanks. This is fine. Calabrone, let him in. Professor, you can come in. Sit down. Does the classroom's new set up shock you? Nothing shocks me anymore. - Good. As you see, we abolished the lectern as the center of attention and power. Now the seats are equal, Professor: Yours and ours. I disagree. Because I'm getting a draft on my neck here. He's getting a draft! We'll agree to rotate seats from now on, OK? I agree. But let me warn you: I must still be the center of attention. Because I am the instructor and you are the pupils. I know everything about Romance philology… and you don't know shit. Clown! You're a clown! - You stink! Animal! - Be quiet! Silence, guys! That's enough! It's true. You're the teacher and we're the students. And that's why you're at our service. Or at the service of the society we represent. We want to choose and discuss the topics we'll go over. Those that will be helpful in our professional lives. What's so funny? Nothing. Because if you go on like this, there'll be no professional life. Shut up! - Animal! Sell out! - Beast! We want to run the university. We don't give a crap about running it with the academic authority! University is for those who use it. Power to the students! Student power! Student power! Bye, guys. Then you'll contact the printers? - Sure. We need 2000. - Tomorrow at 5 am. Don't forget, guys. Bye. See you tomorrow. - Bye. See you tomorrow! - Tomorrow! Hey, excuse me! - Hi. I forgot my umbrella. I'm so silly. You shoulda said so. Where are you going? Here, I take the 22. And you? - No, I take 64. That Lucio is really smart, eh? - Lucio? Lucio is… but wait, the best is yet to come. I thought I was going to study. But these days you can't just study. Here comes 64. You must go. Don't worry. I'll wait for yours. It's raining. Don't go to any trouble. - No, it's raining… OK, but get next to me. C'mon. What can I give you? What? Ah, this! Claudia, you must read this. It's… Marcuse! Lucio says that it's really… one of the fundamental things of liberation thought, you see? Interesting. - Thanks. And then there's this. You'll want to read this. It is Chairman Mao Tse Tung's little red book. Get off now. I feel guilty. Go on! No, I'll go with you. - You will? Besides, Lucio always says that indoctrinating the new ones is one of our main tasks. Lucio say this, Lucio says that. Don't you ever say anything? We have the same ideas but he says them better. Close it, it stopped raining. Sorry, I'm so careless. What happened to your eye? Oh, it was nothing. When I was little, my 5 year old sister tried to kill me with a screwdriver and damaged the nerve a bit. Would you like to do a committee with us? A committee? Me? You bet! Which one? There are many: the Technical Committee, the University and Community, I don't know. What committee is he on? Who? Lucio. No, but he supervises a little bit of all of them. Well, I don't know. What do you think I'd be best at? You'd be ideal for printing and pamphlets. Printing and pamphlets? Great, I'd love that! Thanks. It's my parents. Come, I want to introduce you. Come on! Claudia… - Don't be silly! I'd be embarrassed… How did it go, dear? - Great. This is my comrade, Mr Calabrone. Patané. Pino Patané. "Calabrone" because I'm from Calabria and a bit dark. Engineer Bertelli. My wife. Mr Calabrone's getting me on a committee for the Fight. Nice. Can we give you a ride home? Go on! Ma'am, Engineer… See you tomorrow. - Bye. A committee to fight against whom? - Everybody, dear. Particularly against people like us. Haven't you heard of the student movement? - They're communists. God, Mom, what do you know about communists? Please! I heard you call him "comrade". - Comrade? So what? Nothing, dear. You're right. That means schoolmate, right? It's so cold! What are you doing around the fire? Are you waiting for the siren to go off? Are you moving or not? - These are all wrong! Give them here. Put these on the scooter for Pirelli. - These too! These too? OK. C'mon, guys, we don't have much time! The guys on the bike go to Marelli? - Yes! Let's go now! - Damn, it's cold! Come on, hurry up! - Go on! Pino! Pino, can you tell me what's going on? We had a setback. There was a mistake. Yeah, some mistake! We'll look like shit to the workers. Instead of wasting time, let's go talk to Marelli. We still have time. Let's go! No, Claudia, you come with me! Will you explain this to me? - I'll show them to you. Come. You see what it says? The students will "fart" instead of "fight." What will the workers think of us? But you are completely frozen. Well, yes, we've been here since 4. Don't you have a pair of gloves? Yes, I had. But I dropped them over there. No, don't worry about it! Come here. Are you the newby? - Yes! You look cute dressed like an English hippie. That's where I came from. Guys! You go ahead. We'll join you later. We can have a nice hot chocolate. Or even punch. A hot punch is just what you need. That's the first. Guys, if you hurry, you'll get to Pirelli. We'll come later. Put this on, it's cold. Then you speak English? - Yes, English, some French and German too. - Then I'll take you with me. I'm a dud with languages ​​and I need them because… we have contacts everywhere. That'll be important for us. UNIVERSITY OCCUPIED What we'll do is occupy the university right away. Here's the translation you asked for. I made 6 copies. We can't think of Parini. We just have to all agree. We can't occupy it by ourselves. Let's do this: Let Law and Architecture know. Just be careful of Engineering. Lucio, we must put something else on the agenda because Parini is taken. We must participate! Organize something! Think about a march! - Good idea. Yes, a march. - I need to sleep. Let's say, 7 minutes. Get up. - We'll talk later. Bye! - 7 minutes, OK? Claudia! Can you pass me my coat? Wake me up. - I'll go for some notes. 7 minutes. Here! Here's your coffee. I'll leave it here, OK? No, stay here. Tell me something. About what? I don't know, whatever. The article you just read. I like your voice. Well then, I read in Le Monde that in Nanterre… where the Minister is also, Daniel Cohn-Bendit said… Yes? You see, he said… He accused him of not knowing… Anyway, what I wanted to say is that even the students too… we should take up… to deal with the problem of the sexual question. Which shouldn't be a problem anymore. That's right. And how did they formulate the petition? Did the article say so? No, it didn't. The French students, men and women… Men and women? Then what'll we do? - We must absolutely occupy it! If we agree, we can't do it alone! NO TO POLICE VIOLENCE REPRESSION IS THE SONG OF THE BOURGEOIS SCHOOL I want to talk to Lucio Mioni. Who are you? - His sister Lucia. Reason for the visit? - Minestrone. Picket to Lucio. Over. Lucio, your sister's here. Over. Yes, minestrone. Send her up? Send her up? Over and out. If you go back there, he'll appear out of the 2nd window. FORBIDDEN TO FORBID Hi, Lucia. - It's still hot. Leave it by the door. - But it'll be eaten! No, I'll send someone I trust. Thank mama, eh? Wait! We want to know when you're coming home. I don't know, we're going to the bitter end. - Where? Yeah, OK. See ya! Government of Italy, thank you. Because pissing isn't taxed. And to make a shi… a shi… a song, you don't need a seal of approval. And we'll eat bread and mortadella, so we can always get an erection. And in this healthy and beautiful country, there's always a heavy tax. Government of Italy, thank you. Because pissing isn't taxed. And to make a shi… a shi… a song, Tomorrow, we'll see if our press release was published. And Belleri's article in the "Corriere." We need support, guys. A good soup. Did your mom make it? Yes, but I talk and you eat. Slow down with that spoon. - Yummy. If public opinion's with us, the police will think twice before using force. And the TV? I went yesterday. They promised to send a camera. And what's more, we bless you, because we don't pay taxes to get laid. And it's no big secret, that you always put us behind. What are you smoking? A joint. Some other time, eh? And somewhere else. But not here! And this applies to everyone! Did you hear? The revolution isn't made with joints! Must I write it on the wall? What department are you in? No department. I don't study. What are you doing here? Who let you in? Marco. - What Marco? Who is her Marco? Marco? Marco! Here I am. Did you let her in? Let me explain: She's Swedish and was evicted. I found her yesterday in the Galleria. If I didn't bring her here… someone else would've picked her up, eh? But you know if they find grass, we'll be in serious trouble. Excuse me, but how could she know, the poor thing? From now on, you take care of it. The responsibility is all yours! Alright, I'll take care of it. What's going on? - The electricity! This is all we needed! Lucio! There's light in the other houses! And on the street too! Did a fuse blow? No, I know what happened. Pigs, sons of bitches! They cut the electricity. They left us in the dark! Get out the matches and make light! All together, as in Verona! Michelle, ma belle, without light, you're even more lovelier, hammer and sickle. With Marx and Lenin. Tous ensemble against the cops. The cops. I love you, I love you, I love you Will you be with me or not? Hey? - Yes? I wanted to tell you something. - Go on. Not here. I found a place where we can be alone. Michelle, ma belle, without light, you're even more lovelier, hammer and sickle. With Marx and Lenin. Tous ensemble against the cops. The cops. I love you, I love you, I love you Let me by! What's wrong? Aren't you singing? - I don't feel like it. Here remains the clear, the endearing transparency, from your dear presence, Commander Chè Guevara. A nice retreat. 7 minutes? Tell me that thing. OK, but close your eyes, eh? Well, at the London school, with my classmates… we talked and thought about the first time. Some of us had already done it. Some were good, some bad… in order to liberate themselves. Some others, like me, we decided to do it... as soon as possible… but… with the right person, whom we could fall in love with. So… open your eyes now. I chose you because I love you. I can't. It seemed like rape to me. Not to me. Damn! Kids, this is Deputy Commissioner Anselmi! Do not resist the forces of order! Come out in a disciplined way following our orders! Let go of me! Let go of me, you sons of bitches! Let him go, you slobs! Let go of me, murderers! Damn fascists! And Lucio? Where is Lucio? No, they already released him. He's free but it's better he doesn't come around. Why? They freed him. Yes, but the police booked him: Outrage and resisting arrest. And his father said it's better he leave Milan for a while. And where do I find him? Can I call? But I must speak to him. It's important. Fine, I'll tell him. No, I must tell him myself. Where is he? I don't know. Yesterday, he was at a relative's house and today he said he'd call me at lunch time. It's late and I must go. - No! Wait, I must tell him something, please! Listen for a moment. Listen… the other night, the night of the occupation… when the police came… something happened, I behaved a little… I don't want Lucio to think that… I must talk to him! Understand? Hey you! It's Emily. The Swede. Do you know anybody who could take me in for a few days? I still don't know anyone here. Maybe a room where we can share expenses. Where do you live? - I live with my parents, sorry. If you know of someone, let them know. Hey, Pino! Where have you been? Tell Lucio to call me! You hear me? It's important! Hello? - Is Engineer Bertelli in? No, he's not. Sorry. If you'd be so kind, can you tell me…? Hello? Hello, is Lucio there, please? I'll go see. She's calling again. I'm not in. No. - Is that Claudia? Claudia should know about the meeting. Calabrone, I'll look after Bertelli. You look after today's agenda, OK? I've already prepared the agenda. She asked me to let her know… Why don't you call her? - I will! Boys, tell everybody there'll be a sit-in. Please, at the usual spot. - OK. Goodbye, ladies! Everything was delicious. Thanks! What's the matter? Do you feel sick? You're very pale. I noticed it yesterday too. Is something wrong? A disappointment in love! How tiring! Every 5 minutes. Tell them every 5 minutes. It is we, we who must follow their example. They have put a regime in crisis, paralyzed a country like France… - Ah! My suitcase! Make contact with those of "The Fight Continues," but not compromise on anything. Do you know where you gotta go? - No, we don't. Anybody expecting you? - No. Nobody's waiting for you? - Pino! Pino, are you listening to me? Yes, "The Fight Continues," make contact but no compromises. Please, hold it. - OK, give it here. The Claudia "Chapter…" You must tell Claudia… - Yes? Pino, be honest: Do you like Claudia? Forget about her, idiot. She's not for us. Pino! You know nothing! Don't tell her anything! Not even where I am! I got it! - Bye! - Fine! You're a good friend. Thanks. - Hey! You here too? I had to run to pick up some of my dad's countrymen. And nobody has a car! - What countrymen? You came to bring Lucio to the station. He left. Everyone in the leadership knew except me. It's not my fault. Lucio asked me not to tell you anything. And what did I know? I didn't know anything. Fine. Bye, I'll explain later. - No, wait! Claudia! Claudia, I'll go with you in my car, OK? Then I'll call you! No, I'll call you! - When? Mom, the cold milk is here. Thank you, dear. I'm no longer a virgin. Really? And since when? Since yesterday. And did this happen with Lucio? No, with Pino. With Calabrone? With him? Why him? Excuse me, how is it possible? I knew you'd say that. Because you come from racists! Disgusting racists! Not that! You told us he was the son of immigrants! That they got it into their heads to get a degree for an idiot who hasn't been able to graduate for 10 years! Not true. He's very smart and nice! And I hate you both! I hate you! Claudia. Claudia. Come here a moment. - You come! Claudia! - What will I do now? What do you want? - Come here! For one moment. Do you know the professors are refusing to give exams? Yes, I know but that's not why… Your father called me. He invited me to dinner. Is he crazy? And you? What could I say? Nothing. I thanked him and… Wha… Come, come here! - No. My… hand… - Come over here. You're hurting my hand. My hand! Shut up! Sit here. What were you thinking? Your father invited me. Why ask me? I'll tell them myself that you can't. Why? Do they know about us? - Of course. I told them! Then I'm obliged to go. I must tell him. I know what my responsibilities are. I know my duty… - What the hell is in your head? The responsibility for what happened between us is mine alone. And I already told my parents that I want to live on my own. With me? - On my own! Once I'm settled, I'll invite you over. Any news of Lucio? He called me last night. You told him about us? - Hey! But… Why not? That was a big mistake. Look, Engineer Bertelli, this is the back of the house. Those are the bedrooms. Yes, we know the house well. It belongs to us. We left it to our daughter Claudia. Your daughter rooms with a friend? Well, pay attention. This is your daughter… and back on the bed, if you look well, you can see… Look: There's her friend. What friend? - A certain Emily, half… Swedish. Wait, I'll show you. Look, it would've sucked even with the love of your life. All the first times sucks. With my first joint, I threw up like crazy. And the first time, I made love to my cousin… who wasn't as ugly as your friend Calabrone, I wanted to bang my head against the wall in disgust. But now, I really like to smoke joints. And I really like sleeping with all the men. But no love nonsense. I sleep alone. I take them when I feel like it and get rid of them when it's over. You do the same. It's worth it. But she's smoking? - So? She smokes and nothing else. As I already indicated, even as my collaborator indicated, there's a continuous buying of drugs by… Drugs? - Well, soft ones, OK? Soft. They're drugs! - Soft ones, Alda. Soft. Does she have any relations with boys? - A few. Yes, with young students. She has some casual relations. Let me show you. It's an excellent machine but… it's difficult to… but… I haven't got it by heart yet… There! This is a certain Romolo Rinforzi. - Rinforzi. Rinforzi, yes. A temporary physician. Is he from Milan? - No, Florence. There's also another but we only filmed two because the technology is fantastic but expensive… Wait, there he is. I'll also show you your daughter. Livio Tricomi. They had a brief "concubinage" together. But… um… she at least goes to the university? Him? Yes, he's out-of-course. - No, I don't mean him. Her. Ah, her? Not much. One exam in an entire year. But you must consider she was very dedicated to the movement. To the student movement? No. Feminism. Feminism? Feminism. Wait, I'll show you. We have material on that too. Hey, wait! What the…! This is the rally from the 19th. Tremble! Quake! The witches are back! Look well… And there she is! See her? And you can see her later. I'll show it to you right now. Yeah, the police are there too. There she is! What is this… um…? Oh, nothing. I'll explain it to you later. Please, continue. Go on. - Everything is in the report. Things were at this point, when on the night of December 7th, at the opening of the season at La Scala, the Bertellis returned home finding their daughter Claudia. I'm back home! - And when will it be born? I don't know. I think in about 6 months. That's water under the bridge. I want to totally change my life. I want to be a full time mother. I already signed up to a very interesting maternity course. And in the months that followed, Claudia kept her word. Excuse me, I need to clarify a few things. First: How long after fertilization or the interruption of the menstrual cycle can the danger of an ectopic pregnancy be excluded? Second: At what stage of pregnancy are the genitals modified with a purplish tint and the appearance of capillaries in the aureole of the nipples. Third… Claudia gave birth on November 16, 1973 at the Santa Eufemia clinic, where she was born 24 years before. Professor Breglia had been succeeded by Dr Enrico Calonghi. Engineer Bertelli, the doctor wants you. It's coming. All went well. A boy, 3090 kilos. Did you expect it, Engineer? My God! We… We're not racists. - No, not at all. Well then, now you know who it was. Yes, but he left for Ghana. Well, I imagine you'll leave the flowers here. - Sure. The suitcase is in the car. I'll go to the administration, get the bill and then join you. Listen, I wanted to warn you, you know, concerning your mother, you know her, so little makes her happy, she will tell her friends, well… that you adopted the child. Really? And you agreed? About what? Ah, the adoption? Yes. It's a formality. What does it change? Well, see you in the car. - Yes, go on. Would you check it, please? - Oh, please! You must sign here. - Thank you. Excuse me, would you be so kind to give this to the nurse? Of course. - Thanks. My good wishes to your wife. - I'll tell her. No, we're waiting for my daughter. - The young lady left. What? - She left. I saw her take a taxi from which two gentlemen got out. Ah, my God! February 12, 1975 Claudia! Calabrone! What are you doing? What's going on? Many things: I quit school, had a son, moved in by myself. Now I sell lottery tickets. Here, it's the last of the pack. It's lucky. 1000 lire? Where…? - C'mon, a 1000 lire! Where are you going now? - Wherever you want. Want me to give you a ride? - Yes. I hafta go a 1000 places but Porta Romana would be great. We'll take you anyplace you like. Tell me where and I'll bring you, don't you worry. How are your parents? You see, I don't see them much… - Hold on, we're leaving! Help! This is scaring me! Anyway, I decided I don't want anyone's help. Wasn't I right? Hi - Hi. He isn't you son, is he? - No, my son isn't even two. I must go pick him up at daycare. We'll take the bus. We've already done 30, let's do 31. Don't worry, I'll go with you. He's the son of a friend who is my neighbor. He used to come to this school but he moved and must come here. I have to take him to physical therapy. - Let's go. Will you go with me? The therapy is near my house. You go back and forth every day? - To shop but not every day. Can you do it? - Come with me. I do it only when his mother, who works in the hospital, works nights and sleeps during the day, you see? In exchange, when she works during the day, because she works both shifts, If she work at night, she sleeps during the day. When she works during the day, it works out for me. Will it stall? Don't you worry. It will last 'til the end of time! Hold on tight, OK? How fast you're going! - If I don't, it turns off. Damn it! It had to happen now… Here he is. You didn't tell me he was black. He's beautiful. Hi! I shouldn't caress him or I'll get him dirty. You hear what he said? Thank you. We thank you. Listen, we live up there. On the 7th floor, no 37. My friend Vincenza has a phone. Vincenza Danieli. Can you remember her name? Listen, I gotta go make dinner and pick up Mario from therapy. Bye! - Claudia, wait! If you ever need anything… - I know. I'll visit your kiosk tomorrow! No, that was the last ticket! Bye! Bye… 6 x 9? - 53. 54. Why? Because if you do 6 x 10, you get 60. If you subtract 6, you get 54, right? You're confusing him! That's not at all true! You understood, right? Not much. - Exactly. Tomorrow the lawyer wants us all in court. Her closing argument in the Campigli case. No, I must bring the kids to school tomorrow. Then to unemployment. That's why I shopped tonight. Then go to unemployment office first and then to the court. Alright. - Look, it's important, eh? We must represent the movement. Friday night, a chapter meeting. I'll prepare the bowls. While it cools down, I'll get dressed. What a soft thing I made! I think it's getting late. Claudia! Listen, Claudia, I'll leave the door ajar. Mario! - Yes? Here! Go on! Eat now, understand? I'll wake her when I'm back. A fruit salad? One moment. What stuff! Always minestrone? Is there nothing else? Here. What would you like? - A little stew, thanks. What will you have? - What's the first course? Do you want more? The court awards the defendants Diego Zaccarelli, Giacomo Franchi, Gianfranco Baldassare and Alberto Petranzana the benefit of provisional liberty. And orders their immediate release… This is an indecency! Shame! Look! They raped them a second time! Shame! Silence! Silence or I'll have the room cleared! Clowns! The session is over! Silence! Silence! Damn fascists! Get your hands off me! Will next week's meeting be at the train station toilet? Claudia! The lawyer's here. You're right but you said expect it today and we did our best. We couldn't use the washing machines for 2 weeks. Is there anybody else who can sign? Who doesn't have any pending cases or convictions in the past. Yes. Claudia, call Masotti and Bini too. We never saw her here, right? - OK. The more, the better. You have a document, right? Yes, it's upstairs. You want to come to my place? But we can't all go in with the children! Please! - Let's go anyway! Let's go. - Let's just hurry. Would you take care of Albertino? Be careful. Sure. Now then, let's be clear that we will lose the case. But how? - It'll cause the stir we need right now. Let's be honest: The movement is in decline. The press is entirely against it, at least… Since when? "L'Unita," Rossanda! Fine, preaching to the choir but let's be serious, please! Never has there been so much talk about women in Italy as right now. We have successful Italian women: Managers, winners but… they're like men. The image, the appearance of a woman is never that of the real woman. The image… Well? What are you laughing at, idiot? - Well? A woman? Have you all looked in the mirror? So beautiful, fresh and young! Please. Excuse me, if I may, we're in a laundry room! Excuse me, then we need a good law, OK? No. 1: At least once a week, a visit to the hairdresser's. No. 2: A nice evening dress once a month. No. 3: High heels for when we march. Mandatory! Listen, girls, I've no time to waste! See you in court on Monday! Bye, Councilor, see you later. - Bye. The lawyer wasn't wrong, eh? She talks about our image but what can we do? We have children, a job, a commitment to the movement. Yes, but sometime we could have a little fun too, right? You know when I was a girl I really loved to go dancing. I always went dancing with my boyfriend, later my husband. Would you believe that after that we never went dancing again? Then after my son came trouble and he left me for another and I got a job at the hospital. Who goes dancing anymore? I'll take you, eh? Are you in? Do you all want to go? No, sorry, but we can't. Oh, no! Who would I leave my kid with? What about the hospital? I'll fill in for you at work. Go on and dance, don't worry. I know a guy who could watch the kids. If we don't do this now, we never will. Come on, please! Let's go to "Trident" which is an amazing place! Then you're sure? We'll go? - Yes! Bring the kids to my apartment at 9:30 sharp, OK? Agreed! - Wear your best, eh? Where are my shoes? - In the kitchen, no? Come on, hurry up! - Wait! Anita! - Open the door, please! A man! With a beard! It's Calabrone! Oh, hi! How are you? - Hi. Thank you. For me? - Yes. Come on in. It's a bit messy but pay no attention. We all had a little to drink. This is Vincenza. - We met a while back. And Mario. - Hi, Mario. That's Maddalena. And there is Teresa. That's her son Ivan. I'm going to fill in for Vincenza. Why would he care about that? - I'm just saying! The bell rang. - It's Anita. I'm outta here. - Who are you? How elegant you are! - Good evening. This is like a bus at rush hour! Whoa! How are you? - Good. Want a glass of wine? No, thanks. I don't drink. Come, now I'll explain. - Coming. Here you go. - I don't drink. Did you bring your pajamas? - Try them on. Get back. I said nothing to not scare you but the kids are very good. There were supposed to be 6 but Teresa isn't coming. I'm sorry. - What did you bring? Fruit? Thanks! I'll give it to the kids. No, don't give them anything. - I won't. Try to get everyone to sleep in this big bed. But will they go? - How do I look? If they wait, I'll go too! - No, dear, it's too late. Wow, you're mean! Can we go now? - Are you waiting for me? Mario, please behave yourself. Remember you're the oldest. Be nice to that man who was very kind to come to babysit you. Can I have the keys, Vincenza? - Bye, Mom! I'll leave you Vincenza's keys. If you need to call, go there. And if you hear it ring, go answer, OK? Did you get all that? - Yes, but where are you going? When will you be back? - But we're drunk, right? We're going dancing! - Yes, but where? When we get back, we'll tell you everything. Bye! You know how to ride a bicycle with wheels? Well? What games do you know? What games do I know indeed? Girls, I came too! Wow, you're dressed up! Claudia! 5! There's 5 of us! Lucio? Claudia. Just imagine: Pino's at my place! - Who? Pino… - Ah, Calabrone. How is he? I haven't heard from him in ages. - Don't you live in Milan? No, in Rome. My uncle is a friend of Craxi. I am at RAI. Don't let them pass you. 5, please. - That'll be 25. Here you go. That's only 20. - Ah, right. Bye! - Bye. Here you go. - Thanks. Is he a friend of yours? Yes, I know him. Shall we go? Hey. Who taught you that? Everybody's having fun and you need to ask questions. I saw it in an old movie. That's all. Look at her! You see that it's true? We can dance by ourselves too! I'm jumping in. Bye! C'mon, let's go for a turn. Maybe we'll meet someone we know. You go, I'll wait for you here. I understood something about you. I made them… I made something. The dance of the rolls. They had a lot of fun. And you? Didn't you have fun? - No. It made me sad and gave me a heAldache. One couldn't breathe in there. It's beautiful outside, you know? It looks like spring. Well, on Sunday we could take the children outside, we could go to the lake in the country. Yes, we'll see. Come on, let's go. You must be tired too. Come. Vincenza went to the hospital. And Anita collapsed. Anyway, don't worry, I'll take the kids tomorrow. Thank you, you were truly our salvation. Thanks again. Goodbye. Lucio was there. Asshole. Maybe he always was. Oh, woe is me! A prisoner in this gloomy dungeon! And away from my beloved! O, Rambaldo, my hero! Come quickly to save me from the cruel one who tore me from your love! The princess! - It's his voice! My adored! Come quickly to me! I am here for you, my princess! I'll tear you from that savage! Nothing will ever separate us! Here I am, reckless caitiff! You'll pay with your life for your daring! Look at the sword. - My sword will speak for me! Heaven! Protect this noble spirit! Rambaldo! Die, black dog! It's nothing. Come now! He wasn't talking to you, Albertino! Can I get him something? A lollipop? Yes, but hurry up. My heart will be yours forever! Do not fear, now you're in my arms! My horse will take us to your father, the King's castle! Hello, person. Hello. What are you doing here? Scenery and music. Were you the one who were singing? If you are here and I'm here… it's something that has already happened. And we can only accept it even if it's a bit strange. Then take him back to meet the puppets. He will like it. Thank you. But who are you? Call me Aldamo. See you later. Who was that? I don't know. A person. I met him at the "Trident." - The "Trident?" And "see you later", why? I don't know. Forgive me if I allowed myself to insist, but it was important for him to realize… that they weren't real people but effigies. Being aware is the only way to penetrate deeply into things. If you penetrate deeply, into a drop of water, you are in an ocean. Is that not true? One drop is the ocean. You speak like an oriental. Lately my reading has stumbled upon that culture. But I am a Jew. I can't do without… that God with an unspeakable name, about whom nothing can be said, not even if he exists. Then there are the prophets, the Marx brothers, the artichokes… - What? Nothing, it's late. Go pay then. - I'll pay, I got it. Sorry, it's getting late. Who is he? A friend. He loves you. Listen, I… I'd like to talk more with you. But not now. Can I visit you? - Of course. Most of my life is carried out in the theater library. That's my habitat. - Can we go? Bye. - Bye. I've paid! Come here, Albertino. Now let's go home, eh? But is your friend normal? Is he normal? May I come in? Is anyone here? May I? Is anyone here? - I wasn't expecting you so soon. Can I help you with something? It's nice here. It smells good. It is the perfume of thought. Listen, I'm making some pasta. I can make more. You want to eat with me? No, thanks. I can't. I have work in 20 minutes. You live here? No, I live in Navigli. I work here. Say, can you pass me the salt, please? That jar there. Yes, that one. Sit down, Claudia. I know you'll be surprised that I came to you. We hardly know each other but… I wanted to ask you for advice on some of my concerns, of which I haven't told anybody. The other day, you were a great comfort to my son. I wanted to thank you for that. It's fine to say, "We're not racists. We're all the same, all brothers." But as my son gets older, I see that things are difficult for him, a child of color. Claudia, colors are an optical illusion. So much so that animals and people, perceive them in different ways. But society is made by men. Man is an unfulfilled project. It's not men you should be worried about, Claudia. The problem is not him, the problem is you. Believe me. It's you. You want to make your life the masquerade you believe it, but you have no right to involve your son. Why a masquerade? We all wear masks. Do you what the word "person" means in Latin? Mask. We all wear masks to hide the person inside. I know who you are. But I don't want to talk about you or your choices. But I will say this: You are the ruin of your son. He was born in privilege and you want to take it away. You have no right. You can stay away from your family. Maintain your independence, if that makes you feel fulfilled, but allow him the privileges of the family you come from. What should I do? Leave him with his grandparents! And then come back, if you want. And your dark thoughts will vanish like clouds in the wind. In that year also, Engineer Bertelli and his wife called Claudia to spend a vacation with them. To their surprise, Claudia accepted, but only for the boy. Come, Albertino. You want to go to grandma? Last year, my daughter lost a baby and wanted to adopt another. He's a love, isn't he? He's a boy from Biafra. We're very sensitive to these issues. No, absolutely not. I'm awake. No, I swear it. I can't hear you, speak louder. I can't speak any louder or I'll wake someone up. Dad, I must tell you something very important. I may have found the man of my life. Claudia! I'm crazy with joy! Listen, he's an extraordinary man. He's a philosopher, very intelligent, he's very nice, he's extraordinary! Why don't you have him meet us? I can't. I can't so soon, eh? He's not one to get married just like that. He's extraordinary. I really got to hang up now. Bye, Dad. - Bye. It's a new guy. Who were you talking to? - With my father. But you're my real father. Tonight it was as if I had been reborn. I know all women say that. But it's like you were my first. That's why they call me Aldam. And me Eve. And this is the earthly paradise, the Garden of Eden. As long as the Almighty does not cast us out. A short time later, on September 6, 1977, in that same room facing Navigli, after showing him a positive pregnancy test, Claudia said to Aldamo, Do you have any scruples against marriage? Ours? Of course. Claudia, I am so passive, I don't know, nor do I want to know what will happen. That is why I'm so open to be ready to accept whatever may happen. Even my marriage with you. Claudia let some time pass before presenting her fiancé to her parents. Congratulations! Your health. Claudia, how many months are you? The 8th month, Mom. Claudia, there's something I still don't understand. You already brought into the world a lovely colored boy and everything was done very simply. I'd even say with a certain ease on the part of everyone. But now I've the impression you are seeking to have a "shotgun" wedding. Yes, I don't understand why you need to. We are very open minded. Why, Claudia? Because it's not a "shotgun" wedding. In fact, it's a love match. That one only has once in a lifetime. With or without the consent of the parents. And when do you plan to marry? - As soon as possible. Alright, but please not in Milan. You remember how well your baptism went in the country house with Don Guido? No, Mom, in Milan. At the town hall. Aldamo is a Jew. That too? - Alda! Please. Fine, kids, let's talk seriously. Tell me how does this new nuclear family plan to live? Excuse me, but it seems obvious you're not swimming in gold. Well then, what I propose is something simple, direct and honest: A good position in one of my companies. With a substantial salary, a long-term contract, which will you give you right away a certain security. I thank you but I cannot accept. And why? I am in theory opposed to security. I have 3 modest jobs. But I love them because they let me live. And they provide me with the necessary insecurity. Whoever is alive must live alone in insecurity. Any effort to live safely is to reject adventure, life. If you are safe, you're dead. And vice versa. See, Mom, isn't he extraordinary? However after a long discussion, he accepted 7 stores in Via Mascheroni in his wife's name. An income from the electric company on behalf of the baby, and a monthly check for the reimbursement of expenses. You're my only friend and you don't want to be the best man? I wouldn't be any good. I couldn't. Are you kidding? Come on, don't tell me no. Yet I will! I'll say it! No! No! No! No! I won't be the best man! No! That… was to help you for one night! Not for eternity! Not even a kiss for good luck? She didn't forego a white dress, despite being in the 9th month of pregnancy. I, Luigi Viganó, council member, pronounce on behalf of the law, that Mr Aldamo Disegni and Mrs Claudia Bertelli here present are united in marriage. Congratulations. Thank you. May you have much happiness. - A lovely ceremony! So nice. Mom! - Claudia! What are you thinking, Mama? - Did you see, Albertino? Thanks. Stupendous! - Claudia! Emily! Hi! - You see, I did it. This is Stefano. A pleasure. - We're together but it's a rough time now. Not because of money but politics. I wanted to ask about that place you were with your boy. Can you let us have it for a while? Sorry, but I left there a long time ago. But I can ask Aldamo. He could lend you his house in Navigli. It's very nice. Wait. Aldamo, excuse me, Emily wanted to know if we could lend them the house in Navigli. Of course, with pleasure. - Alright then. What's wrong? - My God, no! What's the matter? - What is it, dear? She's in labor, hurry! - No, wait a second! I'm sorry! It had to be today… Careful. - Damn it! Careful. - And where are we going? We must call the clinic. - Be calm. Ask for Dr Calon. Slowly, please! Slowly, slowly! Get in. Why did it have to be today? Be careful with the dress! Quick, to the clinic. - Yes, right away. Excuse me, Sir. The keys to your house! The Circle at Navigli 4, 3rd floor! - Thanks! Thank you. - Bye! Oh, God. - Now you're the mother of us all. Even of me. OK. But with that big beard, it doesn't look it. That's right, a father. A father-child. Who's that? Will you get it? - Yes, take Eleanora. Where is the telephone? - The phone? On the chair. Yes? At my place? Yes, they were there. I'll be right over. 3:40. - 3:40. His presence was brought to the attention of HQ. In the attempt to cover his flight, the brigatista Stefano De Benedetti, fired first with a Kalashnikov-type machine gun. From an initial examination, the serial number doesn't appear because it was filed off. I saw her with my own eyes. I was on the balcony. I heard the shots and saw her jump down. He tried to run away and that's why they fired. She was Swedish, always high. Take care, Mr Disegni. Go get the car. - Yes. Claudia, I must go to the police station. They know I've nothing to do with it. But I'm the owner of the apartment. They found weapons and Red Brigade fliers. Come, Claudia, don't do this. She was afraid to live the growth. She crossed the threshold to escape herself. What are you saying? Don't say anything, OK? These are moments of life too. You must learn to enjoy sorrow. Bye, OK? See you at home. He said it. Why don't you tell the teacher? Enough! I'm sick of this nonsense! Another asshole, the son of assholes, called him a black bastard. It's been years, eh? You should get over it, right? No. "Mama! He called me a black bastard!" Fight back! Do something! Why don't you kick him? Else, you'll always be different! We are all different. It's equality that's racist. Please, don't confuse him, eh? On October 1990, the traditional first Thursday of the month at the Bertelli home, was dedicated to celebrate the final, irrevocable decision of the engineer to retire from all work activity. Now, I'll give my speech. - Don't tire yourself. Please! Please! Some friends said to me, "Franco, it must be a mistake that you're giving up all activity after so many years of work?" You know well that my ambition was always to see the dawn of the 3rd millennium. And for that I still have to wait 10 years. Well then, do you perhaps think that the act of reaching that date isn't an extraordinary work in itself? I'll have to exercise and go swimming everyday or get massages, inhalations, long walks, go get some spa treatments, and some physicals exams, etc. Just imagine! Anyway, I raise my glass… of non-carbonated mineral water, not exactly, and I toast something very precious to me, excuse me, my health. Congratulations! - Extraordinary. Grandpa, congratulations. - Eleonora. Thank you. Thank you. Happy 2000, Dad. Thank you, dear. And many more like this, Grandpa. - Thank you, Alberto. Thank you. The present is the time between the past and the future. But the past is past. It no longer exists. It has past as Epicurus says. And the future doesn't exist because it hasn't happened yet. Between two non-existences there cannot be an existence. They may only appear to be. Therefore, we live in an illusion. He has a certain charm, right? - Yes, he's a character. Thanks. He looks like one of those survivors from India who became vendors of wisdom. Perhaps, but he's handsome. - If you say so. Handsome? One morning, Claudia suddenly had a clear intuition. It was the summer of 1993. Wisdom can't be imitated. Wisdom can't be imitated! What are you saying? Wisdom can't be imitated. Indeed. You must live it. Are you thinking of someone? You. But I don't imitate anyone. Shall we make paradise? Why? Because it doesn't work anymore, can't you see? You never change. You always want the same thing. It's you who doesn't want it. You've changed. Yes. I've grown. Aldam and Eve can even go skipping to the nursing home. This kindergarten isn't fun anymore. Yes, he changed. He changed as men sometimes do. They exchange women. Wow… Yes. She works at the library too. She's 23 years old and much taller than him. Graduated only 8th grade. Then you're hurt? It makes you unhappy. No. I'm only disappointed by its banality. What must I do? Do what you've already decided to do, my daughter. On September 25, 1994, the last meeting was held before the judge. Why do you want a divorce? I want to get married again. And you? To no longer be married. On November 1999, the sect of the "Witnesses of the Last Peace," caused with a package full of GSX, a new, powerful, explosive, the collapse of the Federal Bank of the Po. The Bertelli couple, who were inside for some transactions with bonds and securities, were swept under the rubble and were extracted after 24 hours in a very bad condition, especially the engineer. I did everything I could: I was still in great shape, 140/80 blood pressure, 180 cholesterol… If I really don't make it to 2000, it's only due to a force majeure. It's not fair! But you will make it, Franco. You'll see. You will make it. Don't get yourself down. There are just a few weeks until the year's end. That's exactly what tortures me. Almost having arrived at the goal and not being able to reach it. You'll see, you will reach it. You will. He didn't reach it. Excuse me. It's OK, it's fine. Hello. Hello. What beautiful flowers. Goodbye, Franco. Dear friend. We shall feel the absence of your spirit, always in tune… with the wishes and hopes of the youth of today. My respects, Alda. Don't hesitate to call. Alberto, Eleonora, take care of your grandmother. I must stay to pay and… Bye, Mom. See you at home. Claudia! Pino! Come here. Come here! You see that house at the foot of the trees? I used to live there. And your husband? Ex-husband. I divorced in '94. You were right. Me? - Yes. Don't you remember? You refused to be the best man. Because you had understood it all. I was madly in love with you. I had nothing against him. He was a very good person but… I had a lot to think about in these last years. My father left me more money than I ever would've imagined. Now I'm the one in charge. Will you come with me? Where? I don't know yet but… there must be some place where one can do something. To do something? Do what? To help. Well, with you by my side, maybe together we could… give meaning to our lives. - No, wait, Claudia… Far from hypocrisy, selfishness. We are a drop in this infinite sea… Claudia! - Yes? There is only one truth: That I am a mediocre man. Now I have to tend my own grocery store. And a girlfriend too that… not that it's important but… she's only thing I have. And by going on all these years, she's like a wife. But you said it wasn't important. OK, I understand. Mauritania, January 2001, Franco Bertelli Village SCHOOL The fax arrived! It should work now. The government will give us another 400 hectares. Try the engine. Another 400 hectares? Meanwhile, the only well we have doesn't work. I'm going now to see if I can fix it. You are? I'll go too. Don't you feel hotter than usual? - No. It must just be my impression. To irrigate another 400 hectares, we'll need at least 10 wells. How can we do it? - We'll build them. You must stay cool. I've already called two boys, two graduates in farming from Cosenza. What matters is to teach people the technology. This way they'll be independent, you see? I'm so happy. And you? I'm happy, if you're happy. Oh, God! Calabrone, what's the matter? My God, get up! Get up! Help! He was diagnosed with sun stroke. But instead it was one of the first cases of "picna," the new disease of African origin, which will be recognized only in 2009, when like lightning, it will spread throughout Europe. A week ago, there was another case in Buguni village. It's not that I believe in these things, but they called Ngolo. Another case? And who is this Ngolo? Ngolo is a sorcerer who lives on the mountain. I don't believe in these things but it's better than nothing. Let's call him. He can't be anymore useless than this equipment here. Yes, Ma'am. The first symptoms were partial amnesia and a progressive loss of identity, joined with a resurgence of repressed parts of the unconscious. Who are you? I'm Claudia. And what are you doing here? We went to the well and you passed out. In my town, there are many sick people too. They lack everything, they… they don't even have water. But what are you doing here? The well isn't working and one of must go! You… you are ill. How do you feel now? Is this the first time I've woken up? No. This is the second time. And what do I have? They can't tell. Tell me, how do you feel? Tired. I'd like to close my eyes and wake up in my house. We will return. When everything is finished. When it's all finished, I'll be finished too. What do you mean, Pino? And what would I do without you? You've done without me your whole life. What is it now? You're right. Claudia, there's something I wanted to say to you many times. Do you know what it is? Go fuck yourself. Claudia Bertelli entered on April 10, 2007, the "Community of the Sun," founded by her in Monferrato. May 16, 2008. A few years later, her beautiful daughter Eleonora, married Enrico Bossi, grandson of the federalist who enjoyed a decided popularity in the 1990s. Papa! Excuse me, but you're late. Where's your mother? She's not coming. What? Why did she make us come here? She wanted Eleonora to get married in the temple that grandpa liked. We'll see her later. Listen, Alberto. Do me a favor, tell the pilot to wait for us. Shalimar, this is my daughter Eleonora. Eleonora, this is my wife Shalimar. Do you know my wife Shalimar? I wanted to introduce her to your mother. You can introduce her later when we get there. Let's go. Yes, let's hurry. I want to see mom before dark. And your husband? - Waiting inside the temple, no? Dad, you must press the button to call the priest. No, Dad, the second. There are 3 channels: Buddhists, Christians, Israelis. - Ah, right. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Dearly beloved, you have come together in the Father's house, so that your love receives His seal and consecration. Here we are. We're flying over the abyss. Ask to land. India Charlie 1 to Mike Delta, I ask permission to land. Go away immediately. You cannot land. Tell him we must land! My mother is waiting for us. Claudia Bertelli! Nobody is waiting for anybody. The souls are in communion with the great earth, in contemplation of the Holy Void. Ask him, how long they'll be there. 28 days. The month dedicated to the Holy Void has begun. The souls of the sun cannot speak for 28 days, They are being emptied of all impurities. Their bodies are transforming into an empty shell. Let's go down, I want to talk to my mother! Your mother is with you, she lives with you in a larger family. Go in peace. Be patient, dear. Your mother will come back home. You'll see. She'll come. Don't cry. Yes, but first let's go down, then we'll leave. Claudia Bertelli didn't come back. On the bright and warm day of August 3, 2011, while praying with her brothers to an unknown god, prostrate, arms spread wide, she didn't rise at the tolling of the bell.
