15 JUNE 10°C Within fifty years, I have no doubt there will be settlements on the moon and by the end of the century I truly hope humans will be living on Mars. SOUTH Shit! Is this the fucker who betrayed his best friend? My life, my choice. I'm not betraying anyone. I spoke to the banker. Without you, they're dumping us. You didn't want to come to the States with me. Now it's your problem. Anyway, they're forecasting -12 in the north. You'll either die of the cold or catch some virus here. Your American boss is a clown. Saying he can send people to Mars in 2024, that's taking the piss! Come down to earth! This is where we can get rich! Why are you talking about making money? This is about the future of humanity, you twat! The future, my arse! You'll crash and burn! Yeah, piss off. I'm calling to see how you are. Well, I was thinking of you, and... with this cold and no news I was worried. No, I've found a new job. Yeah, it's good. It's quite hard. A week ago I was the love of your life. I moved to this town for you, after all. No, all I want is to spend time with you. I just want us to do stuff... "What sort of stuff?" I don't know. Just stuff... Hello? WEST That's it, come closer. Lick your fingers. Shove them in deep. Faster. Shit! I can't. Don't worry, it happens. It's this fucking cold! - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. - Don't you want to come here? - That's nice, but I can't. I can lend you some woolly jumpers, if this cold continues. I'll warm you up. I have to go. Another connection. No, wait! This cold isn't only in France. Throughout Europe and the world the icy air is not only paralysing people, but the economy too. As well as industrial incidents caused by frozen pipes and electrical problems, farming and animals have been especially affected. If this cold continues, we'll have to prepare ourselves for severe food shortages. See? Because of all their shit... they'll get their end of the world. You're not saying anything? You're cold, eh? Hungry? So am I. NORTH End of the line, everybody out. Are you punishing us? Showing us what hell is like? I agree with you. All the lights, all the kerosene, all the plastic, all the things to buy, all the desires, all the... all the selfishness. But I... I don't want anything. I help people. All morning I was handing out coffee and bread to the homeless. On my one day off. You must have seen me. No. Sorry about getting snappy, but... I'm cracking up. I know that I shouldn't complain, that you're doing it to teach us the cost, but I'm cracking up. I can't take any more. I'm no longer content with... looking after other people. No one looks after me. I'm not asking for much. Just... just to meet someone. Just... just love. Love doesn't cost you anything. It's not much to ask, just once in a life. Hi, Pandora! Great alias! It's because of hope... Awesome, you're a poet! A believer, mostly... I think we should get together. To warm each other up. Tonight? OK but how will we know each other? I have a grey coat... and I like flowery dresses... Yeah, it's me. You must still be asleep. Be careful when you go outside, the temperature really dropped last night. I got a call to do a report in the sticks, talking to youngsters about... "Is it the end of the world?" They can't help but get all dramatic. Mind you, it is pretty freaky. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Well... you be careful. Love you. Stop here. You said Trocadéro. EAST Hello? Yeah, mate. Yeah, I'm... not far. I'm on my way. Yes, I am, I'm on my way. I set out and... Give me some leeway. Ten grand is hard to find. No, tomorrow's not possible. I'll have it by tomorrow, don't worry. Hello? Shit! Motherfucking bastard dealer! Please! I'm freezing my balls off! Fucker! - Hello. - Hello, Villeneuve? - General Paquin here. - Sir. Don't go to training, come straight to my office. You'll be pleased, you're going somewhere warm. How long will you be? I'm on the road. Ten minutes. We need you in the desert. They attacked the base. Captain Blum took a hit. He'll live but he lost a leg and a piece of skull. He was preparing an operation. You'll be replacing him. It's confidential. We think the enemy had been watching us for a while. That makes the operation even more urgent. You leave tomorrow morning. Come to my office for the briefing. SUMMER FROST Yes, we're coming to the end of the world, but... I think we've deserved it. If it drops to -40, it'll be hard with the chickens and sheep. But technology can... I think we should use technology, but use it wisely, and... If it is the end of the world, it's a shame it has to end like this. Yeah, it'd be cool to go to Mars, I think. It could be cool. Even if it's the end of humanity, it's not the end of the world. There'll always be bacteria, living creatures... I'm destined to stay on earth and die like everyone else. Only the elite will get to leave and try to build a new society, but if it's the same as on earth, why bother? I really think that it's all turning... Can I swear? It's all turning to shit, and we're... we're going to be in big trouble over the coming years. Sam, switch it off. He's dead. Hello? - Did you hear my message? - No time. We haven't stopped. Are you all right? I'm on the road. It's weird. There's no one around. Get home. It's not safe outside in this cold. You know I'm no housewife. And we need money, don't we? Because you love your luxuries. My dream is to live in a cabin. A cabin? Is this a new thing? No. I don't know why you all want to run away. Franck's afraid the cold will stop planes taking off. He's got on an earlier flight. We won't see him before he leaves. Go to see him on Mars. I wish I had a more loving brother. He's like a war machine. No emotions. Let him get on with his life. He's your brother, not your son. You don't regret it? - I feel that maybe we missed out. - What could we offer a kid? A frozen planet? Do you love me? - Why are you asking me that? - I don't know. The cold. Yes, I love you. Why wouldn't I? Do you think we will have snow the day of the weeding In June it's crazy. I'm afraid it brings bad luck. Do you ever doubt about marring me? No. - The cold makes me feel old. - I'm your last chance you know. - There is a sign. - A sign? - No not a "sign", a swan. - I don't understand. He is... I knew someone who called me "the swan" because I loved the Water Lilies. We'd always meet there, looking at the paintings in the museum. You don't care about the Water Lilies any more. But I... can't bring myself not to care. It's Alice. I'm in front of your place. You haven't forgotten it's your birthday? I've got your favourite cake. - Sorry, something came up. - Is it serious? Will you be back soon? I've been waiting fifteen minutes and I'm frozen. No, don't wait, go home. I have things to do. - I could help you. - No, you can't. Sorry. I'll call you later. I'm dead and you're a ghost. Is that right? I'm going to take care of you. For ten years I hoped to bump into you, but I never saw you. And now... - Where are we going? - The hospital. You fainted from the cold. No, I can't, I have a dress to try on. - Calm down. - And I'm working tonight. I can't let you go. We have to run tests. You let me go once before. - Tell him to stop. - Your heart's beating too fast. We have to check. I survived a broken heart, I can manage without you again. Let me go. Sam. Stop, please. Without Vahid why am I here? I can't wait a year to get my papers. I'll keep moving. But I need money. I've nothing left to lose. OK. Where? Get inside, it's freezing. Got a cigarette? Do you smoke? Please. You, the perfect man, reason incarnate? Reason is starting to piss me off. Give me one. Maybe it's the end of the world. The end of the world? No, it'll blow over. - We shouldn't have let her go. - The girl in fur? With her heart, she should have had an ultrasound scan. It's always the same. You can't force them if they don't want. It's their life, not ours. - I think I've messed mine up. - Stop it! - I can't talk, I'm in the middle of... - I want to know if you like the dress. Oh, I didn't get the chance to go because the... of the swan. And now I gotta go to work, but I'll go see the dress tomorrow. You okay? - You seem... - Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, I'll leave you alone. I love you. Me too. Darling, I've been calling your mobile all morning to wish you happy birthday, but you don't answer. They say you can pass out if you're not well wrapped up. So be careful. I know your father's and grandfather's commemoration isn't for a month yet, but they want a big affair, so they want you to write a speech about this vocation passed from father to son. How are things with Alice? I like her, she's really nice. You should propose. You're 45, if you don't marry soon it'll be too late to have children. So, call me back, think about your speech, and above all wrap up warm! It's General Paquin. You're leaving earlier. With the weather as it is, we prefer having some leeway. Your plane takes off at 9:45 a.m. Be ready. Mum. Mum! I know you're there, open the door. Please, Mum! We have to talk. Please, Mum! - Don't shout! - I need 10,000. Or I'll get killed. Help me, I'm your son! Your dad says giving you money only harms you. Come on! This is serious. Please! Just help me out. Look, I found a photo of you and your brother Why don't you go and see him? He'd love that. He's lonely over there. Stop talking to me about him all the time. Think about me, for once! Yeah, it's me. I've got a problem. The guy said he'd have a grey coat. There's a guy here in a grey coat, but he's all... he's hunched up, sitting on the altar. - A homeless guy? - No. Well, I don't think so. He's clean, but weird. He looked right through me. - Did you put your lipstick on? - Yeah, I look like the Joker. And the flowery dress? Did you buy it? Yes, but it's so cold I haven't even undone my coat. Seriously? Go and show him the goods! He has a date with a goddess, not a polar bear. Yeah, but I didn't imagine him like that. Stop imagining him, go and see him. I brought you some flowers. Don't you like flowers anymore? If you think I'm ugly, no problem, but you could at least tell me. We're human beings, after all. - I don't speak French. - Okay, but... You have an appointment with Pandora, no? Pandora? - Is that your name? - Yes, more or less, yes. Great name... I'm sorry because I thought that you were Iron Man. I wish I was. OK I am sorry for intruding. What's going on? Shit! Hello. Shit, there's no one here. No, I'm telling you. Just some tramp who looks like a yeti. - It's horrible, the guy's a monster. - The hunched-up guy? - No, the other one. - Which other one? You've lost me. She said the hotel by the lighthouse. There's no hotel here! I've been riding round like a twat! I asked this old guy, who said it's an autel, a sort of shrine. I didn't fucking realise this bird was into priests! I don't know what to do. No, I'm not too hot on spelling. It's me. The guy hasn't come. So where do I go now? - She's fucked me over! - No guy's ever good enough. I'm here, but this bird isn't! Might as well shoot myself! Call him again. It's so cold here. Remember we may turn into frozen meat. It's the end of the world, go for it! Choose one and take him home! Have you got heating? What a fucking country! Yeah, I'll be in touch. See you. Excuse me, do you have be any aspirin? Aspirin? My head... it's so cold! My head's gonna blow up. You have Aspirin? My little Joseph, what are you doing here? - Come on in, you must be frozen. - Thanks. What are you doing? Put that bag down. I'm hungry. You think you can just help yourself? Put it down. Put it down! Do you have ID? Let me go. No, I'm reporting this. Come with me. Are you alone? - Are you alone? - Yes. Go round. Move it! Go round, move! Do you enjoy this job, being a shit to people? You think I've nothing better to do than fuck about with losers like you? You're a speck of dust to me. I see the bigger picture. I can give you something, in payment. Yeah? Are you a whore? I'd rather go straight to the cops than that. What do you mean, then? What do you mean? Take whichever one you want. I've also got... town scenes... the sea. Do you do people? People are too complicated. I'm not complicated. Do me. And Prince. Who's Prince? He's like my brother. It's aspirin. Thank you. - You're not from here? - No, I'm back here for my job. I live 150 kilometers away. Traveling sales girl? No. More like a guardian angel. And you? What do you do? I don't want to disturb you. Thank you for your hospitality. Maybe you're... maybe you're hungry, it's good to eat when it's so cold. I have lots of things here. Maybe, like, chicken, or soup. - You sure? - Yes. It's very simple for me. - You're sure I don't disturb you? - No, no, yes, I'm sure. I'm sure you don't. It's warm. I've got the heating on full. I've tampered with the meters. Their bills take the piss! I don't like people taking the piss. It's like their debts, same thing. This is Prince. Can you start with him? Two portraits... That'll take a while. We can get to know each other. Make yourself comfortable. Are you hungry? Yeah? Some ravioli? Are you American? I've never been there. I've never went out my district. My dream is to sing in a church one day, like gospel in your country. You love gospel? - You sing? - Yes, a little. Do you have a wife? I don't believe in love. In what do you believe? Nothing. You can't say that. I'm a believer. You can't be as innocent as you seem. I just try to be a good person. I'm sorry, I can't give you back your kindness. It's okay. I won't ask for nothing. The cold is because of them too. Those who decide. Like the virus before. Exactly the same. And who suffers the consequences? People like you and me. They don't give a toss. We're like slaves, paying all the way. You're born, you pay. You live, you pay. You die, you pay. I want to break that chain. Do you want sugar? Sugar? Your head, it's better? Just tired. Maybe I should go. Maybe you can lay down here, for a while. There's a storm outside. I can sing a song to you, if you want. No, thanks. - Just one... - It's getting late. One, one song. O Christ, benignly view This faithful congregation To praise you gathered here Receive their proffered hymns Receive their proffered hymns To your immortal glory And with all of your gifts May they go home fulfilled And with all of your gifts May they go home fulfilled Middle-Eastern? Shit, he's a migrant, watch out! Kick him out, he'll rob you blind. Stop it! You can't suspect everyone of being a migrant. Anyway, I don't care. I'd give him everything but he doesn't want anything. Give him what? You can't be a saint when you're on the pull! That's why it doesn't work. With guys you take, you don't give! What do I do, then? - Go for it, that's all! - I don't know what to do. It doesn't matter. I'll call you, all right? You're a pain! Just do what you have to do. Bye. Shit, where am I? You collapsed in my garden. Drink this, it'll warm you up. What's that? And who are you? You can't stay, I have to get up early tomorrow. Where were you headed? Nowhere. Don't you have family who could come for you? Family? No. My parents would prefer it if I was dead. That was my only chance. Getting buggered for ten grand should be simple enough. - What? - It was worth it. What? I don't understand. I owe people money, right? So I thought of... Louis. He's a mate of my dad's. A poof. He's always come on to me, but nicely. He lives just up the road from you. These are his ex-wife's clothes. Classy, eh? Louis Garnier? The insurance chap? Yeah, that's him. When I looked into his eyes I thought of my dad and... puked over his shoes. Look, I don't have time to talk. Do you have a little bite to eat? I'm really starving. No. What's your problem? What are you? A hunter, is that it? Army. And don't take that tone with me! No, I can't wait two hours! This person needs taking into town. I know it's cold, but you can still drive! - Excuse me. - Yes? I have no money for a taxi. With the cold they're all busy anyway. This thing's funny. This little model. It reminds me a bit of my dad. He's a bit like you, all for defending France. He doesn't like Arabs, Jews, Blacks or Chinese. He's ready to shoot anything that moves, his shotgun under the bed. You old twats got the world in this state. Go on, get out of here! You wouldn't fancy a quick fuck for ten grand? Seriously. - Don't touch me! - No, wait. Ten grand to save a life, that's good, isn't it? Better than shooting some poor twats. I really need it. Let's try it. When he died, they said I should get another. To do my rounds. They didn't understand I couldn't replace Prince. They don't understand feelings. So they fired me. Sons of bitches! Yeah, it's me. You must be at work still. I thought you finished at six. I hope there weren't too many dead bodies. Call me when you get in. - Shall we do it? - Yeah. Ready? Recording. We're all going to fucking die! Let me talk to her! Georgia! Shit, Georgia! - Have you heard from André? - No, why? I'm totally lost here, I can't remember where I left my car. He must be still working. I'm worried. I've left ten messages, he hasn't called. He's not your son, he's your fella. Stop worrying all the time. Shit, Christine's the same, always busting my balls, calling from the States to say she misses me... Why did you get married if you think that? - Because robots aren't up to it yet. - Are you in a bar? No. But I did celebrate selling the house in the south. Why did you sell it? If you come back to France it'll be handy for holidays. Yeah, but I've got no reason to come back to France for a holiday. When you get sick of it here, you can visit me up there. There's no sea on Mars. Yeah, well, we'll make a sea. Hey! Is that cigarette packet yours? Hang on, there's a nutter hassling me. What? You pig! What's the problem? You're paid by us taxpayers to clean the streets. My sister's having a hard time. You pick up your shit, I'll make my phone call. My job isn't to clean up after people who use the town like a rubbish tip. My job is to empty the bins. So take your hand out of your pocket, there's the bin, take your shitty cigarette packet with your shitty fingers... Stop! You know what I'm going to do with my fingers? I'm going to call the town hall about the bitch hassling me. - And you'll be out of a job. - Hassling? Bitch? Throwing your shit everywhere is punishable with a fine. How much to clean up that shit? Do you want a hundred? I don't want your damn money, it's not about money! It's about respect and civic-mindedness. Heard of them? What's your great plan for humanity, picking up other people's shit? "I'll save this fucked-up world by being a street-sweeper!" So don't lecture me, just shut up! Yeah, "shut up"! You think you can just throw money around, you piece of shit? I don't believe it! Not everything can be bought! That's enough... I have to get back. My hotel's miles away. I have to get a taxi. Wait. I'm cold, too cold. Can I come in for five minutes, just to warm up? Are you with someone? Yes. Well, no, but... - Yes or no? - It's too late. Five minutes. Five minutes? Four minutes. Four minutes? Can I take my coat off? Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - What are you doing? - Checking you're all right. For 11 years I was dead to you. Don't pretend you're interested now. You're wrong. For 11 years I thought about you all the time. But I was married. I was married. You understand? I was committed. I was born of a betrayal, I couldn't repeat that. You can't obsess all your life about being abandoned at birth. Maybe your mother saved you, if she didn't feel up to it. Leaving your wife isn't the only betrayal. Thinking of someone else for 11 years is horrible. That's betrayal. When you really love your wife, you don't lay your fingers on another. In another, do you remember? When you really love a man... I stayed in Paris for two years, like a ghost, hoping I'd bump into you in the street. True love drives you mad. You'd give up everything to be with that person. While you lived your little life of married lies, I sang in shitty dives here. I was offered contracts for tours around the world. But I... stayed here. Until the day I realised you'd never come. And I left. Come here. Please. Please. Stop it. You know what? If you really love me, you'll forgive me. Your five minutes are up, now go. I've wasted too much time. Stop it! Stop it. Please. Please. That must be the hospital. Why don't you answer? Because I'm here. For now this is what matters. Call her. No. Tell her about us, be honest with her. - I will, but not now. - When? - Not now. - When? Tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow. Now! We don't know what'll happen with the cold. If it keeps up, we can't lie any more. You don't end 20 years over the phone, even if it's the end of the world. - Call her. - No. Call her. Call her, I need proof. I'm here, that's the proof. I'm here. I'm here. I'm getting married in three weeks. Liar. - I'm getting married in three weeks. - Who to? - Someone. - Who? - Someone who really loves me. - Who? I don't understand. You ask me to leave my wife but you're getting married? We all have something to lose. I was ready to do it for you. Go on, then, call him! - Stop shouting. - What's your problem? - We want to sleep. - It's no time to sleep! I'll call the police! I'm all alone in an industrial zone. Each Man in His Night. That's the title of a book, I don't remember who by. I know you don't like it when I worry, but... tell me everything's fine. Shall I call an ambulance? I have to go. No, not A&E. Can you help me get to the hotel? I'm not your slave! It's late, I'm cold, and I have to finish my bins. Come on, be nice. I'll give you a drink to warm you up. "Be nice"? I'm sick of being nice! Are you nice? You might even be dangerous. No, I'm not dangerous. And with you trimmed out like a stolen car, I can't be very dangerous. But I'd dearly like to offer you a meal. Come on. Is it yes? Because I'm hungry. Hey, it's me. I'm worried. I haven't hear anything from you. I hope you are okay. I need you. I love you. Call me. I don't understand. Where are you? Come in. This is beautiful. Take off your yellow coat, you're not on a street corner. This is impressive. What sort of boss are you? I'm not a boss, I'm an engineer. I make robots. So it'll be machines, not pretty girls like you, picking up litter. - You're putting people out of work. - Great! She's a revolutionary! Help! I'm preparing for the world after, because this one is finished. Well, in this world I've messed everything up, so... Yeah. So if it's to end... I won't be missed. No! No pathos, no melancholy, no whining! Come on, get your clothes off. What's that on your t-shirt? Did you do that? It's Monet. I just stole the t-shirt. It's my favourite painting. It's all blurry. I like it to be realistic, and that isn't. It looks real in person. It's a huge painting. I... saw it in a museum in Paris. When I was little. It changed my life. What was your life? Children's home. You don't have anyone? No family? No friends? I don't believe in friendship. What do you believe in, then? In... what I see. Aren't you worth more? You deserve better. As long as I can paint... that's enough. What good is painting if you have to root through bins for food like a rat? You're like me, alone. No? I can sense it. A new girl! It looks ridiculous on me. What will your wife say about you giving me her present? It's my money. But if you'd rather look like a hi-vis Michelin Man, it's up to you. Otherwise keep the dress. Well! I wouldn't like to be your wife. - Vodka? - I'm not your Barbie doll. You wouldn't be my wife or my doll. The class-struggle thing bores me shitless. - Vodka. - No. I don't need to drink. But you... I don't know what you're trying to forget, but... You like them? Yes. A lot. Keep them. My brother-in-law gave them to me, to remind me of France. But I don't give a toss about the Water Lilies. I couldn't find you. Can you give me just ten euros? Then I'll go. Five? If I had any balls, I'd lie naked in your garden and wait to die. My mum always said: "Be the best and you'll be happy." I really don't think I'm the best... at anything. It's my birthday today. - Are you still hungry? - Yeah. What's this? What we're going to eat in space. Like Thomas Pesquet. You just add water. How did you get this? From my American partners. I have to test it. It looks disgusting. Yeah? - Can you cook? - No, so? Then stop criticising. It's like a Pot Noodle, but a space one. - Is your Mars thing serious? - Yes, my Mars thing is serious. A first manned flight in three years. I'll be in the robotics team. I'm a miniaturisation specialist. Right. My speciality is men. I could come in handy on Mars as a whore. - Whore? - Yeah, whore. - That'd never work. - Why? - You lack... - I lack what? Everything. I'm sick of this too! I'm hungry, and I didn't come here to be insulted. If Mars is full of guys like you, I'd rather freeze to death here! What's the point of making robots? You're the robot, look! The pointless plastic flower... All right! I'm just trying to be nice, helping you to assess your skills, because you must have some. - Yes. - Yes, like everyone. - So, what are your skills? - I don't know. - Not cleaning up shit? - No, not cleaning... No, it's not cleaning up shit. It's... love. - What? - You're a pain with your "love". A pain? You have a wife, don't you? And kids, I bet. - We know what wives and kids are. - What? Madness. They're pointless. You've never been bowled over by someone? Prepared to leave everything for her, follow her anywhere? Let me show you something. You feel the cold? I'm frozen. I don't feel a thing. I don't feel a thing because... I spent my childhood seeing my dad madly in love with my mum, while her mind was on another man. The house ended up like a tomb. My sister ended up being afraid of love, she became fucking sensitive. I learnt to feed myself. I ate my own heart. Because I didn't want to grow up at the mercy of... three stupid emotions, three excitements, three illusions. What you've just said is so sad. On the other hand, I was wrong earlier. As a whore you'd be perfect. Are you a real hero? With medals and all that? No, the real hero was my grandfather, who was at Verdun. The only time I was in the field, I was in a two-man patrol. I was in front. Suddenly a guy with a grenade appeared. I should have fired. Instead... I shit my pants. Literally. You understand? The shame! I was paralysed. Four seconds of shame. The enemy used that time to throw his grenade, and only then did I fire, but four seconds too late. My companion was killed and I was half-deafened. I swapped my trousers for his. Everyone thought he was the coward who shit himself. They gave me a medal. And I got transferred. I specialised in marksmanship. Sniper. I never went back out into the field. I'm a reserve, because of my ears. And now... I'll join the battlefield tomorrow. - Wait. - Scary, isn't it? I could take you out in a second. But I can't. Not anymore. Stop! - Go on! - What are you doing? No! Put it in my hand after. Stop it! Go on! Go on, do it! Go on! Go on, shoot! Shoot! 16th JUNE 5°C Hope is reborn this morning after last night's storm brought a warm wind that has caused a spectacular rise in temperatures, back to normal for the season. Contrary to the disaster forecasts we've been hearing for two weeks, the end of the world won't be just yet. Yes, I know. I didn't see the time. Wait for me, I'm coming. Where do you want to go? If you're after cheap tickets, I can help you. Detroit. America. What's there? I have a cousin there. What else? Is that all? A memory of old cars. Mustangs. You like cars? I thought you were a teacher. I'm a teacher who likes Ford Mustangs. What if it turns bad? You're on your own, I don't know you. "It was but a brief flash, "a meteor... "which manifested itself in the appearance of a woman, "or, rather, an angel. "The brightness around her showed me, "just for an instant, a second, "all the misery of my existence, "but also helped me understand grandeur and beauty. "But that light was soon swallowed up in the abyss of the shadows, "where it must inevitably disappear..." - Hello. - It's me. Is this a good time? Why didn't you call me? I thought you were dead. I am dead. Youcan do faces. It's your face. It's... beautiful. You should take those glasses off. I'll take care of you. It'll be my goal in life. I'll feed you, you'll never be cold again. I... don't need anyone. You're lying. No, wait! What are you scared of? This is what loneliness does to you. Look at me. Everyone's scared of everyone, it's how they control us. Shit! Listen to me! Look how alone we are! The psychologists, the support groups, that's all bullshit! I don't need anyone to tell me how to piss or eat or love! Shit! I just need a friend! Is that too much to ask? Someone who understands me. Is it too much to ask? Someone who won't abandon me. Who'll comfort me. Take care of me. Wait. Wait. I want to be beautiful, but in real life! Painting is death! You were my last chance! You don't give a fuck. You were right, I forgive you... Léo. Hey, it's me, it's me. It's me. Joseph. It's Joseph. Can you hear me? I've come to get you. Are you going to war? No. I'm going to take care of you now, all right? Look, I've got you some... soldiers, look. Two planes. One for you, one for me. Remember? You used to love playing with them. And you loved being nasty to me, remember? I'll get you out of here. I can't, I'm waiting for someone. Who? They promised someone would come, to make my dream come true. What dream? Chef! There! Hey, look. Look. I've got money. Here, look. Take it. I'm waiting for someone. No, take this, we can leave right away. What's wrong? Come with me. Come on. Come with me. Come on! Don't be childish. Police! Don't move or I'll shoot! Turn around. Turn around. Who are you? Where are you from? You betrayed me. You said you didn't want anything. I don't promise anything. You almost killed a guy. What do you know about death? I know the law. I'm coming now. Why didn't you tell me you were a migrant at the beginning? I was afraid. I would have helped you. I can't help a killer. Believers like you... kill people like me in my country. We came through the mountains. A woman walked on a landmine. She blew up in front of my eyes. In front of her son's eyes. I took him with me, we travelled together and then he died of the cold. Just before we arrived. You're wearing his mother's scarf. Death is all around. Why can't I kill a dirty smuggler for the local mafia if I can get a passport and some money in return? Why can't I start a new life? Change of programme. You can go. Are you sure? Positive. You can go. Go away. I'm sorry. Will you marry me? What's going on? You scared me. It's a strange place to meet. Did the cold make you romantic? It's over. I'm leaving. It's funny. When the temperature went back up, I thought... we're saved! It's not the end of the world! But finally... it is. What do you think of the length? I lengthened it. Isn't red a bit too much for a wedding? No, on the contrary. They all want white, but that's not what love is. The waist isn't too tight? No, it's perfect. Maybe black would have been good too? Are you all right? Do you want a glass of water? Vodka? Yeah, a vodka maybe. No, I don't know what happened. What? Where? Sorry! I'll be right back! I want to go in! - Can I come in, please? - No. Just five minutes, to see what's left. - It's an important painting to us! - This is a restricted zone. - You don't understand. - Please leave the area. You don't understand. - I'm no danger, just heartbroken. - It's not possible. It's dangerous. It'll get even worse over the coming weeks. Hello. Yes, it's me. Are you sure it's him? You know, I'll... never paint another portrait. I'm giving up painting. I don't know what to say. He was a good guy. What will you do now? I don't know. I've never understood why he loved the Water Lilies so much. We never agreed about art. Or about music, for that matter. What makes a couple? I don't know. All my life I've been afraid. Afraid for him, afraid he'd leave... afraid of being alone... You see, I haven't realized we shouldn't be afraid. Maybe that's what kills love. Fear. Hello, it's me. Yes, you have to find who painted those paintings. Find out if they're for sale, for how much... And I absolutely have to meet the artist. As soon as possible. Here's what we'll do. Gather everything in your studio, the drawings, the sketches, the notebooks, everything. We'll have an exhibition centred around the portraits of the terrorist and the dog. We'll send out invitations and we'll invite the press. In the meantime you can prepare a speech for the journalists. And in a few weeks your renown will skyrocket. I've stopped painting, I've given it up. You have nothing else, not a single painting? He was right. Painting is death. Young lady, death is you, not painting, if you give it up. Can you spare some change? Hello. I'm hungry. Hello. Excuse me. Hello. I'm hungry. I don't have anything. Okay. Could I... Could I paint your portrait? I can pay you. It's for an exhibition. Do you... want to? - Now! - One... Two, three! Go on. Yes, that's good. Be careful, just keep the yolk. Don't... Careful! That's a disaster, a disaster. Never mind, put the yolk in. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter! Look! No, look, it really doesn't matter. I'll chuck that away, there! We'll start again. No problem. We'll start again... Just a sec. Do it while I'm not here. Can I leave you a minute? Do it while I'm not here, it'll be great. It'll be even better. Could I speak to the romantic girl? Know who this is? Yes, it's the Martian. A bad memory? It depends. Are you still the man without a heart? Well, very odd things have been happening to me, like waves, like... a sea current inside me. That's how you know, isn't it? That you know what? The heart thing. That's how you know. Well, you feel it. It hurts, doesn't it? I don't know. I no longer feel anything. I did as you said. I'm no longer a romantic. Maybe what you're feeling is my heart. Maybe you stole it from me. You can take it to Mars. I'm no longer so sure I'll be going. I have to go. I have a new job, thanks to you. Something useful. Wait, I think I was wrong. What about? Dreams. What dreams? Can I ask you a question? Can you leave your heart with me for a little while? Will you give it back one day? One heart between two should be enough. I don't know. We could try. Yes, we could.
