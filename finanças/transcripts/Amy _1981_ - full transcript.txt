COULD I GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT? >> NO, THANK YOU. >> UH, YOU KNOW WHERE MY OFFICE IS. IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL YOU WANT, YOU JUST GIVE ME A HOLLER. >> THANK YOU. >> YOU'LL HAVE SIX STUDENTS TO START WITH. BELIEVE ME, I REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT YOUR TASK IS GOING TO BE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE PASSIONATELY THAT THE DEAF CAN NEVER BE TAUGHT TO SPEAK. I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOME OPPOSITION TO YOUR WORK. BUT I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO GIVE IT A TRY. WE HAVE 20 BLIND CHILDREN AND 40 DEAF. AND, AS YOU WILL DISCOVER, THEY DON'T MIX. THE LIFE HERE IS HARD, MS. MEDFORD. MOST OF THESE CHILDREN COME FROM POOR MOUNTAIN FOLKS. SOME FROM THE COAL MINING COUNTRY. AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS SCHOOL, SOME OF THEM MIGHT FACE A LIFE SHUT UP IN A DARK ROOM. SO BETWEEN THAT AND HARD, HARD IS BETTER. >> UHH! >> UHH! >> OOF! >> JUST GEORGE? JUST GEORGE? JUST GEORGE, THIS WAY. >> I'M SORRY, I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND SIGN LANGUAGE. >> I WAS EXPLAINING WHO YOU ARE TO, UH, HENRY WATKINS. >> HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT HIS NAME SIGN IS "H" ON THE EYES. >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> WELL, THE "H" STANDS FOR HENRY. OWEN CORNER, WHO TEACHES CARPENTRY, GIVES ALL THE DEAF CHILDREN AND THEIR TEACHERS THEIR NAME SIGNS. FOR EXAMPLE, MINE IS "F," AS IN FERGUSON, ON THE FOREHEAD, BECAUSE, AS SUPERINTENDENT, THAT'S AS HIGH UP AS YOU CAN GO. >> WHY "H" ON THE EYES? >> I-I DON'T KNOW, REALLY. PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY DEAF CHILD THAT PLAYS WITH BLIND CHILDREN, AND DEFENDS THEM, TOO, AS YOU CAN SEE. HE WANTS US TO GO TO OWEN CORNER'S SHOP SO THAT HE CAN GIVE YOU HIS NAME SIGN. OKAY. OWEN, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET AMY MEDFORD, THE NEW SPEECH TEACHER. OWEN SAYS HE'S HAPPY TO MEET YOU. HENRY IS SAYING THAT HE WOULD LIKE OWEN TO GIVE YOU A NEW NAME SIGN. [hammering] HE SAID "A" ON THE LIPS, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE SPEECH TEACHER. HENRY'S SAYING THAT, IF YOU LIKE, HE CAN BE "A" ON THE LIPS FOR YOU. BUT FOR HIM, IT'LL ALWAYS BE "A" PRETTY. >> BLESS, OH FATHER, THIS FOOD FOR OUR USE. AND BLESS US FOR OUR SERVICE IN JESUS CHRIST'S NAME. AMEN. >> AMEN. [indistinct chatter] >> THIS MADE ME HUNGRY. >> APPLES, PLEASE. >> BREAD. >> YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DEAF CHILDREN LONG, AMY? >> FOR A WHILE. >> SURE IS INTERESTING, YOU TEACHING DEAF CHILDREN TO SPEAK. I ALWAYS SORT OF FIGURED THEY COULDN'T. >> WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR TRAINING, AMY? >> IN BOSTON. AT THE HORACE MANN SCHOOL. >> OH...YOU TAUGHT THERE. >> WELL, NOT EXACTLY. I WAS MORE LIKE A-- AN ASSISTANT. THIS IS MY FIRST JOB. >> WELL...YOU CERTAINLY ARE QUALIFIED TO TEACH WHAT EVEN THE EXPERTS SAY IS TOTALLY UNTEACHABLE. >> MALVINA, LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT AN ORALIST. AMY...WE'RE NOT EXPECTING YOU TO WORK ANY MIRACLES. >> OH, NO. OF COURSE NOT. >> MY NAME IS AMY. I AM HERE TO TEACH YOU TO SPEAK. I DON'T UNDERSTAND SIGN LANGUAGE. SO IN THE BEGINNING, MS. DODD WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I SAY. I WANT YOU TO WATCH MY LIPS. I WILL ONLY SPEAK WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME. I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY BY READING MY LIPS. I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO SPEAK, JUST THE WAY I DO. WHEN I SPEAK, YOU CAN FEEL THE VIBRATIONS ON MY CHEEK. YOU CAN FEEL THE VIBRATIONS. FEEL THE VIBRATIONS ON MY CHEEK. YOU CAN FEEL THE-- PLEASE, I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. I'M--PLEASE, NO! PLEASE HELP ME! NO! CAN'T YOU HELP ME, PLEASE! IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO. WHY... [clatter] IT'S ALL RIGHT! I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. >> STOP. STOP, STOP! NOW, SHE WON'T HURT YOU. GO AND SIT DOWN. GO ON, SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. [children playing] >> WHAT DOES MALVINA DODD HAVE AGAINST ME? >> OH... SHE'S NOT A BAD PERSON, REALLY. SHE'S BEEN HERE A LONG TIME, AMY. SHE'S DEVOTED TO THE CHILDREN. WHEN THE DEAF CHILDREN COME HERE, NONE OF THEM KNEW HOW TO SIGN. SHE TAUGHT 'EM. I THINK SHE JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE ANY OF 'EM CAN EVER BE TAUGHT TO SPEAK. >> I'M NOT EVEN SURE I CAN TEACH THEM. >> NOW, DON'T YOU BE DISCOURAGED. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING THESE CHILDREN BRAILLE, AND MOST OF 'EM DIDN'T KNOW A RAISED DOT FROM A WART ON A HOG'S NOSE. [both laugh] AH, THIS HERE IS WESLEY MOODY. HE'S OUR YOUNGEST CHILD HERE AT PARKER'S. >> HELLO, WESLEY. >> MR. MOON SAID ON MY BIRTHDAY WHEN I'M FIVE, MY EYES WILL OPEN, AND I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE AS GOOD AS EVER. >> WELL, YOU AND MR. MOON HUSTLE ON OFF TO CLASS NOW. HURRY IT UP. >> HERE, WESLEY. >> WESLEY BELIEVES THAT ALL CHILDREN ARE BORN WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED. AND PRETTY SOON, THEY OPEN. JUST LIKE BABY ANIMALS. >> BUT EVENTUALLY HE'LL HAVE TO LEARN THE TRUTH. THAT HE'LL ALWAYS BE BLIND. BUT HE BELIEVES IN IT SO HARD. NONE OF US HAVE THE COURAGE TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH. >> WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN IS SHE? >> SHE'S DELICATE, REALLY. SHE OFTEN TOOK TO BED, LIKE MOST WOMEN, I SUSPECT. SHE'S NOT THE SORT THAT WOULD DO THINGS FOR HERSELF. SHE DEPENDED ON ME. >> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A BURDEN. >> NOT AT ALL. >> YOU'VE HAD NO WORD... A LETTER, ANYTHING? >> NOTHING, OTHER THAN THE NOTE I SHOWED YOU. >> WAS SHE HAPPY? >> OF COURSE. I GAVE HER EVERYTHING. >> THIS IS A BOOK. LOOK AT THE BOOK. PLEASE DON'T. IF YOU KEEP SIGNING, THEY'LL NEVER LEARN. I AM HOLDING A BOOK. THIS IS A BOOK. WE READ FROM THIS BOOK. >> ALL RIGHT. NEXT WORD. OPPORTUNITY. DWAYNE. >> O-P-O-R-T-U-N-I-T-Y. >> 'FRAID NOT. WALTER RAY? >> I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD, MS. GIBBS. I THINK I'M SICK. >> DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE NURSE? >> I CAN TAKE HIM, HELEN. YOU KEEP ON WITH YOUR CLASS. >> WAIT, YOU BETTER TAKE JUST GEORGE TOO. THEY NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT EACH OTHER. WESLEY. >> O-P... U-R? [students laughing] >> [groaning] >> WALTER RAY, WHERE DOES IT HURT? >> DOWN HERE. UHH. >> WE BETTER FETCH THE DOCTOR, HAZEL. >> AMY, THERE'S NO DOCTOR HERE. [Walter groaning] >> AMY, WE HAVE NO FUNDS FOR A DOCTOR, EXCEPT IN AN EMERGENCY. WE HAVE NO FUNDS FOR PROPER HEATING AND NO FUNDS FOR REPAIRS. OUR CHAPEL BURNED DOWN. WE HAVE NO MONEY TO BUILD ANOTHER ONE. WE GIVE THE CHILDREN FOOD THAT'S BARELY NUTRITIONAL. NOT HAVING A DOCTOR IS JUST ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS. NOW, IF IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH... [door slams] [sighs] >> MR. PRUETT, WHERE'S THE NEWEST DOCTOR? >> NEAREST DOCTOR? THAT'D BE DOC CORCORAN. OVER TO ELKINS IN RANDOLPH COUNTY. >> MR. PRUETT, WE'VE GOT A VERY SICK CHILD HERE. CAN YOU HELP ME? >> WELL, OF COURSE. >> SO, YOU SEE, PRINCE JOHN HAD NO FRIENDS AT ALL. OLD PEOPLE BOWED TO HIM AND MADE A FUSS OVER HIM. MANY PEOPLE RESPECTED HIM BECAUSE HE WAS SO SMART. [car horn honks] BUT NO ONE REALLY LIKED HIM. >> [drunken singing] ♪ YO, HO, HO, YOU AND ME ♪ ♪ LITTLE BROWN JUG, HOW I LOVE THEE ♪ OHH. ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DRIVE THAT THING, HUH? >> WELL, IF I CAN'T, I'M IN BIG TROUBLE. 'CAUSE I'M TOO DRUNK TO WALK HOME. [laughing] ♪ LITTLE BROWN JUG, HOW I LOVE THEE ♪ >> WELL... THE ROYAL WIZARD CAST A SPELL ON THE PRINCE THAT TOOK AWAY THE SIGHT FROM ONE EYE. HE HAD TO WEAR AN EYE PATCH, WHICH HE COULD ONLY TAKE OFF AFTER HE LEARNED TO CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AND PERFORM GOOD DEEDS. >> OH. >> OF COURSE, IT WASN'T EASY FOR PRINCE JOHN. HE WASN'T USED TO BEING NICE. BUT AFTER A WHILE, HE STARTED TO CHANGE. LIKE BEING POLITE TO HIS PARENTS. PICKING UP HIS CLOTHES. PRETTY SOON, HE STARTED DOING NICE THINGS FOR OTHERS. AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE BEGAN TO BE KNOWN AS A GOOD DEED DOER. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? >> WHAT? >> ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE KINGDOM WERE SO HAPPY ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING, THEY ALL DECIDED TO WEAR EYE PATCHES UNTIL EACH ONE OF THEM PERFORMED A GOOD DEED. >> BUT... OF ALL THE PEOPLE WEARING AN EYE PATCH ON HIS EYE, THERE WAS ONE WHO WORE AN EYE PATCH ON HIS MOUTH, WHICH IS WHERE IT DESERVES TO BE, I CAN TELL YOU. AND WHO WAS HE? [Irish accent] WHY, HE WAS NONE OTHER THAN ME HIGHLY-ESTEEMED, BUT RATHER TALKATIVE, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER SEAN SHAMUS CORCORAN. AND I, I AM NONE OTHER THAN EQUALLY TALKATIVE BUT FAR MORE HANDSOME, CHARMIN', AND INTELLIGENT BENJAMIN JAMES CORCORAN, M.D. [chuckles] >> YOU ARE THE DOCTOR? >> [speaking normally] AT YOUR SERVICE. WELL... [sniffs] NOW, WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT A SICK BOY, HUH? WHAT'S YOUR NAME, LAD? >> WALTER RAY. >> WALTER RAY, HUH? WELL, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN TROUBLING YOU SO MUCH. >> I THINK YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOME COFFEE. >> [chuckling] [slurring] MAY I SUGGEST, DEAR LADY, THAT YOU LEAVE THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, AT WHICH I AM QUITE COMPETENT, UP TO ME, AND GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, WHATEVER THAT MAY BE. >> I'D LIKE TO STAY, IF YOU DON'T MIND. >> WELL, I DO MIND. ALL RIGHT. >> THANK YOU. [children laughing] >> [groans] GREEN APPLES. >> I BEG YOUR PARDON. IT SEEMS A LITTLE BLIND FRIEND AND GOT HIMSELF INTO A BARREL OF GREEN APPLES. HE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE, FOR FEAR OF BEING PUNISHED. >> ARE YOU SURE? >> [chuckles] A STOMACH FULL OF GREEN APPLES CAN MAKE YOU FEEL SO BAD, YOU THINK YOUR APPENDIX IS GOING TO BURST. NO, HE'LL BE FIND BY TONIGHT. >> I SEE. >> OKAY, EVERYBODY IN. LET'S GO, COME ON. >> I'M SORRY TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU. I'LL PAY YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE. >> I'LL SEND YOU A BILL. OKAY, HERE WE GO. EVERYBODY UP. OKAY, COME ON. COME ON, DARLIN'. HERE WE GO, SWEETHEART. THIS IS FOR YOU. NOW WEAR IT. AHEM. >> OH! DR. CORCORAN. DR. CORCORAN. [car engine starts] [motor puttering] >> OH, MY DEAR MISS DODD. HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE DAY? >> UH, VERY WELL, THANK YOU. AND YOU? >> OH, ALL THE BETTER FOR YOUR ASKIN', DEAR LADY. >> OH. DOCTOR, THE CHILDREN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE PREMISES WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION. >> BUT A LITTLE RIDE-- >> UH, WELL, IF WE START CHANGING THE RULES FOR ONE-- >> YOU ARE RIGHT, AS ALWAYS, MISS DODD. YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. NOW, AMY, YOU MUST ALWAYS LISTEN TO MISS DODD SO YOU CAN LEARN THE RULES, HMM? AS FOR ME, UH, SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE AROUND HERE, I REALLY CAN'T BREAK THEM NOW, CAN I, HMM? WELL, OKAY. GOOD DAY, LADIES. HERE WE GO. >> NO, UH-- JUST A MINUTE, MISS MEDFORD. I, UH... I THINK WE'D BETTER GET A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT. YOU ARE AN OUTSIDER. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW OUR PEOPLE ARE. AND THESE CHILDREN DON'T NEED YOUR EXPERIMENTS. THEY DON'T...NEED YOUR WORDS. THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO COPE AND THEY NEED SIMPLE SKILLS. >> BUT LEARNING TO SPEAK CAN ONLY BENEFIT THEM. >> YOU KNOW THEY WILL NEVER BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY. THEY NEED TO STAY WITH THEIR OWN KIND. NOW, THAT IS THEIR REALITY. WORDS WILL GIVE THEM NOTHING BUT... FRUSTRATION AND HEARTACHE. IT WILL GIVE THEM FALSE HOPES. AND I DON'T WANT MY BABIES TO LEAVE HERE WITH HOPES THAT CAN NEVER BE REALIZED. WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY? OR ARE YOU AS MUTE AS YOUR STUDENTS? >> AMY...DO YOU EVER GET LONELY HERE? I MEAN, HEH, WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO HERE ONCE CLASSES ARE OVER. >> I MADE UP MY MIND WHEN I CAME HERE THAT... LONELINESS WAS SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE TO FACE. >> I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE WANTING TO LEAVE BOSTON. WHY, YOU COULD HAVE MARRIED ANY MAN YOU SET YOUR MIND TO. IF I HAD YOUR LOOKS, I'D HAVE MARRIED THE FIRST RICH MAN WHO ASKED ME. >> I DID. MARRIAGE DOESN'T...TAKE AWAY FROM LONELINESS. I WAS LONELIER THERE THAN HERE. >> YOU WEREN'T HAPPY? >> DO YOU KNOW, FOR ALL THE YEARS WE WERE MARRIED, MY HUSBAND COMPLAINED BECAUSE I LEFT THE-- THE CAP OFF THE TOOTH POWDER. >> [giggles] >> HE MUST HAVE YELLED AT ME EVERY DAY FOR TEN YEARS. AND I KEPT APOLOGIZING AND FORGETTING. DO YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY OCCURRED TO ME SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE THAT I COULD HAVE HAD MY VERY OWN TOOTH POWDER. >> WHY'D YOU MARRY HIM? >> I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. A KIND OF BRILLIANCE, I THINK. HE ALWAYS DID WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO. HE COULD ALWAYS MAKE ME DO WHATEVER HE WANTED. I COULD NEVER SAY NO TO HIM. >> WHAT HAPPENED? >> I REALIZED THAT I WAS ALWAYS APOLOGIZING FOR THINGS THAT I WANTED. I JUST COULDN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. SO I LEFT. >> WEREN'T YOU SCARED? >> I WAS TERRIFIED. >> DIDN'T HE TRY TO STOP YOU? >> HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE I AM. >> OH, LORDY. DOES MR. FERGUSON KNOW? >> NOBODY KNOWS. >> KITE. THIS IS A KITE. WE ARE GOING TO FLY THE KITE. WE ARE GOING TO FLY THE KITE HIGH IN THE AIR! >> WELL, IF DETERMINATION CAN MAKE A KITE FLY, YOURS WOULD BE SOARING BY NOW. OH, NO, YOU SEE, THE TROUBLE IS YOU ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. MAY I? THANK YOU. HMM. SEE? SIMPLE PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICS. HUH? GOT IT. HERE WE GO. HUH, HUH? UH-HUH. WE'VE GOT IT. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? >> WELL, WHAT KIND OF A QUESTION IS THAT? I CAME BY HERE TO SEE MY PATIENT. >> YOUR PATIENT IS DOING FINE. >> WELL, THEN, MAYBE I CAME BACK TO SEE YOU. >> YOU COULD HAVE SAVED YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. >> [chuckling] NO, NO TROUBLE AT ALL. ANY IRISHMAN WORTH HIS SALT WILL DRIVE 100 MILES TO SEE A BEAUTIFUL LADY. IN YOUR CASE, I'LL MAKE THAT 200. >> I'M TRYING TO TEACH A CLASS. >> OH, WELL, UH...HERE. G-GO RIGHT AHEAD. >> PLEASE GO AWAY. >> WHAT WAS THEIR RELATIONSHIP LIKE? >> MR. MEDFORD PAYS ME TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE, NOT TO DISCUSS THE FAMILY. >> I'M TRYING TO FIND MRS. MEDFORD. ANYTHING YOU TELL ME MIGHT HELP BRING HER BACK. NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY SHE MIGHT HAVE WANTED TO LEAVE? ISN'T MR. MEDFORD A LOVING HUSBAND? >> MR. MEDFORD'S A GOOD PROVIDER. HE'S WHAT I WOULD CALL A PERFECTIONIST, BOTH IN HIS WORK AND AT HOME. HE'S VERY CRITICAL IF THINGS AREN'T JUST THE WAY HE WANTS THEM. >> AND MRS. MEDFORD? >> MRS. MEDFORD IS A WARM, KIND PERSON. SHE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CHILD. TOOK HIM EVERY DAY TO THAT SPECIAL SCHOOL. AFTER HE DIED, SHE WAS NEVER THE SAME. >> HE NEVER TOLD ME THERE WAS A CHILD. >> [chuckles ruefully] I'M NOT SURPRISED. BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I THINK HE WAS ASHAMED. >> WHY? >> WELL, THE BOY WAS DEAF. >> KITE. >> [hoarsely] KI. KITE. >> KI. >> KUH! KUH! >> KI. >> KITE. >> YES. YES! YES, KITE. SAY IT AGAIN. AGAIN. >> KITE. >> YES. >> KITE, KITE. >> [laughs] >> AMY, I THINK YOU NEED TO LEARN TO KNOCK. >> KITE. >> HE CAN SPEAK. HE CAN SAY A WORD. >> KITE. KITE. >> ONE WORD. DO YOU REALLY THINK ONE WORD IS GOING TO DO HIM ANY GOOD? >> ONE WORD WILL LEAD TO MORE. DON'T YOU SEE? >> [chuckling] >> WALTER RAY, JUST GEORGE... >> YES, MA'AM? >> WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS ON YOUR EARS? >> IT'S AN EYE PATCH. >> EYE PATCH. >> BUT DON'T PEOPLE USUALLY WEAR EYE PATCHES ON THEIR EYES? >> YEAH. >> YEAH, THEIR EYES. >> ONLY WE CAN'T SEE, SO WE WEAR THEM ON OUR EARS. LIKE PRINCE JOHN IN THE STORY YOU TOLD US. AND WHEN WE DO A GOOD DEED, WE GET TO TAKE OURS OFF TOO. >> [chuckles] "AND GRANDMA AND GRANDPA SEND THEIR LOVE TOO. "WHEN WE CAN, WE'LL TAKE THE TRAIN TO VISIT YOU "SOME WEEKEND. "I'M SENDING YOU 50 CENTS FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY. LOVE, AUNT ULLA." THAT'S ALL, WESLEY. HERE'S YOUR LETTER AND YOUR 50 CENTS. I'LL PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET. >> WHAT'S A WEEKEND? >> IT'S WHEN WE HAVE FRIED CHICKEN. >> OH. [children laughing] >> AND THE ARTICULATION PROGRAM--HOW'S THAT COMING? >> FINE. OF COURSE, IT IS A VERY SLOW PROCESS. >> HOW MUCH CAN THE CHILDREN SPEAK? >> WELL, IT'S TOO SOON FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY SPEAK. THOUGH THERE IS A BOY WHO HAS ONE WORD. >> ONE WORD? THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO MONTHS, AND YOU TELL ME ONE CHILD HAS LEARNED ONLY ONE WORD? >> WELL, IN MY OPINION, MR. CARUTHERS, WHETHER IT'S 1 WORD OR 20, IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. >> MALVINA, PLEASE. >> I FEEL OBLIGATED TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST. >> GO ON. I FEEL SUBSIDIZING AN ARTICULATION PROGRAM IS LIKE THROWING MONEY AWAY. LEARNING TO SPEAK, WHETHER A LITTLE OR A LOT, WILL NOT CHANGE A DEAF CHILD'S WORLD. >> MR. CARUTHERS, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT, FOR A LONG TIME, UM, A FURIOUS BATTLE HAS RAGED BETWEEN THE MANUALISTS AND THE ORALISTS. >> THE STATE BOARD IS NOT INTERESTED IN THEORIES, NOR IN DISPUTES-- ONLY EVIDENCE. MR. FERGUSON, I WANT A FULL REPORT ON PRECISELY HOW THE PROGRAM IS DOING. AND I WANT MISS DODD'S COMMENTS, UNCENSORED. >> all: AMEN. >> OH, THANK YOU. >> WHERE'S HELEN? >> ONE OF HELEN'S CHILDREN TOOK SICK. HE CAME DOWN TODAY, ALL-OF-A-SUDDEN LIKE. >> WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE CHILD? >> I DON'T KNOW, BUT... HELEN SAID HE'S BURNING UP WITH FEVER. >> [sighs] JOINTS ARE SWOLLEN. >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> RHEUMATIC FEVER. >> HOW BAD IS IT? >> IT'S BAD. >> HELLO, WESLEY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >> ON TUESDAY, I'M GOING TO BE FIVE. >> THAT'S A WONDERFUL AGE TO BE. >> YOU KNOW WHAT MR. MOON SAID. >> NO. WHAT? >> HE SAID ON MY BIRTHDAY, WHEN I'M FIVE, MY EYES WILL OPEN. >> WELL, THAT'S REAL FINE, WESLEY. >> AT HOME, WE HAD A DOG NAMED RUSTY. AND SHE HAD BABIES ONCE. AND THEIR EYES WERE CLOSED, JUST LIKE MINE. BUT AFTER A WHILE, THEIR EYES OPENED... AND THEY COULD SEE. SO MR. MOON SAID... WHEN MY EYES OPEN ON MY BIRTHDAY... I'LL SEE EVERYTHING. THEN I'LL GET TO GO BACK HOME. >> SHE BROUGHT HIM HERE EVERY DAY FOR, OH, I'D SAY TWO YEARS. AND THEN HE STARTED GETTING THESE EPISODES. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN "EPISODES"? WAS HE AN EPILEPTIC? >> HE'D GET FAINT. HIS LIPS WOULD TURN ALMOST BLUE. I FELT THE CHILD NEEDED MEDICAL CARE OF SOME KIND. SHE MEANT WELL, BUT SHE WASN'T VERY REALISTIC ABOUT IT. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE SHE MIGHT BE NOW? >> NO. I WISH I DID. >> [groaning] NO, NO. OH! IT CAN'T! NO! IT CAN'T BE TRUE. OH...PLEASE. [grunts] PLEASE! NO. OH! [panting] >> AMY. >> [groaning] >> AMY...AMY! >> WHAT IS IT? >> 105. >> DEAR GOD. >> [groaning] MR. MOON. >> IN ONE MINUTE, THEN OUT. WE'LL WAIT THREE, THEN WE'LL REPEAT, HMM? >> OKAY. >> I'LL BOIL THESE LINENS. >> BURN THEM. >> LAST YEAR, WE...HAD AN EPIDEMIC OF INFLUENZA. THERE WASN'T A FAMILY IN THESE MOUNTAINS THAT DIDN'T LOSE SOMEONE. CHILDREN NOT YET WALKING. OLD FOLKS. PEOPLE IN THEIR PRIME. AND IF IT'S NOT INFLUENZA, THEN IT'S... IT'S SMALLPOX OR SCARLET FEVER. OR SOMETHING WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT MEDICINES. WE'RE FIGHTING DRAGONS WE CAN'T EVEN SEE. I-I NEED SOME MORE SHEETS. SOME MORE TOWELS, ANOTHER BLANKET. AND SOME RUBBING ALCOHOL. YOU GET YOURSELF SOMETHING TO EAT, ALL RIGHT? >> HAZEL? >> NO! NO. >> AMY, HE'S DEAD. >> NO! DON'T SAY THAT! >> IT'S OVER, AMY. HE'S GONE. >> LET ME GO! NO. NO! NO! NO! NO! [sobbing] >> SHH. SHH. DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT? IT'S ALL RIGHT, AMY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. >> I HAD A CHILD. OH, BEN... HE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. SO SWEET. >> BUT WHAT HAPPENED? >> HE WAS NEARLY TWO WHEN THEY FOUND OUT HE WAS DEAF. I THINK I LOVED HIM EVEN MORE. I WORKED WITH HIM. I TAUGHT HIM. THEN THEY SAID HE HAD A HEART DEFECT. THAT HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH IT. THEY TOOK HIM AWAY FROM ME. SENT HIM TO AN INST-- INSTITUTION. >> WHO DID? >> MY HUSBAND AND THE DOCTOR. >> DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER CHILDREN? >> MY HUSBAND... SAID I WASN'T CAPABLE OF HAVING NORMAL CHILDREN. >> OH, DEAR JESUS. >> [sobbing] >> I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL, MR. GRIMES. IT'S A PITY YOUR SON NEVER HAD ANY SCHOOLING. IT'S JUST THAT, UH, WE NEVER TAKE ANYONE OVER 16. >> BUT I HEAR TELL IT YOU WAS ABLE TO HELP HIM, TO TEACH HIM. >> WELL, WE CAN TEACH DEAF CHILDREN, WHEN WE GET 'EM YOUNG. IT'S JUST THAT 19 IS... WELL, IT'S--IT'S JUST-- WE CAN'T TAKE ANYONE THAT OLD. >> WELL, MERVIN HERE AIN'T MUCH MORE THAN A BABY. HIS MAMA NEVER DID LET HIM GO NOWHERES. THIS HERE IS THE FIRST TIME HE WAS EVER OUT OF THE HILLS. BUT YOU SEE, WHEN HIS MAMA TOOK SICK, LIKE TO DIED, I KNOW'D ONE DAY SHE WOULD, AND SO WOULD I. WELL, NOW, HOW IS HE EVER GONNA TAKE CARE OF HIS SELF WITH HIS MOM AND ME BOTH GONE? >> I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU. BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE SO MUCH YOUNGER. I'M NOT EVEN SURE HE COULD MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. >> I KNOW HE'S BIG. BUT HE NEVER WOULD HURT ONE OF THEM YOUNG 'UNS. NO SIR. THAT'S ONE THING MERVIN KNOWED. HE AIN'T NEVER TO TOUCH NO CHILD YOUNGER THAN HIM. [sawing] >> YOU SURE WE CAN HANDLE A BOY LIKE THAT? [hammering] >> NO, I'M NOT SURE AT ALL. I JUST DON'T HAVE THE HEART TO TURN HIM AWAY. THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE FOR HIM TO GO. MR. GRIMES, MR. PRUETT WILL SHOW MERVIN TO HIS ROOM. SO I THINK THIS WOULD BE THE BEST TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE. >> I, UH...RECKON IT'D BE BEST IF I JUST GO. >> YEAH. >> WELL... GOOD-BYE, SONNY. >> PLAY. PLAY. PUH. PUH. >> I HAVE A NEW CHALLENGE FOR YOU, AMY. [children giggling] >> DO YOU KNOW YOUR WIFE SPENT TIME AT THE HORACE MANN SCHOOL? >> SHE TOOK OUR SON THERE FOR A SHORT TIME, WHEN HE WAS SIX. THEN I SENT HIM AWAY TO SCHOOL. HE DIED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. >> WHEN WAS THIS? >> ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. >> WERE YOU AWARE THAT YOUR WIFE WORKED AT THE SCHOOL AS A VOLUNTEER DURING THE LATER YEAR? >> NO, I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT. >> IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT MRS. MEDFORD WOULD WANT TO CONTINUE THE SAME KIND OF WORK ELSEWHERE, AT ANOTHER SCHOOL? >> [playing harmonica] >> YOUR MOTHER'S COMING TO VISIT. MOTHER. ROSE... HASN'T HIS MOTHER EVER COME HERE BEFORE? >> THEY NEVER HAD THE MONEY. >> YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO SAY "MOTHER." >> MMM-MUH. MMUH. NOW YOU TRY IT. >> PUH. >> LET'S TRY THIS NOW. WATCH MY MOUTH. MY TONGUE IS IN BETWEEN MY TEETH. THHH. >> HMM. >> NO, THE VIBRATIONS... THHH. >> THHH. >> GOOD. AGAIN. MUH. >> MUH. >> NOW PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. MOTHER. >> MUH... THER. >> THAT'S WONDERFUL! OH! UGH! [laughing] >> THANKS TO THEE, LORD, FOR ALL THOU HAST GIVEN US. MORE PARTICULARLY, FOR THY LOVE, WHICH MAKES US TO FEAR NOTHING AND WHICH MAKES US WHO RETURN THY LOVE TRULY WHOLE. WE THANK THEE FOR ALL THIS AND FOR SO MUCH MORE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, AMEN. THE CHURCH SERVICES ARE ENDED. [children chattering] >> ALL THE BEST TO YOU, AMY MEDFORD. WELL, YOU LOOK QUITE FINE TODAY, IN SPITE OF LYLE FERGUSON'S PEDANTIC PREACHING. >> I NOTICED YOU WEREN'T IN ATTENDANCE. >> AW, NOW DON'T SCOLD ME ON A SUCH A GRAND DAY. I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FOR A DRIVE AND A PICNIC LUNCH. >> I'M WITH THE CHILDREN. >> WELL, I KNEW YOU WOULD BE. IN. I'VE BROUGHT ENOUGH FOOD FOR AN ARMY. [engine starts] >> IT'S GETTING LATE. WE MUST GO BACK. I'LL GATHER UP THE CHILDREN. >> ALL RIGHT. >> HENRY. WHERE'S HENRY? >> HUT, HUT! >> UNH! >> UHH! [chattering] >> HUT, HUT! [boys shouting] >> OHH! >> STAY ON YOUR FEET. >> HEY, GIVE ME THE BALL, KID. HEY, DO YOU WANNA PLAY WITH US? I SAID, DO YOU WANNA PLAY WITH US? HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? IS HE CRAZY OR SOMETHING? >> HE CAN'T HEAR YOU. THANK YOU. >> WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? >> BOY, WHAT A DUMMY. >> YEAH. >> DEAF AND DUMB. [boy laughing] >> WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S SAYING? >> RIGHT, 41. >> 41. >> SET...HUT! HUT! >> I THINK HE WANTS TO LEARN TO PLAY FOOTBALL. HUH? >> OHH! UHH! UNDERSTAND? GOOD. HOW DO YOU FEEL? >> OHH. >> MACKLER, I WANT YOU TO CONTACT THE SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, BOTH STATE AND PRIVATE. ORPHANAGES, SCHOOLS FOR THE HANDICAPPED. EVEN THE ASYLUMS. MRS. PRAY, I WANT YOU TO CHECK OUT NEWSPAPERS FROM ALL THE SURROUNDING STATES, ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH DEAF CHILDREN. AND CHECK THE OBITUARIES. >> HENRY--HENRY, YOU'LL BE THE QUARTERBACK, HUH? CHESTER, YOU'RE GONNA BE THE LEFT HALFBACK. AND, JENS, YOU WILL BE RIGHT HALFBACK. >> [laughing] ARE YOU SURE THIS IS HOW IT'S MEANT TO BE DONE? >> [laughing] >> ALL RIGHT, GANG! >> THEY'RE DOING BETTER. >> GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST. WHAT ARE YOU ALL UP TO NOW? >> FOOTBALL. BEN LEARNED TO PLAY IN COLLEGE. >> LORD HELP US. >> I THINK HE HAS. [laughing] >> COME ON. >> ISN'T IT A BIT UNORTHODOX? >> COMPLETELY. >> NOW, I JUST DON'T KNOW. >> LOOK, VIRGIL, OUR KIDS ARE KEPT APART. EVERYONE TREATS THEM IN A SPECIAL WAY. YET, EXCEPT FOR THEIR HEARING, THEY'RE JUST AS NORMAL AS YOUR BOYS. THE VILLAGE CHILDREN HAVE NEVER MIXED WITH YOUR CHILDREN. I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD WORK. >> IT'S JUST A FOOTBALL GAME, MR. GOODLOW. >> HENDRICK'S BOYS AGAINST PARKER'S. >> OH, YOUR BOYS CAN'T COMPETE WITH MINE. THEY'RE GOOD. THEY PRACTICE EVERY DAY. THEY'D BEAT THE PANTS OFF YOUR BOYS. >> THEN YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. >> LYLE, THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE A FIT. YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE AROUND HERE FEEL ABOUT THE DEAF. YOU CAN'T MIX 'EM. PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT. >> VIRGIL, IT'S OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE TAKING THE RISK, >> YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A BAD SPOT, LYLE. >> PLEASE, MR. GOODLOW. TAKE A CHANCE. [boys chattering] >> WHAT IN THE WORLD WILL I TELL THE PARENTS? >> HUT! HUT! >> GO! >> ALL RIGHT, WE GOT 'EM, GUYS, WE GOT 'EM. YEAH, YEAH!

I COULDN'T BEAR THAT. >> PERHAPS IF YOU WROTE TO HIM, EXPLAINED HOW YOU FEEL. I NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL HIM HOW I FEEL. HE NEVER LISTENED TO ME. >> BUT SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY, PERHAPS HE'D...REALIZE. >> I WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT HE OWNED, LIKE A--A PAINTING OR A STAMP COLLECTION. A USELESS ORNAMENT.
