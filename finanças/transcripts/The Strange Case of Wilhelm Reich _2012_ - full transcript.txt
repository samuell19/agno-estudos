♪♪♪ German ♪♪♪ 30 years after the Arizona Desert. Very well. Plan. Do not touch the pipes. - Raise your head. - I forgot that. How long is it before you go in this direction? It does not turn on. Ready? We can start. We need to turn North... Northwest. So we stimulate the atmosphere with the waves that are emitted from here. So that we can... regenerate. I see. And finally the flowers can grow. Cheers, dad. I'm afraid of the dark. There is no need to be afraid. Did you take a look outside? Wow, quantum place. A shooting star, I saw a shooting star. Now you can make a wish. Sleep well. Lo strano caso di Wilhelm Reich. Daddy why didn't you tell me about the agents, this time you pissed them off. Thing? They reported you, we need a lawyer. He will defend me alone! You have to accept help. I know what is right for me. Hardheaded... I have to finish this. we have proven that these boxes have no medical effect and cannot heal in any way. Dr Reich continued to distribute these crates despite the Judge's order who has expressly forbidden it. Completely violating the law. And by doing so, violating the law, he shows that he has no respect for our country and the same happened in Europe, where he was a sex guru, a Dr who announced he could work miracles a man who has written books on the function of orgasm, and on sexual freedom. This is a man who must be considered a threat to our society. And his discovery of this orgon energy... it's just nonsense. Its existence cannot be proven, it is the fantasy of a charlatan. I am not a law expert, but I know you shouldn't drive on the wrong side of the road and I believe that in my case, the judgment itself escapes the truth. It is impossible for everyone present, including politically motivated ones, to discern which conclusions are drawn from genuine scientific research and which are not. And if we continue like this, any future search for truth will be thrown to the winds. If I'm allowed to say so. Your Honor, if the accused wishes to give a speech he should have rented the people's hall, if you have something to say to the court, I suggest you go directly to the court... I think it was an involuntary momentum. Thank you. I'd like to call the prosecution, Sr. Hills, to testify. Objection, your honor, he needs a signed clearance for this. That just Sr Reich brought, as requested. He can come to testify. Do you swear before God to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Yes, I swear. - You can ask your witness Sr. Reich the questions. - Thank you. Sr. Hills, how long have we known each other? - "You weren't always a court official, were you?" - Objection: It is not a relevant question. Your Honor, the only problem here is the violation of a court order... Sr. Hills, as witness is obliged to answer. Can you be more specific with your question? Thank you Your Honor, isn't it true that 10 years ago you worked not against me, but even for me? Sr. Hills, remember when we founded the institute together? Thank you. Very well, I will not allow anyone to be persecuted in my court. And I don't care what governmental authorities are behind it all. This is a North American court. And here everyone is treated equally. If I find that there is something strange on his part, it will start the judgment from scratch. This is all ridiculous, it happened ten years ago. Sr Kline, why did the FDA choose Sr Hills to pursue this case? The FDA has its reasons and the facts speak for themselves. We need to close this case as soon as possible. You have made progress with my work. But your work has been declared worthless. You need a lawyer. My old lawyer from before is the one accusing me now. The juror responds in an alienated way because his arguments they are too spontaneous and emotional which makes them seem suspicious. Do you want to find out when someone lies? Observe the changes in his voice and breathing. Now, can I ask you to leave me alone with my daughter? You want it to be, but I can't see you destroy everything around you for your stubbornness. - I made them strong. - Yes, you did. Please sit down Dr Hamilton. I'd like you to give Dr. Reich a psychiatric exam. Other, Your Honor? I would like to be able to determine if he was in complete possession of his mental faculties to determine the extent of his offense. Which means that if it was n't, it couldn't be responsible for its actions. Of course. I guess he realized he doesn't have a lawyer. He's digging his own grave. Kings and nobles are on the stage, all men and women are mere actors. But outside there is the prairie, the paradise of naturalness and the bright stars. With its tall, gently moving grass, the prairie knows the fears of man and we have turned our backs on him. Sr Reich, pu venire con me. One moment. I finish writing this thing. Good morning Dr Reich, my name is Dr Hamilton. Good morning. What can I do for you? The judge ordered a psychiatric examination. Have you done this before? Examine a colleague? I guess it's not easy. Would you like something to drink? Do they treat you well? I need something? We can start with the exam. Do you think you know why he's here? I don't believe it, I know. And I also know why she is here. Ah s? - Can you enlighten me? - I hope I can. Ok, let's start over. She was aware of providing these crates was he violating the judge's order against her? They are not crates. They are orgon accumulators. This orgon, what exactly is it? I read in the archives that Einstein met a few years ago, what was his vision? Who cares about Einstein's opinion. Your opinion is important in my case. - My opinion is not important. - Yes I know. All his fears, desires, desires, act on it. And obviously also on this investigation. Do you think you are freeing yourself? Dr Reich, I'm interested in your point of view, not mine yes I know what others think. If you don't give me a chance yourself... I am willing to try. What other option do I have. What right do they have to deprive me of my job? Can you bring us an ashtray? The orgon treatment loads the mouse's red blood cells making them more resistant against destruction. Let's talk about the phenomenon of temperature increase, where else can we see this phenomenon? - In sunburn? - Funny. - Temperature? - Yes, very good. A well known phenomenon, but not yet explained. Thanks to your analysis on blood-filled exhibitions we have the opportunity to establish the presence of cancer cells before any other method of examination. Forgive me, but as a doctor I don't understand much about these physical processes. What exactly is the effect of the battery? Its basic function is to revitalize the natural position. Physics, chemistry, medicine cannot exist separately. They all depend on the others. I believe this may be the problem, as far as I know, from Descartes onwards we have always investigated matter and spirit separately. For the French Revolution it was certainly a triumph to separate the Church from science, but for the investigation of life it is a disastrous vision. We should go back to ancient Greece, study its holistic version of life. Where everything flows. Thank you. My beloved Ilse made this exhibition especially for her. Sorry for the mess, but the medical center laboratory was in worse shape. I heard you will see Einstein. Yes, next week. He is very interested in the temperature rise inside the accumulator. We need to bring him some solid proof. - Would you like to accompany me? - It would be a great honor. - How's the legal stuff going? - I almost solved them all. Look, I just wish your work wasn't disproved like a charlatan's delusion, after all we are playing no more and no less than with the origin of life. So that as long as you can bring proofs of your findings... Do you see, Dr Reich? It is quite obvious that the majority will not even listen to it. And least of all he will believe her. But orgonomy is not about believing, it is about observation and experience. Yep, cancer is a disease these days that is frightening everyone so that if he really can develop a method of dealing... Sr Hills, look, our traumas are like giant rocks in a river deep in the valley, while the life is the boat that floats in this river. When the water level is low, life has to take evasive measures and carry out complicated maneuvers to navigate less dangerous areas. But when the water level, the energy, rises again, life can increase its speed and cancer is probably neither more nor less than the energy of life in a process to fight against restrictions and pressures. Einstein can help a lot. Einstein says that if it were possible to understand what happens in the accumulator on increasing the temperature without the use of other energy, it would be a bomb for physics. Let's hope he's not too busy with his bombshell. If I'm not mistaken, he's doing nothing to stop it. Many thanks for the delicious lunch. He'll go back to work now. If they allow me. Dr, can you take a look at this? Fantastic! Have you tested enough samples? I looked at the six taken from C23. What did you survive the cancer that killed all the rest of your family? Don't you think Hills is more concerned with his career than with our research? Wilhelm, he's a lawyer, what did you want? It just does its job. And you? You are my choice. You are happy? I am happy when you are. Are you nervous about the Einstein thing? How much I wanted a partner like you. I know your wishes. The payment for a new lab equipment, the new payment for Mice... We go to a party sometime. - What would someone like me do at a party? - To dance. We can dance here. Where is it! I want to know it! Thomas... Thomas relaxed. Okay Paul, he's your patient. In cases like this, surgery is the only solution. But if he is not yet 18. Let's give it another chance. To who? To him or... to you? There is no reason to be nervous. Would you like to tell me your name? What do you write on that piece of paper? I wonder if you'd like to tell me. E 'Thomas W. Harford Thomas? Well, would you like to lie down and breathe a little with me? I know at your age it may seem strange, but let's try. Ok? S. Don't you want to know how crazy I am? Or just lie down. Who knows who is really crazy? Lying. And breathe. Okay, just give me some pills so we can all relax. Breathe. Open your throat. Don't try to force anything. Breathe in... breathe out... - I can not. It hurts. - You're on the right track. Do not be afraid. You can die of fear. Fear of the truth, fear of life... Keep breathing. The problem is up here! Go to hell! Talk like my parents. Keep it going breathe, let all your anger go out. But don't stop breathing. What does he do? He's killing my son. Back. Mr. Thomas come and help me. Oh my God, you must be crazy. What kind of insane are you? They should arrest her. Poor boy. I'm sorry. It was a mistake to bring the parents too. That's what the law says. Your patient is not schizophrenic. Only extremely neurotic And short of breath. I don't think I can continue like this for much longer. My work with her and my work at the hospital. You have to learn to create your own path even when conditions get tough. And what is it that will save me from collapse? Dr Reich, please don't get up, I am Dr Bargman, Dr Einstein's assistant in theoretical physics, I have studied his ideas and unfortunately I have to tell you that you are wrong. Its accumulator has no physical effect. And speaking of his energy, what do you call it? However, it can not be proven. And the positive effect of the treatments can be pure coincidence, nothing more. Physics is an exact science unlike psychoanalysis, if you understand what I mean. Is Einstein of the same opinion? You call it emotional, which makes it difficult to understand however, they have a problem with the term "amory" which has no synonym in English I know because I found out. Tell him to translate it as I did in German. Yes in German is the perfect term. Isn't it wonderful up here? We should build the lab there. With large windows, so we could use sunlight all day. We can't pay for it. We have to. What conclusion did he arrive at? To continue, what else. Einstein supported the construction of the bomb. This is my mission. I believe that the fear of the world cannot be done away with with weapons of massive destruction. - So that he doesn't try anymore? - No I went on without his blessing. We are entering the atomic age where fear is the most powerful weapon to manipulate the masses. It is a race for dominance with a high cost. Gentlemen I am not a politician nor a soldier, I am a scientist but I understand how pressing the situation is. Thanks for your understanding. But now please get to the point. I have worked with schizophrenic patients for several years, and I determined that by erasing his memory we were causing the symptoms to disappear. Were you erasing his memory? Schizophrenics? What are you talking about? I'm talking about a therapy that can make your prisoners of war allies for life. In relation to your men, I'm talking about therapy which frees them from erroneous forms of thinking. Go ahead, please. The race to conquer the human brain together with the nuclear race, will determine our future. And it seems that the Communists have already started. If we want to be fast and efficient, we must learn from our enemies and forget morals and ethics. And as long as we continue with the fear of the red threat, we will have the population on our side. I assume the CIA has already received green light from Washington for this research project. We found this hospital at the Canadian university where we can start the program outside the United States. Here in Canada? Gentlemen, in my view, intervening in the processes of the human brain it does not go against the Hippocratic oath. No, I don't want this! Let's listen, please! In recent years, the crop has simply dried up. Only three years ago we could grow blueberries from here to that hill the soil is dry, and can be seen in blueberries. Sees this movement of the air from there, this is dry heat, it's strange. Now look there. Do you see the difference? That hill is what saves us, it acts as a wall for the climate. If it weren't for this... Do you see what I mean? Dust... there is no life here. Let's take a look at this and offer you something. I will drink too, I insist. Sally, bring the blueberry brandy. Sally, this is our neighbor Mr. Reich. He's a doctor and some kind of inventor, right? Do you have children? She cannot have children. Sally, why don't you bring our guest something to eat? Thanks, I'm fine. This brandy is truly special. It has something exquisite. It cannot be compared with what was obtained a few years ago, but it is what there is these days. Sally, go get a bottle for the doctor. As a doctor, of course, and if I'm not indiscreet, what reasons did they give for his infertility? What does it refer to? God decides whether we should multiply our seed or not. Of course, life is truly a gift from God. Years ago my wife had a miscarriage with some complications and that was all. In my country I treated many couples who wanted to have children but who had lost hope of having one. You're not one of those voodoo doctors, are you? I am referring to the fact that I see people as an integral part of nature, in the same way that she sees the fertility of the soil. It is very hard work. I know you work hard. It is another reason to take care of yourself. Come with me. Try to sit in it for half an hour a day. You both have to come to me for the next few weeks so we can take a look at these plans. Thanks for the brandy. I didn't know your father was that famous. If these crates are as hot as it says here. Where do I sign? "The Man Who Enclosed Sex in a Box." Orgonon Institute for Life Force Research. Did he want to tell me more? - No, I don't really know anything about it. - Says nothing? Look, I don't know anything, they 're reserved. What did you hear about these speakers? I don't know, ask... - It is free? - Yes. Look, I don't know anything, okay? Ask Beckys they will be able to help you. Well, where do I take her? I want to go to Orgonon, Wilhelm Reich's place. Incredible, what a coincidence: That man was just asking about Dr Reich. Hey, he's not gonna be one of those communists, is he? What does it mean? Nothing, I was chatting. Looks like a miss but place. Bah, appearances can be deceiving, you know? What do they say about the doctor? Okay, I have to shoot here. Come on, tell me, for my protection. They seem to be researching who knows what. All these who escaped the war in Europe, Why the hell do we have to let them into the country? Here we are, I have to stop here. I'm a dollar and fifty. By the way, I am one of those who unfortunately survived the genocide. Keep the change. Good day. Lo chiamano Dr Frankestein. During our life in society they teach us to fear this, the reasons are many and we will return to these later, but the result is that little by little we develop blocks we limit our feelings to keep them safe. And in the end we are afraid of perceiving in our hearts so much sadness as if it were pleasure. And soon we put on armor, the problem is that our organism has to expand and contract continuously, like a... Yes, like a jellyfish. And when we try to stop it, we create diseases. Dad. Eva? Eva... Actually I immigrated here with my mother ten years ago. And you haven't contacted me until now? Wilhelm, you have a consultation. She is my daughter. Eva. Oh hello. Please show her everything. Sorry, my patients are waiting for me. We had a dog like this when I was little. Your dad loves Winston, he's the best watchdog I've ever had. I wonder how long they'll let him live. It seems clear to me that we don't have the friendliest neighbors in the world. I had the pleasure of hearing a few stories from the taxi driver who brought me here. Welcome to Frankestein Castle. It is very beautiful here. Your father has fulfilled his dream of studying life as close to nature as possible. Emotions and physiology correspond energetically speaking. Look at this, it's a scientific case. An important research for the discovery of vital energy. The orgon. Have you heard this term before? No. Sorry for the interruption, but these samples need to be evaluated. Sure, Aurora. May I introduce you to the Dr's daughter, Eva? - Hi. - Hi. It must be amazing to be the daughter of such a fantastic father. Surprising, she said it. - Why don't you show her the rest of the lab? - Of course. Thank you. S. Orgon. Your father uses the term orgon to refer to energy already known by the Chinese as "Chi" for hundreds of years. The point is that these people didn't need any proof of its effects. - Can I ask what do you do? - I study medicine. Ah understood. Dr Reich has made his dream come true here in this paradise perfect for the study of life. As close as possible to nature. What are these crates? - Can I see one? - Of course. How do they work? In fact, the search for orgon is connected with the observation of. So, why don't you get an idea first? What should I do now? Do what for many people is really hard to do. Anything. At first, I thought this box did absolutely nothing. Instead, the more days passed the better she was and then this thing... you tell him, Sally. In short, after the third or fourth time in the accumulator feel this pain in the belly. And I had to run to the bathroom and that thing came out. I think it was time he wanted to expel this unwanted guest. S - How are you now? - I'm starting to recover my strength. Dr, how does this thing work? The accumulator activates the body 's power to repair itself. And thus being able to expel foreign organisms. Repair yourself. To put it in some way. I think we need to get back to your abortion. It seems to be bothering her. It was years ago. We don't think about it anymore. Sr. Murphy, would you let me talk to your wife alone for a moment? Sometimes it's easier that way, And you should only speak for yourself. Okay, the doctor is you. He will wait outside. Anyway, I thought this chest of hers was a crazy thing, but maybe I was very wrong. Mrs. Murphy tell me exactly when you lost your baby. Six years ago. But we never called him a newborn. I think even if it was just an embryo, it was still a human life. That he could hear and God knows what else. We tried for years to have a baby, we already had the name if it was a boy. - Ah, the name already? - Yes. He would have called himself after my father, he died when I was a child, and the baby is dead too. May I ask you, do you love your husband? We've been through hard times. Per s. I only ask because love is important in order to have a child together. So you packed your bags in record time like your father. As an immigrant, you want to get out of there as soon as possible. What do you think of the accumulator? It makes me incredibly hungry. Your father had a correspondence with Einstein for research on orgone energy. But at the end of the war, it didn't seem like the right time. Times have always been difficult for my father. It is always like this for a person out of his time. We are now in the Einstein era. A nuclear war hangs over our heads like a sword of Damocles. Don't be so pessimistic, nuclear energy is very dangerous but it must be accepted that it can offer good possibilities. You weren't so open about accepting things before. There are times when acceptance is necessary especially in those when there is no way out. But in your past? Is that why you are here? To condemn me for my past? Eve I am really glad you are here. I'd like to show you something, come with me. This room is laminated with metal. It is basically a great accumulator. I have found that sexual desire is only an expression of a more fundamental energy. Would you turn on the light? I am afraid of breaking something. Your eyes just have to get used to the darkness, in a minute you will see well. I feel like I can listen to my internal organs. And what is this? The vacuum tube. After charging for two months, we discovered this luminescence which could be proof of the existence of orgon. Or even that the void isn't all that empty. An energy that penetrates everything, including the outer space. It looks so alive. How are you? Well enough, I think, he's starting to trust me. Did you find out more about the sex chest? His hypothesis is that most people suffer from sexual blockages so that the first reaction in the accumulator is almost always of a sexual nature. Oh yes? What do you feel? Many of his patients report a noticeable improvement in their health using the accumulator. It has even been successful in cancer patients. But you can try it yourself and prove that the accumulator has no practical effect. What does it refer to? Making sure they are used for too short a period in each session. He has to go. The dog is always close to him. What are you doing here alone? I wanted to get some fresh air. Do you like trees too? - Yes. - They are true wonders of nature. Winston, come here. I can? I am a smoker. Obvious. I love this earthly feeling. I smoke too much to be honest. Yes, yes, it quickly traps us. But it shouldn't replace breathing. You have difficulty breathing because it does not feel flowing here. Dr Reich, I'm here to establish your mental state and not the other way around. Clear? Do you want something clear? Too much control, too much stiffness can make her sick. Dr Reich, I'd like to understand. Then read my books if you can still find one. If there is any that has not yet been burned or confiscated by your government. In Europe it was the same, but not for my research, but because I'm Jewish, I'm a communist here, of course. They made me burn my own books. It is a scientific question. Normal science research on dead tissue and dead blood samples, a necrophilic society. Instead I study on live blood samples, and then I ask you: Who has the best data on life processes? Who is the madman here? Wilhelm Reich or society? If her comfortable life means anything to her, then she should want to know. Hi Thomas, how are you today? Can you see yourself in the mirror, Thomas? Do you know what day it is today? The street name of the school you attended? You're not going to school these days, are you? All of these questions are hard work. Would you like to go back to sleep? Only 12 weeks after inducing him to a deep coma and a few electroshock sessions, this patient is almost back to his childhood. Can you explain to me why this should be a great success? Because it shows us that we are on the right path. While traditional psychoanalysis removes one veil at a time, with my therapy we drill directly into the patient's core. And then, Dr? What do you expect to find deep within the core? A blank blackboard, an empty space on which nothing is written. We will soon begin the second phase. - The second phase? - Division of personality and reprogramming. Starting with the blank blackboard. This is what you wanted, is n't it? I hope you can follow my explanations and so ask her for 2 mg of radium for these urgent experiments. And I also hope that the Atomic Energy Commission wants to cooperate in this work for the neutralization of the negative impact of radioactivity. Good morning Peps. Did you sleep well? What do you think of your sister? I saw her at the lake. She is a good swimmer. Yes, when he was your age, we often went swimming in lakes in Austria. You don't have to be jealous. We will have a lot of fun together. Maybe you have to go, or the school bus will leave without you. - I can get there earlier. - Yes, I know. You are a super runner. 1..2..3 .. Or. - Good morning. - Good morning, Eva. Have you heard these noises? Like deaf explosions... Yes, they are also experimenting in this area. - Who is experiencing what? - The military, the government. God only knows what they're up to. Too bad Einstein didn't support you. - If you say so. - I think he has raised the white flag for some time. What makes you say that? Something I read in the letter you sent to Freud. I remember the correspondence, but you were small at the time. What did Einstein write? He wondered if humanity could live without war. And what did "super Freud" answer him? That there is no hope for it. That humanity is basically trapped between love and hate. This pessimism started very early. Yes. How did you get these letters? Okay, you know my mother and Anne Freud are still friends. I see. Eva, I think you have to get this Anna Freud out of your mind. You have to rethink which side you are on. What do you want? That it breaks all contact with my previous life just because you had to do it in your past? I don't think he can ever surpass that of Freud, there is always someone who wants to destroy it, especially this Anna Freud, even here in Eeuu. I know. But I can't be forced to pick a side again. So that is, after all, for the rejection of Freud. I have left traditional psychoanalysis a long time ago because I don't think so billions of neurotics can be healed in this way. Therapy is powerless when it comes to these numbers. See you later. All functionalism exists outside of this theater has its roots in the meadow, Our pursuit of the purpose of life challenged only by the man on stage, while in nature the purpose of life. It is simply perceived as connectivity. Lei I'ex assistant del Dr Reich, no? Indeed. I am Dr Hamilton. The forensic psychiatrist. What can I do for you? Dr Reich resists being examined, I would like to help him, but... Eva, this is Dr Hamilton, the psychiatrist who assists your father. Signorina Reich. Do you know what caused the accident with the Radio? Is this part of your job? I understand your suspicion but I cannot speak to you about this. So why is Dr Hamilton talking to us? On the surface, people use an artificial self-control mask and they strive to be courteous. This mask is used to hide the second layer. Thank you. The Freudian subconscious, where sadism, envy, perversion, etc. I'm the normal aspect, the second layer is the artificial product of a culture with sexual denial and in general people are not aware of it, and this takes shape as a desire in our emptiness. Dr Hamilton? Hello, this is Peter Hills. I'm the State Attorney of Maine will be part of the trial by the FDA in the trial against Wilhelm Reich. - Cigarette? - No thanks. Dr Reich is a fascinating case, isn't he? I mean... From the pathological point of view I would like to see it once again. I don't know, he doesn't want to talk anymore. It may be, but I'm not done putting together the data for my report yet. Dr Hamilton, the subject is clearly a fool. Is this not enough for you? I don't want to discard any possibilities. Including his participation. You know, I can send you a dozen maniacs all sure that they have been falsely accused of some conspiracy theory but that doesn't make them better people at the end of the day. Well, I hope I can close the case soon. Can I show you something? Just a minute. - What? - The letters are very interesting: The American Psychoanalytic Association thanks the FDA for his commitment against Wilhelm Reich, whose theories and experiments are completely unrelated to our work but that however, unfortunately, we cannot be able to control or prohibit them. The Atomic Energy Commission wanted to show its gratitude for the success of this one cooperation and reiterate how important it was to get Reich out of circulation. Individuals like him pose a threat to American society. Signorina Reich. Is it a coincidence? I followed her from the FDA building. Hills has the letters and will use them as soon as possible. - Where did this book come from? - From the archive of course they always have a copy, even when it was they who imposed these books on fire. What can they still do to attack my father? What's up? Counter-analyzes are very hard in our culture. The biological system of the human species has been ruined for millennia we do the damage immediately, immediately before and immediately after the birth and those are the first bricks on which life will be built later, in childhood the child refuses with a big NO, a No that conveys the lack of opinions, people are as if dead, disinterested, demoralized, and then develops a pseudo-contact which he calls friendship and then it becomes a system that destroys human dignity rotting with a whole series of duties and orders. In short, what did you begin to experiment with the Radio? The experiments with Radio in the accumulator had already begun when I returned to Orgonon. Your father went to the Atomic Energy Commission to present his results. To the Atomic Energy Commission? What relationship? He says the atomic experiments carried out all over the country are a great threat for humanity and the nation and that we cannot even imagine the damage. Its premise is that radium orgone therapy can come to contain and also neutralize the atoms of Radio. You are blood of his blood. I can't take it anymore. Ilse. Don't get me wrong, I still believe in your father but I guess I'm starting to hate him. How do you live beside a martyr? The bank says it closes his account and he keeps dreaming of saving the world. You need a rest. I can not. I have to work tonight. What do you have to do? It's strange that she didn't react to the medicine, how exactly did the accident happen? We were working with small doses of Radio but she couldn't stand it. Never heard of the radio doing any harm. Maybe I need to notify my watchmaker. You see? People are ignorant of how harmful radiation is. Including ourselves? Poor Eva. I should have been more careful. Maybe to all of us. I love you Wilhelm, but I must leave you and Peter comes away with me. You love and respect your parents and your country you are proud to be North American, you are willing to do everything you can in order to preserve our core values. You love and respect your parents and your country... It seems that the state of regression takes longer than expected. We will discontinue the drugs for now. Excuse me, Dr, but I'm not sure I can handle it. I take the responsibility. Dr Cameron? I'm the FDA agent Klein. You, as a presidential member of the American Psychiatric Association, maybe you can help us con il suo collega Wilhelm Reich. Dr Reich? No, he has never been a member of our Association I only know a few anecdotes about his absurd theories. But wouldn't it be fair to say that these absurd theories represent a danger to the morality of society ...? Orgonon Two weeks after the accident. The Life Energy called Orgon does not exist. And Dr Reich's accumulator only proved its futility. Anything related to this theme remains prohibited. So he had a brain attack. This is what the doctor said, but in reality he thought he had received an electric shock from the overloaded pipes. I took him to Paul's hut to take care of him. Father, you should be lying down. The doctor said you should rest. You are probably the most difficult father imaginable. But also the most interesting. I found this in the can, a court order. - What forbids you... - I know. How will I explain my orgone energy to the rest of the people if they also deny me my request for a group of expert scientists? But why at least don't you show up in public? Because I don't have time for these games I have to gather my thoughts and put my ideas on paper. Have you seen the dark cloud over Orgonon before? My father is obsessed with his idea of dispelling this unusual radioation on Orgonon. Are you talking about Deadly Orgone Radiation? Yes, DOR, at first he only came back for short periods of time but he soon began to study the atmosphere and began to develop the CloudBuster. In fact, I was hoping you could explain just that. I couldn't find anything about this in my archives. Dr Reich? He had the device built starting from his drawings, at first none of us knew what it was. Something'? I'll call "The Spaccanuvole". The sun hasn't appeared in weeks, only clouds. Are you saying that the hole in the clouds is the work of the pipes? Yes, yes. Although it is important that the tubes continuously touch the agua during the process. Paul, what's the problem? Eva believes that everything is over after this court order. Come on, what harm can this order do? Look, see? Can you see it? Hi. - Where have you been? - A Orgonon and I return immediately. - Is there anything to eat? - I'll make something. - Father, please don't go there alone. - Alone, he will go there alone. Don't worry, be careful. You know what? I suspect we're not the only ones who have had a radio accident. What makes you think so? I was talking to Sr. Murphy, the farmer, they had a great drought. And when did it start? Exactly when the government began experimenting in our region. Ah, and his wife Sally is pregnant. I need to know how the wind moves. Dad, please, they've already hurt you a lot by boycotting you as a doctor. I don't care what other people say. S what matters. May. Maybe I'm the daughter of an eccentric man but I don't want to see how you isolate yourself even more. Please thank Paul for letting me stay here. I have to go. Radiation Hazard Access ONLY WITH Green Signal. James, tell him the Eeuu government will now convert this great destructive force into something good for humanity... We haven't heard anything more about you. What do you know about this car? He wrote to me about it but I'm afraid you'll have to put someone else on this case I studied biology, I have no idea what he's doing there. You are an immigrant bitch, which makes you the perfect person for it. Find out more about this machine. Looks like he 's about to come up with something dangerous. And find out what conclusions he arrived at with the Radio experiment. Excuse me, who are you? The Atomic Energy Commission is also interested in Dr Reich. Tell them that all that is in God's hand can only be good. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... I'm afraid there is only pasta. It will be perfect. Chianti. A nice Italian evening. Can't you hear? I mean in the air. I thought you would answer my question. Apparently everything is involved, the earth, the air, the animals... At the moment I am interested in the betrayal of Christ. Why are you here? There is no one here. I'm sorry I'm a little upset. I came because the world is not treating you fairly. Maybe I should leave it all alone. Northern Lights. Sometimes this phenomenon is also visible in the sky here. Have you ever wondered what these lights really are? A cosmic burst of orgone energy when the atmosphere is fluorescent. It's getting late. October 3, 1954 I'm sitting here in Orgonon, alone. Everyone left after the accident. The only witness here is this recording machine. After these decades of effort in the search for orgone energy all the time, money and blood, there is no soul who truly understands what is really going on here. There is no soul who truly understands what is really going on here. E 'lei il Dr Reich? The gentlemen came without warning. Who are you? FDA, we have an order, we don't have to notify you. For civilized people it would be an automatic thing to do. But perhaps this certain type of behavior can no longer be expected today. Dr Reich, we came to see if you are using the accumulators. Of course I'm using them. I can't stop my searches. According to this order, we must order her to put out the batteries. I thought the order said they are totally useless. He says that their existence is not allowed in any way. We are only authorized to monitor the situation I must ask you to destroy the devices in question yourself. Paul, bring the books. Is this what you want? Dr Reich, we only do our duty. Your duty... your cursed duty. What I don't understand is why your father risked everything for the climate experiment I'm referring to the fact that, it 's trying to make it rain. The peasants believed in him. And he really made it rain, saving the crops. Dr Hamilton, it is not true that we see what we believe until we lose control in the face of total chaos, and then finally we can see something new? Paul, let's go to the desert. I had never come here to this part of the country. Not worried about the nuclear test area? You say this because the air could be contaminated? No, I say this for our experiments. Who tells us we don't generate a similar effect to what happened at Orgonon? We are not that lucky. Who needs luck when he has Dr. Reich at his side? Please, Paul, let's just try not to make it go wrong this time. I am here because I want to help him but above all because we have to take care of him. And you have to help me. Hi friend, are you looking for flying saucers with your grandpa? How did you find out? Please don't tell anyone, otherwise the trip will be in vain. Ok father, the way you managed to make it rain there is a possible relationship between the pipes and the water and I understand that the pipes can pass and create water inside the clouds, but here we are in the desert, there is no water, what do you hope to do here? - I do not know. - You do not know? I don't know, but that he doesn't know doesn't necessarily mean he has no idea. I want to stay open to observe the development. - Thank you for coming. - I do not understand anything. I know how much you love my father. Not just your father. Okay, I know you love him more than you love me. I can accept it. To love is above all acceptance. Except for the inexperienced. Where is your sister? I do not know. You do not know? Not knowing doesn't necessarily mean having no idea. We thought you were sleeping. I could have had a cerebrovascular attack, but I'm still here. We had no doubts. It gets dark earlier these days. Don't get too attached. Come on Peter, I promised your mother I'd bring you back. Please dad, I want to stay with you. Come on, we'll go on an expedition together soon. I promise you. - Agree? - Yes. I had to see you. What is this? Will you tell me how it works? - We have time? - Sure, that's why I'm here. Sometimes I have the feeling of being firm in all of this and that everything I've lived for has been completely invalidated. The future will tell. Who was right and who was not. The future when? Tomorrow? In 10 years? In 1000? I am so curious to know where all this will lead us. The game of hide and seek is over, Dr Reich. I have orders to arrest you for disobeying a court order. He has to come with us. Judge... - Mr Judge, I'm sorry to disturb you. - All right. If you walk with me to the next hole, we can talk. - I read your report. - I wanted to talk about just that. He must put an end to this charade. He will declare that Dr Reich is not in the prime of his mental faculties but not because I believe it represents... So why? Between us. I'm sure he asked me for this report because he's sure he's innocent. A scapegoat perhaps. I don't think he's innocent, but I don't think he's a criminal either. I've always believed that judges give clear verdicts. What do you want? This case reeks of conspiracy. Dr Hamilton, why do you think I am here on a golf course and not in the court? I guess you're on a short vacation, sir. That's right, the longest vacation I could have had. They took off the Reich case and I retired. And that's exactly what I was referring to. Doesn't it seem strange to you that all these coincidences happen? No, I asked for early retirement 5 years ago in order to look after my sick wife. Unfortunately she died two months ago. I'm sorry. Sometimes we have to accept coincidences like fate. Well Dr Hamilto, do you have to add anything to your report? Only that I have tried to explain that Dr. Reich is not just a lunatic, even if he acted irrationally. I believe he suffers from schizophrenia and megalomania. So I believe he cannot be responsible for disobeying a judicial order. I believe that Dr Hamilton has spent a lot of time trying to accomplish his mission. Maybe too long. And I believe that he is no longer capable of objectively evaluating. For me it is very clear, there is no discrepancy between Mr. Reich's statements and his behavior. None. In this case, I declare the sitting closed. Dr Wilhelm Reich will be entirely responsible for his actions. - The trial will continue without any delay. - Why why? Listen, my work says... Thanks, that's all. You don't want to make this harder than it already is. But the accusation is wrong. And she too. Dr Reich does not respect our laws as colleagues we must stop the time bombs before they explode. But what if he was working on something big? Better forget all this nonsense. Cover your back, it can be risky for you too. In my worst days I ask myself what is the point at which the patient should be treated if it is already damaged from the beginning, an infinite cycle starting from early childhood. And this has happened for millennia through the birth and death of entire civilizations. But the ocean of cosmic energy, of orgone energy, follows its own course whether we are aware of it or not. Sick or healthy, even if humanity did not even exist. What is he writing? Who wants to know? You appear to be a suspicious person. Give me a reason not to be. Read your own books, you dream that children perceive without armor... I haven't been born yet today. Unfortunately. From a medical point of view, this can be considered a form of insanity. I'm Dr Cameron. President of the American Psychiatry Association. I know. I have always refused his request to join our association. Why did he keep fighting for it? Because you are a bunch of idiots. Leave me alone. I want to continue with this thing. They should have given her a fair trial. Wilhelm Reich was sentenced to 2 years in prison. On the morning of November 2, 1957, just before his release, he was found dead in his cell. They said it was a heart attack. No autopsy was granted. In 1957 Dr Cameron was asked to do the MK Ultra program for the CIA. A research program for the control of the human mind, and the basis for "Kubark," the CIA's manual of interrogation and torture methods. The techniques described in the book are still used today. Eva Reich carried on her father's work through her own work. He taught massage techniques for everyone and non-traumatic methods of birth for all pregnant women. She died in November 2008. Just 10 years after Reich's death , copies of his books were being read as compulsory reading for the generation of the political and sexual revolution. In memory of my friend Heiko Lassek.
