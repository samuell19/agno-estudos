February 12, 1938 the 16th year of Fascism. When my father was 20 he moved from Milan to Rome where he opened our store on the site of a tailor's shop founded by my great, great grandfather whose name was Pietro Melchiorri like mine. While the store of Lele's father, Sig. Leone is strictly ready to wear. It's been open for two years, ever since Sig. Leone left his brothers' drapery and quilt store and moved next door to us. Hello, hello. Hello? Radio Patrol HQ here. Was that you whistling? What do you want? I need help with a history problem. Is the Agrippa who made the belly speech the one who defeated Pompey and built the Pantheon? No, they were two different Agrippas. The first Agrippa talked tripe the one who defeated Pompey built the mausoleum. Got it. Agrippa-tripe, Pompey-mausoleum. You won't forget that. UNFAIR COMPETITION Did you see our neighbor's done it again? Now he's even stealing our signs. Go take a look. "Men's wear..." "...also children's wear". Thank you. Come back soon. Please remove that sign immediately. Which sign? - The one that says 'also' - Why? Because you can't use the word 'also' preceded by 3 dots. Must I remove the 3 dots? No, the word 'also'. It refers to my sign "Men's Wear". If I close my shutter a little your 'also' makes no sense. Great! Close it! Good idea! Peppino. Coffee! It's four o'clock. Already! I didn't sleep a wink. I'm depressed, Margherita. The only time I feel better, just a little, eh... is early in the morning, then I wake up. You never wake up early. When I wake up there's that moment of half light. Everything's vague. I'm not even sure who I am. That's a really good moment. Then, I remember... and I feel sorry for myself. Don't be so hard on yourself. You know the bitter paradox? I don't count much, but I'm still in the way. Didn't you say there was talk of a job for you? If I win the exam. There are twenty of us. What's my state of mind going to be? I have this terrible weight hanging over me. What's the exam for? A dance teacher... ballroom and drawing room. A cut of the inscriptions. - 8 p.m. to midnight. My two uncles are so different it seems impossible that they have the same nephew - me. Uncle Peppino's my mother's brother. He's kind of funny and he doesn't like to work but he's a great dancer. Uncle Angelo's my father's brother. He's a high school teacher. Sometimes he comes to the store in the afternoon and corrects homework with a red and blue pencil that he gives to me when it's down to a stub. He says it's quieter here than at home with my aunt, their three daughters his mother-in-law and two dogs. Sometimes he and Papà talk, sometimes they don't. Listen to this ninth grader. "The Ancient Romans of Italic descent" "conquered an Empire under their Duce." "Just like ours! Mussolini's the envy of the world." Five for the prose, minus five for the content, total zero! The prose is fine, the content's not so bad either. This damned regime has stifled all sense of criticism. We're becoming imbeciles... even children are pompous. What happened to humor? - Don't ask me. - You never know anything. - It's dead. - What? Humor. There are lots of jokes about the Duce. That's not humor. We laugh not to cry. - Excellency. - Good day, my good man. You look very well. Your coat's ready, Excellency. Your gabardine too, there's no better quality. It's the Prince of Wales' favorite material. We don't give a fig for the Prince of Wales' preferences. Not only is he British, he's also a well known pederast. In fact the word gabardine comes from "Garbardella" a 19th century Roman tailor. See? Everything great and beautiful - still belongs to Rome. - And surroundings. Could we try the trousers next? Careful. Do you know who that is? Yes. Someone to be careful about. Maurizio Totti Bastocchi... Italian academic. Our most famous brain. The country's master mind. Listen to this twelve grader. Did you know that Voltaire was a cheap philosopher and illiterate hack? Tell me later... Sorry, I'm embarrassing you as usual. I'll shut up. You don't have to. Just keep your voice down. Who told you about the origins of gabardine? It's common knowledge. Right. You made it up as usual. Common knowledge... gabardine I've seldom seen a coat worn so well at the first fitting. Oh, that's impossible, just impossible. Zero! Absolutely. The Duke of Aosta 2 button fashion, use the top one only. Let's go over there? After you. Ah, an expert's eye! Those shoes have just come in Spanish leather, English design, Italian workmanship. Here's the fitting room, with its own mirror. Papà! The suit! We have our own tailor's shop if it needs adjusting. See how slim he looks? The husband's the center of attention? What about his wife? Judith, bring out our Bemberg boleros? Don't you think the shoulders are a little stiff? Not at all. On the contrary... No, no, no, see? Where can you find softer shoulders than that? Good day, Signora Melchiorri. Good day Judith, Concetta... Did you notice? The street sweeper was late this morning. Yes, you're right. Well, back to work... goodbye. - She's so nice. - If you say so she meant I should wash the stairs again. Quality flannel... has a vertical nap. If the nap is horizontal the quality's inferior because it's calendered. That's all I know. I do my job as best I can... with honest dedication. But for the love of God, I overheard you the other day talking about "Le Corvuasie" - "Le Corbusieur" - What is "Le Corbiusie"? Actually, he's an architect I thought it was a cognac. I have to go, Papà, I have an exam this morning. "Basic Elements of City Planning." Good luck. You know all occupations are equally as noble. In fact, in the words of a famous English historian. It's the habit that makes the monk. - Really? - Honest. That's good. One can't know everything. But it's better to know as much as you can. I'm glad. Keep up the good work, we're proud of you. See you later, son. She's so good! A little louder now! Excellent! What a little monkey she is! Bravo! Vibrant! Softly now... Whirling, think of the waltz... Settle down... Now, take us with you, come along! Go on! Up, up, take us to the apex. Keep it up, we're almost there! When the teacher fell over I was the only one concerned for him. Apparently he faints often during his lessons. Chiaretta came in with a tray of pastries. And he felt better at once. From Paolo. A card and a leaflet. Should I give them to your wife? Thank you. - I like that striped material. - Nice, huh? Let's keep on looking. - May I help you? - We'd like to take a look. What would you say to a glass of wine? - Do you have time? - Absolutely. Then, let's go. We're going out. We'll be right back. The hat too? - Good morning. - Signor Leone. I put on weight again. I can't button it any longer. If you leave it, I'll let it out. It's not worth it. You let it out 3 times already - I'll make you a new one? - I don't need a new one. - Well, what's it going to be? - The usual sparkling white. - You still like it? - Yes, why? It's too sweet. It was father's favorite, remember? He made us try it at every opportunity I used to spit it out every time. Good morning, good morning. Who is that? A Pole or a Lithuanian. They say he's a Count. If he doesn't say so, maybe it's true. No, I wasn't being nosy. This was under your bed I swept it up. Try to be more tidy, but that's not the point. Yes, let's get to the point. She's certainly pretty, she attends the conservatory, but. There are two "buts". First: Once the decision's made, it's forever. I don't want your father and the haberdasher fighting again. Second... How many pretty girls with more class, more money are ready to fall in love with you and you with them? Why were you underwater? I heard every word. What did I say? She's certainly pretty. She attends the conservatory... - And after that? - After that what? "During the exam at the conservatory today" "I played for you, my love." "In front of all those musicians and teachers" "I wasn't nervous, I was just in love." "We were all alone, you and me in the moonlight" "I got top marks thanks to you" "I hope a beat or two of that sonata and my heart" "reached you. Yours forever." Can't you sleep? You woke me up. No, you weren't asleep. Neither were you. What's on your mind? Paolo. Don't worry, I'm just being a mother. Children grow up. They get new ideas, they get married. What's on your mind? We made 25% less this month. Who's getting married? If it will help, I'll cancel the new stole I ordered. That's not the problem. It's that haberdasher! It's all the haberdasher's fault. Do you know what he had the gall to say to a customer outside his store last week? He'd sold her a cheap coat and as she left, he said. "You look magnificent, right out of a dream" I should have added "Let's hope you don't wake up". When you think of the right thing to say too late it's called "L'esprit de l'escalier". Which means? That it came to you on the stairs after you'd left. Really? I'm glad. It's not a compliment, you know I'll cook that haberdasher's goose just you wait. Did the Duce make the Trevi Fountain too? No, he didn't do everything. Some things were there. May we have a baked pear, Grandpa? No, the Trevi Fountain's a little older Nicola Salvi made it 200 years ago. Come along, we're going to visit the Count. He's my friend, Waldbran Treuberg. Oh, don't call him "Tick Tock". He doesn't like it. Hello "Tick Tock". How are you? In fine fettle and very, very busy that's why your clock isn't ready. Meet the world's most unpunctual clockmaker. Grandpa says you have the world's smallest shop. Smallest? It's the largest. What else do I need? Better a cubbyhole... in your lovely country than a big store in Vilnius. Yes, the Count used to have a big clockmaker's store in his country with a valuable collection of antique clocks but then it was all destroyed. Who destroyed it? - Well, those... - Not in front of the children. Let's just say savage beasts! No need to insult the animal kingdom either. How wonderful! How lucky your children are to be Romans. If we had your sun in our unhappy countries maybe there wouldn't be so much brutality. For you foreigners the sun makes everything beautiful. This is Paradise! Ever heard of the Rome-Berlin Axis? Ever heard of the Italians? They sign pacts, but don't respect them. They never play by the rules, not even at cards I don't find that immoral. Be loyal... only with who's loyal. That's the Italian way I think it's the right way. That's why I'm happy here in my huge, immense shop. Typical, irresponsible Jewish humor. I'm not so sure... Your grandfather is a born pessimist, children. He sees catastrophe everywhere. - What language is that? - A language... that doesn't mince its words. Come along. Goodbye. 'Bye, children. Good afternoon, Excellency. Now we'll put this... at a little more of an angle. - Like this? - Like that. "Rock Bottom Prices." What about this? Too much eh? Now start... putting... - Draped like this? - Yes, I'll look from outside. Papà and Signor Leone had a short truce but all of us who read Salgari knew it was only the calm before the storm. Lele and I called the final clash "The Battle of the Seas". "Off to the Sea" "...to Play in the Waves." No charge to enter. How's it going? Your wife's inside. You're cashing in by copying all my ideas! You're hurting me. That sign's stealing my customers - I agree. - Thank you, Excellency. No! You're the one who's hurting me. Your Spring Sale is a month early. That's against the rules of trade, isn't it? You're trying to ruin me! I don't have to ruin anyone I have my own loyal customers. So loyal they change stores at the sight of a sign. - There! - There! You've been warned! Everyone off to play in the waves. After you, sir. The signs are not the issue. He has no sense... ...of business ethics. Damn! I should have said that! Our sign looks... brighter, happier. I'm not so sure. We even have a sea breeze. What can I tell you? Sig. Umberto's is more elegant... more chic! - How about the Sultan's wife? - Got it. Aramis? Got it. You know Dragonetti found... a ferocious Saladin. Lucky him. Take this Harlequin. I have two. Thanks. Does it hurt, mon trésor? He's an opportunist worse... than a crow. He's going to ruin us... There's nothing to laugh about. He changed his window display during the night. So did you, Papà I did it myself because I'm alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Let me spell it out! My brother teaches, my wife reads, my son studies... my brother-in-law dances and Umberto works. Dance is a psychological escape. Unfortunately I never studied it. If you like... I can help you, Umberto. Get away from the cash register! Go on! Umberto's had it! Umberto wants to study too. Then, we'll see who keeps the ship afloat. Nobody gives me a hand, nobody lifts a finger! I hoped I was being useful, Sig. Umberto. Not enough! See that lot there? They're a pack, they work together, they're ruthless. You don't give a damn. Go shopping, go on, go on! What the hell do you care. The first person who passes will help more than all of you together. The first passer by! Hey you! Do you want to be a clerk? How much does it pay? Ah, someone down to earth at last. 15 Lire a week. - If I say 16? - I'll say 14. I didn't say anything. It's a deal! Just call me Ignazietto. Hard worker, parents unknown, fast delivery service with my powerful Maserati... just kidding! What is cloth? It's, uh, it's a material. It's a weave of threads obtained from vegetable fibers like linen, hemp, cotton animals fibers like wool or silk artificial fibers like rayon. Cloth... varies according to weight, thickness, weft, consistency. It can be worked in knitted fabrics, patterns, different designs different colors... on a loom, a machine or a calender. What's a calender? A calender is a press for smoothing out rough cloth produced industrially. Quality cloth is divided into... That's enough for now... Sig. Umberto! I'm your greatest admirer. This afternoon, Lele's grandmother came to his house. The whole family turned out to celebrate her 80th birthday. Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins... and me. You can't have any... you're a diabetic I have to keep my sugar count up. No, Papà, you know you can't. Silence, please. Our granddaughter will play for us. Our granddaughter? She's the one who wants to play. Ah, what fun! What happy music! Grandpa's right, grandma. I never saw a grandmother play the violin before. You finished? Here it is, it's coming! Ready? What do you want? Give it to Paolo. I have one for you too. Where did I put it? I felt like a postman I read one of them. What nonsense Paolo writes! "Susanna, my love, every morning" "when I see your face at the window" "that moment is the joy of my life, yours always, Paolo". "EIAR, the Italian Radio Broadcasting Service" "presents the commentary of the parade" "in honor of Hitler's visit to Rome." Today, Uncle Peppino made his greatest mistake as a brother-in-law. He bought a ready-made suit from Sig. Leone. Take off those trousers! Leave me alone, you'll tear them I won't have a ready-made suit in my house! It's your fault. He refused to make me a suit! That's true. He's supporting the competition with my money. Your brother's not only a good for nothing, a traitor! He's a viper in sheep's clothing. Come here! Please, calm down! Today's a public holiday. Take off the coat! - You brute! - Buffoon! Who's the victim here? Who's the torturer? Take it back! - Why? It's paid for. - We don't want it. We don't take merchandise back especially when it's been adjusted. The gentleman's right. When you sold that sponger the suit you must have known you'd offend this gentleman's honor. Give him the money. That's not the point. No? Father's right, father knows best. Here, 280 Lire. Keep the money, spend it on medicine for all I care but don't ever call my brother-in-law a sponger again. Then why not let him buy what he wants where he wants? - Because it's my money. - You're contradicting yourself. Yes, peace and goodwill. You're the contradiction. When lost for words, say the first thing that comes to mind... You know who does that? Hotheads do. Who's a hothead! Watch your tongue, all right? Here, take your money - and go away. - We're being highhanded, eh? You arrogant scoundrel. - Who's a scoundrel? - You! Get out of here! Don't touch me! I warn you, I can be a raging bull. You are an animal! Profiteer! - Big nose! - Tightwad! - Sluggard! - Cheap Roman! Hulk! - That hurts! - Say: I give up! Throwing your weight round in my shop, eh? You making us look like shit, Papà? Yes, Papà, you make us look... like Paolo said. A Jew's always a Jew. A Jew? Well...? - When will you release us? - When Hitler leaves. - When's he leaving? - When he feels like it. Why have we been arrested? You're being detained as a precaution. Oh, sorry, I thought we'd all been arrested. Make yourselves at home, eh? Your behavior... Come in. Your scandalous behavior has disturbed the public order. And that's especially serious on this day of national pride marked by the visit of the leader of a friendly country. Melchiorri and Della Rocca, I tell you frankly... I won't lock you up only because you weren't caught fighting red-handed since the area police officer turned up too late. But Inspector, sir your deputy assigned me to escort duty while he confiscated evidence at the Paravia bookshop. Ah yes, of course! The Interior Ministry has ordered the immediate confiscation throughout the country, and throughout the Empire, of 'Black Love' by Maria Volpi, known as Mura illustrated by Du-Dudòvich? A love story about a Negro and an Italian girl. A work that offends the national dignity. Inadmissible in a country with an Empire in Africa. And this garbage gets published. Inadmissible, sir as you said, it offends the national dignity. Tramontana, Laosei, dismissed. You can go too. No, you stay here a moment. Was your difference of opinion, by chance provoked by something more... than mere commercial rivalry? In other words, should there exist a more precise reason for your dissent related to a difference in racial origins this office would feel obliged to defend at all costs whichever one of you is unequivocally and historically of Italian origin. Do I make myself clear? If you should have any secret information some important detail in this respect please fill in this questionnaire issued by police headquarters and return it tomorrow. I don't have any details to add in this respect. I don't understand you, but as you wish. Goodbye. - Hello, Boccio. - Ciao, Gnappé. - How's it going? - No complaints. At last the summer vacation arrived. As soon as school was out. Lele and I should have gone to the 'Dux' camp but this year, Sig. Leone didn't want to send Lele and I didn't want to go on my own. She's coming! Don't let her see you. Actually, it's fun staying in the city in the summer. Her stockings have a seam down the back. So do my mother's. - That's not the same thing. - You're right. The first time I came here with my mother she put a drop of perfume on her wrist and let my mother smell it then, she let me too I shut my eyes and felt dizzy. There's Miss Mathilde. 'Film' and 'Film illustrated' please. There you are, Miss. One ten. Thank you. Hey, the new 'Adventure' comic! May I see if it has the adventures of Cino and Franco? Gosh! Cino and Franco fight the cliff cannibals! 'Racial Laws' 'on the Cabinet agenda' "...forbidden to practice as a journalist" "doctor, lawyer, notary, civil engineer, architect" "to teach in schools, institutes, universities." "Other restrictions and seizure of property" "will be published in the official gazette." Just as well I didn't listen to my father. He wanted me to be a doctor, a lawyer. I could see this coming - since Hitler's visit in April. - May. Alright May, everyone fawning over him. Don't they have any brains? That shit Mussolini has apple cores in his head? I'll accept apple cores, but no names please. These are public premises. 'Evening, your Excellency. Apparently there are exceptions. Yes, for members of the Fascist Party before 1924 or for veterans of the Fiume campaign. Hurray! We'll all stay ahead of the game by applying! It's not so bad! In Italy they make laws, they don't respect them. That man is right, this is the land of exceptions like they say, the art of getting by reigns supreme. Where? What are you talking about? No more wine for the Count, Boccione he's drunk as a lord! No, I'm not. All I'm saying is that in Italy... everything's possible. For example. They want to rescind my trading license because I immigrated here after 1919. Tragedy? No, comic opera! I gave my last gold watch to a top foreign office official. He'll change the entry date in my passport. Or so he says. What do you think? Is it possible? If you ask me he stole the watch and you're out of business. That's possible. Next round's on the house. Don't worry you heard the Count. Everyone gets by in the end. There's Lele! Lele and Pietruccio! Come on in! Come here. Get a chair! You're out on the town, huh? Our friend's a barrel of laughs. What were you saying? That this country's full of shit. - Hey, I said no names. - Oh, shit's a name? That's her husband? - Whose husband? - The perfume seller's. - What are you saying? - Nothing. I dreamt about her last night. So did I. If he finds out! A drop for you too. 'Evening. Anyone seen my son? Come on, it's late, time to go home. A glass of white wine, Sig. Melchiorri? No thanks, it's dinner time. Finish your soda, say thank you and come home. Good evening. - Are you all right? - Never felt better. You always say that. Then, it must be true. You look a little down I'm not down. What do you mean? Your hand... Mamma mia, it's heavy. It's off too, think if it was on! Careful around the corner. I'm exhausted. That's enough, it'll curdle in its stomach. Hurry! It weighs a ton! Don't break the valves, huh? Hey, what's the matter? Come on, it's just a radio! I was looking forward to La Boheme on Friday. Don't worry, I'll sing it for you. If you don't watch out they'll confiscate you too. I'm going for a walk. - Name? - Romolo Di Segni. A Marelli radio set - 5 valves. - Who cares? "We have undertaken to erase" "to erase from the wall in question" "the words 'only idiots read'." Put it over there! Mazza, make out the receipt. Why are you here? Who's minding the shop? Susanna. Ready? "We did not think it opportune to remove" "leaflets stuck on the walls of some buildings" "with the declaration: A Jew lives here." "An anonymous gesture of approval" "of the restrictive measures adopted this year." "Nothing else. A Fascist salute" "signed Inspector Vincenzo Colligiani." Good day, sir. Excuse me, but I have a question. Why must we hand over our radio sets? Why can't a Jew listen to the radio? Does the EIAR... broadcast subversive programs, non-Aryan music? I demand an explanation. You're in no position to demand anything I demand an explanation. It's my right as a citizen... and as an officer decorated by the State for courage beyond the call of duty in the wake of the Messina earthquake in 1908. You're trying to make it a purely personal problem. I didn't pass the Law. There is an authority... "In defense of the race" above us mere pawns, that it is our duty to obey. You call that an explanation? Facts are facts. You're stealing our radio sets. No-one's stolen anything! They're in temporary custody. What about 'The 4 Musketeers'? Where can my grandson and I listen to it? Here? That's the way things are. You're wasting my time prattling about radio programs. - Don't you have a piano? - Until you confiscate that too! We have work to do here. If you'll excuse me... - Let's go, Leo. - Please! Talk about impudence! I'm astounded! So am I, sir. We're all astounded! I'd like something a little softer. This is our selection, I told you the prices, when you... Don't you have any pastels... like a pale blue silk? No. Nothing in pale blue, dark blue light blue, turquoise or periwinkle, so... Excuse me, I was just asking... politely. I'm telling you politely to try elsewhere. Good day. I see, very well. Signora Di Veroli... don't leave maybe I have just the thing, let me show you. This is a georgette... crepe de chine, feel how light it is, eh? In lilac... it hugs the body doesn't wrinkle... it's divine. I love it. See how it enhances... the color of your hair? It's perfect. And I'll give you a 30% discount. Thank you... it's for a chemisier. Measure off two and a half meters. How's your husband? Not so bad. He looked well the other night. - You look well too. - Yes, not bad. Wrap it up. That comes to 35 Lire instead of 50. Here's your packet. - See you soon. - You've been very kind. They never give discounts like that in their shops. They who? Oh, for heavens sake, you're the boss. You could have made it 40%, or better still 50. - Imagine losing your head over... - Over who? Well, she's a traitor. Apart from the fact that nobody's losing his head who on earth told you Signora Di Veroli's a traitor. Didn't you hear her? "It's for a chemisier!" It's called a shirtdress or a smock... Besides everyone knows they're traitors. Who gave the Spanish Bolsheviks money to buy guns? Who's been telling you all that rubbish? You should be better informed. Don't you know whitewashers are being exiled? - Who? - Whitewashers. I like the way you work, but not your conversation. Put the bolts away and hold your tongue. Alright? Me? All I said was... Silence! Do your work and be quiet! Anyway, if I... Bari, Catania, Ancona... by following Olympia, my girlfriend, I saw all of Italy except Switzerland. Why did Olympia travel so much? For her job. 15 days here, 15 there. And then? In Cecina one of her customers, a sleaze, stole her and I ended up in jail for political reasons. - What did you do wrong? - I punched the sleaze who was secretary of the local Fascist Party I could write a book. - And then? - I was jailed again... In jail I met men I admired, men with balls politicians, professors, doctors. Want to know why I never learned anything? I got the general idea, and I was working on it but they released me too soon. My detention period was up, so I never got anywhere. Oh, oh, stormy weather on the high seas. - Wait! - Leave me alone! Go back to your friends at the Caffè Esperia. For the love of God! Why were they trying to be so funny? Because they're idiots... you heard them. Of course I did. All that stuff about Jews. They were joking. It was just idle chitchat. Then why did they start it when they saw me? - They didn't know. - What? What? That I'm Jewish. Why didn't you tell them? Because... it doesn't make any difference. Nowadays it does... or you would have told them. Susie... you're just like anyone else for me. You're just like anyone else too. Good evening Sig. Umberto. 'Evening Professor. Something wrong? Nothing. My colleague, Elio Carpi... has to leave the school because of the new laws. He said goodbye today. He told us "At 50, I find out I'm not Italian". We told him that it hurts us to see him go. I gave him an 1815 edition of the 'Iliad' What does 'Ah' mean? What do you want me to say? You have to ask? Don't you know? Don't you have an opinion? Do you have to be told what you're supposed to say? Very well! Do as you always do. Eh? Just say what your newspapers say. All right? Everything's fine, everything's timely, proper under control, noble, patriotic, heroic... fated inevitable, incorruptible, imperialistic! Is it my fault? No. What should I have done? Protested under the Duce's balcony? Should I have resigned... in solidarity? And brought my family here for you to support? - As if you don't do enough already. - I don't do anything. Not true. Maria says you've been paying our mortgage. Hurray for the family, the Italian's scapegoat reliable, punctual, ever present. Are you happy now? What can I say? You're saying it all. Ah, yes! You belong to the silent majority. When they forced you to join the Party to renew your license, you kept your mouth shut. Remember these signs "No politics here"? Sure! We only talk sport! What about when they abolished the handshake? It was better... shaking hands is unhygienic. It spreads microbes, TB, typhoid, brotherhood. Yes, brotherhood! That's a joke! The Party forbids brotherhood. Period! You know what, Umberto? We're not brothers, we're Fascists. Once you told me to go to hell, now it's my turn I'll accept that. Maybe you're right. I'm confused. That's normal. I'm confused too as you can see. My cousin's fiancé at the police station at Ponte Milvio says they have an office for reporting Jews using phony names. No-one's been turned in yet. Let's hope they get reported in droves. Jobs will be easier to find. I might get one at last I'm qualified. Is it ready, I'm late? You're not qualified for anything, you sponger! You're not employed because you're incapable. You qualify as a parasite! You little prick! Ah, at last an honest opinion of me! He's always honest with you. Be reasonable, you know you irritate him. He irritates me, but I know how to keep my mouth shut. My day will come. I have contacts in high places I've applied to the right people. If I'm accepted, things will change in this house. Yes, just you wait and see! Wash your hands, it's suppertime. F. 5 Splash! Water! B. 2 Bulls eye! You don't know how to do it. Put your tongue between your teeth. Forget it. She doesn't go to the Conservatory any longer. Does the teacher who faints still give her lessons? I haven't seen him recently. Your turn. B. 7 Cod liver oil time I brought you some pastries too. Why was she crying? She has to go home. - Isn't she happy? - She doesn't want to go. Crispina's pastries aren't as good as this. I don't want to go. I love you all. All of you. How can I leave Lele? Please Sig. Leone, let me stay with you. How can you be so stupid? You can't stay, understand! Have you got sawdust in your peasant's head? Members of the Jewish race can't employ domestics who are Aryans. We can't have a maid who belongs to another religion. Is it my fault I was born a Christian? Is it my fault? Forgive me, Concetta, I love chicory sandwiches. My poor husband used to do the same thing. It was his favorite treat. Garlic and red peppers... sheer paradise! Signor Umberto. No offense intended, but... if the Duce forbids you to have a Christian clerk I'll go sign up at the synagogue I'm sure they'll take me. They'll put you in an asylum. Don't be stupid! The Duce says it's the Jews who can't hire Christians. And I'm the one who's stupid! "Victor Emanuel III, King of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia". "By the Grace of God and the Will of the Nation decrees". "No school of any order or grade" "may enroll students" "of the Jewish race". Hello, Angelo. What's the matter? "Accidental death of a teacher." "Prof. Elio Carpi late of the faculty" "of the Ruggero Bonghi high school" "died last Wednesday of carbon dioxide poisoning" "caused by a defective paraffin stove." Wasn't he your friend? "Defective stove" Ha! If you think it was suicide, then say I helped him. That he lit the stove with the "Iliad" I gave him. Don't be stupid. What are you saying? Everything is the result of cause and effect dwelling on the aftermath is pointless before the end there's always a beginning. Were we friends? No, I wasn't his friend if I had been, I would have been there. You've always had your own point of view. But facts are facts. Regardless of the point of view. Yes, points of view don't change anything. We have the courage of our convictions or we don't. Like me? Yes, if it helps you feel more intelligent than others, eases your conscience and gives you a steady income. But then you accept that people kill themselves so we're better off without your kind of intelligence. Look, better him, coherent, no alibis indomitable, predictable. At last some words of wisdom in this house. You've been converted... a sincere pat on the back. This is a time for pressing decisions. Rats and turncoats have had their day and so have neutralists... He says we have to clean house and we will. You can bet on it! Coffee, Angelo? Two coffees, Crispina. One coffee. This is my house not a café. Crispina... make coffee. My dear Margherita. Come on, Pietruccio... we're all at table. What are you doing in the dark? Darling... I'm sorry about Lele too. You can finish your Meccano bridge in the afternoon and do homework together even if he's changed schools. But why? In life, darling bad things happen sometimes. Luckily, we're Catholics. - Do you have a light? - In this rain? Mr. Peppino's become such a fine man, hasn't he? If you say so. He really showed what he's made of. He's just like Ciano. You see? Yes, don't you have proper shutters? Gratings... Why? So people can see the window when we're closed. It's obvious then. You want more, you risk more. There are idlers around with nothing better to do they see a nice window and... it's just a prank. You think so? It's obvious. Anyway we'll make out a report. We were all kids once... "He, who is without blame..." I'd say... this is an open and shut case. Who never threw a pebble at a window? - Here's the pebble. - See that? Just small enough to pass through the grate. Why give it to me? You call that evidence? There's no mystery here. Write... act of vandalism by unknown party I'd write: act of vandalism by unknown thugs. In this case "unknown party" means just that. There are no honest parties who are vandals, right? They're unknown, period! Do you think whoever did this is not a thug? Mind your own business. Go back to your shop! The rest of you break it up. Nothing happened. Come on, move along. Nobody's dead. Get 'em out of here, Tramontana! Good day, Signor Leone. Good day, Umberto. Is this how it started in your country? Who knows why the only time the Italians respect an alliance it's with the cream of all shits! But you Italians are different, you're not like them. You're just pale imitations. If you imitate a thug, you become a thug. Blockhead! You're the blockhead! The world has more Italian emigrants than Jews. That's why Italy can't consider... our presence illegal... like they do in Germany. Tell me something did they backdate your residence date? No, they took my license away. I have to close. But I think that with an extra tip the official who took the watch will return my passport with an American visa. With an extra tip, huh? Yes, I'll go to America and never see you again. Hey, you... just a second! How big a tip? At least 300 Lire. Ah, 300 Lire. Aren't you afraid they'll steal it? How can they? I don't have it. That's 300 I record everything, Jew, don't worry I'll take it straight to the official. Let's meet at the Viennese concert café - you can buy me a hot chocolate. - No, it's on you. Very well... His Excellency left it. Many shops show it already. "This shop is Aryan". Well, they're not my kind of shops. Get rid of that sign! Go on! I never want to see it again! I didn't hear you come in, Excellency. You were more concerned about a printing job. This is telepathy. Your carded cloth arrived yesterday. This is not the moment I came to pick up a bottle at the wine shop. Good day. He takes the car to go to the wine shop. 40 meters! Why didn't you say he was right behind me? You could have coughed, raised your voice to greet him. How could I? Your instructions are to keep my voice down in front of customers. While you play dumb, we've lost a loyal customer. It's all your fault. Oh, now it's my fault? I can't even open my mouth. Every word is used against me. A momentary distraction and they ruin you. Why? Because we want to be the Germans' toadies. Sorry, but where do the Germans come in? If the Duce does something, it's 'cause it's right. You think what's happening in this street is right? You think these idiot signs are right? Are separate hospitals, schools right? Is it right that Jews must hold their funerals after sunset? I don't give a damn about losing a good customer even if it's going to cost me dearly. You know what I think of you and your kind? You can drop dead, go to hell or worse if you like! You astonish me, Sig. Umberto I astonish you! Here, take your hat your jacket, your purse and leave. Instead of coming to work tomorrow go and report me to the shop clerk's guild I'll lose my license and that'll be it. Go on! Go! Here's Sig. Tullio's coat, the cutter says that... I went too far with... with the clerk. I fired her! - Oh no, with all her problems! - What problems? She supports her parents. Her father plays poker. So what? He's a compulsive gambler. Not to mention her love life. What? She's in love with you. Haven't you ever noticed? She says you're more handsome than Amedeo Nazzari. If she knew I told you, she'd kill herself. Maybe she'll kill herself anyway. Don't be like that, Signorina. Don't make a scene. Me? I'm making a scene! Sig. Umberto... Good evening. Let's go to my room I'm happy today. Out of the blue, Papà... asked me to go with him to see Sig. Leone who is suffering from an ulcer. You have a visitor. - What a nice surprise! - What a nice house! How are you, Signor Leone? Let's dispense with the formalities and start out on a first name basis. - Why not? - If you don't mind, of course. How are you, Leo? What's wrong with you? Heartburn, cramps. I might need an operation. But your visit has given me an appetite. Stockfish and chick peas for dinner, Judith. He's always joking. It's good to keep your spirits up. - May I offer you an aperitif? - With pleasure - I'll have one too. - You'll have a tamarind tea. - Lots of ice, a drop of water. - Lots of water, no ice. She's tough. Marriage contract. I don't smoke. Oh, goodness, Judith, you interrupted us! I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, he's joking. Cheers. You know something? Our Susanna and your Paolo no longer see each other. Did you know they were seeing each other? Yes, I mean no. You think they were...? It's probably just a lover's tiff, right? No, it's over. They were seeing each other, now they're not. Maybe Umberto understands that now, Judith. They were seeing each other, now they're not I'll leave you alone. Don't smoke! Me? Is your wife well? Yes, quite well. A little concerned about her brother. Why? What's he done? He shot himself cleaning his pistol in the barracks. Is it serious? Well... he does risk losing his foot. He didn't know what he was doing. The gun went off... and hit his foot. You know, he's just a... Sorry, excuse me. They're getting along like a house on fire. You can tell they've grown up. I have an idea. Let's hear what you think. They use administrative codicils and loopholes to force us out of business and then buy our licenses for peanuts. The Sermonetas closed, the mattress factory too now the Di Veroli perfume shop has closed. Our Count, the watchmaker closed. - He left. - For America? For an interment camp in the north. I didn't know. Where did Signora Di Veroli go? Maybe she just changed streets. Let's find her I've had an excellent idea. My store fittings, unsold goods, etc. you make a bid, I'll just say yes... Eh? But if you offer me too little, I'll say no Rome! Maybe I should have stayed in Milan. But I like this street. So do I. Even if you accepted peanuts... I'd say no. Why? Because the shop's yours, you have to keep it. Thank you... clothier! Don't mention it... tradesman! He's in good spirits, on the mend, eh? He's got nothing wrong. The doctor says it's psychological, just nerves. Then why can't he have an aperitif, stockfish? To teach him a lesson. How did Lele seem to you? He's fine. Why? He st-stammers a little then he ge-gets over it. See? I do too. Let's go. Say goodbye. I found this lightweight wool for you for your architecture exam. Try it on. A new suit for every exam? I have 15 to go, Papà. Well, we'll skip some. Try it on I want to see how you look. Button it. Perfect. How's it going with Susanna? A good match. She's nice, intelligent... Yes... that's why she told me to go to hell. Why? Because I'm a prize idiot, Papà. There are a lot of us around these days. Who's "ton beau commissaire"? Why speak French? If it's so Crispina can't understand, I don't either. My brother, your scapegoat, will be in hospital for six months. I hope that makes you happy, because I've had enough. - I'm always happy. - Sure! I heard you up here... when you were yelling at poor Mathilde. Even though she's in love with you she's the kind who'll report you I just hope they close down the shop next door. Once the Jew's gone, you can relax. Sig. Leone's shop is closed. His Excellency, Cavaliere Bonavigna bought it. They say he's going to open a jewelry shop I think His Excellency's feet stink. On Sunday I'll take Fang to see Lele at his Grandma's. She lives in the Ghetto in Via Della Reginella. We called the kitten Fang after Cino and Franco's panther. Fang's half mine, half Lele's. Forget it, it's always the same. The best people leave or go to jail. God Duce! God Duce? The Duce is God? No. God's God, Duce's a curse word. He needs rice and carrots once a week, for the runs I know. Grandma's house is already full up now we're moving in there's no room at all, if not I'd take you with me. It's a proven fact once you drink cod liver oil together you're friends for life. Translation: Nick Alexander Subtitles: Issaverdens Snc
