The Lord is the one who gives us life. And His love lights up the world. Give your hand to whoever's suffering, and give bread to whoever's hungry. Don't deny anyone your love, we always have some more to give. We have to build the Temple, Holy God, and here peace will always reign. We have to build the Temple, Holy God, and here peace will always reign. Marisabel. Marisabel. Guantanamera. Guantanamera. Kids, it's time to go to bed. Let's thank the Lord for this day, and don't forget to commend your souls to the Virgin Mary in your prayers tonight. But before we go to sleep, we'll sing "Praise the Lord". Let's see... Joaquin, give us the opening note. Praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise the Lord... DON'T TELL ANYONE Miguel... Miguel... I can't sleep. Say the rosary or count sheep. What are you doing? - Are you crazy? - I'm sorry. Please, don't tell anyone. Touch me again and I'll hit you. Please, Lord, help me change. - Hail Mary. - Conceived without sin. Tell me your sins, son. I've lied. What else? I failed the 4th commandment. I've been arrogant. Give me an example. My dad made me clean up after our dog, and it made me sick. So he started screaming, and I thought: I hope he dies. How could you, Joaquin! You have an obligation to love and obey your parents. They know what's best for you, because they've been blessed by the grace of God. Go on. I was idle. What else? That's it. You haven't sinned against purity? No. Never. You haven't abused yourself? No. Not once. You haven't had bad thoughts, impure desires? No. You're not lying to me, are you? Of course not, Father Armando. Good. Now, pray "Our father..." 15 times and then repent. Ego te absorbo.Amen. May the Lord be with you, my son. Take, eat ye all of this, for this is my body which is given for you. Look at him. Look at him. Likewise, after supper he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to all of them saying, "Drink ye all of this for this is my blood, of the new covenant... We're going to fake a fight. You can hit me anywhere above the waist. All I'm going to do is dodge the blows. - Are you going to hit me? - No. Hit me. Imagine I'm an idiot from school, a kid that gets on your nerves. Hit me. Come on. Too slow. Faster, faster, faster. Look up. At me. Don't laugh. Keep swinging. Come on. - Hey, you hit me. - Swing. Don't be a pussy. Don't waste your breath, talking. Just swing. Good, good, good. It's not fair. You're cheating. Who's cheating? Keep swinging. Don't be a wimp, boy. You're not even bleeding. Good. Good. Good. Good. I quit. You can't throw in the towel, you fairy. Pick up those gloves. What are you, a faggot? I don't like this game. What's going on? What did this beast do to you? Come back here. Luis Felipe! It's your fault he's like that, like a china doll. You've spoiled him. No. I just don't want him to be a womanizer like you. You hit him, you brute. He's 15, damnit! Can't you see that? What do you want, a faggot? Is that what you want? An indefensive and scared little fairy? I want a good man. What you want is for him to become a priest. They're all a bunch of faggots. Don't cry, dammit. Don't get on my nerves. Son... I think I went too far. Let me see. It's nothing. I'm alright. Your Mum wanted to call an ambulance. She exaggerates. - Son, it's for your own good. - Don't worry. I know I go too far sometimes. Want to go hunting this weekend? I don't know. We could hunt squirrels, deer, pumas. We'd leave early on Friday. I've got school on Friday. I doubt Mum will let me. We'll see about that. Joaquin! Joaquin! No smoking. No drinking. Remember: It makes the Lord cough and cry. Don't worry. I'm a big boy. Promise me you won't kill any animals. Bye, Mum. And if he asks you to shoot one, imagine you're aiming at Baby Jesus. "Imagine you're aiming at Baby Jesus." Only she could come up with something like that. Your mother makes me laugh with all that nonsense, but I'm worried about her brainwashing you. I only play along so she'll leave me alone. Thank God. I thought you'd end up a priest. Light one. I assure you, it's not going to give God cancer. Forget your old lady's advice. From now on, I'm going to be your teacher. Ready. Hold tight. Aim in between her tits and don't breathe. She's too far away. - I can't. - Of course you can. You know what the secret is? Pretend you're aiming at an Indian. Ready? Shoot! Did I hit her? I think I hurt her. You tickled her. Why do you close your eyes to shoot? Pretend you're kicking a penalty. But it's loud. What can I do? Don't give me that girlie shit. Here you go, sir. You want her closer? No. Bring the horses. We're going proper hunting! Hey, your Dioni's quite a man, huh? I can't complain: Good, obedient, hard-working and a hell of a shot. Is he good with his fists? Do you think he'd beat my boy? Your Joaquin's taller, but my Dioni's bigger and he's brave too. 50 soles to the winner. I don't fight, not for money. You don't fight, and that's it. Let's go. The boys can hunt on their own. Now. What are we doing here? We should be bathing in the river. Look. Here. No. I'd be too sad if I killed him. I'll kill him for you. Shit! Your dad'll be thrilled. Idiot! You killed him. Good shot. Who killed him? Your son, sir. Joaquin's good. He got him down with one shot. No kidding! Here, your first trophy. Bet it weighs 40 kilos. And I thought you couldn't kill a fly. That's my boy. There's nothing out here, as there are few women you have to look after your own needs. But you've been with a girl? Four times. With a cousin of mine. Just thinking about her gives me a hard-on, like now. Liar. No one gets a hard-on like that, in the water, - when its this cold. - I'm not lying. Look. You must really like her. Hmmm. She's fine, man, and she's got this body... ...and she moves... ...like she's got ants up her crotch. Look, I got a hard-on too. Hey, they're the same size, only yours is whiter. If you want to, you can touch it. Are you crazy? Men don't touch each other. Has she ever jerked you off? Yeah, like this is even better. I bet you I do it better. Men don't do that. No one has to find out. Let me go! What? Don't get upset. I was kidding. I'm no fag, man. Now you're in big shit. Where are you going? Dioni! Wait! You'll get it if you tell my dad. Yeah? You going to hit me? Please. He'll kill me. Joaquin! Joaquin! Where are you? Here! By the river! Let me go, you faggot. Let me go. Shut up, you idiot. Shut up. Tell and you're dead. Let him go now. Why are you hitting him? That's my boy. First you kill a deer. Then you beat up Dioni. One hell of a trip. That's for sure. You're a man, Joaquin. You deserve a graduation gift. A gift? Yes, a gift you'll never forget. That's for sure. Look out, Dad! I didn't see him. He's not moving. I think we killed him. Good. Serves him right. I caught nothing on the ranch, but at least I hit an Indian. We'd like to thank our beloved parents and teachers. We couldn't have completed this stage without you. We know that many difficulties await us, that we'll be tempted, but the things you've taught us will lead us down the right path. God and the Virgin Mary are with us. We swear by them to be good sons, good fathers, husbands, honest professionals and true Christians. You were wonderful. Don't you think, Luis Felipe? Now we have to go and give thanks to the Lord. Turn here. - What for? - To go to mass. It's a promise I made. We have to go. Isn't that right, Joaquin? No way. Joaquin and I've got plans for tonight. - Joaquin and you? - That's right. And me? You go to mass. The chauffeur will pick you up. Come on. Go! You're coming with me. Where? To give him his graduation gift. - What gift? - Let's just go. Tere, Rochi, Lolita, Chichi, and Lucy. I promised you five and here they are. So he can choose the one he likes best. What do you say, kid? They're all fine women. Which one do you like? Help him out. - You know them all. - Carmela? She works nights. We don't usually open during the day. How do you like them, kid? Skinny like Lucy. Or with a good pair of tits and firm ass. - I personally... - Drink up. You'll think better. Go on, Joaquin. Down it like a man. What's wrong? Are you nervous? The water's freezing. The boiler's turned off. Complain to your father. They'll listen to him. You're really cute. Here, finish your drink. It'll cheer you up. Come. What's wrong? I don't know. I don't feel well. Don't worry. It's always like that the first time. Come. Just let it happen. Come. Get on top of me. Just like that. There, that's it. Good, see? Come on, move just like that. You're doing fine. Just like that. I'll teach you, baby. Like this. There. Keep going. You're almost there, almost. I know what you want. Lie down, baby. What's the matter? Did I do something wrong? When I do it to the boys, they love it. Here. Drink some more. No, don't. I don't know what's wrong. I can't. Let's drop it. Why? You were doing fine. Let's try it again. Or don't you like me? You're pretty, but I don't know what's wrong. - It's my fault. - These things always happen. Don't worry. I'll jerk you off. I bet that'll get you going. No. I told my dad I didn't want to come, but he made me. What's your problem? You like men? Why do you say that? Don't know. No reason. But if you do, don't be scared. Follow your instinct. If not you'll really suffer. - You like them, don't you? - No. It's not that. You can't fool me. I noticed it as soon as I saw you. Poor thing... He's a fairy, but he won't admit it. Have you ever tried it with a man? Do it. You'll like it. That's quick. Did she scream? Come on, tell me. - Fuck off. - What the hell? Joaquin! Joaquin! The mid-term will be 20% of your grade and the final will be 40%. Now you know. You've had ample warning, so I don't want to hear any complaints. The group project will be 40% of your grade. And the deadline's a week before finals. Will we get a higher grade if we hand it in early? You'll get five points more, Miss Cisneros, considering the classmates you've gotten stuck with. Isn't that right, Mr. Camino? I'd like to thank you for being with me again for the second, no, third time. As for the attendence, we'll stick to the guidelines. 30% absence and you don't take the final. Make a wish. Happy birthday, Joaquin, from your loving parents. Nice Service. With you always. Happy birthday, darling. Did you like the surprise? Aren't they cute? You give them the address and that's it. They handle it all, even the champagne. But you know how I feel about alcohol. Yes. And you know I don't like birthdays. Don't be a party-pooper, son. Sit and try the cake. Mum, some friends are coming over. We've got a project to do. That's great, son. It's important you study. I know you're going to go far. You're so smart. I've got a surprise for you. It's from your father. It's your birthday present. Don't you see, son? He's been asking about you. He wants you back home, but he's so proud. Mum, the further away I am from him, the better. Don't say that. I know he's got his faults, but he's still your father. Don't start, Mom. - What should I tell him? - About what? That you liked the gift. I don't know. Anything... Say... thanks. You're an angel. Take care. - Hi. - Hi. - Don't you like parties? - No. I used to love them. When I turned 15, my folks threw a bash. But now I don't. I find them childish. This year I said: No parties, travel money. - Where did you go? - I wanted to see Peru, to really see Peru, because Lima's like Miami. So a friend and I asked a teacher for advice. How did it go? We never went. My dad decided it was too dangerous for us girls. What about your boyfriend, Carlos Larra?aga? That jerk didn't want to see Peru! So we went to NY and Boston. It was great. Listen, I don't think they're showing up. Let's start without them. Get your book. You want some wine? There's a bottle in the fridge. - When did you move here? - After high school. Your folks must be really cool. No. They bugged me so much I ran away from home. I told them I wanted to live alone, and they said "yes", but only if I studied Law here. Thing is I don't want to be a lawyer. You don't? Then what do you like? I like... your hair... your eyes... ...your body. Liar. I'm as fat as a cow. No, you're not. You're the prettiest girl at college. No way. I thought you were stuck-up, that you ignored me. - I'm shy. - I don't believe you. - I'm serious, not even a girlfriend. - No? What a waste! That's life, I guess. Nobody loves me. That's because you're not open. I know a lot of girls who like you. Some of my friends. They think you're hot. And you? What do you think? Oh, that's Carlos. I'd like you two to be friends. We could hang out together. Sure, whenever you want. I hate being rushed. I'll call you to make plans. Okay? Bye. This is how we study, man. We might not have the best methods, but our system's fucking cool. Clown. Give me some more. Easy. This shit is strong. It's like I've eaten 15 kilos of cement. Me too, man. - Hold up. - What's going on? Pull up... slowly. What's going on? A faggot. Let's get him. - A whore. - A transvestite. Check out the legs. And? We're going to kick his ass. See? Is he fag or what? Hey, beautiful. Hi, hon. What's your name? Jennifer. Why? We need your services. How many are you? Oh no, not three. Don't play hard to get. Hop in. No, no and no. Don't worry. Get in. Could be dangerous. Get in, you shit. Let go of me. Fucking faggot. You're fucked, bitch. Shut the fuck up! Take this, you queer shit! - Take this! - You son of a bitch! Let me go, you shit. You're fucked! One for my Mum, one for my Dad, and one for my granny. Stop it! You'll kill him! That's what it's about, getting rid of these fairies. I'm tired. It's like kicking a sack of potatoes. The fucking bastard bit me. You probably have Al DS now. - No way. Get me to the hospital. - Here. Coke cures everything. - Come on, Joaquin. - Let's go, man. - Come on, Joaquin. - Let's go. Once again, the city hits the streets in protest of last Friday's occurrences. University students joined neighborhood groups and labor unions. The representatives of the soup kitchens expressed their unease and announced... Oh, Joaquin! - What happened? - Carlos has been a pig. You don't know the things he said to me. What did he say? He got nasty when I told him we were friends and how I wanted him to be your friend too. We're a couple, right? We should share and do things. - I guess. - He insulted me and called me a slut, and asked me if I'd been in your apartment, giving you a blow job. He said he was going to tell everyone I'd sucked his dick. You sucked his dick for real? Well, once. I was drunk and... ...I don't know why I'm telling you this. Don't worry. He's your boyfriend, right? Our relationship's over, and it's all his fault. He's possessive and sexist. I've wasted 2 years with him. Be happy it's over. He's a pervert, a sex maniac. He used to tell me I was abnormal, frigid. And I'm not frigid, Joaquin. It's just that I'm not a lymphomaniac. Nymphomaniac. With an "n". Whatever, wise guy. Oh, Joaquin! I'm sorry, but I needed to see you. I'm delighted you came. Mind if I smoke some weed? Marijuana? No, no. I didn't know you were such a pot-head. That's why you're getting such poor grades. It distracts you. That's what they told us at school. You want some? I don't know. What does one feel? Try it. Okay, but only a drag. I don't want to become an addict. Don't exaggerate. A little weed won't make you an addict. It hurts my throat. Only the first time. Smoke more. I feel nothing, except sick. The truth is... I don't get it. Wait a bit. Don't move. You look great. When I was little, I wanted to be a dancer. I imagined myself on a stage with people applauding me. Dance. I'll dance, if you dance. What does pot make you feel? Good things. You still don't feel anything? I don't know. I feel like... I want you to touch me. Me too. You're beautiful. - I always liked you a lot. - And I, you. We shouldn't be doing this. I'm going to regret it tomorrow. No, Joaquin. We'd better not. We just met. You're going to think I'm a slut. God, I want you. It must be the drug. What's wrong? Are you okay? Joaquin... What's wrong? What's the matter, Joaquin? Nothing. I'll get over it. I'm sorry, I'll be okay. Don't be silly. We're friends, aren't we? Tell me. Are you saying you're sterile? You mean impotent. Sterile is something else. Whatever. You know what I mean. No, I'm not. It's just that when I'm with a woman... You don't like women? I like you a lot, Ale, but I also like guys. I want to make love to you, but... Poor thing, Joaquin. You must suffer a lot because of this. I don't want to be a fag. I'm sure you're not. You've got a trauma, that's all. But I'm going to help you. I'm going to turn you into a normal guy. I promise. Because you want to be normal, right? Is Joaquin in? I'm his mother. Oh, hello. Come in. - Hey, Mum. - Hello, honey. How are you? I was in the neighborhood. Brought you some money. Hope I'm not intruding. Alejandra's a friend. We're studying together. Alejandra? You're not Carmencita and Ernesto Cisneros' daughter? You know my parents? Known them all my life. You look just like your mother. I'm so happy you two are friends. So you're studying. We're taking a break. We've been at it all day, so Joaquin's cooking. It's our way of relaxing. Some wine? No thank you, dear. It goes to my head, although... okay, half a glass won't hurt. Don't get upset, son. You know how curious I am. Are you two just friends? Mum, please. Why don't you tell her? It's not a bad thing. We're going out. We've been together for 3 weeks. Why didn't you tell me, son? After all, I know her parents, and I know they raised her well. You went to Villa Mar?a, right? Don't be a bore. Don't interrogate her. You're the bore. She's your mother, it's normal. Don't worry, he's like that. But I'm very happy for you. You've got my blessing from now on. Cheers. Joaquin! My folks lent me their car. Want to go to the beach? Where did you two make love? Don't ask me that. I get embarassed. And it's history. Did you like it? Sometimes. What did you like? Come on, tell me. I liked it when he stroked my legs. Like this? Yeah. Did he touch you like this? What did you do? What did you say? He'd ask me to jerk him off and talk dirty to him. Jerk me off. Talk dirty to me. - What are we doing? - Don't you like it? Yes, but... I don't know, I don't think it's right. It's unhealthy. We're doing nothing wrong. I like touching you. And you like it too, right? Of course. Of course, I do. Don't rush things. Stroke me. I don't want to rush things, but look at me. Touch it. Weren't you sterile? I was pathetic, wasn't I? But you've done it, Joaquin. Isn't that great? All that jerking off, and now look, first time. You're a totally normal guy. It was all in your head. Yeah. I like you a lot, really. I love how you kiss. Let's travel, you and I, until we find ourselves alone, watching how the day ends in a minute. You and I, alone. You... Okay? Easy. - You want more? - No, I've still got some left. I'll be here. Close the door. It all happened so fast. - What? I can't believe it! Ale! - I'm nuts. Are you in love? Joaquin, look. This is Rocio. We studied together. I haven't seen you for years. Yeah, ages. Hey, if you want to dance, go. Don't worry about me. - Are you alone? - No, with Gonzalo, my boyfriend. But I lost him. There he is. He's cute, Gonzalo. You still as in love as before? More, I think. We've been together for 4 years. Finally. I was about to call the fire department. Oh Gonza, you're always exaggerating. Remember Alejandra? - Hi. - Of course. Joaquin, her boyfriend. - You know each other? - No. You're lucky. Got the prettiest girl in Lima. If I weren't with Rocio, I'd be with Alejandra. Maybe I'll steal her from you. Don't listen to him, that's Gonzalo, a real joker! He thinks he's a stud, but deep down, he's as loyal as puppy. Isn't that right, Gonza? Oh, Gonza. You're so gross! My car's all shook up... Let's dance, Gonza. Come on. - Do you have a car? - No. - We'll take you then. - God, it's late. My dad'll kill me. Take me first. Do you have a curfew too? Rocio's folks are a pain. Totally conservative. Home after 1:OO, and they make a scene. And you, Joaquin? Do you have a curfew? Bye. Rocio's very pretty. And really intelligent. Together for years. I adore her. You can tell. You're lucky to be in love. - Aren't you in love with Ale? - Don't know. I like her a lot, but sometimes I think I'm not. Hey, you want to have a drink? I've still got some coke. We can go to my apartment. We'll be alone there. God, this shit's good. What's bad is the day after. The hangover. - Do you worry the next day? - Sometimes. I think better when I'm loaded. I feel smarter. I get a bit stupid, and do things I regret later. - Like what? - Like... telling you I like you. I know it's crazy. I mean, you don't like me, but when I coke up I say what I feel. Listen, do you really like me? Yeah, I like you, but I know... The music's too loud, Gonza. It gives me a headache, and we can't talk. 4 years and you still don't like the same music as me. Nor the same films, nor soccer, nor car races, nor a lot of things. The perfect couple. The priest said it in the marriage chat. - You? At a marriage chat? - Yeah. You have to, if you want a church wedding. You didn't tell me, Roci. Cool! When's the date? In six months. To celebrate our 5 years together. And you two? When? Pay no attention to our sins, but our faith in your church, and according to your word, grant them peace and unity, you who live and rule world without end. Amen. Let us give each other the sign of peace. This is the happiest day of my life, son. - Congratulations. Ale's very pretty. - Thanks. Your Mum and our 25th anniversary... I did it for her. You know her. She got all excited about you coming. I'm here for her sake. Son... Your Mum and I would like you to come home to live or just visit, as you wish. After all... Time to dance, Luis Felipe, like we used to. Good God, woman. First the party, now this. Please me, I'm so happy. Okay, let's go. - You answering it? - No. Joaquin? Are you there? You must be in the shower. I'm running late. I'll be there in a half an hour. Bye. Shit. I forgot about the fucking project. Guess I've got to go then. Let's both go. I don't feel like seeing her. Let's go to my house. I'm free till noon, but Ale's going to give you hell. That's my problem. Thanks. - What are you doing? - Me? You stood me up. Why didn't you tell me you didn't want to study? I know you hate college, but what about me? I've been here for hours, like an idiot. I'm sorry. I should've called, but I didn't think you'd wait. We had a date, didn't we? I even phoned you. - Where have you been? - I'd rather not say. What happened? Does it have to do with us? You're not going to tell me? It's very complicated. It has nothing to do with you. It's something else, something I can't explain. But why? You've always told me everything. Why is it that you can't tell me now? Because I can't. Because... I don't want to hurt you. I really love you, Ale, a lot, but... But... I think we should break up. Break up? You want to call it quits? When did you realize this? Yesterday everything was fine. I met your parents. We've been doing everything together, like a couple, and the sex... It's good. You'd gotten over your trauma, you said so. Don't you remember? And stupid little me, I believed you. Are you in love with another girl? That's all I need. I cure you, a slut steps in... No, Alejandra, no. - I need to be alone, to think. - What about me? Haven't you thought about me? I'm in love with you. You're not. We've only been together for a few weeks. You'll get over it. It's for the best. Like you know? You're selfish. You think only of yourself. You could at least tell me why, what you don't like about me. It's not that. I love you like a friend. I'd like us to be friends. You're special to me, Ale. You're a pretty, fun and intelligent girl. You know what? Fuck you. Ale... Don't worry, kid. That woman's always going to love you. You know why? Because when a woman hates, she suffers. When she suffers, she loves. And when she loves, she makes love. Do you prefer women? It's different. It's got nothing to do with fucking a man. True. There's no comparison. With Ale everything's more delicate. It's just softer. With a woman, it's purer, more romantic. Like vegetarian food: Good, fine, but in the end, you want a big piece of meat. But with a man... - I've got a surprise for you. - I love surprises. I broke up with Ale. What's wrong? You should be happy. Why did you do that? I felt like shit, lying to her and sleeping with you. Did you tell Ale about us? We won't have to hide anymore. All you've got to do is tell Rocio. Are you crazy? I'd hurt her. It's never crossed her mind I've got a gay side. - So you're staying with her? - Of course. We're engaged. What did you expect? I thought you loved me. Joaquin, you're fucked up in the head. You want my advice? Go back to Alejandra, and keep it in the closet like me. That's survival in Lima. I'd feel like a jerk. Then why the hell were you with her? Because... I thought it could work, but it's you who I really like. What do you want? To hold hands in public like fairies? I want you to dump Rocio. No way, man. You're nuts. If you don't like the way things are, then forget me. May I speak to Rocio, please? Joaquin. Can she call me back. It's very urgent. - Aren't you coming in? - No. You scared me. Why that face? You're coming down, right? In the basement, with a major depression. Fuck, my brain's spinning, man. Don't think. Thinking's bad when you're down. I can't stop thinking. - Hi. - I'd like to talk. Can we? Sure, come in. Ale told me you had a fight. It's so sad. If there's anything I can do to help... anything, just tell me. - Thanks, but no. - Why? You made such a nice couple. Did Gonzalo say anything? What's up, Joaquin? What if Gonzalo cheated on you? Nonsense. Gonza would die before he did something like that. He's incredibly loyal. But if he did, what would you do? Would you leave him? It's like this, Rocio... Gonzalo's in love with me. What? It's the truth. Gonzalo's a two-timer. And he's in love with me. You're his cover-up. Thing is he's scared to admit he's a faggot. But we've been sleeping together since we met. I'm in love with Gonzalo too. I know how you feel, but I had to tell you. You going to break up? Get out! Get out of my house! I want you out! Pedro! Pedrito! A beer! Peeeedroooo! What are you looking at? Your pet. You like it? I think it's horrible. That's the idea. I use it to scare off the jerks. You don't need a fly to scare people off. I like aggressive men. Me too. What? Are you gay? No. Capricorn. Look, Capricorn, a present. - What are you doing? - Don't move. Oh, fuck! You hurt me. The first time always hurts. It looks lovely. Don't touch it. It could get infected. I think I need a line. You got any? How is it? Good. Then don't be stingy. Share it. - Want some? - What do you think? That I came to watch you, man? - I didn't ask you to. - Listen... I do what I want, Capricorn. Give. I don't have all night. Who do you think you are? You want some? Suck my dick first. - What? Begin. - Go to hell. I don't suck tiny pricks. Don't you like rough guys? What's that? - Suck it. - Ask your Mum to suck it, ass... Fuck! Fuck you, you fucking bastard! Hi. Who do you think you are? - What? - Don't play innocent. - I adore Rocio. We were going to marry. - It would've been a mis... Don't come near me, Gonzalo. You're trash, man. Faggots like you shouldn't exist. Honey? Are you okay? Crying? He's crying? It pains me to see him like that. The break-up with Ale's hit him hard. Another drink, Dad? Sure. That's fine. - That's it? - Don't drink so much. Let him be. If he needs to get drunk... Thanks, Dad. Mum was right. She said you were becoming a good person. Be careful with what you say, Luis. Don't you see you're encouraging him? He's turning into a drunk. Don't fight over me, don't fight. Let's make a toast, us three. You too, Mum. Just one glass. I know how much you love chilled white wine. What's wrong? Aren't you going to drink a toast to married life? To your son's return? Enough, Joaquin. Cut it out, okay? Cheers, but calm down. Learn how to drink. See? You said it. He can't drink. That's why he's drunk. It's gone to his head. Eat. You'll feel better. No. Thanks. Don't bother him. Leave him. He'll learn. He just broke up. It's normal. He'll get over it. Thanks, Dad. You understand me. Cheers. Cheers, Joaquin. I was young once too. Do you want some advice, man to man? I'm gay, Dad. I had to tell you someday. Please, son. Don't say those kinds of things. I don't like jokes like that. I'm serious, Mum. I like men. Nonsense, you're just drunk. Drunk and on coke. But no less of a fag. Ever since I could think, I've liked men. They... - Enough! - Please, don't fight. What? You going to hit me? I know how to defend myself. I may be a fag... You son of a bitch. Mum, he insulted us. What? Should I hit him? Enough, Joaquin, enough. What's wrong, son? You weren't like that before. You weren't. Let go of me. Let go of me. My son a faggot. Fucking shit... I'd rather have had a retarded one. You've got five minutes, people. If you're finished, you may hand your exams in and leave. - Any questions, Mr. Camino? - None. Of course not. Questions imply being aware of having to take a position, and... according to your notebook, you are neither aware nor do you have a position. Where are you going? I finished. You could say that. I'd say you haven't started. And you, Cordoba? What do you think? Another blank mind. My old man'll be pleased. He always said I was too stupid to study a career. And now I'll have to work in his factory and he'll control me. But you won't go hungry. I fought with my folks. Now they'll disown me. 3 years down the drain. Don't be an ass. Transfer from Lima to Concordia. I'm sick of college. My old man can give you a job. - I don't know, I've never worked. - Neither have I. We'd make a good team. Come on, Joaquin, cheer up. You know what? My folks are away. They're back on Tuesday. What do you say to celebrating our freedom? We can at least party till we drop for 4 days. How about it? Sure, why not. Let's go. College shitheads. Go fuck yourselves. When would you like to eat? You want to have lunch? I'd rather stay here. We've got to get in shape for tonight, man. I'm not hungry. That can be remedied. Make us a joint. I've got her trained. Makes them better than me. What if she tells your folks? You're crazy. Charito's in love with me. She'll do anything to please me. I could lend her to you for a night. She's black, but she does it better than most gringas I know. You're a fucking nut, Alfonso. Thanks, Charito. Care to go for a swim? The water's perfect. No, sir. Not now. You like my friend? He likes you. He told me. A lot. Stop playing. Bring us our lunch soon. Smoke. It'll wet your appetite. Charito's excellent, man. Want to try her? No, I wouldn't want to steal your woman. Is it true you like guys more? Who told you that? I heard people talk about it. I mean, I don't know. That's why I'm asking. Don't worry about it, man. I screw around too sometimes. No fucking way. I thought you hated gay guys. Only the Indian ones, cause they've got no class. Great, Alfonso. You scared the fuck out of me. You haven't answered. Do you or don't you? Sir, lunch is ready. Alfonso? What? Why are you laughing? No reason. I just can't believe I'm here with you. We look like a couple of queers. - We don't look. We are. - I'm not. This is just a passing vice for me. One day, no drugs, no guys. I'll get married, have a family, the works. Don't kid yourself. You won't. Maybe, you'll quit drugs, but guys... I doubt it. Look at what happened to me with Ale. I liked her, but I like guys better. Here, you can be a coke-head, a thief, a womanizer or whatever, but you can't be a faggot. I can't stop being a faggot. Then, you're fucked. What I've got to do is get out of here, leave. This city's driving me crazy. I wasn't like this before. You want to escape this shithole this weekend? Sure they won't notice? Fuck no. He doesn't know I know the combination. And what? He'd call the cops? Holy shit! What's wrong? I've never seen so much coke in my life. There must be 10,000 big ones easily. Leave it. I think your dad's a drug dealer. A major cokehead's what he is. He and his friends can snort half a bag like this just sitting on the beach. Here, sniff. It's great. Unbelievable. This we sell and this is for our personal use. We'll easily get $5,000 for this. It's more than enough to go to Cancun for the weekend. - God, I hate this city. - It might be a shithole, but it's our shit, man. We're kings here. The kings of shit. Why did they pick Hiroshima and not Lima? Don't complain, man. Anywhere else, we'd be assholes. But here... There he is. What if he pays us in fake notes? He looks like a bum. He's a dealer. Who were you expecting? Al Pacino? 3,000. Count the bills, please. I like to keep my books straight. If there's more, let me know. My powder's the best. My clients, first-rate. It's all here. For you. If you ever want to do business, count on me. We did it. Tomorrow, Cancun. We'll be kings at the beach. The tourists will kill to meet us. Stop dreaming! - No one's going to notice us. - No? You'll see. When I'm on coke, I can do anything. Everything becomes small, like toys. I become God, Superman. So use your supernose. No more. I'm loaded. And my brain's fried. Like instead of ideas, I've got oil. Tons of oil drops that can't stop talking to each other. All at once. - Screaming... - Shut up. You're talking shit. Better listen to it. You know what coke's going to do to us? Turn us into broke loners, who steal wallets and beg drugs at bars. Shut up. You're full of shit man. You're going to own your own law firm, the most important in Lima. I'm going to have a fish factory, a construction firm, a lovely wife, my... Hey, why'd you stop? I don't feel good. My chest hurts. Join the club. Knew you had a heart somewhere. I can't move, man. But if you can breathe, this'll help. - No. Really. Don't. - Here, take your medicine. You see? You said it. Coke cures everything. It makes you strong like rock, indestructible like Superman, a cheat like Gonzalo, a beast like my dad... More? Hey... Are you okay? Alfonso. Wake up, for fuck's sake! Alfonso, wake up, damnit. Don't do this to me, please. Fuck. You crazy asshole. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy king... Yes, hello. I'd like to make a reservation for Miami. For today. Camino. Yes, Joaquin Camino. - You're still here? - What time is it? I fell asleep. Apart from walking dogs, all you know how to do is sleep. It's my favorite pastime. You promised. Call Hans. - I hate Hans. - You don't know him. He makes me sick. You sound like a princess. Be practical. What do you need right now? A prince? No. Money. Right? So you can get out of... Miami and not walk dogs and not look for Hans. We've been roommates for a year. You, with more money. I came here with nothing. Look at me, if I keep at it, I'll own a store in 6 months and live with Cris. Good for you. I envy your glamorous future. And you? You plan on walking dogs forever? I hope not. Who was it? Hans. He talks like a hairdresser. And he's got 4 kids. When his wife goes away, he changes. Sometimes into a woman. Once, he received me dressed like a Chinese lady. I hate those faggots. It's a job. You do it and that's that. If Hans were like you, I'd do it for free. Don't wrinkle my clothes. With women, for free. You. No way. We're friends. You'll see. Let me go, you shit! Stop complaining, little girl! I knew I'd find you here. - What about your customer? - Last minute stuff. He's late. The jerk. If I'd known, I'd have gone with Hans. How'd it go? Bad. - Why? - I couldn't do it. I tried but I couldn't. I lost you a customer. No. I'll call tomorrow and make another date. But in this business... I'm not going into this business. I can't. Okay. Your problem. Here. It'll help you forget. - Let's go for drink. - Give me another. It's what I miss most about Lima: Good, cheap coke. All these pretty people, and I've got to go. And that guy's not showing up, and the $300 includes my waiting. Fucking hell. Check out that beauty. You know female beauty doesn't do it for me. Fuck, she's turned around. Nice ass on her, too. The one in the green skirt. Damn, she can move! What's wrong, man? She's Peruvian. Jesus! Can you tell just by looking at her ass? Yes, I can. We were boyfriend and girlfriend. Tell me it's not Ale. It is. Say hi to her. Go talk to her. Want some coke? It helps. No thanks. I don't want any. You know what your problem is? You've no balls! You're a loser. - Could be. I don't care. - I can't believe it. Look at her. You still in love with her? It seems like ages. The asshole's here. Here's some cash to treat your ex. Hi. Joaquin! You nut! It's incredible! I was just thinking about you. You look great. Thanks. You too. I can't believe it, Joaquin! You want to dance? I love this song. Remember? How could I forget? Joaquin... I think I'm going to throw up. How gross. Do you feel better? Yeah, thanks. How embarassing. You'll think I'm a drunk. No. It happens to everyone. I don't get it. I only had 2 margaritas. Miguel poisoned me. The guy dancing with you? - Is he your boyfriend? - Are you crazy? He was my Urban Anthropology professor. I bumped into him and... You don't have to explain. - You want some coffee? - No. I'm fine. Thanks. Let's walk. It's a nice night. Never trust the weather here. It's treacherous. You're so negative. Look, you can even see the stars. Alright, that's enough. I hate being told I was wrong. We need to wash your vomit away. Gross. How long will it rain like this? All night, one hour, two minutes. Who knows. Why? Got to look for your prof? No, fuck him. I'm going to Boston early tomorrow. Rocio's there. I love storms. They're like horror films. Rocio's in Boston? And Gonzalo? In Lima. I see him sometimes, but it's not the same. Alfonso got married. - Alfonso Cordoba? - Yeah. He had a near fatal accident. But it did him good. He quit drugs. Works for his dad, married. Now, he's an executive. Crazy motherfucker. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm glad Alfonso's doing well. An executive. Can't imagine it! What a shame. The show's over. What should we do now? Dogs? You take care of dogs? And kids before that. I prefer dogs. They're a pain, but they don't scream. Why are you staring at me? I don't mean to pry, Joaquin, but you, walking dogs? Get real. Life's not so easy here. It's just that Lima was hell for me, Ale. Cause you broke up with me. It's a joke. Don't give me that face. I was a bastard, wasn't I? It's over, Joaquin. Forget it. It was my fault. You were nice. I wasn't. I was half-crazy. You know what I thought? That you loved Gonzalo. Can you believe it? I think I'll be sad when I get back to Lima. I'll miss you. I'm an idiot, right? I'm the only idiot around here. What did you like about me? I liked the way you kissed. It was weird. Weird? News to me. - Really? No one's told you that? - No. When you kiss... I mean, when you used to kiss me, I don't know what you did with your lips, but it was great. Maybe now it wouldn't be. Maybe it would. Want to try it? Do you? I like it better than before. Come back to Lima, Joaquin. You could take up school again. Look, my parents have a cool apartment that's empty. Looks out at the sea. It's pretty. You could live there, take classes. Easy ones, where you don't need to... Listen, stop it. You're going too fast. - Have I upset you? - No. You're right. Who am I to say anything. - Let's go. It's late. - No. Maybe you're right. But it's a tough one. I'm confused. You're still confused? I think you're going to be confused forever. You really don't know what to do? Sure. Sure, I do. Let's do it here, by the sea. You and those of you who have studied here form part of a saga, that, like a blanket from Paracas, carries the knowledge, the truth and the ethics that went into its well-weaved yarn. One mistake, one dishonest act, one error is enough to destroy the age-old, intricately, detailed work of this University. You, as recent law graduates of La Concordia, have a responsibility... I attest that all our law graduates exemplify honesty... Now, to hand out the diplomas in the name of our nation. Pleased, gentlemen? There are many pretty girls, so behave. Pardon me. Pardon me, excuse me. Joaquin! I want to make a toast alone with you. This is French champagne I've been saving up. Thanks. Cheers. - Are you happy, son? - I think so. Me too. I know you've worked hard for this. You know, I'm very proud to be your dad. Really. The Cordobas are here. They want to say hello. Go on. Have fun. Congratulations, man. - It's been a long time. - Way too long. - Hi. - Hi. - I didn't think you'd come. - I had a meeting. - How was graduation? - A drag. Don't believe him. It was great. God, you're big. 8 months, right? I can't wait to have it. It must be uncomfortable. No, not at all. But I'm tired and hungry all the time. Take advantage and binge now. Once it's born, you're on a diet and in the gym. I saw the snacks. Appetizing. Come on, Ines. I'll go with you. The canap?s are delicious. My woman's about to explode. Is it a boy or a girl? Girl. I'm ecstatic. Girls are less trouble than boys. Just ask your old man or mine. - He must be thrilled. A grandfather. - He's delighted. See? I was right. You ended up settling down. I'm scared shitless, Alfonso. I'm not like you. Sorry, man. Hello. Yes? What's wrong? We'll need a pro forma for tomorrow. What did you say? I can't hear you. What? Hey, Joaquin. Congratulations. You're a lawyer now. For hopeless cases, surely. What? Aren't you glad to see me? Of course, I am, but it's been so long since I've heard from you... If the mountain doesn't... How does that go? Skip it... Hey, Ale. Hi. What are you doing here? Did you invite him? Well, the truth is I crashed. And the guard's going to kick me out, if the host doesn't say we're friends. Your Mum wants you to say hi to your aunt. They're waiting. So you go tell the guard. Yeah, and ask him for my I.D., I left it there. What a bore. You don't look very happy to see me. No, it's not that. It's... I wasn't expecting you. Are you here alone? All alone. Free as the wind. Joaquin, come. Aunt Josefina wants a hug. God, how my baby's grown! Cheers! - Darling. - Cheers, Aunt. I knew you'd come. Here's your I.D. Thanks. You haven't married. No. I'm better off single, not answering to anyone. One night stands here and there. It's cool. And you? I hear you're marrying Alejandra. Don't know if I will. For now, I just want to open an office. - Maybe we could meet one day. - No problem for me. You had the problems, remember? I'm still the same, whether you marry or not, whether I marry or not. What about you? The same or have you changed? Joaquin? Joaquin, are you there? Yeah, we're here. What's up? Potheads. I knew you'd be here. Joaquin, the photographer's ready. Come on. Everyone's waiting. Come with us. Don't you like photos? I go where I'm told. But put out the joint. Are we ready? Luis Felipe! Come! Hurry! Patience. I'm coming. Let's go. Pose for posterity. Smile, please.
