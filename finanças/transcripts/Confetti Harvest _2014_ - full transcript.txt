CONFETTI HARVEST What's this now? Did you arrange this? Who are they? No more room in the campgrounds and there's a sick boy with them. -He doesn't exactly look sick. -He did up close. Did you talk to these people dressed like that? We'll never get rid of them. -What are they doing? -Got water. -Why didn't you call us? -I didn't want to disturb the afternoon nap. -I was awake anyway, so I thought... -Didn't you realize... ...we're not free with strangers in our yard. -They'll have to use the toilet. -Ah, well. Problem solved. -Let's send them away. -Well, that's a bit harsh. ...who'd recognize their best works as glaring sins? Who have forfeited everything? Who take the Lord for their refreshment? There are still seats. Are there still those who are far from the Lord? Are any among you called? Are there those among you who welcome death? Because only after death true life awaits us. Believe that the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ... ...has been spilled to atone for our sins. We've strayed from the path to salvation... ...because we lack the strength to choose the narrow road. We don't have enough strength to remain on the narrow road... ...until death... ...when true life awaits us... ...beside Him who we love above everything. That we die to be able to be reborn. Raise your heart to the Lord. -Katelijne. -Hello, sir. -I can't win with this skirt. -Sure you can. Amen. So what were the points, guys? Well? The three points of God's sacred law. The law curse the sinner. The law damn the sinner. And... The law kill the sinner. -The tractor's fuel is almost gone again. -Yes, it's a guzzler. -I'll top it up tomorrow. -I'll do it. -Let Rogier do it. -Rogier? Dad, he was riding around like a maniac yesterday. So what did you see me do? -Zigzagging like a drunk. -Nonsense. Hey, hey. -You're lucky that barn's still there. -Do you learn that arguing in church? -Name one thing you saw me do. -That's enough. my help comes only from the Lord Who heaven, sea and earth created and preserved ever since When I have money, I'm going to Canada. Apparently, farms are much bigger over there. Canada! Katelijne! Katelijne. Stubborn as a mule. Did you use this one down there? That's my washcloth. Luckily, I'm clean both down and up. Yuck. Satan, the killer of humans from the beginning of time... ...will do his utmost to pull you off the straight and narrow. Keep in mind, children, at your new schools... ...you'll be exposed to his temptations. Yes? -Satan wants us to read different books. -Yes. -About us descending from apes. -Right. -And fairy tales. -Exactly. Fairy tales are expressions of pagan stories. Satan always looks for something that's dear to your heart. Don't be too quick to think that music has no hold on you. There's something in music that tempts you. And now... Satanic texts. They discovered in America that the subconscious... ...can decipher Satanic texts. I will rise I'm your sire Satan There are also a lot of songs about sex, but I don't have an example of that right now. God's word stands firm throughout eternity it will not budge an inch Satan... Look, this is a cow. When the cow eats a dandelion it will first go down into the rumen. Then into the reticulum, followed by the omasum. And lastly into the abomasum. It's over here. And over there. When the cow poops, the dandelion is still yellow. Go and have a look when dad turns on the mixers. They float all the way to the top. Kat... Ro, I'm warning you. A child doesn't belong in a café. Straight back home after shopping. It's not for us. Come on. I was wearing my coveralls and my cap when I tripped on a ham. A ham this big. I thought: I'll carry it inside. Look at all that ice-cream. Eat it before it melts. And the coffee. -With everything. I'm not a cheap date. I cut a piece off that ham, tasted it and I grimaced. Sea salt. Then I knew it had been a pig with erysipeloid. They hope that by cooking it in seawater you wouldn't find out about it. Later on I heard that the reverend had gotten a piece first. I assume that if it hadn't ended well for him salvation would still await him. -Grandpa? -Yes? Is that story about the ham true? Grandma thought the Lord had sent it. Who knows? You're filthy. It's over. The fumes. What mischief did you get up to? He was looking for dandelions. What were you thinking? You know how dangerous that manure pit is. What will become of our body? It returns to dust and the worms will eat it. Who shall be called rich? Those who have stored up a treasure in heaven. Who want to leave the world? Those who are heirs to the Lord. Who are the happiest people? Those who desire no greater happiness than doing the will of God. Who are the unhappiest? Those who follow their own will. What will be their end? Eternal damnation. What will be the end of the pious? Eternal salvation and glory. Amen. It's the tough, narrow road which leads to the Lord. The broad road is more pleasant and easier. Which is why many of us take that road. Unfortunately, I add. And from his throne, the Lord will address them. And to them he says: I never knew you. "Away from me." Mur thoughts are with the wife and family of Mr. Minderhoud. That's what happens... when you find your business more important than your salvation. No sign or anything that he ended up well? No one has seen or noticed anything. Small is the gate and narrow the road to life and only a few find it. -Are you ever troubled by your sins? -Mh, that child. She doesn't want to hear it, but even green leaves fall sometimes... ...and then it's too late. BIBLE -Tea, child? -Yes, please. Those who want to get wet should walk in the rain. Those who want to be saved... Oh, child... Suppose you were to experience that too? Attaining salvation? Wouldn't that be a miracle? I used to be just like you: living from one day to the next. If your grandpa had just tried harder, he might have ended up well. Shall we read? Guys, enough dilly-dallying. Get to work. The cows won't wait. She's from the farm where he was an intern. She's from the seceders. They're more strict than us. Jannemieke sleeps in your bed this weekend. Otherwise she'll have to cross the water to Terneuzen tonight. Jannemieke? Katelijne can give you a tour once you've tidied up. She can serve as an example to you. -Jannemieke? With her you can tell she's different. We have to be strangers on earth. People have to be able to tell by your actions... ...your face, your words and by the way you dress. I'll do it. -Have you really never had a haircut? -No, we're not allowed. Ouch! -Ouch. -Sorry. Now you've got the sister you always wanted. Sleep well. Again? Maybe you'll go to my school. In the laundromat? I attend school every Monday, you know. Don't forget: Blessed are the ignorant. You can read as much as you want, but if you don't learn the most important thing... ...you are only a clanging cymbal. Mom? Do you think I really have to go to Jannemieke's school? We'll see. You can't count on the weather forecast for one bit. Guys, just one more minute and we'll read the Bible. Katelijne was looking. I wouldn't let Rogier slobber all over me. Come on, lazybones. Don't make me come up again. You? Jeroen's. Empty again? I might come even more often next year. -Having another one? -Yes. The doctor was against it, because she always needs a caesarean. But, ah well... I've been a naughty boy. -The ninth is it? -No, the tenth. They might as well put in a zipper. See you. I'll give the place a good cleaning. It's usually just half done, I think. Katelijne, can you go and see whether the sheep still have enough water? Yes. No! -You have to help me. -Rogier, Christiaan... ...get down here! Yeah... ...a tidy counter and a clean toilet... ...are the signs of a good housewife. Yes... that's what I mean. At least you understood. The water was very black after scrubbing. I refreshed the water three times and each time it was very black again. She's quite capable. Guys, just cut off the black part. It gives you cancer. Hi. -I heard that the teacher has a TV as well. -Not true. Hidden in a cupboard. When the elders visit, he quickly locks the door. Not. -I can smell you were with the cows. -Not. A letter from the teacher. It smells in here. Christiaan? A sick cow needs a shot. I can't leave now, but it's at the veterinarian's. -Fine, I'll go. -Can I come? -To Canada? -If you don't have anything else to do. We can go for an ice-cream. I don't want one. But it's so hot. lt's a cut above, ladies and gentlemen. lt's Sensational Enterprise. Step right up. -Minderhoud, going out with your girlfriend? -It's my sister. -What are you doing here? -Driving shit. Satisfied? I can smell it. No time to wash? Watch your mouth, OK? -Feel like having a drink? -No, we're going for ice-cream. Here, have a sip. Look, there's Levine Fagmachine. Chasing small kids again. -Want a sip? -Is there alcohol in it? Only a tiny amount of beer was in it, but that's gone. -You? -Throw it in the bin. Why the rush? Let's just walk around for a bit. This is really awesome. You really have to experience it once. You've been found out. Kee Dominisse saw you getting out of one of those revolving things with flashing lights. She said you looked as sick as a dog. -What else have you been up to? -Nothing. I raised you properly, so don't act as if you didn't learn anything. No. I'll ask your father to give you a good spanking. Maybe that will teach you. Don't look so impudent. Just my luck to have one like you. Say: parallelepiped. Palle... Pallallepiped. And: industrial wastewater treatment center. You moved your head back. -You're just pushing it in deeper. -No, I'm not. It's the only thing I can do. Cindy has slender fingers. Not sausages like yours. Lady hands that are only fit to pick up cutlery. I bet she's never earthed up a potato. You can never have a normal conversation. Come here with your face. There's a huge blackhead on your nose. Petra and Eline always lie on their back like this too, you know. When their parents go to the city on Thursdays... ...they lie naked on the yellow bedspread in their parents' bedroom... ...to try to get a suntan, because they think they're too pale. Didn't you ever notice they look a bit yellowish on Fridays? Never paid attention to it. -I'll take a look tomorrow. -You should. Once... ...when they were home alone, a man drove up the driveway. He got out. He was a drug addict. Honestly. He looked in every window. Petra and Eveline were in their parents' bedroom, of course. -You smell weird, by the way. -Then what happened? Then... Then they could only come up with one thing. That guy took off like a bat out of hell. When their parents came home, they were still barking. I was thinking... When you go to Canada, I'll come with you. -Were they still naked? -When? When their parents returned. I guess. I'm not exactly sure. They must have been. They must have thought he was still there and didn't dare move. Were they on their backs or on their stomachs? How should I know? I wasn't there, was I? I'm going to the village. -Demolished it again, moron. -You are the moron here. That's the last time I lent you something. -Ask if you can ride his Zündapp. -No chance. -What if I ask him? -What business is it of yours? Coming, guys? Christiaan's acting stupid. Cindy? Cindy, come on. And then Gerrit came with his crippled leg and everyone stood up. Ready? Are you? -Make sure you behave. -I will. You look like your mom, you know. She had the same radiant smile when she was young. When your dad saw her for the first time we were sitting in the garden. Your mom in her short blue dress. She was radiant, the way you are now. -My mom? -Yes. That's when she met your dad. Really. -Aunt? -Yes? They're not allowed to wear pants. Oh? Why not? They're men's clothes. A woman in men's clothes is an abomination to the Lord. Pink pants are men's clothes? A little bit. Gloria, look, my cousin. Are these fairy tales? Yes, very famous ones. Pagan stories. The witch with the potato face... ...said the girl had to remove all the lentils from the ashes... ...or she couldn't go to the ball. Fortunately, the pigeons helped her and she was done on time. Actually, pigeons can't help. Don't believe that. But you can for now. A ball doesn't suit our lifestyle and neither does showing off. Everyone to her own bed now. Sleep well. Look... Well, well. Very nice. Did you find that book? Oh, lamb. Did you hurt yourself? Wonderful. You look like me when I was young. Wait, I'll style your hair. Open your eyes. Darling, you're a beauty. Take it from me. Have a look. No, I've never had a short blue dress. She's mistaken. Huh? Who can that be? They'll probably be here all night. Christiaan? You go and play outside. You can't be here. That's dangerous, stupid asshole. Guys? Guys, Christiaan's getting married. Come on. Everyone to bed. Amen. I'll start with the announcements. First: Next week there will be a collection for the building fund. Second: Christiaan Minderhoud and Pieternella Cornelia Davidse... ...made a confession of guilt to the church council last week... ...for breaking the Seventh Commandment. We'll continue the service by singing Psalm 51 verse 1 and 4. Behold my remorse. Hear how a penitent pleads. And cleanse me from all my dirty sins. have mercy on me, O God according to your unfailing love according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight Hello. Are you by yourself? Yes. And you? Are those your parents? Yes. We live nearby. Where do you live? -The Hague. Aren't you married? Not anymore. If no one's waiting for you anyway... ...would you consider... -What would I consider? -Well... ...me moving in with you. Do you really want to? -Really? -Really. And in bed? How are you in bed? What? Can you spread your legs really wide? Or are you too small for that? Why were you talking to that man? Do you know him? Do you talk to strangers now? Brazen hussy. She's not one of ours. Come on, let's go. -Zip it up, we're leaving. -Hurry! -Zip it up, we're leaving. -Shut your ugly face. I didn't get this voice for nothing. The reverend says we have to use our talents. See? It worked. Luckily, I'm more faithful to God than to people. We'll have to come up with something else soon. But Christaan's found a job with a harvest company, so we can afford it. -Do you like living in the village now? -Terribly. Really? -What do you want? -Want some lemonade? I should go, actually. It prickles. Her report card wasn't as good as last year's. That could be right. I have to admit that I was stingy in handing out A's. An A+ may make you think you're perfect. Kids these days think they're quite something. They compare grades and thumb their nose at each other. As long as such a school doesn't alienate her from us. Or from God. Let's take it step by step. This report card allows her to take advanced high school in Goes. Hey, stop making a racket. It should be possible here. First remove that tractor. -Was my teacher here last night? -He just wouldn't leave. He was still here at 1 1 :30. -What did he want? -Can't you see we're busy, Katelijne? Yes! -Did my teacher say anything yesterday? -He just wouldn't leave. But no wonder. There's no one waiting for him at home. Was that necessary? Your garden is beautiful. It is. I didn't think it would be, after the spring we had. I wouldn't mind opening up my garden to other garden devotees. That's a great idea, mom. That garden is your idol. Why don't you grow cabbage or peas. The Lord has to wax and I have to wane. That's the way it is. All that reading. It will make you as simple as a goat. Clean some chairs for the party. OK, go ahead. I went with Petra again yesterday, so she could try on the dress. But Petra says I'm not allowed to tell. That material is so soft. -Does it have hoops? -I'm not allowed to tell. -I'm just allowed to say it's stunning. -Which color? Man, my arm hurts. What do you think? It's a shame grandpa isn't here for this. When I think about it, Katelijne, I think: I wonder how he's doing. I wonder where he is. I don't dare to think about him ending up so badly. And you can't really say that he had a wicked character. Right? He was always glad to help others. But that's human reasoning. That's... I think that grandpa is better off than you think. Remember when I went to the city with grandpa? Something strange happened on the way home. You're familiar with the crossroads at the flower meadow. There was an old woman there. At that exact moment, grandpa heard singing. I heard nothing. Grandpa slowed down to be able to hear it better. I still heard nothing. If grandpa hadn't slowed down, we'd both be dead. Ro never told me. But then he never told me anything. It reminded me right away of that psalm. "The Lord will rescue his servants." "The righteous person may have many troubles." "But the Lord delivers him from them all." Yes, that one. Grandpa said that that was the psalm he'd heard at the crossroads. I didn't really talk to grandpa after that. And at the funeral, I heard that psalm again. I didn't really dare to talk to anyone about it. So here you are! Have you lost your mind completely? Do you know how much still has to be done. Thank you for the cookie. I thank you too, child. Christiaan? Christiaan! Chris! Christiaan! Chris! Here! In a marriage it's the husband's duty... ...as head of the wife... ...to teach her. And in addition he has to comfort... ...and protect her. Thou woman... ...will obey your lawful husband in all things. Because is it not true that Adam was created first? And after that Eve as Adam's handmaiden. Like Sarah... ...who obeyed her husband Abraham. Naming him 'her Lord'. as the hart panteth after the water brooks... my soul thirsteth for God living God, O when shall I come and appear before God?
