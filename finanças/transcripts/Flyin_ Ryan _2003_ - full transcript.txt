(lighthearted violin music) - Mom are you sure we're going the right way? There isn't anything but trees out here. - Well that's a good thing about moving out of the city. - And what's the bad thing? - Nothing. Life is going to be great from now on. (horse neighing) - [Ryan] I don't believe this. We're heading into no mans land. (suspenseful music) - I'm sure in the day it looks much-- - Much worse. - Well it's big. Come on. (suspenseful music intensifies) (owl hooting) (wolf howling) It's nothing. (creaking) (knocking on door) Rita. (knocking on door) Rita! - Maybe she's dead. - Ryan! (weed wacker whirling) (Ryan screams) - Well. Will you look who the owl dropped off. Ryan Maguire, well I'm your blood boy and my house is your house. - Rita we're so grateful I-- - Oh hush Annie. Oh will you look at the red hair on you boy. Just exactly like your father's. - Did my dad ever come up here? - Oh every summer when he was young. Well come on. This house was built 100 years ago by your great grandfather Theodore Magoogan Maguire. He built it with his own two hands and he never wanted to leave this place. Yup, old Theo lived here and old Theo died right here. (foot stomps) - Right here? - I think Aunt Rita's speaking figuratively. Aren't you? - Whatever you say. (spooky music) This room's yours Annie. - [Annie] Oh it's-- - It's small but functional. And Ryan this one's yours. - Sweet. - Sweet. Enough said. I need to go finish clearing the back field. - Isn't it awfully late to be gardening? - That's the way I always do with my chores. Well it's much cooler at night. I'll see you in the morning for breakfast, 8 a.m. sharp. - Hey it's late you can unpack in the morning. Time for sleep. I need to make a good impression on my first day at work. Okay good night. (creaking) (ominous music) (creaking) (Ryan screams) Ryan! - Uh, I'm fine. - Ah, unpack tomorrow please, lights off. (creaking) (spooky sounds) (ducks quacking) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Ryan, Annie. Breakfast. - Something smells really good. - Well you sit yourself down then. - Come on Ryan we're running late. Oh Rita I'm sorry you went through all this trouble. I promised the hospital I'd come in early and fill out employment forms. - You're taking the boy away without breakfast? - I'll get him something in town. - Well I will let it go today but from now on the one meal we will share everyday is breakfast and that is essential. - Sorry again about breakfast. - Yeah me too. - Yeah, huh. (cat meows) Huh. (swing creaking) (snoring) - [Annie] Ryan I'll meet you right here at 5:30. Have fun. - I can walk back to Aunt Rita's it's not that far. - But Ryan. (door slams) Ry! Ryan! Ryan are you sure you're not gonna get lost? - Mom! (people chattering) (edgy rock music) - Hey, who's the kid over there? Anybody know him? - [Group] No. - Let's go check him out. (edgy rock music) - Hey! - Hey. - You live around here? - Yeah. - Yeah, well where? - Up Old Ranch Road. - Where up Old Ranch Road? - At the Maguire house. - You live in that crazy Rita's place? - It's haunted up there. - And she's loony. - [Ryan] She's okay. Hey want to kick around a soccer ball? - You call this a soccer ball? I'd rather kick around you. (laughing) - Hey guys. - What? What ya gonna say carrot head. - My name's Ryan. - I'll call you whatever I want to call you jerk head. - Dork. - [Boy] Moron. - Come on guys, let's get him! (tense music) (dog barking) (dog growling) Coward! - Loser! Close in guys! (dog barking and growling) (tense music intensifies) You're history! (splashes) (laughing) (dog whining) - Dirk Cooper! What are you doing? I said what are you doing? - Nothing dad. - Yeah well do your nothing away from my favorite fishing spot. Bass don't like noise. And if the bass aren't biting I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy you'll be miserable, capisce? - Yeah. - Now get outta here. (splashing) (splashing and coughing) - Do you need help? I'll be right back. Take one end and I'll pull you out. Okay here goes. (splashes) (geese honking) (calm music) - Eight brothers and sisters. Nicki how can you remember all of their names? - That's easy. I memorized all the capitals in the entire world last year. Just ask me. - Okay, what's the capital of Russia? - Give me a break. My dog Mugsy would know that one. It's Moscow. Ask me something harder. - Do you know baseball stats? - Yeah but my brother Michael and my sister Caroline are better than me in that category. - How old are they? - Nine, they're twins. - Identical? - I don't think so silly. Caroline and Michael. - I guess my brain got a little waterlogged back in the lake. - You might want to have your dad teach you how to swim. - My dad died when I was three. - Oh I'm sorry. - Yeah. - So, this is where I live. It's kind of small for such a big family. I'm not rich like Dirk Cooper. - Neither am I. - But hey, I could teach you how to swim if you like? - For real? - As sure as Minsk is capital of Belarus. - Is Belarus a country? - Just south of Latvia. - [Ryan] See ya. - Ryan! Ryan you've ruined your clothes. Oh you know I can't afford to buy you new ones. - It's just mud and weeds from the lake. - The lake? You went in the lake? But you don't even know how to swim. - It was shallow. - You know I don't think leaving you downtown was such a good idea. - Mom I'm fine. - When I'm away your Aunt Rita's in charge. Maybe you should just stay here with her-- - I'm not a baby. And besides I wasn't alone. - Did you meet some kids your age? - I'm gonna take this box upstairs. - So who are these new kids you met? - This girl, Nicki. And she's like a walking encyclopedia but not in a geeky way. And she has this funny big dog named Mugsy. Mom can we get a dog now? You said the only reason we couldn't get one before is because we lived in an apartment. - Ryan we can't ask Aunt Rita to have a dog. She's been kind enough to let us stay here. (creaking) - Maybe she wants a dog. - If she wanted a dog she'd already have a dog. - Do you think this place is haunted? The guys in town say there's ghosts here. - Oh no, old houses just make creepy noises. (bangs) (Annie screams) Just an old ironing board. Must be a bad hinge huh? Things seem scarier at night. (intense music) (both scream) - I thought I'd find you upstairs. Just wanted to remind you about breakfast tomorrow morning. - Right. - Good. (intense music) (gasps) And be on time. (birds chirping) (bees buzzing) (upbeat music) (whistles) Breakfast! - I'm so hungry. - What a day this is going to be. I got asked to assist Dr. Warzecka in surgery this afternoon. - I'm glad somebody around here likes doctors. You ask me, you go into a hospital, you don't get any better, you just come out worse. Oh not there young man. - Uh, where should I sit? - Right over there. That's your seat. That was Theodore Magoogan Maguire's chair. - Aunt Rita, there's some... - It's for you Ryan. It's a found treasure, a present. - I don't know, I mean. - What he's trying to say is thank you. Those shoes seem to be just his size. - Oh I forgot something. - Mom these shoes are gross. They're all muddy and they have holes in the bottom. - I know but it's the thought that counts. Plus I want you to be gracious. Go ahead. - Aunt Ri. I just wanted to say thanks for these shoes with holes in the bottom. - These reflectors boy, I got these off of one of your father's old model airplanes. - My dad's? - Yes. Your great grandfather Theodore Magoogan Maguire gave him model airplanes to build. Well Theo himself was an amateur pilot. One of Lake Port's own Wright brothers. And old Theo well, he wants you to have these. (upbeat guitar music) (gentle music) (swing creaking) (snoring) (knocking on door) - Coming. Nicki, come in. - Hey Ryan. This is quite a house. - Yeah. It's just a little creepy at night that's all. - What do you mean? - You'd have to be here. - Hey. When did you get Heelys? - What are you talking about? - These? When did you get these? - My aunt gave them to me. Why what are they? - [Nicki] All you need is wheels and then you can heel all around. - Do you have any wheels? - Nope but I know just the place to get some. It's across the lake. - Do we have to swim? - Ryan the lake is huge. We'll take a peddle boat. (geese honking) (seagulls cawing) Are you having fun yet? - It sure is a big lake. - It's the biggest natural lake in all of California. - Is that for real? - Yup. The Pomo Indians hunted, canoed, and fished right here on Clear Lake over 3,000 years ago. And their boats were made out of tule reeds. - Tule boobs? (laughing) - Tule reeds silly. Like those green ones over there. - Whoa! That was huge. - The jumpers are bass. Some people come fish here for tournaments. - Dirk's father fishes for bass. - Yup, that's why some people call him a basshole. Get it? (laughing) Basshole. (gentle music) The shop isn't too far from here. - [Ryan] I wonder who owned these shoes. - [Nicki] Yeah and why they gave them up. - [Ryan] And how my aunt got them. (turkeys gobbling) - [Nicki] This is old town. - [Ryan] It's more like a ghost town. - [Boy] It's very hot out here. - [Boy] Yup. - After the gold rush was over most people moved out. Only a few families stayed. - Gold? - Over behind that mountain. Mount Konocti. There's an old gold mine with a huge gold pit and everything. - [Ryan] Sounds kind of creepy. - It's a magical, mystical world. (spooky music) It's like being in another century isn't it? - More like another world. - Howdy partners. (laughs) I see you found the rock of knowledge. A very fine choice. It's actually a late diamond. An old volcanic rock. And what captivates your attention? - I was looking for some wheels for these. - Special shoes, yes. It takes someone with a keen sense to see the value in something not so shiny. - Well they are pretty dirty and used but if they had new wheels. - Nothing new around this place. Not even me. - Well sorry for wasting your time. Nicki let's go. - But! If you wanted old wheels maybe I can help you. - Maguire, that's my name. - Well now, T.M. Maguire. He was a legend around here. Some said he was crazy. - That would figure. - The history of all of our ancestors can be felt if you just let yourself imagine. Not all eyes can see the magic. Not all hearts can accept the gifts. Can you? - I could try. - Now look here at this model airplane. Well I'll be, it has exactly what you need. Wheels. - Come on go for it. (edgy rock music) - Hey Dirk. Dirk look. - Oh man! I don't believe it. That Maguire punk doesn't even have a skateboard. - Man. - Come on. Somebody's got some wheels. - They're okay. - You think so? - Yeah. - Well I don't. You're wack and so are your wheels. Toby tell carrot head to get outta here. - Dirk maybe it's-- - You got a problem with this Toby? - Get lost Maguire. I said leave! - Scram! - Want me to grind your face in Maguire? Move nitwit! - [Boy] Oh! (tense music) (man groans) (boys grunting and groaning) (groans) - Gah. (motorcycle approaching) (tense music) - Could we ride your ATVs? - Why should I let you? - Follow me and you're in for a showdown. - Cool. - Great. (engines revving) (lively tense music) (magical music) (ATV engines roaring) (tense music) - Hey Maguire I'll get you next time, capisce? - You really flew over the ravine. - I guess so. It was trippy. - How'd you do it? - I don't know. But I think it was the shoes. - Really what happened? - Well I was running and then my feet got kind of warm and electric and then next thing I knew I was flying. - Cool. Do you want to see if you can fly again? - Well maybe. - Okay I'm watching. - Here goes! (magical music) (Nicki screams) (Ryan thuds) - Ryan are you okay? - Uh. Agh! - That was fantastic. Until you hit the tree. - Yeah. (chuckles) (Nicki laughs) (spooky music) (loud creaking) (wolf howling) (Ryan screams) - Sit down boy. Oh those shoes look fine with your dad's reflectors on them. - Yeah they're cool. - So you uh, seen the ghost yet? - What? - Have you met the ghost yet? You heard things right, you're not deaf are ya? - Well sometimes I hear creaking sounds and-- - Wind whistles and footsteps? - Yeah. - Well you've heard ol' Theo Magoogan Maguire. - You really believe he's still here as a ghost? - Whatever it is, I say why not take all the help you can get. (snapping) - Ryan? Ryan are you still up? Oh Rita. - Say no more Annie. It's late, probably time for the boy to get some sleep. As for me I have to get out to that old orchard and finish my pruning. - Didn't mean to interrupt. - Nothing wrong with interruptions (laughs) I do it all the time. Back to work for me. - Sure is nice out here. - Yeah. - You know it seems a perfect place for a camp out. Maybe you can invite your friend Nicki over for dinner tomorrow night and the two of you can sleep out here in sleeping bags. I spoke to her mom today. - That'd be fun. - Good. Now-- - I know. (serene music) (phone ringing) - Morning. - I hope it's not too early. Can I talk to Nicki please? - We're always awake around here. Bunny take the phone to Nicki okay? - Here Nicki. - Hello. - Nicki, I want to heel down at the park. Do you want to meet me there? (quirky music) Nicki did you hear me? - Uh yeah, what did you say? - [Ryan] I said see ya at the park in an hour. (quirky music) (serene music) (whistles) Whoa. Thanks Aunt Rita. - Yes a very nice antique. - (laughing) Well aren't you gonna ask me what that key unlocks? Well a key's not good for anything unless it has a lock to open, you know that don't ya? - Okay, what's it unlock then? - That key unlocks the barn. Now in the old days it was for horses but now it's a place for you boy. And because you're my family, my things are your things, you just treat them with respect. (geese honking) (seagulls cawing) - Supposedly there's so much stuff in that barn and Aunt Rita says I can turn the place into my own. - When can I see it? - Tonight. Come over and have dinner. - Cool. Hey you seem to have gotten the hang of your Heelys so why not try flying again? - I don't know. There's so many trees around here. - Well head for the lake, it's shallow. You'll be fine. Come on Ryan. - What, and I'm supposed to just run down the dock and swooo? - Exactly. I know you can do it Ryan, go for it. - On my mark, get set, get set. - Come on Ryan. - Here I go. (upbeat rock music) (magical music) - Ryan! Oh my gosh! (splashes) Ryan! (splashing) (cows mooing) - What if they're ruined? - You can't just destroy magic with one dip in the lake. - I don't know they look a mess. - It wouldn't make sense. Magic transcends logic. This is just mud and weeds. And don't forget, you did just fly. - It was trippy. - My cousin will have just what you need. Always taking apart and fixing things. And they have a pool too. And I think it's time you learned how to swim. (cows mooing) (splashes) - See the wheels pop in. - Mm hmm, just use some steel wool and clean 'em. - Think that'll work Lou. - It's a first step. They'll be fine. - How goes it? - I'll fix 'em. - Great. Now jump in Ryan. (splashes) (light cheerful music) (steel guitar chord) (Ryan gasps) - Gotcha loser! - Grow up. - What you think you're so tough. We'll see about that one of these days punk. (edgy rock music) (ducks quacking) (geese honking) (crickets chirping) - Will you just settle down over there. We've got a special visitor coming over tonight. - I'm trying Aunt Rita. - Oh it's not you Ryan. - What's not Ryan. (spooky wind blowing) - It's Theodore Magoogan Maguire isn't it? - Yup. Yup. Oh Annie you look fancy. You expecting company as well tonight. - No of course not. - Well fine by me if you start dating. Just not one of them needle poking doctors. Just the sight of those guys just makes people sick. - Well not to worry. - Yeah. - Ryan. I got my first paycheck at work today and... - Thanks! (Annie chuckles) It's brand new. (spooky music) (howling) (Nicki screams) - That was so bad. I was so freaked. You're right about this place at night. Spooky. - Okay, what's the capital of Venezuela? - Caracas. - Feeling normal now? - Yes. - So tell me about some of the other kids your age. - How do you mean? - Well who are some of the boys you'll be in school with next year? - Well there's Toby Forest. - Oh the Forest family, they're good people. - Yeah and he hangs out with Dirk Cooper. - The Coopers, that's another story. - Well how do you mean? - Well he's kind of-- - Spoiled, mean and rich. - You got that right. - But one mans trash is another persons treasure. (spooky music) - This is creepy. You know everyone in town says this place is haunted. I believe it. - My aunt thinks her great grandfather's a ghost here. - Really? - Yeah that's why she stays up most nights and sleeps in the day, ghosts are more rowdy at night. - What was that? - Could be Theodore Magoogan Maguire. - No. - My dad coulda built this. The reflector's the same as mine. You know I was thinking, maybe there are ghosts or something magical. How else could my Heelys fly? - It is unexplainable, in the traditional sense. (whining) Is that him? Theodore? (whining) - It sounds so close. - Weird. - Look. (whining) - It's a skunk. - No the tail isn't right. - [Nicki] Raccoon? (dog barks) - It's a dog. - That's the strangest looking dog I've ever seen. (whimpers) - Good dog. Oh man you smell. - He reeks. (whining) - See he's looking better now. - I don't know about that but he shouldn't smell so pukey soon. - He's perfect. I really wanna keep him. (yips) We have to sneak him inside. - Okay. - Coast is clear. - Ryan? - Uh, hi, goodnight. (dog whining) (coughing) - Ah choo! - Oh gesundheit. Eeeh chu. - Thanks. (crickets chirping) (giggles) He is kind of cute. In an ugly, funny way. - I really like him. I'm gonna name him Theo after my great great grandfather. - You sure you'll be able to keep him? - I have a plan. (gentle music) - Dirk Cooper! Dirk Cooper! Dirk Cooper you come down here at once and clean up your belongings! - I'm sleeping. - How many times have I told you not to leave your things out overnight? Get down here at once! - I'm going back to bed. If it bothers you so much, you pick 'em up! - Donna is that kid mouthing off to you again? - Oh Frank he just doesn't listen to me. I have told him so many times that the night mist just ruins these expensive things that we buy him. - Well maybe he needs more than words. Maybe then he'll learn. - Frank? - This'll teach him a lesson. I'll take the can down for pickup. And then I'll be back for coffee and you. Capisce? - I do capisce. (purring) (quirky music) - Stay Theo and please don't bark. Here she comes. Boy is she gonna be surprised. - I think you're right about that. - You don't understand, you see, everyday she leaves a present on my seat at breakfast but this time I have a present for her. - Ugh! What's that rodent doing in the house? (Nicki screams) - Is everything okay? - It's just a dog. - It's not a dog that's a rat, a opossum, a raccoon. We need an exterminator. - I thought it looked like a skunk but it actually barks. So it has to be a dog. Simple deduction. - And it's clean too. We bathed it with soap and everything. - Ryan, remember what I said about bringing a dog here? - I didn't it was already here in the barn. - In this barn? - Yes. Which means, it could mean that it's meant to be here. - And how do you figure that? - Well maybe Theodore Magoogan Maguire had a dog. And this could be one of it's descendants. - You think so boy, you think this is a Maguire mutt relation. - It's possible. - And what were you planning on doing with this dog descendant of yours? - I named him Theo and he's a gift from me to you Aunt Ri. (dog whining) - Well I'll have to mull this over awhile. You all sit down, start your muffins, I've got something for you boy. Looks like I ruined the muffins. Look all the kids in town seem to have one of these I thought you might like one too. - I've never had a skateboard before. - Just be careful okay, you know how I feel about those-- - Mom! I'll be fine. Thanks Aunt Ri. (porch swing creaking) (dog whining) (barks) - All right Theo if you must. (snoring) (edgy rock music) (laughing) - Awesome! - Hey, hey there! - Oh no, not Dirk again. - Is that carrot head? - Looks like it. Hey when did he get a skateboard? - That's what I want to know. - Wanna leave? - I'm not running anymore. - What are you doing here? - It's a public skate park. - And when did you get a skateboard? - Today. - Looks kinda used. - Whatever. - Hey turn it over. Is that my red sticker with the flame thrower on the bottom? Did you steal my board? - No, I-- Is that my board Maguire? - Yeah I think it is. - Yeah see the grind marks and the stickers? - But I didn't steal your board. - Yeah well how else are you gonna explain it? - My aunt gave it to me. - Then your aunt's a thief too. - Dirk you said your dad trashed yours. - Toby shut up I'm talking to carrot head here. Well? - I, I... - Is this your new soccer ball? Well I'm not stealing it either. I'm not through with you yet Maguire. You and your whole family are thieves and I'll get even with all of you. - [Group] Yeah. - I still don't get it. - It's like this in the early mornings your aunt goes around to all the streets with their trash cans out and... - And what? - She picks stuff out of the trash that she likes, puts it in her truck and takes it here. - She doesn't steal. - Right. She's just a trash picker or a scavenger nothing's wrong with it. - How do you know this Nicki? - I saw her across the street from my house trash picking. - Bummer. - But hey it's not so bad. You got your Heelys that way. - Yeah, do you think they'll still uh...? - Fly? - Yeah. But wait. How did my aunt get Dirk's skateboard? - I don't know exactly but I bet Dirk's dad had something to do with it and I'm also sure your aunt did nothing wrong. (water running) - Oh Theo you let me be. I got chores to do. (smooching) Oh I bet you little skunk mutt. (smooching) Theo. (smooching) You are the cutest thing oh! (Nicki giggling) (smooching) (dog barks) - Uh, hi. - Well I, I hope this skunk mutt doesn't keep me from getting my chores done. - I'm sure you have everything under control. (dog yips) - Well, yes. Oh Ryan I almost forgot your mother called she's gonna be late tonight she's covering for one of the other nurses. - I understand. - And she wants me to remind you that you need to brush your teeth-- - Brush my teeth, wash my face and don't stay up too late. - Well, yes. (smooching) (dog yipping and whining) - Do you think my aunt Rita is really old or just old? - Hard to tell. She's so rambunctious. She could be 55, she could be 75. - I think it's a good thing my mom and I moved in with her. - Before you moved in she was probably lonely in this big old empty house. - Sometimes I'm not so sure it's totally empty if you know what I mean. (owl hooting) - I wonder if I'll be alone when I'm old? - You won't. I'll always be your pal. - And me yours. - Goodnight Nicki. - Sweet dreams. (dramatic music) - First we destroy the place. - Yeah. - I'm ready. - Then what? - Then we steal something valuable. - Why? - Because Maguire stole my skateboard so we need to steal something back. - But you said your dad trashed-- - Toby do you want to go home now? - No. - Then stuff it. (howling) - [Dirk] Come on. (howling) - Dirk I think it might be hard to find anything of value in this old dump. - Yeah you're so right about that. - I wonder if this place is really haunted? - Don't chicken out now, come on. Come on. Let's get started. (gun cocking) (guns shooting) (laughing) You take this. I like the look of this sledge hammer. Ha ha ha. Go on use it Toby. (gun shoots) - Ryan. I hear something. - At this house I always hear things at night. Don't worry. (Dirk laughing) (smashing) Dirk. (guns shooting) We got to stop him. Get out! Get outta here! Go on get out! Get outta here! Just take your buddies and leave! - Make me. - I said leave! - And I said watch this. (sinister laughing) (glass smashing) Ugh! (glass smashing) (glass smashing) (dog barks) - Theo! (barks) (sinister laughing) No Theo! (weed wacker whirring) - Ghost, it's a ghost. (Toby yells) (Aunt Rita thuds) - Aunt Rita. Are you okay? Call 911. I'm so sorry. (sirens) - [Intercom] Paging Dr. Dana Kline. Please come to the OR. - She's broken her hip she may need surgery. - Don't you put me under the knife. - Something to think about. - You think all you want doctor the answer's no. - Rita stay calm. What can be done in the meantime? - Complete bed rest. - Good, I have a bed at home. - I need to keep her here for two to three days for some observation. - Keep her? Well her wants to know just exactly what troubles you doctor. - Please Rita take it easy. Dr. Warzecka's only trying to help. - She has an irregular heartbeat and her kidney function's declining-- - I'm breathin' and I'm talkin' aren't I? Now Annie take me home. - Rita you know I can't do that. But seeing as how I work here it'll seem like home. - Huh. - Thank you doctor. - I want to be alone. - [Intercom] Paging Dr... (sad music) - She's just scared. She's never spent the night in a hospital before in fact I think she was born at home. - Annie, your aunt doesn't have any health insurance. I can make arrangements to send her over to county-- - Keep her here. I'll pay whatever it costs, I'll work two shifts a day. - Are you sure you can handle that? - Three if you let me. Ryan? - How's Aunt Rita? - She'll be alright. She just needs to spend some time here that's all. (intercom in distance) (sad music) - It's not like how Aunt Rita makes it is it? - Oh I know you feel bad but there's nothing we can do about it. Rita did ask about the dog. - They stole Theo. - What? - Dirk Cooper stole the dog. - I'm gonna get Theo back and I don't care how tough Dirk thinks he is. - Ryan I don't want you approaching these bad kids. I'll call their parents. Just stay away from them alright? (lighthearted music) (Nicki screams) - I've got to find Theo. - I hope he's okay. - You can stay here if you like I'm gonna find Theo. - Wait up for me. (edgy rock music) Ryan I don't feel good about this. - You don't have to come. Anybody seen Dirk around? - Get off the ramp. - I will once you tell me where Dirk is. - I don't know I'm not his mommy. (laughing) - Well if you see him tell him I'm looking for him. - Yeah whatever. - I can't believe you did that! That was so right on. (seagulls cawing) (light suspenseful music) - Stop moving around so much are you stupid? Ugh. - There he is! - Fishing, like father like son. - Bassholes. - I'm gonna get some more bait do ya need any? - No dad. - Catch something while I'm gone, capisce? - I capisce. - Hey! - Hey! - So let's not even deal with you breaking things, messing up the barn and being a total jerk! - What? - Just tell me where my dog is. - I don't know what you're talking about Maguire. I don't even like the way you're talking to me. You hear that carrot head? - Call me what you like but tell me where my dog is. - Yeah and what if I don't? - Dirk Cooper! - [Ryan] Let's go. - I don't know what you're doing but it isn't fishing. Here put fresh bait on those hooks, capisce? - Capisce. (light banjo and harmonica music) (tribal music) - You haven't eaten all day. You're not sleeping and you're not speaking, won't you just tell me what you want? ♪ Footprints in the sand ♪ ♪ Lost in the tide ♪ ♪ Asking for reasons and wondering why ♪ ♪ Reaching for stars ♪ ♪ Searching the sky ♪ ♪ Learning the meaning of being alive ♪ ♪ When dreams come true ♪ ♪ I'll be in love with you ♪ ♪ When dreams come true ♪ ♪ I'll be in love with you ♪ (clapping and cheering) - What do you want? - I'm not here to hassle you or anything. - What is it? - [Toby] I'm sorry about your crazy aunt. - [Ryan] Don't call her crazy. - Sorry. - Hey Toby wait. If you really are sorry tell me where Dirk took her dog. - Dirk wouldn't like me to. - Dude just tell me. - Dirk sold the dog to his cousin Derek who works at the old gold mine. He's gonna train it to be a guard dog. - He's gonna train it to be a guard dog? - That dog's mean he bit Dirk. - Did Dirk hit my dog? - I told you all I know. You won't tell Dirk right? - I won't. (adventurous music) Well Theodore Magoogan Maguire if you're really here I could use the help. (upbeat rock music) Whoa! (lively energetic music) Theo. - Derek, you gonna pay me ten bucks for your new guard dog or what? - Aww Dirk, it's gonna take some time to train him to be tough enough. - What do you mean, look he already bit me. - Aww that's nothing. I keep that mutt hungry for a day or two he'll bite like a shark. (suspenseful music) - So about the ten bucks? - Hit the metal inside the tire for double or nothing. - What? That's not fair. You probably do it all the time. - I'll pay you five bucks no matter what. - Ten capisce? - Put some muscle into it cousin. (laughs) That was funny. Hey I do my rounds inside the grinding mill, you wanna come? - Sure. - Theo! (Dirk talking in distance) - Who's up there? Derek is that you? - Dirk what's up with the clipboard? - Who's up there? Hey it's the Maguire punk, what are you doing here? - I came to get my dog back. - I sold it. - He's not yours to sell. - But I thought I bought it? - Ugh! (energetic tense music) - Watch it jerk. - You shoved me. - We gotta get this kid outta here. - There he is. - Let's corner him. - We've got you jerk head Maguire! - You're trapped kid. - I'm out of here. (tense music intensifies) - What? (energetic tense music) - Did he just? - Come on! Wait right there kid. - He got the dog. (upbeat rock music) He's... - Flying. (birds cawing) - Ugh!
