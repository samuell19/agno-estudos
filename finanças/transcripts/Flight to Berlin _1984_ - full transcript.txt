OFFICER: Date of birth? 17th of June, 1951. Place of birth? Berlin. Do you live in Berlin? No, in London. Occupation? Will somebody please tell me why I've been brought here? You know why you're here. Just tell us your occupation. Tourist. Your profession! I do surveys for the government. A civil servant. What's so funny? Nothing. Will this take long? As long as it takes. Put down civil servant. I'm not trying to hide anything. I don't know the connections, and I don't know what you want me to tell you. The facts. I don't know the facts. Your case? Is that your case? Yes. What was it doing in the apartment of a wanted man? He said I could leave it there. It's heavy. Is it your habit to walk into the apartment of a wanted criminal in the middle of the night? No. So you know he's a criminal? I didn't say that. I met Edouard once or twice in my life. Edouard? Yes, Edouard. Are you intimate with this man Edouard? I hardly know him. SCOFFS: With respect, thousands of people in this city are being intimate with strangers even as we speak. Ask my friend here. But these are your clothes? Yes. Tell us why we found them on the floor of Edouard's bedroom. I didn't take them off for him. - For someone else, then? - Jack. Jack? Jack took me there. He knows Edouard. I don't know his other name. - Not an old friend? - No. But intimate? You have any other friends in Berlin apart from this Jack? Yes, I have a sister who lives here. She knows Edouard, but you'd have to ask her about their relationship. What's her name? Julie. Julie Lawrence. Let us start again. Why did you walk into the apartment of a wanted man in the middle of the night, in whose bedroom we found your suitcase, clearly labelled, and a pile of your discarded clothes? NARRATES: 'They asked me the wrong questions. 'I don't know the facts they wanted. 'They'll come back and offer me a different set of questions 'about something that happened in another city. 'And this time, they'll insist I know the answers.' PA: Passengers to Berlin, flight... 'But do I?' 'I know what happened. 'But I can't explain how it happened. 'All I remember is standing by the top of the stairs. 'Standing by the top of the stairs.' £50. Ciao. Do you know? I love Berlin. It's a city that's mysterious. It has magic. I worked here with a young director. I made three pictures with him. He was brilliant. He never made any money, but he kept working, he kept working, working, working, working. Finally, he sold his soul to the devil, and he made $1 million. And he promptly dropped dead. But...he had magic. 'A flight of stairs. 'A flight to Berlin. 'A flight from the past. 'I took a flight. 'Or to be more honest, I took flight.' SHE SPEAKS GERMAN Ja. 'I want to look over my shoulder, 'but I don't want to see the past.' Look, no German money. 'She threw herself into my arms, 'as if I could save her. 'That's what frightens me. 'It was as though she was blaming me... ...for her life.' SHE SOBS KNOCK ON DOOR WOMAN: Wieso? MAN: Julie, it's Jack. Oh, tell him I just went out. - Say I was sorry I missed him. - I'll tell him. Tell him I left town. What's put us in such a great mood? We died of boredom. We waited until we decided we couldn't wait any longer. We decided we'd rather do it with someone else than wait another second for some coddled prick with no sense of time. PHONE RINGS We get ourselves fixed up elsewhere, understand? I came as quick as I could. SHE LAUGHS Hallo? Oh, Susannah. Where are you? What, here? That's great. What are you up to? What? On your own? Do need a bed? No, it's OK, I'm in a hotel. Let's meet this evening? Fancy you turning up in Berlin! Not tonight, I'm really tired. What about tomorrow? Tomorrow? OK. Is anything wrong, Susannah? No, nothing's wrong. You sound strange. Why didn't you write? Oh, I just had to get away. You sound different. Where are you? I don't know. Bye. Susannah, well, well. - Someone from England? - You're still here? - Are these yours? - Yep. Silly, aren't they? Who was that on the phone? Are you looking at me or admiring yourself? I'm trying to look at you, I keep seeing myself. Who phoned? - My sister. - Your sister? - You have a sister? - Yep. - Is she as beautiful as you? - No. Is her disposition as sweet as yours? She makes me seem like Shirley Temple. In fact, I hardly know her. Ah! Well, since you found your cheque, any chance you could see your way to lending me 100? - Please. - Please. What do you mean you hardly know your sister? Because we didn't grow up together. - Why not? - It's too hard to explain. - Here, that's all yours. - Thank you. I like complicated explanations. - Do you? - Mm-hm. I have to work now, huh? What about tomorrow? I can find some time in the morning. Don't call us, we'll call you. Why didn't you grow up together? Because she went to England. - So she's English? - Yes. - And your German? - Yep. And now shut the door behind you, please. The English sister. SHE SPEAKS GERMAN How much? Danke schön. 'Stuck in a strange city. 'Trying to pretend I'm on holiday. 'You make a quick decision, buy a ticket, 'get on a plane and leave the past behind. 'Then by some trick, 'you find the path still ahead of you, waiting.' Guess what? I got married. - When? - A while ago. What's his name? - Who? - Your husband. Don't ask, he's such an arsehole. In fact, he was rather good in bed. I didn't think rich men would be. But he hardly ever sleeps with me. Maybe he's homosexual and has forgotten to tell me so! SHE LAUGHS It's a marriage of convenience. Well, it's convenient for me. Is that why you married him? No. He indulges my bad habits. One day we were bored, it was raining, so we got married. Isn't that how most people do it? Why didn't you tell me? Susannah, it was a joke! I've hardly ever seen him since. Julie, you surprise me. About what? I'm just fooling around. OK, what I was saying was just fooling. - Was it? - Yeah. TYRES SCREECH SHE SPEAKS GERMAN HE SPEAKS GERMAN We should take a holiday, huh? Yeah. I'm tired? Bahamas? Your fly's open. Oh! HE LAUGHS Hey, have we seen Fast Eddie lately? Mr Constantine to you. IT BUZZES Who is this woman? She was quite famous once. Then all of a sudden she went into hiding. Why? No-one knows. A bit of mystery. Not much of an occupation, hiding. Well, I don't know. You could find your hands quite full. Look, if she refuses to be photographed, you'll have to help me, OK? Why should she? She knows we're coming. She's impossible. Ask her for an autograph or something. - Why me? - Who else? Guten Tag. SHE SPEAKS GERMAN SHE ANSWERS IN GERMAN Come on, Julie, we'll come back tomorrow. Ah, someone called, yes, when I was asleep. I suppose you had better come in. I'm afraid that it's not possible to photograph me. It won't take but a second, please. I am photographed to death. You look fine, great. Really. You're like jackals with your camera. Snap, snap, snap! OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYS Terrific. Now she's gone back into hiding. Do you think that's it? How do I know? The whole thing is a bloody disaster. DOOR BANGS SUSANNAH: What a beautiful coat. It reminds me of Ninotchka. Or do I mean Queen Christina? Wolves howling across the steppes. - You like this fur? - Yes. This is wolf. - Try it on. - No, thank you. - No? - Really. Take it, please. I've got another somewhere. I've got three or four. I've got mink too. Take it. No, but I would like one of these. Would you autograph it for me? I... Ha! What shall I put? Put, "To Julie," and the date. The date? July 12th. - July? - Yes. - Oh. - Thank you. I have put, "To Julie, a very sweet girl." I'm afraid you will have to go now. I want to go to bed about now. Thank you. Ah... Are you sure? You don't want to have this old fur? SUSANNAH: No, really, I couldn't. THEY LAUGH You must have killed a lot of people. Yeah, about 300, 400. And died yourself a few times? Yeah. How does it feel killing that many people? Well, it gets a little boring. Better than dying. - Who are the pictures for? - Some big syndicate. Did you ever have your picture in the paper? - No. - Maybe you'll be famous. I don't want to be famous. Can't you cut me out of the picture? And ruin the framing? I don't want my picture in the paper. I think you need all the publicity you can get. Thanks. Publicity is the last thing I need at the moment. I need looking after. I should have gone to Paris. I have friends there. Julie, I'm in a bit of trouble at the moment, I really am. - What happened about Nicholas? - He's in London. Poor Nicholas. Look, I don't want my picture in the paper. OK, OK. Suit yourself. I have to see someone. Can I come? No, sorry. I won't be long. Half an hour. OK, let's say half an hour exactly. It's 3.03. Synchronised? I'm still on English time. OK. Synchronised. So, I'll be back at 3.33. All the threes and the flowers and the bees! - Are you fine here? - I'll have to be. By the way... This was yours. Where did you find it? I came across it yesterday. See you. Bye. Excuse me, are you looking at me or at yourself? Neither, actually. You're looking at yourself now, aren't you? No. Since you spoke to me, I'm looking at you. Ah, I'm glad you said that, because I'm definitely looking at you. Now, why would you want to do that? Eyes have got a mind of their own. Once I take it into my head to look at something beautiful, there's nothing I can do to stop it. - Is that a fact? - Yes. SHE LAUGHS My eyes send me urgent messages about the beautiful things they're seeing. Your eyes, your lips, your hair. And I am powerless to contradict them. You see? I'm completely helpless when I get one of these urgent messages. - What's your name? - Marianne. SUSANNAH: How did you know I was English? MAN: Your shoes. German ones are different somehow. SUSANNAH: More fashionable? I think these were made in Italy. THEY SPEAK IN GERMAN Are you always such a pushover? Hey, it was me who started this thing. Is that the way you see it? I spoke to you first. - You were wonderful. - Hm. - I came over. - I reeled you in. MAN: It was me who had the line. SUSANNAH: Not a very original one. MAN: Well, it worked. SUSANNAH: Where did you find it? It came to me. It's called swallowing the bait. I suppose you think you dragged me back to your hotel as well. By the way, what's your name? It's Jack. Marianne. DOOR OPENS Who's Julie? Thanks. I really needed that. Any time. HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN What kept you, lover boy? Traffic's terrible. HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN Traffic, my ass. More like some nice lady, who couldn't wait, huh? No flies on our Jack. You've got ten minutes starting from now to get me to the other side of town. - Right. - Is she any good? Come on, we've got ten minutes. We're wasting time. I'll tell you in the car. If you can make it... ...I dare say I'll give you the rest of the day off. MAN WITH IRISH ACCENT NEXT DOOR: I'm not joking. I have felt that feeling of peace, know what I mean? Even though I knew she'd betrayed me. These things are very painful. SHE RUNS TAP I never spoke. Not once. KNOCK AT DOOR - Oh. - Putzen. Nein, danke. I'll do it, I'll do it. - Ich muss putzen. - No, no, no. Danke, danke. MAN NEXT DOOR: You don't think that memory is just...? PHONE RINGS JULIE: Ja. MAN ON PHONE: Hello, Julie. This is Nicholas in London. Oh, hello, Nicholas. I know this sounds rather strange but have you heard from Susannah? She's disappeared. I'm sure she'll turn up. NICHOLAS: It's not like her. I'm worried about her. Oh, Nicholas, she can look after herself. She's in some kind of trouble. The police want to talk to her. That's ridiculous. They must have got the wrong person. Tell them not to be so stupid. NICHOLAS: What do you mean? She's probably just run off with another man. What? Oh, yes. Do you have the number here? JULIE: Give it to me just in case. FAINT CONVERSATION IN GERMAN HE WHISTLES Julie, you can't come in here. What the fuck you playing at, going off with Susannah? - Kannst du nicht lesen? - Verpiss dich. MAN IN CUBICLE: Where am I? Am I in the little girls' place? No, it's the boys' place. There's a little boy out here with his flies undone and his prick in his hand. Both of them are looking pretty ashamed, I would say. MAN: So what's it to you? A few hours ago this piss artist tried to seduce my sister and contaminates her with his spineless personality. MAN: Listen, lady, I've got problems of my own. Personally, I'd like to be part of your sister's sex life. Ha! How can I? You know... Julie, you can't stay here. MAN: I'm in therapy... Explain yourself! It was your description, Jack! Your description, right down to your white shoes! MAN: I've been in here half an hour with nothing to show for it. Then you two show up. My description? What's she supposed to look like? You should know! A mole on her thigh and answers to the name of Susannah. MAN: Hey, clear out if you're talking about something more practical. - Shut up. - Thank you. Exactly. I'd be pretty careful of this sister, if I was you. Susannah, is it? - Get on with it. - Well... Well, she says her name is Marianne. - Who? - She's fine-looking but completely crazy, going around picking up total strangers, calling herself Marianne. - Susannah isn't like that. - How do you know? Are you sure you've got the right sister? It doesn't sound like Marianne at all. Check her out at the hotel. TOILET FLUSHES How can I relax if you two turn this into a French farce? You've pissed on your white shoes. Taxi! Bitte, eine Bratwurst. MAN NEXT DOOR: There'll be a day of judgment, believe you me. You know what'll happen? Americans find it really difficult, you know, to understand the really weird weather we seem to have over here with all the different temperatures and centigrade and approximate rainfall. For instance, do you know how much rain falls in Ireland during August? It's something unbelievable. Or is it Scotland? That's part of England, right? Have you got any change for the phone? And right alongside the weather they have a column for the wardrobe suggestions, telling you what you have to include in your packing considerations if you don't want to get completely soaked, or burned alive, or frozen, or just blown away. MAN NEXT DOOR: About this charge... KNOCK ON DOOR You're going to be shown all the traces of your sin. WOMAN: Telefon. MAN: Trail like a slug's... - Telefon. - For me? Ja. Gehen Sie unter. Aber merken Sie sich. Das Telefon ist nicht für Gäste da. JACK: I'd like to see you. - I've gone to bed. - How could you? - Easily. - I have to talk to you. It's too late. There's something I want to give you. Look, first you want to see me, then you want to talk to me, now you want to give me things. Now, what do I want with all that at this time of night? I want to make love to you. Goodnight, Jack. See you in the morning. Thanks. HE SIGHS Shit. 'Tomorrow I will walk through the city. 'I'll be completely without fear. 'Everything will be unexpected.' SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR WOMAN SPEAKS GLASS SHATTERS Your excuse? Sorry. Mademoiselle? Bonsoir? PHONE RINGS RADIO: But of course you do have the option of taking no action at all at this time. For more information or assistance, call... PHONE STILL RINGING ...6111. That's 2311... Putain de merde! MAN WHISTLES Hello. Hello, hello, mademoiselle. Hello! Lady of the night. This morning I'm really in distress. Look. My whole reputation hangs by a thread. Sorry? My whole reputation hangs by a thread. You have any cotton and a needle? As a matter of fact, I do. You English - so practical. You remember the way? Black or white? I have a confession to make. I can't sew. Please, could you? I want to talk to you anyway. What about? I think I can help you. I don't need any help. I think you do. What makes you think that? I can see by your face that you're in trouble. There's no need to be afraid. You are quite safe here. You can speak freely. I know you are running away. Don't be ridiculous. I'm just here for a few days' holiday. I know all about you. Believe me. Hallo. If you came to me and said, "Look, I've killed a...Chinaman... "What should I do?" I would say, "Do nothing. "Leave everything in my hands. "Go away and sleep quietly in your bed." In 24 hours, that same Chinaman would not have been killed. Or rather, to put it another way, you would not have killed him. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? I can help you if you trust me. I have friends and influence and certain powers that are not...inconsiderable. Some say my powers are magical. You are in trouble with the police, that's true, isn't it? Yes, it's true. CAMERA CLICKS Who told you? Hm? - It's not so important. - How could you know? Who sent you here? You're safe with me. This is the whole point. Shit, shit, shit! MEN SHOUT IN GERMAN WIND GUSTS I'm not that bothered what you said. Look, Charlie, I don't care if he drives a bloody Saracen tank, just tell him Jack wants a word with him. Get back to me pronto. Sorry about that. I should have stayed in bed. Well, there's a bed next door. Stayed in bed, I said, not go to bed. Jack... Can I cut your hair? - I don't want it cut. - Oh, please, just a trim. No. One of yours? GAME BEEPS Not my type. Is this your place? No, it belongs to a friend. What does your friend do? He's a... He's a dealer. - What kind of dealer? - Oh, things. This and that. So he's a villain? He likes to think so. And how come he lets you use his place? Well, he owes me something. For a deal? You know, if I was rich, I'd pay somebody to brush my hair for at least an hour a day. GAME STILL BEEPING What kind of a deal? I bet it was over the woman in the Polaroid. Wasn't it?! - Wasn't it, Jack? - Hey. Yeah. It was. So your friend deals in women? You're impossible, Marianne. SHE LAUGHS - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. No, in Berlin. Never sleep with a woman with more problems than you. I don't know who said it, Jack, but it's good advice. PHONE RINGS PHONE STILL RINGING Hello. Yeah. Hello, Charlie. I didn't think quite that quick. OK. I'm coming. I've got to go. Sorry, I've got to go. Stay here and I'll see you later. Sorry. SUSANNAH: Thanks. DOOR CLOSES 'For days now... '...I've had this feeling that I'm always in the wrong place.' Hello, Julie. It's me. I'm bored. Let's go sightseeing. Where? OK. Bye. Hello. Thanks. Thanks for waiting in the café. - You said half an hour. - I was ten minutes late. So what kept you? What was so important that you couldn't wait? Years ago. Sorry. Julie, I'm sorry. - Nicholas phoned up. - And? I told him you were here. Oh. Thanks a lot. - Where are you going? - I don't know! You slept a long time. - What time is it? - It's still early. Why did you come in here? What's the matter? Are you angry? What about? What did you say? I said, "Are you hungry?" I thought you said, "Are you angry?" Yes, I am. Hungry. Right. Let's eat. Hey, you want to try this on? We're meeting somebody important. I don't want to wear some other woman's clothes. Yeah? What are you wearing now? I don't care. I'd rather wear my own. Take me to the hotel. - Are we having a row? - You might be. BELL RINGS - Is it very high? - Yeah, quite high. I'm not very good at heights. What are you doing here? Hi. Marianne, this is Carlotta. I was born in Hollywood in 1917. But never made a picture there. Did a lot in Europe. Can't remember how many. But...they're no good. Some of them have a reputation. Nobody will remember them. That's not the point. What is the point? We've met somewhere, haven't we? No, I don't think so. Oh, I never forget a face. You're English. - Hmm. - Don't say anything. I'll get it. - Are you here alone? - Yes. Ah. But you have friends. I have a sister who lives here. You never told me that. Ah, what is your name? Marianne. Oh, Marianne. Wonderful. I love that name. I rescued a girl on a picture once. Her name was Marianne. Or maybe it was Natasha. Doesn't matter. There were so many. You look like you're in a spot of trouble yourself. Who, me? I spent my lifetime with girls in a mess. I know all the signs. Never really look like they're in trouble. PA ANNOUNCEMENT IN GERMAN What do you think of this actor who is running America now? I think he's a pretty good horse actor. He's energetic and amiable. It's a pity when you think that politics ruined a perfectly respectable career in B westerns. He thought he was moving into reality. In my opinion, he left reality in Hollywood, where he came from. You never told me you had a sister. - I wonder if he might be... - It didn't seem important. Does that mean you don't like her? - ...good in the film I'm making. -Did I say that? - She's older than you? - Yes. More beautiful? OTHER CONVERSATION CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY I'm curious about your sister. Tell me about her. There's nothing to tell. We're sisters, that's all. And I prevent a nuclear war... - You sound disappointed. - I wear a brown suit... - Not really. - And a hat. She was always the favourite when you were young. Oh, I don't know. I suppose so. So you were always a bit jealous of her? I saw some of the Russians... - What's it to you, Jack? - I'm curious. It seems like a hot day in hell. By the way... ...don't they have air conditioning here? In Berlin? Berlin doesn't have air conditioning? No, Reagan is proof... You were jealous of her and at the same time you admired her, am I right? - The systems that needed... - Not at all. You admired her because she always seemed to know what she wanted and she went and took it. You wanted to want things in the same way as she did - but you were too nice. - Oh, shut up. No... No meaning. Hey, what about our friend Edouard? I don't know, he should be here. He should be here. Then later you realise there's no end to your sister's ambition. She could never be satisfied. She'd missed out on life. Am I right? Jack, you don't even know her. Haven't we met before? A Polaroid. Remember I told you I was owed something over a deal? The deal was over Carlotta. She never even realised. Oh. Everybody has their problems. Mine is an empty glass. Order some more, son. You owe the lady a drink. Was it an accident? This woman was found dead in her home. She was...lying at the bottom of the stairs. Police think Susannah might know something. Was this woman her friend? No. It was an appointment. To interview her. But if it was an accident... They don't think it was an accident. Come on. It doesn't look so good. I want to go home. You know, it's rude to leave before the bill. Look, boy, the lady wants to go... the lady can go. Nothing you can do about it. I'll take you down. One thing I learned in life is you've got to roll with the punches. Do you know what rolling with the punches is? - No. - Give me your hand. All right. There. The other one. That's rolling with the punches. So you think I didn't know? Schmuck! And did you always rescue the girl? Yeah. And what was your advice to a girl in trouble? Like I told you, roll with the punches. Better still... Don't let them get too close. Keep a...moving target. A moving target is very hard to hit. Goodnight. And good luck. ENGINE STARTS AIRPLANE ROARS BY The city of magic. Nicholas is here, isn't he? He was, I sent him to a hotel. He's your husband. He told you everything, I suppose? Yes, he did. I know she fell down the stairs. But I have this image that she...jumped. She kind of threw herself into my arms as though I could save her. And that's what frightens me. It's as if she was... ...blaming me for her life. Did I push her? I can't talk about it now. What about Nicholas? You couldn't tell him? SOBS: I haven't been able to talk to Nicholas for years. You know, when I saw that woman lying dead, I saw myself. I opened the window, and I let the wind take her soul. Julie? Where did you get this? Nicholas left it last night. What time's he coming? Soon. He's worried about you. Oh, yes, I'm sure he is. I can just see it. "Susannah, thank goodness you're all right," he'll say. "I've come to take you home. "Everything'll be fine, you'll see." And then ten minutes later, he'll ask me if I took his camera. And then we'll have a row because I did. How can I help you? I'll find a way to get rid of him, OK? Come back tonight. SUSANNAH: Tell him I've gone to Paris. She's a fine looking woman, your sister. May I? Oh. Surely, madame, quite a peach. CHUCKLES: Oh! Really, you can't do anything in this town without someone knowing it. Who took it? I don't know, do you? What are you doing here? As you know, I can turn up in the most unexpected places. How do you know she's my sister? Huh? In fact, you're my sister, too. By law. What do you mean? You are my sister-in-law and I'm your brother-in-law, because your sister is my wife. Julie, your wife? So you knew about me all the time and you didn't say anything. It was difficult. What could I do? You were calling yourself Marianne and wished, it seemed, to be anonymous. And who told you my name is Marianne? Huh?! Must have been Jack. And what's Jack? Part of the fucking room service?! He's of absolutely no importance. And I suppose Jack knows Julie, too, does he? You're joking! Jack and Julie, they are as thick as thieves. How very bloody cosy. I've been running round like a headless chicken, and no-one did anything! You must have been pissing yourselves laughing! You are wrong. INAUDIBLE SPEECH KLAXON HONKS No! Leave me alone. Listen! Why should I listen to you? Huh? Don't be scared. Look, after all you've told me, how can I trust any of you? I didn't want to upset you. I mean, you and I are the only ones who can work out this story. That's the point. We are in the same boat. And we are in trouble, both. HE SPEAKS IN FRENCH Bitte. THEY SPEAK GERMAN Do you remember? In 24 hours. Hm? That same Chinaman. May I take your case? Who sent you to the hotel? Was it Jack's idea? What does it matter? But you knew I was running away. Nobody else did. Because they don't read. Jack wouldn't pick up a newspaper if his life depended on it. SHE SCOFFS, HE CHUCKLES It's quite simple. Your picture is in the English papers. THEY LAUGH What are your immediate plans? I'm waiting to see your wife. Tonight. Come with me and we'll see her now. There's a party at her villa, should you brave the return of my driving licence. JULIE: Did you try the hotel? She checked out. You've no idea where she might be? You look smart. - How are your eyes? - Better. I have to have an operation, but the doctors are quite hopeful. I don't think I could stand with losing my sight. I'd rather be deaf or dumb. In a strange way, I've come to accept it. I can't afford to go on much longer. I can lend you money. No, no, you don't understand. I'm almost bankrupt. Is it true what Jack says, that you're a gangster? HE CHUCKLES I prefer to see myself as a magician. A magician? Yes. I make things disappear or happen. It's a speciality. What kind of things? Almost anything you care to mention. What about that building, or all of that? You have to be in another part of the world for that now. In certain places, I believe it's still possible to make whole cities vanish. I prefer to be more subtle, more intimate. Sleight-of-hand. So... It's not that easy to make things disappear. It requires a certain knack. You have to practise or you lose the art. But you see, ma petite fée, there is little magic left in the world now. And can you make people disappear? Too much concrete. CHUCKLES: Much too crude. No, I mean disappear and turn up in different places. Oh, that's different. Excuse me, I misunderstood. Difficult, not impossible. It requires a lot of skill. Do you know someone? A friend, perhaps? A friend, perhaps. A good friend? It depends, sometimes. HE CHUCKLES Your friend will need... ...a lot of nerve and money. How much money? WHISPERS: 30,000. Your friend hasn't got that much? Has your friend anything else to offer? The hands. Such extraordinary instruments. Far more revealing than faces, if you know how to read them. Can you read hands? No. THEY LAUGH I can try. What do you see? A journey, perhaps? I thought you said we're going to a party. JULIE: Oh, Susannah, the uninvited guest. I ran into Edouard. - Did you? - Hm. He seems to have taken quite a shine to you. I didn't know he was your husband. Well, I don't advertise the fact. Pardon. Thank you. You look great. Where did you get that outfit? Edouard gave it to me. Oh. That's where my clothes disappear to. You don't have any evidence that he wears them? It wouldn't surprise me. Edouard. By the way, Nicholas is here. I couldn't get rid of him... Where is he? Upstairs resting. He says he doesn't feel much like a party. But no arguments, please. Not today. The South of France is a completely different country, apparently. I didn't know that. Everyone dresses topless down there, even in the streets and in the banks. They have pictures. In the charts? No, in the South of France! Susannah, you know Jack. He's our Man Friday. He only works on Fridays. The rest of the time, he's fucking about behind our backs. - Hello. - Hello. Fancy you knowing Julie. You're the exotic one from overseas, aren't you, Julie? We're talking about letting him go because we haven't been getting so much value from him... ...lately. And frankly, we're less satisfied with his performance. In or out of bed. Oh, I don't know. I think Jack's a big enough prick by any standards. Aren't you, Jack? I haven't finished. Julie, what's the matter? You know what you remind me of, Jack? One of those deep-sea angler fish, you know the ones? The male's only this long, with no eyes, just a mouth. The females are big, terrifying creatures who can swell up, with rods on their heads and lights on the end to attract their prey. The male's only this big, and they attach themselves in rows to the underside of females. They become part of the bloodstream. They don't have any heads, just a sucker to hang on with. In fact, they have no independent life of their own. Just like you! Jack, I've got to go. Excuse me, ma chérie. What can I do for you? Could you put on the uniform? Just for today. HE LAUGHS No... Nicholas... HE SNORES SOFTLY DOOR SLAMS What's the matter? I'm fed up with all of them! See you. Do you still want to disappear? I've arranged everything. You don't make people disappear, you consume them. You buy and sell things like anyone else. Thanks, I'm not for sale. I want you more than anything in my life. Any thing? Edouard, tactless, really. What about all of this? It doesn't even belong to me. And Julie? Oh. I married her for a German passport. Anyway, she's beyond help. Incurable. - Incurable? - You can't go home again. Incurable? We can go where you want. What do you mean incurable? She's an addict. She has a habit. Friends. Do you know what your husband's been telling me? That you're an incurable addict, and he's asking me to go away with him. SHE LAUGHS My husband is perfect in every way but one. He's an incurable liar, and I doubt very much if it's you that he wants to take. It's that boy who drives his car. Have you seen Susannah? Oh, no. Marianne to you. Remember Eddie? Roll with punches. Jesus! What did you do that for? HE COUGHS Did I hurt you? No. So, what do you think of my other life? I know. One day I'll get tired of all this. It's just a matter of leaving. Are you coming? No. I can't. SHOUTS: Susannah! Susannah! Susannah! Susannah! Susannah! Jack! Susannah! NICHOLAS SOBS CLANG! You're free to go. Is that all? Isn't that enough? I can really go? Nobody's stopping you. 'Tomorrow I will walk through the city. 'I will be completely without fear. 'Everything will be unexpected. 'I shall keep a moving target.' NICHOLAS: I'll find her one day. Maybe not this month or the next, but one day. Perhaps after I've stopped hoping. There she'll be, sitting in a café or crossing the street. I've rehearsed this moment so many times in my mind... ...that when it happens there'll be nothing to say.
