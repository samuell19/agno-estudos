So. Henry is Norris' best friend, all right? One day, he goes over to Norris' house, Norris' wife, Andrea, answers the door. Says "Hey, how you doin'? "Norris isn't home right now." He says, "Hey, how you doin'?" And proceeds to take out $1000 cash. He says to Andrea, "I always liked you. "How about I give you this $1000 in cash, "and we go upstairs before the man comes in." Andrea, now she's looking at this $1000. Just like most of us, she could use that cash. So they go upstairs. 10, 15 minutes later they come back down. Well, two hours or so, Norris comes back home. Says, "Hey baby, how you doin'? "Henry come by here today?" Now, this catches Andrea off guard. She's a little shaken. "Yeah, he was here earlier." Norris says, "Good, he was bringing me "that $1000 he owes me." Wisper, you're really fucked up, man. Ain't nothin' but a joke. Oh god, hello there, J. Chanel Four News.

Happy birthday! Birthday, yeah. Happy birthday, Jenine. We're all so proud of you. That was a lovely speech you gave. Josiah could not have asked for a better daughter. I am so proud of my grandbaby. This is one of the proudest days I have had. I can't wait to see what she's gonna become. Happy birthday, Jenine. We love you so much. Sorry I'm late. Congratulations on your birthday. Josiah couldn't have asked for a better daughter. Well he could have asked. Hey date, love you. You wanna share some of that cake?

I'm sorry you missed it. Yeah. I really doubt that. Are you gonna play that thing all night? Excuse me? The camera. Ah, the camera. Yeah, the camera. No I wasn't planning on it. Hmm, what's this over here? I want you to leave the drink and bring your cannoli. Uh huh, uh huh, mhmm. Mmm-mmm, let me get that. That's right, Lieutenant. About 250, black as a struck match. Just started dealing. Find him at 134th and Lennox. Keep me posted, I'll do the same. Hup, eight o'clock, Laura. Let's check back at Oasis then head to Jersey. I wanna surprise Alisa. Call you up in half an hour, right? Yeah, no problem, J. Let's go. Willy, small brother. Aight. Come on, let's go. Hello New Jersey. Shit. Damn Alisa, how many times I have to tell you not to turn off the porch lights? J? I have no idea what's going on here but do not stop shooting. What the fuck is going on here? How many kids do you have? Three. And how old were they? Wisper! How old were your kids?! Penny's 16. And Jenine, she just turned 18. My little boy, Michael was just five. Hey, what is that for? It's fine, officer. She's just helping me out. Laura, stay on. Surveillance can help, it's a small town. Cameras everywhere these days. Breaker's squeak as a clear for prints. Forensic's in the other two rooms. How we doing in here? Single shot to the head. She never felt a thing. Hey, you okay? This kid loved ballet. My Casey does too. Hey. Yeah? You gonna take off tomorrow. Yeah, go spend some time with your kids, go. No, no, I'm fine, sir. No, no, no, it's not a suggestion. Not a suggestion, come on. I own a gun. 38 revolver. I have a CCW for it. Yeah, the one in the kitchen, we have it. It's never been fired. We know. You have a license to carry that around, huh? Any other weapons we should know about? No. Sir, I'm Detective Cardelli. Will you come back to the station with us? We have some more questions to ask you. It's routine. Yeah take him back now. It's fine, I got it. Carlisle! Hey, Cardelli. What's the situation? Mom and two of the kids are bagged, ready to go. Thompson's working on the little ballerina right now but guy's going all chick flick up there. Come on, a little respect, please! Listen soon as Wisper hits tail lights tell them to start bringing the bodies down. It's about time. Nice and discreet. I'm sorry, I'll have them go ninja mode for you. Really? Whoah, media stays outside. But I'm not media. I don't care who you are, you're not getting in here. This is just an informal interview. This is Detective Archer. This is Detective Conlin from the Prosecutor's Department. Oh, and Detective Thompson. It's a big crowd in here for an informal interview. This is just routine procedure, strictly voluntary. However, we do appreciate your willingness to cooperate. Look, Josiah, we're sorry about what happened to your family. We know this won't be easy for you. We'll be as gentle with you as possible. 12:39 a.m., Wednesday June 8th, 2016, interview with Josiah Wisper. You run the Lion's Den Bar in Harlem? I own the Lion's Den. I also own the Oasis Bar, three apartment buildings and a card store. Card store? Stationery. I sell stationery. A silent partner. Do you have any trouble with any of those? Mostly the buildings. What kind of trouble? Poor regulations, but I still make money. See your family earlier today? No. Just yesterday. I brought some stuff in from the city in the afternoon. And that was the last time you saw your entire family before tonight? That's what I said. Any domestic problems, Josiah? Just the rent boy. With your family? No. Marriage okay? Sure. Kids have any problems at school, neighbors? We're just a happy suburban family. And yet you bought a home at a predominantly white neighborhood. Purple neighborhood was all filled up. What's your point, Detective? Look, you're legally allowed to carry a sidearm in this state and we have it with us for safekeeping. Now Josiah, are there any other firearms that you didn't mention to us about, you know, maybe it slipped your mind earlier tonight. Just the one I legally carry. It was handed over to your department out of my own free will. I thought you said this was just an informal interview. That's correct. A crowd of neighbors have quickly gathered outside the house where this terrible tragedy took place only a short time ago. Okay if I ask you a few questions, Mrs? Kowalski, Irene Kowalski. Thank you Mrs. Kowalski. Mrs. Kowalski, how long have you known your neighbors across the street? Oh I don't know them really. They only moved in about a year ago. Are you surprised about something like this happening here? No, not really. Josiah, you get along with your wife's family? She just got a sister, Norma. Real pain in the ass, but she's family so I don't have much choice in the matter. What about your family? I've got an older brother Curtis, he's okay. And Momma, she's still alive. Your momma still alive? No. What'd you do after you left your home Monday afternoon? My usual routine. I drove into Harlem and made the rounds of my businesses. And yeah I called Alisa later, went straight to voicemail. Didn't think that was a problem? She was a busy woman with her own things to do. Continue please. Not much else. Caught up on paperwork and went back to the Oasis. After I dropped off Laura I went to meet up with Melonie at her place. Who's Melonie? Melonie Burton. She manages for me sometimes. We had to go over some estimates for repairs. She also helps me with my outside appointments. And? It was late. I didn't feel like driving back to Jersey so I crashed at Melonie's place. Then in the morning, I went to meet with my accountant. What else? Went back to Lion's Den, did some more paperwork, collected some rent at one of my buildings. Went back to Lion's, I worked a few more hours then drove home to Jersey. With a gift for your wife. I buy things for her from time to time. Just what is your relation to Miss Barton? Burton. She's an employee, I told you. She manages Oasis Bar. Did you go out with her socially? We're friends. Friends? Yes. Are you having an affair with her? We've had our times. Your wife was aware of that? Alisa knows. She knew. Was she concerned about it? Was she concerned about anything at all? Yeah, she wanted me to get out of the bar business. Why was that? The late nights, long hours. She thought it was dangerous. She worried about me. She wasn't worried about you fucking other women? She knew me before we were married. Is Miss Barton, Miss Burton, is she the first one you had an affair with? No. You sleeping around didn't bother your wife at all? No. Josiah, maybe if you'd been home last night instead of out fucking one of your friends, maybe we wouldn't be here right now. Did you ever consider that? I know. How do you think I feel? You just don't act like a man who just lost his entire family, that's all. Really? Really. How's a man who just lost his family supposed to act? Look, we wanna talk with you some more, Josiah. Where will you be the next few days? I'd probably be staying at my momma's house. All right, we understand. Just leave the number and the address with Detective Thompson. We'll get in touch. All right, Wisper, we're heading out back. Don't want the press to make mincemeat out of you just yet. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on, please. I shot a little more at the house. How did it go in there? They said it was an informal investigation, that's cop talk for intimidation. Ah, fuck! Something ain't right. This was a hit. I could feel it. They killed my family. They wanna make me suffer. What are we gonna do, J? I don't know. But I know they're coming for me next. I'm not gonna let them do it. From now on, we're gonna get everything. Whatever you say, J, I'm with you. Okay, we're here. My whole family, gone. How could this happen? It was so hopeless, Mom. Have one of these, little brother. It'll cure anything. What happened, man? I don't know. I got home. And I found the kids. And then I found Alisa. I just can't understand why. We just have to pray on it, baby. I know you must be hungry. Let me fix you something to eat. No, not hungry, momma. I'm good with this one. They think I did it. They're not saying it outright but that's what they're getting to. You know how these people are, specially the white ones. Curtis. Well it's true. I didn't do it. I didn't do nothing. I don't even know what I didn't do. Too bad you weren't recording when it happened. A nine year old Metro girl has a new lease on life thanks to surgery at the, There were no signs of a forced entry and no evidence of a robbery. Apparently the assailant was known by the family. However, one source indicated to this reporter that there are many questions about Wisper. His quick rise from poor ghetto beginnings to a well-to-do businessman owning several bars and a $650,000 home. I don't believe it. Our sources also indicated that Wisper may be involved in illegal lobbying, influence peddling and possibly even drug trafficking. That's your answer? You hear this shit? Josiah don't work with the man. I can't. You blind motherfuckers, man! - Josiah. - Blind ass motherfuckers. Josiah James Wisper, get your butt back in here! Here you are, brother. That must be Reverend Henning. Shit. I know you don't wanna think about these things right now son, but they have to be done. No. I don't need some pious Jesus freak wanting to save my soul from everlasting life of fucking sin or whatever. I've been known to do a prayer like that on a few auspicious occasions, brother, but, it isn't why your mother asked me by today. Son, this is Reverend Henning. Apologize, Reverend. The luminous at my church. Can I get you something to drink, Reverend? Lemonade, iced tea, coffee? No, no, no, no, thank you ma'am. You know what, I'll just have the same as these men here. I'm sorry. Does that thing have to be on? Yes. And, You must be Josiah. That's me, Reverend. This is my big brother Curtis. Josiah. I'll get that drink. Hey. I'm very sorry about your family. Your mother's already told me quite a bit. And I understand your feelings. I don't think anyone can right now, Reverend. It's true, you know. No one ever can, right? May I call you Josiah? You already did. Everybody calls me J. J. J, look. J, I've never found it easy. I've never found it easy to help someone at a time like this. So I won't pretend. But some decisions, some decisions have to be made. And I'm here to help you as much as possible. I appreciate that, Reverend. I do want my family to have a proper funeral. But I don't want crying and amens and any other tearjerking crap. Just something dignified and quiet and for momma and our friends. I hear you. Thank you, Curtis. I hear you. A77, turn here. You okay, momma? Curtis, Curtis. You all right? I'm fine. Here it is. You're okay? Thanks. So sorry. - Thanks. - God bless you. Keep it moving. Deepest sympathy, I'm very sorry. Thanks. I'm so sorry. You go ahead in line, there's enough there. Got it. Watch yourself, J. Sunday, June 12th 2016, 3:25 p.m. Three lives and you swear them, that's the kind of relation? Really, motherfucker? He didn't say that. He didn't say that to me. J's good people. He's always been good to me. But like I said, he's the boss. Do you understand? Yeah. So last night he rolled up in here. He's beat, started tasting the bottle. Said he was going home, asked me to close up. I close up on him. Willy. We're in New York City jurisdiction now. Detective Cardelli is here courtesy of my commanding officer. And my partner, he's attending the funeral. So we appreciate your cooperation but we both have more questions. Shoot. Willy, did you ever see your boss with a small gun, like a pocket pistol? Let's see. J had a 38. Called it his sister. If he was carrying a lot of money on him, he's walking with his sister. He intended on keeping his money. Willy, have you yourself been in trouble with the law? Kids stuff. Yeah? Shit kids get into trouble for. All kids get into trouble before they graduate from high school. Like? Stealing a car. You know, taking something from the five and dime, no real shit. You know, we can check records. Do what you need to do. I got someplace else I need to be. Appreciate you helping me out on this. Look, I owe you for Bergman. TV lights are gonna spread out on both sides of the river on this one. It can be a boost for both of us instead of drowning in the usual flood of shit. Just one thing though. Wisper's still paranoid. Like there's someone still out there trying to finish the job. Is it real? Has to be. This whole neighborhood is paranoid. Look, time will tell. I'll be in touch. You bet, I hope so. You could turn this fucking thing off now. June 20th, 2016, 10:25 a.m. Second interview with Josiah Wisper. Thanks for coming in again. Before we begin, I wanna ask you are you sure you wanna appear here without an attorney? I'm sure. Can you tell me more about that night with Miss Burton? Sure. The night you spent with Miss Burton, were you in each other's company the entire night? Yes. Sure you didn't leave her side maybe when she fell asleep? I'm sure. Did you stop by your home on your way to Miss Burton? No, I told you. And your wife knew where you were? Because of the nature of my business and the hours I keep, sometimes I stay in the city, sometimes with friends. And that didn't concern her at all? No. Except when it would cause me to miss one of my kids' school events. Sorry guys. Paperwork. We were just discussing your wife's reaction to you staying out of town overnight. Yeah, you guys argue about that sort of thing? You know, about you staying out all night? I told you. For the most part, Alisa was cool with that side of my life. Must have been some sort of superwoman, right? To have your wife be okay with your nighttime proclivities. We should bring her in here and probably ask her. Oh wait we can't, 'cause she's dead. Go fuck yourself, Detective. Look, Josiah, we appreciate you coming in. We're just trying to sort this out, find the pieces that fit. Okay some of this may sound outlandish to you but I assure you it's necessary. Okay, New York's doing their part in Harlem. We are gonna solve this case. I hope so. Oh we will. We're gonna talk some more to you and everyone else involved. We're gonna turn this thing inside out until we learn the truth, okay? So I hope you've been truthful with us, Josiah. And if not, I suggest you start being straight with me, do you understand? I hear you. I'm standing here with Debra Casale. Miss Casale, did you know the Wispers well? I really didn't know them that well. He was always with that camera taping his children and such. He taped me too. Did you have any concerns with a bar owner and potential drug dealer living next to you and your family? - Well. - Shut it off. - I was a little concerned. - Not you. Brother. We never imagined he could be a drug dealer. I mean this is a nice neighborhood, I never thought they would hurt us. Can you go up the city tomorrow? - You okay? - Sure, what you got? Uh huh. Cops wanna talk to Melonie and I need you to be there to get it. How'd you swing that? You're not a suspect and we're hiding the camera. This is her address. They'll be there at two. I'll be there at one. There's some other people you wanna get but we'll get to that later. Is the gun still in safekeeping? I'll be scarce. Won't be needing it. All right , let's get to it. Nice couch. You sure this is gonna help J? It can't hurt. He's starting to relax a little bit so we should really try to take advantage. Don't look at the camera. Looking at it or even toward it is gonna attract attention, okay? Yeah, okay. Come in and have a seat. Can I get you some coffee, Detective? Or a drink? - No thanks. - I'll take some coffee. Never mind. No thank you, Miss Burton. Presumably it is Miss? It'll do. I'm divorced. Miss Burton, I would like to ask you some questions about the night that you were with Josiah. Go ahead. Now Miss Burton, you and Josiah came here directly from his child's birthday party. Now he didn't happen to leave this house to go anywhere for say, I don't know a nightcap or a cup of coffee? Or a stop in Jersey to kill his family? I didn't say that. I know what you meant, Detective Rothstein. Sorry, Rothstein. No, he came straight here from the party. He came in, stopped at the front door, hung out here in the living room and then we went straight to bed and I fucked his brains out. Is that what you wanted to know? We had breakfast in the morning and then he left. It was about what, nine o'clock. He had a 10 o'clock meeting with his accountant. And neither of you left here at all during the night, together or separately? No. How many times do I have to tell you that, no. You know, you give him a very strong alibi. Do you think he needs one? No, not in the least. Gives you a strong one too. What? Makes me wonder if you need one. Why? Is there a law against fucking? I hope you had a good fourth. I see you cleaned the place up a bit. Been here before? You know if you feel more comfortable, we can go... No come on, let's get this over with. All right. About your sister Alisa, what's your relationship? I mean we wasn't exactly alike, as you can see. She's the more successful one, always driven to rise above it all. And she did too. And look where it got her. So you and Alisa, very close? I mean we was close enough as sisters could be but we did our own thing too. When was the last time you saw her? When he brought that video ho to the house. So no time between in, Look. I got a life too, I can't be worried about everybody else! One of the neighbors spotted you June 5th. God. Lord they nobody but their damn nosy ass Italian bitch Mrs. Casale. Yeah I was there. I needed to see Alisa. I went over there that morning but nobody was home. Well what about? Damn, you all in my business. I needed to borrow some money. So did you borrow money from the Wispers very often? Not the Wispers, Alisa. She always looked out for me and slid me a little something. But Wisper? He don't give a damn about nobody but his damn self. So you don't get along with Josiah? Look, junior Detective. I can get along with anybody. But Wisper? He always looking down on me like I'm trash or something. When he this close to being trash himself. Like what kind of grown ass man walks around with a camera following him all the time like he about to be on the news or something? He's reckless. And I bet you he filmed his affairs too. But Alisa? Alisa got a heart. She always looked out for me and for her friends. Man, we done here? Yeah. Don't call me back down here no more. You ready, Kenny? Yup. Tuesday July 12th, 2016, 2:35 p.m. Clara, Josiah asked me to canvas the neighborhood to just document some thoughts and comments, anything you feel like sharing, you know. Anything. I remember the detectives told me I shouldn't talk to anyone. He meant the news people. He did mention them. The last time you saw Alisa? It was two days before it happened. How was she, like her normal self? No she wasn't. She was very upset. Her husband being in the city so much, that upset her a lot. But on that day, she was much worse. How? She used to say that these things bother her. She mean her husband? We used to meet up and talk. On that particular day, I just don't know how to say this. Take your time Clara, it's okay. I remember telling her that she has to go with the flow and not to let things bother her so much. And then she said there were times. Times when? How she wondered how it would be if her husband would come back home to a empty house. I gotta go. If her husband would come back home to an empty house. Yeah, she'd threatened to take the kids away from me. Run off to her mom's and Norma's. There's nowhere she can go that I wouldn't find them. It was Alisa just mouthing off. Follow me. You sure you won't reconsider? I'll make some things happen and Oasis is yours. Thanks J, but it's better this way. They're gonna find out the truth and this will all be over. But people will always be people. Do you want me to say this, hmm? They will always remember that I was your alibi and the Oasis, that was my reward. No, I'm sorry. That's not the truth. Yeah, whatever. Whatever? Nothing. It's that night, isn't it? You were gone for a long time! Baby, I told you, it's something I ate was tearing up my guts. I had to find a drugstore. But I lied about it, okay? What if they find out? They will not find out! I was looking for a damn drugstore! Look, I know where I was. Where were you? You're staying around, aren't you? I'm going to my sister's upstate. But, No, it's got to be this way, all right? Look, we had some good times. But it's over now. You let me down, J. I'll miss you. No you won't, please. You don't miss anybody. Shut it off. Shut it off! There he is. July 20th 2016, 8:43 or so. Hey It's early. Still shooting, I see, yeah. Where's your pretty camera girl? Just me, Reverend. Yeah? Not fond of the gym? Oh, I like the fresh air. You should get up participate once in a while. I think I'm participating enough right now, thanks. Well look, thanks for meeting me. So tell me, how's it been going? Good, good. Son of a bitch is finally letting me take a lie detector test. Yeah, and? All good. J, J, that's great. Now I just need to get them to believe me. There might be a way. All right, I've got an idea. Maybe a way. Yeah, sure. You find the tall building, I climb to the top of it and scream at the top of my lungs, "I didn't fucking do it!" Ah yeah, something like that. But look. I'm gonna be honest with you, there aren't many miracles left anymore. But I might have found one. A friend of mine runs a radio station. You could bring that camera. Sound good? Reverend, at this point, I'm willing to try anything. Bless you, brother, have a good day. - Thanks. - Okay. You too. Hey, J, my brother. Hey, Reverend Henning. Thanks for coming. Thanks for setting this up, man. - Absolutely. - Appreciate it. Hi, I'm Caroline, the production manager. - How you doing? - Nice to meet you. Josiah Wisper. - Nice to meet you. - Reverend Henning, pleasure. Pleasure. Right this way. Thanks for having me here. Welcome. So Caroline, how long you been working here? About six months. Oh nice. Yeah. Laura, she's my camera person. She's kinda documenting everything. Do you mind if she comes here with us? It's best she doesn't come in. Sure, do you mind if I have her just stay outside right here? - Sure that's fine. - Okay. All right just set up right there, make sure you stay on me, get all this, okay? Okay. All right, in here? Yeah, right in here. Hi, Timolyn. Pleasure, Josiah Wisper. - Thanks for having me. - Pleasure. Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me on your show. Sure, just sit right here. Right here? Reverend Henning, pleasure. Nice to meet you too. I've never been in one of these before. I'm a little nervous. It's not so bad. Good morning and welcome to Urban Report. I am Timolyn Moore and I'll be your host for the next hour. This morning we have a very distinguished guest with us, Mr. Josiah Wisper. May I call you Josiah? Josiah, you will recall is a very successful Harlem tavern owner who returned home recently to find his wife and children brutally murdered, all shot dead by a mysterious unknown assailant. First, Josiah, welcome. Thanks. Thank you very much for joining us on our show. Thank you for having me. Josiah, I'd like to start out by asking a question that's on everyone's mind. Did you murder your family? J, hold on, hold on, hold on. Come on, come on, come on. Look, I'm really sorry about that. I wasn't expecting her to say that, I'm sorry. Sorry, she's not her sensitive self today. Yeah, but I'm used to it now. Look, it's not your fault, I'll call you. Come on, let's just get out of here. It's a waste of my fucking time. We're trying very hard. You ain't helping much. I've put up a $5,000 reward. I know. But everything's a dead end. Look, we know you passed the polygraph but we still can't prove where you was at that night. Now it's too bad you weren't recording yourself. I've told you a dozen times. And the lady backed you up. What's the problem? You're backing each other up. It's not like you have a witness. We weren't into threesomes. Let's talk about drugs. Harlem's busted a lot of drugs in your bar. That's a major dent in illicit revenue. I hope so. I busted my ass tipping off the authorities too. Whoah, whoah, whoah, wait, wait, wait. You helped the department on those arrests? They never told you? What have we got here, two separate investigations? Y'all don't talk to each other? What happens, whoever solves the Wisper murder gets a big fucking medal? All right, all right, it's just something we weren't informed of. Christ, I could run this investigation better than both of your departments. Don't even think about meddling. Thank you, but any information I find out in regards to my family's murder, I don't consider meddling. Just don't interfere. Interfere? As long as we've got two police departments acting like two separate countries, why shouldn't I interfere? That reward is the only constructive thing going on in this case. You get your shit together or by damn I will interfere. I want these murders solved, I want them solved! So do we, Josiah. So do we! Then do it. Let's see what they have this time. All right, come on. You know where Josiah is? In the back. Bravo gentlemen, you finally talk to each other. Come on in. That drug thing was a communication problem. We apologize. Right. Can we sit? Please, by all means. As you see we're not exactly at full capacity. I got your message, how'd it go? How did what go? The setup, the sting. Oh yeah it was a week ago, last Wednesday. Yeah, we heard it was Number Uno, or one of his dealers that did your family for the problems you caused them. Yeah, I know that. Yeah we did it at Sweet's Tavern. Yeah we did it at Sweet's Tavern near Broadway, okay? We had to catch him in something so we knew he wasn't at the New York Place. So why didn't you just bring him in? He had to do something first. Look, Josiah, we're here as a courtesy, you know that? So the word on the street was that he did it or he ordered it and knew the guy who did it. So we set him up with a informant who was wired. He was to walk in and you know, start a conversation, get him to talk and hopefully he'll implicate himself on tape. We paid this informant $6,000 cash. So what's your point? He walked in the front door of the bar and walked out the back door, ripped off the wire and ran away. You know this guy who did, the snitch, right? He's gone Josiah, he's gone. We don't know where he is. Uno's gone too. What are you thinking? I'm thinking if somebody gave you guys a bag of five dollar bills to hand out on the corner, you'd find a way to fuck it up. Glad you're all so intent. I want my gun back. Your what? My gun. I want my gun back. I'm no longer a suspect, as you said and you've had more than enough time to check it out. I know, I know you're right, it's clean. Cardelli. That is my gun. I'm legally licensed to carry it. I use it for my protection from whoever did this to my family, from Uno, even from you. Hah, from us? Hah, really? Really. Rothstein. Why do you think my people are still around after the haters been trying to get us for hundreds of years? 'Cause we're forgiving? No. It's because we're packing. Maybe there'd be a lot more of your people, Rothstein if the Jews in Germany had acted a little bit less like Jews and a little bit more like Israelis. I want my gun back. - I want it back! - How dare you. Get the fuck out of my bar, you're done. These gentlemen are done here, Willy. September 12th 2016, 4:26 p.m. Lil Bro, you sure know how to find fucking trouble. Ain't like I look for it. So where were you for the past two days? You boys want some coffee? Don't take but a minute to fix a fresh pot. No. No thanks, momma. You sure? Nah, I'm okay. If you change your mind, I'm right here. Okay. Does she have to fuckin be here? She's getting everything I do. You didn't answer my question. Everything? That's bullshit. The bullshit's why she's here. What do you mean by that, huh? She's setting the record straight. If you kept everything straight, you wouldn't need no camera taking it. Curtis, why you always busting my ass about something? Why you pissed off, huh? What is it that piss you? Is it because I'm successful? That I got a beautiful home in Jersey or I got a little piece on the side? Where were you for the last two days? I'll tell you. When you turn off the camera, I'll tell you. Okay, I went upstate. I had to get away. Stop looking at me like that. For Christ's sakes, Josiah. You had a good wife and family. Why'd you step on them like that all the time? That's really fucking up. Fucking up huh? Fucking up? At least I had a family and I took damn good care of 'em. How many you ran through, what, you been with one, two, three wives? With your holy shit on Sunday and your face in a barrel of scotch the rest of the week? I know Cardelli wanted to speak to you and you wanted to speak to him. So where the fuck did you go? What the difference between me and you, is when you stepped out, you got your wife killed, my two nieces, my nephew. Bravo, bravo, - big brother. - No. - You fuckup. - Would you stop that racket right now, hear me? Right now! Momma. It's already made. Might as well have some. Lordy! I tried to bring up two good boys. Lord knows I did. And look at both of you. You never grew up to be good men. You Curtis, drinking your way through two good women! And you Josiah, shaming your family the way you done, what is wrong with the two of you?! I just buried my grandbabies and the two of you are bickering like five year olds! It's time to grow up! Enough, enough, enough. All right. September 16, 2016, seven p.m. Melonie's sister's house. Stay hidden. Sure. What? What? Why, J, what are you doing here? I was wondering how you was doing. Guess I'm doing okay. Really nice out here. Look, I was doing something, all right? Please, it's cold out here. We're not done. J, what do you want? That night, when I went out to the drugstore, remember? Yeah. When I got back, you were gone. Where'd you go? Out to do some killing, hmm? Don't look around. Ain't nobody to help. That what you did? No, no, I didn't do nothing like that. Look I didn't go do no killing. Okay. And? I had the same thing happen as you did. And you were gone. I had to go out and get something and I was almost out of gas. That's why it took so long. Then why didn't you say so? 'Cause I was your alibi. And if I wasn't there, well, then I couldn't tell anyone. But they had you already. J, what happened to the girl at the drugstore? She could vouch for you. I told you, when I went back, they said she quit, she was gone! Look. As soon as I solve this, I will make it up to you. I'm sorry I got you involved. Goodbye. September 21st, 2016, 5:33 p.m. You're pretty good at that. I'm good at a lot of things. Hustling pool got me through college. Took a lot of balls to get my Master's before I was able to get on my feet. Want a beer? I'm on duty. Not in this state you're not. I'm still on duty. So all this started out as a hobby? Pretty much. Until I could quit. So what brings you back? Rusty. Haven't heard you made any arrests yet. Nope. You need some pretty solid evidence for that. And we don't have it. So Uno gets off? Maybe I should take care of him myself. Don't even go there, J. So what do you have? A theory. Theory? A theory won't buy you crap. Oh it's a believable one. We just can't prove it. For Christ's sakes Cardelli, all this time and all you got is a theory that you can't even prove? J, the bullets were from a 32 caliber pistol. Yeah it's a light round. But a well placed shot can put a grown man out. Now we figured the shooting took place in the dead of night, walls cut out most of the sound, neighbors slept through the whole thing. Now ballistics match our hunch. Now there was no one outside your house that night, no activity whatsoever. No people, no cars. And we interviewed a bunch of your neighbors and we were really surprised at the amount of information we got. Not surprising, the neighbors always poking around. Well, with all that and the crime scene evidence, what happened that night originated and was contained inside that house. How? It was an inside job, Wisper. So now you're back to me. I told you... Not you. No, Alisa? And then turned the gun on herself at the end. Powder residue on her right hand backs up that theory. No, Alisa, she didn't own no gun. Yeah you know, it's a felony to own an unlicensed firearm in New Jersey, but come on, if she wanted to get one. There was no gun at the sink. And that's where it all falls apart. No gun, no case. But how? They had a key. No, no, no, nobody had a key. Except Norma. Nope. We can't prove that either. Some church ladies vouched for her. They said that she was with them overnight at some kind of gathering. It's hard to believe. Yeah, it's the only one that fits. And one other thing. You are no longer a person of interest, officially. So now you believe what I told you in the first place. Unfortunately, yes. Unfortunately? You know, I just wish we could have had a camera set up that night the way you got your camera. Case closed. But that's just a fantasy. What? I will be in touch with you shortly. Let's go, come on. Ready J. All right, let's see what we got. Okay. What do we got here? All right, what do you see? What? Oh god. What, what? No. Oh god. Oh my god. No! No, no! Why would you, it's our kids! Fuck, no! Manny, Manny, Manny. Josiah, slow down. If the camera bothers him, shut it off when I tell you, don't. I want to hear what he has to say. Got it. Manny, Manny! J, it's been a while. Yes it has, Manny, yes it has. Sorry about your family, man. What's that for? It's a little side project I got going on. Do you mind? No, I don't mind. Is that what brings you here? Partly, I need a piece. Flavor? Small enough to hick, large enough to kill. Right over here. Nine mill. It has a good feel. You can use that at home, for defense. Bedside table. Felt good. Hard to tell the difference. Nothing but the best, baby. I see. You got anybody in here trying to unload a piece recently? All the time, man. But I only get the quality. Something small, fits in a purse, handbag. Something a chick would use. I don't know. I get all kinds of sellers. Look at me, Manny. Shut if off, Laura. Okay. Answer me. We've been friends a long time. Answer me, Manny. A while back I was closing up and some woman come in wanting to unload a piece. Said she needed some money. She offered it up just like you described. She didn't have no paperwork or nothing. Wanted cash up front. The thing is, What, Manny? I recognized that weapon. How? It was the gun I sold your wife. Man Alisa came in here one day worried out of her mind, said you're never home and she's getting threatening calls. Asked whether or not I'd help her. Discreetly. You sold her an unregistered gun? Man, we're from the streets. Law and order ain't exactly around every corner. This woman tried to sell the gun, what did she look like? I mean, I don't know. I ran her ass out of here. She took the gun with her. Didn't leave a name. That gun's untraceable, man, I left it at that. Nothing, you remember nothing? Man, my mind is shit. That's why I got these security cameras installed. I can play it back for you if you want. That'll help, right? Yes it would. Please. Goddamit, Norma. Norma, open up. Open up, Norma! Norma, how did you get that gun? I don't know what you're talking about. You know damn what the fuck I'm talking about. How did you get Alisa's gun? I told you, asshole. I fucking told you. Get your fucking house in order. No, no, no. You had that fucking gun. She knew about everything I was fucking doing from the fucking beginning. That don't mean that she fucking approved of that shit! I don't wanna hear that shit. How'd you get that gun? Did you take it from my house? Did you kill my fucking family? Yeah I got it from your damn house. You killed your fucking... Nah I didn't kill my fucking family, I went in there and it was laying in there next to her dead body on the kitchen floor! Now come on, let's go. I'm not going no fucking where with you! You're coming with me so we can straighten this shit out. I'm not telling nobody nothing. Besides, who gonna believe me anyway? Where'd you put the gun? Huh, you try to sell that shit, huh? God knows I need money. But I could never sell that gun. That was my sister, Wisper! You did that shit! You did that shit! You killed her. - Come on. - She may have pulled - that trigger, - Come on. But you did that shit, you killed your own fucking family! Fuck you Josiah, fuck you too, get the fuck outta here! It was all my fault. She could have just told me to stop. I didn't do nothing.
