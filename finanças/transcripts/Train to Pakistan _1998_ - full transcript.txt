Father! Jugga didn't turn bad. He was born to wickedness. I was a mere land records auditor, A lowly assistant to the district magistrate, when his father, Alam Singh, was hanged .. .. for murder, by the order of the great .. ..and merciful raj of George the Fifth, king Emperor. It was the first time I had seen a man hanged. Many years later, I was back in the district .. .. as the magistrate, second class. Juggut Singh by then had grown to be .. .. the known ruffian he was born to be. My informers brought us news, that he was fighting for the leadership of his .. .. father's old gang of bandits. Malli! ***! My Inspector sahib, of course, Gathered the bodies, and was quick to claim .. .. that his brave men had shot the bandits. It was good for the crime Statistics of my district. I was awarded a certificate and a cash prize, on behalf of the Governor of Punjab. A few dead bodies? All part of the game. It was the way of this small corner of the world. My district was happy with me, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus all. And I was happy with my district. O my beloved Come and meet me I long for you My friend is unlike any other. And is the one I love The Sustainer of all, how would He know? Nooran? who's there? No, Father. I think there must be rats in the grain bags. Use a stick, then. Don't worry, Father. They've gone over the wall. Open the door,***! There's no one here. Lalaji has gone to the city. what do you want? Everything! where is the man? He's gone to .. Then the boy goes too! He's upstairs. where's the key to the safe? I got it all out. I have nothing more. Take it all! You've nothing more? Lair! where's the key to the safe? I don't have a safe. Forgive me! Spare me! Tell me! - Forgive me! Save me! I've been robbed! I've been ruined! May your fortunes remain high! May your home be blessed with gold and silver .. .. and with many grandchildren. Let me have a look. Sir, you will be dazzled! I brought her up just to .. .. serve great men like you. I said, let me see her. - Yes, your honour. Greet the master properly. Get on with it. Now our eyes have met And you have stolen my heart Please do not go away Sir. - what is it? The Inspector is here with some people. what the hell is this? Sir, they came to the village and tried to lecture the people. what kind of lecture? what's this?.. You! Sir, they say these are the skulls of Muslims .. .. killed by Hindus in Bihar. They went to the mosque trying to incite people.. .. to begin slaughter here as well. You ***! You've come to my village to stir trouble? Get rid of this rubbish. Handcuff them and throw them Across the border into Pakistan. Listen, Mullah, my district is peaceful. No Muslim is killing any Sikh here. Nor is any Hindu killing any Muslim. If you step into my district again, I'll shoot you! Now get lost! Sir, what about the donkey? Cut it up and eat it. Stop this racket! Get out of here! Sing something to please him. Didn't you hear what I said? ***! Leave the girl behind. Juggia! Oh Juggia! Come out! Come wear these bangles, put henna and become the queen of dacoits! Or give it to the weaver's daughter on our behalf. why don't you sing like that? Because I'm not a man. Oh, quick to reply. I'm not afraid of you. It's just that she told me to do what you desire. She .. your mother? No, my grandmother. My mother died when I was born. How old are you? How should I know? Oh God! what am I doing? Go home. As you wish. But I was told to stay. For what? were you told? To do whatever men want me to do. Men? You do this with all men? No, I only sing and dance. I know nothing about the rest. But I know, you know everything. Come here. Sit closer. Sixteen.. .. seventeen maybe. Now, what the hell! Inspector sahib, sir. what is it? Sir, I'm sorry, but you forgot to sign the warrant .. .. to throw those skull people out of the country. warrant? Are you out of your mind, Inspector! Have you heard the news on the radio? Thousands of people are being killed all over India. Muslims slaughtering Sikhs and Hindus, and Sikhs killing Muslims! All madness! And you wake me up to sign a warrant for vagabonds. Come, let's move. Station-master, is there a place in this town where I can stay? Town? Perhaps you've got off at the wrong place. I suppose, you could stay at the Sikh temple. Anyone can stay there. I screamed and screamed, but no one came to help me. They killed him, they killed my husband .. .. and he helped all of you .. Yes, he certainly helped us at forty percent interest! what did you say? You'd kill a man for his profession? Oh, you ungrateful people, he was born to help you, to lend money to you. Oh God, now you've killed him! Take away the body. I swear by God, I don't know where Jugga is. Believe me, he has done nothing wrong. He has been going straight. Early morning he goes to the fields, Looks after the cattle all day. He doesn't even step out of the village. He reports to you daily. Go on, tell them! Jugga's father and grandfather were both known bandits, but they never robbed their own village. Oh, don't you remember, Biba, as long as they lived, no bandit dared step into Mano Majra. But Jugga .. this Jugga has disgraced his family. Robbing a fellow villager is like stealing from one's own mother. I tell you he didn't do anything .. I need a place to stay, for a few days. This is a Sikh temple, the Guru's house. It is open to all. There's your room. Are you a refugee? No, sir, I'm from Delhi. Oh! what's your name? Iqbal. Is there a telegraph office here? Not here. But there is a post-master in the next village. knows typing, too. Good. what brings you to Mano Majra? - well, I'm .. If you're here to sell something, you're wasting your time. I'm not a merchant. I'm a social worker. I see! My dear Inspector, times are bad. Any weakness on the part of the police, and antisocial elements will take advantage. Take care of the village and bring in the murderers! If the people get aroused .. the agitators.. refugees.. what are you waiting for? Go! Sir, please sir, my money, sir. Last night you Detained the girl, sir .. Get out of here! Bearer! Bearer! Bhaiji, how many refugees are there here? Here? None. No antagonism or trouble Between the Sikhs and Muslims? Sahib, what is it you really want to know? I don't understand. Bhaiji, I'm a social worker .. I want to stop the bloodshed, prevent killings. well in our village we are mostly Sikh. There are some Muslim brothers too, but, son, we all look after each other. No trouble of any sort? Trouble? Plenty of trouble! Murder! Dacoity! why only last night .. .. the village money-lender, Lala Ramlal, was murdered. Murdered! why? was it a question of religion? Bhaiji, is it safe for me to stay here? what! You came to stop the bloodshed .. .. and only one killing has got you scared? Don't worry, you're Perfectly safe in Mano Majra. Yes, I'm sure. Stop it! - Let me undo the knot. Oh God! You think of nothing else. when the fruit is ripe .. .. the bird is bound to peck. You are completely mad! Stupid peasant! Get away! But you still love me. I don't! I hate you! And you think I love you? You're a sorceress who has me entwined .. .. in her tresses. Jugga, I do like you a lot, but my father .. How will your father know I'm not a Muslim? what do you mean? My beauty, that we can be happy .. forever! Sir, what is your name? - Iqbal Are you coming from out of town? Yes, just passing through. Going to Pakistan? No! why would I go to Pakistan? I don't understand, what is all this talk about Pakistan? who created it? what do you think? why are the British leaving India a divided state? How would we know, sir? we are just poor peasants. But it is the labour of you Muslims and Sikhs .. .. that made this country. well, all the landlords in the village are Sikh. we are the labourers. All the Sikhs are landlords? Mostly. But we have never had any trouble. we Muslims-Sikhs are like brothers. Stop joking, Jugga. You are a Sikh. My father will never accept that. I'm neither a Sikh nor a Muslim, nor a Hindu. I'm a bandit, a free spirit without beliefs. I'm that wandering spirit.. .. who has nothing to do with any god. I belong to you, only you. Someone's coming! Seems like there's Trouble in the village. Trouble? what trouble? The money lender got killed by his debtors, so what's the big deal? The world still goes on! C'mon. Come here. Telegraph Babu! Yes? what's it? Can I send a telegram to Delhi? why just Delhi? You can Send one just about anywhere! Go on, dictate. - It's confidential. Dictate what you like. The world can go to hell. It doesn't concern me! To Dr. Butalia, General Secretary. Dear Comrade, Hostilities between Muslims and Sikhs, don't apply in Mano Majra. To call the violence a struggle between landlords and peasants .. .. would be to call it a Muslim-Sikh struggle, because most of the landlords are Sikhs, and the Muslims are peasants. Strategy and tactics must be reconsidered. Comrade Dostoevsky. That's D .. O .. S .. Dosto - vesky, right? - Yes, write. Iqbal Singhji, have you Gone to bed without food? There's spinach and some curd. Should I bring it? No, thank you, Bhaiji. I've eaten what I wanted. Yes, yes, our modest food .. - No, it's not that. It's just that my food would have gone waste. Then you must have some milk. Banta Singh, the headman, is getting some. I've put your bed on the terrace. It's very humid down here. Get up, Jugga! Get up! How he sleeps like a pig without a care in the world. Go on, get up! what are you doing? You can't arrest me like this! You made the warrant in front of me. Do you understand? The days of police rule are over! Sir, we are only doing our duty. It's not our fault. You settle this with the magistrate. I'll report all of you! Including the police and the magistrate! It's nothing to do with us. Aren't you ashamed harrassing a sleeping man? Bhaiji, they're arresting me! For what? They don't even know themselves! You are getting arrested? This is wonderful! It will only enhance your reputation! Gandhiji, Nehru, Patel - all went to jail! what are you talking about? A telegram! Give it to me. - Yes, of course. Send a telegram to my comrades. Say I've been arrested and to send help from Delhi. The struggle is on! - Son, wear your clothes at least. Yes, quite right! Don't worry! It's not the first Time I'm going to jail. I'll be back within a few months. All I had was my spear. I didn't kill anyone. Nooran, what is all this commotion about? Nothing much, only the Police arresting Jugga. Again? God knows when Jugga will learn. Are you off to jail again, Jugga? - I'll be back. Come inside. You don't need to watch such things. Yes, Abbu. So, what village are you from? - I don't belong to a village. I've come from Delhi. I've been sent to organise the peasants, but it seems the Government does not like my coming here. In our village everyone says that it's Mahatma Gandhi's .. .. Government in Delhi. It must be our own rule now. Yes, the Englishmen have gone, but what have you got out of independence. Food? Clothes? You are wearing the same handcuffs and fetters .. .. which the English put you in. Babuji, I'm the local ruffian. It runs in our family. Jail is written on our foreheads, And in the lines of our fate. I tell you no matter what, whenever I want to do something right .. .. or go straight, Halt! who is the other chap you've brought? He's from the city, Inspector sahib. He was roaming in the village. Under the circumstances, I thought you would want me to arrest him. No, I don't suppose you have brains of your own! I send you on a small job, and you still make a mess of it. Are you blind? Can't you see he is the same man, who got off the train with us yesterday? The train? I did not see him on the train. I saw him loitering in the village. I thought he's a stranger. There's been a murder. The situation is not right. He may well be the killer. So I brought him in. You ***! Some day you will arrest the Governor and say .. .. I ordered you to do so. Are you after my job? Or you just want me fired? Now take him inside and strip-search him. I'll be with you soon. Iqbal, but Iqbal what? Iqbal Chand, Iqbal Singh or Iqbal Mohammed? what is your religion? what do you mean by religion? I belong to the People's Revolutionary Communist .. .. Party of United India. Really! Fine, take off your trousers. This is outrageous! Nothing is outrageous to the police. Come on, take them off! So, you're a Muslim. No. I was circumcised in England, After an infection. You don't know, but Avtar Singh khairon .. .. of the Congress party is my uncle. Is he? And I suppose the Governor is your father-in-law? A-class, and that one in C-class. Juggia, you're back again. Is this a prison, or Your father-in-law's house? Father-in-law's house, sahib, so many policemen's .. .. daughters having been with me .. Jugga, you will not desist from your wickedness! wait till the Inspector sahib hears what you said .. .. and he will have your mouth stuffed with red chillies! How do you know he is a Muslim League worker? I had him stripped, sir. Then fill in the warrant of arrest correctly. Name - Mohammed Iqbal. Father's name - something or the other, or just father unknown. Caste - Muslim Occupation - Muslim League worker. wait! wait! Do not leave things half done. Enter in your police diary that .. .. Ramlal's murderers have not yet been traced, but that information about them is expected soon. Didn't you say Jugga had something to do with this? Yes, sir. To humiliate him, the dacoits threw glass bangles .. .. in Jugga's courtyard before leaving. Apparently, he refused to join them in their venture. But don't worry, I'll get the names out of him in 24 hours. Names! Give us names. I don't know any. - who else would know, if not you? Sir, your uncle was a bandit, and so was your grandfather. Your nephew is one of us. would they steal from their own village? we don't do that. If not you, then who did it? How did these bangles end up at your house? Bangles? Your mother said that on the night of the murder, these bangles were dropped in your courtyard. Pity, they're broken. Otherwise I would have made you wear them .. .. and dance for us like a nautch girl. I'll kill the ***! Let me out! Coming to my village .. I'll kill him! who? Malli. India is ours! India forever! what train is that? - who knows, Abbu? what is wrong with the trains? They seem to run at all odd hours now. This morning the mail train didn't run at all. I was late in making the call to prayer. I heard at least two trains go through late last night. Yes, I heard them too. It makes no sense. Allah protect us. Now that our eyes have met, do not leave me keep me protected from the hostile world Delicate as I am Say you will not hurt me Do not forget matters of the heart keep me protected from the hostile world Enough! Enough of this! You, my love, you stay with me, and you, old woman, you go to hell, where the temptress shall suffer more than the tempted! Are you hungry? - Yes. I'll get you some food. But why haven't you eaten? There was nothing in the house to eat. why? Just yesterday I gave money to that old woman. It's not the money! In Chundunnugur, it's unsafe for the Muslims to go out. Oh, you Muslims! How did you get here then? Inspector Sahib sent your car .. .. and nobody touches the Government's car. Listen, little girl, I don't intend doing Anything without your consent. Forget it .. Just sing some little song from the films. These nights, the seasons, the laughter Do not forget them though you can forget me She is as old as my daughter, as my daughter would have been. I held her dead in my arms. Her body was as light as a flower; even the weight of her soul had left her. I thought I would carry my child through the cities, my dead child, asking the world to cry with me. Look, this is what my God has done for me. Sir? Still, my eyes are dry .. because my arms are full. Sir, what is your wish? Gone .. She's gone .. who? The District Magistrate's daughter. Sir, don't cry. I'll do whatever you want. Sir, the Military! Yes, District Magistrate Hukumchand. Lance Naik kartar Singh Sodhi, Sir. what is it? To assist you, we are Cordoning off your railway station. with the help of the police, we'd like to obtain some kerosene, any oil, and firewood from the villages. My men will do the heavy work. Next time use purified butter otherwise how am I .. .. expected to keep my women satisfied. If you keep the law happy, Chundunnugur will satisfy your needs. That will be the day! You keep coming here. Don't you like it on the outside? How can I help it? Just be happy. - You too. Sir? Can I ask you something? what? You must have been abroad? - Yes, many times Then you must have slept with many women there? Yes, that's true. Quite a few times. Must be lots of fun, Babuji? white women, soft as silk, women like houris from paradise. And we are stuck here with black buffaloes! There's no such Difference between women. As a matter of fact, white women are not very exciting. Are you married? who will have Jugga, Babuji? I get my pleasure where I can. You must be having your share of fun? Sure, I make do with ***. when I go to Ferozepur for a hearing, I usually save money from the lawyers, and then, sir, you should see what fun I have! So much so, that the women Finally cover their ears .. and scream ''Enough! Enough!'' Beseech me in God's name to stop and spare them, take my money back, and just go! Once you marry a woman who's a match for you, you will be the one to cover your ears, and scream ''Enough! Enough!'' I wonder when the rains will come. Allah protect us, we are passing through bad times. You are right, Imam sahib, the times are bad. who? Banta Singh? - I wish to speak to everyone, uncle. Yes, yes, go ahead. Everyone listen carefully. Take kerosene oil and firewood from your houses, and hurry outside the village. Two army trucks will arrive there shortly. Oh, hurry up! Hurry! You'll be paid. But Lambardara, who gave these orders and why? I'm just carrying a message from the Deputy Sahib. These are his orders. Hurry! Sardar sahib, is all well? Move along. Don't you see I'm busy. That's it then. Come to the camp and collect the money. Lambardara, why don't you tell us what is going on? what is the big secret? Brother, don't talk like children. If I knew, why would I not tell you? The headman is right. Let's all go to our homes. You can see what they are doing from your rooftops. Sir, the girl .. what girl? Look, none of us have had a wink of sleep. I haven't slept either. Oh! That girl. Sir, I want to go home. I'll see to it, my precious, that you go. But not now. You can't go to Chundunnugur now why? If you permit, I can even walk there .. .. and if you wish, I could come back tonight. No, I'll ask for the car. I don't understand, Abbu. why are you being so stubborn? No! There's Something terrible happening. I want to see for myself. Something's burning. what are they burning? Allah! They are burning them? what else can they do with the bodies of dead Hindus and Sikhs? what else do you see? There are people Standing on their rooftops. There are some others coming this way, holding bundles. From where? which direction? From what they now call the ''border'', Pakistan. They spared the driver and the guard, so that the train would pass through the stations. No one had seen this before, the devil break loose from his moorings. what vengeance was this? If ever I return, your cities I will burn. And there will be no end to it. Magistrate, sir! Get your men to keep those people away. I don't want the soldiers fighting civilians. You idiot, can't you see them? - Move, you lot! May we approach you, sir? No, I don't wish to speak to anybody right now. Is it the magistrate sahib? Hukumchand sahib? what is it? My daughter and I've seen refugees coming from across the river. Now they are all sheltering in the Sikh temple. we've always lived in Mano Majra in true brotherhood .. .. and wish to continue doing so. what brotherhood? There were hundreds of people on that train from Pakistan. They are all ashes now. - Lance Naik Sodhi! I am responsible for the civil order in this district. I was speaking to them. Sir, I am accountable only to my commanding officer. If these villagers don't leave Before I fire the third shot, I will have to order my men to shoot. I thought, let the dust settle, but it soon became a storm. The problem was not .. that the Sikhs hated the Muslims in my district, the problem was that they loved them, loved them too well. Already the refugees had started coming into Mano Majra. Soon the agitators would come. The fanatics. Then what would I do? They would slaughter the Muslims. More death, more bodies. I can't wash the smell of death from my nostrils. Tell the driver to take back the old woman and the musicians. Don't get angry. At least tell him .. He doesn't want to meet anyone! How can you say that? God protect you, sir! Your honour, may your pen inscribe sums in thousands, Hundreds of thousands. Go away! Get lost! Bearer, send them back! Come. Lie down. In the name of the guru, give us shelter. we've lost everything and come a long way. Yes, of course, come. Come, brothers. Jarnail Singhji, you've caught great, big chickens today! Makhan Singh, the Chicken may be big or small, but when Jarnail Singh wields his stick, even the big ones get deflated! Malli, stop you ***! wait till I get my hands on you! I'll *** your mother! Listen Jugga, I had nothing to do with it. Ask them. I didn't even step into Mano Majra. You are lying! I saw you with my own eyes, you ***! Let me get out, I will *** you all. Don't you abuse us! Tell him to stop! You think, I'm afraid of you? All you are good for is .. .. knocking up the weaver's daughter. Shut up, you ***! I'll kill you! I'll *** you all! I'll tear you limb from limb! ''To do a great right we must do a little wrong'' I don't understand? Merchant of venice. Shakespeare. Didn't you read it in school? No, sir. I don't read novels. To do a great right, you sometimes have to do a little wrong. who have you arrested for Lala Ramlal's murder? Malli, sir. But before you said it was that ruffian, Jugga. Sir, Jugga told us that it was Malli's doing. Jugga was out on a secret mission that night. what secret mission? The whole world knows, sir, He's in love with the blind mullah's daughter. Don't muddle my brain with irrelevant facts. This Malli, is he a Muslim? - No, sir, a Sikh. well, then he didn't commit the murder. Understand? Put him in a tonga and take him to the village. Release him in front of the villagers and apologise. One more beating and he'll confess to anything. Do as I say! Then spread the rumour .. .. that Sultana and his gang have been spotted in the village. But according to our information, sir, Sultana has already left for Pakistan. After Ramlal's murder. And this Iqbal, say his name is Muhammad Iqbal, and he is a Muslim, a member of the Muslim League of Pakistan, from whom he receives telegrams. Yes, sir. we have one here which Telegraph Babu .. .. was trying to deliver to the jail. Read it. ''Comrade Dostoevesky, ask all party members .. .. to oppose the country's partition, and to organise marches and strikes in their areas, in favour of the country's solidarity. Comrade Dr. Roy.'' Ask the Telegraph Babu to prepare a telegram like this : '' Muhammed Iqbal, Pakistani Commando troops .. .. will soon arrive and occupy Mano Majra. Equip all Muslims with whatever weapons you have''. Then send an actual telegram .. .. to the Pakistani Border force, asking them to immediately evacuate the Muslims from here. Oh! I see. You see? The blind Mullah will see first. Sir, you are a great man. I truly desire to learn from you. Iqbal sahib, teach him how to go on the straight and narrow. Shut up! Babuji, you know it's because of these people .. .. and the government, that I am what I am. Isn't that so, sir? Babuji, my mother has sent some food. will you have some? who is going to occupy the next cell? I don't know, Babuji. But, I think, they've finally arrested Ramlal's murderers. But I thought they had arrested you for the murder? God forbid! kill my own village moneylender? I didn't murder anybody, Babuji. - No? In fact, I was being murdered myself that night! I've ordered some breakfast for you. You didn't eat last night. Is that what is upsetting you? The Muslims are being evacuated from Chundunnugur. But Inspector sahib told us we could stay. Anyway, we singers are neither Hindus nor Muslims. Men of all faiths come to hear us sing. Still you should be careful, Particularly when there's trouble. why should I be scared? we have good contacts with many people. And I have the eminent magistrate himself to protect me. As long as I have his protection .. .. no one can touch me. Do you want me to go to Pakistan? Go on! Let loose these ***! what's the matter? Have you Forgotten your old friends? You won't even look towards us. But, my friend, we'll miss you. Oh, let him be. Let him be. wait, wait! You seem to be very angry! But why are you so sad? wait, now I understand. Your soul is tormented by love for someone. That's it, isn't it? Is there any message we can convey for you? A love message maybe? To the weaver's daughter? Seems Sardar Juggut Singh is a little upset today. Doesn't even answer our salutations. Its quite all right. we do not mind. we'll still greet him. Salutations, Sardar Juggut Singhji! Salutations, brother. Let go, you ***! He will kill him! Don't you see? Let go, Jugga! You'll kill him! Let go, you ***, otherwise I'll shoot! I'll get you for this, You ***! Remove the ***! Take him away. what's wrong with you people? He did what he wanted and you kept quiet? kept watching? He could have killed him! Shut up, you Englishman's son! what have I done to you that you talk so much? Inspector sahib, the other cell must be vacant now. Can't you shift me there? Certainly, Mr. Iqbal. we'll do all we can to make you comfortable. we could send for tables, chairs.. an electric fan, maybe? Stop here. Release them. Have any of you seen Sultana, that Muslim bandit, or any of his gang? Sometimes they come here for provisions, but not for weeks now. They were seen here on the night of Lala Ramlal's murder. These necklaces were taken from his house. They were pawned by some villagers. If you can identify them, report to the headman. I feel, you should ask Bhai Meet Singh. He knows everything. Yes, this one, this belongs to the weaver's wife. She's dead. I don't know whether it was pawned or not. That's all right, Bhai Meet Singh. But that Muslim League agitator, what's his name? Muhammed Iqbal? wasn't he staying with you in the Gurudwara? Yes, but you're mistaken. He's a Sikh, not a Muslim. He's left behind his toothpaste. I'm not mistaken. The whole village knows he used to go to the mosque. Maybe he worships God by a different name. Then, maybe, he also sends telegrams to Pakistan .. .. with information about us. what do you think, brothers? If he is a Sikh, why has he cut his hair and beard? He told me he's lived abroad for many years. what about the telegram that was found? Look, I will fight till the end to protect our Muslim brothers. But now outside pressures are forcing our hand. I feel we are sitting on a volcano .. .. that may erupt any day. well, brothers, what is your decision about us? Our decision? what are you saying, uncle? This is your village as much as ours! what have we to do with Pakistan? we were born here and so were our ancestors. But now there is fear among us. Once we lived together as brothers. So what is your advice to us now? Uncle, till we are around, no one dare harm you. Thank you son, but let the older and wiser speak. Listen to me, uncle. I feel till the situation improves, all our Muslim brothers from the village .. .. should go to a safe place. Quite right. - Perhaps, you should go to a camp. Don't worry, we will look after your .. .. houses and cattle, while you are away. You are right, Lambardara. May God bless you. Everybody's heard the decision. Tomorrow morning we will leave for the camp. Nooran? Yes, Abbu? - where are you? Let us go. who is it? - It's me, Nooran. what brings you here at this hour? what do you want? Has Jugga come back? what have you to do with Jugga? Does your father know you go to .. .. strangers' homes at odd hours like a tart? we are going away tomorrow. So? why should you come to see us? Go where you like. I can't leave. Jugga has promised to marry me. Get out! You, a weaver's daughter, marry a Sikh peasant! Go away or I will go and tell your father .. .. and the whole village. Go to Pakistan! Leave my Jugga alone. All right, Bibi, I'll go. Don't be angry with me. when Jugga returns, tell him I give him the Sikh salutation, '' Truth is Eternal''. All right, I'll tell him. what is it? Speak up. How do I tell you .. Jugga's child .. How far is your pregnancy? Two months. You there, go fetch the head man quickly. Nooran? Oh, Nooran. where have you been? It's time. The rest have left already. Let's go. You blind owl, do I look like Nooran to you? who is it? who is it? Allah have mercy. I have nothing. Here then, you can have the caste mark of Hindus. It will protect you from people like me, who hate Muslims. All Muslim brothers going to Pakistan, come out! Father? Father! who is it? villagers? we must leave this place as soon as possible. Stay with me, daughter. Don't leave me alone. where would I go, leaving you behind? Come, let us go now. Muslims this side, Sikhs over there! Brothers, I'm helpless. Forgive me. I'm sorry, but I have no means .. .. to carry your belongings. The convoy is not going to Pakistan by road. First, we are taking you to the Chundunnugur Refugee Camp .. .. and from there by train to Lahore. You can only take what you can carry, nothing more. But Sir, this is their property. How can they leave it behind? who will take care of it? Don't argue. This is not the time to argue. Go and see for yourself. All I have are these trucks. I can't carry their bullock carts, beds, animals, pots and pans in them. Sir, the people of this village are famous for their carefree ways. They can't look after themselves, how will they look after someone else's property? But do not worry, we'll take care of it. Just leave two or three soldiers behind .. .. to make sure no one interferes. Don't listen to him, sir! It is settled. Arrangments have been made to look after your belongings .. .. until all this is over. But sir, these people .. Now, I give you all five minutes to get into the trucks. Those who get in will go. Those who are not in, will be left behind. Pakistan! - Forever! Today it's you, waris Shah that I seek Rise from you grave, wherever it be, and speak And once again re-open love's book Turn another page and take a look when one daughter of the Punjab shed tears, you composed a thousand songs of lament. Today, a hundred thousand daughters cry, O, waris Shah lend them your ears Sir, you've got blisters on your feet. Haseena, I had a wife, a daughter .. She would have been almost your age. Is she dead? Ever since then, I have completely immersed myself in work, this district, the land revenue, the crime. And now some people are sending me corpses .. .. by the thousands as presents. ''Greetings, your honour! Accept these gifts.'' Sir, I don't understand all this. But you are a good person. You know, people now say my body has filled out. You are so innocent. Despite what you do, so much innocence? what do I do? I mean.. dancing, singing, for men. You may have done a million wrongs with men .. .. and I could have sinned with you, but it would still be nothing .. .. compared to the gruesome wickedness of this world. Sir, speak to my grandmother. And then you can .. you can keep me with you. keep you? You mean marry you? Sir, I haven't done anything like this with any man. I have done other things. But for you, I would do anything. Haseena, you are the most delicious thing .. .. that ever crossed my weary life, but .. Don't you want me? That's all right. I don't care if you don't like me .. .. because other men like me a lot. I've been with other men, Because I wanted to. Some paid. Others didn't. Haseena, don't talk like that. Perhaps, after this night, you will meet a young man, waiting for you - just for you. In Pakistan. Being a refugee's wife might be difficult, but far better that than being a magistrate's ***. In that case, send me back to my grandmother. whatever her faults, she's what I have .. .. all I have. Perhaps, you are right. Bearer! - Yes, Sir! Tell the driver to drop Haseena Begum back to Chundunnugur. Haseena, take it. You will need it. Grab their belongings! Burn their houses down! Take what you can. Grab their cattle, their chicken, their daughters! kill the children! Don't spare a Muslim! Plunder and loot! Headman! Oh, Headman! what's the matter, karnaila? Eat later. Come see what's happening by the river. It looks as if the flood waters have swept away some village. Did you hear that? Even the light of the train is switched off. There was no whistle either. - It's like a ghost train. For God's sake don't talk like that. Maybe it's a goods train. Allah first created the Light All beings are his worshippers From the Light The whole universe was created Thus we are all equal and the same Is anybody here or is everyone dead? Oh, so you aren't dead, just a bunch of eunuchs. I ask, does this village belong to Sikhs? Yes, Sir. There were Muslims here, but they have gone. what kind of Sikhs are you? Do you know how many Trainloads of dead Sikhs .. .. have come across the border? They are raping your sisters and daughters .. .. and you are sitting here singing songs? well done, brave men, well done! But what can we do, Sardarji? Now listen to me carefully. If they kill one of our men, we'll kill two of theirs. For every woman they rape or abduct, we will rape two. For each home they loot, we'll loot two. what bravery is there in killing innocent people? who is innocent? Those children of Hindus and Sikhs .. .. who were killed in front of their parents' eyes, weren't they innocent? This is war, Bhaiji, not some trial with arguments. But forget this old man. Is there anyone here who would fight for Sikhism, for Guru Gobind Singh, who the cowardly Muslims stabbed to death while he slept? But what must we do? If you have the courage, listen. Tomorrow night a Trainload of Muslims .. .. is to cross the bridge to go to Pakistan. If you are real men, they should meet the same fate .. .. that they handed out to us. But this train will come from Chundunnugur. I don't care if it comes from hell, I'll send it right back. My men and I will be there! who will join us? Is there any brave Sikh amongst you? Yes, sir! Our life is at your service. Tell us where we have to go. All my men will come with you. Excellent! At least there is one man amongst cowards. Just tell us when we have to leave. Anyone else? I'm ready to come! - Me, too! I'll come! So will I. Let us say together, ''Truth is Eternal''! well, Inspector sahib, let them kill! Let them all kill. what am I to do? The world is going mad. Let it go mad. when did you hear of this? Late last night. The head man and a villager came to the police station .. .. to report the matter. we were busy the whole day evacuating .. .. all Muslim families in Chundunnugur. All the Muslims? Yes, all the Muslims. Even .. - Yes, sir. I suppose they will all come back, when all this blows over. This can't last forever. within a week they will be back in Chundunnugur, and the Sikhs and Muslims will be drinking out of the same well. You may be right, sir. But it will take more than a week to happen. The Chundunnugur refugees are being taken to Pakistan by train tonight. The one these people in Mano Majra propose to attack. why don't you warn the camp commander? He may decide not to leave tonight. Your honour, mobs of armed villagers are thirsting for blood. If the refugees don't go, the camp may be destroyed. I have only fifty armed policemen, and not one of them would fire a shot at a Sikh. Inspector, are those fellows still in custody? who, sir? The ones who were arrested for the murder of that moneylender. That ruffian, Jugga, and that Mohammed Iqbal? No, no, no! He's a Sikh. He wears the bangle. Iqbal Singh. But the other day you said he was a Muslim? He's not. Release him. And that Juggut Singh, you call him Jugga, the ruffian. - Yes, sir. He's in love with that blind Mullah's daughter. Nooran. Yes. Release him. Release both of them. Put them in a tonga and send them back to the village. They buried one lot, cremated another. The river was flooded with corpses. Muslims were evacuated. what more do you want to know, my friend? You should have seen what happened in Chundunnugur yesterday? If we had been even five minutes late .. .. in evacuating those Muslims, There would not have been one left alive. There were mobs waiting to kill. Mobs and mobs! Say together, ''Truth is Eternal''! Jugga, my son, you are back! welcome home! where's she? - who? You know who. She came to you, didn't she? Tell me, where is she? All the Muslims had to leave for the camp. I told her you would come to get her. How could you? She came to you for help. what could I do? There were soldiers everywhere .. .. and if she had stayed behind, she would either have been killed or worse. Malli and his gang .. Malli? His gang? what? I don't know. They have been looting and burning Muslim homes. And now they have joined with some other gang. There is talk that they plan to attack some train to Pakistan. Jugga! where are you going? Jugga, come back! You know something. Tell me what you know. They'll stretch a thick rope across the first span of the bridge. when the train passes under it .. .. it'll sweep off all the people sitting on the roof of the train. That could be three hundred, four hundred or may be more. Men with guns will Shoot at the windows. If they stop the train, Many more will get killed. who's it? Jugga, you? what are you doing here at this hour? Bhaiji, I want the Guru's word. will you read me a verse? The holy book is at rest for the night. why do you want the Guru's word? It doesn't matter. Just read a few lines from the Holy Book. It doesn't matter what. Read me anything. Quickly! He who made the night and day The days of the week and the seasons He who made the breezes blow, the waters run, the fires and the lower regions Made the earth - the temple of law He who made creatures of diverse kinds with a multitude of names, Made this the law - By thought and deed be judged forsooth, For God is True and dispenseth Truth Greetings, sir. No, Jugga. Babuji isn't well. He's taken medicine to sleep. Fine brother. Just give him my regards. - All right. Fate cheats us. She deals us bad cards, and the good cards only when we have lost everything. She won't go to her refugee and a new life. She will go straight to hell and damnation. I should have stopped her. It would have been better than putting her on the train to Pakistan. But I sit here drinking my whisky.. .. because I love life so much, I will do anything to survive. There are those who don't, yet history searches for them, picks them out. Once the sound of trains in the night was such a comfort. Silence! Otherwise we won't hear the train. The train is coming. Get back, you fool! who is that? what's he doing up there? Looks like one of our men. Must be adjusting the rope. Come down, you fool, or you'll be killed! what are you doing? Come down, darn you! Today, everyone a great lover claimeth be Everyone covetous of love and beauty But where today Should I look or find O waris Shah another poet like thee Today, waris Shah, it is you I seek Rise from your grave wherever it be, and speak And once again re-open love's book Turn another page and take a look.
