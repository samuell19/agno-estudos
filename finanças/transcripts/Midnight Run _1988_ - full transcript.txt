Shit! - Shit! - Come on. Hey! Hey, Marvin, what're you doin'? - He's mine, Jack. Get lost. - Fuck you, he's yours! Eddie assigned this guy to me. What the hell are you doin'? Straighten it out with Eddie. I'll collect the money. I almost got killed trying to get this guy. - He shot at me. What the f... - Back off, goddammit! I said I'm taking him, all right? This guy's worth 1,200. OK, OK, Marvin. What the hell're we fighting for? We're friends. Nothing personal, Jack, but fuck off, all right? Take it easy! Jesus! Marvin, watch out! What the fuck's goin' on? You guys ain't cops. No, we're ballet dancers. Didn't your mother ever teach you how to react to strangers? Not shoot at 'em? Hey, Marvin! Thanks for the car. You sleep and I'll bring it back a little later. Got a delivery for you, Gooch. Hey, Jack, the soda machine's been out for a week and a half. Check that for me, would ya? OK. All right. Give you any trouble? Did you give me any trouble? Fuck you, man! He didn't give me any trouble. - Fuck you too. - Move it! Slap it. Moscone's Bail Bonds. No, it's cash only. No cheques, no cards. I'm sorry, man. That's the policy. I wish I could help you out. Sorry. Just dropped off Bouchet. Is Eddie in? So you finally caught someone, Jack! Jerry, is he in? I think that's terrific! Jack. Tryin' to reach you since last night. What you got for me? Been trying to reach me? Got Bouchet. Oh, Bouchet. Good score, Jack. 900, right? No, it's 1,200. No, nine. It's 1,200. Come on. No. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Stomach's killing me. I'm going over to Chin Loo's for breakfast. I wanna talk to you. About what? - I'll talk to you over there. - Can I have my money first? Of course. What d'you think? I'm gonna try to stiff you? You? Never! He would never try and stiff me. - Do I detect some kind of sarcasm here? - Never! Where have I inherited this reputation? I have never done business with anybody - and Jerry is my witness - that I have ever, ever, ever... Does that phone ever ring...? Has that phone ever rung with a complaint about me? Never! Never! So let's go. I'll buy you some breakfast. - I don't need breakfast. - Well, have an early lunch. Let's go. You ever hear of a guy named Jonathan Mardukas? - The Duke, yeah, I know who he is. - What do you know? He's that accountant that embezzled a couple of million from some Vegas wiseguy and gave it to charity. That's very good. Only thing is that it wasn't a couple of million. It was $15 million. It wasn't some Vegas wiseguy. It was Jimmy Serrano. I know, I know. I can read the papers. Look, I don't want to bring up the past but... Isn't Serrano the guy that ran you out of Chicago when he was running things back then? He didn't run me out. Yeah, right. You gave up being a cop to do this shit. What's your point? The point, Jack. I bailed out the accountant. I didn't know who he was at the time. Had I known, there was no way I would have put up the bond. I mean it's only a matter of time before Serrano vanishes this guy from the planet. And I'm out 450,000. You're out 450,000 on this guy? - No. - No? No, because I got you and you're the best. And you're going to find him and bring him back. Yeah, right. How do you even know this guy's still alive? Because this guy is crazy. He sends postcards to Serrano. He's telling him what a great time he's having with his money. How much time you got left? Friday midnight I default, I eat the 450. This Friday? That's five days. Forget it! You go find him. - Give me my money. - All right. Listen to me. I'll give you four... I'll give you fifty grand. Fifty grand? I gotta chase you down for 1,200. Forget about it. - No, no, no, Jack, please... - Jack nothing. What else you got? God! I ain't got nothing. This is it. You don't find this guy, I'm outta business. Eddie... I'll do it for 100,000. 100,000? Are you out of your mind? This is an easy gig. It's midnight run, for Christ's sakes! Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm tired of getting shot at. I'm tired of this miserable fucking business, every low life that I run into. If you're gonna pay me, you gotta pay me what's right. You want me for this job, give me what's right. First of all, the guy is an accountant. He's not gonna shoot you. All you have to do is find him. You put him in a bag, hit him with a rubber hose, bring him home. Easy for you to say. Listen to me. It's 100,000, no more, no less. And I want a contract... - Contract? - That's right. I want it in writing. $100,000 and I'll have The Duke here for you by Friday night. Now, can I have my $1,200, please? You're worse than any crook I ever put a bond up for. Stanley? Stan! Hey, big dog! How are you? What you doin' here? Listen. I need a favour. I need to see the booking slip of a Jonathan Mardukas, M- A-R-D-U-K-A-S. - Yes, sir. - What's that? It's the number he called right after he was arrested. 212 area code. Looks like I'm going to New York. Are you Jack Walsh? - Excuse me. - Are you Jack Walsh? I'm sorry, do I know you? Alonzo Mosely, FBl. That's a nice badge. How can I get one of those? I wanna talk to you, Jack. Yeah? Why don't you call my social secretary? Very funny. I wanna talk to you. Take your... Take your hands off! Jeez! Take it easy! - It's a $10 fine for jay walking... - Shut up! What I wanna know is are you working on anything to do with Jonathan Mardukas? Never heard of him. I believe you have heard of him. Let me tell you something, asshole. We've been working on this Jimmy Serrano thing for about six years. Mardukas is my shot. I'm going to bring him in to Federal Court. And I don't want any third rate rent-a-thug who couldn't cut it as a cop in Chicago bringing him to LA on some bullshit local charge. Do I make myself understood? Can I ask you something? These sunglasses - they're really nice. Are they government issue or do all you guys go like to the same store to get them? Do I make myself understood? Can't you take a joke? Get him outta here. - No, let's talk some more. - Get the fuck outta here! If I hear of anything, I'll let you know. Have a nice day. - Can I have my sunglasses back? - Here are your sunglasses. Thanks. Thanks for this too. Alonzo Mosely. Alonzo! How's that? Looks fine. To me. Harold Longman, please. Harry? Jack Walsh. How're you doin'? You got that address check on that phone number for me? OK, thanks a lot, Harry. Say hello to Julie for me. OK, bye. You Jack Walsh? - Who wants to know? - That's a yes. We'd really like to have a word with you. Oh yeah? What about? It involves big cash, a lot of prizes. I'll make it short and sweet. People I work for, really interested in your visit here. Oh yeah? Who are the people you work for? An old friend of yours from Chicago days. You here for The Duke. You think he's in New York and we think you're right. That's a nice jacket. What is it? Goat skin? Come on, Joey, please, will you? Never mind him. The way I hear it... You didn't cooperate with my boss a few years back. Is that the way you heard it? Yeah, but I got a newsflash for you, Jack. He'd pay a hell of a lot more for The Duke than that putz bail bondsman back in LA. - Oh yeah? How much more? - How about a one with six zeros? - Are you gonna propose? - Propose? Propose, cos if you're not, quit staring at me, OK? - Staring at you? - You're staring. Back off, will you, please? Come on. Mr Walsh. Your car is located in space number 206. You should catch our shuttle bus just through these doors. - Thank you. - Here's my number, Jack. Ask for Tony Darvo - that's me. They'll put your through to wherever I am. Be good to yourself this time, OK? Tell Jimmy I said hello. Hello? - Hello? Mrs Nelson? - Yes? Alonzo Mosely, Federal Bureau of Investigation. How are you this afternoon? I'm fine. Let me get right to the point, if I may, Mrs Nelson. An agent in our Los Angeles office discovered a detail that was somehow overlooked until now. It seems that when a Jonathan Mardukas was arrested, you were the first person he called. Is that correct, Mrs Nelson? - Are you there, Mrs Nelson? - Yes. Needless to say, this is a matter of great concern to us and if it would not be too much trouble, we'd like you to come down tomorrow morning to 26 Federal Plaza. Do you think you could do that? I suppose so. About 9.00 am. Yes. Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely. Thanks for your cooperation. Have a nice day. Hello? Dana, it's Helen. The FBI just called. They want to speak to me about Jonathan. Oh, my God! Helen. Helen, what's going on? Jonathan, the FBl just called. They know we spoke the night you were arrested. Hang up the phone, Helen, right now. Ah! Sweet music! I'm thinking, do you think there's enough room? Did you check...? Shampoo and all that. - What is it, Jon? - I don't know. OK, OK, Heidi. OK. Alonzo Mosely, FBl. You're under arrest. Get this fuckin' dog outta here. - Get this dog outta here, ma'am. - Not you. You stay there. - Get the dog, ma'am. Get the dog! - Do it, do it. Heidi, come on, girl. Come on. Come on out. Good girl. Don't move or I'll shoot right through the glass. Get over here. Put your hands up against the wall, hands up against the wall. Spread your feet. Relax. It won't be a problem. Put your left hand behind your head. Put your left... That's it. You're taking me to the airport, aren't you? You don't look like an FBl agent to me. Yeah? Well, you don't look like a duke to me. If you're an FBl agent, why don't you just take me to the FBl office? If you don't be quiet, this is going to be the worst trip of your life. You work for Jimmy Serrano, don't you? I don't work for that piece of shit. Your bail bondsman hired me to bring you back to LA and that's what I'm doin'. - I got money, you know. - I'm sure you do. I'll give you whatever you want. Start by shutting up. I know you all of two minutes and already I don't like you. Gee, that's too bad. I really like you I can't keep you cuffed on a commercial flight and I got to check my gun with my luggage, but you fuck with me once and I'm gonna break your neck. - I can't fly. - What? You heard me - I can't fly. No, no, you're gonna have to do better than that, pal. I don't have to do better than that because it's the truth - I can't fly. - I suffer from aviophobia. - What does that mean? It means I can't fly. I also suffer from acrophobia and claustrophobia. Tell you what - if you don't cooperate, you're going to suffer from fisto-phobia. Moscone's Bail Bonds. Jerry, put Eddie on the phone. Jack, what's the progress? - I got him. - You got who? The Duke. He's standing right here. You got him, already? Sure do. Want to say hello? Say hello to your bail bondsman Eddie Moscone. Hello. There you go - Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh. Jack, I love you! What happened? How did this happen? Where d'you find him? I found him in New York. We're at the airport. Holy Christ! This is wonderful! This is wonderful news! I'll be in your office by midnight tonight and I'm telling you right now, Eddie, I don't want any bullshit. I want the money tonight. So go empty out one of your Swiss bank accounts. No, Jack, you don't have to worry about nothing. My best money ever spent. OK, I'll see you in a few hours. All right. I'll see you later. Night. So what's that all about? Jerry, Walsh got The Duke! Walsh got The Duke? - He got him! He got The Duke! - No kidding! This calls for a celebration. I'll get some doughnuts. How do you think Walsh found him so fast? Yeah, hello. Tony, this is Jerry. - Jerry who? - Jerry Geisler. - What are you doin'? - I'm eating dinner. What do you want? Look, I hate to bother you, but I thought you'd like to know... that Walsh found The Duke in New York. They're flying in tonight. They should arrive around midnight. Don't forget me, babe. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kid, yeah. - Thanks. Goodnight. Looks like your old friend found the accountant. They'll be flying into LA around midnight. Have him met at the airport. - You understand? - Done. - Can I take your coat? - That's fine, thanks. - Can I take your coat? - No, thank you. First class is nice. I could make a habit of this. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening to you. Would either of you like a drink before we take off? Yes, we would like one of your finest champagnes. Certainly. Let's see. Look at this. Only in America! What a country. Unbelievable. Think I'm gonna have the steak. How about you? I'm not hungry. Why don't you get the lobster because then I can get a little surf 'n' turf action going? I got a problem. I can't fly. I don't think you're taking me seriously. I'm taking you very seriously. I can't be on this plane. Do you think I haven't heard your story before? Who do you think you're travelling with? A fucking novice? Know what I'm talking about? That's it. Settle in. If you want to get up and talk, social, mingle with the rest of the passengers, be my guest - we ain't goin' nowhere. There's a couple of nice-looking people here. Better class of people. Your class. Probably all embezzlers too! * Come fly with me * Come fly away * Why don't you just try and relax? - Look, I... - Just calm down. Just relax and calm down. What are you getting so excited about? It's not... It's... No, I can't! I can't! No! No! No! - I can't. - Just relax. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What did I tell you? - Don't pull that shit on me. - No, no, I'm telling you... I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it! No! I can't. These things go down. These things go down. It's too big! It's too big. It can't go up. All right, everyone, just calm down. - All right, what's the problem? - It's nothing, sir. It's OK. Alonzo Mosely, FBl. This man is in my custody. I'm taking him back to Los Angeles. - There won't be any more problems. - I don't wanna fly. I can't, really. You can't take a prisoner aboard an aeroplane if he doesn't wanna fly. You should know that. I do, I'm sorry. I thought he was bluffing. I thought he was bluffing. I suggest you find some other mode of transportation. What the fuck are you smiling about? I love to travel by train. Oh yeah? What do you think this is - a class trip? Are you always this angry? Look, right now I'm in a great fucking mood. You wait till I'm cooped up on that thing for a while. You're not going to be smiling - you'll be running for the fucking jail cell. Still going to make your schedule? I'll make it. 14 hours to spare. Oh, nice! It's a double. - It's a double - nice lot of room. - Glad you like it. Good. Turn around. Thanks. Cuffs were starting to cut into my wrists. Thank you. It just gets the skin after a while. Get in there. What? Oh, come on! Come on! Oh, you know. Why would you do that? No, enjoy yourself. This is my room and that's your room. Goodnight! Hey, can I help you guys? Special Agent Mosely, FBl. Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely? What the hell are you talking about? You're here to pick up a prisoner, right? How d'you know that? He was afraid to fly so he got off the plane. He left with an Agent Mosely. Sir, that must mean that Walsh has your identification. Yeah? Is this moron number one? Put moron number two on the phone. Yeah, Jimmy, he's right here. Hold on. He's pissed. Yeah. I thought you told me this guy was gonna be on the plane. That's the information we got, Jimmy. That's the information we got. I'm gonna tell you something. I want this guy taken out, and I want him taken out fast. You and that other dummy better start getting more personally involved in your work or I'm gonna stab you through the heart with a fucking pencil. Understand me? You got it, Jimmy. Tony... He ain't mad at me, is he? Jack? Jack, I think this is illegal. Jack, I don't think you can keep a person in a bathroom like this. You know, it's very claustrophobic in here. Yeah, it is? Well, I tell you what. When we get to LA, you can tell the prison psychiatrist all about it. There's no air! There's no ventilation in here. I told you I was claustrophobic. Come on! What do you think I'm gonna do - jump off a train moving 90 mph? Jack? Jack! Jack? Good, thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good. Sit down. Thanks. Great. Very kind of you. That's much better. Thank you. Good. What are you doin'? What am I doin'? Arithmetic. Arithmetic? Maybe I can help you - I am an accountant. I was thinking after I turn your ass in and collect my money, I'm gonna open up a nice little coffee shop. How much exactly are you getting for me, if I may ask? I don't think that's any of your concern, but I'll tell you just to... Just to tell you. 100,000. 100,000. Does that mean you'd take 100,000 to let me go? Not by a long shot. 200,000? I never took a payoff in my life and I'm not gonna start with someone like you. Why not? Because you're a fuckin' criminal and you deserve to go where you're going and I'm gonna take you there, and if I hear any more shit outta you, I'm gonna fuckin' bust your head and put you back in that fucking hole. I'm gonna stick your head in the fuckin' toilet bowl and make it stay there. I have to tell you, a restaurant is a very tricky investment. More than half of them go under within the first six months. If I were your accountant, I'd have to strongly advise you against it. You would? Well, you're not my accountant. No. If I were your accountant... - I told you. I took you out here... - No, I'm just saying... that it's a very tricky business and if I were your accountant, I would really strongly have to advise you against it as... as an accountant. - You're not my accountant. - I know I'm not your accountant. I'm saying if I were your accountant. Jerry... How the hell could he miss the goddamn plane? He called from the airport. All right, all right, it's time to bring in Marvin. Call him up. He's in Pittsburgh. - Marvin Dorfler? - Yeah. Dorfler - under "D" in the Rolodex for "Jerk", Jerry. Can I at least have some French fries? I said no, pecker breath. Now shut up. Yeah, Dorfler. Marvin? Sweetheart, am I glad I got you. Boy, do I have a job for you. Yeah. I'm listening. First of all, I gotta apologise because we were trying to find you and it's a very important job and I couldn't find you so I had to give it to Walsh but now he's fucking it up, so... I don't know why you keep hiring that fucking guy. I know. I apologise. You are the best at what you do. You know that? Now listen. Do you know who Jonathan Mardukas is? - No. - Jonathan Mardukas, The Duke. - Eddie, I never heard of him. - All right. That's not important. What's important is that you find him and bring him back, OK? Last I heard, he had him in New York and now I don't know where the hell they are. If you find them, I'll give you what I'm giving Walsh. Yeah? What's that? 25,000. But you gotta have him back by Friday midnight. Otherwise the deal is off. Yeah, don't worry, Eddie. For 25 grand, I'll bring him in on a silver platter. Bring him any way you want, but bring him, OK? Bye. - Hey, scumbag. - Name's Carmine, fucko! Yeah, well, Carmine, today's your lucky day. Why is today my lucky day? Shut up. Yeah. Yeah, my name is Jack Walsh. Excuse me - John Wesley Walsh. I think I lost my credit card. Can you tell me the last place I used it? Yeah. 731-483-9521-13. The Amtrak office, Grand Central Station? Ah, yeah, yeah. I remember that now. Yeah, OK. Thanks very much. Hey... Maybe we ought to cancel that card? Yeah, thank you. Familiar with the word "atherosclerosis"? Cholesterol? You want, I'll outline a complete balanced diet for you. Mail it to me from C Block. Why would you eat that? Why? Cos it tastes good. But it's not good for you. I'm aware of that. Why would you do something that you know is not good for you? Because I don't think about it. That's living in denial. - Living in denial? - Yeah. I'm aware of that. So you're aware of your behaviour yet you continue to do things that aren't good for you. That sounds sort of foolish, don't you think, Jack? No. Stealing $15 million from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish. I didn't think I'd get caught. Now, that's living in denial. I'm aware of that. Oh, so you're aware of your behaviour and yet you continue to do things that aren't good for you. Sounds kind of foolish to me, don't you think, Jon? It was foolish. But taking 15 million of mob money and giving it to charity was good for a lot of people. Oh, so you pissed off a Mafioso killer just to be loved by a bunch of fuckin' strangers. That makes a lot of sense. Don't you want to be loved? Lots of people love me. Really? Who? Got an ex-wife and I got a daughter in Chicago. How do they put up with all your sarcasm? Beautifully. Haven't seen either of them in nine years. Think maybe we should go see them? No, I don't think maybe we should go see them. Thanks for the interest though. The job must've been tough on them. I didn't do this then. - What did you do? - I was a cop. You were a cop in Chicago? Then you must know all about Jimmy Serrano. Do you have the right to ask me certain questions? - Yeah, I think I do. - No, you don't. - I think I do. - No, you don't. Why not? Dinner's over. Let's go. I can see this is going to be some fuckin' trip, boy. Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Jack. I'm not going to be with you that much longer. What do you mean? From what I know about Serrano, if I go to jail, I'll be dead within 24 hours so sooner or later I'm gonna have to give you the slip. Sure! I'm glad you find it humorous. Let's go. Two dollars? That's all you're gonna leave? - That's 15%. - It's 13%. These people depend on tips for a living. Ah! Can I help you, sir? Yeah. I'm looking for this buddy of mine, Jack Walsh. He told me he'd meet me on this train. Yeah, Mr Walsh. He's in bedroom D, next car. - That next car? - Yes, sir, that way. - Thanks. - Sure thing. Have a good night. One word and you're dead, asshole. Holy shit! Son of a... How the fuck did you find out where I am? Fuck you! I ain't tellin' you shit. Marvin, don't force me to do something I don't wanna do. - What's going on here? - Everything's under control. Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBl. Radio ahead. I want the local police at the next stop to place this man under arrest. - What the fuck are you talking about? - That's enough outta you. Go ahead, get on the horn and call the cops. Is this good news or bad news? Apparently Mardukas and Walsh are on the Amtrak headed to Los Angeles. Another bounty hunter was arrested after he tried to take Mardukas away. I want the jet ready in 20 minutes. Where's Jack Walsh? He got off with the other guy, two or three stops ago. His real name's Mosely. I'm Mosely! I want to make a collect call to Eddie Moscone from a Jack Walsh. Moscone Bail Bonds. Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on. Jesus, Jack! Where the hell you been? Jack! I wanna talk to him. Jack, where are you? Where am I? Eddie, I want to ask you something. How come Dorfler wound up on my ass? Did you put him on this, you son of a bitch? Wait a minute, Dorfler? How can I put Dorfler on you? I don't even know where the fuck you are. - You had nothing to do with it? - Where are you? You got The Duke or what? You're damn right I got him. Where are you? Where am I? I'm somewhere between... I don't know Toledo and Cleveland. - We're getting on a bus. - Bingo! Bus? What are you gonna do...? Jack, are you out of your mind? Will you just shut up for a minute and listen to me. We're getting on a bus. I just wanted to let you know we're on our way, OK? Jack, don't hang up! Shit! What the hell is this guy doin'? I don't know. Listen... Maybe we outta get some doughnuts or something? Two one-way tickets to Los Angeles, please. Still gonna make our schedule? Don't worry, I'll get you there on time. Don't have any illusions. - lllusions? - lllusions. lllusions. I'm sorry, sir. This card's been cancelled. It's been cancelled? I'm sorry, that's a mistake. Would you please try it again? - I checked it twice, sir. - Please try it again. Please try it again. - Did you pay the bill? - Shut up. I'm sorry, sir. It's been cancelled. Ma'am, that is impossible. I pay my bills. - There is no way that... - It's cancelled. Shut up! - Please. - It's cancelled, sir. Would you like to try another credit card? - I don't have another credit card. - Or cash. Please would you just try that again? - No. - All right. Alonzo... Jack Walsh, Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is official business. I'm taking this man, he's in my custody. I'm taking him to Los Angeles, OK? So please try this once more. Jack Walsh is not the name on that badge, sir. Would you like me to call the FBl? Or would you like to pay cash? - How much is it? - $264 for two tickets. 264... There's 100. Got any money on you? A lot. You call that a lot of money? It's enough to get you where I'm gonna get you. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven. Got the whole fuckin' force after me? Who the fuck are you? Special Agent Mosely, FBl. Goddammit! I didn't do anything. Relax. Just wanna ask you a few questions, that's all. Yeah, fuckin' A. Help yourself. So what do you know about Jack Walsh? Ah, no! Come on! Come on! Cigarettes are killers. So are women. Not the right women. My wife and I have a wonderful relationship. She's stuck it out with me through all of this. Yeah, stuck it out with you and all your millions. What a trooper! I don't have millions, Jack. I gave it all to charity, remember? You didn't keep just a little for yourself, Jon? I kept enough to get away and stay hidden. Yeah, right! You know, if we change buses in Chicago, you're gonna have a couple of hours. I think you would be a better man if you use that time to look up your ex-wife and daughter. It's a perfect opportunity. Why don't you mind your own business? Let me ask you this. Why is it you haven't seen them in nine years? - Why? - Yeah. Just to get you off my back, I'll tell you why. She married a police lieutenant and I'm not very popular in the Chicago Police Department, OK? Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department? What? Do we know each other? Get... What...? Why? Why? What did you do? Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department? Something that really doesn't concern you. - She hurt you, Jack? - Yeah. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? I'm sorry you're hurt. I'm not hurt. - You just said you were hurt. - I'm not hurt. - You just said... - I didn't say I was hurt. - You said I was hurt. - I asked you if you were hurt. - You said yeah, I'm hurt. - That's cos you made me say it. You're starting to put words in my mouth. Jack, you're a grown man. You have control over your own words. You goddamn right, I do, so here come two words for you. Shut the fuck up. Excuse me. Walsh called Moscone about half an hour ago from outside Toledo. He's on an Interstate Coach Lines bus headed for Chicago. Come on. Sir, what do we do with this guy? Let him go. Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes. When's the last time you had a chest X-ray? You know about secondary smoke? You can give people lung cancer, who are innocent and trying to live healthy lives. Why don't you just go back to sleep, leave me alone, do whatever you have to do? Why don't you put the cigarette out? Why don't you shut up and leave me alone? Put the cigarette out, Jack. Why... Put the cigarette out. A pain in the ass, this guy is. Thank you. - I thought you were putting it out. - No, I'm not putting it out. Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department? Sid's downstairs. - What's up? - I think you and I should talk. What are you hanging around for? Take a walk. I heard somebody picked up Mardukas in New York. It's old news, Sidney. I'm already on it. I don't have to tell you what'll happen if he becomes a government witness. I can assure you that will not be the case. I assumed you were taking that position but I'm supposed to advise you against such action. Sidney, relax. Have a cream soda. Everything is gonna be all over within a few minutes. Who the fuck are these guys? Hands on the bus. All right, spread 'em. It's the fuckin' feds. Remember me? Agent Foster Grant. Alonzo, aren't you going to thank me for doing your job for you? Thank you, Walsh. Let's get the fuck outta here. Come on! - What the hell are you doing? - Keep moving. What? Come on! What are you doing? Are you there? Jesus Christ! All right, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Come on, goddammit! - All right. Wait a minute. Walsh! You son of a bitch! - Oh, my God! - Shut up. - What the hell was that? - Shut up. - Why were they shooting? - Those were Serrano's people back there. They're not even waiting for you to get to jail. You're turning me in. Why are we running away from the FBl? I gotta bring you back myself. Otherwise I won't get my money. I won't give you to the feds. Alonzo Mosely - isn't that the name you've been using? Let me see that. - Look at this wealth of information. - What? They've got a tap on Moscone's line. Son of a bitch! What are you doin'? What are you doin'? How far do you think we're gonna get in a stolen FBl car? What's that for? An inside joke between me and Alonzo. Tony Darvo, line one. Yeah? Sorry, Jimmy, it didn't happen. It didn't happen? Say that again, Tony. It just didn't happen. The cops were all over the place. There was a million fucking feds all over. Jimmy, it was... it was a mess. - You better get off the line, Jimmy. - Sidney. - If they've got a tap on that line... - Sidney, shut your fucking mouth. Now, listen to me, dummy. Do they have Mardukas in custody or not? I don't... I don't... Jimmy, I don't know. The cops were swarming all over the place. We couldn't see anything. Let me tell you two stupid motherfuckers something. I don't want to get another phone call like this because if I do... I'm gonna get on a fucking plane and blowtorch the both of you. Do you understand? I'm on the phone, I'm talking to Jimmy. What are you doing? I should have killed Walsh in Chicago a long time ago. Don't say a word to me, Sidney. Don't say a fucking word to me. I'll get up and I'll bury this telephone in your head. I can't believe this. I haven't seen either of them in nine years and the first thing out of my mouth is gonna be, "Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?" I have a feeling this is gonna be very good for you. You look fine. Who are you guys? I'm your mother's ex-husband. Mum! Nice kid! Hi, Gail. Hello. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Hi. They mentioned you and him on the news this morning. - They did? - Yeah. What did they say? Anything good? No. Are you all right? Yeah. You're in a lot of trouble, Jack. Can I come in for a few minutes, Gail? Can I come in for a few minutes? Yeah. I won't stay long. I just need to borrow some money to get to LA. You know I'm good for it. Jack, I don't think I have that kind of cash in the house. I'm so embarrassed, I... I'm just in a jam, Gail. You look beautiful. You don't look much like a criminal. I'm a white-collar criminal. Jason, go upstairs now. Jack, you shouldn't be here. If Ted comes home, he's going to arrest you and him. - Arrest us? - Yeah. Then we'd really be in a lot of trouble cos I'm afraid I'm a little short of bribe money. All right, Jack. Don't start, please, don't. How is Lieutenant Whatever-His-Name-Is? - He's captain now. - Oh, Captain. Royalty. Jack, I don't want any trouble. Do you understand that, please? It is not a good day for this. I mean it. Well, I'm sorry that my fugitive timetable doesn't coincide with your social calendar. - I don't think she was saying that. - Just stay out of this. Same old Jack. You get your feelings hurt, then you just walk around and hurt everybody else's. The last thing I need is one of your lectures. I'm not lecturing you, stupid. I'm trying to protect you. - Come on! - Ted will be home any minute. We're all going out. It's an important night for us. Important night? What's so important about tonight? Let me guess. Is it payoff night? All right, that's it. Get out. Listen, I'm in a big fucking jam. I just need to borrow some money so I can get this guy back to LA and I'm out of this miserable fucking business for ever. Can't you understand that? Hi. Denise? You got so big. Ah... I'm sorry. I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry. No. Hold on. I'm sorry, honey, I'm just... We're having a... What grade are you in now? Eighth. Are you in the eighth grade? There's $40. It's all I've got. But these are the keys to my car. It's the station wagon in the driveway. - I'll tell Ted that it's in the shop. - OK. And worry about when you get back to LA. So does he take good care of you? Yeah? That's all I want to know. So what's he going to say about this? He'll understand. That's love, you know. Bye, honey. Wait! It isn't much. About $180 babysitting money. - Sweetheart, I can't. - Take it. Please. - I can't, sweetheart. - Take it. Hello, I'd like to make a collect call to an Eddie Moscone from a Jack Walsh. Moscone Bail Bonds. Jerry, Jack. Put Eddie on the phone. Eddie, it's Jack. Jack, stop fucking around. Where are you? Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho. No, no, no, wait a minute. I'm in Anchorage, Alaska. No, no, no, wait. I'm in Casper, Wyoming. I'm in the lobby of a Howard Johnson's and I'm wearing a pink carnation. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the other guys. What other guys? Let me describe the scene to you. There's these guys, see? They've probably been up for like two days. They stink of BO. They have coffee breath. They're constipated from sitting on their asses for so long. They're sitting in a van, probably parked right up the street from your office. But now, you guys, you're gonna have to pack up all your shit and go home because I'm onto you, you dumb fucks. Eddie, your phone is tapped. Listen, I'm not going to use this line any more. Go to Chin Loo's. I'll call there in five minutes. They can't run a tap that fast. So long, everybody! Excuse me, don't an... I got it! I got it. I think it's for me. Jack, that you? Listen, I need you to wire me 500 to the Western Union office in Amarillo, Texas right away. Wait a minute. What do you need with $500 on a bus? And why the fuck aren't you on a plane? Did it ever occur to you that I am a professional and I might have my reasons? We are driving now and I only have enough cash to get to Amarillo. We had to scrap the bus. Fuck the bus! I want to know what happened to the goddamn plane! He doesn't like to fly. He doesn't like to fly? What the fuck does that mean? Listen to me, Jack. You gotta be back here in less than two and a half fucking days. A half million dollars of my money. What the fuck is going on here? Eddie, I swear to God, don't start with me now or I will shoot him and I will dump him in a fucking swamp. I am in no fucking mood for this. Just send me the money. I'll have him back by the deadline. - You hear me? - Yes. Let's go. Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh in Amarillo, Texas right away. Amarillo, Texas. Now, listen also... Get Dorfler down here. Find him and get him down here too. You got it, Eddie. Shit! *... one of those bottles of beer should fall * 96 bottles of beer on the wall * 96 bottles of beer on the wall * ba-ba-boom * ba-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da boom * Nine... * 93 bottles of beer on the wall... * Why were you so unpopular with the Chicago Police Department? Cos of your personality? What happened back at your house? What was that all about? Your wife married a corrupt police officer? What was it all about? That whole fucking department was corrupt. There's good and bad everywhere, don't you think? I'd say there was bad everywhere. Good I don't know about. What happened to you? I wouldn't go on the payroll. What payroll? I was working undercover. I was... ...close to this guy, this big heroin dealer in Chicago. He supplied the whole city. Took a year just to get his confidence. Just when I was about to nail the son of a bitch, my fellow officers... mysteriously discovered seven pounds of heroin in my house. So this big time drug dealer gave me a choice. Get on the payroll like everybody else, get out of town or go to jail for 30 years. Well, I didn't get on the payroll. That's why I do this. When I find a criminal like you, I bring him in. I don't have to worry about anybody taking a payoff because there is no "anybody". There's just me. Why don't you get yourself a new watch? I'll tell you when I know you better. When are you going to get to know me better? I'll get to know you better. Exactly. Will you shut up? That's what I mean. How much money do we have left? - That's it? - That's it. We're starving and you're buying cigarettes? I need these cigarettes. You can have whatever you're gonna have. I'll have this. What can I do for you boys? Coffee, please. How much is the coffee? It's 53 cents. - How much is tea? - 53 cents. I'll have tea. OK, and our breakfast special today is chorizo and eggs. Chorizo and eggs? - Chorizo and eggs, yes. - What is that? It's a Mexican sausage mixed in with scrambled eggs. It comes with hash browns and toast. We won't be having that, thank you. What time you got? Ten till nine. All right. In ten minutes we'll be at the Western Union office. We'll have 500 bucks. I'll buy you a nice juicy steak or whatever you want, OK? Chorizo and eggs. Chorizo and eggs. I'll get you whatever you want. You know, Jon, you're in this mess because you're in this mess. I didn't put you in this mess. You understand? Yeah. If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone, this wouldn't be happening. Thank you. Thank you. I had a way outta this, you know. Oh yeah? What's the thing Serrano's most afraid of? Going cross country with you. Gettin' knocked off by his own people. What I know about his financial transactions can not only put him away but every mob guy he ever did business with. That's why he wants to kill me. I was going to put all his records on computer disks. I figured if things got too rough I could always trade them for my own life. So what happened? What happened was I got arrested before I got a chance to do it. Why didn't you just leave him alone? You don't look like the kind of guy who would be involved in that sort... Why didn't you just leave that heroin dealer alone? I was a mob accountant. I thought I worked at a legitimate firm. When I found out I was managing accounts that were fronts for Serrano, I couldn't just sit back and do nothing. Yeah, but, Jon, you still took what didn't belong to you. - How can you be on the side of a mobster? - I'm not on the side of a mobster. You're on his side if you're not on mine. I'm not on anybody's side. I got nothing to do with it. You got everything to do with it. You're taking me to jail and you know I'll be killed. That's not my problem. Oh, it's not your problem? It's not your problem? D'you read about me in the papers? Yeah, I did. - Were you on my side then? - Yeah, I was. Then why aren't you now? Because now you're in my way. In your way? What you mean is you want the money for turning me in because that's all you're about. You're just about the fuckin' money. Well, Jon, you can think whatever you wanna think. Doesn't matter to me because I'm getting my $100,000 any which way you want it. Let's go. Hey, Tony! Tony! Hop-along Cassidich. You got your camera - take a picture. Come on! They got these at the airport. Shall I get one on the way back? Come on, put that away. I'm not gonna tell you again. Tony, there they are. - How're you doin', Jack? - Oh shit! Jimmy sends his regards. Don't worry, Jack. We're not here for you. We're here for him. What are you staring at? You gonna propose? Drop 'em! I said drop 'em, assholes! Who the fuck are you guys? Who the fuck are you? You're dead. You know who you're fuckin' with? No. Why don't you tell me about it? Make sure you speak into the microphone. Marvin! Marvin! Very clever, Jack. Now give me the keys. Come on! Give me the keys. Keys. Looks like a package deal to me, Marvin. Goddammit! Come on, both of you. Who the hell were those guys? Oh, Marvin, you did it this time. What are you talkin' about? Those are hired killers back there. - Hired to kill who? - Hired to kill this guy. - Me. Me - can you believe it? - Hired by who? Hired by who? Jimmy Serrano - that's who. Oh fuck! Why do they wanna kill this guy? Don't you read the papers, Knucklehead? - Yeah, I read the fuckin' papers. - I can't take this. They got away. Grey dodge. Get after 'em. How the fuck did you know where we were? Shut up a minute. Did Eddie put you on this? Of course Eddie put me on this. Son of a bitch! You know I have a contract with him? - Got a contract? - Yeah, signed it on Monday. He called me in Pittsburgh. He said you were fucking this thing up. I'm not fucking anything up. You should've been in LA two days ago. Marvin, don't tell me how to do my goddamn job. I'm half thinking not to turn him in just to watch Eddie go down the fucking toilet. - See, that's a good thought. - What? - Who the hell's talkin' to you? - Yeah, who the fuck's talkin' to you? He's not yours to take any more, whip dick, he's mine. Did you hear that? Fuck! Who the fuck is this? Jesus Christ! Do something! You guys are the dumbest bounty hunters I've ever seen. You couldn't even deliver a bottle of milk! - You are the worst... - Will you shut the fuck up? Where the hell did he go? You think we lost him? I don't know. I don't see anything. Oh, I'm sure we're completely safe - You all right? - Yeah, fine. I'm enjoying it. Marvin. Marvin, give me your gun. No fuckin' way. - Give me a fuckin' gun. - Give him a gun, Marvin. Don't fuck me, Jack. Yeah, yeah. Shit. They're not after me. Just kidding! Just kidding! Thought you threw those away. Always check the evidence, Marvin. Those were car keys. Son of a bitch! There goes 100 grand. 100? Eddie was going to pay you 100? - Why? What was he going to pay you? - 25. Oh. Son of a bitch. Holy shit, Jack! You got him! Marvin! What the hell are you doin', Jack? See you in LA, Marvin. Jon! Jon! Jon! Where the fuck are you, Jon? Give me your hand. I'm slipping, I can't hold on. Give me your hand. Where you going? Jon! Jon! Good. Promise to let me go? You promise to let me go? Fuck you! - Promise to let me go. - Fuck you! You're making it very difficult for me to do the right thing here. Yeah, all right. I promise I'll let you go. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks for saving my life. Thanks for letting me go. I'll let you go all right. The second you're in LA County Jail. Come on. That's right - down here. You gonna stand there with your thumb up your ass or are you gonna get me the fuck outta here? This just came in. This gonna upset me? I think it's safe to say that. Are you familiar with a dish, of a potato dish, Lyonnaise potato? It's a kind of fried potato and it's got like an onion in it. It's quite delicious. It really goes beautifully with steak, chops, hamburger, cheeseburger, any of your meat dishes. It's just... You know, I have enough money to buy... - Look. - ... as much Lyonnaise potato... Just shut the fuck up, will you? ...as you would enjoy, and I think you ought to think about it a little bit because nothing... Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Cover that. Hi. You think you could give us a ride to the next town? - Sure. Jump in the back. - Thanks a lot. Great! See, for every shit, there's six nice people. Yeah, hey, everyone! Yeah, hey! What's that? It's hello. I can say hello in a lot of different languages. Not yours, but a lot of them. Welcome, sir. I'm not looking forward to this. What do you think, I am? Don't understand the problem with you two. The guy's a fucking accountant. It was bad luck right down the line. This guy Walsh is pretty good. If he's that good, Tony, maybe I should hire him to hit you. I hope there's no chance of any of this coming back to Jimmy. No chance. We rented a chopper out of Kansas City. It's five times removed from here, so you're clear of this - don't worry. - You fucking moron! - Hey, Jimmy. The guy is still out there, ain't he? Let me tell you two guys something. I'm not interested in seeing either one of you two alive again until you get the accountant. You got the message? This is the end of the ride. - This is it? - This is it. Is there a real town around here some place? Channings. - Channings? - Yeah. How far is that from here? - 30 miles. - 30 miles. Oh, Jesus Christ! What the hell kind of town is this? Is there someone that can give us a ride to Channing? - Is there anyone going in that direction? - No. No have a ride. Excuse me. Is there a bathroom in there I could use? - Bathroom? - Yeah, go ahead. Is there a telephone here? - Telephone? - No. No telephone. No telephone? Nothing? Glad you're having a good time. Fear of flying, you son of a bitch! Get over here. Get back here, you son of a bitch! Get over here. Stop! Stop! Fear of flying, my ass, you son of a bitch. Get out of that plane. You're a goddamn pilot, you son of a bitch? I didn't think it was appropriate to share that with you, Jack. I'm gonna fuckin' appropriate your head. How do you turn this fuckin' thing off? Turn it off! Turn it off! Hang in there. I'm gonna let it down easy. How do you turn that fuckin' thing off? Oh shit! I didn't know you were a goddamn pilot! You're a pilot? I'll show you pilot. Let me tell you about the coffee shop I'm gonna open after I dump you off and get my 100 grand. You're gonna love it. All right, get back. Get back! Get back, everybody, get back. Give me the keys to the truck. - You can't steal their truck. - Shut up. - You were about to steal a plane. - I was trying to save my life. You're right. I should give them something. Give me your watch. - My watch? Shit! - Give me your watch. Take it. It's worth a lot of money. Get in. Get back. Get in. Get in. Jack, let's be fair about this. You lied to me first. - At the river. - What? - At the river, before... - Oh, get the... - At the river... - You lied to me first. You got some fuckin' nerve. No, you lied to me first. You lied to me first. Yes, yes, I lied to you first but you had no knowledge I was lying about my fear of flying at the river, when you lied to me, so as far as you knew, you lied to me first. I can't even argue with you. I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. I'm just saying you lied to me first as far as you knew. - What's the matter? - I got an ulcer. - An ulcer? - Yeah, I got an ulcer. A big fucking ulcer. All your bullshit is starting to make it bleed again. You know why you have an ulcer? Cos you have two forms of expression. Silence and rage. You should get some milk to coat it. Don't tell me what I need. I need something to eat, that's what. What are we going to buy it with? Dirt? You drive to the next town. I'll take care of it. You'll take care of it? What do you mean? Drive to the next town. But you lied to me first. - Now what? - Give me that FBl badge. The FBl badge? Yeah, give me the FBl badge. - Uncuff me. - Uncuff you? Uncuff me. You wanna eat? A nice meal? Want some of that shit you eat? Come on. Uncuff me. You fuck with me... You'll hit me on the head and drop me in a... thing, right. Uncuff me. - Who's in charge here? - Who wants to know? Me. That'll be the manager. I'd like to see the manager as soon as possible. Yes, sir. Sorry. Yeah? Alonzo Mosely, FBl. My partner and I have been tracking a ring of counterfeiters passing phoney $20 bills across the state. Have you received any $20 bills in the last couple of hours? Yeah, sure, we get 'em all the time. You get 'em all the time. Would you mind taking two steps backwards? Would you mind opening the register? No, don't touch them. Excuse me. Contract two, Hank. Check 'em out. Give him a pencil, please. Do litmus configuration. You doing the litmus configuration? - Litmus configuration. - Yes. You seen any suspicious-looking characters around here? No. Do you live around here? Yeah. Mmmm. - How's it look? - This one's bad. Would you describe exactly what the last man who passed a $20 bill to you looked like? 30, tall. - About six feet tall? - Six-five. - Dark brown hair? - Light coloured. - Sounds like our man. - That's him. We're gonna have to take these bills for evidence. Make up a receipt. - This one's bad too. - This one's bad too. I'd like you to notify all the other establishments in the area. - What's the name of your establishment? - Red's Corner Bar. - Are you Red? - Yes, sir. You dye your hair? No. Why do they call you Red? Oh, it's short for Red Wood. My last name's Wood. - What's your first name? - Bill. Thank you for your cooperation, Bill. Hank. These are all bad. Those are good. - Come on. We're gonna get this train. - What? We're gonna catch this train. Come on. I can't catch a train. You also couldn't fly. Start running. Let's go. Wait! It's a freight train. I can't do this! I can't do this! I deeply feel I can't do this. You love to travel by train. Get up there. What are you doing? You promise to let me go? Open the fucking door! See you in the next life, Jack. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Open the fucking door! Glad to see me? I guess we're in the next life, Jon. - Don't overreact, Jack. - Don't overreact? I won't overreact. Get over here. Overreact? You do this again, I'll throw you outta the fucking train! - Jack, it's a bad... - Get down there! All right, all right, Jack. Easy, Jack. Easy, easy! You son of a bitch! Jack. You shut up! I'm not talking to you for the whole rest of this journey. Are you guys gonna let me go, or what? I'm telling you, I don't know anything. Is that a fact? Oh shit! Why don't you quit? It'd be cheaper for both of us. Where are they? You got me. Inspector... Shut up! Now, you listen, you son of a bitch. I want answers and I want them right now. What do you want from me? I don't know nothing. Sir. It seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely and his partner were seen hopping a westbound freight train in Channing. Come on. Jack? What? How much further do you think we have to go? None of your fucking business! Because, eventually, I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom. Shut the fuck up! D'you ever have sex with an animal, Jack? Remember those chickens around the Indian reservation? There were some good-looking chickens there, Jack. You know, between us. Yeah, there were a couple there I might have taken a shot at. What's with you and that watch? What is it with the watch? You told me when you got to know me better, you told me about your feelings for chickens, how private could the watch be? What's the big secret? Gail bought me this watch. She gave it to me. It was the first thing she ever gave me. She, er... She bought it because I was always late. At least half an hour or so. She bought it and set it ahead half an hour so I'd never be late. Somewhere in the back of my mind I keep thinking we're gonna wind up together. I don't know why I'm still hanging on, still waiting around. I don't think she's coming back. Yeah, I don't either. I don't either. Sometimes you just have to let go. Just get yourself a new watch. You're OK, Jack. I think... ...under different circumstances... ...you and I... ...probably still would've hated each other. We probably could've been friends. In the next life. Yeah, the next life. Yeah, great. Accommodations were wonderful. You got a smoke? Don't smoke. The fed took my cigarettes. You want your cigarettes back? Then you're gonna have to go to Flagstaff to get them. Cos that's where your pal Mosely went. Just might do that. Where d'you figure we are? My guess would be Arizona. We've been going west all night. Think we're almost home. I'm almost dead. Hey, look, Jon, the witness protection programme isn't so bad. They'll give you a new name, you'll have a new life. I'm not gonna make it to any witness protection programme. - You don't know that, Jon. - I know that. You know that. Serrano's going to get to me before I get to any witness protection programme. Do me a favour. Don't pretend you care about me. It really insults my intelligence. I mean, let's face it, the only important thing about me to you is getting your money. You know, I'm really tired of you making me out to be some kind of thug whose only concern is a big chunk of change. Did you know that Serrano's people offered me a million bucks for you? Why don't you go for the big money? You're doing his work for him anyway. Working for him anyway? You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. The reason I do this shit in the first place is because I wouldn't work for that low-life asshole. What does that mean? Nothing. Doesn't mean anything. Serrano is the heroin dealer you told me about in Chicago? Who owned your buddies and destroyed your life? That's Serrano? That's the guy that you're taking me into? That's the guy that's gonna kill me? Hope it's a wonderful coffee shop, Jack. Come on. - What? - We're gettin' off. What? We are getting off here, Mr Railroad Man. Come on. What? What? No! Come on! What are you talking about? Come on! Let's discuss this. - Find anything? - Not yet. They could have jumped off the train anywhere along the line. See, trains have regularly scheduled stops. The reason for that is cos people plan to get off the trains when they stop. And that's how generally people do it. They don't, like... throw each other off trains. That's the purpose of having stops. What's this? What are you gonna do? What are you doing now? What are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, Christ! Christ! Come on! You kidding? Probably come out and shoot us, for Christ's sake. What the hell? What the hell? Jesus! Oh, great! You get it started. And I'll run you over. That's the best plan I can think of. Congratulations! Congratulations. - Another crime. - Come on! I don't like this. I don't like anything you do, to tell you the truth. Nothing. Where are we going? The nearest airport. Not the kind of guy that says, "I told you so. " Oh, shit! Looks like they've been spotted around 35 miles south of here near Sedona. There are officers in pursuit. Let's take the chopper. This is... This is the kind of situation where something bad happens. Easy! Goddammit, I don't like this. Truck! Truck! Where are we going, Jack? We'll find out when we get there. I've come too far. Too far. I'm too close. Hey, I'm coming. All right. - Come on. - Right. Here we go. Hello! Hello! Oh! Am I lucky or am I just good? Is that Marvin? Fucking am the best. Marvin? Hello, Jack. You dumb shit! Come on, you pain in the ass. Wait a minute. You move I'll tear your fucking limbs out. - See you in LA, Jack. - You... Sh-sh-sh-shit! - Afternoon, sir. - Afternoon. You're open? Oh, we're always open. Hard day? Hard week. Yeah, I know what you mean. Could use a cup of coffee. Yes, sir. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Keep 'em. Gee! I've been looking all over for these. Thanks, Alonzo. Marvin, I have to tell you, I have this very serious fear of flying. Yeah? Well, why don't you just relax and sleep through it? Forget your deadline, Walsh. It's over. That's the way that one went. I know my rights. You owe me phone calls. What should be of paramount importance to you right now is not phone calls. It's that you're going to spend ten years for impersonating a federal agent. - Ten years for impersonating a fed? - Ten years. Ten years. How come no-one's after you? - Give this guy his calls. - Thanks. Have a little privacy, please? Moscone Bail Bonds. It's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on. It's Jack. Yeah. This better be good news, fucking Jack, because you got five hours left. No, it's not Eddie. I'm calling to let you know you're a dead motherfucker, you understand me? Wait a minute. You put Marvin on this case, you fucking piece of shit. You fucking deceptive... - you vermin... - You fucking done yet? You slimeball in a sea of pus... - Jack, you blew it. - What? You blew it. All right? You had the guy four fucking days, Jack. Four days! You could've walked here backwards and not fucking blown it, but you blew it. When have I ever fu...? When have I ever let you down? You fucking rat! Are you fucking nuts, telling Dorfler I offered you $100,000, when I told him I'd give him 25? - Wait. When did you speak to him? - What's the difference? When did you speak to Marvin? He called me fucking, what, ten minutes ago, yelling and screaming, telling me to go fuck myself. You're telling me, everybody's telling me to go fuck myself. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Eddie, Eddie, what are you fucking talking about? Look, you got five hours left. Can you bring the fucking Duke in, yes or no? I thought he's bringing him to you. I just talked to fucking Dorfler. He don't have The Duke. - What? - Where's the fucking Duke? - Hello? - I'll talk to you later. Jack! - Hello? - Is Tony Darvo there, please? Who's calling? Marvin Dorfler. Yo. I got Marvin Dorfler on the line. Shall I put him through? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put him through. Marvin. Everything's still on schedule, isn't it? So Dorfler's working for you guys. - Who is this? - This is Jack Walsh. Jack, what are you complaining for? We came to you first, didn't we? It's Jack Walsh. Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello. Hey! Too late for you, scumbag. No, no, no. Too late for you. I didn't come this far not to collect my money. You understand me, you motherfuckers? I want The Duke back. What the fuck you telling me for? What am I telling you for? What am I telling you for. I tell you what I'm telling you for. I got some of The Duke's belongings, that's why, including some computer disks that have every last detail of Serrano's businesses and his money laundering operations - everything. And if I don't get The Duke back in the next two hours, I'm going to turn those disks over to the feds, d'you hear me? You tell Serrano I want to meet him with The Duke alone in two hours in the main terminal of McCarran Airport where we'll make the exchange. He's the only one of you fucking idiots who won't try to take a shot at me in a public place. If I see one fucking single goon within a mile of that airport - and listen to me very carefully - the deal is off and I'm going to the feds. I ain't gonna bother Jimmy with your bullshit. You're not? OK, fine. After he's busted I'll make sure to let him know you knew all about it beforehand. That's two hours from now, main terminal McCarran Airport. You got that, moron? Have a nice day. Tell Alonzo I want to make a deal. You wanna make a deal with me? What would you do if I could deliver you Serrano? What do you mean "deliver"? For starters, conspiracy to destroy government evidence. What government evidence? Will you let me take The Duke back myself and collect my money? Tell me more. I'll have to tell you on the way cos we gotta be in Las Vegas in two hours. Marvin? Marvin? No, it's room service. Here. Hold this up, so they know we took this today. I amaze myself - I'm always thinking. Got it all figured out. Now, say "cheese". Don't do this, Marvin. Adios! Right, there are no real computer disks. - Is that right? - Right. So if you give him blank disks and he accepts them, would that still be considered an overt act? If he just sets foot inside the airport he's committed an overt act, conspiracy to obstruct justice. When he shows up with The Duke you add kidnapping. Anybody packing a gun, conspiracy to commit murder. The fact that it's an airport - Alonzo, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't want to step on your toes - you can slap an interstate transportation in aid of racketeering rap on him as well. Yeah, well, none of that bullshit means anything unless you can get him to take those disks from you. Don't worry. I'll get him to take the disks. Get a wire on this man. Marvin? No hard feelings about what happened back in Amarillo? Just one of those... spur of the moment deals, you know? - Where is he? - Where's the money? In the car. Where is he? Slight change of plans. Now I want two million. - What? - I read the newspapers, you know. The guy got you for $15 million, right? So I figure he's got to be worth at least two. I'm a businessman. How do we know you got him? I want one million now, then I'll call you in 20 minutes, tell you where to drop off the second million. Once I know it's there, then I'll tell you where he is. OK? - Not OK. - Why not? What? Are you fucking nuts? What's Jimmy gonna say? How the fuck are we gonna get The Duke now? - You got the answer right in your hands. - What are you talking about? Joey, when are you gonna pay attention? Look. See what it says there? All right. This is it. Tonight is the fucking night, you understand? I'm sick of all these screw-ups. As soon as I get the disks from Walsh, you guys drop Walsh and you drop The Duke. Do you understand? I get the disks, you drop them, OK? I don't think you should do this. Oh, really? What do you propose that I do? Send somebody with a cash offer but don't do this. I know Walsh. He won't take any money from me. He's a very self-righteous type of guy. It aggravates me. In his mind this is clean. He gets what he wants, I get what I want. The guy's a fucking burn-out, Sidney. - Jimmy, listen to me... - Sit down, relax, have a sandwich. Drink a glass of milk. Do some fucking thing, will you? He's on his way. He's heading north on Las Vegas Boulevard approximately two miles from the airport. We're right on him. Why are you smiling? I feel like a cop again. So I'm finally in the presence of greatness? The Duke. The guy that steals money from the scum of the earth and gives it to the unfortunates of the world. I wanted to meet you face to face. Did you actually think that you were going to steal my money, and get away with it? I stopped by here to tell you two things. Number one is that you're going to die tonight. Number two - I'm gonna go home, have a nice hot meal. I'm gonna find your wife and I'm gonna kill her too. Joey, wait here for my car. The rest of you start heading in. You got it. Here he comes. Jack. Long time no see. Long time no see. I see you're still spending all your money on clothes. You know. Listen, while you're in town, if you wanna go see a show, or you want a free meal or something like that, you just let me know. On me - that's the type of guy I am. - You're a real sport. - Yeah. Just give him the disks. How's your mother? She's all right. Your daughter's getting big? All grown up? You know, I was thinking, maybe if we'd done business way back when, you wouldn't look like a guy with a fucking cup in your hand. I'm trying to make a living. Listen, Jack, you got those disks? Or did you lose them like you lost your job? Give him the disks, Walsh. I see you but I don't see The Duke. - We'll worry about him in a minute. - No, we gotta worry about him now. Let me tell you something, Jimmy. This isn't a reunion. If I don't see The Duke in about five seconds, I'm walking. You know, you're still way too serious, really. Listen, why don't you just hand over the tapes? We'll take a walk, get the guy together. Fuck you. I'll see you at the arraignment. Hey, Jack. Jack! Hey! Where the hell is he going? - You win, all right? - I what? You won. What do you want me to do? Yell it all over this fucking airport? Where is he? - He's on his way. - You know, I said no goons. Never mind him. You're gonna get what you want. Didn't I just tell you that? This thing is going to give me a heart attack before it's all over. I know I'm gonna get a heart attack. Since we have this moment to share together, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Doesn't it bother you... ...that another cop is fucking your wife? Do you know they made this guy a captain? Can you imagine that? Go figure it out. Made him a captain. May I help you, sir? Yeah, give me a one-way ticket to LA. One way ticket to Los Angeles. Will that be smoking or non-smoking? Take a wild guess. Smoking. And how will you be paying for this, sir? Oh shit! - What is it? - Look. What the hell is he doing here? All right. We have a male Caucasian carrying a green duffel bag, his hands inside his vest, approaching the subjects. Get him out of there as quickly and as quietly as possible. Shoot him if you have to, but... get him out of here. - You OK, Jon? - Yeah. Stand behind me. It's all right. All right. Come on. - Hey! How's everybody doing? - Get outta here, Marvin. Back off, everybody, back off. Who the fuck are you? Are you writing a book? Who the fuck are you? - Who is this guy? - Jesus! Marvin, you're missing the bigger picture. Get outta here. - Take a fu... - Wire's gone dead. - Are you crazy? - I didn't come all this way for nothing. Serrano's leaving. - Did he take the disks? - I don't know. - Serrano's got the disks. - Let him go, Jack. - Serrano's got the disks. - Did he or did he not take the disks? I couldn't tell. There was too much going on down there. Serrano's got the disks. He's got the disks. Marvin, Marvin, look out. - Marvin, Marvin, look out! - I'm not falling for that shit again. Marvin, look out. You stupid fuck, will you look out? Serrano's got the disks. Serrano's got the disks. Move in. - Don't move! - Let's get back! Take it easy! Come on! Goddammit! Who the fuck are you guys? Jimmy, there's something I've been wanting to say to you for ten years. Oh yeah? What's that? You're under arrest. We'll catch up with each other one of these days. Maybe we will. - We got our deal? - We got our deal. Hey! Wait a minute! What deal? Why the fuck does he get special treatment? See you in LA, Marvin. Watch your cigarettes with this guy, Jack. What's going on? Sorry, Jon. Got an hour and half to get you back to LA. Thanks, Alonzo. Yeah, Moscone Bail Bonds. - Hello, Eddie. - Yeah? Where's Jerry? Never mind Jerry. Where the hell are you, Jack? Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago. - Yeah? What for? - What's the difference, man? I never trusted that guy anyway. - Where the hell are you? - Where am I? I'm at the airport. Guess who I'm with! I'm with The Duke. You got him! You got him, Jack! I love you! Yeah, you wanna say hello? Yeah, put him on. - Yeah. Say hello. - Hello. Hello, you son of a bitch! We got you, - you son of a bitch. - Yeah. Now say goodbye, you lying little piece of shit, because I'm letting him go. Jack? It would've been a nice coffee shop. Oh, Jesus! Oh! I don't get it. I did what I wanted to do, Jon. I got you to LA before midnight, so... I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Or you'll make me wanna put those back on you again. Thanks. - No, Jon, thank you. - Thank you. Something to remember our adventure by. Jack. This better be good. This is good. This is very good. When I was making my getaway, I thought the FBl was closing in on me. Take it. Take it. I took some travelling money. Take it, take it. It's not a payoff. It's a gift. You already let me go. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Told you I had money. I know you had money, but I didn't know you had money. How much is here? Neighbourhood of 300,000. That's a very respectable neighbourhood. I don't know what to say, Jon. Take care. Take care. See you in the next life. See you in the next life. See you in the next life. - Do you know what time it is? - 25 to twelve. 25 to twelve. I would have made it. You wouldn't have change for 1,000, would you? What are you? A comedian? Get outta here, you bum! Looks like I'm walking.
