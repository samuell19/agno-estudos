He's behind you. - Behind you. Sorry. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Why do you have your panties in a twist? - I was in the library. - What for? What are you so happy about? Well, me and Rose are staying at Kaitlan's this weekend. What, are you 13? You're that excited about a slumber party? Kaitlan's mom is gonna be out of town. Some business trip or whatever. Your parents are okay with that? They don't know. Nice. So if you're not doing anything, come over. And bring Jeff. Okay. Okay. - Why Jeff? - Rose is asking. Got to go. Jeff. It's Shane. Listen, buddy, I think I know what you're gonna be doing tonight. I mean, sometimes they come as early as 7:00, so just put the trash bins out on Sunday night. My plane's scheduled to arrive at 10:15. I'll shoot you a text as soon as I'm there. - Okay, cool. - Okay? All right. And I know I don't need to say it, but no boys, no parties. - Okay? - Of course, Mom. Baby, just remember who you are, okay? Okay. The emergency credit card is behind the coffee and the tea. It's emergencies only, okay? And here you go. Wait, this is for you. - Okay? - Thanks. Okay. Your friends, Jenna and what's her name again? - Rose. - Rose. If they want to come over, that's fine, but... - No boys. All right. - Good job. - I love you. - I love you. Have a safe trip. You look really pretty. Thank you, baby. I love you. I love you, too. Thank you, sir. Be good, hon. Bye, Mom. - Stop. - What? The cab's barely around the corner. So is Shane gonna come over? You mean with Jeff? Come on, let's go. Hey, guys. - Whoa. - What? Nice house. Yeah, my mom's got a good job. All right, snap out of it, sunshine. - You guys hungry? - Yes. I am starving. We should order some pizza or something. Pizza sounds great. I'm down. Okay, thanks. Done, one cheese, one pepperoni, 30 minutes. This is just another bathroom, but we're not supposed to use it because of the plumbing. All right. My dad says college is a waste of time. - God, you're so lucky. - Why? My mom thinks that college is like the end all, be all. Whatever. She just got offered a track scholarship to Trinity. Yeah, that's right, you run. That's right. I'm so over it. Pizza. Do you have some money to throw in for the pizza? - Yeah. - Sweet. Awesome. - Yay. - Sweet, pizza. Smells good. I'm so hungry. All right, I'm gonna put it here. I swear sometimes I just... I want to, like, join the Peace Corps or, like, move to Mumbai or something. Wait, where is Mumbai? It's really far away from here. Hey, where's your mom's liquor cabinet? Jenna, no, okay? Like, if my mom even notices, I'm gonna be in college till I'm 70. Shut the fuck up. - What? - Can you turn that down? - What's wrong? - Listen. - But... - Shh! Shit. - I almost had a heart attack. - Whatever. Ladies and gentlemen, I present refreshments. - Why, thank you very much. - Is that beer? No, it's fucking ginger ale. Yeah, it's beer. Come on. Look, Jenna, this is not okay, okay? My mom is gonna kill me. Like, literally kill me. You weren't supposed to tell anyone. Well, let's just have some fun. Here, put this in the fridge. Yeah? Please? I'll love you forever. See, I always thought of myself as more the Clark Gable type. Shit. Guys, guys. Guys, my mom is calling. - Shut up, okay? - All right, relax. - Please be quiet. - Ooh! Shh! Hey, Mom. Nothing. I'm just watching TV right now. I'm thinking about going to bed early. No, actually. Jenna couldn't come over tonight. I think she's gonna end up coming... um, over tomorrow. - Yes. All righty, Mom. I love you. Okay. I love you, too. Bye. My God. Mom phone call, over. - Cheers. - All right, all right. - Cheers. - Cheers. To Mom being out of town. And they go upstairs. And there's this girl. She's just freaking out on the floor. On the floor. It was creepy. I've seen that video. It's a hoax. It's definitely a hoax. - We all know it's a hoax. - What's it called? "The Midnight Game." Why would anybody play that? For fun. It's a pagan ritual. It's designed to teach you how to follow the rules. If you don't follow the rules, then you get punished. So, wait. If you don't relight your candle and... what's the other thing? Right, or surround yourself in a circle of salt. If you don't do those things, then you'll hallucinate. Cool. Like an acid trip? Yeah, no, it's more like you hallucinate your worst fears. Only until 3:33 A.M. And then what? I don't know. You go home. You go to bed. You take a crap. Whatever. So basically I just feel like I'm falling for a couple hours? What? Well, I mean, it's your worst fears, right? And I've kind of always had this phobia about heights. Like, my mom tried to take me to the Grand Canyon once and I, like, couldn't even get near the edge. It was horrible. The whole trip really sucked. Guess I'd be seeing ghosts all night. Ghosts? Really? I saw one once when I was 10. I was staying at my grandmother's in upstate New York. Your house kind of reminds me of hers. So old and moldy? No, I just kept hearing footsteps every night. And I thought it was, like, my parents or something. But, well, then I got up and I saw this old guy walking down the stairs. You mean your grandfather? No, he died two years before. But it wasn't his ghost. No, I found out the original owner, he, like, killed himself or something in 1915. I think it was him. It freaked me the fuck out. What about you? You mean, like what am I afraid of? Um... I don't know, really. Going insane. Fuck, no. I'm not... no. I'm not insane and I don't plan on going insane, so... No, I mean that's my worst fear. You should probably change it 'cause you kind of already are. Yeah. Bitch. My aunt just flipped out a few years ago. They institutionalized her. I guess she thought everyone was out to kill her or something. Claustrophobia for me. Probably. Definitely. Yeah, claustrophobia. I hate small spaces. Like, if I got stuck in an elevator or something, I'd go batshit crazy. Like, fucking climb the elevator shaft or something. It's 'cause you're so big. - Not like that. - He's got a big shaft. - Wow. - So what about you? - Me? - Yeah, you. - I... Me? I don't know. I'd have to think about it. I'd have to think about it. Because you're just so tough, you have no fears, is that it? No, asshole, that's not what I'm saying. - Not one fear for Shane? - I'm just saying, I'd have... I think he's just a little embarrassed to tell us what it is. Yeah, that's what it is, I'm just embarrassed to tell you what it is. All right. All right. I've got to go. - You're not gonna play the game? - It's 11:30. Yeah, I know. That's perfect. We got just enough time to set up. I got practice tomorrow at 10:30. I told you. Okay, we'll be in bed by 4:00. Tell that to my parents, dude. All right, just tell your parents that you're staying at my place. Come on, what do you say? Guys, I don't know about this. Yeah, I'm kind of scared. Isn't that the whole point? What do we need? Gather round, Girl Scouts, 'cause when are you ever gonna have another opportunity like this? Does anybody have a pin? You know, like a needle. - Does it matter if it's kosher? - I'm sure that's fine. - Pin! - Yeah, I got it. Hold on. Okay, what is this for? Okay, so after we write our names on the pieces of paper, we... ...we add a drop of our own blood. - What? No. No fucking way. - That is really gross. That's the rules. Okay. - Such a pyro. - Shut up. All right, check it out. Like a man. Gross. Who's next? Come on, we've got five minutes. - All right, fine. - Do we have to do it? Kaitlan, your front door is made out of wood, right? - Yeah. - Okay, cool. Kaitlan, hurry. Close the door. - Okay. - All right, now what? Now we put our pieces of paper down here. Okay. Now we light our candles. - Jeff, what time is it? - 11:59. Great. Everyone bring your candles here. Jenna! - You have to use a match. - Please. Jeff, time. 11:59 and 34... 35 seconds. Perfect. Okay. Now, I'm gonna knock 22 times on the door. And on the 22nd time, it has to be midnight exactly. - All right. - Yeah? - Go now. - Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Holy shit, that was perfect. Now what? Now we blow out our candles and we go inside. We just summoned the Midnight Man. Get inside. Mwa-ha-ha. All right. Now we light our candles again. Okay. What the fuck is the Midnight Man anyway? Yeah, you didn't say anything about that. Yeah, who is the Midnight Man? I didn't? Well, that's the whole point. The Midnight Man is the guy that haunts you with your own worst fears. Ooh, creepy. Yeah, well, only if he gets you. Well, how does he catch you? All right, listen up. From here on out, we go with just the candles. Now, if your candle goes out, that means the Midnight Man's found you. Shit. You then have 10 seconds to relight your candle. Now, if you don't relight your candle in 10 seconds, that's where the salt comes in. How? You surround yourself in a circle of salt and you stay inside until 3:33 A.M. What if you don't? That's when the Midnight Man fucks your head to pieces. Okay, I am getting more matches. Hell, yeah. Me, too. - I fucking love this game. - Right, man? I'm putting a big old circle of salt around my ass. Is there any rules about drinking or what? - No. - Sweet. - Who wants a beer? - Hit me. - You've been hit. Anybody? - I'm good. Hey, you want to go explore upstairs? Sure, why not? What? Nothing. What? - Come here. - What? - Come here. That door always does that. It's so drafty up there. Well, what is up there? Nothing, really. It's just an attic. I don't know, I don't really like going up there much. My dad used to sleep up there when my parents were getting a divorce, so there's just, like, a lot of bad energy up there. Hey, so can we please power up the microwave for, like, three minutes? I'm really craving some popcorn. I'm not going to break the rules. Stop. Ooh, hello there. Hey, guys. Whatcha doing down there? Sorry to interrupt. There's no way I'm holding this thing all night. Honestly, this is getting kind of old. What time is it? It is 1:20 A.M. Great, only another two hours and 13 minutes to go. Have you ever actually done this before? No. Some cousins told me about it. And some friends of theirs, they did it last summer. And? Well, apparently they all came out alive. That's a relief. Yeah, but some freaky shit did happen. Like what? My God. - Whoa. Whoa. - Guys, come on, hurry up. Guys, hurry up. Come on, please. Shit, I just dropped all the matches. Three, two, one. Okay, you said 10 seconds. Was that more than 10 seconds? - That was under 10 seconds. - Jeff? Um, okay, it was like nine and a half seconds. - We're all good. - God, that was so freaky. - You didn't blow on it, did you? - No. Well, maybe there was a breeze or something when Jeff reached for his beer. - Holding my beer. - It was the Midnight Man. - Shh. Guys. Everybody shut up. - What? What is it? - Shh! Upstairs. I heard something. Well, this house is old. I mean, it does creak a lot. - It creaks like that? What the fuck was that? Okay, this is really weird. - Can we turn the lights back on? - No. No. Jeff, you and I, we are going to go upstairs and we are going to investigate this. You girls stay right here. We will beat the Midnight Man's ass for you girls, okay? Guys, seriously, don't fuck anything up. - My mom is gonna kill me. - Okay. What do you think that was? - You swear you didn't blow it out? - I swear. Shit. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. - Which way? - It's this way. - What the fuck? - Shit. What was that? You didn't fucking see that? No, I saw it. What was it? Shut the fuck up. Come on. What are you doing? There's probably someone in the fucking room. Yeah, it came from the fucking end of the hall. Kaitlan, what's in the room at the end of the hall? It's just a guest bedroom. - You guys see anything? - Not... not yet. - I'm going downstairs. - No, let's fucking check it out. - I'm going downstairs. - Fuck. Shh, come here. What the fuck? - Shit. - Do you have matches? Yes, I have matches. You don't have matches? No, I don't have matches. Just light it, please. What the fuck did I tell you about matches? Six, seven, eight, nine, - 10, 11, 12. - Will you stop counting? Dude, that was way more than 10 seconds. Fuck it. I won't tell if you won't. Shit. What the fuck? Dude. Shane. - You don't think... that was just moved, do you? The footsteps. No. Then why is that off... Shit. Jenna! Hey, make sure your candle doesn't go out. What is it? Guys, there was somebody outside. He, like, stopped and looked in. - What did he look like? - We couldn't see. It was a dark shadow. I have no idea. - You still think this is boring? - Fuck you, asshole. I'm done with this. I'm turning the lights on. Stop! You can't. Says who? My God. You know what? Okay, I'm done. I'm done with this. - Did you unplug this? - No. Maybe the bulb's out. My God! My God! Please, someone relight... Rose, there's nothing wrong, okay? There's no boogeyman that's gonna jump out and hurt you. Listen to me, the rules are strict. All right, clearly some weird shit is happening. You guys are not gonna believe what Jeff and I found upstairs. What did you find? Nothing. No, what did you find? - Yeah, I was just kidding. - Seriously? The power's out. Um, I don't think so. Guys, it probably has batteries. Come on. - I think I just saw him again. - My God. Come on, motherfucker! You want some of this? - Dude, fucking look for him. It's just funny. You're yelling. Do you see anything? No. Let's go inside. Come on. - Whoa, hey, hey, hey. - Dude, fucking what? Hey, how weird was that cross? Don't talk about it, all right? I'm Catholic. That shit freaks me out. - Yeah, it's just weird, right? - No shit, it's weird. Fuck. This idea, bro, I really think you've outdone yourself with this one. I thought it'd be fun. I thought we'd get the girls a little excited and horny. - Yeah, me, too. Hey, shh. - Shh. Did you hear that? - Shut up. No. Did you hear that? I think I heard it from the woods. Maybe we should just go back inside. - Come on. - I'm going inside. Hey, but... Pussy. - Lock it. - Yeah. Lock the deadbolt. Got it. What do you think was out there? It's probably just a coyote. There's no way that was a freaking coyote. Or like a pack of coyotes. Maybe they hunt at night. Right? My cell's dead. You guys, I'm sorry. I had no idea. Come on, I heard about this thing online. And my cousin told me about it. Honestly, I thought it'd be fun. I didn't think anything would actually happen. What did you find upstairs? You guys, it's over. - We made it. God. That was so freaky. Shane, you're an asshole. Yeah, but a loveable one, right? - I don't know anymore. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Why the fuck did we do that anyway? I'm sorry. Did we not all survive? I mean, I apologize if anyone got too scared. But, you know, personally, that was kind of fun. Whatever, you guys. I'm going to bed. You can crash here if you want. I'm coming with you. And, Shane, you can sleep on the couch. - Will you stay with me, please? - Yeah, definitely. What did you guys find in here? Nothing. Just a shadow. My God, I'm so tired. - What? - I'm tired. You're tired? Why are you tired? Because I've been up all fucking night. Hey. - Hi, Rose. - Morning. - Hey, good morning. - Morning. About time. - Um, where's Jeff? - I thought he was with you. He had basketball practice this morning. He left. Didn't he come in the car with you? Yeah, but, I mean, it's only three miles. Knowing him, he probably jogged. I'll text him. Fuck. - What's wrong? - Shit. - Hold it up. - Do you have Band-Aids? Yeah, I do, actually. - Here. - Okay. - Here, let me see it. - I'm fine. I'm fine. Just give me the damn Band-Aids! Okay. I hope you like your tomatoes bloody. Well, the eggs are ready. Okay, where are your forks? - Bitch. - What did I do? "What did I do?" Little Miss Perfect. You've been copying me since I was 10 and I'm so over it. Okay, Jenna, maybe we should just take a nap. Fuck you! You like Shane, but you couldn't have him, so you went for his best friend. Have you ever even been to a basketball game? Of course I have. And stop trying to act like Kaitlan's fucking best friend! - Okay, Jenna, calm down. - Okay, Jenna, I love you. I don't know what you're talking about. - Jenna! Jenna! What the fuck is wrong with you? I... Rose. I didn't mean any of the things I said. Ever since I woke up this morning, I've just been... It's fine. Um... it's a beautiful day out if anybody wants to go hiking with me. I'd kind of really like to get out of the house. Um, I mean, you guys should go, but I kind of want to take a nap. Is that okay? Absolutely. Um... I think I'm gonna go change my shoes. Yeah, me, too. Are you sure you don't want to go out? Yeah. I'm just kind of tired. But you should go. Okay. You should kick her backpack. It's natural. Hey, why don't you take a hit? It'll slow you down so we can catch up. Cunt. Yeah, let's just catch up? Why is everybody in such a hurry? Hello? Kaitlan? Jenna? Shane? This isn't funny, Shane. Kaitlan? Shane? How far have we hiked? Only a couple miles. Who's that? It's my brother. I'll bet. What is that supposed to mean? You know what? You've always been texting, texting. I never ask who it is. But you've been getting a lot lately. Are you seeing somebody else? Show me! Yeah, I don't have to show you shit. Who are you fucking? That little whore Emily? She really likes football players. Rumor has it she's fucked them all. Emily Mason? Little Miss Cheerleader. Really good at doing splits. Well, I mean, I don't know her, but I've always heard she's nice. She is. To football players. That's really insane, Jenna. We should probably go. Yeah. Sorry. Let's go, crackadoodle. Looks like a clown. The cloud. Come on, we're going. Right. Is this the path we came in on? Shit! Whoa, cool. That'd definitely break your neck. That's not funny. Come on, I'll walk next to you. Okay. You okay? Okay. - Watch your step there. - Okay. Hang on. I got a text from Rose. It just says help. Call her. What the fuck is wrong with you? Nothing. Let's go. - Rose! - Rose, where are you? What happened? I saw him. - Who? - The... the thing. The Midnight Man. No way. Where'd you see him? He was... he was upstairs in the room that I was in. Rose, give me the knife. Rose, you're gonna hurt yourself. - You've got to give him the knife. - Rose. He... he looked at me. This is happening. It's real. It's all happening. Okay, come on now. Just give him the knife! Easy. Easy. Just give him the knife, Rose. Okay. Okay. Thank you. It's real... it's really... it's real... I'm gonna go check it out. It's okay, Rose. I'm scared too, okay? Let me guess... No. Of course. I'm really sorry that I freaked out at you guys. I don't know what's going on with me. It's the game. I shouldn't have talked you guys into playing it. I'm sorry. Listen, I... I think I'm just... I'm gonna go home. Can you get a ride from somebody else? Don't worry about me. I'll take her. Thank you for letting me stay. You have a very lovely home. Thank you. Do you guys mind helping me clean up a little bit? The living room's a mess. Yeah, I guess I'll help. Thank you. He's behind you. Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Jeff, are you okay? It's not my fault. Are you okay? I'm losing it. I'm turning into a schizo. - Rose? - Hey. - What's wrong with Jenna? - I thought you were going home? I decided to stay. Yeah, I thought I heard your car leave. No, I was going to, but I... guess I fell asleep or something. It's the game. That's why we're all so, I don't know, whatever you want to call it. Just look at Jenna. Maybe you're right. Maybe this happens sometimes. Like, okay, remember our candles went out and then we forgot all about them. We didn't do the circle of salt till the last minute. I mean, that's the problem. You said we have to do everything exactly as instructed, right? Shit. Jenna. Okay, so we play the game again. Really? If we do everything right... What about Jeff? Shouldn't Jeff be here? - Did you ever hear from him today? - No. I'm sure he's fine, then. He's fine. Yeah. I'm gonna go check on Jenna. Jenna? Jenna? Shit! - Jenna. It's okay. It's just me. Sweetheart, it's okay. Okay. Baby. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. So we'll just sit and wait. You relight the candle immediately if it goes out and I have the salt right here. That's right. Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Yeah, Shane, tell us. Well, I read about some... rumors online. About what? - Just weird shit, you know? - Like? Like, you know, I think about it like urban legend stuff. Like UFO stuff. You know, it's not real. Shane, what did you hear? Well, apparently this guy played the game with some friends of his down in Stamford. He's a blogger, he's blogging about it and he says that... he says that at first it's really cool. And then he said that things started to get really weird. And then he just stopped blogging. And they found his remains a few days later in the backyard. Someone put him through a wood chipper. You're kidding. This other site, it talked about how you can... how you can get trapped. - Trapped in what? - Trapped in, like, a cycle. You know, like you live out... or the last moment of your life, you live it out again and again and again. God, that would suck. You fucking asshole. Kait, I'm... Kait, come on, you know it's not even possible. - Shit. - Nine... - A match. - ...eight, seven, six... - I thought I had one here. - ...five, four... - Shit. - ...three... - Fuck! - Kaitlan! ...two, one. - We're fucked. - Where's the salt? - Kaitlan! - Shit. Scoop it into a circle. There's enough left. I think it's a little late for that. - Fuck. God. Who the fuck is calling me? Who is it? Stay away from me. What is wrong with her? I'm so glad you found me. You've got two ways of looking at this. Shane's a lousy boyfriend and a miserable fuck. So fuck his ass. The butcher knife Rose was playing with... cut his head off. Or you can get the hell out of here, do yourself in, and let that prick spend the rest of his life knowing that it was his fault. Something's got to give, right? What do we do now, Rose? - I don't know. - What's wrong with her? - God, what is that? Why don't you go look? It's Jeff. - He says he's here. - What? Where? God, what is that noise? God, I just wish it would stop. Go see what it is. - Jeff. Really? Really? Kaitie? Kaitie? Kaitie. Kaitlan! Rose! Rose? Rose, it's Jeff. Rose? - Where's Jenna? - I don't know. Jenna? Jenna! Kaitlan! Kaitie? Kaitie! Kaitie! Kaitie! Kaitie. Rose! Rose? Rose! Rose? He's behind you. Behind you. - Rose! He's behind you. It's not my fault. It's not my fault! It's not my fault! Wow. Fuck me. You were right. I guess. Whatever. Yay, Rose to the rescue. I had the weirdest dream. I don't know, it was something. Shit. Hey, everybody. Hey, guys, what's up? Where have you been? I had practice this morning. And then I had to hang out with my parents. Then I snuck out. But not before grabbing some shitty wine. Cool. You guys knock yourself out. I'm going to bed. Me, too. Wh... I'll tell you what. I'm gonna crack that open, and I'm gonna drink it, and I will tell you everything tomorrow. Wow. Very nice? Nice. As you can see, everything is in top condition. It changed hands several times in the past few decades. - What's it listed at? - Let me get that for you. Here you go. We've lowered it a bit. It's been on the market for almost two years. How come? Well, full disclosure here? Yeah. There was an incident with some high school kids. This is that house? Yes. What's that? Must be a breeze. Would you like to see upstairs? No. You know, why don't I just show you the other property? It is just down the road a few miles. That high school quarterback, some speculate that he did all the killing. - Yeah. Yeah. - And he just disappeared. Hey, guys. - Whoa. - What? Nice house. Yeah, my mom's got a good job. All right, snap out of it, sunshine.
