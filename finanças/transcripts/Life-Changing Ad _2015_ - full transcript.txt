"Gentle man, 46, "looking for young woman who likes the countryside" "Hello, Paul, I'm Annette. "I live in a small town in the North with my son. "I'm 38. I don't know if that's still young." The Ad I messed up because you left me. I'm thinking here, and I know that's why. I've stopped drinking, Annette. No more cock-ups. I had to, to understand, but now, without you, I'm lost. There's no meaning without you. Nothing. What couldn't you say on the phone? You didn't have to come. I'm here, don't say that. It's not fair. Is it fair I'm here for a licence? You could have killed people. 4 grammes, Didier. Do you realise what that is? I'll get out early. I'm getting an early release. I'll be out at Christmas. Annette... It's hard here. I think only of being out. I think only of seeing you. Maybe you've used me not being there to see others. I'm here like an idiot. I didn't even kill anyone. There's no one, Didier. I'm just asking for a last chance. It was good for me to see you. It gives me courage thinking of seeing you at Christmas. That's it. I love you, Annette. I put up the ad a long time ago. I'd actually forgotten it. It's good when you're not expecting something. I'd never answered an ad. It's lucky you saw it. I'd never have thought of looking myself. It's silly... Since I live somewhere isolated, I don't have a choice. Life on a farm isn't easy. I lived with a girl, but she left. She didn't like it, being isolated and everything. Well, I can understand. - Was it long ago? - Oh, yes! I took my time getting over it. Then, I didn't really feel like it. One day, I thought it would be good to not live my life alone. Has it been over long with your son's father? Yes. He has a new life. We don't see each other. It's less complicated if you want to leave. Yes, that's true. You can stay to eat if you want. No. Thanks, Mum, but I have to tidy up. I have lots of ironing to do. It was to make it easier for you. You look tired, dear. I went to see Didier the other day. - He seems to want to change. - He wouldn't say otherwise. - I've met someone. - I don't understand. I answered a personal ad and I've met someone. He's a farmer. We met between his and here, in Nevers. He lives in Nevers? No, in the Auvergne. I don't know where, in the country. That's good news. He really wants a wife, see? - He seems sensitive. - Has it been long? No. We've only seen each other once. We're meeting on Saturday. That's why I asked you to take Eric. But I won't go, there's no point. But why not go? It's over with Didier, Annette. There's no going back. Who is it? He doesn't live here. Good. Here, you'd always be stuck with Didier. Seriously, you would. He never leaves her alone, she forgives all. When he made that scene at the till, she forgave him. You're stupid. Don't worry, she remembers better than you. Annette! Why are you doing this? What? I've said nothing about you not having your daughter! I'm not ashamed. You'll be manipulated. I said I've met someone! Exactly, that's why I'm pissing you off. - Annette. - What? Don't answer him. It's in summer. It's nicest then. Imagine it in winter when it's all white. - Is that your sister? - Yes, that's Nicole. - Is she older than you? - No, she's a year younger. Have you always lived together, then? I'm an only child. That has advantages too. It makes you secretive. You don't know how to talk. I don't speak much either. We don't talk much, me, Nicole and my uncle. That's what's good being in a couple, being able to talk. This summer, everything will be ready. We'll have finished the work and be organic. With some luck, we'll make good cheese. If it goes well, maybe you could come with your son. It's a while away. It goes quickly. I felt the 3 weeks without seeing you was months. - It felt a long time. Not for you? - Yes. When we know we'll see each other, it's not as long. And it's not easy in winter. This summer, I'll have less work with the animals at pasture. Winter doesn't scare me. What does is the time not seeing each other. Do you want to come now? It's silly, but... I'd imagined spending Christmas together. Actually, I've thought about that too, being with you and your kid, but it's better in summer for you. Winter is too harsh. No, it would be pretty with the snow. He won't be long. It's better if we're together to tell him. Why not let him finish the school year here? Wait a bit before you get him to go. How will he take it? New school, new house... That's hard on him. Is Dad out? No, he's not. Why do you say that? Your faces. Yes, I do have something to tell you. Sit down, little wolf. - Your mother has decided... - Mum, let me talk. Sorry, it was just to start. Well. I've met someone, a man, and we're going to move in together. With you, of course. Well, who is he? He has cows. He's a farmer. He's called Paul. He's very nice and really wants to meet you. Is he coming here to eat? No. He lives far away. - Where does he live? - In the Auvergne. Where's that? In the middle of France. It's lovely there. She showed me the photos. We'll live there? Yes. We'll leave during the Christmas holidays. It's best to change schools now. Later, it would be strange for you. - Are you coming too, Gran? - No. But I'll come and see you. You can come here on holiday. That would be nice. What'll you do there? We'll get settled, then I'll look for a job. The school looks good. You'll have to take a bus. You know, like the yellow bus in American films. I don't want to leave. - It's to be expected. - Yes. It's a lot to take in at once. Are there no streetlights? There are so few people, it would waste electricity. Aren't there many people here? No. You could say it's uninhabited. But we're not all alone. Were you born here? No. I lived in town when I was small. - Why did you come here? - To help my uncle. Welcome to Las Vegas. There. He's OK there? I got the bed second-hand. Yes, it's fine. This is my bar. A tree fell in the storm. I made a big shelf with it. And I built those cupboards. The sink was there, I got the gas cooker second-hand. I got you some boots. Khaki, it's standard, with the mud, better than something fancy. You can change them if you want. No, they're fine. 38's my size. - Here. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. It's late. I never sleep in like that. Do you want coffee? - I brought your cases up. - Thanks. In a bowl? I got some bowls from the neighbours. They had too many. I have to get back to work. I'll let you settle in, I'll be back later. It's not the best season to get here. You know there's a lot of work with setting things up? Yes, he told me. He told you we have problems too? The conversion is not for fun. So, you're from the North? Yes, from Bailleul. I knew a guy, Verlic. He had a nice herd, Belgian Blues. They can't hold out on the plateau. They're prairie animals. Are you eating here? No. I got some stuff. We'll eat upstairs. We can eat here. I didn't say that for me. I don't care. - Has the boy seen the stable? - No, they just got here. Come on. That's Iphigenia. That's Penelope, her sister. Olympia's daughters. Olympia has character. We always keep her male calves. You have to choose them well. When one is good, her children usually are too. They're like mammoths. You're not wrong. Salers are one of the oldest breeds. Is that why they have Greek names? No, that's Nicole. She likes mythology. These ones are young. Come here. - Cute, aren't they? - Yes. They're huge. They're pregnant. They'll calf in a few days. Annette, it's me. It's Didier. I don't understand. Where are you? I'm going crazy, call me. - Hello, Mum? - I expected some news. How are you? Oh! It's good to hear you. I'm fine. I was worried. It's because there's no signal inside. - Is it going OK with Paul? - Yes. Is Eric with you? Eric stayed inside, he's unpacking stuff. - Have you met his family? - Yes, we've met. His sister has character, but she seems nice. - So, are you OK? - Yes, fine. - Oh, God! - Go straight ahead. We'll go to Besse so you know the way. That'll be my mother. Does Nicole work far away? No. She visits old people. She reads to them and does housework. I think I overcooked it. Veal is best when it's tender. It's best cooked at a low heat on a hot pan. - Is it one from here? - Yes. Will the ones we saw get eaten? We keep the females for milk, and the males are eaten. The best become bulls. We kept Olympia's sons to be bulls. But Olympia is the star. She even competed in fairs. You should have seen her. Beautiful, well-groomed. Nicole washed her every other day, because dried mud tears out hair. It's easy with Olympia. When they go out in spring, the others let her go first. It's funny. It's me. What are you up to? I'm out. So call me. Call me! - Are you OK, Mum? - You sound funny. I'm putting Eric on. Eric, it's Gran. OK. - Hello, Gran? - Yes, little wolf. Thanks for the present. - You like it? - Yes. - Is it your size? - Yes. - Put your mum on, please. - OK. I'll get Mum. - Bye, my dear. - Bye. Speak soon. - Here, Mum. - Merry Christmas. Yes, Mum? Are you eating with the Falats? Yes. Ask them to see you to your door. - Is there news from Didier? - Yes, he's out. I hope he won't go to see you. - He wouldn't dare. How are you? - I'll be fine. Well. Love you, Mum. Love you. - Enjoy the day. - Happy Christmas. Yes, me too. Goodbye. - Is my dad out? - I don't know. - Did you tell him we're here? - Listen, Eric... It was very good. The vegetables marinated all day. I get inspiration from cooking programmes. You watch Popote Chef? Don't disturb her when she's watching, especially when taking notes. What was your job? I was a shelf-stacker in a supermarket. There aren't many supermarkets here. Yes, there are enough as it is. In my day, we didn't have so much choice and we were fine. Everything was better. You're not wrong. In my day, we were useful. The day we were made to be productive, everything went to pot. Those idiots wrecked the fields. Everyone at the chamber of agriculture sold out so we'd use fertiliser. It was all organic. So now, they need norms, controls, and labels to prove it. - Do you want a jumper? - The heating's on. - No, I'm not cold. It's different for us, we move about all day. There's work with the move. No, it's nothing. When I see everything you do here, it's... You run about everywhere on a farm. We think we're together, but we don't see each other much. You wouldn't know, unless you're here. So you wanted to live in the country? Yes. Thank you. Is your mother celebrating Christmas alone? No. She's with friends. Paul told me you're an only child. Yes. - It's hot. - No, I'll do it. Sit down. Hold the dog! Don't let her cut herself. Come here. Tinou, stay. The dog's nice. Thieves have it easy, he wouldn't hurt a fly. - How old is he? - He's been with us 7 years. - Good night. - Thanks again. Eric, are you coming? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - It was good, wasn't it? - Very good. - Are you not going to smoke? - No, I'm too cold. Take my jacket. It's warm. - No, I don't want to smoke. - Take it. It's duck down. You won't be cold with that. Merry Christmas. Thank you. - Here. - Thanks. With this, I'll learn things. - It's for me? - I chose it with Eric. Well, thank you. We shouldn't force it. We've time. It's a big upheaval. Can I put the light out? I was looking for Paul's overalls to wash them. It's done. - Do you soak them first? - Yes. - For long? - It depends. Let me know for next time. Can I do something to help? There's the wood, we've not had time to put it in the barn. I'll do it. - You like the dog. - Yes. It's great. He follows me. Tinou! He knows you like him. I was wondering where you were. Nicole suggested I put the wood away. You're not used to it. With the pallets at the shop, logs don't scare me. Your mother's solid. She doesn't look it, but she's strong. I could have done the wood. She wanted to do something. - Do you worry when I do it? - Well! What? We're rich enough to not wait for the sales? The jacket is a good brand. Have you made progress? It was meant to be done by Christmas. I changed the bedding, like every morning. Should I thank you? I don't know how I've put up with you all these years. Young woman seeks housework... "Housework"? It's the wrong season. That's in summer with the holiday houses. It's a bit dead here, in winter. Have you been here long? No. I've just moved onto a farm. - I'd like to get work. - There's not much. Where are you from? The North. I worked in a supermarket. - Cashier? - Yes. If I hear of something... Well, thanks. Bye. Don't touch it. Shit... - Hello? - Eric, it's Dad. Yes, Dad. - How are you? - Fine. Annette? Why are you calling me? I told you I'd be at my mother's. I told you. I told you not to call. What else do you want me to say? What else do you want? No, that's not true. If you want to get better, tell yourself you can see your son when you're well. I don't want you to call me to say things like that. It's over, Didier. This time I'm not coming back. I'm not there. I'm far away. I've gone. Get it? I've gone. Can you hear me? Somewhere I'll never see you again, because I don't want to see you! Get it? It's none of your business. You're thinking of your son now, but you weren't there for him. You were never there! I put up with everything! I want you to leave me alone! Leave me alone! Come on! You shouldn't have tossed your phone. Your girlfriend seems to like the country. I saw her on the phone in the middle of nowhere. We've no signal, that's why. I was at Mr Robert's. You know his daughter got divorced? - She always liked you. - Why are you saying that? I don't know. He asked after you. If we can't even talk to you. I should be sighing. Couldn't you wait to bring someone here? I persuaded Antoine to help us with the changes. - Why did you bring them now? - They're here now. Yes, they're here. And they have no money. We'll have to wait for spring for more money. My work pays for a lot here. - I'm allowed to find it strange. - What? That you're acting like an idiot at your age. Maybe I'm being stupid. It could be normal, a pretty girl leaving everything to live in our dump. Hello? How are you, Richard? Really? No problem, I'll come over. Pass the keys. I'm going to Richard's. - Why? - Annette broke down. - Are you alone? - François is milking. So... She's pretty. Is that strange? No, not at all. You're lucky. The kid too, he's funny. He wanted to see the calves. It was nice of you to tow them. I saw your car by the road and stopped. I saw them sitting, numb with cold. She was scared, I think. - The car? - It's the drive belt. I'll get the part tomorrow. How's your dairy going? I'm hurrying to finish. Nicole is worried, you know her. Take time to let them settle. It's not easy coming here. Especially not knowing each other. It's strange being together. It's weird. You shouldn't be scared. Winter is good for heating up at night, isn't it? - How are you? - It's not warm. - Want a drink? - We won't stay, there's the milking. Shame. You're here for once. I'm overrun with the dairy. There's a lot of changes just now. Well. Are you OK? - I'm sorry. - Doesn't matter. His car's shit, it's not your fault. Stay for a drink. Next time. We'll go now. - Bye, guys. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. You're lucky Richard saw you. Our mechanic. It used to be his job. He and François are organic. They have Montbeliardes. They make more milk than yours. They're not interesting cows. François is good at management. He knows about grants. He saw that by going organic, he'd sell his milk better. You should have called. I'd have come. Yes, but I had no battery. Did you call your mother today? - No. Why? - Nothing. The meat's well cooked. That's nice, but it's not true. I'm having problems with the oven. It doesn't heat well. When I turn it down, it stays hot. I couldn't buy a new one. - May I leave? - Yes. I can't cook well. It's not the cooker. I can't drive well either. I'm sorry. We shouldn't have come now. - I know we're in the way. - You're not. I told you, it's not easy in winter here, and I can't be around much. But I'm happy. I can pay for the car. You don't have to pay. It's a favour. We get by here, you know. We have old machines, we can fix them. Don't worry about it. Nicole's not mad at me? Nicole has something to say about everything. She's been like that since she was a kid. It will be better if I get work. Don't worry. We get by here. And we need time. That's all. Yes. But winter doesn't bother me. It's pretty here, with the snow. It's strange, there aren't any curtains. Hello. How are you? I'm cold. Come on, quickly. Give me your bag. Where's my pen? This one? Yeah. Thanks, Vivien. So... Complete. OK. Occasional work. The date? Agricultural worker. Well, yes, but where are you? Huh? I'll get it. It's my mother. We'll stay here. You sign. And I need your payslips. Where are they? You have a letter from a judge about custody of Eric. - Shall I read it? - Go on. "Please attend the civil court "in relation to custody..." What does that mean? I showed Mr Lebedel the letter. He said that since you ran away... - He got a lawyer? - Yes. He couldn't have done that. What does he want? Custody of Eric? Yes. - Does he have the right? - Yes. He's just out of prison. They know that. You shouldn't leave without telling the father. Could he get shared custody? Yes, well, alternating. What did Mr Lebedel say? He could get your son during the holidays. He can't, not even for half the holidays. Yes, dear, but what can I tell you? What will I tell Paul? Mum... Mum, do you realise? The poor guy. Since his parents died, he's really let himself go. I've wanted to come see him for a while. You gave me the courage. Well, what? What did I say? Not many people are lucky enough to meet a girl like you. You have your sister and uncle. What's up? My mother's not well. She has to do tests. I might have to go and see her with Eric. - I don't understand. - She has tests to do. - What tests? - She doesn't know. A check-up. She's feeling weak. I don't think it's anything serious. He always says I'm little, that annoys me. That's nothing. You're new. They're testing you. Don't listen. We might go to Bailleul for 2 days. - In the holidays? - No, in 10 days. Why? Your father wants to see you. He's called a judge. I didn't know he'd ask. I think it's a good thing. Will we go back to live? No, for 2 days to see the judge. Eric! Eric! Why aren't you eating? I'll call the vet. He can't note the treatment. No, Paul. We're not going to cheat. We'll have one less for milk. It'll be fine in 2 years. She's right. When you're little, you can't cheat. Then you're always the first to be duped. Do you think she'll live? She wants to, but sometimes, that's not enough. That's not what we needed. - What's up? - Nothing. Everything's fine. Really? Well, great. Why were you fighting? Eric, answer me! Answer me, Eric. Is it because they say you're little? They say you're a whore and farmers are conned by women like you. But you know that's not true. Why didn't you say about my father? It was difficult to talk about it, Eric. Get out. Stop the act! When Paul finds out, he won't want us anymore. You're a liar! I hate you! Paul has things he didn't tell me too. Adults have secrets. Your Annette, her son, it's not right. I'm saying what I think, Paul. Who are the people you brought here? The kid got into a fight at school. Don't you see the damage it will do when we start selling? - He was in a fight? - With the Fontanel boy. We could sell them produce for their restaurant. When we have something to sell... At your pace, we might go under first. You're here? Did you really get into a fight? - Yes. - Did the Fontanel boy bother you? - Yes. - That family are idiots. - How did you get hurt? - I don't know. I'm sorry about Eric. That kid's disturbed. Why are you taking him with you? If his gran's not well, you should protect him. It's perhaps not the best time for him to miss school. We're not going to see my mother. She's fine. Eric's father wants to see him. I left without telling him. We're just going there to see what he wants. That's all. Nothing to say? Leave me alone. - Iphigenia is doing better. - Yes. She's had antibiotics. She's started eating a bit. I'm sorry for fighting. I told you, the Fontanels are idiots. It's brave to defend yourself. - What? - Does the dairy meet the norms? Yes. - Well done. - I'm having lunch downstairs. I can't always leave Nicole alone with our uncle. Yes, of course, I understand. - Aren't you finishing it? - You gave me a lot. We could make smaller cheeses. Just cantal, not salers. People might like getting a whole cheese. - Yes, that's an idea. - At least I'm trying to have some. They might not all be good. Isn't Annette eating? Anyway, you've done well. Your dairy's a good one. I'm going to see Iphigenia. He's still anxious. Good night. Don't read too late. I didn't think he'd want his son. He's not motivated. It's my fault. I should have told you. I'm an idiot to think people are honest. I shouldn't have come to Nevers the second time. What do you want, Annette? I didn't mean what I said last night. I can explain. I've never really liked explanations. It's hard, not talking. You should have talked before. Can you take us to the coach tomorrow? It goes through Condat to Clermont. I can take you to the bloody station! Well, goodbye. François will come to explain about the cheeses. He makes yoghurt. His father made cantal. He knows how. 40 years ago. I took a course. Can you trust me instead of constantly watching? I'm fed up of how you're at my back, seeing the worst, like anything new will be a catastrophe. Oh, OK, I see. If I hadn't thought, we wouldn't have done the dairy. If I didn't plan for the future, we'd go under, because you just do whatever. The dairy costing 3 times less than getting someone in is just whatever? I told you that them coming wouldn't stop me doing it. - Has she gone for good? - None of your business! It's my life! You make decisions for the animals, not for me! You decide nothing for me, you're not involved! It's funny. It's like when your nurse left and you stopped moving. I thought you were dead. The soup I spoon-fed you... I even gave up on Vivien. Have you seen what it's like being alone? You bring a girl, she doesn't last 2 months, she goes back, and it's my fault? It's no one's fault. I won't let myself go. Sorry for being scared for you when the other one left. Once you're used to it, it'll be fine. Nicole shouldn't worry. It's usual to mess up the first ones. She'll always find a way to worry. It's how we keep going. By imagining the worst, she saves us from it. I've never been able to see the obvious. You don't look good. - It's Annette. She's gone. - Where? Anyway, it's not easy between us. The kid's dad wants to see his son. She didn't tell him she was coming here. She lied to me. She might've had a good reason not to mention it. - She doesn't give a toss about me. - Why? - What does he want? - Not my business. It is your business. Did you ask her, at least? She's been stupid. You don't run off without telling the father. She seems sensible. She wouldn't have come to go right back again. - She didn't come for me. - Try to find out. I wouldn't let a girl like that go. What do you know about girls? You're really getting stupid now. At our age, we've had lots of relationships. But you were single for a long time. You might be a bit rigid. Life in a couple is complicated. It's life. - Hi. - Hi. I think he's drinking again. And not just a bit. It will be fine. So, Ms Annette Rousseau, tell us why you moved and why you did not inform your son's father. He was in prison then. I told him we weren't together, but... he tried emotional blackmail to spend Christmas together. I knew what he wanted. To come back. And when I met someone and he suggested I move in, I didn't think twice, because he's decent. When Didier drank too much, he beat me. And he drank like no one else. I never filed a complaint, but a colleague can back me up. Her colleague can back her up. She lost custody of her daughter because she drank. - My wife's friends. - I'm not his wife. I'm Eric's father. I'm not leaving him with a crazy woman. And then? I got early release. We should have been together for Christmas. When I got out, she'd gone without telling me. She'll do anything. Go on. I never filed a complaint because he'd say sorry. He made promises, but it always happened again. He lost me my job because he insulted me in front of clients. I spent a lot of time looking for him in bars, so my mother would look after my son. At those times, I didn't see my son. If I'd told him, he would have stopped me. I was in prison! And you used that to leave! You were scared to tell me to my face. Please. Eric doesn't want to see him. He can come and tell you. He's scared. You see? I don't want to separate them. I just want Didier to be able to take responsibility for his son. My little boy is fragile just now, and it wouldn't be good for him to be with his father. I thought you were meant to protect those who were unhappy and help them. That's what I did for 12 years with him. But in the end I didn't manage to help him. Mr Brumant, what is your current situation? My client is currently looking for a job. He is living with his mother. I don't care about her kid, she can keep him. Are you OK? These papers are old. You could grow clover and flax. You think? We'll do it together. It will be land to feed our animals. If we do up your henhouse, you can have more birds and sell them at market. At market, yes. I think that's good. I'll come back later in the week. We'll see to that a bit. The guy was bigger than me. I couldn't hurt him much. Then, he tore my jacket. But now the others are nice. You have to earn respect. One boy is nice. We get the bus together. You didn't tell me. I didn't think to. Go to bed, it's late. We're going back tomorrow. Maybe not. We might stay with Gran. Well. Go on! To bed, my little wolf. Good night, Gran. Good night, treasure. Good night, Mum. You must be relieved. I don't know. I'm thinking it was useless loving Didier all those years. You can't change people. You can't say I didn't tell you. Yes, Mum. You also said not to leave straight away. I didn't listen. I keep messing up. You know, Eric told me he likes Paul. Paul's a good man, but he's hard, too. Perhaps his sister doesn't want us back. Stop being a child. What might his sister say? I don't know. Why isn't he calling me back? He might be scared. He might need to think a bit. You come into his life with Eric, you say the father's gone, and he comes back. That's a worry. Is he sensible? That's what you told me, when you first saw him. Oh! I'm going to bed. Today exhausted me. You deal with the farm's business well. I don't want us to end up with nothing. I like it here. Our money isn't in a mattress. I'm not alone here. There's no chance I'll find a girl who wants to fleece me. I went to see Vivien. Poor guy. He needs a woman like you. You know, I don't miss Vivien. He always looked sad. I'm going away until tomorrow. You don't mind? No. You'll do the milking? - Where's Antoine? - With Iphigenia. He's pampering her. Paul? Take my car, it's better. Thanks, Nicole. Stop worrying about everything. Would he come all this way to tell you not to go back? I don't know with him. It was easier than taking the train. He really likes you. You're not used to that. Mum, please! You can come and see us this summer, if things go well. You know, I never know what to do in the country. The air will do you good. Eric is always talking about you coming.
