And Amazon itself was out in a suburb that really was very far and any kind of scene There were basically two programmers working hard at writing code and Jeff working hard on the sort of business-y side of the new company. There wasn't this kind like, oh my god, what's What are we gonna tick off today? Oh my god, if that isn't done It was more just a case of methodically working as quickly as we could. Books arrived. Somebody was gonna have to and sometimes that would be Jeff. This is like the super early days when it was really just still the three of us plus his wife working part time. Sometimes it would be his wife MacKenzie. Sometimes it would even Shell or I if there weren't that many and we weren't super tied up in something. This was at a time when handling maybe less than 20 25 years sends 20 parcels but 14 million a day. The company owns over 250 warehouses and delivers on five continents.

There's a kind of to walk between slowly or rapidly taking over everything and yet not being so visible that people become alarmed.

Its acquisition of Whole Foods, leader of high-end organic Jeff Bezos is a complex character. He's a CEO as well as an investor. But in 2013, he personally one of the most prestigious Step by step, the Amazon empire extends its grip on the world. Really, Amazon at this point represents the transformation of The old saying when I first came to the Street back in the day was what's good for GM Today that's largely Amazon as the largest market cap company. It's greatly intertwined with the entire American and global economy. Amazon essentially It's not really a market, Amazon sets the rules. It gets to decide which which companies rank who can even be there, what they're allowed to sell, how they can communicate what they have to pay in The old saying is if and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Amazon looks like a monopoly, makes money like a monopoly, so when I look at it you have to use monopolies in the traditional sense to find a comparable type company. The real definition of a monopoly is when you have the by which other players So, when you have that kind of power to dictate what happens, and Amazon has that power, Amazon has become a kind of gatekeeper and their strategy is very much about being the e-commerce platform Amazon is conquering one territory after another. After the U.S., Jeff Bezos Germany, France, Japan, Canada, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, and Australia. Today the decisive battle for the company is taking place in India. In 2013, Amazon arrived in of gaining control of a market conquer or falter. What Amazon has been is they've been able to, pretty much all major whether it is in Europe or in the U.S. and some of the other Asian markets as well outside of China. The only battlefield that So, A, this is the only B, it is a significantly India is the in the world with a seven In recent years, have joined the middle class, dramatically increasing the number of internet users and eager consumers. As a result, Indian e-commerce is growing by 30 to 50% every year. Amazon is not the only company trying to tap into this growth. Competing with Jeff Bezos is Flipkart, the leader of the Indian market founded by two ex-Amazon employees and Paytm, a new startup financed The three of them are waging a multibillion dollar commercial war. In its first year, Jeff Bezos invested two billion dollars and then two billion To gain market share, Amazon has already invested in India without seeing a profit. All these three players They have a lot of big guys backing up. So, you don't see anyone The battle as these multinational a very strong nationalist This is the case in old Delhi, the commercial district Here, commercial structures have remained unchanged for hundreds of years. Sitting at the largest group of Each owns several shops they are the first to feel the The merchants but they have a major asset They form the electoral base of the BJP, the party in power in India since 2014.

And if it fails, it will reflect bad in It's not a regional story, To counter the Americans, the merchants of Old Delhi have a plan to ensure the government The troubled businesses will be hurt because their plans for five years or 10 years down the line. Because they have deep pockets, they can afford to sustain big losses, that is why they are coming to India. You can see any example in the world, wherever they went in the first instance, they created their own market and again then created their monopoly and. This bus to alert other merchants of the threat that looms over India. In 2018, Amazon to invest yet again another two billion dollars in the country. Its operations in India have so far resulted in a net loss of $883 million. Investing massive amounts in order to conquer market share is the foundation of Jeff Despite this risky plan, Amazon's boss still maintains the confidence of the financial markets. Amazon's stock value rises constantly. In the last four years, it has increased fivefold. Amazon lost about three billion dollars in its first six years in And it worked. Now Amazon is the dominant book retailer with more than half the market and they've consistently done that in one sector after another where they go in, they lose money. Other companies that are not, don't have the same aren't able to operate at a loss. They go out of business, This is a company that like that in a way that no one else is. Jeff Bezos, CEO, one analyzing a company is He spent time on Wall Street So, I believe he sort of intuitively knew what institutional knew how to educate 'em about time frames. As an analyst it's not but you want to know when that cash is expected to come in the door. That helps you build And so, I believe he did to speak the language to Jeff Bezos has been communicates what he's And he always talks about this idea that Amazon is for the long term, that he's not focused on the short term, that what he's building and it's over the long term. And Wall Street investors have very much bought into that idea and they have backed this company even in the years when years when they made very little money. Wall Street continued Jeff Bezos was successful in imposing his long term vision to an economy geared Having secured the he was able to make all of the world's commodities This ideal of accessibility was borne 50 years ago in San Francisco, capital of the American counter culture.

In the 1960s in California, thousands of young Americans turned away from industrial society, the Vietnam war, and the atomic bomb. They decided to return to the land and live in communities This was the birth of They were anti-big technology. They didn't like bombs, they but they loved LSD, they loved VW vans. They loved the products, the kind of consumer products And what they wanted to do was take those consumer turn them into the foundations of a new kind of society, a society built on shared experiences, personal ambition, consumption. Consumption for the the foundation of a The Whole Earth Catalog was part of the movement. This publication was a former biology student He wanted to help they needed to fend for themselves by showing them where to It's so weird because, so these people are going to build farms but what kind of tools do they take? They take books. And that's because what was not just farm equipment They wanted to change their minds. Catalog is absolutely essential and to the commune But it's also central to Silicon Valley. They found this world and they began to reimagine computers that the Whole Earth Catalog had promised. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called the Whole Earth Catalog which was one of the It was idealistic, overflowing with neat On the back cover of their final issue were the words "Stay It was their farewell Stay hungry, stay foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. When you look at the catalog, it is trying to give you access to goods that will transform your life and it is trying to be whole. It is trying to literally You can see that now in the Amazon is in many ways of access to the things in its structure, in its interconnections, in its being a global information system to supply goods that It's the catalog online. Thanks to the internet, has Amazon globalized the ideals Today Stewart Brand, its founder, has a very rich friend, Jeff Bezos. But affinities between hippies Jeff Bezos is a libertarian He values complete unimpeded by laws and regulations. Amazon burned off the social vision that animated so many in the 1960s, the hope of a better through interconnected At least it's gone for And it's gone along with It's good along with some of The civic world is not something that I see Amazon caring about at all and I think that's a great shame. I think it's picked up on one of the core elements of but it's lost whatever civic and that's a great shame. My name is Alexander Schreiber. I grew up in Leipzig and I live here now. I am 41 years old. I have worked at Amazon Leipzig for So over the years, I have seen a lot. And now I can work at all of the large departments. Receive, Stow, Pick and Packing. Before joining Amazon, Alexander was a soldier But in the warehouse, he was confronted with where employees are treated like robots. Because how it usually works is that they create a position. Afterwards, the human like a piece of a puzzle. Not the other way around. At work, it is not about a single procedure of storing an item or picking up the Rather, the challenge lies That you might do something maybe 10,000 times a week, And meanwhile, staying physically, and your mind, psychologically. Keeping the precision after 500,000 You have a scanner that there's a line telling you where you have to go. When you pack you have to move the way where a computer stands and the scanners and the managers and teachers and leaders teach you to make so-called, of movement. So, first you take this hand, and you pack and do the line and you really have to There's something new in the sense that you work as a machine but you're also controlled by machines and this is something scary. If you don't follow this rhythm that corporation push on you They tell you if you don't we don't want unhappy workers. And also, when I have to do I don’t get bored to an extent that causes « bore out syndrome». It has the same effects as a burnout, but it is characterized by That’s the challenge. And that’s the psychological The main one, in my opinion. In Germany, on Black Friday, the unions are calling for a strike. I am welcoming you to this who organized today’s event. Thanks to those of you who helped In Europe, Jeff where social protections and where employees For the last five years, Verdi, the main German union, has been organizing strikes in the country's 11 Amazon warehouses. Did you sign up for the strike Done. The workers are mainly asking for wage increases. Thanks to these mobilizations, the Leipzig warehouse increased their wages by See you tomorrow then, thank you! April 2018. The major German media group Axel Springer is about to award Bezos its prize for the most innovative Verdi has called on workers to come and protest in Standing alongside the Germans today are Polish, Italian, and French workers. They are 1,000 strong. Welcome to Berlin. Thanks, it's great to be here. Today Amazon is You're probably the biggest At the same time, you are by unions and by media for inappropriate working conditions. How do deal with these accusations? If you're going to do you have to be willing If you can't afford to be misunderstood then for goodness' sake, don't do anything new or innovative. We no longer tighten our I'm very proud of our working conditions and I'm very proud of Even if Jeff Bezos doesn’t In Germany we employ 16,000 people. We pay at the high end of the We demand wages and to work less so we can live more. We have very good so we don't believe that an intermediary between Congratulate you for Thank you.

But Amazon is also the It has nothing to do with but it's of strategic importance. The cloud, an online data Entire databases and web services are physically hosted in huge buildings filled with servers. Amazon owns 120 data centers like this one spread around the world. In 2017, Amazon Web Services accounted for only 12% of its turnover, but 60% of its profits. Amazon is a retailer but it's really, it's a mistake to think Amazon is a company that the underlying infrastructure So, it wants to be the platform on which all buying and selling happens. It wants to be basically the interface between all buyers and sellers. It is a major part of the cloud, Amazon Web Services controls about a third of the world's cloud computing capacity. And increasingly it's moving into shipping and package delivery. There isn't anything in history It's completely a new thing. We've never really encountered But you can think about it in the sense that that's and lots of other companies in order to get to market. That's an incredibly powerful position. I don't think Amazon that could potentially challenge it. I think the only thing today would be government intervention. Aware of the risk, Amazon is increasingly nurturing its relationships with governments. In 17 years, its lobbying In the United States, they've gone from to $13 million in 2017. In Europe alone, they add up Will Jeff Bezos use this money to counter a less than In 2017, for the first time, the European Commission Margaret Vestager, European sanctioned Amazon for The Commission has that Amazon's tax benefits are illegal under EU state aid rules. A tax ruling granted by Luxembourg has reduced Amazon's tax between May 2006 and June 2014. It was not justified. Amazon now has to repay the tax benefit worth around $250 million Amazon paid the $250 million but Luxembourg appealed the decision. Not all states endorsed the Nor do they all support other measures that promote tax fairness. The thing with Amazon, and we know that from the tax case, is that you don't necessarily make profits but you create value. So, you create value but you don't make So, people make money by instead of making money by having a profit coming out of the business itself. And one of the reasons why we're so eager also to have a sort of broad is to make sure that we get it right because digital companies on where ordinary businesses Europe is trying that specifically This new tax would levy their revenues and not their profits since these web giants usually store away their profits in countries France is alone in We have all had a wake yes, technology is fascinating and it produces great but there's a bad side to everything. There's a threat to our democracy, there's a threat to there's a threat for us as consumers to be respected in the marketplace. We need to get in control of that. So, here it is. The world according to Amazon. A world where a single company controls the distribution of the infrastructure of our economy. When I'm buying stuff on Amazon or receiving packages or have I'm like, yes, awesome. Man, that's a great thing that we built. But as I said, if I put on my then I'm a lot more questioning of whether I really I think most of the time I feel That I helped to create turn out to really be a The issue is who shapes Is it us or is it Amazon? That's the question. On the that question has already been answered. Here Amazon is already imposing its vision of the world of tomorrow. At first glance, it's an ideal world. The company's headquarters are located in this building called Day 1. At its feet, the brand new A series of glass balls sheltering rare tropical plants like a biotube 2.0, where Amazon employees come to work in harmony with a domesticated nature. In total, 20% of Seattle's downtown area is occupied by Amazon. In the last eight years, 40,000 new executives have joined the ranks Often young and very well paid, they can take full advantage and can preview much of Lockers where you can pick Or Amazon Go supermarkets Customers enter with their smartphone and a computer automatically To welcome these newcomers, are constantly being constructed.

Here 30% of the homeless At City Hall, Seattle's Theresa Mosqueda made housing We saw about a 600% and we saw twice the amount of people who are living in RVS become homeless. That number is immense. You can see the crisis of poverty and homelessness on the street. However, here in Seattle we have a higher rate of homelessness per capita than cities like Los Angeles and it's imperative that we do something. We have a thousand people who are moving to this region a week which means if we're not building housing, the cost of housing increases. People who were in otherwise affordable rental units really have nowhere to go. They are falling into the street or they are getting displaced Spring 2018, the creation of a new tax. The biggest companies in will have to pay $500 in order to finance the We had initially proposed a tax that would have brought in $75 million a year which is a drop in the bucket We ended up with $47 million per year which Amazon agreed to. The proposal was passed unanimously, unanimously by the council Within 24 hours of Amazon agreeing to that amount of taxing each for five years for just after they agreed to that, within 24 hours they changed their mind, they funded the opposition and ran a campaign to undermine it.

Quickly the City Council voted to reverse its new taxation policy. Juarez vote for aye. Only two Council members, including Theresa Mosqueda, voted against the repeal of the tax. Mosqueda vote for nay. O'Brien vote for aye. Seven in favor, two opposed. So, the bill passes Three months the launching of his own housing policy. A two billion dollar private fund to help poorly housed families across the country. I want to make sure that by those who were elected not by the whims of one who on one day decides to donate money. I think it's a real warning signal to the entire country that we have got to be able to govern and to make sure that our most vulnerable are being protected and invested in. We need public policy to be passed by those who've been elected to do so. Every night in Seattle, City Hall opens its doors on the floor to those who
