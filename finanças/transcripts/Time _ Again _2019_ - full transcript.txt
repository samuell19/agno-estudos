[somber music] [Segundo] There's nothing more important in people's lives than time. Time flies so fast. From the moment you wake up, to the time you go to sleep. When you were a child, time seemed to move slowly. You wanted to grow up so badly so you could do the things adults do. But for some old people, they yearn to do the things young people do. If only we could turn back time, how many mistakes could we undo? How different would our life be if we could go back in time? Is it true that every decision one makes, whether big or small, affects the course of time? [Ipang] Hurry up, Apol. Your breakfast is getting cold. [Apol] Coming! [Ipang] What are you wearing again, Apolonia? That's what you call style. From which thrift store did you buy that? We have no idea if that was previously owned by a dead person. [glass clinking] By the way, I called your Aunt Virgie. I told her I can't handle your cousin anymore. What if Rio gets pregnant? I'll get blamed for it. Why would they blame you? Rio has a mind of her own. [Ipang] Don't take your cousin's side! She's always with that druggie boyfriend of hers! How did you know Troy's a druggie? His eyes are always bloodshot. Troy is a call center agent. His eyes are always like that because he doesn't get enough sleep. Am I being bashed again by the entire Republic of the Philippines this morning? Not the entire country. Just Aunt Ips. I've had it with you girls! Suit yourselves! Have a nice day, Aunt! [Ipang] Have a nice day? Piss off! -[Rio laughs] -You're so naughty. [birds chirping] What's with the umbrella? Is it raining? The sun is high. I don't want to get melanoma. What? Melanoma. Skin cancer. Caused by UV rays because our ozone layer is damaged. So what do you think of yourself? Porcelain skin? You can always take gluta drip. Excuse me, I don't aspire to have porcelain skin. So take that umbrella away. That's for old people with memory lapse. How are you and Troy? Damn him! What did you say? [tranquil music] Good morning, mister. [Segundo] Good morning, Apol. That's a beautiful dress. I know right. I'll go ahead. [Freddie] Apol, Apol! Do you have any plans later? -Going home. -Come with us. Where? It's my birthday. -Really? -Yeah. Happy birthday. How fun. I'm going to treat you guys. Then let's have drinks. Is it an official holiday tomorrow? Why are guys planning to get drunk? We're just having drinks, not get drunk. And it's my birthday anyway. Come with us. Angel and her boyfriend are going to join us. And you're with your girlfriend? So what does that make me? A fifth wheel? I'll just feel out of place. Then I'll set you up with a date if you want. [chuckles] No, thank you. I have lots to do. But happy birthday. [Angel] Apol, what you need is a social life. You can't be like that all the time. How old are you? 27? 28? I'm just 26. But you think like a 55-year-old. You only shuttle between work and home, that's it. What do you want me to do, Gel? Go with the mountaineers and climb the top of Mount Apo? Or go on Tinder and find a hunky date whose bicep is as big as my hips. I know! Keep posting on Instagram and go on Facebook live so I can get attention. Is that what you want? -Gel, I'm happy with my life right now. -I don't know with you. I swear. You're such a buzzkill. Apol, don't get offended by what I'm about to say. What now? The truth is, you're not really ugly. Thanks, I guess? You're just, you know, weird. You just need to doll yourself up a little. So you want to give me a makeover? Don't make a big deal out of nothing. [Apol] Just chill. [Angel] I'm just concerned. [Segundo] And there some people, who do not seek any change in their lives. They are already contented with the drudgery of life and just waiting for the unknown. [tranquil music] -[Apol] And in that precise of moment, -[keyboard clacking] when she arrived at that secret place, she found herself at peace. But all alone. But there was an air of excitement around her as she looked around, confused. [water splash] Not sure what to expect. But somehow certain that this is the place where her life will begin. [tranquil music] [Apol] So you two are back in each other's arms? Just yesterday, you wanted to lay a curse on your boyfriend. And now you're running back to him? I just gave him another chance. I felt sorry for him. You know how generous I am. I told you. Your cousin is a big-time flirt. [Mercy] So, have you decided? I don't know why you don't want to follow me here? What am I going to do there in Dubai? I'm sure your life will be better over here. You no longer have to make coffee all day or put cinnamons on the toaster. Ma, I have to go. Take care over there. [thuds] [Apol sighs] Then why don't you just get a boyfriend, right? Jeez! Why do people think that the solution to all women's problems is finding a boyfriend? [Freddie] Don't tell me you want a girlfriend. That darn lawyer is here again. [indistinct chatter] And they'll hang out here all afternoon. They're so loud and noisy. All they order is just one cup of coffee. And they will make it last until much later. I dare you to drive them away. No way. [indistinct chatter] Can I order one Americano and-- One mocha latte? You already know my order. That's all you order. -Edwin, right? -Yes. I told you. Over here. [Rio] Cuz, let's go. Troy is downstairs. He's going to treat us for pizza. [Apol] I'm busy. What do you get from posting your fantasies online? [Rio] Your romance novels. Come on, get a life! Go ahead, leave me alone. Stuff yourself with pizza. She's not coming with us again? She's busy writing her novel again. Oh, I thought you were going to tag your cousin along? [Rio] She doesn't want to come. She's busy with her laptop. [Troy] Why is your cousin so afraid of people? [Rio] Ever since Apol got broken-hearted, she kept avoiding people. I don't know what's up with that crazy woman. [Troy] Who's the guy? When did this happen? [keyboard clacking] [Rio] It was a long time ago. She was in her second year in high school. [Apol] Suddenly, she feels excitement in her soul. Her body trembles as she feels the heat in her blood run through her veins. As she slowly approaches, she knows that nothing will be the same. For the first time in her life, she will be truly alive. [Ipang] Apol, go with your cousin! I'm fine here! I'm still finishing something. Suit yourself. [door opens] You're late! Why don't you try walking on the railroad tracks from Cubao to Kamuning? -Hurry up! Apol's been looking for you. -[Freddie] Just a minute! Ouch! -Ouch! -Sorry, sorry! Why are you standing behind the door? -[groans] -I didn't mean to hit you. I'm sorry. What did I do to you? -Darn, it hurts. -Does it hurt? Why don't I try knocking your head on the door? Then tell me if it hurts. Why are you still here? There are customers waiting outside. Give me a minute. I feel a bit light-headed. [water fountain splashes] [biker] Hi, sexy! Piss off! Crazy! -[woman 1] Let's rest here. -[kid] Okay. -Hello. -Hello. Give me five. [door opens] Are you okay now? I'm sorry. Apol, I'm really sorry. Are you planning to hit my head again? Why are you so mean? You're going to end up a spinster with that attitude. What's wrong with that? Are you affected? What if I am? What's wrong with the two of you? The customers can hear you. -Cut it out. -Your friend here is so mean. -Then stop asking questions. -I already said sorry. She's so mean. I already said sorry. -[Freddie] I didn't mean it. -[door opens] [romantic music] [romantic music continues] [Ozzie] Hey, guys! What's up? -Ozzie, bro! -What's up, man? [laughter] Uh... Good morning. Can I take your order? Can I have one Americano and... What can you recommend? The lasagna here is good. [Ozzie] Are you sure? Super duper sure? Okay, I'll have one lasagna. -185 pesos, sir. -[Ozzie] 185. Um, may I take your name? Ozzie. O-Z-Z-I-E. [mouths] Ozzie. There. Thank you for giving an exact amount of 185 pesos. Thank you, Apol. You know my name? Yeah, I do. It's on your nametag. [chuckles] Oh, right. -Sorry. -Okay, no worries. Thank you, Ozzie. You told me your name. Oh, yeah, I did. [Angel] He's a new face here. Is he a law student, too? [Apol] For sure. He's with those guys. [Angel] Cute, isn't he? Is he your type? Shut up. Stop pretending. [Rio] Who are you looking for? [Apol] The guy I met at the caf√©. What's his name? Ozzie -Ozzie? -Ozzie. Don't you mean Oskie or Pochie? No! -What's his family name? -I don't know. You don't know his family name? Do I also need to know his police clearance? Or if he has a mental health disorder? Look him up on Facebook. [Apol] Rio, there are lots of Ozzie on Facebook. [Rio] What is his family name? [Apol] I told you, I don't know. [Rio] Then find it out. Hi, can I have one Americano and one cinnamon roll? One Americano and one cinnamon roll. -Name, please? -Ozzie. O-Z-Z-I-E. Family name? -Family name? -[scoffs] To be sure. -Are you serious? -It's company policy, sir. Relucio. Ozzie Relucio. So, was your stalking a success? I'm not stalking him. I'm just doing research. What did you discover about your dream boy? The good news or the bad? Start with the good. [Apol] He's intelligent, not just good-looking. There are good-looking guys. you just don't want to hear speak. [Rio laughs] You're so mean. [Rio] What's the bad news? [Apol] In a relationship. Darn it. [Rio] Maybe that's just nothing. [Apol] Why would they do that? So they won't attract gadflies. So they can avoid stalkers like you. Please, put this in there too. [chuckles] [Angel] Who's the cutest among the three? What kind of question is that? I pick Korean-looking guy. He looks like Lee Min-ho. Why don't we get your eyes checked? [Apol] Isn't it obvious? The cutest is the darker-skinned guy. [Angel] I'm right. You like Smiley. You guys are such flirts. Go back to work. What Smiley are you talking about? The one who's always smiling. [Freddie] Well, duh. That's why you called him Smiley. Shut up. Don't try to hide it. When Smiley's ordering, you have a twinkle in your eyes. You even have a glow on your face. What do you think of me? Christmas lights? Whatever. -[door opens] -[bell chimes] [tranquil music] -[Katski] This is a nice place. -Oh! -She's so pretty. -Who's that? -Let's go. -All right. -[man 1] Hey! -[Ozzie] Hi! What's up? How are you? -What's up, guys? -[Leah] Hi, guys! [Ozzie] What are you doing here? I saw Kat at school. Then she told me you guys are meeting up here. -So I joined her. -Yeah. What a beautiful surprise. Smiley's already taken. [Ozzie] Why didn't you tell me you were coming? -Then I would have ruined the surprise. -I love you. -Hi. What can I get you today? -Hi, Apol. Can I have one orange juice? Do you only have orange juice? [Apol] We also have pineapple. That's it? Do you have raspberry? Sorry, ma'am. We don't have that. Hmm... [Ozzie] Orange juice? You know, the Philippine Constitution does not put an age limit to flirting. I'm not flirting. I just appreciate him. Cuz, that's the same thing. Remember, she's just his girlfriend. Okay? The Church has not sanctified their union yet. So, what are you trying to say? You still have a chance. [chuckles] So you want me to steal him away like a snake? -I'm not Galema, child of Zuma! -[chuckles] If Galema's happy, then so be it! All is fair in love and war. Even with snakes. [Rio] Cuz, you will get nothing from staring at your dream boy the whole day. We live in the Digital Age. Believe in female empowerment. Remember, #HandsUp. What's your problem? You're the one who has a problem. You're spacing out. What's up with you? [indistinct chatter] [jabbers] You're annoying. Mister. Apol, what do you need? For you. What's this? It's about to expire. But you can still eat it. It's a waste if I'm just going to throw it away. How sweet of you. Mister, have you repaired it? Just come back for it tomorrow. It's fine. I was just trying my luck. Mister, I'll go ahead. Hey, wait. Do I know you? You're... -Apol. -Apol! And you're Ozzie. You know my name? And also, your usual order. Americano or lasagna. Polka Dot Caf√©, right? I knew it. That was you. Small world. -Sir! -Yes? Come back for it after 30 minutes. [Ozzie] Thirty minutes? -Can't I get it now? -Mister, I'll go ahead. -Thanks for the snack, Apol. -Take care. -Take care too. -Can't I get it after 15 minutes? [tranquil music] -[waitress] Excuse me, ma'am. -[plate thuds] Here's your hot bun and noodles with iced tea. -Thank you. -Thank you. [Ozzie] Thank you, Miss. Apol? Apol, is that you? Hey, it's you again! Are you with someone? -May I? -Huh? May I sit with you, if it's okay? Sit down. Nice. Great. Nice. Nice. My back hurts. So, what are you reading? May I see? Hm? Ah! Okay. I see. Love story. Oh, Young Adult. Am I right? -Mm. -Bingo. Actually, this is the stuff my sister likes to read. [chuckles] You're not much of a talker, aren't you? What do you want me to say? Anything. It's up to you. Family? Love life? No, it's a joke. Okay. Tell me more about yourself. [romantic music] -[Rio] What is it, Aunt? -[Ipang] It's your cousin! Apol! Apol, why are you blasting the music so loud? [upbeat music] [Apol gibbers] Apol, darn you. What did you snort? Rio, I'm so ecstatic! Do you know what time it is? You won't believe what happened to me earlier. We're friends. Who? Ozzie. Spill the tea. -[squeals] -Ouch. So, what happened? Ozzie and I are now close. How did that happen? How many grams of coffee did he order from you? You don't believe me. How long have you been working at the caf√©? -Almost two years. -Two years. College graduate? AB Humanities in UST. AB Humanities? If you took AB Humanities, you work at the caf√©, I mean no offense. You didn't get a different job? Why are you working at the caf√©? I do something else. I'm also a writer. Oh, okay. What do you write? Novel. So you're a novelist. You told him about the stories you write online? He asked for it. Give me some of your amazing titles. -Maybe I've read some of them. -Probably not. Try me. I'm sure I know your work. Um, the first one is... Love at First Smile. No. You have a second novel? The second is I Dated a Teenage Vampire. Doesn't ring a bell. Where can I buy a copy of your books? There's no hard copy. It's just posted online. And I don't use my real name. Nobody uses their real name anymore. So what's your pen name? Um... Scarlett Veronique. Hm, Scarlett Veronique? Just to make it sound mysterious. Hm... Interesting. -That's all he said? Interesting? -Mm-hm. -He's just being polite, stupid! -I don't think so. He's interested in me. Interested and interesting are not the same. [Ozzie] Okay. Thank you for the company, Scarlett Veronique. Okay. Good night. Take care. [Apol] Yes! [squeals] [chuckles] [Rio] Did he ask for your phone number? Did you ask for his phone number? E-mail address? Why would I ask for his e-mail address? Okay. That's all you have to say? [Rio] I'll just wait for the next chapter. [chattering] Hi. Hey, dude. What's up? I think Smiley has a problem. All his friends are so quiet. I wonder what happened. Move away. -Ouch! Don't push! -Get out of here. -[Ozzie] Hi. -Hi. How are you? I'm good. Can I have one latte, please? You don't want Americano? No. For a change. We have lasagna. It's really good. Hm... I'm good. [somber music] [Angel] He hasn't come here for days. Why are you monitoring him? Apol, what happened to Smiley? I don't know. I'm not his secretary. Look! Smiley's here! -Where? Where? -He's gone now. [Rio] How long has it been? [Apol] It's been three days. [Rio] Maybe he's just busy. [Apol] I haven't seen his friends, too. [Rio] Classmates? [Apol] They haven't been at the caf√© for a while. [Rio] Maybe they found a new hangout place. Or maybe they got sick of your coffee and pastries. You can be harsh sometimes. Cuz, he's just a crush. He's not your boyfriend. The only quality time you had was watching him eat sharksfin dumplings and beef brisket. There's nothing for you to move on from. [somber music] [Apol] And at that moment of their tight embrace, she feels his body being pulled away from hers. As they struggle to hold on to each other, there is a force that pulled him away. A force so strong that it shattered her. [somber music] -Hi, mister. -Apol, just a sec. -You know Ozzie Relucio, right? -[Apol] Yes. He asked me to repair his watch. I was able to repair it the day you two met here. But he hasn't picked it up yet. It's already been paid. I tried calling him on his phone, but I can't get through to him. Let's try calling him again. There. [automated voice] The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. Maybe you can help me. [Segundo] Here's his address. [somber music] -Hi. Yes? -[Apol] Hello. I have something for one of your residents. Ozzie Relucio. Hold on a moment. Mister Relucio of 712. There's no one in his unit right now because he stepped out about two hours ago. But if you like, you can leave the package with me, so they can forward it to him when he comes back. [Apol] I can't just leave it here. This is quite important. Maybe he's at-- Where is this again? -Sorry, I can't let you in. -Apol? -Hi, sir. -Hey. -Hi. -Hello. What are you doing here? I just came here to return your watch. -The one you left at the repair shop. -Wait. What? You came all the way here to return that to me? Why don't you come up with me at my condo? I have to get ready. I already stink. Maybe you're hungry. You want some food? I just went here to give this to you. No, please. It's the least I can do. -[door opens] -Okay, welcome to my crib. Feel at home. Please close the door. Come in. I'm just here to return this to you. No, it's okay. Come on. You're safe here. Relax! -[door closes] -[Troy] He said Apol is safe? [Rio] Yes. What does it mean when a guy says it? -He said you're safe in his condo? -Mm. That could only mean friendzone. Wow! [Ozzie] My sister and I live here. But she's not here. She went home to our beautiful Grandma in CDO. Mmm. I need to go in a while. [Ozzie] Why? You still have work? No, it's my rest day today. -[Ozzie] Okay, I see. -That's why... What? -Water? -Huh? By the way, thank you so much for bringing the watch I asked Mister Segundo to repair. You're so helpful. I really appreciate it. He said you didn't come back for it. And I haven't seen you or your friends at the caf√©. Did you guys get tired of our coffee? Or the pastries? [Ozzie] Of course not. Let's just say I lied low for a bit. Ah, are you trying to avoid them? Not exactly. I just had a lot in mind lately. -I'll go ahead. -Apol, wait. Can I ask you something? [Troy] What did he ask you? About his girlfriend. Ouch. I feel like... Leah... is still in love with her ex-boyfriend. The one before me. Oh. -[Katski] Leah, are you okay? -Leah, talk to me! -Stop being so childish! -I don't want this anymore! -Suit yourself! -Let's go. Take that crazy woman home! [Leah] Why does he hurt me so much? -That's enough. -Because you let him. [Apol] No wonder you're so madly in love with her. You instantly fell in love because you felt sorry for her. She's a battered girlfriend. If you say so. -But-- -But what? [Leah] You really are such a nice guy. How come you don't have a girlfriend? I don't want to have a girlfriend just for the sake of having one. I want someone whom I can truly love. Give me your phone. Huh? Give it to me. Here. There. What's this? If Matthew and I break up, and I become available, I'll give you permission to make a move. Bye, Ozzie. [car door closes] [Apol] No wonder you fell hard for her. She wrapped you around her fingers. Ouch. But you have a point. I'm so stupid. [scoffs] To think I'm an honor student. Everyone becomes stupid when it comes to love. You're right. But I admire you. How come you know a lot about love? How many boyfriends have you had? None. None? You mean zero? You're kidding me. Mmm? [laughs] How come you speak like you've had a lot of experience? Just because I never had a boyfriend, doesn't mean I've never been in love. [Rio] So, what did he tell you? His girlfriend lured him to her trap. Then Ozzie fell for it. There are girls like that. They take advantage of people's weakness. [Rio] And Ozzie was stupid enough to fall for it. [dial tone ringing] [Leah] Hello? Hello. Hi. Did I wake you up? [Leah] Who's this? Sorry, this is Oz. [Leah] Why just now? -You're really... -What do you mean? [Leah] Matthew and I broke up. What? [Ozzie] She told me it's over. But I caught her texting Matthew. And she's still wearing the necklace her ex gave her. Come on, man! [scoffs] Sorry. I'm dumping my emotions on you. Sorry about that. You might get the wrong impression of me. No, it's not like that. So after he opened up to you, that's all you said? Not only that. You need to have trust. If there's no trust, then why are you two still together? You said you had a lot of girlfriends. Are you still in contact with them? Yes. Facebook. Text. But that's about it. Well, you're no different after all. Who gives you the right to cast suspicions on your girlfriend? That's unfair. Aren't you stupid? Why would you say that to him? That's all right. There's a moral lesson behind this. Moral lesson? So, you're encouraging him to go after his girlfriend? The plan was to steal him away from her. Steal him away? Fine, then settle for friendzone. I'll give you two options. Become BFFs with your dream boy? Or enjoy a bit of a dirty relationship with him? I'm okay with being a little dirty, but not too much. Suit yourself. Can I say something? Go ahead. You have permission to talk. That girl is just playing with her boyfriend's feelings. [Angel] I miss them, too. Even though they can be sometimes annoying. Who do you miss? The noisy law students. Then make friends with the med students. [scoffs] I don't like them. They're snobs. I like the law students more. Maybe they don't like our coffee anymore. I don't think our coffee is the problem. It's the Wi-Fi. They keep complaining they can't download. The Internet's too slow. -Apol, look! -[bell chimes] [tranquil music] Hi. What are you doing here? And where is your study group? Actually, I came here for you. [chuckles] [Apol] Destiny. What destiny has planned, no one can change. For her, that was magic. Finally, she found what took so long to find. [Ozzie] I would like to personally... thank you. What for? Because... Leah and I are now okay. [Apol] What is meant to be... Damn that destiny! [Ozzie] You were right. Trust is the key. And I told Leah. And it makes a lot of sense. Apol, thank you. -You're welcome. -Thank you, thank you. [Rio] So, what did you get out of it? Nothing. Cuz, it's confirmed. You're officially stupid. Look at what happened. Their love team is stronger than ever. Fine, Rio. You're right. So give me some slack. You were on the right track. But you had to derail it. [Apol] I'm just going to write about it and upload it on Scarlett Veronique. [Rio] Cuz. Cuz, let's be real here. There's nothing much going on for you. Unless, you realize that there's plenty of people out there. So, what are you trying to say? Go out! Have some fun! Have yourself deflowered, for crying out loud. It's been scientifically proven that the longer you wait before having sex, poses a health risk. You really have a filthy mouth. Excuse me, I'm just being scientific. Cuz, us girls have a biological time clock. But as we get older, the battery loses its power. Rio, I'm just 26. Fully-charged. Five bars. I'm still good to go. But until when, cuz? Until when? -Gel, I have a question. -What is it? What do you do after your shift? Why do you ask? I think it's time... I think it's time to be alive, right? What the heck are you saying? You're weirding me out. Stay here. I'll just go to the restroom. Wait for Choi. I don't know what your boyfriend looks like. I've already introduced him to you three times. And he knows you. I'll just go to the restroom. [playful music] I thought you were not coming. He kept asking me questions. Why don't you tell him already? Please, let's not talk about it here. Let's go before someone catches us together. Oh, Jesus! Holy Mother of Child! [Ipang] Apolonia, what are you doing there? I thought a thief got inside our house. Jesus. What's wrong? Is there a problem? Are you crying? Did you get fired from work? Were you robbed? Was your cell phone taken away? [Apol sobs] Jesus Christ. Don't tell me your cousin is pregnant. Aunt Ips, why would I cry over Rio's pregnancy? I'm quite sure you won't get depressed over a boy. You're so judgmental. You're crying over a boy? It would be weird if I cried over a girl. You shouldn't cry over a boy, Apolonia. You should be the one making them cry. Your lines are straight out of a movie. [sobs] Whatever you're dealing with, I have a solution to that. [bottles clinking] Where did this come from? And whose is this? Who's the judgmental now? [Ipang] Cheers! You know, you and I are so much alike. I hope not. You know, I also had my... one... true love. Maybe I was your age or younger. So what happened to your one true love? Well, isn't it obvious? I ended up a dried-up spinster. Why didn't you two end up together? I wasted my time like you. I didn't want to be called a slut or a whore. -Pakakak! -Pakakak? That's why... I still love Lennon. But I cowered away. I was too afraid to say... "It's okay." "It's okay." What do you mean? It's okay for him to lust over me. It's okay for him to lose a little bit of respect for me. You know what I mean. I get it, Aunt. But... I worried about what other people would think of me. I didn't think about what he wanted. So, I let him slip away. [sobbing] So, where is this Lennon now? In New Jersey with his wife and children. You should see his wife. She's a fat cow now! They have two grandchildren now. They have a good life together. Aunt, you have a good life too. Do you want me to hit you? Look at me! Aunt, you're beautiful. Thank you. At least I know what's best for me. And I've already decided on what to do. [Segundo] They say that opportunity is fleeting. It knocks only once. And if you don't take it, you miss the chance. -[Apol] Hi, good morning. -Hi, good morning. Is Ozzie Relucio in here? Hold on. Yes, he's at his unit. -Let me just call him. -Mm-hm. -[keypad beeping] -[dial tone ringing] -[Ozzie] Hello, yes? -Hi, sir. You have a guest downstairs. -Her name is... -Apol. Miss Apol. [Ozzie] Okay! Let her in. Okay, sir. All right. 712. [knock on door] [Ozzie] Hey, Apol. What are you doing here? Am I bothering you? No. Please, come in. -What's up? -Are you going out today? Yes. I'm going to Baguio. Baguio? Yeah. With Katski, Jojo, and Leah. Just a random road trip. Is it your girlfriend's idea? Yes, ma'am. Why, what's up? Um... Ozzie, I need to tell you something. But I hope you don't get mad. Okay. What is it about? It's about what? Um, about your girlfriend. What about Leah? I just want you to know that-- [cell phone ringing] Excuse me. It's Leah. Hello, Leah? [Leah] Oz, what time are you picking me up? I'll pick you up by 6:00 p.m. so we can be in Baguio by midnight. Why? -Is there something wrong? -[Leah] Not really. But won't we get stuck in traffic if we leave by six? And the route extends all the way to Bulacan. Can we leave a bit later? Okay. I'll just tell Katski and Jojo. What time do you want me to pick you up? -[Leah] Probably nine. -Nine? That's too late. At least we avoided the traffic. Okay, I'll pick you up by nine. But be ready by that time, okay? [Leah] Okay. See you. -Okay, bye. -[Leah] Bye. So, what were you about to tell me? Um... I just wish you and your girlfriend the best. That's it? [chuckles] You came all the way here just to tell me that? Yes. Are you sure that's it? Is there something more? I'll be late for work. I need to go. Take care. [Ozzie] Apol, hold up. Are you sure that's it? Shit. Stupid! -[Ozzie] Hey, babe. -[Leah] Hi, babe. Let me get your stuff. How are you? I'm good. Where's Katski? Katski has some paperwork to do. She and Jojo will follow us there tomorrow. Too bad. I thought we're all going to go together. Um, babe, is that Polo Blue? Are you wearing men's perfume? Of course not. Oz, why are you going around smelling people like that? [Leah] What are you? K-9 trained? [car door opens] -[car door closes] -[thunder rumbling] [somber music] [exhales sharply] -[door opens] -[bell chimes] [door opens] Apol, have you heard the news? You're such a gossip. We're not yet sure if it's really him. Apol, what's Smiley's full name again? Aren't you friends with him and his girlfriend? I'm not that close with Smiley. -But... -What's his full name? Ozzie. Ozzie Relucio. What's his first name? Oswald. Did he and his girlfriend go to Baguio together? How did you know? Apol, there was a news report on the radio. There was a car accident in La Union. The driver's name is Oswald Relucio. She was with a girl. His name is familiar, that's why Angel reacted. And the report said he was a law student... [customer] Can I take my order now? -Sorry, sir. Angel. -Okay. [Angel] Sir, what's your order? [somber music] [Apol] For every decision made, there are chances surrendered, and opportunities missed. For every road taken, there is also a destination that is replaced, and then forgotten. All it took for her was one moment of indecision one moment of fear, one moment of hesitation. And suddenly, her world changed. What she thought were the tomorrows waiting for her became an incomplete yesterday of life and love that will remain forever unfulfilled. Suddenly, she found herself -all alone, again. -[knocks on door] [Rio] Cuz, are you all right? I'm coming in. I want to be left alone. What's going on with you? Aunt said you've been locking yourself up in your room lately. I don't want to talk about it. Is it about that law student you're crazy about? I told you to let him go. It's a lost cause. That's enough. He's dead. Oh, my god. I went to his condo. If only I had told him what his girlfriend did, he should not have-- Wait, wait, wait! Are you blaming yourself for his death? [Rio] Stop playing the victim card. Hey! Hey! It's not your fault, okay? Apol, Apol! It's been a while. How are you? Not that all right. How come? You remember Ozzie? Whose watch you asked me to deliver to his home. Mister... He's dead. Huh? How did he die? He and his girlfriend went to Baguio. They didn't notice that there was a six-wheeler truck in front of them. Ozzie was driving fast. Who would have thought that would be the end for them? That's the thing. There's no more second chance. If only we could have prevented it from happening. But... But what? I was too much of a coward. If only I told Ozzie what I needed to tell him the day he left, he would still be alive. Apol, who told you there is no more second chance? I am going to give this to you. The most important thing in the world is time. We can no longer go back to our past. The present is happening now. And tomorrow is uncertain. But this watch is different. How is it different? It has the power to take you to the time when you want to start over. Are you for real? I'm telling the truth. What's that? A time machine? Call it what you want. It goes like this. [Segundo] Turn the watch counterclockwise. Then close your eyes and think of the moment in your past you want to go back to. Are you serious? You don't believe me? You think I'm pulling your leg? Try it. [exhales sharply] [clicking] I wish... I wish I could go back to the time when... [playful music] [biker] Hi, sexy! Piss off! This guy... Hey! Are you still feeling light-headed? Apol, I'm really sorry. I'm fine, don't worry about it. You're so grumpy. You're going to end up a spinster with that attitude. What is it to you? Are you affected? -What if I am? -What's going on with you two? The customers can hear you. Your friend here is so grumpy. -I already apologized. -That's enough. Why am I here again? -She's so grumpy. I said I'm sorry. -[Angel] That's enough. -[Freddie] She's so grumpy. -[door opens] [upbeat music] [Ozzie] Hey, guys! -What's up, Ozzie? -Hey, bro! Yeah, boy! Hi! Can I have one American and-- Our best-seller here is the lasagna. Okay. I'll have one lasagna then. 185 pesos. You're not going to ask for my name? Ozzie? How do you know? I just heard your friends calling your name. Okay. You have an excellent hearing. Here. Thank you for giving 185 pesos. Thank you, Apol. Sure, Ozzie. [Ozzie] Great. Thanks. [Apol] Mister! What time is Mister Segundo coming back? He didn't come in today. His shop is closed today. Is that so? Thank you. [Apol] If you know something bad is going to happen to a person, do you need to tell it to them? Of course. I don't want to let anything bad happen to them. How sure are you that your friend is in danger? He's going to die. Damn! [coughs] Someone's going to kill him? Road accident. Hm... Cuz, how do you know? I just do. It's hard to explain. So, should I tell him or not? Think about it, Madam Auring. Good morning. What can I get you today? Hey, Apol. Can I have one orange juice, please? Do you only have orange juice? We also have pineapple. That's it? Do you have raspberry? I said, we only have pineapple. Why are you looking for something else? Leah, what do you want? Orange juice or pineapple? I wanted raspberry. But since they don't have it, I'll have orange juice then. Uh, okay, one orange juice. Keep the change. What's wrong with you? That's not the proper way to treat the customers. That girl is no good for Ozzie. Huh? You just met the girl just now. Just trust me. She is a terrible person. Mister, mister! Did Ozzie drop by? Who are you looking for? Ozzie. He brought his watch here for repair. -You were the one who-- -Mister. Hi, Ozzie. Hi. Do I know you? Apol. You're Ozzie. Yeah. You remember me. You're one of our regular customers at Polka Dot Caf√©. That's why I remember you. -[Segundo] Sir -[Ozzie] Yes? Come back for it after 30 minutes. Ozzie, are you hungry? Let's eat. Come on. -[waitress] Excuse me. Here's your order. -Oh, my favorite. Your noodles and utensils. -Thanks, miss. -[waitress] Enjoy your meal. How long have you been working at the caf√©? Almost two years. And I'm a graduate of AB Humanities at UST. Okay. And I'm also a writer. -Oh, a writer. -I'm a novelist. -Novelist. -[Apol] Mm-hm. My first novel is Love at First Smile. Then my second novel is I Dated a Teenage Vampire. They don't have a hard copy. They're just posted online. And I don't use my real name. Because nobody does that anymore. My pen name is Scarlett Veronique. Sounds mysterious, right? -[Ozzie] Yeah. -Scarlett Veronique. Sounds like a porn star. Beautiful, right? [utensils clank] [chuckles] Thank you for the company. Good night. Ozzie, Ozzie! Can I get your phone number? So we can exchange messages. -Uh, okay, sure. Give me your phone. -Here you go. And then, I'll... Um... I'll call your number. Or just reply to my text message. Sure. Thank you. -Good night. -Good night. I'll text you! Uh, yeah. Good night! [Rio] Are you crazy? Why did you do that? He might think you're a lunatic. You don't understand. I'm trying to save his life. Cuz, tell me the truth. I won't rat you out to our aunt or the PDEA. But are you taking any illegal drugs? Shut up. Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? OMG! You're going to text him? He gave me his number. Suit yourself. -[keypad clacking] -[scoffs] [cell phone beeps] [keypad clacking] -[cell phone beeps] -He replied. Cuz, that's a major turnoff. You're scaring him off. [Apol] I don't know what's up with him. Babe, sorry. -Who are you texting at this time? -Uh... Nothing. Don't worry about it. What do you mean nothing? How did she get your number? Babe, it's nothing. Okay? Don't worry about it. Then why do you keep replying? Okay, I won't reply anymore. He didn't text back. Okay. Got the message? Just stop what you're doing, for crying out loud. [Jojo] Guys, we have this thing due on Tuesday, okay? -Remember, the project is due on Tuesday. -Yeah, I know. -It's about-- -Hey. -Oh... -[Angel] I think Smiley has a problem. His friends went silent all of a sudden. I wonder what's the problem. Move away. -[Angel] Ouch! -[Apol] I can handle this. [tranquil music] Hi. You aren't replying to my text messages. I'm just kinda busy right now. Ozzie, just... take it easy. Okay? There are a lot of girls out there. Sorry? I mean, she's not the only girl in the world. Let's fix this. All right? Guys, can we find a different venue next time? What's the problem with this venue? Yeah. The cashier lady. I really find her weird. It's obvious she has a crush on you. [giggles] -I told you. -Super. -I noticed it, too. -She's madly in love with you. Keep it down. -Mister. -Apol, how are you? Mister, I'll return Ozzie's watch myself. The one he brought here for repair. He asked you to pick it up? Yes. It's already been paid for, right? He wasn't able to pick it up last time. Tell him that I've been calling him on his number. -But he's not picking up my calls. -His phone is not working. His address is written here. I've already been there. I'll go ahead. Miss, I told you Mister Relucio is not here. He stepped out about two hours ago. He won't come back here anytime soon. [Apol] He's on his way back. I told you he's not here. You can come back next time. -I told you. -Hi, sir. She's been looking for you. Wait. What are you doing here? How did you find out where I live? I just came here to return your father's watch. You left it at the repair shop. Okay... -Thanks. -Thanks. Anyway, thank you. -Bye. -Ozzie! Ozzie, can I use your restroom? I just have a bit of an emergency. -Emergency. -Yeah, sure. -The restroom is over there. -Okay. [sighs] [heavy breathing] I can do this! What am I doing to myself? [light music] Are you done? Can I get a glass of water? I just feel thirsty right after I pee. Yeah, yeah. Your condo is so cute. -It's cute. -Thanks. -Is it just you and your sister here? -[Ozzie] Sister? Yeah, it's just the two of us here. When is she coming back from Cagayan de Oro? How do you know my sister is in CDO? I don't remember telling anybody. Anyway, never mind. By the way, thank you for bringing my watch. Do you have work? Maybe you need to go? No, it's my rest day today. -That's why I'm here. -[Ozzie] Oh, it's your rest day. I still have lots to do. My parents are coming over. Uh, Ozzie. Yeah? Trust your instinct, okay? [Apol] Whatever suspicions you might have, investigate on it. She might be nice and cute on the outside. Fine, let's give it to her. Apol, what are you talking about? You're busy, right? I might be getting in the way of your work. I'll go ahead. Thank you. [Rio] I thought I was the crazy one. But you are crazier! Maybe it runs in the blood. Yeah, but hers is worse. -My god. -You think what I did was wrong? You're beyond stupid. Apol, give yourself a favor. Stop it. You're freaking the guy out. I don't know why your loins are on fire every time you see that guy. You don't get it. His life is in danger. Gel, do you and your boyfriend have any plans after your shift? Yes. Why? Can I come with you guys? I want to go to the mall. I don't know if Choi wants to go to the mall. -He said he just wants to eat outside. -No. I'm pretty sure he wants to go to the mall. Apol, I'll just go to the restroom. Wait for Choi here. Hey! Why are you so tense? I'm fine. Go to the ladies' room. -Just wait for me. -Okay, go! [tense music] I thought you weren't going to come. Why don't you tell him already? Please, let's not talk about it here. Let's go before someone catches us together. Miss, what are you doing? Come back, come back. I'm going to Ozzie Relucio's unit. You can't just walk in here like that. Mister Relucio gave us an instruction to ban you here. He had me banned? Obviously. [keypad beeping] [Ozzie] Hello. Yes? Sir, we have a problem here. Miss Apol is downstairs. Didn't I leave clear instructions to you? [receptionist] I know, sir. -But she said this is an emergency. -Give me that. -Hello, Ozzie. -Wow, you're really something. I know you're going to Baguio today. But please give me five minutes. I need to tell you something important. [door opens] -[Ozzie] Yes? -Sorry if I'm bothering you. Um... I know you have a scheduled trip to Baguio today. Yeah, I'm going to Baguio today. What's the problem? I just need to tell you something. But please don't get mad. What? About your girlfriend. Leah? -She's cheating on you. -What? I know this is weird, but-- -Do you know Leah? -No, but-- So why are you saying she's cheating on me? -You don't even know her. -[cell phone ringing] -That's Leah calling. -What? [cell phone ringing] Hello, Leah. [Leah] Oz, what time are you picking me up? I'll pick you up by 6:00 p.m. so we can be in Baguio by midnight. Why? [Leah] Can we leave at 9 p.m.? Okay. I'll just tell Katski and Jojo we'll leave a bit later. -[Leah] Okay, sure. -9:00 p.m.? Isn't that too late? [Leah] No, 9:00 p.m. is okay. -Okay, so be ready by nine. -[Leah] Okay, okay. -Okay? -[Leah] Okay! -Bye. -[Leah] Bye. Apol, I think you need to leave. I know you and your girlfriend are happy together. [Apol] But believe me. -She's cheating on you. -Apol. She's seeing another guy. Apol, you don't know my girlfriend. Please get out. You don't know her. [Ozzie] Where did you get this? [Apol] I saw her at the mall. I recognized Leah because you're always with her at the caf√©. -Then I saw her with that guy. -Get out! Ozzie, you don't understand. If you go with her to Baguio, you'll get into an accident. What? I don't get you. You're both going to get into a road accident. -Then what? -You're both going to die! What? Maybe I sound like a crazy person right now. -But trust me on this. -What are you talking about? You're not a fortune teller! Who are you to say that? -Yes, I'm not a fortune teller! But-- -But what? But I know it will happen! We had this conversation before. Stop, okay! God, you're crazy! Get out now! -Please believe me. -No, I don't believe you! -Please, believe me. -Get out, get out. -I'm telling the truth. -Get out, get out. What are you saying? Get out! -You're going to die. -I'm going to call security. Please, believe me. -You're going to get into an accident. -Get out. -I don't want you to die. -Apol, get out! -Please believe me. -Out! -I'm telling the truth. -Out! -Please, hear me out. -Get out of here! -[Apol] Please believe me. -[Ozzie] Out! -[Apol] I don't want you to die. -[door closes] Yes? [clears throat] Where's Mister Segundo? Grandpa? He can't come today. When is he coming back? Uh, I can't say for sure. Did you leave something with him? I just need to talk to him. That's quite impossible. He had a stroke. Huh? When did this happen? We were just walking together the other day. Then he just went... [panting] We brought him to the hospital. We rushed him to the ER. But he still hasn't woken up yet. I don't think that's possible. He gave me a watch before. What does it look like? It's a centuries-old pocket watch. He was repairing it. Hold on. Is this what you're talking about? Beautiful, isn't it? Segundo Special. But it's not working yet. Grandpa had been working on it before I was even born. But he doesn't have the pieces or the time for it. [Apol] There is no way you can change destiny. What's meant to be is what's meant to be. And what cannot be will never be. For some are better left as dreams. Because even though how hard you try, they can never be real. Because that is your destiny. Apol, aren't you going to have dinner? [keypad clacking] What's going on with you? Why are you skipping meals? I'm just writing something. Romance novel again? Yes, but it has a tragic ending. About what? About lost chances. Even though you turn back time, you can't get them back. Because it's not part of your destiny. Apolonia, do you know what I learned after I got my Senior Citizen card? What will be will be. That's destiny. You cannot change it however you like. So learn to accept it and be thankful for what you have. Hm? [somber music] [door opens] [sighs] [door opens] Hey! You're spacing out again. Get to work. Go get changed. Gel, don't you have any news for me? About what? The news report on the radio. About what? [bell chimes] Oh, my gosh. Look who's here. [chuckles] [gasps] Hey, look! Such a flirt. Hi. Can I talk to you? You cancelled your Baguio trip? Obviously not. Because I'm here talking to you. [Apol] What happened? Everything you told me was true. -[Ozzie] Are you excited? -[Leah] Yeah. I'm good. Where's Katski? Is that Polo Blue? Is that men's perfume? Why are you going around smelling people like that? Leah, were you with Matthew? Because someone saw you together at the mall. Are you lying to me? [Ozzie] When I smelled Leah's perfume, I knew you were telling the truth. And I also remembered Matthew's perfume because he was my ex-best friend. [sighs] So what does that have to do with... Let's just say Matthew has a habit of spraying cologne on his women. Like a... Like a dog marking his territory. Thank you. Thank you for believing me. No. Thank you. Thank you for telling me the truth. [Segundo] Not all people are given a second chance. Because we cannot change the course of time. Some people spend their lives waiting to get what they want. While others seem to be always running out of time. They always rush through things. Some relationships strengthen and deepen as months and years go by. While other couples get sick and tired of each other. Their relationships do not work anymore. But whatever they say... [Apol] Why did you bring me here? I just want to show you my most favorite place in the world. Look. [chuckles] Come with me. [Apol] Oh, my god. Oh, my god. It's true! It's true! [Ozzie] Have you been here? Hey. Emotional? Because all the while... it's always been true. It's all true. [Segundo] Every precious time given to us should be valued and treasured. That's the beauty and mystery of our borrowed lives. ["Gilid" by Moonstar88 playing]
