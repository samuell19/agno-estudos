Continuing with the STIC test or Standardised Test for International Colleges, which tests general knowledge and... is used to apply to bachelor programmes in the U. S. This year the association overseeing the examination has uncovered a cheating scandal, which has led to an exam leak in various countries in Asia. Further investigation is pending... Jt's not mine. My name is Rinrada NiJthep. I'm in grade 12 at Krungthep Thaweepanya School. You can call to check my school records. The STIC exam isn't beyond my ability. BAD GENIUS Student Portfolio: Ms Rinrada Nilthep 4.00 GPA. Grade 7, Academic Year 2011 GRADE 9 Straight A's since Grade 1. Honour student since Grade 7 to Grade 9. Came in first place in the school district's Maths Competition. National Crossword Champion. Also achievements in sports... this one is... swimming. You don't have to say anything else. This is enough. No need to ask whether we would accept Lynn or not. The important question is... do you want to study here? What do you say, honey? I don't have to decide now, right? It's not that I don't want to study here. It's just that my old school is more suitable for me. If I move here, my dad... will have to pay almost 150K per year. Why 150K? One semester is only 60K, so it only comes up to 120K. Correct. However, my dad teaches at my old school, so in the mornings I can go with him. If I study here, I'd have to take the skytrain including the motortaxi from the station is 80 baht per day... for 8 months, which is 170 days, excluding holidays. It's approximately 13,600 baht per year. There's also lunch, it costs only 20 baht for 2 sides with rice. Here it's 35 baht. I'll also have to buy new school supplies and uniforms. I think all in all... it might not be worth it. Gold medal in maths. Honey... I can afford it. No, you can't. What if you study for free? Vit, I'll add the free lunch programme too, okay? You see, our school does value how smart Lynn is. Now. Is it worth it? Yes. Worth bringing all this. It's worth it, right? Letter of Authorisation Lynn GRADE 10 Done. Wait! We've gotta use this ID for 3 years. Gotta look good. Okay? You're a new student, right? I'm Grace. I'm Lynn. What? Can I have a look? Take off your glasses. Trust me. Pretty! Smile. C'mon. Okay. Ready 1... 2. Go. You're next. Hurry. Grace My ID is after hers, so we've sat together for 3 years. Lynn and I are besties. Everyone says Lynn's extra smart. Me... well... I'm good at extracurricular activities. I'm pretty sure people think I'm stupid. The Headmistress came up with a new policy. To be in a school play, you need at least a 3.25 GPA. Why? Am I too stupid to be in a play? I think... acting is harder than studying. Really? Yeah. Look, I've been tutoring with Mr Sophon for weeks, but I still don't know shit. And maths really pulls my grades down. The answer is C. What! You got the answer just by glancing? Upside down too! Super easy. Union A with B, intersect with C. Do the one's in the parentheses first, then intersect with C is just whatever's left in C. That's the answer. Oh! I got it. Scholarship kids are the bomb. Another problem? Lynn, will you be my tutor? Why not? If you teach me, I'll buy you a milkshake after school every day. Nah. You'll get to review the lesson every evening. Not enough. What about... If you agree, I'll get to be your first student, Mentor Lynn. Mentor Lynn. Mentor Lynn. Mentor Lynn. I like it. I'll teach you all of this today. Grace told you I helped with her studies? She's right. But, tutoring my friend isn't wrong, right? It's the time you've been waiting for. MIDTERMS Pass the test paper. That's enough. Take a deep breath, clear your mind. It's crystal clear. Students, you may start the exam. Maths: 60 questions /30 marks Mathematics... I've warned you before, it isn't easy. If you know you don't understand and you still don't come tutor with me, it's too late now. Kiss your grade goodbye. Grace. The paper is exactly like Mr Sophon's sheets! - Yeah! - You can do it, right? No. Why not? I already taught you! I can't remember. Why are you two talking?! No questions, no cheating! I won't tolerate any nonsense in my exam room. Ms Rinrada Nilthep Grace. The answers. Should I write my name on the scrap paper? Of course! Haven't you ever taken a test? Sorry, sir. (acbddcbaaa...) Student Report Card 3.87! 3.87! 3.87! How about you? What did you get? Easy 4. Are you free tomorrow? Let's celebrate. Sure. Where? Let's got to Pat's then. Convenient. You've got a swimsuit, right? Pat, will it kill you to just get in normally? Nope... but it's not cool. Ouch! I got water in my ear. Mr Pat, dinner is served. Just leave it. Babe, I'm cold. Pat Grace, are you looking for coral? I've told Grace to invite you over many times. We're all in the same class, but we hardly ever talk. Grace though... always Lynn this... Lynn that. Shut up. Are you jealous? Grace always says that you're so smart. Without you, her grades wouldn't have improved. I even told her that... I want to have a bestie like you. I've seen you have lots of friends. You're right, but no one lends me their eraser during exams. Why? You also want to be in the school play? Smart people like you don't understand. Thickheads like me, all want good grades. Damn. Babe! If I don't fail, Dad will get me a new car. Sounds good? I know that we aren't tight... but if you agree... I'll pay you 3K per subject. Per person. Per person? Yeah. What do you mean? I've got 5 more friends. What if the teachers find out? Don't worry about that. All my friends can be trusted. Everyone is willing to pay. Think about it, this is only one subject. How many subjects in one semester? Not including PE... 13? So in one exam season, you'll get... 13 times... 234,000 baht. Nice digits 234,000. In exchange for your brains. Tick-Tock. Call it even for the school's 'tea money'. What tea money? Seriously? You really don't know? Everyone pays. The stupider you are, the more you pay. 400K for me. This dumbass donated 20 iMac's to the library. But I got a scholarship. The scholarship is for studying. Don't forget about other maintenance. Receipt: New Student Fee 200,000 baht Divorce Papers What's gotten into you? I was going to sell it to buy a new car. You never play it anymore. I just remembered yesterday was Mum's birthday. Why did you want me to move to this school? Most students from this school get scholarships to study abroad. I wanted to give you better opportunities. I'm not like Mum, you know. Have you ever thought that I might be happier at my old school? Three points. Don't be too loud and disturb the neighbours. Eat dinner. I'm going to bed. Okay, I admit I paid Lynn. But paying her for piano lessons... isn't against any international law, right? Or is it? Will you send me to international court? Have you ever heard that classical music helps with the brain's development? We'll use 4 songs to represent... A, B, C and D. Memorise my finger movements. This is A. Remember it starts with the pinky and finishes with the thumb. This is B. B is 43213, repeated twice. This is C. This one D. I'll give you 3 answers and skip 1. I'll repeat this pattern. So, it won't be suspicious. This'll keep the marks in check, and be under the teacher's radar. Complete the remaining ones yourself. I'll start giving the answers at 9:15 a.m. Meanwhile, complete the remaining questions. D Lynn. This shirt is expensive. Getting rich from teaching piano? You can wear new clothes too, you know. They tease you at school that you're a scrooge. I wouldn't mind a new pair of trousers too. Classical Piano Lessons by Mentor Lynn More people want to join your piano class. Congratulations to Scholarship Students, Academic Year 2013 GRADE 11 Bank Stay tuned for more of Teen Genius. Lynn and I study at the same school. But we're not friends. Actually, we're competitors. What's wrong? Nervous? Umm. Did you have ramen for lunch? How do you know? You've got some on your shirt. Grubby and wrinkled. Here. A baby wipe. For your shirt. Hey! The reward is 5K! We'll actually get less than that. With 3% tax deduction, which is 150. So, it's only 4,850 or 2,425 each. It's still a lot. It's enough for a salmon buffet. If we win, you wanna go this evening? Nah. I don't like eating out. It's a waste of money. What's so funny? Nothing. You sound just like my dad. Is that good or bad? Of course! It's a good thing. Messy hair, wrinkled shirt, exactly like him. What? I just wanna fix your hair. We're gonna be on air soon, gotta look good. Looking dapper now. Ready? Umm. Final question. Tell me Pi's value with as many decimal places as possible. 3.141592653589793... I think that should do it! And the winner of this week's Teen Genius is... Krungthep Thaweepanya School! I'm really awestruck. How did you get Pi's value so quickly? I didn't find it. I just memorised it. You memorised the value of Pi? I used to play memory games with my dad. Pi's value, names of people, and reservoirs. Brilliant. I'm so proud of my scholarship students. Have a seat. I didn't ask you to come, so I could praise you. I have good news for you. Next year, the Singaporean Embassy is offering scholarships. No strings attached. It's a full scholarship. You can study a bachelors and finish with a doctorate. Considering your grades, behaviour and determination, I believe that you two will represent the school well. There's a catch though. The school has been given only one slot. But that shouldn't be a problem, right? Yesterday, you two were teammates. But today rivals. Isn't this fun? Little Bank Laundry Service The machine broke again. I can't finish the laundry in time. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Your hands are all calloused. It's understandable to think that I cheated... but thinking that Bank would cheat too... Aside from my father, Bank is the only other hard-working and most honest person I've ever known. Hey, Bank! What do you want, Tong? Did you study for the exam? Me too, man. I was sick and didn't finish studying. Same here. Then finish studying. Help me! Let me copy you. I really can't fail this time. I've already tried... but this piano code is just too hard for me. What piano code? Oh... not... it's just nothing. Hey, I won't copy for free. I'll pay you. 3,000 baht, enough? My copying won't lower your marks. Wait! Listen to me! Bank! Bank! Damn it, Bank! Can't you help a brother? So damn merciless! Come on. Hurry. Today you're all taking the test together. Don't sit next to your classmates. All right, you may start your test. Class 1 Class 4 Class 3 Class 6 40. This exam paper is set 1. Sir? How do we answer question 40? There are two sets of test papers. Just fill in according to the one you have. A. Set 1 B. Set 2 Be careful. Tong's copying you! Lynn! Which set did you get? So, which set? Set 1. Leave set 1 here. What? Row 3. Banjong. Crew cut with glasses. He's copying Rinrada who's sitting next to him. I'll take a look myself. Don't worry. You can go. What?! You've got 30 minutes left. A. Set 1 Tong. What? Switch papers. Now! Banjong Wongpoom 20 minutes left. Lynn. Lynn. What?! Should I erase your name and write mine instead? No! Just sit still. Another 10 minutes left. Last 5 minutes. B. Set 2 Time's up. Stop writing! Hey! Put your pencils down! That's enough! Don't you have enough A's? That's it! Gosh. The teacher's playing hardball. Mentor Lynn saves the day! Close call. I'm not sure it's worth it. Well, 3,000 for 25 peeps. What do you think? Rinrada! You didn't write your name on the scrap paper. Rinrada, class 11/3 and Banjong class 11/1, please come to the Headmistress's office immediately. I assure you. If you don't believe me, then have Tong retake the test. You'll know the truth. I've called the both of you in... because Thanaphon said there's been some cheating. There are 2 sets of test papers. It's no point to cheat. I'm giving you a chance to tell the truth. Banjong, did you cheat? We'll soon find out. Thanaphon and Rinrada, you're excused. Banjong, you stay here. Lynn, don't leave yet. Why are these problems on your scrap paper? They're not the ones from your set. Please don't get caught. Everything will be okay. The Headmistress probably wants to discuss the scholar... We have evidence that Lynn completed her friend's paper. Lynn. Would you please explain, why? If you don't, then I will expel you. For the money. Tong tried to hire me to do his test. 3,000 baht. I'm very disappointed in you. Vit, I accepted your daughter because... she's an honour student. But getting good grades isn't enough... she also needs to have good behaviour. You're a teacher, you should understand. Completing your friend's exam paper is cheating. It's a violation of school policy. I could expel you right now. However, since this is your first time, I'll just cancel your scholarship. Yes, ma'am. Can't they just retake the exam? Remember Lynn. School is a place for studying, not a place for making money. What's so funny? You're being rude. Nothing. Mr Pravit, you're a teacher, didn't you teach her manners? Sorry. I don't think I'm the only one who uses the school to make extra cash. What do you mean? I'm talking about the 'tea money' that my dad paid. It's not called 'tea money'. It's school maintenance. Isn't school maintenance included in the tuition fee? That's enough, Lynn! I just want her to graduate here. I'll take care of the remaining tuition. Let's go. That's fine. I have one condition. You're banned for the Singapore Scholarship. Okay. Let's go. What's the scholarship have to do with it? It's true that I let my friend copy me, but I've never copied anyone. My grades are from my own work and abilities. Other students also have these abilities. The person who deserves this scholarship more is Thanaphon. If you can't accept this condition, then you can resign. All right, Mr Pravit? Yes, ma'am. Let's go, Lynn. Good luck with the scholarship. Well, if you found evidence... I guess Lynn really did cheat. But I have nothing to do with it. Being an honour student doesn't mean... we have the same behaviour. Ms Rinrada Nilthep Just what I thought. It's not just for 3,000 baht. Piano lessons? Did you ever think that it'd actually be better to teach them? But the Headmistress cheated first. How can you call it cheating? I paid willingly. So did my friends! You still can't see you're wrong?! Fine. I'll take the blame. It's all my fault. I can't blame anyone else. If I can't raise you to be a good person, how dare I go ask other people to pay for your tuition? I'll sell the car to pay the remaining tuition. As for this shirt... I don't want it anymore. About going abroad, just forget it! You're not going anywhere. Stay here with me. Return all the money to your friends. No matter how bad you think of Lynn, but to me... she's truly a good friend. Sorry for being a crybaby, but it's not all an act. GRADE 12 So? Look refreshing? Not bad. Casting is tomorrow. You didn't call just for this, right? How have you been? You can take care of yourselves for the next semesters, right? Pat and I have other things to worry about. Has Pat told you, yet? We just got back from France. The trip was lots of fun. Yeah, 'cause you left me behind. - Well, it was a shopping spree. - Mum. I got you something too. - Pat. - Yes? Go fetch a red wine for me. Why don't you get the help to do it? Yes, sir. Grace, would you like any more dessert? No, thank you. We invited you over today because we would like to thank you. Thank me for what? For helping Pat with his studies. You have no idea... how stressed out we've been over his grades. But ever since Pat's been seeing you, he's like a totally different person. I think you're better than all those famous tutors. We've been planning for some time that we want Pat to study at the same college as I did, at Boston. But with his previous grades... I know he won't make it. So, I've an idea that... you should also go with him. So you can help him study. Sounds good? Don't worry about the expenses. We will take care of it. As for tuition fees... if you need any help... just let me know. No worries. I've some information for you already. Please take a look at it. If money isn't an issue, say yes, all right? You know of the STIC test, right? It's like GAT/PAT, used to apply to American uni's. It's the same paper taken at the same time worldwide. I have to take the STIC... and I need to take it within this year. If not... I won't be able to apply to the uni's in time. I've already risked a lot for you, Grace. I don't feel comfortable asking you... but we really don't know what to do. Pat said he'll pay you 600K baht. Could you return this to Pat? Okay. Could I borrow a pen and some paper? I really can't help you this time. Sorry. Miss. Time zones. The STIC is taken at the same time and date worldwide. So, these countries will take the exam before the rest. Let me break it down. If you two take it in Thailand, while I fly over and take it somewhere earlier. Let's say Sydney, Australia. It's 4 hours ahead of Thailand. I will get to see the exam first. Complete it first. I can send you guys the answers, along with the others in Thailand to as many as we want. Oh my God. You will not only get a passing score, but we will also make money from the others. After deducting the costs, we'll split the profits. Is it too risky? What risk? It's not risky at all. Who is this? Mentor Lynn, babe. This is the only way I can earn enough to go study with you, without asking anyone for money. Oh, I forgot to mention... I'm going to Boston with you guys. It'll be fun if we go together. You two will be responsible for finding clients. For the exam part, I'll take care of it. Wait. Before we go looking for clients, I understand this time zone thing, but I'm still confused how the heck can you get the answers out? Write them down? Memorise them. The best way is to memorise it. It's the safest. There won't be a paper trail. Sorry. Are you one of the X-Men? The STIC has over 100 questions. How are you gonna remember all that? I can do it. If there's enough time. The problem is after I finish the test... there's not much time left. The most I can remember now is half of it. Only half? There's one person who could help. But he wouldn't. What's up, Mum? Yeah, I'm done. Ms Rut's house? Can't it be another day? Tomorrow... I have the scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m. Okay. Hey, you! Your basket grazed by mirror! If you said sorry... 250K for a passing score... little money for you, right? The tutorial fee for STIC is way more expensive. We'll need approximately 30 clients. If more than this, it will be risky. Anything less won't be worth it. I've got almost 30 people in my STIC group chat. If you get them to join, you'll get 5,000 baht discount per head, deducted from your full payment. Wait a minute. You must make sure no one else knows about this. Especially, that loser Bank. Don't mind that dumbass. He won't say anything. Why? Didn't you hear? That dumbass got beaten up. He's now in hospital. The best part is... he didn't make it to the scholarship exam. Seminar: To Excel in Education - 2B COME WON I believe that everyone here wants to pass the STIC for your brighter future. He's Steve Pat. I have a way for us all to get satisfactory scores. The only things you're allowed in the exam room is a 2B pencil, eraser, exam ID, and passport. Communication devices aren't definitely allowed. So, I'll hide the phone used to send the answers back to you inside a toilet tank in the washroom. I'll send the answers back in between breaks. The exam is split into 3 parts, with 2 breaks. Wait. Just a sec. How will the clients bring all the answers to the exam? Not everyone is capable like you. Barcode. Everyone will receive 2B pencils with a barcode stuck on it. The different widths of the barcode will represent the answer choices. Starting from the left to right. The thickest is A, then B, C, and D. Sounds cool, huh? But the fun doesn't end here. There are 4 pencils. One pencil for one section. The numbers next to the barcode are for grid-in questions. For the essay part, they usually use published articles. I'll send you the key words to Google it. Hey, it's mine. It fell. Hey, pay attention! You will have to write the essay yourself. In short, on the exam day, everyone will leave the meeting point before 7.30 a.m. to arrive at the exam centres on time. We will provide motortaxis for you to take you to the exam centres. Finally... everyone will have to pay in cash within 2 weeks. Otherwise, the deal will be cancelled. I'd also like to emphasise that what we are doing is confidential. Any problems? If there aren't... I will end the seminar now. We will unite together to excel in education. We'll get the scores we need to get in all the universities. We will choose the university. They don't get to choose us! Whoa. That's rough, Little Bank. What's up? Sorry to hear that... you missed out on the scholarship. Same here. That day... I really didn't mean to. I wouldn't know if you meant it or not. What I do know is that... you're responsible for what happened. I have a proposition for you. What's it? Taking an exam. Take or cheat an exam? To me the word cheat means that one person loses something. But we will get money, and the others will get good scores. Win-win. Bank. We both are losers, you know. We're not born winners like Grace and Pat. We must try harder to get what's ours. Look, what happened? It's not the same. You cheated. I was just unlucky. True. But don't you see even if you don't cheat... life cheats you anyways. This is Grace's address. See you tomorrow if you're interested. Sit here. Aren't you gonna sit? This is what's gonna happen... first... we'll fly to Sydney and take the STIC together. Hey, Lynn. You're missing a document. Dad. You remember that programme, Teen Genius? They want me to compete in Sydney. They need your bank statement for visa purposes. Who are you going with? With Bank. Huh? It's not just the two of us, there's a teacher too. Second... You and I... will have to memorise the answers, half each. Don't forget... Bank memorises the first half, and Lynn the second half. Section 1 has 52 questions. Start! SECTION 1: 52 QUESTIONS SECTION 3: 16 GRID-IN QUESTIONS For the last section, you need to leave early to send the essay question. Time's up for section 4. Start the essay. Memorising the key words shouldn't be difficult for you. But the hard part is they won't let you leave early. To avoid any suspicion... you have to act sick. Sure. I can throw up. I have to puke now? No! How much is my cut? 1 million. How much is yours? 2 million. What do you say, Bank? Everything is in your hands. Okay. Got it! - In time. - Yes! You should've just said yes from the start. Such a poser. Hey, guys! See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Have you lost it? The flight's at 11:00 p.m. What's the rush? There is one more thing we need to rehearse. That's enough. You just can't keep on grilling the innocent! You must be enjoying... seeing the innocent cry like this. That's too much, Pat. Way too much. I've used up all my cards. You guys act as if we really got caught. I told you I understand... if you get caught, we'll blame only you. Last question before heading to the airport. Last question. In character. Ready? What if Bank gets caught? What will you say? That's even more far-fetched. I'm not even friends with him. I've seen him around school for 4-5 years. I've never seen him with friends. He looks like a douchebag. Weirdo. He even got beaten up and ended up in a landfill. Are we finished? Stop! Stop it, Bank! Stop! I told you to stop! Dumbass! Get off him! What the hell is wrong with you? You're the one who told me to say this. So, why are you mad at me? Pat, stop. Bank... Bank, enough. Why? - Why? - I... - You... what?! - never... told anyone that I woke up in a landfill! Now you know what I'm mad about! You all set this up, right? You guys set me up so I couldn't get the scholarship. All of you were in it, right? You guys knew, right? Right? You knew, right? Why aren't you answering? Bank... wait. Calm down, Bank. I don't freaking want to hear from you again! Bank, wait! Let's talk! Calm down. Calm down. You okay? I'm sorry, Bank. I'm sorry. I didn't think they'd be so rough on you. Bank, hear me out. You'll still take the STIC, right? Forget the damn STIC! Bank... Bank, listen to me. You, listen to me! It's just me and my mum. She's like a hunchback, doing laundry. You... I'm not rich like you. The scholarship was my dream. My dream for my mum to be comfortable. So, damn you! Bank, if I don't pass the STIC, my dad will kill me. Please, Bank. Please. Win-win, for us both. Please, Bank. Then... send those thugs to beat up your dad! What the hell is wrong with you?! Weren't you the one who told me you needed him? If I didn't play dirty, do you think he'd help? Lynn. Let's talk first. Were you in on this? No, I had no clue. Please try to understand Pat. He did it because... he wanted to help with your plan. Without considering who would get hurt?! The Future of Laundry Grace, return everyone's money. I'm pulling out. Wait, Lynn. Calm down. Okay. I respect your decision. It's okay. No more clients, okay? Just the 3 of us. The original plan. Don't you understand? When I said no, I meant no. Fine. Up to you then. I just have one request. Don't be mad at me. If I had half your brains, I wouldn't do something this stupid. Please. The flight will leave in 3 hours. Let's go. Bank. I'll go through with it. At least there's money in it. I won't get beaten up for free. What if I told you that... I don't wanna do it anymore. I'm not asking you. The reason why I'm here is because of you. You're why I ended up in that landfill. All of this shit is because of you. Don't you feel responsible for what you started? SYDNEY Here's your phone. Lynn. Huh? I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Well... your nose. Okay. You know... I've never been abroad before. From tomorrow onwards, the world is our oyster. Let's take a selfie. FINAL TEST Classical Music for Studying The first break is from 5:15- 5:25 a.m. We're ready. Bank? I want another million. 1 more million? You ass! Screw you! Damn you! Pat! What's wrong? Damn! Transfer the money in 5 min or forget about the answers. Damn it! What 5 minutes?! Ask him! What the hell is wrong with him?! Calm down. Keep your cool. I can't keep cool! Bank, you bastard! This's Grace. I thought we already agreed. 1 million for my fee and another for getting beaten up. This is all I've got. You'll get more when I get the answers. Okay. A, B, B, C, C, A C, A, B, C, D, B B, A, C, B, C, D Fair game. Back in the game. Next, Grid-in answers. For Sale Don't we need to leave before 7:30 a.m.? Yeah! It's 7 a.m. Where's the rest of the answers?! I don't know! Good morning. Is Lynn here? I can't get in touch with her. I haven't seen her. She told me she went to Sydney for a competition. Oh yeah. No wonder I haven't seen her. I'm sure she'll bring back a medal. But I found this permission letter at home. I called, but no one answered. So, I came to this address. Someone tell me why Lynn's in Sydney? If you don't answer, I'll go to the Headmistress. Tell me now what are you up to! Lynn and Bank are a couple! They went on a secret trip. Lynn was afraid you wouldn't let her go. So, she lied. I really didn't know how to stop her. It's best you talk to your daughter, sir. Fine. C'mon! Sir. Love is a beautiful thing. What's up? It's 7 a.m. already. The motortaxis are leaving. It's a lot later than agreed. Tell me what's wrong. I don't know a damn thing! I'll talk to them. What's with your leg? - It's almost 7:30. - What are we waiting for? - Where are the barcodes? - I've already paid. It'll be okay. You'll get there in time. I promise. Pat! We've run out of stickers. Here you go. 500 each. Chill. We'll leave soon. Shit! Hey! Can you please open the door?! It's almost 7:30, Grace! We have all the answers?! No! Another 6. Why's it say EDGE? Huh? It says EDGE! What's EDGE?! There's no reception. What happens if we don't make it? And the money we paid? We won't make it! We want our refund! C'mon. Did you get it, yet? C B C D These 3 go to the Bangkapi exam centre. These 2 rows to Suttisarn. Did you get on, yet? Don't forget your helmet! Pass it on. One set per person! We're ready! Hurry up! Wear your helmet! Let's go! I'm from the embassy. A Thai student confessed using his phone's dictionary. We're resolving the situation. What will happen to him? They'll probably cancel his scores. Worst case, he'll be banned from the STIC for good. They'll question you. If there isn't anything else, you may leave. Just wait here. I'm going to talk to them. Hold on. Is there something? Huh? May I use the toilet? Of course. Lynn. Mentor Lynn's FC. Thanks so much, Lynn. We're throwing a party at my place tonight. For what? Did you know Bank got caught? And my scores were cancelled. Well... we'll look for another exam centre for you. If you don't retake the exam, you won't be able to apply to the uni in time. Hey, Lynn. You have to retake the exam. Please Lynn, pretty please? I've changed my mind. You've already got the scores you needed. But... we can't go without you. Don't you both know... that uni exams aren't multiple choices? Even if I went with you... you wouldn't be able to copy me. I'll find my own ride. Where's your boyfriend? Where's he? I wanted to invite him for dinner. So? Why didn't you tell me about him? Dad... Yes? I have a confession. What is it, honey? Tell me. Why do you choose to study Education? I'd like to be a teacher like my father. So, others can benefit the most from my knowledge. Do you have experience in tutoring, or teaching anyone? Yes, I do. I scored 1,460 on STIC Being a teacher isn't just about academics. Do you think... you can set a good example in other ways? Lynn. Are you coming? Bank's taken his share. Come get yours. Miss you. I'm not going to lie. I've done a lot a bad things in the past. But I will use them to teach myself and others. Lynn left the chat. What a waste. You've achieved so much. You can apply to scholarships and study abroad. Aren't you interested in any of them? I think... someone else deserves it more. Student Expulsion Letter: Thanaphon Viriyakul Bank: Come over to my place tonight. Come in. The store looks fresh, Little Bank. Oops, it's Mister Bank now. You laundering money? You were expelled from school because... the embassy reported you, right? Yeah. What's next? That's the reason why I asked you over. Did you apply for the GAT/PAT exams? I have a proposition for you. I have a fool-proof plan. Much safer. We can get the answers out to more people. More importantly, there're more GAT/PAT clients than STIC. But this plan... won't be complete without Mentor Lynn. How much more money do you need? If your cut isn't enough... you can get mine from Pat. Go collect it. No. Wait. It's not about the money. It's about... from now on... how much more we can make. Lynn. I've done the calculations. This round... there's at least 10 million in it. Don't you think it's worth the risk again? You've seen it. If we get caught, we wouldn't go to jail. Lynn. Are you gonna study 4 years for a 5 figure salary? You can earn millions, starting today. Why work at a stupid desk job? Because for me... no amount of money is worth it. Lynn. If you won't do this... I'll tell everyone you're the mastermind of the STIC scandal. I guarantee. You'll be banned from studying abroad like me. Fine. We are even then. It won't just be you! Grace, Pat, and all the clients who took the STIC too. Think about it... if the board finds out, they'll cancel all the scores in Thailand. One last thing... your dad will be so disappointed in you. Don't be afraid, honey. We'll get through this, no matter what. Smile. Smile like me. You once told me... if we win, we'll win together. If we lose, then we'll all lose together. I won't be the only one taking all the blame. If you won't do it, I'll make sure you go down with me! What do you say, Lynn? What's it going to be? Everything is up to you now. You're right. Everything is up to me.
