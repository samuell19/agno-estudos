How marvelous... Every time I return to this island I find it more beautiful and wild. - Don't you agree? - We all agree, Dad. You just say the same thing every year. Don't upset the old man. You should know that it'll make him feel bad. - Michele? - Yes, auntie? Don't forget to bring my rifles when we disembark. Yes, sure, but would you tell me why you'll need them? I intent on going hunting. But that's absurd, my dear aunt! There aren't any birds on this island. How idiotic to come here just to get bored on four rocks. If you didn't feel like it, why did you come? Don't talk rubbish. You know that they forced me to. But you should admit that you will miss your lovers. My dear, why don't you think about all the times you betrayed your husband? - Where are we mooring? - The small harbour by the villa. But isn't that dangerous? Relax. The sea bed is about 6 meters down. The boat is safe. My voices told me we should have delayed the departure. They warned me, my voices: "Don't go, Patrizia. Don't go!" - There goes the witch again... - Blood... blood... I see blood everywhere. I can feel that something terrible will happen soon! The icy cold touch of death will freeze your hearts. And your souls will vanish down there, in the dark of the night! Don't get worked up. It's better if you go down and rest. You don't believe me, but you'll regret it! Your sister is completely insane. Try to be more sensitive. You're my wife, after all. I wish you'd remember that more often. Or am I asking too much? If you won't throw your usual tantrum, I'd like to ask you a question. What is it? - Your father is now old and demented. - Cut it out. For how much longer do we have to obey him and do whatever he wants? For the last time: I'm not discussing this. Don't raise your voice and calm down. And about your father... Either we move far away from him, or we better get a divorce. You know I hate him, and you should do the same. But being the hypocrite you are, you'll never admit it. - That's enough now. - Yes, sure. But let me say at least that it's his fault if you're like that. - And what do you think I am? - An abulic being. With no self-control and spineless. But it's always been useful for you to have a husband like me. Not true. You know that I always wanted you to be different. Bullshit. Nothing but bullshit. The reality is different. - You're only interested in my money. - Now you're being vulgar. I did everything I could to make you a real man. It's not my fault that it didn't work. That doesn't authorize you to shower me with ridicule all the time. Remember: You'll only be a real man the day your father dies. Don't count on it because you'll regret it... ...and that day will really be the end for you! Why don't you get ready? I propose going to the beach for a swim. No, I need to finish unpacking. I'll be there later. What is this gun doing in your suitcase? I always carry it with me since those kids mugged me. I'm scared. - But there aren't any muggers on the island. - You're right. There are only gentlemen on this island. And, as usual, they enjoy themselves by tearing each other to shreds. What's wrong, Carla? Full of sarcasm today? No, I just like to say whatever I'm thinking. In any case, at least while we're on this island... ...there is no need for this weapon. Did you notice that there's a lot of tension between Michele and Lorenzo? They've always hated each other, ever since they were kids. I think they hate me too, and I'm their father. I don't think it was a good idea... ...to have them stay under the same roof. Why not? After all, they're brothers. Yes, like Cain and Abel. - Now, where is it? - Come on, Julia, let's go. - What are you looking for? - The mouth-piece for the respirator. - I'm sure I brought it. - It's probably in someone else's room. - You'll find it later. - You go on ahead. See you soon. Patrizia, what are you doing there? You're still not ready? Do you hear it? - Hear what? - The seagulls. But there haven't been any on this island for years. Where do you see them? Where? Where? I don't see them, but I hear them. Do you know why their cry sounds like a lament? They're the souls of all the seafarers... - ...lost at sea. - What a joyful topic... Come on. Come on, Patrizia. Let's go. How can we be happy, jolly, relaxed on this island... ...when you can breathe death in the air? Stop it. You're exaggerating. I'm not coming, I've got a headache. This is your headache. This! Be careful, Michele. Your father is watching us. It's better to be cautious. I wouldn't want him to get upset and ruin our holiday. Apart from the money, you married him because he isn't jealous, right? Jealous, no. But capable of killing, yes. Here comes your wife. You know why she lets you cheat on her? - Because she's frigid. - You're right. Aside from being frigid, she's also stupid. Then tell me why you married her. I don't know. Perhaps out of curiosity. Or perhaps because of the dowry. I need a drink. Why don't you go to the villa? There's a full bar waiting for you. - Yes, great idea. Coming with me? - Sure, let's go. Look at Greta, she's trying to seduce her brother-in-law. - And Lorenzo lets her. - Oh, my brother's so good. He's used to it by now. Wait! Don't run! I'll get you! - Want a drink? - No, thanks. - It's so hot. - Shall we go back to the beach? Wait. What's gotten into you? We have to spend two weeks on this island... - Surprised? - No. They say you're a real man. Is that true? What's wrong? Scared of a scandal, perhaps? No, no. You never change. I don't see why I should change. Making love is the only thing that pleases me. Only that makes me feel like a woman. I don't see why I should give it up. Let's go back. It's late. Not yet. Please... Please, let's stay here. Here it is. That's the one. Death. This card has been haunting me all night. It's a nightmare. You're a sadist. You always talk about death. Patrizia is a psychic. A real fortune-teller. She always manages to foresee the future. Right now, all she manages to do is scare the hell out of me. Carla. There. You have no way out. - Take it, it's for you. - No, thanks. You know I don't drink. You could make an exception for one evening. Please don't insist. No alcohol, no cigarettes and no women. What are you laughing about? We're pointing out your husband's abstinence. There's nothing funny about it. It seems like a rather unpleasant subject. That's why you satisfy your desires outside the home, my dear. Well? What's gotten into you now? - He's been nervous for a while. - No, not that! You're not to talk! You know that you let other people sleep with your wife! Idiot! Don't be so touchy, dad. No one here gives a damn about it. Forgive us, Lorenzo. Sometimes, sarcasm at any cost can be in bad taste. Please tell your husband that he's a huge cuckold. What did he say that was so bad? Everyone knows you didn't step out of a convent when you got married. But I changed after the wedding, and you know that very well. Yes, it's true. Now you're not getting paid anymore... ...now you do it for free. You know that proverb? "Once a whore, always a whore." And you certainly are still a whore. What are you doing? I prepared you some powdered milk. Take it. It's the usual dose of sleeping pills. But it tastes strange tonight. Where would I find fresh milk on this island? Aren't you going to bed? No, I'm not tired. - Where are you going? - Downstairs, to the lounge. I want to listen to some music. - Are you happy I came? - Yes. Get undressed. - Why are you so late? - Your father is still up. He's reading, and might be waiting for me. Don't worry about it. Yes, it's better that way. Dimmed lights... That's it. It's not enough... Like that. We can't go on like this. - Is there another way? - Yes, eliminate the obstacle. There are two obstacles: Your husband and my wife. Carla doesn't count, your father is the real problem. Right. We'll talk about it later. - Greta, don't go. - What's wrong? I know that Walter is waiting for you. Don't go. - If Walter or somebody else doesn't matter. - Now you're exaggerating. Don't make me lose my patience, Greta. You'd better stay here. - Don't be ridiculous, Lorenzo. - I'm ordering you. I don't take orders from anyone. Finally. - I couldn't come earlier. - Greta... What is it? Are you nervous? My husband had an attack of jealousy. - That hasn't happened in years. - I actually understand him. It must be the atmosphere on this island. - You look sad. - No, no, strange things are happening. Don't believe what Patrizia says. She always sees blood everywhere. My wife is just an alcoholic. I have a feeling that the one behind all this strange anxiety... - ...is Julia. - What does Julia have to do with it? She only married the old man to get to his inheritance... ...and that's normal. However, she sleeps with Michele even though she doesn't love him... ...and that's abnormal. You mean she only does it to get closer to her goal? Apart from being beautiful, dear, you're also intelligent... - ...and that surprises me. - Come here. Look. It wasn't moving earlier. Someone must have watched us. Maybe my husband! - The light! - Yes... I'm scared, Walter. I'm scared! Calm down. Calm down! Don't get excited. Don't get excited. Calm down. No! No! Don't push me! It's too high! I'm scared! No! - Come on, already! Move! Move! - Wait a moment. Come on! Come on! - Come on! You're so slow! - Wait for me! Come on! Yes, like that. Good! Good! You're doing good! Come on! Come on! Come on! Swim! Where's Julia? I don't know. Tell your brother he's making me sick. I want him to take better care of his wife. Come on! A little more. We made it. You made me swallow some water. Come up. Help! Michele! It's Carla. What's wrong with her? - Help! - It's just one of Carla's usual jokes. But I think that something's really wrong. Michele, your wife is in trouble. Don't worry. It's a stupid joke. But she screamed as if she was really drowning. Idiots! What are you waiting for? Help her. I'll go this way. Go further out. Closer to the rocks! Yes, you're there. Lorenzo, you search there. Stay where you are! She might be there! Check the other side. Go! Nothing! Let's go behind the rocks. I don't see anything! Damn it... There's nothing we can do. Call Michele, and let's tell the others. No... - We'll go looking for her with the boat. - No, it's too late. We have to inform the police on the mainland. - But how? - The radio. Let's go to the yacht. But... where's the yacht? Perhaps the sailors put to the sea to unload the waste. - Maybe they're drunk. - Imbeciles! Imbeciles! - Let's take the boat and go look for them. - Yes. Untie it. - What is it? - I don't know. The spark plugs...! The spark plugs are gone. They were still here this morning. I went fishing. - We don't have any spares. - Someone must have taken them. Yes, you're right. There's something strange about this. First the yacht disappears, then the boat is rendered useless. Something else doesn't convince me: Carla's disappearance. - Or her death. - But then we're prisoners! - We can't leave the island! - This cursed island! Cursed! I want to leave. Leave! Cover the motor. - Julia, leave me alone this evening. - Come on, don't be nervous. - Carla's death has shaken me. - I understand you... ...but what can you do? She was my wife. You remember that only now? - Very convenient, huh? - Forgive me. I didn't mean to offend you. It's just that my nerves are frayed. - It's not important. - Do you want a drink? Yes, thanks. A whiskey. Without ice. Yes. Julia, where were you when the accident happened? Why are you asking? They suspect that someone pulled Carla underwater. Speak clearly. What are you implying? Lorenzo pointed out that you weren't there today. But that's absurd! It's a vulgar insinuation. You know that Carla was paranoid. How many times has she pretended to commit suicide? She just went too far today, that's all. Sure... She went too far. And who knows? She jumped on the yacht and took off. And now she's enjoying herself, knowing we're all scared. Sure. Your wife is enjoying herself... ...with the sailors. I dreamed about Charlie's death. It was a bad dream. A terrifying dream. Water... Some water, please. It was a mistake, a big mistake. We shouldn't have brought her with us. I've been insisting for years... ...that she needs to be hospitalized and get a long sleep therapy. And who is this Charlie? Why does she always dream about him? I'll explain it to you. He was a local sailor. He disappeared one night during a storm. And no one has seen him ever since. When did it happen? I think... - ...20 years ago. - It's very strange. It happened so long ago, but she still remembers. I'm asking myself why... Who knows? It's some kind of obsession. Charlie... It was a terrible shock for her. It's you! Yes... In my dream... I saw the men who killed him. Enough! That's enough! - Don't mention him again. - One moment... Why does she still talk about murder? - Because she's a poor old lunatic! - No! I'm not crazy! They killed him, yes! They killed him! And you know it! The lights again... Perhaps there's a defect. - No, it happened last night as well. - Switch on a lamp. Stop! There's someone there. It's just Lorenzo. Idiot, couldn't you have warned us? You enjoyed it, huh? Yes, in my dream, I also saw the faces of the murderers! Yes, Elisabetta talks nonsense. We have to give her something to calm her down. I'll take care of it. I have a sedative in my room. I'll go and get it. Julia! Julia, what happened? Tell me. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do. He had heart problems. - Above all, his wife was too young... - You're a coward. A filthy, dirty coward. Take me away from here, Michele. - I can't take it anymore! - Stop it. He always drank a glass of milk before he went to bed... - ...with a sleeping pill. - A very dangerous habit. - Especially if the dose isn't right. - Are you implying I poisoned your father? You're a bastard! Now we have a wealthy widow in the family. No, you're wrong. I'm not the only heir here. There's you, Michele, and Patrizia and Walter. He's the son-in-law, and has a right to get a share of the inheritance. Do you want to know something? You are right. There are four of us. It's not for certain that all four heirs will see the sun rise in the morning. You won't believe it... ...but I'm telling you... ...that the dead come back. An unburied soul can take over the body... ...of a living being while it sleeps. And force it to do whatever it wants. It's absolutely clear in my mind. I see it. Our father... ...was murdered by one of us in a state of trance. By order of the cursed ghost that inhabits this island. There are no other explanations. Maybe she's right. Julia was in the room with her husband. She would've noticed if someone came in to kill him, don't you think? That's where you're wrong. Julia wasn't with her husband. She was with me in my room. Cut it out! Come and take a look. It's aunt Elisabetta. She seems agitated. Who says she didn't poison him? Nobody hated him as much... as she did. We were all in her room last night. Yes, but it might just be an alibi. Elisabetta only screamed to get our attention... ...but she had already put the poison in the milk. So you think she killed him 20 years later to avenge her dear Charlie? Perhaps. In that case we'll be the next victims. We were there when Charlie was killed. Let's follow her. Maybe we'll finally get to the truth. Come on. - There she is. There, on that rock. - Let's go. She's down there. You again? Go away! I don't want to see you. Why did you follow me? What do you want from me? - Leave a poor lunatic alone! - What are you doing here all alone? There! There... should be a bloody corpse! - And how do you know that? - I saw it in my dream. And who was this bloody corpse? - One of us? - The dream was confused. It was a woman's body. As you can see, your dream has deceived you. It's here... Here it is! It's here...! Right in front of me. I see it. It's completely covered in blood. The eyes are wide open. Come and see. It's here... Please take it away! I'm begging you! Close those eyes! Oh, my God! They killed her. No, Walter, it might have been an accident. An accident? You call this an accident? It was a crime! This is the work of a lunatic! Your father dies. So does Carla. Now your sister died! Who are the heirs? You, your brother and Julia! If the killer is a lunatic... ...he's a very cunning lunatic. Charlie... Look, Charlie! He's up there! His clothes are still covered in blood, but he's alive! Alive! He must have come for me. For me! Didn't you see him? He's up there. He came back to take revenge. Drink it all. It will help you rest. There... It was so horrible. Do you think so too? That it was an accident. No. The same goes for Carla. - Nobody wanted to believe it was a crime. - It could also have been... suicide. Patrizia wasn't the suicidal type. If you ask me, she was murdered. And aunt Elisabetta knows something. I'm sure her ghost of Charlie isn't just a fantasy. Do you know the real story? Yes, my husband told me something. Charlie was aunt Elisabetta's lover. All four of them were there when he was killed: Uberto, Lorenzo, Michele and Walter. - They did it. - I don't know for sure... ...but I think so. It's a family of madmen. Even the sanest of them still has a grain of insanity in them. Rich, powerful and sadistic. They consider themselves above the law. Whatever infamous deeds they commit, they're convinced... ...that they'll never have to pay for them. Do you know why they punished that poor Charlie? It wasn't for seducing Elisabetta... ...but because he had one big flaw they couldn't accept: He was poor. That's why I don't think Patrizia and Carla committed suicide. - And all that happened 20 years ago? - About 20 years ago. Even if I accept that what you say is true... ...why did Elisabetta wait so long to take her revenge? There's only one explanation: Even though it's not so obvious at first glance, Elisabetta is mentally ill as well. She'd be happy to see us suffer... ...and to die, one by one. Slowly. Nothing. Not a trace of the yacht. Then the sailors weren't drunk. Someone must have sent them away. - Or they were killed. - What are you trying to say? Forget about ghosts... ...we only need to worry about a bloodthirsty madman. It will be our turn soon. Yes, but three deaths in two days can't be caused by madness. And why not? Perhaps three isn't so many. Do you want a simple hypothesis? First, Julia drowned Carla... ...then she poisoned her husband. With your approval. - You're a bastard! - Forget it. Go on. Don't get angry, it's just an assumption. Think about it, what is Julia after, huh? The inheritance. And now she's a little closer. Why don't you make another assumption? Aunt Elisabetta... it could've been her or an accomplice. If Elisabetta has an accomplice on this island... - ...it could only be Charlie. - Charlie is dead. - Nobody knows this better than us. - No, wait... Walter wanted to say something else: Who says that Charlie really is dead? In fact, he was still alive, if I'm not mistaken. - Do you remember? - Yes, he was still alive when we buried him. There's only one way to be sure: We have to dig him up. Now they're trembling as well, these supermen. He was a poor sailor, but he's making them die of fright. I just hope I'm not involved in this dirty little story. - Are you sure this was the place? - Yes, I'm sure. I'm really starting to think that Charlie isn't dead. That together with aunt Elisabetta, he's decided to kill every last one of us. We're wasting time here. There is no body. Either aunt Elisabetta tells us the truth... ...or we have to find Charlie before he kills us... if he's alive. Greta, what is it? Calm down, Greta! Calm down! Unbelievable... These are the same sailor's clothes Charlie was wearing when he died. Dead people don't walk around committing crimes. - Put it away. Get rid of it. - Take care of it. Michele, some cognac. Aunt Elisabetta hid him in there. Don't you think so too? She takes pleasure in sensing our fear growing. But who would benefit from these murders? - Michele! I was so scared. - Julia! We found him on the beach. - Burnt to death. - No! Julia! Julia! Some water, quick. Julia... Come on. Be strong. Drink. - Where's Greta? - She was tired. - She might have gone to bed. - You shouldn't have left her alone. Greta? Greta? - She's sleeping. - Wake her up. It's better to stay together this night. Greta. Wake up. Greta! What shall we do? Leave her here? No, we better take her outside. It was him. Yes, I saw him. - It was him... - Who? Charlie. It really was him. Charlie. He was out there, silent... ...not moving. I'm sure it was him. Don't you believe me? See for yourselves. Are you convinced now? Charlie will be here soon. And you two will pay for your dreadful crime with your life. It's pointless! You can't stop him with a simple rifle. No! No! You won't be able to kill my Charlie! Not for a second time! - Michele! What is all this smoke? - I don't know. I saw someone. I shot at him, but it didn't do anything. There! Behind that curtain! Just like a ghost! Not so happy anymore? Your end is nigh! Enough! Enough! Don't make me lose my nerves! - I'd be capable of anything! - Quiet! You watch over Julia! I'll take a look outside! Julia? No! What do you want? What does this mean? Why? Because sooner or later everyone has to settle their score. That monster out there is your daughter, isn't that true? From your relationship with your beloved Charlie... ...you were left pregnant. Or am I mistaken? You went all alone on a long trip around the world... ...and so your daughter was born far away from everyone. Now the cub is all grown up and your little secret has become a tiger. Yes, she's my daughter. Kill me... but don't hurt her. It would be too easy. No! She's the only real thing I have left. It's all my fault. No! She's all I have in the world! These are real bullets. Not blanks like the ones you put in Michele's rifle... ...when he shot at the ghost. Watch out! He loaded the rifle with real bullets. He could kill you. How did you figure it out? It could only be you. You're the only one whose body was never found. It's true. On that day, I pretended to drown. In reality, I disappeared underwater and swam away. From a distance, I saw you all scared. It was the first happy moment in my life. The first sweet taste of revenge. - What are you going to do now? - How could you keep it secret for so long? It's a long story. Tell it to me. We've got all night ahead of us. - Where are the spark plugs? - You knew who it was. You knew that Carla was doing the killing. And knowing all the risks you never did anything to stop her. Why? The satisfaction of seeing my relatives killed was worth any risk. Where are the spark plugs? If you think we'll obey you peacefully, you're mistaken. This is the last warning. I hid them behind a rock, in a hole. No! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! No...! - Let go of me! Damn it! - No! No! No! No!
