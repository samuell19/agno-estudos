Hi, I'm Belle. I'd like to add this sub to my third contention but I'm worried about time. You can chart it on your flow and make the call when you're up there. Oh my god. One o'clock. I think he's on the other team. I will gladly argue the negative on that case. First, he has zero nerd cred. Secondly, he's imminently do-able. If I'm wondering what he looks like naked, which I am, then there's no way he's on the team. [ whispering ] You have a boyfriend. I'm just saying. Next we have a Lincoln-Douglas style debate on whether it is morally permissible for a victim to use deadly force as a deliberate response to repeated domestic violence. Speaking for the affirmative from Ferndale Prep, Miss Miriam Weeks. Miriam? Make it rain, girl. [ applause ] I affirm the resolution that it is morally permissible for victims to use deadly force as a deliberate response to repeated domestic violence. I define "moral" as pertaining to, or concerned with, the principles of right and wrong. "Permissible" as permitted or allowable. A "victim" as a person who suffers from a destructive or injurious action or agency. My value for this debate is justice. Plato defines "justice" as doing well to one's friend if he's good and harming one's enemy if he is evil. [ Ralph ]: Miriam, can you come in here? You got something in the mail today. It's from uh, Duke University. You ever heard of that place? Oh, honey. Just give it to her. Let me see it. Aah. Oh my gosh, this is it. It's a big envelope. Is that good? Only one way to find out. I got in! Yes! [ squealing ] Bring it in. See? I told you. When you put your studies first and you're willing to work hard- [ simultaneous ] Good things happen. What kind of financial aid package did they offer? That part of the offer appears to be a little underwhelming. It's Duke though. But Vanderbilt offered you a full ride. It's just as good a school. But Duke is my dream school, and it's number one for pre-law. It's your decision. If Duke is what you have your heart set on then we'll figure out a way to make the finances work. Thank you, daddy! To the graduates. Here, here. [ Mom ]: To Miriam and Josh. So, big day little sis. Do you feel any different now that it's official? Mmm, not really. I'm just relieved, mostly. All the hard work paid off. [ Mom ]: And now you can't be mad about having a strict curfew. [ Miriam ]: I can still be a little mad. Uh, wait. Let's say grace. Lord, thank you for these gifts which we are about to receive through the bounty of Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hey. What's going on? You're being really weird. No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. I just don't need you hanging on me every second, ok? Look. I'm sorry. But I feel like I need to be honest. We're gonna be 3,000 miles away from each other next year and I- No- I don't think that it's such a good idea if either of us are tied down. You know I'm crazy about you. But it just makes sense. I want to have fun, and I want you to have fun. You're gonna go to Duke and you're gonna meet guys and you're gonna wanna go on dates and party- No, don't tell me what I want.

For the purposes of my article I can use an alias. Whatever you're comfortable with. And I promise to be fair. I just don't know. This is your chance to tell your side. Don't you want to make lemonade? You know, the guy who outed me was watching hardcore porn and yet I'm the one who's being called a slut. Because somehow creating the content is more shameful than consuming it? It's a double standard. So doing porn, for you, is a feminist act? Yeah, in a way. Is that why you're doing it? I'm doing it because I need money. My parents can't afford the $60,000 a year tuition at Duke and I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life. I mean, if I waitressed part-time I would maybe make $400 a month, and it's degrading. You don't find porn degrading? Actually, it's empowering. I get to have this alter-ego. It's like Miriam is this serious, studious, nerdy girl and then Belle is this sexy, mischievous, uninhibited minx. Yeah, but... aren't most of the directors men? And then the way that these women are shown, usually helpless, disposable sex toys that exist only to pleasure men. It's true, a lot of the directors are men. But maybe it's time that that changed. And there's a lot of different kinds of porn for different sexual preferences. You know, a lot of women, myself included, are really turned on by BDSM and sexual domination. My sexual preference doesn't make me any less feminist. They're all looking at me. You think they know? Yeah. They're laughing. It's like I'm wearing a scarlet letter or something. So what do your parents think? Oh, no. They can't find out. They're really Catholic and really conservative and I know that they would just freak out. I mean, my mom would probably disown me. They still think I'm a virgin. I have to get to class. Ok. Thanks for talking with me. No, thank you. I'm really looking forward to your article. Slut. Thank you for being here for me. It really means a lot. I don't have anyone else to talk to. Girl, I got you. Everything's gonna be ok. You can't let a few a-holes get to you. Hi ladies. What brings you to the women's centre today? Last week somebody put this sign on my door. This morning I got a death threat on my Facebook account. The messages I get are awful. That I should kill myself, I should get expelled.

We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to this type of harassment- And it's not just one person, either. Would you like me to speak to the resident's advisor? We could see about moving your room? Maybe to a non-co-ed building. No, I love being Jolie's roommate. Ok, well that is an option if you change your mind. So there's no way I'll get kicked out of school, right? No, no. Absolutely not. Just so you know, our perspective is that what you do in your own time and how you choose to make a living, as long as it's legal, is entirely your choice. We do not pass judgment here. I really hope you come forward with a complaint and we can figure this out together. Well, I'm not ready to do that. At least not yet. Thank you so much. You've been super helpful. Yeah, I actually feel a little better. Good, I'm glad. I really think you should reach out to your family. It can be difficult being isolated and if you're feeling bullied it's incredibly important you have a strong support network. The stress of trying to keep a secret can often be worse than coming clean. Thanks ladies. You guys? The article got published. Amanda totally lied. She said she'd be fair. She gave you an alias like she said she would. "Missy makes a compelling argument. "I'm a feminist and to me that means taking agency "over my personal liberty and my right to choose "what to do with my body." This is really flattering. I don't understand why you're so upset. She makes me sound like I contradict myself. Then she says I'm insecure and that makes me sound like I'm some first-year woman seeking approval or something. She said to make lemonade. I don't know. I thought she made you sound pretty good. Well, I'm not some insecure, first-year woman. She reduced me to a cliché. I think she made you seem really human. And vulnerable. I don't want pity. I want people to understand that this is about empowerment. I get that, but- You know what? Let's go to The Foundry tonight. I need to get out. Really? Oh no. Look who's here. It's fine. I'm fine. Really. Hey. Oh, hi. How're you doing? Pretty good. How about you? I'm all good. What're you doing later? Uh... I don't know. You wanna hang out? Yeah, that would- that would be awesome. Cool. So you wanna meet me and my buddies back at the dorm? What buddies? [ laughs ] Come on, Belle. It'll be fun. We can make a video of our own. I mean, that's- that's your thing, right? [ knocking ] [ Guy ]: Hey, slut! [ Guy2 ]: Hey Belle, wanna make a movie? [ Guy ]: Come on out, we know you're horny! Hey! Campus security is on its way! You better get out of here! What am I supposed to do? They're gone. But they're not gonna stop. And my name's not Belle, it's Miriam. It's fantasy! She's a character! Excuse me, professor. I have a question about my thesis. No. No, no, no. I'm sorry. Don? What's the problem? I was not told that the actor would be, like, 50. I've been super clear that I don't wanna book any scenes with any co-star over 35. You were serious? Yes. Well, I apologize, it'll never happen again. But the crew is here and they're ready to work. Let's go. I'm not comfortable with this. If you don't do the scene you'll be labeled "difficult". It's your call. That's a good girl. And action. Excuse me, professor? I have a question about my thesis. [ moaning ] Oh, yes! Oh yeah, baby! Oh, right there. Don't stop. Yes! [ moaning ] Cut! They're not ready for my scene yet. You're studying again? How's school? I have so much work to do over the weekend. And honestly I'm having a hard time concentrating on anything. Now that I got outed on campus it has been so stressful. Did you talk to your parents yet? No, I can't. You have to. They're gonna find out. What if they never wanna talk to me again? No matter what, it's better that it comes from you. Just do it. If you're afraid to call you can text. Does your mom text? It's like pulling a Band-Aid off. It's gonna be ok. I don't know if it is. [ phone rings ] What do I do? It's ok. Take a deep breath. You can do this. Mom? Miriam, what are you talking about? What does this text even mean? Mom, um... I wasn't selling pot last semester. I was filming adult videos. What? Pornography? No, you can't be serious. Well, I mean, porn is just a business and it's an honest job. What are you thinking? I knew that you and dad had enough financial pressure on you and I didn't wanna add to your stress. Mom, believe me, it's gonna be fine. No, it's not gonna be fine. Do you understand what you've done? All the hard work, all your accomplishments? You've just thrown them away! [ sobbing ] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I've gotta go. [ sobbing ] Giles is an all-women's hall so hopefully it'll be a little more quiet. I hope so. I hate moving. I'm gonna miss you. Hello, I'll be over all the time. Skank. [ laughing ] Ignore them. No. You know what? I'm not gonna ignore them. Hey, what'd you say? Nothing. No, actually you called me a skank but now you're not gonna say it to my face. You don't have to get all psycho. Wow. Psycho and skank? Because that's what women who speak their minds and make decisions about their own bodies are, right? But you're, like, doing people for money. I mean, it's embarrassing. I made a choice. You don't have to agree with it, but the fact you fell the need to discriminate against me and shame me is really sad. Good for you. Come on. [ phone ringing ] Oh, hold on. I'll be right there. Hello? Can I speak with Miriam Weeks please. This is she. Hey. So... that was someone from CNN. They want to interview me. Really? I think I'm gonna do it. My next guest was just another student at Duke University. Now she's known as Belle Knox and she's acting in porn to pay her tuition. You are probably right now pound-for-pound the most infamous student in America. How do you feel about that? It's totally surreal. I mean, suddenly all these strangers know who I am and have an opinion about me. I could have never imagined this. As a feminist, as a woman in women's studies, taking part in porno- pornographic scenes sort of puts uncomfortable, unnecessary stereotypes about there for- for lots of men to think is the norm. To me, feminism is not about acting masculine or feminine, it's about having the right to act in any way we choose. There will be lots of people watching this who will be feigning outrage and yet, secretly, probably looking at porn quite regularly themselves. Do you think there's a hypocrisy in the way that people treat pornography in America? Of course. You know, something like 80 percent of all online traffic goes to porn sites. She's only eighteen or nineteen, so I think we underestimate how, you know, immature and naive she is. Definitely. We like to say that, you know, porn is ok, whatever, it's just a job. Maybe she doesn't identify with it. She probably thought that I'm gonna go out there, do this, it's just a job, it's not who I am- I think you're right, and... but... also, you gotta own up to what you do though. Because at some point it can become who you are. If I'm honest, I've got a young daughter, very young, only two years old, but if she, when she is your age, decided to do this, I would be pretty upset as her father. [ laughs ] I think the important thing is whether the person is doing it by choice. If you have a choice I don't see why anyone would have a problem. The choice for me felt really natural. I've always been very comfortable with my sexuality and I've been watching porn since I was twelve years old. [ crowd murmurs ] You know, you're a guest on our show, I don't- I don't want to make you feel any kind of bad, it just... for someone to say that "I've been watching porn since I was twelve years old, "and it empowers me", to me it sounds like you have something completely memorized, uh, that you're saying. I just- my heart breaks. It really does. [ crowd cheers ] Are you getting hostility from men or women? Definitely more from women. I can't even go out without being harassed. I think a lot of women feel insecure having a porn star on campus and they're probably mad because their boyfriends are watching my stuff. Did she really just say that? What about us? We've totally supported her. [ knocking ] Come in. Hey! Did you see Piers Morgan yesterday? He was so brutal. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. You really rubbed some people the wrong way when you said women on campus don't support you. Oh, that's not what I meant. Well, that's what it sounded like. You have an entire community of women rallied behind you. I mean, maybe that doesn't work for the story, but I just don't think that's cool. Jolie, that's really not how I meant it. I guess I just wasn't thinking. Well, if you're gonna be saying stuff on TV you need to think. You can't just say stuff like that. It's ok, I'll get over it. I just wanted you to know. Ok. Are you going to do another interview? No, I'm going home. [ sighs ] We just don't understand. Why didn't you come to us? I knew you guys didn't have the money. You will always be our daughter, and we love you, Miriam. But I'm heartbroken. I just don't think you've really thought through what this is going to mean for the rest of your life. I know what I'm doing, daddy. Do you? Paul. Paul, wait! Where are you going? I have nothing to say to you. Paulie... So you sell these panties to old dudes? Well, the fans buy them when you sign autographs at these conventions. They'll pay, like, 50 bucks, so... Wow, weird. It's all part of building my brand, or whatever. I can't believe Paul won't talk to me. Give him time. Well, it's really just unfair. How did you expect them to react? They're conservative and Catholic. And you're their little girl. I just wanted a little support. Well, they have a right to their feelings, too. How do you feel? I mean... when were you gonna tell me? We've known each other our entire lives, and I kinda feel like I was the last person to know. I really wanted to tell you, but... I guess I thought that if anyone back here knew about it, it would make it real. You can't keep the truth from me like that anymore. We're best friends. I know. I won't. How often do you have to get tested? Every two weeks. I have to do it to be able to film scenes. Isn't it scary? I mean, aren't you afraid you're gonna get something? Well, yeah, of course. But everyone tests, so it's safer than hooking up with guys at school. And it's a lot more fun because it's on my terms. Do you really think that? Yeah, I do. I mean, when I'm in porn land I feel welcomed. Like those are my peers. You can be whatever you want and you won't get judged. At school everyone judges me and they- they put me into categories. It's empowering to be who I want to be. You're really good at crafting arguments. I've seen you making cases on the debate stage, I saw you doing it again on talk shows. But you're not on a talk show right now. You're talking to me. And I feel like you're trying to sell me on something. I mean, if you feel so empowered and if you love what you're doing so much, why do you seem so unhappy? Love you. I love you, too. Will you please tell Paul that I love him and I miss him? I will. Going to the airport? Yep. Where are you headed? Vegas. Vegas, baby. Man, that's my town. What's the occasion? Bachelorette party. Better be careful. People get pretty wild and crazy in Vegas. Hey, wait. You're that girl. You're that porn girl that went to Fernwood Prep. I got a celebrity in my car. Oh, yeah, I guess. What's your name again? I gotta watch your movies. Belle. Belle Knox. Why don't you come sit up front with me, Belle Knox? [ dance music plays ] Hi there, sir. Belle. You're a naughty schoolgirl? Yes I am. I go to Bad Girl University. Sign my picture? Sure. That's $20. Can I take my picture with you? Ok. How about if I hold onto you a little bit just like that? Yeah. Well, can I get a kiss on the cheek? Ok. Man. You are so hot! What're you doing later? Or should I say who? I'm a very busy girl. I bet you are. Hey Belle, tell them about your new sex toy line coming out next month. Sometimes I'm a very naughty girl. I bet you need lots of spankings. I do. I can't get enough of 'em. I'd like to bend you over and teach you a lesson for being so bad. I can help discipline. Uncooperative little girls are my speciality. Excuse us. How are you doing, sweetie? I'm ok. Yeah? This is intense. I know, but just keep your head in the game. Forget about all the gossip. What gossip? Oh, it's nothing. Just some girls are complaining and calling you a diva. It's nothing, really. Just typical stuff. It's gonna be ok. Ok? Looks like you did quite well. Yeah, I guess. I still have to pay for hair and makeup and travel, so maybe I made like $500. But you didn't have to go down on anyone. Yeah. Hey, have you heard that people have been calling me a diva? Don't worry about that. Why would anyone say that? Belle, you're new. You're hot. You booked a lot of jobs. The other girls, they're just jealous. But I really want people to like me. They do. [ shutters snapping ] Over here. Dora. Hey, what's going on? Nothing, we're just heading inside. Um, no. Something's wrong. Why don't your friends like me? Listen, you're really pissing people off with all your press. I was just trying to put out a positive message. Talk to you later. [ shutters snapping ] [ sobbing ] You ok? Yeah, I'm fine. I tell you what. If you ever feel like you're becoming your alter-ego, that's when you should be worried. You have to keep fantasy separate from reality. That's how you protect yourself. They're waiting for you out there. Good luck. On behalf of the Risqué Awards Committee, I am especially excited to present our final category. And the winner for Best Newcomer goes to... Belle Knox! Alright! [ applause ] Thank you. Oh my gosh, you guys. I just- I want everyone to know how much this award means to me. I really love this business, so thank you for being like my new famy. [ applause ] There goes the spokesperson for the entire industry. Belle Knox. Dora. Hey, can I hang with you? No. Go find someone else to cling onto. Why are you being like this? You really don't get it, do you? Nobody asked you to go on every show and blog and speak for us. You've been in this industry for five minutes and you don't know what you're talking about. But you love that spotlight and I guess that's the most important thing, huh? No, I- I was trying to help. Yeah, trying to help yourself. None of us need or want your help, ok? I thought we were friends. We hung out a couple of times but we hardly know each other. Wow, are you really that naive? Hey, baby. Don? It's just- just me. What are you doing in my room? Get out! [ slurring ] Don't worry about it. I just- I told front desk we were friends. And maybe greased the wheels a little bit. Get out of my room! Relax. I got money. How much do you need? Get out of my room! I don't want your money! Get out! Get out! Get out of my room! Go! Ok, you're right. Are you checking out, too? Can you believe they're having some sort of smut convention here? I mean, I was told this is a good hotel to bring my family to. I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind. These people are disgusting. We can't stay here. Yeah, it's crazy. You go to Duke? That is an excellent school. Your parents must be proud. [ sobbing ] [ knocking ] Be right there. Hey. What's going on? Can I come in? Yeah, sure. Where are you coming from? An adult industry convention. I don't want to talk about it. I just want to make sure we're ok. Yeah. We're ok. It's just... you have this whole other world that you're a part of and it's not easy to relate to sometimes. I know. I just... I thought I had found this whole other family and this place where I sort of belonged. But it really wasn't like that at all. And you have been so awesome and so supportive and I am so grateful for that. You're wearing my necklace. That's what friends do. What you're trying to do, it's a lot. It's a lot to take on. It'd be a lot for anyone. This all started because I just wanted to pay for school and now everything has gotten so out of control. It's like I blinked and my entire life changed. You made a choice. And you owned up to it. So who cares if other people judge you? The last few months have been crazy, but you're only eighteen. You're not supposed to know everything. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Thank you, Jolie. I'm just not really sure what I'm supposed to do next. Anything you want. Having sex on camera is not the only thing you're good at, that's for dang sure. [ laughs ] Thanks. Any time. I grew up in a very conservative family. And while I remain conservative economically, I feel much more socially liberal and in line with libertarian ideals and themes such as free speech, choice, and autonomy when it comes to what you do with your own body. Whether I choose to be a sex worker or a social worker, I don't need the government telling me how and what to do and interfering with my personal liberty. [ cheering ] [ applause ] Hey, Miriam. Can we talk? We'll just be over here. Last time we did that things didn't go too well. I tried to be fair. I was much kinder than those talk show hosts. That's true. I know you tried to be fair. But I'm trying to keep a low profile, so... Just out of curiosity, are you still doing porn? I mean, off the record. Let's just say I'm re-focusing some of my energy on the bigger picture. What is the bigger picture? I mean, what's next? Politics. Really? Like you want to run for office? One day. How will you do that? I mean, your videos will always be online. Our generation is changing the world. And so is the stigma associated with a lot of lifestyles that have generally been on the fringes. I believe that because I believe in our country and I believe that people are good. Don't you? I'm not sure. I'd like to. I admire how you've handled everything. I don't know what I would have done. Well, you probably wouldn't have done porn in the first place. [ laughs ] Yeah, probably not. You're a tough chick, though. I'm glad you're looking to the future. We can only move forward. Take care of yourself. You too. Hey, Miriam? I have to go. It was really nice to see you. It was nice to see you, too. Oh, Miriam. [ shutter snaps ] ♪
