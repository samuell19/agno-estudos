Sir, we're ready. MILITARY SECTOR, BUENOS AIRES AIRPORT - JUNE, 1977 Up! Go on!Walk! No! Up! Now! Get inside, now! Here we are again in another shithole. - Like all the destinations you've had. - Please shut up, Emilce. COLONIA ELENA INN Good morning! - Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. - I need to make a call to Buenos Aires. - Of course, there's the phone. - Yes, please. - Go ahead. - Here. - Thanks, Anselmo. Do I owe you anything? - No, it's paid for. - OK. - Could you sign here? - Sure. Thank you. Goodbye. Good morning, Rogelio. Sorry to bother you at home. I guess you already know... Yes. Yes, yes. That's how it happened. Of course I want to go back. I'm just about to retire. I know, but I thought that maybe you... I understand, sir. No. I won't do that. Definitely, no. I'm really surprised. I thought you'd say something else. Then we have the same problem. I also have my limits. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - How much is it? -100 pesos for three minutes. Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Do you remember what you have to do? - I'll ask them about you. You said goodbye, went to work, and never came back, nor called. - And I'm very worried. - Yes. They'll ask you lots of questions to try and find me. Mention all my destinations you know. They don't know about this place or about my friendship with Alberto. There is no way they will get here, OK? What? Do you want to say something? - It's nothing. - Come on, say it. What a sad ending. Yes. Yes. Constatino will call you. Don't trust him. No matter what he or his wife says. I'm worried about you, not just me. I don't want him to bother you. Understand? Take care, Tomés. Yes,you too. Hi! I'm a friend of Alberto's. I'll wait for him here. My dear Polaco! What a surprise! Alberto! You can stay here as long as you want. You can't imagine how convenient it is for me that you're here. - Who's that boy who was here? - Luis? He's a good boy, trust him. - Except flying, he can do anything. - Does he live here? No, in a ranch in the village. He lives alone, he's an orphan. In this note you can find our upcoming services, -and the coordinates for each batch. - OK. When there's too much work I stay here so I don't have to go back and forth. Sauce Grande is more than 9O km away. Fine. - Do you have animals? - I used to. They are now part of the car the superintendent bought. He's a rustler. A criminal son of a bitch. Avoid him. There are working clothes in that closet for you to wear. And some supplies in that unit. It's not much. Don't worry, Alberto. I'll manage. Use the van. Your car screams outsider. You should keep a low profile. Thanks, Alberto. - I hope I can pay you back some day. - Don't mention it. This is your house. Help yourself. Come here. Good. Good. Is that your dog? No, he showed up last night. He was hurt, he might be a stray. He's not a stray. They run away when they are beaten. - You'll need to name him if he's staying. - I already did. - What? - Zorro. - Have a good flight. - Thanks. What the hell? Shit! - Are you OK, man? - Yes. You? Yes, but that was close. We almost didn't make it. Sorry, the engine died, I had no option. I'm the superintendent of Colonia Elena. I'm Alberto Tejero's pilot. - I knew that plane. Do you want a ride? - No, don't worry. There aren't so many people around here. I'd appreciate it if you'd take me to the village. I'll find help there. Sure, but let's move it, because someone could come. Here. That way. Now downwards. I hadn't seen you around. You're not from here, are you? No. - Where are you from? - Buenos Aires. Portefio! Portefios are nice. It's very beautiful there. That maneuver you did between the trees... You're not a rookie. Am I wrong? Those things happen. It's just a routine. Do you plan on staying long? As long as they need me. You're not too chatty for a portefio. - I really appreciate your help. - I'm Pedro Velarde. And you are...? - Tomés. Thanks again. - You're welcome. Polaco, let's go! A plane is just a plane. What's important is that you're safe. You need to let go. It's not easy. I shouldn't have flown. You're a good guy, Polaco. Don't doubt yourself. Looks familiar? That was my dad's, right? When your dad left the company he gave his life for, he was offered big money, but he had to approve some dubious balances. Instead of grabbing a pen, he grabbed a lighter and set them on fire. I didn't know about the fire. Many years with me. Thank you. That's where you come from. Don't forget. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Do you have cylinders? - Yes, I'll bring you one. - Did something happen to Alberto? - No, I'm just working for him. - How much? - Please pay inside. - Hello. - Hello. - I have to pay for a cylinder. - Yes, it's $330. I saw you shopping a few days ago. Have you moved here? - No, I just came to help a friend. - Yes, I saw his pickup there. Here. - Don't you have any change? - No, sorry. You can pay some other time. - Really? - Yes. Well,thank you. Do you want anything else? No. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye. Mr. Tomés! I found a job. A field to clean up. Since the plane isn't flying... - Do you mind? - No, don't worry. I'll manage. Thank you so much. It will only be a couple of days. - Hello. - Hello. Whiskey neat, please. Hello, darling. - Would you like some fun? - No,thank you. If you change your mind, I'm right there. Another cafia. Welcome to the temple. That gentleman's drink is on me. - Good morning, how are you? - Good morning. Going shopping? Yes, some stuff. - I still owe you for the cylinder. - Don't worry, pay whenever you want. I can pay, I have some change. $330, right? Yes. - Here,thank you. - Thank you. I'm off to the hangar. Do you want a ride? No,thank you. OK. - See you. - God willing. If Super sees his wife talking to the grunt, she'll be in trouble. What did you just say? Sorry, I... Repeat what you just said! I said if he sees her talking to a stranger... Not a stranger! You said "grunt". Don't try to fool me. Come with me. Superintendent, please... What's going on? Why did you call the guy who was with Nancy a grunt? - Because he is. - How the hell do you know? He asked for a call to Buenos Aires and I saw his badge as he paid for it. - Shut the fuck up! - Shut it! Did you get to see his surname? - His surname! - Kóblic. Why didn't you tell me earlier that he was from the military? I don't know. I didn't think about it. Don't you know me? Don't you know you have to tell me everything? - Yes... - Have you forgotten who's in charge here? - Don't you ever forget! - No, superintendent. - Never! You hear me? - I promise, sir. No, superintendent! Sorry, I thought no one was there. Electricity went off and Enzo is out. - But if you need gas, maybe I can manage. - No, I still have some. - Can I help you with that? - Yes. - Where do I put it? - Thank you. Just right there. - Yes. - There. - Thank you. - No problem. This happens every once in a while. Some wire is burned and electricity goes off. Is it true that you landed on the road? - You already know that. - One knows everything here. I guess. Aren't you scared of having such a dangerous job? It's not so dangerous if you know what you're doing. - Have you ever flown? - Me? No. - And I wouldn't like to. - Would you be scared? I don't know. - I like other things. - Sure. Such as...? Have I just asked something I shouldn't have? - I was never asked that question. - Never? Never. - I'm sorry. - No, I am sorry. Sorry. I'd better leave. Excuse me, sir. - Luis is here. - Let him in. Come in. Take a seat. With your permission. Why do you look so scared? The sergeant came to my house looking for me, but he wouldn't say why. Don't worry, you're not under arrest. - Do you want a smoke? - No,thank you. Why am I here, superintendent? I just wanted to have a little chat with you. Tell me, Luisito. That aviator friend of Mr. Alberto's... What do you know about him? I know he came to work with Mr. Alberto in the fumigation. I already know that. I meant something else. Haven't you noticed anything strange about that guy? Strange, like what? - I don't understand. - What don't you understand? Are you dumb? - Don't you know what is strange? - Yes, but I haven't noticed anything. Mr. Tomés is a good man. He's good to me and to Mr. Alberto. - I only know him from work. - What work? Their plane hasn't worked for weeks. Yes, but Mr. Tomas is taking the chance to fix a lot of things at the hangar. Listen carefully to what I'm going to say. Today more than ever you need to be careful with those you don't know. Many people say they're one thing, but they're something else. Do you understand? Fine. Listen to me. If you notice anything, however stupid it may seem, come and tell me immediately. - Is it clear? - Yes, superintendent. And don't ever think of trying to lie to me. Or trying to hide something from me. Otherwise, you'll know me for real. - Understood? - Yes, superintendent. Now go. And don't tell anyone about our private man-to-man talk. Now go. Excuse me. Come in. Tell me, colonel, are you satisfied with the performance of my men? If you want to raise my commission, say it. No, I'm not here to discuss money. I'm here because there's been some grunt around my patch for a while now. I wonder who sent him. In Colonia Elena there are no subsidies, nobody cares about that crappy hamlet. - How do you know he's from the military? - The postman saw his documents. He's here to pilot a crop-spraying plane, but the plane isn't flying. And yet he's still there. Maybe some comrade of yours... is trying to steal our business. That's a possibility. - What's his name? - His surname is Kóblic. His first name is Tomés. Mind your business. I'll take care of this. Come on, leave! At your service, Colonel. Can you believe the bank has returned my checks? Where the fuck did I put the delivery notes? I must go to La Plata so that the supply from the tank trucks is not cut off. I won't be back tonight. Perhaps tomorrow. - Enzo, I'm not feeling well. I'm leaving. - Get well. Tell me. How did you end up in this place? I go where my job takes me. But this is awful. I don't have anywhere to go. Otherwise, I would have left. Were you born here? No. I came to live here around ten years ago. Where's your family? Let's not ask questions. Right. - Good morning, Enzo. - Good morning, superintendent. Fill it! - Are you stupid? Give me the good one! - Excuse me, I didn't realize. - Where's Nancy? - She left early. - Strange to see the old man in the plane. - Maybe it's the other pilot. Motherfucker... You have food in the kitchen. I already had dinner on the road. I couldn't sort out things today. I'll go back to Buenos Aires tomorrow. I need to travel on a light stomach. Omar, please, I'm half asleep. Omar, please leave me alone! - You can sleep, I'll do my thing. - I don't want to! Leave me alone! - How do I need to say it? - You're my wife, you'll do as I say! - I'm not your wife, you know that. - You are my wife! What the fuck is wrong with you? Come here! Open the door! Don't make me knock it down! Open it! Open the door! - Come here! - No! What the fuck's wrong with you? - What? - Leave me alone! - What's wrong? - Leave me! Tell me! What's wrong with you? Is he coming back in the afternoon? Well, if you see colonel Bonilla today or tomorrow or whenever, please tell him to call me. Thank you. Fucking grunt! I thought you were out. Is something wrong with you? I think Nancy is cheating on me. Are you sure of that? You haven't heard anything? Nothing at all. - I'll kill that motherfucker like a dog. - Wait! Don't get obsessed. Maybe you're just imagining it. If you find out anything, please, let me know. Of course, you can trust me. - Good morning, Enzo. - Mr. Omar, how are you doing? Fine. Tell me. Have you seen anyone here lately like... ...talking to my wife? No, I don't think so. Fine, I'm going to Buenos Aires. See you the day after tomorrow. - OK, Mr. Omar. - Forget what I just asked. - What's up, Cosme? - Look, Velarde came to ask about your friend, the pilot. He wants me to talk to him, to get information out of him. I didn't ask him why. I'm not going to ask you either. - Thank you, Cosme. - Bye. - Hello! - Hello! - How are you doing, Alberto? - Fine. - What happened? - I'm having trouble starting it. - I'm cleaning the spark plugs. You OK? - Yeah. Have you had any issue with the superintendent? I haven't, why? - Luisito, how are you! - Fine! - Can you prepare some mate? - Yes, Mr. Alberto. He's asking questions. He wants to know about you. The whole village is on the alert. I have a friend in Mendoza. He'll help you. I'm going to my granddaughter's birthday. I'll call him from my daughter's house. Alberto, you've done a lot for me. Don't worry, I'll manage. No way. Make up your mind about Mendoza. I'll be back in three days, and you'll leave. Alright, thanks. SPARE PARTS - These are new, Nancy? - Yes. - You have to pay inside. - Yes, thanks. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Is it the cylinder? Yes. How much is it? -$330. - These, Nancy. How much are they? Yes, give me a second. Here. Your change. The brushes cost... ".450 pesos. Take a seat. Look... I've been thinking. And... I don't have evidence of anything, but since you were so sure that Nancy was seeing someone, I put two and two together. There's a guy. That pilot who came to work with Mr. Alberto. He's living in the old man's hangar. Have you seen him around? No. Well... I saw him once... chatting with Nancy. And she... She was giggling- I must confess I had a bad feeling about it. Because I have my instinct. But I didn't worry about it until you came to ask me. I may be wrong. But there's something else that is not quite right. That guy came to work on the old man's plane. But the plane broke down how long ago? And the guy's not leaving. He's still there. Why is he still there? He'll leave. The motherfucker will leave in a coffin! Wait, calm down! Drink this. You don't know anything. I didn't tell you anything. Only if you're careful. Alright? First I'll kill that pilot, and then I'll come for you! Put it up. Good morning, is Mr. Alberto there? No. - Are you the new pilot? - Yes, why? What did she say about me? What did she say? First I'll kill you and then her, you son of a bitch! Just die! It wasn't you, it was me. Do you understand? Listen to me. This is my responsibility. You're not involved in this. Go to the village. Make yourself seen. Like you've been working the fields. Don't show up around here. SUPERMARKET Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Any news? - None, sir. - Hasn't Super come to see me? - No, sir. - He hasn't called? - No, sir. He hasn't. The license plate is B... ...1525... ...835. Yes. The owner is Omar Olivera Montes. Monies'.! As soon as you know anything, call me. Luis! - Are you going to Mr. Alberto's place? - No. I just came to buy my lunch. Did you see Super near the hangar yesterday? I haven't been there for a few days. I've been working with the Magdanas. Is something wrong? No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Go on, go do your stuff. - Excuse me. This way. Hello, Nancy. Come in. - Mr. Zaldivar is the district judge. - Pleased to meet you. - What happened? - Please take a seat. Mr. Zaldivar will explain. Your husband's car has been found. - I'm not married. - Then your partner's, Mr. Olivera Montes. At a supermarket parking lot in the town of Loma Rosa. Tell me, Nancy, is there any reason why Omar went to Loma Rosa? I don't know. He's always traveling. Sometimes he leaves for a few days, but... What happened? Nancy, we don't want to startle you. Probably everything's fine. But the judge here thinks... ...we need to send an alert to find him. First of all, we need you to report your partner's disappearance. Alright. Where should I do that? Right here. Your data, please? My ID number: 4370 O31. -33 years old. - Your name? Nancy... ...Adriana. Your surname? Olivera Montes. No,yours. Olivera Montes. Do you have the same surname as your partner? He's my uncle. Where do I need to sign? - Can I go? - Yes, of course, Nancy. Sergeant Romero will take you home. - Please let me know if you have any news. - Sure, Nancy. Excuse me. I had to go to the police station and sign a report so they can search for Omar. - Are you a suspect? - No. - Did they mention my name? - No. But they've found his car. What are we going to do? Staying here is too dangerous for me. I have to go. Alberto got me a place. When he gets back, I'm off. - When will he be back? - Today, I think. - Take me with you. - I can't, Nancy. - Please take me with you. - I can't. We need to buy some time, so that they forget about it. Trust me. When the moment's right, I'll come for you. Mr. Alberto! Excuse me, I didn't mean to startle you. Listen. I know you don't like me. You may have your reasons. But I'd like to have a little chat with you. We don't have anything to talk about. Yes, we do. Kóblic. He's a pilot friend who took my place. And what is it that you don't want to tell me? I don't have anything else to tell you. - I'm all ears. - Go fuck yourself! Oh, yeah? Let's see what you say after this. - Son of a bitch! - Say it, for fuck's sake! - Son of a bitch! - Who's Kóblic? What the fuck is he doing here? Say it! Alberto! Alberto! Alberto! Alberto! Why do you think something happened to Alberto? You ask me why? When I got to the hangar, His trunk was open, a box was on the floor, and the key inside. I looked for him everywhere and I couldn't find him. It's weird, yeah. But he's a well-loved man. Who would want to hurt him? Unless... - Luis had an issue with him. - No, no. "A fight? "No! - He was acting weird. - Luisito has nothing to do with this. He hasn't gone to the hangar in quite a while. I'm a policeman, I need to look for suspects. It's my job, OK? But I wonder whether there's something bigger behind all this. I don't understand. Nowadays... Something very similar happened to a friend of mine, the service station owner. He hasn't been seen for a while now. Like he's vanished into thin air. Only his car has been found. We have two cars. Their owners are missing. Don't worry, I'll call the departmental police and we'll clear this up. I hope so. As soon as you know anything about Alberto, let me know immediately. I'll keep looking for him. You too. I mean, if you learn anything from my friend, I'd appreciate it. - Mr. Tomés. - What? - I want to go with you. - Didn't you come -on horseback? - I mean, to Mendoza. Good morning, captain Kóblic. Let me introduce myself. Captain Sanchez Ligure. We met on the circle many years ago. I'm retired now. I'm very glad that you haven't missed the appointment. Let's find some quiet place. How did you find me? A certain Colonel Bonilla. The army. Mayor Sousa Grande has been doing some research. - I don't know him. - He does know you, at least your name. Where are your people? What people? I came alone. We're among honorable people. I thought I wasn't honorable for you. Don't say that. Don't blame yourself for a moment of weakness that anyone can have. Is it really worth losing everything when you're months away from retirement? And for such a stupid thing? Hiding like an outlaw. You're an army official, for God's sake! You don't deserve any of this. Look, I came to give you peace of mind. To offer you the chance that a man like you deserves. I appreciate it. Because, honestly, I don't know what... It's quite easy. Show up tomorrow early in the morning, fulfill your duty and it will be as if nothing happened. Don't miss this chance. I'll be waiting for you tomorrow morning. Don't let me down. We're approaching the area. Proceed! Open the gate! Open the gate! What's wrong, Kóblic? Open the gate! What the fuck is wrong with you? Open the gate! The lieutenant will be in charge. Leave the cockpit now! Fucking coward! What? Come on! So I can throw you with the others. Sit down! - Open the gate! - Yes, sir. Come on, get in! If I'm not there when the sun goes down, go to Madariaga. Leave the car, take the bus, and come back like nothing happened. Don't take any other route or you might be stopped by the police or the military. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Here, just in case. You'll give it back next time we meet. - Have a good trip. - Thanks. Captain, this has gone too far. Let's not make things worse. Let's talk things... Kóblic! Kóblic!
