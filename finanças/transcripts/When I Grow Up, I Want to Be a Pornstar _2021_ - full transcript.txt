Oh, madame… What is the state of this place? Where is father? Listen to me, Hazel. Father… Call me Ara. Someone might hear you. You're the only one left who still calls me that. Like me, we can feel the death pangs of the industry that I gave life to. I sacrificed my own life, I didn't get to have my own family. I wasn't blessed with a beautiful wife. But like you, I had plenty of children. But among all of them, you are… your favorite? Yes, my most favoured. Beautiful, strong, intelligent. Even if you're a pain in the ass. You can stop taking on sexy roles. In the midst of your fame, you will study hard. And not only study... you will make it your life's work. You will not only breathe life back into the sex industry of the Philippines give it a new look, a new life. Consider it a fair exchange for the life I blessed you with. You will have everything you need. I have arranged everything with my people. Do not fail me. Promise me this. I promise, father. Father? Father? Father is dead… Ma'am, would you like a BJ? I don't want Buko Juice, I prefer Coke. A feel for luck. Oh, god! Hey, my dears. Could you lend me a hand? Just push my car. - Okay, ma'am. - Thank you. Alma Cares… Hmm… impressive! You see this all the time in K-Dramas. People showing off their wealth. You know what, I'm not the brightest at Math but I think it's just the three of us here. That's right. So I guess, we are still waiting for someone? Actually, I have been waiting for you. Enough, ladies. This is a sacred place. Have you heard of her? Her name is Linda Lovelace. An American pornstar who starred in a movie called Deep Throat. She played a bit part in one of father's films in the 70s. Yes, I know her! She's the one with a vagina in her throat so she loves to… …that's what she loves. Excuse me. It's not a "vagina". "Clitoris." She has a clitoris down her throat that's why she needs to perform a deep throat to achieve orgasm. Where can you find the clitoris? In the vagina, right? Hey, easy! I feel like my clitoris moved to my butt. Did it move back? That's enough, ladies. We need to go to the orientation room real quick. We have a long list in our agenda. Some kind of a librarian? Well, this is the library of most controversial files. Okay. You keep pulling a fast one. Alma Cares… Well, I'm sure you have an idea why I summoned you here. What's this about? Are we making a movie? For Netflix? A reality show? How about an orgy, game? Well, actually… It's a combination of what you've said, and more. More than 50 years ago, a vision was born. A man and his vision. Papang founded Molo films with his sweat, tears, and blood. And of course, his seed. She said seed. Nasty! The Bomba Films industry was on fire. Pene movies movies was dominating the box office. After the Marcos years were over, the porn industry took on a new face and became more conservation. Because people's urges were repressed, even softcore porn garnered audiences in the 80's. In the 90s, in the twenty-first century. But as they say, nothing lasts forever. On the onset of the internet and social media, the industry of titiilating porn films saw its demise. As time passed, the public sought out new tastes. They also became more impatient. Porn videos killed the industry of porn movies. As they said in the movie "Boogie Nights", bold movies have turned solely for masturbatory purposes. Who cares about about stories, about plots, about narratives? The more staged it is, the more boring it is. The more raw the scenes seem like, the more exciting they are. Which explains why people stick to sex scandals like flies to shit. In Father's death bed, he told me that even if it drains all his wealth, nothing could revive him. Nothing. But he was sure about one thing... and that is his vision, that once saw its death, could ultimately be revived. If the taste of the public has changed, we will introduce a new formula. After careful deliberation of the company stakeholders, we came up with a simple plan. You are here because we badly need your expertise. Huh? What do you expect to gain from us has-beens? Excuse me, don't group me in that sad corner. I still have plenty of followers on every social media platform. But wait, expertise in what, exactly? As for me, all I can offer is public service. But no extra service. Alma Cares. Please take your seat, ladies. Well, you won't be playing any roles on camera. You will all be working behind the scenes. You will help grow a promising star. The next Philippine Pornstar. We will create the public's ultimate fantasy. All of you have had your individual experiences in acting, your own realities, your own scandals, your own flavors your own love potions. You mean contusions. Is this some master class for getting naked? For moaning seductively? Yeah, is it for getting the right facial expressions? Why don't you just make her marathon sex scandals? What do you need workshops for? Well, nothing beats real life application. Undressing isn't the only thing you will be teaching. Undressing one's mask. Undressing one's identity. Actually, pornography is a deeply conservative genre. Whoa, really? Conservative? Well, not everything is revealed in porn. There are no plots. It's always down to fucking. On the couch, in the kitchen, cumshot, close-up… What do they censor? The story. The pleasure is in the story. That's why people are crazy about scandals. Because they know it's real. The people in it are real. It's a real story. We're just taking a peek. And that's what we want to achieve here. We will make Bomba films that has the feel of a scandal. That's what you're here for. Because we know we can rely on you, in your own unique little ways. Am I right, Ligaya? You have mastered the craft of bringing our the joy in your viewers. Just how many times did you fake your orgasm just to satisfy your man? Just to get what you want? Because isn't it all just a game? Even the most intimate things in life are but commodities. Just objects. And we trade those commodities. We trade power for power. Sex is power. Money is power. Sex for money is but an exchange for power. But we have to control that power. Because it can explode in our palms like a bomb. Wow, very impressive. Looks like someone did their research well. Why don't we just have a round of drinks? I agree. I'll take care of that once we're done here. As you all know, I have a Masters Degree in Psychology. I invested a lot of time working with other experts in the field. Vladimir Honra. Known for being a pop culture historian and porn critic. Have you heard of him? Yago Tapado, award-winning writer. The man behind... Revenge of the Vagina! The Curse of the Virgin Breasts! I love that! They shot it in Bataan! He also directed A Vertical Cut Closes with Open Legs! That's my favorite! Lolito Ramada. No introductions needed. They will provide the theories, the gossip. The nitty and the gritty of the industry. They'll handle the theory part. You'll handle the practice. You will have your handouts tomorrow. I will have dinner sent to your quarters so you can get some rest. Phew! I'm so glad to hear that. I'm spent. The travel was tiring. So exhausted, fuck. As you all know, this invitation comes with a ready to encash cheque worth five hundred thousand pesos. But that's not all you're getting paid for this potential project. If the training and launching of our new star is successful, as well as her first porn project, we will each get 5 Million pesos each. Five million?! Where's that little squirt? Let's make her into a pornstar. - Real quick. - Right now! Let's go! - She's got the looks. - Flawless. Big boobies. Not her. That's Twinkle. She's one of our helpers in the estate. The help? Those two. Agatha and Sofia. Two girls who would do anything for the limelight. They're on every audition. They practically grew up in show business, well-versed in the needs of the industry. They've been playing bit parts since they were little. In short, exactly what we need. - They are… - horny ass bitches! …ambitious. Do you feel intimidated? A little. Just a little? You should be super nervous. Sorry, miss? You should be super nervous. You should be scared. Because you won't just be learning from seasoned bold stars. All of our experiences and wisdom we will teach you everything. So you will gain all that is right and should be. You should be nervous because four women who have had to go through many hardships will be imparting their knowledge to you about how to do things right. How to do things right? But why do we have to become pornstars all of a sudden? Why can't we be a bold star like you? Or a sexy star, whatever you guys used to call it. Believe me, you want something more than what we were. Don't you have a family, miss? What does it matter? You are my family now. Your beauty is truly one of a kind. As is yours, miss. Do you really think so? Yes, miss. But you still haven't answered my question. Which question? Why do we have to do porn right off the bat? Why don't you try producing sexy movies again? Just sexy. When was the last successful sexy film that you watched? Fifty Shades of Grey? Sex and the City? You can count it with your fingertips. Who still watches sexy movies in the cinema? When you can watch porn at the comfort of your house? Look at them. Who is still watching their old films? They have been forgotten. Worn-out. You can't even see their movies in YouTube, in Netflix. They've lost their luster. They've lost their allure. And they're broke. But the pornstars… their works will remain. The internet isn't going anywhere. At the tip of your fingertips. Sasha Grey, Maria Ozawa, Mia Khalifa. They have all retired. But they still get paid! Before I give you the syllabus of our month-long workshop. We need to discuss the breakdown of the demography of porn first. I have to discuss to you the demography of porn. What is demography? It is the statistics of the people who watch porn. Group, age, gender, preferences, etc. And here is what is interesting… Did you know that Filipinos reportedly spend the most time on porn sites? That's according to the world's number one porn sites in the world. We're looking at two factors that contribute to this. Either we have such a slow internet connection, or we're just a really horny bunch Can I smoke first? Oh, here. I have a vape. Want to try? - No, no. - Here. I'm fine. I don't want that. Your oral fixations are really showing, huh? Wait, wait. I don't get what you're trying to say. Oral frus-fay... Fixation, big sis. Fixation. Fix-a-tion. Fixation. Fine, fixation. Yes, yes. That's why I'm asking because I don't know what it means, alright? We're here to learn, aren't we? Well, in Psychology, it means you were probably stuck in your oral stage of development. Freud's Psychosexual Development. Maybe your childhood needs weren't sufficiently satisfied. You were not satisfied, or the manner of breastfeeding was wrong or excessive. As you grow up, you'll become overdependent. As you resort to persistent oral stimulation. Smoking, nail-biting. Blowjob! Whatever! All I know is I got my first milk from my father. You're too much! Take your cigar break, Osang. Five minutes. Because we are the world's top consumers that gives us a lot of hope. Father's wishes can be realized. Cinema and porn. Since 1997, the porn industry settled into the internet. Nearly 80% consumed through mobile phones. But wait, isn't there a law against showing porn in cinemas? So, do we go for online content? And we will get to that topic soon. But in the mean time, let's pick apart the demographics. So, who watches porn? According to recent statistics, it's 75% male, and 25% female. And the top consumers fall within the 18-24 years age bracket. Which is 30% So, what do you think is the most viewed category? Take a guess. Ah, Japanese! Wait! It's MILF! Mom I Like to Fuck! Celebrities! Big dick? Threesome! Scandal! Amateur. Am I right? I'm not an expert but I know that because when I watch porn, that's what I search for. I love watching amateur sex videos. You really see them fiddling nervously. You can hear the rooster's cockadoodle. The dogs barking in the background, the buzz from the news they're watching on TV even the commercial jingle while they do their thing. Correct! Genuine, you can feel the love. Intense. Whatever, I still prefer the ones in uniform and you can see the name. And when they enter the hotel Boom! You catch the name of the hotel on the bed sheets! That's just how it is. - They're pressed with time. - Motel. Just making the most of stolen moments. Correct! But what if their devices run out of memory? That's why it's an amateur video. Because they're amateurs. Why don't you just admit that I'm right? Yes, of course. You're correct. Amateur videos are the most viewed category. And you are right about your observations, why amateur videos are interesting. Back then, you needed a famous lead star to have any chance of selling. Now, you need to show some skin for a slice of the stage. Even the celebrity has-beens slither back to relevance when they're involved in a scandal. In our case, we will make our persona. Say, pretend she's a private person. We will exploit her privacy Until she becomes a household name. A sex symbol. Forever amateur. Which brings me to our syllabus of our month-long workshop. As you may notice, we left a lot of spaces to be filled in by you. Because you are here precisely to help us develop the master plan. Voyeurism. Amateur videos sell like hotcakes because of voyeurism. It's the most natural thing for humans, for Filipinos, to gossip, to get in on the action. Initial gimmick: leaked photos. Leaked photos? Leaked photos! Leaked photos. Licked photos. You mean they will have to lick the photos? Big sis Nes, leaked photos. Compromising photos released and spread to the media. Why didn't you just say "spread" photos then? Whatever. We're going to release a teaser. A sample taste. How do we do this? Your opinions matter. Okay, so we're going to come up with characters, that are based on their supposed private identities. How are we tackling damage control? I mean… how are we going to stop the people who know them in real life from revealing their true identities? Good question, Maui. I'll introduce you to our stars. You haven't met them yet. But you will, in the coming days. And your questions will be answered. I have an idea! - What? - Ex's Revenge. Guy blackmails girl, so girl comes back to him. But the girl has made up her mind but she forgot that they have a lot of their private moments captured and stored in guy's phone. So this guy, furious out of extreme jealousy, he uploads the pictures, leaked the photos on the internet Licked? Spread! God, Osang, isn't this illegal? I'm sure it's not. We won't be using a real person without their consent. It's nothing like that. I'm just making sure. Because, I care. - Alma Cares. - Fuck that. Alright, hold on a second. Let's focus. Okay. So our first gimmick is going to be the leaked pho... I mean spread photos, right? So, what? What's our plan, do we go for topless first? Yes, and it should be blurred. Okay. Blurred. No, this is what we're going to do. Let's make them wear white. Those stark white camisoles then we'll get them wet so you can see their breasts clearly, nips and all. That's going to be so wow. Eva Fonda 16, very innocent. Sounds good. Right? Then let's teach them how to get into the water and emerge in the most seductive way. - Yes! - Perfect. Soaking wet with their boobs popping out. That's it. Truly, they are windows to the soul. Not the eyes. Hmm. Interesting. The boobs are the windows of the soul. Actually, in Psychology, there's this thing called the Male Gaze Theory. Damnit, Ara. I'm getting so annoyed with you. My brain is having a hard time catching up with your brain. You're saying all these terms! I've had enough. Male gaze, according to feminists, is a way of looking at women in the eyes of men, often as sexual objects. Recent eye-tracking studies show that the male gaze is fixated on breasts and waists. Not so much on the hips or pelvis. There is also an MHR, ratio that determines the sexiness and attractiveness of a woman. Biologically, a swelling on the chest signals fertility. And wide hips signify a healthy womb. Men, as animals, just want to reproduce subconsciously and are always in search of a healthy carrier. This is our first activity, okay. This was my idea. Mine. It's ours. The wet look was all the rage back in the day. Yes. With the nipples sticking out through your shirt. You were the instigator. You're always picking on me. - No, you! - Okay, go. Now, to be an effective sexy star, you should know how to make men crazy as you come out of the water. Okay? As you rise up, give your whole body a generous feel. Your nipples… It's up to you. Point is to get the viewers feeling horny. Especially you, yeah? Yes, ma'am. Do it right or I'll smack you. Unless you hear this knocking, don't come out yet. Yes, ma'am. - You should wait for this, okay? - Yes, ma'am. - Knocking on the drums, really? - Get in there. Okay. How about you two? Man, let me tell you, back in the day, we were shooting the film Kandungan. I didn't know how to swim! Then the director told me, "you need to show them the selling point!" - She has big boobs. - So, I dove into the water. - They thought I was swimming but… - But? But my breasts were keeping me afloat. My feet were just paddling beneath the water. - You were just pretending? - Nobody noticed it when the movie came out. When you get your breasts done… they're natural floaters. You just float, huh? - They're your lifesavers. - What? Yeah, when you augment them, you'll float naturally. You will float. What? Really? - Yes! - Oh, mine are real, so. Real. I'm sorry, not to brag but I have the real thing. But for my first movie, called No Experience. That was from Regal Films... Ah, in the 60s. You motherfucker. You bastard! Wait, did they make sexy films then? - You idiot, you're so gullible. - She was joking. Was it 1976 or '77? I made the magic camison a thing! - Yes, that's true. It was her. - Oh shut up, you wore a camison too. It was so white and see through. And of course, my breasts were the real deal. See? You can see the nipples right through. They could see your undies. I looked so sexy. I had the most innocent face, right? - Hey, you better believe it. - Yes, you do. - She's right. - That's what it was about. I was starring in Eva Fonda 16 at the time when I had to do all those dances. Something like that! - Wow! - It's true! Fuck you! You keep teasing me, you bitch! Regal Films love that trope. - That camison. - Oh, wait. - Did you wear the ma... you wore it too? - I also had my version of the magic camison! I knew it! She wore the camison, too! - Everyone went through the camison phase. - True. I can never forget that time I made an action film and what they made me wear... it wasn't a camison. It was a white T-shirt with no bra underneath. They let me have shorts on, at least. Because I had to run near a dam. - A dam? - Yes. Your nipples would be the last thing on your mind. - But it was sticking out! - You didn't bother covering it up. I didn't have time, what if the dam broke, right? - Yes, yes. - And they made it into a poster without telling me! - Oh, that was with Lito Lapid! - Yes, I was with Lito Lapid! Oh, speaking of camison. Of course, it originated in Regal. - Yes. - But it reached Viva, the camison. - They adapted the camison. - Right? Another magic camison. - Yeah, Rica Peralejo and I were shooting a movie. - Uhuh. So we were at Daranak Falls. The scene went like, I was the liberated one so my nips were showing through my shirt. - And we had to French kiss. - Okay. Okay, then so we were about to kiss, getting closer. How? Can you do it again? Ugly kissing! We were both puckered up, when a snake slithered by between us out of the blue! - What? For real? - Is that true? - It is! - Good thing it didn't bite you. If only another kind of snake had passed by. Oh, big sis, who bought these drums? This one? I bought it. Just look here, of course. - It has an Alma Cares sticker. - I knew it. - Isn't it obvious? - I bought them, you got a problem with that? Nothing. You don't fit in those... - That's why you're not in one, yeah? - Let me see you try to fit in there. You're the one with the problem, fuckhead. - I can make it work. - Let me see, fuck, with those giant boobs? Hello? Ah, the other girl, it doesn't look like she's still breathing. The other one still has bubbles. Is that okay? Huh? Oh shit. Fuck, this is your fault. - Why me? - It's you. It was your idea. Hey! Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Was that okay? Yes, sure. What about you, are you okay? I'm fine, ma'am. Great, see? This one won't come out. Not following instruction. - Idiot. - Hey, wake up! You're going to get yourself in trouble. Is she okay? - Hey, are you okay, dear? - Check if she's still breathing? - Mister, is she alive? - Yes, yes, she's alive. Ah, alright. Take her away. Keep her alive. Wait, hold on. Wait a minute. Get well soon. See, I told you. She was going to get herself in trouble. Ugh, we just lost a talent. - Watch it! - It was in the way. I thought you were concerned. I am concerned. Really, Alma Cares? It's a good thing she survived. So what happens now? Well, we lost a talent. But we should still be thankful. No matter, we still have one girl left. Let's give thanks to Lord nothing serious happened to the girl. Let's not do the wet look. Let's just have her jiggle her boobs. That will do. Ah, yes. Like a sexy calendar girl. Very classy. Like those calendar girls for Tanduay. Ha! Wait, like commercials. White Castle commercial. - That's right! White Castle! - You're right. We'll need a horse. Yes, but let's not make her wear white. It should be red. To add intensity. - Red! - Bloody! Perfect! Sounds great! Erase the water scene. Go for the horse! Let's eat. Go for the horse! Alma Cares, am I right? Is it campaign period? Just let me be! - Both of you, stop it! - Fine! Okay, we're starting now. Remember: stick out your breasts and buttocks while you're riding on the horse. And don't just stick out your assets. While you're riding, you should be swaying your hair with the wind. Like so! So sexy! You're so corny! The only thing she's supposed to do is to stick out her breasts and her buttocks while she rides around. Got it? Huh? You sound like a bunch of idiots. Who are you calling an idiot? I just repeated what Maui said. So just make sure your breast smacks against your face while the horse gallops. That's sexy. Isn't that right. Did you hear them? You don't have a name yet. Don't disobey us. Just keep doing what we tell you. I'll be the one to teach you the cooler tricks. Got it? Different from what they'll be teaching you. Now, do everything that they asked you to do. But once the horse gallops, let go. What? Didn't you hear what they said? You're still green. You should be more tenacious! Do everything we asked you to! First of all, stick out your butt and your boobs while you're riding the horse. Second, sway your hair around in the wind. When you do that, it will look good in slow motion. Third, what's the third one? Smack your breasts against your face. There! You need to… I want to see your face bruised. Hey, you're too much! I was just kidding. And fourth, while you're doing all that, yeah… Let go. I'm telling you, you little shit, do what we tell you. I'm watching you. Can you do it? I can do it, ma'am! Then get on with it! What are you waiting for? - That's it! - You got! Smack your breasts against your face! Sway your hair with the wind! Sexy! Stick out your boobs and butt! - Perfect! - Here it comes! The horse is galloping! Hurry! Let go! - Good! - Let go! Let go now! Ahh! Fuck! - Fuck! - Shit! Fuck! She fell! Ah, wait. Just wait for me. Okay. Alma Cares. Now we don't have a pornstar! This is a problem. What now? This is on you, Osang. You were making the kid do weird things! You kept running your mouth. Well, who told her to smack her breasts against her face? Wasn't that you? That's why she fell. She couldn't balance her breasts. Whatever! Let's not blame each other. We need to find a new subject. Right. Let's chill and have a drink. Maybe we can make a Plan C. Plan C. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I think so. It could work. You want to have a go at the swing? You silly! We don't want to use the swing! Look behind you. We have a new student. Look at her. Ah, is that what you meant? You're crazy. Everytime you open your mouth, it's to pick on me. Ah, Twinkle. We want to propose a project. Don't worry, we'll make you into a star. But there are things we need you to do. - Please say yes. - You can do it. We will conduct workshops. - Like the one using the drum, right? - Yes, yes. Just listen to the four of us. You will dive. The truth is I know all of these. You just don't notice it, but I listened to all of your lessons. From having an ambition, why I should strive to be a pornstar. The proper way to make men go crazy. To keep the audience thrilled. How to ride a horse properly. I studied everything you don't know. What you don't know, I do. Plan C. Initial photos: leaked photos. Check. Check. - Wet shirt, nips sticking though. Check. - Check. If we have photo teasers, we should also have voice teasers. I agree. The audio teaser has to be something like… a little whimper. We used to do that back in high school. We used casette tapes, we would play it and match the voices. You used to do that too, right, Nes? Pfft! I'm a decent woman. Me getting naked was purely professional work. Yeah right! Good idea. Audio teaser. We can make it seem like a phone sex. Like your movie, yeah? And she'll send a voice recording. That's very sexy. You know, the right facial expression is important. When you whimper and moan, you've got to have the right body language that go with it. And at the same time, so you get in the groove of it, you have to… you have to show the whites of your eyes. Have you ever climaxed? Do you know what happens when a woman reaches climax? Huh? Her legs go stiff. And her back arches. And her fingers want to grab and scratch. And she bites her lips Sometimes you make the same sounds like when you're pooping. I have to agree. Even in the BPO industry, it's a rule of thumb. When you smile, you sound happy. The voice follows what the face is doing. Ah, fuck! Hey! Make it more intense. What the fuck. - Yeah! - Okay. Intense. Intense. You sound like you're trying to scare someone, you idiot. That was intense. - Geez, give it your all. - Your all! Everything! Fine, I'm giving it all. Twinkle. Oh, hey. Listen to me. Curacha, The Girl Who Never Sleeps. First day in cinemas. 77 Million, you got me? There were only 50 cinemas back then. Watch me. This part is for when you're about to climax, alright. Fuck, feels so good! Mic test. - Test. Test. - Hey! What are you doing? That's Mic's testes. Moan! You see, I just remembered our first meeting de avance Fuck that! Start moaning! Fine, here I go. Alma Cares.. Great job. Fuck, you're so good! Yay! Good work! I'm going to show you something. No one's ever done this before. This should be in the Kama Sutra. This is called The Forbidden Technique! I call it "The Tornado!" Alma Cares... So, we have leaked photos for our initial gimmick then the audio sample. The interval should probably be around a week or a month, maybe two months apart. No, it depends on the public's reaction. When we go for one month, it's a long wait. They'll tire of it. Alright, fine, a week apart. It still depends. Keep the mystery. The art of keeping them hanging. Why does it feel good to be kept hanging? It doesn't always. But it produces a certain pleasures because our brains will fill in what's missing. You know what, I think when guys so much as hear about rape in the news, they'll jerk themselves off. That's how their minds work. When they see a girl twerking, they'll think, "cowgirl position". When they see a girl eating a banana, they'll think "blowjob". When they see a girl washing her face, they'll think "cumshot". That's what makes them so easy to bait. Huh, in fairness, Cinderella's glass slipper, I bet it has some sexual undertones in between. Fetish. Keeping the prince hanging. So, are we all in agreement about the one week interval? I'm good with one week. Okay... Then we'll go for audio on week two? Okay, week four... it should be the final week. Her launch. What about week three? Right, we have an audio teaser, a leaked photo, what's next? Video. Video of what? Like you said, the one where she's eating a banana. Yeah? We're going to take a video of her eating as if she were performing a blowjob! You know what, I have a brilliant idea. Ever seen those Facebook tutorials? The ones that look like cooking shows? Those are getting lots and lots of attention. So what, we're going to make a video tutorial on doing blowjobs? Yes! It would be too vulgar to use a real penis. Then use an imaginary penis. I know, let's go for ice candy. So it looks innocent. Are you with me? I like it better. I'm fine with anything. Even the barrel man from Baguio? I'll suck on that. Let's concur. Ice Candy. Okay. Not that. Drop it. You're so annoying. You're not listening to me. Scroll down to the pink background. They're crazy about that look in social media. Heh. Do what you want. I'm just curious… when you were with sir Dolphy, would his penis get hard? Oh, you don't say. It's all it ever does. Dolphy... Why did you turn pale? - Uncle Dolphy was a kind man. - Of course. Are you scared? He might haunt us. Because we have a hard ice candy, let's start our VTR. But we can also give tips on how to give a felatio chick on this humble old ice candy. Okay, shush. Watch. This is how you do it, okay. Lick around the edges. Don't laugh, jeez. - You're being silly. - Just like that. Pretend this ice cream... I mean ice candy is a cock. What do you do when ice cream drips? You lick it. You're so good at this. That's how it's done. That's how you treat a penis. Ice candy! It's the same thing. Here, ice candy. Correct. You better listen up. Start from the bottom and work your way to the tip. This is how you do it. Just stare at it. Be quiet. You. - Here. - How? Show us, quick. God's sake! - I can't concentrate! - Hurry up. Teach her! - Is this right? - Good job! Check. I'm sorry, I don't know how to do this. This is how you do it. There we go. With feelings. Put more feelings. That's enough. - So, what. - Then, do this. You're going to bury it in your mouth, like so. When it's inside your mouth, snug. Just leave it there or about five to ten seconds. What happens when it's inside your mouth? - Push it deeper. - Deeper. It won't go any deeper. But I throw up easy. Silly girl! It's called a gag reflex. Christ. You can train your throat to be desensitized... so you won't want to throw up. Correct! - It's a big one. - Practice on it. You really know how to put it in your mouth. You're so good at this! I'm just starting. What's the matter? Is it really that big? Do you want a dick or what? Ice candy! Pfft. This will do. It's soft, wrapped in plastic. It's as good as any dick. And now that we've done everything for our three weeks of uploads Before the final week of launching. We've reached the most important part of our workshop. We're going to talk about how to roast a pig? Huh? Oh my god, that's not in the budget. Are we supposed to pay for catering, too? Wait, what were you thinking, Ara? Don't tell me our gimmick for the launch is to show Twinkle piped with a bamboo? Will she enter the press conference turning round and round? Did you really have to say "piped"? Theatrical. I like it. Yeah, and you'll both be in cauldrons. - Watch your tongue. - You sorry lot. You and your crazy ideas. That's what you get for not undergoing training from the one and only, Papang! That's right! Anyway, Osang, Nes, you'll be in charge of the preparations. And Maui, you're the voice of the cooking show. And Twinkle. You watch and learn! Watch and learn! Ingredients. Of course, we need… a pig. Make sure it's around 18 to 20 kilos. Mm, there. Okay. Next, we need salt... Salt. And black pepper. Black pepper. In Tagalog, paminta. And of course, let's not forget we all have this… soy sauce! For the glaze, make sure you have one bottle of clear softdrinks. - What's your problem? I'm thirsty! - Keep it together. - You're always pulling this shit. - Killjoy. And for the stuffings, ten bundles of lemongrass, one fourth cup of star anise, six pieces of bay leaves, cut into small pieces, five cloves crushed garlic, two kilos of onion leaves, and of course, our favorite... eight pieces of half-cooked saba. Teach me. I've already forgotten how to do it. Joey didn't teach you? G! First, shave hair follicles of the pig and remove the innards. A certain sexy star... I mean, porn star has to be flawless. Like this. She should be free of innards. Nothing but an empty shell. That way, no conscience would trouble her. And she'll have no shame. So she won't say things like, "I can't take it!" Rinse the pig and make sure there are no more lumps of blood inside the stomach. She should always be hygienic. Always with an inviting scent about her. Then rub inside with salt and pepper including the body. Salt, like salty tears. Sad experiences that add flavor to a woman. And of course, the black peppers... which represent life expectations and ideologies that got broken and crushed to pieces. Failures in life. Flavorful. Now rub a little soy sauce on the inside, belly of the pig. Don't forget about this bit. This is very important. Because all of us girls have it. A bit of crazy. Stuff the belly with saba banana. They represent all your sexual relations with men. Of course, you should know who they are. What they like, and what they really like. Ohh! These saba are so big! - What's with you? - Did sir Dolphy's look like this? Do you miss him? Put the star anise inside. The ambition, the dream. The glamour of being famous. It has a lot. And of course, don't forget, the onion green leaves and crushed garlic. Onion leaves. Things that remind you of your failures. As for the garlic... antiseptic. Your protection from intrigue and defamation. That way you don't lose your determination. And of course, the laurel leaves. Leaves. Sign of your brief education about what you are doing. That's what our workshops are for. Next, stuff the lemongrass in the center of the stomach. You should always have something up your sleeve. So they can't easily brush you off. So they wont't get tired of you! Correct! Stitched the belly, making sure that no ingredients slip out. Skewer the pig with a mid-size bamboo and split roast over hot charcoal. While slowly roasting the pig, glaze it from time to time with sprite using a sponge. This will make the skin extra crispy. You have to listen to some criticism. Constructive or not, these will make you famous. And most of all, be patient. Don't be hasty, don't be too quick to act. Wait it out. Even if you are the most delicious dish. The most inviting look, color, beauty, and the most fragrant. For a lot of people, you're still nothing but a... No matter how much you've mastered your craft, no matter how much you've mastered your craft, people will still think you are their property. Something they can eat, devour, feast upon. You may be flawless, fragrant, scrumptious… but the moment you're thrown into the fire, you're nothing but meat. I'm sorry, I really can't go a day without hearing your voice. But didn't I tell you I'll call you first? Yes, but Twinkle, I need your answer now. Just hold tight. I'm not sure about my decisions yet. What about our plans? I need to know. Please, can you be more patient? Here she is. Here comes Twinkle. Twinkle, we're live now. Say hi to your fans in Paranaque! Here we are. Hi, Ms. Twinkle! Hello, my little stars. How are you?

We're preparing for your launch tomorrow. And I'm pretty sure, your fans will have all sorts of questions. We already went over that. Wait, won't we be joining her FB live? Right, my friends over at Paranaque will be waiting for me for sure. Alright fine, here's what we'll do. Let's all join her at the start. But Twinkle will be the one to address her online fans. - Is that alright? - Go! - Okay, let's just make the introductions. - Let's do this! Hold on, let's fix the light so we look pretty. Okay! Let's go! - Go on then, click it. - We're going live, alright? Okay. - There we go. - Hello, little stars! You might be wondering why all four of us are with Twinkle today! And of course, just like each and every one of you, we are here to support our newest bombshell! And like you, we're excited for Twinkle's media conference tomorrow. So keep your questions coming but we'll save the shoutouts for later, okay? Let's start reading some questions. Here's our first one. Hi, Twinkle. I just want to ask about your skincare and also the aunties'. Who are you calling an auntie? So, guys, my skincare is nothing special. Facial wash, at night I apply some toner and moisturizer before I go to bed. You know what, I did the same thing when I was starting out. But now I go to Allura Face and Body. You can find it in Quezon City. And I used my own beauty products calle Ara Secret You can also apply to be a distributor, Contact us. That's all, okay. Me, I go to European Aesthetics. That's by Doctora Doris Velasco. And uh, all their products are imported from Belgium so you will love it there. They have an RF called Nanic RF. That's my favorite treatment. At the same time, I also use my own products. I also have a skincare line. You can find us on Instagram. Just type natureskinsecret. That's all for me. As for me, Doctora Anna Montesa attends me in her Morato clinic. She's the one who injects me with stemcell and RF, too. So as you ca see, even at my age, I don't look too shabby. Alma Cares, am I right? To manage my fats, I undergo this thing called cryoscrystals. - It's a kind of non-invasive liposuction... - Oh, okay. They freeze the fats. - Hmmm. - Yes. So you've heard all of our skincare routine. Let's move on to the next question. Hi, Twinkle. Is pink the color of your… No, let's pick this one. Hi, Twinkle. I want to ask what your favorite position is... - Maui, Maui. Look at this. - What? "Is that Maui Taylor?" - "She doesn't look like she aged at all." - Wow! "Her face still looks like it's been waxed." "Don't stick around that bitch, Twinkle." "She has an attitude problem. Feeling famous." Ah, you think I have an attitude problem? - Well, fuck you. - Shh. Hey! - I'm going to show you who's got an attitude problem! - We're live online. Fuck you! I will find you on Facebook... and when I see you, I will break you face, you fucker. Wait, here's another one. - Look, big sis Osang. You also have an admirer. - What does it say? Quick, read it. - Here's what it says. - I can't see. "Is that Rosana Roces?" "Why does she look like that? She's gotten so fat!" "She put on so much weight!" "It makes me sick!" "That's what you call karma." "Keep stuffing your face!" Fuck you! My butthole looks better than you! Osang! Osang! Wait, wait. I got something. Move over there. Move! Move! Who? Who are you calling a moron? Hey! I will have you know, I was the one who set up this live stream! And what's your basis? For saying I'm stupid? Because I pretend to not speak English fluently? You bastard! It's called Imaging. Packaging! If I want to speak in English, you know With no… no wrong gr... You son of a bitch! I prefer not to speak in English but I can if I want to! Fuck you! Fuck these bashers. Is it gone? At least I experienced what it's like to be beautiful. I was sexy, I was fantasized upon, and thousands of horny men jacked off to me! What's that bashes got to show for? Shit, he's probably not even getting laid! Hey, all of you. Jeez, you're so sensitive. You know, every little thing you do, fans will always have an opinion about it. What the fuck? Fans? You call those fans? Back then, they would hang flowers around our necks! They don't talk down on us, curse at us. What's wrong with you? Maui only meant that... Bashers and supporters are all the same. Anyone who gives you the time of day is considered a fan. They contribute to these views and engagement. Sometimes, they're the ones that make it viral. Fuck being viral. I'd rather get low views than be judged like that. Just because we work in front of the camera and they pay to watch us, does that mean they have the right to insult us? What they pay us is nothing. Does paying give them the right to swear at us? Just because we're has-beens? Hey Nes, I'm not a has-been, alright. You're the has-been. I thought I was the only idiot in this room but you're worse than me. You can't even accept reality. If I'm not famous anymore, why do I still get cast in TV series? You're not famous anymore. What kind of roles do you get? Mother roles! Mother roles! That's how you know. What, getting mother roles doesn't mean I'm not famous. You're not! You're a nobody! You're a nobody! Hey! Excuse me. I'm not a nobody. I have die-hard fans. There's tons of them. Besides, I'm a public servant. I work in public servant! That's right. The reason you ran for office is because you're not famous anymore. Fuck you, if I'm a nobody, then you're not any better. We are all nobodies! We are all nobodies! It's her turn now. We're done, Osang. We're done, Nes. They've already used us up as much as they could. The only thing left that they can do... is to compare us to the new ones. We've long budded and bloomed. Don't you know that? They've plucked out all our petals. We've shown them everything, they sniffed the last whiffs of our scents. Our aroma has faded, gone is our fragrance Our careers are over. We're not fresh anymore. We're rotting. If we were flowers, we'd be all dried up. They won't even offer us to the dead. We're dried up flowers. We've all become dead flowers. Oh, how fragrant Oh, how fragrant this flower is. When I take a whiff, when I take a whiff. When I take a whiff, what pleasure! Fragrant, so fragrant, feels so good, feels so good. To smell the flower. Oh, it's so big, so big. Oh, how big this flower is. Oh, it's so red, so red. Oh, how red this flower is. So big and so red the color of the flower. The flower blooms, and in comes the queen. She'll dance the cha-cha, what a joy! What a joy! Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. Oh, it's so thick, so thick. Oh, how thick this flower feels. There are tiny ones. There are smelly flowers, too. There are thick ones, there are wispy ones. Flowers of different kinds. The flower blooms, and in comes the queen. She'll dance the cha-cha, what a joy! What a joy! Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. We need flowers in our lives. To make the world more colorful. Flowers, flowers. We need flowers in our lives. Make sure everything looks good. How? Cheers. - Make sure everything looks good. - Yes, ma'am. There you go. Very nice. Okay. What? Why are you screaming? You're so loud! It's so early! What's the matter? I was awake, I was just collecting my thoughts. Somebody was collecting her thoughts without us knowing. Huh? Who? She sent me this. Looks like she recorded us when we were drunk. My dear sisters, I'm apologizing right off the bat for what I am about to tell you. And if we ever cross paths again, I'm sure you'll either pretend I don't exist or slap me across the face. But I know, you will understand me. Even before we began with our project, I had been carrying a child in my womb. But that did not stop me from pursuing my dream of becoming like you. I told myself, I will never fail you. And so I had planned to get rid of it before the presscon. I also planned to break up with my boyfriend; I thought maybe he would get in the way of my career. Besides, I was getting sick of him asking my opinion on everything, until I realized that's actually a good thing. I also remembered my friends and relatives at the foundation when Miss Ness made me do some video greetings. There are people who are relying on me But don't worry. When I get back, I'll have a surprise for all of you. Of course, you will love it. I know you've been working so hard. Hello, Maja. Have you eaten? But when I was about to drink the medicine, I heard Miss Osang talking with her daughter and granddaughter so it occurred to me that I hope I could finish school, study and graduate. I think it would be nice to have something to be proud of, not just to everyone but also to myself… just like you sister Ara. But it got me thinking, I'm on the right path. Like I was saying, I want to become like you, but maybe I could skip through most of it, because you've paved the way for me, and my eyes are set on my destination. I know you won't appreciate losing your investment, and you might not think all our hardwork will have been wasted, but if I'm going to be honest, I think you've made a great success out of me. You taught me how to conduct myself, to be a living dream to aspire to. And more importantly, you taught me how to go after my own dreams. Hold on! Note: For the Mommy Note: For the Baby There she is. She got it. - She's seen it? - Yes. - Hey. - She got the cheque. I'm telling you, Ara. You better pay me back. - Yeah, yeah, I'll pay. - Look at you. What are you moaning about? We got to help her. What do we do now? Where are we supposed to find a new pornstar to train? - Exactly! - What do you mean "where"? They will come to us! Ahh, you mean we'll be holding auditions? - Yes! - Oh, I like the sound of that! Right? The search for the next Philippine Pornstar! Pretty grand, yeah? - I like that. - But gosh, She's still skinny, huh? - Even with a big tummy. - Yeah. If she ate all that iced candy, she'll blow up like a balloon. Are you sure?
