The darkness started three years ago and ﻿the sunshine has gone from part of the world. To avoid illegal migrations, ﻿fences are everywhere. Lots of diseases have spread to many people. ﻿But one is especially important for the officers. Ali is arrested for murdering his friend, Saman. He is taken back by the police to ﻿reconstruct the murder scene. Invasion A Film By ﻿Shahram Mokri Hamid! Hamid! - ﻿What? - ﻿Remove his cuffs! - ﻿What? - ﻿Come! Stay here. What are you saying? Remove his cuffs. It isn't proper. - You sure? ﻿- Yes! Where can he go? - What does he say? ﻿- Same nonsense. He's happy he reported it. ﻿I checked this route. Saman would come from that side ﻿whenever he had a suitcase. They let him bring his car in. ﻿The day he saw this boy, He was pulling the suitcase ﻿in the same place. Why the favour? He was The Emperor, did anything he wanted. - What was in the suitcase? ﻿- Saman's body, right? - No! I mean the other times. ﻿- I don't know. Why you didn't ask Saman ﻿what was in the suitcase? He did whatever he liked. Why? ﻿What's your job here? - His father was old-timer military. ﻿- Well? - People were awed by him. ﻿- Why you didn't tell him anything? What could I say ﻿when nobody said anything? How far from here to the barrier? You mean he killed the guy, ﻿took the body over the barrier, And returned the empty suitcase? He asked how far it is. ﻿No need for analysis! By car about 20 km. There is a guard at the third junction too. Did you notice any illness in the boy? - Illness? ﻿- What illness? They weren't ill. ﻿I'm making a report on them. I watch them closely. You gave a report this week too? Because of what had happened, ﻿I don't think so. - Did you or not? ﻿- I did every week, but not this week. Mahmood! ﻿Come here. Yes, sir? Where did you see ZK-10 notes? - ﻿In the city? - City? Am I the mayor you're asking me? ﻿The city is not my concern. Where did you see them? They are everywhere, ﻿in the mess, changing room, at the door. - You weren't in Saman's team? ﻿- I am. - Why you aren't with them? ﻿- I'll go now, ﻿I'm getting changed. Go on! ﻿Take him to get changed. Tho changing room? ﻿Come! Go to your locker. - Which is it? ﻿- It's in the back. - I put it in A3. ﻿- OK, A3! - Can I use the toilet? ﻿- Now? - I don't know how long it'll take. ﻿- What? - Your job. ﻿- Until they are satisfied. They might repeat it 100 times. - Where is the toilet? ﻿- End of the corridor on the right. OK, let's go. Come on! ﻿Why are you standing? What's going on? ﻿Come out! How many times you flush? - A habit! ﻿- A bad habit! You waste water and keep us waiting. - Did you wash your hands? ﻿- I didn't touch anything. Why there isn't ﻿enough disinfectant here? There is enough, ﻿and there is steam. It is a pollutant. ﻿It doesn't disinfect. It's very dirty here. My back aches. I am sleepy. ﻿I'm tired. I'm tired of the cops ﻿on the repetition of this game! They say they might repeat it 1000 times. I do everything it'll be the last time. Reconstructing the crime scene is like a child's game, But I'll reconstruct the murder scene and then it'll be over. I'll get rid of this torment. I'll tell them all I killed Saman, I'll say I wanted to save my life, everybody's life. I'll say I did it. ﻿Me myself, all alone. Well! I think you all know ﻿what we're going to do. So, listen well! Tell us whatever you know ﻿and is different from what Ali says. I know Ali is your friend. ﻿But three people have died here. Come here! Ali says Saman killed two people ﻿and then attacked him. We're not saying Ali is lying. We just want to know ﻿what happened exactly. If Ali killed Saman, ﻿where is his body? If the body is beyond the barrier, ﻿how he took it there? And if Saman killed two of your friends, ﻿Why nobody has told us anything yet? Except him! So it'll be good for your friend ﻿if everything is revealed. If you do exactly what I say, It'll be good for your friend ﻿more than anybody else. - Is that clear? ﻿- Yes! - Is it? ﻿- Yes! - Where did you start? ﻿- From the practice. - How you usually start? ﻿- They stand in a circle. - Do it. - ﻿Make a circle! You're not in this group. ﻿Go there! We just want Saman's team. They just want to know ﻿if Saman was ill. Whatever they do is phoney. ﻿Don't fear! ﻿I'll go to her. Look at Saman's photo. - It that right? Sure? ﻿- Yes. So, you all confirm ﻿he was the victim. - ﻿And your other friend, right? - Yes! - Is this right? - Yeah! - Shall I show more photos? ﻿- No! So we have the right person here. Come here. - What happened on Tuesday? ﻿- It was like other days. - What time did you see Saman? ﻿- At 9. - A.M or P.M? - A.M! Where? ﻿Which side? There. Any of you has passed ﻿third junction guard to go to the barrier? No! - Why do you scratch yourself? ﻿- Seasonal allergy. - Where do you live? ﻿- Two blocks away. - You know third junction? ﻿- Yes! - Have you ever seen the barrier? ﻿- On television. Captain, ﻿stand where he saw Saman. I stand there? - Shouldn't one of them stand there? ﻿- No, you go! - Where was he exactly? ﻿- Near the corridor. He was carrying a sports bag. You said everything must be exact. Give him a bag. - You don't need the others? ﻿- Not now. Let's go there. - When were you here? ﻿- At 8. - You'd had breakfast? ﻿- Yes! What? Sunny... Omelet and tea. - Sunny side up or omelet? ﻿- Omelet with cheese. - What cheese? - Cream. Cream cheese and omelet taste good? - Yes! ﻿- Who taught you that? Who? Why? ﻿- Answer me! ﻿- Saman! - He was a good cook? - Yes. I've heard Saman was a weirdo. ﻿Is that right? What do you mean? - Your trainer said so? - Weird how? He cooked, wore loud colors. I don't know, probably he knows. He? Not you? He likes loud colors. He must've noticed. - He dyed his hair? - No! - His hair was silver naturally? ﻿- It was his hair color. - Always? ﻿- Almost. It'd got paler lately ﻿because there isn't sunlight here. Major, we are ready. Captain! ﻿No cigarette! Stand back! Please! Where were you? ﻿Come! Come! Why are you laughing? Why? Me? ﻿I didn't! - You are laughing now. ﻿- Dunno! You must be laughing ﻿at something. - ﻿He was laughing at him. - That's right! - Why? ﻿- Because Saman doesn't look like that. - ﻿Of course I don't! - A moment! You don't understand he is playing Saman? Sorry his hair is not silver! - Continue! - We'll go on. You could bring some ﻿to play us too! To play you? Shall we take other people to some other place? And you'll do anything ﻿you want here. Stand straight! Do you want Major ﻿to put on pink pants for you? - Captain! ﻿- They like it! They'll dance for you too! ﻿Seems they liked it! - ﻿Don't insult. - ﻿Did I insult you? - ﻿Why are you dumb? - ﻿You are insulting us. Someone in pink pants ﻿is an insult to your gym? Watch your tongue! - ﻿Captain! - ﻿Go back. Come with me. You listened well, guys! - Did you see it? ﻿- Yes. Is it true? I don't know. ﻿Shahrooz is with her. - What if it is? ﻿- I don't know. What if it gets worse? Didn't you see what Borna had written? She isn't his sister, ﻿or he'd tell me. Stand back! Everything's OK. - You have tattoos? ﻿- Yes! - You do? ﻿- Yes! Why? Everybody in Saman's team has it. ﻿We all do. - Pull it up. ﻿- Up or down? Show me! Damn you, Saman! ﻿Damn you and whatever is related to you! Right when you aren't here ﻿someone pops up in your place. Someone like you. Hello? Maybe thirstier than you. Hello? You didn't have a sister, did you? Can you hear me? What have we to do with your twin now? The girl who comes with Captain ﻿is Saman's twin. She's just come ﻿from the other side. Everybody tries to escape ﻿from this darkness to that side, But she comes here. Why? Because of what we are doing. ﻿We've arranged it. Hello? Speaking. Something's happened? Oh My! It shouldn't have happened. ﻿I'd changed it this morning. I'm really sorry. Open the drawer. There is a urine bag in it. Did you find it? ﻿Just plug in the tube. Put the bag on the table. I'll take it tonight. No problem. OK! Not on the table. ﻿Wherever you wish. I'm really sorry. It shouldn't happened. Thank you. Bye. Rascal! ﻿He had a twin? - We didn't know! - Who had a sister? - Why you must know? ﻿- He's one of my player. - How many siblings this one has? ﻿- How is that related? What was I saying ﻿before the call? Why should someone come ﻿from the other side to this darkness? For anything! - ﻿What was I saying? - ﻿Major, we are ready. The girl is here now. Stand back! Please. She's standing where Saman ﻿was standing that day. She is coming to me. Come! Just like he did. They want today to be the same day, ﻿the last day. Focus! The guys had gathered that day. Come here, guys. They were talking when Saman came. Concentrate! ﻿Today is that day. - ﻿Now this girl is coming. - ﻿Daniel is in it. My head is throbbing, ﻿she is getting close, it is getting warm. - He is Daniel. ﻿- He isn't. I feel the draught. I sweat between my shoulder blades, ﻿Like every time Saman got close. I'm disturbed to repeat that day, By this girl who looks too much like Saman. Hello! Come here, guys. Gather around, guys. Hello... Saman! - What were you watching? ﻿- I wasn't. - Your shoelace is undone. ﻿- Yes! My mum is ill. - She tied it for you? ﻿- Somehow. What are you going to do? - ﻿Will you do it for me? - I'm talking about ﻿your mother. What will you do with her? Everybody is sick now. ﻿She is in bed. She loves me, ﻿or she wouldn't tie my shoe. All parents love their children. Put it in your bag. There is only one. Who gave it? - Saman, the guys can't go on. ﻿- I'll turn myself in. I didn't mean that. ﻿That's not the way. I won't mention your names. It isn't about our names! They don't treat anybody. ﻿They'll only hurt you. So what? ﻿What are you afraid of? I'm worried for you, ﻿worried for us. Didn't you see ﻿what's happened to Daniel? So, I must go! OK! I'll go and when we are an army, ﻿I'll return. I didn't say that, Saman. Daniel was a fool. ﻿But these guys want to help you. - We must think of something else. ﻿- What? Come and see. C'mon! As he puts it, "Is it clear?" You have your mobile? - ﻿You got it? - ﻿It's coming. Saman, are you here? Did you see the film? My eyes aren't used to seeing blood. ﻿Ha-ha! They'll get used to it soon. - Did you see the film? ﻿- Not completely. My eyes aren't used to ﻿seeing blood. They'll get used to it. Have you seen ﻿how much blood a man has? When they slit his throat. ﻿a sea of blood gushes out. Everybody has a lot of blood ﻿in his body. Real! ﻿Not like the films. - Watch it! ﻿- No need. The guys are frightened. I have a feeling you like me. You do! Don't worry, ﻿I'll find a way. Javad? Javad? - You OK? ﻿- I'm thirsty. - ﻿That much? - ﻿I'm very thirsty! - The third junction is very far? ﻿- Yes, very far. What was written on the paper ﻿in the locker? WE'D PROMISED TO DIE TOR HIM. THE OTHERS MIGHT'VE FORGOTTEN, ﻿BUT I'M READY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT OTHERS, ﻿ONLY ME! ﻿TELL HIM ONLY THAT. - Read it to me. ﻿- I've memorized it. - Your handwriting? ﻿- No! - Isn't it Saman's handwriting? ﻿- No, the guys wrote it. - Who? ﻿- Sadeq. - Where is the original? ﻿- It is the original. I don't mean this paper, ﻿I mean the one you copied it from. Don't you have a sample of ﻿Saman's handwriting? They don't know ﻿what's going on in the guy's head. The guys are frightened. They are frightened, Saman's sister might be like Saman. They say they want to get rid of her. Of course I don't want ﻿to be in this game. Saman was enough for me. He says... - Hello! ﻿- Hello! He told me to practice, ﻿I said I don't know how. - ﻿I'll drink water. - ﻿Wait! No need to know, you'll throw a few rings. They must run back and forth ﻿at various speeds. It'll take ﻿more than half an hour. Excuse me, major. ﻿What use is it to us? Come with me. ﻿You too! Saman hadn't told me ﻿he had a sister. And such a lady! But he'd told me ﻿you met every Tuesday. He was the team captain, ﻿It was just a meeting, not a date. - I put it in Sadeq's locker. ﻿- Saman was enough for me. I won't do it again. ﻿You take care of the girl. We have to, ﻿we won't have a better chance. If we dally, ﻿she will come to each of us. She'll become like Saman. We aren't sure. ﻿Maybe she isn't one. She said she is, it's right. They'll never find out you did it. ﻿They'll think she just left. Listen, everybody. ﻿Come here, please. We'll start after your match. ﻿From when Ali finds Kambiz's body. Suppose you've finished practice. ﻿Stand in your place. - Where should I stand? ﻿- Where should she stand? - In Saman's role? ﻿- Who else? Saman said he'd go drink water ﻿before the end of the practice. I got worried ﻿and went after him. - Why were you worried? - Saman usually didn't drink water. So, I'm not here. Saman wasn't here ﻿when I found Kambiz. - I can go? ﻿- For now. There was someone else ﻿in Changing Room 2. - Who was he? ﻿- Sadeq. Find a Sadeq for me. We need a Sadeq. There's someone in the changing room. - Shall I call him? ﻿- Yes, find him. - Where is the drinking fountain? ﻿- This way. Come, everybody. - Got a light? ﻿- No cigarette, captain! What's happened to your leg? Long version or the short one? The long one. I was running after a cat ﻿on the staircase and I fell down. - That's all. - Really? So you don't want to say. You'd gone to your ex again? I never wanted to step in that house, ﻿but I had to take my stuff. I don't want anything ﻿from me there. That jerk watches my television, ﻿stabs out his cigarette in my ashtray. He'd hung his pajamas ﻿in my wardrobe. - Why are you here? ﻿- We are waiting for Sadeq. He calls Samuel "Kitty"! I asked my ex, "Who is Kitty? ﻿Samuel has a name." She says he is an animal ﻿and doesn't understand. "Let him call it anything he wants." ﻿Is she right? I told her, "He is an animal ﻿and doesn't understand, ﻿but I do." - So do you. ﻿- Yes, I do. I meant my wife. I had a good mind ﻿to bring her here. Bring your wife here? Look at the trainer. Always scratching his forehead! ﻿Makes me puke! I brought him. - I will play the late Sadeq. ﻿- OK, go to the changing room. - Number 1 or 2? - Number 2! I was there right now. Go again. ﻿We'll join you now. - Hello. - Hello. Why is he like that? Why are you like that? I had him made up ﻿for the crime scene. You are Kambiz, right? No, I am Pedram. ﻿I'm playing Kambiz. OK, lie there. - ﻿It is dirty. - ﻿As if you are clean! ﻿Go! - Right there? - Yeah! - Put something under his head. - Put something under... - He can put his head on my lap. ﻿- Who were you? - Show your ID. ﻿- No need for that, ﻿sit there! Just sit! - We're ready. - OK! Sir, I must dramatize dying? It isn't a slasher film! ﻿You are already dead! Just lie down! - He was like this? ﻿- Yes. Suppose nobody is here. Do what you did that day. Stand back. Stand back, please. Look! I want to say Saman killed Kambiz here that day. Don't act stupid! - ﻿Did he say something? - ﻿I couldn't hear well. - Then I went to Changing Room 2. ﻿- Why? I thought Saman was there. - ﻿Everybody to Changing Room 2. - ﻿Wait! ﻿Why everybody? It is hard to gather them all again. - ﻿So? - Let's take a few with us. OK, but no crowd around me. You, you, and you. - You weren't hurt? ﻿- Because of Saman? He was your brother ﻿and dear to you. - I meant the darkness. ﻿- No, I'm used to it. How come? Have you heard about ﻿Refugees Support Camp? Those who say, ﻿"No barrier, everybody must be free ﻿to choose where to live?" Exactly. What we do is illegal, ﻿so we come here only at night. That's why I'm used to it. So, you are on the other side ﻿and this side too? Yes! Everything seems in a mess here. Could be bearable ﻿without the disease. My mother is bedridden too. People get ill, ﻿get well, get ill again. Lots of diseases together. People must cooperate but they don't, ﻿and that's the result. - Everything's ready? ﻿- Yes. Excuse me. - We must bring the big suitcase. ﻿- Why you didn't? - Bring it. ﻿- With this leg? - ﻿Someone bring it. - ﻿I'll do it. You know the trainer? ﻿Saman didn't say anything about him? I don't remember. - Any unusual demand? ﻿- What kind of demand? Nothing! - My wife is sick too. ﻿- Pardon? - The illness we talked about. - Right! She was fine. One day she came home and said she was tired. She went to bed ﻿and never got out. It was her last sentence, "I'm tired." Her legs have been paralyzed ﻿for 1.5 years. She can't come out of bed or talk, ﻿and she is incontinent. I gave the key to a neighbor ﻿to call on her. I informed them to do something. But they say, she is malingering. She is younger than me, ﻿but she looks much older. Why am I telling you this? Yes, about the immigration. I'm looking for a way ﻿to take her to the other side. Her sister got ill ﻿six months before her. She was healthy too. She went home, slept, ﻿and didn't get up again. Her husband didn't go home ﻿until she died in bed. He didn't go home? - He'd got tired. ﻿- I understand. He's a good man. ﻿Still I meet him. There are tiny insects, ﻿Like worms, like leeches, They live in feather pillows mostly. They start sucking blood ﻿from the nape of the neck. People get weak ﻿but they don't know why. I just remembered that. Major, the suitcase. It is a bit big. Shall I bring it? No, I'll come. This way, please. Well! Open it! How did you put him there? Head on one side, ﻿knees folded on his chest, And his arms under his legs. We always did it when we were kids. What? We'd both go in there ﻿to hide from our parents. - It is like TARDIS. ﻿- What? - Want me to show you? ﻿- Never mind. - ﻿Wait! Is it hard? ﻿- Not at all. OK, open it. Take it to Changing Room 2. Please, disperse. ﻿The show is over. - How far did you drag him? ﻿- To Saman's car. - So, Saman must be there too. ﻿- Yes. - Will you... ﻿- Can I have a word with you? I think you made a mistake ﻿you gave the key to your neighbor. This way you could prolong this show ﻿as long as you wanted. Just like your brother-in-law. - Can I go too? ﻿- Yes, we'll come after you. - Won't you come to finish it? ﻿- Right away. Wait! You could have them ﻿in the practice? No, but Saman ﻿had got the permission for me. I must tell them I found Saman ﻿in the changing room that day. And Saman was sitting on Sadeq's body, ﻿and I was shocked to see him. Give a hand instead of watching! I must say, I helped Saman hide the body. And how I stabbed him afterwards ﻿and dumped his body into the suitcase. The more I resist, ﻿the worse it'll get. If I don't have anything, ﻿my body will show a worse reaction. Then I can't choose. ﻿Nobody will be safe around me. You decided not to turn me in, ﻿but you've all abandoned me now. I must look after myself. What was the rest? Or even you will not be safe either. I must look after myself ﻿or even you will not be safe either. Sadeq was your choice? I should've chosen you? Look what the one you have chosen, ﻿has written for you. Ali! Stop! Just Stop! - What happened? ﻿- Stabbed her. In the heart? Don't let anybody into the room ﻿for 2 minutes. Hurry! Why I didn't talk to her? The girl will burn to smoke now, ﻿As if she never existed. I'm growing wings. Right between my shoulder blades. Feather is growing ﻿where there is always sweat. Why Saman never said ﻿he had a sister? What's going on? ﻿Come out! How many times you flush? - A habit. ﻿- A bad habit! You waste water ﻿and keep us waiting. - Did you wash your hands? ﻿- I didn't touch anything. Why there isn't ﻿enough disinfectant here? There is enough. ﻿And there is steam. It is a pollutant. ﻿It doesn't disinfect. It's very dirty here. Even if they make it 1000 times. ﻿I'll say the same. That's how I stabbed Saman. I went to the changing room. ﻿I stabbed him in the heart. I'll say the same 1000 times. Saman killed Kambiz and Sadeq ﻿for blood. And I stabbed him ﻿in the changing room. Saman killed Kambiz and Sadeq ﻿for blood. And I stabbed him ﻿in the changing room. Saman killed Kambiz and Sadeq ﻿for blood. And I stabbed him ﻿in the changing room. Be quiet! I think you all know ﻿what we're going to do. So, listen well. Tell us whatever you know ﻿and is different from what Ehsan says. I know Ehsan is your friend, ﻿but three people have died here. Come here! Ehsan says Saman killed two people ﻿and then attacked him. We're not saying Ehsan is lying. We just want to know ﻿what happened exactly. If Ehsan killed Saman, ﻿where is his body? If the body is beyond the barrier, ﻿how he took it there? And if Saman killed two of your friends ﻿why nobody has told us anything yet? Except him! So it'll be good for your friend ﻿if everything is revealed. If you do exactly what I say, It'll be good for your friend ﻿moro than anybody else. - Is that clear? ﻿- Yes. - Is it? ﻿- Yes! - Where did you start? ﻿- From the practice. - How you usually start? ﻿- They stand in a circle. - Do it. - Make a circle! You're not in this group. ﻿Go there. They just want to know ﻿if Saman was ill. Whatever they do is phoney. ﻿Don't fear, ﻿I'll go to her. Look at Saman's photo. - ﻿It that right? - Yes! So, you all confirm he was the victim. - ﻿﻿And your other friend, right? - ﻿Yes! - Is that right? - Yeah! - Shall I show more photos? ﻿- No! So we have the right person here. Come here! Please give us a hand. - What happened on Tuesday? ﻿- It was like the other days. - When did you see Saman? ﻿- At 9. - ﻿A.M or P.M? - A.M! Where? ﻿Which side? Negar! ﻿How do I know her name? It is written here she must die. We must kill her, ﻿because she is ill. ﻿Because she is his sister. - Hello! ﻿- Hello... Ali. - Saman told you my name? ﻿- No, I know it. - ﻿Why do you whisper? - ﻿Where from? Ehsan, Mohammad, Pezhman, ﻿Jamshid and Rahim. - ﻿Where should I put it? - ﻿Why did you bother? Here, there, makes no difference. I'll put it here. - Its leg is broken. ﻿- Its leg? Its wheel. ﻿Here. - ﻿I'll bring the bigger one. - ﻿That is heavy. ﻿I'll bring it. I'll get help. Is it true you are Saman's sister? - Saman talked a lot about you. ﻿- About me? About all of you! The way you helped him, ﻿and then you didn't. You look so much like Saman. - I've come here before. ﻿- When? Always! Whenever you saw Saman ﻿with the red suitcase, I was in it. You weren't on the other side? Inside of the suitcase ﻿is somehow the other side. - Were you or not? ﻿- No, I wasn't. One of us was always in the suitcase, ﻿one out of it. We fooled everybody, ﻿even my parents. They still think ﻿I was on the other side. We built our own sides ﻿in the suitcase. They didn't find out? I am a Scarlet Witch ﻿in my own right. You didn't find out either. But why? Remember the day ﻿Saman did magic? He went into the suitcase ﻿and came out on the other side of the gym. You were all dumbfounded. I was behind the seats. - ﻿I asked why. - ﻿Why what? ﻿Why I didn't go? You really think there is a difference ﻿between this and that side? All will be similar in two years, ﻿more similar than Saman and me. In a way nobody will find out ﻿which is this or that side. You can't have legs ﻿on both sides of the barrier. The barrier gets wider in some parts. ﻿You'd heard that, hadn't you? - Saman always said it. ﻿- I said it, not Saman. And many times you poured out ﻿your heart to me, not to Saman. Glue for the suitcase leg. Hold it for two minutes. - What did I tell you? ﻿- Good things. For example? The day you told Saman ﻿you liked his style. You liked My style. I don't understand you. "It is late, it is late. ﻿Into the well, the sun went. The sun of the lover's soul, ﻿into seclusion with God, it went. A day is hidden in the night..." I preferred not to tell these to Saman. - I told them to Saman ﻿- They sounded prettier in my ear. The one you loved was me. What do you want here? I know you are his sister. These guys gave blood twice a week. How long they could go on? A bottle of blood ﻿twice a week is a lot. Why did you accept in the first place? Could we refuse? ﻿We wanted it too. It is hard to explain, ﻿Saman was everything to us. You don't know what was between Saman and us. - ﻿Suppose I do know. - ﻿Never mind that! One day Saman said two bottles. ﻿It got harder. Now you are making it even harder. He wanted one for me. Don't worry, I was joking. Tell me! Aren't you afraid ﻿I might give you away? I can tell them you had a ZK-10 case ﻿and hid him for so long. This crime is 10 times grater ﻿than killing Saman. Nobody knows what this disease is ﻿and why the agents take them away. We were afraid it might be ﻿worse than anything else for him. Lately, we had to go ﻿to other people for blood. Saman wanted an army, ﻿it was impossible. The guys were hesitant ﻿to turn in Saman. That's why we took the dagger. Just in case, till that day. Then we decided someone must say ﻿he dumped the body over the barrier. So they wouldn't look for his body. If you're here to find out what happened to Saman, that was all. I have your painting. ﻿I've brought it. Saman gave it to you. This wheel is for Saman too. ﻿I remember. Ali! I can take you in the suitcase. ﻿I've lived in it a lifetime. Come here! He is here, in the storeroom. Sir? If the store-keeper said something. ﻿I haven't told him anything. - What for example? - I don't know! He's brought a boy ﻿to send him to the other side. - What is it to you? ﻿- Nothing to do with me. - Who is he? ﻿- The one who sells antiques. You buy from him too. ﻿I'll be behind the door. Here he is. Look at this. ﻿A doll! - He brought it? ﻿- Wait a second. The model is here, ﻿I want to sell it. The main hall, ﻿the corridor you passed through, And your friends are back here. We are here now. ﻿It was to be a boiler room. A door here and a corridor in the back. Let me show you something else. What is was going to be ﻿and what it is now! The main cylinder ﻿of the boiler room. Look what happens when I put it here. Interesting? ﻿Will you buy it? Eskandar brought it - He brought my dagger too? ﻿- Yes! Eskandar! - Hello. ﻿- Hello. You brought it? Here. ﻿This is what you want. Stab someone and his heart will go aflame in two minutes. He is strong or not? Whatever! It destroys him. He'll turn to smoke, ﻿as if he's never existed. Nobody can pull it out. ﻿You want to use it? - I don't know! ﻿- Whoever! Only the one who's stabbed ﻿can pull it out. Only him! When you pull it out, the heart will work like the first day. - Got it? ﻿- Yes. - You will tell him or I do it? ﻿- Whatever you say. - ﻿Give us a minute. - ﻿I'm in a hurry. - I can tell him. ﻿- No, go! It is sharp. - Look! - ﻿Thanks! This boy wants to leave. He says his life is in danger, ﻿and his body is like a blood bag. A smuggler gets money ﻿and takes him inside the barrier. They get rid of the passport, And take him to the other side ﻿with a new name. It'll be over on the other side. He'll mingle with others ﻿and nobody finds out, Where he has come from. He'd better go, ﻿but nobody has left so far. Tell him not to go. I will, ﻿but he won't listen. Ferry Mercury isn't around ﻿so I thought you talk to him. Who is Ferry? The sissy in pink pants, Saman! He listened to him. Now he wants to ask you ﻿to take him. How? He says you can. ﻿What is the story of the suitcase? Which suitcase? Fire the suitcase for him. I don't have a suitcase ﻿to fire for anybody! Thank you for this! Bye for now. I didn't tell anybody ﻿about going in the suitcase. OK! Look! Sadeq is in Changing Room 2. ﻿Give it to him to put in his locker. Hurry! Nagar said ﻿Saman wanted the extra share for her. That is the game. We'll play and say ﻿how we killed Saman. And then ﻿we'll kill Negar, In place of Saman. We kill Negar ﻿and the stupid agents think she has left? Everything is that easy? I put it in Sadeq's locker. Saman was enough for me. ﻿I won't do it again. - You take care of the girl. ﻿- We have to. We won't have a better chance. If we dally, ﻿she will come to each of us. - She'll become Saman. - But we don't know she is... She said she is! ﻿Definitely! Don't worry, ﻿they'll never find out you did it. They'll think she just left. I must run a lot. I must write on the paper ﻿whatever I want in life. If I find some paper and a pen I'll write I want to be fit again, To learn rock-climbing, ﻿to leave. To find out what's in her mind. She is lying. It isn't the painting ﻿I drew for Saman. I didn't kill Negar. I didn't kill Saman. I'd write on the paper, I'm concentrating to be able ﻿to set fire to everything by looking at it. I'd write who I want to be. I'd write ﻿Saman is still alive. I'd write, I want Saman to be alive. Ali! Saman? Negar told you I wanted the extra blood for her? I talked to her. You were stumped! ﻿Wasn't my voice like his? Weren't you in that? I'm tired of this foolish game. It was better than the suitcase trick, wasn't it? - You are always tricking. ﻿- What trick? That box is really magic. If you know and get into it, ﻿you'll be anywhere you want in a jiffy. On the other side of the world, ﻿another planet, anywhere. Why are you coming after me? I'm not! ﻿I'll use the toilet in the back. - ﻿You'll go that way? - ﻿I'm not going anywhere in particular. I just came here. Let's go. ﻿We'll separate at the flag. Any idea why they call this game "ITIN"? No! Itinerary of life! ﻿ITIN! It is that way for me. Because if you can drop the ring ﻿around the pole at 40 meters, You must have ﻿a lifetime experience. For example, ﻿we are at the beginning of our life. Isn't it good ﻿we can see its end from here? - Where is the end? ﻿- The flag. - So we are still in the good part. - ﻿Yes, we don't hate each other yet. It is good for the first two years. Right? You think I'll live only 32 years? If you go to prison for murder, I was right about 32 years. Might be better this way, Rather than living together ﻿all our life, as far as the flag. Let's give a lofty goal on this foolish game. You asked why I am here. For this! You'd seen them before? ﻿I made them. They are narrower ﻿but hold three liters each. Interesting, right? I must do it all my life? You always did it for Saman. ﻿Do it for me now. But you say, ﻿I always did it for you. I do, ﻿I liked to think that way. You wanted to give it to Saman ﻿to hear, But you gave it to me. I listened to it zillion times. ﻿It is cooler each time. I never gave it to him. I doubt you've told them to Saman. Keep it! Maybe you should've given it to Saman. Most probably ﻿that's what you prefer. Will you give it to me? You see? ﻿We are separating at old age. Sir, I brought him. - I'll play the late Sadeq. ﻿- Go to the changing room. - Number 1 or 2? ﻿- Number 2. I was there just now. Go again! ﻿We'll join you now. - Hello, sir. ﻿- Hello. What is it? ﻿Why is he like that? I had him made up ﻿for the crime scene. You are Kambiz, right? No, I am Pedram. ﻿I'm playing Kambiz. OK, lie there. - ﻿It is dirty. - ﻿As if you are clean! ﻿Go! - Is there right? - Yes! - ﻿﻿Put something under his head! - Put something... - He can put his head on my lap. ﻿- Who were you? - Show your ID. ﻿- No need. Just sit there! We're ready. I must dramatize dying? It isn't a slasher film! You are already dead! Lie down! - He was like this? ﻿- Yes. Suppose nobody is here. ﻿Do what you did that day. Stand back! Don't act stupid! - Did he say something? ﻿- I couldn't hear well. - Then I went to Changing Room 2. ﻿- Why? I thought Saman was there. - ﻿Everybody to Changing Room 2. - ﻿Wait! ﻿Why everybody? It is hard to gather them all again. ﻿Let's take a few with us. OK, but no crowd around me. You, you and you. Gut up, artist! ﻿Changing Room 2. Stupid! Give a hand instead of watching! The more I resist, ﻿the worse it'll get. If I don't have anything, ﻿my body will show a worse reaction. Then I can't choose. ﻿Nobody will be safe around me. They are all in my mind. The fire is in my brain. Negar is in my brain. The painting in my mind ﻿is still intact, not burnt. I want to start running again. I want Saman to be alive ﻿and tell me his sister is lying. I want my wings to grow soon, ﻿to learn rock-climbing, To wear sunglasses. I want to know ﻿who I have poured out my heart to. I don't want Negar to exist, ﻿or even Saman. I write these to remember them. To remember ﻿I've killed two for Saman's sake. Two people who shadow me. Wait! What happened? In the heart? Don't let anybody into ﻿the room for two minutes. Hurry! I wish I had another chance. ﻿A now role, only once. Are you fine? My wings are growing. I wish I'd written, ﻿I want to be a strong bird. I want to stare at the agent in ﻿the changing room and set him on fire. - ﻿I put it in A4. - ﻿OK, A4. What are you writing to them? I don't like what you do. Don't imitate Saman. ﻿Talk like yourself. She imitated me? - ﻿Why did you come here? - ﻿What did you write to them? - Can I use the toilet? ﻿- Now? - I don't know how long it'll take. ﻿- What? Your job. I wrote not to tell anything ﻿about giving blood to you. The agents know about your case. ﻿They are looking for evidence. Did you tell them not to hurt Negar? Why should I? I promised you, not Negar. Negar and I are not different. ﻿You don't get it? Any idea about my situation? Everybody passes you by ﻿and you can be where you are forever. Look at this! You couldn't even imagine it. I want to grow a mustache. ﻿You think it'll look good on me? Some people call me ﻿Freddie Mercury. - ﻿I think you'll be ugly. - Why the long face? - ﻿You didn't tell me about her. - ﻿I'd told nobody. - ﻿Why you brought her here? - ﻿She came, she has things to do. A lofty goal! Why you didn't tell me ﻿they were for two people? - ﻿What's the matter with you today? - What else I don't know? Sit down! - What I don't know? - ﻿Sit! Close your eyes. "You aren't like me, ﻿I'm not like you. You aren't what I am, ﻿I'm not what you are. I am in your command, ﻿you are in my blood. The moon and the sun if I become, ﻿I am still lower than what you are." Ali! Ali! ﻿Are you there? - ﻿Yes! - ﻿Give a hand. Bring the glue too. We must take a suitcase together. We must tell her, we know why she is here. - ﻿Do we know why she is here? - We don't? You don't? Glue... for tho suitcase leg. Hold it for two minutes. - He will never tell her anything. ﻿- Why? Come and see. ﻿He's all thumbs. He's in love again. I'll warn her when you go to the other side. And you'll follow me up. What is it? It is hers. ﻿Came directly from there. I'll start and you continue. ﻿The guys are there too. I know you are his sister. Ali! ﻿Come here! These guys gave blood twice a week. ﻿How long they could go on? A bottle of blood twice a week is a lot. How many times you glue it? It won't work this way. Even if you collect all the glue ﻿in the world in your storeroom, They will run out one day. You've always trusted the wrong people. It got harder, now you are making it even harder. He wanted one for me. Don't worry! I was joking. Ali! ﻿Come here! Aren't you afraid I might give you away? I can tell them you had a ZK-10 case ﻿and hid him for so long. This crime is 10 times grater ﻿than killing Saman. Saman? - ﻿Saman? - ﻿I'm here. Come here, I want to show you something. - They are your followers? ﻿- Kambiz and Sadeq. Javad. Mop around the drinking fountain ﻿in a few minutes. - Sure, sir. ﻿- Completely clean! So, they are your followers. Increase their number. ﻿The more, the better. Look! It says the color of the pupils change. Fools! Probably they think that is why ﻿the color of my hair has changed. I saw one of the boys ﻿was recording me with his mobile. I asked and he said, ﻿"No, I'm checking a site." I told a few guys ﻿to catch him red-handed. He'd been filming me for four days to imitate me. To walk like me, ﻿talk like me. I both liked him ﻿and wanted to punish him. I asked him, "How should I punish you?" He says, "The way you punish yourself." I said, "Kiddie! If I punish you like I punish myself, ﻿you will be done!" He said, "No problem!" Tell me! You don't want ﻿to ask me a question? Don't you want to know ﻿what I think about future? Won't you ask ﻿what music I've listened to lately? - What did you listen? ﻿- I didn't have time! - Anything new been published? - "Potential of Love!" What is it? "Take my hand, ﻿it is the potential of love! Listen to my heart, ﻿it is the potential of love! Look at my gaze, ﻿it is the potential of love!" Funny! What does he mean by "potential of love"? You listen to such things? Take a look at this. I'll be back now. What do you think? - You are preparing an army. ﻿- I won't need an army with you. Can I go? Asking for permission? ﻿Of course you can. Guys! I owe my life to him. You can come to us any time. What is your plan ﻿with so many people and equipment? We are weak. ﻿I'll return. They kicked me out once. ﻿Naturally, I would want to go back. - Why don't you go to the other side? ﻿- That side? We had sides once. ﻿The other side was safe, ﻿this side shit! Aren't they the same now? ﻿Copy and Paste! - Is that my suitcase? ﻿- Yes. What are they doing? The inspector says ﻿everything must be like before. C'mon! ﻿They'll ruin it. Yes, Negar told me ﻿you played tricks. Negar said that? Go inside the suitcase ﻿and you'll be anywhere you want in an instant. She said, ﻿she came out in your place. And where the hell I went? ﻿I was in the suitcase, right? I don't know! Didn't I teach you ﻿how to hear sounds from a distance? How is that related? I taught you everything. ﻿Now whatever Negar says is true? - Do you know anything about it? ﻿- What is it? Haven't seen it before? You copied "Potential of Love" on it? Ali! ﻿Come with us. This is Potential of love! I wish I told them all ﻿Saman Was outside. Right in the back... ﻿nearby. That he is always here. I wish I told them all ﻿I didn't stab Saman and hid him. Saman! Negar! Negar who is getting killed ﻿and Saman who I didn't want to die. Sadeq, ﻿the paper and pen. Write: WE'D PROMISED TO DIE FOR HIM. IF THE OTHERS HAVE FORGOTTEN, ﻿I AM STILL READY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE OTHERS. ONLY ME! ﻿TELL HIM THAT. You must go too. - Back there? ﻿- Yes! Just give the locker key before you go. Saman! ﻿I'm recording this for you. I don't care, ﻿if you laugh at me. You have surely found out by now ﻿I'm ready to do anything for you. Now I want to tell you why. Give a hand ﻿instead of standing there! The more I resist, ﻿the worse it'll get. If I don't have anything, ﻿my body will show a worse reaction. Then I can't choose. ﻿Nobody will be safe around me. You decided not to turn me in, ﻿but you've all abandoned me now. I must look after myself. - ﻿What was the rest? - ﻿Or even you will not be safe either. I must look after myself ﻿or even you will not be safe either. Sadeq was your choice? I should've chosen you? Look what the one you have chosen, has written for you. I'm thinking about a few minutes ago. I see myself writing on the paper what I must be. I see myself ﻿getting a dagger in the storeroom. I see myself gluing the wheel of a suitcase. I see myself saying the changing room ﻿would be clean in two minutes. I see myself, ﻿who doesn't want Negar to die. I think about a few minutes later. Negar and I are walking ﻿on the beach. The sun is burning our skins. We catch fire. We catch fire and rise from the ashes.
