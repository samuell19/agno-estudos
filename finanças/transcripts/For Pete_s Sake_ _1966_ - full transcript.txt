SHE CAN USE ALL THE GOLD STARS SHE CAN GET. EAT! [door closes] MMM, DOESN'T THAT LOOK GOOD? LIAR! OH! I ALMOST FORGOT SOMETHING. THIS CAME IN THE MAIL THIS MORNING. WE GRADUATED! THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT MR. AND MRS. PETER HARPER HAVE COMPLETED THE LESSONS IN MY PERSONAL BIBLE STUDY CORRESPONDENCE COURSE, AND IT'S SIGNED BILLY GRAHAM! I DON'T THINK HE REALLY SIGNED IT, BUT IT'S NICE, HUH? NICE ENOUGH TO FRAME? THAT GETS US OVER ONE HURDLE. YEAH, I FIGURE THE LORD STUCK WITH US. I MARKED SOMETHING. WELL, LISTEN, I'LL READ IT IF YOU EAT. "WHOEVER LOSES HIS LIFE FOR MY SAKE SHALL FIND IT"? THAT, THAT SEEMED LIKE DOUBLE TALK AT FIRST. I TOLD THE LORD IT WAS CONFUSING. I DIDN'T GET WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT. AND THEN THIS MORNING I WAS STEWING ABOUT IT AGAIN. IT WAS LIKE THE FOG LIFTED. I, I THINK IT'S LIKE THIS. YOU'RE NOT REALLY FREE UNTIL YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST. I MEAN HONESTLY, WITHOUT ANY STRINGS ATTACHED. THEN WHEN YOU DO, THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY START LIVING. THAT'S WHERE THE LIVING IS. SO YOU GOTTA... YOU GOTTA LOSE IT TO FIND IT, HUH? YEAH. HEY, YOU WANNA BE ONE OF THEM LADY PREACHERS ON THE RADIO? [laughing] A KIND OF WILD THING HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY. I WAS, UH, WRESTLING WITH THIS TIRE, AND I SMACKED MY THUMB A LITTLE WHOMP WITH A WRENCH, AND OL' HARVEY MENTIONED THAT THE AIR DIDN'T EVEN TURN BLUE. THAT'S FUNNY, HE HAD TO TELL ME THAT.

THEN YOU EITHER TURN AROUND AND WALK AWAY AS MANY PEOPLE DO FROM THE CHURCH, OR ELSE YOU'RE DRAWN IN, STRONGER AND STRONGER AND TIGHTER AND TIGHTER. YOU SEE, CHRIST SAID THAT WE DRAW CLOSE TO HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH. NOW THAT MEANS IT HAPPENS INSIDE. HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE PHYSICAL. THIS IS A WHOLE NEW AREA OF RELATIONSHIP.

LET'S HOPE THAT'S ALL HE NEEDS. CAROL TOOK FIRST AID LAST SEMESTER. OH, WE ONLY WORKED ON DUMMIES! OH... [grunting] OH. OH, LORD, WELL, I KNOW MY BIG MOUTH GOT ME INTO THIS THING, BUT HOW 'BOUT SPRINGIN' ME, HUH? HARV, WHY'D YOU LET HIM GO? YOU KNEW HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT. OL' PETE'S LIKE THAT, SKIPPER. HE'S NOT AFRAID TO TACKLE YOUR WORLD. [faint sound of motorcycle engine] WAIT A MINUTE, HE'S STILL ON IT. HE'S STILL IN THE GAME. [cheering] ♪ JESUS CHRIST WAS THE MOST DECEITFUL LIAR THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN, OR HE WAS AN EGO-MANIAC OF MOUNT EVEREST PROPORTIONS, OR HE IS WHO HE CLAIMS TO BE. NOW THIS IS A LIFE-SIZED QUESTION THAT SOONER OR LATER, WE MUST ALL FACE UP TO. OUR RESPONSE CAN BE INTENSELY PERSONAL, CASUAL TO THE POINT OF INDIFFERENCE, FLIP, YOU NAME IT. BUT NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, WE DO DECIDE. OR OUR PREJUDICE DECIDES FOR US. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ONE OF THOSE RELIGIOUS TYPES, MAN. IT'S A LOTTA BULL ABOUT CLEANING YOURSELF UP. GOD WANTS US TO COME TO HIM AS WE ARE. AND ANYWAY, HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT YOU AND ME THAN WE DO. YOU KNOW HOW A STRING OF PEARLS BREAK AND THEY SCATTER ALL OVER AND YOU WONDER WHETHER YOU'LL EVER FIND THEM ALL AGAIN? IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT WITH GOD AND US IN A WAY. HE SEES US AS PEARLS LYING DEEP IN THE DUST OF OUR OWN DESIRES. NOW, HE CAN'T VERY WELL LOVE THE DUST WE'RE LYING IN, BUT HE NEVER STOPS LOVING THAT PEARL LYING IN THE DUST. THE PEARL IS, WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE REAL YOU. GOD SEES THE REAL YOU, BUT BECAUSE HE CAN PENETRATE THE SURFACE OF LIFE, HE ALSO SEES THE POTENTIAL YOU, WHAT YOU CAN BECOME WITH CHRIST IN YOUR LIFE. YOU WALK WITH A MINISTER, YOU SHOULD EXPECT A SERMON. I'LL SEE YOU ALL LATER. (girls) BYE-BYE. HE'S ALL RIGHT. YEAH. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T DOUBT. YOU CAN BRING YOUR DOUBTS RIGHT ALONG WITH YOU. RIGHT UP TO THE CROSS. THE BIBLE TELLS US ABOUT A MAN WHO LOOKED JESUS RIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAID, "I BELIEVE." AND THEN IN HIS VERY NEXT BREATH SAID, "HELP ME WITH MY UNBELIEF." DAD, UNCLE LEO'S BACK THERE. (minister) THE LORD LIKES THAT KIND OF HONESTY. UNCLE LEO'S BACK THERE. AND DON'T FIGURE THAT HE'S GONNA PUT THESE DOUBTS IN SOME COMPARTMENT MARKED "UNFINISHED BUSINESS." HE WON'T SIDESTEP THEM, AND YOU WON'T EITHER. BECAUSE AS YOU LEARN TO LIVE WITH CHRIST ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS, YOU FIND YOURSELF GRAPPLING WITH THEM ONE BY ONE, UNTIL YOU COME TO A DAY WHEN YOU SAY, "NOW I KNOW." NOBODY CAN EVER TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU, BECAUSE IT'LL BE REAL, RIGHT DOWN HERE WHERE YOU LIVE. AND A THOUSAND MEANINGFUL MOMENTS WILL ADD UP TO ONE ALL-ENCOMPASSING FACT-- YOU WILL KNOW HIM. YOU CAN TURN YOUR FACE TO CHRIST OR GIVE HIM YOUR BACK. WHICH WILL IT BE? HEY, LEO! LEO, WAIT UP. [laughing] AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE INSIDE? HEY, LEO... WHAT'S SO FUNNY? YOU PRAYED ME IN THERE, DIDN'T YOU? [laughing] WELL, I'M JUST LOOKIN', SEE? NO, PROMISES. [laughing] NO GUARANTEES. NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND, BOY SCOUT? I'M JUST GONNA LISTEN AROUND THE EDGES. HEY, MAN, LISTEN, I OWE YOU A BIG PUNCH IN THE MOUTH. YOU WANT IT NOW? HUH? YOU WANT IT NOW? WE MAY ROCK YOUR SACRED INSTITUTION. HOW 'BOUT THAT, ARNIE?
