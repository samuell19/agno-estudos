I had a dream about my childhood. I'd forgotten about it for a long time. I couldn't remember it for a long time. A dream of the distant past... I'm Azaka Kokutou. I'm a 16-year old apprentice magus. Mikiya Kokutou is my older brother and... Touko Aozaki is my mentor. Ryougi Shiki is my rival in love. You could call me an angst-ridden maiden. Let me add a note to avoid any misunderstanding. My angst is not the result of being in love with my brother. I care about him so much, I don't even believe it myself. I had my uncle adopt me as his daughter. I entered a boarding school called Reien. I live away so he can forget about me as his little sister. So, there is only one problem I have now. That girl who came out of nowhere and stole my target! Brother, I... AM... HOME! Welcome home, Azaka. Hey! Oh, yeah. You've never met. Let me introduce you to her. She's my classmate, Shiki Ryougi. I must separate those two as soon as possible! I must keep Mikiya safe from danger! To achieve these goals and to match her mentally and physically as a rival, I even became an apprentice to a magus. It's a story about a brave and laudable girl... That's me... but... What's going on, Miss Touko? Ah! Sounds like the secret weapon has arrived safely. How is this a secret weapon?! Do you remember what I asked you to do? To find and eliminate a magus using fairies to spread anxiety among the students at the Reien Academy. That's correct. You can't see fairies, so won't you need "eyes" to find them? Well... that's... I have orders from Miss Touko Aozaki to be here. My name is Shiki Ryougi. You stupid Touko! It's off to a rocky start! Nothing bad will happen. Shiki thinks of Azaka as her little sister. You just don't get it, do you? Get what? Anything and everything. I've been thinking for a while now... ...that Touko might actually be stupid. I agree. Especially for having YOU sneak into the academy. These orders are insane! How cruel. I'm definitely the victim in this matter. I must help you find fairies during the New Year holidays. I'm sorry. Sorry, but I don't have "Mystic Eyes" like you and Miss Touko. Hey, is this your dog, Azaka? He followed me after I went to your room. No. He's Seo's, my roommate who's traveling abroad with her family. She asked me to babysit him. But he's naughty like his master, and he's a handful. Oh, really...? This school is strict, but they're okay with pets. What makes you think they're okay with it? Why did you bring him with you?! What do you mean "why"? He's been with us for a while. Take him back to the room! Hurry! This is a boarding school, so students stay here even during winter break. Please don't stand out... That's the chapel. Did you see something? Do they have Mass or something like that there? Argh! Doesn't it go something like, "Our Father who dart in Heaven"? Don't make him dart up there! Oh, I guess it's "who art in Heaven." Well, for now... We'll go talk to the homeroom teacher of Class 1-4. Is it that Hayama guy? No, Mr. Hayama suddenly disappeared last November. Rumor had it he was tied to dangerous people. He could be at the bottom of Tokyo Bay by now. How did a guy like him manage to work as a teacher? He was the chairman's younger brother. Who is the new homeroom teacher now, then? It's Mr. Kurogiri. I'm Azaka Kokutou from Class 1-1. Did you already hear from Mother? Yes. Regarding the rumor about the fairies who steal memories? Yes. Some students also asked about them. And what did you do, sir? I told them not to worry. They're just pranksters. Do you believe in them? Yes. Folk tales of fairies may be scarce in Japan, but they are popular in Europe. You're originally from Wales, right? Yes. In my country, there are many cute fairy tales involving cat fairies and dog fairies. I'm rather fond of them myself. Have you ever heard of fairies killing people? Are you referring to what happened to Kaori Tachibana? Yes. She didn't kill herself. She was attacked by fairies. That's what Class 1-4... Excuse me. Oh, Miss Ouji. Is it already time? Yes, Mr. Satsuki. It's past one o'clock, the time we agreed on. She is Misaya Ouji, president of the student body and the chairman's daughter. You are tough, Miss Ouji. Eternity is a complicated subject... I don't think Miss Tachibana's incident... ...was caused by fairies. Miss Kokutou, wasn't it? Yes, Miss Ouji. Mr. Satsuki isn't related to the matter. Please don't bother him anymore. All right. We can't talk to the students in Class 1-4 who were involved. No one wants to talk about the case. I guess we'll just have to go to others. What's the matter, Shiki? You were surprised that Mr. Kurogiri looks just like Mikiya, weren't you? Yeah. So that's why you're unusually kind around him? Wh... What's that supposed to mean? It sounds like you're suggesting something. Not really. It just came to mind. A... Anyway... His name is Satsuki Kurogiri. No matter how much he looks like him, he is not Mikiya Kokutou. It's not so much looking alike. It's more like... More like...? Shiki? What's wrong, Shiki? Time to get to work. Hey, Shiki, don't go off on your own! Come on, Shiki! Geez! Miss Azaka Kokutou. HOLY SPIRIT LANTERN Hey, Azaka. You're gonna catch a cold. Mikiya... Hey, huh, what? Punch! Ouch! What's that for, you idiot!? Didn't it wake you up? What? Azaka, do you know what time it is now? It's a little past two PM... Shiki, could it be...? Robbed by a fairy. I don't know who this magus is, but I'll beat the crap out of him! He can cry and apologize, but I'll never forgive him! This isn't it, either. What is it? You're pretty bold, Azaka. The chairman is at a New Year's party, and won't be back until tomorrow, so... Huh? This is the only locked one. Shiki? Huh? What kind of girl are you... Thank you, God! Class 1-4 Kaori Tachibana Investigation Report This is it! The interview reports of the Class 1-4 students right after the Kaori Tachibana incident. Miss Kaori Tachibana started acting strangely at the beginning of the second semester. She suddenly lost weight and looked pale. She looked as if she was always scared of something. One day, in the middle of the class... Help me! The fairies... the fairies are coming! Tachibana! Wait! Tachibana! And, after that, the old school building burned down. They made such a detailed testimony, but now they don't remember? The fairy handler magus is trying to erase the traces of the incident with Kaori Tachibana. So, Hayama is the suspicious one. He looks pale to begin with. Look at this... Hmm? Ah! Miss Touko! So... was anyone we met today suspicious, Shiki? I see. Hey, Azaka. Is it that memories stolen by the fairies never return? That's how it's supposed to be. Why are you asking now? No reason in particular. Well, people don't die from having their memories stolen. I'm a good example of that. Do you mean to say murder isn't the fairy handler's intent? It could just be working out that way. Really, if it was just about murder you wouldn't need fairies. You're right. It's true... taking memories away means... there is something that someone wants to hide or wants people to forget. Shiki, aren't you hiding something? Huh? Don't play dumb! Take out the knife you took from the dining hall. It's just an ordinary knife. You have nothing to worry about. No, because you're the kind of person who can kill a lock with a ruler! I'm collecting them just to admire them in private. So, you're not going to give it to me no matter what, eh? Don't be a nag. All right, then. I'll have to use force. Give it to me! Just give it to me, you... Got it! You've got enormous strength! Pardon me! But that should be enough to push Mikiya down. Wh... wh... what are you saying?! Nothing... I have no ulterior motive. Just a thought. So... you can tell? I don't know... I'm not the one who knew. Besides, he hasn't noticed. Isn't that good enough? I see... Why do you like someone like him so much? You guys are siblings, right? To tell you the truth, I love things that are special. Rather, I seem to be attracted to things that are taboo. I think I'm lucky to be in love with a close relative. You pervert! Don't call me that, psycho! The problem is I don't remember when I fell in love with Mikiya. I have no memories of that time. Shiki, wake up! Come on! Wake up! Remember, we're supposed to go take a look at the arson site in the old school building first thing in the morning? Argh! Wake up, stupid Shiki! Hmph! Keep sleeping forever! Miss Kokutou, are you there? Your brother is on the phone. Brother...? Well, I'm pulling myself together and starting the investigation. In November of last year, Kaori Tachibana shouted, "The fairies are coming!", ran out of the classroom and ran into this old school building. Then, she set this place on fire to kill herself. The fairy handler has taken the memory of this incident away from the students. What's the goal of the magus? Good morning, Miss Kokutou. Good morning, Miss Ouji. What a peculiar place to see you. Would you like to join me for the morning Mass? Yes. If I'm not a bother. Thank you, Miss Kokutou. It's been so long since I prayed with someone else like this. If that incident hadn't happened, that girl would still be by my side. You mean Kaori Tachibana? Yes. She was like a little sister to me. She was clumsy and got the short end of the stick, but... She was deeply religious and kind. However... I want to erase every little trace of her disgrace. So, it's you. I acquired magic for Kaori's sake. Please back off, Miss Kokutou. I don't want to fight you. But, you're the one who started it, Miss Ouji. Yes, and that helped me realize... You love your brother but you don't know why. Wh... what...?! That's fantastic. I guess you know everything. Then, I'll confess. I have no recollection of the very moment I fell in love with Mikiya. I was in love with him before I knew it. So, if you can draw out that memory for me, I might just look the other way. That's not possible. The fairies can take only the memories that you remember. No one can collect lost memories... the oblivion. Also, Miss Kokutou, you said you'd look the other way, but I have no intention of stopping after simply taking away their memories. Miss Ouji? They all must be punished. Kaori was dragged into it. But no one tried to help her. Taking no action itself was a crime. What in the world happened, Miss Ouji? It's your fault! You forced her to commit suicide! S-Stop! Don't... don't come near me! What is this? Miss Kokutou, I'm sure you know... ...you need a base to make a handler out of. It was an accident... Then, Hayama was... Go to sleep, Miss Kokutou. I will restore your grief in your hollow sleep. Miss Kokutou... Miss Kokutou... Miss Azaka... Miss Kokutou... B-Brother...? Yes? Mr. Kurogiri! I'm so sorry! You look pale. Did something happen? Well... ...I remember! But why? What?! The students in Class 1-4 are missing? Is there a secret Mass or something? There can't be... Could it be...?! Mr. Kurogiri. Did you see where Miss Ouji went? No, I haven't seen anyone but you, Miss Kokutou. Since she couldn't persuade me, she's resorting to force. Resorting to force? Right. Misaya Ouji is trying to erase the memory of Kaori Tachibana AND all the students in Class 1-4. Shiki, let's split up and look for them. Could you search inside the school building one more time? I'm going to search in the woods. I have an idea. Oh? There is nothing over there. Never mind. Just be careful. Thank you. Excuse us. How could this be...? Where could have they gone? They have to be somewhere on school property. Besides... that classroom... Mikiya... I wonder what Mikiya would do... What if it was Mikiya...? Subtransl.ed balloumowgly How come you don't cry? I wonder why. Hey, how come you don't cry? Come on! I'm tired! Leave me alone! Oh, Shiki! Did you find anything? No. Oh, by the way, you've got a call, Azaka. Huh? It's from your brother. Information on Hideo Hayama? Shiki asked for it, but I thought I should tell you. Oh? Shiki requested such a thing? Shiki told me you were concerned about Hayama. Yes, but I never said I wanted you to look into it. I don't want you to get involved in something dangerous like this. I'm sure Shiki is not a bit concerned about your well-being. She can't help it. Right now, Shiki is worried about YOUR well-being, Azaka. So, what did you find? I'll tell you about Shiki's request first and then give you a message from Miss Touko. Message from Touko? I told her exactly what you told me to. Good. Thanks. Are you sure we're not going to rescue them? Satsuki Kurogiri is a dangerous magus called Godot Word, right? I don't think it'll get too bad. He controls people's recognition using words, but he has no other means to attack. We told her the countermeasure. Besides, if she is my apprentice for real, she'll manage. Well, enough of that. Let's eat! Miss Kokutou. Mr. Kurogiri... Good evening. There's nothing in that direction. I'm in a hurry. So, if you'll excuse me... Isn't making everyone in class burn themselves to death a little overkill, Miss Ouji? Don't you think they deserve it, Miss Kokutou? This nonsense will all end tonight. Because the real mastermind will not get in the way. You do things in a roundabout way, don't you? What's your goal? I don't know. I simply granted someone else's wish. This is happening all because of those girls' wishes. I don't have a goal of my own, but... ...this must be fate. I came to this country at Souren Araya's request... ...to return the memories you lost to the oblivion two years ago. No, you, too, are looking for your lost memories. I can see your mind hidden in your words. That is my only duty. Regarding Miss Ouji... in human terms, I'd simply call it "killing time." One needs entertainment to live. If living is all you have, you are no different than a machine. Are you a magus, too? Yes. I a magus who controls words. I'm called Godot Word. Why don't we stop playing with fire? Miss Ouji. Stop joking around, Miss Kokutou. Stop now and it'll remain a joke. Some people have already died. Right. Hayama died... But you didn't kill him. The person who killed Hayama... ...is Hayama himself! The fairies told me that. You supposedly acquired magic for Kaori's sake and used Hayama as the foundation for the fairies. So why did they see the illusion of these "non-existent" fairies? Illusion? Rapid weight loss, emotional instability and hallucination... These are typical withdrawal symptoms of drug addiction. Kaori couldn't forgive herself for becoming a drug addict and tried to kill herself. The drugs gave Hayama a heart attack while you two talked. In other words, Hideo Hayama spontaneously died. Nobody died and nobody killed anyone. The only one left couldn't help a suffering Kaori Tachibana. They were first to look away from that inconvenience. Your memory was taken first, but that part was lost to oblivion. Aren't you aware that your revenge is... ...nothing but a convenient fancy that you wished for! Good... very good... Miss Kokutou! "AzoLto!" YOU are the one fantasizing, Miss Kokutou! I used the fairies to draw it out of the students in Class 1-4. So, I know that it's the unmistakable truth! Is that so? But... You couldn't hear it from Kaori or Hayama. Your truth is nothing but a rumor that came from the students after the incident. Everything came afterwards. Your motive for revenge as well as magic... And... What gave you power is... You will lose sight of where you're going. Again?! Scary. We can't talk if we're going to kill each other. But, a wish returns to its owner. It devours its host the moment he remembers and notices it. Your oblivion is in that category. You cannot see here. I shall replay the grief, even though you totally forgot it. Because the memory is vividly recorded inside you. How absurd! Miss Ouji! Out of my way! Do not... underestimate me!! Die already! Azaka! You're late! What were you doing? Is it over? Sure thing! Ciao! How have you been, Akira? Come on! Job well done, Azaka-chan. Yes. I heard the incident was settled without any trouble. By the way, I haven't been able to find Shiki. How generous of her. She worked really hard this time. So, it must be a treat. Miss Touko? Godot Word Mayday... The certified magus's work ended in vain this time. Miss Touko? Tell Azaka she did a good job. Oh, OK. I'll be sure to tell her. Brother, where's Shiki? I think she already went back. Did you need her for something? No. By the way, did you hear? Miss Tachibana regained consciousness. Yes. According to the testimony, she happened to be there when Hayama collapsed from an attack in October by an unhappy coincidence. To keep her silent, Hayama drugged her. She was a victim, too. What a sad memory. It would be better to forget. Azaka, what about the bus? It's freezing cold! Brother, I'm starved! What? Is there anywhere to eat around here? There's a café at the bottom of the hill. That's far. That's what you get for standing me up to go out with Shiki the other day. Don't bring that up... Then, don't whine. I had a dream about our childhood. Someone who was close and important to my brother and me passed away. He looked very sad but he never shed tears. How come you don't cry? I wonder why. Is it because boys aren't supposed to cry? Hey, how come you don't cry? I couldn't cry even if I wanted to. Because it's a special thing. His strength touched my heart. He is normal to the maximum and he is the last person to hurt anyone else. He can understand everyone but no one notices him. What an empty loneliness... At that moment... I think Mikiya Kokutou became someone precious to me, someone I should never lose at any cost. Under the starry night, we siblings looked up at the stars. That was my primal scene. A dream of the distant past I shouldn't have remembered. January, 1999 Fairy Tale. Oblivion Recording I remembered a dream I left behind in my childhood. A sadness of bright green singing sweetly and faintly... My fairytale... I knew an eternity where nothing would end. A story of the two no one talks about any longer. Leaving behind one kiss, where are you going? Holding a lamp close to you, you disappear into the forest, in the dark. A familiar figure is walking ahead in the distance. Your home is far away. You won't be able to make it there. Your fairytale... The eternity that I dreamed of will remain sealed. The mistake is deeply hidden. The trail home fades away and I cannot see you any longer. Goodbye... Leaving the misty forest, Where are you going? You wave to me once and head off to tomorrow. I fall in love with you and eternity ends. The joy and pain of living begins in the light. I don't like weak people. So, you chose to devour as a means of concealing the corpse? Why don't you keep drinking to the end? Are you bound by the human sense of morality? Then, why did you start? I thought it was a natural course of action. I see. That means you are special. I am special? That's right. Your common sense no longer exists. Does it mean I'm broken? Then, go ahead and break completely. An hour, eh? You're very good. But, that's your limit, too. That's as far as you can go, if you only realize your own origin. The Origin won't take shape unless you awaken it. Do you not wish to acquire the ability of a transcendental man not bound by anyone and... the uniqueness of an extraordinary life form? Understood. You are the first one. Who in the world are you? Magus... Souren Araya. What is your name? That's too bad. With only a single different letter, you would've been a lion. Preview of the Next Episode It only took you being there with a smile to make me happy. It comforted me, even though I was uneasy. It only took you being there walking to make me happy.
