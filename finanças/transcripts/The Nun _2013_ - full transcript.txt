THE NUN 1 765 The Château of Baron de Lasson - Hello, Marquis, how was your trip? - Fine, thanks. Well, Marquis, how was Tuscany? Exhausting. l'm very fond of that country. So am l, it's admirable and full of treasures. - Did you visit Arezzo? - Of course. l left as soon as l heard, father. And your health? As you can hear, too noisy. But l'm holding up. And the women? To die for. - Exquisite blonds. - And the brunettes! Perhaps you're hungry? Not right now. Then l'll go to bed. Ask Célestin to fix you something. We will talk tomorrow. Does M. Marquis desire a slice of plum pie? No, Célestin. Go to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight, sir. The Memoirs of Suzanne Simonin My father was an accountant. He married my mother at an advanced age. He had 3 daughters. Armelle was 19, Lucie, 18, and l was 16. 2 years earlier The Simonin Family Residence Suzanne? l feel like that wrong note sealed my fate. That everything stemmed from it. Your sister has been locked in her room since yesterday. ls it my fault he took a liking to me? - And you? - Me? l feel no attraction to him, or to anyone else in fact. l love Christ, and him alone. Truly? Yes, he is my lover. Did you tell Father Castellat? He says l'm too young to understand love. That l must grow up and pray. Monastic life, though austere, suited me well. The sisters were kind to me, but l only had myself to blame for telling my mother l loved God. l prayed less fervently. With my sisters Armelle and Lucie married off, l thought they'd soon come for me. Nevertheless the days were long. Suzanne! You have a visitor. Fear not, your family is well. You had me frightened! lt is they who sent me with a mission. They want you to take the veil. The veil? The mother superior speaks most highly of you. That's kind of her. You'll stay another year. - l was to leave in April. - l know. Let me explain. No explanation will change my mind. l have no fondness for religious life. Look... Your parents ruined themselves for your sisters. They can do nothing for you in their difficult situation. l ask for nothing. lt is they who are asking. Their minds are made up. Stay here or we'll find you another convent. Come, Suzanne, you're a big girl. Your parents aren't dead. What's this all about? Didn't Father Castellat tell you? He said your parents feel you should complete your novitiate. They want to bury me here! Bury you? No girl has ever become a nun against her will. What is asked of you? That you wear the veil. Well, why don't you? What does that commit you to? Nothing. To remain here a year. lt'll soon be over. So many things can happen in a year. ''To the crowd, ''Jesus spoke in parables. ''Without parables he spoke not, ''so the prophet's words might be fulfilled.'' Take care not to catch a cold. Your voice is a precious instrument that requires care. My voice isn't precious. The mother superior is a very indulgent nun. Her art is hiding all the thorns of religious life. lt is a subtle course of seduction. One is cradled, fascinated, lulled to sleep. Well, child, what shall our answer be? l don't want to. Think about it, child. Times are hard. Your family has suffered losses. Your sisters' affairs are in disarray. Marrying them was costly, supporting them ruinous. Word of your new vocation has spread in the world. For the rest, as l said, you can count on me. l have never lured anyone into religion. lt is a life God calls us to. And it is very dangerous to mingle our voice with his. l don't want to. You would disobey your mother? No, madam. All manner of visitors were sent to me. The doctor who lectured me. The Countess of Pérac, and my sisters, my dear sisters. Everyone tried to persuade me. No effort was spared to obtain my consent. ln a situation so abysmal, judge me as you will, sir, l gave in. Come in. This veil brings out the whiteness of your skin. Walk. You don't stand straight enough. There, that's better. The bandeau softens your features, and accentuates your cheeks. Let's hurry, it's already 8 o'clock. lt's lovely. l belong to him always. l will work to win him souls until my dying breath. You have heard our sisters' request. Are they fit to honor the solemn vows they're about to pronounce? l give my word. My children, this is a formidable oath you wish to take in the presence of Heaven and Earth. On Judgment Day, saints, angels, and Mother Mary herself, will turn against you, if you've been untrue. Are you resolved to sacrifice your own will? And to seek Jesus' love alone? l hereby resolve to keep in my heart no other love than that of Jesus Christ, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Lord, receive your servants who give their earthly lives to you. Who reject the world to embrace you alone. Make them worthy of the calling that unites them with you. That places them in your hands as in their Lord's. That sacrifices them to you as to their God. You who lives and rules for ever and ever. Amen. Marie Suzanne Simonin, do you swear to tell the truth? l swear. Are you here of your own accord and free will? Marie Suzanne Simonin, are you here of your own accord and free will? Marie Suzanne Simonin, do you promise God chastity, poverty and obedience? No, Father. Do you promise God chastity, poverty and obedience? l said no. What's going on? l don't know. Start over, my child. l cannot. l promised God the truth. He would never forgive me. All that for nothing. Sorry, sir. We've arrived. Wake up. Aren't you coming to bed, dear? No. We'll discuss this tomorrow. There's nothing to discuss. You've given in. You always give in. Well, not always. Stay. l'm exhausted, Roland. What about me? Don't you think l'm tired? Did you tell my mother? l had to. What did she say? She said you were too old for such things. lt's being back in this house. l asked you not to tell her. l didn't. l was just teasing. Pull your end, l have too much at mine. Come in. You're expected in the music room. Hello, Father. Hello, Suzanne. What do you think of this situation? Which one? That of a grown child shut in her room. You know this can't go on. What do you recommend? Your mother expects you to be reasonable. For her, being reasonable means staying locked in my room or a convent. ln these conditions, l'll never meet anyone. Did l say something wrong? No, Suzanne. You're forgetting what happened. lt was not l who spoke. The words came to my lips without guidance. lt was beyond my control. l couldn't lie. God would not allow it. You're very arrogant. l don't see what's arrogant about obeying God's will. Wouldn't the arrogance have been to lie? You reason too much, Suzanne. You put God where he doesn't belong. l'm fighting an injustice. And you use very fancy words. Am l so different from my sisters? Very. That ''very,'' what does it mean? This morning your mother gave me permission to reveal the secret behind her conduct toward you. You're not M. Simonin's daughter. 20 years ago she left Heidelberg to marry him. She had your two sisters. And then she met someone. An exile like herself. You're the fruit of that encounter. You sensed it. No. How foolish of me not to have realized sooner. - Do my sisters know? - No. - And my father? - Your father? My mother's husband. Your mother never told him. How could they rob their own sister? Self-interest, Suzanne. They wouldn't have gotten the large shares they did. This is a selfish world. l wouldn't count on them. They'll quarrel with you over every last penny. Lucie is a mother now, and Armelle is expecting. They'll put their children first and make you beg. Your mother is only acting out of concern for you. You don't know what poverty is. Come sit. Let's talk. You now know who you are. l thought you'd guessed. What is your reaction? l see that you don't love me. Who told you that? Do you want to know who he is? A handsome and cultivated man. Rich, very rich. He knew nothing of your birth. What little l can do for you, l will. l sold my jewels. l save whatever M. Simonin gives me out of generosity. What l keep for you is taken from your sisters. Can l trust you to claim no rights after l'm gone? Have a lawyer draw up a renunciation and l'll sign whatever you like. A child cannot disinherit himself. Spare me having to tell your father what he already suspects. ls the evil beyond remedy? ls there no way out? l'm willing to accept the husband l am assigned. Like you, a husband l don't love. How cruel. You look so much like your father. l still see him between us. Where is he? Knowing won't do you any good. Yes it will. l don't know myself. Must l really shut myself up in a convent? Your birth is my only sin. Help me expiate it. - Stay. - Are you sure? Yes. Suzanne, do you recognize this note? Yes, sir. Did you write it voluntarily? l can only answer yes. Will you honor what it promises? Yes. Very well. Do you prefer a particular convent? No, they're all the same to me. The days went by without news. l felt relieved. l spent those days dreaming. What had pushed my mother into the arms of another man? How had they met and split up? The image of this unknown father haunted my dreams. l imagined his body, his face, his hands. His love for me. See, l'm not dead yet. l wanted to make sure you were asleep. Alas, no. Sleep just won't come. To be honest, l hoped you'd be awake too. Father, l've just committed a grave indiscretion. l'd like to converse some. Anyone else wouldn't have read the manuscript. l left it there for you to read and you didn't wait. l waited years for something to happen that already had, without my realizing it. What? Love. And you let it get away? Read. l'll try to get some sleep. Go on. May l sit? Yes. l've gotten refusals. Many. Word got out. Only Mme. de Moni, the mother superior at St. Marie's agreed to take you back. lt's a stroke of luck. Don't spoil it again. See you soon, Suzanne. Will you come visit me? Of course. l'm happy. This morning, l saw the Lord's true face. Does that surprise you? A little. What does he look like? l'll only say if you promise not to tell. l can't promise such things. Too bad. Stop staring at me. l'm not. But l do find this silly. Because you're jealous. - What are you two plotting? - Nothing. Where is our mother superior? Can't you let her be? Crying is a beautiful thing. We're never so close to God as when we cry. l see your sisters with dry eyes. But where does this sadness come from? From not having the calling. What luck! l've always had it. All l ever wanted was to be in a convent. See how common that is? Not to mention l had nothing to sacrifice. You can laugh, Suzanne. lt's one odd Christian you see before you. lt was my sister's. l could never wear it. - l'm speechless. - Wear it. lt would be my joy. My sister? Don't touch me! No one touches me! Noli me tangere! Get off me! We took her in after a great fright she never got over. Don't let it upset you. - Why do you keep her? - Her parents, my dear. Her parents help the convent. l don't want to be like her. Don't be silly. She was going to kill me. Sister Bénédicte is harmless. She is touched, in the bad way. - There's a good way? - Yes. Mother? What's wrong? Are you ill? l know you're taking your vows tomorrow. And l want you to be happy. l'm not. You know that. All too well, Suzanne. The Spirit has left you. And there's nothing l can do. That's what distresses me. At Communion, l tasted the blandness of the wafer. God gave me a gift. Helping you and your sisters make it past this trial. l fear this gift is lost to me now. Forgive me. l'm sorry. l didn't want this. Sisters, one among us is lost. l ask that you pray for her. Lord, if l have committed any sin, l humbly beg your forgiveness. Do this for me. Wake up, it's time. Have you seen our mother? l spotted her earlier. Tell her the bishop is here. Mother? - Where am l? - ln the infirmary. You fainted. l want to go home. Lay still. Don't you remember? What? How long have l been here? Two days. Two days... What happened? You took your vows. You're our sister now. Where is our mother? You must be hungry. l'll fetch you some broth. - ls she better? - Yes, l was getting her broth. - Where is she? - This way. So, Sister Suzanne, have you come to your senses? How do you feel? Fine. l'm glad to hear it. We'll see you at tomorrow's office then? Who was that? Sister Christine, our new mother. l'll go get your broth. - How do you feel? - We were very worried. She's tired. Come, let's take a walk. l still haven't seen our mother. Where is she? Answer me. She has left us. To go where? To join our Lord. How did it happen? An accident. A terrible accident. lt was... Sister Bénédicte. What about Sister Bénédicte? The mother superior was meditating near the well, and in a bout of madness, that lunatic pushed her in. What is this? See for yourself. Mme. de Moni forbade them. Sr. Christine reinstated cilices. They are to be worn day and night. This will be verified. l wanted to read John, which Mme. de Moni so often read us. lt will be read to you in the chapel, in due time. What are you doing? Burning the torture instruments Mme. de Moni did away with. Please do the same. First l was banned from the refectory. l was deprived of mail, visits and confession. l was ostracized. Soon the other sisters refused to speak to me. Then came the bullying, the punishments. They've been watching me. - l couldn't come sooner. - They humiliate me. lt's my life they're after. To join our mother would be a relief. - Don't say such things. - Why not? No one saw Sister Bénédicte push Mme. de Moni. Some wicked tongues say she jumped. Her pulse is weak. Out of the way. - What happened? - She fainted. She looks malnourished. - Does she eat? - l don't know. She must be fed. lf she refuses, force her. With nourishment, she'll live. Sacraments won't save her, only food will. Did you sleep well? l could've gone to God fearlessly. l could see the skies opening up. Too bad. You must eat. What will become of Sr. Bénédicte? She's changing convents. Her family came for her last night. Go on. My father was an accountant. He married my mother at an advanced age. He had 3 daughters. Armelle was 19, Lucie, 18, and l was 16. l was praying. l thought l heard moaning. Goodnight. You defrauded the bursar of a pen and paper? And you broke an inkwell in the process? We're going to inspect your cell. Unless it would be simpler to give me what you've written? Sister Françoise saw you. Where is the paper? l no longer have it. What did you do with it? What one does with useless scribbles. l threw it away. What were its contents? A confession. Addressed to my father. You have plans. The common good demands l know of them. Your confession. Search. Undress her. Fully. Remove that. Wake up! Are you ready to obey our mother superior now? Swear that nobody will ever know what happened. Nobody will know. You swear? Yes, l swear. For the Tenebrae on Good Friday we're expecting guests. A concert is planned. You will sing. Here. Hide it. What shall l do with all these papers? You know people, l don't. But l'd rather die than implicate you. Never mind that. What is it? A request to leave the convent. See it reaches a lawyer and gets a response. My mother has contacts, she'll do this for me. l made inquiries, miss. Expect news shortly. Visitor. My name's Paul Manouri. l'm a lawyer. l come on behalf of the Countess of Ribe, who forwarded your request. The annulment of your vows is underway. But Rome is still deliberating. You must be patient. For the pope himself must give his nihil obstat. l shall be patient. Before any decision, the bishop or an envoy will want to talk to you. Rest assured l will answer all their questions. About your confession, what should l do with it? All you can. l'll write to report any progress. Sister Suzanne! Our mother wants to see you. So, Sister Suzanne, you want to leave us? Yes, madam. And annul your vows? Yes, madam. Who made you take them? Everything. Remember that perjury is the greatest of all crimes. l have not committed perjury. l have sworn nothing. lf you've suffered any wrongs, haven't we put them right? lt wasn't the wrongs that made my mind up. You'd abandon this veil that commits you to Jesus Christ without remorse? Yes, madam. My body is here but my heart isn't. lt is outside. You would dishonor us, subject us to ridicule, and destroy yourself? l want to leave. l want to leave. Child, the devil covets you. lt is he who animates you. Who speaks through you. Look at the state you're in. Madam, if you wish to avoid scandal, there's a way. l ask only for my freedom. Wretched girl. You dare to ask me this? Please. Henceforth, l forbid you to pray. Please! Sisters, l ask you to implore God's mercy for a nun who's forsaken him. And who is about to desecrate God and disgrace man. Tread on her, she's just a corpse. Madam! Apostate, stay away. l want you to give the order that l live. But are you worthy? Only God knows that. Go. Don't defile me with your eyes. l almost forgot. Your father wrote me to say your mother had been called back to God. Stand up and commend your soul to God. Speak as though you were standing before him. Ask forgiveness for all the sins of your life. Good. Since she won't commend her soul to God, tie her up. Hurry up! They're expecting us. Untie her. Untie her! Do you renounce Satan and his works? l'm not possessed. Why don't you go to confession? l'm forbidden to. Why don't you take communion? Because l am restrained. Why do you leave your cell at night? Because l am deprived of water, and a pot to relieve myself in. What did you do to the nun who was torn from your hands and found lying in the corridor? A lie. What frightened her was the picture of me they painted. Had you ever acted improperly to her? Never. Why don't you wear a crucifix? They took it away. Then how do you pray? With my heart and soul, though l was forbidden to pray. Madam, did you forbid her this? l did... Why is your clothing so filthy? l haven't had clean linen or a bath in a month. l confess l made a terrible mistake, that brought this on me: that of not heeding my calling and renouncing my vows. The law will decide this matter. Well, madam? This is appalling! You aren't worthy of your functions. You should be dismissed. l shall lodge a complaint with His Grace. ln the meantime, clean up this mess. Ave. You have a visitor. Didn't you receive my letter? No. Yet l mailed it over a month ago. What did it say? Young lady, had you been my niece, l wouldn't have done more. Rome refused? lndeed. l'll never get out of here. You will, but you didn't give me time to finish. Mme. de Ribe, your friend Ursule's mother, moved heaven and earth to relocate you. Her daughter told her how fond she was of you. ln exchange for this favor, your friend's agreed to stop seeing you. Her mother fears you might contaminate her. Me? Your demeanor. lt's no use opposing it. So l won't see Ursule any longer? No. Aren't you cold? No. l hate winter. l like all the seasons. Will we meet again? Without a doubt, madam. Your case has some grey areas l'd like to clear up. lt's still too soon, but l'll keep you informed. What's your name? Antoinette. - Jeanne. - Rose. Gabrielle. - Marie. - Bernadette. Did you have a safe journey, child? Yes, Mother. Good. We shall try to right the wrongs you suffered. Your superior was my pupil at Port-Royal. She was vile to her classmates. But we'll discuss that later. Leave us now. Come with me. The mattresses are soft, the sheets aren't fine, but they're the community's. How tall you are. What's your height? l don't know. See you later. l came to see if you needed anything. No, Mother. Go to bed now. lt's been a long day, you must be tired. A little. You must comb your hair. Yes. l can help you if you like. Unless you'd rather do it yourself. l would, Mother. ln that case, l'll leave you. Sleep well. l excuse you from morning prayer. You need to rest. Sister Suzanne. Wake up, it's 9 o'clock. Look at your new robe. You're one of our sisters now. Good morning, my child, did you sleep well? Your soup is waiting. Hurry up and eat it. Afterwards, we'll chat. Several came to me as children. Sr. Agnés arrived at age 4. Her mother died at birth and her father 6 months later of sorrow. Do you have siblings? Yes, two sisters. What do they do? They're married. - With children? - Yes. Don't you regret not raising a family? No. Good. Obeying a man you didn't chose, whom you may not respect. Thankfully most women don't even think about it. Did your mother love your father? - l don't know. - Goodness, l'm prying. Mother? Well, what is it Sr. Thérése? Nothing. ls something on your mind? There's one who couldn't stand marriage. Surprised? lt can be hell when you have no appetite for it. l'm sorry, l don't know the rest. That's all right. lt was divine. Sing us something. Perhaps that's all she knows. Don't insist. That's enough for today. No, she has a lovely voice. l'll let her go when she's sung something. Perhaps they've had enough. But l haven't. My father gave me a husband Who was no bigger than an ant What a good soul, the little man What a little man Who was no bigger than an ant The first night, l slept with him What a good soul, the little man What a little man That's enough. Go back to your cells. You too, Thérése. l wanted to talk to Sister Suzanne. You will. But right now, it is my turn. One mustn't give in. Sister Thérése, your worrying is growing tedious. l'm sorry, Mother. Sister Thérése! What did you want to tell Suzanne? You're right, l'll have a word with her. Her heart seems heavy. l know it's not your fault. Promise you'll see her as little as possible. What does it matter how often l see her, since you know l'm not competing with you? What were you saying? Sister Thérése is upset. Sister Thérése, you'll have no quarrel with me if you give up these exclusive claims. Remember what l did with Sr. Agathe. l loved her as l love you all, when Sr. Thérése arrived. She had the same fears, the same follies. l warned her, but she did not change. l had to resort to measures contrary to my character. Come, Sister Suzanne, l'll walk you back. You, return to your cell and don't come out. Forgive me, Mother! Stand up. Forgive my selfishness. ln your case, Thérése, forgiveness no longer suffices. Go. l'll see you later. l was in my cell alone, l endured a few moments. You're wearing her patience. Can't our mother love us both equally? That's impossible. Soon l'll repulse her and it will kill me. lt's dead. Mother, it wasn't me. Stand up. Bless your kindness, but l don't deserve it. You deserve much more. l cannot accept it. lt's not fair to my sisters. Sit down here. Sister Suzanne, do you love me? How could l not love you? l'd be a very ungrateful soul. You have so much kindness. Call it fondness. You don't love me. - Yes, l do. - No, you don't. What must l do to prove it to you? Guess. l guess nothing. Kiss me. Again. Again, Suzanne, again. Mother, what's wrong? lt's nothing. lt's nothing. How old are you? 1 7 and a half. l want to know your whole life, will you tell me? Yes, dear mother. l'm a little tired. l need to rest. One day you'll tell me what's happened in your little soul. Thank you for receiving me, sir. What's this about? But l had a happy childhood with my sisters. l assure you. Mother, l apologize if my story caused you any pain. Don't fret, Suzanne. l like to cry. You said your first superior was very dear to you? Yes. l love you as much, but you loved her more. l was miserable and she eased my pain. Where does your distaste for religious life come from? l have a different calling. Which one? l'm not sure. To know life. What impression does a man make on you? lf he speaks well, l listen. lf he's handsome, l notice. ls your heart untouched? Your senses tell you nothing? l don't know their language. Yet they do have one. Would you like to learn it? l'd rather know nothing than acquire knowledge l can't satisfy. Forgive me. We converse about notions so foreign to me. l forgive you, Suzanne, but you intoxicate me. Mother, we've been here a long time now. You're right, with you time flies. Who's there? lt is l, Suzanne, don't be alarmed. What are you doing, why aren't you asleep? No sooner had l closed my eyes, than your sorrows awoke me. l saw you in the clutches of those monsters. l wanted to leave but l couldn't resist seeing if you were well. l always fear something will happen to you. l'm fine, l assure you. What's wrong? You're crying. Take pity on me. What can l do? l'm freezing. Turn back the cover so l can get near you, warm myself and be healed. l'll move over and leave you the warm spot. Yes, let me get warm and then l'll leave. Come close to me. There. l'm so cold. l'm afraid to touch you with my icy hand. Let me, Suzanne. Look at me. Sister Thérése must have seen you in the corridor. lf it's her, she'll remember her temerity a long time. Sleep, Suzanne. l excuse you from prayer. Let her die. Let her die, my Father. You asked for me. Did you sleep well? That's what l thought. Sister Thérése is mad. l'll have her locked up. Don't do that. Why shouldn't l? Because l know how horrible it is. Going already? Father Morante awaits me for confession. Avoid telling him what happened last night. Such things excite curiosity. Anyway, confession isn't required. But Mother, tomorrow's Pentecost. Come see me tonight. You'll confess to me. You've committed no sin l can't absolve you of. She told me: ''What harm in silencing what there's no harm in doing?'' Meaning? Explain yourself. That certain things we do needn't be confessed because they're not wrong. What are you referring to? Fits of passion. Kisses. Kisses? Yes. Did you accept them? Last night... she came into my cell. She was cold. She asked to get into bed with me. - lf it happens again, turn her out. - That's impossible. Decline her invitations, as if they were Satan's. Do not ask for more. Praise God for protecting you so far. Are you in good health? Yes, Father. Then tonight you'll come here. You'll kneel before the altar and pray all night. You'll stop seeing me? You'll shun me? l promised. This isn't the first time your rector's interfered. As soon as l grow fond of someone, he turns her against me. He nearly drove poor Thérése mad. Stop avoiding me. l can't live without you. Thérése! Help me! l'll be all right. Let me be. lsn't it true that no one possessed her grace? Divine grace. l'm certain she is praying for you now. Don't you hear her prayer? Don't you hear her prayers? lsn't it true that no one possessed her grace? Divine grace! l'm certain she's praying for you now. Don't you hear her prayers? Come, Mother. Come with me. Give me my prayer book. l heard death knells all night. My head is burning up. Rest. Suzanne is dead. No, Mother. She is alive. She is dead. No. lt's the bird that's dead. - Hello, Father. - Hello, Sister. You asked to see me? This opens the door l sometimes use. The one at the end of the cloister. Take it. Take it. Your protector needed time to plan your escape. At daybreak, a coach will wait for you on the low road. lt will take you to him. l owe you a confession. l did not desire my ministry. Like you, l was coerced. But unlike you, l did not rebel. The world awaits you, Suzanne. lt needs people like you. Who are you? Where are you taking me? Get in, Suzanne. Hurry. We have a long journey ahead of us. Are you cold? A little. l'm the Marquis of Croismare. Your father informed me of your arrival. Did you have time to talk with him? He died last night. He was your father, wasn't he? He waited to see you before he died. Adaptation: David H. Pickering Subtitles: L.V.T. - Paris
