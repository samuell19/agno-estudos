[THEME MUSIC] THEME SONG: The Sons of Hercules. The mighty sons of Hercules once thundered through the years. These men of steel could never feel the curse of a coward's fears. The mighty sons of Hercules were men as men should be. They burned with dreams and turned their dreams into history. A hundred giants, brave and bold, they ruled the world in days of old. The mighty sons of Hercules were men as men should be. They took the world and shook the world, the sons of Hercules. The mighty sons of Hercules once thundered through the years. These men of steel could never feel the curse of a coward's fears. The mighty sons of Hercules were men as men should be. They burned with dreams, then turned their dreams into history. NARRATOR: Through the centuries in olden times there lived the sons of Hercules, heroes supreme. They roamed the Earth, righting wrongs, helping the weak and oppressed, and seeking adventure. They were the mightiest of mortal men. One of them was Nippur. It is of his deeds we tell now. Of his struggle with the beast of Babylon. -Strange. The whole sky seems on fire. -What's happening? -It must be the end of the world. -The ground in the valley is opening up. The water in the stream is turning brown. -We are going to die, I know it! -Keep calm. Keep calm. -It's a divine punishment. -Tamira, it's terrifying. What's going to happen to us now? -Nothing can hurt us more than we are hurt already. The skies will take revenge on the powerful, not on the sufferers. -I don't understand. It's all on fire. -To my mind, it's prophesying death from famine. -Famine can strike any country in the world, but never Babylon, which has the richest grain source in the Orient. -Get back to work! Work, you lazy wretches, work! Work, I say! -No! Oh, God who watches over all, have pity on us. I beg you. -Get up and work! -Who's there? -Follow me! -What is it? -What a strange object that is in the sky. What can it possibly mean? What do you think, Licardio? -You mustn't be afraid of it. That sign in the heavens means no harm to any of us. -Do you think some moment has finally come, Licardio? -I hope so, Atalati. -Licardio! Help us, Licardio! -I need words with the king, Licardio. -Try to keep calm and have faith in us. Perhaps the day of our liberation is not far off. -The evil spirits of the god of fire-- do you think they signify some danger? -The walls of Babylon are indestructible. Not even the fire god would ever be able to penetrate them. -Do you think that Babylon is in no danger, Ura? -There is danger. -Get out, all of you! Now speak freely. -I have absolute proof that all the prisoners, together with the slaves, are plotting to rise and revolt against your power. The time has come, Balthazar, to show your strength. The Sargon is still alive. -He was my father's brother, and I imprisoned him. -It's not enough. He's your enemy. He still has many followers among the people. He's a threat to you. -But if I should have him executed, there will be the danger that his protector, Nippur, will come and remove me from the throne. -The powerful Nippur has been away from Babylon for years now. It's in Babylon that your-- your enemies are impeccable. -I see what you mean, Ura. I've been too generous with them all. I'll destroy every single one of those treacherous dogs! -That's what I hoped to hear you say, my lord. -Did you hear me, Anarsi? Arrest all those who are under suspicion, and bring me immediately here to the palace the most beautiful of the slave girls, who should be sacrificed to the goddess Ishtar. -Your orders will be carried out promptly and thoroughly. -Did you hear that, Agar? -Yes. What's going on? -I don't know. But stay calm. -Let's turn back. I'm afraid. -But if we don't deliver the food, our people will starve to death in prison. Give that to me. I'll go alone. -No. I'll go with you. -Well come on, then. [SCREAMING] -Get her! Hurry up, get that little harlot! After them! -No! -Open the door! [INAUDIBLE] again. I barely managed to escape. What a miracle. -Oh, god. You're safe here. -We will find some way to hide you. -Come on! -Let me go! [SHOUTING] -Come on! -Let me go! -Come on! -Help! -Stop struggling! -This one. -No! No! No! No! No! No! No! -Take her. -No! Take your hands away, you beast! -Stand up there. -No! No! -This one, two, too. -Have pity on me! Have pity on me! No! No, please, leave me here! -Get away from me. You're dirtying my robes. -Please spare my wife, most noble lord. I implore you, for the sake of the children. -Take him away! -No! Let me go! -Get to work! Get to work! -No! No! Oh, let me go! -Get up, girl. Let's have a look at you. Very pretty. Take her along. We have enough of them now. -You know, Nippur, I'll wager that nobody in Babylon will recognize you. -Babylon's king will remember me. -Have you decided what your first step will be? -First to get to the Sargon Mithitar. -Babylon is ruled by terror. They've returned to human sacrifice, just as I described it to you. If they should discover that Licardio sent me to Cyrus' court to warn you what was happening in Babylon, I'd be executed on the spot. -Babylon should know that the throne belongs to Mithitar. Not to Balthazar. I've sworn an oath to defend Mithitar. -Move along! She's escaped! Follow her! -After her! -She must be recaptured at once! -After her! Come on, after her! Stop her! Stop! Do you hear me? I said, stop! -No! No! -Come on! -Let me go! -Come on! You stupid girl! Well, get on with it. We've got to catch the other one. -The water feels good after that ride. -Before nightfall, we've got to be in Babylon. -Yes. -Let's go on, Nippur. -Look over there. Who are you? -Please help me, I'm in danger. -Get her out of the way, and stay with her. -You misterable cowards! Getting yourselves beaten by one lone man. Come along, you good for nothings. -That'll take care of them. -It'll take some time before they can round up their horses. And besides, you've scared the life out of them. -I asked who you are. -I'm a slave from the mines. And I shall be grateful to you all my life. My name is Tamira. -Come on, you two. There's no time to lose. The guards may come back any moment to capture her. -Let's get away from here. We'll find a place to hide her. -I know a good place. I'll show it to you. -It just isn't possible. Believe me, it's not possible to hide a slave girl who've run away from the guard as she has. -She'll only be here a short while, and then we'll find another hiding place. Please take her. -But you're a stranger here, and can't know what a horribly dangerous thing you're asking of me. If they should discover her, they'll burn me alive in front of the temple. -Must we give her to those slave drivers? -Listen to me. If you are of the same [INAUDIBLE] tribe, you must know Licardio. -Yes, of course I do. He's the only one among our people who has enough influence in the court of Babylon to protect us. -I'm one of his closest friends. I promise you that we'll find another hiding place for this girl. -Leave her here with me, then. But return here as soon as possible. I beg this of you for the sake of my children. -We promise it. -Right. We must leave now. Please don't do that. -But you have saved my life today. You're my lord and master now. -I'm only a man who hates cruelty. -I know. -Now you are free. -But I won't remain free if you leave me alone. -Licardio will take good care of you. -No one is as strong and courageous as you are. And what if I never see you again? -I hope I'll see you again, Tamira. -So you and all your soldiers were beaten and robbed of a slave girl a man who fought alone? -But he possessed the strength of a hundred armed men. -Then I say to you, the whole lot of you who are weaker than one true soldier-- that man must be found and captured, whatever the cost. -A man of such great strength cannot move about unobserved. Before long, he must fall into our hands. -Now-- -No! No! Let me go! Let me go! No! No! No! -Mursuk! -No! No! No! No! No! -What's your business here? -We're merchants. -Good. Pass through. You two, take your posts. -I'm going to introduce myself to Balthazar. You go and try to found out where they imprisoned Mithitar. -Careful. At court there's a reliable man named Tibis. His wristguard has our tribal sign on it. -Come over here. That's he. It's the man who rescued the slave girl. -Surround them. -Tibis will keep you in touch with the rest of us. You can trust him. -Go after that one. And you come with me. Seize him! After him! -That's the beginning of another sacrifice. -We must do something, then. Put an end to all these horrible sacrifices. -Yes. It's time for action. -Keep calm, my friends. We must be patient for the right moment. -We must not allow them to kill those innocent Libyan girls. My people are ready to rise in rebellion on my orders. -And the Frijians await my orders. -And my Ammonites. -Yes, they're all ready. All of them. Hebrews, Persians, even the people of Babylon, because believe me, there are many honest and humane people among them, all horrified by the cruelty of Balthazar. -Well, then, what are we waiting for? Are you afraid? -No, it's not fear. I'm not afraid, Namar. I'm convinced that with our forces alone, we'll never overthrow him and his soldiers. We need help from outside. And I have already sent for it. You are forgetting that hundreds of our people are enslaved. They're working in the mines, and in the quarries. An uprising would mean certain death. -Hide yourselves. Open the door. -Namar. -Atalidaes. -It's wonderful to see you back here. We've been so worried. -Good evening, friends. -Welcome back. -Welcome back. -Nippur has just returned here with me, but first he wants to check the situation at court and find out what's happened to the Sargon. -Welcome, Namar. -Welcome, Namar. -Have you all heard the good news, my friends? A man of great strength and courage who has arrived from the court of Cyrus, and loves liberty and detests oppressors has come to join us. -What help can this foreigner be to us? Who is he? -Well, at the moment I can tell you no more about him. You must trust me. -Oh, divine and powerful goddess of fire, Ishtar, accept the unworthy lives of these, your slaves, and defend from all of her enemies the power of Babylon and her king, Balthazar. -Agar! -That's he. Go and warn the others. -Agar! Agar! -Namar! Namar! At last. How long I've waited for this moment. -For me, too. It's seemed like a lifetime since I saw you. -The most terrible things have been happening. They've captured many yo -I've heard, Agar. But listen to me, there's every hope that we'll soon be free from our oppressors. -To be free-- how many nights I've dreamed of it while you were away. Of you and me married, far away from here, free and safe at long last. -It won't be long now, Agar. Nippur's returned with me, and he'll help us. Just you wait and see. -There he is! Take him prisoner! Seize the girl, too! -Namar! Help! Help! Let me go! [SHOUTING] -Accept, oh sublime Ishtar, this humble offering. [SCREAMING] -Namar, you shouldn't have come here. -I know, but I need your help. I was attacked by a group of guards. They captured, Agar, my promised bride, for the temple sacrifice. Only you can save her life. -I promise, but go now, before somebody recognizes you. Later I'm going to introduce myself to Balthazar, and then I'll see what I can do. -Thank you, Nippur. -Go. Greetings to you, King Balthazar. -My long absent friend, you're most welcome at my court. After many years, I'm delighted that you return to my kingdom. And I'm very happy that you've come back just as I was about to send for you. You've been too long in Persia at the court of King Cyrus. -Cyrus has been very hospitable toward me. He taught me many valuable lessons in the art of war. -Then you'd be able to take command of the armies for Cyrus, then decide to attack Babylon. -He has no intention of attacking you, but Cyrus is unhappy to hear of the slavery the people, and how they are tortured. I have seen this with my own eyes. -These are legitimate precautions to discourage treachery within the bounds of our own territory. We must forestall and crush the smallest sign of rebellion. -The only way to control the people is through fear. -What about the human sacrifices I've seen? -Have you forgotten our religion, and the respect due to the goddess Ishtar? -Our ancestors abolished human sacrifice. -That is why Babylon in those times was not as powerful as she is today. -Where is Mithitar? -The noble, proud Sargon is on a special mission to the king of the Partheons. He should return in a month. He would be happy that you've come back to us. -He has been imprisoned. -Your information is incorrect, my friend. On the other hand, you might like to see for yourself, with your own eyes. Come with me. Come and look over my prison cells. -Wait a moment. I have something to tell you. I recognize him. It is the strange man who ran off with the slave girl in the forest of Sibook. -Do you think he was able to recognize you, also? -No, no, that's highly improbable. I was careful to keep out of the way during the struggle. -All the better. -But he's dangerous to have in the palace. -Perhaps he'll be much less dangerous than you think. If we can hide what we know about him, the knowledge will be useful. And I know just how to handle this affair. -The prisons are below here. You can see the Sargon is in none of these cells. These only contain the enemies of Babylon. But come with me. I have something much more attractive to show you. These are the slaves of the great goddess Ishtar. I can only hope that she will forgive me if I deprive her of one of them as a present for you. Choose one. -Come on! It's no use struggling. Move! -Good. Another magnificent example to offer the goddess at the next sacrifice. -Who is this girl? -Agar is her name. She is Idominian. -Make me a present of her. -Very well. You've chosen the prettiest one. This very night, Agar the slave girl shall be brought to your apartment in garments worthy of your rank. Take her away. -You may go. I'll serve him. -What is your name? -Tibis, master. Tibis. -Listen to me, Tibis. They're going to bring Agar here tonight. You must find a way to warn Namar. -Very well, my master. -How will he be able to come here and rescue the girl? -He'll climb over the wall at the corner and make his way through the garden. They haven't posted any guards. -I'll leave a cloak on the balcony so that he will know exactly where to come. Now go, and don't let anyone see you. -You can safely trust me, my master. -You are welcome, Ura. -Even if you were expecting to see Agar, the slave girl? -A visit from the high priestess of Babylon is an honor. -Agar will not be brought here to you. I've convinced the king that such a gift would be an act of sacrilege. -I did not suggest this sacrilege. -But you've already committed one, by rescuing a girl who was destined to be sacrificed to Ishtar. -That's not true, your honor. -Anarsi has recognized you, Nippur. But the king knows nothing of it, and will never be told anything. -Would you mind explaining what you mean? -You mustn't be so impatient. I'll explain, don't worry. Agar is the promised bride of the young man who returned with you to Babylon. You hope to give her back to your friend, and by doing so, would have stolen two victims away from Ishtar. But even this story will never reach the king's ears through me. -I'm really curious to know what's behind this great generosity of yours, Ura. -Sit down here. -I wish only for you to join forces with me, Nippur. We must become intimate friends. For the benefit of Babylon. -The cruelties being committed in this court disgust and horrify the whole world, and I will have nothing to do with them. -A man who is as strong and intelligent as you surely are should have no difficulty understanding these things. -Understand what? Are you suggesting a conspiracy? -What you call it conspiracy to save the life of a man? To offer him friendship? And perhaps something more? -If you mean-- -No, don't try to answer me right now. -If you really mean to be my friend, tell me the truth about Mithitar. -That's another very good reason why you should give careful thought to my proposals. We shall meet again soon. -Agar! Where is she? -My plan went wrong. Ura knows what I'm doing. But I still think I'll be able to save her. Warn Licardio that Tamira is in danger, too. We'll meet tomorrow in the Shepherd's cave. Go! -Hurry, we must get the alarm. -Nippur. Did they follow you? -Yes, but I managed to throw them off my track. Did you do as I said about Tamira? -Yes. Here's Licardio. He's come to take her away . -I'm happy to know and serve you, Nippur. Now don't worry, I'll take her where she'll be quite safe, in the cavern of the vultures. -Thank you, Licardio. I would have liked to take her to Persia to Cyrus, but I can't leave Mithitar alone in the power of Balthazar. But now I'm going to join you. Your cause has become mine. -Then I must thank you, Nippur. That's what I'd hoped to hear. But I'm afraid I have bad news about Mithitar. -Our information from a reliable source is that he was never sent on a mission to the Partheons. -I might have known it. Who knows where they've imprisoned him? -We'll redouble our efforts to find him, I assure you. -Now I must be getting back to the palace. The ambassadors from Cyrus are expected tomorrow, and I want to be there. -Very well. -The best of luck, Nippur. -The same to you. Farewell, Tamira. -Nippur! I beg of you, please listen a moment. I won't see you anymore. -I'll come back. -Oh, please don't leave me. I have no one else in the world. -You will never be alone again. Because I love you, Tamira. -And I love you, too. But I don't even know who you are. -That doesn't matter now. You'll know when you can live by my side, without fear. Farewell, Tamira. -I'll wait for you. All my life. -To pieces of gold on the red. -I'll put double on the green! -I'll accept any kind of bet on the red one. -Six pieces of gold on the red. -Eight on the green! -Ten on the red! -15 on the green! -20 on red! -Splendid, Nippur. If you would deign to enter this contest, I'm prepared to wager my throne on you. -I'd prefer to remind you that the ambassadors from Cyrus are waiting to see you, while you watch your wrestling match. -How can he dare stop the fight? -Have them shown in. I am grateful to you for having reminded me of them. Your friend Cyrus' mission is of so little importance to me that it quite slipped my mind. I'll double my wager on the wrestler in red. -Cyrus, king of Persia, and our noble ruler, sends greetings to the King of Babylon. -What does Cyrus want from me? Speak up! -The heart and ears of our illustrious sovereign have been tormented by desperate appeals for help, for the people you have oppressed within your territory. -They are people that I have defeated, and I insist on my right to treat them as becomes a victor. Your wretched King has absolutely no authority to inferfere in my affairs! -To the wanton spilling of innocent blood, no one can claim a right. -King Cyrus has already called up his armies, and is ready to move into battle. Through us he invites you to think carefully. Give back their freedom to the people you've oppressed. Do this in the name of justice, before the Persians decide to cross your frontiers and make war on you. -Mursuk! Seize this man and chop off the hand that dare to offer me this impertinent threat. That's it. That's my considered reply to Cyrus. -You'll be sorry, Balthazar. I'll be avenged by King Cyrus. -Balthazar, your order brings dishonor to every king in the Orient. -The might and strength of the Orient lies in me-- in me, only. And you, good friend of Cyrus, remember the might of my family, and the might of Babylon! -Listen to me, Balthazar-- -Nippur! Come with me, I beg you. -Anarsi, search through the city, and the countryside. Arrest all those suspected of rebellion. We'll put to torture every single one of them. Women and children, too. Without pity. And Ishtar will have rivers of blood to glorify her name. With this, I'll show my opinion of Cyrus. Come, friends. Let us get back to our wrestling match. I'll accept any wager you like on the red one. -I can't stand such horrible cruelty any longer. -Be careful, Nippur. If you make a false move, the king will be told all about you. -I'm not afraid for my own life. -But if you end your life in chains, or you're killed, tell me what you will have achieved. -Listen, Ura, what do you want of me? -You still don't understand. I've always had everything and everyone I've wanted. Wait a moment. I have brought the reply to the question you asked. -That belongs to Mithitar. Where is he? What happened to him? -I want to avoid your coming to the same end. -He's been killed. Balthazar will pay for this with is life's blood, the treacherous murderer! -I've already made you a proposition. If you want to be revenged, you know what you must do for me. Nippur! He's mad enough for anything. Just follow him, and take care he doesn't get out of your sight. I want to know every single move he makes. -Who are you? -I'm Nippur, a friend of Licardio. I must speak to him at once. -Wait here. -I have spoken with the nobleman Anur. There are many people of Babylon ready to join us in a rebellion against the tyrant. Show him in at once. -Licardio, we can't possibly wait another day. During the next sacrifices, they're going to offer up Agar. -And my two young sisters. -We must attack immediately. -This way. Licardio is waiting for you. -I'm so happy you've come at last. -We weren't expecting you, Nippur. What's happened? -The diplomats failed in their attempt. Cyrus must now be advancing across the frontier. -Balthazar, in reprisal, has ordered the arrest of all suspects. Not even here are you safe anymore. -Then we'll return to the city. -And during the coming sacrificial rites, we'll kill the tyrant. -That's impossible. You'll never get near him. -We must at least try it. Otherwise, the lives of our young girls will be sacrificed like hundreds in the past. -Gather all the women and go to join Cyrus. We must get in touch with him at once. Which his help, we will surely be victorious. Don't believe what he says. He's a traitor. He'll deliver us into the hands of the king. -Listen to me, I say! He saved the life of Tamira at the risk of losing his own. -He saved me too, when I was arrested. Nippur hates the king as much as we do. -I'm sorry. -Well then, what have you decided? Are you going to do as I told you? -No. We'll try to kill the king in the temple of Ishtar during the coming ritual. -We're all behind you, Nimone. -I entreat you all, you mustn't give in to rash impulses. Your very lives, our cores, everything will be placed in terrible danger. -Licardio, we're not going to be persuaded to turn back by anyone. We've made our decision. -Then I can only leave you. And may the gods help you. -What do you think will happen now? I'm so afraid for you. -Don't worry, Tamira. I'll be back soon. -There's already a big crowd in the temple. 10 of the loveliest young girls are going to be sacrificed to the goddess Ishtar. The king himself has chosen them. Agar is one of them. -You may go, Tibis. I can manage alone. Go on. Speak. -Why have you put on armor to go to the temple, instead of your ceremonial robes? -Because-- -No, never mind. I'll tell you the reason. During the ceremony, they will attempt to kill the king. And you are among the conspirators. -I swear by the gods that I am not going to kill Balthazar. -But you know that the attempt will be made, and so you have prepared yourself against all eventualities. -What do you intend to do, your honor? -I will do absolutely nothing. Let them go ahead and kill the king. -That makes you an accomplice. -In a certain sense, we two together, you and I. The minute the king is murdered, we will arrest the killers easily and will have them executed on the spot. Then we two will ascend the throne together. Agreed? -But that's terrible. I couldn't agree to a thing like that. -You could turn away from a woman who offers love and a throne? -I'm disgusted by your double treachery. -Very well, Nippur. If you refuse me, the king will soon know of the conspiracy, and if you have often visited the grotto of the rebels. The conspiracy will be overthrown at once, and it will be the end of you. And the slave girl you love will be recaptured because I know where she's hidden. Can't you see you have no other choice? -Why are you so against Balthazar? He's made you powerful. Why won't you answer my question? -Because I love you, and I want to reign at your side. Balthazar has always scorned my desire to be on the throne. -Very well. After all, the throne of Babylon rightfully belongs to Mithitar. -I'll make you forget all about your silly little slave. I'll be waiting for you at the temple. -Tibis, come here. You must go at once to Namar and Licardio. -There he is. Come on. Hurry! Stop there. you're coming with us. -Coming with you? What have I done? Perhaps you've made a mistake. -Don't move. It's too early to act yet. -Namar! Help me! Namar! Namar, help me! -The first one! -Namar! No! No! Namar! No! Namar! No! No! -Don't anyone come forward! Your plans are discovered! -Arrest that man! He's a traitor! Why are you standing here? Go and arrest him. -Follow me, men! -Come on. We can block the guards and help him to escape. -After him, you fools! -You've allowed him to escape from you! Nippur, friend of Cyrus of Persia! -He got away. -Ishtar, the appalling sacrilege committed before your eyes, filled with divine fire. -No! Don't do anything now! - --will pay with his life for his crimes. The first one. -No! No! No! Help! -That young dog must be captured and imprisoned, or you will pay with your own head, Anarsi. -Have no fear, my master. I dearly value my head. I have bait to make him deliver himself into our hands. -Come on. Get on your feet. Get up, all of you. -No! -Tie them up quickly. Understand? -Let me go! None of these wretches must get away. -Nippur! -Your belov Nippur will be with you soon. And you'll be together again for all eternity. Away with her. -No! -Bring them all out. -Nippur! -Halt! -Come here! Come here, quickly! -Is he dead? -No, he's still breathing. -Be careful. -It wasn't one of our arrows. He seems to be a warrior of high rank. -Good. We'll take him to our camp immediately. Cyrus will be able to get important information from him. Lift him carefully. -We'll advance with our main forces through the valley, but without the cavalry. -What do you want to do with the cavalry? -In two wings, they will precede the troops behind this hill, and on the eastern side of the riverbed. Ah, it's good to see you well and strong again, Nippur. -Thanks to your care. -Splendid. You'll be able to take your place at my side against Balthazar. -The walls of Babylon have resisted all attacks for many centuries. Even the strongest armies have found them insuperable. -But they didn't have a general like Cyrus. -But a strategist like Cyrus knows very well that to take the city, one needs help from the inside. -What do you suggest we do? -I'll tell you. With your permission, I'll return to Babylon and stir up a revolt among the oppressed people. While Balthazar is busy with them, you can attack the city. -Have you sound reasons for thinking this plan would be successful? -I'm sure, Cyrus. All the slaves are ripe for rebellion. We'll have to coordinate their uprising with your assault on the city. It won't be easy. But I'm sure we can do it. -I accept. We'll adopt your proposals. But how will you manage to warn me when the rebellion has started in Babylon? -Keep a sharp lookout every night. When we fire lighted arrows from the tower, that will mean the moment has come. -My orders are to cross the frontier and attack the armies of King Balthazar. -I'll leave at once. -Our army will be beneath the walls as soon as possible. -Atalidae, have you heard any news about the prisoners? -No, Namar, it's become impossible. No one can get anywhere near the dungeons of the temple. Why, we can no longer even talk with the guards. They never let them-- [KNOCKING] -Open the door. -Who is it? -It's Nippur. I'm looking for Licardio. -Nippur! You may come out now. It's Nippur. -Nippur! -All thanks to the gods. We were certain we had lost you. -Listen to me. Cyrus has attacked the Babylonian army. We must rise up. -That's impossible. Too many of us have been arrested. -We were lucky to be able to hide in this house. -I'm afraid that Tamira has been arrested, too. -Tamira? Where have they taken her? -She has been imprisoned in the dungeons of the temple. -That witch! I might have guessed it! I've got to get her out of there. -You must be insane. The dungeons of the temple have no doors. They're shut away from the world. -I'll go to the temple right away. One of the priests will help me. There are still people in Babylon who remember the one rightful heir to the throne. -May the gods assist you, Nippur. -In the meantime, Licardio, you must get together all the men who want to fight for us. Cyrus is advancing, and will help us. -They have lost their faith in the cause. They're afraid, and they have no desire to fight any longer. -They'll get their courage back when they're sure that Cyrus is on his way. If anything should happen to me, Licardio, you must carry out my plan. Now listen carefully. -Forward! -So you are punctual in keeping an appointment. I was quite sure of it. We were expecting you, Nippur. -You'll pay with your life for your stupid treachery. -Your end is near, Balthazar. Raise the gates! Go on! Move! Go on! -Out Well, aren't you happy now? We've put you close together. -You dirty swine. But we'll meet another time, you coward! -Yes, of course. We'll meet at your funeral pyre. -My dear Nippur. You do love me. -Today I'll make sure that traitor disappears off the face of this Earth. -Don't always try to rush things, Balthazar. Wait this once, at least. I think it would be better that Nippur, before he dies, watches his beloved eaten by the flames of Ishtar. He's got to suffer. Implore pity. -Leave him alive until the next sacrificial rites? That's too good for him. -But if you kill him at once, you'll cause him to suffer too initial for all he's done to you. Why are you in such a hurry, Balthazar? What are you afraid of? -I'm not afraid of anyone, and least of all King Cyrus, who will be defeated long before he gets anywhere near the gates of Babylon. -Great King Balthazar, the advance forces of King Cyrus are gathered before the walls. The surrounding hills are taken by the Persians. We just had time to fall back into the city. -Then let him come, King Cyrus! So that we can see how he and his Persians will fly from the gates of Babylon. But before that, I will offer him an entertaining exhibition. Ha. [SCREAMING] -No! -You weren't expecting such a touching spectacle, were you, Cyrus? You are responsible for it! If you insist on trying to free these prisoners of war, you'll bring about their total destruction. I swear that every day, thousands of these wretched dogs will be crucified, hanged by their necks, and savagely tortured. On these walls, right before your eyes, to the last man and woman. Return to Persia, King Cyrus, if you want to save their lives and yours! -Balthazar, I refuse to surrender to such viciously cruel threats. You're incapable of shedding so much innocent blood. -I will let you drown in this innocent blood. Right here, right before these great walls of Babylon. -Get them out of here! Go on! Get out! Get up, you! Outside! -Soon we'll be killed like the others. -We can't stay here. Pass out new orders at once. We'll break camp this very night. -Come forward for new orders! I -Last night I had a very strange dream about a winged lion. He flew down and attacked an eagle, and tore it to pieces. -That was a symbol of your great strength, Balthazar. -You, of course, are the winged lion. -And Cyrus is the eagle torn into pieces. -Why can't those miserable idiots just die quietly without disturbing our pleasure? -Perhaps, Balthazar, if you only ordered a more violent torture-- -That would be much too good for those treacherous beasts. You, musicians, come and play louder! -If we used a quicker system of torture, they'd die, and we'd lose the fun of hearing them scream! -King Balthazar, I have welcome news for you. King Cyrus has started to break his camp. He's withdrawing his troops. -That was the meaning of the winged lion and the eagle torn to pieces. -Long live Balthazar, invincible king of Babylon! -We shall sacrifice immediately in gratitude to the great and powerful goddess Ishtar. Let us go and watch the eagle in full flight, Ura. -That you'll soon tear into small pieces. -Certainly, Ura. -That's the Signal for the sacrifice. -The signal for the sacrifice in the temple. Wake up. Wake up, all of you! Hurry! Hurry, get up! They're ready for the sacrifice. -What do you say? Should we try it? -We've got to make haste. And may the gods be on our side. -I'll call on my Every one of you, try to recruit more men. -Where is our meeting place? -Right at the main gate. Come on, we must hurry! -Licardio, what about me? -You'll find out soon enough what has happened to us. If we should all be killed, try to get away to a safe place. -I want to come along with you, Licardio. I'm only a woman, but I can be useful. -You've already done much for us. Why do you insist on sacrificing your young life? By following me, it is very probable that you will be killed. -Perhaps it's better. What kind of life is this? Your sacred cause has become mine. Do let me follow you. I beg you. -Very well. Follow me. -Go get her some some wine. I want to drink to Cyrus, who's running like a rabbit. -I'll get it. It's time we had a drink. It'll warm us up. -No! -Come on! -No! -Stop struggling! -No! No! -He can't help you! Now, don't scream. It won't do you any good. -No! -You cowards! -Stop! -Get her! -No! No! -Tamira! Tamira! -Come on! Move along! Move along, I say! TAMIRA: No! -Come on, Nippur. Try harder, Nippur! Harder, Nippur. Harder! Nippur, come and free me, too. -Me, too, Nippur. Come on. -Come on! You've nearly done it! Hurry, Nippur! -Nippur, help me now! -Nippur, over here! -Quiet, or we'll be discovered. -Help me now. -Now me. Hurry, Nippur! Hurry! Hurry! They're coming back! -The guards! The guards! -Through there! -Hurry! Quickly! We've got to get through before the rest of the guards come! Everyone together! -That's it. -The first one. -No! [SCREAMING] -Nippur! Nippur! Save us, Nippur! -Put your back into it. Just a little more. Little higher. -Come on! -Hey, get out of the way. -Why so fast? -Give it here. I want to drink a toast, too. Down with King Cyrus. -More power to his legs. He'll need it to run all the way back to Persia. -I'll double my wager. -You'll be sorry. -Cyrus, I'm quite sure that Nippur's betrayed us. -That's impossible for me to believe. I brought him up in my house. He was part of my family. Perhaps they've imprisoned him. Or they may have killed him. -Cyrus, I've given orders to set up camp on the other side of the river. -Look over there. -Go at once to the forward units, and tell them to maintain their positions and wait for further orders. The rear guard cavalry must turn and make for Babylon at full gallop. Follow me. -Help us! Nippur! Nippur! Help us! -The last one. -Nippur! Nippur! Where are you, Nippur? No! No! Nippur! Help me! No! Let me go! No! Nippur! -Go and seize him! Seize him, I say! -No! No! -Ura! -No! -The end has come to your evil and vicious plot! [SCREAM] -The Persians -The Persians are coming! -The Persians! -Kill all of them! Kill the miserable traitors! -The Persians! The Persians! -The Persians! -That's the way, Nippur. [SHOUTING] -Be seated, Nippur. Now take your well earned place as the true and only king of Babylon. May you be guided by the generosity, the loyalty, and bravery you have shown until this happy day. -King Nippur, the tribes you have saved request permission to return to their own lands. -I give them my permission to go. And may the gods go with you. Tamira! [MUSIC PLAYING]
