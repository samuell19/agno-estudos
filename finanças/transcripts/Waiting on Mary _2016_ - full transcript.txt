I can't believe we're doing this. Sir Nathaniel! This is insane. How long do we have? Long enough. Sir Benjamin! Have you seen Sir Nathaniel? Uh... oh, uh... uh... Uh... Methinks I saw him at the quartermaster's lodging, by the stables and the... just... Near the livery. Ah, I see. Carry on. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hear, ye, hear, ye. Please note that Paul Revere's pony rides are still closed, and the next showing of "Young Jefferson in Love" will commence in 15 minutes... Nathaniel Harrison. A word. Colonel Pennington. Nathaniel, when a bear is hungry, he seeks food. When there is no food, the bear tracks and eats a man. There is no more food, Nathaniel. As such, I regret to inform you that your services are no longer required. Look, Nathan, you're a nice guy, but we've had some cutbacks. Park's not doing great. Mark. Your final compensation will arrive via post in two weeks' time. You've been loyal, Nathan. The entire community of Jamestown Park appreciates your service. Ah, ta. Shh, shh. Mm. Shh. Ah. Hi, you've reached Mary. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm off living life and having adventures, but... Oh. Oh, shit! Hey, man. Nathan... Look, man, I, uh... hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I don't usually do this. Hey, can I grab my jacket? It's just right there, just... I'll get it later. Nathan, I-I messed up. You know I... I didn't think... I wasn't thinking. It just happened. We weren't... I should've told you about Jason. I was planning on it, but it just... it never seemed like the right time, and... And you and I haven't been what we were... For a really long time. Nathan, we need a divorce... Watch out, Columbus! Nathan? Oh! Nathan! Oh! Are you all right? Oh, you look awful. Harrison... Oh, let's get you home. Whom do I thank for the shelter? Oh, morning, Nathan. My name is Nathaniel. Oh. Nathaniel. Yeah, sorry. I remember you. You're a liaison for Jamestown Park. Vivian, was it? Oh, and if I recall correctly, I see Robert over there. Greetings, Robert! Are you angry with that device? Well, it-it just takes forever to heat up, and then when it finally does, it burns everything in it. I keep talking about it, but it never gets fixed! You know, those motorized carriages you have here are quite dangerous. I was nearly hit by one during one of my strolls. Oh, well, I'm just glad you're all right. People drive like maniacs. I'll be sure to look both ways from now on, I can tell you that. May I assist you, Robert? It's just a blown bulb. I can handle it. He just wants to get that lamp fixed before lunch, that's all. I know, why don't you go to your room and relax, and we'll call you when lunch is ready. You all have been most kind with providing me a safe haven during my mission. I just wish to help as much as possible. Oh, don't mention it. Just go and relax, and we'll take care of everything, all right? Damn it! A stupendous meal, Vivian. Well, I didn't make it, but thank you. Regardless, an admirable choice. So, Nathaniel. What have you been up to? Researching this new colony of yours. I am still astonished at the level of technology. A machine that washes your clothes without hands. Motorized carriages without horses. It is very progressive, I must say. Well, that sounds like fun. How long have the two of you resided here? Oh, I don't know. How long has it been, Robert? Seven years. Interesting. An early start to the cause. I must say, the both of you have done a splendid job at assimilating. I-I appreciate having you at my side. You are very dedicated to the cause. I can tell. Your father... Robert and I were talking, and-and I don't want this to seem too intrusive, but how would you feel about seeing someone every day to talk to for a while? You know, someone who can help? Someone to confide in, you mean? A priest? I-I must confess, I have never been the best churchgoer. I feel as though our cultural differences would get in the way of my research. A cultural ambassador. Someone who can help you with your research. Vivian's right. It might help, you know, to work out your... Whatever's going on here. That is a brilliant idea. I can enhance my cultural research by speaking with the cultural ambassador. Have you made the proper connections? As a matter of fact, I have. I've scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow with Dr. Zimmer. Oh, you're going to love him. Hear, hear. Yeah. Huh? To the progress of our colony. You know, it would be especially difficult to cultivate land like this. What is this exactly? That's a Zen garden. It's supposed to put you in a relaxed state of mind. Yes. I can feel it. I have so many questions. Where shall I begin? I understand you're an observer here to our society. Of sorts. I have been sent by the great colony of Jamestown Park to scout your new colony for ways to progress ours. The "Mary." The most exquisite ship you can imagine. Its white sails streak so high, it is as if they are kissing the sun. It is scheduled to arrive soon. I have much to do before then. This new colony is just so... progressive. Did you know that there is a miniature theater you hang on your wall? It's flat but has the most infinite depth, and it displays the most elaborate plays that I have ever seen. At this point, I've-I've learned to be open to anything. Very few things scare me. What are they? The Redcoats. Is he all right? I mean, is he gonna get any worse? Do I need to look into any hospitals? Oh, I can't stand the thought of my baby being put into one of those hospitals. Oh, I've heard such sad stories. I mean, people die in there! Please take a deep breath, Mrs. Jacobs. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm calm. I'm sorry. Your son is going through a dramatic struggle right now, and he's being... consumed by this character. I tried to raise him right, but Robert was always at work, and then I had my shop at night. I have to admit, it's one of the more unusual cases that I've seen, but we all go through it in some ways. Our best course of action is to let him continue in this fantasy of his but gradually try to guide him back. Why can't we just snap him out of it? I mean, it's so scary. He's got to come to this on his own. I cannot stress that enough. We can hint or suggest, but it has to be his idea. We have to work together on this, okay? Thank you for arranging the meeting today. He was a fine authority. Aren't you coming home? I have yet to complete my observations for today. Are you sure? I mean, one day won't set you back. I apologize, but I must insist on completing my work. All right. I'll see you later, Nathaniel. Oh! Before I forget. This came in the mail for you. Ah. My much anticipated stipend. Much obliged. Just watch out for cars and everything. See you at dusk. Hey there. Oh. Afternoon. Nice hat. Much obliged. Are you a method actor or something? No. I am here under orders of Colonel Pennington of Jamestown Park. It's nice to meet you, Nathaniel. My name's Allison. Pleasure to meet you. How cordial of you. May I ask how you knew my name? - Your name tag? - Oh. You're really out there, aren't you? Out... where? Mm, hey, I hope this isn't too weird, but would you mind if I took a couple pictures of you? What is a picture? It's like an instant painting. With that? Yes. Pretty please? Well, I suppose. Anything for a beautiful lady. Thanks. All right, Nathaniel. Strike a pose. Now let's try a smiling one. Well, I don't think that's appropriate for a picture painting. Come on. Please? - Yes? - Yeah. Perfect. Now, look at me. These are great. Thank you so much, Nathaniel. May I ask what they'll be used for? It's part of a collection I do. I like to take pictures that capture life. Ah. An artist. How delightful. Glad you think so. I have to go, but maybe I'll see you around, Nathaniel. Ah. Redcoat. Hey, there. I'm Kelly. Are you here for the class? Yes. Nice outfit, by the way. Very authentic. Thank you. Yes. This is... what I wear. I've worn my fair share of costumes. Usually, I'll go with a superhero or an anime character, but I really want to do something from video games, but everyone keeps telling me there are no good female characters in video games, but I'm like, "Of course there are good female characters." Yes. Yes. Yes. What are you writing? Nothing. Nothing at all. You can't write nothing, silly pants. It's... official documents. Oh, staying in character? Cool. Thank you all for coming. Mm, who will be first? Garrett, you first. - Steven. - Are you ready? For the revenge of my father, I will strike thee down with the force of a thousand cannons. Your father was a liar and a scoundrel. He deserved everything he got. - And so do you. - Ugh! Next? Redcoat. A fine outfit you wear, sir, but as a juxtaposition to your treachery. Say no more. You may have been able to fool this colony... But I know who you are. And you, sir. A slap to the face of our good king. Lay down your weapon, and surrender. I shall never surrender to a Redcoat. Then you may die with honor. When he shoots, you're supposed to fall. It's part of the exercise. I shall never fall at the feet of the weak. Leave this colony be. Okay. I think we got it. Next, please? I will not be dismissed. This man is a danger to your home, your children, and your freedom. Good evening. I'm Debra Waters. I'm standing here in front of Studio 620 in downtown St. Petersburg, where words and ideas come to life. Surrender, or I shall fire. Okay. All right, that was really good. You should come back this week. Hey! Guys, stop it! This guy's crazy! They hold weekly improvisational classes for acting students in the Bay Area. Oh, here are some now. Excuse me. Would you like to comment? Are you making a picture painting? Yes, we're live. Oh, impressive. So tell me about your improvisational sessions. Improvisational sessions? That man is a danger to the welfare of your children and your freedom. - Ooh, intense. - Nathan? How did you find out about Studio 620? How long have you been in the... I'm Debra Waters. Back to you. Evening, barkeep. May I have a pint of your finest ale? Sure thing, pal. You want to start a tab? Hmm? Do you want to open a bill for more drinks? Ah. No. Seven dollars. Of course. You see this man? When I stepped off the "Mary," he was waiting for me. Very fine fellow. Whatever you say, pal. Is everything all right? What's up with your outfit? Is there some sort of... reenactment in town or something? No. This is traditional clothing where I am from. Everyone wears this. It must be a pretty fruity place. Oh, I'm sure I do not know what you mean. Oh... I was just fucking with you. You ask me, a man can wear whatever the hell he wants. - I appreciate that. - Sure. I don't need no crazy wife telling me what the hell I should want to wear. I'll fucking wear pantyhose with cotton balls stuck to it if I want to. Rodney Jones. Former pest exterminator and number one hot dog eating champion three years running. Nathaniel Harrison of Jamestown Park. Apologies. Haven't been getting enough sleep? Hardly. I don't intend to be rude here, but are we... are we done for the day? I have quite a bit of work to do. Nathaniel. You want to play a game? It involves a paper bag and this. I'm afraid I do not follow you, Ambassador. Think of a memory. Imagine it as a rock. Toss the rock into the bag, and share it. What a peculiar custom. I-I should write this down. Oh, no. Don't worry about that. Just try it. Do you have a rock? Here. Take mine. You're quite unusual, Ambassador. Just throw it. What witchcraft is that? It's not witchcraft, Nathaniel. You know, the mind is a powerful thing. We were talking about... the "Mary." It still coming? Of course. Must have been a long time. You miss your family? My family? Well... yes, I-I'm sure they are well. They understand that... situation with my duty. And what is the nature of this duty? Taking notes. Trying to understand this culture, and... You can never underestimate people. You never know who you can trust. You write all this information? You put it down in your journal? Impressive. Yes, I do. That name tag... This is how we identify ourselves. Surely, you have a similar way of identification? We have driver's license and ID cards, but that's most unusual. Not what we typically think of as colonial attire. Different customs, I suppose. Yes. Hmm, that must be it. That's enough for now, but I do have a little homework assignment for you, though. ♪ Pretty ladies ♪ That's what I want right now ♪ Pretty ladies ♪ I want one right now I met a lovely young woman the other day. I was hoping we would cross paths again. You didn't scare her away with her outfit? I told you this is customary where I am from. I'm just fucking with you. What's her name? - Allison. - Allison, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Is she seeing anybody? That, I do not know. Either way, you should try and hit that. I would never hit a woman. Besides, I'm not a wealthy man. I will not be able to afford a dowry for the likes of hers. Are you fucking kidding me? This is America, son. Things don't work like that. You got to be straight with her. You got to let her decide. That's how I met my ex-wife. What do you mean? You got to work for things, Nathaniel. You got to want it. I walked right up to her, and I said... "Hey. "I like your bod. What do you say?" What did she say? She was kind of scared. And then her boyfriend attacked me, and I hit him with a mug, and he bobbed back and forth like a limp dick until he passed out. Then I had to apologize to her and fill out some police paperwork, but I won her over in the end. One night, we got so drunk, we did it right in my old pest control van. Next thing you know? Rodney, Jr. Shit. That sounds awful, my friend. Yeah, it wasn't so good. I really do wish to see her again. Why don't you go back to where you met her? Hang around. Maybe she'll show up. You are very wise, Rodney. Surely, your current occupation is one of stature. What do you do? I drink. You drink? I guess you can say I work for the government. Welfare. - Hi, Nathaniel. - For goodness' sake. - Got you. - Yes. Are you still taking your picture paintings? Yes... I was wondering if I was ever gonna see you again. How's mine coming along? Very well. Would you like to walk with me? - That would be lovely. - Cool. So, I was thinking, since you were such a great model, that you could be the centerpiece in my next gallery, like a character piece, showing how you live from day to day. That sounds interesting. However, I have a tight schedule to adhere to. Come on. Much like you have your projects, I have a project of my own. Oh, yeah? Believe it or not, I hold a high honor with my own colony. I have a close relation with the admiralty. Well, how about this? I'll meet you halfway. If you let me take pictures of you, I'll drive you anywhere you need. You own your own motor carriage? I guess I do. So what do you say? It's a generous offer. However... - Come on! Every great explorer had a guide. I know this place pretty well. I've only been here a year, but I'm planning on staying. From where did you travel? From New York, and then LA. Oh, everybody moves out there with the same big dreams, becoming a great artist, changing the world. For most people, it's, like, not about the meaning. It's so cutthroat. Anyways, I got burnt out. I just want to be happy. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That's what my colony was founded on. Well, that's why I started my own studio. Do you want to see some of my work? I really like this guy. It-It's a frog. Interesting. Thanks. My parents... think... differently. They would prefer that I go back to law school. Well, I think it's admirable. Or selfish. All right. Stop by the studio. I'd love to show you my work. I will do just that. There's a schoolhouse that has seen better days. Built nicely, but the paint is flaking off the wood. Our blacksmith, John, owns an old forge. He has just one fire pit, but he still puts out an impressive display of goods. Is the forge nearby to the school? It's practically next door. Everything in our colony is this way. The school is by the south gate furthest from the entrance, and there's the forge, the governor's estate, the stables, and the barracks. You know, Nathan, that reminds me of a field trip I used to take when I was a kid in school. I forget the name, but it was a small theme park. I swear it was laid out like just the one you've talked about. Well, from a practical standpoint, I don't see why more colonies aren't. Smithson Park? No. That wasn't it. No. Jamestown Park. Oh, well. It'll come to me. Yeah. So you like it? Very much. It brings out a different side of me. Great. I love it. I think it's gonna be the main piece of the show. - Really? - Only if you're okay with it. Well, I-I suppose so. Great. I really want you to be there. I think it's gonna be awesome. I shall make the time. I'm so excited. My apologies. I do not wish to be late for dinner. I must go. Oh. Sure. Excuse me, young man, what is it you're doing there? Hey! You better run, you pervert. You better run! I apologize! Nathaniel. You missed dinner. Apologies. I just jogged a considerable distance. I'm afraid... I will have to turn in. Good night. Morning, Nathaniel. Good morning. I must have dozed off quite late today. I didn't want to wake you. I made breakfast. You want some? That'd be delightful. Where's Robert? - Robert is at work. - Oh. So, what have you been up to? I've been having the most enjoyable time with a woman named Allison. Allison, huh? That sounds so precious. She's very supportive of my duty. She even offered to escort me in her moving carriage. Really? Yes. She's an artist. She works with images from life and transforms them into something really... special. I've agreed to be the subject of her next gallery. What? Yes. It's quite an honor. Well, do you think that's a good idea? Why not? Well... I don't know. I mean, well, if you're a representative of your colony, I mean, don't you have to portray a good image? Of course. People need to know I can be trusted. Well, then you can't have your face mocked and hanged for everyone to see. I mean, I don't think it's a good idea, considering your duty to our colony. Nathaniel. Do you remember yesterday that theme park I was thinking about? I do. I brought some pictures. Would you like to see them? I suppose. Well, let's see here. Look familiar? This is of that schoolhouse I said reminded me of your colony. Remarkable similarity. How about this? Where did you get these? This is strange. It is, isn't it? That's a... a remarkable likeness. Nathan, is that you? You are not an ambassador, are you? Of course I am. No. No. You are working for the enemy. You are working with the Redcoats. I'm not a spy. Nathan, do you know the woman in this picture? My name is Nathaniel! Nathaniel, wait. Sometimes, when we get hurt, really hurt, we create mental bandages, ways to deal with the pain. I know I have them. What if I told you Nathaniel Harrison is your mental bandage? I cannot believe this betrayal. I am Nathaniel Harrison of Jamestown Park, and you, sir, are working for the enemy. Nathan, I messed up. You know, I... and you and I have... I didn't think... For a really... long time. Hyah! Hyah! Yah! Yah! Giddyup. Giddyup. Hyah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Giddyup. Giddyup. Hyah! Hyah! Yah! Shit, man! You nearly killed me. So sorry! Rodney! Oh, I'm-I'm fairly new to this device. It's all right. When'd you get a bike? Is that what this is called? - Huh? - Huh. Rodney, why does your garment resemble a carrot? Well, after our last talk, I got thinking, I need to get back on the horse, get a job, make something of myself. You've been doing great things with welfare. Oh, I need more than that. Plus, the ex-wife's clamoring for more money. This smoothie place is the best I can get right now, but it's a start, hey? I got to get people's attention! Hey! Got to get those health nuts in the door and sucking down our smoothies. Well, I'm very happy to see the change of character. Thanks, buddy. Oh, so what are you doing? Well, I had intended on calling on Allison, but I've been unable to. She... She... She gave me this. That's her? Right. Just call her. You can use my phone. You have a vocal projector? Yeah, I swiped it from my manager. - Hello? - Hello, Allison? Nathan? I thought you had an appointment. I-I-I did, but I-I need to speak with you. This is so strange. I can hear you, but I can't see you. Where are you? I'm with my friend Rodney. - Hi! - Rodney says hi. I need to see you, if possible. Do you want to meet in the park, and we can go exploring? I'll see you there shortly. I just have to finish this up. I'll see you soon. Didn't I tell you she liked you? Yeah! - Huh? - Mm. Hey, Ben Franklin, where's your kite? Oh, I-I'm not Ben Franklin. Hey, he's not Ben Franklin, all right? Hey, shut up, Carrot Top. He looks like Ben Franklin, so I'm gonna call him Ben Franklin. You take that back. It's a free country, isn't it? Ben Franklin should be able to tell you all about that, can't you, Ben? - Not Ben Franklin, shithole. - Rodney. Hey, fuck you, carrot cake. I'll kick your ass. Hey! Hey! Hey! What's going on here? Rodney, we talked about this! I'm calling the cops! Where's my phone? How you holding up? You ever wonder if you are who you think you are? All the time. Growing up, I used to want to be like my parents. Hardworking, responsible lawyer type. Look at me now. I'm none of those. Don't get caught up in it. Just be who you are in this moment. I think we all figure it out eventually. Let's go have some fun. What's wrong? I do not wish to eat a dog. It's not a dog, Nathaniel. Isn't it a sausage dog? No. I don't know what exactly it is, but it's definitely not a dog. And it's American. Oh, right. Your literary selection is quite extensive. Have you read all of them? Hmm, no. But I'll let you know when I do. Please do. Ships make port here? Some ones, yeah. Smile. Sorry. The flash was on. You okay? Yes. I feel as though I just stared into the sun. I'm sorry. This is where my ship will dock when it completes its journey. - The "Mary"? - Of course. It's a long voyage, you know. I wait here every day at this exact spot for when it arrives. How do you know it'll be right here? I mean, what if it gets lost? Only the finest captains take command of the "Mary." It will not get lost. May I ask you a question? Certainly. What if it never comes? Do not say that. But what if? I do not discuss things that will never happen. Okay. I apologize. But it will arrive. Whoa, look at this bad boy. Allison. Are you engaged to wed? Yeah. He surprised me the other night. Right in front of the whole family at dinner. I mean, what was I supposed to say? You do not wish to marry him? I mean, I don't know. I like him. But we're both so different. I always thought I'd be with someone more fun. Everything's always business and planning. You, Nathaniel, you're fun. Really, I mean it. Anyways. It is what it is. We should head back. Sorry. One second, Nathan. Certainly. Speak of the devil. Yeah? I'm just finishing up with Nathan. Dinner? Yeah, that sounds good. I'll ask him. Nathaniel, would you like to join us for dinner? Derek would really like to meet you. I would not want to intrude. Not at all. We want you to be there. All right. We'll see you there. It really is great to meet you. She's told me a lot about you. And you as well. Allison has spoken very highly of you. Really? I thought she'd forgotten all about me, what with all your photo sessions. I'm gonna use the ladies' room. You guys stay here, talk about men things. - Want me to order for you? - No, I'll be right back. How do you like your beer? Oh, it's... intoxicating. Good choice. Good man. Real men drink dark beer. So, you're from out of town? I am here under work orders. Where from exactly? The great colony of Jamestown Park. Really? I'm not familiar with that area. Does everyone dress like they're off their trolley? I am unfamiliar with that term. But yes, we all dress like this. Yeah. Drop the act. I know what you're up to. Apologies. I-I don't follow. This. Look, I just want to know what's going on. Allison's seen you every day. I don't see her every day. Clearly, it's some kind of extravagant ruse to get in her pants. I would never! I'm just saying. Consider this a friendly warning. I protect what's mine. Hey! She's back! You guys look very serious. I was just explaining to Nathaniel what it takes to be a television reporter. Can never miss a thing. Always on your toes. Cool. Nathan. I was thinking of holding my gallery next Saturday. What do you think? How could you say no to that face? You could get famous. I suppose it's true. I really think this gallery's going to open people's eyes, make them feel connected to another person, no matter how strange or special they are. To be able to view... Derek, we're at dinner. Sorry, darling. Station's ratings are down. I'm on call. Yello? This is a lovely restaurant. I'm glad you think so. Good morning. How's the day? Jesus. - Apologies. - Nathaniel. I'm fine, and yourself? Quite jovial, thank you. You've been staying out pretty late. Allison wanted to introduce her fiancé to me and discuss her exhibit. That's great, Nathaniel. Have you thought any more about what we discussed? What do you mean? Well, I think it's nice that you're having such a good time with this girl, but I think it would be better if you kept it under the radar, for the betterment of our colony and your political standpoint and everything. Poppycock. Allison would never betray me. No. I shall hear no more of this. Ben Franklin, what's up? Ben Franklin! Nathaniel. The star of the gallery's here. - Hello, Allison. Come on in. I got something to show you. Which one do you like the best? Is everyone dressed like they're off their trolley? Can't have your face mocked and hanged for everyone to see. Nathan, is that you? Is everything okay? Allison... I have a bit of bad news for you. You cannot feature me in your gallery. What? It's not that I don't find you talented, I... All of these pieces... it's just that I cannot compromise my position here as a representative of Jamestown Park. - What? - I hope you understand. I appreciate you showing me around, and I-I hope we can still keep each other company. Just get out. - Allison. - Leave. Hello? - Mrs. Jacobs? - Yes? This is Dr. Zimmer. Oh. How is Nathan? That's what I wanted to talk about. He didn't show up today. What do you mean? I'm afraid I scared him away. What did you do? I showed him some pictures I found of Jamestown Park. One of Mary. I don't know what to do. I mean, this has been going on for so long. I thought we were there, but clearly he needs more time. Did the pictures make him worse? I wouldn't say worse. He just... he's just trying to resolve some problems in his own way. We can't do what we think is right for him. This is bullshit! What are we paying you for? Allison. Where are you? You weren't at the house, and today's been a nightmare. All right. What did I do? He said I can't use them. He changed his mind. Really? Did he say why? He said it compromised his mission. Maybe he's right. I didn't want to exploit him. I wanted to celebrate him. What do you mean, his mission? Nathan believes everything he says. - You mean it's not an act? - No. He's like that all the time. You know, there's still a way you can show your photos to the world. How? If it was a news story. The laws are a lot more lenient. We can still celebrate him. She hates me. What'd you do, you idiot? I asked her not to use my photos in her gallery. How'd she take it? Not well. The hell with it. We're gonna get you so drunk, you won't even care. Keep 'em coming like Niagara Falls. Ha-ha! Son of a bitch. I knew you had it in you! You're great! Let's sing a song, huh? ♪ Yankee Doodle went to town ♪ Riding on a pony ♪ Stuck a feather in his hat ♪ And called it macaroni ♪ Yankee Doodle, keep it up ♪ Yankee Doodle dandy ♪ Mind the music and the step ♪ And with the girls be handy This may look like a normal residence, but the family that lives inside has a dark secret: a mentally ill man with a delusion that he's from the 18th century. He was nice enough, but he seemed pretty weird. He tried to kidnap my son! He kept yelling at me, and when I didn't respond, he attacked me. - I do not know them. - I had to hold him back. The truth came out about Nathaniel Harrison when I did a little digging into his actual background. His real name is Nathan Jacobs, a recently terminated employee from the bankrupt theme park called Jamestown Park, here in St. Petersburg. I reached out to Nathan for comment but was declined an interview, but if this man really is suffering from deep mental issues, the real question is, how safe can we be with him roaming the streets? For Channel 2 News, I'm Derek Williams. Back to you. How can they say such things? I am not mentally ill. Fucking media spinmasters. I need to get home. Oh! Oh. I am well. I am well. Are you sure? You almost busted some serious ass there. Yes. All right. You have any problems, you call me. I am a man. Fuckin' right! Say it again. I am... a man. God damn it, that sounds good. Robert? Vivian? Nathan, why are you here? I have some questions to ask you... Nathan, hi. How are you? What's going on? Mary here just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing. Huh? What? How's it going, Nathan? Colonel. Your disguise is impeccable. It's Mark, Nathan. Park's closed. IRS shut us down. Turns out we weren't even that historically accurate. I feel like this is all my fault. I was too hard on you. Your wife and I decided to stop by to show some support. Mm. Wife? I do not know this woman. How can you say that? Vivian called to fill me in, and I came over as soon as I heard. And I'm here to talk or whatever you need. Nathan, you still haven't signed the divorce papers, and I'm moving into a different stage in my life, and I think that you should too. You owe it to yourself. I want to help you. Help me? There is nothing wrong with me. Do you think I am dangerous as well? What about you? Robert? Vivian? Nathan, calm down. You were supposed to be my liaisons. As for you, Colonel Pennington, I'll report you to the council. You'll be hanged for treason. God damn it, Nathan, we are not going to do this anymore. We have been playing along with this fantasy of yours, but we are done. We're your parents, for Christ's sake! Great. The maggots are back. It's boiling. Is everyone here mad? I apologize, but I do not know you. Nathan, I'm sorry for what I did, but we were on different paths. My name is Nathaniel! You can still start fresh, Nathan. I do not know you, and you do not know me! Nathan, it's not real. We have to deal with this! Honey! Are you all right? I apologize. Am I shining? Let's go. Go, go. Nathan. Nathan. The people deserve to hear your side of the story. Do you understand? If you grant me a personal interview, we'll clear all this up. No, Nathan! Nathan! Cut. We'll get him later. Damn it, Derek. What is your relationship with Nathan? Can you give us a comment about his mental wellbeing? Look at all the exposure we're getting. Isn't it great? Can you go on the record and please give us a comment? Do you mind? That's my fiancée. Allison, honey, what's wrong? This is good for us. You goddamn reporters can't be on my property like this. This is trespassing. I'll call the police. I'm not a reporter. I'm Nathan's friend Allison. - Who? I'm Allison. I'm the photographer. Are you that girl he's been seeing? - Wait, what was that? - Sort of. I'm sorry to bother you, but I really need to speak with Nathan. Nathan's not here, but come in. - Thank you. - Allison! Oh, fuck. What happened? You should know by now that my son isn't well. His mother had the bright idea of having his ex-wife over to surprise him. It didn't go well. I can imagine. We built this together, him and I. - The ship. - Yeah. One day he was playing, knocked it over, broke this piece off. I put it away thinking I'd fix it later. Guess life just took over. I felt like I knew who he was then. Now I don't know who he is. He's your son, and he's a good person. We're gonna bring 'er right over to ya! Nathan, are you okay? Let me call an ambulance. I'm fine. Fine. I'm fine. I know about Mary. I don't know who I am anymore. But I want to find out. I'm sorry about what happened. Needless to say, the engagement's off. Good. I mean, I'm sorry. But good. We've all heard that life has an ebb and flow. We move about like zombies, taking the bad with the good without question, always hoping that good is just around the corner. We've all been living a lie. I found a way to get rid of the ebb, transforming my own life into a perpetual flow, a constant rush of good and positivity. Now, you're not gonna get there today, no matter how much I try to help, but I can get you started on the right path. Repeat after me. I am a man. I am a man. Damn, that sounds good. Hello, this is Vivian's, Nathan's mother, and I called first of all to apologize for the last time I believe we spoke on the phone. I was less than polite, and I think I have some words that I would like to take back and apologize for, and most of all, I want to thank you and let you know that Nathan is doing so much better. But what does it mean? It means we are no longer children. No longer boys. No longer girls. No more sitting around waiting for the adults to make decisions... we are the adults now. We are masters of our fate. I just hope to be able to change lives how I changed mine. I have a friend who started me on this journey. He reminded me that it's never too late to discover who you are.
