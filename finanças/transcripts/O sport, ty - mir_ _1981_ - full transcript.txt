OLYMPIAD 1980 PRODUCTION STUDIO Olympiad! OH, SPORT, YOU ARE PEACE! There are many beautiful legends about the origin of the Olympic Games. According to one of the earliest, internal wars raged in Greece in the ninth century BCE. To stop the bloodshed, Iphitos, the ruler of Olympia, founded the Olympic Games and decreed: "Henceforth, all warfare is to cease during the games. Whosoever bares a sword in Olympia shall be punished." This celebration of peace attracted, even against their masters' wishes, those who were once enemies. They would make peace and take part in athletic competition. Together with the athletes, the Greek elite would attend the games: the famous orator Demosthenes... the renowned mathematician Pythagoras... even the hermit-philosopher Diogenes. Poets and musicians, actors and artists performed here. The poet of Olympia, Pindar praised the games in his odes. "Look for no star warmer than the sun, Shining down by day through the lonely sky, Let us proclaim no contest greater than the Olympic Games." Millennia have passed. Olympia, land shrouded in legend, the ancient land of Hellas. Every four years, per age-old tradition, the high priestess of Hera's Temple, using the light of the sun, ignites the sacred Olympic flame. For the past 16 years, the role of the priestess has been played by lovely Greek actress Maria Moscholiou. 5,000 athletes, by relay, running day and night across Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, across the Soviet Union, have brought the sacred Olympic flame to Moscow, the capital of the Olympics.

The Olympics is a dream where people from all five continents of our planet, join hands just as tightly and live in peace under the clear blue sky. Moscow welcomes the guests. Olympic attendees have brought cameras, horses, boats, bikes, swords, boxing gloves, and great hopes. VENEZUELAN DELEGATION Moscow, July 19, 1980. Please welcome to the Opening Ceremony of the 22nd Olympiad... the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev. This celebratory procession of grand chariots is our tribute to the ancient land of Hellas, our tribute to sports, which are noble and unbound by any borders, and to the beautiful and immortal spirit of the Olympiad. I salute you Most peaceful ground on earth Stadium of my dreams Dedication is the path to victory There are no sports without beauty Yearning for triumph Yearning for a record And the glorious moment of struggle The masters of these grand sports Exemplify chivalry to others FASTER, HIGHER, STRONGER I salute you, stadium Where dreams compete I salute you, stadium Where new records are set We are given this world of sunny joy Sports are born out of courage And the stadium is made for victories This noble ideal of the Olympic Games draws to Moscow over 6,000 of the finest athletes from every continent in the world. INDIA ITALIAN NATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE The path to Moscow has not been easy for the delegations of some nations. The games boycott campaign is to blame. And we must not remain silent about it. International Olympic Academy President, Mr. Schimitzek says, "It is a pity that not all nations are attending this Olympiad. Most likely this is for political reasons, not athletic ones. It goes against Olympic principles. These principles oppose any kind of discrimination, political, religious, racial, any kind of discrimination between people." We asked these American tourists if they regret the fact that no US athletes are at the Olympiad. "Very much so. They'd like it here. They would've made a great contribution. I think they were robbed of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." The International Sports Press Association vice-president, Mr. Miyakawa says, "Watching the Opening Ceremony, I felt that the Japanese athletes should be here. I regret what has happened. I think the Japanese athletes feel the same. This happened not because of athletic principles, but due to political causes." "It is very unfortunate," these West German tourists say, "that our athletes are not participating in this Olympiad. Most of them would've liked to come but they were prohibited." At the microphone, the Chairman of the 1980 Olympiad Organizing Committee, Ignatiy Trofimovich Novikov. I have the honor of introducing Lord Killanin, the president of the International Olympic Committee, whom I welcome sincerely. I would like to welcome all the athletes and officials here today. Especially those who have shown their independence by coming despite the many pressures they faced. I ask you all to compete in these wonderful athletic facilities in the spirit of true cooperation and to rise above political, religious, and racial differences. I am honored to invite President Leonid Brezhnev to declare officially open the 22nd Olympiad of the modern era. Dear President of the International Olympic Committee, athletes of the world, dear guests, comrades, I declare the Olympic Games of 1980, the 22nd Olympiad of the modern era, officially open. OH, SPORT, YOU ARE PEACE! The flame, born of the sun, is ignited in the sea capital of the Olympiad, Tallinn... in the hero city of Minsk... in the hero city of Kiev... in the hero city of Leningrad. Meanwhile, in Moscow, the Olympic mascot, Misha the bear makes an appearance. Sweet and kind, he seems to have sprung from an old Russian fairy tale. He really wants the athletes and guests to like him. And we think he's succeeded. FASTER The 100 meters. In the finals, eight of the fastest women at the Olympiad compete. One of them is the world record holder, Lyudmila Kondratyeva. Lyudmila Kondratyeva is the Olympic champion! The path to the stars is beset with thorns. And so is the path to Olympic glory for the star of the Olympics. Victory is gained in joy, pain, and tears of happiness. Men's 100 meters. On your marks! It's a gold-winning finish for Allan Wells, a Scottish athlete. Linger now, sweet moment, thou art so fair for Allan Wells. He is the first sprinter from Great Britain to become an Olympic champion in 56 years. The sport of running was one of the most venerable in Olympia. The rules of the sacred, age-old tradition were strictly observed. Even the smallest violation was punished immediately. There were cases when the violator caused a change in the rules of the games. At the 14th Olympiad, the young Orsippus lost his clothes in the rush of the race. But he finished first, with a great lead. His victory was so brilliant, and his compatriots' joy so great, that the judges could not deny his victory. After that, all athletes competed naked. There was no greater title in Greece than champion of the Olympic Games. When such a champion would return home, the city wall was broken to symbolize that, upon entering a city, victory would never depart. Time passes. Athletes are getting faster, and faster, and faster. We're counting seconds, tenths, hundredths of a second. Then again, life in general has become more fast-paced. Sebastian Coe, Great Britain: Three minutes, 38.40 seconds. In the 1500 meters, Sebastian Coe has earned the second gold for Great Britain. In long-distance events, the Ethiopian runners exhibit unparalleled tactics with the undefeatable Miruts Yifter at the helm. In the 5,000-meters, Yifter remained in the background, as he often does, and only in the last lap did he perform his victorious run. The 10,000 meters. All the runners have studied Yifter's famous technique, but even so, none can defeat him. It's difficult for Yifter, he's older than most of the others at 36. But this is also an advantage. He is wiser than the others. Sport demands it all: inspiration, talent and wisdom. Probably the most excited to hear of his victories are his six children in Ethiopia. The 110-meter hurdles. Thomas Munkelt from the GDR beats the Cuban hurdler Alejandro Casa?as. Don't get upset, Alejandro. It's not about winning, but participating. 12 meters, 10 meters, eight meters. The 3,000-meter steeplechase. 250 meters. As I suspected. But will he manage? Malinowski has a great run. Five meters, four meters, three meters, two meters. Malinowski attacks. Looks like it's going to be beautiful. He has the lead. May luck be with him. Malinowski is first. Leading by eight, 10, 15 meters. Day after day. For the second time, Poland has not yet perished. He turns around. With elegance, without superiority. Just wanting to check. Bronek, Bronek Malinowski, first gold medal. He wins. Eight minutes, nine seconds. Polish commentator Tomaszewski is excited for good reason: Polish athlete Bronislaw Malinowski is an Olympic champion. Italian sprinter Pietro Mennea. The 200 meters. "Trust in God but do the work," as a Russian saying goes. Attention. And Pietro Mennea definitely did his work today! FASTER, HIGHER, STRONGER! The marathon: 42 kilometers, 195 meters. Take care, starter. Do not fire the pistol too early. Greece, the city of Marathon. Here in 490 BCE, 10,000 Athenians led by the Greek strategos Miltiades, defeated the army of the Persian King Darius. The good news was sent to Athens with the Greek soldier Pheidippides. He ran along this road, crossing hills and small rivers. He ran 42 kilometers, the distance to Athens, which would become known as the "Marathon distance." Pheidippides reached this site where the first Olympic stadium stands, catching his breath, he proclaimed, "Rejoice, we won!" Legend has it that the runner died having finished the marathon. "Maybe not," said Coubertin. "He was happy, and in happiness, there is no death." An electronic device capable of reading minds has yet to be invented. But it would be interesting to know what goes through a runner's mind. Let's say him, Richard Hooper from Ireland. Forty-two kilometers. Forty-two kilometers and 195 meters more. As if 42 kilometers weren't enough. It's during those last 195 meters that you're truly exhausted. I'm not vain. I don't like to put too much pressure on myself, I'm not counting on the Olympic gold. But I have to settle the score with my brother Patrick. See, here he comes, right away. I wonder, had that ancient Greek not run that distance, would there be no marathon? It's so nice to run in the stadium, in front of crowds, with girls watching. Had I run five kilometers, as Mom told me, by now, I'd be showering. Meanwhile, in the triple jump event, decisive developments are taking place. The favorite, Brazilian Jo?o de Oliveira, is the world record holder. The best attempt of the Brazilian champion, 17 meters, 22 centimeters. Young Soviet athlete Jaak Uudm?e is jumping. 17 meters, 35 centimeters. This is a bid for victory. The three-time Olympic champion, Viktor Saneyev goes last. He realizes that this time the odds are stacked against him, his age, he's 35, and injuries. A strong wind blows. Viktor wants to wait, but his 1.5 minutes are ticking away. 17 meters, 24 centimeters. Two centimeters farther than Oliveira. The silver medal. Add this to his three previous golds from Mexico, Munich and Montreal. Twelve Olympic years, what a long athletic life. But he thinks, "What a short athletic life." That's why on the pedestal, Oliveira told the champion, "You've won, but the first among us is Saneyev." Why do I run? What for? How many times have I promised to quit? But last time Patrick beat me. The main thing in marathon running is to be able to persevere. A nosebleed, that's okay. It happens. Olympic champion Waldemar Cierpinski from East Germany is first to finish the arduous marathon. It's over. I came in 38th. That's decent. Many have dropped out, even the famous Lasse Vir?n. And I did not. Where's Patrick? There he is. I'm 38th and he's 42nd. I win. What a great guy he is, my brother Patrick. Now for a different marathon, the cycling road race. One hundred fifteen athletes from 32 countries must complete 189 kilometers, 14 laps. Soviet cyclist Sergei Sukhoruchenkov is first, leading by three minutes. In a few months, many sports reporters will call him the best in the world. The Krylatskoye Olympic Rowing Canal. "This canal is the best in the world," said Finnish champion Pertti Karppinen. The Krylatskoye waters proved most lucky for East Germany's Olympic fleet. This team turned the canal's waters golden with their medals. Eleven gold medals out of14 is quite an accomplishment. In Tallinn, Estonia, the Baltic wind fills the sails of the competition. At the Olympic regatta, teams from 12 nations received awards. Two gold medals were taken by Brazilian yachtsmen, one each for Spain, Denmark, Finland and the Soviet Union. Swimmers from 42 countries took starting positions at the Olympic pool. The 15-year-old Rica Reinisch from the GDR was the true discovery of the Olympics. She set three world records. Englishman Duncan Goodhew got the public's attention right away. He wore his checkered cap even to the pool. Maybe this is a good luck charm for the renowned swimmer? Watch how this likable fellow prepares for competition. Finally, victory comes. Of course, the men's 1500 meters was the focus of the competition. Everyone expected a record from the 20-year-old Vladimir Salnikov. Vladimir Salnikov's lead increases and he sets a phenomenal record of 14 minutes, 58.27 seconds. For the first time, the 15-minute barrier is broken. Salnikov's record will be named the most outstanding of the Moscow games. And he will be recognized as the best athlete in the world. Looking at these swimmers, we can tell that Salnikov's record will not stand for very long. These are the faces of future champions. Remember them. HIGHER The high jump is the most romantic event in track and field. When, against gravitational laws and conventional wisdom, athletes fly and soar over the bar like birds, then the stadiums grow quiet, expecting a miracle. Let us be quiet too and just watch. Track and field is called the queen of sports. It would be more precise to say that it's an entire kingdom. And on this day, its queen was the famous Italian athlete Sara Simeoni. Her rule was uncontested. Sara, as a child you wanted to be a ballet dancer. Even now you probably feel like you are on the stage. The prima donna of international athletics. Since childhood I've dreamed of the heights Since childhood I've been striving for the sky It remains with me always My unyielding song Through dark clouds of concern The smile of dawn will shine One more strike One more attempt The smile of dawn will shine And the light of its heights Until the heights are conquered Dare not stoop down to fear The heights are treacherous They do not surrender easily Through dark clouds of concern The smile of dawn will shine One more strike One more attempt The smile of dawn will shine And the light of its heights Since childhood I've dreamed of the heights And the silver groves of the stars I see the light of other heights And I can hear your soaring voice In this world, what is above the heights? Only love, earthly love Five meters, 78 centimeters. A new world record set by the talented Polish athlete Wladyslaw Kozakiewicz. To the sublime sky, we fly Faster, higher, stronger. Following this motto, man learns about himself. The Olympic Games are a glimpse of the future. The champions and record breakers are scouts, pioneers pushing the limits of human ability. That's why we are so interested in their struggle, uncompromising and honest, and always with an unpredictable result. Prior to the Moscow games, standing champion, Polish Jacek Wszola, was considered by the experts to be a 100% uncontested gold medal candidate. Camera! An athlete from East Germany, Gerd Wessig, was ranked 48th among the world's best jumpers. The experts did not consider him to be a contender. Gerd Wessig is the Olympic champion! The bar is set at an unprecedented height: two meters, 36 centimeters. Fantastic! What a fantastic result! Nevertheless, even this is not the limit. The human desire to reach for the skies is eternal. It's no wonder that mankind has made its first leap towards the stars. SECOND PART Night falls over Moscow. It's pleasant to stroll through the city at this hour, to listen to the quieting bustle of city streets and admire the sparkling dance of the fountains. Every day, the Olympics have named new champions. However, those who organized the games also consider themselves Olympians. For several years, the builders worked in keeping with the Olympic principle: Faster. Higher. More beautiful! They looked forward to seeing the athletes in the Olympic Village. Moscow has long been renowned for its hospitality. And we can surely say that the Olympiad is a welcome guest. The Muscovites have worked diligently to make the Olympic athletes feel at home. If the athletes and guests are happy, comfortable, and enjoy themselves, it will fill Moscow's kind, warm heart with pride and joy. About two million Olympic guests and fans were able, during the games, to view the Olympic festival of the arts. The country's eldest could not come to Moscow at this time, but they have sent their younger brothers, Abkhazia's Ensemble of Centenarians. The most robust among them is the tea planter Timur Vanacha. He is 114 years old. These dancers are the great-grandchildren of our centenarians, the State Folk Dance Ensemble of Georgia. Virsky Ukrainian National Folk Dance Ensemble came to the Olympiad from Kiev. In the circus, the living Olympic mascot, Misha the bear performs. He has surely practiced quite a lot and strictly observed his training regimen to earn the right to perform at such a grand athletic celebration. The arts and sports. Sports and the arts. They have so much in common. The Sports Palace is enthralled by a breathtaking gymnastic spectacle. Competing for the title of all-around champion are two elite gymnasts: Alexandr Dityatin... and Nikolai Andrianov. In competition, the most difficult acts are performed extremely skillfully. The virtuosic grace of Aleksandr Dityatin impresses the judges and the audience, and he becomes the number-one gymnast. In the women's competition, it was difficult to guess the winner. Many stars have gathered at the Luzhniki gymnastic platform. The viewers are captivated by a spectacular performance, where emotions, beauty, grace, courage create a remarkable and dramatic story. There is endless prognostication, Some predict Olympic champion Nadia Comaneci will win, while others believe it will be the young Natalia Shaposhnikova. In an intense competition, just a little more precision, emotion, spirit and grace is shown by Leningrad's Elena Davydova. From one discipline to the next, she increases her lead, and rightfully earns the title of all-around champion. Elena Davydova is the all-around champion of the Olympiad. STRONGER Every bit of his epic and overpowering strength was invested into the Olympic gold-medal throw by Yuri Sedykh. The javelin is thrown with ease and playful spirit by Cuban Olympic first-timer Maria Colon. We met them at the Olympic Village. Anatoli's on the right, Sergei on the left. Or is it the other way around? But it doesn't matter. What does matter is that the Beloglazov twins will compete in the freestyle wrestling finals. Anatoli is considered the oldest: He was born 15 minutes before Sergei. Sergei is winning with great style. Or is that not Sergei, but Anatoli? No, it's actually Sergei. Now, it's Anatoli's turn. Yes, we can say that the twins performed a four-hand Olympic concert triumphantly. For the first time in freestyle wrestling, two twins became Olympic champions, Anatoli and Sergei, Sergei and Anatoli. It actually doesn't matter. It was the Beloglazov twins. Now, this is Greco-Roman wrestling. One of the greatest athletes of antiquity was the wrestler Milo of Croton, who won six Olympiads in a row. The Greeks compared him to Hercules. For over 20 years, Milo was unequaled. He's said to have trained as a child by carrying a calf. As time passed, the calf grew, and Milo grew ever stronger. One day, he brought a four-year-old bull to the Olympic stadium. Six times he was crowned with the Olympic champion's wreath. But that was not the only fame of the Croton strongman. A student of Pythagoras, he authored a few scientific works. Olympic hero and scientist, Milo was not an exception. Pythagoras himself was an Olympic winner. Many of the greatest Hellenic names are associated with sports: Aristotle... Plato... the poets Aeschylus... Sophocles... Euripides... the philosopher Socrates... the historian Herodotus, the orator Demosthenes, and the father of medicine, Hippocrates. Belgian Robert Van de Walle has shown true character on the tatami. Fast thinking, rapid response and superb technique was shown by the French judokas. Angelo Parisi and Thierry Rey have taken the gold medals. When the crowded hall sees the two-time Olympic champion Te?filo Stevenson, it's easy to tell right away, this is the stride of a winner. The winner is Te?filo Stevenson, Cuba. Te?filo Stevenson has become Olympic champion for the third time! The first words of gratitude are to his teacher, Soviet trainer Chervonenko who was able to see in the lanky Cuban boy a future world-class star of boxing. Indeed, man has become stronger. May power be kind, and force, gentle. The women of the Olympiad. An equestrian from Vienna, Elisabeth Theurer. Her performance was preceded by quite a romantic story, the Austrian Equestrian Federation refused to sponsor her trip to Moscow. This, however, did not stop the graceful Amazon. Elisabeth Theurer flew to our capital on the plane of her friend, professional racer Niki Lauda who graciously delivered her and her horse, by night, to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Elisabeth Theurer on a dapple gray horse, Mon Ch?rie, wins the Olympic equestrian contest. In Ancient Greece, women were not allowed into the Olympic Games. The Greek oracles foresaw what it would lead to. If a woman attempted to get into the sacred games in Olympia, then, according to history, she was dealt with in this way. There was, however, a loving mother by the name Pherenike, who taught sparring to her son Pisodorus and trained him for the Olympic Games. Wearing men's clothing, she came to Olympia. By mixing with the crowd of paedotribes, as the trainers were called back then, she was able to enter the stadium to watch Pisodorus's sparring. When her son defeated all his rivals and became an Olympic champion, the overjoyed mother could not hold back, and rushed toward her son, but, running, she lost the men's clothing and gave herself away. By law, Pherenike had to be thrown from a crag. But the judges pardoned her, because this woman was the mother of a champion. This set a precedent for breaking the laws of the Olympics, allowing women to enter. The trick was taking the first step. The results in the women's events at Moscow are said to be only 50 years behind the men's. By all accounts, the men's records from the early Olympiads have long been broken by women. There was a time when women were called the "weaker sex." But in this competition, women have shown such character, such hunger for victory, such persistence, that men have nothing on them. Certain that not only flowers and fine outfits look good on them, they believe that the best adornments are Olympic medals made of noble metals. Oh, women, women, the kind miracle workers of the Olympiad. Without you, the Olympiad would not be so romantic, so exciting. How beautiful your tears of joy, and your sad smiles. And while you, dear women, fight quietly and fiercely for victory, just look how talkative the men can be. And Irina Nazarova leads in Lane 1. And where is Karoline K?fer? At this moment, in second place. This could be incredible. Karoline, with 50 meters to go. But right behind her Judit Forg?cs fights for it. But now, Irena Szewinska passes her by. It's a good start for Wells, he's on the outside. Leonard keeps him busy. Running even with Silvio Leonard. Leonard, Wells. Leonard, Wells. Panzo ends in eighth place. Silvio Leonard wins. Amazing. Making it look easy... In second place is Warren. Kirov. Kirov is the winner. Warren comes in second. Marajo drops back to third place. The scoreboard reads zero to zero here in Moscow's Dynamo Stadium. If your TV is not a Zenith, you have no idea of image and sound. If your TV is not a Zenith, you have no idea of image quality. The ball is taken by Number 11, Hamad. Now he passes back to the left. Ball goes to Number 5. Pass received. The referee says to place the ball... Herberth Gonzales to Vi?fara. Looks like Retat just said 30. Let's heat it up for the Kuwait team. Because Vi?fara has come out of the hole. Play changes over to Peluffo. He passes late. The ball opens up and is lost. Throw-in which favors the Kuwait team. The football tournament of the 1980 Olympics was marked by intense competition. The games were held in four cities: Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk and Moscow. In the final match, Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany meet. The fate of the game was decided with a goal by Czechoslovakia's Svoboda, 1:0. The Czechoslovakian team celebrates its Olympic victory. The Olympiad has reached the homestretch. Now is the time to give credit to the people who influence the competitions in the most crucial way while remaining unnoticed by the spectators. These people are the trainers. They are the ones who construct the victories, they are the authors of an unforgettable and stunning performance, the directors of a breathtaking athletic spectacle. Our deepest gratitude goes out to them. Lord Killanin presents the symbolic key to the new president of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch. Mr. Samaranch says... We can say with certainty that the Moscow Olympic Games were a success, not only in terms of organization, but also in the level of athletics achieved. One can argue that these were outstanding Olympic Games, the 36 world records set here attest to that. We are very pleased with the achievements made in Moscow. A realm of competition dreams and passion The kind world of sports matches The songs at the start are understood universally And the seconds do not lie We will remember these moments We will cherish in our hearts The beauty and the inspiration And the desire to make friendships 6,000 athletes from 81 countries, representatives from all five continents of our planet have competed in the name of peace and friendship, for the sake of the beauty of sports. For many, Moscow became the luckiest city. At the 1980 Olympics, 74 Olympic records, 36 world records, 39 European records, and hundreds of national records were set. The 1980 Olympics have proved to be the victory of the Olympic movement, of the Olympic ideal. At the microphone, the president of the International Olympic Committee, Lord Michael Killanin. The sportsmen gathered here for the games of the 22nd Olympiad have shown their great friendship in fair competition despite their varying colors, religious or political philosophies. The mastery and records of many participants are ample proof of the grand success of these games. I only grieve that some athletes were not able to participate. In the name of the International Olympic Committee, I offer the most sincere best wishes to the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Brezhnev and to the people of the Soviet Union. I declare the games of the 22nd Olympiad, closed. These Olympic days have flown by like a brief moment. And now is the time to say farewell to the Olympiad. The stadium grows quiet The time of miracles fades away Farewell, our dear Misha Return to your fairy-tale forest Let's wish each other much success And kindness and love without end The clear echo of the Olympics Will remain in our poems and in our hearts Farewell, Moscow, farewell Farewell, Olympic fairy tale Wish for our dreams to be fulfilled Wish for dear friends to meet again Dear friends are parting But tenderness will remain in our hearts We shall cherish this song Farewell, we will meet again We shall cherish this song Farewell, we will meet again THE END
