I ran up the subway steps As I crossed the street at the traffic light, I found you Not even once have you ever known serenity here on this planet Within your reach all you've ever had is loneliness Take care, boy Walk into the light To get there it might be a long journey When the clouds hide the sun the city quiets down They say it's at that very moment when it falls from the sky On top of the trees lining the road love quivers On the edge of the path the spirits dance Take care, boy Go into the light To get there it might be a long journey They say the distant sea is tired In the mountains, they say that the stag's bell echoes... If you make a candid prayer, it will most certainly come true the rest of us have already left our dreams behind us Take care, boy Go into the light To get there it might be a long journey Take care, boy Walk into the light To get there it might be a long journey...

That makes 3,911 yen. I'll give you change from 5,000 yen. Here's 1,000 yen. And 89 yen. Please count it. Can I hand you the magazine? Thank you for your patience. Thank you very much. Hey... Can I have a receipt for my purchase? In what name? "Porter". Shall I put "Miscellaneous"? Thank you for your patience. Here's your receipt. Thank you. Welcome. What's up? You started again? You know stealing is a crime. You can get expelled from high school. I'm dead broke. I have no water, electricity or gas. What? There's some for you too. Since it's this... I forgive you. What is it? You're fired. I'm not obliged to pay you anything. But I'm paying you up till today. You know very well why I'm firing you. I won't do it again. You won't? Those who say that start again the next day. Really! I swear I won't do it again! If you fire me, I won't be able to survive! Don't bother... The person replacing you starts tomorrow. When did you decide this? Doesn't matter. His hourly pay is a lot less than yours. I've made up my mind. Take this and go! I'll never get by. I'll never get by! Kawai! Did you rat one me? Kawai! It's me, open up! You forgot this. I didn't rat on you. I swear. I'm exhausted. I've had many shots for the pain, but they don't work. I'm in so much pain that I can't sleep. I'm tired. Ryo... someone from accounting came by earlier. Last month's costs still haven't been paid. I'll pay later. Of course... I should never have married someone like your father. He has no heart and no tears. Even your school tuition... I've asked for it incessantly. He won't send me a mere penny. The poverty in which we live, the illness that has ruined my health, it's all his fault. I'll leave now. There's no bigger bastard than him... No matter how many time I've asked, he doesn't even call... HELP WANTED Welcome. Actually... I'm home. You live here? Who is he? A student from school, Kawai. The cakes at the soccer game... I don't remember! What? The cakes? I'm so hungry... I'm going to die. Listen, Mr. Kawai. Your mother slipped into a coma last night. You're her only family. She needs a home-nurse. What should we do? There's no hope? She has two or three days. Mr. Kawai! Telegram! Telegram! What I have to say makes me uncomfortable, but it's my job. Your mother's hospital bills haven't been paid in two months. I think you are aware of this. Normally after 10 days of non-payment the patient is kicked out. But your mother's condition didn't allow that. But, now... your mother has passed away. The payment will have to be taken care of rapidly. This is all I have. But if I give it all to you, I... This is really all you have? My mother hasn't worked in six months. We don't have any savings. The single-parent benefits were swallowed by expenses. We asked for minimal-income benefits but they still haven't been allotted. I had a small job, but I was fired. I have no income. This is all I have. It would be good if you could give me some... In any case, you'll still have to pay all of it. You're her only close relative? Ok. This is not easy... Do you have any other family? What a mess! When someone dies, a funeral is organized. That's why I'm here. For those with small incomes, we have funeral options to meet their needs. For example... something like this... This is our least expensive funeral package. Your mother must have life insurance. Do you have her certificate? How will you come up with the money? In any case, your mother can only stay here tonight. Tomorrow morning, she'll be transported to the funeral home. By then, you'll have to come up with 200,000 yen. Are you listening to me? What are you doing here? Money. My mother is dead. I need money. Your mother is dead? Yes... I promise to pay you back. Lend me some money! How much do you want? 400,000 yen for the hospital. 200,000 for the funeral. That makes 600,000. Where am I supposed to find that? I have no choice. I'll have to steal. Don't be nuts. In any case, there's not that much in the register. I'm not talking about that. Sorry, I'm late. Let's go. - What? We're not stealing? - Follow me. Where in the world are we going? Follow me. Hey... This is creepy. You're not. Carry her legs. Are you crazy or what? Sorry for not paying the rent. Is that you, honey? So, did you find some work? Oh, I see. Actually, that's not why I'm calling. There's a strange kid in front of the house. He scares me. Do you mind coming home early? Who are you? Tell me or I'll call the police. What high school do you go to? Show me your school ID. Calm down. Did you sleep well? I contacted your high school to get more information on you. I also contacted the police over there. It seems your mother has died. You have a friend named Kizawa. Apparently you asked him to steal your mother's body. Stealing a body is a crime, you know. You didn't know that? Not paying the hospital or for the funeral is also a crime. Of course! So... what was I supposed to do? No matter what, it was a crime. It seems you play soccer. And you dream of playing professionally. You wanted to become a pro to take care of your mother. That's wonderful. What a great dream! How about getting back on track and making your dream come true? How does that sound? Without money, how could I become a pro? Without money, how could I pay the school tuition? How could I pay for soccer club? For food, I manage by stealing. But without a home, how will I survive a Tohoku winter? Before even graduating, I'd have frozen to death. First of all, as a minor, you're eligible for State aid. Then... why didn't my mother get help? You adults... All you do is talk about money! People's feelings don't interest you. By the way, where did you bring your mother's body? Silence is not an answer. I buried her... in the sea. Where will you take me? Tonight you'll be turned over to your police. This is serious, you know. Two investigators came to Tokyo to bring you back to your far-off town. And then what will happen to me? First we have to localize your mother's body. Then you'll be booked and then there'll be a family court hearing. Then you'll be placed. In a juvenile delinquent center? Yes, in a way. For a kid like you, it's the best place to get physical and emotional rest. You have a wonderful dream. In order for it to come true, you need a strong and healthy spirit. I have to make a call. I have a daughter your age. It's her birthday today. I have to tell them I'll be late. Rest a little. In memory of my father, and Antoine Doinel. Special thx to Ikeda69 Custom subtitled by stahl
