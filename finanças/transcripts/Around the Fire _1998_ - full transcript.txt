[AUDIO LOGO] [MUSIC - DIRE STRAITS, "WATER OF LOVE"] High and dry in the long hot day. Lost and lonely in every way. Got the flats all around me, sky up above. Yes, I need a little water. I've been long lonely and my heart feels pain. crying out for some soothing rain. I believe I have taken enough. Yes, I need a little water love. Water of love deep in the ground, but there ain't no water here to be found. Someday, baby, when the river runs free it's going to carry that water of love to me. I'll be your personal counselor while you're here. My name is-- I'm not going to be here for very long. Be clear on one thing, Simon, if you do not stay and complete the full 28 days, I will call the police and you will go to jail. Do you understand? Hm. You and I will meet periodically here in this room. The rest of your time you'll spend in group therapy, meetings, step workshops, meditation, bed, and meals. Do you have any questions? No. I have your police report here. I know why they think you're here. What do you think? I got busted. Yeah, with the remnants of a vial of LSD. Do you plan on getting anything out of this other than avoiding jail? Yeah, I do. I'm thinking about gaining a couple of pounds, toning up a bit. You think this is a fucking joke? You are in rehab. You did not get here because you're on some kind of a winning streak. You got here because you couldn't make it out there. Your way didn't work. Your jokes didn't work. You lost. You think that's fucking funny? It's just I think my jokes were fine. If you're scared, then be scared. If you are angry, then be angry. That's honest. But I'm not going to sit here and watch you tell stupid jokes to hide the fact that you are scared and you are angry. That is some bullshit. Do you get it? Whatever. No, not whatever. Do you-- I fucking get it, all right? I get it. My name is Kate, Kate Matthews. [SPEAKING HEBREW] Thank you. Hey, I got an idea. Make an H. Matt? We'll finish it later, OK? Matt, I am so sorry. She was such a wonderful woman. Thank you, Lauren. Yes, she was. Simon! Simon! What happened? Is this your son? Step son. Simon, you all right? Yeah. Matt! No, no, this deal's already set. Don't let them worm out of this. Hey, I'll call you back. What's going on here? Your son was caught shoplifting at Patrick &amp; Company. What? Simon? It was an accident. I didn't realize that I was doing-- All right. Well, there must be some kind of mistake here. No mistake. Well, what's he alleged to have stolen? This. A pen? That's not what happened. What happened was I was in there and the salesperson automatically thought that I was-- Well, OK, officer, where do we go from here? You sign right there, and I'll release him to your custody. OK. I guess you can use this. There you go. Thank you very much, officer. Yeah. OK, officer, thank you for your trouble. Mm-hmm. Sorry about this. Good night, folks. Yeah, you have a good night too. Yeah. Thanks again. Dad, I'm sorry. I put the pen in my pocket. I didn't know that-- I wasn't trying to-- OK. All right. Go upstairs, get dressed. Come on. Simon, we'll talk about this later. Jesus Christ! Where? Matt. Oh, come on. Don't get so excited. I'm sure it was an accident. It couldn't have been intentional. I'm sorry! No! Get out! No. Get out! I love you. It's too late. What about Simon? I'll take care of Simon. No! Get out! And come on, school is going to help. They'll be able to stay on top of him a lot better than we will here. And I'll talk to him. I promise, I'll talk to him in the car. And you-- you look great. Another great soiree, Matthew. Great to be here. Look at this gorgeous creature. Ah. Hi, Lauren. Charming as always, Bill. How's Jen? She's in Bermuda with her mother. You recognize him? Holy c-- Simon! Hey, come over here. Hey, Mr. McCollum. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm OK. I understand you're off to boarding school tomorrow, huh? And then on to Princeton? If I can get into Princeton. He's going to get in. He's going to get in. Yeah, you bet he will. Don't forget, football is on its way. Yes. Arrr! Arrr! Hey, how about that merger, huh, Bill? Don't worry about the merger. It's fine. I'm not worried about it. In fact, I'm thinking about putting more in. And I think you should too because we're going to have a great fourth quarter. All right. All right, Matthew, I'm in. That went well. Yeah. To us. Hey, you going to take a shower? Because if you're going to shower, hurry up. You've got to do it now because we've got a lot of work to do. What time is it? I'll take that as a no. Can you wake me up when breakfast comes. You want the hopper or the sink and shower? OK, man. I'll do it later. Listen, here's how it's done around here, all right? If you don't get up and do your job, we both don't eat breakfast. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Nope. And I ain't going to miss breakfast. Fucking psycho. Every day, Joe? Yep. You should go over to him, Matt. Yeah. I know. Now, that's a power tie. Guaranteed success in business if you wear it. I guess I'll wear it. There's a little something extra in there too. Thanks, dad. Thank you. Well, we've got a long drive back. We should be going, OK? Matt? Yeah? Is there something we should be talking about? Oh, there's probably a thousand things to talk about right now, but what's important is that we get on the road because we've got to get rested for work tomorrow and that Simon gets up those steps so he can get ready for his work. Just-- you just buckle down and stay focused. This isn't going to do me any good. I don't know anybody here. Enough already, OK? All right? All right. Thank you. Arrr. Arrr. All right. I want you to check in with us as often as possible. We're only two hours away. Lauren, got to go. Call us. You feel any better? [MUSIC PLAYING] You were gone for so long. Away. Gone away. [INAUDIBLE SINGING] What are you going to do about that, you little pussy? Yeah, that's what I thought. You quite like getting pissed on, don't you? Hey, why don't you cut it out, Patterson? You got a problem, Andrew? What's your problem, Andrew? That's enough, all right? No, I don't think so. Oh, go ahead, Patterson. You're a big man. Why don't you knock me out? Go ahead. Hey, I'm Andrew. That guy is a fucking asshole. Dentist day, and the whole school knew exactly what happened. Who cares? I should have fought back or punched him or something, right? Yeah, and Patterson would have destroyed you, right? Look at you, though. You should change your tissue. Hey, thanks a lot, man. It's a cool. I'm Simon. Hey, what kind of music do you like? What does that have to do with anything? Let's just say it's probably the single most important question I could ask you. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is the story about the knight and the dragon. Kyle, have we been through this? Teachers knock. You don't knock. You get it? There's a phone call for Simon. Dude, I cannot afford to get caught again. How did you know he was in here anyway? Duh, watched you two walk in here a few minutes ago. Duh, I'll kick your fucking ass if you ever come in here again. You got it? Hi, Simon. Hey, how's it going? Yeah, it's me. It's me. Yeah, is everything OK? How's football, Simon? It's fine. It's going good. Well, how's school? Hard work. Shh, shh. Yeah, well, you're staying on top of it, right? Yeah, it's on top of it. I'm on-- yeah, I'm on top of it. Right. Hello? Oh, Simon, I got some great posters for your room. We'll send them off tomorrow. Oh, good. Why don't you-- why do you send all my video games and and my stereo and my bed too, please? Your bed? What's wrong with your bed? Nothing. I'm just fucking-- I'm just-- I was just kidding around. Hello? Good. Good. Good. I told you he'd be fine, right? Oh, hey, Lauren had one of her lawyers from her firm take care of that ticket for you. So that's finally behind us. Simon, are you there? Yeah, it's great. Are you sure you're OK, Simon? Yeah, I'm fine. Why don't I call you guys after the weekend? OK. Hey, want to go to a concert this weekend? Check it out. Wow. Hey, hey. He's a hottie. Look at that little lost puppy. I'm going to get him some stir fry. Please don't you dare. Hey! Hey, you. Yo, bro. Yeah, you, you. Come here a second. What's up? Try this. I'm Jennifer, and this is Trace. How are you doing? Simon. Never mind me. I'm just dying over here. And this is our demented friend, Kevin. How are you doing, Kevin? I'm Simon. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. Hot veggie stir fry. It's the super kind! Only 2 bucks. So where do you go to school? I go to boarding school, Cheatham. Oh, one of the chosen few. Honey, we are all part of the chosen few. Hm. I wish they would have chosen someone else, you know. Yo, bro, who'd you say you come here with? I came here with this guy named Andrew, but I lost him. This whole crowd-- Andrew? New York Andrew? Yeah, I think he's from there. Oh! Yin yang Andrew? You guys know him? Oh, it's synchronicity shit again. Hey, how much for the stir fry? You got a ticket? No, but I can make a trade. What you got? I got some stickers. Cool. OK. How about four of these for a plate? Right on. Have a great show, man. Thank you. Here, Kev. Cool. Somebody give me a hand here. Oh, let me help you. How's that? It works. Yeah? Thanks. So what do you guys do? I mean, do you guys camp out here or what happens? How many shows have you been to? Actually, this is my first show. Ah. Ah. Now, that's an enviable position to be in. I'm going to take a spin around the lot and try to get some tickets. Want to come, Simon? Actually, you know what? I really need to stay around and look for Andrew. All right, suit yourself. Well, if you're going for a minute. Here, take a hit of this. We'll be back in a minute. It was nice meeting you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, come Lizards World. Any two stickers for 5 bucks. We got lots of cool shirts-- Wow, this place is great. What's up? Hey, Trace, my man. What's going on, babe? How are you doing? Hi. Wow. I'm going to take this-- this t-shirt. There you go. It's-- Trace? Uh. Wow. This is big fucking joint, man. Here. Here. I can't handle that anymore. Double bionic hydroponic ganja goofballs. Hey, you want to buy a ganja goofball, man? I don't want to be rude, but those look like somebody already ate them. What are you talking about, man? Wait, hold up. Let me get two of those, bro. Right on. I don't know, man. Thanks, bro. Peace. Peace. Cheers. The goofball man must be killed. Yo, bro. You should hang with us for a few months. It's not possible, man. It is possible. Anything is possible. Hey, Simon. Hey, man. I lost you back there. Where'd you go? New York Andrew. I like that tie dye. Trace. You like this? What's up? How are you? Good. Good to see you, man. I want you to meet somebody. Jason, this is Simon. Simon, how are you? How are you doing? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. And you know Trace. Hey, Trace, what's kicking? Hey, you, baby. Just you, baby. Oh. Oh, Jason, I got a question for you. Should Simon go on tour for the rest of his life? Well, what stands in the way? Boarding school. Ooh, I see. Definitely tour, bro. Yeah, but how do you know? Because I graduated from Andover last year and I still managed to see 30 shows a year four years running. Look at this guy. Would this man lie to you? No, definitely not. Definitely not. Thanks, Jason. Simon, I'll see you around. All right. Take it easy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mm-hmm. Bathroom looks pretty good. Surprised you, didn't we? Simon, there is no smoking in this room. I don't smoke. Allow me to finish, please. In case you haven't heard already from Joe, this is his third time here. Joe, tell Simon why we had to ask you to leave twice before. I was smoking in the room. That's right. Now tell him why you came back. I'm an alcoholic. That means I have an obsession of the mind coupled with an allergy of the body. And I'm here to get better and learn how to stop drinking one day at a time. Mm-hmm. Our best student, memorizes the book. Welcome back, Joe, for the third time. You can go to breakfast. Joe, if either you are caught smoking in this room, you'll both be thrown out. Am I perfectly clear? Yes, Ms Matthews. What did I do? What did you do? I didn't do anything. Why can't I go for breakfast? What? I did it. It's done. Simon, there's a universal law. And it is my job to get it through to you before you kill yourself. So listen up. Your happiness and sanity are directly proportional to the amount of self honesty you can develop. If you don't know how to make up a bed because nobody ever showed you, that's fine. I'll show you now. And then after this, you'll do it on your own. Oh, one more thing, I want you to help Joe. Oh, you got to be kidding me. Being in a similar predicament, you're bound to be of service to this guy. Similar predicament? Me and that guy have nothing in common. You believe that? I totally believe that. Well, you both made it to rehab. [CHUCKLES] You want one? No, I'm trying to study, man. Simon, that should never stop you. Come on. No, I'm studying. Simon, do you know about state-dependent thinking? What's that? It's like this psychological concept where if you're all baked when you're studying something, in order to remember it, you have to totally be baked again. So I'm thinking, as long as I'm good and baked when I take this test, I'm going to totally kick ass. Afternoon, gentlemen. Mr. Whitney. Hello, Mr. Whitney. Another weekend off campus. That's how many in a row now? Something like four. No, it's like three or two. Not too many. It might behoove the two of you to stick around and concentrate on midterms, don't you think? Oh, we brought our books. Really? It's time to go now, Simon. Yeah. You make sure to have yourself a stellar weekend, Mr. Whitney. You know, I never lost anyone close to me. You come here a lot? Yeah. She's the only person I can trust. Well, that's not true, bro. Thanks for bringing me, Andrew. Hey. Always check the hippie pouch. Wow. What's this going to do? Well, you're definitely going to want to cancel your afternoon appointments if that's what you mean. Hey, take a look at the freak. No way! Come on, man. [MUSIC PLAYING] 1, 2, 3, oh! Wake up and live, y'all. Wake up and live. Wake up and live, y'all. Wake up and live. Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you're riding through the ruts, don't you complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy. Don't bury your thoughts. Put your vision to reality. All together now. Wake up and live, y'all. Wake up and live. Yeah. Wake up and live, y'all. Wake up and wake up and live. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't mind failing in this world. Don't mind failing in this world. Stay down here with the raggedy crew because getting up there means stepping on you. So I don't mind failing in this world. I don't mind faith in this world. I don't mind failing in this world. Somebody else's definition isn't going to measure my soul's condition. I don't mind failing in this world. I don't mind failing in this world. I don't mind failing this world. I'll stay down here with the raggae crew because getting up there means stepping on you. I don't mind failing in this world. Yee! [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm getting kind of tired. Well, whining ain't going to help any. Excuse me. All right. All right. Why don't we check out Tucson Mike's bus. Oh, yeah. Wait, wait, I want to hang with Simon. I'll hang with you, man. Where are you guys going to be? I think-- Oh, right over at that bus. I think I'm just going to go on my lab. I'll be hanging out in the van. Why don't you come and find me. All right. I'll come see you. Don't keep him all night. No worries. See you later, K? Yeah. Where are we going? That way. All right. I'ma come up. Yeah. So I'm in a skirt with full dreads, my mom's shaking her head, and my dad chimes in, "It's just a phase, Marianne. he'll grow out of it." That's when I knew that they'd never, never get it. What about your parents? Oh. Well, my-- my dad doesn't understand this whole thing at all. How about your mom? She died when I was really young. I'm sorry. I ought to be sorry. Wow, these are amazing. Thank you. Oh, here, here. No, no. this-- No, no, no. -- part I do myself. OK. So what do you think of the music? God, I can't even explain it. You just did. What happened, man? You ever hear anybody say that there ought to be a law against having too much fun? Yeah. I had way too much fun. What's your family? I mean, don't you want to be with them? Don't you-- I am-- Yes, you are. I'm going to crash. All right. Where are you headed? I was thinking about going over to Texas Fred's bus. Stop. You mean Tucson Mike's bus? Oh, Simon. Oh. Watch your step. My step here or some heavy shit like my step in life? Both. Yeah. Have a good sleep, man. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Hi. I just saw Trace. Yeah? He was kissing another guy. Probably Ritchie. Right. It's probably Ritchie. Don't worry. Well, it's a nice place you have here. Thanks. So how are you? Good. [MUSIC PLAYING] Should I get naked now? Is that a trick question? Fuck. Help. It doesn't work that way. Are you OK? Got our test back today. Where were you? Well, math sucks, man. Check it out. 96? Dude, this is definitely a cause for celebration. In honor of your 96? You want one? Now I want you to think before you answer this question. Are you a doper? I'm a doper? Doper. Mr. Whitney, what is the usual procedure when this kind of thing happens? Essentially, we're looking at a one week suspension of all school privileges. Now as long as Simon toes the line and his grades remain high, I see no reason why Princeton or any other college needs to hear about this incident. Thanks, Dan. What's going to happen to Andrew? He was caught once before. He's being expelled. Well, it sucks. That's enough. And you should know that I've asked the school to put you on restriction for the entire spring semester. So you better plan on spending your weekends here at school from now on. Oh, come on. You got to be kidding me. Simon, you can't afford to be distracted right now. Why do you guys get off my back? Don't you dare speak to us that way. I will not allow you to ruin this chance. Now you will bear down and pull it together right now. Am I perfectly clear? Yes, sir. Dear, Simon. I don't know what it is you need. But I do hope you find it. You always have this picture of your mom, so I want to send it to you. I hope the other one brings you a smile. We miss you. Love always, Jennifer. Simon? Simon, wake up. Hey. What are you guys doing here? Why haven't you called? I'm staying for exams and stuff. You know what it is. Too busy for your friends, huh? Oh. That's no excuse, Simon. Yeah. Where's Kevin? Kevin's dead. Somewhere I have never traveled, gladly beyond inexperience, your eyes have their silence. In your most frail gesture are things which enclose me. Though I've closed myself, you open always petal by petal, nature's first flower. I forgot the rest. But the last night is, nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands. Goodbye, babe. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Well, I'm a felon in this world. Oh, I'm a felon in this world. Someone elses definition, Even with my souls permission. You must shit your pants when you saw those lights behind you. I don't even remember getting in the truck. That's hardcore, man. Shit, that ain't nothing. Fucked up thing is I keep getting caught. I hear you. This time it's going to be different, though. Man, I could use a drink. I fucked up once. I guess I'm just supposed to forget about all the good times, right? No. I mean, I'm not telling you to forget about the good times. I'm trying to get you to see that the good times are getting scarce. And first, there's fun. Then there's fun with problems. And then there's just problems. That's the way it works. But you know what the thing is? The thing is I got friends that do drugs and deal drugs, and they have no problems. So you know? I don't give a shit about that. I want you to find out what works for you, Simon, and I'll tell you something, and then, you're all on your own. I mean, this place can help you. Your friends can't help you. Your parents can't help you. Until you find out how to be honest with yourself, you are just shit out of luck. Mommy? You're an idiot. Simon, don't call me an idiot, all right? Look, if you want to get kicked out of here, that's your choice. Just don't get me involved. Put that shit out. Just one fucking cigarette. What's the big deal? Put that goddamn cigarette out, Joe. Michael Dayton. Simon Harris. Gordon McIver. Dean Zingers. Ladies and gentlemen, I gave you the graduating class of 1996. Have a great summer. Yeah! I am so proud of you. You guys came. Wow. What's up, Simon? High five. High fives. Look at you. Look at you, baby. Oh, no! Simon. Dad. Congratulations. Thank you, dad. Thank you. Terrific. It's all here. Oh, these are my-- these are my friends. Alfie, Jason, Jennifer, and this is-- Trace. This is Trace. Hi, it's good to meet you. Good to meet you too. Good to meet you. Nice to meet you. Please don't do that. Well, you all were quite a cheering section. Thanks for coming, really. Oh, Simon. We have a gift for you, and this is from all of us. Oh, you guys shouldn't have. Wow, look at this. Look at this. Wow. That's awesome. That's so cool. So, Mr. Harris, what did you get your kid? Well, it's kind of a surprise. Good, I love surprises. Apparently. Well, OK. Simon, you stuck it out, and before you go off to Princeton, Lauren and I want to take you on a trip to Europe. All this summer. London, Paris, Rome. You're staying in the most amazing hotels you're not going to believe them. Good. Sounds like so much fun. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] What? Simon. Come out here, please. Lauren and I want to speak to you for a moment. I'm sleeping. Simon, come out down here now. We'll talk to you about this package, please. What package? You got a package here from an August West from Billy Dylan Productions in San Francisco. Matt and I'd like you to open it in front of us. Here, I'll take it. I'll open it later. Simon, we don't come into your room because it's your space, and we trust you. But if you can't even open a package in front of us, how can we continue to trust you? I can't believe you just said that. You do know that sending drugs through the mail is a felony. You just automatically assume it's drugs, right? It's my package, dad. It's my fucking package. I know that. Shit. What time is it? It's time to open the package. I got to go to the airport. The airport? You're going to get your passport today. I'm not getting my passport. What? Look. You know what, I don't know how to tell you this, OK, but here's the story. I'm not going to Europe with you, guys. OK? I'm really sorry. I should have said something sooner, but I got to catch a plane in 90 minutes. OK? Lauren? No, no, it's not OK. Where's my package, Lauren? Where are you going? I'm going out with my friends. Don't tell me you're going to spend the rest of your life with those people. I'm not talking about the rest of my life. Those people are going absolutely nowhere. Know what, I'm closer with those people than I'll ever be with you. Oh, Simon, you don't mean that. I'm going to San Francisco today. OK? Maybe for the summer, maybe for longer, I don't know. But I'm going. Well, you better think about that before you walk out the door because that's a serious decision. All right? We'll just open this package now, and then we'll all know. Allow me to open. I hope-- Stop it, both of you. Simon! Dammit! [MUSIC PLAYING] Just open it up. Open it. OK. Open it. OK. OK. "To whom it may concern, I bet you thought this was drugs. Love, Trace." What is this? It's a combination anthology alarm clock. Fuck. Guaranteed delivery by 10:30. Dude, it was just a wake up call. And a gift. It's a fucking gift, man. What's wrong? What are you, bummed, huh? No, no, no. It's just my parents. They thought it was drugs. I mean, they wanted to open it. Oh, man. I said I let them open it. Then we can start sending real drugs to your house. Will you shut up? You're sick. Shut up. It's cool, though, guys. Thank you. Shut up. And stick out your tongue. There you go. No. I'm out here. See you, guys. We'll see you after the show. What's up with her? Yo, Trace. Yo. Yo, what's up? Man, I hear you got sheets. Are you looking for pages? No, just singles. Look, if you want to get high, I'll get you high for the show, but I'm looking to get rid of pages. Look, maybe you could give me a sheet to pass around, see how people like it, you know? Look, bro, do you have bank? Because if you don't have bank, I don't even want to be having this conversation. Yeah. All right, look, take these, and meet me at the tunnel right after the show if you like, right? Bring sheets. Not a problem. Asshole. How come you make this deal? What? I'll come with you. No, no. I-- Come on. I think you should come another time. I don't know how large it's going to be. When? Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. Just chill, all right? You get your chance. All right. All right. Wait up. [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you OK? [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, wait, wait, I got to go pee, all right? Hold on. Oh, hold my backpack, man. Yeah. Hold it. Keep a tight grip, all right? I'm serious. I remember what's in there, all right? Hi. I've got to go and set up the stir fry. So you better come and buy me, OK? Oh, fuck. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. Oh, cool. All right, so I'll meet you over the van, OK? All right. Peace. I just fucked with Trace big time. Oh yeah? Hi, baby. How are you? I'm OK. Yeah? Yeah. What's up? Smoking sure, huh? Yeah. You all right? Oh, yeah. Great acid, man. Thanks. So did you bring the sheets? Are you sure you're all right? Oh, totally. So you got the sheets? Can you help me? Stay. Stay. You're fucking high, Simon. I'm high, yeah. I'm high. Hey. What are you doing? Trace needs our help. Just relax. Just relax. I'll be OK. just watch. Trace is busted. That's not my backpack. "To whom it may concern, I bet she thought this was drugs. Love, Trace." What is this? This was tangled up. A trip. I don't believe this. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything, man. Strictly coincidental. I don't know. It was more than coincidental. I was going down big time, bro. Shit. I should be in jail right now. Whatever you need, bro. Anything, right? Well, there is one thing. You could hook me up with your chemist. Are you sure you're ready for that? Yep. Yeah. Totally ready for that. It can get a little weird over there. How weird could it possibly get? Jodie, Mary, can you hear me? They've been dipping all night. Even with the extra protection, you can't help but get high. Doc offered them some Thorazine, but they said they'd just rather ride it out. Riding out, they are. Sorry, man. Where's doc? Doc is involved as we speak. Hey, what's up, doc? What? This is my friend, Simon. Jesus Christ. What? Neil. Neil, how many times have we talked about this neurotic whispering shit? Well-- Whenever you whisper, you make everything very tense. And there's enough tension as it is. OK? OK. You're done? This is my friend, Simon Harris. The one I was telling you about. Oh, yes. Are you ready to go see how you do? [MUSIC PLAYING] Do you know what that is? Scott Joplin, Maple Leaf Rag. Very good. Trace, how do you like your Bloody Marys? To tell you the truth, doc, I'm kind of scared of the goddamn things. Well, let me give it a try. It's a good batch. Now I'm going to play a particular verse of Brown-eyed Women. I want you to hear this. [SINGING] 1920 when he stepped to the bar, drank to the tregs of the whiskey jar. 1930 when the wall caved in, he made his way selling red-eyed gin. Yeah. Who wrote that? Robert Hunter wrote the words, and Jerry put it to music. That's exactly right. But I don't know if you're making the connections, young man. Now what are they talking about in this tune? They're basically talking about partying in the roaring 20s and the Great Depression of the 30s. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes! It's about America's past, but it's also about our mythological past. It's also about our present. About the intoxication of high times and the depression that accompanies the comedown. It's like a universal thing, really. Oh, you're a bright boy. But do you see the real genius of this? Scott Joplin played Maple Leaf Rag at the turn of the century. Robert Hunter wrote Brown-eyed Women in the early '70s. They were talking about universal themes that have no temporal limitations. And they're hiding them right there for us to find. Right there in our own mythology. Right there for anyone to see. Now everybody can see. Because they haven't taken my LSD. 1943, the physicist was playing tennis and came up with a recipe for nuclear fission, the first atomic bomb. Thousands of miles away in Switzerland, Dr. Albert Hofmann was tripping his face off because he accidentally ingested a tiny amount of his new discovery, LSD 25. LSD will do to you whatever LSD wants to. [MUSIC PLAYING] Pay attention. Very well. I want you to put your hands face down on your knees, be quiet, and listen. Don't make any gestures or respond to anything at all. Simon, tell Joe what you think of him. What did you say to her? I didn't tell her anything. Just shut up, and put your hands on your knees. Go ahead. You think he's going to make it out there? Kate, I don't want to do this. Simon, I want you to look at Joe and find the courage to tell him what you see because I don't know if he's got the ability to see that for himself. Joe, you believe if everybody thinks things are OK, everything's going to be cool? It's like you told me. You're only in here 'cause you got caught, and if you didn't get caught, there wouldn't be a problem. You know, you're supposed to be in here for your wife and for your kids and for your family and so forth, but, you know, what about you? Aren't you tired of living for other people? I am. You're not going to get any fucking relief until you learn to deal with your own shit. Plain and simple. Are you OK? What? Are you OK? Yeah. Simon. I'm worried about you. Me too. I'm serious. Jennifer, why are you freaking out for? Because you always ignore me now. You never have time for me anymore. You've, like, completely changed. Yeah? Can you shut that? I'm freezing. It's fog. We'll be in New York soon. I know. I'd like to see where you grew up. My dad's house? I want to see your parents again. No. No. Maybe I'll call. K, you're good. Right on. Come back if you want more, all right? Ready to go into the show? No, baby, I got to meet some people. Oh, come on, I want you to come in with me. They're going to be on soon. You know what, take this, go in, and I'll meet you in there. Jennifer. Jennifer. Simon? Wow, long time no see. How you've been, man? It's like your little business venture is doing pretty well. Is that supposed to mean-- Why are you here, Simon? Man, I'm just here for the same reason that you are. The same reason as everybody. You're fucking up, dude. Look at you. Look at yourself. I'm fucking up? [MUSIC PLAYING] It's really great being back on the East Coast. So will you get a chance to see your parents while you're here? Actually I'm thinking we're going to head up there in a couple of days and spend some time with them. What do they think about what you're doing? Well-- I don't think you need the response you're looking for. Her parents actually support what she's doing. Well, I didn't say they didn't. Just ask her a question. Sure she can answer it by herself. Well, I can't exactly say they understand me, but they do know that I am with good people and that I'm happy. Do you have a job? I mean, how do you support yourself? I run a kitchen of sorts on tour. And you make enough doing that? Absolutely. I think we've done pretty well for ourselves. Simon, what-- what is this? It's the money we made from Jennifer's stir fry and my selling T-shirts. Worked hard, dad. Worked real hard. Well, good job, then. Good job. Yeah. So how long are you two going to be in New York? I read in The Times this morning that the concerts are going to be here through Thursday. We'd love it if you'd stay with us for the weekend. Yeah, we have some time this weekend. We've got plenty of room. I don't think so. Well, maybe we could work something out. That'd be great. I spell it out for you, guys. I don't want to stay here this weekend. We're not going to stay here this weekend, really. Simon, I think your father would be-- I'm not even talking to you. And don't do that, please. Sylvia, would you wait, please? Simon, I didn't mean to-- You know what, I'm tired of this bullshit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, let's not-- You know what, let's not pretend that things are OK 'cause the last time I was here, you guys fucking kicked me out. I didn't throw you out. You walked out the door on your own. I didn't push you out. Matt, don't get pulled into this. You know what your problem is? You know he'll never love you like he love my mom. That's all right, Lauren. That's all right. That's enough. Why don't we clear these plates off and be ready for dessert? Sylvia. She can help you. She can do it. God damn it, Simon! What is your problem? I think maybe we should go. Now we're going to go. We're going to go. Thank you for dinner. It's wonderful. Come on, Jennifer. I'm sorry. Please call if you need anything, Jennifer. It's nice to see you again, Jennifer. For any reason. Will you slow down? So what did you think of my family? Simon, your dad was trying. You saw the way he looked at me. He didn't believe me for one second. Not one second did he believe me. You're lying. It's not the point. The point is if I wasn't lying, he still wouldn't believe me. But you were lying. What was that shit at the dinner table, huh? I'm sorry, Mr. Harris? Jennifer, what are you sorry for? What is your problem? I think you just keep your suggestions to yourself, you know, 'cause I don't need them. My family doesn't want to hear me now. That's perfect trip tonight based on your all-time great idea, Simon. I don't even know who you are anymore. If you're not doing drugs, you're selling drugs, and when you're not doing that, you're counting your money. You don't give a shit about anyone else but yourself, Simon. Whole world doesn't revolve around you. You know, it's not always about you, you, you, you, you know that? If I want to get high, I'm going to get high, right? If you don't like it, get the fuck out of here. [SINGING] Everything we felt fell [MUSIC PLAYING] Mommy? What is your problem? You're fucking up, dude. You all right, boy? Jennifer! Jennifer! Hey! Hey! Get off me! The fuck off me! Let go! Fuck. [RADIO CHATTER] All I'm saying is own up to your shit, that's all. I can't believe I'm hearing this. Come on, Trace. You fucked up. Oh, I fucked up? You sell acid. You don't think that eventually someone's going to have a problem with it? Wait. You're blaming me for what happened tonight? You must be joking. I'm not joking! Jennifer, I tried to warn him. He wouldn't listen. Simon makes his own decisions. You know that as well as anybody. And you had nothing to do with it tonight? I don't know what happened tonight. All I know is it seemed like something he was going to go through sooner or later. You know what, Trace? That's something that you would say. I'd like to see Simon Harris. I'm his father. Hi, I'm Kate Matthews. I'm Simon's counselor. Good. I understand my son is here. We'd like to see him. I'm sorry that's not possible. Wait a minute. What do you mean it's not possible? What do we do here? What do we-- do we need a court order? Matt, wait. Here's a form Simon completed when he checked in. Line eight, "Do you want us to contact your parents?" Answer, no. Line nine, "Do you want visitation from your parents?" answer, no. Simon is an adult. He doesn't have to see you if he doesn't want to. There must be something we can do. Well, you can stay and go through our family program if you like. Family program. It's out of the question. Suit yourself. We'll get a lawyer. We'll be back here in an hour. Come on. No. Matt, we've got to stay. Laura, what are we going to stay for? For what? This is-- what are you going to do, sit around with a bunch of doctors examining our inner child? I'm not a doctor. Oh, that's even better. Matt, if you and I don't stay here now and try and solve this, it will not go away. OK. Matt, Simon, you're up. Who would like to begin? I'll begin. I stole a lot of stuff. I mean, a lot more than I was caught for. And I lied to you. I lied to Lauren a lot. I smoked pot. I drank. I did acid. Is that all? No. That money that I brought to the dinner table the other night, that wasn't from selling T-shirts or food. That was-- We knew that. Let Simon continue without interrupting. I sold acid, dad. You know what it is, though? I was trying to-- I am-- I am trying to find something, you know? Mr. Harris, is there anything you'd like to share with Simon? I certainly knew about all the drugs, and I'm happy that he's able to admit to these things. I'm sure it's not easy. Why are you talking to me? talk to Simon. I look forward to you coming home so that we can take care of all of this by ourselves. Is there anything you would change if you could do it all over again? Well, I'm sure everybody's got things they would like to change. Everybody makes mistakes. Dad, what mistakes did you make? Simon, be quiet. No, that's-- it's all right, Kate. I-- I suppose I could have been a better father. And a better husband to mom, right? What? Do you want me to say it? You got with her before mom even died. What? You know what, I walked in, I saw her. How can you fucking deny it? I'll deny it. It's absolutely not true. It never happened. What have they been telling you here? You know, you're all turned around here you don't even know what you're saying. Simon, sit down now! Kate, I saw-- Simon, sit down. People that love each other, they don't cheat, dad. They protect each other. They treat each other right. That's right. In a perfect world, that's what people should do. But this is not a perfect world. And even people that you love don't treat you right either. Simon, everybody made mistakes here. Who made the fucking mistake? Who made the mistakes? He fucking made the mistakes. My own fucking dad, that's who. You know what, Simon, you want so desperately for your mother to be a saint. How can you say that? Simon, sit down now! How can you fucking say that? How can you fucking say that, you fucking asshole? Fuck you all! Fuck you all! [MUSIC PLAYING] You've been trying to do everything, have you? Mommy? Mommy, where's daddy? Where is daddy? Simon, get out of here! Get out of here! Help! How could you do this? Get out of the house. No! Come on. What about Simon? I'll take care of Simon. You should have thought of that before! No! You know, for maybe the first time in his life, Simon told the truth in there. Well, I don't know what he's been telling you here. But what he said in there was not the truth. Well, tell me what happened. I mean, did you two have an affair? Absolutely not. No. So why does Simon think that? You know Simon's mother died, and it affected all of us. I think Matt is always blaming himself for his wife's-- Lauren, please. Be useful, Matt. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Come down off your throne and leave your body alone. Somebody must change. You are the reason I've been waiting so long. Somebody holds the key. But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time. And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home. But I can't find my way home. I didn't expect to see you here. I didn't come here to fight. I'm not going to stay long. Well, you can. If you want to. Look, dad, I just wanted to tell you-- needless to say, I-- I made a lot of mistakes, dad. Me too. Here you go. I hope you enjoy. Thank you. She could stir fry. So I finished rehab. I was thinking maybe I could get a job outside, maybe cooking or something. Maybe. Then college. I don't know. I don't know how I'm going to swing things right now, Jennifer. I don't know how I'm going to take them, but I really need your help. Could you please dry the rice? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Hi. [SINGING] Even after all the murdering, even after all, yeah, the sufferings so. You know I love you so, you know I love you so and so, even after all. I'll let you go on, it's the order of the day. In all that you believe, sir, it's all that in this society. You know I love you so, you know I love you so and so, even after all. Even after all, the murdering that go on, even after all, oh, no, yeah, suffering so. You know I love you so, you know I love you so and so, even after all. You just survive, soldier, and his soul is beautiful. And your soul-- Driving down the highway miles from home. It's been that way since they started to roam. This is what we wanted, hey, look what we got. Leave that little town behind and move on and move on. Yeah, the trees line the highway as we roll down the road. At the wheel 12 tons of steel can be quite loaded. In the distance the city lights are starting to glow. Sit back and watch them glimmer, they're starting to grow. Sit back. [MUSIC PLAYING]
