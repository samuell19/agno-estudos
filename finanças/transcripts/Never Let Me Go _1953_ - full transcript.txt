Here's where the story really begins. This is Moscow, Victory Day. Just a few years ago. A lot's happened since then. I had covered the war, now I was to cover the peace.. ...what there was of it. My job was to write it. My friend Steve Quillan's job was to broadcast it. 'There are probably a million victory-happy Russians' involved in this monster shindig. If you're a Muscovite and aren't watching, your marching. Or driving a tank, or blowing a tuba right here. Of course, the main attraction as always at these Red Square demonstrations is that beloved comrade, that father of all the Russians 'Joe Stalin himself.' Stalin...the great Russian Nero. Put it back for heaven's sake. Broadcasted? I've done nothing-- Due to circumstances beyond our control Mr. Steve Quillan's broadcast was temporarily interrupted. He will now resume. If there was any misunderstanding on the part of my overseas listeners that I referred to Comrade Stalin as the Great Russian Nero, blame it on static. Of course, we all know the word should be"hero" Not Nero. - You can't win. - Not win? An American expression. The only way to figure the Russians is to put 2 and 2 together make 9, add 7, divide by 4...and give up. Delightful. You might also say, the Russian bear is the only animal that can eat his honey and have it. Russian expression. That was the last time the flags of the free nations were marched across the Red Square in Moscow. Yup, for 24 hours on VE-Day in Moscow everybody loved everybody. Even Uncle Joe was happy. He ordered a command performance of Swan Lake at the Bolshoi Theatre. And this was one of Jo Stalin's commands I was pleased to accept. But my real reason for fighting my way through the victory mob wasn't Joseph Stalin's command.. ...you'll see why when I get in there. If I ever do. On the stage, before the performance Steve was broadcasting an overseas interview with the prima ballerina of all Russia. I started looking for a swan. For the number four swan to be exact. And then I saw her. Her name is Marya. Fell in love with her two years back. She knows it too. She looks at me like that, every time. I've sent her dozens of notes, flowers. I've turned on my best Russian for her. But it's got me nowhere. No date, no love...no nothing. 'I'm sure that my overseas listeners' 'must've heard that swans have no voice.' But perhaps, a miracle can take place on this miraculous victory night in Moscow. Now, do any of you young swans speak English? I have known the English. - What's your name? - I am Marya. - Marya Lamarkina. - Good. - And which swan are you? - I am number four swan. And when will you be number one? Perhaps, when I'm good enough to be. Well, I'm making a broadcast to England and America. Have you anything to say on this great victory night? Yes, I have great admiring for the American. I give the American my love. May we be friends in peace as we are in war. Thank you, very much. The number four swan has spoken. And is now in the hands of a swan keeper. Now, shortly.. You scared me over there, I thought you were talking to me. I was. I love you now one year, that is why I learn English. Are you sure you know what you're saying? I study English, so I can tell you how I feel. For six month when you send the flowers, I like you. I miss you. When you go the battle, I pray. It's forbidden, but I pray anyway. Because something has happened. But I-I wait for the English so I can tell you the next time you ask me to go with you. The next time? After the ballet. - Tonight. - Yes. Where would you like to go? Night club? Don't you wish to be alone together? 'Marya!' She is Valentina Alexandrovna. She, how do you say.. Watches and reports. - Reports what? - What she hears and sees. Then I shouldn't kiss you goodbye. That will come later, tonight. It was said that Stalin arrived with all the Soviet moguls. That all the ambassadors were there. That the ballet was triumphant. But all I could see that night was the number four swan. Marya. The sky rockets had nothing on me. We escaped the victory mob to the Park of Culture and Rest. Marya and I weren't looking for culture or a rest. But we did wanna be alone. Do I please you? As I've never been pleased before. - You have loved many? - Made love, sure. Loved? None. You are old enough to have loved. Yes, I know it, I was beginning to think it was me. But I never wanted anything half-baked. Half-baked? It means not right, not ready.. Your Russian, it is better than my English. Is perfect, you have no accent. We'll speak it if you want to. No, I study English very hard to make you happy. You think I have it ready yet for marriage good enough? - Marriage? To who? - Kiss me again, please. You could teach me what I do not know. Why did you mention marriage a moment ago? I make the deciding. Now at least, one year. I told you that is why I needed the English. So we can get married? Have you discussed this with your folks? They're gone since I had eight years. Since you were eight years old? - They died? - No. They put me in ballet school and go away. And you don't know where they are? They did I think, something the Party did not like. I was too young to know. I remember they cried and went away. I never did see my father cry before. I still cry when I remember. Exile. And you've been alone ever since. No, I have many friends in the ballet school. We grow up together. Well, if you were married, wouldn't you miss them? Miss them? I would not stop dancing. I see. And I would teach our childrens how to dance also. Dancing gives them pretty bodies. You want our childrens to have pretty bodies, yes? No? That's like asking a man how often he beats his wife. If I am naughty, then I deserve it. - Beat me. - You think I would? It is not the American custom? They put guys in jail for that in my hometown. - San Francisco. - How'd you know? I learnt how to read on you. Where was I? Valentina found me all about you from some place. What else do you know? San Francisco has an opera house. I will dance there. And our childrens will play in the in the park of the Golden Gate. Is it as nice as this? I'm trying to picture someplace that wouldn't be nice if you're being in it. ...hold me close and want me. I want you so terrible, so long. Alright, I'm seeing Molotov on Monday, I'll tell him. Come in, Sutherland. Sorry I kept you waiting. - Ambassador. - Sit down. I have a Papillon. They're, holding up my latest consignment of American cigarettes just to annoy me. - The pinpricks of diplomacy. - Have one of mine, sir. - Russian? - Yeah, it is. You're a good fellow, Sutherland. I'll mention you in dispatches. Well, what is it this time? They're tapping your telephone, or cutting your stuff to pieces? - Tell me the worst. - I want to get married, sir. Well, congratulations. Who's the lucky girl? - Her name is Marya. - 'Marya?' Marya Lamarkina. Yes, sir, she's Russian. I'm not gonna ask you if you know what you're doing, Philip 'cause you must. You've been in Moscow long enough to know that one of the foolish things a foreigner and a Russian girl can do, is fall in love. 'Most foolish of all, is to marry. Wouldn't you say that?' I have said it, sir. Over and over. - To the young woman? - To her and to myself. I'm sorry, Sutherland, but I'll have to see her and warn her off officially. She's here now, sir. This is Marya. - Who is the face? - The portrait. An American. Name of Lincoln. - Good man? - Pretty good. Now, my dear, it is my duty to warn you-- You don't wish for Philip to be my man. 'It's not a question of what I wish, dear--' The Soviet. They do not wish either. But I wish very much. They can make things very difficult for you. Sir...I have love for Philip. I have the wish to be his wife and be together with him always. You will tell us, no, no. But we say, yes, yes. And then you will say.. Dashed young fools. ...and then you will say, "Dashed young fools, good luck." - No? Yes? - 'Not as simple as that.' You must realize, there is no certainty you'd be granted an exit visa. Why they not give me the visa? I am nobody. 'You're Russian. He's American.' We go together. 'They may not permit it, my dear.' You must understand, both of you you may be together for just six months. Then for six months, we will be together. I have the wish to be the woman to Philip for always but if only for six months... then better for six months than never to be the woman to Philip at all. And so, we were married in the American embassy. The ambassador's wife was there for Marya and I had Steve Quillan though, at my end. There were just the five of us, and old Abe Lincoln up there on the wall. It was comforting having him there. I had the hope that no matter what the Kremlin thought of our marriage, he would say as he once did "It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this." For our honeymoon, we went to Tallinn on the Baltic sea where all summer long the water is so warm night-bathing is a favorite sport. Except perhaps for honeymooners. We wanted to be alone. It cost one ticket to get up here. This is a fine time to tell me. Who sells 'em? - I? - You? What do I pay and how much? You not pay, you say. Something like.. ...I love you. How you know what it cost to get on this raft? - You have been before? - Nope. And I'm new at honeymoons. But from what I have seen so far, it's a great idea. Am I a good bride? Are you pleased with me? Can you feel my heart pushing? It's like little animal. Has much movement. Listen to mine. It's like bigger animal in a cage. Has more moving than mine even. You know what it says? I want to get out. I want to get out. I want to get out. Shipwrecked? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. - Have you been here long? - Since before you came. Why, you're an American. I say, fancy meeting an American. Look, pal, we're on our honeymoon. How very nice. I'm on my second. One up on you. Your second honeymoon? In that row boat? No. Well, that is in a way yes. You see, I thought I might meet my wife here. Of course she doesn't know it. Do you usually meet her in a row boat? No, never. Then she doesn't know you're here. But that will spoil everything. You see, I don't swim. And his wife's a mermaid. Certainly is, swims like a fish, Svetlana does. Svetlana? You are her English. I am Marya, Marya Lamarkina. To who she gave the English. She tells you this, yes? No? Ha ha, I know who is this man. He is Svetlana's English from the war. He is back from the Cornwall. He gets her. Yes, from Cornwall, England. - I've been there-- - Svetlana. Darling. Marya. Svetlana. Here is Philip, my man. Philip mushka,this is she who teach me the English Svetlana Mikhailovna. They have big dream now to have 14 childrens like five-year plan. However, I want to thank you for-- You will meet my English. Denny, this is Marya's Philip. Hi, of course, I'd be only too delighted. How do you do? - How do you do? - How do you do! We have a two room apartment in Moscow. We're not looking too far ahead just yet. We have each other, that's all we want. Let the future take care of itself. That's how Svetlana felt and it worked out perfectly. After my discharge from the Tank Corps I went to Cornwall and got us a little cottage. Within a month we shall be happily settled there. They promised your wife a visa? We applied for it the day we were married, it takes time. That's why we are here now waiting for it and enjoying our second honeymoon meanwhile. She's quite a gal. See, tell me, how come you two got married? Ha. Vodka. Vodka? That's right, that's what did it. Vodka. You mean you were drunk? Absolutely, old boy, blotto. Pickled. Tight as a tick. You see, during the war I wasn't really a soldier. I was a Sergeant who knew about engines. Anyway, about 18 months before war's end they sent me 'out here to demonstrate some of our new tanks.' 'Churchills they were.' After one of these demonstrations there was a party given by the Russian Sergeants. You know the sort of thing lots of noise, speeches and so forth. I didn't know the lingo so I haven't the foggiest notion what it was all about. They gave me an interpreter. To the health of our British cousin. Christopher Wellington St. John Denny. Christopher Wellington St. John Denny. Well, I, that is, was very decent of you...and thanks. Or rather, tanks. British humor can't be translated. Yes, well, cheerio. And Reievich Sergeev who invented the tank. I'm awfully sorry. But the tank was largely a British invention. A man called Douglas Barrington Jones.. ...realized that it was absolutely-- Da. Constantine Mojastavich Popoff who invented the electric light. ...alright. After 22 incredibly preposterous toasts. To Timothy Ivanovich Semenov who invented the internal combustion engine. This is ridiculous. To Vladimir.. ...who invented the aeroplane. I don't want to contradict you, but.. ...actually-- Well. Sergei Nikolaevich Batukin who invented Russian national vegetable, the potato. The potato was a British invention. I give you the man who discovered the potato. I give you that great Englishman Sir Francis Drake. And another thing I'd like.. And two weeks later we were married. I think these are dry enough to put on now. Your name is Denny? - Yes. - You are Sutherland? Today you take pictures with your camera? Yes, of my wife. Yes. And of the beach of Tallinn? Perhaps in the background of-- If so, it was quite by chance. Where is your camera? At our cabin. Look here, during the war I helped your people for two rather miserable years. I feel I deserve a decent-- You will dress now and come with us please. This is your house Mr. Sutherland? We've rented it for our honeymoon. Your papers please. - You're from the NKVD? - Of course. Marya Lamarkina? You find it...pleasing to be married to an American? I do. We have much love for each other. 'You will speak in Russian to me please.' Or have you already forgotten our language? You speak to me in English. I wish to be courteous, that is all. In the Soviet it is better to be courteous in Russian. You will come with me now please. You too. Well, goodbye, Marya. It's been a great pleasure meeting you. Same to you. And if things get balled up, we'll look after Svetlana. Thanks, old man. We are, as the saying goes...expecting. They will send him away. And when the baby comes, she will be alone. No, when they develop the pictures they'll see he told the truth. They'll see what they want to see. The beaches, the coast line. They will send him away. I think it better for you never to have known me and love me. Marya. I think it better for me never to love you. If only for six months, you said you wanted to be. I do. Forgive me, I love you so much. But they have given me fear. - Of what? - That they will come again. That they will do to us, what I know they will do to them. They will send her Denny away. And they will give her no visa. I know. It just takes time that's all. You know how it is with red tape. And naturally, the Reds have more and redder tape than most. That's a joke, honey. Well, at least they haven't refused her a visa. They never refuse. They never say, "You stay here. You belong to the Soviet. You not go with your man." They never say it. To say yes. To say no. To say anything. That is not their way. Their way is to say nothing. Just the silence. No answer, no visa. I know this. - How do you know? - I have the fear. That's not going to happen to us, sweetheart. Not to us. I'm in good standing. You know the press has influence in many places. We know how to pull strings. When the time comes for me to go you go with me or I don't go at all. Not that anyone is going any place yet. Remember, you husband is supposed to be a specialist in Russian affairs. I'm too valuable to transfer, maybe for years. It's too bad that Svetlana's husband Mr. Denny is valuable...only to her. She will be very lonely when the baby comes. We'll watch out for her. I promised him that. Marya's hunch was right. They shipped Denny out for good. Their son was born in our apartment in Moscow. Da.Just like his papa. We will have 14 like him. And when my visa comes, we will have twins not to lose time. Have they promised a visa to England? No, but they still haven't refused. Philip mushka. Well, we've had it. What does it mean? We fly out of here on Saturday. But it say "request Russian Authorities." What is that? I guess, they didn't like the piece I wrote on the beginning of a cold war. Their growing hostility to free nations. I was afraid, Philip. I asked you to lie a little. Even if it was true. You start lying a little and pretty soon you're lying big like they are. Start packing, honey. Break the news to, Svetlana. She can have this place. I'm off to get your visa if I have to climb the Kremlin walls to do it. I decided to send a personal plea to Stalin. I already knew the answer. So, I set out to plead with, badger or browbeat every living soul in Moscow, Russian or otherwise into getting a passport for my wife. I made the rounds with the minor officials who were polite, but non committal. Made a pitch to our Ambassador who promised to raise the matter personally with Molotov in the unlikely event of his ever seeing him again. I tried Steve Quillan whose top radio reporting on overseas network had frequently opened up doors which were locked to the rest of us. Steve had got nowhere. Finally.. Frankly, Kuragin, I've pulled every string I could and nothing happens and I know why. Because all the strings leads to this office, to you. I suppose you figure your government has nothing to gain by giving my wife a visa. That only we can benefit and we mean nothing. Look, Kuragin, I'm a Yankee, I don't beg easily. I'm begging now. Five gets me two, I'm wasting my time, time's precious I only have two days left. When I fly outta here Saturday, I want my wife, Kuragin. I want her with me. If it suits you to help me, you'll help me. If not, not. I have no hope at all that it'll suit you. So, why not give me a clear flat no and let me get outta here. You are a reporter, Sutherland. During the war you were a good one. You were trained to be objective. I wonder if it's possible for you to be objective now just for a moment. I realize it's hard for an American even for one who has spent four years in Russia like you have to understand our point of view. Yet, it's simple. It's logical. It's realistic. Suppose we permit our women to leave Russia to inter-marry with the West America. They're good Communists therefore they'll become bad Americans. Or they'll become good Americans therefore they are bad Communists. Either way no one is satisfied. Face the issue squarely, Sutherland you'll see at once there can be logically only one answer. I'm not going to argue logic with you, Kuragin. I won't ask what madness, what neurotic fear is driving you to interpret the humblest needs of the human heart as an affair of state. I won't even ask what demon is driving you to take the goodwill of the world and deliberately strangle it overnight. Let's face the issue. The way you want it. Look at it smack in the eye. You know what I see? The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics riding headlong down the road marked this way to the jungle. Via man's inhumanity to man. We fought a war to blow that road sky-high. Or am I confused? Not confused, Sutherland. Merely naive. East is east and west is west. Seems to me, they met on the Allied front a short while back. The war is past. Now comes peace. She's charming. We shall miss her. And by the way, tell your wife's friend who married the Englishman. She will receive hers as soon as her child is old enough to travel. The only way...to figure the Russian mind is to put two and two together make nine, add seven, divide by four and give up. My respects to your wife. I'm sure she will be very happy. Tovarisch,for the journey. Pravda, Izvestia. Report of the Water Supply and Sewage Trust. Illustrated Christmas Number, 1937. I'm American. When do you push off, Svetlana? I wait for word each day. I'll miss you, Steve. Go west, young man. Weep for the spring. No sad summers for Stalin. So long, Mrs. D. You're a mighty woman. Up and out in a week after your kid's born. Keep the chin up. And remember, we're placing a trail for you and junior. Blow a kiss to your Statue of Liberty for me. If they ask you what Russia's got that you haven't, say, "No television." Foreign nationals first, please. Americans. On board please. On board please. Philip? Philip! Marya! Marya. Let me go! I'll come back! 'I'll come back!' Philip! Philip! There were others like us. And the case of the Russian wives was taken up officially by the State Department. By Congress. By the International Press. 'Come in.' - You sent for me, John? - Yes, Phil. Last conceivable approach has been made to the Russians and no soap. What about your request to reassign me to Moscow? It appears that you're no longer acceptable to the Soviet Union. Seems their door's been slammed and bolted to you. And my wife's on the other side. While you were in Moscow did you get to Molotov about this? No. He's en route to London for a Four-Power Conference. We'll want full coverage on it. Thanks. I got to London. I got to Molotov and got nowhere. I headed for Cornwall to see Denny and found he'd received a shocking letter from his wife. "This is to tell you that I'm applying "to the Soviet Registrar for a divorce. "You'll find another girl to make you English babies and be happy. Goodbye, Svetlana." When this letter arrived I looked much angrier than you, Phil. I stood up here and wanted to jump down there. Then your friend Steve smuggled some letters through. She wrote this.. "My dearest beloved, tear up that terrible letter "the NKVD made me write to you. "They said if I did not write it "they would send me to a work camp in Kazakhstan "without our baby. "I hate them. I love you. "And all I want is to come to you. "I am with Marya. We are alone together now. Wishing with all our hearts. Always to be with you." Somehow, I can't believe that anyone would-would deliberately want to part a man and his wife forever. - No? - There's no reason for it. I mean, we haven't taken anything from their country by loving and marrying. We haven't done them any harm. I know they're suspicious by nature and that sort of thing but surely, sooner or later they must realize there's nothing to be suspicious about. Then they'll let the girls go. Don't you think? The trouble with you, Denny, is that you are a nice guy. In a world that is less than nice. I like you for it. But I'm wondering what it'll do for you. To get by these days you've got to-- Have faith. You've got to have faith. Look what I've made for my son. He'll like trundling it about the garden, won't he? I mean, I hope he'll like it. Kids always do, don't they? Sure, kids do. But will he still be a kid when you give it to him? I'm sorry, Denny. But I've been living on hopes for some months now too they're not enough. Confound it, how stupid of me. So wrapped in my own woman, forgot all about yours. We should be very grateful to your friend Steve. He's a superb smuggler-outer. These are from your Marya. - Excuse me. I.. - Of course. I read her letters over and over. She was dancing again. And dancing better than ever. 'I danced now many roles.' 'The Snow Queen in the Nutcracker Ballet.' 'I danced Zobeida in Scheherazade.' 'And now they ask me to rehearse' 'the Swan Queen in "Swan Lake."' 'My beloved.' 'They say I dance better than before, Phil mushka.' 'I think this is true.' 'Because now when I dance, I'm dancing my love for you.' 'And I dance from my heart, which is breaking.' 'Philip, my husband, you are my life.' 'Why do they keep me from you?' 'All I want, all I live for is to come to you' 'and to be with you again.' 'There must be a way. You will find it.' 'You are my man and you will come for me.' 'I love you, my Philip.' 'I shall wait for you always...forever.' Her letters brought her so close to me I knew the idea that had been forming in my mind could be made a reality. Sure it was a crazy idea. But I was living in a crazy world and had to something about it. - 'Good morning.' - Mornin'. What kind of a boat is this? 'She's Dutch. What they call Zaboya.' - What's that you're doing? - Caulking. Caulking? I've caulked the bottom. Now I'm caulking the deck. How's that again? Caulking, drivin' the wick in into the seam to stop her leaking. Ain't you never done no caulking? No, I guess not. Well, darn me. Never done no caulking. That's rare, that is. - Where are you from, mister? - San Francisco. California, USA. I'm an American. H-h! I see. Well, there you are then, yes. - You're Joe Brooks, aren't you? - Maybe I am, maybe I ain't. The board up the hill says you know everything there is to know about boats. That's young Willy. He talks out of his elbow at times. The man's not born yet, that knows everything about boats. Never will be, neither. Boats isn't like them motor cars they got where you come from, you know all slicked up and shiny. You press a button and you gets the answer. No. Boats is a different story. Boats has got souls. - Mind if I come aboard? - 'No, nobody's stopping you.' - She yours, Joe? - No. I just looks after her. Along with some of the others around here. Nice little ship. 'She's a sturdy craft alright.' 'What we call sea-kindly.' - Kind of old, isn't she? - 30 or 40 year. They don't build them like this nowadays, you know. Of course, her engine's out. You can always get another engine. It's the timber you can't get, you know it's the timber that counts. What's it like, sailing a boat like this alone? Well, that's all according to whether you knows what you're up to. If you do, you're fine and fair. If you don't, you'll drown. Suppose you wanted to sail all the way to the Baltic? Baltic? Who'd want to sail to the Baltic? - I might. - 'You might?' Of course, I know it's a long way to the Baltic, but.. It's a long way to the end of the pier in a row boat, if you don't know how to row. A man could learn, Joe. Listen, Denny, I bought me a boat. - A boat? - Yeah. Dutch sailing boat. With an engine. Well, the engine's busted at the moment. - But I'm getting a new one. - Well, that's nice. Hey, look, chum. I've got an idea. I think that you and I could sail on my boat to the Baltic and fetch Svetlana and Marya out of Russia. Don't you think it might be easier to smuggle them out in a large box? Look, I don't have any boxes. Do you know how to sail a boat, old chap? No. Not yet. Don't you? - No. I can't swim either. - Well, you won't have to. Now, listen. Here's the plan. The Moscow ballet go on tour this summer. Marya sent me the dates. She'll be in Tula at the end of May. Kharkov and Kiev in June. Minsk and Riga in July. And August 12th to the 15th.. - Where do you think? - I haven't the slightest-- Tallinn, pal. Remember, that's where we went on our honeymoon. And get this, there's one night when she is not dancing. Look, Swan Lake on the 12th. Sleeping Beauty on the 13th. Don Quixote on the 15th. Nothing at all on the night of the 14th. August the 14th. That's our D-day, brother. Yes, seems to me that Marya will be in Tallinn on the 14th of August. But will Svetlana? We'll get 'em there, we'll fix it somehow. And once they're in Tallinn together, that's a cinch. They wait till the night of the 14th walk down to the beach and go swimming. Everyone swims at night in August, remember? - Yes.. - Well, there you are. - Wh-where am I? - In a dinghy. We row in in a dinghy and pick 'em up. I tell you there's nothing to it. Look, the Russkies will be sure to spot us as soon as we get near the coast. Right? They'll sound the alarm all over the Baltic there'll probably be a scrap and all of us will be shot and drowned. Would that be any worse than what we have now? I'd as soon drown as live the rest of my life without Marya. I know, I know, it's the same with me. Then you'll come? Sorry, old chap, I can't. You've forgotten about the baby. I'll risk my own life and my wife's but not my son's. Yes, you are right. I had forgotten about the boy. You can't go pushing babies to the ocean. Forget it, partner. I reckon it's grapefruit. It comes from that there California, USA. 'I reckon it must be grapefruit, certainly ain't sailors' Mind you, he tried. I never seed anybody try harder than what he did. Just about threw hisself into it with all he hard, he did. I says to him, there you are, you see. That's what comes in getting married, I says. Never have no truck with women, I tells him. Okay, let her go. And he kept at it and at it and at it till he could handle her alone. And was he proud. Couldn't wait to round up all the maps of all the oceans he planned to cross. Come to me one evening with charts and guide books galore. All of a jitterbug he was. You know how they gets, these Americans mostly. Well, Joe, I am all set. Here's the plan. You check me as I go along and tell me if I'm crazy. Okay, so I am crazy. Now, I'm gonna sail up the North Sea along the coast of Denmark through the Goteborg Canal to Stockholm. Now, once I get to the Baltic.. Okay, if I get there I cross the Gulf of Finland after sunset and head for Tallinn. On the night of August the 14th I make for the bay right here, a few miles out, say three. Here, near Rocky Light, I anchor. 'Lower the dinghy, row in towards the shore.' 'My wife swims out to meet me, I pick her up' 'we beat it like crazy for the boat. How's that?' You gonna put all this in writing? Good grief, no, why? I was just wondering, how does she know what to do, the missus? I got in touch with Steve, a friend who's still in Moscow. He's gonna meet me in Stockholm the end of July. I give him the dope, he gives it to Marya. This is all at night, yeah? Joe, night of August the 14th. Do you mind me asking how you and the missus is gonna find each other in the dark? Fix up a signpost or something? No, there's two of them there waiting for us, Joe. Here, look here, leading lights, two of them one smack behind the other to guide shipping into the bay. This chart's 20 year old. How do you know they're still there? They were there last year. I saw them when we were there on our honeymoon. Honeymoon. Now I figure that if I row in keeping these two lights dead in line ahead of me and my wife swims out keeping these two lights dead in line behind her we can't miss. How's that for an amateur? Suppose there's a fog, suppose it's rough 'suppose there's a heavy sea running' 'who's gonna look after the boat' while you are gone off in the dinghy? You can't drop your hook in twenty fathom, you know. No, no that's a point. - It hadn't occurred to me. - There you are, you see. That's what comes of being a Yankee Doodle. You're all A-one and hunky-dory above the waterline but underneath, where it really matters why, you're leaking away like a sieve. Well? Wh-what? What're you gonna do about it? I don't know. I have to think. Looks as if I shall have to come with you, don't it? What? Why, Joe. Tides coming full, if we want to clear with it we better get a move on. You think I'll have time to say, "So long" to Denny? 'Look's as if he's coming to wish us luck hisself.' Denny, you're coming along! Why, you ol' sea-going son of a gun, this is great. But what about the boy? He's dead. About a week ago. Letter just got through. Svetlana says he caught cold. Developed a fever. It's quite sudden, apparently. I never saw him, you know. They shouldn't keep a man from seeing his son. All set? I reckon so, barring the usual. "They must goes down to the sea in ships "and does business in great waters "these sees the works of the Lord "and his wonders in the deep. "He commandeth and raiseth the storm "so they reel to and fro "and stagger like a drunken man "but they cry unto the Lord "and he maketh the sea calm. "Then are they glad because they be quiet. And so he bringeth them unto their desired haven." We hope. Okay, let's go. We left the channel behind and set our course across the North Sea for Goteborg, Sweden en route to Stockholm and our rendezvous with Steve. If we didn't make it, we and our plan were dead. Denny and I could think only of Stockholm and whether Steve could make it. On the morning of the 25th of July we sided the Swedish capital and by noon we were approaching the Yacht Club the place of rendezvous with Steve. - I don't speak Swedish. - Beg your pardon. - What can I do for you? - I'm Sutherland. I think you have a message for me. Sutherland. No, sir, there's nothing for Sutherland. There must be some mistake. Check it again, will you? There's nothing here, sir. - No message of any kind? - I'm sorry, sir. But I'll make a note that you're expecting a message. If you care to tell us where we can reach you.. - Mr. Sutherland. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hi, Admiral. - 'How's the ocean these days?' - Steve. 'That's a fancy line of pullovers you're wearing.' 'I am not sure about that cap though.' 'Looks kind of silly from where I'm standing.' - From where you are.. - 'Turn around..' '-other way.' Hi. Better face the desk, Phil. This town's alive with Uncle Joe's hatchet men. If you're up to what I think you're up to.. I am. 'Then we're never to be seen canoodling, now or ever.' That way we look younger, live longer. - No long knives. - 'I have to talk to you.' That's what I am here for. Now kindly step into the booth next door and call Stockholm, 4-6-9-3-1-2. - Who's there? - 'I am.' Hi. Steve, can we talk? Sure, they can't tap booth to booth. Well, you guessed it. Denny and I are on our way to fetch our women only they don't know it yet. We got a plan, but no contacts. That's where you come in, I hope. Now here's the layout. - You with me? - Shoot. Today, then, every ninth word. Gee, Steve, that's great if it works. If it works? It's a cinch. With some luck we'll be in touch up to the night of the 14th. 'You need a radio that's good and loud.' - We got one. - 'Then you're in business.' I don't know why you should do this, Steve? Stick your chin out like this for us. Maybe I'm tired of watching Uncle Joe push people around. I got to go now, sonny boy. Now, keep your eye on the ball and remember I'll say today then every ninth word. - Every ninth word. - Check. Now, you hang up first. Good luck, Phil. Who you talking to, Steve? Everything alright? - All is well, I think. - Good. Hello, London. Hello, London. 'Hello, London.' 'This is Steve Quillan calling you from Moscow.' 'Today, I'm going to talk to you about music in Soviet Russia.' In. 'The war hasn't destroyed the touch of the Russian musician..' Touch. '...nor impaired his skill with every kind..' With. - 'Men, women, boys and girls..' - Girls. '...flock to concerts in the capital, which are developing..' Developing. ...and using musical philosophy according to a definite plan. We of the western world regard music largely as entertainment. 'But the Russians think otherwise.' 'They have agreed to compose their music..' Agreed. '...in accordance with the exact requirement..' Exact. '...of the modern communist government.' From time to time perhaps one or other of their leading composer's will.. Will. '...which somehow fails to follow this..' Follow. '...in Russian music' then he is in trouble. You may be quiet sure in his next composition he will conform strictly to the Marxist message. "In touch with girls. "Developing plan as agreed. Exact time will follow your next message." It worked. Trouble ahead. We'll bring in the sails now. Hello, London. This is Steve Quillan calling you from Leningrad. 'A strong wind is whipping up across the Bay of Finland.' 'And our hearts are with those men out on the stormy waters.' 'Today has been a strenuous one. I had this swimming..' Swimming. '...at the party given by..' Party. '...Society for Agricultural Research.' Ten separate groups were there to report on their special achievements. P. Shuralov reported the great progress made in Leningrad. - 'M. Bissinger..' - M. '...transmitted the greetings of his group, 14th collective..' 14th. Don't worry, Joe, We're all set. "Swimming party 10 p.m., 14th." We might be swimming before that. Turn back! We're riding right into the thick of it. No, hold your cords. We can't turn back. The guards are on their way. Help me lower the foresail or we'll all be blown to kingdom come. Start bailing. By the next day the storm had passed. We made our way along the islands on the coast of Finland. Found a place to hide. We still had 52 miles to go but this was the 13th. The storm had blown us in a little ahead of schedule. Tomorrow was D-day. - Think she'll hold? - If it don't get no worse. What's next, skipper? Something to eat and then sleep. Your women are lyin' off across there, I hope. We should be alright here. And you'll need all the sleep you can get for what lies ahead tonight. Good morning. Good morning. - Who are you? - May I ask the same question? - We're on a vacation. - Then what are you doing here? This is not a vacation place, bad anchorage. We like it alright, mate. Aye, what's that for mate? The Lieutenant doesn't speak English. He's tying our boat to yours. I think he has lost our anchor. You're Russians. 'But these are Finnish waters?' Don't the Finns, mind you patrolling their waters? The Finns are our friends. We help them. You stay here long? That depends...on the weather. What will you do while you are here? Swim, eat, sleep, lie in the sun. You will lie only in the sun? You intend to cross the Gulf, for instance? - What's over there? - Tallinn. Tallinn? How far is it? Says on the charts. You keep charts? We did till the storm put us awash, soaked everything. Anyway, we like to avoid ports and towns. We like to get away from people. Aha, you like to get drunk maybe? I do. Yes, back in England they called me the man with the hollow leg. What this means? That I can drink more than anybody. This is not so. The Russian can drink more than anybody. No, I mean, are you a real drinker? One who drinks, anytime like...now? Of course! Splendid. If you'll get the glasses, ol' boy. Come on. And you, your leg is also hollow? No, mate, with me it's ulcers. Then we just have to outdrink 'em ditch 'em. If they outdrink us, how does the boat get to Tallinn? - Sail itself and tow us? - Joe doesn't drink. Here, drink some of this salad oil. Coats your stomach. Come on. It's like putting a horseshoe in a boxing glove. At least this is whisky, not that vicious vodka. Salad oil settled? I don't know, if it stays down. Come on, bring those quickly. There you are, you see. They know about my ulcers, only four glasses. To all hearty drinkers. - Phoo! - Too strong for ya? Whisky, pah! We will drink vodka, Russian Vodka! Come! Hey, you, you too. That will kill your ulcers. Come! It's an order. I'm awfully sorry, ol' boy, but if he comes, we stay. Yes, you see, he's our paid hand, our...our servant. Who's a servant? Give me-- One never takes a member of one's staff with one to parties. 'It just isn't done, really.' It's insult to one's host, you know, all that sort of a thing. A-Class distinction. I don't like them either, Western imperialists. Yes. Maybe vodka will make them humble. Come! Sit. What might this be? We keep score. Now we shall see who is the drinker. Pour. This is vodka, Russian Vodka. You will find it strong like Russia. - First, your names. - Golden Gates. Gates. Yes, I have heard this name. - And yours? - Wesley Cornwall. - Your profession? - I make toys. Toys? You have a factory? Big factory. 1000 workers. Make toy wheelbarrows. Capitalist. Capitalist. And you, what you do? Nothing. I don't have to. I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Your mouth? Silver spoon? This I...I do not-- I was a freak. I give the toast. To our beloved Comrade Stalin. To our beloved Comrade Stalin. Hurrah! So this is vodka. Well, well, well.. Burns down all the way, no? - No. - No? Sorry, ol' boy. No punch, no kick, no...wham. Looks like water, tastes like water. When the bottles are empty we shall see. Pour! I make the toast. My turn, my jolly ol' turn. I make the toast. To Constantine Mojastavich Popoff who invented the electric light. Popoff. Elektrichestvo. - Come on. - Yeah. Constantine Mojastavich Popoff, hurrah! Here we go. To, Vladimir Alexievich Yermolov who invented the aeroplane. Vladimir Alexievich Yermolov, hurrah! To Timothy Ivanovich Semenov who invented the internal combustion engine. Timothy Ivanovich Semenov, hurrah. We've forgotten...Potato Dear ol' Potato Sergei Nikolaevich Potato.. ...who invented the patootie, hurrah. No, no, Batutin who invented the potato. Sergei Nikolaevich Ba-tu-tin.. And another thing.. ...it was Sir Francis Drake. Well, there you are, I see. - 'Joe?' - Aye aye, mate. Where are we? In the middle of the Gulf of Finland. Did you drink that black coffee I left beside your bunk? Yeah. What happened to the Russian patrol boat? After I put you two warriors to bed I opened their petcocks and dumped their fuel into the bay. Then I cut 'em loose and shoved off. If they want to get anywhere now, they'll have to row. How long before we lay off Tallinn? About four hours to the buoy. Good. That'll give me time to rejoin the human race. You look half human already. We anchor at the buoy right here. - Yeah. - Joe stays aboard. You and I get in the dinghy and row in for the inshore navigation lights right here. I'm not very good at rowing a boat, you know. I know, I'll row. You just keep me on course because the girls will be waiting for us right here. 'Douse that light.' The buoy dead ahead. - Where do you want to be? - In the stern. Try to spot the inshore lights. We should be back about 11. Well, God bless you. Shh. - Coffee, Svetlana? Here, cold? - Here, dear. Far behind? Marya? Not coming. Not here. Not here? - Where is she? - At the theater. But there is no show tonight, this is the 14th. Zhdanov is here suddenly. The General. They give a special performance for him. A gala. - What time did it start? - At nine. And it's still on? - I'm gonna get her. - You're out of your mind. You've no identification papers. If they ask who you are, they-- I'm not going back without Marya. It's both or neither. Now, listen carefully. Take Svetlana to the boat. 'Tell Joe to come back here in the dinghy, alone.' He's to wait until one o'clock. That's the deadline. Understand? 'If we're not here by one, he's to go back to the boat' and race like blazes for Stockholm. - Now listen, Phil. - This is no time to argue. Hang around here and we'll all go down the drain. Take care of yourselves. Good luck. I headed up the hill to the Theater Square. First I had to find out who I was. A colonel. Red Army Medical Corps. Not bad, but our faces didn't match. And there was the theater... it was intermission time. The signs read, "Reserved for officers and guests only." I headed for the stage door. My plan was, first, to get in. Then find Marya and make a run for it...or something. I didn't quite know. But the plan blew up in my face. The guards would ask for my papers and my face wouldn't match. There was only one solution. To get in through the crowd. 'Marya?' Hello? Listen, sweetheart. I'm here in the theater. I'm going into the audience. 'We're going to be together tonight, someway, somehow.' 'So wait for that moment. Be ready.' General. Doctor? Sutherland! You are the husband, Philip Sutherland. Keep your mouth shut and you're the next Swan Queen. I ordered him to stop at a pharmacy. Come up front, darling. Sorry, honey, we're out of luck. I'm gonna stop. - No, no. They would kill you. - But not you. At least there's a chance they won't this way. This way is together. Together beloved. Whatever comes I want it together. Alright, together. One way or another. We're headed for the drink, the bay. Strip off your costume. Unlatch your door, sweetheart. Standby to crash. Start swimming as soon as we hit. They have search lights. We have to swim further. Quickly. Hold on to Marya till I can help you. Are the Russkies far behind us? They're lookin' for the bodies. Joe...this is my wife. I rather imagined that. But you're ten minutes late, you know? Thank you for waiting.
