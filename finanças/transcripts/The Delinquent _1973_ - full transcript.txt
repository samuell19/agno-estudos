Are you joking? Of course. Send 2 informers to Wing Kee Warehouse. Let's steal from there. Mind your own business. Just take a look Wing Kee Warehouse... ...is in charge by John's father. John. The delivery boy. We just fought with him. Right? Right. It seemed like... ...you didn't get any advantages. If the police hadn't come... ...we would have killed him already. Am I right? Right. If the delivery boy is John... ...it would be him who had killed you. This guy is something. Ask him to see me. Go on. Yes, I understand. I will reward you if he can come. Good. Let's go! Dad, I bought some food for you. Why didn't you go to work? You have been laid off again? Jobs are everywhere. No big deal. You won't find a job with this attitude. I bought you food. You lost temper again. I don't want it. I want you to work hard Hello! What are you doing? No bad, right? John. Can I help you? She is not talking to you. Your mom misses you. You miss me.

What do you want? If this lady spends a night with us... ...then we are even. Spend one night... Ignore them. Don't! Don't fight with them. Go... Stop... John... Stop now! Let's split. Don't fight. Stop! John... I know what you think. This boy, John, fights well. Stop it! Just give him some money... ...and a woman. I don't think so. Didn't you see his face? This kind of teenagers... thought they were heroes in the movies. He wants perfection. He is a big hero. John, forget it! Stop! Come with me. Go and see your mom. No. She thinks Dad is poor... ...and re-married to the butcher. What does she want from me? Your Dad had bad temper. She was beaten and bruised... ...almost every other day. Everyone knew that. Dress up like that and go out everyday. I have to hit you. You dare? Stop! My Dad has bad temper... ...because he has a tough life. It's not what he wants. I will earn money. Make a comfortable life for him. I will never forgive that woman. John, get a decent job. And work like a dog? The money I earn... ...is less than the tips for prostitutes John. John. I have been looking for you. Owner of the restaurant said you... Big deal! I will mind my own business. Do you want to make extra money? Follow me to see Big Sean. I have nothing to do with him. He is looking for you. What I think is... ...you don't know what happiness is. Follow me. You will be better off. What future does a delivery boy have? What do you say? Okay. Go. Again. John has come. Where is Big Sean? Wait here. I will call him. Brother. What's up? He has come. You are John. You want some fun? Let's get into business later. Take your time. Love me. Hello. Who is it? Lam please. Hold on. Who is it? I am Big Sean, Boss. What's up? I have found a informer. Wing Kee Warehouse. Wing Kee Warehouse. The watcher is Mr. Sum. He is a tough guy. We have found his son. His name is John. John. The one in the drain... ...who fought well the other clay? Yes, that's him. He has a girlfriend called Elaine. Maybe. But now... ...he is with my girl. Everything is out of his mind. Even his mom. I will keep you informed. Good. Honey, in big cities... ...you can make money if you are clever. I don't think so. It's stealing. No matter what. If it works, it's good. Can't the bodyguards... leave you for a second? You are my bodyguard. You have to be with me all the time. You are pervert. Did you see a lot Bond's movies? Who is it? How? He was like an animal last night. Now, he is exhausted to death. Thank you. Morning. Morning. How is it? Not bad. We have girls prettier than her. What do you want? I only know to fight. But you already have a lot of fighters. Phoenix is better than I. We are not asking for that. Just do one thing... ...and you can have everything. Your Dad is Wing Kee's watcher. Think of a way... You may take him to a movie... ...while he was on duty. I want the key of the warehouse. What do you want? Don't be naive. After a movie... 3 truckloads of goods can be taken away. You can at least have $3,000. No, I won't do it. What do you mean? The warehouse is taken care by my Dad. The goods inside are not his. What is the problem? After this heist... ...there is one more. When you have the money... ...you can ask your Dad to quit. You are not dumb. Forget it. I can promise you anything... ...except this. ...or sad either. Stay away. Stop. That means you don't have to pay? Sorry. When I have the money... ...I will return to you. This slap is to pacify you. I will give you the money. If you fight here... ...it's no good for you. Have you made up your mind? No way. Stop him. Go. Come on. What do you say? No. I won't do it. Okay, I am sorry. Just hit me. Think about it. We will come back. Go... This way... It's you again. Who are you fighting with? Do you want us to ask your Dad... ...to bail you out? Last time your Dad said... ...he would not bail you out again. We are not sure if he would come. He will definitely come. Call to Wing Kee Warehouse for his Dad. Yes. We all know your Dad. Every time when he bails you out... ...it's like stabbing him to the heart. I did the right thing this time. Don't think you know how to fight. Your Dad is better than you. But he seldom fights with people. He is getting old. But he can fight against several people. He caught four thieves last month. You should learn from your Dad. Hello? I'm calling from the Police Station. Your son John fought with others again. Please bail him out now. I won't come. He is not my son. I won't come. No! He is not my son. I won't come. He will. He will come. Hello? Mr. Sum... Dad, bail me out. You must come. Hold him. Dad... Why don't you come? Come...choose yet? Boss is coming. Boss. How about that guy John? He got laid with May without paying. He said he wouldn't do it. What did you do? Beat him up of course. Right... Where is he? Being detained. Boss. You think he will let our secret out? He dare not. We can't get the key without him. Do you know that? We can handle that old man. He will give us the key. Right... This man is tough. He will lock the key inside the safe. Even if you beat him to death... ...he won't tell you the number. John is our middle man. Yes. John, someone bail you out. Remember to attend to court. Where is my Dad? The one who bailed you out... ...is waiting for you outside. Yes. Where's my Dad? He didn't come. It's him who bail you out. John, don't panic. Just pay some fine and it's over. You bail me out? Let me take you to eat. But you should get changed first. You are not a child anymore. It's time to be on your own. You are scared of me? Who? Follow me then. Why not? Good. Let's go. Bill please. Yes. Full? Yes. What do you want from me? You should get to know the world. See how others lead a life... ...and compare it with yours. Fanny is your friend. My friend? Get in the car. Hi, John. Hi. Where do you want to go? Wherever. Let me drive. Okay. Not enough space. Put this hand here. This hand here. Foot here. This one steps on accelerator. You. Don't ask. Live on today. Who cares what tomorrow will be? Cheers. -Come again. -Okay Elaine. Mr. Sum. You are off from work. Have you seen John? I haven't seen him for clays. He... I thought he despises me of being poor ...and went to the butcher's place. No. He told me one clay... ...he understands you. But he can't forgive his Mom. He said that. Yes. He said you has bad temper... ...just because you has a tough life. He will make money to please you. Why didn't I bail him out? Mr. Sum, what did you say? Nothing. Elaine, if you see him... ...tell him to come. Yes. You still remember me? Yes. I will do as told. You have been spending Fanny's money. It's not good. Take the money. Tell you what. Big Sean, Pipe and Hand... ...are all my men. Why do you have an eye... ...on my Dad's warehouse? If your Dad wasn't the watcher... ...we will not ask you... ...with good life in return. Don't worry. Your Dad will be unaffected. You don't know him. If people steal from his warehouse... ...he will risk his life. You can think of a way. Ask your Dad to take leaves. The warehouse will find a substitute. Just spend a day with him. We only need the number of the safe. You and your Dad... ...will definitely be okay. Okay. I'll try. Don't just try. It must work. We have spent some money. YOU are now our money tree. Fanny will still be yours. Who is it? Come out. It's me. John. I went to the Police Station that clay. But you were bailed out. Never mind. These things were given by a man. He is called Lam. We knew each other in a gym. He has lots of business. I work for him now. I get over $600 a month I really do. Be careful. I believe you. Go to sleep, Dad. I will patrol for you. No. I have just checked around. I was advanced a half month's pay. Find a substitute and relax for 2 days. John, you should spend time with Elaine. What fun do you have with me? You are my Dad. I beat you up often. You are my Dad after all. Go home and sleep. I stay here with you. Okay. Get up. Boss. I got it. I saw it with my own eyes. Good. My Dad has found a substitute. He'll take leave the day after tomorrow. I will go out with him. Go ahead. Find Fanny now. Boss, he... I know what to do. What a cool car... The car is so cool... It's gorgeous... Let's go, Dad. You don't have to wear uniform. I won't go. You find Elaine. Take her with you. You... The substitute falls ill. I've to work. You can't. I have arranged everything. You must come with me. Next time. You can't go. You can't go to work. John. What's going on? Please, Dad. Let's go to the movie. No. If you can't find Elaine... ...you can just watch it alone. Don't go. Ridiculous. Dad. Where is Big Sean? I don't know. Tell me. I really don't know. Let me go. Say it! I don't know. We don't know... Where are they? Tell me. Where are they? Fanny, where is Lam? You should know very well... ...they have business to tend to. Why come here? They haven't started yet. Tell me where they are. Fanny, tell me. Keep your shirt on. What is the matter? My Dad... ...has gone to the warehouse. Same difference. It's his misfortune. I don't care about others. My Dad is on duty tonight. I have to stop them. If you don't tell, I'll call the police. You want to betray us? Don't push me. Okay. It's hard to know a person. They are at Shun Yi Lumberyard. You will still be in time. Thank you, Fanny. All here? Yes, Boss. Boss... Boss... What is it? You can't do it tonight. The substitute falls ill. My Dad has to work. I don't care who is on duty. We have made the deal. You can't hurt my Dad. Go! Go. Come on. Get him. Get him. Go to the warehouse. OK...Go! This is Hong Kong Radio ll... Please check the clock... When the bell is alarmed... The time is 10:00. And now Choi Mo Po reports the news... Hey... How do you know the number? Your son told us. John... Come on. Move it. Good. Be careful. It's been clays. You still haven't told us the truth. You must know the robbers. They killed Mr. Sum. He was beaten up to death. No one will harm their fathers. No one will harm their fathers... ...without regret. Do you have consciousness? Was Lam the leader? He bailed you out before. Tell me if you know. Say it. Come on. Say it. Come on. Say it. Tell us. Tell us now. Quick. Tell us now. Say it, John. Tell the truth. Come on. Tell us now. Say it. Come on. Please... Say it. Come on... Get out, all of you! Okay. We will leave you alone. Let him think about it. He will understand. Let's go. Go. Get in. Quick. That way... There he is. Where is John? I don't know. Where does your boss live? Say it. The robbers killed the watcher. You committed murder. Tell us! Boss. What's matter? If he told us sooner... ...he could have been saved.
