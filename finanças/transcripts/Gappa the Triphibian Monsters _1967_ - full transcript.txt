Ms. Koyanagi, we'll be at the Catherine Islands tomorrow. Really? I'm so relieved. If I had to stay on board any longer, I'd go crazy. The publisher's idea is fine, but it's like being exiled. Mr. Kurosaki, we've received a telegram from the publisher. All right. I suppose he's going to tell the newspapers now. Playmate, Inc. I call this Playmate Land, a paradise in the South Seas. It's to be opened on the fifth anniversary of Playmate, Inc. Here will be hot springs for alligators... ...and here rare tropical birds will wander freely through the park. But where will you get those animals from? Well, I've sent my people with scientists from Toto University... ...on a research expedition to the South Seas. Sounds great. Wonderful. That's marvelous. But, the main attraction will be... ...the South Seas beauties they bring back. This will be an outdoor restaurant. Customers will enjoy tropical dishes served by tropical hostesses... ...not to mention the native dancing from the islands. First a successful publishing tycoon... ...now you'll be successful in the tourism business as well. How do you like that! People can enjoy a South Seas trip in Playmate Land without leaving Japan. Right here! All right here! Tomorrow we arrive at our South Sea paradise. Ha! Maybe for you, but we have work to do. I envy you. Your company's paying for this trip... ...and our boss is paying for your research too. Yeah, but we're here for scientific research. At our company's expense! Mr. Kurosaki... What's that? It's coming! Professor... An underwater earthquake... and close! Bring her about! It's over now, are you okay? I'm all right. Had we been on deck, we'd have been thrown into the sea. Saburo was out on deck! What? Kurosaki! What's wrong? Like this! Big eyes! A great big monster! A monster? I caught it. Its tail was bigger than this ship! Don't be stupid! There's no fish like that. It's true! Come and see for yourself I Where is it? Over here! Take a look! What's going on? There's nothing there. Stop getting everyone so excited. But I was sure... It's still hooked! Now everyone, step back. All right. I have you now! I knew it was nothing! It must've been hooked on the boat. Everything looks big to short-stuff! Mr. Kurosaki! Come with me. Professor, come here! That's Obelisk island. Its volcano is still active. That earthquake... Caused by that volcano. Let's start with that island. What is that? Looks just like the statues on Easter Island. But we're thousands of miles away from Easter Island. There's a theory that all these islands were once connected... ...and some parts sank into the sea. So that statue isn't so strange. What kind of stone statue is it? Just an idol... The remains of a lost civilization. This is getting interesting! Maybe we can go treasure hunting. Seven of us will be going ashore. If you run into any trouble, return to the ship at once. We'll be all right. Now, let's go. Let's go. I'm sure I've been here before. What's that? I'm sure of it. Doesn't this look like the Playmate Land model? That's it! I saw it in the office. Cannibals! Are you Japan people? We're Japanese... How did you know? Lieutenant... which one? Lieutenant? I am. Japanese people make promise to come back. After many moons you come back. Gappa no angry now. Gappa? No angry. We are happy. What does Gappa mean? May be their god. They think we can stop earthquakes. Speaking of which, the earthquakes have stopped. Boy, where's the large stone idol? Large... Stone idol. Gappa! So that's Gappa. Let's go find this Gappa. Lieutenant here now. Gappa sleep. We don't have that kind of power. We can't tell when it'll happen again. Why don't we take them back to Japan? Japan? Playmate Land won't make sense to you. There's a place being built in Japan where you can you live. My people born here. We die here. But you'll be in danger if you don't leave here. We came here for scientific research. We shouldn't interfere with these people. Where are they going? Don't you think it's strange? What is? Gappa's supposed to be their god, but everybody's afraid of him. In primitive races the most fearful thing is usually the God. No God... Gappa no God. Well... you can speak. Gappa... no God. Then what is it? Gappa... He fly. Have you seen Gappa? People tell me. I'm getting confused. Well, let's go find that stone idol. Mr. Kurosaki! Mr. Kurosaki! He should take me when he goes treasure hunting. I'll just go find my own treasure. That almost scared me. The same as the Idols on Easter Island! But what's it doing here? Let's look. No go! No go there! Why not? My people never go! In there you die! Don't worry. It's only a stone statue. No go! Gappa angry! Professor, Kurosaki must've gone into the jungle. Look at that! Let's go inside! But... No go! Gappa angry! Don't worry. Go get the lieutenant. Say your friend went into a cave. Mr. Kurosaki! Where did they go? I'm tired of treasure hunting. They must've gone in there. I'm scared. I don't like places like this. Don't be silly. You're supposed to be a news photographer. But... Then go back, marry an office worker... ...have babies and change diapers! All right! I'm not quitting! Incredible... A lake under a volcano. Are we still alive? Yes, we are. You see? Unbelievable... We're the first to see this lake. Suddenly you're a photographer again. Mr. Kurosaki... I'm not being sarcastic. Forgive me. A prehistoric skeleton... ...I'll bet this is what the natives call "Gappa". It must have been a terrible thing. That stone idol must've been placed there to seal up the cave. Mr. Kurosaki! You're mean! Going treasure hunting without me. Treasure hunting? Are you daydreaming again? Wrong again? This is no fun. What's that? A rock? Let's go there. It's an egg! I've never seen a chicken egg that big! But it looks like one. An earthquake! Let's get out of here. We'll all be killed! Mr. Kurosaki! Mr. Kurosaki! You shouldn't go off on your own. We were worried. Sorry. Tonoka... We found something very interesting. What? Come and take a look. Al right. Incredible... It's definitely an egg. Whatever was inside must be still here. Catch it! Wait. Just be careful. It's all right. Wait! No touch! Gappa angry! No touch! Gappa angry! You people come. Gappa now much angry. Please don't be upset. We're not the Gods of the earthquake. If you people go, Gappa be more angry. That's why you should come to Japan with us. These people will never leave this island. But if we leave them here... They'll be okay. This island has been here a long time. It's not going to sink. This no okay! Gappa angry! It's just a big lizard. You people take away. Gappa cast spell. He be much much angry. This, give back to Gappa. Shall we throw it back in the lake? In lake? I'll tell you what Gappa is... ...bones that lived millions of years ago. I'm worried... It won't eat anything. Pretty soon it'll become tame. It looks like a monster, but it's really cute. To have seen something actually hatched from a dinosaur egg... Amazing! The temperature in that cave must've remained stable for centuries. You think it's older than the Ice Age? An egg in hibernation could hatch, if the temperature went up. See... the mother lays an egg, and then dies by the side of that lake... ...a million years later, the egg hatches... makes a great story! Maybe it's a mistake to take this baby away from that island... Worrying about what the native said? Since it's so rare a species, people will keep bothering it from now on... You and I don't think alike. I want to use it for research on the evolution of reptiles. There must be many people who think differently than you. What does that mean? Our publisher will try to make money out of it. I sent a cable to the publisher. He'll sure be surprised. I can't find it. Sir, what's the height? Oh, about five feet. That small? You can't judge a man's value by his height. Understand? I was asking about Gappa's height. Idiot! Why didn't you say so? Thank you! Practice well. Yes! I've finished my dance lesson. Papa, are you finished? This is important work. Why don't you go play? It's no fun... always working, working. Alright, when I'm done, I'll do anything you want. Then... will you find me a Mom? Don't be silly. Your Mom's in heaven. I mean a new Mom! I wish my dance teacher would be my Mom! Don't talk nonsense. Go and play with your dolls. Excuse me for being so occupied... Well, did you find Gappa? I can't find any reptile like that. Then look harder! We have to have a good story to make reporters meet the ship. But this is everything... Something smells here! What? The cable they sent... maybe they all got sun stroke and... ...and all they have is a burnt lizard. What's that? That's possible! Just a burnt lizard. That's right. It must be that. Spending so much money over a stupid burnt lizard. Making a big deal out of it... And they're on the way home? Those idiots are trying to ruin my Playmate Land! What's going on in Obelisk? Hey! Can't you make it go faster? How dare you? Trying to make a fool out of me... ...with a crazy story of a burnt lizard. Those reporters are all waiting to see what you brought back. Strange animals, beautiful birds, exotic plants... What can I tell them? Tell them we failed. Then it's true! And you want me to apologize for you? You must be joking. This Gappa story will give you the biggest circulation in the world. Don't think you can fool me like that! Just wait until you see what we have. I've seen burnt lizards before. Just keep the story of the baby Gappa to yourselves for a while. That's impossible. We'll have to take it through customs. We'll take it ashore by motor boat and we'll hide it from those pesky reporters. This is the only one in the world. A real prehistoric reptile. We should tell the newspapers for scientific reasons. Perhaps you've forgotten who paid for this expedition? Well, I don't intend to keep it a secret forever. First, Playmate Magazine will run a full feature on it in the next issue. Then, we'll use the little beast as an opening attraction for Playmate Land... ...that's not too much to ask. Hiding this discovery so you can make a profit is all wrong to me. You don't want us to have exclusive possession? What? This is a great chance for you to become a famous scientist. Why you... You think of everything as a scientist, but I'M a reporter... ...You live for science, I live for news. Now tell me. If you don't want to keep it a secret without showing it to anyone, I won't stop you. If so, we all keep it a secret then ...I'll ship it back to the island. Playmate Land Opening Postponed New Business Venture Fails They'll turn green when they see our next issue. What do we do after that? We'll raise that baby Gappa ourselves. It'll be Playmate Land's main attraction. Won't that be dangerous? You can tame any animal... We'll teach it a few tricks; I'll leave that up to you two. This'll be the greatest business venture I've ever undertaken! A foot and a half in one week! How big will it get? Soon it'll be too big to keep here. We'd better take it to Playmate Land. No! I don't want them to have it. Neither do I. I want your research to be successful. Thank you. This is for you. Thanks! Mr. Tonoka... don't make her work too hard. She hasn't had enough sleep lately. I'm not keeping her. I'm helping because I want to. So that's it. This baby is quiet and moody... Look in the mirror. You're only 22 and getting wrinkles. It's none of your concern... I'm not your wife! Now, leave me alone! You're very straight forward. He doesn't have any affection for animals. He's only a reporter. Isn't that his work? Now, you're taking his side. It's just that he's doing his job, and I'm doing mine. We're in different positions. Look at this. See! It's big! Unbelievable! What's it mean? It can't be a reptile... these brain waves resemble a bird's... And that means... An extraordinary homing ability. And it can communicate with others of its own species. Then, if it's parents were still alive... ...they could find out where he is. What happened? It attacked Hosoda! That's not true! It's mine, and I can do what I want with it! It gives off sparks... like electricity! It really is a monster! Mr. Funatsu, you must leave here! To keep it secret, you have to stay away from here! Gappa's baby... they take to Japan. Gappa? Japan? Gappa's parents alive... Gappa's parents angry... spitting fire. Gappa! TOKYO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Flight 506 maintain altitude, wait for landing instructions. This is Flight 506. Roger. What's that? We're going to hit! Take us down! Attention two aircraft over Haneda. Identify yourselves immediately. I've never seen a plane built like that. Climbing at fantastic speed! Climbing? Almost vertically. But wasn't the ocean right below the plane? Yes. But I actually saw them flying at tremendous speed. No jet could overtake them. There were two of them? Yes, there are two. Which direction did they go? Toward Sagami Bay. Sagami Bay? The mysterious flying objects are allegedly heading towards Sagami Bay... Do you think Gappa's parents can fly? No. The wings wouldn't be developed enough. But even the impossible can happen. Maybe we did make a big mistake. What's that!? It's impossible to anticipate where the two monsters will attack next. The government has asked the Armed Forces and the U.S. military... ...to destroy this horrible menace. Hey, look at that! What's taking them so long? If those monsters aren't killed, what'|| happen to us? Isn't there any way to stop them? Still arguing? Bombing didn't hurt them, and neither did the poison liquid. Their heat rays are more powerful than anything we know. That must be weakening our weapons. If we could get them back on land and use missiles... Then kill 'em! But we have to get them out of the lake. There's one way... It can be done with sound waves! The Gappa are very sensitive to sound, more so than any animal. For instance... That is unpleasant to a human ear. You heard it at about 12,000 cycles, but 30,000 cycles in the water... Will it really work? It'll get the Gappa out of the lake. Saki! It's dangerous up there! Gappa! Go back to island with me! It's strange... I wonder why? There's some kind of link between that animal and human kindness. I wish I knew what it was. Everything is ready. Roger. Wait for orders. Are the missile troops ready for action? Troop 106... Ready. Very well! Mr. Tonoka doesn't care what happens to the baby Gappa. He's only interested in his own research. Every man has his own ambitions. We all want to be successful in our work. I'm the same as he is. That's why you should understand what he's doing. You love him, don't you? You think so? Am I wrong? In that cave on the island... ...there was just the two of us. I wanted to be with you all my life... Ms. Koyanagi... But... now I don't. I hate you and I hate Tonoka! It's all right, this is Dr. McDonald from America. I'm so glad you're all right. This boy told us what happened. Gappa look for baby. So come here. You must send baby back now. Then Gappa, no be angry. Me go back with Gappa. What? Gappa want baby very much... So Gappa angry... You promise send Gappa back! The parents of that baby Gappa have the same feelings as humans. I'm sure this boy's right and what we're doing is wrong. Send the baby back. You've got to do it right away. Can you guarantee those monsters will go away then? We've got to do all we can! Look... It's too late! We're ready! It worked... Get ready to fire! Gappa! Saki! Stop! Gappa! Gappa!I Gappa! Gappa!I They're getting weak. Keep firing! Contact headquarters. How's the Nikko area? No specific information, but it's bad. Atami and Kawaguchi were badly damaged. And even missiles can't stop them. We must protect Tokyo any way possible. Get the men in position. First division prepare to take positions... After attacking Nikko, the monsters have changed course... ...they're now headed south toward Tokyo on Route 11... ...all residents have been ordered to evacuate. Just listen to me once! You must return the baby Gappa. It's a big gamble, but you must believe this boy. We know nothing about these creatures, but this boy does! You're stupid! If we send it back, do you think the monsters will go away? There's no other way. Says who? After all our trouble, I won't send it back! The Gappa are coming closer. Soon, they'll destroy the whole country. There's something you're forgetting. If giving back the baby makes them go away... Not only I, but you too will be blamed for this disaster. I'll take the blame. Kurosaki! You'll be punished too. I brought it back. I'll take full responsibility. I don't care what you say, you can't take it back! Papa, give it back. Promise me. The baby misses his Mommy and Daddy. Bah! Those monsters don't have feelings. I don't like you anymore! Sir, you've changed... We can't listen to a madman. Let's get ready. The helicopters are coming. We're ready. Okay, let's go. The two monsters are now heading toward the industrial area... ...the airport is closed to all flights... ...there's no way of stopping them as they destroy everything... ...please stay tuned for further developments. Doctor, can't the helicopters go any faster? They can't. They're carrying a big load... It's no good! They can't hear the cries. Saburo, do you have your tapes? Right! The voice of the baby Gappa! This is it! They heard it!

Mr. Kurosaki, Mr. Tonoka, I'm sorry. I ruined both your ambitions. No, I guess we were being too selfish and forgot about what's important. It was a terrible price just to realize there's more to life than ambition. And Gappa taught us that. I've decided to quit my job. I guess I'm just an ordinary woman... ...should stay home, marry an office worker... ...and have babies. You see I... Well, Good-bye...
