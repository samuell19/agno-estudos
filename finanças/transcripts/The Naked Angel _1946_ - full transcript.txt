The Naked Angel The gentleman left over a week ago and, I repeat, we don't know where he went. Good day. Sir! I'm very sorry, sir, but in the passenger lists from our other agencies the name does not appear either. Thank you very much. No, sir, the person you're looking for isn't on the passenger lists of the last 3 ships to depart. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, that passenger flew last Wednesday to Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires. Tucuman Province, December 15, 1945. Dear friend, I am sorry to inform you that my inquiries have failed and I can affirm he is not in this province. I understand your disappointment, since this was your last hope. At your service... Paris? Grand Prize of the Salon des Independents Awarded to an Argentine Artist Your identification, please. I handed it in, at the door. Mr. Minister... Madame... gentlemen... No one asked me to give a speech, and I will not give a speech, but as president of the Society of Art Critics of France, I must congratulate the artist who created the Naked Angel, the latest Grand Prize of the Salon des Independents. Art can never reveal its ultimate secret. Give a man a mask, and he will speak the truth, said Wilde. Thanks to that mask, I think that only a marvellous virgin could communicate the truth of his drama as artist. Our guest managed to thus create his masterpiece at the inaccessible limits of beauty and death. That prodigious rendering of purity. To the immortal artist! Gaspar Las Heras... Argentine. Anything of interest there? Only this, sir. A note that appears to be in code. It will be worse for you if you refuse to speak. What does this say? Do you hear me? I need to know the meaning of this note! [illegible]... Signed, Actaeon. Chip. More? Thousand. Thousand. - Pass. - Pass. Thousand. Two. Two. One. Chip. Go ahead. Two thousand five hundred. No. I'm in. Show. Full house, kings. Four aces. What luck, Las Heras! Congratulations. - What do you have left? - 15,000 pesos. Las Heras beat you in the final minute. Time, gentlemen. 15.000 pesos. Made out to the bearer of the check? That will be fine. Whisky, Las Heras? No thanks, I need to go. It's gotten late. Here it is. I'll be pleased to offer you a rematch, Morales. - Good night, gentlemen. - Good night. He took the bait. Carreras, set up another session for tomorrow. Happy birthday! Am I the first to say it? Yes, it's the first time you've beaten father. You're turning 17, right? Well then, I'm down one to sixteen. Since your father adores you, I imagine he'll accept this minor defeat. - Who knows? Daddy's not a good loser. - Well, this time he'll have to accept it. Here, Elsa. It's beautiful! Thanks, Mario. It's good business. You never know what time it is. Now, when we make a date, you'll have no excuse for arriving late. Congratulations, Miss Elsa. Happy birthday. - Good day, Mario. - Good day, Eulalia. I'm preparing the lunch Mr. Gaspar ordered. It will be worthy of a princess! Excuse me. Eulalia, don't forget the 16 candles. Playing tricks, father? Mario knows my age. - How are you, Mario? - Well, sir, very well. They've promised me the professorship when I graduate? Mister Professor! I'm afraid to speak with you. He'll spend the whole day correcting me. - Father, you're incorrigible! - Thanks, my child, you understand me. Let's go. - You know whose it is? - I don't want to imagine. Imagine it without fear. It's yours. A gift from a poor father in love with the light in your eyes. Daddy! The words don't exist to thank you enough. - Mario, do you think they exist? - If they exist, they just melted. But a single tear of yours is worth more than all the words in the world. You dreamt about a new car since I sold the old Cadillac... and the dream just landed. That's it. A test drive! - Lorenzo, can you give the keys to Elsita? - With pleasure. Miss Elsa, may I offer you these flowers? Very happy birthday! - Thank you, Emilio, they're so beautiful! - Roses, your favorite. See you later, Emilio. - Here Lorenzo, a check for 15,000 pesos. - Thank you very much, sir. See you, my friend. Good morning, brother. Who was it? The man from Packard, bringing the car I bought for Elsita. A car? Gaspar, a man of your intelligence and age, throwing the house out the window! Feel free to criticize my intelligence, but not my age. One can adore his daughter at any age. Spoil her, rather. Elsa didn't even come up to give me a kiss, even on her birthday! Oh... in that case you should have kissed and congratulated her. Oh, how nice! An aunt, an older person, me, who stayed single so I could care for her! Elsita loves you, don't be grumpy. Father, the car is wonderful! What a great idea! - A great idea that costs a fortune! - Whoever said you don't pay for ideas? - Aunt Diana, how beautiful you look! - You've finally remembered to say hi. If you don't object, I'm going to imitate her. Good morning, Aunt. Cheeky boy! - She's allergic to caresses. - Gaspar is incorrigible. - Elsa already said that a while ago. - What? You dared reproach your father? The nicest man in the world? She didn't say it to reproach me, but to praise me. And it moved me so much that I'm going to top off the birthday gift with two tickets. Two tickets? Yes, one for you and the other for your aunt. I want you to spend the fall in Rio de Janeiro. Daddy! Really? It's marvelous! Right, Aunt? No, Mario? It would be perfect...as long as your father doesn't object to my going. And your classes? I don't have exams until the end of the year. I have plenty of time. Well then, I place these two ladies in your care. Let's celebrate! Father, my treasure! - Aunt! - Leave me be! Mr. Gaspar? - Mr. Vargas to see you. - Show him in. Let's go, kids. - Good day, Las Heras. - What's up, colleague? What a surprise to see you here at this hour! This way. Excuse me. Hello? Yes. Ah, how are you, Carreras? Tonight? Impossible. It's my daughter's birthday. Yes, call me tomorrow. I've proven I can resist the temptation of gambling. What's wrong? Your forehead announces a storm, Vargas. Fear keeps the vineyard intact, Las Heras. You've never had it. - That's how we're doing. - You just said I've never been afraid. Speak. We're broke. What? The stocks in Territorial... have crashed. Remember, I warned you. The consortium took advantage of the situation. - We lost it all? - Everything. There are no reserves capable of clearing our deficit. We can surely save something. You could get that money. I have no right to drag you down with me. No, Las Heras, we're partners in winning... and in losing. I've been crazy, Vargas. I'm not sorry for myself, believe me. I'm sorry for my daughter, poor Elsa... she doesn't deserve the least suffering. And for you, my dear friend. Ah, if only I could sell my soul to the devil! Not torture yourself for me, Las Heras, I'm a single man. I'll survive the storm. Think about it. We have to find a solution... and struggle. I have a feeling, Vargas, that everything will turn out well. I beg you to leave me alone now. Tomorrow we'll see each other. - Tonight I'll make a decision. - Think about it. A few moments ago I decided to send her to Rio. I will, I don't want her to witness this collapse. Knowing she's happy will make me stronger for the struggle. A great poet who never left his house said that to leave was to die a little. I disagree, to leave is to begin again. If someone dies, it's he who remains. If god doesn't allow him to completely die, so he can enjoy after death the supreme happiness of seeing a loved one again. The one who left, bringing his heart, and comes back to return it, florid and bearing fruit. What do you think about my father the philosopher? Like I always said, he's a great man. More than that, Mario, he's a great father. - May I play some music? - Everything you touch turns into music. Father, I'm going to get unbearable. Come, Mario. Excuse me, Aunt. She's an angel. You've stood here many times? Many... and most of those times, dreaming of you. Even before meeting you, thinking that some day I'd fall in love. That some day I'd be immensely happy, not because they loved me, but being able to love. So you won't leave completely, your father is right. Something of us always remains in places familiar to our hearts. You will be far away, and your soul will lean on this balustrade. Thank you, sir. How marvelous this would be if father were with us. Poor Gaspar, according to his letters he has an enormous amount of work. Later I'll show you the last one. He wrote such beautiful things. - Your father is a true poet. - A superior man. I'm not saying it because he's my brother, but you'll agree, Mario, that few are so fine, so selfless, as Gaspar. Elsa's mother adored him. You know what she called him? Saint Gaspar. - See you tomorrow, Elsita, sleep well. - Thanks, dear. Elsita, for the first time in my life I feel cowardly. Only in the name of that cowardice, in the tremendous terror of having a family name that is also yours, I ask of you a favor that humiliates and tears me apart in ways you can't imagine. I've done something crazy, I have to repay 50,000 pesos before the 15th. I hope this letter arrives in time. You must help me, dear, and soon, before it is of no use. In Rio lives Guillermo Lagos Renard, a very wealthy sculptor who I helped early in his career. I don't know his address. You need to see him and give him the letter included with this one, in which I ask him for that money that I promise to pay back with my life, if need be. I believe that within three months I'll be able to do so. Run, my child, and pardon your father who awaits your response in agony. Elsa! Elsa! What's wrong? Don't you feel well? Bad news? Yes, Aunt. This must have been a real catastrophe! Poor Gaspar! Why did we leave Buenos Aires, Aunt? Father is there alone and desperate! At least we can help him! We need to see that man as soon as possible! But why didn't he ask a bank? Or Vargas? He tried all the banks! I can see him now. They closed the door in his face. He also tried Vargas. Must have been useless. And you think we'll get that money? If this gentleman is not made of stone. Yes. What do you mean, if he's not made of stone? If he has a heart. If one has a heart he doesn't say no to a girl like you, who asks with tears for a favor for her father. Today is the 13th. - We only have 3 days. - Yes, Aunt. Thursday is the deadline to save father! Now you're talking, "save father," those are the right words. Do you know the sculptor? I think I saw him at home years ago. But I don't remember him well. I think father mentioned him at the dinner table. First thing tomorrow we'll go see him. It should be easy to find out where he lives. Don't mention this in front of Mario. He mustn't know about father. But what's wrong? Diana! This heart will not let me be. Also the new joy that the letter brings me. Should I call a doctor? No, dear, I'll be well soon. But, you really don't need anything? No, Elsita, I'll take my digitalis and lie down. - May I see Mr. Lagos Renard? - Come in, Miss. Actaeon. He's the hunter who surprised naked Diana. She turned him into a deer and he was devoured by his own dogs. Miss Elsa Las Heras, I never thought I would merit the happiness and the honor of seeing you in my house. Do you know me, Mr. Lagos Renard? More than you know, miss. I have the memory of a photoelectric cell. When I see a face, I never forget it. But even if I had a memory like a sieve, I would never forget seeing you. You're very kind, sir. Permit me. We've crossed paths several times recently, didn't you notice? Yes. Yes, sir, but I couldn't imagine that you and the famous sculptor were the same person. In reality I'm the savage. I met you years ago. Your mother was still alive. I saw them together at a Mischa Elman concert You were a child, but you already had those same thoughtful eyes. Your mother and I greeted each other from afar. Then I went to see you in your box. Your mother then spoke of me. Don't you remember? Oh, forgive me. I'm so vain that I think I'll be remembered by a girl in love. But sit, please. But...I do seem to remember. Don't strain yourself, Elsa. You don't remember me. I think I was correct in not greeting you earlier. It would have been very painful for me, were it not returned. But how impolite I am. I still haven't asked the reason for your visit. - You remember my father? - Gaspar Las Heras? The most envied man of my generation. He married the most beautiful woman in the country. Now he's father to the most beautiful little lady in the world. Your resemblance to your mother is marvelous. My father... It's been years since I've had the pleasure. How is he? That's why I've come to speak with you, sir. I was to come with my Aunt Diana, who you must know, since you know us so well. But she didn't feel well this morning. Were you afraid to come alone to a house populated by images, ghosts, stone monsters? No, sir, it's that... Yes, Elsa, don't deny it, but forget your fears. Horus protects you. The Egyptian god who ensures the sleep of virgins. Orpheus, who soothed the beasts with his miraculous music. And as if that were not enough, Jupiter, owner of the sky and lord of lightning, who never pardons. All very symbolic. I hope you don't regret having come alone. Unless you think I'm a reincarnation of Polyphemus, who did not fear the gods and who devoured his own kind. I don't consider myself capable of devouring you. Drink, Elsa. Drink to the happiness of this reunion. A naive happiness, like that described by an ancient man on foggy windows. Cheers. And now, since I'd rather not take up more of your time... Take all my time you want. Take it all and I'll thank you. Time robs and destroys us, why care for it? I confess, Elsa, that this solitude sometimes makes me shiver. That's when I most need a presence like yours. Oh, excuse me. You've come to speak to me and I'm exhausting you with my litanies. I'm listening. It's from my father. It seems your father fears his valor as a fighter will be mistaken for the obstinacy of a beggar. I don't understand, sir. One doesn't ask for 50,000 pesos just like that. One demands it. And from what I see he knows it's not he, but rather you, who can demand it. I still don't understand, Mr. Lagos Renard. Why should I lend such a sum to man without responsibility? Don't be angry, Elsa. I mean without economic responsibility. We're not friends. We shared a few drinks in our bohemian days. I had to struggle hard and alone to make a name for myself. Do you know what help he refers to in his letter? He recommended me to a minister, who humiliated me, asking if I had a degree that would allow me to teach at university. Me. An artist. Perhaps my father was unable to do anything else for you. Your father could have insisted I be better treated. He was rich, the beauty of his wife opened all doors. Hah, beauty. It's a key. I already see that you don't plan to help my father. Wait. Excuse my clumsiness. Those painful memories suddenly came back to me. While your father was living it up, with the arrogance of a tycoon, I lived pursued by hunger. I couldn't speak my love for a woman I adored. Come, Elsa. If I had been in another situation, I'd never have lost her. She was as beautiful as you. Elsa... are you crying? I don't want to think my story moved you. Think of your mother. In the happiness you shared. I think of you, of your name, which the fall of your father will drag through the mud. You see, it's not me who can prevent it. On the contrary, only you can prevent it. Me? By assuring me that I'm not throwing those 50,000 pesos into the sea. Many sleepless nights, many humiliations I've had to suffer to become a man who can ask that sum for a work made by his hands. Father will return that money to you. Your father needs it to cover an embezzlement. That kind of sum is difficult for him to put together, from what I see, if he has to send you to ask for it. Sir! You're suffering, Elsa, and suffering makes you more beautiful. It makes you more desirable. I'm not a checkbook, Elsa. I'm a man whose soul needs to be caressed by an unknown wind. A man who had to pay for everything in life. Models for sale. Women for sale. Friends for sale. All for cash, rabid cash. The objective was never more just than in this case. I was a dreamer, and they turned me into a man full of mistrust. And worse, they taught me that one has to pay for everything he desires. What do you want from me? Why do you talk to me in that way? I mean that I'm willing to give you that sum but under one condition. Seeing you on the beach and feeling myself shaken by a fit of madness was one and the same thing. Since then I've thirsted for your presence, longing for it minute by minute. I desired you before I knew you, sensing it through the indelible image of that other woman, the one identical to you. No, don't go, I beg of you. I'll give you whatever you ask. You are the pure beauty I've yearned to love so many times. The image of love capable of making me relinquish my desire. I will not demand you be mine. The condition is this... You must let me contemplate your beauty. Contemplate it... fully. Don't take me for a madman, even if a shadow of madness shrouds my words. You ask me for 50,000 pesos and I'll give them to you, in exchange for your beauty, naked as water. My price is not excessive because in it is included your contempt. I swear to you...that I'll make no other use of the situation. That I'll not take a single step toward you. I'll contemplate you like a statue. The only one that my anxious hands will have not sculpted. The Condition is this... You must let me contemplate your beauty. Contemplate it fully. Contemplate it fully. Contemplate it fully. Contemplate it fully. Elsita! How did it go? What did he say? How did he receive you? He knew us. But who doesn't know your father? He's a marvelous man. So, did he promise the money? He imposes conditions... Conditions! Conditions! Of course, he's no idiot. He'll have a contract drawn up for my brother. They'll sign an agreement...and that's it, the man can stop worrying about his money. And your father has a document to remind him how much he owes. Did he demand a signature before giving the loan? No, aunt. You see, he's a complete gentleman. I can feel proud. Do you realize...father's salvation depends on me. On me, an insignificant girl. Aunt... don't you think that father could have taken a plane... to come ask for that money...himself? You father could have done many things, but without a doubt he's trapped in a net. - He could have killed himself. - Aunt! His fall will ruin his name, and that name is yours too. He's thought of you, your happiness, your engagement. Not of himself. I know him very well. Gaspar sacrifices all for others. Hello? Yes. One moment. Hello? Yes, Elsa Las Heras. From Buenos Aires? I'm listening. Hello. Yes. Father? How are you, daddy? I'm so happy you called. I was suffering so! I'm ashamed, Elsita. I've committed an unpardonable mistake. I've always been a bit wild, but now I'm paying dearly for it. Did you go see Lagos Renard? Yes. Did you give him the letter? What did he say? Did he say no? No, father. He said he'd let me know later. Sure, the sum seems to him... The sum, the sum! It's no trifle, that's why I turned to him. He's sold sculptures for more than 100,000 pesos. He's rich, with no wife, family or obligations! Pardon me, dear, I'm in a frenzy here. Let me know when he decides, and tell him I accept any conditions he demands. See you soon, little girl. I leave it all in our hands. And I promise it will be the last time I cause you such humiliation. Goodbye, dear. I can assure you I'll have the money in three days. I don't need to tell you, Las Heras, that that's as long as you get. I'll not accept any delay. And don't forget that in the meantime you'll be watched! You know my demands. It pains me to seem a scoundrel to your eyes, but life is a game and now its my turn to have the winning hand. Forget your scruples, Elsa. A woman of today laughs at principles and feelings. Shame is a mere ballast that should be thrown overboard. The letter says that the day after tomorrow is your father's deadline. We can still make it on time. If you answer my greeting when we next see each other I will understand that you accept. Come in. The man is waiting for you in the bar, miss. Thank you. I found out about this and called. I couldn't... We can't lose one minute, Elsita. Does father know you came to see me? He wouldn't have permitted it. Before coming I moved heaven and earth, - but I couldn't do anything. - Why did you come? I needed you to know the truth... the whole truth. When the collapse came, Las Heras, in order to not anguish you with the spectacle of his situation, sent you to Rio. He thought he could rebuild himself. We failed several times. Then, desperate, he did something crazy. Your father, Elsita, had a mortal passion. Gambling. Father? We're all victims of some weakness, child. Las Heras became unhinged... and fell into a trap. He lost the little he had left and what he didn't have. He signed checks without funds...and now... I must say it, Elsa... he's in the hands of those bastards. If he denounces them, he'll go to prison. If he doesn't pay them... Worse. You'll pardon me? I couldn't hide from you what was happening. I know from your father that you're in negotiations. Yes. I think... I'll get that money. I came with the intention of bringing you back. Perhaps I should speak to your father's friend. No! It's not necessary, Mr. Vargas. - Tomorrow I hope to bring you good news. - Very well. We should pardon Gaspar, knowing he asked you not out of greed, but to surround you with happiness. - Do you want us to call him? - No. I'd rather he not know you've told me all this. Okay, as you wish. - Goodbye. - I'll call you, Mr. Vargas. We're in luck, dear. The manager got us the seats. I'd almost rather not go to the theater. Father's call has me upset, aunt. You need distraction. Until you can send that money to your father, there's no need to worry. Assuming his request has been humiliating for you, shouldn't a daughter make a sacrifice for her father? A father like yours, since you came into the world, he has always thought only of you. You should be happy to show him your gratitude. You're going to save him. If that gentleman, in a way, promised the money, all you need to do is remind him. Or do you think he could change his mind? That man...is not one to change his mind. So, stop thinking about sad things. I'll get the tickets. Good night. How are you, aunt...I mean, Diana. Better, boy. Go get Elsa, we're off to the theater. Good evening, Elsita. Good night, dear. We've never been apart so many hours. - How are you? - Much better. The afternoon seemed eternal. I've never missed you so much. What do you see? - What do you see in me? - An angel. An angel? - In clothes? - No one sees angels with material eyes. It would seem that a golden haze enveloped them. You're a poet... - You don't see life. - I see you, who are more than life. Careful... - there are people. - And who cares? Seeing you they'll understand it's impossible to be at your side five minutes without kissing you. I'm not a checkbook, Elsa. I'm a man whose soul needs to be caressed by an unknown wind. You are the pure beauty I've yearned to love so many times, the image of love capable of making me relinquish my desire. I will not demand you be mine. The condition is this... You must let me contemplate your beauty. Contemplate it... fully. You know my demand. The letter says that the day after tomorrow is your father's deadline. We can still make it on time. If you answer my greeting when we next see each other I will understand that you accept. Tomorrow midnight at my house, and the check will not be cancelled. May Diana's trembling at the supreme affliction of her nakedness, illuminate my darkness like a light. Actaeon. Yes, yes, sir. - Who's calling? - From Buenos Aires. Has something happened to Gaspar? Please, aunt, don't torment me any more! Hello? Father? Daddy, how are you? What's happening? How are you, Elsa, my Elsa? Well, father. It's all arranged. It's all arranged. What did you say? I can hardly hear you! I have a check in your name, father! Mr. Lagos Renard... has kept his word. Thanks, Elsita. Thank you so much, dear. But that's not why I was calling you. I wanted to know... An idea...pardon me... I don't understand, father! - Yes, father, I'm listening. - Tell me what conditions he imposed. Do you hear? I'm asking you what conditions he imposed! What? Louder, please! None... What did you say? He trusts my word? Wait! Can you hear me? I want to know that he didn't impose any condition that's... humiliating. Understand? That's the truth? Did you go see him with Diana? - Yes, father. - What? Ah, you've taken a terrible weight off my soul. Thank you. You can't imagine the immense favor you've done for your father. One of those favors that cannot be paid back in a lifetime. Tell Lagos Renard I'll speak to him as soon as I arrange my things. And may god bless you, Elsita. Thank you. You don't need to thank me, father. You already know... there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Goodbye, daddy. Father? I wanted to tell you... - that I love you so much. - You see? No reason to worry! Tomorrow we'll thank that man for being so good. Please, aunt, let me rest now! Since when has doing your father a favor been a misfortune? See you tomorrow, aunt. Be nice. Elsita! - Tomorrow? - Yes. I'd like for us to go for a walk outside the city. Far away. Would you like to? See you tomorrow, my love. You see? Even the sea pushes you into my arms. Ah, when we go to heaven, I'll tell God, "Now you can go. I'll replace you in all your duties." "I have an angelical little wife, who wants no one to see her when we kiss, not even you, who had the goodness to invent us." Look how the water trembles. That's how I was trembling an instant ago. Only you bring me serenity, my love. Why do you cry like that? Because I love you so much, and I'm afraid. - Of loving me? - No. Of losing your kisses. Your tenderness. Life is so short. The sun comes out, we close our eyes for a second, and the sky is already heavy with darkness. That's why we have to love each other on earth, before it's too late. - Too late? - Time is short, my love. I feel like we're alone in the world. Hold me, Mario, tightly, as if they wanted to take me from you, and you defended me. Elsa... - my love... - Quiet! I'm yours, what else do you want? Yours in life and in death. Mario, my dear, don't forget it. Don't ever forget it. See you tomorrow, my love. We'll go to the beach again. Yes. I'll come by for you very early. I won't be able to close my eyes, thinking that the most adorable woman in the world is united with my life for ever. Until tomorrow, my love. Elsita! I was looking for you all day. I was going to call you tonight, Mr. Vargas. The check from Lagos Renard went out on the plane this morning. Thank god! There won't be any difficulty in cashing it? None. It seems like a miracle. Now I understand more than ever, why Gaspar has done so many crazy things for an angel like you. See you soon, Elsita, and god bless you. Thank you, Mr. Vargas. Tell father... I send him a big kiss. Elsita! Where have you been? I went out with Mario. But why didn't you tell me? I was crazy with worry all day. If your father finds out he won't forgive me. Did you see Mr. Lagos Renard to thank him? - Weren't we going together? - Tomorrow we'll go, aunt. I'm worn out, I'd like to lie down. You give orders, Elsa, you always give orders! I'm a useless old lady, a blathering old lady. Want me to shut up? I'll shut up. Want me to leave? I'll leave. Can I kiss you? What an idiot I am! I've spent the day full of horrible premonitions! You're so good, aunt. Forgive me the suffering I've caused you. You need to rest, Elsita. Don't be angry at me. I'm scatterbrained, but I love you! I love you so much! - There's no news from father? - No, dear. What a shame! It would be so marvelous to receive a telegram from daddy. He could say, for example, it's no longer necessary. - It's no longer necessary! - Elsita! But, thinking about it, now it wouldn't be so beautiful! Don't torture yourself, Elsita. It's time to go to bed and rest. The worst is already over. At midnight. Elsa! Elsa! Elsa! What do these lines mean? Do you hear me? I need to know what this note means! You refuse? Very well, it will be worse for you.
