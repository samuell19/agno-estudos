Take it or leave it. ♪ I will be the last to fall ♪ ♪ I won't shed a tear for them to see ♪ ♪ I won’t have your name to call ♪ ♪ I will be the last to fall ♪ May I? Again. Are you good? Are you okay? Yeah. You are most vulnerable when you let your emotions take control. Have peace in your mind first and let your body rest from your mental and emotional stress. No criminal records whatsoever. He is clean. He is in and out of the Philippines though. Where does he go? That's weird. There are no records of hotel stay. Maybe a different name. Or he has a friend here. Or a secret wife You know these foreigners, they have different agendas. Foreigners... I can dig deeper if you want. Do it. I'll send you more money later. Okay. I need a couple of hours. Here you go. Thanks. I thought we have a day off. - With Bashar... always the opposite. - Is that from yesterday? Yeah I never saw him like this. Yeah, he really never breaks unless it’s someone really close to him. Yeah, I always figured him out as a robot. Well he used to be in special forces. After so many years going around the world saving top officials, he became a one-man team protecting spies. So he was a spy protector. - Yeah you can say that. But then he became a spy. - And then? That's when he met Lily. Lily was killed a year later. She was used against him. He was devasted. So he retired. And here we are. I can see it all coming back. I never knew they were very close. Yeah, they're like brothers. Even before he becomes a chief. How did you end up working for him? Well... He needed someone to protect him And see through things before he gets there so... Naturally, he hired me. - Later on, you can be my eyes and ears too. - Dream on. This guy when in beast mode, can destroy a gang in days. Anyway, I need a rest. It will take him a week before he gets back to normal. - Do you want me to keep track of this guy for you? - Yeah sure. Good night. Okay. ♪ I will be the last to fall ♪ ♪ I won't shed a tear for them to see ♪ ♪ I won’t have your name to call ♪ ♪ I will be the last to fall ♪ Couldn't find anyone until I found some news this week in one of the bars where the police have no clue about the disappearance of a whole gang in a billiard cafe. Not even a CCTV footage. Can you imagine? Isn't that him? Yeah. - Who’s that girl? - She just started working there 2 weeks ago. Where is she now? She never worked there again after this incident. No records too. Need me to find her too? Nah, don't bother. - Setup the appointment with Han. - Got it. We attack tomorrow night. The answer comes from within You are who you are That will never change. Come let's go. Dinner is ready. Rise and shine bro. We got work to do. - What day is it? - Listen Check the phone calls made to Boyet during the market mission. I've already checked. - And? - There’s only one phone call. - Is that phone still active? - Yes. I've been tracking him since last night. That’s our guy. Send me his location. Sent. Also, I need you to put on your body cam. - Send in the assets there. - We used all the money. All of it? I know this is gonna come in handy Use all the money that we have. Bring up all the assets in the country. Okay we have to get closer to their location. Okay so much for one week. I think when you retire, you have little time to... See... Fuck - Okay, don't touch this please. - Okay. He is getting close. This is a good distance. Alright we are back online. - Which floor? - What do you mean? There's about 50 floors in this building. This map is outdated. Here it is still under construction. So? Which floor? I cannot tell you that. What do you mean you can't? I can’t see his location in 3D. We are not mission impossible. This is mission realistic. So we have CCTV but we don't have a face. I guess we have to wait. Hold on wait, I got an idea. Mica Find me the owner of this building. - Okay. - Thank you. The girl with him knows about you. I can take care of her. You don't want her to come after you... Do you? Just get this done. Of course Gentlemen Okay hear this. Mr. Han owns that building. He is also tied up with 2 other businessmen with cases in illegal sugar and rice imports to the country. So... Whoever wants the chief dead would be those 2 businessmen. So Han hired Mar. - Exactly. - That’s just an assumption. Only Han can confirm that himself. I'm sending you his picture now. Okay Marlon is moving. He is in basement parking. Copy that. Mar! Did you get his face? Nope. It's freaking dark. We need to bomb different parts of the city. Especially the power grid. That way, we can get my brother out easily. What about Bashar? One at a time Toto. One at a time. What if we strap the bomb to the chief as well? That is evil. That's a good idea. I like that. Okay I found Han. He is moving. You have to go to the other entrance. Hurry up! They are doubling their security. We have control of the cameras at the parking level. Good luck... Be advised. We just lost Marlon's signal. I'm taking Han down. Wait wait. Stop! 2 men approaching the door. Left tall, right short. Where is he now? 6th floor. They are coming down now. Take the 2nd elevator. Okay. Jam the radio. That's alright. Let him in. You'll never win against Marlon. Ha ha ha So you're the foreigner. You killed my men First I will kill your friends I think there's that young lady... I'm gonna taste her. Taste yourself. Oh fuck! Oh fuck he’s heavy. Key! Where are you? Key! Stop playing around. I know you can hear me! Wait! It's me. Geez you and your guns. To, I need something. Actually, screw that. I need someone. Boss? What!?! Hull! Hull! Hull! - Okay I need the address of his warehouse. - Sir he may be close to us. - Why? - This lot is registered to the Chief. And? It’s a remote area that has one cell site and serves only 1000 population. Just get to the point. This is recorded at the time of the inauguration. - This can be one of his hideouts - Perfect. Let’s go. That's him. Marlon Gulapas. 2nd most wanted on the list. His brother Sonny was arrested in Lanao, 2 weeks ago. He was taken to a secret prison only the Chief knows and me. Camp Bagong Diwa - Yeah how did you know? - He’s a spy remember? Little does he know that his brother passed away from cancer 2 days ago. And no one is talking about it. - If he knew... - It’s a massive riot. Who's heading the investigation now? Your bestfriend, Kris Santos. I need to speak with him. Oh he loves you... He hates you. - I need manpower. - We can do it. We have 10 minutes before they find this place. Ready the boat. Uh the Maritime Police is right next to our boat. What? I'm coming out. We're coming with you. - No one is here. Location secure. - Keep looking. They are here somewhere. Roger that. You're not gonna get away with this. Marlon Gulapas. Marlon Gulapas... I arrested his brother Sonny. Listen to me. - You arrested his brother in Lanao 2 weeks ago. - Yes. Sonny died from cancer 2 days ago. - Marlon was gathering money to treat his brother. - Where is this going? We believe that he killed the Chief to know the whereabouts of his brother. He cannot get in there... Unless... Not without the Chief. The Chief knows all the hidden doors into the prison. - The Chief is dead. - How sure are you? Do you have the forensic report? - We will have them by tomorrow. - What if the Chief is still alive? It's all in your hands now. - What’s your plan? - I need the Special Ops SWAT team. Roger that Wait. What's going on? The Special Ops have been pulled to a mission. It looks like Marlon is plotting multiple bomb attacks in the city. It could be in this prison. - That is just a theory. - What if I was right? - How do you know that the Chief is still alive? - I don’t. Exactly. I have to go. If you go inside. I cannot get you out. Go home. I don't feel so good about this mission. Me neither. Focus guys, that's just a diversion. Focus. It's gonna get messy. What happened? Looks like a city-wide blackout. They took down the grid. I need to get in. Mica? Protect Key. Yes sir. - Radio check. - Loud and clear. If I don’t get back by midnight. Call the Police. Hi this is Kris from Camp Crame. Yes that's right. Do you have updates on the Chief’s lab results? Okay. Yes call me. Thanks bye. Open the main gate. Key, open the main gate. You killed my brother This time, you die for real. Hey Chief. Okay relax. Slowly... it hurts Let’s get you out of here first. Can you stand up? - Uh yes. - Okay, I’ll count 'til 3.1, 2, 3. - Key I need EVAC and EOD now. - Roger that. I'm going in. Be careful. Yes Could you repeat that again? Get the units back to the camp. Where is the location of the victim? Okay thanks bye. Hands in the air Don't move They got him. - How is he? - Bad. - What can I do? - Just stay away. Okay Chief This is gonna hurt. Hey! I need to get him up. Why are we here again? - To teach some kids a lesson. - Did you just bring me to one of your missions? Yup. - Welcome to the real world of street fights. - Oh nice. Screw you. Come. Come watch. You're up Guro. Is it safe? - Key. - I’m listening. - Call the Police. - Roger that. You promised me. Don't hurt him. Oh fuck! Your brother died. And that's just life. But your anger will not bring him back. Why the fuck do you care? A man with your skills can be useful. But more importantly, you have a family now. You have a little girl waiting for her father to come back. What do I have to do? For now just turn around. And face the consequences. And then later we'll see. What was that all about? You save a man, you save a family. You save a family, you save a society. It's a domino effect. Woah what happened to you? There's more to this world than sitting all day behind the computer, Key. Are you going to become a life coach now? I think I found our calling. - We’ll get him out in six months. - Roger that. Let's honor the men in uniform who risked their lives for our country. - To the men in uniform. - To the men in uniform. Kris... Kris was a totally different person outside of work. You should have known him. What's your next move? Rebuild Go after those men in uniform who abuse their power. Dig into the underground syndicate. Make them pay. Well... I better get going. What is this? Surveillance footage from Mr Han’s building to your hideout. No it's not. I’m kidding. It’s a footage wherein Mr. Han was about to fall in love with you. - Ah no... No way. - Yeah it is. Oh wait wait! I have a better angle on this. See that's why I don't like to wear body cams. Screw you Key! - Cheers! - Yeah! One... two... One... two... one... two... one... Are you sure we are not gonna get arrested this time? Positive. So you haven't told us about our next mission. There is no mission. It's time to go on vacation. I used some of my savings. Vietnam. Vietnam? Vietnam? We're going to Vietnam? Vietnam... Oh yeah... We will need the army.
