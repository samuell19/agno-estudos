Hi kid, how ya been? Rambo, it's Rambo Papa! Here. Hello Maria. - It's you, how marvelous to see you! Thanks. Hey, welcome back, badass. Good to know you're still alive. Wait just a moment. I'll be right With you. - Uh huh. What a surprise, come in. Thanks. Sit down. - Mama, now that Rambo's here, I don't have to go to school. - Oh no, you're going to school this very second, and you can see Rambo this evening, right? Yeah, right. - We must be going, see you in a bout an hour. - Luigino, what's round and red and rides a big mare. What? A lone orange. See you later. Well how bout this huh. Here. - Where the hell have you been the last six months? I've been around. - Someone said you'd been in Marseilles. Did they? - You gonna stay here a bit, do you think? I don't know. You know the saying, I don't want to gather too much moss. Listen Rambo, a man like you could do big things in Milan nowadays. Playing sheriff with you? - Ah, you finally noticed what I'm wearing? Yeah you're a night watchman. Come on, don't kid around. Listen, listen Rambo, it's serious. It's an organized private police force. You know how fast crime's escalating. Robberies, killings, kidnappings. So now if anyone wants protection, they can hire us. It's good work, well paid and satisfying. Huh, isn't it a good idea. You and I'd make a great twosome. - I don't have flat enough feet for policemen. - Look the criminal element has got the city bottled up tight, they might just as easily kill you. - Yeah and a bus might knock me down. You know how it is, I try not to bother anyone in this life, in the hopes that no one will bother me. That's the philosophy I've always tried to stick to, it's worked pretty well up to now. Come on, gonna walk me down? Hmm. - Must've cost a fortune, it's beautiful isn't it? Hey Miguel come on! Hey only the best Rambo, huh? That's quite a piece of machinery. Look, I'm sorry about that suggestion of mine. The idea of you working with me. What do you mean you're sorry? I got a feeling I offended you. - You would never offend me with anything you suggest. Listen by the way, where is the headquarters of this police force of yours? In Via De Chesseliberate. - Uh huh, tomorrow I'll drop in just to take a look. Yeah do that. Ciao Flora. Ciao, I've eaten so much rice, my stomach feels like a patty field. What do you think might help it? I'll try a Fernet-Branca. Alright, double? Why not. So what's new in this wonderful, marvelous world? - Nothing exciting, yesterday I saw Rambo. Rambo, my god it came true then. What did? - Well I'll tell you, yesterday I was taking a snooze. You know, I was half awake, and there was Rambo on a big white horse riding across the horizon. Lilli, go and relieve Beliano. Are you Rambo, buddy of Scalia's right? Shake, Giampiero Marsili. Pleasure. - I've been hearing a lot about you from Scalia. Don't listen to him. HEY- Hey, get over here, come and watch your buddy performing. I saw. - Oh, come on Rambo, I wasn't doing anything. Get over here and I'll really show you a thing or two. - I suppose you want to give me a lesson right? Right, get you coat off. Clear the floor guys, okay, ready? No, I'm gonna fight my way okay? Alright let's go! No more Rammy. Okay, so you're better in karate, but I'll get you in the next one, don't worry. You got some other one? Yeah sure. Any more? Nope. That'll be enough. So you're better than me on the range too. But if you were a criminal, I'd win. I think I'd bet on Scalia. - A 90% probability that you wouldn't get away. Alright, prove it. Okay, I'm ready. Alright, go on shoot. No, no no, at me. At you? Yeah at me. Shoot me. You must be crazy. Try and kill me, come on, shoot. - For a minute I thought you were kidding. - No, not at the head, not at the head! _ Huh? Not at the head, go on take that vest off. - Not bad eh, it was my idea that we start wearing them. Marvel in the excitement of a gun battle, one shoots at the chest area, the biggest target. - But you didn't fall for that little trick did you, which makes you very smart. Listen, if you want, tomorrow you can come back here and sign on with us. - No thanks, I was just fooling around to keep this dummy happy. - He'll be here tomorrow morning, leave me to it. I'll fix it. No you won't. _ Giuseppe! Let go of me! No, help, let go, Papa, help! Jon-Pierre! This is Marsili, yes, Dr. Marsili, they've kidnapped my son! Yes, Sansiro, the villa at the end. - Look I know you don't consider the green stuff important, but for me it's an essential. The only reason I got involved in this work was because I wanted my son to have a decent life, better than mine anyway. Let's face it, the world's a tough place to grow up in these days. - Papa, if you get enough money will you buy me a motorcycle like that one of Rambo's? Well I mean, maybe a small one. We'll see, we'll see. Give me an orange Luigino. And now off to bed huh? Rambo. " Yeah? - You know how to find a pretty broad? No how do you find her? Delightful. Now off you go, go on. Goodnight. Goodnight. Listen this is serious Rambo, and there's good money in it. We could each make three million lira if we protect the factory and the trucks. And catch the bastards who are sabotaging it. Not bad huh? And if he doesn't get it cleaned up soon, he'll lose everything. So what? Let's do it! I mean, don't you want to help a buddy? Maria, you talk to him. Does uh, does this man have any idea who's against him? - Not really no, another industrialist I guess. When do the trucks go out again? Tomorrow. I think I know who pulled this kidnap. Yeah? - There's only one or two groups in Milan who could pull off a job like that. And the most probable is Franco Conti. Ah, he's just a purse snatcher. - While you were away Conti grew large gonads and edged in on the old Sicilian boss had here. Oh yeah, Paterno? Yeah. I know nearly all of Conti's special heavy's. With a bit of perseverance, and a big chunk of good luck, I think I can find out where they got that kid hidden, and bring him out. - You ought to be in a straight jacket, you're mad. Why do you say a thing like that? Well, uh, you're mad that's all. Why? - Well, maybe the father prefers to pay and hope they let the boy go. And besides you could be killed, those kidnappers don't play around you know. And if you did it, they'd still get you. - Get out of here, as soon as I found the hiding place I'd simply call the police and let them handle it. It would give me a hell of a lot of satisfaction Rambo. Pulling a bunch of Conti boys. - So you're not doing this job just for the money huh? Trying to be a hero, enjoy a little glory. Is there anything wrong with that? Well, I don't know. It's pretty risky work. - Maybe you're right, but I enjoy it. Rambo, it's risky yeah, but it's good fun as well. I'd much rather be taking a few risks and be happy in my work than sit in an office and die of boredom. Alright come on. You suppose they'll try anything? - I don't know, you hope so though don't you? Oh shit. Hey, am I wrong or did he already pass us? I don't recognize the car. Construction work. Hey, we're in a hurry. Hey, there's someone on our tail. - Don't be so simple, can't be one of them. Put that gun away. Fucking idiot don't you understand, put it down. He's passing, don't pull anything stupid. Had you fired, we'd be stopped for sure. - Yeah you were right, but the fuzz was really moving. - Hey, let's get out of here before this thing blows. Hold it, hands on your heads. There's four bullets left in this gun. Two apiece, equally divided. - The way some people drive is just criminal, isn't it? Look at that old gas burner. Well, they're all yours pal. How nice of you. Oh yeah, I meant to tell you, I wanted to tell you that you were really terrific, sensafionaL - You get your leg off that head of mine, you hear? Alright, on your feet, let's go, come on. - All this thieving, murder, kidnapping, rape, and mugging. Things were better in the war during the occupation. - By the way have you seen Scalia around? - No sorry, he hasn't been in for a couple of weeks. - If you do, tell him I'd like to talk to him. Alright. - Alright, gotta go now, keep this around will you? Sure. See you later. Ciao. Rambo, Rambo! Well hi. - Hi, now make me feel good by telling me you were looking for me. Alright I was looking for you. - And that you never once stopped thinking about lil' me during the past eight months. - I thought of you every second alright? - Well, if you insist on coming home with me, what can I say my dear. Here, come on. Hello? - Flora, it's Scalia, is Rambo there? - Yes, hang on, Rambo it's for you it's Scalia. Put some clothes on. Yeah? Hi, it's Pino. - Where have you been, I was looking all over for you. - Listen, I've done it Rambo, I've found out where they're holding the boy. The one who was kidnapped Monday. It was Conti's bunch who did it. It wasn't easy, I had to break a few heads, but I did it. Now listen, all the planning was done by Duval. Who's that? Philip Duval. Oh I know. - Look man, what about it, will you give me a hand? - No way, I don't want to be dead hero. Pino listen, give it to the police and let them handle it now. You must be crazy, no forget it. It's my big chance I'm not about to throw it away. Now listen, I'll see you in an hour at Pepe's Garage. Now don't flake out, huh, ciao. Hey now just a second. Now buddy, you've got a long way to Pepe's. Let's go, come on. - This is car 13 calling headquarters. Car 13 calling headquarters, do you read, over. I'm on that side road that runs parallel with the Via Aventinez, there's a body here. Looks like an accident, we called the CA. Pino! Pino! This wasn't an accident, it wasn't an accident he was killed. I know, and I know who did it. He was murdered alright, so he must've been on to a hot one. And he was the best I ever had. Would you mind giving these to his wife Rambo? I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again. Did you give any thought to accepting the job I originally offered you. No I didn't. - Well think about it will you? - First of all I've got to find someone. - Flat nail bullet has an explosive effect. You realize that's against the law? - So is kidnapping against the law, and murder. - Hey Rambo, how's life treating you? Pretty good. You know a man around called Duval? - No, but then I don't know everyone. - Well I'll see you tomorrow night, I gotta go. Yeah see ya. You think Duval will be in this evening? - Who Duval, I don't know I haven't seen him around in the past week or so. - Iron Handle has just won the San Marcos Stakes for three year olds at Anyono. He was the pre-race favorite at three to two. Which one's Duval? With the cigarette. - Tell me something, how'd you kill Scalia? With just one blow? Huh, or was it two or three? It wasn't me that killed Scalia. - I don't want to know that shit, man. It's my script and I know all the lines. Now you want me to start killing off characters, or are you gonna give me the dialogue as written? The Marsili kid, tell me where he's been hidden? - I don't know, I don't know anything. Didn't know your lines huh? Let go. - I'll think about it but not until you tell me where the kid's being held. I'll tell you. He's in a white house. Where? Not far from here. Where abouts? It's eight miles along the road, that leads to the lake at Vinoya. It's the only one there, you can't miss it. Bad luck kiddo. - That's right of course, tell him I will. And make the arrangements for the payment alright. And make them understand, I'll do anything to get the boy back. He's alright darling, but they want two billion lira. They refuse to bargain. Poor little Jon-Pierre. We'll need a week to raise an amount like that, that means another week he suffers at the hands of those bastards. Inspector? Yes, I heard everything Doctor. - Then you understand how it has to be handled. It's absolutely essential the police stay out of it 100%. My son could be killed if they interfere. - I understand, but when you do finally get your boy back, you'll have to cooperate Dr. Marsili. - I'll be glad to do anything, I assure you. - Then I'll see the police stay out of it until the ransom's in their hands and your boy is home. You'll keep me up to date though. You may just find you'll need us. Hello there. I want a word with the old man. - You say you want to talk to, the old man? Ah well, Paterno's alright. Oh, you wanna talk to Paterno. Uh huh. You're absolutely sure. - Yeah, well isn't this where he lives? - Yeah, only there are two Paterno's, he and his son. The old man, the father. You'll never guess who's here. Rambo. Him? After such a long time. - Well, can we put a bullet through his head? No, no, no, let him come in. Okay, no we're gonna talk to him! If you're carrying a gun I'd be happy to look after it for you. Right Franco? Right. Hm? Hmm. - What cheek, to come back to Milan and visit me. You haven't forgotten Hamburg yet? I shall never forget it. - Well it's obvious, Hamburg was bad luck for you. Why were you fighting me? - Did it ever occur to you that it was a situation, and not me personally? - You have no idea how often I ask myself that question. And never got an answer. Had I been sure of the contrary, I would have killed you long ago. Now, what about this kidnapped child and the two billion lira that I am to make out of it. - Like I said, you do the heavy work. Give me 10% for telling you where the kid's stashed. - I'm no kidnapper and you don't give a damn about money, or else you'd have plenty by now. I never have been able to figure out, what you got in your head. - Maybe if we ask him real nicely he'll tell us. Huh, oh thanks. Don't try it, I'm not kidding. Realize how improbable it is that you get out of here alive? - Hey Paterno, better tell the young man to stay cool. Or he'll suddenly find out he made a mistake. Cut it out. If he says it's true, it must be true. Now give me my gun. Give it back to him. Yeah. Alright, how about I show you the place? How do you know I'll do it? A simple matter of reasoning. You hate Conti right? You hate the man and what he's doing. He's trouble and you want to stay in control. And another thing, Conti needs money very badly. If you take the boy away, he'll be screwed. It's a pretty good chance for you to get him out of your hair forever. My son will go with you. I am old, I don't go out now. What caused that thing there? - An accident in Switzerland last year. Alright then. Rambo. Hm? - You should not have come back here. It won't be luck for either of us. You say that for me? For you, for me, I don't know, I just feel you should not have come back. Ah, well, sorry. So long Paterno, come on kid. Recognize any of them? Yeah. There Conti's boys alright, dressed up as factory workers. Well it's up to you, you plan it. And you mean 10% enough for you? Sure. - That's a good proposition, very fair. Right Franco. Right. - Papa wasn't too happy in the least about it. - He has his ideas, I have mine, right Franco? Right. So Papa's getting old huh? When you gonna hit the place, tomorrow? - Tomorrow yeah, so get lost, got it? - You're telephone ain't working today, right? No, it ain't working. - We heard you got a lot of cash on you today. Why don't you let us win a little of it? - Who gave you the idea, the younger Paterno? - He said to drink a couple of shots to your health. - Ah, I appreciate that, please go ahead. - Listen, just hand us over the cash. The what? - You heard wiseguy, the cash he gave you just now. Ah, Well. Yeah that's better. And this. - Leave him alone, this one's all mine. - Yeah stay out of the way, I'm all his. - Yeah you look real hygienic sitting there. You're next, come on. Friend, you won the consolation prize. For you're hospital bill. Here's your bottle Rambo. Thanks. Here, pass it around. Thanks. Hi there. I want to talk to the boss. - Oh yeah, and what do you want to talk about hair cuts? A business deal. What kind of deal? None of your business. You see, still I want to talk to your boss about. I can save him at least a million lira a month. You can tell me what the deal is, the boss ain't here right now. Oh he ain't here right now? That's a real pity isn't it. Yeah, I guess I should've realized the boss isn't around, it's pretty obvious, nobody's working. Tell me uh, the boss must pay you pretty poorly. ' Why do you say that? - Well I don't know, you all look so disagreeable. Oh well it doesn't matter. Oh, getting late, think I better go, solong. - You might as well wait, the boss won't be long now. - Alright then, I'll wait 1O minutes. - Hey, I get the impression we met each other awhile ago. - Yeah, last August on vacation it was. I met you in the Blue Grotto. Hell I ain't no pervert. We all have our little faults. - I don't really know but I'm not convinced. He's got a funny attitude. - I see, did he give you his name? - No, boss I think it's better you come and check the whole thing out. I'll be down in a minute. Alright. Are you the boss? Yes, and I'm a very busy man. I'm afraid I can only give you five minutes. That'll be enough. How about in my office. Please go ahead. In there, alright. - Tell all the men to stay on the alert, there's something wrong. I think he's probably just a ding-a-ling but you can't tell. - To begin with, the world is a very violent place. Everybody knows that, so what. What do you mean so what? So what, somehow you have to protect yourself right? Just like all the industrialists, that's why I'm here. To offer you armed protection. Protection racket huh? - Oh no you've got completely the wrong idea. I said protection, not protection racket. It's not that easy. You've gotta understand that I'm representing an organization that is completely legal. Lowest prices anywhere. I mean we could save you maybe a million a month. Thanks, I'm not interested, I've got nothing to protect here. Ah well, I beg to differ. I advise you to think it over. Many factories are very easy to sabotage. You know workers can be bought for nothing. And there's kidnapping, you or one of your children. You realize the industry it's becoming. There's a hell of a lot of money in it. - Well, kidnappers will be wise to leave us alone. It's up to you, but don't forget we'd insure you against all kinds of trouble. - He boss there's some kind of official van outside. Except for them. That's it Mr. Bastard Conti, run. - Francois, get out there and ask what the want. And act normally. There Paterno's boys! Here. - There were only supposed to be four of them. - Now there's nothing to be frightened of Jon-Pierre. You don't know me, but my name's Rambo, and I've come to get you out of here. I'll take you home alright. You'll soon be home with your Momma and Papa. Let's just get these ropes off you. Okay come on, let's go. - They're holding it, We're not getting ground. Let's get out of here. Stay right where you are. Now get away from the kid. You got five seconds, then I kill him. Walk over to me Jon-Pierre. Walk over here come on. Alright first the kid. - You better do what he says, I'll come back later. Don't worry huh. Rambo, I don't wanna go. - You have to Jon-Pierre, go on, go on. Get over here kid. Get in let's get out of here! That bastard security cop must've been working with somebody. What do we do with the bodies? We lose any men? Four, they lost three. Well what now boss? Right, what now? First problem, we've got to get the boy away from here. Then we'll worry about giving Paterno a little visit in return. They won't forget it in many years. Morning sir. Good morning inspector. Any news? No, nothing. My lawyer and I haven't left our telephones for a second. The deal's been set, it seemed alright. I got the cash at the bank. Do you think anything could go wrong? - No, don't worry, your son's much too precious to them. - They might just kill him anyway when they get the money. Did you come here for a reason? - Yeah, I want you to look at a photo, do you know this man? - I told you I couldn't do any identifying. A quick glimpse of a man getting into a BMW. Who is he? An old racketeer, Philip Duval. We found his body late yesterday in an apartment near the river. It might be a lead to follow. He's the kind that would go in for kidnapping. You promised to stay out of it! No investigations that would hurt my son. And I think the commissioner would agree. Thank you Rambo. Without your help we'd be starving, you realize that? But this is too much. - Don't worry about it Maria, just think about it as if Pino had given it to me to look after. Why was he killed Rambo? Because, because he was trying to catch a bunch of criminals on his own. Was he a brave man? - Sure, and he was on the ball as well. That's something I never want you to forget. So don't. Huh? I won't. Now listen Maria, if you need me, leave a message at the bar, I go by everyday alright? Ah, I almost forgot. I promised your father that I'd buy you a motorcycle, one like mine. Well, maybe a little smaller huh? You gotta be a good boy, understand? Ciao, ciao Maria. Ciao. Six, nine. - No, no, no explain it to me please, I don't understand. Well it's a very simple system. Alright everybody, anyone who tries anything collects a bullet. Get out of here, go on. Come on get over there! Go on! - Go on, go on, go on get over there! On that side! And you, you run along and report to that son of a bitch your boss. Go on, get moving! If any of you decide you want to come here again, you'll find the stakes a hell of a lot higher than they were tonight! - You must have guts an go ahead with it. All things considered. We've been through more trouble than Conti. Now the son of a bitch thinks he's stronger than we are. An impression that must be quickly corrected before his ambition drives him mad. Very difficult to talk to, crazy people. He must get it in his head that we are running gambling houses for profits not losses. And this time, I will take care of the details myself. My plan to get Conti was perfect. If it failed it was because Rambo went and blew the whistle. - No, no otherwise Conti would have been there waiting, ready to shoot. What now? - Well we'll have to kill Rambo before he spoils things. But first, Conti. Always handle your enemies, one by one. Get out, out! What do you want? What are you gonna do to me? Nothing, right Franco? Right. Come on, that's it. Over here. Here it is. " No! No please. No. You've really stirred up the shit. You satisfied now? No not yet. I'll have to bug you for another few days. You bug me? You're kidding. You're making me into a real life heroin, I love it. And besides. You'll always be in debt to me for being the only one to help you when you were in danger. - What do you want, a tearful thanks? No, you might send me a postcard when you run off over the horizon. - Why do you think I'll run off again? Because I know you Rambo. Well, where do you think I'll go? I don't know, anywhere. All you care about is to keep moving, it's just the way you are darling. Yep, guess so. - This struggle is going to be hell for both of us Conti, be sensible, we've got to live in peace. You can talk to my son just as though you were talking to me. Yes, yes I know, I know, we started it. But you'd better agree to a truce. A man named Rambo you say, yes I know. That's the first thing we must settle. We'll do it together like pals. Make the arrangements with my son, goodbye. Are you happy? Yeah, well it was high time. - What do you mean high time, I make all the decisions here, when and as I wish. I don't need your help. I'll do it myself. Is that right? If I were in your position I wouldn't say that. Who are you? What do you want? Well answer me? - Come here beautiful. - What do you want? Let me go, get out of here. He's not here. - I think she'll tell us exactly where to find him. No, look I don't know. What's this coy act? You strip off in front of a big audience for 10 thousand lira and you act shy with us, I think you're putting me on Flora. Right Franco? Right. Where's Rambo? I don't know. I said where is he? I tell you I don't know. - You're lying, you know where he is! " Ow! Damn it, you want to talk lady if I have to tear you into pieces. I don't know. You're lying. I'm not lying. We'll see about that! Come on sweetheart, make it easy on yourself. Tell us, come on! No more lying now, where is he? I don't know. - You're still lying, now where's Rambo gone huh? Come on, we don't want to hurt ya. Where is the bastard! - It's my turn again, listen sweetheart, we're only just beginning. Leave me alone. Hey boss, you killed her. Good god. You seen Flora? - No, your buddy's wife called though, Maria wants to see you. Ah, when did she call? About half an hour ago. Hello, hello? - Maria this is Rambo, got your message. I need your help Rambo. Something's happened to Luigino. What do you mean Maria? He's disappeared! He went to school as usual today, and he didn't come back, I don't know what to do. I looked in all the places he plays, and none of his friends know anything. - Well I'm sure nothing serious has happened. He's a smart kid. Oh Rambo, I hope you're right. - Sure I am, I'm dead right, anyway I'll see you in a while. Hold it right there. - Don't forget huh, you've been out and he was dead when you returned. Hey come on let's go! _ Boo! Hmm? _ Hmm? The idea was Pino's. I could do with a drink. Oh, take care it's still hot, here. Keep it as a good luck charm. I'm sorry Rambo. I'm afraid it was over a barrel, it was a matter of either you or Luigino. He would have been killed. I realize that. Yes but it was wrong. Wrong to set you up, you could have been killed. - If I'd have been in your place Maria, I would have done exactly the same thing to save my son's life. Alright? The thing that's really wrong, is what's happened to Pino. Thanks. - We got him, Rambo's as dead as a doornail. Good, good. I was afraid he might get you. - Worried about me, not about yourself though. I don't give a damn about me. - Who was this Rambo, they talk about him as if he was a legend. As if he were a local folk hero. But when it comes right down to it a bullet killed him as quick as anybody else. That's right, his luck ran out. - I'll create a real legend, with big money kidnappings. I've got an idea. We'll have the Marsili boy do another tape and send it to his father. And we'll up the ransom to two and a half billion. I won't break the rich slob. - I'm alright, I'm not hurt or anything. But sometimes I get very frightened. I've been here so long Papa. Please make them send me home. Please don't leave me here to long, please. Oh god what are we gonna do Marco? I'm going out of my mind, I can't take anymore. - Easy now, calm down, it won't help to have hysterics. Marsili. How much? And how do I know you won't do this again? Just a moment I. Yes, very well, yeah sure. They've raised the ransom by half a billion. How could they? They made the deal already. They'd given their word how could they put the price up just like that? - Because they know that we have no choice. What else did they say? - That we'll be given the system of payment in the next day or so. And I should get the money ready. Hey how are you Bev? Rambo. Yeah? They murdered Flora. Yesterday afternoon. Let me know how it happened. They broke into her place and then they just beat her to death. Those guys ain't playing around Rambo, if you've got any sense you'll get the hell out of Milan, HOW. You're a damn fool. And so am I, you know you can count on me. - I'll be a couple hours at the most alright? Wait for me here. - Right boss. Business is business, get that through your pretty head. - I know, but I'm sick and tired of sitting around in this apartment like a princess. - Well it won't be for much longer, so just take it easy will ya? How much longer? Maybe only tonight, if everything goes the way it should, I'll have this deal closed by the morning. And in that case princess, tomorrow we'll be on our way to the coast of Silla and a fun couple of months. Oh darling. Alright. Conti. Conti. Who is it? - It's your guilty conscience. But you were, there was no way you could. - I want the boy released now, call off your men. But the money hasn't been paid. - You'll have to pretend you've collected it. You're the boss, you can work it. You won't get away with it. - Listen Conti, life is just one hole. You start from a hole, you feed yourself through a hole, you shit from a hole, you finish up in a hole. And the one in this barrel can put you into that last hole. - I don't believe you'd pull that trigger. - The chamber's loaded with dum dums. If I put one in your brain, they'll have to repaper the walls. Call them. Where do you want the boy? 18 kilometers before Cernusco. - I suppose you'll give him back for peanuts, like the starving beggar you are. - Hm, could be your life that I'm a starving beggar. By god when I eat though, I make a pig of myself. It's Conti, I collected the cash. Let the kid go, 18 kilometers outside Cernusco. 30 minutes from now, get it? Yeah I know, I know, but the plans changed. Just follow my orders. Hey lady, would you come here? I had nothing to do with it. - I'm sure you didn't, come here anyways. Take him to the toilet. Yes the toilet. Go on. Stand next to it. You too. Put the cuff through the pipe. Now your arm, go on lady. I pronounce you man and wife. Do something you idiot! Get lost you cheap harlot. Hmm. Well wasn't, hey look at that. Well if that's Rambo, then there's something wrong. Just somebody who looks like him. That's no lookalike, that's him! This way you idiots! In the bathroom Hey boss you okay? The key, it's in the toilet. Hey Mario, go see if the phone is still. You got it? Not yet. The telephone's still working. There you go boss. - They'll have let the boy go by now. The only thing we can do is go to the 18th kilometer. First I got to call Paterno. I can't figure out how we didn't kill Rambo. What's wrong. I don't know, but I get the idea he knows every single move we're gonna make. It's like he set is all up in advance. Be very careful. This is extremely risky, it must not come to a bad end. We're in up to our necks, we can't back out now whatever the risk. If we don't finish it soon, Rambo's gonna end up screwing us. And if he gets away with it we could find ourselves in prison, and that's not for me. Hamburg is where you blew it. You had the chance to rip out that son of a bitch and you didn't. - We're in a hurry, step on it will ya? Jon-Pierre, Jon-Pierre. There you are. Hey, take it easy, got to tweak your mustache now. There. - You said you'd come back, and you finally did. Now Jon-Pierre listen, I can't take you home yet. The game we're playing isn't over see, because, because the enemy's still after us. We have to ambush them. Like they do in films, understand. But don't worry, you'll be home tomorrow, let's go. You sit up front okay, there. Now then, hold on tight and don't be scared. Alright? - I'm not scared, now that you're here. Good. Here we go. - There's too much traffic to do anything, just keep this distance. Go on flag him! - No wait a minute, we might hit the boy by mistake, and then we'd forfeit everything. His father wouldn't pay out the ransom. - I see a couple of cars tailing us, not one. Watch the road, we'll be alright. Just a minute. What are we gonna do now? - This is where we're gonna make our last stand. Why did you come to this place? - Because we'll be able to put up a good fight here. - This is exciting, I hope I can help you out Rambo. - I don't see why not, but don't forget it's also dangerous. Lots of them, but only two of us. - Have you been to this place before? - Sure, I've been here many times, Jon-Pierre. It's one of my country mansions. Alright, let's prepare for action huh. Now, ah here we are. Now we'll even up the odds a little. Have a look at this. This will put a dent in their egos I bet, huh? Here come over here. Listen Jon-Pierre, I should let you rest now, I know you must be worn out because this won't be easy to do only I want your help and you'll be home in the morning. Really I'm not tired I can do it. Good boy, alright now listen. Now. One, two, three, four, five, six. 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67. 68, 69, 70. Come on Jon-Pierre, now. - Alright, come on you little bastard. No let g0! Let go of me, Rambo help! No, let go of me! Rambo, help Rambo! Let go of me, let go of me! Go, go! - We got to hide the boy again, some place safe. Step on it, the villa, the villa! Go on speed up can't ya? Cool it, ya hear? It's worth losing a couple of men for two and half billion, right Franco? Right. Shut up you, be good you hear? Franco, Franco, Franco! Rambo! HEY- He won't bother us anymore. Right Franco? You killed my son. Yes I did. - I feared it ever since you came back. - He didn't give me much choice I'm afraid. When did you realize? - The first moment I saw you last week. Before you, only my son knew. Soon they will all learn I'm blind and, I'll be just a sitting duck waiting here for somebody to kill me. That won't happen. Tomorrow you must go to Marseilles, Torigo, he'll take care of you. - Why are you interested in rescuing me? Well because, in all respects, you're a man. Stay down. Jon-Pierre, don't forget what you promised, not a word huh? - Rambo, let me tell my mother about it at least, I mean about you. - Not even your momma, I want it to be our secret. You won't have any trouble keeping it a secret will you? - You know I'd like to grow up like you Rambo. - Be yourself, that's all you gotta do, and you'll be fine. And never expect anyone else to be anything other than themselves, now you remember that? Yes, sir I will Rambo. Good. Here we go huh. Momma! Jon-Pierre! Momma! Oh, Momma. - Oh darling, we've been so worried about you. And now you're safe. Luigino! It's yours. Mine? It's fantastic Rambo! Here take 'em. You're leaving now? I'll be back don't worry. One day, you're a man now, don't forget that. Help your mother alright. Bye Rambo.
