Your Majesty. The trial of Michael Taylor. Is approaching its conclusion. Your Majesty's continuing personal interest .. In this extraordinary case. Has afforded me the utmost gratification. I hope to remain to the end. The silent observer. That if the verdict should prove a disappointment. To the expectations of Your Majesty's government. I will finish it later. Honourable Justices of this court. Gentlemen of the jury. Never in my experience has there been a crime of such unmitigated atrocity. As the one of which this prisoner .. is accused. Gentlemen of the jury. Our task today is an exceptional one. This case is without precedent. In the history of the law and the sea. Nothing like it has ever come before any human tribunal. Now, gentlemen. When ordinary land folk such as you and I .. Take passage on a ship at sea. They're as helpless as little children. Utterly dependent on the skill of the officers and crew. But this prisoner was an experienced seaman. Wise in all the ways of the sea. When he made himself responsible for the survivors of the William Brown. A score of the survivors present here in court have testified that he saved them. But he also saved himself. There were 18 other human beings on the William Brown who might now be alive. Where are they? Her husband. That child's father. That woman's only son. Where are they? They are not here to testify. Because they were destroyed wilfully and intentionally by the hand of this man. Eighteen human souls. Nineteen. If we include Lieutenant Tarryton. Whose violent death has been described here by his sister Margaret Tarryton. Keeping this in mind. We can understand why the prisoner has no word to say in his own defense. Even his wise and experienced counsel have been able only to weakly claim .. That he saved as many as he killed. Let's examine the record of the prisoner to support this claim to philanthropy. What is his profession? A slaver. When he sailed on the William Brown it was upon slave trade business. Do these facts present to you a philanthropist? A generous warm-hearted saver of human lives. They do not. They present him for what he is. An incredibly selfish, intolerably callous .. Mass murderer. He is not! He isn't a murderer. Your Honour, I was there. I saw it. Silence. The jury heard your testimony. Be still. I can't. I mustn't. He saved my life. He saved my mother's life. And he saved her life too. And mine. And mine too. It's murder to take a life. Even to save your life. Or yours. It was a God-like thing to do. Nobody but God has the right to do it. You can't save some by killing others. What would you have done in Taylor's place? Not what he did. - And suffer Blackstone's fate? I won't stand for this insolence. - Then sit down. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please. Officers. Bailiffs. Clear the courtroom. The unanimous verdict of the jury finds the prisoner. Guilty as charged. The prisoner will be removed to his cell until ten o'clock tomorrow morning. At which time the court will pronounce sentence. If it please the court. As an agent of Her Majesty the Queen of England. I beg you to permit me to make a statement concerning this case. Here are my credentials. This seems somewhat unusual. But if you have additional light to throw on this affair. I'm sure the court will be very pleased. Proceed, Mr Whitby. There are some facts in the prisoner's past which Her Majesty's government .. Feel should be brought to the court's attention before sentence is passed. It's true that Michael Taylor was involved in the African slave trade. He came to my government's attention when first captured aboard a slave ship. 'To die'. 'To sleep no more. And by a sleep'. 'To say we end the heartache of a thousand natural shocks ..' 'That the flesh is heir to'. 'It is a consummation devoutly to be wished'. 'To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream'. [ Snoring ] Nuggin. Nuggin. Same old nightmare, huh? Yep. I dreamt I fell into the water again. I was going down for the third time when you swum up and saved me. Thanks, Nuggin. Tell me something. Being you're so scared of the water what made you follow the sea for a living? To prove to myself that I wasn't afraid of the water. But I am. What have you been reading? The Tragedy of Hamlet. What's it about? It's about a man who couldn't make up his mind. And that's the tragedy. Can't make up his mind to what? He couldn't make up his mind whether to live or die. 'To be or not to be'. Just like those blacks down there below decks. Most of them cannot make up their minds whether they want to live or die. That's what you get for reading those books. It softens you up. The trouble with you is you're getting too sentimental. You're the one who's sentimental. - I am not. If you're not sentimental why wear your mother's wedding ring in your ear? That? That is only because .. Well. When I ran short of money .. [ Singing below decks ] That Granley must be laying it on them again. Yeah. I'll teach you to be quiet down there. Be quiet, you black bastards. Well. Looks like he got them shut up again. Powdah. Mr Taylor. They got Captain Granley down in the hold. He fell in and they got him. Get the nurse and get some ice. - Aye aye, sir. There you are. I'm done in. Powdah. You take charge of the ship. Taylor. You help him. And when you reach Savannah. Hand the ship's log and the papers over to .. Updike and Morgan. If the British sight you. Destroy them. Unless you get a chance .. To turn them over to .. Did you hear what he was trying to say? It sounded like a name. I didn't catch it. I suppose I should be sorry for Captain Granley but I'm not. If the blacks hadn't got him, one of the crew would. What is our course? Due west. I'd shift it to north by west. That would bring us up by Sekondi. Say, Nuggin. Don't you remember what they told us at Lagos? Come here. Look. Captain Granley has it written on the chart. There's an English patrol ship off Sekondi. Exactly. Did you ever study strategy, Powdah? I never studied nothing. Suppose you wanted to hide a tree. A tree? How could you hide a tree? - In a forest. But this patrol ship ain't in the woods. Maybe not. But .. How many times have you been chased by a policeman? More times than you can count. You would know it's much safer to follow a policeman than have him follow you. I never thought of that. What's your course? - Due west, sir. Bring her up north by west. - Aye aye, sir. If we sight the English patrol we can out-sail them. Sure. Sure we can. Nuggin. Do you ever think I'll have brains like you? Nuggin. My thumbs are slipping. I don't want to die in the water. I don't want to. - Shut up. But if my thumbs fall out of here I'll fall in the water. I can't stand it. - Enough. You, Mr Tarryton. What do you think? I think we're wasting time. Really? And your advice in the matter? - Drop them into the sea. Just as they did with their own human cargo before we boarded their ship. A horrid suggestion but unfortunately it might be frowned upon as murder. Murder? But they are common slavers. They were bound from the river of Gabon to Havana. Ships don't leave the gold coast with empty holds. I am not commending the law. I am upholding it. There was no tangible evidence of slaves so consequently .. The men must hang by their thumbs until we reach Liverpool. Cut us down. We'll talk. Have the gentlemen cut down, Mr Belton. - Aye aye, sir. We picked up Nuggin on the gold coast as we waited for camel train of slaves. Nuggin's ship foundered in the shallows of the Delawong. Our captain signed him with the crew. He is pretty green. He didn't know he'd signed up for a slave ship until he's aboard. Then it's too late. We're three days out to sea when them slaves start making trouble. Sucking blood. You know. We call it 'making sangaree'. So they take an oath to stick together. When the captain hears this he reaches for his whip. He goes down below and puts the nine-tails across their backs. So one of the slaves gets a shackle bolt and rams it through the captain's head. From ear to ear. So. That makes me captain, see. I don't like responsibility. So. Nuggin Taylor here. He gets the job. I see. And how many slaves did you throw overboard? None. That's a lie. Mr Tarryton. I want the truth of this, Taylor. I'm giving you the truth. I had 600 slaves aboard and they hadn't asked to be there. When night came I hugged the coast and allowed them to swim ashore. Alright. Why did you do that? Because I .. Because I can't see people die. That's funny. A slaver who does not like to see people die. Mr Tarryton. Surely you don't believe this trumped-up story? You don't question his ability to out-sail us, do you? No, sir. If he could out-sail us he wouldn't be here. He is here. So obviously he's telling the truth. Do you still doubt him? I am certain of one thing, sir. He's the original captain of the Blackbird. The captain of the Blackbird was Paul M Granley. Now I know he lies. Paul Granley is one of the richest men in the slave trade. He personally supervises a trading post. Yes. You seem to know the name pretty well. Anyone connected with the sea knows of Paul Granley. I don't. I've never heard of the man. The log and papers sir, for Blackbird. - Yes. Get them red-taped, sealed and delivered to the proper authorities when we land. Yes, sir. [ Singing ] An unusual procedure. An English officer bringing water to prisoners. But. I happen to have certain regrets about my actions this afternoon. Pay me. You are the luckiest fellow I ever knew. Now look here. I came down here to sort-of apologise. And I'm met by insolence. I don't like insolence. What do you like? You think you're being funny? You thought nothing of taking advantage of your position to insult us. Now you come to see us. Why? You would like to know if I was with Captain Paul M Granley when he died. Was he conscious? Did he betray anything before he passed away? England has a monopoly on your kind, Mr Tarryton. They're the sons of rich parents in America. Who also look upon the trafficking in human flesh as .. business. Sooner or later you will get caught. But it's not my business to catch you. A year on a slave ship would do you no harm. Get the stench of the slave deck in your nostrils. Rub shoulders with seamen who have scurvy and mouth-rot. You've never heard of ophthalmia. Captives of white men get it. They go blind. The floor of the ocean is paved with the bones of slaves. Now, Mister .. Tarryton offers his apology. Well. That's the second bet you've won. But there's a third. I bet you didn't know as many verses as I. That's a bad bet, my friend. Sweet Gurdy Garver. Yodi-odi-oh. Married a barber. Yodi-odi-oh. Sweet Gurdy Garver married a barber. But she'll be at the harbor. Yodi-odi-oh. She'll be at the harbor. Yodi-odi-oh. She'll be at the harbor. Yodi-odi-oh. The captain and mate of the Blackbird are to be held. Yes, sir. Upper crust. A fluffy dove. You got to pluck them kind. Stan. - Sis. Stanley. Margaret, the last time I saw you, you were beautiful. Now you are twice as much. - Silly. But observing. Alright, Hendry. Incidentally, hello. - Yes, sir. Hello to you, sir. Skip a do. Get along. According to my report the Blackbird was chased before. You are to be congratulated, Captain. He easily out-sailed every other patrol ship. He out-sailed me too. Until the next morning when she'd taken her own time to dump her slave cargo. Do you suggest by any chance that the Blackbird was thrown into your hands? Most of the crew were familiar. The first mate Powdah was a well-known slaver. This man Taylor. He is new to us. He's not new to the slave trade. Last year he was master of the schooner Bennington .. When she sailed from Boston with trade goods to West Africa. I remember her. She burned off Lobar. Lloyd's protested the insurance. And proved that when she burned she was about to take on a cargo of slaves. That should remove all doubt about his being a slaver. However. About two months later. A man answering Taylor's description was deck officer on the Esmerelda. When she ran ashore in broad daylight. Permitting over a thousand slaves to escape. Are you by any chance suggesting .. That Captain Taylor is waging a kind-of private war against the slave trade? You find that preposterous? I find it very mysterious. At any rate it is worth a little further investigation. I've been in many jails but this is the first time I was paid to get out of one. When that patrol ship took us I worried that you weren't as smart as I thought. Look how it's come out. Here we are. Same as if we'd taken that stinking cargo all the way to Savannah. You were certainly right about that strategy. They didn't expect us to tell the truth. So when we did they didn't believe it. Beware of the Greeks bearing gifts. What Greeks? At the siege of Troy, the Greeks left a big wooden horse outside the city. What for? - It's what the Trojans wanted. After they pulled the horse inside the gates .. The horse opened up and the Greek soldiers jumped out. And Troy fell. There you go. Getting sentimental again. I ain't interested in horses. But I could get excited about a 'horse's neck'. There you are. That will warm the cockles of your heart, sir. Better than bilge water, eh? - Yeah. Now, in chess .. When your opponent shoves up a pawn that looks like a present. It might be a mistake and then again it might be a trap. Is that all you can think about? Hey. Look at that one over there. The one with the honey-colored hair. Is that all you think about? Sure. I've been thinking about that all the time I was on the Blackbird. How can you talk about chess at a time like this? It's a wonderful game. Hiya. Hello. There's a gentleman upstairs who wants to see you. Already? I'll show you. Among other things, I'm thirsty. If you'll come over with me and my friend .. I think your friend has other plans. I wonder if she plays chess. Come in. My name is Woodley, Mr Taylor. Barton Woodley. British intelligence. Thank you very much Mr Woodley for getting me out of jail. Don't mention it. Sit down please. No thanks. Brandy? Cigar? - No thanks. Mr Taylor, you were a ship's officer on the Blackbird. Is that a question? - No. A fact. Mr Woodley, your manners are those of a gentleman. But your methods are the familiar ones of a policeman. The same the world over. Sorry. I shall try and change my methods. I suggest you come right to the point. It occurred to me when I heard .. Captain Martisel's story that the fate of the Blackbird was quite interesting. Someone on-board was either incredibly stupid or else desired her capture. You don't seem to me, a stupid man. I've studied you these last few minutes and I'm an excellent judge of character. Then you should know I am not a stool pigeon. I have no intention of helping you convict either me or my friend. Good day, Mr Woodley. Is that still your last word? What difference does it make? Jail today or jail tomorrow. I can't let this opportunity pass. It may never come again. Possibly I am mistaken. Yet no other man will do. Will you come with me? With or without them? Without. And by this door. Please. I assure you, Mr Taylor, you are the first slaver to ever stand in this room. On that map is plotted the course of every English patrol ship. Across this desk come reports of every slave ship picked up or sunk. And of every slaver hanged. Do I interest you? What interests me more is why you persist in regarding me as a .. As a Quaker or an abolitioner. I don't regard you as anything or care what you are. You're the only man in the world who can do what I want done. If you're a thief, traitor or scoundrel you would still be the only one. No harm in denying the thief or the scoundrel. Mr Taylor. I am about to destroy years of labor or to crown that labor with a success. A gamble involving not only my own career. But the Imperial policies of England. I am taking this risk. In the hope of dealing the slave trade a mortal blow. Do you recognise these? The log and the papers of the Blackbird. Which you so studiously neglected to destroy. Amongst them. Is a letter of instruction from Captain Granley to his associates in Savannah. In it he gives the secret routes to be followed by every one of his ships .. During the next three months. To you alone could Granley have handed over such a letter before he died. If you deliver it in Savannah .. - There may be an English patrol ship .. Lying in wait for every slaver that's sailed. Precisely. Does that interest you, Mr Taylor? Very much. Thank god I'm a stubborn man. And you too. Don't you fellows in this sort of work .. Have ways of altering documents like this? Yes. Because this letter lists only ships leaving Africa in the next three months. If you could fix it to cover the next six months. You could get a crack at every slaver the Granley controlled. Why don't you take a seat, Mr Taylor? Cigar? Who's there? Me. Let me in. Did you get the Blackbird's papers? No. Not even a look at them. They probably have them over at the Admiralty now. Reading them. Don't worry. There can't be anything in Granley's letters to implicate you. But me dear friend. We are partners. Your misfortune is mine. How soon could I sail for America? America? Yes. America. I think there is a packet sailing at dawn. Do you actually think they could arrest you? There are much more important things than that. Do you realize that with fortunes to be had .. We've wasted time running a threepenny tipster service. But even that's gone now. With Granley dead. Yes. But his business is still alive. Suppose I go to Savannah with the news of Granley's death? Don't you see I can get the connections before our competitors get wind of it? There would be a million in it. Is this ship tomorrow fast? - It's the William Brown. It's supposed to be the fastest passenger packet on the Atlantic. She is, huh? - Yeah. Then buy her tonight. - What? Buy her tonight. Keep it quiet. Arrange to have it delivered to me the moment I arrive on her in Philadelphia. She'll not only get me to Savannah first, but to the slave coast next. She'll get us that million alright. How would a million suit you, Mr Pecora? Very well. Get busy and arrange about the boat. I'll see you on the dock. Here is your ticket, sir. She sails at dawn. Did you propose to take your friend with you? Well. I would like to. Yes. I quite agree. His company would help brand you as a slaver. Naturally, until your work is finished you must be known as one. I understand. Godspeed. Thank you. Did you see what happened to my friend? Which one was he? The fellow sat over there with a dark-haired girl. Him? He went out with her. Where did he go? - I wouldn't know. He said he was looking for you. Where do you think he went? Now I remember. He wasn't looking for you. He was looking for a girl for you. I have to find him. When he returns, ask him to wait for me. I sail for America in the morning. America? - Yes. Has my friend been here? - Yes. Well, where is he now? - He went away again. You told him I sail to America? Yes. I told him. - What did he say? He says to tell you if you're going to America he's going to Peru. 35, 36, 37. 46, 47, 48. Can I have a piece of paper? - Yes. Certainly. Pencil? - Thanks. Will you give this to him when he comes back? Please. Alright. Alright. Put that away. Cards? Put them out. Thank you, sir. Hendry. Milady, Sir Walter Raleigh only offered his cape. This is my complete wardrobe. Sir. - I'm sorry. Please remove this thing. Sorry. I was trying to help you across the puddle. My shoe. Here. I can do it. The third door on the right is Mr Tarryton's cabin. Thank you. Margaret. Stanley. You mustn't do this. I don't know what you're talking about. - Hendry told me. I don't want you going to America. I don't want you to give up everything. Miss Tarryton. I am Pecora, your brother's friend. Mr Tarryton isn't motivated that way. He has a most important mission. I must hope the coachman didn't tell you of this in the presence of your guests. He told only me. Stanley, what is this? Why are you going to America? Mr Pecora just told you. My orders were to leave immediately. I didn't have time to explain to you. - Pardon me. I think it would be better if you told her alone. Goodnight, Miss Tarryton. Oh yes. My apologies, Miss Tarryton. But secret orders must be secretly given. Do you mind? Excuse me. You must take her to America with you. How the devil can I do that? - She must not leave this ship. She is a woman. She will talk. What about the coachman? - I'll take care of him. Pecora and Tarryton. Good luck, my boy. Sweet Suzy Sapple. Yodi-odi-oh. With cheeks like an apple. Yodi-odi-oh. Sweet Suzy Sapple with cheeks like an apple. So, you were hiding from me. Yodi-odi-oh. Pay me. I'm one up on you. Ah Nuggin. You know I don't like water. Whales. Whales. Not whales. Porpoises. Whales. Whales. Whales, Papa. The whole ocean is full of whales. Shush. [ Violin music ] It's Mama's music. Yes. Mama's. You know, you really shouldn't do that. Why don't you let the mud dry first? And then you can just brush it off. - You can? You suppose I've ruined it? No. But now it's better if you washed the dress. It's better for the silk. You're an expert, aren't you. I ought to be. I am a lady's maid. That is, I was. Maybe I should have told you before they put you in with me. On the contrary, it was sweet of you to let me come in at all. I'm awfully glad to have company. I was afraid I was going to be lonely. I'll be glad to clean the dress for you. If you'll change into another. I'm afraid I can't. I haven't another. I'll make the whole journey in this one. No. You don't have to do that. I've got some dresses. My mistress gave them to me. Maybe one of them might fit you. Of course, if you don't mind. - Mind? I would be terribly grateful. Is your mistress in this section of the ship? No. I am alone. Maybe I shouldn't have left a good position to run off to a strange land. I doubt I would have left England if it weren't for my daughter. You have a daughter? Not yet. But I'm going to have one someday, and when I do and she grows up. I don't want her to be a lady's maid. - She needn't be. You see, my grandmother was a lady's maid and then my mother got to be one. And then me. That's the way it is in England. Maybe it's alright for most people. Even for me. But not for my daughter. Do you think I'm a little bit barmy? - Not at all. I think you're very wise. She's pretty fast for such a big ship, isn't she? The fastest things in these waters, sir. Tell me. How would she compare in speed with .. With the English patrol ships? She'll carry triple the cargo we got now and show her heels to the best of them. Is that so? Yep. That's what it looks like to me. A rooster up there. Flapping his wings and screaming at the top of his lungs. Do you know what he's saying? Nope. He is crowing: 'Mister, I am freedom'. Do you know what I mean? Nope. Well, you're thick. Maybe I am thick. But that ain't a rooster. It's a flag. That's just a figure of speech. I mean it is .. it's loyalty. Something you got. Something to look up to. Look up to? What for? Did you ever march in a parade with the bugles blowing and the flags waving? Nope. You didn't, huh? Did you ever .. You know what a sunflower is, don't you? Sure. It grows in backyards. Ever notice .. The way it follows the sun? - Uhuh. Like that. Always looking up. That's loyalty. Loyal because .. The sun gives it a reason for living. It warms it up and makes it bigger. It does something to it inside. You know. Nope. And the way you're telling me, I ain't never going to know. You're getting sentimental again. Let's go below where I can get some grog and I'll get into this thing too. Come on. Upper crust. A fluffy dove. You ought to pluck them kind. Oh no. Not her. Well? Gentlemen, I'm in no mood for jesting today. Come on. Release that target. You heard him. Release the target. - I don't like the way he said it. Said it? I should have a way to say it? Come on. Vite, vite. Allons-y. Release it. I still don't like the way he says it. - He doesn't like the way you say it. Can't you tone it down a little? Add a 'please' or something like that? Imbeciles. - What's that? Anything. Fat men who try to sing tenor. Rude people who waste their lives sticking long needles into sacks. Enough. Perhaps, you do not realise who you're talking to. I have nicked people's ears for less than that. I am Gaston de Bastonet. The Gaston de Bastonet. An odd title my gentle-tempered friend. Title? What title? The. - The? The de Bastonet. Not .. Mister de Bastonet, nor Count nor Duke nor Marquis nor Sir de Bastonet. Just .. 'T'. 'H'. 'E'. - On guard. Don't forget to write, Mister 'The'. Sacr? bleu. Cochons. I am so sorry. I was doing a trick and the cards happened to slip out of my hands. Just a minute. Please. You're dragging half my deck with you. - I am so sorry. Did I ever tell you about the time I was a stowaway on a cargo of silk? How could you? I've never met you before. Look. It's you. You card. The second one I picked up off the floor. Sure I met you. Don't you remember? I saw you .. - On the boat you mean? Nope. In the sky. Sky? - A year or 2 years ago. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. What difference does it make? You know poetry? - Poetry? 'The dawn awoke like a troubled soul'. That had cried the night .. the night .. Well. Anyway, there you were. In the sky, you mean? - Yeah. Right out of heaven. And you were the sunshine. Just like that. There was no more trouble. No more tears. They call me Powdah. Does that suggest anything to you? - Yes. It does. You want to know my name. Let's sit down. Weren't you afraid fighting so many at one time? Me afraid? Ha. I had my sword. After all it was only ten of them. They came at me through the cane. Across the swamp. All with knives as long as my arm. And what did I do? You know what I did? I'll show you. I stood with my back up against an oak tree. And I threw the war-cry back in their teeth. Lady Danker. Yodi-odi-oh. She hung like an anchor. It's a little stuffy in here, don't you think? Let's go up on deck. Lady Danker married a banker. Now I can thank her. Yodi-odi-oh. Thank you. That's quite alright. I assure you. I'm quite capable of taking care of myself, thank you. Here. The sea is very simple when you get the hang of it. Now, you put one hand there. And the other hand here. Now you hang on. Now we have it. Can I help? I need no help, sir. For what I'm about to do. But in this case you do. Yes, ma'am. - Please. You'll be very thankful for what I will do for you. Look, this is Kalisagi. The Gambos make it. They make it from roots and bark and .. Herbs and all other stuff. - Sir. Go away. It's as potent as old .. Get out. But it will certainly stop that nausea. I am sorry. I don't want any. Please. One funny thing about this. It's liable to give you the hiccups. Gone? Why, yes. I beg your pardon. What the devil do you think you're .. Well. How are your thumbs? Better? - Much. And your conscience? - Quite undisturbed, thank you. I think the last time I saw you .. - We won't go into that now. Since it concerns my sister I don't see why not. Sister? Stanley, he was only trying to cure my sea .. Sea sickness. I think he did. Kalisagi. The natives make it. - Ah, rubbish. Look here, Taylor. I want no more nonsense from you. You're the type of man likely .. - Stanley, he only .. I don't care what was doing. I'm telling you what he is. He's a common slaver. Regardless of what my superior officers' opinion of him might be. Is he the man who .. - Yes. Who hung by the halyards by his thumbs. Look here, Taylor. I warn you that I don't want a man like you .. I said that I don't want a man like you .. You mean a man like you think I am. You're just as insulting out of that uniform as .. As in it. Who do you think I just seen up on the deck? So you know then. The fluffy dove that gave you the eye on the dock. She was with him. So you know that too? She is his sister. You'd better remember what you told me. About looking out for Greeks when they have horses to give to you. I don't know what your game is. It's all the same to me whatever it is. But if there's anything you want done. Listen. There's just one thing you can do for me. What is that? - Two things. Sit still and be still. It's alright if I twiddle my thumbs? [ Door knocks ] Come in. Pardon me, gentlemen. I have. Come to apologise again. I'm very sorry, Mr Taylor, for my quite unnecessary rudeness. I know we rub each other up wrong when we meet but see no reason we can't .. Have a new start and be friends. I like the idea of a new start. Since we both go to America I thought .. Perhaps I may be able to be of some service to you. You having just lost your ship. For instance, I have .. Some very connections in Savannah. So you are going to Savannah? Don't be stupid. You know perfectly well what I'm talking about. You were there when Granley died. That doesn't give you the opportunity to interfere with me. You understand? You speak very distinctly. Think it over. Take your time. What ails you, Nuggin? I ain't never seen you stand for anything like that before. Are you sick? Maybe it's something you ate? - It's not something I ate. It's something I promised. You and me. Come and dance. Come and dance with me. Mind if I use this? No. Help yourself. - Thanks. Say, what's that piece of poetry you rattled off to me once? Poetry? - Yeah. You know. 'The dawn awoke like ..' Oh that. - Yeah. That's it. What was the next line in it? 'The dawn awoke like a troubled soul. That had cried the night before'. 'And the song of love from the rising wind'. Why? What? I don't know. I was just thinking. Who is she? Nuggin, you ought to see her. In all my life. 'Dawn awoke like a troubled soul'. She thought it was beautiful. - Of course, you told her you stole it? You see, we talked about so many other things .. She thought it was so marvelous to be a merchant of the high seas. She is dark too. Just like me. He is a merchant of the high seas with plenty of ships. That carry cotton and copper. And so many other things that I forget. You didn't forget anything when you describe him to me. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Handsome. He has a ring in his ear. Doesn't it seem rather odd? A merchant with an earring? No. Not at all. Not when I tell you about him. It was his mother's wedding ring. He says when he gets married .. That is, if he ever .. Finds the right girl. Or something like that. Miss Margaret. I've never been so happy in all my life. It must be wonderful to be that happy. Why should you not believe what other people tell you? You have never even spoken to him. He's a slaver, Babsie. Miss Margaret. Suppose he isn't? You would never forgive yourself. Would you? 'Get back into the house, boy', said Pete. The one-eyed scout. 'There is danger in them yonder woods'. 'There is Mohawks all about'. 'They're armed and painted up for war'. 'They'll strike before the dawn'. 'Protect your wives and children, men'. 'Do duty. Carry on'. 'Startled deer on Damon's Peak'. 'Gazed wide-eyed at the fray. 'Saw'. 'Saw'. 'Saw'. Carnage. Carnage? Saw carnage rot. And heard Indians yell until the break of day. Is that right? Sure. That's right. Do you know all of it? Uhuh. I'll begin with the deer. The startled deer on Damon's Peak. Stared wide-eyed at the fray. He saw carnage rot and heard Indians yell until the break of day. The earth reached up to kiss the sun. Found peace in Shattock's glade. And of the Mohawks. There were none. For history had been made. Don't move. The moon is right behind your head. I want to thank you. Thank me for what? For what I said about the moon? No. I wanted to thank you for what you did for me. For what I did for you? What was it? Sea sickness. You were very nice to me. That's what I want to thank you for. So, thank you very much. Why hurry away? Please. I'd rather you didn't follow me. - Listen. This is serious. You need someone to look after you. - What is serious? Well .. this sea-sickness. Do you realize that millions of people get it? Then what happens? They get worse. Yes they do. It practically wrecks them. Would you mind telling me your name? You do, huh? Well, the people who know me don't get seasick. No, siree. I just give them Kalisagi and boom. It's all gone. Do you know where I get it? Right in the heart of darkest Africa. Know how I get it? I fight and struggle and tear my way through dense forests. Please, I would rather you .. - Not until I'm finished. I am a man of few words. - You certainly don't talk like it. I came out on deck to thank you for being nice to me. You're just spoiling everything. You're acting like a child. How old? I am sorry. I am sorry if I offended you at any time. I didn't mean to. My name is Michael. Mine is Margaret. It's a lovely evening, isn't it. Is it? Beautiful. I would have to confess to you because it's the only honest thing to do. You've told me about yourself. Who you were and what you did. A merchant of the high seas. Somebody who means something in this world. I have told you nothing. Who I was and where I came from. You don't have to. I know. You came from the .. - From the sky. That was so nice. And I will never forget it. What you don't know Powdah, is that I am a servant. A lady's maid. I mean, I was. I was going to America just to .. Just to .. I am sorry, Powdah. Did I ever tell you about the sunflower? It looks up into the sun. Just like I'm doing to you. The sun ain't nothing. And you are. You are Babsie. Now I go at him. He made terrific lunge at me but .. You don't know Gaston de Bastonet. Do you know what happened? You know, you make me very nervous. If you don't mind. Please. I just .. Listen to me. I lunged at him. Say. The captain is entertaining a few choice friends. Don't you tell a soul, but he decided that you two are the choices. But Captain. We have .. Don't pay no attention to him, Captain. He's awfully shy. And he don't drink. You come along too. Come on everybody. We'll have some fun. Come on. Blades and foils are my entire life. Gentlemen, I brought you a few more hundred guests. Sit down next to your brother, Miss Tarryton. Go on, sit down. Miss. Sit over there opposite Mr de Bastonet. And you gentlemen. Sit right down there please. Have a good time. Make yourselves at home. Sit down. You know, folks. As captain of this ship I am supposed to be the law. Do you think it means anything to my crew? It doesn't. Please, Stanley. I'm having such a good time. Gentlemen, I give this to Mr de Bastonet. You're good with a blade. Will you slice the cheese please? And now for the wine. So you laugh because I tell you that duelling is a business, eh? If the Creoles wish to settle all the disputes only with a blade, then .. Who am I that should not wish to return to New Orleans .. And become a very rich man? Although duelling is unlawful. It seems that everyone who goes to America becomes a rich man. A very comforting thought. You think I'll like it, Mr Taylor? Especially the north. Despite de Bastonet's glowing picture I wouldn't advise you to go to the south. Not even Savannah? Definitely not Savannah. I don't insult you Mr Taylor but you speak from an empty head. Savannah is beautiful of course. Not as divine as New Orleans. But beautiful. Very beautiful. What do you think, Captain? It's a fair enough city to the eye but I never feel comfortable there. I'm a bit sentimental about the old William Brown. I never come to a harbor where she must lay near a ship that stinks of slavery. A lot of people look upon slaving as a perfectly legitimate business. Mr Taylor. It might be interesting to .. Know the viewpoint of someone actually engaged in it. They don't look upon slaving as a criminal occupation, do they? No. They don't. But they do consider it a dirty business. Hardly an occupation for a gentleman. And certainly no surroundings into which to take a woman. You speak from personal experience, of course? Naturally. Wait a minute. You will upset something. I knew a young fellow once. Young and rather handsome. Somewhat like yourself. He made the mistake of taking a woman, his wife, with him. To his trading post at the mouth of the river Bimbi in west Africa. You wouldn't understand what that young woman saw nor what she went through. She went stark, raving mad and stuck her head in a cauldron of boiling palm oil. Excuse me. Please keep your seats. I seem to have offended him. Miss Margaret. I am sorry. How could you .. - Miss Tarryton. Nuggin. I mean Mr Taylor. He didn't mean to hurt you. He said that because .. My brother was right. No-one but a real slaver could have talked the way he did. You mean, you think he's a slaver? Your brother didn't say why he's aboard this ship. I don't want to talk about it. - I do. I'll talk and you listen. He's no slaver. He never has been. I told Nuggin that story. I told him because I was there when it happened. I'm no 'merchant of the high seas'. I never have been. I'm the one who's been a slaver. A worthless good-for-nothing. I thought someday this would all be forgotten. When these things happen to the only man to speak a kind word to me in my life. I ain't fit to be in the same world with him. I am cheap. I am no good. I am nothing. I even stole a piece of poetry to tell you that you was beautiful. Babsie. I ain't never loved a girl. Before. I don't care what you've been. Why did you lie? You mean at the table? - Powdah told me. Powdah is a bit twisted in the head. - Why don't you answer me? May I ask you a question? Of course. Why are you making this voyage with your brother? There is no mystery about me. But .. My brother was leaving unexpectedly for America and .. And .. he just asked me to go along on the spur of the moment. There is nothing odd about it. I am glad I did it. So am I. Are you sure you're not making a mistake? I'm not a helpless child. I helped you once out of your carriage. And helped you with your sea sickness. A fellow in China once told me that .. If you help a person. On the third time you become one of the family. I wish I could help you again. Forget it. I never want to forget a thing about you. But when things start to happen. And things are bound to happen. Remember this. There's nothing you could have done to stop it. And nothing is going to stop me. Remember. Nothing. Papa said, because you were so nice to me. About the poetry I mean. He said I could give you my Indian toy box if I wanted to. And I want to. It plays music if you press the button. And if you wind it up it went like this. And this. And this. I bet it's a beauty. But you're not giving it to me after your father made it just for you. Yes I am. And you're going to keep it. Because, just like I told Papa. I think you're awful nice. If I was older I would marry you. Now you stay right here. When I come back I'll show you just how it works. Look. Come on you men. Gina. Gina. All hands on deck! All hands. On deck. Bring those seed sacks. Shut the door. Get over there. An unexpected visit but nonetheless welcome. Where did you get this letter? - You read it. Make your own guess. I don't have to guess. I know. It's a scheme to throw every slave ship into the hands of the British patrol. Very clever but it won't work. There will be no-one to deliver it. No? Only one of us will get to America. It's pretty evident it won't be you. Come on. Stack 'em up. Hey you. Start another row between the fire and the stern. Papa. Papa. Stanley. We can't leave him. I can't take both of you. I'll come back for him. Babsie. Powdah. Don't. Please don't. Don't leave me, Powdah. I won't. In the sky. Yes. To. A few minutes. What difference does it make? You meant it. Didn't you, Powdah? Then and always, Babsie. You and me. Well, Powdah. You. You made me so happy. You are? Did I ever tell you about the time I was a pirate off the China seas? China seas. Babsie. Babsie. I couldn't find him. He's gone from the cabin. Get away from that boat. That's the only lifeboat left. Take it away from him. - I'll club any man that tries to jump. I won't stay on this boat and die like a rat. If you start a panic you'll swamp this boat and you'll all drown. He's right. Leave the boat alone until everybody can go. Pull me in, will you. Get below. Get any food you can find and then go back and bring a keg of water. Stanley. The man is a maniac. He's mad. If he lives, not one of us will get a chance to .. Don't you even touch me. Come on. I'll hate you as long as I live. Hold on to that line. Nuggin. Where's Babsie? Get in the boat. Is there any .. Any more room anyway? Come on. Get in the boat. Nuggin. I just found out. What you meant about .. Sunflowers. You know. There's your safety. He is something to look up to. It's the only thing keeping the water out. Leave it in. Stuff that with clothes there. Plug up those holes. Get out the oars. Help him. We gotta have room to work. Some of you get over the side. Get over the side. We gotta have room to work. We gotta have more room. Get over and hang on. Don't foul the oars. Don't foul the oars. Leave them under the gunwales. Get off the spar or we'll capsize. Get off the spar and get under the gunwales. Spread fore and aft. With a willpower nothing could weaken, he brought that frail craft to safety. Then he went on to Savannah to finish his appointed task. When he decided to save his own life it was to further a great cause. Later, in this same room and faced with the danger of losing more than life. He made not the slightest move to save himself. I humbly crave the court's forgiveness for withholding my statement until now. The nature of our endeavour made secrecy until the last moment imperative. I thank the court for its courtesy in hearing me. There is no hand except my sovereign's. That I would feel more honoured in taking. To you Michael Taylor I am authorised to express my country's gratitude. You will be glad to know that since your arrest. The African slave trade suffered a set of blows from which it cannot recover. If the court pleases, the government joins with counsel for the defense .. In moving that the prisoner be granted a new trial. The motion is granted. The prisoner is remanded to the custody of the sheriff. ..s-d..
