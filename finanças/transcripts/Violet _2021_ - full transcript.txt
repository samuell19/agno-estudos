Pigeon. Hold on. Hold on. Just hold on. You're fat. Your hair is gross. You smell. You majored in the wrong thing in college. You don't have enough friends. Why don't you know how to cook? You don't remember enough people's birthdays. Everyone can see your weird body. You should be further along in your career. Yesterday there were three wood refinishers here, now there's no one. And I just want to cook dinner in my own house. - Hey, V. - Morning. You know, Bob was just telling me that it's going to be what, three weeks, tops? Isn't that right, Bob? We are doing everything we can... Yeah, three weeks, three weeks. Thank you, Bob. You're in the way. The guy's useless. He said he was gonna be done like a month ago. I know. Bob ruined my beautiful plans for our sequential renovations. I am so sorry. I really did not plan on you having to stay in a war zone. It's totally fine. I mean, my kitchen doesn't even have a roof right now. You look like a pig. You're seriously eating a Snoball for breakfast? Yeah, I'm trying to be ironic. Pig. Are you you're working in the guest house today? Yeah. I've got a fucking deadline on two scripts. Oof. Pig. Just text me if I can bring you anything back after work, all right? Uh, a new contractor, maybe like an extra quarter mil. What about a burrito? - That'll do. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. What are you wearing? You're like a baby. Why don't you have your own place? People are going to think you're a loser, staying at a friend's house. How do you expect people to take you seriously? Keith? Keith? Hey. Wasn't Julie reading these scripts? Yeah, yeah, she is. I mean, these are the other ones. They just came in from WME. All right. Can you give me a coffee please? Yep. Hey, sugar plum. Morning. Be nice. Did you get the production reports from Miami? You were cc'd on that email, Bradley. It's your responsibility. I know, I know. Hey, but you always make such good notes on yours. Share, don't be selfish. - Oh my God, I knew it. - I need it back. You're so funny that you print everything out. All right, I will let you get at it. Let it go or he'll quit. Oh, hey, did you get your production reports? Julie, you got coverage on the Argentinian scripts? Morning, Violet. Well, I just got them. I mean, Keith just gave them to me yesterday morning, so no. When would I have had time? Don't be bossy. - Whoa, hey, who were those from? - I don't know. I bet they're from the Phoenix financiers. Oh my God, yes Violet, they love you. I bet that's who they're from. Is that who they're from? - Don't you guys have something to do? - Attitude? Be nice. They are from Roger Vale from Universal. Really? Hey! And get me Charlie on the line. Oh, it's quite a pile of scripts you're mounting there. You're going to pick a winner for us today? You know it, Tom. What's with the flowers? They're from Roger Vale at Universal. Oh, yeah, well, all the studio executives love Violet. Isn't that true, V? Hmm? All right, come on guys, move on out of here. Get back to your own desk. Come on, come on. Violet's got a lot of work to do, so. Yeah, our boss was just talking to us about the flowers. Okay. - I don't get it. - Hmm? They're always standing here saying stuff. You just let 'em. - Who, Tom? - No he's just- No, no, no. I mean, Tom is... Look, I'm talking the other ones. - All right, Bradley and Julie? - Well they're, you know. No, no, no. You're head of production here, Violet. They work for you. You've produced a ton of stuff. They're always over here bothering you. Why don't you ever tell them to fuck off? Listen, it's just better for me to not say anything. The less opportunities I give them to label me a bitch, the better. If I'm quiet, it's better. If I just don't say anything, it's better. It's how everything works. Do you really think that? Keith, I've been doing this awhile. I know it. Huh. Doesn't that feel better? Hey, what are you doing? Stuff. I tried to call you before. I know, it's been going nonstop. I gotta get outta here. Let's meet at Jones. I can be there in 15. Great, I'll see you there, bye. I mean it's not perfect. His house is still under construction. Why did Red move back in? I thought he rented some other place until it was done. It was supposed to be by now, but whatever. Honestly, I can't complain. I'm just glad to have somewhere to stay during my construction. Yeah. I wish I could stay in that rocking house of his. Hmm, well the benefits of knowing someone for 20 years, I guess. You're a baby. I feel weird lately. Don't tell her. - Are you sick? - No, I just... The committee in my head. I just never really noticed it much before. What committee? You know the voice that tells you that you're a piece of shit or whatever. I mean, everybody has it. You know what I'm talking about. I guess. You sound crazy. I don't know, my parents always told me that I was great and so whenever I have like a bad thought or something, it just seems like a lie. Are you serious? Yeah, they told me I was great and I believed them. See, you're a freak. Jesus, you're like a unicorn. These are from that guy in the tie. Tie? Okay, studio exec or agent? I'm going to go with a studio exec. - Oh, you know him. - It's Roger Vale. - Really? - Mmm-hmm, yeah. Huh. You're not seeing him, right? I don't know, I guess. Why, what's wrong with Roger Vale? Oh come on, like last time- Hey. I got your table ready. Come on, when I decorated his Malibu place, you went with me to that party and you said you had never been so unattracted to anyone in your life. - What? I didn't say that. - Yeah, you did. That party was like, what, three years ago? Yeah. Well he's now the President of Production at Universal. So? So he's the type of guy I should be dating. That's right. Or something. Did the committee say that? I don't know. Because if they did, I'm just saying it might be a lie. Don't you think that Red is the type of guy you should be with? If you want people to think you're a loser. Oh my God, what are you talking about? No. Red and I have known each other since we were 12. And honestly, I don't see what everybody else sees in him. I mean, I've known him since before he even sold a script. And really, he's kind of a geek. No, no, no. My computer engineer boyfriend, he's a geek. Red is not a geek. You got to really lay down this picture of him at 12 years old and look at him now. Do you want to be a loser? He's not the kind of guy that's ever lonely, if you know what I mean. God, I've got two films going into production tomorrow. Oh, you should absolutely let me take a look at the set design for Fox Run. What? Fox Run, your favorite project. Oh, the film you thought could be art. No, that's not what I was talking about. I'm not doing that one. Oh. I just assumed Fox Run was one of the projects that was starting production tomorrow. Nope, nope, nope. No, why would you think that? I mean I just assumed. You put so much of your own money into getting the rights to the poetry book and then hiring someone to write the script. God, I really don't remember. I mean, it's like, we don't really do those kinds of films at Gaines, so... Hey, let's talk about something else. Okay. But didn't you say before that Kirk Paulson - wanted to direct it? - No. Okay, I didn't say that, all right. Or maybe we were drunk. I don't really remember saying anything like that. Well no, I remember because you were talking- Oh my God. Just drop it, Lila. Seriously, okay? It's none of your fucking business. Okay, sure. Man, this dinner. I'll see you later, Violet. There. Don't you feel better? That's my favorite, chocolate! You're retarded. Vanilla's the original. Violet, come on! You know they told the lionesses at the Zingapore Zoo to stop having babies? They're having way too many babies, like a hundred. Cubs. Lion babies are called cubs. Everyone knows that. I just like to call them babies. She can call them whatever she wants. They are babies anyway. - Whatever. - Look, my canteen's empty. I should have brought more water. Sam, you're gonna live. My house is just two more blocks. - Let's go. - I'm not going. Why not? You were going to help me. You have to come. After we're finished, Will's mom's going to make us ice cream sandwiches. Yeah. Will, you always ask us to help with your chores. Leaves in the bag, mowing the lawn, walking your dog. You're a slave driver. I've had enough. I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it. I quit! Wahoo! I'm not a slave driver. I'm not! Violet, where are you going? You said you would help us! - Violet! - Violet! Violet, Stop! Come with us! Violet! Violet! Where have you been? What are you wearing? How do expect people to take you seriously in that getup? Get in here. I thought you were helping Will with raking the leaves. I got a call from his mother. Honestly, you're like a baby. Oh, the guy that thinks you're an idiot. No, you put your credit card in first and then your parking spot number. Credit card first, then parking number. Leave them. Live a little freer. You're so rigid about rules, your routines, doing the right thing all the time. How do you even know what the right thing is? Loosen up. What are you afraid of? That the room's going to smell great when you come back? Leave the candles alone. You're so rigid. Don't be so responsible all the time. You think Martin wants that? If you don't show him you're more relaxed then he's gonna leave you. Violet? Wow, Martin. Wow. Hey. You live in Los Angeles? No, no. I'm just here for a couple of months with a project. Oh! Oh! Oh! Is this your... Yeah, this is my son. This is Gus. Say hi, Gus. Hello. Hi. - Speechless. - Jesus, no manners. So Violet, how are you? The last time we saw each other was... Great, great. I'm head of production over at Gaines Pictures. So, you know, still doing film. Yeah, I know. I really enjoyed Spanish Star, that was good. Thanks, yeah, that did really well. Got a couple of awards too. But, how are you? How's the arm, and... Ah, that was so long ago. That was so many years ago. Yeah, yeah, I guess so. So you married, kids? Oh, no. Why don't you have children? Tick-tock. Yeah. Violet, what happened? You know, honestly, I've just been so busy with work. I haven't really been able to think about it. He thinks you're a loser. I'm actually staying with Red right now. My kitchen is under construction because of all the rain. You remember Red, right? But I mean that's not anything... He's just an old friend. I get it. But, how are you? They just broke or something. I left the candles on, and... Oh. I should have blown them out before I left. - And I thought about it, I just... - What? - I thought about it. - What the fuck, Violet? What... All my stuff? I mean is everything gone, everything? I just thought it would be nice if I left them lit. I was just trying to make it smell nice. What the fuck are you talking about? Do you have any idea what was in that apartment? Do you know the value of anything? Fuck! Then how could you be so stupid? Are you a fucking idiot? Please don't say that. Fuck! You're the same as before. You haven't grown. You're the same and he knows it. He still thinks you're a fucking idiot, thinks you're below him. You're the same. You're the same. You're nothing. Your position at Gaines doesn't matter. Nobody cares about your stupid films. You'd better find some way to feel above him. or you'll stay down here. A little nothing. And then we're heading back to New York. Sue's pregnant with our second, but she's been a good sport with all the travel. Yeah well thank God I don't have any kids. I know what I would do if I were saddled with all that responsibility. I wouldn't get anything done. Hate to have to take care of fucking idiot like that. Nice. Don't you feel better now? V, you're back. Didn't know you were home. Yeah, I'm back. Should've come for a swim. Oh, I got a pile of scripts, but... You're fine. It looked good. Some good swimming? Heated and all that? What, you think I'm a tough guy or something? Of course it's heated. I turned that shit on like a week before I moved back in. You want a beer? Yeah, sure. Thanks. I saw Martin today. - Really? - It's funny, huh? Don't tell him anything. I guess. What, is he living there now? He's just out here for some music project. Well, that's valiant of him to still be a music exec these days. Yeah, I guess. You know, I don't actually know what the project is because he didn't say. Was it okay? Don't be weak, you're fine. Yeah, yeah. It was good. I mean... I haven't seen him in a really long time. I think the last time I saw him was seven years ago. I think. Well he's married now, I guess. And he has a kid. And I think he said he had another one coming. Or something. Something, huh? Something, yeah. Yeah. V, my little lover of executives, even way back then. Yeah, even way back then, baby. Even back then. I mean, God- I mean the first time Martin showed me If you look weak, Red will hurt you. his shiny new A&R card, I was hooked. Damn, that was a long time ago. And you still haven't grown out of it, huh? Come on, Red, what do you expect me to do, not date executives? Well... Don and Skip are going to pick me up for dinner. We're going to sushi. Do you want to come? Oh no. I'm good, thanks. But just bring me back some edamame. You got it. See ya. Red? Stop! Yeah? It didn't go well. With Martin. I was just so uncomfortable and I wanted... I just didn't want to be there. Well, that's totally understandable. Yeah, I just didn't want to feel that way, so I did something bad. And I was mean. That's okay, you can fix that. No... What? No, no, I... I know exactly what he'd say, so. Maybe you don't. Um, oh... Hey, you have people to meet, right? Good girl. - Yeah. - Okay. I think sometimes you think you can't trust me with your feelings, but you know you can. Door's always open. Hmm, you're making your own coffee? What's going on, hmm? Keith went home early, wasn't feeling well. Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. Well, that's unusual. Be nice. Oh, it's fine. You know, Violet, I've been thinking, you should make me a lead executive on a film or two. You have a lot of films in production right now and you know, to have situations like this, where Keith is going home sick and so forth? You need help. Really? Um... Don't be a bitch. I think coverage in production report summaries are a good place for you right now. Really? Is Darren here yet? Oh, I don't know, I'm just about to go in. - Darren Brightly? - Yeah. Yeah I think I saw him in the parking lot, finishing up a call or something. Well tell Kathy to bring him in. Wait, wait. Is he going to be directing Fox Run? Is that what this meeting is about? What are you... Don't cause a scene. Fox Run... Wasn't that that abstract poetry thing you had a couple of years ago? You know, it was a long time ago. Yeah no, that was your baby. You loved that project. No, I mean, I had it and I talked about it, and I haven't talked about it in a while. Oh my God, you still want to do it, don't you? You were always such a pussy for those art films. Jesus, Violet. Hey, maybe we should bring Darren up now. Bradley, you were getting Darren. Yeah, sure. Sure, boss. So Phillip finally sent over the specs for the animated gameplay for Fire Flame. Got it on my laptop if you want to go over it before Darren comes up. Do I need to? No, not really. They incorporated all of our notes. So I think that's what we were trying to go for. So, Fox Run... You still want that? I know that it was important to you. Um... No, it's okay. What? Tell me. It's really unique. Oh really? How? In what way? Just the insight into relationships and their delicacies is really profound. Huh. Really? The script adaptation of the poetry is honestly, one of the best I've ever read. He captures the braiding and unbraiding of both of their lives and just this metaphor that... Well, it's next level, you know what I mean? It's next level screenwriting. You get a director in who wants to push the envelope, and actors doing another level of acting, and the cinematography, everything... We can really break some rules with this one. Hey, I got to run. Darren. Okay, hi. One second. I'm off the phone now, I'm jumping. Shit, all right, oh my God. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. - Tom, how are you? - Darren, good. Hey, Darren. - Hi. - How you doing? Nice to see you. - Good to see you, too. - Sorry about the phone thing. It's just fucking post on Metro Doll, man. The producers, not you guys, some other fucks, they wouldn't listen to me about the special effects team. And guess what? It's a fucking disaster. They're trying to band-aid the whole thing. - Anyway- - Apologize for that. Fuck it. Who cares? Let's talk Fire Flame. Yeah, well, it sounds like a drag, sorry about that. It's all right. Fire Flame. So, all right. I have some interesting casting choices and I feel pretty strongly about them. So if I can show you those... They are not going to be popular choices - with foreign markets. - Well, don't worry about that. - Let's see the choices. - Here we go. Oh, also we got the companion video for the game specs of Fire Flame, so we can go over that after. Well, forget casting, let's look it that. You got it? Yeah, of course, yeah. Okay, so they sent the initial layout and then Tom and I gave our notes, right? But, you were... Was that the week that you couldn't do it- Oh it was the location fiasco with fucking Metro Doll. Right, right. Okay, so. They incorporated our notes, but we want your notes as well, just because we want to be on the same page. Please. Now remember when we had that conversation about the social media connection and how we wanted it to be more than just the user posting that they liked it? Definitely. Okay, so check this out. Check out right here. Check out the game avatar and then look at the left, right? Yeah, the word cloud. So your social media posts, like Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, whatever source you wanted, it all scrapes them for this, like an emotionally related word, like happy, excited, you know, angry, disappointed. And then your game avatar's costume and its mount is transformed. Both in what it looks like and what it's capable of doing. I like to say it's like a mood ring for your abilities in the game. - Super cool. - Right, right. Can you look at, check on, yeah click that. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Doesn't she just knock your socks off? Violet is great. There's nothing better than watching her get all excited about a new project. Yeah well, I love what I do. And she doesn't just get passionate. She gets frothy. Don't you, Violet? Don't cause a scene. Just today, in fact, right before you walked in, she was telling me about some project she's got. And I'd heard about it before. I heard about it a long time ago and I thought it was a pretty fucking waste of time then, but Violet's got an itch about it. So I couldn't resist letting her get all passionate about it again, if you know what I mean. God, she needs so little encouragement and then she goes. It's like, she's getting off on it. Right, Violet? Tom, come on, man. No, Violet's fine with this. It's fine, it's fine. Violet and I go way back. We know each other, we know each other very well. And I can't help but want to see her get excited about some new project. Even if it's something I'll never do in a million fucking years. Isn't that right? You're really into it, right? I love the video game and I love Fire Flame. You want to talk about your casting thoughts? Because I'd love to hear them. - Yes. - Sure. Okay. Well, like I said, not popular choices. Let me see it. Okay. Okay, so, casting. You did that right. Now you're safe. You'll never find your way back to that kind of freedom. This is so annoying. I'm gonna text him. Red. Hurry, asshole. Your friend, Rita. Hi, hey. You waiting for Red? - Oh Violet. Hey, it's Rita. - Oh, hey. - How are you doing? - I'm doing good. It's good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - You waiting for Red? Yeah, we're going to a screening tonight if Red can get out of the house in time. Yeah, I'm supposed to go to a screening myself too, but I think I might blow it off. God I wish I could blow this off, too. It's my dad's film so I have to... Red, we got to go! You know, I'll go get him. I'm going in. - Okay. - It was good to see you. - Have fun. - Bye. Oh, I had the wrong Red. Oh my God, I texted the wrong Red. Oh shit. This is gonna be so good. That guy's going to kill me. Red, Rita's waiting. Hey, V. Yeah, I told her to wait. I just want to see what happens in this race. Oh! Oh, that's over. What's wrong? No, I'm fine. What's the matter? I don't know. It's just the same stuff. I don't wanna make a big deal. Don't you have like a screening to go to? I'll catch up with them later. I hear the movie sucks anyway. Hey, Rita! Hey, you guys go ahead. I'll catch up with you at the party. You owe me one! Red, I didn't want you to... Honestly, I just don't want to make a big deal out of it. Bullshit. Okay, what's the matter. It's just a bad day, okay, I just... I don't even know why I'm so upset about it. Tom was such a dick. Oh Christ, what did he say? No, it just... You know, he's always a dick so I shouldn't be surprised by it. It's just that today he just did a turn that I wasn't expecting. I just didn't see it coming. Tom is a first-class asshole. Okay, I'm thrilled that I'm on his "will not produce" list. I know. He just lured me into it this time. It's all this interest and openness. God, I just don't feel like I'm on top of things. Like I was doing it right for so long. And then now it's like, I'm just not doing it right. Not doing it right? Yeah. Like not doing things correctly? Yeah, yeah. Like when you're doing things right, everything's fine. You know, you're safe. Safe, hmm. Safe, like, you know nothing bad's gonna happen to you. Well can you give me an example? I don't know. Like when you have to wear the right dress to a party or go to the right college or... What are you doing? I'm sorry, am I doing this wrong? Oh my god, yes! Yes, you're doing it completely wrong. - Okay. - Can you turn it down? Okay, okay. I just did that wrong. But we're still safe, I think. - Aren't we? - Yeah. You're a good friend. That's right. Okay, well have fun at your party. Got one car. Two cars. Okay, here we go. One, two. Fucking awesome! - Did you love it? - It's fantastic. Okay. Bernard! Third time's a charm, great shit. Did you like it? Okay, okay. All right, how long was that? Okay, that's good. Okay. What's next? Rick? Hey. What's going on, everything okay? Yeah, everything's good. Oh. Yeah, just thought I'd call. It's been a while. Yeah, look, I'm at... You at work? Yeah. Yeah, so am I, Violet, so am I. Fuck you! I picked up cause I just thought, you know that something happened. No, no. I have Aunt Helen here. - Oh? - Yeah it's a special day. No, is it? It's her birthday, Violet, her birthday. You remember? She doesn't remember anything. Right, right. Yeah, so she stopped by here for a little visit. Let me have the phone. Violet, honey. It's your Aunt Helen. Hi, Aunt Helen. Well hello to you. It's been awhile. So I'm here at your brother's office. The girls are taking me out to lunch at French spot to celebrate my birthday. And I thought I'd drop by Rick's office. It's so good to see him. I wish we could see you more. Yeah, you know, it's just really hard with my work schedule. Well, everyone works, Violet. No, I know, I just meant- It's fine. What is she saying now? It's fine. So for Christmas maybe? Maybe. You need to come out. You haven't been here much at all since your father died. - I have to- - Have to what? Book a flight? Happy birthday, Aunt Helen. Can I talk to Rick? She is so ungrateful. You know, she hasn't talked to her mother in three years. Well that's because she's a big deal now in the movie business. Isn't that right, baby sister? Fuck you! Thanks for calling, Rick. I got to go back to work. Well, we're all very proud of you, Violet. Thanks, Rick. We all know you're just doing your best. Fuck you. - Bye, Rick. - Bye-bye, Violet. Oh, sorry I'm late, fucking 405. That freeway is the devil. Feels like whenever you get on, it's jammed. I'm glad you called. Are you good with time? I know you have a meeting. Oh, it's all right. My meeting's not till 11. Forget it, I know what I want. The lemon thing and a cappuccino. - Are you going to get anything? - No, I just ordered. Oh my God, what modeling agency did they get all these waitresses from? I know, it's like they make them show their lookbook before they apply for the job. I'm sorry I snapped at you the last time. Stop. Don't worry about it. I was mad at you. I know. I was mad at you for saying that you just live your life without some voice telling you that you're a piece of shit or not enough or whatever. I don't even know why I listened to that. Stop. And now I don't know why things are different, why I'm so aware that the way I've always been doing things just doesn't work now. Like I've been telling myself to do certain things or act a certain way or else something bad will happen to me. Or the committee's been saying that, whatever. And if that's a lie, and nothing's ever going to happen, then it means I've spent my life not doing things or not being the way that I wanted to be. And what way do you want to be? Thank you. Don't tell her. I want to be free. I don't want to be afraid of some terrible outcome 'cause that doesn't feel like me now. And I don't know if it ever did. It's just in me. That's right. Maybe you cast yourself in a part that you don't want to play anymore. Yeah. But I'm scared to do things differently. Maybe that's an okay feeling to have. But do things differently anyway. This is a bad idea. This is not going to make you feel better. You're just going to feel worse. It's just going to make you feel bad again, make you feel like a fucking idiot again. Blow this off, you're fine. Don't. Don't. - Hello? - Violet? - It's Martin. - You're fine. - Hey. - Hi. How are you? Good. I saw your message. Right. Stop. I just wanted to call to say that I'm sorry. Violet, it was an accident. What? The fire. Oh, I wasn't... No, with your son at the parking lot. Oh. I was really rude that I called him that. Oh Violet. No, it's okay. I know you didn't mean it. It was an uncomfortable situation. I can't imagine how you felt. The last time we saw each other wasn't great. Yeah. You know, I've been kind of a puss to not call you after all this time even just to see how your arm was or anything, but, I did want to tell you that you meant a lot to me. He doesn't mean that. And honestly, when we were together, you just caught me when I was in a really selfish phase of my life. I didn't... Well, I see it now. Wow. I guess it took me getting married and having a kid to see things right. I'm really sorry for how I was with you. Thanks. Sure. Well, listen, I'm really glad that you messaged. I have to get going. I've got to figure dinner out, it's my turn. Okay. - Martin? - Yeah? Stop. I am really sorry about the fire. I think I was not really being myself and I made a stupid decision because of that. Violet, it's okay. Really? Yeah. It's really okay. You should just forget about it. It was a long, long time ago. Okay. Stay in touch, Violet. Thanks, Martin. Okay, well then, Venice is out, so probably, probably Telluride... But you're shooting Coral and Sand then, right? Yeah, in prep. Prep, okay. Well if we can do Toronto- Violet. Hi, how are you? - Good to see you. - I am great now. Hey. We were just having lunch out on the patio. I can't believe we're all here together, we didn't know. Yeah, hey Fred. How's CAA treating you? Ah, I'm just there for the nice offices. - You guys know Janice Miller. - Hey, Janice. - Yeah, hi. - How you doing? - Hi. - Well, I know of her and it's nice to meet you finally. Lion's Den is my wife's all-time favorite movie. Oh geez, it's so old. Why don't you get her to watch Game Plan or Sailor? Well, they're all great and we have seen them all. So Dennis and Harry are the principals of Phoenix Circle Films and we've done a lot of movies together. They financed a lot of them like Spanish Star is one. Festival award- winning Spanish Star. Oh, we were just talking about film festival schedules for our film. Oh. Trying to get Janice to as many as possible, of course. Sorry guys, I gotta take this. Sure, yeah. Yeah? He is trying to get us to fund a ridiculous action film, but the script has no second act. Or first. Or first. Well look, you guys are good at picking winners. Just stick to that gut instinct, you know? You know who picks good winners? - You. - He doesn't mean that. - Well, I try. - I agree. How are things at Gaines Pictures? It's good, it's good. We're starting prep on Fire Flame. - It's good. - Okay, good. Yeah I just want to make sure you're getting to do what you want over there, because we are branching out a bit and we would love to somehow steal you away and have you come work for us. Like, directly? If Tom finds out about this, he'll sue you. I think it's something we should talk about. Oh, um. You'd be a complete joke if you've ever worked at their company. Wow, I'm really flattered. Thank you so much. I just- They don't know the film business. You know, it's just going really good at Gaines right now and we have a lot cooking, so... - Understood. - Yeah. That's good, but thank you. I would love to bring you guys some films we can get going. You can finance, we can work together again. Our door is always open for you. Great to see you. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Nice job offer. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't even know why they would... I mean, I can't do that. I've known Tom Gaines for a really long time and I started my career there. Honestly, I don't even think I could do this without Tom. We've got your film to finish up, so... Can't argue with that. See? Now you can keep your career. Excuse me, I'm just here to pick up my car. Soon as they see a woman come, they jack up the price. What is it? It's just that one over there. What's your name? Calder. Violet Calder. Don't take this price. Whatever he gives you, he's trying to rip you off. He's not taking you seriously because you're a woman. Okay. Here it is. Four tires. So that's going to be $395. You take that price and then he's going to hard sell you a bunch of shit you don't want. It will never stop. Okay. What are you doing? It's a great deal. We had a sale on those tires and still had four left. Oh? Yeah, they usually go for $120 apiece. So I got a discount? They were on sale. Here you go. But don't you want to tell me about some product or something? What's that? Don't you want to tell me about some product? Sorry, did you need to get something else? No. Have a good day. Thanks. You, too. Answer it. What are you doing? That's the fourth call, you're fucking up. You're making a big mistake. You're never going to work with Universal again. You'll be blackballed. You'll never get a project off the ground again. That's bullshit. What did you say? All right, so we get there. Gregory is the first one on the hang glider, right? He's with the instructor. He's okay, he's fine, he's ready to jump. - So it's tandem. - Yeah, of course. Tandem. - They think you're stupid. - We're on location and it was an off day. I had no idea this was happening. So he's with the instructor and they glide off, straight off the cliff. They don't want you here. They go up, up, up, they come down. Everything is okay. Everything is perfect, good. Now it's Juliana's turn. She's with the other instructor. You're not cool enough to be here. She's got the harness on and she's fine. I mean, she was nervous before, but I told her she's gonna be okay. It's easy, no problem. So they run, run, run, run, run. - They're cooler than you. - To the edge of the cliff, they jump. And the glider drops. Oh my God. Oh my God. Is he amazing? My director takes the two lead actors hang-gliding while we're halfway through shooting. - I could have killed him. - What happened to Juliana? Okay, so they run, they jump, the glider drops. Gave me a heart attack. Thank you. So we run to the edge of the cliff and I'm like, "Oh my God, I just killed my lead actress. I killed my lead actress." I looked down, and they are there. They are much lower, but they're gliding now. They're all gliding. So we run to the beach. They come down. The instructor, I'm not joking. The instructor was white as a ghost. Like white as his shirt and tie. Very nice. And he tells me, "This has never happened before. And we are lucky to be alive." And he says, "Like the wind, I don't think the wind is right for gliding today." Yeah. He hit a dead pocket of air. The glider just fell, like boom. So then Juliana comes. Her harness is off. And she's so excited! Her face is so alive. Like she loved it, she wanted to do it again. And she had no idea. She had no idea she almost died, none. Next time I put two PA's on you and you do not leave their sight. Mmm, Red! - What's up? - Michele. Oh, you're back. How was Santa Barbara? I mean the couple of hours it wasn't overcast was nice. - How was it, how was the film? - It was good, it was good. Yeah? I mean, I see things that I want to change, but I gotta, - I gotta stop. - Yeah. What? He's being modest. It was a great screening. I'm starving. I'm going to go eat all that food over there. Oh, I'm coming. - Do you want anything? - I'm good, thanks. I didn't think you'd come in time. I knew you'd be here, and this. I know this guy, how long has it been now, 10 years? - Yeah. - Since Ibiza. Michele's better friends with Red than you are. I know you know him longer, but I know him from a long, long, long time. Oh I bet you two were trouble there, huh? It's Ibiza. - That it is. - You never been? No, not Ibiza. Violet goes to Europe a lot for work. Then you haven't been there, then. You'd only go for festivals and work? Yeah. No, no, no, you haven't been there. You have to... Tell her. Well- My parents own a hotel in Positano, okay. So next time I'm there, I want you both to come and I'll show you Italy. I'll show you the real Italy. Both of us? Yeah. That sounds fun. What are you doing? Yeah? Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. Love it. So how's everything, man? Good. Oh, the executives. I'll be right back. Brother. Congratulations. Yeah, Red. You climbed the mountain and you made it big. - Violet. - Connie, great party. You look gorgeous. Oh, come on, this is just something I'm wearing for work. Something's different. You look different. Maybe. Mmhmm. Howard! Happy birthday! Hi. - Hi. - Violet. Roger, hi. How are you? - Good, good. You? - I called you. I know. You'll pay for not answering those calls. Well, kind of a different party. Oh, you've never been to one of Connie's parties before? Nope. Well, I always have fun at them. It's a bit of a messy mix of people, isn't it? Ooh. I guess. You know Bernard. This is Astrid Becker and Ron Moore. - Hey. - Hi, how are you? Did you see the film? I already did, yeah. It wasn't for me. Oh? If you say you're different, they won't work with you. I don't go for that arty stuff. I agree, it's too complicated. Give me a simple story, a grand musical score. That's what works. Yeah, you can't argue with that. And I think the rest of the country would agree with you. Really? I didn't really find it that arty. Arty enough. Yeah. You're gonna sit with us? Maybe for a minute. Okay, go ahead... There's an empty chair over there, grab it. Dirty Martini. Violet. Kirk. Wow, hi. - How are you? - I'll have a Corona. I'm good. God, it's been so long since I last saw you. Yeah, I've been in Budapest for five months on this last film. Right, yeah, well, how'd that go? - It was- - Kirk! I'm so happy you came. - You made it. - Connie! I love you! What a beautiful suit! Get out of here, I'm gonna throw you in the pool. You better. Oh God, she's the best. Hey, listen. What's going on with Fox Run? Oh, I'm not really sure. Well, you know I want to direct it, right? It will destroy your career. I just think it might be too Humiliating, embarrassing? Violet. Promise me you're making this film. God, it's so funny that I'm running into you tonight. Yeah, I was in fucking Budapest for five months. It's like really, really funny. Yeah. So Fox Run... Are we gonna get this going? You can't do this. Let me think about it. Yeah, do think about it and don't do it with anybody else. Stop. Stop. - Hey. - Hey. I think I've been doing the opposite of what I wanted to do for a long time. Now I know why you look so good. Thanks for the great party, Connie. Have a nice night. Goodbye. Oh my God. Oh my God is right. A screenwriter? You're gonna be with a screenwriter? This is career suicide. Turn the car around. Think of everything that you've worked for. Now turn the car around and go back to the party. You can tell Red you forgot something. But you go back and you sit with Roger. Hell, you sit with another executive, anyone. You are gonna be thought of on a lower scale if you do this. This is a huge mistake. Now you'll be thought of well by the people you do business with. Now you have a chance to have a career you can be proud of. Now you have a chance to succeed. Now you can really make something of yourself. That doesn't even make any fucking sense. Hi. Hi. Oh my God, what? I'm doing it. What do you mean? I'm not listening to it, to the committee, to that voice. - Ooh, breaking the rules! - Yeah. Like what? Thanks. Well, like, I'm wanting to do things differently at work, I think. I'm gonna give Fox Run some thought. That's good. And the other night, I was at this party with Red. Oh, I knew it, I fucking knew it! I told you. Lila, I don't know what happened. Red's just different to me now. Oh my God, that's great! Look, I don't know what's gonna happen with Red now. I don't know if I just completely fucked up our friendship. No, you haven't. It's just, I'm just going with it, so- Violet, wow. Yeah. Hey, his house is finished, okay, so he's doing this big party. It's on the 17th. I'll be there. Okay. You know I'm scared. But like not in a way I used to be. Like I'm scared now because I don't understand this way. I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't know if I ever really knew. I mean I always thought that I knew what would happen but maybe I really didn't. And now I know I really don't know. Don't worry, that made sense. Hey, Violet. Oh. Hi, Bradley. Violet, you know that whole Fox Run thing the other day, you know, with Tom? Give him whatever he wants. Well I just, I didn't realize that was something you didn't want to talk about. I'm so sorry about that. Sure. Hey, don't you have a friend who's one of the guys that runs Coachella? You know, the music festival? Yes. Well, Kanye is playing there again this year and I really wanna go, but you know, but with like passes to the parties- Give him whatever he wants. Do it right. So, could you talk to him? Bradley, you have work to do. You need to be focused on your production reports summaries. In fact, I'm gonna pull half the scripts you're supposed to do coverage on, that way you have more time for the reports. Oh. Oh, also, I'd like you to create Excel spreadsheets for the report summaries then merge them with Powerpoint presentation for our investors. I don't know how to do that. Google a tutorial. Okay... Hey, guys, is this a party? Violet, here's coverage on one of the Argentinian scripts. It's not bad. Where are the other ones? I'll get to them later. Julie, you're gonna have a new schedule. I'm tossing over half of Bradley's scripts for you to cover. I'll need three a day. Oh... Okay... Okay, I have to work. God, I guess she's serious. If you don't like it, I hear they're hiring at Staples. Oh, are they doing original content now, Keith? V! Hey V! Violet! I just had lunch with Scott and I think this is our next script. Okay, I'll check it out later. No, no. You'll call Roger Vale over at Universal and you get this setup over there now. Do what he says. What is the issue? Give Tom what he wants. No, it's, uh... Well this should be easy. You're fucking him, right? It wasn't... No, I'm not really, um... It's not really. You're either fucking him or you're not fucking him. Which is it? That's none of your business. Really? Huh. He's your boss. Look, I don't mind calling Roger Vale. It's just, my personal life is none of your business. Wow. Well it used to be. That was once, a long time ago. I gotta get back to work, okay? Yeah, we did fuck a long time ago and as I remember, that's how you got this job. Hmm? When I met you, you were running errands for some ad guys. What was the name of that agency, something out of Chicago? You were nothing. I gave you everything that you had. So don't tell me that your personal life is none of my fucking business because the minute you started using your personal life for work, I owned it. You're nothing. When I met you, this company was producing background story segments on athletes for sports shows. You're fucked now. When I came here, I had to push you to expand. I'm the one who convinced you to get into feature films. I'm the one who showed you, no, guaranteed you that your profits would increase if you got into the movie business. I got eight films off the ground here. Five of those, the ones I oversaw directly, all profited and were award-winning. The financing from half those films all came from my direct connections, so I hardly think that you gave me everything. You really want to get into a pissing match here? Is it my turn? This my cue to whip out my dick? Hmm? You can do whatever you want with your dick. I did everything. I made this company. You are fucked now. Get the fuck out of my office. You are done. You are fired- Where are you going? Going to get my stuff. Oh really? You want your stuff? You want your stuff? I will get your stuff. Here we go, here's your stuff. Here's your stuff. Here, here! You want your stuff? Here, here! Good luck out there, you're gonna need it. No one will work with you. You won't know what to do without me. That's true. Phoenix Circle Films. Hi. Give me Dennis, please. Red! In here. I did it. What? I'm working with Phoenix Circle Films. Ah! President of Production. - Yes, that's fucking awesome. - You're going to fail. You deserve it. I think one of our first films is going to be Fox Run. Good, that's awesome. Guaranteed failure. You know maybe you could start producing some of my films, now there's no Tom Gaines embargo on it. God... You really scared the shit out of him. Mhmm, yeah, he was very intimidated by you. Good looking guy, smart, talented, creative, funny. Oh, and also, he really hated the fact that you and I have been old friends forever. Mmmm. God, you really taste good. Man, let me get a jar of jelly, I'll make a sandwich. Ugh, it's my brother. This is your family. Rick, what's going on? What? Oh. Wait, how? Okay, yeah. My mom just died. And where were you? Oh, shit, V. I'm so sorry. You never did enough for her. I didn't know she was sick. Was she sick? I don't know. I don't know. You know, I just haven't talked to her in a really long time. You're so selfish. She had a heart attack. I mean I knew she had heart issues, I just, it was never really a thing. V... V. Yeah? Are you okay? Um, I don't really feel anything. You're probably in a little bit of shock. I don't feel like I'm in shock, I just don't feel anything. The funeral is in a couple of days. It's the same night as your party. Okay. Yeah. Hey. I'm here for you. That's too L.A. That's more appropriate. Now you'll be taken seriously. Hey. I'm just gonna run to the store, get some stuff for the party tomorrow. Okay. You sure you don't want me to fly with you to Michigan tonight? 'Cause I'll cancel this fucking party. I don't care. God, my mom was such a bitch. I know. I remember. And I haven't gone back there forever. I mean after my dad died, I didn't really have a reason to go back there anymore. Just more of my brother and my aunt trying to rub dirt in my face over the fact that I work in the movies. I mean, honestly, I don't know who I'd be going back there for. For my mom, who just tried to rip me apart my whole life? My asshole brother and my shaming aunt, I guess. Jesus. Whatever. Trip won't be that long, I guess. Don't go. What? Don't go. What do you mean? Well, why would you be going? Because... Because I'm supposed to. Well, fuck that. You can't skip this. This isn't a choice. You go. You get your ass up and you go. Get in the car! If you don't leave now you're gonna miss that flight. Get up! Get up! All right, if you guys wanna set up near the fire pit and I'll be down there soon. Hey. Hey. You look good. Thank you. Yeah, funeral's going on right now. How's it feel? This is bad. It's really, really good. Okay. Answer it. This is your family. Oh hey, Violet! - Hey, congratulations on the new job! - Thanks. - Red told us all about it! - Uh-huh. So wait, does this mean like I'm not the first person you call when you get news anymore? - Uh huh. - I'm kidding. - We love you. - We're so proud of you. It's gonna be really good. It's going to be terrible. Oh, okay! All right. Crazy party. Congratulations again. - Yes, yes, congratulations. - Thanks, guys. - Fred! - Violet. You made it! Yeah, oh, this is your party? Oh, weird. Yeah I was just driving by, I saw a line of cars, I thought, I'm gonna crash that. Yeah right. You want a drink? Yeah, I wouldn't be a good party crasher if I didn't drink all your alcohol. Hey, I'm excited about you at Phoenix Circle Films. Thanks. Red had more details than Variety. Oh yeah, well Red's my publicist now. It's gonna be really great to build the film department. Well, next week you should stop by the office. I mean everyone there is gonna want to talk to you about this. They want to laugh at you. Yeah, no, seriously. You were the only one worth dealing with at Gaines Pictures. I mean Tom's not gonna know what to do without you there. Yeah, you're probably right. I know. I gotta get this. Yeah. Have mine. Okay. There he is. Hi, Rick. You're in big trouble. What the hell? Where were you? Why weren't you at the funeral? Honestly, I just couldn't think of a good enough reason to be there. What the fuck does that mean? Mom wasn't nice, Rick. She was not a nice person. She was really mean to me. I can't believe what I'm hearing. I thought you were gonna say that you were sick or that you got into a car accident or something. And that's why you couldn't make it, not that you just decided to not come. I know Aunt Helen tried to call you. But nobody picked up. We didn't know what to think. Rick, I just didn't want to go. Jesus, you're a piece of fucking work. You know what I don't understand? You were there too, with Mom. Okay? When we were kids, you saw all of that. Saw what? Saw how she was with us. How she never gave a shit about us, how she was always trying to rip us down, never had anything nice to say to us unless Dad was around. She was your mother, Violet, your mother. Well, that doesn't mean anything to me. You just can't go around treating people like shit and then just get away with it, okay? It doesn't matter what title you have. You know what I do see here? I see you making decisions that suit your lifestyle. Your Hollywood life out there. Yeah, that's what this is about. You go to your parties and your movies and you think that you can just do whatever you want with no responsibilities, not care about anybody but yourself. But you know what, Violet? You know what does that? A baby. A baby just thinks of itself day and night. You are just a selfish little baby. Rick, never call me again. What exactly is the plan here? Oh so what, you're just not gonna have a family now? You don't have very many left. Your dad's dead, your mother's dead. Now you're gonna cut off your aunt, your brother? Shut up. I don't fucking care. Well if you thought you felt alone before, you have no idea what's about to come. Yeah, like what? You know that pit in your stomach you felt all through your childhood that you thought would go away when you finally moved out? Well, it never left, it's been sleeping. And it will grow bigger and bigger until you are aware of that ache all the time. And then what? And then, you will cut off more people and more people, and that pit in your stomach will grow and cover you. And then no one will even want to come near you. They will stop trying to be near you. They will recoil from you. And then what? Then, you'll be alone with this pit covering you like a black cancer. And you will be alone. Alone. Alone. And then what? And then you will die! And then what?
