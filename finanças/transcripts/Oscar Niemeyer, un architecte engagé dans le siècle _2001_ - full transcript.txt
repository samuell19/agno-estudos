I am not attracted by a right angle, or a straight, hard, inflexible line invented by man. I'm attracted by a free, sensual curve, the curve I see in the mountains of my country, in the winding rivers, the waves of the sea, the body of the woman I love. Curves make up the Universe, the curved Universe of Einstein. My name is Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida de Niemeyer Soares. They call me Oscar Niemeyer, I don't know why... Ribeiro and Soares are Portuguese names. Almeida is probably an Arab name. Only Niemeyer is German. It's different, so it stuck. My name has four different origins : black roots, maybe an Indian hidden somewhere in the family tree. I'm of mixed blood and I'm proud of it. The last project I carried through was the Niteroi Museum, a very well located building which pleases me greatly. The building was easy to design as the site was like this: the sea surrounds it completely. The problem was the vertical resting point. The idea of its architecture came to me by doing this, something like a flower. I didn't want to have two blocks on top of each other, I wanted one single line like this, which summarises the whole project. Next I outlined the landscape. I designed the building like this. The inside walls are more rectilinear. I designed a gallery from which to view the fantastic scenery. There's a ramp that comes here. People stand there, outside. I enjoyed creating this ramp which invites people to enter the beautiful architecture of the museum. A curious visitor will enter with even more pleasure. The Niteroi concept came to me spontaneously. The shape came into being like a flower. Some think it looks like a flying saucer because of the knoll above it. But it's not. This is the idea. I've designed other projects, many of them. There are about 500 projects here which required no effort at all. It was sheer pleasure working at my drawing board, imagining. Architecture was a natural choice for me. Up to the age of twenty, I wasn't thinking of anything in particular. My life was easy-going until I got married and needed to earn a living. Architecture is the path I chose. I bore in mind Le Corbusier's phrase: "Architecture is invention." It must be different, innovative, triggering astonishment and surprise. When I started working, architecture was rigid, full of right angles. There was nothing like the new technology of reinforced concrete. There was so much scope for an architect's imagination. So my first concern was to understand the existence of the curve, its importance and the fact that when you need to cover a wide span, the curve is a natural solution. This first phase was a liberation in terms of form: the use of curves in architecture. That's when I designed the Pampulha Church in 1940. I used curves all over the church. In the same spirit, the ballroom and the yacht club were built around the lake. The ballroom restaurant had an awning made of curves. I believed the curve was essential. Juscelino Kubitschek had been elected mayor. He wanted me to design a whole district, something different located near a dam at Belo Horizonte, something fantastic. He even specified: "I want the casino project by tomorrow." It was a challenge, as you can imagine. But I was young, so I rose to meet it. I returned to my hotel. I worked all night and finished it. And that's how my career as an architect took off. Sometimes one produces something with a certain originality, as in poetry. Not something inflexible, a problem to be solved with a square and a ruler, rather something which comes unbidden, like a dream. With my very first project, I realised I had to call upon artists, I had to revive the integration of plastic arts started at the Renaissance. The church of Pampulha remained unused for six years, because it did not suit the religious authorities. It should have been made in the style of the old Minas Gerais churches. They did not understand that it is not a question of ancient or modern. Architecture is either good or bad. My concern is for architecture to fit in with the ground, so that it does not change the slope of the plot. My house at Canoas is a good example. The ground was like this. I placed the living room here and the bedrooms downstairs, I didn't touch the ground. The roof came afterwards in this shape and there's a wall here, the slab fits in like this and here is a rock that I left untouched and put the pool here. The shape of the swimming pool fits in the area naturally. The trees have grown to complete the composition. Architecture is full of such secrets. It must fit in perfectly, that's all there is to it. I love coming back to see the houses I used to live in, and remember how beautiful they were and the lifestyle I enjoyed there. They are like people worn over time, more fragile each day. A house is important, it's the place we live in, the place where we suffer, laugh and cry. Those feelings make me want to return to remember times past. We used to go and walk in the Botanical Gardens. I enjoyed strolling along the gravel paths to see the exuberant green tropical growth, to stop at each plant, read its scientific name, so complicated. Anita followed me contentedly, Anna Maria ran joyfully ahead. How beautiful nature is! It grows and spreads. It maintains a structural logic within each of its secrets. It's like Capoéra. This dance was originally aggressive, for fighting. - It's beautiful. In the past, they used their fists. Now it's done with swords. The Japanese take this seriously. Nowadays, it has lost its meaning. I remember this place very well. Such vivid memories. I used to come here as a child and after I got married. I would draw the trees, seeking to capture the spirit of each plant. A drawing that would become architecture later on... I enjoyed those moments. Brazilian civilisation is a result of the European civilisation introduced here by the Portuguese. They settled in Brazil, locking it into a straitjacket, especially in cultural terms, where it was at a disadvantage. Therefore, Oscar's style, his creativity, the new shapes he conceived, have contributed to form our own vision of modernity, our modern Brazil. There is no doubt that Oscar, using Le Corbusier's work as a starting point, created his own language, which transformed modern architecture of the twentieth century. I am from Rio, from the beaches, the mountains... Rio has it all. Beautiful women stroll by, everyone enjoys. You fight when you have to. You suffer when you have to. You laugh a little... That's the way of the Carioca. I remember one day Le Corbusier telling me: "You've got Rio's mountains in your eyes." But that's not so, there's more. There are women too... No, my architecture is not what Le Corbusier said it was. It's more like something André Malraux used to say about having his own personal museum where he kept all he had seen and loved in his life. I always felt I was inhabited by someone more extreme than myself. This 'other person' is full of mischief. It is he who has the craziest ideas. Sometimes he wants to do things but I have to hold back. He is my driving force in architecture. He loves curves, women and the most fascinating things. I believe that is what life is all about. I'm an animal like any other, I've got a one track mind... Without women, life's not worth living. It's an unavoidable fact. Woman is man's companion, she is indispensable. She is the incarnation of humanity, the queen of mankind, she's fantastic. I often approach a project without touching a pencil or felt pen. I hold everything in my mind. I give free rein to my imagination to seek out solutions. Sometimes, the solutions come through drawing. The basis of architecture is drawing and reflection. In Algeria, I remember working on a mosque. I was at home, in bed. I could not sleep for thinking about it. I was thinking of the shape, of the columns. I got up and drew it. Here's how the mosque appeared to me. I did the columns like this, another like that, and another and so on. I thought it should stand by the sea, on the coast. The project took form without the use of a pencil, just by thinking. The mosque looked good. I remember when I showed the model to Boumédiene, the President of Algeria, he said to me: "Oscar, this mosque is revolutionary" and I answered: "There's no stopping a revolution." When I reach a solution, with well-defined sketches, I write a text. The text is an attempt to explain my architecture. If I cannot explain it, I go back to my drawing board because it means something is missing. It is when an idea springs forth that one perceives what architectural creativity is all about. It is the moment of satisfaction at having found the right solution, something different, something that can be built. That is the architect's dream. Drawing is a marvellous thing. When a child draws, it is always beautiful, because for him it is an act of freedom. A child has no preconceived ideas, only spontaneity. Freedom and drawing are fundamental in life. As the palace doors open, the crowds swarm into the gardens. Workers, women, young and old shake hands with the head of government, they embrace him to show their support... Juscelino was an optimist by nature and in his vision of the world, he was open to innovation, full of enthusiasm. He played an instrumental role in the intensification of Brazil's industrialisation. When he became President of the Republic, he immediately thought of Oscar for his partner to help him realize his crazy dream of building a new capital : Brasilia. Juscelino came to see me at home, we went to town together, that's where he said to me: "Listen I want to build a new capital, it will take up where Pampulha left off. I need you." That was his favourite work, he dreamed of building a new capital. He wanted the capital to be further inland to develop the heart of the country. It worked. It springs from the primal gesture of choosing a site or taking possession of it. Two main axes cross at right angles. In other words, the Sign of the Cross. Brasilia is not an utopia, but it is the expression of a different, more modern Brazil, which rejects its colonial past. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the geographical location of Brasilia is the way of the great Brazilian West. In a sense, has turned its back on Europe, and is embracing its American destiny. It is the 'Wild West'. The West. Each time I went to Brasilia by car, I would pass the time by watching the clouds. They suggest SO many unexpected things. At times, huge and mysterious cathedrals, then fearsome warriors, or Roman chariots cutting across the skies, or some strange monster carried off on mischievous winds... The captains leading the toughest, yet most pacific, Brazilian battle draw the layout for the pathways of life. Meanwhile, the heavy machines of this war open, conquer and harness the wide spaces. 25,000 horsepower will be produced by a power station 13 km from the city. In Brasilia, a lake will be formed that is larger than Guanabara Bay. Brasilia was quite an adventure ! When I first came to Brasilia, it seemed like the end of the world, so far from everything. There were no roads, nothing... and we had only three and a half years to build a capital city ! I didn't go to Brasilia with architects alone. I went there with four friends who had no specific jobs, they were all in dire straits and I felt this was the right time to help. In the beginning, there were no creature comforts. We lived with the workmen in rough dwellings. All we had was a bed and a chest. We worked in a hut with a tin roof. It was there that we designed all the palaces of Brasilia. Architects Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer. The first is in charge of town planning, the other, of architectural works. Both are technician-cum-artists, rightly admired the world over. They use lines, volumes, colours and space to compose the Brasilia symphony. Oscar contributed enormously to this vision and modernized the image of Brazil abroad. Never had contemporary architecture had the opportunity to build a work of such scope. Modern architectural achievements had always taken place within an existing framework. Now, suddenly an architect has been commissioned to construct the fundamental edifices, the major buildings of a new capital. On the Square of the Three Powers, in the presence of President Kubitschek, the public attends the laying of the first metallic structure. With each passing month, the panorama of Brasilia is transformed. The feverish pace of building speeds up, as the inhabitants move in. Classrooms are not fully equipped, yet lessons have already started, for culture cannot wait. One sturdy Brazilian inaugurates the maternity ward. Work does not stop at night. There is too much to be accomplished. We had no time. We would produce a drawing and the following day, Joachim Cardoso would start on the calculations. Building would start before structural calculations were completed. This was done as the works progressed. The main building is the Congress. It looks simple. In three lines, you get an idea of its architecture. When the structure was finished, the architecture was already there, but it had been hard going. I remember Cardosa calling one day to say: "Oscar, I've discovered the tangent to create the effect that the dome is hardly touching the ground." Then, despite the rush, we discussed the thickness of the slab. For instance, this slab is 40 cm thick, and here, it's two metres thick. The whole architectural concept of Brasilia was based on lightness. The National Congress boasts a surface area of over 40,000 m2. The whole site will be over 800 m in length. Over one thousand workmen are building the Congress. Mud, the whole city was covered in mud... Either that, or there was the heat and that end-of-the-world dust. It was like the Wild West: we were fighting to build a new capital. In those days, we dreamed of a city with a different society, all equal: workmen, engineers, architects. Brasilia spelled hope, a starting point for progress in Brazil, as Juscelino wanted it. For me, he was like a Renaissance Prince wanting to achieve great, magnificent deeds, nothing mediocre. I designed the columns for the Alvorado palace like this. I wanted a person to be able to stand under here and talk. I wanted to avoid intersecting supports so I provided for columns like this, repeating themselves. The columns increase the impression of space. When André Malraux came here, he courteously said to me, " After the Greek columns, these are the most beautiful". Brasilia was an emotional experience for me. A completely bare plateau with buildings... It seemed almost surreal. You entered a jungle made only of earth and marvellous buildings, with architecture unlike anything you'd ever seen. It was one of the rare moments where I felt as if we had not been colonised. Our architecture was becoming purely Brazilian. It no longer had anything to do with the Americans or the Europeans. It was we, the Brazilians, who were building our city, our capital. When I designed the cathedral, I didn't want the old style, based on darkness, reminding one of one's sins. I wanted something different. Access to the cathedral is through a dark corridor, so that when people walk into the nave, they feel the impact of the contrast with light. Their vision floats away into space. The idea was that the faithful, those who believe in God, may feel that here, they are communicating with infinity. When the structure is completed, I want it to be beautiful in its own right. I want the concrete work itself to be beautiful, to be a work of art. It was in this spirit of architectural grandeur that I designed all the works in Brasilia. Like a flower on this rough and solitary earth... A city erected within the solitude of a desert. Like a never-ending message of grace and poetry... Rumour has it that in the sun, the town dons a wedding dress in which architecture stands out in white, floating in the wide dark spaces of the high plateau... in an atmosphere of dignified monumentality... Lucio Costa would say that Brasilia's landscape was my architecture because there is not one single mound or hill in Brasilia, so that the people there see only the architecture. Leaving behind the image of a part anecdotal, part exotic tropical Brazil, the country is suddenly talking a modern language, that of the best architecture in the modern world. Those who built Brasilia, who came from all over thinking Brasilia would be the start of a new life left as poor as when they came. For as soon as Brasilia was inaugurated, the businessmen and politicians arrived. All those who are governing this country are representatives of capitalism with its trail of injustice. It is therefore up to the youth, inasmuch as they can, to overthrow the trend of ever-worsening conditions through revolution. I still believe that Brasilia is a phenomenon. It then epitomised a vision of Brazil that never came into being. It was not the fault of Brasilia, but of Brazil. What happened afterwards is social, economic and political collapse. We've known twenty years of military regime. Brazil's dream was spoilt not because the project was a bad one but because the history of Brazil did not match Oscar Niemeyer's dream, my generation's dream. The fault is not Brasilia's. The dictatorship in line with the cold war context, the conflict between East and West, between capitalism and socialism, was one of Brazil's most violent and bloody regimes ever. The presidents of Bolivia, Hugo Banzer, of Chili, Augusto Pinochet, of Uruguay, Juan Maria Bordaberry and Mrs Patricia Nixon representing the United States have come to greet President Geisel. The Church is represented by five cardinals. This regime caused the death of many people through imprisonment, torture, exile... The Brazilian intellectuals played an important part in it all because they never adhered to the regime. They fought it from beginning until its collapse. And Oscar was one of the main characters in the process. I have done twenty-odd sculptures, each one an expression of protest. This is a spear, with a man right here. I called it "Torture, never again." I made another sculpture in the honour of three workmen murdered by the military. On the day it was inaugurated, the police came and ruined it. We came back and suggested redoing the monument, leaving the scars. The workmen stood guard over it for three days. It survived ! The Party played an important part in my life. The most remarkable people I've met belonged to the Party. They were generous, they sacrificed themselves, many died. The last time I was summoned by the police, they took me into a room that had been padded for acoustic reasons. I then felt I could no longer stay in the country and fled to Europe. When I arrived in Paris, I started to design projects. Malraux managed to convince de Gaulle to pass a decree so that I could work in France as a French architect. I designed the headquarters of the Communist Party. I positioned the building like this. Then there was the problem of the large Working Class auditorium. If I had designed it at ground level, the dome would have been huge. So I buried it. The hall is underneath and the dome sitcks out like this, so it seems smaller when seen from above. I wanted to demonstrate something we tend to forget, that it is possible to achieve balance between volume and empty space. It was important to work in this way on the outside, it's a question of architectural beauty. My Party comrades in France were good people like those in Brazil, always involved in life, wanting to change the life of the poor. The world is made by the richest among men. Someone once said that the poor were against the rich. Today, the rich are against the poor. When I was in Europe, I had this political concern to show that we aren't gentle savages... We are quite clever in Latin America. We wanted to show that we could do anything, that civil engineering is more ambitious in Brazil. When I was working on the Mondadori building, I designed a colonnade which was far from banal. Each arch is of a different size. I did one of 15m, another of 3m, another of 5m... It has musicality. Next, I simply suspended the five floors from the beams. It is not the colonnade itself which is important. It is the fact that the space between the columns gives it proportion. We need this space, don't we? When you look at a landscape, both the trees and the spaces between them are important. I am far away from everything, from the things I love. From that beautiful land where I was born. One day I ran away, hit the road. Brazil is where I want to live. There's nothing for me here, I'm not meant to be here. My mind is made up, there's no stopping me. To hell with my work. To hell with this crappy world. Brazil is where I want to be. Everyone in his own home, playing with friends, watching time go by. I want to look at the stars, I want to feel life. Brazil is the place for me. Getting together with friends to relax and forget all my troubles, has become a daily habit, a must for my inner stability. Sometimes we plunge back into a distant, far away past when we were still leading a bohemian life. Old friends reappear: the Café Lamas, Conde Lages road and the man with the mandolin. My grandfather was minister of the Supreme Court. A very honest man. And honest he died, without a penny. His luxury was having mass at home. I remember as a child, they would kick me out of mass. When my grandmother started on the Ave Maria, I always had to laugh. I was brought up in a very religious environment. I know what priests talk about, and all their speeches about misery. I saw the huge lie it all was. Just step outside and see for yourself. I am a rebel... I rebel against injustice, misery. I believe in a better world, a realistic world, fully aware of how expendable we are. But it is possible to live and stick together, as decent, dignified people do. The Memorial was a project I thoroughly enjoyed doing. The Latin America Memorial was designed to unite the people, to encourage exchange, to carry out a series of artistic, cultural and political experiments. Latin America has suffered many attacks. She was invaded, despised. Today, these are important nations. They can get together and react against imperialism. I am much in favour of the struggle to unite the people of Latin America. Such is the purpose of the Memorial. It meant so much to me that I drew that hand with blood running down the wrist, to represent Latin America. Every time I was summoned by the political police, they would ask: "Is it true you praised Fidel Castro?" They thought Cuba was dangerous for Latin America. It was very satisfying to know that the name of Cuba is heard all over Latin America and that it still means the same thing: "the hope for a better world'". Fidel is the hero of Latin America. One evening he came to my office. We talked. I had invited some intellectuals to come and join us. He very much wants me to come to Cuba. He saw the model of the monument against the blockade. He wants a sculpture of it to place in front of the US Embassy. Dear friends... The last time I saw him was years ago, in Rio. And now, what surprises me most is that I find him looking younger than ever... What is our dearest wish? That Niemeyer be eternal... As we remember Michelangelo and other great painters, so we will remember him with the greatest admiration. Niemeyer will be eternal, through his work and his noble ideas. A lonely, rainy Sunday, alone in my office, tired of life, of this long succession of tears and laughter. I listen to some old songs and great sadness sweeps over me. The songs are about time, fear and old age. Old memories come back to me... My family, my dear parents, my beloved friends. I cannot help myself. I cry, quietly, softly, with tender nostalgia. I close my eyes and a strange calmness sweeps over me, as if we were going to be all together again. But here comes a new song, all of a sudden: it's good old Adolfo Alves singing. "Rip your smile from my path, let me by with my pain." It is not the ups and downs of life which bother me most. It is the tremendous suffering of the poor, facing the indifferent smile of man.
