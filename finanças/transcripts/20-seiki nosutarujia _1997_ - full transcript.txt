A DANOSARCHIVE EXCLUSIVE 0.1 00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,300 Unauthorized English Subtitles reinterpreted by Max T. 0.2 00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,100 Ryoko Hirosue 0.3 00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800 Tsutomu Enjima in a Masato Hara film 20th CENTURY NOSTALGIA Six meat&veggie buns, please. 3.2 00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,290 Just a minute. ANZU: Kaminarimon Gate, Asakusa District, Nakamise-dori Street. ANZU: After the war, it became a most visited tourist destination. ANZU: This is where Tokyo Edo Castle and other popular attractions are located. ANZU: Our school is not too far off so, even if you're not a tourist, ... ANZU: ... why don't you consider paying the Gate a visit? Oh no! My mother gave me the wrong lunchbox again! CHUNSE: Plan Number Eight. CHUNSE: Report from Planet Earth recorded by Chunse&Pōse. Now, what's that? Is this some kind of joke? CHUNSE: The Asakusa Report is of little consequence, Pōse. 14.2 00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,870 CHUNSE: Let's talk about something more important, instead. Hey, Toyama, what's going on--- CHUNSE: Let's examine Earthling's eating habits... 16.2 00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,700 CHUNSE: ... as opposed to our own. PŌSE: Our eating habits? What if I hardly remembered them? CHUNSE: Be careful now, Pōse. If you forget them now... 18.2 00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,060 CHUNSE: ... eventually you won't be able to remember them anymore. Anzu! PŌSE: Let's change subject, shall we? I really love this place. PŌSE: See how the humans arranged all the items. PŌSE: So neatly. CHUNSE: Everything is so carefully displayed, yet it all looks so natural. Hey, isn't that Kataoka's voice? Kataoka? Yes, that weirdo who studied at our school only for the first semester. He moved to Australia, didn't he? PŌSE: Being a male is so much better. CHUNSE: A male? CHUNSE: Cosmic beings originate from the same cell division, so... PŌSE: So being a male or not doesn't make much difference, is that what you mean? CHUNSE: That's exactly what I mean. CHUNSE: There's no real gender distinction, you see? PŌSE: Oh, that sounds quite monotonous. PŌSE: Chunse, if we were sexless organisms, as you say... PŌSE: ... then what would become of other related natural processes? PŌSE: What about falling in love, you know, like... PŌSE: ...you as a male... PŌSE: ...and me as a female? CHUNSE: Is a Love Story what you're talking about? CHUNSE: Well, do that and you'll end up destroying the Earth. PŌSE: Is that a fact? How do you know that? CHUNSE: I saw it in the Time Machine. CHUNSE: This is what is bound to happen to the human race. PŌSE: Come on, now: who will have time to worry about the end of the world... PŌSE: ...when they're busy finding a name for their newborn babies? CHUNSE: This is no joking matter. Kitamura-sensei, how can you just sit there and laugh like that? Aren't you supposed to be the head of the broadcasting department? PŌSE: To recap, love between a man and a woman is one of the main causes of the end of the world, and... PŌSE: ... as part and parcel of a love relationship, mutual affection is dangerous, too. CHUNSE: And that's only the half of it. PŌSE: All right, so let's make an experiment, shall we? PŌSE: Let's start investigating love between a man and a woman--- Hey! "Hey" what?! Why didn't you check the tape before airing it! It's all your fault! As a punishment, you must clean the clubroom for at least one week. Just let it go. The fault is mine. Hey, Anzu. Tell me something. Isn't this the movie you were making with Kataoka? Well, well... What kind of movie? There are so many tapes in here. Was it all made during the summer break? Yes. So this is what Kataoka was busy doing with his camera. Too bad you shot all these tapes without even bothering to edit them. But if I had edited the movie by myself... ... I wouldn't have been fair to Kataoka. Fair to him? Didn't he move to Australia by himself? All right, I give you my permission... ... to use the school's equiment and complete the movie. But what about the.. accident? Oh, today's broadcast accident... ... really drove the vice-principal mad. What a pity it would be if next year's budget got cut down. Come on, that can't be right! Don't worry, Anzu. If you need some help, I'm here. I guess this won't be easy for you. What do you mean? I mean, editing this film... ... will make you think of Kataoka, won't it? It's nothing like that. Oh, is that so? Tell me: did anything happen to him when he was still here? No, nothing happened to him. Then why did he leave... ... to Australia all alone? He had already planned to leave. But not like that. I mean, how is it that a boy and girl who seem to be getting on well... ... a nice, normal couple like many others... ... suddenly breaks up in the middle of the second semester? More to the point, how is digging up the past... ... not going to make you miss your Toru Takaoka? Why do you keep talking like that? 97 00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,140 Please, don't get mad at me. It's just that I want the project to be completed. You know, I really want to watch your movie. Hey! Cheer up a bit, will you? Which one looks better? Maybe this one. Pōse/Anzu's Earth Report NO. 9 This is a video letter from Anzu Toyama to Toru Kataoka. So, how are you? I'm doing just fine. Yesterday something quite serious happened. The video we were making together... ... was accidentally broadcast. Uhm... Editing the movie... Talking about Them... All right, take two. Kitamura-sensei thinks it's pretty good but it needs to be completed... ... and I'd like to edit it. Anyway, this is not only my work. It's our work. I think the time has come for the people of the Earth... ... to get to know "Chunse&Pōse". So, what is Chunse's opinion? Pōse is lonely. Chunse, will you answer me back? So, Pōse will work on the editing. Anzu will work on it, too. Anzu and Pōse are waiting for your reply. BYE BYE! Anzu! Why don't you knock on the door before coming in? Where's your friend from Outer Space? I haven't seen him around for a while. I've just recorded a video tape for him. I see. Could you please return these texts to the library for me? Ok. What are these books about? Something like... water treatment? That's right. Oh, the lamp. I'm sorry but you should make dinner yourself tonight. I'm going to be home very late. Will do. I still have a lot of soup left from yesterday. How do you like your new lotion? Not bad, I guess. Such a lovely gift, isn't it? I think so. Dad's so sweet. All right, I'm off. Do you remember grandma's favorite song... ... about how we should never forget... ... you know which song I'm talking about, don't you? Would you sing it for me while I put it on tape? All right, let's do it. Okay. Let's start with the hat. Ready? Go. Aren't you my schoolmate Anzu Toyama? What are you filming, if I may ask? Just a little camera practice. I'm transfer student Toru Kataoka, from senior high. Oh, I heard about you. You're the talented video artist. Did Hiroko tell you that? Did she also tell you I'm not right in the head? Oh, really? Why would she say something like that? Oh, well. I actually come from Outer Space. You don't look too startled. That's unusual. Yeah, I'm a Cosmic Being. I'm speaking through 17-year-old Earthling Toru Kataoka. 162.2 00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,710 But I actually come from Pollux Planetary System. CHUNSE SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE Let me translate it for you. "My name is Chunse." "I'm an investigator sent to planet Earth." I'm not used to talking about it to someone else. "Our mission." We're studying the cultural history of this planet. Wait, let me explain. Kataoka and Chunse have been as one for more than ten days. 169.2 00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,930 While Chunse is producing a report, Kataoka has seized the opportunity to make a sci-fi movie. But now, one last thing. Chunse would like to borrow your body. The event that would give birth to another Cosmic Being... ... should take place at any moment. You need to explain a little more. Should I lend my body to lay alien eggs? Is it something like in vitro fertilization? No, more like parthenogenesis. Do you remember our Biology class about binary fission in paramecia? But how are these organisms given birth to? What do they look like? They can't be seen by human eyes. Like transparent bodies? Have you received anything yet? I don't think so. Strange, it has already been sent, though. Just a second. Looks like I'm finally here. I am... The name is Pōse. Pōse. What is that? The Song Of The Universe! How does the time machine get started? 189.2 00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,820 Timewarp Mode: ON! How do cosmic beings differ from human beings? 190.2 00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,870 They are etheric, etheric, etheric bodies! 190.3 00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,770 Verse two, now. Pōse, take it from here! I'm so happy! I'm so happy I met Toru-kun! He is just like me! Kiyosu Bridge, where I first met Toru-kun. We shot a lovely scene over there. What if I started from here and kept editing smoothly until the end? Just do it patiently, and you'll be rewarded. I'm sure this movie will turn out a treat. For Chunse&Pōse. Just look at this! Don't you feel excited? This is Anzu/Pōse's Official First Earth Report. Our First Report together. How do you like it? Mmm, human food is pretty good. Their food and their building have basically the same shape. - Is Chunse happy, too? - Uh-huh. Chunse&Pōse, with Kataoka&Toyama... ... visited many different places together. It's safe to say that we embarked on a real adventure. I like the models in this shop. Earthlings speak many different languages. Their favourite means of transport is the bicycle. CHUNSE: Hey, let's go to Shizuoka! Yes, let's go to Shizuoka. Tell me one thing, Chunse: are you an asexual organism? To be precise, Chunse is a unisexual cosmic being. "Special Report from planet Earth." And after that, it will be Pōse's turn to conduct the survey. Cosmic beings feed on light and sound. Cosmic beings feed on light and sound. Is that what cosmic beings eat? Light and sound? This is beautiful! So beautiful. So tasty. Really delicious. Yummy. This is it: we made the grade as Earth Correspondents! We are examining and reporting many important details. Should this road be mentioned in the report? Timewarp Mode: ON! Wonderful! Wow, wow, it looks wonderful. Look at the microorganisms on these leaves, they look wonderful, too. Hey, let me see them! Give me some of your energy. Wait! Fast vehicles approaching! I'm starving. What's wrong, Toru-kun? 238.2 00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,250 I mean, Kataoka.. I mean, Chunse. When the etheric beings run out of gas, their human hosts have no strength, either. That's too bad! Pōse is hungry too, too bad! 242 00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,046 Too bad! Things would be much easier if we were born on Earth. Chunse, my cosmic belly is totally empty. That's too bad! Too bad, too bad! Chunse, what kind of image is that? It's a poster. Tonight they are showing this film. What is a film? According to Kataoka's explanation, films are something made of the stuff we feed on. The stuff we feed on? Films provide the same nourishment as that supplied by our regular meals. After all, we feed on light and sound, don't we? One more thing. You said there's no real gender distinction. Yet, the poster shows two Earthlings. Masculine and Feminine. Very well, let's go investigate. Oh no, the film has already started. Now that I think about it... ... my mother has a copy of this film at home. 259.2 00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800 Let's go watch it. Anzu's mother must be out. Kataoka is warning me that entering your home might be a bad idea. Don't worry, we're going to be fine. I'm back! Mom. What did I say about being out at night? Do you realize how late it is? That's why we came back home. Mom, please meet Toru Kataoka. Hello, I'm Kataoka. Toru, this is Yoshino, my mother. Pleased to meet you. I think I'd better leave now. Stay, I really want to watch it. 273.2 00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,780 I invited Toru over to watch "Breathless". Here it is, at last! It wasn't on the shelves as you said, but at the bottom of the cabinet. Fair enough. I can hardly remember the last time i watched it. Chunse, I think this film should be included in our Earth report. Hey, shall we watch it now? Coming! All right, here we are. Thank you. Here's the bottle opener for your juice. What a great film. Even though it was made more than thirty years ago, ... ... it doesn't look old at all. Hey Mom, did you fall asleep? She must have been very tired. This is not good. This is no place to sleep. It's bedtime for you! Please, help me prop her up. Ok, Mom. There's a good girl! Good night. Your mother was crying. The film must have brought back memories. Memories? That's the film she went to see with my father when they first met. They are separated now. Do you still see your father? Every now and then. That sounds a bit like my own family. My parents seldom see each other, but for another reason. Why? My father is an architect, he's often abroad. I think he's in Australia at the moment. Australia. Thanks. Is he living by himself? When I was a kid, we used to move from place to place, ... 310 00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,970 ... wandering around like nomads. Sweet. You must have some great memories. Only a few scattered ones. Can you speak any foreign language? Cosmic beings communicate telepathically, so spoken words don't really matter. Aboriginal people don't know how to communicate in foreign languages, either. Abo-what? Aborigines. Aborigines. They are Australia's indigenous people. By playing the didgeridoo and the drums... ... they can communicate directly to the heavens. That's what my father wrote me in a letter. What is a did-jee... Didgeridoo. Didgeridoo? It's a wind instrument, like a very big flute. Since I couldn't find one here, ... ... I made one myself. It's played like this. Hey, it's really late. Kataoka's mother will be very worried. Chunse, stay a little longer. I can't, Pōse. I'm afraid I'm wearing out this Earthling's body. I've been using it for quite some time. I'd better give it some rest. See you. Bye bye. What was he saying out there? Wait, I've got one more tape from that night. Here it is: "Anzu's home". It's about 34 Light-Years far away from the Earth. There's only one way for Chunse to make it back to Pollux. Our last hope is Australia. 346 00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,530 Is there even a story in here? I think this is more like a diary or something. It is possible that, after all the time spent living inside Anzu's body, ... ... Pōse had somewhat acquired some feminine sensitivity. So, what do you think of it? It's not a bad idea. I think Pōse's voice narration adds an interesting element to the story. Anyway, you should add it to the images yourself. I've got to go, now. When will you be back? Sorry. I'll be busy all week. I see. Hey, how much does a part-time houseboat cleaner make? The hourly wage is 1000 yen. Would you like to work with me, Anzu? Well, all these tapes don't come so cheap. Right. Then next time I'll let you know. It's a nice job. I'm off. Bye bye. Check this out, now. Rotation mode: ON. That's fun, Chunse. Yeah, why not? Here we are: two cosmic beings who travelled back in time... 00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380 ... to conduct an investigation about the planet Earth. Today we set off on a sightseeing tour. Earthlings seem to love doing group tours. How about us, do we like it or not? We will see. The tour-guide speech is kind of boring. So this Chunse's feedback, isn't it? Toru Kataoka here. I'm bored, too. How about you? I'm not too sure I like it. Anzu Toyama here. To be honest I'm quite bored, too. Here's our feedback for this section of Chunse&Pōse's report. A long shot of 20th century Tokyo. We're on the waterbus. Reporting from inland waters. This is Pōse. And this is Chunse. What's going on down here? Just filming, just filming. Why didn't Earthlings choose to live on water? They used to. Let's go over there. Hey, Pōse. Look at all those city lights twinkling in the distance... ... as bright and sparkling as star clusters. How can human eyes absorb all that brightness? Through their central nervous system. The brain receives visual information from the optical nerve. You're pretty bright yourself, Pōse. Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle. It seems that Anzu's neural circuitry have started functioning at full capacity. Now Anzu will use this energy to make me see something inside your memory. I've just seen such a beautiful scene. Like a bright night. I know what you mean. I saw that scene so many times. Anzu saw it because Earthlings now can investigate too at night. It's so bright out here. Kataoka has spent countless nights reporting about the lights. Wandering around town until 4 in the morning. Unable to sleep, like the City Itself. That's mad! That's mad indeed! Chunse, hold it. Chunse, let me peer into Kataoka's eyes to see if I can find any sparkle of madness. Can you see anything? I can, I can. Hold on, then: let's put it on tape. Nice shot. Let's get a little closer, so I can see better. I'll use the zoom remote control. Is it too heavy? It's fine. Let's fight! Come get me! Working like this is fun. Here's your tape back. Have some amazake. Cheers. What do you think of the movie so far? I'm really enjoying it. I have to say I'm satisfied with the editing. I like the relationship between the two characters. What a pity things ended up differently off-screen. Yeah. What happens after the last scene? Nothing you don't already know. He moved to Australia. I'm talking about Chunse and Pōse. What happens to them next? There is some more footage, but Toru-kun left it unedited. At last I've figured out what the Earthlings have created here. The largest and densest artificial forest of all time. A tower rising to the sky. Such a powerful visual image of the Earthlings' endeavours. The City That Never Sleeps. 440.2 00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,270 A city that never sleeps. A city ​​that doesn't sleep. A city that cannot sleep. All these flashing lights has turned night into day. Earthlings have lost their ability to achieve deep sleep. As a result, dreaming has become a desperate struggle. Things are not going to end well for the human race. Over the last months, our investigation had taken us to a great many places. Here we are now, back to the very same bridge, ... ... where everything started. Pōse, you did a very good job. Chunse, you did a very good job, too. Chunse would like to thank Toru Kataoka for letting me borrow his body... ... and his camera, as well. As for the result of the survey report, it speaks for itself. What does it say? That the Earth is bound to perish. 457 00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:49,723 That's that. I don't think that's the case. Anyway, Pōse begs to differ. It doesn't really matter, enough evidence has been collected. 460.2 00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,730 Besides, your assumption cannot be trusted anymore. Why so? Pōse, while you were assimilating information from the Earth, ... ... you ended up assimilated by the planet instead. That's why you cannot see what is going to happen. I'll leave at once for Australia and once there I'll continue with the report. What about me? Stay here and wait. As soon as I reach a conclusion, I'll be back to pick you up. 467.2 00:45:23,453 --> 00:45:25,453 Then we will finally go back to our galaxy. So, this is the end. The End. What kind of Love Story end like this?! It seems this kind of Love Story ended like that. Be that as it may... ... the ending of your movie is not satisfying... ... and by "your movie" I mean both "yours" and "his". But he quit..... I wonder why he behaved like that. Why did he leave for Australia? What was he thinking? Please, wait a moment. 479.2 00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,210 Give me a second. 479.2 00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,410 All right, be quick. Go, don't make him wait. Don't worry, he'll be fine. Finding an ending for your movie is what really counts right now. Kitamura-sensei will be so disappointed. You need to come up with a solution. As for the editing part, you can count on my help. Ok? Don't give up, Anzu! I can't get any ideas in my head. I know. But it would be a shame to waste all this effort. A real shame. Only not today. I'm too tired. I see. Then try harder tomorrow. Only don't quit, ok? Please, forgive me. No way. I waited for you for half an hour! And that's a wrap, as they say. Is it really over? Keep it. Put all the tapes away, please. 500.2 00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:18,859 I'll do the rest of the editing when I get back. When you get back ? Like I said, I'm going to Australia tomorrow. Tomorrow? The sooner, the better. So you really are leaving. But I'm very satisfied with our work here. May I take this back? When will you be back? To be honest, I don't know. But you have to come back. What I really have to do is leaving now. Chunse wasn't born on Earth. Getting along with anyone on this planet seems to be impossible. I don't think Chunse will be back. Pōse will be waiting. Anzu. What's going on? Do you mind if I interview you? Interview? You know, for a movie project. Thanks for letting me in. Is it a problem if I stay here tonight? Does your mother know you're here? I'll leave her a message. 524 00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:06,861 Speaking of Mom, later I'll ask her the same questions I'd like to ask you. Let's start with an easy one: what type of person do you like? What "type"? Your ideal type. I guess my ideal type... ... should be more or less the same as me. So your type is somebone who resembles yourself. A like-minded partner. "Like attracts like". Or does it? Pōse knows this is due to our origination from the same cell division. On the other hand, there's something Pōse has learnt from Anzu, as well. Some notions about the female side of human beings regardless of their gender. And perhaps some further notions about being one-sidedly in love, too. Now, what was that? Just notes to self for the movie's narration. Tell me, Dad. Do you ever think about Mom? I do. But when two people live apart from each other... ... they're going to forget their life together, aren't they? How could they forget? Anzu. Yes? Is there someone you like, by any chance? All I have is the movie I'm making. Just the movie, that's all! Lovely. Hey, Mom. Did you get the message I left for you? I stayed at Dad's overnight. To ask him questions. I'm doing some more research for my movie project. You know, whenever I mentioned you, ... ... he just kept smiling. Is that so? Anzu, are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I've got to go now. I'll be back home tonight. To listen carefully to what Toru-kun said... 559.2 00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,670 to watch closely what he saw... ... I had to get on our bus again. CHUNSE: How do Earthlings feel when they go to the beach? Is it a remainder of the earliest days of human evolution, ... ...back in the time when... ...from the waters of the Ocean, they moved among the trees of the Forest? They built an artifical forest that grew bigger and brighter. Their eagerness to move forward at all costs... 565.2 00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:17,247 ... their reluctance to give up control... ... will lead to their inevitable downfall... ... and eventually to the end of human civilization. Why does he think like this? 567.2 00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,389 Is human civilization really done for? And what do I think about all this? I'm not sure anymore. Longing for the Forest. Nostalgia for the Forest. Is speed all there is left? In the City, to ape the feeling of running in the woods... 573.2 00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:56,979 ... one has to keep running faster and faster, trying to reach the speed of light--- Speed ​​is the neurosis of the modern Earthling. City ​That Never Sleeps. A city ​​that never sleeps. A city ​​that doesn't sleep. A city that cannot sleep. All these flashing lights has turned night into day. Earthlings have lost their ability to achieve deep sleep. As a result, dreaming has become a desperate struggle. Things are not going to end well for the human race. I am ever so sorry. Why don't you try a little harder? I'm hopeless. What a waste. Toyama-san, I hope this won't happen again. Please, accept my apologies. Sensei, is there something wrong with Anzu? She abandoned her movie project. Hiroko, great news for you. According to the horoscope, this is going to be a great month for Virgo. What's that nonsense? Sakuragi News. "Love: this weekend the moon will be ruled by Merc--- What's going on? Why did you quit? The project was going nowhere, it was too difficult to... I don't care how difficult it is! What did you work so hard for? You spent the entire summer holidays shooting your project... ... but, since Kataoka has left, you're going to quit, too. You said you really want to edit your movie. This makes no sense. Look at this. All these tapes you put together. What are you going to do with them? Don't worry about that. This project was mainly Kataoka's idea, and I can't seem to complete it. No matter how hard I try, I just can't. Do you know what I mean? I don't, and I don't want to. Why shooting all this if you didn't want to finish it? If Kataoka was here--- Enough, now! Please, I don't want to talk about this movie anymore. I appreciate your support, but it's over, and I'm fine with that. Am I the only one who feels relieved that this project has been shelved? Yes, relieved. And if I don't have to care about it anymore, why should you? You heard what the horoscope said. Why don't you go out on a date? Don't worry about me. I'll be fine, I promise. Ah, okay, now I see what you mean. Just give up already! Who cares anyway, right? Did I break it? Let me check. It still works. I hope I didn't break any. What, now? You're quite short-tempered, aren't you? You're quite the quitter, aren't you? Turn it off! I'm ordering you to stop filming me! I was already making a video when you showed up in the background. And I ordered you to stop! Why? Am I hurting anyone? Yes, you are, you're hurting the City! You are stealing electrical power. Why don't you use your own? This is not your property. I ran out of energy. What? Fine, I'll pull the plug. 641.2 01:02:43,307 --> 01:02:44,307 I'm going to arrest you! I say shut it down! Shut it down! Electricity theft? Are you hungry? What would you like to eat? I have other thoughts in my head. Please, don't move your head too much or you'll be out of the frame. I haven't finished this scene yet. Don't forget your duty is to study... ... or else your father will scold you. How are you doing at the new school? You can talk to me if there is something bothering you. Mom, is this Tokyo? This is Tokyo, right? It's 2 am in Tokyo. It's 1 pm in New York. It's 2 pm in Rio de Janeiro. It's 11 pm in Calcutta. It's 8 pm in Istanbul--- Is this part of the movie? It was on the same tape. Would you like some iced tea? I guess Toru didn't contact you either, did he? He didn't. I'm so sorry he's making you worry. Don't worry. I don't know what to do with that kid. He left and went to Australia all alone. He hasn't called me for days. Is that so? His father says he's fine. He says Toru is probably busy with new friends or something. What is my kid doing? By the way, do you mind if I see Toru's room? Please, go ahead. Chunse's Earth Report. SPECIAL EDITION I've spent so many nights inside Yukio Kataoka's body... ... that he has almost become an integral part of me. What he let me see through his human eyes... ... associated with his thoughts... ... has given me the chance to appreciate and partially agree on Kataoka's theory. Toru Kataoka has no doubts about the future of the human race. We walked around the City together, thinking together. I got to learn from Toru Kataoka about what will happen on his planet. About how humanity will destroy itself. Toru Kataoka thinks there's nothing I can do to prevent it from happening. Only the Earthlings can rewrite their own ending. It all started long ago... 686.2 01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:33,351 ... when humanity chose to abandon the Forest. I saw that forest in my mind. A forest I don't want to leave. Soon enough, the Earthlings were living in unnaturally overbright places. A new kind of information began to be carried... 690.2 01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,499 ... through the synapses from neuron to neuron. The human population kept increasing in their artificial forests. Unfortunately, they lost touch with the real Forest. Synapse loss affected neural connectivity. 693.2 01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,820 While the lights of the City were taking over... 693.3 01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,320 ... old memories inexorably got lost. New thoughts arose to compete with the previous ones. 694.2 01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,939 New synapses replaced those lost. Traces of previous memories were to be found only in sleep. 695.2 01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,920 In dreams of the heavens. 695.3 01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,640 In dreams of the Earth. I hope the Earthlings can save their planet. But how can the Earth be saved by a species... ... that doesn't even know how to save itself? Yet, I believe... ... I want to believe... 699.2 01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:53,526 ... I need to believe... ... they still can make it. I need to take a rest. I'd like to go to sleep. I want to go home. But then again... ... where is home? Toru-kun. Chunse/Toru-kun. You told me your loneliness is so deep. Pōse is lonely, too. Pōse, whom you helped come to this world. Pōse, with whom you never talked about your true feelings. I didn't understand your suffering, Toru-kun. Toru-kun. Do you mind if I charge my camera here? My battery is dead. Still out shooting at this time of night? I don't have much time. You know, I was thinking about how to end our movie. Chunse assimilates Toru. Together, they become a new life form. Now the only one who can help Toru is Chunse. Too bad Chunse can't stand that wimp of an Earthling known as Toru. It's not like that! Toru always tries his best. So, what do you think of my idea? If only I had a didgeridoo with me. Indigenous Australians know about the power of the sound of the didgeridoo. Its natural radio waves would put the whole City to sleep. Yeah! What a powerful sound. Like this. Let Pōse join you. Toru-kun! Toru-kun! Take it easy now, please. I've got to go. Where do you have to go? Australia. What's wrong with you, Toru? I don't know what to do with you anymore! Here it is. The night scene. What was Toru saying to his camera that night? It's about 34 Light-Years far away from the Earth. There's only one way for Chunse to make it back to Pollux. Our last hope is Australia. Where is the tape we made that night? This isn't the right one. I need the tape from the night when I invited him over. This isn't the right one. Is this the one? Chunse, I think this film should be included in our Earth report. This is the one! Toru. There's nothing wrong with Pōse asking you to stay at Anzu's. Anzu Toyama is really a special girl. Hey, why are you smiling now? I think I know why. Because you like me a bit. I think I know another thing. 754.2 01:16:01,226 --> 01:16:03,328 I like you a bit, too. What a funny pair. All right, Anzu. Take care. Toru-kun. I finally know what to do with this movie. I'm going to add new scenes. But, since I don't know exactly which scenes I should add... ... I'll ask Pōse to be so kind and help me out one last time. Anzu Toyama, creature of the Earth. 761.2 01:17:44,025 --> 01:17:46,025 Female Human Being. I'm transfer student Toru Kataoka, from senior high. Pōse/Anzu's Earth Report. SPECIAL EDITION Topic: Anzu Toyama. The day she met Toru Kataoka... ... was also the day Pōse came to stay with her. From that day on, her life changed forever. At first she thought it was just fun. 769.2 01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:42,611 But as days passed by.... ... things between them became more meaningful. Because of Chunse's special relationship with Posu, ... ... Anzu and Toru developed a special relationship, too. They spent a lot of time together. I'm so thankful for that. Summer with Toru-kun was fun. Anyway, Anzu wasn't so commited to making the movie. Unlike Toru. Something Anzu didn't notice back then. ANZU: So, how are you? I'm doing just fine. ANZU: Yesterday something quite serious happened. When Toru suddenly left for Australia... ... Anzu felt betrayed and lost. In spite of all circumstances and concerns... ... eventually the movie has been completed. I wouldn't credit myself as the author, though. I'm more like the editor. ANZU: Anyway, this is not only my work. It's our work. ANZU: I think the time has come for the people of the Earth... 787.2 01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,392 ANZU: ... to get to know "Chunse&Pōse". When Toru decided all of a sudden to leave for Australia, Anzu couldn't forgive him. But eventually she understood why he had to go. He wanted to allow Anzu to think about her feelings. When her father and mother divorced, Anzu didn't cry. 792.2 01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:32,226. "What's the use of crying?", she told herself. But sometimes crying is a good thing. It helps your true feelings come out. ANZU: "Mom! That's not fair!" ANZU: "This is so good!" "I have to learn how to express my true feelings towards Toru". That's what Anzu realized at last. In order to show myself new things, ... ... today I took a walk to a new place. Is seeing those trees making me feel something new? Pōse, I feel like something has changed in me. What about you? Yes, Anzu: something has changed, but it's outside us. The Earth is not bound to perish anymore. That's what I've just found out. In a moment, Chunse will inform Toru Kataoka, too. The future has changed, at last! That's right, we made it! Long live the Earth! I want to make this planet my Home. Home sweet home. Dad, would you take a little video with me? Another interview? I thought we were finished. No, we are not finished. Hey Mom, I'm back. How are you doing? Anzu. Uh? Oh, I'm doing really well. May I borrow this? What for? Guess who's here. The piper's back. Really? What? What are you doing here? Chunse said it was time to come back. Chunse wants to remain on Earth, too. So this is how Chunse&Pōse's story ends. Chunse. Pōse has been waiting ages for you! I watched your video. You made a great job and I want to thank you. It's not finished yet. We need one last scene. Let's shoot it together. How about this as an epilogue? EXTERIOR. BEACH. DAY. One fine morning in the 21st century. Just at the break of dawn. Who is that funny pair on the beach? It's us, four years from today. There's a pram between them. Two twins are lying in the pram. We are reporting the birth of two Earthlings. We won't be back. We will stay here. How should we call the children? Chunse, and... Pōse.
