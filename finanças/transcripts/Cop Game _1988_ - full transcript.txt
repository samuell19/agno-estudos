Get a load of those jerk offs. Hey, the pool is not that way, guys. What the hell is going on, Lieutenant? Charlie? No, sir, it's us. What? Come in. Sit down. I already know everything. Then you understand the main problem. Yeah, the three men who were responsible for the massacre. Wearing Cobra Force uniforms. That's what I call overdoing it a little. Don't you think so, sir? Yes, overdoing it. Like a murderer leaving his signature on a corpse. Are there any leads? I'm in contact with Colonel Kasler. The massacre took place in his sector. Kasler... wasn't he involved in the Trammel case? Yeah, that's him. Oh, he's not the kind of guy who fools around. No. But this time he's rather uneasy. In fact, he's playing scared. Scared of what? Being the next victim. You know, there wasn't much love lost... between him and Shooman, the commander of Cobra Force. Why would Shooman wanna have Kasler killed? That's what we have to find out. But we have to be discreet about it. I read you. I need two men from your unit... two of your best. Men who know how to move without stepping on anyone's toes. Well, I think I have the right couple... Morgan and Hawk. I can personally guarantee they know how to move. Are they discreet? That's where my guarantee runs out. It doesn't matter. Situation has become so serious... that we can't let that stop us. You know these days of ours here in Saigon may be numbered. There's too many journalists snooping around. Americans, Europeans, all bursting for a scoop... and this could be the one they're looking for. American soldiers killing each other... for God knows what obscure reason. You know, our, our department would be lucky... to get through this... to say nothing of the repercussions when we get home. Now, I hope you understand the problem. Yeah, I read you perfectly. Good. Then get these indiscreet good movers of yours on the job... and do it right away. You looking for us, Skipper? Yeah, we got a problem... and don't call me that. Another deserter. I don't even pay attention... to 'em anymore. We've got more deserting than we've got staying. Well, there's no deserters involved this time. Oh, let me guess. Drugs. Murder, and don't smoke my cigars. Murder? Interesting, huh, partner? Yellow or white? White, four of them. Two MPs, a nurse and an army captain. His name was...uh, Watts. Sounds like we've got a mass murderer on the loose. Just had a briefing from General Morris. Says that we have to get in touch... with a certain Colonel Kasler... but be cool about it, will ya? This is where you find him. We'll be very discreet. And thanks for the cigar. Hey, this could be your last case, Morgan. The war is almost over... and remember we are the ones who are losing. So for once do me a personal favor, will you? Don't overdo it, okay? We won't disappoint you, Skipper. You'll be proud of us. Hold it right there. Department of Criminal Investigation. And what about the orangutan? He's my date. Congratulations, you make an adorable couple. Get out of my way. If I want any shit from you... I'II squeeze your head. You shouldn't have said that about the orangutan. Now you hurt his feelings. Gook cops... Shit! This war sucks more and more every day. Colonel Kasler? Yes. Morgan and Hawk, Criminal Investigation. Ah, I've been expecting you. Sergeant Ludge. Nice to meet you. Shall we go into my office? Why not? It's not a pretty picture. So you think they were only out... to get Captain Watts? Ludge, show him the photos. A Marine took them by the pool. They're kind of blurry. I can't make out anything here. Take a closer look. Don't you notice something special? Well, uniforms look kind of familiar. Cobra Force, Major Shooman's division. Shooman, Shooman, Shooman. Shooman's at Tan Binh... that's currently the most advanced division. That's right. They're the heroes who are making our evacuation possible. Do you mean to tell me three guys... from the Cobra Force came all the way here from the front... just to kill Captain Watts? I don't see why they would. I do... Would you like to let us in on it? I'm afraid I can't do that. What do you mean you can't? I told you it's not a pretty picture. We are talking military secrets here... and I am not at liberty to reveal anything. Cut the crap, Colonel. We're talking homicide here. All I can tell you is... there are two other officers whose lives are in danger... and I am one of them, which is why Sergeant Ludge is here. He's my personal body guard. Hey, Morgan. Yeah, what is it? You recognize this guy? How could I forget that face? Looks like he lost an acid fight. Yeah. You know that's the little fag that pushes... coke down at the Paradise Club. So what's the big deal? He's an enterprising little guy... who just so happens to moonlight as a hit man. Let's get him. We like to travel light... if you don't mind. Yeah, we'll be right back. Where did that little shit go? You guys seen a squid who's got a face... that could hold three days of steady rain? Who is it? His twin brother? Kasler's office. Hey! Shit! You all right? Yeah, it's nothing. Just a scratch. Where'd he go? There, goddammit! Let's nail that little prick. Go that way. Okay.

So you knew that little powderpuff. He was my pusher and I assure you he was no powderpuff. Oh yeah, right. So tell me, where do I find him? Down the hallway, room 11. Just act like you're underwater, don't breathe, don't move. Who the hell are you and what do you want with me? No, no, no, no. Let's get this straight. I ask the questions, you give the answers, okay? Whatever you say, man. Who are your other two buddies that helped you kill Watts? Listen, I haven't killed anybody yet. Turn around. Jesus, you're a big one. Aha. All seems to fit except one small detail. Don Study was transferred exactly... Three months ago. And two other soldiers were transferred to other companies with him. Corporal Neil Jones, Private Jim Stratton. Then their CO, Major Shooman had 'em transferred, insubordination, drug dealing, the heavy stuff. The inquiry is still open. Colonel, either tell us what's going on right now or we're gonna have to open up an inquiry of our own. Hey, our boss is just itching to hear from us, all we gotta make is one phone call. Now, who else is on that hit list besides you? I swore an oath and I'm not going to break it. Hey, Hawk, make that phone call. Wait a moment. All right. I'll tell you everything but I warn you it won't be easy to keep down. We can take it. The third officer is Lieutenant Pierce. Where is he? He's here in Saigon. I'm in contact with him. Good, good, good. Now, go on. Captain Watts, Lieutenant Pierce, and I were in the A Shau Valley about six months ago. While we were there, Shooman's Cobra Force veterans attacked a small village. Just women, children, and old people, scared and hungry. Shooman was convinced the village was a Viet Cong base. Charlie had blown away a lot of his men. I ordered him to evacuate that village. I mean, if it was really a Viet Cong base, he would've found tunnels, ammunition, weapons. But he didn't listen to me nor did his men. Shooman cut down all those defenseless people and Watts, Pierce, and I saw the massacre with our own eyes. It was like living a nightmare. Babies decapitated, women raped, Shooman's soldiers seemed to revel in that orgy of blood. They didn't stop until there was no one left alive. So why didn't you report Shooman and his men immediately? The war is over, my friend, and we're the ones who lost it. Shooman is a hero for all the GIs still in Vietnam, stateside he's also a hero, and let's not forget our last chance for a dignified retreat is closely linked with him and his men. Is that why the three of you made that oath? We were supposed to wait till the end of the war before reporting it. Well, you're right about one thing, my man. Certainly is not a pretty picture. Where is Pierce now? ♪ You live together ♪ ♪ One more dance with me it's in your hands ♪ ♪ They'll live forever ♪ ♪ And my dreams are still just you and me ♪ ♪ Just you and me ♪ What are we going to do about Skipper? We'll have to keep a tight Iip for the moment. We didn't make any oath. Uh, yes we did. And Kasler is right. You know we can't report Shooman right away. Oh, that's great. So we sit back and shut up while they stick Pierce and make another shot at Kasler? We just have to make sure that they don't. Fucking hell. That asshole Shooman slaughtered the children and passes himself up as a big hero? We can't let him get away with that. There's just something about this that doesn't gel. What do you mean? It couldn't be clearer. Cocksucker sends his boys out to eliminate all the witnesses to the massacre. And the witnesses clam up out of patriotism. You come from a country of assholes, partner.

I don't know what's stopping me from getting these two to blow your fucking heads off. Apart from being painful, it can be a little excessive. Excessive? I sent you two guys out to investigate a massacre, you put on another hundred of your own behind my back without letting me in on your private games. That's what I call excessive. We're just following a lead, Skipper. God sakes! How many times have I told you not to call me that? This isn't a goddamn yacht club! Okay, who are your latest victims? These two are ex-members of the Cobra Force. That's Lieutenant Pierce. Three servicemen dead and two ex-cops up on murder wraps. Boys, this time you really got your asses in a sling. You're gonna be court-martialed for this. Hey, wait a minute. We didn't kill Pierce, those two guys did. We're just acting in self defense. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, now I'm acting in self defense too. To protect myself from two crazy bastards like you. Either you tell me everything now or you're under arrest. We can't. You what? Well, we kind of made a deal with a high ranking officer. You two are coming with me right now. Hey, Ludge, lost your train, did you, fella? No thanks to you. Of course, I'm coming with you. Why didn't you tell me before? Hell, Colonel, we're here to protect you, too, you know. Well, if it comes to that, your men seem more efficient than mine. I'm afraid I'll have to inform General Morris about this. It's unthinkable that we blow the whistle on Shooman at such a critical moment. Sorry, but I just can't take that responsibility. I see. All right. Get General Morris on the phone for me. I wanna tell him myself. Hey, this is Captain Kirk speaking. I wanna talk to the General. Thank you. Hello, sir. I'm here with Colonel Kasler who has something to tell you. Yeah. Hello, General, it's me. Just a moment please. Gentlemen? Sure, Colonel. Let's go. Hello, General, I have to tell you something. This time you've really done it, boys. I can't cover for you either. You know General Morris is what you might call a touchy kind of guy. I can already guess his reaction. Ludge? Yes, sir. Send Morgan in. General Morris wants to talk to you. Morgan here. I only know you by your reputation, Morgan, and though we've never met I'm sure of one thing, you're a good policeman. Therefore, I'm sure you know how to keep a secret. I have a job for you that you mustn't talk about with anyone, it's strictly confidential. I want you and your partner Hawk to go to the front to the Muoi Thap Plain where the Shooman contingency is currently situated. I want you to make contact with him and bring him back here to me. Now, this is of the utmost importance. Is that clear, Morgan? Good. Ongoing commitment of US military forces... on the ground and in the air negates a rumored withdrawal of our troops from the battle grounds of South Vietnam. Intensive air support by helicopters of the Sixth Division is covering a strategic regrouping using daily strikes against the now substantially disbanded North Vietnamese army. 5,000 Viet Cong dead have been counted in the Muoi Thap Plain alone and casualties are reputed to be 10 times that figure. The con... It's bullshit. All bullshit, this war is over. It's finished. Where are you taking them? Right into Charlie's hands. They're replacing some of our boys who are going home. They're just kids. Yeah, but they just couldn't wait to see some action. Pretty dumb, huh? They don't realize they're just cannon fodder. When you're back home, you will forget all about me, but I will still be here, drowning in a sea of shit. What's wrong? They should be here already. Who? Die, you bastards! Let's get the hell outta here. Hey, hey, easy boys, we're the Department of Criminal Inve... I've got an appointment with General Morris. Yes, sir. The General is expecting you. Oh, Kirk, come in, take a seat. Looks like you're packing up to leave. Oh, they're changing offices. This one is no longer safe. General, I'm leaving on a mission by myself. I'll be back tomorrow, but I'd feel much better if you could clear up something for me first, something rather important to me. Cigar? No thanks. By any chance have I neglected my duty? Have I done anything wrong lately to make you doubt my ability? What are you saying? You're one of my best officers. Action to the point of the contrary of what you're saying, sir. I don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about Morgan, Hawk, they both disappeared. I only found out 'cause somebody talked who shouldn't have that they're presently headed for the Muoi Thap Plain where Colonel Shooman's division is. So if I wasn't informed of their mission, there can only be one reason: you don't trust me. All right, Kirk, you might as well know. Have you ever heard of the Vladimir file? Vladimir... Oh, yeah, of course. Mysterious Russian spy who was supposed to have infiltrated our army. That's an old story. It was going around a couple of years ago but turned out to be a sort of a joke. It was no joke. What harm could Vladimir have done in the past two years? We're losing the war because of the press and the international pressure. You don't mean to tell me that Vladimir has something to do with it too? Vladimir was and is the biggest heroin dealer in Vietnam. He's responsible for the corruption and death of a number of American officers including Pierce and Watts. So if Morgan and Hawk are going to get Shooman that means that you suspect Vladimir and Shooman of being the same person. That's one of the hypotheses. So why did Kasler feed Morgan and Hawk that story about a, about a massacre in Viet Cong village. It was a lie. We can't talk freely about Russian agents in times like this. What threat does Vladimir represent today? He represents tremendous threat. Well, he's picked up enough information about our armed forces, our weapons, our CIA spy network in Southeast Asia to leave the KGB with nothing to do for the next 10 years. He's done the work of a hundred KGB agents rolled into one. Sounds like a pretty wild story to me. You're saying Shooman is a KGB agent out on the front countering Viet Cong attacks, it's like science fiction. The Shooman, Vladimir idea is just one of the hypotheses. Personally I don't buy it. Then who? Kasler suspects Shooman. Shooman suspects... Kasler? That's impossible. They tried to kill him, too. And he escaped with only a flesh wound in the shoulder. He could easily have staged the whole thing. Well, if that's the case then you're in great danger, General. Don't worry about me. I've taken special precautions. In any case, I don't believe Kasler is Vladimir either. How do you know, sir? I've made a thorough check of both their files, I've information from the Pentagon. Neither of them has any ties in the past that could even remotely have anything to do with Soviet counterintelligence. It could be more recent, like two years ago when Vladimir's story first came up. No, Vladimir is a Russian agent, flesh and blood. He's from the KGB. He's extremely intelligent. He knows how to get people to do exactly what he wants. He's got an ironclad cover and a network of agents set up to back up his retreat. Now, in any case when I've got Shooman here, I'm going to confront him with Kasler. If either of them know the truth, I'll be sure to find out. Now, Captain, you know as much as I do. We'll talk again tomorrow when you get back, but I'll call you, I won't be in this office any longer, okay? Thank you, sir. Good luck. Welcome aboard my chopper. Just who the fuck are you? I am Major Shooman. Yeah, I'm the guy you're looking for. Where the hell are we? You are guests of the Cobra Force. And right now you're participating in a bombing mission. Our objective, a village crawling with Charlies. Since when exactly do we got to do with your bombing mission? Not much but you're here just the same. But right now I don't have any time for interrogations, I got a tight schedule around here. Walter One calling Swan, approach altitude 200 feet, target area two miles away, standby. Well then, what are two police officers doing at the ass of Vietnam with things the way they are? You better talk to me, Morgan! You're suspected of killing two American officers and making an attempt on Colonel Kasler's life. Did you say Kasler? Yeah. What are the names of the two officers I'm supposed to have killed? Quick, man! We don't have any time for this. Watts and Pierce. Watts and Pierce, how cute. Who is your commanding officer? Captain Kirk and General Morris. I know General Morris pretty well. We're over target, sir. We'll finish this little discussion later. Now it's time to make war. Okay, listen up, boys. Walter One calling Swan. Drop altitude, drop to 50 feet, over. Walter One to Four and Five, drop at three. Walter One to One and Two, bank left and wait. Roger One, Walter Four dropping at three. All the evidence we've collected points to you. You wiped out an entire village for no reason. And Kasler, Pierce, and Watts were there to see you do it. They kept it to themselves 'cause you're supposed to be a big golden boy. So you take advantage of that and have them eliminated. What? Were you afraid that they would talk after the war and tarnish your shining career? What the fuck is going on? That's horse shit. Watts and Pierce were just a couple of desk jockeys, experts on paperwork and that's all. They have never seen any action. Hey look, nobody... Wait. Walter One, okay, let's do this one more time. Okay. Listen up, back to base, boys. Mission accomplished. Nice job. I don't know why, but I think I've taken kind of a shine to you pigs. Geez. I know the truth, but I'm in no mood to tell you right now. But I can tell you one thing, Watts and Pierce were working for me. What about those three Cobra Force gonzos? Oh, the assholes sold out. Okay. The three of us are going to visit General Morris together tomorrow. I trust you. Morgan. It's nothing. I'll tell you what, I'll have my doctor patch you up. I'll go with your friend to Saigon. Everything's ready, sir. There's a car waiting downstairs. Good, I'll be right there. What happened? I don't know. Maybe it's a breakdown. Wait here, sir. Let's go. We're under attack. You two go that way. You two come with me. Hurry up, you two. Get General Morris out of the building through the rear exit. I'll try to stop them. I better call for reinforcements. It's too late for that, sir. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Shit, it's not him. Don't worry, General, go for the car. We'll stop them. We're perfectly on schedule. The appointment with General Morris is in exactly two hours. Good. Target car just passed this way. Proceeding west with no escort, Falcon Six, over. Stand by. Roger, Falcon Six standing by, over and out. Falcon One, report. Target car in sight passing primary hit mark, speed five zero. Okay. Come on, come on, move. It's a trap. It all seems so pointless now, Morgan. Saigon's about to be evacuated, all the witnesses are dead, nobody cares about this business anymore. Take my advice, get out while you still have time. Sorry, Skipper, but I'm staying here. Don't be a fool. Look, there's a chopper leaving in a couple of hours. Try to be on it. You go ahead, I'II catch up to you. US military presence in South Vietnam... is in its last days. North Vietnamese army units have decided advancing towards Saigon and are reported to be less than five miles from the city. All US military personnel are under orders to evacuate the country within the next 24 hours. Helicopter shuttle service is functioning from Saigon Airport to US Navy ships flying off the coast. All US military personnel and US civilians not out of the country by 0600 hours on next Tuesday will no longer be under the protection of the US government. Going somewhere? And you? Sticking around here is fast becoming a health hazard. Why'd you have him killed? What are you talking about? The hit man. The ex Cobra Force veteran, the man in room 11, now talk to me. He killed my man. Oh, bullshit, honey. Tao was an out-and-out fag and you've never done drugs your whole life. What do you want from me? Why don't you just get outta Saigon while you've got a chance like anybody else with an ounce of sense? He was about to go over to the other side, right? He wanted more money, started to get a little greedy so you thought, well, maybe the best way to get rid of him was have a cop kill him. I've gotta go. If you want to stay here, be my guest. of second lieutenant. Assignment to Logistic Services from 1972 to present day. Two years as Colonel Kasler's private secretary. Just so happens you're also a KGB agent. Am I right about that? Sure, just call me Natasha. Shooman had Pierce and Watts check into Kasler's past. Thought he might be a Russian agent. I found your file in Watts' office. You're the ones that had him killed and you murdered my friend. You're outta your mind. I'm gonna blow a fucking hole in your head, barbie doll. You wouldn't dare. Get up. You make a phone call. You tell Kasler your gonna go to his office in 30 minutes. Make a call now. You got three seconds to decide or I'm gonna mess up your hairdo real bad. Hold it right there, slick. Go back to your friend. What the hell do you think you're doing, Morgan? Three of us are just gonna stay here and wait for Kirk and some of my associates to arrive. Now, wont that be cozy? I got him to delay his departure, but not to worry we won't wait long. What the hell is going on here? Annie, what are you doing here? He thinks we're Russian spies. That's a heavy accusation. You got any proof? Well, yeah. How about these documents right here, Huh? The proof that Pierce and Watts nearly had for Shooman. Your naivety amazes me. Did you think it would be that easy to nail me? Let's just wait for the court martial for the finer details, shall we? I'll be happy once I hand you over to Kirk. Captain Kirk won't be coming, cop. He was blown away with his men 10 minutes ago. This decidedly isn't your lucky day. If you'd have left when you should have, you would've gotten outta here in one piece. What can I say? Timing is everything. Enough of this. Ludge, kill him. No, not here. Get him out of here. I don't want his body recognized. It shouldn't be too difficult with all the bombs falling on Saigon these days. Just who are you, sweetheart? Sorry, hotshot. I guess you'll just have to die wondering. Move! Why all these precautions? Once he's dead everything will be fixed. Tomorrow we'll go to Moscow. Not exactly. Tomorrow I go to Moscow alone. What? The word is out that you're not such a good agent, that you've made too many mistakes... that you nearly blew everything. But I always did everything you told me. If anyone made any mistakes around here it was you. Sorry, darling, but that's life. Sometimes the innocent... pay for the guilty. Hey, guys, you know you really don't have to do this. Shut up and walk. Can I say one thing? Go ahead, after all it'll be... one of the last things you'll say. Well, you know, at the hospital they said... I was a quick healer. So quick in fact that I really don't need this. So why do you wear it? Guess. You know, you're so resourceful... so full of surprises, it's almost a pity to kill you. Just who, what are you? Natalia Kolova, born in Minsk... but also a political science student... of Georgetown University, Washington DC. That's where I met Kasler. You're no nuclear scientist... but I think you can figure the rest out for yourself. You know, I really shouldn't admit this... but killing capitalists gives me a strange thrill. Babe, whatever gets you off. So long, police boy. He wanted me to give this to you before you left. “So long, cowboy. Say hello to America. From me...
