[toddler speaking indistinctly] [woman] That's what you want? [toddler babbles] What happens when I hold you, Jenna? What happens when you ask me to hold you again? I have to kiss you! [grunting playfully] [giggles] [laughing] [squealing] [woman] ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ ♪ Mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant ♪ ♪ So tender and mild ♪ [fading] ♪ Sleep in heavenly ♪ ♪ Peace ♪ [clock ticking] [overlapping clocks ticking] [ticking continues] [ticking stops] [woman 1] He's got a white face mask on, black on black, he's got a... [woman 2] Black-on-black coat or black-on-black shirt? [woman 1] Black-on-black coat. [man 1] Someone is down by Best Buy Mobile. You need to get an ambulance... [man 2] They're already being dispatched. [Sawyer] Another shooting, another safe part of American life shattered by violence. [male reporter 1] The gunman was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. [male reporter 2] Police say the killer made a beeline from his car in the parking lot through Macy's. By the time he got to the food court, he was already firing. [male reporter 3] Killing 54-year-old hospice nurse Cindy Ann Yuille, who was Christmas shopping, and 45-year-old Steven Forsyth, a father of two who ran a business in the mall. It appeared that the suspect's rifle did jam while he was attacking individuals in the food court. [male reporter 4] Police say he bolted down a flight of stairs, got his rifle working again, and killed himself near J.C. Penney's. Today, everyone agreed it was a miracle only two people were killed. So this is my mom's typewriter. She used this in college and kept it all these years and, you know, took really good care of it. And I used to play with it when I was a kid. These are just two hiking books that she loaned me. I plan to do a lot of hiking this summer, and... I don't know, I like having them here. They definitely... It's a little piece of her. This painting... I didn't realize, actually, how many little things around here kind of remind me of her. It makes me sad just going through this stuff, but... yeah, it's past tense, because she's... You know, she's gone, she's dead now. But, um... [chuckles softly] but, yeah, I don't know, I think of her as being here and like... And alive and... I don't know. [chuckles] I'm fine. [laughs] And I saved a couple of these from the memorial. I said, "I've been told before that no matter what happens", no one can replace your mother." [sniffles] "But it wasn't until now that I fully understand what that means." I said, "I have realized that inevitably", "somehow, this will change me. How exactly, I'm not quite sure yet." I hate crying about this. [sniffles] But I said... that wasn't part of the speech. [chuckles] And I said... I said, "I certainly was not ready "to lose her, but I am honored "to be the daughter of such an incredible woman, and I will never forget who she taught me to be." I found out about the shooting actually reading updates on Twitter as things were coming in, and I called my mom. Didn't hear an answer from her, which was typical. Called the house and talked with my stepdad, Robert. He also said he hadn't heard from her, but that she had gone shopping. So I knew she would be at Clackamas, but I just figured that stuff never happens to your family. [man] Well, let's see. We have so much. Yeah, where do you start? We took lots of pictures. We did a lot. We traveled a lot. We played a lot. Hiked, hiked, hiked. Oh, Lake Quinault. That was fun. Oh, Fiji. Fiji was good. And then Essex, Montana. That was even a better time. - [chuckles] - Snow camping. [laughs] There she is. Goddamn, we had a good time. [chuckles softly] I was working in my shed in the back. She popped in, and she said, "Well, I'm getting ready to go shopping for Christmas." [inhales deeply] And we... We said goodbye. As we always... we always... It was a good goodbye. It was an exceptionally good goodbye. You know, I remember saying, "Oh, wait a minute, sweetheart, I got something I want you to do." And then I go, "Oh, Jesus, Can't think of what it is." But anyway, so go ahead and go. I'll think of it." And it was a simple thing, like just taking the plastic in to be recycled, but I always think, like, if I could've remembered... Remembered that, and it would have slowed her down by a couple of minutes. She wouldn't have been standing where she was. Different... Would've been different. Everything would've been different. But... Yeah. What are you gonna do? [sniffles] - [male host] Senator Ginny Burdick, good morning. - [Sen. Burdick] Good morning. [female host] Ginny, you're working on a gun control bill that would expand Oregon's background checks to include sales between private individuals. Correct, we already have it for gun shows, which many states don't, and, actually, that was my initiative that got that in place. [female host] What's your support for the bill? Very strong support from the gun-owning community, from law enforcement. There's... I mean, some polling shows over 90% support for it. The other main bill that I have would ban all guns from schools unless school districts wanted to have people carry guns in schools. Right now the law says you can't carry a gun into a school, but there's an exemption for concealed handgun license holders. [female host] You have been working on this for so long. You have such a history in trying to actually reduce the amount of gun violence in our society. What keeps me going is I know the public is with me. And what happened after Sandy Hook and after Clackamas is the public now... They've been there all along. They're now speaking up. Gun owners are speaking up. Most gun owners are perfectly fine with anything I'm trying to do, but that extreme fringe makes life very, very unpleasant for people. [marching band drumming] [female reporter 1] Gun advocates gathered at the Oregon State Capitol today. [female reporter 2] People came out in support of gun rights. [male reporter 1] Called a patriot rally, they say no to new regulations, like the ones being considered this session, including a ban on big ammo magazines and assault-style rifles. [woman] All right, this really stinks, being the shortest one working here. Oka... there you go. All right, so... what's gonna happen if those guys in there don't listen to us? We're gonna have a lot of laws that really stink. [scattered applause] [man] I want to say to these people over here, who are you to stand up against the law of the land? What part of "shall not be infringed" don't you understand? [man] And we need to get rid of laws over there at the capitol. [man] Anytime you have some of these high-profile events, Sandy Hook or a Clackamas Town Center, everybody's making a big deal about the gun control and take guns away from everybody and... You know, and let's limit magazine size, which, that's... that's not going to solve any issues. If those were 10-round magazines, I would've had 50 rounds in... That I could shoot off in less than probably two minutes. We need to get rid of the misrepresentation that the American gun owner is some hick that's sitting in the back woods. We're vegan. We're alternative lifestyle and everything like that, but we're definitely for our freedoms and our rights. As soon as he is mentally able to comprehend what a firearm is and what it does... You know, physically, I know he'd be more than able to pretty much now... With the sheer intelligence that he has... he's almost 2... I'm sure he'll be able to grasp the adult situation of it by... By 4. [man] When they collapse the economy, they don't want people being able to defend themselves, so... - [interviewer] Who's "they"? - [man] The globalists. The elitists. They run things. They're the ones pulling the strings. [crowd] Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. [cheers and applause] [man] Why do I want to speak? I have a lot to say, and I've never really said it in front of a large group of people before, so I figured why not? We're all smart enough here to know that where's more gun control, there is more crime. [woman] Even though I'm not big on the whole, oh, I need to go have some big old assault rifle. If I want one, I have the right to have one. There you go, hon. I saw a couple pictures on Facebook. It had, like, Washington and Jefferson, and it says, "Hey, stop. We want our country back." And, you know, I... I honestly think if they knew what was happening, they would just... they'd say, "Okay, Revolutionary War all over again, guys. We fought this once. Let's do it again." [marching band drumming] Protect your Second Amendment! [man] You want our guns? Come and get 'em! [light applause] Within 24 hours, I had gotten online and contacted Mayors Against Illegal Guns. I sent emails to Brady. So within two days of Steve being shot, I was... I was already engaged. I've been a gun owner most of my life and, I mean, reasonably intelligent, but I... I just was trying to understand why these shootings occur, what motivates these people, why they choose these particular weapons, et cetera. And then understanding laws, and that was baffling to me, how screwed up our laws are across the country. The fact that it was an assault weapon really got me angry. And as I was reading about stuff, I was just getting, you know, a little... More and more angry about it and upset about it. And the more I learned about the circumstances of how the guy got his gun and what the Oregon laws were, it was just getting me incensed. - Jeff Barker. - Paul Kemp, nice to meet you. The reason I'm here, my brother-in-law was one of the shooting victims at the Clackamas Town Center in December. I've gotten very involved in efforts to try to curb gun violence. I'm a registered Republican I own a gun. I've hunted. Not gonna change any of that. I just rec... A week before Steve was shot, I went and bought my son his first rifle. Being an ex-serviceman and a police officer, you may have a concealed weapons permit. I don't, but I store my guns with trigger locks, and the ammunition is separate. I'm a retired cop. I don't need a... - Oh, you may not, okay. - But I... all... Right as we speak, all my guns are locked - in a safe at home. - Yeah. Well, this AR-15 that was stolen was not. It was just sitting out. I took a trip back to D.C. in February and got a chance to meet a lot of the other folks from... Who had lost children at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois and University of Arizona and Sandy Hook and Aurora, Colorado, and Columbine, and it is simply not the laws themselves. I mean, there's mental health issues. - Huge, yeah. - Yeah. And there's other... Other things. But what... what seemed to me a major part of it was, you know, the simple availability of the weapons. Hopefully, you know, there's a way to find some support from you on some of the measures that are gonna come through and button up some of the laws. In general, I'm not in favor of a lot of new laws because we're not enforcing the ones we have, but I'm willing to look at anything. Thank you. I'm really sorry for your loss. - I mean, what can you say? - Right. Yeah, there's... - And I can't imagine. - Yeah, well. - I appreciate your time. - You bet, and anytime. And you know, anytime, holler and we'll get you in. - Okay, thanks very much. - Be glad to talk. Okay. [Paul] Probably it's typical with most politicians. You know, they're somewhat guarded in their comments and what they'll offer support to. But it would be more encouraging to hear some just outright support. [bird chirping] [Stephen King] In the '70s, the late '70s, I wrote a book called Rage, which was about a school shooter who shoots his algebra teacher, holds his class hostage for a day. And that was found, actually, in the locker of one school shooter, I think, in Oregon. So I made the decision to withdraw the book from publication. When you find out that you wrote something that's been associated with acts of violence, there are a couple of ways that you can go. One way is to say, "I had no responsibility for that. "I just wrote a book. I didn't have anything to do with the shooting." Or you can say, "Yeah, okay, I might have had some sort of influence on this." The question that you have to ask is, does this disturbed individual have access, easy access to a weapon to work out his fantasies with, his... his killing fantasies? My idea when I wrote Guns was, let's make it very, very difficult for people to get automatic and semi-automatic weapons. I mean, obviously, if we could stop killer tornadoes, we would. But somehow, we're just sort of supposed to accept the idea that some guy with an AR-15 can go into your mall and light up the food court. [indistinct conversations, streetcar bell clangs] - Nice to meet you. - Paul, glad to meet you. - Hi. I'm Jenna. - Paul. [Paul] You know, one of the first questions I had... Was that gun purchased legally? Was the gun dealer legal selling it? And does Oregon have a safe-storage gun law? I mean, can the guy who owned... Had the gun stolen from him, - can he be prosecuted? - [Jenna] I don't think so. Or can he be civilly charged? No, he can't. Oregon has no safe-storage gun law. I don't know how much of a deterrent that is gonna be. But none of these things will solve all of the problem. - [Robert] No. - But incrementally, it will reduce the number of occurrences. Right, there's a way we can discuss this with rational people and prudent people, you know? The gun-rights people aren't the criminals. They're the people who are just concerned about losing their rights. We can ensure that they keep their rights and still be able to control the weapons that are out there - to a degree. - [Paul] To a degree. And honest, it's not a failproof thing, but certainly, it will help a lot. It would've helped in our situation. Yeah, the whole thing might not have happened. [Robert] Exactly. The sheriffs are requiring their deputies to lock up their guns. What does that tell you? This isn't something unreasonable. I mean, personally, I've just kept a baseball bat under my bed. - That's what I've always done. - [Robert] Right. Exactly. And I'm not sure how good that is, 'cause I'm a lousy baseball player. I guess the thing today that struck me, you would think that some of these folks would be kind of outraged at what's happening. The Clackamas Center, our own backyard, and then... the slaughter of 20 first-graders and their teachers. If that doesn't... I don't understand why that doesn't outrage people. Everybody, thank you for coming today! We're trying to figure out an official name for what we're doing. Tie in, like, defenders of the republic, defenders of the Constitution, the founding fathers, Valley Forge, fighting, republic. For a logo we could have a cross... crossed feather, you know, with an inkwell there, a crossed feather and an inkwell and a... A musket and the FF crossed like that. - [man] I like that idea. - [Michelle] Right now, I wouldn't be too concerned about a logo, because we are under such a time crunch because of what's been thrown at us. I like revolutionary. [man] I like the Oregon Heritage Defenders. It's short, simple, to the point. People will read the title, and they'll get what it is. Doesn't say anything about firearms. - [man] Right. - But where we lack guns in the name, - we can have it in the symbol. - You don't think a symbol is strong. Think about this symbol, that's very strong. He was a genius... Every time I look at the Third Reich, I think of the genius - of the symbolism of it. - All right, you know what? How about if we just table the name for right now and move on to more important business? [man] Can I say one thing? We need to get away from that messenger dog and messenger pigeon, get away from this... [Michelle] We talked about that, actually. That's what you're going to have to do, you have to. Get away from that Internet because they control it. These rallies are Second Amendment rallies. They are, you know, gun rallies, but the overall big picture is you take away the Second Amendment, you're gonna take away your First Amendment, your Fourth Amendment, and the rest of the Constitution isn't gonna be there, and that's what they're trying to do. We've always, always had guns. When I was little, my grandma had a.357 sitting by the bed. We shoot with them. My husband and my son go hunting. I keep it for safety, personal safety. See, Jake is the first line of defense. If they get past that and then they see the sign... And if then they get past that, then the door's locked, and then if they get past that, then there's me with a gun. So I figure I've got four steps of home security. And they're free, so I don't have to pay a monthly fee or anything. [laughs] Just dog food and bullets. [Jake barking] The lady that lived over there, I was walking one of the dogs, and she says, "Why do you wear a gun? What are you scared of?" And I said, "Nothing." If I took it off, I would be. [laughs] [Jake barking] [birds chirping] This is a Mossberg 715T. It's a.22 on an AR platform. It accepts detachable magazines right here. It... it's got the rails, which... All that's for is to, you know, mount attachments, like this foregrip here, which... All the foregrip is for is to... You know, firearm stability, you know, keep it more stable. This is a flashlight laser. You know, it's dark, whatever, you need to see, you turn on the flashlight. This is a scope. It's to see farther, to shoot farther. The adjustable butt stock, you just adjust it for your arm length. It's another thing that gives you better control of the gun, same with the pistol grip. A lot of people are scared of the pistol grip, but all that does is just give you more control of the firearm, too. Just 'cause you have a pistol grip doesn't mean you can go and kill more people faster, you know? They see somebody go into a school or a mall with a gun that has a pistol grip and... And rails and whatnot, and they think, oh, then that must mean that those guns are bad, which is completely false. This is what a... Like a high-caliber rifle will do, like the AK. That's a handgun. That's a.22. A.22,.22. That's part of a shotgun. It sends a pretty cool message when, you know, we have our pro-gun rallies and we got thousands of people coming. And then they do their little anti-gun rallies, and they got maybe 20, 40. Only put 10 in there. [man] This is the start of a movement, people. I want to introduce the best friend that you have in the Oregon legislature, State Senator Ginny Burdick. [cheers and applause] When the issue comes home, it's time to act, and that's what we're doing now. So what I'd like to ask all of you to do is to become activists. When we are silent on this issue, the other side wins by default. We can be silent no more. [cheers and applause] I started work on the gun issue in 1996. I had always been annoyed that we couldn't as a society talk about reasonable gun laws. [man] Virginia Marie Burdick. She's been talking about gun safety and gun restrictions since I've known her. I can't think of any other legislator who's been as much in the forefront or is such a strong voice as Ginny. I don't think anybody's close to her. [Sen. Burdick] We have language that refers to transfers between immediate family members not having to be subject to the background check. And we want to broaden that out a little bit. And are we speaking to all of the bills? Focus on the Benson schools bill. Public education is... Is at risk. [Sen. Burdick] In my campaign, I was about stronger gun laws. Because of that, I felt a sense of mission. It was very important for me to do it. Wow. Some earrings? - [Paul] Yeah. - That's cute. [Paul] They collected everything and kept it. Wow. So this is the stuff directed to the Forsyth family. This is stuff that's just kind of directed to both. Those are cards and stars for Cindy. They put together these books with notes, and there's a book for each family. And then these were just different items left at the memorial. I thought this one was especially cool. - [Jenna] That's awesome. - [Paul] This took somebody a while to do that one. I can't believe people did this. [Paul] One of Macy's cosmetic girls. I'm sure Steve would stop and talk to them. [chuckles] 'Cause that was right near where his stand was. [Jenna] Yeah. - [Jenna] They're hard to look at. - [Paul] Yeah. [Jenna sniffles] [Lars] Welcome back to The Lars Larson Show. It's seven minutes after the hour, and I'm in one of the best places you can ever be on a Friday for First Amendment Friday because we're making it a Second Amendment Friday. I'm at Northwest Armory on Southeast McLoughlin. This place is a madhouse today. It looks like shopping day after Thanksgiving. [man] Our business has been exponential amount of growth. There's been a lot more interest in personal protection since there's been a couple national tragedies. There's also been a lot more interest with the possibility of legislation, and people concerned that they're not going to be able to get access to things that they used to be able to have access to. [Lars] The Oregon legislature is considering four really bad bills. They would take away people's right to carry guns in various places, including... One of them would limit your ability to carry in a school. If the janitor at Sandy Hook Elementary had carried a pistol and he heard the shooting down the hallway and people screaming and then saw a young man not in a police uniform running at him with an AR-15 and had shouted to the guy, "stop," and then pulled his pistol out and shot Adam Lanza, would that have been a good thing or a bad thing? The folks like Ginny Burdick and those, you know, nitwits, why would they think it would be a bad thing for people... Legitimate law-abiding people, to carry a pistol in a school? [man responds faintly over headset] [Sen. Burdick] The rally starts at noon. I'll be saying a few words and then introducing other legislators who are coming. [man] Have you heard anything in the wind about any counter protests? We expect a counter protest, yeah. Do you guys have the... Do you have, like, the little sleeves for the coffee cups? We're going down to Salem because Ceasefire is holding a rally, and we're going to go show them that they're not gonna get away with what they're getting away with. - [woman] And I urge... - [applause] I urge our senators to send a message to Oregonians that the safety of our citizens, of our families, of our children is their top priority. [cheers and applause] Right. Paul. [woman]...1,000 people in Portland, and there are more than 90,000... [cheers and applause] [crowd chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [man] What if our citizens that fought against the British would have taken your stance? There wouldn't be a United States today. And that's the end of the argument! So thank you all for coming. You guys are gonna make a difference, you really are. [man] The Second Amendment was created to keep the United States government in check. It's to support government, not to combat government. I think that people should be able to hunt. I think people should be able to target shoot. But they do not need weapons that are semi-military. With what you say is okay? You're just shouting me down, so you're not reasonable. You want us to respect your opinion, but you won't respect ours. These pieces of legislation provide common-sense gun controls. [woman] The guy who just got killed, and his wife in Texas, they had guns. It didn't stop that. I'm anti-massacres of children, but I'm anti-guns that have... That have no purpose - out on the street. - And if we would arm our teachers, we would have a lot less massacring done. - The more guns... - No! The more good guys... The more that good guys have guns... A gun in the hands of a good person is not a bad thing. A gun in the hands of a bad person is a bad thing. [overlapped chatter] [Sen. Burdick] What we're do gonna is we're gonna do a series of panels, you know, encourage all the gun owners you talk to to come when the time comes. I'm finding that people are pretty timid. Because these people have never stood up to the opposition. You... you have years of experience. You're used to that kind of intimidation. [device rattling] [woman speaking faintly] You are about to hear just a very angry voicemail from someone out there. [man] Ha ha, you stupid cunt. I have more guns than you can count. I'll never give them up. Fuck you. [automated voice] Received May 8 at 10:45... There you go. Yeah, I think we're good. Press one to save... "Hitler and Stalin would be so proud of you. "You guys are pathetic. "You are a waste of the oxygen I breathe. "It's just too bad that you people "were starved from the nipple, or maybe you guys would have all your brain cells." "Lynching is an extrajudicial execution "carried out by a mob, often by hanging, but also by burning at the stake." Unsigned. [theme song plays] [Al Sharpton] In Oregon, pro-gun advocates are intimidating lawmakers with threatening emails and video surveillance. Joining me now is Oregon State Senator Ginny Burdick. You canceled the town hall meeting, and then what did they do? I did, and when I canceled the town hall meeting, I didn't want to say anything inflammatory, so I just said the standard "scheduling conflict." Well, they showed up at my house and they stayed in front of my house for two and a half hours taping everything I did. And then they put it on the web, and their point was that I didn't in fact have a scheduling conflict. But they ran my address and they ran very threatening comments about it. - Was that all right? - Yes, you were good. Wow, I didn't know any of that was going on, my goodness. - Yeah. - Watching you take out your trash. It was really creepy. I'm not too happy about them coming into the capitol. [Baird] My team and I provided physical security for Senator Burdick on probably three or four occasions in the Portland area. People had confronted her. In one case, she was walking to her car, and somebody jumped out of the brush. Certainly we really took this quite seriously when Congresswoman Giffords was shot in Tucson, Arizona. How do you know something like that's going to happen? So we believed at that point that she had a legitimate right to be concerned about her welfare. [cheers and applause] [Chris] She's a public figure. People understand that public figures don't really have privacy. I think Ginny Burdick's a bitch. She had what's coming to her. I think if she's that scared, she should just step down. She should just get over it and move on and, uh... quit her job, because nobody likes her. [laughs] I'm not bitter at all, by the way. - [laughs] - [sneezes] [Chris] Oh, I was gonna show you this now. This one was my very first tattoo. It's a cross. That one's my flag. I did that on myself. It's the heritage stuff. I have a lot of family from the South and whatnot, so. Yeah. [female reporter] Lawmakers plan a marathon public hearing on four bills. They include a ban on guns in schools and criminal background checks for private gun sales. So we should be there by... This is telling me 7:30. I mean, hopefully, this'll be a good forum, and people will be open to everyone's message, um, on... On all sides of the issue. None of us can replace Steve, but we can try to make things better. [Jenna] Back in January, my friend invited me to this community meeting about gun safety. I literally just stood up there and said, "Hey, this is who I am. My mom was killed at Clackamas Town Center." And silence swept the room. By just standing up and saying that, I'd made it real for everyone. I realized then in that moment, I do have a voice. Maybe I can make an impact. [Robert] I want people to remember. I don't want people to forget that people were murdered and how they were murdered and that we need to change this cycle of violence that seems to be going on in our communities. Big day. Let's hit it. [Sen. Burdick] Politicians back down just because they don't want to take the harassment, and that is what results in no change. And I just refuse to be intimidated, because I can't in good conscience after Newtown back down. [indistinct conversations] This issue is very simple to members of the public, but somehow when you get into the charged environment in this building, it becomes more difficult. [man] Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. I'm going to go ahead and open up the Senate Committee on Judiciary. This morning we have four bills that are before us that we're going to be taking public testimony. Each of these bills have amendments that will change the actual purpose of the bills. In conducting today's hearing, I ask that everyone be respectful to the speakers and their views, even though you may disagree with those positions. I think it's very important that we have this hearing today to decide on what, if anything, will be moving forward. Senate Bill 700 would finish closing the loophole to require background checks for all gun sales. These bills will do nothing but target law-abiding citizens. They're not going to affect the criminals. They don't solve any of the problems that we've had. The fact that this state continues to allow the private sale of guns without background checks is reckless, irresponsible, and downright dangerous. None of these bills will keep the guns out of the hands of a single criminal or madman. If more people had been killed at Clackamas Town Center, we would have a more comprehensive law. We're legislating a reaction to a tragedy that it won't prevent. It is true criminals will always get guns, but let's make it harder for them. For women and those with disabilities, guns are the great equalizer. Senate Bill 347 would allow school districts, rather than one advocacy group or another, to decide what really is a safe school. There is no place in our schools for guns. Gun-free zones might as well be advertised as potential killing zones. Students were almost unanimous in their opinion that their sense of security would not be enhanced with additional weapons on-site. You need somebody at the school to stop that person. The laws we have and the systems we have in place do not work. The NRA can spread their money around and their influence, but it's only you folks, the legislators, that can write and pass the laws that we all live by. [man] All right, thank you very much. And our next panel, please come forward. None of these bills would have stopped the shooter that killed my mother at Clackamas Town Center. Still, it is an important action for this legislature to demonstrate that they are serious about making our community safer. Reducing gun violence is a complicated issue, but that is not an excuse for inaction. I'm here today in hopes of opening a dialog on gun safety. Please don't make the same assumption that I did, believing that this couldn't happen to me. It could easily have been your wife, your husband, your daughter or your son. [man] Do you remember Katrina? Do you remember 9 I 11? What happened? Overnight, nothing mattered. Politics didn't matter. Where you were from didn't matter. People would do anything to help the people. That's never happened since this terrible tragedy in Connecticut. It didn't happen. And I knew when it didn't happen... I mean, if you slaughter children the way they were slaughtered and you slaughter six students... Six teachers who are trying to defend their bodies and defend them the way they were slaughtered, and that can't bring us together instantly, then, my friend, this thing will never come together. [male reporter] There are now six state associations and 262 individual sheriffs who are on record opposing any new gun control legislation. [female reporter] This week, the sheriffs of five Oregon counties sent out letters that they would not support laws passed by Congress that trump the liberties of citizens. [man] It's addressed to Vice President Joe Biden. "I will not tolerate nor will I permit "any federal incursion within the exterior boundaries "of Grant County, Oregon, "or any type of gun control legislation "aimed at disarming law-abiding citizens "as the goal or objective. "As sheriff for Grant County, I too will publicly state "that I will refuse to participate or stand idly by "while the people I represent are made into criminals due to your unconstitutional actions." This is my basic police class back in the late '80s when I went to the Police Academy. Things are happening in our country right now that 40, 50 years ago, it was unthinkable about people, the mass casualties and the killings and the bombings, and I don't like it either, but I think that people need to take responsibility into their own hands and be prepared. I heard one talk show one time, they were talking about, well, if our government has nukes, do you propose that you have nukes? And my thought was, if they're gonna use a nuke against me, I would like to have a nuke to level the playing field. You know, it's a little unrealistic, but let's be realistic, that if our government or anybody else is gonna use a tank against us, it would be nice to know that I have the same ability to protect the people that have elected me into office, that I could step to that same level. I don't anticipate ever wanting or having to have a tank or the use for one, but if somebody was to use one against me, it would be in our best interest to be able to defend ourselves, and that's what the Second Amendment's all about. [Mund] I'm not in the camp of anti-government, but I think less government intervention into our lives would be a good thing. And I think there's a big divide there between, you know, what we call Western Oregon, or the Valley, the Portland area, and rural Oregon. A lot of what we get from the politicians is a knee-jerk reaction. I don't have a tremendous amount of ease in how they do things. And I think the gun control, whatever you want to call it, is a very good example of that. [gunshot] Killed that pine cone. I don't know that the solutions to lessen the chance of a Sandy Hook type incident is gonna come from gun control. I think it's much deeper than that. Do I know what the answer is? No, because there's... I think it's a very complicated, very complex problem. Guns were part of it. We have to decide what we're willing to accept on both sides of the fence. You know, are we willing to accept what happened, you know, in these different instances? If not, then what are we willing to accept... You know, laws and rules... To lessen the potential of that happening again? [wind whistling] [typing on keyboard] [on video] My name is Francine Wheeler. My husband David is with me. We live in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. David and I have two sons. Our older son, Nate, soon to be 10 years old, is a fourth grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our younger son, Ben, age 6, was murdered in his first-grade classroom on December 14th, exactly four months ago this weekend. I've heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded. But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy. We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass common-sense gun-responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us. Help this be the moment when real change begins. [sighs] Boy, talk about making a difference. [man] What went through your mind watching that, Ginny? Pain. The pain. And how she was able to... you know, rise above her own pain to try to keep others from having to experience pain. More than 3,000 people have died since Sandy Hook, and every single one of them had families who are experiencing that pain. And she's trying to do something about it, um, even though she's in desperate pain herself. I really admire her. [man] How does it make you feel watching her stand up like that so publicly? Well, it certainly... It certainly drives me. You know, I... I'm a legislator, and I haven't had this kind of loss in my family, knock on wood. But people are depending on me and my colleagues to keep them safe and to have reasonable gun laws so that this kind of thing won't happen again. And now I need to find a Kleenex. - I tell you... - [alarm beeping] the flippin' vote today, I couldn't believe it. I thought for sure the Senate would... Would do it. [typing on keyboard] [Obama, on video] A few months ago... Gabby Giffords there. In response to too many tragedies, this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence. A few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn't worth it. We had a Democrat and a Republican, both gun owners with "A" grades from the NRA, come together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. Those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. After I saw the vote didn't pass, I just was absolutely... crushed and thought that all the senators, the entire Senate should be ashamed of itself. If those kind of weapons were less available or harder to get, we wouldn't have a lot of these shootings, and we certainly wouldn't have the number of deaths. I'm convinced of that. Um... I don't know. It's bullshit. [Sen. Burdick] Good to see you. [Jenna] I met with Prozanski, and he gave me an update on what's going on. Yeah, so basically, what this move means is the Senate president has actually taken the bills and referred them to the Rules Committee without sending them to the floor first. Because he thinks that they won't pass on the floor. Right, he... he doesn't think they have the votes. I disagree. We're talking about people who are gonna be running for re-election. So, you know, it's one thing for the Republicans, because the Republicans know that the president does not like to bring guns... "bring guns"... Bring bills to the floor without the votes to pass. So naturally they're gonna say, "We're not gonna vote for it," hoping to keep it off the floor altogether. - [Jenna] Okay. - Because then if they don't have to vote, - then they can hide from the issue. - Oh, I see. I see. [Jenna] Background checks is like... That seems like a no-brainer to me. I don't know why we're even, like, having to vote about it. Yeah, I mean, we were disappointed that there weren't, like, stronger bills on the table. So the fact that these really... I mean, honestly, they're really weak bills... Can't even get passed... It's sad that they can't get passed. [chirps] [medicine bottles rattling] That one can get thrown away. [sighs] Okay. This is what happens when you have a child with lots of medical problems. All right, I'm putting all of these in one so you don't have to worry about it. He has scoliosis, and he just had surgery in August. This one right here they did was that he has... - [whispers] Spondylolisthesis. - Spondylolisthesis. And has has an extra vertebra. So instead of sitting like this, it sat like this. And it was cutting off blood flow and nerves and all of that. He is a high-functioning autistic. I wish I could see the world like he sees it for one day. The... the... [sighs] hearing things that normal people don't hear, seeing things that normal people don't see. He sees details that we don't, and he hears things that we don't. And I... I would love to see the world as he sees it, because he... He picks up everything. He feels things that we don't feel, temperature variations and differences in textures and smells, and it's awesome. I'd never, ever, ever want him to be, quote, "normal," 'cause kids with autism rock. [laughs] He's shot BB guns. He's shot.22s. He's shot, you know, .25s and all of that. You know, he talks about he wants an AK. [laughs] I don't know if I want to spend that much money. [laughs] But, yeah, he has... He has his own guns, and when he gets better and gets healthy and where he can stand up for a long period of time and handle the recoil, we'll go shooting. [radio host] 11:18, busy day today. Biggest story in our city for sure is the one-year remembrance of the Clackamas Town Center shooting. Cindy Yuille lost her life there. She was a hospice care nurse. Her daughter, Jenna, is in the studio with us. How are you doing a year later? [Jenna] I don't know. Not great, honestly, um... [host] Are you angry? I would be so furious. Yeah, yeah. Someone asked me the other day if I will ever be able to forgive this person who killed my mom. The answer is no. Jenna, I hope everything gets better. - [Jenna] Thanks. - I really do. We'll be out there tonight, 5:30, candlelight vigil, Clackamas Town Center. I hope you come down. [female reporter] At this time of the year, malls around the country are packed with parents and children. Many of them are going to see Santa. And for a lot of families who were here at the Clackamas Town Center one year ago tonight, that magical moment turned tragic. Jenna, are you gonna speak first? [Jenna on microphone] We are gathered here this evening because a year ago today, my mom and Steve were murdered... right here at this mall. [voce breaking] My mom was absolutely amazing. She was kind and generous and accepting. I don't know how to express the depth of how much we miss her every day. [Chris] This last October, my sister-in-law Jessie, she was brutally murdered. She was shot in the head by her husband, who she was in the middle of a divorce with. She got a restraining order. Not too long after, he forced his way into her house and shot her in front of her two young daughters. I was asked afterward by several people, "Chris, doesn't that change how you see gun control?" I always responded with, "Absolutely not." My wife is over there selling shirts to raise money for domestic violence awareness in her sister's name. [man] Can you go back to that day? Well, we were getting ready to watch the football game, and... sorry. [sniffles] That day's hard. [sniffling] So we were getting ready to watch the football game. The Ducks were playing, and... [sniffles] I got a call from my mom, and she said that there was a shooting over at Jessie's apartment. [sniffles] And we didn't know where Jessie was. And at first I was like, okay, so there was a shooting. Didn't know it was Jessie. We didn't really know anything. [sniffles] And then... I called around to the hospitals, and they told us where she was at, and we found her. And I was the first one there to see that she was shot in the head. [sniffles] [sighs] If her address was concealed a little better, it probably could have at least slowed it down. But I think the biggest thing that would have helped is if she was armed. The ridiculousness of the gun grabbers has gotten to epic proportions, people. How many of you guys have heard of the board game Clue? You've got the pipe wrench, the lead pipe, the rope. Guess what? The revolver piece that was less than a 1/2-inch big offended a parent, and they removed it. I think they have forgotten we are the boss. They work for us. What we say goes, not what they say. [cheers and applause] [phone keyboard clicking] [man 1, on recording] Shame on you, motherfucker. [man 2] We're looking for you. [man 3] I pray you get every inch of fucking shit coming to you, fucker. You burn and rot in the flaming depths of fucking hell. [man] Why do you think there isn't much civil dialog on this? Why has it become so polarized, and is there a middle way? Is there a middle ground somewhere that we can find? You know, after Newtown, I thought there was a middle ground. I thought, we're gonna ban these clips, these multiple-shot clips, that's gonna happen, and we're gonna get background checks. But then both of those things were blocked. Those things never happened, and I sort of lost hope, and I think a lot of people have lost hope. There really doesn't seem to be a middle ground. And one of the things that I tried to establish in Guns was that there should be a middle ground. [birds chirping] [Jenna] I still think something simple is best, like, maybe something like this, where it's just the simple outline of the state. And then just get rid of the background color, - if you just had the outline and that was it? - Right. [Belluschi] The gun control movement needs to understand it takes a long time, it takes persistence, it takes patience, but it takes constant advocacy. Mothers Against Drunk Driving was started in 1980. It was one small change after one small change. And one small change might occur in one state, and then another state would adopt that, tougher penalties for offenders, more prevention programs, lowering the illegal limit for drunk driving. I have seen a similarity between some of the tactics I think the NRA is using compared to some of the tactics that the alcohol and hospitality industry used in our fight, particularly to lower the illegal drunk driving limit. The alcohol industry initially in Illinois said absolutely not. They are gonna take away your glass of wine at dinner. They are gonna make a criminal out of somebody who has a cocktail. All these bars and restaurants are gonna have to close. We were able to prove that those claims were, number one, not true. And number two, once we did pass the law, the hospitality and alcohol industries joined with us to promote the law. So it will be great if at some point the NRA joins with the gun control advocates and says, let's do work together on this, and we can find common ground. [indistinct conversation] [traffic passing] [siren wailing] [police radios chatter] [man] If it seems there is a shooting in a school every week now, a group that keeps count says there nearly is, about one a week since Newtown. The latest happened just hours ago near Portland, Oregon, and it was deadly. [female reporter] They say the shooter that went into that high school this morning is dead along with one student. That shooting began just after 8:00 this morning just as students were getting started with their day. A very active scene and a community in shock after a shooting in Troutdale at Reynolds High School. [Sen. Burdick] My first reaction was, "Not again." And then my second reaction was to get really mad. Somebody was raising a child in a house with an AR-15 and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. What kind of message was that child being sent living in a house like that? Yeah, they have a Second Amendment right to do it, and we got two dead kids to show for it. And I just feel a sense of personal failure. What could I have done to make a difference? Um... and that haunts me all the time. [voice breaking] We... have to work harder. [man] Yeah.

[indistinct conversations] I get to the point a lot where I'm like, "Uh, nothing's changing." You know, same old, same old. And then I'll do these little things, and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, okay, I can make a difference." We're about to start the next session. We are really hoping to pass some bills finally. Ready? One, two, three. [birds chirping] [man and woman speaking indistinctly] [female reporter] A gun bill took center stage in Salem today, and Senate Bill 941 passed by just a few votes after several hours of debate. [gavel bangs] [Paul] I think the stakes are higher because it's gotten out of the Senate. A lot of anxious folks one way or the other. So it's a big deal. A bill's never gotten this far. [woman] I want to thank everybody for coming. We're gonna work as hard as possible to make sure that everybody is able to get their voice heard. Despite the continuing incidents of gun violence in our own state, Oregon lawmakers have failed to fix problems in our gun laws. That is an embarrassment, and it's time for a change. We are about to reach the culmination of a 20-year... Close to a 20-year process. [indistinct conversations] [woman] Good morning, colleagues. Happy Monday to everyone. The House will come to order. Representative Williamson moves adoption of the committee report on Senate Bill 941. It closes the loophole in Oregon's 25-year background check law for selling and transferring firearms. [Robert] When I realized that things might actually change was when we were in the balcony and actually voting on it. [woman] Clerk will open the voting system. [Rachel Maddow] In today's climate, it is almost im-freaking-possible to pass any kind of gun-safety reform, but Oregon is bucking the national trend. [indistinct conversations, cameras clicking] [Paul] It's too late for Steve. It's too late for Cindy. It's too late for others, but it will have a positive impact and it will save lives down the road, there's no question about it. - There we go. - [applause] [Robert] We have accomplished something, and something that we did with Cindy in our minds. She was a remarkable woman. She was a very strong advocate for justice and for things that are right. [Jenna] She'd be really proud. She would be. It's weird to think about stuff like that. Like, I wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for her death. But, um... but yeah, no, she would be really proud. [chuckles softly] She'd be cheering us on, totally. [Sen. Burdick] There is a lot happening in our country. It's just not happening as fast as some people would like, including me. But it's... it's happening. [Paul] I don't see myself backing away from this issue for a quite a while. There's too much at stake. [Robert] It takes time to change things around. I've learned to accept that. But change does come as long as you're persistent. [Jenna] It's turning more and more into an issue for people. Every one person that's killed affects the whole community. I don't accept the idea that mass shootings have to be a part of American life.
