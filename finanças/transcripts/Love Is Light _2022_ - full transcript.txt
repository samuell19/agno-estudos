[Love is something everyone can talk about but no one can talk about it correctly. - Shiirou Kita] Are you alright? Fine. Just so happens, I'm feeling hot. What? Sorry, sorry. Yo, Saijo. Oh, Kitashiro. What's wrong? You look more stern than usual. What's going on with the female students, is it a mating season? Are they sparkling? Yeah, a lot of them. It is a time for freshmen to meet new people, attend drinking parties and do club activities. Naturally they will fall in love. I see. Stand still. Yeah? I'm off to work. See you. See you. Shinonome? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you looking for this? Yes. Thank you. You read a lot. Ah, no. I'm sorry. I read the book. Do you like reading? It's difficult to understand since it's accompanied with empathy, so it's not 'like'. Then, why do you read? I want to understand what is love. I apologise if I said something strange. Thank you for finding my book. Time is finite. Fortunately, I enjoy myself every day. I have a lecture and a part-time job. With my current livelihood, my dream of becoming a teacher will come true. I even have my own personal enjoyment. I feel the difference in the air at night. The sky, the sea, the trees, and the flowers show me a different expression every season. Also, I feel calm whenever I come here. I'm glad there are no women. There's a beautiful woman over here. But, I still can't get that word out of my head. Still going... I want to understand what is love. That's what she said. She? Kitashiro. What is love? No, you don't need to do that. It's "I love you so I want to see you", "I want to be with you forever" and "unfulfilled feelings". For me, love is light. The light emitted by a women in love is annoying, an eyesore and troublesome. It's just a nuisance. I see. Is it good to carefreely thinking about love in this troubled times? I think so. Everyone likes love. All the great people in the past talked about love and the times was more difficult than it is now. It's hope. You're right. It's not an exaggeration to say that love created literatures. Love is a cosmic activity. By Natsume Soseki. You've fallen. What? Love at first sight? No... I... Stop playing dumb, you look flustered. No, I'm not. Those who truly love each other will fall in love at first sight. Shakespeare said it. Shakespeare quoted a quote from Christopher Marlowe. Just be honest. It's love, right? You've fallen in love. It's nothing like that. But I'm curious. You're too loud. Who is it? Where is she from? She's probably, Shi... Shinonome-san. Shinonome... That Shinonome-san? Do you know her? What do you think? I'm certain. That's her. I knew it. You fell in love with that type of person. What do you mean? She's beautiful, it's everyone's dream. You're right. Good morning, Kitashiro-san. Kitashiro-san? - Is he your boyfriend? - No, he's not. - Really? - Yes. My name is Yadorigi Minami. I'm Saijo. Let's go, Minami. See you later, Kitashiro-san. See you later. What was that? Not good. I still can't get it out of my head, the bosom just now. Stop it, I'm not thinking about that. Then what? Kitashiro. What? Can you introduce me to Shinonome-san? Introduce? Is there a problem? I've never talked to her before. I see. She's a bit strange. She seems lack of worldly sense, a bit different from your hermit like image. I see. I've heard she doesn't have smartphone, TV or computer. She also doesn't attend drinking parties. She probably doesn't have any friends at school. But she doesn't seem like a gloomy person. She's full of mystery. Well... But still... Can you introduce me to her? Can't you? Well, only if you take me out to play next time. No problem. Okay. [Exchange Note] What's wrong? Your meeting with Shinonome-san, I thought you were going to confess to her. It was too sudden, if you didn't have a back-up plan you'd be in trouble. A back-up plan? The diary exchange. You surprsied me. You're a very interesting. I remembered there was a notebook from my grandmother in my grandfather's belongings. I see. On that notebook, she wrote about the food she made and how she felt about it in the notebook. I see. My grandfather used to work night shift when he was younger and that's how he interacted with my grandmother. That's nice. Yeah. There's something that strikes a chord. Then a regular notebook should be fine. You might have gotten lucky by using diary for kids. Huh? For kids? What's wrong? You're right. It's for kids. It's for kids no matter how you look at it. You think so? The world is definitely changing. I didn't know there was such a thing for kids. It has been like that for a long time. What? It was really popular in our class when we were in elementary school. Well, I didn't have any friends. Why do you have it? Didn't you give it to Shinonome-san? This is the second book. I see. What did you write? I wrote a lot of things. But mainly, I wanted to define love. That's good. It seems like Shinonome-san will like it. Really? Yeah. Saijo, I just thought of something. What is it? I never imagined I'd drink beer with you like this when we were in elementary school. I thought the same when I drank with you for the first time. I was so nervous that I drank a lot so I don't remember much. I see. It's been about two years since we met. I was worried about what to do if you got drunk in Tokyo. I'm relieved. I'm glad you're still the same as ever. I'm relieved too. You're still radiant as always. You're right. Let me tell you, while you were in Tokyo, I fell in love wholeheartedly. What? Is that so? Of course. I was probably full of sparkles. I see. I'm sorry. No, you didn't have to do that. Did you write your address and phone number in your diary? What? Well, there's a place to write it. Good. So Shinonome-san will write her personal information too. You can make a lot of money. Make money? Yeah. She looks like she has a lot of hidden fan. I'm going to sell her personal information to them. What? This is going to make me happy for awhile. You... Saijo-san. Shinonome-san. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. Actually... Look. What is it? It's a diary. I made it. The size of this diary seems strange. Maybe it's for kids, it's made to match their size. I see. As expected from Saijo-san. That's a unique point of view. Not really. I've had a great time this week. Even a small incident, made me wonder whether I should write it or not. I wondered how I should write it. Every day appears to bring a new experience. It's very stimulating. What's especially nice are the bad news and the good news. Even if there's something bad I became so happy. Why? Because there's something to write. Saijo-san. Thank you for inviting me. [I will also define love.] In the last 10 years I roughly read about 3815 novels. 2968 of the novels... In other words, 90% of the novels are more or less love related. That much? Yes. I use them as a point of reference on my thought about love. Oh. There's so many different kinds of love depicted in the novels and they all share one thing in common. What is it? The feeling 'like'. I see. You may think it's obvious but where does the feeling 'like' comes from? Right, I never thought about that. All creatures including humans leave behind their genes by procreating and it's a natural instinct to do so. But I thought that alone could easily result in extinction especially for humans. Why is that? If the feeling 'like' doesn't exist, I think even if you can have children you couldn't properly raise them. Um... Is something wrong? No. I think you're right. Please continue. Ah, yes. In other words, I think the feeling 'like' is born from instinct and love is maybe one part of it. I see. In order for a creature to reproduce it will search for a better gene. Wild animals are especially straightforward they will select the strongest. However because humans are more complicated than any other creatures a greater gene variety can be considered. I see. So love is part of the gene. If you think about it that way... Humans are attracted to things that they lack. If you want kindness, you fall in love with someone who gives you kindness. If you want money, you fall in love with someone who has money. If you want sympathy, someone who has the same interest and viewpoint as you. Yes. That's right. What you want instinctively, is stimulated by love therefore it makes you like someone. The more subtle it is, the more you feel it's fated and the more excited you become. In other words, love is born from instinct. I think this is how I'd define it. Isn't instinct too dull? Is that so? It's not romantic. It's a little more... I feel the romance. What? It's an instinct that humans have had for 2 million years. I feel a great romance. Yes. Humans do not just inherit their ancestors' instincts. They also passed down their memories and experiences to the next generation. You're right. That may be the case. Shinonome-san... What kind of image do you have of love? Image? Yes. It's abstract and unobtainable... But it's a beautiful feeling that many people can feel. How about you, Saijo-san? Me? I... Right... I just want to see you. I just want to touch you. Oh, I'm sorry. It's too crude, isn't it? It's a magical word. I just want to see you. I just want to touch you. It made me feels warm as if I had a cup of tea. It's looking great. Is it? Isn't it? Well... Saijo... Yes? Is it because she doesn't sparkle so you're unsure whether that's a good or bad thing? No, that's... It takes time. I thought you were disgusting until I got used to it. The way you talk. I see. What? I'm kidding. Why don't you try taking her outside of the university? Maybe something will change. Should I invite her to a night out? Isn't that's a bit too difficult. You could try the movie. A movie? Don't you like movies? No. Once there's a couple in front of me, I can't see the screen because of the sparkle. That's annoying. I know. Good morning. Do you mind if I sit? Sure. What is it? Well... I was wondering where you got your clothes from. It's always unique. You mean this? I don't know where it's from because it's my grandmother's. If you're interested I can look it up. No, it's fine. I see. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. You're interesting, Shinonome-san. Are you into anything currently? Something I'm into? I suppose the definition of love? What? Oh, the thing you do with Souji. You know that? Yes. How do you define love? Me? That came on fast. Yes. Love, huh? For me, I think it's so close yet so far. So close yet so far? Sorry, don't take it seriously. If you look up the definition of love online you'll find a lot of things. Online? Why don't you use a smartphone or a computer? It's convenient. It may be convenient, but it's a bit much for me. Why? I have my hands full with information about my own surroundings and I also don't have any friends. So I think it's better to live in a way that suits me, for a little girl like me that would be a lot happier. I don't know whether that's positive or negative thing, that's one unwieldy statement. But it's possible if you don't have a smartphone, you couldn't make any friends. Is that so? Yes. When you make new friends, you exchange numbers. That's how you started to get along. A connection? You're right, I became friends with Saijo-san because of this. Right? Otsukare. This is a rare combination. It's you. What do you mean by that? What's that bag? It's cute. This is an exchange diary. What? Exchange diary. Is that so. With Kitashiro? No, it's with Saijo-san. Saijo-san? What about Kasuga and Suihiro? Is Saijo-san that Saijo-san? Kitashiro's boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. He's your boyfriend? No. We're just childhood friends. Is that so? Why are you exchanging diaries with Saijo-san? To be friends. That's great, I want to do it too. I knew you'd say that. No, you can't. Why? I also want to be friends with Shinonome-san too. Friends? You're not interested in exchanging diaries, are you? I am. You're lying. Shinonome-san, can I? No, you can't. I'm not asking you. I can't think of a reason why not. What? I did it. Why? I started this because I want to make new friends. Also I think it's better to have more people. No, no. Let's ask Saijo-san. I'm so happy. Then I want to do it too. Why do you want to do it as well? I don't want to be excluded. It's lonely. You... I'm sorry. I blew it out of proportion. No. I don't mind. I've another book. What... and here I thought I'd look up on Shinonome-san's interest and hobbies. Anyway, I can't go today. The deadline is tomorrow morning. What does she think? You don't like Yadorigi? I don't dislike her, I'm just a bit uncomfortable. Then it can't be helped. Do your best at work, bye. Bye. He can't come. The deadline is near. The deadline? Yes. Do you know a job that correct errors in a novel? Proofreading? Yes, that. I see. That's why? Yes? That's why? No, it's nothing. I see. Hey, is this really an exchange diary? It's weird. What's weird? You're only using "message" and "free space". The only time you used it correctly was at the start. It's more like a research paper than a diary. Also what do you mean by the definition of love? I don't get it. Right, as a person who has limited knowledge on medical expertise and trying to approach it with the knowledge I have... That's not what I mean. What did you write? Love is a result of hormonal factor in the brain that cause happiness. That sounds interesting. Yes. Wait a minute. What's wrong with you people? Well then, how do you define love? That's not the issue. Then what is the issue? Even without the definition, you would know. If you think you like someone, that's love, right? Why are you doing such a stupid thing? What's wrong? It becomes possible only when you recognize it. I use a metaphysical approach to define love, whereas Yadorigi-san use an epistemological approach. I see. That's interesting. No it's not. In other words, if I think it's love, it's love. That's what I'm saying. Yadorigi-san you're a genius. What? Are you making fun of me? No, I think she's serious. Come to think of it, I wasn't fond of this side of her. I see. Saijo-san. Shinonome-san. Are you tired? No, I'm fine. I'm sorry about yesterday. I couldn't make it. Did you finish your work? Yes, I did. Thank you for your hard work. About the exchange diary. I actually have a spare one. Would you like to do the definition of love separately? Oh, yes. I'm glad we can do that because I regretted it a little. Is that so? Yes. I'm sorry I said something without thinking. But how should I say this... Because of that something wonderful happened. Well, that's good. What's wrong? It's raining. Do you remember this? It's the notebook you picked it up for me. Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. No, it's not like that. I was happy. I felt like you're looking at me and also knew about me. Look. You did it properly until the end. Saijo-san, thank you. No, it's nothing. It seems to have stopped. Yes. Shall we go? Please wait. Let's stay a little longer. It's beautiful. It's sparkling in the sunlight. The world looks very vivid to me right now. It's as though a fog has lifted after so many years. It made so happy. Saijo-san. Yes? Is this love? Yes. I knew it. This man is a narcissist. He has a habit of preaching that suits his opinion. It's either seek consultation or pretend to be an idiot. Who is it this time? It's probably Kitashiro's... What's wrong? Your udon... What's up with that? I don't know... Hey, look. What? Wow. Really? Oh, she got rejected. Do you want to go out for lunch? Yes... Please. Let's go. Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? It's finally here. What's up? Finally? You look really nervous. I was wonder what it was. Did you? Yes. Do you like Saijo-san? No... Please forget about it. I'll answer your question. I like him. I knew it. But... you know... It's a little embarassing when you're sober. Do you want to go out for a drink? Sure. I'd love to but I don't have any money. How about a drink at my house? It's a little far. Great. Let's throw a pajama party as well. Lend me your pajamas. Okay. Is it Saijo-san? I'm sorry, I accidentally looked at it. It's okay. You're not answering the phone? No. We're on a train. I see. Shinonome-san. Yes, what is it? You said a little, isn't this a bit too far? What? Do you travel this far every day? Yes. Thank you. We're finally here. Glad you could make it. This way. Okay. This is the house. As expected from Shinonome-san. As expected? Yes. I knew you wouldn't let my expectation down. Is this your parent's house? Yes. Is this okay? What about your family? No, it's okay. I'm the only one who lives here. Wow. Wait a minute. You live here alone? Yes. Excuse me. Yes. It's Saijo-san. Yadorigi-jou. Jou... [嬢 (Jou) - Miss] Jou? Please come in. Wow, it's nice inside. Excuse me for intruding. Where are your books? I thought you had a lot. I usually read at the library. I see. Please sit down. I'll make you some tea. Okay. I don't want tea. Why not? Because I want to drink. Oh, that's right. Why are you here? I'm sorry, it was written in the diary. No, it's not that. Why are you here? Well... I think I've already said it before. I can't today. Actually, I have something important to consult with you. Something important? I'm... unable to properly fall in love. What? Why are you telling me that? You're talking about love with Shinonome-san. So if it's you, I can... No. I can't today. Why not? Well... I'm thinking of meeting Kitashiro. I see. Is that so? Huh? This is nice. I really like it. Yes. It's so relaxing. It's quiet and the air feels fresh. Yes. It tends to be lonely. I see. It must be lonely to be alone. I don't feel lonely because my uncle, aunt and cousins are nearby. But lately I feel that way. Have you always lived here? No. I grew up in Kobe when I was a kid. My grandmother took me in after my parents died in an accident. I see. Saijo was raised by his grandfather. Really? Yes. It's a little complicated. When I was in elementary school, Saijo's parents got divorced. He was abandoned by both of them. I see. That's why at that time... Did something happen? If the feeling 'like' doesn't exist, I think even if you can have children you couldn't properly raise them. I said something terrible. Saijo is surprisingly tough so it's fine. Really? Yes. He worked at a publisher in Tokyo to go to college. Isn't that amazing? Yes. He wanted to be a teacher so he could repay a favour, because I've been looking after him. I see. So that's why you call him sensei? No. It's a nickname since elementary school. He has always looked like a teacher. I see. What's wrong? I don't know anything about Saijo-san. Well, he's not the type to talk about himself. It's painful. When I think about your relationship with him. Is this what they mean by jealousy. I... I think I like Saijo-san. So... Don't worry. I've given up. What? Actually... I've been dumped. You've been confessed? No. How should I put it? Think of it as a drunk talk. Okay. Saijo can see the light of love. What? A women in love sparkles brightly. He can see that light. Is it bothering you? What? You look nervous. It's my fault, isn't it? I made you break your promise to Kitashiro. I'm really sorry. No. I was the only one who wanted to see her. I didn't make any promises. I see. Which one do you like? I'm sorry? Kitashiro-san or Shinonome-san, which one do you like? Like... Which one? Why do you ask? It's because they both like you. What? You just know when you see it. Especially Kitashiro. Again. Hmm? No. At least I can tell you that Kitashiro doesn't. Why? You just know when you see it. I don't seem to sparkle at all. He said that he'd never seen me sparkle. That means... I've been dumped before I can even confess. The light of the sun can be visualized by dust and water droplets. So it's a kind of substance? For example, if you can visualize pheromones... Shinonome-san... I'm sorry. Did you believe this story? Yes, of course. Thank you. But why didn't you sparkle when you're in love? Is there a limit to the amount of light he can see? For example, is the light too strong or too weak to see? I'd like to know too. Can I ask you what made you fall in love? Now that sounds like a normal love story. Yes. What made me fall in love? When I was in elementary school, my seat was next to him. He read a lot of novels. When I asked, is it interesting? He said it was hard to understand. Then why do you read it? He said it was interesting. That's what I said. Do you want me to stop? Please continue. Anyway, I don't know what made me fall in love. As we spent time together I somehow became concious of it and I somehow fell in love with him. It doesn't hurt to be with him now, it calms me down. Did you slowly come to realize how good Saijo was? I think so. So it's Shinonome-san. Why do you ask? Then why did you exchange diary with Shinonome-san? Because... Why? Because... I wanted to think love is beautiful. I always thought it was a nuisance. But after looking at it I don't think it's a bad thing. It's rather mysterious. What, are you drunk? Well, I didn't drink a lot of wine. You're drunk. Besides, love isn't that good, it's stupid. I see. Because, within three months, most of the girls who lost their boyfriends to me said they liked someone else. That's what like is. Isn't that stupid? So that's the reason. You're unable to properly fall in love. To be honest, it's more like stealing. The feeling of wanting someone else's boyfriend. I can see these things. I see. That's great. What? For example, when you order something online, you can choose the product based on the reviews. Yes. But you adopt that in your relationship, you base it objectively rather than using your personal standards. You're an instinctive person. Do people often tell you 'that's not what I'm talking about.' Am I being comforted? No, that's not what I mean. Listen. I'm a bad woman. I know it's wrong. I can't stop because it's so exciting. But that's... You're annoying. The reason I asked you out today was to steal you from them. Do you understand? What? So it wasn't for a consultation? Yes. Let me be clear, I'm not approaching you because I like you. I see. That means... it's either Shinonome-san or Kitashiro-san. Of course not! Then why? What was that? What is it? No... The light of love... That's enough. Let's drink, okay? Excuse me. Two of the same drinks. The same is fine, right? Thank you. What are you, a samurai? Maybe it's learning. Learning? Yes. Learning is the definition of instinct. So it's the opposite of instinct. By instinct, you mean leaving a descendant? Yes. Contrarily, learning... occurs when experience is applied to knowledge and the environment. It's more like learning how to behave. What you've seen and experienced you should recognize what you like analyze it so you could understand if it's love. While you're together your love towards the other grows, that's learning. That's me. Saijo-san can see love as a sparkle of light. And you don't emit any. Light is love itself. So learning is different from love. No. Maybe it's not love. What? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It was just my wild idea. I see. It's okay. I've given up. I see. My love wasn't love. Right? Right. I feel better now. I thought it was strange. I see. I want Saijo to be happy. He has been through a lot. It's fine if it doesn't have to be me. I think you've had too much to drink. I can't seem to calm down. Oh. I'm sorry. I know a spell to make you calm down. A spell? First, put your hands on the table. Okay. Close your eyes. Think of someone you like. Someone I like? That's... No, forget it. Okay, close your eyes. Okay. How long should I close my eyes? Wha... What did you... See? You've calmed down. Um... I... I'm going home. I won. I finally won. What are you? What kind of light are you? I'm so sorry. We were drinking and we got into that kind of mood... What's with the weak reaction? I'm not sure what's going on. What? I won't know until I talk to Saijo. Okay. Why don't you ask him. My chest hurts, my throat is dry, and my face is hot. It's like I'm having a fever. Are you okay? Maybe it's a fever. Be careful. Okay, I'll be careful. Okay? So this is intense jealousy. I see. If it's this strong of an emotions, it's not a mystery why it can become a motive for murder. I understand! In the works that sing about love and passion, some of them include stealing another's romantic partner. Sometimes it's treated as pure love. I couldn't understand it at first, but if I'm the main character, stealing another's romantic partner can be pure love. Yo, Shinonome! What's the deal with you two? That'll be 370 yen. Here are the items and receipt. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Huh? Saijo? Why are you hiding? Sorry. What's wrong? Well... I have a favor to ask. What is it? I'm really sorry, but... Could you lend me some money? That's a lot going on in a day. Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Huh? Yeah. I guess so. I can't believe Yadorigi is sparkling too. What do you think? About what? Whether she is in love or not? If it's her, I don't think it's love. It's more like a game. She also said the same thing. I see. The light I see... might not be the light of love. So, what are you going to do? About what? Shinonome-san. When she started to sparkle... For the first time I thought it was beautiful. But I'm not sure if the light is love. So I can't say anything until I find out. There are things I'd like to confirm regarding the light. Things you want to confirm? Yes. Before that, how do you feel? Huh? If you like Shinonome-san doesn't the light have nothing to do with it? My feelings? Yes. I think I like her. I see. But... I'm still confused by the light. I don't know if this feeling is love or if it's something else. In other words... I'm not sure how to say it. Love is something everyone can talk about but no one can talk about it correctly. That's it. Oh. Whose words are those? Who was it? I think it was Shiiro Kita. Shiiro Kita. I think I've heard that name before. Really? Shiirou Kita. Shirou Kita, Shiro Kita, Shiro Kita, Shiro. Huh? Kitashiro? Isn't that you? Um... Hmm? Did something happen? What do you mean? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I thought I was going to die. There you are. You don't have to purposefully avoid me. Excuse me, Saijo-san. Hello. You could at least give me a call. I went all the way to your house. I see. Here. Huh? Thank you very much. What? I didn't take the money inside. I took it from the table, though. Sorry for the trouble. You could give it to Kitashiro. Huh? Whatever. What are you doing right now? Nothing. Right. I have something to do. See you. Huh? Wait a minute. That's so cold. I'm sorry. I have some work to do. Something important. You could at least buy me a cup of tea. I have some work... to do. As I thought. It's here. Huh? W-Wait a minute. Excuse me. The painting called First Love on the front... Oh, thank you. Oosu-sensei's First Love? Yes. It's a work of an artist that the owner of the store particularly likes, but it's still relatively unknown. The price is as stated. No, I mean... I want to contact the artist. Huh? No, I mean... If you could, I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the artist's contact information. If you make a purchase, we may consider it. 4,000 yen. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm trying to find out the artist's contact information. Oosu Ou. Oh, that's... It's the artist's name so it won't show up. Really? Wait. I got the contact number. Huh? Don't misunderstand. Huh? That person is acquainted with the artist. Really? Why do you want to know the artist's contact information? Because this artist can probably see the light. What? [Talks about himself, their similar condition, intention to meet and a reply] (I can see the light) It's here. I knew it. [I would appreciate it if we could meet once.] [What do you think?] (Send me your photograph) A photograph? (Only if you bring along a girl.) A girl? Hai, Saijo. Sorry for the trouble. I'll leave it to you today. Okay. Actually, I was going to handle this by myself. Are you fine with me? Yadorigi helped you, didn't she? There's no one else besides you who knows about the light. Oh, you're right. Huh? Nothing. Well... I'm curious about the artist. What if the artist is a perverted old man? If that's the case, I'll do my best to protect you. You will? Yes. I see. Excuse me... Are you Saijo-san and Kitashiro-san? Yes, we are. Nakaba, it's going be fine. Huh? Nice to meet you. I'm Oosu Nakaba. Huh? Oh. You're the artist? I'm not... Yes. I see. Oh my god. I know, right? It took me two hours to get that picture. Huh? What's so funny? But I'm glad you're not a perverted old man. I disguised myself as an old man because I was scared. I see. That's why you said to bring a girl. Yes. I was planning to go alone at first, but my senior said she'd come with me. Is it okay for her not to be here? Yes. I didn't tell her about the light. I said I'm meeting someone who has a similar condition. So she's a little concerned. She's nice. Yes, she is. She's really nice. She's in the tennis club, she's so strong that she can compete in national competitions. She's popular with her classmates and juniors. She's really amazing. I see. Is she a high school student? Yes and she stays at the dormitory. I see. Can I ask you a question? Yes. Anything. About the light, I'd like to confirm something. Other than this table... That person and that person... And the clerk. Yes. Wow, we both can see the same thing! I'm so happy. Me too. I'm glad I came today. Can I continue with the question? Yes. I've always thought of this light as the light of love. What are your thoughts? The light of love. That's a good name. Yes. I never give it a name, but I think it's the light of love. Is that so? Is there a problem? I'm sorry. Can I continue? Yes. Why did you think it's the light of love? I started seeing it when I was in middle school. After I talked to the girls that sparkles, I'm convinced it was love. There were a lot of girls around me, so there were a lot of samples. I see. And my feeling is also love. Yes? That's... I was grateful when you said other than this table. It's not like I'm keeping it a secret. I love my senior. I see. Yes. I'm not saying it because I want to go out with her, but rather out of admiration. Admiration? I know what you mean. There's something like that. My school was co-ed, the senior female basketball players were extremely popular. Basketball is popular. Yes. Um, in other words, you recognize admiration as love. Is that what you're saying? I don't know if it's recognition or other challenging concepts. For example, when you're talking to a friend about a girl you're interested in, your interest grows. You might think you like her so when you're done talking about her, you're convinced you do. Isn't it the same? Huh? Maybe in terms of recognition. Huh? No, that's what Yadorigi said. Yadorigi? Yeah. If you think of it as love, that's love. I see. Um, it might be cheeky to say this, but don't you think love is different for everyone? In my dorm, there are people who are seriously in love with idols and treasure hunters. In fact, those people are also sparkling. I see. In other words, if Yadorigi think stealing as love itself, that's... Um, I'm sorry for saying something weird. Oh, no. This embarrassing, but I'm starting to understand love less and less. I think love is a happy and exciting thing. A happy and exciting thing? Yes. I'm sure you know, my senior is not sparkling. But I'm very happy and excited she came with me today. It almost makes me want to dance. Although I can't dance at all. I think that's why. What is it? It's happy and exciting, which is why a women in love sparkle. Um, my painting is currently on display over there, so please come and see it. This is the invitation. Oh, wow. Is this okay? Yes. That painting? It's a new one. I'm looking forward to it. And I have a favour to ask. I'd like you to vote for my painting. Vote? Yes. If you win, you can study abroad. That's amazing. But if you don't like it you don't have to vote. Well, I have to go now. I'm going to go see the painting with my senior. Well, I guess we'll go later. What's wrong? Oh, no. I don't know if I should tell you or not, but Saijo-san seems worried. I'm not trying to be flattering. Out of all the paintings I've seen, Kitashiro-san is the most beautiful and sparkling person. I thought you two looked great together. Bye. Ki... Kitashiro... Yes. Are... Are you sparkling? I don't know. I see. Yes. Well, you know, Kitashiro. What? I can't see it, but if you're sparkling... Saijo. My love might not be the light for you, but for a long time, for a long time I was happy when I'm with you. Even if I'm not sparkling, I... Did you like me? Yes. I really like you. I like you. I've always liked you. Kitashiro. I... Wait. I'm sorry. I'm worried that if I listen to what you have to say, you'll say something half-hearted and I'll feel teased. I'd better get going. Okay. See you. Yes. Hey, do you have the same religion as Saijo-san? What? Religion? You've been talking about a light. Oh... Well, that's fine. What do you mean? It's just love, aren't you exaggerating too much? I can't help it, I've never dated anyone before. Really? Yes. Kitashiro-san, I think I understand everything. What? The reason why Saijo-san couldn't see your light. That again. Learning is also love. I'm sorry I said something rude before. No, I was going to give up. Love is unreasonable. It brings you happiness and it's also painful. But it's more painful to give up. But I think I'll be dumped. No way. Can we stop talking about this? This is my first pajama party, but the vibe is terrible. What? Nothing. By the way, you should confess as well. If this is a shojo manga, you'll lose to a childhood friend. He'll be taken away by her. What? You never read a shojo manga? Yes. Why don't you try it. Is that okay? Anyway, to steal is love. You said it yourself. Stealing another's romantic partner is pure love. Am I wrong? Yes, she did. Yes, but... Love is a battle. I see. You're definitely a genius. You're making fun of me again! She's serious. Are you okay? I feel sick. I'm sorry. It's okay. I have something to talk to you. Don't push yourself. Please let me talk. Okay. The phone... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Okay. Water, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the trouble. It's fine, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. That's good. Well... You just saw my embarrassing side, now may not be the time. I've come to a conclusion about love. Huh? Love is... an emotion that comes from instinct and learning. An emotion that comes from instinct and learning. Yes. Instinct and learning. These two things stimulate each other, that's how love is born. I see. Instinct and learning. Love is complex and broad, because it's a combination of contradictions. I don't know how to explain it properly. I also think it applies to the light of love. You knew about it? Yes. Kitashiro-san told me. Kitashiro-san also told me about you. This is just my guess, I apologize if this is impolite but... I believe you crave affection and love. That's why I can see the light of love? Yes. After my parents abandoned me, I was able to see the light of love. I sorry if what I said was impolite. Even now... It's okay. Also... The reason you couldn't see Kitashiro's light of love... Yes. You didn't know about motherhood, did you? Yes, you're right. Especially my mother, I don't have any fond memory of her. Motherhood comes from maternal instinct and is often thought to be genetic. In fact, in recent years, It is generally accepted that motherhood is formed by learning. That's why you can't see the light because it's really close to learning. I see. Kitashiro-san's invisible light... I think it's as deep and gentle as motherhood. But I... Saijo-san. Am I sparkling right now? I'm sure I'm sparkling. No, I'm sparkling. Yes. I was able to know what is love. Saijo-san. I love you. I heard about Kitashiro-san's confession, I couldn't stand the thought of you and Kitashiro-san dating without doing anything. That's why I came here. I'm sorry for the impure reason. I'm feel afraid, hateful, embarrassed and pitiful. It's a raw, disgraceful and impure love. Its different from the love I imagined but this is my love. Even so, I love you. I just want you. There's still a matter with Kitashiro-san so I can't give you an answer. Yes. Also... I don't think your love is impure. Why? Because I can see it. Your beautiful light. Hello, it's me Saijo. Sorry to bother you. Can we meet up today? Hi. This is Nakaba-san's drawing, right? Yeah. It's nice, isn't it? Yes. I'm sure it can win. I hope so. Do you always see the world like this? It's much more beautiful than the world I see. I'm sure that's how she sees it. Don't make that face. You make the painting looks bad. Do you want to sit down? Yeah. Kitashiro. What? I want to thank you. Thank me? Yeah. If it weren't for you, from elementery school until high school I'd be a gloomy, depressed... How do I say this... I'd be living a miserable life. What do you mean? Just having you near me made me feel fullfilled. I was happy and excited just knowing that you care, I'm fine even if I'm alone. And also you said you love me. Thank you very much. What do you mean? I always thought you didn't see me as your romantic partner. You said you were in love while I was in Tokyo. That person is you. I see. I'm sorry. Well... I've had this strange confidence because you went more than ten years without a girlfriend. The time I left you alone. I was enjoying the feeling of love by myself. I was nervous, sad, and angry. I see. But love is between two people, right? Yeah. I thought of giving up. After you fell in love with Shinonome-san. Why? I had the impression you and Shinonome-san were similar. I thought you would look good together. When I first met Shinonome-san, I fell in love with her. I wanted to know what is love. I thought her pure heart was dazzling for me, who used to hate the light of love. Also she was honest, pure, and beautiful. And also interesting. Actually, I've already given my reply to Shinonome-san What? I went to her house and left her a note. I see. Yeah. About things from now on... What? Let's keep our distance for a while. I'm sure Shinonome-san won't like it. I want some time. So... When time passes, let's hang out as friends again. Kitashiro. Yeah? I'm not going to choose between you and Shinonome-san. I'm not in a position to choose. So I, need to understand my own love. What are you talking about? Shinonome-san's light is beautiful. The last time I saw her, her light was sacred and untouchable. That's right. My feelings for her are the same as that light. My feelings for her... If I were to borrow Nakaba's words... It's admiration. Admiration? Yeah. But, no matter how hard I think about my feelings for you, I still can't find an answer. I'm not sure how to say it. That's because you don't feel anything for me. I don't know how to express this feeling. I clearly know it, but I can't put it into words. Shinonome-san and Nakaba-san... calling them strangers it would be inaccurate. So... Before we get into what is love and how it's defined, I think can feel it in my heart, that... You are the person who appears when I close my eyes. What do you mean? I mean... I like you. What? I like you. I just want to see you. I just want to touch you. You're the only one who I feel that way. I mean... In another words, Please go out with me. No... That's a little... I see. You're right. I've gotten ahead of myself. No, um... You don't have to do it here. What? Everyone's watching. This is also love. Oh, um... Could you tell me your reply? Erm. This is? I see. Once again... from now on I'll be in your care. Saijo... Am I sparkling right now? No, you're not. I knew it. That's boring. Don't worry about it. I've already seen the light. Really? Yes. I told you before. You were the one who gave me hope throughout my depressing times. I don't understand. To me... You're the light. What I'm trying to say is... What? Love is the light. [Bonus Scene 1:48:23] [Love is Light] I received another present. Present? What did you receive? That's so cute. I want to properly fall in love.
