- Come on, come on, come on! - Hello! Sir, you just hit my car! Hey, start the car. Hey, start the car! - All okay? - Yeah! I'm just reconfirming it. Michael, is everything in order? We've tested the machine a lot of times... but testing the machine with you in the experiment... I'm a little scared. The resolution to all our problems lies in this experiment. Everything will be alright, Paul. Let's start! Mike are you okay? I'm going to the 2nd level. And... now! Yes! Yeah. Michael, we did it! Yes! Yeah! Michael! Michael! Hello, Hyderabad! Good morning! This is RJ Gautham. Once we wake up in the morning... we may have checked the climate and the weather and would've got ready for work appreciating it. Only when we step out you face the reality. A friend of mine cribbed to me... "Dude, I'm having a bad day. Seems like things are not in my favor." So, the topic we're going to discuss today is, Time! Today time is not favoring me. Today my time is really good. Everything is going in a sync. But today it's off sync and I'm doomed. Something or the other keeps bothering people. And we end up thinking about it And we all know that our deeds from the past... has a direct effect on our future. To discuss about time we have a guest on our show... the famous astrologer, Phanindra Sharma. Sir, Namaste, sir. Welcome to our show. Sir, please explain. Do the deeds from our past... affect our present and the future? That was a great question. Let me explain. People have a misconception about, Time. But time is relative. - Past, present and future... - Hey! - is all fiction. - You're getting a call. - It's 'cause... - You're getting a call. - life is a circle. - Hey, you're getting a call! Finally, the phone came to me! Life is similar to it. Everyone believes birth is the beginning of life. - But I don't subscribe to that belief. - Hello! Hey, broker. How long should I call you? Where are you? Since 10:00 a.m. I'm waiting at the site. Are you coming or not? Hello? Hello? Hey, broker, are you there? Sir-sir, I'm in the cab. On the way. You sound like you just woke up. If you're in the cab how come I don't hear the traffic? Sir, hold on for a minute. Driver, please roll down the windows. - Did you hear it, sir? - Yeah, I heard it. Earlier I didn't hear though. Sir, the AC was on so the driver had rolled up the windows. Hey, driver switch off the AC. Okay! Hey, broker... Actually, you should be waiting for me. Instead, I'm waiting for you. Get over here soon! Damn it, I'm fed up of people calling me a broker. I have a name and it's Seenu! Always address me as a broker. Hey, broker! Whisper. Can't you see I'm sleeping? Chaitu! Hey, I can't see your disgusting face early in the morning. You better get off from my face. Dude, I believe you asked me to wake you up at 10:00 a.m. right? That's right I believe it's time now. It's 11:10 a.m. now. Oh, damn, why did I look at your face? Shit! Bloody, idiot! I asked you to do one thing and you can't do that too. You're hopeless! I can't wake up myself and you expect me to wake you up. What is this? Oh, this is the matter. - What's the count now? - Which one? This girl. Are you going to get her or lose this one too? I have no idea. I'll first meet her then let you know. How many more are you planning to meet? Is there no end to it? Poor girls I wonder what pleases you. I ought to beat you. How does it matter? You have a cousin waiting for you. And that fellow has a girlfriend. Who do I have? There's no women in my office. What about Shailaja in your office? She put on 3 kgs. 3kgs? Did you lift her or what? - Mom, yes mom. Tell me, mom. - Where are you? That girl's family has been waiting for you. - Get here soon. - I'll be there soon. - I'm in the cab. - He's on his way in the cab. - Hey, are you really in the cab? - Mom, I am... - Driver! - Tell me, sir. Can you please roll down the windows? Front widows or the side windows, sir? Bloody! We never change do we? - Yet to see boys only. - Oh, God! Is he still sleeping? Hey, Aadhi, wake up! - Good morning! - What are you doing over here? - Congrats! - What is this? Voice of Nation singing competition... is taking place for the first time all over India. In Hyderabad, I'm organizing the event. Guess what? You've been selected in the 1st round. They've called you for an audition for the 2nd level. What are you looking at? I sent your cassette to them. Who gave you the permission to apply? Whose permission do I need, Aadhi? Vaish, I'm not ready yet. How long do you plan to just sing sitting inside your room? This is a TV show created to gain TRP. It won't suit me. First, you stop lying and agree that you're scared. You're scared of performing in front of the crowd. Aadhi, if you try you can overcome your stage fear. Everyone should know that you are talented. And your music-- You're doing it. Understood? I wanna go mom... But I don't have the confidence to do so or not. I don't know what to do. For the past twenty years whatever I told you... you've heard me out with a smile. I believe that you've been listening to whatever I say. Erm... okay! Track name: Always the same!

I am Mr. Seenu, sir. That's me. I'm urgently looking for a house. It seems like you are asking for 100 rupees. I meant to ask... your name, what kind of house are you looking for? And your preferred locality? Well, I am, Rangi Kutta Paul. Guttam Paul? What Paul, sir? - I don't understand, brother. - Rangi-Kutta-Paul. Go ahead, Paul, sir. I need an individual house in the outskirts. - Out-Skirts? - Outskirts uh? Hold on a minute, Paul, sir. - Where's outskirts? - I don't know, brother. How do I find out? I can neither understand his name nor the area he's asking for. Once, when I ordered potato curry on Swiggy... the delivery boy said he won't deliver if it's outskirts. - Do you remember? - Yes, yes. Paul, sir. This is Mr. Seenu, speaking. Paul, sir, please give me 2 days time. Sir? What happened? He hung up on me. Brother, how come you don't know this area? Maybe it's near Manikonda. Bloody idiot! Outskirts means outside the city not Manikonda. You always do your business within these limits. Expand, bro! Paul, sir, I found a great house in the outskirts. I've sent you photos on whatsapp, please check. - Once you do-- - I like it. I liked it. Okay! Hey, you guys are jobless, right. I have a client meeting. An affluent party. Let's meet him and seal the deal. Okay? I'll pay commission. Paul... Rangi Kutta Paul Seenu! Mr. Seenu! - I like the house. - Super, sir! Sir, when will your family arrive? Family? No family. I'm single! Hey, Chaitu, your future. Sir. Paul, sir. Don't take me wrong. What do you do, sir? The landlord wants to know. I'm a Quantum Physicist. Condom? Con-- Couldn't understand is it? Scientist! Scientist uh? I think he'll find the cure for cancer. If you're a scientist why do you prefer this kind of house? - Why can't I? - Yeah, why can't he? You're right. Abdul Kalam, sir was a simple man but reached great heights. You're correct, Paul, sir. Sir, give your Aadhar Card and ID card to my assistant. He'll take care of it. You're a successful scientist, it goes without saying. My commission... I'll pay you more than what you usually charge. Thank you, sir. But I need a small favor from you. Mr. Seenu! You can even ask for a big favor, Paul, sir. There's something not right about him. He paid in advance and made us do the heavy lifting. He doesn't look like a scientist to me. Rather looks like a weird man. This is what happens when you watch weird films. - Oh, really? - He's a very good man. He looks perfectly like a scientist. - He's going to find a cure for cancer-- - Fine, don't forget our commission. I'll give it. Enough with the rant. Just look, don't mess with the client's things. Where is Aadhi? Hey, Aadhi? Aadhi, come let's go. Aadhi, what are you doing? Hey, Aadhi! What are you doing? - What are you looking at--? - It's nothing, let's go. It's high time you let go of the past. It's been twenty years. Only when we speak about it I realized.... that it's not easy to let go. What are you not able to forget? Nothing, sir. Let's go. What's your connection to that date? Sir, why do you want to know about it? Tell me. 28th March, 1998 - What happened? - My mother's birthday. That was the last day I saw my mother. - How? - Sir, don't bother-- On the next day, she died in an car accident. I need to talk to you. March 28th, accident... What I'm about to say will astonish you. In fact, you may not believe it. But you will have to believe it! Aadhi, do you want to travel back in time? Do you wish to meet your mother again? If I bring back your mother to life, would you be happy? I don't understand. I'm working on an experiment. To invent the time machine... it took me twenty years. Twenty years! The experiment is about time travel. I don't have the strength to do time travel. I want someone else to do it. Aadhi, believe me... in order to save your mother from the accident back in time... I'll help you with it. In return, I need a small favor. Just a small favor. Will you do it? As I'm a scientist, I don't believe in fate. But, Paul meeting Aadhi... is not a coincidence. Aadhi... people normally don't get a second chance in life. Think about it. - Hello. - Hello, sir, my client, NRI. - Dude, what a surprise? - I never knew it was you. Sir, you guys know each other? Yes, Seenu. I know him very well. We're college mates. Raghav Agasthiya! - Come inside. - Hey, where were you all these days? - It's been long. - Yeah, it's been a while. - How are you, son? - Yes, mom, I'm good. Your uncle has got his daughter, Lakshmi engaged. She never calls me. But you're talking about getting engaged. It's not with you, my son. She's engaged to Narayana's son. Her fiance is an Engineering graduate. That's why Lakshmi was avoiding your calls. I warned you to study well. You look exactly like you do in your picture. How do I look? I think your spectacles are a bit different. Yeah, correct. How many times have I seen your picture? My parents like your family a lot. That's why I immediately wanted to meet you. Forget about my parents. Do you like me? Yeah. That's why I wanted to meet you. What do you like about me? Your smile. I really like your smile. No one has ever said that to me. One second, excuse me. - One second. - Yeah, sure. I'm in an urgent meeting. Shall I call you back? Hey, glazed doughnut! First, check your WhatsApp. - Later, continue with the meeting. - Hello, who's this? Hello? Chaitu. Chaitu, please take the sweets. C. Seetha! Chaitanya? Any problem? Dude, can't believe I met you. - One second, excuse me. - Sure. - Seenu, he liked the house. - That's great, sir. Sir, I'll be on my way once you pay my commission. Yeah, okay. - Seenu... - Okay! - He just got back from abroad... - I'm at my friends place... ...and had to spend a lot. - Like a friend... - Sir, are you negotiating? - No-No, Seenu... - All okay? Yeah, I hope so. If you can do something about your commission... I'm used to it now. Had I worn a suit and spoke impeccable English... and produce a invoice with GST, would that work for you, sir? Sir, we both do the same work. You know what's the difference? He's educated and I am not. I'm demanding money for the work I did. "Come on, he's a local guy... he'd be grateful no matter what we pay. Mr. America! It's not enough to speak good English... you need to respect people. To hell with your Chicago Tech! Aadhi! Are you ready? Amplifier, mic test! Hello, hello, 1, 2, 3! I request to you all to be seated and maintain silence. The auditions are about to begin. We would like to call the 1st contestant... Contestant #001 - What's your name? - Aadhi. You're the 1st contestant from Hyderabad. Are you nervous? No... Whenever you are ready. Sorry! Sorry! Aadhi, sing. Aadhi, sing! - Hello! - Bro, are you going to sing or not? Aadhi. Aadhi, stop right there. Aadhi. Aadhi! What happened, Aadhi? Why didn't you sing? - I don't know. - Don't know? - Aadhi, you've been practicing-- - Vaish, don't say anything. I'm going to set aside becoming a musician. - And look for another job. - What other job do you know? You don't know anything beyond music. Tell me! Life doesn't give you a second chance. - Life doesn't give you 2nd chance. - Aadhi, I'm taking to you. Welcome, Aadhi. I knew you'll be back. Before you venture into time travel... you need to know a few things. There are many strange things in this universe... but science is the only definite thing you can believe in. I and Michael... Michael Roy, my partner. But there's an issue with Science. A solution to a question is another question. Once you arrive at a solution, there'll be another question. Once you crack that you're presented with another. There's no end to the questions. That's how it is. But we missed something. Both Michael and I... In fact, everyone... there's an expiry date. Paul we are getting old. In science, there are many things to be discovered... but the time didn't favor us. That's when I realized... time... time is our enemy! Since then all we thought about was time, time, time! In simple words... during that time the solution was... this time machine. - The key to immortality. - Yes! That's how we achieved victory over death. For the project funding... I presented our idea to Indian Science Congress Association. But it was rejected stating it's impossible to complete the project. We decided to do it ourselves and sold our entire property to build the time machine. We spent eight years! Nothing else was on our minds. In order to test the time machine we built... one of us had to volunteer. Michael! Michael, my friend. He chose his destiny! The first test was done on 28th March, 1998. Michael was ready to venture into time travel. But we failed! Our time machine didn't work. Michael... the failure turned him into an alcoholic. That's why, 29th March is the day you cannot forget. Similarly, for me it's the 28th. Use this time machine to travel into the past and save your mother. In return, I want you to save Michael. I want him back. Michael, should return. She left me. She left me for good. It's all because of you guys. Had you guys nagged me into studying, I would've been better. Bloody! You guys studied and graduated with degrees. But left me with nothing. Do you recognize her? - Who? - Seetha. It's pigtail, Seetha. She used to hangout with you all the time during school days. She's looks good. Why don't you get married? Do you recognize him? That's Santhosh. The guy who used to come along with me in the auto to school. He used to always cling on to her. They're getting married. To irritate me, he has sent the wedding card. Had I knew before I would've married her. - Hey! - Enough rambling drunk. What happened to you? Don't bother. That Paul is talking nonsense, don't pay heed to him. Don't believe in that nonsense. I need my mom. I couldn't be able to forget my mother. If someone says he can bring back my mother, how can I refuse it? I'm going to do it. I've decided. Hey, it might happen in English films. Not in reality. You wouldn't speak if you had seen the time machine. Life is giving me one last chance. I'm going to take it. Fine, we'll come too. I'm not going on a vacation. It may or may not work. Even if it works not sure what will happen next. I'm going to save my mother. Why do you want to come? I too want to change my life. - What do you want to change? - His love life! His life, bro! Then you should help me. In 1998... this place would've been a cemetery, or a cinema theater, or a huge lake. It's not a good decision to keep my time machine over here. I... I want to safeguard my Time Machine. To do that I need a safer place. I know just the place, Paul. He needs the time machine to hangout with the girl. You're single and you wouldn't understand. Paul, sir... you please ignore him, but my problem is quite serious. I'm going to educate myself, Paul, sir. That too I'll be right beside him all along. Perhaps I could become successful like you. John Kutta Seenu, the Scientist! Idiot, you're a land broker. You can become only a science broker. - Shut up! - Funny guy! That's me, sir. I'm the handsome one in the picture. Now you are not... This house belongs to my grandfather. In 1996, my grandfather passed away. Since then no one has lived here. I've been maintaining this property. Just me. This house is the right place to keep the time machine. - Seenu. - Sir. Let's start it! Wow! Come on, guys. Come on, fast! Hey, Chaitu, close the door. - One month? - Yes. Sir, can you please tell me where are you going? Don't ask me where. But I will be back in a month. - Love you. - Hello? Hello? - Keep us alive! - Seetha! Come closer. Come! I'm sending you guys back to March 1st, 1998. In that time I and Michael will be present. On 26th March hand over this floppy and picture to me. If you do, I won't test the machine on the 28th. Why on the 26th, sir? Why can't we give it to you once we reach? During that time I was in Delhi. Only on the 26th I'll return to Hyderabad from Delhi. The address I'd be at... my identities, everything will be in this time machine. I'm warning you strictly! This is your only chance to change your fates. This is not child's play. Use it properly. I'm not sure how the consequences will affect your future. We have to wait and see. There are a few rules to follow while using this time machine. Rule #1: It's a to and fro device. Take it you're buying a return train ticket. You can only travel once through the time. No one should even suspect that you're from the future. And remember... it's enough if you scan your eyes to return. Hey, Seenu, what is this? Aadhi, what's happening? Hey, everything is shaking. I think something's happening. I'm going away. Paul, sir, is this okay? Is it working? Tell me, if this is okay? Hey, that old man can't hear us. He's scamming... Oh, no, what's happening? Hey, stop this! Hey, Aadhi! Sir! Paul, is this okay? I can't see anything. Can you guys see anything? Why is no one speaking? I can't see anything! I can't see anything, damn it! Oh, no, my head is spinning. Oh, no, Paul, sir-- Is this okay? Okay? Okay? - Seetha! - Remember boys. Follow the rules. This is the key to immortality. Victory over death! Immortality! Hey, Seenu... Aadhi! Oh, God! Hey, grandpa! Hey, this is my grandfather's house. This is my grandfather's house. That's my family. My grandmothers... - and this is my swing. - Seenu! Seenu! Hey! Seenu, hush! Hey, don't make any noise. No one should know that we're here. Understood? - Does anyone come to this house? - No one does. Hey! Hey, what are you doing? What are we doing here? Let's go. If anyone sees that we're here it'll raise suspicion. - My grandma is from royal family-- - Hey, Seenu! - Is there a back exit to this house? - Yes, that way. - Back! - My great grandfather had two wives. Rajava and Narsava. They were a fun bunch! Chaitu, look at the water tubs. Hey, shall we go out? Akashvaani, Hyderabad center. You're listening to program, Paadipantalu. In today's program we're going to hear... Who are these guys? Why are they looking weirdly? Same fragrance. It's our school! Even now the mention of school gives me shivers. Did we ever participate during the sports day? As far as I know, we never did. I know where we can find ourselves. Rock: Weight 260. Slash! Big Show: Weight 360. Slash! Hey, Chaitu, show me your card. Hey, put your card down. Come on, do it. - Give it to me. - Seenu, please don't do it. What happened? Chaitu... - Who is it? - It's the watchman. - Come on, let's go. - Come on! Instead of playing on the ground on sports day... you boys playing cards. Uncle, watchman uncle, they're not poker cards. It's a sport for children. Really? This is what you call sports for children? Give me your bag! Arrogance! Hey, give me your bag. - Uncle, please don't do it. - Give me the bag! - Uncle! - Hey! - I'm scared! - What do we do now? Don't worry. Hey, get lost. Go! Who are you people? What brings you here? Parents are supposed to wait at the front gate. Sir-- Sir-- - Bag, bag, bag, bag. - Give it to me. - Sir! Sir! - Hold him. Sir, what are you doing? What do you guys want? Why did you take away the bag? Who are you guys? See, there's nothing inside my bag. That's why I didn't succeed in life. Check out my bag. Curd rice and lemon pickle. Sir, what do you want? - You! - Me? How does it matter to you what sports do we play? Don't you feel ashamed for bullying children? Don't call them children. If we don't stop them now... they'll end up doing something wrong in the future. Finally, he spoke something that was true. This is how you used to roll our ears, right? - Sir! - How does it feel now? - Do you think he'll return our bags? - Chaitu... - Come on, say it. - Hey, kids! You hired men to beat me up! Here you go, take your bags. We're looking at ourselves. Card! Look at me, the black sheep. We look very happy. ♪ I want to grow from your Love Of your lap of old days ♪ Mom! ♪ Mother ♪ ♪ Like an Anklet to your feet ♪ ♪ Mother ♪ ♪ My footsteps should follow you ♪ ♪ Mother ♪ ♪ Like an Anklet to your feet ♪ ♪ Mother ♪ ♪ My footsteps should follow you ♪ Ma, do you need any help?

Why don't you eat it? Hey, why are you yelling at him? Don't bully the kid. Brother, look at his arrogance. She's being sweet and offering him. But look at his attitude. I don't like that sweet. What sweet is it? It's pudding. Now a person will come. Give it to him. He'll eat it all. Santhosh! Hey, be careful. You might damage the auto. Sorry! Keep your apology to yourself and don't annoy her. Wow! Pudding! Do you always sit next to that girl? This is my spot! - I will sit here. - Oh, God! It's not like you own the seat. Hey, I'm trying to start the auto. What are you doing questioning the kid? Come on, help me start the auto. Go! - I'll handle him later. - It's delicious. - Come on! - It's easy peasy! In few matters, we grown ups should be strict. - Good morning, sir. - What period is this? Telugu, sir. - Tell me in Telugu. - Hey, Seenu, get up. - Sir, is looking at you. Get up! - Good morning, sir. Good morning, teacher! Sir, are you a teacher? Why? I don't look like a teacher? No! Mocking yourself, is it? You don't need to know who I am. Similarly, I do not need to know you people. It's because I know who is silent and who is noisy. I know who is good and who is troublesome. I know those who are studious and who act like studious. I know it all. Enough with the act. First bench! How much did you score in Telugu? 95, sir! 94, sir! 92, sir! - How much did you score? - 50, sir. 51, sir. Sir, you won't share you scores is it? You prefer to stay silent, is it? He can only tell if he scored anything at all. Hereafter, sir, will start scoring. That's why I am here. For the past 2 years you've been sitting at this back bench. It won't happen anymore. You'll be sitting at the front bench. You'll listen to the teacher. No more drama. You have to do it diligently. And succeed in life. Hey, Vishal! Anyways you're going to handle your father's business. Why do you need to study? Come here and sit. Sit-- Friendship? It's 'cause of you guys he's spoiled. First off, lose their friendship. If you don't, you'll be dependent on them when you grow up. Just to speak in English, you will have to beg to them. Bloody! Get in the front. Shed that arrogance. Just to speak to an NRI in English you throw so much attitude. Quickly take out the books. - If not teacher will scold us. - Yeah, I'm taking it out. Are you playing reed organ is it? You may squeeze all you want, but I know that it's empty. Understood? Good morning, teacher! How many times will you wish me? - Sir? - Who's that? Sir! - Who are you? - I'm the newly appointed, Peon. - What are you doing over here? - Peon? I came to trouble the kids. No, no... I came to control the troublesome kids. Okay. I'll take care of them now. You can leave. Go! Sit down. Sit down. - Please study, child. - Please go. Everyone sit down. Who are you? Ma... - Ma, music... - Aadhi, is that you? I had mentioned about Kutlu taking guitar lessons... that's his teacher. Please come in. Kutlu, Aadhi is here. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Hey, why does he need guitar lessons? It's because on 26th March he has a music competition. Thus the classes. 22nd onwards his unit tests will begin. Are you aware? If he studies well he'll succeed in the future. If not, he'll be going door to door just like him... teaching guitar lessons. Nothing will go wrong by missing just one exam. Moreover, it's just a unit test. When the mother has spoken, who am I to interfere? Everyone sing along, Sa re ga ma pa! Sir, please take a seat. Please serve him coffee. Always harping on the music. Did you finish your homework? I'm sure he'd help you with it! - What competition? - Inter-School cultural event. Cultural event? Aadhi, here you go. - Thanks, Ma! - You don't have to thank me. Not for the coffee but for supporting your son. Did you hear us speak? Since he was a baby he was very keen on music. Just like me. He's a very good singer. My dream is to see him become a successful musician. But he's scared of singing in front of the crowd. That's why you are there for him. What do you say? Kutlu, take out the guitar. Shall we begin? I'll go first! This song is for you. I wrote this song for my mother.

Even if I'm not there you'll sing well. In future, what if I'm not there? I can't be with you always, dear. During my childhood I used to be exactly like you. When no one's around I'll sing my heart out. But when I have to sing in front of the people... I'll be frozen and stunned! That's when my mother gave me this ring. After wearing this ring... I never feared. Mom! I swear I wasn't scared. You know why? Because wearing it made me feel as if my mother was with me. So, whenever you are afraid, keep this in mind... I'll always be with you. Okay? Okay, mom. My Prince! Kutlu, all the best! Love you, mom! Aadhi! Hey, what are you guys doing here? Why aren't you at the exam? It's just few minutes away from the competition to start. I request the students participating in the singing competition... - Excuse me, ma'am. - to please come. Erm... singing competition, Aadhi Ravichandra. Aadhi? One second. If he does not turn up in another five minutes, he can't participate. - He will be here soon... - No, no, no, sorry! Tell me one thing why do you like him so much? There must be something. Come on, tell me. When he smiles he looks good. What do you like about me? I really like your smile. But he never smiles. Somehow he should pass this exam. Brother, I'm getting late for the exam. What's taking him so long? The singing competition is going to start in five minutes. All the students are requested to go in a line. Here you go. Where is he? Where did he go? This is the first time we've bunked class. Earlier, we've never bunked classes. - Hey, did Chaitu come here? - No, what about Seenu? He didn't come. Even Kutlu didn't make it to the competition. Where did they go? The question is not where they went? The question is where we might go? I don't remember going to the competition. - I had a doubt about it. But... - Doubt? What are you looking at? HITLER Dude, Boss film is releasing today. Hey, we have an exam to attend. I have the competition. I'm not coming. No way, Mega Star movie is releasing today! Seenu! Aadhi! Aadhi! Aadhi! - Aadhi. Aadhi. - Aadhi, what happened? - Aadhi... - Aadhi! Brother, this year belongs to you! What are you saying? 2019? Oh, my God, how did this happen? What's happening out here? The kids have traveled to a different time. And we're stuck in this period. They're in 2019... and we're in 98', damn it! Nothing is going to happen now. There's neither going to be Seetha nor Shruthi. Everything has gone for a toss. It's done. We're doomed for life. Hey, Seenu, why are you smiling? What happened? - I've understood it well. - What? Our past is in the future. And our future is in the past. Wow! To hell with your rhyming. How did they switch on the time machine? Eye scanner! They need my eyes... to switch on the machine. That means... Kutlu? But how did the kids find this address? They must've suspected us. Tell me, what did you do so that they suspected us? It's not like... you see.. Hey, Seenu, why is that Peon always targeting you? No idea. But I want to find out. Shall we follow him? Teacher, your smile is enough. I'm delighted! Thank you! Hey! The bell and your belly look the same. Vegetables! Vegetables! Greens! Greens! - Hey! - Isn't this grandpa's house? What is he doing at your grandpa's house? - Is your grandpa not home? - It's been 2 years since he died. Since then no one has lived over here. Now, what do we do? - Seenu! - Hush! - Follow me. - Seenu! The great broker! Hey! I got everything we need. Get here soon. - I'm really scared, dude. - They're inside. - Hey, Seenu. Hey! Hey! - Come with me. Hey, Seenu, get here soon! Did you get the booze? Seenu, do you remember these bottles? - We used to sell empty bottles... - Hey, that's my auto driver. - Yeah, you're right. - Here you go. - Why do you have to drink over here too? - This fellow is impossible. - Give me that. - That's Aadhi's music teacher. - What's he doing here? - Kutlu, you've changed! What are you doing? What's all this? This is what gave us second chance in life. Praying to it is the right thing to do. - No matter where you are... - Seenu! - you'd never change! - What is it? What are they hiding under it? - I met our English teacher today. - Seenu... - Not just you, brother! - Hey! Not sure. But they're up to something. - Hey, don't say stuff like that. - What are you saying? It's wrong. You'll be punished. - This is not why we came here. - Let's find out. Kutlu! All the best! Thanks, mom! Aadhi! Why are you guys here? Didn't you guys attend the exam? Hey, are you serious? You're saying that my music teacher is a terrorist? Yes! Your music teacher. His auto driver and our school peon. They're all terrorists! How do you know? They're planning to do something with a strange machine in the house. Machine? That too, they're at my grandfather's house. Before they could kidnap us, we should find out what that machine is. Find out what? Seenu, how come a terrorist could play guitar? What would they do by kidnapping us? Hey! Seenu! Seenu? Hey, Seenu what are you doing? Hey! What is it? Go ahead! It's a huge machine! Let's get out from here. Hey, Seenu, what are you looking at? I'm checking how to switch on the machine. Why do you want to switch it on? If we switch it on, we'll know what it does. If we touch the red button it will switch on. Hey, Seenu, what if by pressing the red button we kidnap ourselves? Hey, Seenu, don't do it. - How do you know so much? - I learned it from the cinema. Hey, Aadhi! What happened? What happened? Hey! Hey, Seenu... you have switched on the machine. Machine... Hey, Seenu. Seenu... Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Where are we? Hey, this is grandfather's house. But it looks different.

Remember what Paul told us. His house address and the floppy disk are inside that time machine. Finding Paul's house is not important now. Why should we care what happens to him? First, let's find out a way to get out of this mess. We have only one option left to return to our time. The time machine invented by Paul. You should handover this floppy and the picture on the 26th... If you do, on the 28th I will shut down the machine testing. On the 28th Paul will be testing the time machine with Michael. Only if we find Paul... we can save Michael... also we can save the time machine. Sounds good. But we lost Paul's address. - Now what do we do? - It's easy to get an address. You go ahead. Do you remember the area? We're done for. Hey, Paul is a scientist, right? If we look for him at the right place, we'll find him for sure. I should looking for girls in this age... but I'm looking for scientists, damn it! Rangi Kutta Paul and Michael Roy. That's right. Give me a day's time. There are old files at the university store room. - I'll check and let you know. - Please, sir. Okay. You guys, please write down your phone number in this register. - I'll inform you. - Sir, please let us know soon. We're in a hurry. - Once you know, please call us. - Sure. Only then can we return to our time. - Don't worry, we'll find him. - Even if we searched over there... He will be home soon. Aadhi... - Seenu and Chaitu are missing too? - ...since morning, Kutlu has been missing. Did you happen to see him? - I'll be right there. - No, Ma. No idea where he went. I dropped him myself at the auditorium. But they said he never made it to the competition. Neither he went to school. Aadhi, I'm petrified! - What is it? - You're the reason for everything. I told you a million times not to make him pursue music. You never listened! Get lost! Aadhi, could you please go with him? Please!

Come on, let's eat. Even the Police are not able to find him. Where's Kutlu? And no idea what happened to him? I'm scared something might happen to her. She has not even drank water for the past 2 days. Aadhi, could you please speak to her? Wow! Thanks, mom. Today is my mother's birthday. On every birthday I'll be the first one to wish my mother. But now... Our parents must be looking for us. Hey, think hard! That machine has transported us to 2019 from 1998. If we calculate... One, two... - 21 years. - Correct! That means our parents are here too. Only difference is they're old. Hey, it's like watching a movie. Hey, what exactly do you guys wanna eat? Fine, tell me what can I get you? Brother, the dish you served us the last time, do you have it? It's available. Do you have money? We have money brother. We're hungry. Please make it fast. Hey, Aadhi. Hey, Aadhi! - Aadhi! - Hey! Hey, kids! Hey, what are you looking at? Hey, it's the music teacher. Hey, he seems like he time traveled too. Brother, where is this happening? Ma, Kutlu, made this gift a surprise for you. When Kutlu was inside my womb... I used to sing this song every day. Since his birth... every day without listening to this song, he never goes to bed. Maybe it's because of this song he took an interest in music. See, he played his guitar and composed a song... to surprise me on my birthday. But he's not here to wish me. Ma, please don't worry. Nothing will happen to Kutlu. Since childhood, he has never mingled with anyone. If guests arrive... he goes straight to his room. Weddings, functions or any kind of public gathering... he's never comfortable around these events. All his teachers... used to say that he has social anxiety problems. But I never believed them. But for some reason I was scared. If Kutlu stays the same... how's he going to face anything in his life? One day... I heard him... singing. His song had magic. For the first time I saw Kutlu very confident. That's when I realized... music is his strength. If he pursued music... I believed he'll lead a happy life. That's why I kept encouraging him to pursue music. Until now, not even for a day Kutlu and I have been apart. Kutlu can't be without me. He won't be there, Aadhi. When he was going to the competition he asked me to come along. I should've gone with him. I made a mistake, Aadhi. I made a mistake. Your Kutlu didn't go anywhere, he's right in front of your eyes-- I will bring him in front of you eyes. I promise you, Ma. Happy birthday, mom! Sister! Auditions on the left. Congrats, man. - When is the bachelor's party? - Thank you. Thank you. - Don't forget to bring me a gift. - Okay. Hey, this is my school uniform. So, you came for auditions in your uniform. Uncle, we need to meet our music teacher. His name is, Aadhi. I saw him in this competition. Hey, it's been a month since the senior's auditions. It's not possible to meet him. - Why do you want to meet him? - Uncle! - May I have some sweets? - Sure. One, two, three, four... Hey, that's enough! Uncle, shall I? I just need one, uncle. - Uncle, is it your birthday? - No, no, I'm getting married. Oh! Uncle, what about the competition? Seetha! Over here. It's the pig tail Seetha. Both are girls are the same. It's important get this in your head. Hey, Seetha, look, this is our school uniform. His face looks familiar, right? Hey, what's your name? Chaitu, is my new hairstyle looking good? - Please, please, please, please... - I don't want! Santhosh! I'll be back. Chaitu? - You could've given it to me. - Hey, Chaitu! Chaitu, hold on. - What happened? - Chaitu, what happened? I knew that sister from before. What are you saying? One day my auto driver showed me that sister's picture. The pigtail Seetha when grows up will look exactly like her. - What's her name? - Seetha. - What's his name? - Santhosh. Santhosh and Seetha used to travel with me in the auto. They're from our school. Your grandpa's house looks different. And we can't find our houses. Seetha and Santhosh are going to get married. And that broken time machine doesn't turn on. What do we do now? Three school kids have been kidnapped... the police suspect that the kidnappers fled to Kerala. The kidnappers arrived disguised as auto driver and school peon. And have kidnapped the kids by intoxicating them. I think our current situation points to the prison. There's a reward of 4000 rupees for the people who can find them. How can someone file a case for kidnapping themselves? Damn it! Regardless of the situation... - Why did he come here? - Hey, Aadhi. Any news on Paul? Why did you come? You should be with mom. It's been 2 days since mom ate anything. She didn't even drink water. I promised to bring back Kutlu. Somehow we have to find, Paul. - Hey, our news is in the newspapers-- - Hey! Good morning! Sir... Here you go! Rangi Kutta Paul's file. Sir, we said it's an emergency. - At least you could've called. - You could have. How may I supposed to call? - You gave me an international number? - International? What was it? - I think it said, Io or something... - Seenu Jio! Sorry, in a hurry I gave this number. Sir, what kind of number is this Jio? Twenty years later, you will come to know about it. - I really doubt he knows anything. - Delhi? - Sir, what did you say? - Nothing sir. - Sir, this file has his Delhi address. - Delhi? This is the only file on Rangi Kutta Paul. I'm sorry. Where are you? My legs are hurting. - Mine too. - Let's rest for a while. Who is this sister? Sister, who are you? First off, tell me, who are you guys? Seenu. Chaitu. Aadhi. Aadhi? No, no, no, no, no! It's just a dream. Just a dream. Sister. Oh, shit, shit, shit! Okay. What happened, sister? Hey, you please stop calling me, sister. How does your mother call you? Kutlu! Kutlu? Hello, who are you? Sir, I'm talking to you. What are you doing in this house? Hello? I should be asking you that. Excuse me, sir. I'm speaking to you. Sir... I'm talking to you. Sir, is there a problem? In life everyone has problems. Sir, our life itself is a problem. Sir, it's us who create our own problems. If we're not able to get rid of problems, that lies with us too. In fact... everything is over here. You mean in your nutshell? If there's a problem, let it be. In fact, if there's no problem... it would be like it was never there. Sir, try to joke around to break the tension. Your problems will be resolved in no time. What should we do? Close your eyes. Keep your heart happy. Clear your mind. Pick a positive thought for your problem. Positive thought... Sir, I meant to say think about good things. How can I think about good things? I have no education. He lost his girl. What do you say, Chaitu? Fine, let me give it a try. Kutlu can't be without me. I'll bring him in front of your eyes. I promise! Bloody... Sir, one minute. I wonder why they drive cars. No road sense. Wait and watch what I do to you. Hey, not enough that you drive a big car. - You need to know how to drive. - Hey, Aadhi. Step out of the car. - I said step out. - Hey, where is he going? Aadhi, we don't have time for this. Come back, Aadhi. - I think everyone closed their eyes. - You rich men... always drive off-road. I'm sending you people to March 1st, 1998. You'll find Michael out there and me. I want him back. Michael should return. Hey, I said stop! - Bloody.... - Hey-hey, Michael. Michael! Brother, hurry up! Please follow that car. Hey, that was Michael. Let's follow him. - Hey, are you sure it was him? - Brother, hurry up! - Hurry up! Start the vehicle. - Yeah, doing it! Why did you knock him over now? - Drive faster. - Brother follow him. Fast! Fast! Fast! Brother, please drive faster. Come on keep following them. - Come on drive faster. - I have a doubt. Why are we chasing them? Sir, he's our problem, sir. Sir, come on faster. - Now watch me drive. - Woah! Faster, sir. That's about it. Idiots! Brother, drive faster. - Please faster. - That's a Benz and mine's a Kenz. You're great. Please drive faster. Brother, please drive faster. - Brother, speed up. - Brother, come on. He's driving faster. Oh, God, we lost him. We lost him. I can't see the car. Hey, he's right there. - Hey, - Finally, we caught up to him. - Your problem has been stopped. - Hey, there's a check-post. It's the police. I'll say that my father works as a clerk for the Chief Minister. Why don't you say that your grandfather is a politician? Sir, don't get worked up. I have all the documents in order. - Is everything in order? - All okay, sir. Okay, sir, you can leave. A car arriving behind has been following me for a very long time. - Please check on them. - I'll check you can leave. Keep it moving. - Don't worry, sir. - Hey, get over here! Police are our friends. Hello, sir, how are you? Passenger, sir. Why are you guys silent? Speak up! - Open the boot. - Boot? - Why do you want check, sir? - Hello, sir. I was told that you were following the car in the front. - No, sir. - No, sir, we weren't. We never saw the car in the front. It's just that we wanted to take a closer look... Oh, is it? So, you book taxi to follow cars? It's not like that, sir. Step out of the car. - Why sir? - Step out of the car, damn it! - Where are coming from? - From Hyderabad? - Do you know them? - No. They're just passengers. - Why were you driving fast? - Nothing in particular. This is the first time. - Where are you from? - Hey! - Sir? - What are you looking at? - Do you know them? - What is your name? - Sir, why so many questions? - Aadhi - We're getting late. - I'm a music teacher. Auto-- mobiles... - Auto, auto... - Auto driver? I do sales at automobile shop. If you come into the town ask for taxi-driver, Shankar. I'm very famous! - He's my assistant. - My taxi is famous too.

Despite knowing it all, we couldn't change anything from the past. We made a mistake. We made a huge mistake. Where were you Kutlu? Mother is not at home. Only her photo is inside the house. All these years... I only spoke in front of mom's picture. If you look at her... she'll be smiling all the time. I had a doubt, if she understood me or not. I never got to explain it to her. Your mom took good care of you. I too will take good care of you. Who are you? My name is Vaishnavi. I... You will eventually know me. Us coming over here and having a good time with mom. Once again to have fed by mom. The song I composed. And her listening to my song. This didn't happen on its own. But mom made it all happen... ...for me! She looked at me before the accident. Like a picture, without blinking her eyes. With that same smile... for one last time, she called me, Kutlu... Kids, only you three have seen the future first hand. It's not because of astrology... but science! Use it for good. Okay! - We are as in... we're you! - We know that. When I get home, will I find my mother? She'll be there, Kutlu. Mom will be there. Hereafter, for every moment... mom will be with you. How? Music! Mom, loves music, right? If we embrace the music... mom will be with us too. Do you understand? Won't we get a girl similar to Seetha? - We got her! - Really? How does she look? Is she beautiful? Height? Is she tall? Hey, it's better to curb the over-expectations. That's why despite trying we didn't get married. Chaitu, please don't lose that smile. That's our great quality. We have just one life. Live it to fullest. I should study is it? If I study, our future will be bright. Sorry! Whenever you asked me study I didn't take it seriously. Tomorrow onwards, I'll take books to school. I'll sit at first bench. I'll listen to whatever the teacher says. Yea, right! You can't succeed when you're not good at something. You be yourself and enjoy your life. Brat! So, what if we're not educated. We have talent to compensate. Yeah, right! What talent do we have? When I gave you the question paper... instead of passing the exam... you found an opportunity to make money of it. That's the talent you posses. Oh, that's a talent, is it? - You mocked me earlier, didn't you? - No I didn't. Bloody, brat, I knew you did. Sorry. Did you meet your mother? Paul, you gave us a second chance that even God doesn't. Once we witnessed the past we tried to change it. But we couldn't. Aadhi, where did you go? You never said anything, I didn't know what to do. That's when I realized... each and every moment is precious. All this while I didn't understand you. I may travel once again through time. It's me, sir. Real Estate broker, Seenu. Okay, sir. - But fate can't be changed. - Sir, I have an amazing farm house 2 kms down the airport. Take off and landing will happen right next to the bungalow. You can watch from the terrace. I'm a little weak in English, sir. But I'm very strong in Telugu. Okay, sir, I'll be there. - Hi... - What? What are you here for? I am... I am really sorry. Just one minute. Have you gone mad? Why are you smiling now? You like my smile, right. That's why. Shruthi, Chaitanya's family called... - Shall we go inside and talk? - The boy likes you. - He wants to come home and talk. - Come in.
