[clock ticking] [woman sobbing] [woman sobbing uncontrollably] [slurping loudly] [woman continues to sob] Er... Oh. [woman continues to sob] [woman wailing in despair] [mouths] Now, we didn't find Brendan, but we... We did find this. It was down at the dock. [woman sobbing and wailing] That's his! Yep. Oh, my God. Okay. Well, we'd better head back to HQ. We've got a very busy day planned. Yeah, fighting crime and whatnot, so... Shall I? Shouldn't leave that half-eaten. Should I... - Take that, yeah. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Wait. What? But... So what do I do now? Well, what you don't do is call the office. Yeah, it's getting pretty stressy down there, so I wouldn't bother. Here's our direct line. Nice to meet you, Annie. Anna. Cool. Congratulations, Brendan. You're a free man. Get down. - You're taking me to the airport, right? - I'm not a taxi service. - But... - Get out, man! - Get out. - Out! Bye, dickhead! - Hello. Breaker Upperers. - Hello. Breaker Upperers. You wanna be single by March? Consider it done. I've had it up to... I've had it past here, I've had it up to here. Just because we got gay marriage doesn't mean we need to... follow through, you know? I didn't vote for it. - Will you support this marriage? - [guests] We will! - We will not! - [gasps] You weren't gay eight months ago, Russell! It's simple, really. What we do is we take unhappy couples such as yourself and consciously, forcibly and irreversibly uncouple you. Whoa. What the hell, David? After the job is done, you don't know us, we don't know you. - Thank you so much. - You're a free man, David. Sarah, I think we need to talk about Jarrod. The spark has gone. We used to play "refugee trying to find asylum." I'd be the refugee, obviously, and she'd be a sexy UN case manager. We don't do that any more. - [continuous beep] - [woman sobbing] I want whips, I want chains. I want A Hundred Shades of Grey. He's not even one. 'Cause women are scary. I mean, they say they're the fairer sex. Sure, if you go around with the devil. Why are you doing this, Sharon? Get away from me, evil woman! I've even entered a relationship with my neighbour Raewyn. I moved in with her for three months. But, you know, he's just not getting the message. Kathy! - [dog barks] - [blows whistle] Let's give it another ten minutes and call it quits? Kathy! I want a nice, clean break. I don't want years of heartache and stalking and therapy and possible violence. [shouting aggressively] - I've been shot! - [toy recording of gunfire] It wouldn't take much... to knock the old bugger off. [both] We don't kill people. We're not breaking any laws, Joseph. We're simply guiding two souls towards inevitability. [tires screech] Go! I will shoot your faces. Go! Thank you. - That's good. - That's really good. It's mine! [both laughing] [vacuum cleaner whirring] [woman] Yeah, he's saying that he didn't appreciate you talking to your friends about his vasectomy. But... No... No, I'm not saying you shouldn't talk to your friends. No. That's not what I'm saying. I think you should talk to your friends. I think it's good to... talk to your friends about your emotional state... I'm actually just reading from a piece of paper, but... Lady, he doesn't wanna be with you anymore, so suck it up and move on. Yep. OK. What I would suggest is popping down to your local stationery store, buying yourself a journal and write some tear-jerking diary entries. Thank you for your call. [disconnected tone] - You are so good at that. - Just gotta find the fun in it, you know? [door opens] We order a courier? Hi. Sorry. I'm Jordan. I've got an appointment with you guys. Oh, sorry, Jordan. I was expecting someone older and whiter. I thought you were white. Doesn't matter, though. I don't see color. I mean, I do see color. There's nothing wrong with my vision. Come in. Have a seat. That's Jodie, our intern. You can just ignore her. I'm Jen and this is Mel. - Hey, Mel. - Hi. Shower in a can. - So... - Mel, is that short for Melon? - Melanie. - French? I don't think so. - Really? - Maybe. Anything else you guys wanna catch up on? Favourite food? Music? Movies? Yeah. So, what's your favourite food, music and movies? Lasagna, hip-hop and The Last Of The Mohicans. You don't listen to hip-hop. Yeah, I do, and I've got a CD of it. So, Jordan, how can we help? I wanna break up with my missus, miss. Okay. And how long have you and your missus been together? - Since high school, miss. - You don't have to call me miss. - Just call me Jen. - Okay, miss. And have you attempted breaking up with her before, Jordan? Yeah, a couple of times. See here, I sent her broken hearts and crying faces, which obviously represents sadness and heartbreak. And then she sent this back. [recorded voice] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! And I just couldn't go through with it. Well, we could do a phone call, spell it out. Yeah, I don't think that'll work. She's very delicate. Delicate like a delicate flower, but very persuasive like a persuasive... flower. Okay. Well, maybe we could do something in person. We could do the Other Woman package. I could pretend to be your girlfriend. Sorry, Jen, I don't mean to offend you, but it's more that there's a natural chemistry between Melon and I. She's 35. - 36, actually. - No, you're lying. You're not. Your skin's amazing. - What product do you use? - Just... Okay, fine. Well, it's $500 up front and $500 at the end of the job. Do you think this is something that you could afford? [snorts] Easy. Chump change. [sighs] Yeah. You like that? Yeah, it's all right. - Are you bored? - What? No. - You seem bored. - No. Just thinking about somebody else. [woman] Come on! Wake up, Mel! Wake up! Are you a pussy who hates her life choices? [Mel] No! [woman] "My life sucks. My boyfriend left me for some fat-arsed bitch who's great in the kitchen!" Fire up, Mel! Fire up! - Let's get that bra off. - No, bra stays on. Bra stays on. I took my T-shirt off. [woman] Are you a loser? You're a pussy! Loser! No mates! Hit me! [Mel] You keep hitting me! Can you look at me, please? Not like that. I like to feel a connection of some kind. You're literally inside me. I mean on a human level. If you want "human," you shouldn't be on Tinder. If you wanna work out, you should go to the gym. I don't like gyms. I don't like people. Free shot! Go! [Mel panting and wheezing] Harder! Put everything into it or I'm gonna knee you in the head. Get up. Okay. - Don't go yet. - I'll go when I want to. - Don't go yet. - I'm gonna do it now. - Dude, I'm starving. Oh... - [bed squeaking] [Jen] I'll just be a sec. Wait. No! Not yet! Aargh! [Jen groans] [Mel vocalizing indistinctly] I'm not wearing any undies. - Come on. Guess the singer. Go on. - [vocalizes indistinctly] Prince. - No. - Kermit. - No! - I give up. - It's Celine Dion. - You sound like a seal being strangled. - [message alert] - She sounds like that. I love her. Hey, that Tuesday job's been confirmed. Good. Man, I hate doing missing person jobs. Yeah, they pay the best. Yeah, but they cry all the time, and doesn't that lady have kids? I don't know. Okay. My turn. [animalistic grunting] What the fuck is that? It's a seal. It's Guess the Singer. The game is called Guess the Singer, not Guess the Animal. Okay. Seal, the singer. Butterfly kick! Have you washed these? No. Why would I? - I've only worn them once today. - Oh, God. - [buzzing] - Hey! Food time! Hurry up! No. Don't go on the lawns. Dad just did them. Okay. Wow. Your mum's got some new... art. Oh, my God... [Mel] Whoa! I forgot you had a perm. I thought about making a curry and then I thought, "Oh, God, no. I'm still a novice in that department." So I got Sarina, our cleaner, to make it. Mel hates curry. - No. - But I thought you were Indian. I'm half Indian and half Irish. [Indian/Irish accent] I'm a curry potato. White people love that joke. I don't understand why you would blow up a photo of my ex-boyfriend, print it on corrugated iron and stick it to your wall. Oh, here we go. Because it is art, Jennifer. It's Kiwiana, which is very de rigueur. - Don't use that accent, mum. - It's the correct accent. - I really liked it, Shoz. - Merci beaucoup. I'm, like, 24 in that photo. Why don't you blow up a photo of Stan with that bung-eyed chick he took to the high school social and put that up? Because Stan is married with three children now. If you get a new partner, that's fine. Give me a photo. I'll bung it up on the wall. Why do you have to have a photo of me with a man? Why can't you just have a photo of me in front of a building or a tree? Because I don't want to feel sad every time that I walk up and down my own hallway. Christ, Jennifer, you're 40. When are you going to start making an effort? Look, Jennifer, I think your mother's just worried that time might be running out. - For what? - For you to become a mother. [Stan] Kids are pretty great. You hate your kids. No. It's... One of them. Jennifer, all I'm saying is there are many options for you and Mel to start a family. What? Just because I don't have a boyfriend does not mean I am gay. I'm just saying you already live together. You might want to consider it. I'm not sure it's something you can actually consider, Shoz. I think it's more like something you're born with, like... Like a genetic mutation, like X-Men, but, like, in vaginas. Like, boom! Vulvarine! We think it would be nice if Stan donated some of his sperm so that you could start a family... - What? - That's incest, Mum! No. Not if he inserts it into Mel. - I've gotta go to the bathroom. - Yeah, I've gotta check a thing... Me too, have to check the thing, so... [toilet flushing] You reek of sex. Yeah, you reek of not getting any. [sniffs] [pained groan] Christ! That shit is horrible! - Tastes like air freshener! - Aargh! [Shona] Jennifer, you'd better not be partaking in my cocaine. Jesus Christ, Mum, what is this shit? Ajax? Where did you get it? [Shona] I don't know. Graham, where did you get the cocaine? Oh, no! I don't want my septum to fall out. Why keep doing it if it hurts your face so much? Because I hate my life! [sniffs] Aargh! [Shona] Graham says he hasn't bought any cocaine, so that will be Ajax. Oh, my God! Now is probably not the best time to tell you this, but... Joe's back. How do you know? I sold him a house. You sold him a house and you didn't tell me? Or me? Or her, but more importantly, me! Well, maybe equally as important, me? Jen, please, don't freak out. Not freaking out. I'm cool. I'm fine. You're bleeding from the nose. Oh, shit. Jen. Jen? What's happening? I don't... She's having a flashback? - Mwah! - Call me if you get a chance. - Well, I'm out on the rig, so... - I know, but if you get a chance. - I will. - I will if I get a chance, Jen. You just stay out of trouble, you, okay? [romantic song playing in Japanese] - Okay. See ya. - Yep. Aah! I love you. Welcome home, sex bag. My gum. Come on. Go, baby, go. [Mel] Man, Joe was a cocksucker. [Jen] Total cocksucker. [Mel] Grandmaster cocksucker. Not in a good way. Maybe I should go gay. Man, you bang a lot of dudes. Yes, I do. How many dudes have you banged? More dudes than I have women, just. But the women I did bang, I banged them more often so not sure how that works out. Mm-hmm. - Do I talk about being bi too much? - You talk too much. [Mel] Hey, lady! Hey, I wouldn't walk down this way. There's a couple of creepy dudes back there. I'd stick to the street, I reckon. The well lit street. [woman] Okay. Thank you. [Mel] No worries. Nice doggie. Do you find Kristen Stewart hot? Who's Kristen Stewart? No. You're not gay. Okay. What did you think about that, then? - Yeah, I didn't mind it, but... - Nah. It felt a bit unnatural. Yeah. I didn't get anything happening down there at all. - I don't feel like I need to do it again. - No activation. Not a throb. - Not one. - Okay, don't go on about it. - Not one slither of... - Okay, don't go on about it. - Not one... - Don't. Enough. Droplet of... [Jen] Enough. [Mel] Not a droplet. [Jen] Do you think Joe's still a cocksucker? [man] So, yeah, just put that... [laughs] - Thought you were taking me out to lunch. - What? Have that. [Stan] Can we please go? [Jen] No, I wanna watch him for a couple of minutes. Please, okay? It's not all about you. You're sick. You know that. You need help. He treated you like shit. He just bought you jewellery and clothes the whole time. - He totally objectified you. - Yeah, I liked it. - Is he married? - Yep. - Children? - Yeah. Three. Three! [Stan] Sarah, Michelle and Danny. [Jen] Okay, I don't need to know their names. Did he ask about me? [Stan] I've gotta go. I've gotta get back to the office. Hey, stay low. - [whistle blows] - [cheering] [instrumental hip-hop music playing] The kid's text says: "GF...", which I assume means girlfriend, "...is standing by the subs". What's "subs"? Subs is the substitutes. The players not on the field. [music slows and distorts] Have you spotted her yet? [music slows further] [echoing] Mel. Mel. Hot. - What? - What? - Sepa. - Jordan. No, the girlfriend. Have you spotted her yet? [woman] Smash 'em, babe. Go, Jordan! Fuck 'em up, baby. Fuck 'em up. Ooh! Okay, braids. Twelve o'clock. [woman] That's the way! Shut 'em down! Put 'em on the ground! I would not describe that as a delicate flower, Jordan. Okay. Hey, Mel. You look different. But you look nice, though. You look nice. I like it. It's just a costume. Did you see any of the game? I got a try. Did you see it? I signed your name. [chants] M-E-L-O-N. Melon! E! Hey, you know that when we do the job that I have to do all the talking? Remember? Yeah, of course. But before you do do the job, can I please say one thing? - Okay. - Well, we're all animals, right? Well, in the animal kingdom, there are no rules. So if a... lion and a panda bear wanna make love, they just... The magic just happens. They let it happen. People may frown upon it, but to the lion and the panda bear, it's all natural. It's chemicals, Mel. And... Melon... I know you feel the chemicals too. ...the fuck, Jordan? Is this the bitch you've been secretly texting? This better be a fucking joke. - This better be Candid Camera. - That hasn't been a show since the '90s. I don't even know how you know that ref... Do not talk to me, white girl. - Okay, I'm not white... - Sepa, babe. I didn't mean to do this. I didn't mean to fall in love. The heart just goes where the heart goes. No harsh feelings? [Sepa] What the fuck is going on, Jordan? - I can tell you. - Well... Well, this is Mel and we are in love. - We are in love. - Hang on a second. Oh! Are you telling me that you're leaving this... this fine piece of Maori, Samoan, German, Jewish, Tokelauan arse for this ugly old curry-muncher slut? - Okay, you called me white before... - Hey, don't you dare talk to her like... Oh shit! Don't push her! I don't want anything to happen to her in her condition. What... [whispers] What the fuck? [whispers] Go with it. Tell her, honey. Tell her. - I... - She's pregnant. It's twins. ...the fuck? We did IVF 'cause her eggs are a bit older. Are you telling me that you didn't even accidentally knock up this old bag of shit, but you got your jizz, and you put it in a little fucking petri dish, and you made it swim around her little raisiny eggs until they fertilized and then you syringed them back up her wrinkly grey-pubed twat? - You don't know that my pubes are grey. - Yeah, we did exactly that. And we're moving to the Gold Coast too, 'cause I got a million-dollar contract with the Titans. - [all chuckle] - The Titans. Pull it back. Is this some, like, MTV Punk'd-type shit? What about everything we've been through together? All the times that I drove you to rugby? All the times that I read you Harry Potter one, two, three, four, five, six, seven because of your bad dyslexia? All the times that we played Dragon Ball Z? Ka-me-ha-me... ha. Does that mean nothing to you? Babe, I've been trying to break up with you for the past couple of months. That emoji text? How the hell was I supposed to understand your emoji text? I agree. That could have been quite confusing. Who the fuck are you? This is my mum. That is not your mum. I know your mum. She's not a white bitch. She's Maori. That's racist. Don't you talk to me about color or race, you colonializing bitches! Okay, what Jordan is trying to say is that he no longer wants to be in a relationship with you. So my suggestion is you take that information like a woman. We shake hands, say our goodbyes, and we walk away with our integrity and our faces intact. What do you say? You'd better run! You better run for your life! She punched me. [speech slowed and distorted] [Mel] Holy crap! Run! Jordan, I told you to let me do the talking! Get her! Shit! Drive! Go! [woman] Open the door! What the fuck, Mel? - It's not my fault that he went rogue! - Guys, talk to me, not about me. If it's not your fault, whose fault is it? This is a $200 skirt, Mel. I don't know why you spent that on that skirt anyway. [repeatedly toots horn] Jen, it's a stop sign! Okay? Everyone has to stop at a stop sign. That's why it says "stop." Okay. Let's all take a deep breath. [inhales and exhales deeply] And we'll talk about this like adults. Oh, also, can you take me to Mangere, please? I ran out of credit, so I can't text my mum. Okay, fuck this. I'm getting a cab. - Jen... - See you at home. What? Jen, come on. Jen! Hey, I'm sorry I messed up back there, Melon. I just... had to speak my truth, which in this case was all lies, but all of these emoticons just flowed up inside of me. You do that to me, Melon. Like, you make me feel all these emoticons and it just... makes me wanna... [grunts] Makes you wanna what? [grunts] All I am saying is mixing with clients is gonna get messy. And don't forget our number one rule - DFTC. What's DFTC? DFTC: don't fuck the client. That's a new rule. Why do we need a new rule? I don't know. You know, to keep ourselves safe. - From what? - From complications, STls. I don't know, Mel. - Shit, what's her name again? - Sheree. [country and western style] ♪ Sheree don't wanna ♪ ♪ Be with you no more ♪ ♪ Sheree don't wanna be with you no more ♪ ♪ Sheree don't wanna be with you no more ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Jeff, it's over ♪ [blows harmonica] I just don't think we should do any more jobs with horny teenagers, you know? What? [Mel] You know, I can't help that people are drawn to me. - [Jen] No, you can't. - Like cats. I'm allergic to them, but does that stop them from coming up to... It's not like... I don't put any vibe out to cats. Cats are just like, "Mmm!" I'm a real pussy magnet. I just don't have a good feeling about it. Call it women's intuition, okay? Constable Woods? Annie. - Anna. - Anna. Anna... You remember Constable Glen, right? Jen Glen? You introduced yourself as Constable Green. Yeah. It's my maiden name. Yeah, all of her family have names that rhyme with Glen. So her mum's name is Gwen, brother is Ben, and dad is... Glen. Glen Glen. Yeah. Ooh! I forgot to give him that birthday present. He's gonna be so mad at me. - He wanted fishing stuff. - Yeah. Maybe we should head down to the fishing tackle... - Hey, how are you? - ...shop. [sobs] Fine, yeah. I've been putting up some flyers. But I'm not well, to be honest. I have vulvovaginitis. Oh, it sounds fancy, but it's just a commonplace yeast infection. The doctor thinks it's grief related. I have to wear maxi pads, so I had to throw out my handbag. But I've got this reusable shopping bag so that I can fit them. It's good for the environment. It was nice to bump into you, but... I've been trying to get a hold of you. Is there any news? [both] Um... - Not yet. - Nothing? I've just been waiting. I haven't heard anything either. I haven't got any friends. Brendan was it. I really wanted a baby. But then I was diagnosed with severe endometriosis, so the universe kind of took it out of my hands, that decision. It's okay. It's fine. Have you been to hospital? I quite like it. People there. At any time, I could just press a button, and then someone will come in the door and go, "How are you?" I mean, I've had a deep sense of loneliness since I was a child. Oh, my God! You guys have each other, which is... Must be really great. Is that good? What's that like? [sobs] I'm so sorry. The Crayfish Orgy. [sobs uncontrollably] - Bon appétit. - Merci. Anna. Would some seafood cheer you up a little bit? - Me? - Yeah. Me, I see food, I eat it. Why don't you just hang out with us for a bit? [synth music plays] Woo! Shamone! - Drinking is good. - Oh! I still feel dead inside but it's like the more I drink, the more I forget how dead I feel. - Yeah. - That's why we do it. - Do you guys have husbands? - No. I was a practising bisexual. - Yeah. - Are you a bisexual, Jen? - Uh-uh. - But I'm kind of celibate now. - Celibate? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Me and Jen made a pact. - Well, it wasn't a pact. - Yeah, it was a pact. Emotional attachment is just, like, not our thing. But it's not sad, 'cause I have a very... I have a very extensive wank bank. What's a wank bank? - You've never heard of a wank bank? - No. Okay. It's like a bank in your mind of, like, images of people that get you off. Like, I just think of old Bruce Springsteen running on a beach. Whoo! Got some activation down there, you know. You just scan anyone, scan a room. I mean, maybe there's consensual issues there, but anyway... You look at them. They don't even know. And you're just like, "You're in." - You're in. - You guys are in. - You're in. - You're in. - They don't even know. - No. Really. Because who knows how to fuck yourself better than yourself? - Am I right? - Yes! Yeah! Do you have a wank bank, Jen? No. I live in reality. I just bang dudes. - Another round. - Yes. More tequila. - What? - These are terrible. - Check that out. - I don't know. He does capoeira. Is it fighting or is it dancing? She asked if I'd help put some up. What did you say? I said, "Yeah." Are you insane? Brendan is not missing, and we don't want anyone to find him. But that's what friends do. Friends help each other out... - You're not friends. She's pathetic. - [chanting at bar] Yeah! Number one... in the wank bank. Come on. You were exactly the same when Joe left. [scoffs] - What? - I'm just being nice, Jen, you know? I'm going to the bathroom and then we are leaving. - I got one. - ♪ Ayyy-oh! ♪ ♪ Ayyy-oh! ♪ ♪ Daylight come ♪ ♪ And me wanna go home ♪ [man over PA] Hey, you horny hens! All aboard the party bus.

Well, okay. So thingummy went for a walk in the bush and hasn't returned. What's... - What's her name? - Trudy. - Trudy. - Trudy Stallone. Whoa! - Just gonna... - What are we doing? Why are we here? ...make sure that Anna is okay. - Are you crazy? - Yep. - Fine. Just be back in a sec. - Mel, just leave her alone. - No. - Mel, we don't do follow-up care! - Mel? - Hey. Just wanted to check that your head was all right. Oh... it's just a bit scorched, but fine. Not as bad as the pole burn. I looked for you. I was a bit concussed. I couldn't find you, you probably... Yeah, Jen... What a drag. She wanted to get home. I was having a great time. Would you like to come in? I've got vodka. - Nah. I better not. - I don't think I should be here alone. I used to have a cat, but it died. I think. I can't find it. You know what? I don't... I was just doing a routine check, really. You know, just procedure and so on and so forth and henceforth. I should probably get back to the station. Can I come? Huh? If I start crying, you won't even notice, I promise. [sobs quietly] See? It's barely audible. Er... I'll just get my vodka. [door closes] Hi, Jen Glen. Fuck. [starts engine] [whispers] What? She looked like she was going to kill herself. - Did she say that? - No. But I was picking up a vibe. She looked like she was gonna do something to herself. Is this your work car? Yeah. We just... We do a lot of undercover stuff. Oh, erm... Yeah, we just actually busted a big drugs case. We confiscated that. We were trying to lock up that bong for a long time. That was a big win for us, wasn't it, Constable Glen? Huge win. Now, where is that police station? It's just up here on the right, isn't it? Yep. So, this is the police station. We've got a couple of cops out the front, we've got a couple of palm trees, we've got a rubbish bin at the entrance. But we're actually heading back out on the beat today... I'd love to look at Brendan's file, just quickly. Anna, no. We shouldn't... At least let me go first, 'cause I've got the swipey. Yeah. So we've got a reception area, we've got some disabled toilets, we've got a bell, we've got these guys. Hey, Jill. But nothing really much to see, so we'll probably just head... Actually, why don't we check out the hallway? So, which one is your office? Um... It's just down here, actually. If we go up... It's back. What am I thinking? It's just like a bloody rabbit warren in here. Hey, Tony. - That's Officer Tony. - Yeah, Dirty Tony. Fingered me at the office Christmas party last year twice. Here we are... Hi, guys. Don't recognize those guys. They must be new. Yeah. Here we are. The office. Have a seat. It'll be a bit boring for you, sorry. Just paperwork. Hmm. How boring. Can I see Brendan's file now? Yeah. Constable Glen, do you want to get Brendan's file for Anna? Yeah. Brendan's file. It's called Lock Docs, but it's just a code... name. [door opens] What's going on? Who the hell are you guys? - Constable Wood, Jen. I'm Glen. - Glen... Green. - Just here from the... - Wood. - The... - Yeah. - What's with those uniforms? - We're from Mosgiel. South Island.

It's a service. We're service providers. What you're doing is corrupt. If by corrupt, you mean, helping liberate people from dysfunctional relationships, sure. You work for weak arseholes who don't have the guts to talk to their partners. Anna, your relationship wasn't working. How would you know? Think about it like a big tree that's blocking out the light. You could either stand by and watch that tree die of natural causes over about 200 years... - I think you're horrible. - Yeah, well, I don't like your hair! Look, I think what Jen is trying to say, is that, you know, yeah, this is yucky, you know. It's not ideal. Brendan was a dick, and all that sort of stuff. But, you know, you'll emerge from this a stronger woman. And when the next situation comes along, you'll be able to handle it. We'd like to think that we've been a positive part of that transition. I thought you were my friend. [Jen sighs] I am your friend. No, Mel. Friends don't fuck each other in the arse. Some friends do. Like, I don't know if you're meaning arse-fucking in a bad way or a good way. Like, arse-fucking could be nice for someone, - when it's consensual. - Can we go? You two are disgusting. I don't know how you sleep at night. I really don't. [Jen] Great mattress! Anna! We are over an hour late for our next job, and we'll probably have to refund Brendan the money. This is the sort of thing that happens when you take charge, Mel! You're so mean. I'm not mean. I'm professional. - You're heartless. - You know what? You need to toughen up. That is a soft knock - Just soft. Just... - For fuck's sake. [buzzing] Tuck your shirt in. - Just tuck it In. - Just... [all] Surprise! Oh, sorry. We thought you were Trudy. Is everything okay? - No, unfortunately. - No. Trudy went for a hike this morning, and she hasn't returned. She's officially missing. [gasps] Is she? That's not... - Wow. - We have a... We didn't talk about this before... A note came through on the RT. - Not on my RT. - Maybe yours was off, and... I don't think so, I definitely heard... [mimics radio static] "Coming in, Constable Wood." What I was just gonna say is that we... There's a search party out looking for her, and we've got 100 of our best men out there. Past tense. They're back. They came back. No, they came back for lunch... And they had some interesting findings. - No, we haven't. - Yes, we have... found her. - Yes, we did find her. - No, we didn't. - They found a clue... - They found a corpse. - ...and we're... - She's dead!

And this is coming from someone who ruined my relationship, - who stole my boyfriend? - What? Joe cheated on both of us, Jen. I went out with him for three years. You rooted him for three months, and you never apologized. [Jordan whistles] My bad. Keep going. A decent human being would've apologized. Apologize for what? We didn't even know each other. Well, should I also apologise for being the one that ended up calling you to tell you Joe was cheating on you? For letting you sob on my shoulder every night? For being a good fucking friend? You know what? I have... loved... meeting Jordan, and I have loved... sex with Jordan, and meeting Anna, and hanging out with Anna. You know why? Because they're nice people, and they make me feel good. You know what kills me? You can't stand to see me happy. And I can't be friends with someone that doesn't want me to be happy.

Fair enough. But... When me and Jen started this business, we... We had the best intentions. And meeting you reminded me that... that we hurt people. And I feel bad about that, and I'm... I'm sorry, Anna. Okay. - Friends? - I don't think so. Oh, well, it was worth a shot. I got in touch with Brendan, by the way.

I don't have to help you with anything, white girl. All right. I understand that, but... - You still love him, right? - Of course I fucking love him. He's the love of my life, despite all the revenge fantasy dreams I've had of slashing his beautiful fucking face off. Why should she help you, bitch? Because of... the sisterhood? [laughs] The sisterhood? Did she actually say "the sisterhood" right now? Of what? The Travelling Pants? All right. I know I'm not part of your sisterhood. But Mel is like a sister to me and we've got our own little, tiny sisterhood. And our sisterhood needs your sisterhood's help. You feel me? [mimics Jen] "You feel me?" I feel you, girl. Okay, at least let me buy you a rum and Coke and we can have a chat about you getting your rightful man back. You girls feel like a drink? [all] Yes. [all chanting] There you go. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yum. That is some cold-hearted shit you guys do. Ice cold. I wouldn't say ice cold. I like it. I think this break has been really good for me and Jordan. It's just made me realize that I really do love him and maybe I need to show him more of my Queen B and less of my Sasha Fierce. You know? I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm very pleased you're happy to help. So I'll come up with a plan... Oh, no. No offence, Jennifer, but your guys' last plan sucked.
