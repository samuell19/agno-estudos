Do you even know how to use that thing, baby? - Of course, yeah. It's just like using my dick, babe. So that's a no, then? Well I never heard you complain before. Oh, because my girlfriends and I make fun of you behind your back. - What? - Oh nothing, baby. You know I love how you rock my world. - Pleasure, be good. Okay. - Do you even know where we're going? I mean it's getting really late and we still have to set up camp and god, I'm freezing my tits off out here. - Look, I will warm your tits, okay? And just give me a minute, all right? The guy said it was right up here somewhere, okay? You still wanna see it, don't you? - Well. - Look, you know how valuable this is? Do you have any idea? People go crazy for this shit. I mean if we find Alex Black's amulet, - Well that's just it, Paul. How do you even know what it looks like? Have you ever seen it? - No, I've never seen it but that doesn't mean that we should stop looking for it. People go crazy over this shit, all right? The smallest little piece of a serial killer's life and they just eat it up. We will be legends if we pull this off. Are you chickenshitting out on me? Do we need to go? Do we need to leave? - No, of course not. But can't we rest for a minute? My feet are killing me. Please? - Give me 10 minutes, okay? Give me 10 minutes. If we don't find anything in 10 minutes I'll give up, we'll look in the morning, okay? - Ugh, fine. - Thank you. - But don't think yo'ure gonna get to look at these tonight. - We'll look in the morning. We'll look in the morning, that's fine. - Now wasn't that worth putting off the search for? - Abso-fucking-lutely. I'm gonna take a nap, okay? Where are you going? - I have to take a piss. So do it here, so I can watch. - Fuck off, I'll be back in a minute. - Foul, no clothes! - What, bullshit. The fuck is over, clothing is back to being optional. - According to whose rules? - According to mine. She who owns the pussy makes the rules. - Oh, okay. She who owns the pussy makes the rules, okay. - I'll be back in a minute. - Yeah, yeah whatever. - Paul, is that you? Paul, quit fucking around. I'm serious. Hello? Babe, where's my weed? It's in the backpack. - Oh my god. Babe, babe, I think I found it. - Holy shit Paul, you did. You found Alex Black's amulet. - This is what gave him all his power. This is what made him imprevious to weapons and shit. - Impervious, dumbass. I heard it could also bring him back from the dead. But that requires a blood sacrifice. - Wow, looks like we're gonna be rich and famous, huh? One of us is. - What? No, no! - Aw. Poor, poor stupid Paul. Rise again, Alex Black! Rise again, I beg of you! - Now, the story is that Vietnamese torpedo ships launched a surprise attack on the United States in the Tonkin Gulf. And two years later, the United States reciprocated the attack. You're on the line with Outlaw Dave. You are the 13th caller.

Now the United States government would have you believe that the Vietnam conflict arose because-- Dammit. That's time, folks. Have a great weekend and don't do anything I wouldn't do. - That doesn't leave a whole lot. You smell like weed, dude. - What's that, Mr. Youngblood? - I said you too, sir. - Real smooth, dude. - Shut up. - Jamie, what the hell? If Mr. Miller would have seen you, your ass would have been busted. - So what? Miller can eat me. - Hey, I thought that's what I got paid to do. - Then I'm paying too much for the service. - Hey, I'd love to munch your tang like a fat kid eating cake. - You two seriously need to get a room. - Yeah, one with plastic on the walls to prevent stains from your bodily fluids. - Not a problem. She got me covered. Ooh, - You ass. I know someone who's got a date with Rosie Palm and her five sisters tonight. - As long as you give me a skin target, I'm game. - You two are seriously twisted. - Totally. So, Heather, I've got a surprise for you. - Is that what you flashed Mr. Miller's class for? - Well yeah. But trust me, it's totally worth it. Great, spazzoid's here. - Hi Heather. Hi sis. - Didn't mom tell you never to make eye contact with me while we're on school grounds. - Yes. - Hey Larry, how's it going? - Did you see there's gonna be an exhibit on the mating habits of a Loxosceles reclusa next week at the Museum of Natural Science? The Loxosceles reclusa. The Brown Recluse Spider! - Oh, right, right. Uh, really? Wow, that's amazing, Larry, but, - Dude, she's already got plans, spazzoid. Why don't you go hump some other chick's leg? - Maybe some other time, yeah? - Yeah, that's cool. Have a good weekend, guys. - You too, Larry. - Hey Larry. Hi, Caroline. - So, what's the big surprise, Jamie? - Oh, okay, okay. We are now the proud owners of four tickets to the Sacrilegious Desecration concert this fucking weekend! - No shit? - Really, holy shit, where is it? - It's up in Woodland Hills. - Woodland Hills? - Yeah, Woodland Hills. Doesn't your mom have a cabin up there? - Well yeah, but um. - Okay well, the concert's tomorrow night so if we leave in the morning, we can have the rest of the weekend to party our fucking asses off! - Yeah! - Yeah. - Mom will never go for it. I haven't been to that cabin since I was a little girl, not unsupervised, anyways. - Bullshit! - No, I'm serious. Since it's just the two of us, mom's gotten weird about me going off without her. I mean hell yeah, let's go get drunk and rock and roll until we puke! - That's the spirit. - Hell yeah, road trip. - I just, I don't know how I'm gonna clear it with my mom. - Just beg her. Please, pwetty please. Pwinsess wants to have some fun before her pussy dries up and she's in a nursing home. - Very funny, Jamie. I'll ask, but trust me Mom will never say yes. - Yeah she will. You know we've done everything else. - Oh jeez, what the hell are you reading now? - 10 surefire ways to keep him happy in bed. Is leave him the fuck alone one of them? - Who the fuck said I'm talking about you, asshat? - Jimmy twist. Hey guys. - Howdy, how's it hanging? - Oh Lou, you're always so much in my crotch. - Mhm, well, bored all day with this pain in the butt I figured your genitals might amuse me, Deputy Matthews. - It's Sheriff Matthews. I was elected last month, you may recall. - Wow, very nice, but I'm sorry I don't vote, Sheriff. - They don't let sex offenders vote. Hardy goddamn har. Look, listen to this comedian, huh? Well you married this so-called sex offender so what does that make you? Some lowlife slutbag? - As this slutbag is so painfully reminded every night you come stumbling into bed smelling like hamburger grease and raccoon farts. - Goddamit Bonnie, it was a possum. She doesn't even know the difference. - Easy guys, easy. - Dumbass. - Easy. - What's up, Sheriff? - This is a fascinating conversation, I'm sure that it's the highlight of my whole day but I didn't come in here to listen to you guys bicker about burgers and beer. - Is there something wrong, Sheriff? - Hey, hey, hey, you got that strange look on your face I haven't seen in about six years. - You remember there was a couple that came into town last week? Young couple? - Yeah, yeah, that was them, honeymooners, I remember. - Yeah. Paul and Dana Farmer from Mayland County. - That's right, they were talking about going camping up near Woodland Hills. - That's right. - Just leave it up to a man to think his wife wants to swat skeeters by a lake all night long. - Just like a woman to remind a husband what a pain in the ass she could be when he takes you on a nice vacation! - Anyway. - It was some skeeters I was swatting. Keep it up, I'll swat you. - Hey listen, they're missing and they've been gone for about a week. Have you seen them? Did they come in here at all? - Yeah they came in here, they came and asked a bunch of questions. - Really? - Yeah. - Like what? - Questions, questions they had no business asking. - Such as? They asked about you know who. - You know who, you mean Alex Black? - That's right. Asked about his powers, where the hell he was buried, the legend behind, you know, all that other nonsense. - Lou, what did you tell them? - I told them what I tell everyone else. Just a bunch of stories, that's about it. The girl seemed kind of bored and mentioned there was a rumor that Alex's necklace was spotted up near Adrienne's place. - Adrienne? - That's right, Adrianne. - Adrienne Palmer? - It's the only Adrienne I know, Sheriff. - Hmm. I didn't realize she was back in town. Yeah, she comes down here every once in a while to swipe alcohol from us. - You don't happen to know where she's hanging out these days, do you? - Yeah, where she at, up on the hill. Chuck's old place. - Beat up old house that Chuck Russell used to-- - I know that place all too well. - Right. - Well, you two. Thanks for the coffee. - My pleasure. - Bonnie. Lou, just say no. - You think they spoken since she got out of the nuthouse? - For his sake, I sure as hell hope so. - Kevin, you want this shit? Yeah. Oh! Shit's harsh, dude. - Yeah? Yeah. - You get it from the same guy? Yeah. Fuck, here, you want some? - Fuck yeah. - Here you go. Need another beer. - Here, take this, take that. Fucking. - Shitting motherfuckers! Adrienne, I need to talk to you, can you open the door? - All right, relax. Look at that. Nobody told me it was my birthday. - Hi. Hey, um, just one second. - Shut the door. There's bad people out there. That's very funny, but I'm on police business and if we could. - Okay. I will button up for business. I don't wanna offend your delicate sensibilities. - Thank you. - Come. - Looks like you weren't expecting anybody. - Because I fired the cleaning lady because that bitch, - Yeah, it's hard to find good help, you know, that's what they always say. - What? - Nothing, never mind. - Yeah, um. - Sorry. - That, that's okay. That's okay. Because tomorrow, I'm gonna spring clean. - Good. What do you want to drink? With me. Coffee, vodka. - Cup of coffee would be great if it's not too much trouble. - There's no trouble for you, Deputy Dwayne Matthews. Cream sugar or vodka? Cream and sugar would be good, thanks. - Cream and sugar would be good. All right. But, that's for you. - Thanks, no no, I'm good. - I like a little kick with mine. - I could see that. - So, I, uh, It's good? - It's great, it's great. It's a little strong, but, it's all right, I like it strong. - I am happy you're here, Deputy. - You know, it's actually Sheriff now. Whoah. - I won an election. - Wow, that's awesome. What, did the other Sheriff die? - No, no, he retired which is kind of why I won, it wasn't too hard. - Huh. Who knew? - Well I was at the Gas and Gulp. And Lou down there, - That guy's a dick. - Yeah, I know he's a dick. But he said that you might be able to help me with this. - Oh yeah? - Can you take a look? - What? I wouldn't kick them out of bed. You probably would 'cause you're funny now. But what'd they do, steal a duck from Sanderson's farm? - No, they didn't steal a duck. They're missing actually. And they rented a, they rented a campsite, they went for a hike and then nobody heard from them. It's been about a week. - So big time Sheriff has resorted to chasing down kids that ducked out on a 10 dollar bill. Don't worry, I've got money. I will pay it for them. - Have you seen them? I, have I what? - You haven't seen them, okay well, - I hope to see them. - Yeah. Adrienne, thanks for your help and for the coffee. If you hear anything, you promise to let me know, all right? - Yeah, you know what's really funny, Sheriff? What's that? - Kids go missing, they go missing in another town and maybe they're off canoeing. Maybe they're fucking. Maybe they just decided to go away. But kids go missing in Woodland Hills. Hey. - And everybody fucking knows! - Alex Black is dead, Adrienne. He's dead. All right, we buried him. - I've seen them. - Do you even remember any of it? Are you just too drunk to remember? - I remember everything. I remember everything that happened. And I remember every goddamn day that I was in that shithole of an institution. Oddly enough, I don't remember ever seeing you. - I think that you think you're the only person who was affected by that event. That's what I think. It's all about you. I mean look around. - Wasn't I? Hmm? - Adrienne I'm really sorry I didn't come to visit you. That's the only thing I needed to say today. Sorry? That's okay. I don't need apologies. - I'm gonna go now. - I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck 'cause you smell anyways, like a fucking pig. Like a fucking piglet. Fucking. I think you should come back when you wanna fuck, piggy. Ah fuck, fucking piece of shit. - Goddamn, I'm so fucking sick of Jamie, dude. - She always thinks it's about her. - Man I cannot wait to meet Dizzy Hayes in person. He's so fucking sexy! - You know he's hairy as fuck. - You think she was dropped? Like as a kid? - Oh, I don't know, I've never asked her. - I'm totally gonna blow him if I get the chance. - Really? I don't think Kevin would mind. - I'm gonna get so much fucking pussy at this concert. It's gonna be unbelievable. From her, right? - Who? - Who, Jamie. I mean that's what we do in the cabin. - Yeah, some of it. Is she okay with that? - Oh, yeah she's fine. - Really? - You know, as long as she doesn't find out, she's fine. - Oh fuck, I love this song! They better play it at the show. And "Tormented by my Lover", and "Stone Cold Steel Blue" and "Whipped by the Chains of Lust". And "Diving at the White". - They can play everything, Jamie. - I know. I'm just so excited! Woo, woo! Yes, oh this is gonna be so fucking wicked! That's all you, bro. - Oh fuck, this is supposed to burn? Shit yeah, that means it's working. - Is it supposed to burn your taint? Yeah. Give me the fucking joint. Here, here, take it out, take it out. - Dammit. - What, how do you not know how to fix this? - I'm not a fucking scientist. - Ugh! - 200 bucks. - So lame, ugh, why the fuck did you buy this thing? - Hey guys. A little problem here? What's up? - You guys need some help? - No. No, we're fine. - Really? - Yo, check it out. - We're going too. Sacrilegious Desecration. - Oh shit, yeah. - We were totally hitching but like Nobody's picking us up out here. You know, I know a thing or two about engines. If you want I can take a look. If I could run it, - Yeah, come on look at it. Hey, what's going on? - How's it going? - Okay, right on. You guys got a place to stay out there? - No, not yet. - Heather. - Oh okay.

No, no, we are taking him home right now. - Aren't we almost there? - I am not spending, I'm not going to this concert with my bratty little brother! - Come on Jamie, I don't even have to go to the concert, just let me stay at the cabin with you guys. - Oh my god. - So we might as well just let him go. It's not gonna kill us. Plus we need one sober person there this weekend so he can hold on to the tickets. - No, no fucking way. No way. - Well, why not? I mean look, he's gonna be the one responsible there so he can watch after the tickets and we'll be fine. I mean it's not like we can dump him. - Fine, I'll give him the fucking tickets, here. And you better not lose those. Don't lose those. I will fucking kill you myself. - You won't even know I'm here. I promise. I gotta poop.

Ew, no. - Wait, what? - Gross, come on. - What is this supposed to be your payback or whatever? No way, I'm not fucking doing it. - Hey, you know the consequences if you don't do the dare, babe. You gotta run naked through the rosebushes outside. - Yup. - All right, fine, fuck it. Whatever, I'll do it. - I'll take the dare, Jamie. Look, I'm still pulling thorns out of weird places. - Fine, fine! Fucking, I'm going to kiss her, you fucking happy? - No, no, bullshit! No, a full on fucking Frenchie style sloppy fucking tongue wrestling or it's the run. Get out. Rosebush, out. Rosebush! - No, fuck you, you never said how I had to kiss her. - No, no, no, see I think a vote by committee on this one is gonna rule in Kevin's favor, right fellas? - You are such an asshole. - Just shut up and kiss her. - Hey! - What, she's breaking the rules. You know how I feel about rulebreakers. You never said. - Just do it and get it over with. - Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss! Do it. Hell yeah! - The hell already. No. - I gotta put my mag down for this. - You guys are totally warped. I'm gonna go get another bottle. Anybody want anything? - Yeah, some fucking potato chips. Fuck, I got the fucking munchies like a fucking motherfucker. - I need another beer and pretzels, god, lots of pretzels. - I'll take another fifth. Take another fist. - Hey! - I have got to get the taste of that girl out of my mouth. She taste like the bottom of an ashtray. - I know. I guess it's really no different from kissing Kevin. You know, I don't like that chick. The way she looks at Kevin. It's like a dog eyeing on a chew toy. - Hit me? Or like a preying mantis after having sex. - You just had to go there, didn't you? - Did I hear you referring to a mantis religiosa? - Jesus, Larry, you're such a fucking dweeb. Will you fuck off? - Fucking off. - Thank you. You know he's had a crush on you ever since that time in Old Man Cunningham's field, right? - Um, fewer things have been more obvious and water being wet has been less obvious. - Where the fuck is the potato chips? - I'm coming. I swear if he doesn't watch his ass, he's gonna wind up dead tonight. - Attagirl. Way to go, stupid. - Ah, fuck me. Now that we're done with the garbage can we get ready and go to this fucking concert? - Come on, Bonnie. Don't you think we're getting a little too old for this rock and puke show? - Old, speak for yourself. Besides I deserve a night out after that shit you pulled last week. And you know what, stop with the stupid fucking accent already. - Bonnie, one fucking guy figures out that I'm from Brooklyn, the mob will be here in 15 minutes. So guess what, the goddamn accent stays, okay? - Shit, I can only be so lucky. Did you hear that? - Hear what? - Listen. Boo! - Goddammit, you almost made me shit my pants! - Stupid chickenshit. - What the fuck is wrong with you, woman? - You did smell surprised. - I've had it with this horseshit, get on your fucking knees. You wanna go to this show, get on your goddamn knees and suck my flesh flute! Ah, nothing, get on your knees! I've had it with this nonsense and this garbage and all your fucking sarcasm. Hey, you think you make bubbles come out of my nose with your flesh flute? - Yeah I'll make some bubbles come out of your nose like goddamn Elmer's glue, bubble all white and goopy all over your stupid face. Aah. Oh yeah, oh baby. - God, even with my pecker down your gullet you're useless, turn the fuck around. - You better make this fast. - I'll make it fast. I'll hold my nose and pretend it's your sister. Come in a second. - Concert blow and rail me. Ugh, thank god. What the fuck? - Ouch! Well? - Well what? - Well it's your turn to fucking dare somebody, genius. - Oh, sorry. Her, take her shirt off. - Heather, truth or dare. - Me? - This is gonna be fucking lame. - Truth. - All right, all right, hold on, let me think about this. What was that weirdness with you and that drunk bitch at the bar earlier? - You guys heard of the legend of Alex Black, right? How he terrorized this little town and a girl named Adrienne Palmer was the sole survivor? That was her. - Holy shit. - I thought Alex Black was just some local legend. - No. Every word is true. My family, about six years ago we came out here to just unwind, you know, and relax. My brother Ted, he was a bit of a rebel. I mean a really hard partier. He'd put us to shame. He and some friends were throwing a party at Old Camp Arapahoe. It was right across the lake. It started raining really, really hard and his girlfriend Delia, she was drunk off her ass and she decided to go for a swim in the middle of the damn storm. She got to the middle of the lake and Alex Black, he was there. He was waiting for her. He snagged her and he drowned her. My brother, my brother Ted he tried to save her. But um, Alex, he killed him too. That's why she said that you look just like him. She was talking about my brother. - How did she know him? - They were friends. She was over at my house a couple times but I was really little then so I didn't really get to know her. She was the one that found my brother's body. She's the only person to have seen Alex Black and have survived. She killed him right before she was committed to an asylum in Meadow Falls. I'm so sorry, baby. - That's awful, why didn't you tell us about this? It's a big deal. - How am I supposed to tell my best friends, oh by the way, six years ago, a serial killer stalked my brother and killed all of his friends. Who needs a fucking drink? - Uh me, definitely me. Thank you. I'm sorry to be such a downer, guys. - It's okay. Not to totally change the subject but we have about two hours before the show starts. Maybe we should get changed? - Yeah, yeah I got to take a shower anyway. You wanna join me, big boy? - Yeah go ahead, I'll join you in a second. - Whatever, dude. - Fuck. The fuck is up with Jamie? Really? - Dude. Ashley. Jamie's fucking jealous. - Whatever dude, fucking. Fucking chicks, man. - Fucking chicks. - This is not real. This is not real. - Ugh! - Shit, sorry. - Watch where you're fucking going, spazzoid. - Why don't you try and be a little bit nicer to me? Some day, I might not be around and you'll be pretty sorry you were ever mean to me. - Sorry? Oh, sorry I didn't realize nerds have feelings. Tell you what, the day I'm nice to you is the day I drop dead, okay? - Yeah, whatever. - Boo! - Oh, god, don't fucking do that again. I almost shit myself. - Well, you do no how to rev a girl's engines. I've been waiting all day to do that. - Yeah, me too. You ready to see the anaconda? - Anaconda? I was gonna say I could suck you stupid but I see someone beat me to it. - Ah, yeah. - Shit, hey Jamie. - Oh, sorry, I just should have been paying more attention. - No worries, it's cool, hey. You been crying? - Me, no. Be serious. - Come on, it's okay. Ashley's a super bitch. - Ah yeah she is. I love Kevin with all my heart. - Sweetheart, I know. And I'm sure right now they're out there somewhere fucking. So, do you want to get back at them? Oh yeah! Ah yeah! Feel the tits! Really? Just fucking do it, shitstorm! Awesome! Fuck! Ah, Kevin! Uh, Bill. Fuck you! You are fucking me, stupid! - Like read the fucking numbers! Oh yeah! - I hate my life. Yeah! - Jesus, Larry. You scared the shit out of me. - Yeah, sorry. I keep doing that. Are you comfy? - I'm just gonna go sleep on the couch. See if I can block out the sound. Big sis has loud orgasms. Let go of my fucking face! Don't tell me what to do! Do it! - Larry wasn't kidding. - Doesn't Kevin sound weird? - Sound the way you sound when I fuck him. - Like a mammoth. Isn't that Bill's shirt? You're not Big Kev. - Don't tell anybody. Yo man, now that we're all close and shit you, uh, we got any more food around here? - Can we smoke some weed first? - Yeah, we can do that. I hope you wore two socks. - Jamie, what the hell? Why are you wearing Bill's shirt? - Oh, looks like I won't be getting any sleep down here either. - What do you think? Fuck Kevin. Fuck him, fuck that stupid fucking trailer park slut. He pissed me off, you know. So of course I go fuck the first guy that'll have me. Just are you surprised? - Yo. - Jamie. - What, Heather? Fuck him. They are dead to me. - Oh fuck. Oh fuck, oh fuck. Woo. So on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the highest, that's about a 32.9, right? - Yeah right. My dog fucks better than you do. - What was that? - I said yeah right, best I ever had. - Another satisfied customer. Oh hey, just keep quiet about this, okay? I plan on proposing to Jamie tonight at the concert. - Yeah, sure, whatever dude. Don't worry, you're safe. Cross my heart and hope to die. - Oh fuck! What the fuck? I need those. - Where's my wallet? Shit, fuck! Where's my fucking wallet? Shit. She's gonna kill me! - Feeling any better? - Ask me that again when I'm about here. - Um, guys. - Not now, spazzoid. - It's kind of important. - I'll handle it. So what's the problem? - I lost the tickets. - You did what? - I lost the tick-- What the hell, sis? Whoah, what'd I miss? - Oh, not much. Spazzoid here just lost the fucking tickets. - It's not like I meant to. - Just cut him some slack. Are you sure you lost them? - Well they were in my wallet. Now my wallet's gone. I looked everywhere for it. - I'm gonna fucking castrate you for this. - Jamie, calm down. Let's retrace your steps. Where was the last place that you saw it? - Um. Back when we were at Lou's. Oh dammit. Those two ladies must have swiped it from me. - Two ladies? - Yeah there were these two kind of slutty tattooed girls at the gas station that they cornered Larry and, - Tommy. Okay, so these two ladies, they seduced you? - They seduced him all right. - So wait, my little brother gets his pussy diddled by a couple of random whores and now we have to miss out on the concert of the fucking century? - Whoah, chill out, sweetheart. It's not even that big a deal. Fuck, Ashley and I don't even have tickets. - Well how are you and Ashley even gonna get in? - I know the door guy. He's a huge fucking perv, titty freak, man. All you gotta do is show him a little bow-chicka-wow, bow-chicka wow. - Stop it. - Titties. - Oh my god, is that all, fuck. Probably would have done that anyway. All right, fuck it. Now let's get ready to party till we puke. - Sacrilegious Desecration, here we come! It's going to, let me have a, tch, tch, ow, why didn't you do that earlier? Enough! - Where you going with that? - Jesus, Matthews. You should know better than to sneak up on somebody with a gun. - Yeah right, noted. But where you going with that gun? - You know exactly where I'm going. - I think you need to put it down. - Or what? You gonna shoot me? - Maybe. Maybe. But I think you should put that gun down and come with me right now. - Why are you here? Did you see him? You fucking saw him, didn't you? - I saw Paul and Dana Farmer, or what's left of them. - Alex Black. - Jesus Christ, Adrienne, I know you can't get Alex Black out of your head but I did not think that you'd murder an innocent couple and blame it on a ghost. - Murder anybody? Matthews, it was Alex. Put your hands on your head. - Fuck you. You're making a mistake. - Hey, watch her. - Hot damn, this is gonna work. - I can take over from here. - Yeah, they're nice, but those don't look like tickets to me, next! - I just showed you my tits. - And I said they were nice. But if you want to come in, I gotta see hers. - Me? My what? - Your tits. - Just do it. - Okay. - See, I told you they'd come in handy for something someday. - Yeah well I can't wait to tell my future kids that I got into a rock concert by flashing my boobs. - Hey, chin up mate, you got in right? - Yeah well now I really need a fucking drink. - Let's go. - Thank you Woodland Hill!

God dammit! - Taco, you want one of these, come on. - No, I don't fucking want one of those, no, no. You know what, there's no fat chicks allowed. Bitches, leave. - Fuck you man, you know you want some of this. - God dude, are you fucking serious? Dude we need to be on fucking stage, dude. - No, no, I'm doing something. - Okay do one, hurry up.

Why the hell did they have to freak me out with all the talk about Alex Black? Who's there? - Nice horse head. - Caroline, what the hell? - Hey Larry. I heard you guys talking the other day at school. - And what, you followed us here? That's kind of stalkerish. - Well aren't you glad I found you? Well are you gonna invite me in? - For what?

I knew you were fucked up when I saw you this morning. But I thought, I thought I saw something of the girl I used to know inside. Please, please, give me the gun. Please hand me the gun. - Dwayne? I didn't kill anybody. - Adrienne Palmer, you're under arrest. - Alex Black is still alive. - Anything you say can and will be used in the court of law. - You're making a fucking mistake. - If you can't afford an attorney one will be appointed for you. - You're killing people. Sheriff Matthews, come in, Sheriff Matthews. - You are gonna kill people. - Sheriff Matthews. Sheriff, we got reports of a maniac at BAV Rock Club murdering teenagers with a pickaxe. - It's fucking him! It's Alex Black. - Sarah, do you have confirmation? Yes sir. Deputy Cunningham was in the area. - We have to go. - Shut up! - Matthews! - Sarah, what do you mean was? Communication was shut off after he screamed "He's killing me!" - Fuck, you stupid shithead. Get me out of this fucking thing. - Adrienne Palmer, you're no longer under arrest. - You stupid motherfucker. Give me the goddamn gun, let's kill this maggot again. This way! - I love you, man. - Oh shit! You cut off my fucking finger! - No, no, no! That was my favorite shirt! - All right, what's the plan? - Backup's on the way. - We can't wait. - Okay, you take the rear, I'll take the front. - That's different than the Matthews I used to know. - Heather! Fuck. - No! - Holy mother of god. Go! Go, go, get out now! Hey, maggot fucker! You remember me? - What the fuck? You guys are ruining everything. - Shut the fuck up, spazzoid. We are in for a world of shit if we don't get out of here. - Come on you guys, hurry up. It's getting creepy here. - Crap. How bad is it? - Oh, not too bad. - Okay. Not so good either. - Where's he at? I don't know. - Can you move? I'm not a doctor. What the hell are you talking about? - Alex Black! He's real and he's alive and he just killed everybody! - Holy shit, you guys aren't kidding. - No we're not, now put your fucking clothes on so we can get out of here! Hi, Caroline. - Fuck. What the fuck? Come on guys, we gotta hide. - Where can we hide? - This is just like second grade. - No, what? - No, Caroline, just stay. - Fuck off! Larry, go! - Come on you pussy, come on! - Get away from him! Spazzoid, run, spazzoid! - Jamie, Jamie! Larry, go get her! Jamie's still in there! Wait, Tommy! Look at Tommy, Tommy! - No, come on, come on! Come on! Let's get the fuck out of here. - Tommy, where the fuck are the keys? Goddammit, where are the keys?

I don't know fucking how but it's bringing him back to life. So we gotta get it, we gotta destroy it. You go to town, get all the fucking people you can, ones with guns, knives, crossbows, pitchforks, I don't give a fuck, fire, bring them back here. - What about you, what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna try and stay alive, kid. Hey scumbag. Jesus Christ, why don't you fucking die already? Come on, motherfucker. No, no! Fuck you! - Let's shoot this fucker! Hold your fire! - Smash it. Smash the amulet! - Sleep now, Adrienne. Rest in peace. - Come on, ma'am, let's go. - They're all dead. - Everything's gonna be all right now. - All of them, they're, they're all dead. - We're gonna get you all fixed up, okay? Come on.
