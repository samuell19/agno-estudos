IN THE FUTURE... due to radioactive pollution of the environment... humanity leaves the hostile surface and tries to survive in the underground corridors of a... NUCLEAR SHELTER Attention! we have reached the end of another leisure period. Occupants of sector thirty-one, go to your work area. All Monitors, take on your duties... and organize the next journey. Monitors must issue daily reports... ranking the most outstanding ones... by degree of achievement. This report must be confidential. Use the red line and register your identification in code. The Nuclear Cyber System... programs, guarantees and maintains your life. Watch out for your individual schedule... and obey the command. The new artificial protein recently discovered in our laboratories... has some advantages over the one currently used. its nutrition potential is absorbed by up to 80 percent. Therefore, the new food paste will have its volume reduced. The pleasant and penetrating taste... will soon be assimilated by everyone. Less intake volume, more energy. More information in the next announcement. Protect our children. They are the guarantee of continuity. A small change in General Behavior has been noticed. I ordered an increase in the dosage of tranquilizers. Don’t worry... it happens sometimes. It’s not serious... Maybe this is serious... Surface Control has lost contact with Operator Lat. Demons! It is not the first time! We need to find out what he's doing out of antenna's range. There must be a failure in the transmission system... Failure? We lost contact after he left ventilator’s area. Certainly he’s gone too far... Commander Avo is right... Lat is too old to operate at Surface. You took so long, pal! That’s not possible! Jud is watching you! The day is gorgeous up here! I’m heading for collect. Arrived in time, pal. She’s very angry! Recovery Phase One Docking in 40 seconds on deck 03... Pressure difference in the well: 019 Take a good look... This can be your last time. She’s talking about replace you. Ok, lets go... Deactivation... Position... Eyes... Attention! She mentioned again about replace me? She’s even called Inspector Mac! That's exactly what it's marking... Inspector Mac, I... They’ll be surprise with my next report... What is happening outside? Something serious? At the very least, it's the worst thing that can happen to us... The worst thing that can happen to us is keep you operating! Inspector Mac is looking this failure at your terminal... Allow me, Commander. The recuperation is priority. Remove the protection suit. - This is absurd! - Issue preliminary report. AN 307... Mission: 52/527 Clearing... ...of ventilators in North sector. Removal and storage of radioactive waste... Sectors K, V and U. Special Note: Deposit's area is about to saturate. Sector's V last three reservoirs are filled. Temperature of the area... ...reaching dangerous levels! A very extensive preliminary report... limit yourself to scheduled tasks! The System will have a solution in three seconds... for that waste storage problem of yours. This time won't be that easy! All known salt mines are already full. Close immediately this report and come at my office for tests! You are trying to perturb System's Unity with alarming news! It is not true! My report is a simple statement of what is happening. Unacceptable report! Lat's fascination to the Surface... ...is becoming dangerous! Allow me, Commander... I should note that Operator Lat... ...referred to a concrete and very serious problem. And that was not considered by the System. Attention! I repeat. The System will have the appropriate solution for the matter. We have all Surface available. Lat's the only real problem. Doctor, check quickly the security level of Lat's psychogram. The situation advises for a personal test. The security demands more urgent actions. Maybe we should arrest him when he leaves the cabin. Arrest Lat for warning us? For alarming us! And trying to break System's Unity... ...as is already occurring. Proceed, Doctor... You need to contain the man! Avo can deactivate him. I'll try. It is a difficult task... but I'll try. Docking in fifteen seconds. There is a dominant impulse! Some kind of determination to accomplish... something he considers very important... Or destruction of what already exists. It’s possible. However, based on the data presented we cannot consider him dangerous. Anyway, there is no way to keep it him working... Totally agreed. Jud, emergency situation... Make a note to maintain permanent vigil on sector V... And special instrumentation on my next assignment. You'll not have a next assignment. I just completed an information load... that will disable you from operating on the surface. Await for System Notification! Commander Avo... It's a serious emergency! The saturation of deposits can cause spontaneous combustion. - Nothing up there is important... Radioactivity and cosmic rays... have been burning that damn region for a few million years. Our world is down here! The explosion will destroy this shelter and the warehouses. Imagination... Fantasies... Insubordination! Commander, the shelter, this world of ours, depends of the Surface! The surface... Yes. We are attached to it somehow. I feel it. Everyone here feels it too! Put a end in our doubts! Reactivate the memory! We need to know how it all started. Shut up! You are insane, Lat. Did you forget about the Second Generation... ...and all the people who killed themselves after knowing what happened up there? The Horror... death... and disease. Our race has nothing to do with the demons that vegetated on the surface. - But commander, the men... - Shut up! Consider yourself disconnected. You're banned for a hundred periods. Doctor Emma, ​​immediately summon the surface team... ...to carry out a replacement. My mission is to keep everyone alive and healthy. The past doesn't exists. Imagination is a fatal disease. The operation is ended. Jud has been appointed to replace you. The schedule is not valid. Ro has not yet completed training. The System is a machine. Avo is a mere terminal. However, Dr. Ima could intercede. I don't trust this woman. Please trust her, Lat! Ima is with us. Hope you right. She knows so much! If we start to suspect ourselves, we're in trouble. We're in trouble anyway! When Jud goes to the Surface, he will immediately discover the Collectors. She knows this and has done nothing to stop the replacement! Nic, we can't take any chances. Ok, I'll be around her. We're in trouble. We lost access to the Surface. What's worse is that Jud blindly obeys the command's orders. She'll stick to the Program and blow up that warehouse. That's the only thing I think about. An explosion in that area would affect this shelter. Indeed. The warehouse B is just above North Area. The explosion could open rifts... and radioactivity penetrate this shelter. The situation is serious! So serious that it demands a direct contact with the Professor. - Personal? - Personal? Personal. The situation demands. But, Lat... this is risky! The security of the Alpha project depends on the Professor's anonymity. If someone captures you... Avo rips out his name along with your fingernails. You just said. The situation is serious. I think it’s time. We can't stand by while Jud goes to the Surface... and hands everything over to Avo. Are you thinking of trying to talk to the Project now? Let's wait what? This place blows to take action? No. We need a personal contact with the Professor... I'm sure he'll agree with me. So... will need to find Rak. He's the only who knows Professor. Rak is moving through the ventilation channels. He could be anyplace in this shelter. So, let's open it and search for him. Whoever finds him, proceed to the Central of Ventilation. Did you manage to assemble the Central Collector? It is already tested. Produces at full power. Rak, the situation is serious. We need to make personal contact with Professor. Personal is impossible. The Professor's identity will be revealed only when the project is activated. Then, it is time now. With the Central Collector producing electrical charge... we can shut down one of the old nuclear reactors... and begin the Surface rehabilitation process. That's it! Replacing energy sources is the first step. And now with the saturation on V Deposit everything gets more complicated. Did V Deposit show signs of saturation? It cannot hold even one cylinder more. I should remind you that V Deposit is just above Shelter's North Area. That's the facts. If there's an explosion we could have rifts... Rifts, Rak! The radioactive atmosphere could penetrate the Shelter and kill everyone! It is a incredible situation! And the worse is that Jud will replace Lat... and he will certainly follow the Programming to the letter. And it will saturate the deposit, no doubt! Wasn't Ro training to replace Lat in an emergency? There was no time for him to complete the training. And we weren't expecting a replacement now. The reality is that the Programming has already indicated Jud. Jud can't go up to the collectors... You are right! I'll take these new facts to the people in charge. I cannot decide such a delicate matter alone. Wait for confirmation in the ventilation ducts near the Leisure Area. Let’s go! The surface operating team pose a problem. They insist to speak with Lix in person. We can’t risk it, Rak. It is that serious? One of the nuclear waste dumps is saturated... Hope is not “V” Deposit. It is precisely this one. I don't know why so much caution After all... we’re not strangers. If they don’t take this care... professor’s identity may fall into Ava’s ears. But we who are up to our necks in it ...we’ll transmit today scheduled games results. I'm sure they will understand the situation and agree. You two, be careful! - The listening post approaches... - Get lost! Attend to your individual schedule and obey the command. Lat... Don’t turn. Rak sends word that everything is fine They agreed. Where’ll be the meeting? In geology laboratory. In geology laboratory? What about the listening system? Don’t worry about it. Rak is waiting there. - Is everything fine? - Yes, everything’s fine. - Where it will be? - In geology laboratory. In geology laboratory? I’m not understanding nothing. Let’s go. There we’ll understand. - You may take off your belts. - Here? Take them off! We don’t have listening here. Amazing! The Computer is inhibited. - How’s possible? - It’s simple. We use the expression Alpha Beta Gamma. What’s that? It is the ionizing rays that pollute the surface... For being strong related with the past... The Computer is inhibited. Simply and brilliant. Surely a professor’s idea. When we can see it? Right now! Lix... may I interrupt you... Our surface control team is here. Operator Lat is among them? I insist in this personal contact because... we are on the verge of a major disaster. I have already been made aware of your preliminary report. The situation is severe, indeed. It is so serious that Ava is reassessing Terva process... Terva process? We can’t accept it! - It’s madness! - And what’s that? It is the monstrous idea... of ​​getting rid of atomic waste... by sending it into outer space. If the vehicle fails, it returns in much worse condition. Disintegrated into atomic cloud, radioactive dust... This would significantly delay the surface cleaning process... Of course. I don't see how to get around the situation Nuclear power plants continue to produce radioactive waste. And now we don’t have where store it anymore. And what's worse is that Jud was appointed to replace Lat... And he’ll discover solar collectors. We must take control of the Shelter immediately! I don’t see any other alternative. - Let’s put the Project in action! - We must avoid disaster! We’ll start Phase One releasing the information about the past. Is there any condition to make the transmission? We convinced a chief director of leisure programming He’s trying to conquer people in that area. We’ll reproduce the images from the past. So we’ll reactivate the terminal? Yes. And we’ll register the end of the surface’s civilizations... thus proving their relationship with our problems today. And what about the paranoia of psychological imbalance of mass suicide that Avo talks about so much? A strategy of the System. To keep the terminal deactivated. Avo doesn’t want to loose her control over us. Suicides won’t happen. The exterior world is beautiful and shiny. Avo knows that there we would be all free. Before you make the key question activate recording. when finished remove the memorizer which is of the conventional type. I just can't understand why they choose me... It's simple. As a surface operator you will not suffer any punishment with the images you will record. You already know the sun bright... in fact, a double privilege: now you’ll be the first to know the past. Despite the System denying it... I never had any doubts: the surface was once inhabited. I fell it when I’m up there... Now let's clear the doubts I hope Rak manages to override the automatic censorship. I need time. I want to record everything. Don’t worry. Rak is expert on this... I just listened he say: “Rak is expert on this...” And who was this other person with Pit? Couldn't see. But they were heading... towards the Terminal of the Past. Jud, stop faking it... I heard the name Rak... What’s happening, Jud? You always claimed to me that goddamn Rak was disabled. Dead! I’m also not understanding... But I do! What is the explanation for the successive disappearances of Lat on the Surface? Why is Abe always evasive about this? I’m getting it. They’re conspiring! Dozens... Maybe hundreds of them! Although we are in the Sleep Period, we need to be very careful... Yes... it might appear a Inspector anytime... especially after you asked Avo to reactivate Terminal. - I’m going in... - Ok. I’ll cover you. AT SOME PERIOD, HUMAN LIFE EXISTED... ON PLANET SURFACE? HISTORY OF PERMANENCE OF HUMAN LIFE... ON PLANET SURFACE. EXTRACTED TRANSCRIPT OF CONTINUOUS PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM ORIGIN: DOCUMENTATION OF THE TIME AUTHORS: VARIOUS The human species appeared on the surface of the planet thousands of years ago... according to the ancient solar calendar they used... His historical memory dates back to the period lived in caves... where their first impressions were recorded. On planet’s surface... the human being enjoyed the full nature lavish in natural offerings. The land produced everything met all needs. Contact with Pit: 209250 Nic, call Pit... Pit, Lat’s here. I have everything recorded. But Abe wasn’t at the combined spot. There was an unforeseen. Rak was unable to disable the alarm system. But I managed to record everything! The Memorizer is here with me. You got it because Rak set Abe as bait so you could record Abe was arrested at terminal door. Arrested? And it will be deactivated, he is already in the House of Death. What is Lat doing on Surface Control? Good thing shouldn't be... Keep watching. I'll go there. Attention! Emergency contact with Commander Avo. Come to the Surface Control urgently! SURFACE RADIATION LEVELS Your stay is prohibited in this Control! What are you doing, Lat? They are here! Emergency operation. Do not interfere! Lat, come back here! Your infallible system made one more mistake... It was me who invaded the Terminal of the Past. Come back! Come back immediately, Operator Lat. It’s an order! You listened well... It was me who entered in the Terminal of the Past. Here is the Memorizer with the images I collected. Abe had nothing to do with it. I'm going to try to rescue him anyway. He is free to return. Jud, what are you waiting for? Hold the cabin! He triggered the automatic control. You claim that you keep the past disabled to prevent mass suicide. It's a comfortable position. We will never be able to preserve our species by hiding the truth. Lat. Once in the Surface, you’ll never have any chance. Come back. Return the Memorizer. Doctor Ima. Stop Lat! He’s with forbidden information. Abe has nothing to do with Terminal’s invasion. It was mine idea. I’ll rescue him! The rescue is justified. Lat! Give us back the Memorizer! Come back here! You can breathe. Breathe deeply. Nasal filters work well. This mask... where are we? On Earth’s Surface. - What’s that? - The sky. The ether. The infinity! I never imagined so much space! The eternal mystery never unraveled! Let’s go! This space... Now I understand why you have so much relevance in going down Up here is the true home of Man! So it’s true they lived up here? During thousands of years! - Until they enter the atomic age... - How could they do that? This space is vital. The true freedom sense. We lost this freedom due to the immediacy of our ancestors. We were condemned to the underground life And science, knowing this, did nothing? The problem were alerted! About two thousand scientists from all over the world... gathered to evaluate the new situation imposed by the nuclear alternative Having verified the problems caused by this new form of energy A warning statement was issued, condemning its use. At the same time, hundreds of reports and scientific papers... were released and immediately forgotten. Thousands of surveys, written in all languages have abundantly demonstrated Humanity was heading towards an irreversible situation of total ionization of the planet. So, it follows that they were not heard. Today the situation is more serious. We have nowhere else to put so much atomic waste I am hopeful that Professor's project can contain this situation Replace archaic nuclear power plants with alternative sources. Our first collector is already assembled. When we have enough charge... we can stop these poison factories once and for all. - And how is our situation down there? - You’re clean. I registered stating that I was the one who broke into the Terminal of the Past. - You’re mad! - And I showed Avo... the Memorizer to confirm your innocence. Did you accused yourself? I had no other choice. This complicates everything. How are we going to go down now? You go alone. I’ll stay. If you stay, it’s certain dead, you know. We die anyway... - If I go down, I'm doomed. - Why you, not me? C’mon give me a good reason... Your role in Surface Control is fundamental to the project. We can’t loose you. - Then, I’ll take the Memorizer. - No. It stays with me. You will be searched, it would fall into Avo's hands. Of course! She knows you're here, she won't let go... Be careful, she'll send Jud after you. I know... That’s why I need to leave this area right now. And where are you going? I'm going east where there's a lot of salt water... radiation there is less intense. - Out of operation area? - Yes, far east. I stand there waiting for a trusted Surface Operator to deliver the Memorizer. It can take a long time. It’s hard to find a trusty one. Ask Professor for support. He can help you. No doubt. We’ll make what we can. I’m leaving. Jud can show up. Farewell Abe. Don’t be discouraged! We must bring Mankind up here again. Lat, you always supported the Project... Now you’re giving all you can. It become your life. Farewell. I’ll be waiting on East. Attention, emergency! Operation 80527 reaching restricted operation area limits. Contact Mission 80/527: correct course to the west - He don’t listen us! - You’re reaching operation area limits! Correct course to the west! - He don’t listen to us at all! - What’s happening there? - We lost contact... Lat? Lat? Lat? Do you recognize me? It’s me, Ro... I worked with you at the Control, do you remember? Abe sent me... To do what? To take the Memorizer. Keep talking... Abe managed to transfer me to Surface Operation I outperformed Jud on the tests and here I am. And who is doing the psychological maintenance of the group? Ima. I mean... Doctor Ima. Kind of intimate treatment isn't it? Indeed, there is a intimate relation... it was planned to facilitate my access to the surface group. You know... Ima have the final word about these questions. But I also know that it brainwashes very effectively. You can be sure that my defense system is more efficient. The proof is that here I am! - But you can be working for her... - Stop it, Lat! I've been at this longer than you. I saw the professor postulate all the guidelines of Alpha Project. I was his assistance. And collaborator. Don’t you remember? Once again? - How’s happened? - Operator Ro disappeared. We just lost contact... What? Look at the screen, Monitor Avo... He deliberately crossed the operating area. Was warned minutes before we lost contact. Jud, search for his last position... Doc, verify his psychic conditions... - There is an error at the transmission. - I don’t believe it! Any failure would be denounced by the System. So what, doctor? It’s all normal. ...unaltered physical and psychological capacities. everything is normal. Surely is altered! It's out of the program. - Exceeded the contact radius. - He must be looking for Lat. The memorizer... I observe a certain precipitation in the conclusions. By the way, very inconvenient at this time. Soon he will make contact! I see you very confident in defending this subordinate. This shock wave doesn’t lead us anywhere. I suggest calm and prudence. This is the second operator that vanishes at the Surface. Has anything more serious ever happened at this Shelter? Commander... I recorded Operator Ro’s last moments He’s near the Great Liquid Mass. Take the sonar spectrum of that area. Abe, don't take your eyes off that screen! Check the psychic coincident analyses of Ro and... And Lat. Glad there is some agreement between us! And I tell you more... I have the impression that she is becoming aware. Relaxed her loyalty to the System. With some training I was already operating on the Surface I knew well that woman... She and Commander Avo make a nice pair of worms. But she’s changing, Lat... She reproached Jud who was your immediate replacement. Jud... that one I never forget. He was always wanting to listen to our conversations... A perfect dog from Avo. Be careful with him! It’s all under control... Abe made perfect arrangements. Avo... I’ll give you the Memorizer. - Do you know when it will be projected? - Immediately! According to him, even the replacement teams... have already given the green light. It’s all set! It’s good to know that human being will occupy this space again. It’s a long way. But it must start someday. Sure! If they stop producing radioactive isotopes, one day this atmosphere will be clean. - And people will came back up here... - That’s good to hear! In the past it was like this. It’s all registered in the Memorizer. You’ll see. There you go. Good job. But it will cost your life. I know. Knowing the Surface like I do... I felt already dead down there. Up here at least I enjoy full space. ...and something you don’t have down there: total freedom. I am delighted with all the beauty of the Surface. You deserted a long ago... It's amazing that it survived with all this poisonous atmosphere. Survived? Look here... The radioactivity is already starting to attack my cells. Tell Professor... that tests with my body may me useful in the research he makes. Anyway, I'm here waiting for any summons. Well Lat, I must be going... And now I must face commander Avo who promised me severe punishment. The memorizer has to get to the Professor and the people anyway! Everyone needs to know what’s happening! And try to annul the cybernetic and nuclear dominance that involves everyone! We’ll make it... Goodbye, Lat. - And what about the loneliness? - My friend and companion. Go ahead. Contact... we have re-established contact with the operator Ro. Glad we got it back. I’m re-establishing contact. I’m heading to Base. Unfortunately, I'll have to quote him in my report, Doctor. You vetoed Jud, our trusted man, to appoint this subordinate. It is advisable not to anticipate Commander... Operator Ro can bring us pleasant surprises. - Phase one recovery... - Now, right... Prepare for deactivation. Position... eyes. Did everything go well with you? All well. I only lost contact. Then don’t worry. Relax. Let’s continue. Removing protection gear. Turn off the terminals... I request local verification of radioactivity in my equipment. - I was exposed for a long period. - Positive. I’ll make the verification. Don’t come near. The cabin is not clear yet. Safe measure. He was exposed more than predicted. Attention, docking in 10 seconds. All under control, commander. All right. Cabin is clear! Pit! How was there? Ro is under pressure to hand over the Memorizer. And he’ll deliver. Run for the lab! Abe said we cannot lose time! Go to Avo’s Cabinet... There you can help Avo to be released. See you later at Leisure. - It will be today? - I believe so. My audio system is out of order. I can’t hear anything... What intrigues me is this staging of lack of contact... Operator Ro knows very well that I would authorize any mission that brings back that Memorizer. - Did he made the delivery? - No. He delivered anything. But Dan is following his footsteps. If anything goes wrong... Dr. Ima and Monitor Abe will settle accounts with me. - I don’t trust these three. - Specially Dr. Ima. She cut my chances of operating on the Surface. It was me who replaced you for Jud. Don’t you understand? Lat would never give the Memorizer to you. Hope he succeeded... If not, I'm going to the Surface... and I’ll ripe out that Memorizer from Lat! Lat is out of action... We need the heads of those ones here! Conspirators against this Command! You must be tired. You've had a long stay on the Surface. Found someone you know? Enough, Jud! Let’s talk straight... We don’t have time to waste. Nic, they're looking for you at Sector 28... Ro, we were waiting for you. Do you feel better now? I’m fine. I hope you haven't encountered any difficulties on the Surface. Let's get on with it, Mac. Remind him that Doc Ima promised us pleasant surprises. Hope they are pleasant! Remember that Doc Ima is in custody of this Command! Calm down, Operator Ro has a well-programmed conscience.. He knows his responsibilities. Good Job. Two extra periods of leisure for you... You did it! Still inside the cabin, Abe managed to exchange it for another one... Ro must be handing Avo a blank one and getting compliments. Now, we will finally be able to react to the first phase of the Project. - Your people is ready? - I just need to tell them... they are eager to get started... In Command, only Avo, Jud and Dan can show some resistance. Double surveillance on them. Ima and Nic are glued to Avo to contain his movements. Notify Group A that we are already in operation. Warn all monitors and ask them to proceed with caution. Rak, bring the Replacement Team here. - We don’t have much time! - What is it? Avo may find that the Memorizer's contents are blank! We can’t take that risk! We must set it today! - Today? - We must not waste time! Access to leisure programming is already guaranteed... You have to reach the Automatic Programmer that is in the next room. There, you replace the Emergency Box Memorizer. Very careful. Any slip the and the alarm system turns on. Pete must accompany you to provide cover. I know the people there. I know who could react. Finish the work. Good luck! We’ll need it. Let’s go Pete! Any information about wanted persons must be given personally to Inspector Mac... that will receive you at Command’s Cabinet... It’s there. Do not collaborate. Maintain yourself under the programming... it will always protect you. As Commander of this Shelter... I must warn you again not to let yourself be involved by harmful persons... that despise the Program. I am here to ensure the integrity of all who obey... Doctor Lix had warned me that you would come... - Fine. Let’s go then! - Speak louder... - Avo keeps a permanent censor here. - Which one is he? Just passed, in front of you. How are we going to do? The Memorizer is here... And we must replace it now! Let’s try to distract him. Dig... These are the Project people I told you about. We’ll activate Phase One. Transmit the Information about the Past? This will only happen if you get Dan out of the broadcast room. We can't risk him noticing the switch. Ask Lao to help. And take him out there! No problem. Leave it to me! Hope they make it. We don’t have much time. He left with Avo a blank Memorizer... If she finds out... She ordered to intensify this campaign... She already feel that things are changing and she’s desperate. As Commander of this Shelter... I must warn you again not to let yourself be involved by harmful persons... that despise the Program. I am here to ensure the integrity of all who obey our System. Denounce all those who conspire against this Command! Receive promotions like rewards for loyalty! This won't work at all! People are becoming aware and no longer hear this bullshit. Except for this one here... I’m sure Commander Avo would not agree with that... And we can’t take this responsibility... Let’s go there. I’ll handle it! Let’s get to work! Even considering it was an irregular action, it was a beautiful job! Only if we confirm that this Memorizer... - holds the History of the Past! - Do you doubt about it? No doubts about it! Dan had confirmed that Ro left the Control Room... straight to this Cabinet. And he was always followed by Nic. Then, if there was an exchange, it was inside the cabin. Yes, that’s it! During the inspection, they exchanged the Memorizer! I cannot live with this doubt. I'll check it out right now! Commander Avo... This is a check that not even you can do... Who do you think you are to speak with Commander like this? It's law! No one can reproduce images from the past! It is a crime subject to the death penalty! But this Memorizer is fake! And if it is not? - Withdraw immediately! - But she can’t... Withdraw! I risk my life but I don't live under betrayal. It is blank. I knew it! The real one must be with them. Mac, quick! Go after Ro! Issue an urgent order to capture Operator Ro! We are already in operation. Tell the others! Great news. I’ll tell them. Collaborate with inspectors and protect your identity. Do not welcome unwanted elements. Report them. Any information about wanted persons should... All Monitors are warned, except Abe... What happened to him? - He was deactivated. - Abe... dead? Then she already know about the exchange. Hope she doesn't find out before the broadcast... Nic is in Sector 28... if she knows something, she’ll come warn... How’s going... is everything ok here? Broadcast will begin... Ro... bad news. Abe has been deactivated. Deactivated... Under what charge? Involvement in the Memorizer’s Exchange. She has gone completely mad! No one was expecting this... You must get out of here quick, Avo issued an order for your capture. We must do something! ATTENTION EMERGENCY DETENTION ORDER OPERATOR RO 238.990 I’ll get going... You have to enter the first vent, quickly! Arrest this man! I told: arrest this man! - Get out! - Worms! I'll give you the only chance to stay alive. Tell me: where is the Memorizer? Avo... you've already lost your hold on us. You have only Mac, Jud and Dan. I will prove you otherwise. Set me free... are you mad? And now... will you say where is the Memorizer? The Memorizer is in the right place. You’re mad! I’ll be more mad if you don’t tell me where is that Memorizer. You’re mad... I can get you better doses. You've already seen that there's no point in resisting... Your life is in my hands. I wanna know where is that Memorizer. And you’ll tell me! You’ll tell me! HISTORY OF PERMANENCE OF HUMAN LIFE ON PLANET SURFACE. Now... more than never... it is in the right place. Damn you! Bypassing the Leisure System surveillance... the conspirators, after forcibly dominating all their monitors... made the criminal substitution. The penal deactivation of Monitor Abe... 273520 was absolutely necessary. It contained several first-degree factors in its process. However, his disappearance from our society... allows space for a new life. Let’s go! There is a special session at Leisure! The nuclear cyber program... programs, guarantees and maintains your life. The human species appeared on the planet’s surface thousands of years ago... according to the ancient solar calendar they used... His historical memory dates back to the period lived in caves... where their first impressions were recorded. On planet’s surface... the human being enjoyed the full nature lavish in natural offerings. The land produced everything met all needs. In ever-growing groups.. Humans have spread far and wide... building villages that later became large cities. whose lights attracted large crowds. Mega cities were home to several million inhabitants. The wild and blind pursuit of material progress... precipitated the formation of a consumer society... whose appetite devoured entire forests. They burned large amounts of fossil fuel daily... releasing tons of polluting particles into the atmosphere. The ecological balance was broken. The so-called progress that offered disposable advantages... demanded in exchange the very air they breathed. Later, the situation deteriorated irremediably... with the advent of the Atomic Age. The beginning of the Great Nuclear Catastrophe. The memory of that genocide... would soon be erased with the proposal to use these atoms for peace. They proposed a new source of cheap and abundant energy. The nuclear power plants. In a few years, thousands of powerful reactors were built to produce electricity. When in operation, these reactors produced a variety of radioactive waste that were liberated in the environment in many different ways. Once contaminated with radioactivity... human beings contract in short term several types of cancer and leukemia. And in the long run a disastrous artificial genetic mutation. To hide this reality, the powerful nuclear industry has carried out campaigns... ordered scientific reports to minimize the serious problems generated by the new and profitable technology. The production of radioactive material on an industrial scale... caused the total extinction of species. Ro is being moved to Death House. He’ll be deactivated, dead! Avo knows everything! She still maintains a few under control... We must act quickly! Speak with Lix! So it was with the peaceful use of nuclear energy... that human beings contaminated and destroyed... their own environment. - Rak! Gather everyone! We will take control of the Shelter immediately! I’ll try to stop Death House’s operator! Pit... go along with Nic. If you don’t make there in time... Try the rescue yourself using the elevator! Let's put an end to this old system, which only serves the interests of the Machine... Let’s recover our human condition. Let’s go! In all sites of the Planet... protest movements have arisen. The human mass was beginning to realize the great disaster. Force was constantly used to dissolve crowds... protesting in defense of nature. Progress did not admit retrogression. Nuclear energy was the last great step for science. it would be implemented at any cost. Come! Dr. Lix who leads the rebellion! The unity of the System and our very survival are threatened! Lat created a false illusion. A lie! Now we have to stop him from turning into an idol. Lat is dead! No one can survive the radiation! But it has not been deactivated. He’s officially alive. Go to the Surface and bring him! If you have any life left in it, use this. - Hemlock? - It’s fast. Instant effect. Lat's ruined body will destroy all illusions. Let's show that the Surface devours any form of life. Jud... your first Surface mission starts now! A token to your loyalty. What is Jud doing in that cabin? He's going to retrieve Lat's body or what's left of it. Retrieve Lat’s body? I'll demonstrate once and for all... the impossibility of life on the Surface. She’s mad! Let’s try directly with Jud. Jud, the revelation of the Past has changed people. We’re now living a new situation... All of you will pay for that! Jud, the orders are to retrieve Lat’s body... I’m still in charge! Avo has lost Shelter’s Command! Jud, did you heard it? The priority is rescue Operator Ro with life! Use the emergency equipment and rehabilitation ampule He’ll not do that! He’s gonna bring Lat’s mutilated body! Jud, this is the defining moment! Only you can save Ro! Avo’s orders won’t be obeyed anymore. Don’t be afraid of her! Now we have a reason to live! The Surface Reconquer! Jud, go bring Ro. He’s important to new times! Jud, all these people will be punished! Stay loyal to our System! Follow Commander’s orders! I’m aware of the new situation. I’ll act according to priority. Jud, don’t you dare disobey me! They’re coming. Don’t listen to them! Doc Lix, stop this madness! No one better than you to say that the Surface is the past. It's a lost time that will never happen again! The Surface... is the only possible future. Former Commander Avo. It’s absurd! Former Commander, me? Mac... arrest Doc Lix! Mac... arrest Lix! Demons! Traitors! Well everyone. We don’t have time to lose. Surface recovery is our goal. Let’s stop using it as a garbage can. So that one day we can enjoy it like our ancestors did. We already have a solar energy collector in operation. Let's deactivate the old nuclear reactors... and use natural energy sources. the sun, the wind... take advantage of the natural movement of the water. And let's finally stop the production of nuclear waste. So that one day, humanity can return to the Surface. If we work with determination, we will succeed. Where’s Jud? He left the cabin. We lost sight of him. Now anything can happen out there. We will succeed, even if it takes one million years. Because life is our goal. Life is our goal... Life...
