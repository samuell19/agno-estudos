DOWN ON THE CONTINENT, WORLD WAR I ENTERS ITS LAST PHASE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SPANISH FLU SPREADS FROM THE TRENCHES. THERE IS ALSO A NORWEGIANIZATION OF SAMI LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. NORWEGIAN LAW MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR SAMIS TO OWN THEIR OWN LAND. When I'm gone, you have to take care of one of the girls. While the other one will get a bigger task. Place her with the reverend's family. And make sure that the two don't meet again until spring. E. T. G. E. R. I. K. What is it? There's a man by the chimney. -Oscar? -Yes. It's good to see you. -I didn't think you'd… -Come home before the war ended? Father has been asked to establish a parish up here. -A parish? Is that so? -He has accepted. Good. You've grown. A lot happens in five years, don't you agree? Yes. -What are you doing? -Nothing. Come and say hello. Suzanne told me that your mother is dead. What about your father? Where is he? He doesn't exist. Sure he does. He's sitting right here. Wait. I have something for you. Thank you. How far away is Madagascar? There are many, many oceans between here and there. And they've been there to help people believe in God? Yes. Or to believe in their god. I liked the bird. -Did you like it? -Yes, I liked it. What are we going to name it? -Chirpy, maybe? -Chirpy? May I sleep in your bed? -If you promise not to snore! -I won't. Come here. I'll give you some morphine. It helps with the cough. Good. There is something going around these days. The British have broken through the Hindenburg Line. The war might be over before Christmas. -Says who? -People I've talked to. -What about your own voice? -What about it? -How's my wife? -I gave her morphine for the cough. -The best cure is to put her outside. -Outside? Sunlight and fresh air would be the best thing for her lungs. I'll come back and check on her in a couple of days. -More tea? -Thank you, Lise. My name's still "Louise". Oh yes. I'm sorry, Louise. -How are the drawings coming along? -I'm halfway done. It will have to do. -Didn't you see the sign? -What sign? Get in line with the others. You've got until Monday to get the money. -By Monday. -Wasn't that the reverend? Smith. Reverend Smith? My apologies. -I was a little preoccupied. -I understand. Welcome home. -Alive and in good health. -Thank you. It's good to see. The journey was better than we feared. Right, Oscar? -Is this your son? -Yes. -Oscar Smith. -Timann Flage, the ship's captain. This is my first mate, Gustav von Kantzow. -Can we take a look at the site? -Yes, of course. Reverend? It's this way. Time is adequate for those who use it. -Are you comfortable? -Yes. Thank you, Louise. -How are you feeling? -Better. Especially now that my hair is going to be as nice as Queen Maud's. -It won't be quite the same. -No? No. She's got a bit more hair. We appreciate the suggestion, but we've already hired an architect. We'll build it here. I'm afraid it's not possible. -Why not? -The area belongs to the Samis. Didn't you buy the land to do ore mining? -Yes. -Then what's the problem? We agreed to keep this area off the deed. Why? They talked about something they can't control. Control? Something spiritual. -Like ghosts or something? -Their words, not mine. Let my parish deal with matters of Heaven and Earth, and we'll leave the mining to you. We still have to discuss the Sami situation. Oscar will deliver the drawings next week. The church will be placed here. Jesus commands us to build on rock. Come rain or storms, he promised that it will remain. My children… Like the soldiers who fight bravely in the trenches on the continent, we… …we will also have to fight. Up here, we shall stand together on our battlefield. And God shall show us the enemy. The sins we carry inside, so that we have… Go home. Go home, I said! This place belongs to our Lord now. Thank you again for letting us use your living room. You have to meet my wife, Mathilde Flage. If only you knew how long I've been looking forward to this. I believe that all people need a leader. Someone who can unify and show them the way. -My experience confirms that. -I was told you worked in Africa. A missionary by trade and a missionary in spirit. But first and foremost, a family man. And these are your three angels, I suppose. Oscar and Agathe are my own flesh and blood. I can tell. -The youngest one is adopted. -Where do you come from, my dear? The forest. -The forest? -Where the Samis live. -How very noble of you. -You should thank my wife. -She's behind all of this. -How is she? You're satisfied, I hope? -As long as the developer is. -We'll see. This life has been a joy to me And 'mid earth's sorrows and its woe 'Tis joy my Jesus here to know O hallelujah, yes, 'tis joy! For it is Christ that I enjoy! On land or sea, what matters where? Where Jesus is, my joy is there "Every time I close my eyes, it is your face that I see. Every time I draw my breath my love for you grows in me." That sounds tiring. -Who gave you this? -I don't know. -Come on. -I haven't seen him. That's why you have me. Yes, so I can tickle you! My Lord, who preside over life and death. We ask You to have mercy on Suzanne. She who has cared for so many. Forgive her for her trespasses and for neglecting Your songs of praise. For Yours is the power and glory, forever and ever. Amen. Father! Father! I can't find her. From now on, you won't go anywhere without Agathe. She needs your eyes. Is that understood? Go and sit down. The upbringing has gone downhill in this house. No more profane duties. No more sinful games with the supernatural. Agathe. You have to follow the Lord's words in faith and obedience. We have to be unified as a family. Go ahead. Eat. Mrs. Flage is here to see you. Reverend Smith, I'm sorry for interrupting your meal, but I have to speak to you. Let's go up to my office. It was Mother. Don't you think? You heard what Father said. But what if she had something important to say? Just let me know if I can help with anything. The children or… Wasn't I supposed to help you? I really shouldn't be here. Everything you tell me, is in strict confidence. Please sit down. My husband and I have been married for almost 30 years. We never had any children, and… He blames you for that? He… …doesn't desire me like he used to, if you know what I mean. I know that he constantly… What can I say? He… …has a liking for Sami women. Are you considering leaving him? -He has never treated me badly. -So, what's the problem? I have my own needs. Needs that go unfulfilled and evolve into fantasies. What are these fantasies? It's easier for me to help you if you can… …be a bit more specific. I… Close your eyes. I'm walking… …on a trail… …in the woods… …by myself. It's getting dark. Behind me… …several dark men are approaching. I get scared, so I start to run, but… …I trip, and… …they catch up with me and hold me down. They push into me from behind, one after the other. I lie with my face pushed down into the ground. I don't fight back because I enjoy it. How long have you had these fantasies for? Ever since I moved here. I know that it's wrong, and that it's sinful. That is why I've come to you for guidance, Reverend Smith. I'm not well, am I? Thank you for your help, Reverend. -Don't mention it. -It means a lot. And… …let me know if there's anything I can do for you or your children in these difficult times. -Thank you, Mrs. Flage. -Please, call me Mathilde. Mathilde. Good night. What are you doing? I hear the screams. -What screams? -The children. They don't want to. They don't want to. And we force them into the water. I've got sleep medicine in my suitcase. Knock if you need anything. We did it to serve the Lord. The Devil's power has no place on Earth. He can't see us. -Who? -The ruthless. He can't see us. Come. Come on! There. Good. "Do not participate in the actions of the dark. They carry… …no fruit. Expose them instead. What people do… …in the shadows, is a disgrace." -Reverend? -Not now. -Keep going. -"Wake up, you who are asleep. Rise from the dead." You have to come to the building site, Reverend. -Can't I drink my morning tea first? -I'm afraid it's urgent. You can probably drink your tea first. What did Mother say to you? It wasn't her. It was someone else. Who? I don't know. I heard children's voices. They spoke a different language. It's children, Reverend. Several of them. What crazy person is responsible for this? Judging by the jewelry, it looks like an old Sami burial ground. You know what to do. Put them in crates and remove them. All of it? No, just those bones. Yes, of course. All of it. Have you told the mining director about this? Well, don't. Stay here and make sure that they don't do anything stupid. We'll put the crates in the basement and bury them in the spring. Can you take this shovel and dig out that skeleton? -Do you mean that I… -Everybody has to pitch in. There. All of these countries make up what we call the Nordic region. This yellow one is Sweden. That was before the war… -Are you okay? -I'm fine. -Do you need help? -No. -I'll go inside, wait here. -Yes. God-fearing men. Children of the Lord. We have a sinner in our midst. And as we all know, the Lord passes judgement, and the Lord punishes. But at the same time, He is merciful. The Lord wants to show us mercy. How could it be that simple, you might say. Why don't I have to answer for what I've done? We can all thank the Lord. Because the Lord took the punishment on your behalf. He died on the cross through Jesus Christ. Instead of you. But as Paul says: "The good that I desire to do… …I do not do. But the evil that I do not want to do… …I do." Therefore, I say to you: Your conscience has to be bound by the words of the Lord. If you don't confess your sins… …you shall be punished. You will be punished. You have to live in faith and piety or go straight to Hell. My child, confess your sins and let the Lord's salvation cleanse you and free you of your sins. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah! -Hallelujah! Hallelujah! No thank you. You don't drink? To be honest, I don't think that the guy upstairs cares. -God? -Your father. It's my own choice. Will your sister say yes if I ask her to dance? No. -Why not? -Because she doesn't dance. At least not with people like you. It won't hurt to ask. Thank you. -Do you want to dance? -I don't dance. Please. Just one dance. Come in. For all we know, he doesn't even believe in God. -What does he believe in then? -Himself. That man believes mainly in himself. Not unlike someone else I know. "For himself he will be. He will cherish his own in both big and small." -Nansen? -Nansen? It's Ibsen. Look at that filth. Are your private parts the same? -Do you want to see? -Sure. Do something about it before it becomes a problem. What are you going to do about the problem down there? I have no idea. The problem is that he steals workers from the mines. -Do you want me to scare him a little? -How? -Kidnap his son? -Take away his drawing materials? Give him syphilis? You can scratch each other. Thank you all for coming to the celebration of my gifted son who has drawn a beautiful church. Not to mention that the big war in Europe is over. -Cheers! -Cheers! Not good for the mining operation, but what can you do? Start a new war. It's almost midnight. There's only one thing to do. As long as you keep me out of it, there's still time to dance. -Cheers! -Cheers! -…cleanse us of all injustices. -God is loyal and just. My predecessor and chief was a master. God always forgives. Sorry for dragging you out into the darkness. -It probably seems very strange. -It's… It doesn't matter to me. -Whether it's light or dark. -Right. There are some things I've wanted to say. -Ever since I saw you, Miss Smith. -You don't have to be this formal. I'm sorry. That's very nice of you, Miss Smith. It's nice of you. Agathe, I… What are you doing? Father! Father! The night is over. Go home. Go home, I said! Go to bed. We'll talk tomorrow. Help her. Come. Just leave. -No! -She is one of us. I did warn you. We have to be realistic. We've got a burnt down church. We'll have to postpone the construction until next year. Perhaps even longer. Now that the war is over. What do you think? What are those heathens doing here? This is an old burial ground. We respect the dead, don't we? We've got two choices: I tell the miners who's responsible. Or… you seek God's salvation and forgiveness. -What do I do now, Reverend? -Kneel. Lord… …we have a sinner here who wants your salvation and forgiveness. -Say that you want the Lord's salvation. -I want the Lord's salvation. For I have sinned. For I have sinned. -For I have sinned! -For I have sinned. -Cleanse me with Your blood. -Cleanse me with Your blood. Bow your head and receive God's salvation. I was led by the Devil. I was led by the Devil. I have set Your holy house on fire. I have set Your holy house on fire. I have set Your holy house on fire! -I have set Your holy house on fire! -I have set… -Louder! -And set Your holy house on fire! -Louder! -And set Your holy house on fire! God forgives you. You're the only friend I have. Have you heard anything from Anton lately? No. Father doesn't like him. Do you like him? I don't know. He seems nice. And what if I say that he's the ugliest person I've ever seen? I don't care. As long as he's nice. Agathe! Agathe. -I'm not allowed to see you. -I can make you happy. I promise you. We don't even know each other. We've met two or three times. We have to talk to each other more often. Daily. -Should I speak to Reverend Smith? -No! -No, you shouldn't. -I won't. -Sorry if I got carried away. -No, it's fine. I like you. Just so you know. We have to go. Come. It was good that you said that last part. That I like him? Yes. I should… I should just be sad. Don't you think Mother would've liked him? Yes. Did Mother know that I've got Sami blood? Yes. But she didn't care. Is that why Father doesn't like me? Listen, My. The most important thing is that you like yourself. Where's the blouse? My! My, where are you?! Hello? Hello? You can't trust anyone these days. They know that we eat supper at eight o'clock. They have to go to bed on an empty stomach. Why aren't you eating? Answer me when I talk to you! How's the food? What's happened to the Sami girl? Is she suddenly mute? I don't think so. A little bit more. More. You've had enough, Reverend. What did you say? You heard me. No! No! What happened? She just has to rest now. -Good night, Reverend. -Thank you, Doctor. I gave you a simple task. This is your fault. I fear she'll never recover. It's… …going to be all right. What if you wake up tonight? Drenched in sweat and fever cramps? Your guts are about to tear you apart from the inside out. If you're lucky, a doctor might see you. But he can't do much. Your last hour has come. How can you sleep at night if you don't know whether you'll wake up in your own bed or in Hell? You… who have not been converted. You… …who have not been converted. Convert now before it's too late. Before the torments of Hell grip your flesh and never let go. The Lord became human for your sake. He suffered for you and died for you through Jesus Christ. But He cannot choose for you. You have to do that yourself. And when you choose God… At the very moment that you choose God, he spreads the remission of sins over you and all of your past. He gives you peace. Peace in your conscience. Peace in life. Peace in death. -It's been a long time. -Thank you for the service. -Reverend! -You can keep it. It was an interesting performance. -Performance? -What do you call it? Revelation. The collection goes towards the rebuilding of the church. We hope to recommence after Christmas. Where are your workers? It was only half full. We are in mourning. We lost Gustav the other day. The best go first. That explains why you're still alive, Reverend. Reverend Smith… Save me! Don't let me fumble in the darkness. I need your guidance and firm hand. I beg you! Free me from the evil urges that are inside me and have lured me into sin. Please, don't let me burn in Hell! Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Have we met each other before? Don't you speak Sami? I have to go. Agathe! Agathe! Agathe! Agathe! Let me talk to her. I beg you. Reverend Smith! Take it easy! High fever and severe cough. Aches in the ears, eyes and back. Bleeding. Problems breathing. We had one death yesterday. It looks like there will be two more today. I've told the company to shut down the mining operation, but they are determined keep the production going. -I can't do much. -I know about these challenges. I'll get to the point. A patient has an infection in his lungs. The time has come for the last rites. I'll leave you to it. Come, My. 35 kroner and 46 øre. Father? We've collected 35 kroner and 46 øre. I… I want to move to Kristiania. To enroll in the School of Arts and Crafts. But you're an architect. Yes. But it's not what I want to do. When did you get this notion? It's… It's a dream I've had for a long time. A dream? You're staying here. I have to talk to you. So now you want to talk? I'll give you a discount on the lease. Unlike you, I don't care about money. We both know that is not true. What happened to the child? There were two. One of them was placed with someone. That's all I know. She needs our help. What can we do? I don't know. -Wake the others. -How? Let me think. I just want to go back to sleep. You'll stay here until Jesus Christ has driven Satan from you! Lord. My savior. You who I have served and loved with all my heart. My redeemer. Where are You? Why don't I see You anymore? Why don't I hear You? I have neglected my role as educator. I have neglected my duty to educate my children. I have lost myself in grieving Suzanne. I have killed another man. I have slept with another man's wife. I deserve to be punished! Cleanse us. Cleanse us! -Have you seen Oscar? -No. -Where are you going? -I have to go home. Home? Why? My child is sick. I have to go to Trondheim. Your child? Nikolai. Why haven't you told me? You never asked. There's food in the kitchen. The Devil's power has no place on this Earth Merry Christmas. Breathe. We've had a small accident. -What can I do for you? -I think you've done enough. -I'm not sure how to interpret that. -Interpret it as you will. The plague has forced us to shut down the operation. I've only come here to… …get my daughter. She's in the basement. You are aware that my wife is dead? It's a huge loss. Really. We got to know each other well. Then you probably know that she was pregnant? It's difficult to say who the father is. All I know, is that I… …haven't been inside of her in five or six years. Something like that. I have to admit that I've asked myself lately: Why did everything go wrong after you came back? Is it some kind of twisted prophecy that you've cast upon us? A punishment from God that has ruined my life work? I have to say that just thinking about it makes me a little bit religious. But then I come to my senses. He's no better or worse than the rest of us. You're just a small, small man. With very lofty thoughts about… Certain things you have to believe in in order to see them. Do you remember what you said when we stood at the altar and took the vow of fidelity? You promised to take care of our children forever. To protect them against evil. To love and honor them. You have betrayed me. You have betrayed our children. You have betrayed our God. Father? Father! Let me go! Let me go! Agathe? Agathe, it's me! Agathe? Place her with the Reverend's family. And make sure that the two don't meet again until spring. POSSESSION
