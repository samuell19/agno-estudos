[music playing] Hey, Vern, boy, I'm sure glad you switched from that Uncola. Sprite's everything that stuff is-- clear, clean, caffeine-free. But Sprite tastes better because only Sprite has lymon. Know what I mean? Ah. Pop me another one of them bad boys. How about it? Vern. Vernon, oh-- uh, uh, my ha-- my-- my-- my hands, Vern. Vernon, my-- uh-- Whew. Hot ain't it, Vern? Look what your old buddy Ernest has brought you, Vern, an icy cold Sprite instead of that 7Up you used to drink, because only Sprite's got the great taste of lymon. Sprite, Vern-- just the thing when you're working up a sweat over one of these old off-brand air conditioners. Know what I mean? Well there's your problem right there, Vern. You see that little wire right there? Looks like it's got a little sh-- [burbling] --ort in it. My daddy used to work on them. Hi ya, Vern. Whew, it sure is hot up here, Vern. I bet you'd like a cold smooth Mello Yello right now, wouldn't you? Yeah, I just bet you would. You know, Vern, there's nothing like a good old cold Mello Yello when you're all hot and sweaty. I think it sure beats that Mountain Dew. [slurps] Ah. You know what that sound means in Russia, Vern? Empty. [chuckles] Aaa! Vern, I-- aaa! Aaa! [clatter] Hey, Vern, look what my brother-in-law just got down at Tysons Toyota, Vern-- a brand new Toyota Supra, a dream machine. Sexy too, ain't it? Hey listen, Vern. Why don't you go in the house and get you on some long pants and some of that musk oil? And me and you will go out and find us some action. What do you say? Good morning, Vern. Your old buddy Ernest is fixing you some of his world famous recipe for buttermilk pancakes, made with delicious, nutritious Challenge buttermilk. See, it's the one with the little elk on the label. Only it ain't elk milk, it's cow's milk. I mean, who'd want to milk a elk? But anyway, all us great cooks use Challenge buttermilk. OK now, get ready, Vern. You ready? Here it comes. You ready? Pancakes on parade. You better believe it. Boy, Vern, this sure is a dull game. I know it takes strategy and all. And speaking of strategy, your old buddy Ernest, noted entremanure, has moved his entire financial kingdom to the Vernon Savings and Loan. Know what I mean? Yes, the vast financial empire of Ernest P. Worrell is now earning a whole big bunch of that filthy luker on a daily basis. My move? Crown me. Hoo wee! Cold, ain't it, Vern? Have you had your coffee yet? I'll tell you that Convenient has got some coffee. I've got to have my Convenient coffee every morning. It's so hot, and black, and rich, and good. That freshly brewed Convenient coffee every morning gets me moving. I'm movin', movin', movin', movin', movin' in my Convenient cup. I'm movin', movin', movin', movin', movin', movin', movin', movin', movin'. I think I'll have a doughnut. You know, Vern, Cream o'Weber Hi-Land sour cream is so good on everything from potatoes to tacos that it has inspired me to write this poem. I infectionately call it "Sour Cream" by Ernest P. Worrell. Actually, it's by Cream o'Weber Hi-Land. I just wrote the words. Roses are red. Violets are blue. Sour cream is white and comes in a tub. Better watch out, Vern. Old Ernest is going to fire this bullet. Now go on back. Go on back long. That's it. Now button hook. Now cut on over. There you go. Better watch me now, I'm up on my sports. I watch Ron Franklin, Channel 2 Sports. That Ron's a big-leaguer, buddy. Ron Franklin is a pro. Hey, Vern, why don't you go get that big bad brother-in-law of yours and we'll play a little touch. You want to? Huh? Huh? Is this your brother-in-law, Vern? Tell you what, how about I center for both teams? Know what I mean? Take out the slack. OK, Vern, here's the deal. If I can pull this off-- if me, your old buddy Ernest can pull this off-- you will buy me a year's supply of Quality Check milk and ice cream. Is that it? Easy. A year's supply of them primo Quality Check products if I can pull this off? OK. Edna, gun it. (SHOUTING) Edna, turn left at the light. Hey, Vern, I guess you've been reading about the Cola Wars. Yeah, Vern, the big two have been going at it toe to toe. But you know, Vern, I've been wondering how Purity orange juice can get in on this. But Purity orange juice don't have any caffeine, or added sugar, or carbonation, or artificial coloring. It's just an all natural, refreshing drink full of vitamins. I guess they just can't compete. But, boy, I like a good scrap. [growls and snarls] Hey, Vern, I stayed up all night to study for my official Ernest P. Worrell Mello Yello-Mountain Dew taste test. I bet you don't think I can tell the difference, do you? Hm? Watch. Mm, That tastes great. That tastes great too. But I think-- well no, I like-- I can't tell the difference, Vern. I guess I flunked the taste test. I bet I'm going to have to clean the blackboards again. You owe me $14, Vern. You know, Vern, I'm worried about your financial stability. That's why you ought to be watching News Scope on Channel 2 at 4:30 every day for them money tips. Know what I mean? That Bill Balleza has got consumer reports, Vernon. I watch it everyday. That's why I have a working knowledge of cash flow, supply and demand, and the free enterprise system, Vernon. And that's why you, Vern, should trade me Park Place for the Water Works. Know what I mean? [clucks] You know, Vern, there's nothing like a picnic in the great out of doors, being at one with nature. Know what I mean? And when you have a picnic, Vern, you gotta bring plenty of my personal favorite, Sprite, the one with the great taste of lymon-- mm mm-- the one that undid the Uncola in that taste test. Yeah, Vern, nothing makes a picnic like good food, Sprite, and fire ants. Fire Ants? Oh, oh, oh, Vern, oh, oh, oh, oh. Which one do I really want, Mello Yello or Mountain Dew? Hm. Eenie meenie miney mo. Mm. One potato, two potato, three potato, four-- oh. Paper, rock, scissors-- Why use all that mathematical analytical analysis? I'll just pick the one I like the best. Ah. Make the Mello Yello move. Know what I mean? Vern, I know this to be true. Trust me on this one, Vernon. When you go to deal on a new car somewhere else, you might only save this much, Vern. But your old buddy Ernest would be willing to traverse countless thousands of miles or just around the block in order to save this much on a new Tysons Toyota. You might call this phenomenon pizza logic. I do. [alien sounds] (ALIEN VOICE) Attention, people of Earth and Vernon, important announcement from Braum's. The biggest scoop of ice cream ever placed on a cone comes from Braum's. It is the most delicious treat known to humanoids. Proceed at warp speed to Braum's. Know what I mean? Yum. Yum. Yum. Hey, Vern, who was that weirdo? Snappy dresser though, huh? [alien sounds] $5.95. $16.50. Oh, hi, Vern. I was just practicing for the "Price is Right" with Tom Kennedy weeknights on WDBJ 7, Your Hometown Station. Ming vase? A steal at two grand. World War II hand grenade-- $15. Probably a dud-- $3.50. I can almost hear Johnny Olson right now, Vern. Ernest P. Worrell, come on down. [blast] Hey, Vern, you digging a hole? Why? Did you call the gas company first? Why not? Vern, if you don't call before you dig, you could hit a gas line and really mess up a perfect afternoon. Know what I mean? No heat, no hot water, you can't cook, and you're sure not going to make any new friends down at the gas company. Know what I mean? Uh, Vern, since you're down there, get me some night crawlers. Oh, hey, Vern. Me and Shorty just took a test drive in your new Ford pickup. Handles like a dream. Golly bob howdy, Vern, I can't understand how them boys down at big Duval Ford can sell them so dad-blame low. I guess that's why they're Jacksonville's number one volume dealer. Well come on, Shorty, let's-- oh, Shorty, you shouldn't have done that in the back of Vernon's new truck. Sorry, Vern. Big Duval Ford, Vern, the pick of the litter. Know what I mean? [smack] Mmm. Hey, Vern, before you go in the lake, check it out. You know what these are, Vern? These are life jugs. They're jugs for saving lives. And you'll see them all this summer around public lakes and swimming areas from shore to shining shore. If you see somebody in trouble, Vern, you grab them by this little loop here, and you toss it out to them. They're for saving lives, Vern. And they really work. But you're not supposed to play with them, Vern. You're supposed to play with this. [squeaking] Oh, hi, Vern. Vern, do you realize that your electric heat pump only delivers heat at 90 degrees. Vern, that's less than my body temperature. What you need, Vern, is a new high efficiency gas furnace like mine. It puts out heat at 120 degrees. And it's the lowest cost heat of any system today. Yeah, Vern, gas is the heat to beat. Vern, I don't feel so hot. You ought to put me to bed. Is that good and tight, Vern? That old sucker's got to come out of there. Now, you should have talked to old Ernest first. If you'd only brushed after every meal, got regular checkups, flossed everyday, ate the right kinds of food, and of course drank plenty of milk, all this here wouldn't be necessary. Would it, Vern? OK, you ready? A-one, two, two and half, three. Ready to try it again, Vern? Oh, sorry, Vern. Didn't mean to wake you up. But I just looked in your fridge, and I see where you finally came to your senses and got rid of that old Mountain Dew and made the Mello Yello move. Yeah, Vern, you must have overcome your trauma and regained your brain. Well, Vern, you go on back to sleep and get some rest. And I'll drink, oh, half dozen of these and go on home. Oh, Vern, I like the little bear. [laughs] You buying a new car, Vern? I know. Tysons Toyota might be on the other side of town, but it's worth the drive. Know what I mean? Let me figure this for you. Vern drives 18 mile to Tysons Toyota at $0.20 a mile-- that's government standard-- divided by the accelerated rotation of the Earth minus the frustration factor equals, Vern, you're going to save $53,000 on a $9,000 car. I don't know how them boys stay in business. (SINGING) I-yi-yi-yi. Hey, que pasa, Vern? I assume you are here for the fiesta. Yes, Vern, a couple of close personal amigos and myself are celebrating the fact that Sprite tastes better than 7Up. Because only Sprite has that great lymon taste. Know what I mean? Comprendo? Let the fiesta begin. [metallic clang] (SINGING) I-yi-yi-yi. I-- oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Be prepared, Vern. Be prepared to go to the Scout-O-Rama, Vern, April 16th. There'll be Cub Scouts, and Boy Scouts, and Explorer Scouts, all doing what scouts do best-- camping, and cooking skills, and facepainting, and fun of all kind. So catch the spirit, Vern. April 16th, Scout-O-Rama, know what I mean? You know, Vern, you can make a fire this way. And, boy, is it painful. Ooh. Oh. Ow. Oh, hi, Vern. I was just keeping up with my money because 24 Action News has come up with something custom made for us big time entremanures. It's called "Money Matters in Austin." And it's stuff about money. You know, legal tender, your jack, your wampum, your quest for the long green. It's weeknights on "The Update." And, Vern, "Money Matters" even tracks your preferred interest rates. You know, that's where you might prefer it, but you ain't going to get it. They'll bookkeep you right out of it. Know what I mean? Let's have a camera over here, and then we'll move that way. OK, Jennifer, these attack dogs are really vicious. So I figure we start the story out somewhere along the line of-- - Hey, Vern, check it out. It's Mark Bailey and Jennifer Mills from your friend "Forest PM Magazine." And they're always doing great stories on just about everything. Like for instance, right now they're doing one on attack dogs. And, Vern, never do this to an attack dog. Oh no, Ernest, Ernest, don't-- [vicious growls] He has such a way with animals. It's almost psychic. ERNEST: Woo hoo, whoa, hua. (SINGING) Tune in June-- Oh, hi, Vern. Hope you don't mind me using your shower, but since you got that new gas water heater, you've got plenty of hot water. It's twice as fast and a whole lot cheaper. Know what I mean? You know, I'm going to have to call the gas company and get me a gas water heater. Vern, would you mind handing me that cream rinse? Thank you. [sings] (SINGING) Mm, Alouette gen-- Oh, hi, Vern. Check it out, Vern. Ernest goes artist to help celebrate National Ice Cream Month. That's right, Vern. And this is my contribution to ice cream, the beautiful. They've dedicated a month, and I've dedicated my entire life to ice cream as art-- ice cream-o de art-o. Comprendo? And you know the best part, Vern, is you can eat your mistakes. Know what I mean? [smacking] (SINGING) Alouette-- hm. [WHISTLING THE THEME FROM "THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW"] Oh, hi, Vern. You know, I just got through watching "The Andy Griffith Show" on WDBJ 7. That's right, Vern, the Mayberry sensation on Your Hometown Station. I watch it every weekday afternoon. They got Aunt Bea, and Barney, and Goober, and the whole gang. I know what, Vern. Let's me and you play Mayberry. I'll be Andy, and you be Dopey. [whistling] [clock ticking] [music playing] Ho ho ho, Vern. It's me Ernest, Santa's little party helper. And look what I brought you, some chips, and party dips, and everything. Merry Christmas, Vern. You know, Vern, it's that time of year-- Hi, Vern. --when people get together to celebrate with their friends and have a good time and-- hey, look, Vern. There's Keenan, and Craig, and Jerry. It looks like the whole Channel 40/Channel 29 News Center-- hey, mister. Hey, listen, Vern, if you need any more chips or anything, I'm right next door. It's no trouble at all. Just give me a call. Merry Christmas, Vern. PARTY GUESTS: (SINGING) --the ancient yuletide carol. Fa la la-- ERNEST: Vernon! Vernon! Open the door, Vern. Happy New Year, Vernon. Open up, Vernon. Open up. Merry Christmas, Vernon. It's me, Santa's little helper. , Look I brought you something festive for the season, some Roberts Peppermint Stick ice cream, and egg nog, and sour cream. Just the thing, Vern, when those neighbors drop in. Roberts products are great for Christmas, Vern. Ho ho ho. No, [blows] no, [blows] no. Vernon, Vernon, I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past, and it has come to my attention that you have not installed a high tech gas furnace. For this, Vernon, you will pay. Know what I mean? Hey, Vern. Wake up, Vern. It's Christmas morning. Merry Christmas, Vern. Vern, there's a big hole in your roof, and there's reindeer all over the house. And, Vern, do you have a big pooper scooper? OK, Vern, let me explain this again. Sneaky old Mr. Staleness tries to get into this bag of Guy's potato chips to take out all the freshness. Do-doop do-do-do-do. That's why Guy's came up with this new stay fresh peel-and-seal strip. You just eat here, and peel here, and seal here. Uh oh, it's sneaky old Mr. Staleness again. Do-doop do-do-do-do. I can't get in. I can't get in. Oh, hi, Vern. I was just getting in shape for my big bowling tournament next week. That's why I'm training on Cream o'Weber Hi-Land cottage cheese. It's got your protein. It's got your calcium. It's got your primo taste. We are talking endurance insurance. Know what I mean? Yes, sir, Vern, it won't be long before I'm a lean mean bowling machine. Know what I mean? Hey, Vern, it's about time you got home. Your old buddy Ernest has got to catch a ride down to First Federal Savings. Buddy, they have got everything. They've got your fast line. They got your friendly folks. Nice muu-muu, Mrs. Johnson. They've got your automatic teller machine. [cash register dings] And they've got my checking account. And they'll even help me, Vernon, if I'm a little short. We gotta kill them, Vern. Wipe them out. Nip them in the bud and make them scream. We've got to get Dallas clean. It's a war on weeds, Vern, a war on weeds. They're in your yard. They're in the alley. They should be on your mind. It's a war on weeds. We've got to weed them out. Go ahead. Make my day. Hey, Vern. Boy, Vern-- VERN: [moans] Being in the hospital is sure rough duty, huh? Well thank goodness "MASH" comes on every weeknight on WDBJ 7 Your Hometown Station, with Hawkeye, and Hot Lips, and the whole gang. VERN: [painful cries] What a riot, huh? You know, Vern, if I can swing it, I'm going to try to come down here every night and watch "MASH" with you. Don't that sound like fun? Let's see your chart here, Vern. Hey, Verne, it says here that you're getting 50 depositories a day. Where are you putting them things anyway? VERN: [moans] Well, Vern, you missed "News 7." While you were out here piddling around with this old bureau, "News 7's" bureaus were filing reports from hometowns all over the Old Dominion, from the Western Virginia bureau, from the central Virginia bureau. And their Richmond bureau keeps me constantly covered in our commonwealth's capital. They're your hometown station, Vern. They got you covered. Zappo. Well, I don't know, Vern. It kind of looks kind of artsy. Know what I mean? Vernon. Vernon. Hey, Vern. Hey, Vernon. Vern. Vern, I'm trapped in here with all this Purity ice cream. Don't send help. Know what I mean? Vern. Vern, you forgot your mop, Vern. Vernon. Hey, Vern. Vernon. Vern, oh. Hey, Vern, look what I found in my daddy's closet. You know, I bet you this is from the big one. You know, WW II. Boy, I bet them were some great times. I know, because I never miss "Hogan's Heroes" on WDBJ 7. You know, with Shultz, and Hogan, and Commandant Klink. "Hogan's Heroes," weekdays on Your Hometown Station. You know, Vern, this must be some kind of a cigarette lighter. [gunshots] I know nothing. I see nothing. Hey, Vern, looks like you're turning into quite the little shopper. Look at those casabas. But, Vern, them diet colas you got are flatter than a pancake and sweet-- eww. Tab is different, Vern. It don't have near as much NutraSweet as them other colas. And with just one refreshing calorie, Tab should make up for this frozen walnut cream cake with the double fudge center. Lighten up, Vern. Know what I mean? (CRYING) Hey, Vern. It's rich. It's creamy. It's Purity's premium ice cream in eight delicious flavors. Mm mm mm mm mm. Don't forget, Vern, this is Purity's premium ice cream. And these, Vern, are surely, truly happy tears. Know what I mean? Hey, Vern, look down the pier. You know who that is? That's Channel 5's Dave Brown, the Valley sports pro. Vern, he's the best in all the Valley sports and the big time sports too. Know what I mean? But when it comes to fishing, Dave's a rookie. Because, Vern, fishing ain't a sport. Fishing is a art. Know what I mean? [scream] [splash] Big fish, big bait, know what I mean? Whoa ho. [splash] Boy, Vern, you sure got a lot of stale old stuff down here. I'm going to stockpile this place with my personal favorite, Verne, Sprite. Yeah, Vern, grapes are out and lymons are in. Know what I mean? First you must let it breathe. [hiss] Enough. Here, Vern, sample the clear taste of Sprite, presumptuously tart, yet playfully demure. Ah. Know what I mean? Dear Channel 5, Vern and me watch "Eyewitness News" every night. That Peter Torgerson is a real pro. Do you think I could have the name of his barber? And Jane Weaver, [sighs] what a reporter. I just love her. And when she's on "Eyewitness News" my heart skips a beat. Love, Ernest. Know what I mean? Hey, Vern, your old buddy Ernest is going to bike down to Salley's food store to do a little grub grabbing. You know, Vern, Salley's is beating or matching every major advertised price in town at all three convenient locations. They're right here in the neighborhood, Vern. So I can save some cash and be back in a flash. You need anything, Vern? Because the Salley shuttle is now leaving. Salley's Food Store, Vern, where the savings are in the bag not in your mind. Know what I mean? [whistling] REPORTER (ON TELEVISION): The armed robbery began-- Boy, Vern, this "Crimestopper" segment on "24 Action News" has really been a big help to Austin. Know what I mean? They offer a reward and everything. REPORTER (ON TELEVISION): A masked gunman entered the store-- Wait a minute, Vern. Where were you last Thursday night? Weren't you wearing a pink beret and rubber shoes? Got cha! I'm sorry, Vernon, it's for your own good. Crimestoppers-- 4-7-2-T-I-P-S. All right, Vern. Crime stopping is a thankless job, but somebody has got to do it. Know what I mean? REPORTER (ON TELEVISION): Dark colored gloves, a black leather-- Hey, Vern, I have become a master of ventriloquism. I am going to drink from this glass of water whilst Bobo here talks. We offer for your approval this outstanding selection of gifts from First Federal Savings. They're practical, priceless, and free to our customers. Why? Because that's the way we do it in the zone. How did he know that? No Bobo. I get the gifts. You're just the dummy. - [snarls] - OK. OK. I'm the dummy. You get the gifts. [whistling] Hey, Vern, cataloging the old rare stamp collection, eh? Oh, now that's a good investment, kind of like my money market account at First Federal. Not only do I get high interest rates, but I've got my choice of a free GE TV, Weber grill, and a whole lot of other stuff. Of course, I chose my personal favorite, this Hoover vacuum cleaner-- free, Vern. Boy, it sure does suck them up. [vacuum whirs] Well, Vern, you, you should have had them glued down. Know what I mean? [bag rattles] [sobs] All gone. [crying] You know, Vern, on these hallowed walls hang the very people that shaped and sculpted my world view, the people who made me the very person I am today. There was Pop, and Mom, and Davy Crockett, and Abe Lincoln, and Ron Stone, and Bill Balleza. And who can forget Jan Carson? And you know, I think Ron, Bill, and Jan have had the most influence on my life, Vern, because they're on the TV, Channel 2 News. Know what I mean? Yeah, Vern, I keep up. I am paced with the heartbeat of the entire low country. "News 4" is on your side beaming current events back to your old buddy Ernest. Yeah, they're on your side east of the Cooper, in Charleston, and North Charleston, in Summerville, and Goose Creek. "News 4" is mobile whilst I remain immobile. Any closer to Easy Street, Vern, and I'd have to change my zip code. Oh, oh, ho. Two-- three-- you're looking tired, Vern. Better knock off for lunch. Look what your old buddy Ernest brought you, Vern-- some Marva Maid Slendo 2% low fat milk. The fresher one, Vern, made right here at home by your nearby Marva Maid dairies. It gets you a-movin' movin', movin', movin, movin, movin, movin' movin. Marva Maid-- Marva Maid Slendo 2% low fat milk, terrific taste, Vern, and absolutely perfect for us health nuts. Know what I mean? [clucks] I'm movin', movin', movin', movin', movin', movin', movin'. I'm for you, Vern. Big fun, Vernon, at the Ernest P. Worrell annual-- only once a year-- fish fry. It's tradition, Vern, just like Pine State buttermilk. I like it in my batter. I like it on my slaw. I like it in my dressing. And I love it in my hushpuppies. Mm, mm, mm. I like it straight too. Know what I mean? Hey, Vern, I see you brought the younguns in for a double dip of that Braum's ice cream. They're humongous, ain't they? And big too. Let old Ernest help, OK? Now let's see. Who got the vanilla? Who got the butter pecan? And who got the strawberry? And, Vern, I bet you got the chocolate. Don't you want yours, Vern? Well pay the lady. Hey, Vern, let's go bowling for the Buddies of Nashville, Vern. It's for a good cause. And every bowling alley in Nashville is going to participate February 12th through the 26th. A lot of fun, Vern, and a lot of prizes. So if you've got any spare time, let's split and pound some pins. What do you say? [pop] [thud] Uh oh. Did you hear the doorbell, Vern? Hey, Vern, where is that wife of yours with that pizza pie? You know, I'll bet she's having trouble with that old hunk of junk you drive. You should have talked to your old buddy Ernest first. Know what I mean? Then you'd have you a classy new car from Stenger's Ford. Where is that woman with that pizza pie? Yeah, there's nothing like a classy new car from Stenger's Ford and a good hot pizza pie. Vern, what's these dead minnows doing on my pizza pie? [coughs] Gosh, Vern, you trying to kill us all? Walking around all the time with that weed hanging out of your mouth. Don't you know how deadly that thing is? You're just asking for a case of the big C-- Cancer City, Chemotherapy Hotel. [coughs] I care about you, Vern. That's why I'm warning you. You better give up them cigarettes, buddy, or the groundhogs will be bringing you your mail. Know what I mean? One-- oh, hi, Vern. Is this your piggy bank? Well I was just trying to make sure you gave your fair share to the United Way, Vern. Because I know how tight you are. We've all got to give our fair share, Vern. And I'll bet your fair share is right in that piggy bank. Oh, I wasn't really going to break it. Here. Oops. Look what mean old Mr. Gravity did. Vern, hey, Vern. Wha ha ha! It's me, Vern, your old buddy Ernest. And look, I've got everything ready for our big camp out in your back yard. See, I've got everything, every delicious flavor of Trauth fruit drink. Because I know it's your favorite, and you don't want to be without it. I got you orange. I got you grape. I got you jungle juice. And got you a lemonade. I didn't remember everything, Vern. I didn't remember pest control. Did you remember pest control? Hey, Vern, I see you're having one of them fancy parties. Going to have all of your friends walking around talking big and acting rich. And speaking of rich, Vern, has that radio advertising convinced these big time entremanures to invest with you? You know, Vern, a bank ain't the only place to put your money. And you know what they say about banks and their preferred rates. You might prefer them, but you ain't going to get them. Know what I mean? But with Kemper, there's lots of ways for people to get bigger returns on their money. And that means megabucks in your pocket, Vern. Know what I mean? And, Vern, since I opened my IRA with you, next month we'll do this at my place. Know what I mean? Superb. I guess you figured out that my own special interest group Purity Lovers has rallied in support of me, Ernest P. Worrell, for president. And when I'm living in the White House, Vern, my cabinet will be full of those guaranteed Purity products. And speaking of living in the White House, Vern, I think I'll get Ronnie on the horn and find out where that fuse box is, or if there's any septic tank problems, or anything like that. (SINGING) A hail to the chief. He's your buddy and your neighbor. [laughs] Faster. Faster. Boy, Vern, these family picnics are a whole bunch of fun, aren't they? It's a good thing there was a Shop-a-minit close by, too. Because I had to go get more soft drinks and wienies. Know what I mean? Boy, that Shop-a-minit has everything, Vern. I mean everything. You know the old saying, there ain't no limit at Shop-a-minit. You know, Vern, all of a sudden I, I don't feel so good. (SINGING) Happy Pine State to you. Happy Pine State to you. Happy Pine State, dear Vernon. Happy Pine State to you. Happy Pine State to you. Hey, Vernon, thanks for saving me a seat. Mm mm mm. I love these Braum's hamburgers. Did you see her fix these Braum's hamburgers? She made them just the way I like them. Cooked them one at a time, all the fixings, none of them conveyor belts, no automatic burger machines, none of that factory stuff, just a real hamburger made by a real human being. What will they think of next? Hey, Vern, how do you like my new pick-em-up truck? Ain't she a honey? You know what that is, Vern? That is a Stenger's Ford pick-em-up truck. It's got your heavy duty rear suspension. It's got your twin I-beam front suspension. And it's America's number one best-selling pick-em-up. And you can save so much scratch down there at Stenger's, Vern, that you can afford to invest in some of these object-o de art-os Comprendo? Look at it, Vern. Look at it. Oh, hi, Vern. You know, Vern, entertainment is very important to us as human beings. That's why I've invented this nuclear TV. When I'm through, Vernon, I'll be able to zap TV 24's Elvira, mistress of the dark, temptress of the night, right into my own living room, in person, in the flesh. Waa ha ha ha ha ha. Elvira's where it's at, Vern. Know what I mean? Waa-a ha ha ha ha ha-a. Oh, hi, Vern. You know that Purity has really done it now, buddy. Purity milk now comes in a solid yellow jug that keeps light out. And you know what light does to the flavor of milk. See, this here solid yellow jug protects that fresh Purity taste, Vern. So get Purity's new solid yellow jug. And then it won't matter, Vernon, how long your fridge light stays on. It does stay on, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. You know, Vern, Thanksgiving is the time of year when we should all be thankful for the things we have in life, like an all natural gas home. A gas home, Vernon, that keeps us warm and cozy all winter long at such a low, low cost. Yeah, Vern, I'm thankful for natural gas. Shall I carve? What'll it be, Vern, light or dark? Guess who, Vern. Guess again. It's me, Vern, your old buddy Ernest. And look what I brought you, Vern. Some of that delicious Purity chocolate milk. And it's the real thing, Vern. None of that fake stuff, it's a real deal, made with real chocolate and whole, sweet Purity milk. Mm mm mm mm. You know what, Vern, it's just exactly like Mom used to make. Know what I mean? Happy Easter, Vern. I like to eat the eyes first. [smacking] Yeah, Vern, I've been wrong. But I see the error of my ways. Maybe it was just too many bad jalapenos. But now I see the light, Vern, and its on Channel 4, with "Wednesday's Child," and "Telepolled", and "Call 4," and that "News 4" news team. And now, Vern, 4's got me forever. And now, Vern, I'm switching you to 4-- forever. Haha. You hear me, Vern? Forever. Forever. [laughs] Forever, Vern. Hey, Vern, let your old buddy Ernest serve you an ice cold Pine State fruit drink. It's only $5, Vern. Come on, this is real Pine State fruit drink, Vern-- frosty, cold, and good. I got your orange. Got your grape. Got your fruit punch. And got your lemonade, Vern. Just $5 a glass. Come on, this stuff is so good it ought to be $10 a glass. I know what they charge for it in the store, Vern. A fellow's got to make a little profit, don't he? Know what I mean? [clucks] Hey, Vern, Bar working on the old tum tum, eh? VERN: [grunts] Should have talked to old Ernest first. Know what I mean? You know what you need, Vernon? Some Pine State sweet acidophilus milk. Sweet acidophilus will help you digest some of that junk food you're so fond of. And besides that, it's low fat. We're talking minute caloric intake, Vernon. Pine State sweet acidophilus milk is as good for your insides as it is for your outside. Vern? You OK, Vern? Hey, Vern, I guess you know who that is. That's Rick Diaz, the Eyewitness News director. He heads the valley's number one news team. He's one of Channel 5's finest and a close personal friend of mine. I suppose you'd like to meet Rick. Hey, Rick, baby, what's happening? Hey, Vern, good to see you. How you doing? Good to see you again. [laughs] Hey, Rick, your magic. Don't ever change. We'll do lunch at Padre. (SINGING) O-- Alo-- oh, hi, Vern. I was just practicing my hula bula dance in case I win big in the Bottoms Up instant win game at Convenient Food Mart. It's easy, Vern. All you got to do is peel the seal on the bottom of your cup to see what you won. You can win candy, and snacks, and chips, big bucks, and one of five big trips to Hawaii. Let's see what you won. (SINGING) Alo-- Well hey, Vern. What is that? Is that one of them new Braum's country fried steak sandwiches? Yeah, it is. Mm, they are good, aren't they? A real Braum's country fried steak sandwich, with tomatoes, and lettuce, and the works. How's them fries? Hold still, Vern. This won't hurt a bit. You know, Vern, I've been watching Dr. Red Duke on "24 Action News Health Watch." And that Dr. Red really knows his stuff. Know what I mean? He has taught me so much about staying healthy and keeping in shape that I feel confident, Vern, in performing a little minor surgery. Now this will only sting for a second. Well ease up, Vern. Vern? Vern? Looks like you need mouth-to-mouth resignation. Now hold your tongue down. Hey, Vern, cooking out again eh? Are you crazy, man? Didn't you hear Robin Reed's "Pinpoint Weather Forecast" on "News 7?" That Robin's got him a computer, Vernon. The man is wired for weather. Didn't you hear Robin say that it was going to rain any second? We are talking pinpoint, Vernon. Next time talk to the old buddy Ernest first. Know what I mean? I believe them hot dogs are about ready, Vern. 67. Oh, hi, Vern. Just getting in shape. You know, it's important to stay in shape, Vern. That's why I always eat plenty of these Country Fresh Lite goodies like cottage cheese and yogurt. Yeah, Vern, Country Fresh Lite keeps me in such good condition that I can do just about anything. Country Fresh Lite keeps you living right. Know what I mean? One, two-- Hey, Vernon. Look here, buddy. Have you given your fair share to the United Way? You gotta give your fair share, Vernon, because if you don't pitch in your part, and I don't pitch in my part, these poor people won't have a part to pitch in. Get earnest about the United Way.
