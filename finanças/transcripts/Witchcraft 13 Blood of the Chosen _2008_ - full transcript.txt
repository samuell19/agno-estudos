(dramatic music) (whooshing) (ominous music) (moaning) - Usually, I have a good sense of people, Leandra, but you came out of nowhere. - Are you complaining? - I don't know. It's like you hunting me down in that club. - When I see something I want, I go for it. - You're like a sexual predator. I like it. - Do you have a sense of me now, Clive? - I think so. Let's move this to the room. - Why bother? Let's keep it out here. (moaning) How's that for a sexual predator? - It's perfect. (laughing) (moaning) (eerie music) What's the deal? - Nothing. Nothing at all. (yelling) (squelching) (groaning) - Jesus fucking Christ! (groaning) (menacing music) - Just the mind and body of a man even with a heart of a warlock. (exciting rock music) (people applauding) (party commotion) (party beat music) (party commotion) - Will? I mean, Mr. Spanner. We're gonna be moving the celebration down to Sully's Bar and Grill. Why don't you come out with the rest of the firm and celebrate the verdict? - I would love it, but I've got a ton of post-trial paperwork to catch up on. - Even after you win, you still keep working. - You know. (partiers chanting) - Will, I just wanted to talk the time to thank you for giving me the opportunity to work for you and learn from you and to tell you how much I admire you. You really are something special. - Well thank you, Laura. I appreciate that. You know, sometimes I think your uncle and I were the only guys to go to law school to help people out. - Are you sure you don't wanna come out with us? I promise we'll have a great time. - It'll be magic. But really, I've got a ton of paperwork to catch up on and I'm meeting an old friend tonight. I haven't seen him in quite awhile. I get the feeling he needs my help. - There you go again, always wanting to help someone. You have a good night, Mr. Spanner. - Thanks Laura. You have a goodnight too. - Hey, Laura, you ready? - Yeah. (party commotion) - Shit, I'm late. (exciting rock music) - Well, I don't think one beer's going to be enough for the both of us. - Well what is it I can get for you? - You already have. I'll be at the table over there in the corner. - I'll be right there. I like her style. - I like her looks. - Looks can be deceiving though. You know that. I'll tell you what, I'll take another beer. Gracias. (somber music) You know, Skylar is a very intriguing name. - You have no idea, Ben. - Oh yeah? Wait a minute, did I tell you my name? Hey, there's my friend, Will. - Good to see you, man. - What's up, man? How you doing? - Good, good, good. - Well, I hope all that work I did for you paid off in the case. - We got the word today, we won. We won big time. Thanks for the help. - Thank you. It's a little more than I expected. - I threw a bonus in there for a job well done and I like to take care of my own. - Awesome, man, I could really use it, thanks. - Sure. You know, now that we've won this case, I feel like such a weight's been lifted off me. - Really? That weight that actually flew off of you I think landed right on me. - Really? Why? - I don't know, man. I just feel like the past couple days there's been something on top of me and behind me and I can't shake it. - Depression? - No, actually I've been pretty happy. I don't know. All this power I have inside me, it feels like it's just gonna fucking burst out of me and I don't know what to do. Do you have problems controlling your powers? - Every day. You know my power comes from evil. I hate that and I try to use them for good, but it just doesn't work that way. Maybe that's why I burry myself in my work. Maybe that's why I only take cases from people who are good people. Maybe I'm feeling like that suppresses that dark side of my destiny, you know? - I don't know, man. We've walked the same path in so many ways, but yours is on such a higher plain. - It affects me at every level of my life. I thought I had a really good thing going with Kelly. For a few years, you know, my fiance. But this curse, this destiny of mine, blew that too. - Are you having feelings of physical discomfort? Like somebody feels when they have a bum knee in bad weather? - No. Why? - I don't know, I feel like there's something up in our world of our kind. I really want you to be careful out there. - Don't worry about me. You be careful. - Thanks man. Glad you're my friend. I'm glad you're my client too. - Well, friends don't let friends drive in that condition. Come on, I'll give you a ride. - Well, actually, man, don't take offense but I would rather have a ride with her. - You go, buddy. Keep in touch. - All right, will do. (somber beat music) - [Radio Announcer] Witnesses claim the suspect carried to bobcat heads and squirted a milky white liquid. The exact symbolism which is still unknown. And in local news, another body was discovered last night in the Piney Point subdivision. The victim's heart was found missing yet again. - Shit. I wanted to give that to Ben. - [Radio Announcer] Investigators had no comment on the matter when questioned. - Maybe I can catch him before he leaves with that girl. (somber beat music) Hey, did that Ben guy, the one who was talking to the woman who was just here, did he ever leave? - Yeah, he left with the girl that he was talking to. - That was fast. - Actually, you might be able to catch up to him. They headed out on foot down the street. - Thanks. (somber beat music) Ben! (ominous music) Ben! Jesus. (foreboding music) Homicide, please. I'd like to report a murder. Why? (knocking) Officer Gentry, Officer White. Look, I'm willing to help you guys out but I told you everything I know last night at the crime scene. - Yes, we know, and you've been very helpful. However, some things have come to our attention that we'd like to talk to you about. - Okay, sure. - We'd like to keep this conversation a bit under wraps, if you don't mind. - I understand. Please, have a seat. - There are a couple things that have been bothering us. I don't know if you're aware of this, but there have been a series of killings, just like your friend's, in many of the surrounding counties. - All with their hearts ripped out? - Exactly. - I'm not surprised that you have not gotten wind of this. Communication between the surrounding counties, police departments is horrible and they don't help each other out too much, so we've been slowly piecing this thing together. Your friend, Ben, he was the fifth one. - I hope you guys get a break soon and find something out, but why come to me? - With the way the victims are being killed. - With their hearts ripped out. - Right. We can't help but think this might be some sort of ritualistic thing. - Listen, I'll be straight with you, Spanner. I used to know Detective Lutz. - Lucy or her brother? - The whole family, actually. - How is she? I haven't thought of her in years. - I haven't talked to Lucy in a couple years since we broke up. Coming from an entire family of cops, I guess dating one isn't the right thing to do socially. - She was tough as nails. - Without a doubt. Well, while we were dating I heard some pretty fantastic stories about this very unique lawyer named Will Spanner. - Well, being the brilliant detectives that we are, we put two and two together. Last night when we met, we figured you might have some ideas on this because of your background. And because of the other times you helped the police force out. - Yeah, I've helped the police on a couple of bizarre cases. And the Lutz's and I had some very strange experiences, but based on my experience and my knowledge, these killings didn't have anything mystical. - I guess it was worth a shot. Listen, if you come across any information or have any of these strange feelings. - [Will] Strange feelings? - I'm sorry, I don't know how your magic works. - Look, I'm not David Copperfield. But I know what you mean. If I hear anything or feel anything, I'll give you guys a call. Ben was a friend of mine. I want to help you guys do whatever I can to help you catch his killer. - Thank you very much, Mr. Spanner. We'll be seeing you again. - Thank you. - So what do you think? - I think we oughta keep tabs on Spanner. I have a feeling he might lead us somewhere. - So White, you got a strange feeling about him, huh? (chuckling) Huh? - Shut up, man. - Aw, yeah buddy. That's interesting. I like that. - Here you go, Mr. Spanner. - Thanks, Laura. Laura, thank you for all the extra overtime this week. I really appreciate that. - No problem whatsoever. I actually wanted to ask you if you needed any more help tonight. It looks like you finished such a long day already. - Yeah, I have, but you've done plenty, really. You're young, go, enjoy the night. Get out of here. (sensual music) - I am young and I wanna enjoy the night. But I want to enjoy it with you. - Laura. I hired you here because I'm a good friend of your uncle and because I know you have what it takes to be a fantastic lawyer. And that's why I hired you here. You are very beautiful and I am very flattered, really. But I can't. I just can't. It wouldn't be appropriate. - I know your fiance left you and you just burry yourself in your work to cover up for that. - Laura, I've watch you grow from a little girl into a woman. - That's what makes it so exciting. (sensual music) - Laura, no, I can't. Okay? Please understand, I just can't. - Okay. I'm sorry, Mr. Spanner. I'll leave you to your work. - Laura. Please, understand, I don't think any less of you. Okay? I want you to stay working here as long as you want. I want you to stay until you feel that you've learned everything that you can. - Thank you, Mr. Spanner. (somber music) I want you, Will Spanner. I don't care what you say. I don't care if it's naughty. (sensual music) (ominous music) (menacing music) - Hey, Will, ever feel like your powers are gonna burst out of you? You broke my heart! See? (yelling) (gasping) (ominous music) - Warlock. (eerie whispering) (thudding) Hello? Is there somebody here? Hello? (ominous music) God, I hate this part. (electrical buzzing) (gasping) (groaning) I hate that shit. Wait a second. Here we go again. (electrical buzzing) (ominous music) (hissing) (foreboding music) Hey! Hey! (whooshing) * I am so desperately lonely * I wish there was a woman I could fuck * * Be so nice if a lady out there would have me * * But it looks like I am shit out of luck * (somber beat music) - So what seems to be the problem? - I think my tire went kablooey. - Well, let's see if you got a spare to replace the one that went "kablooey." (ominous beat music) Well, no tire. Looks like you're out of luck. - Funny, I as just gonna say the same thing to you! (groaning) (menacing music) (tires squealing) (ominous music) - That was last night? Yeah. Total of six. All right, give me the address. Uh huh. All right, I don't know much about this guy, but I'm will to bet he fits the victim's profile. I gotta go. Call me if you find anything new. (somber beat music) - I think Will has the right idea about now. - Knock, knock. We're on duty. But you're right. I would kill for a beer right now. - I know, man. - Excuse me, I'm looking for a small, sexy little blond girl who just walked in here. Have you seen her? - Oh yeah, perfect rack? Buddy, I think she's staring at you right now. (somber bar music) - All right, thanks. - Oh yeah. - Hi there. I was wondering if I could join you, if you don't mind. - Please, do. (buzzing) Will. - Now how do you know my name? - Let's just say I have a knack for knowing these kinds of things. - My favorite beer, very impressive. But you seem to have me at a disadvantage. You know my name but I don't know yours. - My name is Keely. - Keely. Very nice. A pleasure to meet you. - Well, not yet, but it might be. (chiming) - Keely? So tell me something else about myself. - Well, you're a very hard worker. Who likes to please people, whatever it takes. - Yeah, how about that? - But there is a bad side to you. A powerful side that at times your feel you have trouble controlling. - Really? - Yeah. You have wants and urges. You burry them deep into your dreams until they just wanna explode. - So what do I do about that? - You have to take control of your urges and never let go. Only then can you know. - Know what? - That I want you. - Why me? - Because guys like you have a heart. I just wanna be a part of it. And because you're a very hard worker who likes to please people, whatever it takes. - So now what? (sensual beat music) (moaning) - I need to have you. (sexual moaning) (ominous music) - Son of a bitch. (groaning) (foreboding music) (yelling) (menacing music) (demonic laughing) (electrical crackling) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) - You are nothing! You are so going-- (whooshing) (sighing) - All right, Eldridge, I hope you can help. (ominous music) (bongo music) - Will Spanner. What brings you back to me? - I seek answers, Eldridge. I'm lost. - Well the only thing we can do here is help you to be found. - I don't understand what that means. - Me neither. (laughing) - It's been too long, my friend. - Have a seat. So, what seems to be the problem? - Ben. My friend, Ben. He was killed, murdered actually. - I remember Ben. He quite the crusty character. - Well he was a little rough around the edges, but he was my friend. We shared the same gift. - Gift? - Affliction, curse, whatever you wanna call it, he could do it too. - You still forget, Will, no one has what you have. - So you keep telling me. I also found out that his was the latest in a series of murders. - These murders, how were they performed? Is there some ritualistic style to them? - Nothing like I've ever known. No candles, no stones, no markers, no symbols. Just their hearts ripped out and gone. - Their hearts ripped out? - Does that mean something? - What else do you know? - All the other victims were male and they were associated with this medallion. (ominous music) - Oh my God, this is the medallion from your parent's coven. - I know. The Adams, my adoptive parents. - No. Your birth parents were associated with this coven. Your father was the leader. - Father. He was their leader. He drove them mad. He's the reason they're dead. I've disowned the past. I am not my father. I'm Ben's friend and I'm here for answers. - I had no idea that this practice still existed. - What practice? - Hundreds of years ago, there was a war between the two most powerful covens, each of them hoping to wipe the other off the face of the earth. For this time, the one that they worshiped flourished with evil. It was a horrible time for everyone else because the way in which this could be accomplished was so terrifying, unthinkable, no one was able to confront these powerful warlocks. - How is it done? - The coven that originally initiated the war, they were called The Order of the Crimson Hearts. They were powerful. They had a powerful leader and a select group of hand-picked soldiers to carry out that mission. Their mission, to take their rivals powers and bring them back to their master. This way he could rule over all. They did this by collecting the hearts of their rivals. Ripping them out and consuming them whole. - My God. - They were only foot soldiers. They were holy vessels, carrying the power back to their masters. They could not use the new power. Only the master can harness the powers from the soldiers. - I think I may have a pretty good idea of who the foot soldiers are. I don't know who their leader is. So how long does it go on? When does the killing stop? - Well it can stop once they've located the chosen one. They then have enough power to rid the world of all of us. - So we need to find the leader of this coven. - Will, no one ever knows who that is. If they do, it's probably too late for them to do anything about it. - And if they find the chosen one, we're screwed. - Basically, yes. But that's not our biggest concern. - I knew you were gonna say that. - If the two most powerful ones fornicate, they will fulfill the ultimate prophecy. They will conceive a child that could rule the world under evil. - So our best bet is still to find the leader to he coven. - Well, it sounds like you've excepted this challenge. - Well if it means finding Ben's killer, save a couple other people in the process, yeah, I am. - It also appears you're becoming more accepting to your, how do you say? Gift? - Okay, Eldridge, what ancient advice do you have for me? - Well, the advice that I have for you is not ancient nor in the form of witchcraft. - Well? - Be prepared, Will. Be prepared. (ominous music) - Fucking chosen one son-of-a-bitch. (crickets chirping) (eerie music) - Tonight has been slow. But things should pick up. - I do not think the leader will be pleased with what we brought tonight. - I know. But we must continue the slaughter so we can rule over all. The only thing we can do is continue the wrath on our prey and consume their hearts. - We must finish this war soon, so that we too can experience this true power of which our leader speaks. - There are some perks to this mission. It is not only easy, it is pretty funny. - These warlocks are nothing but men when it comes down to it. They fall for ever trick in the book. - Trust me, it doesn't tale much to lure them in. - It's so amazing when I consume their powers. - I know what you mean. I feel invincible. - You will never guess who I have had the pleasure of being with. - Hopefully this one is worthy of spreading your legs for. Some of them are gross. - You have no idea. I believe I may have found that which our leader so blindly seeks. - Who is it? - The chosen one. His name is Will Spanner and he has he sacred markings. He's a powerful warlock. I have firsthand experience. - Silence! (ominous music) - Excuse me, Mr Spanner? Mr. Will Spanner? - Yes? How can I help you? - Yes, if you're not too busy, I have a problem I was hoping you could help me with. - Sure, have a seat. - My name is Dolores Stevens. I guess you don't come across to many Doloreses nowadays. - You'd be surprised. I knew a Dolores a few years ago. - Strange. - That was one word you could use to describe her. - Anyway, the reason I came to see you today is that I heard, along with your legal work, you also did some investigative work. - That's true, but as you can see, I've got a pretty heavy caseload already. - I could only imagine. I heard about your latest victory and that's one of the reasons I chose your firm. - Well that's actually been kind of a mixed blessing and a curse. But what's your situation? - Well, my father just passed away, so now both of my parents are gone. - I'm very sorry to hear that. - Thank you. So now I have the task of taking care of the wills and everything else that goes along with it when your parents pass on. - I do will work. - Actually, I have that under control at the moment with another firm. My problem is my brother. - Okay. - You see, my brother's been missing by choice for awhile now and I was hoping that you could help me find him so that I could finish all this with my parents. - Well actually, Miss Stevens, I know several private investigators. - I understand, but the reason I came to you is that before my brother went missing, he was involved in the goth scene and possibly even some sort of cult. It may even be related to witchcraft of some sort. Before you turn me down, flat, just let me let you know that some people at the police department but me in your direction. - What? - They had nothing but nice things to say about you and how you've helped them with these sort of things in the past. - I bet they do. - Please, I can pay you anything. - It's not about the money. - Please, Mr. Spanner. I'm at the end of my rope. Believe it or not, I still love my brother and I want to see him again. He's the only family I have left. - Of course I'll help you, Miss Stevens. - Thank you, Mr. Spanner. - Please, call me Will. - Thank you, Will. - Laura, will you come in here for a second? - Yes, Mr. Spanner? - Laura, will you run a check on... Sorry, what was your brother's name? - Jason Stevens. - Jason Stevens. Last whereabouts unknown. Start with the local counties and we'll go from there. - Okay, no problem. Will do, Mr. Spanner. - If you go ahead and give me your contact information and I will call you as soon as we find anything out. - It looks like you've got your hands full. - Nothing I can't handle. - It looks like you could use a break. - You could say that again. - How about tonight? - Excuse me? - Dinner at my place? (chuckling) - Really, I have such a huge caseload right now. - I have some things of my brother and it might help you with your investigation. I could give it to you. - That sounds very enticing, Miss Stevens, but I just don't think-- - Well, look, you've got my contact information and if you feel up to it, come to my house around 8 o'clock. I'll be waiting for you. - Fair enough. - You're a good man, Will Spanner. It's rare to find a man with a heart like yours. - You have no idea. (phone ringing) - Hello? What's up, Will? It's Will Spanner. - Great. - Listen, I don't appreciate you going around telling people about my personal life and what I may have done in the past. - What the hell are you talking about? - Don't play dumb with me. I talk to you guys and you know in the past that I worked with Lutz, but now I've got some woman coming into my office telling me that I have connections and powers to help her. - Hey man, I seriously don't know what you're talking about. What woman? - Like you don't know. Look, Lutz may have been a little hard-ass at times, but she never broke my personal confidence or my professional confidence. - Hey, listen-- - If I come across anything, I will phone you guys and let you know. But until then, you stay out of my business. - What was that about? - It was Will Spanner, yelling like we told some woman about him and his past. - What? - Exactly. Does he think we would do that? Break his confidence in us? - He is a lawyer. - Fucking jerks, man. So anything interesting happen while I was on the phone? - You were on the phone with Spanner. What the hell interesting could have happened in 30 seconds? Oh mercy, Jesus. - I guess you're right. - Great party, guys! (exciting rock music) (laughing) Who the hell are you? - I'm a gift from a friend. - You gotta be kidding. Who sent you? - I'm here for you. Anything you want. - Is this some kind of a joke? - Why don't you come over here and see how funny I can be? - So how does this work? - Just lie back and relax. I'll take very good care of you. (sensual beat music) - What's wrong? - You're not Todd Covington? - No. No, he's my roommate. - Shit. - Is there a problem? - You have no idea, whatever your name is. - I'm Brad. - And now you're dead. (groaning) - What the fuck is going on? - I take it you're Todd? - Yes? No! You fucking crazy bitch! (gagging) (ominous music) (laughing) (beat music) (doorbell ringing) - So you decided to join me tonight. - I figured, what the hell? I haven't had a home-cooked meal in awhile. - Well get ready to be amazed. I cook up wonders. - I brought a bottle of wine. I hope that's okay. I thought I should bring something. - It's perfect, Will. Why don't you come in? (menacing music) - I got all attached working under cover for about seven and a half years. Taking down every scum-sucking maggot I could get my hands on. - 47 and 0, know what I mean? - Oh yeah. - The hard way. Hey, check it out. There's your boy. Ah. Looks like Spanner's in for some fun. - Mhmm. - So did this Will Spanner and your old girlfriend, Lutz, every hook up? - Whoa. What kind of question is that? - Just curious. Seemed like they knew each other pretty well. - From what I understand, they had a deep respect for each other professionally. Besides, Lucy always said Will was too wimpy for her taste. - Why'd you guys break up? - Seemed like everyone in her life was a cop. Her father was a cop. He got killed in the line of duty. Her brother was a cop and he even worked with Will once. He also got killed in the line of duty, so then there was me. Another cop, right? We dated off and on for awhile. She got called in on the serial killer case and ended up having to go to England to escort the guy back. It was then did it seem like a nice, clean break. - She come back from England? - Yeah. The time she was over there, we were apart, just made things easier for us to go our separate ways. - You miss her? - Every day, man. - Yeah. (somber beat music) - All I have is this old phone bill from a place he used to live at for awhile and his photo. - Thanks. This will help narrow down the investigation. - I just wanna thank you, Will, and tell you how much I appreciate you taking my case. - Just hope I can help. - Would you like some more wine? - Sure. You know, I know what it's like to lose a loved one. - Someone in your family? - My parents. You know, when I was a teenager, just like everyone else, I questioned who I was and where I came from. That's when they told me I was adopted. - Sounds like it was very difficult. - It was, but the Adams' loved me. - The Adams'? - The Adam's adopted me. Spanner was my mother's maiden name. I took that after they died. I think I did it to help me cope. Put my past behind me. They knew that I was different than the other kids. But it never mattered. They always treated me with respect. They always tried to protect me. - That's great, Will. Look at everything that you've accomplished, even with your parents being gone. You have a successful law career. You help people in need. And you've turned into a very handsome man on top of it. - Thank you, but you don't have to butter me up. I've already agreed to take your case. - I wasn't doing it for business reasons, Will. I was saying it because I find you very attractive. - Well I think you're every attractive too, Dolores. But I don't think-- (shushing) - Will, don't think, just drink. (dramatic music) (sexual moaning) (thunder crashing) (menacing music) - I have that Jason Stevens information you requested. - Great. - I actually worked to get some personal data from that passed-due bill you gave me and I actually narrowed it down to a few housed that are not too far away. - Okay, that's great, I could use a break. - How'd you get that passed-due bill anyway? - Miss Stevens gave it to me. - When? I didn't see her leave any information with you when she was here? - We met up last night. She gave it to me then. - I bet she did. - What? - Nothing, do you need me for anything else? - No, thanks, that's it. - Well, if you need me for anything, anything at all, just grab me. - Okay, thanks. (sighing) (ominous music) (eerie music) (knocking) Hello, Jason? Jason? Jason Stevens, hello? Anybody home? My name is Will Spanner, I'm am attorney. There's been a death in your family. You could have inheritance coming. Jason, hello? (eerie music) Ah, shit. (groaning) Oh, good lord. (chiming) (eerie music) (dramatic music) (ringing) - Hi, Will. - I need to talk to you. - Okay, well come in. - I found your brother. - You did? - Yes, Dolores, I did. He's dead. - What? - I'm sorry. He's dead. He was murdered, actually. - Who? - I don't know. But I will find out. - How did he die? - Don't think about how or why. Just leave that to the police. - I just don't believe it. I just can't believe it. I just wish we had more time together, you know? Or at least made better of the time that we had. - It's gonna be okay, Dolores. I'm here for you. - Are you? - Yes. (sobbing) (dramatic music) (suspenseful beat music) Come on, boys, talk to me. This is not over yet. I know there's more coming, come on. (suspenseful beat music) (ominous music) Oh, this can't be good. Eldridge! All right, Eldridge, I hope you have the answer. (foreboding music) - To whom do I owe the pleasure of you gracing me of your presence? - Now if I told you that there would be no mystery. (ominous music) (fizzling) - I'm not the one you're looking for. - I know that. It's just that the leader thinks you're going to be a problem. And we can not have that. - Dear, though nature has been good to me, my powers are weak. They will not be pleasing to your master. - Maybe not. But it will still feel good ripping it out of you. (fizzling) (groaning) (laughing) (suspenseful music) Too bad you are so weak. I would have liked to have taken you down in the bedroom, like most of my victims, but I guess this will have to do. - I'm not too disappointed. - You're not? - No. If I wanted to make love to a glass of water I would've gone to my kitchen. (yelling) (ominous music) - Eldridge! Eldridge, I need your help. I think I... (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (laughing) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (whooshing) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) - I don't know about this. - You don't know about what? - Witches. We're out in the woods, man. (gun clicking) - I'll let you think about that. (chanting foreign language) (menacing music) - We will continue our mission. - We will make the heartless pay. - We will consume the powers of the weak. - We will prey on the unkowning. - We will turn the world upside down without powers. - We will have our evil reign forever and ever. (ominous music) - Not if I can help it! (electrical fizzling) (screaming) - Will Spanner. (crackling) - Keely. I thought we had something special. Let's try and work it out this time. - Now Will, there's not going to be any need for violence. I just don't think we fully understand each other yet. - Oh, I understand and I want no part of your plan. (ominous music) (snickering) - Now, Will, I am sure there's a part of us you want. You are the one. (eerie music) - You are ours. - You make us complete. (fire sizzling) - We have you now. (eerie whispering) - No! (ominous music) - [The Leader] Enough! This has gone on for far too long! It's time to end this. - I couldn't agree more. Show your face! (ominous music) Dolores? (laughing) - Will Spanner. You are amazing. You're not only the best I've ever had, but the most powerful. - First if all, thank you very much, but most powerful what? - As soon as my precious Keely discovered the markings on your neck, we realized that we had completed our mission. - Completed? - With you, we realized we could fulfill the prophecy beyond our imaginations and no one could stand in our way. - What prophecy are you talking about? - Once the leader of the coven has located the chosen one, they will conceive a child. That child will possess all the power and go on to rule the earth under evil. And you, Will Spanner, are the chosen one. - What? (laughing) Oh and it gets better. My name is not Dolores Stevens. It's Dolores Stockton, as in Will Spanner, aka Will Adams, aka Will Churchill, and finally your true name, Will Stockton. The ritualistic descendant of our ruler of all that is dark and reigns supreme in the underworld. - What the hell are you talking about? - You can try to burry who you are by taking on different names and suppressing your evil powers, but you can't hide who you truly are. - I'm nothing like you. You're pure evil. There's no way we are the same. - You're just as evil as me, Will Spanner. Admit it, it takes every ounce of your being to suppress your evil powers. There is a side of you that you let no one else see. Why fight what comes so naturally? And now our child of pure blood will reign over all, brother. - This is not happening. - That night was pure ecstasy. You not only found a deep passion from within you and unleashed it, but you spewed every drop of it. And it won't be long until the purest of evil will be with us. - No! - Spanner is the name you've given yourself. But Stockton is the blood that runs through your veins. - Never! - Your reaction says it all. You know it to be true, Will, you just buried it down, deep inside, for so long. So now come to me and your child, brother. - Stop calling me that! - But it's true. (laughing) - I will never be apart of your evil plan. - Oh well, fine. I have the child, I don't need you anyway. Leandra, Skylar, Keely, take my brother's heart and give me his power! (suspenseful music) (electrical fizzling) (whooshing) (groaning) Keely, now! (electrical fizzling) (screaming) - You're next. (suspenseful music) - Police! Police! Get down! (gunshots booming) (growling) (gunshots booming) - You've got to be kidding me! (whooshing) (crackling) - It's time to end this. - This will never end! - Ow. (eerie music) (fizzling) (ghostly music) - This will never end, Will, you don't have what it takes. - How can you be so sure? - You'd have to beat me at my own game. You don't have it in you. Coward. (groaning) (ghostly yelling) (gagging) (thunder cracking) (squelching) (gasping) What about your child? - [Demonic Voice] It dies with you. (eerie music) (crunching) (yelling) (electrical fizzling) (somber music) - What the hell happened here? Where are we? - Nothing. Nothing happened. - You mean nothing happened? - I mean, nothing happened here. You were both called out on a false alarm. You look kinda hungry. Why don't you go eat something? - Let's go. (somber music) - [Dolores Voiceover] Spanner is the name you've given yourself. But Stockton is the blood that runs through your veins. (menacing music) (ominous music) (exciting rock music) * I'm heading down this path again * * Leaving all my friend behind * I try to ditch again * Know one will ever know * What I've done * Hit the town, they'll think that I'm a savior * * But I can't let it go * I felt so alive with them * So alive * To be * Alone * Locked in a room for moments * So I can fix myself * As I open up the door * I'm hope no one's noticing * And no one's watching me
