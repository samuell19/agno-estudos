Nobody wants to practice. But half of them WhatsApp you all day. Coffee dates also seem to be with you. If they can't match your speed, then why don't you slow down? Me? -I must compromise on quality, sir? -Come on! Do it, Jaggi. Yeah, man. We're stuck on the first act for four days now. And, if you slow down then I can be your lead dancer. How kind of you! All of you need to level up. If folks back home find out that I compromised because I couldn't find a lead dancer, do you know how embarrassing it'll be? Coach... Please find someone good. Or we won't make it to London. Boys, it's quite late. Hurry up, boys. Come on. Boys, let's go. Get the console out. Hide! Hurry up, boys. Come on, it's time for bed. Hurry up. You too. Very good. -Good night, sir. -Good night. Lights off. Time for bed. Come on now. You'll get me killed, Mom. Hang on. I swear, I was about to call you. Your number just popped up on my phone, so I thought I'll call you. Yeah right, liar! You just have only my number. Your son sends you his regards. When did I do that? -Your father sends his blessings. -When did I say that? Fine. The son didn't send his regards nor did the father his blessings. -I'm the only fool here. -Mom... I miss you. But it's pointless trying to get us to talk. Why? Because your husband is an ordinary guy and your son is a star. Yeah, star! You'll get one tight slap. I'm hanging up, okay? Bye. I love you, bye! L... -He hung up. -He's a star after all. Pappi, let's go. Let's go. How many bookings have you taken up this month? It's wedding season. Let's make the most of it. So, how much do you want to earn? Take up important bookings only. The inter-college Bhangra competition is in nine days. I don't want to blow this chance to go to London. Since when are you nervous about Bhangra? Unfortunately, I can't dance alone and win. I need to find the right female lead. DJ Jaggi and Pappi welcome you all! Congratulations to Pinky and Sonu on their wedding. Bhangra, gidda, salsa, rock-n-roll. Come on everybody, on the floor. Come on. Dude, forget it. I'll have to get the party started. Let's play our song. ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl oh, girl♪ ♪Show me what you got♪ ♪Don't be shy oh, girl♪ ♪Show me your moves oh, girl♪ ♪Let's get high on dance oh, girl♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ ♪Show me what you got♪ ♪Don't be shy oh, girl♪ ♪Show me your steps oh, girl♪ ♪Let's get high on dance oh, girl♪ ♪Why just sit♪ ♪And tap your feet to the beat?♪ ♪Show me your moves on the floor♪ ♪And I'll repeat what you do♪ ♪Why just sit♪ ♪And tap your feet to the beat?♪ ♪Show me your moves on the floor♪ ♪And I'll repeat what you do♪ ♪Your body grooves to the rhythm♪ ♪And entices us all♪ ♪If you were going to ignore us anyway♪ ♪Why did you dress up and look so pretty?♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ ♪Show me what you got♪ ♪Don't be shy oh, girl♪ ♪Show me your steps oh, girl♪ ♪Let's get high on dance oh, girl♪ ♪My lover is true to me♪ ♪I see God in my beloved♪ ♪My lover is true to me♪ ♪I see God in my beloved♪ ♪The thread that binds us together♪ ♪Can't be broken♪ ♪My love♪ ♪My lover is true to me♪ ♪I see God in my beloved♪ Simi! Simi, we're in trouble. What happened? Vodka over? No, we've come to the wrong wedding. Binny's wedding function is at the hall outside. Let's go. She's good, Pappi. Take over, I'll go talk to her. What do I play after this? Play whatever you want. She has set the floor on fire. Now they will dance all night. Oh, look at all this amazing food! But it's so crowded. Let's split up. You get the food and I'll get the vodka. Hello there. Jaggi. -Jaggi, are you in London? -No. Amritsar. Then say Sat Sri Akaal. -Okay, Sat Sri Akaal. -Sat Sri Akaal. I want to talk to you. It will cost you. What? Two vodkas, please. Yo, bartender, two large vodkas. Guys, please let me go. Forget the vodka. Forget it! We're calling off the wedding! Is this how you treat the groom's best friend? All of us here are Billu's best friends. Which one are you? I am... The friend from Canada. Yeah, Canada. Yes, yes, Billu had a friend in Canada. Give him his drink. He has come from very far. I did it. We did it. You goofed up. It was a teamwork. Okay, cheers to teamwork. Don't get smart. What did you want to talk about? You're a good Bhangra dancer. Tell me something I don't know. Well, you don't have a boyfriend. -How do you know that? -Figured it out seeing your expression. Kaptaan used to say, only a person in love can dance Jhumar well. I think you should leave. Don't ruin my buzz. Has anyone told you that your woofers are terrible? There's no one like Simi. Kaptaan also used to say, a good dancer must have an attitude, not an ego. Okay! ♪The air is intoxicating♪ ♪And I am drunk in your love♪ ♪The air is intoxicating♪ ♪I am drunk in your love♪ ♪I am a Punjabi boy♪ ♪And you're a princess♪ ♪Baby, come and dance with me all night♪ ♪Just go with the flow♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ ♪Show me what you got♪ ♪Don't be shy oh, girl♪ ♪Show me your steps oh, girl♪ ♪Let's get high on dance oh, girl♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ ♪Show me what you got♪ ♪Don't be shy oh, girl♪ ♪Show me your steps oh, girl♪ ♪Let's get high on dance oh, girl♪ ♪My lover is true to me♪ ♪I see God in my beloved♪ ♪My lover is true to me♪ ♪I see God in my beloved♪ ♪The thread that binds us together♪ ♪Can't be broken♪ ♪My love♪ ♪My lover is true to me♪ ♪I see God in my beloved♪ ♪Have a drink oh, girl♪ Excuse me... Oh! Go easy, man, you gotta dance later. Bro... Sat Sri Akaal. By the way, you're good at Bhangra too. Tell me something I don't know. What's this now? Ego or attitude? And yes, you don't have a girlfriend either. Figured from your expressions in Jhumar. Kaptaan says, only a person in love can do the Jhumar well... Only a person in love can do the Jhumar well. Well done. Who is this wise man, Kaptaan? Kaptaan! Kaptaan! Oh no, Father is here. You go to the field. Deepa, hide the drum. Let's start. -Hundred and twenty. -Twenty. Father will kill me. Idiots! Start from the same number. Come on. Forty one. Forty two. Forty three. Forty four. It warms my heart to see you working this hard. When my son goes into battle, the enemy will tremble in fear. Let him get recruited first, Uncle. Keep quiet. He is Jarnail Singh's grandson and Karnail Singh's son after all. Not a silly dancer like you. He's joining the army the day after. Wait and watch, my boy will win a bravery medal some day. Hurry up. A... C... A, B, C. Thank you so much. We have more alcohol. Yay! Let's go. Kaptaan, try some. Come on. Try it. Go on. Good job. I am Jarnail Singh's grandson, and Karnail Singh's son, Kaptaan Singh... going back home without getting recruited. How can I face my father? You are Kaptaan? The best Bhangra dancer in Malwa. Everyone knows this, except my father. Do you know I get invited to dance at weddings so that they become more joyous? It's a God given gift... But my father wants me to pick up a gun instead of a drum. Don't worry. Why don't you show us some Bhangra steps? Forget it, brother. Sing something at least. Kaptaan... I'll go and check. This is Bhangra, sir. The pride of Punjab and Punjabis. Yes, sir. When people perform Bhangra, there is a different energy in the air. Brings your blood to a boil. Sir, a rejected cadet. He can't even lift a gun. Father! Father, your son got selected. Of course. -When is the battle? -In ten days. Oh, come on. Don't worry, Mother. Don't cry. You've given birth to a brave son. I'll be back in a couple of days, Father. I'm going to Shinde's wedding. -Wait. -Yes? Do 800 push-ups before you go. Sure. ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪I get lost in your eyes♪ ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪My heart welcomes you♪ ♪My dear friend♪ ♪I want to cross the river To reach my beloved♪ ♪I want to cross the river To reach my beloved♪ ♪I have fallen in love♪ ♪With his beautiful face♪ ♪With his beautiful face♪ ♪I don't want to cross the river♪ ♪With a fragile boat♪ ♪I don't want to cross the river♪ ♪And die an early death♪ ♪These are old tales♪ ♪These are old tales♪ ♪Don't pay heed to them♪ ♪Romeo is no more♪ ♪Nor is Juliet Let's forget about their stories♪ ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪I get lost in your eyes♪ ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪My heart welcomes you♪ ♪These love stories never get old♪ ♪Even if the world changes♪ ♪Love lasts for an eternity♪ ♪I'd rather not lose my peace♪ ♪You fool Nothing is more beautiful than love♪ ♪I don't want to cry for love♪ ♪These are old tales♪ ♪These are old tales♪ ♪Don't pay heed to them♪ ♪Romeo is no more♪ ♪Nor is Juliet Let's forget about their stories♪ ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪I get lost in your eyes♪ ♪O my beloved♪ ♪My heart welcomes you♪ ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪I get lost in your eyes♪ ♪O, my beloved♪ ♪My heart welcomes you♪ Enough, guys, we need to proceed with the wedding rituals. You know, you'd be tired singing but I still wouldn't stop dancing. If you're so confident, then meet me by the pond tomorrow morning. Let's see who tires first, you or me. You are our guests for the next two days anyway. And we have to look after you all! Challenge accepted. Is this how you treat guests? I haven't found a twig to brush. You need a neem twig for that, not banyan. Should we start? You're in a hurry. Let me brush first. I can't stay for long. I have to cook for all of you at the temple. -Why are you covering your face? -Why should I show you my face? I am not mad. I'm engaged to someone. If someone sees me with you, my family will kill me. Oh. I wouldn't want that.

So, Kaptaan fell in love with Nimmo at first sight? -Yes. -And then he danced the Jhumar in love. I finally get it. But who is this Kaptaan? Kaptaan was my grandfather. Show some respect. How can you call him like that? Kaptaan was my best friend and a legend. Not a fictional character... "Show respect." -Simi! -What? Hope you remember we've come for Binny's wedding. Come. I haven't finished the story yet. That guy is a rock star. Got his number? Wait and watch, he'll ask for mine. Got her number? Pappi, chill. -She's impressed. She'll ask. -Awesome. Here. One second. I saw the video, Jaggi. She dances well. Get her on board. I'll speak with the Principal and start preparing. You're all set. You too. What? Pack the stuff and leave. Let me go and charm her. Madam, smile. Oh, finally you got time to be with me? You had promised me that you'll be with me during all the wedding rituals. I met this really cool guy. From Billu's family? Keep walking, ma'am. The DJ guy. Golu? Ma'am, look here. No. The DJ at the wedding next door. DJ Jaggi. Madam was floored by his music. By his dance, actually. Please walk a little faster. Shut up. Sat Sri Akaal. Billu, don't you worry, I'll take care of it. Look, let me clear this up. Don't act too smart or you'll get slapped. Hello! I have some self-respect. Don't you use alcohol as an excuse to get touchy with me. Chill, there's no danger to your honor. Tell me something... When did you realize that you're good at Bhangra? I've been hearing Kaptaan's stories since childhood. My father says, others have to learn, but Bhangra is in our blood. Father teaches Bhangra at Pendu Club. See this. I've learnt Bhangra from him for years. One day, I had to leave it all and come to Amritsar. Why? I had bigger dreams. And may I ask what are they? Mom says, if you share your dreams they won't come true. Your turn... When did you realize you're such a talented dancer? I didn't, my mother did. She saw my love for it. Whatever I couldn't say, I expressed through my dance. And then I trained harder and harder and became the best Bhangra dancer. Best "female" Bhangra dancer! Okay, I have to go. Time to earn some money. Your number in exchange for the shoes. -Five... -Eight, nine, zero. Eight, nine, zero. Tell me your full name. I know a lot of Simis. Simi Geeta Kohli. Geeta? Don't you use father's name? Forget it. My history is very boring. Tell me more about you. Friends, I have fallen in love. Really? We should celebrate then. Get some more booze. My friend is in love. Oh, come on. You better get married before you leave for the war. My thoughts as well. But I'm not sure if her family will agree. What are you saying, brother? If they don't, we'll get her to elope with you. It's my promise. Try me. You guys are my true friends. So, what's her name? Nimmo. Nimmo? Yes, that's her. The girl whose brothers are wrestlers? Yes, that's the one. Great. I'll take your leave. I have to tend to the fields early in the morning. Kaptaan, I need to leave as well. Where are you going? Have to take a piss. -I drank too much. -I need to go as well. What about your promise? Let go. Sat Sri Akaal. Sat Sri Akaal. Sat Sri Akaal. Sat Sri Akaal. Did I miss anyone? Sat Sri Akaal. What brings you here? My name is Kaptaan Singh. I live in the neighborhood. I didn't ask who you were. Why are you here? I am a soldier. I mean, what work do you have with us? Your sister, Nimmo... She sang so well at our friend Shinde's wedding. And you have come all the way here to say this? No. Actually, what I want to say is... The words are stuck. I can't seem to say them. Shall I pull them out for you? Brother, I am in love with your sister, Nimmo, and I want to marry her. You... No! No one will lay a hand on him. You! Choose, at whose hands you wish to die. Choose a weapon as well. I don't want people to say that we killed a lone, unarmed man. Look, I don't know how to fight. I just know how to dance. So, I will show you what I know. Deepa, play the drum. All that exercise has made your muscles bigger but your brains smaller. You boys can't recognize a good man. -What do you mean, Grandma? -Come here, I'll tell you. I think this boy is perfect for Nimmo. No one will keep her as happy as he will. His innocence reflects in his sincerity. What do you see in him, Grandma? I have seen what I had to. Poor Nimmo is yet to see the man you've chosen for her. Listen to me, he's a good boy. But he's a soldier who will be leaving for war soon. How can we get Nimmo married to him? Son, we will wait till Diwali. If you're back by then, you can marry Nimmo. If not, Nimmo will get married to the same guy she's engaged to. Thank you, Grandma. Bless you. Come on, it's time. Let's go. Sat Sri Akaal. Let's go. Time to go. Come on. -Take care of yourself. -You too. God bless you. Whenever you miss me, sing a song under the tree where we met. I'll dance on the battlefield for you. ♪Our lives are tied together♪ ♪By a single thread♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪Our lives are tied together♪ ♪By a single thread♪ Take care of her. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Simi, Uncle Timmy is leaving. He can give us a ride. Should we leave? I've eaten too much. Let's go. But I'm hungry. You haven't eaten yet? Let me take you for a treat. -Okay, let's go. -Hey... -You're breaking the protocol. -Sorry. Simi, are you sure you want to go with him? Anything for the competition? Hush! I haven't told him yet. Keep your phone on. I'll update you every 30 minutes. -Are you done talking? -Yes, let's go. Simi, you're a great dancer. That step of yours was awesome. Which one? The one in which you touch your hand and... This one. This one. It goes like this. -Should I give you a beat? -Sure. How'd you do it? Yes, like that. Correct. Can I tell you something? Sure. I want us to team up for this year's inter-college dance competition. Really? That's great! I want us to be on the same team too. Is it? On that note, victory to... -Khalsa College! -G.N.D.U. College! I think we drank too much. I heard the name wrong. Me too. Let's say it again. Victory to... -Khalsa College! -G.N.D.U. College! -You're from G.N.D.U. College? -You're from Khalsa? Victory to Khalsa College! No way! You're our biggest rival. And Mr. Jaggi, don't you dare copy any of my steps. Get lost! Don't you copy my steps! Which one? -Which step have I copied? -This one! This calls for war. The step you just learnt, better forget it right now. -Shall I give you a beat? -Shall I beat you up? Simi, there's no point fighting. I've spoken to the coach. You'll easily get admission. Join the winning team. You know, the winning team gets a fully sponsored trip to London, right? And that'll be our team. Now, get lost. Let me warn you. No one can ruin my dream of winning. Your mother is right, Jaggi. You shouldn't share your dreams or they won't come true. Geets, I saw this boy at the wedding yesterday. Going to weddings to see boys now, are we? Let me finish at least. You know how good he was at Bhangra? Give it. Was he better than you? No, no, he wasn't. No one can be better than you. No one should be better than you. Do you remember, Simu? How would you? You were only nine when your father left us. You have to get to London. Not illegally like him, but with your head held high. He'll see that you've gone there, not sneakily... But as a star. Geets, don't get so emotional. Forget Punjab, your daughter is the best Bhangra dancer in the world! Want some biscuits? Acting all emotional and sweet, huh? No, let it be. I have to get ready for college. Mom, don't you worry. I'm going to win this year. Sat Sri Akaal. Welcome to all. We are at LPU! Everyone is ready for the inter-college competition. You can see the excitement in the air. There are eight colleges participating this year. And like every year, there are two top favorites. Khalsa College and G.N.D.U. College, Amritsar. Both of them have strong teams. But the judges will decide the winner. And the winning team will be sent to London to participate in the Bhangra Battle International Competition. Sorry, Sir. Our lives are in danger every time we agree to judge this competition. Don't worry, we've informed the police well in advance. Victory to Khalsa College! Victory to G.N.D.U. College! Victory to Khalsa College! ♪See this boy dancing around me♪ ♪Like a patrolling cop♪ ♪This boy is vying for my attention♪ ♪Like a patrolling cop♪ ♪Dance, my friend Let's clink our glasses♪ ♪Dance, my friend Let the drinks flow♪ ♪I hear the music playing loud It sounds great on my woofers♪ ♪Let's come together for a Tik Tok♪ ♪Hold each other tight In this glorious season, you and I ♪ ♪Dance, my friend Let's clink our glasses♪ ♪Dance, my friend Let the drinks flow♪ ♪I hear the music playing loud It sounds great on my woofers♪ -♪Let's come together for a Tik Tok♪ -Just like I had predicted, the two teams to reach the finals, after the eliminations are... -Khalsa College... -Yay! -And G.N.D.U. College, Amritsar! -Yay! Cool! Cool! Cool! Anything can happen in the finals tomorrow. These two teams will face each other on the same stage. This is the ultimate dance off. Yay! Victory to Khalsa College! Victory to G.N.D.U. College! Hi! How are you, Mrs. Khurana? Listen, at my wedding... did you have an affair with the DJ or the video guy? What do you mean? Check your WhatsApp. You couldn't sleep either? Worried? Because of me? I would be, if I didn't know the results. But I do. I know I'll win. And I know that I will beat you. You're a sweet girl, Simi. But you're in the wrong team. You're a cute guy too. But you're my opponent. Why did you have to come to the wrong wedding? Even so, why did you follow me? Even if I followed you, why did you get egoistic? If a stranger was being egoistic, you should've left. Why did you start dancing? When I was leaving after the dance, why did you follow me? There's no end to this blame game, Jaggi. Okay, let's end it here. Whoever wins tomorrow, treats the other person with drinks. Okay, done. At the same joint where we parted ways. By the way, does your lead dancer know Kaptaan's story? It's not a story I share with everybody, Simi. Why me, then? Don't know. I just did. So, are you in love with this lead dancer of yours? Why? You need to be in love to perform the Jhumar well, right? Then both teams are equal when it comes to Jhumar. Victory to Khalsa College! Victory to G.N.D.U. College!

This is cheating. They must have bribed the judges! What nonsense! You guys are losers. What did you say? Our steps were fine. Our timing was also spot on. How the hell did we lose? They must've bribed the judges. You guys just zip it. I'm in jail at this age because of you fools! It was their lucky day. Tomorrow, it'll be ours. Enough, Geets. How many more? You've covered all angles. Come on! This is for you. What is the need of this? Why are you wasting money? Come on, let's take a selfie. Quick! Hold it like this. One more. Show me. I'll post all these photos on Facebook. Everyone will see. You've made all my dreams come true. She's going to England. -With her head held high-- -...to the Bhangra Competition. You're mocking me again? Forget it. The one you're trying to prove all this to, isn't a part of our lives. Let's not talk about him today. -Come, let's drink some wine. -Oh, God! Alcohol? -Not at all. It's just some fruit juice. -I don't want to. You go ahead and celebrate with your friends. -Sure? -Yes, go and party. Love you. Kiran: You're coming, right? Simi: No, meeting Jaggi. We're letting you off with a warning. Go home directly. Let's forget what happened, Coach. -We'll start afresh tomorrow. -The competition is over, Jaggi. They are going to London. So can we, Lakha. Jaggi, the winning team gets a sponsored trip to London. The losing team has to sponsor themselves. We'll raise the funds. Our team is better than theirs. And I am the best. We simply lost by a couple of points. Chotu! -Get some vodka. -Something to eat? We'll drink first. We'll eat later. Simi: I've ordered the drinks, hurry up. Simi: I've ordered the drinks, hurry up. Before I finish the bottle myself. Jaggi, don't count me in your team. I have to study for my exams. Even I have to apply for the sports quota. If I don't get a job after college, my dad will kill me. You guys are such losers. -Coach-- -Who are you calling losers, Jaggi? If you cared about teamwork, then you wouldn't be blaming us. Coach, we won't accept defeat. Leave them, let's form a new team. It wasn't the team's fault. Anyway, it won't be easy to come up with the money. Forget about London and focus on your studies. Let's go. Jaggi, if you weren't so distracted by Simi, we'd be packing for London now. Preety, we would've definitely won if your legs were faster than your tongue. She's calling you, Jaggi. She must be waiting for you. So, you won't go, huh? Why should I go there? Tell me. Why? To celebrate her success? Or my failure? Pappi, you know how important this competition was for me. Father... Kaptaan... None of them have got their due. Nobody knows them. This competition was the only way I could show the world what Bhangra means to us... and to Kaptaan. I've given my entire life for this. How could I just lose? Dude, let's go to a doctor. I'm fine. Why are you going back? How will you face them? It's wedding season and we'll be busy. You'll forget this loss. I don't want to forget it. Jaggi! Come out! Who are you? -What's going on? -I'll handle it, sir. Come down. What's wrong with you, Simi? You couldn't accept the fact that I defeated you. I waited for you endlessly. You didn't even have the guts to take my calls. Never mind. Today, let me make you an offer. Join the winning team and I'll take you to London. Today was your day, Simi. And you won. But next time, I'll win. Wait and watch. I'll get to London and defeat you in front of the entire world. You're such a loser, Jaggi. The only way guys like you can reach UK is by being illegal immigrants. Not a star like Simi. Remember this day. Not just this once, I'll defeat you every single time! Sir! Kaptaan has a request. He wants us to send a letter and inform his family that he died in the war. He'd rather die here than return to Nimmo in this state. ♪These eyes♪ ♪Await your return♪ ♪Are you upset with me?♪ ♪Nothing seems the same♪ ♪What is this emptiness I feel?♪ ♪Come back home now♪ ♪Don't trouble me this way♪ ♪Our house is lonely♪ ♪Waiting for your return♪ ♪My heart calls out for you♪ ♪Lies empty, without you♪ ♪Without you♪ ♪I am teary eyed♪ ♪Because I miss you♪ ♪Our memories♪ ♪Come back♪ ♪to me♪ ♪I am teary eyed because I miss you♪ ♪You're in my thoughts♪ ♪And in what I say♪ ♪My days without you♪ ♪Are crossed out♪ ♪On the blank pages of my life♪ ♪Every moment♪ ♪Waiting for your return♪ ♪My heart calls out for you♪ ♪My heart calls out for you♪ ♪Lies empty, without you♪ ♪Without you♪ Someone's being generous. Here. What's wrong? Given up drinking? Not in the mood. Did you lose? So, there is someone who can defeat you. Son... You may not remember. As a child you'd leave for school but end up at the Pendu Club every day. Sometimes I felt that Kaptaan made this club more for you than me. But as your interest in Bhangra grew, you grew further away from me. What was so wrong in that? For how long would we keep dancing in this village? I wanted to show everyone what Bhangra meant to Kaptaan, to you, to me, to us. Everything was on track but that girl Simi came and ruined everything. She probably knows that you don't forget your loved ones to follow your dreams. Dad, I'm not here to listen to your lectures. What is it then? What do you want? Tell me. Fine. Actually, I don't have a team. And I alone... Do those guys still come to train at Pendu Club? Finally you've come to the point. Son, they have always been here. You're the one who left us. And now you're back because you need them. -That's not true. -Then what is? I was missing Mom as well. Is she looking at us? Raise your glass. Cheers! Wow! You guys have improved so much! With my city training and your desi moves, we'll rock London. We'll practice hard, raise the money and win the competition. Coach, we've heard that he lost. And why should we dance with him? He's the one who left us. What if he leaves us again for another city team? -Come on, Harpal. -We don't need him. We'll reach wherever we have to, by ourselves. Let's go. You guys are right. You don't need me. But I'm the one who needs you. Please just trust me this time. -Let's go. -Sorry, Coach. What happened, son? You don't just get someone's trust. You have to earn it. And you won't just get a team. You have to make it. Wait a minute! Where's Lucky? Lucky! Lucky, we need to talk. Call me Sir. Everyone calls me Sir. I've won the district level inter-school competition. Sit. Leave, guys. Go. Play. Sir, will you help me build a team? Look, there are quite a few issues with you. No team, no money. And you're a traitor above all. How will you solve this? I'll try my best to be a changed man. You just... I mean... Sir, please help me get the others on board. Fine. I'm sure I can make that happen. But what's in it for me? We've progressed a lot in the last two years. Harpal, for instance. He might be a farmer but has the attitude of a billionaire. Looks after his fields all by himself. There's only one way to win him over. Come with me. Now, Amrinder. She's as good a designer as she is a dancer. She will make fantastic costumes for us. Yes! And lastly, we have Heer. She's studying for IELTS for the past three years. She has only one desire. Going abroad. Shut up. I'll shut up if you join the team. Think about it. You can impress all those foreign guys with your English. I have one condition. What if you've forgotten desi Bhangra after living in the city? Let's see if you are good enough for our team or not. ♪My heart beats♪ ♪To the rhythm of the song♪ ♪Why do you stand there?♪ ♪Come and dance♪ ♪Listen carefully♪ ♪To what I say♪ ♪Why do you stand there?♪ ♪Come and dance♪ ♪Put your heart♪ ♪And soul into the dance♪ ♪Come Let's do the Bhangra!♪ ♪What a joke!♪ ♪Let's do the Bhangra!♪ ♪Let's do the Bhangra!♪ ♪Let's do the Bhangra!♪ -Have you heard of this Pendu Club? -Pendu Club? No. Sounds like a wannabe club. Jaggi has joined them. We can't take them lightly. Let them get to London first. The registration fee is in pounds. There are section rounds and other expenses too.

Okay. Son, I think it has blown a fuse. -Check. -Try some of this. Sure. Dad, it uses Wi-Fi, it's wireless. There's no fuse. -Make some place for the expert. -Come here. As you know, this year's Bhangra Battle is the biggest international dance competition. We've invited the most talented and promising teams from around the world. These teams have been selected from four zones. Like every year, we have a few teams who didn't get sponsored. But based on their talent they will be selected for the last two remaining spots. And will get a chance to compete. They have no chance of winning. I'll get you some fruit juice. Jaggi, I've packed some sweets. All set? Don't eat it up all alone. So, Mr. Kesar Singh... Aren't you upset that I'm leaving the village again? Not this time. You're no longer the same Jaggi. Is this the coach or my dad speaking? We did it! London! You can go back home. He has written an application for you. I don't want to go back. Your family must be waiting for you, Kaptaan. I told you, I don't want to return! Everybody is expecting the old Kaptaan. The Kaptaan who sings, dances... and brings joy to all with his Bhangra. Not this Kaptaan... who can't even walk without help. I won't go back home. I won't. I will die here. I can't go back. I can't. Jaggi, look! Chocolates! How are you, Simi? I told you I'd get here. Pendu Club? Sounds very desi. Bhangra is a desi dance form. It was spread across cities later. You seem to know a lot. You might've reached here, but I won't let you win. Make sure you take a few selfies in London to post on your Instagram when you lose and return. The more you provoke me, the better I'll perform. How did they afford to come to London? Bunch of villagers. Bhangra originated in the villages, Veer. It came to the cities much later. ♪Our eyes met♪ ♪And my heart started beating faster♪ ♪Why do you stay away from me?♪ ♪Come and dance with me♪ ♪Come, guys ♪ ♪Let's dance with all we've got♪ ♪The way you move♪ ♪You're like a graceful peacock♪ ♪Why do you stay away from me?♪ ♪Come and dance with me♪ ♪Come with me♪ ♪And enjoy the colors of the world♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ ♪Let's dance with all we've got♪ ♪And come on to the dance floor♪ ♪Come, guys♪ ♪I will leave everything for you♪ ♪If you ask me to♪ ♪Leave all your tantrums behind♪ ♪And come and dance with me♪ ♪Forget about the world♪ ♪And become mine♪ ♪We will dance together♪ ♪Every day, every month, every year♪ ♪Dance with me, darling♪ ♪Let's look into each other's eyes♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ ♪Let's dance with all we've got ♪ ♪Let's dance with all we've got ♪ ♪And come on to the dance floor♪ ♪Our eyes met♪ ♪And my heart started beating faster♪ ♪Why do you stay away from me?♪ ♪Come and dance with me♪ ♪The way you move♪ ♪You're like a graceful peacock♪ ♪Why do you stay away from me?♪ ♪Come and dance with me♪ ♪Come with me♪ ♪And enjoy the colors of the world♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ ♪And come on to the dance floor♪ ♪Let's color our lives♪ Guys! Guys! Guys! Get off! Let's go. Hurry. Hurry up, guys. Get an ice pack. -Are you okay, Jaggi? -I'm fine. Simi! Tara. I want to grow up to be just like you. I like to dance as well. That's what my mother did. I saw that you've qualified for the finals. How is Geeta? She is well. I know you're angry with me. -Just give me a chance to explain-- -Please. I was around Tara's age when you left, right? Try not to leave this family of yours. My mother is a strong woman. Your absence didn't make a difference to our lives. Simi... What have you done? Tell me. Nothing. I just love you. I'm hanging up now. Bye. Your history isn't so boring after all. Vodka? Let's go! How long has it been? Since childhood. -How did you form the team? -Hard work. Why didn't you confront him? I thought the day I'd see him I'd say a lot. But I didn't have the heart to, when I saw Tara. Why fight with someone you don't want to keep a relationship with? What did the doctor say? Can you dance tomorrow? Or am I winning again? If you're pulling my leg, pull the right one, left one still hurts. But you're really lucky, Simi. You had all the chances of losing. Kaptaan's grandson is saying this? What would he have done in your place? I've won the medal, Father. But I lost the love of my life. Kaptaan, you are back? We thought you were dead. Looks as good as dead to me. Why are you here? Look around. Nimmo is getting married today. I've come to ask for Nimmo's hand in marriage to Kaptaan. He will keep her very happy. How dare they come for Nimmo on her wedding day! You've come here but what can you do now? You cannot fight. And now you can't even say that you can dance. Leave. ♪My beloved is shining♪ ♪With love's pure light♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪Our lives are tied together♪ ♪By a single thread♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪By a single thread♪ ♪Bound together forever♪ ♪Bound together forever♪ Stop! Kaptaan cannot fight, but I can. Nobody will touch him. I'll apologize to the groom's family. Nimmo cannot marry their son. She loves Kaptaan. His love for her is evident in the way he danced. I have decided that Nimmo can't marry anyone else. She belongs to Kaptaan. ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪In my beloved I see the eternal lover♪ ♪In my soul I see him♪ ♪Our lives are tied together♪ ♪Bound together forever♪ ♪Bound together forever♪ What do you think, Jaggi? Kaptaan narrated these stories to make you fall in love with Bhangra? He told his grandson the story of his life. You heard his story. But you didn't learn anything. Bhangra was his passion. But only Nimmo was his one true love. You okay, Jaggi? What did the doctor say? ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪We are meant To be together♪ ♪Let's dance tonight♪ ♪And you'll see I'm the one for you♪ ♪I wanna dance with you♪ ♪All I wanna do is dance♪ ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪We are meant To be together♪ ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪Leave all your worries behind♪ ♪And hit the dance floor♪ ♪Let's dance the night away♪ ♪And leave the world behind♪ ♪Don't be shy, girl, come to me♪ ♪Let's do the Bhangra together♪ ♪Move your body with mine♪ ♪I'll show you how♪ ♪You know, I get what you say Don't take me lightly♪ ♪I just wanna dance with you I don't care♪ ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪Tonight is the night♪ ♪For our hearts to meet♪ ♪If you give me permission I'll get close to you♪ ♪You know, I get what you say Don't take me lightly♪ ♪I just wanna dance with you I don't care♪ ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪We are meant To be together♪ ♪Let's dance tonight♪ ♪And you'll see I'm the one for you♪ ♪I wanna dance with you♪ ♪All I wanna do is dance♪ ♪Listen to me, baby♪ ♪We are meant To be together♪ ♪With the strength of your love♪ ♪You will win over the world♪ ♪With the strength of your love♪ ♪You will win over the world♪ ♪I am your refuge♪ ♪And the shore that you seek♪ ♪You are my guiding star♪ ♪You are my happiness♪ ♪There is light in my life♪ ♪As my dreams shine bright♪ ♪There is light in my life♪ ♪As my dreams shine bright♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪You have taught me♪ ♪There is nothing greater than love♪ ♪The greatest victor is♪ ♪The one who can win hearts♪ ♪Adorned♪ ♪The world has been adorned♪ ♪Finally♪ ♪I have found out the essence of life♪ ♪There is light in my life♪ ♪As my dreams shine bright♪ ♪There is light in my life♪ ♪As my dreams shine bright♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪Come love, let's dance the night away♪ ♪Dance♪ ♪With love's pure light♪ ♪My beloved is here♪ Both of us have won one round each.
