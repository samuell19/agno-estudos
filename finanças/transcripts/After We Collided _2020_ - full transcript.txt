The entire world is a collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her. Whatever our souls are made of, hers and mine are the same. A rather pretentious way to open our story... but I've always had a flair for the dramatic. You see, this is our story... Tessa's and mine. It's a story you've heard before, passed down from the Greeks, through Shakespeare, the Brontes, Jane Austen. It's the story of a young girl exploring her independence, free from the bonds of her oppressive parent... and promised to a boy she clearly does not love. She meets a dashingly handsome young man who sweeps her off her feet... even though he represents everything she detests. She falls for him, gives herself to him, and is ultimately betrayed by him and left shattered. Only it is he who is destroyed by his deceit. When it feels as though all is lost, the two reunite and live happily ever after. Like I've said, a story you've heard before. Only difference is... this isn't that story. Hey. Can I ask you a question? - Piss off. - I'm looking for someone. Piss off! Whoo! Sure don't seem like Christmas out here, all this heat we've been havin'. Ya know, I hate the heat. Heat make people do some crazy things. Hoo! Thank... Thank you! Sorry. Excuse me! Sir, can you hold that elevator, please! Asswipe! Thank you. Did you call me an asswipe? Excuse me? You just called me an asswipe. Um, no. I didn't. Yeah, I guess I just imagined it. Guess so. Ya know, I was trying to hold the elevator for you. Sure you were. Look, I'm sorry. It's my first day. I'm just trying to make an impression. Well, you certainly succeeded at that. Asswipe. No, no, no, no... - You work here? - Surprise. Tessa! Welcome to Vance Publishing. Hi. Kimberly, right? Excellent memory. I'm impressed. Yes, she makes quite the impression. You two know each other? Uh... we're old friends. Now, if you ladies will excuse me? - Are you excited to get going? - Yeah. Let's introduce you to the boss. Shut the fuck up and listen to me! This might not be the best time for introductions. Why don't I show you your office? Trevor! On it. I apologize for the mess. We've been short on interns lately, and we're a bit backlogged. That seems crazy to me. People I know would kill for an internship here. I know, it's just that Vance has this small problem with firing them after a day. But that's not going to happen to you. I have a good feeling about this. But like I said during the interview, your job is to read five manuscripts a week, and if you like them, just forward them on to me. - Okay. - The kitchen is right down the hall. Feel free to place any order for lunch. - Any questions? - Uh, no. I'm good. You got this. Mmm. Mr. Vance! Um... Um, I'm so sorry. I must have dozed off. - What time is it? - 9:25. 9:25? - Am I fired? - Sit down. You mean to tell me you read three books and did coverage on all of them last night, and you think Carnival of Light by Niko Tanaka is a great read? Yeah, it is. It's, uh, she has a really original voice, it's a lot like an early Margaret Atwood, The Edible Woman, - Surfacing... - I'm coming down now. Grab your things. Come with me. Oh, shit. Morning, Mr. Vance. - Morning, sir. - Mr. Vance, I was just... I was wondering if we had time to go back to... Get in. Because I have to get my phone charger in at... Oh, we're closing the door! Little work tip. - Hmm? - It helps if you don't wear the same clothes every day. That, and showering. Um, where are we going? There's a digital publishing conference, and I need to secure some funding for my expansion. Fuck off! What part of "We're closed" don't... - Hi. - You busy? Kind of in the middle of something. So, you know, why don't you come back tomorrow? Or just come in right now. I'm good. Come on, it'll ease the pain. I like the pain. Well, suit yourself, you fuckin' masochist. Welcome back the Montgomery, Mr. Vance. I have your rooms ready for you. We had a printer delivered to Mr. Trevor Matthews' room. Unfortunately, Ms. Young's room wasn't ready, so we had her upgraded to a suite with compliments of the management. Has Mr. Jiang checked in yet? I do believe he's at the bar. Of course he is. So I get a printer and you get a suite. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Definitely. Hon', do you mind taking Tessa shopping? She needs something for tonight. I trust you. Let's go have some fun. Are you sure that I can get in? Because I've never been to a nightclub before. But don't they check...? You'll be with us. It won't be a problem. Look, before we go outside, I just wanted to tell you something. Okay. Vance and I are... more than co-workers. Oh. It was strictly a work thing for years, especially after his wife died, then I started helping out with his son Smith, and, well, love can really take you by surprise. Yes, it can. - That's him? - Mm-hmm. - Aw. - He's the sweetest kid. Ohh. Can't wait for them to see you in this dress tonight. Oh, shoot. We forgot to buy you underwear. But my clothes are at the laundry. If I leave now, I can run back to the mall... Oh, no, no, no. No. It's fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay, I guess we're goin' commando, then. I can't believe I've been at Vance for only a day. Well, Hardin said we'd be lucky to have you. - You spoke to Hardin. - No, Vance did. He didn't tell you? Must have slipped his mind. Yes, well, as long as we're at the conference by two... Wow. You clean up nicely. Gee, Trevor, you sure know how to charm the ladies. Tessa, you look stunning. Thank you. On the move. So what books have you written? Oh, this and that. Feel like I'm sitting at the kids' table. Thanks. No, that's not what I meant. Sorry. I hate nightclubs. Probably because I suck at dancing. I love Ohio football, but I hate nightclubs. Why are we here? Him. Mr. Jiang. His family owns a hedge fund worth 800 million and it's considering investing in Vance's expansion. You want me to get you a drink? I'm gonna stick with water. All my budget really allows these days. I thought you were a paid intern. You'd be surprised how much Uber charges can add up. I mean, I'd be lucky to break even. - I'll go. - What it is? Sex on the Beach. Quite a beach. Grab a straw. On your mark, get set, go. It's really good. Mr. Jiang, have you had a chance to look at my numbers yet? With the forecast of rising interest rates... Again. Just... Yeah. We're gonna get fucked up tonight! Well, well, look what the cat dragged in. That's a stupid fucking expression. Why would a cat drag me anywhere? Welcome back, bro. Did you miss us? Wait. I don't get it. Of course you don't. This is great! I feel like dancing! Guess who. Okay, I'll give you a hint. She's super fuckin' hot, a lot of fun, and loves to fuck. - Mother Teresa. - No. Ew. Ta-da! I know, I look amazing. I've had, like, no carbs in eight weeks, - but I'm feeling fucking fantastic. - Wow. Yeah, its from the lack of carbs and not all the blow. Don't you have some carpets to munch on? Don't you have some dick to suck? What do I have to do to make you forgive me? - I know I've been really bad. - Worse than bad. Yeah, but you like it when I'm bad. You know you miss me. Now get the fuck off me. Whoa! What the fuck, Hardin?! Hardin, you didn't mind fucking me before, though, right? Oh, let me guess. You're still moping over that stuck-up bitch. Don't fuckin' talk about her, okay?! Look at you. You look like a lost little puppy over some Virgin Mary-turned-skank who doesn't even want you! Ohhh, God. What the fuck you looking at, freshman? You want me to steal your boyfriend? So turn the fuck around. I look hot. Tessa? Hi! I just, uh, I just wanted to inform you that I look hot, and you're missing it. Tessa, where are you? Whoo! Somewhere that you're not. Tess, I have your location, I can find you. How much have you had to drink? I don't know, like five? Five what? Uh, Sex on the Beaches. Or is it Sexes on the Beaches? That coulda been fun! You are wasted. Oh, hey, Hardin? I'm the commander. I've been the commander all night. Command... What's it called? I'm not wearing any underwear! - Aaah! Ha ha ha! - Tess, who are you with? Why haven't you called me? I've texted you a hundred times! You haven't replied! I actually have to go, but it was nice talking to you, Mr. Hardin Scott, so goodbye. Don't fu... Te... Tessa. Trevor! I'm drunk, uncomfortable, and I saw a tampon on the ground. - I'm leaving. - Yeah, no, me too. Can we order room service? I... I want French fries and... ice cream. Dow! Nothin' like a vanilla sundae at three in the morning. Yeah, it sounded better in the moment. - So... Tessa. - Hmm. - Tessa Young. - Mm-hmm. Why the hell are you in publishing? Well, I love to read... That makes sense. What's your favorite book? It's The Principles of Economics by Alfred Marshall. - No, it's not. - Yeah, it is. No, I mean... I mean, like, fiction. Like... Like a real book. I don't do fiction. I mean, have you seen how I dress? - You heathen! - Heathen? You heathen! Fiction's an escape from reality, it's a way that, like, you can live a hundred lives, or even a thousand. I don't need to live a thousand lives. Okay? And I would rather watch paint dry. I, um, that wasn't... No, I... that wasn't supposed to happen. Look, I'm telling you, I know what I'm doing. We just have to soak it before it stains. Can I have your pants? - Tessa... - Gimme your pants! Otherwise it's gonna stain. Tessa! - Tessa, open the door. - Is that Hardin Scott? Open the door! Hi. Are you trying to get me kicked out of this place? Yeah, come on in, why don't you? Hey... Hey, Hardin, didn't see ya. How ya been? - Fucking Trevor?! - Time to go, I think. - I'm just gonna... - No, you're not. - I just wanna talk to him! - No! No... - Tessa... Tessa... - Stop! - Hardin, I think this is a mis... - Fuck off. You're such a dick. Why are you even here? I'm a dick? I'm not the one taking advantage of drunk girls. You... You do know that not every guy is trying to get in my pants, right? - You'd be surprised. - You can't tell me who I can and can't have sex with, because it's none of your business anymore! - Were you going to have sex with him? - Oh, my God! - What? - You're insane! You're avoiding the question. What if I was? What? You heard me. What if I was? What, you don't like that? You don't like the idea of Trevor's hands... all over my body? Touching me? I've missed this. - Tessa, you're drunk. - Mm-hmm. So? Tess... Hmm! You don't want this? Of course I want this, but I... Hardin... you have two options here. Either you fuck me, or you leave. You decide. Ohh. - Do you have a condom? - Are you sure? - Why not. - You'll hate me tomorrow. Yeah, well, I hate you already. Tell me I'm the only one. You're the only one. Mmm. - Hi! - Morning! - Kimberly! - You up? Yeah... no, yeah, I've been up for a while. - See you down in five. - Five minutes? - Problem? - Nope, not a problem. - Meet you in the lobby. - Okay, I'll be right down. - Don't be late. - Okay. Bye. Shit! Where are my clothes?! Ohh! Tessa! Come back to bed. Tessa! What?! What do you want?! The other Tessa. The one who's nice? Yeah, well, she's late for work. - Where are my... - Why are you so... Hey! Privacy! Privacy. After what we did last night, you want privacy? Don't remind me. Hey, you called me. I didn't tell you to come here. Okay, I'm starting to get the feeling you're not entirely cool with what happened last night. No, I'm not cool with it. Well, do you want to talk about it? Nope. You hurt me and I can't forgive you. - That's it. - So last night meant nothing. I was drunk. I called you, you came here... I made a mistake. But you obviously missed me. I didn't know what I was doing. - From kissing that guy, to... - What? - What? - From kissing? - What did you say? - I didn't say anything. - You said "kissing that guy." - No. - What?! T... - I need to go. Tessa, wait. Tessa! Tessa! Put your clothes on! - Who did you kiss? - No one! - Was it Trevor? - No! My Tessa would never kiss a fuckin' stranger at a club. There is no "your Tessa" anymore! Yeah, well, when you were kissing that guy, I was fucking Molly. Fuck you! Fuck! - Oh! - Sorry. Hi. - Hi. - Got us some lattes. Thank you. Oh. Thank you. So, interesting night. Trevor, I'm... so sorry about last night. No, don't be. If I showed up to my girlfriend's hotel room and I saw a half-naked, incredibly handsome man there, I'd react the same way. Is he still lurking around? Should I be hiding in the van? He's the one that should be hiding, and we are not together. How do you two know each other? - Hardin worked at Vance last year. - He did? Yeah. Same position as you, actually. Kind of a sad story. We were best of friends, and... then we became lovers, and then I found a red hair on my pillow. Hilarious. Ya know, I didn't peg you as the bad boy type. We'll save that for another time. My hero. Ohh. Anyone else feel like death? I don't know what you two said or did to Neil last night, but he just wrote a humongous check to finance our expansion. Good job. What are you doing here? I need some advice. Advice? You want advice from me? Yeah. I'm that desperate. Oh, insults. Great. I thought you were an imposter for a second. - Look, bro, I know I- - No, step-bro. I'm not your brother. You made that very clear. And if I was Tessa, I'd never speak to you again, Hardin. - It's unforgiveable. - You think I don't know that?! I know I fucked up! I know! She won't return my calls or texts. I found out she kissed some guy. And... And I told her I fucked Molly. - You slept with Molly? - No, I said I did. That's the point. I didn't. I said it to get back at her, and I-I realized how stupid that was. - Yeah. - Oh, fuck this! So you're just gonna run away like you do from everything. Right? - Where you goin'? - London. I was going to take her with me. I'll see you next year. Hardin, do you really love her? No bullshit. Yes. Of course I fucking love her. I've never felt this way about anyone before! Just wish I didn't fuck the whole thing up. Focus. Knock knock. - Hi. - Hi. You're probably goin' out of town for break, so just wanna say happy holidays, and a happy birthday. - It's your birthday, right? - Tomorrow. I made you something. What's... What's this? It is a cost analysis breakdown of your weekly Uber expenditure versus owning a used car. Okay... I know. It's just, turns out you're wasting a lot of money. I did a little research, and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla, in town, in excellent condition. I went down to the dealership, negotiated terms, and you'd put no money down, you only pay 150 bucks a month. Vance also agreed to put your auto insurance on company policy, so that's free. This is, of course, if you want to do it. I just like crunching numbers... Oh, my God! - I take it you... - Oh, my God! Mwah! Thank you. Bye, Tessa. So, what do you think? Well, you know, it's, uh... it's very Tessa. I will take that as a compliment. I'm right up there. How's Dakota? Um, I'm actually looking at your birthday horoscope. So first off, you share a birthday with... - Joseph Stalin. - Great. - You are a proud, idealistic person... - Like Stalin. You are more emotional than is obvious. You may solidify a romantic relationship or become involved with a mature partner. Mature. That doesn't really sound... No, it doesn't. He left for London. Have you heard from him? I haven't, because I blocked him. That'll work. Bye. Whose place is this? "You can draw me to fire, "you can draw me to water. "You can draw me to the gallows, you can draw me to any death." Well, here we are. I could run you a bath if you'd like to get more comfortable. I would love that. I remember when you and I used to take baths together. Oh, my goodness! Tessa? - Tessa. - Hardin's mother. Hardin said you were gonna be out of town, I didn't think I was gonna meet you! - Yeah. - My God, I cannot believe how pretty you are. I mean, Hardin said you were the most beautiful girl in the world, but honestly, I thought you were gonna be covered in tattoos, green hair, and a piercing on your bean. - What bean? - Mum. Don't be so melodramatic, Hardin. You and I are gonna be the best of friends. Do you mind if I use the loo? Yeah, of course. It's just, um... Oh, look at you! - Why are you here? - I came to get the rest of my stuff. - You were supposed to be in London. - I know. I didn't want to go without you, so she came here. Why didn't you tell her that we broke up? She was so excited when I told her first, - I couldn't ruin it for her. - Hardin! She's my mum! I couldn't tell her about the stupid bet, okay? I'm sorry. I don't expect you to pretend we're still together. - It's fine. - What's fine? I said it's fine. I'll play along. Thank you, Tessa. Thank you so much. Thanks for the Kindle. Fuck! Happy birthday! - Is it your birthday? - Yeah, it is. Why are we not celebrating? 'Cause I... I was just about to head out of town. - No! - Yeah, I'm gonna see my mom. Can I be selfish and ask you to stay another night? Well, my mom's sort of expec... We don't know when we're gonna see each other again. Yeah. I, uh, I... I guess I can leave tomorrow. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. I am gonna whip you up a homemade birthday cake that is gonna blow your mind. Cool. Cool. I know I'm biased 'cause I'm his mum, but isn't that just the cutest little bum you've ever seen? Oh, my God, Mum, please. - Hush. - It's a pretty cute bum, Hardin. Right. Well, uh, you guys are obviously having lots of fun, so I'm just gonna clear up, and then... set myself on fire. So Hardin tells me you're an English major as well. Mm-hmm. I'm in the process of switching from econ. I actually just got an internship at Vance Publishing. Vance, as in... Christian Vance? Mm-hmm. Hardin and I stayed with Vance for a few years when Ken and I broke up. - Really? - Yeah. Hardin never mentioned that. Never mentioned what? Nothing, darling. Just girl talk. I'm just gonna grab a blanket and sleep on the floor. You don't think we could share the bed and not... - You know. - Do you? Well, I'd like to think that we're not total Neanderthals. Okay. G'night. Good night. Um... I'm gonna leave early in the morning to... to head out of town. Okay. Thank you for staying tonight. Thanks for having me. Sorry. No. No, it's... That's okay. That feels nice. - Does it? - Mm-hmm. - Did you have a nice birthday? - Yeah, I did. And thank you again for the... gift, it was really thoughtful. I found it when I was getting my stuff. I'm glad you like it. I love it. I got a car. - You got a car? - Mm-hmm. What car did you get? A white one. Well, happy birthday. Night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. - Hardin. - Huh? This isn't working. Why? What's wrong? Feel. Oh. You? Oh. Hardin, we should stop. Okay. Three seconds and we'll stop. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. - Three... - Three... - two... - two... - one. - one. - Okay, ten more seconds. - Okay. - And then we'll stop. - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Will you apologize to your mum for us kidnapping you last night? I will. I can't tell you how much it means to me to see Hardin this way. What way? Happy. What? - Bye. - Bye. Nice wheels! - Vroom vroom! - Noah, hi! - Hi! - It's good to see you! Good to see you too. Mmm. Okay... Your mom told me that you were comin' home today, so I figured I'd come greet you. Did she have you on speed dial the second I crossed the county line? I mean, can you blame her? She knows a good thing when she sees it. - Right. - Right. Um, how's senior year? You know me, breakin' hearts and takin' names. - That's you. - Yeah? Yeah. Your mom told me about the internship. - That's really awesome. - Thanks. Yeah. And everything's cool with the whole thing with your dad. - What whole thing with my dad? - What? N-Nothing. Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - I-I don't know. - I thought that she would have... - Thought she what? Uh... Are you kidding? - Why is she calling you? - I'm sorry, Tess. Sorry, I got stuck at work. - Is she there yet? - Mom? - Carol, she knows! - Knows what?! Oh! Tessa's with you. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. What is going on with Dad?! Okay, that was rude. I'm just asking you about Dad. Fine. Your father wanted to see you, but I chased him off. Why are you getting so worked up about this? I'm not getting worked up! I just don't understand why you'd keep that a secret. And you never kept any secrets from me? Because I can think of a big one, and so can Noah. I thought we got past this little hiccup once you got your heart broken. But I can tell by the sound of your voice that this not the case. This boy is not good for you, Teresa. - He is just like your father. - I'm hanging up. - No! Don't you fucking hang up on me! - This was a mistake. Theresa? Theresa? I blew it. I blew it, Carol. I don't know what happened. Mummy? No! Mummy? Hardin, get back upstairs now! Hey. Hey, I'm right here. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. It was just a nightmare. Morning. There... um, there's tea. I... Help yourself. Thanks. Is he okay? - Hmm? - The nightmares. I heard him last night. Um, he's sleeping now. How long have they been going on? Uh, ever since he was eight. Um, he, uh, well... He told me... about that night and what he saw. The assault. Whoa. He's never told anyone that before. I'm so sorry for what happened to you. I just hoped he'd forget the whole thing. But the nightmares kicked in. Sorry. And I took him to therapist after therapist, but nothing seemed to help. And then he started self-medicating with alcohol. But, um... ...he told me that the nightmares went away when he started seeing you. I didn't know that. May I ask... why does your mum hate him so much? Um, Hardin's your son... Yes, and I love him, but he is not without his challenges. You can tell me. What happened between you two? He lied to me. - A big lie? - A massive lie. Is he sorry? He is. What are you two gabbing on about? Make sure you brush your teeth. He used to give me such a hard time about brushing his teeth. Mum, for the love of God, of course I'm gonna brush my teeth. Great. Morning! Morning. Thank you. I love your mom. She's all right. Happy belated. But you already got me a gift. True, but you had to snoop around and open it without me, thus denying me the pleasure of watching you react to said gift. Therefore... "Tessa's perfect day." What's my perfect day? Well, that's for you to decide. Whatever your wish or desire, I will agree to without any snide remarks or tantrums. Your time starts in three, two, one. Isn't this nice? I always wanted to go ice skating. Yeah, it's... great. I'm loving... Unhh! Unh... - Are you okay? - Yeah. Just a tad rusty. When was the last time you skated? I've never skated before. Do you want me to get you a walker? You're doing great. Fuck no! Are you... Oh, it's okay. It's... it's okay. Whoo. - Are you okay? - Yup. Do you want to stop? No. We're here to have... Unhh! Aaah! Hardin? I have a better idea. Stretch out into Child's Pose, and let the day's tension just melt away. It's not the pose melting this tension away, - it's the fucking heat. - Shh! - Is there any air-conditioning? - It's hot yoga. From Child's Pose, lift, and slowly press back into your Downward Facing Dog. Did anyone ever tell you you have the most amazing bum? Stop. ...and slowly move into salamba sarvangasana. Excuse me, is this beginner's yoga? That was at ten-thirty. This is acro-yoga. ...and then lift them up and towards the ceiling. Breathe together. Inhale, lift your arms overhead. And as you exhale, lean forward. Allow your partner's weight to lean into you. Slowly breathe and open your legs and... wider... inhale... a little wider... and if you can, put your legs even wider. Is yoga supposed to be a turn-on? Are you turned on? Mm-hmm. - Can we leave then? - Mm-hmm. - Now? Let's go. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sweaty! I am sweaty! Wait! Just give me five minutes, okay? I just need to get... Oh, my God. Hardin. Let's get these off. Okay, we're getting somewhere! Oh, shit! It's my boss, I have to get this. Are you serious? Hi! Kimberly, what's wrong? Oh, no. How can we help? Hmm. Hi. You have no idea how much of a lifesaver the two of you are right now. God, poor Vance caught this bug and he's throwing up everywhere. It's no problem. Okay, who are you and what have you done with Hardin? It's part of my birthday present. I'll tell you later. Ohh! I'm running so late. I'll be back in a few hours, okay? You're in good hands. - Bye. - Thank you. Hi. Um, so, we have the whole afternoon together. - Is there anything that you want to do? - No. I could get us some markers and we can draw! I don't like to draw. No? Are you hungry? No. Wanna tell me about your trains? Okay, I don't want to hear about them anyway. What are those marks on your arm? My tattoos. - Why do you have them? - Because I like them. Don't people think it looks strange? I don't give a fuck what people think. Which people don't you give a fuck about? - Oh, shit. Don't say fuck. - Shit. Fuck. Shit. Fucky fuck. Shit... - Hey. So... - Hi! he is actually hungry now. We need to get him some... Fuck. Shit. Uh, I can go if you want. - Or you could. - No, it's fine. - I'll get us some sandwiches. - Perfect. - Thank you so much. - Whoo! Okay! - See you later. Bye-bye. - Okay, bye! Shit. Fuck. Shit. Go ahead. Here, I can take those now. You know, she really brings out the best in you. Is it that obvious? Have a nice holiday. You too. See ya, mate. See ya, mate. You ready? Yeah. Uh, we're the last ones here, so I just have to set the alarm. Merry Christmas. Christmas is next week. I've never been one to follow the rules. It says "Whatever our souls are made of..." "His and mine are the same." What's wrong? I didn't think that I'd see you over the holidays, so I didn't get you anything. Is there anything that you want? Another chance? Do you promise to act like this every day? No. But I'll try. Whatever it takes. We can't do this here. What if someone comes in? Helloooo? Anyone here? Anyone?! You just have an answer for everything, don't you? It's fake. Shit. There's no one else for me, Tessa. No one. I love you. I love you too. Don't say "too." Sounds like you're agreeing with me. I love you, Hardin. Trish. Yeah, it's Ken. This is a surprise. So listen, um, my wife Karen and I are having people over for Christmas, and... we would love it if you and Hardin and Tessa could join us. Well, I'm leaving for London today, but, um... the flight's not until this evening, so I think we can pop over. It would mean the world to me. I guess we'll see you later, then. Merry Christmas, Trish. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh! I'm so proud of you. Can't wait to meet her. This is his house? - I told you. - For fuck's sake, I didn't think it was this big. Mum, we don't have to do this. Look, the last time I saw your dad was ten years ago. It's time. Come on. - Hi. Karen? - Yes, hi. Thank you for having us. Well, come on. Merry Christmas. This humble one, right here now, he just co-authored a new interpretation of Taming of the Shrew with the head of the English department. It's not a big deal. It is a big deal! ...directed that to perfection. That third act had me in tears. We saw it twice. Uber's gonna be here - in five minutes. - Oh! Well, I'm glad you stopped by. Me too. Dinner should be ready shortly. Okay, I hope everybody has a hearty appetite. - Absolutely! - Karen is a dynamite cook. Yes, she is. Where'd you go? Just for a walk. So Trish, I hear that this is your first time in the States? - Yeah, it is. - And how do you like it? There's a lot to see. It's kind of worn out its welcome, if you ask me. Be happy to get back home once I graduate. You're moving back to England after graduation? Yeah, of course I am. Trish, can I get you another glass before you leave us? No. But it was lovely. Thank you. I'm so glad you like it. We got it in Greece on our honeymoon. I stuck to Pellegrino. We stayed in this gorgeous villa. Did you know that the beaches in Santorini are made up of volcanic pebbles, so there's no sand to make the water murky. So it is a crystal-clear... - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Hardin. - Excuse me? - Look at your fucking trousers. I'm sorry, Mum, but seriously, do you have any sensitivity whatsoever? You're just boorishly droning on with no regard for the lives you destroyed. P-Perhaps we could find a more private place - to have this conversation. - By all means. It's Bill Gates. Okay, well, you are obviously quite upset with me, so go ahead and say what's on your mind. Why did you even invite us here? I invited you here because you're my family. We're not your family. We were your family. - You ran out and reinvented... - Hardin, I thought we were past this. We didn't get past it. How were we supposed to get past it? You haven't owned up to anything! Your twelve steps... making amends. Where's Mum's amends? Mum, have you got your amends yet? What would you like me to do? You don't think that I am consumed by guilt? I knew that night that I had to go. No! After that night you had to stay! And you didn't! That night happened because of you! Yes! And I have been haunted by it for the last ten years! It haunts you?! I fucking watched it happen, you bastard! I'm sorry, Mum. I had to. No, wait. You don't have to get an Uber. I can give you a ride. After the shit you've just pulled? Not to mention you're drunk. Look, I'm sorry I'm not like you. You may be able to forget everything he did, but I can't. I haven't forgotten anything. I've chosen to forgive him so that I can move on. Hardin, resentments like this are gonna destroy you. And they're gonna take Tessa right down with you. I'm going for a walk. Fuck! Hardin. Hardin. Hardin! Hold that, please! Oh. And I thought I was the only Grinch who worked the day after Christmas. We have gotta stop meeting like this. You're right. I'll have restraining orders drafted immediately. How was your Christmas? Uneventful. Yours? Eventful. That's a loaded response. Well, I'd love to hear more about your eventful Christmas, so... lunch? Postmates. I'm buying. How could I refuse? Great. I'll email you some menus. I know, very chivalrous of me. I thought that things were getting better, but... it's clear that he still has a lot of stuff he has to deal with. And I just feel really bad for him... and I don't know how to fix it. Well, let me ask you this. Are you in love with him? - I am. - Then you got yourself a problem. Those are your words of wisdom? Hey, I never said I had any words of wisdom. No, you just wanted to know whether I actually loved him. I should get back to work. Thank you for lunch. Next time it's on me. I don't think there's gonna be a next time. Ouch. No, not like that, believe me. I'm moving to Seattle. Vance offered me the Head of Finance position at the new office. Oh, my God. Trevor, that's amazing. Thanks. Well, ya know, I don't leave tomorrow. We could still... that's... No, that's stupid. Tessa. My sister has struggled with addiction her whole life. This thing between you and Hardin... it's not gonna end well. Well, you're wrong. This one's better anyway. You're never gonna show me what you're writing in there, are you? Maybe... someday. You don't wanna see who that is? I know who it is. It's Steph. The frat house is having a New Year's Eve party. Right. Do you wanna go? No. I don't wanna leave you here alone. I wouldn't be alone. I'd go with you. Sorry, I... I just thought after everything that happened - that you wouldn't want to... - I'm not scared of them. Besides, if it blows up in my face, then we can just stay in next year. What was that for? I just loved how you said "next year." Hello? Tessa, why aren't you in the office? Well, yeah, I... I thought it was... I'm kidding. Happy New Year. Yes! You got me. I'll cut to the chase. We went with the manuscript you recommended, and it sold today in quite a bidding war. Wow, that's... that's fantastic. Listen, we were gonna hire someone to do digital submissions in Seattle, but... you're better than anyone I've interviewed. I'll take care of your tuition, living expenses, provided you transfer. Obviously, Hardin's welcome to join you. Wow, that... uh, that sounds really amazing. Um, can you give me a chance to think about it, please? Of course. I just wanted to share the good news. Happy New Year, Tess. Happy New Year, sir. Hey. Were you talking to me? Nope. What is taking so long? Being a woman. Now, can you go wait outside? - So sorry. - Thanks. Undefeated! Fuck! - It's okay. - Sorry. Sorry. We've missed you. Are we good? Ancient history. You guys wanna get in on this? Yeah, you can take my place. Go. I'll watch. I like to watch. Yeah, I bet you do. Okay, sure. You know what you're doing, right? - Not a clue. - Awesome. Great. Tessa! Mmm. Mm. What is that? Cherry vodka sour. Cool. This is fun! - Yes! - Yes! Drink, bitch! Whoo! I like this! - Nice job! One more! - Aowww! I... suck at this. Jamie. Hey. - It is you. - Hi. Can I talk to you upstairs? Lead the way. Molly's here! You fucking kidding me? Fuck this. So cool, all those gears. You're like a robot. Who says I'm not? I have a tattoo of a little butterfly, but you can only see it when I'm naked. - I love butterflies. - Really? Yeah. Hey! I was looking for you. Hey. Let's leave. Okay. Aww. If it isn't the cute couple together again. Oh, yay. It's Molly. - Where you guys going? - We're going home. Ohh. Lame. Come on, it's almost New Year's. - We just wanna be alone. - Let's go. Good. She never really fit in, anyway. One drink. What... Tess. Excuse me, lovebirds, you're on my chair. - Seriously? - Yeah. Now, fuck off. Move. Bitch. Yes, I am druuuunk! Would anybody like some weed brownies? I made 'em myself. - No. - Oh, I'm good. Well, this is fun. Can we leave? We should play a game. Like what, Scrabble? How about... - Truth or Dare? - Jesus Christ. - Why is that bad? - Long story. - Why would you say that? - Because. What's the matter, Hardin? Scared of a little Truth or Dare? Fuck you, Molly. I'll go first. Hey, Tess, truth or dare? Truth. Uh, are you a virgin? Molly, don't. Oh. Duh. I already know the answer to that, because Hardin fucked you. Yes, he did. My turn. Molly, truth or dare? Hmm, truth. Is it true that you're a whore? Oh, shit. What the fuck did you just call me? I didn't call you anything. I just asked you a question. Are you a whore? - You are. - You have to answer honestly, because it's called Truth for a reason. No. Do they not like each other? Hey, Tess, my turn again. - Truth or dare? - Truth. Is it true that you're a dumb-ass for getting back together with Hardin after he clearly fucked you for a bet? Let's go. No, that's not true. Oh... but it is. You believe anything that comes out of his mouth. I fucking hate you, Molly. Which I don't blame you, because, oh, man, what that mouth can do. And that tongue... Get away from me! - You, like that, whore! - Ohh! Tessa, relax! Awww... You're a whore! Get that fuckin' bitch out of here! Happy new year, bitch! Fuck you, Tessa! Get off me! And you, move the fuck out of my way! - ...UFC or some.. - UFC? I needed that. I'll bet you did. - Ahhh. - You're crazy. I know. Aaah! Pants. Ms. Young, are you objectifying me? Why, yes, I am, Mr. Scott. Right. Three minutes till New Year! Whooo! Is the door locked? Fuck the door, I don't know. - Oh, my God. - Am I your god? Yeah! Thirty seconds! Whooo! Fuck off! Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! We're set. Hey. I'm gonna use the bathroom. Tessa, your phone. - What? - Your phone. Hardin? Hey, you! - Happy New Year. - Hey. I'm really glad we did that. Me too. Do me a favor and just keep it between us? Of course. I never kiss and tell. Thank you. Uh-oh. You piece of shit! Tessa, wait! - Hey. Hey! - Just hear me out. What the fuck?! - Dude, she kissed me. - Fuck off! Tessa, what the fuck! How can you do that?! Why do you care, huh? You just kissed that girl. No, no, no, you don't get to cry! You just fucking kissed a guy right in front of me! - And what did you do, huh? - Nothing! - The fuck is wrong with you?! - She just said that she doesn't kiss and tell, you fucking liar! It's a figure of speech! You should know I would never fucking cheat on you! Were you with her tonight? Is she who you disappeared with the whole night?! Yes! - I was trying to make her forgive me. - For what?! Because I'm trying to be a better person for you! That's all I fucking do! Tell me what else I can do to make you believe that I love you. Tell me! You're never gonna trust me. Trust you? You think that I should trust you. Yes! Where has that ever gotten me? You're never gonna forgive me, are you? You're just gonna keep bringing it up, every time. Because I don't trust you! You act like you're so fucking innocent. Like you're perfect. Oh, fuck this. And fuck you! Fuck you too. Fuck off! Hardin. Hardin? Hey. Hey. Do you have a charger? In my car. Hardin, can you please pick up the phone? I really need to talk to you. Make a left on Oakwood. Hello? Oh, my God. - Stop the car. - I can't. - Stop your fucking car! - Okay! Tessa! Tessa! Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Tessa...! Theresa Young? Yes, hello? - Mercy Hospital. - Hello, yes? - Can I help you? - Theresa Young. She's 19. - I don't see that patient. - She should be there. You're the fifth hospital I've spoken to! - Don't fucking put... Fuck! - Hardin! The fuck is wrong with you? How could you do this to Tessa? - Tessa? Where is she? - I'm not telling you. - Landon, where is she?! - I'm not telling you! - Tell me where she is! - It's your fault she crashed! You didn't come home last night! Get off of me! She was out looking for you. I don't believe you. Tessa? What do you want, Hardin? Trevor? - Trevor, what the fuck are you doing with Tessa's phone? - I'm with her now. - Let me talk to her. - That's not gonna happen. Trevor, I'm not fucking playing with you! Shut the fuck up and listen to me. You're toxic and you're bad news. If you love Tessa, and I think that you do, let her go. Trevor, I just wanna talk to her. Please. Please. Trevor, please, just let me talk to her. Give her a chance to find happiness in this life, 'cause she's never gonna find it with you. Here you go, hon. Hey, good news. Vance's company policy is going to put your hospital and car fees on it, so... Here's your phone. Hardin. "My dearest Tessa, "like all our favorite stories, "there are happy and unhappy endings. "I thought we had a chance for a happy one, "but at last, it was not mean to be. "I love you with all of my heart, "and that's exactly why I had to get as far away from you as possible. "We're like an addiction to each other, with equal parts pleasure... - "and pain." - Because I don't trust you! "And as for that other night, that girl, "she was one of my former conquests. "I had to apologize for my past in order to have a future with you, "but fate just... seems to get in our way. "So let's cut the bullshit. "You're too damn good for me, and I know it. "And somewhere in the back of my mind "I always knew we wouldn't last, "and I think you did, too. "I know this is going to be painful at first, "and it could take days, even more. "But one of those days, you're going to wake up "and the sorrow will start to slip away... "until we're nothing but a distant memory. Goodbye, Tessa." You have to call me. We need to talk about this, okay? You can't disappear for nine days. Call me. Call me. Tessa?! Hardin, help me! It's okay. Thank you. How are the applications going? Fine. Dad said he'd make some calls. You two spoke? How'd that go? As well as it could. Hardin, what happened that night, it wasn't his fault. And all the other nights? Not his fault? Yeah, it was shit. It was shit, and we both deserved better. But the only person you're punishing by not forgiving him is yourself. And Hardin, I want you to stop punishing yourself. So you think it's fair that he gets to live in that big, fancy house, and you're here all alone? Who said I was alone? What? You're seeing someone? - You don't have to sound so surprised. - Who? - Mike. - Mike? - Wanker-from-next-door Mike? - He's not a wanker! - He is a bit of a wanker. - He's a really nice man, and he treats me well. Yeah, he fucking better. Did you hear that Vance was moving to Seattle? Tessa's going too. How did you know? Well, we talk from time to time. He's having a going-away party on Sunday, and I think you should get your ass off this sofa and go get her. - No, I can't. - Can't? Or you don't want to face what you left behind? I'd have to leave right now. So what are you waiting for? - Mum, I'm not gonna... - Hardin... I love you, but you have to start fighting for what really matters. Thank you all so much for coming. It means the world to me to have everyone I love here with us. I am... beyond proud of the work that everyone in this room has done, but there is one particular person I could not have done any of this without. And that's Kimberly. Smith and I were talking the other day, and he said, "Dad, going-away parties are kind of sad." And he's got a point. And we were like, "How do we make this a celebration?" Then we got an idea. Kimberly... will you marry my dad and be my stepmom? Aww... Yes! Yes! What about me? - Aww... - Yay! Who said happy endings don't exist? Don't tell me. You're the cynic. I'm turning over a new leaf. You look very pretty, by the way. So... have you made up your mind about Seattle? Well, I don't see much of a reason to pass up the opportunity anymore. That's... really nice to hear. Look, Tessa, there's something I actually want to get off my chest. Okay. Uh, the other day, in the hospital... I answered your cell phone, it was Hardin, and I told him to stay away from you. - What? - In retrospect, I do realize that that was over the line, and I do realize that I let my emotions get the best of me, and I'm sorry, but somehow you bring that side out of me, so... Okay. Are you okay? Eh. There's actually more I'd like to say, - but would you excuse me for a second? - Yeah. Thanks. I'm so sorry. Shit. She left from the front. Thank you. Tessa! You're just never gonna leave me alone, are you? I tried. So, you two have a good Christmas? O-kay, you're not talkin'. So... hey, so I was dreamin' of a white Christmas. Hmph! All I got was heat. You know, I hate the heat. Heat get into people's minds and make them do some crazy things. Like I said, this is a story you've heard before. Only difference is, this is our story. Tessa's and mine. "I never wish to be parted from you from this day on." And who knows? Maybe there is a happy ending for us after all. Tess. - Hey... - Hardin! - Dad? - "Dad"? I guess we'll just have to find out. - Tessa. - Tessa. Tessa. Do you like to go on dates? Because I don't. But I-I will... with you. If you wanna go. Tessa. That's so creepy. I've been meaning to tell you something for a long time, and the reason that I haven't told you is because of Human Resources in the workplace. Don't talk about Human Resources. That's not... sexy. Tessa! Don't do the finger. Put it down! I only pull out my teal suit when I have something important to say. Occupied. Tessa. There's other bathrooms in the house if you need to go that badly. Just go. Yes. You can go now.
