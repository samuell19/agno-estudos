PSALMS Somewhere in Jerusalem today This old teaching clarifies a specific point, which helps us understand the topic better. The teaching speaks about a man who cannot see. In which direction should he pray? A blind, a man who can't see where the West, East, North, or South is, and can't locate himself. Who could that be for instance? A man who can't locate himself, who can't find the cardinal points: someone who is on a boat at sea, in the desert, in a place from which he can't orient himself, is considered blind. He can't know where to turn to, therefore he has a problem praying. A disoriented person should turn his heart to His Father in Heaven. If you don't know where Jerusalem is, the Western Wall, where the Temple was, what should you do? What does the teaching suggest? To turn our hearts to Our Father in Heaven. I want to expose this problem to you, I find it interesting. Think about it, what's the difference between the Temple Mount, as a direction for prayer, and Our Father in Heaven? Two very different things. When directed towards Jerusalem, what should one think about in one's mind, in one's heart? "Standing in the Holy of Holies, the Great Priest, on Yom kippur, "was about to pray." In which direction would he pray? He would turn his heart towards the Holy Ark, meaning he was looking at the Cherubim. Today we don't really remember, but on the Ark of the Covenant there were two angellike characters. The two Cherubim, standing next to the Holy Throne of the king of kings, they were made of gold, and they were the recipient of God's Presence. The Great Priest would turn his heart to The Ark of Covenant. Now let's sum up what we've learnt today, one standing in the East, turns towards the West, one in the West, turns towards the East, one in the South, turns towards the North, one in the North, towards the South, and so: all of Israel, shall turn their hearts to one place. Bye bye. See you next week. - Be well. God be with you. I didn't cut the salad yet. Put knives and forks please. David! Set the table. Ok. How was the study today? It was good. Very good. What was it about? We studied about praying... Chapter 4. It was interesting. Not at the table, David. I have to study, I have a science exam tomorrow. In what? - Science, about water. After eating we'll work on it. - No, the teacher wiIl yell at me. No one wiIl yell at you. Don't worry. She always does. After lunch, Dad or me wiIl sit with you, Ok? I'm not hungry. So sit with us without eating. Did you wash your hands? Is it Ok if Aaron comes over for Shabbath? What's that? - I study in the meantime. Now you're eating, you'll study later. But I have to know it. Next Shabbath? - What do you think? Aaron is coming for Shabbath? - I want to invite him. Yes, invite him! What do you say, Mom? - Good idea. Haven't seen him in a while. He'll spend Shabbath with us. But he won't sleep in my room. Mine neither. Why mine? You give your room. - Why me? You're younger, so you'll respect the elder. You're older, so respect the Iittle one. I'm older and I need privacy. He'll sleep with you... Where do you want him to sleep? In your room. - No, in yours. What are you fighting about? No argument! Dad wants Aaron to sleep over, so we help. You'll be in David's room, because it's bigger. Nothing to argue about. Well, Ok. Menachem, where are you going? We haven't finished yet. Menachem! - Leave him alone. Come Dad, I'm late. - You have a girlfriend? What do you mean? They're waiting for me. Just Iisten to your Mom, that's all. But all my friends stay out late. Yes, but they have their own parents to worry about them. Your Mom has you. You'll respect her and Iisten. I'm counting on you. - All right. Look, Mom is worried. You don't understand her. There's nothing to worry about. - Nothing? When you come at 5 in the morning, it's worrying. So Iisten to her, and give respect. You're not alone at home. What can I tell you. I'm telling you, you shouldn't worry so much. It's easy to say "don't worry". When you worry, you worry... Don't worry. - Take good care. It wiIl be Ok. Where were you? We've been waiting for an hour. Come on, let's go. How are you? - Fine. What's up? - I'm good. I don't want to. - Come on, you always smoke. Come on, smoke a bit. What about you, Menachem? At last. What's going on? What do gazelles do at night? They cross their legs... So you'd be with me? I'll tell you later. Pass me the beer. Let's sing a song in Hebrew. Something popular. Maybe I could come in for a Iittle. We'll wake my parents up. Ok. - Ok. Me too... Maybe I walk you to the door. - No, it's fine. I'll go in. -Ok. That's a bad start! - We won't make it. Why not? You should wake up earlier. I woke up. - You woke up. Tell your brother. Take your bag. Take it. Why do I have to leave the house so stressed? Tell me. It's not me who was late. - Not you? It's nobody, right? So who was it? Isn't it Menachem? - Put on your seat-belt. It's not my fault at all. - Menachem. -Sure... Shut up, both of you. Ok? He always wakes up late. - That's enough. He should wake up earlier next time. I did. - You did? Maybe next time you can wake up sooner. Are you doing this on purpose? You're so annoying. And you know it. David! - What? Watch it! - I do. I'm not doing anything. So stop. - Cut it out, shut up. I don't want to shut up. I'm warning you. You'll regret it. I can't take it anymore. Stop it. Don't speak. I wiIl if I want. - No you won't. I can. - You won't because it's annoying. You do everything right? You're such a good boy... Stop it. That's enough. Dad, why didn't you stop at school? Dad. - Where are you going? Go get some help. Get us help. Get help. It's here... My Dad and my brother are here. Show me what happened. It's my Dad and my brother. I'm Iistening. - Here. Search the car. My brother's been Iike this for a while. Injury. Order an ambulance. Search unit here. Send ambulance. I've got an 8 year-old boy hurt. My Dad was here and he's not here anymore. He was driving? - I don't know where he is. When you left the car your Dad was all right? He had his seat belt on? Did he get a knock in the face? No, he talked to me, he told me to get help. I see. How did the accident happen? I don't know where he is. - Don't worry about your Dad. Did he go off lane? Was he tired, asleep? Hey, Iittle one. Everything's Ok. Suddenly... - You don't remember? Don't move, I'll put a collar on, to protect you neck. Does it hurt? ...he went off the road. Your head? We'll put you on a stretcher, Ok? We'll take you to the hospital. WiIl he be Ok? - He'll be fine. -Holding? They'll take him for a check. Are you with us? Don't worry about your Dad. We'll get some back up. We're the first rescue team, we'll take care of it, Ok? It looks fine. Don't worry. More police are on their way. Check him, he said he was dizzy. We have an accident here. Are there people hurt? - Yes. On our way. Over. - Two injured. Please report.

Beautiful. Let me see you. Eli! Eli! Eli Frankel! I'd Iike to read this chapter for my son. May his merits save him so he comes home in peace. This Magnificent Prayer of king David, who was in the cave, escaping his oppressors. He would say: Where shall I turn, Where shall I escape. I can only turn to You. A Contemplation of David. A prayer when he was in a cave. I cry out to God with my voice; with my voice to God I make my supplication. I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then You knew my path. In the way where I walk, have they privily laid a snare for me. Look on my right, and see, no man recognized me, refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cried unto You, O God You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the Iiving. Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low, deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Your Name, the righteous shall compass me about; for You shall deal bountifully with me. I have to tell you what the Jewish Law says, although we don't know where he is, we are sure he is stiIl alive. Meaning there is no mourning. We don't grieve, we don't say the prayer for the dead, God forbid. This is very far from our heart, we assume he is stiIl alive. You shouldn't deal with these aspects. I think there is an opportunity here as a family. For each one of you and together. As long as Eli isn't here, we have to think of one another. There's one thing that is important, that I would add: I know you pray, and each one of you can pray, but I would also suggest it's very important to give Charity. Charity means that I don't hold on to all I've got, all the blessing that's been given to me, but I must let it flow out to the world. When God sees this, He organizes the world to help the one who gives. Did you get any news? Nothing. Why don't you come to school? I don't want to talk to people. Does your Mom know? - It doesn't matter. It wiIl be Ok, don't worry. Yes. I'm here, really. It's gonna be all right. I need to go back soon. Ok, go. It's fine. I need to go. - You want me to come with you? No, they're coming soon. I'll always be here for you. Bye, Menachem. Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Your name, the righteous shall compass me about; for You shall deal bountifully with me. Let's go, it's time. Thank you for coming. It's very kind. What else can we do? - Thank you. I don't want to play, I'm tired. Alma, Menachem, we're going. I appreciate your presence, please keep praying, and keep thinking of Eli, so he comes back in peace. Goodbye. Alma. Alma! I want to thank you for what you did, letting all the people come and pray. l know we haven't always been a close family, you've had your ways, l've had mine. But these are hard times and we need to help each other. l want this house to be a place of prayer. That more and more people come until Eli comes back. All right? Good night. Thank you Alma. l'm going to rest, finish up. - Mom? How are you? - Ok. lt's hard. We have an appointment with lnspector kaufman. Sit down please.

Can you take this with you? Come, please. She asks if the boy can stay outside. Good morning. Alma Frankel. - lnspector kaufman. You asked to come with the children, but could the little one stay outside? That's fine. How are you? All right. - Good. Wait for me here. - keep an eye on him. But l want to listen. l'll tell you everything afterwards, please sit here. Mom will come soon. Follow me. Sit down, please. l've asked you to come to tell you exactly what's going on. The investigation is at a point where we're completely at a loss. We don't know anything. We don't know if he's in the country and if he is, whether he's hiding, if he's under a false identity, if he's hurt, if he's been killed. We don't know anything. l'm sorry for what you're going through, but that's the situation. The thing is that our bank account has been frozen, and it's hard to sustain ourselves without it. l don't know how long we're going to last, and l don't know who can help me with that. What happens now is that in a few days, if we have no results, we transfer the case to the lntelligence Office, and they should issue a Missing Person Certificate. With this, you can turn to the authorities, Court, Social Security, and they'll take care of you. l'm sorry for what you're going through, it's inherent to this case, which is unusual and may take years. We'll contact you once in a while, for more information concerning the investigation. l'm very sorry. Stay strong. Thank you. Come, David. "... people outside the castle.

Just for the lawyer, so he presents it like that to them. l don't know, but... Take him up to the gate, Ok? - Fine. Hello. Hey, Menachem, how are you? What's up? - Hello, Yossi.

"And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps "over against the candlestick, as God commanded Moses. "And this work of the candlestick "was of beaten gold, unto the shaft, unto the flowers, "was beaten work, "according to the pattern which God had showed Moses, "so he made the candlestick." You understood? Well. When it says: "Shaft, unto the flower", what does "Shaft, unto the flower" mean? Shaft, down, flower, up. One piece. The candlestick was made of one big piece of gold. And Grandpa? Was the candlestick big? - Very big. How many branches to it? - Seven. Seven, right. What else is seven? Days. - Right. What's the seventh day? Shabbath. These seven days stand for continuity, for a whole. Seven days, then another seven, then, Aaron... Seven days, and so on. Eternity. That's Eternity. And Grandpa? Will Eternity ever stop? No. What do you think? About what? Me. You what? What do you think about me? l love you. Love me? Love. l love you too. - Really? Yes. Love me? Love. Menachem, wake up!
