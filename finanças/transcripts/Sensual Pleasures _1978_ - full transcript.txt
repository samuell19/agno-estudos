But a wrongful death is not acceptable either To die for a beautiful lady and be a promiscuous ghost, could that be so? At least you'll dance a gig or two There's a verse popular with theatre performers Death is like a lamp being extinguished; Reincarnation is like finding the moon at the bottom of the sea I've got the moon but so what? Death is the be all and end all My reincarnation is useless all things have changed Where are you off to? It's the height of winter, go home!

Old bastard Damn you "Zhao Residence" Life and death, difficult to see true friendship Dead and alive, true friendship does exist Who cares for me? Who loves me? My wife She even made an altar for me Crocodile tears Go and have a look Don't be too sad dad has died for 7 days That's the first week after the death, don't cry Take care of your health Would be bad if you harm your body by over-grieving I feel bad I know. You're so young how could you? Don't be sad. I'm back, don't cry I am alive again Look, what a pair I little thought you'd be so good to me Why cry like this? Does it sound like someone crying? Damn, you say you suffer I am the one who really suffers, bitch Lu Ping, my good friend What bloody friend? I don't want it I cannot wait any longer Everyone knows I am the best of friends with old Zhao It's only 6 days since he died how could I marry you? What's your concern? It's common in many places in China Besides, you're good friends We need to consider his son Zhao Ming's feelings What for? He looks down on me I was married to old Zhao for 5, 6 years he never addressed me as mom Why should we give him face? I get it, you... It's all because of that wife of your managing director Bitch, what cousins are you talking of? Anyone remotely related is a 'cousin' Apart from your managing director Jin Rong Lu Almost everyone knows that you and his wife have an affair Alright...don't bring this up, ok? Take it easy...don't rush Isn't this nice? Slowly again When old Zhao was alive we had to be surreptitious Now that he is dead, what's to fear? Of course it's good for you You can do it openly or discreetly Kill 2 birds with 1 stone, it's good for you naturally Be careful of what others might say Mourning is a ritual as a show to the living Otherwise why wear a white flower? Of course to let you see! I want to make you happy I still want it Still want more? Oh, heavens! Four is better than three You said you wouldn't mind if troubles surrounded you It would be the sixth time Six is a lucky number! After midnight it'd be the 1st week after old Zhao died If he doesn't do it himself who could stand in for him? Aren't you called Lu Bun? According to your name, you're quite powerful No way... Well? Enough? Almost We could get dad's insurance of thirty thousand dollars tomorrow Old Suen and the others will get five thousand each It's fifty thousand all together We could start our company now Isn't that great? Nothing is perfect in this world If dad didn't die, we couldn't have had insurance money Now that he's dead, we could start the company It's good in a way. If he knew about Lu Bun and your step mother he'd have died in anger instead of illness After you told me I really got mad. If you hadn't stopped me, I'd have told dad It'd be no use, would he have believed it? One is an old friend one is his wife If you'd have told him he would have said you couldn't accept her Please draw the blinds What should I do? If the insurance company knows that I haven't died my son's future would be ruined And with such a wife how could I return home with dignity? Forget it, let me find the managing director I've followed him my whole life I should have some credit I'll borrow some money from him and get away from here What the eyes don't see, it doesn't exist! Madam Huang Would you go see who it is at this late hour? Yes Coming...who is it? Madam Huang Mr. Zhao Is the managing director here? Yes... Please come in Who is it? It's Mr. Zhao Mr Jin Old Zhao What brings you here at this late hour? Small matter Come in... Thanks Have a seat Who is it? Old Zhao Which old Zhao? Zhao Shi Yi Mrs Jin Madam... Are you alright? Mrs Jin I am Zhao Shi Yi Ghost... What are you talking about? It's old Zhao Old Zhao Zhao Shi Yi! Yes, Mrs Jin. You don't recognise me? Isn't he dead? I see... You see now! I am old Zhao You are Zhao Shi Yi Right This gown you're wearing was put in with your burial Nonsense Of all people why would you want to impersonate Zhao Shi Yi? Why would I need to impersonate him? I am him Zhao Shi Yi? Don't you know he's dead? Yes, my wife did mention that I have died for 6 days Tomorrow is the seventh day You have died for 6 days? Right Is your visa to Feng Du not ready yet? Not really; they said my death was a mistake A mistake? You haven't forgotten any procedure, is it? No... I...well... Well what? You are Zhao Shi Yi? Tell me frankly what do you want? Please don't misunderstand I just want to... It's a long story Long story? You want to borrow money? I...want to leave this place so people wouldn't know I have returned from the dead I... My son wouldn't get the insurance money You have a kind heart But, of all people why do you have to impersonate Zhao Shi Yi? When he was alive, he thought he made substantial contributions to my company and also that he started the business for me He exploited this and was full of himself My patience with him was stretched You'd think I smiled at him Iistened to him and satisfied his every wish because he had a hold on me So you chose to impersonate him for blackmailing me! Wake up! I tell you If it wasn't for Lu Bun who put in a good word for him I'd have fired him long ago Lu Bun put in a good word for me? You know, he happens to be my wife's cousin I would have to take care of him Lu Bun had an affair with old Zhao's wife Apart from old Zhao the whole world knew about it I pity poor old Zhao so I controlled myself Is that clear? Is that clear? Zhao Shi Yi, listen well Great Life and death, difficult to see true friendship Dead and alive, true friendship does exist I'll not borrow a cent from you Don't worry But I have to tell you: Your wife's cousin Lu Bun calls your wife 'cousin' on the face of it but they have a different relationship in bed! Is that clear? Is that clear? Is that clear, Mr. Jin Rong Lu? Nonsense You are talking nonsense Nonsense, huh? Why would I talk nonsense? Jin Rong Lu, your cuckolded head is obvious to the whole world except yourself. Phew! What rubbish! Ice is cold, but colder are men's hearts; The World is full of treachery, more treacherous are men's hearts Appearances often deceive Human nature is fickle, and so is friendship Until death, I won't give in; won't give up until I get what I want Everything is clear and I should go back to my coffin It's cold, yet the coffin is warm I told you it's cold outside Why go out? I'll have to come back eventually Get up I said get up! Get up...go out What's up? I said go out Go out? Nonsense, is this coffin yours? Of course What? It's yours Look Over there Damn it I only have this coffin, and you fight with me for it The one from Hebei stand here What's your name? Zhao Shi Yi Am I right? I said you're smothered to death! Over here... Line up... Foreigners, attention French, American, British go to gate six Russians, listen up Really?

Heaven knows, earth knows, you and I know It ain't the wine but the drinker who gets himself drunk What do you mean?

How could that be? How could it taste of man? What do you mean? Taste of man? You said it just now Did I say that? You said it I said the wine has a taste of man? You just said it Did l? You did I meant human touch As the saying goes having friends is good for wine, smoking and gambling That's why I say, in our Three Stars Wine Shop The more you drink, the more you feel the human touch Wine and drinker become as one and friendship becomes deeper Right, wine and drinker become as one Xiao Hu Zi, cheers No...

Come on, speak up Er Guo Tou Don't worry, we'll pay up front You have 3 months to deliver, no problem Right... Boss Zang, it's not a matter of money You are our regular customers Right! I can't show favoritism! Besides, brewing wine is not turning on the tap you can't just turn it on and expect wine will flow It takes time Time is not an issue you can take up to 6 months, take the payment first... If 6 months are not enough, take a year or even a year and a half if need be We're old friends, take the deposit first Don't be so fussy! Just take the money! No... I can't take it What if I can't deliver by the deadline? It doesn't work that way Wouldn't want me to add water to the wine, would you? Three Stars Wine Shop, how could it? We believe you Take it... Alright... But I am reluctant! Thanks... Uncle, this won't work You've got to find someone to work! Find someone to work? Too many people, too much gossip Can you keep an eye on him all day? If someone knows that your Uncle is there in the pot we'll be finished Well... You keep on adding water How many pots can we still make? Now wine and man have taste of each other Later, wine and water will mix together and water would have the taste of wine Will that mess up the whole thing? That's easy At that time we don't add water into it instead we put a man inside Nothing more...go to sleep you'll know what to do when the time comes, go to sleep 2nd Uncle I...think about 2nd Uncle You... What are you shouting at? Go...go to sleep Go Disgusting... "Story of Twelve Chinese Knights" Don't be rash!

I ain't drinking this Right! You can't drink this wine Bastard, you're making up rumours and this is not the first time We don't interfere with each other's business You can boast about how good you are but you shouldn't say that other people's stuff is bad There's no problem with your saying that your wine is good Right... but you can't say we're soaking a dead man in our wine Never mind... What do you mean by never mind, finish it with him You bastard Don't you have conscience? What is it? Give me some face Talk things out peacefully Go... It's not my fault, I heard it from other people Who said so? From...

Don't be shameless! Without your wife how could you be the boss of a wine brewery? You are good for nothing C'mon, let's go to the station to seek justice Go...
