Dad, please take a nice photo of us. If Dad takes our photo, it will be great for sure. The photo will be great in this lighting. - Every one, Here we go! - Yes. Okey. Are you ready? Okay. Yenanchaung Township: Present Day Did we have to move this far? My boss wants to open a new branch. Working there will be the same as in Yangon. Siri can meet new friends and play outdoors more. She will feel a lot better. May, rain is trapped around here during the rainy season. When the water dries dangerous burrows form underground. So they are making sure we pass safely. It's become tradition for us to give them something in return. I don't understand. How do you know all this? Didn't you grow up abroad? I'm a photographer. So a photographer knows everything? Well... this photographer is Editor ...in Chief at Myanmar's biggest newspaper. Don't brag. 1 month ago Siri. Let's go home. Siri. Did you hear what I said? Siri. Why? Stop playing and let's go home. Miemie and I are talkingabout something important. Stop talking nonsense let's go home. I don't want to go home! Everything has it's limits. The other... parents are... complaining. That Siri likes to hurt the other children. Give it back. Give it back. Yes, I know. She doesn't get alongwith anyone but her father. She is a perfectly normal girl. She's not autistic like you are saying. There is a saying thatif you can't control your child, you are probably not a good mother. Let me give you some advice. You have to be more serious with Siri. Learn to use discipline. Stop it. Stop. Miemie, let's tell Dad the story. Okay, tell me what happened to Miemie. The other kids bullied her. They pulled her hair. Is she hurt? Do I look dead? I thought I was dead. Am I really dead? You're still alive May. God kept you alive. Now I'm the co-owner of your life. And no one can take you away from me. And most importantly God has given us a beautiful daughter. The teacher says that Siri is autistic. She probably can't go to school anymore. Nonsense How can a teacher speak that way. But... Siri never listens to me. She even treats me like a stranger. And I really don't know how to be good mother for her. I tried everything. I'm so tired. You weren't the one criticized by the teacher. This school... is the third school already. I don't know where else to go. We will... figure it out together. Right? How are you old friend? It's been a long time. The CEO wants us to stay... in this big house? Well, you are a big boss now. I'm not there yet. Come. I have something to show you. Sure. Come in. Come in. Welcome to your new house. Miemie, let's take a look at this big house! Siri, don't run in here! Siri, You'll slip. Siri, Mom has some sweets for you. Come back. Come. Let her play, May. It's fine. She can play in the house. Come here. This house is over 100 years old... Dad, look there are so many butterflies. Help me catch them. Okay. Let me take a photo of you. Okey. Okay smile! This house was built over 100 years ago. It's English colonial architecture... and very well built. Built for the tropics. Is this filmed on glass? That's right. Taken over 50 years ago. Incredible. It cannot be replicated, only one in the world. Look at their eyes. They're almost alive. I knew you'd like them, so kept them for you. DAY 1 Give it back! I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you hurt. Who are you? I'm Thida. I don't have any friends. Can you be my friend? How did you get into this house? I take care of this house Do you want to play? Let's play again. Play again. DAY 2 Is this an old photograph? Yes. And you keep them here? Yes. I wanted to keep... some of the house's memories. But these are not photos of your family, right? No, these photos... belong to... a very famous photographer. Even if the people in these photosare no longer living I feel like... they are still alive. Remember, we must live in the present and leave the past to the past. Yes, Sir. Babe. Babe. Are you okay? Mom, am I dreaming? No, you're not dreaming. You are awake dear. Oh you must've had a bad dream. It's fine babe, you are with your mother. Did you know... well... I'm so afraid... of being a bad mother. Siri is acting exactly like what her teacher said. Perhaps... we really need to control her more. I really... don't want to be like my mother. Yes, she's the one who gave birth to me. I have to thank her for that. And I love her dearly. But... I don't want to be a strict mother like she was. I don't have good memories... growing up at all. But I know she was kind. Honey. Thank you... so much. For bringing us to this house. I love you so much, May. I love you too. DAY 3 Babe. Get up, sweetie. It's time for breakfast. Babe. Siri. Siri. Babe. Babe. Siri. Siri. Siri. Babe. Aung - I can't wake her up. - Don't worry. She probably couldn't sleep last night. She really won't wake up. I've tried so many times. Let her sleep. สายๆค่อยปลุกอีกที Babe. Siri, wake up. It's after lunchtime. - Babe. - Babe. Babe. Are you sick, sweetie? Do you have a fever? Let's find a doctor. Yes, I think we should. Babe. Babe. Babe. Doctor, I don't want to disturb you so many times like this. But my daughter is sleeping all day and she's still not awake yet. My husband is in town finding a doctor. He's not back yet. Does the child have a fever? No, she doesn't. Does she have food poisoning? No. We just can't wake her up doctor. If she doesn't have a fever, don't worry. It's normal... when they don't sleep at night to sleep during the day. Oh doctor ...what if... something is wrong... with her brain? Or something's wrong with her muscles? Don't say things that are impossible. Look, I'm a doctor. It's highly unlikely for a child her age. Her muscles are strong. So please don't make... assumptions yet... Mom. Babe. When they don't sleep... - are you up now sweetie - at night to sleep during the day. - Are you up now sweetie - it's nomal. I'm hungry. Can I have something to eat? I was so worried. Hello. - Doctor. - She's awake? She's awake now Thank you very much She's awake now Okay, Sound good. Are you okay, sweetie? Oh sweetie, are you that hungry? It's very yummy. Don't eat so quickly, you'll choke. Where did you get this dress? I love you so much, Mom. I love you so much too, sweetie. How could you start without me? Dance with us, Dad. Dance together. - Hurry. - I'll dance too. You are so cute, my sweetheart. Time for bed. Good night, sweetie. Are you awake? What time is it, May? It's half past five. Did you play all night? Aung? I... love this house so much. I love you, May. DAY 4 Mom really hates naughty children. Babe. Babe. Siri. Dad. Couldn't sleep, sweetie? Come here. You were asleep all morning and I didn't see you all day. No, I was playing. Where did you get this dirty rag doll? And where's Miemie? Where is your doll, babe? Miemie left me, Dad. Okay, next time don't let her leave then. And what's her name? - Mom. - Yes? Tell me a story. Sure, I'll tell you a story. She's so dirty. Let's give her a bath first, okay? Allright. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Aung. What happened? Did you hear that? Hear what? Dad, I don't want to sleep alone. Why, sweetie? Oh, you must have had a bad dream. Don't worry babe, come sleep with Mom and Dad. Come here. DAY 5 Aung. Could you close the curtains? I want to sleep. I'm glad you moved here. After 10 years, I'm tired of beingthe only Editor in Chief. Check this out, it's incredible. You should like this one. Where did you find it? You're right. They are really beautiful. Can I ask you something? Do you know anything aboutthe house that I'm living in? There is a story from the villagers. The owner was a photographer. A lonely man. Not married no children. But he loved kids and even adopted some. Did he have relatives? Not sure. He disappeared in the '60s and no one saw him again. And those people who lived there. Is anyone still alive? I mean, the kids that lived there. Yes, actually. You've met him. Who? The monk that we invited to your house. - Monk? - Yes. Yes, Monk U Nandiya. Aung, are you okay? Yes, nothing. I'm okay. Hello, Sir. Where can I find Monk U Nandiya? He's not with us anymore. Why do you ask? I wanted to ask about the house I'm living in. I heard that he lived therewhen he was young. I'm so sorry. He's dead. What did you say? I was just with him last Monday. He's Dead. Yes. He passed away on Tuesday. I am so sorry to hear of this. As far as I know, he had one childhood friend. If you find him, he may be able to answer your questions. Can you bring me to see him? He's not here. Siri. Siri. Can I play with you, sweetie? Sure, Dad. Why are you flying Golden Eagle? Babe. Are you playing Golden Eagle? You be the Golden Eagle, okay? Give me the doll. I will protect little sister. You try to catch the little sister. Ready? Why are you flying Golden Eagle? I want little sister. We didn't bring little sister. I can see her behind you. Her flesh is bitter. I'll wash her in the stream. The stream is dry in the summer. I'll wash her in the river. The river is dry in the summer. I'll wash her in the ocean. The ocean is never dry. So, I'll catch little sister! I'm catching her. I'm catching her. I caught her! Yes. I caught her! You caught her. This time you be Golden Eagle okay? Do I have to? Yes. And I'll protect her. Okay. Go. Why are you flying Golden Eagle... I want little sister. Her flesh is bitter. I'll wash her in the stream. The stream is dry in the summer. I'll wash her in the river. The river is dry in the summer. The ocean is never dry. So, I'll catch little sister! I'm catching her. Are you okay, Dad? Dad has to rest, sweetie. Okay. Day 6 Come on. Children. Do you know where U Yaw Zaw lives? Over there. Over there? - Thanks. - Yes. Can you please tell me about this house? I don't know this house. Aren't you friends with U Htun Myat? Yes, I'm his brother. But we're not blood related. And he's in another world now. He's living in a peaceful place now. Give him peace. I really... need to say my prayers now. Just a minute, Sir. Can I ask you one more thing? It's about my family. Since moving into this house, my wife and daughter seem different. They are not themselves anymore. How so? They... sleep during the day and stay up at night. I don't know anything about this. Are these children still alive? Is there a way to find them? Have you heard of Amay Gyan? No, I haven't. Amay Gyan. If you worship her. She gives you luck and protects you. Uncle. Where can I find thechildren in this photo? They are all gone. One of the children is Monk U Nandiya who just passed away. You're too late. I'm really sorry. Okay. Thank you for the information. ผมขอตัวก่อน I'll excuse myself. Take this. It may be useful. You're home late again. Are you feeling sick? Are you tired? I'm fine, May. Have you eaten anything yet? Actually, I forgot to eat. I'll go prepare food for you then. May. Does Siri seem different to you these days? What do you mean? She seems fine. Usually... She doesn't like dirty dolls. Her habits are different. Isn't that a good thing? But I like the way things are now. Before moving here I never felt like a mother. Actually, Siri is acting better now. But I don't feel like she's our daughter. That's nonsense. If she's not our daughter, then who is she? I'm serious. I don't know our daughter anymore. But I know her well. Siri is good and she's a good daughter. You're the one who's different coming home late every night. You've changed, not her. Mom, I want to hear a story. You've changed, not her. Mom, I want to hear a story. Sure. Let's go upstairs and I'll tell you a story. After hearing that Prince Nanda died, her heart was broken and she died. And that's the end of the story. Mom, do you think I'm naughty? Why do you ask that? Dad never plays with me anymore. Sweetie. Dad works very hard, so that we could move into this house. Dad had to quit his old job. He has lots of adjustments to make. Sweetie understands him right? Ritht? Do you love me, Mom? Of course I love you. I love you the most in the whole world. I love you so much. Love you so much. Love so much. How could you do this? Give me back my body! Mom really hates naughty children. DAY 5 DAY 4 DAY 3 DAY 2 DAY 1 NIGHT 1 Am I dreaming? What do you mean? NIGHT 2 If you don't know, just pinch yourself. See, you're not dreaming. Thida, how did you learn to take pictures? Sure. My dad is a very famous photographer. My dad too. He likes to take photos of me. I love my dad more than my mom. Dad is a very kind artist. He's not mean like Mom. She's mean? She's always angry? Look up. What is that? This helps us take longer exposures. Why do you have to do that? I don't know either. My dad said we have to do this if you want a good picture. Make like this. Good pictures canhold the spirit inside. Who are you? I'm Thida. Where are you going, Thida? Thida, open the door! Thida, open the door! Don't leave me here! Thida, open the door! Don't lock me up here, Thida! Thida, open the door! Why are these kids in here again? Thida? You are such a naughty girl. I'll really punish you this time. I'm tired of telling you. Who's this cute girl? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Honey, what's wrong? Did you hear that, May? No, I didn't. Dad, I don't want to sleep alone. Why, dear? You must've had a nightmare, sweetie.

Let her sleep. We played all night, she must be tired. She can sleep later. She should wake up now. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? You're not thinking straight. Our child isn't normal anymore. Why is she only awake at night? She was playing with me all night. She's tired. And how come you're awake? We're adults. Children need more time to sleep. Anyone who gets slapped like that should wake up. May. You love Siri so much. So do I. But this isn't right. What if something is wrong with her? What if she's really sick? We need to know the truth. Try waking her up. At least she should open her eyes. Please try waking her up. Babe. Babe. Babe. Open your eyes for Mom. Babe. Try to wake up, sweetie. Please open your eyes, sweetie, for Mom. Please, sweetie. Babe. Babe. Babe. Siri. Babe. What should we do, Aung? Aung, what are you doing? Aung What is that? What did you put in her eye? Holy water. She's still breathing. Aung. What should we do? What should we do now? What should we do now? Why did you have to do that? Aung. Why did you have to do that? Why? Why did you have to hurt her this badly? I didn't do anything bad to her. I just poured holy water on her. It shouldn't hurt a normal person. You keep saying Normal! Normal! I can see that our child... is totally normal. No, she's not. What normal child sleeps all day and stays up all night? She sings old songs, plays with old toys. That's not our child. How can you say that? Why do you have to say that? How can you say that? Whatever she is. She's still our daughter. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Siri. Siri. Babe. Babe. Babe. May. Babe. Babe. Siri. Siri. Where are you going? Did you hear me? Babe. Babe. Why are you running away? Did you hear me? Babe. Babe. Help me! Aung, help me! Help me! Help me! Aung! Help me! เมย์ เมย์ Aung! Help me! Aung! Aung! She's gone. She was just here before I left. Babe. Siri. Siri. Babe. Who are you? I'm asking, who are you? Who are you? Mom. Who are you? My name is Thida. What do you want? I want a gentle mother like you. Where is your mother? I only have a father. He's not here right now. We live with our adoptive mom. But I am afraid of her. She's very cruel. I have to be in this body so she won't find me. Where is Siri? Please tell me where Siri is. She's not here right now. I am still looking for her. What did you do to her? Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth. I'm telling the truth. I just wanted to play with her. I didn't know it would be like this. I really love both of you. If you really loved us why are you lying? You are not our child. I hate liars. Give us Siri back. Or I'll kill you right now. Give me my daughter back! I don't know where she is. I can't find her. You're lying. No, I'm not lying. You're lying. I will make you speak the truth. May, hold her. Hold her. Please don't hurt me.

Help me, Dad! Help me, Dad! - Babe. - Dad! Please help me! What should we do! Mom! Babe. Mom! What should we do! Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Your mother wants to see you, Kyaw Zaww. Everyone else is gone. It's my turn. I want you to call my daughter back. Please help me. Mother... ...is someone who wantssomething she can't have. Your daughter's not dead. But she's a spirit. So, how can we get her back? Nobody can call her back. You need help from Amay Gyan. I haven't been back here in over 50 years. For my entire life, I will never forget what happened to me in that house. Dad was a very warm man. He took care of us just likewe were his own family. He made our family a happy one. Come. Come on, Dad photographer soon. - Really? - Yes. He was a very skilled photographer. Please take a nice photo of us, Dad. We were very proud of him. It will be great for sure. - Dad, if you take our photo it will be great. - Yes, that's for sure. The photo will be great in this lighting. Nice. We seemed like a happy family. But something was wrong. Father usually disappeared at night. He always took Thida with him. Did you eat yet? Yes, we ate. You boys are so smart. I don't needto keep telling you. Should I wake Thida up? Let her sleep. This room was his passion. The room was filled with photographic plates. They were taken by an old technique. Each glass photo was the only one in the worldand could not be replaced. This was his obsession. Mom, you're so pretty! So both of us can be pretty in our photo, right? Yes. Babe, am I beautiful yet? Yes. It's so pretty, isn't it? Yes. There is only one piece in the whole world. Wow, it's so pretty. Our happy moment didn't last long. No matter how much we tried we could not make a nice photograph again. Because of the chemicals, his hand was completely burned. One night Something even worse happened. That's so annoying! Where did it go? Mom! Are you okay? Go away! Since that day. My father the photographernever came home. At that time. The country was in chaos. When he dissappeared, no one noticed. After that, we were asked to leave the house. We had to look after ourselves. Everyone was struggling to survive. I have forgotten this taste for a long time. U Kyaw Zaww. He's hoping to get my love all the time. Well, I'm sorry. He's a weak boy. I won't love such a weak child like that. Are you Amay Gyan? Am I that pretty? Thank you. I'm the owner of this house. And everything in this house... is mine. What do you want? I want my daughter back, you idiot. Thida is with you! She lives with you now. Where are you hiding her? You don't know where she is? No! Don't joke around with me. I want you to leave now! No. If we don't get Siri back. We won't leave! Every child in this house belongs to me. I am their only mother. You're the ones who have to leave. You thief! Give me back my daughter! A thief like you can't be a mother. How dare you call me that! I'm not a thief! May, wake up! May! May! May! May. May. May. It's me. It's me, May. What happened? I have never seen anything like this before. Only the Nat can channel a Natgador body because we are connected. But I don't understand why my mother can possess May's body. This is unusual. Mother and May must have some kind of connection. May! May! Wake up! Get out! May! Give me back my daughter. Get out right now! Get out! Give me back my daughter! Give me back my daughter! Do you mean the girl... who stoleyour daughter's body? Or the poor girl that you left behind? May! May! May! Stay focused. May! What are you saying? What are you saying? That girl's in the dark. And she's crying all alone. She's so pitiful. And her mother is happy with someone else now. Every child in this house... is mine! And I... am their mother. I'm their only mother! You ungrateful son! May! May! May! Please save my life again. Siri. I will look for you and find you. And I'll bring you back. Mom. Thida? Yes, Mom. Can you help me find Siri? I will help you, Mom. Welcome to my house. Siri. Babe. Siri, babe. Babe. Thida. Do you know where Siri is? I don't know where she is. I looked all over the house already. Do you think she's still here? Yes. Because we can't leave this house. If we go outside we end up back at this house. Her spirit can't go far from her body. Thida! I know what you're doing. Thida! Siri... ...is very good at playing hide and seek. Where is the best hiding place here? I think I know where she is! She must be in Dad's dressing room. Really? Okay, let's see. - Let's see. - Okey. It's always locked though. I don't think she can hide in there. It's locked from the inside. Babe. Siri. Mom? Babe, are you inside? Babe. Siri. Babe. I'm here for you, babe. Babe. Let's go away from here. I'm here now, babe. You don't love me anymore. You never loved me. Babe, what are you saying? Babe. Dad is waiting for you. Let's go, sweetie. You don't love me, Mom. Babe. What are you saying. Please forgive me. Please, sweetie. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault, please forgive me. Sweetie. Open the door, babe. She's coming. We really have to hurry now. You can come out now, Siri. Babe. Please understand me, Siri. I couldn't see you. We were in two different worlds. Please understand Mom, my dear. You don't love me. You abandoned me. You only love Thida. You don't love me at all. That's not true. I love you the most, Siri. You don't care about me. I called you all the time. But you never looked at me. You are wrong, babe. I really couldn't see you, sweetie. We were in different worlds. Please come with Mom, sweetie. Come with Mom, babe. Babe. Let's go, babe. Come out. She told me you hate me. She told me you hate naughty children. Babe. Babe. Siri. Come out this once! Siri. You have to come back with me right now. Dad is waiting for you. No matter what, I am still your mother. You were born from my belly. You are alive... because you came from me. You should obey me. I don't want to stay here. Come with me now! Siri! Did you hear me? Babe. Mom. Oh my dear. Babe. Mom. Babe. Thida. What should Mom do next? We have to take a photo. Okay. Let's go. Why are you flying Golden Eagle? We didn't bring little sister. I can see her behind you. Her flesh is bitter. I'll wash her in the stream. The stream is dry in the summer. I'll wash her in the river. I am the master of this house. These are my children. Every child in this house belongs to me. I am their only mom. Do you understand? Do you? Huh? Mom. Dad. Hurry up. Siri, go sit over there. I'm coming. Hold the shutter release. And don't squeeze yet. Siri. Yes? I'm sorry. It's okay. Are you ready? I'm ready. I'm taking the photo. May! May! May! May! Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Who are you? Can't you recognise your own Mom? Sweetie. Sweetie. Sweetie. I found... You!

You're not my mom. Thida. I... I don't have a mother. What did you say? I only have Dad. I only love Dad. He's kind and takes care of me. I love him so much. I miss him so much. Help me. Help me. I don't have a mother. Only Dad. I don't know you. I don't want to know you either. I love Dad. I miss him so much. Help me. Don't get closer. Dad. Come back to us okay. Help me.

I'm leaving now. I want to be with you, Dad. I want to be with you too. But... my time is up. Why do you want to be a mom? I don't know. I couldn't control myself sometimes.
