And she goes to Saint Mary Francis SchooI... for rich little Catholic girls. These are her private thoughts. Ah ah ah. Ahh. Oh, man! It's her diary. I'm going to sleep now. All right. Unh. Unh. Good morning, BIanche. Lady from foster care was here. She wants to send Anthony... to training school for handicaps. Anthony ain't goin' to no school for cripples. He had polio. No big deal. He needs to learn how to make a living. He don't even speak good English. He's gonna have a mechanic shop. I'm saving up. He ain't got legs like you. So? He needs to be in a legitimate business. He can't run when the cops come. You're telling me I'm not in a legitimate business? It' s a thoroughIy professionaI operation... and it don't hurt nobody. Insurance companies pay. The cops don't know about it. Well, make sure it stays that way. I got clients. I can't have the cops snooping around here. You don't want us, we'll leave. You listen to me, Mr. Big For Your Britches. Your mother was like a sister to me. I held her hand when your father dumped her... for that rich bitch. And if it wasn't for me... the two of you would've gone to county when she died. So don't tell me I don't want you. I just want you to fly right is all. Anthony's driving me crazy with that engine. Can't you just buy one? No. Money can't buy what he's building. A be-bop baby A be-bop baby These girIs are training to be nuns. They are not. Hey, if you were rich, loved your daughter... didn't want her mixing with just any old jerk... where would you send her? She's safe in there. You know, you're gonna kill yourself... climbing over this thing. School gets out soon. A be-bop baby in her oId bIue jeans Is the be-bop baby for me Come on, guys. Let's get out of here. What do you see, Johnny? She's a skinny little girl in uniform. I wouldn't waste my time with her. You just don't see it. I see. She's rich and white. Oh, what's the matter with that? Nothing, except you're not a member... of her country club. Admit it... that's what you want... but don't fuck us to get that. Looks just like her daddy' s car. Come on, Johnny. Now, that's too dangerous. Four weeks, man. Now, we don't touch nothin' for four weeks. Now that's the deal. I can't go down there in this car, man. She wouldn't pay attention. Why not? This car' s got a V-8 heart. It may have that, but it's got the skin of a dinosaur. Now, the guy don't get off work till 5:00. I'll have it back by then. All right. You take my car... and you meet me at the flats. I'll be there in the Caddy with her, and we'll drag. You're gonna ruin a good thing. I'm gonna get a good thing. God, man, he's way out. Oh, yeah. He's gonna be way out in jail if he doesn't watch it. Not Johnny. Johnny's a charmed man. Hey, good-Iooking. Beautiful day like this... you girls ought to be out in the breeze. I'm Johnny Ramirez. What's that? Excuse me? What nationality? Catholic. Tell your friend to take your car home... and you come with me. Come on, Laura, we have other obligations. Come with me. You can do obligations anytime. Meet me at my house in an hour. Two. An hour and a half. Certain people aren't gonna be happy... about this, Laura, if you get my drift. Excuse me. Johnny. Laura. So who are certain people? People who always do what they're supposed to do. Let's go. How do you like this place? It's OK. I go here 'cause of my dad. Your dad? All my dad cares about... is keeping me in a perfect little box... with perfect clothes where I'm perfectly safe... and it's perfectly boring. Kinda like you're his little Cinderella? Yeah. Yeah. It's different for a guy. My father's rich, but he's a very smart man. He made me get out in the world, experience things. Ohh. So what do you do? I run one of his businesses. I'm gonna take you out to the dam. We go out there every afternoon to drag. What' s that? You know, drag race. Oh, OK. What a piece of shit! Oh, yeah, this is a real piece of shit... but at least it's paid for. Let's go! One! Two! Three! Be right back. OK. What happened, Doogie? I don't know. I hit something, I smelled fumes... You check the fuel pump. I don't want to get my hands dirty. Jesus. How' s it Iook up there? Pull that one for me, will ya? Hey! Hey, Pearl. You don't talk to me no more? Oh, I see. You've just gotten a little too fancy for me... all of the sudden with your new rich girlfriend, huh? Why do you want to fuck everything up for everybody? Talk to me, Johnny! We'll fix it tonight. '' Fix it tonight. '' What the fuck is that supposed to mean? That was the most fun I ever had. Yeah, you're a dragstrip girl now. How do you know where I live? I know a lot of things. Laura... where the hell have you been? Johnny gave me a ride home. For two damn hours? You, buddy, don't know your way around here too good... if it took you two hours to get back here. Just wanted to get acquainted. Get out of the car, Laura. I am getting out of the car. I don't know who you are... or where you come from... but it ain't here. Now, you're a stranger... and you keep it that way with my girl. You understand me? I figure that's up to her. Yeah, that is up to her... but you will deal with me. It'd be my pleasure. He is trash, Laura. I don't think so. He dresses like a hood. You ain't gettin' away with this, you know. With what? Dumping me like this, that's what. I'm not dumping you. We're just having some fun racing cars. Yeah. You know what your problem is? That you don't like being from where you're from. Yeah? And where's that? Poor people. We're poor and Mexican. Didn't you know that? This is a free country. Oh, and you really believe that? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, you know what? It's OK to go around and say that... but you start acting free... you're gonna get your ass handed to you. You don't need that. What you need is to be taken care of. Where are you going? Home. Johnny... you can't leave this here. It's hot. I gotta go. You can't leave this fucking car here! Hey, you don't have to tell Raoul nothin' about the car. You just tell him I brought it in. Don't let him tear it down for a few days, all right? Nothing about this girl is gonna change who you are. Don't you forget it. I like being with her, all right? People are always telling me... I can't do this, I can't do that! Fuck 'em! It's not like that with her. She makes me feel like I can be somebody who gets respect! She doesn't even know you! I do! And I love you for who you are. Yeah, I know that, but I'm not gonna be that person... for the rest of my life. She's gonna love me for what I can be! I know you got dreams, Johnny. We can do them together. No, it's not the same, Pearl. I'm sorry. I came outside to put the top up, and it was gone. Did you do anything unusual last night, Mr. Jones? No, no. Nothing special. My wife and I went to the Diplomat supper club... for dinner. And to the Starlight Grill for a nightcap... to celebrate our anniversary. Is that it? Yeah. So do you think you'll be able to find it? We'll check it out. Hi, Johnny. Doogie. This is Detective Dryden. How you doing, Johnny? Mind if I ask you a few questions? Not at all, detective. No problem. What do you use this for? Making keys. That's very funny. No, it' s not funny. I'm a businessman. I'm trying to make a living. Uh-huh. A man who came here to dinner the other night... had his car stolen. A red Cadillac convertible. Would you know anything about that? Stolen from here? No. Stolen later. Nope. Wouldn't know anything about it. Uh-huh. Well, you let me know if you hear of anything suspicious. Sure. No problem. No problem whatsoever. You're running out of luck. You wish. Fuck you, Doogie. Fuck you, Johnny. Look at that. It's around the corner. That guy pretended to be a hotshot, that's all. Turns out he's just a carhop. Looks like he may need a lesson in respect. Yeah. Yeah, I think everything's gonna be OK. Three against one, huh? Nah, just me. I see you around my girl again... you're gonna get a lot worse than this. Unh! Unh! Oh, no, what happened to you, Johnny? Her boyfriend don't approve. Don't worry. It's just a bloody nose. You know what? She's bored with him. How the hell do you know? I read, man. She's bored with him. Some men do certain things better than others. Oh, you do.
