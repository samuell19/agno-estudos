(bird screeches) (intense electronic music) (elbow thuds) (man groans) (guns firing) - [Masked Man] Now, listen up. Anyone move, anyone sneeze, anyone blink an eyelid, and this young lady here, what's your name, honey? - Dorothy. - [Masked Man] Dorothy here is gonna get her brains splattered all over her station. You'll be picking them out of these nooks and crannies for a week. Time, two minutes. - [Masked Woman] All right, one loaded. - [Masked Man] What did I just say? Tell him, Dorothy. - He'll splatter my brains all over the station. - [Masked Man] Now, how can you bear that on your conscious? One shot, mine. (gun blasts) (glass shatters) One minute. Now, ask yourself, did he do that on purpose or was his aim so bad maybe I could take a chance and rush him? While you're trying to figure that out you owe somebody an apology. - [Man] What? - [Masked Man] Come here, apologise to Dorothy. What's your name? - Fred. - [Masked Man] Go ahead, Fred. - I apologise. - [Masked Man] 30 seconds. She better accept or you're dead, Fred. - I accept. - [Masked Man] Good, then kiss and make up. Go on. 15 seconds. (bag thuds) We're outta here. Bye, bye, sweetie. (gun blasts) Anyone else wanna be a hero? (guns blasting) (upbeat electronic music) (sirens blaring) - I'm gonna take my break now, Mr. Muldick. - 15 minutes. Try not to come back smelling like weed. - Yes, sir. (upbeat electronic music) (tyres screech) (metal thuds) (skaters whooshing) (upbeat electronic music) (sirens blaring) (metal crunching) - [Police Radio] Unit 44. (upbeat electronic music) (bags thudding) - (laughs) Yeah! (tyres screech) - You see any rollerbladers come by? - Yeah, they went in the park. (sirens blaring) (tyres screech) (starter pistol fires) (crowd cheering) - Very good, Frank. - Goodbye, 89. - So long, 21. (door slams) - We did it, Slim, we really did it. I'm telling you that beat everything, even sex. What's the matter? - I can taste the other guy on your lips. - Yeah, me too. What was I thinking? Hey, shoot me now, Jesus. What's wrong? - There's a cop car tailing us. - Oh shit. - Are you gonna give yourself up, Tonto? See that blonde? Stick close, let me do the talking. You wanna take another nine trips? Or you want to divide that by three? - Just what I need, a mathematician. Okay, but I'm a cheap tipper. All right, load me up. - Can you make it to the door? - [Cops] Seen any rollerbladers come by? - [Woman] Why, what'd they do? - Robbed a bank five blocks away. Two young guys and a girl. Could have been these two. - Shit, we missed all the fun. - [Cop] What've you got in that case? - Rollerblades. - Open it up. - You're selling insurance? - You'd be surprised how many people think they're fully covered and they aren't. Let's just say you got injured in the line of duty, what do you think? The city's gonna take care of all your expenses? Think again. Right here's a policy that's ironclad. Maybe I can drop by the house one evening explain it to you if you're interested. - [Cop] Forget it. (door slams) - One day, Slim, you're gonna push it too far. - There's no such think as too far. - You always treat the law that way? - I would have given him the money if he would've just said please and thank you. What are you doing Friday? - Still moving in, why? You wanna help? (laughs) - She's cute. Maybe the three of us can have some fun sometime. - (laughs) This is so fucking sweet, man. Still can't believe how easy it was. It was just like you said. - It is kind of amazing when you think about it. - So don't think about it. Just do it. - Yo, yo, look, we're on, we're on. - And escaped with over $300,000 in cash. Detective Jake Macgruder, leading the hunt, told us this. - We're chasing up a number of clues found at the crime scene. I'm confident we'll be announce arrests very shortly. - That's what I like about this guy, he isn't afraid to dig his own grave and jump right in. - So, what's next, man? - Next? - Yeah, don't tell me that was the beginning and end of our careers. - [Frank] No way. - There's 50 grand each. - So, what's that for? It looks like a hundred grand plus change. - That's our stake money. For the next job. - That's what I'm talking about, baby. - Today was just our calling card. - Let 'em know we're serious. - So, how about a little bit more action next time? - What, something hotter? - Help keep your mind off that blonde. - Was she a blonde? I don't remember. (Frank laughs) I do have another job in mind. - [Otis] And what's that? - Before I tell you, I'll have to remind you of the ground rules. - You and your rules. - They're for our protection. Because they mean the difference between a sentence of 10 to 25, and a life of liberty, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. - These are the best shots we got. 300,000 of mixed, unmarked bills. We got no leads. And judging by these... Hey! Focus here. (cops hooting) Can I help you, honey? - Maybe, I don't know yet. - Well, the little girl's room is down the hall. - Do I have to ask you every time I wanna go? - Jake, but you may call me Lieutenant Macgruder. And what's your name, sweetie. - Detective Karen Svenson, on assignment. They said you were a little understaffed. - Well, we may be undermanned, perhaps you'd like to sit and watch how we men catch perps in this squad. - If it's all the same to you, I'd like to catch them myself. But you can sit and watch if you like. - Cute. But hide the knees, 'cause in that tight, little dress you're giving me one hell of a hard on. (squad laughs) So, the only thing we know about these guys is they're under 30, they got ice water in their veins, and they can skate like hell. So, get out there and find them. And keep it tight. I don't want anyone blabbing to the press. - Since we don't know anything that shouldn't be hard. - They're good, they're dangerous, and I want 'em. (water splashes) (smooth electronic music) (Alex coughing) - Goddammit, fuck you, Slim, fuck you! - Look, you're in this here with your friends looking after you, it should be easy to handle, Alex. It's gonna be different on the day. - Yeah, there'll be cops trying to kill us. - Is that all that's bothering you? (bicycle wheels whirring) (door rattles) Always be polite. Remember to say please and thank you, and never call each other by name. - And if they don't cooperate, shoot them? - Don't worry, they'll cooperate. You know what this is? - Nine mil? - You're a smart ass. (gun clicks) - Think again. - Now, be a good ole boy and get into the truck, please. (tyres screech) Straight at the lights. Don't slow down. - The light's red. (gun blasts) (glass shatters) (Alex screams) (laughs) - We got a 317, Unit 54, West Nile and 22nd. We've been hijacked. - [Dispatcher] Copy that, Unit 54. - Who's in the back? - Eddie. - Hey, Eddie, how are you? Eddie. Eddie! (hand banging) Listening? - Yes, yes I am, sir. - Okay, look out the back. You see a guy in a convertible? Yes, yes, I do, sir. - Okay, open the back of the truck and throw the money out to him, now. - I'm sorry, I can't do that, sir. - Look, I'm counting to 10 and then I'm gonna have to shoot one of your pals. Which one you want it to be? The one with the big nose, or the one with the fat ass? (Alex laughs) No offence. (sirens blaring) - You hear that siren? - Just keep your eyes on the road. - These trucks ain't so easy to hijack, we're in permanent radio contact. Your plan just went up in smoke, so why don't you just give yourselves up? (sirens blaring) (horn honks) (tyres screech) (dramatic electronic music) - Come on, can't you get anymore juice outta this heap? - You know the penalty for speeding? - How good at you at jumping? - Jumping? - Yeah. Out of a moving car. - No, no! (sirens blaring) (tyres screech) (woman squeals) (dog yelps) (Slim hoots) - Come on, baby, come on. (dramatic electronic music) - Cover those on ramps and get a chopper standing by. We're gonna swarm 'em. - What about the hostages? (helicopter whirring) - You, inside the truck. Down there, you, you hear me? Pull over. - Hey, Eddie, you in contact with the bird out there? - [Eddie] Yes, sir. - [Jake] You hear me? - Tell that son of a bitch to back off before we start firing. - They're gonna start firing. - You're gonna start firing at me? Are you? All units, close in. (sirens blaring) (upbeat music) (horn honks) (cars thud) (glass shatters) (sirens blaring) (rotors whirring) (tyres screeching) This turkey's ripe. (upbeat rock music) (gate rattles) (helicopter whirring) (tyres screech) - You're trapped, you're trapped! (tyres screeching) (helicopter rumbles) - You in the truck, listen up, we're gonna do this nice and slow. One, throw the weapons out. Two, step out of the truck with your hands on your head. Three, you've got 30 seconds. - Make it easy on yourself, just do what the man says. - I don't think so. - What the hell are you doing? - Plan A didn't work out. This is plan B. (upbeat music) (water splashes) (footsteps pounding) - Oh yeah, that'll work. (water rushing) - What the hell they do that for? - Yeah, this is Jake, put me through. It was planned. The rest was a distraction. (water splashes) Get him outta there! (boat rumbles) Tom, sanction this, I want some divers, I want a crane. And I wanna know why they're wearing life jackets. (guard grunting) (upbeat music) - Hey, can I get my fingers back, please? Supposed to climb up not down. - [Karen] Isn't that a little conventional? - Keep carrying on that way, lady, and you're gonna make enemies. And some friends maybe, Jesus. Oh, it's you. - How are those fingers feeling? - Why, you wanna test them? - You any good? (Slim laughs) I meant a race. Meet you at the bottom. - Yeah. - What kept you? - (laughs) Ready for another one? - I'd love to race now, but I can't. I gotta go talk to my friend. - Another time. - Sure, another time. Right here. - What's she doing here? - Why, you jealous? - If I was jealous, she'd be getting stitches. - What's that behind your ear? Is that seaweed? - What? (laughs) Funny. - So what's your count? - One million, one hundred thousand and change. You? - 1.5 million. That totals 2.6, split four ways that's 650 grand each. Nope, not enough to retire on. - You may wish to retract that. - Where'd you get this? - Found it wedged in one of my bags. - It's a bearer bond. One million dollars. - Yeah, and it's got 19 little brothers and sisters drying out in my kitchen. - That's 20 million dollars. - Yes. - We hit the fucking jackpot. Bingo, baby. - Okay, yeah, but you can't just walk into a bank and cash these. Gonna have to find a broker. - I know a guy who can do it. We're not gonna get more than 50 cents on the dollar. We also risk exposure. But we're not doing that without Frank and Otis' say so. - Look, Frank's not gonna say no to another two and a half million, and I don't think Otis is gonna pass on it either. - That's what I like, team spirit. - Mm-hmm. (suspenseful music) - If thine eye offend thee he'll pluck it out and cast it from thee. And what better for thee to enter this life with one eye rather than have two eyes to be cast into hell fire. Now, what do you think the good book means by that? Huh, huh? Sally? - If your friend got a sore eye, you gotta poke it out with a sharp stick. - Ooh! Well, the way I read it is, the bible is trying to tell you if you got some kind of weakness, if you got some kind of weakness, you better overcome it. Like, if you've got some craving for some of your mom's apple pie that's sitting and cooling on the windowsill, and then your ma come out she says, hey, you better leave that 'til suppertime, then you better leave it be else your immortal soul's gonna burn in the everlasting fires of hell. Okay. (kids screaming) (kids chattering) Somebody hit a bank truck carrying bonds belonging to your people? - That's right. - And you can't claim on the insurance? - Nobody was supposed to know they was there. And my people ain't the type to carry insurance. Besides, bank's trucks are supposed to be reliable. - And these things can be cashed at any time? - Either they don't know what they've got or how lucky they've been, and before they realise the boss wants you to figure a way to change their luck. (kids chattering) - Do you know how much a new roof's gonna cost me? - 20, 30 grand? - You're not even close. - We'll pay up to 100 Gs. - Plus expenses. - What kind of expenses? (preacher laughs) - Hey, this better be important, I got a conference call in 10 minutes so take five. What do you got? - Bearer bonds for 20 million. - You're shitting me. - That's number one, I got another 19 more just like it. - This is just a photocopy. - You don't expect me to walk into a brokerage firm with the original, do you? This place is full of thieves. - I won't get more than 60 cents on the dollar. - How soon? - Two days, three at the most. - I'll be in touch. (car rumbles) Okay, we got two million, 600 thousand dollars. It's gonna swell by another 10 million in a week or so if everything goes to plan. - I think I'm gonna get rid of the old microbus. - No. The most common cause for getting caught is the person can't wait to start spending what he hasn't earned. Keep a low profile. That way you serve one year now, you don't have to serve 20 later. - Right, right. - When I get at price on the bonds I'll let you know. Until then, we don't know each other. - Cool. Hey, you okay, Alex? - Of course I am. (engine revs) (club thuds) (Slim grunts) (water splashing) (Slim grunting) (chains rattling) - [Man] Good afternoon. You guys are smart. But understand this, there's always somebody smarter, and always someone ready to point the finger if the price is right. Now, listen up, the air around you is minus 20 degrees. You're young, you're strong, so I give you about 10 minutes before the ice starts to bite. 10 minutes after that I could snap off your nipples and put them in my coffee for sweetener. Now that I have your undivided attention I'll give you my proposal. Those two raids netted you around two, two and half million tops. You worked for that money so I reckon you have the right to keep it. But it's chump change compared to what I've got lined up for your next job. Now, there's a delivery of high denomination, used banknotes, big numbers headed for destruction. You're gonna get it for me before it goes up in flames. And maybe you want time to discuss it between you. - What's the alternative? - [Man] The alternative is that Monday morning someone'll be promoting a whole new range of ice flavours. I'm sending someone to help you, and watch out for my interests. He'll be at your place tonight. Don't try skipping out. I found you once, I can find you again. You get any ideas, your names, photographs, addresses go directly to the police. I'm taking your silence to mean you agree. (Slim thuds) (key clinks) - I don't give a fuck what the man said, I'm out! Give me my cut of the money, man. - Otis, take a look outside. They've been there since we got back. They're watching us. You all right? - Yeah, fine. - So, got any ideas? You got us into this, how're you gonna get us out? - We all knew what we were doing. What are you saying, you want out? - I'm saying I'm not doing anyone else's dirty work for free. - We go along with the deal for now, otherwise we go directly to jail. - Man, we are walking a tightrope in the dark. I'm with Otis, we take what we go, we disappear. - You leave now and you won't have to wait for them to find you, I'll kill you myself. - Y'all cut that out. Acting like a married couple and shit. Terrible. Y'all stop screwing or what? (loud knocking) He's here. So, we gonna let him in or are you two gonna do they job for him? - You do that again, and I'll smudge my lipstick. - Just try and relax, okay? We'll find a way out of this. - Expecting me? - Yeah, we were expecting you. (door creaks) We don't know who you are or who sent you. - Call me Jerry. And the man who sent me, well, you know his name already, right? He's the man who sent me. - You got jokes. - You're Otis. I can guess that. You're Seth Savernick, known as Slim. Alex. Where's the fourth one? (door creaks) Hey, Frank. I'm Jerry. (laughs) You don't wanna stand there shivering, you'll catch your death of cold. (laughs) Did I interrupt some sort of disagreement? - No. - I never done a job with an Afro-American before. Harvard here, they say some niggers can hold down a job. So, I don't mind a nigger being on the team if he's gonna carry my bags. Yeah, well, we'll go over your plan tomorrow. I'm happy for you boys to run the show. The only thing I'm gonna insist on is the drop off point. And remember, you'll think of me as part of the team. - And what you gonna do as part of the team? - I'm gonna see that none of the money gets stuck to your sticky fingers. 'Cause if it do, I'm gonna shoot off your sweet, black ass. - How ya doing? - Hello, can I help you? - Yeah, I'd like a 407 SP2 digital camcorder with the infrared mode switch. The 407 SP2. - Oh, yeah. - Can I get the black one? (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) All right, so we head out here and the car will be waiting. - What about traffic? - They're still working on that lane over there that means this side'll be clear. - Yeah, we're a thousand feet up here, nowhere to go. That car better be waiting. I don't wanna be sitting here with my dick in my hand when the cops show up. - It'll be here. Don't worry. (rope whizzes) - Thought we agreed no ropes. - Oh, okay. No ropes. You ready? - Three, two, one. No, wait. - Now what? - Chalk. - Ready now? Shit. (upbeat music) (Karen grunts) Take my hand. Take it. (Karen grunts) - Sucker. (upbeat music) (metal jingles) What kept you? - You're using my lines now? (slow electronic music) (rapid knocking) - [Frank] Hey. - So, what'd you call me for? Geez, Frank, you ever clean up this mess? - What for? I'm not gonna be here after tomorrow. Maybe none of us are. - What's that supposed to mean? - I got a bad feeling. - Look, relax, get an early night. I know it ain't easy. - You gotta make it up with Slim. - Mm-mm. Never gonna happen. Look, when this is over I'm taking my share and I'm out. - You two have been fighting like wildcats since this thing started. - Wow, really? I didn't think it showed. I was a bad girl. - Big mistake, Alex. - Wow, Frank, you're smarter than you look. - Listen, you two better sort this out between you, otherwise something bad is gonna happen. All right? - Yeah, like what? - I'm gonna die tomorrow. I feel it. - Look, you didn't tell anyone else what we were doing tomorrow. - [Frank] Of course not. - So, what's the problem? You're not gonna die, Frank. Okay? - [Slim] Hey, I gotta get going. - Come on. Anything that good should be experienced more than once. - You've convinced me. - That's what I like about you, impulsive. - No, not me. All I do is assess risks. Good risks and bad risks. That's insurance for you. - So what are you? Good risk or a bad risk? - What do you think? - Bad. Real bad. - So, what's your name, anyway? - Karen. - Well, Karen, there's just one more thing I wanna know about you. - What's that? - Which side do you sleep on? (breathes heavily) (phone rings) - Yeah? Yeah, I'm listening. I got people on the street checking the brokerage houses. If they want those bonds traded, they're just gonna have to come out of the woodwork. Now, I'm working on it. (water splashes) Relax. - I can't breathe, you bastard! Fuck-- - Hey, hey, honey, hey. Now, let's say I'd give you another $50 and I baptise you all over again. (gun clicks) - Did I fail to give satisfaction? - You did just fine. - What's the piece for? - [Karen] Work. - What kind of work requires you to use an automatic? - Police work. - Oh. Well, Karen, I've never been fucked by a policewoman before. - Not fucked, seduced. And I'm a detective. - Detective. I'm impressed. - Well, I know you have a problem with authority, cops in particular. - So, you shoot guns? - Yeah. - You like the work? - [Karen] You wanna know what really turns me on? - What's that? - It's the look in the perps eye when he realises I'm bringing him down. Especially when he was thinking he got away scot-free. Think that's weird? (truck rumbling) - Yeah! (heavy percussive music) We're rolling, baby. - Showtime! (horn honks) (tyres screech) - [Jerry] Hey. - You know the deal. You're here as an observer. You pay attention to the clock. Do not engage in gun play unless it's strictly necessary. Do not depart from the plan in any way. - Yeah, whatever you say. One thing I wanna know, this plan change any if you're dead?

(gun fires) (smooth electronic music) - Told ya. (gun blasts) (fist thuds) - What the fuck did I tell you? I said no shooting. We never kill anyone. What did I say? - You oughta take care of your friend. - Alex. What happened? - I'll make it, it's okay. (gun clicks) - Can't hang around all day. - I've had just about enough of your shit. - If you shoot me, you're gonna have to answer to the man. (Jerry thuds) - You're gonna make it, baby. We're moving out, now! (smooth electronic music) (sirens blaring) - What's going on? - I don't know. Chemical spill? - We got a major accident here, possible hazardous chemical spill. Alert all units, over. (radio squeals) Do you copy? - Hang on, baby. Hang on. (Alex huffing) - Where's the car? - [Slim] What car? - The fucking escape car? - I forgot to tell you, we changed the getaway. I'm sorry.

(smooth electronic music) (chute whooshes) (smooth electronic music) (chute whooshes) - You fucked me! - You're catching on fast, scumbag. (uptempo electronic music) - Floor it, straight through.

(Alex groans) - Easy. - Leave me, I can't make it. - Yes, you can. Look at me, Alex. You're gonna make it. Look at me, look at me. Okay, we're going up slowly. Come on. You're gonna make it, baby. Up, nice and easy. (Alex groans) Hold on, baby. - Oh shit. - Just hold on, okay? All right? Hold on. I gotta get her to a hospital, now. - No hospital, Jesus. - Okay, easy, easy. Just stay with me. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine. - Okay. - Alex? Alex? Alex, hold on! Alex! Alex? Oh fuck. Alex! Fuck! This wasn't supposed to happen. Oh, fuck. (dramatic music) - She's gone. What now? - Get the money. - We're not giving them the money. Not like this. - You want them chasing us the rest of our lives? We're giving them the money. (melancholy music) (bags thudding) - You gotta get out of those clothes. Slim. Clean yourself up. Should've kept the money, man. - Then we'd never get off the hook. - Alex is dead because of that asshole and we leave it at that? - Trust me, we ain't gonna leave it at that. We have to stay clean until we sell those bonds. Then we get the payback. I'll take care of her, man. (phone ringing) I'll get that. It's for you. It's the man. (phone beeps) - Yeah, speak to me. - [Man] Oh, I will. - Did you receive the cargo? - [Man] Yeah. I have to tell you we got a serious problem. Did you check those money bags? - [Slim] Well, we didn't exactly have time for that. - They were suppose to contain large bills for destruction, non-registered, non-traceable. - [Slim] So what are you telling me, they didn't? - Uh-huh, just paperwork. Federal bank paperwork. - Yeah, well, that's tough luck for you, isn't it? - You don't get it. You gotta go again, son. - [Slim] No, that wasn't part of the deal. - It is now. - Look, we already lost one life. We're not going again. Are you fucking hearing me? - Yeah, now you listen, and you listen good, you're gonna go again, and again, until I get what I want. - Or until we're all dead, right? - Tough luck, ain't it? What ever happened to Jerry? Radio says man his description was engaged in gunfire with the police. - That's the kind of guy he was. Never one to draw attention. - How're you gonna manage now? What's important is you won't let me down. (phone beeps) - You know what to do, Otis. - Yeah. - Fuck, this is not gonna end! - Look, my broker should have a deal in the next couple of days. We just gotta hold on 'til then. (tyres screech) - You the one wanting to make a trade? - Yeah, that's right. - You got those bonds? - Got a copy. - Let me take a look. Yeah, serial numbers seem to check. Now, let us see the genuine article. - Well, I can get them, if the price is right. - You say you got about 20 of these? - Yeah. - Now, who did you get them from? - I can't tell you that. I gotta protect my sources. - Damn complicated knife. Even got an attachment here for skinning a rabbit. You ever seen a rabbit skinned, boy? - This was taken from the CCTV on the bridge. That's one sick puppy. - You see anyone try to stop them? This was calculated execution. Rewind the tape. Okay, let it play. (suspenseful music) You didn't get a look at any of them? - No, I didn't. - These guys will strike again. Next time we're gonna be there. - In a downtown parking garage where police are investigating a brutal murder. - Slim, take a look at this. - It appears to be Roy Hamilton. The body was found in a parking lot near his place of work. The vicious nature of the crime have police baffled. - Fuck! Roy couldn't have kep this mouth shut for more than three seconds. We gotta get outta here. (light knocking) - That'll be Otis. - Frank, don't answer the door. Frank! - Slim Savernick? - Never heard of him. - Let me check my description here. Medium build, slim, blonde hair, looks dyed. Better be careful, makes your hair fall out. (door slams) Involved in a number of heists. You following me? - Nah, you lose me on the turns. - Who's your door opener? That your butler? - That's a friend, he was just leaving. - No, not 'til I say so. What's your name, punk? - Frank. - [Preacher] And who's Otis? - Who? - He said, "That'll be Otis" when you come to the door. So, I reckon you're expecting an Otis. Unless you think my name is Otis, which it ain't. - Do you want something? - Cold beer would be nice. But I'd prefer 20 million dollars in bearer bonds. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - You have no idea, huh? Well, am I speaking a foreign language, or is it your memory that needs fixing? - Man, ain't nothing wrong with our brains a couple of jars of good old swamp water won't fix. - You're a sassy little varmint, ain't ya? You gonna hand over those bonds? - The man already told you he don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Okay, well, now, let's play a little guessing game. The first guess is how high Frank bounces off concrete. (Frank grunts) (glass shatters) (water splashes) Oh, I had no idea there was a pool down there. And the second guess is, where you keep them bonds stashed? Now, what puzzles me is how you kids can do a heist like that and the police don't find ya, when all I gotta do is keep my ears open and follow my nose. Hey, Otis, that you? - Fuck. - Why don't you just come in and join the party? Now, why don't you just sit down with our friend, Slim, here? Frank had to drop out. - What's going on? - Well, the people you fucked with, they want their bonds back. - Look, okay, we got the weekend coming up. I put them in a safety deposit box. - You put bearer bonds in a bank? Shit! Don't you know that banks get robbed? - Come back on Monday and I'll have them for you. - [Preacher] Just like that? - Yeah. Next time you might choose the other window. You know, they didn't have the foresight to build a pool over that one. - Oh, do I look stupid to you? I ain't letting you out of my sight. - Look, I know you got people watching us. What'll it take to get you off our backs 'til Monday? How does 10 grand sound? - Ooh! Well, it's a start. Now, you give me a call, when you've got the bonds. You run out on me, and I'll know where to find you. - Man, you crazy? Why you gotta be showing him all that money like that? He ain't gonna let us up until he squeeze us dry. - Yeah, don't worry about that. Did you find it? - Yeah, right where you put it. (phone rings) - Hello. - [Jake] You got a pen? - Go ahead. - We got a delivery, Monday morning, 10 o'clock, outside downtown SDLM Bank. - [Slim] How much? - Ooh, enough to get you out of the hot seat, sweet cheeks. You hit them in front when they're unloading. - Do I have a choice? - Sure you got a choice. You can do the hit and get me my money, or you can spend the rest of your days in a federal penitentiary. Take your pick. (phone beeps) Monday, 10 a.m. (door thuds) - Where's that asshole? I'm gonna fucking kill him. - Frank, he already left. Calm down. Let's find out who the other asshole is that's been pulling our strings. (tape whirring) You recognise him? - Macgruder. - You're telling me that it's the fucking police? - Even that prick figured it out. He said, "How come the police can't find you "when all I gotta do is keep my ears open "and follow my nose." - The fucking police! - We didn't get government paperwork on that last haul. We got hard cash. And now someone wants to retire on a hell of a lot more than a cop's pension. - Not before he goes out in a blaze of glory. He's setting us up. - If we don't go along with him, he'll arrest us anyway. It's Friday, we got the weekend. - [Frank] And then what? - I don't know. (tyres screech) You wanna have a drink with me? - You've got nerve. - Is that a yes? - There's a place across the road. - What, cop bar? - Too rich for you? - Try me. - Thank you. So why are you following me? - I just wanted to see you again. - Feeling comfortable? - Sure, why? - 'Cause your day job and their day job brings you into conflict. - Like I said I'm in insurance. - Insurance is just another form of risk taking and that's what you're into. Taking risks. Smart guy would've left town. Not you. You wanna sit chatting in cop's hangout because it turns you on. - You think so? - They've got tape showing a man with an A tattooed on the back of his neck carrying out robbery in which three security guards were killed in cold blood. What did you think I was doing rock climbing? Found someone who fits the profile. - There must be a hundred guys with tattoos on the back of their necks. - If they were all lined up, you think you wouldn't be picked out? - Mistaken identity. It's all circumstantial. - If I can pin this on you I am taking you down. I won't like it, but I'll do it without a second's hesitation. - You wanna make an arrest? You should try looking closer to home. - Meaning what? - Try taking your suspicions to your superiors. See what happens. - What happens is there'll be an investigation directed at you. - Maybe you'll get a promotion. - That's the general idea. - I think we look good together. - I'll get you. I won't give up. - Neither will I. (traffic whooshing) (Slim grunts) - Sometimes I think I'm getting too old for this job. - You said you'd give me the weekend. - Yeah, but 10 grand don't go as far as it used to. Anyway, what's 10 grand to a man of your means, just chicken feed. - You wanna ease up on the fucking belt? - Hey, whatcha doing checking out a bank on a Sunday when you should be in church? I got it, you're gonna make another hit. Say, I got a proposition. When you go pick up those bonds tomorrow how 'bout you fetch a little something for me? - What do you got in mind? - Five mil. - That'd be digging into my partners' share. - You mean Otis and that long, thin streak of piss, Frank? If it wasn't for them you'd be a rich man by now. Don't tell me that thought never occurred to you. - It never occurred to me to kill them, no. - When's one of them gonna do something real foolish and bring in the cops straight to you? If you ask me the only safe play for you if they both were dead. Well, I gotta be getting on my horse. Okay, gonna give you 'til nightfall to tell me where we're gonna meet tomorrow morning. Hey, man, I'm on a roll. - Fuck! (rapid knocking) - Come in. - Lieutenant, can I speak to you? - [Jake] Hey, honey, what's on your mind? - I believe I know one of the gang. - Yeah, so? How come you never mentioned this before? - I wanted to be sure first. - So what happened? He come right out and confess? Don't you know there's always a dozen jerks ready to take credit for a heist like that? Helps them pick up lonely women who ought to know better. - I got a positive ID on the surveillance tape and I have his fingerprints. - Fingerprints? - If you don't wanna listen to me I will find someone else who will. - Okay, okay, now hang on. What's his name? - Calls himself Slim. - That it? That's the only name? - Savernick, Slim Savernick. - Okay, I'll look into it. So, what's this guy to you? - Nothing. It's my collar that's all. - Ambitious little vixen, aren't you? - I've got another theory. They've got a man on the force. That's why they're so good, they're getting inside information. - I gotta tell you, sweetie, next time you come up with one of your cockamamie theories keep it to yourself until you get some proof I can use. (upbeat reggae music) - [Guard] Hey, who are you? - Fitzroy. - [Guard] Where's Valentina? - She's sick with the flu so I'm a replacement for the evening. - [Guard] Not without security clearance. - Look here, man, I get paid whether I do the job or not, sayin'? So if you want, y'all chief can come here in the morning, and find his office all mushed up the same way he leave it, it don't make no difference to me, me priority. How 'bout this? I'm gonna leave me bucket right there, and you can go and clean the place when you're ready. Okay. - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Harry. You got time to supervise this cleaner? - Yeah, that's all I'm here for, supervise cleaners. - Hey, don't do that. Okay, don't you do that. Don't you insult me this evening. I will not tolerate the impertinence. I don't just clean, I's what them call certified hygiene technician. You get that? Means that I follow a system, okay? First, I clean the empty half is them. Second, I clean the corridor there, and third, I clean toilet. You get it? Very systematic. So, don't insult me again. Who's office this? - Lieutenant Macgruder. - Well I make sure not to trouble his things. (speaking in a foreign language) Unlock the door, brother. You an idiot? What, you thinks me can squeeze through this little keyhole there, sir? Is that what you think? You're not thinking right, and youse what them call police officer. You have to be handy bar, man. Jah! So, yeah, let's keep the vacuum. (vacuum whooshing) - [Guard] Hey, where are you going? - You don't really expect me for do my work without Mr. Clean, do you? - You like? (woman whimpers) - You got the bags? (Frank coughs) All right, let's get out of here. Let's go. (woman whimpers) Valentina, you can relax, I did you work for you. (Valentine whimpers loudly) Hey, look, I said relax, now. You in the back of a van with two good looking young bucks. What more you want? Jesus, so damned ungrateful. We'll take you back tomorrow. Maybe. (laughs) (Valentina whimpers) - I have information that the gang will attempt to hit the Protect delivery truck outside downtown SDLM bank around 10 o'clock. I want all men in plain clothes, in the bank, in the streets, everywhere. SWAT team's taking up position as we speak. We got 40 minutes. - Lieutenant. Lieutenant Macgruder. - Better be quick, Earl. - New guy comes in to clean the station last night, disappear after 15 minutes. You haven't found anything missing, have you, sir? - Wait there. (drawers slamming) Okay here. - Maybe you should check your locker. Everything there? - [Jake] Yup, everything there. - Maybe it was okay. - I guess so. (light knocking) Come in. - Lieutenant, traffic's heavy downtown, we gotta go. - Get any resistance, any, you don't put yourselves at risk. - [Otis] Where's Frank? - He's gone ahead. (rifles clicking) - Hey, Jake, this is Sergeant Garret. - Sergeant. - How you doing? - Sergeant's got men overlooking both sides of the square, snipers on the roof. We got people in the bank and in the square. You see those two down there on the park bench? That's officers Leslie and Grunberg. - Okay, heads up. Target's on its way following the truck. - Sierra One, Sierra Two, suspects on their way. - Any resistance, shoot to kill. I thought I made it clear this is my operation. - The collar is mine and I can do it without killing anybody. - Well, I'm not prepared to take that chance. Stay out of it. - [Slim] You put the cash back in Macgruder's locker? - What you think? You're a little jumpy, man. - I just want it to me over, that's all. (dramatic music) - Jake, there's the Protect truck now. - It's suppertime. (dramatic music) (guns clicking) (door slams) Here we go, move in! (dramatic music) - Get down. Don't move. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. - Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - [Jake] Get him up. Where? - What's up, doc? (dramatic music) - Where are they? (hippie laughs) - Sir, this guy's alone. - Really? You think? Pandelis. (dramatic music) - [Slim] Yo! (flares popping) (patrons scream) (Frank hollers) - Yeah! (smoke bombs popping) - Pandelis. Sir, they struck. Sunfed Bank. - Sunfed? That's way over on the other side of town. - I know. (dramatic music) - Yeah. (guns blasting) (dramatic music) - They turned onto Western Avenue. - So, let's get there already. - You've got all units tied up here, Jake. - Come on. (Frank hooting) - We fucking did it! Yeah, baby! (Frank yelling) (tyres screech) (horns honk) (tyres screeching) (sirens blaring) - Oh, baby, come on, Slim, you know what to do. Let's go, hyperdrive.

Anyone following? - No, we're in the clear. Why're you slowing down? - It's time to say goodbye. - [Radio] We're getting reports of a raid on the federal bank in the last few minutes. The raid has taken police, who were staking out downtown SDLM Bank, by surprise. - Thanks. We got a fix on the van. Heading for the Bay parking lot. We got car coming from north and south, there's no way out. - You made me get my boots all wet and muddy. Where are your friends? - Take a look. - You don't mind if I double check. (gun blasts) - I usually go for a headshot myself. - Well, they're dead enough to me. Got my money? - Yeah, and your bonds. Get in.

Except for these few notes. - [Reporter] Was the explosion accidental? - These criminals killed themselves rather than face the consequences of their heinous crimes. - Heinous crimes, that's good. - You'll cut that last bit. - Svenson, messenger left this for you. (woman speaking in a foreign language) - [Karen] Sergeant, when did this come in? - [Sergeant] Two hours ago. - Before Lieutenant Macgruder cornered the heisters. - [Sergeant] Yeah. (papers rustling) - Now, Tom, before you even start, I did all I could to take them alive. - Open your locker. - Excuse me? - Detective Sergeant Svenson believes you're in possession of material connecting you to the heists. - Oh, I get it. You still sore at me? - Open your goddamn locker. - Surely. When I do I'll expect a personal apology. Satisfied. - Well down, Svenson. Consider yourself under arrest. - You can't think for one second I had anything to do with this. Tom. - Have a good flight, sir. - Thank you. - [PA Announcer] Flight 160. Boarding gate three. - It's all set, baby. - Beautiful. (laughs) - Ready? - Let's go. (gun fires) That was your last bullet. - [Preacher] Hey, where are you going? - You don't really expect me to sit around and wait for the cops now, do you? (metal clanging) Neat, huh? Frank and Otis got out the same way. - Frank and Otis? Who the hell are they? - Cops are looking for three bodies. They're gonna find them. Hey, Jerry, give him a smile. Here's your downpayment. See you in hell. (tyres screech) - Shit. (van booms) (tyres screech) - Hey, lady, you want a ticket? - Yeah, make my day. - Has your flight to Rio left yet? - They're making final boarding calls not, Gate 23.
