You're in the wrong place, man. This is our film. Calm down. -Calm down. We are sorry. -Yes, dear audience, we are sorry. Hey! Scram. USED CAR SALES SPECIALIST Peace be upon you, sir. May I help you? Sure. How many owners has this car had? Just one, sir. Since 1999. The previous owner was a woman. Woman? You know how women take care of their cars. Would you like a test drive? I think the car is not suitable for a man of your position. You need a bigger and more comfortable car. I suggest buying this car. Come. This is your dream car. You would look more stylish. But this car… What, sir? You ordered this car last week. You already paid the deposit. You even said you were going to settle the rest today, in cash. What's wrong, sir? Didn't you bring any cash? Sure, I did. Every day, I carry thousands of ringgits in my pocket. So, you're taking this car, right? Let's go to the office and sign the agreement. Honey, I've already bought the car for you. Really, darling? Come. You drive. -Sir. -Huh? -Come with me, sir. -To go where? -To my office. -What for? To sign the contract. You're buying this car, aren't you? Are you out of your mind? I don't have the money to buy this car. Then what are you doing here? How much will you pay for my car? -What happened to the car? -Honey. So, did you get us a new car? I've just been promoted, so I want to get a bigger car. What can you recommend? I think… You should buy a lorry. This car fits your budget. The body is nice, -and the engine is good. -What is the capacity? I think it can fit three times your family. It's so spacious, honey. Now, we're going to enjoy our trip to Cherating. Zali, are you comfortable back there? I'm going inside to pay. Fill the tank to the brim. Take whatever you want. Pump number eight. Full tank. This is 50 ringgit. Don't you have change? No. Sorry, we don't have change. Can you wait? How long? I'll ask my friend to withdraw some money. -Or you can buy some other things. -Never mind. Dad, pay. I'm sorry, sir. Can you wait a bit? I hate this. -How much does she owe you? -5.50. You got some more. Tell her to open her own shop and stop making trouble for others. Let me pay for you. It's all right, sir. If I don't do this, you would… I would what? You... would have lots of problems. -I'll try to look for change. -It's not necessary. Let me pay for you. It's not that much. I don't know what to say. I'm Linda. I'm Azlee. Ma'am. Thank you. Where is it? It was here just now. -Where's that Wira? -I have a lot of Wiras. Which one -are you talking about? -The green Wira. -I've sold it. -What? You have no right to sell it! That car has not been fully paid for. The owner hasn't paid for six months. I've been instructed by this lady to repossess the car. I didn't know that. The owner said that the payment had been cleared, and he gave me the grant too. He sold it at a low price. -So I bought it. -What? Hold this. Do you want me to hit your face? Is this really his house? This is the address that he gave me. If he lied to us, I will destroy him and his descendants. Peace be upon you. We're here to repossess your car. There's no answer. No one seems to be home. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you, too. Where are the people who live there? Azlee? I think he went out two or three hours ago in his new car. -New car? Where did he go? -I think he was going to Pahang. He's going on vacation to Cherating. Cherating? Try this. The chili is really strong. Here. You're finishing that? Dad, I have to pee. -Keep it in. -I don't care. I want to pee. Just stop on the side of the road. This is a highway. It's dangerous to stop. I don't care. I want to pee. -We'll be at the rest area soon. -He can't hold it anymore. What am I supposed to do? Pee in this bottle. Don't forget to throw it away, lest someone drink it. Who's going to drink it? Honey, pull over. What's wrong with you? -That guy. -Thank you, sir. Who told you to get in? Get out! -Then why did you stop the car? -What? Get out! What's wrong with you? He just wants a ride. If you want to give someone a ride, you have to see who it is first. Who knows, he could be a robber or a thief. Please don't make such assumptions. How could you call me a thief? Get out! You've become arrogant since you got this car. You can say anything you like as long as our family is safe. -How do you know that he's bad? -Bad guys come in all shapes and sizes. There are men, there are women. Some want to hitch a ride, others pretend that their car broke down. If he's a good guy, you've committed a sin towards him. EAST COAST -Thank you, sir. -How do you know that my name is Ong? My name is Ong Beng Heng. I'm sorry. I call everyone that. You think I'm a woman? Never mind. Ouch! What's wrong? Do you want a ride or not? Crazy. Sir, can you look at my car? Sir! Mr. Azlee? Imagine seeing you again. There was a cloud of smoke, and my car refused to start. -What's the problem? -I don't know. We know how to drive, but we don't know what to do when the car breaks down. -Sorry, sis. We can't help you. -Yes. We can call the tow truck, though. It's okay. Thank you. Besides, Mr. Azlee can help me. -That's good. -He has rescued me before. In that case, we'd better go. Bye. What a handsome guy. -Miss Linda, I think your radiator-- -Just call me Lin. It's better that way. -Sorry. -It's okay. It has to be the radiator. There's no more water left. Did the temperature rise? I don't know. But my temperature is definitely rising. Darling? Huh? -What are you doing here? -I'm looking at this lady's car. It looks very bad. What is your name, miss? Linda. -What's wrong with it? -I don't know. Mr. Azlee said the radiator overheated because my temperature rose. The radiator overheated. Shoot at his face. What's going on? -It's not raining and yet you're wet. -Don't mess with me. So, you're from Indonesia. Why are you angry? So, you're going to the East Coast? Why didn't you say something? Hop in. Francis, I have a little problem. My car broke down. I'm at… -Where are we, Azlee? -We're approaching Temerloh. Yes. Temerloh. My car will go there for repairs. Please tell the boss that I'll arrive late in Cherating. Okay? Bye. You're going to Cherating too? What a coincidence. Actually, I work there. -What do you do? -I'm a singer. -You can watch me sing. -We'll see. My name is Yasin alias Haryono Sutrisno. I'm from West Java, but Malaysia is almost like home to me. -Did you enter legally or illegally? -Legally, of course. I don't want to shame my country. I've been here for two years to look for money. I've done so many jobs. -Why do you want to go to the East Coast? -To gain experience. I heard that the girls are really pretty. -Your intention is not good. -It's not a crime. I'm still single. But why go so far just to find pretty girls? There are many Juhi lookalikes there. -Juwie? -Yes. Not Mama Juwie but Juhi Chawla. Dil to Pagal Hai's heroine. -What is this? -I have her cassette. May I put it on? My God! You're obsessed with Hindustan songs. -Thank you for helping me. -You're welcome. -Do you want me to talk to the mechanic? -It's okay. I'll manage. -Where are you staying in Cherating? -We're going straight to Terengganu for an island holiday. Move, quick. "Do you want me to talk to the mechanic?" What's wrong with you? You're jealous. Only an idiot wouldn't be jealous. -I know you like her. -Who said that? We've been together for ten years. I'd know you even if you wore a saree. Stop thinking about it. I don't like her at all. Would you swear on that? -It's not good to swear. -If you lied, then it wouldn't be good. -Take me back to my mom's house. -You do this every time we have a fight. Why is it so dark? I can't see! Sir, are you okay? Help me! I cannot see. -Whose car is that? -It's mine. I'm sorry. -Sorry? What if I died? -Yes, it's our fault. Are you hurt? Blood! I'm badly wounded. Darling. Take him to the doctor! Why are we stopping here? -Have you ever beaten up someone? -Yes. Good. Come with me. -Hello? -Whose car is this? I found the car in Temerloh. Can you drive? It's okay. I have someone who can do it. Okay. I feel like I've seen it, but where? Let's wait here. The moment he gets back, we beat him up. Take the keys and follow me back to Kuala Lumpur. I seek forgiveness in God. -I'm a repo. Don't worry. I'll pay you. -No. -I helped you, now you must help me. -I don't beat people up. -I used to get beaten up often. -Calm down. He won't fight back. I'm scared. We have a change of plan. Don't talk too much. Send someone over. Just send someone. I'm sorry. You're not mad, are you? Where are you headed to on the East Coast? I don't know. I'll go where fate takes me. May I have your phone number? -Here. -Thanks. I'll go now, sir. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you, too. I'm going. -How is he, Doctor? -It's hard for me to say. Why? Is he badly hurt? -You shouldn't have brought him here. -Where should we have taken him? He should've been taken to a specialist hospital. -Is it that bad? -What specialist, Doctor? A mental specialist. Stop it, Saiful. I know you're not unconscious. Hey. Nurse, get me the biggest syringe that we have. Where am I? What is this place? -Get up. -I'm sick. I can't walk. -The doctor said you're not sick. -What does he know? Let's go. Ignore him. You can't go just like that. I want compensation. I left my money in the car. Please give him ten ringgit. What do you think I am? A chick? I want 100 ringgit. Or I'll go to the police. Why is that guy taking our car? -My car. -Hey! -That's my car! -Whose car? -My car! -Who are you? Ouch! -It's my car! -My car! One at a time, please. You say your car is stolen and you claim that the stolen car is stolen. -What is the truth? -I bought the car. I have proof. What do you know? You were scammed. The car you bought was stolen. -But it's my car! -This is a police station. If you want to make a fuss, go to the market. -How many people did you see in the car? -One. -Hi! I'm Wahid. Do you need a ride? -Sure, sir. Thank you. I feel like I've seen this car before, but where? All cars are the same. There goes our plans. We've waited months for this vacation. Please be patient. It's fate. -Zali, why did you kick his leg? -Our car got stolen because of him. -That's true. Kick his other leg. -Wait! It's not good to teach children to beat people. But you can learn from me. That's enough. This is all your fault. If you hadn't given the woman a ride, you wouldn't have hit this man, and our car would never have been stolen. All this is your fault. Let's go. -Zati. -Hey, relax. Let her go. She's angry right now. She'll be all right in a while. -I want 300 ringgit. -Why? Your son kicked my leg. I'll give you 500 on one condition. I'll pummel your face first. -What would you like to order? -What's your specialty? Fried rice, fried noodles, bandung noodles, and hailam noodles. -Fried rice, then. -It's finished. -Fried noodles? -It's also finished. -Bandung noodles? -Also finished. -But you said you had everything. -You asked about our specialties. -The special ones sell out fast. -All right, hailam noodles. -One portion of hailam noodles. -Two. It's out too. -Hindustani songs are nice, aren't they? -Yes. -Are they popular in Indonesia? -Very popular. Who's more popular there? Shah Rukh Khan or Salman Khan? -Salman Khan, of course. -Why? -He's handsome. -But here, it's Shah Rukh Khan. You say his name and all the girls go weak at the knees. I keep my hair long. Do I look like Shah Rukh Khan? Sure, but you look more like "Sorok Kain." I'm thirsty. Why don't we have a drink? -We're still far from there. -Yes, I'm thirsty, too. There's some water here. You drink first. Thank you, sir. I'll drink it first. -You go ahead. -You first. You drink first, then I'll drink it. You drink first. I will drink it after you. What's wrong, sir? It tastes strange. I think I've drunk it before, but where? Who is this? Wait for me in Rantau Panjang. So cool. May I see that? -May I make a call? -Who do you want to call? -Your relatives in Indonesia? -No, I want to call a friend. He gave me a ride before you. -Go ahead. -Thanks. Who is this? It's you, Yasin. Where are you? I'm in Mr. Wahid's car. -Who's Wahid? -You don't know him, but his heart is as good as yours. Let me introduce you. -His name is Mazlan. -It's okay. -Talk to him. -It's okay. Say hello to Wahid. Take this. Don't be shy. Hello, Mr. Wahid. Hello, Mr. Mazlan. What do you want to say? Just do it, Mr. Wahid. He's such a simpleton. When are you going to pay me? I want to go home. I don't have money to pay you. My wallet is missing. I don't have any money. Even if I did, I would never give it to you. Calm down. Eat first. What's going on? Can you shut up? I'm talking on the phone. Can I borrow it? Is this the way to borrow someone's stuff? Hello, Mr. Wahid, I'm so sorry. -Who do you want to call? -Someone. It's our only chance to get our car back. Please let me borrow it. Oh, like that. So, you're from the north? I have some relatives there too. You're so rich. You have two phones. Holiday? Peace be upon you. Who is that? I'm Yasin. Do you want to talk to Mr. Wahid? There are two of them. One is Yasin, the other is Wahid. Hey, thief! Give me back my car! You got the thief? Thief? Who's the thief? Who took your car? He shouted back at me. Sorry, Mr. Wahid. My friend has just managed to contact the car thief. I know this guy. It's the Indonesian who tried to hitch a ride with us. I knew it. You're a crook. You'll never get away with this! He said I'm a crook. I don't want to talk to him. Mr. Mazlan, I'm sad. I'm not a crook, yet he called me one. -Who called you a crook? -I know their names. One is Yasin, the other is Wahid. Hello. Who is that? This one sounds like Mazlan. Mr. Mazlan? Mr. Mazlan? -Hello? -Sir? Mr. Mazlan? Yasin, listen to me carefully. Wahid is a crook. That car is stolen. You'd better tell me where you are now. I'm at… Azlee Jaafar? This is not your identity card. If you want to hitch a ride, behave yourself. -Where are you going? -I'm going to follow the car. We'll talk about who owns it later. We have to save the car first. Why is he coming with us? I don't care. As long as I don't get my 100 ringgit, I won't let him go. -What do you want from me? -I'm a car thief. I've never hurt anyone. -So, I want you to calm down. -Give me my tape back. Oh dear, it's out. This one's out too. This one is also out? Can you slow down? I feel dizzy. -We can't slow down, or he'll get away. -Don't mind him. What a nuisance. Oh, my God! My car! I want to get out. You said you wanted to go to the East Coast. No. I don't want to be your accomplice. Like it or not, they know what you look like, -but they don't know what I look like. -But I know. Who would believe you? I swear that I'm innocent, sir. I was framed. -Don't lie. We know that you did it. -No, I didn't do it. Stubborn, aren't you? Let's beat him until he owns up. No! Ouch. STOP POLICE INSPECTION I'm sorry. There's a queue. What's wrong with you? Move on! Move on! -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. May I see your identity card? -Are you from Kuala Lumpur? -Yes. -What's wrong with him? -He's sleeping in faith, sir. -Give me his identity card. -His identity card? Look at the car back there. It looks strange. Take a look at it. -You can go. -Thank you. Answer the phone. Hello? Yes. Thank you. -The police found our car. -Really? Yes, they found it. Sir, I'm Azlee. Thank you for finding my car. This is my car. So, you're the thief! Take off that fake beard. -Let go. It hurts. -Why is it stuck? -I'll sue you. -I'll sue you because you stole my car. -This is my car. -My car! -It's mine. -It's mine. -It's his car. -What did I say? It's my car! This is my car. The car is his. This is yours. Make sure you sue him. There is a car over there. Let's get a ride, hurry! Where are you going? Is this your car? -He is mute. -But he has a car. Can you give us a ride? He can't talk. My car broke down. My uncle and I would like to hitch a ride with you. If it's okay, drop your head. Quick, bring him. That's my uncle. He is the bridegroom. Can you take us a little bit further? Careful! Hurry! -Slow! -Careful! Sit, go slow. -Careful! Hurry! -Sit. Careful, don't mess your clothes. Go behind, push the car. Go, push. Where are we going to look for the car? We'll look for it on the East Coast. The Indon might be part of a syndicate over there. Don't accuse him of such things. Yasin is innocent. -How do you know? -I know he's innocent. -How do you know? -I know. I work as a repo. I know all the crooks, but Yasin is not one of them. He's the worst of them all. He looks like a nice guy, but inside, he's rotten like this one. For that uncalled for accusation, I demand bigger compensation. 500 ringgit. Thief. Enough! Stop it. I'm driving. There goes my car. -Wait. Slowly. Everyone, wait. -Oh, my God. My car is wrecked. Darling, I want to get out. Wait, or the car will fall into the ravine. Get out! Zali. -Help me push the car. -Who cares about it? How did you get your license? Blood! I'm badly injured. Azlee. Are you hurt? Dad. My car broke down so we were delayed. Come quickly. -Come. -Never mind. Come. Put the tray down. Take the garland. Put it on the bride. Put it on. Help! Let me out! How is it? Okay? Is it nice? How did we get here? Juhi? Juhi Dil Pagal? My name is not Juhi. I'm Kamala. -Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you. -You brought me to my true love. If you hadn't helped us, I don't know what would've happened. I helped you because you've rescued me before. My husband likes to help people. I like to help people too. If your car is repossessed, call me. -I like to help people too. -Yes, help get them into trouble. I'll go back first. -Where are you going? -You said you found your true love. -What else do you want? -You can't run away. If the police arrest me, I want you to be arrested too. -I'll hit you. -If you do, -I'll raise a storm. -What storm? -Where are you going? -To the shop. -My grandmother wants some tobacco quid. -Want me to come with you? -No, thanks. It's not very far. -What a coincidence. I'm going to the shop too. Let us give you a ride. It's okay. -Who told you to ask her to hop in? -Don't say anything. What did I tell you? Follow that car! Where are you going? -There's the Indonesian guy. -I told you, but you didn't believe me. Who's driving? I didn't see his face. Follow them! Don't let them get away! -What is this? How are you driving? -Where are you going? -Help! -Stop! -Help! -Sir? Where does he want to go? Help! I want to get out. Calm down. I said, stop! Where does he want to go? Oh dear, there are people following us. -Calm down. I'm here. -Help! Help! I want to get out! Oh, no! -Oh no! -Give me a hand! If I'm not mistaken, there's a dead-end right in front. Oh, my! My bike! Quick! Get out. There's a signal. Ah Meng, what number came up today? What's wrong? -You're looking for a lottery number. -Hello? Huh? There's no number? The battery is dead. -Dad, I'm hungry. -Be patient. Wait until the rain stops. -Who farted? -No manners at all. -It must've come from the fat lady. -Watch your mouth! It wasn't me. I didn't say it was you. Who did that? If I find out who did it, I'll whack him. -The culprit left his wallet inside. -Where? Where? There's no wallet in there. I'm innocent, ma'am. I was framed. Kamala, help me. He's innocent. He didn't kidnap me. Fine, but we'll still interrogate you about a stolen car. That's Wahid, not me. There you are! That's the guy who stole my car! You have to make a report first. Mr. Mazlan, I was framed. Help me. Ma'am, take a seat. Actually, the car is still under the finance company. I was instructed to repossess the car and take it back to KL. I hope you can let Yasin go. He didn't steal the car. -But he was in the car! -The girl was there. Are you accusing her too? I want to lodge a complaint. This man molested me. Is there any witness? Thank you, everyone. Only God can repay your kindness. -What's next? -We have to go back to KL. I want to see my car. I want to see Kamala's parents to assure them that she is safe. I… -I want my money. -I don't have any money. -So, you're the one who took it! -Wait. If he wanted to steal it, he wouldn't have returned it to you. Why are you smiling? I don't have any money. Now I have to use the ATM. There's no ATM in this town. Wait, Cherating is not far from here. Why don't all of you spend the night at the hotel where I'm singing? -I can ask for a discount. -Which hotel is that? -Hotel Awana. -I work there too. -Really? -Yes. -What do you do? -I'm a cleaner. Sometimes I also do room service. Incidentally, I'm supposed to work tonight. What a coincidence indeed. -Yes. We had a lot of that today. -It seems so illogical. Okay, let's go. Let's go. There's no way everyone can squeeze in. Raymond. Which Ray is it? Was it from Mengidam Boutique? I called Mengidam Boutique, and you said that you didn't go there. I went out to see my friend. A friend or your boyfriend? I saw both of you at the golf range. Hugging each other. Since when have you been a spy? -Actually, I already knew. -Let's go to the cafe. It's just that I caught you red-handed today. I want you… And then be together with you again? It's hard to live with you in this big house. Don't forget that you're having an affair with my model. He's taking the car to Thailand. Can you contact our agent there? You gobble everything. Aren't you finished yet? I want to take a bath too. I'm drunk and now my eyes are sore Rock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors. Sleep down there. Sleep right here. -Sleep right here. -Huh? I'm having… an affair with a woman. I knew it. You've changed. -Aren't you going to tell me who it is? -She's one of your models. Who? Emma? Janet? Julia? Zati. Zati? How could you do this to me? You're my best friend. I'm also your husband's good friend. And as a good friend, I don't have the heart to see him suffer because of you. We are going to get married. All right. I have a confession too. Don't think that you're the only one who can play this game. Az. -This is my lover Azlee. -We're going to get married when you've divorced her. Iddah? -I haven't divorced her yet. -You will as soon as you see this. -May I take your order, sir? -Fresh orange. Do you know her? She keeps smiling at you. I've been here for quite a while. She hasn't even looked at me. How much? You don't have to pay. It's my treat. Put it on my check. Thank you. I would like to take a break. Stay tuned. Hi. You sing very well. Let me introduce you to my friend. What's your name? There's a phone call for you. -Where are the others? -They've gone to bed. -What time do you finish work? -Two. -Then what? -Then I'm off to bed. Why so early? Why don't we go dancing? Mr. Mazlan, you're quite a naughty man. Miss Linda, sorry. Where were we? Azlee. Azlee. What's happening? What does she see in him? I'm better looking than he is. -Who is he? -A pest. He's married, but still, he prowls on other women. He takes all the pretty ones -and leaves none for singles like us. -Why don't you court his wife and teach him a lesson? I have problems sleeping this time of the night. Because of something or someone? What if she wakes up and finds her husband gone? She won't wake up, even if there's an earthquake. That's good. What if we're the ones who cause the earthquake? She won't know, right? It's so cold. Feels like a refrigerator. Where is the switch? Aren't you cold? Help me find the control switch. Hey. Where's Mr. Mazlan? We have to report this to the manager. She can't sing for him alone. Be patient. Don't be mad at Miss Linda. Maybe he used black magic on her. That's human nowadays. Nothing else but black magic. We're in the new millennium, but there are folks who believe in that. We'll never progress if we believe that. That's superstitious. Excuse me. I have to go to the toilet. Please keep this amulet for me. Why didn't you invite us along? Aren't you going to invite us to drink with you? Wow, you're relaxing. What's the most expensive food around? -Who's going to pay for this? -You. I think I want to work here. Then I can see-- I'm sorry. Where's the toilet? The toilet is outside. Praise be to God. Why haven't you ordered anything? It's on me. It's okay. -The service is very fast. -That belongs to my friend. He went to the toilet. Didn't you see him on the way? No. I didn't notice anyone. What? You know what makes this place famous? -The pristine beach. -Right! But there's an even better place. But not many people know of it. The place is top secret. You have a message. MEET ME IN ROOM 237 AFTER 2 A.M. LINDA. What's that? -What is it, Zali? -I peed. -Ask your father to clean it. -Daddy's not here. That's all for tonight, and don't forget to join me at the same time tomorrow. Good night. Let's go there now. We have to wait for my friend. It's okay, Kamala. I'm just a little wet. Over here as well. -Where did he go? -Maybe he went back to the room. I'm so sleepy. I'll go back to my room to sleep. It is nice to sleep at this hour in my room. I want to go back to my room. How many times does he have to say "room"? -Where's your friend? -Which friend? -The one who came with you. -He was with you. Wait for me in the lobby while I go and look for him. -Is there a plan? -Of course. A good one too. -Have you seen my husband? -He said he was going back to his room. -Who was that? -That was his wife. Excuse me. There's a call for you at reception. Wait here. After you, sir. Mr. Azlee! What are you doing here? Are you following me? I'm just helping Kamala do her work. Why are you here? -Aren't you supposed to be with Mazlan? -I forgot all about him. Excuse me, Kamala. I'll see you later. May I help you? I'm looking for my room. Room 237. Mr. Mazlan. -Where were you? -I was talking to Kamala. -Let's go. -Where to? Just come along. -Where is he? -Who? He went off. Something important, he said. -I was deceived. -He left his car keys and a map. -Excuse me. -Kak Zati, where are you going? -I'm looking for my husband. -But he already went back to your room. No, he didn't. I've called my son in the room several times. That's odd. I showed him the room myself. -I'm not used to this. -I know. -I'm not sure whether it's right or wrong. -We'll think about that tomorrow. -What if we get caught? -Then we can get married. -Get married? -I fell for you when we first met. But I'm married. -I don't think Zati would agree. -But you agree. -If not, you wouldn't be here. -I'm sorry. It's not that I don't want to. I do, but I have to think it over. What's wrong? That didn't take long. Open the door! I know you're inside! Who is it? -Open this door. -Who is that? Open this door! Shut up. Stay out of this. Quick, open this door. I know you're inside. -Escape through this window. -Oh, yes. Take care of yourself. Open! Open this door. Open! Open this door. Open! I know you're inside. Quick! Open this door. -This is mine. -You wear men's coats? What are you doing here? You were so bent on going back to your room. This car… How do you know that we're looking for it? Look at the number plate. It's the correct number. -Give me the key. -Why should I? He gave it to me. But he's my friend. Are you coming? But… Don't be afraid. My friend let us borrow it. He invited us to a nice place. I feel like I've seen this car before, but where? -What place is this? -Just come along. Go. Can we go in? Let's go. You have to pay first. -How much? -How many of you are there? -Four. -Twenty. -Twenty cents for four, that's cheap. -Twenty ringgit! Even in KL, we pay only 20 cents. Is there any gold inside? -Never mind. -Are you nuts? We came all the way to pay 20 ringgit to use the toilet? That's considered cheap. Hello! Four people. Welcome to Skodeng Park. Skodeng? After you. -I thought "skodeng" meant… -Will you please… What? Please shut up. Be my guest. Be my guest. What are you looking at? Don't push. Are they chicks or elves? What is this? -These are the white girls who stay here. -They're dancing without clothes. -Aren't the police going to arrest them? -The police don't know about this. Unbelievable! It's so nice. Go and find another girl. -Move! -What is this? Move! Move! Stay right there. Sir. -Get in. -Sir. Get in! Quick. What about us? Last night, the Skodeng Park was raided. All of them were arrested. They had it coming. Wait! This is my car. You'll have to settle it at the police station. -It's my car. -Go to the police station. There you are. Why didn't you tell me where you were going? I invited him. Why didn't you wear your swimming trunks? I'm not wearing my swimming trunks. Are you only wearing your underwear? I'm not wearing anything. I'll be responsible for whatever happens. He's my son. Why should you be responsible? That's what I want to talk to you about. Have a seat. I want to treat Zali like my own son and Azlee… like my own husband. I'm willing to share. I believe Azlee can divide his love fairly. About last night, you don't have to worry. Yes, Azlee was in my room, but nothing happened. Only… Azlee confessed that he loves me. You have to accept this fact. Zali, I'm going back to the room. PASIR GAJAH POLICE STATION I must go back to the hotel immediately. My wife and son must be worried. That's my friend's car. You brought our car here. You're so kind. -This is your car? -It belongs to my friend. He loaned it to us. I'm supposed to return it to him this morning. What's his name? -What was his name? -I don't know. He's your friend. The name is not important, but I have to get this car back to him. You can't. No one can take this car anywhere. -We suspect that this car is stolen. -How do you know? The number plate and the registration number are different. The road tax has been blacklisted after the car was reported to be stolen. Maybe… Please come with us to the station. Sir, where are we going? I can't. The car has been taken to the police station. I can't do anything. Tell him that I'll find another car. I'll wait for your call. -Why did you come in? -You didn't hang the "don't disturb" sign. You don't have to clean the room. I'm going to check out. It's my job, sir. -Do you like Hindi movies? -You can say that. A lot of Malay people like to watch Hindi movies. Not just Malays. Indonesians like them too. I met this Javanese who likes Hindi movies a lot. -He even wants to find an Indian wife. -What's his name? I don't really know him. I was at an Indian wedding feast yesterday, and he met this Hindi heroine look-alike. How did you get here? Let me go! Help! Zati, I found our car. -I want to check out now. -What about your husband? Ask him yourself. Get me a KL taxi. -Zali, how can you leave me alone here? -Mom said you have Linda. Move aside. Let's go, Zali. Are you going to leave me just because of this? I know I'm not what I was ten years ago, but you have to remember beauty doesn't last. You like Linda now, but in ten years' time, -she might look like me. -In ten years' time, I will be old too. Don't worry. Sooner or later, someone will come looking for you. I have to go. Bye. Are you all right? I'm sorry for-- What's going on here? These three will act as our witnesses. Is it true that you have never said -that you love Linda? -I swear I never said that to Linda. -How do you really feel inside? -That's true. You might not say it, -but you might feel it. -If I don't say it, that means -there are no feelings. -That's not necessarily the case. You said you wanted to eat. Maybe you just want to do something else. Calm your wife first and say that you don't have any feelings for Linda. Is it true that you have no feelings for Linda? It's true that I don't have any feelings for her. Yes. The game has changed. I believe you because you've never lied to me before. This is the first time. -Wahid. -Wahid? Where? When did he walk past us? I don't know. Where's Zali? He's nowhere to be found. Zali? Darling, there's Zali. My car. Zati is going to leave me. I don't know what to do. You can build a new life with me. That's what I'm thinking of. But… But… But what? But I don't want you to replace Zati. I've been with Zati for ten years. I can't shove her aside just like that. That's why I love you. I know I'll get true love from you. But… But… But what? But what can I do? I'll have to nurse my broken heart. Our love will never be a reality. Goodbye, my Azlee. I hope you're not going anywhere because, for the first time, we bring you Zati and the Senario boys. Get away from her. What did you do? Why did you throw that thing away? Enough! Let's go. -It's finished. Let's go. -Let's go. Let's go! What are you waiting for? The show is over.
