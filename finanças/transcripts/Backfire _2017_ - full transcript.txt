We going to be living in a cardboard box on the side of that street if you don't figure out -these accounts. -Why ain't you just say that? I can pick up some cardboard boxes on the way home today from the U-Haul. Why you so stupid? Two people were shot last night near Gerard Avenue. Detectives believe it was a robbery gone wrong. Dominic Savastano of the famed Savastano South Philly Mob Family was attacked alongside his girlfriend, Ashley Stables. Police have no witnesses or suspects. If you have any information... ...please call the PPD to report. You going to find some work today? Yeah, yeah, I got you. Hey. And you. Don't give your sister too much trouble today in school, okay? -Promise. -Pinky swear? -Pinky swear. -All right. -You be good, all right? -All right. She's going to walk you. Sit tight. She'll be right there. Hey, I'll call you later, babe. I got to take care of some business real fast, okay? All right. And my journal entry was about Paul Bunyan. Paul Bunyan? What they teaching you about Paul Bunyan? He was so big when he was a baby, they had to have five storks for him. And, oh, and he had a pet ox. The ox was blue. And the ox got thirsty, so he dug a hole to put water in, and the hole was so big, it turned into a lake. Oh, wow. Isn't that useful? -What's good, yo? -Where you at? I'm chilling out at the house. All right. I'm about to come over. -All right. Good. -All right. Hey. What's up, Jer-man? -What's up? -Nothing. -You see the news? -Oh, hell. Nah, man. I don't watch the news. Nothing but bullshit lies. I told you that. -Yeah? -Yeah. That bullshit that happened last night was on there this morning. -Saying what? -Saying how both people died. Police looking for suspects and witnesses. And dude was part of the fucking mob. Okay. So? -So what? -So what? Yeah, they got no suspects. They're not going to find any witnesses. So what are you worried about, dude? Not listening? I'm listening. Go ahead. Say it again. Dude wasn't just anybody, cuz. He was part of the fucking mob. Yeah, but that's the fucking key word there, Rome, "was." He was part of the mob. He dead now. It don't matter. We good, man. You got to just calm down a little bit. Have a beer. You want a beer?

Don't be keeping him out all night like that, Jerome. He's about to be a married man, needs to learn to get his ass in the house at a decent hour. -Mm-hmm, yeah. I'm trying. -I'm sure Aminah tells you -the same thing. -Mm, not at all. Order some takeout for dinner later. -Please don't forget. -I got you. Yo, dude. What the fuck? -What? -She's got the fucking watch on. Ah, that's -- Nah, that's nothing, man. -No witnesses, remember? -No money, remember? We were supposed to sell the shit. Okay, yeah.

Well, I don't fucking think so. Get rid of him. He was a piece of shit anyway. Clean it up. Why do I always got to be the one to clean it up? This is fucking ridiculous.

Hi, Denise. Come on in. Dominic, you're standing already? I'm not so sure that's the best idea. I know you're eager to recover, but I'm worried your wounds are going to open back up. Here, let's have a seat. Let me take a look. Hey. Dominic made a very interesting discovery since the last time you were here. He wanted to talk to you about it. -Sure, yeah. Everything okay? -Yeah. You know what? He's still a little weak. Why don't you, you know, scooch in? -Sure. -You know? What's up? Yeah, that's a real nice watch. See y'all tomorrow, round two. Fuck. Oh, man. Oh, shit. You better have a good fucking reason for being in my house right now. Once upon a time, there was a man. And this man was enjoying his night with a beautiful young woman. The two were really hitting it off. The night was going great, and I mean great. So, this man and his lady friend, they're taking a lovely stroll, enjoying the cool night breeze, minding their own business, when, all of a sudden, two thugs with guns jump out and mug him. And not only do these cock suckers rob him, but they shoot and kill the guy and his lady for no fucking reason at all. Guy that got shot that night was me. And I remember asking the thug if he knew who he was fucking with. And he said he didn't care. That is a great story, great fucking story. Shakespearean almost. But you know what? The thing is, I feel like whatever thug you're talking about probably still doesn't care. And now you got about three seconds to tell me why I shouldn't fucking shoot you right now, this time make it count. Okay. But before you do that, I need to ask you a favor. -Ran out of those years ago. -Put the gun down. We're going to have a little conversation, you and me. -Come on. -All right. All right. Have a seat in your chair, big man. So, what do you boys want to do? I ain't got no money. You care now, motherfucker? No. I don't. I bet your girlfriend cares. You don't even know my girlfriend, man. -Y'all are fuck-- -Oh, you mean Denise, the one that treated my gunshot wounds? -If you fucking touch her -- -If I fucking what?! What the fuck you going to do, huh? You going to fucking kill me like you killed my girlfriend? Yeah. Just like that. Ah, that's cute. -You like? -Mm-hmm. -I like. -Yeah. Okay. -Let's see how much you like. -Okay. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. You going to fucking do nothing. Yo. O.T., come on, man. We got to get this money up. Yo, O.T.! Yo. O.T., you in there? Yo, O.T.? You in here? Yo, this shit ain't funny, man. Where you at? O.T.! Shit. Fuck, man. Oh, fuck, man. What the fuck? Fuck, man. Oh, shit. What the fuck, man? O.T., man, what the fuck, man? Oh, fuck. Denise. Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck, man. What the fuck, man? Fuck, man. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. -Smoke, where you at? -At the house. What's up? Get Aminah and get out the house now. -Like, right now. -Aminah at work. Are you sure? No, no, no. Today's her day off. She probably in her room still asleep. What's going on? Everything cool? No, shit is all fucked. I'll explain it to you when when I see you. Aminah. Get up. Aminah, wake up now. -Why? What's wrong? -Let's go. We got to go. -We got to go. -Smoke, you're scaring me. What's going on? Where's Jerome? I just got off the phone with Jerome. He told me to get out of here. We got to go. We got to go now. It didn't sound good. Come on. Let's go. We got to go now. Oh, shit. Come on. We got to go. Drop the bags. We got to go now. Smoke! Aminah! Yo, Smoke! Smoke! -Yo, where you guys at? -I don't know, man. Out a couple of blocks from the house. Tell Aminah to meet me at her mom's house right now. Okay. Yeah, I'll meet you guys there. All right. Where the fuck they go? I thought you were chasing after them. I was shooting after them. They cut down the alley. You're supposed to follow them. Why the fuck am I the only one supposed to follow? Come on. Fucking, Billy, you know you're faster than me. -Come on. -Jesus Christ, Tommy. How many times I got to tell you to lay off -the fucking meatballs? -Whoa, Billy. You always tell me that you love Donna's meatballs. -The fuck's this coming from? -I don't give a shit about the meatballs, Tommy. We fucking lost them. Marco's going to fucking kill us. Fuck! Fuck. What the fuck, man? Where the fuck are they at? -Oh, shit. -One of y'all going to tell me the what the hell that was just all about? Yo, you got a whole lot of explaining to do, fam! Fuck, fuck. I don't know how to say this shit, right? But I'm pretty sure the fucking mob is after me, man. After you? 'Cause I could swear it was just our asses out there dodging bullets just now! -Oh, fuck, man. -What the fuck, Jerome? -What did you do? -I didn't do shit! It was O.T.! He fucked up! Bad! No, this about the other night, that event that y'all went to, ain't it? Fuck, fuck. Yeah. It was -- Yeah, I fucking -- Man, come on, man. Just spit it out! All right. Okay. Listen, listen. Me and O.T. tried to catch a look the other night. We slid down on this couple in a side alley, and fucking O.T., it was just to get a couple watches and shit like that. And he flipped all out and killed them! I mean -- Where's O.T. at now, man? I found him and Denise at his house this morning. The mob got to him. No. -Damn, O.T. -I can't believe you, Jerome. -Not now, Aminah. Please. -Fuck you mean not now? Come on, man. Calm down. Us arguing and shit, shit ain't going to do nothing for us. We need to figure our next move. Okay, listen. I need you to take this. We're going to see O.G. Blood. I know he can tell us who these guys are after us. Well, I ain't staying here. O.G. still know everything in the world? We going to find out. Listen, Aminah, no disrespect, ma'am, but you can't come. O.G. is not going to let you in. That's just how he operates. -Plus, Kaya's coming. She's -- -I -- You're gonna have to watch her. She's coming home from school. God, I want to kill you sometimes. Shit, won't be able to do that if the mob gets to him first. -That's not funny. -Wasn't meant to be. -It's the truth. -All right. Fucking come on, man. Come on. We got to go. Listen, I'm going to fix this, okay? I promise. Fuck! You know, I have run this family for 20 years, Dominic, 20 Goddamn years. And you know why? I know that you do because I've been teaching you this shit ever since you was in diapers. I get rid of the weak links and people in my organization who make messes, who don't handle themselves. And now, now I'm about to make my firstborn son a made man, and look what he does. I have gunshots flying in the middle of the day. Those two shit heads waving guns around like hood rats, and two bodies, including a Goddamn nurse, left out like birthday presents for any cop with half a brain to connect back to you. I was sending a message. Oh, you were, really? Was it, "I'm a fucking idiot"? Look, there are ways to get things done, and there are ways not to get things done, okay? You're making a lot of noise. Our family members out there are getting a little nervous. Listen, Dominic, I understand that you're hurt. But we'll take care of it. We're going to get justice, I promise you that. Okay? But you got to get smarter than this. This ain't the fucking old days where you could run around and shoot everything up in front of people. It won't happen again, capiche? It won't happen again. -We'll take are of it. -All right. Okay. They found the girl. Billy and Tommy are on there way there now. Bring her in. No more mistakes. Okay. Let's get out of here. -Aminah! -Oh, my God. You scared me, Kaya! Don't run up on people like that. Why did we have to come to Mom's house? What's wrong with Mom's house? It smells funny. -You want some pizza for dinner? -Yeah. I'm going to have Jerome bring you home some, okay? Are you and Jerome going to get married soon? If I don't kill him first. I'll explain it to you when you get older, baby. -I'm almost 9. -I know. And you know what the best 9-year-olds in the whole, wide world do best? -What? -Their homework. What's up? Here to see O.G. Who are you? Tell him it's little Rome. Come on, man. Whoa. Who the fuck are you? I'm Rome's little brother. ♪ I like that joke ♪ I like that joke -♪ She wanna smoke right now -♪ Right now -♪ I like that joke, yeah -♪ I like that joke -♪ I'm-a do stuff this loud -♪ Loud -♪ I like that joke, yeah -♪ I like that joke -♪ That your ho right there -♪ Right there -♪ I like that joke, yeah -♪ I like that joke ♪ I like that joke, I like that joke ♪ ♪ I like that joke, yeah ♪ I like that joke, I like that joke ♪ -♪ I like that joke, yeah -I said I don't care.

You need my help to figure out how deep you're in it. Let me ask you a question. Why'd you go and shoot that couple? I told you a long time ago, you don't mix robberies with homicides. If you're going to kill them, kill them. If you're going to rob them, do the damn robbery. But never mix the two. So why'd you shoot? O.G., I didn't shoot them. It was O.T. He snapped out like he always do. Okay, you got jokes, huh? You're guilty just the same. And they're coming for you. And they will find you, believe you me. So what are you going to do? What if I find them? What if you find them? What if, indeed. This the guy you shot? Yeah, that's the boy right there. His name is Dominic Savastano, of the Savastano Italian mob family, Grays Ferry. His father's a made man, and he's walking in his footsteps. He's kind of crazy. He'll kill you if you look at his girl the wrong way, which you two more than did. The woman you two idiots murdered was his girlfriend since elementary school. Marco Savastano, the boss. You don't even fuck with him ever. You fuck with him, and I'll fuck you up as quickly as he will. You got me? I don't need that heat coming down on my family. Now, they missed you once. And if I had to take a guess, they'll be sending their guy Poncho after you. He's a sicario. Remember them boys, um... the No Picks gang? Yeah, the dudes over on the north side they found. Damn. That was all his work? All by himself. So -- So where do I find him? You don't. They'll find you. Why would you do that when you just watched me knock? What if they got the TV on in there? You can't hear shit that way, no? They're going to think we're cops, you slam it like that. Well, that's exactly what we want them to think. They call that psychological reverse. You never heard about that? You need your head checked out, Tommy. I'm serious. May I help you? Nope. Fuck I'm going to do, man? Word, man. We're going to get out of this, Rome.

Aminah, baby, we on our way back now. What? Wait, what? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Why'd you leave the house? I told you not to leave. All right. I'll be right there. Stay right there. -Where to? -Fuck, man. Bar 27. That joint on Sergeant Street? -Yeah. -Shit, what, we partying now? I don't fucking know. I couldn't really hear her. She's crying and screaming over the fucking phone, man. But I know it's important. We got to go. Let's do it. Damn it, Aminah, shit. Why did you leave the house? -This is serious shit I'm in. -I know. I know. I know. I-I just went out for some fresh air, and then I saw the car in the back, so I ran. Okay. So where is Kaya? What? What? Nothing. Don't turn around. Just keep looking at me. Bro, just give me the word. There's someone that wants to talk to you. Oh, yeah? Who? Got a car out back. I'll be happy to show you. And you're going to get up nice and slow, and you're going to walk with me to the exit. -Capiche? -Your buddy and your girl are going to stay right here with me. Don't worry about it, baby. Everything will be all right. Let's go. Get up. Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I heard what's been going on. -No. No. No. No. -Man, watch out, man. Oh, shit. What's good, Smoke?

Look, Rome, we fam and all, but I don't got time for them coming here and feeling up the place, yo, and can't find you and wind up shooting me. With my luck, yo, I'll be the one to get hit. I just know it. I don't got no luck in this world. -I'll be the one to get hit! -Listen, listen. You either going to let me stay here tonight, use the car, or I'm going to tell Aunt Shirley you was the one who crashed her fucking car driving home drunk the other night. And I'm going to tell your baby mom about your little son, Mikey, that you got around the corner by that little dirty-ass girl. Y-You know about little Mikey? Uh, uh, uh, everybody know about little Mikey. Your girl need to learn how to keep her mouth shut. Hey, watch it. All right, man, yo. Fuck. Here's the keys, man. Make sure you lock up, man, the morning before you leave. All right, man. -I love you, bro. -I love you, too. You really think I wasn't going to let you stay here? Come on, man. I was just playing. Come on. Look, man, it's TV -- TV remote right there, yo. Yo, it's food in the fridge, all right, y'all? -I'm going to bed. Good night. -Good night, Rell. -Good night, Aminah. -Good night. -You okay? -Sometimes you ask me the stupidest fucking questions, I swear. You out here murdering women, smashing bottles over the fucking mob's heads. Where -- No, where is this supposed to go? -Where is this going to end? -I got us here, right? We still here. We're alive, right? But we ain't stop yet. We've been running the entire time. We ain't had time to think. We ain't had time to eat. We ain't had time to do shit. Listen, what do you want me to do? I had to hit back. We had to do something. This is what I want you to do. I want you to make them think. Make them feel insecure. If we can make them think before they hit us again, then maybe we can come up with a plan. I knew you was good for something. Don't you even. Psst. Psst. Hey, hey, Rome. Hey, you not really going to talk about, you know, tell Auntie about the car, right? Or tell little Mikey? Good night, yo. All right. All right. All right. 'Cause I was just playing in my head, you know, man. Keisha find out, man, she straight psychopath. She'll cut my dick off, man. She would. -Good night, Rell. -Good night, Rell. A'ight. A'ight. A'ight. Good night. O.G., tell me something. Yeah, I know where that's at. Okay. Cool. Thanks. What'd he say? Said he know where some of the mob guys be at. It's a pizza spot over there on Snyder. Think I'm going to slide over there and pay them a visit, hit them back. Mnh-mnh. That don't sound good. None of this shit sounds good, okay? I'm sorry. Why don't we just get out of here? Why don't we just leave? -Can't. -Why not? Everybody I know, everything I got... -Everybody you know. -...is in this city. I'm -- It's my fucking city. I'm not leaving. Everybody we know is getting killed. Call your cousin Peaches. Peaches? What's Peaches going to do? Her wild ass? Just call her. I got an idea. Boston treating you great? You know, you put some work in, man, you get places in life. That's what happens. That's what happens. -I'm trying to keep telling you. -Had to put a few dudes down, but what you going to do, you know what I mean? Oh, shit. -God damn. -That's nothing, man. Man, you don't even know what you're talking about, bro. -The fuck you talking about? -Look at that shit, man. Hi. Can I help you? Hi. I'd like to place an order for... You should see the broads that boss brings home, okay? I've seen some of the broads the boss -- They ain't got nothing on this girl. -Oh, man, come on. -Look at that girl. Large pizza, extra large wings, -and... -Damn, dude. -I'll be right back. -Yo, Vic, come on, man. -She's probably a hooker. -Thanks. -Give it about 15, 20 -- -Hey, beautiful. -How you doing? -20 minutes. -Oh, hey, there. How are you? -You like pizza, huh? -Yeah, I love pizza. -Oh, yeah? Why don't you let me get a slice of that pie? I just might. Baby girl, I got all the sauce you can dream of. -Oh, really? -That's right. Why don't you tell me more, daddy? Yeah? What do you want to hear? -Yo, what the fuck? -Hey. Come on, let's go. Outside. Come on. Bye, baby. Fuck you! Dumb bitch! Nah, fuck you. You know what our enemies are thinking right about now? They're thinking that we're weak. They're thinking that we're fucking weak, and especially you, Dommy. And you know what? They have me wondering, too. Are you weak? Are you weak? Could it really be that you're so weak that two fucking nobodies from O.G.'s crew could put a bullet in your woman with you standing a foot away? -Fucking serious, Dad? -Hey! Why don't you put the fucking gun away, Ricky, and mind your fucking business? And then when you go after these two nobodies, not only do you fail repeatedly, which I fucking hate, but they turn the fucking tables on us and kill two of my best guys. So I ask myself. I ask myself, is my son weak? "Is my son weak?" Hey, Ricky. Mother fucker. Sorry! -Point a fucking gun at me! -Fucking sit down! Fucking gun on me. Hey, uh... Hey, Tony, if, uh -- If Ricky lives, tell him to never point a gun at my family again. -Capiche? -Yeah. Of course. Yes. Fuck. Yo, Poncho. Suit up. What's up? I'm here to rent two of your girls. I don't know where you got this shit from. Just ordered it from that Bulletproof spot down the street. They're all the same. What? This is way better. -Shit, man. -Yo. Yo. O.G. Blood and his whole crew just got gunned down. -What? -Yeah. By some hit-man psychopath. Whole house got lit up! -Shit! -How do you know for sure? I was walking past 57th and Baltimore. That's where they stay at, right? Right?! I knew this was a fucking bad idea. You guys got to go. Please! The fuck, Smoke, it's a fucking war! What do you expect? Shit like this happens! Yo, don't talk to me about war! You ain't never stepped foot in a real war zone! Smoke, I seen a car drive around here 6 times already. 6 times! All right, Rell, shut the fuck up! We going to leave your place, all right?! -Don't yell at him like that. -What? -It's not his fault! -Thank you, Aminah. Thank you. I think I helped you guys out long enough. Now, where you going? To figure out a better plan! So you just going to leave? I'm damn sure not going to be running around shooting up the city with you guys! All right. Go ahead. Run scared, then. Listen, you're not going to push my buttons, big bro. Every plan you had so far backfired on us! You got a better idea? No, but when I do, I'll give you a call. Just try not to get yourselves killed. Man, what the fuck the door ever do to you? Oh, so now we just going to fuck Rell house up, huh? Oh, never mind I opened the door with open arms, huh. -Just no, fuck -- -Shut the fuck up, Rell! I see how it is. Next message, sent Friday, April 11th. Yo, Rome, man, what's good, yo? Where you at, dawg? We out here at the club, man. Come through, yo. Yo, man, seriously, though, I think you know, man. I love you, dawg, man. I know I don't tell you this enough, but I really appreciate you, man. We -- Man, we going to get this money, yo. We run these streets, yo. Hey, hey! Baby, come here. A'ight. I'm going to hit you back, yo. End of message. You want to talk about it? Everything's all fucked up. Like, the fuck were we thinking, running in there like we was going to take on the fucking Mafia? You understand, don't you? O.G.'s fucking dead. O.T.'s fucking dead. They're just cutting everybody the fuck down, man. I need to go to the police. I don't see no other way out of this situation. Maybe they can shut this shit down or... help us. I don't know. Like -- What are you going to say, Jerome? "I killed a couple people, and now their whole family's after me. Oh, yeah, I killed a couple more yesterday. -Think you can help?" -I mean -- -I don't have to say that. -What, the cops? -I don't know. I -- -Then say what? What are you going to say to the cops? Anything. Anything to get us out of this situation. I mean, I don't see no other options. Babe, look at me. We're not going to the cops. No, babe, that's not an option. Then what's our options? What other options do we have? I'll think of something. You already fucked that up. God damn it, Jerome! Why don't we just... relax and go to bed? Yeah? Let's get you out of these clothes. Yeah? I think you're in the wrong room. Oh, shit. Aah! God! You fucking shot me! Mistake! Don't worry, man. Come on. Fuck! Come on! Let's go. Fuck, you shot me with a fucking tranquilizer gun! Jerome, no! Don't go to sleep! Jerome, stay the fuck up! Come on, baby. Stay with me. Come on. Come on. Come on! Baby, I'm sorry, but you got to stay up! Fuck! Shit! Aminah... what -- what -- where are we going? I got a place, babe, somewhere we'll be safe. All right? Just sit tight. We'll be there soon, okay? -Mm, where? -My friend. He's Italian, but we can trust him. Hey, Aminah! Hey, Louie! What's up, girl? Mm. How are you? The hell? Your boy seems a little banged up here. -Who you calling a boy? -Jerome, please. Anyway, how you doing? What's going on? We need some help. You know what? Let's get your boy a drink. We'll go back there, relax. You two look like you need it. Come on. Follow me. Mikey, bring a couple bottles to the back, please. Sure thing, boss. What'll it be? Doesn't matter as long as it's dark. Give me a minute. So, how you know Aminah? We go back. It's nothing, childhood shit. So how you still so familiar? Like I said, we go back. Anyway, you trust your girl, right? And she trusts me. And since I'm doing what I'm guessing is going to be a pretty big fucking favor, why don't we just move on, and you tell me what's up? Fine. We need some help. What's the jam? You know, uh, Dominic Savastano? Sure. Good guy. Crazy, but good. Why? Well, uh... a friend and I robbed him last week. Damn! So, that was you, huh? Big news travels fast. That's no secret, my man. Yeah, well, that's the issue, okay? Rome, brother, you got a problem. I already figured that part out, "brother." So? What do you want me to do? I don't know. Maybe help me kill him? Are you fucking nuts? Don't you ever say that in here again. You realize what this fucking lunatic is trying to do? -Jerome, chill. -Fuck this shit. We out of here. No, Louie's going to help us. Jerome, we are running out of options. All right. All right. I'm helping. Fine. Just relax. But we got to be extremely smart and careful about this. I appreciate it so much, Louie. Look, I got to go do some business things, so why don't you two just hang out here? Eat, drink, relax, 'cause you two look like shit. Hey, you need to take it easy on that a little bit. You one to talk. No, listen, I need you sharp, all right? -Fuck! -What? Damn Louie sold us out. Come on. -Fuck. -Jerome, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop! Wait! We lost them. -How'd they know we was there? -I don't know! -How'd they know? -How the fuck am I supposed to know? -What you coming at me for? -Because you took us there! That's because you was all fucked up on them Goddamn horse tranquilizers! -That you shot me with! -It was an ac-- You know what? I'm not even fucking feeding into this shit right now! -Feeding to what? -Louie was the only person that I could think of in the heat of the moment, and now you coming at me with this shit? Oh, fuck. Since when you start hanging out with Italian guys? The fuck is that supposed to mean? -You working with them? -What? No, I'm not working with them! Don't lie to me, Aminah. What am I supposed to say to you? Stop the car. I'm getting out. Pull over. I'm getting out. -So you can go and do what, huh? -Stop the fucking car, Aminah! I swear to God, if you don't stop this car, I'm going to jump out on the side of the fucking road! What you going to do? I'm going to fix this shit. What, you going to go and shoot yourself, then? Just calm down and get back in the car. Stop telling me to calm down! So what you going to do? Where you going? Yeah. It's Jerome. He about to do something real stupid. My daughter's friend brought over a dreidel last year for Christmas. It's a Jewish thing. I know it's a Jewish thing. Well, he's spinning the top like a dreidel. He's doing it right now. See? Why don't you think I know what a dreidel is? Oh, I forgot who I was talking to here, Mr. All-Knowing-Heritage-Man. -Right? -My father-in-law is Jewish. You met him like 15 fucking times already. -Saul? -Yeah. -Saul? -Saul. Hmm. I never would have pegged him for a Jew. Wow. You asked for me? I imagine you know why you're here. I do. So what's your excuse, Poncho? Don't have one. Tommy, what have you heard here about our friend Poncho? Well, that he's a legendary hit man that's come from the depths of hell to bless us with his gift of death. And if I were to send a street legend after a scrawny street rat and his girlfriend, what would you expect the outcome to be? That she stole his weapon and shot him in the neck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, not with a gun, only with a tranquilizer dart. Poncho? Yes, sir. One more chance. Should probably bring backup. Unless his girl is going to strong-arm him again. Yeah. Send a clean-up. I'm trying to tell you, man, on God, tequilas will change your motherfucking life, bro. Yeah. Appreciate you letting me crash, bro. Man, shit, as many times are you helped me out, you know I got you. Yeah, man, you be surprised how many people turn they back on you when you really need them the most, you know? One thing I miss about the service. You have watch out for the man next to you more than yourself, you know? Respect, man. Respect. -Where's Rome? -He's in trouble. -I knew it! -What kind of trouble? He ran off talking about how he was going to go -call the cops or some shit. -Man, fuck the pigs! No, he's really talking about ending it all right now. Like, he's really fucked up. Yeah, well, that's not going to happen. -Hell no, it ain't. -Well, you got another plan? -What you thinking? -You know what we should do? We should go to a hardware store, right, get some material, make a pipe bomb. I saw it on YouTube! It's easy. You're going to blow your fucking hand off with doing that, Rell! Fucking pipe bomb. I know what we need to do. We going to see Raj right now. What we waiting for? Let's go! Aminah, you good to stay here? Excuse me. Hey, yo! Yeah, I'm talking to you. Yeah, where you, uh -- Where you headed to in such a rush on this beautiful evening, huh? -I got a crime to report. -Oh. Well, how about that? It just so happens that, uh, I'm a cop. You can report it to me. I'd rather do it inside, thanks. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Buddy, just trying to have a civil conversation. There's no need to get all hostile. I'm not getting hostile. You better watch your tone, boy. You're addressing an officer of the law. I understand that. Do you? Yes. Now, if you don't mind, I would just like to -- You just want to report the crime, right? And I just fucking told you that you can report it to me right here, right now. -Man, look, I got to -- -Are you -- -Get off of me, man! -The fuck did you say to me? Get the fuck off me, man! Get up against the wall! Give me your fucking hands! Don't you say a fucking word. -Now get the fuck in there. -Man, get off me! -Get in there! -Ow! God! Fuck! You are one little active gangbanger, Jerome. You see what I mean? You got some fight in you. You know, this whole thing's been fascinating to me. We hit you. You hit back. We hit you harder. You hit back harder. You see what I mean? Here, let me illustrate. Now, quiet now, Aminah, if you want this to end well. You sure can talk. Is that a Dago thing or something? I'm just so glad to see you, my friend. We've all gotten to know each other so well these past few days -- me, you, your friend O.T., your homey O.G. Blood. I mean, the whole family, really, you know what I mean? Yeah, we've all gotten so especially close these past few days. Oh, and, Aminah... Yeah. We've gotten especially close. I thank you so much for bringing our mutual friend here to see me. Ouch. Looks like some broken trust. Shut the fuck up. I swear, Jerome, I was going to tell you all about it. I just thought it'd be so much more fun if you two had a chance to chat and catch up. As for me, my family is known for keeping its word. So I'll be back in couple minutes to uphold my end of the bargain. Use this time wisely. -Aminah. -I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry. They got my sister. -What? -They got my sister! May I help you? Nope. Those tranq darts are strong enough to knock out a fucking horse. -Scoot in there. -Come on. Aminah! -Aminah! -Aminah! You're either going to help us find your boyfriend, Jerome... Or your sister in the trunk, she's going to go swimming with the fishes at the bottom of the Schuylkill. Capiche? I'm sorry. Aminah! It's so sweet. Isn't it so sweet, Jerome? Get up. A man of my word. One big, happy family together again. Come on, Jerome. You're killing the moment. You know, I never thought I'd miss anyone as much as I miss my lady. Why? Because I've never been the type to have feelings before. Boy, Ashley, she actually made me feel feelings I never even knew that I had. And then -- And then you and your fucking punk-ass friend had to come and take her away from me and take away the little bit of feeling that I gained. I only tell you that 'cause I'd have killed that fucking rat-pig girlfriend of yours like it was Tuesday if it wasn't for my father. I guess Pops has more feelings than I do. Oh, Kaya, oh, baby. You got to know, I would never let anything happen to you. -You believe me? -I believe you. Okay. Jerome... I'm sorry, baby. God damn, it's good to see your face. -Jump in! -Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. All right. -How'd it go? -We need to hurry. -All right. Lay it on me. -In the basement, six hallways down. Two lefts, two rights. Saw four, maybe five guys on the way out. Got it. You ready, bro? -Let's go. -Cool. All right. Back to my place. Y'all be safe there. All right. Listen, before we go in here, I need to know you got my back in here. I'm here, right? -You got any combat experience? -Mnh-mnh. Stay close to me. Stay off the wall. Watch my back. Cover your corners. -You got it? -Got you. Do I got any combat experience? Bitch, who the fuck you think sold you these guns? What's that? Oh, shit. Okay, then. I'm going to stay right behind him. Listen, they probably heard that shit, so they're going to be coming. We need to move fast and silent. Man, just think of it as a big baseball bat or some shit. A baseball bat. Really? -You got a fucking problem, man? -I don't got a problem. I was just thinking more like guns blazing, I mean, like a superhero-type entry, you know what I mean? This ain't no superhero shit. All right. Whatever. Come on. Come on. Let's go. I had him. Don't worry about it, bro. Put the fucking gun down, kid. -Put the fucking gun down, kid. -Fuck you. I think we've drawn this out long enough. You know, I was planning to make you suffer so much fucking more! Yeah. What do you know? Your fucking friends are here to save you. So fucking precious. Shit! -Ohh! -Raj! Your homey ain't here to help you now, huh? Raj! Youse fucked with the wrong family. Yo, watch where you pointing that shit at, boy! Yo, he just really saved my life, man. Good work, cuz! Yo, this shit ain't nothing like video games. It's on a whole 'nother motherfucking level! -God damn! -Shut the fuck up, Rell. -We're still in this shit. -Yo, but -- but -- but is it me, or did I just save your life, though? 'Cause you would have been dead as shit if I ain't bust that motherfucker like Rambo. We got to keep it moving, man. -You niggas ready? -I'm ready. Come on. You going to fucking die. Delta, Delta, Charlie, oh-200 klicks. -We in this bitch! -Dawg, dawg, listen, I appreciate you saving my life, but you need to shut the fuck -- Aah. Shit. You -- You must be Poncho, huh? Fuck you! Listen, on the count of three, we going to bust down this door and go get my brother. -Y'all ready? -Let's do this. Yeah. One, two... three. Right, no fucking around! It's time to fucking die! Told you niggas this shit would happen! Fuck! You ain't going to do shit, bitch. You're right. I won't. But I will. For O.T., fucker. God damn it. Motherfuckers. I'm so glad all this is over. Mm. Me, too. Mm. Good night, everybody. I'm going to bed. -Good night. -Good night. Good night, baby. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Oop-oop! -Hook you up, little bro. -Couple cold ones. -Yes. -Thank you. -Yeah. -Look, guys, I'm trying to tell you, this bullet hole about to get me so much pussy, yo. Ugh. Oh, my God, Rell. You don't need no more baby moms to hush. I'm still surprised you got one. Man, fuck out of here. I get 10 times more bitches you get. Yeah, 10 times zero, which is still zero. Oh! Are you teaming up with this nigga now? Okay. I should have left your ass in that warehouse. That's what I should have did. No, for real, though, baby bro. -You saved my life, man. -Hey, man. Couldn't have done it without these two. Hell of a plan, Aminah. Great plan. Yeah. It was good. So sorry I had to string you along the way I did. I should have told you something sooner, but I -- I'm sorry. I'm just sorry. I mean, if you would have, it wouldn't have worked. I mean, it's something I feel bad about. You got us out of a mess that I put us in. I should be apologizing to you. To O.T., Denise, -and Raj. -Raj. And to our family sticking together through all the highs. And always coming out on top. Mm. Aminah, I've been in love with you since the day I met you, and you've been holding me down no matter what. You deserve the best, and I'm going to give it to you. Will you marry me? Yes. You got me. -And I love you. -I love you, too. Y'all see that? Rome, what the fuck is that? What? I'm still broke. The money ain't come in just yet. Like, besides, if you got love, you don't need money, right? Whoo! This shit got me fucking hype! Time to turn the fuck up! This guy is a fool. Look at him. He can't even walk. Shit is fucked up. Matter of fact, ain't the -- Ain't the Phillies playing right now, anyway? -Bro? -Yo! Yo! Oh, shit! That's my shit! God damn, kids! -So triflin'. -Shit, yo. Bro, what the fuck, bro? Marco, stay here. Marco. -Speak to me. -It's Dominic. I'm so sorry. It's a mess in there.
