- Hey, you got everything? - Yeah, yeah. - Wait a minute, I hear something. Watch it, he's coming. Move, move! - Okay, okay, I'm right behind you, be quiet. - What's the matter with the lights? Why aren't they on? Katherine! Geez, Katherine! Hello? - Surprise! Happy Birthday! ♪ I've got sunshine ♪ On a cloudy day ♪ When it's cold outside ♪ I've got the month of May ♪ I guess you'll say ♪ What can make me feel this way ♪ My girl, my girl, my girl ♪ Talkin' bout my girl, my girl ♪ I've got so much honey ♪ The bees envy me - Oh god. Oh are we hot? - Please! ♪ I guess you'll say ♪ What can make me feel this way ♪ My girl, my girl, my girl ♪ Talkin' bout my girl ♪ My girl, ooh - You see, it still fits. - Well, I had it altered, honey. - Oh. - Ow! - Sorry. - Hey guys! I'm having a better time tonight than I ever had in the '60s. I really am, the best time! - That's because she was divorced twice and had an annulment in the 60s. - Marty! - I'm sorry. - Those were the days, huh buddy? - That song was playing on the car radio when you brought me home from our first date, remember? - How could I forget? You won the world's record in the dash to the door. - Oh, you know how long I've known Katie? - How long? - Well, let's see. You're 28, so I guess I've known her four years less than you are. No, three years less than you are. No, I'm way off. If I'm 40, nevermind. I've known Katie for, well, a long time. Quite a while, yeah. ♪ I guess you'll say ♪ What can make me feel this way - I heard a good one today. - Go on. - What's black and brown and looks good on a lawyer? - What? - A doberman. - Happy 50 Mr. Martin. Tonight, you laugh. Tomorrow, you cry. - Great party, Mom. I love the costumes. - Oh. - He's not wearing a costume, that's the way he dresses. - Oh come on, Marty. They look like we did when we first met. - Young? - Come on. - Well I didn't drive a motorcycle. - Yeah, because you couldn't afford it. - Did I wear an earring? - You had long hair. - Not that long. - Marty, I love you. - I feel old. - Morning. If I invite the Perlmunners and the McBrides, they'll kill each other. - Might be the highlight of the wedding. - Sweetheart, aren't you going into the office today? - No, I'd rather stay in bed and suck on my covers. - Sounds like fun. Want some company? - Uh-oh. - Marty, even though our darling daughter's weeding is in nine months, we have to reserve the country club or the church right away. Or maybe we should have it here at home. What do you think? - Not good. - Why? - It's 130 over 90, you know what that means? - No hanky panky tonight. - Maybe I'm dying. - Why don't you use that exercise equipment that I bought for you? Really, get your heart pumping. - It's true, Mr. Martin. The only exercise I've seen you do in 12 years is chew. - Nobody asked you, Imelda. Where's my sausage? - No more sausage for you. Oat bran. - Since when? - I don't know nothing. - All that fat clogging up your arteries. Come on, honey, I want us to grow old together. - I want my sausage. - Don't forget you have lunch tody with Jennie at the club. Now, I've called Helmut, he's going to prepare a lovely platter of steamed vegetables for you. Come on, Marty, eat your oat bran. - Sorry I'm late, Daddy. - Mm, it's okay honey. Sorry I started without you. I'm starving. - Um, I brought my boss, Sam, from the office. - How you doin', Sam? - It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Slade. - Oh, uh. Mr. Martin, uh, Martin. Call me Martin. - I hope you don't mind, Martin, but I asked Jennie to bring me along. You've been um, well I've gotta admit, you've been sort of a hero of mine for years. As far as I'm concerned, you're the most progressive developer west of the Mississippi. - Oh please, sit down. - Ladies, would you like to see some menus? - Oh no menus, please, just two iced teas, lots of ice, extra lemon. Daddy, Sam's really taken me under her wing at the paper. I mean, she is the best business reporter on the entire staff. You know, when Mrs. Baldazano sent me over there, I didn't know who they'd assign me to, and quite frankly, the editor, Mr. Shapiro, didn't seem to want to have anything to do with me. But I think maybe Sam felt a little sorry for me, and she said I can intern with her. I'm even getting credit for this at school. She's really teaching me to go after what I want. I mean, that's what you have to do if you're gonna be a reporter, you know, to get that exclusive. And I couldn't believe that she knows everything about you. How you were the oldest of 11 kids, that you were poor and worked your way through school busing tables at Luigi's. She even knew that you graduated Magna Cum Laude, and that you were written up in Who's Who Under 40 when you were 30. I mean, she really does her homework. You know what's so weird, Dad? Sam went to Stanford, too. Just like you. She even knows that crazy professor, Mr. Schuldenfry. I guess that's a consequence. You were just meant to be. I mean, here we are, here she is, knowing more about you that I do. It's amazing. Anyway, she's doing a series of articles on self-made men, and she'd like to do a story on you. I know how you feel about interviews, Dad, but she insisted on meeting you anyway. - Oh. I'm sorry, Sam, but I. Never give interviews. - It's a amazing to me that after all my husbands, I only chose to have one child, and this is it. - I just hate eating without Marty. He's been working so hard lately. - I think I just had a nervous breakdown. That explains it. - It? - What we just did. I mean, some guys have a breakdown, and like, they flash at a supermarket, or they run out onto a football field in a dress, and uh, jiggle around in the middle of the Superbowl. Me, I. I. - Made incredible love. - Right. Oh uh, look uh, this isn't me. I mean, I don't do things like this. Other people do. Well then, how did I get to be other people? Hey, can I use your phone? I always call when I'm late for dinner. - That's very thoughtful. - I can't do this in front of you. - I'll go make some coffee. Do you always dress for coffee? - I really shouldn't be here. - Oh Martin, why don't you just relax? - I can't relax, I'm married. I really have to go, I'm so sorry. - Have you ever done it with hot oil? - Uh, goodbye Sam, I think both of us should forget that this ever happened. How, how, how hot? - Come on Lisa, help me out here. That's too many letters. Hi, sweetheart. - Sorry I'm late. - You must be tired. Okay look, let's just forget that one, all right? What about a six letter word that means deception? Affair, yeah, perfect. Very good. Look Lisa, what if I seat the Watzkis at your table? Well what did your mother ever to do the Watzkis? - I'm gonna take a shower. - Good morning, sexy. - Good morning, sexy! Thanks, Imelda. - Good morning, Mr. Martin. - Morning. I better run. - Honey, marmalade. Marmalade all over your tie. - I'll clean it up at the office. - Aren't you gonna eat anything? - I'm not hungry. I've got a nine o'clock meeting with the Justice twins. - Bye! - We gotta hurry. I have no time. Big meeting. At the office. 11 o'clock, with the Justice twins. - Martin, put your pants on. - Where we goin'? - You're going to work? - I am? Why? - Because I'm tired. - You're never tired. - I'm tired of this. This catching you between breakfast and meetings and dinner and bed time. - Oh, it's just, honey, it's been a very busy time for me. I'm sure next month, I'll have a lot more time-- - No, I'm not waiting until next month, Martin. Get dressed. - Sam. Sam, you knew that I was married when we met. Could you throw me my socks, please? - One is green and one is blue, great. They don't match. Look Martin, I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore. I'm sick of all the lies and sneaking around. I know you don't wanna hurt anyone, but this way you're hurting everyone. - Sugar, you don't understand. Katherine and I were married for 25 years. 25 years, she'd fall apart without me. She'd just shrivel up. - She'll survive. A year from now, she'll be thanking you for giving her the freedom to come out of her cocoon. Martin. Love is letting the caterpillar turn into a butterfly. - Oh. Did you just make that up? - No, I'm serious. - Sam, I can't do it. She built her whole life around me. - Give the woman some credit, please. Your relationship ended years ago. You know, the two of you have only been hanging on because it's all you know how to do. If you're not happy, she's probably not either. - What are you talking about? Katherine is very happy with me. - If that's what you wanna believe, fine. - I don't know. I don't know. - Martin, it's her or me. Her or me. Make your choice. - Where are you? - The doctor just found out who killed her. - Are they in Hawaii yet? - No. - Oh, you're just gettin' to the good part. - Have you made a choice, Mr. Slade? - Yes, um. Yes, we'd like one spaghetti arrabiata and a linguini marinara, couple of ensalada verdes with the dressing on the side, and some fried zucchini. No, uh. We'll have some creamed spinach. No, um, steamed spinach. - Very good, sir. - Do you know it has been such a long time since you and I had dinner together? What's the occasion? - Us. You and me. - Marty. That deserves a toast. To us. Is anything wrong? - Katherine. - You know, I miss you calling me Katie. - Ensalada verde. - Thank you. - Dressing on the side. - Why do you have to look so beautiful tonight? We shouldn't have come here. I made a mistake, waiter! - Don't be ridiculous, I'm having a wonderful time. - I'm suffocating. - Oh, well you know we'll get them to turn down the fire. Waiter! - No, no. - Excuse me. - No please, this is all wrong, let's go. Waiter! - What are you doing? I don't understand, Marty. - Check please. This is too difficult. I don't know how to do it. - Do what? - I'm just not happy, and if I'm not happy, you're probably not happy. - I'm happy. - I knew you'd say that. Look, Katherine. I want out. - Out? Of what? - Our marriage. Don't, don't, don't worry. Soon you'll be a month. - Moth? - Butterfly, I meant butterfly. - What are you talking about? - In a year, you'll thank me, you'll be free. - But I don't want to be free. I'm, Marty. What have I done? - Nothing, you haven't done anything. You've been wonderful. - If I've been so wonderful, why are you leaving? - Look, Katherine, Katherine, it's not you, it's me. I feel smothered, I need my space. I don't know what's happening to me. I wake up in the morning, and-- - What's her name? - What are you talking about? - Who is she? - Who? - Marty, please, don't lie to me. - Samantha. Samantha Laurel. - Where did you meet her? - Mutual friend. - Who? - Jennie, she's-- - Jennie. Our daughter, Jennie? - Yeah, she's interning for her at the paper. Sam's the top business reporter on the-- - Sam. You call her Sam. - Well, yeah, yeah, but she calls herself Sam. - How old is Sam? - What difference does that make? - She's young. - Well, I mean, she's younger than me, if that's what you mean. - Jennie's 21, is she younger than Jennie? - Of course not. She's 27. - Is there something wrong with the salad? - Yes. Yes, he doesn't like it. It's too old, it's too wilted, it is too brown around the edges, just like me. A moth! Oh my god! Oh, Marty. Marty. Now what? Give me a break! Oh great. Damn you! Oh, damn you, you son of a bitch! My god, why? Ah! Damn. - Mom, it's been a week, let me in, please! - Go away. - I didn't do it on purpose. When's Dad getting back from Texas? - Today, I think. Who cares? - What's all this? - She opens the door for junk. It's popcorn, extra butter, cheddar cheese balls, licorice, black only, beef jerky sticks, the kind that come in a jar, she loves those. And the vanilla chocolate bars, but only if they've been in the freezer. Watch. Mrs. Katherine? I have chocolate. - Mom. - Bless this immense project, dear Lord, and bless the man who will build it. - Bless his truth, his honesty, and his family. - Amen. - Amen. Jennie, oh what a pleasant surprise. You've heard me talk about the Justice twins. This is Warren Justice and his brother Waylen Justice. This is my daughter, Jennie. Real pleased to meet you. - Daddy, I really need to talk to you. - Well, when a man's family calls-- - You go on ahead now, we understand. - We do, we do. - Thank you, excuse me. - Pleasure. Hope to see you again. - Jennie, what are you doing here? I'm in the middle of a meeting. - Oh, I'm sorry. I should've known your work is far more important to you than your family. - Jennie, Jennie! Come here, sit down. Did your mother send you here? - She's not talking to me. - Well tell her it wasn't your fault. - Why don't you tell her? Look Dad, Sam's gonna leave you just as soon as she can find someone who can do more for her than you can. - You don't know her like I do, Jennie. We love each other. - That's what you used to say about Mom. - This has nothing to do with Mom. - Yeah, I know what this has to do with. - Jennie, it's me. Now I know it's hard for you to understand, you're 21, you're a baby. I'm 50, your whole life is ahead of you. I don't know what I have. It's all gone by so fast. Sam is a second chance for me. She's magic, she's-- - Have a good lunch, Dad. Watch your cholesterol, though. Sam's not gonna like it very much when your arteries harden. - Jennie. Don't. - Don't what? - Don't wipe with the diaper until you have a steady flow of water to buffer it. - You better do it. I want a cigarette. - That's a disgusting habit. - Martin, why do you clean your own car? - Because I do it better than anyone else. Tomorrow I'll get a garage. There's too much dust around here. So what's your day like? - Mm, I'm interviewing the owner of ZZY Computers. - Ah. - How about you? - Meetings. And lunch with Will Barker. - Let me check your tie before you go. - Why? - Because I don't think turquoise and chartreuse really work, do you? - Look, I'm colorblind, leave me alone. - Tell you what. I'll drive you to the office, and after my interview, I'll see if I can find a garage. How about that? - That would be great. - This Will Barker you're having lunch with isn't the Will Barker, the billionaire hermit from Utah? - Oh, Will isn't a hermit, he just doesn't like the press. - Honey, have I ever asked you for a favor? - No, and don't ask this one. - Martin, if I got an exclusive with Barker, I would get my own weekly column like that. - Sam, I can't. Will and I are old friends. I knew him in school before he made his first million and got weird. - Well that's even better, he'll listen to you. - Honey, don't put me on the spot. Will never. - Talks to the press? - How is she? Is she all right? - She's switched from sugar to starch. I have your lunch, Mrs. Katherine. Mesquite cheddar potato chips and an extra cheese pizza. - And for dessert, I have a list of divorce lawyers. All of them killers. What happened to your face? - Pimples. I haven't had pimples since Kenny Chirelli took me to the junior prom. - I know a good dermatologist. - So do I. Hey, give me that cupcake. - I can't actually believe you're putting this junk into your body. - Nobody wants my body. - Don't! - Just one little piece, one bite. - Katie, get a grip. Get a grip, come on, get outta bed. - I don't wanna get out of bed, Lisa. - Move your legs, walk around. You trust me, right? - Yes. - You have to do something for yourself. It's been a month. It's time for action. We'll call for a facial, and then I want you to talk to my psychiatrist. - No. - Why not? - Because, I don't wanna pay a professional to tell me what a failure I am. I already know that. - Katherine, you're not a failure. You're angry, and you're taking it out on you. Come on, where's your spunk? Where's your fight, honey, come on? - Sam took 'em. Oh gosh, my husband was stolen by a woman named Sam. Not a Monique, not a Tiffany, but a Sam. - Forget Sam! Forget Martin! Forget the marriage! - Drop dead! - Don't waste that on me, kiddo. Use it. Get mad, and then get even. - How do I do that? - There are ways. Many ways. She'll be back soon. - You sure? - Positive. - How are you so sure? Lisa, let's not do this. - Relax, relax, I called her paper. I told them I was her mother, everybody has a mother, they told me she'd be home by four. This is the address. - All right. - All right? Go back in the car. - You know, I probably lost my mind, but I like this. - Get in the car. - Right. - Okay. Yeah, yeah. Get down, stay down! Down! Excuse me, honey? Excuse me! - Yes? - Would happen to know who belongs to this thing here or that car behind me? - Yeah, a friend of mine owns this thing here. - Oh they do? Well that's fine, that's just fine. Do you think you might be able to get the keys so you could move it? Move it up just a tad? - Uh, well the keys are upstairs, but my friend doesn't like anyone else driving his car. - Well, yes. Yes, indeed, I certainly understand that. But you see, honey, I'm as stuck as a bear's butt in a beehive, now if I go ahead on and try to move my little vehicle, I might just hurt your friend's car. Badly. - All right, all right. I'll go get the keys, don't move, okay? - Don't you worry, I wouldn't move at all. I'm gonna stand here and be as still as slime on a slug. - Slime on a slug? - I'm from New York, what do you want? It's all I could think of. - Okay here, take these, take these hurry. - All right, hurry up. - Okay, yeah, yeah, right. Okay. - Under the wheel. - Yep, way under. - All right, here we go. - That's beautiful, yeah, okay. - Give me some of that. - Yeah. - Say, what did you think of Sam in person? - Well, if young, gorgeous, and slender is your style, she's okay. - I don't think it's so fabulous. - Yeah right. - Get in the car. - Right, right, right. - And stay down this time, will ya? - All clear, Joe! - Oh no. No, oh no. Oh, on no! - Bye bye, you are a sugar. - I'm gonna be sick. Oh, oh. Wait, wait! Wait, no! - No, no! No, no, no! Uh, no, oh no, no. Oh bunny, oh bunny! Oh no! No! - How lucky can you get? - Divine providence, darling. - Are you all right? Are you all right? - Aren't you gonna ask if I'm all right? - I told you not to move the car! Oh, it'll be okay. Oh, it'll be, oh bunny, it's gonna be okay. Oh no, no. I feel terrible that I screamed at you about the car. - Where are we going? - I got a surprise for you. There's two steps, one, two. That's it. Now, the last step, I wanna make it up to you because I lost my temper the other day, okay? Okay. Well? What do you think? Do you like it? - Oh Martin. Oh, I love it, our own place. - Nothing of your past and nothing of mine. A brand new start. Let's toast to that. - I love you. - Mm, I saved the best for last. - What, what? - The most spectacular view in town. You press the button. - Oh, this is great. - What the? - Is this a joke, honey? - My wife, she's lost her mind. Katherine, pick up! I know you're there. I have had it with your childish pranks, and I've had it with you! - Everything okay? - Okay, to record your message, press message button and record button simultaneously. I can do that. You have reached the office of Martin Slade. Entrepreneur and home wrecker. If you're a woman over 27, don't leave a message because he will not call you back or even acknowledge that you exist. Oh yeah well look, I'm very excited about this. This is gonna be a real surprise. You know, I found it myself. I went shopping for it. - You went shopping? - Uh-huh, I did, I went shopping. I'm sure I left it in the office. Oh yeah, I knew I left it here. - What is it? - Here, here open it up. I hope you like it. What do you think? - Oh Martin. Oh, they're beautiful. - Do you like them? - Yes, oh, Martin. Oh, you're so sweet. - You feel so good. What are you doing? - Oh, well. - What are you doing? - Well we, we've done it in the car, we've done it on the beach, but we've never done it in your office, so. - Oh honey, you feel so good. Oh yes. - I bet you've never done this with your wife, have you? - No, never, never, never. Well, after months of hard work, the Hallelujah Mall is ready to go forward. - Before we sign this contract, I think we should all remember that beyond the millions of dollars involved, there is something more important. The moral fiber of America. For if we cannot find it in our shopping malls-- - Where can it be found? - Amen, brother. - Amen. - Okay, Mr. Hot Pants. Get a load of this. - Oh Martin. - What are you doing? - Well? - What are you doing? - Well, we've done it in the car, we've done it on the beach, but um-- It's uh, it's just a joke. It feels so good. Would you turn off the intercom? The intercom! Turn off the intercom! Turn off the intercom! It's, it's, it's a joke, it's nothing. Would you turn off the intercom! Get the boxes off! No, it's, it's, it's okay. - There's a time and a place for everything. - No, no. - I think that we will do business elsewhere, sir. Thank you very much. - No, no, no. It's just a, please. Oh, baby, oh! That's it, the gloves are off. - Oh! - Don't waste your time. None of the keys work anymore. Mr. Slade's had the locks changed. - Who are you? - Ernie Case. Maybe you remember me from that wonderful Christmas party you gave last year. I won the turkey. - Oh, congratulations. What are you doing here? - I'm supposed to prevent trespassing. - Trespassing? Give me the keys, Ernie. - No can do. - Ernie, this is my house. - Mr. Slade plans to tear it down, build a parking lot. - A parking lot? Ernie, give me the keys, or I'm gonna break in right now. - Don't try any funny stuff. I'm armed. - I don't believe this. I truly do not believe this. Wait a minute, where's my car? It was right here, where is my car? It was here, right here! Oh, Marty! - I'm sorry, Mrs. Slade. These accounts are all in your husband's name. And his attorneys, Leibowitz, Lipschitz, and McGregor, they filed all the proper documents. The funds are frozen until a decision is resolved. - What can I do? - Nothing without a very good attorney. - Maybe this isn't the best time to bring this up. But your credit cards, are they in your name? - Of course. Good, good. Very good. Let's go. Thank you. You know, with Harvey, my first husband, they were what you called spouse's cards. So as soon as he contacted all the companies, my credit stopped, forever. - Yep, so has mine. Excuse me, please. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Slade, you can't go in. - Get out of my way. - I tried to stop her, Mr. Slade. - Martin. - I'm in the middle of a meeting. - I want my house and my car and my dog. - That's my house and it's my car, and I kidnapped the dog. - You bastard. - How dare you talk to me like that after what you've done! - What I've done? What have you done, you leave me! For some cheap little-- - Sam is not cheap. - You left her for a guy? - Shut up! - I want my keys! - I want a divorce! - So do I! - Get yourself a lawyer! - You bet! - What profession did you give up in order to become Mrs. Slade? - None. I bet that's inconceivable for a person like you, a young, professional woman, but I really never thought much about a career. I always wanted to fall in love with a wonderful man and get married and have a family. And that's what I did. - That's not going to help us. Okay, let's try another angle. In what way do you think you were instrumental in advancing your husband's career? - Well. I gave parties. - You gave parties. - See Marty has never been comfortable with people, he's just one of those awkward guys and I sort of, well, basically, I took charge of our social life, and I gave parties so he would meet the right people. - Tell me more. - Well, when we met, Marty was, oh, he was full of drive and ambition, but he wore polyester. I didn't come from money, but I knew not to wear polyester. - Doesn't breathe. - Exactly. - So you gave parties. - Mm-hm. I read the business pages and the society columns, and I made lists of people who Marty should meet in order to get ahead, and I invited them. In the beginning, hardly any of them came, but still, I gave a dinner party for 20, four would show up. But those four would have a great time, they'd tell their friends, then maybe 10 would come, and then pretty soon, everybody did. - In other words, you took an unsophisticated lout from the no list to the A list, spent the best years of your life building him into something only to have him abandon you in your twilight years. - Right. Except for the twilight years part. - Don't worry. We're going to get you everything that's rightfully yours. - I don't want what's rightfully mine, I want what's his. - Well, let's start by putting you back in your house. I'll call you tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow? What about tonight? - Give me a break. I'm not a 7-Eleven. - Hi, this is Lisa. I'm out of town until tomorrow. Only my bodyguard and vicious dog are here. Leave your name and number, and I'll call you tomorrow. - Lisa, where are you? Guess who? - Mrs. Katherine, what are you doing here? - I suppose you noticed the armed guard at the house this morning. - As soon as I saw the gun, I turn around and come home. Why, Mr. Martin? - Yes, I need a favor from you. - You name it, you got it. - Well, I find myself with no credit cards and no cash, and well, I was wondering, may I stay in your guest room this evening? - Oh boy, Imelda, I had no idea you took three buses to get here every morning. - And come back every night. - I mean, the transportation system-- - Stinks! - Sophie! - Hey, I got it. - Great, great. - Here you go. - Come on, come on, sweetheart. - Got the keys, the car, the dog, and and order. You may remain on the premises until all of this is resolved. - What's the catch? - Nothing major. Mr. Slade will pay only 50% of the expenses. You'll have to pay the rest. - Wait a minute, the pool man, the gardener, the maintenance. - The housekeeper. - I've gotta run. I've got a deposition. - But how am I supposed to pay for all this? - This may sound ridiculous, but have you ever thought of getting a job? - Excuse me? - Work. - No. - Well think about it. Caio. - Aren't we going in? - I'm over 40, I have no experience, no job skills, no college degree. All I have to do is find a job. This oughta be a snap. Assistant marketing manager. - Sounds good. - No, bilingual, Japanese-English. Horse trainer, geez. - I let myself in. Mom, it's time we made up. I'm sorry. I've kicked myself a thousand times. What could I do? She's my boss, she wanted to do a story. - Well you can stop kicking yourself. Save a few for your father. And next time, bring groceries. I can't eat flowers. - Your mother needs a job, Miss Jennie. - A job. But you don't know how to do anything. - Oh thanks for the vote of confidence. Excellent opportunity for mature, elegant person with talent for dealing with the public. No experience required. - Yeah, circle that one. - Jean-Pierre House of Beauty. How may I help you? A manicure? Yes, we have an opening at four. Good, what is the name please? R-U-S-T-Y, Rusty. See you then. Hello. - Hello, is Shep ready? - Shep? Let me check the computer. - He's the fabulous sheepdog. - Here he is, Shep, number 22. A P-cut. - P-cut? - Well, everything here is computerized, it's very efficient. Every cut has its own code, so when the dog arrives, I simply key in the code, and the groomers do the rest. - Very impressive. That's my baby's voice. Sheppy, I'm here! Sheppy! What have you done to him? What happened to all his beautiful hair? He's a sheepdog, and now he looks like a, a, a poodle! - Oh, I'm sorry don't cry! Listen, there are so many codes for me to remember, please forgive me. It'll grow back. Five hours. I lasted five hours on my first job. - So you'll find something else. - Another round, ladies? - Sure. Why not? - Not for me, thanks. I gotta meet Steve in town. We're checkin' out this band for the wedding. The Blood Clots. - Okay. - Well you don't have to leave. - Well I'm certainly not staying in a bar by myself, Jen. - Mom, you're a grown up. This is a perfectly respectable place. - What if somebody comes over, you know, and tries to pick me up? - Well, if you like him-- - Jennie. - Mom, you gotta face the fact that you're, you know, well, single again. I mean, you can either hide under a rock or get out there and face the world. - I think I'll hide under a rock. - Okay, well, take these just in case. - What are you handing me? Condoms? - Yeah. - Would you please put these away before everybody sees? - Mom, what's the big deal? - What are you doing with these, anyway? - Give me a break. What do you think Steve and I do? Sit around and read Shakespeare to each other? - I don't wanna hear about your sex life, and I can just tell you, I have no use for these things. - Why, are you gonna become a nun? Look, take them, you never know. - I know. Please. - Look, better safe than sorry, okay. - I don't want them. - I'm putting them in your purse. - I don't need them. - Have another drink and relax. You're a big girl. I'll call you at home later. Bye. - Good bye. - Uh, excuse me, I wasn't trying to eves drop, but it was kind of hard not to. I'll look out for you. If anybody bothers you, I'll be over here in a sec. Here's the other one with the umbrella. - Thank you. - Sweetheart, I don't know how the heck you can concentrate with that racket going on. - You gotta keep up with the times, Martin. - Well, it's sort of a catchy beat. Like cows in heat. Thank you. Hey, that's Will Barker. And there's Dalton and Rebecca. What are you doing? - The key to a successful party is an interesting mix of people with a great deal in common. - That's true, who's having a party? - Well, I think it's time we entertain, don't you? Oh here. I put this list together. What do you think? - Oh, these people have a lot in common. They're all stinking rich and they hate each other. - Martin, how can you talk that way about your friends? - Darling, these people aren't my friends, they're business acquaintances. My friends are guys I hang out with, play poker with, go to a ball game with. People nobody would be interested in reading about. - No honey, you're missing the point. There are friends, and there are friends. I'm talking about the right friends. - You're kidding, aren't you? - Am I laughing? - I left my husband. He didn't like my hair. - Where do you get it done? - House of Flame. - I go there, too. - Yeah? - Yes. - Redheads are their specialty. - Closing time. - Goodnight, Joe. - Night, Sue. - Good luck. - Thank you, you too. - Yeah. - Thanks for watching out for me. Not that I needed it. No one, but no one was the least bit interested. - No, that's not true. - It is true. - You're a beautiful, classy lady. But a guy can tell when a woman wants to be alone. - You're very sweet. Oh-- - Joe. - Joe. Joe, the bartender. Set 'em up, Joe. - Ah, I hope you get a cab. - Oh, I really don't wanna go home. It's a big empty house. Your husband ever leave you, Joe. - No. - And then he left. - What happened next? - Nothing. End of story. - Why? - What do you mean? - That should just be the beginning. You're a smart, lovely lady, Katherine. Give yourself a chance. - And you're a very sweet person, Joe. Wow. - Would you like to invite me in? It's getting cold out here. - I know. Could we just kiss once more out here. Would that be okay? - Sure. - Hmm, so you wanna go in now? - Thank you. - No. - Really. - Thank you. If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me. - Yes, I do. Thank you again, Joe. Night. - Night. - Good morning, darling. - That hurts my eyes. - Depressed again? - Hungover. - Oh, I hope you weren't drinking alone. There's nothing as pathetic as a lonely drunken woman. - No, I wasn't. - Really? - Mm-mm. I found myself a friend. - You did? Good for you. How was he? - It wasn't like that, Lisa. - You're hopeless. This is Lisa Jarrett. I have left 30 messages on your damn machine, and this is 31, and it is the last. Please get back to me. I'm at 555-1366. - One of your boyfriends? - No. It's the caterer I'm using for the Woolrich party tonight. These people spent $50,000 to have me redo their house, and I'm throwing them a little affair as a thank you, but it's driving me crazy. Bundy Florist, this is Lisa Jarrett. Is this Bob? Hello, Bob. Bob, what happened to my centerpieces? Who died? I don't care who died, Bob. Just send me the flowers! Can you believe this? - Weedlers is the only reliable caterer in town. - Who? - Weedlers. And for flowers, you should've gone to Casablanca Florist. - Oh yeah. - Is the party outside? - Yeah. - Then you may need a tent, Lisa. Berkley's is good. And Ramone is the only person to call for valet parking. - What's going on? - I have no idea! - What does she say? - Finally. Hi, everybody. - Oh, what's wrong? - What's the emergency? - Come in, come in. - Imelda, do you know what's going on? - You've gotta be kidding. - Ladies and gentlemen, I've gathered you all here to share a very special moment with me. - Is this when the body drops out of the closet? What? - I've gone into business. - Fabulous! - You did? - Oh my god! - Yes I have, I certainly have. What do you think? - It's great. - I think it's great, I'm so proud of you! - It's great Mom, I love that name Party Perfect. It's perfect. - Well, let's hope my parties are perfect. I'm so nervous, Imelda. This vampire party has got to work. If not, it's back to poodles. - Mom? Dad? Where is everyone? - Surprise! - Happy birthday! - We can't give you the moon, Lee. These figures on future income lost are laughable. - My client is attempting to begin a career. One denied her by the master-slave relationship which your client established as his definition of marriage. - Master-slave? We're talking about our marriage. We're not talking about the Civil War. - I must insist on your total silence, Mr. Slade. - My client, as the vice-president of two of your companies, Liebowitz, received a sizable annual income. With a break up of the marriage, she has also lost these titles, ditto the income. - That's ridiculous that was done strictly for tax purposes. It was all on paper. Katherine never received a cent. - Let us do the talking, please. - Marty's right, I never received any of that money. - See? - And if we can have that statement in writing, my client will gladly abandon all her claim to the monies in question. Right after I copy the IRS. - How could you do this to me? - I could ask you that same question. So, are we agreed? That I will be getting some of my future income lost in the present? - We didn't say-- - Okay. - Well, it's probably too late to suggest this, but in the future, Mr. Slade, could you please-- - Keep my big mouth shut? - Well, that's not the way a lawyer might phrase it, but you've captured the essence. - Jennie. I'm sorry I'm late, I was with Will Barker, an old friend of your father's. I'm doing a story on him, he says he knows you. - Yeah, he's weird. So why'd you ask me here, Sam? - Look, Jennie. I didn't break up your parents' marriage. I'm sorry that what happened happened. I wanted to see you today because I was hoping we could start again. - I don't think so, Sam. - Okay, look. The truth is, you're the best damn assistant I ever had, and I'm completely lost without you. - Did you lose your office keys again? - Yeah. Three sets. - You're so predictable. - The wedding's in two months, right? - Yeah. - Where you gonna have it, do you know yet? Oh, have you picked a gown? Who's designing it? Do you have the addresses of your father's friends? - Run that one by me again. - Oh, well your father's been begging me to throw a party. - Daddy, really? - Yeah, well anything he wants is okay with me, you know. I just like to make it sort of a surprise, so I can't really ask him for his usual guest list, and I was wondering if maybe you could help me out? - Yeah, I don't see why not, I mean, well it is your first party, right? And you want it to be perfect. - You read my mind.- - Yeah, I think I know exactly what you need. - Now, if you reformat the modem hook up of your hard disk, you won't need your menus on the floppy. - I see. Party Perfect. Hi Charlie. No, sorry, we're completely booked that day. How about the third? Of course, I make my special salsa just for you. Okay, you got yourself a deal. - You did what? - I suggested that Sam phone this little company I know to plan her party perfect. Get it? - Jennie, this may be a ridiculous question, but why? - Think about it. It's her most important party. All of Daddy's friends will be there, and she wants your company to do all the planning. I told her to call at eight and ask for Mademoiselle Yvonne. - What? - Oh my god, it's her. - No. - Pick it up! - I don't want to. - Please! - I don't know. - Mom. - Who am I? - French, French. - Hello? Party Perfect. Oui, she did say to me that you would be calling. - So you understand what I want? - Oh, more than that, I know what you need. - Great. Of course you know that this is all strictly confidential. I want the guests to think that I'm responsible for every detail. - Think of me as your priest. This is a confessional, and parties are our religion. - Perfect. - More than perfect. - Oh you look so charmed. - Oh Rebecca, you're so slim! That watermelon diet again? I bet. Will Barker, how are you? God the story came out fabulous. - You old son of a gun. - Dalton! Oh, we read your last novel, and it was so naughty, we read it twice. - It's fabulous. - Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, before we go in, I'd just like to say that I have truly been looking forward to this night for weeks, and I've thrown myself into every detail of this party because tonight isn't just a party, it's my way of saying to Martin's friends that you're my friends, too, and I hope tonight shows you just what I think of you. - So let's have a sensational time. This is some kind of a mistake, isn't it? We're in the wrong place. You actually planned this? - No, I didn't! - You've been working on this for weeks! - No, I lied, okay? Party Perfect did it, and if I could-- - Party Perfect? - Yes, I will sue her, I will destroy her reputation-- - How could you have hired Katherine's company? - Katherine's company? Katherine has a company, since when? - Ever since I left her! - All right, let's go. We gotta get out of here. - No matter what you do, I'm the one one wants, so there! - Oh Lisa, maybe this is not such a good idea. - Please, calm down. Listen, I wouldn't tell my own mother this. - What? - You know that spa I go to every once in a while? - Yes. - This is the spa. - Really? Really? - Yes. Honey, a little nip and tuck. It's always better than a trip to Europe. - Lisa you are something. - Excuse me, Mrs. Slade? The doctor will see you now. - Oh Lisa. - Relax. Peter is fabulous. Great hands. Go for it, go for it. - Okay, okay. - Go on. - I'm going. - Hi. Dr. Foley. - Hello. - Katherine. Suits you. So, what can I do for you? - Well, my friend Lisa Jarrett, who recommended you, says you should see me because I could look, well, you know, better. - Well, I don't know about that. - What do you mean? - You have beautiful bones, and your skin is tight. I don't think you need to do anything at all. - Yeah, but the lines around my eyes, doctor look. See, when I, they're awful. - Well, that's charming. I mean, you don't wanna look like some vacuous co-ed, do you? - No, I don't wanna look like a vacuous co-ed. - Do you mind if I ask you something personal? - Um, no. - Have you had any major changes in your life lately? - Yes. My husband left. - Shook your confidence a little bit. - Mm. - Yeah. Well. Personally, I think he's an idiot. - Yeah, well I agree. Uh, listen doctor, is there anything that you would recommend that I could do for myself? - Yes, I recommend that you go out and have dinner with me tonight. - What? - If you were my patient, that would be highly unethical, so that's another good reason I don't take your case. - Dr. Foley, I-- - Call me Peter. - Peter. - Nice purse. - Oh. Yeah well, it's just that um, my daughter gave me some, I never use them, but I mean, I meant, I never met anyone yet to use them with so far, until now. But just in case you don't have any, there are two in my purse. - Two what? - Condoms. Condoms are in my purse. - Well, that's very responsible of your daughter. - Peter. - Hm? - Um, my husband was the first, and um, he's the only, you understand what I'm trying to say? - Yeah. - Because I feel sort of. - Okay, okay. - Do you know this guy? - She certainly does, I happen to be her husband. - Used to be my husband. - And who the heck are you? - I'm Katherine's friend, Peter Foley. - You know, you're gonna have to get Sam to clean the rest of this. - Yeah, she's supposed to meet me here. She's a little late. An hour. - Well, nice meeting you. - No more, no, no, no. No more singing, no more. - Well, my compliments to the chef. - You're the one who cooked dinner. - Well, no wonder it tastes so good. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I have to go. Now, the dishes are in the dishwasher, and the crystal has been hand washed and dried, and I guess you're all dying to discuss me, so goodbye. Jennifer, Steven, it's a pleasure. - We'll see you at our wedding next week, Peter. - You bet. - Bye. - Buh-bye. - I heard a good one. - Good what? - Joke. - Yeah? - What's brown and black and looks good on a lawyer? - A suit? - A doberman. What, you don't think that's funny? - Well, I had a doberman when I was a kid. Actually, they're very gentle dogs. It's just a bad rep. Good night, Katie. - Night, Peter. - Wow Mom, he's gorgeous. I mean, wait till Dad sees the two of you at the wedding. - He's not coming to the wedding. - Why? - Because he drives me nuts. Everything has to be in place. I mean, like his hair. He doesn't want it touched because he doesn't want it out of place. And he keeps picking things off me, Jennie, like I have fleas. - Excuse me. Girl talk, I'll be in the den. - So. Are you gonna keep seeing him? - Jen. You want the truth? I'm still in love with your dad. - Hm. I thought you said he was a liar and a cheat-- - And a bastard, and I wish I could turn him off like a bad re-run. Jennie, it makes no sense. - But Peter's handsome and smart and understanding. And he even does dishes. The man's perfect. - But he's not perfect for me. Your father is. I mean, it's perfect the way we laugh at the same stupid jokes. It's perfect how good he makes me feel just holding my hand. You know, sometimes two people are, they're supposed to be together, they belong. And they can fight, they can make mistakes, but no matter what, the two of them, together, are better than either one of them would ever be alone. - I'm not sure I understand. - Okay. Let me put it to you this way. In our den right now, is a very quiet guy with very long hair and an earring who's watching a superhero on TV. Okay? Now, of all the people in the entire universe, he's the one you're marrying on Saturday. Why? - Because I love him. - I rest my case. - Hello? - Hello, Martin. - Katherine? - I took a chance, I thought perhaps, you would still be working at the office, and can you talk? - Sure. - Good. Well, I need for you to please sign your life insurance policy. - Oh. - It expires tonight. So, as much as I hate to bother you, I was thinking-- - Well I'll be right over. - Good. I'll see you soon. - Okay. - Marty, let's not kid around. We're two mature adults. I know what I want. And I know what you want. I want you, and you want Sam. This is stupid, this such a totally stupid idea. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you for coming. - I've come to sign the papers. - What papers? - The insurance papers, I'm supposed to sign them. - Oh, those papers. Yes, well, they sent them to the wrong house. They were for the Finesteins next door. - The Finesteins? - You look tired. - I am. You look great. - Would you like some decaf? And I have five different kinds of leftover birthday cake. - Do you have any chocolate chocolate double fudge cake? - Oh yes. - Well, I'd like a small slice of that. - Come in. Would you like some whipped cream with that? - Sure, why not. The house looks great. So you've really made a go of your business, didn't you? Don't tell my lawyers, but I'm proud of you. - Hello? This is Mrs. Slade. Oh my god, it's Jennie. - What's wrong, is she all right? - Dr. Newman, to obstetrics. Dr. Newman, to obstetrics please. - Oh! - Jennie! Oh honey, you're all in once piece, sort of. - How could you let this happen to my little girl? - Dad, it's my fault, I was driving the cycle. - Why'd you let her drive it? - Take it easy, Marty. It's not his fault. - Oh, it's not his fault? Who got him the stupid bike in the first place, maybe it's your fault? - Why don't you grow up for a change, Marty? Look at 'em, they're fine, they're fine, be grateful. How are you? - Okay. - Oh, Mrs. Slade! All right! - Come over here. - You okay? - Yeah. - Thank god she's okay. - Puts things into perspective, doesn't it? - Remember when she was a baby? She was always into everything. - Always curious. - Even then, she was taking chances. - That, she learned from me. Morning. I had it set so that I wouldn't miss our day in court. - Oh, I forgot. We're getting divorced today. Look, about Sam. I know that it hasn't been easy for you being on your own with me having had someone. - Well, I've had someone, too. - You mean that little guy in the park? I know you had to have a male companion around. - He wasn't a companion, Marty. We were lovers. - What? You mean, you? Are you saying, you're telling me that you two. That you did it with-- - What difference does it make? - Well he took advantage of you! He knew your situation. He knew that you were vulnerable and that you were depressed and you were desperate. - Desperate? You egotistical moron. Did it ever occur to you that he might find me attractive and stimulating and sexy? - Yeah, he's a creep. - No, I'll tell you what he is. What he is is handsome, and brilliant, and witty, and incredible in bed. And don't ask me why, in spite of all that, here I am with you. - Yeah I don't want any details. I just wanna put my pants on, and I'll see you in court. - You bet! You bet! - Spiro versus Spiro. - Oh, Katherine. Hello, I don't think you two have met before. - Not face-to-face. She's always stood behind me when she was stabbing me in the back. - Greenwood versus Greenwood. - Excuse me, we're supposed to be next. I have a wedding rehearsal at three o'clock. - You don't waste any time, do you? - Our daughter's getting married. - Mazel tov. - We're the Greenwoods. - Not for long. - So, um, has Jennie decided on her wedding gown? - Yes, she's decided to wear mine. - That was a beautiful gown. - You looked beautiful in it. - Martin and I plan to have a simple wedding. - You didn't tell me you were planning to get married. - Well, we've just discussed it-- - Marty. - Nothing has been decided. - Is that what last night was about? - Last night? - Huh? One for the road? I should've known. - He was in the office last night. - I was. - You fell for that one, too. - This is just another one of your insipid tricks. - You don't believe me, ask him. - Martin? - I can explain. - Slade versus Slade. - That's us. - You slept with my fiance? - He's not your fiance. He is my husband, tramp! - Ooh! Oh, ooh, oh. - Oh, honey. - My nose is bleeding. - You hit him! - Last call to dinner, Slade versus Slade, you're up to bat. - Taxi! - We're late. - So what, it's only a rehearsal. - I didn't know you could do that. - There are a lot of things about me you don't know. Taxi! - Taxi! - Look Sam, I'm sorry I hit you. - I'm sorry you ducked. - I wish I was French. They're so civilized about these things. I mean, after all, you and I have had, well. We have shared very similar experiences, I'm sure. - I wouldn't agree. - I would. I can't stand the way he gets food all over himself when he eats. - You have to brush him off. - Uh-huh. And what about his color combination? - He's colorblind. - Are you colorblind? I'm colorblind. - I mean, why do you think I picked out his clothes for 25 years? I didn't want him to make a fool of himself in public. - Would you please? - And what about the way he steps all over you when you dance. - Two left feet. - Hey what do you thin he is, Fred Astaire or something? - I feel better, now that we're divorced. Don't you, Marty? - Oh yeah. Sure. Yeah. - Katie. - Frank! - You must be so excited. - I am. Listen, you gotta hurry and get a set. We're about to begin. - So, any special thoughts for Jennie on her wedding day? - Oh honey, Diane, please a little later. I'm just so nervous. - All right, all right. - Okay? - Okay, go. - Later, yeah. - She looks so beautiful. - Her mother wore that dress. - People, this is a very exciting day. It's my first wedding, so let's go for it. To get this rolling, Steve has written a little something. I really love it because it makes my job so easy. You're on, Steve. - Jennie, before I met you, I didn't know what love was. I didn't know what sharing was, I was just me. Now, I'm part of an us, and I've learned that that us is worth fighting for, no matter what happens. Is that us is a precious gift that we've been privileged to receive. Today, I say thank you, my sweet Jennie, for that gift of you. - Well, I hope we got that on video. Okay, let's get down to it. Do you, Jennifer, take this man, Steven Michael Jarrett, to be your husband, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? - I do. - Martin, I think I'm coming down with something. I wanna go home. - It's my daughter's wedding, I can't leave. With a little luck, there won't have to be another one. - You're completely ignoring me. You act totally different around Katherine, I can't stand it. - Sam, we were married forever, what did you expect? - I don't want you spending time with her. - Please, don't tell me who I can or can't see. Sam, you'll force me to make a choice you won't be very happy with. - Martin, don't threaten me. - You're right. I think I'll make a choice. - Good, can we go now? - No. You can, I'm staying. - For the rest of the evening, or what? - For as long as she'll have me. - You're kidding, right? What do you think, you can go from one woman to another? That's not the way it works, Martin. Pretty soon, you're gonna have to deal with the real problem, and you know what that is? It's you. Don't come home tonight. I'll be out of there by morning, okay? - Are we having fun yet? - Yes. - No more handshakes for you. - Couldn't have done it without you. Hey, that's us, sweetheart. - Let's go. - Harvey, what are you doing here? - Hey baby, congratulations. - My mother never liked him. She said his eyes were too watery. - Harvey, I'm so glad you could make it. - Katherine, I'm sorry about everything. - Katie, she looks beautiful. - Aw, thank you, Frank, I think she does, too. - Well, that's that. - Yeah. - I've been an idiot. - Don't expect an argument from me. - Think you can ever forgive me? - Well, let me think about it for a year or two. - Come dance. - May I have this dance? - Yes. Steve, I love what you said. - Yeah well, you know. - Mom, did you hear about the sale? - No honey, what sale? - My son just made a deal with Zap Inc. software. They are gonna market his computer game. What is it, honey? - Tele-bind Man. - Yes, and they want the exclusive rights for any other future ideas he may have in the future. Whadya think of that, Marty? - I think that's fabulous, son. I'm proud of you, congratulations. - Thanks, Dad. - Where's Sam? - She's gone. Didn't work out. - I see. Didn't work out for her, or didn't work out for you? - Didn't work out for me. - Ow! - Oh, sorry. Where's that perfect lover of yours? Why isn't he here? - It didn't work out, either. - Didn't work out for him, or didn't work out for you? - Didn't work out for me. Ow, Marty! - Sorry. You know, it's amazing. You think in 50 years I might've learned something about myself. Guess I'm still the same dope I was when I was a kid. Katherine, don't people ever change? - I'm sure. Yeah, we change. When things get so bad, you don't think you could possibly live through them, you have two choices. You either jump off a cliff or you change. - Katherine. Will you marry me? Again? - Oh, I thought it was arthritis. - Say yes, please. Because I don't know how long I can stay down here like this. Please, marry me, Katie! Well? - No. - No? - No? - No. - Ow! Ow, why not? I think I tore something. - I need time, Marty. - How much time? - I don't know how much time. It's been what, nine months. A lot's happened, and, oh, Marty. You know what I just realized? My life doesn't depend on you, it depends on me. - Have I blown it altogether, Katherine, or could we date sometime? - Oh I think we could date. - How about tonight? - I'm busy tonight. Maybe tomorrow? - Yeah? Wanna go to a movie or something? - Or something. - Hey, I heard a good one today. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. - How's your back? - I really think I tore something. Ow, ow. - Careful. - Wait, walk slower. - Okay. Is it that same spot on your left above your coccyx? - Yeah, I just need to sit down. - So what's the joke? - What joke? - You said you heard a good one today. - Oh yeah. What's the definition of a perfect lover? - I don't know, what? - Someone who makes love till four in the morning and then turns into a pizza.
