At Motex, we turn your off days on. - Well JC, what do you think? - What do I think about what? - About the commercial. - To tell the truth I don't know what to say. I guess it's too feminine. - Feminine? It's a commercial for a woman's sanitary napkin. What did you have in mind? A testimonial for Joe Namath? - Tell me Ms Hunter, do you consider what I just saw to be a great commercial? - It's Miss Hunter and the answer is no. I think it does the job. - I don't. Besides they'd never run that spot. It's too erotic. All the neighing and that girl on the horse, it's blatantly sexual. - A woman riding a horse. Come on now. Don't tell me you're so naive you don't know what they say about woman on horses? For God's sake, Jesus. - You ought to try it sometime, it might relieve you of that hostility. - How dare you! - Excuse me, I hate to bring it up now, but we have an October four air date and if this spot is dead, what do we run in it's place? - Well we can rerun Blue Sunday? - Yes we could, but I'm sure that wouldn't suit Miss Hunter would it? - It's your money. - You're damn right it is girly and I made it because I know what women want to be told. - I find that very difficult to believe. - Oh what do you find very difficult to believe? - That you can communicate with women at all, considering how very little you know about them. Goddammit Sam, I'm warning you, I'm getting sick and tired of that little lady telling me what to do with my product. - Believe me, Mr. Bigelow, if I weren't such a little lady I would tell you precisely to do with your product. Dinah! Okay. - David! David! David. David. David! I told you if this happened again we're through. - Well okay we're through. Listen I can explain, will you let me explain? I can explain this to you, if you just give me a chance to explain it. That's Candy. Candy remember, Bernie's friend? He called from Chicago, she's tapped, they threw her out of her apartment. - So you have to open a day camp for a bus stop starlet? - Would you stop being unreasonable? - Unreasonable? - Yes. - Is that really being unreasonable? - Yes. Look, do you honestly think that girl means anything to me? - She means a hell of a lot to me David. They all have. - I love you. - That doesn't work anymore. - But I do. I will take Candy down and I'll get her a motel room okay? - Get one for yourself too while you're at it. For tonight. - In case you forgot this is my house. - I haven't forgotten, you've never let me forget. - I'm gonna go. - No. Cool it. Look, just stay here. Do me a favor, just sleep on it. - I've been sleeping on it, every night for the last two years. - Look, you can do whatever you want, because I don't care. - I know you don't. Hello. Dinah is that you darling? - Allison, how are you? - How am I? How are you? Is it not 6:15 in Lotus Land? Yeah I couldn't sleep. - Your voice is heavy. You sound just like that day you called me from that abortion place in the Bronx. What is it kiddo? David again? Yeah, partly. - Oh for Christ's sake, why don't you get that dog fixed? - It's over, it really is over. - I gotta admit kiddo, I'm not sorry to hear it. - Ali darling, listen, remember when I left you said there'd be a place for me if I wanted my old job back? - Yeah. Well I do. - Well, gee that's great. You're serious? You really wanna swap those palm trees for a walk up in Fear City? Is it a problem for you? - No, no.

Just take it easy. Now, what's your name? - Hunter, Dinah Hunter. - You got some ID? - Yes. No, it's in my purse, it was stolen. - Oh. - Two kids stole my purse. - Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Goddammit. - Hey, now you watch your mouth. Ain't no need to take the Lord's name in vain, you hear? - Yeah. Look, just, call my sister. - I ain't called nobodies sister nowhere. - You don't understand. - I understand. I understand you ain't got no ID. I understand a citizen of this county says you tried to assault him. - That's not true. - Well, which ain't true? - Jesus Christ! - Hey, I'm not about to tell you one more time, you shut that tramp yap of yours. Now you come with me. In the morning the Sheriff will straighten this out. Oh Gosh, I almost forgot why I stopped by. I promised Elders, I'd thank you personally for all the soda pop you donated for the picnic. That was mighty nice of you. - Anytime. Say hello to Reverend Coby for me. - I sure will. - Thanks again. - You don't understand, Yeah, well what time did they say she'd be back? The answering service doesn't know Sheriff, all they said was she's away for the weekend and they don't have a referral number. I see. Thank you much. - Excuse me Sheriff I've got the wire from the Laredo Police Department and I've got the rest of the file on Blake. Well bring 'em on over. - Any luck checking out the girl's story? - Nope, not yet. - Too bad you gotta hold her. - Yeah it is. But you gotta check 'em out first, Peters. They're too many criminals roaming around nowadays to let anybody walk before you're sure who they are. Now, bring in Blake and cuff him up good? - Right. - Oh. Says here you wanted for murder in Texas? Says a fella caught you trying to steal his melons and you hauled off and shot him. Now is that true? - If that's what it says. - Well that's what it says all right, did you? - What difference does it make? - Well it don't make squat to me boy, but going by this here record of yours, I'd say it's gonna make one hell of a big difference to you. Holy shit. You sure are some terrorist, aren't you? God almighty, you've got more time in than out. And by the way, that fella you were with, Vincent Lepardo, that got shot. FBI doesn't seem to be able to find any record of his kin. Did he have any? - I don't know. - You don't know. Well if we can't find his folks, I guess we're just gonna have to dump him in a hole somewhere. - That's your problem. - Want me to book him on the hijacking, Sheriff? - Oh yeah might as well. Go right ahead. But it don't make no difference anyway. Them folks from Orato already on their way up here with the extradition papers. - So? - So. He don't understand, does he? - I don't understand what? - This old boy ain't coming out, They're gonna stick his ass in a Texas can for life and a day. Are you ready for that? Are you ready for life and a day? - I'll play what's dealt. - Yeah well, we'll see, old boy. We'll see. Good evening. - Have you talked to anybody? Can I go yet? - No, not yet. I'm going off duty a little while. But don't you worry yourself. I'll keep trying to get through to 'em from my house. - Why do I have to stay here? Couldn't I go to a hotel? A motel? - You can go anyplace you want, just as soon as I'm satisfied who you are. Now if I here from them, tonight, in the middle of the night, I'll come down here myself and let you out. - Please. - There's nothing more I can do. There's nothing more I can do. I tried the guy in Los Angeles, nobody home. I put out an APB on the car and them kids. - Then you do believe me? - Well I figured it couldn't hurt none. I also talked to Dan Oldum about that there so called, assault charge of yours. And he allowed as maybe how he misunderstood the whole thing. He ain't gonna bring no charges. - He better not. - Oh you just take it easy. If you are who you say you are, you should be out of here in no time. Now here. Here's some candy, you take that. - No thanks. - Take it, come on. Comes from Paris, French. My cousin Floyd brought it to me. He's an airline pilot. He went to the University of Illinois, now good night. - Hey Sheriff. - What? - Where is he? Who? - Lepardo. He's in the icebox at Voltan's Funeral Home over in Tailorville, why? - Never mind. Oh God. - Hi Sheriff. - Oh hello, Hobie. How's the hunting? - It was good. It was real good. We got a spring. Boom, boom, boom. - Down, down. Now, now, now sit. - You know Curly? He got himself a nine pointer, big son of a bitch. - Good. You know we got a couple of guests for you in the back. Now the girl you don't have to worry about much, she's just being detained and will most probably released in the morning. But that guy is dangerous. So I want you to be real careful. - Oh sure I will. You know me. - Yeah Hobie, I know you. Good night, fellas. - Well Hobie, what you saying? How's your ass? - Good, real good. Hey, they, they eat yet? - No, Harv brought the food over, it's in the other room and I'm going on patrol, I'll see you later. - Right. Hello there. I brought you some dinner. My name's Hobie. I'm the night jailer. This sure smells good. Here you are. Well, if there's anything you need, you just let me know now. I brought you a comb and a mirror and a magazine too. - Thank you. Sure. What's the matter, didn't you like the food? - I wasn't hungry. Old Harv he makes the best beans and weenies in the whole world. I hear you're from Hollywood. Los Angeles. - That's Hollywood ain't it? - Sort of. - That's funny. I heard all you Hollywood girls like weenies. - You heard wrong. - Is that so? - Thank you. - Are you finished with that food here, boy? No I don't see no reason why not, Lyle. Almost four a.m. Everything's quiet here. Okay then I guess I'll try to catch a couple of hours. You call me at home if anything comes up, you hear? - Sure, sure I will, old buddy. 10-4. Be quiet. I ain't gonna hurt you none. We can do it the nice or we can do it real ugly. You understand? - Get off me. No, don't. No. No don't. No, God, no! Stop. - Shut up! Shut up. Shut up. - No. No, no, no. - You can quit hitting him. He's done. Come on let's go. Come on let's go! Get in the truck! Get in here. Bitch. - Hey come on. Let's go home and... - I'm getting a headache. - I'll drive. - No I'll drive. - Let me drive, let me drive. - You're drunk, I'll drive. - I'm okay. - I'll drive. - All right. - You know what you need, honey? - What's that? - You need this little thing. - Yeah I need that a bowl needs piss. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop. - Get over there, get over there! - Why the hell did you take me out of there? I should have stayed there and could've explained it all to them. Why the hell did you take me out of there? - They'd have walked in there and they'd seen you with that stool in your hands, standing over a dead cop. They would have shot your ass on sight. You killed a cop back there and they don't take kindly to that. It don't matter what he did to you. - Oh God. I killed that man. - Yeah, you did. - It was self defense. - Was it? - Yeah. I've gotta go back. I've gotta go back there. - I ain't going back there. - You've gotta go back. They'll listen to us. - That's enough of that us shit, lady. I'm not going back and that's final. - Goddammit you've gotta go back. Listen right. We're gonna go and we're gonna say. I wanna phone my sister. Take me to a phone. - I ain't got time to be looking for no damn phone. - Please. - Move over and shut up. - Give me a phone. - These are for you. - You got salt? One moment. That dumb bastard. He ain't never gonna get that bird. Not in a million years. No. - It's Coley, it's Coley. So what if it's Coley? - Nothing. - Don't get out unless I tell you too. - What's up, Coley? - Hello, Pearl. - Where's Lepardo? - Dead. - Thinking we was done with you, Blake. - You ain't never gonna be done with me, Shaw. - Hi, Coley. - Cassie Ann. Get inside, hear? - Just... - I said get your ass inside. - You still got that envelope I gave you? Yeah. - Could you get it? You got anything she could wear? - I suppose so. Come on honey, see if we can find something to cover up all that pretty skin of yours. Let's see. Yeah, it's not very much good for the road? Okay. What do we have? Well well, these are gonna have to do. Here. You put that on. - You reckon that's him? - That's him, all right. - I don't know Jessie, maybe we ought to call for some help. - Hell, they don't have time for that. We can handle him. - You sure? - Yeah. Look, go get the megaphone. You Coley's girl now? - No. - Then how come you're with him? - It's a long story. - I should've known you weren't. You ain't his type at all. - You're his type? - I was, once. Before he went to Florence. - That his girl now? - Who? - Florence. - Florence ain't no girl. It's a prison in Arizona. - Oh. - Hey, do me a favor? - What's that? Give Coley a kiss and tell him it's from me. - Why don't you give him one yourself? He's right out there. - I wish I could. But I can't. Not in front of Shaw. Will ya? - Yeah. - What I said before, about you not being his type. I was just being mean. You could be anybody's type. - Thanks. - Come on man, get down here. Hell, you tell 'em we're here. - Come get Vinnie out of Tailorville bury him some place decent. - Will do. All right you people out there. This is the Baker town police. Throw down your weapons, put your hands over your head. - Split Coley, we can handle it. Go on. - I really think we ought to get some help, Jessie. - I think you're right. - Check this place out. Don't look like there's anybody here. - What are we doing here? I've gotta get to a phone. I've gotta call my sister. - Take it easy. I'll get you to a phone. There's too much heat on the road right now. We've gotta stay right here for a while. I'm gonna take a look around. You see what you can find to eat. Howard Meekin, the owner of Saint Clemente California Dance Studio was not available for comment. However an instructor at the school did confirm that Anara Dixon has recently completed the basic rhythm chords and was now enrolled in advanced jazz class. And now turning to sport. The Dallas Cowboys gave up a two touchdown lead in the fourth... Is there anything on the radio about us? - Yeah. We're cop killers. They must've found my prints on that stool. You look frazzled. I sure hope you know what you're letting yourself in for. Jail ain't no day at the beach. - Maybe I won't have to go to jail. - If you go back you will. - If I don't, what kind of chance have I got? - A good one. You drop out, go under, there's no way they'll ever find you. Are you crazy? I'd be hunted the rest of my life. - By who? Where you been living? On Mars? There's half a million killers walking loose around this country, the police don't have any time to look for 'em. You drop out and go under and you'll be all right. - Is that what you're gonna do? Go under? I've been under all my life. - And you got caught. - Of course I got caught. You steal and you're gonna get caught sooner or later. Something you've gotta expect. But you, if you're as clean as you say you are, well you could make it. - I couldn't handle being a fugitive. - You are a fugitive. - I had no choice. Who the hell gets choices? - I suppose you had to be a criminal? - No, hell no. I could've been an astronaut. - You could've been any damn thing you wanted to be. - Hey, you understand something. I'm a thief because I wanna be a thief. I don't wanna nothing else. Now there's nothing wrong with being a crook. Everybody's crooked. I never met a straight person in my whole life. This whole goddamn country is a rip off and everybody in it. - I think there's some honest people left. - Yeah, one's that haven't been caught yet. - I still think there's honest people in this world. - Yeah well you go right on believing, but don't be surprised if some jury don't have your ass for Easter. You know, I swear I don't know what kind of cave you've been hiding in, but you better wise up fast. You killed a cop. I know you didn't mean to, but they're still gonna try you for it and even if you beat it, you're gonna be a lot different person when it's through with. And if they convict you, well you've got no idea and I mean no idea at all, what it's like on the inside. Unless you learn the jail real quick. And all them other people in the joint, they're, they're gonna eat you alive. That night jailer was just openers. You ain't on death row yet. I didn't mean to shake you up out there. I just wanted you to know the score and everything, you know. - I know. You all right? - Yes. Are you sure? - Yes. - Boy I, I'm hungry. - So am I? - I mean I tell ya, I could eat a bear. How about you? Could you eat a bear? Claws and tail. Claws and tail. Yeah me too. - To extraordinary luck. - I could sure as hell use some of that. - I'm cold. It's cold? Pull that blanket up. - Oh yeah. Where you going? - I don't know. Canada maybe. - Why don't you, why don't you lie down? There's plenty of room. - I want you to turn yourself in. You tell 'em that I killed him and that I made you go with me because you saw me do it. - I can't do that. - Of course you can. It don't make any difference to me. - I can't do that. I've gotta go back and explain to them, they'll understand. I've still got faith. - I hope you've got a cartload of it. Yeah that don't do no good. - I know. Can't help it. - Hey, you'll be all right. Easy, boss. Easy. Get up. - Getting up, getting up. - Slow. Slow. - You too. - Coley! - No! Please no. Please. I'll drive! - Yeah, but are you sure it's the man? Yeah it's them all right. They beat old Sam Hayes up bad. We're taking him into Fallsburg. They should hit the highway any minute. Can you intercept? - 10-4, we're on our way. Come on. - That turned out bad. For the fundamental principles of freedom and truth, that this great nation was founded upon. - What's your name? I can't hear you. I still can't hear you. I still can't hear you, Pachowsky. - To you, my fellow citizens of Fallsburg. And to our forefathers who sacrifices and vision have made this dream of liberty and justice come true for all of us, I thank you. March. That's right man, clear off the road, lucky we're both alive. - Which way are they coming? Straight down 91, out back. - Okay, I'll get some kind of a road block up. Are you guys okay? I mean can you make it in? Yeah we're okay I guess, but if you got a free car send 'em out. - Don't have no free car, you got your own problems. - Go on, ease it up in here. Come on. - They're not behind us. - No, they're ahead of us. - Pigs. - That's right you heard me. Get Amis and Wilbur over here off that traffic circle. - We nearly made it. - They ain't playing nearly. Come on, they'll help you. - I can't. - I've got to go. - They're gonna kill you. - I don't mind. I was born dead. - Run! - Boys get back in your car and go up Bay Street and catch him up on Main. You two go up 13th and catch him over at Southbank all right? There, there he is, get him! - All right get out of there. You heard me, get out! - I can't. My shoulder. - Come on. - You son of a bitch.
