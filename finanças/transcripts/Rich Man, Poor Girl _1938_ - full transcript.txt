Any special instructions, Joan? First thing to remember is .. To be here a half hour before Mr Harrison in the morning. Does he call me first and let me know when he leaves the house? Mr Harrison gets here at 9:30. Personally, it's a little early for me. Change his service twice a day. Mr Harrison is very particular about his drinking water. How does he take it? Hot, lukewarm or cold? Pleasantly cool. Do I feed it to him with an eyedropper? See that he has plenty of sharp pencils. He likes small ones this size. So break them in half. Are the big ones too heavy? Then you open his mail. Just the business letters of course. You know, honey. I think you're spoiling that boy. As it's his office and his business I think we can let him have his own way. Don't you? - Okay, Joan. Don't you worry about Mr Harrison. When you get back from vacation you'll find everything just as you left them. Good morning, Mr Harrison. - Good morning, Joan. Please don't let me disturb you. I was just showing Miss Willis where everything is. She is taking my place. Your what? I am leaving today on my vacation. That is a bit of bad news. Miss Thayer. I'm sorry. I'll miss you You know of course, if you go, we may as well close up the place. It really isn't that bad, Mr Harrison. I'd like to hear your notion of a vacation. Well, it is a little boarding house called Paradise in the Pines. Twelve rooms. Three baths. Two row boats and a hammock. - Oh, please. You deserve better than that. You are too nice a girl, Joan. - Thank you. Now, wait a minute. Come on, sit down. My boat, the Hilda, is shipshape and ready to go. I'll stock her with a couple of respectable chaperones of both sexes. We'll sail around The Cape straight up to Bar Harbor. My sister is there with her crowd. Am I getting a reaction? Definitely. I will stick to Paradise in the Pines. Now, Joan. What is worrying you? Well, I suppose it's because I'm really because I am a nice girl, Mr Harrison. Well, did I say no? Have you a sister? - Yes. She might come along. I have a mother and a father too, of course. And a brother and a cousin. Cousin Henry. - That's a little crowded. And they are all coming to the station to see me off. Listen to it, Mrs Thayer. It's enough to drive you crazy. I know whose radio it is. He's a big drunk and a good-for-nothing. And I'm getting all the tenants of both buildings to complain to the police. I think a man has the right to play the radio in his own home if he wants to. Even if it is a little annoying. Well, he's making a nervous wreck out of Fluffy. I have a husband and four young people living here. They all work for a living and they've all got to get their rest. If they can get used to it I think Fluffy can. Three gross, number 585. Windows screws. Number 585. Window screws. Pop, we'll never get through. We haven't made a dent in this room yet. Now take it easy, son. We'll get down to the station in plenty of time to say goodbye to Joan. About forty gross half-inch, number 9 fancy sink plugs. Furnace blanks, sink plugs, rubber plungers. I can't stand the excitement. Is that you talking, son? It sounded for a minute like it might be your cousin, Henry. Henry is alright. He may not hold a job long but there is plenty doing while he has it. I don't want to see any more styles. All I want are my own shoes that I wore in here. Where are the shoes I wore in here? Madam. Are you sure you had shoes on when you came in? How dare you. Hey, mister. Yes, madam? Can I help you? - No. I want my shoes so that I can get out of here. Henry, where are the lady's shoes? - Mr Krauss, I can't find them. What are you talking about? - I can tell you where they are. I think he packed them in one of these boxes. And put them back on the shelf. - How can you do such a thing, Thayer? How? I'll tell you how. I'm trying to wait on five women at once. None know what they want but want me to find it for them. I have only got two hands and one pair of feet. I can't do it, Krauss. Nobody could do it. That's enough, Thayer. We'll find your shoes for you. You wait in my office. I won't wait in your office, Krauss. I will tell you right here. Punch your time card. Get out of here. - Krauss. First, I'm, going to punch your nose and then I'll punch my time and then .. Ah. Take her to the rest room. You poor kid. Thanks, Kate. It was the only way I could figure out how to get out of this. What? My sister Joanie is leaving on vacation today. And I just get down to the station to say goodbye to her. "Ticonderoga and points north." All aboard. Wait a minute. - Hold it, will you. I'll handle this. Why close the gate now when it takes five minutes before the train departs? Look mister, let go of my arm. I know. I am very impressed with your authority. We're all impressed. But railroads are a public utility. And as part of that public I demand that you show us a little consideration. Okay, mister. Well, that's telling him, Henry. That's your public servant. - She'll never make it. Something must have happened to Joan. They've probably got her pounding the typewriter until the very last minute. She should have walked out the way I did. Henry. You didn't quit your job again? I had to, uncle Phil. Things were said to me that I could not overlook. And what did they say? You are fired? Henry. And the way conditions are. - I can't help it. My principles are more important to me than any job. Hello. I am awfully sorry. Joan. Where were you? I'm not taking my vacation yet. What? - You are not? That is a shame. - They can't do that. Well, I am so rushed .. I mean we're all so rushed at the office that I thought it better if I waited. Do mean to say you're taking this without putting up a fight? But Henry, I don't want to fight. Really I don't. Sure. That's how people like us get pushed around by people like them. It does suit their convenience so .. Boom. No vacation. Joan, it doesn't seem fair. If Joanie is satisfied that's all there is to it. It is alright with me, darling. What good does it do for us to stick up for our rights? A girl like Joan comes along and puts us back fifty years. Hey. What have you got in your back pockets? Shoes. Holy mackerel. That is where they were. We still haven't received an office plan for this floor. Tell the supervising architect. Alright? Yes. Joan. Bill. - I love you. Don't say that, Bill. Darling, will you please do me the very great honor .. Of becoming my wife? You said 'wife' exactly as though you meant it. Why shouldn't I mean it? You mean, your wife? You are not being very bright, dearest. And I thought you were just a .. A no-good .. swell .. guy. I love you. Bill. Darling. Will you please take me off this building now. Why are you crying, darling? - I don't know. I .. I did fall and bang my head. I am unconscious. I am dreaming. This should have happened six months ago. Six months shot to bits. We drive to Connecticut, get married .. And by this time tomorrow we'll be on the boat on our way. Married tonight you mean? - Yes. Bill. That is for the movies. - No. This isn't. But .. there is the family. Family? Just my sister Sally and two broken down aunts .. No. Not yours. Mine. I wasn't found in a flowerpot, darling. Your family, angel face? We'll go right up and tell them. No, please. Let me tell them myself. I'll do it better on my own. I give you a 5-minute head start so you'd better tell them fast. Well. I gave it to him straight from the shoulder. 'That's how fellows like you get to be sales managers' I said. 'By crucifying the rest of us'. You mean you left your new position, Henry? Fired again, huh? I wouldn't work for a firm that tried to put over that hypocritical bunk. They can pay me for my time but they cannot pollute my reason. And you have been there three weeks. I must be slipping. And I ain't getting wise to them as quick as they used to. Is that you, Joan? Yes, Ma. Hello everybody. Hello Pa. Hello darling. - Hello Ma. I thought you were having dinner downtown. I'll fix you something now. - No. I am not a bit hungry. Joan, is anything wrong? - No, dear. No. Not much. You haven't lost your position? - No, Pa. What's up? Come on, Joan. What's has happened? Here it is. I am going to be married. Married? You're what? Joan, that is marvellous. Who is the lucky guy? Joanie, quick. I can't bear it. Well. It's Bill. Bill? - Bill who? Mr Harrison. Mr Harrison? - Your boss? You mean that multi-billionaire you work for? Oh yippee! My sister has hit the jackpot. I am mighty glad. If you love him. And he loves you. Oh, mum. Wait until you meet him. He is a fine boy. I'm sure of that. Well, Joan. I hope it works out. - Oh, what's wrong with you two chumps? This is the greatest thing that ever happened to this family. What are you getting all puffed up about? Because Harrison is rich? The finest man alive today probably hasn't got an extra shirt to his back. Money is a crime. Unless there is character at the back of it. Listen. Anybody with that much money has plenty of character with me. I'd like to meet the young man, Joan. - You will. He'll be here any minute. Any minute? - Coming to this dump? Helen. Henry. Frank. Help clear away this table. Helen, that parlor should be dusted. Oh, Ma. Nothing but a fire would help that parlor. Don't make a fuss please. He isn't at all a guest. Just the same, he isn't coming to a messy house. You get fixed up. Boys, put on your coats and ties. Goodnight, I'm sunk. What will I wear? Joan, how about your blue Burberry? Thanks. I guess I had better change to a fresh shirt myself. I still can't believe it. It's goofy. It's marvellous. Is he handsome, Joan? Not that it makes any difference. I think he is. - Big or little? About six feet I guess. Hmm. Tall, rich and handsome. A triple threat man. That reminds me of Tom Grogan. The contrast is terrific. A clean shirt. This will throw me off schedule for a week. Well, let him come. What kind of a guy do you think he is? One of those regular fellows. Very democratic. Have you seen my front collar button? Yes. It's in the propeller there. Again. Would you please stop building aeroplanes with my collar buttons. Come in. Well, do we pass? - Bring him on. He may be richer but he can't be cleaner than us. The worst we can get is a tie. Joan, you have got a run. Oh well. You can't meet a man like that with a run in your stocking. She has done alright so far. [ Buzzer ] There is the bell. - The bell for the first round. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. Good evening, Mr Harrison. - Hello. I am Helen. Joan's little sister. How do you do, Helen. - Hi. It is rather hot to drag yourself up .. Three flights isn't it. - Not at all. Well, I will tell Joan you're here. - Thank you. She is .. she is expecting you. Joanie. Joanie, he is wonderful. He is absolutely adorable. I don't care if he didn't have a cent. - That's what I think. Bill. Did you tell them, darling? - Yes. They are in there waiting for me to call them. They are coming. They're coming. See, Pop. The college education paid off alright. This is Bill, everybody. This is my mother, Bill. How do you do, mother. Very happy to meet you. Thank you. You caught us at kinda short notice. I am in a great hurry to marry Joan. My dad. - How do you do, sir. Hello .. glad to meet you, Mr Harrison. Well, let's keep it 'Bill'. - You've met my sister. Oh, yes. Of course. - We've met. My brother Frank. Hello. And my cousin Henry. Hello Henry. - Hello. Well, won't you sit down please? Thank you. Thank you. I hope you will just let me drop in to the family circle and .. I'll try to be as little trouble as possible. No trouble. - Helen. Well .. Mr Harrison. 'Bill', please. I admit it is all very sudden. But at the same time Joan knows her own mind. Still, in all I think there is one or two things .. We ought to know before .. Well, that is .. Before you get married. Certainly. Fire away. Well, I .. I don't suppose there is any question about your being able to .. Support our daughter. I think you'd better ask Joan that. She knows more about my business than I do. Don't worry, father. They'll be able to make both ends meet. Hey. Turn down that radio and shut up. Ah, shut up yourself, you big baboon. What did you call me? A baboon. You big ape. Just a couple of social climbers. I don't know what's happened to this neighborhood. It was so quiet and refined when we first moved in. How do you know? You were born here. So you think that's loud, eh? How do you like this? I think we will be more comfortable in the parlor. Come on, Pop. Really, I .. That is alright. Go ahead mister .. Bill. - No, please. I was about to say I'd like to offer you a drink but .. I doubt we have anything in the house. Oh, dad. Are we out again? Again? When do we ever keep any liquor? How about a cigar? Well .. I've got a fine cigar I've been saving for somebody. I never touch them myself. Frank, look in my bureau drawer behind the socks. See if you can find that glass tube with a cigar in it. I don't think Bill really wants a cigar, father. Oh, he will want this one. I got it at a hardware convention last season. Mr Hankey gave it to me himself. That's it. There you are, Bill. Thank you very much. It seems to be a little dry. No, no. It is fine. There. I guess it is a little too dry. Don't bother smoking it, Bill. No, no. I am enjoying it. Joan, darling. You haven't told us about your honeymoon. Where do you plan to go? Bill has a boat. - Well it .. Well, it isn't much of a boat. Gee. I know where I would go. Tell us, Helen. Oh .. Paris and .. And Hawaii. Yeah. They are right next door to each other. What do you say, Joan? Yes, Bill. Any place. - Then that is it. Gee. Gee, I just go limp thinking about it. Paris and Hawaii. Sounds pretty good. Just like that, huh? Mr Harrison. I wonder if you would mind answering a personal question. Shoot, Henry. How does it feel to be rich? I expected that from you. What business is it of yours, Henry? I didn't mean to offend Mr Harrison. We're all one big family. I never thought about it very much. What do you mean? - Please. Don't encourage him. How does it feel to know you can hop on an ocean liner whenever you want to? That you never need worry about a bill. That you can buy and sell practically everybody you meet on the street. It feels alright. What I am driving at is .. Whether you don't feel a whole lot superior to people like us. Well, of all the nerve. Sorry. I don't. I want to warn you that this is chronic with Henry. There's a million things a fellow like you ought to know. And I suppose never would know unless you came across a guy like me. I haven't exactly led a sheltered life myself, Henry. I personally deal with all the men who work for me. What kind of men? Bricklayers, plasterers, pick and shovels and .. That is exactly what I am not talking about. No? Well then, what are you talking about? The rest of the people that make up this country. The great big middle class that furnishes the armies and navies. And that nobody outside themselves ever talks about or even thinks about. Except you. Now, take us right here for instance. We are just plain people. We work for a living. Work like horses. We get a few dollars ahead and .. Something always happens to take it away. So, we start all over again. But do we kick about it? No. We stick it through. And what do we get for it? That is my question, Mr Harrison. What do we get for it? I think we'd all like to have some iced tea. Do you want to help me, Henry? Don't pay attention to him, Bill. He is like that all the time. [ Doorbell ] That sounds like Tom. Oh, Frank. I don't want to see him. Tell him I am busy. Take it easy, boy. I'm coming, Relax. When Tom is in here he just acts rough like that because .. He is really very shy. Did you meet Mr Grogan, the strong man of the block? We let him pin us to the mat now and then for the honor of the neighborhood. I'm glad to meet you, Grogan. - Likewise. I didn't get the name. Bill Harrison. Welcome. What line are you in? Tommy. Mr Harrison is at the head of his own business. So what? So am I. What's your racket? Real estate and buildings. Me too. I've got three trucks working all the time. Ha. What is so funny? I don't think it is exactly the time to talk business, Tommy. We didn't have a chance to tell you yet but Joan and Mr Harrison are engaged. Well. What do you know. Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Now we can make it a double wedding. What do you say, Helen? Tom doesn't mean it. He is just joking. What do you mean, joking? Any time I walk up three flights of stairs three nights a week .. My intentions are serious. Tommy. If we're going to go to the movies we'd better get started. What movies? Ah, she is a jitterbug. If it ain't dancing, it's the movies, then dancing. Refreshments. Let me help you, Ma. Rebecca at the well. Nice work, Rebecca. Well, that is all of us, Bill. Including Mr Grogan. What did Helen call him? Shy? Gee, my heart broke for that poor kid. She tried so hard. Explaining us all over the place. Joan, I have got to get you out of this. It's pretty awful, isn't it. Oh no. I didn't mean that. Well. I .. hate to see people poor. And I am not going to let your family stay here either. Including Henry. I am crazy about them all. So crazy you just told me you had to get me out of this. Bill, I am stupid but .. I don't think we can rush ahead the way you would like. Why not? Because we don't want an overnight honeymoon and a 24-hour divorce. You don't know anything about us and you had better find out. Why? I've found out I love you. And that is all I care about. Oh darling, I should grab you and run. Now you are talking. But I love my family very much. And they love me. I couldn't let myself become a stranger to them. Didn't they know you'd get married and .. Leave them one day? Of course. But not to anybody like you, darling. To them, you are some vague figure from another world. And that is what I would be. Coming back here to visit. A stranger. With a handful of your money. I want to ease them into the idea of you. But I think that's the right thing to do for your sake too. Working together in an office does not mean that you know me, Bill. Well, maybe not. But if we'd done what I had wanted to do we'd have been married by now. Instead of standing on a roof talking a lot of .. Who did that? Who did that? You have hurt Fluffy. Good morning, Ma. - Good morning, Bill. Did you know Joan sent me this? Yes, Bill. Don't you think she's being very foolish? Yes I do. You sure don't get to marry a rich young man every day. Or as nice as you either. Thank you, Ma. My girls are old enough to know what to think for themselves. If Joan wants a little more time to get used to the idea I guess it's alright. Why? You see, I need a mother's advice. I suppose she figures if you want her you'll keep her alright. I guess you weren't drunk when you asked you to get married. What is it that Joan wants? Do you know, Ma? It is my fault, son. I am a Bisby. I guess Joan is a Bisby too. Now, that don't mean a thing to you. But you go up the coast. Up around Punxsutawney. And I guess they're still saying .. As contrary as a Bisby. Are you from down east, Ma? Yes, Bill. My Pa and his folks were whalers and traders from way back. Captains, some to them. My grandma, and my ma too. Knew the China coast better than they did their own home. Too stubborn to sit home and wait for their men. Was Mr Thayer, Pa .. was he a .. No, Bill. I was seventeen when Pa came through Punxsutawney. Drummond Hardware. We rented him the spare room in our house. I made up my mind to marry him and I did. We came back here and we've been here ever since. Do you ever miss it up there, Ma? Hand me another clothes pin, Bill. You are the only member of this family who really knows what she wants. Yes. Well, you don't know what people want. Until you've lived with them a long time. You would think Pa would be sick of hardware by now. He still wants to own his own store. My Frank wants to build airplanes. My Helen wants to be a society girl and wear pretty clothes. Henry has been living with us since he was fourteen. And in all that time he's itched to go to places in the world .. And do things with adventure in them. And what does Joan want? Joan is a contrary Bisby like I told you. I didn't question her. Ma. When I realised I was much in love with Joan I wanted to get married right away. I heard her .. Arguments against it and I can't agree with her. Well, you will both be all the better for having his out before. People from different places in life, different religions or ideas. Should have it all out first. And know what it is that makes the other one tick. Before they settle down together. And how long does that take? If you want each other bad enough .. It don't take long. Listen, Ma. I'm going to do something about this and do it right away. And you're going to help me. Remember what you told me about Pa and that spare room up at Punxsutawney? Henry. Henry. There is going to be a lot of jobs open in six months, aunt Alice. 'Got to come back in six months'. That's all I've heard all day. Never mind. Get yourself showered while you can. The others will be here any minute. Hello, Henry. It's a funny thing. A man eats at a table all his life but when he sets it for the first time .. He can't remember where the forks go. - Well. Are you going to break bread with us tonight? If it's alright with you. - Me? Bill, I am glad they let me eat here. What is the matter? A tough day? Yeah. I'd like to ask you a purely rhetorical question. You mean I don't have to answer this one? Since you can't. Did you by any chance ever pound the pavements looking for a job? Ever fill out forty application blanks and intelligence tests in one day .. Trying to snag a 20-buck position? Did you ever take a thorough physical examination .. To prove your fitness to sell electric mothballs on a strict commission basis? No. - Of course not. So let's drop the whole subject. But that doesn't mean I don't recognise ability when I see it. What kind of a job were you looking for? One that I get myself. Thanks. Ma. - Yes, Helen? I got to grab myself a shower before supper. Mother, we are home. I'll take a shower Ma, and be right out. Say, wait a minute. - I was first. Let me get in there .. - Easy, easy. Bill. - Bill? Hello, darling. The mountain wouldn't come to work so Mohammed got himself asked to dinner. Alright? Yes, Bill. Why, Bill. - Good evening, dad. Hello Frank. - Hello Bill. I guess we had better ask them now. Ask us what? Or should we wait for Helen? - You've got a long wait. Helen. Helen. Come out here quick. If anyone objects to what I'm going to ask please be perfectly honest. I am not crazy and I know what I am doing. Some things were said last night that I don't believe. I am going to find out if they are true. What do you want? Oh. Excuse me. Wait a minute, Helen. I .. I have asked Ma to let me stay here for a few days. Huh? - What? Stay here? - In this dump? And he claims he isn't crazy. I don't think it's a dump. You get along alright. I don't see why, because you don't live on Park Avenue .. I have to postpone marrying Joan. I want to find out what makes all the so-called difference. That has nothing to do with it. Nothing at all, Bill. But Bill, there's no place for you to sleep. Yes, there is. I discovered the couch in the living room is a Davenport. That's even uncomfortable to sit on. You won't be able to stand the heat in there, Bill. You stand it alright. How love is the strangest thing. Henry. Ma and I agreed. One blackball and I am out. Then I vote 'yes'. That count might change your whole outlook on life. Thanks. Joan? Would you mind stepping into the next room? Certainly not, dear. Now Bill, you get your hat and leave quietly. Afraid to have me stay here? Let's not be childish. This isn't funny. Now, darling. You asked for a chance to work this out in your own way. Now, be on the level and give me the same chance. Bill, you're trying to laugh me out of it. Of course I am. I think you're silly. Understanding your family comes down to sleeping on a Davenport. Do you really think so? Now, If you want to get your things and come and get married, okay darling. Bill, you have the money to get your way in most things. But it's not going to be quite so easy this time. I don't want to be rescued from the slums. When I marry you it will be for my whole life. Come what may. I have tried to explain that we have a problem with my family .. Because I won't let myself be cut off from them. I want to work it out myself. Is that too much to ask, Bill? I want to be with you. Either you come with me or I stay here. You wouldn't last 24 hours. We'll see about that. - No. Well, we get one break anyway. The mosquitoes round here must be pretty tired of biting the usual poor people. Good night, Frank. - Goodnight. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Ice water. Florence Nightingale. What's that for? I think you should have a chance to defend yourself. Joan. Come back to the office, Joan. I need you. I suppose I may as well. - Don't make any snap judgements. Sleep on it. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight. [ Loud music ] Bill? Bill. Hey, everybody. Our guest took a powder. - Oh, really? I knew he wouldn't last. - Listen to this. 'Dear family. It's 6am Sunday morning'. 'The radio across the street predicts a heatwave today'. 'Let's all duck out on it with a nice, cool sail'. 'Please meet me at my boat the Hilda'. 'At 79th Street and Hudson river as soon as possible'. 'Love, Bill'. Let me see it. A yacht too, huh. Oh boy, this is what I've been dreaming of. Us .. stretched out on the deck. Drinking champagne through a straw. While the cool breeze tickles me to death. Yippee! - Pretty classy, huh? Joanie, can I wear your pale green sports shoes? What's he trying to do? Break us down so we won't be able stand this place? Yeah. That guy isn't so stupid. He has another guess coming as far as I'm concerned. Think we should go, Joan? Why not, Pa? If Bill wants to show us the finer things of life. And you and Frank can stay home if you feel that way about it. Stay home? No chance. I am going to get a load of this rolling in dough on the rolling deep. I never heard such ingratitude. Get dressed all of you. So we can weigh anchor and set off. Before the tied starts running. Sailing, sailing, over the bounty bay. La de da dum di .. It must be this one. It is the biggest. But it's an ocean liner. It must cost a pile of money, eh mother? I suggest from stem to stern she is 120 feet. She must carry a crew of eight or ten. Gee, just think last night he was sleeping in our parlor. Do we have to swim out? She hangs davits with two dories. Talk English, will you Ma. That can't be the Hilda. The boatyards aren't that large. Well, he's got a captain, hasn't he? And a first mate and a cook. And a stooge to get seasick for him. Hello folks. Come on aboard. We got a great day for sailing. So this is the Hilda? Yes. What do you think of her? Kinda small, isn't it? Small? She's the fastest job in these waters. We thought it was that one over there. That tub? That is playboy stuff. That's not a boat. It's a hotel. Hello honey. - Hello. You wouldn't like it. No .. I guess not. Bill .. she's trim and sweet. I'd like to see her go. You will, Ma. Is this what they call 'sailing'? Well, until we get out aways. Look at all those houses. Yes. Must be mighty cool out there facing the water. If you must live in a city that's the place to do it, isn't it. Must get good money up around here, huh? No, not so much. You know, I own a bit of that property and most of those apartments are empty. I'll tell you what I will do, Pa. I'll make you a proposition. You furnish the family and I will furnish the flat. Do you mean it, Bill? Why not? They are not doing anyone any good up there empty. Ha. Ha, what? Nothing. A place up there costs three thousand a year if it cost a cent. Why couldn't you just drop into the water while nobody was looking? I think there is something to what Henry says, Bill. I've never had to thank anybody for anything. And I don't want to start now. Of course, if I could pay my share I'd be willing. But I can't. You wouldn't mind a little more room to breathe in would you, Ma? It's mighty kind of you, Bill. But Pa is head of the family. There is no use getting sore, Bill. But it just shows how little you understand people like us. I understand you. I wish some shark would climb up here and get you. Helen. We happen to have some pride and independence. Playing the benefactor to a lot of poor victims is great sport. But it doesn't change the system. Ah, go and walk the plank. Henry, is it your mission in life to see that nobody enjoys himself? It is too beautiful a day to quarrel. I think I know how we all feel. No-one wants to use it. But the word is 'charity'. The family won't take charity, Bill. She is starting to spank, Bill. Right, Ma. Hold the tiller can you Henry while I go forward and hoist the sail. This is a bit out of my line. Oh. It won't bite you. Keep her fast on this course. Need a hand, Bill? Fine, Ma. You can help tie her off. If I remember how. Why .. I say. There is nothing to this. It is like handling a baby carriage. That is the stuff, matey. Hey. What are you trying to do? I thought you said it was like pushing a baby carriage. Have a heart, Bill. Sailing, sailing over the bounding main. There is many a stormy breeze to blow. What is wrong, Philip? I think I will lie down. I feel drowsy. Did you say .. drowsy? Open your collar and stretch out a bit. Bless you. Some salad, Henry? No thanks. You can have my share of it. You can have my share of the whole expedition. Nonsense. You can live very nicely on a boat like this. Sure. Tarzan lives in a tree. What did you think this morning when you found I was gone? I'm not doing any thinking at all, Bill. Or any talking either. You've taken it up with the family and I will leave it with them. You look so lovely. Did you sleep at all? I'll die for you darling but I won't lie to you about that Davenport. Ghastly? I'll lick it. You're spoiling us, Ma. Don't you catch cold, Joan. No. She won't. Hello, Miss Thayer. Morning, Miss Harrison. How are you? - Fine, thank you. You're still the smartest looking girl in town. Is my brother here? - Go right in. Thank you. Bill. Bill. Hello, baby. - Tired? No. I was just .. lying here thinking. Lucky I came in or you'd have fallen asleep in a minute. Well, I've been .. Having a little insomnia lately. Where were you having it? I tried to get you everywhere last night. Sally, I have got great news. I think I am engaged to Joan. Miss Thayer? - The same. Oh, Bill. That's the first really sensible thing you have done all summer. Congratulations, darling. Or aren't you sure yet? Well, it is a little complicated unless you know the Thayers. They are a very proud race and cousin Henry is their prophet. Who is cousin Henry? Cousin Henry is the man who invented the great middle class. He's very keen on it. Its independence. Its pride and habit of getting stuck no matter what happens. He is very proud of that. - You know them well? Know them? I've fallen in love with all of them. Including Henry. And I'm going to help them out. Whether they like it or not. 'Equatorial Export Company Limited. 26 Wall Street. Mr Henry Thayer'. 'Dear sir, would you be good enough to see me at my office at 11am July 7th ..' 'On a matter of the utmost importance to yourself'. 'Very truly yours, L. L. Potter. General Manager'. What's the gag? Did I ever apply for a job at that place? What about your new job at the Firmin Haberdashery? I was just getting sick of that job at Firmin's anyway. Frankie. I got a feeling that this is the turning point in my life. Wow! 'Henry Matthews Thayer. Equatorial Export Company Limited'. Burra-bruco, Brazil. Stick tight, baby. We're going to see the world. I found it, Henry. Here it is right here. Just two inches off the coast. Every one of those inches is about a thousand miles down in Brazil. You just follow the coast right down to Rio. Rolling down to Rio. You lucky stiff. - Lucky? My dear amigo, Francisco. The outside world recognises my talents even if you do not. What I can't understand is how you got the job without any investigation. You know. That's all taken care of even before they approach a man. This Mr Potter who wrote me this morning knew more about me than I do myself. If possible. That Spanish you took in night school is going to come in handy. Yeah. Except that they speak Portuguese in Brazil. Henry. See me, junior. How would you like to take my picture with you? Wow. I'll wear it on my bureau. Right next to my hairbrushes. And if you find any stray Brazilian cattle kings, you know you .. Might pass it around. What's the matter with Tom Grogan? Outside of everything, nothing. I wish you wouldn't go dancing with him if you felt that way about him, Helen. It took me three months to teach him to truck on down. And I am going to collect. [ Loud music ] Shush. Do you hear that? My native song. The se?oritas will swoon when they see my tongue. Amigos. All set, Henry? - Yeah. Boy, what a satisfaction when I went up to old man Firmin and gave him this. I told him I was quitting tonight and told him why. I envy you. You know, I'd like to stick around and civilise you, Bill. But .. business prevents. Listen, everybody. We must celebrate. What do you say we throw a farewell party for Henry someplace? Bill, that's a swell idea. What about your date with Tom the 'trucking truckman'? Oh, him? - Bring him along. No. One drink and he would be trying toeholds on all the waiters. This is a family affair. I'll reserve a table. That is mighty nice of you, Bill. - It sure is, kid. If you ever happen to pass through Brazil I want you to remember that .. My hacienda is your hacienda. Here's to you, Henry. Bon voyage and all the success you deserve. You ought not to wish him that kind of hard luck. Thank you. My friends. I can only say that .. Isn't that gorgeous. Boy, you sure do things right, Bill. You are an angel. Speech, speech. Bill. I am speechless. For the first time in his life. Don't bother saying it, Henry. We will drink a silent toast. No thank you, Bill. I don't think I could take any more. Come on, Ma. Let's celebrate. Sure, Bill. Let her rip. I'll have fifteen days on the boat to sober up. Say, what do you know? There is Mr Potter's assistant. Wait a minute. Who is Mr Potter? He is the manager of the Equatorial Exports. He gave Henry this job. Excuse me. I have to phone. Bill. Folks, this is Mr Allen. Mr Potter's assistant. The man who made me possible. How do you do. Good evening. And this is Bill Harrison. Oh yes. I know Mr Harrison. Good evening, sir. You know him? - Oh, certainly. Mr Harrison and Mr Potter are .. - Glad to see you again, Allen. Please. Please don't let me disturb your party. Well. Good luck again, Thayer. What was his name, Bill? Allen. So you and Potter know each other, huh? Casually. Come on, cut the cake, Henry. Just casually, huh? I know lots of people. You didn't have anything to do with him offering me this job, did you? That is silly, Henry. You framed this. You did, didn't you? Well, what about it? Suppose he did? Did you? Now listen, Henry. Get this straight. If Potter didn't want you you wouldn't have the job. Potter? Potter wanted me because you told him to want me. I told him about you, yes. And he agreed to see you. But you sold yourself. What was the idea? To get me out of the way? Or to have them slip me a dose of .. Bula-bula or whatever the native poison is down there? Have I got you pegged right or not? Henry. Potter liked you and he hired you. I don't do business with him so he is under no obligation to me. Now, you can take the job or not, as you like. But you would be foolish if you didn't. Well, I am not taking it. What? Henry, please. Henry, you could have a great future in South America. And you've waited for this chance so long. Bill thinks his money empowers him to dispose of other people's lives. Well, he is not going to dispose of mine. I have been waiting for this chance. All my life. And when it came I said to myself .. At last somebody recognises my ability. My ability? What a laugh that is. I will go home with him and talk to him. I am sorry. I think I can bring him around better than anybody. I wouldn't have had this happen for anything in the world. Don't you worry, Bill. That was a fine, generous thing you did. Only it didn't turn out right. That's all. I think Henry appreciates what you did for him, Bill. If you ask me I think he's acting like a big cluck. I think we'd better go, Pa. No. Wait, Ma. Please. Let's not go yet. Let's not break up the party. There is no reason why you children can't stay. Thank you, Bill. Goodnight. Goodnight, Bill. - Goodnight. I beg your pardon, Mr Harrison. That cake was not a success? Alec, that cake was probably one of the most successful cakes ever baked here. It blew them right off the roof. Bill. Bill. Please let's dance. Come on. Please. Please. - Alright. Let's dance. Tom, be a good guy will you and beat it. After I knock this Harrison's teeth out. Well, it's none of your business. Helen had a date with me and he made her break it. She broke it herself. After all, she's not married to you. Well, she's going to be. And no playboy is going take her around to swell hotels and shows. She goes where I want her to go. And if I don't go she stays home, see. She's in a taxi. - What does she do, walk home? Oh. Hello, Tom. Look. What do you think you're doing? - What do you mean? You fold up and keep out of this. - Tom. Will you go home. I'm going to learn you not to fool around with my fianc?e, bigshot. I am not your fianc?e. - I told you to shut up. Wait a minute, Tom. That's no way to talk to the girl you're going to marry. Don't tell me what do. I am telling you. I am going to smack you right between those baby blue eyes. You mean you want to fight me on account of Helen? I'm not going to fight you. I'm going to beat your brains out. Wait a minute. Yellow too, huh? Satisfied, stupid? Good morning, Ma. - Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Henry. - Hello. I'll get you some fresh coffee here. - Thank you, Ma. Where is Joan? The working brigade has departed. Any leads? No. Nothing but bond salesmen. You know, Henry. If it hadn't been for me and that Brazilian bust. You wouldn't have given up your last job. I was on the verge of quitting anyway. I only wanted to give you a chance to prove yourself. Sure you did. You just didn't think about it from my viewpoint. I'm doing a lot more thinking than I used to at that. Thanks to you, Henry. Ah. Those industrial accident statistics you quoted last night. Are they on the level? Absolutely. Thank you, Ma. You take hospitalisations .. - You let Bill eat his breakfast, Henry. That is alright, Ma. Just to show you the injustice. You take a millionaire's appendix. It goes wrong. What happens? They take him to the hospital, cut it out and charge him $15,000 for the job. And he never even feels it. Never feels it? - Paying the bill, I mean. Oh. Now then, you take your poor laborer's appendix that starts acting up. He goes to a clinic. The same surgeon operates on him but doesn't charge him a dime. So he doesn't feel it either, does he. Uhuh. But. Get between them. Look at the other 80% of the population. Me for instance. The great middle class. Let's assume that my appendix goes haywire. Sooner or later I've got to come across with five hundred smackers. Before I pay it I go without clothes and starve myself to death for a year. Is that fair? No. - Yeah. Coming down town? Thanks. I'll ride as far as Union Square with you. I'm making that my headquarters for today. Good morning, Miss Thayer. - Good morning. No, no. Sit there. I had a very interesting discussion with Henry on the way down. That starts the day now, does it? Since you moved in with us I've lost you to Henry, Bill. Are you jealous, Miss Thayer? Oh, Bill. Now, Miss Thayer, I have a very busy day ahead of me. I want you to give me a complete list of all my holdings. Also the folder on the Scarborough property. What for? My dear Miss Thayer. A well-trained secretary never asks what for. I also want my current bank balances and broker accounts. I .. think that just about covers it. Bill. What are you going to do? I can't tell you yet. But it is something that is going to make us all very .. Very happy. You mean Bill didn't come home at all last night? He didn't even telephone me. That is not like Bill. He acted so strangely at the office yesterday. Can you blame him, coming home to this Davenport? I'd bet anything he's asleep somewhere on a nice comfortable iron railing. Joan. Didn't he ..? - No. He didn't. I wouldn't be surprised if he went up to Maine to see his sister. And not even call me? Don't get yourself worked up, dear. I can't help it, Ma. I've lost Bill. He loves you, Joan. It's time you got him out of here and married him. Don't you worry, Ma. I will. If he still wants me. I was too proud to go away with him when he snapped his fingers. What's the good of pride that makes you a hypocrite to yourself? I love Bill, Ma. And that is all that counts now. There he is now. What is it? What has happened to Bill? - Isn't her here? No. He hasn't been home all night. This is Sally, Ma. Bill's sister. How do you do, Sally. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Hello. Hello. Has anything happened? A great deal has happened. What is the matter, Joan? - I don't know yet. This is my family. This is Bill's sister. Do you mean to say Bill has not said anything to you? About what? About giving all his money away? What? Giving all his money away? I don't understand. You mean that Bill is .. Giving all his money away, Mr Thayer. But why? Well, the big feature of his plans seems to be to endow a hospital. It will cost about 3 million dollars. The rest of his money it to go to start a foundation .. For the vocational training of the .. Of the great middle class? Yes. Something fantastic like that. Of course, he is out of his mind. The great middle class? You do know that Bill's disposing of all his properties for whatever he can get? And turning everything into cash. I don't know anything. He hasn't told me anything. His lawyer called yesterday to warn me. I drove all night to get here. You see, a lot of my money is wrapped up in those properties. And I'm not going to stand by and see them sacrificed. But Sally, he will listen to you. - I doubt it. His lawyer tells me he goes on raving about 'having found his life's work'. That this will be a monument to the Harrison name. You mean he's turning everything into .. - I don't believe it. What can we do? I would take our lawyer's advice. He says if Bill won't listen to reason .. We just bring him into court and prove that he's incompetent. Sally, you wouldn't do that? I certainly would. I am on my way to Mr Stanton's office now. He suggested that I bring you. Yes. I won't be a second. I didn't mean for him to go crazy. All I did was explain to him about people like us. The 90 million people. He believed you and he's giving his dough away. But that isn't the idea. - Pardon me. Would you please tell Joan I will see her in the car. You big dope. If things aren't tough enough for Bill, you have got to fight with his sister. Half the time I was only kidding him. Kidding him? We get six million dollars in the family and you have got to kid him? I suppose it can't be helped that my brother had a jackass for a son. You leave my father alone. - Don't speak to uncle Phil like that. Then tell him to lay off of my family. Use that tone again and I'll give you the worse licking you ever had. Cut it out, cut it out. Miss Harrison waits downstairs, dear. - Alright, darling. Helen. Dear. I can't bear it. I can't. This was my one chance and now it's gone. Helen. I don't care. I am not Joan. I'm not a lady. I am just a jitterbug. Trying to kid myself that I'm happy. That everything is going to be alright. I wanted Bill to think that .. That I was pretty enough. And cute enough, so that I would have a chance too. I did have one night though. That night Bill took us to dinner. And that got spoiled. And then we went to the theater. And a lovely place afterwards. It was like looking at yourself in a dream. And that was spoiled. All because some big dumbell like Tom Grogan thinks he owns me. And I guess he does. I guess he does. Frank. We're late and I'm not even dressed yet. You mustn't go to work today, Helen. Oh yes I must, Ma. I am late but .. But I will give the floor manager a song and dance. Come in to breakfast, Henry. If I had some money .. I would hire a lot of guys to kick me around the block. Joan. Yes. Joan, what happened? Did you see him? No. Joan. I have been thinking. I talked him into it. Maybe I can talk him out of it. Maybe I could .. I don't know how or why .. He should have taken any of us seriously. But among us we have destroyed the reputation of .. Six generations of Harrisons. Love is wonderful I guess. But it can't survive seven people for one bathtub. Philip. Philip. What is it? Pa, what is wrong? - Let him alone, Joan. What is it? We got in late this morning and Hankey was waiting. I didn't like the way he started balling Pa out so I let him have it. He fired me. Then Pa chipped in and Hankey lost his temper. Pa explained about you and Bill so .. Hankey told Pa to retire on his son-in-law. When he said that, Pa went for him and nearly murdered him. We are both canned. But you can't blame me for this. Or can you? Mr Hankey didn't mean it, Pa. I've been with him since 1897. Even the morning of the big blizzard, I was there. Just Hankey and me. That was all. He will send for you tomorrow. He said I was getting too old. If I am old, what about him? Well, if he doesn't take you back .. There are lots of other places that will be glad to have you, Philip. I will be 61 years old next month. And I've got no job. I am not an old man. Sixty-one. That is not an old man. It is alright. It is alright, Pa. It's alright. Where are you going? I am going to see Mr Hankey. Here is Bill. Hello, darling. - Welcome home, Bill. Now, that is what I call a salute. Come on. Sally is waiting for us. Sally? Don't pretend, darling. I have been with her all day. Well, don't pay any attention to anything Sally says. You are never going in there again. What's wrong? Bill, don't you know Sally is going to have you declared incompetent? Well, I have been for years. But not anymore. I never earned a dollar of that original money and neither did she. Come on. - I won't let you do this. Joan, I adore you. But I can't let you tell me what you will or won't let me do. Bill, it isn't because of your money. I don't want it. Not a cent of it. I love you and .. I can't have you go through a horrible scandal because of me. Oh, darling. Please, please. If you don't understand perhaps the others will. Hello. Where are the folks? - Listen, Bill. You're wrong to go to extremes. Extremes? Do you know what I'm doing? - Yeah. Giving all that good dough away. I thought you would be proud of me. A non-profit hospital for the small salaried man. Hello. - Hello. The finest equipment in the world. And the cost in proportion to the salary. Isn't that what you want? - Yeah. But it can't be done. It's not practical. Is that so? Then I shouldn't waste time telling you the really important part of my plan. You're crazy, Bill. One man can't do everything. Besides. Nobody would thank you for it. They'll just laugh at you. Is that so? Do you all feel the same way about it? Sure. You oughtn't throw away your dough on a lot of cockeyed schemes. Gee, Bill. You've got something when you have got money. If you haven't you are a blank. A zero. Well, I suppose you are right. Coming with me, Joan? Where, Bill? First, we must convince most of the mass people trying to stop us. And after that. We might be able to do something in this real world that truly benefits humanity. I still think humanity is a wonderful thing. Even though the people are disappointing. Are you sure you want to stick by me while I fight this thing through? Yes, Bill. I will go anywhere and do anything that you say. This home is always yours, Bill. We'll be glad to have you stay with us. Thank you, Ma. But I don't think I would be able to sleep here now. I might hear the echoes of things that were once said. Fine words. Noble words. Might come back with a hollow mockery. Come, dear. Say. Was that hollow mockery stuff a crack at me? I can't get used to the idea of not going downtown. It seems like a Sunday. I'm going. Goodbye, Ma. Goodbye, Pa. - Goodbye, dear. [ Buzzer ] Sally. Good morning. Are you all here? Why, yes. They're in having breakfast. Hello, everybody. - Hello, Sally. Hello. I hate to disturb you but as you're also involved in this plan of my brother's .. I do ask you to come along with me. Come along? - Where? Several details have to be attended to immediately. I ask you to hurry please. But I have to go to work. I'm afraid this must come first. We will go with you Miss Harrison. Right away. Thank you. A nice road. How far up the river does it go? About as far as Sing Sing. Will you follow me. Please. Let's hope we are not too late. Welcome, Thayers. Ha-ha. Nice work, Sally. So we tricked you out of your den, did we? Tricked us? So, you're not giving your money away? - I certainly am not. I wanted to show you your new home. Before you open your trap, Henry. Let me tell you you're not getting this for nothing. You pay for it with the profits from the hardware company you and I are starting. Then you're not putting up a hospital? - I certainly am. A half mile back there 4 other gentlemen and myself are building a hospital. For the exclusive benefit of the great middle class. That was a swell idea of yours, Henry. Did you know we can take out your appendix for 23 dollars and 85 cents? And at that, the 85 cents is a profit. Welcome home, everybody. Oh, Ma. Let's sit down. Bill, I don't know what to say. - No-one has to say anything. Except .. I will. Frank, will you let me invest in you to the extent of an aviation course? Helen. Will you let Sally take you over? And Henry, for Pete's sake will you get on a boat and go to Brazil. Everybody say it together please. I will. I will. Bill. Did you and Joan get married last night? Oh, my. I knew I forgot something. No, Pa. But we will this afternoon. Sally can you lend you her dress. I'll get married in my own dress thanks, Bill. Your own ..? Alright. If you aren't the toughest family to kick upstairs I ever saw in my life. Bill Harrison, you're right. I'll get married in a pair of overalls, standing on my head or any way you like. I am cured. We are all cured. - Great. Ma, I forgot to tell you. You, of all people. Look. You liked the Hilda so well, she is yours. Oh, Bill. Now, now. Not a word. The look in your eye is something no-one could ever deserve. Bill. I have been thinking. I'm not so sure about Brazil, see. Do you think they could make it the Argentine? ..w-g..
