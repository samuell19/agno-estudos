It's my boat. When I get it fixed up. It's 1964. It's got a mahogany hull. It's a racing class. God, this place is really depressing. No wonder they're closing it down. My, um... My sister's here. Molly. Ya. So... Are you picking up a relative? Excuse me? Mr. McKay?Yes. I'm Dr. Prentice. We were beginning to think that maybe you wouldn't show. The other patients left days ago. Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy. Is he okay? He's been very happy here, Mr. McKay. Yeah, I guess ignorance is bliss, right? Of course, everyone is a little agitated about having to leave. An orderly will be bringing Molly down shortly. However, I thought we might have a little chat first. Yeah. Sure. Hello, Domingo. I think he was singing the same song then. We still know very little about Molly's condition. Every patient's unique. The way she relates to certain people, even on an emotional level, suggests mental retardation. In other respects, she's autistic. But over the years she's become quite high functioning. Which is why, with a little help, she should be able to adjust to life outside an institution like this. She even has minor savant-like talents. I know. She recites stuff verbatim. She's Dustin Hoffman. But the fact is, she's pretty much non-functional, right? In recent years, Mr. McKay, you haven't spent much time with Molly. So, what I need to know are her basic needs and how to affect them so that she can be comfortable, and I... Can have a life. Thank you. I've copied out the daily routine that Molly feels most comfortable with. That routine is very important for Molly. We'll be monitoring her progress on a daily basis, at least, the next few weeks. You need to remember that, like many autistic people, Molly has very acute hearing. Loud noises can be extremely painful to her. Hi, Molly. Molly, do you remember Buck? Your brother? No. Don't you remember last Christmas, Moll? I took you out for a walk. No. Well, I guess we should go, then. Come on, let's go. Off we go. No! Mr. McKay, let her go. May I speak with Molly? Alone? For a minute? May I? Molly, come here. Who is this guy? Sam's been with us the past couple of years. He has a severe learning disability. He communicates with Molly on a level I don't fully understand. He's sort of her interpreter. Her guardian angel. Thank you for your help. Bliss, Mr. McKay. Don't hesitate to call. This is home, Moll. Hi. It's Jennifer.Look at this, Moll. I'm gonna bring round those comps for tomorrow but I'm gonna be working late... Lights. So I don't know what time I'll get there. Big kiss! Molly wet. Wet! What's wet? Pants! Molly wet pants. Dr. Prentice, you didn't tell me she was still wetting herself. This was not part of the deal. It's a reaction to the breaking of her routine. Well, how long is this reaction going to go on? The sooner she settles down, the sooner this sort of thing will stop. Thanks. For crying out loud. Come on. Okay, um... So, are you gonna take 'em off? No. Okay, what am I supposed to do here? Um... Okay. Molly? Come on. Molly... Gotcha. Here it is. Okay. Hold on for a second, okay? Moll, you hungry? Yes, Molly hungry. You like pizza? Molly like peas. No, not peas. Pizza. Peas! No. Pizza. See? Pi-i-za. Peas. Whatever. Peas! Peas! Molly, be quiet. Okay, now what time does the presentation start? Shit.Shit! I thought it was 10f30. Prescott told me it was 10:30. What time does day care open? All right. I'll see you tomorrow. All right? Bye. Pizza. Starch, modified flour, mononitrates, disodium insonate, tumeric, disodium guanylate. I've been eating that? Come on, Molly. Buck's late. Buck's late. Buck's late. Moll, careful. It's slippery. Come on, Molly! Hi. Are you the person in charge here? Yes. Joyce Leslie. Joyce! Right. I'm Buck McKay, 16th floor. My assistant, Brenda, called you about enrolling Molly. Yes, of course. Is Molly here? Yeah. She's right here. She's got her bag and if you need anything, you have my number. Okay then. Bye, Moll. Mr. McKay, is this some sort of a joke? Mr. McKay? Yes? Is this a joke? No. This is not a child, Mr. McKay. I know. Yeah, but she has the mind of a child. Mr. McKay, we're just not equipped to handle Molly. I'm sorry. Good-bye. Sorry. Molly, Molly. No! Molly, no. Bite me. You're late, Mr. McKay. Buck late.I know. Miss Duffy, this is my sister, Molly. Can she sit here, while I... Come on, sit down here. Come on. Sit down. Okay. Thank you. Molly. Sit down. I'm gonna be right in there, okay? You wait for me. There's nothing new in the juxtaposition of contrary images. But in this campaign, the hula girl and the Eskimo, the luau and the igloo, give us unique comic possibilities for years to come. Now that he's deigned to join us, let me introduce Buck McKay. Buck. Excuse me. May I help you? Molly hot. Hot. Hot. The follow-up campaign reverses the situation, and plants our favorite igloo, smack in the middle of Redondo Beach. Polar Pete, of course, has got his best baggies on. The wife, Hula's, got great bikini range. Possibilities here for infinite varieties. You could have a different swimsuit for every beach. East and west of Waimea Bay. Out they come, Polar Pete and... Molly hot, Buck. What's going on here? What happened? I was in...Don't talk. Just get her dressed. Molly hungry? Peas-a. Bren? You go take her out for pizza, and then take her to my place. Molly, I'll be there as soon as I can, okay? My God. Good morning, Sharon. Good morning, Buck. Georgia. What's up? Big trouble.What happened? The ice cream account went to Beresford and Weir. Prescott wants to see you. Great. I put these in the cupboard... No! Mr. McKay. Mr. McKay, I...It doesn't mean anything, Carmen. I don't know what's wrong with her. Did you talk to your sister about babysitting Molly? I don't think she would do it. Know what you mean. Sorry, Bren. Hey, it's okay. Hi, Molly.Hi, Molly. How was it?Fine. We watched the "flying monkey" scene from The Wizard of Oz like six times. It's one of her favorites. Thanks for this. I'm gonna miss you. You're a good boss. You're a good liar. Okay. Bye, Molly. Bye, Molly. Well, I guess this is it. See you later. So I talked to this guy. He's one of our sponsors, and he's fine with you workin' at home. Writing copy... I don't want to work part-time at home. I want to get out. I understand that, but in the meantime, this will tide you over. I'm living like a hermit. And when I do go out, I feel guilty. It's okay. Ooh, Molly, dog. Look at his eyes, Molly. Nice dog. Molly. They're toys. They're toys. They're not real. it's okay. All she does is channel-surf. Or she lines up her shoes. Yeah, it's like living with Imelda Marcos. And she knows. She's not completely out of it. She knows I'm goin' stir crazy. Moll. Got a surprise for you. Molly. Got a visitor. Hey, Moll.Hi. Hi. I'll leave you to it. She was reading to me. Robinson Crusoe. Be great if she had any idea what it was about. You'd be surprised, Mr. McKay. Look, I got a job. At the Kerrans Institute. Yeah? Yes. Dr. Prentice, he got me the job, and actually, he's been calling up, asking... Well, recommending Molly for one of their new programs. Yeah. Yeah. Really? That sounds good. I mean, it would be up to you, of course, but, if they... Well, if they found her suitable, they'd take her off your hands. For a while, anyway. I know. It's hard, Mr. McKay. Anyway, it's a little bit self-serving for me. I have a learning disability. Maybe because of that, we're kind of on the same wavelength. When she reads to me, I see the words. Right here in front of me. It's a real person in there, Mr. McKay. And she wants to come out. Mr. McKay?Yes. I'm Dr. Brookes. Hello.Hi. Hello, Molly. Hello, Molly. I've discussed Molly's history in great detail with Dr. Prentice. Right. He said that she was an ideal candidate for this. Well, we need to determine that now with our own series of tests. You know, Dr. Brookes, Molly has some extraordinary talents. The tests actually include a series of PET scans of Molly's brain, so, I have some forms that I need you to fill out. Sure. We make a tiny incision in the skull, right here. Using a probe, we transplant a set of genetically re-engineered cells, hopefully restoring the dormant area of the brain to partial utilization. Will she be able to look after herself on her own, for example? That's a definite possibility. But there's always a risk in any operation and with the brain those risks involve stroke, paralysis, motor functions. They're rare, but they do happen. How rare? In perhaps six percent of the cases. Six percent? This has gotten way out of hand. I mean, I may be a selfish schmuck, but you're my sister. Selfish schmuck. This is a life-or-death issue, Moll. I mean, you're happy some of the time, aren't you? No! Am I just wanting this for myself... ...'cause I'm a little inconvenienced? But it would give you a chance to have a better life. Hi, Susan. Hi, Molly. You can undress behind the screen. I don't know. Know what I mean? There he is. Hey, man. What's the word? Still operating. How are you? So, we're just gonna hang out here. You're gonna stay here? Everything all right? Yeah, she's fine. How you doin'? Ouch? Dr. Brookes! Dr. Brookes! What's happening? What's goin' on? Lorezepam, phenytoin, two and one. Got it. Mr. McKay, get out of here, please. ank you. Lita, I want Dr. Simmons in here. Dr. Simmons, ICU, stat. Okay, that's it. That's it. It's okay, Molly. It's gonna be okay. I just got off work. She had some kind of seizure. Yeah, I heard. But it's gonna be okay. What makes you so sure? Mr. McKay, sometimes, I have a sense of things. And I feel something extraordinary is going to happen. Mr. McKay? She's resting now. We have no idea what caused that reaction. We almost lost her, didn't we? She's all right now. She could have died, right? I'm not going to sleep with you. I'm not planning on either of us getting much sleep. And I'm certainly not going to sleep in that bed. Not without giving the mattress a good airing first. Hi.Hello. You can ask Fiona. All right, I will. Fiona! Molly, are you ready for more tests? No. Our projections show that the red dot should now be about the size of a dime. I'm afraid the grafted cells didn't take. So, what happens next? In a few weeks, we'd like to try again, in a slightly different location. Are you serious? Yes. After what happened last time? Buck, we're breaking new ground here. We learned so much from that last procedure. Yeah, by drilling into people's heads like they're lab rats. My sister nearly died. I am not going to let her go through something like that again. Goddamn son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Damn son of a bitch! Damn son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!Son of a bitch! Molly cold. Yeah, I know you're cold, Molly. Molly cold. Yeah, Molly, I know that you're cold, but the car won't start, okay?Molly cold! Would you shut up? Shut up, Molly!Molly cold! No! Just... Goddamn it! I didn't ask for this! I didn't ask for you! So shut up! No. No. No! I'm sorry, Moll. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nothing good on, Moll? Nothing good on? Let's go for a ride. Want to go for a ride? No! "There is nothing wrong with your television set. "Do not attempt to adjust the picture. "We are controlling transmission. "You are about to experience the awe "and mystery which reaches from the inner mind "to the outer limits." What do you think? Looks like the Milky Way just fell out of the sky. Moll? Four million, eight hundred thousand, three hundred and two. What? Stars. Here it is. The list. The list. Can you say, "The list"?No. It's okay. You don't have to. Okay. The plan is, while I look for a job, you will become self-sufficient. Cool? No. Hot! Yeah, okay. This is a list of things you need to learn. Understand? No.Good. Now, as you can see I've divided it into the basics. We have personal hygiene, recreation and eating. Now, every time you complete a task, we put a check mark in the box beside it. You see? No! Now, when you get all the boxes checked, you get to take a trip in Buck's boat! Let's try it. Okay. Um, what is your name? Molly! That is fabulous. See, now, I'm making a big red check mark in the box beside, "Says name when asked." Okay, next. Um, where do you live? Here!Absolutely correct. But you need to learn your actual address to get a check mark. Tying shoes? That's getting a little ahead. No... Yes! Tie shoes. All right, tying shoes it is. Okay. You take the two ends and make the incredibly difficult and death-defying overhand knot. Molly try. Molly? Right, you make the loop. Good. What do you do after that? You go around the loop. Remember, nobody's ever done this on the first try. Okay, try again. Try again. Okay, what do we do first? We'll try again tomorrow, okay? No. You go to bed. Sleep tight. Now, jump! Mr. McKay! Go on, dance. Go on. Molly! Molly. Holy shit. My name is Molly McKay. I live at 200 Mildred Avenue, Venice, California 90291! If you look over to the last image, that's present. And we had no idea there'd be that amount of cell growth. ...three! I think it's going to rain. Yes, it's getting darker by the minute. Yes, it's getting darker by the minute. Was that a flash of lightning? Was that a flash of... ...lightning? Flash of lightning. Lightning. "But I needed none of all this precaution, "for never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant "than Friday was to me. "Without passion, sullenness, or designs, "perfectly obliged and engaged, "his very affections were tied to me, "like those of a child to a father, "and I daresay he would have sacrificed his life "for the saving of mine on any occasion whatsoever." Hello, Buck. Why do they put died people in the ground? Dead people. Dead people. It's a religious ritual. There are a lot of people in the world. Yeah. Well, if they all die, then eventually the world's gonna be one big cemetery. That's a good point. Some people are cremated. Cremated? Burned They're dead. It doesn't hurt. How do you know? That's a good question. I wish I knew what they were like. Yeah, but they say they're in a better place now. The ground is not a better place, Buck. You know, before, I lived in a hospital... Well, it was more like a home. Yeah, for people like me. And you waited until you had room, and then you came to get me? Yeah. You see, the home got its money from the government. And one day, the government just decided to close it down. Do you think they can feel us lying on them? Maybe. I'm really glad we're getting out. Yeah!Yeah. I'm changing. I have all these emotions that I don't really understand. There's some things that I wanted to talk to you about. What things? Well, I'm getting smarter by the minute. That's nothing to worry about. Yeah. I'm reading a lot of books. That's a good thing! My vocabulary is growing exponentially. Good word! Thank you. What's a blow job? A reminder, Dodger fans, next Wednesday is family night...Right here. So plan on being here. As your Los Angeles Dodgers continue their quest for the Western Division title. Hey, batter, batter, batter! Swing! Yeah! Go, Dodgers! Go, Dodgers! Whoo! Whoo!Whoo! Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Yeah! High inside. High inside. Hey, you hungry?Yes. All right. Stay here and watch the game. Wait! I don't understand the game yet. Okay. See that guy there?- He throws the ball at a guy right there...- Who tries to hit it with the bat.The bat. If he does, he has to run to the base before those guys can throw the ball to the base. And if he touches the base before the ball arrives, he's safe. Safe?Safe. Safe from what? From being out. Out of what? I'll explain when I get back. It's a weird game, Buck, but I like it! Yes! Go, baby! Safe! You dumb shit, ump! He was out by a mile! Sit down! The man dropped the ball. What, have you got binoculars on your eyes? No.What are you, some kind of retard? I'm an irregular retard. And you? Wiseass. A wiseass retard. I'm not familiar with that. What's going on? Having a disagreement with that wiseass retard. Look at 'em go. Man, I wish I could hear what they were saying. Come on, what's goin' on? Who are you? Ray Charles? He was out by 10 feet. "He was out by ten feet." He dropped the ball, dick nose. "He dropped the ball, dick nose!" He dropped the ball.Get outta my face. "Get outta my face!" "No, you get outta my face." Your breath smells like the shithouse door on a tuna boat. "Your breath smells like the shithouse door on a tuna boat." My God! This is the best part of the game so far. That was a great game. Will you take me again? Absolutely. You're the best brother in the whole world. I'd like to wake up with you in the morning. Feel the stubble on your chin, your hot breath on my cheek...Molly! What? We're brother and sister. So? We'll talk about it later. Brothers and sisters can't get married. Why not? 'Cause that's the way that things are. Why? There are scientific reasons. People with the same genes can't mix them. We don't have the same jeans. I don't even wear jeans. It's... It's a different meaning. It's G-E-N-E-S. It's a different spelling. I know about them. Genes provide the blueprint for what organisms become. Where did you get that from? I read a lot of scientific books. Like Jackie Collins. So what can brothers and sisters do if they like each other a lot? They can be friends. For life. That's all? That's a lot. How come we weren't friends before? I guess we didn't know each other that well. You wanna dance? No. This is not a place where you dance. Yes, it is. Molly... Molly, sit down. Come on. Molly... Come on, sit down. Race you to the door! Hey! I'm right behind you! Be careful! I won! Hi, Molly.Hey, Jim. Mr. McKay, Dr. Brookes wanted to see you in her office when you got in. Thanks, Jim. You cheated. I did not cheat. Good night.Good night. Hi. She's supposed to be in bed by 8:00. We got sidetracked. She asked me to marry her. What did you say? No. Stop it, Buck. Okay? Please. This isn't funny. No. It's the first time anybody's gone through something like this, and we have no idea how she's gonna react to all this stimuli. We just have to take things very slowly. I'm sorry. She's wonderful. I want to thank you for... ...giving her to me. Thank you. For the first time in my life I feel kind of blessed, I guess. Thank you. You haven't said how it was today. I don't know how much she remembers. Well, ask her. So that gives a complete analysis of the components of the blood, right? That's right. Where did you find out about this? I have all these books up here. Now when I play them back, I can finally understand them. How do you mean, "Play them back"? They're like videos. Where did you read all these books? At the home? Every book on Dr. Prentice's shelf. So, did you have a nice time with Buck last night? Yes, I did. Thanks. The old room 306. Hello, Lauris. Whatever are you doing here, James? What do you think he's doing, Lauris? Guessing your weight? You thought perhaps what?Duh! Hi, Molly. Wanna go shopping? No. Can't. Okay. Are you going out? Yeah. I'm going out with Sam. Do I look weird?No, you look good. Let me show you something. What? Well... I'm gonna take these off.Why? Because you already have eyelashes, and they're perfectly beautiful, just the way they are. See, Molly, the purpose of makeup is to accentuate your strong points. But I don't have any strong points. My eyes are too close together. No, they're not.I look like a baboon. You do not look like a baboon! Yeah, I do. I do! I saw one on TV. Probably my great-great-grandfather. Why do you say that? 'Cause we're descended from them, aren't we? Probably had big blue bottoms that would grow bigger when we wanted to have sex. Well, our bottoms do tend to get bigger, but not just when we want to have sex, unfortunately. Okay. That's good. My God! He's early! Come in! Hi, Dr. Trehare. Hi, Sam. Is Molly here? Yeah. She's... Why don't you... Why don't you have a seat? All right. Why, Sam, whatever are you doing here? I thought we were going for a walk. Why, yes, I do believe you are correct. Fiddle-dee-dee. Sorry.Excuse me. Sam?Yes? Do you like me? Yeah. Yeah. I like you. Well, then, how come you've never... ...kissed me? Well, I, um... 'Cause, you know, when people like each other, they're supposed to kiss. Well, yeah. I guess so. I mean... I know how to do it. You do? Yeah. Well, I know how to... Well, I know that. You want to do it? Well, I mean, it's not something that I... That does... Wait. Okay. What?Nothing. Molly?What? I'm just... I'm gonna go to work. Bye. See ya. See ya. Bye. Sam?Yeah? Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine, Dr. Brookes. Just a little... ...anxious, that's all. Scarlett got you on the run? It's okay. It's okay. Just... Yeah, it's coming off. A little bit of lipstick. Hello? Jackie Collins is right, you know. There is an epidemic going on. Of what? Beverly's boyfriend is sleeping with half the women in town, and Susan is cheating on you, with Sam. What? Hello, Molly."Hello, Molly." Is something wrong? A problem? Problem. Something needs airing? No, the only thing that needs airing is your mattress. Molly, what...Do you think I don't know? You just stay away from him, you slut!Molly... Isn't it enough that you're trapping my brother into a meaningless relationship?What? If I ever see you near Sam again, I swear to God, I will... Molly, you're being jealous. I am not being jealous! It's okay. It's a normal adolescent emotion. I am not an adolescent! I am a 28-year-old woman! God, why can't you understand that? Why can't you understand me? Molly? Molly, it's okay. We've all been there. I just felt like... ...before. Before? Before you fixed my brain. Moo, moo. Hello, Domingo. Thank you, Sam. Sure, Janet. Hi. Hi. Sorry about yesterday. Me too.Yeah. Me too. I know I was a little weird. No, I was... Um... Well, I just hope that we don't have to be embarrassed. No. I mean, it's still us, right? Yeah. Whatever happens, it... It's... Whenever you're ready. Not now. No. Whenever you feel ready, then you can kiss me. Will you... Will you kiss me back? Absolutely. What time do you get off work? Two o'clock. Will you be my date? Yes. Good. Bye.Bye. Forbidden fruit. I think. You smell like an animal. Thank you. These are a more youthful kind of perfume. Do you like it? Yum, yum. Well, that's our entire range. Which one did you like the best? We'll, think about it. Thanks. Eyes, look your last! And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death! No! Romeo, stop! She's... She's asleep! She's not even dead! She's just asleep! Stop! Juliet, wake up! Wake up! Juliet, wake up! See? She's okay. Jeff, can I get some help here?What are you doing? See? It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. I got her. What am I supposed to do? She almost knocked my teeth out. Whoa! Whoa! Are you all right?What? What's wrong? You all right? It's okay. We got her. At the beginning, I knew it was a play, but it became very real. I'll have the Irish Smoked Salmon I would love to be in love like that.and the Maine Lobster. Wouldn't you? Absolutely. So passionate. Here, nobody ever says how they feel about anything. I mean, look at those two people over there. They have not said a word to each other since they sat down. Look at them!Shh. Well, they're obviously angry at each other. Why don't they just say something? I just wish they'd scream. If everybody screamed when they wanted to, the whole world would be a madhouse. At least it'd be more honest. Sir? I'll have the mussels and the tournedos. Medium rare. Madam? Molly. And what's your name? Richard. Have you chosen? I'm gonna have the mud cake. Chocolate mud cake. And then the key lime pie. And to begin? I'm gonna have the chocolate mud cake. And then the key lime pie. Sir? I saw the greatest dress.Sir? Yes? Order? I'd like a coffee. And? Black. Yeah. Sam, aren't you hungry? I'm starving. No. Coffee's fine, thank you. Sam, it's okay. I'm treating. Seriously. I know the prices here are outrageous, but that's why I do the stuff I do, so we can come to places like this. Go ahead. Coffee's gonna be just fine for me, thanks. Okay. Molly, is something wrong? There was just a silence. I screamed for all of us. Sam doesn't want any food. I thought Romeo was beautiful. Yeah. Juliet was, not bad either, not that I noticed. How are these for size? Whoa! My God! Sam, get that one! Okay! They can't breathe out of the water! Get it away from me! Madam, please go back to your table. They're choking! You all right, Sam? Audrey, I could use some help here, please. I do apologize. And we will pay for the dry cleaning of that dress. Let's all drink to that. Those lobsters live in the tank. They're someone's pets. Why would you eat someone's pets? Well, Molly, I didn't think of it that way, but I'll try to do better next time. Thank you. Buck, will you dance with me? Why not? Sam dances well, doesn't he? Sam's great. Would you like him as a brother-in-law? I'd be honored. Good. 'Cause you're gonna have to give me away. Dad says it's okay. Dad? Yeah. I talk to them in my dreams. They're not in the ground anymore. Once you die, at least you don't get any older. That's one good thing. Are you sure you want to see this? Yeah. I do. Honey, you want to come give your present to Moll? Buck. Buck. Come on over, Buck. Come on, sweetie. It feels nice and soft. Can you guess, Moll? What's this one, Moll? Let's see. I wonder what it is. What is it? Sweetie! Yeah, it's a bunny, Moll. Sweetheart, look at the bunny. Look at that little soft bunny. He's the cutest little bunny. Buck, come over to the table. Come on. In the world where I come from, nothing's predictable. Sometimes everything's crowding in on you. So you have to hunch in on something small and certain and safe. In your world, almost everything's controlled. But for us, it's all a jumble, and sometimes, you just have to scream. So people look at you strangely and talk about you as if you're not even there. But... ...you always know what they're saying. They get very upset when you scream, but often, I know that they would just like to scream themselves. I think that's what I find most strange about this world. It's that nobody ever says how they feel. They hurt, but they don't cry out. They're happy, but they don't dance, or jump around. And they're angry, but they hardly ever scream. Because they'd feel ashamed, and... Nothing's worse than that. So we all walk around with our heads looking down and never look up and see how beautiful the sky is. Hey! Very... So, what's actually happening? Well, her immune system is attacking the new cell growth. It's not something we expected because they originated from her own genetic material. The problem is to identify a suppressant which will switch off that part of the immune system in the time frame that we have. Well, why not shut the whole thing down? She'd die of a cold in a week. Look, you did this thing to Molly, okay? What are you saying, exactly? There is a chance of the whole process completely reversing. This is crazy. I mean, she is not gonna go back to what she was, okay? We gotta work at this and we gotta stop this thing. There was always the possibility of this happening, Buck. You knew that in the beginning. No, I didn't know that you were gonna create a whole new person and then just give up on her. She was always a person, Buck. What in the hell are we gonna tell Molly about this? I think she knows, Dr. Simmons. I think she's known for quite a while. I felt some things. But it was just in the last few weeks. Why didn't you say something? I don't know. 'Cause I was scared. Moll... You're not going back. I'm not gonna let you. All right, you're here and you are my sister, and... We're gonna get through this thing together. Aren't we? I don't know. No. We're gonna beat this thing. I'm so scared. I'm really scared. I'm... I don't want to go back. I don't want to lose all this. I don't want to lose you. You won't lose me. You have to go and find somebody else. You do. No, Moll...Yes, you do. It's not gonna be any different than how it was before. No. You've seen how I am now. You're always gonna be thinking about that. Always gonna be thinking about how I could have been. No, I won't. Yeah, you will.Moll... You know why? Because I'll always know it's you... No matter what. Come on, Moll. I don't think I can do it. Yes, you can. Come on. Are you ready? Sit up here. Okay? Now just pedal, all right? Put your feet here. You got handlebars there. Just pedal, okay?No! No, we went riding yesterday. You can do this, okay? Come on, sit up here. I'm gonna give you a push start, okay? Then you just keep your balance and you pedal. All right?No. Yes. You can do this. Are you ready? Here we go. Come on. No! No!Yes. Come on. Come on. Come on, pedal. Pedal. Come on. Come on, you can do it. Keep your feet on the pedals. Moll, you okay? Molly! Are you all right? Are you all right? Come on. You did this yesterday. You can do it! Buck, you can't force her!Yes, you can! What are you doing? For God's sake! She's gonna ride this bike! What are you trying to do? She fell off the bike! I am not gonna let it happen! She is not going back to being a vegetable! Sam! Don't say that, Buck. Don't say that about anybody. I'm sorry about out there. Buck... You know when you used to come to see me every Christmas, you'd bring me a box of candies every year? Well, one year you brought me a hat. It was a yellow straw hat with ribbons on it. I loved that hat. But it blew off the first time they took me to the beach. Sailed up into the sky... Till next Christmas. You brought me another box of candies. You remember that? Of course I do. I waited for you to come all year. When Mom and Dad died, you didn't even... You didn't even seem to know it had happened. You'd still talk about them like they were still around. Maybe they were. I was 17, Moll. All those years that they had been, looking after you, I'd just go up to my room. When they died, I... I didn't know who you were. I hardly knew how to look after myself. I always wished that you'd bring your friends home. I wanted to meet them. I didn't want people to see you. I never told anyone I even had a sister. It'll still be me, Buck. I am gonna be just as much a person as I am now. I'll just be different. Hey. Hi there. It's looking good. You've done a lot of work. I'm taking it out for trials in two weeks. See if it floats. Do you need some crew? I wanted to tell you that we found a good place for Molly. It's sort of a halfway house. She'll be moving there at the end of the week. We'll all really miss her. But we'll be able to visit. I didn't know if you'd be here, so I wrote down the address. I'm sure she wants to see you. Would she know who I was? Well, you won't know until you go. Thanks. It's really close by. You liked it when we went there. No. There's all those big gardens. You'll be able to help pick all the lemons and the oranges. I'll come and see you every day, Moll. We'll be climbing all over those fruit trees. Thought I'd give you a lift to the new place. Is that okay, Susan? Of course. Got a job, Sus. I mean, it's not a great one, but I can pay off my debts. They repossessed the other car. I was gonna come with Molly, if that's all right. Sam, Molly go Buck. Yeah. Molly go Buck. Okay. See you. And, I will be needing that crew, if she's still available. She is. I thought we'd stop by on the way. Molly go Buck?Yeah. So... What do you think of the new layout, Moll? Good? No. Hey... Is this the right place for the bed? No. Forgot your cards. Nice light in here. See that light? Got enough shoes there to keep you going? No. And, I got, Carmen coming by every day. She wants you to give her dancing lessons. No. I'm hoping Sam's gonna be stopping by sometimes. Sam. So it's... It's gonna be quite a... A household. If you want to join it. Hello, Buck. Hi, Molly.
