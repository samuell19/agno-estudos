[News theme plays] [Sirens blaring] A government document released on Thursday reports that air traffic control errors have increased sharply. The faa is developing a high-tech satellite network that will take the danger out of flying. Interviewee: The acat is already handling the majority of military traffic with a perfect safety record, which will benefit civilian travel. Reporter: Critics call the new acat system an expensive boondoggle that will make us less safe, charging the faa gave its approval despite a limited test period. Will the new acat system eliminate human error and make air travel safer and more efficient? I guess we'll find out Monday when the acat satellite network takes control over the skies of the eastern seaboard, one of the world's busiest regions. Technician: ...2, 1. Reporter: The acat satellite will launch today from cape canaveral. [Rock music playing] * listen, pain has found us once again * [music stops] [Overlapping chatter] Region control, this is Cleveland. [Beeps] I got a broken satellite link that's, um, affecting communications. I'm worried this could be a malfunction with the acat system. Request permission to ground all air traffic. Region: Negative. We're handling the issue. Local only. Uh, region, we are local. Bob, we're handling the issue. Over. [Sighs] Region, this is Cleveland again. Look, this local issue, Stan, is now affecting Washington, D.C., to Cleveland. There's reports of airborne debris that's coming down in our sector. Look, I need to bring those planes down. Bob, you've had it out for the acat from the beginning. Oh, come on, Stan. I gotta bring these planes down. It is not safe. Orders stand. Sorry, Bob. Damn. Hell of a day to start your internship, huh? [Chuckles] Yeah. Stan: Bob, I just got word. Air force one is prepared for takeoff. Listen, I can't send the president out in this. That plane is a fortress. The acat is in full control. Damn. Air force one, you are cleared for takeoff, runway 27. Acknowledged, Cleveland. I could swear this computer's giving us the hairy eyeball. Thinks it doesn't need us. Another long one, huh? Whoa. I tell you it really was. Heh. You know, if that senator calls me again, i--obviously I don't know what to tell him. Well, he's always been long-winded, sweetheart. Yeah, he's very persistent, you know. These-- dad, why did the computer treat me like a complete terrorist when I tried to use the bathroom? Sweetie, it's just biometrics. Honey, please don't say, "terrorist." Whatever. Good evening, Mr. President, Mrs. Phillips, milani. Welcome aboard. Thank you. We've completed our upgrades. Your acat documentation, sir. Thank you, Joan. After our upgrades, air force one's a whole new plane. Wow. Can I get a tour? I'd be delighted miss Phillips. Cool. I expect a full report. [Laughs] Sir, please prepare for takeoff. President: Thank you, Joan. Mrs. Phillips: Thank you, Joan. Here we go. Just relax. Sir... Is everything okay? Let's hope I'm wrong and it's all smooth sailing from here. Boy, oh, boy. I tell you. [Crowd screams] What is this stuff? Come on, Bob. Pick up. [Line rings] [Sighs] Man. [Vibrating] I'll take this outside. I'll be back in five. Hey, Toni, is everything okay? Hey. Uh, I don't have a good feeling about this. I don't know if you heard. A satellite came down near the river. I think I found part of the acat. Bob: It can't be part of the acat. No, no. It's impossible. Well, it's hard to tell. It's badly burned. Look, I scanned all the morning reports. There was nothing about a-- a rogue satellite falling to earth. Well, it didn't just appear. Look, I need to be 100% sure, because if it's a part of the acat system, then I gotta notify the Pentagon, and that's not an easy call to take back. They should have listened to you, Bob. Point is we need to know for sure if it's the acat. This is just like you predicted. Yeah, well, let's hope I'm wrong. Look, give me about an hour to confirm. Look, thanks for calling, antonia. I gotta run. I got an intern. Sure. Bob: Americana blue 23, traffic 200 miles-- air force one. Maintaining visual scans. What an honor. Sharing the skies with air force one herself. Both be in Detroit. Maybe I'll drop off that astronaut application. Ohh. Sir, your pillow. Thank you, ma'am. Blanket? Sure. Thanks. Woman: Really don't like flying. It's gonna be okay. You all right? It's not like-- hey, I do this all the time. See? It's gonna be fine. Blanket? Here. Sir, would you like a blanket? Thank you. Hang on, okay? Ohh. Uh, I'll need access to that bag. Okay. I'm just gonna put it right here. Okay. Uh, just one second. Thanks. Hey, d-do you have markers? Oh, I've got a pen. Oh, excuse me. I'm really warm. Why is it so stuffy? Here you go. [Air hissing] Thank you. Excuse me. Do you have any magazines on fishing? Let me check. Thanks. Could you get me a pillow? Of course. Thanks. [Can opens] Bloody Mary for 3b. Heh. Whatever happened to rum and coke? [Chuckles] Thank you. Hey, what can I get for you? [Thunder crashing] Air force one, acat update. Be advised some systems may be affected. Acknowledged, Cleveland. Copilot: I don't trust this acat to fly our plane. Just don't spill any coffee on it. Might start a war. Climbing to level 29. The auto-controlled anti-threat program, or acat for short, can deploy a wide range of lethal and nonlethal weapons. Wow. This plane is amazing. I know it better than anyone. Why are you so interested all of a sudden? Gotta maintain my street cred. Hmm. First daughter has to brag about air force one. What's his name? Gage. I bet he's cute. Yeah. Yeah. He loves planes. Milani. Sandwiches? Hey, Lee. Staff sergeant. Gentlemen. [Door beeps] Did we just bust them getting sandwiches? Sweetie, when your dad's on a diet, we're all on a diet. He's not a king. I'm gonna show you something really cool. So did you see who's working the route with us? Heh. Yeah, that's a low-probability target. But a man's gotta try. Go get your coffee. Uh, hi. Hi, Ken. So what's the difference between captain Simms and a jet engine? A jet engine stops whining once it lands. [Chuckles] Um, coffee, I guess. Oh, of course. Sure. Let me know if you need a refill. So how'd it go with your in-flight girlfriend? Simms, you wouldn't understand. Neither will you unless you grow some balls and ask her out. Bob: Ab 23, ascend to flight level 27. Roger that. Climbing to level 27. Sir, could you please explain what you did with your traffic control for those planes? Look, why don't you show me what you think I just said? Okay. Both planes are headed for Detroit. Americana blue enters our sector here. Air force one enters here. Ehh. That should never happen. That's why you told americana blue to climb. Exactly. Oh, lord. What's happening now? [Sirens blaring] I can't believe these reports coming in. There are satellites dropping everywhere. This is way bigger than n.A.S. Thinks it is. I gotta bring these planes down. Hey, everybody. All planes are grounded. I'll take full responsibility. Region, this is Cleveland. I'm overriding. Air force one is cleared through. Do not impede the president. Listen, I can't take the risk. The risk is too high. Not your call, Bob. Stand down, or we will remove you. Bob: Hang tight. I'm going outside to make a call. [Line ringing] Come on. Pick up. [Dials] Bob, great. It's you. I don't have the best coverage out here, but, um, it sure is. It's a--it's a piece of the acat satellite. Yeah, we've already experienced the window. Wait. You're dark? No control. The planes? Grounded with few stragglers. Ah, damn it. It's the worst-case scenario, just like you predicted. No. It's worse, antonia. Uh, what are you thinking? Listen, how close is tamarack Ridge? Uh, 20 miles, maybe. Well, you need to get there in 30 minutes. There's a tower there. You need to mux an analog signal and create a shared medium. Why? What-- go home and bring your demux computers, pre-1980s. We need to band the signals together. If I can get the signal strong enough, I could talk to americana blue 23. Is one of the planes flying blind? Yeah, there's another one. But look, I can't talk about it on this line. It's not secure. Antonia? Antonia? [Static] Bob. Bob! Antonia? Antonia? Bob, are you there? [Beeps] Toni, can you hear me? ...just adjust the altitude accordingly. Okay. Well, this completes our tour of air force one, at least what I can share with you. That's so cool. I cannot wait to tell Gage. And you have to tell me what he says. I will. Especially the part-- he's gonna love-- [booming] What is this? A severe electrical storm? "Severe electrical storm" is one way to put it. That or the second coming. What's going on? Let's get you back to the suite. [Alarms blaring] Possible impact. Some systems are down. Emergency sequence. Engage acat. All right, acat engaged. Proximity clear. I'm sure it'll be just fine. You be careful. Thanks, milani. Nav's got her under control. Damage? Onboard outbound communication's 100% damaged, sir. We're not talking to anybody. Hull status? Hull's intact. Must have been some kind of lightning strike, sir. Cleveland control, please respond. Nothing. The acat's got it. Go down to communications control and see what you can find out. Roger that. Malfunction, colonel. It's locked. Attempting a manual override. Nothing. It's locked up. My controls, sir, they're not responding. Stage two, manual override. Nothing. Bob: Air force one, acat malfunction. You must override the system. Damn it. What? Air force one. Come in, air force one. This is Cleveland. Air force one, respond. But the Pentagon said not to do that. Shh. I thought a good controller follows orders. Sometimes a great controller uses his own judgment. It's all we have. Andrews air force base, Cleveland control. Emergency status Alpha. [Running footsteps] Captain yeagar, we need a commander on the ground. What's going on, lieutenant? Operation morning light, sir. All military personnel, operation morning light is a go. Report to the briefing room immediately. Sit-rep? You name it, and we've got it, sir-- power outages, communication problems. As the closest base to Cleveland atcc, we're the president's best hope of trying to reestablish contact with air force one. Wait. So the satellites could be entering our atmosphere? The f-16s should be escorting air force one down now. Now all I gotta do is find that civilian plane. [Horns honking] [No audible dialogue] I hope they remember my vegan dinner. [Chuckles] Aoki, my dinner eats vegans. Well, I hope it came with heart medicine. Oh, my god. Ab 23 is heading straight into the acat fallout zone. I gotta warn them. Americana blue flight 23, please, this is Cleveland control. Come in. Bob: Americana blue 23-- fire in the console. Losing power. [Engines power down] [Bell dings] Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seatbelt sign. Please return to your seats. Excuse me, sir-- don't touch me! Do not touch me! Okay. Okay, i--sir, sir, I need you to get back to your seat. No! Sir, please, on your chair, my newspapers. I need my newspapers. Sir-- just give me my newspapers. Here you go. Fasten your seatbelt, okay? Okay, okay. Excellent. Thank you very, very much. Please calm down, sir. Sir. We've lost both engines. [Passengers scream] Cleveland control, americana blue 23, mayday. Mayday. Two engines lost. I repeat-- two engines lost. [Screaming] We're stalled out. We're dropping. [Screaming] Americana blue, flight 23, please, this is Cleveland control. Come in. [Screaming] Go to forced start. Wind speed? 150 knots. [Screaming] Americana blue 23. Ascend flight to level 27 now. Mr. Abbot, what's that? It's getting really close. Oh, my god. Hey, we got a bogey coming in! Sir, radar is tracking unknown accelerating particles at grid coordinates 41-28-56. That's Cleveland, sir. Bob: Take cover let's go! Take cover! [Screaming] What are you doing? Windmill restart. Power's out. Got no choice. Airspeed? 225 knots. We need 300 to get the turbines started. We're not there. [Screaming] 245. [Screaming] 260. Come on. 265. Come on, baby. [Screaming] 295. [Screaming] [Whirring] Yeah! [Screaming] [Gasping] Man: What's going on? Woman: Oh, my god. Man: What's going on here? You crazy. You did it. We got her back. Regaining altitude. Radio? She's dead. Look, man, what happened? What made our engines shut down? We got no nav radio, no GPS. Man, we can't fly blind. Aoki, focus. What's our heading? We lost our beacon. Well, we lost our engine. We dropped out of our flight pattern. Well, without navigation, we're a crash waiting to happen. We're not gonna crash, aoki. Improvise. Okay. Where's the sun? Landmarks? S-searching. What was that? Go. What about you? I'm not leaving while there's traffic in the air. Another judgment call? You could say that. Then I'm staying, too. Radhika, just go. Be safe. I'm making my own judgment call, sir. All right, if you're gonna stay, let's see what we got left. Sit-rep, major? [Typing] No radio. Security doors nonfunctioning. Nav's okay. Proximity radar's functioning. Autopilot? Appears to be functioning. Lightning, huh? Let's pray it doesn't strike twice. Sir, my controls, they're still not responding. Get 'em back, major. I can't. That acat is in some kind of automatic mode. It won't let me make any adjustments. [Beep] Goddamn computers. That acat seems to think that no one's available to fly the plane. Are you telling me we're not in control of this plane? No, we're not. Best-case scenario, acat brings us to dtw and lands this plane for us. Activate the emergency beacon. We could activate it, but why? That beacon may be our only way to communicate. And I'm not willing to sacrifice the president's life based on some best-case scenario. Where's the president? Air force one is out of contact, but NORAD has scrambled 2 f-16s. Get f-16s in protection formation, and make them hot. Yes, sir. Tater, big bird one o'clock. Copy, kanga. He's 1-1-6, 20,000. We're a mile and a half in trail. Roger that, tater. All right, I found our beacon. Lock her in. Locking in beacon now. [Sighs] [Horns honking] I'll give you $100 for the bike. 200. And the watch. Don't you have a smartphone? It's broken. Fine. Here. Come on. Excuse me! Excuse me. National emergency! They're fried. They're all fried. Sir, i-it's never been used. Okay. It works. [Beeping] Oh, no. What? Ab 23 is off her flight plan. Okay. Air force one and americana blue are headed right for each other. Why aren't they locked on their beacon? Radhika, our beacon is out. Come on. Let's go. The acat is trying to eliminate human error, but it's misidentifying us as a threat. Disable it, sir? Negative. Let's not drop security protocol without verifying there is a threat. Security systems are fine. Reporting systems are down. All right. Well, I'll try to alert security about a possible acat malfunction. Sir, the acat marks two targets as hostile approaching, converging in 30 seconds. Roger that. Take defensive positions. Prepare to evade. Sir, our sidewinder engines are spinning, and I do not have any control, sir. Figure it out, major. It's our guys. Stand down. Stand down. F-16s, this is air force one. Do you copy? Sidewinders are in the tubes. Abort the missiles, major. 2 of our f-16s are marked hostile, and I cannot decode them. Air force one to f-16s. Do you read? Can they hear us? You are marked as hostile. Do you copy? Abort your mission immediately. Abort your mission immediately. F-16s, do you copy? Damn it. Com is dead. Move. Can't hear a goddamn word I'm saying. Get back. Get back. Move. Stop. Get back. Get back. No! Hon, shh, shh. The window. Shh, shh, shh. Stay quiet. Stay quiet. [Door closes] Oh, my--where's milani? Stay calm. I don't-- she's not here. I'll find her. Don't worry. [Alarm blaring] [Alarm blaring] [Rattling handle] [Yells] [Rings bell] Maintain control. Maintain composure. Dad. [Keypad beeping] They're off our radar. We have to alert the president. [Beep] [Beep] Agent Lee, agent Roberts, do you copy? [Static and squeals] Agent Lee, agent Roberts, do you copy? Damn it. The onboard systems are out. We've gone into lockdown mode. Monitors just went dead. [Coughs] Dad. Dad. Hmm? Sir, do you need some help? [Coughing] Hey. I think this guy's having a heart attack. He needs help now. [Gasps] Sir. Okay, let's get him up. Come on. Let's get him on down. It's okay. It's all right. I got him. Easy, easy. Sir, are you all right? Dad, you can help. It's okay. It's okay. I got his legs. Oh, careful. Careful. I'll get his legs. Unbutton his shirt. Shirt. Open his shirt. God! I'm sorry. You got it, ma'am. His shirt. I'm sorry. [Groaning] Okay. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Calm down. Breathe. No one can be touching him. Yeah, sir, gonna lay you down. Okay, no one touch his body. Hurry up. It--god, it's not working. Just try it again. Try it again. Can't you see the man's dying? Please, ma'am. Ma'am, please sit down. Come on. It's not working. Come on. Starting cpr. He's still breathing! 1, 2, 3. Has anyone got any aspirin or blood thinner? Breathe. Come on. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. What--unh! Uhh! [Groaning] Sir, I've tried everything, but the acat has taken complete control over the plane, and it won't let us help. Sir, sir, our avionics. Major, I don't want to fire my weapon in the cockpit any more than you want me to. We've got no choice. I will not be held hostage in my own goddamn plane. [Three gunshots echo] [Two gunshots echo] [Three gunshots echo] [Three gunshots echo] [Keypads beeping] [Sighs] My code isn't working. Breathe. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Breathe. Come on. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Sir... Breathe. Breathe. He's gone. [Sobbing] He's dead. How can you just let him die like that? Ma'am, I need you to sit in your seat. Simms: Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing heavy turbulence. Everybody, sit in your seats! Please take your seats and fasten your seat belts. Fasten your seat belts. Lindsay, that includes us. Let's go. Okay. Okay. Should we tell the pilot? No. Sterile cockpit rule is now in effect. Safety critical information only. All right, look, we gotta work quickly. Come on. Hey, what are we doing here? We gotta stop those planes from colliding. We have no beacons, no communications. Down here. [Machinery humming] We gotta get to that transponder. Okay. [Crackling] We gotta raise the antenna. Will this work? Well, it's all we have to work with. That way. That looks really bad. All right, you just stay here. Be careful. I'll be ready to go for help if you get into trouble. Damn it. Crap. Freeze! Hands in the air! This is a restricted area! Wait. You don't understand. Facedown, hands on the ground now. Hands where I can see them! Now! Hands behind your back. Command, this is private Clark at 29483. Suspect has been apprehended. Requesting transportation. Over. All personnel... Is he your C.O.? Be advised we are dealing with this falling satellite. I need to talk to your C.O. Ma'am, I need you to be quiet, please. [Radio] Figure something out. Please, my name is Dr. Antonia Pierce. I am the chief technical officer at jpl. I'm no--I'm not a bad guy. Please, I need to talk to your C.O. Ma'am. Listen, private. There are two planes on a collision course with each other, and one of them has the president on it, so you need to take me to your C.O. right now, or you're gonna have to explain to congress why you let a civilian airplane hit air force one. All right, let's go. [Steam hissing] [Radhika screams] Hey! Where are you?! [Gasps] Over here! Ohh ho! Please! Where are you?! Help me! I'm over here! Please help! Oh, please. Bob: I've never seen anything like this. Where are you going? To the bunker. [Grunting] Damn it. Nothing? Thing's not going anywhere. We've haven't had any identification tags on these radar targets at all. Cleveland control must have been knocked out by the storm. Yeah, and without any identification tags, acat is marking everything as a target. Including us. Sir. Attempting to contact air force one, colonel. Anything? B.a.c.n. Is down, so we're trying to go off network. Central command through national guard is feeding us intel, but... We might as well be using smoke signals right now, sir. What was the latest report? Eyeballs have stated that air force one is in lockdown mode. Any other birds around it will be deemed hostile. We need to assemble a crew for operation Sam fox. Sam fox? Yes, sir. But with what, sir? That. Are we completely blind? Tcas is nonfunctional. We have no warning system. Oh, shit. Visual scans in effect every 30 seconds. Aye. We need to clear the aisle. Gentlemen, would you mind helping? Yeah. All right, let's roll him to the right. On his side on 3. 1, 2... 3. 3. [All grunting] [Screams] Let's go. Over here. Lindsay: Try and get him in a seat. [Computer beeps] Oh, no. The acat has marked an unknown target. And if it continues on its current path and speed, that airplane will be within 100 meters of us in less than an hour, sir. Let's fix this thing so we won't be there when it happens, major. [Screaming] [Alarm blaring] What the heck? Status? Air craft addressing and reporting system is fried, too. We can't be sure what Cleveland knows about our situation. Can we get him to stand? Right. No, no, no, no, no. Slam--slammers are in the tube. Slammers are in the tube, and based on its size and speed, that unknown target is a civilian aircraft, sir. You telling me we're about to fire on a civilian plane? I'll go get some blankets to cover up. Sir, I need you to get back into your seat. Aah! Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to get back into your seat, please. You can't make me die up here. No, no, sir. No, no, no, sir! Get back to your-- no! [Yelling] Sir, this is not the time. Passenger: Take him out! Sir, stop! Sir, calm-- [Scattered yelling] Stay there! Get in your--ohh! Sir! He's crazy. Take him out! Passenger: Scales all over the body! Sir, calm down! Show me the Mark of the beast! Thank you. Let's get him back to his seat right now, okay? On three. Sir... Is there anything we could do to stop this? No, major, there isn't. Good. Thank you. [Applause] [Applause] You got 'em closed? Yeah. You sure? It's headed right toward 'em. Okay, I'm gonna meet you in the back, okay? Lindsay: Yeah. T-minus 10, 9... 5... 4... 2... [Screaming] What the hell was that? [Screaming] Oxygen warning light's on. Pressure equalizing. Don your mask. No loss of control. Bringing her down. Maintain visual scans. [Screaming] I have to warn the captain. I'm going out there. Captain. Captain Simms here. Cabin pressure's dropping fast. What's going on? Nigel's checking now, sir. Put your oxygen masks on! Oh, no, Lindsay! There's an unexploded missile! It's in cabin! I think he said there's a missile in the cabin. Sir! Sir! Aah! [Screaming] Captain, please respond. Better get people to settle down. Keep everyone calm. Damn it. Captain yeager. Command chief master sergeant ries. The angs are onboard. Sam fox is in action. We've never done it at this speed before. Yes, sir. Can you handle it? We're ready. Good luck, ries. Thank you, sir. [Screaming] Guys, please, I need your help! Grab the missile! We need to get it out of here! [Screaming] Okay, great! Now we need to close the hole! Start pulling baggage! [Passengers screaming] Passenger: No! Not that bag! It's got my pills in it! [Passengers screaming] [Screaming subsides] [Coughing] It's okay. Hey. He's okay. He's okay. We need to get you a new seat. Sir, please pass me the-- put this on. Lie back. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your assistance. Remain calm. Breathe deeply. Nigel! Nigel! Colonel, colonel, I don't know how or why, but that DC-9, it's still here. Must have missed it somehow. [Chuckles] Yeah, but it's still headed right for us. If we don't change our course, we're gonna collide with it in less than 30 minutes. Well, the acat has our course locked in. But that DC-9 is flying right at us. Why is it off its approved flight path? This used to be an-- an old military base. The army has some old communication equipment that they stowed away in a concrete bunker. If we can communicate, we can stop the collision. Come on. [Grunting] We need an acetylene torch to open this thing. It's welded shut. Do we have time to find one? No. Damn it. There's gotta be another way to save those planes. Gotta be. Status? Still disabling, sir. Something's coming up on us real fast. Looks like a c-130. C-130? Why? It's gotta be operation Sam fox. There's gotta be a way to prevent any more of our missiles from firing. Maybe i--i can cut the control panel, i--i think. Do it. [Alarm blaring] Acat didn't like that one bit. Let's hope it worked. There's gotta be a way to reduce our airspeed. Come on. Come on. [Whispering] Who's there? Major Roberts, is that you? Where's the president?! Last I checked, he was in his suite. I'm going to look now, sir. Sergeant! Proceed with caution. Mr. President. Joan, is that you? Yes, sir. Do you have milani with you? No, sir, I don't. Where is she? What's going on out there? The security doors are programmed to isolate a threat, sir. What threat? Did someone take milani? Oh, god, no. I don't know, sir. Agent Lee is locked in the security station. Agent Roberts is locked in the lavatory, sir. I was in the hallway when the doors deployed, sir. W-we'll find her. We'll find her. Uh, Joan, listen. I need status from the control cabin. Go and report back. And, Joan, find milani. Yes, sir. Where did our girl-- I mean, where could she have gone? No, no. She was sitting right-- agent Lee. The president and Mrs. Phillips are secure, sir. Milani is missing. I'm going forward to the control cabin. Keep me advised. Sir, that civilian plane is still headed right towards us. We can't execute Sam fox at this speed. Can you slow us down? Sir, the avionics are way too delicate. I cut any more of these wires, and I'm bringing us down. I've only got one round left. Identify yourself. Cabin crew chief, sir. Joan, the security door's malfunctioning. We've weakened it from the inside, but is there any way you can open it from out there? If I can guide it on this end, sir, it might work. You push. I'll pull. 1, 2... [Both grunt] Again, sir. 1, 2, 3! [Beeping] Joan, the acat's marking the cockpit door as being attacked, that there's a threat on the main deck. Crew chief, I think that means us and you. What status shall I report to the president, sir? We must override the acat. Sir, I gave the president the override codes. Go get the codes, Joan, and bring 'em back to me, okay? And for the president's ears only, operation Sam fox. Milani, where are you? [Sighs] Now we're getting somewhere. Joan. Milani. Joan, what happened? I got locked out. The new acat program has malfunctioned. Is my dad okay? Yes, they're fine. They're locked in the suite. Could I talk to them? No, not yet. We need to make sure there isn't an intruder. Where are the agents? Agent Lee is locked in the security station. Agent Roberts is locked in the lavatory. What are you gonna do? I need to get the override codes to colonel lawler. I gave them to your dad in a folder. Remember? Yeah. With his paperwork in the suite. Milani, I need you to sit tight. That's right. [Spoon clatters] We don't need these anymore. Look, we're too low. Aoki, what the hell's going on? Look, whatever that was that hit us, it compromised our fuel tanks. Great. Anything with an integrated circuit is completely burned up. What about landing? Landing gear appears to be nonoperational. Is there any good news? Well, at least we're still locked on to our beacon. The acat is detecting a hostile intruder on the main deck. After everything that thing's done today. It's gotta mean Joan, major. There's nobody else in the hallways. Yeah, and we don't have much time to change course. If she can't get us those codes, we are betting the president's life on operation Sam fox. Yeah, and it's never been done at this speed. It's impossible at this speed, major. We gotta abort the mission. Yeah, but how? I don't know. Sir! Sir, what are you doing? Colonel lawler... What, major?! Please. You will crash this plane. If I didn't think putting a bullet in this thing wouldn't take us all down with it... Colonel. Sir, please. There's gotta be another way. All right. We have to think. Yeah. All right. Yeah. We gotta think. We gotta think. Nigel. Nigel. He got sucked out of the plane. Where the hell were you? One of the passengers was hit by the missile. [Gasps] Could you grab a blanket? Thank you. Sir, would you mind helping move him? Let's get him in that... Chair right there. Yeah, keep his head covered. Thank you. Thank you. I really appreciate it. You can go back to your seat. Thank you. She was sitting right here when-- she can't have gone far. She wouldn't go off by herself, would she? No. No, she wouldn't. Um... My god. [Knocks on door] Sir. Mr. President. Yeah, Joan. Joan, is that you? I found milani. She's under the stairs. I told her to stay put. Rest assured there's no sign of an intruder. Colonel lawler believes the acat is malfunctioning. W-what? Malfunctioning? Yes, sir. He told me to tell you operation Sam fox. No. No, don't-- don't worry. Calm down... Is it that serious? And we'll get through this. All right. Uh, what's lawler's plan? He wants to try the executive override code, sir. Will it open these damn doors? We hope so, sir. Could you please pass the codes under the door, sir? Yeah. Yeah. Hold on a second. All right, uh, Joan, there are 5 copies of the override codes. I'm keeping one, okay? And, Joan, hurry. Just--just hurry. Understood, sir. I need the flight attendant. Ma'am. Ma'am, I need your help. Ma'am. I need my medication. Okay. Do you remember where it is? Yeah, it's in the red bag, but they took it. I have epilepsy. If I don't get my medication, I could die. Okay. We'll get it for you. I know where it is. Sir, could-- would you mind getting it for her? I'm having an aura. That means I don't have a lot of time. I need those pills. Okay, okay. We'll get them for you. What the hell is going on now? She needs her medication. It's in that red bag. Whoa. What do you think you're doing? She needs medication. Can't you see that? You're not touching that bag. I won't touch the patch. I'll just get the pills. It's too big a risk. She could die. Look, if you touch that bag and that hole reopens, it's a death sentence for everybody on this plane. Look, I don't want to die either, okay? I'll just get the pills nice and easy. That's what you say, but what if you're wrong and it blows? What then? You can't take that chance. I have a baby at home. What about him? Lindsay: Hurry. She's starting to convulse. She's sick. It's not worth it. Go sit down. We all deserve to live, not just the two of you. I said sit down. Hey! Get back! Put your hands on me. Come on! We gotta route them around that somehow. Look, I'm not giving up, but how are we supposed to contact them with no electronics? Maybe we could ping their receiver somehow. The DC-9 still has equipment from the seventies. There's only one place I know that still has that ancient equipment. Where's that? The aviation museum. Come on. My car is blocked. We gotta use yours. Gentlemen, people! It's getting so strong. I need something for her mouth. Oh, god. Oh, god. This is what you want. Don't you dare look away from her. Okay. Okay. She's gone. This is what you wanted. You still have to live with yourselves. Gentlemen, back to your seats. Here she comes. It's not gonna work at this speed. Boom attached. Lieutenant Montgomery, prepare for extraction. Operation Sam fox is coming. Now I want you to go. No. No, not without milani. It'll be easier for me to help milani if I don't have to worry about you getting hurt. Henry, I don't understand. I thought they said it was just a malfunction. All right, look. Operation Sam fox is here. That means we need to get off this plane. Mr. President, let's go. No, no, no. You're taking her first. Sir, my orders are to extract you first. I am your commander in chief, and I am giving you a direct order to take my wife first. Sir, my orders are to extract you and then your family. I am the president of the United States, and you will do what I tell you now. Yes, sir. Ma'am, I need you to step into the harness. Henry, I don't think I can go through with this. Kim, Kim, I need you to stay with me for milani, okay. Oh. Okay. Exactly how is this gonna work? We're going tandem. I'll be right here. Oh, god. Henry. Honey, I know you're scared... I'm really freaking out right now. But this is the safest way. You might get hurt if you stay here. Okay. Mr. President, the rope. What about milani? I will find milani. Don't worry, okay? Now, I know you can do this. We have to go. Henry, I don't think I can go through with this. Yes, you can, sweetheart. Henry, I can't do this! I will be with you all the time. I'm gonna need you to hold tight, sir. I love you, honey. Love you. Sir, the plane is changing course to avoid turbulence. We gotta move fast now. [Kim screaming] Something's wrong. They're falling away. Did the acat deploy weapons? Nah, it's a negative, sir. That's gotta be something else. Something's wrong. It's all wrong, man. [Screaming] It's too heavy. [Groaning] It's not gonna hold! [Screaming] Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. [Sobbing] [Hatch closes] He saved me. Ohh. [Sobbing] I'm getting reports that Sam fox has failed. At which point did it fail? Did the president make it on the plane? Details are unclear, sir. Keep trying. Yes, sir. Are you in charge? Not now. Yes, now! Private, this is not a holding facility. I made him take me to you! Private, get her out of my face. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. I can talk to the airplane. You can't talk to air force one right now, because you have no communications. But I can! I can do this. You have 30 seconds to tell me how. I need to make it to the top of that mountain, and I need to make it up there in less than five minutes. Whatever it takes, we've gotta land this plane. Yes, sir. Colonel, I have the codes. Thank god. I'll slide them under the door. Coming to you now, sir. Okay. They won't fit, sir. There's not enough space. [Beeping] Joan, the acat's marking you as a hostile intruder. It's got you in its crosshairs. Lawler: We gotta move fast. I'll read them to you, sir. Um... Step one, biometric identification, sir. Do you see the system, sir? Activating biometric station. All right. Once identity... [Electricity crackling] Is verified, you'll press-- Joan, something's wrong. The acat's--aah! The acat's trying to kill us, Joan! What? [Crackling] Sir! Colonel! Run! Run, Joan! Colonel, sir! [Yells] [Helicopter blades whirring] We've got 5 minutes to get this to work. This analog system is independent from the acat. What can I do to help? Well, we need a radio. Okay. First let's... Anything? Nothing. I need to boost the signal. Mr. President! Mr. President! Joan. Mr. President. What's the status in the control cabin? The acat has killed colonel lawler and major Lewis, sir. Agent Lee is trying to disable it now. W-wait a minute. Who will fly the plane? Joan, you have got to get us out of here. Once the acat is turned off, there will be no one flying this plane. Joan! Joan, can you hear me? Joan! Joan! Sergeant, are you there? [Laser blasts] Wait. Milani! Here. Try this. [Static buzzing] Okay. We got radio. Okay, now for radar. Hand me the batteries from the, uh, security lights. Here. Come on, baby. This has got to work. Come on, now. All right. [Pinging] [Laughs] We got radar. Okay. But we won't have radar tags. Well, we'll just get the altitude from the pilot manually. We'll do it the old way. Okay. Americana blue, this is Cleveland control. Please respond. [Static crackles] Americana blue 23, this is Cleveland control. Please respond. Damn it. Dad. [Gasps] No. Milani. Milani. Are you okay, honey? Dad, dad, the-- the lasers got Joan. All right, listen. Listen, milani. Listen very carefully. Can you get the override codes? Got it. Good girl. Good girl. Now listen, milani. The lasers are motion sensitive, so try to avoid them or--or distract them if you can. Distract them with what? Anything, sweetheart. Anything you can find. Dad, dad, they're coming. Once you turn off the acat, there will be no one there to fly the plane until I get there, so just stay calm and grab the stick, okay? Oh, be careful, milani. Maybe... [Laser blasts] [Beeping] [Laser blasts] [Laser blasts] [Solid tone sounding] Americana blue, flight 23... This is Cleveland control. Please respond. We've got 90 seconds until collision. God help us. Americana blue, this is Cleveland control. Americana blue... Wait a minute. There's something wrong with our beacon. We're going the wrong way. We don't have much power. You better figure out where we're going. America blue 23, mayday. Damn it. It's still burnt out. Listen, these old planes have analog systems. Maybe we can reach somebody in Detroit on that. America blue 23. Mayday. I repeat mayday. Requesting any assistance. Mayday, mayday. Americana blue 23, Cleveland control. Drop to flight level 21 immediately. Cleveland, we have no navigational control. Electronics are burned out. Over. Impact with air...One... 30 seconds. ...your engines now. Cleveland control, repeat. Impact with air force one in 30 seconds. Cut your engines now! Cutting all power. [Engines power down] [Screaming] We're going under. [Screaming] We're not gonna make it. Aah! [Screaming] They missed? They missed. Bob: Air force one, this is Cleveland control. Please respond. [Muttering] 6, 8... [Screaming] Hey, look. There's agricultural land just past the power plant. We can bring them down there. Is that gonna be enough space? Have to be. [Passengers screaming] Okay, we're in. We've got a signal. Now we just have to triangulate with Cleveland. Triangulating. All right. Aah! Kim: Joan! Ohh! Joan! Go. Go, Henry. Go. Americana blue, this is Cleveland control. Take heading 240. Prepare for a forced landing. You're heading for a field just past the power plant. There. [Screaming] Air force one, this is Cleveland control. Please respond. Milani! Daddy! Ohh! Come on. Come on. Okay. I'm okay. Hang on, honey. Better strap in, sweetheart. [Screaming] Over there. [Screaming] Alert emergency services to meet them at the crash site. Mercy hospital, come in. [Screaming] Air force one, this is Cleveland control. Please respond. Daddy. Okay. Trying to redeploy landing gear. Flaps down. This is it! Brace for impact. [Screaming] [Screaming subsides] You okay? Yeah. You? [Splashing] We gotta get the passengers out! Hey. Hey. I'll get the door. I'll deal with the passengers. We'll secure the slide at the bottom. [Passengers screaming] Lindsay: Everybody, remain calm. You ready? Go! Go! Go! Lindsay: One at a time. We gotta take the evacuation slide. [Passengers screaming] Lindsay: ...Time. One at a time. Remain calm [Screaming] One at a time. You take that spot. Come on. Come on. Come on. Jump! One at a time. Now! Go! Go! Baby, go! Go! Go! Go! Run. Go as fast as you can. Get away from the plane. Jump. You gotta jump. Come on. I'm the last one. The fuel. We gotta go. Run. Let's go. Go. Go! Go! Go! Simms: Come on. Come on! Go! Come on! Go! Go! Go! [Gasping] Mr. President? We're okay. We're okay. [Gasps] Oh, my god. Are you okay? I'm fine, mom. Air force one, this is Cleveland control. Please respond. Air force one, Cleveland control. Bring me in to Detroit. It's the president. This is Cleveland control. Air force one, heading 240, runway 18. So that's a Monday, huh? [Scoffs] Don't worry. It picks up later on in the week. [Chuckles] They're landing now. Whoa. God. Thank god we made it home safely. No. Not all of us. Let's get off of this damn plane. What now? Well, you go home, and you get some rest. A good controller is always rested. Okay. Hey, radhika. Thanks. You're gonna be a good controller. That means a lot, sir. Call me Bob. Okay, Bob. Well... We'll start Tuesday, pick up the pieces. I'll be there. [Sirens blaring] Want to grab a bite?
