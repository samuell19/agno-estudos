During the reign of Emperor Pu, that were called the era of prosperity and knowledge of the world, a man lived in Fun Giang Province His name was Hu Zhou and he was the greatest hunter. He achieved in his craft such heights he had no equal throughout the entire heavenly realm. He comprehended all the details and tricks of the business. Any animal or bird he could catch in snares and traps. Participated 5 times Hu Zhou in competitions the best hunters in the Under Heaven. And never lost. "PECULIARITIES OF THE NATIONAL HUNT IN WINTER" He won respect of all eminent fishermen of the Empire, without losing modesty character and ease of communication. He wrote 8 treatises on the art of catching animals and birds. Passed on my knowledge to many people but could not name anyone to be his student. It became boring, and so he decided to find worthy of himself in dexterity and skill in other lands. But nowhere, wherever he came, he could not meet the one who could compare to him in craftsmanship and knowledge. Until he reached the ends of the earth where the whole area was covered with snow, and the winter lasted almost a year. The inhabitants of this icy country hunted and caught fish in strange ways that shook Hu Jou's ideas and views on the art of hunting. He went into the cold forest and after a long wait managed to lure him into his snares just one little bird. Immediately there appeared people with strict faces and asked him for a license to capture birds and animals. Curious, but in vain you again going into the structure of the East. You'd better describe ours, domestic hunting. Well, we have no poetry, only prose, and vulgar by the way. You cannot find material, especially, nowadays even for a short story Oh, cut the nonsense! We are at the place! Hello, Kuzmich! - Hello! - Hello! - Receive guests! - Good evening! And who are you, exactly? Well, actually, I... Kurtsov Yuri Nikolaevich. Boss of the Main hunting supervision department Ministry of Forestry. - Actually, we are coming with an inspection - Oh so? - With an informal? - Naturally, with an informal. Welcome! - Got it. Shall I prepare sauna? - Of course! - Rechnikov Igor Valentinovich. - Semenov. - Assistant to Yuri Nikolaevich. - Very nice. - Well, how are you! - Yes! Fine! Well, are you bored there? Froze, poor thing! Well done! Home, home! Good doggy! How to call it? Whistle! Whistle?! Original name! Well, this is not a name! He is still young - did not earn a name. And you have to call it with a whistle! Igor, add the steam! - Kuzmich, do you remember him? - Whom? Well, this one, who arrived with an inspection. No, can you remember all of them? There are so many of them during the season. Sometimes it feels like you are living in a city! Oh, someone else has arrived! It seems to be the 13th cordon. Such air, ough! - Oh, mom! - Who is first? - I am the first! - It is not scary the first time! - Now, now, now! - Come on, I'm behind you! Here, Pyatakov, learn! Healthy lifestyle! With light steam, guys! We are to you. With an inspection from the Ministry. What? - Good evening! We are from the Ministry. We are from the Ministry of Ecology and Protection natural resources. I am Maslyuk, head of the sector, this is my assistant - Pyatakov Oleg. - Are you a ranger? - No, I'm not a ranger. I am the head of the department Ministry of Forestry. - Can't you see it? - Can not see. Are you naturists? Well, we are from the sauna! Wish to join us, colleagues? - Kuzmich's steam room is excellent! - Next time. I'm sorry, I didn't hear your name and patronymic! Maslyuk Olga Valerievna Maslyuk. Very nice. Yuri Nikolaevich. Sorry. Olga Valerievna, in my opinion, they are not naturists. For some reason we haven't seen them for a while. I hope they won't freeze to death after such a long break... Yes! This lifestyle change can negatively affect their health. Ough! What is it with you? Frozen? We are in trouble, Igor! Kuzmich, take it all away! Didn't understand! What for? There to you, Kuzmich, ecologists have arrived. So what? To me to the cordon a lot of people come. They have been on bad terms with our Ministry for a long time Well, now what to do? That's it! A complete, detailed inspection. How are the animals at your place? - They run there, in freedom. - Exactly, run. Unfed, probably, without human warmth, without care. Completely wild. - Well, what happened? - Ecologists have arrived, they tell you! Their boss is the woman. They told me about her. She used to be in the Ministry was doing land development That's it, guys, the rest is screwed! Yeah, but how does she herself look like? Not bad? Well, you can not lift such woman and cannot embrace Or maybe after the road and saunas relax a bit? I am an opponent, and I do not advise you. All our troubles and suffering here from this. How are you with nature here, ranger? It's okay, you could even say beautiful nature. Yes, nature is amazing! A lot of people come to visit us prosecutors, generals and all sorts of other ranks. And all, without exception, remain overjoyed because of the modest and unassuming our nature. And they destroy nature! Doing bonfires and trees are cut down. - Yes Yes Yes! - They shoot the animals. And then they are surprised: there are no animals. How else would you suggest checking how fat animals are? He, the beast, especially the wild one, doesn't allow himself in the hands just like this! so that we could check his fat layer, especially in winter. And this smoking you disturb the delicate balance in our nature. Tomorrow we'll start looking in detail. your possessions. Oh please! As you say. Now sleep! Get up early in the morning. - Where are your conveniences? - What conveniences? They are in the yard. As you get out - right behind the shed. Well, what did I tell you?! Now, without permission, you cannot even spit. Of course -- it violates the ecology! How are you, hearty? I am suffering. Don't worry. Now we will fix your health. And take the stress off. Have you got something to chew so that there would be no smell? So, jack ass, does it hurt? Now lie down here! Oh, Olga Valerievna! Oh you bastard! Such bastards walking around here! They roam boldly! Crawled into the toilet with me! Olga Valerievna, what happened? Are you okay? Ranger, what's going on here? One can't go to the toilet! Well, of course, there is no comfort. But exotic! Exotic? Is this what you call exotic, right? All sorts of people roam around, stalking! Who is this? This is what I would like to know Who is it! Wow! What did you hit him with? With a fist! In an impudent mug with a fist! So that he would never creep in and peek! - Kuzmich, how is he? - Breathes! He is quite calm. just curious! Yes. Did not get down in the den in time, so he is walking And before you, even people from The Attorney General's Office have been coming! He drank so much vodka with them! So he is suffering from a hangover! So because of that he was reaching towards you, For compassion, maybe. Who is this? Bear, seven years old. Not six yet. I have watched him since birth. Developed beyond his years and sociable. - What is it with you? - Olga Valerievna! Where are you going? Olga Valerievna, how are you? Drank! Well, what are you, Olga Valerievna! How could you at work! - What is wrong with him? - With whom? - With the bear. - Well, what will happen to him! He will sleep and will move on. I checked. You didn't hurt him. You just sent him to a deep knockout. Good, one came, without a wife and children. To drink -- it is to drown life in madness. - That's right, that's right, Olga Valerievna! - Exactly. Oh, don't fuss, Pyatakov. Who drinks -- he won't understand life. But she's right. Well, are we going to stay dry? Semyonov, pour! And why are you sitting on the edge? Well, I can't! I will suffer in the morning. Oh, don't worry about that. I have such air here and natural purity that you'll wake up like a baby. - Well, why are you like not our own? - Me then in a saucer. For conspiracy. Kuzmich is absolutely right. And don't worry about your head will not hurt. - Well, how? - Thank you, Olga Valerievna. Great! - Good morning! - Good morning! - That's it, now that's it! - We need to work. One minute, Yuri Nikolaevich. Please wait a little. I'm quick. Good morning everybody! I'm in Japan "rock garden", in Kyoto, visited. To be honest, I didn't understand. Either it was hot, or we at lunch drank warm sake. I fell asleep. Yuri Nikolaevich, it's free! Yuri Nikolaevich, it's free! Yuri Nikolaevich? Yuri Nikolaevich, why are they? Ah, nonsense. Mind and meditation you can't fix your head. Will not work! You, Igorek, find us pickle. Cabbage pickle is better. - Cabbage? - Uh-huh, cabbage is better. Ours! Follow, follow! The swamp is hot! - Kuzmich! - A? - Can you walk already? - I can! - Be careful, Olga Valerievna! - So why aren't you walking already? The swamp is hot! Here in the spring it sucked two tractors of geologists! You have to follow the trail. By bumps. Need to hurry up. I'm afraid that by night we won't return God. No one has a drink, huh? - Here. - Yeah. Thank you. Well, let's go? What's the point of wasting time?! What are you worth? Let's go! Follow me! - Kuzmich! Big field! - What are you talking about! Three Monaco will fit here! - What is growing here? - Sedge, lichen, moss! Swamp it! Ah, solid! Oh, judging by the tracks, the beast is there. Who walked here? The vole ran. And over there - weevil. And who is this weevil? Weevil is small local predator. Maybe we'll make a fire, warm up? A bonfire only destroys nature. Yes, warming up would be nice. Is there anything else to drink? What is this? - Tea. - Give! - It's not tea. - And what? - Cognac. - Can't be! Come on, it's getting dark soon. - Exactly! - Kuzmich! - A? Well, hold on a bit! Where? Where does this road lead, after all? - Well, there - to the military training ground. - Okay - And there - to my cordon. - Got it. Give a hand! 12 kilometers left. Ivan Susanin, we could come here by cars? Of course we could! But you yourself wanted to see my land. So I showed you my possessions. It is almost like two Luxemburgs with a tail I think we got through all 3. Didn't understand. And where...? Kuzmich, well, you... Original, great original! I would say - an exceptional original. - Didn't understand! - Well, what is here not to understand? What banana were you winding us through the swamps and snow? I erased all my legs, up to my ears! Are you all like this? Large? Originals? No, I didn't understand! There were four of you! Where is this little one? Pyatakov. Pyatakov! Where are you? Pyatakov, come to me! Oleg! - There are no traces of him yet! - Where are you? Pyatakov! Oleg! How we ended up with him, Yuri Nikolaevich! - Pyatakov! - Are there predators here? Eat. There, a couple of wolves have passed. But it was in the morning. Pyatakov! - It seems to be his footprint. - Oleg! - Oh, gone! - Pyatakov! Quiet, quiet! - Well, is he there? - He's sleeping. What's there? Pyatakov! Go to sleep! Snoring! Now I'll get you! - Well, what is he there, alive? - Alive, breathing! Oleg! Climb! Now I'll take you out! Pyatakov, come on, get out! You're always in trouble! I don't think he's alone there. - Trouble. - Get out. Get out instantly. - Who is he with? Well, is he there, Olga Valeryevna? There is a bear. Yuri Nikolaevich. - Oleg. Pyatakov. - Olga Valerievna. - Get out slowly. - Olga Valerievna! - Come on, get out! Faster! - Someone's holding my leg! - Don't kick your feet! Don't rage the beast! - Come on, come on! - Whom? - Jaeger! - Don't make him angry! - Help me! - Someone is holding my leg. - Oleg! Well I am saying don't hit the bear in the face! - Bear?! - Do not kick the bear in the face with your feet! - Well, drag, drag me! - Yuri Nikolaevich! Don't fall behind! - Where are you going? - Igor, don't run away alone! Get lost. Olga Valerievna, run after me! Why be afraid? - He's domesticated. - Don't piss off the beast! - Faster, Olga Valeryevna! - Save the bear! Do not hurt the animal! Take care of nature, Kuzmich! Stop! You'll freeze! Well, this one is lost. Good dog, beautiful. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Get out! Mikhalych, in my opinion, this is not a cordon Kuzmich. Cars, some strange dog. No, Kuzmich's cordon. I walked around here - "rock garden" is here Yes, with our uncertain Russian life anyone can build not only "rock garden", but also everything that comes up. I mean, wild fantasy people have. Especially away from cultural centers. In such a retreat and peace, everything whatever you can think of. My professional experience prompts: Kuzmich has 4 people visiting. And one of them is a woman. So we can go all together, Mikhalych. We can, but only without women. Oh, you've arrived. Hello Kuzmich! - Hello, Kuzmich! - Sauna, prepare a sauna! - What do you mean? - We have one frozen there. Or maybe all four. Oh, they need to be rubbed with snow! Wow, barely managed to drag! Especially her - heavy! Who is heavy? What are you? Shot someone, huh? Not really. The guests are mine. Barely collected them in the forest. Well, come on, come on! Help, help! Well, you don't need to rub the snow - will not help. Well, why not - it is the right way. They need hot water. Do you have the right container? Well, there is. Japanese bathtub, wooden. Furak is called. They sent it to me from Japan as a gift. In theory, everyone will fit If they are without complexes. There is one woman here. Well, we don't have time for complexes! Kuzmich, come on quickly, there's 1 more moved. - I'm going now! - Got warm. Can be taken out. Where is it? Aha! Hello? No, this is not Pyatakov. He can't speak now. Call in an hour by phone. Maybe he'll feel better. Aha! Bye! Hello, hello! What are you doing? What are you?! What are you?! Why are you spreading your hands? I'll show you! Me with naked men to keep in a tub?! This is not a tub, but a real Japanese furake! - This is furake. They sent me a gift from Japan. I do not care, where the tub is from, impudence! - Natural Japanese wood. - Yes, we would take them out! Who knew?! Oh sorry! Who knew that you will feel better earlier? He's already moving! I know what was moving in them! I woke up from that! - Me? With naked men? - Mikhalych! Set aside! You would have gone into the warmth, otherwise you can get cold. Who are you? I'm a lion! Olga Valerievna, you remind me one lady served in my division hand-to-hand combat instructor. Means... Yes, sorry, I'll call you later. Have you come for hunting? Yes, I got a couple of free days - decided to have a rest. Shoot innocent animals? Wow, such innocent! And who was running from an innocent bear through the woods, all night long? This is another matter! We protect nature and you rape her for your pleasure! - Yes Yes Yes! - Yes, we are hunting! It's a sport. Well, it is not necessary to shoot animals. We don't actually do this. - Yes. - The process is important to us. - That's it. - Introduction to the natural world. Here, you can see for yourself. Tomorrow we invite you to the wild boar. - To whom? - To a boar. Here the board migration trail passes. They go through my cordon to the neighbors. We'll go too! Can I go to watch the migration Olga Valerievna? Black Raven, what are you wiggling over my head? - Mikhalych, add some cold? - Yes! You can't wait for prey black crow, I'm not yours. You can't wait for prey black crow, I'm not yours. Stop! We've arrived! From here, let's get to the numbers! Sorry, I'll call you later. We've just arrived to the wild boar migration trail. Okay, I'll explain later. Put the car in the bushes. You can leave engine running he is not afraid of it. - Don't make extraneous noises! - Fine. Yes? I can not talk right now. I'm just in the room. Yeah, I don't know which one. Once I know, I'll call you later. Excuse me, Olga Valerievna. Leva, how are you? Quiet. Bye. - And where is Mikhalych? - There. - Where? - I'm here, Kuzmich! So how are our guests? Don't worry, I put them by the road. It's calm there. The boar does not walk. - Well, good luck to us! - Yeah! You got cold, environmentalists. Excuse me, Olga Valerievna. I have weak lungs. Should drink less! And don't climb in the snowdrifts to the bears! It's random. I don't understand myself How it happenned. Well, be quiet! Why shout - the boar is already on the way. - And where? - Still far. But his hearing is amazing. Yes, and he is not deprived of the scent Here is a special ointment - rub yourself. so as not to upset the animal. - It's getting dark. - Yes. How can you see them in the dark? How, how - eyes glow red. You don't have to wash your clothes only open body. He is not afraid of this smell. Rub with a special ointment. It beats the human spirit. But it is bad that you left the car so close That's ok, it's too late. You can scare it, understand? What kind of ointment? Smells of spruce! Fir! But the main component is their feces. - Whose? - Boars, of course. - Olga Valerievna, are you cold? - Of course no. Let's go to the car. From the cabin the road is visible too and it is warm. I feel, it is empty, no beast. We covered ourselves in shit in vain, Excuse me, Yuri Nikolaevich. In the cold, the ointment pulled the face. Skin itches. Some organic. Olga Valerievna, do you want? Pyatakov, look! Do you see it over there? The red lights? Kuzmich said that their eyes in the dark glow red. Said. Looks at us strangely as if winking. Squints. Watching us. What to do, Olga Valerievna? It's all just weird. We, two intelligent, normal man, we sit here covered with God knows what, in the car. Waiting for some bastard. Don't get angry in vain, we're on the hunt. Excuse me, Yuri Nikolaevich. Why did they start firing? The boar is on its way! The beast has gone! Who was shooting? Who scared the animal? Something wrong. The boar walked. Beautiful! Look, very compact. Exactly on the roof. Judging by the external signs, it is end to the car - Be careful! - Careful! - And who is there? - We! Who are we? Ecologists, right? - Yes! - Me and Pyatakov! - Are you safe? - Intact, only it is inconvenient to lie And what happened? What happened, what happened! The boar migrated. And don't get in his way he will squash you! Get us out of here quickly! - Will squash in flatbread! - Kuzmich, I'm afraid we won't dig it out until morning. - Who shot? - Who shot? We! We shot at the boar! What boar? You broke all windows in our car - Almost killed us! - Sorry! Olga Valerievna, Are you comfortable lying down? And how do you get them out of there? Come on, do something! - Yeah, they ended up there... - Get us out of here! Well, I, as Kuzmich said, was shooting between the eyes. They were glowing in the dark. What boar? We were smoking in the cabin! Damn shooter! What did you do, huh? Yes, we thought the boar was standing. - Was glowing with his eyes. - It's we were smoking! Well, who smokes while hunting? Well? - Well, quickly take it out! - Hey, what are you doing there? We are resting! Get us out of here faster! Yes, actually, what are you doing there? What, what - fell under the migration. Damn hunters! Now I know what is your hunt! Don't worry, save your strength! What are we going to do, Mikhalych? - Come on, take it to the right! Right! - Well done, fit in! Come on! Move! Go to the place! - Well, don't speed up, do not speed up! - I'm rotating with legs! More, more, Mikhalych, more! More more! Brake! Stop! - Leva, one moment! - Come on! Hurry up, it's cold! The whole body is numb! Thirteenth cordon. Kuzmich. Give the police. Sergeant Semyonov! Well, do something! Take me out faster! - Good! - We're like sprats in a jar! That's it, we got to the place! Now we will free you! Hurry, it's cold! The whole body is numb! We're choking on the stink! Break this car! Leva, be a little bit more careful with a jeep! This car is like my own! And maybe it can be still fixed? What do you think, Leva? You can, if only for a convertible. Lord, this is your hunt, right? All right, Mikhalych, got through to Semyonov. Soon special rescuerers will come Insolent, dirty, smelly creatures! I'm talking about boars, Comrade General! You have to shoot them! Bastards - in one word! Well let's be consistent Olga Valerievna. They are smart animals. They need to be protected. You yourself convinced us of this. I admit my mistake. Stop! - Great! - I wish you good health, Alexei Mikhailovich! - Hello, Semyonov! - Here, the best specialist, rescuer. Well, who needs help here? Only faster, otherwise I was plucked straight from the wedding. Well, we're stuck, you know. What about stuck in there? - Quiet! - Careful, we'he almost got deaf here! Oh, there are signs of life! - How many are there? - Two. We'll get them out. I extracted 7 people last year from "Zaporozhets". Gypsies. Were returning from some holiday, well, into the valley and rolled down. You won't believe the car was like... Well, no more than a barrel of diesel fuel. - Where are their heads? - Who? Well, who are in the car. Lenin will get them out. - Who? - Lenin. - What Lenin? - Our rescuer's surname is Lenin. Because of this, he doesn't like introducing himself Because of his last name. And he wants to marry to replace it. They took it to the sauna. They are there like two sticky dumplings lay. Semyonov, give us some and then we got cold, we can’t feel our legs. - Well! - Leave, leave. Well, for us! For the lifeguards! Kuzmich, what are you like not our own? Olga Valerievna, Well, how are you feeling? Do you have any wishes? Yes I do! Pour me some vodka! - What about me? - And to you as well. We are sitting well. Let's go hunt deer tomorrow. Won't you make a company? Do you have a deer license? - Quiet you! - Naturally, no. - What, is this stopping you? - Nothing can stop us. One special craftsman gave the horn. "Call of the female". Male to this roar, running like crazy. Kuzmich! Well I understand that you served in the Caucasus! And you? How do you know all this? It sings so well! To support the company! We're leaving now. - Volodya! You have a wedding! - I'm on the road. Don't worry. We'll save you. - Whom? - Everyone! Here you are. Well, do you feel better? More? - Good morning! - Good morning! Hello? I am busy right now! I'll call you later! When do we go for the deer? Let `s start? Maybe the males are gone? Come on, give it to me. I played the trumpet as a child. Quiet. Answers. Male. The voice is rough. He roars like crazy. Apparently he really wants it. Come on The flute worked. There! The male is leaving. What does he need?! Come on one more time. Or maybe it's not the call of the female, but at all vice versa - the call of the male? Well, we challenge the males to fight, and they afraid and leave. It won't leave us! Come on again! There! There! Forward! You, most importantly, drink more tea. It will quickly pull yesterday stuff out of you. - And Kuzmich's tea is excellent! - Right! Authentic Chinese flower tea. Which, by the way, is made from the most delicate inflorescences of the upper leaves of the tea bush. He was always appreciated in Russia. - Good morning. - Who drank? - Have a seat. - And what happened, Olga Valeryevna? - To the table. - There was a glass next to my bed. Good morning! - Who drank it? - Me. - Olga Valeryevna, would you like some tea? - Why? The glass had my contact lenses. Do you need help? Dont be upset. They will dissolve quickly in his stomach. Nothing special. Have a seat. - Wait, wait. - Come on. Oops. Very close. How boldly he responds, huh! I think he's challenging us to battle. Your horn is faulty! I have a very correct horn, if the beast itself responds to it. Now we will kill it. Come on! He is there. Forward! What are you trumpeting? Haven't met mine? - In dirty orange jackets! - No, we didn't! 4 hours ago they left for the store and still haven't returned! - Large male. - I already started to worry! Somehow hunting bored me Black Raven, what are you wiggling over my head? - Pyatakov! - Here! - Home! Sleep! - I'm coming! - Pyatakov, quickly home! - I'm going, Olga Valerievna! - Is she always like this with you? - How? Oh, I had a captain, a beast. All time was shouting something, demanding. I brought him to Kuzmich to hunt just for a couple of days, and that's it. - What "it"? Got better? - He left the police. He works as a ranger in the neighboring area. They say he's become a normal man. No, mine is not like that. It's not so easy to process her - Pyatakov, go home! - I'm coming! Well, I'm quickly. She will lie down - I will come to you. We sit well. Run, Olga Valeryevna! It is true that all our troubles come from them. Here you are wrong. Well, for the true women, and there are a lot of them, trust me, both here and all over the world! Well, for women! The whole year, or even more, Hu Jou spent among the inhabitants of the snow country. But he couldn't make sense of their skill in catching birds and beasts. He learned about the most revered hunter and came to him with a desire take on a skill to comprehend all the subtleties and features hunting of the locals. I want to be your student. "How much time should be spent on trainings, to reach your level? Hu Zhou asked the skilled hunter. At least seven years no more than eight. So long? Is there no more short cut? There is, but you will know only the outer side of the doctrine, but not its essence. Even if meditating in the yard day and night in the pose of "cherries" on the snowy rock then it could take 6 years. Meditation alone will not make you as a master but can restore peace spirit and body which is essential for any hunter. Yes. Pyatakov, where are you? Pyatakov! Oleg! Hey Pyatakov! Get up your lungs are weak. - What, it's time to hunt? - No hunting! We have enough of your desires. Anything but hunting. Here! There are good depths. Even carp can get there. Or someone else. Kuzmich! And who is that sitting there? on the tree? - Where? - Capercaillie. Oh, and there's another one nearby. And there is more. We didn't take guns! He said: at least one gun should always be with you. You won't take all of them anyway! They are sitting specially on the very top so that we wouldn't get close to them. If only you fly? Will you fly?! Semenov! I'm tired of fishing. Come with me, eh. Leva! Here's another found! Wow! Will do. Leva! Are you quite sure? It's a risky business! This method of hunting will become part of the future hunting textbooks! Or maybe they will write it in the annals. - For memory. - Come on. For history! Wait, not like that! Come on! Semenov, and since childhood I dreamed to conquer the air element. It's done! Well, with God! Go! Can't get them? How! From Soloveichik no one has left yet! For every trick there is a natural savvy! How are you, Leva? Oh, it lifts well! Bait more! More? I'm baiting! I say bait, but be careful! Leva, are you okay? Leva, how are you? We were born to make a fairy tale true... Semenov! - Are you measuring? - What? How many meters did you measure? 30 meters, got it? Did you count 30 meters? Lyova, speak louder! I can not hear you! I say: 30 meters, no more! - Understood? - What? I don't understand! - Semyonov! - What? You me you... Higher! Raise higher? Understood! What, bait more? I can not hear! - Raise it higher! - Lyova, I'm lowering! Idiot! I'll show you how to lower!! I say: lower, lower lower, idiot! Please! Hey help! God, what it is? Higher? Leva, how is it there? Beautiful? - Help! - Leva! What are you?! Lower! Leva! Leva! Cling to the trees! Do you hear? Pyatakov, is it biting [fish] at yours, Oleg? - A? - Is it biting? I don't know, Olga Valerievna. It seems not. Oh, where's the mug? Oh what is it? Someone got caught! Can not pull out, stuck! Kuzmich, help! This is a trout. Okay, big fish. Lucky. And how to pull it out, Kuzmich? Oh, doesn't come out! Oleg, wait, don't delay! Now I'm going to cut the hole. Aha! Olga Valerievna, look - got a big one! Take more around the edges! Big one caught! Now. Lyova! Lyova! Shoot the probe - it will let you! Do you hear? Lyova! If it's not enough, then shoot down the second one! Lyova, come on, I'm from the service I'll shoot! Me too, Voloshirovsky damn shooter! My God. God! How sick. Leo, don't be afraid! - Semyonov... Not you, probe. How scary! Catch! Then shoot yourself! Do not shoot! Ammos are left at the cordon! Help! It makes me sick! Lyova, I'm running to the cordon now for the ammo! Be patient! Do you hear? Be patient! Idiot! How is he will deliver here these cartridges? God. How can I bring them to you? You please be careful! Don't hit my fish. Why doesn't he resist? You are mad, are not you? No, big! Maybe just curious? It's interesting when such attention so many people give you. - All right! - Come on, be careful! For gills, for his gills grab gently! Hey where? - Cover it! - Cover it, cover it! - People... People... - What? I told you, you need to grab the gills or for the splash. - Where is my big fish? - There, there. Gone! I grabbed what was the closest slipped! Bastard! As if he was waiting, immediately rushed into the depths. I was almost carried away. I'm surprised by you. What were you doing there? See if there are many fish. Well, how much? Well, for salvation!
