Your pupil is on TV, Dad. Really? Did he contact you? We had tea and he walked me home. Ip Man was my Dad. Based on his scholarly appearance, Few people knew he was a martial arts expert. And Master to a world-famous action star. My parents were both raised by wealthy Foshan families. We wanted for nothing until the Japanese came and took everything we had. My two young sisters starved to death. Dad believed a man should see the world, and on this, he was true to his word. Despite a chronic stomach illness, he went alone to Hong Kong in 1949. Where is this place? Over there. Thank you. You're welcome. Coming. Who is it? I'm looking for Lee Man, my name is Ip. Master Ip. Lee's out but he told me to expect you. Come in. My name is Leung Sheung. They say you're famous in Foshan. Perhaps I can see for myself? You will, someday. Why not today? Please? Not on an empty stomach. Are you hungry? I'll be right back. I'm a martial artist myself, but I've never come across Wing Chun. I'd love to see it. I hear it was invented by a woman and that it's awesome. I'm ready... when you are, Master Ip. Let me clear the room... Don't bother. You win if you knock me off this newspaper. Are you all right? I'm fine. Please take me as your pupil, Master Ip. Let's talk after lunch. Try our local speciality, "meal-on-a-plate". Indeed, all-in-one. Fewer dishes to wash, too. No more four-course meals these days. That was a lifetime ago for me. The recent influx of immigrants made it hard to make a living. You can't get a job without a sponsor. But you must have good connections, so that shouldn't be a problem. You don't really need a job, just open a martial arts school. Not unless it's absolutely necessary. Don't you want to teach? Yes, but I don't want to run a school. Come this way... This is Master Ip. Hello, Master Ip. Master Ip is from Foshan. His Wing Chun is awesome. He'll give lessons on our rooftop from now on. Let's tidy up and make room. King. Sei-Mui. Give us a hand. This way, Master. Superior skills make for a strong personality, which makes it hard to get a sponsor and hence a job. But such is life. If Master had a cushy desk job, he may not have become the Grandmaster he is. If I weren't leading the Restaurant Workers' Union and a little bit of influence, he may not have taught on our rooftop, and I couldn't have introduced Wing Chun to others. Barbecued pork buns. Chan Sei-Mui is a dim sum girl. She's a huge fan of martial arts novels, and dreams of defending justice like her heroes. Tang Sing is a cop, who doesn't say much to anyone but Master, and keeps to himself. Lee King is the darling of her factory. She's tough, with a strong sense of justice, and speaks out for the workers. You should shovel hay instead. Wong Tung is a prison warden he's a quick learner. Master says he has a temper like a bull. Ng Chan is a tram driver and Wong Tung's best friend. People come from everywhere, But Master has three "unteachables". Half-wits, wise guys, and those who can't make ends meet have no business learning kung fu. I think what made him the Grandmaster was his no-nonsense approach. He's flexible and never rigid, so everyone learns quickly. Some are always itching for a fight. That move doesn't count. What are you doing? Hey... Enough bullshit. What do you want? Bullshit? What about you? You're a lousy player, spare me the crap. You wanna repeat that? You bet. This is chess and you're shit. You're asking for a beating. You don't scare me. They seem to know kung fu. This is Wing Chun. The hell it is. Screw you. Police? I want to report a brawl. Please hurry. I'm not finished with you. Come back... What about the damages? Hey. Take this. 50 cents? Hey... Come back, kid. Another mess. What do you want me to do? Play deaf, dumb, or blind? We learn from the same Master, turn a blind eye. Tang Sing, we're both civil servants. You don't scare me and you're not better than me. You put criminals behind bars, and I watch over them. So who's better? You, of course. But you trashed someone's shop. He called us, it's on the books. Tell me what to do. Figure it out. You're the cop. I taught you for a year and you go around picking fights. If I teach you for another year you'll either kill someone or someone will kill you. Kung fu is pointless if you can't use it. It's not about picking fights. Kung fu is about building your physical well-being. There are other ways to achieve that. Jogging, skipping rope, football, swimming... Then why don't you jog? Quit the backtalk. If I teach you to swim, you can swim far, or save a life, but never push others into the sea. Kung fu is not about picking fights. Only brutes use force, wise men use virtue. When practising kung fu, integrity is vital. Here's your punishment. Polish the wooden dummy. Master, everyone wants to do good. But in reality it's never up to us. Even if you can't fix it, at least try not to hurt others. I'm really confused. What's right and wrong? I can't tell any more. Follow your conscience, or go with the flow? You must choose carefully. Wing Sing. Man. Hong Kong's speciality, "meal-on-a-plate." Tofu, pork, beef and vegetables. Four courses... Let's eat. Something wrong? I wish Chun were here. I told you to bring him, but you wanted to check it out first. He just enrolled in a good Foshan school, I don't want to disrupt things. When he's here, I'll order an extra dish. A six-course meal. Let's eat. (NOVEMBER 12TH, 1950) I thought this blanket was warm enough. But this cold is a surprise. It's not big enough for us both. Take it. Your hands are cold. I'll give you some of my inner warmth. Who could it be at this hour? I'll get it, it's draughty out there. Master. What is it? We have something for Mrs Ip. You're very pretty, Mrs Ip. Master. Thank you. We'll let you get back to bed, good night. Good night. I thought you had a lot to tell me. I thought so too. I'm wrinkly. Don't look at me like that. I'm near-sighted. Can't see one wrinkle. Let me back up. How about now? The closer the better. You and me. Strike. When four unions staged a strike, other unions rallied in support. The conflict got worse for the workers. As union chief, I was caught in the middle. Meetings became highly confrontational. My foreman worked 3 years, 7 months and 10 days without taking one day off. It took the boss one minute to fire him. Most employers have no conscience. Calm down. Let's talk, okay? Our boss owes us two months' pay, and just sacked a pregnant colleague. Leung Sheung, you head our union. Will they stand up for us? I was fired for being pro-union. I have no job now. What will happen to me? How can I feed a family of six? You've done nothing. What, I should pull a knife on him? I know how you feel but we can't be reckless. Please calm down. How? Let's call a strike. Show the bosses we mean business. Then there'll be no way back. You're such a coward. No, he just wants to save his own ass. Your boss gave you pay-off money. That was for the New Year. Everybody got it. Be reasonable. But his envelope was bigger. What are you trying to say? How do you know I got more than others? It's obvious. Listen to me. A strike is effective. You read the newspapers. The bus drivers got what they wanted. But the head of the tram union was deported. So? Are you scared? Your move. Master? Whose side are you on? Everyone chipped in for the gift. Stop yelling. You'll cost us our jobs. You watch your mouth. Speak your mind, but don't yell at the ladies. Stop pointing. I've been more than reasonable. She started it. Just whose side are you on? Can't you see how much I've done for you? For me? My family hasn't eaten in three days. They're starving. And you, you're a turncoat... What? You wanna fight? Don't... Let's talk... Well? You want to? Let me. Sing, let go of him. Listen to me. If you don't stick together, how can you stand up for yourselves? Sing, are you mad at me? Hong Kong's no better than home. Maybe it's time to go back to Foshan. Stop. Don't let them work. Strike. We want a pay raise. Strike. We demand a pay raise. Strike. Pay raise. Pay raise. Strike. Break them up. Yes, sir. Are you okay, sir? Go, go. Let go of me. She's done this before. But this time... she beat up a foreigner. I'm Chinese and only a constable, I've done everything I could. I hope you'll understand. When was the last time you came to class? I've been really busy. Workers strike during the day, and have illegal meetings at night. I've got English lessons on Saturdays, and target practise on Sundays. Passing the review board, it's important to me. Turtle jelly, please. Sure. Master. Does Mrs Ip feel at home here? That's good. Did Lee King really beat up the foreigner? Not personally, but she was with the mob. No sugar? Next time I'll teach you "Sticking Hands." The gun you use is foreign, but your fists are your own. You can point your gun at anyone, but never use fists against your own kind. My treat. It helps clear your head. Sir. I want to release the girl Lee King. Lee King... Lee King? Are you serious? She hit my head. Sorry, sir. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Lee King, you may go. First you arrested me, now you let me go. I'm not sure I should thank you. Violence isn't the only option. I only know that you work for the running dogs. Running dogs? Is Tang Sing coming? I told him about Mrs Ip's farewell dinner. What did he say? He said... Never mind, he knows about it. You're setting a huge table. Master invited an old friend and his family. It was destiny... Have some tea, Mrs Lee. It's fate... - that we ran into each other. - Have some tea, Mr Lee. Thank you. You don't have to be so courteous, I'm no longer a boss. I've prepared your favourite rice wine. Let's have a toast. Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs Ip. My pleasure. Good girl. Times are different now. Everyone is having a hard time. It's good to see friends from home. Thank you for caring for us during the War. That was nothing. Let me toast you. Have some tea. Mrs Ip, When will you come back from Foshan? Not until Chun is on holiday. Chun is in college now. Congratulations. The chicken is ready... Let's dig in. Let's eat. The best behaved gets the drumstick. I bet it's you. Here's a drumstick for you. Say thank you. We don't want drumsticks. Save it for our baby brother. Very well. Speaking of which... Where is the baby, Mrs Lee? Mum... I didn't eat any drumsticks. Please don't sell us. Don't sell me, Mum. You still don't get it, do you? Baby brother wasn't sold because he ate drumsticks. Mum sold him to feed us. It wasn't my idea. It was your Dad's. I'm so sorry... Mrs Lee. Mum... I can't feed a family of eight. I had to sell one to feed the others. Shame on me. Shame on me. If a man can't even make ends meet, what good is kung fu to him? I can't even help my friend. Keep your papers safe. Sure. Take as much as you can, Chun needs them for school. You're not taking this? No, I'll do the buttons and pockets when I return. That was the last time I saw Mrs Ip. Because on New Year's Day in 1950 border restrictions were suddenly enforced and Mrs Ip wasn't allowed to return to Hong Kong. Master didn't seem to mind living alone. He carried on as usual, but I see him lost in thought sometimes. Barbecued pork buns. Radish cake. Barbecued pork buns. Coming... The latest issue. Put it away. I'm on duty. Want anything? Barbecued pork buns. Tea, please. Remember, do it slowly. Don't rush... get it? Yes. What are you staring at? Focus. Right. Brother Sing. Please look out for us. Take good care of Brother Sing for me. Hi, Brother Sing. It's warm in here, take off your cap. I'm fine. Cheers. Take it off. He's bald. He looks funny. Please give it back. I have to go. Are they supposed to be rude? Don't be upset, please come again. This is for you. Thank you, sir. It's said, no half-decent man would want to be a cop, some kind of thug in a uniform. And the foreigners stuck their noses in everything, except the Walled City, which is overrun with criminal activities. Not even the police wanted to deal with it. The citizens only go nearby for cheap dental work. And who calls the shots now? Have a seat over there, Master. A local tyrant. There's a gang boss in the Walled City known as Dragon. Legend has it that, on a stormy day, he came out of nowhere, stood in the courtyard, raised a flag and shouted three times. Since then, armed with an icepick and his powerful kicks, he challenged every gang in the City, and fought his way to the top. From now on, the Walled City is mine. He controls everything inside the Walled City. Does Dragon really exist? Of course. He's the local kingpin. We seldom see Tang Sing after his promotion. PC1759 Yes. But he'd send us money every now and then. Please give this to Master Ip. Yes, sir. Saying it's his tuition fee. The others chipped in financially, and took turns looking after Master. Master. Time for your medication. Be careful, it's hot. Yeung Siu-tong. In 1953, I lost the union election. Leung Sheung. Auyeung Chi-Ming is elected. It's their loss. Good luck to them. But Master could no longer teach on the rooftop. We all decided to chip in and rent a place so he could open a school. He refused at first. But we convinced him. He was adamant about not putting up a sign because... A sign means business. You can't buy kung fu like a bowl of rice. Let go of me. You can't hide from me, junkie. I'm only two days behind. Don't push me like that. You'll get nothing if I die. I won't let you die. - Now move it. - Let go. Stop it. How much does she owe you? $10, including interest. Take it and leave. Get lost. Thank you. I'll pay you back. Forget about it. Just kick the habit. I tried. I couldn't. ♪ They say life is like a dream ♪ ♪ But I say dreams reflect life ♪ A toast to the new school and more pupils who can fight like me. Stop boasting. Cheers. Do you have a wish, Master? I wish you'd stay out of trouble. He means you. Master. What is it? Never mind... it's nothing. Why can't you just say it? Master. Actually... I have an announcement. King and I are getting married. Good. Like me, you have an eye for a good wife. Congratulations. Cheers. King. Didn't I tell you? You'd get your man. Let's dance, Sei-Mui. Please join us, Master.

Bravo. Thank you. Hello. Jenny. You sing, I write. I can make you a star through my columns. No, thank you. Don't tell me you're not for sale. I'll share a drink with you. Yeah. Thank you. You sure can drink. One more toast, then. Very well. How dare you. Out of my way. Go to Hell. That's enough. Stupid old fart. It's burning... Help. It's burning... Sorry. You have a lot of nerve. You bet. That's Wing Chun. Are you all right, Miss? Thank you. May I know your name, sir? I'm just a nobody. You sang well. Thank you. Vamp. Master, we were attacked by the Wing Chun school. That's right. What the hell? We have no quarrel with you. Why did you beat up my pupils? Who are your pupils? Masters... That's him. He said our school is useless. He even verbally abused your parents. Fix him good. Shortly after 11 last night a peculiar street fight broke out on Temple Street in Yaumatei. Thank you. Feel free to browse. Newcomer Wing Chun took on the famous Pak Hok and fought for supremacy. Each school sent out its best fighters in a earth-shattering martial arts battle. Master of the Wing Chun school... They misspelt your name as Ip Mon. He jumped on rooftops and walked on walls, routed Pak Hok's twin-sword assault, and destroyed everything in sight. Pak Hok suffered heavy casualties. That's nuts. (PAK HOK KUNG FU ACADEMY) Master... They made us out to be a bunch of wimps. I read it. We gotta teach them a lesson. We don't always have to resort to violence. Diplomacy. I'll post my thoughts in the newspaper. "The falling leaves understand the world's worries," "while the cicadas are oblivious to departing sorrow." "If the spring breeze doesn't care for the rain on the eaves," "why should the setting sun care about staying or leaving?" What does it mean? It means Ip Man... It's Master Ip Man. Very well... this Ip Man shouldn't let his pupils loose when he can't even care for himself. That's complete nonsense. That's not what happened. "A wandering leaf" "is free to go anywhere." "Self-discipline always comes before fame." "There's no end to learning and practising kung fu." Master Ip means, even though he wanders, he has few worries. His concern is self-discipline before fame, and he's very sure of himself. What he doesn't understand is how powerful his opponent is. A scholar and a warrior. Hurry, it's almost showtime. Is Master Ip in? Who is it? He's inside. Ng Chung from the Pak Hok School. A small gift. I'll take care of Master Ng. In order of seniority, it's surely my duty. I must receive Master Ng personally. I was most impressed by the images in your poem. I truly admire yours, too and share your sentiment on one line in particular. Which is... There's no end to learning and practising kung fu. It makes me even more curious about Wing Chun. Shall we compare notes in private? With pleasure. Leave us be, now. Sei-Mui, let me take a peek. Where did they go? Come on... I almost broke your furniture, my apologies. Thanks for the oranges, Master Ng. Here they come. Master Ng. Master Ip. Keep it up. Bravo. (WING CHUN ACADEMY) Your patronage will be greatly appreciated. Bravo. You're not angry, Master? I am. (NG CHAN) How can he open a school? He's still a beginner. We can still use this mug. Did he have your blessing? Yes. Did he tell you his school would be across the street from yours? That, he did not. How can you tolerate this? Master Ip. Your jacket is rather unusual. There are neither buttons nor pockets. One slice is enough. Is it too sour? No, it's my stomach... Then you must avoid anything acidic. Sorry, I don't want to waste food. What can I do for you, Miss Jenny? I was looking for someone to address an envelope, when I thought I'd drop by to show gratitude. Address an envelope? I'm sending a photo to my aunt in San Francisco for match-making. The address... has to be in English. I'd pay someone to do it. I learned English in school here, perhaps I can help. That's great. Should the recipient's name be in Chinese? Yes, I think that should be okay. I hope you find your Mr Right. Thief. Stop the thief. Stop. Police. A cop. A cop is in here. A cop. A cop has come in. Police brutality. I work for Dragon. Shut up. Officer Tang. I've heard of you. What do you want? I hear you like to help people. I do what I can. I know you're up against Kam for Chief Inspector. You're well-informed. But... if Kam gets the job, he won't be much help to anyone. You're different. Is that a fact. You should work with someone who can help. I like helping people too. Chief Inspector Tang. I'm just a sergeant. This money... should be enough to get you there. You want me to become Chief Inspector. Yes. Because then, you can help... anyone you want. There's a lion dance contest in two days. Pak Hok's Ng Chung is favoured to win. But I think... the winner should be Chun Wai's Ngai Ba-tin. Do you think God will grant my wish? It doesn't smell. Ngai Tong? You're under arrest. - What have I done? - Shut up. Move it. Why? - Luk Fu. - Yes? Come with us. Two of our men have been arrested. Can we still compete? I won't buckle. - It's on. - Right. Sing is over there, Master. Why doesn't he come over and say hello? Let's sit down. Those lions are ganging up on Master Ng. Master. Come up. Hold on to me. Are you here to compete or to fight? Give them a hand. Yes. What should we do, sir? Let them fight. Escort the officials out. Please follow me. Let's go. Look out for needles on his sleeves. Master Ngai? Let's call it a day. I only take orders from... the one who defeats me. My apologies, Master Ngai. You've got a lot of nerve. Let's go. Our medicinal wine isn't bad. Infused with eagle claws and bear gall bladders. You can either drink it or apply it. What a way to make a living, drinking medicinal wine. It's tough running a school. People are fooled by our cheerful demeanour. But we're actually under great pressure. I'm sure you understand. My wife used to adore me. Because I knew kung fu, it made her feel safe. We got married, I opened the school, I was challenged every day. And then she felt unsafe. Now she wants anyone else, but not a kung fu instructor. Women are fickle, no? Master Ng, you have such literary talent, you could write and teach. You are far superior, Master Ip. I can't blame her, though. Young thugs are always at the door. Finally I found a solution. What solution? Between you and me, it's very simple. Whenever a challenger turned up, I tell him... I'm going to lock that door and here's the key. If you want to leave, you have to kill me for it. Or else... run now before I kill you. Nine out of ten ran right off. What about the tenth? The one with guts, I'd make my pupil. Right? It's hard for a pupil to find a good master. But for a master to find good pupils, it's even harder. I can't agree with you more. Have some tea. Cheers. You must be careful with what you eat. I cooked these myself. As good as a restaurant. A bit salty, though. I'll pay you for it. Please don't. I washed these already. If you like, I could cook for you again. Wake up. Time to go to work. Come on, get up. Get up... Your friend died in peace. I'm scared. Of what? Of being alone... when I die. Hello? Please hold. Master Ip. A call for you. Were you by Mum's side? Master Ip? Are you all right? In 1960, Hong Kong's economy was poor. Life in Foshan was considerably more stable. Mum passed away in July that year. I stayed with her until the very end. Nothing too serious. Mr Ip was in shock. Thank you, doctor. They sent Dad to Queen Mary Hospital. Perhaps he was overcome with grief. He didn't recognise anyone. Master. It's like he doesn't know us. Wing Sing. Do you recognise me? What are you doing here? You should be in San Francisco for your date. I found him already. Move over... ready. Smile, Master. Coming... There's my wife. Wong Tung and Sei-Mui got married in 1961. One more... Wong Tung quit his job after he got married. I don't know why. Then he decided to teach kung fu for a living. He asked Master for a signboard, and he inscribed one for him. (AUTHENTIC WING CHUN) Some thought Master was partial to Wong Tung. But he was the only one who dared to ask. If the others had asked, he would have done the same for them. Now that you've got a signboard, if you wish to turn someone away, you must have a good excuse. No wonder he refused to have a sign for his own school. It's not in his character to make excuses. He'd lay it on you straight. With a baby on the way and money so tight, Wong Tung took in whoever came along. Unfortunately, few went to him for lessons. Tung. Nice place. Interested in boxing in the Walled City? Chan won five bouts in a row, and made a ton of money. Sing. Hi, Sis. We're not interested. Very well. I'm off. Think it over. Very well. Bravo. Wong Tung won 10 bouts in a row. I'm very happy with the pool. I'll keep the money for Tung. I'd be even happier if Wing Chun loses for a change. Happier? Happier? Happier? Happier? Happier? Wing Chun doesn't lose so easily. What do you know? Master Ip who teaches kung fu upstairs? You're his son? After Mum died, Dad wanted me to join him. I finally came in 1961. Took me ages to walk to Shamshuipo where I found his school. Dad was a great wanderer. Every day we'd walk after breakfast. He'd take me to Central and Sheung Wan, where he'd point out different stores owned by his classmates from St. Stephen's College, among them, Tang Shiu-kin, the philanthropist. But he never called on any of them, he didn't want to ask for help. He never forced me to do things, learn Wing Chun, or help at his school. There's no difference, being his son or his pupil. I'm off job-hunting, Dad. Except I get to spend more time with him. Pardon me. I often saw a woman bringing him meals. I asked Dad how I should address her. He just said, "however." So I decided to call her Northern Lady. I liked that Dad was being looked after. Let's eat. Is it good? I finally got a job with a shipping company, working the night shift with room and board. But on occasion, I'd go back to Dad's for dinner. Happy New Year, everybody. Chun. Take a seat. Dinner will be served soon. How's work, Chun? It's all right. If it doesn't suit you, come back and help out. Hello. Happy new year. You can stir-fry this rice cake or make soup with it. I'll take that. Thank you. You should just ignore her. Dinner is ready. Thank you, Sheung. It's nothing. Master, your favourite shrimp. I have red packets for you. I put them in your drawer. Let me get them. To his health. No, we'll pass. It's lucky money from Master. I said no. Thank you, Master. Don't be like that. She's not Mrs Ip. Let's eat. Dig in, everyone. I have to go back to work, let's eat. Honey. Master. Can we take back the blanket we gave Mrs Ip? Why? Don't they want someone looking after you? Don't worry, I'll eat your rice cake. I'm more worried about you catching a cold. My pupils rented this place. I don't want to bother them any more. What's wrong? Is it your stomach? Let's go to the doctor, if not the hospital. They say this is good for pain. Try it. Better than hurting. Drink up. Don't ever give me that stuff again. But you were in pain. Never touch opium. Remember your friend? I just can't stand watching you suffer. Please forgive me. I'm not blaming you. Thanks. Honey, tell them to unload everything. All right. In the summer of 1962, Dad and I rented a flat in Mongkok. Northern Lady visited at first, then, for some reason, she stopped coming. That year, I started learning Wing Chun from Dad. The Government announced today... daily water supply is cut to four hours. Turn it off downstairs. What? Turn off the tap. Sure. Olives-in-flight. Up here... Dad took on more pupils back then. Some would even pick him up in fancy cars and drive him home after private lessons. Rumours went around that dad only taught for money. The winning lottery number is 03420877. 3420877 No. 3 typhoon signal is up. Typhoon Wanda is forecast to hit Hong Kong. A higher signal will be hoisted later. Citizens are advised to stay home and take precautions. Stay away from windows and open areas. But I'm never gonna throw a match. People come to see Wing Chun. Call it off for all I care. You're nobody without my arena. You think you're some kinda star? You'll do what I say. If I can make you, I can break you. Tung-tung, let's hang this up for dad... $100 on Wong Tung to win. - I bet $40. - Wong Tung. (IRON-FIST NGAI BA-TIN VS. WING CHUN'S WONG TUNG) King, babysit for me. Sei-Mui. The typhoon is coming. Where are you going? I've got a sweet deal for you. Let's make it more interesting. How interesting? 5 to 1 if you kill him. I'd love to make you happy, but it's not easy to kill this guy. Don't worry about that. Help is on the way. - Can I have your autograph? - Sure. Will you take me as your pupil? Yes. - And me, too. - Chan, give him the address. Very well. Have a soda pop for good luck. Thank you. Now I get it. Bravo. Nail him. Brother Tung. Let him have it... Sing. They've drugged Tung. Save him. Beat him up... Beat him up. Stop. Ignore him. Carry on. Stop the bout. Is this a boxing match, or a game of death? You drugged him, asshole. I call the shots here. The hell with you. I'm taking him with me. Finish the bout, and he can go with you. Carry on. Tung. Are you okay? Out of my way. I don't care if you're pregnant or not. Tung. Who are you? Why are they here? I am Ip Man. I've come for my pupil. Do you have Dragon's permission? Where is he? Inside. Thank you. They've drugged Tung. Brother Tung. Hang in there, Tung. Master has come to take us home. - Tung. - Master. - You're okay? - They've drugged him. Sing. Take him to the station. Anything can happen inside the ring. Don't blame us if your pupil isn't good enough. I won't interfere if the fight was fair, but this is murder. You have to answer for this. He made me lose money and you come looking for trouble. You'll have to pay for this. Sing. What are you waiting for? Arrest him. This is the Walled City, it's outside police jurisdiction. Hang in there, Tung. Master. Sing, If I take them out of the City, can you do your job? Yes. As soon as they set foot outside, my men will arrest them. Very well. Take Tung and Sei-Mui with you, and ask your men to wait outside. Do as I say. Go. Right. Give me a hand. Hold on. Sing. Get going. Go. Ip Man, you have no say on my turf. I'm not after your turf. I'm after you. We shall see. Stay alert. Run along. Take them away. Yes, sir. Master. Are you all right? One day in 1968, Dad asked if I had time to accompany him to visit the Northern Lady, who had lung cancer. We went to the Haven of Hope Hospital. It was quite a journey in those days. First by bus, then by ferry, and finally, a long walk. Dad said nothing throughout the trip. One slice is enough. It's my stomach. I'm sorry. I don't want to waste it. When did you find out that I didn't make those meals for you? I knew the first time you came. Bing Kee's dishes are known to be salty. Why didn't you say anything? Sometimes things are best left unsaid. I don't really understand... what the doctor said. Do you remember what I was most afraid of? I promise... you won't be alone. When the time came, Dad was with her the whole time. ♪ They say life is like a dream ♪ ♪ But I say dreams reflect life ♪ ♪ That is full of joy and excitement ♪ ♪ A short life ♪ ♪ Embraces sorrow and worries ♪ One of Dad's pupils went to the US. And when he came back he was already an international film star. Master. Long time no see. These are my pupils. Nice to meet you, Grandmaster. Okay, okay, be seated. Please. (RESERVED: MR. BRUCE LEE) I remember you don't like cold tea. I can manage. Master... American cigarettes. What's the big deal? Master. No thanks. I prefer to walk. Let me walk you home. Are you tired? Do you need a ride? I'd rather walk while I still can. They say you don't approve of me. Do you still consider me your pupil? Am I still your Master? - Of course... - I'm not saying... Wing Chun can never be changed. There's no progress without change. Master. I want to film you practising with the wooden dummy. Film? I want to introduce Wing Chun to the world. To the world? Good idea. After we're done with filming, I'll buy you a new apartment. I'll do it when the time is right. Then one day, Dad asked me to film him with the wooden dummy. He said... the footage is for posterity. Do you need a break? Wing Chun... belongs to everyone. "One's conduct should be modelled after a tree," "the trunk is rooted while its leaves flourish." "Whereas one's attitude should be like a coin," "square on the inside, while smooth on the edges." "Ip Man - The Wing Chun Grandmaster"
