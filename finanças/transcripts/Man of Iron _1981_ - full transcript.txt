MAN OF IRON Hope is with you when you believe the earth is not a dream but living flesh. That sight, touch, and hearing do not lie, that all things you have ever seen here are like a garden looked at from a gate. You cannot enter. But you're sure it's there. Could we but look more clearly and wisely we might discover somewhere in the garden a strange new flower and an unnamed star. Some people say we should not trust our eyes, that there is nothing, just a seeming, These are the ones who have no hope. They think that the moment we turn away, the world, behind our backs, ceases to exist, as if snatched up by the hands of thieves. - Are you happy with it? - l'll do it again. The censors will love it. - Maybe they won't notice. - Mi'rosz? They're busy with strikes now. Cities on the coast have stopped. Watch it or your show will stop. - Mr. Winkel, you're on next. - l'm always on time. It's four women this time. Get ready. You think they'll take it off the air? They won't spare you. I don't understand. We're out of time. What do you mean? It was great. Thanks. We're on in a moment. Let's go over everything to make it sound natural. As representatives of women's organizations you express your deep concern over unjustified work stoppages. - The nursery teacher goes first. - That's me. Talk about buses and drivers charging for rides. L've walked 20 kilometres. I don't understand transport workers. We have similar problems. My responsibility to children whose fathers are on strike... - You're changing the script. - Sorry. Whose fathers... Calm down. Read it. Have wilfully stopped working is to come to nursery school. Car drivers exploit that fact and charge a lot for rides. Swines. - Now about bananas. - That's me. Thanks for understanding. Ships are waiting in the roadstead and bananas are rotting. I know. lt's all about vitamins. Children are undernourished. - A phone call for you. - What? I want to add something. We, Polish women, appeal to you as wives and mothers: Get back to work. Thank you. It's urgent! - What's up? - You're wanted. - What do you mean? - Tell him. There was a call. The boss wants to see you. - Which one? - The big boss. Don't forget to pay your cafeteria tab. - You think it's bad news? - I don't know. Mundek, take over for me. I beg you. - Who called? - A car is waiting downstairs. - Who called? - The deputy chairman. - Jesus. - Better comb your hair. It's a dark blue Fiat 132. Good luck. Starring - Mr. Winkel? - Yes. I had a call. - Get in. - I had to walk out of the studio. Excuse me, do you know what this is about? No. SorFY- Throat problems. Director of photography Directed by Wait here. - Hello. - This is Mr. Winkel. - Get a drink and wait here. - No, thanks. My liver is acting up. Wait anyway. All characters in this film are fictional. Though they were set against real events in Poland, and authentic statements and documents were used, they should not be associated with any real persons who played a role in the 1980 breakthrough. Hello. - Is everything OK? - Gmm. This is for you. Look through it. Tape recorder. Money. Keep it safe. Sign here. Remember, this stays between you and me. Mr. Winkel? L'm here to pick you up. This way, please. Excuse me, do you know... - What? - Nothing. We're at the Gdarisk shipyard. It's August 20, 1980. This is Maciek Tomczyk, the man who started the strike. Mr. Tomczyk, please tell us how the strike began. The three of us came to work on the morning of August 14. Two guys and I. We agreed earlier that we would do it on the 14th. We had seven posters. And about 1,500 leaflets. I took 800 of them. I went to my section and put the poster against the window. I threw the leaflets around the changing room. I told the guys to come with us. The day before I asked them whether they would join us. They said they would if others did. I wanted to make sure. They wanted to because Anna was fired. There was a poster here saying that she was fired. Somebody tore it down. “Restore Anna Walentynowicz to herjob. A 1,000 zloty pay rise. An inflation allowance”. Those were our three demands. Later the rest of the crew came to work. I told them to go to section K-3, where the strike was to start. They weren't sure it started. I didn't know but I said it did. There were twenty or thirty people. We had to encourage another 170. We went to K-3 and the guys there had these boards on sticks ready. We pasted posters on them and headed for the management. People began to gather to see what was going on. The guys from K-3 followed in our footsteps. Somebody from the personnel office came up to ask what we were doing. We said we came to talk. A crowd gathered in front of the management office. We waited for Lech Wakgsa. We elected a strike committee. We were done by 10 or 11 a.m. The crowd kept getting bigger. More people were joining us. We marched together around the shipyard once again. And we headed back for the management office. Suddenly I saw Wakgsa jumping over the fence. He was not at work because he was fired. He came up to us and began to speak to the workers. None of us were good at making speeches. He said: "I worked here for ten years and I was fired. You all know me”. People listened. That's the guy who started the strike in the shipyard. His name is Maciek Tomczyk. A bastard. But his origin is quite interesting. - You want to watch it again? - No, thanks. His illegitimate father took part in a strike ten years ago. We are dealing with a beautiful counterrevolutionary tradition. Is that clear? Why are you giving it back? It's background material for your work. What? I don't understand. When events develop, we'll get Tomczyk. If a legend is born, we have to dispel it. We'll do it with the help of your story. L'm not a reporter. I wonder why they sent you. I wouldn't have thought of it. You know who got you out back in 1971? Not really. - It was me. See? - I didn't know. You don't know me, but I know you. Sign for the car, please. The strike committee banned the sale of alcohol. We have prohibition. But we'll manage. Here. - It'll come handy. - Thanks. They make bans. But two Poles can never agree while sober. Warsaw isn't aware that the situation is serious. They make foolish decisions. Here in Gdarisk there are no sensible people. Just wimps. They want to be on kissy-kissy terms with the strike committee. The basic rule is: We won't share power! You know what? lt's counterrevolution. We have to say it right out. We have to get into the shipyard and drive a wedge between them. What can I do? l'm just a guy with a tape recorder. You can do a lot. I know you. I count on you. We'll antagonize them and get them out into the streets. - You think... - I know! It's not a win or lose thing! Warsaw must understand it's time to take tough measures. If we don't take control, they will. Where will that leave us? What if we prove to Warsaw that it's a mortal threat? You have any ideas? We have to make Warsaw aware of the danger. Take the mob out into the streets, like ten years ago. - What if they don't go? - They will. What if somebody got rid of that Tomczyk guy? We'd have an explosion, a confrontation... Call an ambulance! ...and peace. It's nothing. The director has these attacks since he lost his job. I was afraid... You're pretty brave to come here now. I don't understand. Why? You saw yourself. lt's a hazard. You can get a rap from both sides. What do you mean? You dislike workers so much? Me? No. Look, it's going to get hot. Don't say I didn't warn you. After me, please. We have a reservation under the name of Winkel. Your ID, please. Room 1303. - Just in case, the tank is full. - In case of what? Tonight will be quiet. But tomorrow? Goodnight. SorFY- You got it right! It's room 1303 and your name is Winkel. Close the door. What are you staring at? SorFY- You know l'm from the police. l'm here to clean up shit. The authorities are no good uncle, as some comrades think. They played goody goody with the people, now they have it. Here's everything about Tomczyk and his supporters. Take it. A lot of information. Maciek Tomczyk. An alcoholic, hospitalized in a mental facility. Here's the diagnosis... It means heart and liver problems. Really? What the hell is this? Acts of hooliganism. He claims he's a worker. But his mother has a house in Zakopane and supports him. Assault on a police officer, trafficking foreign currency. Violation of social norms. He vandalized a day room in his boarding house. This is his wife. I know her. - Really? She's in jail now. - Maybe it's not her. It's her. She made that film about Birkut, a labour hero from the 1950s. - I didn't see it. - You will. Here's my phone number. I want a script for a TV story by Wednesday. We'll shoot the footage ourselves. lt'll take a couple of hours. Call me when you're ready. I suggest you interview her. Whom? Tomczyk's wife. It will give you an insight. You'll get a pass. Look through the files. Keep an eye on them. If anything happens, you'll be in trouble. Today you have to take sides. - Sign here. - Again? Sign, please. And here. This is your pass. Don't go inside the shipyard. We can't protect you there. Good bye. It would be a mistake to think that the strike in the shipyard and other plants in Gdarisk, Gdynia and Sopot was triggered by a small group representing anti-socialist forces. That its genesis and goals arose outside the working class, and are hostile to People's Poland. The strike had a wide impact, but workers have not exhibited any organized activities against People's authorities, our system or any of our allies. This assessment won't be affected by any speeches made by outside people representing dissident groups, which wanted to take advantage of the situation, but met with resistance on the part of workers. The number of work crews joining the strike was steadily increasing. Solidarity among workers was growing. In the opinion of local residents and party organizations, only dialogue can help overcome this impasse and make workers on strike resume their work. Of all our political measures, this may be the most important and the most effective. The regional executive committee has shared this opinion from the very beginning and will consistently carry it out. Good evening. Can I have a bottle of vodka? - We don't serve alcohol. - I understand. - L'll take it quietly to my room. - There's a ban. - I know. Who cares? - A ban is a ban. - Who made it? - The strike committee. This is a hotel, not a shipyard. You don't have to comply. That's for me to decide. So stop these stupid games. Operator. Good evening. I want to order a call to Warsaw. - You must be a newcomer. - I don't understand. We don't have connection with any city in the country. - The lines are blocked? - Yes. How about a telegram or telex? It may get through. Please call the reception and tell them l'm staying. Of course. Good night. Lets us pray for our government. Lets us pray for their wisdom in negotiations. Let us pray that they resolve problems for the good of the people. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... What have the trade unions done for us? I haven't been in a holiday resort for twelve years. L'm not entitled. Only office clerks go, workers stay home. A pair of tights for a 9 year old girl cost 90 zloty. How can we get by? Rent is 700, nursery school - 700. We don't earn that much. There are people who have a lot of money. I earn 1,000 zloty. I have to buy clothes and food. What do you think I can buy? Bread and margarine. We all have to eat, the government and workers. We're made the same way. The working class is not ignorant. lt's not the 18th century anymore. People have finished schools, they are educated. They think they can keep them in the dark? Why didn't they say they want dumb people in the shipyard? People know that trade unions in other countries fight for worker's rights. Here trade unions take workers for a troublemakers. We must have new people elected by workers. They will represent the standpoint of work crews. Do you think union officials will stand up to the director? They do exactly what he wants. Mieczys'raw Nagérski please come to gate 2. PROLETARIANS OF ALL ENTERPRISES UNITE! You know whom we want to commemorate with this cross. You know what happened here in December 1970. Let us say the “Eternal Rest” for those killed in that massacre. In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Eternal rest grant unto them, 0 Lord. And let perpetual light shine upon them. Amen... - Do you remember me? - No, sorry. You helped me ten years ago to get a job in the radio station. - Dzidek! - That's right. Don't pick that up! Don't read it! He can't handle it. He's a bundle of nerves. - Who? - Maciek Tomczyk. - That's Tomczyk? - Yes. We don't need lies thrown from the air! - You know him? - We went to college together. - VVhen? - Let's talk about it over coffee. - You still work at the station? - Sort of. Don't pick that up! I haven't heard you on air. L'm a technician at the local TV station. - How is it? - Quiet. What about you? - I make radio pieces in Warsaw. - As good as in 1970? Those times are over. I don't listen to the radio. My eardrums can't take it. How about coffee and cognac? - Now? - Yes. LONG LIVE FREE TRADE UNIONS JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FOR ALL PEOPLE. LONG LIVE THE STRIKE COMMITTEE. WE ARE WITH THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE ARE WITH US. MAY GOD PROTECT US. You want to see something? To bring back those times. DECISION OF DECEMBER 15, 1970 ON INTRODUCING A CURFEW IN GDANSK, GDYNIA AND SOPOT OCUPATIONAL STRIKE WE DEMAND FREEDOM OF SPEECH WE'LL BE ON STRIKE UNTIL WE WIN HANDS OFF THE SHIPYARD! NO KILLING. WE WANT LOWER PRICES DOWN WITH MOLDY GOVERNMENT ELITE SHIPYARD WORKERS! BE CALM AND PRUDENT SHIPYARD WORKERS! UNITED WE STAND WE SUPPORT YOU This should be shown to workers over and over again. To crush their illusions. They can either kill them now or recognize their demands. You think the authorities will go for the latter? Free trade unions, the right to strike? What about the party's cradle-to grave monopoly? And alcohol monopoly? - Sorry. Want a shot? - You bet. Help yourself. lt's the last bottle in town. The shipyard banned the sale of alcohol. So you can't buy it. Bottoms up. Cheers. It's too warm. You were in the same year with Tomczyk? No. We shared a room in the boarding house. Before we went to evening school together. He was difficult. - Unfriendly? - Friendly but introvert. Especially since the student strikes in 1968. He experienced that? On his own ass like the rest of us. I was black and blue from police truncheons for a month. Another shot? It is too warm. Vvhathappened? It was about his father. He worked in the shipyard. Illegitimate father. I know. His father is Birkut, he is Tomczyk. His father used to be loud, then he became quiet. Just the opposite of Maciek. They didn't get along. Because he was illegitimate? Come on, it's the 20th century. It wasn't that. In 1968 we were disappointed that the workers didn't join us. Maciek begged his father to encourage shipyard workers. But he remained unmoved like a rock. He said it was a provocation. Dad! It started! Close the door. It started! Do you hear? If it starts, l'll be the first to tell you. - The whole country... - Mr. Birkut, all colleges... Dad! Get the shipyard workers to support us! - All colleges... - I know. It's havoc. We're going back to school now. Maciek is not going anywhere. You can do as you please. He's staying here. ' B' Dad! 9 quiet! The police are trying to disperse us with truncheons. And they will. Let me out! Dzidek, show him your back! I had a bruised back once. Not bruised enough! - Did you learn a lesson? - Yes. To sit and do nothing? Open up! Calm down. We're trying to do something. They want to make changes at the top. To replace some people with others. They're using you and you're following blindly. You're calling it a provocation to wash your hands of it. Open up! Maybe you're right. But if we get the shipyard workers out into the streets... Come on. Save your breath! The secret police let you start, and they'll finish it. Stay away from the workers. - The won't go? - They will. When the time is right. Dad! You know when? A lie cannot live for long. Don't let yourselves be drawn into their game. It's not a game. lt's our life! How do you know it's not the right time? How can you be sure? You're scared. Admit it. You don't give a shit about Poland! You're to blame for everything. - People like you! - Stop it! Calm down! When it really starts, we'll go together. Not now. We'll never go together! l'm done with you! Two years later, when shipyard workers went out into the streets, we said: “Go by yourselves”. They walked by our boarding house and urged us to join them. This time we were unmoved. Students! Come and join us. Your friends are still in jail after the March 1968 events. You have a chance to free them. We can do it together. March 1968 will never happen again if you join us. The success of our demonstration is in our hands. Enough of oppression, violence and lies! Enough of suffering! Today we're coming together to fight for human rights. Students! l'm talking to you! Will you come with us? We were all going crazy, especially Maciek. But we didn'tjoin them. I know you didn't. Maybe it was for the better. I couldn't get over it for a long time. You still remember it. So we just sat there. The streets resounded with shots. Things were getting worse. And then... Maciek, get up! They killed your father! Where is he? He's lying out there. - Couldn't you...? - No. There are tanks. - We have to take him. - We won't get through. Show us where it happened. Wait. Your scarf. lt's cold outside. The crowd is carrying a body. People are shouting: “Murderers!” They have a blood-stained white and red flag. The group parrying the body has reached Swietojariska Street. Young people are walking in front. Probably students. They're heading for the townhall. They're carrying the body from Gdynia Shipyard station. There's a second smaller group with a stained flag. It has an inscription: “The blood of our children". What about the group with the body? It has reached the townhall. We have to get that body. lt's making an impact. Tell our people to get that body. A crowd is gathering near the city hospital. It should be dispersed. The body is lying on the sidewalk near the townhall. - Our people are there. - Roger. GDYNIA SHIPYARD STATION Where is he? They took him. - What do you mean? - He's not there. - Where was he lying? - Near the curb. - On the right or left? - Near the curb. - Where exactly? - On the right. Near that pole? - It wasn't under the bridge? - No. - Maciek! - Wait! - He's not there! - Let me go! You can't go there. They'll shoot you. I have to get him. Maybe he's lying there. He's not there. We'll find him later. How do you know? And now Edward Gierek, the newly-elected First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, will make an address. Comrades and citizens! My fellow countrymen! Today the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party has entrusted me with the duties of First Secretary. I address you in the name of the party. I urgently appeal to Polish workers, to all working people. Let us jointly draw conclusions from these painful experiences. I especially appeal to you - metalworkers, miners, Steelworkers... No. Enough. No more! No! l've had enough! The coast cities of Gdarisk, Gdynia, Szczecin and Elblag witnessed workers' unrest. - He got the right idea. - l'm not buying it. - It may be our only chance! - Lay off! Are you OK? Our friend had an attack, the ambulance took him. Can he be discharged today? We could have discharged him... Thank you, nurse. Just leave it. We could have discharged him the day after he was admitted. But he was in shock. If you think it's safer this way, l'll say so. Thank you. I live in the same country as you. l'm not deaf or blind. You think he's out of danger? That depends on what you write in his certificate. We don't give certificates, just medical information cards. - I have his card here. - What's the diagnosis? - Here. - Can you translate it into Polish? What for? I think we kept him long enough. Excuse me, does it mean he's really sick? From a psychiatric point of view, there's nothing wrong with him. He's no different that 30 million other Polish citizens. He has heart and liver problems. He must take care. I don't know if he can. His problems will get worse. - Anything else? - No. Excuse me, why are you doing this? Forget it. L'm not going back to college. - What are you going to do? - l'll go to the shipyard. - And? - Nothing. - L'll work there. - What's the point? What's the point of studying? If I get to be an engineer, it'll only be worse. Rubbish. Why? L'll have more to lose. I get it. You want to mortify yourself. - I want to be free. - What for? So I can make a choice. I want to understand what my father said to me. What he did. What an exalted idea. You'll ruin your life. Maybe. - Can I ask you a favour? - Whatever you want. Lay off. Did you lay off? Do you have any cigarettes? I got these Moroccan ones from a guy. - Can you smoke in here? - Not really. As for Maciek, he disappeared. Never came to get his stuff. Where did he go? I don't know. He didn't even Contact me. I ran into him in the street. - Maciek! What's up? - I work in the shipyard. - Here? - Yes. - For long? - Not very. I was in the army. All of us graduated. - Really? Last year? - Just recently. I can't find a job. Remember Kryska? That incident with the TV? They put you in a straitjacket. - You guys really fixed me. - Come on. I wrote a telegram to the First Secretary with congratulations. Really? L'll read it to you. Look... “Congratulations and best wishes for success in your responsible work as First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party from a young engineer”. Great. What are you doing? Wear it here. Bye. Weirdo. - He never graduated? - No. He got a job in the shipyard, later he became foreman. - Then they kicked him out. - For his father's sins? I don't think so. A different name, a different shipyard. We lost touch. Why do you keep asking? It's the first time I saw him. Nothing fits. - L'll try to put it together. - What for? I wrote about his father in 1970. Maybe l'll write about him. Hello? l'll be right there. - Sorry. - lt's all right. lt's late. We won't let you in. The radio and TV are lying. Hey! I don't answer for the Radio and TV Committee! I answer for myself! We'll let you in when you tell the truth about the strike. Mr. Tomczyk can't come out. l'm sorry. - Did you tell him l'm here? - Of course. L'm here for the third time. They're deliberating day and night. - Let me in, please. - I can't. Really. - L'm his mother. - We don't let family in. I have a right as a mother. Look at all the mothers here. Who's waiting for Mr. Piwiriski? Please come up to the gate. You never saw him ever since? You didn't help him? He sent all my letters back. He wouldn't take my money. He didn't want anything from me. So I stopped writing. Anybody would. I told myself I no longer had a son. I see he's just like his father. All I want is for him to live. They'll kill him. Just like his father. They'll kill him! You said it was the eight day of strike and you're not tired. Can I have a word with you? We're issuing this statement in the name of all journalists. You want me to sign it? l'd like to read it first. Let me read it to you. “We, Polish journalists, present in Gdarisk, declare that a lot of information and commentaries about the strike do not correspond to real events taking place here. This causes disinformation. The communications blockade and distortion of real facts are harmful and make it impossible for us to do ourjob well”. People think we're a bunch of bastards and liars. Will you sign it? Here. - It's a bit vague. - Why? Is signing things a new trend or what? No, thanks. I understand you may have your reasons. Wait. You got me wrong. l'm just in a hurry. - I see many people signed it. - l'm hoping for more. Ijust like to know what l'm getting into. One more. The public opinion accepted it very well. Why is that? In the report of the regional party committee we presented our joint standpoint. It was possible owing to our long-term, natural and direct contacts with the working people of the Gdarisk region. We tried to present the objective truth and to understand the reasons for the genuine workers' protest. A similar conflict in Gdarisk in 1970 had a tragic end. Is there a chance that this time it will be different? I am deeply convinced of it. All of us see that chance and we're trying to address all problems as fast as possible. I can't imagine that a situation like that could happen again. The costs were too high. Our country cannot afford to resolve conflicts between the authorities and the workers by any other method than agreement and dialogue - by political means. See? There's hope. - Sure. Who's that? - Our regional secretary. - Fiszbach. I didn't recognize him. - They're going to negotiate. Come on. They talked before. We'll have bloodshed. That would mean civil war. With the means they have? An hour and it's over. The shipyard is not alone. People will get tired. And then... You were looking for me? I have something for you. Provide access to the media for representatives of all religions. 4. Reinstate all people fired after the strikes in 1970 and 1976, and students expelled for their political beliefs. 5. Publish information about the foundation of the lnterfactory Strike Committee and its demands. 6. Take steps to solve the crisis by: a/ providing full information about the social and economic situation. B/ allowing all groups to participate in the debate about reforms. 7. Pay workers for the duration of the strike as for a holiday period. I have no time for you now, your mom hasn't seen you for long. Wait a little longer, grow up, we'll tell you what happened then. About those days bursting with hope, filled with talk and heated debate. About those sleepless nights we had when our hearts were beating fast. About those people who realized they are finally living at home. They are fighting together for today, for a tomorrow that will come. So don't be sad and patiently wait until we take you in our arms... The projector is jamming up. - What's going on? - The tape broke. Can you handle it? Yes. Don't tell anybody what you saw. I don't want to be fired. How long will it go on? A new government delegation has arrived. - Jagielski will outtalk them. - l'm not sure. 400 factories are supporting them. That's real strength. Elblag, Szczecin, S'rupsk, Ustka... You sound like they were paying you. Stop kidding. What if my boss hears it? - Which way? - Straight. - Will that grandma... - Mrs. Hulewicz. She agreed to talk to you. She's seen a lot. Like everybody else here. So what? Every full-blooded journalist... l'm not full-blooded, l'm a mongrel. I have nothing to say anyway. lt's up to my boss and his bosses. - They make the show. - Not by themselves. Stop this morality talk. Her daughter is right in the eye of the cyclone, so to say. Maybe we'd better turn back. - Lefi? - Yes. I don't like natural disasters. She can get you a pass. To the shipyard? In 1970 you wouldn't find me at home. If I didn't have problems with my legs, l'd be in the shipyard with my daughter and others. - You want to write about Maciek? - I wrote about Birkut. You wrote about his father? Agnieszka wanted to make a film about him. What does he care now? He's dead. He was killed while leading a protest march? No. l'll tell you all about it. I was there. I was on my way to work at the Gdynia Shipyard station. I saw him when suddenly shots were fired. People hid for cover. But he kept on walking. I called out to him: “Mateusz!” He didn't even turn his head. So I called out again. The shots were getting closer. The way he walked it seemed like he wanted to get shot. Like he was looking for death. This is something I didn't even tell my daughter. Did I do the right thing? - Here. - Thank you. It's too much. I want to tell you one more thing. Write it down so people remember. They shouldn't forget how those corpses were treated. A dead person is sacred. There were so many of them. I was looking for Mateusz. All I could see were feet sticking out with tags attached to the toes. I recognized him. He had a smashed toe after a beam fell on it. It's him! We forgot his shoes. What are you doing? Careful. Remember, not a word to anybody. L'll never forget it. He was honest and kind and they treated him like a dog! Write it down. Let people remember. They patted the grave and told us to get out. Other people were waiting. They told us to keep mum! I can't take it anymore! How much can one suffer? It's not here. - Here? - Over there. - God. - It was here, wasn't it? It was here a month ago. Jézefa Jasiriska, age 67. What is this? - Is this where we buried him? - Yes. His grave was here! What is this? Where's the cemetery caretaker? Over there. His grave was here! Calm down! The shipyard workers made a nice iron cross. Maciek placed it on the bridge where his father was killed. Maciek said: “Grandma, they came to power through the misery of those people. They don't want to leave a trace”. And what about Gierek? I trusted him. He seemed so composed. A sturdy man. And what? Does he know what he's doing? Stop daydreaming! Get to work! They'll be back from the shipyard. We have to get dinner ready. My daughter and his friends said that people had to unite. Free trade unions were founded in the shipyard. My daughter joined them and urged him to do the same. He didn't want to. He was bitter. When he tried to rally them in June, they wouldn't listen. I told the guys to stay after work in the changing room. Will your crew join us? We have to do something. How about a solidarity strike? Wait. Maybe the press will write the truth. How can we harm them? If we don't stand up for them, we'll get a beating next. Since 1970 the whole country has been looking at us. Only we can stand up for them. Who else? Gierek made promises to us. He has to account for his words. - We can only do harm. - Come on. Things are happening in Radom. If we don't do anything, it'll look like we're scared. They've rolled out their propaganda machine. Was our sacrifice for nothing? They're singing their old song. We have a right to make demands, to speak out. It's our responsibility. We can only do harm. If we join them, we can have another tragedy. They withdrew the price hikes. So? You want others to suffer and you'll do nothing? We've done our part. L've been around for a while. Mutiny means trouble. You make people think they can change anything. And their families pay the price. Nothing can be changed! Nothing! My father didn't die for nothing. We can't let others be beaten! - You know what I want? - What? I want my kids not to be orphans. I want to live and work. You mean slave away. Whatever. But I want to live as long as I can. Mutiny won't change a thing. You know why? Because we never united. When students protested, workers didn't join them. When workers protested, students held back. When Gdarisk moved, the rest of the country sat still. Now Ursus and Radom moved, but Gdarisk is scared. We'll lose every time. Stop insulting us. We're not scared. People know their own mind. We won't be provoked. Hey! Let's wait. They withdrew the price hikes. That's not what trade unions are for. What are they for? To be a claque for the party? Are you a holiday fund or what? You should protect the interests of workers! - Workers, not hooligans. - What hooligans? Remember what they wrote about us in December 1970? Weren't you on strike? Price hikes affected all of us. This is our last chance. If you don't stand up for workers, somebody else will do it. Who? I don't know. lt's your last chance to save your face. Then you can disband. - You won't disband us. - We'll see. Don't be childish. If you get into trouble, I won't protect you. What trouble? Who elected you and why? Protect me from what? From getting fired. They wanted to fire you. L'm warning you. Is it money or your function that numbs your mind? Fire me for what? I do myjob. Do I drink or steal? They gave me an award. Now they want to fire me? Don't talk to me like that. You know it's not important if you do yourjob or not. What is important? Don't stir trouble, sit tight. Do I have to spell it out? Don't get so upset. If they want to fire me, you'll protest against it. Nobody is going to stick his neck out for a troublemaker. You won't support us over Radom and Ursus? We'll call a rally to condemn you, if you try to do anything. Wait. What's going on? Maciek... lt's awful what they've done to you. I had to take a tranquilizer to give you the pink slip. - L'm so sorry. - Why are you doing this? If I refuse, they'll fire me. Then somebody else will give you the pink slip anyway. If that somebody else refuses, then maybe... - They won't fire everybody. - I have your pay. Please sign. Thank you. Count it. Good bye. - Are you done? - Yes. Agnieszka will tell you the rest. When they let her out. She's in jail now together with the supporters. You asked me what I think about all this. We have to win. If not now, then next time. We'll win. L've been reading a lot. Agnieszka, Maciek and my daughter gave me books about Polish history. A lot of good things are written in them. There must be justice. It's secured by the constitution and other laws. At least that kind ofjustice. Well? Will you write the truth about Maciek? Has he won already? Don't be cynical. Why don't you stay till the end? What end? - You'll write a great story. - And print it underground? You know more than reporters from Paris Match or Der Spiegel. You have exclusive information. Use it. I haven't even been inside the shipyard. - You'll get inside. - How? Over the fence? You'll get a pass. - Mr. Winkel? - Yes. Come in. My mother told me about you. The committee is not unanimous about this. Why? Many people think that you shouldn't get a pass. You represent an institution that lies exceptionally well. What do you think? I think you should go inside. Thank you. Somebody once said I look trustworthy. I don't know. I think journalists need help. Maybe if you go inside, your conscience will wake up. You're Poles. The shipyard is Poland now. - Lofty words. - But true. When Maciek's father came here, he was a formed man. Maciek had to be forged, like iron. - You forged him? - Life did. The kind of life we had in Poland. Hopefully that will end. He found out workers in Radom and Ursus were beaten. He decided to protest. Alone. - Introduce me to him. - When they let him out. They will one day. I don't know if he'll want to talk to us. - You think it makes sense? - You don't? You wrote: “Stop beating workers of Radom and Ursus”. - Is that right? - Yes. You appealed to the authorities not to do what they're doing. - So? - You think they'll listen? - People read it. - How many posters were there? - Five. - How many people read it? - I don't know. - Let's say a hundred. Will he lay off? He wants you to calculate your profits and losses. L'm not an accountant. A hundred people read it and you did three months. - Is that a good balance? - Next time it'll be better. If you run faster, you'll put up ten posters. L'll take some gasoline and set the party committee on fire. - Like in December 1970. - Don't be stupid. - You didn't do it? - We're smarter now. So? You don't burn committees, you set up your own. You want to decide for people. It doesn't make sense. People are lazy and scared. Nobody can do it for them. They have to do it themselves! L'll do everything myself. Let them beat me or kill me. - Your father didn't think that way. - He was stupid! How dare you! All right. He was na'I've like a little child. He fell for it! As usual! He believed what Kocio'rek said and went back to work. He urged others to do so. And they did. People were killed and he's to blame for it. It's his fault that people died! Maciek! Stop it! Don't say that. Don't. What's going to happen? The government will change and we'll sign an agreement. If not today, then tomorrow. Soon. - I want you to be there. - Thank you for trusting me. I just want you to be the person you were ten years ago. Don't ever change. I know you have talent. You're just lost. Like all media people. You'll get the best pass there is. They'll let you inside the conference room. And witness a historic moment. When it finally comes. If it comes. I hope you find yourself in a new Poland. Let us pray for all workers on strike. Let us ask Mother of God to watch over our prudence and solidarity and to give us strength and hope. Let us pray that Jesus Christ will help us solve our problems. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed are though among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Hello? Winkel? Come downstairs. l'm waiting in the restaurant. Wrong number. What time is it? It's time you went upstairs and to the right. Go. Leave your luggage. l'll take care of it. Our services are reliable. Good evening. I dozed off. I was tired. Have a seat. What are you all scared of? - You're trembling like a leaf. - What? The jimjams. No way. We have prohibition. Don't worry. Soon things will get back to normal. It's good to give your liver a break. Thank you. Nasty stuff, right? Let's get to the point. Give me what you've got. L've got a lot but I still have to work on it. Give me a couple of days. Mr. Winkel, l'm not just any TV guy. Spare me your witty answers. - Did you get inside? - Where? - The shipyard gate. - lt's not that easy. Stop dodging- Somebody will get pissed off and kick the shit our of you. - Do you have any contacts? - Yes. Your first story will be on in two days. What? Editing alone will take... Editing? lt's not your problem. Get inside that gate and do yourjob. You know what the boss is interested in. Second-line people. That guy Tomczuk... You mean Tomczyk. They have no second line. Are you sure? You'll find out that anti-socialist elements are hiding in the second line and are feeding on the working class protest. How will I get inside with a crew? They only let foreigners in. If I could get in there myself, I wouldn't ask you or pay for your hotel. No way! What do you want? You can't make me. - L'm not a... - What? An informer. Really? Who do you think you are, shflhead? - You signed, didn't you? - What? For the car, money, files. L've got receipts. Don't struggle when you're neck deep in shit. Or you may drown. See you in two days. Goodbye. Where are you going? Come to my room. Well? - You have fifteen minutes. - But Captain Wirski... He's not my superior. I have a wife and kids. I don't want trouble. I was dragged through courts because of him. She won't tell you anything. She's a cheeky bitch. Let's go. Now we're both locked up. Hello. - I wrote you a kite. - I didn't understand a thing. I wasn't sure if you remembered me or wanted to talk to me. How did you get in here? I have my ways. - Who told you I was here? - Mrs. Hulewicz. You know her? She remembered my stories from 1970. The ones I got fired for from the radio station. You can trust me or not. I want you to know that the situation is... notbad. Is this room bugged? I don't know. Maybe. - They're starting an offensive. - Who? You have too many friends who believe in weapons. On caterpillar tracks. - They won't give in. - They will. The system won't stand it. It will. Take it easy. I got into a nice mess. lt's about Tomczyk. They're preparing a provocation. They want to make a scapegoat out of him. Who? They have evidence he has contacts with Radio Free Europe, the CIA. An informer, an enemy of socialism, a womanizer, an alcoholic. Aren't you exaggerating? Why are they on to him? I don't know. They say they're interested in second-line people. I bet they have something on everybody. - Did you see him? - Yes. He made a speech yesterday at the gate. He's a great gUY- Has he lost weight? They don't get any sleep. He looked haggard. But he's very confident. Maciek never broke the law. He did time. Because nobody respects law in this country. L'm in jail just because I support the strike. Believe me or not. I want to write a story about him. Call it expiation or opportunism. Whatever. I want you to help me. Tell me everything about him. His life, work, dreams. Did the chairman send you? Sort of. - L'm collecting materials. - For every possibility? Don't insult me. You know not everybody in radio and TV deserve to be beheaded. Almost everybody. No. l'm sure of it. People do what the situation lets them. What a convenient theory. Except the workers didn't accept it. They have nothing to lose. - Maciek said the same thing. - See? Do you have a cigarette? I quit when I was pregnant. Sometimes I crave for a smoke. - Did Mrs. Hulewicz help you? - We talked a lot. It's been a long time. - You've changed. - l'm much calmer now. L've calmed down. I used to be overambitious. I wanted to have everything whatever the cost. L've calmed down. To Maciek I was a freak. I know he was more mature than me, he understood more. He felt sorry for me. Life is so different here on the coast. You stop worrying about being both successful and virtuous. You know there are no prospects, but you feel at peace. You can say what you want and do what you think is right. It's great. And the baby. You knew me back then. I never thought l'd want to have a baby so much. You know how it is. You meet a man. And you want him to be the father of your baby. I made a choice and I never regretted it. Believe me. I do. Maciek wanted me to go back to making films. Our life here, our activity meant civil death. You don't do anything illegal, but you're outside the law. Sometimes it's very difficult. When you get used to it, it can be fun. Fun? Amusing situations happen. Besides, you meet and work with wonderful people. You enjoy outsmarting undercover policemen. It's really great not to be afraid of anything. When you sit in jail you think: “What can they do to me? They can't put me in jail”. So... - What did you live on? - You know how it was. I came here to find Birkut, to finish the film about him. I didn't know he was dead. Maciek worked as a welder in the shipyard. I didn't know the police had caught and beaten him twice. I didn't know anything. I explored the 1950s, never noticing Radom and Ursus. I had no idea Polish workers worked in such horrible conditions. I can tell you how a welder works in a ship's double hull. You don't have to. l've been a journalist for sixteen years. You have to know to understand. lt's really important. I met Maciek outside the shipyard. He told me how his father died. I decided to take him to Warsaw. I thought it would help. You can imagine how the TV guys reacted. Hello. - Is he in? - No. Please wait. We'll wait in his office. Come. I see you're here. Hello. lt's me again. This is Maciek Tomczyk, the son of Mateusz Birkut. Well? Nice to meet you. Stop fooling around. I want my crew, camera and tapes. - What for? - So I can finish my film. Where's the hero? You'll find out when you see the film. - I want to know now. - You'll miss the surprise effect. I want to know. - OK. Stand up. - Why? Because you have to show respect for what you're about to hear. Where's your father? He died in 1970 in Gdynia. - What are you saying? - He was killed by the police. He doesn't even have a grave. My film will tell his story. Give us a moment alone. Wait. What's going on? Can you go out, please? Yes. Are you out of your mind? You're dragging out the situation on the coast now? You're mad. You wanted a curtain, you'll get it. The guy attacks the authorities with a weapon and you make a saint out of him? You're blind and irresponsible. The party condemned that massacre. When? Six years ago! Now we have Radom and Ursus, burned committees, fights with police. And you want me to canonize Birkut? You're a nut case! It's time to pay the debt! lsn't it? Take it easy. - Your elementary school was free? - Yes. - High school? - Free! The state paid for your education in the film school. One million zloty! That's the debt you have to pay! Stop working against the country which invested in you! - Now get out! - Hands off! Tell that nice guy that our project is put off for now. We may come back to it. If we do, he'll be our consultant. Explain it to him. I don't want him to feel bitter. - You understand? - l'll make that film! Be it on 16 or 8 mm tape. Whatever it takes! Really? You have our pass? Give it to me. - Why? - I want to see it. Here. You don't have it any more. You'll never get inside this building again. L'll tell the chairman to ban you from work in TV and film. He'll do it once and for all. Now you can go and look for a newjob. There are so many beautiful professions. Good luck. You bastard! Good bye. Let's go. Hello. - How's your film? - Forget it! I found Birkut's son. Nice to meet you. Winkel. You look like your father. Mr. Winkel sent me to Gdarisk to do the story about your father. Why didn't you tell me that he was dead? I didn't want to scare you. They took the film from me. Where did he go? So that's the way it is. Let's go. Come to Gdarisk with me. Are you crazy? You have a camera. L'll introduce you to people who knew him. You'll make pictures of people, places. Everything. We'll have an exhibition. - Where? - I have a big room. We can hang lots of pictures. Are you coming? Let's go. Good evening. May I come in? I won't take long. - Have a seat. - No, thanks. l'll stand. What is this about? Instead of calling you to the office, I came to talk to you. May be we can work it out to avoid problems. What problems? You've made trouble before. We don't want that again. Why do you think it will happen again? - Because of this. - Can you be more clear? Why are you introducing her to all kinds of people who defy People's Poland? Why are you visiting places which ought to be forgotten? And you keep making pictures. What for? - Who is this? - Our personnel manager. Come on. ljust work in the personnel department. She's a photographer. I don't think so. You finished a film school, you have no licence. Anybody can make pictures. Depends of what. I see you want to make an exhibition here. You need a permit for that. I can hang whatever I want on my walls! You can do whatever you want as long as it's lawful. We can lawfully move you to a worse job. Really? On what grounds? You can get a job so low-paid, you won't take it. - You know what this is? - Whatever. I have an offer. Burn all pictures and forget about the personnel department. What if I don't? It's the hammer for you. The decision is on my desk. Think about it. Give us your answer tomorrow. Good bye. What are you doing? Don't you see what's going on? They're on to us before we even started. We can't do anything! We'll have that exhibition. Right! We'll hang a poster out: “To December Victims”! We'll invite our friends. They'll fire you and you'll go on social welfare. Then l'll hand out leaflets against unlawful lay-off. Do you know what will happen when you do that? It's a downslide. You know what's at the bottom? He was my father. Hush. lt's all right. I was devastated. That's when we spent our first night together. But I still didn't understand. It wasn't it yet. We both felt embarrassed. I thought it was just a fling. Nothing serious. When I got to know him better, I knew I wouldn't leave. He opened up to me like he never did to anybody else. He's so... I can't explain it. I tried to leave. I wanted to go back to Warsaw, to pick up my career again, to make films. I packed and said goodbye. I thought l'd never come back. You fool! Why didn't you tell me? If only I knew... I didn't think it was possible. It never occurred to me that he treated me seriously. I thought he took me for a stupid pretentious egoist. He said that he loved me. I can't describe it to you. - What are you doing? - l'll call the shipyard. Are you crazy? Hello? Extension 157, please. It's Agnieszka. Can I speak to Maciek Tomczyk? I have a list of 88 shipyard workers fired after 1976. You have guaranteed that workers on strike and their supporters will not be persecuted or oppressed. Can we be sure that you won't find false witnesses and stage sham trials, accusing the strike committee of being criminals? Mr. Prime Minister, Commission members. This is a major issue. Will we have a police or a democratic system? We don't want unity enforced by police truncheons. - These are far-going conclusions. - Maybe it's sheer demagogy. But every day people are arrested for having different political views. I have a list of people who were arrested without being charged. They're in jail just because their views aren't “compatible”. I can give you that list. You used words which I find offensive. How can you say that we'll accuse workers of being criminals? I feel personally hurt. I treat everybody here as honest people. How could anybody treat you with disrespect? I get threats that they'll deal with me. In that case they'll have to deal with me as well. If an old teacher has to go to the other end of Gdarisk to attend church service because she's scared, it's not normal. It can't work. Agnieszka? Where are you calling from? You got disconnected? Give me a cigarette. Your last one? It's OK. No. What was I saying? Damn it. Workers started to meet and criticize the system. Is that when he began to conspire? - What do you mean? - I mean free trade unions. - Be precise. - OK. The free trade unions didn't exist yet. It all just started. We read the constitution. We didn't do anything illegal. Something funny happened. Maciek asked me to marry him. He asked If I wanted to marry an unemployed worker. We got married. I was never a religious person. As a child I went to church to please my parents. But when I met Maciek, I wanted a church wedding. I felt it was something we had to do. May God Almighty give you his blessing. May He bless you and your children. May He help you in prosperity and in ordeals. May He bless everybody here. In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Maciek, I wish you all the best. Best wishes on your serious path of life. If you have any problems, you can always count on us. Thank you. Thank you again. This is a democratic marriage, so share the flowers. L'm not here for littering. I want to answer for what I was really arrested for. For founding free trade unions, for organizing celebrations to honour December 1970 victims. Not for littering. It's ridiculous. People took the leaflets. There was no litter. Agnieszka, it's not much. Everybody chipped in. We'll collect money every month until Maciek gets out ofjail. - Here. - I can't take it. l'll manage. Please. Maciek would take it. It's not charity. We want to show our solidarity. Take it. OK. Thank you. I guess we'll go. Goodbye. Good bye. - Where's the baby? - Come. Take your coat off. People were better informed, they read KOR newsletters. They talked more openly about everything. What happened next? We moved in with Mrs. Hulewicz. That's when it really got rough. - Hands off my baby! - Maciek, don't! Let's go. Good bye. Where did you go? It's no secret. One of them followed me on the train. They knew where I was. My father lives in a small town. The baby is with him now. - Did they arrest you there? - No. The shipyard was still working. Things were getting hot. When I found out about the strike, I didn't want Maciek to be alone. I got on a train and I was arrested. - What can they do to you? - Nothing. They've lost. lt's just a matter of days. - What if you're wrong? - We'll carry on. You know what Birkut told Maciek back in 1968? A lie cannot live for long. Do they beat you here? They stopped beating political prisoners. Are you afraid? Yes. Whatever happens, l'll get kicked in the ass. Tell me about free trade unions, publications, distribution. See you in the shipyard. - Did you get anything out of her? - A bit. You think they can win? Good bye. Take your shoes off! You were to call me. Do you mind if I smoke? In here? I need another two or three days. You have to smoke? Take up sports. My story is not ready yet. OK. I won't smoke. I gave you those files and we made a deal. What if it's off tomorrow? I think l'll smoke. I won't litter. Go ahead. People lose their manners around those workers. We can't do anything without orders. But we're ready. I tell you, take up sports. Those files are not good enough to contrive your little script. Watch it! But thanks anyway. I met some wonderful people. Remember that night when you were drunk driving? You crashed into a wagon, killed horses, injured a driver. Were you charged? No. I have a file on you. You bastard! Your shoes! Put me in jail and lay off! - Can I use your phone? - Go ahead. - I want to call Warsaw. - Dial - lt's tapped. - Never mind. Hello? Secretary's office. Winkel here. Can I speak to the boss? - He's not it. - Give him my message. “L resign. I guess l'm too old for this. Shipyard workers have won. I wish them all the best”. Excuse me, which boss do you mean? I don't get it. - You don't listen to the radio? - Nobody listens here. The old bosses are gone. We have a new management. You want me to leave a message? Just say I resign. Thank you. Good job. Maciek! It was not easy. Negotiations were hard and took a lot of effort. But they concerned important issues. I stand by everything we said earlier. We talked the way we should talk with each other. Like a Pole with a Pole. I also stand by another thing. There are no losers or winners. No defeated or victors. I deeply believe that this is the best testimony of our Polish patriotic intentions. We want to serve the interests of the working people, our socialist homeland - People's Poland. Can we have the final documents? Let's sign them. I said from the beginning we would win. And we won. lt's true! L'll be the last one to leave. God bless you! l'm going back to work! Dzidek! I can't believe it! We did it! You don't need to hide this anymore. Get out of here. It's not like that. This man told us everything. Forget about shaking hands. I can explain. At least say goodbye. You already did. Thank you! Lech! Mr. Winkell Don't look so upset. This agreement is not valid. The law doesn't recognize agreements signed under force. It's just a piece of paper. I want to tell you that we won. We did what we wanted in 1968 and in 1970. I know we'll never let them divide us again. We'll never let them deceive us. We'll get through the worst. L'm sorry I had little faith in you. I still think it's a dream. But it's the truth. We all saw it and nothing can change it. I hope you're proud of me. That's all I wanted to tell you. The boys of Gdynia, brothers and sons, today the police used their guns. We stood up bravely, fighting off. Janek Wiéniewski died. They carried his body on wooden planks against the cops, against the tanks. Shipyards boys, avenge your friend. Janek Wiéniewski died. Petards and tear gas fly in attack, heavy blows fall on workers' backs. Children, women, no one is spared. Janek Wiéniewski died. One man is wounded, another killed, at dawn in December blood was spilled. Authorities ordered to shoot workers. Janek Wiéniewski died. Shipyard workers, don't get closer, better go home, the fight is over. The world found out but said nothing. Janek Wiéniewski died. Mothers, don't cry, you must know the shipyard has a flag with a red bow. For bread, freedom, and a new Poland. Janek Wiéniewski died. Mothers, don't cry, you must know the shipyard has a flag with a red bow. For bread, freedom, and a new Poland. Janek Wiéniewski died. English subtitles: lwona Moreno STUDIO PUBLISHING
