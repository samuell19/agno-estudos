Bucking Bronco * (Thai moonshine + herbs) BROTHER OF THE YEAR Mighty Elephant Thai folk song. Yes. Okay? - Yes. Excuse me! Pick one. Hurry. Buffalo Bill Whoa! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! More, more. Good? Okay! Force of the Tiger Womanizer Infallible Wood Come in. Make yourself at home. Wait. Just a sec. Seriously, you live with your mum? Yes. Your mum or wife? Mum. My mum when she was young. Where's she? Studying abroad. Okay, I'll believe you. The speaker's broken. Here. Too bad, huh? So… there's no intro. We can get straight to the hook. Holy shit! We have to call our client early in the morning. Oh! I thought you were coming back on Sunday. It's past midnight on Saturday, so it's Sunday. Oh. This is your mum? Sister. Take it off. She's just borrowing it. It's all right. Take it off. It's mine. How can you let her wear it? Who is she? Do you even know her name? Huh? What's my name? It's Aoy. What? Name? Kate. Right? Chompoo. Ann? Nope. I've been gone for 4 years, do you do this every day? Do what? - I told you not to bring girls back home. Why not? It's my house too. Do you have any brains? Huh? Stop using only your balls. - Hey, be nice. Don't mess with the family jewels. Fine. Jane, open it. - No. If you wanna fool around, do it outside. Understand? - What's with you? What now? She's already left. Huh?! If you don't care about me, at least care about my friend. If you do it again, I'm gonna tell Muay for real. Okay, fine. Sorry, Mum. I won't do it again. Please. I won't do it again. Really. That's all. Sleep outside tonight. Coochie. Jane. It's not funny. I'm your older brother! It's been ages since anyone's called me that name. But once Jane's back, this name is back too. I really hate this name. Actually, my name's Chut. When I was a kid, I dreamt of having a younger brother. Uncle, why are you late? Hurry, Chut. Your mum is in labour. Hold on tight. Hey, John. Lil' John. My bro. John doesn't fit the baby anymore. It's a girl. It felt like the whole world was falling down. Chut. You're a big brother now, love your sister a lot, okay? I was forgotten. Everyone doted on Jane. Uncle, take me to see Seng, please. Chut. And when she got older, her flawlessness and perfection made me a total loser in everyone's eyes. What's with your grades, Chut?! Social Studies, Maths, Computer, all F. You even got an F in English. You're a halfie! Are you collecting F's? Wow... Look here, straight A's. Of course, she's good at everything. (reading traditional Thai poem) Great, keep it up. Who would want to be your big brother? Chut, get out of the way. We only need a photo with Jane. Oh, I'm here as her guardian. Being a big-loser-brother, what's the big deal? Could you please move to the left a little? No, not that way. I meant to your left. A bit more. Perfect. Okay, say cheese. Damn her. Just wait, she's gonna get it. The lowest point of my life was when I let her play baseball with me. Fireball! Hey, Chut. - He's bleeding. Anyone have a handkerchief? - It'll be dirty. This is better. Laurier really is absorbent. Is that a chin or a pussy? It's got a pad stuck to it. Pussy. Hey, don't call him that. Call him Coochie better. That works. Coochie. Coochie. I woke up to a new name 'Coochie', which Jane gave me. Coochie. Since when do the youngers name the older ones? I'm 5 years older than you! Coochie, why don't you put the food in the bowl? Too lazy to wash it. - You're so lame, even with small things, I'm not surprised that your life is always lame too. So, all those who eat from the baggie are lame too. Why don't you close the seat when you're done? She's so fussy with me about everything. I don't wanna touch your piss, understand? You won't. Just touch this part. - How's that not possible? I didn't piss all over it like this, you see. Luckily, I was released from this torture, when she got a scholarship to study in Japan. Coochie, I'm leaving now. Sayonara. Sayo-tempura. The day she left to study abroad... was the day I was dreaming of. It was heaven! 4 years of total bachelorhood. 4 years. Damn! Why did it go so fast? God damn it! It's over. So lame, loser, useless. Every little girl's fantasy is to have a big brother, like the song 'The Best Big Brother'. This song… Two siblings walking together. Lil' sister following big brother. So that I could play boyish games. Just shoot it. Arsenal's in the lead. Crazy about football like him. You're one point ahead, right? If you score half a ball, then you win, got it? Read the same comics. This, then this and this. Why do they read from the back to the front? Because it's the Japanese way. Only this side. Get to copy his cool moves. Or even play baseball with him. Fireball! But having a big brother like Coochie... Darn it, Jane! That's mine, don't colour in it. Can't I? No! Give it back. Darn it! The best big brother. That singer is such a liar! Think about it, he's 5 years older than me. Instead of helping me with homework, look… Chut, this year you have to study with Jane. And please try to pass this time. I'm tired of regrading you. I'm so embarrassed to have a big brother like him. Loser. I could do Excel since I was in grade 4. What fatty? I'll poke you blind. Miss? May I go to the toilet, please? If I have to study in the same class as him, I'd rather skip class. When I had to move to Bangkok to study, Mum put a down payment on this house for us. Did you find it? It's just the two of us. Instead of the older taking care of the younger, it's me who has to take care of him. See. The light works. Why are you lying there? What a burden. The only time Coochie wants to be the big brother, is when a guy likes me. I'm Bon. - What Bon? James Bond? Bon Jovi? Just Bon. Why don't you look trustworthy? Just Bon. Are you hitting on my sister? Sometimes, I wish I were an only child. It's an owl, not a tiger. You didn't have to scream that loud. Is the owl your pet? You should return it. What now? The owl. My client moved abroad. So, I have to take care of it for now. So, are you an AE or a slave? I'm trying to send it to them. What took you so long? I just said, I'm trying. Why the fuss? What do I eat it with? Toast. Go toast it yourself. Coochie... No!! Gross, who's gonna eat after you? Gross? - Yeah. So disgusting. What? Why are you all dressed up? Meditation retreat? Job interview. Graduating abroad isn't enough to get a job. You gotta have style. I'm off. Yeah yeah. You're damn cool. How can I help you? Hi. I'm here for a job interview. Please go inside and turn right. Thanks. Mr Kaiwa. She looks so young. Will she be able to handle the job? But I like this look. Kinda halfie. I think she understands us, Moji. "Shiruku, fresh smell for 7 days." What are your thoughts, Ms Jane? From information on the internet, more men are doing household chores. I believe they're also doing their own laundry. But no one has done any marketing targeted to this group. But you probably have a missus who does your laundry, right? Missus? I mean wife. I'm still singer. You meant 'single', right? Single. Super single. Single, single all the way. And how about you? Who does your laundry? Catch! I do it myself. It's odd a beautiful woman like you, still single? Or... do you have any problems? Ms Jane. Is there something wrong? Nothing. It burns. Burns? Burns. Burns? It means that it reality hurts. Well, then I apologise. It's all right. It's funny. I think she's your dream partner. One more question, Ms Jane. Do you play baseball? Yes? It's our new employee initiation. What's this feeling? She's one woman who looks so charming holding a baseball bat. Today I'll show her how cool I am, and make her my girl! Are you sure you don't wanna change? I won't hold back. Throw it already. It's getting late. Strike. Strike. You've got 2 strikes now. There's a certain rhythm when swinging. Think before swinging the bat. Shit! Did you play often in Japan? You're good. When I was a kid, I used to play with my brother. I didn't know Thai kids played baseball. Not really. But my brother was crazy about this comic and played. So, I was crazy about it too. The comic 'Sayonara Home Run'. Ryo, Baseball Thunderclap. Fireball! Hey, hey. You two still trying to make homeruns? Go home. Whoa, you know the death moves too. When I was a kid, I was obsessed. How come you speak Thai so well? Although I grew up in Japan, my dad is Thai. But he died when I was young, so he didn't have a chance to teach me. I had to persevere and practice from karaoke. Persevere. That's a hard word. What Thai song uses this word? No.7 study hard, persevere, don't be lazy. Oh, yeah! All good kids must have 10 responsibilities. Snow isn't as fair as this. I can't believe that you know this song. Why are you so dressed up? To work. I've been working for a month, haven't you noticed? What's for breakfast? There. You have a meeting with a client today. Aren't you in a rush? It's pouring like this. My client isn't awake yet. What's this? Your presentation? Can I see? - Leave it alone. Stop it. Nosy. Hope it sells. For sure. Look who you're talking to. Are you really gonna pitch it like this? Yeah, they're already different. Baldy Kaiwa will buy it no matter what. Muay. Don't listen to Jane. You know she hates me. No... So, what do you want then? Well, it's up to you then. My phone's dying. I'll call you later. Oops, bye. Excuse me. Could you take a look at this? I'm not sure what I did wrong. It says 'error'. Actually, it's for your Shiruku work. What should I do? - You'll break it. Calm down. That's not right. Chill. Oh. The paper's stuck here. Go wait over there, okay? Am I in the way? Get up. - Getting up. Move back. More. There. Stand on this. Don't move. Stand on it. Yeah. Don't move. When it says 'Paper Jam', snatch it out of this slot. And then pull the paper out. I said stand on the paper. - I am. Get up. You're an intern, right? - Yeah. What's your name? - Dear. You're still a student, why are you dressed like that? Why is it so short? Do you have a hidden agenda? You can't. Dress more proper. Are you going clubbing? Let me be myself. But you're an intern. Don't look, then. I'm not. Don't dress like this. - See! Dress properly. - Okay. And when it says 'Paper Jam', take it out like... pull it out like this. Simple. Close it too. See, you can't fix it either. Wait... Can I get off now? Morning, Mr Moji. Good morning. Hello. - Come in. Have a seat. Mr Moji. Yes? Shiruku's new idea really hits home. - Thank you. Targeting male customers. This audience analysis has a lot of vision to it. Thank you. Mr Moji, you're my dream client. Thanks very much. Awesome. - Thank you. Ms Jane, welcome. This is Ms Jane, our new Brand Manager. She's the one behind this idea. This idea? - That's right. Hello, everyone. Mr Saito assigned me to be Mr Moji's assistant. I'm taking over the detergent account from Mr Kaiwa, who's taken over the window cleaner account. It's great to be a part of the team. Oh. Mr Chut, you're Zono's AE, right? It's Sono. From the brief that I received from Sirugu… Hold on, I'm sorry. It's Shiruku. Could you also pronounce our brand correctly? Okay. According to... Shi.. Ru.. Ku's brief, targeting its male customers. We have 3 print ads for you to choose from. The first one, a new summer look. Convenient for mister, easy for missus. The second one. Convenient for men, easy for women. And the last one. Convenient for guys, easy for gals. How is it? Umm... Tsk-Tsk... I love all three of them. They're all equally good. It's so hard to choose. Ms Jane. You might think that they're the same, but they're really different. Okay. If using synonyms makes them different, then it's different. Next time you don't have to bother with choices then. Just make a really good one would be better, Coochie. Who's that? Oh, Mr Chut here. Back home, we call him Coochie. Oh, you're both from the same town? We live in the same house. Sometimes... we even share the same bed. We're siblings. Muay. Jane. Good morning, Moji. Good morning. We finally meet. Jane always talks about you. Yeah. - Close up for me too. Sure. This one will be picked up in the evening. Alrighty. - Thanks a lot. Thanks. No worries. Jane. Umm… I want to formally introduce myself to your brother. What do you think? But he already knows you. But not as his sister's boyfriend. You don't need to tell Coochie about us. Why? Or are you not confident in me? It's not like that. I don't want to involve him. Just let him be. He'll find out when it's time. But we're not doing anything wrong. Love shouldn't be kept a secret. If you wanna love, don't hide it. Love shouldn't be kept a secret. If you wanna love, don't hide it. We have to make it happen, you know. Yea yea yea! Oh my. Moji. You've been listening to too many Thai songs. Are you upset about anything? In Japan, clovers have a very good meaning. But it also means having secrets that can't be said, untold. As for lavender… - Another one. You used to live in Japan, do you know its meaning? It means. I have doubts about you. A whole bouquet. As for this… in Japan there's no other meaning. It's just our 1-month anniversary… Who's the slut now? What about you? Skanky? What? I'm just saying that you've been dressing slutty. Why? What have you been up to? Nothing. Nothing. Why the sharp voice? Coochie. Have you talked to Muay, yet? Huh? Nope. Why? Oh. Haven't you seen it, yet? She ranted all over Facebook. What rant? Someone like you aren't limited editions. Generic. A knock-off, fake, rip-off, a sissy. You dick! Did she mention any names? Nope. Just a #LoserChut!! #LoserChut!! Damn Muay, she's... - Hold it, Coochie. Don't talk about her in that way. Good for her. Reading it gives me satisfaction. Muay deserves a better man. You're a bad business partner. As a boyfriend, you're the worst. And how is kissing in public better than me? Wait. I pecked. And I pecked my boyfriend. Your boyfriend? - Boyfriend. You have a boyfriend. - Boyfriend. So? I have a boyfriend, and? Hello? - Hello, Mum. Yeah, what? I have something to tell you. - What is it? Your favourtie child, Jane. She may look all naïve. But she's really slutty, you know. She's got a boyfriend now. He's Japanese, too. - What? Why didn't she tell me? You won't approve, right? Wow, she's gone international like me. You're the one. Stop bringing home random girls. Your sis has moved back. - Come on, Mum. She's worse than me. There is a leaked clip of her. Huh? What clip? Send it to me. Now! - Okay. Hello? Chut? Have you sent it, yet? Sent. Oh, Mum. - Yeah? Don't tell her that I told you. Okay. I gotta go. I'll watch the clip. What did you send Mum? - What are you talking about? Let's watch it together. Can't believe your tried sending porn to Mum. You sent priming instead of porn. So retarded. Make sure there aren't any real ones. As for the clothes, we've changed it to red as commented. But I still have one problem. The location... has too much green. It reminds us of the competitor. The one we want to beat. But it's a yard. Isn't it supposed to be green? This is redoing the entire storyboard... Huh? Mr Saito said that the power of the brand's colour is essential. So, it's worth changing. Do you want a house without a yard? Okay. We'll redo the storyboard ASAP. Charging tigers! Yes! Next, we'll have the production house send the queues. The next step, Mr Gun, you can have the production house send the queues. And if there are any other details, I'll e-mail you directly, okay? Okay. It won't take more than a week. How long will it take? I said 1 week. 1 week. Jane. What's with you? I'm standing right here. Just chill, Chut. About 1 week. Okay, Mr Gun. Do you have a parking ticket? I'll stamp it for you. Thanks. Excuse me, I have to go. Geez, look at her. We've already changed the storyboard 3 times. They're the boss. And their comments... so damn stupid. Are they crazy? The yard's supposed to be green. How can everything be Shiruku red? They should do laundry in a Chinese shrine. Calm down, Chut. If they're keep being stupid, I'll sell this idea to their competitor. Mr Chut, you should resign from the team. Mr Moji, why so serious? I was just kidding. Thais always joke around like this. Japanese don't joke around, right? Even so, this is really a sensitive issue. If Mr Saito finds out, he won't be pleased. But Mr Saito doesn't know. It's just between the two of us. Are you going to tell Mr Saito? I don't have a choice. It's our company's policy. If you don't resign, we'll have to dismiss your company. Why so serious? Is this what you want? Be careful. The ending won't be pretty. The end is the end. It has nothing to do with being pretty or not. Right? Whatever. You better watch out. I'm gonna get you good. What do you want me to watch out for? I'm glad we're now on good terms. Do you understand what I'm saying? You make my blood boil! Blood boil... Are you hot? - What? Do you want some water? Is this what you want? I don't think Jane will agree. Mr Chut... You know? You're the guy in front of the florist shop, right? My apologies. Actually... I've never liked you. Don't make me hate you. Because... I can get Jane to break up with you. So, what will it be... Moji? Fine then. I'll keep this a secret. That's it. There's no need to be anal. Okay. I'm going now. You're gonna get it, tiger! Moji. You're worse than him. You didn't punish that guy because he's your girlfriend's brother? I think... you've been in Thailand too long. You've become passive. You're not using all your potential. In 2 months… there will be a shuffling of positions. You will have to go back to Japan to the head office. Start over again. Relearn our organisation's culture and ethics. You must go back. Moji, why did you defend him? Don't tell me he told you he'd make me breakup with you. How did you know? That's so damn Coochie. Does he even know what he's done? What a demon! But... I'm relieved... that Chut finally knows about us. What are we going to do now? What about the others? Aren't they coming? I didn't invite anyone else. Why are you playing only with me? When you move back, you'll get to play with better people. Think of it as a last farewell then. Okay. If I win, you'll have to take me out. But if I win... will you marry me? Moji. Don't do this, please. If you win, I won't bother you. I'll do anything you want. It doesn't matter whether it's been 2 months or 2 years. Love is love. Jane, what are you afraid of? Couples who get married early have an 80% failure rate. But if we break up right now, that'll be 100%. Aren't you going to listen to me? Fine then. If you want to play, then let's do it. I once thought... this is how I'd propose to you. Thanks. It's a very sweet proposal. But… I'm sorry, Moji. Jane. I'm burnt. Attention: Sono Advertising Co., Ltd. Shiruku Thailand would like to notify the shuffling of positions. First, Mr Mochikawa is to be moved to the Marketing Department at the head office in Japan. Second, we request Sono advertising company to remove Mr Chut from being Shiruku's AE. To be effective immediately. Mr Chut Reansuwan is to be removed from... Ms Jane Reansuwan, Brand Manager. Coochie: Is this how you wanna do it? Hello? Which Aey is this? Oh, Aey Anyaporn. About the quotation, right? Sure. I'll send it to you. Okay. Chut, the telephone wizard. He can talk to a ghost caller. Which Aey is he talking to now? Lay off. He's got time. Ms Jane's really cruel, firing her own brother. Chut: I'm still in the group! Shit!! Shit!! Busy? Nope. It's watching series or xeroxing. Wanna go clubbing? My treat. Okay. Let's go. This is fun. Didn't think you're into these places. Let's come again. Sure. Are you okay? I'm okay. Hey... You're drunk as a skunk. If I slap you, it wouldn't hurt, huh? I'm not drunk. If you don't believe me, try... How was it? - It hurts. My bad. Sober, Coochie? Don't use that name. I hate it. Your sister is so pretty, you know. But she's got such a sharp tongue. When I see you two, it's like you hate each other. Actually, I've never hated Jane. But... I just hate myself when I'm with her. You should tell her that. Tell her what? - Well... tell her, "Jane my dear, I don't hate you, sis. I just hate myself when I'm with you." "Love you, sis." That makes me wanna puke. No? No way. Huh. Do you have any siblings? So damn lucky. Hello. This way. Sorry for all the trouble. You could've just left him at the bar. The bar begged me to take him home. He puked up all his guts, he'll sleep well tonight. Are you really gonna leave him like that? Don't worry. He'll wash it off when he wakes up. Cut throat. You're not mad or hate Chut, are you? Why? Did he say something? - Oh. No. He's upset with work, so he's complaining. But, I don't really get it when siblings fight, does it have to be so dramatic? You're an only child, right? I'm lucky, right? Can I ask you a question? Why do you call him Coochie? Coochie, don't forget to pick me up from the LASIK clinic!! It's me, Moji. Moji. Thanks for picking me up. I told Coochie, but he probably forgot. So, I have to bother you. Sorry. You know you're really cute right now? You look like the Kamen Rider V8. Do you know Sky Rider? They've got big bug eyes. Moji, I'm not supposed to laugh. Let's go. I'll take you home. - Wait a sec. I... I don't want you to misunderstand me. I do love you. But... I'm worried about my family. I'm worried about my mum, auntie, the house, and Coochie. Please say something. Are you pouty? I can't see anything. I'm not mad at all. I understand... how it feels to be far away from family. So, I've already decided to leave Shiruku and find a new job here. You don't have to do that for me. Jane... I can live anywhere. All I need is you. We don't have to get married right now. Okay? Don't touch, you'll infect your eyes. The doctor will scold you. Moji. - Yeah? How many kids do you want? Four. Maybe two? The ring? Well... I have it with me all the time. I love you, Jane. Your family's already here. Chut said that he's representing your mum. Jane, right? You speak Thai very well. My husband was Thai that's why. You and Chut can speak Thai with Mum. She understands but doesn't speak it well. I can speak but you probably won't understand. Chut and I are the same, we're halfies, but we can't speak a word of French. Our dad went back when we were young. You can just tell them that he left us. Excuse me? Mum was asking how many kids we're planning to have. These two are workaholics. If they're gonna have kids, they'll have to pump a lot. - Pump? Pump. Pump? Pump! Pump! Pump! Hey! Why did you step on my foot? You'll have to give the kids hybrid names. Like it could be either Thai or Japanese. For example. If Japanese name is Tsubasa, then we'll call him Surasak in Thai. Oops. Sorry. Excuse me. That's enough, Coochie! Can't eat it anymore. It's now plum soup. I'm so sorry, Mum. All right, let's get to the point. To marry Jane, the dowry is... ten million. Coochie! Baht... not Yen. Is it normally this much? I can find it. Moji. Don't listen to him. Then you can't get married. It's not a problem. I'll do anything. All right, then. Jane. Jane. Jane and I have planned to get married next month. We're in a rush. But it should be possible. We're leaving to Japan 1 week after the wedding. Your honeymoon? No. Jane decided to move to Japan with me after the wedding. Why don't I know about this? I've already told Mum. - But she didn't tell me this. I'm sorry. I didn't know she has to move to Japan. So, no more marriage. Chut. - Sorry! Chut. Let's go home. - Chut. Let's go. - Coochie. Let's go. Can't we talk first? - No. No wedding. Let's go home. Go. You have no right to stop me from getting married. Why not? Mum said I was representing Dad. I'm not allowing it. You have no right. I know why you're doing this! You're upset with me and Moji about work, right? It's got nothing to do with that. Moji's a loser. What the hell. He has to move. Why force you to move too? Is he crazy? If he wants to marry you, then he should quit. Hey, Jane! Hey! Think more about it. It's only been a few months and now wedding plans? Are you out of your mind? Moving to Japan... How's it gonna last? Speechless. You're not that confident in Moji either. Think carefully. How are you gonna live over there? Who's gonna take care of the house? What about the payments? What now? Huh? Did you not like what I said? You've never done anything with this house. Me! It's me that does it all! The dishes, cleaning, laundry. It's all me! Coochie. You're so damn selfish! The reason I've said all this... is because I'm worried about you. Really? I don't think so. I think you're afraid. Afraid of not having your own slave. Paying the mortgage. I'm done talking. You know... at first I turned down Moji? Because I was worried... about how you're going to live when I'm gone. Do you know what a burden you are?! This house... you haven't even paid for half of it. Whatever you paid, I'll pay you back. And I'm gonna sell this house. And you'll have to live somewhere else. Don't run me off like some animal. I'm your big brother. And have you ever acted like one? You can leave whenever... but we can't live together anymore. Please forgive me for my rudeness. It's all right. Let bygones be bygones. I wasn't thinking when I asked for the dowry. When people love one another, money shouldn't get in the way of these feelings. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. I'm really glad... that we're going to be the same family. You don't have to worry about Chut. He's got nothing to do with this anymore. My mum gave me her blessing to marry Moji. My first grandchild will be as sweet as you. Are you listening? Jane. Forget it. It's my wedding gown. For my beautiful daughter-in-law. We're now the same family. "Because my husband was Thai." "Coochie, you have no right!" 1-9-4-0. Ooh. Welcome. Wow. They even play Cuban news in the toilet. It's awesome. Try... Wait! What are you doing? Sorry, I didn't mean to. I don't think of you that way. And all the dates we had together? What do you think I had in mind? So, you were fishing? Were you thinking of getting a catch? Is that it? Now what? Damn you. The place wasn't packed, huh? - No, it wasn't. That's good, so we can go back again. There wasn't a long wait. Yeah. It's past 2 p.m., I can't sell it. - It's only 2 minutes after. I was here before 2, but that guy was slow. I really can't sell it. Sir. I can't close the lid. It's okay. Chut. This is Mr Watanyoo from Thai Life Insurance. This is Chut, our top AE. Chut will take care of your account. Hello, I'm Chut. Hi, I'm Watanyoo. Just call me Yoo. Okay. Be careful of your cup, you might spill it. It's okay. Are you wet? I'm sorry. - It's okay. Get me some tissues. My apologies. Tissues. I looked the other way with Shiruku's case. When they pulled you off the team, I thought that was enough punishment. But what is this? You haven't even started your new project, and now I've caught you drinking in the office. I'm really sorry. Take a week off. We'll talk when you get back. What do you mean "We will talk"? I'll be straight with you. I don't know which account I should give you. When you're back and still want to work here, I might have to reduce your salary... or demote you. Are you trying to get me to leave? Bingo. Can't you help me? No one's called me back. What about your boss? Stupid. Who curses clients that often? I didn't kill anyone. Hold on. How did my getting fired spread to your office? Umm... You better tell them that I quit, I wasn't fired. Yeah. That's all. Dear. Yes? If you're free, please join. You can go with Mr Gun. For me? Congratulations. Thank you. How's Coochie doing? I haven't talked to him lately. He moved out to an apartment. I heard that... this week will be his last one. Dear... could you do me a favour? You got an invitation too? Are you going? It's far, Mahasarakham province. There isn't an airport either. You sound like you aren't going. I'll go. Of course. It's my sister's wedding. I'm sending you my friend's contact. He's looking for an AE. Take a look. Joe. Think of it as a farewell gift. Thank you. You're invited… what's your name? Dear-Raporn? Am I right? Kwan-Ruedear? Oh, Duang-Dear. This one for sure. Dear-Ratee. Right? I think you should attend. Mahasarakham. Wow, beautiful. You're as beautiful as me when I was young. Are you done? - Okay? So beautiful. Here once more. Tighter. Thank you. Why hasn't Coochie come back? He's not answering my calls. Please tell him that I miss him. I wanna drink beer with him. Watch your step. Jane, look at your mum. She's Moji's FC. I can't follow the game. What's with this song? Bobbing up and down. The ninja song. Is this the Japanese song you wanna sing for them? I couldn't guess it on my own. Will your brother come? Eat up. Your aunt can start her own comedy club. What are you doing? Here, let me help. It's hot. - Thanks. No worries. Be careful. Let me help. - Be careful. Hey. This is my old PE uniform. Do you see it? It's Jane. Is that... a 'C'? Chut's name? You wore his hand me downs? Not only his uniforms, but also all his old clothes. Convenient for guys, easy for gals. Coochie... you better come to my wedding. Joe. This work's from last year. These are the awards I won. Our team is very lucky to get one of Sono's top AE. Yes, sir. As agreed, you can start immediately. Already? - Of course. Why wait? Can you start tomorrow? Can I start next week? I have some business to take care at home. Too bad. What's brought you here, Reansuwan? Good evening, sir. Can I go in? Sure. Coochie: I'm here, hanging out at school. Coochie: I'll be home later. Jane: Where are you at? Coochie: On your right. There's Thai silk and a handbag from here. I want you to give it to Moji's mum. Here. I can give it to her tomorrow. What's the rush? Are you drinking again? It's not alcohol. It's just soda. Coochie... I'm leaving for Kitakyushu next week. I don't want to leave while we're still fighting like this. I'm sorry for throwing you out of the house. You don't need to apologise. How are you? Have you been to any interviews, yet? I might look shabby, but I got an offer. I got a new job. You know... that actually I'm very afraid of marriage and moving to Japan. Especially when you disapprove of it. It's not that I don't love Moji or afraid he might do something bad to me, but Japan... travelling and living there is very different. Living there... is quite stressful. Are you saying... that I've been right all along? So much, I'm quite mad. Don't think too much. How about... you have my blessing to get married and move there. Even though you don't need my blessing. Says who? No matter what, I need it. You represent Dad. Do you think Moji and I will last? Of course. Right? If you follow the 4 Truths of Buddhism, you'll last. The 4 Truths. Mercy, kindness, honesty, detachment. Wait a minute. That's the States of the Mind. Really? - Yeah. Oh. Are you trying to teach me the Buddhist scriptures? So mixed up. It works, right? I'm gonna go now. Thanks anyway. For what? - For coming to my wedding. Gosh! Stop with the flowers. Stop arranging it for a sec? Help me carry this to the car. You're such an obstacle to my transition. You know there's no testosterone left in me. I'll wait for you outside. Here. Is it necessary? - Just take it. I wanna give you one. - It's probably leftovers. Mr Chut Reansuwan and family. What family? Are you mocking me? If the young one marries first, the older one will be a spinster. It's a trick. Okay. I'm going to the hotel now. You can meet up at 4 or 5 p.m. Come on, Jane. Let's go. Let's go. Joe: I've already interviewed your brother. Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Don't forget to take me out. Hehe. Jane & Moji's Wedding Ceremony. Hello. Thank you. Your gift. - Thank you. Hey, Coochie. Oh, Seng. - It's been so long. What's up? Good, good. Let's go get tanked inside. All or nothing. Alcohol isn't served, yet. Let's warm up somewhere else. Hey, why are you parking here? What the… Have you caught anything? I got 2. Fish? Yeah. Can I buy? The rod? Yeah. It's expensive. - How much? Two. Thousand? Yeah. What? - I'll throw in the bait too. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Thanks to the chairman of the ceremony. But the ceremony isn't over yet. According to Japanese tradition, the bride will read her letter to her family. Ms Jane! Before I read my letter, I'd like to tell everyone here even though we've been together for a couple of months, I'm not pregnant. My letter to my family. I know that my family isn't perfect. When I was born, there was only my mum, who's a bit stingy. And my aunt... who remains single and won't leave my mum's side. She got you too. Mum and Auntie are both strong women, raising 2 naughty kids to be the adults we are today. I've never built a family before. I don't know how hard it'll be, but I think it must be very hard. By the time we catch any fish, I'll be eaten alive by the mosquitoes. Can I really ask you? Don't you want to go... Mum. Thank you, Mum. Every time I was in trouble... Is Coochie really not coming? Always helped me out. No matter which path I've chosen, Mum has always supported me. I should go. My wife must be looking for me. Will you take my wedding gift? I don't know what happened with the two of you. But… people get married once, dude. I might have to build my family in a far-off place... but I want everyone here to know... that you are my family. I will be my mum's daughter, my auntie's niece... and... Coochie… He's been an influence ever since I was a kid. I like reading Japanese comics because of him. When I grew up, I always like Japanese stuff. Studied in Japan, and I even have a husband that's half Japanese. And now that I'm married, I'm going to move to Japan. All of this is because of Coochie. And look. It's his own sister's wedding. Yet, I don't know where he is. Can I stop being his sister? But even if he might be the lamest big brother... there's no way we can stop being siblings. I'll try to find Chut. I'll be back. Did you find him? I couldn't find him. Holy shit! 80 missed calls! I'm dead! Coochie, dude. Hurry! 2 missed calls. Where have you been? Why didn't you go to your sister's wedding? Here. Did you know, she left the house in Bangkok to you? And look what you did. Does this make you feel good? Giving me the house. Finding me a job! Will you ever stop looking down on me? "Coochie can't find a job on his own." Right? It's embarrassing. Having my sister asking others for a job. You're better than me. Better at everything. Everyone knows. You don't have to try so hard. Yeah. I suck. I'm a loser, I know. So what? When you're gone... It's my problem if I sleep on the streets. Chut. Jane's just trying to help. She's worried about... I'm talking to my sister, stay out of it. - Coochie. That gift for his mum. Why? Are you afraid I'll give her something crappy? We all have to attend your wedding, or else you'd lose face? I'm not really wanted there, right? I know you've never been proud of me. I know. Having a brother like me… is it very embarrassing? Huh? If so... we don't have to be siblings anymore. That's all. Should I go after him? It's okay. Hello. Once I got settled here, Japan really isn't that stressful. Honey, I'm home. Welcome back. Bon appétit. Please eat up. Thank you. I'm off. It wasn't that easy at first. Sticky rice. Rice. It gradually got better. I'm home. Let me help. - It's all right. How are you lil' one? Hello! I got you a mobile. Ooh, it makes noise too. My family has gradually gotten bigger. If you think about it, it's almost perfect. Cheers. Okay? Yes. Hello. Hello Ms Dear. Please come wait inside. How are you, Ms Dear? Whoa. How long has it been since we last met? Jane's wedding, right? "Mmm"? You didn't even make it. Hey. Perfect timing. I'm going to Japan for work. Which city is she in? I might meet up with her. Umm... Some city. I've never been there. Some city? Nothing. Seriously, have you ever visited Jane? Don't you want to visit your nephew? How long has it been? When was the last time you saw her? Wow, Chut. I must say you really are a lame brother. What? I think... Jane'd like to see her big brother. When the bat hit him, I didn't even know myself. It was funny at first. But after he didn't wake up, I was frightened. A part of me thought how would it be if he really died. Everyone shut up! Call an ambulance. Thinking back... he had only busted his chin. But I cried all the way from school to the hospital. Chut, wake up. It was the most tragic moment in my life. Wake up, Chut. He's like a burrito. I'm jealous of people with siblings. Sayonara Home Run. So awesome. Coochie. You can do it. Coochie, fight on! Super Coochie fireball!! Mr Chut Reansuwan and family. Don't get too drunk. You have to send me off tonight. Mum. Auntie. Moji. How are you, son? I miss you. - Miss you too. My turn. How are you, Auntie? - I'm great. Say hello to Grandma. - Lemme see. Who is this? She's got pretty eyes. - Jane. Look who's here? Come to Grandma. Come on baby. Jane. I'll take care of it. You stay here. Go see your uncle. Hey, Coochie, try holding your niece. I don't know how, Mum. - Come on. Give it a try. Say hello to your uncle. Look at her face. She's not gonna hurt, right? She's still looking at her uncle. She must really love him. She must love him, huh? Mummy, I'm home! Hello Grandma. Welcome back. Ryo-chan. This is Uncle Coochie. Say hello to him. Hello Uncle. Come here. Ryo-chan, right? Huh? You're a big brother now. You got to love your sister lots and lots. Okay? Mummy. What did Uncle say? Fireball! C'mon. Yay. I caught it. Scene 58. Take... Cut. Cut 5. Take 3. Chut didn't see me, really? He doesn't know it's you. Jane... I got phlegm. Ouch! She got my eye. Coochie... Next week... I forgot the city's name. Kitakyushu. - Kitakyushu. Next week... I'm moving to Katakoshi. She's just making up names. Dear-Raporn? Kwan-Ruedear? Dear-Ratee? Dear-Thikamporn? Deary-Queen? Oh. Dear-Rangsit. For example. A name like... Oh! There's bones. Oh. Really? Is this the Japanese song you're going sing for them? Yeah! Whatever. Understand what I'm saying? I do. I forgot my lines. Damn it. What's next? I was wondering why you're scratching so long.
