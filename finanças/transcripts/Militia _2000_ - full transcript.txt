ANDERSON: Gentlemen, late last night, the Attorney General granted me authorization to stage a tactical raid on the Brotherhood of Liberty compound. It's the one we've been waiting for. It's where all our training and all our rehearsing is going to pay off. [helicopter whirring] ANDERSON: In less than two hours, with God's help, we are going to stop one of the largest illegal arms operations in history before they can sell any more AK-47s to high school kids, and before they blow up any more federal buildings. Now that is our mission. Our main objective is to take into custody this man right here, William Fain. And as many of his followers that are smart enough to surrender. [helicopters whirring] Here's your coffee. Thanks, honey. Damn thing won't start. Radiator. Got down to below 30 last night. I don't think it bothered you much. You sure kept me warm. Aww. What's the matter? You all right? Yeah. I'm OK. Where's Jimmy? [gun shot] Well, does that answer your question? I think he just shot a buffalo. ANDERSON: Now the rules of engagement are simple. We will not fire first. I don't want the stain of Waco on this mission. Now that said, we know that Fain and his men are motivated. He's trained them well. They very well may fire on us first. God help them if they do, because you men are better motivated and you're better trained than any of his men could ever hope to be. So gentlemen, strap on your vests. Cinch them up tight. Those two mil of Kevlar may be the only thing standing between you and the almighty. [clears throat] You have something to add, Carter? No, sir. You said it all. Very good. Gentlemen. [helicopter whirring] Roger, base. We have target in sight. They're coming! William! Get inside, Rachel. Go on, go on. Right now! Please! Get in there! Jimmy! What we gonna do, William? We all knew this day would come some time, well this is it. We will exercise fire discipline as we have been trained. And we will wait, I said wait, until they fire on us first. We don't want a war. OK, take your position. Jimmy! Come on, buddy. [gun shot] Taking ground fire! Great. Fire at will. I repeat, fire at will. Daddy! It's all right. Better at the center of the compound. Take him down! He's got his kid, sir. You sons of bitches! Carter, that's a direct order, goddamnit! Jimmy! Christ. Jesus Christ! Hang in there, buddy. Shit. Shit. It was a deliberate miss. Just give them what they want, William. They want our lives, Rachel. But that's something they're going to have to take, and it's going to cost them. Give me some suppressing fire along that fence row. Going hot. Get their fucking heads down. Fire! We are federal agents. Throw your weapons outside and exit the building. Please, William. Do what he says. I can't do that. You said you didn't want a war. I don't. This is their war, not mine. Please give up. They're going to kill us all! William! Good idea, Tom. Christ. Bastards! That's more like it, Carter. Take her down. William! Ah, shit. Tom, get my family inside the mess hall. Lock them inside. Go on. Go on, son. No daddy, I won't! Go on, do what I tell you. No! Your mommy needs a man to protect her now. That's you, ain't it? Now go on. Do what I tell you. Go on with Tom. Go on. Go on. You bastards! It's OK, Jimmy. It'll be over soon. Cease fire. All right, gentlemen. Let's move in. Carefully! Are you Fain? You and your men are under arrest for multiple felony arms violations and the murder of federal agents. We were defending our property. This is illegal trespass what you're doing. Wrong. I've got a federal warrant for the search of these premises. I didn't catch the name, officer. Anderson. Well, I tell you what agent Anderson. You can take that warrant and stuff it where the sun don't shine. The only thing I want from you is my phone call and somebody to get your fucking bullet out of me. Well, it ain't mine. That belongs to Agent Carter here. Bobby, cuff him. Carter, get this piece of shit out of here. Yes sir. [yelling] Torch it. Torch all of it. RADIO: Roger that. Rachel! Jimmy! Jimmy! [screaming] [crying] Must have blown their own ammo. They killed my boy. [crying] [crying] We're closed. Can I help you guys? - I don't think so. Thank you anyway. [beeping] We're in. All right. You've got three minutes to get the merchandise. I'll set the charges. Fred. Fred, how many times have I told you? Fred! Shit, Fred! [alarm sounding] [beeping] MAN ON PHONE: Section 20. This is MP Copeland at post 51. We have a breach. We have a breach. One man is down and intruders may still be on the premises. Please advise. MAN ON PHONE: Copeland, do not attempt to apprehend. Alert local authorities and stay at your post. Sir, all panels have been decoded. Request permission to go to icon four. MAN ON PHONE: Permission granted. [alarm continuing] [police sirens wailing] [tires screeching] [beeping] [beeping] We're in business. [beeping] [buzzing] Well, hello boys. Right on time. [beeping] [gun shots] MONTGOMERY: Nonlethal fuel supplies. That's all the terrorists got, according to the statement released by the Pentagon. But I'm getting off the track here, fellow patriots. What I meant to say is, I think we only need to look in one direction to find the culprit here. And that is directly at Washington D.C. and their minions in the UN. I mean think about it, folks. Who else would kill their own to justify an all out-war on our personal freedoms? They did it at Ruby Ridge. They did it at Waco. They did it at Oklahoma City. And then they tried to cover up their jackboot tactics by pointing the finger directly at those of us who love freedom and who seek only to preserve the legacy bequeathed to us by our forefathers. Oh fellow patriots, a new world order is coming. A dictatorship like none the world has ever seen. Now some of you people, you go to sleep at night and you think, "Oh, no. It can't happen here." Well, let me tell you something, patriots. It can. Now it won't happen all at once. No, no, no. They're too clever for that. No, like a thief in the night they'll come. And Americans are going to wake up one morning. They're gonna look around, and they're going to cry, "What happened? Why didn't somebody warn us?" Well, this is your warning, fellow patriots. This is your wake up call. This is George Armstrong. My mama would've called me Custer, but that space was already taken. Montgomery. Until tomorrow That's so clever. It's just so clever, you know? Dressing up anti-Semitism and racism as anti-government anger. He's really such a piece of work. Yes he is. Good old mad Monty. I'm Julia Sanders, I'm out from Washington. Ethan Carter. I know. Heard a lot about you. From? Deputy Director Anderson. Actually he had a lot of nice things to say about you. Yeah, I'll bet. What, do you think I'm bullshitting you? I think that's entirely possible, yeah. And what would I have to gain from that? I don't know, but I'm sure there's something. Look, normally I'm only about half as much of an asshole as I am right now. Dora, thank you. But there are certain names that tend to put my mood right into the shitter, and Anderson's is at the top of the list. So if you don't mind, I'm just gonna go back to my little cubicle, finish my day's work. You can go back to Washington and tell Anderson what a swell guy I think he is, and everybody'll be happy. Why don't you tell him yourself? Carter, good to see you again. You too, sir. Why don't you have a seat? Miss Sanders, have a seat. Gentlemen, this is Ethan Carter. Sanders you already know. This is Major Wilson, Captain Platt, and Captain Vandermeer. Agent Carter is probably one of our best field men. Very possibly one of the best rifle shots I have ever seen. I can't think of anyone else I'd rather be with on an op when the fur starts to fly. He's teamed up with Sanders here on this assignment. Our plan is to infiltrate him into the Brotherhood of Liberty, and see what kind of intelligence he can gather as to what militia group is responsible for the theft of the anthrax. Excuse me, sir. Anthrax? Sanders, why don't you bring him up to speed on this? Listen to me, sweetheart. You can bring him up to speed on your own time. I don't have time to waste on this thing. It's real simple. We need the anthrax, fast. Well, we've been working around the clock on just that task, major. Well, obviously not hard enough. Besides, I don't buy your little theory about homegrown militias being behind this. Well actually, right wing extremists have become quite sophisticated in recent years. Ah, bull shit. That attack was planned and conducted by pros. Matter of fact, it was a precise military operation with C4 charges everywhere we looked. Now, half your militia redneck freaks? They can't even read. Well not only can they read, sir, but they've been organizing themselves on the internet. And those "freaks" as you call them, most of them have been trained by the US military. Now we have very strong evidence to believe that the Brotherhood of Liberty-- Our profile does not include rednecks with AK-47s. Why don't you just let her finish there, major? What, am I going to learn something new? I got to tell you. It's hard enough working with you people in the first place, but that's just the way it is. I wouldn't be sitting here listening to this garbage if the law allowed us to operate on US soil against US citizens. The Constitution's a real pain in the ass sometimes, isn't it? Carter. You know, Mad Monty would have a blast with this guy. Kicks into everything he's talking about. Carter, that's enough. Actually, no sir. I don't think it is. These guys come in here. They ask us to risk our lives because they can't keep track of their little toys, and then they have the balls to pull attitude. Watch out, son. Because you don't know who you're fucking with. Oh, actually, I think I do. Really? Yeah. You're what, 40? 42 years old? Probably been passed over for colonel two or three times by now. And right about now you're thinking, "You know, this is about it." Am I close? We'll get your fucking anthrax back for you. Just remember to send us a nice little thank you note. You can attach it to one of those $600 toilet seats you guys are so, so fond of. You're going to be hearing from the Pentagon, Anderson. Carter, I'm gonna be seeing you. Gentlemen. Haven't changed a bit, have you? People tell me I've mellowed, sir. Well, you don't screw around as far as surprises are concerned, do you? You're wasting your time if you think he's going to tell you anything about the brotherhood. You're right. He probably won't. But he has agreed to infiltrate you into the group. He what? Everything is set up. You and Fain are going back into the brotherhood. We sent out a phony press release stating that his conviction had been overturned because we bad old boys in the ATF didn't have a warrant. We fired first and all that crap. Now you are a prison buddy who is sympathetic to the brotherhood. Sanders is going to be your control on this mission. This Sanders. That's right. She's an analyst, sir. I have completed the full field training course. Well how nice for you. Tell me this is a joke. I can't. It's not. Jesus Christ. Why don't you just send her in? I mean, she has completed the full field training course. You know that the militia is a man's world. Women have babies, they load guns, and they cook. What do you want me to do, steal their recipes? Enlighten me sir if you would please as to why a man that I shot two years ago would suddenly just waltz me in, get me all cozy with his buddies, and then sit back and watch while we put them in jail? Mr. Fain was not the most popular person in the federal penitentiary. His experience wasn't as enjoyable as he thought it might be. He is very receptive and open to any solution that might spring him early. And you actually trust him. I don't have to. You do. Here, he likes these. Go get 'em. That's good. Take the cuffs off him. I got it from here. How's the shoulder? Oh, swell. Never felt better. How's the conscience? Never better. Sit down. You must be pissed, Anderson hooking us up like this. No, as a matter of fact, it was one of my conditions. I specifically asked for you, Carter. Sounds like you want revenge. Revenge, yeah. I want revenge. But I want my freedom more. Enough to sell out your friends? Friends. My friends are either dead or in prison. Anyone left from the brotherhood who was at my compound wasn't man enough to stand and fight that day. The new brotherhood, I don't know any of those people. Yeah, but they do know you, don't they? Yeah, right. I'm a hero. Assuming we do get inside, how do I know that once we're inside you won't just kill me? You see my hand? You see that? Yeah. Your friend Anderson put a tracking chip in there so they can track me wherever I go. If I meddle with it, they come and pick me up, kill me, whatever. So you see, Carter, I got incentive. I'm what you boys like to call motivated. So let's just do this thing, and get on with it. What do you say? I have the file on my desk. I have no idea how long it's going to take. It's in your hands 'til then. There we go. All right. Say hello for me. Excuse me? Your mother, say hello from me. Oh, by the way, we're still on company time and-- ah, yep-- personal emails are kind of a no-no. What, are you reading over my shoulder? First of all, I'm nowhere near your shoulder. Secondly, I can't even see your screen. Then how do you know? I'm just watching your fingers. Watching my fingers. Yeah. OK. Carter is a wonderful man. Carter is an immature asshole. OK. I guess I deserve that. Is this one of your half an asshole moments? Yes. Enjoy it while you can. Does it ever get down to a quarter? Once, but the wind was blowing. So it doesn't really count. Thanks for jumping in today, with the major. Guy had it coming. Well, I appreciate it. It almost made up for what you said later. About you having no experience? Mm-hmm. I'll tell you the truth. That's still bothering me. What am I supposed to do about it? Short of actually getting experience, I guess there's nothing you can do. I'm sure it'll work out fine. Yeah. We seem to have a problem. You got something on your mind, go ahead. Spit it out. You want to know hat my problem is? OK, I'll tell you. I've just having a little bit of trouble figuring out why a guy like you would just suddenly turn on everything you stood for. Carter, how much time you ever spend in prison? OK. I spent eight years in the Mekong Delta wondering if each day was going to be my last. And I'll be damned if I want to spend my last 25 wondering the same thing. You know I'm curious, Carter. That bullet you shot me with. Was it a hand load? What difference does that make? Maybe a lot. Tells me what kind of man you are. It was a .308 match. 168 grain bowtail hollow point, sitting on top of 46.2 grains of powder. You loaded it? No, the ammo company did. See, unlike you, I'm only into guns because it's my job, OK? A tool. I get no pleasure from them. Bullshit. Takes a lot of range time to get as good as you are, buddy. You spend a lot of time with that rifle. And I think there's a part of you that likes being able to take a man out at 300 meters. But for me, it's not the guns I love. It's just-- it's just the principle. I think people should have the right to defend themselves and their families. OK, but unless you're living in Sarajevo, that does not require automatic weapons. You guys got 'em. And that is my exact point, OK? You guys acquire them with every single intention of using them against the authorities. You people break into people's homes in the dead of night wearing a black mask. When I was growing up, only the bad guys did that. Not the cops. All right, well, go ahead and fill it up. I'll go inside and see what's happening. Don't talk to strangers. Asshole. Shit. Do I know you? I don't think so. You sure look familiar. People tell me that all the time. I guess I've just got one of those faces, you know? [traffic passing] Guess it was my mistake. Sorry to trouble you. - Ah, no. No bother at all. Have a good one. He recognized you, didn't he? He said I looked familiar. That's not so good. Who is he? He's an old friend of mine. One of the guys you missed in Colorado. His name's Tom Jeffries. And right now, he's probably on his way to Needles. What's in Needles? Not a hell of a lot, usually. According to old Earl in there, there's a meeting happening. Most of the brotherhood will be there. What the hell is she doing here? I'll let you know in a minute. Goddammit. You mind telling me what it is you're doing here? How about my job, for starters? What, did they teach you this in field training 101? "How to blow your agent's cover in one easy step." Look, Carter. Anderson made me your chaperone. Get used to it. I'm not going anywhere. Now excuse me, I'd like to use the ladies' room. Just keep your distance, OK? [engine turning over] Goddamnit. MONTGOMERY: Well, chalk up one for our side, folks. Today the police state did something that surprised even a jaded old son of a bitch like myself. They admitted they done wrong. Yes, sir. Hard as it is to believe, yesterday a federal appeals court overturned the conviction of William Fain. So as of today, he's a free man. A hero is back among us, patriots. See, I told you. MONTGOMERY: Yes, you can bet we'll be hearing from him soon. We have a good chance of getting him right here on this show, just as sure as 10 dimes buys a buck. Hello, Bobbi. William Fain, you're a sight for sore eyes. How you been, man? Good. Dad, is that him? There. How about a cold one? Yeah. Hey. Name's Billy Joe Stephens, and I'd be honored to buy you that beer, Mr. Fain. - Thanks. Billy Joe, this one's on the house. And all the rest of them after that. Thanks. I'm much obliged. It's an honor to be back among friends. [inaudible] So what's your ugly friend having? Beer, please. Name's Ethan. Edwards. Hey Ethan, I'm Bobbi. Any friend of William Fain is welcome here any time. Hey Tom, you're not going to say hello? I was getting to it. Hey, buddy. Hey, I heard this morning. Crazy dog. Yeah, yeah. Say, meet my friend Ethan. You know, I believe I did. Mr. Fain, I'd sure like you to meet son Doug. All right, sure. Doug. William Fain. How do you do, Doug? Yo, Mr. Fain. I've heard a lot about you. It's a pleasure to have you back home, sir. Thank you. It's good to be back. You know, I've always held you up as an example for him to follow. I sure hope I can live up to it. Oh, this is my pal Ethan. - How you guys doing? - Ethan. Ethan. Listen, there's a gun show over in Bear Skin tomorrow. Yeah? You find my table, I'll fix you up with something special. And don't worry about no background check, OK? I know you just as well as I need to. Thanks, Billy Joe. I appreciate that. [laughing] Boy, I bet some heads are going to roll over at the ATF, huh? [laughing] Yeah. Listen, why don't they just shit can that whole operation? But those sons of bitches on unemployment, huh? I tell you what, I'd like to see them slabbed out. Just line them all up against the wall, and let it go. Amen, huh? - There you go. Amen. I'm going to get a tequila. Anyone want anything? Yeah, get me a shot of whiskey, will ya? All right. Yeah, I'll take one. That's my That's my buddy Ethan. He's from East Fort Worth. That where you met him? Mm-hmm. Hey. Couple more beers? No, actually. Can I get a shot of tequila and a whiskey, please? Yeah. So you worked here long? Since I was a size eight. So where do you know him from? You one of the Montana boys? No, I'm-- I'm from, uh-- He's from Texas. You'll have to forgive him. He's a little slow. Especially when it comes to giving his old buddy a whiskey. You'll have to excuse me. I was being charmed by the wiles of the lovely lady here. Yeah, well who wouldn't? But hey, she ain't no lady. All right, William Fain. You might be everybody else's hero in here, but they can watch me throw your ass out the front door in about five seconds, OK? She will, too. Do you have a bathroom here? Yeah, all the way back there. Over on the left. Thank you. Start with me. Come in here and start with me. We boring you? No, no. Beer just ran right through me. You just need some fresh air, Carter. Yeah. Let me refresh your memory. I was up on that mountain too, you ATF piece of shit. Let's go. I don't know what the hell's going on since you killed his family, but I'm sure as hell going to find out. You got it wrong. ATF kicked me out. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Excessive use of force! [gun shot] What the hell was that? Get out of here! Go, go! Not again. Hey, bastard just shot Tom Jeffries. Come on, we can still catch him. Come on! Come on, Fain! [car engine revving] [tires squealing] Man, you can sure think on your feet. I'll give you that. I'm glad your friends aren't so smart. Smart enough! Get a little closer, come on. [gun shots] Shit! Fucking die! Come on, Dad. Get it closer. Jesus! Jump! - What? - Jump! You're kidding! They dead? What do you think, Doug? Get in the truck, Doug. Shit. Man, I'm getting too old for this shit. Jumping out of trucks. This is fucking beautiful. Well, that's it. Blown. Might as well be wearing big old hats on our heads that say ATF. Almost like you planned it this way. Come on. I want to stop them just as much as you do. Oh yeah? Why? Why, when they believe the exact same stupid bullshit that you believe? - No they don't. They're different. They're fucking terrorists, man. You guys are all terrorists as far as I'm concerned, man. Every fucking one of you. Don't say that because it's not true. You don't know what terror is until you see your son being shot at by some son of a bitch in a government helicopter. Your son, your wife, your followers. All those people are dead because of you and your stupid goddamn beliefs. That's why they're dead. They're not dead! What? I said they're not dead. Anderson came to me and said, "What will it take to get you to work with the feds?" I said, "Only one thing. I want my wife and son back. But you can't give me that. And he said, "What if I can?" He said, "We faked their deaths. That's why we blew up the compound." What the fuck are you talking about? My wife made a deal with him just before the raid. Me for her and the kid. So if I work with you now, I get them back. That's why we got to keep going, pal. Now come on. [phone ringing] [beeping] Yeah. Are you all right? Oh, yeah, yeah. We're doing just fine. We're having a little barbecue here over at Vasquez Canyon. Let me ask you a question. Why didn't you just walk into the bar, whip out your gun and blow a hole in the jukebox and scream, "Hey! These guys are ATF!" Yeah, well I guess I was so busy saving your life I just couldn't get the initials out. Let me ask you another question. Fain's wife and kid. Are they still alive? Hello? Bad connection? Yeah, they're still alive. Look, Anderson wants to pull the both of you out. He says it's getting too risky. Fuck him. You want me to tell him that you said that? Yeah. Tell him that. We're not even close to finished yet. Good. Let's go. MONTGOMERY: Item. Security preparations for the upcoming World Terrorism Summit began in earnest today with the Praetorian Guard. Oops, I meant the Secret Service, sending an advance team to Los Angeles. Folks, on July fourth, our beloved president and his NATO lackeys will announce the formation of a new multinational anti-terrorism force. For those of you who didn't catch that, I'll say it again. Foreign troops, folks. Right here on American soil. I mean, to them I guess the Constitution is just a guide. I mean, who has to pay attention to insignificant little details like the Second Amendment or the fourth? And after all, who needs warrants? I mean, they take so much time and effort. Why not just let the police go out and arrest anybody they want to? But let's get back to the case at hand, folks. The United Nations is using foreign troops to take over our nation and impose their new world order, bought and paid for by the US Congress. So folks, I strongly suggest you take a good, long look at your Congressman. Remember his face, because one day you may have to blow it off. This is George Armstrong Montgomery. We'll be right back after this. The homing devices are in place, but those missiles can't lock into the target if the Pentagon Air Defense Shield is in operation during the conference. I told you, our friend at the Pentagon is getting the disks. Good. What's the status? We've already loaded the anthrax into the booster clusters. So tomorrow we get to play with rockets. How many? They're expected. I'll go. Jackpot. Any ideas how to get inside? Sure. How about we walk in the front door? Son of a bitch. Drop your weapon, Carter. Right now! Staley! Well, the legend himself. Let's not get hysterical. You've had a full day. I brought you a present. Say hello to Agent Ethan Carter of the ATF. I said I'd get you inside, didn't I? MONTGOMERY: Patriots, you have heard the distant thunder. You have smelt the foul wind of the new world order. The day of reckoning is at hand. That's right, folks. In one way or another, the end is at hand. I have good news. I just received word that William Fain will be appearing on this show, maybe as soon as tomorrow. Until then, as the folks in New Hampshire like to say, live free or die. Well, well, well. Welcome back to the fight, William. Welcome back to the brotherhood. Good to be here, George. Good to see you. You know, things have changed a lot around here since you left. Oh, I know. Agent Carter, I hear that you're a longtime fan. Longtime listener. It's not the same thing. Really? I'm crushed. Lock him in the guest room. And you boys get some sleep. We've got a lot of work to do tomorrow. You must be hungry. - I am. I am, George. [honking] Good morning. Good morning. I'm sorry, the tour doesn't start until 10. Yeah, I know. Sorry. I tried to call, but reception is for shit up here. Hey look, we're scouting for a movie. Thought this might make a good location. Hang on a second. I'll be right down. Hey. - How you doing? - Good, thanks. I'm Gil Allen. This is my producer, Frank Ritter. How are you doing? Colonel Jim Donnerman, US Army, retired. What kind of a movie are you doing here? It's not porno or anything like that, is it? No, no. It's an action film. Action? I love action movies. Come on. Who's in it? Well, you know we haven't really set the cast yet. We're talking to some big names. Anyway, we thought you could show us around a bit. Absolutely. And listen. If you need any extras, or maybe you've got a small part? I've got my Screen Actors Guild card here. Yes, you do. You know, that could be very possible. Well, just keep me in mind. That's all. Come on, I'll give you the nickel tour. It's your lucky day, bud. Mr. Montgomery figures he can use you, so you get to live a while. You're a real piece of work, Fain. You think so? Yeah. All that bullshit you were spouting about your family and wanting to get them back. You're a hell of an actor. I bought it. My wife betrayed me. She betrayed everything I stood for. Seems to run in your family, doesn't it? Oh, don't forget. You've got that nice little chip in your hand. They know where you are at all times. Yeah, and don't you forget we're here to infiltrate a militia. They'll wait a long time before intervening, otherwise they lose all hope of getting the anthrax back. Oh, and by the way, Mr. Montgomery requests your presence for supper. And it ain't optional. Have a good day. Officially, this is Nike missile air defense base number LA-78. De-activated in 1974. The Nike missile was designed to deliver a warhead up the butt end of a Ruski bomber at 3.65 times the speed of sound. Come on in, I want to show you something. Gentlemen, the Nike 6387. That's impressive. That's impressive. Can you fire this whole thing? Absolutely. In fact, South Korea and Greece still use them. All you need's an engine up the ass end there, and a warhead to put in the nose cone. And a 10 man crew plus me. I bet you don't need your SAG card for that. No sir, I don't. People in this country don't give a damn about politics. You can't get 25% of the population to vote, let alone start a revolution. Militiamen were very few in 1776. Most of the colonists were content to just stay in their homes, live their lives. Pay their taxes. Exactly. It took terrorism and reprisals and bloodshed before the people would fight back. But they did. And they'll do it again. I could've stayed home and listened to your radio broadcast there, Monty. Carter, this is not about ratings. It's not about speeches. This is about an eye for an eye. Blood for blood. So you're going to go and you're gonna kill federal agents because you believe that little black helicopters are coming to get you? Or that the evil ATF is going to come into your house at night while you're sleeping and steal your guns? Do you really believe that shit? Hey. You were at Ruby Ridge and you were at Waco. A lot of Americans died that day. Many of them were children. And then your agency tried to cover their ass by lying about it. That must've made you feel real proud. Don't tell me you slept well that night. I have my reasons, and I intend to see my purpose through. And I suggest that it's time for both of you to see just how. Gentlemen? Gentlemen. We under the pool now? I had it double-lined with lead so it won't leak. Ah. Tomorrow morning, the President of the United States joins NATO and other world leaders in Los Angeles. Though I will not be attending the event myself, as a member of the media, I will send a representative. Anthrax warheads. Within 48 hours, everybody attending that event will be dead. Half the population of Los Angeles will follow them to hell before wind conditions render the air safe again. Who will get the blame for that, George? Well, who cares? Foreign nationals, the red Chinese. It's not about blame. It's about what our federal government will do after the attack. The feds will force a crackdown. You can bet on that. That's right. On all personal freedoms. We are going to see guns outlawed. We'll see curfews. We'll see martial law. UN troops will be brought in to battle armed resistance. Every conspiracy freak's dream come true. My dream, Agent Carter. Seeds of a new American Revolution have been sown. Americans are going to rise up by the millions, and I'm going to be the man to lead them. So where do I fit into your paranoid little fantasy? Your body will be found with evidence implicating you in an ATF scheme to assassinate me. That's real good. About as good as can be expected, anyway. Well, it's a little footnote to the entire story, which should increase my popularity with the great unwashed. My ratings should be phenomenal. Sir. Staley's ready to make his move, and the chopper's on the way. Countdown to a new America. Hello? Anybody there? Hello? What's going on? Didn't you get my fax, colonel? No. We start shooting tomorrow. The movie? No. Your missiles. It wasn't until I saw her naked that I realized she was a big girl. She was big. She was real upset, wasn't she? Oh. Looks like we have some visitors. Excuse me. Sir. Evening, Major. Take a seat. After you. So colonel, how are my boys doing? Not as fast as your crews were, I bet. Doesn't matter anyway. You might get these things launched, but you can't aim them. Not without guidance. Ah, see, now that's what we wanted to talk to you about. I've studied all the manuals, but I still had a few specific questions about the radar tracking system. I think you're up shit creek, pal. And I got the paddle. I don't think so, colonel. And you will help us. You can't be serious. This stuff is over 30 years old. I've always been partial to antiques myself. You know, I don't know if I can remember how to work all this stuff. I'd start remembering, colonel, because we can still launch those missiles with or without guidance. Who knows what they might hit. Nice, quiet neighborhood filled with children. A school. The possibilities are endless. What the hell is that? What the hell is that sound? It's a microwave emergency signal. Fail safe in case of system shut down. It has its own power supply. I can't shut it off. Take a fucking hammer to the thing! And this is where everything happens. Major Wilson, Agent Carter. I thought you might like to see how this thing works. Montgomery, just give me my money and let me get in the air. I've done my part. I just want to be out of the country before your little party gets started, OK? This is the part where he shoots you, Major. Nonsense. I'm a man of honor, Carter. Of course, that's something you wouldn't understand. Pike, would you kindly escort Major Wilson to our helicopter, and tell the pilot to take him any place he wants. Pleasure. I told you not to fuck with me, didn't I Carter? Now. Now you're not so goddamn cocky, are you? So what did you get out of the deal, Monty? NORAD missile defense codes. Thanks to Major Wilson, we can target our missiles to any coordinates we want, including the Continental Hotel where the President will be giving his speech at 0800 hours. Yes, as the local rednecks like to say, you want to kill some chickens you better get inside the hen house. Where to? Don't worry about it. Just get in the air. What have you got? The California office just received a call from the Coast Guard. They've picked up some sort of repeating emergency signal on an old military frequency. It's originating from an abandoned missile base. You think it's Carter? I hope so. It repeated for almost two hours. You tell him to have the assault team standing by, and we'll meet him in what, 30 minutes? You get us a chopper. So how long were you in for? Just shut up and get me to Negalas. If you don't mind, I'd prefer Ensenada. I hear it's very nice this time of year. Why am I not surprised? How much money do you want? That ain't the point, Major. This isn't about money. It's about innocent lives. I was afraid of that. Mayday, mayday, mayday! Where is he? Where is he? - Where's who? [door closing] That's Anderson, Gerald Anderson. Want me to spell it? RADIO: No, I have it, sir. Tell him to bring plenty of men and equipment. And make sure he gets that. Over. RADIO: Roger flight two niner. Can you give me your ID? Fain. William Fain. I'm with the ATF. Will it fit? Of course. You worried? No, but-- Hey, relax. 30 years ago army crews did this 24 hours a day. Not with anthrax. How long? Give me a half. Sir, Staley's on the link at the launch site. The missile is in launch position 30 minutes from mark. Good. Happy fourth of July. If Fain got away, you're blown, Monty. Could be. Maybe he just didn't have the stomach for this. Well I can tell you this. Nothing is going to stop those missiles except an alteration of the launch code. Nelson, lock her in. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Let me begin today by saying that we face terrible enemies in this new world of ours. Bathroom break is over, colonel. You're needed on the set. Readying missiles one and two. ETA launch, 15 minutes. Missile 3 in position. ANNOUNCER: Arm warhead. Warheads armed and ready to go. MONTGOMERY: Disengage tactical defense shields. MAN: Shields disengaged. Activate homing beacons. MAN: Beacons activated. Those missiles will ride Staley's beams right down to the middle of that conference. Our common enemies respect neither borders nor human life. Thank god for NATO countries fighting together side by side, crushing terrorism wherever it raises its head. You hear that? I'll check. [rumbling] All right, they're here. Wake up and stay alert. We are under attack. I repeat, we are under attack. Stand firm, Staley. 10 minutes counting. Missile lock is good, and we have five bogeys moving in on the perimeter, sir. End of broadcast, Monty. You mean the cavalry's coming in for the rescue. Those missiles fly no matter what, my friend. [alarm sounding] Launch the fucking missiles. I can't. They're not ready. I'll have to go bypass the circuits. Well then go. Move it! I'll watch him. I'd say you're shit out of luck. Oh, is that right, old man? Well you're coming with me. [gun shots] [screaming] Move in. Go, go, go, go! MAN: Five minutes. Activate final ignition. Ignition activated. The United States, the United Nations, and the entire world-- pardon me, ladies and gentlemen. [rumbling] What the hell was that? That should wake them up. Let's stop the missiles! OK, hold it right there. Hold it. Don't move or I'll kill the colonel. Hold your fire! All right. Now you've got two reasons to back out of here. Number one, I will put a bullet in his fucking head. And number two, you got about four minutes before this whole place goes ground zero. Now back out. Now! Back off. Back off! [screaming] [thumping] You five follow me. The rest of you guys out of here. We're losing time! [phone ringing] That was good. Let's do her again. Take care of the colonel! Can we override from here? I don't know. I'll try. RADIO: Herd to rogue. - This is rogue. Go ahead, Herd. Over. We've got about three minutes before these missiles launch. Can you abort from there? Negative. I want you to blow Montgomery's place. Nike missiles self destruct when they lose their guidance systems. It's our only chance. What about the warheads? Fired electronically. Self-destruct shouldn't trigger the anthrax. I sure hope those missiles read the manual. Let's taken down quick, Dale. You can't stop a revolution, Carter! There's less than three minutes to launch. OK, go. Go, go. Go. Come on. Go. If we're not back in two minutes, get the hell out of here! OK. Clear! [beeps] [beeps] Less than two minutes to launch, Carter. Carter. There's no way out. This is for America, Carter. And so is this, George. It's over. Now drop that gun. Right now. Not until you pry it from my cold, dead hands. Have it your way. Come on, Carter. We've only got about a minute left! Wait no, I have to abort the launch code. Huh? You know the codes? I saw him type. - Oh, great. That makes me feel a lot better. What the hell are you talking about? - Ask Sanders. - Huh? Cross your fingers. Ah! Go! [laughing] Come on, move your ass! Come on. You got family waiting. Agent Sanders. Hey. Hey yourself. Nice job. You too. I heard you got some experience. So you're back to Washington? Yeah, first thing tomorrow. Tough being on the fast track, huh? I don't know if you noticed, but the wind is not blowing. Ah, yes. A day like this I could actually get down to 10% asshole. Wow! Maybe even five. Really? Go for a world record. You want to try? I'm buying. Yes, that would be wonderful. It is the least you can do, by the way, seeing as you have the cushy job. Oh, right. Cushy. Uh huh. - You sit behind a desk all day. Do my nails. Do your nails.
