Jennifer >> I thought I hadhis back but he didn't see it that way.I crossed some invisible line. I broke the kids' code. But, come on, the jerkwas stealing his lunch. And poor Flo. She's sucked intothis mean-girl-ville. It's so painful to watchbecause it... What? >> Am I supposed to beinterested in this? >> I don't know.Are you? >> You've changed. This whole temporary mom thing,you changed. >> It's just beenfor two weeks, Quinn. A person doesn't changein two weeks. >> You have. And I don't like it. >> I'm sorry. >> Now you sound like my sister. >> You hate your sister. >> Which is why thisis not interesting. >> You're right.It's not. >> Throw a hissy fit. >> How about that?Is that interesting? >> Hey!How was your night? >> Illuminating. How were the kids? >> Ah, Miles and Floare out for the count. And Alice rode into the sunsetwith James Dean. By the way, that guy is... >> Crazy, huh?I know. This is your fiance,even when he's snoring. >> Yeah.He'll be the father of my children with benefits. >> So you guys planon having kids? >> Absolutely. >> It's such a hugeresponsibility. Sarah >> Yeah, one a billionpeople can't wait to take on. >> When they wantto stop having fun. >> Taking on responsibilitydoesn't mean giving up joy, Jen. Sometimes it's a greatway to find it. >> Cops! Cops!Let's go! Let's go!We gotta go. Alice >> Sean, wait for me!Don't leave me. Sean! >> We had a deal, Alice. >> I know. I'm so sorry. >> One thing's for sure,no more Sean. >> It wasn't his fault. >> Did the cops grab him too? >> I don't think so.I think he got away. >> He abandoned you? >> It wasn't like that. >> Standup guys.We sure know how to pick him. >> Are you goingto tell Mom and Dad? >> You reallydisappointed me, Alice. Big time. >> You sound like Mom. >> Obviously I'm not Mandybecause you never would have pulled a stuntlike this with her. >> Hey. Is the prodigal niecehome safe and sound? >> Yeah. I can't thank you enough forstaying with Flo and Miles. I didn't know who else to call. >> Oh, it's fine.They slept right through. >> Good.Thanks. Excuse me. >> Oh... >> Hey. >> I've made a messof everything. >> Oh. >> Miles isn't speaking to me. Flo is in an emotionalfree fall. And Alice ends upin the police station. >> You know, growing up, thatwas a typical day in my house. >> What was I thinking,with that girl? An older boy, a motorcycle. Of course, she was goingto get herself into trouble. I was acting like her BFF andI should have been her aunt. I can't do this anymore. I'm going to call Mandy,she needs to come home. >> So what, you're just,you're just going to quit? >> I'm not quitting.I'm being realistic. I'm in way over my head. >> Yes, you are on the upwardarc of your learning curve. And I wouldn't get myhopes up for winning any "Temporary Mother of the Year"awards. But I wasn't kidding. You know, me and my brother andmy sister, when we were kids, we were always melting downand messing up and it's what kids do. >> I bet you had a momwho knew how to deal. >> Yeah, but I think that'sthe operative word, "deal". I really think that she justmade it up as she went along. You know, relying on commonsense and a good heart. That's what parents do. And maybe I am wrong butI think you can do it too. Come on.You've got chops, girl. >> Oh.>> You were All-city. >> I'll give you a minute.Okay? >> Uh huh. >> Smells good. Will >> Oh, I figuredyou'd be too tired to make breakfastfor the kids so. >> Quiche, kids,I don't know about that. >> Ah, just tell themit's a ham and cheese pie. They'll love it. I should go.I probably shouldn't be here when they wake up.Too much to explain. You should get some sleep. >> I'm not a quitter, Will. >> I hope not.It'd be a real bummer to interrupt Brianand Mandy's trip. I'll tell you what though,if you do stick around, I can make dinner foryou guys on Thursday. >> Okay.>> All right. Jennifer >> Thank you. For tonight. >> Yeah, anytime. >> I am not a quitter. You think you're uglyand stupid? Does that girl lookugly and stupid? >> Kinda. >> Kinda?>> Okay, a lot. >> Well she wasn't. She was just growing up. Trying to figure out who she wasand how she fit in. Eventually she found out. >> Was she a friend of yours? >> That's me. >> But you're, like,the coolest person I know. >> I thought Erika was? >> Coolest old person. >> Well, I don'tknow about that. But I'm me. And, once I figured out who"Me" was, then I figured out how I wanted to dressand talk and act. We're always growing intowho we really are, Flo. And I'm telling you,as a very objective aunt, you are amazing. >> If we're always growing, thenhow come you'll never grow up? >> Actually, I think I am. >> Can I have thatcellphone back now? >> I thought you'd never ask. >> Wow. Awesome ham and cheese pie,Aunt J. >> Okay. I shouldn't have grabbed,what's his name? >> Toby. >> I shouldn't have grabbedToby and tried to take him to principal.I'm sorry. But you're only a wimpif you let yourself be. Toby's a bully and bulliesseem tough but they're not. And, I have a pretty solid ideaof how to deal with Toby. If you're interested,let me know. >> I'm interested. Here's my lunch, Toby.I made it special for you. Toby >> Ew! >> Ah, viva Roma! >> Ah.>> That was the best day ever. >> Yeah, just about.>> Just about? >> I miss the kids. >> Mm. Brian >> Hmm.Both >> Hmm. >> I'm not going to tellyour mom and dad about the other night.>> Oh, thank you. >> You are. They need to know, especiallyyour mom because she was right. Sean is too old for you.And you got into trouble because you were asking for it. You should have listened to her. She deserves to hearthat from you. Kathryn >> Hi, sweetheart.Just checking in. Jennifer >> Hi, Mom.How's Dad doing? >> Oh, he's a little better. And how about you?Hm? You managing okay still? >> Oh, a few broken heartsand rules here and there but no broken bones. We're muddling through. >> Well, of course you are.After all, it's not astrophysics, is it?>> You're right. It's a million times harder. I don't know how you've doneit for so long, and Mandy. >> Well, a lot of women do. >> With such grace and humour. You're really a greatmom, you know that? >> Well, I love being a mom. It's, it's brought mea lot of joy. >> Well, I've got to getFlo to soccer. >> Oh.Jennifer >> But thanks for calling, Mom. Thanks for everything. >> You're welcome, sweetheart. Jennifer >> I'll talkto you soon, Mom. >> Okay. >> You okay? >> Yeah. How's your hip?>> My hip's great. >> Good enough to fly? >> I'm on it. Flo >> Wow, we havea lot of groceries. Miles >> I'll get the big bag.Will >> Come on, come on. Alice >> Did you getthe cranberries? Jennifer >> Theywere on the list. Will >> All right,what have you got? >> Surprise! >> Mom? >> Hi! >> Dad, hi.How is your hip? >> Good.Much better. >> Okay.Oh, Will. Mom, Dad, this is Will.>> Oh, hi. Kathryn.>> Great to meet you. Jennifer >> He's, ah,making dinner for us. Will >> Yes, I knew there was areason we had so many groceries. Um, you know, why don't I takethis stuff in the kitchen. Jennifer >> Oh, thank you.>> Yeah, no problem. You guys can, ah, catch up. Kathryn >> I'd love to try that. >> Now look, you canread those but if you commit them to memory,I will have to kill you. Chef's code. Hey. Mandy >> Hi, honeys...Both >> We're home! Brian >> Hello? Kids >> Mom, Dad! Miles >> Dad!Brian >> Buddy! >> Daddy!What are you doing here? >> I hope nobody wants seconds. >> Paris, it's likeromance is in its DNA. >> I felt exactly thesame way when I was there. >> Oh, Jennifer, your shoes. You have to tell mewhere you got them. >> A few days ago,Dad was bedridden and in too much pain to travel. Now he's playing football? >> How is that possible? Okay, Mom.Let's hear it. Seriously, what did you do? >> Okay. There was no fallin the bathroom. His hip is fine. Just a little socialengineering, mom style. Mandy >> Hmm.>> Okay, sit down. Sit, both of you. Jennifer, you're my baby. And probably because I'vealways treated you as such, you've been a little slowin the growing up department. >> Oh, come on.Kathryn >> Well you have. And nothing grows you up quickerthan taking care of kids. >> Huh.>> And you, my dear, you grew up too fast. You needed a little time to, just to be a young womanin love again. Mandy >> What, you didn't haveto socially engineer that. I mean, it would havehappened on its own. I still have somehormones left. >> Would it?I don't know. You see, you're lucky, like me.You married a terrific guy. Someone who'll do almostanything you ask. But I knew that Brian wouldn't get the kind of honeymoonthat he'd dreamed about. The kind that you both needed. Unless I forced the issue. >> What are you talking about? >> Okay. When you thought that Jenniferwas going to have to look after the kids for another two weeks,you wanted to hop on a plane and fly right home, didn't you? >> Well, yeah.>> Yeah. And then Brian, for one ofthe few times in his life, put his foot down, didn't he? >> What are you, clairvoyant? >> When it comes to you two?Yes. Oh, come on, gals. It was a once ina lifetime opportunity. Are you going to begrudge yourgrey-haired mom a little fun? >> Your hair's not that grey.>> Oh, if only you knew. Mandy >> You know, life is nota practical joke, Mom. >> Did you have that honeymoon? >> Yes.Kathryn >> Yes. And did you like takingcare of those kids? >> Yeah. >> Okay.I'm sorry. >> You were goingto jump on a plane. Kathryn >> Oh, wait.Just, just a sec. There was a third reason. Just like she'll always bemy baby, she'll always be your "Little sister" but, but she's, she's allgrown up now. And you need to see that. Oh! Oh! >> You know, Mom, there is sucha thing as being too wise. >> Dinner was unbelievable. I think my Mom would killto get those recipes. >> Thanks. It's, ah, years of practice. So now that Brianand Mandy are back, I guess you'll be heading home? >> If I want to sleep in a bed. >> Well it's been greathaving you as a neighbour. >> You too. >> Um, take care of yourself. Jennifer >> Tomorrow'sa pretty typical Friday. Flo has the ortho appointmentso it's a half-practice. Miles is in that concertnext weekend so be sure that he brings the rightmusic to his lesson. >> Okay, I haven'tbeen gone that long. I do know how to do this.>> Right, sorry. >> And obviously, so do you.You know, Mom's right. I do think of you as a kid. No, I did. I totally underestimatedyou, and I apologize. >> Do didn't underestimateme at all. And, if I'm even a tenthas good as mom as you are, I got there kickingand screaming. >> Well, whatever the process,you really stepped up >> Likewise. >> I'll see you tomorrow.>> Yeah. >> Mom, can I talk to you? >> Yeah. What's up, baby? >> Knock knock. >> Hey, Jennifer.How are you? >> I'm good.Actually, no, I'm not good. >> Well, sit down, have a seat. >> You offered mesomething fantastic and I was afraid to take it. So I don't blame you forreplacing me with the temp. But I just want you to knowthat I am not afraid anymore. I am ready to take onthat responsibility. I took care of three kidsfor three weeks and no one thought I coulddo it, not even I thought I could do it.But I did it. And it taught me thatI can do anything. Especially when it'simportant to me and this job is important to me. It fills me with so much joy. So, if things don't work outwith the other guy, I... >> Jennifer.>> Really hope that you'll reconsider and...>> Jennifer! I didn't hire the temp.He's still is just a temp. >> Oh. >> Of course I wantto have you as my partner. I couldn't think of anythingI'd like better. >> Wow!>> Yeah. >> That's... Wow! >> Welcome back. Jennifer >> You know how whensomeone's humming a song and they stop before the last noteand it drives you crazy all night because it's, like,unfinished business? >> I hate when that happens. >> I couldn't sleepat all last night. There. So, maybe we couldgrab some dinner. A movie. >> I thought youhad a boyfriend? >> I did, have a boyfriend. I'm a quitter, remember? Will >> Well I'd say "Yes." But only after you'vehumiliated me on the boards. >> You are on. Miles >> Wow, that'sa cool clock! Brian >> And this is howthey do their laundry. Brian >> Oh, and here'sthe Roman Forum. Mandy >> Come on in, quick. >> Um, before we start this...Mandy >> Uh huh. >> I have a proposal.Date night. Just the two of you,once a week, and I can hang with the kids.Flo >> Awesome! >> Is there anything aboutthat proposal you don't like? >> Not a thing. Flo and Miles >> Ew!Mandy >> Ah... >> Are we going to do this?Miles >> Yeah, totally. >> Okay, let's seesome travel pics. >> Oh, no, we've gotsomething better than that. >> Courtesy of Flo.Kathryn >> Yeah. Okay.Flo >> Here we go. >> You're going to makeyour mom cry.
