(CARS HONKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Son of a bitch! (GRUNTING) (GUN FIRING) Yeah! (SCREAMING) Yeah! (POLICE SIREN BLARING) (SCREAMING) Oh! (CHURCH BELLS RINGING) (GRUNTS) Oh! Sunday school's over! (GRUNTS) (GROWLS) Yah! (GRUNTING) (SHRIEKING) You need any help, Sis? No, you take this guy. I got the other one. (NUN SHRIEKING) (NUN SHRIEKING) (MAN GRUNTING) BILLY: According to our research, it shows a 76% stimulus response, 66% leadership factor, and an 85% percent demographic viewability quotient. What the fuck does that mean? It is the highest-tested show in the history of the network. All right, I just got one question. If I allow a show about a macho nun on my network, am I gonna have the church on my ass? We could have some affiliate trouble in the south and in Utah. I can't have affiliate trouble. You see, I... You gotta have affiliates to win. Now, Billy, do we really need this show? Sir, like another man, I follow a simple path. I follow the path the numbers tell me to take. They speak to me. And I respond to what they say, what they mean. It's all right there. Unless the good Lord changes the rules of the game, the data dictates what is acceptable, and what is not. Excuse me, but that doesn't answer the question. What if your numbers are wrong? Yeah, Billy, I mean... (CHUCKLES) What if the numbers are wrong? The numbers are never wrong. (CHUCKLES) That's right. (LAUGHING) Nine years ago, when I bought this network, they said, "He owns used cars, shipyards, horses. "What does he know about broadcasting?" Well, all I know is that for the past nine consecutive years, this network has been number one. And this year, we have a chance to do what no other network has ever done. That's be number one for the tenth consecutive year! Thank you. Thank you. That's why I am proud as hell to present our new fall schedule. First, "Daddy Does Dope." "Cleveland." The buckeye soap opera. And this action adventure series, "Kicking the Habit." (CHUCKLING) "MALIBU O-B-G-Y-N." The human drama. And finally the interracial sitcom entitled, "Thirty Love My Serb." Now I ask you, is that a schedule designed merely to get numbers? Or is that a schedule designed to enlighten and educate the people of America? Excuse me, George, but isn't it true that just last week you were quoted as saying, "I like to see the American people eat shit"? That remark was taken totally out of context. Weren't you also quoted as saying, "I want that record and I don't care who I gotta fuck to get it"? I never said that. And we can prove he wasn't there when he did. REPORTERS: Oh, please! Now... (STUTTERS) I'm shocked at these allegations. Shocked. These are attempts to discredit us by the doomsayers, the, the subversives, and other Democrats. (REPORTERS GROAN) And with that, I pledge to you that this will be the most amazing season in the history of television. (REPORTERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. STUART: This is a Fielding box. Yes, this little handy, dandy device might seem simple and small, yet to some it may be the most feared machine in the world. How come? It produces the television ratings. Correct! Give that lady a husband! (LAUGHING) Yes, the infamous Fielding ratings. The process that determines who watches what, and where and when they watch it. WOMAN: What about "Why"? What about it? WOMAN: What happened to "Why"? Why they watch it? Yeah. That's for the networks to decide. I'm afraid that's not my responsibility. If it were, I guess I'd be in charge of programming and they'd be giving tours. (LAUGHING) Now, if you follow me. And you! That's how the Fielding families are selected? That's it. Totally at random. Not very scientific. A categorized formula based on a digital income bracketing would be much better. Stupid. Digital is not scientifically acceptable. Right, Mr. Sain? Uh, sure. See? Told ya. GIRL: And how are the boxes distributed to the families? (INDISTINCT) Mr. Sain, how are the boxes distributed? According to population. One box for each 100,000 people in a designated area. This way, please. (INDISTINCT) STUART: Each box is checked, double checked, even triple checked for accuracy. Here at Fielding, nobody wants any mistakes. STUART: It records constantly, even when the set is off. But when it's on, the box picks up the station that it's tuned into, and transmits it by special telephone wires to this. COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) New Haven, Connecticut. Two, four, seven reporting. CNN. The most accurate computer in the world. We at Fielding refer to it as the "Mother ship." That's it! That's how the system works here at Fielding. Top of the line, state of the art technology. Except for three times a year, when the families are required to fill out these diaries by hand. This is known as... Sweeps week! (STUTTERS) I read TV Guide. (ALL LAUGHING) That's okay. So do a lot of other people. The meters are then boxed, and carefully loaded onto a fleet of Fielding trucks. Where they will be taken to their various destinations... Hey, careful! Careful with these things! Once the meters arrive at their various destinations... (TIRES SCREECHING) DRIVER 1: Look out! (CLATTERING) DRIVER 1: Hey! Who you callin' a son of a bitch? DRIVER 2: You dickhead, you nearly killed me! DRIVER 1: Kiss my ass! DRIVER 2: Kiss your ass? I'll kick your ass! (BOXES WHIRRING) (DRIVERS ARGUING INDISTINCTLY) The meters will then be installed by our various friendly Fielding reps. Please follow me. Come this way. (ENGINE ROARS) (ARGUING CONTINUES) (BOXES WHIRRING) Stuart, you're a real asshole. Damnit, Sain, be reasonable. It's not the truth, and you know it. Teams do it all the time. Not my team. You are so fucking straight. Thank you. Guys, guys, let me talk to him, okay? Stuart... Leon, don't pull rank on me now. I'm the captain of the softball team. I'm the one who puts the schedule together. And everybody appreciates that. Fine. Then why, as we are about to go into the playoffs, do you suddenly want to add this ringer to our roster? (CHUCKLES) A ringer? Carter's not a ringer. The guy works here. Two months. The season started before he got here. Now, you know the rules. And if Carter plays under my name, who's gonna know? I'll know. And I'll know, too. And so will the guys on the team. And guess what, no one else cares. Except me. Except you. Damnit, Stuart! Where is it written that everybody has to know everything? Does the Pentagon reveal all their weapons? No. Did you know when your parents made love? No, I didn't know when my parents made love. I didn't want to know. It's disgusting to even think about. This is not the same thing. All right, Stuart, look. You're my partner right? Think about this... Now both you and Carter are up for the same promotion as director. You don't want it to seem like you're prejudiced against the guy. These guys have a different agenda. Everybody wants to be number one. To get along, you go along. Okay, everybody gather around. Let's settle this thing for once and for all. Come on, come on. Okay, the question is whether we knowingly allow Peter Carter, who just happens to be an all-city first baseman, to play in our team under an assumed name. He's right. Yeah, so? Well, there's a catch. By doing that, we have to cut a player who helped us when we needed him. Marv Harris. ALL: (GROANING) Is that what you want? Is that what you want? It sure as hell ain't what I want. I want to go out the same way we came in. We win as a team, we lose a team. Come on, are you with me? ALL: No! MAN: Welcome, man. You're in. MAN: All right, all right. MAN 2: Good to have you on. Can you believe not one person backed me up? Not one. I did the right thing. I did the proper thing, and what happened? I got reamed! Phoebe, I ask you, what is happening with our society? STUART: Is this what we've become? Is winning so important? Does everyone have to be number one? I mean, is everybody full of shit? Hi. Nice hat. Stuart. Hi, honey. Bye-bye. See you later. Hey, pick up after your dog! Good girl. CARY: Stuart, I can't believe the progress I'm making with this group. It's the best rehab group I've ever counseled. STUART: That's great honey. It's really wonderful when you work with highly motivated people. STUART: Don't I know it? CARY: My problem is I've been hearing rumors of budget cuts. STUART: Budget problems? New York City? STUART: (SARCASTICALLY) No! CARY: Yes! CARY: Thinking about maybe having a raffle or a bake sale. STUART: Bake sale? These guys? What are they gonna pay? Cash prize? Stuart, that's not funny. (LAUGHING) Oh, God! Look at this Limoges! This is the pattern of Limoges china I want someday. That's nice. Marlene says she knows a guy who can get it at 30% off. Marlene is the crack addict, right? Heroin. Angel, however, says he knows somebody who can have it fall off a truck. Angel's the crack addict, right? Methadone. Oh, maybe I should try methadone. Wonder if there's a methadone light. You're not paying any attention to me. I am too. You were just talking about a city in China named "Ling Moge." Limoges is china. Now what's going on? Nothing. Stuart, you are mumbling. I always know there's something wrong when you start mumbling. It's like living with Popeye. Oh, funny, very funny. My career's gone down the tubes and you're telling jokes... So you're still bummed out about today? Yeah, yeah, of course I am. Well, you told the truth. I'm proud of you. And then Leon reminds me of the political implications. Leon is a weasel. Yeah, but he's my weasel. And I'm going to need his help to get the supervisor promotion. Honey, Leon is not going to stick his neck out for you. Well, I should get it! I should get the promotion. I've been with the company for five years. Carter's been there two months. Besides, we could use the extra money. CARY: We're doing fine! We're doing okay. We will do what we always have done. We'll work hard, enjoy our lives together, and ask my parents for money. I don't like asking your parents for money. Oh, that's natural. They don't like you asking either. (FLUSHES TOILET) (SCREAMING) Plus I'm scared that I've plateaued. You mean this is as good as it's going to get? Oh, God. No, I'm serious. I used to be the kid, the up-and-comer, and now I'm seeing these 25, 26-year-olds, and... I'm feeling a little vulnerable. Poor baby. Feeling vulnerable, huh? (MUMBLING) Whoa, whoa. What you doing? (GIGGLES) Ow! It's cold! Feels like a little chubby to me. Cold, cold... No, I'm serious. I don't get it, I don't get it. I'm 38 years old. I mean, that's not ancient. I mean, they treat me like I'm Methuselah. Why do they think I'm so straight? RADIO ANNOUNCER: Classic Rock Radio, with the Everly Brothers.

If it wasn't for me, you would have gotten nowhere. You mean I got it? I didn't say that. I didn't get it? I didn't say that either. I just want you to appreciate the fact that I supported you. Sure. Listen, they want to give you a test. What kind of test? You are goin' on TV. I'm what? LEON: They're doing a special on a new TV season. They wanted someone to come in and speak about the Fielding boxes. Everybody worth a shit is out of town, so I suggested you. Thanks! LEON: Listen, this could make the difference all right? Now don't screw it up. Peace. CARY: Good news? Maybe. Maybe. (BOXES WHIRRING) MAN: Honey, where did you get this ham? I got it from Beagle's supermarket. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) It's great.

My name's Mr. Conrad and your family has been selected for a Fielding Family. Uh, Zachariah, this man wants us to be a Fielson Family. Fielding. A Fielding Family. Oh, my. A Fielding Family. Daddy. They're the people who rate the TV shows. Is that right? Uh, pretty close. I'm sorry, we're just plain folk. You'd be better off with someone else. Not at all. Not at all. No, we'd be proud to be one of your families. Mr. Fielding. Yessir, proud. Come on in. Come on in. How does this thing work? What we do is hook up this box to your television set. You don't need to do a thing. Everything is transmitted directly to the "mother ship" computer. You don't understand, my husband and I, we don't watch much television. That's okay, because... We will represent that small segment of the population that is more selective or, uh, actually reads. That's correct. My husband... He knows about such things, you know. He's a Doctor of Psychology. Really? You know, I minored in psychology. Wow, how impressive. Yeah. The basic thing to always remember... To be sure you don't change your viewing habits. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Don't change your viewing habits? Right. That would defeat the purpose. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Okay. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON TV) Is this like one of those mathematical surveys? Yes. (MAN BURPS) It, um, it reaches the lowest common denominator. Molly! Bring me another damn beer! Oh! Could you stay for dinner? (MAN BELCHES) I'm sorry, I... I must be going. Goodbye and good luck. ANNOUNCER: Coming up next, a panel discussion on the upcoming television season. Here on Public Broadcast Television. Oh, no! Educational shit. Whoa oh! Yeah. (LAUGHING) Whoo! Son of a bitch. All right, five, four, three, two... Okay, continuing our conversation now on the eve of the upcoming television season, with Rachel Rowen, the head of Public Broadcasting Television, Stuart Sain, representing the Fielding Corporation, and on the far end, the noted, acid-tongued media critic, Jackson Carp. Acid-tongued? Bob, you wound me. Well, in your case, Jackson, I'm sure it's only a flesh wound. Wow, Stuart looks great. Of course he looks great, he's my partner. Ms. Rowen, let me ask you the first question. You've just been appointed the new head of PBT. How do you plan to compete with the giant networks? I don't. Seriously. I am serious, Bob. The rewarding part of public broadcasting is that we don't have to try and reach the broadest possible audience so that we can charge higher rates for advertising. We're not interested in who's hot and who's not. We're only interested in providing creative, intelligent, and even occasionally entertaining programs of quality. We have higher objectives. Silly things like the future of our children. Conservation, saving our planet. Making broadcasting a learning tool. Instead of a spiraling competitive game for ratings. You're telling me that you have no interest in ratings? Did you ever pay anyone for ratings? Me personally? No. Well, neither has anyone else, but the networks. Well, that's one perspective, and I'm sure there are others including that of Mr. Sain. And we'll get it when we come back after this break. (SIGHS) Was that okay? I got... Oh, boy! You showed some passion... And I'll tell you that... Well, you know... Excuse me. Where you goin'? You gotta be back. We're only gone for a moment. I got time for a cigarette. Ninety seconds. You're doing great! I don't look nervous, do I? No! Partner! Honey, that's your second drink. Come on, come on. I'm fine! Of course he's fine. He's my partner, huh? Thanks a lot, man. Here's a little gift for later. Leon, are you crazy? You know what my wife will do if she sees this? Loosen up, bro. You know, you were a lot more fun when we used to get high together. Leon, take it back, take... We're ready for you. Kick ass, partner! It's really gonna help you out next time. Next time? What do you mean next time? I didn't get it. I didn't say that. I got it? No. They went with Carter. Look, we'll talk about it afterwards. You told me it was all going to hinge on tonight. Hey, they had a different agenda. What the hell does that mean? We need you now. Good luck, honey. You know, I went to the wall for him. Sure. Okay, we're back. CAMERA MAN: Yeah, he's all hooked up. (BELL RINGING) MAN: All right, we're back. Ready in five, four, three... Okay, we're back, and as we promised, we're going to turn to Stuart Sain. Mr. Sain. Son of a bitch. Mr. Sain? What? Mr. Sain, perhaps you'd like to tell us why we need your service? Hell if I know. What did he say? Well... Hey... Don't you have anything to say? Does anybody have anything to say? I'll tell you why. Well, please. Jump right in. That way the networks can sell commercial time. That's the only thing networks can sell. Everything else, they buy. You know, something that determines what 250 million people watch should have more than 1,200 people's input. In fact, the ratings are a farce. Say something, bro. Mr. Sain, would you like to respond to that? Why? He's got all the answers. Secondly, who are these families? JACKSON: Obviously they're not very smart. Look at what they watch. Art should raise the level up. Not down. And what about this "average person" theory? By giving an "average person" power, he's no longer an average person. Thirdly, there's the snowball effect. By saying something is number one, what do they watch? Number one. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) JACKSON: Even if it wasn't number one, it becomes number one. Besides, how accurate are these ratings? They say the margin of error that they allow is 3%. What if it's 10%? A 10% change could move a show from thirty-fifth to tenth. What if it's 25%? What if the damn thing's just broke? What if? What if, what if... I mean... If my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle. (CHUCKLES) Whoa! What the... All you guys do is criticize. All I hear about are agendas. What is happening to America? What about character? What about integrity? What happened to just fair play? Fair play? Character? That went out years ago. (SCOFFS) Not to me it didn't. I think you're very naive. And I think you are an asshole. (LAUGHING) No, he didn't. (NERVOUSLY) Hey, I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. BOB: At least you've accomplished one thing. Jackson, it's the first time I've seen you speechless. I will sit here and be insulted. I won't stand for it! Jackson, please. Come on. Oh, oh... Easy. Damnit! He's down, but not out. Jackson, please, come back. Come on. This is funny? (LAUGHING) What the hell are you doing? I couldn't stop him. I'm sorry I didn't mean to... It just... It just... (LAUGHING) Well, uh, how did I do? You sucked partner. HOMELESS MAN: Spare change? You blew it man. You lost your cool. You were great. You were passionate, you were sexy. You called the guy an asshole! Sorry that slipped. No, no. I'll tell you what slipped, partner. Your job just slipped. Oh, Leon, you're overreacting. Excuse me. Sorry, forgive me for interrupting, but I... Oh, I just wanted to introduce myself formally. I'm Rachel Rowen. Hi, Stuart Sain. My wife, Cary. Hello. Hi. I just have to tell you, that I found what you said in there very refreshing. I grew up in the '60s and I believe in fair play, too. Oh, thank you. Although, I guess I should have censored myself. Nonsense, no, I don't believe in censorship of any kind! Confidentially, the guy is an asshole. Thank you. Well, look, I'm putting together a new team for PBT. And, well, if they're crazy enough to give me the authority, I'm crazy enough to follow my hunches. You Interested? I beg your pardon? Uh, partner, maybe you should think this over a little. Why don't you come by my office and we can kick it around, discuss it? You're serious? Uh-huh! After all, we have been loyal to you. Well, I'll have to talk this over with my wife first. How soon can he start? (TELEPHONE RINGING) WOMAN: Good morning, PBT, may I help you? Good morning, PBT... MALE ANNOUNCER: Don't forget the blood drive Wednesday morning... FEMALE ANNOUNCER: The mothers against... Vegetarian luncheon will meet next Wednesday at 1:00. MALE ANNOUNCER: There will a public scarification by the performance artist, Figaro, Friday at 8:00. WOMAN: Good Morning, PBT... FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Please remember to recycle all biodegradable materials in the yellow bins. MALE ANNOUNCER: There will be a free screening of the movie, King Of Hearts, in the conference room, Tuesday night at 7:30. FEMALE ANNOUNCER: The exiled Latino...

FEMALE ANNOUNCER: All pledges for the civil disability dance-a-thon are due by next Friday. Okay, everyone. This is Stuart Sain. Hi. ALL: Hi. Stuart is going to be joining us in a public relations capacity. Although, I'm not quite sure what that position is yet. AMANDA: Join the club. (RACHEL LAUGHING) RACHEL: Anyway let's get down to business. What do you think of my new programming choices? (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Um... Counter-programming is one thing, but do you have to make our jobs tougher than they already are? I don't follow. Uh, what he means is that we still need underwriters. RACHEL: So? So when the networks open up with their biggest, most highly promoted shows... We present, "Spotted Whales, "Friends or Foes?" Or "Central America, "Beyond Murals." What is this? Here's my favorite. "The History of Limoges." AMANDA: It's killing me. Limoges china? Yeah. That's great. Well, at least one person thinks so. Please! Come on, Rachel! Get real! I am real. Come on, you guys! I think it's important that we make a statement. Yeah, and I'll tell you what that statement is. Boring! There you go! Okay, Stuart, do you think it's boring? Me? Mmm-hmm. What I think isn't important. You're the captain. And it's the captain's decision to make. And rather than second-guess it, I think we should rally around it. A good, positive, attitude takes you a long way. Well, thank you, Stuart. Now, if there are no other questions... Well, just one... What? Do you guys have a softball team? BILLY: Tomorrow our season begins. I want each of you in top physical condition. Fatigue makes cowards of us all. Now, let us join hands and ask His forgiveness. Dear Lord, grant us thy wisdom, and thy courage for our programming. Help us to reach, our potential objectives. To climb... Herbert, that man is honest to goodness, 100%, full-fledged, prime USDA, whacko. Yes, George. But he's the most winningest programmer in history. He is very good. Good? I don't give a damn about good. I said he wins. You know the difference? Yes, George. I mean, no, George. Herbert. How big is your cock? I beg your pardon? How big is your cock? Is it nine inches? Seven inches? Two inches? About seven inches, I guess. Seven inches? That's good! That's good. That's pretty good. Thank you, sir. My cock used to be seven inches. Do you know how large it is now? No, George. Take a guess. Oh, I... I don't know. A man of your size... I guess, maybe... Eleven and one-quarter inches. Exactly. You know how I know? No, George, I measure it each and every day. Good idea. Eleven and one-quarter inches. Up from seven inches. You know what made the difference? No. Won't you take a guess? Nautilus? No, no! No, winning! The Kentucky Derby. The America's Cup. The Super Bowl. Winning. Winning made it grow. The difference between just being good and winning? Four and a quarter inches. And after this record, it'll be five. And that's why... That's why Billy's in charge. He may be a whacko, but he makes my cock grow. You understand? Yes, George. Good. Now, let's go join the party, huh? (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Personally, I don't think "The Civil War" can sustain for a half hour. What about the new pilot from Spelling? That... That's a definite maybe. What do you think? For a comedy, it's much too funny for the concept. What do you think, Herbert? Me? I'll get back to you on that. So we lost the car and two stuntmen. Now that's sad, but... Great footage. Great footage. Can't wait for you to see it. Good to see you tonight, too. Good to see you. Okay, thank you. Good night, good night. Hi, Herbert. Uh, Mr. Plunkett, my name's Linda Carlisle, and I'm the new intern in bookkeeping and I just wanted to say that I'm looking forward to working with you and the network. Well, thank you very much. I've followed your career closely. You've been a role model of mine. In fact, I went to the same university as you. You went to Emporia? Only for two years. (LAUGHING) Two years? Well, you got me beat. I flunked out in one. (LAUGHING) What about "Day Time"? "Day Time"? It's good. It's early, but it's good. Mr. Patrick does not drink alcohol. Glass of iced tea, please. Sir? Can I help you? I am... Well, come on, out with it! I've been assigned to be your personal ratings courier. Buck green rookie messenger. Shit! You nervous? I remember my first time. I was about your age. I was nervous. But I wasn't gonna let the old man down. I knew that if I worked harder than anyone and longer than anyone and put my trust in the hands of the Lord, the numbers would be there for me. And if you do that, the numbers will be there for you, too. Anything else? No, sir. You like jazz? I'll get back to you on that. COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) Perryton Park, Oregon. Off. Off.

(WOMAN MOANING) Look at this, here's the headline of the New York Daily News. "Montreal Knocking on Ze Door." The question is will New York hang on? Maybe, maybe not. All right, the first week's Fielding ratings are up. And, not surprisingly, George Plunkett's network resides safely in first place. But let me tell you what is surprising. The margin of victory, the margin of victory is only five points, nearly five points short of all expectations. Check out this... What? Even more shocking is the fact that most of these points were gained by, well, not by the rival commercial networks... Georgie? (DOOR SHUTS) Documentary special entitled Come on, come on back! "The History of Limoges." (CHUCKLES) Come on, Limoges! Gelpin, what's Limoges? GEORGE: (IN DISTANCE) Son of a bitch! FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Softball practice will be Thursday at 3:00 p.m. MONA: Mr. Sain? It's Stan Nussbaum on line one. STUART: Stan? Dinner Thursday? Montrachet, dinner, Thursday sounds good. Okay, okay, fine. See you then. Yoo-hoo. Got a sec? Thank you. Sure, sure. Come on in. Come on in. I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated your support the other day. Oh, you're welcome. It just came straight from the heart. Wow... Did you hear the news? I guess there's a lot more Limoges lovers out there than we thought. That's great! Yeah. Oh, I got such a good feeling about you, Stuart Sain. Anyway, so, well... That's all I wanted to say. Any time. (MUMBLING) One more thing. One more thing. Um... I'd like your opinion. Which do you find more intriguing between these two programs? "Where Have Our Oceans Gone?" Or... "Kennedy, What's Left to Say?" Which ocean? (BELLS JANGLING) STUART: They were interested in my opinions. Can you believe it? My opinions! You mean you haven't plateaued? I love you. You're smart. Oh, by the way, do you remember Stan Nussbaum? Who? Stan Nussbaum. No. Neither do I, but we're having dinner with him next Thursday. I'm telling you, this is the best thing that's ever happened to us, ever. Did they tell you what you're supposed to do? Not really. I mean, I guess I'm just going to do the same thing I've always been doing. But you really don't do anything. Well, apparently, I must do something because I'm doing it now at a much higher level. (DOG WHINING) Sorry, Phoebe. Okay, time to go sleep. (CHUCKLES) Phoebe, you're Mommy is terrific. Phoebe. Ask your daddy if he wouldn't rather sleep with Rachel. No, I love your mommy. In fact... I wish there were two mommies. Two mommies? Yeah, big mommy. Maybe a little mommy. Won't that be fun Phoebe? A big mommy and a little mommy. What's that supposed to mean? I just thought with the new job, you know it's... Got more money. We might reconsider. Reconsider what? Well, you know. We're gonna have a little bit more time. Whose time, yours? 'Cause my hours haven't changed. What does that mean? (SCOFFS) It means that my work is just as important to me as yours is to you, and I have no intention of leaving it just because you get a new job. You're right. Stuart, I've put my life into this clinic. I thought I had your total commitment on this. I mean, I have been doing such great work with these people. And now you throw me this curve ball? (SIGHS) I'm sorry. Come here, come here, come here. Mmm. (SIGHS) Look, tomorrow is Family Day at the clinic. All right, I want you to come down and sit in on a session. I want you to see the progress I'm making with these people. You know, they need me. And you're gonna see, they're not bad people. They just... They just need love. Sure. I wanted to cut her eyes out. (HOARSLEY) It wasn't me. It was the drugs. Is that why you attacked your mother? And her three friends? And your dad? They were getting stoned. Every time I even smell pot, I go nuts, man. I can't control it. I go into this fuckin' rage! I want to kill! I want to kill! (SCREAMING) I want to kill! (SOBBING) CARY: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know how much one needs love. (STUART COUGHING) It's okay. (COUGHING) (MOUTHING) I'll meet you at home, okay? ANNOUNCER: You are watching GPN, the George Plunkett Network. Join our family! ANNOUNCER 2: Her name was Mickey Munson Lyle. She ran the fastest quarter-mile in history. Yet, she never broke a sweat. Why? Wisp O'Wind deodorant. ANNOUNCER 2: Where have our oceans gone? (WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Plunkett is number one. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) ANNOUNCER: We've always been there. We'll always be there. Wisp O'Wind... COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) GPN. GPN. PBT. PBT. PBT... MAN: Be at 12 o'clock. No, no! Don't look, don't look. MAN: Uh-oh! REGIS: Well once again, the ratings are in. And surprisingly, once again, George Plunkett's network has lost points to the special report, "Where have our oceans gone?" Where have our oceans gone? Give me a break! Is this the beginning of a trend or what? GEORGE: Son of a bitch! Ow! It doesn't make sense! (WHISPERS) Just doesn't make sense. It's a fluke, I'm telling you. You can't come in here right now. Billy. I need action. Have you seen these? Of course we've seen them. And? It's a fluke. How can you be sure? The points were lost in the Midwest to PBT. So? So everyone knows the Midwest not only doesn't watch PBT, they don't even know how to spell PBT. Well, it says here that they can! What are the possibility that this "culture" trend is real? Billy, don't you think you should have something in development? Negative. All data shows that this is temporary. There's nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about? Well, I'll give you something to worry about, you four-eyed, chicken shit son of a bitch. You keep him away from me! George, calm down. Calm down? Don't tell me to calm down! I wanna know what's going on, and who's is responsible. BILLY: Yes. Who is responsible? There's gotta be a reason for this. Are we doing anything differently now. Every number, every piece of data says that we are on course. I see no reason to turn and blame them. Well, then, who in the hell do we turn to? Oh... (ORGAN PLAYING) Almighty Lord. We beg thy forgiveness. For allowing ourselves to become a permissive society, profiting at the expense of others. BILLY: But I need guidance. Am I playing it too safe? Have we become complacent? Give me a sign. Give me a sign. In a startling move today, Major League Baseball canceled the final 25 games of the regular season, and moved up the World Series to begin next week. REPORTER: George! How you doing? Is it true that you paid off the owners to cancel the season? Isn't this just a cheap ratings ploy? (CHUCKLES) Fellas, fellas, look. What is everybody getting so worked up about? I mean, the only reason... Let me assure you this, the only reason for a change in the Series was for the benefit of the fans. Was it also for the benefit of the Montreal fans? (SCOFFS) Let's be honest. I mean, who wants to play baseball in late October in Montreal. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) I mean, you have to play on ice skates. Besides, October is a busy month for people. Yeah. I mean, you got your Columbus Day, and you got Halloween... You gotta set your clocks back. Yeah, it's... You know, it's... Yes, sir. There you have it. It's a nice tie. MONA: Mr. Sain, look, I finished the softball schedule. Oh, Mona, this is all wrong. You've got one team playing two games at the same time and we're not scheduled at all. But we're playing the "Bye's." No, "Bye" is not the name of a team. "Bye" means you have a week off. Now we have to start all over from scratch. (PHONE RINGING) I was hoping to have this done by today. Mr. Sain's office. Yes, Ms. Rowen. I'll ask him. Mr. Sains, Ms. Rowen would like to see you in her office. Oh, my god! Do you believe this picture? I thought I looked great. I must have been on acid. You were. (ALL LAUGHING) Do you remember the time we got arrested trying to close down the ROTC? Poor Miles was arrested. You and I were too busy making out, remember? Yes, well, I'm glad you guys had a good time. We did. Don't worry. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Oh, Stuart! Oh, great, come on in. I want you to meet a couple of old college cronies of mine. This Susan Steenland. Hello! And Peter Miles. How are ya? Fine. They're working with me on my "Plight of the Boat People" special. Sounds like fun! So, Stuart, I asked these guys here so they could tell them your ideas about the schedule. The schedule? Yeah, the schedule. Have you thought about it? Well, I'm afraid I haven't gotten it nailed down just yet. Of course you haven't, but they're just interested in your impressions on how you think the season's gonna go. Oh, the season. Oh, I'm very optimistic. (GASPS) You see, he's optimistic. Can we seriously be competitive? Do you really think this line-up can sustain against the big boys? Oh, I think as the season goes along, we'll get much stronger. Stronger? Oh, sure you see, the key is to evaluate your talent, and then show patience. I don't want to sound overly optimistic, right now, but the league they we're in, the competition, isn't the strongest. So with the right chemistry and a little luck, I think we have a chance to finish the season first. Ah! First? Rachel, is he serious? Why not? We've got a good attitude, good people, and a real dedication to winning. Isn't that what makes a champion? What did I tell you about this guy? ANNOUNCER: This could be a key to a good start. Here he comes... Score! Oh, brother. He doesn't score. He doesn't score! SARAH: Zachariah, your daughter is becoming disrespectful. I am not disrespectful. You said you hated the corn. I call that disrespectful. HANNAH: I didn't say I hated the corn. I said the broccoli was better. There! Did you hear? That's enough. Zachariah, did you hear what she said? I said that's enough! (TV SHORT CIRCUITS) I'm watching television, can't you see that? ANNOUNCER 2: Now we return to "Kennedy, What's Left to Say." Here we see a forgotten photo taken by a... What did you do? I didn't do anything. ANNOUNCER 1: Bottom of the ninth. Man, oh, man! WOMAN: East Jabib, Iowa, reporting. PBT... (TV ANNOUNCER SPEAKING) WOMAN: PBT, PBT, PBT... (TV ANNOUNCER SPEAKING) Whoa! (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Billy, Billy, Billy, you know I adore you. And this is bottom line, straight from the kishkes. Prepare yourself to fall in love with this idea. This is a top ten... See I'm putting myself down, top ten. This is a top five, beautiful, half-hour sitcom... GEORGE: Hello, Billy. We were in the neighborhood, so we thought we'd stop by, see what's happening. You don't mind, do you, Billy? Good. How about you, Eric? Mind? No... I know people who would kill their children to be in a room with men of your power and dignity. Okay. Here it is. You're ready? This is a college dorm run by a dorm counselor. But it's a co-ed dorm and a hunky dorm counselor. Look at that face. He's imagining the complications. (LAUGHING) Funny stuff. And it's so fresh, man. It's so fresh. And it's got sex. Eric, this show is not for... Excuse me, Billy. I think the show should be set in ancient Greece. You think? That way the show has a classic background. And we can stick in Aristotle and Homer. ERIC: Yeah, yeah. And I like it, I like it. And it's still got sex. ERIC: Yeah. HERBERT: It'll be the first "culture-com." I got the title. I got the title. It's coming... It's "Greek's Company." (BOTH LAUGHING) Eric. Yeah? Would you excuse us for a minute? Are you sure Billy? I think we're really cooking here. We're on a roll? Get out! Gentlemen, I will not tolerate any interference into my jurisdiction. Is that understood? You know, Herbert, this just maybe the show we've been looking for. Sir, I think we should give it first priority. I will not be told which programs to develop. When are those guys from the BBC arriving? They should be here any second. BBC guys? What are you talking about BBC guys? It's good, because I want the Brits in on this. They really know culture. No personnel decisions will be made without my authorization. Anything else, sir? Nope! Where are you headed? Let's go! That does it! All right, fatso. What the hell do you think you're trying to do to my network? Your network? You and your holy Joe, kiss-my-ass strategy. Do you think I'm gonna sit here and do nothing? Oh, I see. Somebody scores a run, now you want to play coach. Billy, nothing much really has changed. We've just decided to take a little more personal... Shut up, you little turd. I'm talking to you, fat ass. You think this is all my fault, don't you? Nobody said that... Shut up! You know what I think? I think people want something new. Something different. Sir, the new programmers from the BBC are here. Who the hell are you? WOMAN: This is Mr. Rawly and Mr. Gossage. RAWLY: Hello, mates. GOSSAGE: Mornin' all. Looking forward to stamping out the fire, eh, governor? Have you looked over our schedule? Your schedule? Have we ever. You called us in the nick of time, squire. Not to worry though, we've got just the solution. Sir, I can't believe the disrespect... Just wait. You know what I mean, governor? And we'll add an impress track. A what? An impress track. Something we just developed. It'll work the same way as your laugh tracks do. What the fuck are they talking about? We think the problem lies in the fact that you Yanks might not be too sure that what's being said is important. This will solve the problem. Absolutely. Ah! Positively. An impress track? It'll revolutionize drama. Sir, this'll put your name in the history books. You'll go down as the man who made culture commercial. How does that make you feel? I don't give a flying fuck about it. All I know is that if culture is what America wants, then fucking culture is what they're going to get! (CELLO PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: This is Leslie Maninoff. His friends call him "The Rock." At night, he is a world-renowned cellist, scaling the arpeggios of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. But by day, he's fighting for harmony for all mankind. Time to face the music. Scumbag! Whether it's convicts or concertos, fugues or fisticuffs, he's all action. (GRUNTS) With the "Kicking the Habit" co-star, Spoon Nettles. Watch for "Rock-maninoff C.C. Classical Crime Fighter"! And now sit back and laugh with "Greek's Company"! Pythagoras, shmagoras. Who cares if I don't ace Socrates' exam? I mean, after all, Aphrodite isn't exactly a celestial scientist. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Oh, Clinique. Deltoid! Oh, Clinique... Oh, Deltoid! Working hard? BOTH: Xanex! Oh, we were just studying. Yeah, right! Come on, I know what you two were up to. Yeah, I used to make out under the Parthenon before you kids could read a sundial. (LAUGHING) (CRASHING) Homer, is that you? Great god, what these kids doing moving these poles like this? I'm gonna call my friend Achilles. You think this is funny. This ain't funny to me! Holy, Zeus! Where's the mercury? My goodness! MAN: You promised me this renovation would cost me no more than 6,800. And I get a bill here for 27,500? (FUSE BLOWS) You're damn right, we gotta problem here. COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) PBT, PBT... MAN: Not my problem. Your problem RECORDED VOICE: PBT, PBT, PBT... I invited every critic to witness this. Well, it better work. ANNOUNCER: George Plunkett Play House proudly presents William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Prince of Denmark, starring Joe Piscopo. O that this too, too sullied flesh would melt. Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew. VOICES: Ooh. Ahh. VOICES: Ooh. Ahh. Or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon 'gainst self-slaughter. VOICES: Ooh! Yes! I see. What in the hell were those voices? That's the impress track, sir. Brilliant isn't it? Bloody brilliant! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Get the fuck out of here! Before I kick your asses back to Piccadilly! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (CRYING) ALL: Keep coming back, 'cause it works if you work it. (ALL CHEERING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Letter for you, Cary. How could you be late? We're supposed to be there by now. CARY: Stuart, I'm sorry. They want to close the clinic. What am I supposed to do? I know, but Rachel said eight sharp. CARY: Could we forget about Rachel? We're talking about my work here. Just hand me my dress. Sixteen hundred dollars? CARY: It's a Comme des Garcon. A what? A Comme des Garcon. A leading designer. And these shoes? What did they cost? CARY: They were $300. But I got them on sale for 150. Tell me, why do women's shoes cost so much? There's no shoe here? I mean... Show me a shoe! Where's the shoe? CARY: If you're going to hobnob with these types, don't you think your wife has to look nice? I'm not hobnobbing. I'm schmoozing. It's part of my job. Yeah, well, it's not part of mine. Wow! Wow! You look great! That's a great dress! Oh, man, that's very hot. I thought you wanted me to hurry up. Well, I do, but I'm horny. Well, I'm pissed off. Stuart, they can't close my clinic. (SIGHS) It's okay. What is this? There's an armpit hole? I guess we can tickle you here. (LAUGHING) Stop it! Stop it! No, come on... Who did they design this for, the alien? (CARY SCREAMS) I promise I'll make it up to you. Are you speaking to me? I feel terrible. I sincerely hope so. It was an accident. You did it on purpose. I did not! Yes, you did. Are you going to speak every time I do? Probably. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Oh, Cary, Stuart. Oh, it's great to see you. I'm so glad you could come. And it is so good to see you again, Cary. Nice to see you, Rachel. Organic champagne? Oh! You must try this. It's made from recycled grapes. It's divine. Oh, wow! Tastes almost real. Now. Let me point out the usual suspects. That's Guy Monaco of Greenpeace. And, oh, Gary Calter of Bristol-Myers or Searle, or one of those companies. (GASPS) And there's my chief supporter, Doris Hays-Britton. Darling, how are you? Fabulous! There's some people I want you to meet. This is Cary and Stuart Sain. What a beautiful dress. That's a Comme des Garcon, isn't it? Why, yes. (LAUGHING) Oh, you were right about this one. He's got great taste. Thank you. And what do you do, dear? I work with drug addicts. (SOBBING) Did I say something wrong? Doris' husband was killed by a drug addict. Oh, great. Damn criminal. They should have locked up in jail. Oh, my wife doesn't work with criminals. No, I work in rehabilitation. He was in rehabilitation. Hey, what kind of year you think the Yankees are gonna have? Anyway, I won't be doing it much longer. They're gonna close my clinic. And the Mets, could surprise, you know. Why are they going to close your clinic? Oh, it seems that there are more deserving areas for the funds that we need. Terrible, but what are you going to do? A lot. Exactly. What? What do you need to keep your clinic open, Cary? $25,000. I'll get it for you. You will? I will. You will? I'll produce a special on the plight of clinics in America. I could use your clinic as an example. You wouldn't mind, would you, Cary? Mind? That's great! And I'll find underwriters for it. Starting with you, Doris. Me? Yes! Oh, Rachel! You know my feelings about this... But that's exactly why you have to do this. My friend the liberal. Rachel, I can't tell you how this is gonna help. I've been telling Stuart how you're the best thing that's ever happened to him. (CHUCKLES) Doris, look who just walked in. Oh, my God. They must have dropped the indictment. It's Jim McMasters. He's a low-life degenerate, but a fun low-life degenerate. And, of course, successful. Oh, very successful. Excuse us, won't you? Nice to meet you both. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING MOCKINGLY) Oh, shut up! Don't say it! I didn't say a word. I know that shit-eating grin on your face. Are talking to me? Are you going to smirk all night? Probably. Ow! (KNOCK ON DOOR) Sir, can I get you anything? They're laughing at me. "They," sir? When I was a little boy, they laughed at me. The called me names. Tank, two-ton, tubby, fatty, fatso. Boulder boy, bubble butt, bubble face, jelly-belly. I never dated. I never scored. I swore that one day, I'd show them. That I'd make them pay. And now, they're... They're laughing at me. Because... They know. They know. Sir, I'm sure you're exaggerating. Look, I'll prove it to you. Ow! (LAUGHING) Why so gloomy, George? Don't you know it's always darkest before the dawn? People want something new, something different. Isn't that what you said? What the hell do you know about people? And I'm not talking about that jet-set, smart ass, amoral crowd of yours. I'm talking about good, hard-working, God-fearing Americans. What they want. What they need. Nothin'. You know nothin'! Talk is cheap, Billy! I need numbers. Numbers! I'm gonna get you numbers. I'll get you the greatest numbers that anyone's ever seen. I'm gonna save your ass, jelly-belly. In a last ditch effort to capture first place in the all important sweeps ratings, George Plunkett's Network announced it has canceled tomorrow night's regularly scheduled programs and will air instead a line-up consisting of "Debbie Does Denver," an Iraqi execution, and a bullfight. REPORTER: Emotions have been running high over the moral implications of airing of such programs. The programming move is being condemned by all major civic organizations. It is also expected to draw the largest viewer audience in television history. (TELEPHONES RINGING) Hello? Sorry, no comment. Hello? Sorry, no comment. Hello? Sorry, no comment. Hello. What? My name! I'll get back to you on that. Sir, we might want to reconsider. It might be a good idea not to go through with this. What are you talking about? We can say it was all a bad publicity stunt. We've got to go through with this. Sir, I'm begging you to reconsider. We have no guarantees... Guarantees? Restaurants are closing. Every motel room in town is booked. What do you think they're going to be watching? Culture, or pussy! Washington is very upset. Fuck 'em. They're talking about bringing in the IRS. The IRS? I don't know. You wanted a winner, didn't you? Here's your chance. Yeah, Billy, but... But what? What's the matter, George? Your dick getting soft? All right, Billy. You win. But you'd better have some good ratings or your ass is going out that window. You still don't understand, do you? We're not just fighting for ratings. BILLY: We are fighting a much greater enemy. COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) PBT, PBT... And you must fight evil with evil. BILLY: But do you realize... (SCREAMING) Holy shit! Did you see that? BILLY: That more people... Holy shit! That is good TV! BILLY: Will be watching TV tonight... COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) PBT... PBT... BILLY: Than ever before... COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) PBT... I am his messenger. BILLY: And tonight more people will see His message. BILLY: And this time, I cannot lose! COMPUTER: (IN FEMALE VOICE) PBT, PBT, PBT... BILLY: I'll never lose! In one of the greatest upsets of all time, Public Broadcast Television last night topped all competition. It has become the number one network for the first time in its history... Hey, George! Who'd have thunk it? I'm gonna kill ya! Where the hell are ya? You better be praying! You better be praying that I don't find your ass! I'm gonna kill ya! Herbert here will act as an interim head programmer until a suitable replacement is found. Fired. Gone. Ladies and gentlemen, Billy Patrick has been a member of this family for over 30 years. Letting him go was the hardest decision I've ever made. (LAUGHING) Meanwhile, the ratings victory of PBT is definitely having its effect on the American public. KING: Bookstores are reporting record sales. Art museum contributions have increased by over 500%. Even pawn shops are experiencing peculiarities. REPORTER: What do you think of the cultural phenomena? I love it. I think it's great! REPORTER: Sir? Hey, don't bother me. I got no time. Yeah, it's great! I've been watching public broadcasting for years. REPORTER: Who's your favorite? Benny Hill. If you look back to as far as the '60s, you see the various movements that inspired this trend. Watergate, the Beatles' break-up, Altamont. And remember, Dylan did say, "I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more." To add icing on the cake, PBT has been named this year's recipient of a Peabody Award, for excellence in media. And along with PBT, the Fielding Corporation for their mother ship ratings computer will also be honored. You know I think it's the best thing that's ever happened to this country. I mean, I really do! BOTH: Let's just hope some jerk doesn't come along and screw it up! Okay, here we go! Take a base, take a base! STUART: Okay, back her up. Back her up on that one. Back her up! Two men, two men should back her up. Here we go! Half field. Center field! Center field! Center field! Center field! It's okay. It's a long season. Hey! Didn't I see you on TV? My picture's been in the paper, I guess. (LAUGHING) Yeah! God, that's a beautiful animal! Hey! What breed is that? Uh, she comes from a line of many champions. (CHUCKLES) Stuart! Hi, honey! Bye-bye! Oops! Oops! Oops! Hey you know what? Don't worry about it. Go ahead! Let me get that. No, no, no! Seriously! I swear to God! Go ahead! I'll pick it up for you! You sure? Yeah, yeah. It's really good to meet you. Okay, thanks! Okay. Bye! STUART: New home! Come on, Phoebe, let's go! That looks good. What is that? Hey, hey, hey! I don't want your germs. (CHUCKLES) Wait a minute! Wait... How come I can stick my tongue down your throat, but I can't stick my fork in your food? Oh, that's different. That's in a moment of passion. The heat of your love destroys the bacteria. (SCOFFS) Oh! Is that so? However, if you would like some hygienic action, that can be arranged. Ooh! Hey! Are you naked now? Oh, yeah! What would you do to me if was there? Diary time, boss. They got a brother up here late. But that's all right, because... I can use the phone. I gotta cross reference some of these diaries. Ah, but you keep going ahead, baby, you go ahead and jam. Hmm! All right. So I'm naked, you're naked now. Now what about your girlfriend? She's there. All right. Um... Look, baby, we gotta continue this later, all right? Yeah, you keep on playing and daddy will be home soon. No, no, I'm sure. I'll pick up those batteries on the way home, all right. I gotta little something to do here I'm sure with that. I'll talk to you later. Bye! ANNOUNCER: The cocktail party for tonight's Peabody Awards will begin... Beautiful, yeah! Congratulations! Good one! Sain, give 'em hell at the Peabody Awards tonight. Thank you! Mi Peabody es su Peabody! Big night tonight, huh, Mona? Mr. Sain, there's a man waiting in your office. He wouldn't give his name, but said, he was your "partner." Should I get security? Leon! Partner! How's it going, man? What's up? You know, your office is nice. Your living, kinda, kinda large, man! Well, I have you to thank for it, indirectly. Interesting how things turn out, huh? You know, I never thought I'd say this, but between you and me, it's great to be number one. Yeah, well, between you and me, you ain't. I don't get it. You ain't number one. What are you talking about? What do you think I'm talking about, partner? The ratings. The ratings? What's gotten into you? (WHISPERING) Leon, are you stoned? I wish I was, partner. I went over it three times, man. It came out the same. Leon, make sense? Look, I helped you out, all right? Now you gotta make sure you help me out. It's not my fault the damn things are broken. What is broken? The boxes, or the mother ship. Either way, the numbers are inaccurate. No. How can that be? Take a look for yourself. Leon, you shouldn't take your diaries off. You can get into a lot of trouble for this stuff. I checked the diaries to the bible, three times man! The numbers are wrong! My God! Your serious! Now, you're the only person who knows about this, man. I called in sick today, I don't know how long I can hold this out. Now, listen, partner, if they fire me, I'm going to need a gig. all right. You're a big man around here. You're gonna hook me up. Look, Leon, relax, relax. Okay. Nobody's going to fire you. You just gotta sit tight. You gotta give me a little time here, okay? Just, just give me some time. I'll see what I can do, okay? All right. All right. Don't forget about me, partner. Gotta get these back. Hey, Leon. Out of curiosity, how has PBT done since I joined them? You dropped below the Weather Channel. Uh-huh. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Rachel? RACHEL: Stuart? I'm in the bathroom. Oh, um, I just needed a moment, but if it's a bad time, I can come back. RACHEL: No, I'm just trying something on. I'll be right out. Do me a favor? When you speak tonight, try not to mention anything about my war protest record, okay? I'm not ashamed, but it might be embarrassing. Rachel, I just got some news. Ta-da! (GASPS) What do you think? Donna Karan designed it for me herself? You look lovely! Number one! Yes! Oh, can you believe this? Oh, God! Well, I'm sure it's just temporary. You can be sure of that. I guess so. (LAUGHING) Just take it while you can. You know, Rachel. Hypothetically speaking, what if the numbers hadn't been there? What a silly question. No, seriously. Wouldn't you have been just as pleased with your accomplishments? Of course not. You wouldn't? No! It's... It's nice when you think you know what you're talking about. But it is better when everyone thinks you know what you're talking about. Well, it seems that everyone doesn't know what anyone's talking about. I don't follow. It seems the numbers are wrong. I don't understand. What numbers? The rating numbers. They're wrong. We're not number one. We never have been. Are you sure? Unfortunately. How did you find out about this? My ex-colleague at Fielding just told me. Look, it's not public yet, but I was thinking that tonight might be a good time to be forthcoming. Tonight? Yeah, I thought it'd be a good way to salvage public support. Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't worry about it tonight. There's nothing we can do about it. I wouldn't even bring it up. Really? Tonight's our victory. Let's enjoy it. But we're being honored for something we didn't achieve. I'm not comfortable with that. Stuart, can you help me unhook this? I beg your pardon? It's stuck. Do you mind? I guess not. You know it sounds silly, but I swear winning makes me feel sexier. Silly, isn't it? Rachel, I think... You know, Stuart, from the first moment I saw you, I knew you had something. Luck. Who was it who said it, "It's better to be lucky than smart"? They were talking about you. But luck doesn't last forever, does it? I know that what we're doing probably isn't the perfect thing to do, but we earned this moment. We don't want to look like fools, do we? With all due respect, I think we're making a mistake. Ah! By the way, (SIGHS) I started the paperwork on that documentary about your wife's drug clinic. And I think I'll have no problem passing it through. Oh, I appreciate that, Rachel. But about tonight... Like I said, I think I'll have no problem passing it through. I see. Anything else? No. Well, then, you better get a move on. It's a big night tonight. It's not everyone who gets to pick up a Peabody Award. Right. ANNOUNCER: And now it's time to go live to the Peabody Awards with the entertainment correspondent, Linda Carlisle. We're live at the annual Peabody Awards dinner. Among the recipients tonight will be PBT, and the Fielding Corporation for their contribution of the new mother ship ratings computer. LINDA: Dignitaries are arriving... REPORTER: George! Come on! One minute. Oh, come on, George. LINDA: It's a hub of activity here. Everybody is very, very excited. Reporting here at the Peabody Awards, Linda Plunkett... Linda Carlisle, Plunkett News. CARY: I am so excited. I think this PBT special is the best thing that has ever happened to this clinic. Thank God, for people like Rachel. Just reaffirms my faith in humanity. It is gonna do so much good for so many people, you have no idea. Baby, what's the matter? You don't look good. No, I'm fine. Oh, God! You're dripping with sweat. Really? Oh! Just nerves. Just wanna get there. Where are we? Hey, driver, thanks for making a right in Peru. Stuart, what's going on? Nothing. Hey, I live with you, remember. Come on. Something is wrong and you're not telling me. Now what is it? What! (SIGHS) They're broken. What's broken? The Fielding boxes are broken. What do you mean broken? Broken, as in "They don't work right." The numbers are wrong. I don't understand. What don't you understand? The numbers are wrong. Stuart, make sense. I am making sense. You mean you're not number one? We're below the Weather Channel. Did you tell Rachel? Of course. And what did she say to do? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Nothing, as in nothing. She doesn't think it's a good time to bring it up. (SIGHS) I'm shocked. Although I shouldn't be. I told you to watch out for her. Okay, we're here. (REPORTERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Let's go! So what are you going to do? What am I going to do? Yeah. What are you going to do? I'm not going to do anything. What do you mean you're not going to do anything? Which word don't you understand? I'm not going to do anything. Stuart, the people have got to know. Know what? The truth. You've got to tell them the truth. Like hell I do! CARY: Stuart! You want me to go up there and tell the world that PBT is not number one, and that this whole cultural revolution, which, incidentally, is only the best thing that's ever happened to this country, is invalid? Not a chance. CARY: Stuart. I have no intention of bursting this bubble and then watch America kick me in the ass for it. It is your moral responsibility! Have you forgotten the warm response I got for my last moral responsibility? Do you remember the softball controversy? Or would you like to see the spot where they shoved the bat? That was different. You bet it was. That was only nine people. We're talking about 250 million. That's a lot of bat. Now, I'd love to chat about this further, but unfortunately, I have got to go collect a Peabody Award. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) REPORTER 1: Who's that? REPORTER 2: Oh, that's, that's Stuart Sain! ALL: Stuart, Stuart... Congratulations! Oh, thank you very much! Stan Nussbaum! You've got to say something. You know what I think? I think you're jealous. What? I think you're jealous because I'm getting a Peabody Award, and you're not. (SIGHS) That is the most ridiculous thing you've ever said. Is it? Tell me, how many Peabody Awards do you have? CARY: Am I hearing this? Have you lost your mind entirely? STUART: Look, tonight is our victory. Let's enjoy it. Stuart this goes against everything you've stood for. Okay, curiously, just for one moment, let's say the public never finds out. What would be so terrible? I can't believe I'm hearing this. What? Why? Where is it written that everybody's has to know everything? The Pentagon doesn't reveal their sources, do they? No! Did you know when your parents made love? No! What are you babbling about? Where the hell is this place? Stuart! Look, for the first time in my life I've caught a break. Let's not blow it. I mean, nobody's been hurt, right? Everybody's happy. I'm happy. Stuart, you can't just think about yourself. Okay, fine, let's talk about you. What about me? You want your clinic to say open, don't you? Whoa, wait! What's that got to do with anything? Rachel made it very clear that if I said anything, she's gonna pull out of your fundraiser. She did? She sure did! (SIGHS) Oh. Well that's different. Let's go. Fine! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Thank you! Thank you! Ladies and gentlemen, I humbly accept this award from my peers. The people who have made it a point of making the media a better and more responsible place. RACHEL: The people who bring us the truth. No matter how much it hurts. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) With that phony smile of yours, you look more Asian than I do. Thank you, dear. What we have accomplished is not as important as what we all have accomplished. And I'm proud that tonight my fellow recipient is none other than the Fielding Corporation, and their mother ship computer. The most accurate data gathering service ever... You know, when I was appointed head of PBT... "Life is like film." "It only develops if you give it your best shot!" God, I don't know if I can go through with this. I know it's tough. Let's try. Oh, and now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce you to a man, who gets up in the morning full of integrity... Stuart, how can you do this? It's easy. Take deep breaths. I can't live a lie. Sure you can. You lied about the cost of those shoes, didn't you? A hundred and fifty dollars, please! And my right arm. Ladies and gentlemen, Stuart Sain. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) All the best! I am very happy and very proud to accept this Peabody Award. (SCOFFS) First of all, I want to thank Rachel Rowen, who gave me my chance, and whose leadership sets the tone for the standard that PBT sets. And finally, I wanna thank my wife, Cary. I don't know what I'd do without you. Keep lying and you'll find out. Life is like film, it only develops if you give it your best shot. Well, at PBT, I believe we gave it our best shot. It's not the truth and you know it. It is your moral responsibility. To get along, you go along. Jeez, it's not as if we killed innocent people or anything. Give me break. We're not interested in who's hot and who's not. Everybody wants to be number one! What happened to character? What happened to integrity? I mean, look who's talking about integrity and character. What the hell is he talking about? So, what am I supposed to do? I mean, this is why I'm in this situation, you know? You're damned if you do. You're damned if you don't. What the hell is he talking about? See I think the problem is the fact that we put too much emphasis on winning. Right here. Now that makes sense. You see, that makes sense! What the fuck is he talking about? Stuart, you're mumbling. Thank you! Stuart, go ahead and say it. Thank you, thank you very much. Is this guy a fruitcake or what? Go ahead. You know you want to. Hey, darling, do I heckle you at your job? He's a fruitcake. Stuart, yeah, be smart. What's going on? Rachel, I mean, we didn't do anything wrong. It's not our fault. I mean, if you really think about it, the mistake was bound to happen sooner or later. Excuse me. What mistake was bound to happen sooner or later? I beg your pardon? You just said a mistake was bound to happen sooner or later. I did? Yeah, you did. Oh, no. What I meant to say is that we've got to start rely on our own instincts rather than these machines. That way we wouldn't have to worry about the accuracy of these ratings. What about the ratings? Who said anything about the ratings? You just questioned the accuracy of the ratings. I Did? Yeah, you did. Well... Personally, I think accuracy can be very overrated. Wait a minute. Is there something wrong with the ratings? It depends how you define the word "wrong." Stuart! Are you saying the boxes are broken? Broken is a really strong word. Besides, it might not even be the boxes. It might be the mother ship. Right, Leon? (COUGHS) Partner! I mean, the important thing is so what if PBT is not number one! The important thing is we tried. We tried to do something special. Are you admitting that PBT is not number one? (CHUCKLES) Yes! (AUDIENCE GASPS) The boxes are broken. The numbers are wrong. We are not nor have we ever been number one. (ALL CLAMORING) (CHEERING) Whoa! Feel this, baby! I'm going to vomit. Stuart! Oh, my God! If you knew something was wrong, why didn't you come to me? (SCOFFS) Let's get out here. Well, I did it. I love you. You're smart. (CHUCKLES) Come here. (BOTH TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Get this box out of here, please. Get it out. It's all gone! The renovations look fabulous. Yeah, we're putting the house on the market next week. Molly? Molly, they're taking my damn box. Molly, get me a beer. Get it yourself, you big fat fuck. Molly? Molly? Molly! Yes! That's okay, Mr. Conrad. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. Okay, not a problem. What are you doing with my box? Oh, honey! All the boxes are being recalled. No, they're not! No, you put it back. That's my box. Oh, Mr. Boone... That's my box. You put that back! (SCREAMING) You put my box back! (SCREAMING) I want my box! I want my box! Well, are we going to do something or are we just going to sit here and beat off. Um... Sir, you don't understand. We have no numbers. So? So, we have no numbers. I've got a season starting in six weeks. I need product now! Yes, sir. You. You're in charge now. What the hell are we going to do? First of all, I want to thank you for sponsoring my wife's clinic. It shows a sense of civic responsibility, and both she and I appreciate it. Now, as for the issue at hand, let me ask you a question. Do you guys have a softball team?
