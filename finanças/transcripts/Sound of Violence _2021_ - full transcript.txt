My name is Alexis. And when I hear certain sounds, I don't just hear them, I see them. And the very first time it happened, my whole life changed. Always ready to help. Dad injured? Well... He's fine, right? Well, physically, yes, but it hasn't been easy for him. War is like living through a brutal accident. Remember your accident? That's not the same. I lost my hearing. Sweetie, he needs to feel your love. Just be careful, please. Man, I wish Jordan can come back, we're getting killed. Can we go catch a game? Or just wait for another Space Jam. ...either. Go to your room. You all bore him. At least, me losing my hearing means I can't hear you. Kevin, tell your sister to look at me. Do what your mother tells you. Dad. Do what your mother tells you. I can't hear you. Do as your mother tells you! Do what your mother tells you, baby. Sorry, honey. Moody soon-to-be-teen. Welcome home. Hey, are you okay? I knew that people would never understand what I saw or felt, but all I could think of was that I needed to feel it again. The heartbeat of your work. I find percussions and drums to be the bridge of musical science. It is the human touch elevated to a language. Sounds carry messages and percussions do that. And a beat, by the way, doesn't only come from instruments, a beat can come from anywhere. Like how a heartbeat is a melody, each surface has its own tune. Mr. Bell will be back next week. We'll resume our compositions then. Got you, okay. Hi. Yeah! Hey, roomie. Sorry, I'm late. Oh, yes. Tonight's gonna be dope. Mmhmm. You are one sick puppy, did you know that? Yeah. Mmhmm. I got the mixer, let me get it. Okay. Hmm. Nope. No snooping at my Frankenstein project. What are you talking about? This looks awesome. Anyway, the mixer. Or as a French would call it "la table de mixage". Oh, I learn something new every day. Mmhmm. Uh, that little mixer is really effective. Yeah. Modeled it so that every channel can be separately recorded in raw formats. Yes. Yeah. I'll grab the rest of my favorite wires. Hell yeah. Uh, huh-huh. And your weird little experiment deserves it. Okay. I'll see you at 7:00. Okay. Uh. No. No, uh. Hey, how's it goin'? Hi. Thanks, good. Yeah. I think it works. Everything works, yeah, yeah. So if you have any problems at all, then just bring it back and we'll open it up and take a look. Uh, yeah, it's total, so yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Excuse me? Can I turn this on? Yeah. Do you know how to work one of those? Yeah. Okay, cool. Just be careful, it's kind of an oldie. No problem. Thank you. It's funny, people usually go for Star Trek. You're a total natural. Thanks for letting me play. Have a good day. You, too. Okay. Yeah. You ready? Thanks for getting me into this. Alright. So where do you wanna put the camera? Mm. Oh. Uh, no, wse're not filming. Only sound. All we need is a table and some power. Hmm, alright, just over here. You can use that table. Great, thanks. Okay. Yeah, it's great. Okay, we're all set. We're recording? Yep. Alright, over to you. We need more. Uh, we need to be able to hear them properly. Back in your lane, young lady. I know what I'm doing. It'll be loud enough. Back in your lane, lady. Keep going, harder. We're getting close to his limit. Please, this is great. What else can you use? You remember the signal. Keep going, please. Harder. Harder. Harder. Why are you stopping? That's his limit. He did the signal. He's fine, I'm not done. Dude, he's had enough! We have plenty of material... I'll tell you when I got what I need. Thank you so much for your time. We'll get out of your hair in a minute. You're still not talkin' to me. We got people to take part in your sound experiment, that's what matters. What? It's my fault? The guy had enough. These people push themselves, Marie, that's their shtick. You didn't let me push them. Okay, these people have rules, the most important being we respect their limits. Okay, I know you are this super-experimental rad artist with sounds no one has ever heard of, but you haven't even listened to it. Why would I? I don't think it worked, I didn't get enough. Well, that's what you get with $100 and people from the internet. I know, okay? I just... I need powerful sounds. Just listen to it. Come on. Please. Fine. See? Fig. I can work with that. Yeah? Yeah, you were right. Thank you. Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. I'm so proud of you. Uh. Thanks. Um, I'm gonna let you get to work. Let me know if you need anything. You know where to find me. Yes, I should be good. I'll... I'll see you at home. Okay. Oh, can I keep the recorder for a bit? Of course. Thanks. Okay, see you later. Bye. Oh! Hey, what's up? What's your problem? Oh, come on, you're all alone. Stay the fuck back. You know what I want? Fuck off! Now, you've got what you wanted. Good morning. Is Marie here? Oh, she's in there. I'm Duke, by the way. You want a hit on this? Alexis. I'm good. - Hi. - Hi. You just got in, didn't you? Yeah, pulled an all-nighter. Yeah, you did. Uh, sorry, can I still borrow the recorder and cables? Yeah, I said it was fine. Yeah, you did. Come on, you just wanted a morning hug. Love awkward moments. - Good morning. - Mm, morning Go get some rest. Okay, yeah. Your wife? No, just my bondage party partner. Coffee? Yeah. Wait. So the sound just stopped and you lost your hearing again? Yeah, it was abrupt and I panicked. Any idea what triggered the event? You tell me. Well, looking at the tympanic membrane, the damage remains the same. As you know, when you recovered your hearing, it was because the connection somehow resumed, not the membrane healing, and it won't. And you also know the connections in there are fragile. It does mean they can come on and off a small stimulation. I told you once you're approaching 30, more tests might become necessary as things tend to escalate. This might be an early warning sign. Hi. What's your name? What the fuck are you doing here? This place is no place for a young girl. Let me help you, okay? Are you hungry? Here. Eat this. You're a sweet girl. They don't let me talk to sweet girls no more. It's okay. Irene? Just eat. Just eat, okay? Just eat. Let's get you inside. I can't hear you. Welcome home. Do what your mother tells you! Dad, I can't hear you. I shouldn't get up. I need you. Please, help me. You know, I taught a class this week about how beats are... A language to tell stories. I'm so proud of you. Oh wow. Havin' a good day, huh? Yes, I am. Where have you been the past couple of days? You know, working and experimenting. Looks like it's paying off. Mm, Marie. I've been stuck for so long, but I finally had a breakthrough today. I am feeling so inspired. Well, we should celebrate. Come. You know that I want to, but I'm... I'm in the flow, I'm not yet... Oh, come on! There's lots of people out, people who love you. There'll be cute guys, cute girls. Oh. One for all. Flattery will get you anywhere. Fine. I mean after all I've done for you, you owe me a drink. Basically, a musical pawn shop. - Oh. - Your face. Oh my God. Oh. Fuck you. Fine. The first drink is on me, but then you agree to come with me to this club where I'm playing later. Shut up, that's awesome! Yes! Um, I'm gonna invite Duke, too. Great. This is so exciting! I'm gonna go get drinks, okay? Cool. Thanks. Yeah? Hey, so I've been meaning to ask um, Marie says you make these like dope experimental tracks. I'm still tryin' to figure out like my sound. What's your inspiration? My family died. I need you. Speakers. Huh? Those are XLRs and those are for speaker cables. Some drunk hobo nearby said he heard the music, only kind of witness. This place is a wasteland. It's kind of genius really. Glad you admire that psycho. No, I... didn't mean... Lin, bag tag, get the team to swab all over again. Take pics of everything. Yes, ma'am. The precision, the overkill. It's not over. No scratching! Fuckin' asshole. Thank you. Thanks for your business. Come again. Okay, so that is why I wanted to talk about synesthesia. If someone is able to see sound, then it's no longer just an auditory experience, right? It becomes something deeper, more profound, more connected to the world around us. Are you about to levitate, Mr. Bell? Uh, no. No, actually, I'll wait till the next lecture do that for you. Uh, alright, so in the last 10 minutes or so that we have left I wanna talk about an email that I got from someone who will remain anonymous. Uh, last week apparently, Alexis talked about beat making as a form of human communication, human language, right? Yep. Maybe we could turn the class over to Alexis and let her finish her lecture. - Alexis? - Hmm? You wanna take over and finish your lecture? Oh, sure. Great. Um, I'm not prepared. No, you'll do great. - I get to sit. - But... sure. Okay, um, help me out, guys. My job might be on the line. It is. You know what? Let's try something else. I'm going to play you guys something experimental that I've been working on. Alright, let's give it a listen, guys. What the fuck? Are those animals being slaughtered? Alright, alright, thank you. Everybody, thanks for your feedback. Let's just stop for a second. Alexis, can you turn that off, please? Can you please stop and... and sorry, but what... What on Earth was that? Yeah, okay, I understand that might be a little bit different than what you guys have heard before. Is this a joke? No, look, let me explain. What's wrong with you? Hey, babe, are you home? Are you okay? Phew, okay. Hey, you've reached Alexis, leave a message. Hey, babe um, I heard what happened in class. Students are fucking jerks. Um, call me back when you get this please, okay? Bye. Yes! Hi. You're the person who put the note on the noticeboard for a... for a tenor singer? I'm Jarod. Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you found it. I was worried no one was gonna come. So uh, what is it? What's the pay? Uh, 100 bucks, couple hours max, testing material. We are going to explore your range. Cool. Left some food for the cat, so I'm good on time. Sweet. 150. Oh. Uh, let's see. That's 100 and... ...31, 2... 132. Alright. Great. Where do you want me? Head into the booth, please. Close the door. And don't worry about headphones. Alright, go ahead, warm up, vocalize you know, whatever your routine is. Oh, well, I like to vocalize to our national anthem. Great. ♪ O say can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming ♪ ♪ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ♪ ♪ Through the perilous fight ♪ ♪ O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave ♪ That was beautiful.

Okay, so this is gonna go on your temple. Relax your face. Okay. Hey, I should charge you extra for this, you know? What? I should charge you extra for this, you know? That's not a joke. Do you know Amazing Grace? I'm serious. Yeah, I mean, who doesn't? Uh, fun memories. My brother was so whiny, like every time he was sick, he would not shut up until I sang it to him. Oh, that's really sweet. Music heals all, right? Oh, no, no, no, he did it to put me on show in front of our mom. Conniving little cunt. Well, whatever, it inspires you so I would love to hear it. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ Oh, no, stop. Uh, humming first please, I'll cue you into the lyrics. Slower!

Hey, what is this fucking glue? Fuckin' bitch, turn this fuck thing o... So what have we got? His head exploded. Took two dozen shots of various residues on the walls and floor. The victim's name is Jarod Korkansky according to an expired driver's license in his wallet. e's a record store owner. How does a head explode? Not sure. Those electrodes, they're all over. Some attached to debris and some to him. Not connected to anything, though. Forensics? The whole soundboard was doused in bleach. I'm surprised it didn't catch fire. So we got nothing. I'm sending all DNA samples to the lab. We'll see if any don't match the victim. Great, I won't hold my breath. Something to do with the factory? Definitely. Hello? Where are you? Hi! Oh! Hi, what are you doing here? Um, I was in the neighborhood and I thought maybe you wanted to get some lunch. I can't. Sorry. Are you sure it's healthy for you to be spending this much time here? It's fine. If you don't mind I really need to get back to work. Okay, I'm just... I'm... I'm really worried about you. You haven't texted me back, you haven't been home in two days. Well, I'm fine. You're fine? Yeah, seriously, I'm fine. I really need to get back to it. I'll see you later. I'm gonna be out late tonight, so lock the door. Okay, I'm gonna be out, too. With Duke? Why don't you like him? It's not like we're serious. Okay. Bye then. What's up? Hey. Hey, I'm surprised you called. I thought you were busy. I'm glad I did. You seem enthralled by the works. Yeah. I need a mortgage for one of those. I'm here to support a friend, but I'd much rather spend the evening with you. Oh, so this is a date? Well. What's that you're drinking? This is a pinot noir. Oh. Well, garçon, I'll have a pinot noir, s'il vous plaît. Oh, lady of the world. So no bondage party partner tonight? Uh, no. She's working, so... yeah. But she seems nice. Yeah, she's my little weirdo. She mentioned something to me about like her family dying. Yeah, um... It's fucking horrible. She was like 10 and all she has left is this RV and a garage downtown. Fuck me. That's dark. I need more wine. Yes, me, too! Sorry, that was really loud. Um, a bottle please, quickly. Okay. Bad luck. Um, sorry, I'm gonna be back in like two minutes. Oh, okay. Okay. Hey, sorry, I need like two more minutes. He's being a stickler. I'm really trying to get my hands on that. Okay, go for it. Somebody do something! Stop scaring him! Jesus Christ. I don't know why you're standing here, get out of the way! Oh. Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Somebody call 911! What the fuck are you doing? That's it for now. If you remember anything else, please contact me. Uh, can I go now? Can we drive you anywhere? No, I'm gonna walk. Thanks. Please call me even if you just need to talk. Okay, thanks. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What a fucking date, huh? Did the cops make you feel like a fucking suspect? Yeah, a bit. They have to do that with everyone I guess. It's like just rule out the possibilities. Did you see Alexis in there? What? I don't know what I saw, it was crazy, but I saw a girl by the fire escape like staring at the harpist. Looked like her. Did you say this shit to the cops? No, of course, I didn't. 'Cause you can't unsay that shit. I mean we were drinking wine, we were talking about her family being murdered, maybe you were projecting, but that shit's fucking nuts, you can't fucking say that. What were you saying? I didn't see her then. I couldn't have seen her. I gotta go. - I gotta go. - Marie! - Marie! - No. - Marie, wait! - No! Clear the scene. Lin, pictures. Bag. Mornin'! What are you doin' up so early? I heard some noise and... What's wrong? Are you okay? It was horrible. What happened? I went to this art gallery opening with Duke last night, and there was this... this harpist, and she like... She like cut her fingers and her arms on the strings. That's insane. Are you okay? And it was a panic. There was blood everywhere, and Duke and I were the only people who were helping her. Fuck. You weren't there last night, were you? I know it sounds crazy, but... Duke said he saw you in the crowd and I told him he was a fuckin' lunatic, but... Um, I don't think he's a lunatic, but I was not there. No. My RV and my shitty salad did not feel like a fancy gallery opening, that's for sure. I... How do you get it out of your head? I don't know. I wish I did. I just really don't wanna be alone right now. Okay, come here. Oh. It's okay. I'm sorry. It's... you're fine. I'm such a mess. Stop. There you go. Ugh, Duke. He's saying he can't sleep either, he's so sorry, blah, blah, blah. Wow, he heard that she survived. Oh my God. What a relief. I wanna get some more... some more hot water. I'm going. Fuck. God, I'm so tired. You should take a nap. You know, I have an idea. I have to run a few errands for Mr. Bell, okay, and then I'll pick up some food, and we can watch a movie, and in the meantime just get some sleep, okay? No, I'd like to come. No, it's okay, I'll be right back. See you later. Okay. Hey, Duke. What are you doin' here? Marie, text me. Oh, okay. She actually just fell asleep in my RV. She's... she's really shook after what happened last night. Yeah. Look, last night was fucked up. I do really care about Marie, though. She really needs us right now. I'm really glad you came. Marie told me about this place. It's cool. Fuck! I don't wanna do this. This was not part of my plan. But I will not let you stop me from completing it. Fuck you! It won't be for nothing. You made me do this. Thank you. Hey, babe, you back? Ugh. What the fuck. Hi. Hi. Oh shit, sorry, I got swamped. It's okay. Are those new? No. They're from my family's living room. - Oh. - I had them serviced. Don't they look good? Yeah. How are you feeling? Uh, better I guess. I think it was a relief knowing that the girl's alive. I bet. I need to talk to you about something. Over there. Okay. What's up? Okay, um, don't be mad, but I went into your room looking for you, and I saw this old iPod on a nightstand, and I thought you know, maybe your music could calm me down. But on it was this recording of a boy being punched and it was weird, and it was like a... a drum beat, but on a kid, and then there was this little girl giggling, and I thought maybe that was you. I mean it reminded me of the other night with the couple. Is that like your thing? No. The couple was different. They were enjoying themselves. Yeah, but the little boy wasn't. I was young. The orphanage was a fucked up place and when kids heard I killed my dad, they... Kids are assholes. Yeah. And that boy was a bully. But you were... you were enjoying it. Yeah, I was enacting my revenge and making music. In my young mind, that was cathartic. I was experimenting. I'm sorry that happened to you. Thanks. I'm sorry again that I've been so off with you lately. It's okay. I just... Oh, I missed you. I missed you, too. I need you more than you realize. Me, too, obviously. I mean it. I'm not very good at letting people in. I know. Shut up. I'm just... I'm just... I'm so distracted trying to create and... And deliver this music that has been burning in my soul. Mmhmm. And with the students, and I found out I might be losing my hearing again, and I... Wait, wait, wait, what? Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Thanks. Okay, well, I'm gonna be here with you, and we're gonna take care of it, we're gonna figure out what to do. It's gonna be okay, I mean whatever you need, okay? Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. I love you, too. Oh. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God, what the fuck! Oh my God, oh my God! I wish you hadn't seen that. Oh my God, what the fuck! Excuse me, do you need some help? Welcome back, sleepyhead. Let's see. Alright. Lavaliers, two wireless mics. One's checked out by documentary team, the other by... oh. Who? Oh, it's uh, Marie Sotker, she runs the workshop. Uh, she checked out the mic as well as some recording equipment. Excuse me. Fuentes. Okay, I'm on my way. Why did you kill Duke? Duke isn't dead. What? He's part of my music. Your fuckin' music? What the fuck are you talking about? Untie me! Untie me! I wish you could hear what I hear. Help, please! No one can hear you, okay? Please. I have to get back to work now. Please. Please, please, please, let me go. What are you doing? It's okay. It's okay. Please, please, Alexis, what are you trying to do? What are you doing? Please. It's okay. Please. It's okay. Love you. We don't have much time. Has anyone had access to your harp? I mean I just had it serviced. By who? Alexis. Alexis Reeves. She teaches at the university I go to. Did you leave your harp with her? Yes. Clear! Lin, send forensics to the garage, we have a body. No, it's a man. He was at the art gallery. Otherwise, the garage is empty. No RV here. She might be on the run. Put a BOLO out. Suspect RV located at Dockweiler Beach. Proceed with caution. Copy. Unit 88 en route. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Marie. Marie. Hey, are you okay? Hey. What the... I'm gonna call 911. Police! Out of the way! Get the fuck away! Marie, it's Detective Fuentes. Please, stop moving. Stay where you are, I'm here to help you. Where's Alexis? Stop, let me take a look at what she's done to you. Stay with me. No. Wake up. Marie! Marie!
