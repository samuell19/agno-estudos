Almost done. You want to piss me off, don't you? OK, OK, I"m finished You waste your time doing nothing, Tell me, what's the point of this game? To kill time. Piece of shit. Eh, aren't these all your clothes? None of your business, wring them out. Put them here. Hurry up. What"s the hurry? Look, still so much soap on them. Why is that? Didn't I just tell you to rinse them? Well, they're still covered in soap. Come on, I'm running late. OK, OK, what's the rush? Geez! It's annoying watching you do that. All right, all right. C'mon, finish wringing these out. Are you all right? Everything ok? I'm not feeling well. Then why did you drink so much? Forget it. Can I have an IV drip? Will it help? Did you take any medicine? Yes, I did. With an IV, I'll be better tomorrow. Fine, your call! You already have a bottle ready. Yeah. Where were you? How much did you drink? I don't even know, my boss was an idiot. I said no, but she kept making me toast. In the end I couldn't take any more and you know what my boss said? What? She said, "I'm so ashamed of you. You're such a light weight." At that point I was… She is an idiot, why did you go out with her? Couldn't you say no? What could I do, I had no choice. You knew what sort of company it was. Did you think I wanted to drink? If you didn't want to, you should have just said no. What could she do? Well. Not much. But I wouldn't have been able to survive in this company any longer. It's tough enough. Why don't you understand me? No, I don't understand you. It's hard enough to survive in that office. And as soon as I'm home, you start nagging me. I came back as soon as you called. Can't you just be nice to me? You're always like this. How can I be nice to you? You complain about aches and pains all the time… And yet you want to be promoted. I don't want to hear about it. You think I want to suffer? Don't you care about my pain? Always like this. If I don't care about you, why would I come back? Make a fist. There's no rubber band. I haven't done this for a while, I'm not quite sure how to. Where's the cotton bud? Have you squeezed it? Yes. Too small. The veins are too small. Press harder. Come on! Ah, I can't get the vein. Have you had dinner? Not really. What do you want to eat? I'll cook for you. I don't feel like eating. Be careful! Is it OK? OK. It's too small. Even a nurse couldn't do this. Are you taking tomorrow off? Don't go to work. No, I have to go. And leave at 7am as usual? Yes. Gosh. I feel like I'm dying. You look pale. Well, now… It's all right, I'll be fine after I had some sleep. Can you sleep? Yes. I still have some laundry left, I'll go and do it. Lie down here. By the way, everything's almost settled for our Shanghai trip. OK, that's good. Stay in bed. Sis, the customer didn't want this dress. Can I have it? No. The customer called saying she didn't want it. Well, I can't just give the clothes that the customer doesn't want. to any employee that wants them? All right, since you've been doing well… Fill in a form and sign it later. Thank you, Sis. That's ok I'll go back to work. Sure. What about your trip to Shanghai? I haven't decided yet. What's the problem? I don't have any savings, or qualifications. After I arrive... I have to first find a place to live. and then a job. There are so many things to take care of. Shanghai is a big city, anyway. You're still young, get out and chase your dream. Don't stay here working at dry-cleaners. Go find a job there with food and accommodation included. Save up a bit of money. That would be pretty good, right? Is there such a job? Definitely, but go there and see first. You don't even try. It's no use struggling now. I think Shanghai is good. What's good about it? At least it's better than here. It's a big city anyway. Isn't it stressful in the big city? The higher the stress, the more determined we are. You have no stress here? Sis, I'd like to ask you something. Is it OK if I take some time off? Where are you going? I haven't decided yet, just wanted to ask. What are the rules on annual leave? What's the longest period I can take? A week at the most. A week? Yes. OK, I see, sis. Hello, Meili? What? Well, I can't pay Nana's kindergarten tuition. Give me 1,000 Yuan, I really can't afford it. It's none of my business. Are you human? You don't even pay her tuition! I'm not human, are you goddamn human? Listen. I am not paying. And don't bother me again. Who will if you don't pay? Fine, I won't bother you again. Let's have a proper talk about it Come over to my place and we'll talk. Let's not be so stubborn. Get everything done, OK? Face to face. Let's talk. Listen. It's the last time I come over. And the last time we talk about this. So let's settle things today. Don't bother me anymore. Here, Meili, come in. My sister-in-law. You haven't eaten yet, right? Say what you want to say. Later, eat first. Here, let me serve you. I don't want to eat, just say it. I'm still cooking, go and sit over there. Come on, let me serve you. Hurry up! Come and eat first. Take some, let's talk after the meal. Come on! Have some. Don't touch me! This is donkey meat Han Ge brought. Come on! Have a bite. No. What's the matter? What do you mean? Why don't you show me some respect? What's wrong with you? So annoying! It's the way she is, nothing I can do. Her entire family knows her temper. Always giving me damn trouble. I just want a damn drink. I have to take care of every fucking one in this house. Her sister and the kid. They treat me like shit. Take it easy! Easy! Say what? What the fuck are you talking about? Can you hurry, sister? You eat first. I'm almost finished here. What? Can't you just come and eat. Damn it. No, how many times do I have to say it. Look at her. Fuck off! What the hell? It's just a dinner. I got some food for her, and she is fucking sick of me. Yes, I'm sick of you, you're disgusting! I'm disgusting? You're just a dirty bitch! Where did this damn child come from, don't you know? Bitch! Lesbian! That's enough! Or what? Is that all right? It's shameful. My friend is here, I'm trying not to piss you off. But you don't show me any fucking respect! Just a dinner. Pain in the ass! What? Why are you staring at me? Just eat some food! Fuck! Eat some fucking food! Eat! Fuck you! Meili, do you want to get killed? Just say what you want to say… You all go to hell! I will kill you. I’ll bloody kill you. It's all your damn fault. It’s all because of you. I'll kill you! Kill you! Talk to me! Shit! Piece of shit! You're all scum! Scum! Fuck you! Meili, well, you know, We've had fewer orders recently. Summer's coming! You said you want to leave as well. When we have more orders in winter, I will contact you. I'm so tired. I have something for you, a formal dress. What is it? A customer. said she didn't want it. Told us to donate it. It's still pretty good. It's still good! Why didn't she want it? Nice! Maybe she couldn't wear it after having a child. Try it on, it should look good on you. This fabric is good, too. I can definitely wear it. Just right for the office. I can take it to Shanghai. Right. Try it on now. Try it. Later. I'm a bit tired. Later, OK? All right! Are you packing up? Yeah. I just want to leave with you. Ah! Meili, I need to tell you something. What is it? Well, this trip to Shanghai will be with colleagues, and the company will arrange a place to stay. All of us will stay close. It might not be a good idea if you go. At first I thought, if we were together, we could look after each other. But after I heard what my boss said today… What if my colleagues gossip about us? It will only be a few months. How about you wait for me at home? I'll be back in a few months. Um! What? Are you upset? Huh. Um! What's the matter? Nothing! Come on! Say something! Meili, what are you doing? Don't pull it! Stop doing that, OK? Meili. Stop pulling it. Do you hear me? Let's talk about it, OK? I'll come back. I'm not leaving you. Stop being silly! You won't take me with you? Do you know what you said just now? Do I have a choice? You think I don't want to go with you? All right, you have no choice. So don't touch me, understand? You never get me. Right! Whatever you say. If you're happy, then we're good. If not, you get angry with me. Yes! So what? Why are you so selfish? When you are nice to me, I have to accept it, right? Throw it again, go on. So what! Bitch! Don't go! What are you doing? Don't go! I'll be late. Don't… I'll be late. Really, I'm running late. I beg you! Stay! Stay, please! Don't go! I am running late. Stop it. Stop. OK? Don't go, please! Meili, I'm at Karaoke near your place, come over. Meili. Who is this? Why did you order so much? Oh, my! I'll do the introductions. Let me introduce you first. This is Xiaoyu. This is Meili, Xiaoyu. Hello! Hello, Meili! What great snacks! This is awesome. I knew you would bring those. Really awesome. this one and this one… For you to eat. Here's more! Ah! And you always bring wine! I'll drink this. Go ahead! I gave my heart to you and left the sorrow to myself I gave my youth to you and kept the memories I gave my life to you and kept the loneliness to myself I gave spring to you and kept winter to myself Love is something no one can understand Love is an eternal melody Love is when happy tears fall Love used to be me, love used to be you I gave spring to you and kept winter to myself I kept your fading shadow but gave myself to you Love is over Please don't mention it again The lost love is gone No one needs to reminisce Love is over Please don't explain The past was like clouds Love is over Love is over Time flows by like a stream Running water soothes my heart These scars leave no trace Though you used to Express your true feelings I promised you My love will never change Why did you go without words? Tearing my heart into pieces Love is over Although I sighed Although I wept All is now in the past Love is over Time flows by like a stream Running water soothes my heart These scars leave no trace Ah, you're throwing up. We were almost there and you threw up. How can I make it up? Pay for my car to be cleaned. How much? At least 200 Yuan. What? 200. I don't have 200 Yuan. You clean my car then. I have no job, no money. Easy, we'll pay for it. I will. I will. OK I don't care who pays. I don't have 200 Yuan. All right, all right! 200 Yuan is not much. I don't have 200 Yuan. Xiaoyu, hurry up! Get her out of the car. All right, we will pay. Come on, let's go home. Hold her tight. I don't have 200 Yuan. All good, we'll pay it! We've already paid it Don't worry! I don't have a job. Don't cry, please! I don't have 200 Yuan. Don't cry! So sleepy! You embarrassed yourself yesterday. Yesterday？ You threw up in the car. Oh right, did you pay 200 Yuan? Yes! It was too much! He still has business to run. Washing the car doesn't cost much. What's the point of arguing with him? Who paid in the end? You? No, it was Xiaoyu. Then how can I pay him back? No need! I do't want to owe him money Ah, don't worry I can't get as much in as you. Didn't I say to put the vegetables in first? Vegetables. Am I not doing that? I am. You have to press them down first. Look, my dried bean curd. The boss will come and hit you. After a night of drinking, to sober up, spicy hotpot is a must! So true! You're done. You're really sick. Oh, come on! I have an upset stomach, no appetite. Really? Yeah! Is it because you threw up? It's a bit too spicy. I told you to use less spice. Mine is medium. Meili. Where are you going? To work. I got some breakfast for you and Wu Dan. Wanton. We already ate. You drank too much yesterday. This is good for you. I should… What's up? I should give you the money. Never mind. Take is. Come on, just take it. I have to go. Let's go together. No, no need. It's boring walking alone. Xiaoyu, I'm not interested in boys. And Wu Dan likes you. So let's just be friends. I think you misunderstood me. Because I think you are a nice girl. We need staff at our shop. Hopefully you can come and work with us. Hello! Sis. Come in. Sit there. Sis, I want to talk to you. Please let me keep my job. I can't find any suitable job now. And things didn't go well before either. Unfortunately your job was filled after you left. How about part-time? Business isn't good at the moment. We have more than enough staff. Can I come back when the business gets busier? Ah, well the business hasn't been good for a while. See? The roadwork outside is not helping our business. There aren't many customers. I'm not sure when our business will get better. So, it's best not to keep you waiting around. What's the number? Well, look. I'll call you. If I hear of any other work. Is that alright? OK, thank you. You're welcome. Bye, Sis. Bye. Wu Dan, I have something to tell you. What? Xiaoyu told me today that their mobile phone store is hiring. He asked me if I was interested. I thought I should ask you first. If you are uneasy, I won't go. Really! No, why should I be? It's good for you. I was just thinking about how to help you today. Just go there tomorrow. OK, I'll treat you when I get paid. You must! Deal! OK, don't stay up too late. See you. Bye-bye. Such a big screen, doesn't it use a lot of power? This year's s8 version uses the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. It uses 20 percent less power. So you don't have to worry about the battery life. And it takes just an hour to fully charge. Not bad. It's kind of slippery though. It would be tragic if you accidently dropped it. There is six months insurance for the screen. If the screen cracks, within the first six months, we'll replace it. You just have to pay 500 Yuan in labor costs, to get a brand new screen. The price is... 64G is 6188 Yuan, 128G is 6988 Yuan. It's a little too expensive. You get what you pay for. It's good, but… The processor is really fast. It's a lot cheaper to buy online. We have better after-sales service than online. What took you so long to reply? I didn't hear it, I've been so busy. Don't always get upset with me about these things. I didn't do it on purpose. Did you? How many times have you done this? I texted you, no reply. And I called you, no answer. Because I'm at work. You have your business. I have mine, You always make a fuss. Can't you grow up a bit? What, I am making a fuss? Yeah, you're mature enough. Mature enough to ignore others? Why are you being so nasty now? All right. It's my fault. Well, I don't want to talk about this. How about your sales today? Not too bad. By the way, our manager said today, since I've been working for a month now, there are employee discounts. If you want to get a new phone, just tell me. Really? That's great. What discount? It depends. Sometimes 100 Yuan. Sometimes 200 Yuan. Anyway, it varies. That's not bad. I searched for phones online the other day. There weren't any special offers. Meili, I'm sorry. I've been really busy recently. Otherwise I would have called you back much earlier. I've been thinking about you. I bought some gifts for you in Shanghai. Is that true? You're still thinking about me? Of course! Come to see me when I'm on holiday. I am just getting used to things here. Try your best. Don't be so hot tempered. Try to get along with others? OK. And remember to reply to me sooner. I've got to go. Bye-bye. Repeat after me: BIG SALE EVERYDAY. BIG SALE EVERYDAY. BIG SALE EVERYDAY. Boss, someone is looking for me, can I go? Go ahead! Thank you, boss. Why are you here? What are you doing here? Dad kicked us out, it's all your fault! My fault? It's got nothing to do with me! Who do you think you are? You came to my place that day looking for trouble. If you didn't, your brother-in-law wouldn't have beaten us? Why did he beat you? Because of me? Or because of that shit thing? How is it my problem? You came over and screwed it up, right? Bruises here and there and the mouth, too. Keep pulling it up. Up, Up! Show everyone. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I was hurt so bad I couldn't go to work, or take the kid to school either. What should I do? Go after him, not after me. I can't go back home now. You should help me. You have to take care of me for the next two months. I will look for a job after I recover. Why should I take care of you? Anyway, the child is yours… I tell you again. Don't bring it up to me. Don't you know how this child came about? You two couldn't have children, so asked me to… Don't bring up the past. Don't talk about it in front of the kid. It's all because of you two. When will you stop hurting me? Why did you come to me again? It's the last time. Help me. Find me a place to stay. After I get well, I'll find a job. You see, I have to see a doctor now. Not even a cent on me, please, Meili. I'll never bother you again after this. Listen, I have no mother, no father, no sister. Don't bother me again. Did you just say you won't bother me again? Yes, not any more. Record it for me. Record that you won't bother me any more. Don't worry. I and your brother-in-law will never bother you again. Who else? Us, the three of us, we won't come and bother you again. Just help me. What's the child's name? Who won't bother me anymore? Me, Nana and your brother-in-law. Relax. I promise that I will raise that child. Please help me one more time. I have no choice. Where are you going? To get the card. You stay there. I'll give you some cash for this month. and transfer some money again next month. Send me your account details by text. OK, OK. Don't come to me again. Thank you, Meili. Thank you. I just saw your message. What's up? You're in a bad mood? My sister came to the store today. She said that she and Nana had been kicked out because of me. She asked me for money, I had no choice. I gave her this month's wages. I'll have to wait a few months to buy you a phone. It doesn't matter. Your sister is a disaster! Just try to stay away from she. It's really annoying. By the way, I'll tell you something. There was an announcement today. Our company will buy into the Sunshine Private Fund. So, each employee can purchase some shares. It has much higher interest rates than a savings account. Really? What rate? According to past performance, it could be around 20%. Maybe even higher. Usually, it's sold starting from a minimum of one million on the market. and it's not for public purchase. OK, let's buy it together. I've checked my savings today. There's still 30,000 Yuan left. Well, 30,000… After one year. The profit will be at least 6000 Yuan in interest. Equivalent to your three months' wages. Tomorrow is the last day to sign up. Let's buy it together. Just transfer the money to me. Um, OK. Let me see. Tomorrow morning. I'll transfer it to you. OK, let's do this together. By the way, I'll head back to Changchun for business in a few days. We'll be able to meet then. Really? I'll pick you up. I'll cook something good for you. Well, stop being upset, ok? Don't think too much. I've got to go. Bye-bye. Meili, you may go and have your lunch. How did you finish yours so soon? That's just me. OK, I'm going. Meili, someone is looking for you. Me? Yes. Who is it? A man, it looks urgent. OK! Who is in charge here? May I help you, sir? Yes, yes. Bring me Meili. Looking for Meili? Sir, you can't smoke here. Stop, please. I'm looking for someone. What's it to you if I smoke or not. No smoking in public places, please put the cigarette out. Settle my affairs first. I'll smoke wherever I want. Get me Meili. Wait a minute, please. Hurry, hurry up! Meili, Meili, come here. I'm pissed off. Calm down Sir, let us know how we can help. Where is your sister, Meili? I don't know Where did your sister and the kid go? I can't find her anywhere. What have you done today? None of your business. Why did you come here? Manager, listen, you can't hire staff like her. Sir, put your cigarette out first. No, you have to solve this problem for me. You can't be like that, shouting here. How can she do her job in the shop. with a kid around? Now my wife is missing… You can talk to me about it if you like? I have to tell you the story, I mean… She's not a good girl, just like her sister, you know? Are you insane? I'm not bloody insane! I'm messed up, a bit drunk. Can you leave now. No, you must get this sorted for me. Manager, do you hear me? What's going on? Sorry. Calm down first. I quit. Is there anything I can do for you? I'm leaving now Meili. Don't touch me Where's your sister? Tell me. Get off! I give you one day to get this sorted. Otherwise… tomorrow I'll come after you again. Just right, check it. Correct. Thank you. Please come again! Hi! What's up? I need to talk to you. What? I think Xiaoyu is very honest and sincere. So we decided to have a relationship. Good, very good. There's one more thing. We discussed. and we are preparing to go to Shanghai. When did that happen? a few days ago. We thought it would be better to go to Shanghai. and get out of this stupid town. Well. Now, It's hard for me to just leave you. Fine. I'm fine. Fine. I'm fine. Hasn't it always been your dream to go to the big city? But what about you? I'm fine. I'm all right. Li Wen is coming back today. Don't cry! I'm so worried about you. Come on, I'm not a little girl. I can look after myself. You two are great. Really, he's a nice guy. He sure will take good care of you. Didn't you always want to go? I did. but when I think of you here by yourself, I… I feel so sad. Just go. Work hard. and I'll come to see you. Come and see me if you want. So have you decided when to leave? Tonight. Tonight? Have you packed your bags yet? He's doing it now. Have you arranged for a place to stay? We'll go there first, then look. Do you have enough time to find a place once you're there? Some friends there can help, too. What about your job? Go and see. Just give it a try. Don't cry. It's ok. I'm glad that you are able to leave. What about your parents? They agree? That's great. I'm afraid I can't see you off. Li Wen will come back tonight. You two are doing well? Good. I'll bring you over to Shanghai once I'm set up. Take good care of yourself. I hate to leave you. me too. Be good. I miss you so much! Let's go home. Did you miss me? Sure. Shanghai is so hot and stuffy. Really damp and humid. So uncomfortable. But you're not wearing much. Didn't I tell you? It's getting cold in Changchun, especially at night. Not too bad. Well, it's a bit cool, but I didn't bring a coat I didn't expect Changchun to be so cool. I told you before it is only ten degrees. The highest is nineteen degrees. Don't worry, I'm OK. What's this? It is for you. Is it nice? Yeah! Do you have one? Sure. One for you, one for me. Perfect! It is pretty, isn't it? I think it suits you. Look at yours. It's pretty! Then I'll put it on. Not this one… this one. Why do you have two phones? It's in Shanghai, you know. I can't always use my old number in Shanghai. It's a long-distance call, so I got a Shanghai number. But your previous number could be used for domestic calls? That Sim card wasn't great. This one is much better for Shanghai. and I bought one. So, which is this? This is the new one? Why didn't you tell me? I've been so busy, I didn't have time to. Someone's texting you. Can't you scrub out this stain? Never mind. Here's a rose for you. Are there any more? The petals all sank to the bottom. They were supposed to be put in later. I can't open it. Is it slippery? Oh good! Haha, Is that so? Ah, it's beautiful! Yeah, that's what it should be like. Those were put in too early, and sank to the bottom. Because we haven't done it before. It tickles. What was the result of the pregnancy test? Driver, please turn around and follow that white Toyota. Go straight ahead. A little faster, please. Hang on. Let me have a look. Yes, stay behind that car. The Red Roewe. Are you fucking insane? You're not a good girl, either. Stop pretending to be a pure one. Where is my money? What money? My money! All gone. I used it to pay off my credit card. Are you pregnant? So what? You also had a baby before. You really made a huge mistake this time. Who is it? Meili.
