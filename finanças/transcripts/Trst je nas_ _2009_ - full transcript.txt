Academy for theatre, radio, film and TV, Slovenian film fund, Viba film, RTV Slovenia Trieste is an Italian coastal city situated near the border with Slovenia. Although Slovenians were never a majority in Trieste, nearby Slovenian villages were vitally connected to the city. The ambition to free Trieste became especially strong during the Second World War? Trieste is ours! A short film by ?iga Virc Through the woods of Kras and to the sea, Where Trieste shines in the sun. Our thoughts and aspirations turn to our final victory. Oh, beloved fatherland, home of our ancestors. She waits for the days, when freedom finally comes. Now here we stand, ready for it to be finally realized. With a gun in hand, fearlessly towards victory we go. Marko! What?s the situation? The situation is dangerous. The Germans want to occupy Trieste. Trieste. And whose is Trieste, actually? Italy?s. - No. Germany?s.- No. Well, then it?s ours. Exactly. And who are we? We are the proud fighters of the 9th corps of the People?s Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia. The Italians have occupied Trieste, the Germans won?t. A new history begins. It?s time for the Slovenian nation to regain its former glory. See this hat? My father wore it when he was a partisan. Do you know when he gave it to me? Your father gave you this hat when you went to school. And he said this war must never be forgotten. Exactly. How did you know? Everyone knows that. Death to fascism! Freedom to the nation! Listen. When will you free Trieste? The day after tomorrow. But that?s what you also did last year, and the year before that. And fifteen years ago. I can?t take it anymore. I have to work. And you?re playing partisans and Germans. I?m not playing. Trieste was ours in May 1945 and it must be given back to the Slovenian nation. Marija! You know very well that Dad gave me this hat. The one he wore as a partisan. I know, I know. He said this war must never be forgotten. But I don?t think he meant that you should assemble a whole army! And re-enact battles like a bunch of five-year-olds! Fuck off. We will lose Trieste because of this shit. How are we doing, miss? Are we going to just wander around or will we help a little? Talking to yourself again, are we? I?ll show you talking to myself. Get to work! I will, I will. Why don?t you call Stalin? You two are chasing Mussolini together, aren?t you? Mateja, don?t make fun of such stuff. Do you see this hat? My Dad gave it to me. You know, he wore it when he was a partisan. Do you know when he gave it to me? - Yes, on your first school day. And he said the Second World War must never be forgotten. And he wore the same clothes you?re wearing, right? A road-worker?s uniform. Partisan! A partisan uniform! Yeah, it?s all the same. Mateja, are you asleep? Look. Look, do you see this hat? This one wasn?t my Dad?s hat. It was my Mom?s. Your Granny?s. But my Dad gave it to me. And he said: ?Make sure you give it to someone who will understand how brave our grandmas and our mothers were. They freed our country.? I?m giving it to you. So you?ll be brave. Where did we go wrong raising Mateja? What?s wrong with Mateja? She... I?ve got the feeling she has no clue. She doesn?t know. She?s not even aware ? she doesn?t know that there were divisions, brigades, that national heroes existed, that hostages were shot. I don?t think she knows any partisan songs. Hey brigades, hurry, Chase away, ruthlessly defeat, destroyers of Slovenian homes! Hey machine gun, sing your song, let it echo around us! Our salute from the free woods! Stop! Join! Attention! To the right! Attention! At ease! Comrades, fighters, friends! The times when the Slovenian nation was suppressed and no one cared are over! The battle approaches. The battle for Trieste. The battle for the heart and glory of the Slovenian nation. No sacrifice is too great! - Long live commander Franc! - Long may he live! Germans and traitors of the Slovenian nation will pay! Attention! Death to fascism! Freedom to the nation! Weapons check! Hey, France, I just wanted to ? - Hello. What? I just wanted to talk to you. - Oh, we?ll go to Jovanka, get a beer and talk everything through. No, we won?t go to Jovanka today, because this is too serious. Marko, finish the weapons inspection! Now, listen France. Obama is visiting the country and safety measures are tight. And the Americans are in it too. You know your battle re-enactment has to stop. - What? You know your circus doesn?t fit the concept, you understand? Now you listen to me. I don?t care if Osama bin Laden or Indira Ghandi or Arafat comes. The battle will happen! And soon. I just have to wait until the Germans attack and then it starts. Bring those containers and boxes back to headquarters! France, listen to me. Do you know who Obama is? Yes, I do, so? - Do you know I can lose my job because of you? Does this mean you?re one of them? One of who? - Look me in the eyes. Do you know my father wore this hat when he was a partisan? Do you know when he gave it to me? I know. When you went to school. Look, but you have to stop. Immediately. I have to stop this. Go away and take everything with you. Let?s go, let?s go. Josip Broz Tito?s speeches. Words with a therapeutic effect. We have shed a sea of blood for the fraternity and equality of our nations. And we won?t allow anyone to destroy this fraternity and equality. Comrades, today I have to confess a historical fact. I made a mistake about Trieste. Today I solemnly swear to you all: Trieste will be ours again! Through the woods of Kras and to the sea, where Trieste shines in the sun. Our thoughts and aspirations turn to our final victory. Oh, beloved fatherland, The home of our ancestors. She awaits ? Documents, please. - What? Documents. Whose vehicle is this? Well, it?s written that it?s still Marija?s. - What?s in the back? Ok, Jana, stop fooling around. What is all this about? Please, open the trunk. What is this? These are props for freeing Trieste. Listen, France, we have instructions from the commander to stop all such activities. We can?t let you go any further. Milena, now you listen to me. Do you have a license for all these weapons? No. Central dispatch, receive. - Which unit is reporting? 13. - Connecting to commander Brane. What?s the situation? - Brane, we got France. Over. Bring him to me at the station right away. If he happens to resist? Girls, don?t screw with me! Put the weapons down, hands in the air, now! Damn you collaborating bastards! Comrade France! The Germans are coming; they?ll be here any minute. Grab your weapons and take your positions now! - Go to your positions! Fire! Ninth, attack! Attack! ?iga! Franja! I?ll always love you. Grenade! This is the Slovenian police, drop your weapons now! This is the 9th corps of the People?s Liberation Army of Yugoslavia! Let us through or we will attack! France, stop this shit and put the weapons down. Brane, you stop this shit.
